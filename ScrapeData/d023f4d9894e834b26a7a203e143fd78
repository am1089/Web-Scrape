It consists of\n1096 stanzas, or about 4400 lines of verse. The subject is the marriage of the\ngod Shiva, the birth of his son, and the victory of this son over a powerful\ndemon. The story was not invented by Kalidasa, but taken from old mythology.\nYet it had never been told in so masterly a fashion as had been the story of\nRama\'s deeds by Valmiki. Kalidasa is therefore under less constraint in\nwriting this epic than in writing _The Dynasty of Raghu_. I give first a\nsomewhat detailed analysis of the matter of the poem.\n\n\n\n_First canto. The birth of Parvati_.--The poem begins with a description of\nthe great Himalaya mountain-range.\n\nGod of the distant north, the Snowy Range  \n  O\'er other mountains towers imperially;  \nEarth\'s measuring-rod, being great and free from change,  \n  Sinks to the eastern and the western sea.\n\nWhose countless wealth of natural gems is not  \n  Too deeply blemished by the cruel snow;  \nOne fault for many virtues is forgot,  \n  The moon\'s one stain for beams that endless flow.\n\nWhere demigods enjoy the shade of clouds  \n  Girding his lower crests, but often seek,  \nWhen startled by the sudden rain that shrouds  \n  His waist, some loftier, ever sunlit peak.\n\nWhere bark of birch-trees makes, when torn in strips  \n  And streaked with mountain minerals that blend  \nTo written words \'neath dainty finger-tips,  \n  Such dear love-letters as the fairies send. p. 158\n\nWhose organ-pipes are stems of bamboo, which  \n  Are filled from cavern-winds that know no rest,  \nAs if the mountain strove to set the pitch  \n  For songs that angels sing upon his crest.\n\nWhere magic herbs that glitter in the night  \n  Are lamps that need no oil within them, when  \nThey fill cave-dwellings with their shimmering light  \n  And shine upon the loves of mountain men.\n\nWho offers roof and refuge in his caves  \n  To timid darkness shrinking from the day;  \nA lofty soul is generous; he saves  \n  Such honest cowards as for protection pray.\n\nWho brings to birth the plants of sacrifice;  \n  Who steadies earth, so strong is he and broad.  \nThe great Creator, for this service\' price,  \n  Made him the king of mountains, and a god.\n\n[paragraph continues] Himalaya marries a wife, to whom in course of time a\ndaughter is born, as wealth is born when ambition pairs with character. The\nchild is named Parvati, that is, daughter of the mountain. Her father takes\ninfinite delight in her, as well he may; for\n\nShe brought him purity and beauty too,  \n  As white flames to the lamp that burns at night;  \nOr Ganges to the path whereby the true  \n  Reach heaven; or judgment to the erudite.\n\nShe passes through a happy childhood of sand-piles, balls, dolls, and little\ngirl friends, when all at once young womanhood comes upon her.\n\nAs pictures waken to the painter\'s brush,  \n  Or lilies open to the morning sun,  \nHer perfect beauty answered to the flush  \n  Of womanhood when childish days were done. p. 159\n\nSuppose a blossom on a leafy spray;  \n  Suppose a pearl on spotless coral laid:  \nSuch was the smile, pure, radiantly gay,  \n  That round her red, red lips for ever played.\n\nAnd when she spoke, the music of her tale  \n  Was sweet, the music of her voice to suit,  \nTill listeners felt as if the nightingale  \n  Had grown discordant like a jangled lute.\n\n[paragraph continues] It is predicted by a heavenly being that she will one\nday become the wife of the god Shiva. This prediction awakens her father\'s\npride, and also his impatience, since Shiva makes no advances. For the\ndestined bridegroom is at this time leading a life of stern austerity and\nself-denial upon a mountain peak. Himalaya therefore bids his daughter wait\nupon Shiva. She does so, but without being able to divert him from his\nausterities.\n\n\n\n_Second canto. Brahma\'s self-revelation_.--At this time, the gods betake\nthemselves to Brahma, the Creator, and sing a hymn of praise, a part of which\nis given here.\n\nBefore creation, thou art one;  \nThree, when creation\'s work is done:  \nAll praise and honour unto thee  \nIn this thy mystic trinity.\n\nThree various forms and functions three  \nProclaim thy living majesty;  \nThou dost create, and then maintain,  \nAnd last, destroyest all again.\n\nThy slow recurrent day and night  \nBring death to all, or living light.  \nWe live beneath thy waking eye;  \nThou sleepest, and thy creatures die.\n\nSolid and fluid, great and small,  \nAnd light and heavy--Thou art all;  \nMatter and form are both in thee:  \nThy powers are past discovery. p. 160\n\nThou art the objects that unroll  \nTheir drama for the passive soul;  \nThou art the soul that views the play  \nIndifferently, day by day.\n\nThou art the knower and the known;  \nEater and food art thou alone;  \nThe priest and his oblation fair;  \nThe prayerful suppliant and the prayer.\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahma receives their worship graciously, and asks the\nreason of their coming. The spokesman of the gods explains to Brahma how a\ngreat demon named Taraka is troubling the world, and how helpless they are in\nopposing him. They have tried the most extravagant propitiation, and found it\nuseless.\n\nThe sun in heaven dare not glow  \nWith undiminished heat, but so  \nAs that the lilies may awake  \nWhich blossom in his pleasure-lake.\n\nThe wind blows gently as it can  \nTo serve him as a soothing fan,  \nAnd dare not manifest its power,  \nLest it should steal a garden flower.\n\nThe seasons have forgotten how  \nTo follow one another now;  \nThey simultaneously bring  \nHim flowers of autumn, summer, spring.\n\nSuch adoration makes him worse;  \nHe troubles all the universe:  \nKindness inflames a rascal\'s mind;  \nHe should be recompensed in kind.\n\nAnd all the means that we have tried  \nAgainst the rogue, are brushed aside,  \nAs potent herbs have no avail  \nWhen bodily powers begin to fail. p. 161\n\nWe seek a leader, O our Lord,  \nTo bring him to his just reward--  \nAs saints seek evermore to win  \nVirtue, to end life\'s woe and sin--\n\nThat he may guide the heavenly host,  \nAnd guard us to the uttermost,  \nAnd from our foe lead captive back  \nThe victory which still we lack.\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahma answers that the demon\'s power comes from him,\nand he does not feel at liberty to proceed against it; "for it is not fitting\nto cut down even a poison-tree that one\'s own hand has planted." But he\npromises that a son shall be born to Shiva and Parvati, who shall lead the\ngods to victory. With this answer the gods are perforce content, and their\nking, Indra, waits upon the god of love, to secure his necessary co-operation.\n\n\n\n_Third canto. The burning of Love_.--Indra waits upon Love, who asks for his\ncommands. Indra explains the matter, and asks Love to inflame Shiva with\npassion for Parvati. Love thereupon sets out, accompanied by his wife Charm\nand his friend Spring. When they reach the mountain where Shiva dwells, Spring\nshows his power. The snow disappears; the trees put forth blossoms; bees,\ndeer, and birds waken to new life. The only living being that is not\ninfluenced by the sudden change of season is Shiva, who continues his\nmeditation, unmoved. Love himself is discouraged, until he sees the beauty of\nParvati, when he takes heart again. At this moment, Shiva chances to relax his\nmeditation, and Parvati approaches to do him homage. Love seizes the lucky\nmoment, and prepares to shoot his bewildering arrow at Shiva. But the great\ngod sees him, and before the arrow is discharged, darts fire from his eye,\nwhereby Love is consumed. Charm falls in a swoon, Shiva vanishes, and the\nwretched Parvati is carried away by her father.\n\n\n\n_Fourth canto. The lament of Charm_.--This canto is given entire.\n\np. 162\n\nThe wife of Love lay helpless in a swoon,  \n  Till wakened by a fate whose deadliest sting  \nWas preparation of herself full soon  \n  To taste the youthful widow\'s sorrowing.\n\nHer opening eyes were fixed with anxious thought  \n  On every spot where he might be, in vain,  \nWere gladdened nowhere by the sight she sought,  \n  The lover she should never see again.\n\nShe rose and cried aloud: "Dost thou yet live,  \n  Lord of my life?" And at the last she found  \nHim whom the wrathful god could not forgive,  \n  Her Love, a trace of ashes on the ground.\n\nWith breaking heart, with lovely bosom stained  \n  By cold embrace of earth, with flying hair,  \nShe wept and to the forest world complained,  \n  As if the forest in her grief might share.\n\n\n\n"Thy beauty slew the pride that maidens cherish;  \n  Perfect its loveliness in every part;  \nI saw that beauty fade away and perish,  \n  Yet did not die. How hard is woman\'s heart!\n\nWhere art thou gone? Thy love a moment only  \n  Endured, and I for ever need its power;  \nGone like the stream that leaves the lily lonely,  \n  When the dam breaks, to mourn her dying flower.\n\nThou never didst a thing to cause me anguish;  \n  I never did a thing to work thee harm;  \nWhy should I thus in vain affliction languish?  \n  Why not return to bless thy grieving Charm?\n\nOf playful chastisements art thou reminded,  \n  Thy flirtings punished by my girdle-strands,  \nThine eyes by flying dust of blossoms blinded,  \n  Held for thy meet correction in these hands? p. 163\n\nI loved to hear the name thou gav\'st me often  \n  \'Heart of my heart.\' Alas! It was not true,  \nBut lulling phrase, my coming grief to soften:  \n  Else in thy death, my life had ended, too.\n\nThink not that on the journey thou hast taken  \n  So newly, I should fail to find thy track;  \nAh, but the world! The world is quite forsaken,  \n  For life is love; no life, when thee they lack.\n\nThou gone, my love, what power can guide the maiden  \n  Through veils of midnight darkness in the town  \nTo the eager heart with loving fancies laden,  \n  And fortify against the storm-cloud\'s frown?\n\nThe wine that teaches eyes their gladdest dances,  \n  That bids the love-word trippingly to glide,  \nIs now deception; for if flashing glances  \n  Lead not to love, they lead to naught beside.\n\nAnd when he knows thy life is a remembrance,  \n  Thy friend the moon will feel his shining vain,  \nWill cease to show the world a circle\'s semblance,  \n  And even in his waxing time, will wane.\n\nSlowly the mango-blossoms are unfolding  \n  On twigs where pink is struggling with the green,  \nGreeted by koil-birds sweet concert holding--  \n  Thou dead, who makes of flowers an arrow keen?\n\nOr weaves a string of bees with deft invention,  \n  To speed the missile when the bow is bent?  \nThey buzz about me now with kind intention,  \n  And mortify the grief which they lament.\n\nArise! Assume again thy radiant beauty!  \n  Rebuke the koil-bird, whom nature taught  \nSuch sweet persuasion; she forgets her duty  \n  As messenger to bosoms passion-fraught. p. 164\n\nWell I remember, Love, thy suppliant motion,  \n  Thy trembling, quick embrace, the moments blest  \nBy fervent, self-surrendering devotion  \n  And memories like these deny me rest.\n\nWell didst thou know thy wife; the springtime garland,  \n  Wrought by thy hands, O charmer of thy Charm!  \nRemains to bid me grieve, while in a far land  \n  Thy body seeks repose from earthly harm.\n\nThy service by the cruel gods demanded,  \n  Meant service to thy wife left incomplete,  \nMy bare feet with coquettish streakings banded--  \n  Return to end the adorning of my feet.\n\nNo, straight to thee I fly, my body given,  \n  A headlong moth, to quick-consuming fire,  \nOr e\'er my cunning rivals, nymphs in heaven,  \n  Awake in thee an answering desire.\n\nYet, dearest, even this short delay is fated  \n  For evermore a deep reproach to prove,  \nA stain that may not be obliterated,  \n  If Charm has lived one moment far from Love.\n\nAnd how can I perform the last adorning  \n  Of thy poor body, as befits a wife?  \nSo strangely on the path that leaves me mourning  \n  Thy body followed still the spirit\'s life.\n\nI see thee straighten out thy blossom-arrow,  \n  The bow slung careless on thy breast the while,  \nThine eyes in mirthful, sidelong glance grow narrow,  \n  Thy conference with friendly Spring, thy smile.\n\nBut where is Spring? Dear friend, whose art could fashion  \n  The flowery arrow for thee? Has the wrath  \nOf dreadful Shiva, in excess of passion,  \n  Bade him, too, follow on that fatal path?"\n\nHeart-smitten by the accents of her grief  \n  Like poisoned darts, soothing her fond alarm,  \nIncarnate Spring appeared, to bring relief  \n  As friendship can, to sore-lamenting Charm.\n\nAnd at the sight of him, she wept the more,  \n  And often clutched her throat, and beat her breast;  \nFor lamentation finds an open door  \n  In the presence of the friends we love the best.\n\n\n\nStifling, she cried: "Behold the mournful matter!  \n  In place of him thou seekest, what is found?  \nA something that the winds of heaven scatter,  \n  A trace of dove-grey ashes on the ground.\n\nArise, O Love! For Spring knows no estranging,  \n  Thy friend in lucky hap and evil lot;  \nMan\'s love for wife is ever doubtful, changing;  \n  Man\'s love for man abides and changes not.\n\nWith such a friend, thy dart, on dainty pinion  \n  Of blossoms, shot from lotus-fibre string,  \nReduced men, giants, gods to thy dominion--  \n  The triple world has felt that arrow sting.\n\nBut Love is gone, far gone beyond returning,  \n  A candle snuffed by wandering breezes vain;  \nAnd see! I am his wick, with Love once burning,  \n  Now blackened by the smoke of nameless pain.\n\nIn slaying Love, fate wrought but half a slaughter,  \n  For I am left. And yet the clinging vine  \nMust fall, when falls the sturdy tree that taught her  \n  Round him in loving tenderness to twine.\n\nSo then, fulfil for me the final mission  \n  Of him who undertakes a kinsman\'s part;  \nCommit me to the flames (my last petition)  \n  And speed the widow to her husband\'s heart. p. 166\n\nThe moonlight wanders not, the moon forsaking;  \n  Where sails the cloud, the lightning is not far;  \nWife follows mate, is law of nature\'s making,  \n  Yes, even among such things as lifeless are.\n\nMy breast is stained; I lay among the ashes  \n  Of him I loved with all a woman\'s powers;  \nNow let me lie where death-fire flames and flashes,  \n  As glad as on a bed of budding flowers.\n\nSweet Spring, thou camest oft where we lay sleeping  \n  On blossoms, I and he whose life is sped;  \nUnto the end thy friendly office keeping,  \n  Prepare for me the last, the fiery bed.\n\nAnd fan the flame to which I am committed  \n  With southern winds; I would no longer stay;  \nThou knowest well how slow the moments flitted  \n  For Love, my love, when I was far away.\n\nAnd sprinkle some few drops of water, given  \n  In friendship, on his ashes and on me;  \nThat Love and I may quench our thirst in heaven  \n  As once on earth, in heavenly unity.\n\nAnd sometimes seek the grave where Love is lying;  \n  Pause there a moment, gentle Spring, and shower  \nSweet mango-clusters to the winds replying;  \n  For he thou lovedst, loved the mango-flower."\n\n\n\nAs Charm prepared to end her mortal pain  \n  In fire, she heard a voice from heaven cry,  \nThat showed her mercy, as the early rain  \n  Shows mercy to the fish, when lakes go dry:\n\n"O wife of Love! Thy lover is not lost  \n  For evermore. This voice shall tell thee why  \nHe perished like the moth, when he had crossed  \n  The dreadful god, in fire from Shiva\'s eye. p. 167\n\nWhen darts of Love set Brahma in a flame,  \n  To shame his daughter with impure desire,  \nHe checked the horrid sin without a name,  \n  And cursed the god of love to die by fire.\n\nBut Virtue interceded in behalf  \n  Of Love, and won a softening of the doom:  \n\'Upon the day when Shiva\'s heart shall laugh  \n  In wedding joy, for mercy finding room,\n\nHe shall unite Love\'s body with the soul,  \n  A marriage-present to his mountain bride.\'  \nAs clouds hold fire and water in control,  \n  Gods are the fount of wrath, and grace beside.\n\nSo, gentle Charm, preserve thy body sweet  \n  For dear reunion after present pain;  \nThe stream that dwindles in the summer heat,  \n  Is reunited with the autumn rain."\n\nInvisibly and thus mysteriously  \n  The thoughts of Charm were turned away from death;  \nAnd Spring, believing where he might not see,  \n  Comforted her with words of sweetest breath.\n\nThe wife of Love awaited thus the day,  \n  Though racked by grief, when fate should show its power,  \nAs the waning moon laments her darkened ray  \n  And waits impatient for the twilight hour.\n\n\n\n_Fifth canto. The reward of self-denial_.--Parvati reproaches her own beauty,\nfor "loveliness is fruitless if it does not bind a lover." She therefore\nresolves to lead a life of religious self-denial, hoping that the merit thus\nacquired will procure her Shiva\'s love. Her mother tries in vain to dissuade\nher; her father directs her to a fit mountain peak, and she retires to her\ndevotions. She lays aside all ornaments, lets her hair hang unkempt, and\nassumes the hermit\'s dress of bark. While she is spending her days in self-\ndenial, she is visited by a Brahman youth, who compliments her highly upon her\nrigid devotion, and declares that her conduct proves the\n\np. 168\n\ntruth of the proverb: Beauty can do no wrong. Yet he confesses himself\nbewildered, for she seems to have everything that heart can desire. He\ntherefore asks her purpose in performing these austerities, and is told how\nher desires are fixed upon the highest of all objects, upon the god Shiva\nhimself, and how, since Love is dead, she sees no way to win him except by\nascetic religion. The youth tries to dissuade Parvati by recounting all the\ndreadful legends that are current about Shiva: how he wears a coiling snake on\nhis wrist, a bloody elephant-hide upon his back, how he dwells in a graveyard,\nhow he rides upon an undignified bull, how poor he is and of unknown birth.\nParvati\'s anger is awakened by this recital. She frowns and her lip quivers as\nshe defends herself and the object of her love.\n\nShiva, she said, is far beyond the thought  \n  Of such as you: then speak no more to me.  \nDull crawlers hate the splendid wonders wrought  \n  By lofty souls untouched by rivalry.\n\nThey search for wealth, whom dreaded evil nears,  \n  Or they who fain would rise a little higher;  \nThe world\'s sole refuge neither hopes nor fears  \n  Nor seeks the objects of a small desire.\n\nYes, he is poor, yet he is riches\' source;  \n  This graveyard-haunter rules the world alone;  \nDreadful is he, yet all beneficent force:  \n  Think you his inmost nature can be known?\n\nAll forms are his; and he may take or leave  \n  At will, the snake, or gem with lustre white;  \nThe bloody skin, or silk of softest weave;  \n  Dead skulls, or moonbeams radiantly bright.\n\nFor poverty he rides upon a bull,  \n  While Indra, king of heaven, elephant-borne,  \nBows low to strew his feet with beautiful,  \n  Unfading blossoms in his chaplet worn.\n\nYet in the slander spoken in pure hate  \n  One thing you uttered worthy of his worth: p. 169  \nHow could the author of the uncreate  \n  Be born? How could we understand his birth?\n\nEnough of this! Though every word that you  \n  Have said, be faithful, yet would Shiva please  \nMy eager heart all made of passion true  \n  For him alone. Love sees no blemishes.\n\n[paragraph continues] In response to this eloquence, the youth throws off his\ndisguise, appearing as the god Shiva himself, and declares his love for her.\nParvati immediately discontinues her religious asceticism; for "successful\neffort regenerates."\n\n\n\n_Sixth canto. Parvati is given in marriage_.--While Parvati departs to inform\nher father of what has happened, Shiva summons the seven sages, who are to\nmake the formal proposal of marriage to the bride\'s parents. The seven sages\nappear, flying through the air, and with them Arundhati, the heavenly model of\nwifely faith and devotion. On seeing her, Shiva feels his eagerness for\nmarriage increase, realising that\n\nAll actions of a holy life  \nAre rooted in a virtuous wife.\n\n[paragraph continues] Shiva then explains his purpose, and sends the seven\nsages to make the formal request for Parvati\'s hand. The seven sages fly to\nthe brilliant city of Himalaya, where they are received by the mountain god.\nAfter a rather portentous interchange of compliments, the seven sages announce\ntheir errand, requesting Parvati\'s hand in behalf of Shiva. The father\njoyfully assents, and it is agreed that the marriage shall be celebrated after\nthree days. These three days are spent by Shiva in impatient longing.\n\n\n\n_Seventh canto. Parvati\'s wedding_.--The three days are spent in preparations\nfor the wedding. So great is Parvati\'s unadorned beauty that the waiting-women\ncan hardly take their eyes from her to inspect the wedding-dress. But the\npreparations are complete at last; and the bride is beautiful indeed.\n\np. 170\n\nAs when the flowers are budding on a vine,  \n  Or white swans rest upon a river\'s shore,  \nOr when at night the stars in heaven shine,  \n  Her lovely beauty grew with gems she wore.\n\nWhen wide-eyed glances gave her back the same  \n  Bright beauty--and the mirror never lies--  \nShe waited with impatience till he came:  \n  For women dress to please their lovers\' eyes.\n\n[paragraph continues] Meanwhile Shiva finishes his preparations, and sets out\non his wedding journey, accompanied by Brahma, Vishnu, and lesser gods. At his\njourney\'s end, he is received by his bride\'s father, and led through streets\nankle-deep in flowers, where the windows are filled with the faces of eager\nand excited women, who gossip together thus:\n\nFor his sake it was well that Parvati  \n  Should mortify her body delicate;  \nThrice happy might his serving-woman be,  \n  And infinitely blest his bosom\'s mate.\n\n[paragraph continues] Shiva and his retinue then enter the palace, where he is\nreceived with bashful love by Parvati, and the wedding is celebrated with due\npomp. The nymphs of heaven entertain the company with a play, and Shiva\nrestores the body of Love.\n\n_Eighth canto. The honeymoon_.--The first month of marital bliss is spent in\nHimalaya\'s palace. After this the happy pair wander for a time among the\nfamous mountain-peaks. One of these they reach at sunset, and Shiva describes\nthe evening glow to his bride. A few stanzas are given here.\n\nSee, my beloved, how the sun  \n  With beams that o\'er the water shake  \nFrom western skies has now begun  \n  A bridge of gold across the lake.\n\nUpon the very tree-tops sway  \n  The peacocks; even yet they hold p. 171  \nAnd drink the dying light of day,  \n  Until their fans are molten gold.\n\nThe water-lily closes, but  \n  With wonderful reluctancy;  \nAs if it troubled her to shut  \n  Her door of welcome to the bee.\n\nThe steeds that draw the sun\'s bright car,  \n  With bended neck and falling plume  \nAnd drooping mane, are seen afar  \n  To bury day in ocean\'s gloom.\n\nThe sun is down, and heaven sleeps:  \n  Thus every path of glory ends;  \nAs high as are the scaled steeps,  \n  The downward way as low descends.\n\n[paragraph continues] Shiva then retires for meditation. On his return, he\nfinds that his bride is peevish at being left alone even for a little time,\nand to soothe her, he describes the night which is now advancing. A few\nstanzas of this description run as follows.\n\nThe twilight glow is fading far  \n  And stains the west with blood-red light,  \nAs when a reeking scimitar  \n  Slants upward on a field of fight.\n\nAnd vision fails above, below,  \n  Around, before us, at our back;  \nThe womb of night envelops slow  \n  The world with darkness vast and black.\n\nMute while the world is dazed with light,  \n  The smiling moon begins to rise  \nAnd, being teased by eager night,  \n  Betrays the secrets of the skies.\n\nMoon-fingers move the black, black hair  \n  Of night into its proper place,  \nWho shuts her eyes, the lilies fair,  \n  As he sets kisses on her face.\n\np. 172\n\n[paragraph continues] Shiva and Parvati then drink wine brought them by the\nguardian goddess of the grove, and in this lovely spot they dwell happily for\nmany years.\n\n\n\n_Ninth canto. The journey to Mount Kailasa_.--One day the god of fire appears\nas a messenger from the gods before Shiva, to remonstrate with him for not\nbegetting the son upon whom heaven\'s welfare depends. Shiva deposits his seed\nin Fire, who departs, bent low with the burden. Shortly afterwards the gods\nwait upon Shiva and Parvati, who journey with them to Mount Kailasa, the\nsplendid dwelling-place of the god of wealth. Here also Shiva and Parvati\nspend happy days.\n\n\n\n_Tenth canto. The birth of Kumara_.--To Indra, king of the gods, Fire betakes\nhimself, tells his story, and begs to be relieved of his burden. Indra advises\nhim to deposit it in the Ganges. Fire therefore travels to the Ganges, leaves\nShiva\'s seed in the river, and departs much relieved. But now it is the turn\nof Ganges to be distressed, until at dawn the six Pleiades come to bathe in\nthe river. They find Shiva\'s seed and lay it in a nest of reeds, where it\nbecomes a child, Kumara, the future god of war.\n\n\n\n_Eleventh canto. The birth of Kumara, continued_.--Ganges suckles the\nbeautiful infant. But there arises a dispute for the possession of the child\nbetween Fire, Ganges, and the Pleiades. At this point Shiva and Parvati\narrive, and Parvati, wondering at the beauty of the infant and at the strange\nquarrel, asks Shiva to whom the child belongs. When Shiva tells her that\nKumara is their own child, her joy is unbounded.\n\nBecause her eyes with happy tears were dim,  \n  \'Twas but by snatches that she saw the boy;  \nYet, with her blossom-hand caressing him,  \n  She felt a strange, an unimagined joy.\n\nThe vision of the infant made her seem  \n  A flower unfolding in mysterious bliss; p. 173  \nOr, billowy with her joyful tears, a stream;  \n  Or pure affection, perfect in a kiss.\n\n[paragraph continues] Shiva conducts Parvati and the boy back to Mount\nKailasa, where gods and fairies welcome them with music and dancing. Here the\ndivine child spends the days of a happy infancy, not very different from human\ninfancy; for he learns to walk, gets dirty in the courtyard, laughs a good\ndeal, pulls the scanty hair of an old servant, and learns to count: "One,\nnine, two, ten, five, seven." These evidences of healthy development cause\nShiva and Parvati the most exquisite joy.\n\n\n\n_Twelfth canto. Kumara is made general_.--Indra, with the other gods, waits\nupon Shiva, to ask that Kumara, now a youth, may be lent to them as their\nleader in the campaign against Taraka. The gods are graciously received by\nShiva, who asks their errand. Indra prefers their request, where- upon Shiva\nbids his son assume command of the gods, and slay Taraka. Great is the joy of\nKumara himself, of his mother Parvati, and of Indra.\n\n\n\n_Thirteenth canto. Kumara is consecrated general_.--Kumara takes an\naffectionate farewell of his parents, and sets out with the gods. When they\ncome to Indra\'s paradise, the gods are afraid to enter, lest they find their\nenemy there. There is an amusing scene in which each courteously invites the\nothers to precede him, until Kumara ends their embarrassment by leading the\nway. Here for the first time Kumara sees with deep respect the heavenly\nGanges, Indra\'s garden and palace, and the heavenly city. But he becomes red-\neyed with anger on beholding the devastation wrought by Taraka.\n\nHe saw departed glory, saw the state  \n  Neglected, ruined, sad, of Indra\'s city,  \nAs of a woman with a cowardly mate:  \n  And all his inmost heart dissolved in pity.\n\nHe saw how crystal floors were gashed and torn  \n  By wanton tusks of elephants, were strewed p. 174  \nWith skins that sloughing cobras once had worn:  \n  And sadness overcame him as he viewed.\n\nHe saw beside the bathing-pools the bowers  \n  Defiled by elephants grown overbold,  \nStrewn with uprooted golden lotus-flowers,  \n  No longer bright with plumage of pure gold,\n\nRough with great, jewelled columns overthrown,  \n  Rank with invasion of the untrimmed grass:  \nShame strove with sorrow at the ruin shown,  \n  For heaven\'s foe had brought these things to pass.\n\n[paragraph continues] Amid these sorrowful surroundings the gods gather and\nanoint Kumara, thus consecrating him as their general.\n\n\n\n_Fourteenth canto. The march_.--Kumara prepares for battle, and marshals his\narmy. He is followed by Indra riding on an elephant, Agni on a ram, Yama on a\nbuffalo, a giant on a ghost, Varuna on a dolphin, and many other lesser gods.\nWhen all is ready, the army sets out on its dusty march.\n\n\n\n_Fifteenth canto. The two armies clash_.--The demon Taraka is informed that\nthe hostile army is approaching, but scorns the often-conquered Indra and the\nboy Kumara. Nevertheless, he prepares for battle, marshals his army, and sets\nforth to meet the gods. But he is beset by dreadful omens of evil.\n\nFor foul birds came, a horrid flock to see,  \n  Above the army of the foes of heaven,  \nAnd dimmed the sun, awaiting ravenously  \n  The feast of demon corpses to be given.\n\nAnd monstrous snakes, as black as powdered soot,  \n  Spitting hot poison high into the air,  \nBrought terror to the army underfoot,  \n  And crept and coiled and crawled before them there.\n\nThe sun a sickly halo round him had;  \n  Coiling within it frightened eyes could see p. 175  \nGreat, writhing serpents, enviously glad  \n  Because the demon\'s death so soon should be.\n\nAnd in the very circle of the sun  \n  Were phantom jackals, snarling to be fed;  \nAnd with impatient haste they seemed to run  \n  To drink the demon\'s blood in battle shed.\n\nThere fell, with darting flame and blinding flash  \n  Lighting the farthest heavens, from on high  \nA thunderbolt whose agonising crash  \n  Brought fear and shuddering from a cloudless sky.\n\nThere came a pelting rain of blazing coals  \n  With blood and bones of dead men mingled in;  \nSmoke and weird flashes horrified their souls;  \n  The sky was dusty grey like asses\' skin.\n\nThe elephants stumbled and the horses fell,  \n  The footmen jostled, leaving each his post,  \nThe ground beneath them trembled at the swell  \n  Of ocean, when an earthquake shook the host.\n\nAnd dogs before them lifted muzzles foul  \n  To see the sun that lit that awful day,  \nAnd pierced the ears of listeners with a howl  \n  Dreadful yet pitiful, then slunk away.\n\n[paragraph continues] Taraka\'s counsellors endeavour to persuade him to turn\nback, but he refuses; for timidity is not numbered among his faults. As he\nadvances even worse portents appear, and finally warning voices from heaven\ncall upon him to desist from his undertaking. The voices assure him of\nKumara\'s prowess and inevitable victory; they advise him to make his peace\nwhile there is yet time. But Taraka\'s only answer is a defiance.\n\n"You mighty gods that flit about in heaven  \n  And take my foeman\'s part, what would you say?  \nHave you forgot so soon the torture given  \n  By shafts of mine that never miss their way? p. 176\n\nWhy should I fear before a six-days child?  \n  Why should you prowl in heaven and gibber shrill,  \nLike dogs that in an autumn night run wild,  \n  Like deer that sneak through forests, trembling still?\n\nThe boy whom you have chosen as your chief  \n  In vain upon his hermit-sire shall cry;  \nThe upright die, if taken with a thief:  \n  First you shall perish, then he too shall die."\n\n[paragraph continues] And as Taraka emphasises his meaning by brandishing his\ngreat sword, the warning spirits flee, their knees knocking together. Taraka\nlaughs horribly, then mounts his chariot, and advances against the army of the\ngods. On the other side the gods advance, and the two armies clash.\n\n\n\n_Sixteenth canto. The battle between gods and demons_.--This canto is entirely\ntaken up with the struggle between the two armies. A few stanzas are given\nhere.\n\nAs pairs of champions stood forth  \nTo test each other\'s fighting worth,  \nThe bards who knew the family fame  \nProclaimed aloud each mighty name.\n\nAs ruthless weapons cut their way  \nThrough quilted armour in the fray,  \nWhite tufts of cotton flew on high  \nLike hoary hairs upon the sky.\n\nBlood-dripping swords reflected bright  \nThe sunbeams in that awful fight;  \nFire-darting like the lightning-flash,  \nThey showed how mighty heroes clash.\n\nThe archers\' arrows flew so fast,  \nAs through a hostile breast they passed,  \nThat they were buried in the ground,  \nNo stain of blood upon them found. p. 177\n\nThe swords that sheaths no longer clasped,  \nThat hands of heroes firmly grasped,  \nFlashed out in glory through the fight,  \nAs if they laughed in mad delight.\n\nAnd many a warrior\'s eager lance  \nShone radiant in the eerie dance,  \nA curling, lapping tongue of death  \nTo lick away the soldier\'s breath.\n\nSome, panting with a bloody thirst,  \nFought toward the victim chosen first,  \nBut had a reeking path to hew  \nBefore they had him full in view.\n\nGreat elephants, their drivers gone  \nAnd pierced with arrows, struggled on,  \nBut sank at every step in mud  \nblade liquid by the streams of blood.\n\nThe warriors falling in the fray,  \nWhose heads the sword had lopped away,  \nWere able still to fetch a blow  \nThat slew the loud-exulting foe.\n\nThe footmen thrown to Paradise  \nBy elephants of monstrous size,  \nWere seized upon by nymphs above,  \nExchanging battle-scenes for love.\n\nThe lancer, charging at his foe,  \nWould pierce him through and bring him low,  \nAnd would not heed the hostile dart  \nThat found a lodgment in his heart.\n\nThe war-horse, though unguided, stopped  \nThe moment that his rider dropped,  \nAnd wept above the lifeless head,  \nStill faithful to his master dead. p. 178\n\nTwo lancers fell with mortal wound  \nAnd still they struggled on the ground;  \nWith bristling hair, with brandished knife,  \nEach strove to end the other\'s life.\n\nTwo slew each other in the fight;  \nTo Paradise they took their flight;  \nThere with a nymph they fell in love,  \nAnd still they fought in heaven above.\n\nTwo souls there were that reached the sky;  \nFrom heights of heaven they could spy  \nTwo writhing corpses on the plain,  \nAnd knew their headless forms again.\n\nAs the struggle comes to no decisive issue, Taraka seeks out the chief gods,\nand charges upon them.\n\n\n\n_Seventeenth canto. Taraka is slain_.--Taraka engages the principal gods and\ndefeats them with magic weapons. When they are relieved by Kumara, the demon\nturns to the youthful god of war, and advises him to retire from the battle.\n\nStripling, you are the only son  \n  Of Shiva and of Parvati.  \nGo safe and live! Why should you run  \nOn certain death? Why fight with me?  \nWithdraw! Let sire and mother blest  \nClasp living son to joyful breast.\n\nFlee, son of Shiva, flee the host  \n  Of Indra drowning in the sea  \nThat soon shall close upon his boast  \n  In choking waves of misery.  \nFor Indra is a ship of stone;  \nWithdraw, and let him sink alone.\n\n[paragraph continues] Kumara answers with modest firmness.\n\nThe words you utter in your pride,  \n  O demon- prince, are only fit; p. 179  \nYet I am minded to abide  \n  The fight, and see the end of it.  \nThe tight-strung bow and brandished sword  \nDecide, and not the spoken word.\n\n[paragraph continues] And with this the duel begins. When Taraka finds his\narrows parried by Kumara, he employs the magic weapon of the god of wind. When\nthis too is parried, he uses the magic weapon of the god of fire, which Kumara\nneutralises with the weapon of the god of water. As they fight on, Kumara\nfinds an opening, and slays Taraka with his lance, to the unbounded delight of\nthe universe.\n\nHere the poem ends, in the form in which it has come down to us. It has been\nsometimes thought that we have less than Kalidasa wrote, partly because of a\nvague tradition that there were once twenty-three cantos, partly because the\ncustomary prayer is lacking at the end. These arguments are not very cogent.\nThough the concluding prayer is not given in form, yet the stanzas which\ndescribe the joy of the universe fairly fill its place. And one does not see\nwith what matter further cantos would be concerned. The action promised in the\nearlier part is completed in the seventeenth canto.\n\nIt has been somewhat more formidably argued that the concluding cantos are\nspurious, that Kalidasa wrote only the first seven or perhaps the first eight\ncantos. Yet, after all, what do these arguments amount to? Hardly more than\nthis, that the first eight cantos are better poetry than the last nine. As if\na poet were always at his best, even when writing on a kind of subject not\ncalculated to call out his best. Fighting is not Kalidasa\'s _forte_ ; love is.\nEven so, there is great vigour in the journey of Taraka, the battle, and the\nduel. It may not be the highest kind of poetry, but it is wonderfully vigorous\npoetry of its kind. And if we reject the last nine cantos, we fall into a very\nmuch greater difficulty. The poem would be glaringly incomplete, its early\npromise obviously disregarded. We should have a _Birth of the War- god_ in\nwhich the poet stopped before the war-god was born.\n\nThere seems then no good reason to doubt that we have the epic substantially\nas Kalidasa wrote it. Plainly, it has a unity which is lacking in Kalidasa\'s\nother epic, _The Dynasty_  \n\np. 180\n\n_of Raghu_ , though in this epic, too, the interest shifts. Parvati\'s love-\naffair is the matter of the first half, Kumara\'s fight with the demon the\nmatter of the second half. Further, it must be admitted that the interest runs\na little thin. Even in India, where the world of gods runs insensibly into the\nworld of men, human beings take more interest in the adventures of men than of\ngods. The gods, indeed, can hardly have adventures; they must be victorious.\n_The Birth of the War-god_ pays for its greater unity by a poverty of\nadventure.\n\nIt would be interesting if we could know whether this epic was written before\nor after _The Dynasty of Raghu_. But we have no data for deciding the\nquestion, hardly any for even arguing it. The introduction to _The Dynasty of\nRaghu_ seems, indeed, to have been written by a poet who yet had his spurs to\nwin. But this is all.\n\nAs to the comparative excellence of the two epics, opinions differ. My own\npreference is for _The Dynasty of Raghu_ , yet there are passages in _The\nBirth of the War-god_ of a piercing beauty which the world can never let die.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Cloud-Messenger](sha17.htm)\n\n'
