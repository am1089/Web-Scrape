Moreover it is so stated in Sm _ri_ ti.\n\nIn the \xc3\x8e _s_ varagitas (Bhagavad-gita) also it is said that the soul is a part\nof the Lord, 'an eternal part of me becomes the individual soul in the world\nof life' (Bha. Gi. XV, 7). With regard to the assertion made above, viz. that\nin ordinary life the relation of ruler and ruled is known to hold good in the\ncase of master and servant &c. only, we remark that, although that may be the\ncase in ordinary life, we ascertain from scripture that the relation of part\nand whole and that of ruler and ruled may go together. Nor is there anything\ncontradictory in assuming that the Lord who is provided with superexcellent\nlimiting adjuncts rules the souls which are connected with inferior adjuncts\nonly.\n\nHere the purvapakshin raises another objection. If we admit that the souls are\nparts of the Lord, it follows that the Lord also, whose part the soul is, will\nbe afflicted by the pain caused to the soul by its experience of the sa _m_\nsara-state; as we see in ordinary life that the entire Devadatta suffers from\nthe pain affecting his hand or foot or some other limb. Herefrom it would\nfollow that they who obtain Brahman obtain a greater pain 1: so that the\nformer sa _m_ sara-condition would be preferable, and complete knowledge be\ndevoid of purpose.--To this the following Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[63:1](sbe38046.htm#fr_42) Viz. by participating in all pain.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 46](sbe38047.htm)\n\n"
