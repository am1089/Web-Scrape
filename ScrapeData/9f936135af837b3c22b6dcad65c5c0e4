You yourself admit\nthat in the case of knowledge and in that of colour and other qualities this\nrelation holds good, viz. that something which gives rise to a judgment about\nanother thing at the same time gives rise to a judgment about itself; the same\nmay therefore be admitted with regard to difference 1.\n\nFor this reason the charge of a regressus in infinitum and a logical seesaw\n(see above, p. 32) cannot be upheld. For even if perceptive cognition takes\nplace within one moment, we apprehend within that moment the generic character\nwhich constitutes on the one hand the difference of the thing from others, and\non the other hand the peculiar character of the thing itself; and thus there\nremains nothing to be apprehended in a second moment.\n\nMoreover, if perception made us apprehend only pure Being judgments clearly\nreferring to different objects--such as 'Here is a jar,' 'There is a piece of\ncloth'--would be devoid of all meaning. And if through perception we did not\napprehend difference--as marked by generic character, &c., constituting the\nstructure or make of a thing, why should a man searching for a horse not be\nsatisfied with finding a buffalo? And if mere Being only were the object of\nall our cognitions, why should we not remember,\n\np. 45\n\nin the case of each particular cognition, all the words which are connected\nwith all our cognitions? And further, if the cognition of a horse and that of\nan elephant had one object only, the later cognition would cause us to\napprehend only what was apprehended before, and there being thus no difference\n(of object of cognition) there would be nothing to distinguish the later state\nof cognition from remembrance. If on the other hand a difference is admitted\nfor each state of consciousness, we admit thereby that perception has for its\nobjects things affected with difference.\n\nIf all acts of cognition had one and the same object only, everything would be\napprehended by one act of cognition; and from this it would follow that there\nare no persons either deaf or blind!\n\nNor does, as a matter of fact, the eye apprehend mere Being only; for what it\ndoes apprehend is colour and the coloured thing, and those other qualities\n(viz. extension, &c.), which inhere in the thing together with colour. Nor\ndoes feeling do so; for it has for its objects things palpable. Nor have the\near and the other senses mere Being for their object; but they relate to what\nis distinguished by a special sound or taste or smell. Hence there is not any\nsource of knowledge causing us to apprehend mere Being. If moreover the senses\nhad for their object mere Being free from all difference, it would follow that\nScripture which has the same object would (not be originative of knowledge\nbut) perform the function of a mere anuvada, i.e. it would merely make\nstatements about something, the knowledge of which is already established by\nsome other means. And further, according to your own doctrine, mere Being,\ni.e. Brahman, would hold the position of an object with regard to the\ninstruments of knowledge; and thus there would cling to it all the\nimperfections indicated by yourself--non-intelligent nature, perishableness\nand so on.--From all this we conclude that perception has for its object only\nwhat is distinguished by difference manifesting itself in generic character\nand so on, which constitute the make or structure of a thing. (That the\ngeneric character of a thing is nothing else but its particular structure\nfollows) from the\n\np. 46\n\nfact that we do not perceive anything, different from structure, which could\nbe claimed as constituting the object of the cognition that several\nindividuals possess one and the same general form. And as our theory\nsufficiently accounts for the ordinary notions as to generic character, and as\nmoreover even those who hold generic character to be something different from\nstructure admit that there is such a thing as (common) structure, we adhere to\nthe conclusion that generic character is nothing but structure. By 'structure'\nwe understand special or distinctive form; and we acknowledge different forms\nof that kind according to the different classes of things. And as the current\njudgments as to things being different from one another can be explained on\nthe basis of the apprehension of generic character, and as no additional\nentity is observed to exist, and as even those who maintain the existence of\nsuch an additional thing admit the existence of generic character, we further\nconclude that difference (bheda) is nothing but generic character ( _g_ ati).\n--But if this were so, the judgment as to difference would immediately follow\nfrom the judgment as to generic character, as soon as the latter is\napprehended! Quite true, we reply. As a matter of fact the judgment of\ndifference is immediately formulated on the basis of the judgment as to\ngeneric character. For 'the generic character' of a cow, e.g., means just the\nexclusion of everything else: as soon as that character is apprehended all\nthought and speech referring to other creatures belonging to the same wider\ngenus (which includes buffaloes and so on also) come to an end. It is through\nthe apprehension of difference only that the idea of non-difference comes to\nan end.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[44:1](sbe48014.htm#fr_9) Colour reveals itself as well as the thing that has\ncolour; knowledge reveals itself as well as the object known; so difference\nmanifests itself as well as the things that differ.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Plurality is not unreal](sbe48015.htm)\n\n"
