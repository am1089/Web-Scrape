Vyasa said :-- O King! Once on a time Haris\xc2\x92chandra went out to the\nforest on an hunting excursion; and, while roaming to and fro, he saw that a\nvery beautiful lady was crying. The King, seeing this, took pity on her and\nasked :-- \xc2\x93O Fair One! Why are you in this forest crying alone? O Large eyed\nOne! Has someone pained you? What is the cause of your sorrow? Express this\nquickly before me. Why have you come here in this dreadful lonely forest? What\nare the names of your husband and your father? O Beautiful One! In My kingdom,\nno demon can give any trouble to another\xc2\x92s lady; I will immediately kill him\nwho has given you this trouble. O thin-bellied One! Be comfortable; do not\nweep; tell me why you are in this sorrowful state; know that no sinner can\nremain within my territory.\xc2\x94 Hearing the words of the King, the lady wiped out\nher tears by her hand and began to say :--\n\n\n\n7-8. O King! I am Siddharupi _n_ i, of the nature of success; to get me,\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra is practising terrible austerities. So these troubles have arisen\nfrom him, the son of Kaus\xc2\x92ika. O King! For this reason I am sorry in Your\nkingdom. O One of good vows! I am a gentle lovely Lady; still that Muni is\ngiving me so much trouble.\n\n\n\n9-16. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Large-eyed One! No longer you will have to suffer\nany more pains. Be patient. I will go and make the Muni desist from his\ntapasya.\xc2\x94 Thus comforting the lady, the King went hurriedly to the Muni\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra and, bowing down to him said with clasped palms :-- O Mahar _s_ i!\nWhy are you ailing your body by this terrible severe austerity! O Highly\nintelligent One! For what great noble cause are you practising this hard\ntapasya; speak truly to me. O Son of Gadhi! I will fulfil your desires; there\nis no need of your practising this severe penance; please get out of it\nimmediately. O Mahar _s_ i! You know everything; so what shall I say anything\nfurther? See! It ought not anyone to practise this extremely dreadful tapasya,\ncausing troubles to the people within my territory. Thus prohibited by the\nKing Haris\xc2\x92chandra, the Muni became very angry at his heart and went towards\nhis own hermitage. The King, too, went back to his palace. The Muni on his\narrival at his hermitage, began to cogitate in his mind, \xc2\x93Why has the King\nunjustly desisted me from\n\n\n\np. 655\n\n\n\nmy tapasya\xc2\x94 and also the discussions that took place between him and Vas\xc2\x92i\n_st_ ha. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra became very angry at his heart and ready to take the\nvengeance of this. He thought over on many points and created a terrible demon\nof a dreadful appearance in the form of a boar and sent it to the territory of\nthe King Haris\xc2\x92chandra.\n\n\n\n17-28. That terrible boar, of huge body, entered into the kingdom, raising a\ndreadful sound. The guards became afraid at his terrible noise. Entering into\nthe forest, that boar began to whirl round and round and destroy the Malati\nforest, at another place the Kadamba forest, and at others the Yuthika forest.\nAt other places he began to dig up the earth by his tusks and root out the\nChampaka, Ketaki, Mallika and various other trees. At other places again, he\nrooted out nice gentle Us\xc2\x92ira, Karavira, Muchukunda, As\xc2\x92oka, Vakula, Tilaka\nand other trees and so massacred the nice gardens and forests. The forest\nguards, then, taking their weapons, rushed forward on that boar. Those that\nwere making garlands and the florists became very distressed and uttered\nuproars of consternation. That boar, as if an incarnate of Death, though\nrouted out with flights of arrows, could not be terrified; rather when he\nbegan to harass the guards very much, they became very much afraid and being\nvery distressed took the refuge of the King and, trembling, said :-- \xc2\x93O King!\nProtect us. Protect us.\xc2\x94 And they cried piteously. Seeing the guards terrified\nand distressed, the King asked them :-- Whom do you fear so much and why you\nare so distressed? Speak truly before me. O Guards! I do not fear the Deva nor\nthe Demons; so tell me who has created this panic amongst you. I, no doubt,\nwill send that vicious cheat unto the door of Death by this arrow, who has\ncome against me in this world. What sort of enemy is that? What is his form?\nWhat is his power and where is he residing now; speak this quickly to me. Be\nthat enemy a Deva or a Danava, I will slay him immediately by the multitude of\narrows.\n\n\n\n29-31. The Malakaras said :-- The enemy is not a Deva, nor a Danava, Yak _s_ a\nnor a Kinnara; it is a boar of a huge body that has entered into the forest.\nVery powerful, he is uprooting by his teeth all the beautiful flower trees; in\nfact, he is ruining all the gardens and forests. O King! We shot arrows on\nhim, struck him with cudgels and hurled stones at him so much; yet he did not\nget a bit afraid; rather he turned back to kill us.\n\n\n\n32-51. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing these words, the King\xc2\x92s fury knew no\nbounds and, immediately getting on horseback, he went towards the garden and\nforest. Then the horsemen, elephant drivers, charioteers and infantry, all\nfollowed him. When the King went there,\n\n\n\np. 656\n\n\n\nhe saw the terrible boar, of a huge body, whirling round and round and making\nthe peculiar sound in the forest; and he witnessed also the destroyed\ncondition of the forest and became very angry. He then drew his bow and arrows\nand fell down on him to take away his life. Seeing the King coming angrily\ntowards him with bow and arrows in his hands, the boar began to sound more\nterribly and ran forward before him. The King saw the boar coming towards him\nwith his mouth wide opened and began to shower arrows upon him to kill him.\nThe boar immediately made those arrows useless, and very violently and quickly\njumped and passed away, over the King. When the boar passed away, the King\nangrily drew his bow with great care and shot sharpened arrows at him. One\nmoment the boar came in the King\xc2\x92s sight; and at another moment he vanished\naway; thus the boar began to flee, uttering all sorts of sounds. The King\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra then became very angry and drawing his bow pursued him, mounting\non a horse, swift like the wind. The soldiers then entered the forest and\nscattered hither and thither; the King alone pursued the boar. The sun entered\nunto the meridian; and the King came to be alone in a lonely forest. His horse\nwas fatigued, and he, too, was tired of hunger and thirst. The boar went away\nout of sight. The King also missed his way in that dense jungle and became\ngreatly absorbed with intense cares and anxieties. He then began to think,\n\xc2\x93Where shall I now go? There is none to help me in this dense jungle.\nEspecially I don\xc2\x92t know the right path.\xc2\x94 While he was thus thinking, he saw,\nall on a sudden, a river with clear water in that lonely forest. He became\nmuch delighted to see the flowing river and, alighting from horseback, he\ndrank that water and made the horse also drink it. He became much relieved by\ndrinking; and though he was much bewildered not to find the right track, he\nwanted now to go to his own city. At this moment Vis\xc2\x92vamitra came up there in\nan old Brahmi _n_ form; the King also looking at him bowed down to the Brahmi\n_n_ garbed Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, who then spoke to the King :-- \xc2\x93O King! Welfare be\nunto you! What for have you come here? O King! What object have you got in\nview in this lonely forest? Be calm and quiet and speak everything before me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n52-58. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahmi _n_! One powerful boar of a huge body\nentered into my garden and spoilt altogether all the gentle flower trees\nthere. To desist that boar, I pursued him with bow in hand and went out of the\ncity. That powerful boar, very swift and, as it were, a magician, has escaped\nmy sight and gone away where I do not know. I pursued him and have come now to\nthis place and I do not know where my soldiers have gone. O Muni! Now I am\ndeprived of my men,\n\n\n\np. 657\n\n\n\nI am hungry and thirsty. I do not know which is the road to my city; nor do I\nknow where my soldiers have gone. O Dear Lord! It is to my great fortune that\nyou have come in this lonely forest. Now I want to return to my home; kindly\nshew me the way. I have completed my Rajasuya sacrifice. I always give\neveryone whatever he wants. This is known to everybody. O Dvija! If you want\nmoney for your sacrifice, then come with me to Ayodhya and I will give you\nabundance of wealth. I am Haris\xc2\x92chandra, the famous King of Ayodhya.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighteenth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the origin of the\nquarrel between Haris\xc2\x92chandra and Vis\xc2\x92vamitra in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad\nDevi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 19](bk07ch19.htm)\n\n"
