Griffith, [1899], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 297\n\n### BOOK THE THIRTY-EIGHTH.\n\nBY impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,  \nwith the Hands of Pushan.  \nA zone for Aditi art thou.  \n2 Ida, come hither. Aditi, come hither. Sarasvati, come  \nhither.  \nCome hither, So-and-So. Come hither, So-and-So. Come  \nhither, So-and-So.  \n3 Thou art a zone for Aditi, a diadem for Indrani. Pushan art  \nthou. Spare some for the Gharma.  \n4 Overflow for the Asvins. Overflow for Sarasvati. Overflow  \nfor Indra  \nAll-hail, what belongs to Indra! All-hail, what belongs to  \nIndra! All-hail, what belongs to Indra!  \n5 That breast of thine, exhaustless, fount of pleasure, wealth-giver,  \ntreasure-finder, free-bestower,  \nWherewith thou rearest all things that are choicest,\xc2\x97bring  \nthat, Sarasvati, that we may drain it.  \nThroughout the spacious middle air I travel.  \n6 Thou art Gayatra metre. Thou art Trishtup metre. With  \nHeaven and Earth I grasp thee. With the Firmament I  \nraise thee up.  \nIndra and Asvins, drink ye the hot draught of sweet honey:  \nsacrifice, ye Vasus. Vat! All-hail to the rain-winning  \nbeam of the Sun!\n\np. 298\n\n7 Thee with Svaha to Vata the sea. Thee with Svaha to Vata  \nthe flood.  \nThee with Svaha to Vata the unconquerable. Thee with  \nSvaha to Vata the irresistible.  \nThee with Svaha to Vata the protection-seeker. Thee with  \nSvaha to Vata the non-destructive.  \n8 Thee with Svaha to Indra Lord of Vasus. Thee with Svaha  \nto Indra Lord of Rudras.  \nThee with Svaha to Indra killer of foes. Thee with Svaha  \nto Savitar attended by Ribhu, Vibhu, and Vaja. Thee  \nwith Svaha to Brihaspati beloved of all the Gods.  \n9 Svaha to Yama attended by the Angirases, attended by the  \nFathers!  \nSvaha to the Gharma! The Gharma for the Father!  \n10 Here hath he worshipped, seated south, all the sky-regions,  \nall the Gods.  \nDrink, Asvins, of the heated draught, the Svaha-consecrated  \nmead.  \n11 In heaven lay thou this sacrifice; lay thou this sacrifice in  \nheaven.  \nTo sacrificial Agni hail! May bliss be ours from Yajus texts.  \n12 Drink, Asvins, with your daily helps, the Gharma, strengthener  \nof hearts.  \nTo him who draweth out the thread be homage, and to  \nHeaven and Earth.  \n13 The Gharma have the Asvins drunk: with Heaven and  \nEarth have they agreed.  \nHere, verily, be their boons bestowed.  \n14 Overflow for food. Overflow for energy. Overflow for the  \nPriesthood. Overflow for the Nobility. Overflow for  \nHeaven and Earth. Thou, O duteous one, art Duty.  \nInnocent one, in us establish manly powers; establish the  \nPeople.\n\np. 299\n\n15 All-hail to Pushan, to the milk's skin! All-hail to the  \npress-stones!  \nAll-hail to their echoes! All-hail to the Fathers who are  \nabove the grass, who drink the Gharma! All-hail to  \nHeaven and Earth! All-hail to the All-Gods!  \n16 All-hail to Rudra invoked by worshippers! All-hail! Let  \nlight combine with light.  \nMay Day together with his sheen, fair-lighted with his light,  \naccept. All hail!  \nMay Night together with her sheen, fair-lighted with her  \nlight, accept. All-hail!  \nMay we enjoy the mead offered in most Indra-like Agni.  \nHomage to thee, divine Gharma! Do not thou injure me.  \n17 Thy far-spread majesty, instinct with wisdom, hath  \nsurpassed this heaven,  \nAnd, with its glorious fame, the earth.  \nSeat thee, for thou art mighty: shine, best entertainer of  \nthe Gods.  \nWorthy of sacred food, praised Agni! loose the smoke ruddy  \nand beautiful to see.  \n18 Gharma, that heavenly light of thine in Gayatri, in the  \nSoma-store,\xc2\x97  \nMay it increase and be confirmed for thee, that light.  \nGharma, that light of thine in air, in Trishtup, in the sacred  \nhearth,\xc2\x97  \nMay it increase and be confirmed for thee, that light.  \nGharma, that light of thine on earth, in Jagati, of the priest's  \nshed,\xc2\x97  \nMay that increase and be confirmed for thee, that light.  \n19 Thee for the sure protection of the Nobles. Guard thou  \nfrom injury the Brahman's body.  \nWe follow thee in interest of the People, for the renewal of  \nour peace and comfort.\n\np. 300\n\n20 Square, far-spread is the sacrifice's navel: it spreads for us  \nwide, full of all existence, spreads wide for us full of  \ncomplete existence.  \nWe turn against the hate and guiles of him who keeps an  \nalien law.  \n21 This, Gharma! is thy liquid store. Swell out and wax in  \nstrength thereby.  \nMay we too grow in strength and wax to greatness.  \n22 Loudly the tawny Stallion neighed, mighty, like Mitra fair to see.  \nTogether with the Sun the sea, the store shone out with  \nflashing light.  \n23 To us let Waters and let Plants be friendly; to him who  \nhates us, whom we hate, unfriendly.  \n24 Looking upon the loftier light above the darkness we have come  \nTo Surya, God among the Gods, the light that is most excellent.  \n25 A brand art thou, fain would we thrive, Fuel art thou, and  \nsplendour: Give me splendour,  \n26 Far as the heaven and earth are spread in compass, far as  \nthe Seven Rivers are extended,  \nSo vast thy cup which I with strength am taking, Indra,  \nunharmed in me, uninjured ever.  \n27 In me be that great hero power, in me be strength and  \nmental force:  \nThe Gharma shines with triple light, with lustre fulgent  \nfar away, with holy lore, with brilliancy.  \n28 Brought hither is the seed of milk. Through each succeeding  \nyear may we enjoy the bliss of draining it.  \nInvited, I enjoy a share of that which hath been offered me,  \nthe savoury draught by Indra drunk and tasted by Prajapati.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XXXIX](wyvbk39.htm)\n\n"
