Suta said :-- On the king Pratipa, ascending to the Heavens, the truly\nhero-king S\xc2\x92antanu went out a hunting tigers and other forest animals. Once,\nwhile he was roaming in a wild wilderness, on the banks of the Ganges, he saw\na fawn-eyed well decorated beautiful woman. No sooner the king S\xc2\x92antanu saw\nher than he became addicted to her and thought within himself thus :--\n\xc2\x93Certainly my father spoke of this beautiful faced woman who is looking like a\nsecond Lak _s_ mi, endowed with beauty and youth.\xc2\x94 The king could not rest\nsatisfied simply with seeing the lotus-like face. The hairs on his body stood\non their ends and his heart was very much attracted to her. Ganga Devi, too,\nknew him to be the king Mahabhisa and became, in her turn, very much attached\nto him. She then went smiling towards the king. Seeing the blue-coloured lady\nlooking askance at him, the king became very happy and consoled her in sweet\nwords and said :-- \xc2\x93O, one of beautiful thighs! Are you Devi; Manusi (human\nkind) Gandharvi; Yakshi, the daughter of Nagas (serpents), or a celestial\nnymph? Whoever you may be, O beautiful one! be my wife; your sweet smiles, it\nseems, are brimful of love; so be my legal wife to-day.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9-26. Suta said :-- The king S\xc2\x92antanu could not recognise the lady to be\nGanga; but Ganga knew that he is the king Mahabhisa and is born as S\xc2\x92antanu.\nHearing the above words of the king, Ganga, out of her previous affections,\nspoke out to the king, smiling :-- \xc2\x93O king! I know that you are the son of the\nking Pratipa. Behold! Though it is inevitable that woman will get their\nhusbands, yet who is that beautiful lady that does not husband according to\nher liking and qualifications? But I can take you as my husband, if you make a\ncertain promise to me. Hear my resolve afterwards I will marry you. O king!\nWhatever I will do, be it good or bad, auspicious or inauspicious, you must\nnot hinder or interrupt me\n\n\n\np. 88\n\n\n\nnor ever say that is not to your liking and satisfaction. Whenever you will\nbreak this my resolve, I will instantly quit you and go to another place\nwherever I like. The king S\xc2\x92antanu, then, said :-- \xc2\x93Well! That will be\xc2\x94 and\npromised to the above effect; then Ganga Devi recollected within herself\nVasus' words and thought of the attachment of the king Mahabhisa and accepted\nS\xc2\x92antanu as her husband. Thus married to the king S\xc2\x92antanu, the beautiful\nGanga in human form went to his abode. The king, on having got possession of\nher, began to enjoy in pleasant gardens. The lady, too, appreciated his mental\nfeelings and began to serve him to his satisfaction. Thus many years elapsed\nin lovely enjoyments and intercourses between the couple who looked like Indra\nand his pair Sachi; and they did not feel at all how the time passed. The lady\nendowed with all qualities and the clever king, well-versed in the art of\nloving, began to enjoy incessantly like Laksmi and Narayana, in their divine\npalace.\n\n\n\nThus many years passed when the lovely eyed lady became pregnant of the king\nS\xc2\x92antanu's sperm and, in due time, gave birth to a son who was a Vasu. No\nsooner the son was born than Ganga Devi threw it in the waters of the Ganges.\nThus the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh sons were threwn\nsuccessively on the waters. Then the king became very anxious and thought\nwithin himself :-- \xc2\x93What am I to do now? How my family be preserved? This my\nwife, incarnate of sin, has killed my seven sons; if I now desist her, she\nwill instantly leave me and go away. Now this is the eighth pregnancy as\ndesired by me. Now if I do not interrupt her, she will certainly throw my son\nin the Ganges. Whether a son will be born again or not is doubtful; and even\nif that be born, it is doubtful whether she will preserve that child; now what\nam I to do in this doubtful point? However I will try my best to continue the\nthread of my family line.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n27-46. Now, in due time, the Vasu who, having been influenced by his wife had\nstolen Vas\xc2\x92istha's cow Nandini, became born as the eighth son of Ganga Devi;\nthe king S\xc2\x92antanu, seeing this son fell unto Ganga's feet and said :-- \xc2\x93O\nthin-bodied woman! I pray to you to give my life to-day; better nourish this\nmy one son. O beautiful one! You killed in succession my seven exceedingly\nbeautiful sons. O one of beautiful hips! I now fall at your feet. O beautiful\none! save the life of this child of mine. If you ask from me any other thing\nto day, even that be very rare, I will give it to you; but you better now keep\nthe thread of my family line. The Pundits, versed in the Vedas, say that he\nwho has no issues cannot go to Heaven; so, O Beautiful one! To-day I pray to\nyou to keep the life of this my eighth son.\xc2\x94 Though thus spoken by S\xc2\x92antanu,\n\n\n\np. 89\n\n\n\nGanga Devi was eager to take away the son to throw in the waters; the king\nbecame very sorrowful and angrily spoke out \xc2\x93O vile and vicious woman! What\nare you going to do? Do you not fear hell! of what villain are you the\ndaughter, that you are always doing this vicious deed? O Sinner! go away\nwherever you will or remain here as yon like, it matters little; but my son\nwill remain here. When you attempt to bring my family to extinction, what use\nis there in living with you?\xc2\x94 When the king thus spoke to the woman who was\nready to take away the son she angrily spoke as follows :-- O King! When you\nhave acted against my promise, my word is broken and my connection with you\nhas stopped from to-day. Therefore I will take this son to the forest, where I\nwill nourish him. I am Ganga; to fulfil God's work I have come here. The high-\nsouled Vas'i _st_ ha cursed before the eight Vasus :-- \xc2\x93Better be born as\nmen\xc2\x94; they became very anxious; and seeing me they prayed :-- \xc2\x93O Sinless one!\nlet you be mother of us all.\xc2\x94 O best of kings! I granted them what they\ndesired; and then for the purpose of serving god's ends, I became your wife.\nKnow this my history. The seven Vasus already were born and were freed; now\nthis is the last Vasu and he will remain here for sometime as your son. O\nS\xc2\x92antanu! now take this son offered by Ganga. Know this to be the Deva Vasu\nand enjoy the pleasure of having a son. O highly fortunate one! This son will\nbe famous by the name of Gangeya (Ganga's son) and will be the most powerful\nof all. O King! To-day I will take this son to the place where I chose you as\nmy husband; I will nourish him and when he attains his youth, I will return\nhim to you. For, this son, if deprived of mother, will not be happy nor will\nhe live.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, Ganga vanished with the son; the King S\xc2\x92antanu became\nvery sorrowful and passed away his time in his palace. The king thought always\nof the separation from his wife and son and thus painfully governed his\nkingdom.\n\n\n\n47-69. Thus some time passed on, when, once on an occasion, the king S\xc2\x92antanu\nwent out a hunting and killed, with arrows, buffaloes, boar, and other wild\nanimals and came to the banks of the Ganges. Here he saw with great wonder\nthat a boy was playing with a great bow and was shooting arrows after arrows.\nThe king's attention was more attracted towards the boy, but whether that boy\nwas his or not, did not at all come to his mind. Looking at his extraordinary\nfeats, his agility in shooting arrows with ease and quickness, his learning\nthat can have no equal and his beautiful form, as if of Cupid, he became\ngreatly surprised and asked him :-- \xc2\x93O Sinless one! whose son are you?\xc2\x94 The\nhero boy did not reply anything but went away shooting his arrows. The king\nthought within himself \xc2\x93Who is this boy? Whose son is he? What to do now? To\nwhom\n\n\n\np. 90\n\n\n\nshall I go now?\xc2\x94 Thus pondering, he recollected within himself and began to\nrecite verses in praise of Ganga; Ganga, assuming her beautiful form as\nbefore, became visible to the king. Seeing her, the king said :-- \xc2\x93O Ganga!\nWho is this boy that has just gone? Will you show him once more to me now?\xc2\x94\nHearing these words of S\xc2\x92antanu, Ganga said :-- \xc2\x93O king of kings! He is your\nson, he is that eighth Vasu. So long I have nourished him and now I hand him\nover to you. O Suvrata! This is the great ascetic Gangeya. He is the\nillustrious scion of your family. The glory of your line will be enhanced. I\nhave taught him the whole science of archery. This pure son of yours dwelt in\nthe hermitage of Vas'i _st_ ha and has become versed in all the Vidyas and\nskilled in all the actions. Your this son knows everything that Jamadgni\nParas'uram knew. So, O king of kings! Take now your son and be happy. Thus\nsaying, Ganga gave him his son and vanished; the king also became very glad\nand embraced his son; he smelled his head and took him to his chariot and\ndrove towards his own city. On returning to Hastinapur, the king held a great\nfestival (utsab) in honor of the arrival of his son; he called all his\nastrologers and enquired what day was auspicious. He then called all his\nsubjects and ministers and installed Gangeya as the Crown Prince. The\nreligious S\xc2\x92antanu became very happy on making Gangeya, the Crown Prince; he\nforgot the pains due to Ganga's bereavement. Suta said :-- \xc2\x93Thus I have\ndescribed to you the cause of the curse on Vasus, the birth of Bhisma from the\nwomb of Ganga, the union of Ganga and S\xc2\x92antanu, etc., He who hears in this\nworld this holy story of Ganga's birth and the birth of the Vasu, is freed of\nall sins and gets mukti. O Munis! I have described these meritorious holy\naccounts, as I heard from the mouth of Vyasa. Any body who hears this holy\nS\xc2\x92rimad Bhagavatam, endowed with five characteristics and filled with various\nanecdotes, that came out of the mouth of Vyasa, finds all his sins destroyed\nand attains peace and blessedness. O Munis! Thus has been described completely\nto you this holy history.\n\n\n\nThus ends the fourth Chapter on the birth of the Vasus in the Mahapurana\nS\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk02ch05.htm)\n\n"
