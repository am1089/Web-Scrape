He who has killed a Kshatriya shall give a thousand cows (to Brahma _n_\nas) for the expiation of his sin. 1\n\np. 79\n\n2\\. (He shall give) a hundred cows for a Vai _s_ ya, 2\n\n3\\. Ten for a _S_ udra, 3\n\n4\\. And in every one (of these cases) one bull (must be given) in excess (of\nthe number of cows) for the sake of expiation.\n\n5\\. And if women of the (three castes mentioned have been slain) the same\n(composition must be paid).\n\n6\\. He who has slain a man belonging to the two (first-mentioned castes) who\nhas studied the Veda, or had been initiated for the performance of a Soma-\nsacrifice, becomes an Abhi _s_ asta. 6\n\n7\\. And (he is called an Abhi _s_ asta) who has slain a man belonging merely\nto the Brahma _n_ a caste (though he has not studied the Veda or been\ninitiated for a Soma-sacrifice),\n\np. 80\n\n8\\. Likewise he who has destroyed an embryo of a (Brahma _n_ a, even though\nits sex be) undistinguishable,\n\n9\\. Or a woman (of the Brahma _n_ a caste) during her courses. 9\n\n10\\. (Now follows) the penance for him (who is an Abhi _s_ asta).\n\n11\\. He (himself) shall erect a hut in the forest, restrain his speech, carry\n(on his stick) the skull (of the person slain) like a flag, and cover the\nspace from his navel to his knees with a quarter of a piece of hempen cloth.\n11\n\n12\\. The path for him when he goes to a village, is the space between the\ntracks (of the wheels).\n\n13\\. And if he sees another (\xc3\x82rya), he shall step out of the road (to the\ndistance of two yards).\n\n14\\. He shall go to the village, carrying a broken tray of metal of an\ninferior quality.\n\n15\\. He may go to seven houses only, (crying,) \'Who will give alms to an Abhi\n_s_ asta?\'\n\n16\\. That is (the way in which he must gain) his livelihood.\n\n17\\. If he does not obtain anything (at the seven houses), he must fast.\n\n18\\. And (whilst performing this penance) he must tend cows.\n\n19\\. When they leave and enter the village, that is the second occasion (on\nwhich he may enter) the village.\n\np. 81\n\n20\\. After having performed (this penance) for twelve years, he must perform)\nthe ceremony known (by custom), through which he is re-admitted into the\nsociety of the good. 20\n\n21\\. Or (after having performed the twelve years\' penance), he may build a hut\non the path of robbers, and live there, trying to take from them the cows of\nBrahma _n_ as. He is free (from his sin), when thrice he has been defeated by\nthem, or when he has vanquished them. 21\n\n22\\. Or he is freed (from his sin), if (after the twelve years\' penance) he\nbathes (with the priests) at the end of a horse-sacrifice. 22\n\n23\\. This very same (penance is ordained) for him who, when his duty and love\nof gain come into conflict, chooses the gain. 23\n\n24\\. If he has slain a Guru or a Brahma _n_ a, who has studied the Veda and\nfinished the ceremonies of a Soma-sacrifice, he shall live according to this\nvery same rule until his last breath. 24\n\n25\\. He cannot be purified in this life. But his sin is removed (after death).\n25\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[78:1](sbe0227.htm#fr_454) **24**. Manu XI, 128; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 266. Others\nexplain the phrase vairayatanartham, \'for the expiation of his sin,\' thus:\n\'He, who is p. 79 slain by anybody, becomes, in dying, an enemy of his slayer\n(and thinks), "O that I might slay him in another life," for the removal of\nthis enmity!\'--Haradatta. I am strongly inclined to agree with the other\ncommentator, and to translate vairayatanartham, \'in order to remove the\nenmity.\' I recognise in this fine a remnant of the law permitting compositions\nfor murder which was in force in ancient Greece and among the Teutonic\nnations. With the explanation adopted by Haradatta, it is impossible to find a\nreasonable interpretation for praya _s_ _k_ ittirtha _h_ , Sutra 4. Haradatta,\nseduced by the parallel passage of Manu, takes it to be identical with\nvairayatanartham. I propose to translate our Sutra thus: \'He who has killed a\nKshatriya shall give a thousand cows (to the relations of the murdered man) in\norder to remove the enmity.\' According to Baudhayana I, 10. 19. 1 (compare\nZeitschr. d. D. Morg. Ges., vol. 41, pp. 672-76; Festgruss an Roth, pp.\n44-52), the cows are to be given to the king.\n\n[79:2](sbe0227.htm#fr_455) Manu XI, 130. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 267.\n\n[79:3](sbe0227.htm#fr_456) Manu XI, 131. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 267.\n\n[79:6](sbe0227.htm#fr_457) Manu XI, 87. Abhi _s_ asta means literally\n\'accused, accursed,\' and corresponds in \xc3\x82pastamba\'s terminology to the\nmahapatakin of Manu and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, instead of which latter word Manu\nuses it occasionally, e.g. II, 185.\n\n[80:9](sbe0227.htm#fr_458) \'Others interpret atreyi, "during her courses," by\n"belonging to the race of Atri."\'--Haradatta.\n\n[80:11](sbe0227.htm#fr_459) Others say that he may carry the skull of any\ncorpse. This Sutra is to be construed with Sutra 14, Sutras 12 and 13 being\ninserted parenthetically.--Haradatta. Manu XI, 72-78; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 243.\n\n[81:20](sbe0227.htm#fr_460) \'I.e. after having performed the penance, he shall\ntake grass and offer it to a cow. If the cow approaches and confidingly eats,\nthen one should know that he has performed the penance properly not\notherwise.\'--Haradatta. Manu XI, 195 and 196.\n\n[81:21](sbe0227.htm#fr_461) Manu XI, 81.--Thus Haradatta, better, \'when-thrice\nhe has fought with them,\' see the Pet. Dict. s. v. radh.\n\n[81:22](sbe0227.htm#fr_462) Manu XI, 83; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 67.\n\n[81:23](sbe0227.htm#fr_463) \'Or the Sutra may have reference to unrighteous\ngain acquired by false testimony and the like.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[81:24](sbe0227.htm#fr_464) \'Guru means "the father and the rest."--Haradatta.\n\n[81:25](sbe0227.htm#fr_465) \'His sin is removed after death. Hence the meaning\nis that his sons or other (relations) may perform the funeral ceremonies and\nthe like. But others think that the first part of the Sutra forbids this, and\nthat the meaning of pratvapatti _h_ (can be p. 82 purified) is "connection by\nbeing received as a son or other relation."--Haradatta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 9, Kha _n_ _d_ a 25](sbe0228.htm)\n\n'
