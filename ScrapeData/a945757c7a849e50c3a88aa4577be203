Suta said :-- Glad to hear the excellent divine stories of the Solar and\nLunar races, the virtuous King Janamejaya, the son of Parik _s_ it, again\nasked :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! I am now very eager to hear the increase of the two lines\nof Kings. O Sinless One! You know everything. So kindly describe, in detail,\nthe pure histories, capable to destroy sins, of the kings and their\ncharacters. The kings of the Lunar and the Solar races were great Bhaktas of\nthe Highest S'akti, S'ri Bhagavati Devi; this I have heard. O Muni! Who wants\nnot to hear further on the glorious anecdotes of the Bhaktas of the S'ri\nDevi?\xc2\x94 When the Rajar _s_ i asked thus, the Muni Kri _sn_ a Dvaipayan, the son\nof Satyavati began to narrate gladly the several deeds of the Kings.\n\n\n\n6-13. O King! I am now narrating to you in detail the origin, etc., of the\nLunar and the Solar dynasties as well as of other kings in their connection.\nHear attentively. The four-faced Brahma sprang from the navel of Vi _sn_ u;\nengaged in practising Tapasya, he began to worship the Maha Devi Durga,\nextremely hard to conceive. Maha Devi, pleased at his worship, granted boon to\nBrahma; Brahma, the Grandsire of all the Lokas on thus getting the boon,\nbecame ready to create the world; but he could not create all on a sudden the\nhuman beings. Though the creation was eternally fashioned by the Pramatma\nBhagavati, the four-faced Brahma thinking over in his mind variously, could\nnot quickly spread it out and accomplish it as a veritable fact. Therefore He,\nthe Prajapati, first created mentally the seven mind-born sons. These were\nknown by the names of Marichi, Atri, Angira, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and\nVais'i _st_ ha. Next sprang Rudra from the anger of Prajapati, Narada from his\nlap; Dak _s_ a from his right thumb. Thus Sanaka and the other Ri _s_ is were\nalso his mind-born sons. O King! The wife of Dak _s_ a was born from the left\nthumb of Prajapati; this all-beautiful daughter is well known in all the Pura\n_n_ as by the name of Viri _n_ i and Asikni. Narada, the chief of the Devar\n_s_ is, was born, on some other occasion in her womb.\n\n\n\n14-17. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_! A great doubt arises in me to hear\nthat the great ascetic Narada was born of Dak _s_ a in the womb of Viri _n_ i.\nThe Muni Narada indeed, was the son of Brahma; moreover be was the foremost of\nthe ascetics and especially endowed with the\n\n\n\np. 597\n\n\n\nknowledge of Dharma; how, then, can he be born of the womb of the Daksha's\nwife Viri _n_ i. Well, if that be so, then describe, in detail, that wonderful\nstory of the birth of Narada in the womb of Viri _n_ i.\n\n\n\n18-31. O Muni! Under whose curse, the high-souled Narada though very wise, had\nto leave his first body and be born again.\xc2\x94 Vyasa said :-- O King, Brahma, the\nSelf-born, with a view to create offspring, ordered first Dak _s_ a :-- \xc2\x93Go\nand multiply innumerable children for the increase of the world.\xc2\x94 Thus ordered\nby his father the Prajapati Dak _s_ a produced five thousand powerful and\nheroic sons in the womb of Viri _n_ i. Seeing all the sons of Dak _s_ a,\ndesirous to multiply, the Devar _s_ i Narada urged on, as it were, by Fate,\nbegan to laugh at them. How do you desire to multiply when you know not the\ndimensions and capacity of earth; so you will, no doubt, be put to ridicule\nand laughter. Rather, if you proceed on work, knowing beforehand the earth's\ncapacity, your efforts will be fruitful. Otherwise, your attempt will no\ndoubt, end in failures. Alas! You are awfully illiterate! Not knowing the\ndimensions of the world, you are ready to multiply your progeny; how, then,\ncan you meet with success! Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing, all on a sudden,\nthese words, Haryas'va and other sons began to speak with each other, \xc2\x93What\nthis Muni has told, is very true. Let us then ascertain the earth's\ndimensions; we can easily multiply afterwards.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, they all went out\nto reconnoitre the earth. Thus excited at Narada's words, some went eastward,\nsome southwards, some towards the north and some went to west all\nsimultaneously and, as they liked, to make a survey of the earth. When the\nsons went away, Dak _s_ a became exceedingly sorry on their absence. Bent\nagain on multiplying, he begat other sons; those sons again wanted to\nprocreate. Seeing them, Narada again laughed and said :--Alas! What fools are\nyou! Not knowing the dimensions of the earth, why are you ready to procreate?\nThey were deluded by Narada's words, took them as true, and went out as their\nelder brothers did. Not being able to see those sons, Prajapati Dak _s_ a\nbecame very sorrowful for them and cursed Narada in rage.\n\n\n\n32-38. Dak _s_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Evil-minded One! You have destroyed my sons; so\nbe yourself destroyed; you will have to be born in the womb for your sin in\ncausing the death of my sons; you have caused my sons to go abroad; so you\nmust be born as my son.\xc2\x94 Thus cursed by Dak _s_ a, Narada had to take his\nbirth in the womb of Viri _n_ i. I heard also that the Prajapati Dak _s_ a\nbegat afterwards sixty daughters in her womb. O King! Dak _s_ a, the great\nknower of Dharma, then gave up the sorrows for his sons and married his\nthirteen daughters to the high-souled Kas'yapa,\n\n\n\np. 598\n\n\n\nten daughters to Dharma, twenty-seven daughters to the Moon, two to Bhrigu,\nfour to Ari _st_ anemi, two to Kris'as'va and the remaining two to Angira.\nTheir sons and grandsons, the Devas and Danavas, became powerful but\nantagonistic towards each other. All of them were heroes and very Mayavis; so,\ndeluded by their greed and jealousy, they quarrelled amongst each other.\n\n\n\nHere ends the First Chapter in the Seventh Book on the beginning of the\nnarrative of the Solar and the Lunar lines of kings in the Maha Pura _n_ am\nS'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk07ch02.htm)\n\n"
