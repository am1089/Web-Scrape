They answer, "Come to the edge of the\nearth, lift up your hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the\nclouds."\n\n"My mother is waiting for me at home," I say. "How can I leave her and come?"\n\nThen they smile and float away.\n\nBut I know a nicer game than that, mother.\n\nI shall be the cloud and you the moon.\n\nI shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will be the blue sky.\n\nThe folk who live in the waves call out to me--\n\n"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know not where we\npass."\n\nI ask, "But, how am I to join you?" They tell me, "Come to the edge of the\nshore and stand with your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon\nthe waves."\n\nI say, "My mother always wants me at home in the evening--how can I leave her\nand go?"\n\nThen they smile, dance and pass by.\n\nBut I know a better game than that.\n\nI will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.\n\nI shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with laughter.\n\nAnd no one in the world will know where we both are.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Champa Flower](cm17.htm)\n\n'
