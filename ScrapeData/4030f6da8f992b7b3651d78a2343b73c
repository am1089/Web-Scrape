And as he walked along,\nthe goblin on his shoulder spoke and said: "O King, listen once more to the\nfollowing story to beguile your weariness."\n\n\n\nIn the Anga country there is a great region called Forest. There lived a great\nBrahman, pious and wealthy, whose name was Vishnu-swami. To his worthy wife\nthree sons were born, one after another. When they had grown to be young men,\nspecialists in matters of luxury, they were sent one day by their father to\nfind a turtle for a sacrifice which he had begun.\n\nSo the brothers went to the ocean and there they found a turtle. Then the\neldest said to the two younger: "One of you take this turtle for Father\'s\nsacrifice. I cannot carry a slimy thing that smells raw."\n\nBut when the eldest said this, the two younger said: "Sir, if you feel\ndisgust, why shouldn\'t we?"\n\nWhen the eldest heard this, he said: "You take the turtle, otherwise Father\'s\nsacrifice will be ruined on your account. Then you and Father too will surely\ngo to hell."\n\nWhen they heard him, the two younger brothers laughed and said: "Sir, you seem\nto know our common duty, but not your own."\n\nThen the eldest said: "What? Are you not aware that I am a connoisseur in\nfood? For I am a specialists in foods. How can I touch this loathsome thing?"\n\nWhen he heard these words, the second brother said: "But I am even more of a\nconnoisseur. I am a specialist in women. So how can I touch it?"\n\nAfter this speech, the eldest said to the youngest: "Do you then, being\nyounger than we, carry the turtle."\n\nThen the youngest frowned and said to them: "Fools! I am a great specialist in\ncotton."\n\nSo the three brothers quarrelled, and arrogantly leaving the turtle behind\nthem, they went to have the matter decided at Pinnacle, the capital of a king\ncalled Conqueror. When they came there, and had been announced and introduced\nby the door-keeper, they told their story to the king. And when the king had\nheard all, he said: "Stay here. I will examine you one after another." So they\nagreed and all stayed there.\n\nThen the king invited them in at his own dinner hour, seated them on\nmagnificent seats, and set before them sweet dishes of six flavours, fit for a\nking. While all the rest ate, one of the Brahmans, the specialist in food,\ndisgustedly shook his head and refused to eat. And when the king himself asked\nhim why he would not eat food that was sweet and savoury, he respectfully\nreplied: "Your Majesty, in this food there is the odour of smoke from a\nburning corpse. Therefore, I do not wish to eat it, however sweet it may be."\n\nThen at the king\'s command all the rest smelt of it and declared it the best\nof winter rice, and perfectly sweet. But the food-critic held his nose and\nwould not touch it. Now when the king reflected and made a careful\ninvestigation, he learned from the commissioners that the dish was made of\nrice grown near a village crematory. Then he was greatly astonished and\npleased, and said: "Brahman, you are certainly a judge of food. Pray take\nsomething else."\n\nAfter dinner the king dismissed them to their rooms, and sent for the most\nbeautiful woman of his court. And at night he sent this lovely creature, all\nadorned, to the second brother, the specialist in women. She came with a\nservant of the king to his chamber, and when she entered, she seemed to\nilluminate the room. But the judge of women almost fainted, and stopping his\nnose with his left hand, he said to his servants: "Take her away! If not, I\nshall die. A goaty smell issues from her."\n\nSo the servants, in distress and astonishment, conducted her to the king and\ntold him what had happened. Then the king sent for the specialist in women,\nand said: "Brahman, she has anointed herself with sandal, camphor, and aloes,\nso that a delightful perfume pervades her neighbourhood. How could this woman\nhave a goaty smell?" But in spite of this the specialist in women would not\nyield. And when the king endeavoured to learn the truth, he heard from her own\nlips that in her infancy she had been separated from her mother and had been\nbrought up on goat\'s milk. Then the king was greatly astonished and loudly\npraised the critical judgment of the specialist in women.\n\nQuickly he had a couch prepared for the third brother, the specialist in\ncotton. So the critic of cotton went to sleep on a bed with seven quilts over\nthe frame and covered with a pure, soft coverlet. When only a half of the\nfirst watch of the night was gone, he suddenly started from the bed, shouting\nand writhing with pain, his hand pressed to his side. And the king\'s men who\nwere stationed there saw the curly red outline of a hair deeply imprinted on\nhis side.\n\nThey went at once and informed the king, who said to them: "See whether there\nis anything under the quilts or not." So they went and searched under each\nquilt, and under the last they found one hair, which they immediately took and\nshowed to the king. And the king summoned the specialist in cotton, and\nfinding the mark exactly corresponding to the hair, was filled with extreme\nastonishment. And he spent that night wondering how the hair could sink into\nhis body through seven quilts.\n\nNow when the king arose in the morning, he was delighted with their marvellous\ncritical judgment and sensitiveness, so that he gave each of the three\nspecialists a hundred thousand gold-pieces. And they were contented and stayed\nthere, forgetting all about the turtle, and thus incurring a crime through the\nfailure of their father\'s sacrifice.\n\n\n\nWhen he had told this remarkable story, the goblin on the king\'s shoulder\nsaid: "O King, remember the curse I spoke of and declare which of these three\nwas the cleverest."\n\nWhen he heard this, the wise king answered the goblin: "Without doubt I regard\nthe specialist in cotton as the cleverest, on whose body the imprint of the\nhair was seen to appear visibly. The other two might possibly have found out\nbeforehand."\n\nWhen the king had said this, the goblin slipped from his shoulder as before.\nAnd the king went back under the sissoo tree again to fetch him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Ninth Goblin: The Four Scientific Suitors.
