 \nAll needful things with haste prepare  \nThat Rama be appointed heir.'  \n\nThen burst the people's rapture out  \nIn loud acclaim and joyful shout;  \nAnd when the tumult slowly ceased  \nThe king addressed the holy priest:  \n'Give order, Saint, with watchful heed  \nFor what the coming rite will need.  \nThis day let all things ready wait  \nMine eldest son to consecrate.'  \nBest of all men of second birth  \nVas'ishtha heard the lord of earth,  \nAnd gave commandment to the bands  \nOf servitors with lifted hands  \nWho waited on their master's eye:  \n'Now by to-morrow's dawn supply  \nRich gold and herbs and gems of price  \nAnd offerings for the sacrifice,  \nWreaths of white flowers and roasted rice.  \nAnd oil and honey, separate;  \nNew garments and a car of state,  \nAn elephant with lucky signs,  \nA fourfold host in ordered lines,  \nThe white umbrella, and a pair  \nOf chowries,  1 and a banner fair;  \nA hundred vases, row on row,  \nTo shine like fire in splendid glow,  \nA tiger's mighty skin, a bull  \nWith gilded horns most beautiful.  \nAll these, at dawn of coming day,  \nAround the royal shrine array,  \nWhere burns the fire's undying ray.  \nEach palace door, each city gate  \nWith wreaths of sandal decorate.  \nAnd with the garlands' fragrant scent  \nLet clouds of incense-smoke be blent.  \nLet food of noble kind and taste  \nBe for a hundred thousand placed;  \nFresh curds with streams of milk bedewed  \nTo feed the Brahman multitude.  \n\np. 92  \n\nWith care be all their wants supplied.  \nAnd mid the twice-born chiefs divide  \nRich largess, with the early morn,  \nAnd oil and curds and roasted corn.  \nSoon as the sun has shown his light  \nPronounce the prayer to bless the rite,  \nAnd then be all the Brahmans called  \nAnd in their ordered seats installed.  \nLet all musicians skilled to play,  \nAnd dancing-girls in bright array  \nStand ready in the second ring  \nWithin the palace of the king.  \nEach honoured tree, each holy shrine  \nWith leaves and flowery wreaths entwine,  \nAnd here and there beneath the shade  \nBe food prepared and presents laid.  \nThen brightly clad, in warlike guise,  \nWith long swords girt upon their thighs,  \nLet soldiers of the nobler sort  \nMarch to the monarch's splendid court.'  \n\nThus gave command the twice-born pair  \nTo active servants stationed there.  \nThen hastened to the king and said  \nThat all their task was duly sped,  \nThe king to wise Sumantra spake:  \n'Now quick, my lord, thy chariot take,  \nAnd hither with thy swiftest speed  \nMy son, my noble Rama lead.'  \n\nSumantra, ere the word was given,  \nHis chariot from the court had driven,  \nAnd Rama, best of all who ride  \nIn cars, came sitting by his side.  \nThe lords of men had hastened forth  \nFrom east and west and south and north,  \n\xc3\x81ryan and stranger, those who dwell  \nIn the wild wood and on the fell,  \nAnd as the Gods to Indra, they  \nShowed honour to the king that day.  \n\nLike Vasav, when his glorious form  \nIs circled by the Gods of storm,  \nGirt in his hall by kings he saw  \nHis car-borne Rama near him draw,  \nLike him who rules the minstrel band  \nOf heaven;  1 whose valour tilled the land,  \nOf mighty arm and stately pride  \nLike a wild elephant in stride,  \nAs fair in face as that fair stone  \nDear to the moon, of moonbeams grown,  2  \nWith noble gifts and grace that took  \nThe hearts of all, and chained each look,  \nWorld-cheering as the Lord of Rain  \nWhen floods relieve the parching plain.  \nThe father, as the son came nigh,  \nGazed with an ever-thirstier eye.  \nSumantra helped the prince alight  \n\nFrom the good chariot passing bright,  \nAnd as to meet his sire he went  \nFollowed behind him reverent.  \nThen Rama clomb, the king to seek  \nThat terrace like Kailasa's peak,  \nAnd reached the presence of the king,  \nSumantra closely following.  \nBefore his father's face he came,  \nRaised suppliant hands and named his name,  1b  \nAnd bowing lowly as is meet  \nPaid reverence to the monarch's feet.  \nBut soon as Das'aratha viewed  \nThe prince in humble attitude,  \nHe raised him by the hand in haste  \nAnd his beloved son embraced,  \nThen signed him to a glorious throne,  \nGem-decked and golden, near his own.  \nThen Rama, best of Raghu's line,  \nMade the fair seat with lustre shine  \nAs when the orient sun upsprings  \nAnd his pure beam on Meru flings.  \nThe glory flashed on roof and wall,  \nAnd with strange sheen suffused the hall,  \nAs when the moon's pure rays are sent  \nThrough autumn's star-lit firmament.  \nThen swelled his breast with joy and pride  \nAs his dear son the father eyed,  \nE'en as himeself more fair arrayed  \nIn some clear mirror's face displayed.  \nThe aged monarch gazed awhile,  \nThen thus addressed him with a smile,  \nAs Kas'yap, whom the worlds revere,  \nSpeaks for the Lord of Gods to hear:  \n'O thou of all my sons most dear,  \nIn virtue best, thy father's peer,  \nChild of my consort first in place,  \nMine equal in her pride of race,  \nBecause the people's hearts are bound  \nTo thee by graces in thee found,  \nBe thou in Pushya's favouring hour  \nMade partner of my royal power.  \nI know that thou by nature's bent  \nBoth modest art and excellent,  \nBut though thy gifts no counsel need  \nMy love suggests the friendly rede.  \nMine own dear son, be modest still,  \nAnd rule each sense with earnest will.  \nKeep thou the evils far away  \nThat spring from love and anger's sway.  \nThy noble course alike pursue  \nIn secret as in open view,  \nAnd every nerve, the love to gain  \nOf ministers and subjects, strain.  \nThe happy prince who sees with pride  \nHis thriving people satisfied;  \nWhose arsenals with arms are stored,  \nAnd treasury with golden hoard,--  \n\np. 93  \n\nHis friends rejoice as joyed the Blest  \nWhen Amrit crowned their eager quest.  \nSo well, my child, thy course maintain,  \nAnd from all ill thy soul refrain.'  \n\nThe friends of Rama, gathered nigh,  \nLonging their lord to gratify,  \nRan to Kaus'alya's bower to tell  \nThe tidings that would please her well.  \nShe, host of dames, with many a gem,  \nAnd gold, and kine rewarded them.  \n\nThen Rama paid the reverence due,  \nMounted the chariot, and withdrew,  \nAnd to his splendid dwelling drove  \nWhile crowds to show him honour strove.  \n   The people, when the monarch's speech  \n     Their willing ears had heard,  \n   Were wild with joy as though on each  \n     Great gifts had been conferred.  \n   With meek and low salute each man  \n     Turned to his home away,  \n   And there with happy heart began  \n     To all the Gods to pray.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[91:1](ry081.htm#fr_261) Whisks, usually made of the long tails of the Yak.\n\n[92:1](ry081.htm#fr_262) Chitraratha, King of the Gandharvas.\n\n[92:2](ry081.htm#fr_263) The Chandrakanta or Moonstone, a sort of crystal\nsupposed to be composed of congealed moonbeams.\n\n[92:1b](ry081.htm#fr_264) A customary mark of respect to a superior.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto IV.: Rama Summoned.](ry082.htm)\n\n"
