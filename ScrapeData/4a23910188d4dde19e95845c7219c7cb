CONTROL OF THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM\n\nTo attain a condition in which the fullest relaxation is possible, it is\nessential to control the brain and the nervous system. In old Sanskrit tracts\nwe find the statement: "When the nervous system is relieved of all its\nimpurities, there appears the perceptible signs of success ... the glowing\ncolor of health."\n\nWhile speaking of the "brain," we must, to some extent, drop the Western\ntraditional concept of the brain as the sole seat of consciousness. As far\nback as 2,500 years ago, the Yogins were in conflict with the accepted Hindu\nmedical science of the time. These ancient medical men held, as did the\nancient Greeks, that the heart was the seat of consciousness. The Yogins, on\nthe other hand, stated that the brain, with its highly involved nervous\nsystem, was one unit which represented the true physical medium of human\nmental activity. There is an interwoven cerebro-spinal system and an autonomic\nnervous system. In the Yoga system of histology, the cerebro-spinal system is\nsaid to consist of the _sahasradala_ , the brain, and the _susumna_ , the\nspinal cord, which are enclosed within the cavities of the cranium and the\nspinal cord\n\np. 9\n\nor vertebrae. Linked together in the autonomic nervous system is a double\nchain of ganglia which are situated on each side of the spine and which extend\nfrom the base of the skull to the tip of the coccyx.\n\nThere are seventy-two thousand _nadis_ , or nerves, which form a countless\nnumber of nerve endings. Of the _nadis_ , about a dozen have been thoroughly\nstudied by the Yogins. Three have been found to be of primary importance: The\n_ida_ , or left nostril, the _pingala_ , or right nostril, and the _susumna_ ,\nthe spinal cord. These are believed to exercise control over voluntary and\nautomatic responses of the human body and can be brought under control by\nYogic methods.\n\nCenturies before the recognition of electrical force by scientists, the Yogins\nhad evolved a theory of nerve-impulse transmission which has won acceptance\nfrom Western medical investigators in this century. If we substitute the word\n_prana_ for electrical impulse, we find that the oldest Yoga principles of\nneurology are now endorsed in the modern theory of nerve action. We can now\nunderstand that the Yogins anticipated the principles of electrical phenomena\nby discovering the positive and negative animal-magnetic currents which are\nthe nerve impulses and which may be controlled and adjusted by Yoga practice.\n\nThe physical and mental well-being of every individual depends on the fine\nadjustment of the nervous system which controls even the secreting glands. One\nof the benefits of a Yoga regime is the control or restraint of the various\nmodifications which may take place in the nervous system. In addition to the\nbeneficial effects of the physical aspects of Yoga on the gross and finer\nmuscles and tissues, it also establishes, through the postures and attitudes\nand psycho-physiological practices, complete control over the nervous system.\n\np. 10\n\n[paragraph continues] Only when the nerve impulses can pass in harmony through\nthe spinal cord may _samadhi_ , a state of suspended sensation, be reached.\n\n#### Nervous Ailments\n\nIt is now fashionable to attribute many forms of disease to "nerves," which is\na symptom, not a disease. Since the nervous system is in direct and intimate\nrelationship with every part of the body, the slightest disorder in any organ\nregisters upon the nervous system. Conversely, any serious nerve disorder will\ncause functional distress, and it is often impossible to disassociate the\ncause from the effect.\n\nWhat we term "nervous weakness" is actually the response of a neglected or\nabused nervous system. The conditions that we lump together under the heading\nof "nerves" are merely the call of the nervous system for better care.\nPurification of the nervous system is possible through an improved mental\nattitude, rest, relaxation and recreation and the benefits of postures, or\n_asanas_ , which adjust the tone of the spine and its components.\n\n#### Some Aids to Mental Hygiene\n\nFreedom from emotion is one of the tenets of Yoga. Early modern psychologists\ndiscovered a strong relationship between the emotions and the body in terms of\nincreased or reduced ductless gland secretion, respiration, circulation and\nblood pressure. Yoga medical investigators have attributed diabetes,\narteriosclerosis, nephritis and other diseases to the effects of emotion on\nthe glandular system and thence on the body organs. _Samatva_ , or absolute\nfreedom from emotions, has been set as one of the prime essentials for the\nhealth of\n\np. 11\n\nthe nerves and brain. Even a minor emotional flare-up or a long period of\nsubdued anxiety will affect the body.\n\n#### Concentration\n\nA method of avoiding emotions and anxieties is to train or habituate the mind\nto concentrate on a chosen object. This concentration is called _dharana_.\nWithout purposeful concentration, the mind diffuses its energies in varied\ndirections, while with strong concentration, the mind can be freed of\ndistractions and can approach a state of detachment or non-awareness of\nextraneous matters. This is the essence of concentration. The habit of\nconcentration is known to produce a sedative effect, similar to that induced\nby deep breathing, with manifold benefits to the health of the nervous system.\n\n#### The Need for Recreation\n\nIn India, a troubled individual is often able to retire for a while to an\nAshram, or retreat, where he can live under the best possible conditions for\nthe practice of Yoga and self-realization. (Note the use of the "retreat" by\nthe Roman Catholic and other religions as a means to attain spiritual\nrelaxation.)\n\nOne of the most depressing factors in the Western world is the monotony of\noccupation and the hectic pace required in almost every occupation or\nprofession. In many cases, a change of occupation has effected radical cures\nin instances of nervous disorder, but this is not always feasible. However,\nany change in mental or physical occupation\xc2\x97and the change must be mental as\nwell as physical\xc2\x97will add substantially to the health and tone of the nervous\nsystem.\n\np. 12\n\nPersons of sedentary habits will find relief in outdoor sports, such as\nmountain climbing, hiking, swimming, in addition to the practice of the Yoga\nexercises. For mental relaxation, the Yogins, whose troubled times were yet\nmore calm than life is today, found their recreation in a mental state\xc2\x97in\nstudy and love of nature. By seeking unison with nature, they found that their\nentire beings were called into delightful activity with almost no effort of\nthe will. They learned that the mind which lost itself in the love of nature\nfound its nervous system refreshed, its vital forces renewed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3.
