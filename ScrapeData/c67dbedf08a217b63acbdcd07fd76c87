The \xc3\x82 _s_ vina graha 3, forsooth, is his organ of hearing; hence in\ndrinking it he turns (the cup) all round 4, since with that ear of his he\nhears all round.--Now when the Bh _ri_ gus, or the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, attained the\nheavenly world, _K_ yavana the Bhargava, or _K_ yavana the \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa, was left\nbehind here (on earth) decrepit and ghostlike 5.\n\np. 273\n\n4:1:5:22\\. But _S_ aryata, the Manava, just then wandered about here with his\ntribe, and settled near by that same place. His boys 1, while playing, setting\nthat decrepit, ghostlike man at nought, pelted him with clods.\n\n4:1:5:33\\. He was wroth with the _S_ aryatas, and sowed discord among them:\nfather fought with son, and brother with brother.\n\n4:1:5:44\\. _S_ aryata then bethought him 2,--\'This has come to pass for\nsomething or other I have done!\' He caused the cowherds and shepherds to be\ncalled together, and said--\n\n4:1:5:55\\. He said, \'Which of you has seen anything here this day?\'--They\nsaid, \'Yonder lies a man, decrepit and ghostlike: him the boys have pelted\nwith clods, setting him at nought.\' Then _S_ aryata knew that this was _K_\nyavana.\n\n4:1:5:66\\. He yoked his chariot, and putting his daughter Sukanya thereon, he\nset forth, and came to the place where the _Ri_ shi was.\n\n4:1:5:77\\. He said, \'Reverence be to thee, O _Ri_ shi;\n\np. 274\n\nbecause I knew thee not, therefore have I offended thee; here is Sukanya 1,\nwith her I make atonement to thee: let my tribe live at peace together!\' And\nfrom that same time his tribe lived at peace together. But _S_ aryata, the\nManava, departed 2 forthwith, lest he should offend him a second time.\n\n4:1:5:88\\. Now the A _s_ vins then wandered about here on earth performing\ncures. They came to Sukanya, and desired to win her love; but she consented\nnot thereto.\n\n4:1:5:99\\. They said, \'Sukanya, what a decrepit, ghostlike man is that whom\nthou liest with; come and follow us!\' She said, \'To whom my father has given\nme, him will I not abandon, as long as he lives!\' But the _Ri_ shi was aware\nof this.\n\n4:1:5:1010\\. He said, \'Sukanya, what have those two said to thee?\' She told\nhim all; and, when she had told him, he said, \'If they speak to thee thus\nagain, say thou to them, "But surely, ye are neither quite complete nor quite\nperfect, and yet ye deride my husband!" and if they say to thee, "In what\nrespect are we incomplete, in what respect imperfect?" say thou to them, "Nay,\nmake ye my husband young again, and I will tell you!"\' They came again to her,\nand said to her the same thing.\n\n4:1:5:1111\\. She said, \'But surely ye are neither quite complete nor quite\nperfect, and yet ye deride my husband!\' They said, \'In what respect are we\nincomplete, in what respect imperfect?\' She said, \'Nay, make ye my husband\nyoung again, and I will tell you!\'\n\np. 275\n\n4:1:5:1212\\. They said, \'Take him down to yonder pool 1, and he shall come\nforth with whatever age he shall desire!\' She took him down to that pool, and\nhe came forth with the age he desired.\n\n4:1:5:1313\\. They said, Sukanya, in what respect are we incomplete, in what\nrespect imperfect?\' The _Ri_ shi himself answered them,--\'In Kurukshetra\nyonder the gods perform a sacrifice and exclude you two from it: in that\nrespect ye are incomplete, in that respect imperfect!\' And the A _s_ vins\ndeparted forthwith, and came to the gods, as they were performing a sacrifice,\nafter the chanting of the Bahishpavamana.\n\n4:1:5:1414\\. They said, \'Invite us thereto!\' The gods said, \'We will not\ninvite you: ye have wandered and mixed much among men, performing cures.\'\n\n4:1:5:1515\\. They said, \'But surely ye worship with a\n\np. 276\n\nheadless sacrifice!\'--\'How with a headless (sacrifice)?\'--\'Nay, invite us, and\nwe will tell you!\'--\'So be it!\' so they invited them. They drew this \xc3\x82 _s_\nvina cup for them; and those two became the Adhvaryu priests of the sacrifice,\nand restored the head of the sacrifice. Then, in the chapter of the\ndivakirtyas 1, it is explained how they did restore the head of the sacrifice.\nHence this libation is drawn after the chanting of the Bahishpavamana, for it\nwas after the chanting of the Bahishpavamana that they arrived.\n\n4:1:5:1616\\. They said, \'Well, but we two, being the Adhvaryus, are the heads\n(leaders) of the sacrifice: transfer ye that graha of ours to this earlier\ntime, to those belonging to two deities 2!\' Accordingly they transferred that\ngraha for them to a former time, to those belonging to two deities: hence that\ngraha is drawn in the tenth place, and is consecrated by Vasha _t_ in the\nthird place. And as to (the significance of) the A _s_ vins,--the A _s_ vins\nare manifestly 3 those two, heaven and earth 4, for it is those two\n\np. 277\n\nthat have obtained possession of everything here;--\'the lotus-crowned\' they\n(the A _s_ vins) are called: Agni, forsooth, is the lotus of this earth, and\nthe sun that of yonder sky.\n\n4:1:5:1717\\. Thus he takes (the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina graha) from that (stream of Soma)\n1, with (Va _g_. S. VII, 11; Rig-veda I, 22, 3), \'Mix ye the sacrifice, O A\n_s_ vins, with that goad of yours, rich in honey and joyfulness!--Thou art\ntaken with a support 2! thee for the A _s_ vins!\' with \'This is thy womb: thee\nfor the honey-loving 3 (A _s_ vins)!\' he deposits it. Now as to why he takes\n(the graha) with a verse containing (the word) \'honey (madhu),\' and deposits\nit with \'thee for the honey-loving!\'\n\n4:1:5:1818\\. Dadhya _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ , the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a, imparted to them (the A _s_\nvins) the brahma _n_ a called Madhu 4: that (Madhu) is their favourite resort,\nand with that (favourite resort) of theirs he now approaches them;--hence he\ntakes (their graha) with a verse containing (the word) \'honey,\' and deposits\nit with \'thee for the honey-loving!\'\n\n4:1:5:1919\\. Now those vessels (other than those of the three dvidevatya\ngrahas) are smooth 5. The vessel of the graha for Indra and Vayu has a\n(wooden)\n\np. 278\n\n[paragraph continues] \'belt\' round it: this is its second (peculiarity of)\nshape, and therefore it belongs to two deities. The vessel of the graha for\nMitra and Varu _n_ a is goat-like 1: this is its second shape, and therefore\nit belongs to two deities. The vessel of the graha for the A _s_ vins is lip-\nshaped: this is its second shape, and therefore it belongs to two deities. And\nthe reason why (this belongs to) the A _s_ vins is that the A _s_ vins are the\nheads (mukhya, viz. of the sacrifice), and this head (mukha 2) is supplied\nwith lips: hence the vessel of the A _s_ vina graha is lip-shaped.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[272:3](sbe2644.htm#fr_655) The A _s_ vina graha is not actually taken at this\ntime, but later on, after the oblation of drops and the chanting of the\nBahishpavamana stotra; see [IV, 2, 5, 12](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:12). The reasons\nfor inserting it here are given in parag.\n[15](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5:15)-[16](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5:16).\n\n[272:4](sbe2644.htm#fr_656) Lit. \'he drinks it while turning it all round,\' in\naccordance with the regular Sanskrit idiom. The \xc3\x82 _s_ vina cup has three\nmouths, from which the Soma is drunk by turns. See Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p.\n132.\n\n[272:5](sbe2644.htm#fr_657) On this legend, and its probable connection with\nthat of Medea\'s cauldron, and the Germanic \'quecprunno\' (Jungbrunnen, well of\nrenovation), see A. Kuhn, \'Herabkunft des Feuers and des Gottertranks,\' p. 11.\nFor other translations, see Weber, Ind. Streifen, i. p. 13 seq.; Muir, O. S.\nT. v. p. 250 seq.; Delbruck ii. p. 121. For p. 273 another version, apparently\nmore modern, of the same legend, found in the _G_ aiminiya (Talavakara) Brahma\n_n_ a, see Professor Whitney, Proceedings Amer. Or. Soc. 1883, p. ix.\n\n[273:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_658) That is, youths of his clan.\n\n[273:2](sbe2644.htm#fr_659) _S_ aryata then bethought him, \'From something I\nhave done, thence (has come) so great a calamity.\' It then occurred to him,\n\'Surely, _K_ yavana, the Bhargava, or \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa, was left behind here,\ndecrepit: him I (must) have somehow offended sorely, thence so great a\ncalamity.\' He called his tribe together. Having called the tribe together, he\nsaid, \'Who, be he cowherd or shepherd, has noticed anything here?\' They said,\n\'Yonder in the wood lies a decrepit, ghostlike man; him the boys have this day\npelted with clods: that is the only thing we have descried (? tad\nevadarishma),\' &c. Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[274:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_660) That is, \'the fair maiden.\'\n\n[274:2](sbe2644.htm#fr_661) That is, \'he broke up his camp and departed with\nhis tribe\' (so \'payuyu _g_ e grama _h_ , Ka _n_ va recension).\n\n[275:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_662) Or, according to the Petersburg Dictionary, \'Throw\nhim into yonder pool.\' In the Ka _n_ va text no mention is made of a pool\n(hrada), but merely of water to which the _Ri_ shi is taken by his wife. I\nsubjoin Professor Whitney\'s translation of the corresponding passage of the\n_G_ aiminiya Br. version: They (the A _s_ vins) said to him: "Sage, make us\nsharers in the Soma, Sir." "Very well," said he; "do you now make me young\nagain." They drew him away to the _s_ ai _s_ ava of the Sarasvat\xc4\xab. He said:\n"Girl, we shall all come out looking alike; do you then know me by this sign."\nThey all came out looking just alike, with that form which is the most\nbeautiful of forms. She, recognising him . . . . "This is my husband." They\nsaid to him: "Sage, we have performed for you that desire which has been your\ndesire; you have become young again; now instruct us in such wise that we may\nbe sharers in the Soma,". . . .\n\nThen _K_ yavana the Bh\xc4\x81rgavan, having become young again, went to _K_ ary\xc4\x81ta\nthe M\xc4\x81navan, and conducted his sacrifice on the eastern site. Then he gave him\na thousand; with them he sacrificed. Thus _K_ yavana the Bh\xc4\x81rgavan, having\npraised with this s\xc4\x81man (the _k_ y\xc4\x81vana), became young again, won a girl for\nwife, sacrificed with a thousand,\' &c.\n\n[276:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_663) Certain verses which are \'to be chanted by day.\'\nAccording to Benfey (Ind. Stud. III, p. 228) also called mahadivakirtya, and\nconsisting of eleven verses (not in Sama-veda), the first of which is called \'\n_s_ iras (head),\' the second \'griva _h_ (neck),\' &c. The term is also applied\nto Sama-veda II, 803-5 (Rig-veda X, 170,1-3) in the Uhyagana II, 12. The\nreference in the text seems to be to _S_ at. Br. XIV, 1, 1, 8 seq. See,\nhowever, Weber, Ind. Streifen, I, p. 15, note 4. The Ka _n_ va MSS. read\n\'divakirteshu.\'\n\n[276:2](sbe2644.htm#fr_664) One might expect the dual \'dvidevatyau,\' as,\nbesides the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina graha, there are only two dvidevatya (belonging to two\ngods) grahas, viz. the Aindra-vayava and Maitra-varu _n_ a. See [p.\n266](sbe2642.htm#page_266), note [3](sbe2642.htm#fn_639).\n\n[276:3](sbe2644.htm#fr_665) Or, in their visible form (pratyaksham).\n\n[276:4](sbe2644.htm#fr_666) See Muir, O. S. T. v, p. 234. The identification\nof the A _s_ vins with heaven and earth may have been suggested by Rig-veda\nVI, 70, 5, p. 277 where heaven and earth are called upon to mix the sweet\ndrink, just as is the case with the A _s_ vins in the verse with which their\nlibation is taken.\n\n[277:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_667) See [p. 256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note\n[1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619).\n\n[277:2](sbe2644.htm#fr_668) See [IV, 1, 2, 6](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:6), and note.\n\n[277:3](sbe2644.htm#fr_669) The real meaning of this epithet (madhvi) is\nuncertain.\n\n[277:4](sbe2644.htm#fr_670) ? \'The mystery called Madhu (sweet drink, Soma).\'\nSee part i, Introd. p. xxxiv; Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 2\n\n[277:5](sbe2644.htm#fr_671) It might also mean, that those (three dvidevatya)\nvessels are smooth, straight, save the peculiarities noticed above. The Ka _n_\nva text, however, reads, ta _k_ _kh_ lakshna _n_ y anyani patra _n_ i\nbhavanti.\n\n[278:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_672) Or rather, according to the commentary on Katy.\nIX, 2, 6, it resembles the breast of the goat (a _g_ aka).\n\n[278:2](sbe2644.htm#fr_673) Lit. \'mouth.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 1.
