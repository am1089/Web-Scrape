In it are heroes (bearing) large\nbows, the equals of Bhima and Ar _g_ una in battle--(namely), Yuyudhana, Vira\n_t_ a, and Drupada, the master of a great car 2, and Dh _ri_ sh _t_ aketu, _K_\nekitana, and the valiant king of Kasi, Puru _g_ it and Kuntibho _g_ a, and\nthat eminent man _S_ aibya; the heroic Yudhamanyu, the valiant Uttamau _g_ as,\nthe son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi\\--all masters of great cars. And\nnow, O best of Brahma _n_ as!\n\np. 38\n\nlearn who are most distinguished among us, and are leaders of my army. I will\nname them to you, in order that you may know them well. Yourself, and Bhishma,\nand Kar _n_ a, and K _ri_ pa the victor of (many) battles; A _s_ vatthaman,\nand Vikar _n_ a, and also the son of Somadatta, and many other brave men, who\nhave given up their lives for me, who fight with various weapons, (and are)\nall dexterous in battle. Thus our army which is protected by Bhishma is\nunlimited; while this army of theirs which is protected by Bhima is very\nlimited. And therefore do ye all, occupying respectively the positions 1\nassigned to you, protect Bhishma 2 only.'\n\nThen his powerful grandsire, Bhishma, the oldest of the Kauravas, roaring\naloud like a lion, blew his conch, (thereby) affording delight to Duryodhana.\nAnd then all at once, conchs, and kettledrums, and tabors, and trumpets were\nplayed upon; and there was a tumultuous din. Then, too, Madhava and the son of\nPa _nd_ u (Ar _g_ una), seated in a grand chariot to which white steeds were\nyoked, blew their heavenly conchs. H _ri_ shike _s_ a 3 blew the Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ a _g_\nanya 4, and Dhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya the Devadatta, and Bhima, (the doer) of fearful\ndeeds, blew the great conch Pau _nd_ ra. King Yudhish _th_ ira, the son of\nKunti 5, blew the Anantavi _g_ aya, and Nakula and Sahadeva (respectively)\n\np. 39\n\nthe Sughosha and Ma _n_ ipushpaka. And the king of Ka _s_ i, too, who has an\nexcellent bow, and Sikha _nd_ in, the master of a great car, and Dh _ri_ sh\n_t_ adyumna, Vira _t_ a, and the unconquered Satyaki, and Drupada, and the\nsons of Draupadi, and the son of Subhadra, of mighty arms, blew conchs\nseverally from all sides, O king of the earth! That tumultuous din rent the\nhearts of all (the people) of Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra's (party), causing\nreverberations throughout heaven and earth. Then seeing (the people of ) Dh\n_ri_ tarash _t_ ra's party regularly marshalled, the son of Pa _nd_ u, whose\nstandard is the ape, raised his bow 1, after the discharge of missiles had\ncommenced, and O king of the earth! spake these words to H _ri_ shike _s_ a:\n'O undegraded one! station my chariot between the two armies, while I observe\nthose, who stand here desirous to engage in battle, and with whom, in the\nlabours of this struggle, I must do battle. I will observe those who are\nassembled here and who are about to engage in battle, wishing to do service in\nbattle 2 to the evil-minded son of Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra.'\n\nSa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya said:\n\nThus addressed by Gu _d_ ake _s_ a 3, O descendant of Bharata 4! H _ri_ shike\n_s_ a stationed that excellent chariot between the two armies, in front of\nBhishma and Dro _n_ a and of all the kings of the earth, and\n\np. 40\n\nsaid O son of P _ri_ tha! look at these assembled Kauravas.' There the son of\nP _ri_ tha saw in both armies, fathers and grandfathers, preceptors, maternal\nuncles, brothers, sons 1, grandsons, companions, fathers-in-law, as well as\nfriends. And seeing all those kinsmen standing (there), the son of Kunti was\novercome by excessive pity, and spake thus despondingly.\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nSeeing these kinsmen, O K _ri_ sh _n_ a! standing (here) desirous to engage in\nbattle, my limbs droop down; my mouth is quite dried up; a tremor comes on my\nbody; and my hairs stand on end; the Ga _nd_ iva (bow) slips from my hand; my\nskin burns intensely. I am unable, too, to stand up; my mind whirls round, as\nit were; O Ke _s_ ava! I see adverse omens 2; and I do not perceive any good\n(to accrue) after killing (my) kinsmen in the battle. I do not wish for\nvictory, O K _ri_ sh _n_ a! nor sovereignty, nor pleasures: what is\nsovereignty to us, O Govinda! what enjoyments, and even life? Even those, for\nwhose sake we desire sovereignty, enjoyments, and pleasures, are standing here\nfor battle, abandoning life and wealth-preceptors, fathers, sons as well as\ngrandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, as\nalso (other) relatives. These I do not wish to kill, though they kill (me), O\ndestroyer of Madhu 3! even for the sake of sovereignty over the three worlds,\nhow much less then for this earth\n\np. 41\n\n(alone)? What joy shall be ours, O _G_ anardana! after killing Dh _ri_ tarash\n_t_ ra's sons? Killing these felons 1 we shall only incur sin. Therefore it is\nnot proper for us to kill our own kinsmen, the sons of Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra.\nFor how, O Madhava! shall we be happy after killing our own relatives?\nAlthough having their consciences corrupted by avarice, they do not see the\nevils flowing from the extinction of a family, and the sin in treachery to\nfriends, still, O Ganardana! should not we, who do see the evils flowing from\nthe extinction of a family, learn to refrain from that sin? On the extinction\nof a family, the eternal rites of families are destroyed 2. Those rites being\ndestroyed, impiety predominates over the whole family 3. In consequence of the\npredominance of impiety, O K _ri_ sh _n_ a! the women of the family become\ncorrupt 4; and the women becoming corrupt, O descendant of V _ri_ sh _n_ i!\nintermingling of castes results; that intermingling necessarily leads the\nfamily and the destroyers of the family to hell; for when the ceremonies of\n(offering) the balls of food and water (to them) fail 5, their ancestors fall\ndown (to hell). By these transgressions of the destroyers of families, which\noccasion interminglings of castes, the eternal rites of castes and rites, of\nfamilies are\n\np. 42\n\nsubverted. And O _G_ anardana! we have heard that men whose family-rites are\nsubverted, must necessarily live in hell. Alas! we are engaged in committing a\nheinous sin, seeing that we are making efforts for killing our own kinsmen out\nof greed of the pleasures of sovereignty. If the sons of Dh _ri_ tarash _t_\nra, weapon in hand, should kill me in battle, me weaponless and not defending\n(myself), that would be better for me.\n\nSa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya said:\n\nHaving spoken thus, Ar _g_ una cast aside his bow together with the arrows, on\nthe battle-field, and sat down in (his) chariot, with a mind agitated by\ngrief.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[37:1](sbe0803.htm#fr_87) Several of these modes of array are described in\nManu VII, 187, like a staff, like a wain, like a boar, &c.

Nilaka _nth_ a also suggests, that it may mean 'of thick hair.'\n\n[39:4](sbe0803.htm#fr_97) The son of Dushyanta and _S_ akuntala, after whom\nIndia is called 'Bharatavarsha,' and from whom both Pa _nd_ avas and Kauravas\nwere descended.\n\n[40:1](sbe0803.htm#fr_98) The words in this list include all standing in\nsimilar relationships to those directly signified.\n\n[40:2](sbe0803.htm#fr_99) Such as the appearance of vultures, cars moving\nwithout horses, &c., mentioned in the Bhishma Parvan II, 17. Cf. Sutta Nipata,\np. 100.\n\n[40:3](sbe0803.htm#fr_100) A demon of this name.\n\n[41:1](sbe0803.htm#fr_101) Six classes are mentioned: an incendiary; one who\nadministers poison; one who assaults another--weapon in hand; one who destroys\nproperty; one who robs another of his wife; or his fields.\n\n[41:2](sbe0803.htm#fr_102) I. e. there being none to attend to the 'rites,'\nwomen being ineligible.\n\n[41:3](sbe0803.htm#fr_103) I. e. the surviving members.\n\n[41:4](sbe0803.htm#fr_104) I. e. either by the mere fact of relationship to\nsuch men, or by following their bad example.\n\n[41:5](sbe0803.htm#fr_105) There being no qualified person to perform them;\n'their ancestors'--that is to say, of the 'destroyers of families.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II](sbe0804.htm)\n\n"
