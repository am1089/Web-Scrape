And on account of the word 'Self.'\n\nThe above conclusion is confirmed by the circumstance that the person under\ndiscussion is called the Self in I, 3, 12, 'That Self is hidden in all beings\nand does not shine forth, but it is seen by subtle seers through their sharp\nand subtle intellect.' From this we conclude that the text wishes to represent\nthe other beings enumerated as the Non-Self. The passage quoted, moreover,\nindicates that the person is hard to know, and to be reached by sharp minds\nonly.--Again, the passage (I, 3, 13), 'A wise man should keep down speech and\nmind,' enjoins pious meditation as a means of the knowledge of the highest\nperson, as we have explained under I, 4, 1.--It thus follows that scripture\nindicates various excellences in the case of the purusha only, and not in that\nof the other beings enumerated.--The passage, moreover, 'He reaches the end of\nhis journey and that is the highest place of Vishnu,' suggests the question as\nto who is the end of the journey and so on, and we therefore conclude that the\nenumeration of the senses, objects, &c., has merely the purpose of teaching\nthe highest place of Vishnu (not of teaching anything about the relation of\nthe senses, objects, and so on).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 16](sbe38159.htm)\n\n"
