If an animal (is to be sacrificed), let him wash it, if it is not a cow;\nlet him walk round the fires and drive in front (of them) a Pala _s_ a branch\ninto the ground.\n\n2 2. The winding (of a Ku _s_ a rope) round (that branch), the touching (of\nthe animal with the grass-blade), the binding (of it to the branch), and the\nsprinkling (of the animal with water) should be performed in the way\nprescribed (in the _S_ rauta-sutra), and whatever else (is to be done).\n\n3 3. After he has sacrificed the two oblations before and after the killing of\nthe animal, (he) silently (sacrifices) five other (oblations, directed to Pra\n_g_ apati).\n\n4 4. And the omentum is taken out (of the killed animal). He should besprinkle\nit (with water) and name the deity (to whom the sacrifice is directed).\n\n5 5. (He should name that deity also) at the touching (of the animal with the\ngrass-blade), at (its) being bound (to the branch), at its being sprinkled\n(with water), and at (the preparation and oblation) of the mess of cooked\nfood.\n\n6\\. After he has sacrificed the omentum, he cuts off the Avadana portions,\n\np. 361\n\n7 7. All of them, or three, or five.\n\n8 8. He sacrifices the Avadana portions together with the mess of cooked food.\n\n9\\. A limb of the animal is the sacrificial fee.\n\n10 10-11. At (a sacrifice) directed to a special deity he should sacrifice (an\nanimal) belonging to that deity, should make a portion for that (god), and\nshould say to him (i.e. to the messenger who is to convey that offering to a\nplace sacred to that deity): 'Take care that this may reach that (god).'\n\n11\\. If there is a river between (the sacrificer and that sacred place), he\nmay have a boat made, or he may dispense with this.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[360:1](sbe29201.htm#fr_937) 11, 1. The branch replaces the sacrificial post\n(yupa) of the _S_ rauta ritual. As to agre _n_ a, comp. Katy.- _S_ raut. VI,\n2, 11 and the commentary.\n\n[360:2](sbe29201.htm#fr_938) See Katy.- _S_ raut. VI, 3, 15 on the parivyaya\n_n_ a, ibid. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 19, 26 on the upakara _n_ a, \xc2\xa7 27 on the niyo _g_ ana, \xc2\xa7 33 on\nthe proksha _n_ a.\n\n[360:3](sbe29201.htm#fr_939) Katyayana VI, 5, 22: He sacrifices (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya)\nwith the words, Svaha to the gods.' \xc2\xa7 24: He sacrifices (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) with the\nwords, To the gods svaha.' In the commentary on \xc2\xa7 25 these two oblations are\ncalled paripa _s_ avyahuti.\n\n[360:4](sbe29201.htm#fr_940) See Katyayana VI, 6, 13; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_\nhya I, 11, 10.\n\n[360:5](sbe29201.htm#fr_941) See above, Sutra 2.\n\n[361:7](sbe29201.htm#fr_942) The complete number of the Avadanas (i.e. the\nportions of the killed animal which have to be cut off, such as the heart, the\ntongue, &c.) is eleven; see Katy.- _S_ raut.

The way for interpreting these Sutras\nis shown by \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya I, 12. I do not think that they have\nanything to do, as _G_ ayarama states, with reference to Sutra II, with the\noffering due to a relative who has died while being absent on a journey (chap.\n10, 44).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 12](sbe29202.htm)\n\n"
