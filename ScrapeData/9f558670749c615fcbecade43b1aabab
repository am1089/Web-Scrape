On account of emphasis there is non-omission.\n\nAttributes, such as having the power of immediately realising one's purposes,\nand so on, which are not by other means known to constitute attributes of\nBrahman, and are in the two texts under discussion, as well as in other texts,\nemphatically declared to be attributes of Brahman, as constituting the object\nof meditations undertaken with a view to final release, cannot be omitted from\nthose meditations, but must be comprised within them. In the _Kh_ andogya. the\npassage, 'Those who depart from hence, after having cognised the Self and\nthose self-realising desires, move about at will in all those worlds,' enjoins\nthe knowledge of Brahman as distinguished by the power of realising its\ndesires and similar qualities, while the text, 'Those who depart from here not\nhaving cognised the Self, &c., do _not_ move about at will,' &c., finds fault\nwith the absence of such knowledge, and in this way emphasises the importance\nof the possession of it. In the same way the repeated declarations as to\nBrahman's ruling power ('the lord of all, the king of all beings,' &c.) show\nthat stress is to be laid upon the quality indicated. It truly cannot be held\nthat Scripture, which in tender regard to man's welfare is superior to a\nthousand of parents, should, deceitfully, give emphatic instruction as to\ncertain qualities--not known through any other means of knowledge--which\nfundamentally would be unreal and hence utterly to be disregarded, and thus\nthrow men desirous of release, who as it is are utterly confused by the\nrevolutions of the wheel of Sa _m_ sara, into even deeper confusion and\ndistress. That the text, 'there is not any diversity here; as one only is to\nbe seen that eternal being,' teaches a unitary view of the world in so far as\neverything is an effect of Brahman and thus has Brahman for its Self, and\nnegatives the view of plurality--established antecedently to Vedic teaching--\nas excluding Brahman's being the universal Self, we have explained\n\np. 663\n\nbefore. In the clause 'not so, not so' the so refers back to the world as\nestablished by other means of proof, and the clause thus declares that Brahman\nwho is the Self of all is different in nature from the world. This is\nconfirmed by the subsequent passage, 'He is incomprehensible, for he is not\ncomprehended, he is undecaying,' &c.; which means--as he is different in\nnature from what is comprehended by the other means of proof he is not grasped\nby those means; as he is different from what suffers decay he does not decay,\nand so on. And analogously, in the _Kh_ andogya, the text 'by the old age of\nthe body he does not age' &c. first establishes Brahman's being different in\nnature from everything else, and then declares it to be satyakama, and so on.\n--But, an objection is raised, the text, 'Those who depart from hence, having\ncognised the Self and those true desires, move about at will in all worlds.\nThus he who desires the world of the fathers,' &c., really declares that the\nknowledge of Brahman as possessing the power of immediately realising its\nwishes has for its fruit something lying within the sphere of transmigratory\nexistence, and from this we infer that for him who is desirous of release and\nof reaching Brahman the object of meditation is not to be found in Brahman in\nso far as possessing qualities. The fruit of the highest knowledge is rather\nindicated in the passage, 'Having approached the highest light it manifests\nitself in its own form'; and hence the power of realising its wishes and the\nrest are not to be included in the meditation of him who wishes to attain to\nBrahman.--To this objection the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 40.
