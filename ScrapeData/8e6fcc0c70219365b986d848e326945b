[1b](ry436.htm#fn_955)  \n'I will myself,' the monarch cried,  \n'Be present on the northern side.'  \nThese orders for the walls' defence  \nThe tyrant gave, then parted thence,  \nAnd, by the hope of victory fired,  \nTo chambers far within, retired.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[455:1](ry435.htm#fr_954) Lakshmi is the Goddess both of beauty and fortune,\nand is represented with a lotus in her hand.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXVII.: Preparations.](ry436.htm)\n\n"
