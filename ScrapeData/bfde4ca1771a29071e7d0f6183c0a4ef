Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: Tell me, O Lord, all the rites for those in the other worlds\nwho have done good, and also how these rites should be performed by the sons.\n\n2\\. The Blessed Lord said: O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, you have done well in questioning me for\nthe benefit of mankind. I will tell you all about the rites proper for the\nrighteous.\n\n3-4. The good person, finding his body, in its old age, afflicted with\ndiseases, and the planetary conditions unfavourable, and not hearing the\nsounds of life,\n\nAnd knowing his death to be near, should he fearless and alert, and should\nmake reparation for any sins committed knowingly or in ignorance.\n\n5-8. When it is near the time to die he must perform his ablutions, and\nworship Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u in the form of \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81lagr\xc4\x81ma.\n\np. 62\n\nHe must worship with fragrant substances, with flowers, with red saffron, with\nleaves of the holy basil, with incense, with lamps, with offerings of food and\nmany sweetmeats, and other things.\n\nHe should give presents to Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s, should feed them with the offerings, and\nshould recite the eight and the twelve syllabled mantras.\n\nHe should call to mind, and listen to, the names of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u and \xc5\x9aiva. The name\nof Hari, coming with the range of hearing, takes away the sins of men.\n\n9\\. Relatives, coming near the diseased, should not mourn. My holy name should\nbe remembered and meditated upon repeatedly.\n\n10-11. The Fish, the Tortoise, the Boar, the Man-lion, the Dwarf, Para\xc5\x9bur\xc4\x81ma,\nR\xc4\x81ma, K\xe1\xb9\x9bi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87a, Buddha, and also Kalk\xc4\xab 1:\n\nThese ten names should always be meditated upon by the wise. Those who recite\nthem near the diseased are called relatives.\n\n12-16. Of him who gives voice to the auspicious name "K\xe1\xb9\x9bi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87a" tens of millions\nof great sins are quickly reduced to ashes.\n\nEven the dying Aj\xc4\x81mila reached heaven by pronouncing the name Hari, which had\nbeen given to his son.  2 How much more then is its effect when it is\npronounced with faith!\n\np. 63\n\nHari, meditated upon even by one who has evil thoughts, takes away sins: fire\nburns, even though accidentally touched.\n\nThe sinful man is not able to sin while the power of the name Hari is\nuprooting the sins, O Twice-born.\n\nYama said to his servants: "Bring the man who denies, but O messengers, do not\nbring the man who meditates on the name Hari."\n\n17-20. One should worship the Achyuta, Ke\xc5\x9bava, N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, K\xe1\xb9\x9bi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87a, D\xc4\x81modara,\nV\xc4\x81sudeva, Hari, \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xabdhara, M\xc4\x81dhavam, Gop\xc4\xabk\xc4\x81vallabham, R\xc4\x81machandra, the Lord of\nJ\xc4\x81nak\xc4\xab. 1\n\n"O servants, do not go near those sinless people who take refuge in the lotus-\neyed V\xc4\x81sudeva and Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, who is the supporter of the earth, and carries in his\nhand the conch and discus.\n\n"Bring those sinners who always turn away from time nectar of the lotus-feet\nof Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u,--which are served by the race of Paramaha\xe1\xb9\x85sas, who know the true\nessence of things, and are without possessions,--and those whose desires are\nbound up in the household, which is the path to hell."\n\n"Bring them whose tongues do not pronounce the qualities and name of the Lord,\nwhose minds do not meditate upon His lotus feet, whose heads never bow to\nK\xe1\xb9\x9bi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87a, who do not offer worship to Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u."\n\n21-23. Know, then, O Lord of Birds, the hymning of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, which bestows\nwelfare on the universe, to be the best expiation for even great sins.\n\np. 64\n\nThe performance of penances does not purify the wicked man, who has turned his\nface away from N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a; just as even rivers cannot purify a liquor-pot.\n\nBy the name of K\xe1\xb9\x9bi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87a one is riddened of sins, and never sees, even in dream,\nYama nor his servants.\n\n24-25. The man, having a body of flesh, bones and blood,--who, towards the end\ngives cows to the twice-born, uttering "Nandanandanam," never falls into the\nVaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab.\n\nHence one should remember the name of Mah\xc4\x81 Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, which effaces multitudes of\nsins, and should read or listen to the G\xc4\xabt\xc4\x81 and the Hymn of the Thousand\nNames.\n\n26-27. The fast of the eleventh day, the G\xc4\xabt\xc4\x81, the water of the Ganges, the\nleaves of the holy basil, the foot-water and names of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u--all these are\ngivers of freedom at the time of death.\n\nThen he must dedicate food, with clarified butter and gold, to a learned\ntwice-born and. also give cows with calves.\n\n28-31. Whatever a man gives in his last days, little or much, if it is\napproved by his Son, is exempt from decay, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya.\n\nIn these last days a good son should make all the gifts. It is for the sake of\nthis that the wise pray for a righteous son in this world,\n\np. 65\n\nThe sons, seeing their father lying upon the ground with eyes half-closed,\nshould not covet his earned wealth. 1\n\nA good son will make such gifts as will prolong his father\'s life, and free\nhim from misery when he goes into the next world.\n\n32-34. In disease and calamity two gifts rank above all others. They are\nindispensable--the eight-fold gift of sesamum and other things.\n\nSesamum, iron, gold, cotton stuff, salt, the seven grains, a plot of ground, a\ncow,--every one of these is said to purify.\n\nThe eight great gifts are the effacers of great sins, and should be given in\nthe last days. Hear now their good effects:\n\n35-36. There are three kinds of holy sesamums generated from my sweat. Asuras,\nD\xc4\x81navas and Daityas 2 are gratified by the gift of these sesamums.\n\nWhite, black and brown are the three kinds of sesamums. The gift of these\nremoves the sins gathered in speech, thought and action.\n\n37-40. A gift of iron-ore should be made with the hands touching the ground,--\nthen he does not go within the domain of Yama, nor tread his path.\n\np. 66\n\nYama holds in his hands, for the punishing of the sinful, an axe, a threshing-\npestle, a rod, a sword and a dagger.\n\nThis gift is considered propitiatory to these weapons of Yama. Therefore\nshould be made the gift of iron, which is the bringer of happiness in the\nworld of Yama.\n\nBecause of this gift of iron, happiness is bestowed by these great messengers\nof Yama:--Ura\xe1\xb9\x87a, \xc5\x9ay\xc4\x81mas\xc5\xabtra, \xc5\x9au\xe1\xb9\x87d\xc4\x81marka, Udumbara, \xc5\x9ae\xe1\xb9\xa3a and Bala.\n\n41-44. Hear this great secret, O T\xc4\x81rkshya, about this most supreme gift, by\nwhich are pleased the dwellers in Bh\xc5\xab, Bh\xc5\xabvar and Swar worlds. 1\n\nBrahm\xc4\x81 and others, sages, shining ones, and those who are in the assembly of\nthe King of Justice are gratified by the gift of gold, and become granters of\nboons.\n\nTherefore a gift of gold should be made for the uplifting of the departed. He\ndoes not go to the world of Yama, O child, but reaches heaven.\n\nHe dwells for a long time in the world of truth and is then reborn here as a\nking, handsome, righteous, eloquent, prosperous, and of unexcelled strength.\n\n45\\. By the gift of cotton-stuff one is freed from fear of the messengers. By\nthe gift of salt one is freed from the fear of Yama.\n\np. 67\n\n46-48. By gifts of inn, salt, cotton-stuff, sesamum and gold, Chitragupta and\nthe others who dwell in the city of Yama are propitiated.\n\nAnd by gifts of the seven grains the standard-bearer of the King of Justice\nand others who stand at the gates are propitiated.\n\nRices, barley, wheat, kidney beans, m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xa3a, 1 panic seeds; dwarf-peas: these are\ncalled the seven grains.\n\n49-52. It has been observed by the sages that the gift of a plot of land of\nthe size of a cow\'s hide, in accordance with the rites, to a proper person,\nabsolves one from Brahmicide.\n\nNot by vows, not by holy pilgrimages, not by any gifts but by the gift of land\nis a great sin committed in kingship expiated.\n\nHe who gives to the twice-born land filled with grains goes to the abode of\nIndra and is worshipped by divinities and demons.\n\nAll other gifts, O K\xc4\x81\xc5\x9byapa, are producers of little fruit. The fruit produced\nby the gift of land increases daily.\n\n53-55. He who, having become a king, does not give land to the twice-born, is\nreborn for many times as a beggar, without even a village hut.\n\nThe king who, through pride, does not make gifts of land, shall dwell in hell\nas long as \xc5\x9ae\xe1\xb9\xa3a 2 supports the earth.\n\nTherefore shall a king especially make gifts of land; though for others, I\nsay, the gift, of a cow is equal to a gift of land.\n\np. 68\n\n56-57. Towards the end, a cow should be given. He should give a cow to\novercome death, another to absolve himself of debts, another for the gaining\nof liberation.\n\nWith special rites, O Bird, should the gift of a cow for Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab be made.\nThe cows verily carry the man beyond three kinds of hells.\n\n58-61. The sins committed in boyhood, in youth, in manhood, in old age and in\nprevious births;\n\nThe sins committed in the night, in the morning, in the forenoon and the\nafternoon, in the twilight;--of action, speech and thought,\n\nHaving given even once a tawny cow, milkgiving, with the calf and other\nnecessary things, to a well-conducted and austere Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87, learned in the\nVedas,--one is absolved of all these sins. The giver is released by her at the\nend from the accumulated sins.\n\n62-63. The gift of one cow while one is in full vigour of mind, the gift of a\nhundred cows while suffering from diseases, the gift of a thousand when dying\nand bereft of mental faculties,\n\nAnd the gift of one hundred thousand cows after death 1, are equal. A gift\nmade to a deserving person, who has bathed at the sacred waters, increases a\nhundred thousand fold.\n\np. 69\n\n64\\. A gift made to a deserving person multiplies a hundred-thousand-fold. It\nbrings unending fruit to the giver and does not harm the recipient.\n\n65-68. One who has studied the scriptures and made fire-offerings to the\nshining ones and who does not eat food cooked by others is not polluted by\nreceiving even the earth filled with precious stones.\n\nMantras and fire, the removers of cold and poison, do not themselves partake\nof these evil qualities. The cow given to an undeserving person leads the\ngiver to hell,\n\nAnd it troubles the recipient\'s people for a hundred generations. A gift\nshould not be made to an undeserving person by the wise who desire their own\nwelfare.\n\nOne cow should be given to one only, and never to many. If he either sells it\nor shares it his family will he troubled to the seventh generation.\n\n69\\. I will tell you about the gilt of a cow, which is a means for crossing\nthe Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab River, of which I have spoken to you already.\n\np. 70\n\n70-76. One should decorate a black or reddish cow, tip its horns with gold,\nsilver its feet, and milk it into a bronze vessel;\n\nCover it with a pair of black cloths, hang a bell round its neck, and place\nthe covered bronze vessel upon some cotton-stuff,\n\nPut there a golden image of Yama, and an iron rod; place clarified butter in\nthe bronze vessel and put all upon the cow;\n\nMake a raft of sugarcanes, fastening it with silk threads; make a hole, fill\nit with water, and in it place the raft:\n\nHaving placed the things which are born from the body of the sun in it,\ndedicate the cow there in accordance with the scriptures. 1\n\nPresent the cloths, with ornaments to a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87; properly worship with\nfragrances, flowers, and coloured rice 2,\n\nTake hold of the tail of the cow, place a foot in the boat, and, having\nhonoured a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87, recite this mantra:--\n\n77-82. "O Lord of the Universe, compassionate to those who seek refuge in\nThee, Thou art verily the saviour of those who are immersed in the ocean of\nexistence, made miserable by the waves of sorrow and remorse.\n\np. 71\n\n"O Best of the Twice-born, the very form of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, God upon earth, uplift me.\nI have presented this gift to you. Salutations to Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab!\n\n"I have presented this to you, being desirous of crossing that river, which is\na hundred yojanas in extent, and lies on the very dreadful way of Yama.\nSalutations to Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab.\n\n"O Cow, look upon me, for the sake of my passing through the gateway of Yama\non the great path. Salutations to thee, Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab, Queen of the shining ones!\n\n"May cows be in front of me; may cows be behind me; may cows be in my heart 1;\nand may I dwell in the midst of cows.\n\n"May she who is the Goddess of Prosperity for all creatures, who is the\nmainstay of the shining ones, its the form of a cow remove my sins."\n\n83-84. With hands together having invoiced, with these mantras, Yama in the\nform of a cow, and having walked round all these things, he should give them\nto the Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87.\n\nHe who, with these rites, gives the Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab cow, goes by a righteous path\ninto the assembly of the King of Justice.\n\n85-86. Whether the body is well or ill one should carry out the Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab\nobservance. The wise man, desiring to cross that river, should make a gift of\na cow.\n\nThat river, O Bird, does not appear in the Great Way after the gift of a cow.\n2 Therefore it is necessary to give a cow at all sacred times.\n\np. 72\n\n87-88. At all the sacred bathing-places, like the Ganges, and in the dwelling-\nplaces of Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s; at the eclipses of the sun and moon, at the crossing over\n1, on the day of the new moon.\n\nAt the equinoctial and solstitial points, at Vyat\xc4\xabp\xc4\x81ta, 2 on Yuga days 3 and\nat other sacred times,--the supreme gift of a cow should be made.\n\n89\\. That verily is called the sacred time, in which faith is produced, and\nwhen a proper person is present,--thence flows unending benefit.\n\n90\\. Bodies are transitory; possessions are not eternal; death is always\nnear;--one should accumulate righteousness.\n\n91-92. So one who desires his own welfare should make unending gifts,\naccording to his wealth, to a learned Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87.\n\nThe gift of even a little wealth, presented with one\'s own hand:--this is\nunending, and the time is effectual.\n\n93-94. He who has gifts as provision, goes happily on the Great Way. Otherwise\n--without provision--the man suffers pain on the path.\n\nAll the gifts made by human beings in this world clear the way for them on the\npath of the world of Yama.\n\np. 73\n\n95-96. By the power of great merit, birth as a human being is obtained. He\nwho, having gained it, follows righteousness, reaches the supreme goal.\n\nThe man who neglects righteousness, goes and comes in misery. The fruitfulness\nof birth as a human being depends upon the pursuit of righteousness alone.\n\n97-99. Wealth, sons, wife and fancily, body, kinsmen,--all these are\ntransitory. Therefore righteousness should be sought.\n\nSo long as a man is alive he has a father and other relatives; but when they\nhave known him to be dead, their affection soon fades away.\n\nHe should constantly remember that the true kinsman of the self is the Self.\nIf not to the living, much less will anyone give to the dead.\n\n100\\. Knowing all this, one should give with one\'s own hand, while still\nalive. Life is transient; and who can give afterwards?\n\n101-102. The relatives turn away with averted faces leaving the dead body on\nthe ground, like a lump of wood or earth, but righteousness goes with him.\n\nThe wealth disappears from the house, and the relatives from the cremation-\nground. The good and evil karma he has made goes with him.\n\n103-104. When his body has been destroyed by fire his karma remains and\nwherever he is the man experiences it, be it good or bad.\n\np. 74\n\nNobody has a relation in this changing ocean of sorrow. He is born by the\nattraction of karma, and goes again upon its exhaustion.\n\n105-106. Like creatures in a water-tank, and like the motion or sticks in a\nriver is one\'s contact with mother, father, son, brother, kinsman, wife and\nthe others.\n\nWhose are the sons, and the grandsons? Whose is the wife, or the wealth? In\nthe world of change nobody belongs to anybody. Therefore one should make gifts\nhimself.\n\n107-100. As long as one is in possession of wealth, so long should one make\ngifts to a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87; but when the wealth becomes another\'s one can have nothing\nto say.\n\nOn account of gifts made in a former birth much wealth is obtained in this.\nHence should wealth be given, by one knowing this, for the sake of\nrighteousness.\n\nWealth is born of righteousness; by righteousness desire is conquered.\nRighteousness verily is the cause of freedom. Therefore should righteousness\nbe pursued.\n\n110-111. Righteousness is supported by faith, not by large piles of wealth.\nThe wise, though in poverty, leave faith, and go to heaven. From him who\noffers to Me, with devotion, a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water--from him, the\nself-subdued, I accept that, presented with devotion.\n\np. 75\n\n112\\. Therefore, by all means, a gift should be made, and as prescribed.\nWhether it be small or great does not count with me.\n\n113-114. A righteous son is honoured even by the shining ones. He should cause\nhis ailing father to make gifts on earth.\n\nIf the wealth made by the father is given to the deserving by the sons--then,\nby that, himself, his sets, grandsons and great-grandsons are ennobled.\n\n115\\. What is given through the father has a hundred-fold merit; through the\nmother, a thousand-fold; through the sister, ten-thousand fold; through the\nbrother, incalculable.\n\n116-118. For him who makes gifts there are no troubles and no torments of\nhell, and no fear caused by the messengers of Yama at the time of death.\n\nAll those sinful-misers, O Bird, who, because of greed, do not make gifts at\nthe time of illness come to grief when dead.\n\nSons, grandsons, brothers, kinsmen and friends who do not make gifts on behalf\nof a dying man are without doubt slayers of Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[62:1](gpu10.htm#fr_68) The ten avat\xc4\x81ras, descents or incarnations of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u,\nwhich appeared in archaic and ancient times, except Kalk\xc4\xab, who is still to\ncome.\n\n[62:2](gpu10.htm#fr_69) Aj\xc4\x81mila was a man of very evil life, who named his son\nN\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, and happened to call him as he was dying.\n\n[63:1](gpu10.htm#fr_70) Names of Vishnu.\n\n[65:1](gpu10.htm#fr_71) They may expect ancestral property, but not that\nearned by the father.\n\n[65:2](gpu10.htm#fr_72) Classes of non-human beings.\n\n[66:1](gpu10.htm#fr_73) Physical, astral and lower mental worlds.\n\n[67:1](gpu10.htm#fr_74) A kind of spotted grain.\n\n[67:2](gpu10.htm#fr_75) The eternal serpent.\n\n[68:1](gpu10.htm#fr_76) That is, given by another for one.\n\n[70:1](gpu10.htm#fr_77) Probably the afore-mentioned cow, ghee, gold, silk,\netc. are closely connected with sacrifice and therefore with the sun.\n\n[70:2](gpu10.htm#fr_78) Ak\xe1\xb9\xa3ata, whole rice coloured with turmeric and saffron,\nand used to honour persons by sprinkling over them.\n\n[71:1](gpu10.htm#fr_79) Note here, that the cow is merely a symbol.\n\n[71:2](gpu10.htm#fr_80) Note the subjective character of the "river."\n\n[72:1](gpu10.htm#fr_81) The passing of the sun from one constellation to\nanother.\n\n[72:2](gpu10.htm#fr_82) When the sun and moon are on opposite sides of either\nsolstice, and the minutes declination are the same.\n\n[72:3](gpu10.htm#fr_83) Every month there is a day called Yuga--the last or\nlast but one.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX.
