XX.\n\nDescendants of Kuru. Devapi abdicates the throne: assumed by \xc5\x9aantanu: he is\nconfirmed by the Brahmans: Bhishma his son by Ganga: his other sons. Birth of\nDhritarasht\xcc\x81ra, Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u, and Vidura. The hundred sons of Dhritarasht\xcc\x81ra. The\nfive sons of Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u: married to Draupadi: their posterity. Parikshit, the\ngrandson of Arjuna, the reigning king.\n\nPAR\xc3\x8dKSHIT, the son of Kuru, had four sons, Janamejaya, \xc5\x9arutasena, Ugrasena,\nand Bhimasena 1. The son of Jahnu was Suratha; his son was Viduratha; his son\nwas Sarvabhauma; his son was Jayasena \xc3\x81ravin; his son was Ayutayus; his son\nwas Akrodhana; one of his sons was Devatithi, and another was called Riksha;\nhis son was Dilipa; his son was Pratipa, who had three sons, Devapi, \xc5\x9aantanu,\nand Bahlika. The first adopted in childhood a forest life, and \xc5\x9aantanu became\nking. Of him this verse is spread through the earth; "\xc5\x9aantanu is his name,\nbecause if he lays his hands upon an old man, he restores him to youth, and by\nhim men obtain tranquillity (\xc5\x9banti)."\n\np. 458\n\nIn the kingdom over which \xc5\x9aantanu ruled there was no rain for twelve years.\nApprehensive that the country would become a desert, the king assembled the\nBrahmans, and asked them why no rain fell, and what fault he had committed.\nThey told him that he was as it were a younger brother married before an\nelder, for he was in the enjoyment of the earth, which was the right of his\nelder brother Devapi. "What then am I to do?" said the Raja: to which they\nreplied, "Until the gods shall be displeased with Devapi, by his declining\nfrom the path of righteousness, the kingdom is his, and to him therefore you\nshould resign it." When the minister of the king, Asmarisarin, heard this, he\ncollected a number of ascetics who taught doctrines opposed to those of the\nVedas, and sent them into the forest; where meeting with Devapi, they\nperverted the understanding of the simple-minded prince, and led him to adopt\nheretical notions. In the meantime, \xc5\x9aantanu being much distressed to think\nthat he had been guilty of the offence intimated by the Brahmans, sent them\nbefore him into the woods, and then proceeded thither himself, to restore the\nkingdom to his elder brother. When the Brahmans arrived at the hermitage of\nDevapi, they informed him, that, according to the doctrines of the Vedas,\nsuccession to a kingdom was the right of the elder brother: but he entered\ninto discussion with them, and in various ways advanced arguments which had\nthe defect of being contrary to the precepts of the Vedas. When the Brahmans\nheard this, they turned to \xc5\x9aantanu, and said, "Come hither, Raja; you need\ngive yourself no further trouble in this matter; the dearth is at an end: this\nman is fallen from his state, for he has uttered words of disrespect to the\nauthority of the eternal, untreated Veda; and when the elder brother is\ndegraded, there is no sin in the prior espousals of his junior." \xc5\x9aantanu\nthereupon returned to his capital, and administered the government as before;\nand his elder brother Devapi being degraded from his caste by repeating\ndoctrines contrary to the Vedas, Indra poured down abundant rain, which was\nfollowed by plentiful harvests 2.\n\np. 459\n\nThe son of Bahlika was Somadatta, who had three sons, Bhuri, Bhuri\xc5\x9bravas, and\n\xc5\x9aala 3.\n\nThe son of \xc5\x9aantanu was the illustrious and learned Bhishma, who was born to\nhim by the holy river-goddess, Ganga; and he had by his wife Satyavati two\nsons, Chitrangada and Vichitraviryya. Chitrangada, whilst yet a youth, was\nkilled in a conflict with a Gandharba, also called Chitrangada. Vichitraviryya\nmarried Amba and Ambalika, the daughters of the king of Ka\xc5\x9bi; and indulging\ntoo freely in connubial rites, fell into a consumption, of which he died. By\ncommand of Satyavati, my son Krishn\xcc\x81a-dwaipayana, ever obedient to his\nmother\'s wishes 4, begot upon the widows of his brother the princes\nDhritarasht\xcc\x81ra and Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u, and upon a female servant, Vidura. Dhritarasht\xcc\x81ra\nhad Duryodhana, Duhsa\xc5\x9bana, and other sons, to the cumber of a hundred. Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u\nhaving incurred the curse of a deer, whose mate he had killed in the chase,\nwas deterred from procreating children; and his wife Kunti, bare to him in\nconsequence three sons, who were begotten by the deities Dharma, Vayu, and\nIndra; namely, Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira, Bhima, and Arjuna: and his wife Madri had two\nsons, Nakula and Sahadeva, by the celestial sons of A\xc5\x9bwini. These had each a\nson by Draupadi. The son of Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira was Prativindhya; of Bhima,\n\xc5\x9arutasoma; of Arjuna, \xc5\x9arutakirtti; of Nakula, \xc5\x9aatanika; and of Sahadeva,\n\xc5\x9arutakarman. The Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81avas had also other sons 5. By his wife Yaudheyi,\nYudhisht\xcc\x81hira had Devaka.\n\np. 460\n\n[paragraph continues] The son of Bhima by Hid\xcc\x81imba was Ghat\xcc\x81otkacha, and he\nhad also Sarvatraga by his wife Ka\xc5\x9bi. The son of Sahadeva by Vijaya was\nSuhotra; and Niramitra was the son of Nakula by Karen\xcc\x81umati. Arjuna had Iravat\nby the serpent-nymph Ulupi; Babhruvahana, who was adopted as the son of his\nmaternal grandfather, by the daughter of the king of Manipura; and, by his\nwife Subhadra Abhimanyu, who even in extreme youth was renowned for his valour\nand his strength, and crushed the chariots of his foes in fight. The son of\nAbhimanyu by his wife Uttara was Parikshit, who, after the Kurus were all\ndestroyed, was killed in his mother\'s womb by the magic Brahma weapon, hurled\nby Aswatthaman: he was however restored to life by the clemency of that being\nwhose feet receive the homage of all the demons and the gods, and who for his\nown pleasure had assumed a human shape (Krishn\xcc\x81a). This prince, Parikshit, now\nreigns over the whole world with undivided sway 6.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[457:1](vp113.htm#fr_1278) This, although it occurs in other authorities,\nappears to be an error, for these are the sons of a subsequent Parikshit (see\nthe next chapter, [p. 461](vp114.htm#page_461)). The Matsya omits Parikshit\nhere, and the Bhagavata states that he had no children. In most of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as, however, the line of Parikshit is continued, but there is very great\nconfusion in the lineage. According to the Vayu, Janamejaya was the son of\nParikshit, whose son was \xc5\x9arutasena, whose son was Bhimasena. Janamejaya had\nalso a son named Suratha; but Suratha was also the name of the son of Jahnu,\nfrom whom the line continues as in the text. The Brahma P. and Hari V. also\nmake Suratha the son both of Janamejaya and of Jahnu; and they observe that\nthere are two Rikshas, two Parikshits, three Bhimasenas, and two Janamejayas,\nin the lunar race. Some of the confusion probably originates with the\nMahabharata, which, as before noticed, gives two lists from Puru to \xc5\x9aantanu,\ndiffering from one another and from all the lists of the Puran\xcc\x81as. In the\nfirst of these lists such collateral names have been retained as appear to\nhave furnished our text and that of other Puran\xcc\x81as with distinct persons: thus\nmaking the members of one fraternity so many descents. Of the two lists,\nhowever, the second is probably to be regarded as the more recent, if not more\ncorrect; for Vai\xc5\x9bampayana repeats it at Janamejaya\'s request, because the\nlatter is not satisfied with the summary account which the former had first\ncommunicated to him. Mahabh. vol. I, p. 136 and p. 138.\n\n[458:2](vp113.htm#fr_1279) The Mahabharata merely states that Devapi retired\nto a religious life. The story of his heresy is narrated, much as in the text,\nin the Bhagavata, Vayu, &c. The Matsya adds, that he was also leprous; on\nwhich account his subjects contemned him. p. 459 He was probably set aside in\nfavour of his younger brother, either on that account or on that of his\nheresy; such a disposition being conformable to Hindu law. According to the\nBhagavata and Matsya he is still alive at a place called Kalapa grama, where,\nin the Krita age of the next Mahayuga, he will be the restorer of the\nKshatriya race.\n\n[459:3](vp113.htm#fr_1280) The Matsya says that Bahlika had a hundred sons or\nlords of the Bahlikas.\n\n[459:4](vp113.htm#fr_1281) Before her marriage to \xc5\x9aantanu, Satyavati had a\nson, Krishn\xcc\x81a-dwaipayana or Vyasa, by Para\xc5\x9bara: he was therefore the half\nbrother of Vichitraviryya, and legally qualified to raise up offspring to him\nby his widow. This law is abrogated in the present age. The whole story of the\nsons of \xc5\x9aantanu is told at length in the Mahabharata.\n\n[459:5](vp113.htm#fr_1282) The Mahabharata names some of them rather\ndifferently, and adds some particulars. Thus Yaudheya was the son of\nYudhisht\xcc\x81hira by his wife Devika, daughter of Govasana of the \xc5\x9aaivya tribe.\nThe son of Bhimasena was Sarvaga, by Balandhara, princess of Ka\xc5\x9bi; he had also\nGhat\xcc\x81okkacha by Hid\xcc\x81imba. Abhimanyu was the p. 460 son of Arjuna by Subhadra.\nThe wives and sons of the other two are the same, but Karen\xcc\x81umati is termed a\nprincess [of](errata.htm#21) Chedi, and Vijaya of Madra.\n\n[460:6](vp113.htm#fr_1283) In the details immediately preceding, the Puran\xcc\x81as\ngenerally concur, deriving them probably from the same source, the \xc3\x81di Parvan\nof the Mahabharata, and employing very frequently the same words. The period\nat which the chapter closes is supposed to be that at which the Vyasa, who\narranged or compiled the Puran\xcc\x81as, is believed to have flourished. Parikshit\ndied of the bite of a snake, according to the Mahabharata, \xc3\x81di P. The\nBhagavata is supposed to have been narrated to him in the interval between the\nbite and its fatal effect.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXI](vp114.htm)\n\n'
