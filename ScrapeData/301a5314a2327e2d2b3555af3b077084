There is pre-eminence of plenitude, as in the case of the sacrifice; for\nthus Scripture shows.\n\nThe sacred text ( _Kh_. Up. V, 12 ff.) enjoins a meditation on Vai _s_ vanara,\nthe object of which is the highest Self, as having for its body the entire\nthreefold world, and for its limbs the heavenly world, the sun, the wind, and\nso on. The doubt here arises whether separate meditations have to be performed\non the highest Being in its separate aspects, or in its aggregate as well as\nin its distributed aspect, or in its aggregate aspect only.--In its separate\naspects, the Purvapakshin maintains; since at the outset a meditation of that\nkind is declared. For on the _Ri_ shis in succession telling A _s_ vapati the\nobjects of their meditation, viz. the sky, the sun, and so on, A _s_ vapati\nexplains to them that these meditations refer to the head, eye, and so on, of\nthe highest Being, and mentions for each of these meditations a special fruit.\nAnd the concluding explanation 'he who worships Vai _s_ vanara as a span long,\n&c.,' is merely meant to gather up into one, as it were, the preceding\nmeditations on the parts of Vai _s_ vanara.--Another Purvapakshin holds that\nthis very concluding passage enjoins a further meditation on Vai _s_ vanara in\nhis collective aspect, in addition to the previously enjoined meditations\n\np. 678\n\non his limbs; for that passage states a separate result, 'he eats food in all\nworlds,' &c. Nor does this destroy the unity of the whole section. The case is\nanalogous to that of the meditation on 'plenitude' (bhuman; _Kh_. Up. VII,\n23). There, in the beginning, separate meditations are enjoined on name, and\nso on, with special results of their own; and after that a meditation is\nenjoined on bhuman, with a result of its own, 'He becomes a Self-ruler,' &c.\nThe entire section really refers to the meditation on bhuman; but all the same\nthere are admitted subordinate meditations on name, and so on, and a special\nresult for each.--These views are set aside by the Sutra, 'There is pre-\neminence of plenitude,' i.e. there is reason to assume that Vai _s_ vanara in\nhis fulness, i.e. in his collective aspect, is meant; since we apprehend unity\nof the entire section. From the beginning of the section it is manifest that\nwhat the _Ri_ shis desire to know is the Vai _s_ anara Self; it is that Self\nwhich A _s_ vapati expounds to them as having the Universe for his body, and\nin agreement therewith the last clause of his teaching intimates that the\nintuition of Brahman (which is none other than the Vai _s_ vanara Self)--which\nis there characterised as the food of all worlds, all beings, all Selfs--is\nthe fruit of the meditation on Vai _s_ vanara. This summing up proves the\nwhole section to deal with the same subject. And on the basis of this\nknowledge we determine that what the text says as to meditations on the\nseparate members of the Vai _s_ anara Self and their special results is merely\nof the nature of explanatory comment (anuvada) on parts of the meditation on\nthe collective Self.--This decision is arrived at as in the case of the\nsacrifice. For to the injunction of certain sacrifices--such as 'Let a man, on\nthe birth of a son, offer a cake on twelve potsherds to Vai _s_ vanara'--the\ntext similarly adds remarks on parts of the oblation, 'there is an oblation on\neight potsherds,' and so on.--The meditation therefore has to be performed on\nthe entire Vai _s_ vanara Self only, not on its parts. This, moreover,\nScripture itself intimates, in so far, namely, as declaring the evil\nconsequences of meditation on parts of the Self only, 'your head would have\n\np. 679\n\nfallen off if you had not come to me'; 'you would have become blind,' and so\non. This also shows that the reference to the text enjoining meditations on\nname, &c., proves nothing as to our passage. For there the text says nothing\nas to disadvantages connected with those special meditations; it only says\nthat the meditation on plenitude (bhuman) has a more excellent result. The\nsection, therefore, although really concerned with enjoining the meditation on\nthe bhuman, at the same time means to declare that the special meditations\nalso are fruitful; otherwise the meditation on the bhuman could not be\nrecommended, for the reason that it has a more excellent result than the\npreceding meditations.--The conclusion, therefore, is that the text enjoins a\nmeditation on the collective Vai _s_ vanara Self only.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'the pre-eminence of plenitude.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 56.
