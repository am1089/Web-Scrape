Come hither, Maruts, on your chariots charged with lightning, resounding\nwith beautiful songs [1](sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:1:1), stored with spears, and\nwinged with horses! Fly [3](sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:1:3) to us like birds, with\nyour best food [2](sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:1:2), you mighty ones!\n\n2\\. They come gloriously on their red, or, it may be, on their tawny horses\nwhich hasten their chariots. He who holds the axe [1](sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:2:1)\nis brilliant like gold;--with the tire [2](sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:2:2) of the\nchariot they have struck the earth.\n\n3\\. On your bodies there are daggers for beauty; may they stir up our minds\n[1](sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:3:1) as they stir up the forests. For yourselves, O\nwell-born Maruts, the vigorous (among you) shake [2](sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:3:2)\nthe stone (for distilling Soma).\n\n4\\. Days went round you and came back [1](sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:4:1), O hawks,\nback to this prayer, and to this sacred rite; the Gotamas making prayer with\nsongs, pushed up the lid of the well (the cloud) for to drink.\n\n5\\. No such hymn [1](sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:5:1) was ever known as this which\nGotama sounded for you, O Maruts, when he saw you on golden wheels, wild boars\n[2](sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:5:2) rushing about with iron tusks.\n\n6\\. This comforting speech rushes sounding towards you, like the speech of a\nsuppliant: it rushed freely from our hands as our speeches are wont to do.\n\np. 170\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Gotama, the son of Rahuga _n_ a. The metre varies.\nVerses 1 and 6 are put down as Prastara-pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti, i. e. as 12 + 12 + 8 + 8. By\nmerely counting the syllables, and dissolving semivowels, it is just possible\nto get twenty-four syllables in the first line of verses 1 and 6. The old\nmetricians must have scanned verse 1:\n\na\xcc\x84 vi\xcc\x84d\xcc\x86yu\xcc\x84nma\xcc\x84t-bhi\xcc\x84 _h_ ma\xcc\x86ru\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _h_ su\xcc\x86-a\xcc\x84rkai\xcc\x84 _h_  \nra\xcc\x86the\xcc\x84bhi\xcc\x84 _h_ ya\xcc\x84ta \xcd\xa1\xcc\x84 _ri_ sh _t_ i\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84t-bhi\xcc\x86 _h_ a\xcc\x84 _s_ va\xcc\x86-pa\xcc\x84r _n_ ai\xcc\x84\n_h_.\n\n[paragraph continues] Again verse 6:\n\ne\xcc\x84sha\xcc\x84 sy\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84 va\xcc\x84 _h_ ma\xcc\x86ru\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _h_ a\xcc\x86nu\xcc\x86-bha\xcc\x84rtri\xcc\x84  \npra\xcc\x86ti\xcc\x84 sto\xcc\x84bha\xcc\x86ti\xcc\x86 va\xcc\x84gha\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _h_ na\xcc\x86 va\xcc\x84n\xcc\x86i\xcc\x84.\n\n[paragraph continues] But the general character of these lines shows that they\nwere intended for hendecasyllabics, each ending in a bacchius, though even\nthen they are not free from irregularities. The first verse would scan:\n\na\xcc\x84 vi\xcc\x84dy\xcc\x86u\xcc\x84nma\xcc\x84t-bhi\xcc\x84 _h_ ma\xcc\x86ru\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _h_ su\xcc\x86-a\xcc\x84rkai\xcc\x84 _h_  \nra\xcc\x86the\xcc\x84bhi\xcc\x84 _h_ ya\xcc\x84ta \xcd\xa1\xcc\x84 _ri_ sh _t_ i\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84t-(bhi\xcc\x86 _h_ ) a\xcc\x84sva\xcc\x86-pa\xcc\x84r _n_ ai\xcc\x84\n_h_.\n\n[paragraph continues] And verse 6:\n\ne\xcc\x84sha\xcc\x84 sy\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84, va\xcc\x84 _h_ ma\xcc\x86ru\xcc\x86ta _h_ \xcd\xa1\xcc\x84anu\xcc\x86-bha\xcc\x84rtri\xcc\x84  \npra\xcc\x86ti\xcc\x84 sto\xcc\x84bha\xcc\x86ti\xcc\x86 va\xcc\x84gha\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _h_ na\xcc\x86 va\xcc\x84 _n_ i\xcc\x84.\n\n[paragraph continues] Our only difficulty would be the termination bhi _h_ of\n_ri_ sh _t_ imat-bhi _h_. I cannot adopt Professor Kuhn's suggestion to drop\nthe Visarga of bhi _h_ and change i into y (Beitrage, vol. iv, p. 198), for\nthis would be a license without any parallel. It is different with sa _h_ ,\noriginally sa, or with feminines in i _h_ , where parallel forms in i are\nintelligible. The simplest correction would be to read ra\xcc\x86the\xcc\x84bhi\xcc\x84 _h_ ya\xcc\x84ta\n\xcd\xa1\xcc\x84 _ri_ sh _t_ i\xcc\x86-ma\xcc\x84nta _h_ \xcd\xa1\xcc\x84a _s_ va\xcc\x86-pa\xcc\x84r _n_ ai _h_. One might urge in\nsupport of this reading that in all other passages where _ri_ sh _t_ imat\noccurs, it refers to the Maruts themselves, and never to their chariots. Yet\nthe difficulty remains, how could so simple a reading have been replaced by a\nmore difficult one?\n\np. 171\n\nIn the two Gayatri padas which follow I feel equally reluctant to alter. I\ntherefore scan\n\na\xcc\x84 va\xcc\x84rshi\xcc\x84sh _th_ a\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84 na\xcc\x86 _h_ i\xcc\x86sha\xcc\x84 va\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84 _h_ na\xcc\x86 pa\xcc\x84pt\xcc\x85\xcc\x86a\xcc\x85t\xcc\x85\xcc\x86a\nsu\xcc\x86-ma\xcc\x84ya\xcc\x84 _h_ ,\n\ntaking the dactyl of paptata as representing a spondee, and admitting the\nexceptional bacchius instead of the amphimacer at the end of the line.\n\nThe last line of verse 6 should be scanned:\n\na\xcc\x86sto\xcc\x84bha\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84t v _ri_ \xcc\x86tha \xcd\xa1\xcc\x84asa\xcc\x86m\xcc\x84 a\xcc\x86nu\xcc\x84 sva\xcc\x86dha\xcc\x84m ga\xcc\x86bha\xcc\x84sty\xcc\x86o\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nThere are two other verses in this hymn where the metre is difficult. In the\nlast pada of verse 5 we have seven syllables instead of eleven. Again, I say,\nit would be most easy to insert one of the many tetrasyllabic epithets of the\nMaruts. But this would have been equally easy for the collectors of the Veda.\nNow the authors of the Anukrama _n_ is distinctly state that this fifth verse\nis vira _d_ rupa, i. e. that one of its padas consists of eight syllables. How\nthey would have made eight syllables out of vi-dhavata _h_ varahun does not\nappear, but at all events they knew that last pada to be imperfect. The rhythm\ndoes not suffer by this omission, as long as we scan vi\xcc\x86-dha\xcc\x84va\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _h_\nva\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x84hu\xcc\x84n.\n\nLastly, there is the third pada of the second verse, rukma _h_ na _k_ itra _h_\nsvadhiti-van. It would not be possible to get eleven syllables out of this,\nunless we admitted vyuha not only in sv\xcc\x86a\xcc\x86dhi\xcc\x86ti\xcc\x86va\xcc\x84n or sv\xcc\x86a\xcc\x86dhi\xcc\x86ti\xcc\x84-va\xcc\x84n,\nbut also in _k_ i\xcc\x86tra\xcc\x86 _h_ \xcc\x84. Kuhn (Beitrage, vol. iv, p. 192) proposes to\nscan rukmau na _k_ itara _h_ svadhitivan. Nothing would be easier than to\ninsert esham after _k_ itra _h_ , but the question occurs again, how could\nesham be lost, or why, if by some accident it had been lost, was not so\nobvious a correction made by _S_ aunaka and Katyayana?\n\nNo verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Alluding to the music of the Maruts, and not to the splendour of the\nlightning which is mentioned before. See Wolf, Beitrage zur Deutschen\nMythologie, vol. ii, p. 137. 'Das Ross and den Wagen des Gottes begleitet\nmunterer Hornerschall, entweder stosst er selbst ins Horn,\n\np. 172\n\noder sein Gefolge. Oft vernimmt man auch eine liebliche Musik, der keine auf\nErden gleich kommt (Mullenhof, 582). Das wird das Pfeifen and Heulen des\nSturmes sein, nur in idealisirter Art.' Ibid. p. 158.\n\nNote 2. Varshish _th_ a, which is generally explained as the superlative of v\n_ri_ ddha, old (Pa _n_. VI, 4, 157), has in most passages of the Rig-veda the\nmore general meaning of strong or excellent: VI, 47, 9. isham a\xc2\xb4 vakshi isha\xc2\xb4m\nvarshish _th_ am; III, 13, 7 (vasu); III, 26, 8 (ratna); III, 16, 3 (rai); IV,\n31, 15; VIII, 46, 24 ( _s_ rava _h_ ); IV, 22, 9 (n _ri_ m _n_ a); V, 67, 1\n(kshatra); VI, 45, 31 (murdhan). In some passages, however, it may be taken in\nthe sense of oldest (I, 37, 6; V, 7, 1), though by no means necessarily.\nVarshish _th_ a is derived in reality from v _r i_shan, in the sense of\nstrong, excellent. See note to I, 85, 12, page [144](sbe3222.htm#page_144).\n\nNote 3. Paptata, the second person plural of the imperative of what is\ncommonly, though without much reason, called the aorist of the causative of\npat. It is curiously like the Greek \xcf\x80\xce\xaf\xcf\x80\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xcf\x84\xce\xb5, but it has the meaning of flying\nrather than falling; see Curtius, Grundzuge, p. 190. Two other forms formed on\nthe same principle occur in the Rig-veda, papta _h_ and paptan:\n\nII, 31, 1. pra yat vaya _h_ na paptan.\n\nThat they may fly to us like birds.\n\nVI, 63, 6. pra vam vaya _h_ --anu paptan.\n\nMay your birds fly after you.\n\nX, 95, 15. pururava _h_ ma\xc2\xb4 m _ri_ tha _h_ ma\xc2\xb4 pra papta _h_.\n\nPururavas, do not die, do not go away!\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Though svadhiti-van does not occur again, it can only mean he who\nholds the axe, or, it may be, the sword or the thunderbolt, the latter\nparticularly, if Indra is here intended. Svadhiti signifies axe:\n\nIII, 2, 10. sva-dhitim na te _g_ ase.\n\nThey adorned Agni like an axe to shine or to cut.\n\nThe svadhiti is used by the butcher, I, 162, 9; 18; 20; and by the wood-cutter\nor carpenter, III, 8, 6; 11; X, 89, 7, &c. Roth (s. v.) takes svadhiti as\nmeaning also a tree,\n\np. 173\n\npossibly the oak, and he translates svadhitivan in our passage by a chariot\nmade of the wood of the Svadhiti tree. In RV. IX, 96, 6, svadhitir vananam may\nwell mean 'the strong axe among woods,' the axe being naturally made of the\nstrongest wood. In V, 32, 10, a devi\xc2\xb4 svadhiti _h_ is mentioned, possibly the\nlightning, the companion of Indra and the Maruts.\n\nNote 2. The tire of the chariot of the Maruts is frequently mentioned. It was\nconsidered not only as an essential part of their chariot, but likewise as\nuseful for crushing the enemy:\n\nV, 52, 9. uta pavya\xc2\xb4 rathanam adrim bhindanti o _g_ asa.\n\nThey cut the mountain (cloud) with the tire of their chariots.\n\nI, 166, 10. pavishu kshura\xc2\xb4 _h_ adhi.\n\nOn their tires are sharp edges.\n\nIn V, 31, 5, tires are mentioned without horses and chariot, which were turned\nby Indra against the Dasyus (I, 64, 11). I doubt, however, whether in India or\nelsewhere the tires or the wheels of chariots were ever used as weapons of\nattack, as detached from the chariot; (see M. M., On Pavirava, in Beitrage zur\nVergleichenden Sprachforschung, vol. iii, p. 447.) If we translate the\nfigurative language of the Vedic poets into matter-of-fact terms, the tires of\nthe chariots of the Maruts may be rendered by thunderbolts; yet by the poets\nof the Veda, as by the ancient people of Germany, thunder was really supposed\nto be the noise of the chariot of a god, and it was but a continuation of the\nsame belief that the sharp wheels of that chariot were supposed to cut and\ncrush the clouds; (see M. M., loc. cit., p. 444.)\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. That the va\xc2\xb4 _s_ is are small weapons, knives or daggers, we saw\nbefore, p. 71. Saya _n_ a here explains va\xc2\xb4 _s_ i by a weapon commonly called\nara, or an awl. In X, 101, 10, va\xc2\xb4 _s_ is are mentioned, made of stone, a _s_\nman-mayi.\n\nThe difficulty begins with the second half. Medha\xc2\xb4, as here written in the\nPada text, could only be a plural of\n\np. 174\n\na neuter medha, but such a neuter does nowhere exist in the Veda. We only find\nthe masculine medha, sacrifice, which is out of the question here, on account\nof its accent. Hence the passage III, 58, 2, urdhva\xc2\xb4 _h_ bhavanti pitara-iva\nmedha _h_ , is of no assistance, unless we alter the accent. The feminine\nmedha\xc2\xb4 means will, thought, prayer: I, 18, 6; II, 34, 7; IV, 33, 10; V, 27, 4;\n42, 13; VII, 104, 6; VIII, 6, 10; 52, 9; IX, 9, 9; 26, 3; 32, 6; 65, 16; 107,\n25; X, 91, 8. The construction does not allow us to take medha\xc2\xb4 as a Vedic\ninstrumental instead of medhaya, nor does such a form occur anywhere else in\nthe Rig-veda. Nothing remains, I believe, but to have recourse to conjecture,\nand the addition of a single Visarga in the Pada would remove all difficulty.\nIn the next line, if tuvi-dyumna\xc2\xb4sa _h_ be the subject, it would signify the\npriests. This, however, is again without any warrant from the Rig-veda, where\ntuvi-dyumna is always used as an epithet of gods. I therefore take it as\nreferring to the Maruts, as an adjective in the nominative, following the\nvocatives maruta _h_ su- _g_ ata _h_. The conception that the Maruts stir up\nthe forests is not of unfrequent occurrence in the Rig-veda cf. I, 171, 3.\nThat urdhva is used of the mind, in the sense of roused, may be seen in I,\n119, 2; 134, I; 144, 1; VII, 64, 4. The idea in the poet's mind seems to have\nbeen that the thunderbolts of the Maruts rouse up men to prayer as they stir\nthe tops of the forest trees. Ludwig takes medha, masc., in the sense of\nlance, comparing it with Icelandic meidhr, but the two words cannot well be\nthe same. Possibly vana may be meant for lances: 'May they raise our minds,\nlike lances;' see note to I, 171, 3.\n\nNote 2. On dhan in the sense of to agitate, see B. and R. s. v. The shaking of\nthe stone may be the shaking of the stone for distilling the heavenly Soma or\nthe rain; but adri may also be meant for the thunderbolt. I now take\ntuvidyumna for an adjective referring to the Maruts, because it is a divine\nrather than a human epithet. Still, the passage is doubtful.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The first question is, which is the subject, ahani\n\np. 175\n\nor g _r i_dhra _h_? If g _r i_dhra _h_ were the subject, then we should have\nto translate it by the eager poets, and take ahani in the sense of vi _s_ va\nahani. The sense then might be: 'Day by day did the eager poets sing around\nyou this prayer.' There would be several objections, however, to this\nrendering. First, g _r i_dhra _h_ , though metaphorically applicable to poets,\nnever occurs again as signifying poets or priests. One passage only could be\nquoted in support, IX, 97, 57, kavaya _h_ na g _r i_dhra _h_ (not g _ri_ dhra\xc2\xb4\n_h_ ), like greedy poets. But even here, if indeed the translation is right,\nthe adjective is explained by kavi, and does not stand by itself. Secondly,\nahani by itself is never used adverbially in the sense of day after day. The\nonly similar passage that might be quoted is III, 34, 10, and that is very\ndoubtful. To take ahani as a totally different word, viz. as a \\+ hani,\nwithout ceasing, without wearying, would be too bold in the present state of\nVedic interpretation. If then we take ahani as the subject, g _r i_dhra _h_\nwould have to be taken as a vocative, and intended for the Maruts. Now, it is\nperfectly true, that by itself g _r i_dhra, hawk, does not occur again as a\nname of the Maruts, but _s_ yena, hawk, and particularly a strong hawk (IX,\n96, 6), is not only a common simile applied to the Maruts, but is actually\nused as one of their names:\n\nVII, 56, 3. abhi sva-pu\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ mitha _h_ vapanta va\xc2\xb4ta-svanasa _h_ _s_ yena\xc2\xb4\n_h_ asp _ri_ dhran.\n\nThey plucked each other with their beaks (?), the hawks, rushing like the\nwind, strove together.\n\nAgu _h_ might be the aorist of gai, to sing, or of ga, to go:\n\nI, 174, 8. sana ta\xc2\xb4 te indra navya _h_ a\xc2\xb4 agu _h_.\n\nNew poets, O Indra, sang these thy old deeds.\n\nIII, 56, 2. ga\xc2\xb4va _h_ a\xc2\xb4 agu _h_.\n\nThe cows approached.\n\nIf then the sense of the first line is, 'Days went and came back to you,' the\nnext question is whether we are to extend the construction to the next words,\nima\xc2\xb4m dhiyam varkarya\xc2\xb4m _k_ a devi\xc2\xb4m, or whether these words are to be joined\nto k _ri_ _n_ vanta _h_ , like brahma. The meaning of\n\np. 176\n\nvarkarya\xc2\xb4 is, of course, unknown. Saya _n_ a's interpretation as 'what is to\nbe made by means of water' is merely etymological, and does not help us much.\nIt is true that the object of the hymn, which is addressed to the Maruts, is\nrain, and that literally varkarya\xc2\xb4 might be explained as 'that the effect of\nwhich is rain.' But this is far too artificial a word for Vedic poets.\nPossibly there was some other word that had become unintelligible and which,\nby a slight change, was turned into varkarya\xc2\xb4, in order to give the meaning of\nrain-producing. It might have been _k_ arkarya, glorious, or the song of a\npoet called Varkara, or, as Ludwig suggests, V _ri_ kari. The most likely\nsupposition is that varkarya\xc2\xb4 was the name given to some famous hymn, some\npaean or song of triumph belonging to the Gotamas, possibly to some verses of\nthe very hymn before us. In this case the epithet devi\xc2\xb4 would be quite\nappropriate, for it is frequently used for a sacred or sacrificial song: IV,\n43, 2: devi\xc2\xb4m su-stutim; III, i 8, 3. ima\xc2\xb4m dhiyam _s_ ata-seyaya devi\xc2\xb4m. See,\nhowever, the note to verse 6.\n\nThe purport of the whole line would then be that many days have gone for the\nMaruts as well as for the famous hymn once addressed to them by Gotama, or, in\nother words, that the Gotamas have long been devoted to the Maruts, an idea\nfrequently recurring in the hymns of the Veda, and, in our case, carried on in\nthe next verse, where it is said that the present hymn is like one that Gotama\ncomposed when he saw the Maruts or spoke of them as wild boars with iron\ntusks. The pushing up the lid of the well for to drink, means that they\nobtained rain from the cloud, which is here, as before, represented as a\ncovered well.\n\nSee another explanation in Haug, \xc3\x9cber die ursprungliche Bedeutung des Wortes\nBrahma, 1868, p. 5.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Yo _g_ ana commonly means a chariot:\n\nVI, 62, 6. are _n_ u-bhi _h_ yo _g_ anebhi _h_ bhu _g_ anta.\n\nYou who possess dustless chariots.\n\nVIII, 72, 6. a _s_ va-vat yo _g_ anam b _ri_ hat.\n\np. 177\n\nThe great chariot with horses.\n\nIt then became the name for a distance to be accomplished without unharnessing\nthe horses, just as the Latin jugum, a yoke, then a juger of land, 'quod uno\njugo boum uno die exarari posset,' Pliny XVIII, 3, 3, 9.\n\nIn our passage, however, yo _g_ ana means a hymn, lit. a composition, which is\nclearly its meaning in\n\nVIII, 90, 3. brahma te indra girva _n_ a _h_ kriyante anatidbhuta, ima\xc2\xb4 _g_\nushasva hari-a _s_ va yo _g_ ana indra ya\xc2\xb4 te amanmahi.\n\nUnequalled prayers are made for thee, praiseworthy Indra; accept these hymns\nwhich we have devised for thee, O Indra with bright horses!\n\nNote 2. Vara\xc2\xb4hu has here the same meaning as varaha, wild boar (VIII, 77, 10;\nX, 28, 4). It occurs once more, I, 121, 11, as applied to V _ri_ tra, who is\nalso called varaha, I, 61, 7; X, 99, 6. In X, 67, 7, v _r i_sha-bhi _h_\nvara\xc2\xb4hai _h_ (with the accent on the penultimate) is intended for the Maruts\na. Except in this passage, varaha has the accent on the last syllable. In IX,\n97, 7, varaha is applied to Soma.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nThis last verse is almost unintelligible to me. I give, however, the various\nattempts that have been made to explain it.\n\nWilson: This is that praise, Maruts, which, suited (to your merits), glorifies\nevery one of you. The speech of the priest has now glorified you, without\ndifficulty, with sacred verses, since (you have placed) food in our hands.\n\nBenfey: Dies Lied--Maruts!--das hinter euch emporstrebt, es klingt zuruck\ngleich eines Beters Stimme. Muhlos schuf solche Lieder er, entsprechend eurer\nArme Kraft. (Note: Der zum Himmel schallende Lobgesang findet seinen Widerhall\n(wirklich, 'bebt zuruck') in dem Sturmgeheul\n\np. 178\n\nder Maruts, welches mit dem Geheul des Betenden verglichen wird.)\n\nLudwig: Dises lied, o Marut, euch unterstutzend (aufnemend) als eines\npriesters braust euch entgegen, nachbrausen hat es gemacht ohne muhe in (die)\nder nahe die gottliche weise (ihrer) arme.\n\nMy own translation is to a great extent conjectural. It seems to me from verse\n3, that the poet offers both a hymn of praise and a libation of Soma. Possibly\nvarkarya in verse 4 might be taken in the sense of Soma-juice, and be derived\nfrom valkala, which in later Sanskrit means the bark of trees. In that case\nverse 5 would again refer to the hymn of Gotama, and verse 6 to the libation\nwhich is to accompany it. Anu-bhartri\xc2\xb4 does not occur again, but it can only\nmean what supports or refreshes, and therefore would be applicable to a\nlibation of Soma which supports the gods. The verb stobhati would well express\nthe rushing sound of the Soma, as in I, 168, 8, it expresses the rushing noise\nof the waters against the fellies of the chariots. The next line adds little\nbeyond stating that this libation of Soma rushes forth freely from the hands,\nthe gabhastis being specially mentioned in other passages where the crushing\nof the Soma-plant is described:\n\nIX, 71, 3. adri-bhi _h_ suta _h_ pavate gabhastyo _h_.\n\nThe Soma squeezed by the stones runs from the hands.\n\nThe translation would then be: O Maruts, this comforting draught (of Soma)\nrushes towards you, like the speech of a suppliant; it rushed freely from our\nhands, as our draughts (of Soma) are wont to do.\n\nOn svadha\xc2\xb4, see [p. 32](sbe3216.htm#page_32).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[177:a](sbe3225.htm#fr_105) See Genthe, Die Windgottheiten, 186 1, p.14;\nGrimm, Deutsche Mythologie, p. 689.
