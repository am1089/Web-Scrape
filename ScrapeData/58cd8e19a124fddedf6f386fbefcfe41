The King said :-- O Bhagavan! Kindly narrate to me in detail now the\nmethods how to serve and worship the Goddess and the Mantrams that are used on\nsuch occasions.\n\n\n\n2-12. The Ri _s_ i said :-- O King! I am now describing the method how to\nworship the Goddess. Hear. This leads to the fulfilment of all desires, to the\nliberation from one\xc2\x92s bondage, to self-realisation and to the destruction of\nall miseries. The worshipper has to perform his bath; then putting on a white\ncloth, he will have to perform his Vaidik and Tantrik Sandhya; then he should,\nwith his heart controlled, perform his \xc3\x82chamana ceremony and select a good\nauspicious site for his own Pooja purposes. Next he should plaster the site\nwith cow-dung and spread his sacred carpet (\xc3\x82sana) whereon he is to take his\nseat with a cheerful mind and sip water for \xc3\x82chamana three times. Then he is\nto collect the articles for worship according to\n\n\n\np. 474\n\n\n\nhis best capacity and place them duly in their respective positions. He is to\nperform Pra _n_ ayama (regulate his breath); and then follows the\nBhuta-S\xc2\x92uddhi, the purification of the old and the formation of the celestial\nbody and Jiva-S\xc2\x92uddhi by which the Sadhaka becomes the Devata-maya; he then\nproceeds to Matrika Nyasa (i.e., setting mentally in their several places in\nthe six Chakras and then externally by physical action the letters of the\nalphabet which form the different parts of the body of the Devata. He then\nplaces his hand on different parts of his body, uttering distinctly at the\nsame time the appropriate Matrika for that part).\n\n\n\nBhuta-S\xc2\x92uddhi :-- Dissolve earth into water, water into fire, fire into air,\nair into ether; ether into Ahamkara, Ahamkara into Ma _h_ at and Ma _h_ at\ninto Prakriti, the final Cause. This process is called Bhuta-S\xc2\x92uddhi.\n\n\n\nHe is to mention then the time, date, tithi, and month of the year and make\nhis Sankalpa; then he will have to assign to the different parts of his body\nthe Matrika Mantrams duly as well as his own Mantram; next he is to meditate\nin his own body the seat of the different Devatas and do the internal worship.\nHe is to breathe life into the Deity outside to be worshipped as well as\nwithin himself to be meditated and worshipped; then he is to do the same with\nthe articles for worship and purify them by sprinkling with water and Astra or\nPha _t_ Mantram, thus removing all sources of obstacles that are likely to\ninterfere with the act. Next, on an auspicious copper plate, he is to draw\ninside a six-angled (hexagonal) figure (two triangles crossing each other with\ntheir vertices one upward and the other below) with white sandal paste or with\neight perfumed things and outside this figure, an octagonal figure of eight\npetals; outside this he is to draw the boundary lines that is called the\nBhupura. On each of the eight petals he is to write each letter of the nine-\nlettered Vija (Seed) Mantram and the ninth letter in the central ovum. Next by\nthe Mantram by which breath is infused or by the Vedic Mantram he will have to\nplace the Yantra in the proper position and then worship the \xc3\x82dhara S\xc2\x92akti\n(the vital Force) in the central ovum and the holy seat with the Pi _t_ ha\nMantrams. He will have to invoke the Devi, uttering the Seed Mantram over a\ngolden plate or figure and carefully worship Her by offering seats and other\narticles duly as enunciated in the Yamala Tantras, etc. Then he will have to\nperform the six-fold worship of the Ga _n_ as in the six angles and worship\nIndra, etc., and Vajra and others in the Bhupura (the boundary) and thus\nfinish the Pooja of the Yantra. (For the Pooja see the Prapancha Sara.) Note\n:-- Bhupura is what is thought over outside front or in the beginning. Here\nthe Ga _n_ a Devatas are first thought over and worshipped. Worship outside,\nworship inside and See the Deity in and out, everywhere and be free is the\nmotto of the worship. In the absence of the Yantra, one\n\n\n\np. 475\n\n\n\nwill have to make a metalled image of Bhagavati and worship Her with the\ngreatest caution with the Mantras as expounded by S\xc2\x92iva in the Tantrams (of\nJamala and others). Note :-- Yantra is that which restrains. This human body\nis the Yantra. And its imitation is placed outside in various shapes and\nfigures. The Yantra is the mystical diagram used by the devotees for worship.\nOr one may use the Vaidik Mantrams in worshipping the Deity in accordance with\nthe prescribed rules and with his mind controlled; then, merged in meditation,\none is to mutter silently (perform the Japam of) the nine-lettered Mantram.\n(The Mantram is Krim Dak _s_ i _n_ e Kalike Svaha). Japam (muttering or\nrepeating silently the Mantram) is of two kinds :-- Nitya (daily) and\nPauras\xc2\x92charanik (repetition of the name of the deity accompanied with burnt\nofferings). In the Nitya Japam, Nitya Homas are performed and in the\noccasional Pauras\xc2\x92charanik Japam, one tenth of this is offerred; Abhi _s_ eka,\ntoo, is one-tenth of this Homa; Tarpa _n_ am is one-tenth of Abhi _s_ eka and\nthe feeding of the Brahma _n_ as is one-tenth of what is done in the Tarpa _n_\nam. O King! Thus completing the Japam one is to read daily the Cha _nd_ i (do\nthe Cha _nd_ ipa _t_ ha) where the three glorious deeds of the Devi are\nnarrated; next he will have to allow the Deity invoked to depart to Her own\nplace. The Navaratra Vrata (nine night vow) is next to be observed according\nto the proper rites and ceremonies. Hrim Mahi _s_ a Mardinyai Svaha is the\nMantra.\n\n\n\n13-31. In the bright fortnight of the month of \xc3\x82svin or Chaitra, is to be\nobserved the fasting of the Navaratra by those who desire for their own\nwelfare. Homas are to be offered, many in number, and Mantrams are to be\nrecited, the same as in one\xc2\x92s own Mantram, good Payasam with sugar, ghee, and\nhoney mixed is to be offered in this ceremony. Goat meat, or holy leaves of\nthe Bel tree, or red Karavir flowers or til (sesamum seed) mixed with honey\ncan be used instead in the Homa ceremony. The special days for the worship of\nthe Devi are the eighth, ninth, or fourteenth day (tithi) of the half month.\nThe feeding of the Brahmi _n_ s must be done on each occasion. O King! Thus\nthe poor become wealthy, the diseased get cured, and the persons that have no\nissue get obedient and well qualified sons. The King, expelled from his\nkingdom, gets back by the grace of Maha Maya, dominion over the whole earth\nand becomes able to destroy all those enemies of his, by whom he was before\nvanquished, when he worships the Devi. The persons, desirous of learning, get\nundoubtedly the learning honourable and auspicious, provided he worships the\nDevi with his senses restrained. Persons of all castes, Brahmi _n_ s, K _s_\natriyas, Vais\xc2\x92yas or S\xc2\x92udras can become masters of all pleasures and happiness\nprovided they worship with devotion the Devi, the Preserver of the World (the\nJagaddhatri). A man or woman whoever\n\n\n\np. 476\n\n\n\nperforms the Navaratra vow always full of devotion, gets all the desired\nfruits. Whoever celebrates the holy Navaratra ceremony in the bright fortnight\nof the month of \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92vin with his heart full of the thought of the Devi, gets\nall his desired fruits. O King! Now I am describing the rites and ceremonies;\nhere a square raised platform or altar is to be made according to the\nprescribed rules; a water-jar is then to be placed on it with the Vedic\nmantrams and due rites and ceremonies. One will have to make a beautiful\nYantra according to the previously laid rules and the water-jar is to be\nplaced on it; then spread the beautiful Yava grains all around the jar. An\nawning or pandal is to be erected over the altar and the place of worship, and\nthe site is to be decorated with flowers. Lights and Dhupas, incense and\nperfumes are then to be used in the hall of the Cha _nd_ ika Devi. O King! The\nDevi is to be worshipped thrice; morning, midday and evening; no miserliness\nis to be shown in spending wealth for this purpose. Light, dhup, good presents\nof rice and other edibles, flowers, and fruits of various kinds are to be\noffered in this worship of the Devi; the chanting of the hymns of the Vedas,\nsongs, and music with the various instruments are to be done and a grand\nfestivity is to be made. Moreover, note this carefully that virgins are to be\nworshipped duly with sandal, ornaments, clothings, various edibles, sweet\nscented oil, and beautiful garlands. (This worship of the virgins is one of\nthe essentials.) Thus completing the worship of the Devi, Homa is to be done\nduly with Mantrams and other necessary articles on the eighth or the ninth\ntithi. Lastly the Brahmi _n_ s are to be fed duly; then the worshipper is to\ntake his first meal after fasting (i.e., make para _n_ am) on the tenth day;\nthen presents and various articles are to be offered to the Brahmi _n_ ,\naccording to one\xc2\x92s might and with devotion.\n\n\n\n32-44. O King! Any man, or any chaste married woman or a chaste widow whoever\nperforms thus the Navaratra Vrata gets in this world all the desired fruits\nand enjoys all sorts of enjoyments and gets unbounded happiness and after\ndeath goes to the highest place. And if, owing to some cause or other, he has\nto take his birth again in this world, he would be born in an excellent family\nand would become endowed with good conduct and qualifications and get the\nunflinching devotion towards the Ambika Devi. O King! I have thus described to\nyou the rules of the Navaratra ceremony; this vow is the best of all; highest\nand greatest pleasures and happinesses are obtained in worshipping thus the\nauspicious Maha Maya. O King! Better worship Cha _nd_ ika duly according to\nthe prescribed rules; then you would be able, by Her grace, to conquer all\nyour enemies and you will regain your excellent dominion, unshaken by any, and\nyou will get again the highest pleasure and happiness when you\n\n\n\np. 477\n\n\n\nwill be reunited with your wife and sons in your own palace; there is no doubt\nin this. O Vais\xc2\x92ya! You, too, better worship the same Maha Maya, the Goddess\nof the Universe, worshipping Whom leads to the fructification of all desires.\nYou will then be able to regain all your worldly pleasures in your own home\nand be respected by your relatives and acquaintances and finally, after your\ndeath, you will go to the holy abode of the Devi. There is no doubt in this.\nThose that do not worship the Devi, go to Naraka or hell; moreover they suffer\nmuch from various diseases in this world. Those that do not worship the Devi\nare always defeated by their enemies, are void of wife and sons, become stupid\nand suffer pains from their unsatisfied desires. And those that worship the\nPreservrix of this world with the Bel leaves, Karavira flowers, S\xc2\x92atapatra and\nChampaka flowers, that blessed man, devoted to the Devi, gets filled with all\nsorts of enjoyments. O King! What more can I say than this, that those who\nhave worshipped the Devi Bhavani with the Mantrams approved by the Nigama\nS\xc2\x92astras, those very persons get honour in this world and are filled with all\nsorts of power and wealth. Verily, they stand foremost in the rank of best\nmen, becoming the only repositories of all the best qualities in this world.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-fourth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the methods of the\nworship of the Devi in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 35](bk05ch35.htm)\n\n'
