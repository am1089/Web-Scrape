 \nWhere trees distil their balmy juice.  \nAnd fruit through all the year produce;  \nWhere shades with seasons ever fair  \nWith Chaitraratha may compare:  \nWhere trees whose sprays with fruit are bowed  \nRise like a mountain or a cloud.  \nThere, when you list, from time to time,  \nThe loaded trees may Lakshman climb,  \nOr from the shaken boughs supply  \nSweet fruit that may with Amrit vie.  \nThe onward path pursuing still  \nFrom wood to wood, from hill to hill,  \nYour happy eyes at length will rest  \nOn Pampa's lotus-covered breast.  \n\nHer banks with gentle slope descend,  \nNor stones nor weed the eyes offend,  \nAnd o'er smooth beds of silver sand  \nLotus and lily blooms expand.  \nThere swans and ducks and curlews play,  \nAnd keen-eyed ospreys watch their prey,  \nAnd from the limpid waves are heard  \nGlad notes of many a water-bird.  \nUntaught a deadly foe to fear  \nThey fly not when a man is near,  \nAnd fat as balls of butter they  \nWill, when you list, your hunger stay.  \nThen Lakshman with his shafts will take  \nThe fish that swim the brook and lake,  \nRemove each bone and scale and fin,  \nOr strip away the speckled skin,  \nAnd then on iron skewers broil  \nFor thy repast the savoury spoil.  \nThou on a heap of flowers shalt rest  \nAnd eat the meal his hands have dressed  \nThere shalt thou lie on Pampa's brink.  \nAnd Lakshman's hand shall give thee drink,  \nFilling a lotus leaf with cool  \nPure water from the crystal pool,  \nTo which the opening blooms hare lent  \nThe riches of divinest scent.  \nBeside thee at the close of day  \nWill Lakshman through the woodland stray,  \nAnd show thee where the monkeys sleep  \nIn caves beneath the mountain steep.  \nLurd-voiced as bulls they forth will burst  \nAnd seek the flood, oppressed by thirst;  \nThen rest a while, their wants supplied,  \nTheir well-fed bands on Pampa's side.  \nThou roving there at eve shalt see  \nRich clusters hang on shrub and tree,  \nAnd Pampa flushed with roseate glow,  \nAnd at the view forget thy woe.  \nThere shalt thou mark with strange delight  \nEach loveliest flower that blooms by night,  \nWhile lily buds that shrink from day  \nTheir tender loveliness display.  \nIn that far wild no hand but thine  \nThose peerless flowers in wreaths shall twine:  \nImmortal in their changeless pride,  \nNe'er fade those blooms and ne'er are dried.  \nThere erst on holy thoughts intent  \nTheir days Matanga's pupils spent.  \nOnce for their master food they sought,  \nAnd store of fruit and berries brought.  \nThen as they laboured through the dell  \nFrom limb and brow the heat-drops fell:  \nThence sprang and bloomed those wondrous trees:  \nSuch holy power have devotees.  \nThus, from the hermits' heat-drops sprung,  \nTheir growth is ever fresh and young.  \nThere S'avari is dwelling yet,  \nWho served each vanished anchoret.  \n\np. 316  \n\nBeneath the shade of holy boughs  \nThat ancient votaress keeps her vows.  \nHer happy eyes on thee will fall,  \nO godlike prince, adored by all,  \nAnd she, whose life is pure from sin,  \nA blissful seat in heaven will win.  \nBut cross, O son of Raghu, o'er,  \nAnd stand on Pampa's western shore.  \nA tranquil hermitage that lies  \nDeep in the woods will meet thine eyes.  \nNo wandering elephants invade  \nThe stillness of that holy shade,  \nBut checked by saint Matanga's power  \nThey spare each consecrated bower.  \nThrough many an age those trees have stood  \nWorld-famous as Matanga's wood  \nStill, Raghu's son, pursue thy way:  \nThrough shades where birds are vocal stray,  \nFair as the blessed wood where rove  \nImmortal Gods, or Nandan's grove.  \nNear Pampa eastward, full in sight,  \nStands Rishyamuka's wood-crowned height.  \n'Tis hard to climb that towering steep  \nWhere serpents unmolested sleep.  \nThe free and bounteous, formed of old  \nBy Brahma, of superior mould,  \nWho sink when day is done to rest  \nReclining on that mountain crest,  \nWhat wealth or joy in dreams they view  \nAwaking find the vision true.  \nBut if a villain stained with crime  \nThat holy hill presume to climb,  \nThe giants in their fury sweep  \nFrom the hill top the wretch asleep.  \nThere loud and long is heard the loar  \nOf elephants on Pampa's shore.  \nWho near Matanga's dwelling stray  \nAnd in those waters bathe and play.  \nA while they revel by the flood,  \nTheir temples stained with streams like blood.  \nThen wander far away dispersed,  \nDark as huge clouds before they burst.  \nBut ere they part they drink their fill  \nOf bright pure water from the rill.  \nDelightful to the touch, where meet  \nScents of ail flowers divinely sweet,  \nThen speeding from the river side  \nDeep in the sheltering thicket hide.  \nThen bears and tigers shalt thou view  \nWhose soft skins show the sapphire's hue,  \nAnd silvan deer that wander, nigh  \nShall harmless from thy presence fly.  \nHigh in that mountains wooded side  \nIs a fair cavern deep and wide,  \nYet hard to enter: piles of rock  \nThe portals-of the cavern block.'  1  \n\nBy the eastern door a pool  \nGleams with broad waters fresh and cool,  \nWhere stores of roots and fruit abound,  \nAnd thick trees shade the grassy ground.  \nThis mountain cave the virtuous-souled  \nSugriva, and his Vanars hold,  \nAnd oft the mighty chieftain seeks  \nThe summits of those towering peaks,'  \n   Thus spake Kabandha. high in air  \nHis counsel to the royal pair,  \nStill on his neck that wreath he bore,  \nAnd radiance like the sun's he wore,  \nTheir eyes the princely brothers raised  \nAnd on that blissful being gazed:  \n'Behold, we go: no more delay;  \nBegin,' they cried,'thy heavenward way.'  \n'Depart,' Kabandha's voice replied,  \n'Pursue your search, and bliss betide.'  \n   Thus to the happy chiefs he said,  \nThen on his heavenward journey sped:  \n  Thus once again Kahandha won  \nA shape that glittered like the sun  \n   Without a spot or stain.  \nThus bade he Rama from the air  \nTo great Sugriva's side repair  \n   His friendly love to gain.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[316:1](ry272.htm#fr_522) Or as the commentator Titha says, S'ilapidhana,\nrock-covered, may be the name of the cavern.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXV.: Savari](ry273.htm)\n\n"
