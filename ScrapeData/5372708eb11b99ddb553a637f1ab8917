May we dwell in the favour of (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara. He indeed is a king,\nleading all beings to gloriousness [1](sbe46034.htm#an_1:98:1:1). As soon as\nborn from here he looks over this whole world. Vai _s_ vanara unites with the\nSun [2](sbe46034.htm#an_1:98:1:2).\n\n2\\. Agni who has been looked and longed for [1](sbe46034.htm#an_1:98:2:1) in\nHeaven, who has been looked for on Earth--he who has been looked for, has\nentered all herbs. May Agni Vai _s_ vanara, who has strongly been looked for,\nprotect us from harm by day and by night.\n\n3\\. Vai _s_ vanara! May this be true of thee: may wealth and liberal givers\nattend us! May Mitra and Varu _n_ a grant us this, may Aditi, the Sindhu, the\nEarth, and the Sky!\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 1 = VS. XXVI, 7; TS. I, 5, 11,\n3; MS.
