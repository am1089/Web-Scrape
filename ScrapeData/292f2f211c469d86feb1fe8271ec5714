D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 9\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\nThe following pages sketch in outline--and therefore inadequately--the most\nimportant elements in the series of ideas which, under the general name of\n_Ved \xc4\x81nta_, have been in one form or another the basis of all Indian thought\nworthy of the name. No attempt is made here either to justify or to refute\nthem. Their philosophic weakness is obvious; no less patent is the intensity\nof the longing for an intellectual resting-place, a "Rock of Ages," which has\ndriven millions of the most thoughtful Hindus to drown their soul\'s disquiet\nin the utterly blank abstraction of "Brahma."\n\nIn the main the Ved\xc4\x81nta agrees with the teaching of Parmenides and the early\nEleatics of his school, and has many points of contact with Plato\'s idealism.\nBut whereas the Greek philosophers were only professors, the Ved\xc4\x81nta has\nalways had a deep practical significance. Like the early Christian Church, it\npreached as highest consummation the renunciation of the world and\n\np. 10\n\nof self, passing in some of its phases into a religious self-surrender fully\nequal in completeness, if not superior, to that of European monasticism; and\neven as a purely intellectual force it has had an incalculable influence upon\nthe minds and characters of millions of Hindus in nearly every station of\ncivilised life. To discuss this issue is beyond the province of our book; it\nmust suffice to point to it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Vedanta, The Vedas\' End](brk04.htm)\n\n'
