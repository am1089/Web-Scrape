He then offers the Va _g_ aprasaviya 2 (set of fourteen\nlibations),--'va _g_ a' (strength, sustenance) means food (anna): it thus is\nan 'anna-prasaviya' for him, and it is food he thereby raises (pra-su) for him\n(Agni).\n\n9:3:4:22\\. For the gods, now that they had gratified him by that food, and\nconsecrated him by those objects of desire, (to wit) by that stream of wealth\n3, hereby gratified him once more; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer),\nnow that he has gratified him by that food, and consecrated him by those\nobjects of desire, that shower of wealth, hereby gratify him once more.\n\np. 224\n\n9:3:4:33\\. And, again, as to why he offers the Va _g_ aprasaviya. This, to be\nsure, is his (Agni's) Abhisheka. For, the gods, having gratified him by that\nfood, and consecrated him by those objects of desire, (to wit) by that shower\nof wealth, then by this (offering) consecrated him once more; and in like\nmanner does this (Sacrificer), having gratified him by that food, and\nconsecrated him by those objects of desire, that shower of wealth, hereby\nconsecrate him once more.\n\n9:3:4:44\\. It consists of (seeds of) all (kinds of) plants,--that which\nconsists of all plants is all food: he thus gratifies him with all food, and\nwith all food he thus consecrates him. Let him set aside one of these kinds of\nfood, and not eat thereof as long as he lives. With an udumbara (ficus\nglomerata) cup 1 and an udumbara dipping-spoon (he offers): the significance\nof these two has been explained. They are both four-cornered,--there are four\nquarters: he thus gratifies him with food from every quarter, and by means of\nfood from every quarter he thus consecrates him.\n\n9:3:4:55\\. And, again, as to why he performs the Va _g_ aprasaviya;--he\nthereby gratifies those same deities who have been consecrated by this very\nrite of consecration by which he is now about to be consecrated, and, thus\ngratified by offering, they grant him permission (to perform) this rite of\nconsecration, and, permitted by them, he becomes consecrated; for only he\nbecomes king whom the (other) kings allow to assume the royal dignity, but not\nhe whom\n\np. 225\n\nthey do not (allow to do so). Thus when he offers in the fire he consecrates\nAgni, and when he offers to these deities, he gratifies those gods who rule\nover this consecration ceremony.\n\n9:3:4:66\\. And, indeed, he offers here also the Partha 1 (oblations);--for the\ngods now desired, 'May we be consecrated even on this occasion by all the\nrites of consecration!' They were indeed consecrated on this occasion by all\nthe rites of consecration; and in like manner is the Sacrificer on this\noccasion consecrated by all the rites of consecration.\n\n9:3:4:77\\. Now these Partha (oblations) are the Va _g_ aprasaviya of the Ra\n_g_ asuya; and by offering these (oblations) he is consecrated by the Ra _g_\nasuya; and the first seven of the succeeding fourteen (Va _g_ aprasaviya\noblations) are the Va _g_ aprasaviya ceremony of the Va _g_ apeya 2: thus, by\noffering these he is consecrated by the Va _g_ apeya. And what other seven\nthere are, they belong to Agni (or, the Agni _k_ ayana): by offering these, he\nis consecrated by the Agni-consecration.\n\n9:3:4:88\\. He first offers those of the Ra _g_ asuya, then those of the Va _g_\napeya; for by performing the Ra _g_ asuya one becomes king (ra _g_ a) and by\nthe Va _g_ apeya emperor (samra _g_ ), and the position of king is (obtained)\nfirst, and thereafter that of\n\np. 226\n\nemperor 1: hence after performing the Va _g_ apeya, one could not perform the\nRa _g_ asuya,--it would be a descent, just as if one who is emperor were to\nbecome king.\n\n9:3:4:99\\. Those (seven Va _g_ aprasaviya oblations) of the fire-altar he\noffers last, for the Agni-consecration indeed is (equal to) all those rites of\nconsecration, and he who is consecrated by the Agni-consecration rite becomes\neverything, king and emperor: therefore he offers those of the fire-altar last\nof all.\n\n9:3:4:1010\\. He then anoints him on a black antelope skin,--for the black\nantelope skin is (a symbol of) the sacrifice: it is thus at the sacrifice that\nhe anoints him. On the hairy side (of the skin),--for the hairs are the\nmetres: on the metres he thus anoints him. On the left (north) side (of the\nfire-altar he anoints him): the significance of this (will be explained)\nfurther on. On (the skin laid down) with the neck-part towards the front, for\nthat (tends) godwards.\n\n9:3:4:1111\\. Some, however, anoint him on the right (south) side of the fire-\naltar, on the ground that it is from the right side that food is served, and\nthat they thus anoint him from the food-side. But let him not do so, for that\n(southern) region belongs to the Fathers, and quickly he goes to that region\nwhom they anoint in that way.\n\n9:3:4:1212\\. And some, indeed, anoint him on the \xc3\x82havaniya, on the ground that\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya is the world of heaven, and that they thus anoint him in the\nworld of heaven. But let him not do so, for that (\xc3\x82havaniya, the fire-altar,)\nis his (the Sacrificer's)\n\np. 227\n\ndivine body, and this (Sacrificer, or Sacrificer's real body) is his human\none: they thus attach that divine body of his to this his mortal body, if they\nanoint him in this way.\n\n9:3:4:1313\\. Let him anoint him on the left (north) side and nowhere else, for\nthat north-eastern region belongs to both gods and men: they thus anoint him\nwhilst seated and established in his own region, for he who is established in\nhis own seat suffers no injury.\n\n9:3:4:1414\\. One who has gained a position in the world should be anointed\nsitting, for one who has gained a position is seated, so to speak;--and one\nwho is striving to gain one standing, for one who wishes to gain a position,\nstands, so to speak. On a he-goat's skin should be anointed one desirous of\nprosperity, on a black-antelope skin one desirous of spiritual lustre, on both\n(kinds of skins) one desirous of both: that (skin) he spreads north of the\ntail (of the fire-altar) with its hair uppermost and its neck-part towards the\neast.\n\n9:3:4:1515\\. Close to the enclosing-stones 1: inasmuch as the black-antelope\nskin is close to the enclosing-stones, so that divine body of his is\nconsecrated on the black-antelope skin; and inasmuch as he is consecrated\nwhilst keeping hold of the fire-altar he is not cut off from that divine\nconsecration (of the Fire).\n\n9:3:4:1616\\. He anoints him after making offering on the fire-altar, for that\n(altar) is his divine body, and\n\np. 228\n\nthis (Sacrificer himself) is his human one; and the gods indeed were first,\nand thereafter the men: therefore, after making offering, he anoints him with\nwhat remains over of that same (offering-material) 1. He then throws the\ndipping-spoon after (the oblations into the fire).\n\n9:3:4:1717\\. Placing himself near the (Sacrificer's) right arm, he then\nanoints him 2, with (Va _g_. S. XVIII, 3-7), 'At the impulse of the divine\nSavit _ri_ , I anoint thee, by the arms of the A _s_ vins, by the hands of\nPushan, by the support of Sarasvati Va _k_ , the supporter, by the universal\nsovereignty of Agni!'--for Sarasvati is Va _k_ (speech), and hers is all this\nsupport. Impelled by Savit _ri_ , he thus anoints him by all this support of\nSarasvati Va _k_ , the supporter, and by the universal sovereignty of Agni.\nHere he throws the cup (into the fire), lest what is anointed (with offering\nmaterial) should remain outside the fire.\n\n9:3:4:1818\\. He anoints him h the middle of the Partha oblations, for the\nPartha oblations are the year: he thus places him in the middle of the year.\nSix he offers before, and six after (the consecration ceremony), for there are\nsix seasons: by the seasons he thus encloses (guards) him who is consecrated\non both sides. B _ri_ haspati is the last of the first (six 3), and Indra the\nfirst of the\n\np. 229\n\nlast (six),--B _ri_ haspati is the priesthood (or priestly office), and Indra\nis the nobility (or political power): by the priesthood and the nobility he\nthus encloses him who is consecrated on both sides.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[223:2](sbe4338.htm#fr_385) That is, oblations capable of promoting or\nquickening strength (or food,--va _g_ a); see part iii, p. 37 (where read Va\n_g_ aprasaviya). While the formulas of the first seven of these oblations are\nthe same as those used for those of the Va _g_ apeya (see V, 2, 2, 5-11), the\nformulas of the last seven of these oblations are Va _g_. S. XVIII, 30-36 (for\nthe first of which, being the same as IX, 5, see VI, 1, 4, 4).\n\n[223:3](sbe4338.htm#fr_386) This seems to be in apposition to both 'that\nfood,' and 'those objects of desire.'\n\n[224:1](sbe4338.htm#fr_387) Or, pan. It has a handle, and serves on this\noccasion in place of the offering-ladle as well as for anointing the\nSacrificer.\n\n[225:1](sbe4338.htm#fr_388) In the same way as, at the Ra _g_ asuya, six\nPartha oblations were offered before, and as many immediately after, the\nConsecration ceremony, or 'anointment' (see part iii, p. 8 1 seq.), so also on\nthe present occasion, except that, between the first six Parthas and the\nconsecration ceremony, the Va _g_ aprasaviya set, referred to in the preceding\nparagraphs, is inserted.\n\n[225:2](sbe4338.htm#fr_389) For these seven oblations, see V, 2, 2, 6-11. Only\nthe second set of seven thus is peculiar to the Agni _k_ ayana.\n\n[226:1](sbe4338.htm#fr_390) See V, 1, 1, 12.\n\n[227:1](sbe4338.htm#fr_391) Saya _n_ a takes 'asp _ri_ sh _t_ am pari _s_ rita\n_h_ ' to mean 'lightly touched (just touched) by an enclosing-stone.' The\nparticiple would rather seem here to have an active meaning, like 'anvarabdha'\nin the same paragraph.\n\n[228:1](sbe4338.htm#fr_392) That is, with the remainder of the mess of\ndifferent kinds of seed mixed with milk and water.\n\n[228:2](sbe4338.htm#fr_393) That is, by sprinkling him with the liquid, or\npouring it on him.\n\n[228:3](sbe4338.htm#fr_394) The formulas of the twelve Partha oblations are\nthe same as those used on the occasion of the Ra _g_ asuya (V, 3, 5, 8. 9),\nthe sixth of which is 'To B _ri_ haspati hail!' and the seventh 'To Indra\nhail!'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 4, 1.
