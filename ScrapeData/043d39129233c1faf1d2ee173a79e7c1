Should it be said that this is not so on account of the inferential marks\nof the individual soul and the chief vital air; we reply that this has been\nexplained before.\n\nWith reference to the plea urged by the Purvapakshin\n\np. 382\n\nthat, owing to inferential marks pointing to the individual soul, and the\ncircumstance of mention being made of the chief vital air, we must decide that\nthe section treats of the enjoying individual soul and not of the highest\nSelf, the Sutra remarks that this argumentation has already been disposed of,\nviz. in connexion with the Pratardana vidya. For there it was shown that when\na text is ascertained, on the ground of a comprehensive survey of initial and\nconcluding clauses, to refer to Brahman, all inferential marks which point to\nother topics must be interpreted so as to fall in with the principal topic.\nNow in our text Brahman is introduced at the outset 'Shall I tell you\nBrahman?' it is further mentioned in the middle of the section, for the clause\n'of whom this is the work' does not refer to the soul in general but to the\nhighest Person who is the cause of the whole world; and at the end again we\nhear of a reward which connects itself only with meditations on Brahman, viz.\nsupreme sovereignty preceded by the conquest of all evil. 'Having overcome all\nevil he obtains pre-eminence among all beings, sovereignty and supremacy--yea,\nhe who knows this.' The section thus being concerned with Brahman, the\nreferences to the individual soul and to the chief vital air must also be\ninterpreted so as to fall in with Brahman. In the same way it was shown above\nthat the references to the individual soul and the chief vital air which are\nmet with in the Pratardana vidya really explain themselves in connexion with a\nthreefold meditation on Brahman. As in the passage 'Then with this pra _n_ a\nalone he becomes one' the two words 'this' and 'pra _n_ a' may be taken as co-\nordinated and it hence would be inappropriate to separate them (and to explain\n'in the pra _n_ a which abides in this soul'), and as the word 'pra _n_ a' is\nascertained to mean Brahman also, we must understand the mention of pra _n_ a\nto be made with a view to meditation on Brahman in so far as having the pra\n_n_ a for its body. But how can the references to the individual soul be put\nin connexion with Brahman?--This point is taken up by the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18.
