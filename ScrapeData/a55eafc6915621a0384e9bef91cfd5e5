But that which abides in the things movable and immovable, i.e. the terms\ndenoting those things, are non-secondary (i.e. of primary denotative power,\nviz. with regard to Brahman); since (their denotative power) is effected by\nthe being of that (i.e. Brahman).\n\nThe 'but' sets aside the objection raised. (The prima facie view here is as\nfollows.) As Brahman, which has all things for its modes, is not the object of\nPerception and the other means of knowledge which give rise to the\napprehension of the things only which are Brahman's modes, and as hence,\npreviously to the study of the Vedanta-texts, the idea of that to which the\nmodes belong (i.e. of Brahman) does not arise, and as the knowledge of all\nwords finally denoting Brahman depends on the existence of the idea of that to\nwhich the modes belong (i. e. Brahman); all the\n\np. 540\n\nindividual words are used in worldly language only separately to denote\nspecial things. In other words, as the terms 'fire' and so on have denotative\npower with regard to particular things only, their denotative power with\nregard to Brahman is secondary, indirect only.--Of this view the Sutra\ndisposes by saying 'that which abides in the moving and the non-moving,' &c.\nThe meaning is--the terms which abide in, i.e. are connected with, the\ndifferent moving and non-moving things, and hence denote those things, possess\nwith regard to Brahman a denotative power which is not 'bhakta,' i.e.\nsecondary or figurative, but primary and direct. 'Why so?' Because the\ndenotative power of all words is dependent on the being of Brahman. For this\nwe know from the scriptural passage which tells how names and forms were\nevolved by Brahman.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'fire.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18.
