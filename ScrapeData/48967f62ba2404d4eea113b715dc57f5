III.\n\nDescription of Bharata-varsha: extent: chief mountains: nine divisions:\nprincipal rivers and mountains of Bharata proper: principal nations:\nsuperiority over other Varshas, especially as the seat of religious acts.\n(Topographical lists.)\n\nTHE country that lies north of the ocean, and south of the snowy mountains, is\ncalled Bharata, for there dwelt the descendants of Bharata. It is nine\nthousand leagues in extent 1, and is the land of works, in consequence of\nwhich men go to heaven, or obtain emancipation.\n\nThe seven main chains of mountains in Bharata are Mahendra, Malaya, Sahya,\n\xc5\x9auktimat, Riksha, Vindhya, and Paripatra 2.\n\nFrom this region heaven is obtained, or even, in some cases, liberation\n\np. 175\n\nfrom existence; or men pass from hence into the condition of brutes, or fall\ninto hell. Heaven, emancipation, a state in mid-air, or in the subterraneous\nrealms, succeeds to existence here, and the world of acts is not the title of\nany other portion of the universe.\n\nThe Varsha of Bharata is divided into nine portions, which I will name to you;\nthey are Indra-dwipa, Kaserumat, Tamravarn\xcc\x81a, Gabhastimat, Naga-dwipa, Saumya,\nGandharba, and Varun\xcc\x81a; the last or ninth Dwipa is surrounded by the ocean,\nand is a thousand Yojanas from north to south 3.\n\nOn the east of Bharata dwell the Kiratas (the barbarians); on the west, the\nYavanas; in the centre reside Brahmans, Kshetriyas, Vai\xc5\x9byas, and \xc5\x9audras,\noccupied in their respective duties of sacrifice, arms, trade, and service 4.\n\nThe \xc5\x9aatadru, Chandrabhaga, and other rivers, flow from the foot of\n\np. 176\n\n[paragraph continues] Himalaya: the Vedasmriti and others from the Paripatra\nmountains: the Narmada and Surasa from the Vindhya hills: the Tapi, Payoshn\xcc\x81i,\nand Nirvindhya from the Riksha mountains; the Godaveri, Bhimarathi,\nKrishn\xcc\x81aveni, and others, from the Sahya mountains: the Kritamala,\nTamraparn\xcc\x81i, and others, from the Malaya hills: the Trisama, Rishikulya, &c.\nfrom the Mahendra: and the Rishikulya, Kumari, and others, from the \xc5\x9auktimat\nmountains. Of such as these, and of minor rivers, there is an infinite number;\nand many nations inhabit the countries on their borders 5.\n\nThe principal nations of Bharata are the Kurus and Panchalas, in the middle\ndistricts: the people of Kamarupa, in the east: the Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ras,\n\np. 177\n\n[paragraph continues] Kalingas, Magadhas, and southern nations, are in the\nsouth: in the extreme west are the Saurasht\xcc\x81ras, \xc5\x9auras, Bhiras, Arbudas: the\nKarushas and Malavas, dwelling along the Paripatra mountains: the Sauviras,\nthe Saindhavas, the Hunas, the Salwas, the people of \xc5\x9aakala, the Madras, the\nRamas, the Ambasht\xcc\x81has, and the Parasikas, and others. These nations drink of\nthe water of the rivers above enumerated, and inhabit their borders, happy and\nprosperous 6.\n\np. 178\n\nIn the Bharata-varsha it is that the succession of four Yugas, or ages, the\nKrita, the Treta, the Dwapara, and Kali, takes place; that pious ascetics\nengage in rigorous penance; that devout men offer sacrifices; and that gifts\nare distributed; all for the sake of another world. In Jambu-dwipa, Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nconsisting of sacrifice, is worshipped, as the male of sacrificial rites, with\nsacrificial ceremonies: he is adored under other forms elsewhere. Bharata is\ntherefore the best of the divisions of Jambu-dwipa, because it is the land of\nworks: the others are places of enjoyment alone. It is only after many\nthousand births, and the aggregation of much merit, that living beings are\nsometimes born in Bharata as men. The gods themselves exclaim, "Happy are\nthose who are born, even from the condition of gods, as men in Bharata-varsha,\nas that is the way to the pleasures of Paradise, or the greater blessing of\nfinal liberation. Happy are they who, consigning all the unheeded rewards of\ntheir acts to the supreme and eternal Vishn\xcc\x81u, obtain existence in that land\nof works, as their path to him. We know not, when the acts that have obtained\nus heaven shall have been fully recompensed 7, where we shall renew corporeal\nconfinement; but we know that those men are fortunate who are born with\nperfect faculties 8 in Bharata-varsha."\n\nI have thus briefly described to you, Maitreya, the nine divisions of Jambu-\ndwipa, which is a hundred thousand Yojanas in extent, and which is encircled,\nas if by a bracelet, by the ocean of salt water, of similar dimensions.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[174:1](vp060.htm#fr_389) As Bharata-varsha means India, a nearer approach to\nthe truth, with regard to its extent, might have been expected; and the Vayu\nhas another measurement, which is not much above twice the actual extent, or\n1000 Yojanas from Kumari (Comorin) to the source of the Ganges.\n\n[174:2](vp060.htm#fr_390) These are called the Kula parvatas, family\nmountains, or mountain ranges or systems. They are similarly enumerated in all\nthe authorities, and their situation may be determined with some confidence by\nthe rivers which flow from them. Mahendra is the chain of hills that extends\nfrom Orissa and the northern Circars to Gondwana, part of which, near Ganjam,\nis still called Mahindra Malei, or hills of Mahindra: Malaya is the southern\nportion of the western Ghats: \xc5\x9auktimat is doubtful, for none of its streams\ncan be identified with any certainty: Sahya is the northern portion of the\nwestern Ghauts, the mountains of the Konkan: Riksha is the mountains of\nGondwana: Vindhya is the general name of the chain that stretches across\ncentral India, but it is here restricted to the eastern division; according to\nthe Vayu it is the part south of the Narmada, or the Sathpura range:\nParipatra, as frequently written Pariyatra, is the northern and western\nportion of the Vindhya: the name, indeed, is still given to a range of\nmountains in Guzerat (see Col. Tod\'s map of Rajasthan), but the Chambal and\nother rivers of Malwa, which are said to flow from the Pariyatra mountains, do\nnot rise in that province. All these mountains therefore belong to one system,\nand are connected together. The classification seems to have been known to\nPtolemy, as he specifies seven ranges of mountains, although his names do not\ncorrespond, with exception of the Vindus mons: of the others, the Adisathrus\nand Uxentus agree nearly in position with the Pariyatra and Riksha: the\nApocopi, Sardonix, Bettigo, and Orudii must be left for consideration. The\nBhagavata, Vayu, Padma, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya add a list of inferior mountains to\nthese seven.\n\n[175:3](vp060.htm#fr_391) This last is similarly left without a name in all\nthe works: it is the most southerly, that on the borders of the sea, and no\ndoubt intends India proper. Wilford places Isere a division called Kumarika.\nNo description is anywhere attempted of the other divisions. To these the Vayu\nadds six minor Dwipas, which are situated beyond sea, and are islands, Anga-\ndwipa, Yama-d., Matsya-d., Kumuda or Ku\xc5\x9ba-d., Varaha-d., and Sankha-d.;\npeopled for the most part by Mlechchhas, but who worship Hindu divinities. The\nBhagavata and Padma name eight such islands, Swarn\xcc\x81aprastha, Chandra\xc5\x9bukla,\nAvarttana, Raman\xcc\x81aka, Mandahara, Panchajanya, Sinhala, and Lanka. Col. Wilford\nhas endeavoured to verify the first series of Upadwipas, making Varaha Europe;\nKu\xc5\x9ba, Asia Minor, &c.; \xc5\x9aankha, Africa; Malaya, Malacca: Yama is undetermined;\nand by Anga, he says, they understand China. How all this may be is more than\ndoubtful, for in the three Puran\xcc\x81as in which mention is made of them, very\nlittle more is said upon the subject.\n\n[175:4](vp060.htm#fr_392) By Kiratas, foresters and mountaineers are intended,\nthe inhabitants to the present day of the mountains east of Hindustan. The\nYavanas, on the west, may be either the Greeks of Bactria and the Punjab--to\nwhom there can be little doubt the term was applied by the Hindus--or the\nMohammedans, who succeeded them in a later period, and to whom it is now\napplied. The Vayu calls them both Mlechchhas, and also notices the admixture\nof barbarians with Hindus in India proper. The same passage, slightly varied,\noccurs in the Mahabharata: it is said especially of the mountainous districts,\nand may allude therefore to the Gonds and Bhils of central India, as well as\nto the Mohammedans of the north-west. The specification implies that infidels\nand outcastes had not yet descended on the plains of Hindustan.\n\n[176:5](vp060.htm#fr_393) This is a very meagre list, compared with those\ngiven in other Puran\xcc\x81as. That of the Vayu is translated by Col. Wilford, As.\nRes. vol. VIII; and much curious illustration of many of the places by the\nsame writer occurs, As. Res. vol. XIV. The lists of the Mahabharata,\nBhagavata, and Padma are given without any arrangement: those of the Vayu,\nMatsya, Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, and Kurma are classed as in the text. Their lists are\ntoo long for insertion in this place. Of the rivers named in the text, most\nare capable of verification. The \xc5\x9aatadru, \'the hundred channelled\'--the\nZaradrus of Ptolemy, Hesidrus of Pliny--is the Setlej. The Chandrabhaga,\nSandabalis, or Acesines, is the Chinab. The Vedasmriti in the Vayu and Kurma\nis classed with the Vetravati or Betwa, the Charmanwati or Chambal, and Sipra\nand Para, rivers of Malwa, and may be the same with the Beos of the maps. The\nNarmada or Narbadda, the Namadus of Ptolemy, is well known; according to the\nVayu it rises, not in the Vindhya, but in the Riksha mountains, taking its\norigin in fact in Gondwana. The Surasa is uncertain. The Tapi is the Tapti,\nrising also in Gondwana: the other two are not identified. The Godaveri\npreserves its name: in the other two we have the Beemah and the Krishn\xcc\x81a. For\nKritamala the Kurma reads Ritumala, but neither is verified. The Tamraparni is\nin Tinivelly, and rises at the southern extremity of the western Ghats. The\nRishikulya, that rises in the Mahendra mountain, is the Rasikulia or\nRasikoila, which flows into the sea near Ganjam. The Trisama is undetermined.\nThe text assigns another Rishikulya to the \xc5\x9auktimat mountains, but in all the\nother authorities the word is Rishika. The Kumari might suggest some connexion\nwith Cape Comorin, but that the Malaya mountains seem to extend to the extreme\nsouth. A Rishikulya river is mentioned (Vana P. v. 3026) as a Tirtha in the\nMahabharata, in connexion apparently with the hermitage of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, which\nin another passage (v. 4096) is said to be on mount Arbuda or Abu. In that\ncase, and if the reading of the text be admitted for the name of the river,\nthe \xc5\x9auktimat range would be the mountains of Guzerat; but this is doubtful.\n\n[177:6](vp060.htm#fr_394) The list of nations is as scanty as that of the\nrivers: it is, however, omitted altogether in the Bhagavata. The Padma has a\nlong catalogue, but without arrangement; so has the Mahabharata. The lists of\nthe Vayu, Matsya, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya class the nations as central, northern,\neastern, southern, and western. The names are much the same in all, and are\ngiven in the 8th vol. of the As. Res. from the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, or, for it is the\nsame account, the Vayu. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya has a second classification, and,\ncomparing Bharata-varsha to a tortoise, with its head to the east, enumerates\nthe countries in the head, tail, flanks, and feet of the animal. It will be\nsufficient here to attempt an identification of the names in the text, but\nsome further illustration is offered at the end of the chapter. The Kurus are\nthe people of Kurukshetra, or the upper part of the Doab, about Delhi. The\nPanchalas, it appears from the Mahabharata, occupied the lower part of the\nDoab, extending across the Jumna to the Chambal. Kulluka Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a, in his\ncommentary on Manu, II. 59, places them at Kanoj. Kamarupa is the north-\neastern part of Bengal, and western portion of Asam. Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ra is Bengal\nproper, with part of south Behar and the Jungle Mahals. Kalinga is the sea-\ncoast west of the mouths of the Ganges, with the upper part of the Coromandel\ncoast. Magadha is Behar. The Saurasht\xcc\x81ras are the people of Surat, the\nSurastrene of Ptolemy. The \xc5\x9auras and Bhiras, in the same direction, may be the\nSuri and Phauni or Phryni of Strabo. The Arbudas must be the people about\nmount Abu, or the natives of Mewar. The Karushas and Malavas are of course the\npeople of Malwa. The Sauviras and Saindhavas are usually conjoined as the\nSindhu-Sauviras, and must be the nations of Sindh and western Rajputana. By\nthe Minas we are to understand the white Huns or Indo-Scythians, who were\nestablished in the Punjab and along the Indus at the commencement of our era,\nas we know from Arrian, Strabo, and Ptolemy, confirmed by recent discoveries\nof their coins, The \xc5\x9aalwas or, as also read, \xc5\x9aalyas are placed by the Vayu and\nMatsya amongst the central nations, and seem to have occupied part of\nRajasthan, a \xc5\x9aalwa Raja being elsewhere described as engaging in hostilities\nwith the people of Dwaraka in Guzerat. \xc5\x9aakala, as I have elsewhere noticed, is\na city in the Punjab (As. Res. XV. 108), the Sagala of Ptolemy (ibid. 107);\nthe Mahabharata makes it the capital of the Madras, the Mardi of the ancients;\nbut they are separately named in the text, and were situated something more to\nthe south-east. p. 178 The Ramas and Ambasht\xcc\x81has are not named in the other\nPuran\xcc\x81as, but the latter are amongst the western, or more properly north-\nwestern nations subjugated by Nakula, in his Dig-vijaya. Mahabh. Sabha P.\nAmbas and Ambasht\xcc\x81has are included in the list extracted by Col. Wilford from\nthe Varaha Sanhita, and the latter are supposed by him to be the Ambastae of\nArrian. The Parasikas carry us into Persia, or that part of it adjoining to\nthe Indus. As far as the enumeration of the text extends, it seems applicable\nto the political and geographical divisions of India about the era of\nChristianity.\n\n[178:7](vp060.htm#fr_395) Enjoyment in Swarga, like punishment in Naraka, is\nonly for a certain period, according to the merit or demerit of the\nindividual. When the account is balanced, the man is born again amongst\nmankind.\n\n[178:8](vp060.htm#fr_396) A crippled or mutilated person, or one whose organs\nare defective, cannot at once obtain liberation; his merits must first secure\nhis being born again perfect and entire.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Topographical Lists from the Mahabharata](vp061.htm)\n\n'
