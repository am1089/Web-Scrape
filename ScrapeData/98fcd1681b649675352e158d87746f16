For at\nthat time Indra set his mind upon that food of Pra _g_ apati, and tried to go\nfrom him. He spake, 'Why dost thou go from me? why dost thou leave me?'--'Give\nme the essence of that food: enter me therewith!'--'So be it!' so he gave him\nthe essence of that food, and entered him therewith.\n\n8:5:3:22\\. Now he who was that Pra _g_ apati is this very Agni (the fire-\naltar) that is now being built up; and that food is these _Kh_ andasya\n(bricks); and that essence of food is these Stomabhagas; and he who was Indra\nis yonder \xc3\x82ditya (the sun): he indeed is the Stoma (hymn of praise), for\nwhatsoever praises they sing, it is him they praise thereby,--it is to that\nsame Stoma he gave a share; and inasmuch as\n\np. 93\n\nhe gave a share (bhaga) to that Stoma, these are (called) Stomabhagas.\n\n8:5:3:33\\. [He lays them down, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 6. 7], 'By the ray quicken\nthou the truth for truth!'--the ray, doubtless, is that (sun), and ray is\nfood; having put together that (sun) and the essence thereof, he makes it\nenter his own self;--'by the starting, by the law, quicken the law!'--the\nstarting, doubtless, is that (sun), and the starting also means food: having\nput together that (sun) and the essence thereof, he makes it enter his own\nself;--'by the going after, by the sky, quicken the sky!'--the going after,\ndoubtless, is that (sun), and the going after also means food; having put\ntogether that (sun) and the essence thereof, he makes it enter his own self.\nThus whatever he mentions here, that and the essence thereof he puts together\nand makes it enter his own self: 'By such and such quicken thou such and\nsuch!'--'Such and such thou art: for such and such (I deposit) thee!'--'By the\nlord, by strength, quicken strength!' thus they (the bricks) are divided into\nthree kinds, for food is of three kinds.\n\n8:5:3:44\\. And as to why he lays down the Stomabhagas. Now the gods, having\nlaid down the far-shining layer, mounted it. They spake, 'Meditate ye!'\nwhereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating,\nthey saw even the firmament, the heavenly world, and laid it down. Now that\nsame firmament, the heavenly world, indeed is the same as these Stomabhagas,\nand thus in laying down these, he lays down the firmament, the heavenly world.\n\n8:5:3:55\\. The first three (bricks) are this (terrestrial)\n\np. 94\n\nworld, the second (three) the air, and the third (three) the sky, the fourth\nthe eastern, the fifth the southern, the sixth the western, and the seventh\nthe northern regions.\n\n8:5:3:66\\. These twenty-one bricks, then, are these worlds and the regions,\nand these worlds and the regions are a foundation, and these worlds and the\nregions are twenty-one: whence they say, 'the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a (twenty-one-\nfold) is a foundation.'\n\n8:5:3:77\\. And the eight bricks which remain over are the Gayatri consisting\nof eight syllables; but the Gayatri is the Brahman, and as to that Brahman, it\nis yonder burning disk: it burns, while firmly-established on that twenty-one-\nfold one, as on a foundation, whence it does not fall down.\n\n8:5:3:88\\. Now some lay down a thirtieth (Stomabhaga), with, 'Beautifully\narrayed, quicken thou the kshatra for the kshatra!' saying, 'Of thirty\nsyllables is the Vira _g_ (metre) and this layer is vira _g_ (far-shining).'\nBut let him not do so: they (who do so) exceed (this layer so as not to be)\namounting to the twenty-one-fold, and to the Gayatri; and that undiminished\nVira _g_ , doubtless, is the world of Indra: in the world of Indra they raise\na spiteful enemy of equal power (to Indra), and thrust Indra out of the world\nof Indra. And at his own sacrifice the Sacrificer assuredly is Indra: in the\nSacrificer's realm they raise for the Sacrificer a spiteful enemy of equal\npower, and thrust the Sacrificer out of the Sacrificer's own realm. But,\nsurely, that fire which they bring hither is no other than this Sacrificer: by\nmeans of his foundation it is he who is the thirtieth (brick) in this (layer).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 5, 4.
