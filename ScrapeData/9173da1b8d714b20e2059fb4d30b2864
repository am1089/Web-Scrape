And (the divinity is) endowed with all powers, because that is seen.\n\nThe highest divinity which is different in nature from all other things is\nendowed with all powers; for scriptural texts show it to be such, 'His high\npower is revealed as manifold, as essential, and so his knowledge, force, and\naction' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 8). In the same way another text first declares the\nhighest divinity to differ in nature from everything else, 'Free from sin,\nfrom old age, from death and grief, from hunger and thirst',and then goes on\nto represent it as endowed with all powers, 'realising all its wishes,\nrealising all its intentions',&c.( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 5). Compare also 'He,\nconsisting of mind, having pra _n_ a for his body, whose form is light, who\nrealises his wishes,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 2).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 31.
