XIII,\n56), 'This one behind, the all-embracer;'--the all-embracer, doubtless, is\nyonder sun, for as soon as 1 he rises, all this embracing space comes into\nexistence. And because he speaks of him as (being) 'behind,' therefore one\nsees him only when he goes towards the back (west). The Sun, indeed, having\nbecome the eye, remained behind: it is that form he now bestows (on Agni).\n\n8:1:2:22\\. 'His, the all-embracer's child, the Eye,'--from out of that (all-\nembracing) form, the Sun, he fashioned the eye;--'the rains, the offspring of\nthe eye,'--from out of the eye he fashioned the rainy season;--'the _G_ agati,\nthe daughter of the rains,'--from out of the rainy season he fashioned the _G_\nagati metre;--'from the _G_ agati the _Ri_ ksama,'--from out of the _G_ agati\nmetre he fashioned the _Ri_ ksama hymn-tune 2;--'from the _Ri_ ksama\n\np. 9\n\nthe _S_ ukra,'--from out of the _Ri_ ksama-saman he fashioned the _S_ ukra-\ngraha;--'from the _S_ ukra the Saptada _s_ a,'--from out of the _S_ ukra cup\nhe fashioned the seventeen-versed hymn-form;--'from the Saptada _s_ a the\nVairupa,'--from out of the Saptada _s_ a-stoma he fashioned the Vairupa-p _ri_\nsh _th_ a.\n\n8:1:2:33\\. 'The _Ri_ shi _G_ amadagni,'--the _Ri_ shi _G_ amadagni, doubtless,\nis the eye: inasmuch as thereby the world of the living ( _g_ agat) sees and\nthinks, therefore the _Ri_ shi _G_ amadagni is the eye.--'By thee, taken by\nPra _g_ apati,'--that is, 'by thee, created by Pra _g_ apati,'--'I take the\neye for my descendants,' therewith he introduced the eye from behind.\nSeparately he lays down (these ten bricks): what separate desires there are in\nthe eye those he thereby lays into it. Only once he settles them: he thereby\nmakes this eye one; but were he to settle them each separately, he assuredly\nwould cut the eye asunder. This is a threefold brick: the meaning of this has\nbeen explained.\n\n8:1:2:44\\. And on the left (upper, north) side, with (Va _g_. S. XIII, 57),\n'This, on the upper side, heaven,'--in the upper sphere, doubtless, are the\nregions (quarters); and as to why he speaks of them as being 'on the upper\n(left) side,' the regions, indeed,\n\np. 10\n\nare above everything here. And as to why he says, 'heaven (or, the light),'\nthe regions, indeed, are the heavenly world (or world of light). The regions,\nhaving become the ear, remained above: it is that form he now bestows (on\nAgni).\n\n8:1:2:55\\. 'Its, heaven's, child, the Ear,'--from out of that form, the\nregions, he fashioned the ear;--'the autumn, the daughter of the ear,'--from\nout of the ear he fashioned the autumn season;--'Anush _t_ ubh, the daughter\nof the autumn,'--from out of the autumn season he fashioned the Anush _t_ ubh\nmetre;--'from the Anush _t_ ubh the Ai _d_ a,'--from out of the Anush _t_ ubh\nmetre he fashioned the Ai _d_ a-saman 1;--'from the Ai _d_ a the Manthin,'--\nfrom out of the Ai _d_ a-saman he fashioned the Manthin cup;--'from the\nManthin the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a,'--from out of the Manthi-graha he fashioned the\ntwenty-one-versed hymn-form;--'from the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a the Vaira _g_ a,'--\nfrom out of the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a-stoma he fashioned the Vaira _g_ a-p _ri_ sh\n_th_ a.\n\n8:1:2:66\\. 'The _Ri_ shi Vi _s_ vamitra,'--the _Ri_ shi Vi _s_ vamitra ('all-\nfriend'), doubtless, is the ear: because therewith one hears in every\ndirection, and because there is a friend (mitra) to it on every side,\ntherefore the ear is the _Ri_ shi Vi _s_ vamitra.--'By thee, taken by Pra _g_\napati,'--that is, 'by thee, erected by Pra _g_ apati;'--'I take the ear for my\ndescendants,'\n\np. 11\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--therewith he introduced the ear from the left (or\nupper) side. Separately he lays down (these bricks): what separate desires\nthere are in the ear, those he thereby lays into it. Only once he settles\nthem: he thereby makes the ear one; but were he to settle them each\nseparately, he assuredly would cut the ear asunder. This is a threefold brick:\nthe meaning of this has been explained.\n\n8:1:2:77\\. Then in the centre, with (Va _g_. S. XIII, 58), 'This one, above,\nthe mind,'--above, doubtless, is the moon; and as to why he speaks of him as\n(being) 'above,' the moon is indeed above; and as to why he says, 'the mind,'\nthe mind (mati), doubtless, is speech, for by means of speech everything\nthinks (man) here 1. The moon, having become speech, remained above: it is\nthat form he now bestows (on. Agni).\n\n8:1:2:88\\. 'Its, the mind's, daughter, Speech,'--from out of that form, the\nmoon, he fashioned speech;--'Winter, the son of Speech,'--from out of speech\nhe fashioned the winter season;--'Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti, the daughter of Winter,'--from out\nof the winter season he fashioned the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti metre;--'from the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti the\nNidhanavat,'--from out of the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti metre he fashioned the Nidhanavat-saman\n2;--'from the Nidhanavat the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a,'--from out of the Nidhanavat-saman\nhe fashioned the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a cup;--'from the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a the Tri _n_ ava and\nTrayastri _m_ _s_ a,'--from out of the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a-graha he fashioned the\nthrice-nine-versed and the three-and-thirty-versed hymn-forms;--\n\np. 12\n\n[paragraph continues] 'from the Tri _n_ ava and Trayastri _m_ _s_ a the _S_\nakvara and Raivata,'--from out of the Tri _n_ ava and Trayastri _m_ _s_\na-stomas he fashioned the _S_ akvara and Raivata-p _ri_ sh _th_ as 1.\n\n8:1:2:99\\. 'The _Ri_ shi Vi _s_ vakarman,'--the _Ri_ shi Vi _s_ vakarman ('the\nall-worker'), doubtless, is Speech, for by speech everything here is done:\nhence the _Ri_ shi Vi _s_ vakarman is speech:--'By thee, taken by Pra _g_\napati,'--that is, 'by thee, created by Pra _g_ apati;'--'I take speech for my\ndescendants,'--therewith he introduced speech from above. Separately he lays\ndown (these bricks): what separate desires there are in speech, those he now\nlays into it. Only once he settles them: he thereby makes speech one; but were\nhe to settle them each separately, he assuredly would cut speech asunder. This\nis a threefold brick: the meaning of this has been explained.\n\n8:1:2:1010\\. This, then, is that same food which both the vital airs and Pra\n_g_ apati created: just so great indeed is the whole sacrifice, and the\nsacrifice is the food of the gods.\n\n8:1:2:1111\\. He lays them down by ten and ten,--of ten syllables consists the\nVira _g_ (metre), and the Vira _g_ is all food: he thus bestows on him (Agni)\nthe whole food. He puts them down on every side: on every side he thus bestows\nthe whole food on him. And verily these same Vira _g_ (verses) sustain those\nvital airs, and inasmuch as they sustain (bh _ri_ ) the vital airs (pra _n_ a)\nthey are called Pranabh _ri_ ta _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[8:1](sbe4304.htm#fr_49) Or, perhaps, 'only when' (yada-eva).\n\n[8:2](sbe4304.htm#fr_50) No explanation of this saman has been found anywhere.\nSaya _n_ a, on the corresponding formula, Taitt. S. IV, 3, 4, 2 (where the\nterm is spelt _ri_ kshama), merely remarks that it is a kind of saman.' The\nmeaning of the term 'similar to a _ri_ _k_ ' would seem to indicate a hymn-\ntune involving little, or no, modification of the text chanted to it. At V, 4,\n1, 5 it is the Vairupa-saman which (together with the _G_ agati, the Saptada\n_s_ a-stoma, the rainy season, and the Vi _s_ ) is in this way connected with\nthe West. Now the textual parts of the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ anidhana _m_ Vairupam\n(Sama-v., vol. v, pp. 387, 575-6), ordinarily used as a p _ri_ sh _th_\na-saman, show p. 9 hardly any modifications on the original verses (Sama-v.,\nvol. ii, p. 278), even less so indeed than the simple Vairupa-saman\n([Sama](errata.htm#0)-v., vol. i, p. 572), and possibly ' _ri_ ksama' (if it\ndoes not apply to a whole class of samans) may be another name for the Vairupa\n(of which there are two other forms, Sama-v., vol. i, pp. 425, 438) in its\nsimplest form. The Vairupa, in its p _ri_ sh _th_ a form, would in that case,\nindeed, have originated from the _Ri_ ksama-saman. It is true, however, that\nthere is no special connection between the other P _ri_ sh _th_ a-samans and\nthe respective hymn-tune with which they are symbolically connected in the\nforegoing formulas.\n\n[10:1](sbe4304.htm#fr_51) Ai _d_ a-samans are those samans which have the word\n'i _d_ a' for their nidhana, or chorus. Such samans are, e _g_. the Vairupa\n(Sama-v., vol. V, p. 387) and the Raurava (iii, 83), the latter of which forms\nthe central saman of the Madhyandina-pavamana-stotra. What connection there\ncan be between the Ai _d_ a and the Vaira _g_ a-p _ri_ sh _th_ a (Sama-v.,\nvol. v, p. 391; cf. vol. i, pp. 814-5) it is not easy to see. In _S_ at. Br.\nV, 4,i, 6 the North is connected with the Anush _t_ ubh, the Vaira _g_\na-saman, the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a and the autumn.\n\n[11:1](sbe4304.htm#fr_52) Or, perhaps, one thinks everything here.\n\n[11:2](sbe4304.htm#fr_53) That is a saman which has a special nidhana, or\nchorus, added at the end (or inserted in the middle) of it.\n\n[12:1](sbe4304.htm#fr_54) For these P _ri_ sh _th_ a-samans see part iii,\nintrod. pp. xx-xxi. In V, 4, I, 7 the upper region is symbolically connected\nwith the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti metre, the _S_ akvara and Raivata-samans, the Tri _n_ ava and\nTrayastri _m_ _s_ a-stomas, and the winter and dewy seasons.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 1, 3.
