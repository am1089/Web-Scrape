He extends these (verses) by (interpolating) the sound 1. Verily, the\nsound is purusha, man. Therefore every man when he speaks, sounds loud, as it\nwere.\n\n2\\. At the end of each foot of the first verse of the hymn tad id asa, he\ninserts one foot of the second verse of hymn Rv. VIII, 69, nada _m_ va\nodatinam, &c. Thus the verse is to be recited as follows:\n\nTad id asa bhuvaneshu _g_ yesh _th_ am pu  \n    nada _m_ va odatinam,  \nYato _g_ a _g_ \xc3\xb1a ugras tveshan _ri_ m _n_ o ru  \n    nada _m_ yoyuvatinam,  \nSadyo ga _g_ \xc3\xb1ano ni ri _n_ ati _s_ atrun  \n    pati _m_ vo aghnyanam,  \nAnu yam vi _s_ ve madanti uma _h_ sho  \n    dhenunam ishudhyasi.\n\n\n\np. 182\n\nIn nada _m_ va odatinam (Rv. VIII, 69, 2), odati 1 are the waters in heaven,\nfor they water all this; and they are the waters in the mouth, for they water\nall good food.\n\n3\\. In nada _m_ yoyuvatinam (Rv. VIII, 69, 2), yoyuvati are the waters in the\nsky, for they seem to inundate; and they are the waters of perspiration, for\nthey seem to run continually.\n\n4\\. In pati _m_ vo aghnyanam (Rv. VIII, 69, 2), aghnya are the waters which\nspring from the smoke of fire, and they are the waters which spring from the\norgan.\n\n5\\. In dhenunam ishudhyasi (Rv. VIII, 69, 2), the dhenu (cows) are the waters,\nfor they delight all this; and ishudhyasi means, thou art food.\n\n6\\. He extends a Trish _t_ ubh and an Anush _t_ ubh 2. Trish _t_ ubh is the\nman, Anush _t_ ubh the wife, and they make a couple. Therefore does a man,\nafter having found a wife, consider himself a more perfect man.\n\n7\\. These verses, by repeating the first three times, become twenty-five. The\ntrunk is the twenty-fifth, and Pra _g_ apati is the twenty-fifth 3. There are\nten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, two legs, two arms, and the\ntrunk the twenty-fifth. He adorns that trunk as the twenty-fifth. Now this day\nconsists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that day consists of twenty-\nfive: it becomes the same\n\np. 183\n\nthrough the same. Therefore the two, the day and the hymn, are twenty-five\n[1](sbe01194.htm#fn_447).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[181:1](sbe01192.htm#fr_445) The sound, nada, is really a verse beginning with\nnadam, and which is interpolated after the syllables pu ru sha _h_.\n\n[182:1](sbe01192.htm#fr_446) The nasal pluta on iti is explained as\npadapratikagraha _n_ e 'tyantamadarartha _h_. Cf. Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 1, 4, 3.\n\n[182:2](sbe01192.htm#fr_447) Tad id asa is a Trish _t_ ubh, nada _m_ va _h_ an\nAnush _t_ ubh.\n\n[182:3](sbe01192.htm#fr_448) Cf.
