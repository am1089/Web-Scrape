X.\n\nNames of the twelve \xc3\x81dityas. Names of the Rishis, Gandharbhas, Apsarasas,\nYakshas, Uragas, and Rakshasas, who attend the chariot of the sun in each\nmonth of the year. Their respective functions.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Between the extreme northern and southern points the sun has to\ntraverse in a year one hundred and eighty degrees, ascending and descending 1.\nHis car is presided over by divine \xc3\x81dityas, Rishis, heavenly singers and\nnymphs, Yakshas, serpents, and Rakshasas (one of each being placed in it in\nevery month). The \xc3\x81ditya Dhatri, the sage Pulastya, the Gandharba Tumburu, the\nnymph Kratust\xcc\x81hala, the Yaksha Rathakrit, the serpent Vasuki, and the Rakshas\nHeti, always reside in the sun's car, in the month of Madhu or Chaitra, as its\nseven guardians. In Vai\xc5\x9bakh or Madhava the seven are \xc3\x81ryamat, Pulaha, Nareda,\nPunjikasthali, Rathaujas, Kachanira, and Praheti. In \xc5\x9auchi or Jyesht\xcc\x81ha they\nare Mitra, Atri, Haha, Mena, Rathaswana, Takshaka, and Paurusheya. In the\nmonth \xc5\x9aukra or \xc3\x81shadha they are Varun\xcc\x81a, Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, Huhu, Sahajanya,\nRathachitra, Naga, and Budha. In the month Nabhas (or Sravan\xcc\x81a) they are\nIndra, Angiras, Viswavasu, Pramlocha, \xc5\x9arotas, and Elapatra (the name of both\nserpent and Rakshas). In the month Bhadrapada they are Vivaswat, Bhrigu,\nUgrasena, Anumlocha, \xc3\x81puran\xcc\x81a, \xc5\x9aankhapala, and Vyaghra. In the month of \xc3\x81swin\nthey are Pushan, Gautama, Suruchi, Ghritachi, Sushena, Dhananjaya, and Vata.\nIn the month of Kartik they are Parjanya, Bharadwaja, (another) Viswavasu,\nViswachi, Senajit, Airavata, and Chapa. In Agrahayana or Marga\xc5\x9birsha they are\nAnsu, Ka\xc5\x9byapa, Chitrasena, Urvasi, Tarkshya, Mahapadma, and Vidyut. In the\nmonth of Pausha, Bhaga, Kratu, Urn\xcc\x81ayu, Purvachitti,\n\np. 234\n\n[paragraph continues] Arisht\xcc\x81anemi, Karkot\xcc\x81aka, and Sphurja are the seven who\nabide in the orb of the sun, the glorious spirits who scatter light throughout\nthe universe. In the month of Magha the seven who are in the sun are\nTwasht\xcc\x81ri, Jamadagni, Dhritarasht\xcc\x81ra, Tilottama, Ritajit, Kambala, and\nBrahmapeta. Those who abide in the sun in the month Phalguna are Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nVisvamitra, Suryaverchchas, Rambha, Satyajit, Aswatara, and Yajnapeta.\n\nIn this manner, Maitreya, a troop of seven celestial beings, supported by the\nenergy of Vishn\xcc\x81u, occupies during the several months the orb of the sun. The\nsage celebrates his praise, and the Gandharba sings, and the nymph dances\nbefore him: the Rakshas attends upon his steps, the serpent harnesses his\nsteeds, and the Yaksha trims the reins: the numerous pigmy sages, the\nBalakhilyas, ever surround his chariot. The whole troop of seven, attached to\nthe sun's car, are the agents in the distribution of cold, heat, and rain, at\ntheir respective seasons 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[233:1](vp068.htm#fr_713) It might be doubted whether the text meant 180 in\neach hemisphere or in both, but the sense is sufficiently clear in the Vayu,\n&c., and the number of Man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81alas travelled in the year is 360: the\nMan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81alas, 'circles' or 'degrees,' being in fact the sun's diurnal\nrevolutions, and their numbers corresponding with the days of the solar year;\nas in the Bhavishya P. 'The horses of the sun travel twice 180 degrees in a\nyear, internal and external (to the equator), in the order of the days.'\n\n[234:2](vp068.htm#fr_714) A similar enumeration of the attendants upon the\nsun's car occurs in the Vayu, &c. For Yakshas, the generic term there employed\nis Graman\xcc\x81is, but the individuals are the same. The Kurma and Bhavishya refer\nthe twelve \xc3\x81dityas to different months:--\n\n\n\n|\n\nVishn\xcc\x81u.\n\n|\n\nKurma.\n\n|\n\nBhavishya.  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \nDhatri\n\n|\n\nChaitra\n\n|\n\nVai\xc5\x9bakha\n\n|\n\nKartika  \n  \n\xc3\x81ryamat\n\n|\n\nVai\xc5\x9bakha\n\n|\n\nChaitra\n\n|\n\nVai\xc5\x9bakha  \n  \nMitra\n\n|\n\nJyesht\xcc\x81ha\n\n|\n\nMarga\xc5\x9birsha  \n\n|\n\nMarga\xc5\x9birsha  \n  \nVarun\xcc\x81a\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x81shad\xcc\x81ha\n\n|\n\nMagha\n\n|\n\nBhadra  \n  \nIndra\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9aravan\xcc\x81a\n\n|\n\nJyesht\xcc\x81ha\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x81swina  \n  \nVivaswat  \n\n|\n\nBhadra\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9aravan\xcc\x81a\n\n|\n\nJyesht\xcc\x81ha  \n  \nPushan\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x81swina\n\n|\n\nPhalguna\n\n|\n\nPausha  \n  \nParjanya\n\n|\n\nKartika\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x81swina\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9aravan\xcc\x81a  \n  \nAnsu\n\n|\n\nMarga\xc5\x9birsha  \n\n|\n\n\xc3\x81shad\xcc\x81ha\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x81shad\xcc\x81ha  \n  \nBhaga\n\n|\n\nPausha\n\n|\n\nBhadra\n\n|\n\nMagha  \n  \nTwasht\xcc\x81ri\n\n|\n\nMagha\n\n|\n\nKartika\n\n|\n\nPhalguna  \n  \nVishn\xcc\x81u\n\n|\n\nPhalguna\n\n|\n\nPausha\n\n|\n\nChaitra.  \n  \n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI](vp069.htm)\n\n"
