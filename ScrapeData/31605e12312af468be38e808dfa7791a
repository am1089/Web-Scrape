And as he walked along, the goblin on his\nshoulder said: "O King, I will tell you a story about a great love. Listen."\n\n\n\nThere is a city called Ujjain, which seems like a divine city made by the\nCreator for the pious who have fallen from heaven. In this city there was a\nfamous king named Lotus-belly. He delighted the good, and defeated the king of\nthe demons.\n\nWhile he was king, a merchant named Fortune, richer than the god of wealth,\nlived in the city. He had one daughter named Love-cluster, who seemed the\nmodel from whom the Creator had made the nymphs of heaven. This merchant gave\nhis daughter to a merchant named Jewel-guard from Copper City.\n\nAs he was a tender father and had no other children, the merchant stayed with\nhis daughter Love-cluster and her husband. Now Love-cluster came to hate\nJewel-guard as a sick man hates a pungent, biting medicine. But the beautiful\nwoman was dearer than life to her husband, dear as long-fathered wealth to a\nmiser.\n\nOne day Jewel-guard started for Copper City to pay a loving visit to his\nparents. Then the hot summer came, and the roads were blocked for travellers\nby the sharp arrows of the sun. The winds blew soft with the fragrance of\njasmine and trumpet-flower, like sighs from the mouths of mountains separated\nfrom the springtime. And wind-swept dust-clouds flew to the sky like\nmessengers from the burning earth begging for clouds. And the feverish days\nmoved slowly like wayfarers who cling to the shade of trees. And the nights\nclad in pale yellow moonlight became very feeble without the invigorating\nembrace of winter.\n\nAt this time Love-cluster, anointed with cooling sandal, and clad in thin\ngarments stood at her lattice-window. And she saw a handsome youth with a\nfriend whom he trusted. He seemed the god of love born anew and seeking his\nbride. He was the son of the king\'s priest, and his name was Lotus-lake.\n\nAnd when Lotus-lake saw the lovely girl, he expanded with delight as lotuses\nin a lake expand at the sight of the moon. When the two young people saw each\nother, their hearts embraced each other at the bidding of Love, their teacher.\n\nSo Lotus-lake was smitten with love, and was led home with difficulty by his\nfriend. And Love-cluster was equally maddened by love. First she learned from\nher friend his name and home, then slowly withdrew to her room. There she\nthought of him and became feverish with love, simply tossing on her couch,\nseeing nothing and hearing nothing.\n\nAfter two or three days spent in this way, she felt bashful and fearful, pale\nand thin from the separation, and hopeless of union with her lover. So, as if\ndrawn on by the moonbeam which shone through her window, she went out at night\nwhen her people were asleep, determined to die. And she came to a pool under a\ntree in her garden.\n\nThere stood a family image of the goddess Gauri, set up by her father. She\ndrew near to this image, bowed before the goddess,  praised her, and said: "O\nGoddess, since I could not have Lotus-lake as my husband in this life, may he\nbe my husband in some other life!" And she made a noose of her garment, and\ntied it to the ashoka tree before the goddess.\n\nAt that moment her trusty friend awoke, and not finding her in the room,\nhunted about and came luckily into the garden. There she saw the girl\nfastening the noose about her neck, and she cried, "No, no!" And running up,\nshe cut the noose.\n\nWhen Love-cluster saw that it was her own friend who had run up and taken the\nnoose away, she fell to the ground in great agony. But her friend comforted\nher and asked the reason of her sorrow. Then she arose and said: "Jasmine, my\nfriend, I cannot be united with him I love. I am dependent on my father and\nother people. Death is the happiest thing for me."\n\nAnd as she spoke, she was terribly scorched by the fiery darts of love, and\ndetermined to feel no more hope, and fainted. And her friend Jasmine lamented:\n"Alas! Love is a hard master. It has reduced her to this condition." But she\ngradually brought her back to life with cool water and fans and things. She\nmade an easy bed of lotus-leaves. She put pearls cool as snow on her heart.\n\nThen Love-cluster came to herself and slowly said to her weeping friend: "My\ndear, the fire within me cannot be quenched by such things as pearls. If you\nwant to save my life, be clever enough to bring my lover to me."\n\nAnd the loving Jasmine said: "My dear, the night is almost over. In the\nmorning I will bring your lover here to meet you. Be brave and go now to your\nroom."\n\nLove-cluster was contented. She took the pearls from her neck and gave them to\nher friend as a present. And she said: "Let us go now. Then in the morning you\nmust keep your promise." So she went to her room.\n\nIn the morning Jasmine crept out without being seen to hunt for the house of\nLotus-lake. When she got there, she found Lotus-lake under a tree in the\ngarden. He was lying on a couch of lotus-leaves moistened with sandal, and the\nfriend who knew his secret was fanning him with plantain-leaf fans, for he was\ntortured by the flames of love. And Jasmine hid, to find out whether this was\nlovesickness for her friend or not.\n\nThen the friend said to Lotus-lake: "My friend, comfort your heart by glancing\na moment at this charming garden. Do not be so troubled."\n\nBut he said to his friend: "My heart has been stolen by Love-cluster. It is no\nlonger in my body. How can I comfort it? Love has made an empty quiver of me.\nSo invent some plan by which I may meet the thief of my heart."\n\nThen Jasmine came out joyfully and without fear and showed herself. And she\nsaid: "Sir, Love-cluster has sent me to you, and I am the bearer of a message\nto you. Is it good manners to enter the heart of an innocent girl by force,\nsteal her thoughts, and run away? It is strange, but the sweet girl is ready\nto give her person and her life to you, her charmer. For day and night she\nheaves sighs hot as the smoke from the fire of love that burns in her heart.\nAnd teardrops carry her rouge away and fall, like bees longing for the honey\nof her lotus-face. So, if you wish it, I will tell you what is good for both\nof you."\n\nAnd Lotus-lake said: "My good girl, the words which tell me that my love is\nlonely and longing, frighten me and comfort me. You are our only refuge.\nDevise a plan."\n\nAnd Jasmine answered: "This very night I will bring Love-cluster secretly to\nthe garden. You must be outside. Then I will cleverly let you in, and so you\ntwo will be united." Thus Jasmine delighted the Brahman\'s son, and went away\nsuccessful to please Love-cluster with the news.\n\nThen the sun and the daylight fled away, pursuing the twilight. And the East\nadorned her face with the moon. And the white night-blooming lotuses laughed,\ntheir faces expanding at the thought of the glory that was coming to them. At\nthat hour the lover Lotus-lake came secretly, adorned and filled with longing,\nto the garden-gate of his beloved. And Jasmine led Love-cluster secretly into\nthe garden, for she had lived through the day somehow.\n\nThen Jasmine made her sit down under the mango trees, while she went and let\nLotus-lake in. So he entered and looked upon Love-cluster as the traveller\nlooks upon the shade of trees with thick foliage. And as he drew near, she saw\nhim and ran to him, for love took away her modesty, and she fell on his neck.\n"Where would you go? I have caught you, thief of my heart!" she cried. Then\nexcessive joy stopped her breathing and she died. She fell on the ground like\na vine broken by the wind. Strange are the mysterious ways of Love.\n\nWhen Lotus-lake saw that terrible fall, he cried: "Oh, what does it mean?" And\nhe fainted and fell down. Presently he came to himself, and took his darling\non his lap. He embraced her and kissed her and wept terribly. He was so borne\ndown by the terrible burden of grief that his own heart broke. And when they\nwere both dead, the night seemed to die away in shame and fear.\n\nIn the morning the relatives heard the story from the gardeners, and came\nthere filled with timidity and wonder and grief and madness. They did not know\nwhat to do, but stood a long time with downcast eyes. Unfaithful women\ndisgrace a family.\n\nPresently the husband Jewel-guard came back from his father\'s house in Copper\nCity, filled with love for Love-cluster. When he came to his father-in-law\'s\nhouse and saw the business, he was blinded by tears and went thoughtfully into\nthe garden. There he saw his wife dead in another man\'s arms, and his body was\nscorched by flames of grief, and he died immediately.\n\nThen the whole household shouted and screamed so that all the citizens heard\nthe story and came there. The demi-gods themselves were filled with pity and\nprayed to the goddess Gauri whose image had been set up there before by Love-\ncluster\'s father: "Oh, Mother, the merchant who set up this statue was always\ndevoted to you. Show mercy to him in his affliction."\n\nAnd the gracious goddess heard their prayer. She said: "All three shall live\nagain, and shall forget their love." Then through her grace they all arose\nlike people waking from sleep. They were alive, and their love was gone. While\nall the people there rejoiced at what had happened. Lotus-lake went home,\nbending his head in shame. And the merchant took his shamefaced daughter and\nher husband and went into the house and made a feast.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story on the road in the night, he said: "O\nKing, which was the most foolish among those who died for love? If you know\nand do not tell, you must remember the curse I spoke of before."\n\nThen the king answered: "O magic creature, Jewel-guard was the most foolish of\nthem. When he saw that his wife had died for love of another man, he should\nhave been angry. Instead, he was loving, and died of grief."\n\nThen the goblin slipped from the king\'s shoulder and quickly set out for his\nhome. And the king ran after him again, eager as before.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Twentieth Goblin: The Four Brothers who brought a Dead Lion to Life.\nWhich is to blame when he kills them all?](ttg21.htm)\n\n'
