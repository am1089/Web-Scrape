He then lays down those _Kh_ andasyas 2 (relating to the metres).\nFor Pra _g_ apati, having freed himself from evil, death, asked for food;\nhence, to this day, a sick man, when he gets better, asks for food; and people\nhave hope for him, thinking, 'He asks for food, he will live.' The gods gave\nhim that food, these (bricks) relating to the metres; for the metres are\ncattle, and cattle are food. They (the metres) pleased him, and inasmuch as\nthey pleased ( _kh_ and) him they are (called) metres ( _kh_ andas).\n\n8:5:2:22\\. He lays them down by tens,--the Vira _g_ consists of ten syllables,\nand all food is 'vira _g_ '\n\np. 88\n\n[paragraph continues] (shining, or ruling): he thus bestows all food on him.\nOn all (four) sides he places them: from all sides he thus bestows food on\nhim.\n\n8:5:2:33\\.

Now of those which he lays down in front, the first is the out (and\nin)-breathing, the second the through-breathing, the third the up-breathing,\nthe fourth the up-breathing, the fifth the through-breathing, the sixth the\nout-breathing, the seventh the out-breathing, the eighth the through-\nbreathing, the ninth the up-breathing, and the tenth, in this case, is the\nSacrificer himself: this same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established\non this Vira _g_ (brick), made up of breath, lays down (bricks) extending both\nbackward and forward, for the breathings move both backward and forward.\n\n8:5:2:88\\. And of those on the right (south) side, the first is Agni (fire),\nthe second Vayu (the wind), the third \xc3\x82ditya (the sun), the fourth \xc3\x82ditya, the\nfifth Vayu, the sixth Agni, the seventh Agni, the eighth Vayu, the ninth\n\xc3\x82ditya, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same\nSacrificer, being raised and firmly established on this Vira _g_ , made up of\ndeities, puts on (bricks) extending both hitherwards and thitherwards, for\nthose gods move both hitherwards and thitherwards.\n\n8:5:2:99\\. And of those behind, the first is this (terrestrial) world, the\nsecond the air, the third the sky, the fourth the sky, the fifth the air, the\nsixth this world, the seventh this world, the eighth the air, the ninth the\nsky, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same\nSacrificer, being raised and firmly established on that Vira _g_ made up of\nthe worlds, lays down (bricks) extending both hitherwards and\nthitherwards;--whence these worlds extend both hitherwards and thitherwards.\n\n8:5:2:1010\\. And of those on the left (north) side, the first is the summer,\nthe second the rainy season, the\n\np. 91\n\nthird the winter, the fourth the winter, the fifth the rainy season, the sixth\nthe summer, the seventh the summer, the eighth the rainy season, the ninth the\nwinter, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same\nSacrificer, being raised and firmly established on that Vira _g_ , made up of\nthe seasons, lays down (bricks) extending both hitherwards and\nthitherwards;--whence those seasons move both hitherwards and thitherwards 1.\n\n8:5:2:1111\\. And, again, those which he lays down in front are the vital airs.\nThere are ten of them, for there are ten vital airs. He places them in the\nfront part, for these vital airs are in the front part.\n\n8:5:2:1212\\. And those on the right (south) side are the deities,--Agni, the\nEarth, Vayu, the Air, \xc3\x82ditya, the Sky, _K_ andra (the moon), the Stars, Food,\nand Water.\n\n8:5:2:1313\\. And those behind are the regions (quarters),--four regions, four\nintermediate regions, the upper region, and this (earth).\n\n8:5:2:1414\\. And those on the left (north) side are the months,--two spring-\nmonths, two summer-months, two months of the rainy season, two autumn-months,\nand two winter-months.\n\n8:5:2:1515\\. And, again, the first ten are this (terrestrial) world, the\nsecond the air, the third the sky. By the first set of ten they (the gods)\nascended this (earth), by the second the air, by the third the sky; and in\nlike manner does the Sacrificer now, by the first set of ten, ascend this\n(earth), by the second the air, and by the third the sky.\n\n8:5:2:1616\\. This, then, is, as it were, an ascent away from\n\np. 92\n\nhere; but this (earth) is the foundation: the gods came back to this (earth),\nthe foundation; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now come back to this\n(earth), the foundation. And that last set of ten is this world: hence, even\nas (takes place) that start from the first set of ten, so from the last; for\nthis is the same,--those two sets of ten (the first and last) are this\n(terrestrial) world.\n\n8:5:2:1717\\. Now these are forty bricks and forty formulas,--that makes\neighty, and eighty (a _s_ iti) means food 1: thus whatever he now says that he\nmakes to be food, a _s_ iti, and gives it him, and thereby gratifies him\n(Agni).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[87:2](sbe4320.htm#fr_174) The _Kh_ andasya or Vira _g_ bricks are laid down\nat the end of the spines, ten in each quarter.\n\n[88:1](sbe4320.htm#fr_175) A word of doubtful meaning (? drinking its own\nwindings).\n\n[89:1](sbe4320.htm#fr_176) Another word of doubtful meaning (? winding-\nwinding).\n\n[91:1](sbe4320.htm#fr_177) That is to say, they come and go.\n\n[92:1](sbe4320.htm#fr_178) The author apparently connects 'a _s_ iti' with the\nroot 'a _s_ ,' to eat.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 5, 3.
