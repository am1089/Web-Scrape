The gods Agni, Indra, Soma, Makha, Vish _n_ u, and the Vi _s_ ve\nDeva _h_ , except the two A _s_ vins, performed a sacrificial session 1.\n\n14:1:1:22\\. Their place of divine worship was Kurukshetra.. Therefore people\nsay that Kurukshetra is the gods' place of divine worship: hence wherever in\nKurukshetra one settles there one thinks, 'This is a place for divine\nworship;' for it was the gods' place of divine worship.\n\n14:1:1:33\\. They entered upon the session 2 thinking, 'May we attain\nexcellence! may we become glorious! may we become eaters of food!' And in like\nmanner do these (men) now enter upon the sacrificial session thinking, 'May we\nattain excellence! may we become glorious! may we become eaters of food!'\n\n14:1:1:44\\. They spake, 'Whoever of us, through austerity, fervour, faith,\nsacrifice, and oblations, shall first compass the end of the sacrifice, he\nshall be the most excellent of us, and shall then be in common to us all.' 'So\nbe it,' they said.\n\n14:1:1:55\\. Vish _n_ u first attained it, and he became the\n\np. 442\n\nmost excellent of the gods; whence people say, 'Vish _n_ u is the most\nexcellent of the gods.'\n\n14:1:1:66\\. Now he who is this Vish _n_ u is the sacrifice; and he who is this\nsacrifice is yonder \xc3\x82ditya (the sun). But, indeed, Vish _n_ u was unable to\ncontrol that (love of) glory of his; and so even now not every one can control\nthat (love of) glory of his.\n\n14:1:1:77\\. Taking his bow, together with three arrows, he stepped forth. He\nstood, resting his head on the end of the bow. Not daring to attack him, the\ngods sat themselves down all around him.\n\n14:1:1:88\\. Then the ants said--these ants (vamri), doubtless, were that (kind\ncalled) 'upadika 1'--'What would ye give to him who should gnaw the\nbowstring?'--'We would give him the (constant) enjoyment of food, and he would\nfind water even in the desert: so we would give him every enjoyment of\nfood.'--'So be it,' they said.\n\n14:1:1:99\\. Having gone nigh unto him, they gnawed his bowstring. When it was\ncut, the ends of the bow, springing asunder, cut off Vish _n_ u's head.\n\n14:1:1:1010\\. It fell with (the sound) 'gh _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85'; and on falling it became\nyonder sun. And the rest (of the body) lay stretched out (with the top part)\ntowards the east. And inasmuch as it fell with (the sound) 'gh _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85,'\ntherefrom the Gharma 2 (was called); and inasmuch as he was stretched out\n(pra-v _ri_ _g_ ,), therefrom the Pravargya (took its name).\n\n14:1:1:1111\\. The gods spake, 'Verily, our great hero\n\np. 443\n\n[paragraph continues] (mahan vira _h_ ) has fallen:' therefrom the Mahavira\npot (was named). And the vital sap which flowed from him they wiped up (sam-m\n_ri_ _g_ ) with their hands, whence the Samra _g_  1.\n\n14:1:1:1212\\. The gods rushed forward to him, even as those eager to secure\nsome gain (will do) 2. Indra reached him first. He applied himself to him limb\nafter limb, and encompassed him 3, and, in encompassing him, he became\n(possessed of) that glory of his. And, verily, he who knows this becomes\n(possessed of) that glory which Indra is (possessed of).\n\n14:1:1:1313\\. And Makha (sacrifice), indeed, is the same as Vish _n_ u: hence\nIndra became Makhavat (possessed of makha), since Makhavat is he who is\nmystically called Maghavat 4, for the gods love the mystic.\n\n14:1:1:1414\\. They gave to those ants the enjoyment of food; but, indeed, all\nfood is water, for it is by moistening (the food) therewith that one eats here\nwhatever one does eat.\n\n14:1:1:1515\\. This Vish _n_ u, the (Soma-) sacrifice, they then divided\namongst themselves into three parts: the Vasus (received) the morning-\npressing, the Rudras the midday-pressing, and the \xc3\x82dityas the third pressing.\n\n14:1:1:1616\\. Agni (received) the morning-pressing, Indra\n\np. 444\n\nthe midday-pressing, and the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ the third pressing.\n\n14:1:1:1717\\. The Gayatri (received) the morning-pressing, the Trish _t_ ubh\nthe midday-pressing, and the _G_ agati the third pressing. The gods went on\nworshipping and toiling with that headless sacrifice.\n\n14:1:1:1818\\. Now Dadhya _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a knew this pure essence 1, this\nSacrifice,--how this head of the Sacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice\nbecomes complete.\n\n14:1:1:1919\\. He then was spoken to by Indra saying, 'If thou teachest this\n(sacrificial mystery) to any one else, I shall cut off thy head.'\n\n14:1:1:2020\\. Now this was heard by the A _s_ vins,--'Verily, Dadhya _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\n\xc3\x82tharva _n_ a knows this pure essence, this Sacrifice,--how this head of the\nSacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice becomes complete.'\n\n14:1:1:2121\\. They went up to him and said, 'We two will become thy\npupils.'--'What are ye wishing to learn?' he asked.--'This pure essence, this\nSacrifice,--how this head of the Sacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice\nbecomes complete,' they replied.\n\n14:1:1:2222\\. He said, 'I was spoken to by Indra saying, 'If thou teachest\nthis to any one else, I shall cut off thy head;' therefore I am afraid lest he\nshould indeed cut off my head: I cannot take you as my pupils.'\n\n14:1:1:2323\\. They said, 'We two shall protect thee from him.'--'How will ye\nprotect me?' he replied.--They said, 'When thou wilt have received us as thy\n\np. 445\n\npupils, we shall cut off thy head and put it aside elsewhere; then we shall\nfetch the head of a horse, and put it on thee: therewith thou wilt teach us;\nand when thou wilt have taught us, then Indra will cut off that head of thine;\nand we shall fetch thine own head, and put it on thee again.'--'So be it,' he\nreplied.\n\n14:1:1:2424\\. He then received them (as his pupils); and when he had received\nthem, they cut off his head, and put it aside elsewhere; and having fetched\nthe head of a horse, they put it on him: therewith he taught them; and when he\nhad taught them, Indra cut off that head of his; and having fetched his own\nhead, they put it on him again,\n\n14:1:1:2525\\. Therefore it is concerning this that the _Ri_ shi has said (\n_Ri_ g-v. I, 116, 12), 'That Dadhya _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a, with a horse's\nhead, anywise spoke forth unto you two the sweet doctrine:'--'Unrestrainedly\nhe spoke this,' is what is thereby meant.\n\n14:1:1:2626\\. One must not teach this to any and every one, since that would\nbe sinful, and lest Indra should cut off his head; but one may only teach it\nto one who is known to him, and who has studied sacred writ, and who may be\ndear to him, but not to any and every one.\n\n14:1:1:2727\\. He may teach it to one dwelling with him (as a pupil) for a\nyear; for the year is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that\n(sun): it is him he thereby gratifies, and therefore he may teach it to one\ndwelling with him for a year.\n\n14:1:1:2828\\. For three nights he keeps the rule (of abstinence); for there\nare three seasons in the year, and the year is he that shines yonder, and the\nPravargya also is that one: it is him he thereby\n\np. 446\n\ngratifies, and therefore he keeps the rule for three nights.\n\n14:1:1:2929\\. Hot 1 (water) he sips, thinking, 'I will teach it as one\npractising austerities.' He teaches it whilst abstaining from flesh-food,\nthinking, 'I will teach it as one practising austerities;'\n\n14:1:1:3030\\. And whilst not drinking out of earthen (vessels); for whatever\nuntruth (man) speaks on this (earth) is, as it were, immixed with her:\ntherefore (one should do so) whilst not drinking out of earthen (vessels);\n\n14:1:1:3131\\. And whilst not coming into contact with _S_ udras and remains of\nfood; for this Gharma is he that shines yonder, and he is excellence, truth,\nand light; but woman, the _S_ udra, the dog, and the black bird (the crow),\nare untruth: he should not look at these, lest he should mingle excellence and\nsin, light and darkness, truth and untruth.\n\n14:1:1:3232\\. And, verily, he that shines yonder is glory; and as to that\nglory, \xc3\x82ditya (the sun), that glory is just the sacrifice; and as to that\nglory, the sacrifice, that glory is just the Sacrificer; and as to that glory,\nthe Sacrificer, that glory is just the officiating priests; and as to that\nglory, the officiating priests, that glory is just the sacrificial gifts:\nhence, if they bring up to him a dakshi _n_ a he must not, at least on the\nsame day, make over these (objects) to any one else lest he should make over\nto some one else that glory which has come to him; but rather on the morrow,\nor the day after: he thus gives it away after having made that glory his own,\nwhatever it be--gold, a cow, a garment, or a horse.\n\np. 447\n\n14:1:1:3333\\. And, verily, he who either teaches or partakes of this\n(Pravargya), enters that life, and that light. The observance of the rule\nthereof (is as follows). Let him not cover himself (with a garment) whilst the\nsun shines, lest he should be concealed from that (sun). Let him not spit\nwhilst the sun shines, lest he should spit upon him. Let him not discharge\nurine whilst the sun shines, lest he discharge it upon him. For so long as he\nshines, so great he (the sun) is: thinking, 'Lest I should injure him by these\n(acts),' let him take food at night, after striking a light, whereby it is\nmade to be a form of him who shines yonder. But on this point \xc3\x82suri used to\nsay,--One rule the gods indeed keep, to wit, the truth: let him therefore\nspeak nothing but the truth.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[441:1](sbe44117.htm#fr_1177) For this legend, see J.
