On account of (the Self) standing in a complementary relation, they are\narthavadas, as in other cases; thus _G_ aimini opines.\n\nWhat has been said as to Scripture intimating that a beneficial result is\nrealised through the meditations by themselves is untenable. For texts such as\n'he who knows Brahman reaches the Highest' do not teach that the highest aim\nof man is attained through knowledge; their purport rather is to inculcate\nknowledge of Truth on the part of a Self which is the agent in works\nprescribed. Knowledge,\n\np. 687\n\ntherefore, stands in a complementary relation to sacrificial works, in so far\nas it imparts to the acting Self a certain mystic purification; and the texts\nwhich declare special results of knowledge, therefore, must be taken as mere\narthavadas. 'As in the case of other things; so _G_ aimini thinks,' i.e. as\n_G_ aimini holds that in the case of substances, qualities, and so on, the\nscriptural declaration of results is of the nature of arthavada.--But it has\nbeen shown before that the Vedanta-texts represent as the object to be\nattained, by those desirous of Release, on the basis of the knowledge imparted\nby them, something different from the individual Self engaged in action; cp.\non this point Su. I, 1, 15; I, 3, 5; I, 2, 3; I, 3, 18. And Su. II, 1, 22 and\nothers have refuted the view that Brahman is to be considered as non-different\nfrom the personal soul, because in texts such as 'thou art that' it is\nexhibited in co-ordination with the latter. And other Sutras have proved that\nBrahman must, on the basis of numerous scriptural texts, be recognised as the\ninner Self of all things material and immaterial. How then can it be said that\nthe Vedanta-texts merely mean to give instruction as to the true nature of the\nactive individual soul, and that hence all meditation is merely subservient to\nsacrificial works?--On the strength of numerous inferential marks, the\nPurvapakshin replies, which prove that in the Vedanta-texts all meditation is\nreally viewed as subordinate to knowledge, and of the declarations of co-\nordination of Brahman and the individual soul (which must be taken to imply\nthat the two are essentially of the same nature), we cannot help forming the\nconclusion that the real purport of the Vedanta-texts is to tell us of the\ntrue nature of the individual soul in so far as different from its body.--But,\nagain it is objected, the agent is connected no less with ordinary worldly\nworks than with works enjoined by the Veda, and hence is not invariably\nconnected with sacrifices (i.e. works of the latter type); it cannot,\ntherefore, be maintained that meditations on the part of the agent necessarily\nconnect themselves with sacrifices in so far as they effect a purification of\nthe sacrificer's mind!--There\n\np. 688\n\nis a difference, the Purvapakshin rejoins. Worldly works can proceed also if\nthe agent is non-different from the body; while an agent is qualified for\nsacred works only in so far as he is different from the body, and of an\neternal non-changing nature. Meditations, therefore, properly connect\nthemselves with sacrifices, in so far as they teach that the agent really is\nof that latter nature. We thus adhere to the conclusion that meditations are\nconstituents of sacrificial actions, and hence are of no advantage by\nthemselves.--But what then are those inferential marks which, as you say,\nfully prove that the Vedanta-texts aim at setting forth the nature of the\nindividual soul?--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3.
