What belongs to this world, there being no obstruction at hand; as this\nis seen.\n\nKnowledge, as enjoined by Scripture, is twofold, having\n\np. 713\n\nfor its fruit either exaltation within the sphere of the Sa _m_ sara, or final\nRelease. With regard to the former the question arises whether it springs up\nonly immediately subsequent to the good works which are the means to bring it\nabout; or, indefinitely, either subsequent to such works or at some later\ntime.--The Purvapakshin holds the former view. A man reaches knowledge through\nhis good deeds only, as the Lord himself declares, 'Four kinds of men doing\ngood works worship me,' &c.(Bha. Gi. VII, 16); and when those works have been\naccomplished there is no reason why the result, i.e. knowledge, should be\ndelayed.--This view the Sutra disposes of. 'What is comprised in this world,'\ni.e. meditation, the result of which is worldly exaltation, springs up\nimmediately after the works to which it is due, in case of there being no\nother works of greater strength obstructing the rise of knowledge; but if\nthere is an obstruction of the latter kind, knowledge springs up later on\nonly. 'For this is seen,' i.e. Scripture acknowledges the effects of such\nobstruction; for a statement such as ' what he does with knowledge, with\nfaith, with the Upanishad that is more vigorous,' means that works joined with\nthe knowledge of the Udgitha, and so on, produce their results without\nobstruction (which implies that the action of other works is liable to be\nobstructed).--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'what belongs to this\nworld.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 51.
