Brahma\n_n_ as of the Kurus and the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ kalas had come thither, and _G_ anaka\nVaideha wished to know, which of those Brahma _n_ as was the best read. So he\nenclosed a thousand cows, and ten padas (of gold) 2 were fastened to each pair\nof horns.\n\n2\\. And _G_ anaka spoke to them: 'Ye venerable Brahma _n_ as, he who among you\nis the wisest, let him drive away these cows.'\n\nThen those Brahma _n_ as durst not, but Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said to his pupil:\n'Drive them away, my dear.'\n\nHe replied: 'O glory of the Saman 3' and drove them away.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ as became angry and said: 'How could he call himself the wisest\namong us?'\n\nNow there was A _s_ vala, the Hot _ri_ priest of _G_ anaka Vaideha. He asked\nhim: 'Are you indeed the\n\np. 122\n\nwisest among us, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya?' He replied: 'I bow before the wisest\n(the best knower of Brahman), but I wish indeed to have these cows.'\n\nThen A _s_ vala, the Hot _ri_ priest, undertook to question him.\n\n1\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, he said, 'everything here (connected with the\nsacrifice) is reached by death, everything is overcome by death. By what means\nthen is the sacrificer freed beyond the reach of death?'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'By the Hot _ri_ priest, who is Agni (fire), who is\nspeech. For speech is the Hot _ri_ of the sacrifice (or the sacrificer), and\nspeech is Agni, and he is the Hot _ri_. This constitutes freedom, and perfect\nfreedom (from death).'\n\n4\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'everything here is reached by day and\nnight, everything is overcome by day and night. By what means then is the\nsacrificer freed beyond the reach of day and night?'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'By the Adhvaryu priest, who is the eye, who is\n\xc3\x82ditya (the sun) 1. For the eye is the Adhvaryu of the sacrifice, and the eye\nis the sun, and he is the Adhvaryu. This constitutes freedom, and perfect\nfreedom.'\n\n5\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'everything here is reached by the waxing\nand waning of the moon, everything is overcome by the waxing and waning of the\nmoon. By what means then is the sacrificer freed beyond the reach of the\nwaxing and waning of the moon?'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'By the Udgat _ri_ priest, who is Vayu (the wind),\nwho is the breath. For the\n\np. 123\n\nbreath is the Udgat _ri_ of the sacrifice, and the breath is the wind, and he\nis the Udgat _ri_. This constitutes freedom, and perfect freedom.'\n\n6\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'this sky is, as it were, without an ascent\n(staircase.) By what approach does the sacrificer approach the Svarga world?'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'By the Brahman priest, who is the mind (manas), who\nis the moon. For the mind is the Brahman of the sacrifice, and the mind is the\nmoon, and he is the Brahman. This constitutes freedom, and perfect freedom.\nThese are the complete deliverances (from death).'\n\nNext follow the achievements.\n\n7\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'how many _Ri_ _k_ verses will the Hot _ri_\npriest employ to-day at this sacrifice?'\n\n'Three,' replied Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\n'And what are these three?'\n\n'Those which are called Puronuvakya, Ya _g_ ya, and, thirdly, _S_ asya 1.'\n\n'What does he gain by them?'\n\n'All whatsoever has breath.'\n\n8\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'how many oblations (ahuti) will the\nAdhvaryu priest employ to-day at this sacrifice?'\n\n'Three,' replied Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\n'And what are these three?'\n\n'Those which, when offered, flame up; those which, when offered, make an\nexcessive noise; and those which, when offered, sink down 2.'\n\np. 124\n\n'What does he gain by them?'\n\n'By those which, when offered, flame up, he gains the Deva (god) world, for\nthe Deva world flames up, as it were. By those which, when offered, make an\nexcessive noise, he gains the Pit _ri_ (father) world, for the Pit _ri_ world\nis excessively (noisy) 1. By those which, when offered, sink down, he gains\nthe Manushya (man) world, for the Manushya world is, as it were, down below.'\n\n9\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'with how many deities does the Brahman\npriest on the right protect to-day this sacrifice?'\n\n'By one,' replied Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\n'And which is it?'\n\n'The mind alone; for the mind is endless, and the Vi _s_ vedevas are endless,\nand he thereby gains the endless world.'\n\n10\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'how many Stotriya hymns will the Udgat\n_ri_ priest employ to-day at this sacrifice?'\n\n'Three,' replied Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\n'And what are these three?'\n\n'Those which are called Puronuvakya, Ya _g_ ya, and, thirdly, _S_ asya.'\n\n'And what are these with regard to the body (adhyatmam)?'\n\n'The Puronuvakya is Pra _n_ a (up-breathing), the Ya _g_ ya the Apa _n_ a\n(down-breathing), the _S_ asya the Vyana (back-breathing).'\n\np. 125\n\n'What does he gain by them?'\n\n'He gains the earth by the Puronuvakya, the sky by the Ya _g_ ya, heaven by\nthe _S_ asya.'\n\nAfter that A _s_ vala held his peace.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[121:1](sbe15064.htm#fr_384) Madhyandina text, p. 1067.\n\n[121:2](sbe15064.htm#fr_385) Pala _k_ aturbhaga _h_ pada _h_ suvar _n_ asya.\nComm.\n\n[121:3](sbe15064.htm#fr_386) One expects iti after uda _g_ a, but Sama _s_\nravas is applied to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, and not to the pupil. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya, as the commentator observes, was properly a teacher of the Ya _g_ ur-\nveda, but as the pupil calls him Samasravas, he shows that Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nknew all the four Vedas, because the Samans are taken from the _Ri_ g-veda,\nand the Atharva-veda is contained in the other three Vedas. Regnaud, however,\nrefers it to the pupil, and translates, '\xc3\x94 toi qui apprends le Sama-veda.'\n\n[122:1](sbe15064.htm#fr_387) One expects adityena _k_ akshusha, instead of _k_\nakshushadityena, but see \xc2\xa7 6.\n\n[123:1](sbe15064.htm#fr_388) The Puronuvakyas are hymns employed before the\nactual sacrifice, the Ya _g_ yas accompany the sacrifice, the _S_ asyas are\nused for the _S_ astra. All three are called Stotriyas.\n\n[123:2](sbe15064.htm#fr_389) These oblations are explained as consisting of\nwood and oil, of flesh, and of milk and Soma. The first, when thrown on the p.\n124 fire, flame up. The second, when thrown on the fire, make a loud hissing\nnoise. The third, consisting of milk, Soma, &c., sink down into the earth.\n\n[124:1](sbe15064.htm#fr_390) On account of the cries of those who wish to be\ndelivered out of it.
