They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-cow were to milk blood,\nwhat rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him say\n'Disperse!' and having made a stirring-spoon, let him order the Anvaharya-pa\n_k_ ana fire to be enclosed; and having boiled that (blood) thereon, let him\nsilently offer it in an undefined (indistinct) way 1, for Pra _g_ apati is\nundefined, and the Agnihotra is sacred to Pra _g_ apati; and the undefined\nalso means everything: he thus makes atonement with everything. At this\noffering he should give that (cow) to a Brahma _n_ a whom he does not intend\nto visit; for, indeed, she who milks blood milks it after perceiving the\nSacrificer's suffering and evil: he thus fastens that suffering and evil upon\nthis (Brahma _n_ a). Let him then make offering with what other milk he can\nprocure: by that which is not unsound he thus throws out what is unsound in\nthe sacrifice. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:2:22\\. They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure\n2 whilst being milked, what rite and what expiation would there be in that\ncase?' Now some think that it should be offered\n\np. 184\n\n[paragraph continues] (arguing that) it is ready (for offering), and it would\nbe improper if it were not offered; and that the gods have no loathing for\nanything. But the gods have indeed loathings:--let him rather proceed in the\nfollowing way. Having shifted some hot cinders from the Garhapatya, let him\nsilently pour that (milk) on these hot cinders. He then pours water thereon,\nand thus secures (ap) it by means of the water (ap). Let him then make\noffering with what other (milk) he can procure. This, then, is the rite\nperformed in that case.\n\n12:4:2:33\\. They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure\nafter he has had it milked, what rite and what expiation would there be in\nthat case?' Let him shift back the coals which were shifted away (from the\nfire) and on which he was going to put (the Agnihotra-milk); and let him then\npour it silently on these hot cinders. He then pours water thereon, and\nsecures it by means of the water. Let him then make offering with what other\n(milk) he can procure.\n\n12:4:2:44\\. They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure\nafter being put on the fire, what rite and what expiation would there be in\nthat case?' Let him offer it silently on the coals which were shifted away\n(from the fire), and on which it had been placed: thus it is both offered and\nnot offered; for inasmuch as he offers it on those (hot coals) it is offered,\nand inasmuch as he extinguishes it along with them it is not offered. He pours\nwater thereon, and secures it by means of the water. Let him then make\noffering with what other (milk) he can procure.\n\n12:4:2:55\\. They also say, 'If the Sacrificer were to die\n\np. 185\n\nwhen the Agnihotra-milk has been put on the fire, what rite and what expiation\nwould there be in that case?' Having enclosed it, let him pour it out: and\nsuch, indeed, they say, is the expiation (in that case) for every Havirya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:2:66\\. They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to be spilled\nafter being ladled out into the offering-spoon, what rite and what expiation\nwould there be in that case?' Let him touch it with the (formula of) atonement\nfor spilling, and, having poured water thereon, let him make offering with\nwhat (milk) there is left. And if the spoon be turned upside down, or if it\nwere to break, let him touch (the spilled milk) with the (formula of)\natonement for spilling, and, having poured water thereon, let him make\noffering with what (milk) is left in the pot.\n\n12:4:2:77\\. Now some go back (to the Garhapatya) and make offering with what\n(milk) is left in the pot; but let him not do this, for, indeed, that\nAgnihotra is conducive to heaven, and if any one, in that case, were to say of\nhim, 'Surely, this one has descended again from the heavenly world: this\n(offering) will be in no wise conducive to heaven for him,' then that would\nindeed be likely to come to pass.\n\n12:4:2:88\\. Let him rather do it in this way:--let him sit down there and\nthen, and let them ladle out and bring to him what (milk) there is left in the\npot. Now some perplex him, saying, 'Surely, this (milk) is the remainder of an\noffering; surely, this is exhausted: offering should not be made thereof;' but\nlet him give no heed to this; for, surely, when that (milk) is of unexhausted\nstrength it is used for\n\np. 186\n\ncurdling the offering-material 1: let them therefore ladle out and bring to\nhim what (milk) there is left in the pot; and if there should not be any in\nit, let him put on the fire what other (milk) he can procure; and when he has\nmade the light fall on it 2, and poured water to it, and taken it off (the\nfire),--then on that (former) occasion 3 he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'I will ladle\nout 4;' but on the present occasion let them ladle it out in the way it is\n(there) ladled out and bring it to him; and let him by all means make offering\ntherewith. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:2:99\\. They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure\nafter it has been ladled into the offering-spoon, what rite and what expiation\nwould there be in that case?' Now some think it should be offered, on the\nground that it is ready (for offering), and it would be improper if it were\nnot offered, for the gods have no loathing for anything. And some fill it to\noverflowing and let it flow off 5; but let him not do this; for if, in that\ncase, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (priest) has poured away the\nAgnihotra: this Sacrificer will be poured away,' then that would indeed be\nlikely to come to pass. Let him rather do it in this way:--let him put\n\np. 187\n\nfuel on the \xc3\x82havaniya, and, having shifted some hot cinders away from the\n\xc3\x82havaniya, let him silently pour it on these hot cinders. He then pours water\non it, and secures it by means of the water; and let him then make offering\nwith what other (milk) he can procure. This, then, is the rite performed in\nthat case.\n\n12:4:2:1010\\. They also say, 'If it were to rain upon (uparish _t_ at) any\none's Agnihotra-milk when it has been ladled into the offering-spoon, what\nrite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him know, 'Light (or\nsap) has come to me from above (uparish _t_ at); the gods have helped me: I\nshall become more glorious;' and let him by all means make offering therewith.\nThis, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[183:1](sbe44059.htm#fr_514) According to Katy. XXV, 2, 2, it is to be offered\non hot cinders of the Dakshi _n_ agni with the formula, 'To Rudra, hail!'\n\n[183:2](sbe44059.htm#fr_515) Or rather, perhaps,--if anything impure were to\nget (to fall) into any one's Agnihotra-milk; cf. [XII, 4, 2,\n9](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:9).\n\n[186:1](sbe44059.htm#fr_516) Literally, they make it the means of curdling the\nhavis;--cf. [XI, 1, 4, 1](sbe44006.htm#11:1:4:1), where the sour milk from\nlast night's milking is so used. In the same way the milk not used for the\nAgnihotra might have served for curdling next morning's milk.\n\n[186:2](sbe44059.htm#fr_517) Viz. by means of a lighted straw, cf. II, 3, 1,\n16.\n\n[186:3](sbe44059.htm#fr_518) Viz. at the evening-offering of the Agnihotra;\nthe Sacrificer then replying, 'Om, ladle out!' At the morning-offering the\nAdhvaryu says, 'I ladle out,' instead. Cf. part i, p. 331, note 1.\n\n[186:4](sbe44059.htm#fr_519) Or, 'shall I ladle out?' as the Paddhati on Katy.\nIV, 14, 8 takes it.\n\n[186:5](sbe44059.htm#fr_520) That is to say, they let the impure matter flow\noff.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 4, 3.
