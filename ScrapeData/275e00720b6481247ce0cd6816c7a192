But whilst the Wuzeer had much judgment and\ndiscretion, as well as a brilliant fancy, the Rajab was too apt to allow his\nimagination to run away with his reason.\n\nUnder their united rule, however, the kingdom prospered greatly. The Rajah was\nthe spur of every noble work, and .the Wuzeer the curb to every rash or\nimpracticable project.\n\nIn a country some way from Rajah Vicram\'s there lived a little Queen, called\nAnar Ranee (the Pomegranate Queen). Her father and mother reigned over the\nPomegranate country, and for her they made a beautiful garden. In the middle\nof the garden was a lovely pomegranate tree, bearing three large pomegranates.\n\nThey opened in the centre, and in each was a little bed. In one of them Anar\nRanee used to sleep, and in the pomegranates on either side slept two of her\nmaids.\n\nEvery morning early the pomegranate tree would bend its branches gently to the\nground, and the fruit would open, and Anar Ranee and her attendants creep out\nto play under the shadow of the cool tree until the evening; and each evening\nthe tree again bent down to enable them to get into their tiny, snug bedrooms.\n\nMany princes wished to marry Anar Ranee, for she was said to be the fairest\nlady upon earth. Her hair was black as a raven\'s wing, her eyes like the eyes\nof a gazelle, her teeth two rows of exquisite pearls, and her cheeks the\ncolour of the rosy pomegranate. But her father and mother had caused her\ngarden to be hedged round with seven hedges made of bayonets, so that none\ncould go in or out; and they had published a decree that none should marry her\nbut he who could enter the garden and gather the three pomegranates in which\nshe and her two maids slept. To do this, kings, princes, and nobles\ninnumerable had striven, but striven in vain.\n\nSome never got past the first sharp hedge of bayonets; others, more fortunate,\nsurmounted the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, or even the sixth;\nbut there perished miserably, being unable to climb the seventh. None had ever\nsucceeded in entering the garden.\n\nBefore Vicram Maharajah\'s father and mother died, they had built, some way\nfrom their palace, a very beautiful temple. It was of marble, and in the\ncentre stood an idol made of pure gold. But in course of time the jungle had\ngrown up round it, and thick straggling plants of prickly pear had covered it,\nso that it was difficult even to find out whereabouts it was.\n\nThen one day, the Wuzeer Butti said to Vicram Maharajah, \'The temple your\nfather and mother built at so much pains and cost is almost lost in the\njungle, and will probably ere long be in ruins. It would be a pious work to\nfind it out and restore it.\' Vicram Maharajah agreed, and immediately sent for\nmany workmen, and caused the jungle to be cut down, and the temple restored.\nAll were much astonished to find what a beautiful place it was! The floor was\nof white marble, the walls exquisitely carved in bas-reliefs and gorgeously\ncoloured, while all over the ceiling was painted Vicram Maharajah\'s father\'s\nname, and in the centre was a golden image of Gunputti, to whom the temple was\ndedicated.\n\nThe Rajah Vicram was so pleased with the beauty of the place, that on that\naccount, as well as because of its sanctity, he and Butti used to go and sleep\nthere every night.\n\nOne night whilst there Vicram had a wonderful dream. He dreamed his father\nappeared to him and said, \'Arise, Vicram, go to the tower for lights  3 which\nis in front of this temple.\'\n\n(For there was in front of the temple a beautiful tower or pyramid for lights,\nand all the way up it were projections on which to place candles on days\ndedicated to the idol; so that when the whole was lighted, it looked like a\ngigantic candlestick, and to guard it there were around it seven hedges made\nof bayonets.)\n\n\'Arise, Vicram, therefore,\' said the vision, \'go to the tower for lights;\nbelow it is a vast amount of treasure, but you can only get it in one way\nwithout incurring the anger of Gunputti. You must first do in his honour an\nact of very great devotion, which if he graciously approve, and consent to\npreserve your life therein, you may with safety remove the treasure.\'\n\n\'And what is this act of devotion?\' asked Vicram Maharajah.\n\n\'It is this.\' (He thought his father answered.) \'You must fasten a rope to the\ntop of the tower, and to the other end of the rope attach a basket, into which\nyou must get head downwards, then twist the rope by which the basket is hung\nthree time; and as it is untwisting, cut it, when you will fall head downwards\nto the earth.\n\n\'If you fall on either of the hedges of bayonets, you will be instantly\nkilled; but Gunputti is merciful--do not fear that he will allow you to be\nslain. If you escape unhurt, you will know that he has accepted your pious\nact, and may without danger take the treasure."\n\nThe vision faded, Vicram saw no more, and shortly afterwards he awoke.\n\nThen turning to the Wuzeer he said, \'Butti, I had a strange dream. I dreamed\nmy father counselled me to do an act of great devotion, nothing less than\nfastening a basket by a rope to the top of the tower for lights, and getting\ninto it head downwards, then cutting the rope and allowing myself to fall; by\nwhich, having propitiated the divinity, he promised me a vast treasure, to be\nfound by digging under the tower! What do you think I had better do?\'\n\n\'My advice,\' answered the Wuzeer, \'is, if you care to seek the treasure, to do\nentirely as your father commanded, trusting in the mercy of Gunputti.\'\n\nSo the Rajah caused a basket to be fastened by a rope to the top of the tower,\nand got into it head downwards; then he called out to Butti, \'How can I cut\nthe rope?\' \'Nothing is easier,\' answered he; \'take this sword in your hand. I\nwill twist the rope three times, and as it untwists for the first time let the\nsword fall upon it.\' Vicram Maharajah took the sword, and Butti twisted the\nrope, and as it first began to untwist the Rajah cut it, and the basket\nimmediately fell. It would have certainly gone down among the bayonets, and he\nbeen instantly killed, had not Gunputti, seeing the danger of his devotee,\nrushed out of the temple at that moment, in the form of an old woman, who,\ncatching the basket in her arms before it touched the bayonets, brought it\ngently and safely to the ground; having done which she instantly returned into\nthe temple. None of the spectators knew she was Gunputti himself in disguise,\nthey only thought \'what a clever old woman!\'\n\nVicram Maharajah then caused excavations to be made below the tower, under\nwhich he found an immense amount of treasure. There were mountains of gold,\nthere were diamonds, and rubies, and sapphires, and emeralds, and turquoise,\nand pearls; but he took none of them, causing all to be sold and the money\ngiven to the poor, so little did he care for the riches for which some men\nsell their bodies and souls.\n\nAnother day, the Rajah, when in the temple, dreamed again. Again his father\nappeared to him, and this time he said, \'Vicram, come daily to this temple and\nGunputti will teach you wisdom, and you shall get understanding. You may get\nlearning in the world, but wisdom is the fruit of much learning and much\nexperience, and much love of God and man; wherefore, come, acquire wisdom, for\nlearning perishes, but wisdom never dies.\' When the Rajah awoke, he told his\ndream to the Wuzeer, and Butti recommended him to obey his father\'s counsel,\nwhich he accordingly did.\n\nDaily he resorted to the temple and was instructed by Gunputti; and when he\nhad learnt much, one day Gunputti said to him, \'I have given you as much\nwisdom as is in keeping with~ man\'s finite comprehension; now, as a parting\ngift, ask of me what you will and it shall be yours--or riches, or power, or\nbeauty or long life, or health, or happiness--only choose what you will have.\'\nThe Rajah was very much puzzled, and he begged leave to be allowed a day to\nthink over the matter and make his choice, to which Gunputti assented.\n\nNow it happened that near the palace there lived the son of a Carpenter, who\nwas very cunning, and when he heard that the Rajah went to the temple to learn\nwisdom, he also determined to go and see if he could not learn it also; and\neach day when Gunputti gave Vicram Maharajah instruction, the Carpenter\'s son\nwould hide close behind the temple, and overhear all their conversation, so\nthat he also became very wise. No sooner, therefore, did he hear Gunputti\'s\noffer to Vicram, than he determined to return again when the Rajah did, and\nfind out in what way he was to procure the promised gift, whatever it were.\n\nThe Rajah consulted Butti as to what he should ask for, saying, \'I have riches\nmore than enough, I have also sufficient power, and for the rest I had sooner\ntake my chance with other men, which makes me much at a loss to know what to\nchoose.\'\n\nThe Wuzeer answered, \'Is there any supernatural power you at all desire to\npossess? If so, ask for that.\' \'Yes,\' replied the Rajah, \'it has always been a\ngreat desire of mine to have power to leave my own body when I will, and\ntranslate my soul and sense into some other body, either of man or animal. I\nwould rather be able to do that than anything else.\' \'Then,\' said the Wuzeer,\n\'ask Gunputti to give you the power.\'\n\nNext morning the Rajah, having bathed and prayed, went in great state to the\ntemple to have his final interview with the Idol. And the Carpenter\'s son went\ntoo, in order to overhear it.\n\nThen Gunputti said to the Rajah, \'Vicram, what gift do you choose?\' \'O divine\npower,\' answered the Rajah, \'you have already given me a sufficiency of wealth\nand power in making me Rajah; neither care I for more of beauty than I now\npossess; and of long life, health, and happiness, I had rather take my share\nwith other men. But there is a gift which I would rather own than all that you\nhave offered.\'\n\n\'Name it, O good son of a good father,\' said Gunputti.\n\n\'Most Wise,\' replied Vicram, \'give me the power to leave my own body when I\nwill, and translate my soul and sense and thinking powers into any other body\nthat I may choose, either of man or bird or beast--whether for a day, or a\nyear, or for twelve years, or as long as I like; grant also that however long\nthe term of my absence my body may not decay, but that whenever I return to it\nagain I may find it still as when I left it.\'\n\n\'Vicram,\' answered Gunputti, \'your prayer is heard,\' and he instructed Vicram\nMaharajah by what means he should translate his soul into another body, and\nalso gave him something, which, being placed within his own body when he left\nit, would preserve it from decay until his return.  4\n\nThe Carpenter\'s son, who had been all this time listening outside the temple,\nheard and learnt the spell whereby Gunputti gave Vicram Maharajah power to\nenter into any other body; but he could not see nor find out what was given to\nthe Rajah to place within his own body when he left it to preserve it, so that\nhe was only master of half the secret.\n\nVicram Maharajah returned home, and told the Wuzeer that he was possessed of\nthe much-desired knowledge. \'Then,\' said Butti, \'the best use you can put it\nto, is to fly to the Pomegranate country, and bring Anar Ranee here.\'\n\n\'How can that be done?\' asked the Rajah. \'Thus,\' replied Butti; \'transport\nyourself into the body of a parrot, in which shape you will be able to fly\nover the seven hedges of bayonets that surround her garden. Go to the tree in\nthe centre of it, bite off the stalks of the pomegranates and bring them home\nin your beak.\'\n\n\'Very well,\' said the Rajah, and he picked up a parrot which lay dead on the\nground, and placing within his own body the beauty-preserving charm,\ntransported his soul into the parrot and flew off.\n\nOn, on, on he went, over the hills and far away, until he came to the garden.\nThen he flew over the seven hedges of bayonets, and with his beak broke off\nthe three pomegranates (in which were Anar Ranee and her two ladies) and\nholding them by the stalks brought them safely home. He then immediately left\nthe parrot\'s body and re-entered his own body.\n\nWhen Butti saw how well he had accomplished the feat, he said, \'Thank heaven\nthere\'s some good done already.\' All who saw Anar Ranee were astonished at her\nbeauty, for she was fair as a lotus-flower, and the colour on her cheeks was\nlike the deep rich colour of a pomegranate, and all thought the Rajah very\nwise to have chosen such a wife.\n\nThey had a magnificent wedding, and were for a short time as happy as the day\nis long.\n\nBut within a little while Vicram Maharajah said to Butti, \'I have again a\ngreat desire to see the world.\'\n\n\'What!\' said Butti, \'so soon again to leave your home! So soon to care to go\naway from your young wife!\'\n\n\'I love her and my people dearly,\' answered the Rajah; \'but I cannot help\nfeeling that I have this supernatural power of taking any form I please, and\nlonging to use it\'\n\n\'Where and how will you go?\' asked the Wuzeer.\n\n\'Let it be the day after to-morrow,\' answered Vicram Maharajah. \'I shall again\ntake the form of a parrot, and see as much of the world as possible.\'\n\nSo it was settled that the Rajah should go. He left his kingdom in the\nWuzeer\'s sole charge, and also his wife, saying to her, \'I don\'t know for how\nlong I may be away; perhaps a day, perhaps a year, perhaps more. But if, while\nI am gone, you should be in any difficulty, apply to the Wuzeer. He has ever\nbeen like an elder brother or a father to me; do you therefore also regard him\nas a father. I have charged him to take care of you as he would of his own\nchild.\'\n\nHaving said these words, the Rajah caused a beautiful parrot to be shot (it\nwas a very handsome bird, with a tuft of bright feathers on its head and a\nring about its neck). He then cut a small incision in his arm and rubbed into\nit some of the magic preservative given him by Gunputti to keep his body from\ndecaying, and, transporting his soul into the parrot\'s body, he flew away.\n\nNo sooner did the Carpenter\'s son hear that the Rajah was as dead, than,\nknowing the power of which Vicram Maharajah and he were alike possessed, he\nfelt certain that the former had made use of it, and determined himself\nlikewise to turn it to account. Therefore, directly the Rajah entered the\nparrot\'s body, the Carpenter\'s son entered the Rajah\'s body, and the world at\nlarge imagined that the Rajah had only swooned and recovered. But the Wuzeer\nwas wiser than they, and immediately thought to himself, \'Some one besides\nVicram Maharajah must have become acquainted with this spell, and be now\nmaking use of it, thinking it would be very amusing to play the part of Rajah\nfor a while; but I\'ll soon discover if this be the case or no.\'\n\nSo he called Anar Ranee, and said to her, \'You are as well assured as I am\nthat your husband left us but now in the form of a parrot; but scarcely had he\ngone before his deserted body arose, and he now appears walking about, and\ntalking, and as much alive as ever; nevertheless, my opinion is, that the\nspirit animating the body is not the spirit of the Rajah, but that some one\nelse is possessed of the power given to him by Gunputti, and has taken\nadvantage of it to personate him. This we must try and discover. Do therefore\nas I tell you, that we may put the matter to proof. Make to-day for your\nhusband\'s dinner some very coarse and common currie, and give it to him. If he\ncomplains that it is not as good as usual, I am making a mistake; but if, on\nthe contrary, he says nothing about it, you will know that my words are true,\nand that he is not Vicram Maharajah.\'\n\nAnar Ranee did as the Wuzeer advised, and afterwards came to him and said,\n\'Father\' (for so she always called him), \'I have been much astonished at the\nresult of the trial. I made the currie very carelessly, and it was as coarse\nand common as possible; but the Rajah did not even complain. I feel convinced\nit is as you Say; but what can we do?\'\n\n\'We will not,\' answered the Wuzeer, \'cast him into prison, since he inhabits\nyour husband\'s body; but neither you nor any of the Rajah\'s relations must\nhave any friendship with, or so much as speak to him; and if he speak to any\nof you, let whoever it be immediately begin to quarrel with him, whereby he\nwill find the life of a Rajah not so agreeable as he anticipated, and may be\ninduced the sooner to return to his proper form.\'\n\nAnar Ranee instructed all her husband\'s relations and friends as Butti had\nadvised, and the Carpenter\'s son began to think the life of a Rajah not at all\nas pleasant as he had fancied, and would, if he could, have gladly returned to\nhis own body again; but, having no power to preserve it, his spirit had no\nsooner left it than it began to decay, and at the end of three days was quite\ndestroyed; so that he had no alternative but to remain where he was.\n\nMeantime the real Vicram Maharajah had flown, in the form, of a parrot, very\nfar, far away, until he reached a large banyan tree, where there were a\nthousand other pretty pollies, whom he joined, making their number a thousand\nand one. Every day the parrots flew away to get food, and every night they\nreturned to roost in the great banyan tree.\n\nNow it chanced that a hunter had often gone through that part of the jungle,\nand noticed the banyan tree and the parrots, and said to himself \'If I could\nonly catch the thousand and one parrots that nightly roost in that tree, I\nshould not be so often hungry as I am now, for they would make plenty of very\nnice currie.\' But he could not do it, though he frequently tried; for the\ntrunks of the trees were tall and straight, and very slippery, so that he no\nsooner climbed up a little way than he slid down again: however, he did not\ncease to look and long.\n\nOne day a heavy shower of rain drove all the parrots back earlier than usual\nto their tree, and there they found a thousand crows, who had come on their\nhomeward flight to shelter themselves till the storm was over.\n\nThen Vicram Maharajah Parrot said to the other parrots, \'Do you not see these\ncrows have all sorts of seeds and fruits in their beaks, which they were\ncarrying home to their little ones? Let us quickly drive them away, lest some\nof these fall down under our tree, which, being sown there, will spring up\nstrong plants and twine round the trunks, and enable our enemy the hunter to\nclimb up with ease and kill us all\'\n\nBut the other parrots answered, \'That is a very far-fetched idea! Do not let\nus hunt the poor birds away from shelter in this pouring rain, they will get\nso wet\' So the crows were not molested. It turned out, however, iust as Vicram\nMaharajah had foretold; for some of the fruits and seeds they were taking home\nto their young ones fell under the tree, and the seeds took root and sprang up\nstrong creeping plants, which twined all round the straight trunks of the\nbanyan-tree, and made it very easy to climb.\n\nNext time the hunter came by he noticed this, and saying, my fine friends,\nI\'ve got you at last,\' he, by the help of the creepers, climbed the tree, and\nset one thousand and one snares of fine thread among the branches, having done\nwhich he went away.\n\nThat night when the parrots flew down on the branches as usual, they found\nthemselves all caught fast prisoners by the feet.\n\n\'Crick! crick! crick!\' cried they, \'crick! crick! crick! O dear! O dear! what\nshall we do? what can we do? O Vicram Maharajah, you were right and we were\nwrong. O dear! O dear! crick! crick! crick!\'\n\nThen Vicram said, \'Did I not tell you how it would be? But do as I bid you,\nand we may yet be saved. So soon as the hunter comes to take us away, let each\none of us hang his head down on one side, as if he were dead; then, thinking\nus dead, he will not trouble himself to wring our necks, or stick the heads of\nthose he wishes to keep alive through his belt, as he otherwise would, but\nwill merely release us and throw us on the ground. Let us when there remain\nperfectly still, till the whole thousand and one are set free, and the hunter\nbegins to descend the tree; then we will all fly up over his head and far out\nof sight.\'\n\nThe parrots agreed to do as Vicram Maharajah Parrot proposed, and when the\nhunter came next morning to take them away, every one of them had his eyes\nshut and his head hanging down on one side, as if he were dead. Then the\nhunter said, \'All dead, indeed! Then I shall have plenty of nice currie.\' And\nso saying, he cut the noose that held the first and threw him down. The parrot\nfell like a stone to the ground, so did the second, the third, the fourth, the\nfifth, the sixth, the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, and so on up\nto the thousandth parrot. Now the thousand-and-first chanced to be none other\nthan Vicram;--all were released but he. But, just as the hunter was going to\ncut the noose round his feet, he let his knife fall, and had to go down and\npick it up again. When the thousand parrots who were on the ground heard him\ncoming down they thought, \'The thousand and one are all released, and here\ncomes the hunter; it is time for us to be off.\' And with one accord they flew\nup into the air and far out of sight, leaving poor Vicram Maharajah still a\nprisoner!\n\nThe hunter seeing what had happened, was very angry, and seizing Vicram, said\nto him, \'You wretched bird, it\'s you that have worked all this mischief! I\nknow it must be, for you are a stranger here, and different from the other\nparrots. I\'ll strangle you, at all events--that I will!\' But to his surprise\nthe parrot answered, \'Do not kill me. What good will that do you? Rather sell\nme in the next town. I am very handsome. You will get a thousand gold mohurs,\'\nfor me.\'\n\n\'A thousand gold mohurs!\' answered the hunter, much astonished. \'You silly\nbird, who\'d be so foolish as to give a thousand gold mohurs for a parrot?\n\n\'Never mind,\' said Vicram, \'only take me and try.\'\n\nSo the hunter took him into the town, crying, \'Who\'ll buy? who\'ll buy? Come\nbuy this pretty poliy that can talk so nicely! See how handsome he is; see\nwhat a great red ring he has round his neck! Who \'ll buy? who \'ll buy?\'\n\nThen several people asked how much he would take for the parrot; but when he\nsaid a thousand gold mohurs, they all laughed and went away, saying, \'None but\na fool would give so much for a bird.\'\n\nAt last the hunter got angry, and he said to Vicram, \'I told you how it would\nbe. I shall never be able to sell you.\' But he answered, \'Oh yes, you will.\nSee, here comes a merchant down this way; I dare say he will buy me.\' So the\nhunter went to the merchant and said to him, \'Pray, sir, buy my pretty\nparrot.\' \'How much do you want for him?\' asked the merchant, \'two rupees?" 5\n\'No, sir,\' answered the hunter, \'I cannot part with him for less than a\nthousand gold mohurs.\' \'A thousand gold mohurs!\' cried the merchant, \'a\nthousand gold mohurs! I never heard of such a thing in my life I A thousand\nmohurs for one little wee poily! Why, with that sum you might buy a house, or\ngardens, or horses, or ten thousand yards of the best cloth. Who\'s going to\ngive you such a sum for a parrot? Not I indeed. I\'ll give you two rupees and\nno more.\' But Vicram called out, \'Merchant, merchant, do not fear to buy me. I\nam Vicram Maharajah Parrot Pay what the hunter asks, and I will repay it to\nyou; buy me only, and I will keep your shop.\'\n\n\'Polly,\' answered the merchant, \'what nonsense you talk!\' But he took a fancy\nto the bird, and paid the hunter a thousand gold mohurs, and taking Vicram\nMaharajah home, hung him up in his shop.\n\nThen the Parrot took on him the duties of shop-man, and talked so much and so\nwisely, that every one in the town soon heard of the merchant\'s wonderful\nbird. Nobody cared to go to any other shop--all came to his shop, only to hear\nthe Parrot talk; and he sold them what they wanted, and they did not care how\nmuch he charged for what he sold, but gave him whatever he asked; insomuch\nthat in one week the merchant had gained a thousand gold mohurs over and above\nhis usual weekly profits; and there Vicram Maharajah Parrot lived for a long\ntime, made much of by everybody, and very happy.\n\nIt happened in the town where the merchant lived there was a very accomplished\nNautch-girl, named Champa Ranee.  6She danced so beautifully, that the people\nof the town used always to send for her to dance on the occasion of any great\nfestival.\n\nThere also lived in the town a poor woodcutter, who earned his living by going\ndaily far out into the jungle to cut wood, and bringing it into the bazaar to\nsell.\n\nOne day he went out as usual into the jungle to cut wood, and, being tired, he\nfell asleep under a tree and began to dream; and he dreamed that he was a very\nrich man, and that he married the beautiful Nautch-girl, and that he took her\nhome to his house, and gave his wife, as a wedding present, a thousand gold\nmohurs!\n\nWhen he went into the bazaar that evening as usual to sell wood, he began\ntelling his dream to his friends, saying, \'While I was in the jungle I had\nsuch an absurd dream! I dreamed that I was a rich man, and that I married the\nChampa Ranee, and gave her as a wedding present a thousand gold mohurs!\'\n\n\'What a funny dream!\' they cried, and thought no more about it.\n\nBut it happened that the house by which he was standing whilst talking to his\nfriends was Champa Ranee\'s house, and Champa Ranee herself was near the\nwindow, and heard what he said, and thought to herself, \'For all that man\nlooks so poor, he has then a thousand gold mohurs, or he would not have\ndreamed of giving them to his wife; if that is all, I\'ll go to law about it,\nand see if I can\'t get the money.\'\n\nSo she sent out her servants and ordered them to catch the poor woodcutter,\nand when they caught him, she began crying out, \'O husband! husband! here have\nI been waiting ever so long, wondering what has become of you; where have you\nbeen all this time?\' He answered, \'I\'m sure I don\'t know what you mean. You\'re\na great lady, and I\'m a poor woodcutter; you must mistake me for somebody\nelse.\'\n\nBut she answered, \'Oh no! don\'t you remember we were married on such and such\na day? Have you forgotten what a grand wedding it was? and you took me home to\nyour palace, and promised to give me as a wedding present a thousand gold\nmohurs! but you quite forgot to give me the money, and you went away, and I\nreturned to my father\'s house till I should learn tidings of you; how can you\nbe so cruel?\'\n\nThe woodcutter thought he must be dreaming; but all Champa Ranee\'s friends and\nrelations declared that what she said was true. Then after much quarrelling\nthey said they would go to law about it; but the judge could not settle the\nmatter, and referred it to the Rajah himself. The Rajah was no less puzzled\nthan the judge. The woodcutter protested that he was only a poor woodcutter;\nbut Champa Ranee and her friends asserted that he was, on the contrary, a rich\nman, her husband, and had possessed much money, which he must have squandered.\nShe offered, however, to give up all claim to that if he would only give her a\nthousand gold mohurs, which he had promised her as a wedding present; and so\nsuggested a compromise. The woodcutter replied that he would gladly give the\ngold mohurs if he had them; but that (as he brought witnesses to prove) he was\nreally and truly what he professed to be, only a poor woodcutter, who earned\ntwo annas\' a day cutting wood, and had neither palace, nor riches, nor wife in\nthe world! The whole city was interested in this curious case, and all\nwondered how it would end; some being sure one side was right, and some\nequally certain of the other.\n\nThe Rajah could make nothing of the matter, and at last he said, \'I hear there\nis a merchant in this town who has a very wise parrot--wiser than most men\nare; let him be sent for to decide this business, for it is beyond me; we will\nabide by his decision.\'\n\nSo Vicram Maharajah Parrot was sent for, and placed in the Court of Justice,\nto hear and judge the case.\n\nFirst he said to the woodcutter, \'Tell me your version of the story.\' And the\nwoodcutter answered, \'Polly, Sahib, what I tell is true. I am a poor man. I\nlive in the jungle, and earn my living by cutting wood and selling it in the\nbazaar. I never get more than two annas  7 a day. One day I fell asleep and\ndreamed a silly dream; how I had become rich and married the Champa Ranee, and\ngiven her as a wedding present a thousand gold mohurs; but it is no more true\nthat I owed her a thousand goldi mohurs, or have them to pay, than that I\nmarried her.\'\n\n\'That is enough,\' said Vicram Maharajah. \'Now, Dancing-girl, tell us your\nstory.\' And Champa Ranee gave her version of the matter. Then the Parrot said\nto her, \'Tell me now where was the house of this husband of yours to which he\ntook you?\' \'Oh!\' she answered, \'very far away--I don\'t know how far--in the\njungles.\' \'How long ago was it?\' asked he. \'At such and such a time,\' she\nreplied. Then he called credible and trustworthy witnesses, who proved that\nChampa Ranee had never left the city at the time she mentioned. After hearing\nwhom, the Parrot said to her, \'Is it possible that you can have the folly to\nthink any one would believe that you would leave your rich and costly home to\ngo a long journey into the jungle? It is now satisfactorily proved that you\ndid not do it; you had better give up all claim to the thousand gold mohurs.\'\n\nBut this the Nautch-girl would not do. The Parrot then called for a money-\nlender, and begged of him the loan of a thousand gold mohurs, which he placed\nin a great bottle, putting the stopper in and sealing it securely down; he\nthen gave it to the Nautch-girl, and said, \'Get this money if you can without\nbreaking the seal or breaking the bottle.\' She answered, \'It cannot be done.\'\n\'No more,\' replied Vicram Maharajah, \'can what you desire be done. You cannot\nforce a poor man who has no money in the world to pay you a thousand gold\nmohurs. Let the prisoner go free! Begone, Champa Ranee! Dancing-girl, you are\na liar and a thief; go rob the rich if you will, but meddle no more with the\npoor.\'\n\nAll applauded Vicram Maharajah Parrot\'s decision, and said, \'Was ever such a\nwonderful bird!\' But Champa Ranee was extremely angry, and said to him, \'Very\nwell, nasty polly--nasty stupid polly! be assured before long I will get you\nin my power, and when I do, I will bite off your head!\'\n\n\'Try your worst, madam,\' answered Vicram; \'but in return, I tell you this; I\nwill live to make you a beggar. Your house shall be, by your own order, laid\neven with the ground, and you for grief and rage shall kill yourself.\'\n\n\'Agreed,\' said Champa Ranee, \'we will soon see whose words come true, mine or\nyours,\' and so saying, she returned home.\n\nThe merchant took Vicram Maharajah back to his shop, and a week passed without\nadventure; a fortnight passed, but still nothing particular happened. At the\nend of this time the merchant\'s eldest son was married, and in honour of the\noccasion the merchant ordered that a clever dancing-girl should be sent for to\ndance before the guests. Champa Ranee came, and danced so beautifully that\nevery one was delighted; and the merchant was much pleased, and said to her,\n\'You have done your work very well, and in payment you may choose what you\nlike out of my shop, or house, and it shall be yours--whether jewels, or rich\ncloths, or whatever it is.\'\n\nShe replied, \'I desire nothing of the kind; of jewels and rich stuffs I have\nmore than enough, but you shall give me your pretty little parrot; I like it\nmuch, and that is the only payment I will take.\'\n\nThe merchant felt very much vexed, for he had never thought the Nautch-girl\nwould ask for the parrot of which he was so fond, and which had been so\nprofitable to him; he felt that he would rather have parted with anything he\npossessed than that: nevertheless, having promised, he was bound to keep his\nword; so, with many tears, he went to fetch his favourite. But Polly cried,\n\'Don\'t be vexed, master; give me to the girl; I can take good care of myself.\'\n\nSo Champa Ranee took Vicram Maharajah Parrot home with her; and no sooner did\nshe get there, than she sent for one of her maids, and said, \'Quick, take this\nparrot and boil him for my supper, but first cut off his head and bring it to\nme on a plate, grilled; for I will eat it before tasting any other dish.\'\n\n\'What nonsensical idea is this of our mistress?\' said the maid to another, as\nshe took the parrot into the kitchen; \'to think of eating a grilled parrot\'s\nhead!\' \'Never mind,\' said the other; \'you \'d better prepare it as she bids\nyou, or she \'ll be very cross.\' Then the maid who had received the order began\nplucking the long feathers out of Vicram Maharajah\'s wings, he all the time\nhanging down his head, so that she thought he was dead. Then, going to fetch\nsome water in which to boil him, she laid him down close to the place where\nthey washed the dishes. Now, the kitchen was on the ground-floor, and there\nwas a hole right through the wall, into which the water used in washing the\ndishes ran, and through which all the scraps, bones, peelings, and parings\nwere washed away after the daily cooking; and in this hole Vicram Maharajah\nhid himself, quick as thought.\n\n\'Oh dear! oh dear!\' cried the maid when she returned; \'what can I do? what\nwill my mistress say? I only turned my back for one moment, and the parrot\'s\ngone.\' \'Very likely,\' answered the other maid, \'some cat has taken it away. It\ncould not have been alive, and flown or run away, or I should have seen it go;\nbut never fear, a chicken will do instead.\'\n\nThen they took a chicken and boiled it, and grilled the head and took it to\ntheir mistress; and she ate it, little bit by little bit, saying as she did\nso--\'Ah, pretty Polly I so here\'s the end of you! This is the brain that\nthought so cunningly, and devised my overthrow! this is the tongue that spoke\nagainst me! this is the throat through which came the threatening words! Aha!\nwho is right now, I wonder!\'\n\nVicram, in the hole close by, heard her, and felt very much frightened; for he\nthought, \'If she should catch me after all I\' He could not fly away, for all\nhis wing-feathers had been pulled out; so there he had to stay some time,\nliving on the scraps that were washed into the hole in the washing of the\nplates, and perpetually exposed to the danger of being drowned in the streams\nof water that were poured through it. At last, however, his new feathers were\nsufficiently grown to bear him, and he flew away to a little temple in the\njungle some way off, where he perched behind the Idol.\n\nIt happened that Champa Ranee used to go to that temple, and he had not been\nthere long before she came there to worship her Idol.\n\nShe fell on her knees before the image, and began to pray. Her prayer was that\nthe god would transport her, body and soul, to Heaven (for she had a horror of\ndying), and she cried, \'Only grant my prayer--only let this be so, and I will\ndo anything you wish--anything--anything.\'\n\nVicram Maharajah, who was hidden behind the image, heard her, and\nsaid--\'Champa Ranee Nautch-girl, your prayer is heard!\' (She thought the Idol\nhimself was speaking to her, and listened attentively.) \'This is what you must\ndo: sell all you possess, and give the money to the poor; you must also give\nmoney to all your servants, and dismiss them. Level also your house to the\nground, that you may be wholly separated from earth. Then you will be fit for\nHeaven. Come, having done all I command you, on this day week to this place,\nand you shall be transported thither body and soul.\'\n\nChampa Ranee believed what she heard, and, forgetful of Vicram Maharajah\nParrot\'s threat, hastened to do as she was bidden. She sold her possessions,\nand gave all the money to the poor; razed her house to the ground, and\ndismissed her servants, which being accomplished, on the day appointed she\nwent to the temple, and sat on the edge of a well outside it, explaining to\nthe assembled people how the Idol himself had spoken to her, and how they\nwould shortly see her caught up to Heaven, and thus her departure from the\nworld would be even more celebrated than her doings whilst in it. All the\npeople listened eagerly to her words, for they believed her inspired, and to\nsee her ascension the whole city had come out, with hundreds and hundreds of\nstrangers and travellers, princes, merchants, and nobles, from far and near,\nall full of expectation and curiosity.\n\nThen, as they waited, a fluttering of little wings was heard, and a parrot\nflew over Champa Ranee\'s head, calling out, \'Nautchgirl! Nautch-girl! what\nhave you done?\' Champa Ranee recog.nised the voice as Vicram\'s; he went on--\'\nWill you go body and soul to Heaven? have you forgotten Polly\'s words?\'\n\nChampa Ranee rushed into the temple, and, falling on her knees before the\nIdol, cried out, \'Gracious Power, I have done all as you commanded; let your\nwords come true; save me; take me to Heaven.\'\n\nBut the Parrot above her cried, \'Good-bye, Champa Ranee, good-bye; you ate a\nchicken\'s head, not mine. Where is your house now? where your servants and all\nyour possessions? Have my words come true, think you, or yours?\'\n\nThen the woman saw all, and in her rage and despair, cursing her own folly,\nshe fell violently down on the floor of the temple, and, dashing her head\nagainst the stone, killed herself.\n\nIt was now two years since the Rajah Vicram left his kingdom; and about six\nmonths before, Butti, in despair of his ever returning, had set out to seek\nfor him. Up and down through many countries had he gone, searching for his\nmaster; but without success. As good fortune would have it, however, he\nchanced to be one of those strangers who had come to witness the Nautch-girl\'s\ntranslation, and no sooner did he see the Parrot which spoke to her, than in\nhim he recognised Vicram. The Rajah also saw him, and flew on to his shoulder,\nupon which Butti caught him, put him in a cage, and took him home.\n\nNow was a puzzling problem to be solved. The Rajah\'s soul was in the parrot\'s\nbody, and the Carpenter\'s son\'s soul \'in the Rajah\'s body. How was the latter\nto be expelled to make way for the former? He could not return to his own\nbody, for that had perished long before. The Wuzeer knew not how to manage the\nmatter, and determined therefore to await the course of events.\n\nIt happened that the pretended Rajah and Butti had each a fighting ram, and\none day the Rajah said to the Wuzeer, \'Let us set our rams to fight to-day,\nand try the strength of mine against yours.\' \'Agreed,\' answered the Wuzeer;\nand they set them to fight. But there was much difference in the two rams; for\nwhen Buttj\'s ram was but a lamb, and his horns were growing, Butti had tied\nhim to a lime-tree, and his horns had got very strong indeed by constantly\nrubbing against its tender stem, and butting against it; but the Carpenter\'s\nson had tied his ram, when a lamb, to a young teak-tree, the trunk of which\nwas so stout and strong, that the little creature, butting against it, could\nmake no impression on it, but only damaged and loosened his own horns.\n\nThe pretended Rajah soon saw, to his vexation, that his favourite\'s horns\nbeing less strong than its opponent\'s, he was getting tired, and, beginning to\nlose courage, would certainly be worsted in the fight; so, quick as thought,\nhe left his own body and transported his soul into the ram\'s body, in order to\ngive it an increase of courage and resolution, and enable it to win.\n\nNo sooner did Vicram -Maharajab, who was hanging up in a cage, see what had\ntaken place, than he left the parrot\'s body and re-entered his own body. Then\nButti\'s ram pushed the other down on its knees, and the Wuzeer ran and fetched\na sword, and cut off its head; thus putting an end with the life of the ram to\nthe life of the Carpenter\'s son.\n\nGreat was the joy of Anar Ranee and all the household at recovering the Rajah\nafter his long absence; and Anar Ranee prayed him to fly away no more as a\nparrot, which he promised her he would not do.\n\nBut the taste for wandering, and love of an unsettled life, did not leave him\non his resuming his proper form; and one of the things in which he most\ndelighted was to roam about the jungles near the Palace by himself, without\nattendant or guide. One very sultry day, when he was thus out by himself, he\nwandered over a rocky part of the country, which was flat and arid, without a\ntree upon it to offer shelter from the burning sun. Vicram, tired with his\nwalk, threw himself down by the largest piece of rock he could find to rest.\nAs he lay there, half asleep, a little Cobra came out of a hole in the ground,\nand, seeing his mouth wide open (which looked like some shady cranny in a\nrock), crept in and curled himself up in the Rajah\'s throat.\n\nVicram Maharajah called out to the Cobra, \'Get out of my throat!\' But the\nCobra said, \'No, I won\'t go; I like being here better than under ground.\' And\nthere he stayed. Vicram didn\'t know what to do, for the Cobra lived in his\nthroat, and could not be got out. At times it would peep out of his mouth, but\nthe moment the Rajah tried to catch it, it ran back again.\n\n\'Who ever heard of a Rajah in such a miserable plight?\' sighed he to Butti;\n\'to think of having this Cobra in my throat!\'\n\n\'Ah, my dear friend!\' Butti would answer, \'why will you go roaming about the\ncountry by yourself; will you never be cured of it?\'\n\n\'If one could only catch this Cobra, I\'d be content to wander no more,\' said\nthe Rajah, \'for my wandering has not brought me much good of late.\' But to\ncatch the Cobra was more than any man could do. At last one day Vicram, driven\nnearly mad in this perplexity, ran away into the jungle. Tidings of this were\nsoon brought to Butti, who was much grieved to hear it, and sighed, saying,\n\'Alas, alas! of what avail to Vicram Maharajah is his more than human wisdom,\nwhen the one unlucky self-chosen gift neutralises all the good he might do\nwith it! It has given him a love of wandering hither and thither, minding\neverybody\'s business but his own; his kingdom is neglected, his people uncared\nfor, and he, that used to be the pride of all Rajahs, the best, the noblest,\nhas finally slunk out of his country, like a thief escaping from jail.\'\n\nButti sent messengers far and wide seeking Vicram Maharajah, but they could\nnot find him; be then determined to go himself in search of his lost friend;\nand having made proper arrangements for tile government of the country during\nhis absence, he set off on his travels.\n\nMeantime Vicram wandered on and on, until at last one day he came to the\nPalace of a certain Rajah, who reigned over a country very far from his own,\nand he sat down with the beggars at the Palace gate.\n\nNow, the Rajah at whose gate Vicram Maharajah sat had a good and lovely\ndaughter, named Buccoulee.  8 Many Princes wished to marry this Princess, but\nshe would marry none of them. Her father and mother said to her, \'Why will you\nnot choose a husband? Among all these Princes who ask you in marriage there\nare many rich and powerful--many handsome and brave--many wise and good; why\nwill you refuse them all?\' The Princess replied, \'It is not my destiny to\nmarry any of them; continually in my dreams I see my destined husband, and I\nwait for him.\' \'Who is he?\' they asked. \'His name,\' she answered, \'is the\nRajah Vicram; he will come from a very far country; he has not come yet.\' They\nreplied, \'There is no Rajah, far or near, that we know of, of this name; give\nover this fancy of yours and marry some one else.\'\n\nBut she constantly refused, saying, \'No, I will wait for the Rajah Vicram.\'\nHer parents thought, \'It may be even as she says--who knows but perhaps some\nday a great King, greater than any we know, may come to this country, and wish\nto marry the girl; we shall then be glad that we had not obliged her to marry\nany of her present suitors.\'\n\nNo sooner had Vicram Maharajah come to the Palace gate and sat down there with\nthe beggars, than the Princess Buccoulee, looking out of the window, saw him,\nand cried, \'There is the husband I saw in my dreams; there is the Rajah\nVicram.\' \'Where, child, where?\' said her mother; \'there\'s no Rajah there; only\na parcel of beggars.\'\n\nBut the Princess persisted that one of them was the Rajah Vicram. Then the\nRanee sent for Vicram Maharajah, and questioned him.\n\nHe said his name was \'Rajah Vicram.\' But the Rajah and Ranee did not believe\nhim; and they were very angry with the Princess because she persisted in\nsaying that him, and no other, would she marry. At last they got so enraged\nwith her, that they said, \'Well, marry your beggar husband if you will, but\ndon\'t think to remain any longer here as our daughter after becoming his wife;\nif you marry him it must be to follow his fortunes in the jungle; we shall\nsoon see you repent your obstinacy.\'\n\n\'I will marry him, and follow him wherever he goes,\' said the Princess.\n\nSo Vicram Maharajab and the Princess Buccoulee were married, and her parents\nturned her out of the house; nevertheless, they allowed her a little money,\nfor, they said, \'She will soon enough find the difference between a king\'s\ndaughter and a beggar\'s wife, without wanting food.\'\n\nVicram built a little hut in the jungle, and there they lived; but the poor\nPrincess had a sad time of it, for she was neither accustomed to cook nor\nwash, and the hard work tired her very much. Her chief grief, however, was\nthat Vicram should have such a hideous tormentor as the Cobra in his throat;\nand often and often of a night she sat awake, trying to devise some means for\ncatching it, but all in vain.\n\nAt last, one night when she was thinking about it, she saw, close by, two\nCobras come out of their holes, and as they began to talk she listened to hear\nwhat they would say.\n\n\'Who are these people?\' said the first Cobra.--\' These,\' said the second, \'are\nthe Rajah Vicram, and his wife the Princess Buccoulee.\'--\'What are they doing\nhere? why is the Rajah so far from his kingdom?\' asked the first Cobra.\n\n\'Oh, he ran away, because he was so miserable; he has a cobra that lives in\nhis throat,\' answered the second.\n\n\'Can no one get it out?\' said the first.\n\n\'No,\' replied the other; \'because they do not know the secret.\'--\' What\nsecret?\' asked the first Cobra.--\' Don\'t you know?\' said the second; \'why, if\nhis wife only took a few marking nuts,  9 and pounded them well, and mixed\nthem in cocoanut oil, and set the whole on fire, and hung the Rajah, her\nhusband, head downwards up in a tree above it, the smoke, rising upwards,\nwould instantly kill the Cobra in his mouth, which would tumble down dead.\'\n\n\'I never heard of that before,\' said the first Cobra.\n\n\'Didn\'t you?\' exclaimed the second; \'why, if they did the same thing at the\nmouth of your hole, they\'d kill you in no time; and then, perhaps, they might\nfind all the fine treasure you have there! \'--\'Don\'t joke in that way,\' said\nthe first Cobra, \'I don\'t like it;\' and he crawled away quite offended, and\nthe second Cobra followed him.\n\nNo sooner had the Princess heard this, than she determined to try the\nexperiment. So next morning she sent for all the villagers living near (who\nall knew and loved her, and would do anything she told them, because she was\nthe Rajah\'s daughter), and bade them take a great caldron and fill it with\ncocoanut oil, and pound down an immense number of marking nuts and throw them\ninto it, and then bring the caidron to her. They did so, and she set the whole\non fire, and caused Vicram to be hung up in a tree Overhead; and as soon as\nthe smoke from the caldron rose in the air it suffocated the Cobra in Vicram\nMaharajah\'s throat, which fell down quite dead. Then the Rajah Vicram said to\nhis wife, \'O worthy Buccoulee, what a noble woman you are! you have delivered\nme from this torment, which was more than all the wise men in my kingdom could\ndo.\'\n\nBuccoulee next caused the caldron of oil to be placed close to the hole of the\nfirst Cobra, which she had heard speaking the night before, and he was\nsuffocated.\n\nShe then ordered the people to dig him out of his hole; and in it they found a\nvast amount of treasure--gold, silver, and jewels. Then Buccoulee sent for\nroyal robes for herself and her husband, and bade him cut his hair and shave;\nand when they were all ready, she took the remainder of the treasure, and\nreturned with it to her father\'s house; and her father and mother, who had\nrepented of their harshness, gladly welcomed her back, and were both surprised\nand delighted to see all the vast treasures she had, and what a handsome\nprincely-looking man her husband was.\n\nThen one day news was brought to Vicram that a stranger Wuzeer had arrived in\nthe Palace as the Rajah\'s guest, and that this Wuzeer had for twelve years\nbeen wandering round the world in search of his master, but not having found\nhim, was returning to his own home. Vicram thought to himself; \'Can this\npossibly be Butti?\' and he ran to see.\n\nIt was indeed Butti, who cried for joy to see him, saying, \'O Vicram! Vicram!\ndo you know it is twelve years since you left us all?\'\n\nThen Vicram Maharajah told Butti how the good Princess Buccoulee had married\nhim, and succeeded in killing the Cobra, and how he was on the point of\nreturning to his own country. So they all set out together, being given many\nrich presents by Buccoulee\'s father and mother. At last after a weary journey\nthey reached home. Anar Ranee was overjoyed to see them again, for she had\nmourned her husband as dead. When Buccoulee Ranee was told who Anar Ranee was,\nand taken to see her, she felt very much frightened, for she thought, \'Perhaps\nshe will be jealous of me, and hate me.\' But with a gentle smile Anar Ranee\ncame to meet her, saying, \'Sister, I hear it is to you we owe the preservation\nof the Rajah, and that it was you who killed the Cobra; I can never be\nsufficiently grateful to you nor love you enough as long as I live.\'\n\nFrom that day Vicram Maharajah stayed in his own kingdom, ruling it wisely and\nwell, and beloved by all. He and Butti lived to a good old age, and their\naffection for each other lasted to the end of their days. So that it became a\nproverb in that country, and instead of saying, \'So-and-so love each other\nlike brothers\' (when speaking of two who were much attached), the people would\nsay, \'So-and-so love each other like the Rajah and the Wuzeer.\'\n\n![](img/17.jpg)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd11.htm#fr_41) The great King Vicram.\n\n[2](odd11.htm#fr_42) Light.\n\n[3](odd11.htm#fr_43) See Notes.\n\n[4](odd11.htm#fr_44) See Notes.\n\n[5](odd11.htm#fr_45) Four shillings.\n\n[6](odd11.htm#fr_46) The Champa Queen.
