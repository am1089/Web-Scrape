THE AGNIHOTRA OR MORNING AND EVENING LIBATIONS; AND THE AGNY-\nUPASTH\xc3\x82NA OR HOMAGE TO THE FIRES.\n\n2:2:4:11\\. Pra _g_ apati alone, indeed, existed here in the beginning. He\nconsidered, 'How may I be reproduced?'\n\np. 323\n\n[paragraph continues] He toiled and performed acts of penance. He generated\nAgni from his mouth; and because he generated him from his mouth, therefore\nAgni is a consumer of food: and, verily, he who thus knows Agni to be a\nconsumer of food, becomes himself a consumer of food.\n\n2:2:4:22\\. He thus generated him first (agre) of the gods; and therefore (he\nis called) Agni, for agni (they say) is the same as agri. He, being generated,\nwent forth as the first (purva); for of him who goes first, they say that he\ngoes at the head (agre). Such, then, is the origin and nature of that Agni.\n\n2:2:4:33\\. Pra _g_ apati then considered, 'In that Agni I have generated a\nfood-eater for myself; but, indeed, there is no other food here but myself,\nwhom, surely, he would not eat.' At that time this earth had, indeed, been\nrendered quite bald; there were neither plants nor trees. This, then, weighed\non his mind.\n\n2:2:4:44\\. Thereupon Agni turned towards him with open mouth; and he (Pra _g_\napati) being terrified, his own greatness departed from him. Now his own\ngreatness is his speech: that speech of his departed from him. He desired an\noffering in his own self, and rubbed (his hands); and because he rubbed (his\nhands), therefore both this and this (palm) are hairless. He then obtained\neither a butter-offering or a milk-offering;--but, indeed, they are both milk.\n\n2:2:4:55\\. This (offering), however, did not satisfy him, because it had hairs\nmixed with it. He poured it away (into the fire), saying, 'Drink, while\nburning (osha _m_ dhaya)!' From it plants sprang: hence their name 'plants\n(oshadhaya _h_ ).' He rubbed (his hands) a second time, and thereby obtained\nanother\n\np. 324\n\noffering, either a butter-offering or a milk-offering;--but, indeed, they are\nboth milk.\n\n2:2:4:66\\. This (offering) then satisfied him. He hesitated: 'Shall I offer it\nup? shall I not offer it up?' he thought. His own greatness said to him,\n'Offer it up!' Pra _g_ apati was aware that it was his own (sva) greatness\nthat had spoken (aha) to him; and offered it up with 'Svaha!' This is why\nofferings are made with 'Svaha!' Thereupon that burning one (viz. the sun)\nrose; and then that blowing one (viz. the wind) sprang up; whereupon, indeed,\nAgni turned away.\n\n2:2:4:77\\. And Pra _g_ apati, having performed offering, reproduced himself,\nand saved himself from Agni, Death, as he was about to devour him. And,\nverily, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, reproduces himself by\noffspring even as Pra _g_ apati reproduced himself; and saves himself from\nAgni, Death, when he is about to devour him.\n\n2:2:4:88\\. And when he dies, and when they place him on the fire, then he is\nborn (again) out of the fire, and the fire only consumes his body. Even as he\nis born from his father and mother, so is he born from the fire. But he who\noffers not the Agnihotra, verily, he does not come into life at all: therefore\nthe Agnihotra should by all means be offered.\n\n2:2:4:99\\. And as to that same birth from out of doubt,--when Pra _g_ apati\ndoubted, he, while doubting, remained steadfast on the better (side), insomuch\nthat he reproduced himself and saved himself from Agni, Death, when he was\nabout to devour him: so he also who knows that birth from out of doubt, when\nhe doubts about anything, still remains on the better (side).\n\n2:2:4:1010\\. Having offered, he rubbed (his hands). Thence\n\np. 325\n\na Vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata 1 tree sprung forth; and therefore that tree is suitable for the\nsacrifice, and proper for sacrificial vessels. Thereupon those (three) heroes\namong the gods were born, viz. Agni, that blower (Vayu), and Surya: and,\nverily, whosoever thus knows those heroes among the gods, to him a hero is\nborn.\n\n2:2:4:1111\\. They then said, 'We come after our father Pra _g_ apati: let us\nthen create what shall come after us!' Having enclosed (a piece of ground),\nthey sang praises with the gayatri stanza without the 'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85 2:' and that (with)\nwhich they enclosed was the ocean; and this earth was the praising-ground\n(astava).\n\n2:2:4:1212\\. When they had sung praises, they went out towards the east,\nsaying, 'We (will) go back thither!' The gods came upon a cow which had sprung\ninto existence. Looking up at them, she uttered the sound 'hi\xe1\xb9\x85.' The gods\nperceived that this was the 'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85' of the Saman (melodious sacrificial chant);\nfor heretofore (their song was) without the but after that it was the (real)\nSaman. And as this same sound 'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85' of the Saman was in the cow, therefore the\nlatter affords the means of subsistence; and so does he afford the means of\nsubsistence whosoever thus knows that 'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85' of the Saman in the cow.\n\n2:2:4:1313\\. They said, 'Auspicious, indeed, is what we have produced here,\nwho have produced the cow: for, truly, she is the sacrifice, and without her\nno sacrifice is performed; she is also the food, for the cow, indeed, is all\nfood.'\n\n2:2:4:1414\\. This (word 'go'), then, is a name of those\n\np. 326\n\n[paragraph continues] (cows), and so it is of the sacrifice: let him,\ntherefore, repeat 1 it, (as it were) saying, 'Good, excellent!' and, verily,\nwhosoever, knowing this, repeats it; (as it were) saying, 'Good, excellent!'\nwith him those (cows) multiply, and the sacrifice will incline to him.\n\n2:2:4:1515\\. Now, Agni coveted her: 'May I pair with her,' he thought. He\nunited with her, and his seed became that milk of hers: hence, while the cow\nis raw, that milk in her is cooked (warm); for it is Agni's seed; and\ntherefore also, whether it be in a black or in a red (cow), it is ever white,\nand shining like fire, it being Agni's seed. Hence it is warm when first\nmilked; for it is Agni's seed.\n\n2:2:4:1616\\. They (the men) said, 'Come, let us offer this up!'--'To whom of\nus shall they first offer this?' (said those gods).--'To me!' said Agni.--'To\nme!' said that blower (Vayu).--'To me!' said Surya. They did not come to an\nagreement; and not being agreed, they said, 'Let us go to our father Pra _g_\napati; and to whichever of us he says it shall be offered first, to him they\nshall first offer this.' They went to their father Pra _g_ apati, and said,\n'To whom of us shall they offer this first?'\n\n2:2:4:1717\\. He replied, 'To Agni: Agni will forthwith cause his own seed to\nbe reproduced, and so you will be reproduced.' 'Then to thee,' he said to\nSurya; 'and what of the offered (milk) he then is still possessed of, that\nshall belong to that blower\n\np. 327\n\n[paragraph continues] (Vayu)!' And, accordingly, they in the same way offer\nthis (milk) to them till this day: in the evening to Agni, and in the morning\nto Surya; and what of the offered (milk) he then is still possessed of, that,\nindeed, belongs to that blower.\n\n2:2:4:1818\\. By offering, those gods were produced in the way in which they\nwere produced, by it they gained that victory which they did gain: Agni\nconquered this world, Vayu the air, and Surya the sky. And whosoever, knowing\nthis, offers the Agnihotra, he, indeed, is produced in the same way in which\nthey were then produced, he gains that same victory which they then\ngained;--indeed, he shares the same world with them, whosoever, knowing this,\noffers the Agnihotra. Therefore the Agnihotra should certainly be performed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[325:1](sbe1247.htm#fr_741) The sruva, or dipping-spoon, and the Agnihotra\nladle, for instance, are made of this wood; see [p.\n331](sbe1248.htm#page_331), note [2](sbe1248.htm#fn_746).\n\n[325:2](sbe1247.htm#fr_742) On 'hi\xe1\xb9\x85' as an essential element in the recitation\nof Sama-chants, see I, 4, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[326:1](sbe1247.htm#fr_743) Pariharet [?

Saya _n_ a merely\nremarks, that both the cow and the sacrifice are here represented as extremely\nauspicious (utk _ri_ sh _t_ am pu _n_ yam). Perhaps we have here a play on the\nwords upanama, 'a by-name,' and upanamuka, 'inclining to (him).'
