Though not my own mother\'s child, yet the\ndear lad is brother to me; for mother is mother all the world over. With his\nguileless face, his gentle eyes, his innocent youth, he looked at me. And I, a\nwoman--of his mother\'s sex--how could I hand him poison, just because he asked\nfor it?\n\n"The money, Queen!" Sandip\'s insolent demand rang in my ears. For very shame\nand vexation I felt I wanted to fling that gold at Sandip\'s head. I could\nhardly undo the knot of my _sari_ , my fingers trembled so. At last the paper\nrolls dropped on the table.\n\nSandip\'s face grew black ... He must have thought that the rolls were of\nsilver ... What contempt was in his looks. What utter disgust at incapacity.\nIt was almost as if he could have struck me! He must have suspected that I had\ncome to parley with him, to offer to compound his claim for five thousand\nrupees with a few hundreds. There was a moment when I thought he would snatch\nup the rolls and throw them out of the window, declaring that he was no\nbeggar, but a king claiming tribute.\n\n"Is that all?" asked Amulya with such pity welling up in his voice that I\nwanted to sob out aloud. I kept my heart tightly pressed down, and merely\nnodded my head. Sandip was speechless. He neither touched the rolls, nor\nuttered a sound.\n\nMy humiliation went straight to the boy\'s heart. With a sudden, feigned\nenthusiasm he exclaimed: "It\'s plenty. It will do splendidly. You have saved\nus." With which he tore open the covering of one of the rolls.\n\nThe sovereigns shone out. And in a moment the black covering seemed to be\nlifted from Sandip\'s countenance also. His delight beamed forth from his\nfeatures. Unable to control his sudden revulsion of feeling, he sprang up from\nhis seat towards me. What he intended I know not. I flashed a lightning glance\ntowards Amulya--the colour had left the boy\'s face as at the stroke of a whip.\nThen with all my strength I thrust Sandip from me. As he reeled back his head\nstruck the edge of the marble table and he dropped on the floor. There he lay\nawhile, motionless. Exhausted with my effort, I sank back on my seat.\n\nAmulya\'s face lightened with a joyful radiance. He did not even turn towards\nSandip, but came straight up, took the dust of my feet, and then remained\nthere, sitting on the floor in front of me. O my little brother, my child!\nThis reverence of yours is the last touch of heaven left in my empty world! I\ncould contain myself no longer, and my tears flowed fast. I covered my eyes\nwith the end of my _sari_ , which I pressed to my face with both my hands, and\nsobbed and sobbed. And every time that I felt on my feet his tender touch\ntrying to comfort me my tears broke out afresh.\n\nAfter a little, when I had recovered myself and taken my hands from my face, I\nsaw Sandip back at the table, gathering up the sovereigns in his handkerchief,\nas if nothing had happened. Amulya rose to his seat, from his place near my\nfeet, his wet eyes shining.\n\nSandip coolly looked up at my face as he remarked: "It is six thousand."\n\n"What do we want with so much, Sandip Babu?" cried Amulya. "Three thousand\nfive hundred is all we need for our work."\n\n"Our wants are not for this one place only," Sandip replied. "We shall want\nall we can get."\n\n"That may be," said Amulya. "But in future I undertake to get you all you\nwant. Out of this, Sandip Babu, please return the extra two thousand five\nhundred to the Maharani."\n\nSandip glanced enquiringly at me.\n\n"No, no," I exclaimed. "I shall never touch that money again. Do with it as\nyou will."\n\n"Can man ever give as woman can?" said Sandip, looking towards Amulya.\n\n"They are goddesses!" agreed Amulya with enthusiasm.\n\n"We men can at best give of our power," continued Sandip. "But women give\nthemselves. Out of their own life they give birth, out of their own life they\ngive sustenance. Such gifts are the only true gifts." Then turning to me,\n"Queen!" said he, "if what you have given us had been only money I would not\nhave touched it. But you have given that which is more to you than life\nitself!"\n\nThere must be two different persons inside men. One of these in me can\nunderstand that Sandip is trying to delude me; the other is content to be\ndeluded. Sandip has power, but no strength of righteousness. The weapon of his\nwhich rouses up life smites it again to death. He has the unfailing quiver of\nthe gods, but the shafts in them are of the demons.\n\nSandip\'s handkerchief was not large enough to hold all the coins. "Queen," he\nasked, "can you give me another?" When I gave him mine, he reverently touched\nhis forehead with it, and then suddenly kneeling on the floor he made me an\nobeisance. "Goddess!" he said, "it was to offer my reverence that I had\napproached you, but you repulsed me, and rolled me in the dust. Be it so, I\naccept your repulse as your boon to me, I raise it to my head in salutation!"\nwith which he pointed to the place where he had been hurt.\n\nHad I then misunderstood him? Could it be that his outstretched hands had\nreally been directed towards my feet? Yet, surely, even Amulya had seen the\npassion that flamed out of his eyes, his face. But Sandip is such an adept in\nsetting music to his chant of praise that I cannot argue; I lose my power of\nseeing truth; my sight is clouded over like an opium-eater\'s eyes. And so,\nafter all, he gave me back twice as much in return for the blow I had dealt\nhim--the wound on his head ended by making me bleed at heart. When I had\nreceived Sandip\'s obeisance my theft seemed to gain a dignity, and the gold\nglittering on the table to smile away all fear of disgrace, all stings of\nconscience.\n\nLike me Amulya also was won back. His devotion to Sandip, which had suffered a\nmomentary check, blazed up anew. The flower-vase of his mind filled once more\nwith offerings for the worship of Sandip and me. His simple faith shone out of\nhis eyes with the pure light of the morning star at dawn.\n\nAfter I had offered worship and received worship my sin became radiant. And as\nAmulya looked on my face he raised his folded hands in salutation and cried\n_Bande Mataram_! I cannot expect to have this adoration surrounding me for\never; and yet this has come to be the only means of keeping alive my self-\nrespect.\n\nI can no longer enter my bedroom. The bedstead seems to thrust out a\nforbidding hand, the iron safe frowns at me. I want to get away from this\ncontinual insult to myself which is rankling within me. I want to keep running\nto Sandip to hear him sing my praises. There is just this one little altar of\nworship which has kept its head above the all-pervading depths of my\ndishonour, and so I want to cleave to it night and day; for on whichever side\nI step away from it, there is only emptiness.\n\nPraise, praise, I want unceasing praise. I cannot live if my wine-cup be left\nempty for a single moment. So, as the very price of my life, I want Sandip of\nall the world, today.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XVII](hw37.htm)\n\n'
