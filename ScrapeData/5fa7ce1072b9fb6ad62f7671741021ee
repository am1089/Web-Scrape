When Agni, having entered the waters, burned, where the (gods) who uphold\nthe order (of the universe) rendered homage (to Agni), there, they say, is thy\norigin on high: do thou feel for us, and spare us, O takman!  \n2\\. Whether thou art flame, whether thou art heat, or whether from licking\nchips (of wood) thou bast arisen, Hrudu by name art thou, O god of the yellow:\ndo thou feel for us, and spare us, O takman!  \n3\\. Whether thou art burning, whether thou art scorching, or whether thou art\nthe son of king Varuna, Hrudu by name art thou, O god of the yellow: do thou\nfeel for us, and spare us, O takman!  \n4\\. To the cold takman, and to the deliriously hot, the glowing, do I render\nhomage. To hirn that returns on the morrow, to him that returns for two\n(successive) days, to the takman that returns on the third day, homage shall\nbe!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 116.
