And it is a mere apparent argument.\n\nThe argumentation by which it is sought to prove that that being whose nature\nis constituted by absolutely uniform light, i.e. intelligence, is\ndifferentiated by limiting adjuncts which presuppose an obscuration of that\nessential nature, is a mere apparent(fallacious) one. For, as we have shown\nbefore, obscuration of the light of that which is nothing but light means\ndestruction of that light.--If we accept as the reading of the Sutra 'abha _s_\na _h_ ' (in plural) the meaning is that the various reasons set forth by the\nadherents of that doctrine are all of them fallacious. The 'and' of\n\np. 566\n\nthe Sutra is meant to point out that that doctrine, moreover, is in conflict\nwith texts such as 'thinking himself to be different from the Mover'( _S_ vet.\nUp. I, 6); 'there are two unborn ones, one a ruler, the other not a ruler' (I,\n9); 'of those two one eats the sweet fruit' (V, 6); and others. For even if\ndifference is due to upadhis which are the figment of Nescience, there is no\nescaping the conclusion that the spheres of experience must be mixed up, since\nthe theory admits that the thing itself with which all the limiting adjuncts\nconnect themselves is one only.\n\nBut this cannot be urged against the theory of the individual soul being\nBrahman in so far as determined by real limiting adjuncts; for on that view we\nmay explain the difference of spheres of experience as due to the\nbeginningless ad _ri_ sh _t_ as which are the cause of the difference of the\nlimiting adjuncts!--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 50.
