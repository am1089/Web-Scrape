If I have to\ndo something I must first know that it is my duty, and then I can do it. The\nidea of duty again is different in different nations. The Mahommedan says what\nis written in his book, the Koran, is his duty; the Hindu says what is in the\nVedas is his duty; and the Christian says what is in the Bible is his duty. We\nfind that there are varied ideas of duty, differing according to different\nstates in life, different historical periods and different nations. The term\n\'duty,\' like every other universal abstract term, is impossible clearly to\ndefine; we can only get an idea of it by knowing its practical operations and\nresults. When certain things occur before us we have all a natural or trained\nimpulse to act in a certain manner towards them; when this impulse comes, the\nmind begins to think about the situation; sometimes it thinks that it is good\nto act in a particular manner under the given conditions, at other times it\nthinks that it is wrong to act in the same manner even in the very same\ncircumstances. The ordinary idea of duty everywhere is that every good man\nfollows the dictates of his conscience. But what is it that makes an act a\nduty? If a Christian finds a piece of beef before him and does not eat it to\nsave his own life, or will not give it to save the life of another man, he is\nsure to feel that he has not done his duty. But if a Hindu dares to eat that\npiece of beef or to give it to another Hindu, he is equally sure to feel that\nhe too has not done his duty; the Hindu\'s training and education make him feel\nthat Way. In the last century there were notorious bands of robbers in India\ncalled _Thugs;_ they thought it their duty\n\np. 62\n\nto kill any man they could and take away his money the larger the number of\nmen they killed, the better they thought they were. Ordinarily if a man goes\nout into the street and shoots down another man, he is apt to feel sorry for\nit, thinking that he has done wrong. But if the very same man, as a soldier in\nhis regiment, kills not one but twenty, he is certain to feel glad and think\nthat he has done his duty remarkably well. Therefore we see that it is not the\nthing done that defines a duty. To give an objective definition of duty is\nthus entirely impossible. Yet there is duty from the subjective side. Any\naction that makes us go Godward is a good action, and is our duty; any action\nthat makes us go downward is evil, and is not our duty. From the subjective\nstandpoint we may see that certain acts have a tendency to exalt and ennoble\nus, while certain other acts have a tendency to degrade and to brutalise us.\nBut it is not possible to make out with certainty which acts have which kind\nof tendency in relation to all persons, of all sorts and conditions. There is,\nhowever, only one idea of duty which has been universally accepted by all\nmankind, of all ages and sects and countries, and that has been summed up in a\nSanskrit aphorism thus:--"Do not injure any being; not injuring any being is\nvirtue; injuring any being is sin."\n\nThe _Bhagavad-Gita_ frequently alludes to duties dependent upon birth and\nposition in life. Birth and position in life and in society largely determine\nthe mental and moral attitude of individuals towards the various activities of\nlife. It is therefore our duty to do that work which will exalt and ennoble us\nin accordance with the ideals and activities of the society in which we are\nborn. But it must be particularly remembered that the same ideals and\nactivities do not prevail in all societies and countries; our ignorance of\nthis is the main cause of much of the hatred of one nation towards another. An\nAmerican thinks that whatever an American does in\n\np. 63\n\naccordance with the custom of his country is the best thing to do, and that\nwhoever does not follow his custom must be a very wicked man. A Hindu thinks\nthat his customs are the only right ones and are the best in the world, and\nthat whosoever does not obey them must be the most wicked man living. This is\nquite a natural mistake which all of us are apt to make. But it is very\nharmful; it is the cause of half the uncharitableness found in the world. When\nI came to this country and was going through the Chicago Fair, a man from\nbehind pulled at my turban. I looked back and saw that he was a very\ngentlemanly-looking man, neatly dressed. I spoke to him and when he found that\nI knew English he became very much abashed. On another occasion in the same\nFair another man gave me a push. When I asked him the reason, he also was\nashamed and stammered out an apology saying, "Why do you dress that way!" The\nsympathies of these men were limited within the range of their own language\nand their own fashion of dress. Much of the oppression of powerful nations on\nweaker ones are caused by this prejudice. It dries up their fellow--feeling\nfor fellow-men. That very man who asked me why I did not dress as he did and\nwanted to ill-treat me because of my dress, may have been a very good man, a\ngood father and a good citizen; but the kindliness of his nature died out as\nsoon as he saw a man in a different dress. Strangers are exploited in all\ncountries, because they do not know how to defend themselves; thus they carry\nhome false impressions of the peoples they have seen. Sailors, soldiers and\ntraders behave in foreign lands in very queer ways, although they would not\ndream of doing so in their own country; perhaps this is why the Chinese call\nEuropeans and Americans "foreign devils." They could not have done this if\nthey had met the good, the kindly sides of Western life.\n\nTherefore the one point we ought to remember is\n\np. 64\n\nthat we should always try to see the duty of others through their own eyes,\nand never judge the customs of other peoples by our own standard. I am not the\nstandard of the universe. I have to accommodate myself to the world, and not\nthe world to me. So we see that environments change the nature of our duties,\nand doing the duty which is ours at any particular time is the best thing we\ncan do in this world. Let us do that duty which is ours by birth; and when we\nhave done that, let us do the duty which is ours by our position in life and\nin society. There is, however, one great danger in human nature, viz., that\nman never examines himself. He thinks he is quite as fit to be on the throne\nas the king. Even if he is, he must first show that he has done the duty of\nhis own position; and then higher duties will come to him. When we begin to\nwork earnestly in the world, nature gives us blows right and left and soon\nenables us to find out our position. No man can long occupy satisfactorily a\nposition for which he is not fit. There is no use in grumbling against\nnature\'s adjustment. He who does the lower work is not therefore a lower man.\nNo man is to be judged by the mere nature of his duties, but all should be\njudged by the manner and the spirit in which they perform them.\n\nLater on we shall find that even this idea of duty undergoes change, and that\nthe greatest work is done only when there is no selfish motive to prompt it.\nYet it is work through the sense of duty that leads us to work without any\nidea of duty; when work will become worship--nay, something higher, then will\nwork be done for its own sake. We shall find that the philosophy of duty,\nwhether it be in the form of ethics or of love, is the same as in every other\nYoga--the object being the attenuating of the lower self, so that the real\nhigher Self may shine forth; to lessen the frittering away of energies on the\nlower plane of existence, so that the soul may manifest itself on the higher\nones. This is accomplished by the\n\np. 65\n\ncontinuous denial of low desires, which duty rigorously requires. The whole\norganisation of society has thus been developed consciously or unconsciously\nin the realms of action and experience, where, by limiting selfishness, we\nopen the way to an unlimited expansion of the real nature of man.\n\nDuty is seldom sweet. It is only when love greases its wheels that it runs\nsmoothly; it is a continuous friction otherwise. How else could parents do\ntheir duties to their children, husbands to their wives and vice versa? Do we\nnot meet with cases of friction every day in our lives? Duty is sweet only\nthrough love, and love shines alone in freedom. Yet is it freedom to be a\nslave to the senses, to anger, to jealousies and a hundred other petty things\nthat must occur every day in human life? In all these little roughnesses that\nwe meet with in life, the highest expression of freedom is to forbear. Women,\nslaves to their own irritable, jealous tempers, are apt to blame their\nhusbands, and assert their own \'freedom\', as they think, not knowing that\nthereby they only prove that they are slaves. So it is with husbands who\neternally find fault with their wives.\n\nChastity is the first virtue in man or woman, and the man who, however he may\nhave strayed away, cannot be brought to the right path by a gentle and loving\nand chaste wife, is indeed very rare. The world is not yet as bad as that. We\nhear much about brutal husbands all over the "world and about the impurity of\nmen, but is it not true that there are quite as many brutal and impure women\nas men? If all women were as good and pure as their own constant assertions\nwould lead one to believe, I am perfectly satisfied that there would not be\none impure man in the world. What brutality is there which purity and chastity\ncannot conquer? A good, chaste wife, who thinks of every other man except her\nown husband as her child and has the attitude of a mother towards all men,\n\np. 66\n\nwill grow so great in the power of her purity that there cannot be a single\nman, however brutal, who will not breathe an atmosphere of holiness in her\npresence. Similarly every husband must look upon all women, except his own\nwife, in the light of his own mother or daughter or sister. That man, again,\nwho wants to be a teacher of religion must look upon every woman as his\nmother, and always behave towards her as such.\n\nThe position of the mother is the highest in the world, as it is the one place\nin which to learn and exercise the greatest unselfishness. The love of God is\nthe only love that is higher than a mother\'s love; all others are lower. It is\nthe duty of the mother to think of her children first and then of herself.\nBut, instead of that, if the parents are always thinking of themselves first,\nthe result is that the relation between parents and children becomes the same\nas that between birds and their offspring which, as soon as they are fledged,\ndo not recognise any parents. Blessed, indeed, is the man who is able to look\nupon woman as the representative of the motherhood of God. Blessed, indeed, is\nthe woman to whom man represents the fatherhood of God. Blessed are the\nchildren who look upon their parents as Divinity manifested on earth.\n\nThe only way to rise is by doing the duty next to us, and thus gathering\nstrength go on until we reach the highest state. A young Sannyasin went to a\nforest; there he meditated, worshipped and practised _Yoga_ for a long time.\nAfter years of hard work and practice, he was one day sitting under a tree,\nwhen some dry leaves fell upon his head. He looked up and saw a crow and a\ncrane fighting on the top of the tree, which made him very angry. He said,\n"What! Dare you throw these dry leaves upon my head!" As with these words he\nangrily glanced at them a flash of fire went out of his head--such was the\n_Yogin\'s_ power--and burnt the birds to ashes. He was very glad, almost\noverjoyed at this development\n\np. 67\n\nof power,--he could burn the crow and the crane by a look. After a time he had\nto go to the town to beg his bread. He went, stood at a door and\nsaid:--"Mother, give me food." A voice came from inside the house:\' \'Wait a\nlittle, my son." The young man thought:--"You wretched woman, how dare you\nmake me wait! You do not know my power yet." While he was thinking thus the\nvoice came again:--"Boy, don\'t be thinking too much of yourself. Here is\nneither crow nor crane." He was astonished; still he had to wait. At last the\nwoman came, and he fell at her feet and said:--"Mother, how did you know\nthat?" She said:--"My boy, I do not know your Yoga or your practices. I am a\ncommon everyday woman. I made you wait because my husband is ill, and I was\nnursing him. All my life I have struggled to do my duty. When I was unmarried,\nI did my duty to my parents; now that I am married, I do my duty to my\nhusband; that is all the Yoga I practise. But by doing my duty I have become\nillumined; thus I could read your thoughts and know what you had done in the\nforest. If you want to know something higher than this, go to the market of\nsuch and such a town where you will find a _Vyadha_  * who will tell you\nsomething that you will be very glad to learn." The Sannyasin thought:--"Why\nshould I go to that town and to a _Vyadha_!" But after what he had seen, his\nmind opened a little, so he went. When he came near the town he found the\nmarket, and there saw, at a distance, a big fat _Vyadha_ cutting meat with big\nknives, talking and bargaining with different people. The young man said,\n"Lord help me! Is this the man from whom I am going to learn? He is the\nincarnation of a demon, if he is anything." In the meantime this man looked up\nand said, "O Swamin, did that\n\np. 68\n\nlady send you here? Take a seat until I have done my business." The Sannyasin\nthought, "What comes to me here?" He took his seat; the man went on with his\nwork and after he had finished he took his money and said to the Sannyasin,\n"Come, sir, come to my home." On reaching home the _Vyadha_ gave him a seat,\nsaying, "Wait here," and went into the house. He then washed his old father\nand mother, fed them and did all he could to please them, after which he came\nto the Sannyasin and said, "Now, sir, you have come here to see me; what can I\ndo for you?" The Sannyasin asked him a few questions about soul and about God,\nand the _Vyadha_ gave him a lecture which forms a part of the Mahabharata,\ncalled the _Vyadha-Gita_. It contains one of the highest flights of the\n_Vedanta_. When the _Vyadha_ finished his teaching the Sannyasin felt\nastonished. He said, "Why are you in that body? With such knowledge as yours\nwhy are you in a _Vyadha\'s_ body, and doing such filthy, ugly work?" "My son,"\nreplied the _Vyadha_ , "no duty is ugly, no duty is impure. My birth placed me\nin these circumstances and environments. In my boyhood I learnt the trade; I\nam unattached, and I try to do my duty well. I try to do my duty as a\nhouseholder, and I try to do all I can to make my father and mother happy. I\nneither know your _Yoga_ , nor have I become a Sannyasin, nor did I go out of\nthe world into a forest; nevertheless, all that you have heard and seen has\ncome to me through the unattached doing of the duty which belongs to my\nposition."\n\nThere is a sage in India, a great _Yogin_ , one of the most wonderful men I\nhave ever seen in my life. He is a peculiar man, he will not teach any one; if\nyou ask him a question he will not answer. It is too much for him to take up\nthe position of a teacher, he will not do it. If you ask a question, and wait\nfor some days, in the course of conversation he will bring up the subject, and\nwonderful\n\np. 69\n\nlight will he throw on it. He told me once the secret of work, "Let the end\nand the means be joined into one." When you are doing any work, do not think\nof anything beyond. Do it as worship, as the highest worship, and devote your\nwhole life to it for the time being. Thus, in the story, the _Vyadha_ and the\nwoman did their duty with cheerfulness and whole-heartedness; and the result\nwas that they became illuminated; clearly showing that the right performance\nof the duties of any station in life, without attachment to results, leads us\nto the highest realisation of the perfection of the soul.\n\nIt is the worker who is attached to results that grumbles about the nature of\nthe duty which has fallen to his lot; to the unattached worker all duties are\nequally good, and form efficient instruments with which selfishness and\nsensuality may be killed, and the freedom of the soul secured. We are all apt\nto think too highly of ourselves. Our duties are determined by our deserts to\na much larger extent than we are willing to grant. Competition rouses envy,\nand it kills the kindliness of the heart. To the grumbler all duties are\ndistasteful; nothing will ever satisfy him, and his whole life is doomed to\nprove a failure. Let us work on, doing as we go whatever happens to be our\nduty, and being ever ready to put our shoulders to the wheel. Then surely\nshall we see the Light!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[67:*](kyog04.htm#fr_0) The lowest class of people in India who used to live\nas hunters and butchers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V.
