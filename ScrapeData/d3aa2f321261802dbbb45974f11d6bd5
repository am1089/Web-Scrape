But the Agnihotra and the like (tend) towards the same effect; scripture\nshowing this.\n\nThe reasoning as to evil deeds has been extended to the\n\np. 359\n\nnon-clinging and destruction of good deeds also. Against a notion which now\nmight present itself, viz. that this extension comprehends all good works\nalike, the Sutrakara remarks, 'But the Agnihotra and so on.'--The word 'but'\nis meant to set that notion aside. Works of permanent obligation enjoined by\nthe Veda, such as the Agnihotra, tend 'towards the same effect,' i e. have the\nsame effect as knowledge. For this is declared by texts such as the following\none, 'Brahma _n_ as seek to know him by the study of the Veda, by sacrifices,\nby gifts' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22).--But, an objection is raised, as knowledge\nand works have different effects, it is impossible that they should have one\nand the same effect!--It is observed, we reply, that sour milk and poison\nwhose ordinary effects are fever and death have for their effects satisfaction\nand a flourishing state of the body, if the sour milk is mixed with sugar and\nthe poison taken while certain mantras are recited; in the same way works if\njoined with knowledge may effect final release.--But final release is\nsomething not to be effected at all; how then can you declare it to be the\neffect of works?--Works, we reply, may subserve final release mediately. For\nin so far as furthering knowledge, work may be spoken of as an indirect cause\nof final release. For the same reason the equality of effect spoken of above\nextends only to works past (at the time when knowledge springs up). Because\nfor him who knows Brahman no future Agnihotras and the like are possible,\nsince the attainment of the Self of Brahman--which Brahman is not subject to\ninjunction--lies outside the sphere of sacred precept. In those meditations,\non the other hand, which refer to the qualified Brahman, the Self does not\ncease to be an agent, and consequently future Agnihotras and the like are not\nexcluded. Such works also--because they have no other effect if undertaken\nwithout a view to reward--may be brought into connexion with knowledge.\n\nTo what works then, it may be asked, does the statement refer made above about\nthe non-clinging and the destruction, and to what works the following\nstatement made in some _S_ akha about the application of works,' His sons\nenter upon\n\np. 360\n\nhis inheritance, his friends on his good works, his enemies upon his evil\nworks?'--To this question the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 17](sbe38278.htm)\n\n"
