He (the Adhvaryu) drives the calves away (from the cows) with a par\n_n_ a branch 1. The reason why he drives the calves away with a par _n_ a\nbranch is this. When the Gayatri flew towards Soma (the moon), a footless\narcher aiming at her while she was carrying him off, severed one of the\nfeathers (par _n_ a) either of the Gayatri or of king Soma 2; and on falling\ndown it became a par _n_ a (pala _s_ a) tree; whence its name par _n_ a. May\nthat\n\np. 184\n\nwhich then was of the Soma nature 1 be here with us now!' so he thinks, and\nfor this reason he drives away the calves with a par _n_ a branch.\n\n1:7:1:22\\. That (branch) he cuts off 2, with the formula (Va _g_. S. I, 1 a,\nb), 'For sap (I cut) thee! for pith thee!'--'for rain thee' he means to say,\nwhen he says 'for sap thee;' and when he says 'for pith thee' he means to say\n'for that food-essence which springs from the rain.'\n\n1:7:1:33\\. They then let the calves join their mothers. He thereupon touches\n(each) calf (in order to drive it away from the cow), with the formula (Va\n_g_. S. I, 1 c), 'The winds are ye!'--for, indeed, it is this wind that here\nblows 3, it is this (wind) that makes swell all the rain that falls here; it\nis it that makes those (cows) swell; and for this reason he says 'the winds\nare ye!' Some people add here the formula 4, 'Going near are ye!' but let him\nnot say this, because thereby another (an enemy) approaches (the sacrificer).\n\n1:7:1:44\\. After separating one of the mothers from her calf, he touches her,\nwith the text (Va _g_. S. I, I d), 'May the divine Savit _ri_ animate you--'\nfor Savit _ri_ , indeed, is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the gods:\n\np. 185\n\n[paragraph continues] 'may they, impelled by Savit _ri_ , prepare the\nsacrifice!' so he thinks, and for this reason he says, 'May the divine Savit\n_ri_ animate you!'\n\n1:7:1:55\\. '--To the most glorious work!' for assuredly the sacrifice is the\nmost glorious work: hence, when he says 'to the most glorious work!' he means\nto say 'to the sacrifice.'\n\n1:7:1:66\\. 'Make swell, ye invincible (or inviolable) ones, the share for\nIndra!' In like manner as then 1, taking the sacrificial food (rice), he\nannounces it to the deity, so now also he announces that (libation of milk) to\nthe deity when he says 'make swell, ye invincible ones, the share for Indra!\n\n1:7:1:77\\. 'Over you that are rich in offspring, over you that are free from\nsuffering and disease--;' in this there is nothing that is obscure; '--no\nthief, no ill-wisher may lord it!'--he thereby means to say, 'may the evil\nspirits, the Rakshas, not lord it over you!'--'May ye be numerous and constant\nto this lord of cattle!'--thereby he means to say 'may ye be numerous with\nthis sacrificer, and not abandon him.'\n\n1:7:1:88\\. He then hides the branch on the front (eastern) side either of the\n\xc3\x82havaniya or the Garhapatya house, with the formula (Va _g_. S. I, 1 e),\n'Protect the sacrificer's cattle!' he thus makes over the sacrificer's cattle\nto it for protection by means of the Brahman (sacred writ).\n\n1:7:1:99\\. On it he fastens a strainer (pavitram) 2, with\n\np. 186\n\nthe formula (Va _g_. S. I, 2 a), 'Vasu's means of purification (ventilator,\nstrainer, pavitram) art thou!' Vasu, indeed, is the sacrifice: for this reason\nhe says, 'Vasu's means of purification art thou!'\n\n1:7:1:1010\\. That night he performs the Agnihotra with rice-gruel (yavagu).\nThat milk, namely, (which he milks that night) has already been announced as\nsacrificial food to a (special) deity; hence, if he were to make the offering\nwith milk, he would offer to one deity that which has been set apart as\nsacrificial food for another deity: this is the reason why on that night he\nperforms the Agnihotra with rice-gruel. As soon as they have performed the\nAgnihotra, the pot is made ready. He (the Adhvaryu) thereupon says, 'Announce\nthat she (the cow) has been let loose to (the calf)!' When he (or she, the\nmilker 1) announces, 'She has been let loose!'--\n\n1:7:1:1111\\. He puts the pot on (the Garhapatya hearth), with the text (Va\n_g_. S. I, 2 b, c): 'Thou art the sky! thou art the earth!'--he praises and\neulogises her by thus saying, 'thou art the sky! thou art the earth!'--'Matari\n_s_ van's cauldron (gharma) art thou 2!' he thereby makes it (a means of)\nsacrifice, and puts it on just as if he were putting on the\n\np. 187\n\n[paragraph continues] (pravargya-) cauldron (gharma) 1.--'All-holding art\nthou! stand firm by the highest law! do not waver!'--thereby he steadies it,\nrenders it firm.--'May thy Lord of Sacrifice not waver!'--the Lord of\nSacrifice, doubtless, is the sacrificer, hence it is for the sacrificer that\nhe thereby prays for steadiness.\n\n1:7:1:1212\\. He then puts the strainer (on the pot). He puts it down with the\ntop turned eastwards, for the east is the region of the gods; or with the top\nturned northwards, for the north is the region of the men; means of\npurification (pavitram) assuredly is that (wind) which here blows, it sweeps\nacross these worlds: let him therefore put it down with the front northwards\n2.\n\n1:7:1:1313\\. Just as then (i.e. at the Soma-sacrifice) they clarify king Soma\nwith a strainer, in like manner he now clarifies (the milk); and since the\nstrainer wherewith on that occasion they clarify king Soma has its fringe\ndirected towards the north, therefore let him now also put it down with the\ntop northward.\n\n1:7:1:1414\\. He puts it down, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 3 a), 'Vasu's means\nof purification (pavitram) art thou!'--Vasu, indeed, is the sacrifice: for\nthis reason he says, 'Vasu's means of purification art thou! flowing in a\nhundred streams, flowing in a thousand streams!'--he praises and eulogises it\nwhen he says, 'flowing in a hundred streams, flowing in a thousand streams.'\n\np. 188\n\n1:7:1:1515\\. He now maintains silence as long as the milking of the three\n(cows) lasts, for the sacrifice, doubtless, is speech: 'May I perform the\nsacrifice undisturbed!' so he thinks.\n\n1:7:1:1616\\. When it (the milk of each of the three cows) is poured (by the\nmilker from the wooden pail through the strainer into the pot), he (the\nAdhvaryu) consecrates it by (whispering each time) the formula (Va _g_. S. I,\n3 b), 'May the divine Savit _ri_ purify thee with Vasu's means of\npurification, well cleansing and flowing in a hundred streams!' for just as\nthen (at the Soma-sacrifice) they clarify king Soma with a strainer, so he\nthereby clarifies (the milk).\n\n1:7:1:1717\\. He then says (Va _g_. S. I, 3-4), 'Which didst thou milk?' 'Such\nand such a one,' (the milker replies.) 'This one is Vi _s_ vayu (containing\nall life),' he (the Adhvaryu) says. He then 1 asks regarding the second one,\n'Which didst thou milk?' 'Such and such a one,' is the reply. 'This one is Vi\n_s_ vakarman (all-doing),' he says. He then asks regarding the third, 'Which\ndidst thou milk?' 'Such and such a one,' is the reply. 'This one is Vi _s_\nvadhayas (all-sustaining),' he says. The reason why he thus asks is that he\nthereby bestows certain energies on them. Three (cows) he milks, for three are\nthese worlds: he thereby renders them fit for these worlds. He is now at\nliberty to speak.\n\np. 189\n\n1:7:1:1818\\. After having the last (cow) milked, and having poured a drop of\nwater into the pail which he has made the milker use, and stirred it, he pours\nit to (the milk) 1, thinking 'what milk was left there, let that also be\nhere!'--(he does so) for the completeness of the sap; for when it rains here,\nthen plants spring up, and on the plants being eaten and the water drunk,\nthence is this juice produced: and therefore (the water is poured to the milk)\nfor the completeness of the sap. Having then taken it off (the fire), he\ncoagulates it 2: he thereby makes it sharp (pungent); for this reason he\ncoagulates it, after taking it off (the fire).\n\n1:7:1:1919\\. He coagulates it, with the formula (Va _g_. S. I, 4 d), 'With\nSoma I coagulate thee, the portion of Indra!' Just as on a former occasion 3,\nwhen taking sacrificial food for a deity, he announces it (to that deity), in\nlike manner he now announces it to the deity, saying, 'Thee, the portion of\nIndra!' By saying 'with Soma I coagulate thee,' he makes it palatable to the\ngods.\n\n1:7:1:2020\\. He then covers it over by a vessel 4, with the hollow part\nupwards and containing water, 'lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas, should\ntouch it from above;' for water, indeed, is a thunderbolt; hence\n\np. 190\n\nhe thus drives away from it the evil spirits, the Rakshas, with a thunderbolt:\nthis is the reason why he covers it over by a vessel with the hollow part\nupwards and containing water.\n\n1:7:1:2121\\. He covers it over, with the formula (Va _g_. S. I, 4 e), 'O Vish\n_n_ u, protect the oblation!' for Vish _n_ u, indeed, is the sacrifice; hence\nhe thereby makes over this sacrificial food to the sacrifice for protection:\nfor this reason he says, 'O Vish _n_ u, protect the oblation!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[183:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_423) Par _n_ a = pala _s_ a, Butea Frondosa.\n\n[183:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_424) Gayatryai va somasya va='both of G. and of S.,'\nSaya _n_ a. Apad asta, 'a footless shooter,' is a doubtful reading and perhaps\nan old corruption; Saya _n_ a reads apadhasta (? adhastat); cf. Weber, various\nreadings, p. 133. The Ka _n_ va MS. reads, 'devebhyas tasya aharantya\navadastabhyayatya par _n_ a _m_ pra _k_ i _kh_ eda.' According to Rig-veda IV,\n27, 3, it was the archer K _ri_ _s_ anu, who hit the falcon when it was\ncarrying off the Soma from heaven, and brought down one of its feathers. On\nthe whole myth, see A. Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers and des Gottertranks, p.\n137 seq. Cf. Taitt. S. III, 5, 7, 1; Taitt. Br. I, 1, 3, 10, 'Soma was in the\nthird heaven from here; Gayatri fetched him away; one of his feathers was cut\noff, it became a par _n_ a (pala _s_ a) tree.' Similarly Taitt. Br. I, 2, 1,\n6; see also _S_ at. Br. I, 8, 2, 10.\n\n[184:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_425) 'Somasya nyaktam,' see [p.\n167](sbe1228.htm#page_167), note [2](sbe1228.htm#fn_388).\n\n[184:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_426) This act as well as that of letting the calves\njoin the cows, of course, precedes the driving away of the calves. These\nproceedings take place on the day before the new moon, after the\nagnyanvadhana. According to Katy., the sacrificer enters on the vow of\nabstinence, after the branch has been cut. Previously to these rites, however,\nthe so-called Pi _n_ _d_ a-pit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, or oblation of obsequial pi\n_n_ _d_ as (balls, dumplings) to the deceased ancestors, has to be performed;\nfor which see II, 4, 2, 1 seq.\n\n[184:3](sbe1230.htm#fr_427) Pavate, 'blows, purifies.'\n\n[184:4](sbe1230.htm#fr_428) Thus Taitt. S. I, 1, 1, 1.\n\n[185:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_429) Viz. on the occasion of his taking from the cart\nthe rice for the oblations, see I, 1, 2, 17-19.\n\n[185:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_430) See [p. 19](sbe1204.htm#page_19), note\n[1](sbe1205.htm#fn_110). According to Karka this takes place before the hiding\nof the branch, Scholl. on Katy. IV, 2, 15. According to Katy. IV, 2, 12, 13,\nthe upavesha (see I, 2, 1, 3) is cut at this juncture--with the text,\n'Accomplishing (vesha) art thou'--from the bottom part of the pala _s_ a\nbranch on the remaining part p. 186 of which he thereupon fixes the strainer.\nWhen the sannayya oblation is not made (and consequently no pala _s_ a branch\nis used), the upavesha is made of vara _n_ a wood.\n\n[186:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_431) The milker may be anybody except a Sudra, Taitt.\nBr. III, 2, 3, 9; Katy. IV, 2, 22; \xc3\x82past. I, 12, 25.\n\n[186:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_432) Matari _s_ van's cauldron is identified in Taitt.\nBr. III, 2, 3, 2 with the atmosphere. Matari _s_ van, though sometimes\nidentified with the wind, is more generally either a name of Agni, or the name\nof a mythic personage who (Prometheus-like) is supposed to have fetched the\nfire from heaven and brought it to the Bh _ri_ gus, who communicated it to\nman. See Roth, Nir. p. 111; Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers and des Gottertranks,\np. 5 seq.\n\n[187:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_433) See I, 2, 2, 7, and note. Compare also the\ninteresting introduction to Dr. Garbe's edition and translation of \xc3\x82pastamba's\naphorisms on the Pravargya ceremony, Zeitsch. der D. Morg. Ges. XXXIV, p. 319\nseq.\n\n[187:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_434) The direction from west to east is the chief one\nin all sacrificial arrangements: hence that from south to north is the one\nthat lies across the former.\n\n[188:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_435) That is, when the milk has been poured through the\nstrainer as before. The Taittiriya school make the mystic names (or epithets)\nof the three cows Vi _s_ vayu, Vi _s_ vavya _k_ as (all-embracing), and Vi _s_\nvakarman, cf. Taitt. S. I, 1, 3; Taitt. Br. III, 2, 3, 7. In the latter\npassage these names are, as here, identified with the earth, atmosphere, and\nheavens respectively. The milker, in replying to the Adhvaryu, apparently\ncalls the cows by their ordinary names. Cf. [p. 178](sbe1229.htm#page_178),\nnote [4](sbe1229.htm#fn_412).\n\n[189:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_436) According to Taitt. S. I, 1, 3, Katy. IV, 2, 32,\n&c., he, whilst doing so, pronounces the text, 'Unite, ye that follow the\neternal law, ye waving ones (with the wave, Katy.), ye sweetest,--[filling the\nmilk with honey, Katy.],--ye delightful ones, for the obtainment of wealth!'\n\n[189:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_437) Viz. by adding to it the (sour) milk that is left\nfrom the performance of the Agnihotra.\n\n[189:3](sbe1230.htm#fr_438) See I, 1, 2, 18.\n\n[189:4](sbe1230.htm#fr_439) According to Taitt. Br. III, 2, 3, 11, it may be\neither a metal or wooden vessel, but not an earthen one (Katy. IV, 2, 34).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 7, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe1231.htm)\n\n"
