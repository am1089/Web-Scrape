[1882], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n2:3:2\n\n### SECOND BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n2:3:2:11\\. Verily, in him that exists 3, these deities reside, to wit, Indra,\nking Yama, Na _d_ a the Naishadha 4 (king), Ana _s_ nat Sa\xe1\xb9\x85gamana, and Asat Pa\n_m_ sava.\n\n2:3:2:22\\. Now Indra, in truth, is the same as the \xc3\x82havaniya; and king Yama is\nthe same as the Garhapatya; and Na _d_ a Naishadha is the same as the\nAnvaharyapa _k_ ana (Dakshi _n_ a fire); and because day by day they take that\n(fire) to the south, therefore indeed they say that day by day Na _d_ a\nNaishadha carries king Yama 5 (further) south.\n\n2:3:2:33\\. And again what fire there is in the hall (sabha), that is the same\nas Ana _s_ nat Sa\xe1\xb9\x85gamana: Ana _s_ vat (not eating) it is for the reason that\npeople\n\np. 339\n\napproach it before they eat. And that (place) where they throw the ashes they\nremove (from the fireplaces) is the same as Asat Pa _m_ sava. And whosoever\nknows this, thus gains all those worlds, traverses all those worlds, thinking,\n'In me those gods reside.'\n\n2:3:2:44\\. Now as to rendering homage to (upasthana, lit. standing near) these\n(fires). When in the evening and morning (after the Agnihotra) he stands by\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya, and sits down by it, that is the homage rendered to that\n(fire). And when, on stepping back to the Garhapatya, he either sits or lies\ndown, that is the homage rendered to that (fire). And when, in walking (out of\nthe sacrificial ground), he remembers the Anvaharyapa _k_ ana, and thus, in\nhis mind, tarries near it, that is the homage rendered to that (fire).\n\n2:3:2:55\\. And again, before taking food in the morning, having sat down for a\nmoment in the hall, he may also, if he like, walk round (the Sabhya or hall-\nfire),--and this is the homage rendered to that (fire). And when he steps near\nwhere lie the ashes removed (from the fire-places) that is the homage rendered\nto that (fire). And thus homage has been rendered to those deities of his.\n\n2:3:2:66\\. Now the Garhapatya (householder's fire) has the sacrificer for its\ndeity; and the Anvaharyapa _k_ ana (southern fire) has his foe for its deity:\nhence they should not take over that (southern fire) every day (from the\nGarhapatya); and he indeed has no enemies, for whomsoever, knowing this, they\ndo not take it over every day. Indeed, it is the Anvaharyapa _k_ ana 1.\n\np. 340\n\n2:3:2:77\\. Let them only take it over on the fast-day (of the new and full-\nmoon sacrifice), when they are about to sacrifice on this (the \xc3\x82havaniya\nfire): thus that (southern) one is taken over in order to prevent failure on\nhis (the sacrificer's) part.\n\n2:3:2:88\\. Or they may also take it over to a new dwelling; and let them then\ncook on it food (other than meat) for the priests to eat. And should he not be\nable to procure anything to cook, let him order the milk of a cow to be put\nthereon and let the priests be asked to drink it. And his enemies will indeed\nfare ill, for whomsoever, knowing this, they do so: let him, therefore,\nendeavour by all means to do so.\n\n2:3:2:99\\. Now when it is first kindled, and there is as yet nothing but\nsmoke, then indeed that(fire) is Rudra. And if anyone (Kshatriya) desires to\nconsume food (belonging to others),--even as Rudra seeks after these\ncreatures, now with distrust, now with violence, now in striking them down,--\nlet him offer then: and, assuredly, he who, knowing this, offers then (when\nthe fire has just been lighted), obtains that food.\n\n2:3:2:1010\\. And when it burns rather brightly, then indeed that (fire) is\nVaru _n_ a. And if any one desires to consume food,--even as Varu _n_ a seeks\nafter these creatures, now, as it were, seizing on them, now with violence,\nnow in striking them down,--let him offer then: and, assuredly, he who,\nknowing this, offers then, obtains that food.\n\n2:3:2:1111\\. And when it is in full blaze, and the smoke whirls upwards with\nthe utmost speed, then indeed that (fire) is Indra. And if any one wishes to\nbe like Indra in splendour and glory, let him offer then: and, assuredly, he\nwho, knowing this, offers then, obtains that food (object).\n\np. 341\n\n2:3:2:1212\\. And when the flame of the waning (fire) gets lower and lower, and\n(burns) as it were sideways, then, indeed, that (fire) is Mitra. And if any\none desires to consume food here through the kindness (maitra, of others),--as\none of whom they say, 'Truly, this Brahman is everybody's friend, he harms not\nany one,'--let him offer (the Agnihotra) then: and, assuredly, he who, knowing\nthis, offers then (when the fire gets low), obtains that food.\n\n2:3:2:1313\\. And when the coals are glowing intensely, then, indeed, that\n(fire) is the Brahman. And if anybody wishes to become endowed with holy\nlustre (brahmavar _k_ asin), let him offer then: and, assuredly, he who,\nknowing this, offers then, obtains that food (object).\n\n2:3:2:1414\\. Let him endeavour to adhere to some one of these (gods or fires)\nfor a year, whether he (the householder) himself offer (the Agnihotra) or some\none else offer for him. If, on the other hand, he offers now in this way, now\nin another, it is just as if, in digging for water or some other food, one\nwere to leave off in the midst of it. But if he offers uniformly, it is just\nas if, in digging for water or some other food, one lays it open forthwith.\n\n2:3:2:1515\\. Indeed, these offerings are, as it were, the spades for (the\ndigging up of) food; and, assuredly, whosoever, knowing this, offers the\nAgnihotra, procures food.\n\n2:3:2:1616\\. Now the first libation (purvahuti) represents the gods, and the\nsecond (uttarahuti) represents the men, and what remains in the ladle\nrepresents cattle.\n\n2:3:2:1717\\. Only a little he offers for the first libation, somewhat more for\nthe second, and still more he leaves in the ladle.\n\np. 342\n\n2:3:2:1818\\. The reason why he offers only a little for the first libation, is\nthat the gods are fewer than men; and why he offers somewhat more for the\nsecond libation, is that men are more numerous than the gods; and why he\nleaves still more in the ladle, is that cattle are more numerous than men.\nAnd, verily, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, his cattle will be\nmore numerous than those (human beings) that have to be supported by him: for\nhe, indeed, is in a prosperous condition whose cattle are more numerous than\nthose (human beings) dependent on his support.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[338:3](sbe1249.htm#fr_770) The commentator takes it, 'in whatever\n(sacrificer) exists.' The (Oxf. MS. of the) Ka _n_ va text has nothing\ncorresponding to the second and third Brahma _n_ as.\n\n[338:4](sbe1249.htm#fr_771) The printed text has Naishidha. See Weber, Ind.\nStud. I, p. 225 seq.\n\n[338:5](sbe1249.htm#fr_772) Here Yama is apparently taken as (the god of)\ndeath and destruction, caused, as Professor Weber suggests, by the warlike\nexpeditions of Na _d_ a, king of Nishadha, in the south.\n\n[339:1](sbe1249.htm#fr_773) That is, the fire on which the Anvaharya mess of\nrice, the priests' Dakshi _n_ a at the new and full-moon sacrifice, is cooked.\nSee I, 2, 3, 5; [p. 49](sbe1209.htm#page_49), note [1](sbe1209.htm#fn_173).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 3.
