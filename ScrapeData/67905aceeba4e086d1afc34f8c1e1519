O Muni! When my Father learnt the cause of my cares, he smiled and\nspoke to me in sweet words :-- \xc2\x93O Child! The Devas, the high-souled Munis, the\nwise ascetics and the Yogis subsisting on air only are not able to conquer\nthis Maya. O Narada! The power of Maya is so very great that I, Vi _sn_ u and\nS\xc2\x92ambhu, the Lord of Uma, none are able to know Her power.\n\n\n\nThat Mahamaya is creating, preserving and dissolving this world by Time,\nKarma, and Nature and other efficient causes. O Child! Know Her to be\ninconceivable and unapproachable. O Intelligent One! Do not be sorry nor\nshould you be surprised about Maya\xc2\x92s great strength, for we all are deluded by\nHer.\n\n\n\n23-25. O Dvaipayan! Thus advised by my Father, my wonder disappeared. I then\nasked permission of my Father Padma Yoni (Lotus-born) and went out on tour\nround the sacred places of pilgrimages and on my way, seeing by and by the\nchief Tirthas, I have now come here. Therefore, O Muni! Dost thou relinquish\nyour sorrows for the extinction of the Kuru\xc2\x92s family and remain here and pass\nyour time in great joy and happiness. One must bear the fruits of one\xc2\x92s Karma,\ngood or bad; knowing this fully roam at your will wherever you like.\n\n\n\n26-40. Vyasa said :-- O King! Mahar _s_ i Narada thus kindling knowledge in\nme, went away; I also thought over his words. On the banks of the river\nSarasvati, I composed this Devi Bhagavat to pass away my time during the\nexcellent period of Sarasvata Kalpa. This Pura _n_ am is excellent; it is\ncomposed on the authority of the the Vedas; all doubts are removed by it; many\nnice events are narrated here. Therefore, O King! Not the least doubt should\nbe entertained. As a magician makes the wooden dolls dance in his hands at his\nwill, so this world-enchanting Maya is making this world, moving and non-\nmoving, dance from Brahma down to the blades of grass and all human beings. O\nKing! Know Maya\xc2\x92s triple Gu _n_ as to be the cause of this mind consisting of\nfive organs of senses, that follows the Chitta (mind, buddhi and Ahamkara).\nActions arise from the causes thereof; there is no doubt in this; what doubt,\nthen, there can arise that all these creatures of different temperaments will\ncome out of the different Gu _n_ as of Maya. Peaceful, terrible and stupid\nbecome the persons in contact with the Mayic Gu _n_ as. How, then, can they\nexist, bereft of them? As the cloth cannot exist without threads, so the\nembodied beings cannot exist in the world without the triple Gu _n_ as of\nMaya. There is no doubt in this. As a pot cannot be made without clay, so\nthese bodies, Devas, human or birds, cannot be created without the Gu _n_ as.\nBrahma, Vi _sn_ u\n\n\n\np. 594\n\n\n\nand S\xc2\x92iva, too, are possessed of those three Gu _n_ as and therefore they\nbecome sometimes happy and satisfied, sometimes unhappy and dissatisfied and\nsometimes they become sad and remorseful as they are then under the influence\nof one Gu _n_ a or the other. Brahma happens at times to be full of wisdom and\nknowledge, his temper peaceful, sweet and pleasant and his soul rapt in\nSamadhi, when he becomes possessed of Sattva Gu _n_ a; again when he is void\nof Sattva and filled with Rajo Gu _n_ a, His temper becomes unpleasant and his\nappearance gets dark and awful everywhere; and when he becomes grossly\nTamasic, He becomes sorrowful and bereft entirely of intelligence.\n\n\n\n41-51. Vi _sn_ u, when resting in Sattva, becomes peaceful, sweet-tempered,\nand full of knowledge; when Rajo Gu _n_ a preponderates in Him, He becomes\nvoid of sweetness and becomes awful to all the beings. Rudra becomes, too,\npeaceful and pleasant under the Sattva Gu _n_ a, awful and void of sweetness\nunder the Rajo Gu _n_ a, and becomes sad and stupid under the Tamo Gu _n_ a. O\nKing! When Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes\xc2\x92vara and the solar and lunar Kings, the\nfourteen lords of Manvantaras, Manu and others are under the control of the\nmayic Gunas, what to speak of other ordinary mortals, men and the other Jivas.\nThe whole world is under the control of Maya; the Devas, men and all other\nbeings. None should doubt on this point. All the embodied beings labour under\nthe directions of Maya; never can they work independently. This Maya is again\nalways residing in the Highest Essence, the Samvit or the Universal Pure\nConsciousness. Thus Maya is dependent on the Highest Goddess, Who is of the\nnature of Samvit, and, stimulated by Her, resides in the hearts of all the\nJivas. Therefore one ought to meditate, worship and bow down before the\nBhagavati, the Creatrix of Maya and Who is of the nature of Samvit, Pure\nExistence, Intelligence and Bliss. Thus She becomes gracious and merciful and\nliberates the Jivas, giving them Her realisation and drawing together Her own\nMaya away from them. This whole cosmos is nothing but Maya and the\nConsciousness (Samvit) of the nature of Brahma _n_ is the Lord of Maya. For\nthis reason that Beautiful One in the triple worlds, the Devi Bhagavati is\nknown by the name Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, the Great Lady of the worlds.\n\n\n\n52-60. O King! If the Jivas can fix their hearts on that Samvit, then Maya,\nborn of the real and unreal, is quite unable to do any harm to them. No other\nDeva than the Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, of the nature of pure existence, intelligence and\nbliss is able to remove this Maya. O King! Darkness cannot destroy darkness;\nthe Sun, Moon, Lightning or Fire can destroy it. Therefore it is highly\nincumbent on us to worship the\n\n\n\np. 595\n\n\n\nLady of Maya, the Samvit, the Mother with a cheerful heart to remove the Maya\nand Her Gu _n_ as. O King! Now I have narrated to you all the events\nconcerning the killing of Vritrasura that you asked. What more do you want to\nhear now. O One devoted to vows! I have now described the first half of that\nPura _n_ a, which describes in detail the glory of S\xc2\x92ri Devi Bhagavati. This\nPura _n_ a, the secret of this Mother of the whole Universe, is not to be\ndisclosed indiscriminately to anybody. Those that are peaceful, self-\nrestrained, devoted, and possessed of Bhakti to the Devi, the disciples that\nare devoted to their Gurus and the eldest son, those are the fit recipients\nthereof. Whoever reads or hears with greatest devotion this Mahapura _n_ am,\nequivalent to the Vedas, fraught with sound proofs and the essence of all\ntalks, becomes, in this world, possessed of great wealth, becomes wise and\npasses his time in the greatest happiness. There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-first Chapter on the Sixth Book on the glory of Maya in\nthe Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n[The Sixth Book Finished.]\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 1](bk07ch01.htm)\n\n'
