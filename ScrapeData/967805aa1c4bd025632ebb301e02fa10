On account of the reversal of power.\n\nThe soul distinct from 'understanding' has to be viewed as an agent for the\nfollowing reason also. If the buddhi which is denoted by the term\n'understanding' were the agent, there would take place a reversal of power,\ni.e. the instrumental power which appertains to the buddhi would have to be\nset aside, and to be replaced by the power of an agent. But if the buddhi has\nthe power of an agent, it must be admitted that it is also the object of self-\nconsciousness\n\np. 52\n\n[paragraph continues] (ahampratyaya) 1, since we see that everywhere activity\nis preceded by self-consciousness, 'I go, I come, I eat, I drink,' &c. But if\nthe buddhi is endowed with the power of an agent and effects all things, we\nhave to assume for it another instrument by means of which it effects\neverything. For we see that agents although themselves capable of acting yet\nbecome really active only through making use of instruments.--Hence the whole\ndispute is about a name only, and there is no real difference, since in either\ncase that which is different from the instrument of action is admitted to be\nthe agent.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[52:1](sbe38039.htm#fr_33) And that would virtually identify the buddhi with\nthe _g_ iva, the individual soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 39](sbe38040.htm)\n\n"
