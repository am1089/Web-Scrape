D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n#### VII. The Soul in Sleep 1\n\n"What is the Self?"\n\n"It is the Spirit 2 made of understanding among the Breaths, the inward light\nwithin the heart, that walks abroad, abiding the same, through both worlds. 3\nHe meditates, as it were; He hovers about, as it were. Turned to sleep, He\npasses beyond this world, the shapes of death.\n\nThis Spirit at birth enters into the body, and is\n\np. 69\n\nblent with evils; at death He passes out, and leaves evils.\n\nTwo seats has this Spirit, this and the seat in the world beyond 1; and midway\nis a third, the seat of dreams. Standing in this midway seat, He looks upon\nthese two seats, this and the seat in the world beyond. Now as this is a step\ntoward the seat in the world beyond, He makes this step and beholds both evils\nand delights.\n\nWhen He sleeps, He takes matter from this all-containing world, Himself hews\nit down, Himself builds it up, and sleeps in His own brightness, His own\nlight. Here the Spirit has Self for light.\n\nTherein are no cars, no car-teams, no roads; but He creates cars, car-teams,\nroads. Therein are no joys, mirths, merriments; but He creates joys, mirths,\nmerriments. Therein are no pools, lakes, streams; but He creates pools, lakes,\nstreams. For He is the maker\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nWhen in this dreaming He has wantoned and wandered, and seen good and evil, He\nhastens back according to His entrance and His place to the bound of waking.\nHe is followed by naught of all that He has seen there; for to this Spirit\nnothing clings\xe2\x80\xa6\n\np. 70\n\nWhen in this waking He has wantoned and wandered, and seen good and evil, He\nhastens back according to His entrance and His place to the bound of dreams.\nEven as a great fish passes along both banks, on this side and on yonder side,\nso this Spirit passes along both bounds, the bound of dreaming and the bound\nof waking.\n\nBut as a falcon or an eagle, when it is wearied with flying about in yonder\nsky, folds its wings and sets itself to couch down, so this Spirit hastens\ntoward that bound wherein He sleeps desiring no desire, beholding no dream\xe2\x80\xa6\nWhatever waking terror He sees [in dreams], when men seem to smite Him or to\noppress Him, when an elephant seems to crush Him, or He seems to fall into a\nditch, this in His ignorance He deems true. But when like a god, like a king,\nHe thinks "I am this All, universal," this is the highest world for Him.\n\nThis is His shape wherein He is beyond desire, free from ill, fearless. As\nwhen a man embraced by his beloved knows naught of whatsoever is without or\nwithin, so this Spirit embraced by the Self of Intelligence knows naught of\nwhat is without or within. 1 This is His shape wherein desire is won, desire\nis of Self, desire is not, grief is gone. Herein the father is no father, the\nmother no mother, the worlds no worlds, the Gods no\n\np. 71\n\n[paragraph continues] Gods, the Vedas no Vedas; herein the thief is no thief,\nthe murderer no murderer, the Ch\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81la no Ch\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81la, the Paulkasa no Paulkasa,\n1 the beggar-monk no beggar-monk, the ascetic no ascetic. Good attaches not,\nevil attaches not; for then has He overpast all griefs of the heart.\n\nWhile He sees not, yet without seeing He sees; the sight of the seer is not to\nbe broken, for it is imperishable. But there is naught beside Him, naught\napart from Him, that He should see\xe2\x80\xa6 When He understands not, yet without\nunderstanding He understands; the understanding of the understander is not to\nbe broken, for it is imperishable. But there is naught beside Him, naught\napart from Him, that He should understand.\n\nIf there should be as it were another, one would see another, smell another,\ntaste another, speak to another, hear another, think of another, feel another,\nunderstand another.\n\nThe Seer is the Waters, 2 one with naught beside. He is the Brahma-world, O\nking." Thus did Y\xc4\x81jnavalkya teach him. "This is the highest way for Him, this\nthe highest fortune for Him,\n\np. 72\n\nthis the highest world for Him, this the highest bliss for Him; of this bliss\nother creatures live on but a morsel."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[68:1](brk35.htm#fr_25) B\xe1\xb9\x9bihad-\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87yaka Upanishad, IV. iii. 7-33.\n\n[68:2](brk35.htm#fr_26) _Purusha;_ see above p. 56.\n\n[68:3](brk35.htm#fr_27) Namely, this world in waking and dreaming, and the\nworld of Brahma in deep sleep or death.\n\n[69:1](brk35.htm#fr_28) The soul\'s seats are (1) that in this world, and (2)\nthat in the transcendental "Brahma-world," which it visits on death. The\nformer is the site of sorrows, the latter of pure joy. Between these is the\ncondition of sleep; for dreaming sleep is still in touch with waking\nexperience, and dreamless sleep is a temporary approach towards the "Brahma-\nworld."\n\n[70:1](brk35.htm#fr_29) In dreamless sleep the individual consciousness is\nmerged into universal consciousness, _pr \xc4\x81jna \xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81_ or "Self of Intelligence,"\nand thus arises absolute unconsciousness.\n\n[71:1](brk35.htm#fr_30) Two of the basest castes.\n\n[71:2](brk35.htm#fr_31) This may refer to an Indian theory according to which\nwater is essentially tasteless, but derives its special flavour from its\nsurroundings, as in a cocoanut or a lemon (see S\xc4\x81nkhya-k\xc4\x81rik\xc4\x81, xvi.); or\nperhaps it is based upon the Vedic theory that made water the first principle\nof cosmic being, as in the doctrine of Thales of Miletus.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII: Gargi and Yajnavalkya](brk36.htm)\n\n'
