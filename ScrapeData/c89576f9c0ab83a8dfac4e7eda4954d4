I have now to request you will relate to me the dynasties of\nthe kings who have ruled over the earth 1.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--I will repeat to you, Maitreya, an account of the family of Manu,\ncommencing with Brahma, and graced by a number of religious, magnanimous, and\nheroic princes. Of which it is said, "The lineage of him shall never be\nextinct, who daily calls to mind the race of\n\np. 348\n\n[paragraph continues] Manu, originating with Brahma 2." Listen therefore,\nMaitreya, to the entire series of the princes of this family, by which all sin\nshall be effaced.\n\nBefore the evolution of the mundane egg, existed Brahma, who was\nHiran\xcc\x81yagarbha, the form of that supreme Brahma which consists of Vishn\xcc\x81u as\nidentical with the Rig, Yajur, and Sama Vedas; the primeval, uncreated cause\nof all worlds. From the right thumb of Brahma was born the patriarch Daksha 3;\nhis daughter was Aditi, who was the mother of the sun. The Manu Vaivaswata was\nthe son of the celestial luminary; and his sons were Ikshwaku, Nriga,\nDhrisht\xcc\x81a, \xc5\x9aaryati, Narishyanta, Pran\xc5\x9bu, Nabhaga, Nedisht\xcc\x81a, Karusha, and\nPrishadhra 4.\n\np. 349\n\n[paragraph continues] Before their birth, the Manu being desirous of sons,\noffered a sacrifice for that purpose to Mitra and Varun\xcc\x81a; but the rite being\nderanged, through an irregularity of the ministering priest, a daughter, Ila,\nwas produced 5. Through the favour of the two divinities, however, her sex\n\np. 350\n\nwas changed, and she became a man, named Sudyumna. At a subsequent period, in\nconsequence of becoming subject to the effects of a malediction once\npronounced by \xc5\x9aiva, Sudyumna was again transformed to a woman in the vicinity\nof the hermitage of Budha, the son of the deity of the moon. Budha saw and\nespoused her, and had by her a son named Pururavas. After his birth, the\nillustrious Rishis, desirous of restoring Sudyumna to his sex, prayed to the\nmighty Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is the essence of the four Vedas, of mind, of every thing,\nand of nothing; and who is in the form of the sacrificial male; and through\nhis favour Ila once more became Sudyumna, in which character he had three\nsons, Utkala, Gaya, and Vinata 6.\n\nIn consequence of his having been formerly a female, Sudyumna was excluded\nfrom any share in his paternal dominions; but his father, at the suggestion of\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, bestowed upon him the city Pratisht\xcc\x81hana 7, and he gave it to\nPururavas.\n\np. 351\n\nOf the other sons of the Manu, Prishadhra, in consequence of the crime of\nkilling a cow, was degraded to the condition of a \xc5\x9audra 8. From Karusha\ndescended the mighty warriors termed Karushas (the sovereigns of the north 9).\nThe son of Nedisht\xcc\x81ha, named Nabhaga, became\n\np. 352\n\na Vai\xc5\x9bya 10: his son was Bhalandana 11; whose son was the celebrated Vatsapri\n12: his son was Pransu; whose son was Prajani 13; whose son was Khanitra 14;\nwhose son was the very valiant Chakshupa 15; whose son was Vin\xc5\x9ba 16; whose son\nwas Vivin\xc5\x9bati 17; whose son was Khaninetra; whose son was the powerful,\nwealthy, and valiant Karandhama 18; whose son was Avikshi (or Avikshit 19);\nwhose son was the mighty Marutta, of whom this well known verse is recited;\n"There never was beheld on earth a sacrifice equal to the sacrifice of\nMarutta: all the implements\n\np. 353\n\nand utensils were made of gold. Indra was intoxicated with the libations of\nSoma juice, and the Brahmans were enraptured with the magnificent donations\nthey received. The winds of heaven encompassed the rite as guards, and the\nassembled gods attended to behold it 20." Marutta was a Chakravartti, or\nuniversal monarch: he had a son named Narishyanta 21; his son was Dama 22; his\nson was Rajyavarddhana; his son was Sudhriti; his son was Nara; his son was\nKevala; his son was Bandhumat; his son was Vegavat; his son was Budha 23; his\nson was Trinavindu, who had a daughter named Ilavila 24. The celestial nymph\nAlambusha becoming enamoured of Trin\xcc\x81avindu, bore him a son named Vi\xc5\x9bala, by\nwhom the city Vaisali was founded 25.\n\np. 354\n\nThe son of the first king of Vai\xc5\x9bali was Hemachandra; his son was Suchandra;\nhis son was Dhumra\xc5\x9bwa; his son was Srinjaya 26; his son was Sahadeva 27; his\nson was Kri\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa; his son was Somadatta, who celebrated ten times the\nsacrifice of a horse; his son was Janamejaya; and his son was Sumati 28. These\nwere the kings of Vai\xc5\x9bali; of whom [it](errata.htm#17) is said, "By the favour\nof Trin\xcc\x81avindu all the monarchs of Vai\xc5\x9bali were long lived, magnanimous,\nequitable, and valiant."\n\n\xc5\x9aaryati, the fourth son of the Manu, had a daughter named Sukanya, who was\nmarried to the holy sage Chyavana 29: he had also a righteous son, called\n\xc3\x81nartta. The son of the latter was Revata 30, who ruled over\n\np. 355\n\nthe country called after his father \xc3\x81nartta, and dwelt at the capital\ndenominated Ku\xc5\x9basthali 31. The son of this prince was Raivata or Kakudmin, the\neldest of a hundred brethren. He had a very lovely daughter, and not finding\nany one worthy of her hand, he repaired with her to the region of Brahma to\nconsult the god where a fit bridegroom was to be met with. When he arrived,\nthe quiristers Haha, Huhu, and others, were singing before Brahma; and\nRaivata, waiting till they had finished, imagined the ages that elapsed during\ntheir performance to be but as a moment. At the end of their singing, Raivata\nprostrated himself before Brahma, and explained his errand. "Whom should you\nwish for a son-in-law?" demanded Brahma; and the king mentioned to him various\npersons with whom he could be well pleased. Nodding his head gently, and\ngraciously smiling, Brahma said to him, "Of those whom you have named the\nthird or fourth generation no longer survives, for many successions of ages\nhave passed away whilst you were listening to our songsters: now upon earth\nthe twenty-eighth great age of the present Manu is nearly finished, and the\nKali period is at hand. You must therefore bestow this virgin gem upon some\nother husband, for you are now alone, and your friends, your ministers,\nservants, wife, kinsmen, armies, and treasures, have long since been swept\naway by the hand of time." Overcome with astonishment and alarm, the Raja then\nsaid to Brahma, "Since I am thus circumstanced, do thou, lord, tell me unto\nwhom the maiden shall be given:" and the creator of the world, whose throne is\nthe lotus, thus benignantly replied to the prince, as he stood bowed and\nhumble before him: "The being of whose commencement, course, and termination,\nwe are ignorant; the unborn and omnipresent essence of all things; he whose\nreal and infinite nature and essence we do not know--is the supreme Vishn\xcc\x81u.\nHe is time, made up of moments and hours and years; whose influence is the\nsource of perpetual change. He is the universal form of all things, from birth\nto death. He is\n\np. 356\n\neternal, without name or shape. Through the favour of that imperishable being\nam I the agent of his power in creation: through his anger is Rudra the\ndestroyer of the world: and the cause of preservation, Purusha, proceeds also\nfrom him. The unborn having assumed my person creates the world; in his own\nessence he provides for its duration; in the form of Rudra he devours all\nthings; and with the body of Ananta he upholds them. Impersonated as Indra and\nthe other gods he is the guardian of mankind; and as the sun and moon he\ndisperses darkness. Taking upon himself the nature of fire he bestows warmth\nand maturity; and in the condition of the earth nourishes all beings. As one\nwith air he gives activity to existence; and as one with water he satisfies\nall wants: whilst in the state of ether, associated with universal\naggregation, he furnishes space for all objects. He is at once the creator,\nand that which is created; the preserver, and that which is preserved; the\ndestroyer, and, as one with all things, that which is destroyed; and, as the\nindestructible, he is distinct from these three vicissitudes. In him is the\nworld; he is the world; and he, the primeval self-born, is again present in\nthe world. That mighty Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is paramount over all beings, is now in a\nportion of himself upon the earth. That city Ku\xc5\x9basthali which was formerly\nyour capital, and rivalled the city of the immortals, is now known as Dwaraka\n32, and there reigns a portion of that divine being in the person of Baladeva;\nto him, who appears as a man, present her as a wife: he is a worthy bridegroom\nfor this excellent damsel, and she is a suitable bride for him."\n\nBeing thus instructed by the lotus-born divinity, Raivata returned with his\ndaughter to earth, where he found the race of men dwindled in stature, reduced\nin vigour, and enfeebled in intellect. Repairing to the city of Ku\xc5\x9basthali,\nwhich he found much altered, the wise monarch bestowed his unequalled daughter\non the wielder of the ploughshare, whose breast was as fair and radiant as\ncrystal. Beholding the damsel\n\np. 357\n\nof excessively lofty height, the chief, whose banner is a palm-tree, shortened\nher with the end of his ploughshare, and she became his wife. Balarama having\nespoused, agreeably to the ritual, Revati, the daughter of Raivata, the king\nretired to the mountain Himalaya, and ended his days in devout austerities 33.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[347:1](vp093.htm#fr_916) The complete series of the different dynasties is\nfound elsewhere only in the Vayu, the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a (which is the same), the\nMatsya, and the Bhagavata Puran\xcc\x81as. The Brahma P. and the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, the\nAgni, Linga, Kurma, and Garud\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81as have lists of various extent, but\nnone beyond the families of Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u and Krishn\xcc\x81a. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya contains an\naccount of a few of the kings of the solar dynasty alone; and the Padma, of a\npart of the solar and lunar princes only, besides accounts of individuals. In\nthe Ramayan\xcc\x81a, Mahabharata, and in the other Puran\xcc\x81as, occasional short\ngenealogies and notices of individual princes occur. In general there is a\ntolerable conformity, but this is not invariably the case, as we shall have\noccasion to observe.\n\n[348:2](vp093.htm#fr_917) In the historical passages of all the Puran\xcc\x81as in\nwhich such occur, and especially in the Vishn\xcc\x81u and Vayu, verses, apparently\nthe fragments of a more ancient narrative, are frequently cited. It may also\nbe noticed, as a peculiarity of this part of the Puran\xcc\x81a, that the narration\nis in prose.\n\n[348:3](vp093.htm#fr_918) Daksha is elsewhere said to have been one of the\nmind-born sons of Brahma, or to have been the son of the Prachetasas: see [p.\n115](vp050.htm#page_115). n. [5](vp050.htm#fn_282).\n\n[348:4](vp093.htm#fr_919) According to the nomenclature sometimes followed,\nand as we shall have reason to conclude intended in this place, there are ten\nsons of Manu. The commentator regards them, however, as but nine, considering\nNabhaga-nedisht\xcc\x81a but one name, or Nedisht\xcc\x81a the father of Nabhaga. The number\nis generally stated to be nine, although there is some variety in the names,\nparticularly in this name, which occurs Nabhagadisht\xcc\x81a, Nabhagarisht\xcc\x81ha; and\nalso separated, as Nabhaga, Nabhaga, or Nabhaga; Nedisht\xcc\x81a, Disht\xcc\x81a, and\nArisht\xcc\x81a: the latter, as in the Kurma, distinctly stated, ###. Again, ###\nBrahma P. The commentator on the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba quotes the Vedas for\nNabhagadisht\xcc\x81a: ### but the name occurs as Nabhanedisht\xcc\x81ha in the Aitareya\nBrahman\xcc\x81a of the Rigveda, where a story is told of his being excluded from all\nshare of his inheritance, on the plea of his being wholly devoted to a\nreligious life. See also As. Res. VIII. 384. The name as ordinarily written,\nNa-bhaga, \'no-share,\' has nevertheless an obvious connexion with the legend.\nThe name of Nriga is found only in our text, the Padma, and the Bhagavata: the\nVayu has Najava. Pran\xc5\x9bu is also the reading of the Vayu and Agni, but not of\nthe rest, which have Ven\xcc\x81a, Vanya, Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, Ku\xc5\x9banabha or Kavi, in its place.\nThe Mahabharata, Adi P., p. 113, has Ven\xcc\x81a, Dhrishn\xcc\x81u, Narishyanta, Nabhaga,\nIkshwaku, Karusha, \xc5\x9aaryati, Ila, Prishadhra, and Nabhagarisht\xcc\x81a. The Padma P.,\nin the Patala Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, says there were \'ten,\' and names them Ikshwaku, Nriga,\nDisht\xcc\x81a, Dhrisht\xcc\x81a, Karusha, \xc5\x9aaryati, Narishyanta, Prishadhra, Nabhaga, and\nKavi.\n\n[349:5](vp093.htm#fr_920) \'That sacrifice being wrongly offered, through the\nimproper invocations of the Hotri.\' It is also read \'frustrated.\' This is\nrather a brief and obscure allusion to what appears to be an ancient legend,\nand one that has undergone various modifications. According to the Matsya, no\nchange of sex took place in the first instance. The eldest son of Manu was Ida\nor Ila, whom his father appointed sovereign of the seven Dwipas. In his\nprogress round his dominions, Ila came to the forest of \xc5\x9aambhu or \xc5\x9aiva;\nentering into which, he was changed to a female, Ila, agreeably to a promise\nmade formerly by \xc5\x9aiva to Parvati, who had been once unseasonably broken in\nupon by some sages, that such a transformation should be inflicted on every\nmale who trespassed upon the sacred grove. After a season, the brothers of Ila\nsought for him, and finding him thus metamorphosed, applied to Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha,\ntheir father\'s priest, to know the cause. He explained it to them, and\ndirected them to worship \xc5\x9aiva and his bride. They did so, accordingly; and it\nwas announced by the deities, that, upon the performance of an A\xc5\x9bwamedha by\nIkshwaku, Ila should become a Kimpurusha, named Sudyumna, and that he should\nbe a male one month, and a female another month, alternately. The Vayu, which\nis followed by most of the other authorities, states, that upon Manu\'s\noffering their share of the sacrifice to Mitra and Varun\xcc\x81a, instead of a boy,\na girl was born: according to the Vedas. Manu desired her to follow him;\nwhence her name Ila (from ila or id\xcc\x81a, \'come\'. There, however, Manu\npropitiates Mitra and Varun\xcc\x81a, and the girl Ila is changed into the boy Ila or\nSudyumna by their favour: as the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya. Sudyumna\'s subsequent change to\na female again, is told much as in the Matsya; but his being alternately male\nand female is not mentioned in the Vayu any more than it is in our text. The\nBhagavata agrees in that respect with the Matsya, but it has evidently\nembellished the earlier part of the legend by the introduction of another\ncharacter, \xc5\x9araddha, the wife of the Manu. It is said that it was by her\ninstigation, as she was desirous of having a girl, that the ministering\nBrahmans altered the purpose of the rite, in consequence of which a girl,\ninstead of a boy, was born. The similarity of the name has induced the learned\nauthor of the Origin of Pagan Idolatry to conceive that he has found the Ila\nof the Hindus in the Il or Ilus of the Phoenicians. "The Phoenician Il is the\nmasculine Ila of the Hindus and Indo-Scythae, and Ila was a title of Manu or\nBuddha, who was preserved in the ark at the time of the deluge:" I. 156: and\nhe thence concludes that Ila must be Noah; whilst other circumstances in his\nPhoenician history identify p. 350 him with Abraham. I. 159. Again; "Ilus or\nIl is a regular Cuthic name of Buddha, which the Phoenicians, I have no doubt,\nbrought with them; for Buddha or Manu, in the character of Ina, is said to\nhave married his own daughter, who is described as the offspring of an ancient\npersonage that was preserved in an ark at the time of the deluge." I. 223. Now\nwhatever connexion there may be between the names of Ila, Il, Ilus, Ilium, Ila\n\'the earth,\' and Ilos \'slime,\' there is no very obvious resemblance between\nthe Pauran\xcc\x81ik legends of Ila and the Mosaic record; nor do the former\nauthorize the particulars of Ina stated by Mr. Faber, on the authority\nprobably of Col. Wilford. The Manu Satyavrata, who was preserved in the ark,\nis never called Ila, nor is he the father of Ila. Buddha was not so preserved,\nnor is Ila ever a title of Buddha. Budha (not Buddha), the husband of Ila,\nnever appears as her father, nor is he a Manu, nor is she the daughter of any\nancient personage preserved in an ark. There is not therefore, as far as I am\naware, any circumstance in the history of Ila or Ila which can identify either\nwith Abraham or Noah.\n\n[350:6](vp093.htm#fr_921) The Matsya calls the name of the third Harita\xc5\x9bwa;\nthe Vayu &c., Vinata\xc5\x9bwa; the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, Vinaya; and the Bhagavata, Vimala.\nAll but the last agree in stating that Utkala (Orissa) and Gaya in Behar are\nnamed after the two first. The Matsya calls the third the sovereign of the\neast, along with the Kauravas; the Vayu makes him king of the west. The\nBhagavata calls them all three rulers of the south.\n\n[350:7](vp093.htm#fr_922) The authorities agree in this location of Sudyumna.\nPratisht\xcc\x81hana was situated on the eastern side of the confluence of the Ganges\nand Jumna; the country between which rivers was the territory of the direct\nmale descendants of Vaivaswata. In the Hari Vaasa it is said that he p. 351\nreigned in Pratisht\xcc\x81hana, having killed Dhrisht\xcc\x81aka, Ambarisha, and Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a.\nM. Langlois had no doubt 79-4: in his copy, as he renders it, \'Il donna\nnaissance a trois enfans;\' though, as he observes, Hamilton had called these\nthe sons of Ikshwaku. The Brahma P. has not this passage, nor does the\ncommentator on the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba give any explanation; neither does any thing of\nthe kind occur elsewhere. We have however, subsequently in the text, Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a\nnamed as a son of Ikshwaku; and in the Padma P., Srisht\xcc\x81i Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, and in the\nUttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the [Ramayan\xcc\x81a](errata.htm#16), we have a detailed\nnarrative of Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, the son of Ikshwaku, whose country was laid waste by an\nimprecation of Bhargava, whose daughter that prince had violated. His kingdom\nbecame in consequence the Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81aka forest. The Mahabharata, Dana Dharma,\nalludes to the same story. If therefore the preferable reading of the Hari\nVan\xc5\x9ba be Suta, \'son,\' it is at variance with all other authorities. At the\nsame time it must be admitted, that the same work is singular in asserting any\ncollision between Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a and his brothers and Sudyumna, and the passage seems\nto have grown out of that careless and ignorant compilation which the Hari\nVan\xc5\x9ba so perpetually presents. It is not improbably a gratuitous perversion of\nthis passage in the Matsya; \'Ambarisha was the son of Nabhaga; and Dhrisht\xcc\x81a\nhad three sons.\'\n\n[351:8](vp093.htm#fr_923) This story has been modified apparently at different\nperiods, according to a progressive horror of the crime. Our text simply\nstates the fact. The Vayu says he was hungry, and not only killed, but ate the\ncow of his spiritual preceptor, Chyavana. In the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya he is described\nas being out a hunting, and killing the cow of the father of Babhravya,\nmistaking it for a Gavaya or Gayal. The Bhagavata, as usual, improves upon the\nstory, and says that Prishadhra was appointed by his Guru Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha to\nprotect his cattle. In the night a tiger made his way into the fold, and the\nprince in his haste, and in the dark, killed the cow upon which he had\nfastened, instead of the tiger. In all the authorities the effect is the same,\nand the imprecation of the offended sage degraded Prishadhra to the caste of a\n\xc5\x9audra. According to the Bhagavata, the prince led a life of devotion, and\nperishing in the flame of a forest, obtained final liberation. The obvious\npurport of this legend, and of some that follow, is to account for the origin\nof the different castes from one common ancestor.\n\n[351:9](vp093.htm#fr_924) The Bhagavata also places the Karushas in the north;\nbut the country of the Karushas is usually placed upon the Paripatra or\nVindhya mountains (see [p. 186](vp061.htm#page_186). n.\n[13](vp061.htm#fn_489)).\n\n[352:10](vp093.htm#fr_925) The Vayu has Nabhaga, the son of Arisht\xcc\x81a; the\nMarkan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya has, the son of Disht\xcc\x81a; the Bhagavata also calls him the son of\nDisht\xcc\x81a. According to that authority, he became a Vai\xc5\x9bya by his actions. The\nother Puran\xcc\x81as generally agree that the descendants of this person became\nVai\xc5\x9byas; but the Matsya and Vayu do not notice it. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya details a\nstory of Nabhaga\'s carrying off and marrying the daughter of a Vai\xc5\x9bya; in\nconsequence of which he was degraded, it is said, to the same caste, and\ndeprived of his share of the patrimonial sovereignty, which his son and\nsuccessor recovered. The Brahma P. and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba assert that two sons of\nNabhagarisht\xcc\x81a again became Brahmans; but the duties of royalty imply the\nKshatriya caste of his posterity; and the commentator on our text observes\nthat the son of Nabhaga was born before his father\'s degradation, and\nconsequently the race continued Kshatriya; an assertion unsupported by any\nauthority, and it must therefore appear that .a race of Vai\xc5\x9bya princes was\nrecognised by early traditions.\n\n[352:11](vp093.htm#fr_926) Bhanandana: Bhagavata.\n\n[352:12](vp093.htm#fr_927) Vatsapriti: Bhagavata. Vatsasri: Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya. The\nlatter has a story of the destruction of the Daitya Kujambha by Viduratha, the\nfather of Sunanda, the wife a of Vatsasri. The Vayu has Sahasrari.\n\n[352:13](vp093.htm#fr_928) Pramati: Bhagavata.\n\n[352:14](vp093.htm#fr_929) According to the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, the priests of the\nroyal family conspired against this prince, and were put to death by his\nministers.\n\n[352:15](vp093.htm#fr_930) Chakshusha: Bhagavata.\n\n[352:16](vp093.htm#fr_931) Vira: Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya.\n\n[352:17](vp093.htm#fr_932) Rambha precedes Vivin\xc5\x9bati: Bhagav.\n\n[352:18](vp093.htm#fr_933) Bala\xc5\x9bwa or Balaka\xc5\x9bwa or Subala\xc5\x9bwa, according to the\nMarkan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, which explains his name Karandhama to denote his creation of an\narmy, when besieged by his revolted tributaries, by breathing on his hands.\n\n[352:19](vp093.htm#fr_934) Both forms occur, as the commentator observes. The\nMarkan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya has a long story of this prince\'s carrying off the daughter of\nVi\xc5\x9bala, king of Vaidi\xc5\x9ba. Being attacked and captured by his confederated\nrivals, he was rescued by his father, but was so much mortified by his\ndisgrace, that he vowed never to marry nor reign. The princess, also becoming\nan ascetic, met with him in the woods, and they were finally espoused; but\nAvikshit kept his other vow, and relinquished his succession in favour of his\nson, who succeeded to the kingdoms of both Karandhama and Vi\xc5\x9bala,\n\n[353:20](vp093.htm#fr_935) Most of our authorities quote the same words, with\nor without addition. The Vayu adds, that the sacrifice was conducted by\nSamvartta, whom the Bhagavata terms a Yogi, the son of Angiras; and that\nVrihaspati was so jealous of the splendour of the rite, that a great quarrel\nensued between him and Samvartta. How it involved the king is not told, but\napparently in consequence, Marutta, with his kindred and friends, was taken by\nSamvartta to heaven. According to the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, Marutta was so named from\nthe paternal benediction, \'May the winds be thine,\' or \'be propitious to\nthee.\' He reigned, agreeably to that record, 85000 years.\n\n[353:21](vp093.htm#fr_936) Omitted in the Bhagavata.\n\n[353:22](vp093.htm#fr_937) A rather chivalric and curious story is told of\nDama in the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya. His bride Sumana, daughter of the king Da\xc5\x9barha, was\nrescued by him from his rivals. One of them, Bapushmat, afterwards killed\nMarutta, who had retired into the woods, after relinquishing his crown to his\nson. Dama in retaliation killed Bapushmat, and made the Pin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, or obsequial\noffering to his father, of his flesh: with the remainder he fed the Brahmans\nof Rakshasa origin: such were the kings of the solar race.\n\n[353:23](vp093.htm#fr_938) The Bhagavata has Bandhavat, Oghavat, and Bandha.\n\n[353:24](vp093.htm#fr_939) The Vayu and Bhagavata both add that she was the\nwife of Vi\xc5\x9bravas, and mother of Kuvera. In the Linga P. she is said to have\nbeen the wife of Pulastya, and mother of Vi\xc5\x9bravas. The weight of authority is\nin favour of the former statement. See [p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83). n.\n[5](vp045.htm#fn_244).\n\n[353:25](vp093.htm#fr_940) The Bhagavata names three sons, Vi\xc5\x9bala,\n\xc5\x9aunyabandhu, and Dhumaketu. Vai\xc5\x9bali is a city of considerable renown in Indian\ntradition, but its site is a subject of some uncertainty. Part of the\ndifficulty arises from confounding it with Vi\xc5\x9bala, another name of Ujayin; ###\nHemachandra. Also in the Megha Duta; \'Having arrived at Avanti, proceed to the\nillustrious city before indicated, p. 354 Vi\xc5\x9bala.\' \'To the city Ujjayini,\nnamed Vi\xc5\x9bala. Comment. Vai\xc5\x9bali however appears to be very differently\nsituated. According to the Buddhists, amongst whom it is celebrated as a chief\nseat of the labours of \xc5\x9aakhya and his first disciples, it is the same as\nPrayaga or Allahabad; but the Ramayan\xcc\x81a (I. 45) places it much lower down, on\nthe north bank of the Ganges, nearly opposite to the mouth of the Sone; and it\nwas therefore in the modern district of Saran, as Hamilton (Genealogies of the\nHindus) conjectured. In the fourth century it was known to the Chinese\ntraveller Fa-hian as Phi-she-li, on the right bank of the Gandak, not far from\nits confluence with the Ganges. Account of the Foe-kue-ki: Trans. R. As. Soc.\nno. IX. p. 128.\n\n[354:26](vp093.htm#fr_941) Dhumraksha and Samyama: Bhagavata.\n\n[354:27](vp093.htm#fr_942) The text is clear enough; but, as elsewhere noticed\n(Hindu Theatre, II. 296), the commentator on the Bhagavata interprets the\nparallel passage, very differently, or \'Kri\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa with Devaja,\' or, as some\ncopies read, Devaka or Daivata, as if there were two sons of Samyama.\n\n[354:28](vp093.htm#fr_943) The Bhagavata changes the order of these two,\nmaking Janamejaya the son of Sumati; or Pramati, Vayu. Sumati, king of\nVai\xc5\x9bali, is made cotemporary with Rama: Ramayan\xcc\x81a, I.47. 17. The dynasty of\nVai\xc5\x9bala kings is found only in our text, the Vayu, and Bhagavata. Hamilton\nplaces them from 1920 to 1240 B. C.; but the latter is incompatible with the\ndate he assigns to Rama, of 1700 B. C. The co-temporary existence of Sumati\nand Rama, however, is rather unintelligible, as, according to our lists, the\nformer is the thirty-fourth, and the latter the sixtieth, from Vaivaswata\nManu.\n\n[354:29](vp093.htm#fr_944) The circumstances of their marriage, of Chyavana\'s\nappropriating a share of offerings to the Aswini Kumaras, and of sis quarrel\nwith Indra in consequence, are old in detail in the Bhagavata and Padma\nPuran\xcc\x81as.\n\n[354:30](vp093.htm#fr_945) In most of the other Puran\xcc\x81as, Reva or Raiva. The\nLinga and Matsya insert Rochamana before him; and the Bhagavata adds to\n\xc3\x81nartta, Uttanavarhish and Bhurishen\xcc\x81a.\n\n[355:31](vp093.htm#fr_946) The Bhagavata ascribes the foundation of Ku\xc5\x9basthali\nto Revata, who built it, it is said, within the sea. The subsequent legend\nshews that it was the same, or on the same spot, as Dwaraka; and \xc3\x81nartta was\ntherefore part of Cutch or Guzerat. See [p. 190](vp061.htm#page_190). n.\n[77](vp061.htm#fn_553).\n\n[356:32](vp093.htm#fr_947) So called from its many Dwaras or gateways: ###\nVayu.\n\n[357:33](vp093.htm#fr_948) The object of this legend, which is told by most of\nthe authorities, is obviously to account for the anachronism of making\nBalarama cotemporary with Raivata; the one early in the Treta age, and the\nother at the close of the Dwapara.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II](vp094.htm)\n\n'
