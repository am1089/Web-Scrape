O Maruts, that man in whose dwelling you drink (the Soma), ye mighty\n(sons) of heaven, he indeed has the best guardians\n[1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:1:1).\n\n2\\. You who are propitiated [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:2:1) either by sacrifices\nor from the prayers of the sage, hear the call, O Maruts!\n\n3\\. Aye, the powerful man to whom you have granted a sage, he will live in a\nstable rich in cattle [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:3:1).\n\n4\\. On the altar of this strong man (here) [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:4:1) Soma\nis poured out in daily sacrifices; praise and joy are sung.\n\n5\\. To him let the mighty [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:5:1) Maruts listen, to him\nwho surpasses all men, as the flowing rain-clouds [2](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:5:2)\npass over the sun.\n\n6\\. For we, O Maruts, have sacrificed at many harvests, through the mercies\n[1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:6:1) of the swift gods (the storm-gods).\n\n7\\. May that mortal be blessed, O chasing Maruts, whose offerings you carry\noff [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:7:1).\n\n8\\. You take notice either of the sweat of him who praises you, ye men of true\nstrength, or of the desire of the suppliant [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:8:1).\n\n9\\. O ye of true strength, make this manifest with might! strike the fiend\n[1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:9:1) with your lightning!\n\n10\\. Hide the hideous darkness, destroy [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:10:1) every\ntusky [2](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:10:2) fiend. Make the light which we long for!\n\np. 155\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Gotama.\n\nVerse 1 =VS. VIII, 31; AV. XX, 1, 2; TS. IV, 2, 11, 1.\n\nVerse 2=TS. IV, 2, 11, 2.\n\nVerse 6=TS. IV, 3, 13, 5.\n\nVerse 8= SV. II, 944.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Vimahas occurs only once more as an epithet of the Maruts, V, 87, 4.\nBeing an adjective derived from mahas, strength, it means very strong. The\nstrong ones of heaven is an expression analogous to I, 64, 2. diva _h_ _ri_\nshva\xc2\xb4sa _h_ uksha _n_ a _h_ ; I, 64, 4. diva _h_ nara _h_. The Ait. Brahma _n_\na VI, 10, takes gopa, guardian, as Indra.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The construction of this verse is not clear. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-vahas has\ntwo meanings in the Veda. It is applied to the priest who carries or performs\nthe sacrifice:\n\nIII, 8, 3, and 24, 1. var _k_ a _h_ dha _h_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-vahase.\n\nGrant splendour to the sacrificer!\n\nBut it is also used of the gods who carry off the sacrifice, and in that case\nit means hardly more than worshipped or propitiated; I, 15, 11 (A _s_ vinau);\nIV, 47, 4 (Indra and Vayu); VIII, 12, 20 (Indra). In our verse it is used in\nthe latter sense, and it is properly construed with the instrumental ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ ai _h_. The difficulty is the gen. plur. matina\xc2\xb4m, instead of matibhi _h_.\nThe sense, however, seems to allow of but one construction, and we may suppose\nthat the genitive depends on the ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a in ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avahas, 'accepting\nthe worship of the prayers of the priest.' Benfey refers ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ai _h_ to\nthe preceding verse, and joins havam to viprasya matina\xc2\xb4m: 'Durch Opfer--\nOpferfordrer ihr!--oder ihr hort--Maruts--den Ruf der Lieder, die der Priester\nschuf.'\n\nThe Sa _m_ hita text lengthens the last syllable of _s_ ri _n_ uta, as\nsuggested by the metre.\n\np. 156\n\nIf the accent allowed ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avahasa _h_ to be taken as a genitive, the\ntranslation, as suggested by Ludwig, might be, Either for the sake of the\nsacrifices of the sacrificer, or because of the prayers of the sage, O Maruts,\nhear the call.'\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The genitive yasya va _g_ ina _h_ depends on vipra. Anu-taksh, like\nanu-grah, anu- _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, seems to convey the meaning of doing in behalf or\nfor the benefit of a person. Ganta might also be translated in a hostile\nsense, he will go into, he will conquer many a stable full of cows.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Ludwig has pointed out that asya may refer to the present sacrificer.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. I have altered a\xc2\xb4 bhuva _h_ into abhuva _h_ , for I do not think that\nbhuva _h_ , the second pers. sing., even if it were bhuvat, the third pers.,\ncould be joined with the relative pronoun ya _h_ in the second pada. The\nphrase vi _s_ va _h_ ya _h_ _k_ arsha _n_ i\xc2\xb4 _h_ abhi occurs more than once,\nand is never preceded by the verb bhuva _h_ or bhuvat. \xc3\x82bhuva _h_ , on the\ncontrary, is applied to the Maruts, I, 64, 6, vidatheshu abhuva _h_ ; and as\nthere can be no doubt who are the deities invoked, abhuva _h_ , the strong\nones, is as appropriate an epithet as vimahas in the first verse.\n\nNote 2. Sasrushi _h_ isha _h_ , as connected with sura, the sun, can only be\nmeant for the flowing waters, the rain-clouds, the givers of ish or vigour.\nThey are called divya\xc2\xb4 _h_ isha _h_ :\n\nVIII, 5, 21. uta na _h_ divya\xc2\xb4 _h_ isha _h_ uta sindhun varshatha _h_.\n\nYou rain down on us the heavenly waters and the rivers.\n\nWilson translates: May the Maruts, victorious over all men, hear (the praises)\nof this (their worshipper); and may (abundant) food be obtained by him who\npraises them.\n\nBenfey: Ihn, der ob allen Menschen ragt, sollen horen die Labungen, and nahn,\ndie irgend Weisen nahn.\n\nLudwig: Horen sollen von ihm, der uber allen menschen ist, die erden, seine\nbis zur sonne gelangten krafte. In his\n\np. 157\n\nnotes he would prefer: Von ihm sollen sie gegenwartig horen, von ihm der alle\nmenschen ubertrift (und die in die sonne wegegangenen), die darbringungen.\n\n_S_ roshantu does not occur again; but we find _s_ roshan, I, 68, 5; _s_\nroshama _n_ a, III, 8, 10; VII, 51, 1; VII, 7, 6.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The expression avobhi _h_ , with the help, the blessings, the mercies,\nis generally used with reference to divine assistance; (I, 117, 19; 167, 2;\n185, 10; 11; IV, 22, 7; 41, 6; V, 74, 6; VI, 47, 12; VII, 20, 1; 35, 1, &c.)\nIt seems best therefore to take _k_ arsha _n_ i as a name or epithet of the\nMaruts, although, after the invocation of the Maruts by name, this repetition\nis somewhat unusual. I should have preferred, 'with the help of our men, of\nour active and busy companions,' for _k_ arsha _n_ i is used in that sense\nalso. Only avobhi _h_ would not be in its right place then. The same applies\nto the various reading in TS. IV, 3, 13, 5, where instead of avobhi _h_ we\nfind mahobhi _h_. This too is used with reference to gods, and particularly to\nthe Maruts; see I, 165, 5, note.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Par, with ati, means to carry over (I, 97, 8; 99, I; 174, 9; III, 15,\n3; 20, 4; IV, 39, I; V, 25, 9; 73, 8; VII, 40, 4; 97, 4; VIII, 26, 5; 67, 2,\n&c.); with apa, to remove (I, 129, 5); with ni _h_ , to throw down. Hence, if\nused by itself, unless it means to overrun, as frequently, it can only have\nthe general sense of carrying, taking, accepting, or accomplishing.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Vida as second pers. plur. perf. is frequent, generally with the final\n'a' long in the Sa _m_ hita, I, 156, 3; V, 41, 13; 55, 2.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Observe the long penultimate in raksha _h_ , instead of the usual\nshort syllable. Cf. I, 12, 5, and see Kuhn, Beitrage, vol. iii, p. 456.\n\np. 158\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. See note 1 to I, 39, 3.\n\nNote 2. Atrin, which stands for attrin, is one of the many names assigned to\nthe powers of darkness and mischief. It is derived from atra, which means\ntooth or jaw, and therefore meant originally an ogre with large teeth or jaws,\na devourer. Besides atra, we also find in the Veda atra, with the accent on\nthe first syllable, and meaning what serves for eating, or food:\n\nX, 79, 2. atra _n_ i asmai pa _t_ -bhi _h_ sam bharanti.\n\nThey bring together food for him (Agni) with their feet.\n\nWith the accent on the last syllable, atra in one passage means an eater or an\nogre, like atrin:\n\nV, 32, 8. apa\xc2\xb4dam atram--m _ri_ dhra-va _k_ am.\n\nIndra killed the footless ogre, the babbler.\n\nIt means tooth or jaw:\n\nI, 129, 8. svayam sa\xc2\xb4 rishayadhyai ya\xc2\xb4 na _h_ upa-ishe atrai _h_.\n\nMay she herself go to destruction who attacks us with her teeth.\n\nIt is probably from atra in the sense of tooth (cf. \xe1\xbd\x80\xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xcf\x82 = \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xcf\x82) that\natrin is derived, meaning ogre or a devouring devil. In the later Sanskrit,\ntoo, the Asuras are represented as having large tusks, Mahabh. V, 3572, damsh\n_t_ ri _n_ o bhimavega _s_ _k_ a.\n\nThus we read I, 21, 5, that Indra and Agni destroy the Rakshas, and the poet\ncontinues:\n\napra _g_ a _h_ santu atri _n_ a _h_.\n\nMay the ogres be without offspring!\n\nIX, 86, 48. _g_ ahi vi _s_ van rakshasa _h_ indo (iti) atri _n_ a _h_.\n\nKill, O Soma, all the tusky Rakshas. Cf. IX, 104, 6; 105, 6.\n\nVI, 51, 14. _g_ ahi ni atri _n_ am pa _n_ im.\n\nKill, O Soma, the tusky Pa _n_ i.\n\nI, 94, 9. vadhai _h_ du _h_ - _s_ a _m_ san apa du _h_ -dhya\xcc\x83 _h_ _g_ ahi  \n         dure va ye anti va ke _k_ it atri _n_ a _h_.\n\nStrike with thy blows, O Agni, the evil-spoken, evil-minded (spirits), the\nogres, those who are far or who are near.\n\nSee also I, 36, 14; 20; VI, 16, 28; VII, 104, 1; 5; VIII, 12, 1; 19, 15; X,\n36, 4; 118, 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 87.
