Manu VII, 83, 84, 88; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 314.\n\n[163:2](sbe0261.htm#fr_761) According to Haradatta the king\'s body represents\nthe post (yupa), his soul the sacrificial animal, the recovered property the\nreward for the priests or fee.\n\n[163:3](sbe0261.htm#fr_762) Manu VII, 89; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 323, 324.\n\n[163:4](sbe0261.htm#fr_763) Manu VII, 115-124; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 321.\n\n[163:6](sbe0261.htm#fr_764) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. II, 271-272. A yo _g_ ana is a\ndistance of 4 kro _s_ a, kos.\n\n[163:7](sbe0261.htm#fr_765) A kro _s_ a, kos, or gau, literally \'the lowing of\na cow,\' is variously reckoned at 1\xc2\xbd-4 miles.\n\n[163:8](sbe0261.htm#fr_766) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 272. This law is, with certain\nmodifications, still in force. See Bombay Regulations, XII, 27 par.\n\n[164:9](sbe0261.htm#fr_767) According to Haradatta, who quotes Gautama in his\ncommentary, the _s_ ulka is the 1/20th part of a merchant\'s gains. On account\nof the Sutras immediately following, it is, however, more probable that the\nterm is here used as a synonym of \'kara,\' and includes all taxes. \'Lawful\'\ntaxes are, of course, those sanctioned by custom and approved of by the Sm\n_ri_ tis.\n\n[164:10](sbe0261.htm#fr_768) Manu VII, 133.\n\n[164:11](sbe0261.htm#fr_769) Haradatta thinks that the rule applies to women\nof the Anuloma, the pure castes, only.\n\n[164:14](sbe0261.htm#fr_770) \'Why does be say "intent on fulfilling the holy\nlaw?" Those shall not be free from taxes who perform austerities in order to\nmake their magic charms efficacious.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[164:18](sbe0261.htm#fr_771) The ornaments would indicate that he was bent on\nmischief. Compare above, I, 11, 32, 6.\n\n[165:19](sbe0261.htm#fr_772) \'The punishment must be proportionate to his\nproperty and the greatness of his offence. The term "with a bad purpose" is\nadded, because he who has been sent by his teacher (to such a place) should\nnot be punished.\'--Haradatta. Manu VIII, 354; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. II, 284.\n\n[165:24](sbe0261.htm#fr_773) \'I.e. a married woman to her husband or father-\nin-law an unmarried damsel to her father or to her brother.\'--Haradatta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 10, Kha _n_ _d_ a 27](sbe0262.htm)\n\n'
