The Ordeal by Poison.\n\n* 318. 318 Now I shall proclaim the excellent rule regarding the ordeal by poison: at what time, in what manner, and in what form it should be administered.\n\n* 319. 319 The exact quantity of the poison (to be given) having been fixed by persons conversant with the essence of law, it shall be weighed, and given to the defendant in the autumn season, when winter sets in.\n\n320. 320 A man acquainted with law, must not (administer this ordeal) in the afternoon, nor in the\n\np. 115\n\ntwilight, nor at noon. It must be avoided, likewise, in the autumn, summer,\nspring, and rainy seasons.\n\n* 321. 321 Spoiled poison, shaken poison, scented and mixed poison, as well as Kalaku _t_ a and Alabu poison, should be carefully avoided.\n\n* 322. Poison from the _S_ _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85ga plant, which grows in the Himalayas, of an excellent quality, having (the required) colour, flavour, and taste, and preserving its natural condition, should be given to members of the Kshatriya, Vai _s_ ya, and _S_ udra castes.\n\n* 323. 323 Let him give to the defendant one-eighth less than the twentieth part of a sixth part of a Pala of the poison, mixed with clarified butter.\n\n* 324. 324 Six Yavas should be given in the rainy season; five Yavas in the hot season; seven or eight in the winter season; in the autumn season this ordeal must not take place.\n\n* 325. 325 \xc2\x91Thou, O poison, art the son of Brahman.\n\np. 116\n\n[paragraph continues] Truth and virtue are thy support. Clear this man from\nguilt. Become (like) Ambrosia to him, through truth.\xc2\x92\n\n* 326. 326Let the man be kept in a shadowy place without taking food, for the whole remainder of the day. If he remains free from convulsions such as are generally caused by poison, he is declared innocent by Manu.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[114:318](sbe3330.htm#fr_326) 318-326. The ordeal by poison consists of the\nswallowing of a mild poison by the defendant. He is innocent if he digests the\npoison without being affected by it. Vish _n_ u XIII; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n110, 111.\n\n[114:319](sbe3330.htm#fr_327) The autumn season, _S_ arad, comprises the two\nmonths of \xc3\x82 _s_ vina and Karttika, or from middle of September to middle of\nNovember. The winter season comprises the two months of Aprahaya _n_ a and\nPausha, or from middle of November to middle of January. Mitrami _s_ ra, who\nquotes this text in the Viramitrodaya, asserts that the term 'the winter\nseason' must be taken in this place to include the dewy season, _S_ i _s_ ira,\nas well, i.e. the time from middle of January to middle of March.\n\n[114:320](sbe3330.htm#fr_328) Though the season of _S_ arad has been referred\nto in par. 319, it must be reckoned among the prohibited seasons according to\npar. 320. A. This observation seems to be just, because the performance of\nthis ordeal in the _S_ arad season is prohibited in par. 324 as well. Vasanta,\nthe spring season, extends from middle of March to middle of May. Grishma, the\nhot season, extends from middle of May to middle of July. Varsha, the season\nof the rains, extends from middle of July to middle of September.\n\n[115:321](sbe3330.htm#fr_329) Spoiled, shaken, scented, and mixed poison\nshould be avoided, because it has been changed from its natural state (into\nsomething different). Kalaku _t_ a and Alabu poison should be avoided, because\nit is too strong. A. Kalaku _t_ a is a certain deadly poison contained in a\nbulbous root or tuber. According to a well-known myth, the Kalaku _t_ a poison\nwas produced at the churning of the ocean, when it threatened to destroy the\nwhole world, and was therefore swallowed by Siva. Alabu is the bottle-gourd.\n\n[115:323](sbe3330.htm#fr_330) There are 960 Yavas to a Pala. The fraction,\ntherefore, is as follows:\xc2\x97960 \xe2\x88\x99 1/6 \xe2\x88\x99 1/20 \xe2\x88\x99 \xe2\x85\x9e = 7 Yavas. In par. 324, the\nauthor says that seven or eight Yavas of poison should be given in winter,\ni.e. in that season when this ordeal is ordinarily administered. Vish _n_ u\nlays down generally that seven Yavas of poison should be given.\n\n[115:324](sbe3330.htm#fr_331) This rule shows that the prohibition which has\nbeen levelled in par. 320 against the performance of this ordeal in the rainy\nand summer seasons, must not be interpreted too strictly.\n\n[115:325](sbe3330.htm#fr_332) This is the prayer which should be addressed to\nthe poison. A.\n\n[116:326](sbe3330.htm#fr_333) Here ends the chapter of the ordeal by poison.\nA.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 24. The Ordeal by Sacred Libation](sbe3331.htm)\n\n"
