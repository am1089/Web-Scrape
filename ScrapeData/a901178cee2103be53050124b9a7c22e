These as manifested in\nthe physical world are what we may call equilibrium, activity and inertness.\n_Tamas_ is typified as darkness or inactivity; _Rajas_ is activity, expressed\nas attraction or repulsion; and _Sattva_ is the equilibrium of the two.\n\nIn every man there are these three forces. Sometimes _Tamas_ prevails; we\nbecome lazy; we cannot move; we are inactive, bound down by certain ideas or\nby mere dullness. At other times activity prevails and at still other times\nthat calm balancing of both. Again, in different men, one of these forces is\ngenerally predominant. The characteristic of one man is inactivity, dullness\nand laziness; that of another, activity, power, manifestation of energy; and\nin still another we find the sweetness, calmness and gentleness, which are due\nto the balancing of both action and inaction. So in all creation--in animals,\nplants and men--we find the more or less typical manifestation of all these\ndifferent forces.\n\n_Karma-Yoga_ has specially to deal with these three factors. By teaching what\nthey are and how to employ them it helps us to do our work better. Human\nsociety is a graded organisation. We all know about morality, and we all know\nabout duty, but at the same time we find that in different countries the\nsignificance of morality varies greatly. What is regarded as moral in one\ncountry, may in another be considered perfectly immoral. For instance, in one\ncountry cousins may marry; in another, it is thought to be very immoral; in\none, men may marry\n\np. 35\n\ntheir sisters-in-law; in another, it is regarded as immoral; in one country\npeople may marry only once; in another, many times; and so forth. Similarly in\nall other departments of morality we find the standard varies greatly; yet we\nhave the idea that there must be a universal standard of morality.\n\nSo it is with duty. The idea of duty varies much among different nations: in\none country, if a man does not do certain things, people will say he has acted\nwrongly; while if he does those very things in another country, people will\nsay that he did not act rightly; and yet we know that there must be some\nuniversal idea of duty. In the same way, one class of society thinks that\ncertain things are among its duty, while another class thinks quite the\nopposite and would be horrified if it had to do those things. Two ways are\nleft open to us,--the way of the ignorant, who think that there is only one\nway to truth and that all the rest are wrong,--and the way of the wise, who\nadmit that, according to our mental constitution or the different planes of\nexistence in which we are, duty and morality may vary. The important thing is\nto know that there are gradations of duty and of morality--that the duty of\none state of life, in one set of circumstances will not and cannot be that of\nanother.\n\nTo illustrate:--All great teachers have taught, "Resist not evil," that non-\nresistance is the highest moral ideal. We all know that, if a certain number\nof us attempted to put that maxim fully into practice, the whole social fabric\nwould fall to pieces, the wicked would take possession of our properties and\nour lives, and would do whatever they liked with us. Even if only one day of\nsuch non-resistance were practised it would lead to disaster. Yet,\nintuitively, in our heart of hearts we feel the truth of the teaching, "Resist\nnot evil." This seems to us to be the highest ideal; yet to teach this\ndoctrine only would be equivalent to condemning a vast portion of mankind. Not\nonly so,\n\np. 36\n\nit would be making men feel that they were always doing wrong, cause in them\nscruples of conscience in all their actions; it would weaken them, and that\nconstant self-disapproval would breed more vice than any other weakness would.\nTo the man who has begun to hate himself the gate to degeneration has already\nopened; and the same is true of a nation.\n\nOur first duty is not to hate ourselves; because to advance we must have faith\nin ourselves first and then in God. He who has no faith in himself can never\nhave faith in God. Therefore, the only alternative remaining to us is to\nrecognise that duty and morality vary under different circumstances; not that\nthe man who resists evil is doing what is always and in itself wrong, but that\nin the different circumstances in which he is placed it may become even his\nduty to resist evil.\n\nIn reading the _Bhagavad-Gita_ , many of you in Western countries may have\nfelt astonished at the second chapter, wherein Sri Krishna calls Arjuna a\nhypocrite and a coward because of his refusal to fight, or offer resistance,\non account of his adversaries being his friends and relatives, making the plea\nthat non-resistance was the highest ideal of love. This is a great lesson for\nus all to learn, that in all matters the two extremes are alike; the extreme\npositive and the extreme negative are always similar; when the vibrations of\nlight are too slow we do not see them, nor do we see them when they are too\nrapid. So with sound; when very low in pitch we do not hear it, when very high\nwe do not hear it either. Of like nature is the difference between resistance\nand non-resistance. One man does not resist because he is weak, lazy, and\ncannot because he will not; the other man knows that he can strike an\nirresistible blow if he likes; yet he not only does not strike, but blesses\nhis enemies. The one who from weakness resists not commits a sin, and as such\ncannot receive any benefit from the non-resistance; while the\n\np. 37\n\nother would commit a sin by offering resistance. Buddha gave up his throne and\nrenounced his position, that was true renunciation; but there cannot be any\nquestion of renunciation in the case of a beggar who has nothing to renounce.\nSo we must always be careful about what we really mean when we speak of this\nnon-resistance and ideal love. We must first take care to understand whether\nwe have the power of resistance or not. Then, having the power, if we renounce\nit and do not resist, we are doing a grand act of love; but if we cannot\nresist, and yet, at the same time, try to deceive ourselves into the belief\nthat we are actuated by motives of the highest love, we are doing the exact\nopposite. Arjuna became a coward at the sight of the mighty array against him;\nhis "love" made him forget his duty towards his country and king. That is why\nSri Krishna told him that he was a hypocrite:--Thou talkest like a wise man,\nbut thy actions betray thee to be a coward; therefore stand up and fight!\n\nSuch is the central idea of _Karma-Yoga_. The _Karma-Yogin_ is the man who\nunderstands that the highest ideal is non-resistance, and who also knows that\nthis nonresistance is the highest manifestation of power in actual possession,\nalso what is called the resisting of evil is but a step on the way towards the\nmanifestation of this highest power, namely, non-resistance. Before reaching\nthis highest ideal, man\'s duty is to resist evil; let him work, let him fight,\nlet him strike straight from the shoulder. Then only, when he has gained the\npower to resist, will non-resistance be a virtue.\n\nI once met a man in my country whom I had known before as a very stupid, dull\nperson, who knew nothing and had not the desire to know anything, and was\nliving the life of a brute. He asked me what he should do to know God, how he\nwas to get free. "Can you tell a lie?" I asked him. "No," he replied. "Then\nyou must learn to do so. It is better to tell a lie than to be a brute, or\n\np. 38\n\na log of wood; you are inactive; you have not certainly reached the highest\nstate, which is beyond all actions, calm and serene; you are too dull even to\ndo something wicked." That was an extreme case, of course, and I was joking\nwith him; but what I meant was, that a man must be active, in order to pass\nthrough activity to perfect calmness.\n\nInactivity should be avoided by all means. Activity always means resistance.\nResist all evils, mental and physical; and when you have succeeded in\nresisting, then will calmness come. It is very easy to say, "Hate nobody,\nresist not evil," but We know what that kind generally means in practice. When\nthe eyes of society are turned towards us we may make a show of non-\nresistance, but in our hearts it is canker all the time. We feel the utter\nwant of the calm of non-resistance; we feel that it would be better for us to\nresist. If you desire wealth, and know at the same time that the whole world\nregards him who aims at wealth as a very wicked man, you, perhaps, will not\ndare to plunge into the struggle for wealth, yet your mind will be running day\nand night after money. This is hypocrisy and will serve no purpose. Plunge\ninto the world, and then, after a time, when you have suffered and enjoyed all\nthat is in it, will renunciation come; then will calmness come. So fulfil your\ndesire for power and everything else, and after you have fulfilled the desire,\nwill come the time when you will know that they are all very little things;\nbut until you have fulfilled this desire, until you have passed through that\nactivity, it is impossible for you to come to the state of calmness, serenity\nand self-surrender. These ideas of serenity and renunciation have been\npreached for thousands of years; everybody has heard of them from childhood,\nand yet we see very few in the world who have really reached that stage. I do\nnot know if I have seen twenty persons in my life who are\n\np. 39\n\nreally calm and non-resisting, and I have travelled over half the world.\n\nEvery man should take up his own ideal and endeavour to accomplish it; that is\na surer way of progress than taking up other men\'s ideals, which he can never\nhope to accomplish. For instance, we take a child and at once give him the\ntask of walking twenty miles; either the little one dies, or one in a thousand\ncrawls the twenty miles, to reach the end exhausted and half-dead. That is\nlike what we generally try to do with the world. All the men and women, in any\nsociety, are not of the same mind, capacity, or of the same power to do\nthings; they must have different ideals, and we have no right to sneer at any\nideal. Let every one do the best he can for realising his own ideal Nor is it\nright that I should be judged by your standard or you by mine. The apple tree\nshould not be judged by the standard of the oak, nor the oak by that of the\napple. To judge the apple tree you must take the apple standard; and for the\noak its own standard.\n\nUnity in variety is the plan of creation. However men and women may vary\nindividually, there is unity in the background. The different individual\ncharacters and classes of men and women are natural variations in creation.\nHence, we ought not to judge them by the same standard or put the same ideal\nbefore them. Such a course creates an unnatural struggle only and the result\nis that man begins to hate himself and is hindered from becoming religious and\ngood. Our duty is to encourage every one in his struggle to live up to his own\nhighest ideal, and strive at the same time to make the ideal as near as\npossible to the truth.\n\nIn the Hindu system of morality we find that this fact has been recognised\nfrom very ancient times; and in their scriptures and books on ethics different\nrules are laid down for the different classes of men,--the householder,\n\np. 40\n\nthe _Sanny asin_ (the man who has renounced the world), and the student.\n\nThe life of every individual, according to the Hindu scriptures, has its\npeculiar duties apart from what belongs in common to universal humanity. The\nHindu begins life as a student; then he marries and becomes a householder; in\nold age he retires, and lastly he gives up the world and becomes a _Sanny\nasin_. To each of these stages of life certain duties are attached. No one of\nthese stages is intrinsically superior to another; the life of the married man\nis quite as great as that of the celibate who has devoted himself to religious\nwork. The scavenger in the street is quite as great and glorious as the king\non his throne. Take him off his throne, make him do the work of the scavenger,\nand see how he fares. Take up the scavenger and see how he will rule. It is\nuseless to say that the man who lives out of the world is a greater man than\nhe who lives in the world; it is much more difficult to live in the world and\nworship God than to give it up and live a free and easy life. The four stages\nof life in India have in later times been reduced to two,--that of the\nhouseholder and of the monk. The householder marries and carries on his duties\nas a citizen, and the duty of the other is to devote his energies wholly to\nreligion, to preach and to worship God. I shall read to you a few passages\nfrom the _Mah a-Nirvana-Tantra_, which treats of this subject and you will see\nthat it is a very difficult task for a man to be a householder, and perform\nall his duties perfectly:--\n\nThe householder should be devoted to God; the knowledge of God should be his\ngoal of life. Yet he must work constantly, perform all his duties; he must\ngive up the fruits of his actions to God.\n\nIt is the most difficult thing in this world, to work and not care for the\nresult, to help a man and never think that he ought to be grateful, to do some\ngood work and at the same time never look to see whether it brings you name\n\np. 41\n\nor fame, or nothing at all. Even the most arrant coward becomes brave when the\nworld praises him. A fool can do heroic deeds when the approbation of society\nis upon him, but for a man to constantly do good without caring for the\napprobation of his fellow-men is indeed the highest sacrifice man can perform.\nThe great duty of the householder is to earn a living, but he must take care\nthat he does not do it by telling lies, or by cheating, or by robbing others;\nand he must remember that his life is for the service of God, and the poor.\n\nKnowing that mother and father are the visible representatives of God, the\nhouseholder, always and by all means, must please them. If the mother is\npleased, and the father, God is pleased with that man. That child is really a\ngood child who never speaks harsh words to his parents.\n\nBefore parents one must not utter jokes, must not show restlessness, must not\nshow anger or temper. Before mother or father, a child must bow down low, and\nstand up in their presence, and must not take a seat until they order him to\nsit.\n\nIf the householder has food and drink and clothes without first seeing that\nhis mother and his father, his children, his wife, and the poor, are supplied,\nhe is committing a sin. The mother and the father are the causes of this body,\nso a man must undergo a thousand troubles in order to do good to them.\n\nEven so is his duty to his wife; no man should scold his wife, and he must\nalways maintain her as if she were his own mother. And even when he is in the\ngreatest difficulties and troubles, he must not show anger to his wife.\n\nHe who thinks of another woman besides his wife, if he touches her even with\nhis mind--that man goes to dark hell.\n\nBefore women he must not talk improper language,\n\np. 42\n\nand never brag of his powers. He must not say, \'I have-done this, and I have\ndone that.\'\n\nThe householder must always please his wife with money, clothes, love, faith,\nand words like nectar, and never do anything to disturb her. That man who has.\nsucceeded in getting the love of a chaste wife has succeded in his religion\nand has all the virtues.\n\nThe following are duties towards children:--\n\nA son should be lovingly reared up to his fourth year he should be educated\ntill he is sixteen. When he is twenty years of age he should be employed in\nsome work; he should then be treated affectionately by his father as his\nequal. Exactly in the same manner the daughter should be brought up, and\nshould be educated with the greatest care. And when she marries, the father\nought to give her jewels and wealth.\n\nThen the duty of the man is towards his brothers and sisters, and towards the\nchildren of his brothers and sisters, if they are poor, and towards his other\nrelatives, his friends and his servants. Then his duties are towards the\npeople of the same village, and the poor, and any one that comes to him for\nhelp. Having sufficient means, if the householder does not take care to give\nto his relatives and to the poor, know him to be only a brute; he is not a\nhuman being.\n\nExcessive attachment to food, clothes, and the tending of the body, and\ndressing of the hair should be avoided. The householder must be pure in heart\nand clean in body,. always active and always ready for work.\n\nTo his enemies the householder must be a hero. Then he must resist. That is\nthe duty of the householder. He must not sit down in a corner and weep, and\ntalk non- sense about non-resistance. If he does not show himself a hero to\nhis enemies he has not done his duty. And to his friends and relatives he must\nbe as gentle as a lamb.\n\nIt is the duty of the householder not to pay reverence\n\np. 43\n\nto the wicked; because, if he reverences the wicked people of the world, he\npatronises wickedness; and it will be a great mistake if he disregards those\nwho are worthy of respect, the good people. He must not be gushing in his\nfriendship; he must not go out of the way making friends everywhere; he must\nwatch the actions of the men he wants to make friends with, and their dealings\nwith other men, reason upon them, and then make friends.\n\nThese three things he must not talk of. He must not talk in public of his own\nfame; he must not preach his own name or his own powers; he must not talk of\nhis wealth, or of anything that has been told to him privately.\n\nA man must not say he is poor, or that he is wealthy--he must not brag of his\nwealth. Let him keep his own counsel; this is his religious duty. This is not\nmere worldly wisdom; if a man does not do so, he may be held to be immoral.\n\nThe householder is the basis, the prop, of the whole society; he is the\nprincipal earner. The poor, the weak, the children and the women who do not\nwork--all live upon the householder; so there must be certain duties that he\nhas to perform, and these duties must make him feel strong to perform them,\nand not make him think that he is doing things beneath his ideal. Therefore,\nif he has done something weak, or has made some mistake, he must not say so in\npublic; and if he is engaged in some enterprise and knows he is sure to fail\nin it he must not speak of it. Such self-exposure is not only uncalled-for,\nbut also unnerves the man and makes him unfit for the performance of his\nlegitimate duties in life. At the same time, he must struggle hard to acquire\nthese things--firstly, knowledge, and secondly, wealth. It is his duty, and if\nhe does not do his duty he is nobody. A householder who does not struggle to\nget wealth is immoral. If he is lazy, and content to lead an idle life, he is\nimmoral,\n\np. 44\n\nbecause upon him depend hundreds. If he gets riches hundreds of others will be\nthereby supported.\n\nIf there were not in this city hundreds who had striven to become rich, and\nwho had acquired wealth, where would all this civilisation, and these\nalmshouses and great houses be?\n\nGoing after wealth in such a case is not bad, because that wealth is for\ndistribution. The householder is the centre of life and society. It is a\nworship for him to acquire and spend wealth nobly, for the householder who\nstruggles to become rich by good means and for good purposes is doing\npractically the same thing for the attainment of salvation as the anchorite\ndoes in his cell when he is praying, for in them we see only the different\naspects of the same virtue of self-surrender and self-sacrifice prompted by\nthe feeling of devotion to God and to all that is His.\n\nHe must struggle to acquire a good name by all means; he must not gamble; he\nmust not move in the company of the wicked; he must not tell lies, and must\nnot be the cause of trouble to others.\n\nOften people enter into things they have not the means to accomplish, with the\nresult that they cheat others to attain their own ends. Then there is in all\nthings the time factor to be taken into consideration; what at one time might\nbe a failure, would perhaps at another time be a very great success.\n\nThe householder must speak the truth, and speak gently, using words which\npeople like, which will do good to others; nor should he talk of the business\nof other men.\n\nThe householder by digging tanks, by planting trees on the roadsides, by\nestablishing rest-houses for men and animals, by making roads and building\nbridges, goes towards the same goal as the greatest Yogin.\n\nThis is one part of the doctrine of _Karma-Yoga_ --activity, the duty of the\nhouseholder. There is a passage later on, where it says that "if the\nhouseholder dies in\n\np. 45\n\nbattle, fighting for his country or his religion, he comes to the same goal as\nthe Yogin by meditation," showing thereby that what is duty for one is not\nduty for another; at the same time, it does not say that this duty is lowering\nand the other elevating; each duty has its own place, and according to the\ncircumstances in which we are placed, must we perform our duties.\n\nOne idea comes out of all this, the condemnation of all weakness. This is a\nparticular idea in all our teachings which I like, either in philosophy, or in\nreligion, or in work. If you read the Vedas you will find this word always\nrepeated--"fearlessness"--fear nothing. Fear is a sign of weakness. A man must\ngo about his duties without taking notice of the sneers and the ridicule of\nthe world.\n\nIf a man retires from the world to worship God, he must not think that those\nwho live in the world and work for the good of the world are not worshipping\nGod; neither must those who live in the world, for wife and children, think\nthat those who give up the world are low vagabonds. Each is great in his own\nplace. This thought I will illustrate by a story.\n\nA certain king used to inquire of all the _Sannyasins_ that came to his\ncountry, "Which is the greater man--he who gives up the world and becomes a\n_Sannyasin_ , or he who lives in the world and performs his duties as a\nhouseholder?" Many wise men sought to solve the problem. Some asserted that\nthe _Sannyasin_ was the greater, upon which the king demanded that they should\nprove their assertion. When they could not, he ordered them to marry and\nbecome householders. Then others came and said, "The householder who performs\nhis duties is the greater man." Of them, too, the king demanded proofs. When\nthey could not give them, he made them also settle down as householders.\n\nAt last there came a young _Sannyasin_ , and the king\n\np. 46\n\nsimilarly inquired of him also. He answered, "Each, O king, is equally great\nin his place." "Prove this to me," asked the king. "I will prove it to you,"\nsaid the Sannyasin, "but you must first come and live as I do for a few days,\nthat I may be able to prove to you what I say." The king consented and\nfollowed the _Sannyasin_ out of his own territory and passed through many\nother countries until they came to a great kingdom. In the capital of that\nkingdom a great ceremony was going on. The king and the Sannyasin heard the\nnoise of drums and music, and heard also the criers; the people were assembled\nin the streets in gala dress, and a great proclamation was being made. The\nking and the _Sannyasin_ stood there to see what was going on. The crier was\nproclaiming loudly that the princess, daughter of the king of that country,\nwas about to choose a husband from among those assembled before her.\n\nIt was an old custom in India for princesses to choose husbands in this way,\neach princess had certain ideas of the sort of man she wanted for a husband;\nsome would have the handsomest man; others would have only the most learned;\nothers again the richest, and so on. All the princes of the neighbourhood put\non their bravest attire and presented themselves before her. Sometimes they\ntoo had their own criers to enumerate their advantages and the reasons why\nthey hoped the princess would choose them. The princess was taken round on a\nthrone, in the most [splendid](errata.htm#1) array and looked at and heard\nabout them. If she was not pleased with what she saw and heard, she said to\nher bearers, "Move on," and no more notice was taken of the rejected suitors.\nIf, however, the princess was pleased with any one of them she threw a garland\nof flowers over him and he became her husband.\n\nThe princess of the country to which our king and the _Sannyasin_ had come was\nhaving one of these interesting ceremonies. She was the most beautiful\nprincess\n\np. 47\n\nin the world, and the husband of the princess would be ruler of the kingdom\nafter her father\'s death. The idea of this princess was to marry the\nhandsomest man, but she could not find the right one to please her. Several\ntimes these meetings had taken place, but the princess could not select a\nhusband. This meeting was the most splendid of all; more people than ever had\ncome to it. The princess came in on a throne, and the bearers carried her from\nplace to place. She did not seem to care for any one, and every one became\ndisappointed that this meeting also was going to be a failure. Just then came\na young man, a _Sannyasin_ , handsome as if the sun had come down to the\nearth, and stood in one corner of the assembly, watching what was going on.\nThe throne with the princess came near him, and as soon as she saw the\nbeautiful Sannyasin, she stopped and threw the garland over him. The young\n_Sannyasin_ seized the garland and threw it off, exclaiming, "What nonsense is\nthis? I am a Sannyasin. What is marriage to me?" The king of that country\nthought that perhaps this man was poor and so dared not marry the princess,\nand said to him, "With my daughter goes half my kingdom now, and the whole\nkingdom after my death!" and put the garland again on the _Sannyasin_. The\nyoung man threw it off once more, saying, "Nonsense. I do not want to marry,"\nand walked quickly away from the assembly.\n\nNow the princess had fallen so much in love with this young man that she said,\n"I must marry this man or I shall die;" and she went after him to bring him\nback. Then our other _Sannyasin_ , who had brought the king there, said to\nhim, "King, let us follow this pair; " so they walked after them, but at a\ngood distance behind. The young _Sannyasin_ who had refused to marry the\nprincess walked out into the country for several miles; when he came to a\nforest and entered into it, the princess followed him, and the other two\nfollowed them. Now\n\np. 48\n\nthis young _Sannyasin_ was well acquainted with that forest and knew all the\nintricate paths in it, he suddenly passed into one of these and disappeared,\nand the princess could not discover him. After trying for a long time to find\'\nhim she sat down under a tree and began to weep, for she did not know the way\nout. Then our king and the other _Sannyasin_ came up to her and said, "Do not\nweep; we will show you the way out of this forest, but it is too dark for us\nto find it now. Here is a big tree; let us rest under it, and in the morning\nwe will go early and show you the road."\n\nNow a little bird and his wife and their three little ones lived on that tree,\nin a nest. This little bird looked down and saw the three people under the\ntree and said to his wife, "My dear, what shall we do; here are some guests in\nthe house, and it is winter, and we have no fire?" So he flew away and got a\nbit of burning firewood in his beak and dropped it before the guests, to which\nthey added fuel and made a blazing fire. But the little bird was not\nsatisfied. He said again to his wife, "My dear, what shall we do? There is\nnothing to give these people to eat, and they are hungry. We are householders;\nit is our duty to feed any one who comes to the house. I must do what I can, I\nwill give them my body." So he plunged into the midst of the fire and\nperished. The guests saw him falling and tried to save him, but he was too\nquick for them.\n\nThe little bird\'s wife saw what her husband did, and she said, "Here are three\npersons and only one little bird for them to eat. It is not enough; it is my\nduty as a wife not to let my husband\'s effort go in vain; let them have my\nbody also;" then she fell into the fire and was burned to death.\n\nThen the three baby-birds, when they saw what was done and that there was\nstill not enough food for the three guests, said, "Our parents have done what\nthey could and\n\np. 49\n\nstill it is not enough. It is our duty to carry on the work of our parents;\nlet our bodies go too." And they all dashed down into the fire also.\n\nAmazed at what they saw, the three people could not of course eat these birds.\nThey passed the night without food and in the morning the king and the\nSannyasin showed the princess the way, and she went back to her father.\n\nThen the _Sannyasin_ said to the king, "King, you have seen that each is great\nin his own place. If you want to live in the world live like those birds,\nready at any moment to sacrifice yourself for others. If you want to renounce\nthe world be like that young man to whom the most beautiful woman and a\nkingdom were as nothing. If you want to be a householder hold your life a\nsacrifice for the welfare of others; and if you choose the life of\nrenunciation do not even look at beauty, and money and power. Each is great in\nhis own place, but the duty of the one is not the duty of the other."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III. The Secret of Work](kyog03.htm)\n\n'
