Of him who has merely read the Veda (there is qualification for works).\n\nAs the clause, 'Having learnt (read) the Veda from a family of teachers,'\nspeaks only of the reading, we determine that acts are there enjoined for him\nwho has only read the Veda.--But from this it would follow that on account of\nbeing destitute of knowledge such a person would not be qualified for works!--\nNever mind; we do not mean to deny that the understanding of sacrificial acts\nwhich springs from the reading of the texts is the cause of qualification for\ntheir performance; we only wish to establish that the knowledge of the Self\nderived from the Upanishads is seen to have an independent purpose of its own\nand therefore does not supply a reason of qualification for acts. Analogously\na person who is qualified for one act does not require the knowledge of\nanother act.\n\nAgainst the reasoning of Sutra 7 we make the following remark.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 13](sbe38222.htm)\n\n"
