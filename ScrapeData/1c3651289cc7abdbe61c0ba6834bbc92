Savitri said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Give me the devotion to the Devi to that \xc3\x82dya\nS\xc2\x92akti Bhagavati Maha Maye, Parames\xc2\x92vari Mayi that is the Essence of all\nessences, the Door of final liberation to the human beings, and the Cause of\ndelivering them from hells, that is the Root of all the Dharmas that lead to\nMukti, that destroys all the inauspiciousness, that takes away the fear of all\nthe Karmas, and that takes away always all the sins committed before. O Thou,\nthe Foremost amongst the knowers of the Vedas! How many kinds of Muktis are\nthere in this world? What is the True Bhakti? What are its characteristics?\nWhat is to be done by which the enjoyment of the karmas done can be desisted\nand nullified? O Bhagavan! The woman kind has been created by the Creator as\ndevoid of any Tattvaj\xc3\xb1ana or true knowledge; now tell me something about this\nTrue Knowledge. All the charities, sacrifices, bathing in the sacred places of\npilgrimages, observing vows and austerities cannot be compared with one\nsixteenth of imparting knowledge to those who are ignorant (of true\nknowledge). Mother is hundred times superior to father; this is certain; but\nthe Spiritual Teacher, the Giver of True Knowledge, is hundred times more to\nbe reverenced and worshipped than the mother. O Lord!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7-79. Dharmaraja said :-- O Child! What boons you desired of Me before, I\ngranted them all to you. Now I grant this boon to you that, \xc2\x93Let the devotion\ntowards the S\xc2\x92akti now arise in your mind.\xc2\x94 O Auspicious One! You want to hear\nthe reciting of the Glories of S\xc2\x92ri Devi; by this, both he who puts forward\nthe question and he who hears the answer, all their families are delivered.\nWhen the S\xc2\x92esa Naga Ananta Deva with His thousand mouths is unable to recite\nthe glories of the Devi, when Mahadeva cannot describe with His five mouths,\nwhen the Creator Brahma is incapable to recite Her glories with His four\nmouths, when Vi _sn_ u, the Omniscient, falls back, when Kartikeya with His\nsix mouths cannot sufficiently describe, when Ganes\xc2\x92a, the Guru of the Gurus\nof the great yogis is incapable, when the Pundits, the knowers of the four\nVedas, the Essence of all the S\xc2\x92astras, cannot know even a bit of Her, when\nSarasvati becomes inert in going to describe Her glories; when Sanatkumara,\nDharma, Sanatana, Sananda, Sanaka, Kapila, Surya and other sons of the Creator\nhave fallen back, when the other Siddhas, Yogindras, Munindras are quite\nincapable to glorify the deeds of Prakriti Devi, then how can I recite fully\nthe Glories of Her? Whose lotus-feet Brahma,\n\n\n\np. 953\n\n\n\nVi _sn_ u, S\xc2\x92iva and others meditate; and lo! when it becomes difficult for\nHer devotees even to think of Her, then what wonder is there that She will be\nso very rare to others! Brahma, skilled in the knowledge of the Vedas knows\nmore of Her than what other ordinary persons know so little of Her auspicious\nGlories. More than Brahma, Ganes\xc2\x92a, the Guru of the J\xc3\xb1anins, knows; again\nS\xc2\x92ambhu, the Omniscient, knows the best of all. For, in ancient times, the\nknowledge of the Prakriti Devi was given to Him by Kri _sn_ a, the Highest\nSpirit in a solitary place in the Rasa Ma _nd_ alam in the region of Goloka.\nMahadeva, again, gave it to Dharma in the S\xc2\x92ivaloka; Dharma again gave the\nPrakriti Mantra to My father. My father became successful (Siddha) in the\nworship of Prakriti Devi when he practised austerities. Of old, the Devas\nwanted to offer to me the Government of the Yama Loka; but as I was very much\ndispassionate towards the world, I became unwilling and became ready to\nperform austerities. Then my Father told the Glories of Prakriti Devi. Now I\ndescribe to you what I heard from my Father and what is stated in the Vedas,\nthough very difficult to comprehend. Listen carefully. O Fair Faced One! As\nthe eternal space does not know its own extent, so Prakriti Devi Herself knows\nnot Her own Glories; then what can be said of any other person on this! She is\nthe Self of all, endowed with all powers and lordship, the Cause of all\ncauses, the Lord of all, the Origin of all and the Preserver of all; She is\nEternal, always with Her Cosmic Body, full of everlasting bliss, without any\nspecial form, unrestrained, having no fear, without any disease and decay,\nunattached, the Witness of all, the Refuge of all, and Higher than the\nHighest; She is with Maya and She is Mula Prakriti; the objects created by Her\nbeing known as the Prakriti creation; Who remains as Prakriti and Puru _s_ a\ninseparable from each other as Ag _n_ i and Her burning force; the Maha Maya,\nof the nature of everlasting existence, intelligence and bliss. Though\nformless, She assumes forms for the gratification of the desires of Her\nBhaktas. She created first the beautiful form of Gopala Sundari, i.e., the\nform of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a very lovely and beautiful, captivating the mind. His\nbody is blue like the fresh rain cloud; He is young and dressed like that of a\ncow herd. Millions of Kandarpas (the Love deity) are, as it were, playing in\nhis body. His eyes vie with the midday lotus of the autumn. The beauty of His\nface throws under shade the millions and millions of the Full Moon. His body\nis decorated with invaluable ornaments decked with jewels. Sweet smile reigns\never in His lips; it is adorned moreover with His yellow coloured invaluable\nrobe. He is Parama Brahma. His whole body is burning with the Brahma Teja, the\nFire of Brahma.\n\n\n\np. 954\n\n\n\nHis Body is Fiery. He is lovely, sweet to look at, of a peaceful temper, the\nLord of Radha and He is Infinite. (Note :-- The Universe; as we see, is unreal\nlike what we see in the kaleidoscope; various apparent pictures of an endless\nvariety of beautiful colours and forms.) He is sitting on a jewel throne in\nthe Rasa Ma _nd_ alam, and is incessantly looked upon by the smiling lovely\nGopis at one and the same time. He is two-armed. A garland made of wild\nflowers is hanging from His neck. He is playing on His flute. His breast is\nresplendent with Kaustubha gem that He always wears. His body is anointed with\nKunkuma (saffron), aguru (the fragrant and cooling paste of the Aguru wood),\nmusk, and sandal-paste. The garland of beautiful Champaka and Malati flowers\nis hanging from His neck. On His head, the beautiful crest is being seen, a\nlittle obliquely situated in the form of the beautiful Moon. Thus the Bhaktas,\nfilled with Bhaktis, meditate on Him. O Child! It is through His fear that the\nCreator is doing His work of creation of this Universe; and is recording the\nPrarabdha fruits of their Karmas. It is through His fear that Vi _sn_ u is\nawarding the fruits of Tapas and preserving the Universe. By His command the\nKalagni Rudra Deva is destroying all. By Whose favour S\xc2\x92iva has become\nMrityumjaya, the Conqueror of Death and the Foremost of the J\xc3\xb1anins; knowing\nwhom S\xc2\x92iva has become Himself endowed with knowledge and the Lord of the\nknowers of knowledge, full of the Highest Bliss, devotion and dispassion.\nThrough Whose fear the wind becomes the foremost of runners and carries\nthings, the Sun gives heat, Indra gives rain, Yama destroys, Ag _n_ i burns,\nand Water cools all the things. By Whose command the Regents of the (ten)\nquarters of the sky are watching and preserving nice orders; through Whose\nfear the planets are describing their several orbits. Through Whose fear,\ntrees flower and yield fruits; By Whose command the Kala destroys all. By\nWhose command all the beings whether on land or in water are quitting their\nlives in time; until the proper time comes no man does not die even if he be\npierced whether in battle or in danger. By Whose command the wind supports the\nwater; the water supports the tortoise; the tortoise supports the Ananta and\nthe Ananta supports the earth; the earth supports the oceans, mountain and all\nthe jewels. The earth is of the nature of forgiveness, i.e., endures all. For\nthis reason all things, moving and non-moving, rest on Her and again melt away\nin Her. Seventy-one Divine Yugas constitute one Indra\xc2\x92s life period. Twenty-\neight Indra\xc2\x92s life periods constitute Brahma\xc2\x92s one day and one night. Thus\nthirty days constitute Brahma\xc2\x92s one month; so two months constitute one Ritu\n(season); six Ritus make one year. Thus one hundred years constitute Brahma\xc2\x92s\n\n\n\np. 955\n\n\n\nlife. When Brahma dies, S\xc2\x92ri Hari\xc2\x92s eye closes. That is the Prakritik Pralaya.\nAt this time, everything, moving and non-moving, from the Deva loka to Bhur\nloka (earth) dies. The Creator Brahma gets dissolved in the navel of S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a. The four-armed Vi _sn_ u, of Vaiku _nt_ ha, sleeps on K _s_ ira\nSamudra, the ocean of milk, i.e., He dissolves on the left side of S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a, the Highest Spirit. All the other S\xc2\x92aktis (forces) dissolve in Mula\nPrakriti, the Maya of Vi _sn_ u. The Mula Prakriti Durga, the Presiding Deity\nof Buddhi (reason) dissolves in the Buddhi of Kri _sn_ a. Skanda, the part of\nNaraya _n_ a, dissolves in His breast. Gane\xc2\x92sa, the foremost of the Devas,\nborn in part of Kri _sn_ a, dissolves in the arm of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. And those\nwho are born in parts of Padma, dissolve in Her body and Padma dissolves in\nthe body of Radha. All the cow-herdesses and all the bodies of the Devas\ndissolve in Radha\xc2\x92s body. But Radha, the Presiding Deity of the Pra _n_ a of\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, dissolves in the Pra _n_ a of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. Savitri, the\nfour Vedas and all the S\xc2\x92astras dissolve in Sarasvati; and Sarasvati gets\ndissolved in the tongue of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Highest Self. The Gopas in the\nregion of Goloka dissolve in the pores of His skin; the Pra _n_ a Vayu of all\ndissolve in His Pra _n_ a Vayu; the fire dissolves in the fire in His belly;\nwater dissolves in the tip of His tongue, and the Vai _sn_ avas, (devotees of\nVi _sn_ u), drinking the nectar of Bhakti, the Essence of all essences,\ndissolve in His lotus-feet. All smaller Virats dissolve in the Great Virat and\nthe Great Virat dissolves in the Body of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. O Child! He is Kri\n_sn_ a, on the pores of Whose skin are situated endless Universes; at the\nclosing of Whose eyes, the Prakritic Pralaya comes and on the opening of Whose\neyes, the creation takes place. The closing and opening of the eyes takes the\nsame time. Brahma\xc2\x92s creation lasts one hundred years and the Pralaya lasts one\nhundred years. O One of good vows! There is no counting how many Brahmas or\nhow many creations and dissolutions have taken place. As one cannot count the\nnumber of dusts, so one cannot count the creations and dissolutions. This is\nthe Great Unspeakable Wonder! Again on Whose closing of the eyes the Pralaya\ntakes place and on whose opening of the eyes the creation takes place, out of\nthe will of God, That Kri _sn_ a dissolves at the time of Pralaya in Prakriti.\nThis Highest S\xc2\x92akti, the Mula Prakriti is the Only One without a second; it is\nthe only one Nirgu _n_ a and the Highest Puru _s_ a. It is considered as \xc2\x93Sat\xc2\x94\nexisting, by the Seers of the Vedas. Such a thing as Mula Prakriti is the\nunchanged state (Mukti). During the Pralaya, this only One Mula Prakriti\nappears as J\xc3\xb1ana S\xc2\x92akti or the Knowledge Force. Who can in this universe\nrecite Her glories? Mukti is of four kinds.\n\n\n\np. 956\n\n\n\n(1) Salokya, (2) Sarupya, (3) Samipya and (4) Nirva _n_ a. So it is stated in\nthe Vedas. Out of them Bhakti towards the Deva is the highest; so much so that\nthe Deva Bhakti is superior to Mukti. Mukti gives Salokya, Sarupya, Samipya,\nand Nirva _n_ a. But the Bhaktas do not want anything. They want service of\nthe Lord. They do not want anything else. The state of becoming S\xc2\x92iva, of\nbecoming an Amara or an immortal, becoming a Brahma, the birth, death,\ndisease, old age, fear, sorrow, or wealth, or assuming a divine form, or Nirva\n_n_ a or Moksa all are looked on alike by the Bhaktas with disregard and\ncontempt. Because Mukti is without any service while Bhakti increases this\nservice. Thus I have told you the difference between Bhakti and Mukti. Now\nhear about the cutting off of the fruits of the past Karmas. O Chaste one!\nThis service of the Highest Lord severs the ties of Karmas (past acts). This\nservice is really the True Knowledge. So, O Child! I have now told you the\nReal Truth, leading to auspicious results. Now you can go freely as you\ndesire. Thus saying to Savitri, Yama, the son of Surya, gave life back to her\nhusband and blessing her, became ready to go to His own abode. Seeing\nDharmaraja ready to go away, Savitri became sorry to have the bereavement of a\ngood company, bowed down at His feet and began to cry. Yama, the Ocean of\nMercy, hearing the crying of Savitri began to weep and told the following\nwords :--\n\n\n\n80-96. Dharma said :-- O Child! You enjoy in this holy Bharata happiness for\none lakh years and you will in the end go to the Deviloka or Ma _n_ i Dvipa.\nNow go back to your house and observe for fourteen years the vow called\nSavitri-vrata for the mukti of women. This Vrata is to he observed on the\nfourteenth day of the white fortnight in the month of Jyaistha. Then observe\nthe Maha-Lak _s_ mi Vrata. Its proper time is the eighth day of the bright\nfortnight of the month of Bhadra. For sixteen years consecutively without any\nbreak this vow is to be observed. The woman who practises with devotion this\nvow, goes to the abode of Mula Prakriti. You would worship on every Tuesday in\nevery month the Devi Mangala Cha _nd_ ika, the giver of all good; on the\neighth day in the bright fortnight you should worship Devi Sa _st_ hi (i.e.,\nDevasena); you should worship Manasa Devi, the giver of all siddhis, on the\nSamkranti day (when the Sun enters another sign) in every year; you should\nworship Radha, the Central Figure of Rasa, more than the Pra _n_ a of Kri _sn_\na on every Full Moon night in the month of Kartik and you should observe\nfasting on the eighth day in the bright fortnight and worship the Vi _sn_ u\nMaya Bhagavati Devi, the Destructrix of all difficulties and dangers.\n\n\n\np. 957\n\n\n\n(Note :-- The Rasa is the playing out of the Vedantic saying of Brahma as\n\xc2\x93Raso vai Sah.\xc2\x94 He is of the nature of Rasa, the most sweet and lovely Divine\nPrinciple which unites the Rasika and the Rasika.) The chaste woman having\nhusband and sons who worships the World Mother Mula Prakriti, whether in\nYantra, or in Mantra or in image, enjoys all pleasures in this world; and, in\nthe end, goes to the Deviloka or Ma _n_ i Dvipa. O Child! The worshipper\nSadhaka (one who is in one\xc2\x92s way to success) must worship all the\nmanifestations of the Devi, day and night. At all times one must worship the\nomnipresent Durga, the Highest \xc3\x8esvari. There is no other way to attain\nblessedness than this. Thus saying, Dharmaraja went to His own abode. Savitri,\ntoo, with her husband Satyavan went to her home. Both Savitri and Satyavan,\nwhen they reached home, narrated all their stories to their friends and\nacquaintances. In time, by the blessing of Yama, Savitri\xc2\x92s father got sons and\nfather-in-law recovered his eye-sight and kingdom and Savitri Herself got\nsons. For one lakh years, Savitri enjoyed pleasures in this holy land of\nBharata, and ultimately went with her husband to the Deviloka. Savitri is the\nPresiding Deity of the Suryama _nd_ alam, the solar orb. The Sun is the\ncentral Para Brahma. The Gayatri Mantra, the Presiding Devi, proves the\nexistence of the highest Brahma in the centre of the Sun. Therefore She is\ncalled Savitri. Or Her name is Savitri because all the Vedas have come out of\nHer. Thus I have narrated the excellent anecdote of Savitri, and the fruitions\nof the Karmas of the several Jivas. Now what more do you want to hear? Say.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-eighth Chapter in the Ninth Book on the glories of the\nDevi and on the nature of Bhakti in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 39](bk09ch39.htm)\n\n'
