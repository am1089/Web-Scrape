And because (only such a connexion) is possible.\n\nMoreover, only such a connexion as described above is possible. For scriptural\npassages, such as 'He is gone to his Self ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 1), declare that\nthe connexion of the soul with the highest Self is one of essential nature.\nBut as the essential nature of a thing is imperishable, the connexion cannot\nbe analogous to that of the inhabitants with the town, but can only be\nexplained with reference to an obscuration, owing to Nescience, of the soul's\ntrue nature.--Similarly the difference spoken of by scripture cannot be real,\nbut only such as is due to Nescience; for many texts declare that there exists\nonly one Lord. Analogously, scripture teaches that the one ether is made\nmanifold as it were by its connexion with different places 'The ether which is\noutside man is the ether which is inside man, and the ether within the heart'\n( _Kh_.
