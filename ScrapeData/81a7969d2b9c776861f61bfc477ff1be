I choose Agni as Hot _ri_ at this sacrificial meal, the clever sage all-\nknowing and not foolish. May he, the excellent sacrificer, sacrifice for us\namid the host of the gods; may he obtain liberal boons (for us) for the sake\nof wealth and strength.\n\n2\\. To thee, O Agni, I stretch forth the (ladle) rich in sacrificial food,\nsplendid, full of gifts, full of ghee. From left to right, choosing the host\nof the gods [1](sbe46079.htm#an_3:19:2:1), he has established the sacrifice\nwith gifts and goods [2](sbe46079.htm#an_3:19:2:2).\n\n3\\. Whoever is favoured by thee, is blessed with the sharpest spirit. Favour\nhim with good offspring, O god rich in favours [1](sbe46079.htm#an_3:19:3:1)!\nAgni, may we, (dwelling) in the copiousness of manliest wealth, be rich in\nperfect praise of thee, the Vasu.\n\n4\\. On thee indeed, O Agni, sacrificing men have put many faces of (thee) the\ngod [1](sbe46079.htm#an_3:19:4:1). Bring hither then the host of the gods, O\nyoungest one, when thou wilt sacrifice to-day to the divine host\n[2](sbe46079.htm#an_3:19:4:2).\n\n5\\. When the gods will anoint thee as the Hot _ri_ at the sacrificial meal\nmaking thee sit down for the sacrifice, be thou here, O Agni, our furtherer,\nand bestow glory on our bodies.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Gathin Kau _s_ ika, the metre Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 3 = TS. I,\n3, 14, 6; MS. IV, 14, 15.\n\np. 280\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. below, IV, 6, 3. This parallel passage shows that pradakshi _n_\nit belongs to ura _n_ a _h_ , not to a _s_ ret. Agni is represented as\nchoosing, i. e. inviting the host of the gods by moving around the sacrificial\nfood from left to right. See concerning the Paryagnikara _n_ a, which seems to\nbe alluded to, Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, 42 seq.\n\nNote 2. Or, 'with the (divine) givers and with the Vasus.'\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Boehtlingk-Roth seem to be right in reading _s_ iksho. Comp. VIII, 52,\n8. yasmai tvam \xe2\x80\xa6 _s_ iksho _s_ ikshasi da _s_ ushe.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. They have inflamed many fires, each of which is a face of the god\nAgni.\n\nNote 2. Or, 'that thou mayest sacrifice,' &c. See Delbruck, Syntaktische\nForschungen, I, 148.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 20](sbe46080.htm)\n\n"
