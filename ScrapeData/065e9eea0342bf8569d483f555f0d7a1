Now those who repeat the Nirbhuga say:\n\n2\\. \'The former half 1 is the first syllable, the latter half the second\nsyllable, and the space between the first and second halves is the Sa _m_ hita\n(union).\'\n\n3\\. He who thus knows this Sa _m_ hita (union), becomes united with offspring,\ncattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full\nage.\n\n4\\. Now Hrasva Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya says: \'We reciters of Nirbhuga say, "Yes, the\nformer half is the first syllable, and the latter half the second syllable,\nbut the Sa _m_ hita is the space between the first and second halves in so far\nas by it one turns out the union (sandhi), and knows what is the accent and\nwhat is not 2, and distinguishes what is the mora and what is not."\'\n\n5\\. He who thus knows this Sa _m_ hita (union), becomes united with offspring,\ncattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full\nage.\n\n6\\. Now his middle son, the child of his mother Pratibodhi 3, says: \'One\npronounces these two syllables letter by letter, without entirely separating\n\np. 254\n\nthem, and without entirely uniting them 1. Then that mora between the first\nand second halves, which indicates the union, that is the Saman (evenness,\nsliding). I therefore hold Saman only to be the Sa _m_ hita (union).\n\n7\\. This has also been declared by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. II, 23, 16):--\n\n8\\. \'O B _ri_ haspati, they know nothing higher than Saman.\'\n\n9\\. He who thus knows this Sa _m_ hita (union), becomes united with offspring,\ncattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full\nage.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[253:1](sbe01231.htm#fr_646) As spoken of before, III, 1, 1, 1.\n\n[253:2](sbe01231.htm#fr_647) In agnim i _l_ e, i _l_ e by itself has no\naccent, but as joined by sandhi with agnim, its first syllable becomes\nsvarita, its second pra _k_ ita. In tava it, the vowel i is a short mora or\nmatra; but if joined with va, it vanishes, and becomes long e, tavet. Comm.\n\n[253:3](sbe01231.htm#fr_648) Pratibodhiputra, the son of Pratibodhi, she being\nprobably one out of several wives of Hrasva. Another instance of this\nmetronymic nomenclature occurred in K _ri_ sh _n_ a Devakiputra, _Kh_. Up.\nIII, 7, 6. The Kashmir MS. reads Pra _k_ ibodhi, but Pratibodha is a\nrecognised name in Ga _n_ a Vidadi, and the right reading is probably\nPratibodhi. The same MS. leaves out putra aha.\n\n[254:1](sbe01231.htm#fr_649) So that the e in tavet should neither be one\nletter e, nor two letters a + i, but something between the two, enabling us to\nhear a + i in the pronunciation of e.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 6](sbe01232.htm)\n\n'
