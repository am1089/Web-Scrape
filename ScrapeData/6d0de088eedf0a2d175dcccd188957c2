Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! I will now describe the motion of the\nSun. Hear. It is of three kinds; S\xc2\x92ighra (perihelionic), Manda (Aphelionic),\nand even. O Surasattama! Every planet has three positions. The name of the\nMadhyagati position is Jaradgava, the name of the northern position is\nAiravata; and the name of the southern position is Vais\xc2\x92vanara. The asterisms\nAs\xc2\x92vini Krittika and Bhara _n_ i are known by the term Nagavithi. Rohi _n_ i,\n\xc3\x82rdra, and Mrigas\xc2\x92ira are named Gaja Vithi; Pu _s_ ya, As\xc2\x92le _s_ a, and\nPunarvasu are named Airavativithi. The three Vithis, above-mentioned are\ncalled Uttara Marga. Purvaphalguni, Uttara Phalguni and Magha are named A\xc2\x92r\n_s_ abhi Vithi. Hasta, Chitra and Svati are called Govithi; Jye _st_ ha,\nVis\xc2\x92akha and Anuradha are named Jaradgavi Vithi. These three Vithis are named\nMadhyama Marga. Mula, Purba _s_ a _d_ ha, Uttara _s_ a _d_ ha are termed\nAjavithi S\xc2\x92rava _n_ a, Dhani _s_ tha and S\xc2\x92atabhi _s_ a are termed Mriga\nVithi. Uttara bhadrapada, Purvabhadrapada, and Revati are called\nVais\xc2\x92vanarivithi. These three Vithis (paths) are called Dak _s_ i _n_ amarga.\nDuring the Uttaraya _n_ a time, as the Dhruva attracts the rope of air from\nboth the sides of the Yuga, orbit (or axis), the chariot of the Sun ascends,\n(i.e., is drawn up by the rope). Thus when the Sun enters within the sphere,\nthe motion of the chariot becomes slower and the day is lengthened and the\nnight is shortened. O Sura Sattama! Know this to be the course of the path of\nthe Sun.\n\n\n\nWhen the cord draws towards the south, the Chariot descends and as the Sun\nthen comes out of the sphere, the motion becomes quick. The day shortens and\nthe night is lengthened. Again when the cord is neither tightened nor is it\nslackened, rather its motion is exactly mid-way, the Sun also remains in a\nmedium position and his Chariot enters within a sphere of equilibrium and the\nday and night become equal. When the cord of air, in a state of equilibrium is\nattracted by the Polar Star, then it is that the Sun and the Solar system\nrevolves; and when the Polar Star slackens its attraction over the cord of\nair, the Sun coming out of the middle sphere, revolves; and the Solar system\nalso revolves. On the east of Meru is established the city of Indra and the\nDevas dwell there. It is called therefore Devadhanika. On the south\n\n\n\np. 774\n\n\n\nof the Meru, is the famous city of Yama, the God of Death, named Samyamani. On\nthe west of Meru, is the great city of Varu _n_ a, named Nimnochani. On the\nnorth of Meru is the city of the Moon, named Vibhavari. O Narada! The\nBrahmavadis say that the Sun first rises in the city of Indra. At noon the Sun\ngoes to Samyamani; at evening the Sun goes to Nimnochani and He is said to\nset. In the night the Sun remains in Vibhavari. O Muni! The going of the Sun\nround Meru is the cause of all the beings getting themselves engaged in their\nrespective duties. The inhabitants of the Meru see the Sun always in the\ncentral position. The Sun moves on, eastwards towards the stars, keeping the\nMeru to his left; but if the Zodiac be taken into account, it would appear\nthat the Meru is left towards the south of the Sun. The rising and the setting\nof the Sun are always considered in front of Him. O Devar _s_ i! Every point,\nevery quarter, every person, seeing the Sun says that the Sun has risen there;\nagain where he becomes invisible, He is considered to set there. The Sun\nalways exists; so there is no rising nor setting for Him. It is His appearance\nand disappearance that make men say that the Sun rises or sets. When the Sun\nis in the Indra\xc2\x92s city, He illumines the three cities, those of Indra, Yama,\nand the Moon and illumines the north-east and east-west corners. So when He\nrests in the city of Fire, he illumines north-east, east-west, and south-west,\nthe three corners, and at the same time the cities of Indra and Yama; and so\non for the other cities and corners. O Narada! The Mont Meru is situated\ntowards the north of all the Dvipas and Var _s_ as. So whenever any person\nsees the Sun rise he calls that side \xc2\x93east.\xc2\x94 But Meru exists towards the left\nof the Sun; so it is said. If the Sun travels in 15 (fifteen) Gha _t_ ikas,\nthe distance from Indrapuri to Yamapuri, He is said to travel within that time\na distance equal to 2\xc2\xbc Ko _t_ is, 12\xc2\xbd lakhs and 25000 Yojanas (22695000\nYojanas). The thousand-eyed and thousand rayed Sun God is the Manifester of\nTime. He travels in the aforesaid way the cities of Varu _n_ a, Chandra and\nIndra respectively. He is the diadem of the Svarloka; and the Zodiac is his\n\xc3\x82tman. He travels thus, to mark off time to all persons. O Narada! The Moon\nand the other planets and stars rise and set in the aforesaid manner. Thus the\npowerful chariot of the Sun travels in a Muhurta 142,00000 Yojanas. By the\nforce of Pravaha Vayu (air), the Sun God, the Incarnate of the Vedas travels\nround the cities, the Zodiac, in one Samvatsara (year). The wheel of the Sun\xc2\x92s\nChariot is one year; twelve months are the spokes; three Chaturmasyas are the\nnave and the six seasons are the outer ring or circumference of the wheel. The\nlearned men call this chariot as the\n\n\n\np. 775\n\n\n\nSamvatsara (one year). The axis or axle points to the Meru on one side and to\nManasottara mountain on the other. The end or circumference of the wheel marks\noff other divisions of the time as Kala, Ka _st_ ha, Muhurta, Yama, Parahara,\nday and night, and fortnights. The wheel is fixed on the nave. The Sun goes on\nthis wheel, like an oilman\xc2\x92s on his oil-machine, round and round the\nManasottara mountain. The eastern side of the wheel is on that axis and the\nother part is fixed on the Pole Star. The dimension of the first axis is\n(15750000 Yoyanas). The second axis measures one-fourth of the above (3937500\nYoyanas). It resembles the axis of an oil-machine. The upper side of that is\nconsidered to belong to the Sun. The seat of the Sun on his chariot measures\n36 Lakh Yoyanas wide. The Yuga measures in length one fourth of the above\ndimensions, that of his seat. The Chariot is is moved by seven horses,\nconsisting of the seven Chhandas, Gayatri, etc., driven by Aru _n_ a. The\nhorses carry the Sun for the happiness of all. Though the charioteer sits in\nfront of the Sun, his face is turned towards the west. He does his work as a\ncharioteer in that state. Sixty thousand Valakhilya Ri _s_ is, of the size of\na thumb, chant the sweet Vedic hymns before Him. Other Ri _s_ is, Apsaras,\nUragas, Grama _n_ is, Rak _s_ asas, and all the Devas, each divided in groups\nof seven, worship every month that highly lustrous Sun-god. The earth measures\n90152000 Kros\xc2\x92a Yuga Yoyanas (1 Kro _s_ a - \xc2\xbc Yoyana). The Sun passes over\nthis distance in a moment. He does not take rest in his this work even for a\nday; no, not even for a moment.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifteenth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the motion of the Sun in\nthe Mahapura _n_ am, S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 16](bk08ch16.htm)\n\n"
