Narada said :-- O Bhagavan! I have heard from you all about the Kavacha\nand the Mantra of S\xc2\x92ri Gayatri. O Deva Deva! O Thou, the Knower of the\npresent, the past, and the future! Now tell about the Hridaya, the highest,\nthe interior or esoteric Essence of the Gayatri, holding which, if one repeats\nthe Gayatri, he acquires all the pu _n_ yam (merits), I am desirous to hear\nthis.\n\n\n\n3-8. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! This subject on the Hridaya of Gayatri is\nexplicitly written in the Atharva Veda. Now I will speak on that, the great\nsecret, in detail. Listen. First, consider the Gayatri, the Devi, the Mother\nof the Vedas as of a Cosmic Form (Vira _t_ rupa) and meditate all the Devas as\nresiding on Her Body. Now in as much as the Pi _nd_ a and Brahma _nd_ a are\nsimilar, consider yourself as of the form of the Devi and meditate within\nyourself on the Devatas, thus :-- The Pundits, the Knowers of the Vedas, say\nthis :-- He is not yet fit to worship the Deva and he is not an Adhikari as\nyet who has not been able to make himself a Deva; therefore to establish the\nknowledge of the oneness of the Deva and himself, he is to meditate the Devas\nwithin his body, thus :--\n\n\n\nO Narada! Now I will speak on the Hridaya of Gayatri, knowing which every man\nbecomes able to become all the Devas. Listen. The Ri _s_ i of this Gayatri\nHridaya is Naraya _n_ a; the Chhandas is Gayatri; and S\xc2\x92ri Parames'vari\nGayatri is the Devata. Perform the Nyasa of this as mentioned before and\ntaking your seat in a lonely place, meditate intently on the Devi with your\nheart and head well collected. Now I am speaking of the Arthanyasa. Hear.\nMeditate on the Devata Dyau on your head; the twin As'vins on the rows of the\nteeth; the two Sandhyas on your upper and lower lips; the Agni, Fire, within\nyour mouth; Sarasvati, on the tongue; Brihaspati on the neck; the eight Vasus\non the two breasts; the Vayus, on the two arms; the Paryanya Deva on the\nheart; \xc3\x82kas'a, on the belly; Antarik _s_ am (the middle space) on the navel;\nIndra and Agni, on the loins; Prajapati, the condensed form, as it were, of\nVij\xc3\xb1ana, on the hip joints; the Kailas'a and the Malaya mountains on the two\nthighs; the Visvedevas on the two knees; Vis'vamitra on the shanks; the Sun's\nnorthern and southern paths, the Uttarayana and Dak _s_ i _n_ ayana\n\n\n\np. 1144\n\n\n\non the anus; the Pitris on the thighs; the Earth on the legs; the Vanaspati on\nthe fingers and toes; the Ri _s_ is on the hairs of the body; the Muhurtas on\nthe nails; the planets on the bones; the Ritus (seasons) on the blood and\nflesh; the Samvatsaras on the Nimi _s_ a (twinkling of eye) the Sun and the\nMoon on the day and night respectively. Thinking thus, repeat \xc2\x93I take refuge\nof the Divine Holy Gayatri, the Chief and most Excellent One, the Thousand\neyed and I take refuge wholly unto Her.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThen repeat \xc2\x93I bow down to Tat savitur vare _n_ yam,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93I bow down to the\nRising Sun on the East,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93I bow down to the Morning Aditya,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93I bow down to\nthe Gayatri, residing in the Morning Sun\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93I bow down to all.\xc2\x94 O Narada!\nWhoever recites this Gayatri Hridaya in the morning finds all the sins\ncommitted in the night all destroyed! Whoever recites this in the evening gets\nhis sins of the day all destroyed! Whoever recites this in the evening and in\nthe morning can rest assured to have become free of sins; he gets the fruits\nof all the Tirthas; he is acquainted with all the Devas; he is saved if he has\nspoken anything that ought not to have been spoken; if he has eaten anything\nthat is not fit to be eaten; if he has chewn and sucked anything that ought\nnot to have been chewn and sucked; if he has done anything that ought not to\nhave been done and if he has accepted hundreds and thousands of gifts that\nought never to have been accepted.\n\n\n\nThe sins incurred by eating with the others in a line cannot touch him. If he\nspeaks lies, he will not be touched by the sins thereof; even if a non-\nBrahmachari recites this, he will become a Brahmachari. O Narada! What more\nshall I say to you of the results of Gayatri Hridaya than this :-- that\nwhoever will study this will acquire the fruits of performing thousand\nsacrifices and repeating the Gayatri sixty thousand times. In fact, he will\nget Siddhi by this. The Brahma _n_ a, who daily reads this in the morning will\nbe freed of all the sins and go upwards to the Brahma (Loka) and is glorified\nthere. This has been uttered by Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a Himself.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourth Chapter of the Twelfth Book on Gayatri Hridaya in the\nMahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk12ch05.htm)\n\n"
