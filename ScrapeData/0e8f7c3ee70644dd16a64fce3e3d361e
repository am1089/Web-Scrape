On the following day he sacrifices a cow to the Fathers.\n\n2. 2 Having put wood on the fire and strewn southward-pointed and eastward-pointed Darbha grass around it, he sacrifices the oblation for the touching of the animal (see below), with (the verse), 'This cow I touch for the Fathers; may my assembled fathers gladly accept it (which is offered) with fat and ghee, with the word svadha; may it satiate my fathers in the other world. Svadha! Adoration!' Then he touches (the cow) with one (blade of) sacrificial grass and with an unforked Vapa _s_ rapa _n_ i of Udumbara wood, with (the formula), 'I touch thee agreeable to the Fathers.'\n\n3\\. He sprinkles (the cow with water) with (the words), 'I sprinkle thee\nagreeable to the Fathers.'\n\n4. 4 When it has been sprinkled and fire has been\n\np. 235\n\ncarried round it, they kill it to the west of the fire, its head being turned\nto the west, its feet to the south.\n\n5. 5 After it has been killed, he silently 'strengthens' its sense-organs (by touching them) with water, and silently takes out the omentum, the heart, and the kidneys.\n\n6\\. With the Vapa _s_ rapa _n_ i of Udumbara wood he roasts the omentum; with\nspits of Udumbara wood the other (parts mentioned in Sutra 5) separately.\n\n7\\. After he has roasted them, and has sprinkled \xc3\x82 _g_ ya over them, and has\ntaken them from the fire, he sprinkles water round (the fire) from right to\nleft, puts a piece of Udumbara wood on (the fire), and sacrifices with a Darvi\nspoon of Udumbara wood the omentum, spreading under and sprinkling over it (\xc3\x82\n_g_ ya), with (the verse), 'Carry the omentum, _G_ atavedas, to the Fathers,\nwhere thou knowest them resting afar. May streams of fat flow to them; may\ntheir wishes with all their desires be fulfilled. Svadha! Adoration!'\n\n8. 8 He sacrifices the omentum entirely. The other parts (Sutra 5) he should offer to the Brahma _n_ as and should feed them (with those parts of the cow).\n\n9\\. When the food (for the Brahma _n_ as) is ready, he cuts off (the Avadanas)\ntogether from the mess of boiled rice, and from the pieces of meat, and mixing\nthem with clarified butter he makes oblations\n\np. 236\n\nthereof with the verses, 'Behold the Ekash _t_ aka, the giver of food with\nmeat and ghee, (which is offered) with (the word) svadha. By the Brahma _n_ as\nthat food is purified. May it be an imperishable (blessing) to me! Svadha!\nAdoration!'\n\n'The Ekash _t_ aka, devoting herself to austerities, the consort of the year,\nexuberant (with milk), has poured forth milk. May you live on that milk, O\nFathers, all together. May this (food) be well offered and well sacrificed by\nme! Svadha! Adoration!\n\n'The image of the year' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. V, 7, 2, 1).\n\n10\\. After he has sacrificed, he cuts off (the Avadanas) from the food and\nfrom the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes an\noblation with (the formula), 'To Agni Kavyavahana Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t svadha!\nAdoration!'\n\n11. 11 The known (rites) down to the pouring out of the handfuls of water (are performed here) as at the monthly ( _S_ raddha).\n\n12. 12 The gifts of food and presents, however, are not necessary here.\n\n13. 13 On the following day, he prepares food for the Fathers with the rest of the meat, and sacrifices with (the two verses), 'Thou, Agni, art quick,' (and), Pra _g_ apati!' (see above, I, 1, 3, 5).\n\n14\\. (= Sutra 11).\n\nEnd of the Fifth Pa _t_ ala.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[234:2](sbe30087.htm#fr_689) 15, 2.
