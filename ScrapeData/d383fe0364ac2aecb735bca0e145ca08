 \nAh, happy brothers! you have paid  \nDue offerings to his parting shade.  \nE'en when my banishment is o'er,  \nBack to my home I go no more,  \nTo look upon the widowed state  \nReft of her king, disconsolate.  \nE'en then, O tamer of the foe,  \nIf to Ayodhya's town I go.  \nWho will direct me as of old,  \nNow other worlds our father hold?  \nFrom whom, my brother, shall I hear  \nThose words which ever charmed mine ear  \nAnd filled my bosom with delight  \nWhene'er he saw me act aright?'  \n   Thus Rama spoke: then nearer came  \nAnd looking on his moonbright dame,  \n'Sit'a, the king is gone,' he said:  \n   'And Lakshman, know thy sire is dead,  \n\np. 212  \n\nAnd with the Gods on high enrolled:  \nThis mournful news has Bharat told.'  \nHe spoke: the noble youths with sighs  \nRained down the torrents from their eyes.  \nAnd then the brothers of the chief  \nWith words of comfort soothed his grief:  \n'Now to the king our sire who swayed  \nThe earth be due libations paid.'  \nSoon as the monarch's fate she knew,  \nSharp pangs of grief smote Sita through:  \nNor could she look upon her lord  \nWith eyes from which the torrents poured.  \nAnd Rama strove with tender care  \nTo soothe the weeping dame's despair,  \nAnd then, with piercing woe distressed,  \nThe mournful Lakshman thus addressed:  \n'Brother, I pray thee bring for me  \nThe pressed fruit of the Ingudi,  \nAnd a bark mantle fresh and new,  \nThat I may pay this offering due.  \nFirst of the three shall Sita go,  \nNext thou, and I the last: for so  \nMoves the funereal pomp of woe.' 1  \n   Sumantra of the noble mind,  \nGentle and modest, meek and kind,  \nWho, follower of each princely youth,  \nTo Rama clung with constant truth,  \nNow with the royal brothers' aid  \nThe grief of Rama soothed and stayed,  \nAnd lent his arm his lord to guide  \nDown to the river's holy side.  \nTnat lovely stream the heroes found,  \nWith woods that ever blossomed crowned,  \nAnd there in bitter sorrow bent  \nTheir footsteps down the fair descent.  \nThen where the stream that swiftly flowed  \nA pure pellucid shallow showed,  \nThe funeral drops they duly shed,  \nAnd 'Father, this be thine,' they said.  \nBut he, the lord who ruled the land,  \nFilled from the stream his hollowed hand,  \nAnd turning to the southern side  \nStretched out his arm and weeping cried:  \n'This sacred water clear and pure,  \nAn offering which shall aye endure  \nTo thee, O lord of kings, I give:  \nAccept it where the spirits live!'  \n   Then, when the solemn rite was o'er,  \nCame Rama to the river shore,  \nAnd offered, with his brothers' aid,  \nFresh tribute to his father's shade.  \n\nWith jujube fruit he mixed the seed  \nOf Ingudis from moisture freed,  \nAnd placed it on a spot o'erspread  \nWith sacred grass, and weeping said:  \n'Enjoy, great King, the cake which we  \nThy children eat and offer thee!  \nFor ne'er do blessed Gods refuse  \nTo share the food which mortals use.'  \n   Then Rama turned him to retrace  \nThe path that brought him to the place,  \nAnd up the mountain's pleasant side  \nWhere lovely lawns lay fair, he hied.  \nSoon as his cottage door he gained.  \nHis brothers to his breast he strained.  \nFrom them and Sit'a in their woes  \nSo loud the cry of weeping rose,  \nThat like the roar of lions round  \nThe mountain rolled the echoing sound.  \nAnd Bharat's army shook with fear  \nThe weeping of the chiefs to hear.  \n'Bharat,' the soldiers cried, ''tis plain,  \nHis brother Rama meets again,  \nAnd with these cries that round us ring  \nThey sorrow for their sire the king.'  \nThen leaving car and wain behind,  \nOne eager thought in every mind,  \nSwift toward the weeping, every man,  \nAs each could find a passage, ran.  \nSome thither bent their eager course  \nWith car, and elephant, and horse,  \nAnd youthful captains on their feet  \nWith longing sped their lord to meet,  \nAs though the new-come prince had been  \nAn exile for long years unseen.  \nEarth beaten in their frantic zeal  \nBy clattering hoof and rumbling wheel,  \nSent forth a deafening noise as loud  \nAs heaven when black with many a cloud,  \nThen, with their consorts gathered near,  \nWild elephants in sudden fear  \nRushed to a distant wood, and shed  \nAn odour round them as they fled.  \nAnd every silvan thing that dwelt  \nWithin those shades the terror felt,  \nDeer, lion, tiger, boar and roe,  \nBison, wild-cow, and buffalo.  \nAnd when the tumult wild they heard.  \nWith trembling pinions flew each bird,  \nFrom tree, from thicket, and from lake,  \nSwan, koil, curlew, crane, and drake.  \nWith men the ground was overspread,  \nWith startled birds the sky o'erhead.  \nThen on his sacrificial ground  \nThe sinless, glorious chief was found.  \nLoading with curses deep and loud  \nThe hump-back and the queen, the crowd.  \nWhose checks were wet, whose eyes were dim,  \nIn fond affection ran to him.  \nWhile the big tears their eyes bedewed,  \nHe looked upon the multitude,  \n\np. 213  \n\nAnd then as sire and mother do,  \nHis arms about his loved ones threw.  \n   Some to his feet with reverence pressed,  \n     Some in his arms he strained:  \n   Each friend, with kindly words addressed,  \n     Due share of honour gained.  \n   Then, by their mighty woe o'ercome,  \n     The weeping heroes' cry  \n   Filled, like the roar of many a drum,  \n     Hill, cavern, earth, and sky.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[212:1](ry181.htm#fr_379) 'The order of the procession on these occasions is\nthat the children precede according to age, then the women and after that the\nmen according to age, the youngest first and the eldest last: when they\ndescend into the water this is reversed and resumed when they come out of it.'\n\n               CAREY AND MAKSHMAN.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto CIV.: The Meeting With The Queens.](ry182.htm)\n\n"
