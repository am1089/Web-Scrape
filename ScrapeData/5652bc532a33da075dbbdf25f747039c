'In the beginning,' my dear, 'there was that only which is (\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd), one\nonly, without a second. Others say, in the beginning there was that only which\nis not (\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb4 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd), one only, without a second; and from that which is not,\nthat which is was born.\n\n2\\. 'But how could it be thus, my dear?' the father continued. 'How could that\nwhich is, be born of that which is not? No, my dear, only that which is, was\nin the beginning, one only, without a second.\n\n3\\. 'It thought 2, may I be many, may I grow forth. It sent forth fire 3.\n\np. 94\n\n'That fire 1 thought, may I be many, may I grow forth. It sent forth water 2.\n\n'And therefore whenever anybody anywhere is hot and perspires, water is\nproduced on him from fire alone.\n\n4\\. 'Water thought, may I be many, may I grow forth. It sent forth earth 3\n(food).\n\n'Therefore whenever it rains anywhere, most food is then produced. From water\nalone is eatable food produced.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[93:1](sbe01120.htm#fr_271) Cf. Taitt. Up. II, 6.\n\n[93:2](sbe01120.htm#fr_272) Literally, it saw. This verb is explained as\nshowing that the Sat is conscious, not unconscious (bewusst, nicht unbewusst).\n\n[93:3](sbe01120.htm#fr_273) In other Upanishads the Sat produces first aka _s_\na, ether, then vayu, air, and then only te _g_ as, fire. Fire is a better\nrendering for te _g_ as than light or heat. See Jacobi, Zeitschrift der\nDeutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XXIX, p. 242. The difficulties, however, of\np. 94 accurately translating tegas are not removed by rendering if by fire, as\nmay be seen immediately afterward in VI, 4, 1, where te _g_ as is said to\nsupply the red colour of agni, the burning fire, not the god of fire. See also\nVI, 8, 6. In later philosophical treatises the meaning of te _g_ as is more\ncarefully determined than in the Upanishads.\n\n[94:1](sbe01120.htm#fr_274) Really the Sat, in the form of fire. Fire is\nwhatever burns, cooks, shines, and is red.\n\n[94:2](sbe01120.htm#fr_275) By water is meant all that is fluid, and bright in\ncolour.\n\n[94:3](sbe01120.htm#fr_276) By anna, food, is here meant the earth, and all\nthat is heavy, firm, dark in colour.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 3](sbe01121.htm)\n\n"
