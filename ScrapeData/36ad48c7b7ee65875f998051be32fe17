Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: Tell pre, O Lord, about the method of [performing] the\nSapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da rite. the removal of pollution, and the gift of accessories.\n\n2\\. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, and I will explain to you the\nentire Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da rite, by which the condition of preta is left behind and the\nsoul enters the class of the pit\xe1\xb9\x9bis.\n\n3-5. Those whose pi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8das have not been mixed together with the ancestors called\n\xc5\x9aiva and the rest, 1 are not uplifted by the various gifts made by the sons.\n\nIf the son is always impure, they are never purified; without the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da rite\nthe impurity does not depart.\n\nTherefore the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da, at the end of the pollution period, should be performed\nby the son. I will tell you about the ending of pollution to be observed by\nall.\n\np. 115\n\n6-9. A Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 becomes pure in ten days, a K\xe1\xb9\xa3attriya in twelve days; a Vai\xc5\x9bya\nin fifteen days, a \xc5\x9a\xc5\xabdra in a month.\n\nThe Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da relatives 1 are purified from the death pollution in ten days; the\nS\xc4\x81kulya relatives 2 in three nights, and the gotraj\xc4\x81s 3 are purified merely by\nbathing.\n\nThose who are related within the fourth degree to the deceased are purified in\nten nights, those in the fifth degree, in six nights; the sixth, four days;\nthe seventh, three days;\n\nThe eighth, a single day; the ninth, a quarter of a day; the tenth, merely\ntill bathing;--so long lasts the pollution of death and birth [according to\nthe distance of degrees from the deceased].\n\n10-11. If a person dies in a foreign land and one hears of his death, then the\nimpurity lasts for the remaining portion of ten days on which he hears the\nnews;\n\nIf after the lapse of ten days, he is polluted for three nights. If after a\nyear, he becomes pure even by bathing.\n\n12\\. If a second pollution comes daring that from the first death, then the\npurification from the first pollution includes that from the second.\n\n13\\. If a boy who has not yet cut his teeth dies, purification is immediate;\nbefore tonsure, one night, it is said; before the investiture with the thread,\nthree nights; and afterwards, ten nights.\n\n14-16. If a girl dies between birth and tonsure, purification is immediate, in\nall the castes alike;\n\np. 116\n\nUp to betrothal a single day, and from that to old age three nights are\nauthoritative;\n\nIf after the betrothal ceremony three days for both families, it should be\nunderstood; if after marriage, only the husband\'s family.\n\n17-18. If the embryo dies before sixth month; in as many days the embryo lived\nmonths, purity is regained.\n\nAfter this the women are polluted, according to the caste. If the embryo dies,\npurification of the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da relatives is immediate.\n\n19\\. During the Kali Age--it is authoritatively declared in the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras--ten\ndays\' purification for all the castes, after births and deaths.\n\n20-22. Blessing the worship of the Shining Ones, reception of guests,\nsalutation, lying on a bed, and touching others should not he done during the\ndeath pollution.\n\nSandhy\xc4\x81 prayers, giving, reciting, fire-offering, religious study, offering to\nthe forefathers, feeding of Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s and the observance of vows should not be\ndone during the death pollution.\n\nHe who during pollution performs the daily, the occasional and the specially\ndesired ceremonies--of him the regular and other ceremonies already done are\nlost.\n\n23\\. For one observing vows, engaged in mantras or in fire-offerings, or a\ntwice-born intent upon Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87, an ascetic or a king there is verily no\npollution.\n\np. 117\n\n24-26. Food prepared before marriage festivals and sacrifices, and before the\npollution by birth or death, can be eaten; so Manu declared.\n\nWhoever, during pollution, accepts through ignorance, suffers no evil, but the\ngiver even though it be to a mendicant that he gives, suffers evil.\n\nWhoever, hiding his pollution, gives food to a twice-born, and the Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 who\nknowing it, accepts it,--are both subjected to suffering.\n\n27\\. Therefore, for the purifying from pollution, one should perform the\nSapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da ceremony for the father, who then goes to the world of the forefathers\nto join the multitudes of forefathers.\n\n28-30. The truth-knowing sages hare declared that the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da ceremony should\nbe on the twelfth day, the third fortnight, the sixth month or at the end of\nthe year.\n\nBut I say, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, following the scriptural ordinances, that for the four\ncastes the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da should be on the twelfth day.\n\nThe twelfth day is preferable because of the endless variety of conditions in\nthe Kali Age, and because of the shortened life of men, and the impermanence\nof the body.\n\n31-33. If a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 house-holder dies, then investiture with the sacred\nthread, the fulfilment of vows, marriage and other ceremonies should not be\ndone,\n\np. 118\n\nUntil the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da has been performed the mendicant should not accept alms; and\nguest-offerings should not be accepted. The daily and the occasional\nceremonies should be discontinued.\n\nBy the omission of rites sinfulness arises; therefore one should perform the\nSapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da ceremony on the twelfth day, whether he be without fire or with fire.\n\n34\\. The fruit which accrues from visiting all the sacred bathing-places; the\nfruit which accrues from performing all sacrifices: that fruit is obtained by\ndoing the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da ceremony on the twelfth day.\n\n35\\. Hence, having bathed, and having cleaned with cow-dung the place of\ndeath, the son should perform the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da ceremony, as laid down in the\nscriptures.\n\n36-30. Then he should worship the world-deities with foot-water, oblations, 1\nand \xc4\x81chamana. 2 Next, having given rice-balls to other departed ones, he\nshould sip water.\n\nHe should offer three rice-balls in order to his grandfather and others, in\nthe forms of Vasu, Rudra and Arka, and the fourth rice-ball to the dead.\n\nHe should worship with sandal-paste, leaves of the holy basil, incenses,\nlamps, agreeable fools, mouth-scents, good cloths and presents.\n\nHaving divided the rice-ball for the departed into three parts with a thin bar\nof gold, he should mix them severally with the three rice-balls given to the\ngrand father and the others.\n\np. 119\n\n40\\. It is my decision, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, that the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da ought to be done; the\nmother\'s with the grandmother\'s and the father\'s with the grandfather\'s.\n\n41-43. If the father dies while the grandfather still lives, three rice balls\nshould be offered to the great grandfather and his predecessors.\n\nThe father\'s rice-ball, divided into three parts should be mixed with their\nrice-balls. If the mother dies before the grandmother--\n\nThen he should perform the mother\'s \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha in the same way as the fathers; or\nshould mix the rice-ball with both mine and great Lak\xe1\xb9\xa3m\xc4\xab\'s.\n\n44\\. The husband should perform the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da ceremony for his, wife, if she has\nno son; he should do the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da for her along with the mother-in-law and\nothers.\n\n45\\. "The Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da rite for women should be done with that for the husband, his\nfather and grandfather"--that, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, is not my opinion; because the wife\nbeing already half the body of her husband requires no Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da ceremony with\nregard to her husband.\n\n46\\. If, O K\xc4\x81\xc5\x9byapa! husband and wife ascend the same funeral pyre, then,\nhaving put grasses between them, he should perform it with that of the mother-\nin-law and father-in-law.\n\n47\\. Only one son should perform the rites; first the offering of a rice-ball\nand other things for the father, and after that, having bathed again, the rite\nfor the mother.\n\np. 120\n\n 120-48\n\n49-51. Having done the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, he should make the offering of\nwater to the forefathers. He should utter "Let there be Swadh\xc4\x81," along with\nVaidic mantras.\n\nAfterwards he should always have a guest fed until he says "hanta." 1 By this\nthe forefathers, the sages, the Shining Ones and the D\xc4\x81navas are pleased.\n\nAs much as a mouthful is called "alms," four mouthfuls is "abundance," and\nfour abundances is called "hantak\xc4\x81ra."\n\n52-53. During the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da he should worship the feet of a twice-born with\nsandal-paste and coloured rice, and make to him a gift, for his continued\nsatisfaction.\n\nHe should have maintenance for a year, clarified butter, food, gold, silver, a\ngood cow, a horse, an elephant, a chariot and a plot of ground given to a\npreceptor.\n\n54\\. Then he should worship with mantras--after saying "Hail to thee"--the\nplanets, Devi, 2 and Vin\xc4\xabyakam 3, with saffron, coloured rice and eatables.\n\n55\\. The preceptor should then, with mantras, sprinkle water, and having bound\na thread upon the hand, should present the coloured rice also consecrated with\nmantras.\n\np. 121\n\n50-57. Then he should have Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s fed with various pleasant sweetened foods,\nand he should give them presents, and twelve pots with water and food.\n\nAfter the feeding of the twice-born, water, a weapon, scales, and a rod should\nbe touched severally by the castes, who are respectively thus purified.\n\n58\\. The Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da ceremony having been thus performed, the cloths worn during\nthe rite should be cast off; and white cloths having been donned, the gift of\na bed should he made.\n\n59-64. All the Dev\xc4\x81s, 1 headed by Indra, extol the gift of a bed. Therefore a\nbed should be given, during life or else after death.\n\nMade of the choicest wood, delightful, painted in beautiful colours, strong,\ncanopied with silken cloth, ornamented with gold leaves,\n\nHaving beautiful pillows stuffed with swans\' down, together with a coverlet\nmade fragrant with the scent of flowers,\n\nWell-bound with bright bands, broad and pleasant: such a bed as this being\nmade, it should be placed on the ground covered with cloth.\n\nAn umbrella, a row of silver lamps, an oxtail fan, a seat, a vessel, a water-\npot, a mirror, and a canopy of five colours,\n\np. 122\n\nAnd all the other accompaniments of the bed he should place round it, in their\nproper places.\n\n65-66. On it he should have placed a golden Hari, together with Lak\xe1\xb9\xa3m\xc4\xab, with\nall the ornaments, weapons and clothes.\n\nAnd, in the case of women, having placed them on the bed, he should have the\nred dye, saffron, clothes, ornaments, and all the other necessary things.\n\n67-68. Then a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87, with his wife adorned with fragrances and flowers, with\near and finger ornaments and golden necklaces,\n\nWearing a turban and an upper cloth and jacket, should be seated by him on the\ncomfortable bed, in front of Lak\xe1\xb9\xa3m\xc4\xab and N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\n69-71. He should worship Hari and Lak\xe1\xb9\xa3m\xc4\xab with saffron and flower-garlands, and\nadore the Guardians of the World, the Planetary Spirits and Vin\xc4\x81yaka.\n\nFacing north, and holding flowers in his palms, he should pronounce this\nmantra, standing in front of the Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87:\n\n"Just as, O K\xe1\xb9\x9bi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87a, your bed is the ocean full of milk, may this likewise be\nnot empty in my future births."\n\np. 123\n\n72-74. Thus he should place the handsful of flowers before the Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 and the\nimage of Hari, and then the bed-gift with its accompaniments, according to the\nrite.\n\nHe should give it to him who observes vows, is a teacher, and tells about\nBr\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87, and say, "O Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87, receive these. How seldom does any one so give!"\n\nHe should rock the twice-born and Lak\xe1\xb9\xa3m\xc4\xab and Hari, seated on the bed, and\nthen, having walked round and bowed, give them leave.\n\n75\\. If he is rich he should give a very beautiful house, furnished with all\nthe necessaries, so that he may sleep happily on the bed,\n\n76\\. If a living man makes with his own hand the gift of a bed, there should\nbe performed, while he is still living, on full moon day the dedication of a\nbull.\n\n77\\. This bed should be given to one only, and never to several. Divided or\nsold it drags down the giver.\n\n78\\. Having given a bed to a deserving person, he may obtain the fruit of his\ndesires. The father, and the son giving it, rejoices here and hereafter.\n\n79-80. At the celestial house of Indra, and at the abode of Yama, he will\narrive without doubt through the potency of the gift of a bed.\n\nHe will reside there free from trouble, seated in the best of chariots, waited\nupon by numbers of celestial damsels, until the coming of the deluge.\n\np. 124\n\n81\\. The merit from all the sacred bathing places, and on all the days of the\nchanges of the moon: even superior to these is the merit arising from the gift\nof a bed.\n\n82-86. Having this made the gift of a bed, the son should have _Padad \xc4\x81na_\ngiven. Listen to my words, and I will tell you the method of it.\n\nAn umbrella, shoes, clothes, a signet ring, a water-pot, a seat, a set of five\nvessels--are called the seven kinds of padas.\n\nThis pada becomes complete with a staff, a copper vessel, uncooked rice,\nfoods, [valuables](errata.htm#12), and sacred threads.\n\nHaving, according to his means, obtained these thirteen padas he should give,\nthem to thirteen Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s on the twelfth day.\n\nBy this _padad \xc4\x81na_ the righteous go to a good condition, and this _padad \xc4\x81na_\ngives happiness to those who have gone on the way of Yama.\n\np. 125\n\n87-93. There is there intense heat, by which the man is scorched, but the gift\nof an umbrella makes pleasant shade above his head;\n\nAnd on the path in the world of Yama, full of great thorns, those who gave\nshoes go riding horses.\n\nThe miseries of cold and heat and wind are dreadful there, O Bird, but by the\npower of the gift of clothes he goes happily along the way.\n\nThe messengers of Yama, very terrible, fierce and brown-black, do not trouble\non the road him who made the gift of a signet ring.\n\nIt is enveloped in great heat, is windless and without water; through the gift\nof a water pot he, when thirsty, drinks water.\n\nWho, for the dead, gives a water-vessel made of copper, certainly enjoys the\nfruit which is obtained by thousands of gifts of wells.\n\nThrough properly giving to a twice-born a seat and a vessel, leisurely going\non the path he comfortably enjoys his provisions,\n\n94-95. Having thus given, on the day of the Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da ceremony, this gift, as\nprescribed, he should have many Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s fed, also cha\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8dal\xc4\x81s and other\noutcasts.\n\nThen, after the _Sapinda_ and before the annual ceremony, a water-pot with\nrice-balls should be given every month.\n\n911\\. There is no re-doing of what is done excepting the rites for the\ndeparted, 1 O Bird; but, for the sake of the departed it may be done again, as\na means of unfading satisfaction.\n\n97-99. Now I shall tell you the rules concerning the monthly, the annual and\nthe fortnightly ceremonies, and of dying on lunar days.\n\np. 126\n\nIf one dies at the full moon his rites fall on the fourth day. If one dies on\nthe fourth day his rites fall on the ninth.\n\nIf one dies on the ninth day, his day is the fourteenth. In these cases one\nshould perform the fortnightly \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha on the twentieth day.\n\n100-105. When in one month [K\xe1\xb9\xa3ayam\xc4\x81sa] two sa\xe1\xb9\x85kr\xc4\x81ntis occur, in the irregular\nmonth, the month being double, the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha is not performed. 1\n\nWhen there are two months in one month, of those two, the two fortnights and\nthe thirty days are the same [both must be performed.] For the first half day\ntake the former [the dark]; for the second half,\n\np. 127\n\nthe latter. Thus are understood by the wise the two months which are in the\nirregular month.\n\nThe Sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da ceremony, O bird, should be done when there is no sankr\xc4\x81nta;\nsimilarly the monthly and the first annual \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddhas.\n\nIf there is an additional month in the middle of a year, then in the\nthirteenth month the annual ceremony for the departed occurs.\n\nWhen there is no [sankr\xc4\x81nta](errata.htm#15), rice-balls are not used; when\nthere is sankr\xc4\x81nta, rice-balls are proper. Thus the annual \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha should be\ndone in both months.\n\n106\\. Thus, at the end of the first year one should perform the annual\n\xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha, and in that, in addition, the twice-born should be fed.\n\n107-110. After a year one should always offer three rice-balls at the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha.\nThe ceremony for one only should not be done; by it one becomes the destroyer\nof his forefathers.\n\nThe \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha at a sacred bathing-place, the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha at Gaya, the Gajachchh\xc4\x81yam,\nfor the fathers--these he should not do during the year, nor at eclipses, nor\non yuga days.\n\nIf the son performs the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha at Gay\xc4\x81, O Lord of Birds, it should be done\nafter a year, with devotion to the forefathers.\n\nThe forefathers are freed from the ocean of existence by the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha at Gay\xc4\x81\nand, by favour of the Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, they go to the supreme state.\n\np. 128\n\n111-113. He should worship the feet of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u with the shoots of the holy\nbasil, and in proper order offer rice-balls round them.\n\nHe who offers, on the head of Gay\xc4\x81, a rice-ball of the size of even a \xc5\x9bam\xc4\xab\nleaf helps over seven clans and one hundred and one fatuities.\n\nHe who, delighting the family, having gone to Gay\xc4\x81, performs the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha and\ngives satisfaction to the forefathers, his life is fruitful.\n\n111-115. O Lord of birds, the forefathers hear a song sung by the Holy Ones in\nKal\xc4\x81pa, the garden of Ik\xe1\xb9\xa3v\xc4\x81ku, the son of Manu:--\n\n"Are there none in your family, treading the good path, who, having gone to\nGay\xc4\x81, will offer us rice-balls, with devotion?"\n\n116-119. The son who thus performs the rites for the other world, O T\xc4\x81rkshya,\nis happy and becomes liberated, like the son of Kau\xc5\x9bika.\n\nThe seven sons of Bharadw\xc4\x81ja, having experienced a series of births, were\nliberated by the favour of the forefathers, O T\xc4\x81rkshya, although they killed a\ncow.\n\nThe seven hunters in the country of Da\xc5\x9b\xc4\x81r\xe1\xb9\x87as; the deer on the mountain of\nK\xc4\x81linjira; the Chakravaka birds in \xc5\x9aaradv\xc4\xabpa: and the swans in the M\xc4\x81nasa lake\n\nWere born as Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s learned in the Vedas, on the field of the Kurus, and all\nthese sons of the twice-born attained liberation through devotion to the\nforefathers.\n\np. 129\n\n120\\. Therefore a man should make every effort in devotion to the forefathers,\nfor by devotion to the forefathers he becomes happy either in this or the\nother world.\n\n121\\. Thus I have told you, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, all the ceremonies, concerning the\ndeceased, giving merit to and satisfying the desires of the son, and giving\nliberation to the forefathers.\n\n122\\. Any man who is poor, but hears this account, even he, absolved from\nsins, obtains the fruit of gifts.\n\n123-126. He who performs, according to the rite, the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha offerings\ndescribed by me, and also hears the Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a,--listen to the fruit for\nhim:--\n\nThe father gives good sons; the grandfather, wealth of cows and his [great-\ngrandfather](errata.htm#16) becomes the giver of riches.\n\nThe great-great-grandfather gives foods in abundance: all these, gratified by\nthe \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha, granting the son\'s desires,\n\nGo on the way of righteousness to the mansion of the King of Justice, and\nthere they remain, highly respected, in the assembly of Righteousness.\n\n127\\. S\xc5\xabta said: Having heard the result of the after-death gifts and their\nmighty greatness, thus declared by the Blessed Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da went into\nraptures.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[114:1](gpu15.htm#fr_131) The grandfather, his father and grandfather are\nconsidered as corresponding to Vasu, Rudra and \xc4\x80ditya.

Hence there is an\nintercalary month of 30 days every three years. The sankr\xc4\x81nta is a solar\nmonth, the passing of the sun through one [zodiacal](errata.htm#13)\nconstellation. The difference of solar and lunar months is about 11 days in\nthe year; hence an additional irregular month occurs once in 27 months. In\nthis long month; the malamasa, or irregular portion, is the first half, while\nthe second half is regular. The k\xe1\xb9\xa3aya-m\xc4\x81sa is a name for a month which occurs\nevery 149th year, in which there is no sankr\xc4\x81nti,--thus there are only 12\nmonths in that year, not 13, although it is a year of intercalary month. In\nthis case the intercalary is added [and (?)](errata.htm#14) treated as such,\nbut the regular mouth is dropped. It is November, December, January or\nFebruary which is thus dropped, but the intercalary is always associated with\none of the other eight. The month preceding month which is dropped has its two\nfortnights taken as belonging to the regular and the dropped month\nrespectively. If a man dies in the second fortnight in this case the annual\nceremony belongs to the month which was dropped. lf, on the other hand, a main\nhas died and his month is dropped the preceding month is taken for the annual\n\xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha. If a man dies in the adigm\xc4\x81sa, then his annual \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha must be done\nin the dark half on the same day on which he died; if his death occurred\nduring the first half of the day, and on the same day in the bright half if he\ndied during the second half of the day.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIV.
