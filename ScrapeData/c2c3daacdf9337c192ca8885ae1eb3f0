He then puts down a (living) tortoise;--the tortoise means life-\nsap: it is life-sap (blood) he thus bestows on (Agni). This tortoise is that\nlife-sap of these worlds which flowed away from them when plunged into the\nwaters 1: that (life-sap) he now bestows on (Agni). As far as the life-sap\nextends, so far the body extends: that (tortoise) thus is these worlds.\n\n7:5:1:22\\. That lower shell of it is this (terrestrial) world; it is, as it\nwere, fixed; for fixed, as it were, is this (earth-)world. And that upper\nshell of it is yonder sky; it has its ends, as it were, bent down; for yonder\nsky has its ends, as it were, bent down. And what is between (the shells) is\nthe air;--that (tortoise) thus is these worlds: it is these worlds he thus\nlays down (to form part of the altar).\n\n7:5:1:33\\. He anoints it with sour curds, honey, and ghee,--sour curds\ndoubtless are a form of this (earth-)world,\n\np. 390\n\nghee of the air, and honey of yonder sky: he thus supplies it (the tortoise)\nwith its own form. Or, sour curds are the life-sap of this (earth-)world, ghee\nthat of the air, and honey that of yonder sky: he thus supplies it with its\nown life-sap.\n\n7:5:1:44\\. [He anoints it, with Va _g_. S. XIII, 27-29; _Ri_ k S. I, 90, 6-8]\n\'Honey the winds pour forth for the righteous, honey the rivers; full of honey\nmay the plants be for us!--Honey by night and morn, rich in honey may the\nregion of the earth be for us, honey the father Heaven!--rich in honey may the\ntree be for us, rich in honey the sun, full of honey the kine!\' To whatever\ndeity a Rik-verse, and to whatever (deity) a Ya _g_ us formula applies, that\nvery deity the verse is, and that very deity the sacrificial formula is 1.\nThis triplet then is honey (madhu); and honey being life-sap, it is life-sap\nhe thus puts into him (Agni). With three Gayatri verses (he performs): the\nsignificance of this has been explained.\n\n7:5:1:55\\. And as to its being called \'kurma\' (tortoise);Pra _g_ apati, having\nassumed that form, created living beings. Now what he created, he made; and\ninasmuch as he made (kar), he is (called) \'kurma;\' and \'kurma\' being (the same\nas) \'ka _s_ yapa\' (a tortoise), therefore all creatures are said to be\ndescended from Ka _s_ yapa.\n\n7:5:1:66\\. Now this tortoise is the same as yonder sun: it is yonder sun he\nthus lays down (on the altar). He lays it down in front with the head towards\nthe back (west): he thus places yonder sun in the east\n\np. 391\n\nlooking thitherwards (or moving westward); and hence yonder sun is placed in\nthe east looking thitherwards. On the right (south) of the Asha _dh_ a (he\nplaces it), for the tortoise (kurma, masc.) is a male, and the Asha _dh_ a a\nfemale, and the male lies on the right side of the female;--at a cubit\'s\ndistance 1, for at a cubit\'s distance the male lies by the female. That Asha\n_dh_ a is the consecrated queen (mahishi) of all the bricks, hence being on\nthe right (south) side of her, it (the tortoise) is on the right side of all\nthe bricks.\n\n7:5:1:77\\. And, again, why he puts down a tortoise;--the tortoise (kurma) is\nthe breath, for the breath makes (kar) all these creatures: it is breath he\nthus puts into him (Agni). He puts it down in front looking towards the back:\nhe thus puts in the breath in front tending towards the back; whence the\nbreath is taken in from the front backwards. [He puts it down so as to be]\nturned towards the (gold) man: he thus puts breath into the Sacrificer. South\nof the Asha _dh_ a (he puts it), for the tortoise is breath, and the Asha _dh_\na speech; and the breath (pra _n_ a, masc.) is the male, the mate, of speech\n(va _k_ , fem.).\n\n7:5:1:88\\. [He sets it down, with Va _g_. S. XIII, 30-32] Seat thee in the\ndepth of the waters for that indeed is the deepest (place) of the (heavenly)\nwaters where yonder (sun) burns;--\'lest the sun, lest Agni Vai _s_ vanara\nshould scorch thee!\' that is, lest the Sun, lest Agni Vai _s_ vanara injure\nthee;--\'Overlook the creatures with unbroken wings,\' that is, overlook all\nthese uninjured, unharmed creatures, that is, these bricks;--\'may\n\np. 392\n\nheaven\'s rain favour thee!\' this he says in order that the rain of heaven may\nfavour him.\n\n7:5:1:99\\. He then makes it move 1, with, \'Over the heaven-reaching three\noceans he crept,\' the three heaven-reaching oceans doubtless are these worlds,\nand over them he crept in the shape of a tortoise;--\'the lord of waters, the\nbull of the bricks,\' for he (the tortoise) indeed is the lord of waters, and\nthe bull of the bricks;--\'induing the covering of him, the well-made, in the\nworld,\' the covering (purisha) means the cattle: thus, entering the (form of\nthe) cattle of the well-made (Agni) in the world;--\'go thither whither the\nformer have passed away!\' that is, go thither whither by this performance\nformer (tortoises) went.\n\n7:5:1:1010\\. \'The mighty sky and the earth,\' that is, the great sky and the\nearth;--\'shall mix (prepare) this our sacrifice!\' that is, shall favour this\nsacrifice;--\'they shall fill us with nourishments!\' that is, they shall\nnourish us with nourishments! With the last (verse) relating to heaven and\nearth he puts it down, for the tortoise represents heaven and earth.\n\n7:5:1:1111\\. With three (formulas) he puts it on (the altar);--three are these\nworlds, and threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, by so much he thus puts it on. With three (formulas) he anoints it;\nthat makes six: the significance of this (number) has been explained. There\nare avaka-plants 2 below and avaka-plants above (the\n\np. 393\n\ntortoise),--the avaka-plant means water: he thus places it in the midst of\nwater. Having \'settled\' it, he pronounces the Sudadohas upon it: the\nsignificance of this has been explained.\n\n7:5:1:1212\\. He then puts down a mortar and pestle. Vish _n_ u desired, \'May I\nbe an eater of food!\' He saw these two bricks, the mortar and pestle. He\nplaced them on (the altar); and by placing them thereon, he became an eater of\nfood. In like manner, when the Sacrificer now places a mortar and pestle\nthereon, (he does so) thinking, \'I want to be an eater of food by the same\nmeans (rupa), by performing the same rite by which Vish _n_ u became an eater\nof food.\' Now the mortar and pestle mean all (kinds of) food; for by the\nmortar and pestle food is prepared, and by means of them it is eaten.\n\n7:5:1:1313\\. He puts them down at the distance of the two reta _h_ si _k_  1,\n--the reta _h_ si _k_ being the ribs, and the ribs being the middle: he thus\nputs food into the middle of him (Agni);--on the north (upper) side (of the\ncentral brick): he thus puts the food upon him;--at the distance of a cubit,\nfor from a cubit\'s distance food is (taken by the hand and) eaten.\n\n7:5:1:1414\\. They measure a span, for Vish _n_ u, when an embryo, was a span\nlong; and these (mortar and pestle) being food, he thus puts food into him\n(Agni-Vish _n_ u) proportionate to his body. And indeed the food which is\nproportionate to the body satisfies,\n\np. 394\n\nand does no harm; but that which is excessive does harm; and that which is too\nlittle does not satisfy.\n\n7:5:1:1515\\. They are made of Udumbara wood;--the Udumbara (ficus glomerata)\nbeing strength, life-sap, he thus puts strength, life-sap into him. And,\nagain, the Udumbara being all the trees, by putting on those two, he puts all\ntrees on (the altar). At the distance of the two reta _h_ si _k_ (bricks, he\nplaces the mortar and pestle),--the \'seed-shedders\' being these two (worlds\n1), he thus puts the trees in these two (worlds), and hence there are trees in\nthese two (worlds). It (the mortar) is four-cornered,--there being four\nquarters, he thus places trees in all the quarters; whence there are trees in\nall the quarters. It is contracted in the middle, to give it the form of a\n(real) mortar.\n\n7:5:1:1616\\. And, again, why he places a mortar and pestle thereon. From Pra\n_g_ apati, when relaxed, the breath wanted to go out from within. He kept it\nback by means of food: hence the breath is kept back by food, for he who eats\nfood, breathes.\n\n7:5:1:1717\\. The breath being kept back, the food wanted to go out of him. He\nkept it back by means of the breath: hence food is kept back by the breath,\nfor he who breathes, eats food.\n\n7:5:1:1818\\. Those two being kept back, strength wanted to go out of him. He\nkept it back by those two: hence strength is kept back by those two; for he\nwho eats food, breathes; and to him it gives strength.\n\n7:5:1:1919\\. Strength being kept back, those two wanted\n\np. 395\n\nto go out of him. He kept them back by means of strength: hence those two are\nkept back by strength; for he to whom one gives strength, breathes and eats\nfood.\n\n7:5:1:2020\\. Those (energies) thus were kept back by one another. Having kept\nthem back by one another, he (Pra _g_ apati) caused them to enter his own\nself; and that food having entered, all the gods entered along with it; for\neverything here lives on food.\n\n7:5:1:2121\\. It is thereto that this verse applies,--\'Then, indeed, he became\nthat breath,\'--for that breath he then indeed became;--\'having become the\ngreat Pra _g_ apati,\'--for great he indeed then became, when those gods\nentered him;--\'having obtained the benefits, the beneficial,\'--the benefits\ndoubtless are the vital airs (breaths), and the beneficial are the food: thus,\nhaving obtained all that;--\'when he breathed the breaths in the stronghold;\'--\nthe stronghold doubtless is the self (body), and inasmuch as he breathed the\nbreaths, the gods are the breaths; and inasmuch as Pra _g_ apati breathed, the\nbreath also is Pra _g_ apati; and verily he who is that breath, he is that\nGayatri;--and as to that food, that is Vish _n_ u, the deity; and as to that\nstrength, that is the Udumbara (tree).\n\n7:5:1:2222\\. He said, \'Verily this one has lifted me from out of all evil;\'\nand because he said he has lifted me out (udabharshit),\' hence (the name)\n\'udumbhara;\'--\'udumbhara\' doubtless being what is mystically called Udumbara,\nfor the gods love the mystic. \'Wide space (uru) shall it make (karat) for me!\'\nhe said, hence \'urukara;\' \'urukara\' doubtless being what is mystically called\n\'ulukhala\' (the mortar); for the gods love the mystic. Now that mortar is\n\np. 396\n\nthe birth-place of all breaths; and the birth-place of the breaths being the\nhead-\n\n7:5:1:2323\\. It (the mortar) is of the measure of a span, for the head is, as\nit were, of the measure of a span;--four-cornered, for the head is, as it\nwere, four-cornered;--contracted in the middle, for the head is, as it were,\ncontracted in the middle.\n\n7:5:1:2424\\. Now when the gods restored him (Pra _g_ apati-Agni), they put all\nthat inside him--breath, food, strength; and in like manner this (Sacrificer)\nnow puts that into him. At the distance of the two reta _h_ si _k_ (he places\nit),--the reta _h_ si _k_ being the ribs, and the ribs the middle, it is thus\nin the middle of (or, inside) him that he puts all that.\n\n7:5:1:2525\\. [He sets them down 1, with Va _g_. S. XIII, 33; _Ri_ k S. I, 22,\n191 \'See ye the deeds of Vish _n_ u\'--deed doubtless means power: thus, see ye\nthe powers of Vish _n_ u;--\'whereby he beheld the sacred ordinances,\'--\nordinance means food: thus, whereby he did behold the food;--\'Indra\'s allied\nfriend,\' for he is indeed Indra\'s allied friend. With a (verse) relating to\ntwo deities he sets them down, for the mortar and pestle are two. Once he\n\'settles\' them: he thereby makes them one and the same; for one and the same\nis that food. Having \'settled\' it, he pronounces the Sudadohas on it: the\nsignificance of this has been explained.\n\n7:5:1:2626\\. He then places the fire-pan thereon,--the fire-pan is a womb: a\nwomb (birth-place) he thus gives to him (Agni). He places it on the mortar,--\nthe mortar is the air, and everything that is above this\n\np. 397\n\nearth is air; and the air is the middle: he thus places the womb in the\nmiddle; whence the womb of all beings, even of trees 1, is in the middle.\n\n7:5:1:2727\\. And, again, why he places the fire-pan thereon;--that same Pra\n_g_ apati who became disjointed doubtless is this same fire-pan, for the fire-\npan is these worlds, and Pra _g_ apati is these worlds. He places it on the\nmortar: he thereby establishes him (Pra _g_ apati) in all that--breath, food,\nstrength; and thus he places him se as not to be separated from all that.\n\n7:5:1:2828\\. Thereupon, having pounded the remainder (of the clay), and having\nput the fire-pan in its place, he throws (the pounded clay) in front of the\nfire-pan; for this is the place of that (remainder 2), and thus that\n(remainder) is not separated therefrom 3.\n\np. 398\n\n7:5:1:2929\\. Here now they say, \'How does that (remainder) of his come to be\nput on as cooked, as baked?\'--In that it is prepared with a sacrificial\nformula; and, moreover, whatever comes in contact with Agni Vai _s_ vanara\neven thereby comes to be put on as something cooked, as baked.\n\n7:5:1:3030\\. [He sets the fire-pan down, with Va _g_. S. XIII, 34-35] \'Steady\nthou art, supporting,\' the meaning of this has been explained 1;--\'from here\nhe was at first born, from these wombs, the knower of beings;\' for from these\nwombs the knower of beings (Agni) was indeed born at first;--\'by the Gayatri,\nthe Trish _t_ ubh, and the Anush _t_ ubh, may he, the knowing, bear the\noffering to the gods!\'--by means of these metres he, the knowing, indeed bears\nthe offering to the gods.\n\n7:5:1:3131\\. \'For sap, for wealth, do thou rest, for might in glory, for\nstrength, for offspring!\' that is, for all that do thou rest!--\'all-ruling\nthou art, self-ruling thou art!\' for both all-ruling and self-ruling he (Agni)\nindeed is;--\'may the two Sarasvata wells cheer thee!\' Sarasvat (m.) is the\nMind, and Sarasvati (f.) Speech,--these two are the Sarasvata wells: thus, may\nthese two cheer thee! With two (formulas) he sets it down: the significance of\nthis has been explained; and, moreover, twofold is that form, (consisting as\nit does of) clay and water. Having \'settled\' it, he pronounces the Sudadohas\non it: the significance of this has been explained.\n\n7:5:1:3232\\. He then offers upon it;--now seed was poured into it before, (in\nthe shape of) sand 2; that he now\n\np. 399\n\nfashions 1, whence the seed injected into the womb is fashioned. He offers\nwith the dipping-spoon, with \'Hail!\' with two Gayatri verses relating to Agni:\nthe significance of this has been explained.\n\n7:5:1:3333\\. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 36-37; _Ri_ k S. VI, 16, 43 VIII, 75,1] \'O\nAgni, harness those good steeds of thine: they draw equal to thy mettle!--Like\na chariot-fighter, harness thou the steeds, the best callers of the gods, O\nAgni! take thy seat as the old Hot _ri_!\' with two (verses) containing the\n(verb) \'yu _g_ \' (to harness, fasten),--he thus settles that seed injected\ninto the womb, whence the seed settled in the womb does not escape.\n\n7:5:1:3434\\. If (the fire in the pan) has been carried about for a year 2, in\nthat case he should now offer; for (the fire) which has been carried about for\na year is everything, and that also whereon he offers is everything. But if it\nhas not been carried about for a year, let him only stand by (worshipping) it;\nfor (the fire) which has not been carried about for a year is not everything;\nand that by which he stands (worshipping) is not everything. Let him\nnevertheless offer thereon.\n\n7:5:1:3535\\. Now that Agni is an animal, and even now he is (being) made up\nwhole and complete: the naturally-perforated (brick) is his lower vital air,\nthe\n\np. 400\n\ndviya _g_ us the hip, the two reta _h_ si _k_ the ribs, the vi _s_ va _g_\nyotis the breast-bone, the two seasonal ones the back, the asha _dh_ a the\nneck, the tortoise the head, and the vital airs in the tortoise are those\nvital airs in the head.\n\n7:5:1:3636\\. Now that (Agni) he builds upwards from here (as flying) towards\nthe east, and that Agni being yonder sun, he thereby places yonder sun upwards\nfrom here in the east; whence yonder sun is placed upwards from here in the\neast.\n\n7:5:1:3737\\. He then turns him towards the right 1,--he thereby turns yonder\nsun towards the right, whence yonder sun moves round these worlds (from left)\nto right.\n\n7:5:1:3838\\. The fire-pan is the belly, the mortar the womb;--the fire-pan is\nabove, and the mortar below; for the belly is above, and the womb below. The\npestle is the _s_ i _s_ na; it is round-like, for the _s_ i _s_ na is round-\nlike. He places it to the right (south of the mortar), for the male lies on\nthe right side of the female. And what food there is for the consecrated\nanimal, that is the durva-brick. The left (north) side of that (Agni or altar)\nis more raised,--that Agni is an animal, and hence the left side of the belly\nof a well-filled beast is more raised (than the right side).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[389:1](sbe4165.htm#fr_723) See [VI, 1, 1, 12](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:12).\n\n[390:1](sbe4165.htm#fr_724) That is to say, each Vedic text is identical with\nthe deity to which it is addressed.

This distance is ascertained by means\nof a cord stretched across the bricks hitherto laid down (from the Svayamat\n_ri_ _n_ _n_ a to the Asha _dh_ a), and knots made in the cord over the centre\nof the respective bricks.\n\n[394:1](sbe4165.htm#fr_729) I do not see what else could here be referred to\nthan the heaven and the earth (cf. [VII, 4, 2, 22](sbe4164.htm#7:4:2:22)),\nthough in that case one might rather expect \'imau (lokau)\' instead of \'ime.\'\nPossibly, however, the earth and atmosphere may be intended.\n\n[396:1](sbe4165.htm#fr_730) The mortar, according to the commentaries to\nKaty., is partly dug into the ground, with the open part upwards; the pestle\nbeing then placed to the right (south) of it.\n\n[397:1](sbe4165.htm#fr_731) Viz., according to Saya _n_ a, because they spring\nfrom the germ in the centre of the fruit.\n\n[397:2](sbe4165.htm#fr_732) ? Or, of it (the fire-pan). There is some\nuncertainty regarding this item of the ceremonial. Katyayana\'s rule (XVII, 5,\n4)--\'Having placed the Ukha (pan) on the mortar, pounded the remainder of\nclay, and thrown it down in front, with the text "Dhruva asi," (of) the Ukha\'\n--is evidently intentionally vague. Mahidhara (on Va _g_. S. XIII, 34) gives\nthe following interpretation of it,--\'Having first silently placed the Ukha on\nthe mortar, then pounded the remaining clay, and thrown it down on the ground\nin front of the Ukha, let him place the Ukha thereon with two formulas.\'\nAccording to this, the Ukha would only temporarily be placed on the mortar,\nits proper and permanent place (loka) being on the powdered clay in front (to\nthe east) of the mortar. The text of the Brahma _n_ a, as it stands, however,\ncannot possibly be construed so as to accord with Mahidhara\'s interpretation.\nThis would require some such reading as,--athopa _s_ ayam pish _t_ va,\npurastad ukhaya upanivapya lokabha _g_ am ukham karoti. See, however,\nparagraph [38](sbe4165.htm#7:5:1:38) below, which evidently applies to the\npermanent position of the pan.\n\n[397:3](sbe4165.htm#fr_733) For the genitive \'asya\' (viz. lokasya) with\n\'antarita\'--instead p. 398 of the more usual ablative--see [VI, 2, 2,\n38](sbe4132.htm#6:2:2:38), \'pra _n_ asya tad antariyat.\'\n\n[398:1](sbe4165.htm#fr_734) [VII. 4, 2, 5](sbe4164.htm#7:4:2:5).\n\n[398:2](sbe4165.htm#fr_735) See [VII, 1, 1, 41](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:41).\n\n[399:1](sbe4165.htm#fr_736) The verb \'abhi-k _ri_ \' is here taken in the sense\nof \'vi-k _ri_ \' (he gives form to it); and in that sense I would now take it\nat II, 3; I, 4, \'he fashions (gives human shape to) that embryo,\' instead of\n\'he benefits that embryo.\' The St. Petersburg dictionary proposes the meaning,\n\'to do something with reference to (or, for the benefit of).\' The proper\nGerman meaning would rather seem to be \'bearbeiten.\' The preposition \'abhi\' is\nprobably used here with reference to the \'abhi- _g_ uhoti.\'\n\n[399:2](sbe4165.htm#fr_737) See [p. 269](sbe4149.htm#page_269), note\n[3](sbe4149.htm#fn_510).\n\n[400:1](sbe4165.htm#fr_738) ?
