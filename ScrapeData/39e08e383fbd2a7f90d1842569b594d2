Log by log [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:1:1) be kind towards us. Flash by flash\ngrant us thy, the Vasu's, favour [2](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:1:2). Bring hither, O\ngod, the gods that we may sacrifice. Sacrifice, O Agni, as a kind friend to\nthy friends.\n\n2\\. Thou whom the gods, Varu _n_ a, Mitra, Agni, thrice every day bring hither\nby sacrifice day by day, Tanunapat, make this our sacrifice honey-sweet,\nhaving its abode in ghee [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:2:1), (this sacrifice) which\nworships (the gods).\n\n3\\. (Our adoring) thought rich in all boons goes forward for worshipping as\nthe first the Hot _ri_ of the sacred food (i _l_ ), for saluting the strong\nbull with adoration and homage. May he, the best sacrificer, incited (by our\nprayers) sacrifice to the gods [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:3:1).\n\n4\\. Upwards your [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:4:1) course has been directed at the\nworship; upwards (your) flames [2](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:4:2) are gone; ready\n(for receiving you) is the air [3](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:4:3). Or the Hot _ri_\nhas sat down at heaven's navel. We spread out the sacrificial grass which\nreceives the gods.\n\n5 [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:1). Choosing in their mind the sevenfold work of\nthe Hot _ri_ s [2](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:2), enlivening everything (the gods)\ncame hither in the right way. (The divine doors [3](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:3))\nwith men as their ornaments [4](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:4), born at the\nsacrifices [5](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:5), have come hither and thither to this\nsacrifice, many of them.\n\n6\\. Hither (shall come) the two Dawns [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:6:1), the\nneighbourly (goddesses) of glorious appearance [2](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:6:2).\n\np. 237\n\n[paragraph continues] Of different forms, they both smile. (They shall come)\nthat Mitra and Varu _n_ a may be satisfied with us, and Indra accompanied by\nthe Maruts with their powers [3](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:6:3).\n\n7\\. I catch hold of the two divine Hot _ri_ s first. The seven strong ones\n[1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:7:1) rejoice according to their wont. Teaching the\nright, they proclaim the right, the guardians of law, contemplating the law.\n\n8 [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:8:1). May Bharati, in concord with the Bharatis, I\n_l_ a with the gods, Agni with men, Sarasvati with all (beings) belonging to\nSarasvati (come) hither; may the three goddesses sit down on this sacrificial\ngrass.\n\n9\\. O divine Tvash _t_ _ri_ , grant us and send forth this our seed which is\nto thrive: (the seed) from which a manly son is born able and skilful, who\nsets to work the press-stones, loving the gods.\n\n10\\. O tree [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:10:1), send (the offering) forth to the\ngods. May Agni the slaughterer make the offering ready. May the same, the very\ntrue Hot _ri_ , sacrifice according as he knows the generations of the gods.\n\n11\\. Agni, being kindled, come hither, on one chariot with Indra, with the\nquick gods. May Aditi, the mother of noble sons, sit down on our sacrificial\ngrass. With Svaha may the immortal gods rejoice.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 9 = TS. III, 1, 11, 1; MS. IV,\n13, 10. Verse 10 = VS. XXVII, 21; TS. IV, 1, 8, 3; MS. II, 12, 6.\n\np. 238\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Agni is invoked as personified in each log of fuel which is put on the\nsacrificial fire.\n\nNote 2. Comp. VII, 39, 1. sumatim vasva _h_.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. II, 3, 11. gh _ri_ tam asya yoni _h_.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Comp. X, 110, 3. sa _h_ enan yakshi ishita _h_ ya _g_ iyan (cf. also\nX, 110, 9).\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The text has the dual vam. But who are the two beings addressed?\nAccording to Saya _n_ a, Agni and the Barhis, which does not seem very\nprobable. The structure of the phrase gives the impression--though this\nimpression is by no means certain--that vam, which belongs to gatu, is to be\nsupplied to so _k_ i\xc2\xb4 _m_ shi also. If we are right in this supposition, are\nnot the two beings in question the two first of the three sacred fires, the\n\xc3\x82havaniya and Garhapatya? These two fires are frequently spoken of in the\nritual texts as of a dyad, with the omission of the third fire.--Prof. Max\nMuller proposes to change vam into va. According to him the meaning may be:\nEither the road has been made upward, i. e. the flames have gone upward to the\nsky, or Agni has sat down at heaven's navel.\n\nNote 2. Comp. VII, 43, 2. urdhva\xc2\xb4 _s_ o _k_ i\xc2\xb4 _m_ shi devayu\xc2\xb4ni asthu _h_.\n\nNote 3. Possibly the words urdhva\xc2\xb4 _s_ o _k_ i\xc2\xb4 _m_ shi prasthita ra _g_ a _m_\nsi may form one clause, 'upwards (your) flames are gone towards the sky.' M.\nM.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On this verse, comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 115 seq.\n\nNote 2. On the seven priests of the ancient Soma sacrifice, comp. H. O.,\nReligion des Veda, 383 seq.\n\np. 239\n\nNote 3. That this subject is to be supplied, is shown by the regular\ncomposition of the \xc3\x82pri hymns. It is confirmed by the word purvi\xc2\xb4 _h_ , which\nis evidently an epithet of the divine doors; comp. I, 188, 5; VII, 2, 5.\n\nNote 4. 'In human form.' M. M.\n\nNote 5. The text has vidatheshu.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. I. e. Night and Dawn.\n\nNote 2. Comp. above, I, 142, 7.\n\nNote 3. Comp. M. M., vol. xxxii, p. 196 seq.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, I, 127, 5, note 1. Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 96) may\nbe right in taking the seven p _ri_ ksha\xc2\xb4sa _h_ as the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, the sapta\nvipra _h_.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The verses 8-11 are repeated in VII, 2, 8-11.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. The tree is the sacrificial post (yupa).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 5](sbe46065.htm)\n\n"
