That which possesses the attributes of invisibility and so on (is\nBrahman), on account of the declaration of attributes.\n\nScripture says, 'The higher knowledge is this by which the Indestructible is\napprehended. That which cannot be seen nor seized, which is without origin and\nqualities, without eyes and ears, without hands and feet, the eternal, all-\npervading, omnipresent, infinitesimal, that which is imperishable, that it is\nwhich the wise regard as the source of all beings' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5; 6).--Here\nthe doubt arises whether the source of all beings which is spoken of as\ncharacterised by invisibility, &c. be the pradhana, or the embodied soul, or\nthe highest Lord.\n\nWe must, the purvapakshin says, understand by the source of all beings the\nnon-intelligent pradhana because (in the passage immediately subsequent to the\none quoted) only non-intelligent beings are mentioned as parallel instances.\n'As the spider sends forth and draws in its thread, as plants grow on the\nearth, as from the living man hairs spring forth on the head and the body,\nthus everything arises here from the Indestructible.--But, it\n\np. 136\n\nmay be objected, men and spiders which are here quoted as parallel instances\nare of intelligent nature.--No, the purvapakshin replies; for the intelligent\nbeing as such is not the source of the threads and the hair, but everybody\nknows that the non-intelligent body of the spider ruled by intelligence is the\nsource of the threads; and so in the case of man also.--While, moreover, in\nthe case of the preceding Sutra, the pradhana hypothesis could not be\naccepted, because, although some qualities mentioned, such as invisibility and\nso on, agreed with it, others such as being the seer and the like did not; we\nhave here to do only with attributes such as invisibility which agree with the\npradhana, no attribute of a contrary nature being mentioned.--But the\nqualities mentioned in the complementary passage (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9), 'He who\nknows all and perceives all,' do not agree with the non-intelligent pradhana;\nhow, then, can the source of all beings be interpreted to mean the pradhana?--\nTo this the purvapakshin replies: The passage, 'The higher knowledge is that\nby which the Indestructible is apprehended, that which cannot be seen,' &c.,\npoints, by means of the term 'the Indestructible,' to the source of all beings\ncharacterised by invisibility and similar attributes. This same\n'Indestructible' is again mentioned later on in the passage, 'It is higher\nthan the high Imperishable.' Now that which in this latter passage is spoken\nof as higher than the Imperishable may possess the qualities of knowing and\nperceiving everything, while the pradhana denoted by the term 'the\nImperishable' is the source of all beings.--If, however, the word 'source'\n(yoni) be taken in the sense of operative cause, we may by 'the source of the\nbeings' understand the embodied Self also, which, by means of merit and\ndemerit, is the cause of the origin of the complex of things.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--That which here is spoken of as the\nsource of all beings, distinguished by such qualities as invisibility and so\non, can be the highest Lord only, nothing else.--Whereupon is this conclusion\nfounded?--On the statement of attributes. For the clause, 'He who is all-\nknowing, all-perceiving,' clearly states an\n\np. 137\n\nattribute belonging to the highest Lord only, since the attributes of knowing\nall and perceiving all cannot be predicated either of the non-intelligent\npradhana or the embodied soul whose power of sight is narrowed by its limiting\nconditions. To the objection that the qualities of knowing and perceiving all\nare, in the passage under discussion, attributed to that which is higher than\nthe source of all beings--which latter is denoted by the term 'the\nImperishable'--not to the source itself, we reply that this explanation is\ninadmissible because the source of all beings, which--in the clause, 'From the\nIndestructible everything here arises'--is designated as the material cause of\nall created beings, is later on spoken of as all-knowing, and again as the\ncause of all created beings, viz. in the passage (I, 1, 9), 'From him who\nknows all and perceives all, whose brooding consists of knowledge, from him is\nborn that Brahman, name, form, and food.' As therefore the Indestructible\nwhich forms the general topic of discussion is, owing to the identity of\ndesignation, recognised (as being referred to in the later passage also), we\nunderstand that it is the same Indestructible to which the attributes of\nknowing and perceiving all are ascribed.--We further maintain that also the\npassage, 'Higher than the high Imperishable,' does not refer to any being\ndifferent from the imperishable source of all beings which is the general\ntopic of discussion. We conclude this from the circumstance that the passage,\n'He truly told that knowledge of Brahman through which he knows the\nimperishable true person,' (I, 2, 13; which passage leads on to the passage\nabout that which is higher than the Imperishable,) merely declares that the\nimperishable source of all beings, distinguished by invisibility and the like\n--which formed the subject of the preceding chapter--will be discussed. The\nreason why that imperishable source is called higher than the high\nImperishable, we shall explain under the next Sutra.--Moreover, two kinds of\nknowledge are enjoined there (in the Upanishad), a lower and a higher one. Of\nthe lower one it is said that it comprises the _Ri_ g-veda and so on, and then\nthe text continues, 'The higher knowledge\n\np. 138\n\nis that by which the Indestructible is apprehended.' Here the Indestructible\nis declared to be the subject of the higher knowledge. If we now were to\nassume that the Indestructible distinguished by invisibility and like\nqualities is something different from the highest Lord, the knowledge\nreferring to it would not be the higher one. For the distinction of lower and\nhigher knowledge is made on account of the diversity of their results, the\nformer leading to mere worldly exaltation, the latter to absolute bliss; and\nnobody would assume absolute bliss to result from the knowledge of the\npradhana.--Moreover, as on the view we are controverting the highest Self\nwould be assumed to be something higher than the imperishable source of all\nbeings, three kinds of knowledge would have to be acknowledged, while the text\nexpressly speaks of two kinds only.--Further, the reference to the knowledge\nof everything being implied in the knowledge of one thing--which is contained\nin the passage (I, 1, 3), 'Sir, what is that through which if it is known\neverything else becomes known?'--is possible only if the allusion is to\nBrahman the Self of all, and not either to the pradhana which comprises only\nwhat is non-intelligent or to the enjoyer viewed apart from the objects of\nenjoyment.--The text, moreover, by introducing the knowledge of Brahman as the\nchief subject-which it does in the passage (I, 1, 1), 'He told the knowledge\nof Brahman, the foundation of all knowledge, to his eldest son Atharvan'--and\nby afterwards declaring that out of the two kinds of knowledge, viz. the lower\none and the higher one, the higher one leads to the comprehension of the\nImperishable, shows that the knowledge of the Imperishable is the knowledge of\nBrahman. On the other hand, the term 'knowledge of Brahman' would become\nmeaningless if that Imperishable which is to be comprehended by means of it\nwere not Brahman. The lower knowledge of works which comprises the _Ri_\ng-veda, and so on, is mentioned preliminarily to the knowledge of Brahman for\nthe mere purpose of glorifying the latter; as appears from the passages in\nwhich it (the lower knowledge) is spoken of slightingly, such as (I, 2, 7),\n'But frail\n\np. 139\n\nindeed are those boats, the sacrifices, the eighteen in which this lower\nceremonial has been told. Fools who praise this as the highest good are\nsubject again and again to old age and death.' After these slighting remarks\nthe text declares that he who turns away from the lower knowledge is prepared\nfor the highest one (I, 2, 12), 'Let a Brhama _n_ a after he has examined all\nthese worlds which are gained by works acquire freedom from all desires.\nNothing that is eternal (not made) can be gained by what is not eternal\n(made). Let him in order to understand this take fuel in his hand and approach\na guru who is learned and dwells entirely in Brahman.'--The remark that,\nbecause the earth and other non-intelligent things are adduced as parallel\ninstances, that also which is compared to them, viz. the source of all beings\nmust be non-intelligent, is without foundation, since it is not necessary that\ntwo things of which one is compared to the other should be of absolutely the\nsame nature. The things, moreover, to which the source of all beings is\ncompared, viz. the earth and the like, are material, while nobody would assume\nthe source of all beings to be material.--For all these reasons the source of\nall beings, which possesses the attributes of invisibility and so on, is the\nhighest Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 22](sbe34059.htm)\n\n"
