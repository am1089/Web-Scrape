Now follows the _K_ andraya _n_ a (lunar penance).\n\n2\\. Let a man eat single mouthfuls (of food) unchanged in size;\n\n[XLVII. 1-10. M. XI, 217-222.--1-3. 9. Y. III, 324, 325.--1-4. Gaut. XXVII,\n12-15.\n\n2\\. 'Unchanged in size' means of that size precisely which the law\nprescribes.' Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya (III, 324) states that each daily {footnote p.\n151} portion must have the size of a peacock's egg, and Gautama (XXVII, 10)\nprescribes that the size of a mouthful shall be such as not to cause a\ndistortion of the mouth in swallowing it. (Nand.)]\n\np. 152\n\n3\\. And let him during the moon's increase add (successively) one mouthful\n(every day, so as to eat one mouthful on the first day of the moon's increase,\ntwo mouthfuls on the second day, and so on; fifteen mouthfuls on the day of\nfull moon), and during the wane of the moon let him take off one mouthful\n(every day, so as to eat fourteen mouthfuls on the first day of the moon's\nwane, thirteen mouthfuls on the second, and one mouthful on the fourteenth day\nof the moon's wane), and on the day of new moon let him fast entirely: thus\nhas the barley-shaped _K_ andraya _n_ a been described.\n\n4\\. Or the ant-shaped _K_ andraya _n_ a (may be performed).\n\n5\\. That _K_ andraya _n_ a is called 'ant-shaped' in which the day of new moon\nis placed in the middle.\n\n6\\. That one is, called 'barley-shaped' in which the day of full moon is\nplaced in the middle.\n\n7\\. If a man eats for a month eight mouthfuls a day, it is (the penance\ncalled) Yati _k_ andraya _n_ a (an hermit's _K_ andraya _n_ a).\n\n8\\. Eating (for a month) four mouthfuls each morning and evening is (the\npenance called) _S_ i _s_ u _k_ andraya _n_ a (a child's _K_ andraya _n_ a).\n\n9\\. Eating anyhow[1] three hundred minus sixty mouthfuls a month is the\npenance called Samanya _k_ andraya _n_ a (general _K_ andraya _n_ a).\n\n[9. 1 'Anyhow,' i. e, otherwise than ordained above, as e. g. eating four\nmouthfuls on one day, and twelve on the next day; or fasting on one day, and\neating sixteen mouthfuls on the following day; or fasting for two days, and\neating twenty-four mouthfuls on the third {footnote p. 153} day; or fasting\nfor three days, and eating thirty-two mouthfuls on the fourth day. (Nand.)]\n\np. 153\n\n10\\. After having performed this penance, in a former age, the seven holy _Ri_\nshis, Brahman, and Rudra acquired a splendid abode, O Earth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XLVIII.](sbe07050.htm)\n\n"
