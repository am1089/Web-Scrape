But (this is not so), on account of scriptural passages, and on account\nof (Brahman) resting on Scripture (only).\n\nThe word 'but' discards the objection.--We deny this and maintain that our\nview is not open to any objections.--That the entire Brahman undergoes change,\nby no means follows from our doctrine, 'on account of sacred texts.' For in\nthe same way as Scripture speaks of the origin of the world from Brahman, it\nalso speaks of Brahman subsisting apart from its effects. This appears from\nthe passages indicating the difference of cause and effect ('That divinity\nthought) let me enter into these three divinities with this living Self and\nevolve names and forms;' and, 'Such is the greatness of it, greater than it is\nthe Person; one foot of him are all things, three feet are what is immortal in\nheaven' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 12, 6); further, from the passages declaring the\nunmodified Brahman to have its abode in the heart, and from those teaching\nthat (in dreamless sleep) the individual soul is united with the True. For if\nthe entire Brahman had passed into its effects, the limitation (of the soul's\nunion with Brahman) to the state of dreamless sleep which is declared in the\npassage, 'then it is united with the True, my dear,' would be out of place;\nsince the individual soul is always united with the effects of Brahman, and\nsince an unmodified Brahman does not exist (on that hypothesis). Moreover, the\npossibility of Brahman becoming the object of perception by means of the\nsenses is denied while its effects may thus be perceived. For these reasons\nthe existence of an unmodified Brahman has to be. admitted.--Nor do we violate\nthose texts which declare Brahman to be without parts; we rather admit Brahman\nto be without parts just because Scripture reveals it. For Brahman which rests\nexclusively on the holy texts, and regarding which the holy texts alone are\nauthoritative--\n\np. 351\n\nnot the senses, and so on--must be accepted such as the texts proclaim it to\nbe. Now those texts declare, on the one hand, that not the entire Brahman\npasses over into its effects, and, on the other hand, that Brahman is without\nparts. Even certain ordinary things such as gems, spells, herbs, and the like\npossess powers which, owing to difference of time, place, occasion, and so on,\nproduce various opposite effects, and nobody unaided by instruction is able to\nfind out by mere reflection the number of these powers, their favouring\nconditions, their objects, their purposes, &c.; how much more impossible is it\nto conceive without the aid of Scripture the true nature of Brahman with its\npowers unfathomable by thought! As the Pura _n_ a says: 'Do not apply\nreasoning to what is unthinkable! The mark of the unthinkable is that it is\nabove all material causes 1.' Therefore the cognition of what is supersensuous\nis based on the holy texts only.\n\nBut--our opponent will say--even the holy texts cannot make us understand what\nis contradictory. Brahman, you say, which is without parts undergoes a change,\nbut not the entire Brahman. If Brahman is without parts, it does either not\nchange at all or it changes in its entirety. If, on the other hand, it be said\nthat it changes partly and persists partly, a break is effected in its nature,\nand from that it follows that it consists of parts. It is true that in matters\nconnected with action (as, for instance, in the case of the two Vedic\ninjunctions 'at the atiratra he is to take the sho _d_ a _s_ in-cup,' and 'at\nthe atiratra he is not to take the sho _d_ a _s_ in-cup') any contradiction\nwhich may present itself to the understanding is removed by the optional\nadoption of one of the two alternatives presented as action is dependent on\nman; but in the case under discussion the adoption of one of the alternatives\ndoes not remove the contradiction because an existent thing (like Brahman)\ndoes not (like an action which is to be accomplished) depend on man. We are\ntherefore met here by a real difficulty.\n\np. 352\n\nNo, we reply, the difficulty is merely an apparent one; as we maintain that\nthe (alleged) break in Brahman's nature is a mere figment of Nescience. By a\nbreak of that nature a thing is not really broken up into parts, not any more\nthan the moon is really multiplied by appearing double to a person of\ndefective vision. By that element of plurality which is the fiction of\nNescience, which is characterised by name and form, which is evolved as well\nas non-evolved, which is not to be defined either as the Existing or the Non-\nexisting, Brahman becomes the basis of this entire apparent world with its\nchanges, and so on, while in its true and real nature it at the same time\nremains unchanged, lifted above the phenomenal universe. And as the\ndistinction of names and forms, the fiction of Nescience, originates entirely\nfrom speech only, it does not militate against the fact of Brahman being\nwithout parts.--Nor have the scriptural passages which speak of Brahman as\nundergoing change the purpose of teaching the fact of change; for such\ninstruction would have no fruit. They rather aim at imparting instruction\nabout Brahman's Self as raised above this apparent world; that being an\ninstruction which we know to have a result of its own. For in the scriptural\npassage beginning 'He can only be described by No, no' (which passage conveys\ninstruction about the absolute Brahman) a result is stated at the end, in the\nwords 'O _G_ anaka, you have indeed reached fearlessness' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 2,\n4).--Hence our view does not involve any real difficulties.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[351:1](sbe34166.htm#fr_308) Prak _ri_ tibhya iti, pratyakshad _ri_ sh _t_\napadarthasvabhavebhyo yat para _m_ vilaksha _n_ am a _k_ aryadyupade _s_\nagamya _m_ tad a _k_ intyam ity arta _h_ \xc3\x82n.
