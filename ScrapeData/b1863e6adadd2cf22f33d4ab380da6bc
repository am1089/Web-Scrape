[4b](ry349.htm#fn_814)  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[399:1](ry348.htm#fr_810) I omit Canto V. which corresponds to chapter XI. in\nGorresio\'s edition. That scholar justly observes: "The eleventh chapter,\nDescription of Evening, is certainly the work of the Rhapsodists and an\ninterpolation of later date. The chapter might be omitted without any injury\nto the action of the poem, and besides the metre, style, conceits and images\ndiffer from the general tenour of the poem; and that continual repetition of\nthe same sounds at the end of each hemistich which is not exactly rime, but\nassonance, reveals the artificial labour of a more recent age.\' The following\nsample will probably be enough. I am unable to show the difference of style in\na translation:\n\n  \nFair shone the moon, as if to lend  \nHis cheering light to guide a friend,  \nAnd, circled by the starry host,  \nLooked down upon the wild sea-coast.  \nThe Vanar cheiftain raised his eyes,  \nAnd saw him sailing through the skies  \nLike a bright swan who joys to take  \nHis pastime on a silver lake;  \nFair moon that calms the mourner\'s pain.  \nHeaves up the waters of the main,  \nAnd o\'er the *hie beneath him throws  \nA tender light of soft repose,  \nThe charm that clings to Mandar\'s hill,  \nGleams in the sea when winds are still,  \nAnd decks the lilly\'s opening flower,  \nShowed in that moon her sweetest power.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto VII.: Ravan\'s Palace.](ry349.htm)\n\n'
