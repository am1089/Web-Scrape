May Agni, beloved of many, the guest of the house\n[1](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:1:1), be praised in the morning, the immortal who\ndelights [2](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:1:2) in all offerings among the mortals.\n\n2 [1](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:2:1). To Dvita who by the liberal power of his\ndexterousness carries away injury [2](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:2:2), this praiser\nof thine, O immortal, prepares Soma in the due way.\n\n3\\. I call for your sake Him who flames through long life, with the speech\nthat belongs to the liberal patrons [1](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:3:1) whose\nchariot moves uninjured, O giver of horses [2](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:3:2);\n\n4\\. And in whom (dwells) brilliant thought, who guard the hymns of praise in\ntheir mouth, (whose) sacrificial grass is spread in the realm of the sun: they\nhave invested themselves with glory.\n\n5\\. On the liberal patrons who have given me fifty horses for my song of\npraise [1](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:5:1), bestow brilliant, mighty, high glory, O\nAgni; on those men (bestow glory) with (valiant) men, O immortal!\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is M _ri_ ktavahas Dvita \xc3\x82treya (see verse 2); the metre is the\nsame.--Verse 1 = SV. I, 85. Verse 5 = TB. II, 7, 5, 2.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Vi _s_ a _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 atithi _h_ : cf. above, V, 3, 5.\n\nNote 2. On ran with the accusative, compare Gaedicke, p. 76.\n\np. 406\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Compare on this verse Macdonell, Journal Roy. As. Soc., 1893, p. 463\nseq.\n\nNote 2. Dvita, who seems to be identified with Agni, is, in the same way as\nTrita (see Bloomfield, Proceedings Amer. Or. Soc., March, 1894, p. cxix\nseqq.), supposed to take away human sin and all sorts of mischief and\nmisfortune (cf. VIII, 47, 16. Trita\xc2\xb4ya _k_ a Dvita\xc2\xb4ya _k_ a usha _h_\ndushvapnyam vaha). Thus he is invoked here as carrying away m _ri_ kta, i. e.\ninjury.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The speech of the priest belongs to the sacrificer who has engaged\nhim.\n\nNote 2. This seems to be Agni, with an evident allusion to the human giver of\nhorses (see verse 5).\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Sadhastuti seems to be instrumental. Cf. Lanman, p. 381.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 19](sbe46123.htm)\n\n'
