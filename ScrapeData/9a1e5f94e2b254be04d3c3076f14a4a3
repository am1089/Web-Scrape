And on account of the permanency of the final (size of the soul) and the\nresulting permanency of the two (preceding sizes) there is no difference (of\nsize, at any time).\n\nMoreover, the _G_ ainas themselves admit the permanency of the final size of\nthe soul which it has in the state of release. From this it follows also that\nits initial size and its intervening sizes must be permanent  1, and that\nhence\n\np. 434\n\nthere is no difference between the three sizes. But this would involve the\nconclusion that the different bodies of the soul have one and the same size,\nand that the soul cannot enter into bigger and smaller bodies.--Or else (to\nexplain the Sutra in a somewhat different way) from the fact that the final\nsize of the soul is permanent, it follows that its size in the two previous\nconditions also is permanent. Hence the soul must be considered as being\nalways of the same size--whether minute or infinite--and not of the varying\nsize of its bodies.--For this reason also the doctrine of the Arhat has to be\nset aside as not in any way more rational than the doctrine of Buddha.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[433:1](sbe34212.htm#fr_420) The inference being that the initial and\nintervening sizes of the soul must be permanent because they are sizes of the\nsoul, like its final size.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 37](sbe34213.htm)\n\n'
