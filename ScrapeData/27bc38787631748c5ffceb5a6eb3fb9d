That alone should be the \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na of the\nMunis as well as of men, which is full of pains, which is difficult to\nmeditate on, which is difficult to perceive, which is the emancipated one,\nwhich is decayless and which is difficult to attain. One whose food is\nmoderate, whose anger has been controlled, who has given up all love for\nsociety, who has subdued his passions, who has overcome all pairs (heat and\ncold etc.), who has given up his egoism, who does not bless anyone nor take\nanything from others, and also who goes where they naturally ought not to go,\nand naturally would not go where they like to go--such persons also obtain\nthree 2 in the face. Hamsa is said to have three seats. Therefore know it is\nthe greatest of mysteries, without sleep and without support. It is very\nsubtle, of the form of Soma, and is the supreme seat of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u. That seat has\nthree faces, three gu\xe1\xb9\x87as and three \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadus, and is formless, motionless,\nchangeless, sizeless, and supportless. That seat is without up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, and is\nabove the reach of speech and\n\np. 79\n\nmind. It is Svabh\xc4\x81va (Self or nature) reachable only by bh\xc4\x81va (being). The\nindestructible seat is associateless, without bliss, beyond mind, difficult to\nperceive, emancipated and changeless. It should be meditated upon as the\nliberated, the eternal, the permanent and the indestructible. It is Brahman,\nis a\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma (or the deity presiding as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) and is the highest seat of\nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u. It is inconceivable, of the nature of Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and above the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, is\nvoid and non-void, and beyond the void, and is abiding in the heart. There is\n(in It) neither meditation nor meditator, nor the meditated, nor the non-\nmeditated. It is not the universe. It is the highest space; it is neither\nsupreme nor above the supreme. It is inconceivable, unknowable, non-truth, and\nnot the highest. It is realised by the Munis, but the \xe1\xb8\x8cevas do not know the\nsupreme One. Avarice, delusion, fear, pride, passion, anger, sin, heat, cold,\nhunger, thirst, thought and fancy--(all these do not exist in It). (In It)\nthere is no pride of (belonging to) the Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a caste, nor is there the\ncollection of the knot of salvation. (In It) there is no fear, no happiness,\nno pains, neither fame nor disgrace. That which is without these states is the\nsupreme Brahman.\n\nYama, 1 (forbearance), niyama (religious observance), ty\xc4\x81ga (renunciation),\nmouna (silence) according to time and place, \xc4\x81sana (posture), m\xc5\xablaban\xe1\xb8\x8dha,\nseeing all bodies as equal, the position of the eye, pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a-samyamana (control\nof breath), pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra (subjugation of the senses), \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87a, \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma-\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na and\nsam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi--these are spoken of as the parts (of yoga) in order. That is called\nyama in which one controls all his organs (of sense and actions) through the\nvij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na that all is Brahman; this should be practised often and often. Niyama,\nin which there is the supreme bliss enjoyed through the flowing (or\ninclination) of the mind towards things of the same (spiritual) kind, (\n_viz_., Brahman) and the abandoning of things differing from one another is\npractised by the sages as a rule. In ty\xc4\x81ga (renunciation), one abandons the\nmanifestations (or objects) of the universe through the cognition of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 that\nis Sa\xe1\xb9\xad and Chi\xe1\xb9\xad. This is practised by the great and is the giver of immediate\nsalvation.\n\np. 80\n\n[paragraph continues] Mouna (the silence), in which, without reaching That,\nspeech returns along with mind, is fit to be attained by the Yogins and should\nbe ever worshipped by the ignorant (even). How is it possible to speak of\n"That", from which speech returns? How should it be described as the universe\nas there is no word to describe it? It is "That" which is (really) called\nsilence, and which is naturally understood (as such). There is silence in\nchildren, but with words (latent); whereas the knowers of Brahman have it\n(silence) but without words. That should be known as "the lonely seat" in\nwhich there is no man in the beginning, middle, or end, and through which all\nthis (universe) is fully pervaded. The illusion of Brahm\xc4\x81 and all other beings\ntakes place within one twinkling (of His eye). That should be known as \xc4\x81sana\n(posture), in which one has with ease and without fatigue (uninterrupted)\nmeditation of Brahman; that is described by the word k\xc4\x81la (time), that is\nendless bliss and that is secondless. Everything else is the destroyer of\nhappiness. That is called si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81sana (si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha-posture) in which the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhas\n(psychical personages) have succeeded in realising the endless One as the\nsupport of the universe containing all the elements, etc. That is called the\nm\xc5\xablaban\xe1\xb8\x8dha, which is the M\xc5\xabla (root) of all worlds, and through which the root\nChi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada is (ba\xe1\xb9\x87dha) bound. It should be always practised by the R\xc4\x81jayogins.\n\nOne after having known the equality of the a\xe1\xb9\x85gas (or parts of yoga) point to\none and the same Brahman, should be absorbed in that equal (or uniform)\nBrahman; if not, there is not that equality (attained). Then like a dry tree,\nthere is straightness (or uniformity throughout). Making one\'s vision full of\nspiritual wisdom, one should look upon the world as full of Brahman. That\nvision is very noble. It is (generally) aimed at the tip of the nose; but it\nshould be directed towards that seat (of Brahman) wherein the cessation of\nseer, the seen, and sight will take place, and not towards the tip of the\nnose. That is called pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma (the control of breath), in which there is the\ncontrol of the modifications (of mind) through the cognition of Brahman in all\nthe states of chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, and others. The checking of\n\np. 81\n\n[paragraph continues] (the conception of the reality of) the universe, is said\nto be expiration. The conception of "I am Brahman" is inspiration. The holding\non (long) to this conception without agitation is cessation of breath. Such is\nthe practice of the enlightened. The ignorant close their nose. That should be\nknown as pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra, through which one sees \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (even) in the objects of\nsense, and pleases chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada through manas. It should be practised often and\noften. Through seeing Brahman wherever the mind goes, the \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87a of the mind\nis obtained. \xe1\xb8\x8ch\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 is thought of highly by the wise. By \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87a is meant\nthat state where one indulges in the good thought, "I am Brahman alone," and\nis without any support. This \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na is the giver of supreme bliss. Being first\nin a state of changelessness, and then thoroughly forgetting (even) that state\nowing to the cognition of the (true) nature of Brahman--this is called\nsam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. This kind of bliss should be practised (or enjoyed) by a wise person\ntill his cognition itself united in a moment with the state of pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81).\nThen this King of Yogins becomes a Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha, and is without any aid (outside\nhimself). Then he will attain a state, inexpressible and unthinkable.\n\nWhen sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is practised, the following obstacles arise with great force--\nabsence of right inquiry, laziness, inclination to enjoyment, absorption (in\nmaterial object), \xe1\xb9\xadamas, distraction, impatience, sweat, and absent-\nmindedness. All these obstacles should be overcome by inquirers into Brahman.\nThrough bh\xc4\x81vav\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadis (worldly thoughts), one gets into them. Through \xc5\x9b\xc5\xabnya-\nv\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadis (void or empty thoughts), one gets into them. But through the v\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadis of\nBrahman, one gets fullness. Therefore one should develop fullness through this\nmeans (of Brahman). He who abandons this v\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi of Brahman, which is very\npurifying and supreme--that man lives in vain like a beast. But he who\nunderstands this v\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi (of Brahman), and having understood it makes advances\nin it, becomes a good and blessed person, deserving to be worshipped by the\nthree worlds. Those who are greatly developed through the ripening (of their\npast karmas) attain the state of Brahman; others are simply reciters of words.\n\np. 82\n\n[paragraph continues] Those who are clever in arguments about Brahman, but are\nwithout the action pertaining to Brahman, and who are greatly attached to the\nworld--those certainly are born again and again (in this world) through their\naj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na; (the former) never remain, even for half a moment--without the v\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi\nof Brahman, like Brahma and others, Sanaka, 1 etc., \xc5\x9auka and others. When a\ncause is subject to changes, it (as an effect) must also have its cause. When\nthe cause ceases to exist in truth, the effect perishes through right\ndiscrimination. Then that substance (or principle) which is beyond the scope\nof words, remains pure. After that, v\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na arises in their purified mind;\nthrough meditation with transcendental energy, there arises a firm certitude.\nAfter reducing the visible into the invisible state, one should see everything\nas Brahman. The wise should ever stay in bliss with their understanding full\nof the essence of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad. Thus ends the first chapter of \xe1\xb9\xacejobin\xe1\xb8\x8du.\n\n##### Chapter II\n\nThen the Kum\xc4\x81ra 2 asked \xc5\x9aiva: "Please explain to me the nature of Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra,\nthat is the partless non-dual essence." The great \xc5\x9aiva replied: "The partless\nnon-dual essence is the visible. It is the world, it is the existence, it is\nthe Self, it is man\xe1\xb9\xadra, it is action, it is spiritual wisdom, it is water. It\nis the earth, it is \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, it is the books, it is the three Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, it is the\nBrahman, it is the religious vow, it is J\xc4\xabva, it is Aja (the unborn), it is\nBrahma, it is Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, it is Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra; it is I, it is \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma, it is the Guru. It is\nthe aim, it is sacrifice, it is the body, it is manas, it is chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, it is\nhappiness, it is vi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81; it is the undifferentiated, it is the eternal, it is\nthe supreme, it is everything. O six-faced one, different from It there is\nnothing. None, none but It; It is I. It is gross, it is subtle, it is\nknowable, it is thou; it is the mysterious; it is the knower; it is existence,\nit is mother, it is father, it is brother, it is husband, it is S\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81),\nit is Vir\xc4\x81t.\n\np. 83\n\n[paragraph continues] It is the body, it is the head, it is the internal, it\nis the external, it is full, it is nectar, it is go\xe1\xb9\xadra (clan), it is g\xe1\xb9\x9bha (the\nhouse), it is the preservable, it is the moon, it is the stars, it is the sun,\nit is the holy seat. It is forgiveness, it is patience, it is the gu\xe1\xb9\x87as, it is\nthe witness. It is a friend, it is a relative, it is an ally, it is the king,\ntown, kingdom and subjects. It is Om, japa, meditation, the seat, the one\nworthy to be taken (in), the heart, the Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis, Swarga (heaven) and Self."\n\n"All the partless and non-dual essence should be regarded as Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra.\nChinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra alone is the Absolute Consciousness; and this partless non-dual\nessence alone is the (real) essence. All having consciousness alone except\nthose having changes, are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. All this is Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. He is Chinmaya;\nthe state of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is known as Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra and the partless non-dual essence. The\nwhole world is Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Your state and my state are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, earth,\nwater, v\xc4\x81yu, agni, Brahm\xc4\x81, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, \xc5\x9aiva and all else that exist or do not, are\nChinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. That which is the partless non-dual essence is Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. All the\npast, present, and future are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Substance and time are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra.\nKnowledge and the knowable are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. The knower is Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Everything\nis Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Every speech is Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Whatever else is Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Asa\xe1\xb9\xad and\nSa\xe1\xb9\xad are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. The beginning and end are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra; that which is in the\nbeginning and end is Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra ever. The Guru and the disciple are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra.\nIf the seer and the seen are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra, then they are always Chinmaya. All\nthings wondrous are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. The (gross) body is Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra, as also the\nsubtle and causal bodies. There is nothing beyond Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. I and thou are\nChinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Form and non-form are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Virtue and vice are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. The\nbody is a symbol of Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa, knowing, man\xe1\xb9\xadra, and others, the gods\ninvoked in man\xe1\xb9\xadras, the gods presiding over the eight quarters, the phenomenal\nand the supreme Brahman are nothing but Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. There is nothing without\nChinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 is nothing without Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. P\xc5\xabj\xc4\x81 (worship) is nothing\nwithout Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Meditation, truth, sheaths and others, the (eight) valus,\nsilence, non-silence, and indifference to objects\n\np. 84\n\n[paragraph continues] --are nothing without Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Everything is from\nChinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Whatever is seen and however seen--it is Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra so far. Whatever\nexists and however distant, is Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Whatever elements exist, whatever is\nperceived, and whatever is ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada--all these are Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Without\nChinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra, there is no motion, no Moksha and no goal aimed at. Everything is\nChinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Brahman that is the partless non-dual essence is known to be\nnothing but Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. Thou, O Lord, art the partless non-dual essence\n(stated) in the books, in me, in Thee, and in the ruler. He who thus perceives\n\'I\' as of one homogeneity (pervading everywhere) will at once be emancipated\nthrough this spiritual wisdom. He is his own Guru with this profound spiritual\nwisdom. Thus ends the second chapter of \xe1\xb9\xacejobin\xe1\xb8\x8du."\n\n##### Chapter III\n\nThe Kum\xc4\x81ra addressed his father (again): "Please explain to me the realisation\nof \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma." To which the great \xc5\x9aiva said: "I am of the nature of the\nParabrahman. I am the supreme bliss. I am solely of the nature of divine\nwisdom. I am the sole supreme, the sole quiescence, the sole Chinmaya, the\nsole unconditioned, the sole permanent and the sole Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva. I am the \'I\' that\nhas given up \'I\'. I am one that is without anything. I am full of Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. I\nam the sole fourth one. I am the sole one above the fourth (state of \xe1\xb9\xadurya). I\nam of the nature of (pure) consciousness. I am ever of the nature of the\nbliss-consciousness. I am of the nature of the non-dual. I am ever of a pure\nnature, solely of the nature of divine wisdom, of the nature of happiness,\nwithout fancies, desires or diseases, of the nature of bliss, without changes\nor differentiations, and of the nature of the eternal one essence and\nChinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. My real nature is indescribable, of endless bliss, the bliss above\nSa\xe1\xb9\xad and Chi\xe1\xb9\xad and the interior of the interior. I am beyond reach of manas and\nspeech. I am of the nature of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmic bliss, true bliss and one who plays with\n(my) \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. I am \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and Sa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xc5\x9biva. My nature is \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmic spiritual effulgence. I\nam the essence of the jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. I am without beginning, middle, or end.\nI am like the\n\np. 85\n\nsky. I am solely Sa\xe1\xb9\xad, \xc4\x80nan\xe1\xb8\x8da, and Chi\xe1\xb9\xad which is unconditioned and pure. I am\nthe Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da that is eternal, enlightened and pure. I am ever of the\nnature of the eternal \xc5\x9aesha (serpent-time). I am ever beyond all. My nature is\nbeyond form. My form is supreme \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. My nature is of the bliss of earth. I am\never without speech. My nature is the all-seat (foundation of all). I am ever\nreplete with consciousness, without the attachment of body, without thought,\nwithout the modifications of chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, the sole essence of Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma, beyond the\nvisibility of all and of the form of vision. My nature is ever full. I am ever\nfully contented, the all, and Brahman, and the very consciousness; I am \'I\'.\nMy nature is of the earth. I am the great \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and the supreme of the supreme;\nI appear sometimes as different from myself; sometimes as possessing a body,\nsometimes as a pupil and sometimes as the basis of the worlds. I am beyond the\nthree periods of time, am worshipped by the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, am determined by the\nsciences and am fixed in the chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada. There is nothing left out by me, neither\nthe earth nor any other objects here. Know that there is nothing which is out\nof myself. I am Brahma, a Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha, the eternally pure, non-dual one, Brahman,\nwithout old age or death. I shine by myself; I am my own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, my own goal,\nenjoy myself, play in myself, have my own spiritual effulgence, am my own\ngreatness, and am used to play in my own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, look on my own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and am in\nmyself happily seated. I have my own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as the residue, stay in my own\nconsciousness, and play happily in the kingdom of my own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Sitting on the\nreal throne of my own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, I think of nothing else but my own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma. I am\nChi\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc5\xabpa alone, Brahman alone, Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da, the second-less, the one\nreplete with bliss and the sole Brahman and ever without anything, have the\nbliss of my own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, the unconditioned bliss, and am always \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma-\xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. I\nalone am in the heart like Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8di\xe1\xb9\xadya (the consciousness-sun). I am content in\nmy own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, have no form, or no decay, am without the number one, have the\nnature of an unconditionod and emancipated one, and I am subtler than \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b; I\nam without the existence of beginning or end, of the nature of the\n\np. 86\n\nall-illuminating, the bliss greater than the great, of the sole nature of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad,\nof the nature of pure Moksha, of the nature of truth and bliss, full of\nspiritual wisdom and bliss, of the nature of wisdom alone, and of the nature\nof Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da. All this is Brahman alone. There is none other than Brahman\nand that is \'I\'.\n\n"I am Brahman that is Sa\xe1\xb9\xad, and bliss, and the ancient. The word \'thou\' and the\nword \'that\' are not different from me. I am of the nature of consciousness. I\nam alone the great \xc5\x9aiva. I am beyond the nature of existence. I am of the\nnature of happiness. As there is nothing that can witness me, I am without the\nstate of witness. Being purely of the nature of Brahman, I am the eternal\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. I alone am the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb8\x8di\xc5\x9besha (the primeval \xc5\x9aesha). 1 I alone am the \xc5\x9aesha. I\nam without name and form, of the nature of bliss, of the nature of being\nunperceivable by the senses, and of the nature of all beings; I have neither\nbondage nor salvation. I am of the form of eternal bliss. I am the primeval\nconsciousness alone, the partless and non-dual essence, beyond reach of speech\nand mind, of the nature of bliss everywhere, of the nature of fullness\neverywhere, of the nature of earthly bliss, of the nature of contentment\neverywhere, the supreme nectary essence, and the one and secondless Sa\xe1\xb9\xad, (\n_viz_.,) Brahman. There is no doubt of it. I am of the nature of all-void. I\nam the one that is given out by the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. I am of the nature of the\nemancipated and emancipation, of Nirv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87ic bliss, of truth and wisdom, of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\nalone and bliss, of the one beyond the fourth, of one without fancy, and ever\nof the nature of Aja (the unborn). I am without passion or faults. I am the\npure, the enlightened, the eternal, the all-pervading and of the nature of the\nsignificance of Om, of the spotless, and of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad. I am neither existing nor\nnon-existing. I am not of the nature of anything. I am of the nature of the\nactionless. I am without parts. I have no semblance, no manas, no sense, no\nbu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, no change, none of the three bodies, neither the waking, dreaming, or\ndreamless sleeping states. I am neither of the nature of the three pains nor\nof the three desires.

Being without the conception \'I am the partless non-dual\nessence\' or \'I am the blissful,\' and being of the nature of the one beyond all\n--that is one Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis at the end of n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da. He who is devoid of the significance\nof \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 ( _viz_. motion) and devoid of Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da--he is alone \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, the\neternal. He who is undefinable and unreachable by the words of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, who\nhas neither externals nor internals, and whose symbol is either the universe\nor Brahman--he is undoubtedly \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. He who has no body, nor\n\np. 94\n\nis a J\xc4\xabva made up of the elements and their compounds, who has neither form\nnor name, neither the enjoyable nor the enjoyer, neither Sa\xe1\xb9\xad nor asa\xe1\xb9\xad, neither\npreservation nor regeneration, neither gu\xe1\xb9\x87a nor non-gu\xe1\xb9\x87a--that is undoubtedly\nmy \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. He who has neither the described nor description, neither \xc5\x9brava\xe1\xb9\x87a nor\nmanana, neither Guru nor disciple, neither the world of the \xe1\xb8\x8cevas nor the\n\xe1\xb8\x8cevas nor Asuras, neither duty nor non-duty, neither the immaculate nor non-\nimmaculate, neither time nor non-time, neither certainty nor doubt, neither\nman\xe1\xb9\xadra nor non-man\xe1\xb9\xadra, neither science nor non-science, neither the seer nor\nthe sight which is subtle, nor the nectar of time--that is \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Rest assured\nthat not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is a misnomer. There is no manas as not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. There is no world\nas not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma. Owing to the absence of all sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpas and to the giving up of all\nactions, Brahman alone remains, and there is no not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Being devoid of the\nthree bodies, the three periods of time, the three gu\xe1\xb9\x87as of J\xc4\xabva, the three\npains and the three worlds, and following the saying \'All is Brahman,\' know\nthat there is nothing to be known through the absence of chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada; there is no\nold age through the absence of body; no motion through the absence of legs; no\naction through the absence of hands; no death through the absence of\ncreatures; no happiness through the absence of bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi; no virtue, no purity,\nno fear, no repetition of man\xe1\xb9\xadras, no Guru nor disciple. There is no second in\nthe absence of one. Where there is not the second, there is not the first.\nWhere there is truth alone, there is no non-truth possible; where there is\nnon-truth alone, there is no truth possible. If you regard a thing auspicious\nas inauspicious, then auspiciousness is desired (as separate) from\ninauspiciousness. If you regard fear as non-fear, then fear will arise out of\nnon-fear. If bondage should become emancipation, then in the absence of\nbondage will be no emancipation. If birth should imply death, then in the\nabsence of birth, there is no death. If \'thou\' should imply \'I,\' then in the\nabsence of \'thou\' there is no \'I\'. If \'this\' should be \'that,\' \'this\' does not\nexist in the absence of \'that\'. If being should imply non-being, then non-\nbeing will imply being. If an effect implies a cause, then in the absence\n\np. 95\n\nof effect, there is no cause. If duality implies non-duality, then in the\nabsence of duality, there is no non-duality. If there should be the seen, then\nthere is the eye (or sight); in the absence of the seen, there is no eye. In\nthe absence of the interior, there is no exterior. If there should be\nfullness, then non-fullness is possible. Therefore (all) this exists nowhere.\nNeither you nor I, nor this nor these exist. There exists no (object of)\ncomparison in the true one. There is no simile in the unborn. There is (in it)\nno mind to think. I am the supreme Brahman. This world is Brahman only. Thou\nand I are Brahman only. I am Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra simply, and there is no not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Rest\nassured of it. This universe is not (really at all). This universe is not\n(really) at all. It was nowhere produced and stays nowhere. Some say that\nchi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada is the universe. Not at all. It exists not. Neither the universe nor\nchi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada nor aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra nor J\xc4\xabva exists (really). Neither the creation of M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 nor\nM\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 itself exists (really). Fear does not (really) exist. Actor, action,\nhearing, thinking, the two sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhis, the measurer, the measure, aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and\naviveka--none of these exists (truly) anywhere. Therefore the four moving 1\nconsiderations and the three kinds of relationship exist not. There is no\nGa\xe1\xb9\x85g\xc4\x81, no Gaya, no Se\xe1\xb9\xadu (bridge), no elements or anything else, no earth,\nwater, fire, v\xc4\x81yu, and \xc4\x81kas anywhere, no \xe1\xb8\x8cevas, no guardians of the four\nquarters, no Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, no Guru, no distance, no proximity, no time, no middle, no\nnon-duality, no truth, no untruth, no bondage, no emancipation, no Sa\xe1\xb9\xad, no\nasa\xe1\xb9\xad, no happiness, etc., no class, no motion, no caste, and no worldly\nbusiness. All is Brahman only and nothing else--all is Brahman only and\nnothing else. There exists then nothing (or statement) as that \'consciousness\nalone is\'; there is (then) no saying such as \'Chi\xe1\xb9\xad is I\'. The statement \'I am\nBrahman\' does not exist (then); nor does exist (then) the statement: \'I am the\neternally pure\'. Whatever is uttered by the mouth, whatever is thought by\nmanas, whatever is determined by bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, whatever is cognized by chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada--all\nthese do not exist. There is no Yogin or\n\np. 96\n\nyoga then. All are and are not. Neither day nor night, neither bathing nor\ncontemplating, neither delusion nor non-delusion--all these do not exist then.\nKnow that is no not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.\n\nThe Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, Sciences, Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, effect and cause, \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara and the world and the\nelements and mankind--all these are unreal. There is no doubt of it. Bondage,\nsalvation, happiness, relatives, meditation, chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, the \xe1\xb8\x8cevas, the demons,\nthe secondary and the primary, the high and the low--all these are unreal.\nThere is no doubt of it. Whatever is uttered by the mouth, whatever is willed\nby sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa, whatever is thought by manas--all these are unreal. Whatever is\ndetermined by the bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, whatever is cognized by chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, whatever is\ndiscussed by the religious books, whatever is seen by the eye and heard by the\nears, and whatever exists as Sa\xe1\xb9\xad, as also the ear, the eye, and the limbs--all\nthese are unreal. Whatever is described as such and such, whatever is thought\nas so-and-so, all the existing thoughts such as \'thou art I\', \'that is this,\'\nand \'He is I,\' and whatever happens in moksha, as also all sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpas,\ndelusion, illusory attribution, mysteries and all the diversities of enjoyment\nand sin--all these do not exist. So is also not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Mine and thine, my and\nthy, for me and for thee, by me and by thee--all these are unreal. (The\nstatement) that Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u is the preserver, Brahm\xc4\x81 is the creator, Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra is the\ndestroyer--know that these undoubtedly are false. Bathing, utterings of\nman\xe1\xb9\xadras, japas (religious austerities) homa (sacrifice), study of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das,\nworship of the \xe1\xb8\x8cevas, man\xe1\xb9\xadra, \xe1\xb9\xadan\xe1\xb9\xadra, association with the good, the unfolding\nof the faults of gu\xe1\xb9\x87as, the working of the internal organ, the result of\navi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81, and the many crores of mundane eggs--all these are unreal. Whatever is\nspoken of as true according to the verdict of all teachers, whatever is seen\nin this world and whatever exists--all these are unreal. Whatever is uttered\nby words, whatever is ascertained, spoken, enjoyed, given or done by anyone,\nwhatever action is done, good or bad, whatever is done as truth--know all\nthese to be unreal. Thou alone art the transcendental \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and the supreme\nGuru of the form of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, which is devoid of fitness (for it) and of the\nnature of all creatures.\n\np. 97\n\n[paragraph continues] Thou art Brahman; thou art time; and thou art Brahman,\nthat is ever and imponderable.

Thou art impartial, Sa\xe1\xb9\xad and the ancient knowledge, recognised by\nthe words \'Truth, etc\'. Thou art devoid of all parts. Thou art the ever-\nexisting--thou appearest as Brahm\xc4\x81, Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra, In\xe1\xb8\x8dra, etc.--thou art above the\nillusion of the universe--thou shinest in all elements--thou art without\nsa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa in all--thou art known by means of the underlying meaning of all\nscriptures; thou art ever content and ever happily seated (in thyself); thou\nart without motion; etc. In all things, thou art without any characteristics;\nin all things thou art contemplated by Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u and other \xe1\xb8\x8cevas at all times;\nthou hast the nature of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad, thou art Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 unchecked, thou stayest in\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 itself, thou art void of everything and without gums, thou art bliss, the\ngreat, the one secondless, the state of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad and asa\xe1\xb9\xad, the knower, the known,\nthe seer, the nature of Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da, the lord of \xe1\xb8\x8cevas, the all-pervading,\nthe deathless, the moving, the motionless, the all and the non-all with\nquiescence and non-quiescence, Sa\xe1\xb9\xad alone, Sa\xe1\xb9\xad commonly (found in all), of the\nform of Ni\xe1\xb9\xadya-Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha (the unconditioned developed one), and yet devoid of all\nsi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis. There is not an atom which thou dost not penetrate; but yet thou art\nwithout it. Thou art devoid of existence and non-existence as also the aim and\nobject aimed at. Thou art changeless, decayless, beyond all n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8das, without\nk\xc4\x81la or k\xc4\x81shta (divisions of time) and without Brahm\xc4\x81, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, and \xc5\x9aiva. Thou\nlookest into the nature of each and art above the nature of each. Thou art\nimmersed in the bliss of Self. Thou art the monarch of the kingdom of Self,\nand yet without the conception of Self. Thou art of the nature of fullness and\nincompleteness. There is nothing that thou seest which is not in thyself. Thou\ndost not stir out of thy nature. Thou attest according to the nature of each.\nThou art nothing but the nature of each.

The conception \'I am the body\' is spoken of as\nthe knot of the heart, as non-wisdom, as the state of asa\xe1\xb9\xad, as nescience, as\nthe dual, as the true J\xc4\xabva and as with parts, is certainly the great sin, and\nis the disease generated by the fault of thirst after desires.

Whatever is seen in this\nworld, whatever is spoken of by the people, whatever is enjoyed everywhere--\nall these are asa\xe1\xb9\xad (unreal) only. The differences arising from the actor,\naction, qualities, likes, taste and gender--all these arise from asa\xe1\xb9\xad and are\n(but) pleasurable.\n\np. 102\n\n[paragraph continues] The differences arising from time, objects, actions,\nsuccess or defeat and whatever else--all these are simply asa\xe1\xb9\xad. The internal\norgan is asa\xe1\xb9\xad. The organs are asa\xe1\xb9\xad. All the pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, the collections of all\nthese, the five sheaths, the five deities, the six changes, the six enemies,\nthe six seasons, and the six tastes, are asa\xe1\xb9\xad. I am Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da. The\nuniverse is rootless. I am \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 alone, Chi\xe1\xb9\xad and \xc4\x80nan\xe1\xb8\x8da. The scenes of mundane\nexistence are not different. I am the Truth of the nature of \xc4\x80nan\xe1\xb8\x8da and of the\nnature of the imponderable Chi\xe1\xb9\xad. All this is of the nature of j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na.\n\n"I am the secondless, having j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and bliss. I am of the nature of an\nilluminator of all things. I am of the nature of all non-being. I alone shine\nalways. Therefore how can I with such a nature become asa\xe1\xb9\xad? That which is\ncalled \'thou\' is the great Brahman of the nature of the bliss of consciousness\nand of the nature of chi\xe1\xb9\xad having chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b and chi\xe1\xb9\xad alone as the great bliss.\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 alone is \'I\'. Asa\xe1\xb9\xad is not \'I\'. I am K\xc5\xabtas\xe1\xb9\xadha, the great guru and\nSachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da alone. I am this born universe. No time, no universe, no m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81,\nno prak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi (in me). I alone am the Hari. Personally, I alone am the Sa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xc5\x9biva.\nI am of the nature of pure consciousness. I am the enjoyer of pure sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva. I\nam the only essence full of chi\xe1\xb9\xad. Everything is Brahman and Brahman alone.\nEverything is Brahman and is chi\xe1\xb9\xad alone. I am of the nature of the all-latent\nand the all-witness. I am the supreme \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, the supreme Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis, the supreme\nwealth, the supreme goal, the essence of all ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadas, the subject discussed\nin all the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras the nature of yogic bliss, the ocean of the chief bliss,\nthe brightness of all wisdom, of the nature of chief wisdom, the brightness of\nthe fourth state and the non-fourth but devoid of them, the indestructible\nchi\xe1\xb9\xad, truth, V\xc4\x81su\xe1\xb8\x8deva, the birthless, and the deathless Brahm\xc4\x81, Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, the\nunconditioned, the stainless, the immaculate, the emancipated, the utterly\nemancipated, the soulless, the formless and of the nature of the non-created\nuniverse.\n\n"The universe which is assumed as truth and non-truth does not really exist.\nBrahman is of the nature of eternal bliss and\n\np. 103\n\nis even by itself. It is endless, decayless, quiescent and of one nature only.\nIf anything is other than myself, then it is as unreal as the mirage in an\noasis. If one should be afraid of the son of a barren woman, or if a powerful\nelephant be killed by means of the horns of a hare, then the world (really\nis). If one (person) can quench his thirst by drinking the waters of the\nmirage, or if one should be killed by the horns of a man, then the universe\nreally is. The universe exists always in the true Gan\xe1\xb8\x8dharva city (merely\nunreal). When the blueness of the, sky really exists in it, then the universe\nreally is. When the silver in mother-of-pearl can be used in making an\nornament, when a man is bitten by (the conception of) a snake in a rope, when\nthe flaming fire is quenched by means of a golden arrow, when milky food is\nobtained in the (barren) forest of Vindhya (mountains), when cooking can take\nplace by means of the fuel of (wet) plantain trees, when a female (baby) just\nborn begins to cook, when curds resume the state of milk, or when the milk\n(milked) goes back through the teats of a cow, then will the universe really\nbe. When the dust of the earth shall be produced in the ocean, when the\nmaddened elephant is tied by means of the hair of a tortoise, when (mountain)\nMeru is shaken by the thread in the stalk of a lotus, when the ocean is bound\nby its rows of tides, when the fire flames downwards, when flame shall become\n(really) cold, when the lotus shall grow out of flaming fire, when In\xe1\xb8\x8dran\xc4\xabla\n(sapphire) arises in the great mountains, when Meru comes and sits in the\nlotus-eye, when a mountain can become the offspring of a black bee, when Meru\nshall shake, when a lion is killed by a gnat, when the three worlds can be\nfound in the space of the hollow of an atom, when the fire which burns a straw\nshall last for a long time, when the objects seen in a dream shall come in the\nwaking state, when the current of a river shall stand still (of itself), when\nthe delivery of a barren woman shall be fruitful, when the crow shall walk\nlike a swan, when the mule shall fight with a lion, when a great ass shall\nwalk like an elephant, when the full moon shall become a sun, when R\xc4\x81hu (one\nof the nodes) shall abandon the sun and the moon, when a good crop shall arise\nout of the\n\np. 104\n\nwaste (burnt) seeds, when the poor shall enjoy the happiness of the rich, when\nthe lions shall be conquered by the bravery of dogs, when the heart of J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xabs\nis known by fools, when the ocean is drunk by the dogs without any remainder,\nwhen the pure \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b shall fall upon men, when heaven shall fall on the earth,\nwhen the flower in the sky shall emit fragrance, when a forest appearing in\npure \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b shall move, and when reflection shall arise in a glass simply\n(without mercury or anything else in its back), then the world really is.\nThere is no universe in the womb of Aja (the unborn Brahman)--there is no\nuniverse in the womb of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma. Duality and non-duality, which are but the\nresults of differentiation, are really not. All this is the result of m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81.\nTherefore, there should be Brahma-Bh\xc4\x81van\xc4\x81. If misery should arise from the\nconception of \'I am the body,\' then it is certain \'I am Brahman.\' The knot of\nthe heart is the wheel of Brahman, which cuts asunder the knot of existence.\nWhen doubt arises in one, he should have faith in Brahman. That non-dual\nBrahman, which is eternal and of the form of unconditioned bliss, is the guard\nof \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 against the chief of the form of not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Through instances like the\nabove is established the nature of Brahman. Brahman alone is the all-abode.\nAbandon the name even of the universe. Knowing for certain \'I am Brahman,\'\ngive up the \'I\'. Everything disappears as the flower from the hands of a\nsleeping person. There is neither body nor karma. Everything is Brahman alone.\nThere are neither objects, nor actions, nor the four states. Everything which\nhas the three characteristics of vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is Brahman alone. Abandoning all\naction, contemplate \'I am Brahman,\' \'I am Brahman\'. There is no doubt of this.\nI am Brahman of the nature of chi\xe1\xb9\xad. I am of the nature of Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da.\n\n"This great science of \xc5\x9aa\xe1\xb9\x85kara should never be explained to any ordinary\nperson, to an atheist or to a faithless, ill-behaved or evil-minded person. It\nshould be, after due examination, given to the high-souled ones whose minds\nare purified with devotion to their gurus. It should be taught for a year and\na half. Leaving off thoroughly and entirely the practice\n\np. 105\n\nrecommended by the (other) Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds, one should study the \xe1\xb9\xacejobin\xe1\xb8\x8du-\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d always with delight. By once studying it, he becomes one with\nBrahman. Thus ends the sixth chapter. Thus ends the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[78:1](tmu14.htm#fr_54) \xe1\xb9\xacejas is spiritual light and bin\xe1\xb8\x8du is seed; hence the\nseed or source of spiritual light.\n\n[78:2](tmu14.htm#fr_55) This probably refers to the triangle appearing in the\ndisciples.\n\n[79:1](tmu14.htm#fr_56) All these parts of yoga are explained here from the\nstandpoint of ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada.\n\n[82:1](tmu14.htm#fr_57) Sanaka is one of the four Kum\xc4\x81ras in the Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as who\nrefused to create; Suka is the son of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8da-Vy\xc4\x81s.\n\n[82:2](tmu14.htm#fr_58) The Kum\xc4\x81ra is the son of \xc5\x9aiva called K\xc4\x81r\xe1\xb9\xadik\xc4\x93ya the\nsix-faced, symbolising the six-faced Mars in one sense.\n\n[86:1](tmu14.htm#fr_59) Sesha, meaning remainder is the serpent representing\ntime.\n\n[93:1](tmu14.htm#fr_60) Herein is given the hint as to the difference of\nfunctions between an Ishta-\xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81 and a Guru.\n\n[95:1](tmu14.htm#fr_61) The four moving considerations (of ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada) are\nsubject (Brahman), object, relationship, and the qualified person.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13.
