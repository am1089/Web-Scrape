When he got\nthere, he took the body with the goblin in it on his shoulder, and started off\nin silence. And as he walked along, the goblin said to him again: "O King, you\nmust be very tired, coming and going in the night. So to amuse you I will tell\nanother story. Listen."\n\n\n\nThere is a city called Patna, the gem of the earth. And long ago a king lived\nthere whose name was Lion-of-Victory. Fate had made him the owner of all\nvirtues and all wealth. And he had a parrot called Jewel-of-Wisdom, that had\ndivine intelligence and knew all the sciences, but lived as a parrot because\nof a curse.\n\nThis king had a son called Moon, and by the advice of the parrot this prince\nmarried the daughter of the king of the Magadha country; and her name was\nMoonlight. Now this princess had a thrush named Moony, who was like the\nparrot, because she had learning and intelligence. And the parrot and the\nthrush lived in one cage in the palace.\n\nOne day the parrot eagerly said to the thrush: "My darling, love me, and share\nmy bed and my chair and my food and my amusements."\n\nBut the thrush said: "I will have nothing to do with men. Men are bad and\nungrateful."\n\nThen the parrot said: "Men are not bad. It is only women who are bad and\ncruel-hearted." And they quarrelled.\n\nThen the two birds wagered their freedom with each other and went to the\nprince to have their quarrel decided. And the prince mounted his father\'s\njudgment throne, and when he had heard the cause of the quarrel, he asked the\nthrush: "How are men ungrateful? Tell the truth." Then she said, "Listen, O\nPrince," and to prove her point she started to tell this story illustrating\nthe faults of men.\n\nThere is a famous city called Kamandaki, where a wealthy merchant lived named\nFortune. And in time a son was born to him and named Treasure. Then when the\nfather went to heaven, the young man became very unruly because of gambling\nand other vices. And the rascals came together, and ruined him. Association\nwith scoundrels is the root from which springs the tree of calamity.\n\nSo in no long time he lost all he had through his vices, and being ashamed of\nhis poverty, he left his own country and went to wander in other places. And\nduring his travels he came to a city called Sandal City, and entered the house\nof a merchant, seeking something to eat. When the merchant saw the youth, he\nasked him about his family, and finding that he was a gentleman, he\nentertained him. And thinking that Gate had sent the young man, he gave him\nhis own daughter Pearl, together with some money. And when Treasure was\nmarried, he lived in his father-in-law\'s house.\n\nAs time passed, he forgot his former miseries in the comforts of his life, and\nlonged for the old vices, and wanted to go home. So the rascal managed to\npersuade his father-in-law, who had no other children, took his wife Pearl\nwith her beautiful ornaments, and an old woman, and started for his own\ncountry. Presently he came to a wood where he said he was afraid of thieves,\nso he took all his wife\'s ornaments. Perceive, O Prince, how cruel and hard\nare  the ungrateful hearts of those who indulge in gambling and other vices.\nAnd the scoundrel was ready, just for money, to kill his good wife. He threw\nher and the old woman into a pit. Then the rascal went away and the old woman\nperished there.\n\nBut Pearl, with the little life she had left, managed to get out by clinging\nto the grass and bushes, and weeping bitterly, and bleeding, she asked the way\nstep by step, and painfully reached her father\'s house by the way she had\ncome. And her mother and father were surprised and asked her: "Why did you\ncome back so soon, and in this condition?"\n\nAnd that good wife said: "On the road we were robbed, and my husband was\nforcibly carried off. And the old woman fell into a pit and died, but I\nescaped. And a kind-hearted traveller pulled me from the pit." Then her father\nand mother were saddened, but they comforted her, and Pearl stayed there, true\nto her husband.\n\nThen in time Treasure lost all his money in gambling, and he reflected: "I\nwill get more money from the house of my father-in-law. I will go there and\ntell my father-in-law that his daughter is well and is at my house."\n\nSo he went again to his father-in-law. And as he went, his ever-faithful wife\nsaw him afar off. She ran and fell at the rascal\'s feet and told him all the\nstory that she had invented for her parents. For the heart of a faithful wife\ndoes not change even when she learns that her husband is a rogue.\n\nThen that rascal went without fear into the house of his father-in-law and\nbowed low before his feet. And his father-in-law rejoiced when he saw him and\nmade a great feast with his relatives, for he said: "My son is delivered alive\nfrom the robbers. Heaven be praised!" Then Treasure enjoyed the wealth of his\nfather-in-law and lived with his wife Pearl.\n\nNow one night this worst of scoundrels did what I ought not to repeat, but I\nwill tell it, or my story would be spoiled. Listen, O Prince. While Pearl lay\nasleep trusting him, that wretch killed her in the night, stole all her\njewels, and escaped to his own country. This shows how bad and ungrateful men\nare.\n\nWhen the thrush had told her story, the prince smiled and said to the parrot:\n"It is your turn now."\n\nThen the parrot said: "Your Majesty, women are cruel and reckless and bad. To\nprove it, I will tell you a story. Listen."\n\nThere is a city called Joyful, where lived a prince of merchants named Virtue,\nwho owned millions of money. He had a daughter named Fortune, peerless in\nbeauty, dearer to him than life. And she was given in marriage to a merchant\'s\nson from Copper City, whose name was Ocean. He was her equal in wealth,\nbeauty, and family; a delight to the eyes of men.\n\nOne day when her husband was away from home, she saw from the window a\nhandsome young man. And the moment she saw him, the fickle girl went mad with\nlove, and secretly sent a messenger to invite him in, and made love to him in\nsecret. Thus her heart was fixed on him alone, and she was happy with him.\n\nBut at last her husband came home and delighted the hearts of his parents-in-\nlaw. And when the day had been spent in feasting, Fortune was adorned by her\nmother, and sent to her husband\'s room. But she was cold toward him and\npretended to sleep. And her husband went to sleep, too, for he was weary with\nhis journey, and had been drinking wine.\n\nWhen everyone in the house had gone to sleep after their dinner, a thief made\na hole in the wall and came into that very room. And just then the merchant\'s\ndaughter got up without seeing him, and went out secretly to a meeting with\nher lover. And the thief was disappointed, and thought: "She has gone out into\nthe night wearing the very jewels that I came to steal. I must see where she\ngoes." So the thief went out and followed her.\n\nBut she met a woman friend who had flowers in her hand, and went to a park not\nvery far away. And there she saw the man whom she came to meet hanging on a\ntree. For the policeman had thought he was a thief, had put a rope around his\nneck and hanged him.\n\nAnd at the sight she went distracted, and lamented pitifully: "Oh, oh! I am\nundone," and fell on the ground and wept. Then she took her lover down from\nthe tree and made him sit up, though he was dead, and adorned him with\nperfumes and jewels and flowers.\n\nBut when in her love-madness she lifted his face and kissed him, a goblin who\nhad come to live in her dead lover, bit off her nose. And she was startled and\nran in pain from the spot. But then she came back to see if perhaps he was\nalive after all. But the goblin had gone, and she saw that he was motionless\nand dead. So she slowly went back home, frightened and disgraced and weeping.\n\nAnd the concealed thief saw it all and thought: "What has the wicked woman\ndone? Alas! Can women be so dreadful as this? What might she not do next?" So\nout of curiosity the thief still followed her from afar.\n\nAnd the wretched woman entered the house and cried aloud, and said: "Save me\nfrom my cruel enemy, my own husband. He cut off my nose and I had done\nnothing." And her servants heard her cries and all arose in excitement. Her\nhusband too awoke. Then her father came and saw that her nose was cut off, and\nin his anger he had his son-in-law arrested.\n\nAnd the poor man did not know what to do. Even when he was being bound, he\nremained silent and said nothing. Then they all woke up and heard the story,\nbut the thief who knew the whole truth, ran away. And when day came, the\nmerchant\'s son was haled before the king by his father-in-law. And Fortune\nwent there without her nose, and the king heard the whole story and condemned\nthe merchant\'s son to death for mistreating his wife.\n\nSo the innocent, bewildered man was led to the place of execution and the\ndrums were beaten. Just then the thief came up and said to the king\'s men:\n"Why do you kill this man without any good reason? I know how the whole thing\nhappened. Take me to the king, and I will tell all."\n\nSo all the king\'s men took him to the king. And the thief told the king all\nthe adventures of the night, and said: "Your Majesty, if you cannot trust my\nword, you may find the nose at this moment between the teeth of the dead\nbody."\n\nThen the king sent men to investigate, and when he found it was true, he\nreleased the merchant\'s son from the punishment of death. As for wretched\nFortune, he cut off her ears, too, and banished her from the country. And he\ntook from her father, the merchant, all his money, and made the thief the\nchief of police. He was pleased with him.\n\nO Prince, this shows how cruel and false women are by nature.\n\nAs he spoke these words, the parrot changed into a god, for the curse was\nfulfilled, and went to heaven like a god. And the thrush suddenly became a\ngoddess, for her curse was at an end, and flew up likewise to heaven. So their\ndispute was never settled at that court.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story, he asked the king: "O King, tell me. Are\nmen bad, or women? If you know and do not tell, your head will fly to pieces."\nAnd when the king heard these words of the goblin on his shoulder, he said to\nthat magic goblin: "O goblin! Here and there, now and then, there is an\noccasional bad man like that. But women are usually bad. We hear about many of\nthem."\n\nThen the goblin disappeared from the king\'s shoulder as before. And the king\ntried again to catch him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fourth Goblin: King Shudraka and Hero\'s Family. Which of the five\ndeserves the most honour?](ttg05.htm)\n\n'
