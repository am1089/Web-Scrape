What can there be beyond this?\n\n601\n\nThe writing written by the hand perishes (spoil) not though thou blot it out\n(spoil it). What is written by fate cannot be done away even with water. The\nwriting of fate in the forehead will not be gone though thou rub it with\nsorrow.\n\n602\n\np. 149\n\nHow should this animal life become assimilated with God? Shall we compare a\nvillage cur with a sage (or saint, yogee).\n\n603\n\nTo the liberal man, the vessels of the [mundane](errata.htm#91) egg will fall\ninto his hand. The demigods will become his dependants. Liberality becomes the\nresidence of all modes of knowledge. Through liberality no grief can befall us\nin the world.\n\n604\n\nBehold, if thou say not, if thou refuse not, if thou oppose not, if thou\ndislike it not, if thou say it is not thine, that which is thus given is\nliberality.\n\n605\n\nIf thou reproach others (abhor), if thou esteem not strangers as thy\nrelations, ignorant of what of what is right and wrong and lay not hold of\nheaven (phrase, be puffed up). the liberality thus bestowed is no liberality--\nit is hoarding up.\n\n606\n\nThose who grind (i.e.; plough) for the good of others, those also that are\ndependants on princes--these are the men who are like milk and payer of taxes;\nthe farmers are ignorant of language.\n\np. 150\n\n607\n\nThough they be greatest of misers and hard and thou full of mischief, an evil\ndoer when he boils over a cupful must be skimmed off. But they should not be\ncalled causers of the death of others. (That is, pride should be checked just\nenough to render it harmless.)\n\n608\n\nA degraded caste is a caste that has set aside all\n[distinctions](errata.htm#92); the tribe sustains all creatures. Those who are\nof such a caste both here and in the next world are the Universal prop. (the\nfarmer tribe)\n\n609\n\nThe endless cupidity of merchant, the fruitless showers on the rocks, the\ninterminate search made in the sea, the insurpassable light of the moon and to\nthese there is no end. There is no path (to heaven) to the man of impure\nspeech.\n\n610\n\np. 151\n\nThe sin committed by a people shall fall on their prince; about half of the\ngood done by the prince shall come to the people. How then is it that the sins\nof the prince fall not on the people?\n\n611\n\n[Would](errata.htm#93) thou you were to look on a cow with affection like the\naffection with which you view a woman. The man is so much drawn by merit as by\n[pleasure](errata.htm#94). What can we think of the conduct of a sinner.\n\n612\n\nAll the [excommunication](errata.htm#95) of a Brahmin departs by the (\n_amrita_ ) products of the cow (panchagavyam). The faults of a servant are\nremoved only by punishment. The impurity (menstrual) of the _Lingayath_ is all\nremoved by mere smearing with ashes.\n\n613\n\nA dog knows its own mind, pleased with it. But a man knows not it his own\nwishes or nature nor can see them in this iron age.\n\n614\n\np. 152\n\nThe frauds (lies) of a woman are impenetrable as a wall. A man\'s fraud is but\na grass screen (tatty). The arts of women are ceaseless as the voice of a\ncricket.\n\n615\n\nHe who holds as his own the afflictions that befall others is the man who\nshall remain and live in the earth. He who knows the next world well is the\ngreatest of the noble in this earth.\n\n616\n\nThe stony hearted wretch though be cut his body to pieces, yet will not give a\npenny; if you wish for a cow at his hands can you get it? It is vain as\nlonging for gold buried under a hill.\n\n617\n\nThe born villain, who through friendship (covetousness) that originates in\nwealth; knows neither himself nor his neighbour, not seeing out of his eyes\nwith all pride; to go and beg of such a fool is all hard indeed.\n\n618\n\nSo hard a wretch becomes the possession of the flame. The life (man) void of\nkindness shall waste away in water; the soul full of cruelty shall be the\nportion of cruel plunderers.\n\np. 158\n\n619\n\nHe who the [worthless](errata.htm#96) wretch who after daily exciting at hopes\nlast says I cannot give it, his life is like to a radish. At last he loses all\npower and waits for the favour of others.\n\n620\n\nThey who compare the breasts of an young woman to balls of flowers--the\nworthless wretches who are captivated in this earth. There is [a\nlump](errata.htm#97) of flesh there--what else is there?\n\n621\n\nHe who lives after losing his [character](errata.htm#98) be he who he may, can\nhe have any distinction? What dog will not lick a dirty dish (spittle leaf)?\n\n622\n\nFools cry for food, food, If they cannot get wealth. Can they procure food?\nHow should you fail of food if you have wealth--however many scarcities should\noccur.\n\n623\n\np. 154\n\nWhen a man has lost his refuge let him not draw near to one in poverty. But he\nshould go to him, he will turn him into a mere straw (with which platters are\nserved) or into ashes.\n\n624\n\nOne cannot give his sorrow to another; nor one can share his happiness with\nanother. Those who feel either sorrow or good cannot know its intrinsic\nqualities (lit. semblance). Surely time (Pluto) shall know their true nature.\n\n625\n\nHitherto ignorant to a miracle of what he himself is doing, born as a man yet\nunknowing both evil and good, he has sunk down to predication,\n\n626\n\nLike as honey is produced in a hillock (or ant-hill), like as a ruby is\nproduced on hill, like as fire is produced in a stick--thus produced in the\nearth; let a man bestow on others.\n\n627\n\nOf what use is the man who when the wearied guest asks food compounds not for\nhim, the nine condiments with salt, to quench his exhaustion. The disappointed\nguest remains unfilled.\n\np. 155\n\n628\n\nThey call the crow the most degraded of birds. None perceiveth the excellence\nof the crow in the earth. Man gives food to the crows and worships their feet.\n(This alludes to a practice of commencing a meal by giving a morsel to the\ncrows.)\n\n629\n\nThey say that the crow is the most degraded of birds. At the time of marriages\nthey will not let the crow approach. Then why do you place food before it and\nsalute it?\n\n630\n\nLike a boy looking at his shadow, who looking at his shadow forgetting\nhimself, so are those deluded creatures who looking on their shadow call\nthemselves kings. What shall we think of such fools?\n\n631\n\nThe stone hearted hunter, who severs the mothers and the young of creatures\nthat have heads (fruits are considered as animals void of heads)--when this\nhunter dies in the earth, when he falls on the ground, he shall be, of no use\neven to vultures.\n\n632\n\np. 156\n\nWere not they born as ourselves in the earth? Have they not a life like ours?\nOh! what an act is it to slay an anima! that has instinct (or reason, jyana).\n\n633\n\nThe great whole continues in one mind. Their madness alone prevents men from\nknowing this. If thou walk in the knowledge of him that is our abode--it is\nenough.\n\n634\n\nUnknowing the path of thy future life (transmigrations) and if thou consider\nall thy enjoyments as permanent thou shall be [separated](errata.htm#99) like\na fish from the water. In the end none but this shall be thy fate; thou shalt\nmelt and perish.\n\n635\n\nHe who though reviled or struck answers not again who looks neither this way\nnor that nor starts nor will consider himself the person in question nor is\nany way agitated--such a man becomes the Divinity.\n\n636\n\np. 157\n\nLearn to know that great agent of all acts, O! Vema who wieldeth the thunder\nbolt, cleareth it from impurity and with its ultimate essence (i.e.. nectar,\npure water) now fishes the iron age\n\n637\n\nThe attachment between the teacher and the learner is very deceitful, Why\nshould we explain or shew it. With subdued longing after beatitude if ye have\nfull faith, thou shalt attain it and not otherwise.\n\n638\n\nWhen snakes are performing coition, you may catch them cleverly (unrivalled)\nand in a wonderful [manner](errata.htm#100). But you cannot get the obstinate\ntogether and seize them with a prepared heart.\n\n638\n\nConsider fully the strength of thy shoulder and dispute not with the wile. Is\nnot a stone broken by a pot of milk? (Boiled milk is set to cool on stone\nstands which thereby are split).\n\n640\n\np. 158\n\nWhere in the earth is the place where he is not beheld? He exists in\neverything. Who am I; who is he that I am not--know this truth, O Vema.\n\n641\n\nHe who bestows either his own property or that of others shall become rich.\nThen let him think why he should entertain the smallest fear; ultimately\nheaven shall be his.\n\n642\n\nIf he does good to others and gives the property of one to another (res\nalienas alieno si det) he shall inherit heaven. Is wealth anything in\ncomparison with heaven?\n\n643\n\nWhat is the nourishment of others to the wicked? The sinner transgresses the\nlines both of regularity and affinity. What does obstinate know of the clues\nof tenderness, what distinction can such a one attain in this earth?\n\n644\n\np. 159\n\nIn those who prosper in their undertakings may distinguish themselves with a\nwaste of words in any matter, but in a time when you are not in favour, no one\nwork will prosper with you, however large your possessions be.\n\n645\n\nBe he an out caste or of any tribe whatever, he cannot rid himself of poverty.\nWill the poor man be disgusted at leaving?\n\n646\n\nThe man of prudence who has bestowed the gift of land on Brahmins (observe\nscansion) and his heart on his dependents and who has (given half to) slighted\nthe worthless, how brave is he?\n\n647\n\nThe man that understanding all wisdom commits of his wealth, one share to the\nearth, one to others and one to the poor who thus shines, he, when he dies\nshall dwell in heaven.\n\n648\n\np. 160\n\nThe woman who [holds](errata.htm#101) her [husband\'s](errata.htm#102) words\n[as](errata.htm#103) the chief good and who loves her lord with affection\nshall by burning her body fully inherit heaven.\n\n649\n\nThose senseless [corpses](errata.htm#104) who give alms to the re-born who\nhave [separated](errata.htm#105) themselves from dung and urine, these shall\nbe produced again weeping and in sin nor released from transmigration.\n(Spurious)\n\n650\n\nHe who after having been imprisoned in the ties of oxen, wealth, women and\nsons, is the agent in releasing himself, there from, can his glory on his\nvirtue be comprehended even by (Sridhara) Vishnu? (Spurious)\n\n651\n\nThese sinful men who having it in their power to give up the restraints of\ntheir children, women, cattle will not yet cast off these ties, these are void\nof shame and of manhood. (Spurious)\n\n652\n\np. 161\n\nThe whole race of man is in possession of twelve fruits. (that is, men receive\nin the next birth twelve percent on the sums they bestow in alms). But\nwhatever they bestow on Brahmins shall return to them with [thirty\nsix](errata.htm#106) percent. (evidently apocryphal)\n\n653\n\nHe who when the land he had bestowed is lost, bestows other land instead on\nthe original tenant, thus shall form a great blessing to the agent in such an\nact.\n\n654\n\nIf the [possessor](errata.htm#107) loses his possession, this is no fault of\nthe bestower. If the holder enjoys the gift, the giver hence derives\nstability.\n\n655\n\nHe who usurps from the Gods, the Brahmin, the poet or the adulator, the gift\nbestowed either by himself or others, and grieve them, this man shall live\ntill he devour dung without measure. (evidently apocryphal)\n\n656\n\np. 162\n\nTo devour a mortgage or the fruits of such a possession is a great sin though\nthe committer be a king. The tenant alone has the right to the usufruct, to\nthe exclusion of the land lord.\n\n657\n\nHe who mortgages, suffers a certain loss, he loses part of his living. The\nacceptor of the pledge derives satisfaction therefrom. But he is ruined if he\nbegins to covet it.\n\n658\n\nThey who recognize (pity not) the nature of the [irrational](errata.htm#108)\n(uneducated) animals and contrive how to take mortgages from them, these are\nthemselves the most brutish in the earth.\n\n659\n\nThe thing that is nourished with _vasa_ herb is poisoned by the _vasa-nabhi_ ,\nwhich also secures the body from _venom_ ; if thou comprehend this thou shalt\nbecome him who knows the secrets of the heart.\n\n660\n\nIgnorant of the chief good, void of sense, he sinks in darkness. That saint\nwho is perfect shall know all the great secret.\n\np. 163\n\n661\n\nHe is a fool who gives his hand to another in assurance of security while he\nhimself is transient as a figure in a mirror; void of happiness why should we\ncontract marriage in this fleeting life?\n\n662\n\nWhat wisdom can he have who knoweth not knowledge? The fool never shall know\nGod. What is the chief God (tatwa) to know the wisdom that is\n[within](errata.htm#109) wisdom?\n\n663\n\nDwelling in the false earth, unable to reach heaven, grieving in their\nmembers, enduring sever penance-never shall these see happiness (tatwa).\n\n664\n\nA man of the sea may go to sleep with another. Know that an entire creation\nexists in the vast deep.\n\n685\n\nThis world being continued by means of birth, death and sleep--a man\'s calling\nhimself (observe grammar) a jangam therein, is not understood by any of the\nignorant men of the earth. (i.e., ignorant recognize not holiness)\n\np. 164\n\n666\n\nWater is changed into the body and the body into water and into immutable\nmatter. This does the entire world of being exist in water.\n\n687\n\nIf even a boil rise on the back of a man of virtue, it will become notorious.\nBut if even a marriage happen in the house of a poor man, no one hears of it.,\n\n668\n\nWhat you call the Goddess of the earth is mere clay. How many fair beings are\nborn from the earth that Goddess alone knows, but no man knows the origin.\n\n669\n\nThey, heap up earth and wallow in mud but they adhere not to the earth but\nturn again, and are mingled with earth. Where shall they then depart to?\n\n670\n\nThe scamp who cannot give up connection with a _Viti_ woman (of the sword-\nplaying caste) will carry about her mat and hovel (or tent) till death. Never\ncare or aspire to an intimacy with the _Bhagavat_ (actors who are\nrespectable).\n\np. 165\n\n671\n\nWhen they behold their refuge Vishnu or wealth, or studies that have pleasing\ntaste however great they be, all men feel desire.\n\n672\n\nA man who is sent (lit. who sent) into the world, hear me, consider not one\nthing eternal and another temporal; such is his conduct. His projects\nconstitute his family; and the destruction of his projects shall form the\nultimate bliss.\n\n673\n\nThe words of truth are equal in excellence with the streams in which Siva is;\n( _abhisheca_ ) bathed. The body is his temple. He who hath attained peace and\nplaced with God in his soul, this is the Siva Yogi.\n\n674\n\nNo numbers of corporal bodies form an obstacle to a death. To what end is that\nknowledge that teaches not how to avoid death; this is mere thievish fraud.\nShall salvation be hereby attained?\n\np. 166\n\n675\n\nWhatever shape we behold, it shows thy form. To view thy form increases\nwisdom; if understanding increase, a man is held to be the lord.\n\n676\n\nCarnudu was noble; who in the world is greater? He meditated bestowing gifts,\nno man knows of the excellence of him who doth no good to others.\n\n677\n\nIgnorant of the stability of wisdom the variable mortal roams the world. The\nignorant wretch cannot consider why it is he thus roams.\n\n678\n\nWhen a man does not know what to do with his time, he cannot get on without\nlistening to some learning or other. But this is fruitless; famina not audit\nmurmura cassor inter futuendum?\n\n679\n\nTo what end do the men of the earth practise austerity and meditation? There\nbut one mode to behold God. Let not thy mind wander and thou shalt know him.\n\np. 167\n\n680\n\nWhat has palm toddy to do with gentle behaviour; why all this care about\nappearances that are merely with a view to gaining bread? To what end is this\nbody, which is [destined](errata.htm#110) to the earth of the\n[cemetery](errata.htm#111).\n\n681\n\nIf you powder nitre and tulasi (buds) together, amalgamate then upon gold; mix\nthe milk of the dushta plant and mingle these upon a plate of copper which\nwill thus become gold.\n\n682\n\nIf thou pour milk in and boil it the tin will shine. If thou observe the\nproper moment and take it off the fire, it will turn to silver. This is no lie\nbut the truth, Iswara.\n\n683\n\nIf thou take a certain medicine thou shalt be able to rise from the earth; if\nthou take a certain mixture thou shalt be glorious. There is also a drug that\nquelleth fever.\n\n684\n\np. 168\n\nCattle that fall down in the staggers if they are fired and thus come to life\nagain. Shall the milk of fired [buffalo](errata.htm#112) be held vile.\n\n685\n\nIf he receive great wealth, he forbears to take it; he reviles the respectable\nand drives them off till they fly. Will a cow of degraded blood acknowledge\nthe noble?\n\n686\n\nNumerous as creeds be they are not permanent in the earth. Truth is but one in\nthe earth. It consists in leaving every creed and [beholding](errata.htm#113)\nthe very deity.\n\n687\n\nIn the real composition (lit. rising) of a cloud within the cloud there is\nthunder [and](errata.htm#114) thunderbolts in abundance. Then to understand\nwhat "cloud" implies and the might embodied in it is great task (revise).\n\n688\n\nIf a seed be damaged, it cannot grow; if the seed be not injured, it grows.\nThen surely the seed alone is Viswakarma, the creator.\n\np. 169\n\n689\n\nThough you hear of him, be not thou ever united to him, If thou see and unite\nwith him, your desires will unite in affection. If from merely hearing of him\nthou be united to him, your love will depart. Such is love that originates in\n[hearsay](errata.htm#115) and sight.\n\n[690](errata.htm#116)\n\nThe [humility](errata.htm#117) of a mad man is great. The widow when ruined\nveils herself, and the son of a prostitute performs the rites very duly.\n\n691\n\nHe is a mental wax cloth (changeless) and a cave formed by bowed banyan trees.\nThis farmer Vemana took all men and taught them well; thus did he gain renown.\n\n692\n\nA guana will live a century, a serpent will creep for ten centuries, and the\ncrane will live in a pond for a thousand years. He who possesses man\'s chief\ngood (wisdom) is the only excellent one.\n\np. 170\n\n693\n\nIf they say he knows not, surely he had no knowledge previously. If he begins\nto say I know, he knows the root. Let the mouth of him who says I know, when\nhe knows not, be filled with a basket of ashes.\n\n694\n\n(Observe comparative) The dog has somewhat a better quality than man; for if\nwe consider man in the world he is worse than a dog, if he be void of\nexcellence.\n\n695\n\nA shop keeper\'s devotion well, never turn to any use. Through a covetous\ndisposition he sinks downwards. It is as agreeable as tiger entertaining a\nsaint.\n\n696\n\nA dome, ponds all about, cars and herb gardens, temples---all these are very\nfair. But if you go to serve the God, all these divert the mind.\n\n697\n\np. 171\n\nUntil married, they are in subjection. When the cord (about the throat) is\nbound, they look scornfully. To be in subjection under woman is a thing not to\nbe spoken of.\n\n698\n\nWhile the ears, skin and bright eyes, the tongue and nose continue, the soul\nremains; the spirit thus dwelling firmly in the body shines as the chief thing\nin the world.\n\n699\n\nWhat our own history will be and what those of our connections will be, if we\nwish to hear or see this futurity, the Gods [themselves](errata.htm#118) know\nit not.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 700-799](vov09.htm)\n\n'
