Griffith, [1899], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 87\n\n### BOOK THE ELEVENTH.\n\nHARNESSING, first of all, the mind, Savitar having stretched  \nthe thought  \nWith reverent look upon the light of Agni bore them up  \nfrom earth.  \n2 By impulse of God Savitar we with our spirit harnessed strive  \nWith might to win the heavenly.  \n3 Savitar, having harnessed Gods who go to light and heavenly  \nthought,  \nWho will create the lofty light\xc2\x97Savitar urge them on their  \nway!  \n4 The priests of him the lofty priest well skilled in hymns,  \nharness their spirit, yea, harness their holy thoughts.  \nHe only, skilled in rules, assigns their priestly tasks. Yea,  \nlofty is the praise of Savitar the God.  \n5 I yoke with prayer your ancient inspiration: may the laud  \nrise as on the prince's pathway.  \nAll Sons of the Immortal One shall hear it, who have resorted  \nto celestial dwellings.\n\np. 88\n\n6 Even he, the God whose going forth and majesty the other  \nDeities have followed with their might,  \nHe who hath measured the celestial regions out by his great  \npower, he is the Courser Savitar.  \n7 Our sacrifice, God Savitar! speed forward: speed to his share  \nthe sacrifice's patron.  \nMay the celestial Gandharva, Cleanser of thought and will,  \nmake clean our thoughts and wishes.  \nThe Lord of Speech sweeten the words we utter!  \n8 God Savitar, speed this God-loved sacrifice of ours,  \nfriend-finding, ever-conquering, winning wealth and heaven.  \nSpeed praise-song with the sacred verse, Rathantara with  \nGayatra, Brihat that runs in Gayatra. All-hail!  \n9 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee, with arms of Asvins,  \nwith the hands of Pushan, in Angiras\xc2\x92 manner, with  \nGayatri metre.  \nFrom the earth's seat bring thou Purishya Agni, as Angiras  \nwas wont, with Trishtup metre.  \n10 Spade art thou; woman art thou. Ours be power with thee  \nto dig out Agni in his dwelling, as Angiras was wont, with  \nJagati metre.  \n11 Savitar, bearing in his hand the gold spade which he took  \ntherewith,  \nLooking with reverence on the light of Agni, raised it from  \nthe earth,  \nWith the Anushtup metre and as Angiras was wont to do.  \n12 Run hither, urged to speed, O Horse, along the most extended  \nspace.\n\np. 89\n\nThy loftiest birthplace is in heaven. thy navel is in air's  \nmid-realm, the womb that bare thee is on earth.  \n13 Upon this course, O lords of wealth, harness; ye twain, the  \nAss who bears  \nAgni, and kindly favours us.  \n14 In every need, in every race we call, as friends, to succour us,  \nIndra, the mightiest of all.  \n15 Come speeding on and trampling imprecations; come  \ngladdening to the chieftainship of Rudra.  \nSpeed through the wide air thou whose paths are pleasant,  \nwith Pushan for thy mate, providing safety.  \n16 From the Earth's seat, like Anginas, bring thou Purishya  \nAgni forth.  \nAfter the wont of Angiras we to Purishya Agni go.  \nAgni Purishya we will bear after the went of Angiras.  \n17 Agni hath looked along the van of Mornings, looked on the  \ndays, the earliest Jatavedas,  \nAnd many a time along the beams of Surya: along the heaven  \nand earth hast thou extended.  \n18 The Courser, started on his way, shakes from him all hostilities.  \nHe longs to look with reverent eye on Agni is the mighty.  \nseat.\n\np. 90\n\n19 O Courser, having come to earth, seek Agni with a longing  \nwish.  \nTell us by trampling on the ground where we may dig him  \nfrom the earth.  \n20 Heaven is thy back, the earth thy seat, the air thy soul,  \nthe sea thy womb.  \nLooking around thee with thine eye trample the adversaries  \ndown.  \n21 Wealth-giver, Courser, from this place step forth to great  \nfelicity.  \nMay we enjoy Earth's favour while we dig forth Agni from  \nher  \n22 Down hath he stepped, wealth-giver, racer, courser. Good  \nand auspicious room on earth thou madest.  \nThence let us dig forth Agni, fair to look on, while to the  \nloftiest vault we mount, to heaven.  \n23 I thoughtfully besprinkle thee with butter, thee dwelling  \nnear to all existing creatures.  \nBroad, vast through vital power that moves transversely,  \nconspicuous, strong with all the food that feeds thee.  \n24 I sprinkle him who moves in all directions: may he accept  \nit with a friendly spirit.  \nAgni with bridegroom's face and lovely colour may not be  \ntouched when all his form is fury.  \n25 Round the oblation bath he paced, Agni the wise, the Lord  \nof Strength,  \nGiving the offerer precious boons.  \n26 We set thee round us as a fort, victorious Agni, thee a Sage,  \nOf hero lineage, day by day destroyer of our treacherous foes.  \n27 Thou, Agni, with the days, fain to shine hitherward, art  \nbrought to life from out the waters, from the stone,\n\np. 91\n\nFrom out the forest trees and herbs that grow on ground.  \nthou, Sovran Lord of men, art generated pure.  \n28 At Savitar's, the Shining One's, impulsion, with arms of  \nAsvins and with hands of Pushan,  \nAs Angiras was wont to do, I dig thee forth from the seat  \nof Earth, Agni Purishya.  \nThee, Agni, luminous and fair of aspect, resplendent with  \nimperishable lustre, gracious to living creatures, never  \nharming,  \nAs Angiras was wont to do, we dig thee forth from the seat  \nof Earth, Agni Purishya.  \n29 Thou art the Waters\xc2\x92 back, the womb of Agni, around the  \nocean as it swells and surges.  \nWaxing to greatness, resting on the lotus, spread thou in  \namplitude with heaven's own measure.  \n30 Yea are a shelter and a shield, uninjured both, and widely  \nspread.  \nDo ye; expansive, cover him: bear ye Purishya Agni up.  \n31 Cover him, finders of the light, united both with breast and  \nself,  \nBearing between you Agni, the refulgent, everlasting One.  \n32 Thou art Purishya, thou support of all. Atharvan was the  \nfirst, Agni, who rubbed thee into life.  \nAgni, Atharvan brought thee forth by rubbing from the  \nlotus, from  \nThe head of Visva, of the Priest.  \n33 Thee too as Vritra-slayer, thee breaker of forts, the Sage  \nDadhyach,  \nSon of Atharvan, lighted up.\n\np. 92\n\n34 Pathya the Bull, too, kindled thee the Dasyus\xc2\x92 most  \ndestructive foe,  \nWinner of spoil in every fight.  \n35 Sit, Hotar, in the Hotar's place, observant: lay down the  \nsacrifice in the place of worship.  \nThou, dear to Go is, shalt serve them with oblation. Agni,  \ngive long life to the Sacrificer.  \n36 Accustomed to the Hotar's place, the Hotar hath seated him,  \nbright, splendid, passing mighty,  \nWhose foresight keeps the Law from violation, excellent,  \npure-tongued, bringing thousands, Agni.  \n37 Seat thee, for thou art mighty: shine, best entertainer of  \nthe Gods.  \nWorthy of sacred food, praised Agni! loose the smoke, ruddy  \nand beautiful to see.  \n38 Pour heavenly Waters honey-sweet here for our health, for  \nprogeny.  \nForth from the place whereon they fall let plants with goodly  \nberries spring.  \n39 May Vayu Matarisvan heal and comfort thy broken heart as  \nthere supine thou liest.  \nThou unto whom the breath of Gods gives motion, to Ka,  \nyea, unto thee, O God, be Vashat!  \n40 He, nobly born with lustre, shield and refuge, hath sat down  \nin light.  \nO Agni, Rich in Splendour, robe thyself in many-hued attire.  \n41 Lord of fair sacrifice; arise! With Godlike thought protect  \nus well.\n\np. 93\n\nWith great light splendid to behold come, Agni, through  \nsweet hymns of praise.  \n42 Rise up erect to give us aid, stand up like Savitar the God;  \nErect as strength-bestower when we call aloud, with unguents  \nand with priests on thee.  \n43 Thou, being horn, art Child of Earth and Heaven, parted, fair  \nBabe, among the plants, O Agni.  \nThe glooms of night thou, brilliant child, subduest, and art  \ncome forth, loud roaring, from the Mothers.  \n44 Steady be thou, and firm of limb. Steed, be a racer fleet of  \nfoot.  \nBroad be thou, pleasant as a seat, bearing the store which  \nAgni needs.  \n45 Be thou propitious, Angiras, to creatures of the human race.  \nSet not on fire the heaven and earth, nor air's mid-region,  \nnor the trees.  \n46 Forth with loud neighing go the Steed, the Ass that shouteth  \nas he runs.  \nBearing Purishya Agni on, let him not perish ere his time,  \nMale bearer of male Agni, Child of Waters, Offspring of the  \nSea. Agni, come hither to the feast.  \n47 The Law the Truth, the Law the Truth. As Angiras was  \nwont to do, we bear Purishya Agni on.  \nYe Plants, with joyous welcome greet this Agni, auspicious  \nOne who cometh on to meet you.  \nRemoving all distresses and afflictions, here settle down and  \nbanish evil purpose.\n\np. 94\n\n48 Welcome him joyfully, ye Plants, laden with bloom and  \ngoodly fruit.  \nThis seasonable Child of yours hath settled in his ancient  \nseat.  \n49 Resplendent with thy wide-extending lustre dispel the terrors  \nof the fiends who hate us.  \nMay lofty Agni be my guide and shelter, ready to hear our  \ncall, the good Protector.  \n50 Ye, Waters, are beneficent, so help ye us to energy  \nThat we may look on great delight.  \n51 Give us a portion of the sap, the most propitious that ye  \nhave.  \nLike mothers in their longing love.  \n52 To you we gladly come for him to whose abode ye lead us  \non:  \nAnd, Waters, give us procreant strength.  \n53 Mitra, having commingled earth and ground together with  \nthe light  \nFor health to creatures mix I thee Omniscient and nobly  \nborn.  \n54 The Rudras, having mixed the earth, set all aglow the lofty  \nlight.  \nBright and perpetual their light verily shines among the  \nGods.  \n55 The lump of clay that hath been mixed by Vasus, Rudras,  \nby the wise,  \nMay Sinivali with her hands soften and fit it for the work.  \n56 May Sinivali with fair braids, with beauteous crest, with  \nlovely locks,  \nMay she, O mighty Aditi, bestow the Fire-pan in thy hands.\n\np. 95\n\n57 Aditi shape the Fire-pan with her power, her arms, her  \nintellect,  \nAnd in her womb bear Agni as a mother, in her lap, her  \nson.  \n58 With Gayatri, like Angiras the Vasus form and fashion thee!  \nStedfast art then, thou art the Earth. Establish in me progeny,  \ncommand of cattle, growth of wealth, kinsmen for  \nme the worshipper.  \nWith Trishtup may the Rudras, like Angiras, form and  \nfashion thee.  \nStedfast art thou, thou art the Air. Establish in me, etc.,  \nas above.  \nWith Jagati, like Angiras, \xc3\x82dityas form and fashion thee!  \nStedfast art thou, thou art the Sky. Establish in me, etc.  \nFriends of all men, the All-Gods with Anushtup form thee  \nAngiras-like.  \nStedfast art thou, thou art the Quarters. Establish in me,  \netc.  \n59 The zone of Aditi art thou. Aditi seize thy hollow space.  \nShe, having made the great Fire-pan, a womb for Agni,  \nformed of clay,  \nAditi, gave it to her Sons and, Let them bake it, were her  \nwords.  \n60 The Vasus make thee fragrant, as Angiras did, with Gayatri!  \nThe Rudras make thee fragrant with the Trishtup, as did  \nAngiras!  \nWith Gayatri, like Angiras, may the \xc3\x82dityas perfume thee.  \nDear to all men, may the All-Gods with the Anushtup  \nsweeten thee, as Angiras was wont to do.  \nMay Indra make thee odorous. May Varuna make thee  \nodorous. May Vishnu make thee odorous.\n\np. 96\n\n61 Pit! Angiras-like may Aditi the Goddess, beloved by all  \nGods, dig thee in Earth's bosom.  \nPan! Angiras-like may the Gods\xc2\x92 heavenly Consorts, dear  \nto all Gads, in the Earth's bosom place thee.  \nPan! Angiras-like may Dhishanas, Divine Ones, dear to alt  \nGods, in the Earth's bosom light thee.  \nPan! Angiras-like may the divine Varutris, dear to all Gods,  \nin the earth's bosom heat thee,  \nPan! Angiras-like may the celestial Ladies, dear to all Gods,  \nin the earth's bosom bake thee.  \nAngiras-like may the celestial Matrons, beloved by all the  \nGods, with unclipped pinions, within the lap of Earth,  \nO Fire pan, bake thee.  \n62 The gainful grace of Mitra, God, supporter of the race of  \nman,  \nIs glorious, of most wondrous fame.  \n63 With lovely arms, with lovely hands, with lovely fingers  \nmay the God Savitar make thee clean, yea, by the power  \nbe hath.  \nNot trembling on the earth fill thou the regions, fill the  \nQuarters full.  \n64 Having arisen wax thou great, yea, stand thou up  \nimmovable.  \nTo thee, O Mitra, I entrust this Fire-pan for security. May  \nit remain without a break.  \n65 Thee may the Vasus, Angiras-like, fill with the metre  \nGayatri.  \nThee may the Rudras, Angiras-like, fill with the Trishtup  \nmetre full.\n\np. 97\n\nThee may \xc3\x82dityas, Angiras-like, fill with the metre Jagati.  \nWith the Anushtup metre may the All-Gods, dear to all  \nmen, fill thee full, as Angiras was wont.  \n66 Intention, Agni. Motive, Hail! Mind, Wisdom, Agni, Motive,  \nHail!  \nThought, Knowledge, Agni, Motive, Hail! Rule of Speech,  \nAgni, Motive, Hail!  \nTo Manu Lord of creatures, Hail! To Agni dear to all men,  \nHail!  \n67 May every mortal man elect the friendship of the guiding God.  \nEach one solicits him for wealth: let him seek fame to  \nprosper him. All-hail!  \n68 Break not, nor suffer any harm. Endure, O Mother, and  \nbe brave;  \nThis work will thou and Agni do.  \n69 Be firm for weal, O Goddess Earth. Made in the wonted  \nmanner thou  \nArt a celestial design.  \nAcceptable to Gods he this oblation. Arise thou in this  \nsacrifice uninjured.  \n70 Wood-fed, bedewed with sacred oil, ancient, Invoker,  \nexcellent,  \nThe Son of Strength, the Wonderful.  \n71 Abandoning the foeman's host, pass hither to this company:  \nAssist the men with whom I stand.  \n72 From the remotest distance come, Lord of the Red Steeds,  \nhitherward.  \nDo thou Purishya, Agni, loved of many, overcome our foes.\n\np. 98\n\n73 O Agni, whatsoever be the fuel that we lay on thee,  \nMay that he butter unto thee. Be pleased therewith, Most  \nYouthful God.  \n74 That which the termite eats away, that over which the  \nemmet crawls\xc2\x97  \nButter be all of this to thee. Be pleased therewith, Most  \nYouthful God.  \n75 Bringing to him, with care unceasing, fodder day after day  \nas to a stabled courser,  \nJoying in food and in the growth of riches, may we thy  \nneighbours, Agni, ne\xc2\x92er be injured.  \n76 While on earth's navel Agni is enkindled, we call, for  \nample increase of our riches,  \nOn Agni joying in the draught, much-lauded, worshipful;  \nvictor conquering in battle.  \n77 Whatever hosts there are, fiercely assailant, charging in  \nlengthened lines, drawn up in order,  \nWhatever thieves there are, whatever robbers, all these I  \ncast into thy mouth, O Agni.  \n78 Devour the burglars with both tusks, destroy the robbers  \nwith thy teeth.  \nWith both thy jaws, thou Holy One, eat up those thieves  \nwell champed and chewed.  \n79 The burglars living among men, the thieves and robbers in  \nthe wood,  \nCriminals lurking in their lairs, these do I lay between thy  \njaws.  \n80 Him who would seek to injure us, the man who looks oh  \nus with hate  \nTurn thou to ashes, and the man who slanders and would  \ninjure us.\n\np. 99\n\n81 Quickened is this my priestly rank, quickened is manly  \nstrength and force,  \nQuickened is his victorious power of whom I am the Household  \npriest.  \n82 The arms of these men have I raised, have raised their  \nlustre and their strength  \nWith priestly power I ruin foes and lift my friends to high  \nestate.  \n83 A share of food, O Lord of Food, vouchsafe us, invigorating  \nfood that brings no sickness.  \nOnward, still onward lead the giver. Grant us maintenance  \nboth for quadruped and biped.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XII](wyvbk12.htm)\n\n"
