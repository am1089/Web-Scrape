When the whole nature has been purified, the memory becomes firm.\nAnd when the memory (of the Highest Self) remains firm, then all the ties\n(which bind us to a belief in anything but the Self) are loosened.\n\n\'The venerable Sanatkumara showed to Narada, after his faults had been rubbed\nout, the other side of darkness. They call Sanatkumara Skanda, yea, Skanda\nthey call him.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[124:1](sbe01160.htm#fr_324) Before the acquirement of true knowledge, all\nthat has been mentioned before, spirit, hope, memory, &c., on to names, was\nsupposed to spring from the Sat, as something different from oneself. Now he\nis to know that the Sat is the Self.\n\n[124:2](sbe01160.htm#fr_325) In the preceding paragraphs appearance and\ndisappearance (birth and death) are not mentioned. This shows how easy it was\nin these treatises either to omit or to add anything that seemed important.\n\n[125:1](sbe01160.htm#fr_326) This too is meant as a verse. The commentary says\nthat the various numbers are intended to show the endless variety of form on\nthe Self after creation. Cf. Mait. Up. V, 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 1](sbe01161.htm)\n\n'
