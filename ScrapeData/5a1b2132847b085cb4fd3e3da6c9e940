XVIII.\n\nGrief of the Gopis on the departure of Krishn\xcc\x81a and Balarama with Akrura:\ntheir leaving Gokula. Akrura bathes in the Yamuna; beholds the divine forms of\nthe two youths, and praises Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nTHUS meditating, the Yadava approached Govinda, and addressed him, and said,\n"I am Akrura," and bowed his head down to the feet of Hari; but Krishn\xcc\x81a laid\nupon him his hand, which was marked with the flag, the thunderbolt, and the\nlotus, and drew him towards him, and affectionately embraced him. Then Ke\xc5\x9bava\nand Rama entered into conversation with him, and, having heard from him all\nthat had occurred, were much pleased, and led him to their habitation: there\nthey resumed their discourse, and gave him food to eat, and treated him with\nproper hospitality. Akrura told them how their father \xc3\x81nakadundubhi, the\nprincess Devaki, and even his own father, Ugrasena, had been insulted by the\niniquitous demon Kansa: he also related to them the purpose for which he had\nbeen dispatched. When he had told them all these things, the destroyer of\nKe\xc5\x9bin said to him, "I was aware of all that you have told me, lord of liberal\ngifts: Rama and I will go to-morrow to Mathura along with you. The elders of\nthe cowherds shall accompany us, bearing ample offerings. Rest here to-night,\nand dismiss all anxiety. Within three nights I will slay Kansa and his\nadherents."\n\nHaving given orders accordingly to the cowherds, Akrura, with Ke\xc5\x9bava and Rama,\nretired to rest, and slept soundly in the dwelling of Nanda. The next morning\nwas bright, and the youths prepared to depart for Mathura with Akrura. The\nGopis, seeing them about to set forth, were much afflicted; they wept\nbitterly, their bracelets were loose upon their arms, and they thus communed\ntogether: "If Govinda depart for Mathura, how will he return to Gokula? his\nears will there be regaled with the melodious and polished conversation of the\nwomen of the city. Accustomed to the language of the graceful females of\nMathura, he will never again endure the rustic expressions of the Gopis. Hari,\nthe pride of the station, is carried off, and a fatal blow is inflicted upon\nus by inexorable destiny, Expressive smiles, soft language, graceful airs,\n\np. 545\n\nelegant gait, and significant glances, belong to the women of the city. Hari\nis of rustic breeding, and, captivated by their fascinations, what likelihood\nis there of his returning to the society of any one amongst us? Ke\xc5\x9bava, who\nhas mounted the car to go to Mathura, has been deceived by the cruel, vile,\nand desperate Akrura. Does not the unfeeling traitor know the affection that\nwe all here feel for our Hari, the joy of our eyes, that he is taking him\naway? Unkind that he is, Govinda is departing from us, along with Rama: haste!\nlet us stop him! Why talk of telling our seniors that we cannot bear his loss?\nWhat can they do for us, when we are consumed by the fires of separation? The\nGopas, with Nanda at their head, are themselves preparing to depart; no one\nmakes any attempt to detain Govinda. Bright is the morning that succeeds to\nthis night for the women of Mathura, for the bees of their eyes will feed upon\nthe lotus face of Achyuta. Happy are they who may go hence without impediment,\nand behold, enraptured, Krishn\xcc\x81a on his journey. A great festival will give\npleasure to-day to the eyes of the inhabitants of Mathura, when they see the\nperson of Govinda. What a blissful vision will be seen by the happy women, of\nthe city, whose brilliant eyes shall regard, unchecked, the countenance of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a! Alas! the eyes of the Gopis have been deprived of sight by the\nrelentless Brahma, after he had shewn them this great treasure. In proportion\nas the affection of Hari for us decays, so do our limbs wither, and the\nbracelets slip from our arms: and now the cruel Akrura urges on the horses:\nall conspire to treat unhappy females with unkindness. Alas! alas! we see now\nonly the dust of his chariot wheels! and now he is far away, for even that\ndust is no longer to be seen!" Thus lamented by the women, Ke\xc5\x9bava and Rama\nquitted the district of Vraja 1. Travelling in a car drawn by fleet horses,\nthey arrived at noon at the banks of the Yamuna, when Akrura requested them to\nhalt a little, whilst he performed the\n\np. 546\n\nusual daily ceremonial in the river 2. Accordingly the intelligent Akrura\nbathed, and rinsed his mouth, and then entering the stream, he stood\nmeditating upon the supreme being; but he beheld mentally 3 Balabhadra, having\na thousand hooded beads, a garland of Jasmine flowers, and large red eyes,\nattended by Vasuki, Rambha, and other mighty serpents, praised by the\nGandharbas, decorated with wild flowers, wearing dark coloured garments,\ncrowned with a chaplet of lotuses, ornamented with brilliant earrings,\ninebriate, and standing at the bottom of the river in the water 4. On his lap\nhe also beheld, at his ease, Krishn\xcc\x81a, of the complexion of a cloud 5, with\nfull and coppery eyes, having an elegant form, and four hands, armed with the\ndiscus and other weapons, wearing yellow clothes, decorated with many coloured\nflowers, and appearing like a cloud embellished with streams of lightning and\nthe bow of Indra; his breast was marked with the celestial sign, his arms were\nradiant with bracelets, a diadem shone on his brow, and he wore a white lotus\nfor his crest: he was attended by Sanandana and other holy sages, who, fixing\ntheir eyes upon the tips of their noses, were absorbed in profound meditation.\n\nWhen Akrura beheld Balarama and Krishn\xcc\x81a in this situation, he was much\namazed, and wondered how they could so quickly have got there from the\nchariot. He wished to ask them this, but Janarddana deprived him of the\nfaculty of speech at the moment. Ascending then from the water, he repaired to\nthe car, and there he found them both quietly seated in the same human persons\nas before. Plunging again into the water, there he again beheld them, hymned\nas before by the Gandharbas, saints, sages, and serpents. Apprehending,\ntherefore, their real character, he thus eulogized the eternal deity, who\nconsists of true knowledge:--\n\np. 547\n\n"Salutation to thee, who art uniform and manifold, all-pervading, supreme\nspirit, of inconceivable glory, and who art simple existence. Salutation to\nthee, O inscrutable, who art truth, and the essence of oblations. Salutation\nto thee, O lord, whose nature is unknown, who art beyond primeval matter, who\nexistest in five forms, as one with the elements, with the faculties, with\nmatter, with the living soul, with supreme spirit. Shew favour to me, O soul\nof the universe, essence of all things, perishable or eternal, whether\naddressed by the designation of Brahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u, \xc5\x9aiva, or the like. I adore\nthee, O god, whose nature is indescribable, whose purposes are inscrutable,\nwhose name even is unknown; for the attributes of kind or appellation are not\napplicable to thee, who art THAT 6, the supreme Brahma, eternal, unchangeable,\nuntreated. But as the accomplishment of our objects cannot be attained except\nthrough some specific form, thou art termed by us Krishn\xcc\x81a, Achyuta, Ananta,\nor Vishn\xcc\x81u. Thou, unborn divinity, art all the objects of these\nimpersonations; thou art the gods, and all other beings; thou art the whole\nworld; thou art all. Soul of the universe, thou art exempt from change, and\nthere is nothing except thee in all this existence. Thou art Brahma, Pa\xc5\x9bupati,\n\xc3\x81ryaman, Dhatri, and Vidhatri; thou art Indra, air, fire, the regent of the\nwaters, the god of wealth, and judge of the dead; and thou, although but one,\npresidest over the world with various energies, addressed to various purposes.\nThou, identical with the solar ray, createst the universe; all elementary\nsubstance is composed of thy qualities; and thy supreme form is denoted by the\nimperishable term SAT (existence). To him who is one with true knowledge, who\nis and is not perceptible, I bow. Glory be to him, the lord Vasudeva, to\nSankarshan\xcc\x81a, to Pradyumna, and to Aniruddha 7."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[545:1](vp135.htm#fr_1503) In the Bhagavata, Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, &c. several\nadventures of Krishn\xcc\x81a, during his residence at Vraja, are recorded, of which\nour text makes no mention. Of these, the two most popular are Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s\ntaking away the clothes of the Gopis whilst bathing, and his liberating the\nGopas from the mouth of Aghasura, disguised as a vast serpent, into which they\nhad entered, thinking it a cavern in a mountain. The omission of these two\nlegends, or of any of the rest, is not much to be regretted.\n\n[546:2](vp135.htm#fr_1504) The noonday prayer, or Sandhya.\n\n[546:3](vp135.htm#fr_1505) By his Dhyana, or force of meditation, in which it\nis attempted to bring before the mind\'s eye some definite form of the object\nof adoration. In this case Akrura is compelled to see a form he did not\nanticipate. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba very clumsily sets him to meditate upon the serpent\n\xc5\x9aesha, which spoils the story, intended as that is to exhibit the identity of\nBalarama and Krishn\xcc\x81a with the supreme.\n\n[546:4](vp135.htm#fr_1506) Balarama was thus visible in his real character of\n\xc5\x9aesha, the chief of serpents, the couch of Vishn\xcc\x81u, and supporter of the\nworld.\n\n[546:5](vp135.htm#fr_1507) Or rather, he beheld Ghana\xc5\x9byama, an appellation of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, who is so called from being as black (\xc5\x9byama) as a cloud (ghana).\n\n[547:6](vp135.htm#fr_1508) Tad, \'that;\' all that is, or that can be conceived.\n\n[547:7](vp135.htm#fr_1509) Akrura\'s piety is here prophetic; the son and\ngrandson of Krishn\xcc\x81a (see [p. 440](vp108.htm#page_440)) are not yet born: but\nthis is the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava style of addressing Krishn\xcc\x81a or Vishn\xcc\x81u, as identical\nwith four Vyuhas, \'arrangements\' or \'dispositions,\' Krishn\xcc\x81a, Balarama,\nPradyumna, and Aniruddha. See As. Res. XVI. 35. In this, as in several other\nplaces, the Vishn\xcc\x81u P. differs from some of the other narratives of Krishn\xcc\x81a,\nby the length and character of the prayers addressed to Vishn\xcc\x81u. The Hari\nVan\xc5\x9ba, for instance, here has no prayer or panegyric at all: the Bhagavata\ninserts one.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIX](vp136.htm)\n\n'
