Pra _g_ apati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is here performed,\nand whence these creatures have been produced, and in like manner are they\nproduced therefrom even to this day. Having drawn the A _s_ vina graha, he\nmakes (the sacrificer) eye (the several cups, while muttering) the Avaka _s_ a\nformulas 1.\n\n4:5:6:22\\. The Upa _m_ _s_ u cup he eyes first with (Va _g_. S. VII, 27), 'For\nmine out-breathing, (a) giver of lustre 2, become thou pure for lustre!' Then\nthe Upa _m_ _s_ usavana stone with, 'For my through-breathing, giver of\nlustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Antaryama cup with, 'For mine\nup-breathing, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the\nAindravayava with, 'For my voice, giver of lustre, become thou pure for\nlustre!' Then the Maitravaru _n_ a with, 'For mine intelligence and will,\ngiver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the A _s_ vina with, 'For\nmine ear, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the _S_ u _k_ ra\nand Manthin with, 'For mine eyes, givers of lustre, become ye pure for\nlustre!'\n\n4:5:6:33\\. Then the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a with (Va _g_. S. VII, 28), 'For my mind,\ngiver of lustre, become thou -pure for lustre!' Then the Ukthya with, 'For\n\np. 410\n\nmy vigour, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Dhruva\nwith, 'For my life, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the\ntwo Soma-troughs (Putabh _ri_ t and \xc3\x82dhavaniya) with, 'For all mine offspring,\ngivers of lustre, become ye pure for lustre!' Now the two troughs belong to\nthe All-gods, for therefrom they draw (Soma) for the gods, therefrom for men,\ntherefrom for the Fathers: therefore the two Soma-troughs belong to the All-\ngods.\n\n4:5:6:44\\. Then the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a with (Va _g_. S. VII, 29), 'Who (ka)\nart thou? Which one art thou?'--Ka is Pra _g_ apati;--'Whose (kasya, or Ka's)\nart thou? who (ka) art thou by name?'--Ka ('who') by name is Pra _g_\napati;--'Thou upon whose name we have thought,' for he indeed thinks upon his\nname;--'Thou whom we have gladdened with Soma;'--for he indeed gladdens him\nwith Soma. Having drawn the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina cup, he prays for blessing part after\npart (of the sacrifice) with, 'May I be abundantly supplied with offspring,'\nthereby he prays for offspring;--'abundantly supplied with men,' thereby he\nprays for men (heroes);--'abundantly supplied with food!' thereby he prays for\nprosperity.\n\n4:5:6:55\\. He must not let every one eye them, but only him who is well known,\nor one who is his friend, or one who, being learned in sacred lore, may\nacquire these (texts) through study. Having drawn the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina cup, he\n(thus) produces the whole sacrifice; and having produced the whole sacrifice,\nhe deposits it in his own self, and makes it his own.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[409:1](sbe2665.htm#fr_957) For the proper place of this ceremony in the\nactual performance of the Agnish _t_ oma, see [p. 312](sbe2649.htm#page_312),\nnote [4](sbe2649.htm#fn_752).\n\n[409:2](sbe2665.htm#fr_958) Either, thou who bestowest lustre on my out-\nbreathing . . ., or, Thou who art a bestower of lustre, become thou pure for\nlustre to my out-breathing.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 5, 7.
