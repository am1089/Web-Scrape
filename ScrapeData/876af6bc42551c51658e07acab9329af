In any case the same (duties have to be performed) on account of the\ntwofold indicatory marks.\n\nIn any case, i.e. whether viewed as duties incumbent on the a _s_ ramas or as\nco-operating with knowledge, the very same agnihotra and other duties have to\nbe performed.--What, it may be asked, does the teacher wish to preclude by the\nemphatic expression 'the very same?'--The suspicion, we reply, that those\nworks might be separate works 1. In the ayana of the Ku _n_ _d_ apayins indeed\nthe injunctive statement,' They offer the agnihotra for a month 2,' enjoins a\nsacrifice different from the permanent (ordinary) agnihotra; but in our\npresent case there is no analogous separation of works.--Why?--On account of\nthe twofold indicatory mark; i.e. on account of both scripture and Sm _ri_ ti\nsupplying indicatory marks. In the first place, the scriptural passage, 'Him\nthe Brahma _n_ as seek to know through the study of the Veda,' &c., directs\nthat sacrifices and the like--as things already established and the form of\nwhich is already in existence (viz. through previous injunctions)--are to be\nemployed as means in the search for knowledge; and does not originate a new\nform of those works, while the passage quoted above, 'They offer the agnihotra\nfor a month,' does originate a new separate sacrifice.--In the second place\nthe Sm _ri_ ti-passage, 'He who performs the work to be done without aiming at\nthe fruit of the work,' shows that the very same work which is already known\nas something to be performed subserves the origination of knowledge. Moreover\nthe Sm _ri_ ti-passage, 'He who is qualified by those forty-eight\npurifications,' &c., refers to the purifications required for Vedic works,\nwith a view to the origination of knowledge in him who has undergone those\npurifications.--The Sutrakara therefore rightly emphasizes the non-difference\nof the works.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[314:1](sbe38243.htm#fr_199) That the works referred to in the Upanishads as\nmeans of knowledge, might be works altogether different from those enjoined in\nthe karmaka _n_ _d_ a as means of bringing about certain special results such\nas the heavenly world.\n\n[314:2](sbe38243.htm#fr_200) See above, [p. 250](sbe38183.htm#page_250).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 35](sbe38244.htm)\n\n"
