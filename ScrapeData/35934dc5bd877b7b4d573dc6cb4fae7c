Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# MAHABHARATA BOOK IV\n\n# DYUTA\n\n_\n\n(The Fatal Dice)\n\n_\n\nDURYODHAN came back from the Imperial Sacrifice filled with jealousy against\nYudhishthir, and devised plans to effect his fall. Sakuni, prince of Gandhara,\nshared Duryodhan\'s hatred towards the sons of Pandu, and helped him in his\ndark scheme. Yudhishthir with all his piety and righteousness had one\nweakness, the love of gambling, which was one of the besetting sins of the\nmonarchs of the day. Sakuni was an expert at false dice, and challenged\nYudhishthir, and Yudhishthir held it a point of honour not to decline such a\nchallenge.\n\nHe came from his new capital, Indra-prastha, to Hastina-pura the capital of\nDuryodhan, with his mother and brothers and Draupadi. And as Yudhishthir lost\ngame after game, he was stung with his losses, and with the recklessness of a\ngambler still went on with the fatal game. His wealth and hoarded gold and\njewels, his steeds, elephants and cars, his slaves male and female, his empire\nand possessions, were all staked and lost!\n\nThe madness increased, and Yudhishthir staked his brothers, and then himself,\nand then the fair Draupadi, and lost! And thus the Emperor of Indra-prastha\nand his family were deprived of every possession on earth, and became the\nbond-slaves of Duryodhan. The old king Dhrita-rashtra released them from\nactual slavery, but the five brothers retired to forests as homeless exiles.\n\nPortions of Section lxv. and the whole of Sections lxix., lxxvi., and lxxvii.\nof Book ii. of the original text have been translated in this Book.\n\n## I\n\n## DRAUPADI IN THE COUNCIL HALL\n\nGlassed on Ganga\'s limpid waters brightly shine Hastina\'s walls  \nQueen Draupadi duly honoured lives within the palace halls,\n\nBut as steals a lowly jackal in a lordly lion\'s den,  \nBase Duryodhan\'s humble menial came to proud Draupadi\'s ken.\n\nPardon, Empress," quoth the menial, "royal Pandu\'s righteous son,  \nLost his game and lost his reason, Empress, thou art staked and won,\n\nPrince Duryodhan claims thee, lady, and the victor bids me say,  \nThou shalt serve him as his vassal, as his slave in palace stay!"\n\n"Have I heard thee, menial, rightly?" questioned she in anguish keen,  \n"Doth a crowned king and husband stake his wife and lose his queen,\n\nDid my noble lord and monarch sense and reason lose at dice,  \nOther stake he did not wager, wedded wife to sacrifice!"\n\n"Other stakes were duly wagered," so he spake with bitter groan,  \n"Wealth and empire, every object which Yudhishthir called his own,\n\nLost himself and all his brothers, bondsmen are those princes brave,  \nThen he staked his wife and empress, thou art prince Duryodhan\'s slave!"\n\nRose the queen in queenly anger, and with woman\'s pride she spake  \n"Hie thee, menial, to thy master, Queen Draupadi\'s answer take,\n\nIf my lord, himself a bondsman, then hath staked his queen and wife,  \nFalse the stake, for owns a bondsman neither wealth nor other\'s life,\n\nSlave can wager wife nor children, and such action is undone,  \nTake my word to prince Duryodhan, Queen Draupadi is unwon!"\n\nWrathful was the proud Duryodhan when he heard the answer bold,  \nTo his younger, wild Duhsasan, this his angry mandate told:\n\n"Little-minded is the menial, and his heart in terror fails,  \nFor the fear of wrathful Bhima, lo! his coward-bosom quails,\n\nThou Duhsasan, bid the princess as our humble slave appear,  \nPandu\'s sons are humble bondsmen, and thy heart it owns no fear!"\n\nFierce Duhsasan heard the mandate, blood-shot was his flaming eye,  \nForthwith to the inner chambers did with eager footsteps hie,\n\nProudly sat the fair Draupadi, monarch\'s daughter, monarch\'s wife,  \nUnto her the base Duhsasan spake the message, insult-rife:\n\nLotus-eyed Panchala-princess! fairly staked and won at game.  \nCome and meet thy lord Duryodhan, chase that mantling blush of shame,\n\nServe us as thy lords and masters, be our beauteous bright-eyed slave,  \nCome unto the Council Chamber, wait upon the young and brave!"\n\nProud Draupadi shakes with tremor at Duhsasan\'s hateful sight,  \nAnd she shades her eye and forehead, and her bloodless cheeks are white,\n\nAt his words her chaste heart sickens, and with wild averted eye.  \nUnto rooms where dwelt the women, Queen Draupadi seeks to fly.\n\nVainly sped the trembling princess in her fear and in her shame,  \nBy her streaming wavy tresses fierce Duhsasan held the dame!\n\nSacred looks! with holy water dewed at _rajasuya_ rite,  \nAnd by _mantra_ consecrated, fragrant, flowing, raven-bright,\n\nBase Duhsasan by those tresses held the faint and flying queen,  \nFeared no more the sons of Pandu, nor their vengeance fierce and keen,\n\nDragged her in her slipping garments by her long and trailing hair,  \nAnd like sapling tempest-shaken, wept and shook the trembling fair!\n\nStooping in her shame and anguish, pale with wrath and woman\'s fear,  \nTrembling and in stifled accents, thus she spake with streaming tear:\n\nLeave me, shameless prince Duhsasan! elders, noble lords are here,  \nCan a modest wedded woman thus in loose attire appear?"\n\nVain the words and soft entreaty which the weeping princess made,  \nVainly to the gods and mortals she in bitter anguish prayed,\n\nFor with cruel words of insult still Duhsasan mocked her woo:  \n"Loosely clad or void of clothing,--to the council hall you go,\n\nSlave-wench fairly staked and conquered, wait upon thy masters brave,  \nLive among our household menials, serve us as our willing slave!\n\n## II\n\n## DRAUPADI\'S PLAINT\n\nLoose-attired, with trailing tresses, came Draupadi weak and faint,  \nStood within the Council Chamber, tearful made her piteous plaint:\n\n"Elders! versed in holy _sastra_ , and in every holy rite,  \nPardon if Draupadi cometh in this sad unseemly plight,\n\nStay thy sinful deed, Duhsasan, nameless wrongs and insults spare,  \nTouch me not with hands uncleanly, sacred is a woman\'s hair,\n\nHonoured elders, righteous nobles, have on me protection given,  \nTremble sinner, seek no mercy from the wrathful gods in heaven!\n\nHere in glory, son of DHARMA, sits my noble righteous lord,  \nSin nor shame nor human frailty stains Yudhishthir\'s deed or word,\n\nSilent all? and will no chieftain rise to save a woman\'s life,  \nNot a hand or voice is lifted to defend a virtuous wife?\n\nLost is Kuru\'s righteous glory, lost is Bharat\'s ancient name,  \nLost is Kshatra\'s kingly prowess, warlike worth and knightly fame,\n\nWherefore else do Kuru warriors tamely view this impious scene,  \nWherefore gleam not righteous weapons to protect an outraged queen?\n\nBhishma, hath he lost his virtue, Drona, hath he lost his might,  \nHath the monarch of the Kurus ceased to battle for the right,\n\nWherefore are ye mute and voiceless, councillors of mighty fame,  \nVacant eye and palsied right arm watch this deed of Kuru\'s shame?\n\n## III\n\n## INSULT AND VOW OF REVENGE\n\nSpake Draupadi slender-waisted, and her words were stern and high,  \nAnger flamed within her bosom and the tear was in her eye,\n\nAnd her sparkling speaking glances fell on Pandu\'s sons like fire,  \nStirred in them a mighty passion and a thirst for vengeance dire,\n\nLost their empire wealth and fortune, little recked they for the fall,  \nBut Draupadi\'s pleading glances like a poniard smote them all!\n\nDarkly frowned the ancient Bhishma, wrathful Drona bit his tongue,  \nPale Vidura marked with anger insults on Draupadi flung,\n\nFulsome word nor foul dishonour could their truthful utterance taint,  \nAnd they cursed Duhsasan\'s action, when they heard Draupadi\'s plaint.\n\nBut brave Karna, though a warrior,--Arjun\'s deadly foe was he,  \n\'Gainst the humbled sons of Pandu spake his scorn in scornful glee:\n\n"\'Tis no fault of thine, fair princess, fallen to this servile state,  \nWife and son rule not their actions, others rule their hapless fate,\n\nThy Yudhishthir sold his birthright, sold thee at the impious play,  \nAnd the wife falls with the husband, and her duty-to obey\n\nLive thou in this Kuru household, do the Kuru princes\' will,  \nServe them as thy lords and masters, with thy beauty please them still,\n\nFair One! seek another husband who in foolish reckless game  \nWill not stake a loving woman, will not cast her forth in shame!\n\nFor they censure not a woman, when she is a menial slave,  \nIf her woman\'s fancy wanders to the young and to the brave,\n\nFor thy lord is not thy husband, as a slave he hath no wife,  \nThou art free with truer lover to enjoy a wedded life,\n\nThey whom at the _swayamvara_ , thou had\'st chose, Panchala\'s bride,  \nThey have lost thee, sweet Draupadi, lost their empire and their pride!"\n\nBhima heard, and quick and fiercely heaved his bosom in his shame,  \nAnd his red glance fell on Karna like a tongue of withering flame,\n\nBound by elder\'s plighted promise Bhima could not smite in ire,  \nLooked the painted form of Anger flaming with an anguish dire!\n\n"King and elder! " uttered Bhima, and his words were few and brave,\n\n"Vain were wrath and righteous passion in the sold and bounden slave,\n\nWould that son of chariot-driver fling on us this insult keen,  \nHadst thou, noble king and elder, staked nor freedom nor our queen?"\n\nSad Yudhishthir heard in anguish, bent in shame his lowly head,  \nProud Duryodhan laughed in triumph, and in scornful accents said:\n\nSpeak, Yudhishthir, for thy brothers own their elder\'s righteous sway,  \nSpeak, for truth in thee abideth, virtue ever marks thy way,\n\nHast thou lost thy new-built empire, and thy brothers proud and brave,  \nHast thou lost thy fair Draupadi, is thy wedded wife our slave?\n\nLip nor eye did move Yudhishthir, hateful truth might not deny,  \nKarna laughed, but saintly Bhishma wiped his old and manly eye.\n\nMadness seized the proud Duryodhan, and inflamed by passion base,  \nSought the prince to stain Draupadi with a deep and dire disgrace,\n\nOn the proud and peerless woman cast his wicked lustful eye,  \nSought to hold the high-born princess as his slave upon his knee!\n\nBhima penned his wrath no longer, lightning-like his glance he flung  \nAnd the ancient hall of Kurus with his thunder accents rung:\n\nMay I never reach those mansions where my fathers live on high,  \nMay I never meet ancestors in the bright and happy sky,\n\n\'If that knee, by which thou sinnest, Bhima breaks not in his ire,  \nIn the battle\'s red arena with his weapon, deathful, dire!"\n\nRed fire flamed on Bhima\'s forehead, sparkled from his angry eye,  \nAs from tough and gnarled branches fast the crackling red sparks fly!\n\n## IV\n\n## DHRITA-RASTRA\'S KINDNESS\n\nHark! within the sacred chamber, where the priests in white attire  \nWith libations morn and evening feed the sacrificial fire,\n\nAnd o\'er sacred rights of _homa_ Brahmans chant their _mantra_ high,  \nThere is heard the jackal\'s wailing and the raven\'s ominous cry!\n\nWise Vidura knew that omen, and the Queen Gandhari knew,  \nBhishma muttered _"svasti! svasti!"_ at this portent strange and new,\n\nDrona and preceptor Kripa uttered too that holy word,  \nSpake her fears the Queen Gandhari to her spouse and royal lord.\n\nDhrita-rashtra heard and trembled with a sudden holy fear,  \nAnd his feeble accents quavered, and his eyes were dimmed by tear:\n\n"Son Duryodhan, ever luckless, godless, graceless, witless child,  \nHast thou Drupad\'s virtuous daughter thus insulted and reviled,\n\nHast thou courted death and danger, for destruction clouds our path,  \nCan an old man\'s soft entreaties still avert this sign of wrath?\n\nSlow and gently to Draupadi was the sightless monarch led,  \nAnd in kind and gentle accents unto her the old man said:\n\nNoblest empress, dearest daughter, good Yudhishthir\'s stainless wife,  \nPurest of the Kuru ladies, nearest to my heart and life,\n\nPardon wrong and cruel insult and avert the wrath of Heaven,  \nVoice thy wish and ask for blessing, be my son\'s misdeed forgiven!"\n\nAnswered him the fair Draupadi: "Monarch of the Kuru\'s line,  \nFor thy grace and for thy mercy every joy on earth be thine,\n\nSince thou bid\'st me name my wishes, this the boon I ask of thee,  \nThat my gracious lord Yudhishthir once again be bondage-free!\n\nI have borne a child unto him, noble boy and fair and brave,  \nBe he prince of royal station, not the son of bounden slave,\n\nLet not light unthinking children point to him in utter scorn,  \nCall him slave and _dasaputra_ , of a slave and bondsman born!\n\n"Virtuous daughter, have thy wishes," thus the ancient monarch cried,  \n"Name a second boon and blessing, and it shall be gratified."\n\n"Grant me then, O gracious father! mighty Bhima, Arjun brave,  \nAnd the youngest twin-born brothers,--none of them may be a slave\n\nWith their arms and with their chariots let the noble princes part,  \nFreemen let them range the country, strong of hand and stout of heart!"\n\n"Be it so, high-destined princess ancient Dhrita-rashtra cried,  \n"Name another boon and blessing, and it shall be gratified,\n\nForemost of my queenly daughters, dearest-cherished and the best,  \nMeeting thus thy gentle wishes now I feel my house is blest!"\n\n"Not so," answered him the princess, "other boon I may not seek,  \nThou art bounteous, and a woman should be modest, wise and meek,\n\nTwice I asked, and twice you granted, and a Kshatra asks no more,  \nUnto Brahmans it is given, asking favours evermore,\n\nNow my lord and warlike brothers, from their hateful bondage freed,  \nSeek their fortune by their prowess and by brave and virtuous deed!"\n\n## V\n\n## THE BANISHMENT\n\nNow Yudhishthir \'reft of empire, far from kinsmen, hearth and home,  \nWith his wife and faithful brothers must as houseless exiles roam,\n\nParting blessings spake Yudhishthir, "Elder of the Kuru line,  \nNoble grandsire stainless Bhishma, may thy glories ever shine,\n\nDrona priest and great preceptor, saintly Kripa true and brave,  \nKuru\'s monarch Dhrita-rashtra, may the gods thy empire save,\n\nGood Vidura true and faithful, may thy virtue serve thee well.  \nWarlike sons of Dhrita-rashtra, let me bid you all farewell!\n\nSo he spake unto his kinsmen, wishing good for evil done,  \nAnd in silent shame they listened, parting words they uttered none,\n\nPained at heart was good Vidura, and he asked in sore distress:  \n"Noble Pritha, will she wander in the pathless wilderness?\n\nRoyal-born, unused to hardship, weak and long unused to roam,  \nAged is thy saintly mother, let fair Pritha stay at home,\n\nAnd by all beloved, respected, in my house shall Pritha dwell,  \nTill your years of exile over, ye shall greet her safe and well."\n\nAnswered him the sons of Pandu: " Be it even as you say,  \nUnto us thou art a father, we thy sacred will obey,\n\nGive us then thy holy blessings, friend and father, ere we part,  \nBlessings from the true and righteous brace the feeble, fainting heart."\n\nSpake Vidura, pious-hearted: "Best of Bharat\'s ancient race,  \nLet me bless thee and thy brothers, souls of truth and righteous grace,\n\nFortune brings no weal to mortals who may win by wicked wile,  \nSorrow brings no shame to mortals who are free from sin and guile!\n\nThou art trained in laws of duty, Arjun is unmatched in war,  \nAnd on Bhima in the battle kindly shines his faithful star,\n\nAnd the Twins excel in wisdom, born to rule a mighty State,  \nFair Draupadi, ever faithful. wins the smiles of fickle Fate!\n\nEach with varied gifts encircled, each beloved of one and all,  \nYe shall win a spacious empire. greater, mightier, after fall.\n\nAnd your exile, good Yudhishthir, is ordained to serve your kveal,  \nIs a trial and _samadhi_ , for it chastens but to heal!\n\nMeru taught thee righteous maxims where Himalay soars above,  \nAnd in Varnavata\'s forest Vyasa taught thee holy love,\n\nRama preached the laws of duty far on Bhrigu\'s lofty hill,  \nSambhu showed the path of virtue by fair Drisad-vati\'s rill,\n\nFell from lips of saint Asita, words of wisdom deep and grave,  \nBhrigu touched with fire thy bosom by the dark Kalmashi\'s wave!\n\nNow once more the teaching cometh, purer, brighter, oftener taught,  \nLearn the truth from heavenly Narad, happy is thy mortal lot,\n\nGreater than the son of Ila, than the kings of earth in might,  \nHolier than the holy _rishis_ , be thou in thy virtue bright!\n\nINDRA help thee in thy battles, proud subduer of mankind,  \nYAMA in the mightier duty, in the conquest of thy mind,\n\nGood KUVERA teach thee kindness, hungry and the poor to feed,  \nKing VARNUA quell thy passions, free thy heart from sin and greed,\n\nLike the Moon in holy lustre, like the Earth in patience deep,  \nLike the Sun be full of radiance, strong like Wind\'s resistless sweep!\n\nIn thy sorrow, in affliction, ever deeper lessons learn,  \nRighteous be your life in exile, happy be your safe return,\n\nMay these eyes again behold thee in Hastina\'s ancient town,  \nConqueror of earthly trials, crowned with virtue\'s heavenly crown!"\n\nSpake Vidura to the brothers, and they felt their might increase,  \nBowed to him in salutation, filled with deeper, holier peace,\n\nBowed to Bhishma and to Drona, and to chiefs and elders all,  \nExiles to the pathless jungle, left their father\'s ancient hall!\n\n## VI\n\n## PRITHA\'S LAMENT\n\nIn the inner palace chambers where the royal ladies dwell,  \nUnto Pritha, came Draupadi, came to speak her sad farewell,\n\nMonarch\'s daughter, monarch\'s consort, as an exile she must go,  \nPritha wept and in the chambers rose the wailing voice of woe!\n\nHeaving sobs convulsed her bosom as a silent prayer she prayed,  \nAnd in accents choked by anguish thus her parting words she said:\n\n"Grieve not, child, if bitter fortune so ordains that we must part,  \nVirtue hath her consolations for the true and loving heart,\n\nAnd I need not tell thee, daughter, duties of a faithful wife,  \nDrupad\'s and thy husband\'s mansions thou hast brightened by thy life!\n\nNobly from the sinning Kurus thou hast turned thy righteous wrath,  \nSafely, with a mother\'s blessing, tread the trackless jungle path,\n\nDangers bring no woe or sorrow to the true and faithful wife,  \nSinless deed and holy conduct ever guard her charmed life,\n\nNurse thy lord with woman\'s kindness, and his brothers, where ye go,  \nYoung in years in Sahadeva, gentle and unused to woe!"\n\n"May thy blessings help me, mother," so the fair Draupadi said,  \n"Safe in righteous truth and virtue, forest paths we fearless tread!"\n\nWet her eyes and loose her tresses, fair Draupadi bowed and left,  \nAncient Pritha weeping followed of all earthly joy bereft,\n\nAs she went, her duteous children now before their mother came,  \nClad in garments of the deer-skin, and their heads were bent in shame!\n\nSorrow welling in her bosom choked her voice and filled her eye,  \nTill in broken stifled accents faintly thus did Pritha cry:\n\n"Ever true to path of duty, noble children void of stain,  \nTrue to gods, to mortals faithful, why this undeserved pain,\n\nWherefore hath untimely sorrow like a darksome cloud above,  \nCast its pale and deathful shadow on the children of my love?\n\nWoe to me, your wretched mother, woe to her who gave you birth,  \nStainless sons, for sins of Pritha have ye suffered on this earth,\n\nShall ye range the pathless forest dreary day and darksome night,  \n\'Reft of all save native virtue, clad in native, inborn might?\n\nWoe to me, from rocky mountains where I dwelt by Pandu\'s side,  \nWhen I lost him, to Hastina wherefore came I in my pride,\n\nHappy is your sainted father, dwells in regions of the sky,  \nSees nor feels these earthly sorrows gathering on us thick and high,\n\nHappy too is faithful Madri, for she trod the virtuous way,  \nFollowed Pandu to the bright sky, and is now his joy and stay!\n\nYe alone are left to Pritha, dear unto her joyless heart,  \nMother\'s hope and widow\'s treasure, and ye may not, shall not part,\n\nLeave me not alone on wide earth, loving sons, your virtues prove,  \nDear Draupadi, loving daughter, lot a mother\'s tear-drops move,\n\nGrant me mercy, kind Creator, and my days in mercy close,  \nEnd my sorrows, kind VIDHATA, end my life with all my woes!\n\nHelp me, pious-hearted Krishna, friend of friendless, wipe my pain,  \nAll who suffer pray unto thee and they never pray in vain,\n\nHelp me, Bhishma, warlike Drona, Kripa ever good and wise,  \nYe are friends of truth and virtue, righteous truth ye ever prize,\n\nHelp me from thy starry mansions, husband, wherefore dost thou wait,  \nSeest thou not thy godlike children exiled by a bitter fate!\n\nPart not, leave me not, my children, seek ye not the trackless way,  \nStay but one, if one child only, as your mother\'s hope and stay,\n\nYoungest, gentlest Sahadeva, dearest to this widowed heart,  \nWilt thou watch beside thy mother, while thy cruel brothers part?"\n\nWhispering words of consolation, Pritha\'s children wiped her tear,  \nThen unto the pathless jungle turned their footsteps lone and drear!\n\nKuru dames with fainting Pritha to Vidura\'s palace hie,  \nKuru queens for weeping Pritha raise their voice in answering cry,\n\nKuru maids for fair Draupadi fortune\'s fitful will upbraid,  \nAnd their tear-dewed lotus-faces with their streaming fingers shade,\n\nDhrita-rashtra, ancient monarch, is by sad misgivings pained,  \nQuestions oft with anxious bosom what the cruel fates ordained,\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book V: Woman\'s Love](maha05.htm)\n\n'
