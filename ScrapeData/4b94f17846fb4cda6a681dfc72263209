(When\n\np. 109\n\nhe denies, they say), "Heat the hatchet for him." If he committed the theft,\nthen he makes himself to be what he is not. Then the false-minded, having\ncovered his true Self by a falsehood, grasps the heated hatchet--he is burnt,\nand he is killed.\n\n2\\. \'But if he did not commit the theft, then he makes himself to be what he\nis. Then the true-minded, having covered his true Self by truth, grasps the\nheated hatchet--he is not burnt, and he is delivered.\n\n\'As that (truthful) man is not burnt, thus has all that exists its self in\nThat. It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O _S_ vetaketu, art it.\' He\nunderstood what he said, yea, he understood it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[108:1](sbe01134.htm#fr_301) The next question is: Why does he who knows, on\nobtaining the Sat, not return, while he who does not know, though obtaining\nthe Sat in death, returns? An illustration is chosen which is intended to show\nhow knowledge produces a material effect. The belief in the efficacy of\nordeals must have existed at the time, and appealing to that belief, the\nteacher says that the man who knows himself guilty, is really burnt by the\nheated iron, while the man who knows himself innocent, is not. In the same\nmanner the man who knows his Self to be the true Self, on approaching after\ndeath the true Self, is not repelled and sent back into a new existence, while\nhe who does not know, is sent back into a new round of births and deaths. The\nman who tells a falsehood about himself, loses his true Self and is burnt; the\nman who has a false conception about his Self, loses likewise his true Self,\nand not knowing the true Self, even though approaching it in death, he has to\nsuffer till he acquires some day the true knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 1](sbe01135.htm)\n\n'
