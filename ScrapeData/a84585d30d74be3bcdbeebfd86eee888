And Parikshit on a certain day, being out hunting and\npursuing a deer, outstripped all his companions and wandered alone in a dense\ndark forest, far away from human habitations. Now the king was both weary and\na-hungered, and seeing the cool shadows, and catching sight of a beautiful\npool, he pushed forward and plunged in, with the idea of bathing and resting.\nAnd when both he and his horse were cool and refreshed, he gathered lotus\nleaves and sterns and placed them before the animal, and he himself lay down\non the short grass beneath the trees.\n\nAs he lay there, between sleeping and waking, he heard the sound of a sweet\nvoice singing. In his astonishment he sat up, to see who could be in his\nneighbourhood, for nowhere had he seen the footprints of men, nor had he\nsupposed that he was near human dwellings. As he watched he saw, through the\nbushes, a maiden gathering\n\np. 114\n\nflowers, and she was of a surpassing loveliness and sang as she plucked.\nPresently, in her quest of flowers, she drew unwittingly near the king, and he\nheld his breath with sheer delight at the beauty of her voice and features.\n\nAt last he resolved to speak. "Blessed one," he said gently, "who art thou?\nand whose?"\n\n"Whose?" said the girl, with a start, "I? I belong to none. I am unwed."\n\n"Unwed?" said the king, "oh do then, I pray thee, grant thyself to me!"\n\n"If I did," said the maiden slowly and pensively, "If I did, I should require\na promise--!"\n\n"What promise couldst thou ask," cried the enamoured king, "that I could not\ngrant? Speak! What is it?"\n\n"If I am to marry thee," said the damsel mysteriously, "thou must give me a\npledge that never wouldst thou ask me to look upon water. Unless I had this\npromise, I could not wed." And as she spoke she cast upon the king a look of\nsuch more than mortal sweetness that he felt as if he would swoon away.\n\n"Dear heart," cried Parikshit, "what a little thing were this to stand between\nus! From the moment that thou art mine, I promise thee never to ask thee to\ncast thine eyes on water."\n\nAnd the maiden, hearing this, bowed her head, and they exchanged tokens of\nmarriage, and hand\n\np. 115\n\nin hand sat down on the grass together in silence. And as they remained thus,\nthe king\'s friends and escort came up, having searched for and followed him.\nAnd finding him thus in the company of a newly-affianced bride, a state\ncarriage was brought, and the two entered it, and were driven back to the\ncapital together.\n\nNow from this time forward, it was as if some strange enchantment had been\nwoven about the king. He was always in the private apartments with his newly-\nwedded queen. And instead of his absorption in her growing less, it seemed to\nbecome stronger and stronger, till none could obtain access to him, and the\nroyal ministers were refused audience.\n\nWhen this was on the verge of becoming a public scandal, the chief minister\nsent for one of the waiting-women about the palace, and questioned her closely\nconcerning the nature of her who had so infatuated their sovereign. And the\nmaid said: "Her beauty is undeniable and unsurpassed. In charm and loveliness\nshe is without a peer. But one thing about her is very strange. The king was\nable to marry her only after promising that he would never show her water."\n\nNow when the prime minister heard this he went away and caused a royal park to\nbe laid out, well-planted with trees that were laden with\n\np. 116\n\nflowers and fruit. And in a hidden place within the park he dug a beautiful\nbathing-pool, filled with water that was sweet as nectar, and well covered\nwith a net of pearls. And when it was finished he came privately one day to\nthe monarch and said, "Here is a delightful forest without water. Let it be\nused for the royal pleasure." And, hearing this, the king and his adored queen\nwent out into the park and wandered about its lawns and glades. And at last,\nbeing tired and spent, and not altogether free from hunger and thirst, the\nking caught sight of a charming bower, all festooned with the white and\nfragrant bells of creeping plants.\n\n"Come, beloved!" he said to the queen, "here is an arbour that was made for\nrest. Let us enter." And they entered.\n\nBut when he was within, the king saw that the bower only covered the bathing-\nstairs of a bathing pool, which was shaded by some sort of roof that looked\nlike cobweb, and being unspeakably attracted by all the surroundings and the\nsparkling coolness of the waters, he turned to his wife and said gently,\n"Surely no harm would happen to you if you bathed here! Would you not like to\ndo so?"\n\nScarcely were the words uttered than the queen stepped merrily to the water-\nside and took a plunge. The waters closed over her as she dived, and Parikshit\nwaited, half doubtfully, for\n\np. 117\n\nher return. Alas, it was in vain. She did not reappear. The wife he adored was\nlost to him, it seemed, for ever.\n\nMad with anxiety, the king ran hither and thither, searching for his beloved.\nNowhere could he recover any trace of her. He had the lake dragged, but even\nher body was not to be found. Then he ordered that the waters should be baled\nout. But when this had been done, nothing was discovered, save a large frog\nsitting beside a hole.\n\nAt this sight the king leapt to the conclusion that his wife had been devoured\nby frogs, and his wrath against the whole race was without bounds. Wherefore\nhe promulgated an order that throughout his dominions they were to be slain,\nand that no one was to appear before him without a tribute of dead frogs.\n\nSoon in the world of frogs this state of things became evident. Not one of\nthem could appear above ground without the fear of instant death. And the\nwhole tribe was afflicted with unspeakable terror. In their extremity they\nwent in embassy, with the story of their wrongs, to their own king, and he in\nthe guise of a begging friar appeared before the throne of Parikshit, and\nurged him in the name of religious gentleness and mercy to rescind his cruel\norder for the destruction of the poor frogs. But Parikshit, with his whole\nsoul\n\np. 118\n\nfilled with woe for the death of her who was so dear to him, replied only with\nrenewed protestations of anger and revenge. Had the frogs, he said, not\nswallowed up one who was to him as the heart of his heart? Why then should he\never forgive them? Rather than do so he would continue to slay them with a\ncontinually renewed fury. It was surely very far from fitting that a learned\nman should intercede on their behalf.\n\nAs the monarch spoke of the loss he had suffered the seeming beggar before him\nlooked pained and startled. It was clear that he suddenly understood the\nsituation. "Alas, alas!" he said, "thou art under a fascination, O king! Look\nupon me. I am Ayu, the king of the frogs, and she who was thy wife is my\ndaughter Susobhana. She has cast a glamour over thee, who art of the race of\nmen and not of our kindred. She hath indeed the power to cast enchantments. By\nthis her conduct I am deeply grieved!"\n\nBut when Parikshit heard that he had before him the father of his beloved he\nsaid only, "Oh sir, if she is thy daughter, then bestow her upon me! I desire\nnothing save her return."\n\nThen the king of the frogs, standing before Parikshit, summoned his daughter,\nand when she appeared before him he joined her hand to that of the monarch,\nsaying, "Serve and wait upon thy lord!" And Parikshit, feeling out of his\ngreat\n\np. 119\n\nlove for his wife that in her restoration he had obtained as it were the\nsovereignty of the three worlds, bowed down before the king of the frogs, and\ndid him reverence in due form, as the father of his beloved, and with voice\nchoked by joy and tears, said, "Oh how fortunate I am! How fortunate I am!"\nAnd the King of the Frogs, taking leave of his daughter, left them, and\nreturned to that place from which he had come.\n\nNow the King of the Frogs had parted from his daughter in sorrow and grave\ndisapproval of the spell originally cast by her, whereby the innocent king and\nall her own people suffered so deeply; and in the moment of farewell, as is\nthe wont of fathers, he had looked into the future, and instead of blessing\nher, had sternly said, "The fruit of the enchantment that thou so wrongfully\nhast practised will be seen as a flaw in the kingly honour of thy children,\nuntil the magic spell shall be redeemed." This, then, was the doom that hung\nover the dynasty of Parikshit and the frog-maiden, till it should be redeemed.\nAnd they lived happily together, and had three sons, whose names were Sala,\nDala, and Vala. And in fulness of time King Parikshit gave up the world, and,\nplacing his eldest son upon his throne, himself retired into the forest.\n\nNow it happened that Sala, the new king, while out hunting one day, saw a very\nfleet deer, and\n\np. 120\n\nurged his charioteer to drive quickly that he might catch it.\n\nBut the charioteer answered, a It is impossible. Only a pair of Vami horses\ncould have enabled us to overtake that deer!" Now these Vami horses of which\nhe spoke belonged to Vamadeva, a great Brahmin scholar, who lived in the\nashrama beside the Ganges.\n\nAnd when the king heard of them he became possessed of a desire to be driven\nby them, and, going to the ashrama of Vamadeva, he begged that he would lend\nthem to him that he might capture a fleet deer. And the holy man consented to\nthe king\'s using them, but exacted a promise that they should be returned\nimmediately. Alas, the Vami horses proved so excellent that the king coveted\nthem, and forgot his promise, but kept them when his business of hunting was\nover and locked them up in secret stables attached to his palace!\n\nNow when Vamadeva saw that his horses were not returned he became very\nsorrowful, for he felt that the king\'s plighted word could not be trusted.\nAfter waiting for a month, he sent a disciple to the sovereign to receive from\nhim the Vami steeds. But the king told the young man that these horses were\nfit only for the use of kings, and that he could not understand why holy men\nand scholars should expect to possess them.\n\np. 121\n\n[paragraph continues] So the disciple had to return to his master without the\nhorses.\n\nThen Vamadeva himself appeared before the monarch and pleaded with him to\nrender back his property, which he had promised, moreover, to return when his\nneed should be over.\n\nBut the king was obdurate, being unable, by reason of the blemish on his\nbirth, to perceive in their fulness the obligations of the royal honour. He\noffered the rishi anything out of his own stables that he might choose to\ntake; he undertook to appoint Vamadeva the chief priest of the kingdom; he\npromised anything and everything, only he would not give back to their\nrightful owner the horses he coveted.\n\nThen Vamadeva called upon four terrible demons to appear and slay the impious\nking, and even as he was speaking they arose suddenly, armed with lances, and,\nadvancing from the four quarters, felled him to the earth. Thus died Sala the\nking, and Dala his brother reigned in his stead.\n\nNow as soon as there was a convenient time, Vamadeva came before the new king\nand asked that the pair of Vami horses now in the royal stables should be\nbestowed upon him. But Dala, instead of answering, turned to his charioteer\nand ordered him to bring one of his finest arrows, tempered with poison, that\nhe might kill Vamadeva. But when he raised his arm to point the\n\np. 122\n\narrow the Brahmin said quietly, "Thou are not aiming at me, O king! Rather is\nthine arrow pointed against thine own son, Senajit; him art thou about to\nslay."\n\nAs the words were spoken the king let fly his terrible arrow, and at the\nselfsame moment, in the innermost apartments of the palace, the child Senajit\nfell, pierced by the arrow from his father\'s hand.\n\nSuddenly the wail of mourning was heard, and a panic-stricken messenger\narrived to give the king the news of the disaster to his line. But the death\nof his son seemed only to drive Dala to a frenzy of anger. Demanding another\narrow, he called upon gods and men, his own subjects and the denizens of the\nheaven, to be witnesses of the death he was about to deal; and again he raised\nhis arm to take the fatal aim. . . .\n\nTo the amazement of all present, except the Brahmin, who stood as he was, with\neyes fixed on the sovereign, without moving--the bow was not twanged, nor was\nthe arrow shot forth. A look of agony passed over the king\'s face; his hands\nshook, and he stood still. At last with a groan he said, "I am defeated. I am\novercome. I am unable to bring about the death of Vamadeva!" And his right\nhand fell nerveless to his side.\n\nAt this Vamadeva\'s aspect became all gentleness and kindness. "Send for thy\nqueen, O king!"\n\np. 123\n\nsaid he, "and let her touch this arrow that thou didst destine for murder.\nThus mayst thou be purified from the fruit of thy sin."\n\nAnd the king did as he was bidden, sending for his queen. And when she came\nshe did reverence to the sage Vamadeva, and stretched out her hand to take the\npoisoned arrow. And the holy man was much touched by the nobility of her\nbearing and the grace of her salutation, and blessing her, he said, "O thou\nthat art without fault, ask thou of me an incomparable boon. It is mine to\ngrant thee whatever thou shalt ask!"\n\nAnd the queen answered, "I pray that my husband may be freed from his sin, and\nthat I may be ever his helpmeet, to aid him in the growth of happiness and\nvirtue."\n\n"O good as thou art beautiful!" cried the delighted rishi, "thou hast saved\nthis royal house! With thee is the curse departed that was spoken by Ayu, the\nfather of Susobhana. What woman doomed, a woman hath redeemed. Rule thou, O\nprincess, over the hearts of these thy kinsmen, thy husband and thy son, and\nover this great kingdom of Ayodhya. Never, while they honour thee, shall there\nbe loss of kingly honour in the race of Parikshit!"\n\nAnd so saying, and taking back his horses, the rishi departed from the court\nof Dala, the king of Ayodhya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Gopaler-Ma: The Mother of the Christ-Child](seh22.htm)\n\n'
