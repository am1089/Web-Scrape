Now at each place he came to, when he took the pack down\nfrom the ass\'s back, he used to clothe him in a lion\'s skin, and turn him\nloose in the rice and barley fields. And when the watchmen in the fields saw\nthe ass, they dared not go near him, taking him for a lion.\n\nSo one day the hawker stopped in a village; and whilst he was getting his own\nbreakfast cooked, he dressed the ass in a lion\'s skin, and turned him loose in\na barley-field. The watchmen in the field dared not go up to him; but going\nhome, they published the news. Then all the villagers came out with weapons\nin, their hands; and blowing chanks, and beating drums, they went near the\nfield and shouted. Terrified with the fear of death, the ass uttered a cry--\nthe bray of an ass!\n\nAnd when he knew him then to be an ass, the future Buddha pronounced the First\nVerse:\n\n"This is not a lion\'s roaring,  \nNor a tiger\'s, nor a panther\'s;  \nDressed in a lion\'s skin,  \n\'Tis a wretched ass that roars!".\n\nBut when the villagers knew the creature to be an ass, they beat him till his\nbones broke; and, carrying off the lion\'s skin, went away. Then the hawker\ncame; and seeing the ass fallen into so bad a plight, pronounced the Second\nVerse:\n\n"Long might the ass,  \nClad in a lion\'s skin,  \nHave fed on the barley green.  \nBut he brayed!  \nAnd that moment he came to ruin."\n\nAnd even whilst he was yet speaking the ass died on the spot!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Farmer and the Money-Lender](ift22.htm)\n\n'
