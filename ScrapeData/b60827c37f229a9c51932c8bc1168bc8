Or the consequence of the entire (Brahman entering into the effect), and\nstultification of (Brahman's) being devoid of parts.\n\n'Being only was this in the beginning'; 'This indeed was in the beginning not\nanything'; 'The Self alone indeed was this in ihe beginning'--these and other\ntexts state that in the beginning Brahman was one only, i.e. without parts--\nthat means: Brahman, in its causal state, was without parts because then all\ndistinction of matter and souls had disappeared. This one, non-divided,\nBrahman thereupon having formed the resolution of being many divided itself\ninto the aggregate of material things--ether, air, and so on--and the\naggregate of souls from Brahma down to blades of grass. This being so, it must\nbe held that the entire highest Brahman entered into the effected state; that\nits intelligent part divided itself into the individual souls, and its non-\nintelligent part into ether, air, and so on. This however stultifies all those\noften-quoted texts which declare Brahman in its causal state to be devoid of\nparts. For although the cause is constituted by Brahman in so far as having\nfor its body matter and souls in their subtle state, and the effect by Brahman\ninvested with matter and souls in their gross state; the difficulty stated\nabove cannot be avoided, since also that element in Brahman which is embodied\nis held to enter into the effect. If, on the other hand, Brahman is without\nparts, it cannot become many, and it is not possible that there should persist\na part not entering into the effected state. On the ground of these\nunacceptable results we conclude that Brahman cannot be the cause.--This\nobjection the next Sutra disposes of.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 27.
