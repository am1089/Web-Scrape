SANKYA YOGA\xc2\x97YOGA OF THE MIND\n\nOne of the lesser known schools of Yoga which seems to be particularly well\nsuited to our search for relaxation of mind is the Sankya Yoga, based on the\n_sutras_ , or writings, of the sage Kapila. Hindus believe this Yoga\nphilosopher was none other than the god Vishnu, the son of Brahman, in one of\nhis earthly reincarnations. On the surface, the _sutras_ seem to be merely a\nseries of philosophical propositions, yet students of this school affirm that\na study of them will lead to _samadhi_ and mental deliverance.\n\nThe Sankya philosophy states that the ills of life may be palliated by means\ndiscovered from reason, and that final deliverance\xc2\x97the ultimate of what we\nmight call relaxation and harmony with the environment\xc2\x97can be achieved by "a\nmethod consisting in a discriminative knowledge of perceptible principles, and\nthe imperceptible one and the thinking soul."\n\nThe commentaries state: "The accurate discrimination of those principles into\nwhich all that exists is distributed by the Sankya philosophy; _vyakta_ , that\nwhich is perceived,\n\np. 74\n\nsensible, discrete; _avyakta_ , that which is unperceived, indiscrete, and\n_jna_ , that which knows or discriminates. The first is a matter of its\nperceptible modifications; the second is crude, unmodified matter, and the\nthird is soul. The object of the Sankya Yoga is to define and explain these\nthree things, the correct knowledge of which is in itself release from worldly\nbondage and exemption from exposure to human ills, by the final separation of\nsoul and body."\n\nThere is nothing in this school of Yoga of any postures, movements, breath\ncontrol or any effort of the mind save what is implied in any philosophical\nstudy. In other Yogas, knowledge that sets the soul free comes at the end of\nlong, specific courses of practice and in the form of intuition or spiritual\nimpression similar to that in which a saint learns the truth after he has lost\nhis reason in an ecstatic trance. Kapila\'s teaching is addressed to the waking\nreason alone.\n\n#### The 16 Sutras of Kapila\n\nThe practice of Kapila, which dates back to the seventh century of the\nChristian era, consists first of meditation on the following _sutras_. Each\nholds an inner meaning that responds to the individual mind which studies\nthem: (1) An expression of Yoga is to be made; (2) Yoga is the suppression of\nthe transformation of the thinking principle; (3) the seer abides in himself;\n(4) otherwise he becomes assimilated with transformations; (5) the\ntransformations are fivefold, and either painful or not painful; (6) they are\nknown as right knowledge, wrong knowledge, fancy, sleep and memory; (7) right\nknowledge is direct cognition, or interference or testimony; (8) wrong\nknowledge is false conception of a thing whose real form does not answer to it\nin reality; (9) fancy is\n\np. 75\n\nthe notion called into being having nothing to answer to it in reality; (10)\nthat transformation which has nothingness for its basis is sleep; (11) memory\nis not allowing that which is known to escape; (12) suppression of memory is\nsecured by application and non-attachment; (13) application is the effort\ntoward the state ( _stilhi_ ) in which the mind is at a standstill; (14) this\nbecomes a position of firmness, being practiced for a long time without\nintermission and with perfect devotion; (15) the consciousness of having\nmastered every desire, so that one does not thirst for objects perceptible or\nscriptural, is non-attachment; (16) that is highest, wherein from being the\n_purusa_ (soul), there is entire cessation of any desire for the _gunas_\n(things of sense).\n\n#### The Practice\n\nThe practice recommended by Pantajali, one of the earlier followers of this\nschool of Yoga, consists of meditation on the _sutras_ , the exercise of\nfaith, energy, memory and discriminative judgment, ardent desire to attain to\n_samadhi_ , or a trance, constant repetition and intense meditation on the\nmessage of Kapila. There should also be intense concentration on a single\nthing, sympathy with happiness, compassion for misery, complacency toward\nvirtue and indifference to evil. Other means of achieving this state are\nbreathing exercises (Pranayama), and concentration on sensuous enjoyment by\nthose who cannot steady their minds but through a form of sensual pleasure.\nThis is done, according to the text, "by fixing the attention on one of the\nfive senses of smell, taste, color, touch and sound. These are respectively\nreproduced by concentrating on the tip of the nose, the tip of the tongue, the\nforepart of the palate, the middle of the\n\np. 76\n\ntongue, and the root of the tongue. The sensation in each case is not merely a\nflash of pleasurable feeling, but a kind of complete absorption in the\nparticular enjoyment meditated upon."\n\nThere is also concentration on the _joytis_ (light). To help concentration you\nmust imagine that in the heart there is a lotus-like form with eight petals\nwhich has its face turned downward. You must believe that this can be raised\nby exhaling the breath, then meditate upon this thought, while pronouncing the\nmystic sounds A.U.M. The effect of this is that a calm light is seen "like\nthat of the moon or sun, resembling a calm ocean of milk." Concentration may\nalso be on the condition of deep sleep, or finally, according to one\'s own\npredilection\xc2\x97that is to say, on any chosen thing.\n\nSo much for the objects of concentration. The states induced by it and other\nresults will now be considered. The test of proper concentration is acquired\nin "a mastery extending from the finest atom to infinity." The two kinds of\nconcentration are the argumentative, or mixed, and the non-argumentative, or\npure. The latter results in bliss, intuition and revelation.\n\n#### Obstructions\n\nWhile it may seem that the method of Yoga under discussion is an easy path to\nfulfillment and relaxation in its pure sense, it may require time to achieve\nresults. The soul or mind must be purged of distractions or obstructions.\nThese include ignorance, the sense of being, desire, aversion, attachment.\nEach of these may have to be overcome by sincere and sometimes lengthy\nmeditation and self-examination.\n\np. 77\n\n#### Accessories\n\nAccessories along this path are forbearance, observance, posture, regulation\nof breath, abstraction, contemplation, absorption and trance. Each of these\nterms has a specific meaning in Yoga that we will now consider.\n\n_Forbearance_ means abstinence from killing, falsehood, theft, incontinence\nand greediness. _Observance_ means purity, contentment, mortification, study\nand resignation to the authority of a higher divinity. _Posture_ is that which\nis easy and steady. _Regulation of the breath_ is control of the vital body\nforces. _Abstraction_ means drawing away the senses from their objects in the\nsame way that thoughts are drawn away, abstracted from theirs, whence "follows\nthe greatest mastery over the senses." _Contemplation_ means fixing the mind\non something. _Absorption_ means so fixing the mind that it becomes one with\nthe object of contemplation. _Trance_ is when this fixing of the mind is\ncarried so far that the thinker, the thinking and the thing thought of are\none.\n\nThese last three together constitute _samyama_ , which is the way to several\noccult powers and which conducts the Yogi to conscious _samadhi_. The other\nfive accessories are called external means, and are useful only in obviating\ndistractions. As do other schools of Yoga, Kapila adherents claim a list of\n_siddhis_ , or miraculous powers, through the attainment of _samyama_. They\nare:\n\n(1) Knowing the past and the future; (2) recollecting previous incarnations;\n(3) discerning the state of a person\'s mind by outward signs like complexion,\ntone of voice, etc.; (4) reading the thoughts of others; (5) the power to\nbecome invisible; (6) knowing the time of one\'s death by meditating on his\nKarma or by portents such as specters, dreams, etc.;\n\np. 78\n\n[paragraph continues] (7) attracting the good will of others; (8) acquiring\nthe power of an animal, as the strength of an elephant, by meditating on it;\n(9) knowing the "subtle, the remote and the obscure" by contemplating the\ninner light, such as Yogis are able to evoke by performing _rechaka_ , or\nexhalation.\n\nAlso, (10) the knowledge of space by contemplating the sun; (11) knowledge of\nthe starry regions by contemplating the moon; (12) knowledge of the motion of\nthe stars by contemplating the pole-star; (13) knowledge of the internal\narrangement of the body by contemplating the important nerve centers near the\nnavel. (The nerve centers are termed _circles_ , _padmas_ , _chakras_.\nContemplation on these centers is an important part of Yoga practice.); (14)\ndestroying hunger and thirst by contemplating the pit of the throat; (15)\nmaking the body fixed and immovable by contemplating the _karma-nadi_ , a\nnerve in which the vital air is supposed to reside; (16) the power of seeing\nthe things called _siddhas_ , or _mahatmas_ , by contemplating the light in\nthe head. (This is said to appear somewhere near the pineal gland or coronal\nartery, or over the medulla oblongata, and can be seen by concentrating on the\nspace between the eyebrows.); (17) the power to accomplish all of the above by\n_pratibha_ , which is that degree of intellect which develops itself without\nany special cause, generally termed "intuition," and can be developed by\nsimply contemplating the intellect; (18) knowledge of the mind of another or\nof one\'s own by contemplating the nerve center of the heart; (19) knowledge of\none\'s soul as distinct from his mind, by contemplating himself.\n\nThere is another group of _siddhis_ which verge on the preternatural and may\nbe meant literally or figuratively, as they appear in the original manuscripts\nof the school of Yoga. These are: (1) Entrance into and possession of another\nbody,\n\np. 79\n\nwhether living or dead, by discovering through contemplation on the nerves the\nparticular one by which mind can pass in and out; (2) levitation of the body\nand the ability to die at will; (3) effulgence of the body, halos about the\nhead; also clairaudience or the power to hear distant sounds by concentrating\non _akasa_ , the ether conveying sound; (4) ability to pass bodily through\nspace by concentration on the relation between the body and _akasa_ ; (5) the\ncondition known as _mahavideha_ , in which knowledge of every description is\nwithin easy reach of the ascetic and obtainable without effort; (6) mastery\nover the elements by concentrating on their natures respectively; (7) the\nattainments of _anima_ and the other eight _siddhis_ , as also perfection of\nthe body and the corresponding non-obstruction of its functions; (8) beauty,\ngracefulness and strength, adamantine hardness of body; (9) mastery over the\norgans of sense by concentration on their natures; (10) as a result of this\nmastery, fleetness of body equal to that of mind, sensation independent of the\nbody or the organs of sense and the ability to command anything or create\nanything at will; (11) mastery over all things and knowledge of all, by\ncontemplating the distinctive relation of soul and mind; (12) _Kaivalya_ , the\nhighest end, state of oneness, of being one and alone, obtained by renouncing\nattachment to even these ten last-named high occult powers.\n\nIt can be seen that the intense thought required to produce such a system as\nthat of Kapila amounts to mental concentration sufficient to induce a state of\nmind that results in ecstasy and lets in supernal light. Intense and\npersistent devotion as well as hard thinking is required for an understanding\nof this system. The truth or falsity of the preceding propositions have\nnothing to do with the ultimate results.\n\np. 80\n\n[paragraph continues] The formulation described here contains enough\nconcentrated work to carry the adherent to the desired end, though the student\nmay lag behind.\n\nThe disposition that was shown by Kapila to rely on intellectual conviction\xc2\x97a\nreliance condemned by the magicians of old\xc2\x97is manifested at present by many\nschools of so-called magical healers, and on a higher level, perhaps, by lay\nanalysts and psychiatrists, who claim to cure by simply telling the patient\nonly the truth.\n\nNeither truth nor untruth can be shown to have magical power, but\nconcentration on untruth or truth, long continued, will still the mind and\nthereby permit nature to do its work. The principle of Kapila was to set up\nreason against revelation. When, by force of concentration on the construction\nof his system, he had attained to _samadhi_ in its ultimate stage, such\nimpressions confirmed him in his previous conclusions. They revealed to him\nthat release obtained by his methods was complete and final. Naturally, he\nmust have felt that he had both reason and revelation on his side. However,\nreason is no more infallible than its mystical offspring, revelation. The\nmodern Western adherent will be wiser and profit most from Yoga as he\npractices more and theorizes less.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10. Yoga Principles of Diet](rwy11.htm)\n\n'
