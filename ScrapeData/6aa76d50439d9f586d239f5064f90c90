And as there are difficulties in both cases.\n\nEarth has the qualities of smell, taste, colour, and touch, and is gross;\nwater has colour, taste, and touch, and is fine; fire has colour and touch,\nand is finer yet; air is finest of all, and has the quality of touch only. The\nquestion now arises whether the atoms constituting the four elements are to be\nassumed to possess the same greater or smaller\n\np. 394\n\nnumber of qualities as the respective elements.--Either assumption leads to\nunacceptable consequences. For if we assume that some kinds of atoms have more\nnumerous qualities, it follows that their solid size (murti) will be increased\nthereby, and that implies their being atoms no longer. That an increase of\nqualities cannot take place without a simultaneous increase of size we infer\nfrom our observations concerning effected material bodies.--If, on the other\nhand, we assume, in order to save the equality of atoms of all kinds, that\nthere is no difference in the number of their qualities, we must either\nsuppose that they have all one quality only; but in that case we should not\nperceive touch in fire nor colour and touch in water, nor taste, colour, and\ntouch in earth, since the qualities of the effects have for their antecedents\nthe qualities of the causes. Or else we must suppose all atoms to have all the\nfour qualities; but in that case we should necessarily perceive what we\nactually do not perceive, viz. smell in water, smell and taste in fire, smell,\ntaste, and colour in air.--Hence on this account also the atomic doctrine\nshows itself to be unacceptable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 17](sbe34193.htm)\n\n'
