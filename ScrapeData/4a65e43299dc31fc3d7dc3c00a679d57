My copy of the Matsya names but nineteen, and\nthe Radcliffe but twelve; but both agree in making the total thirty-two. They\nall concur with the text also in stating that 1000 years had elapsed from the\ngreat war, at the death of the last Varhadratha prince; and this is more\nworthy of credit than the details, which are obviously imperfect.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXIV](vp117.htm)\n\n'
