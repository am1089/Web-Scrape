Whoever serve Me- as I show Myself-  \nConstantly true, in full devotion fixed,  \nThose hold I very holy. But who serve-  \nWorshipping Me The One, The Invisible,  \nThe Unrevealed, Unnamed, Unthinkable,  \nUttermost, All-pervading, Highest, Sure-  \nWho thus adore Me, mastering their sense,  \nOf one set mind to all, glad in all good,  \nThese blessed souls come unto Me.  \nYet, hard  \nThe travail is for such as bend their minds  \nTo reach th\' Unmanifest. That viewless path  \nShall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh!  \nBut whereso any doeth all his deeds  \nRenouncing self for Me, full of Me, fixed  \nTo serve only the Highest, night and day  \nMusing on Me- him will I swiftly lift  \nForth from life\'s ocean of distress and death,  \nWhose soul clings fast to Me. Cling thou to Me!  \nClasp Me with heart and mind! so shalt thou dwell  \nSurely with Me on high. But if thy thought  \nDroops from such height; if thou be\'st weak to set  \nBody and soul upon Me constantly,  \nDespair not! give Me lower service! I seek  \nTo reach Me, worshipping with steadfast will;  \nAnd, if thou canst not worship steadfastly,  \nWork for Me, toil in works pleasing to Me!  \nFor he that laboureth right for love of Me  \nShall finally attain! But, if in this  \nThy faint heart fails, bring Me thy failure! find  \nRefuge in Me! let fruits of labour go,  \nRenouncing hope for Me, with lowliest heart,  \nSo shalt thou come; for, though to know is more  \nThan diligence, yet worship better is  \nThan knowing, and renouncing better still.  \nNear to renunciation- very near-  \nDwelleth Eternal Peace!\n\nWho hateth nought  \nOf all which lives, living himself benign,  \nCompassionate, from arrogance exempt,  \nExempt from love of self, unchangeable  \nBy good or ill; patient, contented, firm  \nIn faith, mastering himself, true to his word,  \nSeeking Me, heart and soul; vowed unto Me,-  \nThat man I love! Who troubleth not his kind,  \nAnd is not troubled by them; clear of wrath,  \nLiving too high for gladness, grief, or fear,  \nThat man I love! Who, dwelling quiet-eyed,  \nStainless, serene, well-balanced, unperplexed,  \nWorking with Me, yet from all works detached,  \nThat man I love! Who, fixed in faith on Me,  \nDotes upon none, scorns none; rejoices not,  \nAnd grieves not, letting good or evil hap  \nLight when it will, and when it will depart,  \nThat man I love! Who, unto friend and foe  \nKeeping an equal heart, with equal mind  \nBears shame and glory; with an equal peace  \nTakes heat and cold, pleasure and pain; abides  \nQuit of desires, hears praise or calumny  \nIn passionless restraint, unmoved by each;  \nLinked by no ties to earth, steadfast in Me,  \nThat man I love! But most of all I love  \nThose happy ones to whom \'tis life to live  \nIn single fervid faith and love unseeing,  \nDrinking the blessed Amrit of my Being!\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER XII OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Bhaktiyog,"  \nOr "The Book of the Religion of Faith."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13: Of Religion by Separation of Matter and Spirit](bg13.htm)\n\n'
