V.\n\nThe third kind of dissolution, or final liberation from existence. Evils of\nworldly life. Sufferings in infancy, manhood, old age. Pains of hell.\nImperfect felicity of heaven. Exemption from birth desirable by the wise. The\nnature of spirit or god. Meaning of the terms Bhagavat and Vasudeva.\n\nTHE wise man having investigated the three kinds of worldly pain, or mental\nand bodily affliction and the like 1, and having acquired true wisdom, and\ndetachment from human objects, obtains final dissolution. The first of the\nthree pains, or \xc3\x81dhyatmika, is of two kinds, bodily and mental. Bodily pain is\nof many kinds, as you shall hear. Affections of the head, catarrh, fever,\ncholic, fistula, spleen, hemorrhoids, intumescence, sickness, ophthalmia,\ndysentery, leprosy, and many other diseases, constitute bodily affliction.\nMental sufferings are love, anger, fear, hate, covetousness, stupefaction,\ndespair, sorrow, malice, disdain, jealousy, envy, and many other passions\nwhich are engendered in the mind. These and various other afflictions, mental\nor corporeal, are comprised, under the class of worldly sufferings, which is\ncalled \xc3\x81dhyatmika (natural and inseparable). That pain to which, excellent\nBrahman, the term \xc3\x81dhibhautika (natural, but incidental) is applied, is every\nkind of evil which is inflicted (from without) upon men by beasts, birds, men,\ngoblins, snakes, fiends, or reptiles; and the pain that is termed \xc3\x81dhidaivika\n(or superhuman) is the work of cold, heat, wind, rain, lightning, and other\n(atmospherical phenomena). Affliction, Maitreya, is multiplied in thousands of\nshapes in the progress of conception, birth, decay, disease, death, and hell.\nThe tender (and subtile) animal exists in the embryo, surrounded by abundant\nfilth, floating in water, and distorted in its back, neck, and bones; enduring\nsevere pain even in the course of its developement, as disordered by the acid,\nacrid, bitter, pungent, and saline articles of its mother\'s food; incapable of\nextending or contracting\n\np. 639\n\nits limbs; reposing amidst the slime of ordure and urine; every way\nincommoded; unable to breathe; endowed with consciousness, and calling to\nmemory many hundred previous births. Thus exists the embryo in profound\naffliction, bound to the world by its former works.\n\nWhen the child is about to be born, its face is besmeared by excrement, urine,\nblood, mucus, and semen; its attachment to the uterus is ruptured by the\nPrajapati wind; it is turned head downwards, and violently expelled from the\nwomb by the powerful and painful winds of parturition; and the infant losing\nfor a time all sensation, when brought in contact with the external air, is\nimmediately deprived of its intellectual knowledge. Thus born, the child is\ntortured in every limb, as if pierced with thorns, or cut to pieces with a\nsaw, and falls from its fetid lodgment, as from a sore, like a crawling thing\nupon the earth. Unable to feel itself, unable to turn itself, it is dependent\nupon the will of others for being bathed and nourished. Laid upon a dirty bed,\nit is bitten by insects and musquitoes, and has not power to drive them away.\nMany are the pangs attending birth, and many are those which succeed to birth;\nand many are the sufferings which are inflicted by elemental and superhuman\nagency in the state of childhood. Enveloped by the gloom of ignorance, and\ninternally bewildered, man knows not whence he is, who he is, whither he\ngoeth, nor what is his nature; by what bonds [he](errata.htm#29) is bound;\nwhat is cause, and what is not cause; what is to be done, and what is to be\nleft undone; what is to be said, and what is to be kept silent; what is\nrighteousness, what is iniquity; in what it consists, or how; what is right,\nwhat is wrong; what is virtue, what is vice. Thus man, like a brute beast,\naddicted only to animal gratifications, suffers the pain that ignorance\noccasions. Ignorance, darkness, inactivity, influence those devoid of\nknowledge, so that pious works are neglected; but hell is the consequence of\nneglect of religious acts, according to the great sages, and the ignorant\ntherefore suffer affliction both in this world and in the next.\n\nWhen old age arrives, the body is infirm; the limbs are relaxed; the face is\nemaciate and shrivelled; the skin is wrinkled, and scantily covers the veins\nand sinews; the eye discerns not afar off, and the pupil gazes\n\np. 640\n\non vacuity; the nostrils are stuffed with hair; the trunk trembles as it\nmoves; the bones appear beneath the surface; the back is bowed, and the joints\nare bent; the digestive fire is extinct, and there is little appetite and\nlittle vigour; walking, rising, sleeping, sitting, are all painful efforts;\nthe ear is dull; the eye is dim; the mouth is disgusting with dribbling\nsaliva; the senses no longer are obedient to the will; and as death\napproaches, the things that are perceived even are immediately forgotten. The\nutterance of a single sentence is fatiguing, and wakefulness is perpetuated by\ndifficult breathing, coughing, and painful exhaustion. The old man is lifted\nup by somebody else; he is clothed by somebody else; he is an object of\ncontempt to his servants, his children, and his wife. Incapable of\ncleanliness, of amusement, or food, or desire, he is laughed at by his\ndependants, and disregarded by his kin; and dwelling on the exploits of his\nyouth, as on the actions of a past life, he sighs deeply, and is sorely\ndistressed. Such are some of the pains which old age is condemned to suffer. I\nwill now describe to you the agonies of death.\n\nThe neck droops; the feet and hands are relaxed; the body trembles; the man is\nrepeatedly exhausted, subdued, and visited with interrupted knowledge; the\nprinciple of selfishness afflicts him, and he thinks what will become of my\nwealth, my lands, my children, my wife, my servants, my house? the joints of\nhis limbs are tortured with severe pains, as if cut by a saw, or as if they\nwere pierced by the sharp arrows of the destroyer; he rolls his eyes, and\ntosses about his hands and feet; his lips and palate are parched and dry, and\nhis throat, obstructed by foul humours and deranged vital airs, emits a\nrattling sound; he is afflicted with burning heat, and with thirst, and with\nhunger; and he at last passes away, t\xcc\x81ortured by the servants of the judge of\nthe dead, to undergo a renewal of his sufferings in another body. These are\nthe agonies which men have to endure when they die. I will now describe to you\nthe tortures which they suffer in hell.\n\nMen are bound, when they die, by the servants of the king of Tartarus with\ncords, and beaten with sticks, and have then to encounter the fierce aspect of\nYama, and the horrors of their terrible route. In the\n\np. 641\n\ndifferent hells there are various intolerable tortures with burning sand,\nfire, machines, and weapons; some are severed with saws, some roasted in\nforges, some are chopped with axes, some buried in the ground, some are\nmounted on stakes, some cast to wild beasts to be devoured, some are gnawed by\nvultures, some torn by tigers, some are boiled in oil, some rolled in caustic\nslime, some are precipitated from great heights, some tossed upwards by\nengines. The number of punishments inflicted in hell, which are the\nconsequences of sin, is infinite 2.\n\nBut not in hell alone do the souls of the deceased undergo pain: there is no\ncessation even in heaven; for its temporary inhabitant is ever tormented with\nthe prospect of descending again to earth. Again is he liable to conception\nand to birth; he is merged again into the embryo, and repairs to it when about\nto be born; then he dies, as soon as born, or in infancy, or in youth, or in\nmanhood, or in old age. Death, sooner or later, is inevitable. As long as he\nlives he is immersed in manifold afflictions, like the seed of the cotton\namidst the down that is to be spun into thread. In acquiring, losing, and\npreserving wealth there are many griefs; and so there are in the misfortunes\nof our friends. Whatever is produced that is most acceptable to man, that,\nMaitreya, becomes a seed whence springs the tree of sorrow. Wife, children,\nservants, house, lands, riches, contribute much more to the misery than to the\nhappiness of mankind. Where could man, scorched by the fires of the sun of\nthis world, look for felicity, were it not for the shade afforded by the tree\nof emancipation? Attainment of the divine being is considered by the wise as\nthe remedy of the threefold class of ills that beset the different stages of\nlife, conception, birth, and decay, as characterized by that only happiness\nwhich effaces all other kinds of felicity, however abundant, and as being\nabsolute and final 3.\n\nIt should therefore be the assiduous endeavour of wise men to attain unto god\n4. The means of such attainment are said, great Muni, to be\n\np. 642\n\nknowledge and works. Knowledge is of two kinds, that which is derived from\nscripture, and that which is derived from reflection. Brahma that is the word\nis composed of scripture; Brahma that is supreme is produced of reflection 5.\nIgnorance is utter darkness, in which knowledge, obtained through any sense\n(as that of hearing), shines like a lamp; but the knowledge that is derived\nfrom reflection breaks upon the obscurity like the sun. What has been said by\nManu, when appealing to the meaning of the Vedas with respect to this subject,\nI will repeat to you. There are two (forms of) spirit (or god), the spirit\nwhich is the word, and the spirit which is supreme. He who is thoroughly\nimbued with the word of god obtains supreme spirit 6. The Atharva Veda also\nstates that there are two kinds of knowledge; by the one, which is the\nsupreme, god is attained; the other is that which consists of the Rich and\nother Vedas 7. That which is imperceptible, undecaying, inconceivable, unborn,\ninexhaustible, indescribable; which has neither form, nor hands, nor feet;\nwhich is almighty, omnipresent, eternal; the cause of all things, and without\ncause; permeating all, itself unpenetrated, and from which all things proceed;\nthat is the object which the wise behold, that is Brahma, that is the supreme\nstate, that is the subject of contemplation to those who desire liberation,\nthat is the thing spoken of by the Vedas, the infinitely subtile, supreme\ncondition of Vishn\xcc\x81u. That essence of the\n\np. 643\n\nsupreme is defined by the term Bhagavat 8: the word Bhagavat is the\ndenomination of that primeval and eternal god: and he who fully understands\nthe meaning of that expression, is possessed of holy wisdom, the sum and\nsubstance of the three Vedas. The word Bhagavat is a convenient form to be\nused in the adoration of that supreme being, to whom no term is applicable;\nand therefore Bhagavat expresses that supreme spirit, which is individual,\nalmighty, and the cause of causes of all things. The letter _Bh_ implies the\ncherisher and supporter of the universe. By _ga_ is understood the leader,\nimpeller, or creator. The dissyllable _Bhaga_ indicates the six properties,\ndominion, might, glory, splendour, wisdom, and dispassion. The purport of the\nletter _va_ is that elemental spirit in which all beings exist, and which\nexists in all beings 9. And thus this great word Bhagavan is the name of\nVasudeva, who is one with the supreme Brahma, and of no one else. This word\ntherefore, which is the general denomination of an adorable object, is not\nused in reference to the supreme in a general, but a special signification.\nWhen applied to any other (thing or person) it is used in its customary or\ngeneral import. In the latter case it may purport one who knows the origin and\nend and revolutions of beings, and what is wisdom, what ignorance. In the\nformer it denotes wisdom, energy, power, dominion, might, glory, without end,\nand without defect.\n\nThe term Vasudeva means that all beings abide in that supreme being, and that\nhe abides in all beings 10, as was formerly explained by Ke\xc5\x9bidhwaja to\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikya, called Janaka, when he inquired of him an explanation of the name\nof the immortal, Vasudeva. He said, "He\n\np. 644\n\ndwelleth internally in all beings, and all things dwell in him; and thence the\nlord Vasudeva is the creator and preserver of the world. He, though one with\nall beings, is beyond and separate from material nature (Prakriti), front its\nproducts, from properties, from imperfections: he is beyond all investing\nsubstance: he is universal soul; all the interstices of the universe are\nfilled up by him: he is one with all good qualities; and all created beings\nare endowed with but a small portion of his individuality. Assuming at will\nvarious forms, he bestows benefits on the whole world, which was his work.\nGlory, might, dominion, wisdom, energy, power, and other attributes, are\ncollected in him. Supreme of the supreme, in whom no imperfections abide, lord\nover finite and infinite, god in individuals and universals, visible and\ninvisible, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, almighty. The wisdom, perfect,\npure, supreme, undefiled, and one only, by which he is conceived,\ncontemplated, and known, that is wisdom; all else is ignorance."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[638:1](vp160.htm#fr_1622) The three kinds of affliction, inseparable,\nincidental, and superhuman, are fully described in the commentary on the first\nverse of the Sankhya Karika, p. 8, in a similar strain as that which is\nadopted in the text.\n\n[641:2](vp160.htm#fr_1623) Some further particulars of the different hells,\nand the punishments inflicted in them, have been given before: see [p.\n207](vp064.htm#page_207).\n\n[641:3](vp160.htm#fr_1624) All this is conformable to the Sankhya doctrines in\nparticular, although the same spirit pervades all Hindu metaphysics.\n\n[641:4](vp160.htm#fr_1625) Tasmat Tat praptaye yatna kartavya p. 642\npan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81itairnaraih. The expression Tat praptaye, \'for the obtaining of _that_\n,\' refers to the phrase immediately preceding, Bhagavatprapti, \'obtaining of,\'\nor \'attaining to, Bhagavat,\' the lord.\n\n[642:5](vp160.htm#fr_1626) Brahma is of two kinds; \xc5\x9aabda-Brahma, spirit or god\nto be attained through the word, that is, the Vedas and the duties they\nprescribe; and Para-Brahma, spirit or god to be attained through reflection,\nby which the difference between soul and matter is ascertained.\n\n[642:6](vp160.htm#fr_1627) This seems intended as a quotation from Manu, but\nit has not been found in the code; it is ###.\n\n[642:7](vp160.htm#fr_1628) The commentator quotes other passages from the\nVedas of a similar tendency, intimating, however, the necessity of performing\nacts prior to attaining knowledge; as, \'The decoction (preparatory process)\nbeing digested by rites, thereafter knowledge is the supreme resource.\'\n\'Having crossed the gulph of death by ignorance (ceremonial acts), man obtains\nimmortality by (holy) knowledge.\'\n\n[643:8](vp160.htm#fr_1629) According to the comment, allusion is here made to\nthe twelve syllable Mantra, or mystic formula addressed to Vishn\xcc\x81u: \'Om\nBhagavate Vasudevaya nama; \'Om! salutation to Bhagavat Vasudeva:\' the\nrepetition of which, by those devoted (bhakta) to Vishn\xcc\x81u, is the easy mode of\nsecuring their liberation." The mysticism is, however, no doubt older than the\nworship of Vishn\xcc\x81u; and the term Bhagavat is defined in the text according to\nthe interpretation of the Vedas.\n\n[643:9](vp160.htm#fr_1630) The commentator says these interpretations are from\nthe Nirukta, the glossary of the Vedas. The more etymological derivation of\nthe term is, Bhaga, \'power,\' \'authority,\' and vat possessive affix.\n\n[643:10](vp160.htm#fr_1631) From the root Vas, \'abiding,\' \'dwelling\' See p.\n[1](vp035.htm#page_1) and [9](vp036.htm#page_9).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VI](vp161.htm)\n\n'
