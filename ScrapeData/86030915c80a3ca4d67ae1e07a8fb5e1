The man in the street cannot, as a rule,\ndistinguish between the lower and the higher forms of mysticism. He looks upon\nmysticism in general with some kind of superstitious awe or reverence, and he\nthinks of it as an obscure and supernatural method by which, in some\nunaccountable manner, miraculous feats may be performed or physical advantages\nreaped--departed spirits made visible, fortunes told, muscles developed,\nriches earned without effort, dangerous and incurable diseases cured by simple\namulets or blessings, infallible prophesies made, and the like. I shall not\nsay anything as to whether or not such phenomena are possible, for my present\ninterest concerns not facts but beliefs. But whether or not the phenomena\nactually occur, they imply beliefs that there are short cuts to the attainment\nof advantages through mysterious, supernatural or miraculous powers\nundiscoverable by reason. I refer to this as inferior mysticism, because the\npurposes relate solely to the attainment of inferior\n\np. viii\n\nmundane benefits. Distinguishable therefrom is the belief that the highest\nreality or the ultimate realisation and fulfilment (whatever may be their\nnature) cannot be attained by reason alone, but that there are other avenues\nto them, namely, the firm and steady control of will, the development of right\nemotions, or both combined, or by them both along with the highest functioning\nof reason. This is superior and true mysticism because it is directed to the\nliberation of the spirit and the attainment of the highest bliss.\n\nMysticism in Europe has a definite history. In spite of the variety of its\ntypes, it may roughly be described to refer to the belief that God is realised\nthrough ecstatic communion with Him. With the Islamic mystics, the Christian\nmystics, and the devotional mystics or bhaktas of India, the vision of God and\nHis grace is attained through devotional communion or devotional rapture of\nvarious kinds. But in all these mystics, we find a keen sense of the necessity\nof purity of mind, contentment, ever alert striving for moral goodness, self-\nabnegation, and one-pointedness to God. There can be no true mysticism without\nreal moral greatness. This mysticism should therefore be distinguished from a\nmere delusory faith that God often grants us a vision of Him or appears to us\nin dreams, or from a faith in the infallibility of the scriptures and so\nforth, for the latter are often but manifestations of credulity or of a\ntendency to believe in suggestions, and may often be associated with an\ninadequate alertness of critical and synthetic intellect.\n\np. xi\n\nI have defined mysticism as a belief or a view, but in reality it means much\nmore than that. In the life of the true mystics, beliefs exert a great\nformative influence. They are no mere intellectual registrations of opinions\nor temporary experiences, but represent the dynamic, the dominant tone of\ntheir personality as it develops and perfects itself. Mysticism is not an\nintellectual theory; it is fundamentally an active, formative, creative,\nelevating and ennobling principle of life. I have not here taken note of poems\nor thoughts involving merely mystical beliefs but have touched only upon those\nwhich are the outward expressions of a real inner flowering of life in the\npersons of those who have tried to live a saintly life of mysticism.\n\nMysticism means a spiritual grasp of the aims and problems of life in a much\nmore real and ultimate manner than is possible to mere reason. A developing\nlife of mysticism means a gradual ascent in the scale of spiritual values,\nexperience, and spiritual ideals. As such, it is many-sided in its\ndevelopment, and as rich and complete as life itself. Regarded from this point\nof view, mysticism is the basis of all religions--particularly of religion as\nit appears in the lives of truly religious men.\n\nAn acquaintance with Indian religious experience shows that there are types of\nreligious and mystical experience other than that of an intimate communion\nwith God. I have therefore made my definition of mysticism wider, so that it\nmay include not only the Islamic, Christian, and the Bhakti forms of Indian\n\np. x\n\nmysticism but other types of Indian mysticism as well. I could not hope to\ngive an exhaustive analysis or even a fairly comprehensive treatment of the\nchief features of the different types of Indian mysticism within the limits of\nthese six lectures. I have therefore attempted only a brief general outline of\nsome of the most important types, indicating their mutual relations, sometimes\ngenetically and sometimes logically. I have omitted all reference to the\nconnected metaphysical issues, as a comprehensive treatment of these\nphilosophical problems may be found in my "A History of Indian Philosophy"\n(Cambridge University Press), the first volume of which has already been\npublished and the other volumes are in the course of publication.\n\nI have first described the sacrificial type of mysticism. This cannot in all\nits particulars be regarded as a mysticism of a superior order, but it\ndevelops many features of the higher types and marks the starting-point of the\nevolution of Indian mysticism. I have then discussed the four chief types of\nmysticism: the Upanishad, the Yogic, the Buddhistic and the Bhakti, though\nthere are many branches of these particular types upon which I could not\nenter. I have mentioned some other minor types of mysticism. In addition there\nare some which are of a syncretistic nature, exhibiting elements of belief and\nduties of two or three distinct types of mysticism in combination. I could not\npresent them all. The five main types that I have here described, however, may\nbe regarded as fundamental;\n\np. xi\n\nand, though very much more could have been said in the way of elaboration and\nillustration, all their striking characteristics have been briefly touched\nupon and materials have largely been drawn directly from the original sources.\nI hope that I may in the future have an opportunity to take up the subject\nagain and to deal with it more elaborately.\n\nPerhaps I should have entitled the present volume "The Development of Indian\nMysticism." But the word "Indian" might be misunderstood in America. I have\ntherefore selected "Hindu Mysticism," "Hindu" standing for Indian. I have\ndropped the word "Development" to avoid any initial impression of forbidding\ntechnicality. For similar reasons diacritical marks have been omitted.\n\nI now have the very pleasant duty of thanking the Harris Foundation Lecture\nCommittee which did me the honour of asking me to deliver these lectures and\nPresident Walter Dill Scott, Professor Edward L. Schaub and Professor T. W.\nKoch, the Secretary of the committee. Considering the high reputation of my\npredecessors, who were outstanding scholars in their respective branches of\nlearning, I feel extremely diffident about my own humble performance. I have\nreceived so much hospitality and kindness in America that I shall always think\nof this great country with appreciative enthusiasm and admiration. But I can\nnever express adequately my gratefulness and thanks to Professor Edward L.\nSchaub, who was chiefly responsible for my invitations to the American\nUniversities\n\np. xii\n\nand who helped me so generously in seeing these lectures through the press, as\nwell as in suggesting many changes of style and expression--to say nothing of\nhis personal courtesies and cordiality which will always endear his name to\nme.\n\nS.
