Zeus\nbows to her power. She surpasses iron in hardness.--EURIPEDES\' _Alcestis_.  \nHeredity is a condition, not a destiny.--BJ\xc3\x96RNSON.  \nAs a man casts off worn-out clothes, and puts on others which are new, so the\nembodied casts off worn-out bodies, and puts on others which are new.--\n_Bhagavad Git a_.\n\nTHE crucial feature of the Greek conception of life was the dramatic\ndistinction which it made between will and the conditions with which will had\nto cope. Just as surely as our birth on the planet Earth gives us a place,\ndefinite, however infinitesimal, in the solar system, relating us in our\ndegree to all that occurs within the orbit of the farthest satellite, so it is\nclear that our position, geographically, ethnologically, historically, upon\nthat planet, places us from the beginning at definite points on lines of cause\nand effect, to which, as human beings, we can but exercise the function of\nacceptance. This Not-to-be-refused, which modern science calls natural law,\nwas simply to the Greek an unexplained and unexplored Necessity or Fate.\n\nTo the ancients, a curse, for example, was no exercise of the volition of the\nspeaker. It was in no sense a threat. Our own more frivolous use of the word\nis a case of degradation by the death of a conception. To the old Greek, as\nindeed to the\n\np. 179\n\n[paragraph continues] Hindu and the Norseman, a curse was entirely a prophecy.\nIt was pronounced by way of warning or revelation that upon a certain act\ncertain results would be found to follow Apollo perceives that if Laios begets\na son, disaster will result. He does not determine that it shall be so.\nEvidently, will is regarded as free up to a certain point, or we should not\nhave the alternative imagined, of begetting no son. But to \xc5\x92dipus and his\nchildren there is no alternative; he and they have been born in that circle of\ndestiny where they can only fulfil the lot marked out.\n\nThis fact the Greek mind appears to accept without further inquiry For it,\noverwhelming interest attaches, not to an analysis of the nature and\nconditions of fate, but to the spectacle of the human will in spiritual\nconflict with it. This spectacle is the theme of the whole of Hellenic\ntragedy. The Christian doctrine of grace introduces something confused and\nmiraculous into the European idea of life, and for centuries the pursuit of\nthe knowledge of things as they are is thwarted by a supernatural-metaphysic\nof things as they ought to be, and are not. With the Renaissance, however, the\nintellect of Europe springs back sharply to the Greek position. _Macbeth_ and\n_Othello_ are in some ways as completely Hellenic as anything of \xc3\x86schylus.\nTemptation is once more placed outside a man; true and false incentives are\ninextricably blended; and the will is shown as the mere plaything of its own\nblindness. On these points, and in the feeling of vastness with which he\ncovers his subject, Shakespeare\'s delineation is all Greek.\n\nIn _Macbeth_ , it is true, a sense of ethical suffering somewhat blurs the\noutline. But nothing dims the perfect beauty of _Othello_. Untortured by\nmisgiving its heroic figures move from the dawn of their love to the noontide\nof supreme vindication of its purity\n\np. 180\n\nin death. The particular problem is not antique. Its delicacy of tint is\nsomewhat modern, but in simplicity and grandeur, in the conviction that life\nis a mere straw swept along on the current of necessity _Othello_ is an\nancient drama.\n\nOne great difference between the Hellenisms of antiquity and of the\nRenaissance lay in the fact that organisation was at the disposal of the\nmodern. Isolated genius writes dramas, elaborates philosophies, or carves\nstatues: organised genius produces scientific inquiry. In some sense modern\nscience is nothing but the efficient development of the Aristotelian and\nAlexandrian elements of classical thought. The human will itself, however, is\nthe one thing eternally baffling to human research. There is no crucible in\nwhich it can be melted. All science, therefore, resolves itself into the old\nproblem of the Greek dramatist--the problem of due observation of the\nconditions which confront the will; and it is by a strictly logical\ndevelopment of the thought of the ancients--a thought which scarcely dreamt of\nany distinction between a man and his body--that we arrive at the modern\nconception of body-and-brain as the last and crucially important element of\ndestiny.\n\nIts _na ivete_ is at once the strength and weakness of European thought. The\nsprings of modern fiction are still brackish with the salt of our enthusiasm\nabout heredity. Recent talk of degeneration is little more than the bitterness\nleft within a cup. Like every single truth mistaken for the whole, heredity\nwould impose as great a bondage on the human spirit as any system of fatalism.\nOf what use the fight against the weakness or ignorance of one\'s ancestors?\nWhat hope of victory over the taint that is in the blood? And yet, high over\nall law and all instruments rose, rises, and shall for ever rise, the human\nwill, its brow bright with the sunshine\n\np. 181\n\nof freedom, its foot on the foe that our subtle criticism had pronounced\ninvincible, serene in the knowledge of its own power to defy alike heredity\nand the nature-of-things, and make for itself out of the web of failure the\nmantle of a supreme victory.\n\nBut this will so often seems asleep! Unaroused, or ignorant as a child, it has\nturned aside perhaps for every wayside flower, for any shining pebble, and in\nthe hour of the crisis is simply missing. Or it may be that it suffers from\nsome base intoxication of falsehood or desire, and has fallen down to kiss the\nfeet of evil as though it were good, courting slavery and defeat as maidens to\nbe caressed. Surely here, and here alone, is the crux of things, in the\ndifference between the enlightened and the unenlightened will. Necessity is\nbut the sum of the conditions. Heredity is but one, though the most critical,\nof those conditions. In the setting of the will itself towards bondage or\ntowards freedom lies the secret of the unity of life.\n\nThere are thus three factors in the interpretation of human life, and it has\nbeen the distinction of Asiatic thought to have recognised all three. A\nprofound certitude that cause must sooner or later be followed by effect,\nwhile effect has as surely been preceded by cause, gives to the Indian\ntemperament an air of quiet resignation which is far from being the inactive\nfatalism so commonly supposed. For there is surely the difference of extremes\nbetween a dignified acceptance of things because they are unaccountable and\nnot to be interfered with, and a similar dignified acceptance because they are\nso entirely accountable that events require no acceleration!\n\nThat India understands the doctrine of heredity is demonstrated by caste.\nThere alone, amongst all the countries of the world, it has been held for ages\n\np. 182\n\nan unpardonable social dishonour to allow the diseased or deformed or mentally\nalienated to marry. For such, the quietly enforced decree of caste has been\nalways--no posterity. But more than this, the very meaning of the institution\nis, amongst other things, the attempt to develop still further the brain of\nthe Brahmin, the hand of the toolbearer, and every form of expert faculty. It\nis true that it rejects the _crossing_ of blood as a means to this end, but it\nlooks to the cumulative influence of careful selection from generation to\ngeneration, to that of the occupational environment, and to the inheritance of\nthe effects of clean-feeding. The last is held specially important to the user\nof the brain: hence the Brahmin represents more than any other the fibre\nproduced by countless generations of care in this respect, and the lower we go\nin society the less do we find of such transmission.\n\nBut the Indian comprehension of the nature of things and of heredity as\ncomplementary elements in the scheme presented to the will has never meant\nblindness to the last and most important consideration of all--the efficiency\nof the will itself. If this were not the determining factor, India would say,\nit would not be possible, as it is, to watch two brothers, with the same\ninheritance, the same material opportunities, and the same moral environment,\njourney, one to glory and the other to shame, by a common road. And if it were\nnot also the ultimate standard of success or failure, the Greek story of\nAristides, for instance, would lose all its pathos\xe2\x80\x9e For we all know how, when\nan ignorant man asked his help in casting his vote for the condemnation of\nAristides, the great man first complied with his request, and then, on mildly\ninquiring its reason, was answered, "I am tired of hearing him called \'the\njust.\'"\n\nIs it here, or in the story of Dives and Lazarus, that we catch a glimpse of\ninequality? Which is\n\np. 183\n\nthe crueller perplexing of our sense of justice--that one man receives wealth\nand another poverty, or that one cannot wish well, nor another ill?\n\nThe answer of India is not doubtful. There is one tool and only one, she says,\nthat is finer than the most perfect human brain, and that is the tool of a\nnoble intention. No more than other delicate instruments is this, she claims,\nimmediately producible wherever we may wish to see it. Just as faculty grows\nfrom feeble and unrationalised to its perfection, just as organisms progress\nfrom minute and simple to large and complex, so must we suppose that will\npasses through all the stages of egotism till it reaches that illumination\nwhich we know as perfect charity. At each stage the possibilities of\naspiration are limited, though they become less and less so as the goal is\napproached. The whole Hindu outlook is thus critical and scientific. There is\nno longer a vague horrible something called sin: this has given place to a\nclearly defined state of ignorance, or blindness of the will. Nor is this\nignorance conceived of as a stationary or fixed quantity. So surely as trees\ngrow and rivers seek the sea will it sooner or later give place to knowledge,\nin every human soul; and then a man\'s mere forgetfulness of his limited\npersonality and its aims may look to others like nobility: to himself it will\nnot even be apparent, lost in the larger yearning of more universal life. Thus\na great and generous thought is like a position near the river-mouth to the\nwater springing at the source, not by any means to be reached without\ntraversing the complete distance. The supreme good fortune possible to man\nwould consist of a noble intention, joined to a great brain, joined to an\nexternal position of mastery and freedom an advantageous point, that is to\nsay, on some line of cause and effect. Such, we may take it, to Gautama the\nBuddha, was the opportunity of his\n\np. 184\n\nbirth. Most lives, however, represent every possible degree, and combination\nof degrees, of the three conditions. We see the great position made the\nbackground of stupidity and meanness, We see the kind wish rendered futile by\nfeebleness of intellect. Very occasionally there is no discord between person\nand circumstance; but now and again the discrepancy takes the acute form of\nthe lion caught in the net, or the common criminal wearing an emperor\'s crown.\nWhence have these anomalies arisen? In what firm order do they stand rooted?\n\nThe Hindu mind seems always to have been possessed of the quiet confidence\nthat all phenomena will yield themselves to a rational explanation. Since\n"that which exists is one," it is absurd to suppose an ultimate contradiction\nbetween the human reason and the universe. The mind that is normal and right\namongst its fellows is normal and right in its relation to things. If we see\nand hear and taste, it is because in primal vibration there is something\ncorrespondent to sight and sound and the rest, of which our human sense has\nbeen the necessary outcome. Our faculty, that is to say, may be feeble, but we\nmust assume it to be true. If thirty years of life can impress us with a sense\nof terrible duration, utterly disproportionate to their relative importance,\nit is because in the Absolute there is no passage of time, all the infinite\neternities of consciousness lying in the Now. If human love can oppress us\nwith a vastness undreamed of, suddenly opened before us, it is because in it\nwe have approximated to a state which transcends all limit and all change.\nWhatever be the nature of the Real it must include, not exclude,\nconsciousness. This being so, we must take it that the order of things as we\nsee them--time, space, and causation--applies to life itself as naturally as\nto all that\n\np. 185\n\nwithin the limits of life we perceive. Our appearance here from birth to death\nis a simple case of the sequences that every moment of our stay brings to our\nnotice. It is the effect of some cause which could no more have failed to find\nits fulfilment in time and space than the self-striking of a bird\'s wing could\nfail to be accompanied by flight. Everything, again, within the general\neffect, is a subordinate effect conditioned by its own subordinate cause.\nPhysical, mental, and moral, are only terms denoting so many dimensions, as it\nwere, within which the seed has germinated and come to its fruition. So much\nfor the effect. Do things, as we see them, give us any hint as to the nature\nof the cause? Yes, there is one force--the force of desire--that we see at\nwork daily, making, cherishing, gathering, action and its fruits. Without this\nas creative antecedent it will be found on examination that nothing that we\nknow of comes to pass. Hence if life as a whole be regarded as but a\nphenomenon similar in kind to those which it encloses, we are impelled to the\nconclusion that of it also the efficient cause has been the human will. We\ndreamed of ourselves as bodies. Falling into some strange error, we longed for\nthe sweets of sense. And we awoke and, without knowing it, found ourselves in\nprison, there but to continue adding to the energy of those desires, each of\nwhich was already a fetter binding us the faster. Such is the Hindu\ninterpretation of our presence here. Of what led to our self-deceit he\nattempts no account, conceiving that his right to a rational theory applies\nonly to the phenomenal, meaning those things that are perceived within the\nplay of reason.\n\nThus, life is a harvest reaped at birth. It is also the sowing of fresh\nharvests for the painful reaping of the future. Every act is as a seed, effect\nof past cause, cause of effect to come-- _Karma_. The unending\n\np. 186\n\nwheel of birth and change and death. For the Hindu does not consider that a\nsingle life alone is to be accounted for. The very constitution of our minds\nforces on us the idea that phenomena are cyclic; that appearances recur; that\nthe starry Universe itself blooms and will wither like another flower. Clearly\nthen the causes that have placed us here to-day must bring us again; must, in\nthe circling of infinite ages, have brought us infinite times before. This is\nthe doctrine of Reincarnation. Our ignorance now tells of a deeper ignorance\nin the past. The desires that burn within us are but our subjective\napprehension of what is yet to be. For that which we long for must come to our\nhand. The _Karma_ of each birth is only the harvest of our ancient wishes.\n\nWhat the victim of desire so constantly forgets, however, is the twofold\nnature of things, and their constant state of flux. Good brings evil; wealth\nis succeeded by poverty: love is but a messenger sent before the feet of\nsorrow. In fact, the seeming benefits of material things are in reality\nscourges, sooner or later to lash the very back of him who drew them to\nhimself. None, for instance, could be so puerile as to declare palaces,\njewels, and horses as good in themselves, so that their chance possession now\nand again should be any compensation for the suffering of requiring them. It\nis little more exalted, says the Hindu, to claim love, intellect, and\nsalvation, as necessities. The world of Maya consists of the perpetual\nalternation of opposites. Every desire carries its fulfilment, its decay, and\nits retribution hidden within itself. That what we would have we must first\ngive, is the lesson of austerity.\n\nThe Karma of an individual, then, consists of a given condition of taste or\nknowledge, a given physical equipment, and a given share of material fortune\nor misfortune. Taste sometimes rises to\n\np. 187\n\ngenius, or sinks to brutish appetite. The physical equipment may include a\nmathematician\'s brain, a violinist\'s hand, or a body tortured by perverse\ntemptations. In any case, according to the theory, the will that has come to\nadminister, earned exactly that endowment, and in this respect life is justly\ndistributed. It is thought not unnatural that the soul of a Bach should seek\nincarnation in a family of musicians, since here it could best find the\nconditions it demanded. With regard to such matters, a vast lore has been\naccumulated, into which it is interesting to dip. There is a popular belief\namongst Hindus that marriage is always contracted between the same two\npersons, and that the merit of either is divided equally with the other.\nHowever this may be, love at first sight--an occasional experience the world\nover!--is held a sure proof of past friendship and acquaintance. Very perfect\nrelationships, by which is meant, amongst other things, those that are complex\nin their quality, would be considered in the same way, to be long-rooted. The\nreligious life is one of the most fascinating subjects of speculation. It will\nsometimes happen that the stern ascetic in the midst of his austerities yields\nto, or at least harbours, some vain desire. This is enough to precipitate him\nonce more into the world, where his position and power will be exactly equal\nto the severity of his past renunciations. He may thus very easily become a\nmonarch, and it is believed that a faint memory of the religious habit often\nhaunts the throne. The great Akbar of Delhi told of such a reminiscence in his\nown case. He had been a monastic novice, and had fallen in love! When\nsovereignty was exhausted, however, he would return to his prayers and gain\nfreedom, without another fall. An impression of this kind about Queen Victoria\nwas the real secret of the influence of her name in India--an influence, be it\nadded, which\n\np. 188\n\nwould have been much deepened had she succeeded in abdicating some few years\nbefore her death, in order to devote the rest of her life to God.\n\nWe must remember, however, that the Oriental, born to the idea of re-\nincarnation, rarely becomes so infatuated with it as to make it his sole\ndependence in interpreting life. He does not lose his head over it, as may one\nwho hears of it for the first time. He is well aware that, on his own\nhypothesis, we are engaged in the sowing of seed, as well as the reaping of\ngrain. He will not therefore attempt to explain every new introduction from an\nimaginary past. This life is to him but one measure in a long passage of\nmusic. The great majority of its tones gain all their beauty and meaning from\nthe fact that they wet e prepared beforehand and will be resolved after, but\nsome nevertheless are new. That we do not, as a rule, remember our pasts is,\nhe argues, no disproof of their existence, since neither do we remember our\nbirth and infancy.\n\nIt is this clearness of logical speculation that lends its terror to the\nIndian notion of existence. To the wise man, frankly, life is a bondage, and\nthe only question how to be freed from it. Suicide cannot solve the problem.\nThe reasons for this act may be frivolous or weighty. It is an instrument as\nmuch within a man\'s own power as the tools of his calling or the weapons of\nself-defence. Only, it offers no escape from the misery of existence. Can the\nschoolboy make progress in arithmetic by wiping from his slate the sum he\ncould not work? Will not that particular difficulty recur whenever he would\ntake an onward step, confusing, taunting, blinding him, till it is conquered?\nEven so is the lot of the suicide, thinks the Hindu. He desired to escape the\nrope of justice? Then in some future incursion into life it will become his\n_Karma_ to stand on the scaffold and undergo the extreme penalty, for a crime\nhe has\n\np. 189\n\nnot committed. He would flee from a dishonour he had not strength to endure?\nNo coward\'s self-banishment shall suffice to save him. Sooner or later the\nordeal must be met and faced. Or was it the abstract hatred of life that used\nhis own hand to slay the man? Fool! saw he not that the act was part and\nparcel of an extreme self-indulgence, and must bring its terrible consequence\nof exile from all that could make existence beautiful and blessed?\n\nDesire, in short, is the ego-centripetal, the self-assertive, self-regarding\nforce. The current must be turned out deliberately, not drawn inward. The\npassion for self must be destroyed in the thirst for service. Desire must be\nburnt to ashes in the fires of renunciation. Then, and then only, will there\nbe escape from the incessant turning of the wheel. Then alone can the victim\nbecome the conqueror, and the slave master of the world.\n\nThis is the "cosmic suicide" of Schopenhauer, the much talked-of "pessimism"\nof the East. It is indeed a familiar conception to all Hindus, so familiar as\nto be an integral part of language. But it is hardly "pessimism." Does the\nprophecy of victory carry with it sadness? the certain promise of his freedom\nembitter the slave? There is a sense in which, if Hindu philosophy be not\noptimistic, it is difficult to know what the world means by optimism. Taking\nthe doctrine of reincarnation as a whole, we find it so necessary to the\ntheory of _Maya_ that even the Buddhist formulation could not exist without\nsome version of it. At the same time, a clear understanding of it is a\nvaluable corrective of slipshod misconceptions as to the philosophy of\nillusion. That this involves no lazy intellectual uncertainty regarding\nphenomena we have seen, since the whole doctrine of _Karma_ is based on the\nHindu\'s implicit conviction of the entire calculableness of law. It\n\np. 190\n\ncannot be too clearly understood that the argument of _Maya_ is compatible\nwith, and tenacious of, the severest scientific research, and that to Oriental\nthinking, only that man who has in his own person, by some method of self-\ndiscipline, achieved a realisation, compared to which all that we know through\nthe senses is unreal, has a right to speak of the phenomenal universe as, to\nhim, fundamentally an illusion. The effort to reach this vision remains,\nnevertheless, to the Oriental mind the one end and justification of existence,\nthe one escape from the wheel of life, and mankind is for ever divisible into\nthose who see and struggle towards such a goal, and those who are engaged in\nsowing the wind, and reaping the whirlwind, of Desire.\n\nThe battlefield of Kurukshetra lies silent these many centuries, yet still to\nthe ear of the wise man it echoes the doom of Humanity in the terrible words\n"of that which is born, death is certain of that which is dead, birth is\ncertain."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XII.
