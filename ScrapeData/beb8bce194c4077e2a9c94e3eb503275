They declare that the offspring of a _S_ udra and of a female of the\nBrahma _n_ a caste becomes a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala, 1\n\n2\\. (That of a _S_ udra and) of a female of the Kshatriya caste, a Vai _n_ a,\n\n3\\. (That of a _S_ udra and) of a female of the Vai _s_ ya caste, an\nAntyavasayin.\n\n4\\. They declare that the (son) begotten by a Vai _s_ ya on a female of the\nBrahma _n_ a caste becomes a Ramaka, 4\n\n5\\. (The son begotten by the same) on a female of the Kshatriya caste, a\nPulkasa.\n\n6\\. They declare that the (son) begotten by a Kshatriya on a female of the\nBrahma _n_ a caste becomes a Suta. 6\n\n7\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'One may know by their deeds\nthose who have been begotten secretly, and to whom the stigma of springing\nfrom unions in the inverse order of the castes attaches, because they are\ndestitute of virtue and good conduct.' 7\n\np. 95\n\n8\\. (Children) begotten by Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, and Vai _s_ yas on\nfemales of the next lower, second lower, and third lower castes become\n(respectively) Ambash _th_ as, Ugras, and Nishadas. 8\n\n9\\. (The son of a Brahma _n_ a and) of a _S_ udra woman (is) a Para _s_ ava.\n\n10\\. They declare that the condition of a Para _s_ ava is that of one who,\nthough living, is (as impure) as a corpse. 10\n\n11\\. Some call that _S_ udra race a burial-ground. 11\n\n12\\. Therefore (the Veda) must not be recited in the presence of a _S_ udra.\n\n13\\. Now they quote also the (following) verses, which Yama proclaimed:\n\n'The wicked _S_ udra-race is manifestly a burial-ground. Therefore (the Veda)\nmust never be recited in the presence of a _S_ udra.'\n\n14\\. 'Let him not give advice to a _S_ udra, nor what remains from his table,\nnor (remnants of) offerings (to the gods); nor let him explain the holy law to\nsuch a man, nor order him (to perform) a penance.' 14\n\n15\\. 'He who declares the law to such a man, and he who instructs him in (the\nmode of) expiating (sin), sinks together with that very man into the dreadful\nhell, (called) Asa _m_ v _ri_ ta.'\n\n16\\. 'If ever a worm is produced in an open wound (on his body), he shall\npurify himself by the Pra _g_ apatya penance, and give gold, a cow, (and) a\ngarment as presents (to Brahma _n_ as).' 16\n\np. 96\n\n17\\. Let him not approach a wife of the _S_ udra caste after he has built the\nfire-altar for a _S_ rauta-sacrifice.\n\n18\\. For a _S_ udra-wife who belongs to the black race, (is espoused) for\npleasure, not in order to fulfil the law.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[94:1](sbe1421.htm#fr_542) **XVIII**. Vish _n_ u XVI, 6.\n\n[94:4](sbe1421.htm#fr_543) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita reads Romaka, 'a\nRoman,' for Ramaka, and the B. MS. supports him. The other MSS., including I.\nO. 913, give the reading adopted above. I prefer it, as there is no reason to\nassume that the Vasish _th_ a Dharma _s_ astra belongs to the late period when\nthe Hindus had become aware of the existence of the Roman empire. On the other\nhand, it may be urged that Romaka is a correction which would easily suggest\nitself to a Pa _n_ _d_ it, who was unable to find a parallel passage in which\nthe word Ramaka occurs.\n\n[94:6](sbe1421.htm#fr_544) Vish _n_ u XVI, 6.\n\n[94:7](sbe1421.htm#fr_545) Manu X. 40.\n\n[95:8](sbe1421.htm#fr_546) Gautama IV, 16.\n\n[95:10](sbe1421.htm#fr_547) I omit the words _s_ ava iti m _ri_ takhya, 'a\ncorpse is another name for one who has died,' as an interpolation.\n\n[95:11](sbe1421.htm#fr_548) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 9, 9. 12.
