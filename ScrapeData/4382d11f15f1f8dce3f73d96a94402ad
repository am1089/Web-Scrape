Narada said :-- O Lord! I have heard all that you said in brief about the\nPrak _r_ iti Devi. Now describe in detail. Why the Mula Prak _r_ iti \xc3\x82dya\nS\xc2\x92akti (the Prime Force) was created at the beginning before the creation of\nthis world of five elements. How did She, being of the nature of the three Gu\n_n_ as, come to be divided into five parts? I desire to hear all this in\ndetail. Now kindly describe their auspicious births, methods of worship, their\nmeditation, their stotras (praises), Kavachas (the mystic syllables considered\nas a preservation like armour), glory and power in detail.\n\n\n\n5-26. Narayana spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Devar _s_ i! The Mula Prak _r_ iti, of the nature\nof Maya of Para Brahman is an eternal entity (the nabho ma _nd_ al); Time\n(Kala), the ten quarters, the Universe Egg, the Goloka and, lower than this,\nthe Vaiku _nt_ ha Dhama all are eternal things. \xc3\x82tman and Prak _r_ iti are in\ninseparable union with each other as Fire and its burning capacity, the Moon\nand her beauty, the lotus and its splendour, the Sun and his rays are\ninseparably united with each other. As the goldsmith cannot prepare golden\norna-\n\n\n\np. 811\n\n\n\nments without gold and as the potter cannot make earthen pots without earth,\nso the \xc3\x82tman cannot do any work without the help of this omnipotent Prak _r_\niti. The letter \xc2\x93Sa\xc2\x94 indicates \xc2\x93Ais\xc2\x92yaryam\xc2\x94 prosperity, the divine powers; and\n\xc2\x93Kti\xc2\x94, denotes strength; and in as much as She is the bestower of the above\ntwo, the Mula Prak _r_ iti is named \xc2\x93S\xc2\x92akti\xc2\x94. \xc2\x93Bhaga\xc2\x94 is indicative of\nknowledge, prosperity, wealth, fame; and in as much as Mula Prak _r_ iti has\nall these powers, She is also called \xc2\x93Bhagavati\xc2\x94. And \xc3\x82tman \xc2\x93is always in\nunion with this Bhagavati Who is all powers, so He is called \xc2\x93Bhagavan\xc2\x92. The\nBhagavan is therefore sometimes with form; and sometimes He is without form. (\n_Note_ :-- When Prak _r_ iti becomes latent, God is without form; with\nPrakriti manifest, God is with form.) The Yogis always think of the Luminous\nForm of the Formless Bhagavan and declare Him to be all blissful Para Brahma,\nthe God. Though He is invisible, the Witness of all, Omniscient, the Cause of\nall, the Giver of everything and of every form, yet the Vai _sn_ avas do not\nsay so. The Vai _sn_ avas declare how can fire, strength and energy come when\nthere is no fiery, strong, energetic Person behind it? Therefore He who shines\nin the centre of this fiery sphere is the Para Brahma; He is the Fiery Person;\nHe is higher than the Highest. He is All Will; He is All Form, the Cause of\nall causes and His Form is Very Beautiful. He is Young; He looks very peaceful\nand loved by all. He is the Highest; and His Blue Body shines like new rain-\nclouds. His two eyes defy the beauty of the autumn lotuses in the mid-day; His\nexquisitely nice rows of teeth put all the series of pearls in the dark back-\nground. The peacock\xc2\x92s feather is seen on His crown; the garland of Malati\nflowers is suspended from His neck.; His nose is exceedingly beautiful; the\nsweet smile is always seen on His lips. There is no second like Him in showing\nfavour to the Bhaktas. He wears yellow clothings, as if the burning fire is\nemanating all round; the flute is seen on both His hands, reaching His knees.\nHis body is decorated all over with jewels. He is the Sole Refuge of this\nUniverse; the Lord of all, omnipotent and omnipresent. No trace of deficiency\ncan be seen in Him; He is Himself a Siddha (perfect) Puru _s_ a; and the\nforemost of all Siddha Puru _s_ as; bestows Siddhis to all. The Vai _sn_ avas\nmeditate always That Eternal S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Deva of the Devas. He takes\naway fully all the fears of birth, death, old age, and ills and sorrows. The\nage of Brahma is the twinkling of His eye. That Highest Self, the Para Brahma\nis denominated as Kri _sn_ a. The word \xc2\x93Kri _s_ \xc2\x94 denotes Bhakti to S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a and the letter \xc2\x93 _n_ a\xc2\x94 signifies devotion to His service. So He is the\nBestower of Bhakti and devotion to His service. Again \xc2\x93Kri _s_ \xc2\x94 denotes all;\neverything; and\n\n\n\np. 812\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93 _n_ a\xc2\x94 signifies the root. So He Who is the Root and Creator of all, is S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a. When He desired, in the very beginning, to create this Universe,\nthere was nothing then except S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a; and at last, impelled by Kala\n(His Own Creation), He became ready, in His part, to do the work of creation.\n\n\n\n27-61. The Lord, who is All Will, willed and divided Himself into two parts,\nHis Left part becoming female and His Right part becoming male. Then that\nEternal One, Who is greatly loving, looked at the female, His left part, the\nSole Receptacle to hold all the contents of love, very lovely to the eyes, and\nlooking like the beautiful lotus. The loins of this woman defy the Moon; Her\nthighs put the plaintain trees quite in the background; Her breasts are\nmistaken for the beautiful Bel fruits; flowers are scattered as Her Hairs on\nthe head; Her middle part is very slender, very beautiful to behold!\nExceedingly lovely; appearance very calm; sweet smile reigning in Her lips;\nside long glances with Her; Her clothing is purified with fire; all over Her\nbody decorated with gems. Her eyes, also, like the Chakora bird (Greek\npartridge) began to drink incessantly with joy the moon beams from the face of\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, defying, as it were, the ten millions of moons. On Her\nforehead there was the dot of vermillion (red-lead); over that, the dot of\nwhite sandal paste and over that was placed the musk. The fillets or braids of\nhair on Her head are slightly curved; this was decorated with Malati garlands;\non Her neck was suspended the necklace of gems and jewels and She is always\nvery amorous towards Her husband. On looking at Her face, it seems that ten\nmillions of moons have arisen at once; when She walks, Her gait puts\n(humiliates) those of ganders and elephants in the shade. O Muni! S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a, the Lord of the Rasa Dance, and the Person of Taste in the Rasa sport,\nlooked askance at Her for a while and then catching hold of Her by Her hand\nwent to the Rasama _nd_ alam and began to play the Rasa sport (the amorous\npastime). It seemed then the Lord of amorous pastimes had become incarnate\nthere and had been enjoying the various pleasures of amorous passions and\ndesires. So much, that Brahma\xc2\x92s one day passed away in that sport. The Father\nof the Universe, then becoming tired, impregnated in an auspicious moment in\nHer womb who was born of His left portion. The Prak _r_ iti Devi was also\ntired of the embraces of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a; so after the intercourse, she began\nto perspire and breathe frequently. Her perspiration turned into water and\ndeluged the whole universe, with water; and Her breath turned into air and\nbecame the life of all beings. The female that sprung from the left side of\nVayu became his wife and out of their contact originated Pra _n_ a, Apana,\n\n\n\np. 813\n\n\n\nSamana, Udana and Vyana, the five sons. These are the five vital Vayus of all\nthe beings. Besides these from the womb of the Vayu\xc2\x92s wife came out Naga and\nthe other four lower Vayus. The water that came out from perspiration, Vara\n_n_ a Deva became the Presiding Deity of that; and the female, sprung out of\nthe left side of Varu _n_ a Deva, became the wife of Varu _n_ a, called Varu\n_n_ ani. On the other hand, the S\xc2\x92akti, of the nature of knowledge of S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a, remained pregnant for one hundred manvantaras. Her body became\neffulgent with Brahma-teja (the fire of Brahma). Kri _sn_ a was Her life and\nShe again was dearer to Kri _sn_ a than his life even. She remained always\nwith S\xc2\x92ri Krisna; so much so that She constantly rested on His breast. When\none hundred manvantaras passed away, that Beautiful One gave birth to a Golden\nEgg. That egg was the repository of the whole universe. The Beloved of Kri\n_sn_ a became very sorry to see the egg and out of anger, threw that within\nthe water collected in the centre of the Universe. Seeing this, S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_\na raised a great cry and immediately cursed Her duly and said :-- \xc2\x93O Angry\nOne! O Cruel One! When you have forsaken out of anger this son just born of\nyou, I say then that you become from today bereft of any issue. Besides, let\nall those godly women that will spring out of your parts, they also be\ndeprived of having any issue or sons and they will remain ever constant in\ntheir youth. O Muni! While S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a was thus cursing, suddenly came out\nfrom the tongue of the beloved of Kri _sn_ a, a beautiful daughter, of a white\ncolour. Her clothings were all white, in her hands there were lute and book\nand all Her body was decorated with ornaments made of gems and jewels. She was\nthe Presiding Deity of all the S\xc2\x92astras. Some time later the Mula Prak _r_\niti, the Beloved of Kri _sn_ a divided into two parts. Out of Her left portion\ncame Kamala and out of Her right portion came Radhika. In the meantime S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a divided Himself into two parts. From his right side appeared a form\ntwo-handed; and from the left side appeared a form four-handed. Then S\xc2\x92ri\nKrisna addressed the Goddess Speech, holding flute in Her hand, \xc2\x93O Devi! You\nfollow this four-handed Person as his wife\xc2\x94 and then spoke to Radha :-- \xc2\x93O\nRadhe! You are a sensitive, proud lady; let you be My wife; so it will do you\ngood\xc2\x94. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a also told Lak _s_ mi gladly to become the wife of the\nfour-handed Narayana. Then Narayana, the Lord of the world, took both Lak _s_\nmi and Sarasvati to the abode Vaiku _nt_ ha. O Muni! Both Lak _s_ mi and\nSarasvati became issueless, being born of Radha. From the body of Naraya _n_ a\narose his attendants, all four-handed. They were all equal to Him in\nappearance, in qualifications; in spirit and in age. On the other hand, from\nthe body of Kamala arose millions of female attendants all equal to Her in\nform and qualifications. Then\n\n\n\np. 814\n\n\n\narose innumerable Gopas (cow-herds) from the pores of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. They\nwere all equal to the Lord of Goloka in form, Gu _n_ as, power and age; they\nwere all dear to Him as if they were His life.\n\n\n\n62-88. From the pores of Radhika came out the Gopa Kanyas (cow-herdesses).\nThey were all equal to Radha and all were Her attendants and were sweet-\nspeaking. Their bodies were all decorated with ornaments of jewels, and their\nyouth was constant, they were all issueless as S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a had cursed them\nthus. O Best of Brahma _n_ as! On the other hand, suddenly arose Durga, the\nMaya of Vi _sn_ u (The Highest Self) eternal and whose Deity was Kri _sn_ a. (\n_N. B_. Durga was the Avatara of Mula Prak _r_ iti not the Avatara of Radha as\nLak _s_ mi and Sarasvati were.) She is Narayani; She is \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92ani; She is the\nS\xc2\x92akti of all and She is the Presiding Deity of the intelligence of S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a. From Her have come out many other Devis; She is Mula Prak _r_ iti and\nShe is \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92vari; no failings or insufficiencies are seen in Her. She is the\nTejas (of the nature of Fire) and She is of the nature of the three Gu _n_ as.\nHer colour is bright like the molten gold; Her lustre looks as if ten millions\nof Suns have simultaneously arisen. She looks gracious always with sweet smile\non Her lips, Her hands are one thousand in number. Various weapons are in all\nHer hands. The clothings of the three-eyed one are bright and purified by\nFire. She is decorated with ornaments all of jewels. All the women who are the\njewels are sprung from Her parts and parts of parts and by the power of Her\nMaya, all the people of the world are enchanted. She bestows all the wealth\nthat a householder wants; She bestows on Kri _sn_ a\xc2\x92s devotees, the devotion\ntowards Kri _sn_ a; nay, She is the Vai _sn_ avi S\xc2\x92akti of the Vai _sn_ avas.\nShe gives final liberation to those that want such and gives happiness to\nthose that want happiness. She is the Laksmi of the Heavens; as well She is\nthe Laksmi of every household. She is the Tapas of the ascetics, the beauty of\nthe kingdoms of the kings, the burning power of fire, the brilliancy of the\nSun, the tender beauty of the Moon, the lovely beauty of the lotus and the\nS\xc2\x92akti of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a the Highest Self. The Self, the world all are\npowerful by Her S\xc2\x92akti; without Her everything would be a dreary dead mass. O\nNarada! She is the seed of this Tree of World; She is eternal; She is the\nStay, She is Intelligence, fruits, hunger, thirst, mercy, sleep, drowsiness,\nforgiveness, fortitude, peace, bashfulness, nourishment, contentment and\nlustre. The Mula Prak _r_ iti praising S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a stood before Him. The\nLord of Radhika then gave Her a throne to sit. O Great Muni! At this moment\nsprang from the navel lotus the four-faced Brahma, with his wife Savitri, an\nexceedingly beautiful woman. No sooner the four-faced Brahma,\n\n\n\np. 815\n\n\n\nthe foremost of the J\xc3\xb1anins, fond of asceticism and holding Kaman _d_ alu in\nHis hand came into being than He began to praise S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a by His four\nmouths. On the other hand the Devi Savitri, with a beauty of one hundred\nmoons, born with great ease, wearing apparel purified by fire and decorated\nwith various ornaments praised Kri _sn_ a, the One and Only Cause of the\nUniverse and then took Her seat gladly with Her husband in the throne made of\njewels. At that time Kri _sn_ a divided Himself into two parts; His left side\nturned into the forn of Mahadeva; and His right side turned into the Lord of\nGopikas (cow-herdesses). The colour and splendour of the body of Mahadeva is\npure white like white crystal; as if one hundred suns have arisen\nsimultaneously. In His hands there are the trident (Tris\xc2\x92ul) and sharp-edged\nspear (Patti _s_ a); He is wearing a tiger skin; on His head is matted hair\n(Ja _t_ a) of a tawny hue like molten gold; His body was besmeared all over\nwith ashes, smile reigning in His face and on His forehead, the semi-moon. He\nhas no clothing on His loins; so He is called Digambara (the quarters of the\nSky being His clothing); His neck is of a blue colour; the serpent being the\nornaments on His body and on His right hand the nice bead of jewels well\npurified. Who is always repeating with His five faces the Eternal Light of\nBrahma, and Who has conquered Death by praising S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, Who is of the\nnature of Truth, the Highest Self, the God Incarnate, the material cause of\nall things and the All auspicious of all that is good and favourable, and the\nDestroyer of the fear of birth, death, old age, and disease and Who has been\nnamed Mrityunjaya (the conqueror of Death). This Mahadeva took His seat on a\nthrone made of jewels (diamonds, emeralds, etc.).\n\n\n\nHere ends the Second Chapter of the Ninth Book on the origin of Prak _r_ iti\nand Puru _s_ a in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3](bk09ch03.htm)\n\n'
