When he beheld the host of Pandavas,  \nRaja Duryodhana to Drona drew,  \nAnd spake these words: "Ah, Guru! see this line,  \nHow vast it is of Pandu fighting-men,  \nEmbattled by the son of Drupada,  \nThy scholar in the war! Therein stand ranked  \nChiefs like Arjuna, like to Bhima chiefs,  \nBenders of bows; Virata, Yuyudhan,  \nDrupada, eminent upon his car,  \nDhrishtaket, Chekitan, Kasi\'s stout lord,  \nPurujit, Kuntibhoj, and Saivya,  \nWith Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauj  \nSubhadra\'s child; and Drupadi\'s;- all famed!  \nAll mounted on their shining chariots!  \nOn our side, too,- thou best of Brahmans! see  \nExcellent chiefs, commanders of my line,  \nWhose names I joy to count: thyself the first,  \nThen Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight,  \nVikarna, Aswatthaman; next to these  \nStrong Saumadatti, with full many more  \nValiant and tried, ready this day to die  \nFor me their king, each with his weapon grasped,  \nEach skilful in the field. Weakest- meseems-  \nOur battle shows where Bhishma holds command,  \nAnd Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!  \nHave care our captains nigh to Bhishma\'s ranks  \nPrepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!"\n\nThen, at the signal of the aged king,  \nWith blare to wake the blood, rolling around  \nLike to a lion\'s roar, the trumpeter  \nBlew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it,  \nTrumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns  \nBurst into sudden clamour; as the blasts  \nOf loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed!  \nThen might be seen, upon their car of gold  \nYoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,  \nKrishna the God, Arjuna at his side:  \nKrishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch  \nCarved of the "Giant\'s bone;" Arjuna blew  \nIndra\'s loud gift; Bhima the terrible-  \nWolf-bellied Bhima- blew a long reed-conch;  \nAnd Yudhisthira, Kunti\'s blameless son,  \nWinded a mighty shell, "Victory\'s Voice;"  \nAnd Nakula blew shrill upon his conch  \nNamed the "Sweet-sounding," Sahadev on his  \nCalled "Gem-bedecked," and Kasi\'s Prince on his.  \nSikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn,  \nVirata, Satyaki the Unsubdued,  \nDrupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!)  \nLong-armed Subhadra\'s children, all blew loud,  \nSo that the clangour shook their foemen\'s hearts,  \nWith quaking earth and thundering heav\'n.  \nThen \'twas-  \nBeholding Dhritirashtra\'s battle set,  \nWeapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war  \nInstant to break- Arjun, whose ensign-badge  \nWas Hanuman the monkey, spake this thing  \nTo Krishna the Divine, his charioteer:  \n"Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground  \nBetwixt the armies; I would see more nigh  \nThese who will fight with us, those we must slay  \nTo-day, in war\'s arbitrament; for, sure,  \nOn bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain,  \nObeying Dhritirashtra\'s sinful son."\n\nThus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!)  \nBetween the hosts that heavenly Charioteer  \nDrove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds  \nWhere Bhishma led, and Drona, and their Lords.  \n"See!" spake he to Arjuna, "where they stand,  \nThy kindred of the Kurus:" and the Prince  \nMarked on each hand the kinsmen of his house,  \nGrandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons,  \nCousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed  \nWith friends and honoured elders; some this side,  \nSome that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed,  \nSuch kith grown enemies- Arjuna\'s heart  \nMelted with pity, while he uttered this:  \nArjuna. Krishna! as I behold, come here to shed  \nTheir common blood, yon concourse of our kin,  \nMy members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth,  \nA shudder thrills my body, and my hair  \nBristles with horror; from my weak hand slips  \nGandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns  \nMy skin to parching; hardly may I stand;  \nThe life within me seems to swim and faint;  \nNothing do I foresee save woe and wail!  \nIt is not good, O Keshav! nought of good  \nCan spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate  \nTriumph and domination, wealth and ease,  \nThus sadly won! Aho! what victory  \nCan bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils  \nCould profit; what rule recompense; what span  \nOf life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood?  \nSeeing that these stand here, ready to die,  \nFor whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased,  \nAnd power grew precious:- grandsires, sires, and sons,  \nBrothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law,  \nElders and friends! Shall I deal death on these  \nEven though they seek to slay us? Not one blow,  \nO Madhusudan! will I strike to gain  \nThe rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less  \nTo seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these  \nMust breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be  \nGuilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths;  \nTheir sins will light on us, if we shall slay  \nThose sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;  \nWhat peace could come of that, O Madhava?  \nFor if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,  \nThese cannot see, or will not see, the sin  \nOf kingly lines o\'erthrown and kinsmen slain,  \nHow should not we, who see, shun such a crime-  \nWe who perceive the guilt and feel the shame-  \nO thou Delight of Men, Janardana?  \nBy overthrow of houses perisheth  \nTheir sweet continuous household piety,  \nAnd- rites neglected, piety extinct-  \nEnters impiety upon that home;  \nIts women grow unwomaned, whence there spring  \nMad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,  \nSending a Hell-ward road that family,  \nAnd whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.  \nNay, and the souls of honoured ancestors  \nFall from their place of peace, being bereft  \nOf funeral-cakes and the wan death-water.  \nSo teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay  \nKinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,  \nAhovat! what an evil fault it were!  \nBetter I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,  \nTo face them weaponless, and bare my breast  \nTo shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.\n\nSo speaking, in the face of those two hosts,  \nArjuna sank upon his chariot-seat,  \nAnd let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER I OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Arjun-Vishad,"  \nOr "The Book of the Distress of Arjuna."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2: Of Doctrines](bg02.htm)\n\n'
