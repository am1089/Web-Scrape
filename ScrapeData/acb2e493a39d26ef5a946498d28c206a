Charm to arouse the passionate love of a woman.\n\n1\\. Clinging to the ground thou didst grow, (O plant), that producest bliss\nfor me; a hundred branches extend from thee, three and thirty grow down from\nthee: with this plant of a thousand leaves thy heart do I parch.  \n2\\. Thy heart shall parch (with love) for me, and thy mouth shall parch (with\nlove for me)! Languish, moreover, with love for me, with parched mouth pass\nthy days!  \n3\\. Thou that causest affection, kindlest (love), brown, lovely (plant), draw\n(us) together; draw together yonder woman and myself, our hearts make the\nsame!  \n4\\. As the mouth of him that hath not drunk dries tip, thus languish thou with\nlove for me, with parched mouth pass thy days!  \n5\\. As the Ichneumon tears the serpent, and joins him together again, thus, O\npotent (plant), join together what hath been torn by love!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 38.
