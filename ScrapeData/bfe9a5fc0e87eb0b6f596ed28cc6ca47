Now next the Upanishad of the whole speech.\n\nTrue all these are Upanishads of the whole speech, but this they call so\n(chiefly).\n\n2\\. The mute consonants represent the earth, the sibilants the sky, the vowels\nheaven.\n\nThe mute consonants represent Agni (fire), the sibilants air, the vowels the\nsun.\n\nThe mute consonants represent the _Ri_ g-veda, the sibilants the Ya _g_ ur-\nveda, the vowels the Sama-veda.\n\nThe mute consonants represent the eye, the sibilants the ear, the vowels the\nmind.\n\nThe mute consonants represent the up-breathing, the sibilants the down-\nbreathing, the vowels the back-breathing.\n\n3\\. Next comes this divine lute (the human body, made by the gods). The lute\nmade by man is an imitation of it.\n\n4\\. As there is a head of this, so there is a head of that (lute, made by\nman). As there is a stomach\n\np. 264\n\nof this, so there is the cavity 1 (In the board) of that. As there is a tongue\nof this, so there is a tongue 2 in that. As there are fingers of this, so\nthere are strings of that 3. As there are vowels of this, so there are tones\nof that. As there are consonants of this, so there are touches of that. As\nthis is endowed with sound and firmly strung, so that is endowed with sound\nand firmly strung. As this is covered with a hairy skin, so that is covered\nwith a hairy skin.\n\n5\\. Verily, in former times they covered a lute with a hairy skin.\n\n6\\. He who knows this lute made by the Devas (and meditates on it), is\nwillingly listened to, his glory fills the earth, and wherever they speak\n\xc3\x82ryan languages, there they know him.\n\n7\\. Next follows the verse, called vagrasa, the essence of speech. When a man\nreciting or speaking in an assembly does not please, let him say this verse:\n\n8\\. 'May the queen of all speech, who is covered, as it were, by the lips,\nsurrounded by teeth, as if by spears, who is a thunderbolt, help me to speak\nwell.' This is the vagrasa, the essence of speech.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[263:2](sbe01237.htm#fr_677) After having inserted the preceding chapter on\nomina and the concluding paragraph on the highest knowledge, he now returns to\nthe meditation on the letters.\n\n[264:1](sbe01237.htm#fr_678) The Kashmir MS. reads udara evam, &c.\n\n[264:2](sbe01237.htm#fr_679) Vadanam, what makes the instrument speak,\nhastena.
