And first be it told of the wooing of Shakuntala\nand the strange childhood of her mighty son.\n\nOne day King Dushyanta, that tiger among men, went forth from his stately\npalace to go a-hunting with a great host and many horses and elephants. He\nentered a deep jungle and there slew numerous wild animals; his arrows wounded\ntigers at a distance; he felled those that came near with his great sword.\nLions fled from before him, wild elephants stampeded in terror, deer sought to\nescape hastily, and birds rose in the air uttering cries of distress.\n\nThe king, attended by a single follower, pursued a deer across a desert plain,\nand entered a beautiful forest\n\np. 158\n\nwhich delighted his heart, for it was deep and shady, and was cooled by soft\nwinds; sweet-throated birds sang in the branches, and all round about there\nwere blossoming trees and blushing flowers; he heard the soft notes of the\nkokila 1, and beheld many a green bower carpeted with grass and canopied by\nmany-coloured creepers.\n\nDushyanta, abandoning the chase, wandered on until he came to a delightful and\nsecluded hermitage, where he saw the sacred fire of that austere and high-\nsouled Brahman, the saintly Kanva. It was a scene of peace and beauty.\nBlossoms from the trees covered the ground; tall were the trunks, and the\nbranches were far-sweeping. A silvery stream went past, breaking on the banks\nin milk-white foam; it was the sacred River Malini, studded with green\nislands, loved by water fowl, and abounding with fish.\n\nThen the king was taken with desire to visit the holy sage, Kanva, he who is\nwithout darkness. So he divested himself of his royal insignia and entered the\nsacred grove alone. Bees were humming; birds trilled their many melodies; he\nheard the low chanting voices of Brahmans among the trees--those holy men who\ncan take captive all human hearts. . . .\n\nWhen he reached the abode of Kanva, he wondered to find that it was empty, and\ncalled out: "Who is here?" and the forest echoed his voice.\n\nThen came towards him a beautiful black-eyed virgin, clad in a robe of bark.\nShe reverenced the king and said: "What seekest thou? I am thy servant."\n\nSaid the royal Dushyanta to the maiden of faultless form and gentle voice: "I\nhave come to honour the wise and blessed Kanva. Tell me, O fair and amiable\none, whither he hath gone?"\n\np. 159\n\nThe maiden answered: "My illustrious sire is gathering herbs, but if thou wilt\ntarry he will return ere long."\n\nDushyanta was entranced by the beauty and sweet smiles of the gentle girl, and\nhis heart was moved towards her, for she was in the bloom of youth. So he\nspake, saying: "Who art thou, O fairest one? Whence comest thou, and why dost\nthou wander alone in the woods? O comely maiden, thou hast taken captive my\nheart."\n\nThe bright-eyed one made answer: "I am the daughter of the holy and high-\nsouled Kanva, the ever-wise and ever-constant."\n\nSaid the king: "But Kanva is chaste and austere and hath ever been a celibate,\nnor can he have broken his rigid vow. How came it that thou wert born the\ndaughter of such a one?"\n\nThen the maiden, who was named Shakuntala, because that the birds (shakunta)\nhad nursed her, revealed unto the king the secret of her birth. Her real sire\nwas Vishwamitra 1, the holy sage who had been a Kshatriya and was made a\nBrahman in reward for his austerities. It came to pass that Indra became\nalarmed at his growing power, and he feared that the mighty sage of blazing\nenergy would, by reason of his penances, cast down even him, the king of the\ngods, from his heavenly seat. So Indra commanded Menaka, the beauteous\nAp\'sara, to disturb the holy meditations of the sage, for he had already\nachieved such power that he created a second world and many stars. The nymph\ncalled on the wind god and on the god of love, and they went with her towards\nVishwamitra.\n\nMenaka danced before the brooding sage; then the\n\np. 160\n\nwind god snatched away her moon-white garments, and the love god shot his\narrows at Vishwamitra, whereupon that saintly man was stricken with love for\nthe nymph of peerless beauty, and he wooed her and won her as his bride. So\nwas he diverted from his austerities. In time Menaka became the mother of a\ngirl babe, whom she cast away on the river bank.\n\nNow the forest was full of lions and tigers, but vultures gathered round the\ninfant and protected her from harm. Then Kanva found and took pity on the\nchild; he said: "She will be mine own daughter."\n\nSaid Shakuntala: "O king, I was that child who was abandoned by the nymph, and\nnow thou dost know how Kanva came to be my sire."\n\nThe king said: "Blessed are thy words, O princess. Thou art of royal birth. Be\nthou my bride, O beautiful maid, and thou wilt have garlands of gold and\ngolden ear-rings and white pearls and rich robes; my kingdom also will be\nthine, O timid one; wed thou me in Gandharva mode, which of all marriages is\nthe best." 1\n\nThen Shakuntala promised to be the king\'s bride, on condition that he would\nchoose her son as the heir to his throne.\n\n"As thou desirest, so let it be," said Dushyanta. And the fair one became his\nbride.\n\nEre Dushyanta went away he promised Shakuntala that he would send a mighty\nhost to escort her to his palace.\n\nWhen Kanva returned, the maiden did not leave her hiding-place to greet him;\nbut he searched out and found her, and he read her heart. "Thou hast not\nbroken the law," he said. "Dushyanta, thine husband, is noble and\n\np. 161\n\ntrue, and a son will be born unto thee who will achieve great renown."\n\nIn time fair Shakuntala became the mother of a comely boy, and the wheel mark\n1 was on his hands. He grew to be strong and brave, and when but six years old\nhe sported with young lions, for he was suckled by a lioness; he rode on the\nbacks of lions and tigers and wild boars in the midst of the forest. He was\ncalled All-tamer, because that he tamed everything.\n\nNow when Kanva perceived that the boy was of unequalled prowess, he spake to\nShakuntala and said: "The time hath come when he must be anointed as heir to\nthe throne." So he bade his disciples to escort mother and son unto the city\nof Gajasahvaya 2, where Dushyanta had his royal palace.\n\nSo it came that Shakuntala once again stood before the king, and she said unto\nhim: "Lo! I have brought unto thee this thy son, O Dushyanta. Fulfil the\npromise thou didst make aforetime, and let him be anointed as thine heir."\n\nDushyanta had no pleasure in her words, and made answer: "I have no memory of\nthee. Who are thou and whence cometh thou, O wicked hermit woman? I never took\nthee for wife, nor care I whether thou art to linger here or to depart\nspeedily."\n\nStunned by his cold answer, the sorrowing Shakuntala stood there like a log. .\n. . Soon her eyes became red as copper and her lips trembled; she cast burning\nglances at the monarch. For a time she was silent; then she exclaimed with\nfervour: "O king without shame, well dost thou know who I am. Why wilt thou\ndeny knowledge of me as if thou wert but an inferior person? Thy heart is a\nwitness against thee. Be not a robber of thine\n\np. 162\n\nown affections. . . . The gods behold everything: naught is hidden from them;\nverily, they will not bless one who doth degrade himself by speaking falsely\nregarding himself. Spurn not the mother of thy son; spurn not thy faithful\nwife. A true wife beareth a son; she is the first of friends and the source of\nsalvation; she enables her husband to perform religious acts, her sweet\nspeeches bring him joy; she is a solace and a comforter in sickness and in\nsorrow; she is a companion in this world and the next. If a husband dies, a\nwife follows soon afterwards; if she is gone before, she waiteth for her\nhusband in heaven. She is the mother of the son who performs the funeral rite\nto secure everlasting bliss for his sire, rescuing him from the hell called\nPut. Therefore a man should reverence the mother of his son, and look upon his\nson as if he beheld his own self in a mirror, rejoicing the while as if he had\nfound heaven. . . . Why, O king, dost thou spurn thine own child? Even the\nants will protect their eggs; strangers far from home take the children of\nothers on their knees to be made happy, but thou hast no compassion for this\nchild, although he is thy son, thine own image. . . . Alas! what sin did I\ncommit in my former state that I should have been deserted by my parents and\nnow by thee! . . . If I must go hence, take thou thy son to thy bosom, O\nking."\n\nSaid Dushyanta: "It has been well said that all women are liars. Who will\nbelieve thee? I know naught regarding thee or thy son. . . . Begone! O wicked\nwoman, for thou art without shame."\n\nShakuntala made answer, speaking boldly and without fear: "O king, thou canst\nperceive the shortcomings of others, although they may be as small as mustard\nseeds; thou art blind to thine own sins, although they may be big as Vilwa\nfruit. As the swine loveth dirt even in a\n\np. 163\n\nflower garden, so do the wicked perceive evil in all that the good relate.\nHonest men refrain from speaking ill of others: the wicked rejoice in scandal.\nO king! truth is the chief of all virtues. Truth is God himself. Do not break\nthy vow of truth: let truth be ever a part of thee. But if thou wouldst rather\nbe false, I must needs depart, for, verily, such a one as thee should be\navoided. . . . Yet know now, O Dushyanta, that when thou art gone, my son will\nbe king of this world, which is surrounded by the four seas and adorned by the\nmonarch of mountains."\n\nShakuntala then turned from the king, but a voice out of heaven spoke softly\ndown the wind, saying:\n\n" _Shakuntala hath uttered what is true. Therefore, O Dushyanta, cherish thy\nson, and because thou wilt cherish him by command of the gods, let his name be\nBharata_ (\' _the cherished_ \')."\n\nWhen the king heard these words, he spoke to his counsellors and said: "The\ncelestial messenger hath spoken. . . . Had I welcomed this my son by pledge of\nShakuntala alone, men would suspect the truth of her words and doubt his royal\nbirth."\n\nThereafter Dushyanta embraced his son and kissed him, and he honoured\nShakuntala as his chief rani 1; he said to her, soothingly: "From all men have\nI concealed our union; and for the sake of thine own good name I hesitated to\nacknowledge thee. Forgive my harsh words, as I forgive thine. Thou didst speak\npassionately because thou lovest me well, O great-eyed and fair one, whom I\nlove also."\n\nThe son of Shakuntala was then anointed as heir to the throne, and he was\nnamed Bharata. 2\n\np. 164\n\nWhen Dushyanta died, Bharata became king. Great was his fame, as befitted a\ndescendant of Chandra. 1 He was a mighty warrior, and none could withstand him\nin battle; he made great conquests, and extended his kingdom all over\nHindustan, which was called Bharatavarsha. 2\n\nKing Bharata was the sire of King Hastin, who built the great city of\nHastinapur; King Hastin begot King Kuru, and King Kuru begot King Shantanu.\n\nBe it told of the King Shantanu that he was pious and just and all-powerful,\nas was meet for the great grandson of King Bharata. His first wife was the\ngoddess Ganga of the Ganges river, and she was divinely beautiful like to her\nkind. Ere she assumed human form for a time, there came to her the eight\nVasus, the attendants of Indra. It chanced that when the Brahman Vasishtha was\nengaged in his holy meditations the Vasus flew between him and the sun,\nwhereupon the angered sage cursed them, saying: "Be born among men!" Nor could\nthey escape this fate, so great was the Rishi\'s power over celestial beings.\nSo they hastened to Ganga, and she consented to become their human mother,\npromising that she would cast them one by one into the Ganges soon after\nbirth, so that they might return speedily to their celestial state. For this\nservice Ganga made each of the Vasus promise to confer an eighth part of his\npower on her son, who, according to her desire, should remain among men for\nmany years, but would never marry or have offspring.\n\n\n\n[![SHANTANU MEETS THE GODDESS GANGA<br> <i>From the painting by Warwick\nGoble</i>.](tn/16400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/16400.jpg)  \nSHANTANU MEETS THE GODDESS GANGA  \n_From the painting by Warwick Goble_.  \n\n\n\np. 165\n\nA day came thereafter when King Shantanu walked beside the Ganges. Suddenly\nthere appeared before him a maiden of surpassing beauty. She was Ganga in\nhuman form. Her celestial garments had the splendour of lotus blooms; she was\nadorned with rare ornaments, and her teeth were radiant as pearls. The king\nwas silenced by her charms, and gazed upon her steadfastly . . . In time he\nperceived that the maiden regarded him with love-lorn eyes, as if she sought\nto look upon him for ever, and he spoke to her, saying: "O slender-waisted and\nfair one, art thou one of the Danavas, or art thou of the race of Gandharvas,\nor art thou of the Apsaras; art thou one of the Yakshas or Nagas, 1 or art\nthou of human kind, O peerless and faultless one? Be thou my bride."\n\nThe goddess made answer that she would wed the king, but said she must needs\nat once depart from him if he spoke harshly to her at any time, or attempted\nto thwart her in doing as she willed. Shantanu consented to her terms, and\nGanga became his bride.\n\nIn time the goddess gave birth to a son, but soon afterwards she cast him into\nthe Ganges, saying: "This for thy welfare."\n\nThe king was stricken with horror, but he spake not a word to his beautiful\nbride lest she should leave him.\n\nSo were seven babes, one after another, destroyed by their mother in like\nmanner. When the eighth was born, the goddess sought to drown him also; but\nthe king\'s pent-up wrath broke forth in a torrent of speech, and he upbraided\nhis heartless wife. Thus was his marriage vow broken, and Ganga given power to\ndepart unto her own place. But ere she went she revealed unto the king who she\nwas, and also why she had cast the Vasus, her children, into the Ganges. Then\nshe\n\np. 166\n\nsuddenly vanished from before his eyes, taking the last babe with her.\n\nEre long the fair goddess returned to Shantanu for a brief space, and she\nbrought with her for the king a fair and noble son, who was endowed with the\nvirtues of the Vasus. Then she departed never to come again. The heart of\nShantanu was moved towards the child, who became a comely and powerful youth,\nand was named Satanava. 1\n\nWhen Shantanu had grown old, he sought to marry a young and beautiful bride\nwhom he loved. For one day as he walked beside the Jumna river he was\nattracted by a sweet and alluring perfume, which drew him through the trees\nuntil he beheld a maiden of celestial beauty with luminous black eyes. 2 The\nking spake to her and said: "Who art thou, and whose daughter, O timid one?\nWhat doest thou here?"\n\nSaid the maiden, blessing Shantanu: "I am the daughter of a fisherman, and I\nferry passengers across the river in my boat."\n\nNow, the name of this fair maiden was Satyavati. 3 Like Shakuntala, she was of\nmiraculous origin, and had been adopted by her reputed sire. It chanced that a\nfish once carried away in its stomach two unborn babes, a girl and a boy,\nwhose father was a great rajah. This fish was caught by a fisherman, who\nopened it and found the children. He sent the manchild unto the rajah and kept\nthe girl, who was reared as his own daughter. She grew to be comely and fair,\nbut a fishy odour ever clung to her.\n\np. 167\n\nOne day, as she ferried pilgrims across the Jumna, there entered her boat\nalone the high and pious Brahman Parashara, who was moved by the maiden\'s\ngreat beauty. He desired that she should become the mother of his son, and\npromised that ever afterwards an alluring perfume would emanate from her body.\nHe then caused a cloud to fall upon the boat, and it vanished from sight.\n\nWhen the fisher girl became the mother of a son, he grew suddenly before her\neyes, and in a brief space was a man. His name was Vyasa 1; he bade his mother\nfarewell, and hastened to the depths of a forest to spend his days in holy\nmeditation. Ere he departed he said unto Satyavati: "If ever thou hast need of\nme, think of me, and I shall come to thine aid."\n\nWhen this wonder had been accomplished, Satyavati became a virgin again\nthrough the power of the great sage Parashara, and a delicious odour lingered\nabout her ever afterwards.\n\nOn this maiden King Shantanu gazed with love. Then he sought the fisherman,\nand said he desired the maiden to be his bride. But the man refused to give\nhis daughter to the king in marriage until he promised that her son should be\nchosen as heir to the throne. Shantanu could not consent to disinherit\nSatanava, son of Ganga, and went away with a heavy heart.\n\nGreatly the king sorrowed in his heart because of his love for the dark-eyed\nmaiden, and at length Satanava was given his secret. Then that noble son of\nGanga went to search for the beautiful daughter of the fisher-man, and he\nfound her. The fisherman said unto him, when he had made known his mission:\n"If Satyavati bears sons, they will not inherit the kingdom, for the king hath\nalready a son, and he will succeed him."\n\np. 168\n\nSatanava thereupon made a vow renouncing his claim to the throne, and said:\n"If thou wilt give thy daughter unto my sire to be his queen, I, who am his\nheir, will never accept the throne, nor marry a wife, or be the father of\nchildren. If, then, Satyavati will become the mother of a son, he will surely\nbe chosen rajah." When he had spoken thus, the gods and Apsaras, the mist\nfairies, caused flowers to fall out of heaven upon the prince\'s head, and a\nvoice came down the wind, saying: " _This one is Bhishma_."\n\nSo from that day the son of Ganga was called Bhishma, which signifies the\n"Terrible", for the vow that he had taken was terrible indeed.\n\nThen was Satyavati given in marriage to the king, and she bore him two sons,\nwho were named Chitrangada and Vichitra-virya. 1\n\nIn time Santanu sank under the burden of his years, and his soul departed from\nhis body. Unto Bhishma was left the care of the queen-mother, Satyavati, and\nthe two princes.\n\nWhen the days of mourning went past, Bhishma renounced the throne in\naccordance with his vow, and Chitrangada was proclaimed king. This youth was a\nhaughty ruler, and his reign was brief. He waged war against the Gandhari of\nthe hills 2 for three years, and was slain in battle by their rajah. Then\nBhishma placed Vichitra-virya on the throne, and, as he was but a boy, Bhishma\nruled as regent for some years.\n\nAt length the time came for the young king to marry, and Bhishma set out to\nfind wives for him. It chanced\n\np. 169\n\nthat the King of Kasi (Benares) had three fair daughters whose swayamvara 1\nwas being proclaimed. When Bhishma was told of this he at once entered his\nchariot and drove from Hastinapur 2 to Kasi to discover if the girls were\nworthy of the monarch of Bharatavarsha. He found that they had great beauty,\nand he was well pleased thereat. The great city was thronged with rajahs who\nhad gathered from far and near to woo the maidens, but Bhishma would not tarry\nuntil the day of the swayamvara. He immediately seized the king\'s fair\ndaughters and placed them in his chariot. Then he challenged the assembled\nrajahs and sons of rajahs in a voice like thunder, saying:\n\n"The sages have decreed that a king may give his daughter with many gifts unto\none he has invited when she hath chosen him. Others may barter their daughters\nfor two kine, and some may give them in exchange for gold. But maidens may\nalso be taken captive. They may be married by consent, or forced to consent,\nor be obtained by sanction of their sires. Some are given wives as reward for\nperforming sacrifices, a form approved by the sages. Kings ever favour the\nswayamvara, and obtain wives according to its rules. But learned men have\ndeclared that the wife who is to be most highly esteemed is she who is taken\ncaptive after battle with the royal guests who attend a swayamvara. Hear and\nknow, then, ye mighty rajahs, I will carry off these fair daughters of the\nking of Kasi, and I challenge all who are here to overcome me or else be\novercome themselves by me in battle."\n\nThe royal guests who were there accepted the challenge,\n\np. 170\n\nand Bhishma fought against them with great fury. Bows were bent and ten\nthousand arrows were discharged against him, but he broke their flight with\ninnumerable darts from his own mighty bow. Strong and brave was he indeed;\nthere was none who could overcome him; he fought and conquered all, until not\na rajah was left to contend against him. 1\n\nThus did Bhishma, the terrible son of the ocean-going Ganga, take captive\nafter battle the three fair daughters of the King of Kasi; and he drove away\nwith them in his chariot towards Hastinapur. 2\n\nWhen he reached the royal palace he presented the maidens unto Queen\nSatyavati, who was well pleased, and at once gave many costly gifts to\nBhishma. She decided that the captives should become the wives of her son,\nKing Vichitra-virya.\n\nEre the wedding ceremony was held, the eldest maiden, whose name was Amba,\npleaded with the queen to be set free, saying:\n\n"I have been betrothed already by my sire unto the Rajah of Sanva. Oh, send me\nunto him now, for I cannot marry a second time."\n\nHer prayer was granted, and Bhishma sent her with an escort unto the Rajah of\nSanva. Then the fair Amba related unto him how she had been taken captive; but\nthe rajah exclaimed, with anger: "Thou hast already dwelt in the house of a\nstrange man, and I cannot take thee for my wife."\n\nThe maiden wept bitterly, and she knelt before the monarch and said: "No man\nhath wronged me, O\n\np. 171\n\nmighty rajah. Bhishma hath taken a terrible vow of celibacy which he cannot\nbreak. If thou wilt not have me for wife, I pray thee to take me as thy\nconcubine, so that I may dwell safely in thy palace."\n\nBut the rajah spurned the beautiful maiden, and his servants drove her from\nthe palace and out of the city. So was she compelled to seek refuge in the\nlonely forest, and there she practised great austerities with purpose to\nsecure power to slay Bhishma, who had wronged her. In the end she threw\nherself upon a pyre, so that she might attain her desire in the next life. 1\n\nHer two sisters, Amvika and Amvalika, became the wives of Vitchitra-virya, who\nloved them well; but his days were brief, and he wasted away with sickness\nuntil at length he died. No children were born to the king, and his two widows\nmourned for him.\n\nThe heart of Queen Satyavati was stricken with grief because that her two sons\nwere dead, and there was left no heir to the throne of King Bharata.\n\nNow it was the custom in those days that a kinsman should become the father of\nchildren to succeed the dead king. 2 So Queen Satyavati spake unto Bhishma,\nsaying: "Take thou the widows of my son and raise up sons who will be as sons\nof the king."\n\nBut Bhishma said: "That I cannot do, for have I not vowed never to be the sire\nof any children."\n\nIn her despair Satyavati then thought of her son Vyasa, and he immediately\nappeared before her and consented to do as was her desire. 3\n\nNow Vyasa was a mighty sage, but, by reason of his\n\np. 172\n\nausterities in his lonely jungle dwelling, he had grown gaunt and repulsive of\naspect so that women shrank from before him; fearsome was he, indeed, to look\nupon.\n\nAmvika closed her eyes with horror when she beheld the sage, and she had a son\nwho was born blind: he was named Dhritarashtra. Amvalika turned pale with\nfear: she had a son who was named Pandu, "the pale one".\n\nSatyavati desired that Vyasa should be the father of a son who had no defect;\nbut Amvika sent her handmaiden unto him, and she bore a son who was called\nVidura. As it happened, Dharma, god of justice, was put under the spell of a\nRishi at this time, to be born among men, and he chose Vidura to be his human\nincarnation.\n\nThe three children were reared by Bhishma, who was regent over the kingdom,\nand was yet subject to Queen Satyavati. He taught them the laws and trained\nthem as warriors. When the time came to select a king, Dhritarashtra 1 was\npassed over because that he was blind, and Vidura because of his humble birth,\nand Pandu, "the pale one", was set upon the throne.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[157:1](iml14.htm#fr_189) _Pron_. bah\xc2\xb4ra-ta or bhah\xc2\xb4ra-ta.\n\n[158:1](iml14.htm#fr_190) The Indian cuckoo.\n\n[159:1](iml14.htm#fr_191) _Pron_. vish-wah-mit\xc2\xb4ra.\n\n[160:1](iml14.htm#fr_192) The Gandharva marriage was legalized by Manu, but\nonly for members of the Kshatriya (kings and warriors) caste.\n\n[161:1](iml14.htm#fr_193) A sign of martial and royal origin.\n\n[161:2](iml14.htm#fr_194) _Pron_.
