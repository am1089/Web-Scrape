And (scripture) declares (Brahman) to consist of that (i.e.\nintelligence).\n\nAnd scripture declares that Brahman consists of intelligence, is devoid of any\nother characteristics, and is altogether without difference; 'As a mass of\nsalt has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of taste, thus,\nindeed, has that Self neither inside nor outside, but is altogether\n\np. 157\n\na mass of knowledge' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 13). That means: That Self has\nneither inside nor outside any characteristic form but intelligence; simple\nnon-differentiated intelligence constitutes its nature; just as a lump of salt\nhas inside as well as outside one and the same saltish taste, not any other\ntaste.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 17](sbe38120.htm)\n\n"
