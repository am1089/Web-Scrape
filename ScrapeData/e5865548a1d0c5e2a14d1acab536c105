Now, at the beginning, Pra _g_ apati was (composed of) both these,\nthe mortal and the immortal--his vital airs alone were immortal, his body\nmortal: by this sacrificial performance, and by this order of proceeding, he\nmade his body uniformly undecaying and immortal. And in like manner is the\nSacrificer (composed of) both the mortal and the immortal--his vital airs\nalone are immortal, his body mortal: by this sacrificial performance, and by\nthis order of proceeding, he makes his body uniformly undecaying and immortal.\n\n10:1:4:22\\. He lays down the first layer,--this, doubtless, is his out- (and\nin-) breathing 1, and it is an immortal (element), for the out-breathing is\nsomething immortal: this, then, is an immortal layer. He then scatters loose\nsoil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his marrow, and it is a mortal (element),\nfor the marrow is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and\nthereby this part of him becomes immortal.\n\n10:1:4:33\\. He lays down the second layer,--this, doubtless, is his downward\nbreathing, and it is an immortal (element), for the downward breathing is\nsomething immortal: this, then, is an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that\nmortal (element) on both\n\np. 293\n\nsides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He\nthen scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his bones, and it is a\nmortal (element), for the bone is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal\n(element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.\n\n10:1:4:44\\. He lays down the third layer,--this, doubtless, is his through-\nbreathing 1, and it is an immortal (element), for the through-breathing is\nsomething immortal: this, then, is an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that\nmortal (element) on both sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of\nhim becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless,\nis his sinews, and it is a mortal (element), for the sinew is mortal: he\nestablishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him\nbecomes immortal.\n\n10:1:4:55\\. He lays down the fourth layer,--this, doubtless, is his upward\nbreathing 2, and it is an immortal (element), for the upward breathing is\nsomething immortal: this, then, is an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that\nmortal (element) on both sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of\nhim becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless,\nis his flesh, and it is a mortal (element), for flesh is mortal: he\nestablishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him\nbecomes immortal.\n\n10:1:4:66\\. He lays down the fifth layer,--this, doubtless,\n\np. 294\n\nis his central (or pervading) breathing 1, and it is an immortal (element),\nfor the central breathing is something immortal: this, then, is an immortal\nlayer. He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both sides by an immortal\none, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then scatters loose\nsoil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his fat, and it is a mortal (element), for\nthe fat is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby\nthis part of him becomes immortal.\n\n10:1:4:77\\. He lays down the sixth layer,--this, doubtless, is his voice, and\nit is an immortal (element), for the voice is something immortal: this, then,\nis an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both sides\nby an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then\nscatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his blood and his skin, and\nit is a mortal (element), for blood is mortal, and skin is mortal: he\nestablishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him\nbecomes immortal.\n\n10:1:4:88\\. These, then, are six layers of bricks, and six layers of earth,\nthat makes twelve,--the year (consists of) twelve months, and Agni is the\nyear: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much did Pra\n_g_ apati then make his body uniformly undecaying and immortal; and in like\nmanner does the Sacrificer now make his body uniformly undecaying and\nimmortal.\n\n10:1:4:99\\. Having then laid down the Vikar _n_ i and Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a,\nhe scatters chips of gold, and places\n\np. 295\n\nthe fire thereon: Pra _g_ apati then finally made a golden form for his body;\nand inasmuch as (he did so) finally, this was the final form of his body;\nwhence people speak of 'the golden Pra _g_ apati 1.' And in like manner does\nthe Sacrificer now finally make a golden form for his body; and inasmuch as\n(he does so) finally, this is the final form of his body; and hence, whether\nthey know this or not, people say that the Agni _k_ it (he who has built an\naltar) is born in yonder world as one made of gold 2.\n\n10:1:4:1010\\. Now, on this point, _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya and Saptarathavahani,\nteacher and pupil, were once disputing with one another: 'This is his form,'\nsaid _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya; 'his hair,' said Saptarathavahani.\n\n10:1:4:1111\\. _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya said, 'Surely, there is a hairy form (as well\nas) a hairless form: his form it certainly is;' and this, indeed, is as _S_ a\n_n_ _d_ ilya has said: when it (the altar) is completely built, Agni is led\nforward; and after he has been led forward, logs of wood 3 are offered as\n'oblations.'\n\n10:1:4:1212\\. By means of (the channel of) the out- (and in-) breathing the\ngods eat food, and Agni (the sacrificial fire) is the out-breathing of the\ngods; whence it is in front (of the sacrificial ground) that offering is made\nto the gods, for by means of the (channel of the) out-breathing the gods eat\nfood. By means of the down-breathing men eat food, whence food\n\np. 296\n\nis introduced into men (from the front) towards the back, for by their down-\nbreathing men eat food.\n\n10:1:4:1313\\. Here, now, they say, 'He who has built an altar must not eat of\nany bird, for he who builds a fire-altar becomes of a bird's form; he would be\napt to incur sickness: the Agni _k_ it therefore must not eat of any bird.'\nNevertheless, one who knows this may safely eat thereof; for he who builds an\naltar becomes of Agni's form, and, indeed, all food here belongs to Agni:\nwhosoever knows this will know that all food belongs to him.\n\n10:1:4:1414\\. Here, now, they say, 'What is done here in (the building of) the\naltar, whereby the Sacrificer conquers recurring death?' Well, he who builds\nan altar becomes the deity Agni; and Agni (the fire), indeed, is the immortal\n(element);--the gods are splendour: he enters splendour; the gods are glory:\nhe becomes glorious whosoever knows this.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[292:1](sbe4348.htm#fr_547) That is, the breath-proper, of the mouth and nose,\npassing upward into the air from the middle of the body.\n\n[293:1](sbe4348.htm#fr_548) The Vyana, through-breathing, or circulating air,\nis the vital air which serves the upward air (or out- and in-breathing, pra\n_n_ a) and downward air (apana).
