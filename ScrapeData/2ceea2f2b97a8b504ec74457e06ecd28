'Reflection (dhyana) 1 is better than consideration. The earth reflects,\nas it were, and thus does the sky, the heaven, the water, the mountains, gods\nand men. Therefore those who among men obtain\n\np. 115\n\ngreatness here on earth, seem to have obtained a part of the object of\nreflection (because they show a certain repose of manner). Thus while small\nand vulgar people are always quarrelling, abusive, and slandering, great men\nseem to have obtained a part of the reward of reflection. Meditate on\nreflection.\n\n2\\. 'He who meditates on reflection as Brahman, is lord and master, as it\nwere, as far as reflection reaches--he who meditates on reflection as\nBrahman.'\n\n'Sir, is there something better than reflection?'\n\n'Yes, there is something better than reflection.'\n\n'Sir, tell it me.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[114:1](sbe01140.htm#fr_309) Reflection is concentration of all our thoughts\non one object, ekagrata. And as a man who reflects and meditates on the\nhighest objects acquires thereby repose, becomes firm and immovable, so the\nearth is supposed to be in repose and immovable, as it were, by reflection and\nmeditation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 7](sbe01141.htm)\n\n"
