Verily, whoever exists, he, in being born, is born as (owing) a\ndebt to the gods, to the _Ri_ shis, to the fathers, and to men 1.\n\n1:7:2:22\\. For, inasmuch as he is bound to sacrifice, for that reason he is\nborn as (owing) a debt to the gods: hence when he sacrifices to them, when he\nmakes\n\np. 191\n\nofferings to them, he does this (in discharge of his debt) to them.\n\n1:7:2:33\\. And further, inasmuch as he is bound to study (the Veda), for that\nreason he is born as (owing) a debt to the _Ri_ shis: hence it is to them that\nhe does this; for one who has studied (the Veda) they call 'the _Ri_ shis'\ntreasure-warden.'\n\n1:7:2:44\\. And further, inasmuch as he is bound to wish for offspring, for\nthat reason he is born as (owing) a debt to the fathers: hence when there is\n(provided by him) a continued, uninterrupted lineage, it is for them that he\ndoes this.\n\n1:7:2:55\\. And further, inasmuch as he is bound to practise hospitality, for\nthat reason he is born as (owing) a debt to men: hence when he harbours them,\nwhen he offers food to them, it is (in discharge of his debt) to them that he\ndoes so. Whoever does all these things, has discharged his duties: by him all\nis obtained, all is conquered.\n\n1:7:2:66\\. And, accordingly, in that he is born as (owing) a debt to the gods,\nin regard to that he satisfies (ava-day) them by sacrificing; and when he\nmakes offerings in the fire, he thereby satisfies them in regard to that\n(debt): hence whatever they offer up in the fire, is called avadanam\n(sacrificial portion) 1.\n\n1:7:2:77\\. Now this (oblation) consists of four cuttings; (the reason for this\nis, that) there is here first, the invitatory prayer (anuvakya), then the\noffering-prayer (ya _g_ ya), then the vasha _t_ -call, and as the fourth, the\ndeity for which the sacrificial food is\n\np. 192\n\n[paragraph continues] (destined): for in this way the deities are dependent on\nthe sacrificial portions, or the portions are dependent on the deities: hence\nwhat fifth cutting there is (made by some), that is redundant, for--for whom\nis he to cut it? For this reason it consists of four cuttings.\n\n1:7:2:88\\. But a fivefold cutting also takes place (with some people):\nfivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim, and five seasons there\nare in the year,--such is the perfection of the fivefold cutting; and he,\nassuredly, will have abundant offspring and cattle for whom, knowing this, the\nfivefold cutting is made. The fourfold cutting, however, is the approved\n(practice) among the Kuru-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas, and for this reason a fourfold\ncutting takes place (with us 1).\n\np. 193\n\n1:7:2:99\\. Let him cut off only a moderate quantity; for were he to cut off a\nlarge quantity, he would make it human; and what is human is inauspicious at\nthe sacrifice. Let him therefore cut off only a moderate quantity, lest he\nshould do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice.\n\n1:7:2:1010\\. Having made an under-layer of butter (in the _g_ uhu-spoon) and\ncut off twice from the havis, he then pours over it some butter. There are,\nindeed, two (kinds of) oblations; the oblation of Soma being one, and the\noblation of (or rather, with) butter being the other. Now the one, viz. the\nSoma-oblation, is (an oblation) by itself; and the other, viz. the butter-\noblation, is the same as the offering of havis (rice, milk, &c.) and the\nanimal offering 1; hence he thereby makes it (the cake) butter, and therefore\nbutter is on both sides of it. Butter, doubtless, is palatable to the gods;\nhence he thereby renders it palatable to the gods: for this reason butter is\non both sides of it.\n\n1:7:2:1111\\. The invitatory prayer (anuvakya, f.), doubtless, is yonder (sky),\nand the offering-prayer (ya _g_ ya, f.) is this (earth)--these two are\nfemales. With each of these two the vasha _t_ -call (vasha _t_ kara, m.) makes\nup a pair 2. Now the vasha _t_ , indeed,\n\np. 194\n\nis no other than that scorching one (the sun). When he rises he approaches\nyonder (sky); and when he sets he approaches this (earth): hence whatever is\nbrought forth here by these two, that they bring forth through that male.\n\n1:7:2:1212\\. Having recited the invitatory prayer and pronounced the offering-\nprayer 1, he afterwards (pa _s_ _k_ at) utters the vasha _t_ formula; for from\nbehind (pa _s_ _k_ at) the male approaches the female: hence, after placing\nthose two in front, he causes them to be approached by that male, the vasha\n_t_. For the same reason let him make the offering either simultaneously with\nthe vasha _t_ or (immediately) after the vasha _t_ has been pronounced.\n\n1:7:2:1313\\. A vessel of the gods, doubtless, is that vasha _t_. Even as,\nafter ladling, one would mete out (food) into a vessel, so here. If, on the\nother hand, he were to make the offering before the vasha _t_ , it would be\nlost, as would be that (food) falling to the ground: for this reason also let\nhim make the offering either simultaneously with the vasha _t_ or after it has\nbeen pronounced.\n\n1:7:2:1414\\. As seed is poured into the womb, so here. If, on the other hand,\nhe were to make the offering before the vasha _t_ , it would be lost, as would\nbe the seed poured not into the womb: for this reason also let him make the\noffering either simultaneously with the vasha _t_ or after it has been\npronounced.\n\n1:7:2:1515\\. The invitatory formula, doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the\noffering-formula is this (earth). The gayatri metre also is this (earth), and\nthe trish _t_ ubh\n\np. 195\n\nis yonder (sky) 1 He recites the gayatri verse, thereby reciting yonder (sky),\nfor the invitatory formula (anuvakya) is yonder (sky). He recites this\n(earth), for the gayatri verse (viz. the offering-formula) is this (earth).\n\n1:7:2:1616\\. He then presents the offering with a trish _t_ ubh verse 2,\nthereby presenting it by means of this\n\np. 196\n\n[paragraph continues] (earth), for the offering-formula (ya _g_ ya) is this\n(earth). Over yonder (sky) he places the vasha _t_ , for yonder (sky) also is\nthe trish _t_ ubh. Thereby he makes those two (sky and earth) yoke-fellows;\nand as such they feed together; and after their common meal all these\ncreatures get food 1.\n\n1:7:2:1717\\. Let him pronounce the invitatory formula lingering, as it were:\nthe invitatory formula, namely, is yonder (sky), and the b _ri_ hat(-saman)\nalso is yonder (sky), since its form is that of the b _ri_ hat. With the\noffering-formula let him, as it were, hurry on fast: the offering-formula,\ndoubtless, is this (earth), and the rathantara(-saman) also is this (earth),\nsince its form is that of the rathantara 2. With the invitatory formula he\ncalls (the gods), and with the\n\np. 197\n\noffering-formula he presents (food to them): hence the invitatory formula\n(anuvakya) has some such form as 'I call,' 'We call,' 'Come hither!' 'Sit on\nthe barhis!' for with it he calls. With the offering-formula (ya _g_ ya) he\noffers: hence the offering-formula has some such form as, 'Accept the\nsacrificial food!' 'Relish the sacrificial food!' 'Accept the potation (av\n_ri_ shayasva)!' 'Eat! Drink! There 1!' for by it he offers that which (is\nindicated by) 'there!'\n\n1:7:2:1818\\. Let the invitatory formula be one that has its distinctive\nindication (in the form of the name of the respective deity) at the beginning\n(in front): for the invitatory formula is yonder (sky); and that (sky) yonder\nhas the moon, the stars, and the sun for its mark below 2.\n\n1:7:2:1919\\. The offering-formula then should be one that has its\ncharacteristic indication (further) back 3; for the offering-formula is this\n(earth), and this same (earth) has plants, trees, waters, fire, and these\ncreatures for its mark above.\n\n1:7:2:2020\\. Verily, that invitatory formula alone is auspicious, in the first\nword of which he utters the (name of the) deity; and that offering-formula\nalone is auspicious in the last word of which he pronounces the vasha _t_ upon\nthe deity 4; for the (name\n\np. 198\n\nof the) deity constitutes the vigour of the _Ri_ _k_ (verse): hence after thus\nenclosing it 1 on both sides with vigour, he offers the sacrificial food to\nthat deity for which it is intended.\n\n1:7:2:2121\\. He pronounces (the syllable) vauk 2; for, assuredly, the vasha\n_t_ -call is speech; and speech means seed: hence he thereby casts seed. 'Sha\n_t_ ' (he pronounces), because there are six seasons: he thereby casts that\nseed into the seasons, and the seasons cause that seed so cast to spring up\nhere as creatures. This is the reason why he pronounces the vasha _t_.\n\n1:7:2:2222\\. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_\napati, entered upon their father Pra _g_ apati's inheritance 3, to wit, these\ntwo half-moons. The gods entered upon the one which waxes, and the Asuras on\nthe one which wanes.\n\n1:7:2:2323\\. The gods were desirous as to how they might appropriate also the\none that had fallen to the Asuras. They went on worshipping and toiling. They\nsaw this havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, to wit, the new- and full-moon sacrifices, and\nperformed them; and by performing them they likewise appropriated the one--\n\n1:7:2:2424\\. Which belonged to the Asuras. Now when these two revolve, then\nthe month is produced; and month (revolving) after month, the year (is\nproduced). But the year, doubtless, means all; hence the gods thereby\nappropriated all that belonged to\n\np. 199\n\nthe Asuras, they deprived their enemies, the Asuras, of all. And in the same\nway he (the sacrificer) who knows this appropriates all that belongs to his\nenemies, deprives his enemies of all.\n\n1:7:2:2525\\. That (half-moon) which belonged to the gods is (called) yavan,\nfor the gods possessed themselves (yu, 'to join') of it; and that which\nbelonged to the Asuras is ayavan, because the Asuras did not possess\nthemselves of it.\n\n1:7:2:2626\\. But they also say contrariwise:--That which belonged to the gods\nis (called) ayavan, because the Asuras did not get possession of it; and that\nwhich belonged to the Asuras is yavan, because the gods did get possession of\nit. The day is (called) sabda, the night sagara, the months yavya, the year\nsumeka 1: sveka ('eminently one'), doubtless, is the same as sumeka. And since\nthe Hot _ri_ is concerned with these--to wit, the yavan and the ayavan, which\n(according to some) is yavan--they call (his office) yavihotram 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[190:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_440) The wording of this passage is very ambiguous; so\nmuch so indeed, that it could also be taken in the sense that 'whoever exists,\nis born as (one to whom) a debt (is owed) from the gods,' &c.; cf. I, 1, 2,\n19: 'Whichever deities are chosen (for the oblations), they consider it as a\ndebt (clue from them), that they are bound to fulfil whatever wish he\nentertains while taking the oblation.' But see Taitt. Br. VI, 3, 10, 5:\n'Verily, a Brahma _n_ a who is born, is born as owing a debt in respect to\nthree things: in the shape of sacred study (brahma _k_ arya) to the _Ri_ shis,\nin the shape of sacrifice to the gods, and in the shape of offspring to the\nfathers. Free from debt, verily, is he who has a son, who is a sacrificer, who\nlives (for a time with a guru) as a religious student.' Ath.-veda VI, 117, 3\n(Taitt. Br. III, 7, 9, 8): 'May we be debtless in this, debtless in the other,\ndebtless in the third, world! What worlds (paths, Taitt. Br.) there are\ntrodden by the gods and trodden by the fathers,--may we abide debtless on all\n(those) paths!'\n\n[191:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_441) The word is really derived from ava-da (do), 'to\ncut off.' The Taitt. Br. gives the same fanciful etymological explanation of\nthe term as here.\n\n[192:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_442) The four 'cuttings' of which each oblation of\nrice-cake consists are made in the following way: first, some clarified\nbutter, 'cut out' or drawn from the butter in the dhruva-spoon by means of the\nsruva (dipping-spoon) and poured into the _g_ uhu (this is called the upastara\n_n_ a or under-layer of butter); second and third, two pieces of the size of a\nthumb's joint, cut out from the centre and the fore-part of the rice-cake and\nlaid on that butter; and fourth, some clarified butter poured on these pieces\nof cake (the technical name of this basting of butter being abhighara _n_ a).\nThe family of the _G_ amadagnis, which is mentioned as always making five\ncuttings (Katy. I, 9, 3-4), take three pieces of cake instead of two, viz. an\nadditional one from the back (or west) part of the cake. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ika Deva\non Katy. quotes a couplet from some Sm _ri_ ti, in which the Vatsas, the\nVidas, and the \xc3\x82rsh _t_ ishe _n_ as are mentioned beside the _G_ amadagnis, as\npa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avattina _h_ or making five cuttings. At the Upa _m_ _s_ uya _g_ a\n(low-voiced offering),--which is performed between the cake-oblation to Agni\nand that to Agni-Soma at the full moon, and between the cake-oblation to Agni\nand that to Indra-Agni (or the sannayya, or oblation of sweet and sour milk,\nto Indra) at the new moon, and which consists entirely of butter,--the four\ncuttings are effected in the same way as described p. 193 page\n[174](sbe1228.htm#page_174) note. At the sannayya, two (or three) sruva-fuls\nof both the sweet and the sour milk take the place of the two (or three)\npieces of cake.\n\n[193:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_443) See page [26](sbe1206.htm#page_26), note\n[1](sbe1206.htm#fn_125). The parts of the cakes or the sannayya, from which\ncuttings have been made, he bastes, each once, with butter taken with the\nsruva from the butter-pot; and whenever butter is ladled with the sruva from\nthe dhruva into the _g_ uhu, the former is replenished from the butter-pot.\n\n[193:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_444) Tayor mithunam asti vasha _t_ kara eva, 'to these\ntwo the vasha _t_ -call is the complement in forming a pair.' On the vasha _t_\n(vausha _t_ ) and the other two formulas, see note on I, 5, 2, 16.\n\n[194:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_445) The usual formalities, which have been detailed\nbefore (see page [174](sbe1228.htm#page_174) note), have, of course, to be\ngone through at each oblation.\n\n[195:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_446) In this passage the invitatory formula (anuvakya\nor puro'nuvakya), which is in the gayatri metre, is identified with the sky,\nand the offering-formula (ya _g_ ya), which is in the trish _t_ ubh metre,\nwith the earth. On the other hand, the gayatri also is the earth (cf. I, 4, I,\n34), and the trish _t_ ubh the sky; so that, according to this mode of\nreasoning, there is not only an intimate connection between the two metres,\nbut actual identity. The gayatri verse, used as invitatory formula, on the\noccasion of the rice-cake offering to Agni, is Rig-veda VIII, 4.4, 16 [agnir\nmurdha diva _h_ kakut, 'Agni, the head and summit of the sky,' &c.]; with that\nto Agni and Soma, at the full-moon sacrifice, Rig-veda I, 93, 3 [agnishomau\nsavedasau, sahuti vanatam gira _h_ , 'O Agni and Soma, of self-same wealth and\ninvocation, accept this song!' &c.]; and to Indra and Agni, at the new moon,\nRig-veda VII, 94, 7 [indragni avasa gatam, 'O Indra and Agni, come to us with\nfavour I' &c.] or with the (optional) milk-offering (sannayyam), at the new\nmoon, Rig-veda I, 8, 1 [endra sanasi _m_ rayim, hither, O Indra, bring\nabundant treasure!!' &c.], if to Indra; or Rig-veda VIII, 6, 1 [maha\xe1\xb9\x85 indro ya\no _g_ asa par _g_ anyo v _ri_ sh _t_ ima\xe1\xb9\x85 iva, 'the Great Indra, who in might\nis equal to the rainy thunder-cloud,' &c.], if to Mahendra.\n\n[195:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_447) The trish _t_ ubh verse, used as offering-formula\nwith the oblation of cake to Agni, both at the new and full moon, is Rig-veda\nX, 8, 6 [bhuvo ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya ra _g_ asa _s_ _k_ a neta . . . agne . . ., 'be\nthou the leader of the sacrifice and welkin, . . . O Agni!' &c.]; with that to\nAgni and Soma, at the full moon, Rig-veda I, 93, 5 [yuvam etani divi ro _k_\nanani . . . agnishomau . . ., 'you, O Agni and Soma, (fixed) those lights in\nthe heaven,' &c.]; with that to Indra and Agni, at the new moon, Rig-veda VII,\n93 4 [girbhir vipra _h_ pramatim i _k_ _kh_ amana, .. indragni . . ., 'the\nbard, seeking your grace by songs . . ., O Indra and Agni,' &c.]; and with the\nmilk-offering, at the same sacrifice, if to Indra, Rig-veda X, 180, 1 [pra\nsasahishe puruhuta _s_ atrun . . . indra . . ., thou, O Indra, the much-\ninvoked, hast vanquished the enemies!' &c.]; or, if to Mahendra, Rig-veda X,\n50, 4 [bhuvas p. 196 tvam indra brahma _n_ a mahan, 'mighty, O Indra, mayest\nthou be through (our) prayer!' &c.].\n\n[196:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_448) For the notion that there is rain (and\nconsequently food) when heaven and earth are on friendly terms with each\nother, see I, 8, 3, 12. The rain is the food of the earth; and the food,\nproduced thereby, in its turn furnishes food for the sky (or the gods) in the\nform of oblations.\n\n[196:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_449) The b _ri_ hat-saman (tvam id dhi havamahe, 'on\nthee, indeed, we call,' &c., Sama-veda II, 159-160 = Rig-veda VI, 46, 1-2) and\nthe rathantara-saman (abhi tva _s_ ura nonuma _h_ , 'to thee, O Hero, we\ncall,' &c., Sama-veda II, 30-31 = Rig-veda VII, 32, 22-23) are two of the most\nhighly prized Sama-hymns, which are especially used in forming the so-called p\n_ri_ sh _th_ as, or combinations of two hymns in such a way that one of them\n(being a mystic representation of the embryo) is enclosed in the other, which\nis supposed to represent the womb. In these symbolical combinations the b _ri_\nhat and rathantara, which must never be used together, are often employed as\nthe enclosing chants, representative of the womb. They are already mentioned\nin Rig-veda X, 181. See also _S_ at. Br. IX, 1, 2, 36-37. Taitt. S. VII, 1, I,\n4, Pra _g_ apati is said to have first created from his mouth Agni together\nwith the Gayatri, the Rathantara-saman, the Brahma _n_ a, and the goat; and\nthen from his chest and arms Indra, the Trish _t_ ubh, the B _ri_ hat-saman,\nthe Ra _g_ anya, and the ram.\n\n[197:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_450) Literally, 'forwards, thither (pra).'\n\n[197:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_451) Avastallakshma, 'the sign below or on this (the,\nto us, nearest or front) side.' See the formulas above, p. 195, note 1.\n\n[197:3](sbe1231.htm#fr_452) Or upwards, on the upper side, uparish _t_\nallaksha _n_ am. See the offering-formulas above, p. 195, note 2.\n\n[197:4](sbe1231.htm#fr_453) Vasha _t_ , or rather vausha _t_ ['may he (Agni)\ncarry it (to the gods)!'], is pronounced after each ya _g_ ya or offering-\nformula, which contains the name of the deity towards the end, or at least not\nat the very beginning.\n\n[198:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_454) Viz. the invitatory and offering-formulas.\n\n[198:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_455) The sacrificial call vausha _t_ (for vasha _t_ ,\nirregular aorist of vah, 'to bear,' cf. [p. 88](sbe1214.htm#page_88), note\n[2](sbe1214.htm#fn_254)) is here fancifully explained as composed of vauk, for\nvak, 'speech,' + sha _t_ , 'six.'\n\n[198:3](sbe1231.htm#fr_456) Pra _g_ apati, or Lord of Creatures, is here, as\noften (cf. I, 2, 5, 13), taken as representing the year, or Time.\n\n[199:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_457) Sumeka is taken by the St. Petersburg Dictionary\nto mean 'firmly established;' by Grassmann, 'bountiful,' literally 'well-\nshowering.' Our author identifies it with su-eka. The words sabdam ( _s_\nabdam, Ka _n_ va rec., ? = the sounding one) and sagara are obscure; yavya\nhere apparently means, 'consisting of the yavas or half-months.'\n\n[199:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_458) The term yavihotram is obscure, and does not seem\nto occur anywhere else. The Ka _n_ va MS. reads yamihotram (? = _g_\namihotram). Saya _n_ a's comment is corrupt in several places and affords\nlittle help.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 7, 3. Third Brahma _n_ a](sbe1232.htm)\n\n"
