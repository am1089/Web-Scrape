Vai _s_ vanara (is the highest Lord) on account of the distinction\nqualifying the common terms (Vai _s_ vanara and Self).\n\n(In _Kh_. Up. V, 11 ff.) a discussion begins with the words, 'What is our\nSelf, what is Brahman?' and is carried on in the passage, 'You know at present\nthat Vai _s_ vanara Self, tell us that;' after that it is declared with\nreference to Heaven, sun, air, ether, water, and earth, that they are\nconnected with the qualities of having good light, &c., and, in order to\ndisparage devout meditation on them singly, that they stand to the Vai _s_\nvanara in the relation of being his head, &c., merely; and then finally (V,\n18) it is said, 'But he who meditates on the Vai _s_ vanara Self as measured\nby a span, as abhivimana 1, he eats food in all worlds, in all beings, in all\nSelfs. Of that Vai _s_ vanara Self the head is Sute _g_ as (having good\nlight), the eye Vi _s_ varupa (multiform), the breath P _ri_ thagvartman\n(moving in various courses), the trunk Bahula (full), the bladder Rayi\n(wealth), the feet the earth, the chest the altar, the hairs the grass on the\naltar, the heart the Garhapatya fire, the mind the Anvaharya fire, the mouth\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya fire.'--Here the doubt arises whether by the term 'Vai _s_\nvanara' we have to understand the gastric fire, or the elemental fire, or the\ndivinity presiding over the latter, or the embodied soul, or the highest Lord.\n--But what, it may be asked, gives rise to this doubt?--The circumstance, we\nreply, of 'Vai _s_ vanara' being employed as a common term for the gastric\nfire, the elemental fire, and the divinity of the latter, while 'Self' is a\nterm applying to the embodied soul as well as to the highest Lord. Hence the\ndoubt arises which meaning of the term is to be accepted and which to be set\naside.\n\nWhich, then, is the alternative to be embraced?--Vai _s_ vanara, the\npurvapakshin maintains, is the gastric fire, because we meet, in some\npassages, with the term used in\n\np. 144\n\nthat special sense; so, for instance (B _ri_. Up. V, 9), 'Agni Vai _s_ vanara\nis the fire within man by which the food that is eaten is cooked.'--Or else\nthe term may denote fire in general, as we see it used in that sense also; so,\nfor instance ( _Ri_ g-veda Sa _m_ h. X, 88, 12), 'For the whole world the gods\nhave made the Agni Vai _s_ vanara a sign of the days.' Or, in the third place,\nthe word may denote that divinity whose body is fire. For passages in which\nthe term has that sense are likewise met with; compare, for instance, _Ri_\ng-veda Sa _m_ h. I, 98, 1, 'May we be in the favour of Vai _s_ vanara; for he\nis the king of the beings, giving pleasure, of ready grace;' this and similar\npassages properly applying to a divinity endowed with power and similar\nqualities. Perhaps it will be urged against the preceding explanations, that,\nas the word Vai _s_ vanara is used in co-ordination with the term 'Self,' and\nas the term 'Self' alone is used in the introductory passage ('What is our\nSelf, what is Brahman?'), Vai _s_ vanara has to be understood in a modified\nsense, so as to be in harmony with the term Self. Well, then, the purvapakshin\nrejoins, let us suppose that Vai _s_ vanara is the embodied Self which, as\nbeing an enjoyer, is in close vicinity to the Vai _s_ vanara fire, 1 (i.e. the\nfire within the body,) and with which the qualification expressed by the term,\n'Measured by a span,' well agrees, since it is restricted by its limiting\ncondition (viz. the body and so on).--In any case it is evident that the term\nVai _s_ vanara does not denote the highest Lord.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--The word Vai _s_ vanara denotes the\nhighest Self, on account of the distinction qualifying the two general terms.\n--Although the term 'Self,' as well as the term 'Vai _s_ vanara,' has various\nmeanings--the latter term denoting three beings while the former denotes two--\nyet we observe a distinction from which we conclude that both terms can here\ndenote the highest Lord only; viz. in the passage, 'Of that Vai _s_ vanara\nSelf the head is Sute _g_ as,' &c. For it is clear that that passage refers to\nthe highest Lord in so far as he is distinguished by having heaven, and so on,\nfor his head and limbs, and in so far as\n\np. 145\n\nhe has entered into a different state (viz. into the state of being the Self\nof the threefold world); represents him, in fact, for the purpose of\nmeditation, as the internal Self of everything. As such the absolute Self may\nbe represented, because it is the cause of everything; for as the cause\nvirtually contains all the states belonging to its effects, the heavenly\nworld, and so on, may be spoken of as the members of the highest Self.--\nMoreover, the result which Scripture declares to abide in all worlds--viz. in\nthe passage, 'He eats food in all worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs'--is\npossible only if we take the term Vai _s_ vanara to denote the highest Self.--\nThe same remark applies to the declaration that all the sins are burned of him\nwho has that knowledge, 'Thus all his sins are burned,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. V, 24,\n3).--Moreover, we meet at the beginning of the chapter with the words 'Self'\nand 'Brahman;' viz. in the passage, 'What is our Self, what is Brahman?' Now\nthese are marks of Brahman, and indicate the highest Lord only. Hence he only\ncan be meant by the term Vai _s_ vanara.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[143:1](sbe34061.htm#fr_157) About which term see later on.\n\n[144:1](sbe34061.htm#fr_158) Sarire laksha _n_ aya vai _s_ vanara _s_\nabdopapattim aha tasyeti. \xc3\x82n.
