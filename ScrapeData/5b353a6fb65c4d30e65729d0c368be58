II.\n\nOf the seven future Manus and Manwantaras. Story of Sanjna and Chhaya, wives\nof the sun. Savarn\xcc\x81i, son of Chhaya, the eighth Manu. His successors, with the\ndivinities, &c. of their respective periods. Appearance of\n[Vishn\xcc\x81u](errata.htm#11) in each of the four Yugas.\n\nMAITREYA.--You have recapitulated to me, most excellent Brahman, the\nparticulars of the past Manwantaras; now give me some account of those which\nare to come.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Sanjna, the daughter of Vi\xc5\x9bwakarman, was the wife of the sun, and\nbore him three children, the Manu (Vaivaswata), Yama, and the goddess Yami (or\nthe Yamuna river). Unable to endure the fervours of her lord, Sanjna gave him\nChhaya 1 as his handmaid, and repaired to the forests to practise devout\nexercises. The sun, supposing Chhaya to be his wife Sanjna, begot by her three\nother children, \xc5\x9aanai\xc5\x9bchara (Saturn), another Manu (Savarn\xcc\x81i), and a daughter\nTapati (the Tapti river). Chhaya, upon one occasion, being offended with Yama\n2, the son of Sanjna, denounced an imprecation upon him, and thereby revealed\nto Yama and to the sun that she was not in truth Sanjna, the mother of the\nformer. Being further informed by Chhaya that his wife had gone to the\nwilderness, the sun beheld her by the eye of meditation engaged in\nausterities, in the figure of a mare (in the region of Uttara Kuru).\nMetamorphosing himself into a horse, he rejoined his wife, and begot three\nother children, the two \xc3\x81swins and Revanta, and\n\np. 267\n\nthen brought Sanjna back to his own dwelling. To diminish his intensity,\nVi\xc5\x9bwakarman placed the luminary on his lathe, to grind off some of his\neffulgence; and in this manner reduced it an eighth, for more than that was\ninseparable 3. The parts of the divine Vaishn\xcc\x81ava splendour, residing in the\nsun, that were filed off by Vi\xc5\x9bwakarman, fell blazing down upon the earth, and\nthe artist constructed of them the discus of Vishn\xcc\x81u, the trident of \xc5\x9aiva, the\nweapon 4 of the god of wealth, the lance of Kartikeya, and the weapons of the\nother gods: all these Vi\xc5\x9bwakarman fabricated from the superfluous rays of the\nsun 5.\n\nThe son of Chhaya, who was called also a Manu, was denominated Savarn\xcc\x81i 6,\nfrom being of the same caste (Savarn\xcc\x81a) as his elder brother, the Manu\nVaivaswata. He presides over the ensuing or eighth Manwantara; the particulars\nof which, and the following, I will now relate. In the period in which\nSavarn\xcc\x81i shall be the Manu, the classes of the gods will be Sutapas,\nAmitabhas, and Mukhyas; twenty-one of each. The seven Rishis will be Diptimat,\nGalava, Rama, Kripa, Draun\xcc\x81i; my son Vyasa will be the sixth, and the seventh\nwill be Rishyasringa 7. The Indra will be Bali, the sinless son of Virochana,\nwho through the favour of Vishn\xcc\x81u is actually sovereign of part of Patala. The\nroyal progeny of Savarn\xcc\x81i will be Virajas, Arvarivas, Nirmoha, and others.\n\np. 268\n\nThe ninth Manu will be Daksha-savarn\xcc\x81i 8. The Paras, Marichigarbhas, and\nSudharmas will be the three classes of divinities, each consisting of twelve;\ntheir powerful chief will be the Indra Adbhuta. Savana, Dyutimat, Bhavya,\nVasu, Medhatithi, Jyotishman, and Satya will be the seven Rishis. Dhritaketu,\nDriptiketu, Panchahasta, Mahamaya, Prithu\xc5\x9brava, and others, will be the sons\nof the Manu.\n\nIn the tenth Manwantara the Manu will be Brahma-savarn\xcc\x81i: the gods will be the\nSudhamas, Viruddhas, and \xc5\x9aatasankhyas: the Indra will be the mighty \xc5\x9aanti: the\nRishis will be Havishman, Sukriti, Satya, Apammurtti, Nabhaga, Apratimaujas,\nand Satyaketu: and the ten sons of the Manu will be Sukshetra, Uttarnaujas,\nHarishen\xcc\x81a, and others.\n\nIn the eleventh Manwantara the Manu will be Dharma-savarn\xcc\x81i: the principal\nclasses of gods will be the Vihangamas, Kamagamas, and Nirmanaratis, each\nthirty in number 9; of whom Vrisha will be the Indra: the Rishis will be\nNi\xc5\x9bchara, Agnitejas, Vapushman, Vishn\xcc\x81u, \xc3\x81runi, Havishman, and Anagha: the\nkings of the earth, and sons of the Manu, will be Savarga, Sarvadharma,\nDevanika, and others.\n\nIn the twelfth Manwantara the son of Rudra, Savarn\xcc\x81i, will be the Manu:\nRitudhama will be the Indra: and the Haritas, Lohitas, Sumanasas, and Sukarmas\nwill be the classes of gods, each comprising fifteen.\n\np. 269\n\n[paragraph continues] Tapaswi, Sutapas, Tapomurtti, Taporati, Tapodhriti,\nTapodyuti, and Tapodhana will be the Rishis: and Devavan, Upadeva,\nDeva\xc5\x9bresht\xcc\x81a, and others, will be the Manu's sons, and mighty monarchs on the\nearth.\n\nIn the thirteenth Manwantara the Manu will be Rauchya 10: the classes of gods,\nthirty-three in each, will be the Sudhamans, Sudharmans, and Sukarmans; their\nIndra will be Divaspati: the Rishis will be Nirmoha, Tatwadersin,\nNishprakampa, Nirutsuka, Dhritimat, Avyaya, and Sutapas: and Chitrasena,\nVichitra, and others, will be the kings.\n\nIn the fourteenth Manwantara, Bhautya will be the Manu 11; Suchi, the Indra:\nthe five classes of gods will be the Chakshushas, the Pavitras, Kanisht\xcc\x81has,\nBhrajiras, and Vavriddhas: the seven Rishis will be Agnibahu, \xc5\x9auchi, \xc5\x9aukra,\nMagadha, Gridhra, Yukta, and Ajita: and the sons of the Manu will be Uru,\nGabhira, Bradhna, and others, who will be kings, and will rule over the earth\n12.\n\nAt the end of every four ages there is a disappearance of the Vedas, and it is\nthe province of the seven Rishis to come down upon earth from heaven to give\nthem currency again. In every Krita age the Manu (of the period) is the\nlegislator or author of the body of law, the Smriti: the\n\np. 270\n\ndeities of the different classes receive the sacrifices during the Manwantaras\nto which they severally belong: and the sons of the Manu them. selves, and\ntheir descendants, are the sovereigns of the earth for the whole of the same\nterm. The Manu, the seven Rishis, the gods, the sons of the Manu, who are the\nkings, and Indra, are the beings who preside over the world during each\nManwantara.\n\nAn entire Kalpa, oh Brahman, is said to comprise a thousand ages, or fourteen\nManwantaras 13; and it is succeeded by a night of similar duration; during\nwhich, he who wears the form of Brahma, Janarddana, the substance of all\nthings, the lord of all, and creator of all, involved in his own illusions,\nand having swallowed up the three spheres, sleeps upon the serpent \xc5\x9aesha,\namidst the ocean 14. Being after that awake, he, who is the universal soul,\nagain creates all things as they were before, in combination with the property\nof foulness (or activity): and in a portion of his essence, associated with\nthe property of goodness, he, as the Manus, the kings, the gods, and their\nIndras, as well as the seven Rishis, is the preserver of the world. In what\nmanner Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is characterised by the attribute of providence during the\nfour ages, effected their preservation, I will next, Maitreya, explain.\n\nIn the Krita age, Vishn\xcc\x81u, in the form of Kapila and other inspired teachers,\nassiduous for the benefit of all creatures, imparts to them true wisdom. In\nthe Treta age he restrains the wicked, in the form of a universal monarch, and\nprotects the three worlds 15. In the Dwapara age, in the person of Veda-vyasa,\nhe divides the one Veda into four, and\n\np. 271\n\ndistributes it into innumerable branches: and at the end of the Kali or fourth\nage he appears as Kalki, and reestablishes the iniquitous in the paths of\nrectitude. In this manner the universal spirit preserves, creates, and at last\ndestroys, all the world.\n\nThus, Brahman, I have described to you the true nature of that great being who\nis all things, and besides whom there is no other existent thing, nor has\nthere been, nor will there be, either here or elsewhere. I have also\nenumerated to you the Manwantaras, and those who preside over them. What else\ndo you wish to hear?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[266:1](vp076.htm#fr_766) That is, her shadow or image. It also means 'shade.'\nThe Bhagavata, however, makes both Sanjna and Chhaya daughters of Vi\xc5\x9bwakarman.\nAccording to the Matsya, Vivaswat, the son of Ka\xc5\x9byapa and Aditi, had three\nwives, Rajni, the daughter of Raivata, by whom he had Revanta; Prabha, by whom\nhe had Prabhata; and by Sanjna, the daughter of Twasht\xcc\x81ri, the Manu and Yama\nand Yamuna. The story then proceeds much as in the text.\n\n[266:2](vp076.htm#fr_767) Yama, provoked at her partiality for her own\nchildren, abused Chhaya, and lifted up his foot to kick her. She cursed him to\nhave his leg affected with sores and worms; but his father bestowed upon him a\ncock, to eat the worms, and remove the discharge; and Yama, afterwards\npropitiating Mahadeva, obtained the rank of Lokapala, and sovereign of\nTartarus.\n\n[267:3](vp076.htm#fr_768) The Matsya says he trimmed the sun every where\nexcept in the feet, the extent of which he could not discern. Consequently in\npictures or images the feet of the sun must never be delineated, under pain of\nleprosy, &c.\n\n[267:4](vp076.htm#fr_769) The term is \xc5\x9aivika, which properly means 'a litter,'\nThe commentator calls it Astra, 'a weapon.'\n\n[267:5](vp076.htm#fr_770) This legend is told, with some variations of no\ngreat importance, in the Matsya, Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, and Padma P. (Swarga Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a),\nin the Bhagavata, and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, &c.\n\n[267:6](vp076.htm#fr_771) The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, whilst it admits Savarn\xcc\x81i to be\nthe son of the sun, has a legend of his former birth, in the Swarochisha\nManwantara, as Suratha Raja, who became a Manu by having then propitiated\nDevi. It was to him that the Durga Mahatmya or Chan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81i, the popular narrative\nof Durga's triumphs over various demons, was narrated.\n\n[267:7](vp076.htm#fr_772) The Vayu has Jamadagnya or Para\xc5\x9burama, of the Ku\xc5\x9bika\nrace; Galava, of that of Bhrigu; Dwaipayana (or Vyasa), of the family of\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha; Kripa, the son of \xc5\x9aaradwat; Diptimat, descended from Atri;\nRishyasringa, from Ka\xc5\x9byapa; and Aswatthaman, the son of Dron\xcc\x81a, of the\nBharadwaja family. The Matsya and Padma have Satananda in place of Diptimat.\n\n[268:8](vp076.htm#fr_773) The four following Savarn\xcc\x81is are described in the\nVayu as the mind-engendered sons of a daughter of Daksha, named either Suvrata\n(Vayu) or Priya (Brahma) by himself and the three gods, Brahma, Dharma, and\nRudra, to whom he presented her on mount Meru; whence they are called also\nMeru-savarn\xcc\x81is. They are termed Savarn\xcc\x81is from their being of one family or\ncaste. According to the same authority, followed by the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, it appears\nthat this Manu is also called Rohita. Most of the details of this and the\nfollowing Manwantaras are omitted in the Matsya, Brahma, Padma, and\nMarkan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81as. The Bhagavata and Kurma give the same as our text; and\nthe Vayu, which agrees very nearly with it, is followed in most respects by\nthe Hari Van\xc5\x9ba. The Matsya and Padma are peculiar in their series and\nnomenclature of the Manus themselves, calling the 9th Rauchya, 10th Bhautya,\n11th Merusavarn\xcc\x81i, son of Brahma, 12th Ritu, 13th Ritadhaman, and 14th\nViswaksena. The Bhagavata calls the two last Manus, Deva-savarn\xcc\x81i and Indra-\nsavarn\xcc\x81i.\n\n[268:9](vp076.htm#fr_774) Hence the Vayu identifies the first with days, the\nsecond with nights, and the third with hours.\n\n[269:10](vp076.htm#fr_775) The son of the Prajapati Ruchi (Vayu, &c.), by the\nnymph Manini, the daughter of the Apsaras Pramlocha (Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya).\n\n[269:11](vp076.htm#fr_776) Son of Ravi, by the goddess Bhuti, according to the\nVayu; but the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya makes Bhuti the son of Angiras, whose pupil \xc5\x9aanti,\nhaving suffered the holy fire to go out in his master's absence, prayed to\nAgni, and so propitiated him, that he not only relighted the flame, but\ndesired \xc5\x9aanti to demand a further boon. \xc5\x9aanti accordingly solicited a son for\nhis Guru; which son was Bhuti, the father of the Manu Bhautya.\n\n[269:12](vp076.htm#fr_777) Although the Puran\xcc\x81as which give an account of the\nManwantaras agree in some of the principal details, yet in the minor ones they\noffer many varieties, some of which have been noticed. These chiefly regard\nthe first six and the eighth. Except in a few individual peculiarities, the\nauthorities seem to arrange themselves in two classes; one comprehending the\nVishn\xcc\x81u, Vayu, Kurma, Bhagavata, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya; and the other the Matsya,\nPadma, Brahma, and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, although it agrees precisely\nwith the Vishn\xcc\x81u in its nomenclature, differs from it, and from all, in\ndevoting a considerable number of its pages to legends of the origin of the\nManus, all of which are evidently of comparatively recent invention, and\nseveral of which have been no doubt suggested by the etymology of the names of\nthe Manus.\n\n[270:13](vp076.htm#fr_778) A thousand ages of the gods and fourteen\nManwantaras are not precisely the same thing, as has been already explained.\n(See [p. 24](vp037.htm#page_24). n. [6](vp037.htm#fn_155).)\n\n[270:14](vp076.htm#fr_779) The order of the text would imply, that as Brahma\nhe sleeps upon \xc5\x9aesha; but if this be intended, it is at variance with the\nusual legend, that it is as Vishn\xcc\x81u or Narayan\xcc\x81a that the deity sleeps in the\nintervals of dissolution. The commentator accordingly qualifies the phrase\nBrahmarupadhara by the term Diva: 'Vishn\xcc\x81u wears the form of Brahma by day; by\nnight he sleeps on \xc5\x9aesha, in the person of Narayan\xcc\x81a.' This however may be\nsuspected to be an innovation upon an older system; for in speaking of the\nalternations of creation and dissolution, they are always considered as\nconsentaneous with the day and night of Brahma alone.\n\n[270:15](vp076.htm#fr_780) As a Chakravarttin.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III](vp077.htm)\n\n"
