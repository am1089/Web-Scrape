Because speech is preceded by that (viz. fire and the other elements).\n\nAlthough in the chapter, 'That sent forth fire,' &c., the origin of the pra\n_n_ as is not mentioned, the origin of the three elements, fire, water, and\nearth only being stated, nevertheless, the fact of the text declaring that\nspeech, pra _n_ a, and mind presuppose fire, water, and earth--which in their\nturn have Brahman for their causal substance--proves that they--and, by parity\nof reasoning, all pra _n_ as--have sprung from Brahman. That speech, pra _n_\na, and mind presuppose fire, water, and earth is told in the same chapter,\n'For truly, my child, mind consists of earth, breath of water,\n\np. 79\n\nspeech of fire' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 5, 4). If their consisting of earth and so on\nis taken literally, it follows at once that they have sprung from Brahman. And\nif it be taken in a metaphorical sense only, yet, as the sentence forms part\nof the chapter which treats of the evolution of names and forms effected by\nBrahman; and as the introductory phrase runs, 'That by which we hear what is\nnot heard' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 1, 3); and as the concluding passage is 'In it all\nthat exists has its Self' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 7); and as the matter is moreover\nknown from other scriptural passages; we understand that also the statement\nabout mind and so on consisting of earth, &c., is meant to teach that they are\nproducts of Brahman.--It is therefore an established conclusion that the pra\n_n_ as also are effects of Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 5](sbe38059.htm)\n\n"
