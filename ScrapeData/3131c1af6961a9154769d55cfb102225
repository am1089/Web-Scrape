Again, what may not be given is eightfold; what may be given is of one kind only; of valid gifts there are seven species; and sixteen sorts of invalid gifts.\n\n* 4. 4 An Anvahita deposit, a Ya _k_ ita, a pledge, joint property, a deposit, a son, a wife, the whole property of one who has offspring,\n\n* 5. And what has been promised to another man; these have been declared by the spiritual guides to be inalienable by one in the worst plight even.\n\n* 6. 6 What is left (of the property) after the expense of maintaining the family has been defrayed,\n\np. 129\n\nmay be given. But by giving away anything besides, a householder will incur\ncensure.\n\n7. 7 He who has, for three years, property sufficient to provide for those whom he is bound to maintain, or who has even more than that, shall drink the Soma juice.\n\n* 8. 8 The price paid for merchandise, wages, (a present offered) for an amusement, (a gift made) from affection, or from gratitude, or for sexual intercourse with a woman, and a respectful gift, are the seven kinds of valid gifts.\n\n* 9. 9 Invalid gifts are the following (sixteen): what\n\np. 130\n\nhas been given by a man under the influence of fear, anger, hatred, sorrow or\npain; or as a bribe; or in jest; or fraudulently, under false pretences;\n\n* 10. Or by a child; or by a fool; or by a person not his own master; or by one distressed; or by one intoxicated; or by one insane; or in consideration of a reward, thinking 'This man will show me some service;\n\n* 11. And so is invalid what was given from ignorance to an unworthy man thought to be worthy, or for a purpose (thought to be) virtuous.\n\n* 12. Both the donee who covets invalid gifts and accepts them from avarice, and the donor of what ought not to be given who yet gives it away, deserve punishment.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[128:1](sbe3336.htm#fr_372) IV, 1. 'Unduly' means in a mode opposed to law.\nMitakshara, Viramitrodaya, Mayukha, &c. Manu VIII, 214.\n\n[128:2](sbe3336.htm#fr_373) 'Valid gifts,' literally 'what is given.' 'Invalid\ngifts,' literally 'what is not given.'\n\n[128:4](sbe3336.htm#fr_374) For the meaning of the technical terms, Anvahita\nand Ya _k_ ita, see II, 14. The prohibition of such gifts as would leave the\nfamily destitute appears to relate principally to charitable donations and\nreligious endowments.\n\n4-6. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 175.\n\n[128:6](sbe3336.htm#fr_375) That only may be given which is left after the\ncost of living has been defrayed for those whom the head of the family is\nbound to support. Any gift, on the other hand, which causes hardship to the\nfamily, is reprehensible, and not meritorious. A.\n\n[129:7](sbe3336.htm#fr_376) This rule applies to those cases where there is\nmore wealth than what suffices to maintain the family. A. Manu XI, 7; Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 124; Vasish _th_ a VIII, 10; Vish _n_ u LIX, 8.\n\n[129:8](sbe3336.htm#fr_377) Those gifts only are valid which have been made in\none of the seven modes here mentioned. The sixteen other modes of gift are\nillegal. A. 'A present offered for an amusement,' i.e. what has been given to\nbards, eulogists, and the like persons. 'A gift made from affection,' to a\ndaughter or other relative. Viramitrodaya, &c. Instead of stribhakti, 'sexual\nintercourse with a woman,' the MSS. of Vulg. and the quotations read stri _s_\nulka, 'a nuptial gift presented to the relations of the wife.'\n\n[129:9](sbe3336.htm#fr_378) 9-11. 1. 'Fear,' as e.g. if an honest man promises\none hundred drachmas to a ruffian who addresses him, while he is passing\nthrough a forest, with the words, 'If thou givest me one hundred drachmas,\nthou shalt live. Otherwise, thou shalt die.' 2. 'Anger, or hatred:' if a man,\nactuated by jealousy, says to a Brahman, to whom his wife has offered a seat,\n'All the furniture which you see in this house shall be yours.' 3. 'Sorrow:'\nif a man, in a heavy affliction, declares, 'I will go into the forest. My\nhouse has been given to Brahmans to-day.' 4. 'Pain:' a man distressed by a\npainful illness, says to a Brahman, 'I have given thee one hundred _S_ uvar\n_n_ as.' 5. 'A bribe:' a litigant says to an assessor of the court, 'I will\ngive thee one hundred Pa _n_ as if my cause is declared victorious by thee.'\n6. 'In jest,' what has been laughingly given. 7. 'Under false pretences,' as\ne.g. under the following circumstances:\xc2\x97A libidinous man is enamoured of a\npublic woman, by the name of _K_ utama _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ari ('Mango Bud'). He is\ndeprived of her p. 130 by a Thakur, and is bewailing his separation from her.\nSome one asks him whether he will make him a present of a ring, in case he\nshould bring _K_ utama _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ari before him. He promises to give the ring\nand offers a surety for it. Thereupon the other exhibits a Mango bud ( _K_\nutama _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ari) to him, instead of the woman _K_ utama _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ari. 8. What\nwas given by a child. 9. What was given by a fool. 10. What was given by a\nperson not his own master. 11. What was given by one distressed, as e.g. if a\nman being carried away by a current of water exclaims, 'I will give one\nhundred _S_ uvar _n_ as to any one who saves my life.' 12. What was given by\none inebriated. 13. What was given by one insane or possessed by a demon. 14.\nWhat was given through a hope of recompense, in expectation of some service to\nbe performed by the donee. 15. What was given to an unworthy man, from\nignorance, as e.g. to a _S_ udra, whom the donor fancied to be a Brahman,\nbecause he saw him girt with the sacred thread. 16. What was given for a\npurpose (thought to be) virtuous, as e.g. if a devout man has made a religious\nendowment, and the donee employs it for gambling or libidinous purposes. A.\nOther jurists construe these texts somewhat differently, in order to obtain\nthe sixteen sorts of void gifts distinguished by Narada. Manu VIII, 212.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fifth Title of Law.
