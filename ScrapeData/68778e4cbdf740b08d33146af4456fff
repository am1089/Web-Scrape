Vyasa said :-- O King! I am describing to you that excellent pure life\nand doings of the Devi that destroy all the sins of all the beings and make\nthem happy. In days of yore, there were two very powerful demons S\xc2\x92umbha and\nNis\xc2\x92umbha; they were two brothers, strong heroes and invulnerable by the male\npersons. Those two wicked Asuras were surrounded with numerable Danavas; they\ntormented always the Devas. Then the Goddess Ambika, for the good of the\nDevas, killed S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha with all their attendants in a very\ndreadful battle. In the battlefield the Devi killed their main assistants Cha\n_nd_ a Mu _nd_ a and the exceedingly terrible Rakta Vija and Dhumralochana.\nWhen the Devi destroyed those Danavas, the Devas became fearless; the Devas\nthen went to the beautiful Sumeru mountain and praised Her and chanted hymns\nto Her.\n\n\n\n7-8. Hearing about the names of S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha, Janamejaya asked :-- O\nbest of Munis! Who were those two Asuras? How came\n\n\n\np. 426\n\n\n\nthey to be most powerful? Who put them here? Why were they vulnerable to women\nonly? Under whose tapasya and under whose boon did they become so strong? And\nwhy did that great Devi kill them? Describe all these to me in detail.\n\n\n\n9-20. Vyasa said :-- O King, I am describing to you that beautiful anecdote\nwhere the Devi\xc2\x92s holy deeds are involved. Hear. This incident full of all that\nis good, destroys the hearer\xc2\x92s all sins and grants them all their desired\nends. In days of yore, S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha, the two fair and good looking\nbrothers came out of Patala to this earth. These two Asuras, when they grew to\ntheir manhood, performed severe asceticism in Pu _s_ kara, the holy place of\npilgrimage, the most purifying place in this world and they refused to eat\nrice and water. They became so very skilled in their Yoga practices that they\npassed away in their one posture and seat one Ajuta (10,000) years. Thus they\nperformed very difficult Tapasya. Then the God Brahma, the Grandsire of all,\nbecame pleased with their asceticism and appeared before them, riding on His\nvehicle, the Swan. The Creator, seeing them thus deeply merged in meditation,\nasked them to get up from that state and told them thus :-- \xc2\x93I have become\npleased with your asceticism. I fulfil the desires of all the Lokas; I have\nnow come to you, pleased to see you so very strong in your ascetic practices;\nbetter ask your desired boons from me; I will grant them to you.\xc2\x94 Vyasa said\n:-- O King! Hearing thus the Grandsire\xc2\x92s wards, S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha got up\nfrom their meditation; concentrating their attention towards Him,\ncircumambulated Him and bowed down to Him with their hearts full of reverence.\nThe two Asuras were very weak, lean and thin by their hard tapasya and they\nlooked very humble. They fell down before Him like a piece of wood and began\nto speak in a sweet voice, choked by intense feelings. O Brahma _n_! O Deva of\nthe Devas! O Thou, the Ocean of Mercy! O Destroyer of fear of the devotees! O\nLord! If Thou art pleased then dost Thou grant us immortality. There is\nnothing in this world more fearful than death; we two have taken refuge unto\nThee, being afraid of this death. O Thou, Ocean of mercy! O Creator of the\nworld! O Lord of the Devas! O Universal Soul! Protect us from this fear due to\nthe terrible Death.\n\n\n\n21-23. Brahma said :-- Is this the boon that you ask? This is in every way,\nagainst the Law of Nature; for no one, in these three Lokas, can grant this\nboon to anybody. When one becomes born, one must die; and when one dies, one\nmust be born again. This Law is ordained in this world by the Supreme Creator\nof this Universe, from time immemorial. Therefore all the beings must die;\nthere is no doubt in this. Better ask any other boon that you desire; I will\ngrant that to you.\n\n\n\np. 427\n\n\n\n24-27. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the words of Brahma, the two\nDanavas pondered over the matter and bowed down to the Prajapati, the Lord of\nthe Creation and said :-- O Merciful One! Grant us then so that we shall be\ninvulnerable to any of the male of the Immortal Devas down to human beings and\nbirds and deers; this is the boon that we ask. Where exists the woman so\npowerful as to kill us? We never fear any woman in all the three Lokas. O\nLotus-born! We, the two brothers, want not to be killed by any male; the\nfemales are naturally weak therefore we need not fear them.\n\n\n\n28-58. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing their words, the Grandsire Brahma gladly\ngranted them their desired boon and returned to His own abode. On Brahma going\naway, the two Danavas, too, returned to their own places. They then appointed\nthe Muni Bhrigu as their priest and began to worship him. Bhrigu, the best of\nthe Munis, then, on an auspicious day and when the star was benign, got a\nbeautiful golden throne built and gave it to the king. S\xc2\x92umbha, being the\neldest, was then installed on the auspicious throne as the king; the other\nbrave and excellent demons began to assemble there quickly for serving him.\nThe two great warriors Cha _nd_ a and Mu _nd_ a, proud on account of their\ngreat strength came there with their large armies, chariots, horses, and\nelephants. Similarly the valiant warriors Dhumralochana, hearing that S\xc2\x92umbha\nhad become their King, came there with his own army. There came up also at\nthat time the great warrior Rakta Vija, more powerful on account of his\ngetting a boon, attended by his army of two Ak _s_ auhi _n_ i soldiers. O\nKing! Hear why this Rakta Vija became so very unconquerable; whenever this\nAsura was wounded by any weapon, if one drop of blood fell on the ground, at\nonce would be created so many innumerable Asuras, resembling his wicked nature\nand with similar weapons in their hands. The Asuras born of this blood would\nhave similar appearances and would be similar in strength and ready to fight\nat once when they were born. That great warrior, the great Demon Rakta Vija\nwas unconquerable in battle for this very reason and no being could now kill\nhim. The other Asuras, when they heard that S\xc2\x92umbha had become their king,\ncame up there with their armies consisting of four divisions of elephants,\nchariots, cavalry and infantry and began to serve him. The army of S\xc2\x92umbha and\nNis\xc2\x92umbha thus became countless; and they forcibly conquered and got\npossession of all the kingdoms that existed then on the surface of the earth.\nThen Nis\xc2\x92umbha, the destroyer of enemies, collected his army and marched up to\nthe Heavens without any delay to conquer Indra, the Lord of S\xc2\x92achi. He fought\nvery hard with all the Lokapalas on all sides when Indra struck him on his\nbreast with His thunderbolt. Nis\xc2\x92umbha fell unconscious\n\n\n\np. 428\n\n\n\non the ground with that blow when his soldiers, defeated in the battle, fled\naway on all sides. S\xc2\x92umbha, the destroyer of the enemies\xc2\x92 forces, hearing the\nunconscious state of the younger brother, came up at once on the field and\nshot at the Devas with multitudes of arrows. The untiring S\xc2\x92umbha fought so\nviolently that Indra and the other Devas and Lokap _a_ las were defeated.\nS\xc2\x92umbha then took away, perforce, the position of Indra and he occupied the\nCelestial Tree and Heavenly milching cow that yielded all desires and other\nexcellent things over which Indra used to reign. In fact, that high-souled\nAsura got the dominion of the three Lokas and took away all those that were\noffered at the sacrifices. He became highly glad on getting the Nandana Garden\nand was extremely delighted when he drank the celestial nectar. He then\ndefeated in battle Kuvera, the god of wealth and occupied his kingdom. He\ndefeated the Moon, Sun, and Yama, the God of Death and occupied their\npositions. Surrounded by his army, Nis\xc2\x92umbha dispossessed Varu _n_ a, Fire,\nand Air of their kingdoms and began to reign in their stead. Thus deprived of\ntheir kingdoms, prosperity and wealth, the Devas left the Nandana Garden and\nfled, out of terror, to the caves of hills and mountains. Thus deprived of all\ntheir rights, the Devas without any weapons, without any lustre, without any\nhome, and without anywhere to go, began to wander in lonely forests. O King!\nAll the Immortals began to knock about in lonely gardens, mountain caves and\nrivers; and nowhere they found happiness; for happiness depends entirely unto\nthe hands of Fate. O Lord of men! Even those fortunate souls, who are\npowerful, and wealthy and wise, meet at times with distress and poverty. O\nKing! How marvellous are the ways and manners of Time! It makes kings and\ndonors beggars; it renders the powerful, weak; literates, illiterates; and it\nmakes great warriors into terrible cowards. O King! Vasava performed one\nhundred horse-sacrifices and got the excellent Indra\xc2\x92s position; but again be\nfell into extreme difficulties; thus runs the wheel of Time.\n\n\n\n59\\. It is Time that bestows the gem of knowledge to a person and it is Time\nagain that deprives that very same man of his wisdom and makes him a great\nsinner.\n\n\n\n60-61. The Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u takes incarnations, under the control of Time,\nin several lower wombs as boar, etc., and Maha Deva carries on His body the\nhuman skulls, that are not even fit to be touched. When Brahma, Vi _sn_ u,\nMahes\xc2\x92a and others suffer such painful things, then one need not wonder at the\nworkings of the Great inscrutable Time.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-first Chapter of the Fifth Book on the conquest of the\nHeavens by S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura\n_n_ am of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 22](bk05ch22.htm)\n\n'
