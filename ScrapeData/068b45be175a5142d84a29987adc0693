The Rice Ordeal.\n\n* 337. 337 Now I will proclaim the rule regarding the grains of rice which have to be chewed (by the defendant). This rice ordeal should be administered in cases of larceny, but on no other occasion whatsoever. That is the law.\n\n* 338. Let the judge, who must have cleansed himself previously, use white grains of rice, but not (the grains) of any other fruit, and let him place them in an earthen vessel in the sight of (an image of the deity of) the sun.\n\n339. 339 After having mixed them with water in which (an image of the sun-god) has been bathed, he shall leave them in that place for a night. At daybreak, after having prepared them three times, a worshipper of the gods shall give them himself\n\n340\\. (To the defendant), who must be facing the east and must have bathed and\nfasted, after having proclaimed the charge himself, in order that right may be\ndiscerned from wrong.\n\np. 119\n\n* 341. When the defendant has chewed the grains, he shall cause him to spit them on a leaf. If a leaf of the holy fig-tree be not available, he shall take a leaf of the birch-tree (for that purpose).\n\n* 342. Should blood issue forth, or the tooth-flesh be hurt, or the limbs shake, he must be pronounced guilty.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[118:337](sbe3332.htm#fr_339) 337-342. The rice ordeal consists of chewing a\nnumber of grains of rice in the husk. If the tooth-flesh is hurt and if blood\nissues forth, or if the man is seen to be trembling during the proceeding, it\nis viewed as a proof of guilt. Otherwise he is acquitted.\n\n[118:339](sbe3332.htm#fr_340) Should the reading be tri _h_ k _ri_ tva _h_ ,\n'(he shall give them) thrice?'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 26.
