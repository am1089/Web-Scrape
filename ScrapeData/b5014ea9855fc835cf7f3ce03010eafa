Ether! Sky!  \nLike heaven in plenty and like earth in compass! Upon thy  \nback, Earth, place of sacrificing to Gods, for gain of food  \nI lay food-eating Agni.  \n6 This spotted Bull hath come and sat before the Mother and  \nbefore  \nThe Father, mounting up to heaven.\n\np. 18\n\n7 As expiration from his breath his radiance penetrates within:  \nThe Bull shines out through all the sky.  \n8 He rules supreme through thirty realms. Song is bestowed  \nupon the Bird  \nThroughout the days at break of morn.  \n9 Agni is light, and light is Agni. Hail!  \nSurya is light, and light is Surya. Hail!  \nAgni is splendour, light is splendour. Hail!  \nSurya is splendour, light is splendour. Hail!  \nLight is Surya, Surya is light. Hail!  \n10 Accordant with bright Savitar and Night with Indra at her  \nside,  \nMay Agni, being pleased, enjoy. All-hail!  \n11 Approaching sacrifice, may we pronounce a text to Agni  \nwho  \nHeareth us even when afar.  \n12 Agni is head and height of heaven, the Master of the earth  \nis he:  \nHe quickeneth the waters\xc2\x92 seed.  \n13 You two will I invoke, O Indra-Agni, will please you both  \ntogether with oblation.  \nGivers, you twain, of vigorous strength and riches, you  \ntwain do I invoke for gain of vigour.  \n14 This is thine ordered place of birth whence, sprung to life,  \nthou shonest forth.  \nKnowing this, Agni, rise thou up and cause our riches to  \nincrease.  \n15 Here by ordainers was this God appointed first Invoker,  \nbest at worship, to be praised at rites,  \nWhom Apnavana and the Bhrigus caused to shine, bright-coloured  \nin the wood, spreading to every house.\n\np. 19\n\n16 After his ancient splendour they, the bold, have drawn the  \nbright milk from  \nThe Sage who wins a thousand gifts.  \n17 Thou, Agni, art our bodies\xc2\x92 guard. Guard thou my body.  \nGiver of life art thou, O Agni. Give me life.  \nGiver of splendour art thou, Agni. Give me splendour.  \nAll that is wanting in my body, Agni, supply for me.  \n18 Enkindled we enkindle thee through hundred winters, thee  \nthe bright;  \nWe healthy, thee who givest health; we strong, thee author  \nof our strength;  \nWe, never injured, Agni, thee uninjured injurer of foes.  \nO rich in shining lights, may I in safety rich the end of thee.  \n19 Thou hast attained, O Agni, to the splendour of Surya, to  \nthe eulogy of Rishis, and to the habitation which thou  \nlovest.  \nMay I attain to lengthened life, to splendour, to offspring  \nand abundant store of riches.  \n20 Ye are food, may I enjoy your food. Ye are might, may I  \nenjoy your might. Ye are energy, may I enjoy your  \nenergy. Ye are abundant riches, may I enjoy your abundant  \nriches.  \n21 Sport, wealthy ones, in this abode, this fold, this spot, this  \ndwelling-place.  \nRemain just here, and go not hence.  \n22 Composed art thou of every form and colour. With sap and.  \nownership of kine approach me.  \nTo thee, dispeller of the night, O Agni, day by day with  \nprayer,  \nBringing thee reverence, we come;\n\np. 20\n\n23 Ruler of sacrifices, guard of Law eternal, radiant One,  \nIncreasing in thine own abode.  \n24 Be to us easy of approach, even as a father to his son:  \nAgni, be with us for our weal.  \n25 O Agni, be our nearest Friend; be thou a kind deliverer  \nand gracious Friend.  \nExcellent Agni, come thou nigh to us, and give us wealth  \nmost splendidly renowned.  \n26 To thee then, O most bright, O radiant God, we come with  \nprayer for happiness for our friends.  \nSo hear us, listen to this call of ours, and keep us far from  \nevery evil man.  \n27 O Ida, come, O Aditi, come hither. Come hither, much-desired!  \nFrom you may I obtain my heart's desire.  \n28 O Brahmanaspati, make him who presses Soma glorious,  \nEven Kakshivan Ausija.  \n29 The rich, the healer of disease, who findeth wealth, increaseth  \nstore,  \nThe prompt,\xc2\x97may he be with us still.  \n30 Let not the foeman's curse, let not a mortal's treachery fall  \non us:  \nPreserve us, Brahmanaspati!  \n31 Great, heavenly, unassailable, ours be the favour of the Three,  \nAryaman, Mitra, Varuna.  \n32 For over them, neither at home nor upon pathways perilous,  \nThe evil-minded foe hath power.  \n33 For they, the Sons of Aditi, bestow eternal light upon  \nA mortal man that he may live.\n\np. 21\n\n34 Ne\xc2\x92er art thou fruitless, Indra, ne\xc2\x92er dost thou forsake thy  \nworshipper.  \nBut now. O Liberal Lord, thy bounty as a God is ever poured  \nforth more and more.  \n35 May we attain that excellent glory of Savitar the God:  \nSo may he stimulate our prayers.  \n36 May thine inviolable car wherewith thou guardest worshippers  \nCome near to us from every side.  \n37 Earth! Ether! Sky! May I be rich in offspring, well-manned  \nwith men and opulent with riches. Friendly to men!  \ndo thou protect my offspring. Worthy of praise! do thou  \nprotect my cattle.  \nO pointed One, protect the food that feeds me.  \n38 We have approached the Omniscient, best finder-out of  \nwealth for us. Splendour and strength bestow on us,  \nO Agni, thou Imperial Lord.  \n39 Lord of the Home, this Agni Garhapatya is best at finding  \nriches for our children.  \nSplendour and strength bestow on us, O Agni, Master of the  \nHome.  \n40 Rich, furtherer of plenty is this Agni, Master-of the Herd.  \nSplendour and strength bestow on us, O Agni, Master of  \nthe Herd.  \n41 Fear not, nor tremble thou, O House. To thee who bearest  \nstrength we come.\n\np. 22\n\nI, bearing strength, intelligent and happy, come to thee,  \nHouse, rejoicing in my spirit.  \n42 The home on which the wanderer thinks, where cheerfulness  \nand joy abound  \nWe call the Home to welcome us. May it know us who  \nknow it well.  \n43 Here have the cows been called to us, the goats and sheep  \nhave been called near,  \nAnd in our home we have addressed the meath that sweeteneth  \nour food.  \nI come to thee for safety and for quiet. May joy be ours,  \nfelicity, and blessing.  \n44 We invocate the Maruts, the voracious, eaters of their foes,  \nDelighting in their mess of meal.  \n45 We expiate by sacrifice each sinful act that we have done,  \nWhether in village or the wild, in company or corporeal  \nsense. Svaha!  \n46 Let us not here contend with Gods, O Indra, for, Fierce  \nOne! here is thine own sacred portion,  \nThine, Mighty One, whose friends, the bounteous Maruts,  \nhis song who pours oblation, streamlike, honours.  \n47 The skilful workers have performed their work with voice  \nthat gives delight.  \nHaving performed the work for Gods, go, ye companions, to  \nyour home.  \n48 O ever-moving Cleansing Bath, thou movest gliding on thy  \nway.\n\np. 23\n\nWith Gods may I wash out the sin that I have sinned  \nagainst the Gods, with men the sin against mankind.  \nPreserve me safe from injury, O God, from him who loudly  \nroars.  \n49 Full, fly away, O spoon, and filled completely fly thou back  \nto us.  \nO Satakratu, let us twain barter, like goods, our food and  \nstrength.  \n50 Give me, I give thee gifts: bestow on me, and I bestow on  \nthee.  \nTo me present thy merchandize, and I to thee will give my  \nwares.  \n51 Well have they eaten and regaled: the friends have risen  \nand passed away.  \nThe sages, luminous in themselves, have praised thee with  \ntheir latest hymn.  \nNow, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.  \n52 Thee will we reverence, thee, O Lord of Bounty, who art  \nfair to see.  \nThus praised, according to our wish come now with richly-laden  \ncar. Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.  \n53 We call the spirit hither with a hero-celebrating strain,  \nYea, with the Fathers\xc2\x92 holy hymns.  \n54 The spirit comes to us again for wisdom, energy, and life,  \nThat we may long behold the Sun.  \n55 O Fathers, may the Heavenly Folk give us the spirit once  \nagain,  \nThat we may be with those who live.\n\np. 24\n\n56 O Soma, with the spirit still within us, blest with progeny,  \nMay we be busied in thy law.  \n57 O Rudra, this is thine allotted portion. With Ambika thy  \nsister kindly take it. This, Rudra, is thy share, the rat  \nthy victim.  \n58 We have contented Rudra, yea, put off Tryambaka the God,  \nThat he may make us wealthier, may make us yet more  \nprosperous, may make us vigorous to act.  \n59 Thou art a healing medicine, a balm for cow and horse and  \nman, a happiness to ram and ewe.  \n60 Tryambaka we worship, sweet augmenter of prosperity.  \nAs from its stem a cucumber, may I be freed from bonds of  \ndeath, not reft of immortality.  \nWe worship him, Tryambaka, the husband-finder, sweet to  \nsmell.  \nAs from its stem a cucumber, hence and not thence may I  \nbe loosed.  \n61 This, Rudra, is thy food: with this depart beyond the  \nMujavans.  \nWith bow unstrung, with [muffled](errata.htm#1) staff, clothed in a garment  \nmade of skin, gracious, not harming us, depart.  \n62 May Jamadagni's triple life, the triple life of Kasyapa,  \nThe triple life of Deities\xc2\x97may that same triple life be ours.\n\np. 25\n\n63 Gracious, thy name; the thunder is thy father. Obeisance  \nbe to thee: forbear to harm me.  \nI shave thee for long life, for food to feed thee, for progeny,  \nfor riches in abundance, for noble children, for heroic  \nvigour.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book IV](wyvbk04.htm)\n\n"
