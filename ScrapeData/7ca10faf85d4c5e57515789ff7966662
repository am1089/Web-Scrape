If-one of them is\ncontrolled, then both are controlled. Of these two, a person should control\n(pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a) v\xc4\x81yu always through moderate food, postures, and thirdly \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi-ch\xc4\x81la.\n3 I shall explain the nature of these. Listen to it, O Gau\xe1\xb9\xadama. One should\ntake a sweet and nutritious food, 4 leaving a fourth (of his stomach)\nunfilled) in order to please \xc5\x9aiva (the patron of yogins). This is called\nmoderate food. Posture herein required is of two kinds, pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma and vajra.\nPlacing the two heels over the two opposite thighs (respectively) is the pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma\n(posture) which is the destroyer of all sins. Placing one heel below the\nm\xc5\xablakan\xe1\xb8\x8da 5 and the other over it and sitting with the neck, body and head\nerect is the vajra posture. The \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi (mentioned above) is only kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab. A\nwise man should take it up from its place ( _viz_., the navel, upwards) to the\nmiddle of the eyebrows. This is called \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi-ch\xc4\x81la. In practising it, two\nthings are necessary,\n\np. 261\n\n[paragraph continues] Sarasvat\xc4\xabch\xc4\x81lana 1 and the restraint of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a (breath).\nThen through practice, kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab (which is spiral) becomes straightened. Of\nthese two, I shall explain to you first Sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab-ch\xc4\x81la\xe1\xb9\x87a. It is said by the\nwise of old that Sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab is no other than Arun\xe1\xb8\x8dha\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab. 2 It is only by rousing\nher up that kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab is roused. When pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a (breath) is passing through\n(one\'s) Id\xc4\x81 (left nostril), he should assume firmly pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma-posture and should\nlengthen (inwards) 4 digits the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b of 12 digits. 3 Then the wise man should\nbind the (sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab) n\xc4\x81di by means of this lengthened (breath) and holding\nfirmly together(both his ribs near the navel) by means of the forefingers and\nthumbs of both hands, (one hand on each side) should stir up kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab with\nall his might from right to left often and often; for a period of two muh\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\xadas\n(48 minutes), he should be stirring it up fearlessly. Then he should draw up a\nlittle when kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab enters sushumn\xc4\x81. By this means, kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab enters the\nmouth of sushumn\xc4\x81. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a (also) having left (that place) enters of itself the\nsushumn\xc4\x81 (along with kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab). By compressing the neck, one should also\nexpand the navel. Then by shaking sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab, pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a goes above (to) the chest.\nThrough the contraction of the neck, prays, goes above from the chest.\nSarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab who has sound in her womb should be shaken (or thrown into\nvibration) each day. Therefore by merely shaking it, one is cured of diseases.\nGulma (a splenetic disease), jalo\xe1\xb8\x8dara (dropsy), pl\xc4\xabha (a splenetic disease)\nand all other diseases arising within the belly, are undoubtedly destroyed by\nshaking this \xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi.\n\nI shall now briefly describe to you pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a is the v\xc4\x81yu that moves in\nthe body and its restraint within is known as kumbhaka. It is of two kinds,\nsahi\xe1\xb9\xada and kevala. 4 One should practise sahi\xe1\xb9\xada till he gets kevala. There are\nfour bhe\xe1\xb8\x8das (lit., piercings or divisions) _viz_., s\xc5\xabrya, ujj\xc4\x81y\xc4\xab, \xc5\x9bi\xe1\xb9\xadal\xc4\xab, and\nbhas\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab.\n\np. 262\n\n[paragraph continues] The kumbhaka associated with these four is called sahi\xe1\xb9\xada\nkumbhaka.\n\nBeing seated in the pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma posture upon a pure and pleasant seat which gives\nease and is neither too high nor too low, and in a place which is pure, lovely\nand free from pebbles, etc., and which for the length of a bow is free from\ncold, fire, and water, one should shake (or throw into vibration) Sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab;\nslowly inhaling the breath from outside, as long as he desires, through the\nright nostril, he should exhale it through the left nostril. He should exhale\nit after purifying his skull (by forcing the breath up). This destroys the\nfour kinds of evils caused by v\xc4\x81yu as also by intestinal worms. This should be\ndone often and it is this which is spoken of as s\xc5\xabryabhe\xe1\xb8\x8da.\n\nClosing the mouth and drawing up slowly the breath as before with the nose\nthrough both the n\xc4\x81dis (or nostrils) and retaining it in the space between the\nheart and the neck, one should exhale it through the left nostril. This\ndestroys the heat caused in the head as well as the phlegm in the throat. It\nremoves all diseases, purifies his body and increases the (gastric) fire\nwithin. It removes also the evils arising in the n\xc4\x81dis, jalo\xe1\xb8\x8dara (water-belly\nor dropsy) and \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadus. This kumbhaka is called ujj\xc4\x81y\xc4\xab and may be practised\n(even) when walking or standing.\n\nDrawing up the breath as before through the tongue with (the hissing sound of)\n\xe0\xa4\xb8 and retaining it as before, the wise man should slowly exhale it through\n(both) the nostrils. This is called \xc5\x9b\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xadal\xc4\xab kumbhaka and destroys diseases,\nsuch as gulma, pl\xc4\xabha, consumption, bile, fever, thirst, and poison.\n\nSeated in the pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma posture with belly and neck erect, the wise man should\nclose the mouth and exhale with care through the nostrils. Then he should\ninhale a little with speed up to the heart, so that the breath may fill the\nspace with noise between the neck and skull. Then he should exhale in the same\nway and inhale often and often. Just as the bellows of a smith are moved (\n_viz_., stuffed with air within and then the air is let out), so he should\nmove the air within his body. If the body gets tired, then he should inhale\nthrough the right nostril. If his belly is full of v\xc4\x81yu, then he should press\nwell his nostrils with\n\np. 263\n\nall his fingers except his forefinger, and performing kumbhaka as before,\nshould exhale through the left nostril. This frees one from diseases of fire\nin (or inflammation of) the throat, increases the gastric fire within, enables\none to know the kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab, produces purity removing sins, gives happiness and\npleasure and destroys phlegm which is the bolt (or obstacle) to the door at\nthe mouth of brahman\xc4\x81di ( _viz_., sushumn\xc4\x81). It pierces also the three\ngran\xe1\xb9\xadhis 1 (or knots) differentiated through the three gu\xe1\xb9\x87as. This kumbhaka is\nknown as bhas\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab and should especially be performed.\n\nThrough these four ways when kumbhaka is near (or is about to be performed.),\nthe sinless yogin should practise the three bandhas. 2 The first is called\nm\xc5\xablaban\xe1\xb8\x8dha. The second is called uddiy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, and the third is j\xc4\x81lan\xe1\xb8\x8dhara. Their\nnature will be thus described. Ap\xc4\x81na (breath) which has a downward tendency is\nforced up by one bending down. This process is called m\xc5\xablaban\xe1\xb8\x8dha. When ap\xc4\x81na\nis raised up and reaches the sphere of agni (fire), then the flame of agni\ngrows long, being blown about by v\xc4\x81yu. Then agni and ap\xc4\x81na come to (or\ncommingle with) pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a in a heated state. Through this agni which is very\nfiery, there arises in the body the flaming (or the fire) which rouses the\nsleeping kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab through its heat. Then this kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab makes a hissing\nnoise, becomes erect like a serpent beaten with stick and enters the hole of\nbrahman\xc4\x81di (sushumn\xc4\x81). Therefore yogins should daily practise m\xc5\xablaban\xe1\xb8\x8dha\noften. Uddiy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a should be performed at the end of kumbhaka and at the\nbeginning of expiration. Because pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a udd\xc4\xabya\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x93 ( _viz_., goes up) the\nsushumn\xc4\x81 in this ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha, therefore it called uddiy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a by the yogins. Being\nseated in the vajra posture, and holding firmly the two toes by the two hands,\nhe should press at the kan\xe1\xb8\x8da and at the place near the two ankles. Then he\nshould gradually upbear the \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81na 3 (thread or n\xc4\x81di) which is on the western\nside first to u\xe1\xb8\x8dara (the upper part of the abdomen above the navel), then to\nthe heart and then to the neck. When pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a reaches the san\xe1\xb8\x8dhi (junction) of\nnavel, slowly it removes\n\np. 264\n\nthe impurities (or diseases) in the navel. Therefore this should be frequently\npractised. The ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha called j\xc4\x81lan\xe1\xb8\x8dhara should be practised at the end of\nkumbhaka. This j\xc4\x81lan\xe1\xb8\x8dhara is of the form of the contraction of the neck and is\nan impediment to the passage of v\xc4\x81yu (upwards). When the neck is contracted at\nonce by bending downwards (so that the chin may touch the breast), pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a goes\nthrough brahman\xc4\x81di on the western \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81na in the middle. Assuming the seat as\nmentioned before, one should stir up sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab and control pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. On the first\nday kumbhaka should be done four times; on the second day it should be done\nten times, and then five times separately; on the third day, twenty times will\ndo, and afterwards kumbhaka should be performed with the three ban\xe1\xb8\x8dhas and\nwith an increase of five times each day.\n\nDiseases are generated in one\'s body through the following causes, _viz_.,\nsleeping in daytime, late vigils over night, excess of sexual intercourse,\nmoving in crowd, the checking of the discharge of urine and faeces, the evil\nof unwholesome food and laborious mental operation with pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. If a yogin is\nafraid of such diseases (when attacked by them), he says, "my diseases have\narisen from my practice of yoga." Then he will discontinue this practice. This\nis said to be the first obstacle to yoga The second (obstacle) is doubt; the\nthird is carelessness; the fourth, laziness; the fifth, sleep; the sixth, the\nnot leaving of objects (of sense); the seventh, erroneous perception; the\neighth, sensual objects; the ninth, want of faith; 1 and the tenth, the\nfailure to attain the truth of yoga. A wise man should abandon these ten\nobstacles after great deliberation. The practice of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma should be\nperformed daily with the mind firmly fixed on Truth. Then chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada is absorbed\nin sushumn\xc4\x81, and pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a (therefore) never moves. When the impurities (of\nchi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada) are thus removed and pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a is absorbed in sushumn\xc4\x81, he becomes a\n(true) yogin. Ap\xc4\x81na, which has a downward tendency should be raised up with\neffort by the contraction (of the anus), and this is spoken of as m\xc5\xablaban\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81.\nAp\xc4\x81na thus raised up mixes with agni and\n\np. 265\n\nthen they go up quickly to the seat of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. Then pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and ap\xc4\x81na uniting\nwith one another go to kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab, which is coiled up and asleep. Ku\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab\nbeing heated by agni and stirred up by v\xc4\x81yu, extends her body in the mouth of\nsushumn\xc4\x81, pierces the brahmagran\xe1\xb9\xadhi formed of rajas, and flashes at once like\nlightning at the mouth of sushumn\xc4\x81. Then it goes up at once through\nvish\xe1\xb9\x87\xc5\xabgran\xe1\xb9\xadhi to the heart. Then it goes up through ru\xe1\xb8\x8dragran\xe1\xb9\xadhi and above it\nto the middle of the eyebrows; having pierced this place, it goes up to the\nma\xe1\xb9\x87dala (sphere) of the moon. It dries up the moisture produced by the moon in\nthe an\xc4\x81ha\xe1\xb9\xadachakra having sixteen petals. 1 When the blood is agitated through\nthe speed of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, it becomes bile from its contact with the sun, after which\nit goes to the sphere of the moon where it becomes of the nature of the flow\nof pure phlegm. How does it (blood) which is very cold become hot when it\nflows there? (Since) at the same time the intense white form of moon is\nspeedily heated. 2 Then being agitated, it goes up. Through taking in this,\nchi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada which was moving amidst sensual objects externally, is restrained\nthere. The novice enjoying this high state attains peace and becomes devoted\nto \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Ku\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab assumes the eight 3 forms of prak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi (matter) and attains\n\xc5\x9aiva by encircling him and dissolves itself in \xc5\x9aiva. Thus rajas-\xc5\x9bukla 4\n(seminal fluid) which rises up goes to \xc5\x9aiva along with maru\xe1\xb9\xad (v\xc4\x81yu); pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and\nap\xc4\x81na which are always produced become equal. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as flow in all things, great\nand small, describable or indescribable, as fire in gold. Then this body which\nis \xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhibhau\xe1\xb9\xadika (composed of elements) becomes \xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi\xe1\xb8\x8daiva\xe1\xb9\xada (relating to a\ntutelar deity) and is thus purified. Then it attains the stage of a\xe1\xb9\xadiv\xc4\x81hika. 5\nThen the body being freed from the inert state\n\np. 266\n\nbecomes stainless and of the nature of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad. In it, the a\xe1\xb9\xadiv\xc4\x81hika becomes the\nchief of all, being of the nature of That. Like the conception of the snake in\na rope, so the idea of the release from wife and sams\xc4\x81ra is the delusion of\ntime. Whatever appears is unreal. Whatever is absorbed is unreal. Like the\nillusory conception of silver in the mother-of-pearl, so is the idea of man\nand woman. The microcosm and the macrocosm are one and the same; so also the\nli\xe1\xb9\x85ga and s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma, svabh\xc4\x81va (substance) and form and the self-resplendent\nlight and Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.\n\nThe \xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi named kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab, which is like a thread in the lotus and is\nresplendent, is biting with the upper end of its hood (namely, mouth) at the\nroot of the lotus the m\xc5\xablakan\xe1\xb8\x8da. Taking hold of its tail with its mouth, it is\nin contact with the hole of brahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra (of sushumn\xc4\x81). If a person seated in\nthe pad ma posture and having accustomed himself to the contraction of his\nanus makes his v\xc4\x81yu go upward with the mind intent on kumbhaka, then agni\ncomes to sv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhishth\xc4\x81na flaming, owing to the blowing of v\xc4\x81yu. From the blowing\nof v\xc4\x81yu and agni, the chief (kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab) pierces open the brahmagran\xe1\xb9\xadhi and\nthen vish\xe1\xb9\x87ugran\xe1\xb9\xadhi. Then it pierces ru\xe1\xb8\x8dragran\xe1\xb9\xadhi, after that, (all) the six\nlotuses (or plexuses). Then \xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi is happy with \xc5\x9aiva in sahasr\xc4\x81ra kamala\n(1,000 lotuses\' seat or pineal gland). This should be known as the highest\navas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81 (state) and it alone is the giver of final beatitude. Thus ends the\nfirst chapter.\n\n##### Chapter II\n\nI shall hereafter describe the science called khechar\xc4\xab which is such that one\nwho knows it is freed from old age and death in this world. One who is subject\nto the pains of death, disease and old age should, O sage, on knowing this\nscience make his mind firm and practise khechar\xc4\xab. One should regard that\nperson as his guru on earth who knows khechar\xc4\xab, the destroyer of old age and\ndeath, both from knowing the meaning of books and practice, and should perform\nit with all his heart. The science of khechar\xc4\xab is not easily attainable, as\nalso its practice.\n\np. 267\n\n[paragraph continues] Its practice and melana 1 are not accomplished\nsimultaneously. Those that are bent upon practice alone do not get melana.\nOnly some get the practice, O Brahman, after several births, but melana is not\nobtained even after a hundred births. Having undergone the practice after\nseveral births, some (solitary) yogin gets the melana in some future birth as\nthe result of his practice. When a yogin gets this melana from the mouth of\nhis guru, then he obtains the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis mentioned in the several books. When a\nman gets this melana through books and the significance, then he attains the\nstate of \xc5\x9aiva freed from all rebirth. Even gurus may not be able to know this\nwithout books. Therefore this science is very difficult to master. An ascetic\nshould wander over the earth so long as he fails to get this science, and when\nthis science is obtained, then he has got the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi in his hand ( _viz_.,\nmastered the psychical powers). Therefore one should regard as Achyu\xe1\xb9\xada\n(Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u) the person who imparts the melana, as also him who gives out the\nscience. He should regard as \xc5\x9aiva him who teaches the practice. Having got\nthis science from me, you should not reveal it to others. Therefore one who\nknows this should protect it with all his efforts ( _viz_., should never give\nit out except to persons who deserve it). O Brahman, one should go to the\nplace where lives the guru, who is able to teach the divine yoga and there\nlearn from him the science khechar\xc4\xab, and being then taught well by him, should\nat first practise it carefully. By means of this science, a person will attain\nthe si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi of khechar\xc4\xab. Joining with khechar\xc4\xab \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi ( _viz_., kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi)\nby means of the (science) of khechar\xc4\xab which contains the b\xc4\xabja (seed of letter)\nof khechar\xc4\xab, one becomes the lord of khecharas (\xe1\xb8\x8cevas) and lives always\namongst them. Khechar\xc4\xab b\xc4\xabja (seed-letter) is spoken of as agni encircled with\nwater and as the abode of khecharas (\xe1\xb8\x8cevas). Through this yoga, si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is\nmastered. The ninth (b\xc4\xabja) letter of som\xc4\x81m\xc5\x9ba (soma or moon part) should also\nbe pronounced in the reverse order. Then a letter composed of three am\xc5\x9bas of\nthe form of moon has been described; and after that, the eighth letter should\nbe pronounced in\n\np. 268\n\nthe reverse order; then consider it as the supreme and its beginning as the\nfifth, and this is said to the k\xc5\xabta (horns) of the several bhinnas (or parts)\nof the moon. 1 This which tends to the accomplishment of all yogas, should be\nlearnt through the initiation of a guru. He who recites this twelve times\nevery day, will not get even in sleep that m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 (illusion) which is born in\nhis body and which is the source of all vicious deeds. He who recites this\nfive lakhs of times with very great care--to him the science of khechar\xc4\xab will\nreveal itself. All obstacles vanish and the \xe1\xb8\x8devas are pleased. The destruction\nof val\xc4\xabpali\xe1\xb9\xada ( _viz_., wrinkle and greyness of hair) will take place without\ndoubt. Having acquired this great science, one should practise it afterwards.\nIf not, O Brahman, he will suffer without getting any si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi in the path of\nkhechar\xc4\xab. If one does not get this nectarlike science in this practice, he\nshould get it in the beginning of melana and recite it always; (else) one who\nis without it never gets si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. As soon as he gets this science, he should\npractise it; and then the sage will soon get the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. Having drawn out the\ntongue from the root of the palate, a knower of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 should clear the impurity\n(of the tongue) for seven days according to the advice of his guru. He should\ntake a sharp knife which is oiled and cleaned and which resembles the leaf of\nthe plant snuh\xc4\xab ("Euphorbia antiquorum") and should cut for the space of a\nhair (the fraenum Lingui). Having powdered sain\xe1\xb8\x8dhava (rock-salt) and pa\xe1\xb9\xadhya\n(sea-salt), he should apply it to the place. On the seventh day, he should\nagain cut for the space of a hair. Thus for the space of six months, he should\ncontinue it always gradually with great care. In six months, \xc5\x9airo-ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha\n(ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha at the head), 1 which is at the root of the tongue is destroyed. Then\nthe yogin who knows timely action should encircle with \xc5\x9airo-vas\xe1\xb9\xadra (lit., the\ncloth of the head) the V\xc4\x81k-\xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvar\xc4\xab (the deity presiding over speech) and should\ndraw (it) up. Again by daily drawing it up for six months, it comes, O sage,\nas far as the middle of the eyebrows and obliquely up to the opening of the\nears; having gradually practised, it goes to the root of the chin. Then in\n\np. 269\n\nthree years, it goes up easily to the end of the hair (of the head) It goes up\nobliquely to \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81kha 1 and downwards to the well of the throat. In another three\nyears, it occupies brahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra and stops there without doubt. Crosswise it\ngoes up to the top of the head and downwards to the well of the throat.\nGradually it opens the great adamantine door in the head. The rare science (of\nkhechar\xc4\xab) b\xc4\xabja has been explained before. One should perform the six a\xe1\xb9\x85gas\n(parts) of this man\xe1\xb9\xadra by pronouncing it in six different intonations. One\nshould do this in order to attain all the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis; and this karany\xc4\x81sam 2\nshould be done gradually and not all at a time, since the body of one who does\nit all at once will soon decay. Therefore it should be practised, O best of\nsages, little by little. When the tongue goes to the brahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra through the\nouter path, then one should place the tongue after moving the bolt of Brahma\nwhich cannot be mastered by the \xe1\xb8\x8devas. On doing this for three years with the\npoint of the finger, he should make the tongue enter within: then it enters\nbrahma\xe1\xb8\x8dv\xc4\x81ra (or hole). On entering the brahma\xe1\xb8\x8dv\xc4\x81ra, one should practise\nma\xe1\xb9\xadhana (churning) well. Some intelligent men attain si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi even without\nma\xe1\xb9\xadhana. One who is versed in khechar\xc4\xab man\xe1\xb9\xadra accomplishes it without ma\xe1\xb9\xadhana.\nBy doing the japa and ma\xe1\xb9\xadhana, one reaps the fruits soon. By connecting a wire\nmade of gold, silver or iron with the nostrils by means of a thread soaked in\nmilk, one should restrain his breath in his heart and seated in a convenient\nposture with his eyes concentrated between his eyebrows, he should perform\nma\xe1\xb9\xadhana slowly. In six months, the state of ma\xe1\xb9\xadhana becomes natural like sleep\nin children. And it is not advisable to do ma\xe1\xb9\xadhana always. It should be done\n(once) only in every month. A yogin should not revolve his tongue in the path.\nAfter doing this for twelve years, si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is surely obtained. Then he sees the\nwhole universe in his body as not being different from \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. This path of the\n\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb8\x8dhvaku\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab (higher kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab), O chief of kings, conquers the macrocosm.\nThus ends the second chapter.\n\np. 270\n\n##### Chapter III\n\nMelanaman\xe1\xb9\xadra.--(Hr\xc4\xabm), (bham), (sam), (sham), (pham), (sam), and (ksham).\n\nThe lotus-born (Brahma) said:\n\nO \xc5\x9aa\xe1\xb9\x85kara, (among) new moon (the first day of the lunar fortnight) and full\nmoon, which is spoken of as its (man\xe1\xb9\xadra\'s) sign? In the first day of lunar\nfortnight and during new moon and full moon (days), it should be made firm and\nthere is no other way (or time). A man longs for an object through passion and\nis infatuated with passion for objects. One should always leave these two and\nseek the Nira\xc3\xb1jana (stainless). He should abandon everything else which he\nthinks is favourable to himself. Keeping the manas in the midst of \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi, and\n\xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi in the midst of manas, one should look into manas by means\n[of](errata.htm#21) manas. Then he leaves even the highest stage. Manas alone\nis the bin\xe1\xb8\x8du, the cause of creation and preservation. It is only through manas\nthat bin\xe1\xb8\x8du is produced, like the curd from milk. The organs of manas is not\nthat which is situated in the middle of ban\xe1\xb8\x8dhana. Ban\xe1\xb8\x8dhana is there where\n\xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi is between the sun and moon. Having known sushumn\xc4\x81 and its bhe\xe1\xb8\x8da\n(piercing) and making the v\xc4\x81yu go in the middle, one should stand in the seat\nof bin\xe1\xb8\x8du, and close the nostrils. Having known v\xc4\x81yu, the above-mentioned bin\xe1\xb8\x8du\nand the sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva-prak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi as well as the six chakras, one should enter the sukha-\nma\xe1\xb9\x87dala ( _viz_., the sahasr\xc4\x81ra or pineal gland, the sphere of happiness).\nThere are six chakras. M\xc5\xabl\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra is in the anus; sv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhishth\xc4\x81na is near the\ngenital organ; ma\xe1\xb9\x87ip\xc5\xabraka is in the navel; an\xc4\x81ha\xe1\xb9\xada is in the heart; vi\xc5\x9bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi\nis at the root of the neck and \xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81 is in the head (between the two eyebrows).\nHaving known these six ma\xe1\xb9\x87dalas (spheres), one should enter the sukhama\xe1\xb9\x87dala\n(pineal gland), drawing up the v\xc4\x81yu and should send it (v\xc4\x81yu) upwards. He who\npractises thus (the control of) v\xc4\x81yu becomes one with brahm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87da (the\nmacrocosm). He should practise (or master) v\xc4\x81yu, bin\xe1\xb8\x8du, chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, and chakra.\n\nYogins attain the nectar of equality through sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi alone. Just as the fire\nlatent in (sacrificial) wood does not\n\np. 271\n\nappear without churning, so the lamp of wisdom does not arise without the\nabhy\xc4\x81sa yoga (or practice of yoga). The fire placed in a vessel does not give\nlight outside. When the vessel is broken, its light appears without. One\'s\nbody is spoken of as the vessel, and the seat of "That" is the fire (or light)\nwithin; and when it (the body) is broken through the words of a guru, the\nlight of brahmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na becomes resplendent. With the guru as the helmsman, one\ncrosses the subtle body and the ocean of sams\xc4\x81ra through the affinities of\npractice. That v\xc4\x81k 1 (power of speech) which sprouts in par\xc4\x81, gives forth two\nleaves in pa\xc5\x9byan\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab, buds forth in ma\xe1\xb8\x8dhyam\xc4\x81 and blossoms in vaikhar\xc4\xab--that v\xc4\x81k\nwhich has before been described, reaches the stage of the absorption of sound,\nreversing the above order ( _viz_., beginning with vaikhar\xc4\xab, etc). Whoever\nthinks that He who is the great lord of that v\xc4\x81k, who is the undifferentiated\nand who is the illuminator of that v\xc4\x81k is Self; whoever thinks over thus, is\nnever affected by words, high or low (or good or bad). The three (aspects 2 of\nconsciousness), vi\xc5\x9bva, \xe1\xb9\xadaijasa, and pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a (in man), the three Virat,\nHira\xe1\xb9\x87yagarbha, and \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara in the universe, the egg of the universe, the egg of\nman 3 and the seven worlds--all these in turn are absorbed in Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma\nthrough the absorption of their respective up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhis (vehicles). The egg being\nheated by the fire of j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is absorbed with its k\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87a (cause) into Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81\n(Universal Self). Then it becomes one with Parabrahman. It is then neither\nsteadiness nor depth, neither light nor darkness, neither describable nor\ndistinguishable. Sa\xe1\xb9\xad (Be-ness) alone remains. One should think of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as\nbeing within the body like a light in a vessel. \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is of the dimensions of a\nthumb, is a light without smoke and without form, is shining within (the body)\nand is undifferentiated and immutable.\n\np. 272\n\nThe Vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 that dwells in this body is deluded by m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 during the states\nof waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep; but after many births, owing to the\neffect of good karma, it wishes to attain its own state. Who am I? How has\nthis stain of mundane existence accrued to me? What becomes in the dreamless\nsleep of me who am engaged in business in the waking and dreaming states? Just\nas a bale of cotton is burnt by fire, so the Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81sa 1 which is the result\nof non-wisdom, is burnt by the (wise) thoughts like the above and by its own\nsupreme illumination. The outer burning (of body as done in the world) is no\nburning at all. When the wordly wisdom is destroyed, Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma that is in\nthe \xe1\xb8\x8dahara (\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b or ether of the heart) obtains vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, diffusing itself\neverywhere and burns in an instant j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81namaya and manomaya (sheaths). After\nthis, He himself shines always within, like a light within a vessel.\n\nThat muni who contemplates thus till sleep and till death is to be known as a\nj\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada. Having done what ought to be done, he is a fortunate person. And\nhaving given up (even) the state of a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada, he attains vi\xe1\xb8\x8dehamu.kti\n(emancipation in a disembodied state), after his body wears off. He attains\nthe state, as if of moving in the air. Then That alone remains which is\nsoundless, touchless, formless, and deathless, which is the rasa (essence),\neternal, and odourless, which has neither beginning nor end, which is greater\nthan the great, and which is permanent, stainless, and decayless.\n\nThus ends the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[260:1](tmu32.htm#fr_247) In this Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d are stated the ways by which the\nKu\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab power is roused from the navel upwards to the middle of the eyebrows\nand then up to sahasr\xc4\x81ra in the head: this being one of the important works of\nan adept to master the forces of nature.\n\n[260:2](tmu32.htm#fr_248) Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada is the flitting aspect of Anta\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\n[260:3](tmu32.htm#fr_249) Lit., the moving of \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi which is Ku\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab.\n\n[260:4](tmu32.htm#fr_250) Regarding the quantity to be taken, one should take\nof solid food half of his stomach: of liquid food, one quarter, leaving the\nremaining quarter empty for the air to percolate.\n\n[260:5](tmu32.htm#fr_251) M\xc5\xablakan\xe1\xb8\x8da is the root of kan\xe1\xb8\x8da, the genital organ.\n\n[261:1](tmu32.htm#fr_252) The moving of sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab n\xc4\x81di situated on the west of\nthe navel among the 14 n\xc4\x81dis (Vide V\xc4\x81raha and other Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds).\n\n[261:2](tmu32.htm#fr_253) Sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab is called also Arun\xe1\xb8\x8dha\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab who is literally\none that helps good actions being done and the wife of \xe1\xb9\x9ashi Vasishtha--also\nthe star that is shown to the bride on marriage occasions.\n\n[261:3](tmu32.htm#fr_254) In exhalation, pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a goes out 16 digits and in\ninhalation, goes in only for 12, thus losing 4. But if inhaled for 16, then\nthe power is aroused.\n\n[261:4](tmu32.htm#fr_255) Lit., associated with and alone. _Vide_ \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87dilya-\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n[263:1](tmu32.htm#fr_256) They are Brahmagran\xe1\xb9\xadhi, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87ugran\xe1\xb9\xadhi, and\nRu\xe1\xb8\x8dragran\xe1\xb9\xadhi.\n\n[263:2](tmu32.htm#fr_257) Bandhas are certain kinds of position of the body.\n\n[263:3](tmu32.htm#fr_258) This probably refers to Sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab N\xc4\x81di.\n\n[264:1](tmu32.htm#fr_259) The text is An\xc4\x81khiam which has no sense. It has been\ntranslated as An\xc4\x81stha.\n\n[265:1](tmu32.htm#fr_260) Twelve seems to be the right number of petals in the\nan\xc4\x81ha\xe1\xb9\xada-chakra of the heart; but the moon is probably meant having sixteen\nrays.\n\n[265:2](tmu32.htm#fr_261) The passages here are obscure.\n\n[265:3](tmu32.htm#fr_262) They are M\xc5\xablaprak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi, Maha\xe1\xb9\xad, Aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra and the five\nelements.\n\n[265:4](tmu32.htm#fr_263) Here it is the astral seminal fluid which, in the\ncase of a neophyte, not having descended to a gross fluid through the absence\nof sexual desire, rises up being conserved as a spiritual energy.\n\n[265:5](tmu32.htm#fr_264) A stage of being able to convey to other bodies the\ndeity appointed by God to help in the conveying of s\xc5\xabkshma (subtle) body to\nother bodies at the expiry of good actions which contribute to the enjoyment\nof material pleasures ( _vide_ Apte\'s Dictionary).\n\n[267:1](tmu32.htm#fr_265) Melana is lit., joining. This is the key to this\nscience which seems to be kept profoundly secret and revealed by adepts only\nat initiation, as will appear from the subsequent passages in this Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n[268:1](tmu32.htm#fr_267) All these are very mystic.\n\n[269:1](tmu32.htm#fr_268) Probably it here means some part below the skull.\n\n[269:2](tmu32.htm#fr_269) Certain motions of the fingers and hands in the\npronunciation of man\xe1\xb9\xadras.\n\n[271:1](tmu32.htm#fr_270) V\xc4\x81k is of four kinds (as said here) par\xc4\x81, pasyan\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab,\nma\xe1\xb8\x8dhyam\xc4\x81, and vaikhar\xc4\xab. Vaikhar\xc4\xab being the lowest and the grossest of sounds,\nand part being the highest. In evolution v\xc4\x81k begins from the highest to the\nlowest and in involution it takes a reverse order, to merge into the highest\nsubtle sound (Par\xc4\x81).\n\n[271:2](tmu32.htm#fr_271) The first three aspects of consciousness refer to\nthe gross, subtle, and k\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87a bodies of men, while the second three aspects\nrefer to the three bodies of the universe. This is from the standpoint of the\nthree bodies.\n\n[271:3](tmu32.htm#fr_272) The egg of man--this shows that man in his formation\nis and appears as an egg, just as the universe is, and appears as an egg.\n\n[272:1](tmu32.htm#fr_273) It is the consciousness that becomes distorted and\nis unable to cognise itself through the bodies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Index of Proper Names](tmu33.htm)\n\n'
