If it be said that (this) is to be explained through successive\ncausality; we say 'no,' on account of their not being the causes of\naggregation.\n\n'If it be said that through the successive causality of Nescience and so on,\nthe formation of aggregates and other matters may be satisfactorily accounted\nfor.' To explain. Although all the entities (acknowledged by the Bauddhas)\nhave a merely momentary existence, yet all that is accounted for by avidya.\nAvidya means that conception, contrary to reality, by which permanency, and so\non, are ascribed to what is momentary, and so on. Through avidya there are\noriginated desire, aversion, &c., which are comprised under the general term\n'impression' (sa _m_ skara); and from those there springs cognition (vi _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana) which consists in the 'kindling' of mind; from that mind ( _k_ itta)\nand what is of the nature of mind ( _k_ aitta) and the substances possessing\ncolour, and so on. viz. earth, water, &c. From that again the six sense-\norgans, called 'the six abodes'; from that the body, called 'touch' (spar _s_\na); from that sensation (vedana), and so on. And from that again avidya, and\nthe whole series as described; so that there is an endlessly revolving cycle,\nin which avidya, and so on, are in turn the causes of the links succeeding\nthem. Now all this is not possible without those aggregates of the elements\nand elemental things which are called earth, and so on; and thereby the\nrationality of the formation of those aggregates is proved.\n\nTo this the second half of the Sutra replies 'Not so, on\n\np. 503\n\naccount of (their) not being the causes of aggregation'.- This cannot\nrationally be assumed, because avidya, and so on, cannot be operative causes\nwith regard to the aggregation of earth and the other elements and elemental\nthings. For avidya, which consists in the view of permanency and so on,\nbelonging to what is non-permanent, and desire, aversion and the rest, which\nare originated by avidya cannot constitute the causes of (other) momentary\nthings entering into aggregation; not any more than the mistaken idea of\nshell-silver is the cause of the aggregation of things such as shells.\nMoreover, on the Bauddha doctrine, he who views a momentary thing as permanent\nhimself perishes at the same moment; who then is the subject in whom the so-\ncalled sa _m_ skaras. i.e. desire, aversion, and so on, originate? Those who\ndo not acknowledge one permanent substance constituting the abode of the sa\n_m_ skaras have no right to assume the continuance of the sa _m_ skaras.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
