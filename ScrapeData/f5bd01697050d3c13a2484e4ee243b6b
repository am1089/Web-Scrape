Now (follows the description of) the means of purification.\n\np. 165\n\n2\\. The body is purified by water, the understanding by knowledge, the soul by\nabstention from injuring living beings, the internal organ by truth. 2\n\n3\\. Purifying the internal organ (is called) internal purification.\n\n4\\. We will explain (the rules of) external purification.\n\n5\\. The sacrificial thread (shall be made) of Ku _s_ a grass, or cotton, (and\nconsist) of thrice three strings.\n\n6\\. (It shall hang down) to the navel.\n\n7\\. (In putting it on) he shall raise the right arm, lower the left, and lower\nthe head. 7\n\n8\\. The contrary (is done at sacrifices) to the manes.\n\n9\\. (If the thread is) suspended round the neck, (it is called) nivita.\n\n10\\. (If it is) suspended below (the navel, it is called) adhopavita.\n\n11\\. Let him perform (the rite of personal) purification, facing the east or\nthe north, (and) seated in a pure place; (let him) place his right arm between\nhis knees and wash both hands up to the wrist and both feet (up to the\nankles). 11\n\n12\\. Let him not use for sipping the remainder of the water with which he has\nwashed his feet.\n\n13\\. But if he uses (that) for sipping, let him do it, after pouring (a\nportion of it) on the ground.\n\np. 166\n\n14\\. He shall sip out of the Tirtha sacred to Brahman. 14\n\n15\\. The part (of the hand) at the root of the thumb (is called) the Tirtha\nsacred to Brahman.\n\n16\\. The part above the thumb (is called the Tirtha) sacred to the manes, the\npart at the tips of the fingers that sacred to the gods, the part at the root\nof the fingers that sacred to the _Ri_ shis. 16\n\n17\\. (Let him not use for sipping water that has trickled) from the fingers,\nnor (water) that is covered with bubbles or foam, nor (water that is) hot, or\nalkaline, or salt, or muddy, or discoloured, or has a bad smell or taste. 17\n\n18\\. (Let him not sip water) laughing, nor talking, nor standing, nor looking\nabout, nor bending his head or his body forward, nor while the lock on his\ncrown is untied, nor while his throat is wrapped up, nor while his head is\ncovered, nor when he is in a hurry, nor without wearing the sacrificial\nthread, nor stretching his feet out, nor while his loins are girt (with a\ncloth), nor without holding his right arm between his knees, nor making a\nsound. 18\n\n19\\. Let him thrice drink water that reaches his heart. 19\n\n20\\. Let him wipe (his lips) thrice.\n\n21\\. Some (declare that he shall do it) twice. 21\n\np. 167\n\n22\\. A woman and a _S_ udra (shall perform) both (acts) once (only).\n\n23\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): A Brahma _n_ a is purified by\nwater that reaches his heart, a Kshatriya by (water) reaching his throat, a\nVai _s_ ya by (water barely) taken into the mouth, a woman and a _S_ udra by\ntouching (it) with the extremity (of the lips). 23\n\n24\\. \'If (drops) adhere to his teeth, (they must be considered pure) like the\nteeth, because they are fixed (in the mouth) like the teeth. Let him not sip\nwater on their account in case they fall. If they flow out, he will be pure.\'\n24\n\n25\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): If anything adheres to the\nteeth, (it is pure) like the teeth; and if he swallows (it or) whatever else\nmay be in the mouth (or) may remain after sipping water, (he will become)\npure.\' 25\n\n26\\. (After sipping) he shall touch the cavities (of the head) with water, the\nfeet, the navel, the head, (and) lastly the left hand. 26\n\n27\\. If he becomes impure while holding (a vessel) made of metal, he shall put\nit down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he is going to take it up.\n\n28\\. Now if he becomes impure (while he is occupied) with food, he shall put\nit down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he is going to take it up. 28\n\n29\\. Now if he becomes impure (while occupied)\n\np. 168\n\nwith water, he shall put it down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he is going\nto take it up\n\n30\\. That is contrary (to the rule) in (the case of an earthen) vessel. 30\n\n31\\. In (the case of a vessel) made of wood there is an option.\n\n32\\. Defiled (objects) made of metal must be scoured with cowdung, earth, and\nashes, or with one of these (three). 32\n\n33\\. Copper, silver, and gold (must be cleaned) with acids. 33\n\n34\\. Earthen vessels must be heated. 34\n\n35\\. (Objects) made of wood must be planed.\n\n36\\. (Objects) made of bamboo (must be cleaned) with cowdung, 36\n\n37\\. (Objects) made of fruits with a rope of cow-hair, 37\n\n38\\. Skins of black deer with (ground) Bel nut and rice,\n\n39\\. Blankets (of the hair of the mountain goat) with Areka nuts, 39\n\n40\\. (Cloth) made of (sheep\'s) wool by the (rays of the) sun,\n\n41\\. Linen (cloth) with a paste of yellow mustard, 41\n\np. 169\n\n42\\. Cotton cloth with earth, 42\n\n43\\. Skins (other than deer-skins shall be treated) like cotton cloth, 43\n\n44\\. Stones and gems like (objects) made of metal, 44\n\n45\\. Bones like wood, 45\n\n46\\. Conch-shells, horn, pearl-shells, and ivory like linen cloth. 46\n\n47\\. Or (they may be cleaned) with milk.\n\n48\\. (Objects) which have been defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, or a\ndead body, (but) are agreeable to the eye and the nose, shall be rubbed seven\ntimes with one of the substances mentioned above.\n\n49\\. (Objects) not made of metal which are in the same condition must be\nthrown away. 49\n\n50\\. The cups and vessels (used) at a sacrifice (must be cleaned) according to\nthe injunction (of the Veda). 50\n\n51\\. The Veda (declares), \'They do not become impure through Soma.\'\n\n52\\. \'Time, fire, purity of mind, water and the like (fluids), smearing with\ncowdung and ignorance (of defilement) are declared to be the sixfold (means\nof) purification for created beings.\' 52\n\n53\\. Now they quote also (the following verse):\n\np. 170\n\n[paragraph continues] \'A clever man, who knows (the rules of) purification and\nis desirous of righteousness, shall perform (the rites of) purification, after\nhaving fully considered the time, and the place (of the defilement), likewise\nhimself, (as well as) the object (to be cleaned) and the substance (to be\nemployed), the purpose of the object, the cause (of the defilement), and the\ncondition (of the thing or person defiled).\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[165:2](sbe1441.htm#fr_826) **8**. Vasish _th_ a III, 60.\n\n[165:7](sbe1441.htm#fr_827)-9. Manu II, 63.\n\n[165:11](sbe1441.htm#fr_828) Vasish _th_ a III, 26. Govinda points out that\nthe word _s_ au _k_ am, \'(rite of) purification,\' has here the meaning of a\n_k_ amanam, \'sipping water.\' He thinks that the _k_ a, \'and,\' which stands\nafter padau, \'both feet,\' indicates that other portions of the body which have\nbeen defiled must be washed also.\n\n[166:14](sbe1441.htm#fr_829) Vasish _th_ a III, 26.\n\n[166:16](sbe1441.htm#fr_830) Vish _n_ u LXII, 3-4. All the MSS. except M.\nplace the Tirtha sacred to the gods at the root of the fingers, and that\nsacred to the _Ri_ shis at the tips of the fingers; and Govinda has the same\nerroneous reading.\n\n[166:17](sbe1441.htm#fr_831) Vasish _th_ a III, 36.\n\n[166:18](sbe1441.htm#fr_832) Vasish _th_ a III, 30.\n\n[166:19](sbe1441.htm#fr_833)-20. Vasish _th_ a III, 26; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 3.\n\n[166:21](sbe1441.htm#fr_834) Vasish _th_ a III, 27; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5.16, 4.\n\n[167:23](sbe1441.htm#fr_835) Vasish _th_ a III, 31-34.\n\n[167:24](sbe1441.htm#fr_836) The MSS. read in the last pada of this verse,\ntesha _m_ sa _m_ sraye [ya or va]- _k_ _k_ u _k_ i _t_ iti. I think sa _m_\nsrava _n_ a _k_ _kh_ u _k_ ir iti is the correct reading.\n\n[167:25](sbe1441.htm#fr_837) Vasish _th_ a III, 41.\n\n[167:26](sbe1441.htm#fr_838) Vasish _th_ a III, 28-29.\n\n[167:28](sbe1441.htm#fr_839) Vasish _th_ a III, 43-44.\n\n[168:30](sbe1441.htm#fr_840) \'(The word) amatram, literally "a vessel,"\ndenotes here an earthen vessel. The meaning is that such a one, if it is very\nmuch defiled, shall only be put down and not be taken back. Any other (earthen\nvessel) shall be heated.\'--Govinda.\n\n[168:32](sbe1441.htm#fr_841) Vasish _th_ a III, 49.\n\n[168:33](sbe1441.htm#fr_842) Manu V, 114; Vasish _th_ a III, 63.\n\n[168:34](sbe1441.htm#fr_843)-35. Vasish _th_ a III, 49.\n\n[168:36](sbe1441.htm#fr_844) Vasish _th_ a III, 53.\n\n[168:37](sbe1441.htm#fr_845) Vasish _th_ a III, 54. Govinda thinks that the\nword ra _g_ _g_ u, \'a rope,\' is used here in the sense of \'a conglomeration,\'\nand merely indicates that a quantity of cowhair must be used.\n\n[168:39](sbe1441.htm#fr_846) Manu V, 120.\n\n[168:41](sbe1441.htm#fr_847) Vasish _th_ a III, 55.\n\n[169:42](sbe1441.htm#fr_848) Vasish _th_ a III, 49.\n\n[169:43](sbe1441.htm#fr_849) Vasish _th_ a III, 53.\n\n[169:44](sbe1441.htm#fr_850) Vasish _th_ a III, 50.\n\n[169:45](sbe1441.htm#fr_851) Vasish _th_ a III, 52.\n\n[169:46](sbe1441.htm#fr_852) Vasish _th_ a III, 51.\n\n[169:49](sbe1441.htm#fr_853) Vasish _th_ a III, 59.\n\n[169:50](sbe1441.htm#fr_854) Govinda explains this Sutra differently. He says:\n\'The fault of defilement by remnants does not affect sacrificial cups and\nvessels. This must be understood. If they are defiled by urine and the like,\nthey must be thrown away.\' My explanation is based on the parallel passage of\n\xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 13. See also below, I, 6, 13, 11 seq.\n\n[169:52](sbe1441.htm#fr_855) Vish _n_ u XXII, 88.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 5, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 9](sbe1442.htm)\n\n'
