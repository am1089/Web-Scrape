From the dark (the Brahman of the heart) I come to the nebulous (the world\nof Brahman), from the nebulous to the dark, shaking off all evil, as a horse\nshakes his hairs, and as the moon frees herself from the mouth of Rahu 2.\nHaving shaken off the body, I obtain, self made and satisfied, the uncreated\nworld of Brahman, yea, I obtain it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[143:1](sbe01173.htm#fr_361) This chapter is supposed to contain a hymn of\ntriumph.\n\n[143:2](sbe01173.htm#fr_362) Rahu, in later times a monster, supposed to\nswallow the sun and moon at every solar or lunar eclipse. At first we only\nhear of the mouth or head of Rahu. In later times a body was assigned to him,\nbut it had to be destroyed again by Vishnu, so that nothing remained of him\nbut his head. Rahu seems derived from rah, to separate, to remove. From it\nraksh, to wish or strive to remove, to keep off, to protect, and in a\ndifferent application rakshas, a tearing away, violence, rakshas, a robber, an\nevil spirit.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 14](sbe01174.htm)\n\n'
