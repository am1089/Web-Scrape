Charm of a woman against a rival or co-wife.\n\n1\\. I dig up this plant, of herbs the most potent, by whose power rival women\nare overcome, and husbands are obtained.  \n2\\. O thou (plant) with erect leaves, lovely, do thou, urged on by the gods,\nfull of might, drive away my rival, make my h usband mine alone!  \n3\\. He did not, forsooth, call thy name, and thou shalt not delight in this'\nhusband! To the very farthest distance do we drive our rival.  \n4\\. Superior am I, O superior (plant), superior, truly, to superior (women).\nNow shall my rival be inferior to those that are inferior!  \n5\\. I am overpowering, and thou, (O plant), art completely overpowering.\nHaving both grown full of power, let us overpower my rival!  \n6\\. About thee (my husband) I have placed the overpowering (plant), upon thee\nplaced the very overpowering one. May thy mind run after me as a calf after\nthe cow, as water along its course!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 138. Charm for depriving a man of his virility](av131.htm)\n\n"
