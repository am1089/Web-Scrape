The brilliant Hot _ri_  [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:1:1) has been born\n[2](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:1:2), the father to protect the fathers\n[3](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:1:3), aspiring after noble wealth. May we be able to\nbridle the strong (horse) [4](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:1:4).\n\n2\\. He the leader of the sacrifice towards whom the seven reins (or rays) are\nstretched, the Pot _ri_ promotes, as (he has done) for Manu, the divine eighth\n(rein); all those (reins he promotes) [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:2:1).\n\n3\\. Or when he has run along, and has recited the sacred words\n[1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:3:1), and has pursued that (duty)\n[2](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:3:2), he has encompassed every kind of wisdom as the\nfelly (encircles) the wheel.\n\n4\\. For He has been born as the bright Pra _s_ ast _ri_ , with bright power of\nmind. (A man) who knows his firm laws, mounts up on them as on the branches\n(of a tree) [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:4:1).\n\n5\\. The lively milch-cows were attached to his, the Nesh _t_ _ri_ 's, (bright)\ncolour [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:5:1). Was it according to the wish of the three\nsisters who have gone there [2](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:5:2)?\n\n6\\. When (coming) from the mother the sister has approached, bringing gh _ri_\nta [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:6:1), the Adhvaryu rejoices at their\n[2](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:6:2) coming as corn (rejoices) at rain.\n\n7\\. May He the _Ri_ tvi _g_ (priest) himself make the Ritvi _g_ (serve) for\nhis own refreshment [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:7:1). And may we readily gain the\npraise and the sacrifice [2](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:7:2); we have offered it.\n\n8\\. In order that He the knowing one (Agni) may readily serve all the\nworshipful (gods), this sacrifice, O Agni, which we have performed, rests in\nthee.\n\np. 207\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Anush _t_ ubh.--Verse 3 = SV. I, 94; TS. III, 3, 3,\n3; MS. II, 13, 5.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. As the Hot _ri_ is mentioned here, the following verses contain each\nthe names of the other priests as given in II, 1, 2. Only the Agnidh is left\nout; possibly the words sva _h_ sva\xc2\xb4ya dha\xc2\xb4yase kri _n_ uta\xc2\xb4m _ri_ tvik _ri_\ntvi _g_ am (verse 7) contain an allusion to this priest, who may well be\ntermed the _Ri_ tvi _g_ belonging to Agni and refreshing him.\n\nNote 2. With the first Pada of our verse, compare IX, 64, 10. indu _h_ pavish\n_t_ a _k_ etana _h_.\n\nNote 3. The meaning seems to be: Agni, who has protected the fathers, has been\nborn again, and will do the same for the present sacrificer.\n\nNote 4. The strong horse, of course, is Agni. Comp. III, 27, 3 (see below). On\nthe construction (va _g_ ina _h_ yamam), see Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, p.\n417.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On the seven rays or reins of Agni, see I, 146, 1, note 1. Besides the\nseven priests a mysterious eighth _Ri_ tvi _g_ priest is spoken of (X, 114, 9.\nkam _ri_ tvi _g_ am ash _t_ amam _s_ u\xc2\xb4ram ahu _h_ ); thus Agni has a\nmysterious eighth ra _s_ mi (ray or rein) besides the seven. Comp. Bergaigne,\nReligion Vedique, II, 144.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Vo _k_ at brahma _n_ i: this seems to be an allusion to the Brahman\npriest (see verse 1, note 1).\n\nNote 2. Ve _h_ is third singular. See Joh. Schmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV,\n91.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VIII, 13, 6. vaya\xc2\xb4 _h_ -iva anu rohate. Prof.\n\np. 208\n\n[paragraph continues] Max Muller (vol. xxxii, p. 207) translates, 'springs up\nlike young sprouts.'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. It is the Nesh _t_ _ri_ 's office to lead the wife of the sacrificer\nto the place where the sacrifice is being performed. Thus Agni, the divine\nNesh _t_ _ri_ , is represented as accompanied by female beings, by the 'milch-\ncows,' meaning the oblations of gh _ri_ ta, &c., or possibly the dawns.\n\nNote 2. Are the 'three sisters' (comp. Bergaigne, 1, 321; II, 107) identical\nwith the milch-cows spoken of in the first hemistich? Ludwig (vol. iv, p. 166)\nvery appropriately calls attention to the fact that three cows were milked at\nthe sacrifice of the full and the new moon. Comp. Hillebrandt, Altindisches\nNeu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 12 seq. Three dawns are mentioned in VIII, 41, 3.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The sister bringing gh _ri_ ta seems to be the sacrificial spoon. Is\nthe mother the milk-vessel or possibly the cow?\n\nNote 2. Does 'their' refer to the mother and the sister (cf. Delbruck,\nAltindische Syntax, p. 102)? Or are 'the three sisters who have gone there'\nreferred to?\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The one _Ri_ tvi _g_ is Agni; the other possibly is the Agnidh who\nrefreshes the Ritvi _g_ Agni. See verse 1, note 1.\n\nNote 2. After a\xc2\xb4t we should expect, instead of aram, another accusative,\npossibly _r i_ _k_ am (see VII, 66, 11): 'may we master the praise, the\nsacrifice, and the verse.' \xc3\x81ram may have found its way into the text from\nverse 8.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 6](sbe46056.htm)\n\n"
