Against sorcerers and demons.\n\n1\\. The sorcerer (yatudhana) that vaunts himsel and the Kimidin do thou, O\nAgni, convey hither! For thou, O god, when lauded, becomest the destroyer of\nthe demon.  \n2\\. Partake of the ghee, of the sesame-oil, O Agni Gatavedas, that standest on\nhigh, conquerest by thyself! Make the sorcerers howl!  \n3\\. The sorcerers and the devouring (atrin) Kimidin shall howl! Do ye,\nmoreover, O Agni and Indra, receive graciously this our oblation!  \n4\\. Agni shall be the first to seize them, Indra with his (strong) arms shall\ndrive them away! Every wizard, as soon as he comes, shall proclaim himself,\nsaying, 'I am he'!  \n5\\. We would see thy might, O Gatavedas; disclose to us the wizards, O thou\nthat beholdest men! May they all, driven forth by thy fire, disclosing\nthemselves, come to this spot!  \n6\\. Seize hold, O Gatavedas: for our good thou wast born! Become our\nmessenger, O Agni, and make the sorcerers howl!  \n7\\. Do thou, O Agni, drag hither the sorcerers, bound in shackles; then Indra\nwith his thunderbolt shall cut off their heads!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 8. Against sorcerers and demons](av078.htm)\n\n"
