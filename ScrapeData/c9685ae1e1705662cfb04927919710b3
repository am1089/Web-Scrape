And thus, even in the case of disagreement as to the\nnumber of the different instruments of knowledge, a thing devoid of difference\ncould not be established by any of them since the instruments of knowledge\nacknowledged by all have only one and the same object, viz. what is marked by\ndifference. And a person who maintains the existence of a thing devoid of\ndifference on the ground of differences affecting that very thing simply\ncontradicts himself without knowing what he does; he is in fact no better than\na man who asserts that his own mother never had any children.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Perception does not reveal mere being](sbe48014.htm)\n\n'
