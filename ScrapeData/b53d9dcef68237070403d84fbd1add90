Vyasa said :-- O King! Having the Svastyayana ceremony (a performance of\nrite to secure welfare or avert calamity) performed by the Brahma _n_ as\nversed in the Vedas, the powerful V _r_ itra mounted on his\n\n\n\np. 488\n\n\n\nchariot and started to kill Indra, the King of the Gods. The Danavas that were\npreviously defeated by the Devas now knowing V _r_ itrasura to be powerful,\ncame up to him to serve his cause. The messengers of Indra, when they saw him\nready for battle, hurriedly came to Indra and informed him all about his\ndoings and other matters connected with it.\n\n\n\n4-7. The messengers said :-- O Lord! Vis'vakarma, having been very much\ngrieved his son being slain, got very angry and by Abhichara process (an\nincantation with a design to injure or magic spells or charms used for a\nmalevolent purpose) has created a son in order to kill you. That indomitable V\n_r_ itrasura is now your powerful enemy; mounting on his chariot he is coming\nhere to fight with you, surrounded by other Asuras. O highly Fortunate One!\nThis enemy of yours is as high as the mountain Meru; he is now coming\nhurriedly to you, making a terrible noise; guard yourself carefully. O King!\nWhile Indra was hearing the messengers, the Devas came there panic-stricken\nand terrified and said :--\n\n\n\n8-16. The Ga _n_ as said :-- O Lord of the Suras! Ominous signs are being seen\nin the houses of the Gods; the birds are making sounds, very inauspicious and\nforeboding a great calamity. Crows, vultures, herons, falcons, and other ugly\ninauspicious birds are crying and making hoarse sounds on the tops of houses.\nOther birds are making incessantly harsh sounds like chichi koochy. The\ncarriers of the several Devas are weeping and shedding tears always. O highly\nFortunate One! On the tops of houses are heard very loud and very dreadful\nsounds of the crying Rak _s_ asis at dead of night. O Giver of honour! The\nflags on the chariots are falling to the ground without any trace of wind.\nThus ominous signs are being visible on earth and in the air. O King of the\nDevas! The ugly faced women, wearing black clothes, are roaming from house to\nhouse and always repeating \xc2\x93Leave the house, and go away at once.\xc2\x94 The Deva\nwomen while sleeping in their own temples are seeing in their dreams that\nterrible Rak _s_ asis, coming to them are cutting away their hairs on their\nheads and are frightening them. O Indra of the Devas! The inauspicious signs\nlike these and earthquakes and the falling of the meteors are taking place.\nThe jackals come in the courtyard of houses at night and yell horrible\nheartrending sounds. Lizards are moving always in the rooms and the several\nlimbs of our bodies are shaking and thus making very inauspicious signs.\n\n\n\n17\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing their words, Indra became very anxious and\ncalled Brihaspati, the Deva Guru, and asked him :--\n\n\n\np. 489\n\n\n\n18-20. Indra spoke :-- O Brahma _n_ a! Very inauspicious signs are being\nvisible; dreadful winds are blowing and stars are falling from the skies what\nare all these? O Intelligent One! You are very wise and versed in the S'astras\nand the Guru of the Devas; you are omniscient and know very well how to remedy\nthe evils. Therefore perform the rites by which enemies can be killed; do such\nas our miseries be all averted.\n\n\n\n21-31. Brihaspati said :-- \xc2\x93O Thousand-eyed! What shall I do? You have\ncommitted shortly a heinous crime; you killed that innocent Muni and so you\nhave earned a very bad Karmic effect. Very violent sins and good deeds produce\ntheir effects very quickly. It is, therefore, highly incumbent on those that\ndesire for their own welfare, to take up any work with great discretion. It is\nnever advisible to do any action that leads to the tormenting of others. Never\ndo they find happiness who give pains to others. O Indra! You have committed\nBrahmahattya under the influence of greed and delusion; now suddenly has\nappeared the fruit of that act. O King of the Suras! This V _r_ itra Asura is\nborn invulnerable to all the Devas. That powerful indomitable Asura chief is\nnow coming, mounted on a chariot, to kill you, surrounded by the other Danavas\nand taking with him the Vis'vakarma-made divine arms and weapons equal to\nthunderbolt. He is coming like a second Kala, as it were, to destroy the whole\nUniverse. There is none in this Triloka, capable kill him; and his death will\nnot also take place. While Brihaspati was thus speaking, a great tumultuous\nuproar rose at once. The Gandharbas, Kinnaras, Yak _s_ as, Munis and other\nImmortals began to fly away from their quarters. Indra seeing the Devas flying\naway became very anxious and gave orders at once that all subservient to him\nmust be ready at once for battle; they must go and call the Vasus, the Rudras,\nthe twin As'vins, the \xc3\x82dityas, Pusa, Bhaga, Vayu, Kuvera, Varu _n_ a, Yama and\nthe other Devas to come there at once. The enemy is well nigh; so let all the\nDevas come on their Vimanas quickly there.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n32-44. Thus ordering, Indra mounted on the Airavata elephant and taking the\nSura Guru in front started from his own temple. The other Devas mounted on\ntheir respective carriers and, firmly resolved to fight, started with all\ntheir arms and weapons. On the other hand, V _r_ itrasura surrounded by the\nDemons, came up to the beautiful mountain, adorned with trees, on the north\nside of the Manasarovara Lake. Indra, too, came there with Brihaspati in front\nand attended by all the other Devas to that mountain, north of the Manasa Lake\nand began to fight. A dreadful fight, then, ensued between V _r_ itra and\nIndra with clubs, swords, Parighas, Pas'as, arrows, S'aktis, Parsus and other\nweapons. The terrible\n\n\n\np. 490\n\n\n\nfight lasted for full one hundred human years, terrifying to the self-\ncontrolled Ri _s_ is and all the human beings. Varu _n_ a first turned his\nback; then Vayu, then Yama, the Sun and Moon and then Indra fled from the\nbattle-field. Seeing Indra and the other Devas flying away, V _r_ itrasura\ncame to the hermitage and there bowed down to his father who looked very glad;\nand he said :-- O Father! I have carried out your orders; Indra and all the\nother Devas are defeated in the battle; as elephants and deer fly away seeing\na lion, so the Devas all fled away to their respective abodes. I have taken\nthe Airavata, the best of elephants, away from Indra who fled away on foot. O\nBhagavan! I have brought the elephant here. Kindly accept it. O Father! It is\nnot advisable to kill a man who is terrified, therefore I did not kill them.\nNow kindly order anything else that I may fulfil your desires. All the Devas\nfled away from the battle-field, very much tired and terrified; and what more\nto say than this that Indra, too, fled, leaving his elephant on the field.\n\n\n\n45-54. Vyasa said :-- O King! Vis'vakarma became very glad to hear his son's\nwords and said :-- \xc2\x93Today I can rightly say that I have got my son and that my\nlife is successful. O son! To-day you have sanctified me; my cares and worries\nare abated; my mind is also calm to see your wonderful prowess. O Child! Now\nhear attentively what I say. O highly intelligent One! Now carefully sit in\nyour steady posture (Sthirasan) and practise Tapasya. Never trust anybody;\nIndra is now your enemy, ever ready to find your faults, and clever in sowing\ndissensions between you and your well-wishers. O Son! Tapasya is not an\nordinary thing; Lak _s_ mi (prosperity) is obtained thereby; excellent\nkingdoms, increase of vigour, and victories in battles are obtained. Therefore\nworship Hira _n_ yagarbha and get excellent boons from him; then kill this\nvicious Indra, guilty of the sin Brahmahattya. Worship the auspicious Creator\ncalmly and carefully. The four-faced Brahma then will be pleased and grant you\nyour desired boon. First please the Creator of indomitable prowess, from Whose\nwomb has sprung all this Universe, and get, then, immortality from Him. Then\nkill that guilty Indra, my enemy. O Son! My feeling of enmity due to the\nkilling of my son reigns always in my mind; I cannot go to sleep peacefully\nnor do I get peace in any way. The vicious Indra killed my son; O V _r_ itra!\nWhat more shall I say to you; I am merged in the ocean of sorrows; save me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n55-60. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus hearing his father's words, V _r_ itrasura\nbecame inflamed with anger and, getting his permission, set out gladly to\npractise Tapasya. He then went to the Gandhamadan mountain and performed his\nbath in the holy and auspicious river\n\n\n\np. 491\n\n\n\nManda Kini, and, preparing a Sthirasan, took his seat in the Kus'a grass, to\npractise the tapasya. He left off gradually taking his food, then subsisted on\nwater only and remained engaged in Yoga; and, seated in Sthirasan meditated\nincessantly on Prajapati, the Creator of this Universe. Indra, on the other\nhand, knowing V _r_ itrasura engaged in tapasya became very anxious and sent\nto him Gandharvas, Yak _s_ as, Pannagas, Kinnaras, Vidyadharas, Apsaras and\nother Deva messengers, all of unbounded vigour to create obstacles in his\nausterities. These Gandharvas and other Deva Yonies, expert in exercising\nmagical spells, tried many ways and means and various gestures and postures to\ncreate disturbances in his penance; but that great ascetic V _r_ itra, the son\nof Vis'vakarma did not swerve a bit from his meditative state.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Third Chapter of the Sixth Book on the defeat of the Deva army\nand on V _r_ itra's tapasya in the Mahapuranam S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4](bk06ch04.htm)\n\n"
