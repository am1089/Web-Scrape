And on account of (the Brahman to which the Souls are led) being qualified\n(in another passage).\n\nThat the soul's going has for its object the effected Brahman, we conclude\nfrom another scriptural passage also which qualifies Brahman in a certain way,\n'He leads them to the worlds of Brahman; in these worlds of Brahman they live\nfor ever and ever' (B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 15). For it would be impossible to\nqualify the highest Brahman by means of the plural number ('worlds'); while\nthe plural number may be applied to the lower Brahman which may abide in\ndifferent conditions.--The term 'world' also can directly denote only some\nplace of enjoyment falling within the sphere of effects and possessing the\nquality of being entered into, while it must be understood in a metaphorical\nsense in passages 1 such as 'Brahman is that world '(B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 23).--\nAnd also what the text says concerning an abode and some one abiding within it\n('in these worlds of Brahman,' &c.), cannot be directly understood of the\nhighest Brahman.--For all these reasons the leading of the souls has the lower\nBrahman for its goal.\n\nBut even on this interpretation the word 'Brahman' is inappropriate, as it has\nbeen proved that Brahman is the\n\np. 391\n\ncause of the origination and so on of the entire world.--To this objection the\nnext Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[390:1](sbe38309.htm#fr_229) Where the term 'world' is applied to the highest\nBrahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 9](sbe38310.htm)\n\n"
