The Brahman (superintending priest) himself should perform them,\nand no other than the Brahman; for the Brahman sits on the right (south)\n\np. 212\n\nside of the sacrifice, and protects the sacrifice on the right side. If,\nhowever, the Brahman should not know (these formulas and oblations), any one\nwho knows them may perform them; but (let him do so) after applying for leave\nto the Brahman, and with his permission. Now as to the meaning of these\n(formulas). Vasish _th_ a knew the Vira _g_  1: Indra coveted it.\n\n12:6:1:3939\\. He spake, ' _Ri_ shi, thou knowest the Vira _g_ : teach me it!'\nHe replied, 'What would therefrom accrue to me?'--'I would teach thee the\nexpiation for the whole sacrifice, I would show thee its form.'--He replied,\n'Well, but tell me, if thou wert to teach me the expiation for the whole\nsacrifice, what would become of him to whom thou wouldst show its\nform?'--'Verily, he would depart from this world to the heaven of the living.'\n\n12:6:1:4040\\. The _Ri_ shi then taught Indra that Vira _g_ ;--but the Vira _g_\n, they say, is this (earth), whence he who possesses most thereof is the most\npowerful.\n\n12:6:1:4141\\. And Indra then taught the _Ri_ shi this expiation from the\nAgnihotra up to the Great Litany. And formerly, indeed, the Vasish _th_ as\nalone knew these utterances, whence formerly only one of the Vasish _th_ a\nfamily became Brahman; but since nowadays anybody (may) study them, anybody\n(may) now become Brahman 2. And, indeed, he who thus knows these utterances is\nworthy to become\n\np. 213\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman, or may reply, when addressed as 'Brahman 1!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[206:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_553) Cf. IV, 5, 7, 6.\n\n[206:2](sbe44064.htm#fr_554) That is to say, if untoward circumstances were to\narise threatening to prevent the intended Soma-sacrifice. The mental resolve\n(sa _m_ kalpa), on the part of the Sacrificer, is the first act in the\nperformance of a sacrifice.\n\n[206:3](sbe44064.htm#fr_555) Or, it (the sacrifice), as Harisvamin takes it.\n\n[206:4](sbe44064.htm#fr_556) That is, after he has announced his intention to\nperform a Soma-sacrifice, by saying 'Somena yakshye,' 'I will sacrifice by\nmeans of Soma.'\n\n[207:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_557) See III, 6, 3, 4. This particular ceremony is\nrather out of place here, as in its regular order it should come after\n[paragraph 15](sbe44064.htm#12:6:1:15).\n\n[209:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_558) See III, 9, 4, 19, 'Thrice he presses, and thrice\nhe gathers (the beaten plants) together . . .'\n\n[210:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_559) Viz. to the Havirdhana where the cups from which\nlibations have been made are deposited on the mound (khara); cf.

This rendering takes,\nhowever, no account of the 'tu'; and, indeed, it will hardly fit in with the\nrelative clause which precedes it.\n\n[213:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_564) That is to say, when, as superintending priest,\nhe is addressed by another priest asking whether he may now begin some\nperformance, or informing him that he is about to do so, he may give the\ndesired direction.
