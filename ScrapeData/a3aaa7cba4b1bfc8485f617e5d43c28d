Savit _ri_ , forsooth, is his 1 mind: therefore he draws the\nSavitra cup. And, forsooth, Savit _ri_ is his breath (vital air);--when he\ndraws the Upa _m_ _s_ u cup, then he puts into him that vital air in front;\nand when he draws the Savitra cup, then he puts into him that vital air\nbehind: thus those two vital airs on both sides are beneficial (or, put into\nhim), both that which is above and that which is below.\n\n4:4:1:22\\. And the sacrifice, forsooth, is the seasons, the year. There, at\nthe morning feast, they are overtly attended to, in that he draws the cups for\nthe seasons; and at the midday feast they are covertly attended to, in that he\ntakes the Marutvatiya libations by means of the two Ritu vessels 2. Now here\n(at the evening feast) they neither draw any libation expressly for the\nseasons, nor is any libation taken with the two Ritu vessels.\n\np. 358\n\n4:4:1:33\\. But Savit _ri_ , forsooth, is he that burns yonder (the sun); and\nhe indeed is all the seasons: thus the seasons, the year, are overtly attended\nto at the evening feast,--for this reason he draws the Savitra cup.\n\n4:4:1:44\\. He draws it with the Upa _m_ _s_ u vessel. For Savit _ri_ is his\nmind, and the Upa _m_ _s_ u is his breath: therefore he draws it with the Upa\n_m_ _s_ u vessel; or with the Antaryama vessel, for that is one and the same,\nsince the Upa _m_ _s_ u and Antaryama are the out-breathing and in-breathing\n1.\n\n4:4:1:55\\. He draws it from the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a graha; for Savit _ri_ is his\nmind, and the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a is his body (or self): he thus puts the mind into\nthe body. Savit _ri_ is his breath, and the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a is his body: he thus\nputs the breath into the body.\n\n4:4:1:66\\. He thus draws it therefrom with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 6; Rig-veda VI,\n71, 6), 'Bring thou forth boons for us this day, O Savitar, boons to-morrow,\nboons day by day: O God, through this our prayer may we be sharers of boons,\nof a good and plenteous abode!--Thou art taken with a support!--Thou art Savit\n_ri_ 's joy-giver, thou art a joy-giver: give me joy! speed the sacrifice;\nspeed the lord of the sacrifice to (receive) his share!'\n\n4:4:1:77\\. Having drawn it, he does not deposit it; for Savit _ri_ is his (Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a's) mind, and hence this mind is restless. And Savit _ri_ is his\nbreath: hence this breath passes to and fro unrestingly. He then says (to the\nMaitravaru _n_ a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the god Savit _ri_!'\nHaving called for the\n\np. 359\n\n[paragraph continues] _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, 'Prompt (the Hot _ri_ to\nrecite the offering prayer) to the god Savit _ri_!' The Vasha _t_ having been\npronounced, he offers. He (the Hot _ri_ ) pronounces no Anuvasha _t_  1,--for\nSavit _ri_ is his mind,--'lest he should consign his mind to the fire;' and\nSavit _ri_ being his breath,--'lest he should consign his breath to the fire.'\n\n4:4:1:88\\. Then with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom 2, he draws\nthe Vai _s_ vadeva graha. The reason why he draws the Vai _s_ vadeva graha\nwith the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom, is this: on the Savitra\ngraha he (the Hot _ri_ ) pronounces no Anuvasha _t_ , and it is therefrom that\nhe is about to draw the Vai _s_ vadeva graha,--thus it is by means of the Vai\n_s_ vadeva that it becomes supplied with the Anuvasha _t_ for him.\n\n4:4:1:99\\. And further why he draws the Vai _s_ vadeva graha. Savit _ri_ ,\nforsooth, is his rind, and the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ (All-gods, or all the gods\n3) are everything here: he thus makes everything here subservient and obedient\nto the mind, and hence everything here is subservient and obedient to the\nmind.\n\n4:4:1:1010\\. And again why he draws the Vai _s_ vadeva graha. Savit _ri_ ,\nforsooth, is his breath, and the All-gods are everything here: he thereby puts\nthe out-breathing and in-breathing into everything here, and\n\np. 360\n\nthus the out-breathing and in-breathing become beneficial (or put) in\neverything here.\n\n4:4:1:1111\\. And again why he draws the Vai _s_ vadeva graha. The evening\nfeast belongs to the All-gods: thus indeed it is called on the part of the\nSaman, in that the evening feast is called Vai _s_ vadeva on the part of the\n_Ri_ _k_  1, and in the same way on the part of the Ya _g_ us, by way of\npreparatory rite, when he draws that Maha-vai _s_ vadeva graha.\n\n4:4:1:1212\\. He draws it from the Putabh _ri_ t; for the Putabh _ri_ t belongs\nto the All-gods, because therefrom they draw (Soma juice) for the gods,\ntherefrom for men, therefrom for the Fathers: hence the Putabh _ri_ t belongs\nto the All-gods.\n\n4:4:1:1313\\. He draws it without a puroru _k_  2, for he draws it for the All-\ngods, and the All-gods are everything, the _Ri_ _k_ and Ya _g_ us and Saman;\nand even in that he draws it for the All-gods, thereby it becomes supplied\nwith a puroru _k_ for him: therefore he draws it without a puroru _k_.\n\n4:4:1:1414\\. He thus draws it therefrom with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 8), 'Thou art\ntaken with a support: thou art well-guarded, well-established,'--for well-\nguarded and well-established is the breath,--'homage to the great bull!'--the\ngreat bull is Pra _g_ apati (the lord of creatures): 'homage to Pra _g_\napati,' he thereby means to say.--'Thee to the All-gods! this is thy womb,--\nthee to the All-gods!' Therewith he\n\np. 361\n\ndeposits it; for it is for the All-gods that he draws it. Thereupon he goes\n(to the Sadas) and sits down (in front of the Hot _ri_ ) with his face to the\neast 1.\n\n4:4:1:1515\\. And when he (the Hot _ri_ ) recites this (verse), 'With one and\nten for thine own sake, with two and twenty for offering, with three and\nthirty for up-bearing (the sacrifice to the gods); with thy teams, O Vayu, do\nthou here unloose them!'--during (the recitation of) this verse to Vayu the\ndrinking-vessels are unyoked 2, for beasts have Vayu for their leader; and\nVayu\n\np. 362\n\n[paragraph continues] (wind) is breath, since it is by means of the breath\nthat beasts move about.\n\n4:4:1:1616\\. Now once on a time he went away from the gods with the beasts.\nThe gods called after him at the morning pressing,--he returned not. They\ncalled after him at the midday pressing,--but he returned not. They called\nafter him at the evening pressing.\n\n4:4:1:1717\\. Being about to return, he said, 'If I were to return to you, what\nwould be my reward? '--'By thee these vessels would be yoked, and by thee they\nwould be unloosed!'--Hence those vessels are yoked by that (Vayu), when he\n(the Adhvaryu) draws the (cups) for Indra and Vayu and so forth 1. And now\nthose vessels are unloosed by him, when he says, 'with thy teams, O Vayu, do\nthou here unloose them;'--teams mean cattle: thus he unlooses those vessels by\nmeans of cattle.\n\n4:4:1:1818\\. Now, had he returned at the morning pressing--the morning\npressing belonging to the Gayatri, and the Gayatri being the priesthood\n2\\--then cattle would have come to be with priests only. And had he returned\nat the midday pressing--the midday pressing belonging to Indra, and Indra\nbeing the nobility--cattle would have come to be with nobles only. But in that\nhe returned at the evening pressing--the evening pressing belonging to the\nAll-gods, and the All-gods being everything here--therefore there are cattle\neverywhere here.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[357:1](sbe2655.htm#fr_836) Viz. that of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, the sacrificial man,\nrepresenting the sacrificer himself, with a view to the preparation of a new\nbody in a future existence.\n\n[357:2](sbe2655.htm#fr_837) See [IV, 3, 3, 12](sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:12).\n\n[358:1](sbe2655.htm#fr_838) See [IV, 1, 1, 1](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:1).\n\n[359:1](sbe2655.htm#fr_839) See [p. 351](sbe2654.htm#page_351), note\n[1](sbe2654.htm#fn_819).\n\n[359:2](sbe2655.htm#fr_840) Lit.
