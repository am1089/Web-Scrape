pride  \nThe impetuous son of Raghu cried:  \n'Soon shall mine arm with wrathful joy  \nThat city of the foe destroy.  \nNow, chieftain, now collect the host,  \nAnd onward to the southern coast!  \nThe sun in his meridian tower  \nGives glory to the Vanar power.  \nThe demon lord who stole my queen  \nBy timely flight his life may screen.  \nShe, when she knows her lord is near,  \nWill cling to hope and banish fear,  \nSaved like a dying wretch who sips  \nThe drink of Gods with fevered lips.  \nArise, thy troops to battle lead:  \nAll happy omens counsel speed.  \nThe Lord of Stars in favouring skies  \nBodes glory to our enterprise.  \nThis arm shall slay the fiend; and she.  \nMy consort, shall again be free.  \n\np. 429  \n\nMine upward-throbbing eye foreshows  \nThe longed-for triumph o'er my foes.  \nFar in the van be Nila's post,  \nTo scan the pathway for the host,  \nAnd let thy bravest and thy best,  \nA hundred thousand, wait his hest.  \nGo forth, O warrior Nila, lead  \nThe legions on through wood and mead  \nWhere pleasant waters cool the ground,  \nAnd honey, flowers, and fruit abound,  \nGo, and with timely care prevent  \nThe Rakshas foeman's dark intent.  \nWith watchful troops each valley guard  \nEre brooks and fruits and roots be marred  \nAnd search each glen and leafy shade  \nFor hostile troops in ambuscade.  \nBut let the weaklings stay behind:  \nFor heroes is our task designed.  \nLet thousands of the Vanar breed  \nThe vanguard of the armies lead:  \nFierce and terrific must it be  \nAs billows of the stormy sea.  \nThere be the hill-huge Gaja's place,  \nAnd Gavaya's, strongest of his race,  \nAnd, like the bull that leads the herd,  \nGavaksha's, by no fears deterred  \nLet Rishabh, matchless in the might  \nOf warlike arms, protect our right,  \nAnd Gandhamadan next in rank  \nDefend and guide the other flank.  \nI, like the God who rules the sky  \nBorne on Airavat 1 mounted high  \nOn stout Hanuman's back will ride,  \nThe central host to cheer and guide.  \nFierce as the God who rules below,  \nOn Angad's back let Lakshman show  \nLike him who wealth to mortals shares, 2  \nThe lord whom Sarvabhauma 3 bears.  \nThe bold Sushen's impetuous might,  \nAnd Vegadars'i's piercing sight,  \nAnd Jambavan whom bears revere,  \nIllustrious three, shall guard the rear.'  \n\nHe ceased, the royal Vanar heard,  \nAnd swift, obedient to his word,  \nSprang forth in numbers none might tell  \nFrom mountain, care, and bosky dell,  \nFrom rocky ledge and breezy height,  \nFierce Vanars burning for the fight.  \nAnd Rama's course was southward bent  \nAmid the mighty armament.  \nOn, joyous, pressed in close array  \nThe hosts who owned Sugriva's sway,  \nWith nimble feet, with rapid bound  \nExploring, ere they passed, the ground,  \nWhile from ten myriad throats rang out  \nThe challenge and the battle shout.  \n\nOn roots and honeycomb they fed,  \nAnd clusters from the boughs o'erhead,  \nOr from the ground the tall trees tore  \nRich with the flowery load they bore.  \nSome carried comrades, wild with mirth,  \nThen cast their riders to the earth,  \nWho swiftly to their feet arose  \nAnd overthrew their laughing foes.  \nWhile still rang out the general cry,  \n'King Ravan and his fiends shall die,'  \nStill on, exulting in the pride  \nOf conscious strength, the Vanars hied,  \nAnd gazed where noble Sahya, best  \nof mountains, raised each towering crest.  \nThey looked on lake and streamlet, where  \nThe lotus bloom was bright and fair,  \nNor marched--for Rama's hest they feared  \nWhere town or haunt of men appeared.  \nStill onward, fearful as the waves  \nOf Ocean when he roars and raves,  \nLed by their eager chieftains, went  \nThe Vanars' countless armament.  \nEach captain, like a noble steed  \nUrged by the lash to double speed.  \nPressed onward, filled with zeal and pride,  \nBy Rama's and his brother's side,  \nWho high above the Vanar throng  \nOn mighty backs were borne along,  \nLike the great Lords of Day and Night  \nSeized by eclipsing planets might.  \nThen Lakshman radiant as the morn,  \nOn Angad's shoulders high upborne.  \nWith sweet consoling words that woke  \nNew ardour, to his brother spoke:  \n'Soon shalt thou turn, thy queen regained  \nAnd impious Ravan's life-blood drained,  \nIn happiness and high renown  \nTo dear Ayodhya's happy town.  \nI see around exceeding fair  \nAll omens of the earth and air.  \nAuspicious breezes sweet and low  \nTo greet the Vanar army blow,  \nAnd softly to my listening ear  \nCome the glad cries of bird and deer.  \nBright is the sky around us, bright  \nWithout a cloud the Lord of Light,  \nAnd S'ukra 1b with propitious love  \nLooks on thee from his throne above.  \nThe pole-star and the Sainted Seven 2b  \nShine brightly in the northern heaven,  \nAnd great Tris'anku, 3b glorious king,  \n\np. 430  \n\nIkshvaku's son from whom we spring,  \nBeams in unclouded glory near  \nHis holy priest 1 whom all revere.  \nUndimmed the two Vis'akhas 2 shine,  \nThe strength and glory of our line,  \nAnd Nairrit's 3 influence that aids  \nOur Rakshas foemen faints and fades.  \nThe running brooks are fresh and fair,  \nThe boughs their ripening clusters bear,  \nAnd scented breezes gently sway  \nThe leaflet of the tender spray.  \nSee, with a glory half divine  \nThe Vanars' ordered legions shine,  \nBright as the Gods' exultant train  \nWho saw the demon Tarak slain.  \nO let thine eyes these signs behold,  \nAnd bid thy heart be glad and bold.'  \n\nThe Vanar squadrons densely spread  \nO'er all the country onward sped,  \nWhile rising from the rapid beat  \nOf bears' and monkeys' hastening feet  \nDust hid the earth with thickest veil,  \nAnd made the struggling sunbeams pale.  \nNow where Mahendra's peaks arise  \nCame Rama of the lotus eyes  \nAnd the long arm's resistless might,  \nAnd clomb the mountain's wood-crowned height.  \nThence Das'aratha's son beheld  \nWhere billowy Ocean rose and swelled.  \nPast Malaya's peaks and Sahya's chain  \nThe Vanar legions reached the main,  \nAnd stood in many a marshalled band  \nOn loud-resounding Ocean's strand.  \nTo the fair wood that fringed the tide  \nCame Das'aratha's son, and cried:  \n'At length, my lord Sugriva, we  \nHave reached King Varun's realm the sea,  \nAnd one great thought, still-vexing, how  \nTo cross the flood, awaits us now.  \nThe broad deep ocean, that denies  \nA passage, stretched before us lies.  \nThen let us halt and plan the while  \nHow best to storm the giant's isle.'  \n\nHe ceased: Sugriva on the coast  \nBy trees o'ershadowed stayed the host,  \nThat seemed in glittering lines to be  \nThe bright waves of a second sea.  \nThen from the shore the captains gazed  \nOn billows which the breezes raised  \n\nTo fury, as they dashed in foam  \nO'er Varun's realm, the Asurs' home: [1b](ry404.htm#fn_919)  \nThe sea that laughed with foam, and danced  \nWith waves whereon the sunbeams glanced:  \nWhere, when the light began to fade,  \nHuge crocodiles and monsters played;  \nAnd, when the moon went up the sky,  \nThe troubled billows rose on high  \nFrom the wild watery world whereon  \nA thousand moons reflected shone:  \nWhere awful serpents swam and showed  \nTheir fiery crests which flashed and glowed,  \nIllumining the depths of hell,  \nThe prison where the demons dwell.  \nThe eye, bewildered, sought in vain  \nThe bounding line of sky and main:  \nAlike in shade, alike in glow  \nWere sky above and sea below.  \nThere wave-like clouds by clouds were chased,  \nHere cloud-like billows roared and raced:  \nThen shone the stars, and many a gem  \nThat lit the waters answered them.  \nThey saw the great-souled Ocean stirred  \nTo frenzy by the winds, and heard,  \nLoud as ten thousand drums, the roar  \nOf wild waves dashing on the shore.  \nThey saw him mounting to defy  \nWith deafening voice the troubled sky.  \nAnd the deep bed beneath him swell  \nIn fury as the billows fell.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[428:1](ry402.htm#fr_909) The God of the sea.\n\n[429:1](ry403.htm#fr_910) Indra's elephant.\n\n[429:2](ry403.htm#fr_911) Kuvera,
