To every sacrifice [1](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:1:1) you hasten together\n[2](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:1:2), you accept prayer after prayer, O quick Maruts!\nLet me therefore bring you hither by my prayers from heaven and earth, for our\nwelfare, and for our great protection;\n\n2\\. The shakers who were born to bring food and light\n[1](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:2:1), self-born and self-supported, like springs\n[2](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:2:2), like thousandfold waves of water, aye, visibly\nlike unto excellent bulls [3](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:2:3),\n\n3\\. Those Maruts, like Soma-drops [1](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:3:1), which\nsqueezed from ripe stems dwell, when drunk, in the hearts of the worshipper--\nsee how on their shoulders there clings as if a clinging wife; in their hands\nthe quoit is held and the sword.\n\n4\\. Lightly they have come down from heaven of their own accord: Immortals,\nstir yourselves with the whip! The mighty Maruts on dustless paths, armed with\nbrilliant spears, have shaken down even the strong places.\n\n5\\. O ye Maruts, who are armed with lightning-spears, who stirs you from\nwithin by himself, as the jaws are stirred by the tongue\n[1](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:5:1)? You shake the sky\n[2](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:5:2), as if on the search for food; you are invoked\nby many [3](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:5:3), like the (solar) horse of the day\n[4](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:5:4).\n\n6\\. Where, O Maruts, is the top, where the bottom of the mighty sky where you\ncame? When you throw down with the thunderbolt what is strong, like brittle\nthings, you fly across the terrible sea!\n\np. 280\n\n7\\. As your conquest is violent, splendid, terrible, full and crushing, so, O\nMaruts, is your gift delightful, like the largess of a liberal worshipper,\nwide-spreading, laughing like heavenly lightning.\n\n8\\. From the tires of their chariot-wheels streams gush forth, when they send\nout the voice of the clouds; the lightnings smiled upon the earth, when the\nMaruts shower down fatness (fertile rain).\n\n9\\. P _ri_ _s_ ni [1](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:9:1) brought forth for the great\nfight the terrible train of the untiring Maruts: when fed they produced the\ndark cloud [3](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:9:3), and then looked about for\ninvigorating food [2](sbe3229.htm#an_1:168:9:2).\n\n10\\. May this praise, O Maruts, this song of Mandarya, the son of Mana, the\npoet, ask you with food for offspring for ourselves! May we have an\ninvigorating autumn, with quickening rain!\n\np. 281\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Agastya. Verses 1-7, _G_ agati; 8-10, Trish _t_ ubh.\nNo verse of this hymn occurs in the SV., VS., TS., AS.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the text of the first line is corrupt. Ludwig\nadmits this, but both he and Grassmann translate the verse.\n\nGrassmann: Durch stetes Opfer mocht ich euch gewinnen recht, Gebet, das zu\neuch Gottern drengt, empfangt ihr gern.\n\nLudwig: Bei jedem opfer ist zusammen mit euch der siegreich thatige, in jedem\nlied hat der fromme an euch gedacht.\n\nLudwig proposes to read adidhiye or devaya _d_ a didhiye, but even then the\nconstruction remains difficult.\n\nNote 1. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\xc2\xb4-ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\xc2\xb4, an adverbial expression, much the same as\nya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e (I, 136, 1); it occurs once more in VI, 48, 1.\n\nNote 2. Tuturva _n_ i _h_ does occur here only, but is formed like _g_ ugurva\n_n_ i, I, 142, 8, and _s_ u _s_ ukvani, VIII, 23, 5. Possibly tuturva _n_ i\n_h_ might stand for the host of the Maruts in the singular, 'you hasten\ntogether to every sacrifice.' As to dadhidhve, used in a similar sense, see\nIV, 34, 3; 37, 1.\n\nAs a conjecture, though no more, I propose to read evaya _h_ u.\n\n\xc3\x89va, in the sense of going, quick, is used of the horses of the Maruts, I,\n166, 4. More frequently it has the sense of going, moving, than of manner\n(mos), and as an adverb eva and evam mean in this way (K. Z. II, 235). From\nthis is derived evaya _h_ , in the sense of quickly moving, an epithet applied\nto Vish _n_ u, I, 156, 1, and to the Maruts, V, 41, 16: katha\xc2\xb4 da _s_ ema\nnamasa su-da\xc2\xb4nun eva-ya\xc2\xb4 maruta _h_ a _k_ _kh_ a-ukthai _h_ , How shall we\nworship with praise and invocations the liberal quick-moving Maruts? I read,\nwith Roth, eva-ya\xc2\xb4 _h_ ; otherwise we should have to take evaya as\n\np. 282\n\nan adverbial instrumental, like asaya\xc2\xb4 from asa; see Grassmann, s. v. asaya.\n\nIn one hymn (V, 87) Evaya-marut, as one word, has become an invocation,\nreminding us of \xe1\xbc\xa4\xce\xb9\xce\xb5 \xce\xa6\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\x96\xce\xb2\xce\xb5, or Evoe Bacche, and similar forms. Possibly \xe1\xbc\xa4\xce\xb9\xce\xb1 may\nbe viatica, though the vowels do not correspond regularly (see yayi, I, 87, 2,\nnote 1).\n\nFrom eva we have also eva-yavan (fem. evaya\xc2\xb4vari, VI. 48, 12), which Benfey\nproposed to divide into evaya-van, quick, again an epithet of Vish _n_ u and\nthe Maruts. If then we read evaya _h_ u, without the accent on the last\nsyllable, we should have a proper invocation of the Maruts, 'You, quick\nMaruts, accept prayer after prayer.'\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x8dsham sva\xc2\xb4r are joined again in VII, 66, 9. saha isham sva\xc2\xb4 _h_ _k_ a\ndhimahi. It seems to mean food and light, or water and light, water being\nconsidered as invigorating and supporting. Abhi _g_ ayanta governs the\naccusative.\n\nNote 2. The meaning of spring was first assigned to vavra by Grassmann.\n\nNote 3. Though I cannot find ga\xc2\xb4va _h_ and uksha _n_ a _h_ again, used in\napposition to each other, I have little doubt that Grassmann is right in\ntaking both as one word, like \xcf\x84\xce\xb1\xe1\xbf\xa6\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 \xce\xb2\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6\xcf\x82 in Greek.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The first line of this verse is extremely difficult. Grassmann\ntranslates:\n\nDen Somasaften gleichen sie, den kraftigen,  \nDie eingeschlurft sich regen, nimmer wirkungslos.\n\nLudwig: Die wie Soma, das gepresst aus saftvollen stengel, aufgenommen ins\ninnere freundlich weilen.\n\nIt may be that the Maruts are likened to Somas, because they refresh and\nstrengthen. So we read VIII, 48, 9:\n\ntvam hi na _h_ tanva\xcc\x83 _h_ Soma gopa\xc2\xb4 _h_ ga\xc2\xb4tre-gatre ni-sasattha.\n\nFor thou, O Soma, has sat down as a guardian in every member of our body.\n\nIt is possible, therefore, though I shall say no more, that the poet wished to\nsay that the Maruts, bringing rain and\n\np. 283\n\ncooling the air, are like Somas in their refreshing and invigorating power,\nwhen stirring the hearts of men. In X, 78, 2, the Maruts are once more\ncompared with Somas, su- _s_ arma _n_ a _h_ na soma _h_ _ri_ tam yate. Should\nthere be a dative hidden in a\xc2\xb4sate?\n\nRambhi _n_ i I now take with Saya _n_ a in the sense of a wife clinging to the\nshoulders of her husband, though what is meant is the spear, or some other\nweapon, slung over the shoulders; see I, 167, 3.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Hanva-iva _g_ ihvaya gives no sense, if we take hanva as an instrum.\nsing. Hanu is generally used in the dual, in the Rig-veda always, meaning the\ntwo jaws or the two lips. Thus Ait. Br. VII, 11. hanu sa _g_ ihve; AV. X, 2,\n7. hanvor hi _g_ ihvam adadha _h_ , he placed the tongue in the jaws. I should\ntherefore prefer to read hanu iva, which would improve the metre also, or take\nhanva for a dual, as Saya _n_ a does.\n\nOne might also translate, 'Who amongst you, O Maruts, moves by himself, as the\njaws by the tongue,' but the simile would not be so perfect. The meaning is\nthe same as in the preceding verse, viz. that the Maruts are self-born, self-\ndetermined, and that they move along without horses and chariots. In. X, 78,\n2, the Maruts are called svayu _g_ , like the winds.\n\nNote 2. I feel doubtful about dhanva _k_ yut, and feel inclined towards Saya\n_n_ a's explanation, who takes dhanvan for antariksha. It would then\ncorrespond to parvata- _k_ yut, dhruva- _k_ yut, &c.\n\nNote 3. Purupraisha may also be, You who have the command of many.\n\nNote 4. As to ahanya\xc2\xb4 _h_ na eta _s_ a _h_ , see V, 1, 4. _s_ veta _h_ va _g_\ni\xc2\xb4 _g_ ayate agre ahnam.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nVithura translated before, I, 87, 3, by broken, means also breakable or\nbrittle. Saya _n_ a explains it by grass, which may be true, though I see no\nauthority for it. Grassmann translates it by leaves. It is derived from vyath.\n\np. 284\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nSati and rati are used on purpose, the former meaning the acquisition or\nconquest of good things, the latter the giving away of them. The onslaught of\nthe Maruts is first described as violent and crushing; their liberality in\ngiving away what they have conquered, chiefly rain, is represented as\ndelightful, like the gifts of a liberal worshipper. Then follows p _ri_ thu\n_g_ rayi asurye\xcc\x83va _g_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ati. Here asurya reminds us of the asurya in\nthe preceding hymn, where it occurred as an epithet of Rodasi, the lightning.\nP _ri_ thu _g_ rayi, wide-spreading, seems to apply best to the rain, that is,\nthe rati, though it might also apply to the lightning. However, the rati is\nthe storm with rain and lightning, and I therefore propose to read _g_ a _g_\n_gh_ ati for _g_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ati. _G_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ is a root which occurs here\nonly, and _g_ a _g_ _gh_ too is a root which is unknown to most students of\nSanskrit. Benfey a, to whom we owe so much, was the first to point out that ga\n_g_ _gh_ , which Yaska explains by to make a noise and applies to murmuring\nwaters, is a popular form of _g_ aksh, to laugh, a reduplicated form of has.\nHe shows that ksh is changed into _k_ _kh_ in a _k_ _kh_ a for aksha, and into\n_gh_ and _g_ _gh_ , in Pali and Prakrit, e. g. _gh_ a for ksha. The original\nform _g_ aksh, to laugh, occurs I, 33, 7. tvam eta\xc2\xb4n rudata _h_ _g_ akshata\n_h_ _k_ a ayodhaya _h_ , thou foughtest them, the crying and the laughing.\n\nThat the lightning is often represented as laughing we see from the very next\nverse, ava smayanta vidyuta _h_ , the lightnings laughed down; and the very\nfact that this idea occurs in the next verse confirms me in the view that it\nwas in the poet's mind in the preceding one. See also I, 23, 12. haskara\xc2\xb4t\nvidyuta _h_ pari ata _h_ _g_ ata\xc2\xb4 _h_ avantu na _h_ maruta _h_ m _ri_ _l_\nayantu na _h_.\n\nIn the only other passage where _g_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ occurs, VIII, 43, 8, ar _k_ isha\n_g_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ anabhavan, applied to Agni, admits of the same correction, _g_ a\n_g_ _gh_ anabhavan, and of the same translation, 'laughing with splendour.'\n\nBenfey's objection to the spelling of _g_ a _gh_ _gh_ with two\n\np. 285\n\naspirates is just with regard to pronunciation, but this would hardly justify\nour changing the style of our MSS., which, in this and in other cases, write\nthe two aspirates, though intending them for non-aspirate and aspirate.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. P _ri_ _s_ ni, the mother of the Maruts, who are often called P _ri_\n_s_ ni-matara _h_ , go-matara _h_ , and sindhu-matara _h_.\n\nNote 2. As to svadha in the sense of food, see before, I, 6, 4, note 2, and X,\n157, 5.\n\nNote 3. Abhva is more than dark clouds, it is the dark gathering of clouds\nbefore a storm, ein Unwetter, or, if conceived as a masculine, as in I, 39, 8,\nein Ungethum. Such words are simply untranslatable.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[284:a](sbe3229.htm#fr_123) Gott. Nachr., 1876, No. 13, s. 324.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 170.
