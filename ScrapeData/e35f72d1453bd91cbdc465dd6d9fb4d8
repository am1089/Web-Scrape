Rajendralal Mitra, p. 725.\n\n[45:2](sbe15022.htm#fr_197) This verse is taken from _Ri_ g-veda-sa _m_ hita\nI, 90, 9. The deities are variously explained by the commentators: Mitra as\ngod of the Pra _n_ a (forth-breathing) and of the day; Varu _n_ a as god of\nthe Apana (off-breathing) and of the night. Aryaman is supposed to represent\nthe eye or the sun; Indra, strength; B _ri_ haspati, speech or intellect; Vish\n_n_ u, the feet. Their favour is invoked, because it is only if they grant\nhealth that the study of the highest wisdom can proceed without fail.\n\n[45:3](sbe15022.htm#fr_198) Five short sentences, in addition to the one\nparagraph. Such sentences occur at the end of other Anuvakas also, and are\ncounted separately.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2](sbe15023.htm)\n\n'
