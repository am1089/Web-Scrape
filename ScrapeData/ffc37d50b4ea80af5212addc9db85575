He practised austerities for a thousand years, striving to\nleave evil behind him.\n\n10:4:4:22\\. Whilst he was practising austerities, lights went upwards from\nthose hair-pits 3 of his; and those lights are those stars: as many stars as\nthere are, so many hair-pits there are; and as many hair-pits as there are, so\nmany muhurtas there are in a (sacrificial performance) of a thousand years.\n\n10:4:4:33\\. In the one-thousandth year, he cleansed himself all through; and\nhe that cleansed all through is this wind which here cleanses by blowing; and\nthat evil which he cleansed all through is this body.\n\np. 362\n\n[paragraph continues] But what is man that he could secure for himself a\n(life) of a thousand years 1? By knowledge, assuredly, he who knows secures\nfor himself (the benefits of a performance) of a thousand years.\n\n10:4:4:44\\. Let him look upon all these bricks as a thousandfold: let him look\nupon each enclosing-stone as charged with a thousand nights, each day-holder 2\nwith a thousand days, each half-moon-holder with a thousand half-moons, each\nmonth-holder with a thousand months, each season-holder with a thousand\nseasons, each muhurta-holder 3 with a thousand muhurtas, and the year with a\nthousand years. They who thus know this Agni as being endowed with a thousand,\nknow his one-thousandth digit; but they who do not thus know him, do not even\nknow a one-thousandth digit of him. And he alone who so knows this, or who\nperforms this sacred work, obtains this whole and complete Pra _g_ apatean\nAgni whom Pra _g_ apati obtained. Wherefore let him who knows this by all\nmeans practise austerities 4; for, indeed, when he who knows this practises\nausterities, even to (abstention from) sexual intercourse, every (part) of him\nwill share in the world of heaven 5.\n\np. 363\n\n10:4:4:55\\. It is regarding this that it is said in the _Ri_ k (I, 179, 3),\n'Not in vain is the labour which the gods favour;' for, in truth, for him who\nknows there is no labouring in vain, and so, indeed, the gods favour this\nevery (action) of his 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[361:3](sbe4364.htm#fr_713) That is, the pores from which the hairs spring.\n\n[362:1](sbe4364.htm#fr_714) Tasmai sahasrasa _m_ vatsara _g_ ivanaya ko va\nmanushya _h_ _s_ aknuyat; manushyavadhi _h_ _s_ atam ato _g_ ivato manushye\n_n_ a sahasrasa _m_ vatsara _h_ praptum a _s_ akyat.
