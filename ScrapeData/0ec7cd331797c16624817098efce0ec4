The Western monk chants his Hours--Lauds and Prime and\nMatins, and Terce and Sext and Vespers and Nones--but those footfalls of the\nSun that he commemorates were trodden long ago in the deserts of the Thebaid,\nand he sings within closed doors, holding himself snug against the chill winds\nwithout. Here in India, however, we practise the Faith in the very land, and\nevery day we realise afresh the cosmic events that gave it birth. Who has felt\nthe stillness that falls on lawn and river at the moment of noon? Who,\nwatching through long hours, has heard the distant music of the\n\np. 41\n\nflute arise by the Ganges side with the first ray of dawn? Who has wandered in\nfield and forest at the time of cowdust, and known the sudden touch of\ntwilight on the soul, without understanding why the village bells ring and\nprayers are enjoined at the stated hours? For that which in one man\'s eyes is\nsuperstition, another may know to be but an added firmness of sensation. But\nsurely of all the worships in the Hindu cycle, none has the power and force of\nthose celebrated at midnight. When slumber has fallen on men, gathered\ntogether in the great hive of Night; when even the wild creatures are still,\neach in his place on hillside or bough; when all that is trivial and personal\nhas been blotted out with the passing of the sunlight, till, in the sound of\nthe river, we can almost hear that of the far-off sea--then the lamps of the\naltar shine as though they were in truth the heart of the universe; then the\nworshipper feels himself to be but one of an innumerable host of stars and\nworlds, all of which wait with him for the dawn in the darkness of Light\nIneffable. And most of all this is true of the midnight service of the Birth\nof Krishna.\n\nAmong the higher castes in Bengal it is customary that each house shall\ncontain a private chapel of its own, and only the poor and the lowly betake\nthemselves to temples for the observance of the great festivals; but to my own\n\np. 42\n\nhousehold, perhaps as a proof of our perversity of disposition, this is rather\na reason for frequenting them than otherwise. We love to see the band of\nsimple worshippers, for the most part women, who arrive now and again and seat\nthemselves to watch the ceremony in the outer court, while an elderly priest\ngives informal religious instruction during the preliminary stages of the\nfunction. We like, too, to listen to that religious instruction itself, and to\nthe questions which now and again it has to meet. And so one night we sat on\nthe steps of a certain temple of Kali, which stands at a corner hard by and\nlooks far across the Ganges with the hay boats drawn up in line beneath the\nbank, on and on to the edge of the world in the distant North-West. The temple\nis old, and the corner rounded off with the wisdom and beauty peculiar to the\nold Indian method of laying out a town, and the image that dwells there, under\na sheltering _bo_ -tree, is known as "the Kali of the Hay-merchants." Only a\nfew years ago the spot was at the extreme end of Calcutta, but to-day this can\nno longer be said, though there is still a large open space opposite, where a\ngreat tree stands, and now and then gives a long shivering cry, as if to warn\nthe neighbourhood of coming storm.\n\nAll the evening through the street had been full of passers up and down. And\nsudden bursts of\n\np. 43\n\nsinging and sounding of _shankh_ and gongs had disturbed the ordinary quiet in\nall directions. For we are early old-fashioned folk in the Hindu quarter of\nCalcutta. Lights are out and noises hushed, as a rule, before ten o\'clock; and\nby eleven o\'clock, even on the Janmastami, everything was closed except the\ntemples. Here, by the light of his own altar, an Uriya priest still sat\nchanting the tale of the Holy Birth from a palm-leaf book. There, a few\nBrahmins chatted late round the foot of an image at which presently they would\nbe offering worship. But the bamboo mats were all up and padlocked in front of\nthe shops, and only the lamplights from the open shrines streamed across the\ncurb.\n\nIt was thus that we waited for the moment of the Birth. The temple had\ndisappeared. The tones of the kindly old priest sounded dim and far away.\nCenturies had rolled back. The walls of a prison closed about us, and we\nwaited once more with the royal victims, Devaki the mother and Vasudev the\nfather, for the coming of the Holy Child. Once more, as on the first Day of\nthe Birth, the rains seemed to fall and the winds to blow, and the only sound\nthat reached us besides the violence of the storm was the heavy breathing of\nthe guards, smitten into slumber by spirits, carrying to the prison of Kangsa\nthe commission of the Most High. Surely never was the\n\np. 44\n\nanguish of motherhood so great as on that night! Seven times had Devaki given\nlife, and seven times had it been snatched away by the cruel king her brother,\nas soon as given--for had it not been told that one of her babes should be his\nenemy and take his life? And now at the coming of the eighth child, especially\nnamed in the prophecy, and looked for with concentrated passion of fierceness\nand jealousy--how, in that seven-times wounded heart, could there be room for\njoy?\n\nHeavy moments are these, full of bitterest anguish of expectancy and dread;\nfull of the agony of love that longs to save, but finds no means for\nprotection of the Beloved, and yet at the same time moments in which is\nmingled a sense of lofty faith, a growing awe, an intuition of infinite\ntenderness and triumph.\n\nIt was over at last. Before them lay the Babe Himself, all laughter, all\nradiance. One more had been added to the "wretched births" of the Avataras,\nand even in a prison the mystery of Incarnation made itself felt.\n\nThe books say that it was the new-born child who instructed Vasudev to wrap\nhim in his cloak, and pass out of the prison to the village on the far side of\nthe Jumna, and then substitute him for the new-born girl of Nanda the cowherd\nand return. Was it so, indeed? Or was it overwhelming\n\np. 45\n\nclearness of vision that came with the presence of the Divine and seemed life\nspeech?\n\nHowever that be, it met with prompt and eager obedience from the royal\nprisoners. No mother\'s weakness of Devaki, no masculine scepticism of Vasudev,\nwas put forward to check for one moment the course of events. Concealing under\nhis mantle the shining Child, the father turned to make his way through\ndarkness and storm. The guards slept soundly; the prison doors opened silently\nof their own accord. And none had ever seen the Lord of the Worlds save him\nwho carried Him. Terrible was the storm, and full of terror the flood of the\nJumna when the moment came for crossing it. Here and there Vasudev tried, but\nit was impossible to find means, when suddenly a jackal passed in before him,\nand he, guided by this lowliest of beasts, forded the stream in safety and\nreached the hut of Nanda the cowherd. Here, too, sound sleep had fallen upon\nall, and Yasoda herself, when she awoke in the morning, did not know that the\nBoy in her arms was a changeling, nor dreamed that he was in truth of the\nroyal house.\n\nIn the prison; however, a terrible scene had been enacted. The infuriated\nsovereign, Kangsha, informed of the occurrence at last of the long-expected\nbirth, had come in person to visit the prisoners. Suspecting foul play when he\nsaw a\n\np. 46\n\nfemale child, but unable to substantiate his suspicions, he seized the infant\nby the feet to dash it to pieces against the wall. But the girl was an\nincarnation of Yogmaya, and the king suddenly found his clenched fingers\nempty, while over above him, illuminating the chamber with her glow, stood the\ngreat Goddess. "Your enemy is even now growing to manhood," she said, "in the\nvillage of the cowherds," and then the vision faded out and there was none\nwith them.\n\nPoor fate-maddened king--doomed by each act only to fill deeper the cup of his\niniquities till the destined champion should appear, and in single combat\navenge the wrongs of his people and his blood--how sad and yet how necessary\nwas the part that he played in the story of Brindaban and the wondrous\nchildhood! How strange--but at this point a movement among the priests\ninterrupted our memories and recalled us to the present. The mystical moment\nof midnight had come. The Holy Child was born once more among men, and here,\nnot in a prison but in a temple, and amidst the music of bells, with flowers,\nand lights, and incense, we were to celebrate that old-time coming of the Lord\nof Worlds. Many minutes passed in silence and prostration, and then we slipped\naway through the chime-broken hush of the quiet street to our own door.\n\nBut as we reached it we lingered for a moment\n\np. 47\n\nregretfully on the threshold. "Ah surely," said we, "this is no accustomed\nscene. For in truth we have come through wind and storm across the Jumna, and,\nbearing the Holy Babe beneath our cloak, we are but now arrived at the hut of\nNanda the cowherd in the village of Gokul."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Saraswati Puja](seh12.htm)\n\n'
