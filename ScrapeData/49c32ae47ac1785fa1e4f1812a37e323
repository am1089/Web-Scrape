XVI.\n\nThings proper to be offered as food to deceased ancestors: prohibited things.\nCircumstances vitiating a \xc5\x9araddha: how to be avoided. Song of the Pitris, or\nprogenitors, heard by Ikshwaku.\n\nAURVA continued.--"Ancestors are satisfied for a month with offerings of rice\nor other grain, with clarified butter 1, with fish, or the flesh of the hare,\nof birds, of the hog, the goat, the antelope, the deer, the gayal, or the\nsheep, or with the milk of the cow, and its products 2. They are for ever\nsatisfied with flesh (in general), and with that of the long-eared white goat\nin particular. The flesh of the rhinoceros, the Kala\xc5\x9baka potherb, and honey,\nare also especial sources of satisfaction to those worshipped at ancestral\nceremonies. The birth of that man is the occasion of satisfaction to his\nprogenitors who performs at the due time their obsequial rites at Gaya. Grains\nthat spring up spontaneously, rice growing wild, Panic of both species (white\nor black), vegetables that grow in forests, are fit for ancestral oblations;\nas are barley, wheat, rice, sesamum, various kinds of pulse, and mustard. On\nthe other hand, a householder must not offer any kind of grain that is not\nconsecrated by religious ceremonies on its first coming into season; nor the\npulse called Rajamasha, nor millet, nor lentils, nor gourds, nor garlick, nor\nonions, nor nightshade, nor camels\' thorn, nor salt, nor the efflorescence of\nsalt deserts, nor red vegetable extracts, nor any thing that looks like salt,\nnor any thing that is not commendable; nor is water fit to be offered at a\n\xc5\x9araddha that has been brought by night, or has been abandoned, or\n\np. 333\n\nis so little as not to satisfy a cow, or smells badly, or is covered with\nfroth. The milk of animals with undivided hoofs, of a camel, a ewe, a deer, or\na buffalo, is unfit for ancestral oblations. If an obsequial rite is looked at\nby a eunuch, a man ejected from society, an outcast, a heretic, a drunken man,\nor one diseased, by a cock, a naked ascetic 3, a monkey, a village hag, by a\nwoman in her courses or pregnant, by an unclean person, or by a carrier of\ncorpses, neither gods nor progenitors will partake of the food. The ceremony\nshould therefore be performed in a spot carefully enclosed. Let the performer\ncast sesamum on the ground, and drive away malignant spirits. Let him not give\nfood that is fetid, or vitiated by hairs or insects, or mixed with acid gruel,\nor stale. Whatever suitable food is presented with pure faith, and with the\nenunciation of name and race, to ancestors, at an obsequial oblation, becomes\nfood to them (or gives them nourishment). In former times, O king of the\nearth! this song of the Pitris was heard by Ikshwaku, the son of Manu, in the\ngroves of Kalapa (on the skirts of the Himalaya mountains): \'Those of our\ndescendants shall follow a righteous path who shall reverently present us with\ncakes at Gaya. May he be born in our race who shall give us, on the thirteenth\nof Bhadrapada and Magha, milk, honey, and clarified butter; or when he marries\na maiden, or liberates a black bull 4, or performs any domestic ceremony\nagreeable to rule, accompanied by donations to the Brahmans 5!"\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[332:1](vp090.htm#fr_897) See Manu, III. 266, &c. The articles are much the\nsame; the periods of satisfaction somewhat vary.\n\n[332:2](vp090.htm#fr_898) The expression Gavya implies all that is derived\nfrom a cow, but in the text it is associated with \'flesh;\' and, as the\ncommentator observes, some consider the flesh of the cow to be here intended:\nbut this, he adds, relates to other ages. In the Kali or present age it\nimplies milk and preparations of milk, The sacrifice of a cow or calf formed\npart of the ancient \xc5\x9araddha. It then became typical, or a bull was turned\nloose, instead of being slaughtered; and this is still practised on some\n[occasions](errata.htm#15). In Manu, the term Gavya is coupled with others,\nwhich limit its application: \'A whole year with the milk of cows, and food\nmade of that milk.\' III. 272.\n\n[333:3](vp090.htm#fr_899) Nagna is literally \'naked,\' but, as explained in the\nfollowing chapter, means a Jain mendicant. No such person is included by Manu\n(III. 239, &c.) amongst those who defile a \xc5\x9araddha by looking upon it. The\nVayu contains the same prohibition.\n\n[333:4](vp090.htm#fr_900) Nila vrisha; but this animal is not altogether or\nalways black. In the Brahma P., as quoted in the Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, it is said\nto be of a red colour, with light face and tail, and white hoofs and horns; or\na white bull, with black face, &c.; or a black bull, with white face, tail,\nand feet.\n\n[333:5](vp090.htm#fr_901) Very full descriptions of the \xc5\x9araddha occur in\nalmost all the Puran\xcc\x81as, especially in the Vayu, Kurma, Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, Vamana,\nand Garud\xcc\x81a. The Matsya and Padma (\xc5\x9arisht\xcc\x81hi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a) contain descriptions\nwhich are much the same as that of the Vayu. The accounts of the Brahma, Agni,\nand Varaha are less full and regular than in some of the others; and in none\nof them is the subject so fully and perspicuously treated as in our text. For\nsatisfactory information, however, the \xc5\x9araddha Mayukha and the Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu\nshould be consulted.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVII](vp091.htm)\n\n'
