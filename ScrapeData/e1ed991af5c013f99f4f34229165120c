XI.\n\nThe sun distinct from, and supreme over, the attendants on his car: identical\nwith the three Vedas and with Vishn\xcc\x81u: his functions.\n\nMAITREYA.--You have related to me, holy preceptor, the seven classes of beings\nwho are ever present in the solar orb, and are the causes of heat and cold:\nyou have also described to me their individual functions, sustained by the\nenergy of Vishn\xcc\x81u: but you have not told me the duty of the sun himself; for\nif, as you say, the seven beings in his sphere are the causes of heat, cold,\nand rain, how can it be also true, as you have before mentioned, that rain\nproceeds from the sun? or how can it be asserted that the sun rises, reaches\nthe meridian, or sets, if these situations be the act of the collective seven.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--I will explain to you, Maitreya, the subject of your inquiry. The\nsun, though identified with the seven beings in his orb, is distinct from them\nas their chief. The entire and mighty energy of Vishn\xcc\x81u, which is called the\nthree Vedas, or Rich, Yajush, and Saman, is that which enlightens the world,\nand destroys its iniquity. It is that also which, during the continuance of\nthings, is present as Vishn\xcc\x81u, actively engaged in the preservation of the\nuniverse, and abiding as the three Vedas within the sun. The solar luminary,\nthat appears in every month, is nothing else than that very supreme energy of\nVishn\xcc\x81u which is composed of the three Vedas, influencing the motions of the\nplanet; for the Richas (the hymns of the Rig-veda) shine in the morning, the\nprayers of the Yajush at noon, and the Vrihadrathantara and other portions of\nthe Saman in the afternoon. This triple impersonation of Vishn\xcc\x81u,\ndistinguished by the titles of the three Vedas, is the energy of Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nwhich influences the positions of the sun 1.\n\np. 236\n\nBut this triple energy of Vishn\xcc\x81u is not limited to the sun alone, for Brahma,\nPurusha (Vishn\xcc\x81u), and Rudra are also made up of the same triform essence. In\ncreation it is Brahma, consisting of the Rig-veda in preservation it is\nVishn\xcc\x81u, composed of the Yajur-veda; and in destruction Rudra, formed of the\nSama-veda, the utterance of which is consequently inauspicious 2.\n\nThus the energy of Vishn\xcc\x81u, made up of the three Vedas, and derived from the\nproperty of goodness, presides in the sun, along with the seven beings\nbelonging to it; and through the presence of this power the planet shines with\nintense radiance, dispersing with his beams the darkness that spreads over the\nwhole world: and hence the Munis praise him, the quiristers and nymphs of\nheaven sing and dance before him, and fierce spirits and holy sages attend\nupon his path. Vishn\xcc\x81u, in the form of his active energy, never either rises\nor sets, and is at once the. sevenfold sun and distinct from it. In the same\nmanner as a man approaching a mirror, placed upon a stand, beholds in it his\nown image, so the energy (or reflection) of Vishn\xcc\x81u is never disjoined (from\nthe sun's car, which is the stand of the mirror), but remains month by month\nin the sun (as in the mirror), which is there stationed.\n\nThe sovereign sun, oh Brahman, the cause of day and night, perpetually\nrevolves, affording delight to the gods, to the progenitors, and to mankind.\nCherished by the Sushumna ray of the sun 3, the moon is fed to the full in the\nfortnight of its growth; and in the fortnight of its wane the ambrosia of its\nsubstance is perpetually drunk by the immortals, until the last day of the\nhalf month, when the two remaining digits are drunk by the progenitors: hence\nthese two orders of beings are nourished\n\np. 237\n\nby the sun. The moisture of the earth, which the sun attracts by his rays, he\nagain parts with for the fertilization of the grain, and the nutriment of all\nterrestrial creatures; and consequently the sun is the source of subsistence\nto every class of living things, to gods, progenitors, mankind, and the rest.\nThe sun, Maitreya, satisfies the wants of the gods for a fortnight (at a\ntime); those of the progenitors once a month; and those of men and other\nanimals daily.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[235:1](vp069.htm#fr_715) This mysticism originates in part apparently from a\nmisapprehension of metaphorical texts of the Vedas, such as 'that triple\nknowledge (the Vedas) _shines_ ;' and 'the hymns of the Rich _shine_ ;' and in\npart from the symbolization of the light of religious truth by the light of\nthe p. 236 sun, as in the Gayatri, [p. 222](vp066.htm#page_222). n.\n[13](vp066.htm#fn_692). To these are to be added the sectarial notions of the\nVaishn\xcc\x81avas.\n\n[236:2](vp069.htm#fr_716) The formulae of the Sama-veda are not to be used\nalong with those of the Rich and Yajush, at sacrifices in general.\n\n[236:3](vp069.htm#fr_717) The Vayu, Linga, and Matsya P. specify several of\nthe rays of the sun from amongst the many thousands which they say proceed\nfrom him. Of these, seven are principal, termed Sushumna, Harike\xc5\x9ba,\nVi\xc5\x9bwakarman, Vi\xc5\x9bwakarya, Sampadvasu, Arvavasu, and Swaraj, supplying heat\nseverally to the moon, the stars, and to Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and\nSaturn.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XII](vp070.htm)\n\n"
