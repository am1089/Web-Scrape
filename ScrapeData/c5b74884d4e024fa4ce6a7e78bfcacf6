It\nis a tolerably comprehensive list of dynasties and individuals; it is a barren\nrecord of events. It can scarcely be doubted, however, that much of it is a\ngenuine chronicle of persons, if not of occurrences. That it is discredited by\npalpable absurdities in regard to the longevity of the princes of the earlier\ndynasties must be granted, and the particulars preserved of some of them are\ntrivial and fabulous: still there is an inartificial simplicity and\nconsistency in the succession of persons, and a possibility and probability in\nsome of the transactions which give to these traditions the semblance of\nauthenticity, and render it likely that they are not altogether without\nfoundation. At any rate, in the absence of all other sources of information,\nthe record, such as it is, deserves not to be altogether set aside. It is not\nessential to its credibility or its usefulness that any exact chronological\nadjustment of the different reigns should be attempted. Their distribution\namongst the several Yugas, undertaken by Sir Wm. Jones or his Pandits, finds\nno countenance from the original texts, farther than an incidental notice of\nthe age in which a particular monarch ruled, or the general fact that the\ndynasties prior to Krishn\xcc\x81a precede the time of the great war, and the\nbeginning of the Kali age; both which events we are not obliged, with the\nHindus, to place five thousand years ago. To that age the solar dynasty of\nprinces offers ninety-three descents, the lunar but forty-five, though they\nboth commence at the same time. Some names may have been added to the former\nlist, some omitted in the latter; and it seems most likely, that,\nnotwithstanding their synchronous beginning, the princes of the lunar race\nwere subsequent to those of the solar dynasty. They avowedly branched off from\nthe solar line; and the\n\np. lxv\n\nlegend of Sudyumna 85, that explains the connexion, has every appearance of\nhaving been contrived for the purpose of referring it to a period more remote\nthan the truth. Deducting however from the larger number of princes a\nconsiderable proportion, there is nothing to shock probability in supposing\nthat the Hindu dynasties and their ramifications were spread through an\ninterval of about twelve centuries anterior to the war of the Mahabharata,\nand, conjecturing that event to have happened about fourteen centuries before\nChristianity, thus carrying the commencement of the regal dynasties of India\nto about two thousand six hundred years before that date. This may or may not\nbe too remote 86; but it is sufficient, in a subject where precision is\nimpossible, to be satisfied with the general impression, that in the dynasties\nof kings detailed in the Puran\xcc\x81as we have a record which, although it cannot\nfail to have suffered detriment from age, and may have been injured by\ncareless or injudicious compilation, preserves an account, not wholly\nundeserving of confidence, of the establishment and succession of regular\nmonarchies amongst the Hindus, from as early an era, and for as continuous a\nduration, as any in the credible annals of mankind.\n\nThe circumstances that are told of the first princes have evident relation to\nthe colonization of India, and the gradual extension of the authority of new\nraces over an uninhabited or uncivilized region. It is commonly admitted that\nthe Brahmanical religion and civilization were brought into India from without\n87. Certainly, there are tribes on the\n\np. lxvi\n\nborders, and in the heart of the country, who are still not Hindus; and\npassages in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a and Mahabharata and Manu, and the uniform traditions\nof the people themselves, point to a period when Bengal, Orissa, and the whole\nof the Dekhin, were inhabited by degraded or outcaste, that is, by barbarous,\ntribes. The traditions of the Puran\xcc\x81as confirm these views, but they lend no\nassistance to the determination of the question whence the Hindus came;\nwhether from a central Asiatic nation, as Sir Wm. Jones supposed, or from the\nCaucasian mountains, the plains of Babylonia, or the borders of the Caspian,\nas conjectured by Klaproth, Vans Kennedy, and Schlegel. The affinities of the\nSanscrit language prove a common origin of the now widely scattered nations\namongst whose dialects they are traceable, and render it unquestionable that\nthey must all have spread abroad from some centrical spot in that part of the\nglobe first inhabited by mankind, according to the inspired record. Whether\nany indication of such an event be discoverable in the Vedas, remains to be\ndetermined; but it would have been obviously incompatible with the Pauran\xcc\x81ik\nsystem to have referred the origin of Indian princes and principalities to\nother than native sources. We need not therefore expect from them any\ninformation as to the foreign derivation of the Hindus.\n\nWe have, then, wholly insufficient means for arriving at any information\nconcerning the ante-Indian period of Hindu history, beyond the general\nconclusion derivable from the actual presence of barbarous and apparently\naboriginal tribes--from the admitted progressive extension of Hinduism into\nparts of India where it did not prevail when the code of Manu was compiled--\nfrom the general use of dialects in India, more or less copious, which are\ndifferent from Sanscrit--and from the affinities of that language with forms\nof speech current in the western world--that a people who spoke Sanscrit, and\nfollowed the religion of the Vedas, came into India, in some very distant age,\nfrom lands west of the Indus. Whether the date and circumstances of their\nimmigration will ever be ascertained is extremely doubtful, but it is not\ndifficult to form a plausible outline of their early site and progressive\ncolonization.\n\nThe earliest seat of the Hindus within the confines of Hindusthan was\n\np. lxvii\n\nundoubtedly the eastern confines of the Panjab. The holy land of Manu and the\nPuran\xcc\x81as lies between the Drishadwati and Saraswati rivers, the Caggar and\nSursooty of our barbarous maps. Various adventures of the first princes and\nmost famous sages occur in this vicinity; and the \xc3\x81sramas, or religious\ndomiciles, of several of the latter are placed on the banks of the Saraswati.\nAccording to some authorities, it was the abode of Vyasa, the compiler of the\nVedas and Puran\xcc\x81as; and agreeably to another, when on one occasion the Vedas\nhad fallen into disuse, and been forgotten, the Brahmans were again instructed\nin them by Saraswata, the son of Saraswati 89. One of the most distinguished\nof the tribes of the Brahmans is known as the Saraswata 90; and the same word\nis employed by Mr. Colebrooke to denote that modification of Sanscrit which is\ntermed generally Prakrit, and which in this case he supposes to have been the\nlanguage of "the Saraswata nation, which occupied the banks of the river\nSaraswati 91." The river itself receives its appellation from Saraswati, the\ngoddess of learning, under whose auspices the sacred literature of the Hindus\nassumed shape and authority. These indications render it certain, that\nwhatever seeds were imported from without, it was in the country adjacent to\nthe Saraswati river that they were first planted, and cultivated and reared in\nHindusthan.\n\nThe tract of land thus assigned for the first establishment of Hinduism in\nIndia is of very circumscribed extent, and could not have been the site of any\nnumerous tribe or nation. The traditions that evidence the early settlement of\nthe Hindus in this quarter, ascribe to the settlers more of a philosophical\nand religious, than of a secular character, and combine with the very narrow\nbounds of the holy land to render it possible that the earliest emigrants were\nthe members, not of a political, so much as of a religious community; that\nthey were a colony of priests, not in the restricted sense in which we use the\nterm, but in that in which it still applies in India, to an Agrahara, a\nvillage or hamlet of Brahmans, who, although married, and having families, and\nengaging in tillage, in domestic duties, and in the conduct of secular\ninterests affecting the\n\np. lxviii\n\ncommunity, are still supposed to devote their principal attention to sacred\nstudy and religious offices. A society of this description, with its\nartificers and servants, and perhaps with a body of martial followers, might\nhave found a home in the Brahma-vartta of Manu, the land which thence was\nentitled \'the holy,\' or more literally \'the Brahman, region;\' and may have\ncommunicated to the rude, uncivilized, unlettered aborigines the rudiments of\nsocial organization, literature, and religion; partly, in all probability,\nbrought along with them, and partly devised and fashioned by degrees for the\ngrowing necessities of new conditions of society. Those with whom this\ncivilization commenced would have had ample inducements to prosecute their\nsuccessful work, and in the course of time the improvement which germinated on\nthe banks of the Saraswati was extended beyond the borders of the Jumna and\nthe Ganges.\n\nWe have no satisfactory intimation of the stages by which the political\norganization of the people of Upper India traversed the space between the\nSaraswati and the more easterly region, where it seems to have taken a\nconcentrated form, and whence it diverged in various directions, throughout\nHindustan. The Manu of the present period, Vaivaswata, the son of the sun, is\nregarded as the founder of Ayodhya; and that city continued to be the capital\nof the most celebrated branch of his descendants, the posterity of Ikshwaku.\nThe Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a evidently intends to describe the radiation of conquest or\ncolonization from this spot, in the accounts it gives of the dispersion of\nVaivaswata\'s posterity: and although it is difficult to understand what could\nhave led early settlers in India to such a site, it is not inconveniently\nsituated as a commanding position, whence emigrations might proceed to the\neast, the west, and the south. This seems to have happened: a branch from the\nhouse of Ikshwaku spread into Tirhut, constituting the Maithila kings; and the\nposterity of another of Vaivaswata\'s sons reigned at Vaisali in southern\nTirhut or Saran.\n\nThe most adventurous emigrations, however, took place through the lunar\ndynasty, which, as observed above, originates from the solar, making in fact\nbut one race and source for the whole. Leaving out of consideration the legend\nof Sudyumna\'s double transformation, the first prince of Pratisht\xcc\x81hana, a city\nsouth from Ayodhya, was one of Vaivaswata\'s\n\np. lxix\n\nchildren, equally with Ikshvaku. The sons of Pururavas, the second of this\nbranch, extended, by themselves or their posterity, in every direction: to the\neast to Ka\xc5\x9bi, Magadha, Benares, and Behar; southwards to the Vindhya hills,\nand across them to Vidarbha or Berar; westwards along the Narmada to\nKu\xc5\x9basthali or Dwaraka in Guzerat; and in a north-westerly direction to Mathura\nand Hastinapura. These movements are very distinctly discoverable amidst the\ncircumstances narrated in the fourth book of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, and are\nprecisely such as might be expected from a radiation of colonies from Ayodhya.\nIntimations also occur of settlements in Banga, Kalinga, and the Dakhin; but\nthey are brief and indistinct, and have the appearance of additions subsequent\nto the comprehension of those countries within the pale of Hinduism.\n\nBesides these traces of migration and settlement, several curious\ncircumstances, not likely to be unauthorized inventions, are hinted in these\nhistorical traditions. The distinction of castes was not fully developed prior\nto the colonization. Of the sons of Vaivaswata, some, as kings, were\nKshatriyas; but one, founded a tribe of Brahmans, another became a Vai\xc5\x9bya, and\na fourth a \xc5\x9audra. It is also said of other princes, that they established the\nfour castes amongst their subjects 92. There are also various notices of\nBrahmanical Gotras, or families, proceding from Kshatriya races 93: and there\nare several indications of severe struggles between the two ruling castes, not\nfor temporal, but for spiritual dominion, the right to teach the Vedas. This\nseems to be the especial purport of the inveterate hostility that prevailed\nbetween the Brahman Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha and the Kshatriya Viswamitra, who, as the\nRamayan\xcc\x81a relates, compelled the gods to make him a Brahman also, and whose\nposterity became very celebrated as the Kau\xc5\x9bika Brahmans. Other legends,\nagain, such as Daksha\'s sacrifice, denote sectarial strife; and the legend of\nPara\xc5\x9burama reveals a conflict even for temporal authority between the two\nruling castes. More or less weight will be attached to these conjectures,\naccording to the temperament of different inquirers; but, even whilst\n\np. lxx\n\nfully aware of the facility with which plausible deductions may cheat the\nfancy, and little disposed to relax all curb upon the imagination, I find it\ndifficult to regard these legends as wholly unsubstantial fictions, or devoid\nof all resemblance to the realities of the past.\n\nAfter the date of the great war, the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, in common with those\nPuran\xcc\x81as which contain similar lists, specifies kings and dynasties with\ngreater precision, and offers political and chronological particulars, to\nwhich on the score of probability there is nothing to object. In truth their\ngeneral accuracy has been incontrovertibly established. Inscriptions on\ncolumns of stone, on rocks, on coins, decyphered only of late years, through\nthe extraordinary ingenuity and perseverance of Mr. James Prinsep, have\nverified the names of races, and titles of princes--the Gupta and Andhra\nRajas, mentioned in the Puran\xcc\x81as--and have placed beyond dispute the identity\nof Chandragupta and Sandrocoptus: thus giving us a fixed point from which to\ncompute the date of other persons and events. Thus the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a\nspecifies the interval between Chandragupta and the great war to be eleven\nhundred years; and the occurrence of the latter little more than fourteen\ncenturies B. C., as shewn in my observations on the passage 94, remarkably\nconcurs with inferences of the like date from different premises. The\nhistorical notices that then follow are considerably confused, but they\nprobably afford an accurate picture of the political distractions of India at\nthe time when they were written; and much of the perplexity arises from the\ncorrupt state of the manuscripts, the obscure brevity of the record, and our\ntotal want of the means of collateral illustration.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxv:85](vp028.htm#fr_84) P.

As observed by Mr. Mil-\nman, in his note on the annotation of Gibbon (II. 301.) which refers to this\nsubject; "Most of the more learned modern English protestants, as Dr. Hales,\nMr. Faber, Dr. Russell, as well as the continental writers, adopt the larger\nchronology." To these may be added the opinion of Dr. Mill, who, for reasons\nwhich he has fully detailed, identifies the commencement of the Kali age of\nthe Hindus, B. C. 3102, with the era of the deluge.
