Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ a! The King was a K _s_ attriya; how\ncould he go himself with his daughter Revati to the Brahmaloka (the abode of\nBrahma)? I entertain a great doubt on this point. I heard of yore while\nconversing about matters connected with the Brahmi _n_ s, that the Brahmi _n_\nonly who was self-restrained and the knower of Brahma _n_ could alone go to\nthe Brahmaloka. The Satyaloka is very hard for the worldly people to go; so I\ndoubt how the king could have gone with Revati from the Bhurloka to the\nSatyaloka. Man, when he discards his body, can go to the Heavens. So is\nrecited in all the S'astras. How then, people, while, in their human bodies\ncan go to the Brahmaloka. So cut asunder my doubts how the King Revata could\ngo to the Brahmaloka to ask the Prajapati on certain matters.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n6-16. Vyasa said :-- \xc2\x93O King! On the top of the mountain Sumeru, are located\nthe Indra's heavens called Amaravati (the abode of the Immortals) the\nSamyamani city of Yama, the Satyaloka, the Vahniloka, the Kailasa, Vaikun _t_\nha the abode of Vi _sn_ u, and others. The great archer Arju _n_ a, the son of\nPritha, went to the Indraloka and spent five years there. In ancient times,\nthe Kings Kakutstha and others went to Indraloka, in their human bodies. Even\nthe powerful Daityas used to conquer the Indraloka and resided there at their\nwill and pleasure. In ancient times, when the sovereign of the earth, the King\nMahabhi _s_ a went to the Brahmaloka, the most beautiful Ganga also was coming\nto the Brahmaloka. On the way the King saw Her. O King! Accidentally at that\ntime her clothings were cast aside by the wind; the King saw her partly in her\nnaked state, and, overpowered with lust, smiled; Ganga also\n\n\n\np. 620\n\n\n\nsmiled. Seeing the states of them, Brahma instantly cursed them; and they had\nto come in this world and take their births. All the Devas, when oppressed by\nthe Danavas, went to Vaikun _t_ ha and sang hymns to Hari, the Lord of Kamala.\nO King! Men can go to all the Lokas; in fact those high-souled men that\nperform Yaj\xc3\xb1as or severe asceticism and thus have acquired great merits, those\nperformers of Sacrifices and ascetics surely go to the Heavens. O King! It is\nonly the abundance of good merits that is the only cause of going to Heavens.\nSo you ought not to entertain any doubts on this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n17-18. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! The King Revata went with his daughter\nRevati to the Brahmaloka; but what did he do when he went there? What did\nBrahma order him? And to whom did the King betroth his daughter, when ordered\nby Brahma? O Brahma _n_ a! Speak out all these in details to me now.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n19-21. Vyasa said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Hear. When the King went to Brahmaloka to ask\nabout the proper bridegroom of his daughter, there was going on singing and\nmusic; so he waited a while to find an opportunity when the assembly would\nhave a leisure; but he was so very pleased with music that he could not desist\nfrom hearing it till the end. When the music was finished, the King bowed down\nto Brahma and shewed him his daughter and informed Him of his intention.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22-26. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Deva! This good daughter is mine; now kindly say\nwho will be her bridegroom. O Brahma! To whom shall I betroth this daughter? I\nhave come to you to ask on this point I have searched for many princes and\nseen also a good many of them and none of them is to my liking and so my mind\nis not at rest. O Lord of the Devas! Therefore I have come to you. Kindly\nselect one bridegroom for her. He is to be a Kulin (of good family), powerful,\nreligious, liberal, and a prince endowed with all auspicious qualities. This\nis my prayer.\xc2\x94 Vyasa said :-- O King! Brahma, the lotus-born, the Creator of\nthe world, hearing these words, laughed, thinking that a very long interval\nhad passed away. He then said :--\n\n\n\n27-43. O King! The princes that you thought would become the bridegroom of\nyour daughter, all died; their sons and grandsons and their friends even have\nall passed away. The twenty-seventh Manvantara of the Dvapara Yuga is now\ngoing on; so none of the princes of your family are now existing. The Daityas\nsacked your city. Now Ugrasena, the King of Mathura, is reigning in that\nplace. He belongs to the illustrious lunar family of Yayati. His son, the\npowerful Ka _n_ sa,\n\n\n\np. 621\n\n\n\nborn of a Danava, began to do injuries always to the Devas; he threw his own\nfather to the prison. Becoming very haughty, he began to govern himself the\ncountries of other kings and began to tyrranise over the subjects. O King. The\nEarth became so much troubled by the armies of the wicked Demon Kings, that\nShe became quite unable to bear further loads. So She went to seek refuge to\nBrahma. Brahma and the other Devas then began to say :-- \xc2\x93O Earth! To remove\nyour burden the lotus-eyed Naraya _n_ a will incarnate Himself as part\nincarnation in the form of S'ri Kri _sn_ a. He who is Naraya _n_ a practised\nin ancient times, as the son of Dharma, a very severe asceticism, in company\nwith his brother Nara in the sacred hermitage of Badari. Now this very Deva is\nborn in the great family of Yadu in the womb of Devaki by Vasudeva and is now\ncelebrated by the name of Vasudeva. O King! He has slain that vicious wicked\nKan _s_ a and has installed Ugrasena in his place. The very powerful\nJarasandha, the vicious King of Magadha, is the father-in-law of Kan _s_ a. On\nhearing the death of his son-in-law, he became infuriated with rage, came to\nMathura, and raged a terrible war. Vasudeva defeated in a battle that\nJarasandha, proud of his mighty valour. Though defeated, Jarasandha sent\nKalayavana with his host of army to fight again with Kri _sn_ a. Bhagavan\nVasudeva, when he heard that the King of Yavanas arrived, sent away all the\nmembers of his family and the Yadavas to Dvarka and began to wait with his\nbrother Balarama for the Yavana King. Then he went alone to the camp of Yavana\nand led him away to a mountain cave where was sleeping the King Muchu Kunda\nand had then the Yavana King slain by Muchukunda. Kri _sn_ a then went to\nDvarka. The city of Dvarka was then a dilapidated condition. Kri _sn_ a\nbrought together the artists and got built exquisitely the beautiful palaces,\nforts, and markets and stalls, etc., and so added to the beauty of the place.\nThat Vasudeva, of mighty prowess, thus improving the city, made Ugrasena the\nKing of that place; and Kri _sn_ a is now waiting there with his friends. His\nelder brother Baladeva, the carrier of the plough, is celebrated. Thus he with\nMusala in his hands is a great warrior and the part incarnation of Ananta\nDeva. He is the fit bridegroom of your daughter. So give your daughter in\nmarriage, without any delay, according to the rules of the marriage ceremony\nto Sankar _s_ a _n_ a Balabhadra. After giving your daughter marriage, go to\nthe hermitage of Badari and practise tapasya. That sacred retreat is the\n(park) recreation ground of the Devas, holy and yielding to human beings the\nobjects of their desires.\n\n\n\n44-46. Vyasa said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Thus ordered by the lotus-born Brahma, the King\nwent to Dvarka with his daughter. Reaching there he gave over his all\nauspicious daughter in marriage to Bala Deva\n\n\n\np. 622\n\n\n\nduly according to the rules and regulations. At last, according to Brahma's\ninjunction, he became engaged in severe austerities in the Badarikas'ram and,\nwhen the time of death arrived, left off his mortal coil on the banks of the\nriver and went to the world of Gods.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n47-48. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! You have uttered one wonderful thing.\nOne hundred and eight Yugas passed away when the King of Revata with his\ndaughter was deeply absorbed in hearing music in the Brahmaloka yet neither\nthe good King nor the daughter did get sufficiently old. How could this be!\nHow could they have lived so long! Were their longevities ordained to be such\na long period!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n49-56. Vyasa said :-- \xc2\x93O King! The Brahmaloka is not touched by any vice nor\nsin; old age, hunger, thirst or fear of death nothing exists there; nor is\nthere any other cause by which weariness comes. So what doubt there can be\nthat the people there will be long-lived, free from old age and death! When\nthe King S'aryati went up to the Heavens, his sons were all destroyed by the\nRaksasas; those that remained, they, terrified left Kus'asthali and fled on\nall sides. Vaivasvata Manu sneezed; owing to that, came out of his nose one\npowerful son; his name was Iksaku. He spread the Solar dynasty and became\ncelebrated. Getting excellent initiation from the Mahar _s_ i Narada, he began\nto meditate the Devi constantly and practised severe tapasya for the spread of\nhis race. O King! Iksaku had one hundred sons; Vikuksi was the eldest; he was\npowerful and endowed with great strength. Iksaku became king and lived in\nAyodhya. He sent his fifty sons, the powerful S'akuni and others to\nUttarapatha (Eastern) provinces for governing those countries. That high-\nsouled monarch sent also other eight sons to govern the countries in the\nSouth. (Western). O King! He kept the remaining two sons by his side for his\nown service.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the story of the King\nRevata and the spread of the Solar dynasty in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad\nDevi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk07ch09.htm)\n\n"
