For meditation, owing to the absence of purpose.\n\nAs no other purpose can be assigned, the text must be supposed to represent\nBrahman as having joy for its head, and so on, for the purpose of meditation.\nIn order to accomplish the meditation on Brahman which is enjoined in the text\n'he who knows (i.e. meditates on) Brahman reaches the Highest,' the text\nrepresents the Brahman consisting of bliss as made up of joy, satisfaction,\n&c., and compares these to the head, the wings, and so on. The Self of bliss,\nwhich is the inmost of all the Selfs mentioned in the text, is by this means\nrepresented to the mind in a definite shape; just as in the preceding sections\nthe Self of food, the Self of breath, and the rest had similarly been\nrepresented in definite shapes, consisting of head, wings, and so on. As thus\nthe qualities of having joy for its head, &c. are merely secondary marks of\nthe Self of bliss, they are not necessarily included in each meditation that\ninvolves the idea of that Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15.
