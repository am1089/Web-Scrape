THE Pupil asks: 'At whose wish does the mind sent forth proceed on its\nerrand? At whose command does the first breath go forth? At whose wish do we\nutter this speech? What god directs the eye, or the ear?'\n\n2\\. The Teacher replies: 'It is the ear of the ear, the mind of the mind, the\nspeech of speech, the breath of breath, and the eye of the eye. When freed\n(from the senses) the wise, on departing from this world, become immortal 1.\n\n3\\. 'The eye does not go thither, nor speech, nor mind. We do not know, we do\nnot understand, how any one can teach it.\n\n4\\. 'It is different from the known, it is also above the unknown, thus we\nhave heard from those of old, who taught us this 2.\n\n5\\. 'That which is not expressed by speech and\n\np. 148\n\nby which speech is expressed, that alone know as Brahman, not that which\npeople here adore.\n\n6\\. 'That which does not think by mind, and by which, they say, mind is\nthought 1, that alone know as Brahman, not that which people here adore.\n\n7\\. 'That which does not see by the eye, and by which one sees (the work of)\nthe eyes, that alone know as Brahman, not that which people here adore.\n\n8\\. 'That which does not hear by the ear, and by which the ear is heard, that\nalone know as Brahman, not that which people here adore.\n\n9\\. 'That which does not breathe by breath, and by which breath is drawn, that\nalone know as Brahman, not that which people here adore.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[147:1](sbe01176.htm#fr_367) This verse admits of various translations, and\nstill more various explanations. Instead of taking vaka _m_ , like all the\nother words, as a nominative, we might take them all as accusatives, governed\nby atimu _k_ ya, and sa u pra _n_ asya pra _n_ a _h_ as a parenthetical\nsentence. What is meant by the ear of the ear is very fully explained by the\ncommentator, but the simplest acceptation would seem to take it as an answer\nto the preceding questions, so that the car of the ear should be taken for him\nwho directs the ear, i. e. the Self, or Brahman. This will become clearer as\nwe proceed.\n\n[147:2](sbe01176.htm#fr_368) Cf. \xc3\x8e _s_ a Up. II; 13.\n\n[148:1](sbe01176.htm#fr_369) The varia lectio manaso matam (supported also by\nthe commentary) is metrically and grammatically easier, but it may be, for\nthat very reason, an emendation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Khanda II](sbe01177.htm)\n\n"
