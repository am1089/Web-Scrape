Now he should examine the ground in the following ways.\n\n2\\. He should dig a pit knee-deep and fill it again with the same earth (which\nhe has taken out of it).\n\n3\\. If (the earth) reaches out (of the pit, the ground is) excellent; if it is\nlevel, (it is) of middle quality; if it does not fill (the pit, it is) to be\nrejected.\n\n4\\. After sunset he should fill (the pit) with water and leave it so through\nthe night.\n\n5\\. If (in the morning) there is water in it, (the ground is) excellent; if it\nis moist, (it is) of middle quality; if it is dry, (it is) to be rejected.\n\n6\\. White (ground), of sweet taste, with sand on the surface, (should be\nelected) by a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n7\\. Red (ground) for a Kshatriya.\n\n8\\. Yellow (ground) for a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n9\\. He should draw a thousand furrows on it and should have it measured off as\nquadrangular, with equal sides to each (of the four) directions;\n\n10\\. Or as an oblong quadrangle.\n\np. 213\n\n11 11. With a _S_ ami branch or an Udumbara branch he sprinkles it (with\nwater), going thrice round it, so that his right side is turned towards it,\nreciting the _S_ antatiya hymn.\n\n12\\. And (so he does again three times) pouring out water without\ninterruption, with the three verses, 'O waters, ye are wholesome' (Rig-veda X,\n9, 1 seqq.).\n\n13 13. In the interstices between the bamboo staffs he should have the\n(single) rooms constructed.\n\n14\\. Into the pits in which the posts are to stand, he should have an Avaka,\ni.e. (the water-plant called) _S_ ipala put down; then fire will not befall\nhim: thus it is understood (in the _S_ ruti).\n\n15 15. Having put (that plant) into the pit in which the middle-post is to\nstand, he should spread (on it) eastward-pointed and northward-pointed Ku _s_\na grass and should sprinkle (on that grass) water into which rice and barley\nhave been thrown, with (the words), 'To the steady one, the earth-demon,\nsvaha!'\n\n16 16. He then should, when (the middle-post) is being erected, recite over it\n(the two verses), 'Stand here, fixed in the ground, prosperous, long-lasting\n(?),\n\np. 214\n\nstanding amid prosperity. May the malevolent ones not attain thee!\n\n'To thee (may) the young child (come), to thee the calf . . .; to thee (may)\nthe cup of Parisrut (come); (to thee) may they come with pots of curds.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[213:11](sbe29131.htm#fr_513) 8, 11.
