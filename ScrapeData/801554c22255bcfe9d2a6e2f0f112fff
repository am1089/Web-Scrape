The new-born calf looks very lively, blithe, and merry. It jumps and\nruns all day long, and only stops to suck the sweet milk from its darn. But no\nsooner is the rope placed round its neck than it begins to pine away\ngradually, and, far from being merry, wears a dejected and sorry appearance,\nand gets almost reduced to a skeleton. So long as a boy has no concern with\nthe affairs of the world he is as merry as the day is long. But when he once\n\np. 168\n\nfeels the weight of the responsibilities of a man of family, by binding\nhimself in time to the world by the indissoluble tie of wedlock, then he no\nlonger appears jolly, but wears the look of dejection, care, and anxiety, and\nis seen to lose the glow of health from his cheeks, while wrinkles gradually\nmake their appearance over the forehead. Blessed is he that remains a boy\nthroughout his life, free as the morning air, fresh as a newly-blown flower,\nand pure as a dewdrop.\n\n301\\. A boat may stay in the water, but water should not stay in the boat. An\naspirant may live in the world, but the world should not live in him.\n\n302\\. He who thinks his spiritual guide a mere man, can-not derive any benefit\nfrom him.\n\n303\\. What you think you should say. Let there be a harmony between your\nthoughts and your words; otherwise, if you merely tell that God is your all in\nall, while your mind has made the world its all in all, you cannot derive any\nbenefit thereby.\n\n304\\. A young plant should be always protected by a fence from the mischief of\ngoats and cows and little urchins. But when once it becomes a big tree, a\nflock of goats or a herd of cows may find shelter under its spreading boughs,\nand fill their stomachs with its leaves. So when you have but little faith\nwithin you, you should protect it from the evil influences of bad company and\nworldliness. But when once you grow strong in faith, no worldliness or evil\ninclination will dare approach your holy presence; and many who are wicked\nwill become godly through your holy contact.\n\np. 169\n\n305\\. If you wash the body of an elephant and set him at large, he is sure to\nget himself dirtied in no time, but if after washing him you tie him down to\nhis own room he will remain clean. So if by the good influences of holy men\nyou once become pure in spirit, and then allow yourself the liberty to mix\nfreely with worldly men, you are sure to lose that purity soon; but if you\nkeep your mind fixed on your God, you will never more get soiled in spirit.\n\n306\\. Where does the strength of an aspirant lie? It is in his tears. As a\nmother gives her consent to fulfil the desire of her importunately weeping\nchild, so God vouchsafes to His weeping son whatever he is crying for.\n\n307\\. Meditate on God either in an unknown corner, or in the solitude of\nforests, or within your own mind.\n\n308\\. Chant forth the sweet name of Hari (God), keeping time all the while by\nclapping your hands, then you will acquire mental concentration. If you clap\nyour hands, sitting under a tree, the birds on the boughs thereof will fly\naway in all directions, and when you chant forth the name of Hari and clap\nyour hands, all evil thoughts will fly away from your mind.\n\n309, 310. As the same fish is dressed into soup, curry, or cutlet, and each\nhas his own choice dish of it, so the Lord of the Universe, though one,\nmanifests Himself differently according to the different likings of His\nworshippers, and each of these has his own taste of God, which he values the\nmost. To some He is a kind master or a loving father,\n\np. 170\n\na sweet smiling mother or a devout friend, and to others a faithful husband or\na dutiful and obliging son.\n\n311\\. Bow down and adore where others kneel, for where so many hearts have\nbeen paying the tribute of adoration, the kind Lord will manifest Himself, for\nHe is all mercy.\n\n312\\. There are men, who, although they have nothing to attract them in this\nworld, create some attachments for themselves, and so try to bind themselves\nto this earth. They do not want and do not like to be free. A man who has no\nfamily to care for, no relatives to look after, generally takes a cat, or a\nmonkey, or a dog, or a bird for a pet object and companion; and thus slakes\nhis thirst for milk by drinking mere whey. Such is the power of Maya or\nNescience over humanity.\n\n313, 314. A patient, in high fever and excess of thirst, imagines that he can\ndrink away quite a sea of water; but when that fit of fever goes and he\nregains his normal temperature, he can barely quaff off a single cupful of\nwater, and his thirst is at once appeased with even a very small quantity of\nit. So a man, being under the feverish excitement of Maya, and forgetful of\nhis own littleness, imagines that he can embrace the whole of Divinity within\nhis own bosom, but when the illusion passes away a single ray of Divine Light\nis seen to be sufficient to flood him with eternal divine bliss.\n\n315\\. A man, under the influence of very high fever and in excessive thirst,\nis placed between a row of pitchers\n\np. 171\n\nfilled with cold water and a set of open-mouthed bottles filled with flavoury\nsauces. Is it possible for the thirsty and restless patient in such a case to\nrefrain from either drinking the water or from tasting the sauces placed so\nnear him, although thereby his case may become worse? Even such is the case\nwith the man who is under the maddening influence of his ever-active and\nmisleading senses when he is placed between the attractions of woman's charm\non the one side and those of wealth on the other. It is then difficult for him\nto behave properly, and he is liable to deviate often from the true path and\nthus make his case worse.\n\n316\\. None ventures to keep milk in a vessel in which curd had formerly\nformed, lest the milk itself should get curdled. Nor can the vessel be safely\nused for other working purposes lest it should crack upon the fire. It is\ntherefore almost useless. A good and experienced preceptor does not entrust to\na worldly man valuable and exalting precepts, for he is sure to misinterpret\nand misuse them to suit his own mean designs. Nor will he ask him to do any\nuseful work that may cost a little labour, lest he should think that the\npreceptor was taking undue advantage of him.\n\n317\\. When a certain quantity of pure milk is mixed with double the quantity\nof water, it takes a long time and much labour to thicken it to the\nconsistency of Kshira (condensed milk). The mind of a worldly man is largely\ndiluted with the filthy water of evil and impure thoughts, and it requires\n\np. 172\n\nmuch time and labour before anything can be done to purify and give the proper\nconsistency to it.\n\n318\\. The vanities of all others may gradually die out, but the vanity of a\nsaint as regards his sainthood is hard indeed to wear away.\n\n319\\. Of the grains of paddy which are fried in a frying-pan, the few which\nleap out of the pan and burst outside are the best fried, being without the\nslightest mark of any tinge; while every one of the properly-fried grains in\nthe pan itself is sure to have at least a very small charred mark of a burn.\nSo of all good devotees, the few who altogether give up the world and go out\nof it are perfect without any spot, while even the best of those devotees who\nare in the world must have at least some small spot of imperfection in their\ncharacter.\n\n320\\. We cannot say that God is gracious because He feeds us, for every father\nis bound to supply his children with food; but when He keeps us from going\nastray, and holds us back from temptations, then He is truly gracious.\n\n321\\. If you can detect and find out the universal illusion or Maya, it will\nfly away from you, just as a thief runs away when found out.\n\n322\\. Fire itself has no definite shape, but in glowing embers it assumes\ncertain forms, and the formless fire is then endowed with forms. Similarly,\nthe formless God sometimes invests Himself with definite forms.\n\n323\\. Should we pray aloud unto God? Pray unto Him\n\np. 173\n\nin any way you like. He is sure to hear you, for He can hear even the footfall\nof an ant.\n\n324\\. He who tries to give one an idea of God by mere book-learning is like\nthe man who tries to give one an idea of Ka _s_ i (Benares) by means of a map\nor a picture.\n\n325\\. A man began to sink a well, but having dug down to the depth of twenty\ncubits he could not find the least trace of the water-spring which was to feed\nhis well. So he desisted from the work and selected another place for the\npurpose. There he dug deeper than before, but even then he could not find any\nwater. So again he selected another spot and dug still deeper than before, but\nit was also of no avail. At last in utter disgust he gave up the task\naltogether. The sum total of the depths of these three wells was little short\nof a hundred cubits. Had he had the patience to devote even a half of the\nwhole of this labour to his first well, without shifting the site of the well\nfrom place to place, he would surely have been successful in getting water.\nSuch is the case with men who continually shift their positions in regard to\nfaith. In order to meet with success we should devote ourselves entirely to a\nsingle object of faith, without being doubtful as to its efficacy.\n\n326\\. Although in a grain of paddy the germ is considered the only necessary\nthing (for germination and growth), while the husk or chaff is considered to\nbe of no importance, still if the unhusked grain be put into the ground it\nwill not sprout up and grow into a plant and produce rice. To get a crop one\nmust needs sow the grain with the husk on; but\n\np. 174\n\nif one wants to get at the germinating matter itself he must first perform the\noperation of removing the husk from the seed. So rites and ceremonies are\nnecessary for the growth and perpetuation of a religion. They are the\nreceptacles that contain the seeds of truth, and consequently every man must\nperform them before he reaches the central truth.\n\n327\\. The pearl-oyster that contains the precious pearl is in itself of very\nlittle value, but it is essential for the growth of the pearl. The shell\nitself is of no use to the man who has got the pearl, neither are ceremonies\nand rites necessary for him who has attained the Highest Truth --God.\n\n328\\. A woodcutter led a very miserable life with the small means he could\nprocure by daily selling the load of wood brought from a neighbouring forest.\nOnce a Sa _m_ nyasin, who was wending his way through the forest, saw him at\nwork, and advised him to proceed onward into the interior recesses of the\nforest, intimating to him that he would be a gainer thereby. The woodcutter\nobeyed the injunction and proceeded onward till he came to a sandal-wood tree,\nand being much pleased he took away with him as many sandal-logs as he could\ncarry, and sold them in the market and derived much profit. Then he began to\nthink within himself why the good Sa _m_ nyasin did not tell him anything\nabout the wood of the sandal-trees, but simply advised him to proceed onward\ninto the interior of the forest. So the next day he went on even beyond the\nplace of the sandal-wood, and at last\n\np. 175\n\ncame upon a copper-mine, and he took with him as much copper as he could\ncarry, and selling it in the market got much money by it. Next day, without\nstopping at the copper-mine, he proceeded further still, as the Sadhu had\nadvised him to do, and came upon a silver-mine, and took with him as much of\nit as he could carry, and sold it all and got even more money; and so daily\nproceeding further and further he got at gold-mines and diamond-mines, and at\nlast became exceedingly rich. Such is also the case with the man who aspires\nafter true knowledge. If he does not stop in his progress after attaining a\nfew extraordinary and supernatural powers, he at last becomes really rich in\nthe eternal knowledge of truth.\n\n329\\. If you first smear the palms of your hands with oil and then break open\nthe jack-fruit, the sticky milky exudation of the fruit will not stick to your\nhands and trouble you. So if you first fortify yourself with the true\nknowledge of the Universal Self, and then live in the midst of wealth and\nwomen, they will affect you in no way.\n\n330\\. He who would learn to swim must attempt swimming for some days. No one\ncan venture to swim in the sea after a single day's practice. So if you want\nto swim in the sea of Brahman, you must make many ineffectual attempts at\nfirst, before you can successfully swim therein.\n\n331\\. When does a man get his salvation? When his egoism dies.\n\n332\\. When a sharp thorn finds its way into the sole of one's foot, one takes\nanother thorn to get the former out,\n\np. 176\n\nand then casts both of them away. So relative knowledge alone can remove the\nrelative ignorance which blinds the eye of the Self. As both such knowledge\nand ignorance are comprised truly under Nescience, the man who attains the\nhighest _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana, or knowledge of the Absolute, does away with both\nknowledge and ignorance in the end, being himself free from all duality.\n\n333\\. To drink pure water from a shallow pond, one should gently take the\nwater from the surface, and not disturb it. If it is disturbed the sediments\nwill rise up from the bottom and make the whole water muddy. If you desire to\nbe pure, have firm faith and slowly go on with your devotional practices, and\nwaste not your energies in useless scriptural discussions and arguments. The\nlittle brain will otherwise be muddled.\n\n334\\. If this body is worthless and transitory, why do pious and devout men\ntake care of it? No one takes care of an empty box. All protect with care a\nchest full of precious jewels, gold, and costly articles. The pious soul\ncannot help taking care of the body in which the Divine one dwells, for all\nour bodies form the playground of the Deity.\n\n335\\. The tender bamboo can be easily bent, but the full-grown bamboo breaks\nwhen an attempt is made to bend it. It is easy to bend young hearts towards\ngood, but the heart of the old escapes the hold when so drawn.\n\n338\\. The locomotive engine easily drags along a train of\n\np. 177\n\nheavily-laden carriages. So the loving children of God, firm in their faith\nand devotion to Him, feel no trouble in passing through all the worries and\nanxieties of life, and leading many men along with them to God.\n\n337\\. Every man should follow his own religion. A Christian should follow\nChristianity, a Mohammedan should follow Mohammedanism, and so on. For the\nHindus the ancient path, the path of the Aryan Rishis, is the best.\n\n338, 339. He alone is the true man who is illumined with the light of true\nknowledge. Others are men in name only.\n\n340\\. The magnetic needle always points towards the North, and hence it is\nthat the sailing-vessel does not lose her course. So long as the heart of man\nis directed towards God he cannot be lost in the ocean of worldliness.\n\n341\\. As the village maidens in India carry four or five pots of water placed\none over the other upon their heads, talking all the way with one another\nabout their own joys and sorrows, and yet do not allow one drop of water to be\nspilt, so must the traveller in the path of virtue walk along. In whatever\ncircumstances he may be placed, let him always take heed that his heart does\nnot swerve from the true path.\n\n342\\. In our theatrical exhibitions wherein the life and exploits of K _ri_ sh\n_n_ a are exhibited, the performance commences with the beating of drums and\nthe singing aloud of 'O K _ri_ sh _n_ a, come; come, O dear one.' But the\nperson who plays the part of K _ri_ sh _n_ a pays no heed to this noise and\nturmoil, and goes on complacently chatting and smoking\n\np. 178\n\nin the green-room behind the stage. But as soon as the noise ceases, and the\npious sage Narada enters on the stage with sweet and soft music and calls upon\nK _ri_ sh _n_ a to come out with a heart overflowing with love, K _ri_ sh _n_\na finds that he can no longer remain indifferent, and hurriedly comes on to\nthe stage. So long as the religious devotee cries, 'Come, O Lord; come, O\nLord,' with lip-prayers only, verily the Lord will never come; when the Lord\ndoes come, the heart of the devotee will melt in divine emotion, and his loud\nutterances will all cease for ever. The Lord cannot delay in coming when man\ncalls upon Him from the depths of his heart overflowing with deep love and\ndevotion.\n\n343\\. There is no Path safer and smoother than that of ba-kalama ( _sic_ ).\nBa-kalama means resigning the self to the will of the Almighty, to have no\nconsciousness that anything is 'mine.'\n\n344\\. What is the nature of absolute reliance? It is that happy state of\ncomfort felt by a fatigued worker, when reclining on a pillow he smokes at\nleisure after a hard day's toil: it is a cessation of all anxieties and\nworries.\n\n345\\. As dry leaves are blown about here and there by the wind, and have no\nchoice of their own, and make no exertion: so those who depend upon God move\nin harmony with His will, and can have no will, and put forth no effort, of\ntheir own.\n\n346, 347. What do you think of the man who is a good orator and preacher, but\nwhose spirituality is undeveloped? He is like a person who squanders another's\nproperty left in\n\np. 179\n\ntrust with him. He can easily advise others, for it costs him nothing, as the\nideas he expresses are not his own, but borrowed.\n\n348\\. A worldly man is best known by his antipathy to whatever savours of\nreligion. He does not like to hear any sacred music or psalm, or to utter the\nholy name of God, and even dissuades others from doing the same. He scoffs at\nprayers, and pours down a volley of abuse upon all religious societies and\nmen.\n\n349\\. As a boy holding on to a post or a pillar gyrates round it with headlong\nspeed without fear of a fall, so, fixing thy hold firmly on God, perform thy\nworldly duties, and thou shalt be free from all dangers.\n\n350\\. As an unchaste woman, busily engaged in household affairs, is all the\nwhile thinking of her secret lover, even so, O thou man of the world, do thy\nround of worldly duties, but fix thy heart always on the Lord.\n\n351\\. As a wet-nurse in a rich family brings up the child of her master,\nloving the baby as if it were her own, but knows well that she has no claim\nupon it; so think ye also that you are but trustees and guardians of your\nchildren whose real father is the Lord God in Heaven.\n\n352\\. It is useless to pore over holy scriptures and sacred Shastras without a\ndiscriminating and dispassionate mind. No spiritual progress can be made\nwithout discrimination (Viveka) and dispassion (Vairagya).\n\n353\\. Know thyself, and thou shalt then know the non-self\n\np. 180\n\nand the Lord of all. What is my ego? Is it my hand, or foot, or flesh, or\nblood, or muscle, or tendon? Ponder deep, and thou shalt know that there is no\nsuch thing as I. As by continually peeling off the skin of the onion, so by\nanalysing the ego it will be found that there is not any real entity\ncorresponding to the ego. The ultimate result of all such analysis is God.\nWhen egoism drops away, Divinity manifests itself.\n\n354\\. The truly devotional and spiritual practice suited for this Iron-age\n(Kali-yuga) is the constant repetition of the name of the Lord of Love.\n\n355\\. If thou wishest to see God, have firm faith in the efficacy of repeating\nthe name of Hari, and try to discriminate the real from the unreal.\n\n356\\. When an elephant is let loose, it goes about uprooting trees and shrubs,\nbut as soon as the driver pricks him on the head with the goad he becomes\nquiet; so the mind when unrestrained wantons in the luxuriance of idle\nthoughts, but becomes calm at once when struck with the goad of\ndiscrimination.\n\n357\\. Devotional practices are necessary only so long as tears of ecstasy do\nnot flow at hearing the name of Hari. He needs no devotional practices whose\nheart is moved to tears at the mere mention of the name of Hari.\n\n358\\. The companionship of the holy and wise is one of the main elements of\nspiritual progress.\n\n359\\. The soul reincarnates in a body of which it was\n\np. 181\n\nthinking just before its last departure from this world. Devotional practices\nmay therefore be seen to be very necessary. When, by constant practice, no\nworldly ideas arise in the mind, then the god-idea alone fills the soul, and\ndoes not leave it even when on the brink of eternity.\n\n360\\. How should one love God? As the true and chaste wife loves her husband\nand the niggardly miser loves his hoarded wealth, so the devotee should love\nthe Lord with all his heart and soul.\n\n361\\. How may we conquer the old Adam in us? When the fruit grows out of the\nflower, the petals of the flower drop off of themselves. So, when the divinity\nin thee increases, the weaknesses of thy human nature will all vanish of their\nown accord.\n\n362, 363. When does the attraction of sensual and worldly pleasures die away?\nIn God, who is Indivisible Ever-Existing Bliss, there is a consolidation of\nall happiness and of all pleasures. They who enjoy Him can find no attraction\nin the cheap and worthless pleasures of the world.\n\n364\\. In what condition of the mind does God-vision take place? God is seen\nwhen the mind is tranquil. When the mental sea is agitated by the wind of\ndesires, it cannot reflect God, and then God-vision is impossible.\n\n365\\. How may we find our God? The angler, anxious to hook a big and beautiful\nRohitta-fish, waits calmly for hours together, having thrown the bait and the\nhook into the water, watching patiently until the bait is caught by the\n\np. 182\n\nfish. Similarly, the devotee who patiently goes on with his devotions is sure\nat last to find his God.\n\n386\\. The heart of a sinner is like a curled hair. You may pull it ever so\nlong, but will not succeed in making it straight. So also the heart of the\nwicked cannot be easily changed.\n\n367\\. Knowledge leads to unity, and Ignorance to diversity.\n\n368, 369. The society of pious men is like the water in which rice is washed.\nThe rice-water dissipates intoxication. So doth the society of the pious\nrelieve worldly men, intoxicated with the wine of desires, from their\nintoxication.\n\n370\\. The agent of a rich Zemindar, when he goes into the mofussil or\ninterior, tyrannises in various ways over the tenants. But when he comes back\nto the head-quarters under the eyes of his master, he changes his ways,\nbecomes very pious, treats the tenants kindly, inquires fully into all their\ngrievances, and tries to mete out impartial justice to all. The tyrannical\nagent even becomes good through the fear of the landlord, and by the effect of\nhis society. Similarly doth the society of the pious make even the wicked\nrighteous, awakening awe and reverence within them.\n\n371\\. Moist wood placed upon a fire soon becomes dry, and ultimately begins to\nburn. Similarly, the society of the pious drives away the moisture of greed\nand lust from the hearts of worldly men and women, and then the fire of Viveka\n(Discrimination) burns in them.\n\np. 183\n\n372\\. How should one pass his or her life? As the fire on the hearth is\nstirred from time to time with a poker to make it burn brightly and prevent it\nfrom going out, so the mind should be invigorated occasionally by the society\nof the pious.\n\n373\\. As the blacksmith keeps alive the fire of his furnace by the occasional\nblowing of his bellows, so the mind should be kept a-burning by the society of\nthe pious.\n\n374\\. Throw an unbaked cake of flour into hot ghee, it will make a sort of\nboiling noise. But the more it is fried, the less becomes the noise; and when\nit is fully fried the bubbling ceases altogether. So long as a man has little\nknowledge, he goes about lecturing and preaching, but when the perfection of\nknowledge is obtained, he ceases to make vain displays.\n\n375\\. That man who, living in the midst of the temptations of the world,\nattains perfection, is the true hero.\n\n376\\. We must dive deep into the ocean of the Eternal-Intelligent-Bliss. Fear\nnot the deep-sea monsters, Avarice and Anger. Coat thyself with the turmeric\nof Discrimination and Dispassion (Viveka and Vairagya) and those alligators\nwill not approach thee, as the scent of this turmeric is too much for them.\n\n377\\. When unavoidably entering into places where there may be temptation,\ncarry always with thee the thought of thy Divine Mother. She will protect thee\nfrom the many evils that may be lurking even in thy heart. Cannot the\n\np. 184\n\npresence of thy mother shame thee away from evil deeds and evil thoughts?\n\n378\\. How may we conquer the love of life? The human frame is made up of\ndecaying things; of flesh and blood and bone. It is a collection of flesh,\nbone, marrow, blood, and other filthy substances subject to putrefaction. By\nthus analysing the body, our love thereof vanishes.\n\n379\\. Should the devotee adopt any particular costume? The adoption of a\nsuitable costume is good. Dressed in the Sa _m_ nyasin's orange robes, or\ncarrying the religious mendicant's tambourine and cymbals, a man can never\nutter light and profane things, or sing profane songs. But a man dressed in\nthe smart style of a beau will naturally have his heart inclined to think low\nthoughts and sing low songs.\n\n380\\. Sometimes peace reigns in the heart, but why does it not always last\nlong? The fire made by the burning of the bamboo is soon extinguished unless\nkept alive by constant blowing. Continual devotion is necessary to keep alive\nthe fire of spirituality.\n\n381\\. Those who live in the world and try to find salvation are like soldiers\nthat fight protected by the breast-work of a fort, while the ascetics who\nrenounce the world in search of God are like soldiers fighting in the open\nfield. To fight from within the fort is safer than to fight in the open field.\n(Is this right or should it be transposed?)\n\n382\\. Pray to the Divine Mother in this wise. Give me,\n\np. 185\n\n[paragraph continues] O Mother! love that knows no incontinence, and faith\nadamantine that cannot be shaken.\n\n383\\. As persons living in a house infested by venomous snakes are always\nalert and cautious, so should men living in the world be always on their guard\nagainst the allurements of lust and greed.\n\n384\\. If there is a small hole in the bottom of a jar of water, the whole\nwater flows out of it by that small aperture. Similarly, if there be the\nsmallest tinge of worldliness in the neophyte, all his exertions come to\nnaught.\n\n385\\. When the butter is produced by churning the whey, it should not be kept\nin the same vessel containing the remaining whey, for then it will lose\nsomething of its sweetness and cohesion. It should be kept in pure water and\nin a different vessel. So after attaining some partial perfection in the\nworld, if one still continues to mix with the worldly, and remains in the\nmidst of the world, it is likely that he will be tainted; but he will remain\npure if he lives out of it.\n\n386\\. You cannot live in a sooty room without blackening your body to some\nextent, however small it may be, with all your caution. So, if a man or a\nwoman lives in the company of one of his or her opposite sex of the same age,\nwith the greatest circumspection and control over his or her passion, still\nsome carnal thought, however small, is sure to arise in his or her mind.\n\n387\\. Two persons, it is said, began together the rite of\n\np. 186\n\ninvoking the Goddess Kali by the terrible process called ' _S_ avasadhana.'\n(This Tantrik invocation is performed in the cemetery yard, the invoker\nsitting on the body of a corpse in a dark night.) One invoker was frightened\nto insanity by the horrors of the earlier portion of the night; the other was\nfavoured with the vision of the Divine Mother at the end of the night. Then he\nasked her, 'Mother! why did the other man become mad?' The Deity answered,\nThou too, O child! didst become mad many times in thy various previous births,\nand now at last thou seest me.'\n\n388\\. There are various sects among the Hindus; which sect or which creed\nshould we then adopt? Parvati once asked Mahadeva, 'O Lord! what is the root\nof the Eternal, Everlasting, All-embracing Bliss?' To her Mahadeva thus\nreplied, 'The root is faith.' The peculiarities of creeds and sects matter\nlittle or nothing. Let every one perform with faith the devotions and the\nduties of his own creed.\n\n389\\. As a little boy or a girl can have no idea of conjugal affection, even\nso a worldly man cannot at all comprehend the ecstasy of Divine communion.\n\n390\\. The body is transient and unimportant. Why then is it so much looked\nafter? No one cares for an empty box. But people carefully preserve the box\nthat contains money and other valuable property. The virtuous cannot but take\ncare of the body, the temple of the soul in which God has manifested Himself\nor which has been blessed by God's advent.\n\np. 187\n\n391\\. How long does godliness remain in man? The iron is red so long as it is\nin fire. It is black the moment it is removed from fire. So the human being is\ngodly so long as he is in communion with God.\n\n392\\. Soft clay admits of forms, but the burnt clay does not. So those whose\nhearts are consumed with the desire of worldly things cannot realise higher\nideas.\n\n393\\.
