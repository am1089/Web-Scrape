They put fire-wood on (the \xc3\x82havaniya fire), and prepare the\nunderlayer (of gravel 2). He (the Adhvaryu) puts the butter on (the Garhapatya\nto melt), and cleans both the dipping-spoon and the offering-spoon. Having\nthen clarified the ghee, he ladles five times thereof (into the offering-\nspoon). When the fire-wood is ablaze-\n\n3:5:2:22\\. They lift the (burning) fire-wood, and place it on the underlayer\n3. Thereupon he says (to the Hot _ri_ ), 'Recite for Agni as he is taken\nforward 4!' (and to the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ), 'Come up after me with the\nsingle sword(-line)!' The Pratiprasthat _ri_ goes up after him with the single\nsword(-line) as far\n\np. 122\n\nas that middle peg on the hind-part of the altar 1: whatever part of the\nGarhapatya 2 is cut off from the altar by that intermediate (peg), that he\nthereby carries on to (connects with) it.\n\n3:5:2:33\\. Now some walk up behind (and draw a line) as far as the high altar;\nbut let him not do that: let him walk up only as far as that middle peg. They\nproceed and come up to the high altar 3.\n\n3:5:2:44\\. The Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water. He first sprinkles (the\nhigh altar) in front, while standing (south of it) facing the north, with the\ntext (Va _g_. S. V, 11), 'May Indra's noise 4 shield thee in front with the\nVasus!' whereby he means to say, 'May Indra's noise protect thee in front with\nthe Vasus.'\n\n3:5:2:55\\. He then sprinkles it behind with, 'May the Wise 5 shield thee from\nbehind with the Rudras!' whereby he means to say, 'May the Wise One protect\nthee from behind with the Rudras!'\n\n3:5:2:66\\. He then sprinkles on the right (south) side with, 'May the Thought-\nswift shield thee with the Fathers on the right!' whereby he means\n\np. 123\n\nto say, 'May he swift as thought 1 protect thee on the right with the\nFathers!'\n\n3:5:2:77\\. He then sprinkles on the left side with, 'May Vi _s_ vakarman (the\nAll-shaper) shield thee with the \xc3\x82dityas on the left!' whereby he means to\nsay, 'May Vi _s_ vakarman protect thee on the left with the \xc3\x82dityas!'\n\n3:5:2:88\\. The sprinkling-water which is left he pours outside the altar close\nto where is the southern of those two front corners (of the high altar) with,\n'This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice.' Because she (Va _k_ \\--the\naltar) on that occasion became a lioness and roamed about unappeased 2, he\nthus dismisses from the sacrifice that sorrow of hers,--if he do not wish to\nexorcise. But should he wish to exorcise, let him indicate it by saying, 'This\nburning water I dismiss from the sacrifice against so and so!' He then smites\nhim with that sorrow, and sorrowing he goes to yonder world.\n\n3:5:2:99\\. Now as to why he pours ghee on the high altar, while the fire is\nheld (over it). Because the gods said to her on that occasion, 'The offering\nshall reach thee before Agni,' therefore the offering now does reach her\nbefore (it reaches) Agni. And because she said to the gods, 'Whatsoever\nblessing ye will invoke through me, all that shall be accomplished unto you!'\ntherefore the priests now invoke through her that blessing upon the\nsacrificer, and it is fully accomplished unto him.\n\n3:5:2:1010\\. When he pours ghee on the high altar, he\n\np. 124\n\ndoes it twofold even while doing it in one 1. Now that which is the southern\nof the two front corners of that navel, so to say, which is in the middle of\nthese (sides of the high altar)--\n\n3:5:2:1111\\. On that 2 he pours ghee, with the text (Va _g_. S. V, 12), 'Thou\nart a lioness; Hail!' Then on the northern of the two back corners with, 'Thou\nart a lioness, winning the \xc3\x82dityas 3, Hail!' Then on the southern of the two\nback corners with, 'Thou art a lioness, winning the Brahman, winning the\nKshatra, Hail!' Manifold, verily, is the prayer for blessing in the\nsacrificial texts: by this one he prays 4 for the Brahman (priesthood) and the\nKshatra. (nobility), those two vital forces.\n\n3:5:2:1212\\. Then on the northern of the front corners with, 'Thou art a\nlioness, winning abundant offspring, winning growth of wealth, Hail!' In that\nhe says, 'winning abundant offspring,' he prays for offspring; and in that he\nsays, 'winning growth of wealth'--growth of wealth meaning abundance--he prays\nfor abundance.\n\n3:5:2:1313\\. He then pours ghee into the middle with, 'Thou art a lioness,\nbring thou hither the gods for the sacrificer! Hail!' whereby he causes the\ngods to be brought to the sacrificer. He then raises the offering-spoon with,\n'To the\n\np. 125\n\nbeings thee! Hail!'--beings meaning offspring--he thereby means to say, 'To\noffspring thee!'\n\n3:5:2:1414\\. He then lays the enclosing-sticks 1 round (the navel); with the\ntext (Va _g_. S. V, 13), 'Thou art firm, steady thou the earth!' the middle\none; with, 'Thou art firmly settled, steady thou the air!' the right one;\nwith, 'Thou art immovably settled, steady thou the sky!' the left one. With,\n'Thou art Agni's provision' he throws the 'equipments' upon (the high altar).\nWherefore are the equipments?--for Agni's completeness.\n\n3:5:2:1515\\. The pine-wood, namely, is his body 2: hence in that there are\nenclosing-sticks of pine-wood, thereby he supplies him with a body, makes him\nwhole.\n\n3:5:2:1616\\. And the bdellium, forsooth, is his flesh: hence in that there is\nbdellium, thereby he supplies him with flesh, makes him whole.\n\n3:5:2:1717\\. And the fragrant reed-grass (sugandhi-te _g_ ana), forsooth, is\nhis fragrance: hence in that there is fragrant reed-grass, thereby he supplies\nhim with fragrance, makes him whole.\n\n3:5:2:1818\\. And as to why there is a wether's hair-tuft,--Agni, forsooth,\ndwelt once for one night between the two horns of a wether: 'Whatever of\nAgni's nature is inherent therein, let that be here too,' so he thinks, and\ntherefore there is a wether's hair-tuft. Let him, therefore, cut off that\n(tuft) which is nearest to the head, and bring it; and if he be unable to\nprocure that, let him bring any kind (of wether's hair). And why there are\nenclosing-sticks?--for the\n\np. 126\n\nprotection (of Agni): for it is somewhat long before the next enclosing-sticks\nwill come nigh to him 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[121:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_323) The transferring of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire to the high\naltar takes place in the forenoon of the last Upasad day (that is, on the day\npreceding the pressing day, and called upavasatha, or preparation day). It is\npreceded by the double or combined performance of the Upasad offerings (one of\nwhich took place in the afternoon on the two preceding days).\n\n[121:2](sbe2620.htm#fr_324) Some gravel is put in a pan for the burning wood\nto lie upon, when it is to be transferred from the \xc3\x82havaniya to the new altar.\nThe Taittiriyas mix with the gravel one-fourth part of the dust of the foot-\nprint of the Soma-cow ([III, 3, 1, 6](sbe2611.htm#3:3:1:6)), the other three\nparts being used respectively for anointing the axle of the Soma-cart ([III,\n5, 3, 13](sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:13)), for the underlayer of the \xc3\x82gnidhra fire\n([III, 6, 3, 4](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:4)), and for scattering about behind the\nGarhapatya ([III, 6, 3, 4](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:4)-[7](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:7)).\n\n[121:3](sbe2620.htm#fr_325) Lit. they lift the underlayer underneath (the\nburning wood).\n\n[121:4](sbe2620.htm#fr_326) For the eight verses (or twelve, the first and\nlast being recited thrice each) which the Hot _ri_ has to repeat while the\nfire is carried eastward and laid down on the high altar, see Ait. Br. I, 28;\n\xc3\x82 _s_ v. Sr. II, 17. For the Brahman's duties, see Katy. XI, 1, 9.\n\n[122:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_327) See [III, 5, 1, 1](sbe2619.htm#3:5:1:1).\n\n[122:2](sbe2620.htm#fr_328) The \xc3\x82havaniya or offering fire being now\ntransferred to the new altar, the old \xc3\x82havaniya hearth is henceforward used as\nGarhapatya; and a line is drawn from it up to the anta _h_ pata, marking the\nmiddle of the west side of the great altar.\n\n[122:3](sbe2620.htm#fr_329) In 'leading forwards' the fire they proceed along\nthe north side of the large altar.\n\n[122:4](sbe2620.htm#fr_330) Indraghosha, perhaps 'India's name;' Mahidhara and\nSaya _n_ a take it as 'he who is noised abroad as Indra' (i.e. called Indra),\nwhich, however, would require the accent 'indraghosha.' Perhaps 'the noise of\nIndra' means Agni, the roaring fire: for Agni and the Vasus, see [III, 4, 2,\n1](sbe2616.htm#3:4:2:1).\n\n[122:5](sbe2620.htm#fr_331) Pra _k_ etas, here Varu _n_ a according to\nMahidhara and Saya _n_ a. Cf. [III, 4, 2, 1](sbe2616.htm#3:4:2:1).\n\n[123:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_332) 'Mano _g_ avas' is taken by Mahidhara and Saya _n_\na as referring to Yama.\n\n[123:2](sbe2620.htm#fr_333) ' _S_ o _k_ anti (sorrowing),' Ka _n_ va rec.\n\n[124:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_334) Viz. by pouring the ghee cross-wise on the corners\nof the 'navel' of the altar.\n\n[124:2](sbe2620.htm#fr_335) The south-east is sacred to Agni, the north-west\nto Vayu.\n\n[124:3](sbe2620.htm#fr_336) Because the \xc3\x82dityas brought her as a Dakshi _n_ a,\nKa _n_ va rec.; cf. [III, 5, 1, 18](sbe2619.htm#3:5:1:18).\n\n[124:4](sbe2620.htm#fr_337) But for the lack of a demonstrative pronoun with a\n_s_ i _h_ one would like to take the passage thus: 'Plenteous, forsooth, is\nthis prayer for blessing among sacrificial texts: he thereby prays for the\npriesthood and the nobility.' Cf. I, 2, 1, 7.\n\n[125:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_338) They are of pitudaru (Pinus Deodora) wood, a span\n(of thumb and fore-finger) long.\n\n[125:2](sbe2620.htm#fr_339) The Ka _n_ va text makes it his bones.\n\n[126:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_340) Ordinarily the laying round of the paridhis takes\nplace immediately before the fire is kindled for the offering; but as the next\noffering is not to come off for some time, the fire would be without a\nprotection, if he were to leave it without the enclosing-sticks. Saya _n_ a\ntakes 'dure' in the sense of 'in a long time,' as above; but it might be taken\nof space 'far off,' when the passage would refer to the offering about to be\nperformed on the old \xc3\x82havaniya ([III, 5, 3, 10](sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:10) seq.);\nand it may be noticed in reference to this point, that, according to Katy.\nVIII, 3, 30, that fire does not become the Garhapatya till immediately after\nthat offering.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 5, 3.
