The non-abandonment of the promissory statements (results only) from the\nnon-difference (of the entire world from Brahman), according to the words of\nthe Veda.\n\nIn all the Vedanta-texts we meet with promissory statements of the following\nnature:--'That by which we hear what is not heard, perceive what is not\nperceived, know what is not known' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 1, 3); 'When the Self has\nbeen seen, heard, perceived, and known, then all this is known' (B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 5, 6); 'Sir, what is that through which if it is known everything else\nbecomes known?' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 3); 'Outside that which is there is no\nknowledge.' These promissory statements are not abandoned, i.e. not\nstultified, only if the entire aggregate of things is non-different from\nBrahman, the object of knowledge; for if there were any difference, the\naffirmation that by the knowledge of one thing everything is known, would be\ncontradicted thereby. Non-difference again of the two is possible only if the\nwhole aggregate of things originates from the one Brahman. And we understand\nfrom the words of the Veda that that affirmation can be established only\nthrough the theory of the non-difference of the material cause and its\neffects. For the affirmation contained in the clause 'That by which we hear\nwhat is not heard,' &c., is proved by the analogous instances of clay, &c.,\nwhich all aim at showing the identity of effect and cause. In order to\nestablish this, the subsequent clauses also ('Being only, my dear, this was in\nthe beginning, one only, without a second; it thought; it sent forth fire,'\n&c.) at first state that the aggregate of effects belongs to Brahman, and then\ndeclare its identity with Brahman, viz. from the passage 'In it all that\nexists has its Self' (VI, 8, 7), up to the end of the prapa _th_ aka.--If,\nnow, the ether were not one of the effects of Brahman, it could not be known\nby Brahman being known, and that would involve an abandonment of a (previous)\naffirmation; an\n\np. 10\n\nalternative which, as invalidating the authoritativeness of the Veda, is of\ncourse altogether unacceptable.--Similarly in all the Vedanta-texts certain\npassages are to be found which, by means of various instances, make the same\naffirmation, so e.g. 'This everything, all is that Self' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4,\n6); 'Brahman alone is that Immortal before' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11).--Hence, like\nfire and the other substances, the ether also is a product.--The averment made\nby the purvapakshin that on account of the absence of scriptural statements\nthe ether is not a product is unfounded, since a scriptural passage referring\nto the origin of ether has already been pointed out, viz. 'from that Self\nsprang ether.'--True,--the purvapakshin may reply,--such a statement has\nindeed been pointed out, but it is contradicted by another statement, viz. 'It\nsent forth fire,' &c. Should it be alleged that there can be no contradiction,\nbecause all scriptural passages form one whole, the reply is that all non-\ncontradictory passages form a whole; in the present case, however, a\ncontradiction has been shown to exist, because the creator, who is mentioned\nonly once, cannot be connected with two things created; because two things\ncannot both be created first; and because an option is, in that case,\ninadmissible 1.--This reply, we rejoin, is without force. It is indeed true\nthat it is impossible to explain the passage of the Taittiriyaka in any\nmodified sense; for it distinctly declares that fire was produced in the third\nplace, 'From that Self sprang the ether, from ether air, from air fire.' But,\non the other hand, it is possible to give a different turn to the passage from\nthe _Kh_ andogya, which may be explained to mean that 'Brahman, after having\ncreated ether and air, created fire.' For as the purport of this passage is to\nrelate the origin of fire, it cannot at the same time impugn the account of\nthe origin of ether given in another passage; according to the principle that\nto one and the same sentence a double purport must not be ascribed. As, on the\n\np. 11\n\nother hand, one creator may successively create more than one thing, and as on\nthat ground the combination of the two passages into one syntactical whole is\npossible, we are not obliged to disregard any scriptural statement on account\nof its meaning being contradicted (by other scriptural passages). Nor do we\nmean to say that a creator mentioned only once is to be connected with two\ncreated things; for the other (second) created thing is supplied from another\nscriptural passage. And, in the same way as the fact of the whole aggregate of\nthings being produced from Brahman--which is stated directly in the passage\n'Let a man meditate with calm mind on that as beginning, ending and breathing\nin it' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 1)--does not impugn the order of creation stated\nelsewhere to begin with fire; so also the statement as to fire being produced\nfrom Brahman has no force to impugn the order of creation which, in another\nscriptural passage, is said to begin with ether.\n\nBut, it may be objected, the passage 'Let a man meditate with calm mind,' &c.\nhas the purpose of enjoining calmness, and does not state anything with regard\nto creation; it need not therefore adapt itself to the order (of creation)\nestablished by another passage 1. On the other hand, the passage 'It sent\nforth fire' refers to the creation, and we must therefore accept the order\nexactly as stated there.--This objection we refute by the remark that it is\nnot legitimate to abandon, from deference to the circumstance of fire\noccupying the first place (in the _Kh_. Up.), the thing, viz. the ether which\nis known (to have been created) from another passage; for order of succession\nis a mere attribute of things (and therefore subordinate to the latter).\nMoreover, in the passage 'It sent forth fire' we meet with no word directly\nindicating the order of succession; but we merely infer the latter from the\nsense, and this (merely inferred) order is impugned by the order established\nby another direct scriptural statement,\n\np. 12\n\nviz. 'From air there sprang fire.' Now with regard to the question whether\nether or fire were created first, neither option nor addition are permissible,\nbecause the former is impossible in itself, and the latter non-admitted by the\ntexts 1. Hence the two scriptural passages are not contradictory.--Moreover,\nin order to justify the promise made in the _Kh_ andogya in the beginning of\nthe chapter ('That instruction by which we hear what is not heard'), we have\nto count the ether, although 'not heard' (i.e. not mentioned in the text)\namong the things produced; how much more impossible then is it for us not to\naccept the statement actually made about the ether in the Taittiriyaka!--To\nthe assertion, made above by the purvapakshin, that the ether as occupying the\nsame space with everything is known together with Brahman and its effects, and\nthat thus the assertion (of everything being known through Brahman) is not\ncontradicted; and that moreover the scriptural passage 'one only, without a\nsecond' is not contradicted, because Brahman and the ether may be considered\nas non-separate, like milk and water, we make the following reply. That\nknowledge of everything through the knowledge of one thing (of which scripture\nspeaks) cannot be explained through the analogy of milk mixed with water,\nbecause we understand from the parallel instance of a piece of clay being\nbrought forward ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 1, 4) that the knowledge of everything has to\nbe explained through the relation of the material cause and the material\neffect (the knowledge of the cause implying the knowledge of the effect).\nMoreover, the knowledge of everything, if assumed to be analogous to the case\nof the knowledge of milk and water, could not be called a perfect knowledge\n(samyag-vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana), because the water which is\n\np. 13\n\napprehended only through the knowledge of the milk (with which it is mixed) is\nnot grasped by perfect knowledge 1. Nor can Vedic affirmations about things be\nviewed, like ordinary human statements, as mixed up with error, untruth, and\ndeceit 2. And we should do violence to the emphatic assertion made in the\npassage 'one only, without a second,' if we explained it according to the\nanalogy of milk mixed with water.--Nor must we explain the cognition of\neverything (through one thing), and the assertion as to the one without a\nsecond, as referring only to a part of existing things, viz. the avowed\neffects of Brahman (to the exclusion of ether), on the ground that such is the\ncase in the parallel instances of clay and the like. For what is said about\nclay and the like is not something altogether new and independent; but has to\nbe understood in connexion with the previous passage ' _S_ vetaketu, as you\nare so conceited,' &c. We therefore must conclude that the 'knowledge of\neverything' has all things whatever for its objects, and is here introduced\nwith a view to showing that everything is the effect of Brahman.\n\nThe next Sutra replies to the assertion, made by the purvapakshin, that the\npassage which speaks of the origin of ether is to be understood in a secondary\nsense, on account of the impossibility (of ether having an origin).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[10:1](sbe38007.htm#fr_3) For we cannot maintain that optionally either the\none or the other was created first.\n\n[11:1](sbe38007.htm#fr_4) Yatpara _h_ _s_ abda _h_ _s_ abdartho na _k_ aya _m_\n_s_ abda _h_ s _ri_ sh _t_ iparo\xe0\xa4\xbdto na prasiddha _m_ kramam badhitum alam iti.\n\xc3\x82n. Gi.\n\n[12:1](sbe38007.htm#fr_5) An optional proceeding, i.e. the doctrine that\neither ether or fire was the first product is impossible because only actions\nto be done, not existing things, fall within the sphere of option; addition,\ni.e. the fact of fire and ether together being the first creation is not\nadmitted by scripture, which teaches a successive creation of the elements.\n\n[13:1](sbe38007.htm#fr_6) For the water, although mixed with the milk, yet is\ndifferent from it.\n\n[13:2](sbe38007.htm#fr_7) But the promise that through the knowledge of one\nthing everything becomes known is to be taken in its full literal meaning.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 6](sbe38008.htm)\n\n"
