He said to him, 'Knowing what 3, hast thou come to me?'--'Agni (the\nfire) I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'Speech.'--'What becomes of him who\nknows that Agni?'--'He becomes eloquent 4,' he said, 'speech does not fail\nhim.'\n\np. 332\n\n10:3:3:22\\. 'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what (else) hast thou come\nto me?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Eye.'--'What becomes\nof him who knows that Agni?'--'He becomes seeing,' he said; his eye does not\nfail him.'\n\n10:3:3:33\\. 'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what hast thou come to\nme?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Mind.'--'What becomes of\nhim who knows that Agni?'--'He becomes thoughtful,' he said; 'his mind does\nnot fail him.'\n\n10:3:3:44\\. 'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what hast thou come to\nme?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Ear.'--'What becomes of\nhim who knows that Agni?'--'He becomes hearing,' he said; 'his ear does not\nfail him.'\n\n10:3:3:55\\. 'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what hast thou come to\nme?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Agni who is everything\nhere, him I know.'--On (hearing) this said, he stepped down to him and said,\n'Teach me that Agni, sir!'\n\n10:3:3:66\\. He said,--Verily, that Agni is the breath; for when man sleeps,\nspeech passes into the breath, and so do the eye, the mind, and the ear; and\nwhen he awakes, they again issue from the breath. Thus much as to the body.\n\n10:3:3:77\\. Now as to the deity. That speech verily is Agni himself; and that\neye is yonder sun; and that\n\np. 333\n\nmind is that moon; and that ear is the quarters; and that breath is the wind\nthat blows here.\n\n10:3:3:88\\. Now, when that fire goes out, it is wafted up in the wind (air),\nwhence people say of it, 'It has expired 1,' for it is wafted up in the wind.\nAnd when the sun sets it enters the wind, and so does the moon; and the\nquarters are established in the wind, and from out of the wind they issue\nagain. And when he who knows this passes away from this world, he passes into\nthe fire by his speech, into the sun by his eye, into the moon by his mind,\ninto the quarters by his ear, and into the wind by his breath; and being\ncomposed thereof, he becomes whichever of these deities he chooses, and is at\nrest.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[331:2](sbe4358.htm#fr_644) Literally, one who keeps a large house, a lord.\nSaya _n_ a, however, treats it as a proper name.\n\n[331:3](sbe4358.htm#fr_645) That is, 'with what knowledge.'\n\n[331:4](sbe4358.htm#fr_646) Or, perhaps, possessed of a good voice.
