The Veda declares that the hand of an artisan is always pure, so is every\nvendible commodity exposed for sale and food obtained by begging, which a\nstudent holds in. his hand. 1\n\n2\\. A calf is pure on the flowing (of the milk), a bird on the fall of the\nfruit, women at the time of dalliance, and a dog when he catches a deer. 2\n\n3\\. All mines and places of manufacture are pure excepting distilleries of\nspirituous liquor; continuously flowing streams of water and dust raised by\nthe wind cannot be contaminated. 3\n\n4\\. The flowers and fruit of flowering and fruit-bearing trees which grow in\nunclean places are likewise not impure.\n\np. 171\n\n5\\. On touching a tree standing on a sacred spot, a funeral pile, a\nsacrificial post, a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala or a person who sells the Veda, a Brahma\n_n_ a shall bathe dressed in his clothes. 5\n\n6\\. One's own couch, seat, clothes, wife, child, and waterpot are pure for\noneself; but for strangers they are impure.\n\n7\\. A seat, a couch, a vehicle, ships (and boats), the road and grass are\npurified by the wind, if they have been touched by _K_ a _n_ _d_ alas or\noutcasts. 7\n\n8\\. Grain on the threshing-floor, water in wells and reservoirs, and milk in\nthe cowpen are fit for use even (if they come) from a person whose food must\nnot be eaten. 8\n\n9\\. The gods created for Brahma _n_ as three means of purification, (viz.)\nignorance of defilement, sprinkling with water, and commending by word of\nmouth. 9\n\n10\\. Water collected on the ground with which 10\n\np. 172\n\ncows slake their thirst is a means of purification, provided it is not\nstrongly mixed with unclean (substances), nor has a (bad) smell, nor is\ndiscoloured, nor has a (bad) taste.\n\n11\\. But land becomes pure, according to the degree of the defilement, by\nsweeping the (defiled) spot, by sprinkling it with water, by smearing it with\ncowdung, by scattering (pure earth) on it, or by scraping it. 11\n\n12\\. Now they quote also (the following verse):\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[170:1](sbe1442.htm#fr_856) **9**. Vish _n_ u XXIII, 48.\n\n[170:2](sbe1442.htm#fr_857) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 49.\n\n[170:3](sbe1442.htm#fr_858) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 48. The term akara, translated\nby 'mines and places of manufacture,' is explained in the commentary by\n'places of production, i.e. of sugar and honey.' It is no doubt intended to\napply to any place where articles of consumption or use are produced. Govinda\nadds that as 'continuous streams of water' are always pure, one must take care\nthat the water for sipping flows out of the vessel in an unbroken stream.\n\n[171:5](sbe1442.htm#fr_859) Vasish _th_ a IV, 37. _K_ aityav _ri_ ksha, 'a\ntree standing on sacred ground,' means literally, 'a memorial-tree.'\n\n[171:7](sbe1442.htm#fr_860) Govinda points out that couches and seats and the\nlike, on which _K_ a _n_ _d_ alas and outcasts have lain or sat down, must be\npurified.\n\n[171:8](sbe1442.htm#fr_861) 'That must be referred to grain on a threshing-\nfloor, and so forth, which has been produced by men whose food must not be\neaten, and again is considered to be common to all. In this case, too, what\nhas been received from outcasts and _K_ a _n_ _d_ alas, that is defiled. Milk\nwhich has been received just at milking-time may be drunk out of a vessel that\nstands in the cowpen.'--Govinda. As regards the grain produced by low-caste\npeople, the rule probably refers to cases where the land of an Agrahara or\nother village is cultivated by men of the lowest castes. The author means to\nsay that in such cases a Brahma _n_ a may take his share from the threshing-\nfloor, where the whole produce of the village-land is stored, without\nhesitation.\n\n[171:9](sbe1442.htm#fr_862) Vasish _th_ a XIV, 24; Manu V, 127.\n\n[171:10](sbe1442.htm#fr_863) Vasish _th_ a III, 35-36.\n\n[172:11](sbe1442.htm#fr_864) Vasish _th_ a III, 56.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 5, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 10](sbe1443.htm)\n\n"
