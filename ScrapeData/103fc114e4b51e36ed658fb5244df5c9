The story is told to R\xc4\x81ma by the\nhermit\n\np. 461\n\n[paragraph continues] Visvamitra, as he was travelling with R\xc4\x81ma and his\nbrother Lakshman. As soon as they reach the banks of the sacred stream,\n\n"They bathed, as Scripture bids, and paid  \n Oblations due to god and shade."\n\nAs soon as they were seated, R\xc4\x81ma said-\n\n            "\'O saint, I yearn  \n The three-pathed Gang\xc4\x81\'s tale to learn.  \n Thus urged, the saint recounted both  \n The birth of Gang\xc4\x81 and her growth:  \n The mighty hill with metals stored,  \n Him\xc4\x81laya, is, the mountains\' lord,  \n The father of a lovely pair  \n Of daughters, fairest of the fair.  \n Their mother, offspring of the will  \n Of Meru, everlasting hill,  \n Mena, Him\xc4\x81laya\'s darling, graced  \n With beauty of her dainty waist.  \n Gang\xc4\x81 was elder-born; then came  \n The fair one known by Um\xc4\x81\'s name.  \n Then all the gods of heaven, in need  \n Of Gang\xc4\x81\'s help their vows to speed,  \n To great Him\xc4\x81laya came and prayed  \n The mountain king to yield the maid.  \n He, not regardless of the weal  \n Of the three worlds, with holy zeal  \n His daughter to the Immortals gave--  \n Gang\xc4\x81, whose waters cleanse and save,  \n Who roams at pleasure, fair and free,  \n Purging all sinners, to the sea.  \n The three-pathed Gang\xc4\x81 thus obtained,  \n The gods their heavenly homes regained.\'" *\n\nThe sage next tells R\xc4\x81ma that there was a mighty King of Ayodha named S\xc4\x81gara \xe2\x80\xa0\nwho, being childless,\n\np. 462\n\nand most anxious to have a son, propitiated the saint Bhrigu (or, according to\nother accounts, his grandson) by penances extending over a hundred years. At\nlength the saint, pleased with S\xc4\x81gara\'s worship, said--\n\n"From thee, O S\xc4\x81gar, blameless king,  \n A mighty host of sons shall spring,  \n And thou shalt win a glorious name,  \n Which none, O chief, but thou shalt claim;  \n One of thy queens a son shall bear,  \n Maintainer of thy race and heir;  \n And of the other there shall be  \n Some sixty thousand born to thee." *\n\nHearing this, the wives are anxious to know which of them is to have the one\nson, and which the multitude; but this the Br\xc4\x81hman leaves them to decide.\nKesini wishes for the one; and Sumati is pleased with the prospect of having\nsixty thousand.\n\n"Time passed. The elder consort bare  \n A son called Ansum\xc4\x81n, the heir.\n\np. 463\n\n[paragraph continues]  Then Sumati, the younger, gave  \n Birth to a gourd, O hero brave,  \n Whose rind, when burst and cleft in two,  \n Gave sixty thousand babes to view.  \n All these with care the nurses laid  \n In jars of oil; and there they stayed,  \n Till, youthful age and strength complete,  \n Forth speeding from each dark retreat,  \n All peers in valour, years, and might,  \n The sixty thousand came to light." *\n\nAfter a time King S\xc4\x81gara determined to make an Asvamedha, or horse sacrifice,\nwith the object of becoming the reigning Indra, or king of the gods.\nPreparations for this are accordingly made, and Prince Ansum\xc4\x81n, the son of the\nelder wife, is appointed by the king to follow the horse set apart for the\nsacrifice; for, according to the ritual, it was to be set free, and allowed to\nwander for a whole year wherever it would. Indra, knowing the great merit that\nS\xc4\x81gar would obtain by this sacrifice, and fearing that he might even lose his\ncrown,\n\n"Veiling his form in demon guise,  \n Came down upon the appointed day,  \n And drove the victim horse away." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe officiating priest, being aware of this, cries out--\n\n"Haste, king! now let the thief be slain;  \n Bring thou the charger back again;  \n The sacred rite prevented thus  \n Brings scathe and woe to all of us."\n\nKing S\xc4\x81gara, incited by the Br\xc4\x81hman, urges his sons to search until they find\nthe stolen horse:\n\n"Brave sons of mine, I know not how  \n These demons are so mighty now;\n\np. 464\n\n[paragraph continues]  The priests began the rites so well,  \n All sanctified with prayer and spell.  \n If in the depths of earth he hide,  \n Or lurk beneath the ocean\'s tide,  \n Pursue, dear sons, the robber\'s track;  \n Slay him and bring the charger back.  \n The whole of this broad earth explore,  \n Sea-garlanded from shore to shore;  \n Yea, dig her up with might and main,  \n Until you see the horse again." *\n\nThe sons commence their search. Each digs a league in depth, and by this means\nthey reach the centre of the earth; but cannot see the horse. Alarmed at their\ndestructive work, the gods repair to Brahm\xc4\x81, and tell him what is happening.\nHe cheers them with the information that Vishnu, in the form of Kapila, will\nprotect the Earth, his bride, and that these sons of S\xc4\x81gara will be consumed\nto ashes. The gods, encouraged by these words, repair to their home and\npatiently wait for deliverance.\n\nAfter digging sixty thousand leagues into the earth without obtaining any\ntidings of the horse, the princes return to their father, asking what can be\ndone. S\xc4\x81gara commands them to dig on, and continue their search until the\nhorse is found. At length they\n\n"Saw V\xc4\x81sudeva (Vishnu) standing there.  \n In Kapil\'s form he loved to wear;  \n And near the everlasting God  \n The victim charger cropped the sod.  \n They saw with joy and eager eyes  \n The fancied robber and the prize,  \n And on him rushed the furious band,  \n Crying aloud, \'Stand, villain! Stand!\'\n\np. 465\n\n\'Avaunt! avaunt!\' great Kapil cried,  \n His bosom flusht with passion\'s tide;  \n Then, by his might, that proud array  \n All scorched to heaps of ashes lay." *,\n\nHearing no news of his sons, the king became anxious, and sent his grandson\nAnsum\xc4\x81n to look after them. He inquires of all he meets on the earth, and is\nencouraged by the information that he shall certainly bring back the stolen\nhorse. At length he reaches the spot where his brothers were consumed, and is\noverwhelmed with grief at their fate. At this moment his uncle Garuda appears\nand consoles him, saying--\n\n"Grieve not, O hero, for their fall,  \n Who died a death approved of all.  \n Of mighty strength they met their fate  \n By Kapil\'s hand, whom none can mate.  \n Pour forth for them no earthly wave,  \n A holier flood their spirits crave.  \n If, daughter of the Lord of Snow,  \n Gang\xc4\x81 would turn her stream below,  \n Her waves, that cleanse all mortal stain,  \n Would wash their ashes pure again.  \n Yea, when her flood, whom all revere,  \n Rolls o\'er the dust that moulders here,  \n The sixty thousand, freed from sin,  \n A home in Indra\'s heaven shall win.  \n Go, and with ceaseless labours try  \n To draw the goddess from the sky.  \n Return, and with thee take the steed;  \n So shall thy grandsire\'s rite succeed." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe prince takes the steed; the sacrifice is completed, and for 30,000 years\nKing S\xc4\x81gara was thinking how he could induce Gang\xc4\x81 to come down from heaven.\nAt length, not having succeeded in forming a successful plan, the monarch\nhimself went to heaven. Ansum\xc4\x81n\n\np. 466\n\nreigned in his stead, who, in his turn, tried to find some means of liberating\nhis brothers. His son Dilipa also made a similar, but equally unsuccessful,\neffort. It was given to Dilipa\'s son Bhagirath to accomplish this work.\nBhagirath had no son. He, in order to obtain this boon, and also to free his\nkinsmen from their sad fate, practised most severe austerities, until at\nlength Brahm\xc4\x81 said--\n\n"Blest monarch, of a glorious race,  \n Thy fervent rites have won my grace.  \n Well hast thou wrought thine awful task:  \n Some boon in turn, O hermit, ask." *\n\nTo which Bhagirath replies as follows--\n\n"Let S\xc4\x81gar\'s sons receive from me  \n Libations that they long to see.  \n Let Gang\xc4\x81 with her holy wave  \n The ashes of the heroes lave,  \n That so my kinsmen may ascend  \n To heavenly bliss that ne\'er shall end.  \n And give, I pray, O god, a son,  \n Nor let my house be all undone."\n\nTo this the god replies--\n\n       "As thou prayest, it shall be.  \n Gang\xc4\x81, whose waves in Swarga (Heaven) flow,  \n Is daughter of the Lord of Snow.  \n Win Siva, that his aid be lent  \n To hold her in her mid descent,  \n For earth alone will never bear  \n These torrents hurled from upper air." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nBrahm\xc4\x81 then re-ascended to the skies; but Bhagirath remained for a whole\nyear--\n\n"With arms upraised, refusing rest,  \n While with one toe the earth he prest."\n\np. 467\n\nSiva, pleased with this devotion, promised to sustain the shock of the descent\nof the waters on his head; but Gang\xc4\x81 was not at all pleased when commanded to\ndescend to earth:\n\n"\'He calls me,\' in her wrath she cried,  \n \'And all my flood shall sweep  \n And whirl him in its whelming tide  \n To hell\'s profoundest deep.\'" *\n\nSiva, however, was a match for the wrathful deity. He held her in the coils of\nhis hair until her anger abated, and then she fell into the Vindu lake, from\nwhence proceed the seven sacred streams of India. This lake is not known; and\nof the seven streams mentioned, two only are familiar to geographers, the\nGanges and the Indus. One branch of this stream followed Bhagirath wherever he\nwent. On the way the waters flooded the sacrificial flame of Jahnu, a saint.\nIn his anger he drank up its waters, and Bhagirath\'s work seemed to be\nfruitless. But at the intercession of the king and Brahm\xc4\x81, the saint allowed\nthe waters to flow from his ears. From this fact one of the many names of\nGang\xc4\x81 is J\xc4\x81hnavi, or daughter of Jahnu. At length Bhagirath reached the ocean,\nand descending to the depths where S\xc4\x81gara\'s sons were lying, Gang\xc4\x81 followed\nuntil her waters touched the ashes, when--\n\n"Soon as the flood their dust bedewed,  \n Their spirits gained beatitude,  \n And all in heavenly bodies dressed  \n Rose to the skies\' eternal rest." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nAs a reward for his meritorious work, Brahm\xc4\x81\' said to him--\n\n"Long as the ocean\'s flood shall stand  \n Upon the border of the land,\n\np. 468\n\nSo long shall S\xc4\x81gar\'s sons remain,  \n And, god-like, rank in heaven retain.  \n Gang\xc4\x81 thine eldest child shall be,  \n Called from thy name Bhagirathi." *\n\nAs a consequence of faith in this legend, one of the most frequented places of\npilgrimage in India is S\xc4\x81gar Island, the place where the river Ganges and\nocean meet.\n\nIn addition to the Ganges, there are many other rivers regarded as sacred by\nthe Hindus; the worship of these, and bathing in them, being productive of\nalmost as great blessings as are to be obtained from Gang\xc4\x81 herself. Some of\nthese are considered as males and some as females. The following is not a\ncomplete list, but it contains the names of the rivers most generally\nworshipped.\n\nMale rivers:--The Sona and the Brahmaputra.\n\nFemale rivers:--The God\xc4\x81var\xc4\xab, the K\xc4\x81veri, the Atrey\xc4\xab, the Karaloy\xc4\x81, the\nBahud\xc4\x81, the Gomati, the Sarayu, the Gandak\xc4\xab, the Varah\xc4\xab, the Charmanwat\xc4\xab, the\nShatadru, the Vip\xc4\x81sh\xc4\x81, the Goutam\xc4\xab, the Karman\xc4\x81sh\xc4\x81, the Air\xc4\x81vat\xc4\xab, the\nChandrabh\xc4\x81g\xc4\x81, the Vitast\xc4\x81, the Sindhu, the Krishn\xc4\x81, the Vetravat\xc4\xab, the\nBhairav\xc4\x81. \xe2\x80\xa0\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[461:*](hmvp45.htm#fr_426) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," i. 171.\n\n[461:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp45.htm#fr_427) S\xc4\x81gara\'s birth was supernatural. His father B\xc4\x81hu,\nKing of Ayodha, was expelled from his kingdom. The mother of S\xc4\x81gara p. 462\naccompanied her husband to the forest, but, owing to a poisonous drug having\nbeen given her by a rival wife, she could not bring forth her son, with whom\nshe had been pregnant for seven years. When her husband died, she wished to be\nburned with his body; but this was prevented by a sage named Aurva, who\nassured her that her son would yet be born, and grow up to be a mighty king.\nWhen he was born, Aurva gave him the name S\xc4\x81gara ( _sa_ , with, and _gara_ ,\npoison). Aurva himself was also born in an extraordinary manner. A king named\nKritavirya was very liberal to the Bhrigus, and through his liberality they\nbecame rich. His descendants being poor, they asked help of the Bhrigus. On\nthis being refused them, they made an onslaught on the Br\xc4\x81hmans of this\nfamily, slaying all they could find, even to children in the womb. One woman\nconcealed her unborn child in her thigh. The Kshattriyas, hearing of this,\ntried to slay him, but he issued from his mother\'s thigh with such lustre that\nhe blinded his persecutors. And because he was born from the thigh ( _uru_ )\nof his mother, he was called Aurva.\n\n[462:*](hmvp45.htm#fr_428) Griffiths\'s " R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," i. 174.\n\n[463:*](hmvp45.htm#fr_429) Griffiths\'s R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," i. 175.\n\n[463:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp45.htm#fr_430) Ibid., 177.\n\n[464:*](hmvp45.htm#fr_431) Griffiths\'s " R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," i. 177.\n\n[465:*](hmvp45.htm#fr_432) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," i. 183.\n\n[465:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp45.htm#fr_433) Ibid., 186.\n\n[466:*](hmvp45.htm#fr_434) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," i. 190.\n\n[466:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp45.htm#fr_435) Ibid.\n\n[467:*](hmvp45.htm#fr_436) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," i. 193.\n\n[467:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp45.htm#fr_437) Ibid., 196.\n\n[468:*](hmvp45.htm#fr_438) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," i. 197.\n\n[468:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp45.htm#fr_439) Ward, ii. 217.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX.
