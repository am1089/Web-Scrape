Indra: There is no such thing to-day, nor will it be so to-morrow. Who\nknows what strange thing [1](sbe3230.htm#an_1:170:1:1) this is? We must\nconsult the thought of another, for even what we once knew seems to vanish.\n\n2\\. Agastya: Why dost thou wish to kill us, O Indra? the Maruts are thy\nbrothers; fare kindly with them, and do not strike\n[1](sbe3230.htm#an_1:170:2:1) us in battle.\n\n3\\. The Maruts: O brother Agastya, why, being a friend, dost thou despise us?\nWe know quite well what thy mind was. Dost thou not wish to give to us?\n\n4\\. Agastya: Let them prepare the altar, let them light the fire in front!\nHere we two will spread [2](sbe3230.htm#an_1:170:4:2) for thee the sacrifice,\nto be seen [1](sbe3230.htm#an_1:170:4:1) by the immortal.\n\n5\\. Agastya: Thou rulest, O lord of treasures; thou, lord of friends, art the\nmost generous. Indra, speak again with the Maruts, and then consume our\nofferings at the right season.\n\np. 287\n\n##### NOTES.\n\nAlthough this hymn is not directly addressed to the Maruts, yet as it refers\nto the before-mentioned rivalry between the Maruts and Indra, and as the\nauthor is supposed to be the same, namely Agastya, I give its translation\nhere.\n\nNone of its verses occurs in SV., VS., TS., AV.\n\nThe Anukrama _n_ ika ascribes verses 1, 3, 4 to Indra, 2 and 5 to Agastya;\nLudwig assigns verses 1 and 3 to the Maruts, 2, 4, and 5 to Agastya; Grassmann\ngives verse 1 to Indra, 2 and 3 to the Maruts, and 4 and 5 to Agastya.\n\nThe hymn admits of several explanations. There was a sacrifice in which Indra\nand the Maruts were invoked together, and it is quite possible that our hymn\nmay owe its origin to this. But it is possible also that the sacrifice may be\nthe embodiment of the same ideas which were originally expressed in this and\nsimilar hymns, namely, that Indra, however powerful by himself; could not\ndispense with the assistance of the storm-gods. I prefer to take the latter\nview, but I do not consider the former so untenable as I did formerly. The\nidea that a great god like Indra did not like to be praised together with\nothers is an old idea, and we find traces of it in the hymns themselves, e. g.\nII, 33, 4. ma\xc2\xb4 du _h_ stuti, ma\xc2\xb4 sahuti.\n\nIt is quite possible, therefore, that our hymn contains the libretto of a\nlittle ceremonial drama in which different choruses of priests are introduced\nas preparing a sacrifice for the Maruts and for Indra, and as trying to\nappease the great Indra, who is supposed to feel slighted. Possibly Indra and\nthe Maruts too may have been actually represented by some actors, so that\nhere, as elsewhere, the first seeds of the drama would be found in sacrificial\nperformances.\n\nI propose, though this can only be hypothetical, to take the first verse as a\nvehement complaint of Indra, when asked to share the sacrifice with the\nMaruts. In the second\n\np. 288\n\nverse Agastya is introduced as trying to pacify Indra. The third verse is most\nlikely an appeal of the Maruts to remind Indra that the sacrifice was\noriginally intended for them. Verses 4 and 5 belong to Agastya, who, though\nfrightened into obedience to Indra, still implores him to make his peace with\nthe Maruts.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. In the first verse Indra expresses his surprise in disconnected\nsentences, saying that such a thing has never happened before. I do not take\nadbhuta (nie da gewesen) in the sense of future, because that is already\ncontained in _s_ vas. The second line expresses that Indra does not remember\nsuch a thing, and must ask some one else, whether he remembers anything like\nit. We ought to take abhisa _m_ _k_ are _n_ ya as one word, and probably in\nthe sense of to be approached or to be accepted. Abhisa _m_ _k_ arin, however,\nmeans also changeable.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Vadhi _h_ is the augmentless indicative, not subjunctive; see,\nhowever, Delbruck, Synt. Forsch. I, pp. 21, 115.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. _K_ etana refers to ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a as in VIII, 13, 8. It means that\nwhich attracts the attention of the gods (IV, 7, 2), and might be translated\nby beacon.\n\nNote 2. The dual tanavavahai is strange. It may refer, as Grassmann supposes,\nto Agastya and his wife, Lopamudra, but even that is very unusual. See\nOldenberg, K. Z. XXXIX, 62. Professor Oldenberg (K. Z. XXXIX, 60 seq.) takes\nthis and the next hymn as parts of the same \xc3\x82khyana hymn, and as intimately\nconnected with the Marutvatiya _S_ astra of the midday Savana, in the Soma\nsacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 171.
