Disputes between father and son, neglect of (prescribed) penances, abstraction of gifts (made to worthy persons), the wrath of anchorites,\n\n* 4. Sinful confusion of castes, the rules regarding their means of subsistence, and (in short) whatever\n\np. 215\n\nhas been omitted in the preceding (titles of law), are treated under the head\nof Miscellaneous.\n\n5. 5 The king shall be careful to protect all orders and the constituent elements of his state with the four means indicated by science.\n\n6. 6 When any caste should remain (behind the rest) or exceed the limits (assigned to it, the king), seeing that it has strayed from its path, shall bring it back to the path (of duty).\n\n7. 7 So also, when other wicked acts, opposed to the dictates of the sacred law, have been committed, the king, after having reflected (upon the matter) himself, shall inflict punishment on those who deserve it.\n\n8\\. What is opposed to revealed and traditional law, or injurious to living\nbeings, must not be practised by the king; and when it is practised (by\nothers), he must check it.\n\n* 9. When an act contrary to justice has been undertaken by a former king from folly, he must redress that iniquitous enactment in accordance with the principles of equity.\n\n* 10. 10 The weapons of soldiers, the tools of artizans, the ornaments of public women, the various musical or other instruments of professional (musicians, or other artists, &c.),\n\n* 11. And any implements by which artificers gain\n\np. 216\n\ntheir substance, must not be laid hold on by the king, even when he\nconfiscates the entire property (of a man or woman).\n\n12\\. It is not permitted to either advise or rebuke a king or Brahman, on\naccount of their dignity and sanctity, unless they should swerve from the path\n(of duty).\n\n13\\. That wicked man who does not act up to the laws proclaimed by the king,\nshall be fined and corporally punished, as offending against the king's\ncommandments.\n\n14. 14 If the king were remiss in dictating punishments to (members of) any caste, when they have left the path (of duty), the created beings of this world would perish.\n\n15\\. Brahmans would leave the sacerdotal caste, and Kshatriyas would forsake\nthe Kshatriya caste. The stronger would eat up the weaker, like fish on a\nspit.\n\n16. 16 The Vai _s_ yas would abandon their work, and the _S_ udras eclipse all (the rest), if the kings did not visit their subjects with punishment (when they have committed an offence).\n\n17\\. To show favour to the virtuous at all times and to oppress the wicked,\nthat is declared to be the duty of kings; gain (results to them) from the\noppression of their foes.\n\n18\\. As fire is not polluted even though it always burns the creatures of this\nworld, even so a king is not polluted by inflicting punishment on those who\ndeserve it.\n\n19. 19 Intelligence is the glory of rulers; it becomes\n\np. 217\n\nmanifest in their speeches; whatever sentence they may pass, whether unjust or\njust, settles the law between litigant parties.\n\n20\\. (Law) personified as a king, roams on earth visibly, with a thousand\neyes. Mortals cannot live at all if they transgress his commandments.\n\n21\\. Whatever a king does is right, that is a settled rule; because the\nprotection of the world is entrusted to him, and on account of his majesty and\nbenignity towards living creatures.\n\n22\\. As a husband though feeble must be constantly worshipped by his wives, in\nthe same way a ruler though worthless must be (constantly) worshipped by his\nsubjects.\n\n23\\. In order that mortals, fearing the orders issued by kings, might not\nswerve from the path of duty, therefore royal orders are declared to arise\nfrom lawsuits.\n\n24. 24 It is for the establishment of order that various laws ( _k_ aritra) have been proclaimed by kings. A royal order is declared to overrule such laws even.\n\n25\\. A ruler has purchased his subjects through (the practice of) austerities;\ntherefore the king is their lord. For that reason, his bidding must be obeyed;\ntheir livelihood even depends on the king.\n\n26. 26 Kings, endowed with immense power, appear (variously) in the five different forms of Agni, Indra, Soma, Yama, and the God of Riches.\n\np. 218\n\n27. 27 When a ruler is, either justly or without (sufficient) reason, ardent in wrath and burns (or torments) his subjects, he is called Agni (the god of fire).\n\n28. 28 When, relying on his regal power, the king attacks his foes, desirous of victory and upraising a weapon, he is termed Indra.\n\n29. 29 When, free from ardent wrath, he appears before his subjects with a cheerful countenance, he is denoted Soma (the Moon).\n\n30. 30 When the king having seated himself, full of majesty, on the throne of judgment, deals out punishment, equitable towards all creatures, he is called Vaivasvata (or Yama).\n\n31\\. When a ruler gladdens with gifts petitioners, persons commanding respect,\nwise men, servants and others, he is called the God of Riches.\n\n32\\. Therefore one must not treat him with contempt, and, particularly, not\nscold at him, and pay obedience to his bidding; to disobey him would bring on\n(instantaneous) death.\n\n33. 33 His duties are, the protection of his subjects, honouring the aged and wise, the trial of lawsuits, and to make (each caste) abide by the duties assigned to it.\n\n34. 34 Let a king be constantly intent on showing honour to the Brahmans. A field furnished with Brahmans is the root of the prosperity of the world.\n\n35. 35 A Brahman may command respect, and a\n\np. 219\n\ndistinguished seat at the king's court. The king shall show his face in the\nmorning before the Brahmans first of all, and shall salute them all.\n\n36. 36 When nine or seven persons (of different rank) meet, they shall first make room for the Brahman to pass by. (Further privileges assigned to the Brahman caste are) free access to the houses of other people, for the purpose of begging alms,\n\n37. 37 The right to collect fuel, flowers, water, and the like, without its being regarded as theft, and to converse with other men's wives, without being restrained (in such intercourse) by others,\n\n38. 38 And the right to cross rivers without paying any fare, and to be conveyed (to the other bank) before other people. When engaged in trading and using a ferry-boat, they shall have to pay no toll.\n\np. 220\n\n39. 39 A Brahman engaged in travelling, who is tired and has nothing to eat, commits no wrong by taking himself two canes of sugar or two esculent roots.\n\n40. 40 (No gift must be accepted) from one accused of a crime, an outcast, an enemy, an atheist, one in distress, without necessity, or after inflicting pain on the giver.\n\n41\\. (Gifts shall be accepted) from industrious people on account of their\nwealth, and from generous people because it is proper to accept gifts from\nsuch; to accept gifts from kings is laudable; (they may be accepted) from all\npeople excepting Brahmans.\n\n42\\. Between a Brahman and a king, who are both devoted to their duty, there\nis no difference of any sort, when they protect mankind (acting) in accordance\nwith the sacred law.\n\n43\\. If a ruler, though severe, is mindful of his duty, correct in his\nconduct, and (quick to) punish the wicked, in order to protect (the virtuous),\nhis wealth is declared to be pure.\n\n44. 44 When a man accepts a gift from a covetous king, who transgresses the precepts of the sacred books, he shall have to pass through the well-known twenty-one hells in succession.\n\n45. 45 As pure and impure waters become alike on their junction in the ocean, even so (all) property acquired by a king (becomes pure in his hands).\n\np. 221\n\n46\\. As gold, on being thrown into blazing fire, acquires purity, even so all\ngains become pure in the hands of kings.\n\n47\\. When any man gives any property of his to Brahmans, the king must give\nhis consent to it; this is an eternal law.\n\n48. 48 Both the other customary receipts of a king and what is called the sixth of the produce of the soil, form the royal revenue, the reward (of a king) for the protection of his subjects.\n\n49\\. Whatever has been bestowed on others than Brahmans may be resumed; but\nthat which has been given to Brahmans can never be taken back again.\n\n50. 50 To give, to read, and to sacrifice (on his own account) are the three duties of a Brahman. To sacrifice for others, to teach, and, thirdly, to collect alms are his (three) means of subsistence.\n\n51\\. Let a Brahman be devoted to his duty and take a livelihood from the king,\nand let him not accept gifts from persons of vile origin, if he is anxious to\nobserve the law.\n\n52\\. How should a king be inferior to a deity, as it is through his word that\nan offender may become innocent, and an innocent man an offender in due\ncourse?\n\n53\\. Those who being acquainted with the divine nature of a king, endowed with\nmajestic dignity as he is, accept gifts from him, do not in the least disgrace\nthemselves (by doing so).\n\n54\\. In this world, there are eight sacred objects:\n\np. 222\n\na Brahman, a cow, fire, gold, clarified butter, the sun, the waters, and a\nking as the eighth.\n\n55\\. These one must always look up to, worship and honour them personally, and\nturn the right side towards them, in order that one's existence may be\nprolonged.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[214:1](sbe3349.htm#fr_645) XVIII, 1-4. The meagre contents of this title of\nlaw can hardly he said to be in keeping with the somewhat pompous announcement\ncontained in paragraphs 1-4. On the whole, this title of Miscellanies, as\ndefined by Narada and B _ri_ haspati, may be described as treating of public\nlaw or the law of kings (ra _g_ adharma), private law being treated in the\nseventeen other titles of law.\n\n1\\. 'Obedience towards his injunctions,' thus according to the Mitakshara, p.\n351. The Viramitrodaya refers the term tatkarmakara _n_ am to those who, from\narrogance, do such acts as are permitted to a king only, such as e.g. placing\nthemselves on the king's throne.\n\n[214:2](sbe3349.htm#fr_646) 'Grants of towns,' i.e. to Brahmans and others.\nNarada seems to be referring to the so-called Agraharas. Regarding the seven\nconstituent parts of a state, see Manu VII, 157; IX, 294. Naigama has been\ntranslated 'followers of the Veda,' because it comes immediately after pasha\n_n_ _d_ i, 'heretics.' See, too, X, 1. It usually denotes citizens or traders.\n\n[215:5](sbe3349.htm#fr_647) 'The four means' of conciliation, division,\nbribery, and force. Manu VIII, 41.\n\n[215:6](sbe3349.htm#fr_648) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 360. The Nepalese MS. offers\na variation as regards the arrangement of paragraphs 6-11.\n\n[215:7](sbe3349.htm#fr_649) Manu VII, 16; VIII, 126; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I,\n367; Vasish _th_ a XIX, 8; Vish _n_ u III, 37.\n\n[215:10](sbe3349.htm#fr_650) For 'the tools of artizans' the Nepalese MS., in\ncommon with the Mitakshara, has 'the beasts of burden and the like of carriers\nof goods.'\n\n[216:14](sbe3349.htm#fr_651) 14, 15. Manu VII, 20.\n\n[216:16](sbe3349.htm#fr_652) Manu VII, 21, 24.\n\n[216:19](sbe3349.htm#fr_653) For 'intelligence' the Nepalese MS. has 'a royal\nedict.'\n\n[217:24](sbe3349.htm#fr_654) _K_ aritra seems to mean 'law' or 'custom' in\nthis place. Regarding the comparative authority of _k_ aritra and ra _g_ a _s_\nasana, 'a royal order,' see [p. 7](sbe3305.htm#page_7), note\n[11](sbe3305.htm#fn_30). The Nepalese MS. omits 23, 24.\n\n[217:26](sbe3349.htm#fr_655) Read rupa _n_ i in the text.\n\n[218:27](sbe3349.htm#fr_656) Manu IX, 310.\n\n[218:28](sbe3349.htm#fr_657) Manu IX, 304.\n\n[218:29](sbe3349.htm#fr_658) Manu IX, 309.\n\n[218:30](sbe3349.htm#fr_659) Manu IX, 307.\n\n[218:33](sbe3349.htm#fr_660) Manu VII, 35, 38; VIII, 3, &c.\n\n[218:34](sbe3349.htm#fr_661) Manu VII, 82, 83; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 314.\n\n[218:35](sbe3349.htm#fr_662) Manu VII, 37.\n\n[219:36](sbe3349.htm#fr_663) That privilege of the Brahman caste, which is\nreferred to in the first part of this paragraph, finds its explanation in a\nwell-known rule of the Dharma _s_ astra regarding persons for whom way must be\nmade, on meeting them in a road. Thus it is ruled by Gautama (VI, 24) that way\nmust be made for a man seated in a carriage, for one who is in his tenth\n(decade), for one requiring consideration, for a woman, for a Snataka, and for\na king; but that a king himself must make way for a _S_ rotriya (learned\nBrahman). This makes in all seven persons for whom way should be made. Manu\n(II, 138), Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya (I, 117), Baudhayana (II, 6, 30), and Vish _n_ u\n(LXIII. 51) agree in enumerating eight persons of this sort. Vasish _th_ a\n(XIV, 57-60) mentions nine. See, too, \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 11, 5-7.\n\n[219:37](sbe3349.htm#fr_664) Manu VIII, 339; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 10, 28, 3; Gautama\nXII, 28; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 166.\n\n[219:38](sbe3349.htm#fr_665) Manu VIII, 407; Vish _n_ u V, 132. The last\nclause is thus given in the Nepalese MS.: 'They shall have to pay no toll on\nbeing carried across a river in a ferry, unless (they should cross it) for\ntrading purposes.'\n\n[220:39](sbe3349.htm#fr_666) Gautama XII, 49, 50; Manu VIII, 341. Or 'five\nesculent roots,' according to the Nepalese MS.\n\n[220:40](sbe3349.htm#fr_667) Manu II, 185.\n\n[220:44](sbe3349.htm#fr_668) For a list of the twenty-one hells, see Manu IV,\n88-90; Vish _n_ u XLIII, 1-22. The Nepalese MS. omits this paragraph.\n\n[220:45](sbe3349.htm#fr_669) A different opinion has been enounced above, XV,\n14.\n\n[221:48](sbe3349.htm#fr_670) Manu VII, 130-132; Gautama X, 24-27; Vasish _th_\na XIX, 26, 27; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 26, 9; Vish _n_ u III, 22-25; Baudhayana I,\n10, 18, 1.\n\n[221:50](sbe3349.htm#fr_671) Manu I, 88, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Appendix: Theft](sbe3350.htm)\n\n"
