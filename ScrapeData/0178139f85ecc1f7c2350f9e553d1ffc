Vyasa said :-- Hearing the Devi\xc2\x92s words, the king Subahu began to say with\ngreat devotion thus :--\n\n\n\n2-3. O Devi! If there be made a comparison between the kingdom of the Devas\nand the world on the one hand and the vision of Thine on the other hand, then\nit must be acknowledged that the kingdom of the Devas and the earth cannot\nstand in comparison before Thee. O Devi! There cannot be anything, in this\nTriloki, that is more exalted than Thy vision; therefore, O Mother! What other\nboon may I ask from Thee. I am very thankful and blessed; all my desires are\nfulfilled, when I have seen Thee.\n\n\n\np. 218\n\n\n\n4-5. O Auspicious Mother! I ask from You this boon, my desire that my devotion\nmay remain constant, fixed, and unflinching towards You. O Mother! You would\nremain always in this city of mine being celebrated under the name of S\xc2\x92ri\nDurga Devi, Your S\xc2\x92akti. This is my desire.\n\n\n\n6-9. O Devi! As you have cleared off all the obstacles of Sudars\xc2\x92ana and saved\nhim from this danger, so remain here in this city of Benares and protect it,\nso long as this city stands on the face of the earth and make it firm and well\nestablished and renowned. O Durga, I pray that you may grant me these boons. O\nDevi! Grant me also various other desires of mine and destroy my enemies and\nextirpate all the irreligious and wicked people in this city. O Goddess of\nmercy! What more can I ask from you?\n\n\n\n10-11. Vyasa said :-- Thus praising and praying, the king Subahu stood, with\nfolded hands, before the Devi Durga, the remover of all calamities, when She\naddressed thus :-- O king! I will remain no doubt, in this city of Benares,\nthe place of salvation, as long as it stands on the face of the earth and\nprotect all the people here.\n\n\n\n12\\. Then came there Sudars\xc2\x92ana, heartily gladdened; and he bowed to Her and\nbegan to praise Her with intense joy and devotion.\n\n\n\n13\\. O Mother of this Universe! Everyone in this world shows mercy to those\nthat are devoted to him; but, O Mother! I see, in Your case, You take it as if\nYour bounden duty, to save those, that are void of any devotion towards You;\nfor You have saved my life, though I am devoid of any devotion towards you.\nTherefore how can I describe the boundless ocean of mercy that reigns in You!\n\n\n\n14\\. O Goddess! I have heard that You have created all this Universe, with its\nelements, and You are preserving this Your own creations and again You will\ndestroy it in due time. Therefore O Mother! What wonder is there that you have\nsaved me!\n\n\n\n15\\. O Goddess! Now order me early what work of Yours shall I do now? Where\nshall I go? O Mother! Now I am unable to make out my duty; therefore kindly\norder me whether I will remain here or go anywhere else or remain anywhere, I\nlike, at my leisure?\n\n\n\n16\\. Vyasa said :-- On Sudars\xc2\x92ana thus petitioning before the Devi, She said\nwith much kindness :-- \xc2\x93O good soul! Go to Ayodhya and govern the country\nbefitting your family.\n\n\n\n17\\. O king! Constantly remember Me and worship Me with great care. I will\nalways look after the welfare of your kingdom.\n\n\n\np. 219\n\n\n\n18\\. Especially in the eighth, fourteenth, and in the ninth day of the lunar\nhalf month, worship Me according to the prescribed rites and rules and offer\nme victims (sacrifices).\n\n\n\n19\\. O sinless one! Establish my image in this city and worship it three\ntimes, morning, mid-day and evening carefully and with devotion.\n\n\n\n20\\. It is noteworthy that My Great Puja in autumn for the nine nights\n(Navaratra) ought to be done with the greatest devotion.\n\n\n\n21-22. O king! In the month of Chaitra, Magh, \xc3\x82s'vin, and \xc3\x82 _s_ a _d_ ha, My\ngrand festival should be done on the four Navaratris respectively; and\nespecially on the fourteenth and on the eighth day of the black half, all\npersons ought to worship Me with their minds full of devotion towards Me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n23\\. Vyasa said :-- After the Devi, the Goddess Durga, the Destroyer of all\ndangers, had finished Her sayings, Sudars\xc2\x92ana bowed down to Her and praised\nHer much. The Devi, giving him the above mentioned advices, disappeared.\n\n\n\n24\\. Seeing Her disappear, all the kings went to Sudars\xc2\x92ana and bowed to him,\nas the Devas go to their lord, the Indra.\n\n\n\n25\\. The king of Benares, Subahu, too, gladly bowed down and stood before him.\nThen all the kings began to address Sudars\xc2\x92an, the king of Ayodhya.\n\n\n\n26\\. \xc2\x93O king! You are our lord and governor; we are always your servants;\nprotect us as the king of Ayodhya.\n\n\n\n27\\. O king! It is through your grace only that we have seen the Supreme\nForce, the Goddess of this Universe, the most Auspicious, the Eternal Bhavani,\nthe Giver of the fourfold desires.\n\n\n\n28\\. O king! It is for your sake that the Eternal, Highest Prakriti Devi\nappeared; therefore you are very fortunate, auspicious, and most blessed in\nthis world. Your have finished, as it were, all that you had to do.\n\n\n\n29\\. O king! We all are deluded by the Maya of that Mahamaya Chandika Devi;\ntherefore none of us is able to know Her prowess.\n\n\n\n30\\. We are always engaged in thinking of wealth, sons and wives; there we are\nmerged in this awful ocean of delusion, infested with crocodiles, etc., in the\nshape of lust, anger, greed, etc.\n\n\n\n31\\. O Blessed one! You are highly enlightened and you know everything; hence\nwe ask you What is this Force; whence has She sprung? How is Her prowess?\nKindly describe all these to us.\n\n\n\np. 220\n\n\n\n32\\. O Descendant of Kakud! The saints are always merciful; kindly therefore\nrelate to us the glory of the Excellent Goddess, that serves the purpose of a\nboat in crossing this ocean of world (transmigration).\n\n\n\n33\\. O king! I am intensely desirous to hear the prowess and nature of the\nDevi.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nNote :-- Kakud is an epithet of Puranjaya, son of S'asada, a king of the solar\ndynasty, and a descendant of Ikshvaku. The Mythology relates that when in\ntheir war with the demons, the gods were often worsted; they, headed by Indra\nwent to the powerful king Puranjaya and requested him to be their friend in\nbattle. The latter consented to do so, provided Indra carried him on his\nshoulders. Indra accordingly assumed the form of a bull and Puranjaya seated\non its hump, completely vanquished the demons. Puranjaya is therefore\nKakutstha \xc2\x91standing on a hump.\xc2\x92\n\n\n\n34\\. Vyasa said :-- When the kings had thus asked, the son of Dhruvasandhi,\nthe king Sudaras'ana became very glad and, meditating on the Goddess, began to\nsay thus :--\n\n\n\n35\\. \xc2\x93O kings! Indra and the other Devas, even Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahes\xc2\x92a\nare unable to fathom the most exalted deeds of that Goddess; how, then, can I\ndescribe to you the great glory of the Mahamaya.\n\n\n\n36-38. O kings! The Bhagavati Bhavani is present, as it were, being divided\ninto four parts. She who is the first and foremost, the excellent Sattvic\nEnergy, worshipped by all, is always engaged in the preservation of this\nworld. That part which is engaged in creating this world, is called the\nRajasik Energy; and that part which is engaged in destroying the world is\ncalled the Tamasik Energy, and that part which is the cause of all, Brahma,\netc., that Highest S\xc2\x92akti, the Bestower of all desires, is called the fourth\nS\xc2\x92akti, the Nirgu _n_ a S\xc2\x92akti.\n\n\n\n39\\. O kings! Those who are not Yogis, will never be able to grasp the Nirgu\n_n_ a S\xc2\x92akti. The Saguna Force can be easily served. All those middle\nAdhikaris (fit persons) and learned men always meditate and worship the Saguna\nAspect of Her.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n40-41. The kings said :-- \xc2\x93O king! You got afraid and went in your very early\nage to the forest; how is it, then, that you have been able to know the\nexcellent Goddess Mahamaya. How did you worship and pray to Her? That She,\nbecoming so glad, has favoured you and so helped you?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 221\n\n\n\n42-43. Sudars\xc2\x92an said :-- \xc2\x93O kings! Early in my childhood, I got the excellent\nroot-mantra of desires, Kamavija; daily I meditated and silently uttered that\nmantram. After that I came to realise through the Ri _s_ is That Eternal\nAuspicious Mother; and since that time, day and night, I always used to\nremember that Highest Deity; with the greatest devotion.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n44\\. Vyasa said :-- Hearing the words of Sudars\xc2\x92ana, the kings came to know\nthat the Goddess which they saw was the Highest Force and filled with the\ngreatest devotion towards Her, returned to their own homes.\n\n\n\n45\\. The king of Benares, Subahu, returned to his own city after bidding good-\nbye to Sudars\xc2\x92ana. The virtuous Sudars\xc2\x92ana, too, went towards his Kosala\nkingdom.\n\n\n\n46\\. The ministers were very glad to hear the death of S\xc2\x92atrujit and to see\nthe victory of Sudars\xc2\x92ana.\n\n\n\n47-48. The inhabitants and armies of Sakata (Ayodhya) hearing that Sudars\xc2\x92ana\nis coming and knowing him to be the son of the king Dhruvasandhi, became\nhighly delighted and approached to him with various offerings.\n\n\n\n49-50. Sudars\xc2\x92ana, with his new consort, arrived at Ayodhya with his heart\nhighly gladdened, and shewed his due regard and respect towards all his\nsubjects. Then the ministers came and sainted him; the women threw at him\nofferings of Laja (fried rice) and flowers; the bards began to praise loudly.\nThus, honoured by various auspicious ceremonies, the king entered into his\npalace.\n\n\n\nHere ends the 24th chapter on the installation of Durga Devi in the city of\nBenares and the return to Ayodhya of Sudars\xc2\x92ana in the Maha Pura _n_ am\nS\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 25](bk03ch25.htm)\n\n"
