The King spoke :-- O Grandfather! How did Vi _sn_ u, the Powerful, the\nCause of the world, perform the Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a? Whose help did he receive and what\npriests with their knowledge of the Vedas did he engage, kindly tell all these\nto me in special details. I will very attentively hear first this Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a,\nperformed by Vi _sn_ u; and then I will make arrangements to do that myself\naccordingly.\n\n\n\n4\\. Vyasa said :-- O noble one! Hear in detail that very wonderful thing, how\nVi _sn_ u celebrated the Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a comformably to the rules laid down in the\nS\xc2\x92astras.\n\n\n\n5\\. When Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahes\xc2\x92a were each given powers by the Devi,\nthe Goddess of the Universe, and when they parted, these three Devas became\nfree from their womanhood, while they were coming back in their aerial cars\nand turned out men, as they were before.\n\n\n\n6\\. These three Devas, found the great ocean before them. They brought out\nworld from it; and built, in that world, dwelling abodes; and they themselves\nbegan to live in some of them.\n\n\n\np. 171\n\n\n\n7\\. That world became fixed, steady and the supporter of all beings when the\nGoddess imparted the power of fixture, steadiness, and the power of supporting\nto the world. The earth, filled with marrow, then, became fixed and the great\nsupporter by Her power.\n\n\n\n8-10. O King! The name of this earth is Medini, since it was made out of the\nmarrow of the two Asuras Madhu and Kai _t_ abha. This earth is termed Dhara\nbecause it supports all; is termed Prithvi because it is very capacious; and\nit is called Mahi because it is great, since it supports so many beings. O\nKing! the Ananta serpent is holding it on her thousand-hoods. To make the\nearth remain solid and compact, Brahma built at places mountains. As iron\nnails in a log of wood, so these hills and mountains within this earth made it\nfixed. Therefore the Pundits call these mountains \xc2\x93Mahidhara,\xc2\x94 holder of the\nearth.\n\n\n\n11\\. O King! Thus the golden Meru, the great mountain, many Yojanas wide,\nadorned with many golden mountain peaks was created.\n\n\n\n12\\. Next Marichi, Narada, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Dak _s_ a, and Vas\xc2\x92i\n_st_ ha were created by Brahma; these are the Brahma\xc2\x92s mental sons (sons\ncreated by the sheer power of mind).\n\n\n\n13\\. The son Kas\xc2\x92yapa was born to Marichi and thirteen daughters were born of\nDak _s_ a. From these daughters and out of the seed of Kas\xc2\x92yapa, various Devas\nand Daityas were born.\n\n\n\n14\\. Then human beings, animals, serpents and many other classes were created.\nThis is called the Kasyapi S\xc2\x92ri _st_ i or the Kas\xc2\x92yapa\xc2\x92s creation.\n\n\n\n15\\. Next Svayambhava Manu sprang from the lower half of Brahma; and the\ndaughter named S'atarupa came out of the left hand side of the Brahma\xc2\x92s body.\n\n\n\n16\\. The two sons Priyavrata and Uttanapada were born of Manu in the womb of\nS\xc2\x92atarupa and the three daughters, very beautiful and fair complexioned, were\nalso born of him.\n\n\n\n17\\. Creating then, the Bhagavan, the lotus born Brahma built the beautiful\nBrahma-loka, on the top of the Meru mountain.\n\n\n\n18\\. Then the Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u built the Vaiku _nt_ ha city on the top of\nall the lokas or worlds to dwell with his consort Lak _s_ mi.\n\n\n\n19\\. Mahadeva, too, built the exceedingly beautiful Kailas\xc2\x92a and stayed there\nwith his Bhutas and played with them at his will.\n\n\n\n20\\. The third Loka termed Heaven was built on the top of Meru, decorated with\nvarious precious gems and jewels and stones. It was fixed as the abode of\nIndra.\n\n\n\np. 172\n\n\n\n21-22. When the great ocean was churned, Parijata, the best of all the trees,\nthe elephant Airavata with four tusks, the Heavenly cow yielding the milk of\nall desires, the Uchchais\xc2\x92rava horse and Apsaras, Rambha and others, arose and\nwere taken by Indra. These became the ornaments of Heaven.\n\n\n\n23\\. The Moon and Dhanvantari, the great phyisician also came out of the\nchurning of the ocean. These surrounded with many other members began to\nshine, being situated above the Heavens.\n\n\n\n24\\. O King! Thus the three varieties, human beings, Devas, and Tiryakas\n(birds, etc.) and their great subvarieties sprang up.\n\n\n\n25\\. The four classes of Jivas, A _nd_ aja (born from the eggs), Svedaja (born\nout of sweats), Udbhija (plants, etc.) and Jarayuja (men, etc.) were created,\nbeing endowed with the fruits of their past auspicious or inauspicious Karmas,\nas the case may be.\n\n\n\n26\\. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahes\xc2\x92a began to play and walk about at their\nleisures in their respective spheres, after they finished all their creations.\n\n\n\n27\\. Thus the wheel of creation being started, the Great God Bhagavan Vi _sn_\nu Achyuta remained in sport with Maha Lak _s_ mi in His own sphere Vaiku _nt_\nha.\n\n\n\n28\\. Then Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, while sitting one day in Vaiku _nt_ ha, got in\nhis mind the memory of that beautiful island, called Ma _n_ i Dvipa, adorned\nwith precious stones, gems and jewels.\n\n\n\n29-33. O King! In this Ma _n_ i Dvipa, the Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u got the vision\nof the Maha Maya and the auspicious mantra. He now thought to celebrate a\nYaj\xc3\xb1a in honour of the Devi, when he recollected the highest Energy, the Great\nGoddess. He then went out of his abode and invited Brahma, Mahes\xc2\x92vara, Kuvera,\nIndra, Varu _n_ a, Fire, Yama, Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, Kas\xc2\x92yapa, Dak _s_ a, Vamadeva,\nBrihaspati and others and began to collect lots of materials necessary for the\nDevi sacrifice. Selecting a site Sattvik, beautiful, and possessing great\nspiritual powers, Vi _sn_ u erected, with the help of the great artists and\nengineers, a wide capacious sacrificial hall, and for the due celebration and\nfulfilment of it, appointed twenty seven priests; who pledged a solemn vow to\ncomplete it duly.\n\n\n\n34\\. When the big altar and chiti (pile of wood for burning, stack of\nsacrificial bricks) were finished, the Brahma _n_ as began to recite slowly\nthe Devi mantrams with their root mantrams.\n\n\n\nNote :-- Chiti, lit pile of wood for burning, is perhaps the Muladhara, the\nsacral plexus, where the fire called Kundalini is first kindled by processes\nof Yoga.\n\n\n\np. 173\n\n\n\n35-37. Then the profuse quantities of ghee were offered as oblations to to the\nSacred Fire. Thus when the Homa, (offering oblations of ghee to the fire)\nceremony was finished elaborately and conforming to the rules of the S\xc2\x92astras,\nthe sweet and melodious Heavenly voice was heard in the air, addressing Vi\n_sn_ u Bhagavan, thus :-- O Vi _sn_ u! Let You be the supreme amongst the\ngods; honour and worship shall be Thine first; and you would be the most\npowerful of the Devas. Indra together with Brahma, and the other Devas, all\nwill worship You.\n\n\n\n38-39. O Achyuta! (O Infallible One!) Those men on the earth that will be\ndevoted to you, will certainly be endowed with power and you shall be the\nbestower of boons and all their desires. O Vi _sn_ u! you will be the Supreme\nof the Devas and you will be the God of the gods; you will be the first and\nforemost in all the sacrifices and you will be worshipped by the sacrificers.\n\n\n\n40-41. People will worship you; and you will favour them with the boons. O\nbest of the Puru _s_ as! When the Devas will be troubled by the Asuras, they\nwill come and take refuge in Thee. You will be the Protector of all, there is\nno doubt in this. In all the Pura _n_ as and all this vast Vedas, You will be\nfirst worshipped.\n\n\n\n42\\. O Kes\xc2\x92ava! Wherever there will be decay and decline in religion, You will\nincarnate in your parts and preserve the religion.\n\n\n\n43-44. O Madhava! Avataras, renowned in all the worlds, will come down on\nearth as Your part incarnations in all sorts of wombs, in due order, and will\nbe respected by all the high souled personages. O Madhusudana! Those Avataras\nwill be the best of all the Avataras and will be famous all the Lokas, the\nworlds.\n\n\n\n45\\. In all your Avataras, you will get your attendants, the S\xc2\x92aktis (females)\ndrawing their energies from My parts; and they will serve your purposes.\n\n\n\n46-47. Varahi, Narasimhi, etc., and various other S\xc2\x92aktis of auspicious\nappearances, endowed with various weapons and decked with all the ornaments\nwill serve as your attendants; no doubt in this. O Vi _sn_ u! Always with\ntheir help and under the influence of My favour, you will no doubt be quite\ncompetent to serve the purposes of the Devas.\n\n\n\n48\\. You should respect and worship all those powers by all means and with\nvery great attention; never shew the slightest trace of pride to them; never\ndo you thus insult them.\n\n\n\n49\\. These S\xc2\x92aktis, capable of bestowing all the desires, will be worshipped\nin Pratimas (images of clay, etc.) in the whole of India.\n\n\n\np. 174\n\n\n\n50\\. O Deva of the Devas! The fame of all these S\xc2\x92aktis, as well as of You\nwill be spread in the seven worlds and in the whole Universe.\n\n\n\n51\\. O Hari! The human beings on this earth will constantly worship with\nselfish ends these powers and you, for the fructification of their desires.\n\n\n\n52\\. Having various desires, men will, in your worship, present various\nofferings, recite the Veda mantrams, and repeat the names of you and the\npowers.\n\n\n\n53\\. O Vi _sn_ u! You will be the God of the Immortals and your glory will be\nenhanced by the worship offered by the human beings in the world as well as in\nthe heavens.\n\n\n\n54\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! The heavenly voice, thus, bestowing boons on Vi\n_sn_ u, ceased. Vi _sn_ u Bhagavan became very glad to hear this.\n\n\n\n55-58. Then Hari, the God of Gods, completed duly the sacrifice and dismissed\nthe Devas and the Munis, the sons of Brahma. Then ascending on Garu _d_ a,\n(His Vahana), He went up to Vaiku _nt_ ha with his followers. The Devas also\nwent to their own respective places. The Munis also retired gladly to their\nown hermitages, all thunderstruck to see these things, conversing with each\nother about this sacrifice.\n\n\n\n59\\. O king! All were filled with best devotion towards the Supreme Force, on\nhearing this clear beautiful, sonorous heavenly voice; then the Dvijas, the\nMunis, and Munindras began to worship with devotion, according to the Vedas,\nthat Highest Force, the Supreme Goddess, giving all desired objects profusely\nin all the details.\n\n\n\nHere ends the thirteenth chapter on the Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a by S\xc2\x92ri Vi _sn_ u in the\nthird Adhyaya in S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam; the Maha Pura _n_ am by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 14](bk03ch14.htm)\n\n"
