And because it is directly stated in Scripture.\n\nThe text of the same Upanishad directly declares that the being denoted by the\nword 'Sat' evolves, as the universal Self, names and forms; is all-knowing,\nall-powerful, all-embracing; is free from all evil, &c.; realises all its\nwishes and purposes. 'Let me, entering those beings with this living; Self,\nevolve names and forms' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2); 'All these creatures have their\nroot in the Sat, they dwell in the Sat, they rest in the Sat' (VI, 8, 4); 'All\nthis has that for its Self; it is the True, it is the Self (VI, 8, 7);\n\np. 207\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Whatever there is of him here in the world, and\nwhatever is not, all that is contained within it' (VIII, 1, 3); 'In it all\ndesires are contained. It is the Self free from sin, free from old age, from\ndeath and grief, from hunger and thirst, whose wishes come true, whose\npurposes come true' (VIII, 1, 5).--And analogously other scriptural texts, 'Of\nhim there is no master in the world, no ruler; not even a sign of him. He is\nthe cause, the lord of the lords of the organs, and there is of him neither\nparent nor lord' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 9). 'The wise one who, having created all\nforms and having given them names, is calling them by those names' (Taitt. Ar.\nIII, 12, 7); 'He who entered within is the ruler of all beings, the Self of\nall' (Taitt. Ar. III, 24); 'The Self of all, the refuge, the ruler of all, the\nLord of the souls' (Mahanar. Up. XI); 'Whatsoever is seen or heard in this\nworld, inside or outside, pervading that all Naraya _n_ a abides' (Mahanar.\nUp. XI); 'He is the inner Self of all beings, free from all evil, the divine,\nthe only god Naraya _n_ a.'--These and other texts which declare the world to\nhave sprung from the highest Lord, can in no way be taken as establishing the\nPradhana. Hence it remains a settled conclusion that the highest Person,\nNaraya _n_ a, free from all shadow of imperfection, &c., is the single cause\nof the whole Universe, and is that Brahman which these Sutras point out as the\nobject of enquiry.\n\nFor the same reasons the theory of a Brahman, which is nothing but non-\ndifferenced intelligence, must also be considered as refuted by the Sutrakara,\nwith the help of the scriptural texts quoted; for those texts prove that the\nBrahman, which forms the object of enquiry, possesses attributes such as\nthinking, and so on, in their real literal sense. On the theory, on the other\nhand, of a Brahman that is nothing but distinctionless intelligence even the\nwitnessing function of consciousness would be unreal. The Sutras propose as\nthe object of enquiry Brahman as known from the Vedanta-texts, and thereupon\nteach that Brahman is intelligent (Su. I, 1, 5 ff.) To be intelligent means to\npossess the quality of intelligence: a being devoid of the quality of thought\nwould not differ in nature from the\n\np. 208\n\n[paragraph continues] Pradhana. Further, on the theory of Brahman being mere\nnon-differenced light it would be difficult to prove that Brahman is self-\nluminous. For by light we understand that particular thing which renders\nitself, as well as other things, capable of becoming the object of ordinary\nthought and speech; but as a thing devoid of all difference does not, of\ncourse, possess these two characteristics it follows that it is as devoid of\nintelligence as a pot may be.--Let it then be assumed that although a thing\ndevoid of all distinction does not actually possess these characteristics, yet\nit has the potentiality of possessing them!--But if it possesses the attribute\nof potentiality, it is clear that you abandon your entire theory of a\nsubstance devoid of all distinction!--Let us then admit, on the authority of\nScripture, that the universal substance possesses this one distinguishing\nattribute of self-luminousness.--Well, in that case you must of course admit,\non the same authority, all those other qualities also which Scripture vouches\nfor, such as all-knowingness, the possession of all powers, and so on.--\nMoreover, potentiality means capability to produce certain special effects,\nand hence can be determined on the ground of those special effects only. But\nif there are no means of knowing these particular effects, there are also no\nmeans of cognising potentiality.--And those who hold the theory of a substance\ndevoid of all difference, have not even means of proof for their substance;\nfor as we have shown before, Perception, Inference, Scripture, and one's own\nconsciousness, are all alike in so far as having for their objects things\nmarked by difference.--It therefore remains a settled conclusion that the\nBrahman to be known is nothing else but the highest Person capable of the\nthought 'of becoming many' by manifesting himself in a world comprising\nmanifold sentient and non-sentient creatures.--Here terminates the adhikara\n_n_ a of 'seeing'.\n\nSo far the Sutras have declared that the Brahman which forms the object of\nenquiry is different from the non-intelligent Pradhana, which is merely an\nobject of fruition for intelligent beings. They now proceed to show that\nBrahman--which is antagonistic to all evil and constituted\n\np. 209\n\nby supreme bliss--is different from the individual soul, which is subject to\nkarman, whether that soul be in its purified state or in the impure state that\nis due to its immersion in the ocean of manifold and endless sufferings,\nspringing from the soul's contact with Prak _ri_ ti (Pradhana).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13.
