Priyamvada, dear Shakuntala has been properly married by the\nvoluntary ceremony and she has a husband worthy of her. And yet I am not quite\nsatisfied.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Why not?\n\n_Anusuya_. The sacrifice is over and the good king was dismissed to-day by the\nhermits. He has gone back to the city and there he is surrounded by hundreds\nof court ladies. I wonder whether he will remember poor Shakuntala or not.\n\n_Priyamvada_. You need not be anxious about that. Such handsome men are sure\nto be good. But there is something else to think about. I don\'t know what\nFather will have to say when he comes back from his pilgrimage and hears about\nit.\n\n_Anusuya_. I believe that he will be pleased.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Why?\n\n_Anusuya_. Why not? You know he wanted to give his daughter to a lover worthy\nof her. If fate brings this about of itself, why shouldn\'t Father be happy?\n\n_Priyamvada_. I suppose you are right. ( _She looks at her flower-basket_.) My\ndear, we have gathered flowers enough for the sacrifice.\n\n_Anusuya_. But we must make an offering to the gods that watch over\nShakuntala\'s marriage. We had better gather more.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Very well. ( _They do so_.)\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. Who will bid me welcome?\n\n_Anusuya_ ( _listening_ ). My dear, it sounds like a guest announcing himself.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Well, Shakuntala is near the cottage.\n\n( _Reflecting_.) Ah, but to-day her heart is far away. Come,\n\np. 40\n\nwe must do with the flowers we have. ( _They start to walk away_.)\n\n_The voice_. Do you dare despise a guest like me?\n\nBecause your heart, by loving fancies blinded,  \n  Has scorned a guest in pious life grown old,  \nYour lover shall forget you though reminded,  \n  Or think of you as of a story told.\n\n( _The two girls listen and show dejection_.)\n\n_Priyamvada_. Oh, dear! The very thing has happened. The dear, absent-minded\ngirl has offended some worthy man.\n\n_Anusuya_ ( _looking ahead_ ). My dear, this is no ordinary somebody. It is\nthe great sage Durvasas, the irascible. See how he strides away!\n\n_Priyamvada_. Nothing burns like fire. Run, fall at his feet, bring him back,\nwhile I am getting water to wash his feet.\n\n_Anusuya_. I will. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _stumbling_ ). There! I stumbled in my excitement, and the\nflower-basket fell out of my hand. ( _She collects the scattered flowers_.\nANUSUYA _returns_.)\n\n_Anusuya_. My dear, he is anger incarnate. Who could appease him? But I\nsoftened him a little.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Even that is a good deal for him. Tell me about it.\n\n_Anusuya_. When he would not turn back, I fell at his feet and prayed to him.\n"Holy sir," I said, "remember her former devotion and pardon this offence.\nYour daughter did not recognise your great and holy power to-day."\n\n_Priyamvada_. And then------\n\n_Anusuya_. Then he said: "My words must be fulfilled. But the curse shall be\nlifted when her lover sees a gem which he has given her for a token." And so\nhe vanished.\n\n_Priyamvada_. We can breathe again. When the good king went away, he put a\nring, engraved with his own name, on Shakuntala\'s finger to remember him by.\nThat will save her.\n\n_Anusuya_. Come, we must finish the sacrifice for her. ( _They walk about_.)\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _gazing_ ). Just look, Anusuya! There is the dear girl, with\nher cheek resting on her left hand. She looks\n\np. 41\n\nlike a painted picture. She is thinking about him. How could she notice a\nguest when she has forgotten herself?\n\n_Anusuya_. Priyamvada, we two must keep this thing to ourselves. We must be\ncareful of the dear girl. You know how delicate she is.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Would any one sprinkle a jasmine-vine with scalding water? (\n_Exeunt ambo_.)\n\n#### SCENE II.-- _Early Morning_.\n\n( _Enter a pupil of_ KANVA, _just risen from sleep_.)\n\n_Pupil_. Father Kanva has returned from his pilgrimage, and has bidden me find\nout what time it is. I will go into the open air and see how much of the night\nremains. ( _He walks and looks about_.) See! The dawn is breaking. For already\n\nThe moon behind the western mount is sinking;  \n  The eastern sun is heralded by dawn;  \nFrom heaven\'s twin lights, their fall and glory linking,  \n  Brave lessons of submission may be drawn.\n\n[paragraph continues] And again:\n\nNight-blooming lilies, when the moon is hidden,  \n  Have naught but memories of beauty left.  \nHard, hard to bear! Her lot whom heaven has bidden  \n  To live alone, of love and lover reft.\n\n[paragraph continues] And again:\n\nOn jujube-trees the blushing dewdrops falter;  \n  The peacock wakes and leaves the cottage thatch;  \nA deer is rising near the hoof-marked altar,  \n  And stretching, stands, the day\'s new life to catch.\n\n[paragraph continues] And yet again:\n\nThe moon that topped the loftiest mountain ranges,  \n  That slew the darkness in the midmost sky,  \nIs fallen from heaven, and all her glory changes:  \n  So high to rise, so low at last to lie!\n\n_Anusuya_ ( _entering hurriedly. To herself_ ). That is just what happens to\nthe innocent. Shakuntala has been treated shamefully by the king.\n\np. 42\n\n_Pupil_. I will tell Father Kanva that the hour of morning sacrifice is come.\n( _Exit_.)\n\n_Anusuya_. The dawn is breaking. I am awake bright and early. But what shall I\ndo now that I am awake? My hands refuse to attend to the ordinary morning\ntasks. Well, let love take its course. For the dear, pure-minded girl trusted\nhim--the traitor! Perhaps it is not the good king\'s fault. It must be the\ncurse of Durvasas. Otherwise, how could the good king say such beautiful\nthings, and then let all this time pass without even sending a message? ( _She\nreflects_.) Yes, we must send him the ring he left as a token. But whom shall\nwe ask to take it? The hermits are unsympathetic because they have never\nsuffered. It seemed as if her friends were to blame and so, try as we might,\nwe could not tell Father Kanva that Shakuntala was married to Dushyanta and\nwas expecting a baby. Oh, what shall we do? ( _Enter_ PRIYAMVADA.)\n\n_Priyamvada_. Hurry, Anusuya, hurry! We are getting Shakuntala ready for her\njourney.\n\n_Anusuya_ ( _astonished_ ). What do you mean, my dear?\n\n_Priyamvada_. Listen. I just went to Shakuntala, to ask if she had slept well.\n\n_Anusuya_. And then------\n\n_Priyamvada_. I found her hiding her face for shame, and Father Kanva was\nembracing her and encouraging her. "My child," he said, "I bring you joy. The\noffering fell straight in the sacred fire, and auspicious smoke rose toward\nthe sacrificer. My pains for you have proved like instruction given to a good\nstudent; they have brought me no regret. This very day I shall give you an\nescort of hermits and send you to your husband."\n\n_Anusuya_. But, my dear, who told Father Kanva about it?\n\n_Priyamvada_. A voice from heaven that recited a verse when he had entered the\nfire-sanctuary.\n\n_Anusuya_ ( _astonished_ ). What did it say?\n\n_Priyamvada_. Listen. ( _Speaking in good Sanskrit_.)\n\nKnow, Brahman, that your child,  \n  Like the fire-pregnant tree,  \nBears kingly seed that shall be born  \n  For earth\'s prosperity.\n\np. 43\n\n_Anusuya_ ( _hugging_ PRIYAMVADA). I am so glad, dear. But my joy is half\nsorrow when I think that Shakuntala is going to be taken away this very day.\n\n_Priyamvada_. We must hide our sorrow as best we can. The poor girl must be\nmade happy to-day.\n\n_Anusuya_. Well, here is a cocoa-nut casket, hanging on a branch of the mango-\ntree. I put flower-pollen in it for this very purpose. It keeps fresh, you\nknow. Now you wrap it in a lotus-leaf, and I will get yellow pigment and earth\nfrom a sacred spot and blades of panic grass for the happy ceremony.\n(PRIYAMVADA _does so. Exit_ ANUSUYA.)\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. Gautami, bid the worthy Sharngarava and\nSharadvata make ready to escort my daughter Shakuntala.\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _listening_ ). Hurry, Anusuya, hurry! They are calling the\nhermits who are going to Hastinapura. ( _Enter_ ANUSUYA, _with materials for\nthe ceremony_.)\n\n_Anusuya_. Come, dear, let us go. ( _They walk about_.)\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _looking ahead_ ). There is Shakuntala. She took the ceremonial\nbath at sunrise, and now the hermit-women are giving her rice-cakes and\nwishing her happiness. Let\'s go to her. ( _They do so. Enter_ SHAKUNTALA _with\nattendants as described, and_ GAUTAMI.)\n\n_Shakuntala_. Holy women, I salute you.\n\n_Gautami_. My child, may you receive the happy title "queen," showing that\nyour husband honours you.\n\n_Hermit-women_. My dear, may you become the mother of a hero. ( _Exeunt all\nbut_ GAUTAMI.)\n\n_The two friends_ ( _approaching_ ). Did you have a good bath, dear?\n\n_Shakuntala_. Good morning, girls. Sit here.\n\n_The two friends_ ( _seating themselves_ ). Now stand straight, while we go\nthrough the happy ceremony.\n\n_Shakuntala_. It has happened often enough, but I ought to be very grateful\nto-day. Shall I ever be adorned by my friends again? (She weeps.)\n\n_The two friends_. You ought not to weep, dear, at this happy time. (They wipe\nthe tears away and adorn her.)\n\n_Priyamvada_. You are so beautiful, you ought to have the finest gems. It\nseems like .an insult to give you these hermitage things. ( _Enter_ HARITA, _a\nhermit-youth, with ornaments_.)\n\np. 44\n\n_Harita_. Here are ornaments for our lady. ( _The women look at them in\nastonishment_.)\n\n_Gautami_. Harita, my son, whence come these things?\n\n_Harita_. From the holy power of Father Kanva.\n\n_Gautami_. A creation of his mind?\n\n_Harita_. Not quite. Listen. Father Kanva sent us to gather blossoms from the\ntrees for Shakuntala, and then\n\nOne tree bore fruit, a silken marriage dress  \nThat shamed the moon in its white loveliness;  \nAnother gave us lac-dye for the feet;  \nFrom others, fairy hands extended, sweet  \nLike flowering twigs, as far as to the wrist,  \nAnd gave us gems, to adorn her as we list.\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _looking at_ SHAKUNTALA). A bee may be born in a hole in a\ntree, but she likes the honey of the lotus.\n\n_Gautami_. This gracious favour is a token of the queenly happiness which you\nare to enjoy in your husband\'s palace. (SHAKUNTALA _shows embarrassment_.)\n\n_Harita_. Father Kanva has gone to the bank of the Malini, to perform his\nablutions. I will tell him of the favour shown us by the trees. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_Anusuya_. My dear, we poor girls never saw such ornaments. How shall we adorn\nyou? ( _She stops to think, and to look at the ornaments_.) But we have seen\npictures. Perhaps we can arrange them right.\n\n_Shakuntala_. I know how clever you are. ( _The two friends adorn her. Enter_\nKANVA, _returning after his ablutions_.)\n\n_Kanva_.\n\nShakuntala must go to-day;  \n  I miss her now at heart;  \nI dare not speak a loving word  \n  Or choking tears will start.\n\nMy eyes are dim with anxious thought;  \n  Love strikes me to the life:  \nAnd yet I strove for pious peace--  \n  I have no child, no wife.\n\nWhat must a father feel, when come  \nThe pangs of parting from his child at home?\n\n( _He walks about_.)\n\np. 45\n\n_The two friends_. There, Shakuntala, we have arranged your ornaments. Now put\non this beautiful silk dress. (SHAKUNTALA _rises and does so_.)\n\n_Gautami_. My child, here is your father. The eyes with which he seems to\nembrace you are overflowing with tears of joy. You must greet him properly.\n(SHAKUNTALA _makes a shamefaced reverence_.)\n\n_Kanva_. My child,\n\nLike Sharmishtha, Yayati\'s wife,  \n  Win favour measured by your worth;  \nAnd may you bear a kingly son  \n  Like Puru, who shall rule the earth.\n\n_Gautami_. My child, this is not a prayer, but a benediction.\n\n_Kanva_. My daughter, walk from left to right about the fires in which the\noffering has just been thrown. ( _All walk about_.)\n\nThe holy fires around the altar kindle,  \n  And at their margins sacred grass is piled;  \nBeneath their sacrificial odours dwindle  \n  Misfortunes. May the fires protect you, child!\n\n(SHAKUNTALA _walks about them from left to right_.)\n\n_Kanva_. Now you may start, my daughter. ( _He glances about_.) Where are\nSharngarava and Sharadvata? ( _Enter the two pupils_.)\n\n_The two pupils_. We are here, Father.\n\n_Kanva_. Sharngarava, my son, lead the way for your sister.\n\n_Sharngarava_. Follow me. ( _They all walk about_.)\n\n_Kanva_. O trees of the pious grove, in which the fairies dwell,\n\nShe would not drink till she had wet  \nYour roots, a sister\'s duty,  \nNor pluck your flowers; she loves you yet  \nFar more than selfish beauty.\n\n\'Twas festival in her pure life  \nWhen budding blossoms showed;  \nAnd now she leaves you as a wife--  \nOh, speed her on her road!\n\np. 46\n\n_Sharngarava_ ( _listening to the song of ko il-birds_). Father,\n\nThe trees are answering your prayer  \n  In cooing cuckoo-song,  \nBidding Shakuntala farewell,  \n  Their sister for so long.\n\n_Invisible beings_.\n\nMay lily-dotted lakes delight your eye;  \n  May shade-trees bid the heat of noonday cease;  \nMay soft winds blow the lotus-pollen nigh;  \n  May all your path be pleasantness and peace.\n\n( _All listen in astonishment_.)\n\n_Gautami_. My child, the fairies of the pious grove bid you farewell. For they\nlove the household. Pay reverence to the holy ones.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _does so. Aside to_ PRIYAMVADA). Priyamvada, I long to see my\nhusband, and yet my feet will hardly move. It is hard, hard to leave the\nhermitage.\n\n_Priyamvada_. You are not the only one to feel sad at this farewell. See how\nthe whole grove feels at parting from you.\n\nThe grass drops from the feeding doe;  \n  The peahen stops her dance;  \nPale, trembling leaves are falling slow,  \n  The tears of clinging plants.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _recalling something_ ). Father, I must say good-bye to the\nspring-creeper, my sister among the vines.\n\n_Kanva_. I know your love for her. See! Here she is at your right hand.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _approaches the vine and embraces it_ ). Vine sister, embrace\nme too with your arms, these branches. I shall be far away from you after to-\nday. Father, you must care for her as you did for me.\n\n_Kanva_.\n\nMy child, you found the lover who  \n  Had long been sought by me;  \nNo longer need I watch for you;  \nI\'ll give the vine a lover true,  \n  This handsome mango-tree.\n\n[paragraph continues] And now start on your journey.\n\np. 47\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _going to the two friends_ ). Dear girls, I leave her in your\ncare too.\n\nThe two friends. But who will care for poor us? ( _They shed tears_.)\n\n_Kanva_. Anusuya! Priyamvada! Do not weep. It is you who should cheer\nShakuntala. ( _All walk about_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_. Father, there is the pregnant doe, wandering about near the\ncottage. When she becomes a happy mother, you must send some one to bring me\nthe good news. Do not forget.\n\n_Kanva_. I shall not forget, my child.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _stumbling_ ). Oh, oh! Who is it that keeps pulling at my\ndress, as if to hinder me? ( _She turns round to see_.)\n\n_Kanva_.\n\nIt is the fawn whose lip, when torn  \n  By kusha-grass, you soothed with oil;  \nThe fawn who gladly nibbled corn  \n  Held in your hand; with loving toil  \nYou have adopted him, and he  \nWould never leave you willingly.\n\n_Shakuntala_. My dear, why should you follow me when I am going away from\nhome? Your mother died when you were born and I brought you up. Now I am\nleaving you, and Father Kanva will take care of you. Go back, dear! Go back! (\n_She walks away, weeping_.)\n\n_Kanva_. Do not weep, my child. Be brave. Look at the path before you.\n\nBe brave, and check the rising tears  \n  That dim your lovely eyes;  \nYour feet are stumbling on the path  \n  That so uneven lies.\n\n_Sharngarava_. Holy Father, the Scripture declares that one should accompany a\ndeparting loved one only to the first water. Pray give us your commands on the\nbank of this pond, and then return.\n\n_Kanva_. Then let us rest in the shade of this fig-tree. ( _All do so_.) What\ncommands would it be fitting for me to lay on King Dushyanta? ( _He\nreflects_.)\n\n_Anusuya_. My dear, there is not a living thing in the whole\n\np. 48\n\nhermitage that is not grieving to-day at saying good-bye to you. Look!\n\nThe sheldrake does not heed his mate  \n  Who calls behind the lotus-leaf;  \nHe drops the lily from his bill  \n  And turns on you a glance of grief.\n\n_Kanva_. Son Sharngarava, when you present Shakuntala to the king, give him\nthis message from me.\n\nRemembering my religious worth,  \nYour own high race, the love poured forth  \nBy her, forgetful of her friends,  \nPay her what honour custom lends  \nTo all your wives. And what fate gives  \nBeyond, will please her relatives.\n\n_Sharngarava_. I will not forget your message, Father.\n\n_Kanva_ ( _turning to_ SHAKUNTALA). My child, I must now give you my counsel.\nThough I live in the forest, I have some knowledge of the world.\n\n_Sharngarava_. True wisdom, Father, gives insight into everything.\n\n_Kanva_. My child, when you have entered your husband\'s home,\n\nObey your elders; and be very kind  \nTo rivals; never be perversely blind  \nAnd angry with your husband, even though he  \nShould prove less faithful than a man might be;  \nBe as courteous to servants as you may,  \nNot puffed with pride in this your happy day:  \nThus does a maiden grow into a wife;  \nBut self-willed women are the curse of life.\n\n[paragraph continues] But what does Gautami say?\n\n_Gautami_. This is advice sufficient for a bride. ( _To_ SHAKUNTALA.) You will\nnot forget, my child.\n\n_Kanva_. Come, my daughter, embrace me and your friends.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Oh, Father! Must my friends turn back too?\n\n_Kanva_. My daughter, they too must some day be given in marriage. Therefore\nthey may not go to court. Gautami will go with you.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _throwing her arms about her father_ ). I am torn\n\np. 49\n\nfrom my father\'s breast like a vine stripped from a sandal-tree on the Malabar\nhills. How can I live in another soil? ( _She weeps_.)\n\n_Kanva_. My daughter, why distress yourself so?\n\nA noble husband\'s honourable wife,  \nYou are to spend a busy, useful life  \nIn the world\'s eye; and soon, as eastern skies  \nBring forth the sun, from you there shall arise  \nA child, a blessing and a comfort strong--  \nYou will not miss me, dearest daughter, long.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _falling at his feet_ ). Farewell, Father.\n\n_Kanva_. My daughter, may all that come to you which I desire for you.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _going to her two friends_ ). Come, girls! Embrace me, both of\nyou together.\n\n_The two friends_ ( _do so_ ). Dear, if the good king should perhaps be slow\nto recognise you, show him the ring with his own name engraved on it.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Your doubts make my heart beat faster.\n\n_The two friends_. Do not be afraid, dear. Love is timid.\n\n_Sharngarava_ ( _looking about_ ). Father, the sun is in mid-heaven. She must\nhasten.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _embracing_ KANVA _once more_ ). Father, when shall I see the\npious grove again?\n\n_Kanva_. My daughter,\n\nWhen you have shared for many years  \nThe king\'s thoughts with the earth,  \nWhen to a son who knows no fears  \nYou shall have given birth,\n\nWhen, trusted to the son you love,  \nYour royal labours cease,  \nCome with your husband to the grove  \nAnd end your days in peace.\n\n_Gautami_. My child, the hour of your departure is slipping by. Bid your\nfather turn back. No, she would never do that. Pray turn back, sir.\n\n_Kanva_. Child, you interrupt my duties in the pious grove.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Yes, Father. You will be busy in the grove. You will not miss\nme. But oh! I miss you.\n\np. 50\n\n_Kanva_. How can you think me so indifferent? ( _He sighs_.)\n\nMy lonely sorrow will not go,  \n  For seeds you scattered here  \nBefore the cottage door, will grow;  \n  And I shall see them, dear.\n\n[paragraph continues] Go. And peace go with you. (Exit SHAKUNTALA, _With_\nGAUTAMI, SHARNGARAVA, _and_ SHARADVATA.)\n\n_The two friends_ ( _gazing long after her. Mournfully_ ). Oh, oh! Shakuntala\nis lost among the trees.\n\n_Kanva_. Anusuya! Priyamvada! Your companion is gone. Choke down your grief\nand follow me. ( _They start to go back_.)\n\n_The two friends_. Father, the grove seems empty without Shakuntala.\n\n_Kanva_. So love interprets. (He walks about, sunk in thought.) Ah! I have\nsent Shakuntala away, and now I am myself again. For\n\nA girl is held in trust, another\'s treasure;  \n  To arms of love my child to-day is given;  \nAnd now I feel a calm and sacred pleasure;  \n  I have restored the pledge that came from heaven.\n\n( _Exeunt omnes_.)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act V.
