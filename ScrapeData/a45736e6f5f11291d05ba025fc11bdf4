THE MATSYA OR FISH AVAT\xc4\x80RA.\n\nThe earliest account of what was afterwards regarded as an incarnation of\nVishnu is found in the "Satapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana." It will be noticed that though in\nthis passage a wonderful fish is described, it is not said to have been an\nincarnation of any of the gods. The Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata says that Brahm\xc4\x81 assumed this\nform; whilst the Pur\xc4\x81nas teach that the fish here spoken of was Vishnu. This\ntransfer of work from one deity to another is not a matter of much surprise,\nwhen we remember how frequently it is declared that all the various gods are\nbut forms of one supreme being. "It should be noticed that the Manu here\nreferred to is regarded as a progenitor of the human race, and is represented\nas conciliating the Supreme Being by his piety in an age of universal\ndepravity." Here is the passage: *\n\n"There lived in ancient time a holy man  \n Called Manu, who, by penances and prayers,  \n Had won the favour of the lord of heaven.  \n One day they brought him water for ablution;\n\np. 135\n\n Then, as he washed his hands,. a little fish  \n Appeared, and spoke in human accents thus:  \n \'Take care of me, and I will be thy saviour.\'  \n \'From what wilt thou preserve me?\' Manu asked.  \n The fish replied, \'A flood will sweep away\n\n[![THE MATSYA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.](tn/13500.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/13500.jpg)  \nTHE MATSYA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.  \n\n All creatures; I will rescue thee from that.\'  \n \'But how shall I preserve thee?\' Manu said.  \n The fish rejoined, \'So long as we are small,  \n We are in constant danger of destruction,  \n For fish eat fish; so keep me in a jar.\n\np. 136\n\n[paragraph continues]  When I outgrow the, jar, then dig a trench,  \n And place me there; when I outgrow the trench,  \n Then take me to the ocean--I shall then  \n Be out of reach of danger.\' Having thus  \n Instructed Manu, straightway rapidly  \n The fish grew larger; then he spake again:  \n \'In such and such a year the flood will come;  \n Therefore construct a ship, and pay me homage.  \n When the flood rises, enter thou the ship,  \n And I will rescue thee.\' So Manu did  \n As he was ordered, and preserved the fish,  \n Then carried it in safety to the ocean;  \n And in the very year the fish enjoined  \n He built a ship, and paid the fish respect,  \n And there took refuge when the flood arose.  \n Soon near him swam the fish, and to its horn  \n Manu made fast the cable of his vessel.  \n Thus drawn along the waters, Manu passed  \n Beyond the northern mountain. Then the fish,  \n Addressing Manu, said, \'I have preserved thee,  \n Quickly attach the ship to yonder tree;  \n But, lest the waters sink from under thee,  \n As fast as they subside, so fast shalt thou  \n Descend the mountain gently after them.\'  \n Thus he descended front the northern mountain.  \n The flood had swept away all living creatures;  \n Manu alone was left."\n\nThe account from the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata which now follows has also been put into\nverse by Professor Monier Williams:-- *\n\n"Along the ocean in that stately ship was borne the lord of men, and through  \n Its dancing, tumbling billows, and its roaring waters; and the bark,  \n Tossed to and fro by violent winds, reeled on the surface of the deep,  \n Staggering and trembling like a drunken woman. Land was seen no more,\n\np. 137\n\n[paragraph continues]  Nor far horizon, nor the space between; for everywhere\naround  \n Spread the wild waste of waters, reeking atmosphere, and boundless sky.  \n And now when all the world was deluged, nought appeared above the waves  \n But Manu and the seven sages, and the fish that drew the bark.  \n Unwearied, thus for years on years the fish propelled the ship across  \n The heaped-up waters, till at length it bore the vessel to the peak  \n Of Himav\xc4\x81n; then softly smiling, thus the fish addressed the sage:  \n \'Haste, now, to bind thy ship to this high crag. Know me, the lord of all,  \n The great Creator Brahm\xc4\x81, mightier than all might, omnipotent.  \n BBy me, in fishlike shape, hast thou been saved in dire emergency.  \n From Manu all creation, gods, asuras, men, must be produced;  \n By him all the world must be created--that which moves and moveth not.\'"\n\nThe typical Pur\xc4\x81nic account of this Avat\xc4\x81ra is that of the "Bh\xc4\x81gavata Pur\xc4\x81na"\nwhich is given by Sir William Jones in the "Asiatic Soc. Res." * With this the\naccounts in the other Pur\xc4\x81nas agree in the main: some are more condensed,\nothers, as the "Matsya Pur\xc4\x81na," are considerably extended; for it was as the\nfish was guiding the vessel in which Manu was saved that Vishnu, in this form,\nis said to have dictated the whole of that Pur\xc4\x81na. All the Pur\xc4\x81nas agree in\nregarding the fish as an incarnation of Vishnu, and not of Brahm\xc4\x81. Now follows\nthe account from the Bh\xc4\x81gavata:--\n\n"Desiring the preservation of herds, Br\xc4\x81hmans, genii, and virtuous men--of the\nVedas, of law, and of precious things--the Lord of the Universe assumes many\nbodily shapes; but though he pervades, like the air, a variety of beings, yet\nhe is himself unvaried, since he has no qualities subject to change. At the\nclose of the last Kalpa there was a general destruction, occasioned by the\nsleeping Brahm\xc4\x81, whence his creatures in different worlds\n\np. 138\n\nwere drowned in a vast ocean. Brahm\xc4\x81 being inclined to slumber, desiring\nrepose after a lapse of ages, the strong demon Hayagriva came near him, and\nstole the Vedas, which had flowed from his lips.\n\n"When Hari, the preserver of the universe, discovered this deed of the prince\nof the D\xc4\x81navas, he took the shape of a minute fish, called S\xc4\x81phari. A holy\nking named Satyavr\xc4\x81ta then reigned--a servant of the spirit which moved on the\nwaves; and so devout, that water was his only sustenance. He was the child of\nthe Sun, and in the present Kalpa * is invested by N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana with the office of\nManu ( _i.e._ the progenitor and lord of men), by the name of Sr\xc4\x81ddhadev\xc4\x81, or\nthe god of obsequies. One day as he was making a libation in the river\nKritam\xc4\x81la, and held water in the palm of his hand, he perceived a small fish\nmoving in it. The King of Dravira immediately dropped the fish into the river,\ntogether with the water which he had taken from it; when the S\xc4\x81phari thus\naddressed the benevolent monarch: \'How canst thou, O king, who showiest\naffection to the oppressed, leave me in this river water, where I am too weak\nto resist the monsters of the stream, who fill me with dread?\' He, not knowing\nwho had assumed the form of a fish, applied his mind to the preservation of\nthe S\xc4\x81phari, both from good-nature and from regard to his own soul; and,\nhaving heard his very suppliant address, he kindly placed it under his\nprotection in a small vase full of water; but in a single night its bulk was\nso increased that it could not be contained in the jar, and thus again\naddressed the illustrious prince: I am not pleased with living miserably in\nthis little vase; make me a large mansion, where I may dwell in comfort.\' The\nking, removing it thence, placed it in the water of\n\np. 139\n\na cistern; but it grew three cubits in less than fifty minutes, and said, \'O\nking! it pleases me not to stay vainly in this narrow cistern; since thou hast\ngranted me an asylum, give me a spacious habitation.\' He then removed it and\nplaced it in a pool, where, having ample space around its body, it became a\nfish of considerable size. \'This abode, O king, is not convenient for me, who\nmust swim at large in the waters; exert thyself for my safety, and remove me\nto a deep lake!\' Thus addressed, the pious monarch threw the suppliant into a\nlake, and, when it grew of equal bulk with that piece of water, he cast the\nvast fish into the sea. When the fish was thrown into the waves, he thus again\nspoke to Satyavr\xc4\x81ta: \'Here the horned sharks and other monsters of great\nstrength will devour me; thou shouldest not, O valiant man, leave me in this\nocean.\'\n\n"Thus repeatedly deluded by the fish, who had addressed him with gentle words,\nthe king said, \'Who art thou that beguilest me in that assumed shape? Never\nbefore have I seen or heard of so prodigious an inhabitant of the waters, who,\nlike thee, has filled up in a single day a lake a hundred leagues in\ncircumference. Surely thou art Bh\xc4\x81gavat who appears before me; the great Hari,\nwhose dwelling was on the waves; and who now, in compassion to thy servants,\nbears the form of the natives of the deep. Salutation and praise to thee, O\nfirst male, the lord of creation, of preservation, of destruction! Thou art\nthe highest object, the supreme ruler, of us thy adorers, who piously seek\nthee. All thy delusive descents in this world give existence to various\nbeings; yet I am anxious to know for what cause that shape has been assumed by\nthee. Let me not, O lotus-eyed, approach in vain the feet of a deity whose\nperfect benevolence has been extended to all; when thou hast\n\np. 140\n\nshown us to our amazement the appearance of other bodies, not in reality\nexisting, but successively exhibited.\'\n\n"The lord of the universe, loving the pious man who thus implored him, and\nintending to preserve him from the sea of destruction caused by the depravity\nof the age, thus told him how he was to act: \'In seven days from the present\ntime, O thou tamer of enemies! the three worlds will be plunged in an ocean of\ndeath; but, in the midst of the destroying waves, a large vessel sent by me\nfor thy use shall stand before thee. Then thou shalt take all medicinal herbs,\nall the varieties of seeds, and accompanied by seven saints, encircled by\npairs of brute animals, thou shalt enter the spacious ark, and continue in it\nsecure from the flood, on one immense ocean without light, except the radiance\nof thy holy companions. When the ship shall be agitated with an impetuous\nwind, thou shalt fasten it with a large sea serpent on my horn; for I will be\nnear thee, drawing the vessel, with thee and thy attendants. I will remain. on\nthe ocean, O chief of men, until a night of Brahm\xc4\x81 * shall be completely\nended. Thou shalt then know my true greatness, rightly named the Supreme\nGodhead; by my favour all thy questions shall be answered, and thy mind\nabundantly instructed.\'\n\n"Hari, having thus directed the monarch, disappeared; and Satyavr\xc4\x81ta humbly\nwaited for the time which the ruler of our senses had appointed. The pious\nking having scattered toward the east the pointed blades of the grass _darbha_\n, and turning his face towards the north, sat meditating on the feet of the\ngod who had borne the form of a fish. The sea, overwhelming its shores,\ndeluged the whole earth, and it was soon perceived to be augmented by showers\nfrom immense clouds. He,\n\np. 141\n\nstill meditating on the command of Bh\xc4\x81gavat, saw the vessel advancing, and\nentered it with the chiefs of Br\xc4\x81hmans, having carried into it the medicinal\nplants, and conformed to the directions of Hari. The saints thus addressed\nhim: \'O king, meditate on Kesava; who will surely deliver us from this danger,\nand grant us prosperity.\' The god being invoked by the monarch, appeared again\ndistinctly on the vast ocean in the form. of a fish, blazing like gold,\nextending a million of leagues, with one stupendous horn; on which the king,\nas he had been before commanded by Hari, tied the ship with a cable made of a\nvast serpent, and, happy in his preservation, stood praising the destroyer of\nMadhu. When the monarch had finished his hymn, the primeval male, Bh\xc4\x81gavat,\nwho watched for his safety on the greater expanse of water, spake aloud to his\nown divine essence, pronouncing a sacred Pur\xc4\x81na [the \'Matsya Pur\xc4\x81na\'], which\ncontained the rules of the Sankhya philosophy; but it was an infinite mystery\nto be concealed within the breast of Satyavr\xc4\x81ta; who, sitting in the vessel\nwith the saints, heard the principle of soul, the Eternal Being, proclaimed by\nthe preserving power. Then Hari, rising together with Brahm\xc4\x81 from the\ndestructive deluge, which was now abated, slew the demon Hayagriva, and\nrecovered the sacred books."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[134:*](hmvp19.htm#fr_141) "Indian Wisdom," p. 32.\n\n[136:*](hmvp19.htm#fr_142) "Indian Wisdom," p. 394.\n\n[137:*](hmvp19.htm#fr_143) Vol. i. 230 ff.\n\n[138:*](hmvp19.htm#fr_144) See part ii. chap. x.\n\n[140:*](hmvp19.htm#fr_145) See part ii. chap. x.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
