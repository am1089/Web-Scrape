Our joys and sorrows lie heavy on us if we\nmerely go on accumulating them. Keeping them and accumulating them alike are\nfalse. As master of the house I am in an artificial position--in reality I am\na wayfarer on the path of life. That is why the true Master of the House gets\nhurt at every step and at last there comes the supreme hurt of death.\n\nMy union with you, my love, was only of the wayside; it was well enough so\nlong as we followed the same road; it will only hamper us if we try to\npreserve it further. We are now leaving its bonds behind. We are started on\nour journey beyond, and it will be enough if we can throw each other a glance,\nor feel the touch of each other\'s hands in passing. After that? After that\nthere is the larger world-path, the endless current of universal life.\n\nHow little can you deprive me of, my love, after all? Whenever I set my ear to\nit, I can hear the flute which is playing, its fountain of melody gushing\nforth from the flute-stops of separation. The immortal draught of the goddess\nis never exhausted. She sometimes breaks the bowl from which we drink it, only\nto smile at seeing us so disconsolate over the trifling loss. I will not stop\nto pick up my broken bowl. I will march forward, albeit with unsatisfied\nheart.\n\nThe Bara Rani came and asked me: "What is the meaning, brother, of all these\nbooks being packed up and sent off in box-loads?" "It only means," I replied,\n"that I have not yet been able to get over my fondness for them."\n\n"I only wish you would keep your fondness for some other things as well! Do\nyou mean you are never coming back home?"\n\n"I shall be coming and going, but shall not immure myself here any more."\n\n"Oh indeed! Then just come along to my room and see how many things _I_ have\nbeen unable to shake off _my_ fondness for." With this she took me by the hand\nand marched me off.\n\nIn my sister-in-law\'s rooms I found numberless boxes and bundles ready packed.\nShe opened one of the boxes and said: "See, brother, look at all my _pan_\n-making things. In this bottle I have catechu powder scented with the pollen\nof screw-pine blossoms. These little tin boxes are all for different kinds of\nspices. I have not forgotten my playing cards and draught-board either. If you\ntwo are over-busy, I shall manage to make other friends there, who will give\nme a game. Do you remember this comb? It was one of the _Swadeshi_ combs you\nbrought for me..."\n\n"But what is all this for, Sister Rani? Why have you been packing up all these\nthings?"\n\n"Do you think I am not going with you?"\n\n"What an extraordinary idea!"\n\n"Don\'t you be afraid! I am not going there to flirt with you, nor to quarrel\nwith the Chota Rani! One must die sooner or later, and it is just as well to\nbe on the bank of the holy Ganges before it is too late. It is too horrible to\nthink of being cremated in your wretched burning-ground here, under that\nstumpy banian tree--that is why I have been refusing to die, and have plagued\nyou all this time."\n\nAt last I could hear the true voice of home. The Bara Rani came into our house\nas its bride, when I was only six years old. We have played together, through\nthe drowsy afternoons, in a corner of the roof-terrace. I have thrown down to\nher green amras from the tree-top, to be made into deliciously indigestible\nchutnies by slicing them up with mustard, salt and fragrant herbs. It was my\npart to gather for her all the forbidden things from the store-room to be used\nin the marriage celebration of her doll; for, in the penal code of my\ngrandmother, I alone was exempt from punishment. And I used to be appointed\nher messenger to my brother, whenever she wanted to coax something special out\nof him, because he could not resist my importunity. I also remember how, when\nI suffered under the rigorous regime of the doctors of those days--who would\nnot allow anything except warm water and sugared cardamom seeds during\nfeverish attacks--my sister-in-law could not bear my privation and used to\nbring me delicacies on the sly. What a scolding she got one day when she was\ncaught!\n\nAnd then, as we grew up, our mutual joys and sorrows took on deeper tones of\nintimacy. How we quarrelled! Sometimes conflicts of worldly interests roused\nsuspicions and jealousies, making breaches in our love; and when the Chota\nRani came in between us, these breaches seemed as if they would never be\nmended, but it always turned out that the healing forces at bottom proved more\npowerful than the wounds on the surface.\n\nSo has a true relationship grown up between us, from our childhood up till\nnow, and its branching foliage has spread and broadened over every room and\nverandah and terrace of this great house. When I saw the Bara Rani make ready,\nwith all her belongings, to depart from this house of ours, all the ties that\nbound us, to their wide-spreading ends, felt the shock.\n\nThe reason was clear to me, why she had made up her mind to drift away towards\nthe unknown, cutting asunder all her lifelong bonds of daily habit, and of the\nhouse itself, which she had never left for a day since she first entered it at\nthe age of nine. And yet it was this real reason which she could not allow to\nescape her lips, preferring rather to put forward any other paltry excuse.\n\nShe had only this one relationship left in all the world, and the poor,\nunfortunate, widowed and childless woman had cherished it with all the\ntenderness hoarded in her heart. How deeply she had felt our proposed\nseparation I never realized so keenly as when I stood amongst her scattered\nboxes and bundles.\n\nI could see at once that the little differences she used to have with Bimala,\nabout money matters, did not proceed from any sordid worldliness, but because\nshe felt that her claims in regard to this one relationship of her life had\nbeen overridden and its ties weakened for her by the coming in between of this\nother woman from goodness knows where! She had been hurt at every turn and yet\nhad not the right to complain.\n\nAnd Bimala? She also had felt that the Senior Rani\'s claim over me was not\nbased merely on our social connection, but went much deeper; and she was\njealous of these ties between us, reaching back to our childhood.\n\nToday my heart knocked heavily against the doors of my breast. I sank down\nupon one of the boxes as I said: "How I should love, Sister Rani, to go back\nto the days when we first met in this old house of ours."\n\n"No, brother dear," she replied with a sigh, "I would not live my life again--\nnot as a woman! Let what I have had to bear end with this one birth. I could\nnot bear it over again."\n\nI said to her: "The freedom to which we pass through sorrow is greater than\nthe sorrow."\n\n"That may be so for you men. Freedom is for you. But we women would keep\nothers bound. We would rather be put into bondage ourselves. No, no, brother,\nyou will never get free from our toils. If you needs must spread your wings,\nyou will have to take us with you; we refuse to be left behind. That is why I\nhave gathered together all this weight of luggage. It would never do to allow\nmen to run too light."\n\n"I can feel the weight of your words," I said laughing, "and if we men do not\ncomplain of your burdens, it is because women pay us so handsomely for what\nthey make us carry."\n\n"You carry it," she said, "because it is made up of many small things.\nWhichever one you think of rejecting pleads that it is so light. And so with\nmuch lightness we weigh you down ... When do we start?"\n\n"The train leaves at half past eleven tonight. There will be lots of time."\n\n"Look here, do be good for once and listen to just one word of mine. Take a\ngood nap this afternoon. You know you never get any sleep in the train. You\nlook so pulled down, you might go to pieces any moment. Come along, get\nthrough your bath first."\n\nAs we went towards my room, Khema, the maid, came up and with an ultra-modest\npull at her veil told us, in deprecatingly low tones, that the Police\nInspector had arrived with a prisoner and wanted to see the Maharaja.\n\n"Is the Maharaja a thief, or a robber," the Bara Rani flared up, "that he\nshould be set upon so by the police? Go and tell the Inspector that the\nMaharaja is at his bath."\n\n"Let me just go and see what is the matter," I pleaded. "It may be something\nurgent."\n\n"No, no," my sister-in-law insisted. "Our Chota Rani was making a heap of\ncakes last night. I\'ll send some to the Inspector, to keep him quiet till\nyou\'re ready." With this she pushed me into my room and shut the door on me.\n\nI had not the power to resist such tyranny--so rare is it in this world. Let\nthe Inspector while away the time eating cakes. What if business is a bit\nneglected?\n\nThe police had been in great form these last few days arresting now this one,\nnow that. Each day some innocent person or other would be brought along to\nenliven the assembly in my office-room. One more such unfortunate, I supposed,\nmust have been brought in that day. But why should the Inspector alone be\nregaled with cakes? That would not do at all. I thumped vigorously on the\ndoor.\n\n"If you are going mad, be quick and pour some water over your head--that will\nkeep you cool," said my sister-in-law from the passage.\n\n"Send down cakes for two," I shouted. "The person who has been brought in as\nthe thief probably deserves them better. Tell the man to give him a good big\nhelping."\n\nI hurried through my bath. When I came out, I found Bimal sitting on the floor\noutside.  30 Could this be my Bimal of old, my proud, sensitive Bimal?\n\nWhat favour could she be wanting to beg, seated like this at my door?\n\nAs I stopped short, she stood up and said gently with downcast eyes: "I would\nhave a word with you."\n\n"Come inside then," I said.\n\n"But are you going out on any particular business?"\n\n"I was, but let that be. I want to hear ..."\n\n"No, finish your business first. We will have our talk after you have had your\ndinner."\n\nI went off to my sitting-room, to find the Police Inspector\'s plate quite\nempty. The person he had brought with him, however, was still busy eating.\n\n"Hullo!" I ejaculated in surprise. "You, Amulya?"\n\n"It is I, sir," said Amulya with his mouth full of cake. "I\'ve had quite a\nfeast. And if you don\'t mind, I\'ll take the rest with me." With this he\nproceeded to tie up the remaining cakes in his handkerchief.\n\n"What does this mean?" I asked, staring at the Inspector.\n\nThe man laughed. "We are no nearer, sir," he said, "to solving the problem of\nthe thief: meanwhile the mystery of the theft deepens." He then produced\nsomething tied up in a rag, which when untied disclosed a bundle of currency\nnotes. "This, Maharaja," said the Inspector, "is your six thousand rupees!"\n\n"Where was it found?"\n\n"In Amulya Babu\'s hands. He went last evening to the manager of your Chakna\nsub-office to tell him that the money had been found. The manager seemed to be\nin a greater state of trepidation at the recovery than he had been at the\nrobbery. He was afraid he would be suspected of having made away with the\nnotes and of now making up a cock-and-bull story for fear of being found out.\nHe asked Amulya to wait, on the pretext of getting him some refreshment, and\ncame straight over to the Police Office. I rode off at once, kept Amulya with\nme, and have been busy with him the whole morning. He refuses to tell us where\nhe got the money from. I warned him he would be kept under restraint till he\ndid so. In that case, he informed me he would have to lie. Very well, I said,\nhe might do so if he pleased. Then he stated that he had found the money under\na bush. I pointed out to him that it was not quite so easy to lie as all that.\nUnder what bush? Where was the place? Why was he there?--All this would have\nto be stated as well. \'Don\'t you worry,\' he said, \'there is plenty of time to\ninvent all that.\'"\n\n"But, Inspector," I said, "why are you badgering a respectable young gentleman\nlike Amulya Babu?"\n\n"I have no desire to harass him," said the Inspector. "He is not only a\ngentleman, but the son of Nibaran Babu, my school-fellow. Let me tell you,\nMaharaja, exactly what must have happened. Amulya knows the thief, but wants\nto shield him by drawing suspicion on himself. That is just the sort of\nbravado he loves to indulge in." The Inspector turned to Amulya. "Look here,\nyoung man," he continued, "I also was eighteen once upon a time, and a student\nin the Ripon College. I nearly got into gaol trying to rescue a hack driver\nfrom a police constable. It was a near shave." Then he turned again to me and\nsaid: "Maharaja, the real thief will now probably escape, but I think I can\ntell you who is at the bottom of it all."\n\n"Who is it, then?" I asked.\n\n"The manager, in collusion with the guard, Kasim."\n\nWhen the Inspector, having argued out his theory to his own satisfaction, at\nlast departed, I said to Amulya: "If you will tell me who took the money, I\npromise you no one shall be hurt."\n\n"I did," said he.\n\n"But how can that be? What about the gang of armed men?..."\n\n"It was I, by myself, alone!"\n\nWhat Amulya then told me was indeed extraordinary. The manager had just\nfinished his supper and was on the verandah rinsing out his mouth. The place\nwas somewhat dark. Amulya had a revolver in each pocket, one loaded with blank\ncartridges, the other with ball. He had a mask over his face. He flashed a\nbull\'s-eye lantern in the manager\'s face and fired a blank shot. The man\nswooned away. Some of the guards, who were off duty, came running up, but when\nAmulya fired another blank shot at them they lost no time in taking cover.\nThen Kasim, who was on duty, came up whirling a quarterstaff. This time Amulya\naimed a bullet at his legs, and finding himself hit, Kasim collapsed on the\nfloor. Amulya then made the trembling manager, who had come to his senses,\nopen the safe and deliver up six thousand rupees. Finally, he took one of the\nestate horses and galloped off a few miles, there let the animal loose, and\nquietly walked up here, to our place.\n\n"What made you do all this, Amulya?" I asked.\n\n"There was a grave reason, Maharaja," he replied.\n\n"But why, then, did you try to return the money?"\n\n"Let her come, at whose command I did so. In her presence I shall make a clean\nbreast of it."\n\n"And who may \'she\' be?"\n\n"My sister, the Chota Rani!"\n\nI sent for Bimala. She came hesitatingly, barefoot, with a white shawl over\nher head. I had never seen my Bimal like this before. She seemed to have\nwrapped herself in a morning light.\n\nAmulya prostrated himself in salutation and took the dust of her feet. Then,\nas he rose, he said: "Your command has been executed, sister. The money is\nreturned."\n\n"You have saved me, my little brother," said Bimal.\n\n"With your image in my mind, I have not uttered a single lie," Amulya\ncontinued. "My watchword _Bande Mataram_ has been cast away at your feet for\ngood. I have also received my reward, your _prasad_ , as soon as I came to the\npalace."\n\nBimal looked at him blankly, unable to follow his last words. Amulya brought\nout his handkerchief, and untying it showed her the cakes put away inside. "I\ndid not eat them all," he said. "I have kept these to eat after you have\nhelped me with your own hands."\n\nI could see that I was not wanted here. I went out of the room. I could only\npreach and preach, so I mused, and get my effigy burnt for my pains. I had not\nyet been able to bring back a single soul from the path of death. They who\nhave the power, can do so by a mere sign. My words have not that ineffable\nmeaning. I am not a flame, only a black coal, which has gone out. I can light\nno lamp. That is what the story of my life shows--my row of lamps has remained\nunlit.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[30](hw46.htm#fr_29) Sitting on the bare floor is a sign of mourning, and so,\nby association of ideas, of an abject attitude of mind.
