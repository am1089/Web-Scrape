let not Rama wait,  \nBut speed, the sage to venerate.\'  \n   Then with the pupil Lakshman went  \nAcross the hermit settlement,  \nAnd showed him Rama where he stood  \nWith Janak\'s daughter in the wood.  \nThe pupil then his message spake  \nWhich the kind hermit bade him take;  \nThen led the honoured Rama thence  \nAnd brought him in with reverence.  \nAs nigh the royal Rama came  \nWith Lakshman and the Maithil dame,  \nHe viewed the herds of gentle deer  \nRoaming the garden free from fear.  \nAs through the sacred grove he trod  \nHe viewed the seat of many a God,  \nBrahma and Agni,  1 Sun and Moon,  \nAnd His who sends each golden boon;  2  \nHere Vishnu\'s stood, there Bhaga\'s  3 shrine,  \nAnd there Mahendra\'s Lord divine;  \nHere His who formed this earthly frame, 4  \nHis there from whom all beings came.  5  \nVayu\'s, 6 and His who loves to hold  \nThe great noose, Varim  7 mighty-souled:  \nHere was the Vasus\' 8 shrine to see,  \nHere that of sacred Gayatri, 9  \nThe king of serpents  10 here had place,  \nAnd he who rules the feathered race.  11  \nHere Kartikeya,  12 warrior lord,  \nAnd there was Justice\' King adored.  \nThen with disciples girt about  \nThe mighty saint himself came out:  \nThrough fierce devotion bright as flame  \nBefore the rest the Master came:  \nAnd then to Lakshman, fortune blest,  \nRama these hasty words addressed:  \n\'Behold, Agastya\'s self draws near,  \nThe mighty saint, whom all revere:  \nWith spirit raised I meet my lord  \nWith richest wealth of penance stored.\'  \n   The strong-armed hero spake, and ran  \nForward to meet the sunbright man.  \nBefore him, as he came, he bent  \nAnd clasped his feet most reverent,  \nThen rearing up his stately height  \nStood suppliant by the anchorite,  \nWhile Lakshman\'s strength and Sita\'s grace  \nStood by the pride of Raghu\'s race.  \n\np. 244  \n\nThe sage his arms round Rama threw  \nAnd welcomed him with honours due,  \nAsked, was all well, with question sweet.  \nAnd bade the hero to a seat.  \nWith holy oil he fed the flame,  \nHe brought the gifts which strangers claim,  \nAnd kindly waiting on the three  \nWith honours due to high degree,  \nHe gave with hospitable care  \nA simple hermit\'s woodland fare.  \nThen sat the reverend father, first  \nOf hermits, deep in duty versed.  \nAnd thus to suppliant Rama, bred  \nIn all the lore of virtue, said:  \n\'Did the false hermit, Prince, neglect  \nTo hail his guest with due respect,  \nHe must,--the doom the perjured meet,--  \nHis proper flesh hereafter eat.  \nA car-borne king a lord who sways  \nThe earth, and virtue\'s law obeys,  \nWorthy of highest honour, thou  \nHast sought, dear guest, my cottage now.\'  \nHe spoke: with fruit and hermit fare,  \nWith every bloom the branches bare,  \nAgastya graceed his honoured guest,  \nAnd thus with gentle words addressed:  \n\'Accept this mighty bow, divine.  \nWhereon red gold and diamonds shine;  \n\'Twas by the Heavenly Artist planned  \nFor Vishnu\'s own almighty hand:  \nThis God-sent shaft of sunbright hue,  \nWhose deadly flight is ever true,  \nBy Lord Mahendra given of yore:  \nThis quiver with its endless store.  \nKeen arrows hurtling to their aim  \nLike kindled fires that flash and flame:  \nAccept, in golden sheath encased,  \nThis sword with hilt of rich gold graced.  \nArmed, whilom, with this best of bows  \nLord Vishnu slew his demon foes,  \nAnd mid the dwellers in the skies  \nWon brilliant glory for his prize.  \nThe bow, the quivers, shaft, and sword  \nReceived from me, O glorious lord:  \nThese conquest to thine arm shall bring,  \nAs thunder to the thunder\'s King.\'  \n   The splendid hermit bade him take  \nThe noble weapons as he spake,  \nAnd as the prince accepted each  \nIn words like these renewed his speech:  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[243:1](ry210.htm#fr_429) The God of fire.\n\n[243:2](ry210.htm#fr_430) Kuera, the God of riches.\n\n[243:3](ry210.htm#fr_431) The Sun.\n\n[243:4](ry210.htm#fr_432) Brahma, the creator.\n\n[243:5](ry210.htm#fr_433) Siva.\n\n[243:6](ry210.htm#fr_434) The Wind-God.\n\n[243:7](ry210.htm#fr_435) The God of the sea.\n\n[243:8](ry210.htm#fr_436) A class of demi-gods, eight in number.\n\n[243:9](ry210.htm#fr_437) The holiest text of the Vedas, deified.\n\n[243:10](ry210.htm#fr_438) Vasaki\n\n[243:11](ry210.htm#fr_439) Garnd *\n\n[243:12](ry210.htm#fr_440) The War-God.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XIII.: Agastya\'s Counsel.](ry211.htm)\n\n'
