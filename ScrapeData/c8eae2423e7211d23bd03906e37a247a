For the text denies the previously declared so-muchness; and declares\nmore than that.\n\nIt is impossible to understand the text 'not so, not so' as negativing those\ndistinctions of Brahman which had been stated previously. If the text meant\nthat, it would be mere idle talk. For none but a person not in his right mind\nwould first teach that all the things mentioned in the earlier part of the\nsection are distinctive attributes of Brahman--as which they are not known by\nany other\n\np. 616\n\nmeans of proof--and thereupon deliberately negative his own teaching. Although\namong the things mentioned there are some which, in themselves, are known\nthrough other means of proof, yet they are not thus known to be modes of\nBrahman, and others again are known neither in themselves nor as modes of\nBrahman. The text therefore cannot merely refer to them as things otherwise\nknown, but gives fundamental instruction about them. Hence the later passage\ncannot be meant as a sheer negation, but must be taken as denying the\npreviously described 'so-muchness' of Brahman; i.e. the passage denies that\nlimited nature of Brahman which would result from Brahman being viewed as\ndistinguished by the previously stated attributes only. The word _so_ refers\nto that limited nature, and the phrase _not so_ therefore means that Brahman\nis not distinguished by the previously stated modes _only_. This\ninterpretation is further confirmed by the fact that after that negative\nphrase further qualities of Brahman are declared by the text: 'For there is\nnot anything higher than this _not so_. Then comes the name, the _True of the\nTrue_ ; for the pra _n_ as are the True, and he is the True of them.' That\nmeans: Than that Brahman which is expressed by the phrase 'not so' there is no\nother thing higher, i.e. there is nothing more exalted than Brahman either in\nessential nature or in qualities. And of that Brahman the name is the 'True of\nthe True.' This name is explained in the next clause, 'for the pra _n_ as,'\n&c. The term pra _n_ as here denotes the individual souls, so called because\nthe pra _n_ as accompany them. They are the 'True' because they do not, like\nthe elements, undergo changes implying an alteration of their essential\nnature. And the highest Self is the 'True of the True' because while the souls\nundergo, in accordance with their karman, contractions and expansions of\nintelligence, the highest Self which is free from all sin knows of no such\nalternations. He is therefore more eminently _true_ than they are. As thus the\ncomplementary passage declares Brahman to be connected with certain qualities,\nthe clause 'not so, not so' (to which that passage is complementary) cannot\ndeny that Brahman possesses\n\np. 617\n\ndistinctive attributes, but only that Brahman's nature is confined to the\nattributes previously stated.--Brahman therefore possesses the twofold\ncharacteristics. That the clause 'not so' negatives Brahman's being fully\ndescribed by the attributes previously mentioned, was above proved on the\nground that since Brahman is not the object of any other means of proof, those\nprevious statements cannot refer to what is already proved, and that the final\nclause cannot therefore be meant to deny what the previous clauses expressly\nteach. The next Sutra now confirms this circumstance of Brahman not lying\nwithin the sphere of the other means of proof.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 22.
