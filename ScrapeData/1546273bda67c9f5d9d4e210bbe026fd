Fulfilled be this  \nmy hope: be that my portion!  \n3 Give us, Brihaspati, that wondrous treasure, that which  \nexceeds the merit of the foeman,  \nWhich shines among the folk effectual, splendid, that, Son  \nof Law, which is with might refulgent.  \nTaken upon a base art thou. Thee for Brihaspati. This is  \nthy home. Thee for Brihaspati,  \n4 Come hither, Indra, rich in kine! Drink Soma, Lord of  \nHundred Powers,  \nEffused by braying pressing-stones.  \nTaken upon a base art thou. Thee for Indra, rich in kine.  \nThis is thy home. Thee for Indra, rich in kine.\n\np. 232\n\n5 O Indra, Vritra-slayer, come. Drink Soma, Lord of  \nHundred Powers,  \nExpressed with stones whose wealth is kine.  \nTaken upon a base art thou, etc., as in verse 4.  \n6 Vaisvanara the righteous One, the Lord of sacrifice and light,  \nThe heat that wasteth not, we seek.  \nTaken upon a base art thou. Thee for Vaisvanara.  \nThis is thy home: thee for Vaisvanara.  \n7 Still in Vaisvanara's grace may we continue: yea, he is  \nKing Supreme o\xc2\x92er all things living.  \nSprung hence to life upon this All he looketh. Vaisvanara  \nhath rivalry with Surya.  \nTaken upon a base art thou, etc., as in verse 6.  \n8 Hitherward come Vaisvanara to succour us from far away,  \nAgni through laud that brings him near!  \nTaken upon a base, etc, as in verse 6.  \n9 Agni is Pavamana, Sage, the Tribe-Priest of the Races Five:  \nTo him of mighty wealth we pray.  \nTaken upon a base art thou. Thee for lustre. This is thy  \nhome. Thee for lustre.  \n10 May mighty Indra, thunder-armed, may Shodasi protect us  \nwell, and slay the wicked man who hateth us.  \nTaken upon a base art thou. Thee for Mahendra. This is  \nthy home. Thee for Mahendra.  \n11 As cows low to their calves in stalls so with our songs we  \nglorify  \nThis Indra, e\xc2\x92en your wondrous God who checks assault,  \nwho joys in the delicious juice.  \n12 Agni's is the most fetching song. Shine mightily, thou rich  \nin light!  \nLike the Chief Consort of a King, riches and strength proceed  \nfrom thee.\n\np. 233\n\n13 Come, here, O Agni, will I sing verily other songs to thee,  \nAnd with these drops shalt thou grow strong.  \n14 The Seasons spread thy sacrifice! the Mouths protect thine  \noffering!  \nMay the Year guard our sacrifice for thee and keep our children  \nsafe.  \n15 There where the mountains downward slope, there by the  \nmeeting of the streams  \nThe sage was manifest with song.  \n16 High is thy juice's birth: though sat in heaven, on earth it  \nhath obtained  \nStrong sheltering power and great renown.  \n17 Finder of room and freedom, flow for Indra, meet for worship,  \nflow  \nFor Varuna and the Marut host.  \n18 Striving to win, with him we gain all wealth of the ungodly  \none,  \nYea, all the glories of mankind.  \n19 May we be prosperous with brave sons, cattle, horses, each  \nwish of ours, and varied blessings,  \nWith quadrupeds, and with the men about us. May the  \nGods guide our sacrifice in season.  \n20 O Agni, bring thou hitherward the yearning Consorts of the  \nGods  \nBring Tvashtar to the Soma-draught.  \n21 O Neshtar girt by Dames, accept our sacrifice: with Ritu  \ndrink,  \nFor thou art he who giveth wealth.\n\np. 234\n\n22 He with the Ritus fain would drink, Wealth-river, from the  \nNeshtar's bowl.  \nBegin, pay offerings: hasten ye.  \n28 Thine is this Soma: come thou near, approach it. Drink  \nthou thereof, benevolent, and cease not.  \nSit on the sacred grass at this our worship, and take these  \ndrops into thy belly, Indra.  \n24 Come unto us, ye swift to listen! as at home, upon the  \nsacred grass sit and enjoy yourselves.  \nAnd, Tvashtar, well content be joyful in the juice with Gods  \nand Goddesses in gladsome company.  \n25 In sweetest and most gladdening stream flow pure, O Soma,  \non thy way,  \nPressed out for Indra, for his drink.  \n26 Fiend-queller, Friend of all men, he hath in the vat attained  \nunto  \nHis place, his iron-fashioned home.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XXVII](wyvbk27.htm)\n\n"
