Removal of a house that has been presented to a priest as\nsacrificial reward.\n\n1\\. The fastenings of the buttresses, the supports, and also of the\nconnectinc, beams of the house, that abounds in treasures, do we loosen.  \n2\\. O (house) rich in all treasures! the fetter which has been bound about\nthee, and the knot which has been fastened upon thee, that with my charm do I\nundo, as Brihaspati (undid) Vala.  \n3\\. (The builder) has drawn thee to,,ether, pressed thee together, placed firm\nknots upon thee. Skilfully, as the priest who butchers (the sacrificial\nanimal), do we with Indra's aid disjoint thy limbs.  \n4\\. From thy beams, thy bolts, thy frame, and thy thatch; from thy sides, (O\nhouse) abounding in treasures, do we loosen the fastenings.  \n5\\. The fastenings of the dove-tailed (joints), of the reed (-covering), of\nthe frame-work, do we loosen here from the 'mistress of dwelling.'  \n6\\. The ropes which they have tied within thee for comfort, these do we loosen\nfrom thee; be thou propitious to our persons, O mistress of dwelling, after\nthou hast (again) been erected!  \n7\\. A receptacle for Soma, a house for Agni, a seat for the mistresses (of the\nhouse), a seat (for the priests), a seat for the gods art thou, O goddess\nhouse!  \n8\\. Thy covering of wicker-work, with thousand eyes, stretched out upon thy\ncrown, fastened down and laid on, do we loosen with (this) charm.  \n9\\. He who receives thee as a gift, O house, and he by whom thou hast been\nbuilt, both these, O mistress of dwelling, shall live attaining old age!  \n10\\. Return to him in the other world, firmly bound, ornamented, (thou house),\nwhich we loosen limb by limb, and joint by joint!  \n11\\. He who built thee, O house, brought together (thy) timbers, he, a\nPragapati on high, did construct thee, O house, for his progeny (pragayai).  \n12\\. We render obeisance to him (the builder); obeisance to the giver, the\nlord of the house; obeisance to Agni who serves (the sacrifice); and obeisance\nto thy (attendant) man!  \n13\\. Reverence to the cattle and the horses, and to that which is born in the\nhouse! Thou that hast produced, art rich in offspring, thy fetters do we\nloosen.  \n14\\. Thou dost shelter Agni within, (and) the domestics together with the\ncattle. Thou that hast produced, art rich in offspring, thy fetters do we\nloosen.  \n15\\. The expanse which is between heaven and earth, with that do I receive as\na gift this house of thine; the middle region which is stretched out from the\nsky, that do I make into a receptacle for treasures; with that do I receive\nthe house for this one.  \n16\\. Full of nurture, full of milk, fixed upon the earth, erected, holding\nfood for all, O house, do thou not injure them that receive thee as a gift!  \n17\\. Enveloped in grass, clothed in reeds, like night does the house lodge the\ncattle; erected thou dost stand upon the earth, like a she-elephant, firm of\nfoot.  \n18\\. The part of thee that was covered with mats unfolding do I loosen. Thee\nthat hast been enfolded by Varuna may Mitra uncover in the morning!  \n19\\. The house built with pious word, built by seers, erected--may Indra and\nAgni, the two immortals, protect the house, the seat of Soma!  \n20\\. Chest is crowded upon chest, basket upon basket; there mortal man is\nbegotten from whom all things spring.  \n21\\. In the house which is built with two facades, four facades, six facades;\nin the house with eight facades, with ten facades, in the 'mistress of\ndwelling.' Agni rests as if in the womb.  \nTuirning towards thee that art turned towards me, O house, I come to thee that\ninjurest me not. For Agni and the waters, the first door to divine order, are\nwithin.  \n23\\. These waters, free from disease, destructive of disease, do I bring here.\nThe chambers do I enter in upon in company with the immortal Agni (fire).  \n24\\. Do thou not fasten a fetter upon us; though a heavy load, become thou\nlight! As a bride do we carry thee, O house, wherever we please.  \n25\\. From the easterly direction of the house reverence (be) to greatness,\nhail to the gods who are to be addressed with hail!  \n26\\. From the southerly direction of the house, &c.!  \n27\\. From the westerly direction of the house, &c.!  \n28\\. From the northerly direction of the house, &c.!  \n29\\. From the firm direction (nadir) of the house, &c.!  \n30\\. From the upright direction (zenith) of the house, &c.!  \n3 1. From every direction of the house reverence (be) to greatness, hail to\nthe gods who are to be addressed with hail!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 71.
