III, 222-224.--34. M. XII, 76.\n\n4\\. Nand. derives the term Raurava from 'ruru, a kind of serpent.' But it\nseems preferable to connect it with the root ru, 'to howl.'\n\n6\\. This hell is defined by Nand. as a kind of threshing-place, made of\ncopper, burning hot, and measuring ten thousand Yo _g_ anas.\n\n8\\. In this hell those who have perished in consequence of the tortures which\nthey had to undergo are restored to life and tortured anew. (Nand.)]\n\np. 141\n\n10\\. Tapana (burning);\n\n11\\.

Dipanadi (flame river);\n\n21\\. Asipattravana (sword-leaved forest);\n\n22\\. Loha _k_ araka (iron fetters);\n\n23\\. In each of those (hells) successively criminals in the highest degree,\nwho have not performed the penance (prescribed for their crime), are tormented\nfor the time of a Kalpa.\n\n24\\. Mortal sinners (who have not done penance) for a Manvantara;\n\n25\\. Minor offenders, for the same period;\n\n[12. in this hell a large number of individuals is packed up closely in a very\nnarrow space. (Nand.)\n\n13\\. In this hell the sinners are devoured by ravens. (Nand.)\n\n14\\. In this hell the sinners are put in sacks, which are tied up at the end.\n(Nand.)\n\n17\\. In this hell the sinners are roasted. (Nand.)\n\n20\\. This river, which contains hot water, is called Vaitara _n_ i, as it is\nsaid, The river called Vaitara _n_ i has a stinking odour, is full of blood,\nand is moving on swiftly a torrent of hot water, carrying bones and hair in\nits course.' (Nand.) A detailed description of the river Vaitara _n_ i may be\nfound in the Garu _d_ a-pura _n_ a, p. 8 (Bombay ed., 1863).\n\n22\\. 'The particle iti is added here, in order to include in the above\nenumeration the hells called Savisha, Mahapatha, Kumbhipaka, Taptabaluka, and\nthe rest.' (Nand.) See Y. III, 223, 224; M. XII, 76.]\n\np. 142\n\n26\\. Criminals in the fourth degree, for the period of a _K_ aturyuga;\n\n27\\. Those who have committed a crime effecting loss of caste, for a thousand\nyears;\n\n28\\. Those who have committed a crime degrading to a mixed caste, for the same\nperiod;\n\n29\\. Those likewise who have committed a crime rendering unworthy to receive\nalms and the like.\n\n30\\. And those who have committed a crime causing defilement;\n\n31\\. Those who have committed one of the miscellaneous crimes, for a great\nnumber of years;\n\n32\\. All sinners who have committed (one of those nine kinds of) crimes have\nto suffer terrible pangs, when they have departed life and entered upon the\npath of Yama.\n\n33\\. Being dragged hither and thither (upon even and uneven roads), by the\ndire ministers of Yama, they are conducted (to hell by them), with menacing\n\n34\\. (There) they are devoured by dogs and jackals, by hawks, crows, herons,\ncranes, and other (carnivorous animals), by (bears and other) animals having\nfire in their mouth, and by serpents and scorpions.\n\n35\\. They are scorched by blazing fire, pierced by thorns, divided into parts\nby saws, and tormented by thirst.\n\n36\\. They are agitated by hunger and by fearful troops of tigers, and faint\naway. at every step on account of the foul stenches proceeding from pus and\nfrom blood.\n\n[31. 'A great number of years' means three hundred years. (Nand.)]\n\np. 143\n\n37\\. Casting wistful glances upon the food and drink of others, they receive\nblows from ministers (of Yama), whose faces are similar to those of crows,\nherons, cranes, and other horrid animals.\n\n38\\. Here they are boiled in oil, and there pounded with pestles, or ground in\niron or stone vessels.\n\n39\\. In one place they (are made to) eat what has been vomited, or pus, or\nblood, or excrements, and in another place, meat of a hideous kind, smelling\nlike pus.\n\n40\\. Here, enveloped in terrible darkness, they are devoured by worms and\n(jackals and other) horrible animals having flames in their mouth.\n\n41\\. There again they are tormented by frost, or have to step through unclean\nthings (such as excrements), or the departed spirits eat one another, driven\nto distraction (by hunger).\n\n42\\. In one place they are beaten with their deeds in a former existence, in\nanother they are suspended (by trees and the like, with a rope), or shot with\nheaps of arrows, or cut in pieces.\n\n43\\. In another place again, walking upon thorns, and their bodies being\nencircled by snakes, they are tormented with (grinding) machines, and dragged\non by their knees.\n\n44\\. Their backs, heads, and shoulders are fractured, the necks of these poor\nbeings are not stouter than a needle, and their bodies, of a size fit for a\nhut only, are unable to bear torments.\n\n45\\. Having thus been tormented (in the hells) and suffered most acute pain,\nthe sinners have to\n\n[43. The Garu _d_ a-pura _n_ a, (p. 17) also mentions that in one hell the\nsinners are thrown into machines like the sugar-cane.]\n\np. 144\n\nendure further pangs in their migration through animal bodies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XLIV.](sbe07046.htm)\n\n"
