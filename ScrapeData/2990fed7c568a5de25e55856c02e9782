Open\nthat, O Pushan 4, that we may see the nature of the True 5.\n\n2\\. O Pushan, only seer, Yama (judge), Surya (sun), son of Pra _g_ apati 6,\nspread thy rays and gather them!\n\np. 200\n\nThe light which is thy fairest form, I see it. I am what he is (viz. the\nperson in the sun).\n\n3\\. Breath to air and to the immortal! Then this my body ends in ashes. Om!\nMind, remember! Remember thy deeds! Mind, remember! Remember thy deeds 1!\n\n4\\. Agni, lead us on to wealth (beatitude) by a good path 2, thou, O God, who\nknowest all things! Keep far from us crooked evil, and we shall offer thee the\nfullest praise! (Rv. I, 189, 1.)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[199:2](sbe15093.htm#fr_584) These verses, which are omitted here in the\nMadhyandina text, are found at the end of the Va _g_ asaneyi-upanishad 15-18.\nThey are supposed to be a prayer addressed to \xc3\x82ditya by a dying person.\n\n[199:3](sbe15093.htm#fr_585) Mahidhara on verse 17: The face of the true\n(purusha in the sun), is covered by a golden disk.' _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains here\nmukha, face, by mukhya _m_ svarupam, the principal form or nature.\n\n[199:4](sbe15093.htm#fr_586) Pushan is here explained as a name of Savit _ri_\n, the sun; likewise all the names in the next verse.\n\n[199:5](sbe15093.htm#fr_587) Cf. Maitr. Up. VI, 35.\n\n[199:6](sbe15093.htm#fr_588) Of \xc3\x8e _s_ vara or Hira _n_ yagarbha.\n\n[200:1](sbe15093.htm#fr_589) The Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita reads: Om, krato\nsmara, _k_ _li_ be smara, k _ri_ ta _m_ smara. Uva _t_ a holds that Agni,\nfire, who has been worshipped in youth and manhood, is here invoked in the\nform of mind, or that kratu is meant for sacrifice. 'Agni, remember me 'Think\nof the world! Remember my deeds!' K _li_ be is explained by Mahidhara as a\ndative of k _li_ p, k _li_ p meaning loka, world, what is made to be enjoyed\n(kalpyate bhogaya).\n\n[200:2](sbe15093.htm#fr_590) Not by the Southern path, the dark, from which\nthere is a fresh return to life.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 1](sbe15094.htm)\n\n"
