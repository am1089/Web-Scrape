As this king sat in judgment, a monk called Patience\nbrought him every day one piece of fruit as an expression of homage. And the\nking took it and gave it each day to the treasurer who stood near. Thus twelve\nyears passed.\n\nNow one day the monk came to court, gave the king a piece of fruit as usual,\nand went away. But on this day the king gave the fruit to a pet baby monkey\nthat had escaped from his keepers, and happened to wander in. And as the\nmonkey ate the fruit, he split it open, and a priceless, magnificent gem came\nout. When the king saw this, he took it and asked the treasurer: "Where have\nyou been keeping the fruits which the monk brought? I gave them to you."\n\nWhen the treasurer heard this, he was frightened and said: "Your Majesty, I\nhave thrown them all through the window. If your Majesty desires, I will look\nfor them now." And when the king had dismissed him, he went, but returned in a\nmoment, and said again: "Your Majesty, they were all smashed in the treasury,\nand in them I see heaps of dazzling gems."\n\nWhen he heard this, the king was delighted, and gave the jewels to the\ntreasurer. And when the monk came the next day, he asked him: "Monk, why do\nyou keep honouring me in such an expensive way? Unless I know the reason, I\nwill not take your fruit."\n\nThen the monk took the king aside and said: "O hero, there is a business in\nwhich I need help. So I ask for your help in it, because you are a brave man."\nAnd the king promised his assistance. Then the monk was pleased, and said\nagain: "O King, on the last night of the waning moon, you must go to the great\ncemetery at nightfall, and come to me under the fig-tree."\n\nThen the king said: "Certainly," and Patience, the monk, went home well\npleased.\n\nSo when the night came, the mighty king remembered his promise to the monk,\nand at dusk he wrapped his head in a black veil, took his sword in his hand,\nand went to the great cemetery without being seen. When he got there, he\nlooked about, and saw the monk standing under the fig-tree and making a magic\ncircle.\n\nSo he went up and said: "Monk, here I am. Tell me what I am to do for you."\n\nAnd when the monk saw the king, he was delighted and said: "O King, if you\nwish to do me a favour, go south from here some distance all alone, and you\nwill see a sissoo tree and a dead body hanging from it. Be so kind as to bring\nthat here."\n\nWhen the brave king heard this, he agreed, and, true to his promise, turned\nsouth and started. And as he walked with difficulty along the cemetery road,\nhe came upon the sissoo tree at some distance, and saw a body hanging on it.\nSo he climbed the tree, cut the rope, and let it fall to the ground. And as it\nfell, it unexpectedly cried aloud, as if alive. Then the king climbed down,\nand thinking it was alive, he mercifully rubbed its limbs. Then the body gave\na loud laugh.\n\nSo the king knew that a goblin lived in it, and said without fear: "What are\nyou laughing about? Come, let us be off."\n\nBut then he did not see the goblin on the ground any longer. And when he\nlooked up, there he was, hanging in the tree as before. So the king climbed\nthe tree again, and carefully carried the body down. A brave man\'s heart is\nharder than a diamond, and nothing makes it tremble.\n\nThen he put the body with the goblin in it on his shoulder, and started off in\nsilence. And as he walked along, the goblin in the body said: "O King, to\namuse the journey, I will tell you a story. Listen."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: First Goblin: The Prince\'s Elopement.
