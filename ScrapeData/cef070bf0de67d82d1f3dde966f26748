VIII.\n\nHow Vishn\xcc\x81u is to be worshipped, as related by Aurva to Sagara. Duties of the\nfour castes, severally and in common: also in time of distress.\n\nMAITREYA.--Inform me, venerable teacher, how the supreme deity, the lord of\nthe universe, Vishn\xcc\x81u, is worshipped by those who are desirous of overcoming\nthe world; and what advantages are reaped by men, assiduous in his adoration,\nfrom the propitiated Govinda.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The question you have asked was formerly put by Sagara to Aurva 1.\nI will repeat to you his reply.\n\nSagara having bowed down before Aurva, the descendant of Bhrigu, asked him\nwhat were the best means of pleasing Vishn\xcc\x81u, and what would be the\nconsequence of obtaining his favour. Aurva replied, "He who pleases Vishn\xcc\x81u\nobtains all terrestrial enjoyments; heaven and a place in heaven; and what is\nbest of all, final liberation: whatever he wishes, and to whatever extent,\nwhether much or little, he receives it, when Achyuta is content with him. In\nwhat manner his favour is to be secured, that also I will, oh king, impart to\nyou, agreeably to your desire. The supreme Vishn\xcc\x81u is propitiated by a man who\nobserves the institutions of caste, order, and purificatory practices: no\nother path is the way to please him. He who offers sacrifices, sacrifices to\nhim; he who murmurs prayer, prays to him; he who injures living creatures,\ninjures him; for Hari is all beings. Janarddana therefore is propitiated by\nhim\n\np. 291\n\nwho is attentive to established observances, and follows the duties prescribed\nfor his caste. The Brahman, the Kshatriya, the Vai\xc5\x9bya, and the \xc5\x9audra, who\nattends to the rules enjoined his caste, best worships Vishn\xcc\x81u. Ke\xc5\x9bava is most\npleased with him who does good to others; who never utters abuse, calumny, or\nuntruth; who never covets another\'s wife or another\'s wealth, and who bears\nill-will towards none; who neither beats nor slays any animate or inanimate\nthing; who is ever diligent in the service of the gods, of the. Brahmans, and\nof his spiritual preceptor; who is always desirous of the welfare of all\ncreatures, of his children, and of his own soul; in whose pure heart no\npleasure is derived from the imperfections of love and hatred. The man, oh\nmonarch, who conforms to the duties enjoined by scriptural authority for every\ncaste and condition of life, is he who best worships Vishn\xcc\x81u: there is no\nother mode."\n\nAurva having thus spoken, Sagara said to him, "Tell me then, venerable\nBrahman, what are the duties of caste and condition 2: I am desirous of\nknowing them." To which Aurva answered and said, "Attentively listen to the\nduties which I shall describe as those severally of the Brahman, the\nKshatriya, the Vai\xc5\x9bya, and the \xc5\x9audra. The Brahman should make gifts, should\nworship the gods with sacrifices, should be assiduous in studying the Vedas,\nshould perform ablutions and libations with water, and should preserve the\nsacred flame. For the sake of subsistence he may offer sacrifices on behalf of\nothers, and may instruct them in the \xc5\x9aastras; and he may accept presents of a\nliberal description in a becoming manner (or from respectable persons, and at\nan appropriate season). He must ever seek to promote the good of others, and\ndo evil unto none; for the best riches of a Brahman are universal benevolence.\nHe should look upon the jewels of another person as if they\n\np. 292\n\nwere pebbles; and should, at proper periods, procreate offspring by his wife.\nThese are the duties of a Brahman.\n\n"The man of the warrior tribe should cheerfully give presents to Brahmans,\nperform various sacrifices, and study the scriptures. His especial sources of\nmaintenance are arms and the protection of the earth. The guardianship of the\nearth is indeed his especial province: by the discharge of this duty a king\nattains his objects, and realizes a share of the merit of all sacrificial\nrites. By intimidating the bad, and cherishing the good, the monarch who\nmaintains the discipline of the different castes secures whatever region he\ndesires.\n\n"Brahma, the great parent of creation, gave to the Vai\xc5\x9bya the occupations of\ncommerce and agriculture, and the feeding of flocks and herds, for his means\nof livelihood; and sacred study, sacrifice, and donation are also his duties,\nas is the observance of fixed and occasional rites.\n\n"Attendance upon the three regenerate castes is the province of the \xc5\x9audra, and\nby that he is to subsist, or by the profits of trade, or the earnings of\nmechanical labour. He is also to make gifts; and he may offer the sacrifices\nin which food is presented, as well as obsequial offerings 3.\n\np. 293\n\n"Besides these their respective obligations, there are duties equally\nincumbent upon all the four castes. These are, the acquisition of property,\nfor the support of their families; cohabitation with their wives, for the sake\nof progeny; tenderness towards all creatures, patience, humility, truth,\npurity, contentment, decency of decoration, gentleness of speech,\nfriendliness; and freedom from envy and repining, from avarice, and from\ndetraction. These also are the duties of every condition of life.\n\n"In times of distress the peculiar functions of the castes may be modified, as\nyou shall hear. A Brahman may follow the occupations of a Kshatriya or a\nVai\xc5\x9bya; the Kshatriya may adopt those of the Vai\xc5\x9bya; and the Vai\xc5\x9bya those of\nthe Kshatriya: but these two last should never descend to the functions of the\n\xc5\x9audra, if it be possible to avoid them 4; and if that be not possible, they\nmust at least shun the functions of the mined castes. I will now, Raja, relate\nto you the duties of the several \xc3\x81sramas or conditions of life."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[290:1](vp082.htm#fr_817) Sagara, as we shall see, was a king of the solar\nrace. Aurva was a sage, the grandson of Bhrigu. When the sons of king\nKritavirya persecuted and slew the children of Bhrigu, to recover the wealth\nwhich their father had lavished upon them, they destroyed even the children in\nthe womb. One of the women of the race of Bhrigu, in order to preserve her\nembryo, secreted it in her thigh (Uru), whence the child on his birth was\nnamed Aurva: from his wrath proceeded a flame, that threatened to destroy the\nworld; but at the persuasion of his ancestors he cast it into the ocean, where\nit abode with the face of a horse. Aurva was afterwards religious preceptor to\nSagara, and bestowed upon him the \xc3\x81gneyastram, or fiery weapon, with which he\nconquered the tribes of barbarians, who had invaded his patrimonial\npossessions. Mahabh. \xc3\x81di Parvan, Dana Dharma P., Hari [Van\xc5\x9ba](errata.htm#13).\n\n[291:2](vp082.htm#fr_818) Most of the Puran\xcc\x81as, especially the Kurma, Padma,\nVamana, Agni, and Garud\xcc\x81a, contain chapters or sections more or less in detail\nupon the moral and ceremonial duties of the Hindus; and a considerable portion\nof the Mahabharata, especially in the Moksha Dharma Parvan, is devoted to the\nsame subject. No other Pauran\xcc\x81ik work, however, contains a series of chapters\nexactly analogous to those which follow, and which contain a compendious and\nsystematic description of the \xc3\x81charas, or personal and social obligations of\nthe Hindus. The tenor of the whole is conformable to the institutes of Manu,\nand many passages are the same.\n\n[292:3](vp082.htm#fr_819) The Pakayajna, or sacrifice in which food is\noffered, implies either the worship of the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas, the rites of\nhospitality, or occasional oblations, on building a house, the birth of a\nchild, or any occasion of rejoicing. It is to be understood, however, that\nthis injunction intends his performing these ceremonies through the agency of\na Brahman, as a \xc5\x9audra cannot repeat the Mantras or prayers that accompany\nthem; and it might be a question how far he might be present, for he ought not\neven to hear such prayers repeated. The performance of funeral rites involves\nsome personal share, and the \xc5\x9audra must present the cakes, but it must be done\nwithout Mantras; as the Mitakshara; \'This rite (the presentation of cakes)\nmust be performed by the \xc5\x9audras, without formula:, on the twelfth day.\' The\nVayu P. directs the performance of the five great sacrifices by \xc5\x9audras, only\nomitting the Mantras: It may be suspected that the Puran\xcc\x81as relaxed in some\ndegree from the original rigour; for it may be inferred that the great\nceremonies were altogether withheld from \xc5\x9audras in the time of Manu, who\ndeclares that none have any right or part (Adhikara) in his code except those\nwho perform rites with Mantras, or the three regenerate castes (II. 16); and\ndenounces as heinous sins teaching the p. 293 Vedas to \xc5\x9audras, performing\nsacrifices for them, or taking gifts from them. X. 309, 110, 111. Yajnawalkya,\nhowever, allows them to perform five great rites with the Namaskara, or the\nsimple salutation: which Gotama confirms. Some restrict the sense of Mantra,\nalso, to the prayers of the Vedas, and allow the \xc5\x9audras to use those of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as; as \xc5\x9aulapani: and the Titthi Tatwa is cited in the \xc5\x9audra Kamalakara\nas allowing them any Mantras except those of the Vedas.\n\n[293:4](vp082.htm#fr_820) This last clause reconciles what would else appear\nto be an incompatibility with Manu, who permits the Vai\xc5\x9bya in time of distress\nto descend to the servile acts of a \xc5\x9audra.
