It is the chief among the sciences, the chief among the mysteries.\nIt is the best means of sanctification. It is imperishable, not\n\np. 82\n\nopposed to the sacred law. It is to be apprehended directly 1, and is easy to\npractise. O terror of your foes! those men who have no faith in this holy\ndoctrine, return to the path of this mortal world, without attaining to me.\nThis whole universe is pervaded by me in an unperceived form. All entities\nlive in me, but I do not live in them 2. Nor yet do all entities live in me.\nSee my divine power. Supporting all entities and producing all entities, my\nself lives not in (those) entities. As the great and ubiquitous atmosphere\nalways remains in space, know that similarly all entities live in me 3. At the\nexpiration of a Kalpa, O son of Kunti! all entities enter my nature; and at\nthe beginning of a Kalpa, I again bring them forth. Taking the control of my\nown nature 4, I bring forth again and again this whole collection of entities,\nwithout a will of its own 5, by the power of nature. But, O Ar _g_ una! these\nactions do not fetter 6 me, who remain like one unconcerned, and who am\nunattached to those actions. Nature gives birth to movables and immovables\nthrough me, the supervisor, and by reason of that 7, O son of Kunti! the\nuniverse revolves. Deluded people of vain hopes, vain acts, vain\n\np. 83\n\nknowledge 1, whose minds are disordered, and who are inclined to the delusive\nnature of Asuras and Rakshasas, not knowing my highest nature as great lord of\nall entities, disregard me as I have assumed a human body 2. But the high-\nsouled ones, O son of P _ri_ tha! who are inclined to the godlike nature,\nknowing me as the inexhaustible source of (all) entities, worship me with\nminds not (turned) elsewhere.\n\nConstantly glorifying me, and exerting themselves 3, firm in their vows 4, and\nsaluting me with reverence,\n\nthey worship me, being always devoted. And others again, offering up the\nsacrifice of knowledge, worship me as one, as distinct, and as all-pervading\nin numerous forms 5. I am the Kratu 6, I am the Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1a, I am the Svadha, I\nthe product of the herbs. I am the sacred verse. I too am the sacrificial\nbutter, and I the fire, I the offering 7. I am the father of this universe,\nthe mother, the creator, the grandsire, the thing to be known, the means of\nsanctification, the syllable Om 8, the _Rik_ , Saman, and Ya _g_ us also; the\ngoal, the sustainer, the lord, the supervisor, the\n\np. 84\n\nresidence 1, the asylum, the friend, the source, and that in which it merges,\nthe support, the receptacle, and the inexhaustible seed. I cause heat and I\nsend forth and stop showers. I am immortality and also death; and I, O Ar _g_\nuna! am that which is and that which is not 2. Those who know the three\n(branches of) knowledge, who drink the Soma juice, whose sins are washed away,\noffer sacrifices and pray to me for a passage into heaven; and reaching the\nholy world of the lord of gods, they enjoy in the celestial regions the\ncelestial pleasures of the gods. And having enjoyed that great heavenly world,\nthey enter the mortal world when (their) merit is exhausted 3. Thus those who\nwish for objects of desire, and resort to the ordinances of the three (Vedas),\nobtain (as the fruit) going and coming. To those men who worship me,\nmeditating on me and on no one else, and who are constantly devoted, I give\nnew gifts and preserve what is acquired by them 4. Even those, O son of Kunti!\nwho being devotees of other divinities worship with faith, worship me only,\n(but) irregularly 5. For I am the enjoyer as well as the lord 6 of all\nsacrifices. But they know me not truly, therefore do they fall 7. Those who\nmake vows 8 to the gods go to the gods;\n\np. 85\n\nthose who make vows to the manes go to the manes, those who worship the Bhutas\ngo to the Bhutas; and those likewise who worship me go to me. Whoever with\ndevotion offers me leaf, flower, fruit, water, that, presented with devotion,\nI accept from him whose self is pure. Whatever you do, O son of Kunti!\nwhatever you eat, whatever sacrifice you make, whatever you give, whatever\npenance you perform, do that as offered to me 1. Thus will you be released\nfrom the bonds of action, the fruits of which are agreeable or disagreeable.\nAnd with your self possessed of (this) devotion, (this) renunciation 2, you\nwill be released (from the bonds of action) and will come to me. I am alike to\nall beings; to me none is hateful, none dear. But those who worship me with\ndevotion (dwell) in me 3, and I too in them. Even if a very ill-conducted man\nworships me, not worshipping any one else, he must certainly be deemed to be\ngood, for he has well resolved 4. He soon becomes devout of heart, and obtains\nlasting tranquillity. (You may) affirm, O son of Kunti! that my devotee is\nnever ruined. For, O son of P _ri_ tha! even those who are of sinful birth 5,\nwomen, Vai _s_ yas; and _S_ udras likewise, resorting to me, attain the\nsupreme goal. What then (need\n\np. 86\n\nbe said of) holy Brahma _n_ as and royal saints who are (my) devotees? Coming\nto this transient unhappy [1](sbe0812.htm#fn_341) world, worship me. (Place\nyour) mind on me, become my devotee, my worshipper; reverence me, and thus\nmaking me your highest goal, and devoting your self to abstraction, you will\ncertainly come to me.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[81:1](sbe0810.htm#fr_310) Cf.
