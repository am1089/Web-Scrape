On account of meditation, Badari thinks.\n\nThe teacher Badari thinks that the representation in the text of the supreme\nSelf in the form of a man is for the purpose of devout meditation. \'He who in\nthis way meditates on that Vai _s_ vanara Self as "prade _s_ amatra" and\n"abhivimana," he eats food in all worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs.\' What\nthis text enjoins is devout meditation for the purpose of reaching Brahman.\n\'In this way\' means \'as having a human form.\' And \'the eating\' of food in all\nworlds, &c. means the gaining of intuitional knowledge of Brahman which abides\neverywhere and is in itself of the nature of supreme bliss. The special kind\nof food, i.e. the special objects of enjoyment which belong to the different\nSelfs standing under the influence of karman cannot be meant here; for those\nlimited objects have to be shunned by those who desire final release. A\nfurther question arises. If Vai _s_ vanara is the highest Self, how can the\ntext say that the altar is its chest, the grass on the altar its hairs, and so\n\np. 294\n\non? (V, 18, 2.)
