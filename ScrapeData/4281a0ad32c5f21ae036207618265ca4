The instruction (given by Indra about himself) (is possible) through\ninsight based on Scripture, as in the case of Vamadeva.\n\nThe instruction which, in the passages quoted, Indra gives as to the object of\nmeditation, i.e. Brahman constituting his Self, is not based on such an\ninsight into his own nature as is established by other means of proof, but on\nan intuition of his own Self, mediated by Scripture. \'Having entered into them\nwith this living Self let me evolve names and forms\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2);\n\'In it all that exists has its Self ( _Kh_. Up.VI, 8, 7); Entered within, the\nruler of creatures, the Self of all\' (Taitt. Ar. III, 21); \'He who dwelling in\nthe Self is different from the Self,\' &c. (B _ri_. Up.\n\np. 253\n\n[paragraph continues] III, 7, 22)--from these and similar texts Indra has\nlearned that the highest Self has the indiviual souls for its body, and that\nhence words such as \'I\' and \'thou,\' which denote individual beings, extend in\ntheir connotation up to the highest Self; when, therefore, he says, \'Know me\nonly\', and \'Meditate on me\', he really means to teach that the highest Self,\nof which his own individual person is the body, is the proper object of\nmeditation. \'As in the case of Vamadeva.\' As the _Ri_ shi Vamadeva perceiving\nthat Brahman is the inner Self of all, that all things constitute its body,\nand that the meaning of words denoting a body extends up to the principle\nembodied, denotes with the word \'I\' the highest Brahman to which he himself\nstands in the relation of a body, and then predicates of this \'I\' Manu Surya\nand other beings--\'Seeing this the _Ri_ shi. Vamadeva understood, I am Manu, I\nam Surya\' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10). Similarly Prahlada says, \'As the Infinite\none abides within all, he constitutes my "I" also; all is from me, I am all,\nwithin me is all.\' (Vi. Pu. I, 19, 85.) The next Sutra states, in reply to an\nobjection, the reason why, in the section under discussion, terms denoting the\nindividual soul, and others denoting non-sentient things are applied to\nBrahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 32.
