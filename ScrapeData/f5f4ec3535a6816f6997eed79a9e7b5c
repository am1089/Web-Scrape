On account of such consequences in reabsorption (the Vedanta-texts would\nbe) inappropriate.\n\nThe term 'reabsorption' here stands as an instance of all the states of\nBrahman, reabsorption, creation, and so on--among which it is the first as\nappears from the texts giving instruction about those several states 'Being\nonly was this in the beginning'; 'The Self only was this in the beginning.' If\nwe accept the doctrine of the oneness of substance of cause and effect, then,\nabsorption, creation, &c. of the world all being in Brahman, the different\nstates of the world would connect themselves with Brahman, and the latter\nwould thus be affected by all the imperfections of its effect; in the same way\nas all the attributes of the bracelet are present in the gold also. And the\nundesirable consequence of this would be that contradictory attributes as\npredicated in different Vedanta-texts would have to be attributed to one and\nthe same substance; cp. 'He who is all-knowing' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); 'Free from\nsin, free from old age and death' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 5); 'Of him there is\nknown neither cause nor effect' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 8); 'Of these two one eats\nthe sweet fruit' ( _S_ vet. Up. IV, 6); 'The Self that is not a Lord is bound\nbecause he has to enjoy' ( _S_ vet. Up. I, 8); 'On account of his impotence he\nlaments, bewildered' ( _S_ vet. Up. IV, 7).--Nor can we accept the explanation\nthat, as Brahman in its causal as well as its effected state has all sentient\nand non-sentient beings for its body; and as all imperfections inhere in that\nbody only, they do not touch Brahman in either its causal or effected state.\nFor it is not possible that the world and Brahman should stand to each other\nin the relation of effect and cause, and if it were possible, the\nimperfections due to connexion with a body would necessarily cling to Brahman.\nIt is not, we say, possible that the intelligent and non-ntelligent beings\ntogether should constitute the body of Brahman. For a body is a particular\naggregate of earth\n\np. 420\n\nand the other elements, depending for its subsistence on vital breath with its\nfive modifications, and serving as an abode to the sense-organs which mediate\nthe experiences of pleasure and pain retributive of former works: such is in\nVedic and worldly speech the sense connected with the term 'body.' But\nnumerous Vedic texts--'Free from sin, from old age and death' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 1); 'Without eating the other one looks on' ( _S_ vet. Up. IV, 6);\n'Grasping without hands, hasting without feet, he sees without eyes, he hears\nwithout ears' ( _S_ vet. Up. III, 19); 'Without breath, without mind' (Mu. Up.\nII, 1, 2)--declare that the highest Self is free from karman and the enjoyment\nof its fruits, is not capable of enjoyment dependent on sense-organs, and has\nno life dependent on breath: whence it follows that he cannot have a body\nconstituted by all the non-sentient and sentient beings. Nor can either non-\nsentient beings in their individual forms such as grass, trees, &c., or the\naggregate of all the elements in their subtle state be viewed as the abode of\nsense-activity (without which they cannot constitute a body); nor are the\nelements in their subtle state combined into earth and the other gross\nelements (which again would be required for a body). And sentient beings which\nconsist of mere intelligence are of course incapable of all this, and hence\neven less fit to constitute a body. Nor may it be said that to have a body\nmerely means to be the abode of fruition, and that Brahman may possess a body\nin this latter sense; for there are abodes of fruition, such as palaces and\nthe like, which are not considered to be bodies. Nor will it avail, narrowing\nthe last definition, to say that that only is an abode of enjoyment directly\nabiding in which a being enjoys pain and pleasure; for if a soul enters a body\nother than its own, that body is indeed the abode in which it enjoys the pains\nand pleasures due to such entering, but is not admitted to be in the proper\nsense of the word the _body_ of the soul thus entered. In the case of the\nLord, on the other hand, who is in the enjoyment of self-established supreme\nbliss, it can in no way be maintained that he must be joined to a body,\nconsisting of all sentient and non-sentient\n\np. 421\n\nbeings, for the purpose of enjoyment.--That view also according to which a\n'body' means no more than a _means_ of enjoyment is refuted hereby.\n\nYou will now possibly try another definition, viz. that the body of a being is\nconstituted by that, the nature, subsistence and activity of which depend on\nthe will of that being, and that hence a body may be ascribed to the Lord in\nso far as the essential nature, subsistence, and activity of all depend on\nhim.--But this also is objectionable; since in the first place it is not a\nfact that the nature of a body depends on the will of the intelligent soul\njoined with it; since, further, an injured body does not obey in its movements\nthe will of its possessor; and since the persistence of a dead body does not\ndepend on the soul that tenanted it. Dancing puppets and the like, on the\nother hand, are things the nature, subsistence, and motions of which depend on\nthe will of intelligent beings, but we do not on that account consider them to\nbe the bodies of those beings. As, moreover, the nature of an eternal\nintelligent soul does not depend on the will of the Lord, it cannot be its\nbody under the present definition.--Nor again can it be said that the body of\na being is constituted by that which is exclusively ruled and supported by\nthat being and stands towards it in an exclusive subservient relation ( _s_\nesha); for this definition would include actions also. And finally it is a\nfact that several texts definitely declare that the Lord is without a body,\n'Without hands and feet he grasps and hastens' &c.\n\nAs thus the relation of embodied being and body cannot subsist between Brahman\nand the world, and as if it did subsist, all the imperfections of the world\nwould cling to Brahman; the Vedanta--texts are wrong in teaching that Brahman\nis the material cause of the world.\n\nTo this prima facie view the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9.
