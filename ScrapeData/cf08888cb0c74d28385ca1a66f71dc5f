For this very reason (the individual soul is) intelligent.\n\nOwing to the conflicting views of the philosophical schools there arises a\ndoubt whether, as the followers of Ka _n_ ada think, the soul is in itself\nnon-intelligent, so that its intelligence is merely adventitious; or if. as\nthe Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khyas think, eternal intelligence constitutes its very nature.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the intelligence of the Self is adventitious,\nand is produced by the conjunction of the Self with the mind (manas), just as,\nfor instance, the quality of redness is produced in a jar by the conjunction\nof the jar with fire. For if the soul were of eternal (essential)\nintelligence, it would remain intelligent in the states of deep sleep, swoon,\nand possession, while as a matter of fact, men when waking from sleep and so\non declare in reply to questions addressed to them that they were not\nconscious of anything. Men in their ordinary state, on the other hand, are\nseen to be (actively) intelligent. Hence, as intelligence\n\np. 34\n\nis clearly intermittent, we conclude that the Self's intelligence is\nadventitious only.\n\nTo this reply that the soul is of eternal intelligence, for that very reason\nthat it is not a product but nothing else but the unmodified highest Brahman\nwhich, owing to the contact with its limiting adjuncts, appears as individual\nsoul. That intelligence constitutes the essential nature of the highest\nBrahman, we know from scriptural passages such as 'Brahman is knowledge and\nbliss' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 28, 7); 'Brahman is true, knowledge, infinite'\n(Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'Having neither inside nor outside, but being altogether a\nmass of knowledge' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 13). Now, if the individual soul is\nnothing but that highest Brahman, then eternal intelligence constitutes the\nsoul's essential nature also, just as light and heat constitute the nature of\nfire. In the chapter treating of that which consists of knowledge, there are,\nmoreover, passages (directly declaring that the individual soul is of the\nnature of self- luminous intelligence), 'He not asleep himself looks down upon\nthe sleeping (senses)' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 11); 'That person is self-\nilluminated' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 14); 'For there is no intermission of the\nknowing of the knower' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 30). That the soul's nature is\nintelligence, follows moreover from the passage ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 4) where\nit is represented as connected with knowledge through all sense-organs, 'He\nwho knows let me smell this, he is the Self,' &c. &c.--From the soul's\nessential nature being intelligence it does not follow that the senses are\nuseless; for they serve the purpose of determining the special object of each\nsense, such as smell and so on. This is expressly declared by scripture,\n'Smell is for the purpose of perceiving odour' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 4).--The\nobjection that sleeping persons are not conscious of anything is refuted by\nscripture, where we read concerning a man lying in deep sleep, 'And when there\nhe does not see, yet he is seeing through he does not see. For there is no\nintermission of the seeing of the seer, because it cannot perish. But there is\nthen no second, nothing else different from him that he could see' (B _ri_.\nUp. IV, 3, 23). That means:\n\np. 35\n\n[paragraph continues] The absence of actual intelligising is due to the\nabsence of objects, not to the absence of intelligence; just as the light\npervading space is not apparent owing to the absence of things to be\nilluminated, not to the absence of its own nature.--The reasoning of the Vai\n_s_ eshikas and others is, as contradicting scripture, merely fallacious, and\nwe therefore decide that eternal intelligence is the essential nature of the\nsoul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 19](sbe38020.htm)\n\n"
