 \nWhat mean these signs of rare delight  \nOn every side that meet my sight?  \nSay, will the king with joy elate  \nSome happy triumph celebrate?'  \n\nThe nurse, with transport uncontrolled,  \nHer glad tale to the hump-back told:  \n'Our lord the king to-morrow morn  \nWill consecrate his eldest-born,  \nAnd raise, in Pushya's favouring hour,  \nPrince Rama to the royal power.'  \nAs thus the nurse her tidings spoke,  \nRage in the hump-back's breast awoke.  \nDown from the terrace, like the head  \nOf high Kailasa's hill, she sped.  \nSin in her thoughts, her soul aflame,  \nWhere Queen Kaikeyi slept, she came:  \n\np. 97  \n\n'Why sleepest thou?' she cried, 'arise,  \nPeril is near, unclose thine eyes.  \nAh, heedless Queen, too blind to know  \nWnat floods of sin above thee flow!  \nThy boasts of love and grace are o'er:  \nThine is the show and nothing more.  \nHis favour is an empty cheat,  \nA torrent dried by summer's heat.'  \n\nThus by the artful maid addressed  \nIn cruel words from raging breast,  \nThe queen, sore troubled, spoke in turn;  \n'What evil news have I to learn?  \nThat mournful eye, that altered cheek  \nOf sudden woe or danger speak.'  \n\nSuch were the words Kaikeyi said:  \nThen Manthara, her eyeballs red  \nWith fury, skilled with treacherous art  \nTo grieve yet more her lady's heart,  \nFrom Rama, in her wicked hate,  \nKaikeyi's love to alienate,  \nUpon her evil purpose bent  \nBegan again most eloquent:  \n'Peril awaits thee swift and sure,  \nAnd utter woe defying cure;  \nKing Das'aratha will create  \nPrince Rama Heir Associate.  \nPlunged in the depths of wild despair,  \nMy soul a prey to pain and care,  \nAs though the flames consumed me, zeal  \nHas brought me for my lady's weal,  \nThy grief, my Queen, is grief to me:  \nThy gain my greatest gain would be.  \nProud daughter of a princely line,  \nThe rights of consort queen are thine.  \nHow art thou, born of royal race,  \nBlind to the crimes that kings debase!  \nThy lord is gracious, to deceive,  \nAnd flatters, but thy soul to grieve,  \nWhile thy pure heart that thinks no sin  \nKnows not the snares that hem thee in.  \nThy husband's lips on thee bestow  \nSoft soothing word, an empty show:  \nThe wealth, the substance, and the power  \nThis day will be Kaus'alya's dower.  \nWith crafty soul thy child he sends  \nTo dwell among thy distant friends,  \nAnd, every rival far from sight,  \nTo Rama gives the power and might.  \nAh me! for thou, unhappy dame,  \nDeluded by a husband's name,  \nWith more than mother's love hast pressed  \nA serpent to thy heedless breast,  \nAnd cherished him who works thee woe,  \nNo husband but a deadly foe.  \nFor like a snake, unconscious Queen,  \nOr enemy who stabs unseen,  \nKing Das'aratha all untrue  \nHas dealt with thee and Bharat too.  \nAh, simple lady, long beguiled  \nBy his soft words who falsely smiled!  \nPoor victim of the guileless breast,  \nA happier fate thou meritest.  \nFor thee and thine destruction waits  \nWhen he Prince Rama consecrates.  \nUp, lady, while there yet is time;  \nPreserve thyself, prevent the crime.  \nUp, from thy careless ease, and free  \nThyself, O Queen, thy son, and me!'  \n\nDelighted at the words she said,  \nKaikeyi lifted from the bed,  \nLike autumn's moon, her radiant head,  \nAnd joyous at the tidings gave  \nA jewel to the hump-back slave;  \nAnd as she gave the precious toy  \nShe cried in her exceeding joy:  \n'Take this, dear maiden, for thy news  \nMost grateful to mine ear, and choose  \nWhat grace beside most fitly may  \nThe welcome messenger repay.  \nI joy that Rama gains the throne:  \nKaus'alya's son is as mine own.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto VIII: Manthara's Speech.](ry086.htm)\n\n"
