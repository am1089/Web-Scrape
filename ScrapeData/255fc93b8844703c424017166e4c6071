On account of connexion, thus elsewhere also.\n\nIn the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka (V, 5) it is said that Brahman is to be\nmeditated upon as abiding within the orb of the sun and within the right eye;\nand then the text mentions two secret names of Brahman-- _aham_ and _ahar_.\nHere the Purvapakshin holds that both these names are to be comprehended in\neach of the two meditations 'On account of connexion,' i.e. on account of the\nobject of meditation, i.e. Brahman being one only, although connected with\ndifferent abodes, it is 'thus elsewhere also,' i.e. the same conclusion which\nhad been arrived at in the case of the _S_ a _nd_ ilya-vidyas, has to be\naccepted with regard to Brahman abiding in the sun and in the eye. The\nmeditation is one only, and hence the two secret names apply to Brahman in\nboth its abodes.--This view the next Sutra negatives.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 21.
