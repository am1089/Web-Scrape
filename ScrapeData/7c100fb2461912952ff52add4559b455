This leads to a detail of the geographical\nsystem of the Puran\xcc\x81as, with mount Meru, the seven circular continents, and\ntheir surrounding oceans, to the limits of the world; all of which are\nmythological fictions, in which there is little reason to imagine that any\ntopographical truths are concealed. With regard to Bharata, or India, the case\nis different: the mountains and rivers which are named are readily verifiable,\nand the cities and nations that are particularized may also in many instances\nbe proved to have had a real existence. The list is not a very long one in the\nVishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, and is probably abridged from some more ample detail like\nthat which the Mahabharata affords, and which, in the hope of supplying\ninformation' with respect to a subject yet imperfectly investigated, the\nancient political condition of India, I have inserted and elucidated.\n\nThe description which this book also contains of the planetary and other\nspheres is equally mythological, although occasionally presenting practical\ndetails and notions in which there is an approach to accuracy. The concluding\nlegend of Bharata--in his former life the king so named, but now a Brahman,\nwho acquires true wisdom, and thereby attains liberation--is palpably an\ninvention of the compiler, and is peculiar to this Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Third Book](vp027.htm)\n\n"
