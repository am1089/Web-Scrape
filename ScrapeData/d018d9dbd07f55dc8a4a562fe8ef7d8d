On the passing away of the effected (world of Brahman) (the souls go)\ntogether with the ruler of that (world) to what is higher than that; on\naccount of scriptural declaration.\n\nWhen the reabsorption of the effected Brahman world draws near, the souls in\nwhich meanwhile perfect knowledge has sprung up proceed, together with Hira\n_n_ yagarbha the ruler of that world, to 'what is higher than that i.e. to the\npure highest place of Vishnu.
