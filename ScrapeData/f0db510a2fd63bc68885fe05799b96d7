Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Knower of Brahma! O Narada! The ashes prepared\nfrom ordinary fire are secondary (Gau _n_ a). The greatness of this secondary\nashes is to be considered by no means trifling; this also destroys the darkest\nignorance and reveals the highest knowledge. It is of various kinds. Amongst\nthe secondary ashes, that prepared from Virajagni is the best; it is\nequivalent to that obtained from Agnihotra Yaj\xc3\xb1a and it is as glorious. The\nashes obtained from the marriage sacrificial fire, that obtained from the\nburning of the Samidh fuel, what is obtained from the conflagration of fire\nare known as the secondary ashes. The Brahma _n_ as, K _s_ attriyas and\nVais'yas should use the ashes from the Agnihotra and the Viraja Fire. For the\nhouseholders, the ashes from the marriage sacrificial fire are good. For the\nBrahmacharis, the ashes from the Samid fuel are good and for the S\xc2\x92udras the\nfire of the cooking place of the Veda knowing Brahma _n_ as is good. For the\nother persons, the ashes obtained from the conflagration of fire are good. Now\nI will talk of the origin of the ashes obtained from the Viraja fire. The\nchief season of the Viraja fire sacrifice is the Full-moon night with Chitra\nasterism with the Moon. If this does not take place, the sacrifice may be\nperformed at other seasons; and it should be remembered that the fit place is\nwhere one adopts as one's dwelling place. The auspicious field, garden or\nforest is also commendable for the above sacrifice. On the Trayodas'i Tithi,\nthe thirteenth night preceding the full-moon night, one is to complete one's\nbathing and Sandhya; then one is to worship one's Guru and bow down before\nHim. Then, receiving his permission, the sacrificer is to put on pure clothing\nand perform the special Puja. Then with his white sacrificial thread, white\ngarlands, and white sandal paste one is to sit on the Kus'a seat with\nsacrificial (Kus'a) grass in one's hands. With his face towards the east or\nnorth he is to perform Pra _n_ ayama thrice.\n\n\n\np. 1080\n\n\n\nThen he is to meditate on S\xc2\x92iva and Bhagavati and get mentally their\npermissions. \xc2\x93O Deva Bhagavan! O Mother Bhagavati! I will perform this vow for\nmy life-time.\xc2\x94 Thus making the resolve, he should start with this sacrifice.\nBut this is to be known that this Vrata can be performed for twelve years, for\nsix years, for three years, for one year, for six months, for twelve days, for\nsix days, for three days, even at least for one day. But in every case, he\nmust take mentally the permission of the Deva and the Devi. Now, to perform\nthe Viraja Homa, one is to light the fire according to one's Grihya Sutras and\nthen perform Homa with ghee, Samidh (fuel) or with charu (an oblation of rice,\nmilk, and sugar boiled together). Then on the fourteenth lunar day\n(Chaturdas'i) one is to pray \xc2\x93Let the tattvas (principles) in me be purified\xc2\x94\nand then perform the Homa ceremony with Samidh, etc., as above-mentioned. Now\nrecollecting that \xc2\x93My principles in my body are purified,\xc2\x94 he is to offer\noblations to the fire. In other words, uttering \xc2\x93Priththitattvas me sudhyatam\njyotiraham viraja vipapma bhuyasam Svaha\xc2\x94 one is to offer oblations to the\nFire. Thus uttering the five element (Mahabhutas), five tanmatras, five\nKarmendriyas (organs of action), five J\xc3\xb1anendriyas (organs of perception),\nfive Pra _n_ as, seven dhatus Tvak, etc., mind, buddhi (intellect), Ahamkara\n(egoism), Sattva, Raja, Tamah gu _n_ as, Prakriti, Puru _s_ a, Raga, Vidya,\nKala (arts etc,) Daiva (Fate), Kala (time), Maya S\xc2\x92uddhavidya, Mahes'vara,\nSada S\xc2\x92iva, S\xc2\x92akti S\xc2\x92ivatattva, etc., respectively by its own name, one is to\noffer oblations to the fire by the five-lettered Viraja Mantra; then the\nsacrificer will become pure. Then form a round ball of fresh cowdung and\npurifying it by Mantram place it on fire and carefully watch it. On that day,\nthe devotee is to take Havi _s_ yanna (a sacred food of boiled rice with\nghee). On the morning of the Chaturdas'i, he is to perform his daily duties as\nabove and then to perform Homa on that fire; uttering the five lettered\nMantra. He is not to take any food the rest of the time. On the next day, that\nis, on the full-moon day, after performing the morning duties, he is to do the\nHoma ceremony, uttering the Five lettered Mantra and then take leave of the\nFire (invoked for worship). He is, then, to raise up the ashes. Then the\ndevotee is to keep Jata (matted hair) or to shave clean his head or to keep\nonly one lock of hair on the crown of the head. He is to take his bath, then;\nand if he can, then he should be naked or put on a red coloured cloth, hide,\nor one piece of rag or bark; he is to take a staff and a belt. Washing his\nhands and feet and sipping twice he by his two hands, is to pulverise the\nashes and, uttering the six Atharvan Mantras, \xc2\x93Fire is ashes\xc2\x94 and so forth,\napply ashes from his head to foot. Then, as before, he is to apply ashes,\ngradually to his arms, etc., and all\n\n\n\np. 1081\n\n\n\nover the body uttering the Pra _n_ ava of S\xc2\x92iva, \xc2\x93Vam, Vam.\xc2\x94 He is to put on\nthe Triyayusa Tripu _nd_ ra on his forehead. After he has done this, the Jiva\n(the embodied self) becomes S\xc2\x92iva (the Free Self) and he should behave himself\nlike S\xc2\x92iva. O Narada! Thus, at the three Sandhya-periods; he is to do like\nthis. This Pas\xc2\x92upata vrata is the source of enjoyment as well as liberation\nand as well as of the cessation of all brutal desires. By the performance of\nthis vrata the devotee is to free himself gradually of his animal feelings and\nthen to worship Bhagavan Sada S\xc2\x92iva in the form of a phallic symbol. The above\nbath ashes is highly meritorious and it is the source of all happiness. By\nholding the ashes, one's longevity is prolonged, one gets even great bodily\nstrength, becomes healthy and his beauty increases and he gets nourishment.\nThis using of ashes is for the preservation of one's own self; it is the\nsource of one's good and of all sorts of happiness and prosperity. Those who\nuse ashes (Bhas'ma) are free from the danger of plague and other epidemic\ndiseases; this bhasma is of three sorts as it leads to the attainment of\npeace, nourishment, or to the fufilment of all desires.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Tenth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the subject Gau _n_ a\nBhasma (secondary ashes) in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk11ch11.htm)\n\n"
