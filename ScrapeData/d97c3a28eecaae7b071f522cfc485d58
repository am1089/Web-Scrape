And for this very reason eternity (of the Veda).\n\nAs words such as Indra and Vasish _th_ a, which denote gods and _Ri_ shis,\ndenote (not individuals only, but) classes, and as the creation of those\nbeings is preceded by their being suggested to the creative mind through those\nwords; for this reason the eternity of the Veda admits of being reconciled\nwith what scripture says about the mantras and ka _nd_ as (sections) of the\nsacred text having 'makers' and about _Ri_ shis seeing the hymns; cp. such\npassages as 'He chooses the makers of mantras'; 'Reverence to the _Ri_ shis\nwho are the makers of mantras'; 'That is Agni; this is a hymn of Vi _s_\nvamitra.' For by means of these very texts Pra _g_ apati presents to his own\nmind the characteristics and powers of the different _Ri_ shis who make the\ndifferent sections, hymns, and mantras, thereupon creates them endowed with\nthose characteristics and powers, and appoints\n\np. 333\n\nthem to remember the very same sections, hymns, &c. The Rishis being thus\ngifted by Pra _g_ apati with the requisite powers, undergo suitable\npreparatory austerities and finally _see_ the mantras, and so on, proclaimed\nby the Vasish _th_ as and other _Ri_ shis of former ages of the world, perfect\nin all their sounds and accents, without having learned them from the\nrecitation of a teacher. There is thus no conflict between the eternity of the\nVeda and the fact that the _Ri_ shis are the _makers_ of its sections, hymns,\nand so on. A further objection is raised. Let it be admitted that after each\npralaya of the kind called 'contingent' (naimittika), Pra _g_ apati may\nproceed to create new Indras, and so on, in the way of remembering on the\nbasis of the Veda the Indras, and so on, of preceding periods. In the case, on\nthe other hand, of a pralaya of the kind called elemental (prak _ri_ tika), in\nwhich the creator, Pra _g_ apati himself, and words--which are the effects of\nthe elemental ahankara--pass away, what possibility is there of Pra _g_ apati\nundertaking a new creation on the basis of Vedic words, and how can we speak\nof the permanency of a Veda which perishes? He who maintains the eternity of\nthe Veda and the corporeality of gods, and so on, is thus really driven to the\nhypothesis of the course of mundane existence being without a beginning (i.e.\nnot preceded by a pralaya).--Of this difficulty the next Sutra disposes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 29.
