Pra _g_ apati desired, 'Might I perform a horse-sacrifice 1?' He\ntoiled and practised fervid devotion. From the body of him, when wearied and\nheated, the deities departed in a sevenfold way: therefrom the Diksha\n(initiation) was produced. He perceived those Vai _s_ vadeva 2 (oblations). He\noffered\n\np. 290\n\nthem, and by means of them he gained the Diksha: and when the Sacrificer\noffers the Vai _s_ vadeva (oblations) it is the Diksha he thereby gains. Day\nafter day he offers them: day after day he thus gains the Diksha 1. Seven of\nthem he offers; for seven were those deities that departed (from Pra _g_\napati); it is by means of them that he (the priest) gains the Diksha for him.\n\n13:1:7:22\\. But, indeed, the vital airs depart from those who exceed (the\nduration of) the Diksha. For\n\np. 291\n\nseven days they observe it; for there are seven (outlets of) vital airs in the\nhead, and the Diksha is the vital airs: it is by means of the vital airs he\ngains the Diksha, the vital airs, for him. He makes offering by dividing\n(each) deity into three parts 1; for the gods are of three orders 2, and of\nthree orders are these worlds: he thus establishes himself in these worlds in\nprosperity and vital power.\n\n13:1:7:33\\. They amount to one and twenty (single invocations and oblations),\n--there are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as\nthe twenty-first,--that is the divine ruling-power, that is the glory: that\nsupreme lordship, that summit of the fallow one (the Sun), that realm of light\nhe attains.\n\n13:1:7:44\\. Thirty Audgrabha _n_ as 3 he offers,--of thirty syllables the Vira\n_g_ (metre) consists, and the Vira _g_ means all food: thus (he offers) for\nthe obtainment of all food. Four Audgrabha _n_ as he offers (on each day), and\nthree Vai _s_ vadevas;--they amount to seven; for there are seven vital airs\nof the head, and the Diksha is the vital airs: by means of the vital airs he\nthus gains the Diksha, the vital airs,\n\np. 292\n\nfor him. A full (-spoon)-oblation 1 he offers last for the sake of\ninvigoration and union.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[289:1](sbe44080.htm#fr_730) Or, 'might I make offering with the life-sap of\nthe horse?' the natural, as well as the technical, meaning of the term 'a _s_\nvamedha' being generally understood in these speculations.\n\n[289:2](sbe44080.htm#fr_731) The oblations offered prior to the initiation--\nhere, as at any Soma-sacrifice--are called Audgrabha _n_ a (elevatory)\noblations. On the present occasion he, in the first place, performs, on each\nof the first six days of the Diksha, the four oblations of this kind offered\nat the ordinary Soma-sacrifice (for which see III, 1, 4, 1 seqq.); whilst on\nthe seventh day he offers, instead of these, the six corresponding oblations\nof the Agni _k_ ayana (which forms a necessary element of the A _s_ vamedha),\nsee VI, 6, 1, 15-20; for a further and final oblation offered on all these\noccasions, see p. 292, note 1. He then performs on each day three additional\noblations p. 290 (increased to four on the last day) which are peculiar to the\nA _s_ vamedha, and vary from day to day in respect of the deities to whom they\nare offered. But whilst, in the _S_ rautasutras, these special oblations are\nlikewise called Audgrabha _n_ a (Katy. XX, 4, 2-10), the author here applies\nto them the term Vai _s_ vadeva, owing apparently to the fact of their being\noffered, not to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ properly speaking, but to different\ndeities. In the dogmatic explanation of the Audgrabha _n_ as of the ordinary\nsacrifice, reference was also made (at III, 1, 4, 9) to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_\n, but only incidentally. Harisvamin, indeed, points out that the designation\nVai _s_ vadeva refers in the first place to the invocations (Va _g_. S. XXII,\n20) used with these special oblations (as is, indeed, evident from [paragraph\n2](sbe44080.htm#13:1:7:2); cf. also part ii, p. 20, note 1); and the total of\nseven applied to them does not therefore refer here (as it does in [paragraph\n4](sbe44080.htm#13:1:7:4)) to the four ordinary and the three special\nAudgrabha _n_ a oblations, but to the series of dedicatory formulas relating\nto the latter oblations, as explained p. 291, note 1; and, of course, by\nimplication, to the oblations themselves.\n\n[290:1](sbe44080.htm#fr_732) Though the Initiation only becomes perfect by the\nSacrificer being girded with a hempen zone, whilst kneeling on a double black-\nantelope skin, and by a staff being handed to him (III, 2, 1, 1-32); on the\npresent occasion, the Sacrificer is on each day, after the performance of the\nAudgrabha _n_ a oblations, at least to sit down on the antelope skin; whilst\non the seventh and last day of the Diksha _n_ iyesh _t_ i, the remaining\nceremonies take place, after which those of the Agni _k_ ayana, viz. the\nplacing of the Ukha, or fire-pan, on the fire and the putting of thirteen\nfire-sticks in the pan (VI, 6, 2, 1 seqq.), &c.\n\n[291:1](sbe44080.htm#fr_733) The ka _n_ _d_ ika XXII, 20 is made up of seven\nparts, each of which consists of three distinct invocations addressed to the\nsame deity; the seven deities addressed in the whole formula being Ka, Pra _g_\napati, Aditi, Sarasvati, Pushan, Tvash _t_ _ri_ , and Vish _n_ u; whilst the\nthree invocations to Ka, for instance, are 'Kaya svaha! Kasmai svaha!\nKatamasmai svaha!' Cf. [XIII, 1, 8, 2](sbe44081.htm#13:1:8:2) seqq.\n\n[291:2](sbe44080.htm#fr_734) Viz. either the Vasus, Rudras, and \xc3\x82dityas (cf.\nIV, 5, 7, 2); or those of the sky, the air, and the earth, headed by Surya,\nVayu, and Agni respectively.\n\n[291:3](sbe44080.htm#fr_735) That is, the four Audgrabha _n_ as of the\nordinary Soma-sacrifice offered on each of the seven days of the Diksha, and\ntwo more added thereto on the seventh day.\n\n[292:1](sbe44080.htm#fr_736) For a full discussion of this final Audgrabha _n_\na oblation, the only one, it would seem, offered with the regular offering-\nspoon ( _g_ uhu) filled by means of the dipping-spoon (sruva), see III, 1, 4,\n2; 16-23; cf. also VI, 6, 1, 21.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 1, 8.
