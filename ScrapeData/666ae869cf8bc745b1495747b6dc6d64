Then Va _k_ aknavi 3 said: 'Venerable Brahma _n_ as, I shall ask him two\nquestions. If he will answer them, none of you, I think, will defeat him in\nany argument concerning Brahman.'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'Ask, O Gargi.'\n\n2\\. She said: 'O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, as the son of a warrior from the Ka _s_\nis or Videhas might string his loosened bow, take two pointed foe-piercing\narrows in his hand and rise to do battle, I have risen to\n\np. 137\n\nfight thee with two questions. Answer me these questions.'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'Ask, O Gargi.'\n\n3\\. She said: 'O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, that of which they say that it is above\nthe heavens, beneath the earth, embracing heaven and earth 1, past, present,\nand future, tell me in what is it woven, like warp and woof?'\n\n4\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'That of which they say that it is above the\nheavens, beneath the earth, embracing heaven and earth, past, present, and\nfuture, that is woven, like warp and woof, in the ether (aka _s_ a).'\n\n5\\. She said: 'I bow to thee, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, who hast solved me that\nquestion. Get thee ready for the second.'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said 2: 'Ask, O Gargi.'\n\n6\\. She said: 'O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, that of which they say that it is above\nthe heavens, beneath the earth, embracing heaven and earth, past, present, and\nfuture, tell me in what is it woven, like warp and woof?'\n\n7\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'That of which they say that it is above the\nheavens, beneath the earth, embracing heaven and earth, past, present, and\nfuture, that is woven, like warp and woof, in the ether.'\n\nGargi said: 'In what then is the ether woven, like warp and woof?'\n\n8\\. He said: 'O Gargi, the Brahma _n_ as call this the Akshara (the\nimperishable). It is neither coarse nor fine, neither short nor long, neither\nred (like fire) nor fluid (like water); it is without shadow, without\ndarkness, without air, without ether, without\n\np. 138\n\nattachment 1, without taste, without smell, without eyes, without ears,\nwithout speech, without mind, without light (vigour), without breath, without\na mouth (or door), without measure, having no within and no without, it\ndevours nothing, and no one devours it.'\n\n9\\. 'By the command of that Akshara (the imperishable), O Gargi, sun and moon\nstand apart 2. By the command of that Akshara, O Gargi, heaven and earth stand\napart. By the command of that Akshara, O Gargi, what are called moments\n(nimesha), hours (muhurta), days and nights, half-months, months, seasons,\nyears, all stand apart. By the command of that Akshara, O Gargi, some rivers\nflow to the East from the white mountains, others to the West, or to any other\nquarter. By the command of that Akshara, O Gargi, men praise those who give,\nthe gods follow the sacrificer, the fathers the Darvi-offering.'\n\n10\\. 'Whosoever, O Gargi, without knowing that Akshara (the imperishable),\noffers oblations in this world, sacrifices, and performs penance for a\nthousand years, his work will have an end. Whosoever, O Gargi, without knowing\nthis Akshara, departs this world, he is miserable (like a slave) 3. But he, O\nGargi, who departs this world, knowing this Akshara, he is a Brahma _n_ a.'\n\n11\\. 'That Brahman,' O Gargi, 'is unseen, but seeing; unheard, but hearing;\nunperceived, but perceiving; unknown, but knowing. There is nothing\n\np. 139\n\nthat sees but it, nothing that hears but it, nothing that perceives but it,\nnothing that knows but it. In that Akshara then, O Gargi, the ether is woven,\nlike warp and woof.'\n\n12\\. Then said Gargi: 'Venerable Brahmans, you may consider it a great thing,\nif you get off by bowing before him. No one, I believe, will defeat him in any\nargument concerning Brahman.' After that Vaka _k_ navi held her peace.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[136:2](sbe15071.htm#fr_414) Madhyandina text, p. 1075.\n\n[136:3](sbe15071.htm#fr_415) Gargi, not the wife of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\n[137:1](sbe15071.htm#fr_416) Deussen, p. 143, translates, 'between heaven and\nearth,' but that would be the antariksha.\n\n[137:2](sbe15071.htm#fr_417) This repetition does not occur in the Madhyandina\ntext.\n\n[138:1](sbe15071.htm#fr_418) Not adhering to anything, like lac or gum.\n\n[138:2](sbe15071.htm#fr_419) Each follows its own course.\n\n[138:3](sbe15071.htm#fr_420) He stores up the effects from work, like a miser\nhis riches,' Roer.
