A creditor shall receive his principal back from his debtor exactly as he\nhad lent it to him.\n\n2\\. (As regards the interest to be paid), he shall take in the direct order of\nthe castes two, three, four, or five in the hundred by the month (if no pledge\nhas been given).\n\n3\\. Or let debtors of any caste pay as much interest as has been promised by\nthemselves.\n\n4\\. After the lapse of one year let them pay interest according to the above\nrule, even though it have not been agreed on.\n\n5\\. By the use of a pledge (to be kept only) interest is forfeited.\n\n[VI. 2. M. VIII, 142; Y. II, 37.--1, 2. Colebrooke, Dig. I, 2, XXXI.--3. M.\nVIII, 157; Y. II, 38.--4. Colebrooke, Dig.

(The pledge must) also (be restored to the debtor) when the interest has\nreached its maximum amount (on becoming equal to the principal, and has all\nbeen paid).\n\n8 But he must not restore an immovable pledge without special agreement (till\nthe principal itself has been paid).\n\n9\\. That immovable property which has been delivered, restorable when the sum\nborrowed is made good, (the creditor) must restore when the sum borrowed has\nbeen made good.\n\n10\\. Property lent bears no further interest after it has been tendered, but\nrefused by the creditor.\n\n11\\. On gold the interest shall rise no higher than to make the debt double;\n\n12\\. On grain, (no higher than to make it) threefold;.\n\n13\\. On cloth, (no higher than to make it) fourfold;\n\n14\\. On liquids, (no higher than to make it) eightfold;\n\n15\\. Of female slaves and cattle, the offspring (shall be taken as interest).\n\n16\\. On substances from which spirituous liquor\n\n[7. Colebrooke loc. cit. connects this Sutra with the next. My rendering rests\non Nand.'s interpretation.\n\n8\\. Nand. cites as an instance of an agreement of this kind one made in the\nfollowing form, 'You shall have the enjoyment of this or that mango grove as\nlong as interest on the principal lent to me has not ceased to accrue.']\n\np. 44\n\nis extracted, on cotton, thread, leather, weapons, bricks, and charcoal, the\ninterest is unlimited.\n\n17\\. On such objects as have not been mentioned it may be double.\n\n18\\. A creditor recovering the sum lent by any (lawful) means shall not be\nreproved by the king.\n\n19\\. If the debtor, so forced to discharge the debt, complains to the king, he\nshall be fined in an equal sum.\n\n20\\. If a creditor sues before the king and fully proves his demand, the\ndebtor shall pay as a fine to the king a tenth part of the sum proved;\n\n21\\. And the creditor, having received the sum due, shall pay a twentieth part\nof it.\n\n22\\. If the whole demand has been contested by the debtor, and even a part of\nit only has been proved against him, he must pay the whole.\n\n23\\. There are three means of proof in case of a demand having been contested,\nviz. a writing, witnesses, and proof by ordeal.\n\n24\\. A debt contracted before witnesses should be discharged in the presence\nof witnesses.\n\n25\\. A written contract having been fulfilled, the writing should be torn.\n\n26\\. Part only being paid, and the writing not being at hand, let the creditor\ngive an acquittance.\n\n27\\. If he who contracted the debt should die, or\n\n[17. Nand. infers from a passage of Katyayana that this rule refers to gems,\npearls, coral, gold, silver, cotton, silk, and wool.\n\n18\\. The 'lawful means' are mediation of friends, and the four other modes of\ncompelling payment of an unliquidated demand (Nand.) See M. VIII, 49.\n\n22\\. 'The particle api indicates that he must pay a fine to the king besides,\nas ordained by Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya.'

But not by remoter descendants against their will.\n\n29\\. He who takes the assets of a man, leaving or not leaving male issue, must\npay the sum due (by him);\n\n30\\. And (so must) he who has the care of the widow left by one who had no\nassets.\n\n31\\. A woman (shall) not (be compelled to pay) the debt of her husband or son;\n\n32\\. Nor the husband or son (to pay) the debt of a woman (who is his wife or\nmother);\n\n33.. Nor a father to pay the debt of his son.\n\n34\\. A debt contracted by parceners shall be paid by any one of them who is\npresent.\n\n35\\. And so shall the debt of the father (be paid) by (any one of) the\nbrothers (or of their sons) before partition.\n\n36\\. But after partition they shall severally pay according to their shares of\nthe inheritance.\n\n37\\. A debt contracted by the wife of a herdsman, distiller of spirits, public\ndancer, washer, or hunter shall be discharged by the husband (because he is\nsupported by his wife).\n\n38\\. (A debt of which payment has been previously) promised must be paid by\nthe householder;\n\n39\\. And (so must he pay that debt) which was\n\n[38, 39. Regarding these two Sutras see Jolly, Indisches Schuldrecht, in the\nTransactions of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences, 1877, p. 309, note.]\n\np. 46\n\ncontracted by any person for the behoof of the family.\n\n40\\. He who on receiving the whole amount of a loan, promises to repay the\nprincipal on the following day (or some other date near at hand), but from\ncovetousness does not repay it, shall give interest for it.\n\n41\\. Suretiship is ordained for appearance, for honesty, and for payment; the\nfirst two (sureties, and not their sons), must pay the debt on failure of\ntheir engagements, but even the sons of the last (may be compelled to pay it).\n\n42\\. When there are several sureties (jointly bound), they shall pay their\nproportionate shares of the debt, but when they are bound severally, the\npayment shall be made (by any of them), as the creditor pleases.\n\n43\\. If the surety, being harassed by the creditor, discharges the debt, the\ndebtor shall pay twice as much to the surety.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII.](sbe07009.htm)\n\n"
