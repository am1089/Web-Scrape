Now, once upon a time, a tiger killed the samra _g_ -cow 1 of\nthose (who were sacrificing) with (the king of the) Ke _s_ in as their G _ri_\nhapati 2. He (the king 3) said to his fellow-sacrificers, \'What atonement is\nthere for this?\' They replied, \'There is no atonement for this: Kha _n_ _d_\nika Audbhari alone knows an atonement for it; but he certainly desires as much\nas this, and worse than this 4, (to happen) to thee.\'\n\n11:8:4:22\\. He said, \'Charioteer, put to my horses; I shall drive thither: if\nso be he will tell me, I shall succeed (with my sacrifice); but if he will\nhave me die, I shall be shattered along with the shattered sacrifice.\'\n\n11:8:4:33\\. Having put to the horses, he drove off, and\n\np. 132\n\ncame thither 1. When he (Kha _n_ _d_ ika) saw 2 him, he said, \'Seeing that\nthere are those skins on deer, we break their ribs and cook them: the skin of\nthe black antelope is attached to my neck 3\\--is it with thoughts such as\nthese that thou hast dared to drive over to me?\'\n\n11:8:4:44\\. \'Not so,\' he replied; \'a tiger has killed my samra _g_ -cow,\nreverend sir; if so be thou wilt tell me, I shall succeed; but if thou wilt\nhave me die, I shall be shattered along with the shattered sacrifice.\'\n\n11:8:4:55\\. He said, \'I will take counsel with my counsellors 4.\' Having\ncalled them to counsel, he said, \'If I tell him, his race, not mine, will\nprevail here 5,\n\np. 133\n\nbut I shall gain the (other) world; and if I do not tell him, my own race, not\nhis, will prevail here, but he will gain the (other) world.\' They said, \'Do\nnot tell him, reverend sir, for, surely, this (the earth) is the Kshatriya\'s\nworld 1.\' He replied, \'Nay, I will tell him: there are more nights 2 up\nyonder.\'\n\n11:8:4:66\\. And, accordingly, he then said to him,--\'Having offered the Sp\n_ri_ tis 3, he (the Adhvaryu) should say, "Drive up another (cow)!" and that\none should be thy samra _g_ -cow 4.\'--\'[Having offered. with,] "From the moon\nI take thy mind, hail!--From the sun I take thine eye, hail!--From the wind I\ntake thy breathings, hail!--From the regions I take thine ear, hail!--From the\nwaters I take thy blood, hail!--From the earth\n\np. 134\n\n[paragraph continues] I take thy body, hail!" let him then say, "Drive up\nanother (cow)!" and that one shall be thy samrag cow!\' He then departed from\nthence 1, and, verily, members of the Ke _s_ in race are born here even to\nthis day.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[131:1](sbe44044.htm#fr_401) That is the cow which supplies the milk for the\nPravargya; this milk, when heated, being called \'gharma (heat)\' or \'samra _g_\n(sovereign king).\' See part ii, p. 104, note 3.\n\n[131:2](sbe44044.htm#fr_402) G _ri_ hapati, or house-lord, master of the\nhouse, is the title of the principal sacrificer at a sacrificial session\n(sattra).--According to Saya _n_ a, the Ke _s_ ina _h_ were a race of nobles\n(ra _g_ ana _h_ ), who, on this occasion, were performing a \'sattra,\' and are\ntherefore styled \'householders\' (g _ri_ hapati);--ke _s_ ino nama ra _g_ ana\n_h_ sattrayagam anutish _th_ anto g _ri_ hapataya asu _h_ , Saya _n_ a thus\ntakes \'ke _s_ i-g _ri_ hapataya _h_ ,\' not as a bahuvrihi, but as a tatpurusha\n(karmadharaya, \'the Ke _s_ in householders\') which would, however, require the\naccent on the second member of the compound.--Though all those taking part in\na sacrificial session ought to be Brahmans, the rule does not seem to have\nbeen strictly observed. Cf. part iv, introd., p. xxv; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, pp.\n25 94.\n\n[131:3](sbe44044.htm#fr_403) G _ri_ hapatishu pradhanabhuta _h_ ke _s_ ira _g_\na _h_ , Say.\n\n[131:4](sbe44044.htm#fr_404) That is, that even a greater misfortune should\nhappen to thee,--atyanta _m_ papayukta _m_ govadhadidoshayuktam ity artha _h_\n, Say.\n\n[132:1](sbe44044.htm#fr_405) Saya _n_ a makes Kha _n_ _d_ ika the subject of\nthis last verb:--sa ha ratham a _s_ vai _h_ sa _m_ yo _g_ ya Kha _n_ _d_\nikasamipa _m_ yayau; so\xe0\xa4\xbdpi Kha _n_ _d_ ika _h_ ke _s_ inam a _g_ agama, gatva\n_k_ a vivakta _m_ (? vivikta _m_ ) Ke _s_ ina _m_ pratikhyaya nirak _ri_ tya\nsadayam eva prathamam uva _k_ a. He thus seems not to allow here to \'ya\' the\nmeaning of \'to drive,\' but to take \'yayau\' in the sense of \'he went thither.\'\nIt might, of course, also mean \'he set off.\'\n\n[132:2](sbe44044.htm#fr_406) Saya _n_ a apparently takes \'prati-khya\' in the\nsense of \'to refuse admittance to, to reject,\' \'abweisen.\'\n\n[132:3](sbe44044.htm#fr_407) Saya _n_ a\'s comment on this passage is as\nfollows:--\'O Ke _s_ in, the skin of the cow that yields the gharma-milk is\nworn by thee on the neck: those (i.e. suchlike) skins, indeed, are (i.e. are\nseen) on deer; and having broken (i.e., torn to pieces) the "p _ri_ sh _t_ i"\n(i.e. the small-sized does) amongst them we cook them: that black-antelope\nskin is fastened on my neck.\' Kha _n_ _d_ ika having spoken thus, the king\nsaid, \'No, this is not my intention.\'\n\n[132:4](sbe44044.htm#fr_408) Literally, those that should be consulted, whom\nfurther on Saya _n_ a calls \'apta _h_ \' or trusty men.\n\n[132:5](sbe44044.htm#fr_409) Or, perhaps, the people here (the Ke _s_ ins)\nwill become his, not mine; cf. Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, pp. 32; 141 (two\ndifferent renderings). Saya _n_ a, on the other hand, takes \'pra _g_ a,\' not\nin the sense either of \'family\' or \'people,\' but in that of \'(sacred)\nknowledge\'--perhaps with reference to the threefold science (the Veda) as the\np. 133 thousandfold progeny of Va _k_ , speech (cf. IV, 5, 8, 4; 6, 7, 3; V,\n5, 5, 12)--which Kha _n_ _d_ ika would thus lose, whilst, by imparting the\nsacred knowledge, he would gain a seat in heaven.\n\n[133:1](sbe44044.htm#fr_410) Saya _n_ a\'s comment is not very intelligible,\nthe MS. being more than usually corrupt on this last page:--eva _m_ vidhe\nvirodha udbhavite sati to apta u _k_ u _h_ , he bhagavo vidya _m_ ma vo _k_ a\n_h_ , kshatriyasya loko na bhavishyatiti; nanu tavanu _s_ aya _h_ (? appanage,\ndomain, following) sa tasya nasti; aya _m_ vava ayam eva khalu, kshatriyasya\nlokas tasmat sauspatrater (?) evam ukte sati sadve _k_ enarapatra bhavanti (!)\nato vakshyamy evety uva _k_ a.\n\n[133:2](sbe44044.htm#fr_411) That is, days,--by giving up a brief life of\nearthly power and glory, he gains eternal life.\n\n[133:3](sbe44044.htm#fr_412) That is, oblations performed with a view of\n\'taking hold (sp _ri_ )\' of something; cf. Katy. _S_ rautas. XXV, 6, 11. 12.\n\n[133:4](sbe44044.htm#fr_413) The particle \'iti\' here causes some difficulty of\nconstruction which would be removed by the latter clause being taken as part\nof the Adhvaryu\'s speech; though Katyayana, it is true, does not recognise it\nas such. Perhaps, however, Kha _n_ _d_ ika\'s speech ends here, and what\nfollows up to \'that one shall be thy samra _g_ -cow\' has to be taken as a\nritualistic insertion, in which case the final \'iti\' would have some such\nmeaning as \'having been told thus.\'\n\n[134:1](sbe44044.htm#fr_414) Saya _n_ a takes this thus:--\'Thus instructed, Ke\n_s_ in disappeared (or, passed away, vanished, utsasada vinash _t_ a _h_ )\nfrom that region (tato de _s_ at)\'--after which there is a lacuna in the MS.\nPerhaps, however, it is Kha _n_ _d_ ika, rather than Ke _s_ in, to which this\nrefers,--he (and his race) then, indeed, passed away from that region, whilst\nthe Ke _s_ ins flourished.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 1, 1.
