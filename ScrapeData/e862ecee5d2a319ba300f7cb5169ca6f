Brahma said :--O Narada! I have described to you what you asked me just\nnow about the creation of this universe, etc. Now hear with attention the\ncolour of the three qualities, as well their configuration and how they are\nseen to exist.\n\n\n\n2-3. The Sattva Gu _n_ a is the source of pleasure and happiness; and when\nhappiness comes, everything seems delightening. When integrity, truthfulness,\ncleanliness, faith, forgiveness, fortitude, mercy, bashfulness, peace and\ncontentment arise in one's heart, know certainly that there has arisen firmly\nthe Sattva Gu _n_ a in that man.\n\n\n\n4\\. The colour of the Sattva quality is white; it makes one always like\nreligion, and have faith towards good purposes and discard one's tendencies\ntowards bad objects.\n\n\n\n5\\. The Ri _s_ is, the seers of truth classify Sraddha (faith) under the three\nheadings: Sattvik, Rajasik and Tamasik.\n\n\n\n6\\. The quality Rajas is of red colour, wonderful and is not pleasant; it is\nthe source of all troubles; there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n7-8. The intelligent should understand that Rajas has certainly arisen in him,\nwhen his mind is filled with hatred, enmity, quarrelsome feeling, pride,\nstupification, uneasiness, sleeplessness, want of faith, egoism, vanity and\narrogance.\n\n\n\n9-11. The quality Tamas is of black colour. From Tamas arises laziness,\nignorance, sleep, poverty, fear, quarrels, miserliness, insincerity, anger,\naberration of intellect, violent atheism, and finding fault with others. The\nwise should think that Tamas has overpowered him when the above\n\n\n\np. 147\n\n\n\nqualities are found to possess him. When this Tamas quality is attended with\nthe Tamasi faith, then it becomes the source of pain to others.\n\n\n\n12\\. The well wishers should manifest in themselves the Sattva qualities,\ncontrol the Rajasic qualities, and destroy the Tamasic qualities.\n\n\n\n13\\. These three qualities are always found to remain intermingled with\nanother, and each of them has always an inherent tendency to overcome the\nothers; and therefore they are always, as it were, at war with another. They\nnever have a separate existence from one another.\n\n\n\n14\\. Never is found anywhere only one Sattva quality to the exclusion of\nothers, the Rajas and Tamas; similar is the case with the Rajas or Tamas. They\nremain intermingled and depend on one another.\n\n\n\n15\\. O Narada! Now hear, in detail, which two qualities remain in twins,\nknowing which, one is freed from this ocean of the transmigration of\nexistence.\n\n\n\n16\\. I have realised these; therefore you ought not to have any uncertainties\non these points. The reality of these is especially felt, when it is really\nunderstood and when its effects begin to manifest themselves.\n\n\n\n17\\. O high-minded! No one is able to realise these at once; it requires be\nheard, and then meditated upon. It also depends on one's natural capability\nand merits, due to the past actions.\n\n\n\n18-21. Suppose one hears of the sacred places of pilgrimages and is filled\nwith the Rajasic devotion. He goes out to those places and sees what he had\nheard before. There he performs his ablutions, makes offerings and the Rajasic\ngifts, stays there for some time; but all this he does under the influence of\nthe Rajasic quality. And when he returns home, he finds himself not free from\nlust, anger, love and hatred; he remains the same that he was before.\nTherefore, in this case, O Narada! man hears but he does not realise the\npurifying effects of those holy places. O best of Munis! And when he does not\nfind any benefit from the holy place of pilgrimage, it is equivalent to his\nnot at all hearing of the place.\n\n\n\n22\\. O best of Munis! The effect of visiting the sacred places of pilgrimages\nis then said to accrue to any individual, when he becomes freed from his sins,\njust as the fruit of cultivating fields is then said to occur, when the\ncultivator gets the ripened harvest out of his labour and enjoys the produce\nof his fields.\n\n\n\n23\\. O Narada! Lust, anger, covetousness, delusion, thirst, hatred, love,\nvanity, malice, jealousy, non-forgiveness, unrest all these indicate that\nthere is sin; and until these are purged out of one's body and mind,\n\n\n\np. 148\n\n\n\nman lives in sin. If the visiting of the sacred places of pilgrimages does not\nenable one to overcome the above passions, then the labours in going to those\nplaces are in vain, i.e., those labours merely are the results just as the\ntoil only undergone by the cultivator is his only result, and is not met with\nany reward when there is no harvest at all.\n\n\n\n24-28. Lo! The cultivator takes hard labour to clear his fields and cultivate\nthe hard soil; he then sows the valuable seeds, because this is considered as\ndoing good. Next, in expectation of the harvest, he undergoes a good deal of\npains, day and night, to protect his fields and goes down to sleep, in the\ncold season, in the forest surrounded by tigers and other dangerous animals;\nbut alas! locusts coming eat away and destroy all the crops, to the utter\ndisappointment of the cultivator. All his labours are spent in vain. So, O\nNarada! The labour taken by one in going to the holy places yields pains, and\npains only, instead of success and happiness.\n\n\n\n29-32. When the Sattva quality grows in abundance, as a consequence of reading\nthe Vedanta and the other S'astras, dispassion comes towards the Rajasic and\nthe Tamasic qualities and things, and the Sattva quality overpowers the Rajas\nand Tamas. Similarly when the Rajasic quality grows in abundance, as a natural\nconsequence of greed and avarice, then it overpowers Sattva and Tamas; so, by\ndelusion, when the Tamasic quality grows in abundance, it overpowers the\nSattva and the Rajasic qualities. O Narada! I will now speak to you, in\ndetail, about the overpowering of these qualities by one another.\n\n\n\n33-35. When the Sattva quality grows in preponderance, the mind rests in\nreligious ideas and things; it no more thinks of those external things, the\nproducts of the Rajas and Tamas qualities. Rather it wants to enjoy the\nSattvic things; wealth, religious affairs, sacrifices that can be acquired or\nperformed without any trouble. Then that individual yearns after salvation and\nrenounces his pursuits after the Rajasic and Tamasic objects.\n\n\n\n36\\. Thus, O Narada! first try to conquer the Rajas and then the Tamas; then\nthe Sattva becomes pure.\n\n\n\n37\\. When the Rajasic quality grows in preponderance, the individual imbibes\nthe Rajasic faith, abandons his own Sanatan Dharma (settled eternal religion)\nand practises against his religious instructions.\n\n\n\n38\\. Under the Rajasic propensities, one is eager to amass wealth and enjoy\nthe Rajasic things. The Rajas drives away the Sattva and curbs the Tamas.\n\n\n\n39-41. Narada! So when the Tamasic quality grows in preponderance,\n\n\n\np. 149\n\n\n\nthe faith in the Vedas and in the religious S'astras entirely disappears.\nImbibing the Tamasic faith, the individual squanders away his wealth and is\nalways engaged in quarrels, and party feelings, envy, violence and never\nenjoys peace. The individual with the Tamasic quality in excess overpowers the\nRajasic and Sattvic qualities and becomes angry, wicked, and a great cheat and\ndoes everything as he likes, without any regard to his superiors.\n\n\n\n42\\. Narada! Thus you see that, of these three qualities, no one can remain\nentirely alone, free from the other qualities. These remain always in twos or\nthrees.\n\n\n\n43-44. The Sattva can never exist without the Rajas; the Rajas can never exist\nwithout the Tamas; and these two qualities can never exist without Tamas.\nAgain Tamas cannot exist without Rajas and Sattva. These qualities act and\nreact always in twos or threes.\n\n\n\n45-47. They never exist separately; they live in pairs or threes and are the\noriginators of each other; these qualities are of the nature of procreating\nthings; in other words, Sattva originates the Rajas or Tamas; again the Rajas\noriginates sometimes Sattva and Tamas. Again the Tamas sometimes originates\nSattva and Rajas. Thus they generate each other as the earthen pots and earth\nare their mutual causes.\n\n\n\n48-49. Deva Datta, Vi _sn_ u Mitra, and Yaj\xc3\xb1a Datta these three united perform\nany action, so these three qualities united reside in the buddhi (intellect)\nof the Jivas and generate their sense perceptions.\n\n\n\nJust as the husband and wife get into a couple, the qualities get into\ncouples.\n\n\n\n50\\. The Sattva with Rajas forms the couple Rajas Sattva; so Sattva Rajas\nforms another couple, where the Sattva predominates. So Sattva end Rajas forms\neach with Tamas the other couples.\n\n\n\n51\\. Narada said! O Dvaipayana! Hearing thus about these three qualities from\nmy father, I asked him again these questions.\n\n\n\nThus ends the eighth chapter of the Maha Pura _n_ am S'rimad Devi Bhagavatam\ncontaining the description of the Gu _n_ as, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk03ch09.htm)\n\n"
