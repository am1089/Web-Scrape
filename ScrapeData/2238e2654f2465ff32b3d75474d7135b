Having brought water forward 1, he takes out (the material for) a\ncake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vish _n_ u; for Agni is all the deities,\nsince it is in Agni that offering is made to all the deities. Moreover Agni is\nthe lower half, and Vish _n_ u is the upper half of the sacrifice: 'I will\nbecome consecrated after encompassing all the deities, after encompassing the\nentire sacrifice,' thus he thinks, and hence there is a cake on eleven\npotsherds for Agni and Vish _n_ u.\n\n3:1:3:22\\. Some then offer a rice-pap to the \xc3\x82dityas. This is referred to (in\nthe passage, Rig-veda X, 72, 8), 'There are eight sons of Aditi who were born\nfrom her body; with seven she went to the gods, but Marta _n_ _d_ a 2 she cast\noff.'\n\n3:1:3:33\\. Now Aditi had eight sons. But those that are called 'the gods, sons\nof Aditi,' were only seven, for the eighth, Marta _n_ _d_ a, she brought forth\nunformed 3: it was a mere lump of bodily matter 4, as broad as it was high.\nSome, however, say that he was of the size of a man.\n\n3:1:3:44\\. The gods, sons of Aditi, then spake, 'That\n\np. 13\n\nwhich was born after us 1 must not be lost: come, let us fashion it.' They\naccordingly fashioned it as this man is fashioned. The flesh which was cut off\nhim, and thrown down in a lump, became the elephant: hence they say that one\nmust not accept an elephant (as a gift) 2, since the elephant has sprung from\nman. Now he whom they thus fashioned was Vivasvat, the \xc3\x82ditya (or the sun);\nand of him (came) these creatures.\n\n3:1:3:55\\. He spake, 'Among my offspring he shall be successful who shall\noffer that rice-pap to the \xc3\x82dityas.' Accordingly he alone succeeds who offers\nthat rice-pap to the \xc3\x82dityas. Only that (cake) to Agni and Vish _n_ u is,\nhowever, generally approved.\n\n3:1:3:66\\. There are seventeen kindling-verses for it 3. In a low voice he\noffers to the two deities. There are five fore-offerings and three after-\nofferings. For the sake of completeness they perform the patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as\n4; but he offers no samish _t_ aya _g_ us, lest, having put on that garment of\nthe consecrated, he should reach the end of the sacrifice before its\ncompletion; for the samish _t_ aya _g_ us is the end of the sacrifice.\n\n3:1:3:77\\. He (the sacrificer) then gets himself anointed (with fresh butter),\nwhile standing east of the hall. For, having been flayed, man is sore; and by\ngetting himself anointed, he becomes healed of his soreness: for man's skin is\non the cow, and that fresh butter\n\np. 14\n\nalso comes from the cow. He (the Adhvaryu) thus supplies him with his own\nskin, and for this reason he gets himself anointed.\n\n3:1:3:88\\. It is fresh butter,--for melted butter (ghee) belongs to the gods,\nand creamy butter 1 to men. Here, on the other hand, it is neither ghee nor\ncreamy butter; it should rather be both ghee and creamy butter, for the sake\nof unimpaired vigour: by means of that which is of unimpaired vigour he\naccordingly makes him of unimpaired vigour.\n\n3:1:3:99\\. He anoints him from the head down to the feet in accordance with\nthe tendency of the hair, with the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 3), 'Thou art the sap\nof the great ones.' The 'great ones,' doubtless, is one of the names of those\ncows, and their sap indeed it is: therefore he says, 'thou art the sap of the\ngreat ones.' 'Thou art life-giving: give me light!' There is nothing obscure\nin this.\n\n3:1:3:1010\\. Thereupon he anoints the eyes. 'Sore, indeed, is the eye of man;\nmine is sound,' so spake Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya. Dim-eyed, indeed, he was\n(heretofore); and the secretion of his eyes was matter. He now makes his eyes\nsound by anointing them.\n\n3:1:3:1111\\. Now, when the gods slew the Asura-Rakshas, _S_ ush _n_ a 2, the\nDanava, falling backward entered into the eyes of men: he is that pupil of the\neye, and\n\np. 15\n\nlooks like a young lad 1. Against him he (the sacrificer), now that he enters\non the sacrifice, raises a rampart of stone all round himself, for the\nointment is (produced from) stone.\n\n3:1:3:1212\\. It is such as comes from mount Trikakud; for when Indra slew V\n_ri_ tra he transformed that eye of his (V _ri_ tra's) into the mount Trikakud\n2. The reason, then, why (ointment) from mount Trikakud (is used), is that he\nthereby puts eye into eye. Should he be unable to obtain any Traikakuda\nointment, any other than Traikakuda may be used; for one and the same, indeed,\nis the significance of the ointment.\n\n3:1:3:1313\\. He anoints (the eyes) with a reed-stalk, for the reed is a\nthunderbolt. It is one with a tuft, in order to chase away the evil spirits 3.\nFor rootless,\n\np. 16\n\nindeed, and unfettered on both sides, the Rakshas roams along the air; even as\nman here roams along the air 1, rootless and unfettered on both sides: the\nreason, then, why it is (a reed-stalk) with a tuft, is to chase away the evil\nspirits.\n\n3:1:3:1414\\. The right eye he anoints first; for in human practice the left\n(eye is anointed) first, but with the gods (it is done) thus.\n\n3:1:3:1515\\. He anoints it with the text, 'Thou art the eye-ball of V _ri_\ntra,'--for V _ri_ tra's eye-ball it indeed is;--'Eye-giving thou art: give me\nthe eye!' in this there is nothing obscure.\n\n3:1:3:1616\\. The right eye he anoints once with the sacrificial formula, once\nsilently; and the left one he anoints once with the formula, twice silently:\nthus he makes the left (or upper) one superior 2.\n\n3:1:3:1717\\. And the reason why he anoints five times, is that the sacrifice\nis of equal measure with the year, and five seasons there are in the year: he\nthus obtains possession of the latter in five (divisions), and therefore he\nanoints five times.\n\n3:1:3:1818\\. He then purifies him with a cleanser (pavitra, strainer) of\nsacred grass; for impure, indeed, is man:--he is foul within in that he speaks\nuntruth;--and sacred grass is pure: 'Having become pure, I shall be\nconsecrated,' thus he thinks;--and the stalks of sacred grass are a means of\ncleansing,--\n\np. 17\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Having become cleansed, I shall be consecrated,' thus\nhe thinks; and therefore he purifies him with a cleanser of sacred grass.\n\n3:1:3:1919\\. It may consist of one (stalk of grass); for that blower (or\npurifier, the Wind) is one only, and in accordance with his nature is this\n(cleanser): hence it may consist of one (stalk).\n\n3:1:3:2020\\. Or there may be three (stalks); for one, indeed, is that blower,\nbut on entering into man he becomes threefold, to wit, the out-breathing, the\nin-breathing, and the through-breathing 1, and in accordance with his measure\nis this (cleanser): hence there may be three (stalks).\n\n3:1:3:2121\\. Or there may be seven (stalks 2); for there are seven vital airs\nof the head: hence there may be seven (stalks). There may even be thrice\nseven,--one and twenty: such indeed is perfection.\n\n3:1:3:2222\\. He purifies him with seven (stalks) each time, with the text (Va\n_g_. S. IV, 4), 'May the Lord of thought purify me!' The lord of thought\ndoubtless is Pra _g_ apati 3: he thereby means to say, 'May Pra _g_ apati\npurify me!' 'May the lord of speech purify me!' The lord of speech doubtless\nis Pra _g_ apati 4: he thereby means to say, 'May Pra _g_ apati purify me!'\n'May the divine Savit _ri_ purify me,'--for well purified indeed is he whom\nthe divine\n\np. 18\n\n[paragraph continues] Savit _ri_ has purified 1; therefore he says, 'May the\ndivine Savit _ri_ purify me!'--'with a flawless cleanser;' for that blower\n(the wind) is indeed a flawless cleanser: 'with that one,' he means to say;\n'with the rays of the sun;' for they, the rays of the sun, are indeed\npurifiers; therefore he says, 'with the rays of the sun.'\n\n3:1:3:2323\\. 'O Lord of the pavitra' (means of purification),--for he (who is\nconsecrated) is indeed the lord of the pavitra,--'of thee, purified by the\npavitra,--for he is indeed purified by the pavitra';--'with whatsoever desire\nI purify myself, may I be able to effect it!' whereby he says, 'May I reach\nthe end of the sacrifice!'\n\n3:1:3:2424\\. He then makes him pronounce the beginning of the benedictions (Va\n_g_. S. IV, 5), 'We approach you, O gods, for desirable goods, at the opening\nof the sacrifice; we call on you, O gods, for holy 2 blessings.' Thereby the\nofficiating priests invoke on him those blessings which are their own.\n\n3:1:3:2525\\. He (the sacrificer) then bends his fingers inwards, viz. the two\n(little fingers), with the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 6), 'Hail, from the mind (I\ntake hold of) the sacrifice!'--the two (nameless or ring fingers) with, 'Hail,\nfrom the wide ether!'--the two (middle fingers) with, 'Hail, from the sky and\nearth!'--with, 'Hail, from the wind, I take hold (of the sacrifice)!' he\nclenches both fists 3. Not visibly\n\np. 19\n\nindeed is the sacrifice to be taken hold of, as is either this staff or the\ngarment,--but invisible indeed are the gods, invisible is the sacrifice.\n\n3:1:3:2626\\. Now when he says, 'Hail, from the mind (I take hold of) the\nsacrifice,' he takes hold of it from the mind;--in saying, 'From the wide\nether,' he takes hold of it from the ether;--in saying, 'From heaven and\nearth,' he takes hold of it from those two, heaven and earth, on which this\nentire universe rests;--and in saying, 'From the wind I take hold of (the\nsacrifice)'--the wind being the sacrifice--he takes hold of the sacrifice\ndirectly.\n\n3:1:3:2727\\. And when he calls, 'Hail! Hail 1!'--the 'Svaha' being the\nsacrifice--he thereby appropriates the sacrifice. Here now he restrains his\nspeech; the sacrifice being speech: he thereby appropriates 2 the sacrifice.\n\n3:1:3:2828\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then makes him enter the hall. He walks along\nthe back of the \xc3\x82havaniya and the front of the Garhapatya 3,--this is his\npassage until the Soma pressing. The reason why this is his passage until the\nSoma pressing is this. The fire is the womb of the sacrifice, and the\nconsecrated is an embryo; and the embryo moves about\n\np. 20\n\nwithin the womb. And since he (the sacrificer) moves about there (between the\nfires), and now turns round and now back, therefore these embryos move about,\nand now turn round and now back. Hence this is his passage till the Soma\npressing.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[12:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_43) Viz. the so-called 'pra _n_ ita _h_ ,' see part i,\np. 9 note. The offering, described in the following paragraphs, is called the\nDiksha _n_ i-yesh _t_ i, 'Consecration offering.' As to the formulas used at\nthe offering, see Ait. Br. I, 4 seq.\n\n[12:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_44) The bird, Vish _n_ u, the sun.\n\n[12:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_45) Or, the eighth she brought forth undeveloped, as a\nmarta _n_ _d_ a (? either a bird, or, more probably, in accordance with Taitt.\nS. VI, 5, 6, 1, = vy _ri_ ddham a _n_ _d_ am, 'an abortive egg'). See Rig-veda\nSanhita, translated by M. M., p. 239.\n\n[12:4](sbe2605.htm#fr_46) Sandegha; the St. Petersburg Dict. takes it in the\nsense of 'doubt, uncertainty,' in this passage.\n\n[13:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_47) Or, perhaps, after the manner of us (anu).\n\n[13:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_48) Muir, O. S. T. IV, 15, reads 'parig _ri_ h _n_ iyat'\ninstead of 'pratig _ri_ h _n_ iyat,' and translates, 'let no one catch an\nelephant, for an elephant partakes of the nature of man.'\n\n[13:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_49) For the ordinary eleven Samidhenis (raised to the\nnumber of fifteen by repetitions of the first and last verses), see part i, p.\n102, and for the two additional ones (dhayya), ib. p. 112 note.\n\n[13:4](sbe2605.htm#fr_50) See part i, p. 256; for the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us,\nib. p. 262.\n\n[14:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_51) Pha _n_ _t_ a, explained as the first particles of\nbutter that appear in churning (?). The Ka _n_ va recension, on the other\nhand, reads 'a _g_ ya _m_ nishpa _n_ _t_ am' (!) instead. Cf. Taitt. S. VI, 1,\n1, 4, Gh _ri_ ta _m_ devanam, mastu pit _ri_ _n_ a _m_ , nishpakvam (i.e.\nsurabhi gh _ri_ tam, 'well-seasoned butter,' Say.) manushya _n_ am; tad vai\netat sarvadevatya _m_ yan navanitam; also Ait. Br. I, 3, a _g_ ya _m_ vai\ndevana _m_ , surabhi gh _ri_ tam manushya _n_ am, ayutam pit _ri_ _n_ a _m_ ,\nnavanita _m_ garbha _n_ am; with Haug's note, Transl. p. 8.\n\n[14:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_52) The Ka _n_ va text (MSS. O. W.) reads _S_ i _s_ na.\n\n[15:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_53) Sa esha kaninaka _h_ kumaraka iva paribhasate. A\nplay on the word kaninaka, which has the double meaning of 'youth' and 'pupil\nof the eye.' The St. Petersburg Dict. assigns also to kumaraka the meaning of\n'ball of the eye' in this (the only) passage. The Ka _n_ va recension reads,\nSa esha kumaraka iva kaninakayam (? both 'maiden' and 'pupil of the eye').\n\n[15:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_54) 'Indra slew V _ri_ tra, his eye-ball fell away, it\nbecame collyrium.' Taitt. S. VI, 1, 1, 5.\n\n[15:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_55) Professor Delbruck, S. F. III, 27, takes it thus,\n'He brushes the eye with the end of a reed, for the reed is a thunderbolt\ncapable of repelling mischief.' But, if 'virakshastayai' belonged to what\nprecedes, it would probably have to be construed with ' _s_ areshikaya\n'nakti,' the clause with 'vai,' giving the reason, being inserted\nparenthetically; while, in an idiomatic rendering, it would have to be placed\nat the end: He anoints the eyes with a reed-stalk in order to chase away the\nevil spirits, the reed being a thunderbolt. This abstract dative of purpose is\nvery common; it being generally construed with what precedes, as, for\ninstance, I, 1, 4, 1; 3, 2, 8; 5, 3, 8; 15; [III, 1, 2,\n13](sbe2604.htm#3:1:2:13); [19](sbe2604.htm#3:1:2:19); ; and, with a\nparenthetic clause with 'vai' intervening, [III, 2, 1,\n13](sbe2607.htm#3:2:1:13); [IV, 5, 7, 7](sbe2666.htm#4:5:7:7). Not less common\nis the analogous construction with a clause with 'ned' p. 16 ('lest such an\nevent should happen') instead of the dative of the abstract, cf. I, 2, 1, 8;\n9; [IV, 5, 9, 3](sbe2668.htm#4:5:9:3).\n\n[16:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_56) I now take this passage differently from my\ninterpretation of I, 1, 2, 4 ('and, in order that this man may move about the\nair, rootless and unfettered in both directions'). See also [IV, 1, 1,\n20](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:20).\n\n[16:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_57) 'Tad uttaram evaitad uttaravat karoti;' 'uttara\xcc\x81m\nevaitad uttaram karoti,' Ka _n_ va recension. Cf. [p. 2](sbe2603.htm#page_2),\nnote [1](sbe2603.htm#fn_24).\n\n[17:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_58) See part i, p. 19, note 2.\n\n[17:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_59) The Taitt. S. VI, 1, 1 allows the option between\n(one), 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 21 stalks; while the Ait. Br. I, 3 mentions only\nthe highest number.\n\n[17:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_60) The Ka _n_ va text adds, sa hi _k_ ittanam ish _t_\ne, 'for he rules over the thoughts.'\n\n[17:4](sbe2605.htm#fr_61) The Ka _n_ vas read, aya _m_ vava vakpatir yo 'yam\npavate, tad enam esha punati, 'the lord of speech doubtless is that blower\n(purifier, the wind): hence it is he that purifies him.'\n\n[18:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_62) See [p. 8](sbe2604.htm#page_8), note\n[3](sbe2604.htm#fn_34).\n\n[18:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_63) I take ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iyasa _h_ as acc. pl. fem., as\ndoes Mahidh. Perhaps it ought to be translated 'for prayers proper at the\nsacrifice,' whereby he makes sure that each priest uses his own proper prayers\nduring the sacrifice.\n\n[18:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_64) For the symbolic meaning of the closing of the\nhands, see [III, 2, 1, 6](sbe2607.htm#3:2:1:6); Ait. Br. I, 3, 20.\n\n[19:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_65) That is, 'svaha' in each formula. The Sa _m_ hita\nhas twice 'svaha' in the last formula (svaha vatad arabhe svaha), to which\nthis might refer, but neither recension of the Brahma _n_ a mentions the final\n'svaha.'\n\n[19:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_66) Literally, 'he takes within him' (as the speech\nconfined within him through silence).\n\n[19:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_67) That is, he enters the hall by the front (east)\ndoor, then walks along the north side of the \xc3\x82havaniya and altar, and passes\nbetween the Garhapatya and altar to his seat south of the \xc3\x82havaniya. The\nPratiprasthat _ri_ then silently anoints and purifies the Dikshita's wife and\nleads her into the hall, either by the front or back door.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 4.
