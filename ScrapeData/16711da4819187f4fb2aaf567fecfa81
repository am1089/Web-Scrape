 \nThen told the king that ready manned  \nA gay boat waited near the strand.  \nThen Guha, hand to hand applied.  \nWith reverence thus to Rama cried:  \n'The boat is ready by the shore:  \nHow, tell me, can I aid thee more?  \nO lord of men, it waits for thee  \nTo cross the flood that seeks the sea,  \nO godlike keeper of thy vow,  \nEmbark: the boat is ready now.'  \n\n   Then Rama, lord of glory high,  \nThus to King Guha. made reply:  \n'Thanks for thy gracious care, my lord:  \nNow let the gear be placed on board.'  \nEach bow-armed chief, in mail encased,  \nBound sword and quiver to his waist,  \nAnd then with Sita near them hied  \nDown the broad river's shelving side.  \nThen with raised palms the charioteer,  \nIn lowly reverence drawing near,  \nCried thus to Rama good and true:  \n'Now what remains for me to do?'  \n   With his right hand, while answering  \n     The hero touched his friend:  \n   'Go back,' he said, 'and on the king  \n     With watchful care attend.  \nThus far, Sumantra, thou wast guide;  \nNow to Ayodhya turn,' he cried:  \n'Hence seek we leaving steeds and car,  \nOn foot the wood that stretches far.'  \n\nSumantra, when, with grieving heart,  \nHe heard the hero bid him part,  \nThus to the bravest of the brave,  \nIkshvaku's son, his answer gave:  \n'In all the world men tell of naught,  \nTo match thy deed, by heroes wrought--  \nThus with thy brother and thy wife  \nThrall-like to lead a forest life.  \nNo meet reward of fruit repays  \nThy holy lore, thy saintlike days,  \nThy tender soul, thy love of truth,  \nIf woe like this afflicts thy youth.  \nThou, roaming under forest boughs  \n\nWith thy dear brother and thy spouse  \nShalt richer meed of glory gain  \nThan if three worlds confessed thy reign.  \nSad is our fate, O Rama: we,  \nAbandoned and repelled by thee,  \nMust serve as thralls Kaikeyi's will,  \nImperious, wicked, born to ill.'  \n\nThus cried the faithful charioteer,  \nAs Raghu's son, in rede his peer,  \nWas fast departing on his road,--  \nAnd long his tears of anguish flowed.  \nBut Rama, when those tears were dried  \nHis lips with water purified,  \nAnd in soft accents, sweet and clear,  \nAgain addressed the charioteer:  \n'I find no heart, my friend, like thine,  \nSo faithful to Ikshvaku's line.  \nStill first in view this object keep,  \nThat ne'er for me my sire may weep.  \nFor he, the world's far-ruling king,  \nIs old, and wild with sorrow's sting;  \nWith love's great burthen worn and weak:  \nDeem this the cause that thus I speak  \nWhate'er the high-souled king decrees  \nHis loved Kaikeyi's heart to please,  \nYea, be his order what it may,  \nWithout demur thou must obey,  \nFor this alone great monarchs reign,  \nThat ne'er a wish be formed in vain.  \nThen, O Sumantra, well provide  \nThat by no check the king be tried:  \nNor let his heart in sorrow pine:  \nThis care, my faithful friend, be thine  \nThe honoured king my father greet,  \nAnd thus for me my words repeat  \nTo him whose senses are controlled,  \nUntired till now by grief, and old;  \n\nI, Sita, Lakshman sorrow not,  \nO Monarch, for our altered lot:  \nThe same to us, if here we roam,  \nOr if Ayodhya be our home,  \nThe fourteen years will quickly fly,  \nThe happy hour will soon be nigh  \nWhen thou, my lord, again shalt see  \nLakshman, the Maithli dame, and me.  \nThus having soothed, O charioteer,  \nMy father and my mother dear,  \nLet all the queens my message learn.  \nBut to Kaikeyi chiefly turn,  \nWith loving blessings from the three,  \nFrom Lakshman, Sita, and from me,  \nMy mother, Queen Kausalya, greet  \nWith reverence to her sacred feet.  \nAnd add this prayer of mine: 'O King;  \nSend quickly forth and Bharat bring,  \nAnd set him on the royal throne  \nWhich thy decree has made his own.  \nWhen he upon the throne is placed,  \nWhen thy fond arms are round him laced.  \nThine aged heart will cease to ache  \nWith bitter pangs for Rama's sake.'  \n\np. 155  \n\nAnd say to Bharat: 'See thou treat  \nThe queens with all observance meet:  \nWhat care the king receives, the same  \nShow thou alike to every dame.  \nObedience to thy father's will  \nWho chooses thee the throne to fill,  \nWill earn for thee a store of bliss  \nBoth in the world to come and this.'  \n\nThus Rama bade Sumantra go  \nWith thoughtful care instructed so.  \nSumantra all his message heard,  \nAnd spake again, by passion stirred:  \n'O, should deep feeling mar in aught  \nThe speech by fond devotion taught,  \nForgive whate'er I wildly speak:  \nMy love is strong, my tongue is weak.  \nHow shall I, if deprived of thee,  \nReturn that mournful town to see:  \nWhere sick at heart the people are  \nBecause their Rama roams afar.  \nWoe will be theirs too deep to brook  \nWhen on the empty car they look,  \nAs when from hosts, whose chiefs are slain,  \nOne charioteer comes home again.  \nThis very day, I ween, is food  \nForsworn by all the multitude,  \nThinking that thou, with hosts to aid,  \nArt dwelling in the wild wood's shade.  \nThe great despair, the shriek of woe  \nThey uttered when they saw thee go.  \nWill, when I come with none beside,  \nA hundred-fold be multiplied.  \nHow to Kaus'alya can I say:  \n'O Queen, I took thy son away,  \nAnd with thy brother left him well:  \nWeep not for him; thy woe dispel?'  \nSo false a tale I cannot frame,  \nYet how speak truth and grieve the dame?  \nHow shall these horses, fleet and bold,  \nWhom not a hand but mine can hold,  \nBear others, wont to whirl the car  \nWherein Ikshvaku's children are!  \nWithout thee, Prince, I cannot, no,  \nI cannot to Ayodhya go.  \nThen deign, O Rama, to relent,  \nAnd let me share thy banishment.  \nBut if no prayers can move thy heart,  \nIf thou wilt quit me and depart,  \nThe flames shall end my car and me,  \nDeserted thus and reft of thee.  \nIn the wild wood when foes are near,  \nWhen dangers check thy vows austere,  \nBorne in my car will I attend.  \nAll danger and all care to end.  \nFor thy dear sake I love the skill  \nThat guides the steed and curbs his will:  \nAnd soon a forest life will be  \nAs pleasant, for my love of thee.  \nAnd if these horses near thee dwell,  \nAnd serve thee in the forest well,  \nThey, for their service, will not miss  \nThe due reward of highest bliss.  \nThine orders, as with thee I stray.  \nWill I with heart and head obey,  \nPrepared, for thee, without a sigh,  \nTo lose Ayodhya or the sky.  \nAs one denied with hideous sin,  \nI never more can pass within  \nAyodhya, city of our king,  \nUnless beside me thee I bring.  \nOne wish is mine, I ask no more,  \nThat, when thy banishment is o'er  \nI in my car may bear my lord,  \nTriumphant, to his home restored.  \nThe fourteen years, if spent with thee.  \nWill swift as light-winged moments flee;  \nBut the same years, without thee told,  \nWere magnified a hundred-fold.  \nDo not, kind lord, thy servant leave,  \nWho to his master's son would cleave,  \nAnd the same path with him pursue,  \nDevoted, tender, just and true.'  \n\nAgain, again Sumantra made  \nHis varied plaint, and wept and prayed.  \nHim Raghu's son, whose tender breast  \nFelt for his servants, thus addressed:  \nO faithful servant, well my heart  \nKnows how attached and true thou art.  \nHear thou the words I speak, and know  \nWhy to the town I bid thee go.  \nSoon as Kaikeyi, youngest queen,  \nThy coming to the town has seen,  \nNo doubt will then her mind oppress  \nThat Rama roams the wilderness.  \nAnd so the dame, her heart content  \nWith proof of Rama's banishment.  \nWill doubt the virtuous king no more  \nAs faithless to the oath he swore.  \nChief of my cares is this, that she,  \nYoungest amid the queens, may see  \nBharat her son securely reign  \nO'er rich Ayodhya's wide domain.  \nFor mine and for the monarch's sake  \nDo thou thy journey homeward take,  \nAnd, as I bade, repeat each word  \nThat from my lips thou here hast heard.'  \n\nThus spake the prince, and strove to cheer  \nThe sad heart of the charioteer,  \nAnd then to royal Guha said  \nThese words most wise and spirited:  \n'Guha, dear friend, it is not meet  \nThat people throng my calm retreat:  \nFor I must live a strict recluse,  \nAnd mould my life by hermits' use.  \nI now the ancient rule accept  \nBy good ascetics gladly kept.  \nI go: bring fig-tree juice that I  \nIn matted coils my hair may tie.'  \n\nQuick Guha hastened to produce,  \nFor the king's son, that sacred juice.  \nThen Rama of his long locks made,  \nAnd Lakshman's too, the hermit braid.  \n\np. 156  \n\nAnd the two royal brothers there  \nWith coats of bark and matted hair,  \nTransformed in lovely likeness stood  \nTo hermit saints who love the wood.  \nSo Rama, with his brother bold,  \nA pious anchorite enrolled,  \nObeyed the vow which hermits take,  \nAnd to his friend, King Guha, spake:  \n'May people, treasure, army share,  \nAnd fenced forts, thy constant care:  \nAttend to all: supremely hard  \nThe sovereign's task, to watch and guard.'  \n\nIkshvaku's son, the good and brave,  \nThis last farewell to Guha gave,  \nAnd then, with Lakshman and his bride,  \nDetermined, on his way he hied.  \nSoon as he viewed, upon the shore,  \nThe bark prepared to waft them o'er  \nImpetuous Ganga's rolling tide,  \nTo Lakshman thus the chieftain cried:  \n'Brother, embark; thy hand extend,  \nThy gentle aid to Sita lend:  \nWith care her trembling footsteps guide,  \nAnd place the lady by thy side.'  \nWhen Lakshman heard, prepared to aid  \nHis brother's words he swift obeyed.  \nWithin the bark he placed the dame,  \nThen to her side the hero came.  \nNext Lakshman's elder brother, lord  \nOf brightest glory, when on board,  \nBreathing a prayer for blessings, meet  \nFor priest or warrior to repeat,  \nThen he and car-borne Lakshman bent,  \nWell-pleased, their heads, most reverent,  \nTheir hands, with Sita, having dipped,  \nAs Scripture bids, and water sipped,  \nFarewell to wise Sumantra said,  \nAnd Guha, with the train he led.  \nSo Rama took, on board, his stand,  \nAnd urged the vessel from the land.  \nThen swift by vigorous arms impelled  \nHer onward course the vessel held,  \nAnd guided by the helmsman through  \nThe dashing waves of Ganga flew.  \nHalf way across the flood they came,  \nWhen Sita, free from spot and blame,  \nHer reverent hands together pressed,  \nThe Goddess of the stream addressed:  \n'May the great chieftain here who springs  \nFrom Das'aratha, best of kings,  \nProtected by thy care, fulfil  \nHis prudent father's royal will.  \nWhen in the forest he has spent  \nHis fourteen years of banishment,  \nWith his dear brother and with me  \nHis home again my lord shall see,  \nReturning on that blissful day.  \nI will to thee mine offerings pay,  \nDear Queen, whose waters gently flow,  \nWho canst all blessed gifts bestow.  \nFor, three-pathed Queen, though wandering here,  \nThy waves descend from Brahma's sphere,  \nSpouse of the God o'er floods supreme,  \nThough rolling here thy glorious stream.  \nTo thee, fair Queen, my head shall bend,  \nTo thee shall hymns of praise ascend,  \nWhen my brave lord shall turn again,  \nAnd, joyful, o'er his kingdom reign.  \nTo win thy grace, O Queen divine,  \nA hundred thousand fairest kine,  \nAnd precious robes and finest meal  \nAmong the Brahmans will I deal.  \nA hundred jars of wine shall flow,  \nWhen to my home, O Queen, I go;  \nWith these, and flesh, and corn, and rice,  \nWill I, delighted, sacrifice.  \nEach hallowed spot, each holy shrine  \nThat stands on these fair shores of thine,  \nEach fane and altar on thy banks  \nShall share my offerings and thanks.  \nWith me and Lakshman, free from harm,  \nMay he the blameless, strong of arm,  \nReseek Ayodhya from the wild,  \nO blameless Lady undefiled!'  \n\nAs, praying for her husband's sake,  \nThe faultless dame to Ganga spake,  \nTo the right bank the vessel flew  \nWith her whose heart was right and true.  \nSoon as the bark had crossed the wave,  \nThe lion leader of the brave,  \nLeaving the vessel on the strand,  \nWith wife and brother leapt to land.  \nThen Rama thus the prince addressed  \nWho filled with joy Sumitra's breast:  \n'Be thine alike to guard and aid  \nIn peopled spot, in lonely shade.  \nDo thou, Sumitra's son, precede:  \nLet Sita walk where thou shalt lead.  \nBehind you both my place shall be,  \nTo guard the Maithil dame and thee.  \nFor she, to woe a stranger yet,  \nNo toil or grief till now has met;  \nThe fair Videhan will assay  \nThe pains of forest life to-day.  \nTo-day her tender feet must tread  \nRough rocky wilds around her spread:  \nNo tilth is there, no gardens grow,  \nNo crowding people come and go.'  \n\nThe hero ceased: and Lakshman led  \nObedient to the words he said:  \nAnd Sita followed him, and then  \nCame Raghu's pride, the lord of men.  \nWith Sita walking o'er the sand  \nThey sought the forest, bow in hand,  \nBut still their lingering glances threw  \nWhere yet Sumantra stood in view.  \nSumantra, when his watchful eye  \nThe royal youths no more could spy,  \nTurned from the spot whereon he stood  \nHomeward with Guha from the wood.  \n\np. 157  \n\nStill on the brothers forced their way  \nWhere sweet birds sang on every spray,  \nThough scarce the eye a path could find  \nMid flowering trees where creepers twined  \nFar on the princely brothers pressed,  \nAnd stayed their feet at length to rest  \nBeneath a fig tree's mighty shade  \nWith countless pendent shoots displayed.  \nReclining there a while at ease,  \nThey saw, not far, beneath fair trees  \nA lake with many a lotus bright  \nThat bore the name of Lovely Sight.  \nRama his wife's attention drew,  \nAnd Lakshman's, to the charming view:  \n'Look, brother, look how fair the flood  \nGlows with the lotus, flower and bud.'  \n\nThey drank the water fresh and clear,  \nAnd with their shafts they slew a deer.  \nA fire of boughs they made in haste,  \nAnd in the flame the meat they placed.  \nSo Raghu's sons with Sita shared  \nThe hunter's meal their hands prepared,  \nThen counselled that the spreading tree  \nTheir shelter and their home should be.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[154:1](ry130.htm#fr_324) Daughter of Jahnu, a name of the Ganges, See p. 55.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LIII.: Rama's Lament.](ry131.htm)\n\n"
