They should be green (fresh); for that is (what constitutes) their\nliving element, by that they are vigorous, by that possessed of strength: for\nthis reason they should be green.\n\n1:3:4:22\\. The middle stick he lays down first (on the west side of the fire),\nwith the text (Va _g_. S. II, 3), 'May the Gandharva Vi _s_ vavasu 2 lay thee\naround\n\np. 91\n\nfor the security of the All! Thou art a fence to the sacrificer, thou (art)\nAgni, invoked and worthy of invocation!'\n\n1:3:4:33\\. He then lays down the southern one, with the text (ib.), 'Thou art\nIndra's arm for the security of the All! Thou art a fence to the sacrificer;\nthou Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!'\n\n1:3:4:44\\. He then lays down the northern one, with the text (ib.), 'May\nMitra-Varu _n_ a lay thee around in the north with firm law for the security\nof the All! Thou art a fence to the sacrificer, thou Agni, invoked and worthy\nof invocation!' They are indeed Agnis, and for that reason he says, 'Agni,\ninvoked and worthy of invocation!'\n\n1:3:4:55\\. Thereupon he puts on (the fire) a samidh (kindling-stick). He first\ntouches with it the middle enclosing-stick: thereby he first kindles those\n(three Agnis). After that he puts it on the fire: thereby he kindles the\nvisible fire.\n\n1:3:4:66\\. He puts it on 1, with the gayatri stanza (Va _g_. S. II, 4), 'Thee,\nO Sage, who callest (the gods) to the feast, we will kindle so as to shine\nbrilliantly; thee, O Agni, mighty at the sacrifice!' He thereby kindles the\ngayatri 2; the gayatri, when kindled, kindles the other metres; and the\nmetres, when kindled, carry the sacrifice to the gods.\n\np. 92\n\n1:3:4:77\\. By the second kindling-stick (samidh), which he now puts on, he\nkindles the spring; the spring, when kindled, kindles the other seasons; and\nthe seasons, when kindled, cause living beings to be produced and the plants\nto ripen. He puts it on, with the formula (Va _g_. S. II, 5), 'A kindler\n(samidh) art thou!' for the spring is indeed a kindler.\n\n1:3:4:88\\. When he has put it on, he murmurs (ib.), 'May the sun guard thee\nfrom the east against any imprecation!' for the enclosing-sticks serve for\nprotection on all (the other three) sides; and thereby he makes the sun the\nprotector on the east side, fearing 'lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas,\nshould rush in from the east:' for the sun is the repeller of the evil\nspirits, the Rakshas.\n\n1:3:4:99\\. By that third kindling-stick, then, which he puts on at the after-\nofferings 1, he kindles the officiating priest (brahma _n_ a); and he, the\npriest, when kindled, carries the sacrifice to the gods.\n\n1:3:4:1010\\. He now returns to the altar covered (with sacrificial grass).\nHaving taken two stalks of grass, he lays them down across (the barhis or\ngrass covering, with the tops to the north), with the formula (Va _g_. S. II,\n5), 'Savit _ri_ 's arms 2 are ye!' The prastara bunch is indeed the top-knot\n(of the sacrifice); and he now lays down these two crosswise as its eye-brows:\nthereby these two (represent) the transverse eye-brows. The prastara, further,\n\np. 93\n\n[paragraph continues] (represents) the kshatra (or military class); and the\nother barhis the vi _s_ (or, the common \xc3\x82ryan people);--(and the two stalks he\nputs down between them) for the sake of separating (vidh _ri_ ti) the kshatra\nand the vi _s_ : for this reason he lays them down crosswise; and for this\nreason these two (stalks) are called vidh _ri_ ti.\n\n1:3:4:1111\\. On them he spreads the prastara, with the formula (Va _g_. S. II,\n5), 'I spread thee, soft as wool, pleasant to sit upon for the gods!' When he\nsays 'thee, soft as wool,' he means to say 'agreeable to the gods;' and by\n'pleasant to sit upon for the gods' he means to say 'forming a good seat for\nthe gods.'\n\n1:3:4:1212\\. He presses it down (with his left hand), with the text (ib.),\n'May the Vasus, the Rudras, the \xc3\x82dityas sit on thee!' These three, that is,\nthe Vasus, the Rudras, and the \xc3\x82dityas, namely, are (classes of) gods; and\nthese, he means to say, are to sit down on it. While it is still being held\ndown with his left hand,--\n\n1:3:4:1313\\. He seizes the _g_ uhu with his right, fearing 'lest the evil\nspirits, the Rakshas, should enter there in the meantime;' for the officiating\npriest (brahma _n_ a) is the repeller of the Rakshas: therefore, while it (the\nprastara) is still being held down with his left hand,--\n\n1:3:4:1414\\. He seizes the _g_ uhu, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 6), 'Fond of\nbutter art thou, _G_ uhu by name!' for fond of butter indeed it is, and _G_\nuhu by name;--'Sit down here with the favourite resort 1 (or dainty) on the\nfavourite seat!' The upabh _ri_ t (he takes), with the formula (ib.), 'Fond of\nbutter art thou, Upabh _ri_ t\n\np. 94\n\nby name!' for fond of butter indeed it is, and Upabh _ri_ t by name;--'Sit\ndown here with the favourite resort on the favourite seat!' The dhruva (he\ntakes) with 'Fond of butter art thou, Dhruva by name!' for fond of butter\nindeed it is, and Dhruva by name;--'Sit down here with the favourite resort on\nthe favourite seat!' What other sacrificial food there is, (he puts down on\nthe prastara), with the formula, 'With the favourite resort sit down on the\nfavourite seat!'\n\n1:3:4:1515\\. He lays the _g_ uhu down on (the prastara), and the other spoons\ndown below, (viz. on the barhis, north of the _g_ uhu, and so as not to touch\nit or one another); for the _g_ uhu assuredly is the kshatra, and the other\nspoons (sru _k_ ) are the vi _s_ : he thereby makes the kshatra superior to\nthe vi _s_. Hence the people here serve, from a lower position, the Kshatriya\nseated above them: for this reason he places the _g_ uhu upon (the prastara)\nand the other spoons down below it.\n\n1:3:4:1616\\. He touches the offerings, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 6),\n'Safely they have sat down,' for safely indeed they sat down;--'in the lap\n(yoni) of divine truth!' for the sacrifice is indeed the lap of divine truth,\nand in the sacrifice they sat down;--'Protect these, O Vish _n_ u! protect the\nsacrifice! protect the lord of sacrifice!' thereby he refers to the\nsacrificer;--'Protect me, the leader of the sacrifice!' thereby he does not\nexclude himself either from the sacrifice. Vish _n_ u, assuredly, is the\nsacrifice: hence it is to the sacrifice that he makes all that over for\nprotection. This is the reason why he says, 'Protect these, O Vish _n_ u!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[90:1](sbe1214.htm#fr_257) The Brahman, or supreme spirit (? or, sacred writ),\nis more than once identified with the Pala _s_ a tree in the _S_ atapatha Br.,\nas in V, 2, 4, 18; VI, 6, 3, 7; XII, 7, 2, 15; and with the leaf of that tree\n(pala _s_ asya pala _s_ am) in II, 6, 2, 8. [? Cf. Rig-veda X, 31, 7, 'Which\nwas the wood, which was the tree, out of which they fashioned heaven and\nearth?' and Taitt. Br. II, 8, 9, 6, 'Brahma was the wood, Brahma was that tree\nout of which they fashioned heaven and earth;' also Ath.-veda X, 7, 38, 'The\ngods form part of the divine essence (Skambha-Brahma) as branches of a tree.']\n\n[90:2](sbe1215.htm#fr_258) The genius Vi _s_ vavasu is already mentioned in\nRig-veda X, 85, 21 seq., and X, 139, 4, where Grassmann identifies him with\nthe rainbow (cf. Roth, Nirukta notes, p. 245). See also _S_ at. Br. III, 2, 4,\n2; XIV, 9, 4, 18.\n\n[91:1](sbe1215.htm#fr_259) According to Saya _n_ a, the two sticks or pieces\nof wood are put on the fire in a manner similar to that in which the two\nagharas or sprinklings of clarified butter are made (see I, 4, 4-5); viz. the\nfirst in the direction north-west to south-east, and the second from south-\nwest to north-east.\n\n[91:2](sbe1215.htm#fr_260) The gayatri is the first of the three principal\nmetres, cf. [p. 80](sbe1213.htm#page_80), note [3](sbe1213.htm#fn_241). It\nconsists of three octo-syllabic padas, of which Rig-veda I, 164, 25\nsays,--'The gayatra, they say, has three flames (or firebrands, samidh):\ntherefore it excelled in grandeur and power.'\n\n[92:1](sbe1215.htm#fr_261) See I, 8, 2, 3.\n\n[92:2](sbe1215.htm#fr_262) Bahu, 'the two arms,' is apparently taken here by\nour author both in its natural sense and as the arms of the bow or arch,\nformed by the eye-brows. The barhis, or grass covering of the altar, was, as\nwe saw (I, 3, 3, 7), identified with the beard and other hair of the body.\n\n[93:1](sbe1215.htm#fr_263) Viz. the butter, which is the dear resort, or home,\nof the gods; see I, 3, 2, 17. Possibly, however, dhaman may here mean\n'dainty.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 5. Fifth Brahma _n_ a](sbe1216.htm)\n\n"
