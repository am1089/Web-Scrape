Everyone had free access. He talked with everybody who came.\nHis visitors were from all classes of people,--Sannyasins * and Paramahamsas,\n\xe2\x80\xa0 Hindus, Christians and Brahmos, Saktas, Vaishnavas and Shaivas,--women as\nwell as men. It was noon. Sri Ramakrishna was seated in His usual place in His\nroom. A disciple came and saluted Him, falling at His\n\np. 180\n\nhallowed feet. The Bhagavan made him sit down and kindly inquired after the\nwelfare of himself and of his family. A short while after the Bhagavan began\nto talk to him upon the Vedanta. He said:\n\nNon-dualistic Vedantins.The Astavakara Samhita * deals with the knowledge of\nthe \xc3\x82tman (Self). The knowers of the Self declare: "I am He, I am that Supreme\nSelf." This is the view of all the Sannyasins belonging to the non-dualistic\n(Advaita) school of Vedanta. But it is not meet that a man of the world should\nhold such a view. He is doing all kinds of work; how at the same time can he\nbe that Highest Self, the Absolute Brahman, who is beyond all actions? The\nNon-dualistic Vedantins hold that the Self has no attachment to anything.\nPleasure, pain, virtue, vice, can never affect the Self in any way; but they\ndo affect men who think that their soul is the same as the body. Smoke can\nblacken only the wall, but not the space through which it moves. There was a\ncertain devotee named Krishna Kisore, who used to say that he was _Kha_ , or\nempty space. He\n\np. 181\n\nmeant that he was the same as the Highest Self, Brahman the Absolute, who is\nsometimes likened to \xc3\x82kasa (infinite space) because nothing can be predicated\nof It. A true philosopher has some right to say this. As for others, such a\nsentiment is altogether out of place.\n\nThought of freedom brings freedom. But it is good for everyone to cherish the\nidea that he is free. "I am free," "I am free"; if a man constantly says this,\nhe is sure to be free. On the other hand, he who always thinks that he is in\nbondage brings bondage on himself in the end. The weak-minded man who always\nsays, "I am a sinner," "I am a sinner," is sure to have a fall. A man should\nrather say: "I repeat the Holy Name of God; how can there be any sin in me, or\nbondage of the world?"\n\nThen turning towards the disciple, the Bhagavan said:\n\nTo-day my mind is not at ease. I hear from Hridai * that he has been ailing\nmuch. Is this\n\np. 182\n\nMaya and Daya.anxiety due to Maya (attachment) or Daya (compassion) towards\nhim?\n\nThe disciple did not know what to reply and remained silent.\n\nSri Ramakrishna: Do you know what is Maya? Love towards one\'s own father,\nbrother, sister, wife, child, nephew, niece, is called Maya, and compassion\nmeans loving all beings equally. Now what is this, my anxiety, due to--Maya or\ncompassion? But Hridai did a great deal for me. He served me much. He never\nhesitated to do all sorts of menial services for me. My mind will be set at\nrest if he can get the money he needs. Now whom am I to ask for money? And how\ncan I ask, being a Sannyasin?\n\nAt two or three o\'clock in the afternoon two great devotees, Adhar * and\nBalaram, came and prostrated themselves before Him and took their seats. They\nasked Him how He was doing. The Bhagavan replied: "Well, my body is all right,\nbut not so is the mind." He did not mention anything about Hridaya\'s illness.\n\np. 183\n\nii\n\nIn the course of the conversation, when the talk was about the Goddess _Simhav\nahini_ * (seated upon a lion) belonging to the Mullik family of Barabazar, He\nsaid: Once I went to see the Simhavahini. She was then staying in one Mullik\'s\nhouse at Chashadhopapara. The house was almost a deserted one. The family had\nbecome very poor. In some places there was filth, in other places mosses were\ngrowing undisturbed. The cement upon the wall was crumbling down, and brick-\ndust and sand were slowly falling. Other houses belonging to the Mulliks are\nvery neat and clean, but this was not so. Can you explain why this was the\ncase? The truth is that everyone must reap the fruit of his past actions. Law\nof Karma.We should believe in the law of Karma. One thing, however, I saw in\nthat deserted house,--that the face of the Goddess was beaming with glory. The\nDivine Presence in images.We should believe in the Divine Presence infilling\nthe images of the Deity.\n\np. 184\n\nI went to Vishnupura. * The Raja has several good temples. In one of the\ntemples there is the image of a Goddess named Mrinmayi. A big tank is before\nthe temple. But how was it that I smelled in the tank the spices that women\nuse to perfume their hair? I did not know that they offered such spices to the\nGoddess when they went to worship her. I had not seen her image near the tank,\nbut in Samadhi I saw her Divine form down to her waist. The Divine Mother of\nthe universe appeared to me in the form of Mrinmayi.\n\nBy this time other devotees had arrived. The talk then turned on the Kabul war\nand the civil war that came after. One gave the news that Yakub Khan \xe2\x80\xa0 had\nbeen deposed from his throne, adding: Sir, Yakub Khan is a great devotee.\n\nTrials of a devotee.Sri Ramakrishna: Well, pleasure and pain, happiness and\nmisery, are things one cannot separate from the body. We read in Kavi\nKankana\'s \xe2\x80\xa1 "Chandi" that Kaluvira, a great devotee, was shut up in prison.\n\np. 185\n\n[paragraph continues] They placed a heavy stone upon his breast. Yet Kalu was\nthe favorite child of the Mother of the universe. Pleasure and pain, happiness\nand misery, come with the body. How great a devotee was Srimanta! How fondly\nthe goddess loved his mother Khullana! But what an amount of trouble he had to\ngo through! They took him to the scaffold to be executed. A certain woodman, a\ngreat devotee, was fortunate enough to see the goddess, and the goddess loved\nhim very much and showed her kindness towards him; but he had to go on with\nthe trade of woodcutter all the same. He had to sell firewood to get his\nlivelihood. It does not follow that a devoted lover of God must be very well\noff in the world. A devotee is rich in spirit.But he is rich in spirit, though\nhe may be poor in worldly things. Devaki in prison saw God in the form of a\nhuman being holding the conch-shell, discus, mace and lotus in His four hands;\nbut she could not get out of the prison for all her God-vision.\n\nDisciple: But she should have got rid, not only of imprisonment, but of her\nbody, that being the source of all her troubles.\n\np. 186\n\nBody result of past actions.Bhagavan: One\'s body is the result of one\'s past\nactions. Therefore one must bear with it so long as the past actions are not\ncleared up. A blind man taking a bath in the holy water of the Ganges has his\nsins washed off, but his blindness continues all the same. It is the result of\nthe actions of his previous life. But however the body may be under the\ninfluence of pleasure and pain, however the body may be happy or miserable,\nthe true devotee is all the same rich in spirit, rich in knowledge (Jnana) and\nthe love of God (Bhakti). Take for instance the Pandavas. How many dangers and\ndifficulties they had to face! What wants and miseries to bear! But amidst all\nthese they never lost their wisdom. Can you find others equally wise and\ndevoted to God?\n\nAt this time Narendra (Swami Vivekananda) and Visvanatha Upadhyaya, * the\nNepaulese Resident in Calcutta, entered. Bowing down to Sri Ramakrishna, they\ntook their seats. Sri Ramakrishna asked Narendra to sing. There\n\np. 187\n\nwas hanging on the western wall of the room a Tanpura (a stringed musical\ninstrument). Narendra took it down and began to tune it. Everyone was intently\nlooking upon his face, eager to listen to his songs.\n\nBhagavan to Narendra: This instrument no longer sounds as before.\n\nVisvanatha: It is filled, therefore there is no sound, as with a vessel filled\nwith water.\n\nSri Ramakrishna: But how do you explain the life of Narada and of other Divine\nTeachers? They had realized God, but still spoke. They were filled, but they\ngave forth sounds.\n\nVisvanatha: They spoke for the good of mankind.\n\nBhagavan: Yes, Narada and Sukadeva came down from the highest state of\nSamadhi. Their hearts went out to those who were weary and heavy-laden and\nknew not God. They spoke for the good of others.\n\nNarendra began to sing:\n\n1\\. In the temple of the heart dwelleth the Eternal Truth.  \nEver beholding His glorious and lovely form, when shall we dive in the sea of\nHis Beauty?\n\np. 188\n\n2\\. In the form of Infinite Wisdom the Lord will enter my soul.  \nThe restless mind filled with wonder will take refuge at His Blessed Feet.  \nImmortal Bliss, like embodied nectar, will rise in the firmament of the soul.\n\n3\\. At Thy sight we shall be mad with joy even as the _Chakora_  * is maddened\nat the sight of the moon.\n\n4\\. O King of kings, there is none like Thee, all good and all peaceful.  \nAt Thy feet, O Beloved, I shall offer myself and thus fulfil the aim of my\nlife.\n\n5\\. Even here shall I enjoy heavenly bliss, so great a privilege where could I\nfind?\n\n6\\. O Lord, beholding Thy pure and perfect form, all sins will take flight,\neven as darkness vanishes before light.\n\n7\\. O kindle in my heart the light of burning faith, fixed firm like the polar\nstar, and thus, O Friend of the meek, fulfil ray one desire. Day and night\nmerged in the\n\np. 189\n\n[paragraph continues] Bliss of Thy Love. O I shall forget myself having\nattained to Thee.  \n              (O when will this come?)\n\nSamadhi of Ramakrishna.Sri Ramakrishna had lost Himself in deep Samadhi as\nsoon as He had heard the words "Immortal bliss like embodied nectar." There He\nsat with clasped hands, turning His face toward the East. He was diving deep\ninto the Ocean of Beauty of the All-Blissful One. No external consciousness,\nno sign of breathing, no motion in any of His limbs, no quiver of the eye,--\nlike one drawn in a picture! He had gone away somewhere from this kingdom,\nfrom this world of the senses.\n\nReturning from Samadhi, the Bhagavan murmured in an indistinct voice: "Thou\nart I, I am Thou. Thou eatest, Thou and I eat. What is this? Have I jaundiced\neyes? I see Thee everywhere. Wherever I cast my eyes, I see Thy form." Then He\nrepeated the holy name of Krishna: "O Friend of the meek and gentle! O Lord of\nmy heart! O Divine Shepherd!" After repeating this a few times, He again went\ninto Samadhi. Coming back to sense-consciousness, He opened His eyes and found\nthat the room was full of people of every\n\np. 190\n\nclass. Narendra, seeing that the Bhagavan was in Samadhi, had left the room\nand gone to the eastern veranda, where Hazra * was seated on a blanket telling\nhis beads. Narendra began to talk with him. In the meanwhile the Bhagavan\nlooked for Narendra in the room, but he was not there. The _T anpura_ (musical\ninstrument) was lying on the ground. The devotees all had their eyes fixed\nupon the Bhagavan, who began thus, referring to Narendra: He has lighted the\nfire. It matters not whether he remains in the room or leaves it!\n\nBliss comes in meditation.Then turning towards Visvanatha and His numerous\ndevotees, He said: Meditate upon God, the sole Existence, Knowledge and Bliss\nEternal, and you also shall have bliss. That Being of Knowledge and Bliss is\nalways here and everywhere, only It is covered and obscured by ignorance. The\nless is your attachment towards the senses, the more will be your love for\nGod.\n\nVisvanatha: The more we near our home at Calcutta, the farther we are from\nBenares, and the more we near Benares, the farther we are away from our home.\n\np. 191\n\nLover of God.Bhagavan: As Srimati (Radha) * neared Sri Krishna, she perceived\nmore and more the charming fragrance of His sweet person. The more one\napproaches God, the more does one\'s love toward Him increase. The more the\nriver nears the sea, the more it is subject to ebb and flow. The Ganges of\nknowledge flowing in the soul of a wise man runs only in one direction. To him\nthe whole universe is a dream. He always lives in His own True Self (\xc3\x82tman).\nBut the Ganges of love in a devotee\'s heart does not run in one direction. It\nhas its ebb and flow. A devotee laughs, weeps, dances, sings. He wants\nsometimes to enjoy his Beloved, to merge into his Beloved! He swims in Him,\ndives, rises up in his joy as merrily as a lump of ice floats upon the water.\nGod the Absolute  and God the Creator one.But in fact God the Absolute and God\nthe Creator are one and the same Being. The Absolute Existence-Intelligence-\nBliss is the All-knowing, All-intelligent and All-blissful Mother of the\nUniverse. The precious stone ( _Mani_ ) and its brightness cannot be separated\nin thought, for\n\np. 192\n\nwe cannot think of the stone without its brightness, nor can we think of the\nbrightness apart from the stone. The Absolute Existence-Intelligence-Bliss,\nthe Undifferentiated, appears as differentiated into many. He has various\nnames applied to Him according to the various powers manifested. That is the\nreason of His having many forms. Hence a devotee has sung: "O my Mother Tara,\n* Thou art even all that." Wherever there is action, such as creation,\npreservation and destruction, there is Sakti or Intelligent Energy. But water\nis water whether it is calm or disturbed. That One Absolute Existence-\nIntelligence-Bliss is also the eternally Intelligent Energy which creates,\npreserves and destroys the universe. Thus it is the same Visvanatha whether he\ndoes nothing or performs his worship or visits the Governor-General. In all\ncases it is the same Visvanatha, only these are his different Upadhis or\nstates.\n\nVisvanatha: Yes, Sir, that is so.\n\nBhagavan: I said this to Keshab Chandra Sen.\n\np. 193\n\nVisvanatha: Well, Sir, Keshab Chandra Sen does not respect our orthodox Hindu\nmanners, customs and laws. How can he be a real saint?\n\nThe Bhagavan (turning towards His devotees): Visvanatha never wants me to go\nto see Keshab Sen.\n\nVisvanatha: But Thy Holiness will go. What can I do?\n\nBhagavan: You go to see the Governor-General, who according to your Shastras *\nis a Mleccha (unclean), and for money, too; and may I not go to see Keshab\nSen? It does not become you to speak in this way. You often say: "It is God\nwho has manifested Himself as the human soul and the world itself." What you\nsay you must mean; what you mean you must say!\n\nAfter this Ramakrishna abruptly left the room and went to the northeastern\nveranda. Visvanatha and other devotees remained waiting for Him in the room.\nNarendra was found talking with Hazra on the veranda. Sri Ramakrishna knew\nthat Hazra was an out-and-out non-dualist and a dry logician. He upheld that\nall the universe was a mere dream; that all\n\np. 194\n\nkinds of worship and offerings were mental delusions; that God was the one\nchangeless Entity; and that a man should only meditate upon his \xc3\x82tman (Self),\nand do nothing else.\n\nBhagavan (laughing): What are you talking about?\n\nNarendra: We are discussing themes all too big for ordinary mortals.\n\nPure Bhakti and pure Jnana one.Bhagavan. (laughing): But however you may talk,\nknow that pure selfless devotion (Bhakti) and pure selfless knowledge (Jnana)\nare both one; their goal is the same Smooth and easy is the path of devotion\nleading to God.\n\nNarendra: There is no use in reasoning like a philosopher; make me, O Mother,\nmad with Thy love. I have been reading Hamilton\'s Philosophy, and he writes:\n"A learned ignorance is the end of philosophy and the beginning of religion."\n\nBhagavan: What does that mean?\n\nNarendra explained it in Bengali. Sri Ramakrishna laughed and thanked him in\nEnglish, saying, "Thank you!" Everyone laughed at this, for the Bhagavan\'s\nknowledge of English was confined to a few such expressions.\n\np. 195\n\niii\n\nSoon twilight began to fall. The devotees one after another took leave of the\nBhagavan, and so did Narendra.\n\nEvening at the Temple.The day was drawing to a close. The Temple-servant was\narranging the lights. The priests were busy saying their prayers as they stood\nwaist-deep in the sacred waters of the Ganges, purifying themselves body and\nsoul. They were shortly to go to their respective temples to perform the _\xc3\x82\nrati_, the evening ceremony. The young men of Dakshineswara had come with\ntheir friends to take a walk in the garden. They were strolling about the\nrampart, enjoying the sweet evening breeze made fragrant by the flowers and\nwatching the slightly undulating breast of the swiftly-flowing Ganges. Some of\nthem, perhaps the more thoughtful, could be found going about by themselves in\nthe solitude of the sacred trees called the _Panchavati_.\n\nBhagavan Sri Ramakrishna also looked at the Ganges for some time from the\nwestern veranda.\n\nIt was evening. The lamp-lighter had lighted all the lamps of the big temple.\nThe old maid-servant\n\np. 196\n\ncame and lit the lamp in the Bhagavan\'s room and burned incense there. In the\nmeantime the \xc3\x82rati ceremony had begun in the twelve shrines dedicated to\nShiva. It began soon after in the temples of Kali, Mother of the Universe, and\nof Sri Vishnu. The united and solemn sound of gongs, bells, cymbals, grew more\nsolemn and sweet as it was echoed back by the murmuring Ganges below.\n\nIt was the first lunar day after the full moon. A short while after nightfall\nthe moon rose. Gradually the tops of the trees in the garden, as well as the\nbig temple compound, were bathed in her balmy light. At the magic touch of her\nradiance the waters of the Ganges shone bright like silver and flowed on\ndancing with great joy.\n\nWhen at nightfall Sri Ramakrishna bowed down to the Divine Mother, He repeated\nthe Holy Names of God, keeping time all the while by clapping his hands. In\nHis room there were pictures of various Incarnations of God. He bowed before\neach picture, repeating the Holy Name of each. He also repeated His favorite\n_mantrams_ , each having some lofty, unifying principle running through it,\nsuch as:\n\n(1) Brahma-\xc3\x82tma-Bhagavan. (The Absolute Brahman of the Vedanta, True Self and\nthe\n\np. 197\n\n[paragraph continues] Personal God of the Bhakta are three in one and one in\nthree.)\n\n(2) Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan. (The Word, the devotee and the Personal God are\nthree in one and one in three.)\n\n(3) Brahma-Sakti, Sakti-Brahma. (God the Absolute and the Creative Energy are\none and the same.)\n\n(4) Veda-Purana-Tantra-Gita-Gayatri. (God of the Scriptures and Holy texts.)\n\n(5) Saranagata, Saranagata. (I take refuge in Thee. I am Thine, I am Thine.)\n\n(6) Naham-Naham, Tuhu-Tuhu. (Not I, not I, but Thou, but Thou.)\n\n(7) Ami Yantra, tumi yantri. (I am the machine; Thou art the One who runs the\nmachine.)\n\nAfter all these repetitions were ended, He meditated upon the Mother Divine\nwith clasped hands.\n\nA few of the devotees had been walking about in the garden during the evening.\nWhen the \xc3\x82rati ceremonies were over in the temples, one after another they\ncame together in Sri Ramakrishna\'s room.\n\nHe was sitting on His seat with devotees before Him on the floor. He said:\nNarendra,\n\np. 198\n\n[paragraph continues] Rakhal and Bhavanatha--these are Nityasiddhas (perfect\neven from their birth). They need no training. What training they go through\nis more than they need. You see that Narendra never cares for anyone. He was\nwith me in Visvanatha\'s carriage the other day. When he was requested to sit\nupon the better seat, he paid no heed at all. Moreover, he never shows to me\nthat he knows anything, lest I praise him before men. He has no Maya, no\nattachment. He looks as if he were free from all bondage. For a single\nindividual he has many gifts and many noble qualities. He is also very\ncourteous in his manners. He knows how to control his senses; he has said that\nhe will not marry, but will live a pure life. That is good. I always go into\nSamadhi when I see him.\n\nCharacter and associations.We mould our character according to the company we\nkeep; and we keep such company as is in harmony with our character. For this\nreason the Paramahamsas (perfected souls) like to keep the company of innocent\nchildren because their minds are pure, simple and unstained by worldliness.\n\nAs Sri Ramakrishna was speaking these words, a worthy Brahmin entered the room\nand bowed\n\np. 199\n\ndown at His feet. The Bhagavan had known him before and loved him because he\nwas sincere and simple. He had studied Vedanta in Benares, the seat of great\nlearning. Ramakrishna said to him: Well, you have not been here for a long\ntime. How are you?\n\nThe Brahmin, smiling, replied: "Revered Sir, the duties of the world, as Thou\nknowest, take most of my time."\n\nHe then took his seat and Ramakrishna continued: You remained in Benares for a\nlong time. Tell us what you saw there. Let us hear something about Dayananda.\n*\n\nBrahmin: Yes, I met Dayananda. Thou hast also seen him.\n\nRamakrishna: Yes, I went to see him once. He was staying in a garden-house not\nvery far from here. That day he had an appointment with Keshab Sen. He was a\ngreat scholar; he also believed in the Devas (perfected spirits), but Keshab\ndid not, whereupon he said: "If\n\np. 200\n\n[paragraph continues] God created all these phenomena, could He not create\nDevas?" He believed in one God, but without form. Visvanatha was repeating the\nHoly Name of the Lord, "Rama, Rama"; at this he said: "Better repeat the name\n\'Sandesha, Sandesha\' (sweetmeat, sweetmeat)."\n\nBrahmin: In Benares, Dayananda had long theological discussions with the other\npandits. In the end all the pandits unanimously stood on one side, while he\nstood alone on the other; and then the pandits drove him from the city by\nraising the outcry: "Dayananda\'s position is false and must not be accepted!"\nI also saw Colonel Olcott, the Theosophist. The theosophists believe in the\nexistence of the Mahatmas, the realm of the moon, the realm of the sun and the\nastral realms. They believe that the astral bodies go to these places and so\non. Revered Sir, what dost Thou think of Theosophy?\n\nDevotion to the Supreme.Ramakrishna: Bhakti, devotion to the Supreme, is the\nonly thing worth having. Do they seek Bhakti? Then it is good. If their aim be\nthe realization of God, then they are all right; but by simply dwelling upon\nthese realms and Mahatmas one cannot search after God. One should practise\nSadhana (devotional exercises) to attain true Bhakti.\n\np. 201\n\n[paragraph continues] One should have extreme longing for realization. One\nshould gather up all the mental activities and concentrate them upon Him.\nRealization of God does not come so easily; it requires a great deal of\nSadhana. A man asked: "Why can I not see God?" I replied: "If you wish to\ncatch a big fish, which lives in deep water, you will have to make many\npreparations to attract him. You must get the line, rod, hook and float; you\nmust put on savory bait; then when you see bubbles in the water, you may know\nthat he has come near. Similarly, if you wish to see God, devote yourself to\nthe practice of true Bhakti."\n\nBhakti and Jnana.A devotee: Which is better, Bhakti or Jnana?\n\nRamakrishna: The highest form of Bhakti comes through extreme love for God.\nThree friends were walking through a forest. A tiger appeared. One of them\ncried out: "Brother, we shall be devoured by the tiger"; the second said: "Why\nshall we be devoured? Come, let us pray to the Lord." Hearing this, the third\none replied: "Oh no, why trouble the Lord? Let us climb this tree." The man\nwho said, "We shall be devoured," did not know that the Lord is the protector\nof all; he who wished to pray to the Lord\n\np. 202\n\nwas a Jnani; he knew that the Lord is the Creator, Protector and Destroyer of\nall phenomena; but the third man, who said, "Why trouble the Lord, let us\nclimb the tree," was a true lover of God. He had had the taste of Divine Love,\nthe highest form of Bhakti. In one aspect of Divine Love (Prema) the lover\nthinks of himself as greater than the object of love; he has the constant\ndesire to protect the Beloved and make Him happy by removing all troubles and\nanxieties. The Gopis had true Prema, or Divine Love.\n\nDivine Love and its various aspects.In Divine Love the sense of "I" and "mine"\nexists, as was shown by the mother of the Divine Incarnation, Krishna. For\nher, Krishna was only a son and not the Lord of the universe. She loved to\nnurse Him and take care of Him, always calling Him "my Krishna," and feeling\nthe same anxiety about Him that an earthly mother would feel about her son.\nWhen a certain saint spoke to her, saying: "Your Krishna is the absolute\nMaster of the world; He is not human"; Yasoda, the mother of Krishna, replied:\n"Oh no, He is not the Lord of the universe; He is my child. I cannot think of\nHim as other than my child." Divine Love is manifested\n\np. 203\n\nby various relations; the closer the relation, the stronger the tie of love.\nThe relation of a servant to his master was manifested by Hanuman; the\nrelation of a friend to his friend was shown by Arjuna to Krishna; while the\nGopis were devoted to the Lord as their Divine husband.\n\nSome people think that they are bound (Baddha), that they will never attain to\nDivine Wisdom, or to Divine Love. But all this fear vanishes from the heart of\na true disciple if his Guru, or spiritual guide, be gracious to him. Parable\nof the tiger.There was a flock of sheep in the woods; suddenly a tigress\njumped into their midst. At that moment she gave birth to a cub and died on\nthe spot. The kindhearted sheep took care of the cub, and brought it up among\nthem. They ate grass, the cub followed their example; they bleated, the cub\nalso learned to bleat. In this manner the cub grew up not as a young tiger but\nlike a sheep. One day a full-grown tiger came that way and watched with wonder\nthe grass-eating tiger. The real tiger drew nearer, but the cub began to\nbleat. Then the real tiger dragged him to the edge of a lake and said: "Look\nhere! Compare your face with mine. Is there any\n\np. 204\n\ndifference? You are a tiger like me; grass is not your food; your food is\nanimal flesh." But the grass-eating tiger could not believe it. After a long\ntime the real tiger convinced him that he was of the same species. Then he\ngave him a piece of flesh to eat, but he would not touch it; \'he began once\nmore to bleat and to seek for grass. At last, however, the real tiger forced\nhim to eat animal flesh; at once he liked the taste of the blood, gave up his\ngrass-eating and bleating, and realized that he was not a sheep but a tiger.\nHe then followed the real tiger and became like him.\n\nHuman soul, the child of God.The human soul is the child of God, but it does\nnot know it, and therefore it lives like an ordinary mortal (sheep); but when,\nby the grace of the Guru, he realizes his true nature, he becomes free from\nall fear and attains to perfection. Therefore I say, when the grace of the\nGuru comes, all fear vanishes. He will make you know who you are and what you\nare in reality. You will have to do very little for yourself after you have\nreceived that grace. You will then be able to distinguish between the Real and\nthe unreal and to realize that God is Truth and the world is unreal.\n\np. 205\n\n  Parable of the false Sadhu.A fisherman came to a garden at night and threw\nhis net in the pond to catch some fish. Hearing the noise, the owner sent his\nmen to capture him. The men came with torches in their hands to discover the\nthief. In the meantime the fisherman dropped his net, covered his face with\nashes and sat under a tree, pretending to be a holy man absorbed in\nmeditation. The men could not find the thief; they simply noticed that a holy\nman was meditating under a tree, so they returned to the owner and told him\nwhat they had seen. Everybody then brought flowers, fruits, and sweets to the\nholy man and paid him great honor and respect. Next morning crowds of people\ncame to see the Sadhu and offered to him money and various other things. The\nfisherman thought: "How strange it is! I am not a holy man, still people have\nso much respect for me and I have received so many gifts. If I become a\ngenuine Sadhu (Anchoret), how much more I shall get! Undoubtedly I shall see\nGod." If merely feigning to be a holy man could so far awaken him, what can be\nsaid of him who has practised all virtues in order to become a true holy man!\nHe will realize what is Real and what is\n\np. 206\n\nunreal, that God is Truth and the world is unreal.\n\nA devotee: Where shall I meditate on God? Ramakrishna: The heart is the best\nplace.
