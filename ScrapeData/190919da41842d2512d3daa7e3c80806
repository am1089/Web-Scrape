Not, on account of the difference of character of that; and its being such\n(appears) from Scripture.\n\nThe same opponent who laid stress on the conflict between Scripture and Sm\n_ri_ ti now again comes forward, relying this time (not on Sm _ri_ ti but) on\nsimple reasoning. Your doctrine, he says, as to the world being an effect of\nBrahman which you attempted to prove by a refutation of the Sa _n_ khya Sm\n_ri_ ti shows itself to be irrational for the following reason. Perception and\nthe other means of knowledge show this world with all its sentient and non-\nsentient beings to be of a non-intelligent and impure nature, to possess none\nof the qualities of the Lord, and to have pain for its very essence; and such\na world totally differs in nature from the Brahman, postulated by you, which\nis said to be all-knowing, of supreme lordly power,\n\np. 414\n\nantagonistic to all evil, enjoying unbroken uniform blessedness. This\ndifference in character of the world from Brahman is, moreover, not only known\nthrough Perception, and so on, but is seen to be directly stated in Scripture\nitself; compare 'Knowledge and non-knowledge' (Taitt. Up. II, 6, 1); 'Thus are\nthese objects placed on the subjects, and the subjects on the pra _n_ a' (Kau.\nUp. III, 9); 'On the same tree man sits grieving, immersed, bewildered by his\nown impotence' ( _S_ vet. Up. IV, 7); 'The soul not being a Lord is bound\nbecause he has to enjoy' ( _S_ vet. Up. I, 8); and so on; all which texts\nrefer to the effect, i.e. the world as being non-intelligent, of the essence\nof pain, and so on. The general rule is that an effect is non-different in\ncharacter from its cause; as e.g. pots and bracelets are non-different in\ncharacter from their material causes--clay and gold. The world cannot,\ntherefore, be the effect of Brahman from which it differs in character, and we\nhence conclude that, in agreement with the Sa _n_ khya Sm _ri_ ti, the\nPradhana which resembles the actual world in character must be assumed to be\nthe general cause. Scripture, although not dependent on anything else and\nconcerned with super-sensuous objects, must all the same come to terms with\nratiocination (tarka); for all the different means of knowledge can in many\ncases help us to arrive at a decisive conclusion, only if they are supported\nby ratiocination. For by tarka we understand that kind of knowledge\n(intellectual activity) which in the case of any given matter, by means of an\ninvestigation either into the essential nature of that matter or into\ncollateral (auxiliary) factors, determines what possesses proving power, and\nwhat are the special details of the matter under consideration: this kind of\ncognitional activity is also called uha. All means of knowledge equally stand\nin need of tarka; Scripture however, the authoritative character of which\nspecially depends on expectancy (akanksha), proximity (sannidhi), and\ncompatibility (yogyata), throughout requires to be assisted by tarka. In\naccordance with this Manu says,'He who investigates by means of reasoning, he\nonly knows religious duty, and none other.' It is with a view to such\nconfirmation of\n\np. 415\n\nthe sense of Scripture by means of Reasoning that the texts declare that\ncertain topics such as the Self must be 'reflected on' (mantavya).--Now here\nit might possibly be said that as Brahman is ascertained from Scripture to be\nthe sole cause of the world, it must be admitted that intelligence exists in\nthe world also, which is an effect of Brahman. In the same way as the\nconsciousness of an intelligent being is not perceived when it is in the\nstates of deep sleep, swoon, &c., so the intelligent nature of jars and the\nlike also is not observed, although it really exists; and it is this very\ndifference of manifestation and non-manifestation of intelligence on which the\ndistinction of intelligent and non-intelligent beings depends.--But to this we\nreply that permanent non-perception of intelligence proves its non-existence.\nThis consideration also refutes the hypothesis of things commonly called non-\nintelligent possessing the power, or potentiality, of consciousness. For if\nyou maintain that a thing possesses the power of producing an effect while yet\nthat effect is never and nowhere _seen_ to be produced by it, you may as well\nproclaim at a meeting of sons of barren women that their mothers possess\neminent procreative power! Moreover, to prove at first from the Vedanta-texts\nthat Brahman is the material cause of the world, and from this that pots and\nthe like possess potential consciousness, and therefrom the existence of non-\nmanifested consciousness; and then, on the other hand, to start from the last\nprinciple as proved and to deduce therefrom that the Vedanta-texts prove\nBrahman to be the material cause of the world, is simply to argue in a circle;\nfor that the relation of cause and effect should exist between things\ndifferent in character is just what cannot be proved.--What sameness of\ncharacter, again, of causal substance and effects, have you in mind when you\nmaintain that from the absence of such sameness it follows that Brahman cannot\nbe proved to be the material cause of the world? It cannot be complete\nsameness of all attributes, because in that case the relation of cause and\neffect (which after all requires _some_ difference) could not be established.\nFor we do not observe that in\n\np. 416\n\npots and jars which are fashioned out of a lump of clay there persists the\nquality of 'being a lump' which belongs to the causal substance. And should\nyou say that it suffices that there should be equality in some or any\nattribute, we point out that such is actually the case with regard to Brahman\nand the world, both of which have the attribute of 'existence' and others. The\ntrue state of the case rather is as follows. There is equality of nature\nbetween an effect and a cause, in that sense that those essential\ncharacteristics by which the causal substance distinguishes itself from other\nthings persist in its effects also: those characteristic features, e.g., which\ndistinguish gold from clay and other materials, persist also in things made of\ngold-bracelets and the like. But applying this consideration to Brahman and\nthe world we find that Brahman's essential nature is to be antagonistic to all\nevil, and to consist of knowledge, bliss and power, while the world's\nessential nature is to be the opposite of all this. Brahman cannot, therefore,\nbe the material cause of the world.\n\nBut, it may be objected, we observe that even things of different essential\ncharacteristics stand to each other in the relation of cause and effect. From\nman, e.g., who is a sentient being, there spring nails, teeth, and hair, which\nare non-sentient things; the sentient scorpion springs from non-sentient dung;\nand non-sentient threads proceed from the sentient spider.--This objection, we\nreply, is not valid; for in the instances quoted the relation of cause and\neffect rests on the non-sentient elements only (i.e. it is only the non-\nsentient matter of the body which produces nails, &c.).\n\nBut, a further objection is raised, Scripture itself declares in many places\nthat things generally held to be non-sentient really possess intelligence;\ncompare 'to him the earth said'; 'the water desired'; 'the pra _n_ as\nquarrelling among themselves as to their relative pre-eminence went to\nBrahman.' And the writers of the Pura _n_ as ako attribute consciousness to\nrivers, hills, the sea, and so on. Hence there is after all no essential\ndifference in nature between\n\np. 417\n\nsentient and so-called non-sentient beings.--To this objection the\nPurvapakshin replies in the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5.
