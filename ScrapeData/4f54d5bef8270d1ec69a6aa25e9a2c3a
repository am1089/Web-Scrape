They then fought in the north-eastern\ndirection; there the Devas did not sustain defeat. This direction is _apar\najita, i. e._ unconquerable. Thence one should do work in this direction, and\nhave it done there; for such a one '(alone) is able to clear off his debts.'\nHAUG'S _Aitareyaya Br ahmanam_, Vol. II, p. 33.\n\nThe debts here spoken of are a man's religious obligations to the Gods, the\nPitaras or Manes, and men.\n\n[52:2b](ry041.htm#fr_190) Vishnu.\n\n[52:3b](ry041.htm#fr_191) 'It appears to me that this mythical story has\nreference to the volcanic phenomena of nature. Kapil may very possibly be that\nhidden fiery force which suddenly unprisons itself and bursts forth in\nvolcanic effects. Kapil is, moreover, one of the names of Agni the God of\nFire.'
