After he has studied the Veda, the bath (which signifies the end of his\nstudentship, is taken by him).\n\n2\\. We shall explain that (bath).\n\n3\\. During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon,\nunder (the Nakshatra) Rohi _n_ i, (or) M _ri_ ga _s_ iras, (or) Tishya, (or)\nUttara\n\np. 162\n\n[paragraph continues] Phalguni, (or) Hasta, (or) _K_ itra, or the two Vi _s_\nakhas: under these (Nakshatras) he may take the bath.\n\n4. 4 He goes to a place near which water is, puts wood on the fire, performs the rites down to the oblations made with the Vyah _ri_ tis, and puts a piece of Pala _s_ a wood on (the fire) with (the verse), \'Let us prepare this song like a chariot, for _G_ atavedas who deserves it, with our prayer. For his foresight in this assembly is a bliss to us. Agni! Dwelling in thy friendship may we not suffer harm. Svaha!\'\n\n5\\. Then he sacrifices with the Vyah _ri_ tis as above,\n\n6. 6 (And another oblation with the verse), \'The threefold age of _G_ amadagni, Ka _s_ yapa\'s threefold age, the threefold age that belongs to the gods: may that threefold age be mine. Svaha!\'\n\n7\\. (Then follow oblations with the verses), \'This, O Varu _n_ a,\' &c. (see\nabove, I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the Sutra).\n\n8. 8 After he has served food to the Brahma _n_ as, and has caused them to say, \'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!\' he discharges himself of his vow by (repeating) these (Mantras), \'Agni, lord of the vow, I have kept the vow.\'\n\n9\\. Having (thus) discharged himself of his vow, he worships the sun with the\ntwo (verses), \'Upwards\n\np. 163\n\nthat ( _G_ atavedas)\' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 4, 43, 1), and, \'The bright\'\n(ibid.).\n\n10. 10 With (the words), \'(Loosen) from us thy highest band, Varu _n_ a,\' he takes off the upper garment which he has worn during his studentship, and puts on another (garment). With (the words), \'(Loosen) the lowest (fetter),\' (he takes off) the under garment; with (the words), \'(Take) away the middle (fetter),\' the girdle. With (the words), \'And may we, O \xc3\x82ditya, under thy law (&c.),\' (he deposes) his staff. The girdle, the staff, and the black antelope\'s skin he throws into water, sits down to the west of the fire, facing the east, and touches the razor (with which he is going to be shaven), with (the formula), \'Razor is thy name; the axe is thy father. Adoration to thee! Do no harm to me!\'\n\n11. 11 Having handed over (that razor) to the barber, he touches the water with which his hair is to be moistened, with (the formula), \'Be blissful, (O waters), when we touch you.\' [(The barber) then pours together warm and cold water. Having poured warm (water) into cold (water)\xc2\x97]\n\n12. 12 (The barber) moistens the hair near the right ear with (the words), \'May the waters moisten thee for life, for old age and splendour\' (Taitt. Sa _m_ hita I, 2, 1, 1).\n\np. 164\n\n13. 13 With (the words), \'Herb! protect him\' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h., loc. cit.), he puts an herb with the point upwards into (the hair).\n\n14. 14 With (the words), \'Axe! do no harm to him!\' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h., loc. cit.), he touches (that herb) with the razor.\n\n15\\. With (the words), \'Heard by the gods, I shave that (hair)\' (Taitt. Sa _m_\nh., loc. cit.), he shaves him.\n\n16. 16 With (the formula), \'If thou shavest, O shaver, my hair and my beard with the razor, the wounding, the well-shaped, make our face resplendent, but do not take away our life\'\xc2\x97(the student who is going to take the bath), looks at the barber.\n\n17\\. He has the beard shaven first, then the hair in his arm-pits, then the\nhair (on his head), then the hair of his body, then (he has) his nails (cut).\n\n18\\. A person who is kindly disposed (towards the student), gathers the hair,\nthe beard, the hair of the body, and the nails (that have been cut off), in a\nlump of bull\'s dung, and buries (that lump of dung) in a cow-stable, or near\nan Udumbara tree, or in a clump of Darbha grass, with (the words), \'Thus I\n\np. 165\n\nhide the sin of N.N., who belongs to the Gotra N.N.\'\n\n19\\. Having rubbed himself with powder such as is used in bathing, he cleanses\nhis teeth with a stick of Udumbara wood\xc2\x97\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[162:4](sbe30052.htm#fr_542) 9, 4. Comp.
