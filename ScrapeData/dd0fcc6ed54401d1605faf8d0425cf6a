( _cont_.)\n\np. 360\n\n151\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CLI.\n\nFrom the end there takes place omission or addition.\n\n151c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis refers again to the same subject, namely what has to be done if there are\neither more or less mantras than there are acts which they are to accompany.\nIn that case it is here allowed to use as many mantras as there are acts, and\nto drop the rest of the mantras. Or, if there are less mantras than there are\nacts, then, after the mantras have been equally divided, the last verse is to\nbe multiplied. For instance, in the Dvikapala sacrifice for the two A _s_\nvins, the placing of the two kapalas is accompanied by two mantras. The rest\nof the mantras enjoined in the prak _ri_ ti is left out. But if there are, for\ninstance, twelve or more ish _t_ akas, bricks, to be placed, while there are\nonly ten mantras, then the mantras are equally divided, and the fifth and\ntenth to be repeated, as many times as is necessary to equal the number of the\nish _t_ akas.\n\n152\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CLII.\n\nAs the Prak _ri_ ti has been told before, anything that has not been told\nbefore, should be at the end.\n\n152c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis seems to mean that anything new, peculiar to a Vik _ri_ ti, and not\nmentioned in the Prak _ri_ ti, should come in at the end, that is, after those\nportions of the sacrifice which are enjoined in the Prak _ri_ ti.\n\n153\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CLIII.\n\nThe rule should stand on account of the fitness of the Kumbhi, a large pot,\nthe _S_ ula, the spit for boiling the heart, and the two Vapa _s_ rapa _n_ is,\nthe spits for roasting the vapa.\n\n153c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nKumbhi is explained by sro _n_ yadipakasamartha\n\np. 361\n\nb _ri_ hati sthali; _S_ ula by h _ri_ dayapakartha yash _t_ i _h_ , and Vapa\n_s_ rapa _n_ i by vapa _s_ rapa _n_ arthe yash _t_ i dve. The exact object of\nthe Sutra is not quite clear. Prabhutva is explained by samarthatva, that is,\nfitness. This would mean, that on account of their fitness, or because they\ncan be used for the object for which they are intended, or, so long as they\ncan be used, the rule applying to them should remain. The commentary explains\ntantram by tantrata or ekata. It may mean that the same pots and spits should\nbe used, so long as they fulfil their purpose. The next Sutra would then form\na natural limitation.\n\n154\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CLIV.\n\nBut if there is a different kind of animal, there is difference (in pots and\nspits), owing to the diversity of cooking.\n\n154c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIf different animals are to be cooked, then there must be different pots for\neach (pratipa _s_ um), because each requires a different kind of cooking. The\ncommentary adds that, as the reason for using different pots is given, that\nreason applies also to young and old animals of the same kind ( _g_ ati), i,\ne. the young and small animal would require a different pot and a different\nkind of cooking.\n\n155\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CLV.\n\nAt the Vanaspati sacrifice, which is a modification (vikara) of the Svish _t_\nak _ri_ t, the addresses (nigama) of the deities should take place in the Ya\n_g_ ya, because they are included in the Prak _ri_ ti.\n\n155c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThese nigamas of the deities are not mentioned in the rules of the Vanaspati\nsacrifice, but they are mentioned in the rules for the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t\nsacrifice of the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa, which is the Prak _ri_ ti, and should\ntherefore be taken over. Here again, because a reason is given, it is\n\np. 362\n\nunderstood that the same reason would apply to other portions of Svish _t_ ak\n_ri_ t also, such as the Dvir abhighara _n_ a, which is to be retained in the\nVanaspati sacrifice.\n\n156\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CLVI.\n\nThe Anvarambha _n_ iya or initiatory ceremony does not take place in a Vik\n_ri_ ti, because the Vik _ri_ tis would fall within the time of the Prak _ri_\nti, and the Anvarambha _n_ iya has but one object, namely (the initiation of)\nthe Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa sacrifice.\n\n156c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Anvarambha _n_ iya ceremony has to be performed by those who begin the Dar\n_s_ a-pur _n_ amasa sacrifice. It has thus one object only, and is never\nenjoined for any other cause. It is not therefore transferred to any Vik _ri_\nti, such as the Saurya ceremony, &c. The Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa sacrifice\nhaving to be performed during the whole of life, or during thirty years, the\nVik _ri_ tis would necessarily fall within the same space of time. The\ninitiatory ceremony has reference to the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa sacrifice\nonly, and thus serves as an introduction to all the Vik _ri_ tis, without\nhaving to be repeated for each.\n\n157\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CLVII.\n\nOr (according to others) the Anvarambha _n_ iya should take place (in the Vik\n_ri_ tis also), because the time (of the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa) does not\nform an essential part.\n\n157c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis Sutra is not quite clear. It shows clearly enough that, according to some\nauthorities, the Anvarambha _n_ iya or initiatory ceremony of the Dar _s_\na-pur _n_ amasa sacrifice should take place in the Vik _ri_ tis also; but why?\nBecause the time has not the character of a _s_ esha, which is said to be a\nsynonym of a\xe1\xb9\x85ga, an essential part of a sacrifice.\n\np. 363\n\n[paragraph continues] When it is said that the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa should\nbe performed during life, this is not meant as determining the time of the\nsacrifice. It only means that so long as there is life a man should perform\nthese sacrifices, and that their non-performance would constitute a sin. The\nformer argument, therefore, that the time of the Vik _ri_ ti sacrifices would\nfall within the time of the Prak _ri_ ti sacrifice is not tenable.\n\n158\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CLVIII.\n\nAnd again, because there is difference in the undertaking.\n\n158c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\n\xc3\x82rambha, the beginning, is explained as the determination to perform a certain\nsacrifice (dar _s_ apur _n_ amasabhyay _m_ yakshya iti ni _s_ _k_ ayapura _h_\nsara _h_ sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa _h_ ). The object of the undertaking in the case of the Dar\n_s_ a-pur _n_ amasa sacrifice, as the Prak _ri_ ti, is simply svarga, in the\nVik _ri_ tis it may be any kind of desire. Therefore the Anvarambha _n_ iya\nceremony of the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasas should be transferred to its Vik _ri_\ntis. This seems to have been the opinion of the same authorities who are\nreferred to in Sutra CLVII. The final outcome of the whole controversy,\nhowever, is clearly that our \xc3\x82 _k_ arya is in favour of omitting the\nAnvarambha _n_ iya in the Vik _ri_ tis. Anayo _h_ pakshayor anvarambha _n_\niyabhavapakshasyaiva balavattvam a _k_ aryabhilashitam iti manyamahe. The\nAnvarambha _n_ iya is not to be considered as an ordinary A\xe1\xb9\x85ga, but as a\nspecial act to fit the sacrificer to perform the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa and\nto perform it through the whole of his life.\n\n159\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CLIX.\n\nFor every object (new sacrifice) let him bring forward the fire (let him\nperform the Agnipra _n_ ayana, the fetching of the \xc3\x82havaniya from the\nGarhapatya fire). When the sacrifice is finished\n\np. 364\n\nthe fire becomes again ordinary fire, as when the (divine) fire has returned\n(to the firesticks).\n\n159c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe fire for a sacrifice is supposed to be set apart or consecrated ( _s_\nastriya), but it is so for a special sacrifice only, and when that sacrifice\nis ended, it is supposed to become like ordinary fire again. Artha is prayo\n_g_ ana, the sacrifice for which the fire is intended\n(agnisadhyavihitakarmanush _th_ anam; tasya tasya vihitasya karma _n_ o\xe0\xa4\xbdnush\n_th_ anartha _m_ garhapatyadibhya ahavaniyadyagnim pra _n_ ayet). The\ncommentator remarks that there are two Agnis, the one who is visible, the\nother who is the god. Now while the divine Agni leaves the coals and ascends\nor is absorbed again in the two firesticks (ara _n_ i), the other remains like\nordinary kitchen fire. See on Samaroha _n_ a, Weber, Ind. Stud.
