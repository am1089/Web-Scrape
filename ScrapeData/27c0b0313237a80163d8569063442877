Brahma said :-- Thus speaking, Bhagavan Janardana Vi _sn_ u spoke to me\nagain :-- \xc2\x93Come, let us bow down to Her again and again and let us go to Her.\nWe shall reach at Her feet fearlessly and we will chant hymns to Her; Maha\nMaya will be pleased with us and will grant us boons. If the guards at the\nentrance prevent us from going, we would stand at the gateway and we will\nchant hymns to the Devi with one mind.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nBrahma said :-- When Hari addressed us in the above way, we two became choked\nby intense feelings of joy; our voice became tremulous and\n\n\n\np. 128\n\n\n\nwe waited there for some time; our hearts were elated with joy to go to Her.\nWe then accepted Hari's word said \xc2\x93Om\xc2\x94 and got down from our car and went with\nhastened steps and with fear to the gate. Seeing us standing at the gateway,\nthe Devi Bhagavati smiled and within an instant transformed us three into\nfemales. We looked beautiful and youthful women, adorned with nice ornaments;\nthus we greatly wondered and went to Her. Seeing us standing at Her feet in\nfeminine forms, the beautiful Devi Bhagavati, looked on us with eyes of\naffection. We then bowed to the great Devi, looked at one another and stood\nbefore Her in that feminine dress. We three, then, began to see the pedestal\nof the great Devi, shining with the lustre of ten million Suns and decorated\nwith various gems and jewels. We next discerned that thousands and thousands\nof attendants are waiting on Her. Some of them are wearing red dress; some\nblue dress, some yellow dress; thus the Deva girls, variously dressed were\nserving Her and standing by Her side. They were dancing, singing on and\nplaying with musical instruments and were gladly chanting hymns in praise of\nthe Devi. O Narada!We saw there another wonderful thing. Listen. We saw the\nwhole universe, moving and non-moving within the nails of the lotus feet of\nthe Devi. We saw there myself, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra, Vayu, Agni, Yama, Moon, Sun,\nVaru _n_ a, Tva _st_ a, Indra, Kuvera and other Devas, Apsaras, Gandarbhas,\nrivers, oceans, mountains, Visvavasus Chitraketu, Sveta, Chitrangada, Narada,\nTumburu, Ha Ha Hu Hu and other Gandarbhas, the twin As'vins, the eight Vasus,\nSadhyas, Siddhas, the Pitris, Ananta and other Nagas, Kinnaras, Uragas,\nRaksasas, the abode of Vaiku _nt_ ha, the abode of Brahma, Kailas'a mountain,\nthe best of all mountains; all were existing there. Within that nail of the\ntoe were, reflected all the things of the Universe. The lotus whence I was\nborn, the four faced Brahma like myself on that lotus, Bhagavan Jagannath\nlying on that bed of Ananta, the two Demons Madhu Kaitabha, all I saw there.\n\n\n\n21-31. Seeing all these wonderful things within the nails of Her lotus feet, I\nbecame greatly surprised and thought timidly :-- \xc2\x93What are all these!\xc2\x94 My\ncompanions Vi _sn_ u and S'ankara were struck with wonder. We three, then,\nmade out that She was our Mother of the universe.\n\n\n\nThus full one hundred years passed away in seeing the various glories of the\nDevi in the auspicious nectar-like Mani Dvipa; as long we were there, Her\nattendants, the Deva girls adorned with various ornaments gladly considered us\nas Sakhis. We, too, were greatly fascinated by their enchanting gestures and\npostures. For that reason, we saw always their beautiful movements with great\ngladness. Once, on an occasion, Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, while He was in that\nfeminine form, chanted hymns in praise of the great Devi S\xc2\x92ri Bhuvanes`vari.\n\n\n\np. 129\n\n\n\nS\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan said :-- Salutation to the Devi Prakriti, the Creatrix; I bow\ndown again and again to Thee. Thou art all-auspicious and grantest the desires\nof Thy devotees; Thou art of the nature of Siddhi (success) and Vriddhi\n(increase). I bow down again and again to Thee. I bow down to the World\nMother, Who is of the nature of Everlasting Existence, Intelligence and Bliss.\nO Devi! Thou createst, preservest and destroyest this Universe; Thou dost the\nPralaya (the great Dissolution) and showest favour to the created beings. Thus\nThou art the Authoress of the above five fold things that are done; so, O\nBhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, I bow down to Thee! Thou art the great efficient and material\ncause of the changeful. Thou art the Unchangeable, Immoveable Consciousness;\nThou art the half letter (Ardhamatra), Hrillekha (the consciousness that ever\npervades both inside and outside the Universe); Thou art the Supreme Soul and\nthe individual soul. Salutation again and again to Thee.\n\n\n\nO Mother! I now realise fully well that this whole Universe rests on Thee; it\nrises from Thee and again melts away in Thee. The creation of this Universe\nshews Thy infinite force. Verily, Thou art become Thyself all these Lokas\n(regions). During the time of creation Thou createst the two formless elements\nakasa and Vayu and the three elements with form, fire, water, and earth; then\nwith these Thou createst the whole Universe and shewest this to the Enjoyer\nPuru _s_ a, who is of the nature of consciousness, for His satisfaction. Thou\nagain dost become the material cause of the twentythree (23) Tattvas, Mahat,\netc., as enumerated in the Sankhya system and appearest to us like a mirage.\n\n\n\n32\\. O Mother! Were it not for Thee, no object would be visible, Thou\npervadest the whole Universe. It is for this reason that those persons that\nare wise declare that even the Highest Puru _s_ a can do no work without Thy\naid.\n\n\n\n33-34. O Devi! Thou createst and art giving satisfaction to the whole Universe\nby Thy power; again at the time of Pralaya Thou swallowest forcibly all these\nthat are seen. So, O Devi! Who can fathom Thy powers? O Mother! Thou didst\nsave us from the hands of Madhu and Kaitabha. Then Thou hast brought us to\nthis Mani Dvipa and shewed us Thy own form, all the extended regions and\nimmense powers and given us exquisite delight and joy. This is the highest\nplace of happiness.\n\n\n\n35-37. O Mother! When I Myself, S'ankara and Brahma or any one of us is unable\nto fathom Thy inconceivable glory, who else can then ascertain? O Bhavani! Who\nknows, how many more than the several regions that we saw reflected in thy\nnails of Thy feet, exist in Thy creation. O One endowed with infinitely great\npowers! O Devi! we saw another Vi _sn_ u, another Hara, another Brahma, all of\ngreat celebrity in the Universe exhibited by Thee; who knows how many other\nsuch Brahmas,\n\n\n\np. 130\n\n\n\netc., exist in Thy other Universes! Thy glory is infinite. O Mother! I bow\ndown again and again to Thy lotus feet and pray to Thee that may Thy this form\nexist always in my mind. May my mouth always utter Thy name and may my two\neyes see always Thy lotus feet.\n\n\n\n38-43. O Revered One! May I remember Thee as my Goddess and may'st Thou\nconstantly look on myself as Thy humble servant. O Mother! What more shall I\nsay than this :-- May this relation as mother and son always exist between\nThee and me. O World-Mother! There is nothing in this world that is not known\nto Thee for Thou art omniscient. So O Bhavani! What more shall my humble self\ndeclare to Thee! Now dost Thou do whatever Thou desirest. O Devi! The rumour\ngoes that Brahma is the Creator, Vi _sn_ u is the Preserver, and Mahes'vara is\nthe Destroyer! Is this true? O Eternal One! It is through Thy Will power,\nthrough Thy force, that we create, preserve and destroy. O Daughter of the\nHimalaya mountain! The earth is supporting this Universe; it is Thy endless\nmight that is holding all this made of five elements. O Grantress of boons! It\nis through Thy power and lustre that the Sun is lustrous and becomes visible.\nThough Thou art the attributeless Self, yet by Thy Mayic power Thou appearest\nin the form of this Prapancha Universe. When Brahma, Mahes'a, and I myself\ntake birth by Thy power and are not eternal, what more can be said of Indra\nand other Devas than this that they are mere temporary things and created. It\nis only Thou that art Eternal, Ancient Prakriti and the Mother of this\nUniverse. O Bhavani! Now I realise from my remaining with Thee, that it is\nThou that dost impart, out of mercy, the Brahma vidya to the ancient Puru _s_\na; and thus He can realise His eternal nature. Otherwise He will remain always\nunder delusion that He is the Lord, He is the Puru _s_ a without beginning,\nthat He is good and the Universal Soul, and thus suffers under various forms\nof egoism (Ahamkara).\n\n\n\nThou art the Vidya of the intelligent persons and the S\xc2\x92akti of the be\xc2\xadings\nendowed with force; Thou art Kirti (fame), Kanti (lustre), Kamala (wealth) and\nthe spotless Tu _st_ i (peace, happiness). Amongst men, Thou art the\ndispassion, leading to Mukti (complete freedom from bondage). Thou art the\nGayatri, the mother of the Vedas; and Thou art Svaha, Svadha, etc. Thou art\nthe Bhagavati, of the nature of the three Gu _n_ as; Thou art the half matra\n(half the upper stroke of a letter), the fourth state, transcending the Gu _n_\nas. It is Thou that givest always the S\xc2\x92astras for the preservation of the\nDevas and the Brahma _n_ as. It is Thou that hast expanded and manifested this\nwhole phenomenon of the visible Universe for the liberation of the embodied\nsouls (Jivas), the parts of the pure holy Brahma _n_ , the Full, the\nBeginningless, the Deathless, forming the waves of\n\n\n\np. 131\n\n\n\nthe lnfinite expanse of ocean. When the Jiva comes to know internally and\nbecomes thoroughly conscious that all this is Thy work, Thou createst and\ndestroyest, that all this is Thy Mayic pastime, false, like the parts of an\nactor in a theatrical play, then and then only he desists for ever from his\npart in this Theatre of world. O Mother! O Destroyer of the greatest\ndifficulties! I always take refuge unto Thee. Thou dost save me from this\nocean of Samsara, full of Moha (delusion). Let Thou be my Saviour when my end\nwill come, from these infinitely troublesome and unreal pains arising from\nlove and hatred. Obeisance to Thee! O Devi! O Maha vidya! I fall prostrate at\nThy feet. O Thou, the Giver of all desires! O Auspicious One! Dost Thou give\nthe knowledge that is All-Light to Me.\n\n\n\nThus ends the fourth chapter of the Third Skandha on the hymns to the Great\nDevi by Vi _sn_ u in the Mahapura _n_ a S'rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyas.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk03ch05.htm)\n\n"
