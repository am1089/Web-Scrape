Janamejaya said :-- How did the Goddess Lak _s_ mi, the daughter of the\nocean, come to be born as a mare, when cursed by the Bhagavan in His moment of\nanger, and what did Revanta do at that time? In what country was the Devi born\nas a mare and how did She pass Her time alone like one whose husband had gone\nabroad. O Muni! How long and in what forest unfrequented by persons did she\npass her time, thus deprived of the companion of her husband and what did she\ndo at that time? When was she reconciled with her husband Vasudeva? and how\ndid she get a son, when she lived in a state of separation from her husband. O\nbest of \xc3\x82ryas! I am very curious to hear this excellent story. So describe\nthis in full details to me.\n\n\n\n6\\. Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! Thus questioned by Janamejaya, the Dvaipayan\nMuni began to recite the story in its full details.\n\n\n\n7-24. Vyasa said :--O King! I will now describe to you the pleasing story of\nthe Pura _n_ as in a clear distinct language; hear. Revanta, the son of the\nSun, became terrified to see Vasudeva, the Deva of the Devas cursing the Lak\n_s_ mi Devi and, after bowing down to Janardan, the Lord of the world, went\noff. Seeing the anger of Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of the world, he went quickly to\nhis father and informed him of the curse delivered by Naraya _n_ a to the\nGoddess Lak _s_ mi. And the Lak _s_ mi Devi, the lotus-eyed, thus cursed, got\nthe permission of Naraya _n_ a and with a grieved heart bowed down to him and\ncame down to the world of mortals. She took the form of a mare and went to the\nspot where the wife of the Sun (named Chchaya) practised her asceticism in\nancient times. The place was the confluence of the river Kalindi and the\nTamasa, and decorated with lovely forests and trees situated north of the\nmountain named Supar _n_ ak _s_ a, yielding all desires. There she meditated\nwith her whole heart the auspicious Mahadeva S\xc2\x92ankara, the Giver of all\ndesires, thus :-- That Mahadeva is holding the Tris\xc2\x92ula (the trident) on his\narms; His forehead is adorned with beautiful cooling semi-Moon; He has five\nfaces, each face having three eyes; His throat is coloured blue; He has ten\narms; His body is white like camphor; He wears a tiger\xc2\x92s skin; His upper\ngarment is of elephant\xc2\x92s skin; and snakes are his holy thread; He is holding\nthe one-half of the body of Gauri and his neck is adorned with garlands of\nhuman skulls. The Goddess Lak _s_ mi, the daughter of the ocean, assuming the\nform of a mare, thus practised severe asceticism in that\n\n\n\np. 547\n\n\n\nplace of pilgrimage. O King! With a feeling of intense dispassion (Vairagyam)\ntowards the worldly things, She spent the divine one thousand years in the\nmeditation of Mahadeva, the God of the Gods. After that period, the Highest\nLord Mahadeva, mounting on His bull, came there with His consort Parvati and\nappeared before the Lak _s_ mi Devi, perceptible by his eyes. Appearing thus\nwith His host of His own persons, He then spoke to Lak _s_ mi, dear to Hari,\nnow practising ascetism in the form of a mare, \xc2\x93O Auspicious One! You are the\nMother of this whole Universe and your Husband is the Creator of these worlds\nand is capable to give all desires. Why are You, then, practising asceticism,\nwhen He is present? What is the cause of this? O Devi! Why are You praising\nhymns to me, instead of to Vasudeva S\xc2\x92ri Hari, Who is capable to yield\nenjoyments and final liberation, and Who is the Preserver and the Lord of this\nworld. O Devi! Work should be done according to the authority of the Vedas; it\nis stated in the Vedas that the husband is the lord of a woman; therefore it\nis never advisable to fix one\xc2\x92s mind entirely on another person. The eternal\nDharma of women is to serve their husbands; whether the husband be a saint or\na sinner, the woman, desirous of her welfare, should serve her husband in\nevery way. O Daughter of the Ocean! Your husband Naraya _n_ a is fit to be\nserved by all and He is capable to yield all desires. Why are you then\nworshipping Me, and leaving the Lord of the Goloka, the Deva of the Devas.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n25-32. Lak _s_ mi said :-- O Deva of the Devas! O Seat of Auspiciousness! I\nknow that You are soon pleased with Your servant. My husband has cursed me. O\nOcean of mercy! Kindly save me from this curse. O S\xc2\x92ambhu! When I informed my\nhusband of my mental agonies, graciously and mercifully He then pointed out\nhow I might be freed of this curse thus :-- \xc2\x93O Kamale! When Your son will be\nborn, then You will be freed of this curse and will, no doubt, come back and\nlive in this Heaven of Vaikuntha.\xc2\x94 Thus spoken, I have come in this hermitage\nto make tapas and to worship Thee, knowing that Thou art the Bhagavan, the\nLord of Bhavani, the Lord of all and the Giver of all desires. O Lord of the\nDevas! How can I get a son without the intercourse of My husband? Though I am\nguiltless, my husband has forsaken me and is living in Vaiku _nt_ ha. O\nMahes\xc2\x92vara! Thou art doing good to all persons; and if Thou art pleased with\nme, then grant me a boon. O Lord! I know full well that there is no\ndistinction between Him and Thee. O Lord of Girija! This truth I have come to\nlearn from my husband. O Hara! You are the same thing that He is and what is\nHe is the same as You; there is not the least doubt in this. O Thou, full of\nauspiciousness! Recognising the Sameness without any distinction between Him\nand Thee,\n\n\n\np. 548\n\n\n\nI am meditating on Thee. Had it been otherwise, then I would certainly have\nbeen guilty when I take Thy refuge and meditate on Thee.\n\n\n\n33-36. S\xc2\x92ankara said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi, the daughter of the Ocean! Tell truly before\nme how you have been able to realise the identity between Him and Me. The\nDevas, Munis and the Mahar _s_ is, versed in the Vedas, get their\nunderstandings baffled by wrong argumentations and never realise the identity\nwithout any difference between us. Almost everywhere you will perceive that\nmany of my devotees blame me. Specially in this Kali Yuga due to the influence\nof Time, this happens to a very great extent in many cases. O Auspicious One!\nLet that go! How have you come to know this matter, which is difficult even\nfor the liberal-minded persons to comprehend. Know that this perception of the\nidentity between me and Hari is very rare.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n37-38. Vyasa said :-- O King! When Mahadeva asked thus with great pleasure,\nthe Devi Kamala, the darling of Hari, gladly replied the essence of the matter\nto Mahadeva.\n\n\n\n39-43. Lak _s_ mi said :-- \xc2\x93O Deva of the Devas! One day Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u,\nseated in the Padmasana posture, was immersed in deep meditation. I was very\nmuch astonished at this. When His meditation was over and when He was in a\npleasant mood, I asked Him with great humility, O Deva of the Devas! I know\nthat You are the Lord of the world and Master of this whole Universe; when\nBrahma and the other Devas were united and churned the great ocean, I came out\nof the waters and looked all around to know who is the superior one whom I can\nselect as my husband and then, thinking You as the superior to all the Devas,\nI accepted You as my husband. Now whose meditation You are doing again? A\ngreat doubt has thus occurred in my mind. O Lord! You are my most Beloved; now\ndisclose to me your innermost desire and thought.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n44-49. Vi _sn_ u said :-- \xc2\x93O Beloved! Hear now, whom I am meditating. I am\nmeditating in the lotus of My heart that Mahadeva Mahes\xc2\x92vara, the Highest of\nall the Devas. Mahadeva, the Deva of the Devas, of indomitable prowess,\nsometimes meditates on Me and sometimes I meditate on the Lord of the Deva,\nS\xc2\x92ankara, the Destroyer of Tripura. I am dear to S\xc2\x92iva as his life is dear to\nhim and S\xc2\x92ankara is similarly dear to me. The hearts of us both are attached\nto each other in the most secret way possible; therefore there is not the\nleast difference betwixt us both. O large-eyed One! Those men who being my\ndevotees hate S\xc2\x92ankara, certainly go to hell. I speak this very truly unto\nyou.\xc2\x94 O Mahes\xc2\x92vara! When I asked him this question when he was all alone, that\nDeva of the Devas, the Highest Vi _sn_ u thus said to me. Therefore I am\nmeditating on You, knowing that You are His beloved. O Mahes\xc2\x92a! Now find out\nmeans by which I can mix with My husband.\n\n\n\np. 549\n\n\n\n50-59. Vyasa said :-- O King! Mahadeva, skilled in speech, hearing thus the\nwords of Lak _s_ mi, consoled Her with sweet words and said :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful!\nBe peaceful; I am pleased with Your tapasya; soon You will come in contact\nwith Your husband. There is not the least doubt in this. When I will send the\nBhagavan, the Lord of the world, He will come before you in the shape of a\nhorse, to satisfy your desires. I will send the Madhusudana, the Deva of the\nDevas, in such a manner, as he will come in the form of a horse, passionately\nattached to you. O One of good eye brows! Thus you will get a son equivalent\nto Naraya _n_ a; and the son will be the King on this earth and will be\nundoubtedly worshipped by all. O fortunate One! After you get your son, you\nwill go to Vaiku _nt_ ha with Naraya _n_ a and will reside there as His\nBeloved. Your son will be famed by the name of Ekavira; and from him will\npropagate the Haihaya dynasty on the earth. O Kamale! You were blind by\nprosperity, and, becoming passionate, you forgot the Devi Parames\xc2\x92vari,\nresiding in your heart. Therefore you have experienced such a result.\nTherefore, to expiate that sin, take Her refuge by all means. O Devi! If your\nheart remained attached to the Highest Devi the blissful Bhagavati, your heart\nwould never have got attached to the Uchchais\xc2\x92rava horse. Vyasa said :-- O\nKing! Thus granting boons to Lak _s_ mi Devi, He with his consort Uma vanished\naway in her presence.\n\n\n\n60-62. Kamala Devi, lovely in all respects, whose toe nails are always rubbed\nby the gems on the coronets of the Devas, began to meditate on the lotus-feet\nof Ambika and in expectation of his beloved Hari, in the shape of a horse,\npraised and chanted hymns frequently to the Highest Goddess, in words choked\nwith feelings of intense love.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighteenth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the origin of the\nHaihaya Dynasty in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 19](bk06ch19.htm)\n\n'
