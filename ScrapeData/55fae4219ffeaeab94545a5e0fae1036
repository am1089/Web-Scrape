[1](ry353.htm#fn_821)  \nThe spouses of the giant king  \nAround their lord were slumbering,  \nAnd, gay with sparkling earrings, shone  \nFair as the moon to look upon.  \nThere by her husband's side was seen  \nMandodarifavourite queen,  \nThe beauty of whose youthful face  \nBeamed a soft glory through the place.  \nThe Vanared the dame more fair  \nThan all the royal ladies there,  \nAnd thought, 'These rarest beauties speak  \nThe matchless dame I come to seek.  \nPeerless in grace and splendour, she  \nThe Maithil queen must surely be.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[401:1](ry352.htm#fr_820) Women, says Valmiki.
