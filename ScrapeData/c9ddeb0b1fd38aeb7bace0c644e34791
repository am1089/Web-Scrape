And in the state of perfect conciliation also (the Yogins apprehend the\nhighest Brahman), according to _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti.\n\nAt the time of perfect conciliation the Yogins see the unevolved Self free\nfrom all plurality. By 'perfect conciliation' we understand the presentation\nbefore the mind (of the highest Self), which is effected through meditation\nand devotion.--This is vouched for by _S_ ruti as well as\n\np. 172\n\n[paragraph continues] Sm _ri_ ti. So, e.g. Ka. Up. IV, 1, 'The Self-existent\npierced the openings of the senses so that they turn outward; therefore man\nlooks without, not within himself. Some wise man, however, with his eyes\nclosed and wishing for immortality, saw the Self within.' And Mu. Up. III, 1,\n8, 'When a man's mind has become purified by the serene light of knowledge\nthen he sees him, meditating on him as without parts.' Sm _ri_ ti-passages of\nthe same tendency are the following ones, 'He who is seen as light by the\nYogins meditating on him sleepless, with suspended breath, with contented\nminds, with subdued senses; reverence be to him 1!' and 'The Yogins see him,\nthe august, eternal one.'\n\nBut if in the state of perfect conciliation there is a being to be conciliated\nand a being conciliating, does not this Involve the distinction of a higher\nand a lower Self?--No, the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[172:1](sbe38127.htm#fr_119) Whose Self is Yoga.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 25](sbe38128.htm)\n\n"
