And (it is) objectionable on account of the contradictions.\n\nThe Sa _n_ khya-system, moreover, labours from many internal contradictions.--\nThe Sa _n_ khyas hold that while Prak _ri_ ti is for the sake of another and\nthe object of knowledge and fruition, the soul is independent, an enjoying and\nknowing agent, and conscious of Prak _ri_ ti; that the soul reaches isolation\nthrough the instrumentality of Prak _ri_ ti only, and that as its nature is\npure, permanent, unchanging consciousness, absence of all activity and\nisolation belong to that nature; that for this reason the accomplishing of the\nmeans of bondage and release and of release belong to Prak _ri_ ti only; and\nthat, owing to Prak _ri_ ti\'s proximity to the unchanging non-active soul,\nPrak _ri_ ti, by a process of mutual superimposition (adhyasa), works towards\nthe creation of a world and subserves the purposes of the soul\'s fruition and\nemancipation.--\'Since the aggregate of things is for the sake of another;\nsince there is an opposite of the three gu _n_ as and the rest; since there is\nsuperintendence; since there is an experiencing subject; and since there is\nactivity for the sake of isolation; the soul exists\' (Sa _n_ khya Ka. 17);\n\'And from that contrast the soul is proved to be a witness, isolated, neutral,\ncognising and inactive\' (18).--And after having stated that the activity of\nthe Pradhana is for the purpose of the release of the Self, the text says,\n\'therefore no (soul) is either bound or released, nor does it migrate; it is\nPrak _ri_ ti which, abiding in various beings, is bound and released and\nmigrates\' (62). And \'From this connexion therewith (i.e. with the soul) the\nnon-intelligent appears as intelligent; and although all agency belongs to the\ngu _n_ as, the indifferent (soul) becomes an agent. In order that the soul may\nknow the Pradhana and become isolated, the connexion of the two takes place\nlike that of the lame and the blind; and thence creation springs\' (20, 21).--\nNow to that which is eternally unchanging, non-active and isolated, the\nattributes of being a witness and an enjoying and cognising agent can in no\nway belong. Nor also can such a being be subject to error resting on\n\np. 493\n\nsuperimposition; for error and superimposition both are of the nature of\nchange. And, on the other hand, they also cannot belong to Prak _ri_ ti, since\nthey are attributes of intelligent beings. For by superimposition we\nunderstand the attribution, on the part of an intelligent being, of the\nqualities of one thing to another thing; and this is the doing of an\nintelligent being, and moreover a change. Nor is it possible that\nsuperimposition and the like should take place in the soul only if it is in\napproximation to Prak _ri_ ti.--They may take place just on account of the\nnon-changing nature of the soul!--Then, we reply, they would take place\npermanently. And that mere proximity has no effective power we have already\nshown under II, 1, 4. And if it is maintained that it is Prak _ri_ ti only\nthat migrates, is bound and released, how then can she be said to benefit the\nsoul, which is eternally released? That she does so the Sa _n_ khyas\ndistinctly assert, \'By manifold means Prak _ri_ ti, helpful and endowed with\nthe gu _n_ as, without any benefit to herself, accomplishes the purpose of the\nsoul, which is thankless and not composed of the gu _n_ as\' (Sa _n_ khya Ka.\n60).--The Sa _n_ khyas further teach that Prak _ri_ ti, on being seen by any\nsoul in her true nature, at once retires from that soul--\'As a dancer having\nexhibited herself on the stage withdraws from the soul, so Prak _ri_ ti\nwithdraws from the soul when she has manifested herself to it\' (59); \'My\nopinion is that there exists nothing more sensitive than Prak _ri_ ti, who\nknowing "I have been seen" does not again show itself to the soul\' (61). But\nthis doctrine also is inappropriate. For, as the soul is eternally released\nand above all change, it never sees Prak _ri_ ti, nor does it attribute to\nitself her qualities; and Prak _ri_ ti herself does not see herself since she\nis of non-intelligent nature; nor can she wrongly impute to herself the soul\'s\nseeing of itself as her own seeing of herself, for she herself is non-\nintelligent and the soul is incapable of that change which consists in seeing\nor knowing.--Let it then be said that the \'seeing\' means nothing more than the\nproximity of Prak _ri_ ti to the soul!--But this also does not help you; for,\nas said above, from that there would follow eternal seeing, since the two are\nin eternal\n\np. 494\n\nproximity. Moreover, the ever unchanging soul is not capable of an\napproximation which does not form an element of its unchanging nature.--\nMoreover, if you define the seeing as mere proximity and declare this to be\nthe cause of Release, we point out that it equally is the cause of bondage--so\nthat bondage and release would both be permanent.--Let it then be said that\nwhat causes bondage is wrong seeing--while intuition of the true nature of\nthings is the cause of Release!--But as both these kinds of seeing are nothing\nbut proximity, it would follow that both take place permanently. And if, on\nthe other hand, the proximity of Soul and Prak _ri_ ti were held not to be\npermanent, then the cause of such proximity would have to be assigned, and\nagain the cause of that, and so on _ad infinitum_.--Let us then, to escape\nfrom these difficulties, define proximity as nothing more than the true nature\nof soul and Prak _ri_ ti!--As the true nature is permanent, we reply, it would\nfollow therefrom that bondage and release would be alike permanent.--On\naccount of all these contradictory views the system of the Sa _n_ khyas is\nuntenable.\n\nWe finally remark that the arguments here set forth by us at the same time\nprove the untenableness of the view of those who teach that there is an\neternally unchanging Brahman whose nature is pure, non-differenced\nintelligence, and which by being conscious of Nescience experiences unreal\nbondage and release. For those philosophers can show no more than the Sa _n_\nkhyas do how their Brahman can be conscious of Nescience, can be subject to\nadhyasa, and so on. There is, however, the following difference between the\ntwo theories. The Sa _n_ khyas, in order to account for the definite\nindividual distribution of birth, death, and so on, assume a plurality of\nsouls. The Vedantins, on the other hand, do not allow even so much, and their\ndoctrine is thus all the more irrational. The assertion that there is a\ndifference (in favour of the Vedantins) between the two doctrines, in so far\nas the Vedantins hold Prak _ri_ ti to be something unreal, while the Sa _n_\nkhyas consider it to be real, is unfounded; for pure, homogeneous\nintelligence, eternally non-changing, cannot possibly be conscious of anything\n\np. 495\n\ndifferent from itself, whether it be unreal or real. And if that thing is held\nto be unreal, there arise further difficulties, owing to its having to be\nviewed as the object of knowledge, of refutation, and so on.\n\nHere terminates the adhikara _n_ a of \'the impossibility of construction.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10.
