Narada spoke :-- O Bhagavan! Thou art the Lord of this world; Thou canst\nshew favour and disfavour both; Thou art specially versed in the sixty-four\nKalas (arts of learning); Thou art the chief of the Yogis. I therefore ask\nThee to solve a doubt of mine. By what Pu _n_ yam a man can become free from\nall his sins and limitations and he can realise and become of the nature of\nBrahma. O Lord! And what are duly the Ri _s_ is, Chha _n_ das, Devatas, Dhyan,\nand Nyasa, etc., of this meritorious act? I want to hear.\n\n\n\n4-25. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! There is but one and the only one way to\nthis and though that is very secret, I will disclose that to you. It is the\nGayatri-Kavacha. It can destroy all sins. Therefore to recite or to hold it on\none's body enables the man to become free from all his sins and to get all his\ndesires fulfilled and he gets the Sayuya Mukti with the Devi (be merged in the\nDevi-Body). Now hear the Ri _s_ is, Chha _n_ das, etc., of this Kavacha :--\nBrahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'vara are the Ri _s_ is; the Rik, Yajus, Sama and\nAtharva Vedas are the Chha _n_ das; the Parama Kala Gayatri of the nature of\nBrahma is the Devata; \xc2\x93Tat\xc2\x94 in Gayatri is the Vija; \xc2\x93Bharga\xc2\x94 is the S\xc2\x92akti;\nand \xc2\x93Dhiyah\xc2\x94 is the Kilaka; and its viniyoga (application) is in getting the\nMok _s_ a (liberation.). With the first four syllables touch the heart; with\n\n\n\np. 1142\n\n\n\nthe next three letters touch the head; with the next four letters touch the\ntuft on the crown of the head; with the next three letters on the Kavacha;\nwith the next four letters on the eyes and with the last four letters make the\nNyasa, all over the body repeating \xc2\x93Astraya Pha _t_ ,\xc2\x94 O Narada! Hear now the\nDhyanam of Gayatri, that grants all desires. The Gayatri Devi has five faces;\none of which is of white colour; and the other four is of pearl, Vidruma,\ngolden, and Nilakantama _n_ i colour respectively. Each face has got three\neyes; on the head there is a crown of jewels and the digit of the Moon is\nshining there. Her body is composed of the twenty-four tattvas. She has ten\nhands :-- On the top right and left hands there are two lotuses; lower down,\nthere are disc and conch shell; lower down, there are rope and skull; lower\ndown, there are noose and goad; and on the bottom hands right and left she is\nmaking signs of \xc2\x93No fear\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93ready to grant boons.\xc2\x94 Thus meditating on S\xc2\x92ri\nGayatri, one is to recite the Kavacha thus :-- Let the Gayatri Devi protect my\nfront; Savitri Devi protect my right; the Sandhya Devi, my back and the Devi\nSarasvati, my left. Let my Mother Parvati Devi protect my quarters. Let\nJalas'ayini protect the southeast; Yatudhana Bhayankari protect my South-west;\nPavamanavilasini my north-west; Rudrarupi _n_ i Rudra _n_ i protect my north-\neast. Let Brahma _n_ i protect my top and Vai _sn_ avi protect my nether\nregions. Let the word \xc2\x93Tat\xc2\x94 in the Gayatri protect my legs; \xc2\x93Savitu _h_ \xc2\x94\nprotect my Knees; \xc2\x93Vare _n_ yam,\xc2\x94 protect my loins; \xc2\x93Bhargah,\xc2\x94 my navel. Let\n\xc2\x93Devasya\xc2\x94 protect my heart; \xc2\x93Dhimahi\xc2\x94 protect my neck; \xc2\x93Dhiyah,\xc2\x94 protect my\neyes; \xc2\x93Yah,\xc2\x94 protect my forehead; \xc2\x93Na _h_ \xc2\x94 protect my head; and \xc2\x93Prachodayat\xc2\x94\nprotect the tuft on the crown of my head.\n\n\n\nAgain let the \xc2\x93Tat\xc2\x94 of the twenty-four syllabled Gayatri protect my head;\n\xc2\x93Sa,\xc2\x94 protect my forehead; \xc2\x93Vi\xc2\x94 protect my eyes; \xc2\x93Tu\xc2\x94 my cheeks; \xc2\x93Va,\xc2\x94 protect\nmy nostrils; \xc2\x93Re,\xc2\x94 my mouth; \xc2\x93 _n_ i\xc2\x94 protect my upper lip; \xc2\x93Ya _h_ \xc2\x94 protect\nmy lower lip; \xc2\x93Bha\xc2\x94 within my face; \xc2\x93rgo,\xc2\x94 protect my cheeks; \xc2\x93De,\xc2\x94 my throat;\n\xc2\x93Va\xc2\x94 my shoulders; \xc2\x93Sya\xc2\x94 my right hand; \xc2\x93Dhi\xc2\x94 my navel; \xc2\x93ma,\xc2\x94 my heart, \xc2\x93Hi,\xc2\x94\nmy belly; \xc2\x93Dhi,\xc2\x94 my navel; \xc2\x93Yo\xc2\x94 my loins; \xc2\x93Yo\xc2\x94, my anus; \xc2\x93na _h_ ,\xc2\x94 my thighs,\n\xc2\x93Pra,\xc2\x94 my Knees; \xc2\x93Cho\xc2\x94 my shanks \xc2\x93Da\xc2\x94 my heels; \xc2\x93Ya\xc2\x94 my legs; and let \xc2\x93at\xc2\x94\nprotect all my sides. O Narada! This divine Kavacha of the Devi Gayatri can\nbaffle hundreds and thousands of obstructions and evils; can grant sixty-four\nKalas and liberation. By the glory of this Kavacha, man can become free from\nall evils and can attain the state of Brahma. Moreover whoever reads or hears\nthis acquires the fruits of making a gift of a thousand cows.\n\n\n\np. 1143\n\n\n\nHere ends the Third Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the description of the\nKavacha of S\xc2\x92ri Gayatri Devi in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam\nof 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4](bk12ch04.htm)\n\n"
