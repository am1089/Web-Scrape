Sana\xe1\xb9\xadkum\xc4\x81ra replied thus:\n\n"Hear, O Gau\xe1\xb9\xadama, that \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva as expounded by P\xc4\x81rva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab after inquiring into all\n\xe1\xb8\x8dharmas and ascertaining \xc5\x9aiva\'s opinion. This treatise on the nature of Hamsa\nwhich gives the fruit of bliss and salvation and which is like a treasure to\nthe yogin, is (a) very mystic (science) and should not be revealed (to the\npublic).\n\n"Now we shall explain the true nature of Hamsa and Paramahamsa for the benefit\nof a brahmach\xc4\x81rin (a seeker after Brahman or celibate), who has his desires\nunder control, is devoted to his guru and always contemplates (as) Hamsa, and\nrealises thus: It (Hamsa) is permeating all bodies like fire (or heat) in all\nkinds of wood or oil in all kinds of gingelly seeds. Having known (It) thus,\none does not meet with death.\n\n"Having contracted the anus (with the heels pressed against it), having raised\nthe v\xc4\x81yu (breath) from (M\xc5\xabla) 2 \xc4\x80dh\xc4\x81ra\n\np. 213\n\n[paragraph continues] (chakra), having made circuit thrice round\nSv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhishth\xc4\x81na, having gone to Ma\xe1\xb9\x87ip\xc5\xabraka, having crossed An\xc4\x81hata, having\ncontrolled Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a in Vi\xc5\x9bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi and then having reached \xc4\x80j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81, one contemplates in\nBrahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra (in the head), and having meditated there always \'I am of three\nm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s,\' cognises (his Self) and becomes formless. The \xc5\x9aisna 1 (penis) has two\nsides (left and right from head to foot). This is that Paramahamsa (Supreme\nHamsa or Higher Self) having the resplendence of crores of suns and by whom\nall this world is pervaded.\n\n"It (this Hamsa which has bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi as vehicle) 2 has eightfold v\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi. (When it\nis) in the eastern 3 petal, there is the inclination (in a person) to virtuous\nactions; in the south-eastern petal, there arise sleep, laziness, etc.; in the\nsouthern, there is the inclination to cruelty; in the south-western, there is\nthe inclination to sins; in the western, there is the inclination to sensual\nsport; in the north-western, there arise the desire of walking, and others; in\nthe northern, there arises the desire of lust; in the north-eastern, there\narises the desire of amassing money; in the middle (or the interspaces between\nthe petals), there is the indifference to material pleasures. In the filament\n(of the lotus), there arises the waking state; in the pericarp, there arises\nthe svapna (dreaming state); in the b\xc4\xabja (seed of pericarp), there arises the\nsushup\xe1\xb9\xadi (dreamless sleeping state); when leaving the lotus, there is the\n\xe1\xb9\xadurya (fourth state). When Hamsa is absorbed in N\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da (spiritual sound), the\nstate beyond the fourth is reached. N\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da (which is at the end of sound and\nbeyond speech and mind) is like a pure crystal extending from (M\xc5\xabla) \xc4\x80dh\xc4\x81ra to\nBrahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra. It is that which is spoken of as Brahma and Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.\n\n"(Here the performance of Ajap\xc4\x81 G\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab is given).\n\n"Now Hamsa is the \xe1\xb9\x9bshi; the metre is Avyak\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81 G\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab; Paramahamsa is the\n\xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81 (or presiding deity) \'Ham\' is the b\xc4\xabja; \'Sa\' is the \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab; So\'ham is\nthe k\xc4\xablaka. 4 Thus there are\n\np. 214\n\nsix. There are 21, 600 Hamsas (or breaths) 1 in a day and night. (Salutation 2\nto) Surya, Soma, Nira\xc3\xb1jana (the stainless) and Nir\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81sa (the universeless).\nAjap\xc4\x81 man\xe1\xb9\xadra. (May) the bodiless and subtle one guide 3 (or illuminate my\nunderstanding). Vaushat to Agni-Soma. Then A\xe1\xb9\x85gany\xc4\x81sas and Karany\xc4\x81sas occur (or\nshould be performed after the man\xe1\xb9\xadras as they are performed before the\nman\xe1\xb9\xadras) in the heart and other (seats). Having done so, one should\ncontemplate upon Hamsa as the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 in his heart. Agni and Soma are its wings\n(right and left sides); Omk\xc4\x81ra is its head; Uk\xc4\x81ra and bin\xe1\xb8\x8du are the three eyes\n4 and face respectively; Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra and Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab (or Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra\'s wife) are the feet\nkantha\xe1\xb9\xada (or the realisation of the oneness of j\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 or Hamsa, the lower\nself with Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 or Paramahamsa, the Higher Self) is done in two ways,\n(sampraj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xada 5 and asampraj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xada).\n\n"After that, Unman\xc4\xab 6 is the end of the Ajap\xc4\x81 (man\xe1\xb9\xadra). Having thus reflected\nupon manas by means of this (Hamsa), one hears N\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da after the uttering of this\njapa (man\xe1\xb9\xadra) a crore of times. It (N\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da) is (begun to be heard as) of ten\nkinds. The first is chini (like the sound of that word); the second is chini-\nchini; the third is the sound of bell; the fourth is that of conch; the fifth\nis that of \xe1\xb9\xadan\xe1\xb9\xadri (lute); the sixth is that sound of \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81la (cymbals); the\nseventh is that of flute; the eighth is that of bheri (drum); the ninth is\nthat of m\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\x85ga (double drum); and the tenth is that of clouds ( _viz_.,\nthunder). He may experience the tenth without the first nine sounds (through\nthe initiation of\n\np. 215\n\na guru). In the first stage, his body becomes chini-chini; in the second,\nthere is the (bha\xc3\xb1jana) breaking (or affecting) in the body; in the third,\nthere is the (bhe\xe1\xb8\x8dana) piercing; in the fourth, the head shakes; in the fifth,\nthe palate produces saliva; in the sixth, nectar is attained; in the seventh,\nthe knowledge of the hidden (things in the world) arises; in the eighth,\nPar\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81k is heard; in the ninth, the body becomes invisible and the pure divine\neye is developed; in the tenth, he attains Parabrahman in the presence of (or\nwith) \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 which is Brahman. After that, when manas is destroyed, when it\nwhich is the source of sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa and vikalpa disappears, owing to the\ndestruction of these two, and when virtues and sins are burnt away, then he\nshines as Sa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xc5\x9biva of the nature of \xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi pervading everywhere, being\neffulgence in its very essence, the immaculate, the eternal, the stainless and\nthe most quiescent Om. Thus is the teaching of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das; and thus is the\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[212:1](tmu27.htm#fr_168) This word "Hamsa" is very mysterious and has\nmanifold meanings according to different standpoints. It is composed of Ham\n(or Aham) and Sa (ha), which mean "I" (am) "that". In its highest sense, it is\nK\xc4\x81lahamsa (or Parabrahman). It is also Brahm\xc4\x81 when he has Hamsa (or swan) as\nthe vehicle or Hamsa-v\xc4\x81hana. When Hamsa which is the manifestation of Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a is\napplied to the human breath, we are said to exhale with Ha and to inhale with\nSa. It is also called Ajap\xc4\x81-G\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab.\n\n[212:2](tmu27.htm#fr_169) The different chakras of those that are above the\nanus, in the genitals, navel, heart, and throat, between the eyebrows and in\nthe head.\n\n[213:1](tmu27.htm#fr_170) This is omitted in the Calcutta edition and\nseemingly makes no sense here.\n\n[213:2](tmu27.htm#fr_171) This is how a commentator explains.\n\n[213:3](tmu27.htm#fr_172) This refers to the different petals in the heart.\n_Vide_ the same in N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da-Parivr\xc4\x81jaka and \xe1\xb8\x8chy\xc4\x81nabin\xe1\xb8\x8du Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds.\n\n[213:4](tmu27.htm#fr_173) K\xc4\xablaka means wedge. In the Ajap\xc4\x81 man\xe1\xb9\xadra \'Hamsa-\nso\'ham\', So\'ham is the wedge to which the whole man\xe1\xb9\xadra is fastened.\n\n[214:1](tmu27.htm#fr_174) One commentator gives the table for 21,600 thus: 60\nbreaths make one Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a; 6 Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, one n\xc4\x81di; and 60 n\xc4\x81dis, one day and night.\n\n[214:2](tmu27.htm#fr_175) The words are: S\xc5\xabry\xc4\x81ya, Som\xc4\x81ya, Nira\xc3\xb1jan\xc4\x81ya,\nNirabh\xc4\x81s\xc4\x81ya. It is with the pronunciation of these words that the different\nplaces in the body are touched, _viz_., A\xe1\xb9\x85gany\xc4\x81sas and Karany\xc4\x81sas are\nperformed. The first word is pointed to the heart with the thumb; the second,\nto the head, and the third, to the hair of the head. With the last, a kavacha\n(armour) is made by circling the fingers round the head and then circling one\nhand over another. This process is carried on again after the pronunciation of\nAjap\xc4\x81 man\xe1\xb9\xadra which follows. Here Soma (moon) is that which is united with Thai\nor the emblem of the union of the lower and higher Selves. S\xc5\xabrya or Sun is the\ncauser of the state of one-ness.\n\n[214:3](tmu27.htm#fr_176) As it stands, it means "the bodiless, the subtle and\nthe guide." The original is A\xe1\xb9\xadanu Sukshmam Pracho\xe1\xb8\x8day\xc4\x81t.\n\n[214:4](tmu27.htm#fr_177) The three eyes are the two eyes commonly now in use\nwith the Divine eye.\n\n[214:5](tmu27.htm#fr_178) Contemplation with an object as seed and the\nseedless one.\n\n[214:6](tmu27.htm#fr_179) A state above manas or when manas is transcended.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 26.
