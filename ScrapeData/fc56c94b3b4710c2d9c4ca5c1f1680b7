Here is my\nmistress. She is gazing at a picture and is talking with Madanik\xc4\x81. I will go\nto her. [ _She walks about. Then enter Vasantasen \xc4\x81, as described, and\nMadanik\xc4\x81_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Madanik\xc4\x81 girl, is this portrait really like Ch\xc4\x81rudatta?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Very like.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. How do you know?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Because my mistress\xc2\x92 eyes are fastened so lovingly upon it.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Madanik\xc4\x81 girl, do you say this because courtezan courtesy\ndemands it?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. But mistress, is the courtesy of a girl who lives in a\ncourtezan\'s house, necessarily false?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Girl, courtezans meet so many kinds of men that they do learn\na false courtesy.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. But when the eyes of my mistress find such delight in a thing,\nand her heart too, what need is there to ask the reason?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But I should not like to have my friends laugh at me.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. You need not be afraid. Women understand women.\n\n_Maid_. [ _Approaching_.] Mistress, your mother sends word that a covered cart\nis waiting at the side-door, and that you are to take a drive.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Tell me, is it Ch\xc4\x81rudatta who invites me?\n\n_Maid_. Mistress, the man who sent ornaments worth ten thousand gold pieces\nwith the cart\xc2\x97\n\np. 58\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Is who?\n\n_Maid_. Is the king\'s brother-in-law, Sansth\xc4\x81naka.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Indignantly_.] Go! and never come again on such an errand.\n\n_Maid_. Do not be angry, mistress. I was only sent with the message.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But it is the message which makes me angry.\n\n_Maid_. But what shall I tell your mother?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Tell my mother never to send me another such message, unless\nshe wishes to kill me.\n\n_Maid_. As you will. [ _Exit_.]\n\n[ _Enter Sharvilaka_.]\n\n_Sharv_. Blame for my sin I laid upon the night;\n\n  I conquered sleep and watchmen of the king;  \nBut darkness wanes, and in the sun\'s clear light  \n  My light is like the moon\'s\xc2\x97a faded thing.1\n\nAnd again:\n\nWhoever cast at me a passing look,  \n  Or neared me, anxious, as they quickly ran,  \nAll such my laden soul for foes mistook;  \n  For sin it was wherein man\'s fear began.2\n\nWell, it was for Madanik\xc4\x81\'s sake that I did the deed of sin.\n\nI paid no heed to any one who talked with serving-men;  \n  The houses ruled by women-folk\xc2\x97these I avoided most;  \nAnd when policemen seemed to have me almost in their ken,  \n  I stood stock-still and acted just exactly like a post.  \nA hundred such man\xc2\x9cuvres did I constantly essay,  \nAnd by such means succeeded in turning night to day.3\n\n[ _He walks about_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Girl, lay this picture on my sofa and come back at once with a\nfan.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Yes, mistress.\n\n[ _Exit with the picture_.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. This is Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s house. I will enter. [ _He does so_.]\n\np. 59\n\nI wonder where I can find Madanik\xc4\x81. [ _Enter Madanik \xc4\x81 with the fan.\nSharvilaka discovers her_.] Ah, it is Madanik\xc4\x81.\n\nSurpassing Madana 1 himself in charm,  \n  She seems the bride of Love, in human guise;  \nEven while my heart the flames of passion harm,  \n  She brings a sandal 2 coolness to my eyes.4\n\nMadanik\xc4\x81!\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Discovers Sharvilaka_.] Oh, oh, oh, Sharvilaka! I am so glad,\nSharvilaka. Where have you been?\n\n_Sharvilaka_. I will tell you. [ _They gaze at each other passionately_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. How Madanik\xc4\x81 lingers! I wonder where she is. [ _She looks\nthrough a bull\'s-eye window_.] Why, there she stands, talking with a man. Her\nloving glance does not waver, and she gazes as if she would drink him in. I\nimagine he must be the man who wishes to make her free. Well, let her stay,\nlet her stay. Never interrupt anybody\'s happiness. I will not call her.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Tell me, Sharvilaka. [ _Sharvilaka looks about him uneasily_.]\nWhat is it, Sharvilaka? You seem uneasy.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. I will tell you a secret. Are we alone?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Of course we are.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. What! a deep secret? I will not listen.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Tell me, Madanik\xc4\x81. Will Vasantasen\xc4\x81 take a price for your\nfreedom?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. The conversation has to do with me? Then I will hide behind\nthis window and listen.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. I asked my mistress about it, Sharvilaka, and she said that if\nshe could have her way, she would free all her servants for nothing. But\nSharvilaka, where did you find such a fortune that you can think of buying my\nfreedom from my mistress?\n\n_Sharvilaka_. A victim to my pauper plight,\n\n  And your sweet love to win, p. 60  \nFor you, my timid maid, last night  \n  I did the deed of sin.5\n\nVasantasen\xc4\x81. His face is tranquil. It would be troubled, if he had sinned.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Oh, Sharvilaka! For a mere nothing\xc2\x97for a woman\xc2\x97you have risked\nboth things!\n\n_Sharvilaka_. What things?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Your life and your character.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. My foolish girl, fortune favors the brave.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Oh, Sharvilaka! Your character was without a stain. You didn\'t do\nanything very bad, did you, when for my sake you did the deed of sin?\n\n_Sharv_. The gems that magnify a woman\'s charm,\n\nAs flowers the creeping plant, I do not harm.  \nI do not rob the Brahman of his pelf,  \nNor seize the sacrificial gold myself.  \nI do not steal the baby from the nurse,  \nSimply because I need to fill my purse.  \nEven as a thief, I strive with main and might  \nFor just distinction \'twixt the wrong and right.6\n\nAnd so you may tell Vasantasen\xc4\x81 this:\n\nThese ornaments were made for you to don,  \n  Or so it seems to me;  \nBut as you love me, never put them on  \n  Where other folks may see.7\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. But Sharvilaka, ornaments that nobody may see, and a\ncourtezan\xc2\x97the two things do not hang together. Give me the jewels. I want to\nsee them.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Here they are. [ _He gives them to her with some uneasiness_.]\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Examining the jewels_.] It seems to me I have seen these\nbefore. Tell me. Where did you get them?\n\np. 61\n\n_Sharvilaka_. What does that matter to you, Madanik\xc4\x81? Take them.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Angrily_.] If you can\'t trust me, why do you wish to buy my\nfreedom?\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Well, this morning I heard in the merchants\xc2\x92 quarter that the\nmerchant Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\xc2\x97\n\n[ _Vasantasen \xc4\x81 and Madanik\xc4\x81 swoon_.]\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Madanik\xc4\x81! Come to yourself! Why is it that now\n\nYour figure seems to melt in limp despair,  \nYour eyes are wildly rolling here and there?  \nThat when I come, sweet girl, to make you free,  \nYou fall to trembling, not to pitying me?8\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Coming to herself_.] O you reckless man! When you did what you\nought not to have done for my sake, you didn\'t kill anybody or hurt anybody in\nthat house?\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Madanik\xc4\x81, Sharvilaka does not strike a terrified man or a man\nasleep. I did not kill anybody nor hurt anybody.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Really?\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Really.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Recovering consciousness_.] Ah, I breathe again.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Thank heaven!\n\n_Sharvilaka_. [ _Jealously_.] What does this "Thank heaven" mean, Madanik\xc4\x81?\n\nI sinned for you, when love had made me pine,  \n  Although my house was good since time began;  \nLove took my virtue, but my pride is mine.  \n  You call me friend and love another man?9\n\n[ _Meaningly_.]\n\nA noble youth is like a goodly tree;  \n  His wealth, the fruit so fair;  \nThe courtezan is like a bird; for she  \n  Pecks him and leaves him bare.10\n\nLove is a fire, whose flame is lust,  \n  Whose fuel is gallantry, p. 62  \nWherein our youth and riches must  \n  Thus sacrificed be.11\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [With a smile.] His excitement is a little out of place.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Yes!\n\nThose men are fools, it seems to me,  \n  Who trust to women or to gold;  \nFor gold and girls, \xc2\x92tis plain to see,  \n  Are false as virgin snakes and cold.12\n\nLove not a woman; if you ever do,  \n  She mocks at you, and plays the gay deceiver:  \nYet if she loves you, you may love her too;  \n  But if she doesn\'t, leave her.13\n\nToo true it is that\n\nA courtezan will laugh and cry for gold;  \nShe trusts you not, but waits your trustful hour.  \nIf virtue and a name are yours, then hold!  \nAvoid her as you would a graveyard flower.14\n\nAnd again:\n\nAs fickle as the billows of the sea,  \n  Glowing no longer than the evening sky,  \nA woman takes your gold, then leaves you free;  \n  You\'re worthless, like cosmetics, when you\'re dry.15\n\nYes, women are indeed fickle.\n\nOne man perhaps may hold her heart in trust,  \n  She lures another with coquettish eyes,  \nSports with another in unseemly lust,  \n  Another yet her body satisfies.16\n\nAs some one has well said:\n\nOn mountain-tops no lotuses are grown;  \n  The horse\'s yoke no ass will ever bear;  \nRice never springs from seeds of barley sown;  \n  A courtezan is not an honest fair.17\n\np. 63\n\nAccursed Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, you shall not live! [ _He takes a few steps_.]\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Seizing the hem of his garment_.] O you foolish man! Your\nanger is so ridiculous.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Ridiculous? how so?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Because these jewels belong to my mistress.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. And what then?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. And she left them with that gentleman.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. What for?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Whispers_.] That\'s why.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. [ _Sheepishly_.] Confound it!\n\nThe sun was hot one summer day;  \nI sought the shadow, there to stay:  \nPoor fool! the kindly branch to pay,  \nI stole its sheltering leaves away.18\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. How sorry he seems. Surely, he did this thing in ignorance.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. What is to be done now, Madanik\xc4\x81?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Your own wit should tell you that.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. No. For you must remember,\n\nNature herself gives women wit;  \nMen learn from books a little bit.19\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Sharvilaka, if you will take my advice, restore the jewels to\nthat righteous man.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. But Madanik\xc4\x81, what if he should prosecute me?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. No cruel heat comes from the moon.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Good, Madanik\xc4\x81, good!\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Madanik\xc4\x81,\n\nFor what I did, I feel no grief nor fear;  \n  Why tell me of this good man\'s virtues high?  \nShame for my baseness touches me more near;  \n  What can this king do to such rogues as I?20\n\np. 64\n\nNevertheless, your suggestion is inconsistent with prudence. You must discover\nsome other plan.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Yes, there is another plan.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. I wonder what it will be.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Pretend to be a servant of that gentleman, and give the jewels to\nmy mistress.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. And what then?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Then you are no thief, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta has discharged his obligation,\nand my mistress has her jewels.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. But isn\'t this course too reckless?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. I tell you, give them to her. Any other course is too reckless.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Good, Madanik\xc4\x81, good! Spoken like a free woman.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Risen at last is wisdom\'s light,\n\n  Because I followed after you;  \nWhen clouds obscure the moon by night,  \n  \xc2\x92Tis hard to find a guide so true.21\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Then you must wait here a moment in K\xc4\x81ma\'s shrine, while I tell\nmy mistress that you have come.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. I will.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Approaches Vasantasen \xc4\x81_.] Mistress, a Brahman has come from\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta to see you.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But girl, how do you know that he comes from Ch\xc4\x81rudatta?\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Should I not know my own, mistress?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Shaking her head and smiling. Aside_.] Splendid! [\n_Aloud_.] Bid him enter.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. Yes, mistress. [ _Approaching Sharvilaka_.] Enter, Sharvilaka.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. [ _Approaches. With some embarrassment_.] My greetings to you.\n\np. 65\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. I salute you, sir. Pray be seated.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. The merchant sends this message: "My house is so old that it is\nhard to keep this casket safe. Pray take it back." [ _He gives it to Madanik\n\xc4\x81, and starts to leave_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Sir, will you undertake a return commission of mine?\n\n_Sharvilaka_. [ _Aside_.] Who will carry it? [ _Aloud_.] And this commission\nis\xc2\x97\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. You will be good enough to accept Madanik\xc4\x81.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Madam, I do not quite understand.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. But I do.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. How so?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta told me that I was to give Madanik\xc4\x81 to the man who\nshould return these jewels. You are therefore to understand that he makes you\na present of her.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. [ _Aside_.] Ah, she sees through me. [ _Aloud_.] Good,\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta, good!\n\nOn virtue only set your heart\'s desire;  \nThe righteous poor attain to heights whereto  \nThe wicked wealthy never may aspire.22\n\nAnd again:\n\nOn virtue let the human heart be set;  \nTo virtue nothing serves as check or let.  \nThe moon, attaining unattainable, is led  \nBy virtue to her seat on Shiva\'s head.23\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Is my driver there? [ _Enter a servant with a bullock-cart_.]\n\n_Servant_. Mistress, the cart is ready.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Madanik\xc4\x81 girl, you must show me a happy face. You are free.\nEnter the bullock-cart. But do not forget me.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Weeping_.] My mistress drives me away. [ _She falls at her\nfeet_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. You are now the one to whom honor should be\n\np. 66\n\npaid. 1 Go then, enter the cart. But do not forget me.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Heaven bless you! and you, Madanik\xc4\x81,\n\nTurn upon her a happy face,  \nAnd hail with bended head the grace  \nThat gives you now the name of wife,  \nAs a veil to keep you safe through life.24\n\n[ _He enters the bullock-cart with Madanik \xc4\x81, and starts away_.]\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. Men! Men! We have the following orders from the\nchief of police: "A soothsayer has declared that a young herdsman named Aryaka\nis to become king. Trusting to this prophecy, and alarmed thereat, King P\xc4\x81laka\nhas taken him from his hamlet, and thrown him into strict confinement.\nTherefore be watchful, and every man at his post."\n\n_Sharvilaka_. [ _Listening_.] What! King P\xc4\x81laka has imprisoned my good friend\nAryaka? And here I am, a married man. Confound it! But no,\n\nTwo things alone\xc2\x97his friend, his wife  \n  Deserve man\'s love below;  \nA hundred brides may forfeit life  \n  Ere he should suffer so.25\n\nGood! I will get out. [ _He does so_.]\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Folding her hands. Tearfully_.] My lord, if you must, at least\nbring me first to your parents.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Yes, my love, I will. I had the same thought in mind. [ _To the\nservant_.] My good fellow, do you know the house of the merchant Rebhila?\n\n_Servant_. Certainly.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Bring my wife thither.\n\n_Servant_. Yes, sir.\n\n_Madanik \xc4\x81_. If you desire it, dear. But dear, you must be very careful.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\np. 67\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Now as for me,\n\nI\'ll rouse my kin, the kitchen cabinet,  \n  Those high in fame by strength of good right arm,  \nAnd those who with the king\'s contempt have met,  \n  And royal slaves, to save my friend from harm:  \n          Like old Yaugandhar\xc4\x81yana  \n          For the good king Udayana.26\n\nAnd again:\n\nMy friend has causeless been confined  \nBy wicked foes of timid kind;  \nI fly, I fly to free him soon,  \nLike the eclipse-oppressed moon.27\n\n[ _Exit_.]\n\nMaid. [ _Entering_.] Mistress, I congratulate you. A Brahman has come with a\nmessage from Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Ah, this is a joyful day. Show him every mark of respect,\ngirl, and have him conducted hither by one of the pages.\n\n_Maid_. Yes, mistress.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n[ _Enter Maitreya with a page_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Well! R\xc4\x81vana, the king of the demons, travels with his chariot\nthat they call the "Blossom." He earned it by his penances. Now I am a\nBrahman, and though I never performed any penances, I travel with another sort\nof a blossom\xc2\x97a woman of the town.\n\n_Maid_. Sir, will you inspect our gateway.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Gazes admiringly_.] It has just been sprinkled and cleaned and\nreceived a coat of green. The threshold of it is pretty as a picture with the\nofferings of all sorts of fragrant flowers. It stretches up its head as if it\nwanted to peep into the sky. It is adorned with strings of jasmine garlands\nthat hang down and toss about like the trunk of the heavenly elephant. It\nshines with its high ivory portal. It is lovely with any number of holiday\nbanners that gleam red as great rubies and wave their coquettish fingers as\n\np. 68\n\nthey flutter in the breeze and seem to invite me to enter. Both sides are\ndecorated with holiday water-jars of crystal, which are charming with their\nbright-green mango twigs, and are set at the foot of the pillars that sustain\nthe portal. The doors are of gold, thickly set with diamonds as hard to pierce\nas a giant\'s breast. It actually wearies a poor devil\'s envy. Yes,\nVasantasen\xc4\x81\'s house-door is a beautiful thing. Really, it forcibly challenges\nthe attention of a man who doesn\'t care about such things.\n\n_Maid_. Come, sir, and enter the first court.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Enters and looks about_.] Well! Here in the first court are\nrows of balconies brilliant as the moon, or as sea-shells, or as lotus-stalks;\nwhitened by handfuls of powder strewn over them; gleaming with golden\nstairways inlaid with all sorts of gems: they seem to gaze down on Ujjayin\xc4\xab\nwith their round faces, the crystal windows, from which strings of pearls are\ndangling. The porter sits there and snoozes as comfortably as a professor. The\ncrows which they tempt with rice-gruel and curdled milk will not eat the\noffering, because they can\'t distinguish it from the mortar. Show me the way,\nmadam.\n\n_Maid_. Come, sir, and enter the second court.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Enters and looks about_.] Well! Here in the second court the\ncart-bullocks are tied. They grow fat on mouthfuls of grass and pulse-stalks\nwhich are brought them, right and left, by everybody. Their horns are smeared\nwith oil. And here is another, a buffalo, snorting like a gentleman insulted.\nAnd here is a ram 1 having his neck rubbed, like a prize-fighter after the\nfight. And here are others, horses having their manes put in shape. And here\nin a stall is another, a monkey, tied fast like a thief. [ _He looks in\nanother direction_.] And here is an elephant, taking from his drivers a cake\nof rice and drippings and oil. Show me the way, madam.\n\n_Maid_. Come, sir, and enter the third court.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Enters and looks about_.] Well! Here in the third court\n\np. 69\n\nare these seats, prepared for young gentlemen to sit on. A half-read book is\nlying on the gaming-table. And the table itself has its own dice, made out of\ngems. And here, again, are courtezans and old hangers-on at court, past\nmasters in the war and peace of love, wandering about and holding in their\nfingers pictures painted in many colors. Show me the way, madam.\n\n_Maid_. Come, sir, and enter the fourth court.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Enters and looks about_.] Well! Here in the fourth court the\ndrums that maiden fingers beat are booming like the thunder; the cymbals are\nfalling, as the stars fall from heaven when their merit is exhausted; 1 the\npipe is discoursing music as sweet as the humming of bees. And here, again, is\na lute that somebody is holding on his lap like a girl who is excited by\njealousy and love, and he is stroking it with his fingers. And here, again,\nare courtezan girls that sing as charmingly as honey-drunken bees, and they\nare made to dance and recite a drama with love in it. And water-coolers are\nhanging in the windows so as to catch the breeze. Show me the way, madam.\n\n_Maid_. Come, sir, and enter the fifth court.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Enters and looks about_.] Well! Here in the fifth court the\noverpowering smell of asafetida and oil is attractive enough to make a poor\ndevil\'s mouth water. The kitchen is kept hot all the time, and the gusts of\nsteam, laden with all sorts of good smells, seem like sighs issuing from its\nmouth-like doors. The smell of the preparation of all kinds of foods and\nsauces makes me smack my lips. And here, again, is a butcher\'s boy washing a\nmess of chitterlings as if it were an old loin-cloth. The cook is preparing\nevery kind of food. Sweetmeats are being constructed, cakes are being baked. [\n_To himself_.] I wonder if I am to get a chance to wash my feet and an\ninvitation to eat what I can hold. [ _He looks in another direction_.] There\nare courtezans and bastard pages,\n\np. 70\n\nadorned with any number of jewels, just like Gandharvas 1 and Apsarases. 2\nReally, this house is heaven. Tell me, who are you bastards anyway?\n\nPages. Why, we are bastard pages\xc2\x97\n\nPetted in a stranger\'s court,  \n  Fed on stranger\'s food,  \nStranger\'s money makes us sport\xc2\x97  \n  Not so very good.  \nStranger women gave us birth,  \n  Stranger men begot;  \nBaby elephants in mirth,  \n  We\'re a bastard lot.28\n\n_Maitreya_. Show me the way, madam.\n\n_Maid_. Come, sir, and enter the sixth court.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Enters and looks about_.] Well! Here in the sixth court they\nare working in gold and jewels. The arches set with sapphires look as if they\nwere the home of the rainbow. The jewelers are testing the lapis lazuli, the\npearls, the corals, the topazes, the sapphires, the cat\'s-eyes, the rubies,\nthe emeralds, and all the other kinds of gems. Rubies are being set in gold.\nGolden ornaments are being fashioned. Pearls are being strung on a red cord.\nPieces of lapis lazuli are being cleverly polished. Shells are being pierced.\nCorals are being ground. Wet bundles of saffron are being dried. Musk is being\nmoistened. Sandalwood is being ground to make sandal-water. Perfumes are being\ncompounded. Betel-leaves and camphor are being given to courtezans and their\nlovers. Coquettish glances are being exchanged. Laughter is going on. Wine is\nbeing drunk incessantly with sounds of glee. Here are men-servants, here are\nmaid-servants, and here are men who forget child and wife and money. When the\ncourtezans, who have drunk the wine from the liquor jars, give them the\nmitten, they\xc2\x97drink. Show me the way, madam.\n\np. 71\n\n_Maid_. Come, sir, and enter the seventh court.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Enters and looks about_.] Well! Here in the seventh court the\nmated doves are sitting comfortably in their snug dovecotes, billing and\ncooing and nothing else, and perfectly happy. And there is a parrot in a cage,\nchanting like a Brahman with a bellyful of curdled milk and rice. And here,\nagain, is a talking thrush, chattering like a housemaid who spreads herself\nbecause somebody noticed her. A cuckoo, her throat still happy from tasting\nall sorts of fruit-syrups, is cooing like a procuress. Rows of cages are\nhanging from pegs. Quails are being egged on to fight. Partridges are being\nmade to talk. Caged pigeons are being provoked. A tame peacock that looks as\nif he was adorned with all sorts of gems is dancing happily about, and as he\nflaps his wings, he seems to be fanning the roof which is distressed by the\nrays of the sun. [ _He looks in another direction_.] Here are pairs of\nflamingos like moonbeams rolled into a ball, that wander about after pretty\ngirls, as if they wanted to learn how to walk gracefully. And here, again, are\ntame cranes, walking around like ancient eunuchs. Well, well! This courtezan\nkeeps a regular menagerie of birds. Really, the courtezan\'s house seems to me\nlike Indra\'s heaven. Show me the way, madam.\n\n_Maid_. Come, sir, and enter the eighth court.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Enters and looks about_.] Madam, who is this in the silk cloak,\nadorned with such astonishingly tautologous ornaments, who wanders about,\nstumbling and stretching his limbs?\n\n_Maid_. Sir, this is my mistress\xc2\x92 brother.\n\n_Maitreya_. What sort of ascetic exercises does a man have to perform, in\norder to be born as Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s brother? But no,\n\nHe may be shiny, may be greasy,  \n  And perfumed may he be.  \nAnd yet I warn you to go easy;  \n  He\'s a graveyard champak-tree.29\n\np. 72\n\n[ _He looks in another direction_.] But madam, who is that in the expansive\ngarment, sitting on the throne? She has shoes on her greasy feet.\n\n_Maid_. Sir, that is my mistress\' mother.\n\n_Maitreya_. Lord! What an extensive belly the dirty old witch has got! I\nsuppose they couldn\'t put that superb portal on the house till after they had\nbrought the idol in?\n\n_Maid_. Rascal! You must not make fun of our mother so. She is pining away\nunder a quartan ague.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Bursts out laughing_.] O thou blessed quartan ague! Look thou\nupon a Brahman, even upon me, with this thy favor!\n\n_Maid_. Rascal! May death strike you.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Bursts out laughing_.] Why, wench, a pot-belly like that is\nbetter dead.\n\nDrinking brandy, rum, and wine,  \n  Mother fell extremely ill.  \nIf mother now should peak and pine,  \n  A jackal-pack would have its fill.30\n\nWell, I have seen Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s palace with its many incidents and its eight\ncourts, and really, it seems as if I had seen the triple heaven in a nut-\nshell. I haven\'t the eloquence to praise it. Is this the house of a courtezan,\nor a piece of Kubera\'s 1 palace? Where\'s your mistress?\n\n_Maid_. She is here in the orchard. Enter, sir.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Enters and looks about_.] Well! What a beautiful orchard! There\nare any number of trees planted here, and they are covered with the most\nwonderful flowers. Silken swings are hung under the thick-set trees, just big\nenough for a girl to sit in. The golden jasmine, the sheph\xc4\x81lik\xc4\x81, the white\njasmine, the jessamine, the navamallik\xc4\x81, the amaranth, the spring creeper, and\nall the other flowers have fallen of themselves, and really, it makes Indra\'s\nheaven\n\np. 73\n\nlook dingy. [ _He looks in another direction_.] And the pond here looks like\nthe morning twilight, for the lilies and red lotuses are as splendid as the\nrising sun. And again:\n\nThe ashoka-tree, whose twigs so merry  \n  And crimson flowers have just appeared,  \nSeems like a battling mercenary,  \n  With clotting crimson gore besmeared.31\n\nGood! Now where\'s your mistress?\n\n_Maid_. If you would stop star-gazing, sir, you would see her.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Perceives Vasantasen \xc4\x81 and approaches_.] Heaven bless you!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Speaking in Sanskrit_. 1] Ah, Maitreya! [ _Rising_.] You\nare very welcome. Here is a seat. Pray be seated.\n\n_Maitreya_. When you are seated, madam. [ _They both seat themselves_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Is the merchant\'s son well?\n\n_Maitreya_. Well, madam.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Tell me, good Maitreya,\n\nDo friends, like birds, yet seek a shelter free  \nBeneath the modest boughs of this fair tree,  \nWhose leaves are virtues, confidence its root,  \nIts blossoms honor, good its precious fruit?32\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aside_.] A good description by a naughty woman. [ _Aloud_.]\nThey do, indeed.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Tell me, what is the purpose of your coming?\n\n_Maitreya_. Listen, madam. The excellent Ch\xc4\x81rudatta folds his hands 2 and\nrequests\xc2\x97\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Folding her hands_.] And commands\xc2\x97\n\n_Maitreya_. He says he imagined that that golden casket was his own and\ngambled it away. And nobody knows where the gambling-master\n\np. 74\n\nhas gone, for he is employed in the king\'s business.\n\n_Maid_. Mistress, I congratulate you. The gentleman has turned gambler.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Aside_.] It was stolen by a thief, and he is so proud that\nhe says he gambled it away. I love him for that.\n\n_Maitreya_. He requests that you will therefore be good enough to accept in\nits place this necklace of pearls.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Aside_.] Shall I show him the jewels? [ _Reflecting_.] No,\nnot yet.\n\n_Maitreya_. Why don\'t you take this necklace?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Laughs and looks at her friend_.] Why should I not take the\nnecklace, Maitreya? [ _She takes it and lays it away. Aside_.] How is it\npossible that drops of honey fall from the mango-tree, even after its blossoms\nare gone? [ _Aloud_.] Sir, pray tell the worthy gambler Ch\xc4\x81rudatta in my name\nthat I shall pay him a visit this evening.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aside_.] What else does she expect to get out of a visit to our\nhouse? [ _Aloud_.] Madam, I will tell him\xc2\x97[ _aside_ ] to have nothing more to\ndo with this courtezan.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Take these jewels, girl. Let us go and bring cheer to\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\n_Maid_. But mistress, see! An untimely storm is gathering.\n\n_Vasant_. The clouds may come, the rain may fall forever,\n\n  The night may blacken in the sky above;  \nFor this I care not, nor I will not waver;  \n  My heart is journeying to him I love.33\n\nTake the necklace, girl, and come quickly.\n\n[ _Exeunt omnes_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[59:1](lcc10.htm#fr_49) A name of K\xc4\x81ma, the god of love.\n\n[59:2](lcc10.htm#fr_50) Used as a refrigerant.\n\n[66:1](lcc10.htm#fr_51) That is to say, You are now a legal wife, while I am\nstill a courtezan.\n\n[68:1](lcc10.htm#fr_52) "Rams in India are commonly trained to fight."
