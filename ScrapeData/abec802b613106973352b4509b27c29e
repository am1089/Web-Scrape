When he has first seen the new moon, he sips water, and holding (a pot of)\nwater (in his hands) he worships (the moon) with the four (verses), 'Increase'\n(Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 4, 32), 'May thy milk' (ibid. IV, 2, 7, 4), 'New and new\nagain (the moon) becomes, being born' (ibid. II, 4, 14, 1), 'That Soma which\nthe \xc3\x82dityas make swell' (ibid. II, 4, 14, 1).\n\np. 180\n\n2. 2 When he has yawned, he murmurs, '(May) will and insight (dwell) in me.'\n\n3. 3 If the skirt (of his garment) is blown upon him (by the wind), he murmurs, 'A skirt art thou. Thou art not a thunderbolt. Adoration be to thee. Do no haft to me.'\n\n4\\. He should tear off a thread (from that skirt) and should blow it away with\nhis mouth.\n\n5. 5 If a bird has befouled him with its excrements, he murmurs, 'The birds that timidly fly together with the destroyers, shall pour out on me happy, blissful splendour and vigour.'\n\nThen let him wipe off that (dirt) with something else than his hand, and let\nhim wash himself with water.\n\n6. 6 'From the sky, from the wide air a drop of water has fallen down on me, bringing luck. With my senses, with my mind I have united myself, protected by the prayer that is brought forth by the righteous ones'\xc2\x97this (verse) he should murmur, if a drop of water unexpectedly falls down on him.\n\n7. 7 'If a fruit has fallen down from the top of a tree, or from the air, it is Vayu (who has made it fall). Where it has touched our bodies or the garment, (there) may the waters drive away destruction'\xc2\x97this (verse) he should murmur, if a fruit unexpectedly falls down on him.\n\n8. 8 'Adoration to him who dwells at the cross-roads,\n\np. 181\n\nwhose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells at the cross-\nroads!'\xc2\x97this (formula) he murmurs when he comes to a cross-road;\n\n9\\. 'Adoration to him who dwells among cattle, whose arrow is the wind, to\nRudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells among cattle!'\xc2\x97thus at a dung-heap;\n\n10\\. 'Adoration to him who dwells among the serpents, whose arrow is the wind,\nto Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells among the serpents!'\xc2\x97thus at a place\nthat is frequented by serpents.\n\n11\\. 'Adoration to him who dwells in the air, whose arrow is the wind, to\nRudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells in the air!'\xc2\x97this (formula) let him\nmurmur, if overtaken by a tornado.\n\n12\\. 'Adoration to him who dwells in the waters, whose arrow is the wind, to\nRudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells in the waters!'\xc2\x97this (formula) he murmurs\nwhen plunging into a river which is full of water.\n\n13\\. 'Adoration to him who dwells there, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra!\nAdoration to Rudra who dwells there!'\xc2\x97this (formula) he murmurs when\napproaching a beautiful place, a sacrificial site, or a big tree.\n\n14. 14 If the sun rises whilst he is sleeping, he shall fast that day and shall stand silent during that day;\n\n15\\. The same during the night, if the sun sets whilst he sleeps.\n\n16. 16 Let him not touch a sacrificial post. By\n\np. 182\n\ntouching it, he would bring upon himself (the guilt of) whatever faults have\nbeen committed at that sacrifice. If he touches one (sacrificial post), he\nshould say, 'This is thy wind;' if two (posts), 'These are thy two winds;' if\nmany (posts), 'These are thy winds.'\n\n17. 17 'The voices that are heard after us (?) and around us, the praise that is heard, and the voices of the birds, the deer's running (?) athwart: that we fear (?) from our enemies'\xc2\x97this (verse) he murmurs when setting out on a road.\n\n18. 18 'Like an Udgat _ri_ , O bird, thou singest the Saman; like a Brahman's son thou recitest thy hymn, when the Soma is pressed.\n\n'A blessing on us, O bird; bring us luck and be kind towards us!'\xc2\x97(This\nMantra) he murmurs against an inauspicious bird;\n\n19. 19 'If thou raisest thy divine voice, entering upon living beings, drive away our enemies by thy voice. O death, lead them to death!'\xc2\x97(thus) against a solitary jackal.\n\n20\\. Then he throws before the (jackal, as it were), a fire-brand that burns\nat both ends, towards that region (in which the jackal's voice is heard), with\n(the words), 'Fire! Speak to the fire! Death! Speak to the death!' Then he\ntouches water,\n\np. 183\n\n21\\. And worships (the jackal) with the Anuvaka, 'Thou art mighty, thou\ncarriest away' (Taitt. Sa _m_ hita I, 3, 3).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[179:7](sbe30058.htm#fr_588) Probably we should write a _g_ itakshi.\n\n[179:8](sbe30058.htm#fr_589) Mat _ri_ datta says, prativadinam abhi _g_ apaty\neva.\n\n[179:16](sbe30059.htm#fr_590) This chapter contains different Praya _s_ _k_\nittas.\n\n[180:2](sbe30059.htm#fr_591) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya.

In the last Pada bhayamasi is corrupt; the meaning seems to\nbe, 'that we (avert from ourselves and) turn it to our enemies.'
