This deity of wanderers and invaders was already of\ngreat antiquity and wide distribution; his attributes were in accord with the\nhabits and ideals of his worshippers; they multiplied with the discoveries of\nman and were ever influenced by the conditions prevailing in new areas of\nlocalization. He Was the Thunderer who brought rain to quicken dried-up\n\np. 2\n\npasture lands; he was the god of fertility, and he became the corn spirit; he\nwas "the friend of man"; he was the artisan of the Universe which he shaped\nwith his hammer, the dragon slayer, the giant killer, the slaughterer of\nenemies, the god of war. His racial significance must ever remain obscure. We\ncannot identify his original home, or even fix with certainty the\narchaeological period in which he first took definite shape. It is possible\nthat he may have been invoked and propitiated by Neolithic, or even by\nPalaeolithic, flint knappers who struck fire from stone long ere they\nsuspected the existence of metal; the primitive hunting and pastoral wanderers\nmay have conceived of a thunder deity engaged in splintering the hills with\nhis stone hammer, and fighting demons in the rude manner in which they\nthemselves contended against beasts of prey. Memories of the Stone Age cling\nto the hammer god. Indra\'s bolt was "the all-dreaded thunder-stone" of\nShakespeare\'s lyric; until recently Palaeolithic and Neolithic artifacts were\nreputed to be "elf bolts" and "thunder bolts" which fell from the sky; in\nScandinavian folklore "the flint hills" are the fragments of the weapon\nwielded by the thunder giant Hrungner. The bolt or hammer ultimately became an\naxe; and according to the modern Greeks, lightning flashes are caused by the\nblows of the "sky axe" (astropeleki); Scottish Gaelic retains an immemorial\nreference to the "thunder ball" (peleir-tarnainaich).\n\nThe hammer god\'s close association with hilly countries suggests that he was\nfirst worshipped on the steppes and then distributed by the nomads whose\nmigrations were propelled by changing climatic conditions. He is found as far\neast as China, where, as P\'an Ku, the dwarfish "first man", he smites primeval\nrocks with his thunder hammer while engaged in the work of shaping the hills;\n\np. 3\n\nhe is found as far west as Scotland, where, as the hunting giant Finn-mac-\nCoul, "in height sixty feet", he strikes with his hammer, "Ord na Feinne",\nsuch mighty blows on his shield that he is heard by his followers in Lochlann\n(Scandinavia). From ancient Egypt come distant echoes of the world artisan\nPtah, now a dwarf and anon a giant, who hammers out the copper sky, suggesting\nthe presence in Memphis of early Asian settlers at the very dawn of history.\nIn southern Europe the deity is Zeus-pater (Jupiter), the sublime wielder of\nthe thunderbolt; in northern Europe he is lusty Thor, hurling Mjolner through\nthe air against Jotuns, or cleaving valleys with it in the mountain range\nwhich he mistook for the giant Skrymer. We find the hammer god as Tarku among\nthe Hittites; he is Indra in Mitanni as in the Punjab; he is Rammon, or Adad,\nwho is carried aloft in triumph by the soldiers of Assur-banipal, the Assyrian\nEmperor; he is remembered in Palestine by the wail of Naaman, who cried: "When\nmy master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on\nmy hand, and I how myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in\nthe house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing . . ." 1 The\nthunder god is also known in Babylon, which received many of its settlers from\nthe hills of Elam and where Kassites, associated with Aryans, established a\ndynasty after successful invasion, prior to the discovery of the Punjab. The\nauthorities are agreed that Aryan culture shows traces of Babylonian\ninfluence; it does not follow, however, that Indra is of Babylonian origin.\n\nBut although his name, which has been deciphered as "In-da-ra" at Boghaz-Koi\nin Asia Minor, may belong to the early Iranian period, the Vedic "King of the\ngods"\n\np. 4\n\nassumed a distinctly Indian character after localization in the land of the\n"Five Rivers"; he ultimately stepped from his chariot, drawn by the steeds of\nthe Aryan horse tamers, and mounted an elephant; his Heaven, called Swarga,\nwhich is situated on the summit of Mount Meru, eclipses Olympus and Valhal by\nreason of its dazzling Oriental splendour; his combats are reflections of the\nnatural phenomena of Hindustan.\n\nWhen the hot Indian summer draws to a close, the whole land is parched and\nathirst for rain; rivers are low and many hill streams have dried up; man and\nbeast are weary and await release in the breathless enervating atmosphere;\nthey are even threatened by famine. Then dense masses of cloud gather in the\nsky; the tempest bellows, lightnings flash and thunder peals angrily and loud;\nrain descends in a deluge; once again torrents pour down from the hills and\nrivers become swollen and turgid. Indra has waged his battle with the Drought\nDemons, broken down their fortress walls, and released the imprisoned cow-\nclouds which give nourishment to his human "friends"; the withered pastures\nbecome green with generous and rapid growth, and the rice harvest follows.\n\nAccording to Vedic myth, Indra achieved his first great victory immediately\nafter birth. Vritra, "the encompasser", the Demon of Drought, was holding\ncaptive in his mountain fortress the cloud-cattle which he had harried in the\napproved manner of the Aryan raiders. 1 Mankind entreated the aid of the gods,\n"the shining ones, the world guardians":\n\nWho will take pity? Who will bring refreshment?  \nWho will come nigh to help us in distress?\n\n\n\n[![INDRA<br> <i>From the Indra Temple, Ellora</i>](tn/00400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/00400.jpg)  \nINDRA  \n_From the Indra Temple, Ellora_  \n\n\n\np. 5\n\nCounsels the thoughts within our hearts are counselling,  \nWishes are wished and soar towards the highest--  \nO none but them, the shining ones, are merciful,  \nMy longing wings itself towards the Eternals.\n\nIndra arose heroically to do battle for the sacrificers. Impulsively he seized\nthe nectar of the gods, called Soma, and drank a deep draught of that\nintoxicating juice. Then he snatched up his thunderstone which had been\nfashioned by the divine artisan Twashtri, who resembles the Germanic Mimer,\nthe "wonder smith". His "favourite bays", named the Bold and the Brown, were\nyoked in his golden chariot by his attendants and followers, the youthful\nMaruts.\n\nNow, at the very beginning, Indra, the golden child, became the king of the\nthree worlds. He it was who gave the air of life; he gave strength also. All\nthe shining gods revered him and obeyed his commands. "His shadow is\nimmortality; his shadow is death."\n\nThe Maruts, the sons of red Rudra, were the spirits of tempest and thunder. To\neach of their chariots were yoked two spotted deer and one swift-footed,\nnever-wearying red deer as leader. They were stalwart and courageous youths,\n"full of terrible designs like to giants"; on their heads were golden helmets\nand they had golden breastplates, and wore bright skins on their shoulders;\ntheir ankles and arms were decked with golden bracelets. The Maruts were\nalways strongly armed with bows and arrows and axes, and especially with\ngleaming spears. All beings feared those "cloud shakers" when they hastened\nforth with their lightning spears which "shattered cattle like the\nthunderstone"; they were wont to cleave cloud-rocks and drench the earth with\nquickening showers.\n\nWhen Indra drove forth to attack the Drought\n\np. 6\n\n[paragraph continues] Demon, the "hastening Maruts" followed him, shouting\nwith loud voices: in "a shower" were the Maruts "let loose"; they dashed\ntowards the imprisoned cows of the clouds and "chased them aloft".\n\nThe dragon Vritra roared when Indra drew nigh; whereat heaven shook and the\ngods retreated. Mother Earth, the goddess Prithivi (prit\xc2\xb4hi-vee), was troubled\nregarding her golden son. But Indra advanced boldly with the roaring Maruts;\nhe was inspired by the hymns of the priests; he had drunken deeply of Soma; he\nwas strengthened by the sacrifices offered on earth\'s altars; and he wielded\nthe thunderstone.\n\nThe Drought Demon deemed itself invulnerable, but Indra cast his weapon and\nsoon discovered the vulnerable parts of its writhing body. He slew the\nmonster; it lay prone before him; the torrents burst forth and carried it away\nto the sea of eternal darkness. Then Indra rejoiced and cried out:\n\nI have slain Vritra, O ye hast\'ning Maruts;  \nI have grown mighty through my own great vigour;  \nI am the hurler of the bolt of Thunder  \nFor man flow freely now the gleaming waters.\n\nOn earth the worshippers of the god were made glad; the Rishi hymned his\npraises:\n\nI will extol the manly deeds of Indra:  \nThe first was when the Thunder stone he wielded  \nAnd smote the Dragon; he released the waters,  \nHe oped the channels of the breasted mountains.\n\nHe smote the dragon Vritra in its fortress--  \nTwashtri had shaped for him the thunder weapon--  \nThen rushing freely like to bellowing cattle  \nThe gladsome waters to the sea descended, p. 7\n\nBull-spirited did Indra choose the Soma,  \nHe drank its juices from the triple ladles;  \nThen clutched the Bounteous One his thunder weapon,  \nAnd fiercely smote the first-born of the Dragons.\n\nThe smitten monster fell amidst the torrents,  \nThat pause nor stay, for ever surging onward;  \nThen Vritra covered by the joyful billows  \nWas carried to the darksome deeps of Ocean.  \n                                           \\-- _Rigveda_ , i. 32.\n\nA post-Vedic version of the encounter between Indra and the demon Vritra is\ngiven in the "Vana Parva" section of _Mah \xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata_. Although it is coloured\nby the change which, in the process of time, passed over the religious beliefs\nof the Aryans, it retains some features of the original myth which are absent\nin the Vedic hymns. It should be understood that, at the period referred to,\nthe belief obtained that the gods derived their powers from the saintly\nRishis, 1 who fed them with sacrifices and underwent terrible penances, which\nenabled them to support or destroy the Universe at will.\n\nIt is related that in the Krita Age (the first Age of the Universe) a host of\nD\xc4\x81n\xc4\x81vas (giants and demons) were so strongly armed that they were invincible\nin battle. They selected the dragon Vritra as their leader, and waged war\nagainst the gods, whom they scattered in all directions.\n\nRealizing that they could not regain their power until they accomplished the\ndeath of Vritra, the Celestials appeared before their Grandsire, the Supreme\nBeing, Brahma the incarnation of the Soul of the Universe. Brahma instructed\nthem to obtain the bones of a Rishi named Dadhicha, from which to construct a\ndemon-slaying weapon So the gods visited the Rishi and bowed\n\np. 8\n\ndown before him, and begged the boon according to Brahma\'s advice.\n\nSaid Dadhicha: "O ye gods, I will renounce my body for your benefit."\n\nThen the Rishi gave up his life, and from his bones the artisan god, Twashtri,\nshaped Indra\'s great weapon, which is called Vajra. 1\n\nTwashtri spake to Indra and said: "With this, the best of weapons, O exalted\none, reduce that fierce foe of the gods to ashes! And, having slain the foe,\nrule thou happily the entire domain of heaven, O chief of the celestials, with\nthose that follow thee." 2\n\nThen Indra led the gods against the mighty host. They found that Vritra was\nsurrounded by dreaded Danavas, who resembled mountain peaks. A terrible\nconflict was waged, but once again the gods were put to flight. Then Indra saw\nVritra growing bolder, and he became dejected. But the Supreme Being protected\nhim and the gods endowed him with their strength, so that he became mightier\nthan before. Thereupon Vritra was enraged, and roared loudly and fiercely, so\nthat the heavens shook and the earth trembled with fear. Deeply agitated,\nIndra flung his divine weapon, which slew the leader of the Danavas. But\nIndra, thinking the demon was still alive, fled from the field in terror to\nseek shelter in a lake. The Celestials, however, perceived that Vritra had\nbeen slain, and they rejoiced greatly and shouted the praises of Indra. Then,\nrallying once more, the gods attacked the panic-stricken Danavas, who turned\nand fled to the depths of ocean. There in the fathomless darkness\n\np. 9\n\nthey assembled together, and began to plot how they would accomplish the\ndestruction of the three worlds. 1\n\nAt length the dread conspirators resolved to destroy all the Rishis who were\npossessed of knowledge and ascetic virtue, because the world was supported by\nthem. So they made the ocean their abode, raising billows high as hills for\ntheir protection, and they began to issue forth from their fortress to make\nattacks on the mighty saints.\n\nIn the Babylonian Story of Creation the female dragon Tiawath (Tiamat), whose\nname signifies "the sea", 1 desired to possess the world, and plotted against\nthe gods with her horde of giant serpents, "raging dogs, scorpion men, fish\nmen, and other terrible beings". The gods then selected Belus (Bel-Merodach)\nas their leader, and proclaimed him their king. He slew Tiawath and covered\nthe heavens with one part of her body, and fashioned the earth with the other\nhalf. Then he set the moon and the stars in the sky, and afterwards created\nman: "he divided the darkness, separated the heavens from the earth, and\nreduced the universe to order". 2 The sun was the offspring of the moon.\n\nThe Indian Vedic and Epic dragon-slaying stories have evidently no connection,\nhowever, with a lost Creation myth. It is possible that they are part of the\nfloating material from which Babylonian mythology was framed. At the same time\nBabylonian influences may not have been absent in the post-Vedic Age. Indra\nbears points of resemblance to Bel-Merodach, but he is not a Creator in the\nsublime sense; he is rather an artisan god like the Chinese P\'an Ku, the\nlonely hammerman, and\n\np. 10\n\nthe Egyptian Ptah, who acquired a potter\'s wheel, in addition to his hammer,\nin the Nile valley.\n\nIndra fashioned the universe in the simple manner that the early Aryans built\ntheir wooden houses. 1 How he obtained the requisite material puzzled the\nVedic poets. It may be that there was a World Tree, however, like the great\nash Ygdrasil of Teutonic mythology. After measuring space with the sun, Indra\nset up four corner posts and constructed the world walls; the roof was the\ncloud-thatched sky. The wide doors of the world opened to the east, and every\nmorning they were opened to admit the sun, which Indra flung at evening into\nthe darkness as a Neolithic man may have flung out a house torch. These doors\nare the "gates", celebrated in the Vedic hymns, through which the gods entered\nto partake of the sacrifices and libations. Indra, who is called "an\naccomplished artisan", is lauded as the god who "firmly secured the dominion\nof air in the frame of heaven and earth". In another hymn it is told: "Indra\nmeasured six broad spaces, from which no existing thing is excluded: he it is\nwho made the wide expanse of earth and the lofty dome of the sky, even he".\n(V. i, 47. 3, 4.)\n\nIn the work of shaping the universe Indra is assisted by the shadowy deities\nSavitri, who merged with Surya, the sun god, Brihaspati, "Lord of Prayer", who\nmerged with Agni, god of fire, and Vishnu, god of grace. He was also aided by\nthe Ribhus, the artisans of the gods, who dwelt in the region of mid-air.\nTheir number is given variously as three or the multiples of three; they were\nthe sons of Sudhanvan, who was apparently identical with Indra, because "Indra\nis a Ribhu when he confers gifts"; indeed, the artisans are referred to as the\nchildren of the Thunder god. They make grass\n\n\n\n[![INTERIOR OF A TEMPLE TO VISHNU \\(BRINDABAN\\)](tn/01000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/01000.jpg)  \nINTERIOR OF A TEMPLE TO VISHNU (BRINDABAN)  \n\n\n\np. 11\n\nand herbs, and also channels for streams. In some respects they resemble the\nearth-gnomes, the Khnumu, "the modellers", the helpers of the Egyptian artisan\ngod Ptah, who shaped the world. "Countless little figures of these gods are\nfound in Egyptian tombs; for even as once the Khnumu had helped in the making\nof the world, so would they help to reconstruct in all its members the body of\nthe dead man in whose tomb they were laid." 1 The Ribhus similarly renovated\naged and decrepit parents; "they reunited the old cow to the calf"; they are\nalso credited with having shaped the heavens and the earth, 2and with having\nfashioned the "cow of plenty", and also a man named Vibhvan. 3\n\nAccording to the _Oxford Dictionary_ , they are "the three genii of the\nseasons in Hindu mythology". The Sanskrit word "Ribhu" is sometimes compared\nwith the Germanic word "Elf". Professor Macdonell considers it "likely that\nthe Ribhus were originally terrestrial or aerial elves" 4 They are evidently\nof common origin with the Teutonic elfin artisans who are associated with\nThor, the Germanic Indra.\n\nThe mother of the Ribhus was Saranyu, daughter of Twashtri, "the Hindu\nVulcan", the "master workman". Twashtri forms the organism in maternal wombs\nand supports the races of man. 5 As we have seen, he was the fashioner of\nIndra\'s thunderbolt: similarly the Teutonic elfin artisan Sindre makes Thor\'s\nhammer. 6\n\nThe two groups of Teutonic wonder-smiths were rivals; so were the Ribhus and\nTwashtri. The elfin artisans prove their skill in both cases by producing\n\np. 12\n\nwonderful gifts for the gods. Loke acts as a mischief, making spy in Germanic\nmyth, and Dadyak in Indian, and both lose their heads for wagers, but save\nthem by cunning.\n\nThe Ribhus had provided the Celestials with horses and chariots, but Twashtri\nfashioned a wonderful bowl which filled itself with Soma for the gods. In the\ncontest that ensued the Ribhus transformed the bowl into four cups. "This\nbowl", says Professor Macdonell, "perhaps represents the moon, the four cups\nbeing its phases." One of the Ribhus was a famous archer, like the elfin\nartisan Egil of Teutonic mythology.\n\nThe artisan of Babylonian mythology is Ea, father of Bel-Merodach. He is "King\nof the abyss, creator of everything, lord of all". He was the god of artisans\nin general, and is identified with the sea-deity of the Persian Gulf--half-\nfish, half-man--who landed "during the day to teach the inhabitants the\nbuilding of houses and temples, the gathering of fruits, and also geometry,\nlaw and letters". His pupils included "potters, blacksmiths, sailors,\nstonecutters, gardeners, farmers, &c." 1\n\nThe Ribhus and Twashtri were the artisans of nature, the spirits of growth,\nthe genii of the seasons, the elves of earth and air. Indra\'s close\nassociation with them emphasizes his character as a god of fertility, who\nbrought the quickening rain, and as the corn god, and the rice god. He was the\nson of Father Heaven and Mother Earth, two vague deities who were never\ncompletely individualized, but were never forgotten. Heaven was the sky-god\nDyaus-pita (from div = to shine), the Zeus pater of the Greeks, Jupiter of the\nRomans, and Tivi 2 (later,\n\np. 13\n\n[paragraph continues] Odin) of the Germanic peoples, whose wife was the earth-\ngoddess Jord, mother of Thor. The Hindu earth-mother (Terra mater) was\nPrithivi. Dyaus is sometimes referred to as a ruddy bull, whose bellowing is\nthe thunder; as the Night heaven he is depicted as a black steed decked with\npearls which are the stars; in one of the Vedic hymns reference is made to his\n"thunder-stone". Prithivi, who is sometimes symbolized as a cow, is the source\nof all vegetation, the supporter of earth, the female principle. She never\nassumes the importance of the Assyrian Ishtar, or the north Egyptian "earth-\nmother" Neith, or the "earth-mothers" of Europe. The Vedic Aryans were Great\nFather worshippers rather than Great Mother worshippers: their female deities\nwere Night, Dawn, Earth, and the Rivers, but they were not sharply\nindividualized until late; they are vague in the Vedas.\n\nAs the Greek Cronus (Roman Saturn) slew his father Ur\xc4\x83nus (Heaven), so did\nIndra slay his father Dyaus (Heaven). His earth-mother addresses him, saying:\n"Who has made thy mother a widow? Who has sought to slay the sleeping and the\nwaking? What deity has been more gracious than thou, since thou hast slain thy\nfather, having seized him by the foot?" 1\n\nThe Indian father-slaying myth appears to be connected with the doctrine of\nreincarnation. In the _Laws of Manu_ it is stated that "the husband, after\nconception by his wife, becomes an embryo and is born again of her; for that\nis the wifehood of a wife, that he is born again by her". 2 In the famous\nstory of Shakunt\xc4\x83l\xc4\x81, the husband is similarly referred to as the son of his\nwife, the son being a reincarnation of the father. 3 This belief\n\np. 14\n\nresembles the Egyptian conception which is summed up in the phrase "husband of\nhis mother". 1\n\nAt the barley harvest in spring and the rice harvest in autumn offerings were\nmade to the gods. A sacrificial cake of the new barley or rice was offered to\nIndra and Agni, a mess of old grain boiled and mixed with milk and water was\ngiven to the other gods, and a cake was also offered to Father Heaven and\nMother Earth in which clarified butter was an important ingredient; or the\noffering might consist entirely of butter, because "clarified butter is\nmanifestly the sap of these two, Heaven and Earth; . . . he (the offerer)\ntherefore gladdens these two with their own sap or essence".\n\nThe reason for this harvest offering is explained as follows: The gods and the\ndemons contended for supremacy. It chanced that the demons defiled, partly by\nmagic and partly by poison, the plants used by men and beasts, hoping thus to\novercome the gods. Men ceased to eat and the beasts stopped grazing; all\ncreatures were about to perish because of the famine.\n\nSaid the gods: "Let us rid the plants of this."\n\nThen they offered sacrifices and "accomplished all that they wanted to\naccomplish, and so did the Rishis".\n\nA dispute then arose among the gods as to who should partake of the offerings\nof the firstfruits--that is, of the new plants which replaced those the demons\nhad poisoned. It was decided to run a race to settle the matter. Indra and\nAgni won the race and were therefore awarded the cake. These two gods were\ndivine Kshatriyas (noblemen), the others were "common people". Whatever\nKshatriyas conquer, the commoners are permitted to share; therefore the other\ngods received the mess of old grain.\n\np. 15\n\nAfter the magic spell was removed from the plants by the gods, men ate food\nand cattle grazed once again. Ever afterwards, at the beginning of each\nharvest, the first fruits were offered up to Indra and Agni. The fee of the\npriest was the first-born calf "for that is, as it were, the firstfruits of\nthe cattle". 1\n\nThe popular Thunder god of the Vedic period bears a close resemblance to the\nhard-drinking, kindly, and impulsive Thor, the Teutonic god of few words and\nmighty deeds, the constant "friend of man" and the inveterate enemy of demons.\nIn the hymns Indra is pictured as a burly man, with "handsome, prominent\nnose", "good lips", and "comely chin"; he is "long-necked, big-bellied,\nstrongly armed", and has a weakness for ornaments. He is much addicted to\ndrinking "sweet, intoxicating Soma"; he "fills his stomach"; he quaffs "thirty\nbowls" at a single draught ere he hastens to combat against "hostile air\ndemons". Sometimes he is placed in a difficulty when two tribes of his\nworshippers are in conflict: both cry to him for victory, but\n\nThe god giveth victory unto him  \nWho with generous heart pours out  \nThe draught he thirsts for  \nNor feels regret in giving;  \nIndra joins with him upon the battlefield.  \n                                 _Rigveda_ , iv, 24. 2-6.\n\nThe Aryans, who were as notorious cattle lifters as the Gauls and the Scottish\nHighlanders, were wont to invoke the god ere they set out on a raid, chanting\nwith loud voices:\n\nIndra, whose riches are boundless, O grant us  \n  Thousands of beautiful cows and horses: p. 16  \nDestroy, thou mighty one, all who despise us,  \n  Visit with death all those who would harm us, and  \nIndra, whose riches are boundless, O grant us,  \n  Thousands of beautiful cows and horses.  \n                                       _Wilson\'s translation_.\n\nIn other hymns the Thor-like character of Indra, the war god, is naively\ndepicted. A sceptic is supposed to say: "Many men declare that there is no\nIndra. Who ever saw him? Why should we adore him?"\n\nThe god makes answer: "O singer, _I am_ : behold me! I am here now, and I am\ngreater than any living being. I delight in the performance of holy rites. I\nam also the Destroyer; I can hurl creation to ruin." _Rigveda_ , viii, 89.\n\nI never knew a man to speak so to me,  \nWhen all his enemies are safely conquered;  \nYea, when they see how fierce the battle rages,  \nThey even promise me a pair of bullocks.\n\nWhen I am absent in far distant places,  \nThen all with open hands their gifts would bring me . . .  \nLo! I will make the wealthy niggard needy,  \nSeize by the foot and on the hard rock dash him.  \n                                               _Rigveda_ , x, 27.\n\nThe lord of both the worlds hates all the haughty,  \nHe cares for those who feel themselves but human.  \n                                           Rigveda, vi, 47. 1\n\nThese verses recall: "Silence, thou evil one," roared Thor, "or else with my\nhammer shall I strike thy head off and end thy life."\n\nThen did Loke answer humbly: "Silent indeed I shall be now, O Thor, for I know\nfull well thou wilt strike." 2\n\n\n\n[![THE PARADISE OF INDRA<br> <i>From a rock sculpture at\nMamallapuram</i>](tn/01600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/01600.jpg)  \nTHE PARADISE OF INDRA  \n_From a rock sculpture at Mamallapuram_  \n\n\n\np. 17\n\nThe human qualities of Indra are illustrated in epic narrative. Arjuna, the\nIndian Achilles, is his son, and pays a visit to the brilliant Celestial city\non the summit of Mount Meru, where flowers are ever blooming, and pretty\nnymphs dance to pleasure battle-slain warriors.\n\nArjuna saluted his divine sire. "And Indra thereupon embraced him with his\nround and plump arms. And taking his hand, Shakra (Indra) made him sit on a\nportion of his own seat . . . And the lord of the Celestials--that slayer of\nhostile heroes--smelt the head of Arjuna, bending in humility, and even took\nhim upon his lap . . . Moved by affection, the slayer of Vritra touched that\nbeautiful face with his own perfumed hands. And the wielder of the\nthunderbolt, patting and rubbing gently again and again with his own hands,\nwhich bore the marks of the thunderbolt, the handsome and large arms of\nArjuna, which resembled a couple of golden columns and were hard in\nconsequence of drawing the bowstring and shooting arrows, began to console\nhim. And the slayer of Vritra . . . eyeing his son of curling locks smilingly\nand with eyes expanded with delight, seemed scarcely to be gratified. The more\nhe gazed, the more he liked to gaze on. And seated on one seat, the father and\nson enhanced the beauty of the assembly, like the sun and moon beautifying the\nfirmament together." 1\n\nIndra was attended in his heaven by vague spirits, called Vasus, who appear to\nhave acted as his counsellors. When Bhishma, a hero of the great Bh\xc4\x83rata war,\nwas slain in battle, he was given a place among the Vasus. The Thunder god\'s\nqueen is a shadowy personality, and is called Indrani.\n\nIndra was attended by a dog, as befitted a deity of\n\np. 18\n\nprimitive huntsmen. After the early Aryan period, he showed less favour for\nhis bays and chariot, and seated himself upon a great white elephant, "the\nhandsome and ever victorious", named Airavata; it "was furnished with four\ntusks" and "resembled the mountain of Kailasa with its summits".\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[3:1](iml06.htm#fr_41) _2 Kings_ , v, 18.\n\n[4:1](iml06.htm#fr_42) One of the sections of the epic Mahabharata is called\n"Go-Harran", which signifies "cattle harrying".\n\n[7:1](iml06.htm#fr_43) The deified poets and sages.
