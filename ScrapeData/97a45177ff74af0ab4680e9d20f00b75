There is little novelty of\nincident in these Cantos and the result are exactly the same as before. In\nCanto LV. Akampan, at the command of Ravan, leads forth his troops. Evil omens\nare seen and heard. The enemies meet, and many fall on each side, the Vanars\ntransfixed with arrows, the Rakshases crushed with rooks and trees.\n\nIn Canto LVI. Akampan sees that the Rakshases are worsted, and fights with\nredoubled rage and vigour. The Vanars fall fast under his "nets of arrows."\nHanuman comes to the rescue. He throws mountain peaks at the giant which are\ndexterously stopped with flights of arrows; and at last beats him down and\nkills him with a tree.\n\nIn Canto LVII. Ravan is seriously alarmed. He declares that he himself,\nKumbhakarna or Prahasta, must go forth. Prahasta sallies out vaunting that the\nfowls of the air shall eat their fill of Vanar flesh.\n\nIn Canto LVIII. the two armies meet. Dire is the conflict; ceaseless is the\nrain of stones and arrows. At last Nila meets Prahasta and breaks his bow.\nPrahasta leaps from his car, and the giant and the Vanar fight on foot. Nila\nwith a huge tree crushes his opponent who falls like a tree when its roots are\ncut.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LIX.: Ravans Sally.](ry454.htm)\n\n'
