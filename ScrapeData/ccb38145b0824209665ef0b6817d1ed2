And when we find that in meditations\non Brahman as abiding within a small place it is said that Brahman is greater\nthan the earth, or that the ether within the heart is as great as the\nuniversal ether, these attributes cannot be taken in their literal sense and\nhence included in those meditations, but must be viewed as merely meant to\nglorify the object proposed for meditation.--Herewith terminates the adhikara\n_n_ a of 'holding together.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 24.
