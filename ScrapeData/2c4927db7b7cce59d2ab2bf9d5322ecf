Lomas\xc2\x92a said :-- O Munis! Utatthya, the son of Devadatta, was quite\nignorant of anything of the Vedas, Japam (muttering of mantra), meditation of\nthe deity, worship of the Devas, \xc3\x82sana (Posture), Pra _n_ ayama (withholding\nthe breath by way of religious austerity), Pratyahara (restraint of mind),\nBhutas\xc2\x92uddhi (purification of the elements of the body by respiratory\nattraction and replacement), mantra (a mystical formula regarding some deity),\nKilaka (chanting of a mantra to serve as a pin of protection), Gayattri (the\nfamous mantra of the Brahmi _n_ s), Saucha (cleanliness, external and\ninternal), rules how to bathe, \xc3\x82chamana (sipping of water and reciting\nmantrams before worship), Pra _n_ agnihotra (offering of oblations to the fire\nof Pra _n_ a or to the fire of life), the offering of a sacrifice,\nhospitality, Sandhya (the morning, mid-day or evening prayer), collecting\nfuels for oblations, and offering of oblations. Daily he rose in the morning\nand somehow rinsed his mouth and washed his teeth and bathed in the Ganges\nriver without any mantrams (like a Sudra).\n\n\n\n6\\. That stupid fellow ate indiscriminately, did not know what to eat and what\nnot to eat. During the mid-day he collected the fruits from the forest and\nused to eat them.\n\n\n\n7\\. But he always spoke truth while he stayed there; never did he say any\nuntruth. The people of that place, seeing this, named him Satyatapa.\n\n\n\n8-9. That Utatthya did no good or bad to anybody; he slept peacefully and\nblissfully; but be used to think when he would die; thus his troubles would be\nended; he felt that the life of an illiterate Brahma _n_ is a curse; his death\nwould be a better alternative.\n\n\n\n10\\. He used to think thus :-- Fate has made me a fool; I do not find any\nother cause for it. Oh! I got the exceedingly good birth amongst men; but all\nthis has been rendered in vain by Fate.\n\n\n\n11\\. Oh! As a fair woman, if barren, a cow if giving no milk, and a tree\nwithout any fruits are all useless, so Fate has rendered my life, too, quite\nuseless.\n\n\n\np. 160\n\n\n\n12\\. Why am I cursing Fate? This is all the fruits of my past Karma. In my\nprevious life I never wrote a book and presented to a good Brahmi _n_ ; hence\nI am illiterate in this birth.\n\n\n\n13\\. In my former birth I did not impart any knowledge to my favourite pupils;\nhence I am wicked and a cursed Brahmi _n_ in this birth.\n\n\n\n14\\. I never performed any religious asceticism in any holy place, I did not\nserve the saints, I never worshipped the Brahmi _n_ s with any offerings. For\nall these reasons I am now born of perverted intellect in the present birth.\n\n\n\n15\\. Many a son of the Munis have learnt the meanings of the Vedas and the\nS\xc2\x92astras; and I am whiling away my time thus in a quite illiterate condition\nby some wretched combinations of incidents.\n\n\n\n16\\. I do not know how to perform Tapasya; what is the use, then, of my\nattempting to do so? I am of very bad luck, and thus my good resolve will not\nbe crowned with success.\n\n\n\n17\\. I consider Fate to be the strongest of all; Fie on one\xc2\x92s own prowess! For\nactions done with effort and hard labour are frustrated entirely by Fate.\n\n\n\n18\\. Time can never be overstepped; See! Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra, Indra, and\nothers are all under the influence of the Great Time.\n\n\n\n19\\. O Ri _s_ is! Thus arguing in his mind, that Brahmi _n_ son Utatthya\nstayed there in that hermitage on the bank of the holy Ganges.\n\n\n\n20\\. And gradually he became thoroughly unattached to all the things and,\nbeing peaceful, passed away his time in that forest without any habitations\nand men, with great difficulty.\n\n\n\n21\\. Thus passed away fourteen years in that forest where the Ganges was\nflowing. Still he did not learn how to worship the Supreme Deity, how to make\nJapam, nor did he learn any mantrams. Simply he lived there and whiled away\nhis time.\n\n\n\n22\\. People surrounding that place knew this much only of him that this Muni\nspoke truth only and hence his name was Satyavrata. This one name made him\ncelebrated that he is Satyavrata; never did he say any untruth.\n\n\n\n23\\. Once on a time, a hunter named Ni _s_ ada, exceedingly clever in hunting,\ncame accidentally with bows and arms in his hands, while hunting a deer in\nthat wide forest. He looked like a second God of Death (Yama) and seemed to be\nvery cruel.\n\n\n\n24\\. That savage mountaineer, drawing his bow so as to touch the ear, pierced\na boar with his sharp arrows. The boar, being very much terrified, fled with\nenormous rapidity to the Muni Satyavrata.\n\n\n\np. 161\n\n\n\n25\\. On seeing the distressed condition of the boar trembling with fear and\nhis body besmeared with blood, the Muni was moved with mercy.\n\n\n\n26\\. While the boar, pierced with arrows and besmeared with blood, was running\naway in front of him, mercy took possession of the Muni, therefore the Muni\nbegan to tremble and agreeably to the human nature exclaimed \xc2\x93Ai\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Ai\xc2\x94 (go to\nthat direction), the seed mantram of the Goddess of learning with \xc2\x93m\xc2\x94 left out\n(Aim, Aim).\n\n\n\n27\\. That illiterate Brahmi _n_ son never heard before that \xc2\x93Ai\xc2\x94 was the seed\nmantram of the Sarasvati Devi; nor did he come to know of it by any other\nmeans. Accidentally it came out of his mouth, and he uttered. And afterwards\nthat Mahatma seeing the boar's distressed condition was merged in deep sorrow.\n\n\n\n28\\. The boar entered trembling into the Muni's hermitage very much distracted\nand being very much pained with arrows. Being unable to find any other way the\nboar hid himself in the dense bushes.\n\n\n\n29\\. Instantly there appeared then, before the Muni, the terrible savage\nhunter, like a second God of Death, with string stretched to his ear, in\npursuit of that boar.\n\n\n\n30-33. On seeing the Muni Satyavrata sitting there alone and silent on the\nKus\xc2\x92a grass seat, the hunter bowed down to him and asked \xc2\x93O Brahmi _n!_\nWhither has that boar gone. I know very well everything about you that you\nnever speak untruth; therefore I am enquiring about the boar pierced by my\narrows. My family members are all very hungry; and to feed them, I am come out\nin this hunting. This is the living, ordained by the Fate; I have got no other\nmeans of maintaining the livelihood of my family. This I speak truly to you;\nwhether it is bad or good, I will have to maintain my family with it. O Brahma\n_n_! You are famous as Satyavrata; my family members are starving; kindly\nreply quickly where that boar has gone?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n34\\. Thus asked by the hunter, the Mahatma Satyavrata was merged in an ocean\nof doubt; he began to argue \xc2\x93If I say I have not seen the boar then my vow to\nspeak the truth will certainly be broken.\n\n\n\n35\\. The boar struck with arrows has gone this way, it is true. How can I tell\na lie? Again this man is hungry and is therefore asking, he will instantly\nkill the boar no sooner he finds him. How then can I speak truth?\n\n\n\n36\\. Where speaking out the truth causes injury and the loss of lives, that\ntruth is no truth at all; moreover, even untruth, when tempered with mercy for\nthe welfare of others, is recognised as truth. Really speaking, whatever\n\n\n\np. 162\n\n\n\nleads to the welfare of all the beings in this world, that is truth; and every\nthing else is not truth.\n\n\n\n37\\. O Jamadagni! Thus placed between the horns of a religious dilemma what\nshall I do now so as to meet both the ends -- to save the life of the boar, to\ndo the welfare, as well as not to speak untruth.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n38\\. When Satyavrata saw the boar wounded by the arrow of the hunter, he,\nmoved with pity, uttered the seed mantra of the Goddess of Learning; and now\nthat most auspicious Goddess, on account of his uttering Her seed mantram, was\nvery pleased and gave him the knowledge, difficult to be attained otherwise.\n\n\n\n39\\. The door of all his knowledge opened out at once, and he became at once\ninstantly the seer, the poet like the ancient Muni Valmiki.\n\n\n\n40\\. Then that religiously disposed, merciful Brahma _n_ , aiming at Truth,\naddressed that hunter before him with bows in his arms, thus :--\n\n\n\n41\\. That force which sees (as witness) never speaks; and that force which\nspeaks, never sees. O hunter! Why are you asking me repeatedly, impelled by\nyour own selfish desire?\n\n\n\n42\\. The hunter, the killer of the animals, on hearing this was disappointed\nin the matter of finding out the boar and went back to his home.\n\n\n\n43\\. That Brahmi _n_ turned out a poet like Varu _n_ a and he became\ncelebrated as Satyavrata, the speaker of truth, in all the worlds.\n\n\n\n44\\. He began to recite the Satyavrata mantram duly, and, by its influence,\nbecame a Pundit, rivalled by none in this world.\n\n\n\n45\\. During every festival the Brahma _n_ s chanted his praise and the Munis\nused to narrate his story in detail.\n\n\n\n46\\. On hearing his fame spreading all around, his father Devadatta who\nforsook him before, recalled him to his hermitage and took him again in his\nfamily with great honour and affection.\n\n\n\n47\\. Therefore O King! You should always worship and serve that Great Goddess,\nthe Prime Energy, the Cause of all this Universe.\n\n\n\n48\\. O King! With due Vedic rites you perform that sacrifice to that Goddess\nwhich will surely yield results at all times and all desires. I already spoke\nto you about this.\n\n\n\n49\\. That Great Goddess is known as Kamada (the giver of all desires); for She\ngrants all desires when men with devotion remember Her, worship Her, take Her\nname, meditate Her and eulogise Her.\n\n\n\n50-56. O King! The wise sages ought to see the persons diseased, distressed,\nhungry, those without any wealth, the hypocrite, the cheat, the afflicted,\n\n\n\np. 163\n\n\n\nthe sensual, the covetous, the incapable, always suffering from mental\ntroubles; again those who are wealthy with their children and grand-children,\nprosperous, healthy, with enjoyments, versed in the Vedas, literary, kings,\nheroes, those who command over many, those attended with relations and kinsmen\nand endowed with all good qualities; and then judge for themselves that those\npeople did not worship the Goddess and therefore they were sufferers and these\npeople worshipped the Goddess and hence they were happy in this world.\n\n\n\n57\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus I heard from the mouth of Lomas'a Muni, in assembly\nof the sages, the good merits of the Great Goddess.\n\n\n\n58\\. O King! Consider all these and you will find that the Highest Goddess,\nthe Bhagavati is to be worshipped always with devotion and unselfish love.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eleventh Chapter on the merits of the Devi in the story of\nSatyavrata in the Third Skandha of the Maha Pura _n_ am S'ri mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk03ch12.htm)\n\n"
