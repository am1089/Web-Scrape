Aufrecht's Romanised Reprint of the Rig-veda.But\nmost of these mistakes are mistakes which no attentive reader could fail to\ndetect. Cases like II, 35, 1, where _g_ o _g_ ishat instead of _g_ oshishat\nwas printed three times, so as to perplex even Professor Roth, or II, 12, 14,\nwhere _s_ asamanam occurs three times instead of _s_ a _s_ amanam, are, I\nbelieve, of rare occurrence. Nor do I think that, unless some quite unexpected\ndiscoveries are made, there ever will be a new critical edition, or, as we\ncall it in Germany, a new recension of the hymns of the Rig-veda. If by\ncollating new MSS., or by a careful study of the Prati _s_ akhya, or by\nconjectural emendations, a more correct text could have been produced, we may\nbe certain that a critical scholar like Professor Aufrecht would have given us\nsuch a text. But after carefully collating several MSS. of Professor Wilson's\ncollection, and after enjoying the advantage of Professor Weber's assistance\nin collating the MSS. of the Royal Library at Berlin, and after a minute study\nof the Prati _s_ akhya, he frankly states that in the text of the Rig-veda,\ntranscribed in Roman letters, which he printed at Berlin, he followed my\nedition, and that he had to correct but a small number of misprints. For the\ntwo Ma _n_ _d_ alas which I had not yet published, I lent him the very MSS. on\nwhich my edition is founded; and there will be accordingly but few passages in\nthese two concluding Ma _n_ _d_ alas, which I have still to publish, where the\ntext will materially differ from that of his Romanised transcript.\n\nNo one, I should think, who is at all acquainted with the rules of diplomatic\ncriticism, would easily bring himself to\n\np. xlvi\n\ntouch a text resting on such authorities as the text of the Rig-veda. What\nwould a Greek scholar give, if he could say of Homer that his text was in\nevery word, in every syllable, in every vowel, in every accent, the same as\nthe text used by Peisistratos in the sixth century b.c.! A text thus preserved\nin its integrity for so many centuries, must remain for ever the authoritative\ntext of the Veda.\n\nTo remove, for instance, the eleven hymns 49-59 in the eighth Ma _n_ _d_ ala\nfrom their proper place, or count them by Valakhilya Hymns.themselves as\nValakhilya a hymns, seems to me, though no doubt perfectly harmless, little\nshort of a critical sacrilege. Why Saya _n_ a does not explain these hymns, I\nconfess I do not know b; but whatever the reason was, it was not because they\ndid not exist at his time, or because he thought them spurious. They are\nregularly counted in Katyayana's Sarvanukrama, though here the same accident\nhas happened. One commentator, Sha _d_ guru _s_ ishya, the one most commonly\nused, does not explain them; but another commentator, _G_ agannatha, does\nexplain them, exactly as they occur in the Sarvanukrama, only leaving out hymn\n58. That these hymns had something peculiar in the eyes of native scholars, is\nclear enough. They may for a time have formed a separate collection, they\n\np. xlvii\n\nmay have been considered of more modern origin a. I shall go even further than\nthose who remove these hymns from the place which they have occupied for more\nthan two thousand years. I admit they disturb the regularity both of the Ma\n_n_ _d_ ala and the Ash _t_ aka divisions, and I have pointed out myself that\nthey are not counted in the ancient Anukrama _n_ is ascribed to _S_ aunaka;\n(History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 220.) But, on the other hand,\nverses taken from these hymns occur in all the other Vedas b; they are\nmentioned by name in the Brahma _n_ as (Ait. Br. V, 15; VI, 24), the \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyakas (Ait. \xc3\x82r. V, 10, p. 445), and the Sutras (\xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ rauta Sutras,\nVIII, 2, 3), while they are never included in the manuscripts of Pari _s_ ish\n_t_ as or Khilas or apocryphal hymns, nor mentioned by Katyayana as mere\nKhilas in his Sarvanukrama. Eight c of them are mentioned in the B _ri_\nhaddevata, without any allusion to their apocryphal character:\n\nPara _n_ y ash _t_ au tu suktany _ri_ shi _n_ am tigmate _g_ asam,  \nAindra _n_ y atra tu sha _d_ vi _m_ _s_ a _h_ pragatho bahudaivata _h_.  \n_Ri_ g antyagner a _k_ ety agni _h_ suryam antyapado _g_ agau.  \nPraska _n_ va _s_ _k_ a p _ri_ shadhra _s_ _k_ a pradad yad vastu ki _m_ _k_\nana  \nBhurid iti tu suktabhyam akhilam parikirtitam.  \nAindra _n_ y ubhayam ity atra sha _l_ agneyat para _n_ i tu.\n\n'The next eight hymns belong to _Ri_ shis of keen intellect d; they are\naddressed to Indra, but the 26th Pragatha\n\np. xlviii\n\n[paragraph continues] (VIII, 54, 3-4, which verses form the 26th couplet, if\ncounting from VIII, 49, 1) is addressed to many gods. The last verse (of these\neight hymns), VIII, 56, 5, beginning with the words a _k_ ety agni _h_ , is\naddressed to Agni, and the last foot celebrates Surya. Whatsoever Praska _n_\nva and P _ri_ shadhra gave (or, if we read p _ri_ shadhraya, whatever Praska\n_n_ va gave to P _ri_ shadhra), all that is celebrated in the two hymns\nbeginning with bhurit. After the hymn addressed to Agni (VIII, 60), there\nfollow six hymns addressed to Indra, beginning with ubhayam.'\n\nBut the most important point of all is this, that these hymns, which exist\nboth in the Pada and Sa _m_ hita texts, are quoted by the Prati _s_ akhya, not\nonly for general purposes, but for special passages occurring in them, and\nnowhere else. Thus in Sutra 154, hetaya _h_ is quoted as one of the few words\nwhich do not require the elision of a following short a. In order to\nappreciate what is implied by this special quotation, it is necessary to have\na clear insight into the mechanism of the Prati _s_ akhya. Its chief object is\nto bring under general categories the changes which the separate words of the\nPada text undergo when joined together in the \xc3\x82rshi Sa _m_ hita, and to do\nthis with the utmost brevity possible. Now the Sandhi rules, as observed in\nthe Sa _m_ hita of the Rig-veda, are by no means so uniform and regular as\nthey are in later Sanskrit, and hence it is sometimes extremely difficult to\nbring all the exceptional cases under more or less general rules. In our\npassage the author of the Prati _s_ akhya endeavours to comprehend all the\npassages where an initial a in the Veda is not elided after a final e or o. In\nordinary Sanskrit it would be always elided, in the Sa _m_ hita it is\nsometimes elided, and sometimes not. Thus the Prati _s_ akhya begins in Sutra\n138 by stating that if the short a stands at the beginning of a pada or foot,\nit is always elided. Why it should be always elided in the very place where\nthe metre most strongly requires that it should be pronounced, does not\nconcern the author of the Prati _s_ akhya. He is a statistician, not a\ngrammarian, and he therefore simply adds in Sutra 153 the only three\nexceptional passages where the a, under these very circumstances,\n\np. xlix\n\nhappens to be not elided. He then proceeds in Sutra 139 to state that a is\nelided even in the middle of a pada, provided it be light, followed by y or v,\nand these y or v, again followed by a light vowel. Hence the Sa _m_ hita\nwrites to \xe0\xa4\xbdva\xcc\x86dan, so\xe0\xa4\xbdya\xcc\x86m, but not _s_ ikshanto\xe0\xa4\xbdvratam, for here the a of\navratam is heavy; nor mitramaho\xe0\xa4\xbdvadyat, for here the a following the v is\nheavy.\n\nThen follows again an extension of this rule, viz. in the case of words ending\nin avo. After these, a short a, even if followed by other consonants besides y\nor v, may be elided, but the other conditions must be fulfilled, i. e. the\nshort a must be light, and the vowel of the next syllable must again be light.\nThus the Sa _m_ hita writes indeed gavo\xe0\xa4\xbdbhi\xcc\x86ta _h_ , but not gavo\xe0\xa4\xbdgman,\nbecause here the a is heavy, being followed by two consonants.\n\nAfter this, a more general rule is given, or, more correctly, a more\ncomprehensive observation is made, viz. that under all circumstances initial a\nis elided, if the preceding word ends in aye, aya _h_ , ave, or ava _h_. As\nmight be expected, however, so large a class must have numerous exceptions,\nand these can only be collected by quoting every word ending in these\nsyllables, or every passage in which the exceptions occur. Before these\nexceptions are enumerated, some other more or less general observations are\nmade, providing for the elision of initial a. Initial a, according to Sutra\n142, is to be elided if the preceding word is va _h_ , and if this va _h_ is\npreceded by a, na, pra, kva, _k_ itra _h_ , savita, eva, or ka _h_. There is,\nof course, no intelligible reason why, if these words precede va _h_ , the\nnext a should be elided. It is a mere statement of facts, and, generally\nspeaking, these statements are minutely accurate. There is probably no verse\nin the whole of the Rig-veda where an initial a after va _h_ is elided, unless\nthese very words precede, or unless some other observation has been made to\nprovide for the elision of the a. For instance, in V, 25, 1, we find va _h_\npreceded by a _k_ _kh_ a, which is not among the words just mentioned, and\nhere the Sa _m_ hita does not elide the a of agnim, which follows after va\n_h_. After all these more or less general observations as to the elision of\n\np. l\n\nan initial a are thus exhausted, the author of the Prati _s_ akhya descends\ninto particulars, and gives lists, first, of words the initial a of which is\nalways elided; secondly, of words which, if preceding, require under all\ncircumstances the elision of the initial a of the next word, whatever may have\nbeen said to the contrary in the preceding Sutras. Afterwards, he gives a\nnumber of passages which defy all rules, and must be given on their own\nmerits, and as they stand in the Sa _m_ hita. Lastly, follow special\nexceptions to the more or less general rules given before. And here, among\nthese special exceptions, we see that the author of the Prati _s_ akhya finds\nit necessary to quote a passage from a Valakhilya hymn in which hetaya _h_\noccurs, i. e. a word ending in aya _h_ , and where, in defiance of Sutra 141,\nwhich required the elision of a following initial a under all circumstances\n(sarvatha), the initial a of asya is not elided; VIII, 50, 2, Sa _m_ hita, _s_\nata\xc2\xb4nika hetayo asya. It might be objected that the Prati _s_ akhya only\nquotes hetaya _h_ as an exceptional word, and does not refer directly to the\nverse in the Valakhilya hymn. But fortunately hetaya _h_ occurs but twice in\nthe whole of the Rig-veda; and in the other passage where it occurs, I, 190,\n4, neither the rule nor the exception as to the elision of an initial a, could\napply. The author of the Prati _s_ akhya therefore makes no distinction\nbetween the Valakhilya and any other hymns of the Rig-veda, and he would have\nconsidered his phonetic statistics equally at fault, if it had been possible\nto quote one single passage from the hymns VIII, 49 to 59, as contravening his\nobservations, as if such passages had been alleged from the hymns of Vasish\n_th_ a or Vi _s_ vamitra.\n\nIt would lead me too far, were I to enter here into similar cases in support\nof the fact that the Prati _s_ akhya makes no distinction between the\nValakhilya and any other hymns of the Rig-veda-sa _m_ hita a. But I doubt\nwhether the bearing of this fact has ever been fully realised. Here we see\nthat the absence of the elision of a short a which follows after a word ending\nin aya _h_ , was considered of sufficient importance\n\np. li\n\nto be recorded in a special rule, because in most cases the Sa _m_ hita elides\nan initial a, if preceded by a word ending in aya _h_. What does this prove?\nIt proves, unless all our views on the chronology of Vedic literature are\nwrong, that in the fifth century b.c. at least, or previously rather to the\ntime when the Prati _s_ akhya was composed, both the Pada and the Sa _m_ hita\ntexts were so firmly settled that it was impossible, for the sake of\nuniformity or regularity, to omit one single short a; and it proves a\nfortiori, that the hymn in which that irregular short a occurs, formed at that\ntime part of the Vedic canon. I confess I feel sometimes frightened by the\nstringency of this argument, and I should like to see a possibility by which\nwe could explain the addition, not of the Valakhilya hymns only, but of other\nmuch more modern sounding hymns, at a later time than the period of the Prati\n_s_ akhyas. But until that possibility is shown, we must abide by our own\nconclusions; and then I ask, who is the critic who would dare to tamper with a\ncanon of scripture of which every iota was settled before the time of Cyrus,\nand which we possess in exactly that form in which it is described to us by\nthe authors of the Prati _s_ akhyas? I say again, that I am not free from\nmisgivings on the subject, and my critical conscience would be far better\nsatisfied if we could ascribe the Prati _s_ akhya and all it presupposes to a\nmuch later date. But until that is done, the fact remains that the two\ndivergent texts, the Pada and Sa _m_ hita, which we now possess, existed, as\nwe now possess them, previous to the time of the Prati _s_ akhya. They have\nnot diverged nor varied since, and the vertex to which they point, starting\nfrom the distance of the two texts as measured by the Prati _s_ akhya, carries\nus back far beyond the time of _S_ aunaka, if we wish to determine the date of\nthe first authorised collection of the hymns, both in their Pada and in their\nSa _m_ hita form.\n\nInstances abound, if we compare the Pada and Sa _m_ hita texts, where, if\nuniformity between the two texts had been the object of the scholars of the\nancient Parishads, the lengthening or shortening of a vowel would at once have\nremoved the apparent discordance between the two traditional\n\np. lii\n\ntexts. Nor should it be supposed that such minute discordances between the\ntwo, as the length or shortness of a vowel, were always rendered necessary by\nthe requirements of the metre, and that for that reason the ancient students\nor the later copyists of the Veda abstained from altering the peculiar\nspelling of words, which seemed required by the exigencies of the metre in the\nSa _m_ hita text, but not in the Pada text. Though this may be true in some\ncases it is not so in all. There are short vowels in the Sa _m_ hita where,\naccording to grammar, we expect long vowels, and where, according to metre,\nthere was no necessity for shortening them. Yet in these very places all the\nMSS. of the Sa _m_ hita text give the irregular short, and all the MSS. of the\nPada text the regular long vowel, and the authors of the Prati _s_ akhyas bear\nwitness that the same minute difference existed at their own time, nay,\nprevious to their own time. In VII, 60, 12, the Sa _m_ hita text gives:\n\niya _m_ deva purohitir yuvabhya _m_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ eshu mitravaru _n_ av akari.\n\nThis primacy, O (two) gods, was made for you two, O Mitra and Varu _n_ a, at\nthe sacrifices!\n\nHere it is quite clear that deva is meant for a dual, and ought to have been\ndeva or devau. The metre does not require a short syllable, and yet all the Sa\n_m_ hita MSS. read deva, and all the Pada MSS. read deva; and what is more\nimportant, the authors of the Prati _s_ akhya had to register this small\ndivergence of the two texts, which existed in their time as it exists in our\nown a.\n\nNor let it be supposed, that the writers of our MSS. were so careful and so\nconscientious that they would, when copying MSS., regulate every consonant or\nvowel according to the rules of the Prati _s_ akhya. This is by no means the\ncase. The writers of Vedic MSS. are on the whole more accurate than the\nwriters of other MSS., but their learning does not seem to extend to a\nknowledge of the minute rules of the Prati _s_ akhya, and they will commit\n\np. liii\n\noccasionally the very mistakes against which they are warned by the Prati _s_\nakhya. Thus the Prati _s_ akhya (Sutra 799) warns the students against a\ncommon mistake of changing vaiya _s_ va into vayya _s_ va, i. e. by changing\nai to a, and doubling the semivowel y. But this very mistake occurs in S 2,\nand another MS. gives vaiyya _s_ va. See [p. lvi](sbe3207.htm#page_lvi).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xlvi:a](sbe3205.htm#fr_29) The earliest interpretation of the name Valakhilya\nis found in the Taittiriya-ara _n_ yaka, I, 23. We are told that Pra _g_ apati\ncreated the world, and in the process of creation the following interlude\noccurs:\n\nsa tapo\xe0\xa4\xbdtapyata. sa tapas taptva _s_ ariram adhunuta. tasya yan ma _m_ sam\nasit tato\xe0\xa4\xbdru _n_ a _h_ ketavo vatara _s_ ana _ri_ shaya udatish _th_ an. ye\nnakha _h_ , te vaikhanasa _h_. ye bala _h_ , te balakhilya _h_.\n\nHe burned with emotion. Having burnt with emotion, he shook his body. From\nwhat was his flesh, the _Ri_ shis, called Aru _n_ as, Ketus, and Vatara _s_\nanas, sprang forth. His nails became the Vaikhanasas, his hairs the\nBalakhilyas.\n\nThe author of this allegory therefore took bala or vala in valakhilya, not in\nthe sense of Child, but identified it with bala, hair.\n\nThe commentator remarks with regard to tapas: natra tapa upavasadirupam, ki\n_m_ tu srash _t_ avya _m_ vastu kid _ri_ _s_ am iti paryalo _k_ anarupam.\n\n[xlvi:b](sbe3205.htm#fr_30) A similar omission was pointed out by Professor\nRoth. Verses 21-24 of the 53rd hymn of the third Ma _n_ _d_ ala, which contain\nimprecations against Vasish _th_ a, are left out by the writer of a Pada MS.,\nand by a copyist of Saya _n_ a's commentary, probably because they both\nbelonged to the family of Vasish _th_ a. See my first edition of the Rig-veda,\nvol. ii, p. lvi, Notes.\n\n[xlvii:a](sbe3205.htm#fr_31) Saya _n_ a (RV. X, 88, 18) quotes these hymns as\nValakhilya-sa _m_ hita. In the Mahabharata XII, 59; 110 seq. the Valakhilyas\nare called the ministers of King Vainya, whose astrologer was Garga, and his\ndomestic priest _S_ ukra; see Kern, B _ri_ hat-sa _m_ hita, transl. p. 11.\n\n[xlvii:b](sbe3205.htm#fr_32) This is a criterion of some importance, and it\nmight have been mentioned, for instance, by Professor Bollensen in his\ninteresting article on the Dvipada Vira _g_ hymns ascribed to Para _s_ ara (I,\n65-70) that not a single verse of them occurs in any of the other Vedas.\n\n[xlvii:c](sbe3205.htm#fr_33) Saya _n_ a in his commentary (RV. X, 27, 15)\nspeaks of eight, while in the Ait. \xc3\x82r. V, 10, the first six are quoted\n(containing fifty-six verses, comm.), as being used together for certain\nsacrificial purposes.\n\n[xlvii:d](sbe3205.htm#fr_34) Lest Saunaka be suspected of having applied this\nepithet, tigmate _g_ as, to the Valakhilyas in order to fill the verse\n(padapura _n_ artham), I may point out that the same epithet is applied to the\nValakhilyas in the Maitry-upanishad 2, 3. The nom. plur. which occurs there is\ntigmate _g_ asa _h_ , and the commentator remarks: tigmate _g_ asas tivrate\n_g_ aso\xe0\xa4\xbdtyur _g_ itaprabhava _h_ ; te _g_ asa ityeva _m_ vidha eta _k_ _kh_\nakhasa\xe1\xb9\x85ketapa _th_ a _s_ _kh_ andasa _h_ sarvatra. See also Maitr. Up. VI, 29.\n\n[l:a](sbe3205.htm#fr_35) The Prati _s_ akhya takes into account both the _S_\nakala and Bashkala _s_ akhas, as may be seen from Sutra 1057.\n\n[lii:a](sbe3205.htm#fr_36) See Prati _s_ akhya, Sutra 309 seqq., where several\nmore instances of the same kind are given. I should prefer to take\ndevapurohiti as one word, but that was not the intention of the authors of the\nSa _m_ hita and Pada texts.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Part 4](sbe3206.htm)\n\n"
