And on account of the mantra.\n\n'One part (quarter) of it are all beings, three feet (quarters) of it are the\nImmortal in heaven' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 12, 6)--on account of this mantra also\nthe soul must be held to be a part of Brahman. For the word 'foot' denotes a\npart. As the individual souls are many the mantra uses the plural form 'all\nbeings.' In the Sutra (42) the word 'part' is in the singular, with a view to\ndenote the whole class. For the same reason in II, 3, 18 also the word 'atman'\nis in the singular. For that the individual Selfs are different from the Lord,\nand are many and eternal, is declared by texts such as 'He who, eternal and\nintelligent, fulfils the desires of many who likewise are eternal and\nintelligent' (Ka. Up. II, 5, 13). Since thus the plurality of the eternal\nindividual Selfs rests on good authority, those who have an insight into the\ntrue nature of Selfs will discern without difficulty different characteristics\ndistinguishing the individual Selfs, although all Selfs are alike in so far as\nhaving intelligence for their essential nature. Moreover the Sutra II, 3, 48\ndirectly states the plurality of the individual Selfs.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 44. Moreover it is so stated in Smriti](sbe48290.htm)\n\n"
