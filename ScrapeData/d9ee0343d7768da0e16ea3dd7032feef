S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a spoke :-- O Child Narada! Hear now the wonderful\nanecdotes of the births of the remaining other Manus. The mere remembrance of\nthese birth anecdotes causes Bhakti to grow and well up towards the Devi.\nVaivasvata Manu had six sons :-- viz., Karu _s_ a, P _r_ i _s_ adhra, Nabhaga,\nDi _st_ a, Saryati, and Tris'a _n_ ku. All of them were stout and strong. Once\nthey all united went to the excellent banks of the Jumna and began to practise\nPra _n_ ayama without taking any food and became engaged in worshipping the\nDevi. Each of them built separately an earthen image of the Devi and\nworshipped Her with devotion and with various offerings. In the beginning,\nthey took the dry leaves of the trees that dropped of themselves for their\nfood; then they drank water only, then breathed air only; then the smoke from\nthe fire of the Homa; then they depended on the Solar Rays. Thus they\npractised tapasya with great difficulties. The continual worship of the Devi\nwith the greatest devotion made them conscious of their clear intellect,\ndestructive of all sorts of vanities and delusions, and the Manu's sons\nthought only of the Hallowed Feet of the Devi; their intellects were purified\nand they were greatly wondered to see within their Self the whole Universe.\nThus they practised their Tapasya full twelve years when Bhagavati, the Ruling\nPrinciple of this Universe resplendent wiih the brilliance of the thousand\nSuns, appeared before them. The princes with their intelligences thus purified\nsaw Her, bowed down and, with their lowly hearts, began to chant hymns to Her\nwith greatest devotion. \xc2\x93O \xc3\x8es'ani! O Merciful! Thou art the Devi presiding\nover all. Thou art the Best. So Victory to Thee! Thou art known by the\nVagbhava Mantra. Thou gettest pleased when the Vagbhava Mantra is repeated. O\nDevi! Thou art of the nature of Klim Kara (of the form of Klim). Thou gettest\npleased with the repetition of Klim Mantra. O Thou, that gladdenest the Lord!\nThou bestowest joy and pleasure in the heart of the King of Kama. O Maha Maya!\nWhen Thou art pleased, Thou givest that Unequalled Kingdom. O Thou that\nincreasest the enjoyments! Thou art Vi _sn_ u, Surya, Hara, Indra and the\nother Devas.\xc2\x94 When the highsouled princes praised Her thus, Bhagavati became\npleased and spoke to them the following sweet words :-- \xc2\x93O Highsouled Princes!\nYou all have worshipped Me and practised, indeed, very hard tapasyas and thus\nyou have become sinless and your intellects and hearts have become thoroughly\npurged and thus purified. Now ask boons that you\n\n\n\np. 1047\n\n\n\ndesire. I will grant them ere long to you.\xc2\x94 The Princes said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! We\nwant unrivalled Kingdoms, many sons of long longevity, continual enjoyment of\npleasures, fame, energy, freedom in all actions, and as well the good and keen\nintelligence. These will be beneficial to us.\xc2\x94 The Devi said :-- Whatever you\nhave desired, I grant them to you all. Besides I give you another boon. Listen\nattentively. By My Grace you all will be the Lords of the Manvantaras and\nacquire strength that will experience no defeat, and you will get prosperity,\nfame, energy, powers, and a continual line of descent and abundant full\nenjoyments.\n\n\n\n22-32. Naraya _n_ a said :-- After the World Mother Bhramari Devi granted them\nthese boons, the princes chanted hymns to Her and then She instantly vanished.\nThe very energetic princes acquired in that birth excellent kingdoms and\nabundance of wealth. They all had sons and thus established their families,\nand became the Lords of Manvantara in their next births. By the Grace of the\nDevi, the first of the princes Karu _s_ a became the Ninth Manu, the\nexceedingly powerful Dak _s_ a Savar _n_ i; the second prince Pri _s_ adhra\nbecame the Tenth Manu, named Meru Savar _n_ i; the third prince, the highly\nenthusiastic Nabhaga became the Eleventh Manu, named Surya Savar _n_ i; the\nfourth prince Di _st_ a became the Twelfth Manu, named Chandra Savar _n_ i;\nthe powerful fifth prince S'aryati became the Thirteenth Manu named Rudra\nSavar _n_ i and the sixth prince Tris'anku became the Fourteenth Manu named Vi\n_sn_ u Savar _n_ i and became the celebrated Lord of the world.\n\n\n\n33-41. Narada questioned :-- \xc2\x93O Wise One! Who is that Bhramari Devi? What is\nHer Nature? What for She takes birth? Kindly describe all this beautiful and\npain destroying anecdotes to me. I am not satiated with the drinking of the\nnectar of the Glories of the Devi; my desire to hear further more is as strong\nas ever. As the drink of the nectar takes away death, so the drink of this\nanecdote of the Devi takes away the fear of death.\xc2\x94 Naraya _n_ a said :-- O\nNarada! I will now narrate the wonderful glories of that unthinkable,\nunmanifested World Mother, leading to Mukti. Hear, as a Mother behaves towards\nHer child kindly and without any hypocrisy, so the World Mother in all Her\nlives manifests Her merciful sincere dealings for the welfare of the humanity.\nIn days gone by, in the nether regions, in the city of the Daityas, there\nlived a powerful Daitya named Aru _n_ a. He was a furious Deva Hater and a\npakka hyprocrite. With a view to conquer the Devas, he went to the banks of\nthe Ganges in the Himalayas, practised a very bard Tapasya, to Brahma, taking\nHim to be the Protector of the Daityas. First influenced by Tamo Gu _n_ a, he\nwithheld in his body the five Vayus\n\n\n\np. 1048\n\n\n\nand partook only the dry leaves and repeated, the Gayatri Mantra and practised\nausterities. Thus he practised for full ten thousand years. Then for another\nten thousand years the Daitya lived drinking some drops of water only; then\nfor another ten thousand years he remained by inhaling air only; and then for\nanother ten thousand years he did not take any thing and thus practised he his\nwonderful Tapasya.\n\n\n\n42-49. Thus practising his Tapasya a sort of wonderful halo of light emitted\nfrom his body and began to burn the whole world. This thing then appeared a\ngreat wonder. All the Devas then exclaimed. \xc2\x93Oh! What is this! Oh! What is\nthis!\xc2\x94 And they trembled. All were very much terrified and took refuge of\nBrahma. Hearing all the news from the Devas, the four-faced Bhagavan rode on\nHis vehicle, the Swan, and with the Gayatri went very gladly to where the\nDaitya was practising his austerities and saw that the Daitya was immersed in\nmeditation with his eyes closed; and he looked, as it were, blazing with fire,\nas if a second Fire himself. His belly had become dried up, body withered and\nthe nerves of the bodies, too, became almost visible; only the life breath was\nlingering there. Brahma then spoke to him :-- \xc2\x93O Child! Auspices to you! Now\nask the boon that you desire.\xc2\x94 Hearing these gladdening nectar-like words from\nthe mouth of Brahma, Aru _n_ a, the chief of the Daityas opened his eyes and\nsaw Brahma in his front. Seeing Brahma before him with a rosary of beads and\nKama _nd_ alu in his hand and attended by Gayatri and the four Vedas,\nmuttering the name of the Eternal Brahma, the Daitya rose up and bowed down to\nHim and sang to Him various Stotras.\n\n\n\n50-59. Then the intelligent Daitya asked from Brahma the following boon that\n\xc2\x93I shall not die. Grant this.\xc2\x94 Brahma then gently explained to him :-- \xc2\x93O Best\nof the Danavas! See that Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes'vara and others are not free\nfrom this limitation of death! What to speak then for others! I cannot grant\nyou a boon that is an impossibility. Ask what is possible and just. The\nintelligent persons never show an eagerness to an impossibility.\xc2\x94 Hearing the\nabove words of Brahma, Aru _n_ a again said with devotion :-- \xc2\x93O Deva! If Thou\nart unwilling to grant me the above boon, then, O Lord! Grant me such a boon,\nas is practicable, that my death shall not be caused by any war, nor by any\narms or weapons, nor by any man or any woman, by any biped or quadruped or any\ncombination of two and grant me such a boon, such a large army as I can\nconquer the Devas.\xc2\x94 Hearing the words of the Daitya, Brahma said \xc2\x93Let that be\nso\xc2\x94 and went back instantly to His own abode. Then, puffed up with that boon,\nthe Daitya Aru _n_ a called on all the other Daityas that lived in\n\n\n\np. 1049\n\n\n\nthe nether regions. The Daityas, that were under his shelter, came and saluted\nhim, as their king and, by his command, they sent messengers to the Heavens to\nfight with the Devas. Hearing from the messenger that the Daityas were willing\nto fight with the Devas, Indra trembled with fear and went instantly with the\nDevas to the abode of Brahma. Taking Brahma, too, along with them from there,\nthey went to the Vi _sn_ u Loka and took Vi _sn_ u with them and all went to\nthe S\xc2\x92iva Loka.\n\n\n\n60-70. There they all held a conference how to kill the Daitya, the enemy of\nthe Gods. While, on the other hand, Aru _n_ a, the king of the Daityas\nsurrounded by his army, went ere long to the Heavens.\n\n\n\nO Muni! The Daitya, then, through the power of his Tapas, assumed various\nforms and seized the rights and possessions of the Moon, the Sun, Yama, Agni\nand all the othars. All the Devas, then, dislodged from their stations went to\nthe region of Kailas'a and represented to S\xc2\x92ankara about their own troubles\nand dangers respectively. Then, what was to be done on this subject, on this,\ngreat discussions cropped up. When Brahma said, that the death of the Daitya\nwould not ensue from any fight, with any arms or weapons, from any man or\nwoman, biped, quadruped or from any combination of the above two. Then the\nDevas became all anxious and could not find out any solution at that instant,\nwhen the Incorporeal Voice was clearly heard in the Heavens :-- Let you all\nworship the Queen of the Universe. She will carry out your work to success. If\nthe king of the Daityas, always engaged in muttering the Gayatri, forsakes the\nGayatri any how, then his death will occur. Hearing this gladdening Celestial\nVoice, the Devas held the council with great caution. When it was settled what\nought to be done, Indra asked Brihaspati and said :-- \xc2\x93O Guru Deva! You would\nbetter go to the Daitya for the carrying out of the Devas' ends and do so that\nhe forsakes the Devi Gayatri Parames\xc2\x92vari. We will all now go and meditate on\nHer. When She will be pleased, She will help us.\n\n\n\n71-77. Thus commanding Brihaspati and thinking that the beautiful Protectress\nof Jambu Nada would protect them the Devas all started to worship Her and,\ngoing there, began the Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a and with great devotion muttered the Maya\nVija and practised asceticism. On the other hand, Brihaspati went ere long in\nthe garb of a Muni to the Daitya Aru _n_ a. The king of the Daityas then asked\nhim :-- \xc2\x93O Best of Munis! Whence and why have you come here. Say, O Muni!\nWhere have you come? I am not one of your party. Rather I am your enemy.\xc2\x94\nHearing the above words, Brihaspati said :-- When you are worshipping\nincessantly the Devi whom we too worship, then say how you are not a one on\nour side! O Saint! The vicious Daitya, hearing the above words and deluded\n\n\n\np. 1050\n\n\n\nby the Maya of the Devas, forsook the Gayatri Mantra out of vanity and\ntherefore he became weak, bereft of the Holy Fire.\n\n\n\n78-85. Then Brihaspati, having succeeded in his work there, went to the\nHeavens and saw Indra and told him everything in detail. The Devas became\nsatisfied and worshipped the Highest Deity. O Muni! Thus, a long interval\npassed, when one day the World Mother, the Auspicious Devi appeared before\nthem. She was resplendent with the brilliance of ten million suns and looked\nbeautiful like ten millions of Kandarpas (Gods of love). Her body was anointed\nwith variegated colours, etc.; She wore a pair of clothings; a wonderful\ngarland suspended from Her neck; Her body was decked with various ornaments\nand in the fists of Her hands there were wonderful rows of hornets ( large\nblack bees). Her one hand was ready to grant boons and Her other hand was\nready to hold out \xc2\x93no fear.\xc2\x94 On the neck of Bhagavati, the Ocean of Mercy, and\npeaceful, were seen the variegated garlands with large black bees all round.\nThose male and female bees singing incessantly all round Her the Hrimkara\nMantra (the First Vibration of Force), kotis of black bees surrounded Her. The\nAll-auspicious Bhagavati, praised by all the Vedas, Who is all in all,\ncomposed of all, Who is all good, the Mother of all, Omniscient, the\nProtectress of all, was adorned fully with dress.\n\n\n\n86-96. Seeing suddenly the Devi, in their front Brahma and the other Devas\nbecame surprised and by and by they got relieved and gladly began to chant\nhymns of praise to Bhagavati, Whose Glories have been written in the Vedas.\n\n\n\nThe Devas said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! Obeisance to Thee! Thou art the Highest Knowledge\nand the Creatrix, Preservrix and the Destructrix of the Universe. O Thou, the\nLotus-eyed! Thou art the Refuge of all! So we bow down to Thee. O Devi! Thou\nart collectively and individually Vis'va, Taijasa, Praj\xc3\xb1a, Vira _t_ and\nSutratma. O Bhagavati. Thou art differentiated and undifferentiated; Thou art\nthe Ku _t_ astha Chaitanya (the Unmoveable, Unchangeable Consciousness). So we\nbow down to Thee. O Durge! Thou art unconcerned with the creation,\npreservation and destruction; yet Thou punishest the wicked and art easily\navailable by the sincere devotion of Thy Bhaktas. O Devi! Thou scorchest and\ndestroyest the ignorance and sin of the embodied souls. Hence Thou art named\nBharga. So we bow down to Thee. O Mother! Thou art Kalika, Nila Sarasvati,\nUgra Tara, Mahogra; Thou assumest many other forms. So we always bow down to\nThee. O Devi! Thou art Tripura Sundari, Bhairabi, Matangi, Dhumavati, Chhi\n_nn_ amasta, S'akambhari and Rakta Dantika. Obeisance to Thee! O Bhagavati! It\nis Thou that didst appear as Lak _s_ mi out of\n\n\n\np. 1051\n\n\n\nthe milk ocean (K _s_ ira Samudra). Thou hadst destroyed Vritrasura, Cha _nd_\na, Mu _nd_ a, Dhumralochana, Rakta Bija, S\xc2\x92umbha, Nis'umbha and the\nExterminator of the Danavas and thus, Thou didst do great favours to the\nDevas. So, O Gracious Countenanced! Thou art Vijaya and Ganga; O Sarade! We\nbow down to Thee. O Devi! Thou art the earth, fire, Pra _n_ a and other Vayus\nand other substances. O Merciful! Thou art of the form of this Universe; the\nDeva form, and the Moon, Sun and other Luminous forms and of the Knowledge\nForm.\n\n\n\n97-109. O Devi! Thou art Savitri; Thou art Gayatri; Thou art Sarasvati; Thou\nart Svadha, Svaha, and Dak _s_ i _n_ a. So we bow down to Thee. Thou art, in\nthe Vedas, the \xc3\x82gamas, \xc2\x93Not this, not this.\xc2\x94 Thou art what is left after the\nnegation of all this. This all the Vedas declare of Thy True Nature thus as\nthe Absolute Consciousness in all. Thus Thou art the Highest Deity. So we\nworship Thee. As Thou art surrounded by large black bees, Thou art named\nBhramari. We always make obeisance to Thee! Obeisance to Thee! Obeisance to\nThy sides! Obeisance to Thy back! Obeisance to Thy front! O Mother! Obeisance\nto Thy above! Obeisance to Thy below! Obeisance to everywhere round of Thee! O\nThou, the Dweller in Ma _n_ i Dvipa! O Maha Devi! Thou art the Guide of the\ninnumerable Brahma _nd_ as! O World Mother! Let Thou be merciful to us. O\nDevi! Thou art higher than the highest. O World Mother! Victory be to Thee!\nAll Hail! O Goddess of the universe! Thou art the Best in the whole universe;\nVictory to Thee! O Lady of the world! Thou art the mine of all the gems of\nqualities. O Parames'vari! O World Mother! Let Thou be pleased unto us.\xc2\x94\nNaraya _n_ a said :-- Hearing those sweet, ready and confident words of the\nDevas, the World Mother said in the sweet tone of a Mad Cuckoo:-- \xc2\x93O Devas! As\nfar as granting boons to others is concerned, I am ever ready. I am always\npleased with you. So, O Devas! Say what you want.\xc2\x94 Hearing the words of the\nDevi, the Devas began to express the cause of their sorrows. They informed Her\nof the wicked nature of the vicious Daitya, the neglect of the Devas, the\nBrahma _n_ as and the Vedas and the ruins thereof, and the dispossession of\nthe Devas of their abodes and the receiving by the Daitya of the boon from\nBrahma; in fact, everything what they had to say, duly and vigorously. Then\nthe Bhagavati Bhramari Devi sent out all sorts of black bees, hornets, etc.,\nfrom Her sides, front and forepart.\n\n\n\np. 1052\n\n\n\n110-120. Innumerable lines of black bees then were generated and they joined\nthemselves with those that got out of the Devi's hands and thus they covered\nthe whole earth. Thus countless bees began to emit from all sides like\nlocusts. The sky was overcast with the bees; and the earth was covered with\ndarkness. The sky, mountain peaks, trees, forests all became filled with bees\nand the spectacle presented a grand dismal sight. Then the black bees began to\ntear asunder the breasts of the Daityas as the bees bite those who destroy\ntheir beehives. Thus the Daityas could not use their weapons nor could they\nfight nor exchange any words. Nothing they could do; they had no help but to\ndie. The Daityas remained in the same state where they were and in that state\nthey wondered and died. No one could talk with another. Thus the principal\nDaityas died within an instant. Thus completing their destruction, the bees\ncame back to the Devi. All the people then spoke to one another \xc2\x93Oh! What a\nwonder! Oh! What a wonder!\xc2\x94 Or like this :-- \xc2\x93Whose Maya is this! What a\nwonder that She will do like this!\xc2\x94 Thus Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'a became\nmerged in the ocean of joy and worshipped the Devi Bhagavati with various\nofferings and shoutings of chants \xc2\x93Victory to the Devi\xc2\x94 and showered flowers\nall around. The Munis began to recite the Vedas. The Gandharbas began to sing.\n\n\n\n121-127. The various musical instruments, Mridangas, Murajas, the Indian\nlutes, Dhakkas, Damarus, S'ankhas, bells, etc., all sounded and the three\nworlds were filled with their echoes. All with folded palms chanted various\nhymns of praise to the Devi and said \xc2\x93O Mother! \xc3\x8esani! Victory to Thee!\xc2\x94 The\nMaha Devi became glad and gave to each separate boons and when they asked \xc2\x93for\nunshakeable devotion to Thy lotus feet,\xc2\x94 She granted them that also and\ndisappeared before them. Thus I have described to you the glorious character\nof the Bhramari Devi. If anybody hears this very wonderful anecdote, he\ncrosses at once this ocean of the world. Along with the glories and greatness\nof the Devi, if one hears the accounts of Manus, then all auspiciousness comes\nto him. He who hears or recites daily this Greatness of the Devi, becomes\nfreed from all his sins and he gets himself absorbed in the thoughts of the\nDevi (Sajuya). Note :-- The Mantra is here not merely the Seed, the Spiritual\nPassword, but it connotes, besides the idea of the password, the \xc3\x82di First\nvibration and it exhibits the First Spiritual Form, endowed with the highest\nfeelings of Faith, Wisdom, Bliss and Joy, displayed with the grandest colours,\nstartling thrills, rapt enchanting\n\n\n\np. 1053\n\n\n\nsigns, gestures, and postures, the shooting forth of all powers, the sources\nof Siddhis, that cannot be ordinarily conceived in the worldly concerns. Their\nfaint echoes govern this mighty world. The Mantras are seated in the six\nchakras or plexuses or the six Laya centres in the spinal cord. Within these\nchakras, the transformations of the Tattvas take place. Some vanish. Some\nappear and so on. Remark :-- In this chapter we find clearly the mention of\nthe several names of the ten Das'a Maha Vidyas.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirteenth Chapter of the Tenth Book of the account of Bhramari\nDevi in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar\n_s_ i Veda Vyasa and here ends as well the Tenth Book.\n\n\n\n[The Tenth Book completed.]\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 1](bk11ch01.htm)\n\n"
