What then now? When [1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:1:1) will you take (us) as a\ndear father takes his son by both hands, O ye gods, for whom the sacred grass\nhas been trimmed [2](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:1:2)?\n\n2\\. Where now? On what errand of yours are you going, in heaven, not on earth\n[1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:2:1)? Where are your cows sporting?\n\n3\\. Where are your newest favours [1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:3:1), O Maruts?\nWhere the blessings? Where all delights?\n\n4\\. If you, sons of P _ri_ _s_ ni, were mortals, and your praiser an immortal\n[1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:4:1),--\n\n5\\. Then never [1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:5:1) should your praiser be unwelcome,\nlike a deer in pasture grass [2](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:5:2), nor should he go on\nthe path of Yama [3](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:5:3).\n\n6\\. Let not one sin [1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:6:1) after another, difficult to\nbe conquered, overcome us; may it depart [2](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:6:2) together\nwith greed.\n\n7\\. Truly they are terrible and powerful; even to the desert the Rudriyas\nbring rain that is never dried up [1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:7:1).\n\n8\\. The lightning lows like a cow, it follows as a mother follows after her\nyoung, when the shower (of the Maruts) has been let loose\n[1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:8:1).\n\n9\\. Even by day the Maruts create darkness with the water-bearing cloud\n[1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:9:1), when they drench the earth.\n\n10\\. Then from the shouting of the Maruts over the whole space of the earth\n[1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:10:1), men reeled forward.\n\n11\\. Maruts on your strong-hoofed never-wearying [3](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:11:3)\n\np. 82\n\nsteeds [1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:11:1) go after those bright ones (the clouds),\nwhich are still locked up [2](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:11:2).\n\n12\\. May your fellies be strong, the chariots, and their horses, may your\nreins [1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:12:1) be well-fashioned.\n\n13\\. Speak forth for ever with thy voice to praise the Lord of prayer\n[1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:13:1), Agni, who is like a friend\n[2](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:13:2), the bright one.\n\n14\\. Fashion a hymn in thy mouth! Expand like the cloud\n[1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:14:1)! Sing a song of praise.\n\n15\\. Worship the host of the Maruts, the terrible. . the glorious, the musical\n[1](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:15:1). May they be magnified here among us\n[2](sbe3219.htm#an_1:38:15:2).\n\np. 83\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Ka _n_ va, the son of Ghora. The metre is Gayatri\nthroughout. Several verses, however, end in a spondee instead of the usual\niambus. No attempt should be made to improve such verses by conjecture, for\nthey are clearly meant to end in spondees. Thus in verses 2, 7, 8, and 9, all\nthe three padas alike have their final spondee. In verse 7, the ionicus a\nminore is with an evident intention repeated thrice. No verse of the hymn\noccurs in SV., VS., AV.; but verse 8 = TS. III, 1, 11, 5; verse 9 = TS. II, 4,\n8, 1.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Kadha-priya _h_ is taken in the Padapa _th_ a as one word, and Saya\n_n_ a explains it by delighted by or delighting in praise, a nominative\nplural. A similar compound, kadhapriya, occurs in I, 30, 20, and there too the\nvocative sing. fem., kadhapriye, is explained by Saya _n_ a as fond of praise.\nIn order to obtain this meaning, kadha has to be identified with katha, story,\nwhich is simply impossible. There is another compound, adha-priya, nom. dual,\nwhich occurs VIII, 8, 4, and which Saya _n_ a explains either as delighted\nhere below, or as a corruption of kadha-priya.\n\nIn Boehtlingk and Roth's Dictionary, kadha-priya and kadha-pri are both taken\nas compounds of kadha, an interrogative adverb, and priya or pri, to love or\ndelight, and they are explained as meaning kind or loving to whom? In the same\nmanner adha-priya is explained as kind then and there.\n\nIt must be confessed, however, that a compound like kadha-pri, kind to whom?,\nis somewhat strange, and it seems preferable to separate the words, and to\nwrite kadha priya and adha priya.\n\nIt should be observed that the compounds kadha-pri and kadha-priya occur\nalways in sentences where there is another interrogative pronoun. The two\ninterrogatives kat--kadha, what--where, and kas--kadha, who--where, occurring\nin the same sentence, an idiom so common in\n\np. 84\n\n[paragraph continues] Greek, may have puzzled the author of the Pada text, and\nthe compound being once sanctioned by the authority of Sakalya, Saya _n_ a\nwould explain it as best he could. But if we admit the double use of the\ninterrogative in Sanskrit, as in Greek, then, in our passage, priya _h_ would\nbe an adjective belonging to pita\xc2\xb4, and we might translate: 'What then now?\nWhen will you take (us), as a dear father takes his son by both hands, O ye\nMaruts?' In the same manner we ought to translate I, 30, 20:\n\nka _h_ te usha _h_ kadha priye bhu _g_ e marta _h_ amartye.\n\nWho and where was there a mortal to be loved by thee, O beloved, immortal\nDawn?\n\nIn VIII, 7, 31, where the same words are repeated as in our passage, it is\nlikewise better to write:\n\nkat ha nunam kadha priya _h_ yat indram a _g_ ahatana, ka _h_ va _h_ sakhi-tve\nohate.\n\nWhat then now? Where is there a friend, now that you have forsaken Indra? Who\nwatches for your friendship?\n\nWhy in VIII, 8, 4, adha priya should have been joined into one word is more\ndifficult to say, yet here, too, the compound might easily be separated.\n\nKadha does not occur again, but would be formed in analogy with adha. It\noccurs in Zend as kadha.\n\nKuhn, Beitrage IV, p. 186, has shown that kush _th_ a _h_ (RV. V, 74, 1) is a\nsimilar monster, and stands for ku sh _th_ a _h_.\n\nThe words kat ha nunam commonly introduce an interrogative sentence,\nliterally, What then now? cf. X, 10, 4.\n\nNote 2. V _ri_ kta-barhis is generally a name of the priest, so called because\nhe has to trim the sacrificial grass. 'The sacred Ku _s_ a grass (Poa\ncynosuroides), after having had the roots cut off, is spread on the Vedi or\naltar, and upon it the libation of Soma-juice, or oblation of clarified\nbutter, is poured out. In other places, a tuft of it in a similar position is\nsupposed to form a fitting seat for the deity or deities invoked to the\nsacrifice. According to Mr. Stevenson, it is also strewn over the floor of the\nchamber in which the worship is performed.'\n\nCf. VI, II, 5. v _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ e ha yat namasa barhi _h_ agnau, ayami sruk gh\n_ri_ ta-vati su-v _ri_ kti _h_.\n\np. 85\n\nWhen I reverentially trim the truss for Agni, when the well-trimmed ladle,\nfull of butter, is stretched forth.\n\nIn our passage, unless we change the accent, it must be taken as an epithet of\nthe Maruts, they for whom the grass-altar has been prepared. They are again\ninvoked by the same name, VIII, 7, 20:\n\nkva\xcc\x83 nunam su-danava _h_ madatha v _ri_ kta-barhisha _h_.\n\nWhere do ye rejoice now, you gods for whom the altar is trimmed?\n\nOtherwise, v _ri_ kta-barhisha _h_ might, with a change of accent, supply an\naccusative to dadhidhve: 'Will you take the worshippers in your arms?' This,\nthough decidedly better, is not absolutely necessary, because to take by the\nhand may be used as a neuter verb.\n\nWilson: Maruts, who are fond of praise, and for whom the sacred grass is\ntrimmed, when will you take us by both hands as a father does his son?\n\nBenfey: Wo weilt ihr gern? was habt ihr jetzt--gleichwie ein Vater seinen Sohn\n--in Handen, da das Opfer harrt?\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The idea of the first verse, that the Maruts should not be detained by\nother pursuits, is carried on in the second. The poet asks, what they have to\ndo in the sky, instead of coming down to the earth. The last sentence seems to\nmean ' where tarry your herds?' viz. the clouds. Saya _n_ a translates: 'Where\ndo worshippers, like lowing cows, praise you?' Wilson: 'Where do they who\nworship you cry to you, like cattle?' Benfey: 'Wo jauchzt man euch, gleich wie\nStiere? (Ihre Verehrer brullen vor Freude uber ihre Gegenwart, wie Stiere.)'\nThe verb ra _n_ yati, however, when followed by an accusative, means to love,\nto accept with pleasure. The gods accept the offerings and the prayers:\n\nV, 18, 1. vi _s_ vani ya _h_ amartya _h_ havya\xc2\xb4 marteshu ra _n_ yati.\n\nThe immortal who deigns to accept all offerings among mortals.\n\nV, 74, 3. kasya brahma _n_ i ra _n_ yatha _h_.\n\np. 86\n\nWhose prayers do ye accept?\n\nFollowed by a locative ra _n_ yati means to delight in. Both the gods are said\nto delight in prayers (VIII, 12, 18; 33, 16), and prayers are said to delight\nin the gods (VIII, 16, 2). I therefore take ra _n_ yanti in the sense of\ntarrying, disporting, and na, if it is to be retained, in the sense of not;\nwhere do they not sport? meaning that they are to be found everywhere, except\nwhere the poet desires them to be. We thus get rid of the simile of singing\npoets and lowing cows, which, though not too bold for Vedic bards, would here\ncome in too abruptly. It would be much better, however, if the negative\nparticle could be omitted altogether. If we retain it, we must read: kva\xcc\x83 va\n_h_ | gava _h_ | na ra _n_ yanti | . But the fact is that through the whole of\nthe Rig-veda kva\xcc\x83 has always to be pronounced as two syllables, kuva. There is\nonly one passage, V, 61, 2, where, before a vowel, we have to read kva: kuva\nvo ' _s_ va _h_ , kvabhi _s_ ava _h_. In other passages, even before vowels,\nwe always have to read kuva, e. g. I, 161, 4. kuvet = kva it; I, 105, 4.\nkuvartam = kva _ri_ tam. In I, 35, 7, we must read either kuvedanim surya _h_\n, making surya _h_ trisyllabic, or kuva idanim, leaving a hiatus. In I, 168,\n6, kvavaram is kuvavaram: _S_ akalya, forgetting this, and wishing to improve\nthe metre, added na, thereby, in reality, destroying both the metre and the\nsense. Kva occurs as dissyllabic in the Rig-veda at least forty-one times.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The meanings of sumna, in the first five Ma _n_ _d_ alas are well\nexplained by Professor Aufrecht in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. iv, p. 274. As to\nsuvita\xc2\xb4 in the plural, see X, 86, 21, and VIII, 93, 29, where Indra is said to\nbring all suvitas. It frequently occurs in the singular:\n\nX, 148, 1. a\xc2\xb4 na _h_ bhara suvitam yasya _k_ akan.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. One might translate: 'If you, sons of P _ri_ _s_ ni, were mortals, the\nimmortal would be your worshipper.' But this seems almost too deep and\nelaborate a compliment for a primitive age. Langlois translates: 'Quand vous\nne\n\np. 87\n\nseriez pas immortels, (faites toutefois) que votre panegyriste jouisse d'une\nlongue vie.' Wilson's translation is obscure: 'That you, sons of P _ri_ _s_\nni, may become mortals, and your panegyrist become immortal.' Saya _n_ a\ntranslates: 'Though you, sons of P _ri_ _s_ ni, were mortal, yet your\nworshipper would be immortal.' Ludwig has, 'Wenn ihr, o kinder der P _ri_ _s_\nni, sterbliche waret, der unsterbliche ware euer sanger dann. Nicht werde euch\nunlieb der sanger, wie ein wildes tier auf der weide, nicht des Yama Pfad\nbetrete er.' I think it best to connect the fourth and fifth verses, and I\nfeel justified in so doing by other passages where the same or a similar idea\nis expressed, viz. that if the god were the poet and the poet the god, then\nthe poet would be more liberal to the god than the god is to him. Whether syat\nshould have the udatta, I cannot tell. Thus I translated a passage, VII, 32,\n18, in my History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 545: 'If I were lord of\nas much as thou, I should support the sacred bard, thou scatterer of wealth, I\nshould not abandon him to misery. I should award wealth day by day to him who\nmagnifies, I should award it to whosoever it be.' Another parallel passage is\npointed out by Mr. J. Muir, (On the Interpretation of the Veda, p. 79; see\nalso Sanskrit Texts, V, 303.) VIII, 19, 25: 'If, Agni, thou wert a mortal, and\nI were an immortal, I should not abandon thee to malediction or to\nwretchedness; my worshipper should not be miserable or distressed.' Still more\nto the point is another passage, VIII, 44, 23: 'If I were thou, and thou wert\nI, then thy wishes should be fulfilled.' See also VIII, 14, 1, 2.\n\nAs to the metre it is clear that we ought to read ma\xcc\x84rt\xcc\x84a\xcc\x86sa\xcc\x84 _h_ sy\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Ma\xc2\xb4, though it seems to stand for na, retains its prohibitive sense.\n\nNote 2. Yavasa is explained by Saya _n_ a as grass, and Wilson's Dictionary,\ntoo, gives to it the meaning of meadow or pasture grass, whereas yava is\nbarley. The Greek \xce\xb6\xce\xb5\xce\xac or \xce\xb6\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xac is likewise explained as barley or rye, fodder\nfor horses. See I, 91, 13. ga\xc2\xb4va _h_ na yavaseshu, like cows in meadows.\n\np. 88\n\nNote 3. The path of Yama can only be the path first followed by Yama, or that\nleads to Yama, as the ruler of the departed.\n\nX, 14, 8. sam ga _k_ _kh_ asva pit _r i_-bhi _h_ sam yamena.\n\nMeet with the fathers, meet with Yama (X, 14, 10; 15, 8).\n\nX, 14, 7. yamam pa _s_ yasi varu _n_ am _k_ a devam.\n\nThou wilt see (there) Yama and the divine Varu _n_ a.\n\nX, 165, 4. tasmai yama\xc2\xb4ya nama _h_ astu m _ri_ tyave.\n\nAdoration to that Yama, to Death!\n\nWilson: Never may your worshipper be indifferent to you, as a deer (is never\nindifferent) to pasture, so that he may not tread the path of Yama.\n\nBenfey: Wer euch besingt, der sei euch nicht gleichgultig, wie das Wild im\nGras, nicht wandl' er auf des Yama Pfad.\n\n\xc3\x81 _g_ oshya is translated insatiable by Professor Goldstucker.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. One of the meanings of nir _ri_ ti is sin. It is derived from the same\nroot which yielded _ri_ ta, in the sense of right. Nir _ri_ ti was conceived,\nit would seem, as going away from the path of right, the German Vergehen. Nir\n_ri_ ti was personified as a power of evil and destruction.\n\nVII, 104, 9. ahaye va ta\xc2\xb4n pra-dadatu soma _h_ a\xc2\xb4 va dadhatu ni _h_ - _ri_ te\n_h_ upa-sthe.\n\nMay Soma hand them over to Ahi, or place them in the lap of Nir _ri_ ti.\n\nI, 117, 5. susupva\xc2\xb4 _m_ sam na ni _h_ - _ri_ te _h_ upa-sthe.\n\nLike one who sleeps in the lap of Nir _ri_ ti.\n\nHere Saya _n_ a explains Nir _ri_ ti as earth, and he attaches the same\nmeaning to the word in other places which will have to be considered\nhereafter. Cf. Lectures on the Science of Language, Second Series, p. 562.\n\nWilson treats Nir _ri_ ti as a male deity, and translates the last words, 'let\nhim perish with our evil desires.'\n\nNote 2. Padish _t_ a is formed as an optative of the \xc3\x82tmanepada, but with the\nadditional s before the t, which, in the ordinary Sanskrit, is restricted to\nthe so-called benedictive (Grammar, \xc2\xa7 385; Bopp, Kritische Grammatik, ed.\n1834,\n\np. 89\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc2\xa7 329, note). Pad means originally to go. Thus RV. IX,\n73, 9, atra kartam ava padati aprabhu _h_ , may the impotent go down into the\npit. In certain constructions it gradually assumed the meaning of to perish,\nand native commentators are inclined to explain it by pat, to fall. One can\nwatch the transition of meaning from going into perishing in such phrases as\nVS. XI, 46, ma pady ayusha _h_ pura, literally, 'may he not go before the\ntime,' but really intended for 'may he not die before the time.' In the Rig-\nveda padish _t_ a is generally qualified by some words to show that it is to\nbe taken in malam partem. Thus in our passage, and in III, 53, 21; VII, 104,\n16; 17. In I, 79, 11, however, padish _t_ a sa _h_ is by itself used in a\nmaledictory sense, pereat, may he perish! In another, VI, 20, 5, pa\xc2\xb4di by\nitself conveys the idea of perishing. This may have some weight in determining\nthe origin of the Latin pestis (Corssen, Kritische Beitrage, p. 396), for it\nshows that, even without prepositions, such as a or vi, pad may have an ill-\nomened meaning. In the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a VII, 14 (History of Ancient\nSanskrit Literature, p. 471), pad, as applied to a child's teeth, means to go,\nto fall out. With sam, however, pad has always a good meaning, and this shows\nthat originally its meaning was neutral. Another translation, suggested by\nLudwig, might be: 'Let not one dreadful Nir _ri_ ti (sin) after another strike\nus.'\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The only difficult word is avata\xc2\xb4m. Saya _n_ a explains it, 'without\nwind.' But it is hardly possible to understand how the Maruts, themselves the\ngods of the storm, the sons of Rudra, could be said to bring clouds without\nwind. Langlois, it is true, translates without any misgivings: 'Ces dieux\npeuvent sur un sol desseche faire tomber la pluie sans l'accompagner de vent.'\nWilson: 'They send down rain without wind upon the desert.' Benfey saw the\nincongruous character of the epithet, and explained it away by saying that the\nwinds bring rain, and after they have brought it, they moderate their violence\nin order not to drive it away again; hence rain without wind. Yet even\n\np. 90\n\nthis explanation, though ingenious, and, as I am told, particularly truthful\nin an eastern climate, is somewhat too artificial. If we changed the accent,\navatam, unchecked, unconquered, would be better than avata\xc2\xb4m, windless. But\navata, unconquered, does not occur in the Rig-veda, except as applied to\npersons. It occurs most frequently in the phrase vanvan avata _h_ , which Saya\n_n_ a explains well by hi _m_ san ahi _m_ sita _h_ , hurting, but not hurt:\n(VI, 16, 20; 18, 1; IX, 89, 7.) In IX, 96, 8, we read p _ri_ t-su vanvan avata\n_h_ , in battles attacking, but not attacked, which renders the meaning of\navata perfectly clear. In VI, 64, 5, where it is applied to Ushas, it may be\ntranslated by unconquerable, intact.\n\nThere are several passages, however, where avata occurs with the accent on the\nlast syllable, and where it is accordingly explained as a Bahuvrihi, meaning\neither windless or motionless, from vata, wind, or from vata, going. (I, 62,\n10). In some of these passages we can hardly doubt that the accent ought to be\nchanged, and that we ought to read avata. Thus in VI, 64, 4, avate is clearly\na vocative applied to Ushas, who is called avata, unconquerable, in the verse\nimmediately following. In I, 52, 4, the Maruts are called avata _h_ , which\ncan only be avata _h_ , unconquerable; nor can we hesitate in VIII, 79, 7, to\nchange avata _h_ into avata _h_ , as an epithet applied to Soma, and preceded\nby ad _ri_ ptakratu _h_ , of unimpaired strength, unconquerable.\n\nBut even then we find no evidence that avata, unconquered, could be applied to\nrain or to a cloud, and I therefore propose another explanation, though\nequally founded on the supposition that the accent of avatam in our passage\nshould be on the first syllable.\n\nI take vata as a Vedic form instead of the later vana, the past participle of\nvai, to wither. Similarly we find in the Veda _g_ ita, instead of _g_ ina, the\nlatter form being sanctioned by Pa _n_ ini. Va means to get dry, to flag, to\nget exhausted; avata therefore, as applied to a cloud, would mean not dry, not\nwithered, as applied to rain, not dried up, but remaining on the ground. It is\nimportant to remark that in one passage, VI, 67, 7, Saya _n_ a, too, explains\navata, as applied to rivers, by a _s_ ushka, not dry; and the same meaning\nwould\n\np. 91\n\nbe applicable to avata\xc2\xb4 _h_ in I, 62, 10. In this sense of not withered, not\ndry, avatam in our passage would form a perfectly appropriate epithet of the\nrain, while neither windless nor unconquered would yield an appropriate sense.\nIn the famous passage, X, 129, 2, a\xc2\xb4nit avatam svadhaya tat ekam, that only\nOne breathed breathless by itself, avatam might be taken, in accordance with\nits accent, as windless or breathless, and the poet may have wished to give\nthis antithetical point to his verse. But avatam, as an adverb, would here be\nequally appropriate, and we should then have to translate, 'that only One\nbreathed freely by itself.' Ludwig translates, 'Als treue die blendenden, die\nsturmenden Rudriya auf oder flache sogar, als brunnen die wolke schaffen.'\nThis presupposes the conjectural reading avatam.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The peculiar structure of the metre in the seventh and eighth verses\nshould be noted. Though we may scan\n\n  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  |    \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  |    \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86\n\xcc\x86\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  |  \n  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  |    \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  |    \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86\n\xcc\x86\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84\n\nby throwing the accent on the short antepenultimate, yet the movement of the\nmetre becomes far more natural by throwing the accent on the long penultimate,\nthus reading\n\n  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  |    \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  |    \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81\n\xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \n  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  |    \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  |    \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81\n\xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x81  \xcc\x84\n\nSaya _n_ a: Like a cow the lightning roars, (the lightning) attends (on the\nMaruts) as the mother cow on her calf, because their rain is let loose at the\ntime of lightning and thunder.\n\nWilson: The lightning roars like a parent cow that bellows for its calf, and\nhence the rain is set free by the Maruts.\n\nBenfey: Es blitzt--wie eine Kuh brullt es--die Mutter folgt dem Kalb gleichsam\n--wenn ihr Regen losgelassen. (Der Donner folgt dem Blitz, wie eine Kuh ihrem\nKalbe.)\n\nVa _s_ ra as a masculine means a bull, and it is used as a name of the Maruts\nin some passages, VIII, 7, 3; 7. As\n\np. 92\n\na feminine it means a cow, particularly a cow with a calf, a milch cow. Hence\nalso a mother, X, 119, 4. The lowing of the lightning must be intended for the\ndistant thunder, and the idea that the lightning goes near or looks for the\nrain is not foreign to the Vedic poets. See I, 39, 9: 'Come to us, Maruts,\nwith your entire help, as lightnings (come to, i. e. seek for) the rain!'\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. That par _g_ anya here and in other places means cloud has been well\nillustrated by Dr. Bailer, Orient and Occident, vol. i, p. 221. It is\ninteresting to watch the personifying process which is very palpable in this\nword, and by which Par _g_ anya becomes at last a friend and companion of\nIndra. See now, 'India, what can it teach us?' p. 183 seq.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Sadma, as a neuter, means originally a seat, and is frequently used in\nthe sense of altar: IV, 9, 3. sa _h_ sadma pari niyate hota; VII, 18, 22.\nhota-iva sadma pari emi rebhan. It soon, however, assumed the more general\nmeaning of place, as\n\nX, 1, 1. agni _h_ bhanuna ru _s_ ata vi _s_ va sadmani apra _h_.\n\nAgni with brilliant light thou filledst all places.\n\nIt is lastly used with special reference to heaven and earth, the two sadmani,\nI, 185, 6; III, 55, 2. In our passage sadma pa\xc2\xb4rthivam is the same as\npa\xc2\xb4rthive sadane in VIII, 97, 5. Here the earth is mentioned together with\nheaven, the sea, and the sky. Saya _n_ a takes sadma as 'dwelling,' so do\nWilson and Langlois. Benfey translates 'der Erde Sitz,' and makes it the\nsubject of the sentence, which may be right: 'From the roaring of the Maruts\nthe seat of the earth trembles, and all men tremble.' Sadman, with the accent\non the last syllable, is also used as a masculine in the Rig-veda, I, 173, I;\nVI, 51, 12. sadma\xc2\xb4nam divyam.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. I have translated vi _l_ u-pa _n_ ibhi _h_ , as if it were vi _l_ upa\n_n_ ibhi _h_ , for this is the right accent of a Bahuvrihi\n\np. 93\n\ncompound. Thus the first member retains its own accent in p _ri_ thu-pa _n_ i,\nbhu\xc2\xb4ri-pa _n_ i v _r i_sha-pa _n_ i, &c. It is possible that the accent may\nhave been changed in our passage, because the compound is used, not as an\nadjective, but as a kind of substantive, as the name of a horse. Pa _n_ i,\nhand, means, as applied to horses, hoof:\n\nII, 31, 2. p _ri_ thivya\xc2\xb4 _h_ sa\xc2\xb4nau _g_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ghananta pa _n_ i-bhi _h_.\n\nWhen they strike with their hoofs on the summit of the earth.\n\nThis meaning appears still more clearly in such compounds as dravat-pa _n_ i:\n\nVIII, 5, 35. hira _n_ yaye _n_ a rathena dravatpa _n_ i-bhi _h_ a _s_ vai _h_.\n\nOn a golden chariot, on quick-hoofed horses.\n\nThe horses of the Maruts, which in our verse are called vi _l_ u-pa _n_ i,\nstrong-hoofed, are called VIII, 7, 27. hira _n_ yapa _n_ i, golden-hoofed:\n\na _s_ vai _h_ hira _n_ yapa _n_ i-bhi _h_ devasa _h_ upa gantana.\n\nOn your golden-hoofed horses come hither, O gods.\n\nThose who retain the accent of the MSS. ought to translate, 'Maruts, with your\nstrong hands go after the clouds.'\n\nNote 2. Rodhasvati is explained by Saya _n_ a as river. It does not occur\nagain in the Rig-veda. Rodhas is enclosure or fence, the bank of a river; but\nit does not follow that rodhasvat, having enclosures or banks, was applicable\nto rivers only. II, 15, 8, it is said that he emptied or opened the artificial\nenclosures of Bala, these being the clouds conquered by Indra. Hence I take\nrodhasvati in the sense of a cloud yet unopened, which is followed or driven\non by the Maruts.\n\n_K_ itra, bright or many-coloured, is applied to the clouds, V, 63, 3. _k_\nitrebhi _h_ abhrai _h_.\n\nNote 3. Roth and Ludwig take akhidrayaman for a name of horse, which seems\nright. The word does not occur again in the Rig-veda.\n\nWilson: Maruts, with strong hands, come along the beautifully-embanked rivers\nwith unobstructed progress.\n\nBenfey: Mit euren starken Handen folgt den hehren eingeschlossnen nach in\nunermud'tem Gang, Maruts.\n\np. 94\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. Abhi\xc2\xb4 _s_ u, rein, does not mean finger in the Rig-veda, though Saya\n_n_ a frequently explains it so, misled by Yaska, who gives abhi _s_ u among\nthe names of finger. Wilson: 'May your fingers be well skilled (to hold the\nreins).'\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. Agni is frequently invoked together with the Maruts, and is even\ncalled marut-sakha, the friend of the Maruts, VIII, 92, 14. It seems better,\ntherefore, to refer brahma _n_ as patim to Agni, than, with Saya _n_ a, to the\nhost of the Maruts (marudga _n_ am). Brahma _n_ aspati and B _r i_haspati are\nboth varieties of Agni, the priest and purohita of gods and men, and as such\nhe is invoked together with the Maruts in other passages, I, 40, I. Tana is an\nadverb. meaning constantly, always, for ever. Cf. II, 2, I; VIII. 40, 7.\n\nWilson: Declare in our presence (priests), with voice attuned to praise Brahma\n_n_ aspati, Agni, and the beautiful Mitra.\n\nBenfey: Lass schallen immerfort das Lied zu grussen Brahma _n_ aspati, Agni,\nMitra, den herrlichen.\n\nNote 2. Mitra is never, as far as I know, invoked together with the Maruts,\nand it is better to take mitram as friend. Besides na cannot be left here\nuntranslated. Ludwig translates, 'beautiful like Mitra,' that is, bright like\nthe sun.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. The second sentence is obscure. Saya _n_ a translates: 'Let the choir\nof priests make a hymn of praise, let them utter or expand it, like as a cloud\nsends forth rain.' Wilson similarly: Utter the verse that is in your mouth,\nspread it out like a cloud spreading rain.' Benfey: 'Ein Preislied schaffe in\ndem Mund, ertone dem Par _g_ anya gleich.' He takes Par _g_ anya for the god\nof thunder, and supposes the hymn of praise to be compared to it on account of\nits loudness. Tatana _h_ can only be the second person singular of the\nconjunctive of the reduplicated perfect, of which we\n\np. 95\n\nhave also tatanat, tatanama, tatanan, and tatananta. Tatana _h_ can be\naddressed either to the host of the Maruts, or to the poet. I take it in the\nlatter sense, for a similar verse occurs VIII, 21, 18. It is said there of a\npatron that he alone is a king, that all others about the river Sarasvati are\nonly small kings, and the poet adds: 'May he spread like a cloud with the\nrain,' giving hundreds and thousands (par _g_ anya _h_ -iva tatanat hi v _ri_\nsh _t_ ya\xc2\xb4). Ludwig takes tan in the sense of thundering; thunder like Par _g_\nanya!\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. It is difficult to find an appropriate rendering for arkin. It means\npraising, celebrating, singing, and it is in the last sense only that it is\napplicable to the Maruts. Wilson translates, 'entitled to adoration;' Benfey,\n'flaming.' Boehtlingk and Roth admit the sense of flaming in one passage, but\ngive to arkin in this place the meaning of praising. If it simply meant,\npossessed of arka, i. e. songs of praise, it would be a very lame epithet\nafter panasyu. But other passages, like I, 19, 4; 52, 15, show that the\nconception of the Maruts as singers was most familiar to the Vedic _Ri_ shis\n(I, 64, 10; Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. i, p. 521. note); and arka is the very\nname applied to their songs (I, 19, 4). In the Edda, too, 'storm and thunder\nare represented as a lay, as the wondrous music of the wild hunt. The dwarfs\nand Elbs sing the so-called Alb-leich which carries off everything, trees and\nmountains.' See Justi in Orient and Occident, vol. ii, p. 62; Genthe,\nWindgottheiten, p. 4; 11. There is no doubt therefore that arkin here means\nmusician, and that the arka of the Maruts is the music of the winds.\n\nNote 2. V _ri_ ddha, literally grown, is used in the Veda as an honorific\nepithet, with the meaning of mighty, great, or magnified:\n\nIII, 32, 7. ya _g_ ama _h_ it namasa v _ri_ ddham indram  \n           b _ri_ hantam _ri_ shvam a _g_ aram yuvanam.\n\nWe worship with praise the mighty Indra, the great, the exalted, the immortal,\nthe vigorous.\n\nHere neither is v _ri_ ddha intended to express old age,\n\np. 96\n\nnor yuvan young age, but both are meant as laudatory epithets. See\nDarmesteter, Ormazd et Ahriman, p. 91 seq.\n\nAsan is the so-called Le _t_ of as, to be. This Le _t_ is properly an\nimperative, which gradually sinks down to a mere subjunctive, and is generally\ncalled so. Of as, we find the following Le _t_ forms: belonging to the\npresent, we have asasi, II, 26, 2; asati, VI, 23, 9; asatha _h_ , VI, 63, 1;\nand asatha, V, 61, 4: belonging to the imperfect, asa _h_ , VIII, 100, 2;\nasat, I, 9, 5; asama, I, 173, 9; asan, I, 89, 1. \xc3\x81sam, a form quoted by Roth\nfrom Rig-veda X, 27, 4, is really a\xc2\xb4sam.\n\nWe find, for instance, asa _h_ , with an imperative or optative meaning, in\n\nVIII, 100, 2. asa _h_ _k_ a tvam dakshi _n_ ata _h_ sakha me  \n              adha v _ri_ tra\xc2\xb4 _n_ i a\xc2\xb4 ga\xe1\xb9\x85ghanava bhu\xc2\xb4ri.\n\nAnd be thou my friend on my right hand, and we shall kill many enemies.\n\nHere we see the transition of meaning from an imperative to the conditional.\nIn English, too, we may say, 'Do this and you shall live,' which means nearly\nthe same as, 'If you do this, you will live.' Thus we may translate this\npassage: 'And if thou be my friend on my right side, then we shall kill many\nenemies.'\n\nX, 124, I. imam na _h_ agne upa ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am a\xc2\xb4 ihi--  \n           asa _h_ havya-va\xc2\xb4 _t_ uta na _h_ pura _h_ -ga\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nHere we have the imperative ihi and the Le _t_ asa _h_ used in the same sense.\n\nFar more frequently, however, asa _h_ is used in relative sentences, such as,\n\nVI, 36, 5. asa _h_ yatha na _h_ _s_ avasa _k_ akana _h_.\n\nThat thou mayest be ours, delighting in strength.\n\nVII, 24, 1. asa _h_ yatha na _h_ avita\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ dhe _k_ a.\n\nThat thou mayest be our helper and for our increase.\n\nSee also X, 44, 4; 85, 26; 36.\n\nWilson: May they be exalted by this our worship.\n\nBenfey: Mogen die Hohen hier bei uns sein.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 39.
