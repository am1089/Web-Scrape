I.\n\nAccount of the several Manus and Manwantaras. Swarochisha the second Manu: the\ndivinities, the Indra, the seven Rishis of his period, and his sons. Similar\ndetails of Auttami, Tamasa, Raivata, Chakshusha, and Vaivaswata. The forms of\nVishn\xcc\x81u, as the preserver, in each Manwantara. The meaning of Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nMAITREYA.--The disposition of the earth and of the ocean, and the system of\nthe sun and the planets, the creation of the gods and the rest, the origin of\nthe Rishis, the generation of the four castes, the production of brute\ncreatures, and the narratives of Dhruva and Prahlada, have been fully related\nby thee, my venerable preceptor. I am now desirous to hear from you the series\nof all the Manwantaras, as well as an account of those who preside over the\nrespective periods, with \xc5\x9aakra, the king of the gods, at their head.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--I will repeat to you, Maitreya, in their order, the different\nManwantaras; those which are past, and those which are to come.\n\nThe first Manu was Swayambhuva, then came Swarochisha, then Auttami, then\nTamasa, then Raivata, then Chakshusha: these six Manus have passed away. The\nManu who presides over the seventh Manwantara, which is the present period, is\nVaivaswata, the son of the sun.\n\nThe period of Swayambhuva Manu, in the beginning of the Kalpa, has already\nbeen described by me, together with the gods, Rishis, and other personages,\nwho then flourished 1. I will now, therefore, enumerate\n\np. 260\n\nthe presiding gods, Rishis, and sons of the Manu, in the Manwantara of\nSwarochisha 2. The deities of this period (or the second Manwantara) were the\nclasses called Paravatas and Tushitas 3; and the king of the gods was the\nmighty Vipa\xc5\x9bchit. The seven Rishis 4 were \xc3\x9arja, Stambha,\n\np. 261\n\n[paragraph continues] Pran\xcc\x81a, Dattoli, Rishabha, Ni\xc5\x9bchara, and Arvarivat; and\nChaitra, Kimpurusha, and others, were the Manu\'s sons 5.\n\nIn the third period, or Manwantara of Auttami 6, Su\xc5\x9banti was the Indra, the\nking of the gods; the orders of whom were the Sudhamas, Satyas, \xc5\x9aivas,\n[Pradar\xc5\x9banas](errata.htm#10), and Vasavertis 7; each of the five orders\nconsisting of twelve divinities. The seven sons of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha were the seven\nRishis 8; and Aja, Para\xc5\x9bu, Divya, and others, were the sons of the Manu 9.\n\np. 262\n\nThe Surupas, Haris, Satyas, and \xc5\x9audhis 10 were the classes of gods, each\ncomprising twenty-seven, in the period of Tamasa, the fourth Manu 11. \xc5\x9aivi was\nthe Indra, also designated by his performance of a hundred sacrifices (or\nnamed \xc5\x9aatakratu). The seven Rishis were Jyotirdhama, Prithu, Kavya, Chaitra,\nAgni, Vanaka, and Pivara 12. The sons of Tamasa were the mighty kings Nara,\nKhyati, \xc5\x9aantahaya, Janujangha, and others 13.\n\nIn the fifth interval the Manu was Raivata 14: the Indra was Vibhu: the\nclasses of gods, consisting of fourteen each, were the Amitabhas,\nAbhutarajasas, Vaikunthas, and Sumedhasas 15: the seven Rishis were\n\np. 263\n\n[paragraph continues] Hiran\xcc\x81yaroma, Vedasri, Urddhabahu, Vedabahu, Sudhaman,\nParjanya, and Mahamuni 16: the sons of Raivata were Balabandhu, Susambhavya,\nSatyaka, and other valiant kings.\n\nThese four Manus, Swarochisha, Auttami, Tamasa, and Raivata, were all\ndescended from Priyavrata, who, in consequence of propitiating Vishn\xcc\x81u by his\ndevotions, obtained these rulers of the Manwantaras for his posterity.\n\nChakshusha was the Manu of the sixth period 17: in which the Indra was\nManojava: the five classes of gods were the \xc3\x81dyas, Prastutas, Bhavyas,\nPrithugas, and the magnanimous Lekhas, eight of each 18: Sumedhas, Virajas,\nHavishmat, Uttama, Madhu, Abhinaman, and Sahishn\xcc\x81u were the seven sages 19:\nthe kings of the earth, the sons of Chakshusha, were the powerful Uru, Puru,\n\xc5\x9aatadyumna, and others.\n\np. 264\n\nThe Manu of the present period is the wise lord of obsequies, the illustrious\noffspring of the sun: the deities are the \xc3\x81dityas, Vasus, and Rudras; their\nsovereign is Purandara: Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, Ka\xc5\x9byapa, Atri, Jamadagni, Gautama,\nVi\xc5\x9bwamitra, and Bharadwaja are the seven Rishis: and the nine pious sons of\nVaivaswata Manu are the kings Ikshwaku, Nabhaga, Dhrisht\xcc\x81a, Sanyati,\nNarishyanta, Nabhanidisht\xcc\x81a, Karusha, Prishadhra, and the celebrated Vasumat\n20.\n\nThe unequalled energy of Vishn\xcc\x81u combining with the quality of goodness, and\neffecting the preservation of created things, presides over all the\nManwantaras in the form of a divinity. Of a portion of that divinity Yajna was\nborn in the Swayambhuva Manwantara, the will-begotten progeny of \xc3\x81kuti 21.\nWhen the Swarochisha Manwantara had arrived, that divine Yajna was born as\nAjita, along with the Tushita gods, the sons of Tushita. In the third\nManwantara, Tushita was again born of Satya, as Satya, along with the class of\ndeities so denominated. In the next period, Satya became Hari, along with the\nHaris, the\n\np. 265\n\nchildren of Hari. The excellent Hari was again born in the Raivata Manwantara,\nof Sambhuti, as Manasa, along with the gods called Abhutarajasas. In the next\nperiod, Vishn\xcc\x81u was born of Vikunthi, as Vaikuntha, along with the deities\ncalled Vaikunthas. In the present Manwantara, Vishn\xcc\x81u was again born as\nVamana, the son of Ka\xc5\x9byapa by Aditi. With three paces he subdued the worlds,\nand gave them, freed from all embarrassment, to Purandara 22. These are the\nseven persons by whom, in the several Manwantaras, created beings have been\nprotected. Because this whole world has been pervaded by the energy of the\ndeity, he is entitled Vishn\xcc\x81u, from the root Vis, \'to enter\' or \'pervade;\' for\nall the gods, the Manus, the seven Rishis, the sons of the Manus, the Indras\nthe sovereigns of the gods, all are but the impersonated might of Vishn\xcc\x81u 23.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[259:1](vp075.htm#fr_743) The gods were said to be the Yamas ([p.\n54](vp041.htm#page_54)); the Rishis were Marichi, Angiras, &c. ([p.\n49](vp041.htm#page_49). n. [2](vp041.htm#fn_200)); and the sons were\nPriyavrata and Uttanapada ([p. 53](vp041.htm#page_53)). The Vayu adds to the\nYamas, the Ajitas, who share with the former, it observes, sacrificial p. 260\nofferings. The Matsya, Padma, Brahma P. and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba substitute for the\nsons, the grandsons of Swayambhuva, Agnidhra and the rest ([p.\n162](vp058.htm#page_162)).\n\n[260:2](vp075.htm#fr_744) This Manu, according to the legend of his birth in\nthe Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya P., was the son of Swarochish, so named from the splendour of\nhis appearance when born, and who was the son of the nymph Varuthini by the\nGandharba Kali. The text, in another place, makes him a son of Priyavrata.\n\n[260:3](vp075.htm#fr_745) The Vayu gives the names of the individuals of these\ntwo classes, consisting each of twelve. It furnishes also the nomenclature of\nall the classes of divinities, and of the sons of the Manus in each\nManwantara. According to the same authority, the Tushitas were the sons of\nKratu: the Bhagavata calls them the sons of Tushita by Veda\xc5\x9biras. The\ndivinities of each period are, according to the Vayu, those to whom offerings\nof the Soma juice and the like are presented collectively.\n\n[260:4](vp075.htm#fr_746) The Vayu describes the Rishis of each Manwantara as\nthe sons, or in some cases the descendants in a direct line, of the seven\nsages, Atri, Angiras, Bhrigu, Ka\xc5\x9byapa, Pulaha, Pulastya, and Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha; with\nsome inconsistency, for Ka\xc5\x9byapa, at least, did not appear himself until the\nseventh, Manwantara. In the present series \xc3\x9arja is the son of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha,\nStambha springs from Ka\xc5\x9byapa, Pran\xcc\x81a from Bhrigu, Dattoli is the son of\nPulastya, Rishabha descends from Angiras, Ni\xc5\x9bchara from Atri, and Arvarivat is\nthe son of Pulaha. The Brahma P. and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba have a rather different list,\nor Aurva, Stambha, Ka\xc5\x9byapa, Pran\xcc\x81a, Vrihaspati, Chyavana, and Dattoli; but the\norigin of part of this difference is nothing more than an imperfect quotation\nfrom the Vayu Puran\xcc\x81a; the two first, Aurva and Stambha, being specified as\nthe son of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha and the descendant of Ka\xc5\x9byapa, and then the parentage of\nthe rest being omitted: to complete the seven, therefore, Ka\xc5\x9byapa becomes one\nof them. Some other errors of this nature occur in these two works, and from\nthe same cause, a blundering citation of the Vayu, which is named as their\nauthority. A curious peculiarity also occurs in these mistakes. They are\nconfined to the first eight Manwantaras. The Brahma P. omits all details of\nthe last six, and the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba inserts them fully and correctly, agreeably\nto the authority of the Vayu. It looks, therefore, as if the compiler of the\nHari Van\xc5\x9ba had followed the Brahma, as far as it went, right or wrong; but had\nhad recourse to the original Vayu P. when the Brahma failed him. Dattoli is\nsometimes written Dattoni and Dattotri; and the latter appears to have been\nthe case with the copy of the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba employed by M. Langlois, who makes\none of the Rishis of this Manwantara, "le penitent Atri." He is not without\ncountenance in some such reading, for the Padma P. changes the name to\nDattatreya, no doubt suggested by Datta-atri. p. 261 Dattatreya, however, is\nthe son of Atri; whilst the Vayu calls the person of the text the son of\nPulastya. There can be no doubt therefore of the correct reading, for the son\nof Pulastya is Dattoli. ([p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83).)\n\n[261:5](vp075.htm#fr_747) The Vayu agrees with the text in these names, adding\nseven others. The Bhagavata has a different series. The Padma has four other\nnames, Nabha, Nabhasya, Prasriti, Bhavana. The Brahma has ten names, including\ntwo of these, and several of the names of the Rishis of the tenth Manwantara.\nThe Matsya has the four names of the Padma for the sons of the Manu, and gives\nseven others, Havindhra, Sukrita, Murtti, Apas, Jyotir, Aya, Smrita (the names\nof the Brahma), as the seven Prajapatis of this period, and sons of\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. The sons of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, however, belong to the third Manwantara,\nand bear different appellations. There is, no doubt, some blundering here in\nall the books except the Vayu, and those which agree with it.\n\n[261:6](vp075.htm#fr_748) The name occurs Auttami, Auttama, and Uttama. The\nBhagavata and Vayu agree with our text (p. 263) in making him a descendant\nfrom Priyavrata. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya calls him the son of Uttama, the son of\nUttanapada: and this appears to be the correct genealogy, both from our text\nand the Bhagavata.\n\n[261:7](vp075.htm#fr_749) The Brahma and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba have, in place of these,\nthe Bhanus; but the Vayu and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya concur with the text.\n\n[261:8](vp075.htm#fr_750) All the authorities agree in this; but the Brahma\nand Hari Van\xc5\x9ba appear to furnish a different series also; or even a third,\naccording to the French translation: \'Dans le troisieme Manwantara parurent\ncomme Saptarchis les fils de Vasichtha, de son nom appeles Vasichthas, les\nfils de Hiranyagarbha et les illustres enfans d\'Ourdja.\' The text is, ### &c.\nThe meaning of which is, \'There were (in the first Manwantara) seven\ncelebrated sons of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, who (in the third Manwantara) were sons of\nBrahma (i. e. Rishis), the illustrious posterity of Urjja. We have already\nseen that Urjja was the wife of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, by whom she had seven sons,\nRajas,\' &c. (see [p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83)), in the Swayambhuva Manwantara;\nand these were born again as the Rishis of the third period. The names of\nthese persons, according to the Matsya and Padma, are however very different\nfrom those of the sons of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, given [p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83), or\nKaukundihi, Kurundi, Dalaya, \xc5\x9aankha, Pravahita, Mita, and Sammita.\n\n[261:9](vp075.htm#fr_751) The Vayu adds ten other names to those of the text.\nThe Brahma gives ten p. 262 altogether different. The Bhagavata an Padma have\neach a separate nomenclature.\n\n[262:10](vp075.htm#fr_752) Of these, the Brahma and Hari V notice only the\nSatyas: the Matsya and Padma have only Sadhyas. The Vayu Bhagavata, Kurma, and\nMarkan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya agree with the text.\n\n[262:11](vp075.htm#fr_753) He is the son of Priyavrata, according to the text,\nthe Vayu, &c. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya has a legend of his birth by a doe; and from\nhis being begotten in dark, tempestuous weather, he derives his name.\n\n[262:12](vp075.htm#fr_754) Severally, according to the Vayu, the progeny of\nBhrigu, Ka\xc5\x9byapa, Angiras, Pulastya, Atri, Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, and Pulaha. There is\nconsiderable variety in some of the names. Thus the Matsya has Kavi, Prithu,\nAgni, Salpa, Dhimat, Kapi, Akapi. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba has Kavya, Prithu, Agni,\nJahnu, Dhatri, Kapivat, Akapivat. For the two last the Vayu reads Gatra and\nVanapitha. The son of Pulaha is in his place ([p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83). n.\n[6](vp045.htm#fn_245)), Arvarivat or Vanakapivat. Gatra is amongst the sons of\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha ([p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83)). The Vayu is therefore probably most\ncorrect, although our text, in regard to these two denominations, admits of no\ndoubt.\n\n[262:13](vp075.htm#fr_755) The Vayu, &c. agree with the text; the Vayu naming\neleven. The Brahma, Matsya, and Padma have a series of ten names, Sutapas,\nTapomula, &c.; of which, seven are the Rishis of the twelfth Manwantara.\n\n[262:14](vp075.htm#fr_756) Raivata, as well as his three predecessors, is\nregarded usually as a descendant of Priyavrata. The Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya has a long\nlegend of his birth, as the son of king Durgama by the nymph Revati, sprung\nfrom the constellation Revati, whom Ritavach, a Muni, caused to fall from\nheaven. Her radiance became a lake on mount Kumuda, thence called Raivataka;\nand from it appeared the damsel, who was brought up by Pramucha Muni. Upon the\nmarriage of Revati, the Muni, at her request, restored the asterism to its\nplace in the skies.\n\n[262:15](vp075.htm#fr_757) The Brahma inserts of these only the Abhutarajasas,\nwith the remark, that \'they were of like nature (with their name):\' i. e. they\nwere exempt from the quality of passion. M. Langlois, in rendering the\nparallel passage of the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, has confounded the epithet and the\nsubject: \'dont les dieux furent les Pracritis, depourvu de p. 263 colere et de\npassion.\' He is also at a loss what to do with the terms Pariplava and\nRaibhya, in the following passage; ### asking, \'qu\'est ce que Pariplava?\nqu\'est ce que Rebhya?\' If he had had the commentary at hand, these questions\nwould have been unnecessary: they are there said to be two classes of\ndivinities.\n\n[263:16](vp075.htm#fr_758) There is less variety in these names than usual.\nVedabahu is read Devabahu; Sudhaman, Satyanetra; and Mahamuni, Muni, Yajur,\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, and Yadudhra. According to the Vayu, those of the text are\nrespectively of the lineage of Angiras, Bhrigu, Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, Pulastya, Atri,\nPulaha, and Ka\xc5\x9byapa. There is considerable variety in the names of the Manu\'s\nsons.\n\n[263:17](vp075.htm#fr_759) Chakshusha, according to the best authorities,\ndescended from Dhruva (see p. 98); but the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya has a legend of his\nbirth as the son of a Kshatriya, named Anamitra; of his being exchanged at his\nbirth for the son of Vi\xc5\x9branta Raja, and being brought up by the prince as his\nown; of his revealing the business when a man, and propitiating Brahma by his\ndevotions; in consequence of which he became a Manu. In his former birth he\nwas born from the eye of Brahma; whence his name, from Chakshush, \'the eye.\'\n\n[263:18](vp075.htm#fr_760) The authorities agree as to the number, but differ\nas to the names; reading for \xc3\x81dyas, \xc3\x81ryas and \xc3\x81pyas; for Prastutas, Prabhutas\nand Prasutas; for Prithugas, Prithukas and Prithusas; and, which is a more\nwide deviation, Ribhus for Bhavyas. M. Langlois omits the Prasutas, and\ninserts Divaukasas; but the latter, meaning \'divinities,\' is only an epithet.\nThe Hari Van\xc5\x9ba has, ###---. The comment adds, ###.\n\n[263:19](vp075.htm#fr_761) The Vayu reads Sudhaman for the first name; Unnata\nfor Uttama; and Abhimana for Abhinaman. The latter occurs also Abhinamin\n(Matsya) and Atinaman (Hari V.) The latter reads, no doubt incorrectly,\nBhrigu, Nabha, and p. 264 Vivaswat for Uttama, Madhu, and Havishmat. The sons\nof Chakshusha are enumerated, [p. 98](vp048.htm#page_98).\n\n[264:20](vp075.htm#fr_762) There is no great variety of nomenclature in this\nManwantara. The Vayu adds to the deities the Sadhyas, Vi\xc5\x9bwas, Maruts, and gods\nsprung from Bhrigu and Angiras. The Bhagavata adds the Ribhus: and most\ninclude the two \xc3\x81swins as a class. Of the Maruts, however, the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba\nremarks that they are born in every Manwantara, seven times seven (or forty-\nnine); that in each Manwantara four times seven, or twenty-eight, obtain\nemancipation, but their places are filled up by persons reborn in that\ncharacter. So the commentator explains the passages ### and ### &c. ###\nComment. ### Comment. It may be suspected, however, that these passages have\nbeen derived from the simple statement of the Matsya, that in all the\nManwantaras classes of Rishis appear by seven and seven, and having\nestablished a code of law and morality, depart to felicity. The Vayu has a\nrather different list of the seven Rishis; or Vasumat, the son of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha;\nVatsara, descended from Ka\xc5\x9byapa; Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra, the son of Gadhi, and of the\nKu\xc5\x9bika race; Jamadagni, son of Kuru, of the race of Bhrigu; Bharadwaja, son of\nVrihaspati; \xc5\x9aaradwat, son of Gautama, of the family of Utatthya; and\nBrahmakosha or Atri, descended from Brahma. All the other authorities agree\nwith our text.\n\n[264:21](vp075.htm#fr_763) The nominal father being the patriarch Ruchi. (See\n[p. 54](vp041.htm#page_54).)\n\n[265:22](vp075.htm#fr_764) There is no further account of this incarnation in\nthe Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a. Fuller details occur in the Bhagavata, Kurma, Matsya, and\nVamana Puran\xcc\x81as. The first of these (b. VIII. c. 15-23) relates the penance\nand sacrifices of Bali, son of Virochana, by which he had overcome Indra and\nthe gods, and obtained supreme dominion over the three spheres. Vishn\xcc\x81u, at\nthe request of the deities, was born as a dwarf, Vamana, the son of Aditi by\nKa\xc5\x9byapa; who, applying to Bali for alms, was promised by the prince whatever\nhe might demand, notwithstanding \xc5\x9aukra, the preceptor of the Daityas, apprised\nhim whom he had to deal with. The dwarf demanded as much space as he could\nstep over at three steps; and upon the assent of Bali, enlarged himself to\nsuch dimensions as to stride over the three worlds. Being worshipped however\nby Bali and his ancestor Prahlada, he conceded to them the sovereignty of\nPatala.\n\n[265:23](vp075.htm#fr_765) See the same etymology, [p. 3](vp035.htm#page_3).\nn.
