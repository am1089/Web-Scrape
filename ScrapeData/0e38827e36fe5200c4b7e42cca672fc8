Now, the A _m_ _s_ u (graha), forsooth, is no other than Pra _g_\napati: that (cup) is his (Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\'s or the\n\np. 424\n\n[paragraph continues] Sacrificer\'s) self 1, for Pra _g_ apati is the self.\nHence when they draw that (cup) they produce that self of his. Therein they\nlay these vital airs, according to as these vital airs, the grahas, are\nexplained 2; and verily the sacrificer is born with his whole body in yonder\nworld.\n\n4:6:1:22\\. Where they draw that (cup), then that is (like) having a hold 3;\nand where they do not draw it, then that is (like) having no hold: therefore,\nthen, he draws the A _m_ _s_ u.\n\n4:6:1:33\\. He draws it with a vessel of u _d_ umbara wood; for that (cup) is\nPra _g_ apati, and the u _d_ umbara tree is Pra _g_ apati\'s own: therefore he\ndraws it with a vessel of u _d_ umbara wood.\n\n4:6:1:44\\. He draws it with a square vessel; for there are here three worlds:\nthese three worlds he obtains by three (corners). And Pra _g_ apati is the\nfourth over and above these three worlds: thus he obtains Pra _g_ apati by the\nfourth (corner): therefore he draws it with a square vessel.\n\n4:6:1:55\\. Silently he takes up the pressing-stone; silently he throws down\nthe Soma-plants (a _m_ _s_ u); silently he pours water thereon; silently\nraising (the stone), he\n\np. 425\n\npresses once; silently he offers that (libation) without drawing breath: thus\nhe makes him (the sacrificer) to be Pra _g_ apati.\n\n4:6:1:66\\. Now there is a piece of gold in that (spoon): that he smells at.\nAnd if he either galls or scratches himself at this (sacrifice),--gold being\nimmortal life,--he lays that immortal life into his own self.\n\n4:6:1:77\\. As to this Rama Aupatasvini said, \'Let him freely breathe out and\nfreely breathe in: if he but offers silently, thereby he makes him (the\nsacrificer) to be Pra _g_ apati.\'\n\n4:6:1:88\\. Now there is a piece of gold in that (spoon): that he smells at.\nAnd if he either galls or scratches himself at this (sacrifice),--gold being\nimmortal life, he lays that immortal life into his own self.\n\n4:6:1:99\\. As to this Budila \xc3\x82 _s_ vatara _s_ vi said, \'Let him draw it after\nmerely raising (the stone), and let him not press; for they do press for other\ndeities: thus he does different from what he does for other deities; and in\nthat he raises (the stone) thereby indeed the pressing takes place for him.\'\n\n4:6:1:1010\\. As to this Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said, \'Nay, let him press: "The\nunpressed Soma delighted not the mighty Indra, nor the outpressed draughts\nwithout prayer," thus spake the _Ri_ shi (Rig-veda VII, 26, I). For no other\ndeity does he strike but once: thus he does different from what he does for\nother deities,--therefore let him press!\'\n\n4:6:1:1111\\. Twelve heifers pregnant with their first calf are the priests\'\nfee for this (graha). Now there are twelve months in the year, and Pra _g_\napati is the year, and the A _m_ _s_ u is Pra _g_ apati: thus he makes him\n(the sacrificer) to be Pra _g_ apati.\n\n4:6:1:1212\\. They have twelve embryo calves,--that makes\n\np. 426\n\ntwenty-four. Now there are twenty-four half-moons in the year, and Pra _g_\napati is the year, and the A _m_ _s_ u is Pra _g_ apati: thus he makes him to\nbe Pra _g_ apati.\n\n4:6:1:1313\\. Now Kaukusta 1 indeed gave as many as twenty-four heifers with\ntheir first calf as dakshi _n_ as, and a bull as the twenty-fifth, and gold;\nand truly that is what he gave.\n\n4:6:1:1414\\. This (graha) should not be drawn for every one, since this is his\n(Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\'s) self. It should only be drawn for one who is well known, or\none who is his (the Adhvaryu\'s) friend, or one who, being learned in sacred\nlore, would acquire it by his study.\n\n4:6:1:1515\\. It should be drawn at a (sacrifice with) a thousand (cows as the\npriests\' fee); for a thousand is everything, and this (graha) is everything.\nIt should be drawn at (a sacrifice) where the entire property is given away,\nfor the entire property is everything, and this (graha) is everything. It\nshould be drawn at a Vi _s_ va _g_ it with all the P _ri_ sh _th_ as, for the\nVi _s_ va _g_ it (\'all-conquering\') is everything, and this (cup) is\neverything. It should be drawn at a Va _g_ apeya and Ra _g_ asuya, for that is\neverything. It should be drawn at a sattra (sacrificial session), for the\nsattra means everything 2, and this (cup) means everything. These are the\ndrawings.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[424:1](sbe2670.htm#fr_989) Or body (atman); a _m_ _s_ u meaning the Soma-\nplant, and hence the body of the Soma. This graha seems to consist of\nimperfectly pressed Soma-plants in water. Cf. Katy. XII, 5, 6-12. See also _S_\nat. Br. IV, I, I, 2; Taitt. S. VI, 6, 10; Say. on Taitt. S. I, p. 603. In the\nKa _n_ va text this Brahma _n_ a is followed by one on the Adabhya graha,\nwhich is identified with speech.\n\n[424:2](sbe2670.htm#fr_990) Or, perhaps, according to as the grahas are\nexplained as being these vital airs.\n\n[424:3](sbe2670.htm#fr_991) Or, like something that has a handle. The Ka _n_\nva text reads,--for whomsoever they draw that (cup), his vital airs are, as it\nwere, supplied\' with a firmer hold, and, as it were, firmly established\n(arambha _n_ avattara iva pratish _th_ ita iva). And for whomsoever they do\nnot draw it, his vital airs are, as it were, without any hold (\'haltloser\')\nand quite unrestrained (anarambha _n_ atara ivasyayatatara iva pra _n_ a _h_\n).\n\n[426:1](sbe2670.htm#fr_992) The Ka _n_ va MISS. read \'Kaukthasta.\'\n\n[426:2](sbe2670.htm#fr_993) Perhaps the author here means to connect sattra\n(satra) with the adverbs satram, satra, \'altogether, always,\' instead of with\nthe verb sad, to sit; but cf. [IV, 6, 8, 1](sbe2677.htm#4:6:8:1).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 6, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe2671.htm)\n\n'
