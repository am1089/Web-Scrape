There is exchange (of meditation), for the texts distinguish (two\nmeditations); as in other cases.\n\nThe Aitareyins declare with reference to the person in the sun, 'What I am,\nthat is he; what he is, that am I' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 2, 4, 6). And the _G_ abalas\nsay, 'I am thou indeed, O reverend divinity, and thou art I indeed.'--The\ndoubt here arises whether the reflection founded upon this text is to be a\ndouble one 'by means of exchange' (i.e. whether the soul is to be meditated\nupon as aditya and aditya as the soul), or a simple one (the soul only being\nmeditated upon as aditya).\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains the latter view; for, he says, the text cannot\npossibly propose as matter of meditation anything but the oneness of the\nindividual soul with the Lord. For if we assumed that two different forms of\nmeditation are intended, viz. firstly the soul's being the Self of the Lord,\nand, secondly, the Lord's being the Self of the soul, the soul indeed would be\nexalted by the former meditation, but the Lord, at the same time, be lowered\nby the latter one. We therefore conclude that the meditation is to be of one\nkind only, and that the double form, in which the text exhibits it, merely\naims at confirming the oneness of the Self.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. 'Exchange' is expressly recorded in the\ntext for the purposes of meditation, just as other qualities (of the Self),\nsuch as its being the Self of all, &c., are recorded for the same purpose. For\nboth texts make the distinctive double enunciation, 'I am thou,' and 'Thou art\nI.' Now this double enunciation has a sense only if a twofold meditation is to\nbe based upon it; otherwise it would be devoid of meaning, since one statement\nwould be all that is required.--But has not the purvapakshin urged above that\nthis your explanation involves a lowering of the Lord, who is thereby\nrepresented as having the transmigrating soul for his Self?--Never mind, we\nreply; even in that way only the unity of the Self is meditated upon.--But\ndoes your explanation\n\np. 245\n\nthen not come to that of the purvapakshin, viz. that the double statement is\nmerely meant to confirm the oneness of the Self?--We do not, our reply is,\ndeny that the text confirms the oneness of the Self; we only want to prove\nthat, on the ground of the text as it stands, a twofold meditation has to be\nadmitted, not a simple one. That this virtually confirms the unity of the Self\nwe admit; just as the instruction about (the Lord's) possessing such qualities\nas having only true wishes, and so on--which instruction is given for the\npurpose of meditation--at the same time proves the existence of a Lord endowed\nwith such qualities.--Hence the double relation enounced in the text has to be\nmeditated upon, and is to be transferred to other vidyas also which treat of\nthe same subject.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 38](sbe38181.htm)\n\n"
