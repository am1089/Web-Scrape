 \nNow is the time when all day long  \nThe Koils fill the woods with song.  \nAnd gardens bloom at spring\'s sweet touch  \nWhich my beloved loved so much.  \nAh me, Sumitra\'s son, the fire  \nOf sorrow, sprung from soft desire.  \nFanned by the charms the spring time shows,  \nWill burn my heart and end my woes,  \nWhose sad eyes look on each fair tree,  \nBut my sweet love no more may see.  \nAh me, Ah me, from hour to hour  \nLove in my soul will wax in power,  \nAnd spring, upon whose charms I gaze,  \nWhose breath the heat of toil allays,  \nWith thoughts of her for whom I strain  \nMy hopeless eyes, increase my pain.  \nAs fire in summer rages through  \nThe forests thick with dry bamboo,  \nSo will my fawn eyed love consume  \nMy soul o\'erwhelmed with thoughts of gloom.  \nBehold, beneath each spreading tree  \nThe peacoks dance  1b in frantic glee,  \nAnd, stirred by all the gales that blow,  \nTheir tails with jewelled windows glow,  \nEach bird, in happy love elate,  \nRejoices with his darling mate.  \nBut sights like these of joy and peace  \nMy pangs of hopeless love increase.  \nSee on the mountain slope above  \nThe peahen languishing with love.  \nBehold her now in amorous dance  \nClose to her consort\'s side advance.  \nHe with a laugh of joy and pride  \nDisplays his glittering pinions wide;  \nAnd follows through the tangled dell  \nThe partner whom he loves so well.  \nAh happy bird! no giant\'s hate  \nHas robbed him of his tender mate;  \nAnd still beside his loved one he  \nDances beneath the shade in glee.  \nAh, in this month when flowers are fair  \nMy widowed woe is hard to bear.  \nSee, gentle love a home may find  \nIn creatures of inferior kind.  \nSee how the peahen turns to meet  \nHer consort now with love-drawn feet.  \n\np. 321  \n\nSo, Lakshman, if my large-eyed dear,  \nThe child of Janak still were here,  \nShe, by love\'s thrilling influence, led,  \nUpon my breast would lay her head.  \nThese blooms I gathered from the bough  \nWithout my love are useless now,  \nA thousand blossoms fair to see  \nWith passing glory clothe each tree  \nThat hangs its cluster-burthened head  \nNow that the dewy months  1 are fled,  \nBut, followed by the bees that ply  \nTheir fragrant task, they fall and die.  \nA thousand birds in wild delight  \nTheir rapture-breathing notes unite;  \nBird calls to bird in joyous strain,  \nAnd turns my love to frenzied pain,  \nO, if beneath those alien skies,  \nThere be a spring where Sita lies,  \nI know my prisoned love must be  \nTouched with like grief, and mourn with me.  \nBut ah, methinks that dreary clime.  \nKnows not the touch of spring\'s sweet time.  \nHow could my black eyed love sustain,  \nWithout her lord, so dire a pain?  \nOr if the sweet spring come to her  \nIn distant lands a prisoner,  \nHow may his advent and her met  \nOn every side with taunt and threat?  \nAh, if the springtide\'s languor came  \nWith sort enchantment o\'er my dame,  \nMy darling of the lotus eye,  \nMy gently speaking love, would die;  \nFor well my spirit knows that she  \nCan never live bereft of me  \nWith love that never wavered yet  \nMy Sita\'s heart, on me is set,  \nWho, with a soul that ne\'er can stray,  \nWith equal love her love repay.  \nIn vain, in vain the soft wind brings  \nSweet blossoms on his balmy wings;  \nDelicious from his native snow,  \nTo me like fire he seems to glow,  \nO, how I loved a breeze like this  \nWhen darling Sita shared the bliss!  \nBut now in vain for me it blows  \nTo fan the fury of my woes.  \nThat dark-winged bird that sought the skies  \nForetelling grief with warning cries,  \nSits on the tree where buds are gay,  \nAnd pours glad music from the spray.  \nThat rover of the fiels of air  \nWill aid my love with friendly care,  \nAnd me with gracious pity guide  \n\nTo my large-eved Videhan\'s side.  1b  \nHark, Lakshman, how the woods around  \nWith love-inspiring chants resound,  \nWhere birds in every bloom-crowned tree  \nPour forth their amorous minstrelsy.  \nAs though an eager gallant wooed  \nA gentle maid by love subdued,  \nEnamoured of her flowers the bee  \nDarts at the wind-rocked Tila tree.  2b  \nAs\'oka, brightest tree that grows,  \nThat lends a pang to lovers\' woes,  \nHangs out his gorgeous bloom in scorn  \nAnd mocks me as I weep forlorn.  \nO Lakshman, turn thine eye and see  \nEach blossom-laden Mango tree,  \nLike a young lover gaily dressed  \nWhom fond desire forbids to rest  \nLook, son of Queen Sumitra through  \nThe forest glades of varied hue,  \nWhere blooms are bright and grass is green  \nThe Kinnars  3b with their loves are seen.  \nSee, brother, see where sweet and bright  \nThose crimson lotus charm the sight,  \nAnd o\'er the flood a radiance throw  \nFair as the morning\'s roseate glow.  \nSee, Pampa, most divinely sweet,  \nThe swan\'s and mallard\'s loved retreat,  \nShows her glad waters bright and clear,  \nWhere lotuses their heads uprear  \nFrom the pure wave, and charm the view  \nWith mingled tints of red and blue.  \nEach like the morning\'s early beams  \nReflected in the crystal gleams;  \nAnd bees in their sweet toil intent  \nWeigh down each tender filament  \nThere with gay lawns the wood recedes;  \nThere wildfowl sport amid the reeds,  \nThere roedeer stand upon the brink,  \nAnd elephants descend to dunk.  \nThe rippling waves which winds make fleet  \nAgainst the bending lilies beat,  \nAnd opening bud and flower and stem  \nGleam with the drops that hang on them.  \nLife has no pleasure left for me  \nWhile my dear queen I may not see,  \n\np. 322  \n\nWho loved so well those blooms that vie  \nWith the full splendour of her eye,  \nO tyrant Love, who will not let  \nMy bosom for one hour forget  \nThe lost one whom I yearn to meet,  \nWhose words were ever kind and sweet.  \nAh, haply might my heart endure  \nThis hopeless love that knows not cure,  \nIf spring with all his trees in flower  \nAssailed me not with ruthless power.  \nEach lovely scene, each sound and sight  \nWherein, with her. I found delight,  \nHas lost the charm so sweet of yore,  \nAnd glads my widowed heart no more.  \nOn lotus buds I seem to gaze,  \nOr blooms that deck Palas\'a  1 sprays;  \nBut to my tortured memory rise  \nThe glories of my darling\'s eyes.  \nCool breezes through the forest stray  \nGathering odours on their way,  \nEnriched with all the rifled scent  \nOf lotus flower and filament.  \nTheir touch upon my temples falls  \nAnd Sita\'s fragrant breath recalls.  \nNow look, dear brother, on the right  \nOf Pampa towers a mountain height  \nWhere fairest Cassia trees unfold  \nThe treasures of their burnished gold.  \nProud mountain king this woody side  \nWith myriad ores is decked and dyed,  \nAnd as the wind-swept blossoms fall  \nTheir fragrant dust is stained with all.  \nTo yon high lands thy glances turn:  \nWith pendent fire they flash and burn,  \nWhere in their vernal glory blaze  \nPalasa flowers on leafless sprays.  \nO Lakshinan, look! on Pampa\'s side  \nWhat fair trees rise in blooming pride!  \nWhat climbing plants above them show  \n\nOr hang their flowery garlands low  \nSee how the amorous creeper rings  \nThe wind-rocked trees to which she clings,  \nAs though a dame by love impelled  \nWith clasping arms her lover held.  \nDrunk with the varied scents that fill  \nThe balmy air. from hill to hill,  \nFrom grove to grove, from tree to tree,  \nThe joyous wind is wandering free.  \nThese gay trees wave their branches bent  \nBy blooms, of honey redolent.  \nThere, slowly opening to the day,  \nBuds with dark lustre deck the spray.  \nThe wild bee rests a moment where  \nEach tempting flower is sweet and fair,  \nThen, coloured by the pollen dyes,  \nDeep in some odorous blossom lies.  \nSoon from his couch away he springs:  \nTo other trees his course he wings,  \nAnd tastes the honeyed blooms that grow  \nWhere Pampa\'s lucid waters flow.  \nSee, Lakshman, see, how thickly spread  \nWith blossoms from the trees o\'erhead,  \nThat grass the weary traveller woos  \nWith couches of a thousand hues,  \nAnd beds on every height arrayed  \nWith red and yellow tints are laid,  \nNo longer winter chills the earth:  \nA thousand flowerets spring to birth,  \nAnd trees in rivalry assume  \nTheir vernal garb of bud and bloom.  \nHow fair they look, how bright and gay  \nWith tasselled flowers on every spray!  \nWhile each to each proud challenge flings  \nBorne in the song the wild bee sings.  \nThat mallard by the river edge  \nHas bathed amid the reeds and sedge:  \nNow with his mate he fondly plays  \nAnd fires my bosom as I gaze.  \n   Mandakini  1b is far renowned:  \nNo lovelier flood on earth is found;  \nBut all her fairest charms combined  \nIn this sweet stream enchant the mind,  \n0, if my love were here to look  \nWith me upon this lovely brook,  \nNe\'er for Ayodhya would I pine,  \nOr wish that Indra\'s lot were mine.  \nIf by my darling\'s side I strayed  \nO\'er the soft turf which decks the glade,  \nEach craving thought were sweetly stilled,  \nEach longing of my soul fulfilled.  \nBut, now my love is far away,  \nThose trees which make the woods so gay,  \nIn all their varied beauty dressed,  \nWake thoughts of anguish in my breast.  \n   That lotus-covered stream behold  \nWhose waters run so fresh and cold,  \n\np. 323  \n\nSweet rill, the wildfowl\'s loved resort,  \nWhere curlew, swan, and diver sport;  \nWhere with his consort plays the drake,  \nAnd tall deer love their thirst to slake,  \nWhile from each woody bank is heard  \nThe wild note of each happy bird.  \nThe music of that joyous quire  \nFills all my soul with soft desire;  \nAnd, as I hear, my sad thoughts fly  \nTo Sita of the lotus eye,  \nWhom, lovely with her moonbright cheek,  \nIn vain mine eager glances seek.  \nNow turn, those chequered lawns survey  \nWhere hart and hind together stray.  \nAh, as they wander at their will  \nMy troubled breast with grief they fill,  \nWhile torn by hopeless love I sigh  \nFor Sita of the fawn-like eye.  \nIf in those glades where, touched by spring,  \nGay birds their amorous ditties sing,  \nMine own beloved I might see,  \nThen, brother, it were well with me:  \nIf by my side she wandered still,  \nAnd this cool breeze that stirs the rill  \nTouched with its gentle breath the brows  \nOf mine own dear Videhan spouse.  \nFor, Lakshman, O how blest are those  \nOn whom the breath of Pampa blows,  \nDispelling all their care and gloom  \nWith sweets from where the lilies bloom!  \nHow can my gentle love remain  \nAlive amid the woe and pain,  \nWhere prisoned far away she lies,--  \nMy darling of the lotus eyes?  \nHow shall I dare her sire to greet  \nWhose lips have never known deceit?  \nHow stand before the childless king  \nAnd meet his eager questioning?  \nWhen banished by my sire\'s decree,  \nIn low estate, she followed me.  \nSo pure, so true to every vow,  \nWhere is my gentle darling now?  \nHow can I bear my widowed lot,  \nAnd linger on where she is not,  \nWho followed when from home I fled  \nDistracted, disinherited?  \nMy spirit sinks in hopeless pain  \nWhen my fond glances yearn in vain  \nFor that dear face with whose bright eye  \nThe worshipped lotus scarce can vie.  \nAh when, my brother, shall I hear  \nThat voice that rang so soft and clear,  \nWhen, sweetly smiling as she spoke,  \nFrom her dear lips gay laughter broke?  \nWhen worn with toil and love I strayed  \nWith Sita through the forest shade,  \nNo trace of grief was seen in her,  \nMy kind and thoughtful comforter.  \nHow shall my faltering tongue relate  \nTo Queen Kaus\'alya Sita\'s fate?  \nHow answer when in wild despair  \n\nShe questions, Where is Sita, where?  \nHaste, brother, haste: to Bharat hie,  \nOn whose fond love I still rely.  \nMy life can be no longer borne,  \nSince Sita from my side is torn.\'  \n   Thus like a helpless mourner, bent  \nBy sorrow, Rama made lament;  \nAnd with wise counsel Lakshman tried  \nTo soothe his care, and thus replied:  \n   \'O best of men, thy grief oppose,  \nNor sink beneath thy weight of woes.  \nNot thus despond the great and pure  \nAnd brave like thee, but still endure.  \nReflect what anguish wrings the heart  \nWhen loving souls are forced to part;  \nAnd, mindful of the coming pain,  \nThy love within thy breast restrain,  \nFor earth, though cooled by wandering streams,  \nLies scorched beneath the midday beams,  \nRavan his steps to hell may bend,  \nOr lower yet in flight descend;  \nBut be tbou sure, O Raghu\'s son,  \nAvenging death he shall not shun.  \nRise, Rama, rise: the search begin,  \nAnd track the giant foul with sin.  \nThen shall the fiend, though far he fly,  \nResign his prey or surely die.  \nYea, though the trembling monster hide  \nWith Sita close to Diti\'s  1 side,  \nE\'en there, unless he yield the prize,  \nSlain by this wrathful hand he dies.  \nThy heart with strength and courage stay,  \nAnd cast this weakling mood away.  \nOur fainting hopes in vain revive  \nUnless with firm resolve we strive.  \nThe zeal that fires the toiler\'s breast  \nMid earthly powers is first and best.  \nZeal every check and bar defies,  \nAnd wins at length the loftiest prize,  \nIn woe and danger, toil and care,  \nZeal never yields to weak despair.  \nWith zealous heart thy task begin,  \nAnd thou once more thy spouse shalt win.  \nCast fruitless sorrow from thy soul,  \nNor let this love thy heart control.  \nForget not all thy sacred lore,  \nBut be thy noble self once more.\'  \n    He heard, his bosom rent by grief,  \nThe counsel of his brother chief;  \nCrushed in his heart the maddening pain,  \nAnd rose resolved and strong again.  \nThen forth upon his journey went  \nThe hero on his task intent,  \nNor thought of Pampa\'s lovely brook,  \n\np. 324  \n\nOr trees which murmuring breezes shook,  \nThough on dark woods his glances fell,  \nOn waterfall and cave and dell;  \nAnd still by many a care distressed  \nThe son of Raghu onward pressed.  \nAs some wild elephant elate  \n     Moves through the woods in pride,  \nSo Lakshman with majestic gait  \n     Strode by his brother\'s side.  \nHe, for his lofty spirit famed,  \n     Admonished and condoled;  \nShowed Raghu\'s son what duty claimed,  \n     And bade his heart be bold.  \nThen as the brothers strode apace  \n     To Rishyamuka\'s height,  \nThe sovereign of the Vanar race [1](ry277.htm#fn_537)  \n     Was troubled at the sight.  \nAs on the lofty hill he strayed  \n     He saw the chiefs draw near:  \nA while their glorious forms surveyed,  \n     And mused in restless fear.  \nHis slow majestic step he stayed  \n     And gazed upon the pair.  \nAnd all his spirit sank dismayed  \n     By fear too great to bear.  \nWhen in their glorious might the best  \n     Of royal chiefs came nigh,  \nThe Vanars in their wild unrest  \n     Prepared to turn and fly.  \nThey sought the hermit\'s sacred home  [2](ry277.htm#fn_538)  \n     For peace and bliss ordained,  \nAnd there, where Vanars loved to roam.  \n     A sure asylum gained.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[319:1](ry275.htm#fr_523) Or Kishkindha Kanda.
