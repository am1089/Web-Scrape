And on account of distinctive qualities.\n\nEverywhere in that section we meet with statements of distinctive attributes\nof the two Selfs, the highest Self\n\np. 269\n\nbeing represented as the object of meditation and attainment, and the\nindividual Self as the meditating and attaining subject. The passage 'When he\nhas known and understood that which is born from Brahman, the intelligent, to\nbe divine and venerable, then he obtains everlasting peace' (I, 1, 17) refers\nto the meditating individual soul which recognises itself as being of the\nnature of Brahman. On the other hand, I, 3, 2, 'That which is a bridge for\nsacrificers. the highest imperishable Brahman for those who wish to cross over\nto the fearless shore, the Na _k_ iketa, may we be able to know that,' refers\nto the highest Self as the object of meditation; 'Na _k_ iketa' here meaning\nthat which is to be reached through the Na _k_ iketa-rite. Again, the passage\n'Know the Self to be sitting in the chariot and the body to be the chariot'\n(I, 3, 3) refers to the meditating individual soul; and the verse, I, 3, 9,\n'But he who has understanding for his charioteer, and holds the reins of the\nmind, he reaches the end of his journey, and that is the highest place of Vish\n_n_ u.' refers to the embodied and the highest Selfs as that which attains and\nthat which is to be attained. And in the text under discussion also (I, 3, 1),\nthe two Selfs are distinctly designated as light and shade, the one being all-\nknowing, the other devoid of knowledge.\n\nBut, a new objection is raised, the initial passage, I, 1, 20, 'That doubt\nwhich there is when a man is dead--some saying, he is; others, he is not,'\nclearly asks a question as to the true nature of the individual soul, and we\nhence conclude that that soul forms the topic of the whole chapter.--Not so,\nwe reply. That question does not spring from any doubt as to the existence or\nnon-existence of the soul apart from the body; for if this were so the two\nfirst boons chosen by Na _k_ iketas would be unsuitable. For the story runs as\nfollows: When the sacrifice offered by the father of Na _k_ iketas--at which\nall the possessions of the sacrificcr were to be given to the priests--is\ndrawing towards its close, the boy, feeling afraid that some deficiency on the\npart of the gifts might render the sacrifice unavailing, and dutifully wishing\nto render his father's sacrifice complete by giving his own person also,\nrepeatedly asks\n\np. 270\n\nhis father, 'And to whom will you give me'? The father, irritated by the boy's\npersistent questioning, gives an angry reply, and in consequence of this the\nboy goes to the palace of Yama, and Yama being absent, stays there for three\ndays without eating. Yama on his return is alarmed at this neglect of\nhospitality, and wishing to make up for it allows him to choose three boons.\nNa _k_ iketas, thereupon, full of faith and piety, chooses as his first boon\nthat his father should forgive him. Now it is clear that conduct of this kind\nwould not be possible in the case of one not convinced of the soul having an\nexistence independent of the body. For his second boon, again, he chooses the\nknowledge of a sacrificial fire, which has a result to be experienced only by\na soul that has departed from the body; and this choice also can clearly be\nmade only by one who knows that the soul is something different from the body.\nWhen, therefore, he chooses for his third boon the clearing up of his doubt as\nto the existence of the soul after death (as stated in v. 20), it is evident\nthat his question is prompted by the desire to acquire knowledge of the true\nnature of the highest Self--which knowledge has the form of meditation on the\nhighest Self--, and by means thereof, knowledge of the true nature of final\nRelease which consists in obtaining the highest Brahman. The passage,\ntherefore, is not concerned merely with the problem as to the separation of\nthe soul from the body, but rather with the problem of the Self freeing itself\nfrom all bondage whatever--the same problem, in fact, with which another\nscriptural passage also is concerned, viz. 'When he has departed there is no\nmore knowledge' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 12). The full purport of Na _k_ iketas'\nquestion, therefore, is as follows: When a man qualified for Release has died\nand thus freed himself from all bondage, there arises a doubt as to his\nexistence or non-existence--a doubt due to the disagreement of philosophers as\nto the true nature of Release; in order to clear up this doubt I wish to learn\nfrom thee the true nature of the state of Release.--Philosophers, indeed, hold\nmany widely differing opinions as to what constitutes Release. Some hold that\nthe Self is constituted\n\np. 271\n\nby consciousness only, and that Release consists in the total destruction of\nthis essential nature of the Self. Others, while holding the same opinion as\nto the nature of the Self, define Release as the passing away of Nescience\n(avidya). Others hold that the Self is in itself non-sentient, like a stone,\nbut possesses, in the state of bondage, certain distinctive qualities, such as\nknowledge, and so on. Release then consists in the total removal of all these\nqualities, the Self remaining in a state of pure isolation (kaivalya). Others,\nagain, who acknowledge a highest Self free from all imperfection, maintain\nthat through connexion with limiting adjuncts that Self enters on the\ncondition of an individual soul; Release then means the pure existence of the\nhighest Self, consequent on the passing away of the limiting adjuncts. Those,\nhowever, who understand the Vedanta, teach as follows: There is a highest\nBrahman which is the sole cause of the entire universe, which is antagonistic\nto all evil, whose essential nature is infinite knowledge and blessedness,\nwhich comprises within itself numberless auspicious qualities of supreme\nexcellence, which is different in nature from all other beings, and which\nconstitutes the inner Self of all. Of this Brahman, the individual souls--\nwhose true nature is unlimited knowledge, and whose only essential attribute\nis the intuition of the supreme Self--are modes, in so far, namely, as they\nconstitute its body. The true nature of these souls is, however, obscured by\nNescience, i.e. the influence of the beginningless chain of works; and by\n_Release_ then we have to understand that intuition of the highest Self, which\nis the natural state of the individual souls, and which follows on the\ndestruction of Nescience.--When Na _k_ iketas desires Yama graciously to teach\nhim the true nature of Release and the means to attain it, Yama at first tests\nhim by dwelling on the difficulty of comprehending Release, and by tempting\nhim with various worldly enjoyments. But having in this way recognised the\nboy's thorough fitness, he in the end instructs him as to the kind of\nmeditation on the highest Self which constitutes knowledge of the highest\nReality, as to the nature of Release--which consists in\n\np. 272\n\nreaching the abode of the highest Self--, and as to all the required details.\nThis instruction begins, I, 2, 12, 'The Ancient one who is difficult to see,'\n&c., and extends up to I, 3, 9. 'and that is the highest place of Vish _n_ u.'\n--It thus is an established conclusion that the 'eater' is no other than the\nhighest Self.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the eater.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13.
