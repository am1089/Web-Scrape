He\nhad a son, also, by name Nachiketas. Him, though still a child, faith entered,\nwhile the gifts were being led up.\n\nHe meditated:\n\nThey have drunk water, eaten grass, given up their milk, and lost their\nstrength. Joyless worlds, in truth, he gains, who offers these.\n\nHe addressed his father:\n\nTo whom, then, wilt thou give me? said he.\n\nTwice and thrice he asked him. To Death I give thee, said he.\n\n_Nachiketas ponders:_\n\nI go the first of many; I go in the midst of many. What is Death\'s work that\nhe will work on me to-day?\n\np. 6\n\nLook, as those that have gone before, behold so are those that shall come\nafter. As corn a mortal ripens, as corn he is born again.\n\n_Nachiketas comes to the House of Death; he speaks:_\n\nLike the Lord of Fire, a pure guest comes to the house. They offer him this\ngreeting. Bring water, O Death. Son of the Sun!\n\nHope and expectation, friendship, kind words, just and holy deeds, sons and\ncattle, this destroys, for the foolish man in whose house a pure guest dwells\nwithout food.\n\n_After three days Death comes. Death speaks:_\n\nAs thou hast dwelt three nights in my bowie, without food, thou, a pure guest\nand honourable--honour to thee, pure one, welfare to me--against this choose\nthou three wishes\n\n_Nachiketas speaks:_\n\nThat the descendant of Gotama may be at peace, well-minded, and with sorrow\ngone, towards me, O Death; that he may speak kindly to me when sent forth by\nthee; this, of the three, as my first wish I choose.\n\n_\'Death speaks:_\n\np. 7\n\nAs before will the son of Aruna, Uddalaka\'s son, be kind to thee, sent forth\nby me; by night will he sleep well, with sorrow gone, seeing thee freed from\nthe mouth of Death.\n\n_Nachiketas speaks:_\n\nIn the heaven-world there is no fear at all; nor art thou there, nor does he\nfear from old age. Crossing over both hunger and thirst, and going beyond\nsorrow, he exults in the heaven-world.\n\nThe heavenly fire thou knowest, Death, tell it to me, for I am faithful. The\nheaven-worlds enjoy deathlessness; this, as my second wish, I choose.\n\n_Death speaks:_\n\nTo thee I tell it; learn then from me, Nachiketas, finding the heavenly fire.\nKnow thou also the obtaining of unending worlds, the resting-place, for this\nis hidden in secret.\n\nHe told him then that fire, the beginning of the worlds, and the bricks of the\naltar, and how many and how they are. And he again spoke it back to him as it\nwas told; and Death, well-pleased, again addressed him.\n\np. 8\n\nThis is thy heavenly fire, O Nachiketas, which thou hast chosen as thy second\nwish. This fire of thine shall they proclaim. Choose now, Nachiketas, thy\nthird wish.\n\n_Nachiketas speaks:_\n\nThis doubt that there is of a man that has gone forth: "He exists," say some;\nand "He exists not," others say: a knowledge of this, taught by thee, this of\nmy wishes is the third wish.\n\n_Death speaks:_\n\nEven by the gods of old it was doubted about this; not easily knowable, and\nsubtle is this law. Choose, Nachiketas, another wish; hold me not to it, but\nspare me this.\n\n_Nachiketas speaks:_\n\nEven by the gods, thou sayest, it was doubted about this; and not easily\nknowable is it, O Death. Another teacher of it cannot be found like thee. No\nother wish is equal to this.\n\n_Death speaks:_\n\nChoose sons and grandsons of a hundred years, and much cattle, and elephants\nand gold and horses. Choose the great abode of the earth,\n\np. 9\n\nand for thyself live as many autumns as thou wilt.\n\nIf thou thinkest this an equal wish, choose wealth and length of days. Be thou\nmighty in the world, O Nachiketas; I make thee an enjoyer of thy desires.\n\nWhatsoever desires are difficult in the mortal world, ask all desires\naccording to thy will.\n\nThese beauties, with their chariots and lutes--not such as these are to be won\nby men--be waited on by them, my gifts. Ask me not of death, Nachiketas.\n\n_Nachiketas speaks:_\n\nTo-morrow these fleeting things wear out the vigour of a mortal\'s powers. Even\nthe whole of life is short; thine are chariots and dance and song.\n\nNot by wealth can a man be satisfied. Shall we choose wealth if we have seen\nthee? Shall we desire life while thou art master? But the wish I choose is\ntruly that.\n\nComing near to the unfading immortals, a fading mortal here below, and\nunderstanding, thinking on the\n\np. 10\n\nsweets of beauty and pleasure, who would rejoice in length of days?\n\nThis that they doubt about, O Death, what is in the great Beyond, tell me of\nthat. This wish that draws near to the mystery, Nachiketas chooses no other\nwish than that.\n\n_Death speaks:_\n\nThe better is one thing, the dearer is another thing; these two bind a man in\nopposite ways. Of these two, it is well for him who takes the better; he fails\nof his object, who chooses the dearer.\n\nThe better and the dearer approach a man; going round them, the sage discerns\nbetween them. The sage chooses the better rather than the dearer; the fool\nchooses the dearer, through lust of possession.\n\nThou indeed, pondering on dear and dearly-loved desires, O Nachiketas, hast\npassed them by. Not this way of wealth hast thou chosen, in which many men\nsink.\n\nFar apart are these two ways, un-wisdom and what is known as wisdom. I esteem\nNachiketas as one seeking wisdom, nor do manifold desires allure thee.\n\np. 11\n\nOthers, turning about in unwisdom, half-wise and thinking they are learned,\nfools, stagger, lagging in the way, like the blind led by the blind.\n\nThe great Beyond gleams not for the child, led away by the delusion of\npossessions. "This is the world, there is no other," he thinks, and so falls\nagain and again under my dominion.\n\nThat is not to be gained even for a hearing by many, and hearing it many\nunderstand it not. Wonderful is the seeker of it, blessed the receiver;\nwonderful is the knower of it, taught by the blessed.\n\nNot by the lower man is this, when declared, to be known even by much\nmeditation. There is no way to it unless told by the other, very subtle it,\nnor can it be debated by formal logic.\n\nThe understanding of this cannot be gained by debate; but it is declared by\nthe other, dearest, for a right understanding. Thou hast obtained it, for thou\nart steadfast in the truth; may a questioner like thee, Nachiketas, come us.\n\n"I know that what they call treasure\n\np. 12\n\nis unenduring; and by unlasting things what is lasting cannot be obtained.\nTherefore the Nachiketas fire was kindled by me, and for these unenduring\nthings I have gained that which endures."\n\nThus saying, and having beheld the obtaining of longings, the resting-place of\nthe world, the endlessness of desire, the shore where there is no fear,\ngreatly praised, and the wide-sung resting-place, thou, Nachiketas, wise in\nthy firmness, hast passed them by.\n\nBut that which is hard to see, which has entered the secret place, and is\nhidden in secret, the mystery, the ancient; understanding that bright one by\nthe path of union with the inner self, the wise man leaves exultation and\nsorrow behind.\n\nA mortal, hearing this and understanding it, drawing forth that subtle\nrighteous one from all things else, and obtaining it, rejoices, having gained\ngood cause for rejoicing; and the door to it is wide open, I think,\nNachiketas.\n\n_Nachiketas speaks:_\n\nWhat thou seest to be neither the law nor lawlessness, neither what\n\np. 13\n\ncommanded nor what is forbidden; neither what has been nor what shall be, tell\nme that.\n\n_Death speaks:_\n\nThat resting-place which all the Vedas proclaim, and all austerities declare;\nseeking for which they enter the service of the Eternal, that resting-place I\nbriefly tell to thee.\n\nIt is the unchanging Eternal, it is the unchanging supreme; having understood\nthat unchanging one, whatsoever a man wishes, that he gains. It is the\nexcellent foundation, the supreme foundation; knowing that foundation, a man\nis mighty in he eternal world.\n\nThe knower is never born nor dies, nor is it from anywhere, nor did it become\nanything. Unborn, eternal, immemorial, this ancient is not slain when the body\nis slain.\n\nIf the slayer thinks to slay it, if the sin thinks it is slain, neither of\nthem understand; this slays not nor is slain.\n\nSmaller than small, greater than great, this Self is hidden in the heart of\nman. He who has ceased from desire, and passed sorrow by, through\n\np. 14\n\nthe favour of that ordainer beholds the greatness of the Self.\n\nThough seated, it travels far; though at rest, it goes everywhere; who but me\nis worthy to know this bright one who is joy without rejoicing?\n\nUnderstanding this great lord the Self, bodiless in bodies, stable among\nunstable, the wise man cannot grieve. This Self is not to be gained by\nspeaking of it, nor by ingenuity, nor by much hearing. Whom this chooses, by\nhim it is gained, and the Self chooses his form as its own.\n\nHe who has ceased not from evil, who is not at peace, who stands not firm\nwhose emotions are not at rest, cannot obtain it by knowledge.\n\nPriest and Warrior are its food, its anointing is death; who knows truly where\nit is?\n\n_Death speaks:_\n\nThe knowers of the Eternal, those of the five fires, and of the triple fire of\nNachiketas, tell of the shadow and the fire-- _the soul and the spirit_\n--entering into the cave and drinking their reward in the World of good works,\non the higher path.\n\np. 15\n\nThis is the bridge of the sacrificers, the undying Eternal, the supreme, the\nfearless, the harbour of those who would cross over--may we master the fire of\nNachiketas.\n\nKnow that the Self is the lord of the chariot, the body verily is the chariot;\nknow that the soul is the charioteer, and emotion the reins.\n\nThey say that the bodily powers are the horses, and that the external world is\ntheir field. When the Self, the bodily powers and emotion are joined together,\nthis is the right enjoyer; thus say the wise.\n\nBut for the unwise, with emotion ever unrestrained, his bodily powers run away\nwith him, like the unruly horses of the charioteer.\n\nFor him who is wise, with emotion ever restrained, his bodily powers do not\nrun away with him, like the well-ruled horses of the charioteer.\n\nBut he who is unwise, restrains not emotion, and is ever impure, gains not\nthat resting-place, but returns to the world of birth and death.\n\nHe who is wise, restrains emotion, and is ever pure, gains that resting-dace\nfrom which he is not born again.\n\np. 16\n\nHe whose charioteer is wisdom, who grasps the reins--emotion--firmly, he\nindeed gains the end of the path, the supreme resting-place of the emanating\nPower.\n\nThe impulses are higher than the bodily powers; emotion is higher than the\nimpulses; soul is higher than emotion; higher than soul is the Self, the great\none.\n\nHigher than this great one is the unmanifest; higher than the unmanifest is\nspirit. Than spirit nothing is higher, for it is the goal, and the supreme\nway.\n\nThis is the hidden Self; in all beings it shines not forth; but is perceived\nby the piercing subtle soul of the subtle-sighted.\n\nLet the wise hold formative voice and emotion; let him hold them in the Self\nwhich is wisdom; let him hold this wisdom in the Self which is great; and this\nlet him hold in the Self which is peace.\n\nRise up! awake! and, having obtained your wishes, understand them.\n\nThe sages say this path is hard, difficult to tread as the keen edge of a\nrazor.\n\np. 17\n\nHe is released from the mouth of Death, having gained the lasting thing which\nis above the great, which has neither sound nor touch nor form nor change nor\ntaste nor smell, but is eternal, beginningless, endless.\n\nThis is the immemorial teaching of Nachiketas, declared by Death. Speaking it\nand hearing it the sage is mighty in the eternal world. Whosoever, being pure,\nshall cause this supreme secret to be heard, in the assembly of those who seek\nthe Eternal, or at the time of the union with those who have gone forth, he\nindeed builds for endlessness, he builds for endlessness.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: In the House of Death, Second Part](ftu05.htm)\n\n'
