Naraya _n_ a said :-- In Hira _n_ maya Var _s_ a, the Bhagavan is\nremaining in the form of Kurma, the Tortoise, as the Lord of Yoga. He is thus\npraised and worshipped by Aryama, the Ruler of the Pitris. Aryama said :-- Om\nnamo Bhagavate Akuparaya; (King of tortoises, sustaining the world) Obeisance\nto Thee,\n\n\n\np. 762\n\n\n\nthe Lord of all prosperities, in the form of Tortoise (Kurma); Thou art built\nof Sattva Gu _n_ a Incarnate; no one can make out where Thou dost dwell; Thou\nart not encompassed by Time; (Thou art in the Present, Past and Future); so\nobeisance to Thee. Thou dost pervade all things; we bow down to Thee. All are\nestablished in Thee; so obeisance to Thee. By Thy extraordinary Maya (power)\nThou hast made manifest this universe that is seen. This is Thy Form. It is by\nno means distinct from Thee. This Thy Form is seen in so many forms. So the\ntrue reality being not known like the mirage, these cannot be counted really\nspeaking, what is Thy form, no one can definitely say. The beings generated by\nheat and moisture (said of insects and worms), those that are born of eggs,\nfrom wombs and the plants and other moving, non-moving beings, the Devas, Ri\n_s_ is, Pitris, Bhutas, and these senses; the sky, the heavens, earth,\nmountains, rivers, oceans, islands, planets, and stars all these art Thou and\nThou alone. Thy name, form, and appearance, are as varied; and their numbers\ncannot be counted. Still, Kapila and others have determined their numbers, by\nthe knowledge of which Thou canst become visible to the Eye of Knowledge. Thy\nform and nature are determined by these Sankhyas ascertained by Kapila. So we\nbow down to Thee. Thus Aryama, and the other rulers of the Var _s_ a all\nunited sing, praise, and worship the Bhagavan Kurma Deva, the Controller of\nall and the Generator of all. All Hail to Thee! The Bhagavan Yaj\xc3\xb1a Puru _s_ a\nis manifest in Uttara Kuru Ma _nd_ ala in the form of \xc3\x82di Varaha. The Earth\nHerself worships Him always. The Goddess Earth praises Hari, the Yaj\xc3\xb1a Varaha,\nthe Destroyer of the Daityas and worships duly that Deva, with Her heart\nlotus, naturally devoted, rendered more devoted by Her attachment to the Lord.\n\n\n\n8-13. The Goddess Earth spoke :-- \xc2\x93Om Namo Bhagavate Mantratattva Li _n_ gaya\nYaj\xc3\xb1a Kratave\xc2\x94 I bow down to the Bhagavan, the Great Boar; Thou art Om; Thy\nreal form and nature can be known by only the Mantra and Tattva. Thou art\nYaj\xc3\xb1a and Kratu (sacrifice) incarnate; therefore all the great sacrifices are\nThy limbs. Thou art the Three Yugas (there being no Yaj\xc3\xb1a in the Satya Yuga);\nThou art that which is left as Pure, after doing Karma (so as to be fit for\nperforming Yaj\xc3\xb1as). So obeisance to Thee. The sages, versed in J\xc3\xb1ana and\nVij\xc3\xb1ana say that Thou art hidden in the body and in the senses as fire is\nhidden in the wood. So they, ardent to see Thee, seek for Thee with a\ndiscriminative and dispassionate mind, judging Karmas and their fruits; and\nthen Thy Nature is revealed, I bow down to Thee, Thy Form can be ascertained\nby the cause and effect of the Karmas and other Gu _n_ as of Maya, sense\nobjects, senses, actions, Devas, body, time, Ahamkara and others. I bow\n\n\n\np. 763\n\n\n\ndown to Thee, Those can see thus Thy form, whose mind is firmly established in\nThee, by their discrimination and Yama, Niyama, etc., and who have abandoned\nall sorts of fickleness and changeability of their tempers. So obeisance to\nThee. As iron goes attracted towards the magnet, so Maya dances before Thee\nwith Her Gu _n_ as and Her works in the way of the creation, preservation and\ndestruction of this universe; but Thou art totally indifferent to it. For the\nsake of the Jivas (embodied souls), desire comes to Thee, though Thou art not\nquite willing! Thou art the Witness of the Jivas and their Adri _st_ a (the\nFate). I bow down to Thee. The Yaj\xc3\xb1a Varaha, the Cause of this universe, has\nlifted me up from the Rasatala and placing me on His big tusks, has come out\nfrom the Pralaya, the great ocean, after overpowering in battle His enemy, the\npowerful Daitya, like an elephant, I bow down to that Controller of all, to\nThee. In the Kimpuru _s_ a Var _s_ a, the Bhagavan \xc3\x82di Puru _s_ a (the Prime\nMan), the Self-manifest, and the Lord of all, is residing in the form of Rama,\nthe son of Das'aratha and the Joy of the heart of Sita Devi.\n\n\n\n14-18. S'ri Hanumana thus spoke:-- \xc2\x93Om namo Bhagavate Uttama Slokaya\xc2\x94 I bow\ndown to the Bhagavan, who art sung by the excellent verses, purifying all. I\nbow down to Thee, the incarnate of modesty, good temper, vow and good signs;\nThy mind is always under control; Thou dost imitate, as Thy nature is good,\nthe actions of all persons; obeisance to Thee. Thou art the Supreme Place to\naward praise. Obeisance to Thee. Thou art Brahma _n_ ya Deva (in the creation\nof the universe), the high souled Person Mahapuru _s_ a. Thou gettest the\nFirst Share, above all the persons! Thou art the One Tattva and That Alone, as\nestablished in the Vedanta. The holy realisation is the only guide to it. This\nTattva dominates over all the Gu _n_ as. It can never be an object. Only by\npure intellect, It can be realised. There is no name, no form of It. It is\nalways beyond the pale of Ahamkara. I take refuge to this Tattva, the most\nPeaceful, with my body and mind. Thy incarnation in human shape in this world\nis not simply for killing Rava _n_ a but for giving instructions to the\nmortals. The contact with woman and the suffering thereof are very difficult\nto avoid; to give this lesson also He took this incarnation, He Who is merged\nin enjoying the Supreme Bliss of His Own Nature and He Who is the Lord of all,\nhow can He suffer miseries in the bereavement of Sita. He is the best friend\nand the very \xc3\x82tman of those who have conquered their minds and senses.\nEspecially He is the receptacle of all the qualities and is in enjoyment of\nother divine extraordinary powers. So He is not attached to the worldly\nobjects. How can the delusion due to His wife come and darken Him? and why\nwill He send Lak _s_ ma _n_ a\n\n\n\np. 764\n\n\n\nin exile? He is the Mahat Tattva and the Parama Puru _s_ a; so good birth,\nbeauty, intelligence, oratory or good form, nothing can please Him. Bhakti\n(devotion) can only attract Him. If that be not the case, then why will He,\nthe elder of Lak _s_ ma _n_ a, the Bhagavan, the son of Das'aratha make\nfriendship with us, the wanderers of the forest and who are by nature, not the\nreceptacles of any beauty, etc. So everyone, be he a Sura or Asura, man, or\nnot man, should worship the Hari manifest in Rama, in the human body with all\nhis heart. He is so good that if anybody worships Him even to a very small\nextent, He always considers it to be much; what more can be said than this\nthat He took all the inhabitants of Kos'ala to Heaven!\n\n\n\n19-20. Naraya _n_ a said :-- Thus Hanuman, the best of monkeys, sings the\npraises and worships duly in Kimpuru _s_ a Var _s_ a, the lotus-eyed Rama,\ntruthful, and determined in his vows. He who hears this wonderful description\nof Rama, is freed of all his sins and goes with his body pure to the abode of\nRama.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Tenth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the description of Bhuvanako\n_s_ a in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk08ch11.htm)\n\n"
