He has very kindly enabled me to\nmake use, before they were published, of the results of his investigations,\nwhich he has laid down in the introduction to his translation of Gobhila.\nWhile I wish, therefore, to acknowledge the obligation under which Prof.\nKnauer has thus laid me, I must try, on the other side, to state my own\nopinion as to the problem in question, which in some points differs from, or\nis even opposed to, the theory by which Prof. Knauer has tried to solve it.\n\nTo begin with that side of the question regarding which there can scarcely be\nany doubt: it is certain, I believe, that Gobhila supposes the Mantra-Brahma\n_n_ a to be known to the students of his Sutra. The reasons which show this\nare obvious enough 1. By far the greater part of the Mantras of which Gobhila\nquotes the first words, are not found in the Sama-veda nor, for the most part,\nin any other Vedic Sa _m_ hita, except in the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a, in which\nthey stand in exactly the same order in which they are referred to by Gobhila.\nThe descriptions of the G _ri_ hya sacrifices by Gobhila would have been\nmeaningless and useless, and the sacrificer who had to perform his domestic\nceremonies according to the ritual of Gobhila, would have been unable to do\nso, unless he had known those Mantras as contained in the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a.\nAnd not only the Mantras, but also the order in which the Mantras stood, for\nSutras such as, for instance, Gobh. II, 1, 10 ('With the two following verses\nhe should wash,' &c.), would have no meaning except for one who had studied\nthe Mantra-Brahma _n_ a which alone could show which 'the two following\nverses' were.\n\nThere are, consequently, two possibilities: either the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a\nexisted before the Gobhiliya-sutra, or the two works have been composed\ntogether and on one common plan. It is the first of these alternatives which\nProf. Knauer maintains; I wish, on the other hand, to call\n\np. 5\n\nthe attention of Vedic scholars to some facts which seem to me to render the\nsecond more probable.\n\nA great part of the Mantras which have to be recited, according to Gobhila, at\nthe performance of the G _ri_ hya ceremonies, are not given in the Mantra-\nBrahma _n_ a, but they are either found in the Sama-veda-Sa _m_ hita and then\ntheir Pratikas are quoted by Gobhila, or they are cited by Gobhila in extenso.\nThus for the ceremonies described in the first Prapa _th_ aka of Gobhila, such\nas the morning and evening offerings and the sacrifices of the full and new\nmoon, the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a gives, with one single exception, no Mantras at\nall 1; but those Mantras, most of which consist only of a few words, are given\nby Gobhila only. It is scarcely to be believed that in a Sa _m_ hita which had\nto contain the Mantras required for the performance of the G _ri_ hya\nsacrifices, the Mantras belonging to the two daily and the two fortnightly\nsacrifices, which occupy one of the first places among all G _ri_ hya\nceremonies and are treated of accordingly in all G _ri_ hya-sutras, should\nhave been omitted, unless that Sa _m_ hita was intended to stand in relation\nto another text by which that deficiency was supplied: and the Gobhiliya-sutra\nexactly supplies it. Prof. Knauer thinks that those Mantras were omitted\nbecause they had already found their place in the _S_ rauta ritual; but we\nmust not forget that in the _S_ rauta ritual o f the Sama-vedins neither the\nAgnihotra nor the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa sacrifices, which are performed\nwithout the assistance of priests of the Udgat _ri_ class, are treated of.\nMoreover the one Mantra to which we have already alluded 2, the single one\nwhich corresponds in the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a to the first book of Gobhila,\nseems to me quite sufficient to show that it was not the intention of the\ncompiler of that text to disregard that group of sacrifices; he gave that\nMantra only, because the other Mantras, consisting of but a few words, were\ngiven in extenso in the Gobhila text. The Mantra of which we speak, belongs to\nthe description\n\np. 6\n\nof the paryuksha _n_ a of the sacrificial fire. The sacrificer pours out water\nto the south, the west, and the north of the fire, with the Mantras,\n'Adite\xe0\xa4\xbdnumanyasva,' 'Anumate\xe0\xa4\xbdnumanyasva,' 'Sarasvaty anumanyasva'; then he\nsprinkles water round the fire once or three times with a longer Mantra, 'Deva\nSavita _h_ prasuva ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am prasuva ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ apatim bhagaya. Divyo\ngandharva _h_ ketapu _h_ keta _m_ na _h_ punatu. Va _k_ aspatir va _k_ a _m_\nna _h_ svadatu.' This last one is the Mantra given in its entirety in the\nMantra-Brahma _n_ a, while Gobhila 1 has only the first words of it. To assume\nhere that the author of the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a knew only of that one Mantra,\nand that at the time of Gobhila the custom of the Sama-vedins had undergone a\nchange, so that they used four Mantras instead of the one, would be, in my\nopinion, an artificial and not very probable way of explaining the facts; a\nmuch more natural supposition would be, I believe, that the Sutra and the\nMantra-Brahma _n_ a describe one and the same form of the ceremony, so that\nthe Brahma _n_ a, by omitting the short Mantras, which were given in the Sutra\nin their entirety, implicitly refers to the Sutra, and the Sutra, on the other\nhand, by quoting only the first words of the longer Mantra, refers to the\nBrahma _n_ a in which the full text of that Mantra was given.\n\nAmong the numerous ceremonies described by Gobhila, which could furnish the\noccasion for similar remarks, we select only two: the rites performed in the\nevening of the wedding-day 2, and the sacrifice on the full-moon day of \xc3\x82 _s_\nvayu _g_ a 3. The bridegroom, having carried away his bride from her home,\ntakes her to the house of a Brahma _n_ a, and when the stars have appeared, he\nmakes six oblations with the six verses lekhasandhishu pakshmasu (Mantra-Br.\nI, 3, 1-6): these are given in the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a, and Gobhila has only\nthe Pratika. Then follow two short Mantras: the bride, to whom the polar-star\nhas been shown, addresses that star with the words: dhruvam asi dhruvaha _m_\npatikule bhuyasam amushyasav iti;\n\np. 7\n\nand when she sees the star Arundhati, she says, ruddhaham asmi. As the full\nwording of these Mantras is given by Gobhila, they are omitted in the Brahma\n_n_ a. Finally the bridegroom recites over the bride the _Ri_ _k_ dhruva dyaur\ndhruva p _ri_ thivi, &c.; this we find in the M.-B. (I, 3, 7), the Pratika\nonly being quoted by Gobhila. If one were to suppose here that in the two\ntexts two different stages in the development of this ceremony are\nrepresented, so that only the Mantras lekhasandhishu and dhruva dyau _h_ would\nbelong to the more ancient form of it, while the Mantras dhruvam asi and\nruddhaham asmi would have been introduced at a later time, it may perhaps not\nbe possible to disprove, in the strictest sense of the word, such an opinion.\nBut I think the data we have given point to another solution of the problem\nwhich, if not the only admissible, is yet the most probable and natural one.\nGobhila gave the full wording of the shorter Mantras with which the\ndescription of the ceremony could be interwoven without becoming obscure or\ndisproportionate; the longer Mantras would have interrupted, rather tediously\nand inconveniently, the coherency of his ritual statements; so he separated\nthem from the rest of his work and made a separate Sa _m_ hita of them. It is\ntrue that there are some exceptions to the rule that all long Mantras are\ngiven in the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a and all short Mantras only in the Sara: on\nthe one hand, there are some Mantras of considerable extent that are given by\nGobhila and omitted in the Brahma _n_ a, thus, for instance, the Mantra yady\nasi saumi used at a preparatory ceremony that belongs to the Pu _m_ savana 1.\nOn the other hand, a number of short Mantras which Gobhila gives in extenso,\nare found nevertheless also in the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a: such is the case, for\ninstance, with many of the Mantras belonging to the worship of the Fathers,\nGobhila IV, 2. 3, Mantra-Br. II, 3.\n\np. 8\n\n[paragraph continues] It appears then, that allowance must be made for a\ncertain inconsistency or carelessness in the distribution of the material\nbetween the two texts: and such an assumption will easily be allowed by any\none who does not entertain very exaggerated ideas as to the care and\nreflection which presided over the composition of the Sutra texts.\n\nI will add only a few words concerning a second G _ri_ hya ceremony, which\ncalls for the same sort of comment as the rites which have just been\ndiscussed. For the offering on the day of the full moon, Gobhila prescribes\n(III, 8, 2) first the verse a no mitravaru _n_ a, second the verse ma nastoke.\nThe Mantra-Brahma _n_ a (II, 1, 8) has the second of these verses only, not\nthe first: conversely, the first verse alone, and not the second, is to be\nfound in the Sa _m_ hita of the Sama-veda (I, 220). We could hardly assume, as\nI think, that the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a presupposed another form of the rite\ndiffering from Gobhila's; we should be much more inclined to consider the\nleaving out of that matter, which was contained in other texts of the Sama-\nveda, as a proof that the compiler of the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a assumed that\nthose texts were known 1.\n\nAnd this brings me to one of Prof. Knauer's conjectures concerning the Mantra-\nBrahma _n_ a which I have not yet touched. According to tradition we consider\nthe Mantra-Brahma _n_ a as belonging to the Sama-veda; in the Calcutta edition\nit is designated as the 'Sama-vedasya Mantra-Brahma _n_ am.' Prof. Knauer\nthinks that it is doubtful whether the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a belonged to the\nSama-veda originally. He conjectures 2 'that it existed already in the\n\np. 9\n\nperiod during which the separate schools were as yet in the process of\nsifting, when there were as yet no Sama-vedists in the later and stricter\nsense of the term 1.' For out of 249 Mantras of the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a there\nare only four which are found in the Sama-veda 2, as Prof. Knauer has shown,\nwhile a much greater number of these Mantras. occur in the other Vedic Sa _m_\nhitas. I should be inclined to conclude the other way: just because the author\nof the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a presupposed a knowledge of the Sa _m_ hita of the\nSama-veda, but not of the other Vedas\xc2\x97or in other words because he destined\nhis work for Sama-vedins, he did not need to repeat what was in the Sama-veda,\nbut was compelled to incorporate in his compilation the Mantras out of the\n_Ri_ g-veda or of the Ya _g_ ur-veda 3. Moreover, I would draw the same\nconclusions from the Mantras cited by Gobhila which are absent in the Mantra-\nBrahma _n_ a, as I did from the Mantras which occur in the Mantra-Brahma _n_\na, but are not to be found in the Sama-veda. Those Mantras are all to be found\nin the Sama-veda with the exception of those which Gobhila has in extenso, and\nwhich therefore could be omitted in the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a. If we examine the\nthirteen Mantras collected by Prof. Knauer (p. 29), we find that in the case\nof nine of them the passage of the Sama-veda (always of the first \xc3\x82r _k_ ika\nof the Sama-veda) where they are to be found is quoted by Prof. Knauer.\n\np. 10\n\nThe four other cases are:\n\n_ri_ _k_ a _m_ sama ya _g_ amahe, Gobh. III, 2, 48.\n\nta _k_ _k_ akshur devahitam, III, 8, 5.\n\nsam anya yanti, III, 9, 7.\n\npra _g_ apataye, IV, 7, 36.\n\n[paragraph continues] Of these Mantras the first is contained in the Sama-veda\n(I, 369) just as the nine first-mentioned ones; the second is quoted by\nGobhila in extenso; the third is to be found in the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka division of\nthe Sama-veda I (vol. ii, p. 292, ed. Bibl. Ind.); in the fourth finally the\ntext is corrupt; it is intended for the verse out of the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a\nPra _g_ apate na tvad etany anya _h_. Thus the four apparent exceptions all\nvanish, and we have in the Mantras which are absent in the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a\na new proof that this text belongs to the literature of the Sama-veda 1.\n\nThus, according to my view, we may describe the origin of the Mantra-Brahma\n_n_ a as follows. The Sama-veda contained in its Sa _m_ hita a much smaller\nnumber of Mantras applicable to the G _ri_ hya rites than either the _Ri_\ng-veda or the Ya _g_ ur-veda; the peculiar character of the Saman texts,\nintended for musical recitations at the most important sacrificial offerings,\nwas quite remote from the character of formulas suitable for the celebration\nof a wedding, for the birth of a child, for the consecration of fields and\nflocks. Hence it is that, to a much greater extent than \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana or\nParaskara, Gobhila mentions Mantras for which a reference to the Sa _m_ hita\nwas not sufficient; and this led to the compiling of a separate Sa _m_ hita of\nsuch G _ri_ hya-mantras, which presupposes the G _ri_ hya-sutra, just as the\nlatter presupposes this Sa _m_ hita. The almost perfect agreement of the\nMantra-Brahma _n_ a with Gobhila furnishes a valuable\n\np. 11\n\nwarrant for the good preservation of the two texts; of small discrepancies I\nhave noted only two: Mantra-Brahma _n_ a I, 6, 15, the formula agantra\nsamaganmahi is given for the ceremony of the Upanayana, while Gobhila does not\nprescribe this Mantra for this ceremony, although other G _ri_ hya texts do;\nand secondly, the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a II, 5, 1-7 does not consist of six\nverses as Gobh. IV, 6, 5-6 allows us to assume, but of seven verses.\n\nIn concluding this introduction notice is to be drawn to the fact that the\ntext of Gobhila has preserved for us the traces of a division differing from\nthe one into four Prapa _th_ akas which is handed down by tradition: in a\nnumber of places certain Sutras or the last words of certain Sutras are set\ndown twice, a well-known way of indicating the close of a chapter. This\nrepetition, besides occurring at the end of the first, third, and fourth Prapa\n_th_ aka (not at the end of the second), is to be found in the following\nplaces which become more frequent towards the close of the work: I, 4, 31;\nIII, 6, 15; IV, 1, 22; 4, 34; 5, 34; 6, 16.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[3:1](sbe30003.htm#fr_80) The term 'Sa _m_ hita of the Sama-veda' ought to be\nunderstood here in its narrower sense as denoting the so-called first book of\nthe Sa _m_ hita, the _Kh_ anda-ar _k_ ika or collection of Yoni verses (see on\nthe relation between this collection and the second book my remarks in the\nZeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, vol. xxxviii, pp.\n464. seq.). Prof. Knauer in his list of the verses quoted by Gobhila (p. 29 of\nhis translation of the Gobhiliya-G _ri_ hya) states that Sama-veda II, 1138 (=\nI, 276) and 1139 is quoted in Gobhila III, 9, 6, but an accurate analysis of\nthe words of Gobhila shows that the verse II, 1139 is not referred to, so that\nonly the verse II, 1138 remains, which occurs also in the first book of the Sa\n_m_ hita. The 'dvika' of which Gobhila speaks in that Sutra is not a dv _ri_\n_k_ a, but, as the commentators rightly understand it (see Knauer's edition of\nthe text, p. xii), it is a dyad of Samans or melodies, the two Kavasha Samans\nwhich are based on the text I, 276, and are given in the great Sama-veda\nedition of Satyavrata Sama _s_ ramin, vol. i, pp. 566, 567.\n\n[3:2](sbe30003.htm#fr_81) In the same way the G _ri_ hya-sutra of \xc3\x82pastamba\nstands in connection with a similar collection of G _ri_ hya verses and\nformulas, the \xc3\x82pastambiya-Mantrapa _th_ a.\n\n[4:1](sbe30003.htm#fr_82) Cf. Knauer's Introduction, pp. 24, 31 seq.\n\n[5:1](sbe30003.htm#fr_83) Cf. Knauer's translation, Introduction, p. 25.\n\n[5:2](sbe30003.htm#fr_84) Mantra-Brahma _n_ a I, 1, 1.\n\n[6:1](sbe30003.htm#fr_85) Gobh. I, 3, 4.\n\n[6:2](sbe30003.htm#fr_86) Gobh. II, 3, 17 seq.\n\n[6:3](sbe30003.htm#fr_87) Gobh. III, 8.\n\n[7:1](sbe30003.htm#fr_88) Gobh. II, 6, 7. It is possible, though we have no\npositive evidence for this conjecture, that such statements regarding\npreparatory or auxiliary ceremonies may here and there have been added to the\nSutra collection in a later time. The Khadira-G _ri_ hya (II, 2, 20) has\ninstead of that long Mantra only a few words which in the Gobhiliya-sutra\nstand at the end of it.\n\n[8:1](sbe30003.htm#fr_89) Any one who holds the view that the ritualistic\nformulas, which are not contained in the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a, represent later\nextensions of the ceremonies in question, will do well to notice how in any\none of the offerings of the _S_ rauta ritual which we possess, both in the old\ndescription of the Sa _m_ hita and Brahma _n_ a texts, and in the more recent\ndescription of the Sutra texts, Mantras have been added in more recent times\nto the former ones. I think that it would be difficult to draw from such\nobservations any argument of analogy calculated to support Dr. Knauer's\nopinion as to the relation of the Mantras in Gobhila and in the Mantra-Brahma\n_n_ a.\n\n[8:2](sbe30003.htm#fr_90) Introduction to his translation, p. 23.\n\n[9:1](sbe30003.htm#fr_91) Besides the reasons given below in opposition to\nthis conjecture, I may be permitted to point out that this hypothesis is\ncontrary to the whole chronology of the G _ri_ hya literature which we\nendeavoured to arrive at in the general introduction. It is a priori extremely\nimprobable that there was a G _ri_ hya Sa _m_ hita at a time when there was as\nyet no Sama-veda.\n\n[9:2](sbe30003.htm#fr_92) Viz. (according to Prof. Knauer's alphabetical list\nof the Mantras of the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a) ima _m_ stomam arhate, M.-B. II, 4,\ns = Sv. I, 66; II, 414; tat savitur vare _n_ yam, M.-B. I, 6, 29 = Sv. II,\n812; bharamedhmam, M.-B. II, 4, 3 = Sv. II, 415; _s_ akema tva, M.-B. II, 4, 4\n= Sv. II, 416.\n\n[9:3](sbe30003.htm#fr_93) Notice that of the four exceptional cases which we\nput together in the previous note, three cases are Mantras which are found\nonly in the second \xc3\x82r _k_ ika of the Sama-veda, not in the first (cf. above,\np. 3, note 1). The fourth verse (M.-B. II, 4, 2) is to be found in the first\n\xc3\x82r _k_ ika, it is true, but it stands closely related to two verses which are\nnot to be found in that \xc3\x82r _k_ ika (M.-B. II, 4, 3. 4). This explains why it\nwas put into the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a, as well as those two verses.\n\n[10:1](sbe30003.htm#fr_94) One will not object that the Mantras in question\nwhich are absent in the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a are all to be found in the _Ri_\ng-veda as well as in the Sama-veda. Since almost all the verses of the Sama-\nveda are taken from the _Ri_ g-veda there is nothing astonishing about this.\nBefore one could conclude from this that the Mantra-Brahma _n_ a belongs to\nthe _Ri_ g-veda he would have to answer the question, How is it that the\nverses in question are always verses of the Rim veda which are repeated in the\nSama-veda? Why are there not among them verses which are not to be found in\nthe Sama-veda?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1](sbe30004.htm)\n\n"
