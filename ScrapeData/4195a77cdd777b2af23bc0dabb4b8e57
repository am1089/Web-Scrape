Here  \nI cut the necks of Rakshasas away. Barley art thou.  \nBar off from us our haters, bar our enemies.  \nThee for heaven, thee for earth, thee for the welkin. Pure  \nbe the worlds, the Fathers\xc2\x92 dwelling-places. Thou art the  \nhabitation of the Fathers.  \n2 Thou art a leader, easy, to Unnetars, of access. Know  \nthis. It will stand upon thee.  \nSavitar, God, anoint thee with sweet butter. Thee for the  \nplants laden with goodly fruitage!  \nThou with thy top hast touched the sky, hast with thy  \nmiddle filled the air, and steadied with thy base the earth.  \n3 Those seats of thine which we desire to visit, where there  \nare many-horned and nimble. oxen,  \nThere, of a truth, was mightily imprinted the loftiest step  \nof widely-striding Vishnu.  \nI close thee in, the winner of the Brahmans, winner of  \nNobles and abundant riches.  \nStrengthen the Brahmans, strengthen thou the Nobles,  \nstrengthen our vital power, strengthen our offspring.  \n4 Look ye on Vishnu's works, whereby the Friend of Indra,  \nclose-allied,  \nHath let his holy ways be seen.\n\np. 45\n\n5 The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where  \nVishnu is,  \nLaid as it were an eye in heaven.  \n6 Thou art invested. Heavenly hosts invest thee! Riches of  \nmen invest this Sacrificer!  \nHeaven's son art thou. This is thine earthly station. Thine  \nis the beast whose home is in the forest.  \n7 Encourager art thou. The hosts of heaven have come to  \nyearning Gods, the best conductors.  \nGod Tvashtar, make the wealth of cattle quiet. Delightful  \nto the taste be thine oblations.  \n8 Joy, wealthy ones! Brihaspati, save our riches.  \nI bind thee with the noose of holy Order, thou offering to  \nthe Gods. Bold be the Slayer.  \n9 By impulse of God Savitar I bind thee, with arms of Asvins  \nand with hands of Pushan, thee welcome unto Agni and  \nto Soma.  \nThee for the waters, thee for plants. Thy mother grant  \nthee permission, and thy father, brother born of one dam,  \nthy friend, thy herd-companion. I sprinkle thee welcome  \nto Agni-Soma.  \n10 Drinker art thou of water. May the Waters, the Goddesses,  \nadd sweetness to the oblation prepared for Gods, even  \nthough already sweetened.\n\np. 46\n\nThy breath join wind, thy limbs those meet for worship, the  \nsacrifice's lord the boon he prays for.  \n11 Balmed, both of you, with butter, guard the cattle. Grant,  \nRich! the Sacrificer's prayer. Approach thou.  \nMeeting with heavenly Wind, from air's mid-region. Be  \nthou united with this offering's body.  \nO Great One, lead the sacrifice's master on to a sacrifice of  \nloftier order. All-hail to Gods! To Gods All-hail!  \n12 Become no serpent, thou, become no viper. To thee,  \nO widely-spread, be adoration.  \nAdvance, unhindered, on thy way. To rivers of butter  \nmove along the paths of Order.  \n13 Bear the oblation to the Gods, ye Waters celestial and pure  \nand well-provided. May we become providers well-provided.  \n14 I cleanse thy voice, thy breath, thine eye, thine ear, thy  \nnavel, and thy feet, thy sexual organ, and thy rump.  \n15 Let thy mind, voice, and breath increase in fulness, thine  \neye be fuller, and thine ear grow stronger.  \nWhatever there is in thee sore or wounded, may that be  \nfilled for thee, cleansed and united.  \nBlest be the days. Plant, guard! Axe, do not harm him.  \n16 Thou art the demons\xc2\x92 share. Expelled are demons. Here  \nI tread down; here I repel the demons; here lead the  \ndemons into lowest darkness.\n\np. 47\n\nInvest, ye two, the heaven and earth with fatness.  \nO Vayu, eagerly enjoy the droppings. Let Agni eagerly  \nenjoy the butter. All-hail!  \nGo, both of you, by Svaha consecrated, to \xc3\x9brdhvanabhas,  \noffspring of the Maruts.  \n17 Ye Waters, wash away this stain and whatsoever taint be here,  \nEach sinful act that I have done, and every harmless curse  \nof mine.  \nMay Waters rid me of that guilt, and Pavamana set me free.  \n18 Be they united, with the Mind thy mind, and with the Breath  \nthy breath.  \nThou quiverest. Let Agni make thee ready. Waters have  \nwashed together all thy juices.  \nThee for the Wind's rush, for the speed of Pushan. From  \nheated vapour may it reel and totter,\xc2\x97the disconcerted  \nhatred of our foemen.  \n19 Ye drinkers-up of fatness, drink the fatness; drink up the  \ngravy, drinkers of the gravy! Thou art the oblation of the  \nair's mid-region. All-hail!  \nThe regions, the fore-regions, the by-regions, the intermediate  \nand the upper regions,\xc2\x97to all the regions Hail!  \n20 In every limb is Indra's out-breath seated, in every limb is  \nIndra's in-breath settled.  \nGod Tvashtar, let thine ample forms be blended, that what  \nwears different shapes may be one-fashioned.  \nTo please thee let thy friends, mother and father, joy over  \nthee as to the Gods thou goest.\n\np. 48\n\n21 Go to the sea. All-hail! Go to the air. All-hail! Go to God  \nSavitar. All hail!  \nGo thou to Mitra-Varuna. All-hail! Go thou to Day and  \nNight. All-hail!  \nGo to the Metres. till-hail! Go to Heaven and Earth. All-hail!  \nGo to the sacrifice. All-hail! Go to Soma. All-hail!  \nGo to the heavenly ether. All-hail! Go to Vaisvanara  \nAgni. All hail! Bestow upon me mind and heart.  \nThy smoke mount to the sky, to heaven thy lustre. Fill  \nthou the spacious earth full with thine ashes.  \n22 Harm not the Waters, do the Plants no damage. From every  \nplace, King Varuna, thence save us.  \nTheir saying that we swear our oath by sacred cows, by  \nVaruna,  \nO Varuna, save us therefrom.  \nTo us let Waters and let Plants be friendly; to him who  \nhates us, whom we hate, unfriendly.  \n23 These waters teem with sacred food: rich in that food, one  \nlongs for them.  \nRich be the holy rite therein. In sacred food be Surya rich.  \n24 I set you down in Agni's seat whose home is indestructible.  \nIndra-and-Agni's share are ye, Mitra-and-Varuna's share are  \nye.  \nThe share of all the Gods are ye.  \nMay waters gathered near the Sun, and those wherewith the  \nSun is joined,  \nSpeed on this sacred rite of ours.  \n23 Thee for the heart, thee for the mind, thee for the heaven,  \nthee for the Sun.  \nBear up erect to heaven, to Gods, this rite these sacrificial  \ncalls.\n\np. 49\n\n26 Descend, O Soma, King, to all thy people. Down, unto thee,  \ngo, one and all, thy people!  \nMay Agni with his fuel hear my calling. Hear it the Waters  \nand the Bowls, Divine Ones! Hear, Stones, as knowing  \nsacrifice, my calling. May the God Savitar hear mine  \ninvocation. All hail!  \n27 Waters Divine, your wave, the Waters\xc2\x92 offspring, fit for oblation,  \npotent, most delightful  \nUpon those Gods among the Gods bestow it, who drink the  \npure, of whom ye are the portion. All-hail!  \n28 Drawing art thou: I draw thee up that Ocean ne\xc2\x92er may  \nwaste or wane.  \nLet waters with the waters, and the plants commingle with  \nthe plants.  \n29 That man is lord of endless strength whom thou protectest  \nin the fight,  \nAgni, or urgest to the fray.  \n30 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,  \nwith the hands of Pushan.  \nFree with thy gifts art thou. Perform for Indra this deep,  \nmost excellently ordered worship.  \nWith the most noble bolt I pay the worship enriched with  \nstrengthening food and milk and sweetness.  \nYe are Nigrabhya waters. heard by Deities: make me content.\n\np. 50\n\n31 Content my mind, content my speech, content my breath,  \ncontent mine eye, content mine ear, content my soul, content  \nmy progeny, content my herds, content the troops  \nof men about me: never may the bands of men about me  \nsuffer thirst.  \n32 For Indra girt by Vasus and accompanied by Rudras, thee.  \nFor Indra with \xc3\x82dityas, thee. For Indra foe-destroyer,  \nthee. Thee for the Soma-bringing Hawk. For plenty-giving  \nAgni, thee.  \n33 Soma, what light there is of thine in heaven, what on the  \nearth, what in mid-air's wide region,  \nTherewith give broad space to the Sacrificer for his enrichment:  \nComfort thou the giver.  \n34 Auspicious are ye, conquerors of Vritra, formed for bestowing  \nwealth, the Immortal's Consorts.  \nLead to the Gods this sacrifice, Divine Ones! and at our invitation  \ndrink of Soma.  \n35 Be not afraid; shake not with terror. Take thou strength.  \nYe two Bowls, being firm, stay firm, and take ye strength.  \nMishap\xc2\x97not Soma\xc2\x97hath been killed.  \n36 East, west, north, south, from every side to meet thee let  \nthe regions run.  \nFill him, O Mother, let the noble meet together.  \n37 Thou, verily, O Mightiest, as God shalt gladden mortal man.  \nO Bounteous Lord, there is no comforter but thou. Indra,  \nI speak my words to thee.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book VII](wyvbk07.htm)\n\n"
