The passages translated in\nthis Book form Section x., portions of Sections xvi., xvii., and xxvi., and\nthe whole of Section xxvii. of Book xi. of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## KURU WOMEN VISIT THE BATTLE-FIELD\n\nSpake the ancient Dhrita-rashtra, father of a hundred sons,  \nSonless now and sorrow-stricken, dark his ebbing life-tide runs:\n\n"Gods fulfil my life\'s last wishes! Henchmen, yoke my royal car,  \nDhrita-rashtra meets his princes in the silent field of war,\n\nSpeed unto the Queen Gandhari, to the dames of Kuru\'s house,  \nTo each dear departed warrior wends his fair and faithful spouse!"\n\nQueen Gandhari sorrow-laden with the ancient Pritha came,  \nAnd each weeping widowed princess and each wailing childless dame,\n\nAnd they saw the hoary monarch, father of a perished race,  \nFresh and loud awoke their sorrow, welling tears suffused their face,\n\nGood Vidura ever gentle whispered comfort unto all,  \nPlaced the dames within their chariots, left Hastina\'s palace hall!\n\nLoud the wail of woe and sorrow rose from every Kuru house,  \nChildren wept beside their mothers for each widowed royal spouse,\n\nVeiled dwellers of the palace, scarce the gods their face had seen,  \nHeedless now through mart and city sped each widowed childless queen,\n\nFrom their royal brow and bosom gem and jewel cast aside,  \nLoose their robes and loose their tresses, quenched their haughty queenly\npride!\n\nSo when falls the antlered monarch, struck by woe and sudden fear  \nIssuing from their snowy mountains listless stray the dappled deer,\n\nSo when smit by sudden panic, milk-white mares that scour the plain,  \nWildly toss their flowing tresses, shake their soft and glossy mane!\n\nClinging to her weeping sister wept each dame in cureless pain,  \nFor the lord the son or father in the deathful battle slain,\n\nWept and smote her throbbing bosom and in bitter anguish wailed,  \nTill her senses reeled in sorrow, till her woman\'s reason failed!\n\nVeiled queens and bashful maidens, erst they shunned the public eye,  \nBlush nor shame suffused their faces as they passed the city by,\n\nGentle-bosomed, kindly hearted, erst they wiped each other\'s tear,  \nNow by common sorrow laden knew no sister\'s words of cheer!\n\nWith this troop of wailing women, deep in woe, disconsolate,  \nSlow the monarch of the Kurus passed Hastina\'s outer gate,\n\nMen from stall and loom and anvil, men of every guild and trade,  \nLeft the city with the monarch, through the open country strayed,\n\nAnd a universal sorrow filled the air and answering sky,  \nAs when ends the mortal\'s Yuga and the end of world is nigh!\n\n## II\n\n## GANDHARI\'S LAMENT FOR THE SLAIN\n\nStainless Queen and stainless woman, ever righteous ever good,  \nStately in her mighty sorrow on the field Gandhari stood!\n\nStrewn with skulls and clotted tresses, darkened by the stream of gore,  \nWith the limbs of countless warriors is the red field covered o\'er,\n\nElephants and steeds of battle, car-borne chiefs untimely slain,  \nHeadless trunks and heads dissevered fill the red and ghastly plain,\n\nAnd the long-drawn howl of jackals o\'er the scene of carnage rings,  \nAnd the vulture and the raven flap their dark and loathsome wings,\n\nFeasting on the blood of warriors foul _Pisachas_ fill the air,  \nViewless forms of hungry _Rakshas_ limb from limb the corpses tear!\n\nThrough this scene of death and carnage was the ancient monarch led,  \nKuru dames with faltering footsteps stepped amidst the countless dead,\n\nAnd a piercing wail of anguish burst upon the echoing plain,  \nAs they saw their sons or fathers, brothers, lords, amidst the slain,\n\nAs they saw the wolves of jungle feed upon the destined prey,  \nDarksome wanderers of the midnight prowling in the light of day!\n\nShriek of pain and wail of anguish o\'er the ghastly field resound,  \nAnd their feeble footsteps falter and they sink upon the ground,\n\nSense and life desert the mourners as they faint in common grief,  \nDeath-like swoon succeeding sorrow yields a moment\'s short relief!\n\nThen a mighty sigh of anguish from Gandhari\'s bosom broke,  \nGazing on her anguished daughters unto Krishna thus she spoke:\n\n"Mark my unconsoled daughters, widowed queens of Kuru\'s house,  \nWailing for their dear departed, like the osprey for her spouse!\n\nHow each cold and fading feature wakes in them a woman\'s love,  \nHow amidst the lifeless warriors still with restless steps they rove,\n\nMothers hug their slaughtered children all unconscious in their sleep,  \nWidows bend upon their husbands and in ceaseless sorrow weep,\n\nMighty Bhishma, hath he fallen, quenched is archer Karna\'s pride,  \nDoth the monarch of Panchala sleep by foeman Drona\'s side?\n\nShining mail and costly jewels, royal bangles strew the plain,  \nGolden garlands rich and burnished deck the chiefs untimely slain,\n\nLances hurled by stalwart fighters, clubs of mighty wrestlers killed  \nSwords and bows of ample measure, quivers still with arrows filled!\n\nMark the unforgotten heroes, jungle prowlers \'mid them stray,  \nOn their brow and mailed bosoms heedless perch the birds of prey,\n\nMark they great unconquered heroes famed on earth from west to east,  \n_Kankas_ perch upon their foreheads, hungry wolves upon them feast!\n\nMark the kings, on softest cushion scarce the needed rest they found,  \nNow they lie in peaceful slumber on the hard and reddened ground,\n\nMark the youths who morn and evening listed to the minstrel\'s song,  \nIn their ear the loathsome jackal doth his doleful wail prolong!\n\nSee the chieftains with their maces and their swords of trusty steel,  \nStill they grasp their tried weapons,--do they still the life-pulse feel?"\n\n## III\n\n## GANDHARI\'S LAMENT FOR DURYODHAN\n\nThus to Krishna, Queen Gandhari strove her woeful thoughts to tell,  \nWhen, alas, her wandering vision on her son Duryodhan fell,\n\nSudden anguish smote her bosom and her senses seemed to stray,  \nLike a tree by tempest shaken senseless on the earth she lay!\n\nOnce again she waked in sorrow, once again she cast her eye  \nWhere her son in blood empurpled slept beneath the open sky,\n\nAnd she clasped her dear Duryodhan, held him close unto her breast,  \nSobs convulsive shook her bosom as the lifeless form she prest,\n\nAnd her tears like rains of summer fell and washed his noble head,  \nDecked with garlands still untarnished, graced with _nishkas_ bright and red!\n\n"\'Mother!\' said my dear Duryodhan when he went unto the war,  \n\'Wish me joy and wish me triumph as I mount the battle-car,\'\n\n\'Son!\' I said to dear Duryodhan, \'Heaven avert a cruel fate,  \n_Yato dharma stato jayah!_ Triumph doth on Virtue wait!\'\n\nBut he set his heart on battle, by his valour wiped his sins,  \nNow he dwells in realms celestial which the faithful warrior wins,\n\nAnd I weep not for Duryodhan, like a prince he fought and fell,  \nBut my sorrow-stricken husband, who can his misfortunes tell!\n\nAy! my son was brave and princely, all resistless in the war,  \nNow he sleeps the sleep of warriors, sunk in gloom his glorious star,\n\nAy! My son \'mid crowned monarchs held the first and foremost way,  \nNow he rests upon the red earth, quenched his bright effulgent ray,\n\nAy! my son the best of heroes, he hath won the warrior\'s sky,  \nKshatras nobly conquer, Krishna, when in war they nobly die!\n\nHark the loathsome cry of jackals, how the wolves their vigils keep,  \nMaidens rich in song and beauty erst were wont to watch his sleep,\n\nHark the foul and blood-beaked vultures flap their wings upon the dead,  \nMaidens waved their feathery _pankhas_ round Duryodhan\'s royal bed,\n\nPeerless bowman! mighty monarch! nations still his hests obeyed,  \nAs a lion slays a tiger, Bhima hath Duryodhan slayed!\n\nThirteen years o\'er Kuru\'s empire proud Duryodhan held his sway,  \nRuled Hastina\'s ancient city where fair Ganga\'s waters stray,\n\nI have seen his regal splendour with these ancient eyes of mine,  \nElephants and battle-chariots, steeds of war and herds of kine,\n\nKuru owns another master and Duryodhan\'s day is fled,  \nAnd I five to be a witness! Krishna, O that I were dead!\n\nMark Duryodhan\'s noble widow, mother proud of Lakshman bold,  \nQueenly in her youth and beauty, like an altar of bright gold,\n\nTorn from husband\'s sweet embraces, from her son\'s entwining arms,  \nDoomed to life-long woe and anguish in her youth and in her charms,\n\nRend my hard and stony bosom crushed beneath this cruel pain,  \nShould Gandhari live to witness noble son and grandson slain?\n\nMark again Duryodhan\'s widow, how she hugs his gory head,  \nHow with gentle hands and tender softly holds him on his bed,\n\nHow from dear departed husband turns she to her dearer son,  \nAnd the tear-drops of the mother choke the widow\'s bitter groan,\n\nLike the fibre of the lotus tender-golden is her frame,  \nO my lotus! O my daughter! Bharat\'s pride and Kuru\'s fame!\n\nIf the truth resides in Vedas, brave Duryodhan dwells above,  \nWherefore linger we in sadness severed from his cherished love,\n\nIf the truth resides in _Sastra_ , dwells in sky my hero son,  \nWherefore linger we in sorrow since their earthly task is done?\n\n## IV\n\n## FUNERAL RITE\n\nVictor of a deathful battle, sad Yudhishthir viewed the plain,  \nFriends and kinsmen, kings and chieftains, countless troops untimely slain,\n\nAnd he spake to wise Sudharman pious priest of Kuru\'s race,  \nUnto Sanjay, unto Dhaumya, to Vidura full of grace,\n\nSpake unto the brave Yuyutsu, Kuru\'s last surviving chief,  \nSpake to faithful Indrasena, and to warriors sunk in grief:\n\n"Pious rites are due to foemen and to friends and kinsmen slain,  \nNone shall lack a fitting funeral, none shall perish on the plain."\n\nWise Vidura and his comrades sped on sacred duty bound,  \nSandalwood and scented aloes, fragrant oil and perfumes found,\n\nSilken robes of costly splendour, fabrics by the artist wove,  \nDry wood from the thorny jungle, perfume from the scented grove,\n\nShattered cars and splintered lances, hewed and ready for the fire,  \nPiled and ranged in perfect order into many a funeral pyre.\n\nKings and princes, noble warriors, were in rank and order laid,  \nAnd with streams of fragrant _ghrita_ were the rich libations made,\n\nBlazed the fire with wondrous radiance by the rich libations fed,  \nSanctifying and consuming mortal remnants of the dead.\n\nBrave Duryodhan and his brothers, Salya of the mighty car,  \nBhurisravas king of nations, Jayadratha famed in war,\n\nAbhimanyu son of Arjun, Lakshman proud Duryodhan\'s son,  \nSomadatta and the Srinjays famed for deeds of valour done,\n\nMatsya\'s monarch proud Virata, Drupad fair Panchala\'s king,  \nAnd his sons, Panchala\'s princes, whose great deeds the minstrels sing,\n\nCultured monarch of Kosala and Gandhara\'s wily lord,  \nKarna, proud and peerless archer, matchless with his flaming sword,\n\nBhagadatta eastern monarch all resistless in his car,  \nGhatotkacha son of Bhima, Alambusha famed in war,\n\nAnd a hundred other monarchs all received the pious rite,  \nTill the radiance of the fire-light chased the shadows of the night!\n\n_\n\nPitri-medha_ ; due to fathers was performed with pious care,  \nHymns and wails and lamentations mingled in the midnight air,\n\nSacred songs of _rik_ and _saman_ rose with women\'s piercing wail,  \nAnd the creatures of the wide earth heard the sound subdued and pale,\n\nSmokeless and with radiant lustre shone each red and lighted pyre,  \nLike the planets of the bright sky throbbing with celestial fire!\n\nMen in nations, countless, nameless, from each court and camp afar,  \nFrom the east and west collected, fell in Kuru-Kshetra\'s war,\n\nThousand fires for them were lighted, they received the pious rite,  \nSuch was good Yudhishthir\'s mandate, such was wise Vidura\'s might,\n\nAll the dead were burned to ashes and the sacred rite was o\'er,  \nDhrita-rashtra and Yudhishthir slowly walked to Ganga\'s shore!\n\n## V\n\n## OBLATION TO KARNA\n\nSacred Ganga, ample-bosomed, sweeps along in regal pride,  \nRolling down her limpid waters through high banks on either side,\n\nChildless dames and weeping widows thither in their anguish came,  \nDue and holy rites to render to departed chiefs of fame,\n\nCasting forth their jewelled girdles, gems and scarfs belaced with gold,  \nGave oblations of the water unto warriors true and bold,\n\nUnto fathers, unto husbands, unto sons in battle slayed,  \nOfferings of the sacred water sorrowing wives and mothers made.\n\nAnd so great the host of mourners wending to perform the rite,  \nThat their footsteps made a pathway in the sad and sacred site,\n\nAnd the shelving banks of Ganga, peopled by the sorrowing train,  \nWide-expanding, vast and sealike, formed a scene of woe and pain!\n\nBut a wave of keener sorrow swept o\'er Pritha\'s heaving breast,  \nAs unto her weeping children thus her secret she expressed:\n\n_\n\n"He, my sons, the peerless bowman, mighty in his battle-car,  \nWho by will of fate untimely was by Arjun slain in war,\n\nHe whom as the son of Radha, chariot-driver ye have thought,  \nBut who shone with SURYA\'S lustre as his countless foes he fought,\n\nHe who faced your stoutest warriors and in battle never failed,  \nBravely led the Kuru forces and in danger never quailed,\n\nHe who knew no peer in prowess, owned in war no haughtier name,  \nYielded life but not his honour and by death hath conquered fame,\n\nHe in truth who never faltered, never left his vow undone,  \nOffer unto him oblation, Karna was my eldest son!\n\nKarna was your honoured elder and the Sun inspired his birth,  \nKarna in his rings and armour Sun-like trod the spacious earth!"\n\n_\n\nPritha spake; the Pandav brothers groaned in penitence and pain,  \nAnd they wept in woe and anguish for the brother they had slain.\n\nHissing forth his sigh of anguish like a crushed and wounded snake,  \nSad Yudhishthir to his mother thus his inward feelings spake:\n\nDidst thou, mother, bear the hero fathomless like ocean dread,  \nWhose unfailing glistening arrows like its countless billows sped,\n\nDidst thou bear that peerless archer all-resistless in his car,  \nSweeping with the roar of ocean through the shattered ranks of war?\n\nDidst thou hide the mighty warrior, mortal man of heavenly birth,  \nCrushing \'neath his arm of valour all his foemen on the earth,\n\nDidst thou hide the birth and lineage of that chief of deathful ire,  \nAs a man in folds of garments seeks to hide the flaming fire?\n\nArjun wielder of Gandiva was for us no truer stay  \nThan was Karna for the Kurus in the battle\'s dread array,\n\nMonarchs matched not Karna\'s glory nor his deeds of valour done,  \nMidst the mighty car-borne warriors mightiest warrior Karna shone!\n\nWoe to us! our eldest brother we have in the battle slain,  \nAnd our nearest dearest elder fell upon the gory plain,\n\nNot the death of Abhimanyu from the fair Subhadra torn,  \nNot the slaughter of the princes by the proud Draupadi borne,\n\nNot the fall of friends and kinsmen and Panchala\'s mighty host,  \nLike thy death afflicts my bosom, noble Karna loved and lost!\n\nMonarch\'s empire, victor\'s glory, all the treasures earth can yield,  \nRighteous bliss and heavenly gladness, harvest of the heavenly field,\n\nAll that wish can shape and utter, all that nourish hope and pride,  \nAll were ours, O noble Karna, hadst thou rested by our side,\n\nAnd this carnage of the Kurus these sad eyes had never seen,  \nPeace had graced our blessed empire, happy would the earth have been!"\n\nLong bewailed the sad Yudhishthir for his elder loved and dead,  \nAnd oblation of the water to the noble Karna made,\n\nAnd the royal dames of Kuru viewed the sight with freshening pain,  \nWept to see the good Yudhishthir offering to his brother slain,\n\nAnd the widowed queen of Karna with the women of his house  \nGave oblations to her hero, wept her loved and slaughtered spouse!\n\nDone the rites to the, departed, done oblations to the dead,  \nSlowly then the sad survivors on the river\'s margin spread,\n\nFar along the shore and sandbank of the sacred sealike stream  \nMaid and matron lave their bodies \'neath the morning\'s holy beam,\n\nAnd ablutions done, the Kurus slow and sad and cheerless part,  \nWend their way to far Hastina with a void and vacant heart.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XII: Sacrifice of the Horse](maha12.htm)\n\n'
