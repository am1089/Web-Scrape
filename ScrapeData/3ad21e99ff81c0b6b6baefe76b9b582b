On the full-moon day of Praush _th_ apada the sacrifice to Indra.\n\n2 2. Having cooked milk-rice for Indra and cakes, and having put cakes round\n(the fire), he sacrifices the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions and \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations to\nIndra, to Indra _n_ i, to A _g_ a Ekapad, to Ahi Budhnya, and to the Prosh\n_th_ apadas.\n\n3 3. After he has eaten (his portion of the sacrificial food), he offers a\nBali to the Maruts. For the _S_ ruti says, \'The Maruts eat what is not-\nsacrificed.\'\n\n4 4. (This Bali he offers) in A _s_ vattha leaves, because it is said, \'The\nMaruts stood in the A _s_ vattha tree.\'\n\np. 332\n\n5 5. (He offers it) with (the texts), \'Brilliantly resplendent\' (Var.

After these \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations follows the\nchief oblation of the whole sacrifice, the oblation of milk-rice to Indra. In\none of Professor Stenzler\'s MSS. there is a special Sutra inserted after Sutra\n2, \'Of the cooked food he makes an oblation with (the formula), "To Indra\nsvaha."\' I do not, however, think it right to receive this Sutra into the\ntext, as the other MSS. do not support it, and the commentators did not find\nit in the text which they read.\n\n[331:3](sbe29188.htm#fr_850) Professor Stenzler\'s translation, \'Die Maruts\nessen kein Opfer,\' seems to me not quite exact. I should prefer to say, \'Die\nMaruts essen Nicht-Opfer.\' This passage, taken from _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a\nIV, 5, 2, 16, is quoted as supporting the rule that a Bali offering should be\nmade to the Maruts; for in the technical language the term ahuta is applied to\nBali offerings ( _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 10, 7, huto\xe0\xa4\xbdgnihotrahomena, ahuto\nbalikarma _n_ a).\n\n[331:4](sbe29188.htm#fr_851) When Indra called them to his help against V _ri_\ntra. _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a IV, 3, 3, 6.\n\n[332:5](sbe29188.htm#fr_852) This Sutra is identical with the last words of\nKaty. XVIII, 4, 23.\n\n[332:6](sbe29188.htm#fr_853) This is the first part of Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XVII,\n86.\n\n[332:8](sbe29188.htm#fr_854) _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a IX, 3, I, 26. There it\nis said that _s_ ukra _g_ yoti _s_ (\'brilliantly resplendent\') &c. (the words\nused in Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XVII, 80) are names of the Maruts.\n\n[332:9](sbe29188.htm#fr_855) This Sutra is identical with Katy. XVIII, 4, 25.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 16](sbe29189.htm)\n\n'
