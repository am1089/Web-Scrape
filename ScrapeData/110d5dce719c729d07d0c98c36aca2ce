ADULTERY.\n\n1. 1 The two kinds of injury (abuse and assault) and the three kinds of violence have been declared. Learn the threefold (offence of) adultery, which is productive of sin.\n\n2\\. The two first kinds of it are connected with violence and deception\nrespectively, the third kind springs from sensual desire; the last is again of\nthree sorts, being of the first, second, or highest degree.\n\n3\\. When a man has intercourse with a woman in secret against her will, when\nshe is asleep, or disordered in her intellect, or does not notice his\napproach, it is (termed) forcible enjoyment of a woman.\n\n4\\. When he conducts her into his house under false pretences, and after\ngiving her intoxicating drugs, has intercourse with her, it is considered\nfraudulent enjoyment of a woman.\n\n5\\. When a man exchanges looks with a woman or sends her messages, and has\nintercourse with her impelled by sensuality, it has to be considered as\n(adulterous intercourse) springing from sensual desire.\n\n6. 6 Winking (at a woman), smiling (at her), sending her messengers, and touching her ornaments or clothes, is termed an adulterous act of the first (or lowest) degree.\n\n7\\. Sending perfumes, garlands, fruit, spirituous liquor, food, or clothes,\nand conversing with her in\n\np. 366\n\nsecret, is considered an adulterous act of the second degree.\n\n8\\. Sitting on the same bed, dallying, and kissing or embracing each other, is\ndefined as an adulterous act of the highest degree by persons acquainted with\nlaw.\n\n9. 9 For these three gradations of adultery, the first, middling, and highest fines shall be inflicted respectively; the fine shall be even higher than that, in the case of a very rich man.\n\n10. 10 (The king) shall confiscate the whole wealth of him who violates an unwilling woman, and having caused his penis and scrotum to be cut off, shall cause him to be paraded on an ass.\n\n11. 11 When a man enjoys a woman by fraud, his punishment shall be confiscation of his entire wealth, and he shall afterwards be branded with the mark of a female part and banished from the town.\n\n12\\. The highest fine (shall be inflicted for connexion) with a woman of equal\ncaste; half of that (for connexion) with a woman of inferior caste; but a man\nwho has connexion with a woman of higher caste than his own, shall be put to\ndeath.\n\n13. 13 When a woman has been enjoyed against her\n\np. 367\n\nwill, she shall be kept in the house well guarded, smeared (with ashes), lying\non a low couch, and receiving a bare maintenance only.\n\n14\\. To atone for her sin, she shall be caused to perform the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_\nra or Paraka penance, in case she had intercourse with her equal in caste; but\nif she has been enjoyed by a man of inferior caste, she shall be abandoned and\nput to death.\n\n15. 15 When a woman comes to a man's house and excites his concupiscence by touching him or the like acts, she shall be punished; half of her punishment shall be inflicted on the man.\n\n16. 16 Her nose, lips, and ears having been cut off, she shall be paraded in the streets and plunged into water; or she shall be torn to pieces by dogs in a public place frequented by many persons.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[365:1](sbe3381.htm#fr_1200) XXIII, 1-5.
