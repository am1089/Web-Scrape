Now (follows) the Vai _s_ vadeva (sacrifice).\n\n2 2. The rite of the sacrifice has been explained.\n\n3\\. Let him pour oblations of prepared Vai _s_ vadeva food in the evening and\nin the morning into the (sacred) domestic fire.\n\n4\\. \'To Agni svaha! To Soma svaha! To Indra and Agni svaha! To Vish _n_ u\nsvaha! To Bharadva _g_ a Dhanvantari svaha! To the Vi _s_ ve devas svaha! To\nPra _g_ apati svaha! To Aditi svaha! To Anumati svaha! To Agni Svish _t_ ak\n_ri_ t\n\np. 85\n\nsvaha!\'\xc2\x97having thus offered the oblations belonging to those deities,\n\n5\\. He then shall offer Balis (i.e. portions of food) in the centre of the\nfloor to the same deities; (then another Bali with the words,) \'Adoration to\nBrahman and to the Brahma _n_ as!\' and (with the verse), \'Vastoshpati, accept\nus\' (Rig-veda VII, 54, 1) in the centre of the floor to Vastoshpati.\n\n6 6-7. He then distributes Balis, from the left to the right, through the\ndifferent quarters (of the horizon, to the presiding deities) in due order\n(with the words),\n\n7\\. \'Adoration to Indra and to those belonging to Indra! Adoration to Yama and\nto those belonging to Yama! Adoration to Varu _n_ a and to those belonging to\nVaru _n_ a! Adoration to Soma and to those belonging to Soma! Adoration to B\n_ri_ haspati and to those belonging to B _ri_ haspati!\'\n\n8 8. Then (turned) towards the disk of the sun, \'Adoration to Aditi and to the\n\xc3\x82dityas! Adoration\n\n5\\. \'He shall offer a Bali to those deities, i.e. to those ten deities to whom\nhe has sacrificed, to Agni, &c. (see Sutra 4), addressing them with the word,\n"Adoration (to such and such a deity")\xc2\x97because in the other cases the word\n"adoration" (nama _h_ ) has been prescribed for the Bali.\' Naraya _n_ a.\n\np. 86\n\nto the Nakshatras, to seasons, to months, to half-months, to days and nights,\nto years!\'\n\n9\\. \'To Pushan, the path-maker; to Dhatar, to Vidhatar, and to the\nMaruts\'\xc2\x97(thus) on the thresholds.\n\n10\\. To Vish _n_ u on the grindstone.\n\n11\\. \'To the tree\'\xc2\x97(thus) in the mortar.\n\n12\\. \'To the herbs\'\xc2\x97(thus) where the herbs are kept.\n\n13\\. \'To Par _g_ anya, to the waters\'\xc2\x97(thus) near the water-pot.\n\n14\\. \'Adoration to _S_ ri\'\xc2\x97(thus) in the bed at the head, \'to Bhadrakali at\nthe foot.\n\n15\\. In the privy, \'Adoration to Sarvannabhuti!\'\n\n16\\. Then (he throws a Bali) into the air, in the evening with the words, \'To\nthe night-walkers,\' in the morning with the words, \'To the day-walkers,\' and\nwith the Verse,\' Which gods\' (Rig-veda I, 139, 11).\n\n17\\. To the unknown deities to the north, and to Dhanapati (i.e. the Lord of\ntreasures).\n\nI8. With the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder he pours out\nthe remnant to the south with the verse, \'They whom the fire has burnt\' (Rig-\nveda X, 15, 14).\n\n19\\. When he has made his offerings to gods, fathers (i.e. Manes), and men,\nlet him give food to a _S_ rotriya (i.e. to a learned Brahma _n_ a).\n\n20\\. Or let him give alms (of food) to a student.\n\n21 21. Let him immediately afterwards offer food to a female under his\nprotection, to a pregnant woman, to boys, and to old people.\n\np. 87\n\n22 22-23. Let him throw (some food) on the ground for the dogs, for the dog-\nbutchers, and for the birds.\n\n23 23. Let him eat nothing without having cut off (and offered as a Bali) a\nportion thereof.\n\n24\\. (Let him) not (eat) alone,\n\n25\\. Nor before (the others).\n\n26\\. With regard thereto it has been said also in the _Ri_ _k_ ,\' In vain the\nfool gains food\' (Rig-veda X, 117, 6).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[84:1](sbe29044.htm#fr_187) 14, 1. The rules regarding the Vai _s_ vadeva\nsacrifice stand here, as I have already pointed out in the German edition, p.\n142, in a very strange position amid the matter that concerns the student, and\nbefore the description of the ceremony that concludes studentship (the\nSamavartana; III, 1). On the first word of the chapter, atha, Naraya _n_ a\nobserves that thereby the householder is marked as the subject of the\nfollowing rules. It seems rather forced to explain the position of this\nchapter, as Naraya _n_ a does, by pointing out that in some cases, for\ninstance when the teacher is away on a journey, a student also can eventually\nbe called upon to perform the Vai _s_ vadeva sacrifice (comp. below, chap. 17,\n3).\n\n[84:2](sbe29044.htm#fr_188) This Sutra shows, according to Naraya _n_ a, that\nthe Vai _s_ vadeva offering does not follow the ordinary type of sacrifice\n(the Prati _s_ rute homakalpa, as it is termed above, I, 9, 19), but the form\ndescribed in the Agnikaryaprakara _n_ a, above, chap. 10, 3 seq.\n\n[85:6-7](sbe29044.htm#fr_189) 6, 7. The distribution of Balis begins in the\neast, which is the part of the horizon sacred to Indra; it then proceeds to\nthe south, the west, the north, which are sacred respectively to Yama, Varu\n_n_ a, and Soma. Finally the Bali belonging to B _ri_ haspati and the\nBarhaspatyas is offered, according to Naraya _n_ a, to the north-east.\n\n[85:8](sbe29044.htm#fr_190) The commentators (see p. 142 of the German\nedition) differ as to whether adityama _n_ _d_ ala means the disk of the sun\ntowards which this Bali should be offered, or a place or an apartment of\ncircular form (adityama _n_ _d_ alarupe ma _n_ _d_ alagare, as in my opinion\nwe ought to correct the reading in Naraya _n_ a\'s note).\n\n[86:21](sbe29044.htm#fr_191) Comp. Bohtlingk-Roth s. v. suvasini, and\nProfessor Buhler\'s note on Gautama V, 25.\n\n[87:22-23](sbe29044.htm#fr_192) 22, 23. Probably these Sutras should be\ndivided after iti.\n\n[87:23](sbe29044.htm#fr_193) \'Purva _m_ means, he should not eat before his\nrelations (bandhubhya _h_ purva _m_ prathamata _h_ ).\' Naraya _n_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 15](sbe29045.htm)\n\n'
