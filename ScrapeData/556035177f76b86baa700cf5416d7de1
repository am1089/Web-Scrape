If you say that as the organs (are ruled by the soul so the pradhana is\nruled by the Lord), we deny that on account of the enjoyment, &c.\n\nWell, the opponent might reply, let us suppose that the Lord rules the\npradhana in the same way as the soul rules the organ of sight and the other\norgans which are devoid of colour, and so on, and hence not objects of\nperception.\n\nThis analogy also, we reply, proves nothing. For we infer that the organs are\nruled by the soul, from the observed fact that the soul feels pleasure, pain,\nand the like (which affect the soul through the organs). But we do not observe\nthat the Lord experiences pleasure, pain, &c. caused\n\np. 438\n\nby the pradhana. If the analogy between the pradhana and the bodily organs\nwere a complete one, it would follow that the Lord is affected by pleasure and\npain no less than the transmigrating souls are.\n\nOr else the two preceding Sutras may be explained in a different way. Ordinary\nexperience teaches us that kings, who are the rulers of countries, are never\nwithout some material abode, i.e. a body; hence, if we wish to infer the\nexistence of a general Lord from the analogy of earthly rulers, we must\nascribe to him also some kind of body to serve as the substratum of his\norgans. But such a body cannot be ascribed to the Lord, since all bodies exist\nonly subsequently to the creation, not previously to it. The Lord, therefore,\nis not able to act because devoid of a material substratum; for experience\nteaches us that action requires a material substrate.--Let us then arbitrarily\nassume that the Lord possesses some kind of body serving as a substratum for\nhis organs (even previously to creation).--This assumption also will not do;\nfor if the Lord has a body he is subject to the sensations of ordinary\ntransmigratory souls, and thus no longer is the Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 41](sbe34217.htm)\n\n'
