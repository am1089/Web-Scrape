That which is inferred (by the Sa _n_ khyas, viz. the pradhana) cannot be\nthe cause (of the world), on account of the orderly arrangement (of the world)\nbeing impossible (on that hypothesis).\n\nAlthough it is the object of this system to define the true meaning of the\nVedanta-texts and not, like the science of Logic, to establish or refute some\ntenet by mere ratiocination, still it is incumbent on thorough students of the\nVedanta to refute the Sa _n_ khya and other systems which are obstacles in the\nway of perfect knowledge. For this purpose a new chapter is begun. (Nor must\nit be said that the refutation of the other systems ought to have preceded the\nestablishment of the Vedanta position; for) as the determination of the sense\nof the Vedanta-passages directly subserves perfect knowledge, we have at\nfirst, by means of such a determination, established our own position, since\nthis is a task more important than the refutation of the views entertained by\nothers.\n\nHere an opponent might come forward and say that we are indeed entitled to\nestablish our own position, so as to define perfect knowledge which is the\nmeans of release to those desirous of it, but that no use is apparent of a\nrefutation of other opinions, a proceeding productive of nothing but hate and\nanger.--There is a use, we reply. For there is some danger of men of inferior\nintelligence looking upon the Sa _n_ khya and similar systems as requisite for\nperfect knowledge, because those systems have a weighty appearance, have been\nadopted by authoritative persons, and profess to lead to perfect knowledge.\nSuch people might therefore think that those systems with their abstruse\narguments\n\np. 364\n\nwere propounded by omniscient sages, and might on that account have faith in\nthem. For this reason we must endeavour to demonstrate their intrinsic\nworthlessness.\n\nBut, it might be said, the Sa _n_ khya and similar systems have already been\nimpugned in several Sutras of the first adhyaya (I, 1, 5, 18; I, 4, 28); why,\nthen, controvert them again?--The task--we reply--which we are now about to\nundertake differs from what we have already accomplished. As the Sa _n_ khyas\nand other philosophers also quote, in order to establish their own positions,\nthe Vedanta-passages and interpret them in such a manner as to make them agree\nwith their own systems, we have hitherto endeavoured to show that their\ninterpretations are altogether fallacious. Now, however, we are going to\nrefute their arguments in an independent manner, without any reference to the\nVedanta-texts.\n\nThe Sa _n_ khyas, to make a beginning with them, argue as follows.--Just as\njars, dishes, and other products which possess the common quality of\nconsisting of clay are seen to have for their cause clay in general; so we\nmust suppose that all the outward and inward (i.e. inanimate and animate)\neffects which are endowed with the characteristics of pleasure, pain, and\ndulness  1 have for their causes pleasure, pain, and dulness in general.\nPleasure, pain, and dulness in their generality together constitute the\nthreefold pradhana. This pradhana which is non-intelligent evolves itself\nspontaneously into multiform modifications  2, in order thus to effect the\npurposes (i.e. enjoyment, release, and so on) of the intelligent soul.--The\nexistence of the pradhana is to be inferred from other circumstances also,\nsuch as the limitation of all effects and the like  3.\n\nAgainst this doctrine we argue as follows.--If you Sankhyas base your theory\non parallel instances merely, we point\n\np. 365\n\nout that a non-intelligent thing which, without being guided by an intelligent\nbeing, spontaneously produces effects capable of subserving the purposes of\nsome particular person is nowhere observed in the world. We rather observe\nthat houses, palaces, couches, pleasure-grounds, and the like--things which\naccording to circumstances are conducive to the obtainment of pleasure or the\navoidance of pain--are made by workmen endowed with intelligence. Now look at\nthis entire world which appears, on the one hand, as external (i. e.\ninanimate) in the form of earth and the other elements enabling (the souls) to\nenjoy the fruits of their various actions, and, on the other hand, as animate,\nin the form of bodies which belong to the different classes of beings, possess\na definite arrangement of organs, and are therefore capable of constituting\nthe abodes of fruition; look, we say, at this world, of which the most\ningenious workmen cannot even form a conception in their minds, and then say\nif a non-intelligent principle like the pradhana is able to fashion it! Other\nnon-intelligent things such as stones and clods of earth are certainly not\nseen to possess analogous powers. We rather must assume that just as clay and\nsimilar substances are seen to fashion themselves into various forms, if\nworked upon by potters and the like, so the pradhana also (when modifying\nitself into its effects) is ruled by some intelligent principle. When\nendeavouring to determine the nature of the primal cause (of the world), there\nis no need for us to take our stand on those attributes only which form part\nof the nature of material causes such as clay, &c., and not on those also\nwhich belong to extraneous agents such as potters, &c.  1 Nor (if remembering\nthis latter point) do we enter into conflict with any means of right\nknowledge; we, on the contrary, are in direct agreement with Scripture which\nteaches that an intelligent\n\np. 366\n\ncause exists.--For the reason detailed in the above, i.e. on account of the\nimpossibility of the 'orderly arrangement' (of the world), a non-intelligent\ncause of the world is not to be inferred.--The word 'and' (in the Sutra) adds\nother reasons on account of which the pradhana cannot be inferred, viz. 'on\naccount of the non-possibility of endowment,' &c. For it cannot be maintained\n1 that all outward and inward effects are 'endowed' with the nature of\npleasure, pain, and dulness, because pleasure, &c. are known as inward\n(mental) states, while sound, &c. (i. e. the sense-objects) are known as being\nof a different nature (i. e. as outward things), and moreover as being the\noperative causes of pleasure, &c. 2 And, further, although the sense-object\nsuch as sound and so on is one, yet we observe that owing to the difference of\nthe mental impressions (produced by it) differences exist in the effects it\nproduces, one person being affected by it pleasantly, another painfully, and\nso on 3.--(Turning to the next Sa _n_ khya argument which infers the existence\nof the pradhana from the limitation of all effects), we remark that he who\nconcludes that all inward and outward effects depend on a conjunction of\nseveral things, because they are limited (a conclusion based on the\nobservation that some limited effects such as roof and sprout, &c. depend on\nthe conjunction of several things), is driven to the conclusion that the three\nconstituents of the pradhana, viz. Goodness, Passion, and Darkness, likewise\ndepend on the conjunction of several\n\np. 367\n\nantecedents 1; for they also are limited 2.--Further 3, it is impossible to\nuse the relation of cause and effect as a reason for assuming that all effects\nwhatever have a non-intelligent principle for their antecedent; for we have\nshown already that that relation exists in the case of couches and chairs\nalso, over whose production intelligence presides.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[364:1](sbe34177.htm#fr_318) The characteristics of Goodness, Passion, and\nDarkness, the three constituent elements (gu _n_ a) of the pradhana.
