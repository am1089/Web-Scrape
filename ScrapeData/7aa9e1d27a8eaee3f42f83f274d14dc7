The _K_ arakas slaughter (a he-goat) for Pra _g_ apati, saying,\n\'Pra _g_ apati, having built up the fire-altar (agni), became Agni. When he\nslaughters that one, then indeed he reaches the end of Agni (the fire-altar).\'\n\n6:2:2:22\\. It is a dark grey one; for the grey has two kinds of hair, the\nwhite and the black; and two make a productive pair: that is its Pra _g_\napati-characteristic. It is a hornless one, for Pra _g_ apati is hornless.\n\np. 172\n\n6:2:2:33\\. For this (animal sacrifice) there are twenty-one kindling-verses\n1;--twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun,--that is\nthe twenty-onefold Pra _g_ apati; and Pra _g_ apati is Agni: as great as Agni\nis, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.\n\n6:2:2:44\\. And, again, why there are twenty-one;--man (purusha) doubtless is\ntwenty-onefold, ten fingers of the hand, ten toes, and the body (make) the\ntwenty-onefold man Pra _g_ apati; and Pra _g_ apati is Agni: as great as Agni\nis, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.\n\n6:2:2:55\\. He recites both gayatri and trish _t_ ubh verses: their\nsignificance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the verses has\nbeen told. The libation of ghee 2 he makes with the verse containing (the\nname) Hira _n_ yagarbha 3; for Hira _n_ yagarbha.\n\np. 173\n\nis Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is Agni. There are twelve \xc3\x82pri-verses:\ntheir significance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the\nverses has been told. The animal cake belongs to Pra _g_ apati, for the\nrelation of the victim is also that of the animal cake 1. It is one on twelve\npotsherds: twelve months are a year, and the year is Pra _g_ apati. The\noffering and invitatory formulas contain the word \'Ka,\' for Pra _g_ apati is\nKa 2.\n\n6:2:2:66\\. He then slaughters for Vayu Niyutvat (the wind, driving a team of\nhorses) that white, bearded (he-goat). When Pra _g_ apati had produced living\nbeings, he looked about him, and from exceeding delight his seed fell: it\nbecame that white, hornless, bearded he-goat (a _g_ a, \'unborn\'); for seed is\nlife-sap, and as far as there is life-sap, so far extends the self. And when\nhe slaughters that one, then indeed he reaches the end of Agni (the fire-\naltar). It is a white one, because seed is white. It is hornless, because seed\nis hornless. It belongs to Vayu, because Vayu (the wind) is the out-breathing;\nand to Niyutvat, because the teams (niyut 3) are the in-breathing: the out-\nbreathing and in-breathing he thus lays into him.\n\np. 174\n\n6:2:2:77\\. And, again, why he slaughters that white, hornless (he-goat);--when\nthe gods restored the relaxed Pra _g_ apati, they, by means of this victim,\nput into him that out-breathing which had gone out of him; and in like mariner\nthis one now puts it into him. It belongs to Vayu, because Vayu is the out-\nbreathing; and to Niyutvat, because the teams are the in-breathing: he thus\nputs the out-breathing and in-breathing into him. It is white, because Vayu\n(the wind) is white; and it is hornless, because Vayu is hornless.\n\n6:2:2:88\\. For this (animal sacrifice) there are seventeen kindling-verses 1;\nfor the year is seventeenfold--there are twelve months and five seasons--Pra\n_g_ apati is the year, and Pra _g_ apati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as\ngreat as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.\n\n6:2:2:99\\. And, again, why there are seventeen,--man is seventeenfold,--there\nare ten vital airs, four limbs, the body the fifteenth, the neck-joints the\nsixteenth, and the head the seventeenth,--Pra _g_ apati is the Person (or man,\npurusha), and Pra _g_ apati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, by so much he thus kindles him.\n\n6:2:2:1010\\. He recites both gayatri and trish _t_ ubh verses: their\nsignificance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the verses has\nbeen told. There are twelve \xc3\x82pri-verses: their significance has been told; and\n(what applies to) the order of the verses has been told. The animal cake\nbelongs to Pra _g_ apati: \'Therein then that wish was obtained,\'\n\np. 175\n\n[paragraph continues] Mahitthi once said,--\'which the _K_ arakas say is in the\nvictim to Pra _g_ apati.\'\n\n6:2:2:1111\\. And as to why the victim belongs to Vayu, and the animal cake to\nPra _g_ apati;--one half of Pra _g_ apati doubtless is Vayu, and one half is\nPra _g_ apati: thus, were they both to belong to Vayu, or both to Pra _g_\napati, then only one half of him (Pra _g_ apati) would be made up, and one\nhalf would not (be made up). But in that the victim belongs to Vayu, and the\nanimal cake to Pra _g_ apati, thereby he puts together (restores) him, Pra _g_\napati, wholly and entirely.\n\n6:2:2:1212\\. And, again, why the victim belongs to Vayu, and the animal cake\nto Pra _g_ apati;--when the gods restored the relaxed Pra _g_ apati, they, by\nmeans of this victim, put into him that out-breathing which had gone out of\nhim; and by means of this cake they restored that body (trunk) of his. And as\nto why it belongs to Pra _g_ apati, it is because the body (self) is Pra _g_\napati; and (why it is) one on twelve potsherds,--twelve months are a year, and\nPra _g_ apati is the year. One of the offering prayers and one of the\ninvitatory prayers 1 contain (the word) \'ka,\' for Pra _g_ apati is Ka.\n\np. 176\n\n6:2:2:1313\\. Now when in the first place he offers the omentum, he thereby\nputs into him (Pra _g_ apati) that vital air which is here in front. And when\nthey proceed with that (cake) in the middle, it is because this trunk is in\nthe middle. And when they proceed thereafter with the (meat) oblation, he\nthereby puts into him that vital air which is behind. The (remaining) offering\nand invitatory prayers should contain the word \'bright,\' with the view of the\nobtainment of bright forms; and the word \'niyut\' (team), for the obtainment of\nthat form which has a team 1.\n\np. 177\n\n6:2:2:1414\\. As to this they say, \'It is rather the two (prayers) of the\nOmentum that should contain (the word) "bright," for so far as the two\n(prayers) of the omentum containing (the word) "bright" extend, extends what\nis bright in the animal (sacrifice); and the two (prayers) of the (meat)\noblation should contain (the word) "team," for the obtainment of that form of\nhim (Pra _g_ apati) which has a team.\'\n\n6:2:2:1515\\. And, again, why he slaughters this animal;--in this animal\ndoubtless the form of all (the five kinds of) animals is (contained): inasmuch\nas it is hornless and bearded, that is the form of man, for man is hornless\nand bearded; inasmuch as it is hornless and furnished with a mane, that is the\nform of the horse, for the horse is hornless and furnished with a mane;\ninasmuch as it is eight-hoofed, that is the bull\'s form, for the bull is\neight-hoofed; inasmuch as its hoofs are like those of the sheep, that is the\nform of the\n\np. 178\n\nsheep; and inasmuch as it is a he-goat, that is that of the goat. Thus when he\nslaughters this one, thereby indeed all those (five) animals are slaughtered\nfor him. Whichever of these may suit him--either those five animals, or that\n(he-goat) for Pra _g_ apati, or that one for (Vayu) Niyutvat 1\\--\n\n6:2:2:1616\\. Let him slaughter it at full moon. \'Let him slaughter at new\nmoon,\' so say some, \'for Pra _g_ apati is yonder moon: during that night (of\nnew moon) he dwells here (on earth) 2, and it would be just as if he\nslaughtered him while staying near.\'\n\n6:2:2:1717\\. But, indeed, this (takes place) at full moon, for the victim is\nyonder moon, and him the gods slaughter at full moon 3: \'I will slaughter him\nat the time when the gods slaughter him,\' thus he thinks, and therefore (he\ndoes so) at full moon. And, again, why at full moon;--the full moon no\n\np. 179\n\ndoubt was the first to shine forth, hence also (the sacrifice takes place) at\nfull moon.\n\n6:2:2:1818\\. And furthermore, at the Phalguna (full moon), for that full moon\nof Phalguna, that is, the second (Phalguna) 1, is the first night of the year;\nand that first (Phalguna) is the last (night of the year): he thus begins the\nyear at the very mouth (beginning).\n\n6:2:2:1919\\. Now, as soon as he has performed the full-moon offering, let him\nslaughter the victim. For Indra, having driven away V _ri_ tra, evil, by means\nof the full-moon offering, thus freed from evil entered upon this sacrificial\nperformance; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having driven away V _ri_ tra,\nevil, by means of the full-moon offering, thus freed from evil now enters on\nthis (sacred) performance.\n\n6:2:2:2020\\. This is (performed) in a low voice, for by means of these victims\nPra _g_ apati sought to obtain this (sacred) work 2; but that (work) was then,\nas it were, uncertain, indistinct: hence in a low voice.\n\n6:2:2:2121\\. And, again, why in a low voice;--this performance assuredly\nbelongs to Pra _g_ apati, for it is Pra _g_ apati he enters upon by this\nperformance; and Pra _g_ apati is undefined.\n\n6:2:2:2222\\. And, again, why in a low voice;--there is seed here in the\nsacrifice, and seed is cast silently--the\n\np. 180\n\nomentum, the animal cake, and the chief oblation, for of that much consists\nthe animal sacrifice.\n\n6:2:2:2323\\. On the eighth day (after full moon) he collects (the materials\nfor) the fire-pan; for sacred to Pra _g_ apati is that day, the eighth (after\nfull moon), and sacred to Pra _g_ apati is this (sacred) piece of work, the\nfire-pan: on a day sacred to Pra _g_ apati he thus performs the work sacred to\nPra _g_ apati.\n\n6:2:2:2424\\. And as to why (it is performed) on the eighth day;--that eighth\nday no doubt is a joint of the year, and that fire-pan is a joint of Agni (the\nfire-altar): he thus makes joint upon joint.\n\n6:2:2:2525\\. And, again, why on the eighth day;--eightfold doubtless is the\npan 1\\--the bottom part, the two side-parts, the horizontal belt (or rim),\nthat makes four; and four upright (bands), that makes eight: he thus makes the\neightfold on the eightfold (or eighth).\n\n6:2:2:2626\\. He performs the initiation on the day of new moon; for from out\nof the new moon the sacrifice is spread: \'Whence the sacrifice is spread,\nthence will I generate the sacrifice,\' so he thinks.\n\n6:2:2:2727\\. And, again, why he (does so) at new moon;--when he performs the\ninitiation, he verily pours out his \'own self, as seed, into the fire-pan, the\nwomb; and when he becomes initiated, he makes for it (his self) that world (or\nplace) beforehand 2, and he is\n\np. 181\n\nborn into the world made by him: hence they say, Man is born into the world\nmade (by him) 1.\'\n\n6:2:2:2828\\. Now, were he to be initiated during less than a year, he would\nbuild up bricks without space (for them) 2: the bricks would exceed the\nspaces. And if, after making more spaces 3, he were not to fill up bricks in\naccordance therewith, the spaces would exceed the bricks. And when, after\ninitiating himself at new moon, he buys (Soma) at new moon 4, he piles up as\nmany bricks as he (during the interval) makes space for; and when his (Agni\'s\nsecond) wing is covered (with loose soil), the whole Agni is built up.\n\n6:2:2:2929\\. As to this they say, \'If at the time of the buying (of Soma) the\ndays and nights (of the initiation-period) amount to just as many as there are\nbricks of that fire-altar, why then are not those\n\np. 182\n\nspaces of his filled up (which are prepared) during the days there are after\nthe buying (of Soma) 1? Well, when he buys (Soma) at new moon, after becoming\ninitiated at new moon (a year previously), then he piles up just as many\nbricks as (during that interval) he makes space for; and what days there then\nare after the buying (of Soma), during that interval the Adhvaryu builds up\nthe fire-altar. But when should he build up, if there were not that interval?\nAs many as there are days and nights in the year, so many are the bricks of\nthat fire-altar. Thereto (comes) a thirteenth month, for there is that\nthirteenth month;--thus during the days there are after the buying (of Soma),\nthose spaces of it (the altar) are filled up afterwards with those bricks of\nthe thirteenth month: thus the spaces and the bricks become equal.\n\n6:2:2:3030\\. Thus, then, what first full moon there is (in the year) on that\nhe slaughters the victim; and what first eighth-day there is, on that he\nprepares the fire-pan; and what first new moon there is, on that he becomes\ninitiated: thus whatever first days there are in the year, of those he thereby\ntakes possession for him (Agni, the altar), those he thereby gains. Now then\nas to the total amount (of the fire-altar) 2.\n\np. 183\n\n6:2:2:3131\\. Here now they say, \'How does that sacrificial performance of his\n(the animal sacrifice) gain the year, Agni? how does it correspond 1 with the\nyear, with Agni?\' Well, for those five victims there are twenty-five kindling-\nverses, twelve \xc3\x82pri-verses,--that makes thirty-six;--eleven after-offerings,\neleven by-offerings 2,--that makes fifty-eight.\n\n6:2:2:3232\\. Now what forty-eight there are (in these fifty-eight), they are\nthe _G_ agati (metre) consisting of forty-eight syllables;--the _G_ agati\ndoubtless is this earth, for it is thereon that everything is that moves ( _g_\nagat); and Agni also is this earth, for it is thereof that the whole Agni is\nbuilt up: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this\nbecome 3.\n\n6:2:2:3333\\. And, again, why there are forty-eight;--of forty-eight syllables\nconsists the _G_ agati; the _G_ agati (comprises) all the metres; all the\nmetres are Pra _g_ apati (the sacrifice 4); and Pra _g_ apati is Agni as great\nas Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n6:2:2:3434\\. And what (remaining) ten there are (in those fifty-eight), they\nare the Vira _g_ , consisting of ten syllables; and the Vira _g_ is Agni,--\nthere are ten regions, and the regions are Agni; ten vital airs, and the vital\nairs are Agni: as great as Agni is,\n\np. 184\n\nas great as is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n6:2:2:3535\\. The omentum and the animal cake, that makes sixty;--sixty are the\ndays and nights of a month: thus he gains the month; the month gained gains\nthe season; and the season (gains) the year: he thus gains the year, Agni, and\nthe wishes which are contained in the year, and what other food than that\nthere is in the year, all that (he gains).\n\n6:2:2:3636\\. And for that (victim) of Pra _g_ apati there are twenty-one\nkindling-verses, and twelve \xc3\x82pri-verses, that makes thirty-three;--eleven\nafter-offerings, eleven by-offerings, that makes fifty-five;--omentum, animal\ncake, and chief oblation, that makes fifty-eight: whatever wish is contained\nin the fifty-eight, that he gains even here 1;--two libations of ghee, that\nmakes sixty: whatever wish is contained in the sixty, that he gains even here;\nand what other food than that there is in the year, all that (he gains).\n\n6:2:2:3737\\. And for that (victim) of (Vayu) Niyutvat, there are seventeen\nkindling-verses, and twelve \xc3\x82pri-verses, that makes twenty-nine;--eleven\nafter-offerings, and eleven by-offerings, that makes fifty-one;--omentum,\nanimal cake, and chief oblation, that makes fifty-four;--two libations of\nghee, two (oblations to Agni) Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, that makes fifty-eight:\nwhatever wish is contained in the fifty-eight, that he gains even here;--the\nwood-lord 2 (tree) and the oblation of gravy, that makes sixty: whatever wish\nis contained\n\np. 185\n\nin the sixty, that he gains even here, and what other food than that there is\nin the year, all that (he gains); and thus that sacrificial performance gains\nfor him the year, Agni; thus it (the animal sacrifice) corresponds with the\nyear, with Agni.\n\n6:2:2:3838\\. As to this they say, \'Of that animal he should offer no Samish\n_t_ aya _g_ us, nor should he go down with the heart-spit to the purificatory\nbath 1; for that animal (sacrifice) is the commencement of Agni; the Samish\n_t_ aya _g_ us are the gracious dismissal of the deities 2; and the\npurificatory bath is the completion;--lest he should at the very commencement\ndismiss the deities, and complete the sacrifice.\' Let him nevertheless\ncomplete (the sacrifice): Pra _g_ apati, having offered that animal, saw that\nhe had not reached the end of him, Agni,--let him therefore complete (the\nsacrifice). And, again, why he completes it;--that animal sacrifice is his\nvital air, and if anything were to cut him off from that, it would cut him off\nfrom the vital air; and if anything were to cut him off from the vital air, he\nwould thus die: let him therefore complete (the sacrifice). Now, then, as to\nthe vows (rites of abstinence).\n\n6:2:2:3939\\. Here now they say, \'After he has performed that animal offering,\nhe must not sleep upon (a couch), nor eat flesh, nor hold carnal intercourse;\nfor that animal sacrifice is the first Diksha, and improper surely it would\nbe, were the initiated to sleep upon (a couch), or were he to eat flesh, or\nhold carnal intercourse.\' But in no way is this a Diksha, for there is neither\na girdle, nor a black\n\np. 186\n\nantelope skin 1; but he makes this the first brick 2: let him therefore, if he\nlike, sleep upon (a couch); and whatever food animals here eat, all that is\nhere obtained and taken possession of by him; and whatever kinds of food there\nare other than honey, of all those he may eat at pleasure, if he can get them.\nCarnal intercourse, however, he may not hold prior to the (offering of)\nclotted curds to Mitra and Varu _n_ a 3: the purport of this (will be\nexplained) hereafter.\n\n6:2:2:4040\\. Here now they say, \'At this sacrifice he should give a Dakshi _n_\na (sacrificial gift); thinking, "Lest my sacrifice should be without a dakshi\n_n_ a!" let him give to the Brahman the prescribed dakshi _n_ a, for the\nBrahman is the entire sacrifice: thus the entire sacrifice of his becomes\nhealed.\' Let him not do so; for he makes this a brick, and it would be just as\nif he were to give a present with each brick: only at that (proper) time 4 let\nhim therefore give what it befits him (to give).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[172:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_347) Viz. the eleven ordinary gayatri verses raised, by\nrepetitions, to the number of fifteen; with six special trish _t_ ubh inserted\n([p. 167](sbe4131.htm#page_167), note [1](sbe4131.htm#fn_339)). Katy. XVI, 1,\n34.\n\n[172:2](sbe4132.htm#fr_348) On the two libations of ghee, see part i, p. 124\nnote; p. 128, n. 2. It is doubtful which of the two libations is intended\nhere; whether the first which in any case belongs to Pra _g_ apati, but is\nusually made with a different formula from the one prescribed here, or the\nsecond. The later ritualists themselves seem to have been doubtful on this\npoint; but Katyayana (XVI, 1, 35-37) leans to the opinion, that the second\nlibation must be intended; both libations thus being made to Pra _g_ apati on\nthis occasion. Saya _n_ a remarks,--hira _n_ yavatya _ri_ ka \'hira _n_\nyagarbha _h_ samavartatety\' ata uttara _m_ samaprakam (? samaprakaram) agharam\nagharayati; pra _g_ apatir vai hira _n_ yagarbha _h_ sa _k_ agnis tam evam\ntarpayitvapnotity abhipraya _h_.\n\n[172:3](sbe4132.htm#fr_349) That is, Va _g_. S. XXV, 10 (XIII, 4; Rd S. X,\n321, 1, \'Hira _n_ yagarbha _h_ samavartatagre\'), \'Hira _n_ yagarbha (the\ngolden child) came first into existence; he was born as the only lord of all\nbeing; he sustained this earth and sky: what god (or the god K a) shall we\nserve with offering.\'\n\n[173:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_350) See III, 8, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[173:2](sbe4132.htm#fr_351) See I, 1, 1, 13 with note.--The above verse, _Ri_\nk S. X, 121, I, and following five verses,--each of which ends with, \'what god\n(or the god Ka) shall we serve with offering,\'--are used with the omentum, the\nanimal cake (pa _s_ upuro _d_ a _s_ a), and the animal oblations respectively;\nviz. the first three verses as invitatory formulas (anuvakaya) and the last\nthree as offering formulas (ya _g_ ya). \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. III, 8, 1.--Va _g_. S.\nXXV, 10-13, only the first four verses are given together; whilst Saya _n_ a,\nin accordance with \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, remarks,--vapa puro _d_ a _s_ apa _s_ una\n_m_ \'hira _n_ yagarbha _h_ samavartatagra\' ity adaya _h_ syu _h_.\n\n[173:3](sbe4132.htm#fr_352) Probably \'niyuta _h_ \' here with allusion to\n\'niyuta,\' shut in.\n\n[174:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_353) That is, only two additional trish _t_ ubh verses\nare to be inserted between the 11 (or 15) gayatri ones.\n\n[175:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_354) The three chief oblations of the Animal Sacrifice,\nrequiring each an invitatory prayer (anuvakya) and an offering prayer (ya _g_\nya), are the omentum-oblation (vapa), the animal cake (pa _s_ upuro _d_ a _s_\na), and the meat oblations (pa _s_ u-havis). This is the order on the present\noccasion, whilst usually the cake-oblation succeeds the offering of meat\nportions. Now the first of the three invitatory prayers (that of the omentum),\nviz. Va _g_. S. XXVII, 26 ( _Ri_ k S. X, 121, 8), and the last of the three\noffering prayers (that of the meat portions), viz. Va _g_. S. XXVII, 25 ( _Ri_\nk S. X, 121, 7), end with the refrain, \'what god (or, the god Ka) should we\nserve with offering.\' Thus, then, the first and the last of the six formulas\nwould be p. 176 addressed to Pra _g_ apati; and to him is also exceptionally\noffered the animal cake, which is here assigned the central position, and\nwhich, in the normal sacrificial order, would belong to the recipient of the\nanimal sacrifice itself, or in the present case, to Vayu Niyutvat. Saya _n_ a,\non the other hand, makes the above two verses, containing the word Ka, the\ninvitatory and offering prayers of the cake-offering, as the MS. makes him\nsay,--kadvatyau ya _g_ yanuvakye puro _d_ a _s_ asya, \'apo ha yad b _ri_\nhatir\' ( _Ri_ k S. X, 121, 7), \'ya _s_ _k_ id apo\' (X, 121, 8) ity ete. This,\nindeed, would also seem to be the opinion of Katyayana, whose rules (XVI, I,\n39-43) are,--39. To Pra _g_ apati belongs the animal cake at both (animal\nsacrifices); 40. The offering and invitatory formulas of the Pra _g_ apatya\n(animal sacrifice) contain the word \'Ka;\' 41. Those of the Vayavya contain the\nword \'bright;\' 42. Optionally so, those of the omentum (but not at the meat\nportion, commentary); 43. The remainder is equal in all (three views).--Now it\nwould indeed be the most natural, that the formulas of the cake-offering, here\nexceptionally assigned to Pra _g_ apati, should be made to correspond to that\ndeity; but the order in which the formulas are given in the Va _g_. S. XXVII,\n23-28 (cf. \xc3\x82 _s_ val. III, 8, I, as well as [paragraph\n13](sbe4132.htm#6:2:2:13) above, seems to favour the first view; though the\nnext paragraph shows that there were differences of opinion on this point. Cf.\nnext note.\n\n[176:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_355) The form of Pra _g_ apati which has a team of\nhorses is Vayu, the god of wind; while his bright forms are represented by\nAgni, the fire (VI, I, 3, 20, \'Agni is all bright things\').--Va _g_. S. XXVII,\n29-34 gives six verses for use as invitatory and offering formulas p. 177 at\nthe ish _t_ akapa _s_ u to Vayu. Five of these contain the word \'niyut,\' team,\nbut only the first two contain the word \' _s_ ukra\' (bright): these two are\npresumably to be used on the present occasion; though I am at a loss to see\nwhat other two verses containing the word \'bright\' are to be used; unless\nindeed \' _s_ uklavatya _h_ \' in the text means verses containing some word for\n\'bright,\' in which case the ordinary verses used at an animal offering to Vayu\nNiyutvat, viz. Va _g_. S. XXVII, 23 and 24 ( _Ri_ k S. VII, 91, 3; 90, 3)\nwhich contain the word \' _s_ veta\' (white, light), might be used. The MS. of\nSaya _n_ a\'s commentary is unfortunately very corrupt in this place; it\nalludes to the latter two verses, but whether to recommend them, or set them\naside, for the present occasion, is not clear. He does, however, specially\nexcept the formulas of the animal cake from being included in the above\nspecification. In the view put forth in [paragraph 14](sbe4132.htm#6:2:2:14),\nthe above-mentioned two verses would apparently have to be used for the\nomentum-oblation, the two verses containing \'Ka\' for the cake-oblation, and\n(any) two verses containing the word \'team\' (either the ordinary ones, _Ri_ k\nS. VII, 92, 5; VI, 49, 4; or some of the special ones) for the meat-oblation.\n\n[178:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_356) Saya _n_ a here supplies \'let him perform that,\'--\nesham karma _n_ a _m_ madhye yat karmasya sampadyeta tat kuryad iti _s_ esha\n_h_ ; but he then adds, that the pronoun \'it\' (tam) at the beginning of the\nnext paragraph is caused by proximity of the Niyutvatiya.\n\n[178:2](sbe4132.htm#fr_357) See I, 6, 4, 5. \'Now this king Soma, the food of\nthe gods, is no other than the moon. When he (the moon, masc.) is not seen\nthat night either in the east or in the west, then he visits this world, and\nhere he enters into the waters (f.) and plants (f.).\' Thus Pra _g_ apati is\nhere identified with Soma, the moon, and food.\n\n[178:3](sbe4132.htm#fr_358) Cp. I, 6, 4, 12-13. \'The full-moon oblation,\nassuredly, belongs to the V _ri_ tra-slayer, for by means of it Indra slew V\n_ri_ tra; and this new-moon oblation also represents the slaying of V _ri_\ntra, since they prepared that invigorating draught for him who had slain V\n_ri_ tra. An offering in honour of the V _ri_ tra-slayer, then, is the full-\nmoon sacrifice. V _ri_ tra, assuredly, is no other than the moon; and when\nduring that night (of new moon) he is not seen either in the east or in the\nwest, then he (Indra) finishes in destroying him by means of that (new-moon\nsacrifice), and leaves nothing remaining of him.\'\n\n[179:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_359) In the older division of the year the first or\nspring season (vasanta) begins with the month of Phalguna, that is the month\nwhen the moon is in conjunction with the nakshatra of the Uttare Phalguni,\nwhence that full moon, in the Kaush. Br. 5, 1, is called the mouth, and that\nof the first Phalguni the tail, of the year. See A. Weber, Nachrichten von den\nNaxatra, II, p. 329. In the above, somewhat bold figure, we are, Saya _n_ a\nreminds us, to understand the fifteenth or last day (of the dark fortnight) of\nthe first Phalguni, and the pratipad, or first day of the second Phalguni.\n\n[179:2](sbe4132.htm#fr_360) That is, the construction of the fire-altar.\n\n[180:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_361) For the construction of the fire-pan, in which the\nsacred fire has to be kept up for a year, during which the initiation-ceremony\nis repeated day after day, see [VI, 5, 2, 1](sbe4142.htm#6:5:2:1) seq.\n\n[180:2](sbe4132.htm#fr_362) There is kept up in these paragraphs a play on the\nword \'loka,\' meaning both \'space\' and \'world (or place of living),\'--and\napplying both to the space occupied by a brick, in building up the altar; and\nto the place which the Sacrificer, by this performance, gains for himself in\nanother world. The initiation period is here represented p. 181 as the time\nduring which the Sacrificer prepares both the requisite space for the altar\n(as it were, adding day by day so many brick-spaces, thus becoming available\nfor the altar-pile at the time of construction), and an adequate place for\nhimself in the celestial regions.\n\n[181:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_363) That is, man receives, in a future existence, the\nreward or punishment for his deeds during this life.\n\n[181:2](sbe4132.htm#fr_364) The author argues in support of the orthodox\ninitiation-period of just one year, as just the amount of time required for\npreparing the exact amount of space (or brick-spaces) requisite for an altar\nof proper size. If the initiation were to last less than a year, he would not\nhave had sufficient time to prepare the necessary amount of space, or rather,\nnumber of spaces required for the bricks; and, by implication, he would not\nacquire for himself an adequate place hereafter.\n\n[181:3](sbe4132.htm#fr_365) That is to say, if he were to make the initiation-\nperiod last longer than a year, thus providing for more space than his supply\nof bricks would suffice to fill up.\n\n[181:4](sbe4132.htm#fr_366) That is, after the expiration of the period of\ninitiation, or just a year after the commencement of the latter.\n\n[182:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_367) That is, during the days from the commencement to\nthe completion of the altar. These are the upasad-days (part ii, p. 104 seq.),\nthe number of which varies from three days up to three years. During this\nperiod the Upasads have to be performed twice daily, and in the interval\nbetween the two performances the building of the altar takes place, a certain\nnumber of bricks being added each day.\n\n[182:2](sbe4132.htm#fr_368) Or, rather, the correspondence, in toto, of the\nsacrificial performance with the object to be attained, viz. Agni, the fire-\naltar.\n\n[183:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_369) Or, come up to, tally with,--katha _m_ sa _m_\nvatsare _n_ a sampadyate sa _m_ ga _k_ _kh_ ate\xe0\xa4\xbdvayavasamyena, Say.\n\n[183:2](sbe4132.htm#fr_370) For these supplementary oblations at the animal\nsacrifice, see III, 8, 4, 10 seq.\n\n[183:3](sbe4132.htm#fr_371) That is, the animal sacrifice that has been\nperformed is thus made out to be equal to Agni, or to the object for which it\nwas performed.\n\n[183:4](sbe4132.htm#fr_372) That is, because all the metres are employed in\nthe chants and recitations during the sacrifice.\n\n[184:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_373) ? That is, also in this calculation, or in the\nparts of the sacrifice here enumerated.\n\n[184:2](sbe4132.htm#fr_374) For the oblation to Vanaspati, see part ii, p.\n208; for the vasahoma, ib. 205.\n\n[185:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_375) See III, 8, 5, 8 seq.\n\n[185:2](sbe4132.htm#fr_376) See I, 9, 2, 26-27.\n\n[186:1](sbe4132.htm#fr_377) For the antelope skin used at the initiation-\nceremony, see III, 2, 1, 1; for the girdle, ib. 10.\n\n[186:2](sbe4132.htm#fr_378) See above, [VI, 2, 1, 20](sbe4131.htm#6:2:1:20).\n\n[186:3](sbe4132.htm#fr_379) This is the concluding oblation of the Soma-\nsacrifice, performed at the close of the Agni _k_ ayana; see IX, 5, 1, 54.\n\n[186:4](sbe4132.htm#fr_380) Viz. at the proper time when the priests receive\ntheir fees, after the mid-day Soma-service, see part ii, p. 340.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 2, 3.
