Built up in the\nSelf by its being bound by disguise of intellect--\n\nIs this existence as the _separate_ life, for there is no other than the Self,\ndistinguished by its own nature, but the binding of the Self by the intellect\nis false, coming from unknowledge.\n\nThis binding is untied by perfect knowledge, not otherwise; the discerning of\nthe oneness of the Eternal and the Self is held by the scripture to be perfect\nknowledge.\n\nAnd this is accomplished by perfectly discerning between Self and not-self;\nthereafter discernment is to be gained between individual and universal Self.\n\nWater may be endlessly muddy, but when the mud is gone, the water is clear. As\nit shines, so shines the Self also, when faults are gone away, it shines forth\nclear.\n\nAnd when unreality ceases to exist in the individual self, it is clear that it\nreturns towards the universal;\n\np. 37\n\nhence there is to be a rejection of the self-assertion and other\ncharacteristics of the individual self.\n\nHence this higher Self is not what is called the intellectual veil, because\nthat is changeful, helpless of itself, circumscribed, objective, liable to\nerr; the non-eternal cannot be regarded as eternal.\n\nThe bliss-formed veil is a form containing the reflection of bliss--although\nit is tainted with darkness; it has the quality of pleasure, the attainment of\nwell wished-for aims; it shines forth in the enjoyment of good works by a\nrighteous man, of its own nature bliss-formed; gaining an excellent form, he\nenjoys bliss without effort.\n\nThe principal sphere of the bliss-formed veil is in dreamless sleep; in\ndreaming and waking it is in part manifest when blissful objects are beheld.\n\nNor is this bliss-formed veil the higher Self, for it wears a disguise, it is\na form of objective nature; it is an effect caused by good acts, accumulated\nin this changeful form.\n\nWhen the five veils are taken away, according to inference and scripture, what\nremains after they are taken away is the Witness, in a form born of awakening.\n\nThis is the Self, self-shining, distinguished from the five veils; this is the\nWitness in the three modes _of perceiving_ , without change, without stain.\nThe wise should know it as Being and Bliss, as his own Self.\n\n### THE PUPIL SAID:\n\n(Verses 210--240)\n\nWhen the five veils are thus set aside through their\n\np. 38\n\nunreality, beyond the non-being of all I see nothing, Master; what then is to\nbe known as anything by him who knows Self and not-self?\n\n### THE MASTER SAID:\n\nTruth has been spoken by thee, wise one; thou art skilled in judgment. Self-\nassertion and all these changes,--in the Self they have no being. That whereby\nall is enjoyed, but which is itself not enjoyed, know that to be the Self, the\nKnower, through thy very subtle intellect.\n\nWhatever is enjoyed by anyone, of that he is the witness; but of that which is\nnot enjoyed by anyone, it cannot be said that anyone is the witness.\n\nThat is to be self-witness, where anything is enjoyed by itself; therefore the\nuniversal Self is witness of itself; no other lesser thing is witness of it.\n\nIn waking, dreaming, dreamlessness, that Self is clearly manifested, appearing\nthrough its universal form always as "I," as the "I" within, uniformly. This\nis "I" beholding intellect and the rest that partake of varied forms and\nchanges. It is manifest through eternal blissful self-consciousness; know that\nas the Self here in the heart.\n\nLooking at the reflection of the sun reflected in the water of a jar, he who\nis deluded thinks it is the sun, thus the reflected consciousness appearing\nunder a disguise is thought by him who is hopelessly deluded to be "I."\n\nRejecting jar and water and the sun reflected there all together, the real sun\nis beheld. So the unchanging\n\np. 39\n\n[paragraph continues] One which is reflected in the three modes, self-shining,\nis perceived by the wise.\n\nPutting away in thought body and intellect as alike reflections of\nconsciousness, discerning the seer, hid in the secret place, the Self, the\npartless awakening, the universal shining, distinguished alike from what\nexists and what does not exist; the eternal lord, all-present, very subtle,\ndevoid of within and without, nothing but self; discerning this perfectly, in\nits own form, a man is sinless, passionless, deathless.\n\nSorrowless, altogether bliss, full of wisdom, fearing nothing at all from\nanything; there is no other path of freedom from the bondage of the world but\nknowledge of the reality of his Self, for him who would be free.\n\nKnowledge that the Eternal is not divided _from him_ is the cause of freedom\nfrom the world, whereby the Eternal, the secondless bliss, is gained by the\nawakened.\n\nTherefore one should perfectly know that the Eternal and the Self are not\ndivided; for the wise who has become the Eternal does not return again to\nbirth and death.\n\nThe real, wisdom, the endless, the Eternal, pure, supreme, self-perfect, the\none essence of eternal bliss, universal, undivided, unbroken--this he gains.\n\nThis is the real, supreme, secondless, for besides the Self no other is; there\nis nothing else at all in the condition of perfect awakening to the reality of\nthe supreme being.\n\nThis all, that is perceived as the vari-form world, from unknowledge, this all\nis the Eternal, when the mind\'s confusion is cast away.\n\np. 40\n\nThe pot made of clay is not separate from the clay, for all through it is in\nits own nature clay; the form of the pot is not separate; whence then the pot?\nIt is mere name, built up of illusion.\n\nBy no one can the form of the pot be seen, separate from the clay; hence the\npot is built of delusion, but the real thing is the clay, like the supreme\nBeing.\n\nAll this is always an effect of the real Eternal; it is that alone, nor is\nthere anything else but that. He who says there is, is not free from delusion,\nlike one who talks in his sleep.\n\nThe Eternal verily is this all; thus says the excellent scripture of the\n_Atharva_. In accordance with it, all this is the Eternal only, nor is there\nany separate existence of the attribute apart from the source.\n\nIf this moving world were the real, then had the Self no freedom from\nlimitation, divine authority no worth, the Master Self no truth; these three\nthings the great-souled cannot allow.\n\nThe Master who knows the reality of things declared: I verily am not contained\nin these things, nor do these creatures stand in me. If the world be real,\nthen it should be apprehended in dreamless sleep; it is not apprehended there,\ntherefore it is unreal, dreamlike, false. Therefore the world is not separate\nfrom the higher Self; what is perceived as separate is false,--the natural\npotencies and the like; what real existence is there in the attribute? Its\nsupport shines forth as _with attributes_ illusively.\n\nWhatever is delusively perceived by one deluded, is the Eternal; the silver\nshining is only the pearl shell.\n\np. 41\n\n[paragraph continues] The Eternal is perpetually conceived as formed; but what\nis attributed to the Eternal is a name only.\n\nTherefore the supreme Eternal is Being, secondless, of the form of pure\nknowledge, stainless, peaceful, free from beginning or ending, changeless, its\nown-nature is unbroken bliss.\n\nEvery difference made by world-glamor set aside, eternal, lasting, partless,\nmeasureless, formless, unmanifest, nameless, unfading, a self-shining light\nthat illuminates all that is.\n\nWhere the difference of knower, knowing, known is gone, endless, sure;\nabsolute, partless, pure consciousness; the wise know this as the supreme\nreality.\n\nThat can neither be left nor taken, is no object of mind or speech;\nimmeasurable, beginningless, endless, the perfect Eternal, the universal "I."\n\n### THAT THOU ART\n\n(Verses 241--251)\n\nThe Eternal and the Self, indicated by the two words "that" and "thou," when\nclearly understood, according to the Scripture "THAT THOU ART," are one; their\noneness is again ascertained.\n\nThis identity of theirs is in their essential, not their verbal meanings, for\nthey are _apparently_ of contradictory character; like the firefly and the\nsun, the sovereign and the serf, the well and the great waters, the atom and\nMount Meru.\n\nThe contradiction between them is built up by their disguises, but this\ndisguise is no real thing at all; the disguise of the Master Self is the\nworld-glamor, the\n\np. 42\n\ncause of the Celestial and other worlds; the disguise of the _individual_ life\nis the group of five veils--hear this now:\n\nThese are the two disguises, of the Supreme and the _individual_ life; when\nthey are set aside together, there is no longer the Supreme nor the\n_individual_ life. The king has his kingdom, the warrior his weapons; when\nthese are put away there is neither warrior nor king.\n\nAccording to the Scripture saying, "this is the instruction, _the Self is not\nthat, not that_ ," the twofoldness that was built up sinks away of itself in\nthe Eternal; let the truth of this scripture be grasped through awakening; the\nputting away of the two disguises must verily be accomplished.\n\nIt is not this, it is not this: because this is built up, it is not the real--\nlike the serpent seen in the rope, or like a dream; thus putting away every\nvisible thing by wise meditation, the oneness of the two-- _Self and Eternal_\n\\--is then to be known.\n\nTherefore the two are to be well observed in their essential unity. Neither\ntheir contradictory character nor their non-contradictory character is all;\nbut the real and essential Being is to be reached, in order to gain the\nessence in which they are one and undivided.\n\nWhen one says: "This man is Devadatta," the oneness is here stated by\nrejecting contradictory qualities. With the great word "THAT THOU ART," it is\nthe same; what is contradictory between the two is set aside.\n\nAs being essentially pure consciousness, the oneness between the Real and the\nSelf is known by the awakened; and by hundreds of great texts the oneness, the\n\np. 43\n\nabsence of separateness, between the Eternal and the Self is declared.\n\nThat is not the physical; it is the perfect, after the unreal is put aside;\nlike the ether, not to be handled by thought. Hence this matter that is\nperceived is illusive, therefore set it aside; but what is grasped by its own\nselfhood--"that I am the Eternal"--know that with intelligence purified; know\nthe Self as partless awakening.\n\nEvery pot and vessel has always clay as its cause, and its material is clay;\njust like this, this world is engendered by the Real, and has the Real as its\nSelf, the Real is its material altogether. That Real than which there is none\nhigher, THAT THOU ART, the restful, the stainless, secondless Eternal, the\nsupreme.\n\n### THE MANIFEST AND THE HIDDEN SELF\n\n(Verses 252--268)\n\nAs dream-built lands and times, objects and knowers of them, are all unreal,\njust so here in waking is this world; its cause is ignorance of the Self; in\nas much as all this world, body and organs, vital breath and personality are\nall unreal, in so much THOU ART THAT, the restful, the stainless, secondless\nEternal, the supreme.\n\nFar away from birth and conduct, family and tribe, quite free from name and\nform and quality and fault; beyond space and time and objects--this is the\nEternal, THAT THOU ART; become it in the Self.\n\nThe supreme, that no word can reach, but that is reached by the eye of\nawakening, pure of stain, the pure reality of consciousness and mind together\n--this is\n\np. 44\n\nthe Eternal, THAT THOU ART; become it in the Self. Untouched by the six\ninfirmities, reached in the heart of those that seek for union, reached not by\nthe organs, whose being neither intellect nor reason knows--this is the\nEternal, THAT THOU ART; become it in the Self.\n\nBuilt of error is the world; in That it rests; That rests in itself, different\nfrom the existent and the nonexistent; partless, nor bound by causality, is\nthe Eternal, THAT THOU ART; become it in the Self.\n\nBirth and growth, decline and loss, sickness and death it is free from, and\nunfading; the cause of emanation, preservation, destruction, is the Eternal,\nTHAT THOU ART; become it in the Self.\n\nWhere all difference is cast aside, all distinction is cast away, a waveless\nocean, motionless; ever free, with undivided form--this is the Eternal, THAT\nTHOU ART; become it in the Self.\n\nBeing one, though cause of many, the cause of others, with no cause itself;\nwhere cause and caused are merged in one, self-being, the Eternal, THAT THOU\nART; become it in the Self.\n\nFree from doubt and change, great, unchanging; where changing and unchanging\nare merged in one Supreme; eternal, unfading joy, unstained--this is the\nEternal, THAT THOU ART; become it in the Self.\n\nThis shines forth manifold through error, through being the Self under name\nand form and quality and change; like gold itself unchanging ever--this is the\nEternal, THAT THOU ART; become it in the Self.\n\nThis shines out unchanging, higher than the highest, the hidden one essence,\nwhose character is selfhood,\n\np. 45\n\nreality, consciousness, joy, endless unfading--this is the Eternal, THAT THOU\nART; become it in the Self.\n\nLet a man make it his own in the Self--like a word that is spoken, by\nreasoning from the known, by thought; this is as devoid of doubt as water in\nthe hand, so certain will its reality become.\n\nRecognizing this perfectly illumined one, whose reality is altogether pure, as\n_one recognizes_ the leader of men in the assembled army, and resting on that\nalways, standing firm in one\'s own Self, sink all this world that is born,\ninto the Eternal.\n\nIn the soul, in the hidden place, marked neither as what is nor what is not,\nis the Eternal, true, supreme, secondless. He who through the Self dwells here\nin the secret place, for him there is no coming forth again to the world of\nform.\n\nWhen the thing is well known even, this beginningless mode of thought, "I am\nthe doer and the enjoyer," is very powerful; this mode of mind lasting\nstrongly, is the cause of birth and rebirth. A looking backward toward the\nSelf, a dwelling on it, is to be effortfully gained; freedom here on earth,\nsay the saints, is the thinning away of that mode of thought.\n\nThat thought of \'I\' and \'mine\' in the flesh, the eye and the rest, that are\nnot the Self--this transference _from the real to the unreal_ is to be cast\naway by the wise man by steadfastness in his own Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Finding the Real Self](cjw08.htm)\n\n'
