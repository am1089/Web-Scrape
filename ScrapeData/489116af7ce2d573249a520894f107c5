 \nAgain the deadly fight began,  \nAnd fiercely at the giant ran.  \nUnmoved the monster kept his place:  \nHe raised on high his awful mace,  \nWhirled the huge weapon round his head  \nAnd laid the foremost Vanars'dead.  \nEight thousand fell bedewed with gore,  \nThen sank and died seven hundred more.  \nThen thirty, twenty, ten, or eight  \nAt each fierce onset met their fate,  \nAnd fast the fallen were devoured  \nLike snakes by Garud's beak o'erpowered.  \nThen Dwivid from the Vanar van.  \nArmed with an uptorn mountain, ran,  \nLike a huge cloud when fierce winds blow,  \nAnd charged amain the mountain foe.  \nWith wondrous force the hill he threw:  \nO'er Kumbhakarna's head it flew,  \nAnd falling on his host afar  \nCrushed many a giant, steed, and car.  \nRocks, trees, by fierce Hanuman sped,  \nRained fast on Kumbhakrna's head.  \nWhose spear each deadlier missile stopped,  \nAnd harmless on the plain it dropped.  \n\np. 478  \n\nThen with his furious eyes aglow  \nThe giant rushed upon the foe,  \nWhere, with a woody hill upheaved,  \nHanuman's might his charge received.  \nThrough his vast frame the giant felt  \nThe angry blow Hanuman dealt.  \nHe reeled a moment, sure distressed,  \nThen smote the Vanar on the breast,  \nAs when the War-God's furious stroke  \nThrough Krauncha's hill a passage broke.  1  \nFierce was the blow, and deep and wide  \nThe rent: with crimson torrents dyed,  \nHanuman, maddened by the pain,  \nRoared like a cloud that brings the rain,  \nAnd from each Rakshas throat rang out  \nLoud clamour and exultant shout.  \nThen Nila hurled with mustered might  \nThe fragment of a mountain height;  \nNor would the rock the foe have missed,  \nBut Kumbhakarna raised his fist  \nAnd smote so fiercely that the mass  \nFell crushed to powder on the grass.  \nFive chieftains of the Vanar race  2  \nCharged Kumbhakarna face to face,  \nAnd his huge frame they wildly beat  \nWith rocks and trees and hands and feet.  \nRound Rishabh first the giant wound  \nHis arms and hurled him to the ground,  \nWhere speechless, senseless, wounded sore,  \nHe lay his face besmeared with gore.  \nThen Nila with his fist he slew,  \nAnd S'arabh with his knee o'erthrew,  \nNor could Gavaksha's strength withstand  \nThe force of his terrific hand.  \nAt Gandhamadan's eager call  \nRushed thousands to avenge their fall,  \nNor ceased those Vanars to assail  \nWith knee and fist and tooth and nail.  \nAround his foes the giant threw  \nHis mighty arms, and nearer drew  \nThe captives subject to his will:  \nThen snatched them up and ate his fill.  \nThere was no respite then, no pause:  \nFast gaped and closed his hell-like jaws:  \nYet, prisoned in that gloomy cave,  \nSome Vanars still their lives could save:  \nSome through his nostrils found a way,  \nSome through his ears resought the day.  \nLike Indra with his thunder, like  \n\nThe God of Death in act to strike,  \nThe giant seized his ponderous spear,  \nAnd charged the foe in swift career.  \nBefore his might the Vanars fell,  \nNor could their hosts his charge repel.  \nThen trembling, nor ashamed to run,  \nThey turned and fled to Raghu's son.  \n   When Bali's warrior son  1b beheld  \nTheir flight, his heart with fury swelled.  \nHe rushed, with his terrific shout,  \nTo meet the foe and stay the rout.  \nHe came, he hurled a mountain peak,  \nAnd smote the giant on the cheek.  \nHis ponderous spear the giant threw:  \nFierce was the cast, the aim was true;  \nBut Angad, trained in war and tried,  \nSaw ere it came, and leapt aside.  \nThen with his open hand he smote  \nThe giant on the chest and throat.  \nThat blow the giant scarce sustained;  \nBut sense and strength were soon regained.  \nWith force which nothing might resist  \nHe caught the Vanar by the wrist,  \nWhirled him, as if in pastime, round,  \nAnd dashed him senseless on the ground.  \nThere low on earth his foe lay crushed:  \nAt King Sugriva next he rushed,  \nWho, waiting for the charge, stood still,  \nAnd heaved on high a shattered hill,  \nHe looked on Kumbhakarna dyed  \nWith streams of blood, and fiercely cried:  \n'Great glory has thine arm achieved,  \nAnd thousands of their lives bereaved.  \nNow leave a while thy meaner foes,  \nAnd brook the hill Sugriva throws.'  \n   He spoke, and hurled the mass he held:  \nThe giant's chest the stroke repelled,  \nThen on the Vanars fell despair,  \nAnd Rakshas clamour filled the air.  \nThe giant raised his arm, and fast  \nCame the tremendous  2b spear he cast.  \nHanuman caught it as it flew,  \nAnd knapped it on his knee in two.  \nThe giant saw the broken spear:  \nHis clouded eye confessed his fear;  \nYet at Sugriva's head he sent  \nA peak from Lanka's mountain rent.  \n\np. 479  \n\nThe rushing mass no might could stay:  \nSugriva fell and senseless lay.  \nThe giant stooped his foe to seize,  \nAnd bore him thence, as bears the breeze  \nA cloud in autumn through the sky.  \nHe heard the sad Immortals sigh,  \nAnd shouts of triumph long and loud  \nWent up from all the Rakshas crowd.  \nThrough Lanka's gate the giant passed  \nHolding his struggling captive fast,  \nWhile from each terrace, house, and tower  \nFell on his haughty head a shower  \nOf fragrant scent and flowery rain,  \nBlossoms and leaves and scattered grain.  1  \n   By slow degrees the Vanars' lord  \nFelt life and sense and strength restored.  \nHe heard the giants' joyful boast:  \nHe thought upon his Vanar host.  \nHis teeth and feet he fiercely plied.  \nAnd bit and rent the giant's side,  \nWho, mad with pain and smeared with gore,  \nHurled to the ground the load he bore.  \nRegardless of a storm of blows  \nSwift to the sky the Vanar rose,  \nThen lightly like a flying ball  \nHigh overleapt the city wall,  \nAnd joyous for deliverance won  \nRegained the side of Raghu s son.  \nAnd Kumbhakarna, mad with hate  \nAnd fury, sallied from the gate,  \nThe carnage of the foe renewed  \nAnd filled his maw with gory food.  \nSlaying, with headlong frenzy blind,  \nBoth Vanar foes and giant kind.  \n   Nor would Sumitra's valiant son  2  \nThe might of Kumbhakarna shun,  \nWho through his harness felt the sting  \nOf keen shafts loosened from the string.  \nHis heart confessed the warrior's power,  \nAnd, bleeding from the ceaseless shower  \nThat smote him on the chest and side,  \nWith words like these the giant cried:  \n'Well fought, well fought, Sumitra's son;  \nEternal glory hast thou won,  \nFor thou in desperate fight hast met  \nThe victor never conquered yet,  \nWhom, borne on huge Airavat's back,  \nE'en Indra trembles to attack,  \nGo, son of Queen Sumitra, go:  \nThy valour and thy strength I know.  \nNow all my hope and earnest will  \nIs Rama in the fight to kill.  \nLet him beneath my weapons fall,  \nAnd I will meet and conquer all.'  \n\nThe chieftain, of Sumitra born,  \nMade answer as he laughed in scorn:  \n'Yea, thou hast won a victor's fame  \nFrom trembling Gods and Indra's shame.  \nThere waits thee now a mightier foe  \nWhose prowess thou hast yet to know.  \nThere, famous in a hundred lands,  \nRama the son of Raghu stands.'  \n   Straight at the king the giant sped,  \nAnd earth was shaken at his tread.  \nHis bow the hero grasped and strained,  \nAnd deadly shafts in torrents rained.  \nAs Kumbhakarna felt each stroke  \nFrom his huge mouth burst fire and smoke;  \nHis hands were loosed in mortal pain  \nAnd dropped his weapons on the plain.  \nThough reft of spear and sword and mace  \nNo terror changed his haughty face.  \nWith heavy hands he rained his blows  \nAnd smote to death a thousand foes.  \nWhere'er the furious monster strode  \nWhile down his limbs the red blood flowed  \nLike torrents down a mountain's side,  \nVanars and bears and giants died.  \nHigh o'er his head a rock he swung,  \nAnd the huge mass at Rama flung.  \nBut Rama's arrows bright as flame  \nShattered the mountain as it came.  \nThen Raghu's son, his eyes aglow  \nWith burning anger, charged the foe,  \nAnd as his bow he strained and tried  \nWith fearful clang the cord replied.  \nWroth at the bowstring's threatening clang  \nTo meet his foe the giant sprang.  \nHigh towering with enormous frame  \nHuge as a wood-crowned hill he came.  \nBut Rama firm and self-possessed  \nIn words like these the foe addressed:  \n'Draw near, O Rakshas lord, draw near,  \nNor turn thee from the fight in fear.  \nThou meetest Rama face to faoe,  \nDestroyer of the giant race.  \nCome, fight, and thou shalt feel this hour.  \nLaid low in death, thy conqueror's power.'  \n   He ceased: and mad with wrath and pride  \nThe giant champion thus replied:  \n'Come thou to me and thou shalt find  \nA foeman of a different kind.  \nNo Khara, no Viradha,--thou  \nHast met a mightier warrior now.  \nThe strength of Kumbhakarna fear,  \nAnd dread the iron mace I rear  \nThis mace in days of yore subdued  \nThe Gods and Danav multitude.  \nProve, lion of Ikshvaku's line.  \nThy power upon these limbs of mine.  \nThen, after trial, shalt thou bleed,  \nAnd with thy flesh my hunger feed.'  \n  He ceased and Rama, undismayed,  \nUpon his cord those arrows laid  \n\np. 480  \n\nWhich pierced the stately Sal trees through,  \nAnd Bali king of Vanars slew.  \nThey flew, they smote, but smote in vain  \nThose mighty limbs that felt no pain.  \nThen Rama sent with surest aim  \nThe dart that bore the Wind-God's name.  \nThe missile from the giant tore  \nHis huge arm and the mace it bore,  \nWhich crushed the Vanars where it fell:  \nAnd dire was Kumbhakarna's yell.  \nThe giant seized a tree, and then  \nRushed madly at the lord of men.  \nAnother dart, Lord Indra's own,  \nTo meet his furious onset thrown,  \nHis left arm from the shoulder lopped,  \nAnd like a mountain peak it dropped.  \nThen from the bow of Rama sped  \nTwo arrows, each with crescent head;  \nAnd, winged with might which naught could stay,  \nThey cut the giant's legs away.  \nThey fell, and awful was the sound  \nAs those vast columns shook the ground;  \nAnd sky and sea and hill and cave  \nIn echoing roars their answer gave.  \nThen from his side the hero drew  \nA dart that like the tempest flew--  \nNo deadlier shaft has ever flown  \nThan that which Indra called his own--  \nNor could the giant's mail-armed neck  \nThe fury of the missile check.  \nThrough skin and flesh and bone it smote  \nAnd rent asunder head and throat.  \nDown with the sound of thunder rolled  \nThe head adorned with rings of gold,  \nAnd crushed to pieces in its fall  \nA gate, a tower, a massive wall.  \nHurled to the sea the body fell:  \nTerrific was the ocean's swell,  \nNor could swift fin and nimble leap  \nSave the crushed creatures of the deep.  \n\nThus he who plagued in impious pride  \nThe Gods and Brahmans fought and died.  \nGlad were the hosts of heaven, and long  \nThe air re-echoed with their song.  1  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[478:1](ry463.htm#fr_994) Karttikeya the God of War, and the hero and\nincarnation Paras'urama are said to have cut a passage through the mountain\nKrauncha, a part of the Himalayan range, in the same way as the immense gorge\nthat splits the Pyrenees under the towers of Marbore was cloven at one blow of\nRoland's sword Durandal.\n\n[478:2](ry463.htm#fr_995) Rishabn, S'arabh, Nila, Gavaksha, and Gandhamadan.\n\n[478:1b](ry463.htm#fr_996) Angad.

There are many verses in this Canto which European scholars would\nrigidly exclude as unmistakeably the work of later rhapsodists. Even the\nreverent Commentator whom I follow ventures to remark once or twice: _Ayam\ns'loka prak shipta iti bahavah_ , 'This _s'loka_ or verse is in the opinion of\nmany interpolated.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXVIII.: Ravan's Lament.](ry464.htm)\n\n"
