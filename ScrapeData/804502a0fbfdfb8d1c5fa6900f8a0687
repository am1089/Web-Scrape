He shook his head gravely.\n"I see no good in this," said he--"this setting aside of conscience and\nputting the country in its place. All the sins of the country will now break\nout, hideous and unashamed."\n\n"Who do you think could have ..."\n\n"Don\'t ask me. But sin is rampant. Send them all away, right away from here."\n\n"I have given them one more day. They will be leaving the day after tomorrow."\n\n"And another thing. Take Bimala away to Calcutta. She is getting too narrow a\nview of the outside world from here, she cannot see men and things in their\ntrue proportions. Let her see the world--men and their work--give her abroad\nvision."\n\n"That is exactly what I was thinking."\n\n"Well, don\'t make any delay about it. I tell you, Nikhil, man\'s history has to\nbe built by the united effort of all the races in the world, and therefore\nthis selling of conscience for political reasons--this making a fetish of\none\'s country, won\'t do. I know that Europe does not at heart admit this, but\nthere she has not the right to pose as our teacher. Men who die for the truth\nbecome immortal: and, if a whole people can die for the truth, it will also\nachieve immortality in the history of humanity. Here, in this land of India,\namid the mocking laughter of Satan piercing the sky, may the feeling for this\ntruth become real! What a terrible epidemic of sin has been brought into our\ncountry from foreign lands..."\n\nThe whole day passed in the turmoil of investigation. I was tired out when I\nretired for the night. I left over sending my sister-in-law\'s money to the\ntreasury till next morning.\n\nI woke up from my sleep at dead of night. The room was dark. I thought I heard\na moaning somewhere. Somebody must have been crying. Sounds of sobbing came\nheavy with tears like fitful gusts of wind in the rainy night. It seemed to me\nthat the cry rose from the heart of my room itself. I was alone. For some days\nBimala had her bed in another room adjoining mine. I rose up and when I went\nout I found her in the balcony lying prone upon her face on the bare floor.\n\nThis is something that cannot be written in words. He only knows it who sits\nin the bosom of the world and receives all its pangs in His own heart. The sky\nis dumb, the stars are mute, the night is still, and in the midst of it all\nthat one sleepless cry!\n\nWe give these sufferings names, bad or good, according to the classifications\nof the books, but this agony which is welling up from a torn heart, pouring\ninto the fathomless dark, has it any name? When in that midnight, standing\nunder the silent stars, I looked upon that figure, my mind was struck with\nawe, and I said to myself: "Who am I to judge her?" O life, O death, O God of\nthe infinite existence, I bow my head in silence to the mystery which is in\nyou.\n\nOnce I thought I should turn back. But I could not. I sat down on the ground\nnear Bimala and placed my hand on her head. At the first touch her whole body\nseemed to stiffen, but the next moment the hardness gave way, and the tears\nburst out. I gently passed my fingers over her forehead. Suddenly her hands\ngroping for my feet grasped them and drew them to herself, pressing them\nagainst her breast with such force that I thought her heart would break.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XVIII](hw41.htm)\n\n'
