He who knows it knows the\nVedas. Upwards and downwards extend its branches, which are enlarged by the\nqualities, and the sprouts of which are sensuous objects. And downwards to\nthis human world are continued its roots which lead on to action. Its form is\nnot thus known here, nor (its) end, nor beginning, nor support. But having\nwith the firm weapon of unconcern, cut this A _s_ vattha, whose roots are\nfirmly fixed, then should one seek for that seat from which those that go\nthere never return, (thinking) that one rests on that same primal being from\nwhom the ancient course (of worldly life) emanated. Those who are free from\npride and delusion, who have overcome the evils of attachment, who are\nconstant in (contemplating) the relation of the supreme and individual self,\nfrom whom desire has departed, who are free from the pairs (of opposites)\ncalled pleasure and pain, go undeluded to that imperishable seat 2. The\n\np. 112\n\nsun does not light it, nor the moon, nor fire 1. That is my highest abode,\ngoing to which none returns. An eternal portion of me it is, which, becoming\nan individual soul in the mortal world, draws (to itself) the senses with the\nmind as the sixth 2. Whenever the ruler (of the bodily frame) obtains or quits\na body, he goes taking these (with him) as the wind (takes) perfumes from\n(their) seats 3. And presiding over the senses of hearing and seeing, and\ntouch, and taste, and smell, and the mind, he enjoys sensuous objects. Those\nwho are deluded do not see (him) remaining in or quitting (a body), enjoying\nor joined to the qualities 4; they see, who have eyes of knowledge. Devotees\nmaking efforts perceive him abiding within their selfs 5. But those whose\nselfs have not been refined, and who have no discernment, do not perceive him\neven (after) making efforts. Know that glory (to be) mine which, dwelling in\nthe sun, lights up the whole world, or in the moon or fire 6.\n\np. 113\n\n[paragraph continues] Entering the earth 1, I by my power support all things;\nand becoming the juicy moon, I nourish all herbs. I becoming the fire, and\ndwelling in the bodies of (all) creatures, and united with the upward and\ndownward life-breaths, cause digestion of the fourfold food 2. And I am placed\nin the heart of all 3; from me (come) memory, knowledge, and their removal; I\nalone am to be learnt from all the Vedas; I am the author of the Vedantas 4;\nand I alone know the Vedas. There are these two beings in the world, the\ndestructible and the indestructible 5. The destructible (includes) all things.\nThe unconcerned one is (what is) called the indestructible. But the being\nsupreme is yet another, called the highest self, who as the inexhaustible\nlord, pervading the three worlds, supports (them). And since I transcend the\ndestructible, and since I am higher also than the indestructible 6, therefore\n\np. 114\n\nam I celebrated in the world and in the Vedas as the best of beings. He who,\nundeluded, thus knows me the best of beings, worships me every way\n[1](sbe0818.htm#fn_481), O descendant of Bharata! knowing everything. Thus, O\nsinless one! have I proclaimed this most mysterious science. He who knows\nthis, has done all he need do, and he becomes possessed of discernment.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[111:1](sbe0817.htm#fr_468) Cf. Ka _th_ opanishad, p. 70, and Sutta Nipata, p.\n76.\n\n[111:2](sbe0817.htm#fr_469) A _s_ vattha stands here for the course of worldly\nlife. Its roots are above, viz. the supreme being; its boughs are Hira _n_\nyagarbha and others of the higher beings. The Vedas are its leaves, preserving\nit as leaves preserve trees (another interpretation is that they are the\ncauses of the fruit which the tree bears, i. e. salvation, &c.) Upwards and\ndownwards, from the highest to the lowest of created things. Enlarged = the\nqualities manifesting themselves, as body, senses, &c.; objects of sense are\nsprouts as they are attached to the senses, which are the tips of the branches\nabove stated. The roots which extend downwards are the desires for various p.\n112 enjoyments. Its form not thus known here, i.e. to those who live and move\nin this world, thus viz. as above described. The man who knows the tree thus\nis said to know the Vedas, because knowledge of it is knowledge of the\nsubstance of the Vedas, which is, that the course of worldly life springs from\nthe supreme, is kept up by Vedic rites, and destroyed by knowledge of the\nsupreme. As to freedom from pride, cf. Sutta Nipata, p. 4.\n\n[112:1](sbe0817.htm#fr_470) Cf. Ka _th_ opanishad, p. 142; Mu _nd_ aka, p.\n304; N _ri_ si _m_ hatapini, p. 106; _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 110.\n\n[112:2](sbe0817.htm#fr_471) Five senses and the mind issue from nature, in\nwhich they are absorbed during sleep or at a dissolution of the world. Cf.\nSutta Nipata, p. 44.\n\n[112:3](sbe0817.htm#fr_472) Cf. Kaushitaki-upanishad, pp. 86, 87.\n\n[112:4](sbe0817.htm#fr_473) Perceiving objects of sense, or feeling pleasure,\npain, &c.\n\n[112:5](sbe0817.htm#fr_474) 'Selfs' = bodies, Ramanu _g_ a and _S_ ridhara;\n'understandings,' _S_ a _n_ kara. In the next sentence 'self' means mind.\n\n[112:6](sbe0817.htm#fr_475) Cf. Maitri-upanishad, p. 142. This sentence\ncontinues what has been stated at the top of the page. The intervening p. 113\nportion explains how souls do come back in some cases. As a general rule, 'all\ngoing ends in returning.' But the soul is an exception in some cases, as the\n'going' to the Brahman is going to the fountain-head. Then the question\narises, How does the severance come off at all? And that is what the lines up\nto this explain.\n\n[113:1](sbe0817.htm#fr_476) 'Entering in the form of the goddess earth,' say\n\xc3\x82nandagiri and Madhusudana. Support, i. e. by keeping the earth from falling\nor crumbling away. The moon is said to nourish herbs by communicating to them\nsome of her 'juice.' The moon, it may be noted, is called 'watery star' by\nShakespeare. As to her relation to the vegetable kingdom, see Matsya-pura _n_\na XXIII, stanza 10 seq.\n\n[113:2](sbe0817.htm#fr_477) I. e. what is drunk, what is licked, what is\npowdered with the teeth, and what is eaten without such powdering.\n\n[113:3](sbe0817.htm#fr_478) Cf. [p. 104](sbe0815.htm#page_104) supra.\n\n[113:4](sbe0817.htm#fr_479) See Introduction, [p. 17](sbe0802.htm#page_17).\n\n[113:5](sbe0817.htm#fr_480) Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 294.\n\n[113:6](sbe0817.htm#fr_481) The two are the whole collection of things as they\nappear and their material cause. The supreme being is a third principle.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chaper XVI](sbe0818.htm)\n\n"
