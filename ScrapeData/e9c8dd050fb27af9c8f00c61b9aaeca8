Give thy consent!\'\n\n2\\. To the west with (the words), \'Anumati! Give thy consent!\'\n\n3\\. To the north with (the words), \'Sarasvati! Give thy consent!\'\n\n4\\. With (the words), \'God Savit _ri_! Give thy impulse!\' (Mantra-Brahma _n_ a\nI, 1, 1) he should sprinkle (water) round the fire once or thrice so as to\nkeep his right side turned towards it\xc2\x97\n\n5\\. Interchanging the points at which he begins and ends the (sprinkling of\nwater), and sprinkling so as to encompass what he is going to offer (with the\nstreams of water).\n\n6. 6 Let him then make oblations of the sacrificial food, be it prepared or raw, over the fire.\n\np. 20\n\n7. 7 If it is raw, he should sacrifice after having washed it and having let the water drop off.\n\n8\\. If it consists in curds or milk or rice gruel, (he should sacrifice it)\nwith a brazen bowl, or with the pot in which the oblations of boiled rice are\nprepared, or also with the (sacrificial spoon called) Sruva;\n\n9. 9  10 In the evening the first (oblation) with (the formula), \'To Agni Svaha!\' the second silently, in the middle and in the north-eastern part (of the fire);\n\n10\\. In the morning the first (oblation) with (the formula), \'To Surya Svaha!\'\nthe second again silently, again in the middle and in the north-eastern part\n(of the fire).\n\n11\\. Having put a piece of wood (on the fire), and having again sprinkled\n(water) round it, he should pour out again his joined hands full of water in\nthe same way (as prescribed in the Sutras 1-3); in the Mantras he says, \'Thou\nhast given thy consent\' (instead of \'Give thy consent\').\n\n12. 12 Having circumambulated the fire so as to turn his right side towards it, having poured out the remains of water, and filled the vessel again, and put it (in its proper place), (he may do) whatever his business is.\n\np. 21\n\n13. 13 In that way, from that time (in which he has begun to offer the two daily sacrifices) he should sacrifice, or should have sacrificed, over the (sacred) domestic fire, till the end of his life.\n\n14\\. Here now they say:\n\n15. 15 \'If they like, his wife may offer the morning and evening oblations over the domestic fire. For his wife is (as it were) his house, and that fire is the domestic fire.\'\n\n16. 16 When the morning meal or the evening meal is ready, he should make (his wife) say, \'It is ready!\'\xc2\x97\n\n17\\. In an unbroken voice (?), having made himself pure,\n\n18. 18 He replies in a loud voice, \'Om!\' Then in\n\np. 22\n\na low voice: \'To that (food) I bring adoration. May it not fail!\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[19:3](sbe30006.htm#fr_115) Rules regarding the daily morning and evening\nsacrifice.\n\n[19:1](sbe30006.htm#fr_116) 1-5. Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 2, 17-21.\n\n[19:6](sbe30006.htm#fr_117) The sacrificial food is either k _ri_ ta\n(prepared) or ak _ri_ ta (unprepared). A mess of boiled rice, for instance, is\nk _ri_ ta, rice grains are ak _ri_ ta.\n\n[20:7](sbe30006.htm#fr_118) 7-12. Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 5, 10-12. Prodaka in\nSutra 7 is explained by pragatodaka.\n\n[20:10](sbe30006.htm#fr_120) 9-10. Khadira-G _ri_ hya, l.l. 13-15.\n\n[20:9](sbe30006.htm#fr_119) The first oblation is made in the middle, the\nsecond, sacred to Pra _g_ apati ( _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 3, 15, &c.), in the north-\neastern part of the sacred fire. The tenth Sutra of course is to be understood\nin the same way.\n\n[20:12](sbe30006.htm#fr_121) The water is that mentioned chap. 1, 24. With\nregard to p. 21 yathartham the commentary says, \'yathartha _m_\nkarmapavargavihita _m_ Vamadevyaganadika _m_ pratarahutipa _s_ _k_ advihita\n_m_ brahmaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _m_ va kuryad iti vakya _s_ esha _h_.\' Similarly in the\nnote on II, 4, 11 it is said, \'yathartham iti karma _n_ a _h_ parisamaptir u\n_k_ yate;\' II, 8, 17: \'yathartha _m_ tantrasamapana _m_ kuryat,\' &c. In my\ntranslation I have adopted the opinion of Professor Weber (Indische Studien,\nV, 375), according to whom yathartham simply means, \'(he should behave) as\nrequired by circumstances;\' \'(he should do) what happens to be his business.\'\n\n[21:13](sbe30006.htm#fr_122) The last words are a _g_ ivitavabh _ri_ that,\nwhich literally means \'till the Avabh _ri_ tha bath of his life.\' The Avabh\n_ri_ tha bath is the bath taken at the end of certain sacrifices, so that the\nAvabh _ri_ tha of life signifies death.\n\n[21:15](sbe30006.htm#fr_123) Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 5, 17.\n\n[21:16](sbe30006.htm#fr_124) 16-18. Khadira-G _ri_ hya, l.l. 18, 19. In my\ntranslation of Sutra 17 I have adopted, though not quite without doubt, the\nconjecture of Professor Roth given in Professor Knauer\'s note, p. 137.\nProfessor Roth writes _ri_ tebha\xe1\xb9\x85gaya va _k_ a or _ri_ tebhagaya va _k_ a: he\nsays simply \'om,\' and not \'o-o-o-o-o-om.\' According to the commentary Sutra 17\nwould refer to the wife, not to the husband.\n\n[21:18](sbe30006.htm#fr_125) The MSS. give makhya and maksha. We ought to\nread, tan ma kshayity upa _m_ _s_ u. Comp. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 3, 11\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4](sbe30007.htm)\n\n'
