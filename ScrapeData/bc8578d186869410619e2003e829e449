Huri replied, "Bring\nhim immediately." On Krishnu uttering these words the door-keepers ushered the\nbrahmin quickly into his presence; and, on seeing him, Shree Krishnu Chund\ndescended from his throne, and, having made an obeisance, and advancing and\ntaking him by the hand, brought him into the palace, and having seated him by\nhis side on the jewelled throne, thus addressed him, "Say, O divinity! whence\nand for what purpose hast thou come?" The brahmin replied, "O sea of\ncompassion and brother of the poor! I have come from the Mugudh country, and\nbring a message from twenty thousand Rajas." Krishnu enquired, "What message?"\nThe brahmin replied, "O great king! the twenty thousand Rajas, whom\nJoorasindhoo has forcibly confined, putting handcuffs and leg-irons upon them,\nhave, with the utmost submissiveness, sent this message by me to you. O lord\nof the poor! this is your custom that whenever demons vex your worshippers you\ndescend upon the earth and afford them protection. O lord! in the same manner,\nthat you released Purhlad from Hirunkusyp, and an elephant from the shark, be\npleased, compassionately, to release us also now from this great affliction;\nwe are in grievous trouble; and, with exception of you, no one has power to\nrescue and deliver us from this heavy calamity."\n\nO great king! on hearing these words, Krishnu being mercifully disposed\ntowards them, said to the brahmin, "O divinity! do not suffer anxiety any more\non their account, it shall now be my office to remove their afflictions." The\n\np. 355\n\nbrahmin was gratified by this speech of Shree Krishnu Chund\'s, and began to\ngive him a blessing. In the mean while Narud Jee made his appearance there,\nand Shree Krishnu Chund, having made a salutation to him, enquired, "Narud\nJee! you go and come every where, tell me how are Joodisthur and the other\nPandoos, my five brothers, getting on now-a-days, and what are they about? It\nis long since I heard any thing about them; and for this reason my thoughts\nare occupied with them." Narud Jee replied, "O great king! I am just come from\nthem, they are quite well, but are much, and anxiously occupied in making\npreparations for a royal sacrifice, and are saying repeatedly, \'Without Shree\nKrishnu Chund\'s assistance, our sacrifice will not be complete.\' For this\nreason, O great king! be pleased to adopt my suggestion, and first make\narrangements for their sacrifice, and afterwards proceed elsewhere."\n\nO great king! on hearing this speech of Narud Jee\'s, Krishnu sent for Oodho\nJee, and said to him, "Oodho! you are my friend, never absent from my mind or\nsight, there is an immense crowd at both places; to which will you go first O\nbrave warrior? so many Rajas, suffering grievous misfortune, are expecting my\napproach and here the Pandoos have prepared a sacrifice." Thus did Krishnu\naddress Oodho.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXII](psa73.htm)\n\n'
