Or on the day which follows after that.\n\n3\\. To the south-east (of the house), in the intermediate direction (between\nsouth and east), they partition off (a place with mats or the like).\n\n4\\. The long-side (of that place should lie) in the same (direction).\n\n5\\. They should perform (the ceremonies) turning their faces towards the same\n(direction).\n\n6\\. (It should measure) at least four prakramas (i.e. steps).\n\n7\\. (It should have) its entrance from the west.\n\n8. 8 In the northern part of that enclosure they make the Laksha _n_ a and carry the fire (to that place).\n\n9\\. To the west of the fire he places a mortar so that it stands firmly, and\nhusks, holding his left hand uppermost, one handful of rice-grains which he\nhas seized with one grasp.\n\np. 104\n\n10\\. When (the rice) has been husked,\n\n11\\. He should once carefully remove the husks.\n\n12. 12 And then he should cut off a lump of flesh from that thigh and should cut it in small pieces on a new slaughtering-bench,\n\n13\\. (With the intention) that the Pi _n_ _d_ as (or lumps of food offered to\nthe Manes) should be thoroughly mixed up with flesh.\n\n14. 14 On the same fire he cooks one mess of rice-grains and one of meat, stirring up the one and the other separately, from right to left, with the two pot-ladles.\n\n15. 15 After he has cooked them, he should pour (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on them, should take them from the fire towards the south, and should not pour (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on them again.\n\n16\\. In the southern part of the enclosure (Sutras 3 seq.) he should have\nthree pits dug, so that the eastern (pit is dug) first,\n\n17\\. One span in length, four inches in breadth and in depth.\n\n18. 18 Having made the Laksha _n_ a to the east of the eastern pit, they carry the fire (to that place).\n\n19\\. Having carried the fire round the pits on their west side, he should put\nit down on the Laksha _n_ a.\n\n20\\. He strews (round the fire) one handful of Darbha grass which he has cut\noff in one portion.\n\np. 105\n\n21\\. And (he strews it into) the pits,\n\n22\\. Beginning with the eastern (pit).\n\n23\\. To the west of the pits he should have a layer spread out,\n\n24\\. Of southward-pointed Ku _s_ a grass,\n\n25\\. Inclined towards the south.\n\n26\\. And he should put a mat on it.\n\n27. 27 To that (layer of grass) they fetch for him (the following sacrificial implements), one by one, from right to left:\n\n28\\. The two pots in which sacrificial food has been cooked (Sutra 14), the\ntwo pot-ladles (Sutra 14), one brazen vessel, one Darvi (spoon), and water.\n\n29. 29 (The sacrificer's) wife places a stone on the Barhis and pounds (on that stone the fragrant substance called) Sthagara.\n\n30. 30 And on the same (stone) she grinds some collyrium, and anoints therewith three Darbha blades, including the interstices (between the single blades?).\n\n31. 31 He should also get some oil made from sesamum seeds,\n\n32. 32 And a piece of linen tape.\n\n33. 33 After he has invited an odd number of blameless Brahma _n_ as, whose faces should be turned towards the north, to sit down on a pure spot,\n\np. 106\n\n34. 34 And has given them Darbha grass (in order that they may sit down thereon),\n\n35. 35 He gives them (pure) water and afterwards sesamum-water, pronouncing his father's name, 'N.N.! To thee this sesamum-water, and to those who follow thee here, and to those whom thou followest. To thee Svadha!'\n\n36. 36 After he has touched water, (he does) the same for the other two.\n\n37. 37 In the same way (he gives them) perfumes.\n\n38. 38 The words in which he addresses (the Brahma _n_ as) when going to sacrifice, are, 'I shall offer it into the fire.'\n\n39\\. After they have replied, 'Offer it,' he should cut off (the prescribed\nportions) from the two messes of cooked food (Sutra 14), (and should put those\nportions) into the brazen vessel. He then should sacrifice, picking out\n(portions of the Havis) with the pot-ladle, the first (oblation) with (the\nwords), 'Svaha to Soma Pit _ri_ mat,' the second with (the words), 'Svaha to\nAgni Kavyavahana' (MB. II, 3, 1. 2).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[103:1](sbe30034.htm#fr_356) 2, 1 seq.
