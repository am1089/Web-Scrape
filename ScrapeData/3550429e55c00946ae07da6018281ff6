Fare thee well."  \nHer blessing thus Sumitra gave  \nTo him whose soul to Rama clave,  \nExclaiming, when her speech was done,  \n\' Go forth, O Lakshman, go, my son.  \nGo forth, my son to win success,  \nHigh victory and happiness.  \nGo forth thy foemen to destroy,  \nAnd turn again at last with joy.\'  \n  As Matali his charioteer  \nSpeaks for the Lord of Gods to hear,  \nSumantra, palm to palm applied,  \nIn reverence trained, to Rama cried:  \n\'O famous Prince, my car ascend,--  \nMay blessings on thy course attend,--  \nAnd swiftly shall my horses flee  \nAnd place thee where thou biddest me.  \nThe fourteen years thou hast to stay  \nFar in the wilds, begin to-day;  \nFor Oueen Kaikeyi cries, Away."  \n   Then Sita, best of womankind,  \nAscended, with a tranquil mind,  \nSoon as her toilet task was done,  \nThat chariot brilliant as the sun.  \nRama and Lakshman true and bold  \nSprang on the car adorned with gold.  \nThe king those years had counted o\'er,  \nAnd given Sita robes and store  \nOf precious ornaments to wear  \nWhen following her husband there.  \nThe brothers in the car found place  \nFor nets and weapons of the chase,  \nThere warlike arms and mail they laid,  \nA leathern basket and a spade.  \nSoon as Sumantra saw the three  \nWere seated in the chariot, he  \nUrged on each horse of noble breed,  \nWho matched the rushing wind in speed.  \nAs thus the son of Raghu went  \n\nForth for his dreary banishment,  \nChill numbing grief the town assailed,  \nAll strength grew weak, all spirit failed,  \nAyodha through her wide extent  \nWas filled with tumult and lament:  \nSteeds neighed and shook the bells they bore,  \nEach elephant returned a roar.  \nThen all the city, young and old,  \nWild with their sorrow uncontrolled,  \nRushed to the car, as, from the sun  \nThe panting herds to water run.  \nBefore the car, behind, they clung,  \nAnd there as eagerly they hung,  \nWith torrents streaming from their eyes,  \nCalled loudly with repeated cries:  \n\'Listen, Sumantra: draw thy rein;  \nDrive gently, and thy steeds restrain.  \nOnce more on Rama will we gaze,  \nNow to be lost for many days.  \nThe queen his mother has, be sure,  \nA heart of iron, to endure  \nTo see her godlike Rama go,  \nNor feel it shattered by the blow.  \nSita, well done! Videha\'s pride,  \nStill like his shadow by his side;  \nRejoicing in thy duty still  \nAs sunlight cleaves to Meru\'s hill.  \nThou, Lakshman, too, hast well deserved,  \nWho from thy duty hast not swerved,  \nTending the peer of Gods above,  \nWhose lips speak naught but words of love.  \nThy firm resolve is nobly great,  \nAnd high success on thee shall wait.  \nYea, thou shalt win a priceless meed--  \nThy path with him to heaven shall lead,\'  \nAs thus they spake, they could not hold  \nThe tears that down their faces rolled,  \nWhile still they followed for a space  \nTheir darling of Ikshvaku\'s race.  \n   There stood surrounded by a ring  \nOf mournful wives the mournful king;  \nFor, \'I will see once more,\' he cried,  \n\'Mine own dear son,\' and forth he hied.  \nAs he came near, there rose the sound  \nOf weeping, as the dames stood round.  \nSo the she-elephants complain  \nWhen their great lord and guide is slain.  \nKakutstha\'s son, the king of men,  \nThe glorious sire, looked troubled then,  \nAs the full moon is when dismayed  \nBy dark eclipse\'s threatening shade.  \nThen Das\'aratha\'s son, designed  \nFor highest fate of lofty mind.  \nUrged to more speed the charioteer,  \n\'Away, away! why linger here?  \nUrge on thy horses,\' Rama cried,  \nAnd \'Stay, O stay,\' the people sighed.  \nSumantra, urged to speed away,  \nThe townsmen\'s call must disobey,  \nForth as the long-armed hero went,  \n\np. 143  \n\nThe dust his chariot wheels up sent  \nWas laid by streams that ever flowed  \nFrom their sad eyes who filled the road.  \nThen, sprung of woe, from eyes of all  \nThe women drops began to fall,  \nAs from each lotus on the lake  \nThe darting fish the water shake.  \nWhen he, the king of high renown,  \nSaw that one thought held all the town,  \nLike some tall tree he fell and lay,  \nWhose root the axe has hewn away.  \nThen straight a mighty cry from those  \nWho followed Rama\'s car arose,  \nWho saw their monarch fainting there  \nBeneath that grief too great to bear.  \nThen \'Rama, Rama!" with the cry  \nOf \'Ah, his mother!\' sounded high,  \nAs all the people wept aloud  \nAround the ladies\' sorrowing crowd.  \nWhen Rama backward turned his eye,  \nAnd saw the king his father lie  \nWith troubled sense and failing limb,  \nAnd the sad queen, who followed him,  \nLike some young creature in the net,  \nThat will not, in its misery, let  \nIts wild eyes on its mother rest,  \nSo, by the bonds of duty pressed,  \nHis mother\'s look he could not meet.  \nHe saw them with their weary feet,  \nWho, used to bliss, in cars should ride,  \nWho ne\'er by sorrow should be tried,  \nAnd, as one mournful look he cast,  \n\'Drive on,\' he cried, \'Sumantra, fast.\'  \nAs when the driver\'s torturing hook  \nGoads on an elephant, the look  \nOf sire and mother in despair  \nWas more than Rama\'s heart could bear.  \nAs mother kine to stalls return  \nWhich hold the calves for whom they yearn,  \nSo to the car she tried to run  \nAs a cow seeks her little one.  \nOnce and again the hero\'s eyes  \nLooked on his mother, as with cries  \nOf woe she called and gestures wild,  \n\'O Sita, Lakshman, O my child!\'  \n\'Stay,\' cried the king, \'thy chariot stay:\'  \n\'On, on,\' cried Rama, \'speed away.\'  \nAs one between two hosts, inclined  \nTo neither was Sumantra\'s mind.  \nBut Rama spake these words again:  \n\'A lengthened woe is bitterest pain.  \nOn, on; and if his wrath grow hot,  \nThine answer be, \' I heard thee not.\'  \nSumantra, at the chief\'s behest,  \nDismissed the crowd that toward him pressed,  \nAnd, as he bade, to swiftest speed  \nUrged on his way each willing steed.  \nThe king\'s attendants parted thence,  \nAnd paid him heart-felt reverence:  \nIn mind, and with the tears he wept,  \nEach still his place near Rama kept.  \nAs swift away the horses sped,  \nHis lords to Das\'aratha said:  \n\'To follow him whom thou again  \nWouldst see returning home is vain.\'  \n   With failing limb and drooping mien  \n     He heard their counsel wise:  \n   Still on their son the king and queen  \n     Kept fast their lingering eyes.
