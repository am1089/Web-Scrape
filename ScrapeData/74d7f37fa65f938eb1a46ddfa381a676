Shree Krishnu Chund constantly dwelt\nin the city of Dwarka, where increase and plenty flourished in the houses of\nall the descendants of Judoo; the men and women were decorated with jewels and\nornaments, and had a lively appearance; they applied scents, sandal and\nperfumes to their bodies; the mahajuns had places cleanly swept and sprinkled\nwith water in the markets, roads and cross-roads, where traders of different\ncountries brought all kinds of articles of merchandize for sale. Here and\nthere the inhabitants of the city amused themselves. In different places\nbrahmins read the Vedas, and in every house persons recited the Pooranus; holy\nand virtuous men sung, the praises of Huri during the eight watches.\nCharioteers brought chariots, horses and bullocks, harnessed to the royal\ngate. Brave, bold, resolute, powerful descendants of Judoo in chariots and\ncarriages, and mounted on elephants and horses came to pay their respects to\nthe Raja. Persons of skill amused him by dancing, singing and playing upon\nmusical instruments. Bards and panegyrists received elephants, horses,\ndresses, arms, grain, money and golden ornaments, studded with jewels, for\ncelebrating his renown.\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja, O great king!\nwhilst Raja Oogursen engaged\n\np. 439\n\nthus in various diversions in the metropolis of his empire, Shree Krishnu\nChund, the root of joy, constantly amused himself with his sixteen thousand\none hundred and eight wives. Sometimes the wives being overcome by their\npassion, made a figure in the likeness of Krishnu; and sometimes Huri,\npowerless from love, dressed his wives; and the sports and diversions they\ncarried on together cannot be described. I cannot speak of them, they required\nto be seen. Shookdeo Jee after this said,--O great king! one night Shree\nKrishnu Chund was amusing himself with his women, when the celestial musicians\nand choristers, having beheld the various pastimes and diversions of Krishnu,\nplayed upon lutes, timbrels, pipes and kettle-drums, and sang of his excellent\nattributes; there was an harmonious concert, when, upon a thought occurring to\nKrishnu, whilst engaged in diversion, he took them all with him, and went to\nthe banks of a tank, and going into the water began to sport and carry on\npastimes in it; after this, his wives, whilst thus amusing themselves in the\nwater, were overjoyed with love for Krishnu, and forgetting every thing, said,\non seeing a ruddy goose and its mate, calling out to each other from opposite\nsides of the tank, "O Chukwee! why do you call out mournfully, and not sleep\nduring the night, whilst separated from your mate? You call upon him in a very\ntroubled and restless manner, you discourse of your beloved to us, we have\nbecome Krishnu\'s slave girls." Having thus spoken they went on. They then\nbegan to say to the sea, O sea! thou who heavest deep sighs and remainest\nawake day and night, art thou afflicted at being separated from any one or\ngrieved for the loss of thy fourteen jewels?" They then addressed the moon, "O\nmoon! why dost thou continue emaciated and in low spirits, what! hast thou\nconsumption, that thy form . diminishes and increases daily, and thy body and\nmind are fascinated, as ours are on beholding Shree Krishnu Chund."\n\np. 440\n\nHaving recited thus much Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja,--O great king!\nthe women, in like manner, addressed all kinds of speeches to the air, clouds,\ncuckoos, hills, rivers and geese. Afterwards all his wives diverted themselves\nwith Shree Krishnu Chund, and constantly attended upon him and sang of his\nexcellences, and obtained whatever they desired and Krishnu carried on his\ndomestic affairs in the manner prescribed for all virtuous house-keeper.\n\nO great king! the sixteen thousand one hundred and eight wives of Shree\nKrishnu Chund whom I mentioned before, had each ten sons and one daughter, and\ntheir progeny was numberless, I have not the power to describe it; but I know\nso much, that there were three crores, eighty-eight thousand one hundred\nschools for instructing the offspring of Shree Krishnu Chund and the same\nnumber of schoolmasters. None of Shree Krishnu Chund\'s sons or grandsons was\ndeficient in beauty, strength, physical power, wealth or moral and religious\nmerit, each one excelled and surpassed the other, how shall I attempt to\ndescribe them. The sage proceeded to say, O great king! I have sung of the\ngames of Bruj and Dwarka, which confer pleasure upon all. Whoever shall sing\nof them with affection, shall undoubtedly obtain supreme and eternal\nhappiness, and salvation. Whatever benefit is derived from, religious penance,\nsacrifice, gifts, fasting, pilgrimage and bathing at holy places, the same\nbenefit is derived from hearing, and reciting the history of Huri.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END.\n\nW.
