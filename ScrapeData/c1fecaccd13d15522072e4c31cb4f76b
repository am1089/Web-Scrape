But with a view to the efforts made (by the soul) (the Lord makes it\nact), on account of the (otherwise resulting) purportlessness of the\ninjunctions and prohibitions, &c.\n\nThe word 'but' removes the objections started.--The Lord makes the soul act,\nhaving regard to the efforts made by it, whether meritorious or non--\nmeritorious. Hence\n\np. 60\n\nthere is no room for the objections raised. Having regard to the inequality of\nthe virtuous and vicious actions of the souls, the Lord, acting as a mere\noccasional cause, allots to them corresponding unequal results. An analogous\ncase is furnished by rain. As rain constitutes the common occasional cause for\nshrubs, bushes, corn, and so on, which belong to different species and spring\neach from its particular seed--for the inequality of their sap, flowers,\nfruits, and leaves results neither when rain is absent nor when the special\nseeds are absent--; so we also must assume that the Lord arranges favourable\nor unfavourable circumstances for the souls with a view to their former\nefforts.--But if the activity of the soul is dependent on something else, this\nhaving regard (on the part of the Lord) to former effort is inappropriate.--By\nno means, we reply: for although the activity of the soul is not independent,\nyet the soul does act. The Lord indeed causes it to act, but it acts itself.\nMoreover, the Lord in causing it to act now has regard to its former efforts,\nand he caused it to act in a former existence, having regard to its efforts\nprevious to that existence; a regressus against which, considering the\neternity of the sa _m_ sara, no objections can be raised.--But how is it known\nthat the Lord has regard to the efforts made (in former existences)?--The\nSutra replies: from the purportlessness, &c., of injunctions and prohibitions.\nFor thus (i.e. if the Lord has regard to former actions) injunctions such as\n'he who is desirous of the heavenly world is to sacrifice,' and prohibitions\nsuch as a Brahma _n_ a must not be killed,' are not devoid of purport. On the\nother alternative they would be without purport, and the Lord would in fact be\nenjoined in the place of injunctions and prohibitions 1, since the soul would\nbe absolutely dependent. And then the Lord might requite with good those who\nact according to the injunctions, and with evil men doing what is forbidden;\nwhich would\n\np. 61\n\nsubvert the authoritativeness of the Veda. Moreover, if the Lord were\nabsolutely without any regard, it would follow that also the ordinary efforts\nof men are without any purport; and so likewise the special conditions of\nplace, time, and cause. And also the difficulty mentioned above 1 would\npresent itself.--All these latter difficulties the Sutrakara comprises in his\n'&c.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[60:1](sbe38043.htm#fr_40) \xc3\x8e _s_ vara eva vidhinishedhayo _h_ sthane niyu _g_\nyeta yad vidhinishedhayo _h_ phala _m_ tad i _s_ vare _n_ a\ntatpratipaditadharmadharmanirapekshe _n_ a k _ri_ tam iti.
