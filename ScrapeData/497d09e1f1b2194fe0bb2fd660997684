If it be said that some (mention) that which rests on Inference; we deny\nthis because (the form) refers to what is contained in the simile of the body;\nand (this the text) shows.\n\nSo far the Sutras have given instruction about a Brahman, the enquiry into\nwhich serves as a means to obtain what is the highest good of man, viz. final\nrelease; which is the cause of the origination, and so on, of the world; which\ndiffers in nature from all non-sentient things such as the Pradhana, and from\nall intelligent beings whether in the state of bondage or of release; which is\nfree from all shadow of imperfection; which is all knowing, all powerful, has\nthe power of realising all its purposes, comprises within itself all blessed\nqualities, is the inner Self of all, and possesses unbounded power and might.\nBut here a new special objection presents itself. In order to establish the\ntheory maintained by Kapila, viz. of there being a Pradhana and individual\nsouls which do _not_ have their Self in Brahman, it is pointed out by some\nthat in certain branches of the Veda there are met with certain passages which\nappear to adumbrate the doctrine of the Pradhana being the universal cause.\nThe Sutras now apply themselves to the refutation of this view, in order\nthereby to confirm the theory of Brahman being the only cause of all.\n\nWe read in the Ka _th_ a-Upanishad, 'Beyond the senses there are the objects,\nbeyond the objects there is the mind, beyond the mind there is the intellect,\nthe great Self is beyond the intellect. Beyond the Great there is the\nUnevolved, beyond the Unevolved there is the Person. Beyond the Person there\nis nothing--this is the goal, the highest road' (Ka. Up. I, 3, 11). The\nquestion here arises whether by the 'Unevolved' be or be not meant the\n\np. 355\n\n[paragraph continues] Pradhana, as established by Kapila's theory, of which\nBrahman is not the Self.--The Purvapakshin maintains the former alternative.\nFor, he says, in the clause 'beyond the Great is the Unevolved, beyond the\nUnevolved is the Person,' we recognise the arrangement of entities as\nestablished by the Sa _n_ khya-system, and hence must take the 'Unevolved' to\nbe the Pradhana. This is further confirmed by the additional clause 'beyond\nthe Person there is nothing,' which (in agreement with Sa _n_ khya principles)\ndenies that there is any being beyond the soul, which itself is the twenty-\nfifth and last of the principles recognised by the Sa _n_ khyas. This prima\nfacie view is expressed in the former part of the Sutra, 'If it be said that\nin the _s_ akhas of some that which rests on Inference, i.e. the Pradhana, is\nstated as the universal cause.'\n\nThe latter part of the Sutra refutes this view. The word 'Unevolved' does not\ndenote a Pradhana independent of Brahman; it rather denotes the body\nrepresented as a chariot in the simile of the body, i.e. in the passage\ninstituting a comparison between the Self, body, intellect, and so on, on the\none side, and the charioteer, chariot, &c. on the other side.--The details are\nas follows. The text at first--in the section beginning 'Know the Self to be\nthe person driving,' &c., and ending 'he reaches the end of the journey, and\nthat is the highest place of Vish _n_ u' (I, 3, 3-9)--compares the devotee\ndesirous of reaching the goal of his journey through the sa _m_ sara, i.e. the\nabode of Vish _n_ u, to a man driving in a chariot; and his body, senses, and\nso on, to the chariot and parts of the chariot; the meaning of the whole\ncomparison being that he only reaches the goal who has the chariot, &c. in his\ncontrol. It thereupon proceeds to declare which of the different beings\nenumerated and compared to a chariot, and so on, occupy a superior position to\nthe others in so far, namely, as they are that which requires to be\ncontrolled--'higher than the senses are the objects,' and so on. Higher than\nthe senses compared to the horses--are the objects--compared to roads,--\nbecause even a man who generally controls his senses finds it difficult to\nmaster them when they are in\n\np. 356\n\ncontact with their objects; higher than the objects is the mind-compared to\nthe reins--because when the mind inclines towards the objects even the non-\nproximity of the latter does not make much difference; higher than the mind\n(manas) is the intellect (buddhi)--compared to the charioteer--because in the\nabsence of decision (which is the characteristic quality of buddhi) the mind\nalso has little power; higher than the intellect again is the (individual)\nSelf, for that Self is the agent whom the intellect serves. And as all this is\nsubject to the wishes of the Self, the text characterises it as the 'great\nSelf.' Superior to that Self again is the body, compared to the chariot, for\nall activity whereby the individual Self strives to bring about what is of\nadvantage to itself depends on the body. And higher finally than the body is\nthe highest Person, the inner Ruler and Self of all, the term and goal of the\njourney of the individual soul; for the activities of all the beings\nenumerated depend on the wishes of that highest Self. As the universal inner\nRuler that Self brings about the meditation of the Devotee also; for the Sutra\n(II, 3, 41) expressly declares that the activity of the individual soul\ndepends on the Supreme Person. Being the means for bringing about the\nmeditation and the goal of meditation, that same Self is the highest object to\nbe attained; hence the text says 'Higher than the Person there is nothing--\nthat is the goal, the highest road.' Analogously scripture, in the antaryamin-\nBrahma _n_ a, at first declares that the highest Self within witnesses and\nrules everything, and thereupon negatives the existence of any further ruling\nprinciple 'There is no other seer but he,' &c. Similarly, in the Bhagavad-\ngita, 'The abode, the agent, the various senses, the different and manifold\nfunctions, and fifth the Divinity (i.e. the highest Person)' (XVIII, 14); and\n'I dwell within the heart of all; memory and perception, as well as their\nloss, come from me' (XV, 15). And if, as in the explanation of the text under\ndiscussion, we speak of that highest Self being 'controlled,' we must\nunderstand thereby the soul's taking refuge with it; compare the passage Bha.\nGi. XVIII, 61-62, 'The Lord\n\np. 357\n\ndwells in the heart of all creatures, whirling them round as if mounted on a\nmachine; to Him go for refuge.'\n\nNow all the beings, senses, and so on, which had been mentioned in the simile,\nare recognised in the passage 'higher than the senses are the objects,' &c.,\nbeing designated there by their proper names; but there is no mention made of\nthe body which previously had been compared to the chariot; we therefore\nconclude that it is the body which is denoted by the term 'the Unevolved.'\nHence there is no reason to see here a reference to the Pradhana as\nestablished in the theory of Kapila. Nor do we recognise, in the text under\ndiscussion, the general system of Kapila. The text declares the objects, i.e.\nsounds and so on, to be superior to the senses; but in Kapila's system the\nobjects are not viewed as the causes of the senses. For the same reason the\nstatement that the manas is higher than the objects does not agree with\nKapila's doctrine. Nor is this the case with regard to the clause 'higher than\nthe buddhi is the great one, the Self; for with Kapila the 'great one' (mahat)\nis the buddhi, and it would not do to say 'higher than the great one is the\ngreat one.' And finally the 'great one,' according to Kapila, cannot be called\nthe 'Self.' The text under discussion thus refers only to those entities which\nhad previously appeared in the simile. The text itself further on proves this,\nwhen saying 'That Self is hidden in all beings and does not shine forth, but\nit is seen by subtle seers through their sharp and subtle intellect. A wise\nman should keep down speech in the mind, he should keep that within knowledge\n(which is) within the Self; he should keep knowledge within the great Self,\nand that he should keep within the quiet Self.' For this passage, after having\nstated that the highest Self is difficult to see with the inner and outer\norgans of knowledge, describes the mode in which the sense-organs, and so on,\nare to be held in control. The wise man should restrain the sense-organs and\nthe organs of activity within the mind; he should restrain that (i.e. the\nmind) within knowledge, i.e. within the intellect (buddhi), which abides\nwithin the Self; he should further restrain the intellect within the\n\np. 358\n\ngreat Self, i.e. the active individual Self; and that Self finally he should\nrestrain within the quiet Self, i.e. the highest Brahman, which is the inner\nruler of all; i.e. he should reach, with his individual Self so qualified, the\nplace of Vish _n_ u, i.e. Brahman.--But how can the term 'the Unevolved'\ndenote the evolved body?--To this question the next Sutra furnishes a reply.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
