The highest Brahman\nis very far off 3, and (the attainment of it) depends on Vedic knowledge 4; it\nis free from the pairs of opposites, devoid of qualities 5, everlasting, of\nunthinkable qualities, and supreme. The men of talent, who are pure 6, and\nwhose minds are refined, transcending passion, and being untainted, perceive\nthat supreme (principle) by means of knowledge and penance. Those who are\nconstantly devoted to renunciation 7, and understand the Brahman and wish for\nthe supreme, go to the happy path by penance. Penance 8 is said to be a light;\n(correct) conduct is the means to piety; knowledge verily should be understood\nto be the highest, and renunciation the best penance. He who understands\ndeterminately the self which is unperturbed, which abides in all entities, and\nwhich is the essential\n\np. 370\n\nelement in knowledge, he is laid down 1 (as being able) to move everywhere.\nThe learned man who perceives, association and dissociation, and likewise\nunity and diversity 2, is released from misery. He who desires nothing, and\ndespises nothing 3, becomes eligible, even dwelling in this world, for\nassimilation with the Brahman 4. He who knows the truth about the qualities of\nPradhana 5, and understands the Pradhana of all entities 6, who is free from\n(the thought that this or that is) mine, and free from egoism 7, is\nemancipated, there is no doubt of that. One who is free from the pairs of\nopposites, free from the (ceremonies of) salutation, free from (the ceremony\nof) svadha 8, attains to that everlasting (principle) which is free from the\npairs of opposites, and devoid of qualities, by tranquillity only. Abandoning\nall action, whether agreeable or disagreeable, developed from the qualities 9,\nand abandoning both truth and falsehood 10, a creature is emancipated, there\nis no doubt of that. The great tree of Brahman 11 is\n\np. 371\n\neternal; a tree which is produced from the unperceived as the seed, which\nconsists of the understanding as its trunk, whose collection of boughs is the\ngreat egoism, the sprouts within which are the senses, the great branches of\nwhich are the great elements, and the side branches the objects of sense,\nwhich is always possessed of leaves, always possessed of flowers, in which\nagreeable and disagreeable fruits are always produced, and which is fed upon\nby all creatures. Cutting and piercing this (tree) 1 with the sword of\nknowledge of the truth, and abandoning the bonds in the shape of attachment,\nwhich cause birth, death, and old age 2, a wise man who is free from (the\nthought that this or that is) mine, and who is devoid of egoism, is\nemancipated, there is no doubt of that. There are these two birds 3, (which\nare) unchanging, and which should also be known to be unintelligent 4. But as\nto that other who is above them, he is called intelligent. (When) the inner\nself, devoid of knowledge of nature 5, and (as it were) non-intelligent 6,\nunderstands that which is\n\np. 372\n\nbeyond nature, then understanding the Kshetra [1](sbe0860.htm#fn_1918), and\nwith an understanding comprehending all, and transcending the qualities\n[2](sbe0860.htm#fn_1919) he is released from all sins.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[369:1](sbe0859.htm#fr_1900) Abandoning of fruit, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Cf.\nGita, [p. 121](sbe0819.htm#page_121).\n\n[369:2](sbe0859.htm#fr_1901) Cf. [p. 339](sbe0854.htm#page_339) supra, note\n[4](sbe0854.htm#fn_1654), dwelling in = adhering to.\n\n[369:3](sbe0859.htm#fr_1903) See Gita, [p. 104](sbe0815.htm#page_104).\n\n[369:4](sbe0859.htm#fr_1904) Cf. Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p.\n158](sbe0823.htm#page_158) seq.\n\n[369:5](sbe0859.htm#fr_1905) Viz. the three famous ones.\n\n[369:6](sbe0859.htm#fr_1906) Pure, refined, and untainted are not easily\ndistinguished. Probably 'pure' refers to external cleanliness; untainted, 'to\nfreedom from sin and such taints; and 'refined' to freedom from error.\n\n[369:7](sbe0859.htm#fr_1907) I. e. who have no 'belongings,--'Ar _g_ una 'Mi\n_s_ ra.\n\n[369:8](sbe0859.htm#fr_1908) Action without desire, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, who\nadds that it is called a light, as it leads to knowledge. See too [p.\n166](sbe0824.htm#page_166), and [p. 247](sbe0831.htm#page_247), note\n[11](sbe0831.htm#fn_1166), and [p. 340](sbe0854.htm#page_340) supra.\n\n[370:1](sbe0859.htm#fr_1909) 'Laid down' is literally 'wished.'\n\n[370:2](sbe0859.htm#fr_1910) I presume this means the real fact underlying the\nappearances of association and so forth, namely, that there is but one\nreality, and all appearances of difference &c. are unreal. Cf. Gita, [p.\n124](sbe0820.htm#page_124). See also [p. 313](sbe0847.htm#page_313) supra,\nnote  [1](sbe0847.htm#fn_1495), and [p. 374](sbe0860.htm#page_374) infra.\n\n[370:3](sbe0859.htm#fr_1911) Cf. Gita, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65), and see\nKa _th_ a, p. 155.\n\n[370:4](sbe0859.htm#fr_1912) Cf. Gita, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65).\n\n[370:5](sbe0859.htm#fr_1913) The qualities, viz. the three, of Pradhana, i. e.\nconstituting Prak _ri_ ti, or nature.\n\n[370:6](sbe0859.htm#fr_1914) See Gita, [p. 106](sbe0815.htm#page_106), and\nnote  [3](sbe0816.htm#fn_443) there.\n\n[370:7](sbe0859.htm#fr_1915) For this whole expression which occurs so\nfrequently, cf. Maitri, p. 44, and comment there.\n\n[370:8](sbe0859.htm#fr_1916) See [p. 324](sbe0849.htm#page_324) supra, note\n[8](sbe0849.htm#fn_1569).\n\n[370:9](sbe0859.htm#fr_1917) Cf. Gita, [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48); _S_ veta\n_s_ vatara, p. 360.\n\n[370:10](sbe0859.htm#fr_1918) I. e., I presume, what is real and unreal in a\nworldly view,--the great truth is not to be 'abandoned.' Cf. Taittiriya, p.\n97-99; [p. 191](sbe0826.htm#page_191) supra; _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha), chap.\n174, st. 53; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 21, 13.\n\n[370:11](sbe0859.htm#fr_1919) I. e., says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, the tree of\nworldly life produced from the Brahman. Compare chapter XII supra.\n\n[371:1](sbe0859.htm#fr_1920) Cf. Gita, [p. 111](sbe0817.htm#page_111); and Mu\n_nd_ aka, p. 307, and commentary there.\n\n[371:2](sbe0859.htm#fr_1921) So I render the original, though the sense at\nfirst sight appears to be 'which are caused by birth,' &c.\n\n[371:3](sbe0859.htm#fr_1922) Viz. the understanding and egoism, which dwell in\nthe 'tree,' Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Nilaka _nth_ a says, 'the great and the\nindividual self.'\n\n[371:4](sbe0859.htm#fr_1923) Cf. Sa _n_ khya-karika II, and comment of Va _k_\naspati Mi _s_ ra. The self is not unintelligent; and as the birds are so\ndescribed, they must stand for some manifestation of Prak _ri_ ti, which\nunderstanding and egoism are. Otherwise 'bird' does stand for 'self.' See [p.\n189](sbe0826.htm#page_189) supra.\n\n[371:5](sbe0859.htm#fr_1924) The original word here is sattva, on which see\n[p. 351](sbe0855.htm#page_351) supra. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra renders it here by\nPrak _ri_ ti.\n\n[371:6](sbe0859.htm#fr_1925) So Nilaka _nth_ a; 'the only intelligent\nprinciple,'--Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. On Nilaka _nth_ a's interpretation 'inner\nself' must be the same thing as Bhutatman at Maitri, p. 41.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXIII](sbe0860.htm)\n\n"
