Verily, there are four kinds of fire,--the one laid down, the one\ntaken out, the one taken forward, and the one spread (over the three hearths).\nNow, that which is laid down is this very (terrestrial) world; that which is\ntaken out is the air-world, that which is taken forward is the sky, and that\nwhich is spread is the regions. And that which is laid down is Agni, that\nwhich is taken out is Vayu (the wind), that which is taken forward is \xc3\x82ditya\n(the sun), and that which is spread is _K_ andramas (the moon). And that which\nis laid down is the Garhapatya, that which is taken out is the \xc3\x82havaniya, that\nwhich is taken forward is the (fire) they lead forth eastwards from the\n\xc3\x82havaniya; and that which is spread is the one they take northwards for the\ncooking of the victim, and that (used) for the by-offerings 1: let him\ntherefore perform the animal sacrifice on a fire taken forward.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[127:1](sbe44042.htm#fr_394) See III, 8, 3, 18; 8, 4, 9, with note.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 8, 3.
