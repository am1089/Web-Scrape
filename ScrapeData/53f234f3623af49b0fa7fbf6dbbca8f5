End of the fourth book.\n\nTHE last of the Vrihadratha dynasty, Ripunjaya, will have a minister named\nSunika 1, who having killed his sovereign, will place his son Pradyota upon\nthe throne 2: his son will be Palaka 3; his son will be Vi\xc5\x9bakhayupa 4; his son\nwill be Janaka 5; and his son will be Nandivarddhana 6. These five kings of\nthe house of Pradyota will reign over the earth for a hundred and thirty-eight\nyears 7.\n\nThe next prince will be \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bunaga 8; his son will be Kakavarn\xcc\x81a 9; his son will\nbe Kshemadharman 10; his son will be Kshatraujas 11; his son will be Vidmisara\n12; his son will be \xc3\x81jata\xc5\x9batru 13; his son will be\n\np. 467\n\n[paragraph continues] Dharbaka 14; his son will be Udaya\xc5\x9bwa 15; his son will\nalso be Nandivarddhana; and his son will be Mahanandi 16. These ten \xc5\x9aai\xc5\x9bunagas\nwill be kings of the earth for three hundred and sixty-two years 17.\n\nThe son of Mahananda will be born of a woman of the \xc5\x9audra or servile class;\nhis name will be Nanda, called Mahapadma, for he will be exceedingly\navaricious 18. Like another Para\xc5\x9burama, he will be the annihilator of the\nKshatriya race; for after him the kings of the earth will be \xc5\x9audras. He will\nbring the whole earth under one umbrella: he\n\np. 468\n\nwill have eight sons, Sumalya and others, who will reign after Mahapadma; and\nhe and his sons 19 will govern for a hundred years. The Brahman Kaut\xcc\x81ilya will\nroot out the nine Nandas 20\n\nUpon the cessation of the race of Nanda, the Mauryas will possess the earth,\nfor Kant\xcc\x81ilya will place Chandragupta 21 on the throne: his son\n\np. 469\n\nwill be Vindusara 22; his son will be A\xc5\x9bokavarddhana 23; his son will be\n\np. 470\n\n[paragraph continues] Suya\xc5\x9bas 24; his son will be Da\xc5\x9baratha; his son will be\nSangata; his son will be \xc5\x9aali\xc5\x9buka; his son will be Soma\xc5\x9barmman; his son will\nbe Sa\xc5\x9badharman 25; and his successor will be Vrihadratha. These are the ten\nMauryas, who will reign over the earth for a hundred and thirty-seven years\n26.\n\nThe dynasty of the \xc5\x9aungas will next become possessed of the sovereignty; for\nPushpamitra, the general of the last Maurya prince, will\n\np. 471\n\nput his master to death, and ascend the throne 27: his son will be Agnimitra\n28; his son will be Sujyesht\xcc\x81ha 29; his son will be Vasumitra 30; his son will\nbe \xc3\x81rdraka 31; his son will be Pulindaka 32; his son will be Ghoshavasu 33;\nhis son will be Vajramitra 34; his son will be Bhagavata 35; his son will be\nDevabhuti 36. These are the ten \xc5\x9aungas, who will govern the kingdom for a\nhundred and twelve years 37.\n\nDevabhuti, the last \xc5\x9aunga prince, being addicted to, immoral indulgences, his\nminister, the Kan\xcc\x81wa named Vasudeva will murder him, and usurp the kingdom:\nhis son will be Bhumimitra; his son will be Narayan\xcc\x81a; his son will be\nSu\xc5\x9barman. These four Kan\xcc\x81was will be kings of the earth for forty-five years\n38.\n\np. 472\n\nSu\xc5\x9barman the Kan\xcc\x81wa will be killed by a powerful servant named \xc5\x9aipraka, of the\n\xc3\x81ndhra tribe, who will become king, and found the \xc3\x81ndhrabhritya dynasty 39: he\nwill be succeeded by his brother Krishn\xcc\x81a 40; his son will be \xc5\x9ari \xc5\x9aatakarn\xcc\x81i\n41; his son will be Purnotsanga 42; his son will be \xc5\x9aatakarn\xcc\x81i (2nd) 43; his\nson will be Lambodara 44; his son will be Ivilaka 45; his son will be\nMeghaswati 46; his son will be Patumat 47; his\n\np. 473\n\nson will be Arisht\xcc\x81akarman 48; his son will be Hala 49; his son will be Talaka\n50; his son will be Pravilasena 51; his son will be Sundara, named \xc5\x9aatakarn\xcc\x81i\n52; his son will be Chakora \xc5\x9aatakarn\xcc\x81i 53; his son will be \xc5\x9aivaswati 54; his\nson will be Gomatiputra 55; his son will be Pulimat 56; his son will be\n\xc5\x9aiva\xc5\x9bri \xc5\x9aatakarn\xcc\x81i 57; his son will be \xc5\x9aivaskandha 58; his son will be\nYajna\xc5\x9bri 59; his son will be Vijaya 60; his son will be Chandra\xc5\x9bri 61; his son\nwill be Pulomarchish 62. These thirty Andhrabhritya kings will reign four\nhundred and fifty-six years 63.\n\np. 474\n\nAfter these, various races will reign, as seven \xc3\x81bhiras, ten Garddhabas,\nsixteen \xc5\x9aakas, eight Yavanas, fourteen Tusharas, thirteen Mun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as,\n\np. 475\n\neleven Maunas, altogether seventy-nine princes 64, who will be sovereigns\n\np. 476\n\nof the earth for one thousand three hundred and ninety years; and\n\np. 477\n\nthen eleven Pauras will be kings for three hundred years 65. When they are\ndestroyed, the Kailakila Yavanas will be kings; the chief of whom will be\nVindhya\xc5\x9bakti; his son will be Puranjaya; his son will be Ramachandra; his son\nwill be Adharma, from whom will be Varanga, Kritanandana, \xc5\x9audhinandi,\nNandiya\xc5\x9bas, \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9buka, and Pravira; these will rule for a hundred and six years\n66. From them will proceed thirteen sons;\n\np. 478\n\nthen three Bahlikas, and Pushpamitra, and Pat\xcc\x81umitra, and others, to the\nnumber of thirteen, will rule over Mekala 67. There will be nine\n\np. 479\n\nkings in the seven Koalas, and there will be as many Naishadha princes 68.\n\nIn Magadha a sovereign named Vi\xc5\x9bwasphat\xcc\x81ika will establish other tribes; he\nwill extirpate the Kshatriya or martial race, and elevate fishermen,\nbarbarians, and Brahmans, and other castes, to power 69. The nine Nagas will\nreign in Padmavati, Kantipuri, and Mathura; and the Guptas of Magadha along\nthe Ganges to Prayaga 70. A prince named\n\np. 480\n\n[paragraph continues] Devarakshita will reign, in a city on the sea shore,\nover the Ko\xc5\x9balas, Od\xcc\x81ras, Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ras, and Tamraliptas 71. The Guhas will\npossess Kalinga, Mahihaka, and the mountains of Mahendra 72. The race of\nMan\xcc\x81idhanu will occupy the countries of the Nishadas, Naimishikas, and\nKalatoyas 73.\n\np. 481\n\n[paragraph continues] The people called Kanakas will possess the Amazon\ncountry, and that called Mushika 74. Men of the three tribes, but degraded,\nand \xc3\x81bhiras and \xc5\x9audras, will occupy \xc5\x9aaurasht\xcc\x81ra, Avanti, \xc5\x9aura, Arbuda, and\nMarubhumi: and \xc5\x9audras, outcastes, and barbarians will be masters of the banks\nof the Indus, Darvika, the Chandrabhaga, and Kashmir 75.\n\np. 482\n\nThese will all be contemporary monarchs, reigning over the earth; kings of\nchurlish spirit, violent temper, and ever addicted to falsehood and\nwickedness. They will inflict death on women, children, and cows; they will\nseize upon the property of their subjects; they will be of limited power, and\nwill for the most part rapidly rise and fall; their lives will be short, their\ndesires insatiable, and they will display but little piety. The people of the\nvarious countries intermingling with them will follow their example, and the\nbarbarians being powerful in the patronage of the princes, whilst purer tribes\nare neglected, the people will perish 76. Wealth and piety will decrease day\nby day, until\n\np. 483\n\nthe world will be wholly depraved. Then property alone will confer rank;\nwealth will be the only source of devotion; passion will be the sole bond of\nunion between the sexes; falsehood will be the only means of success in\nlitigation; and women will be objects merely of sensual gratification. Earth\nwill be venerated but for its mineral treasures 77; the Brahmanical thread\nwill constitute a Brahman; external types (as the staff and red garb) will be\nthe only distinctions of the several orders of life; dishonesty will be the\nuniversal means of subsistence; weakness will be the cause of dependance;\nmenace and presumption will be substituted for learning; liberality will be\ndevotion; simple ablution will be purification 78; mutual assent will be\nmarriage; fine clothes will be dignity 79; and water afar off will be esteemed\na holy spring. Amidst all castes he who is the strongest will reign over a\nprincipality thus vitiated by many faults. The people, unable to bear the\nheavy burdens imposed upon them by their avaricious sovereigns, will take\nrefuge amongst the valleys of the mountains, and will be glad to feed upon\nwild honey, herbs, roots, fruits, flowers, and leaves: their only covering\nwill be the bark of trees, and they will be exposed to the cold, and wind, and\nsun, and rain. No man\'s life will exceed three and twenty years. Thus in the\nKali age shall decay constantly proceed, until the human race approaches its\nannihilation.\n\nWhen the practices taught by the Vedas and the institutes of law shall nearly\nhave ceased, and the close of the Kali age shall be nigh, a\n\np. 484\n\nportion of that divine being who exists of his own spiritual nature in the\ncharacter of Brahma, and who is the beginning and the end, and who comprehends\nall things, shall descend upon earth: he will be born in the family of\nVishn\xcc\x81uya\xc5\x9bas, an eminent Brahman of Sambhala village, as Kalki, endowed with\nthe eight superhuman faculties. By his irresistible might he will destroy all\nthe Mlechchhas and thieves, and all whose minds are devoted to iniquity. He\nwill then reestablish righteousness upon earth; and the minds of those who\nlive at the end of the Kali age shall be awakened, and shall be as pellucid as\ncrystal. The men who are thus changed by virtue of that peculiar time shall be\nas the seeds of human beings, and shall give birth to a race who shall follow\nthe laws of the Krita age, or age of purity. As it is said; "When the sun and\nmoon, and the lunar asterism Tishya, and the planet Jupiter, are in one\nmansion, the Krita age shall return 80."\n\nThus, most excellent Muni, the kings who are past, who are present, and who\nare to be, have been enumerated. From the birth of Parikshit to the coronation\nof Nanda it is to be known that 1015 years have elapsed 81. When the two first\nstars of the seven Rishis (the great Bear)\n\np. 485\n\nrise in the heavens, and some lunar asterism is seen at night at an equal\ndistance between them, then the seven Rishis continue stationary in that\nconjunction for a hundred years of men 82. At the birth of\n\np. 486\n\n[paragraph continues] Parikshit they were in Magha, and the Kali age then\ncommenced, which consists of 1200 (divine) years. When the portion of Vishn\xcc\x81u\n(that had been born from Vasudeva) returned to heaven, then the Kali age\ncommenced. As long as the earth was touched by his sacred feet, the Kali age\ncould not affect it. As soon as the incarnation of the eternal Vishn\xcc\x81u had\ndeparted, the son of Dharma, Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira, with his brethren, abdicated the\nsovereignty. Observing unpropitious portents, consequent upon Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s\ndisappearance, he placed Parikshit upon the throne. When the seven Rishis are\nin Purvashad\xcc\x81ha, then Nanda will begin to reign 83, and thenceforward the\ninfluence of the Kali will augment.\n\np. 487\n\nThe day that Krishn\xcc\x81a shall have departed from the earth will be the first of\nthe Kali age, the duration of which you shall hear; it will continue for\n360,000 years of mortals. After twelve hundred divine years shall have\nelapsed, the Krita age shall be renewed.\n\nThus age after age Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vai\xc5\x9byas, and \xc5\x9audras, excellent\nBrahman, men of great souls, have passed away by thousands; whose names and\ntribes and families I have not enumerated to you, from their great number, and\nthe repetition of appellations it would involve. Two persons, Devapi of the\nrace of Puru, and Maru of the family of Ikshwaku, through the force of\ndevotion continue alive throughout the whole four ages, residing at the\nvillage of Kalapa: they will return hither in the beginning of the Krita age,\nand, becoming members of the family of the Manu, give origin to the Kshatriya\ndynasties 84. In this manner the earth is possessed through every series of\nthe three first ages, the Krita, Treta, and Dwapara, by the sons of the Manu;\nand some remain in the Kali age, to serve as the rudiments of renewed\ngenerations, in the same way as Devapi and Maru are still in existence.\n\nI have now given you a summary account of the sovereigns of the earth; to\nrecapitulate the whole would be impossible even in a hundred lives. These and\nother kings, who with perishable frames have possessed this ever-during world,\nand who, blinded with deceptive notions of individual occupation, have\nindulged the feeling that suggests, "This earth is mine--it is my son\'s--it\nbelongs to my dynasty," have all passed away. So, many who reigned before\nthem, many who succeeded them, and many who are yet to come, have ceased, or\nwill cease, to be. Earth laughs, as if smiling with autumnal flowers, to\nbehold her kings unable to effect the subjugation of themselves. I will repeat\nto you, Maitreya, the stanzas that were chanted by Earth, and which the Muni\nAsita communicated to Janaka, whose banner was virtue. "How great is the folly\nof princes, who are endowed with the faculty of reason, to cherish\n\np. 488\n\nthe confidence of ambition, when they themselves are but foam upon the wave.\nBefore they have subdued themselves, they seek to reduce their ministers,\ntheir servants, their subjects, under their authority; they then endeavour to\novercome their foes. \'Thus,\' say they, \'will we conquer the ocean-circled\nearth;\' and, intent upon their project, behold not death, which is not far\noff. But what mighty matter is the subjugation of the sea-girt earth to one\nwho can subdue himself. Emancipation from existence is the fruit of self-\ncontrol. It is through infatuation that kings desire to possess me, whom their\npredecessors have been forced to leave, whom their fathers have not retained.\nBeguiled by the selfish love of sway, fathers contend with sons, and brothers\nwith brothers, for my possession. Foolishness has been the character of every\nking who has boasted, \'All this earth is mine--every thing is mine--it will be\nin my house for ever;\' for he is dead. How is it possible that such vain\ndesires should survive in the hearts of his descendants, who have seen their\nprogenitor, absorbed by the thirst of dominion, compelled to relinquish me,\nwhom he called his own, and tread the path of dissolution? When I hear a king\nsending word to another by his ambassador, \'This earth is mine; immediately\nresign your pretensions to it;\' I am moved to violent laughter at first, but\nit soon subsides in pity for the infatuated fool."\n\nThese were the verses, Maitreya, which Earth recited, and by listening to\nwhich ambition fades away like snow before the sun. I have now related to you\nthe whole account of the descendants of the Manu; amongst whom have flourished\nkings endowed with a portion of Vishn\xcc\x81u, engaged in the preservation of the\nearth. Whoever shall listen reverently and with faith to this narrative,\nproceeding from the posterity of Manu, shall be purified entirely from all his\nsins, and, with the perfect possession of his faculties, shall live in\nunequalled affluence, plenty, and prosperity. He who has heard of the races of\nthe sun and moon, of Ikshwa.ku, Jahnu, Man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81hatri, Sagara, and Raghu, who\nhave all perished; of Yayati, Nahusha, and their posterity, who are no more;\nof kings of great might, resistless valour, and unbounded wealth, who have\nbeen overcome by still more powerful time, and are now only a tale; he will\nlearn wisdom, and forbear to call either children, or wife, or house, or\n\np. 489\n\nlands, or wealth, his own. The arduous penances that have been performed by\nheroic men obstructing fate for countless years, religious rites and\nsacrifices of great efficacy and virtue, have been made by time the subject\nonly of narration. The valiant Prithu traversed the universe, every where\ntriumphant over his foes; yet he was blown away, like the light down of the\nSimal tree, before the blast of time. He who was Kartaviryya subdued\ninnumerable enemies, and conquered the seven zones of the earth; but now he is\nonly the topic of a theme, a subject for affirmation and contradiction 85. Fie\nupon the empire of the sons of Raghu, who triumphed over Da\xc5\x9banana, and\nextended their sway to the ends of the earth; for was it not consumed in an\ninstant by the frown of the destroyer? Man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81hatri, the emperor of the\nuniverse, is embodied only in a legend; and what pious man who hears it will\never be so unwise as to cherish the desire of possession in his soul?\nBhagiratha, Sagara, Kakutstha, Da\xc5\x9banana, Rama, Lakshmana, Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira, and\nothers, have been. Is it so? Have they ever really existed? Where are they\nnow? we know not! The powerful kings who now are, or who will be, as I have\nrelated them to you, or any others who are unspecified, are all subject to the\nsame fate, and the present and the future will perish and be forgotten, like\ntheir predecessors. Aware of this truth, a wise man will never be influenced\nby the principle of individual appropriation; and regarding them as only\ntransient and temporal possessions, he will not consider children and\nposterity, lands and property, or whatever else is personal, to be his own.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[466:1](vp117.htm#fr_1353) Munika, Vayu; Pulika, Matsya; \xc5\x9aunaka, Bhag.\n\n[466:2](vp117.htm#fr_1354) For 23 years, V. and M.\n\n[466:3](vp117.htm#fr_1355) 24 yrs.

V.; 27, M.: but the latter inserts a\nKan\xcc\x81wayana, 9 yrs., and Bhumimitra or Bhumiputra, 14 yrs., before him. In this\nand the preceding name we have appellations of considerable celebrity in the\ntraditions of the Bauddhas. Vidmisara, read also Vindhusara, Vilwisara, &c.,\nis most probably their Vimbasara, who was born at the same time with \xc5\x9aakya,\nand was reigning at Rajgriha when he began his religious career. The Mahawan\xc5\x9bo\nsays that Siddhatto and Bimbisaro were attached p. 467 friends, as their\nfathers had been before them: [p. 10](vp036.htm#page_10). \xc5\x9aakya is said to\nhave died in the reign of Ajata\xc5\x9batru, the son of Vimbasara, in the eighth year\nof his reign. The Vayu transposes these names, and the Matsya still more\nalters the order of Ajata\xc5\x9batru; but the Bhagavata concurs with our text. The\nBuddhist authority differs from the Puran\xcc\x81as materially as to the duration of\nthe reigns, giving to Bimbisaro 52 years, and to Ajatasattu 32: the latter,\naccording to the same, murdered his father. Mahawan\xc5\x9bo, p. 10. We may therefore\nwith some confidence claim for these princes a date of about six centuries B.\nC. They are considered co-temporary with Sudhodana, &c. in the list of the\nAikshwakavas ([p. 463](vp115.htm#page_463). n. [20](vp115.htm#fn_1327)).\n\n[467:14](vp117.htm#fr_1366) Harshaka, 25 yrs. V.; Vansaka, 24, M.\n\n[467:15](vp117.htm#fr_1367) 33 yrs. V.; Udibhi or Udasin, 33, M. According to\nthe Vayu, Udaya or Udaya\xc5\x9bwa founded Kusumapur or Pat\xcc\x81aliputra, on the southern\nangle of the Ganges. The legends of \xc5\x9aakya, consistently with this tradition,\ntake no notice of this city in his peregrinations on either bank of the\nGanges. The Mahawan\xc5\x9bo calls the son and successor of Ajata\xc5\x9batru, Udayibhadako\n(Udayinhhadraka): p. 15.\n\n[467:16](vp117.htm#fr_1368) 42 and 43 yrs. V.; 40 and 43, M. The Mahawan\xc5\x9bo has\nin place of these, Anuruddhako, Mundo, and Nagadaso; all in succession\nparricides: the last deposed by an insurrection of the people: p. 15.\n\n[467:17](vp117.htm#fr_1369) The several authorities agree in the number of ten\n\xc5\x9aai\xc5\x9bunagas, and in the aggregate years of their reigns, which the Matsya and\nthe Bhagavata call 360: the Vayu has 362, with which the several periods\ncorrespond: the details of the Matsya give 363. The Vayu and Matsya call the\n\xc5\x9aai\xc5\x9bunagas, Kshatrabandhus, which may designate an inferior order of\nKshatriyas: they also observe, that cotemporary with the dynasties already\nspecified, the Pauravas, the Varhadrathas, and Magadhas, there were other\nraces of royal descent; as, Aikshwakava princes, 24: Panchalas, 25, V.; 27, M:\nKalakas or Kasakas or Kaseyas, 24: Haihayas, 24, V.; 28, M.: Kalingas, 32, V.;\n40, M.: \xc5\x9aakas, V.; A\xc5\x9bmakas, M., 25: Kuravas, 26: Maithilas, 28: \xc5\x9aurasenas, 23:\nand Vitihotras, 20.\n\n[467:18](vp117.htm#fr_1370) The Bhagavata calls him Mahapadmapati, the lord of\nMahapadma; which the commentator interprets, \'sovereign of an infinite host,\'\nor \'of immense wealth;\' Mahapadma signifying 100.000 millions. The Vayu and\nMatsya, however, consider Mahapadma as another name of Nanda.\n\n[468:19](vp117.htm#fr_1371) So the Bhagavata also; but it would be more\ncompatible with chronology to consider the nine Nandas as so many descents.\nThe Vayu and Matsya give eighty-eight years to Mahapadma, and only the\nremaining twelve to Sumalya and the rest of the remaining eight; these twelve\nyears being occupied with the efforts of Kaut\xcc\x81ilya to expel the Nandas. The\nMahawan\xc5\x9bo, evidently intending the same events, gives names and circumstances\ndifferently; it may be doubted if with more accuracy. On the deposal of\nNagadaso, the people raised to the throne the minister Susunago, who reigned\neighteen years. This prince is evidently confounded with the \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9buuaga of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as. He was succeeded by his son Kalasoko, who reigned twenty years; and\nhe was succeeded by his sons, ten of whom reigned together for twenty-two\nyears: subsequently there were nine, who, according to their seniority,\nreigned for twenty-two years. The Brahman Chanako put the ninth surviving\nbrother, named Dhana-Nando (Rich-Nanda), to death, and installed Chandagutto.\nMahawan\xc5\x9bo, p. 15 and 21. These particulars, notwithstanding the alteration of\nsome of the names, belong clearly to one story; and that of the Buddhists\nlooks as if it was borrowed and modified from that of the Brahmans. The\ncommentary on the Mahawan\xc5\x9bo, translated by Mr. Turnour (Introduction, p.\nxxxviii.), calls the sons of Kalasoko \'the nine Nandas;\' but another Buddhist\nauthority, the Dipawan\xc5\x9bo, omits Kalasoko, and says that Susunago had ten\nbrothers, who after his demise reigned collectively twenty-two years. Journal\nof the As. Soc. of Bengal, Nov. 1838, p. 930.\n\n[468:20](vp117.htm#fr_1372) For the particulars of the story here alluded to,\nsee the Mudra Rakshasa, Hindu Theatre, vol. II. Kaut\xcc\x81ilya is also called,\naccording to the commentator on our text, Vatsyayana, Vishn\xcc\x81ugupta, and\nChan\xcc\x81akya. According to the Matsya P., Kant\xcc\x81ilya retained the regal authority\nfor a century; but there is some inaccuracy in the copies.\n\n[468:21](vp117.htm#fr_1373) This is the most important name in all the lists,\nas it can scarcely be doubted that he is the Sandrocottus, or, as Athenaeus\nwrites more correctly, the Sandrocoptus, of the Greeks, as I have endeavoured\nto prove in the introduction to the Mudra Rakshasa. The relative positions of\nChandragupta, Vidmisara, or Bimbisara, and Ajata\xc5\x9batru, serve to confirm the\nidentification. \xc5\x9aakya was cotemporary with both the latter, dying in the\neighth year of Ajata\xc5\x9batru\'s reign. The Mahawan\xc5\x9bo says he reigned twenty-four\nyears afterwards; but the Vayu makes his whole reign but twenty-five years,\nwhich would place the close of it B. C. 526. The rest of the \xc5\x9aai\xc5\x9bunaga\ndynasty, according to the Vayu and Matsya, reigned 143 or 140 years; bringing\ntheir close to B. C. 383. Another century being deducted for the duration of\nthe Nandas, would place the accession of p. 469 Chandragupta B. C. 283.\nChandragupta was the cotemporary of Seleucus Nicator, who began his reign B.\nC. 310, and concluded a treaty with him B. C. 305. Although therefore his date\nmay not be made out quite correctly from the Pauran\xcc\x81ik premises, yet the error\ncannot be more than twenty or thirty years. The result is much nearer the\ntruth than that furnished by Buddhist authorities. According to the Mahawan\xc5\x9bo\na hundred years had elapsed from the death of Buddha to the tenth year of the\nreign of Kalasoko (p. 15). He reigned other ten years, and his sons forty-\nfour, making a total of 154 years between the death of \xc5\x9aakya and the accession\nof Chandragupta, which is consequently placed B. C. 389, or above seventy\nyears too early. According to the Buddhist authorities, Chan-ta-kutta or\nChandragupta commenced his reign 396 B. C. Burmese Table; Prinsep\'s Useful\nTables. Mr. Turnour, in his Introduction, giving to Kalasoko eighteen years\nsubsequent to the century after Buddha, places Chandragupta\'s accession B. C.\n381, which, he observes, is sixty years too soon; dating, however, the\naccession of Chandragupta front 323 B. C. or immediately upon Alexander\'s\ndeath, a period too early by eight or ten years at least. The discrepancy of\ndates, Mr. Turnour is disposed to think, proceeds from some intentional\nperversion of the buddhistical chronology. Introd. p. L. The commentator on\nour text says that Chandragupta was the son of Nanda by a wife named Mura,\nwhence he and his descendants were called Mauryas. Col. Tod considers Maurya a\ncorruption of Mori, the name of a Rajput tribe. The T\xcc\x81ika on the Mahawan\xc5\x9bo\nbuilds a story on the fancied resemblance of the word to Mayura, S. Mori, Pr.\n\'a peacock.\' There being abundance of pea-fowl in the place where the Sakya\ntribe built a town, they called it Mori, and there princes were thence called\nMauryas. Turnour, Introduction to the Mahawan\xc5\x9bo, p. xxxix. Chandragupta\nreigned, according to the Vayu P., 24 years; according to the Mahawan\xc5\x9bo, 34;\nto the Dipawasan\xc5\x9bo, 24.\n\n[469:22](vp117.htm#fr_1374) So the Mahawan\xc5\x9bo, Bindusaro. Burmese Table, Bin-\ntu-sara. The Vayu has Bhadrasara, 25 years; the Bhagavata, Varisara. The\nMatsya names but four princes of this race, although it concurs with the\nothers in stating the series to consist of ten. The names are also differently\narranged, and one is peculiar: they are, \xc5\x9aatadhanwan, Vrihadratha, \xc5\x9auka, and\nDa\xc5\x9baratha.\n\n[469:23](vp117.htm#fr_1375) A\xc5\x9boka, 36 years, Vayu; \xc5\x9auka, 26, Mats.;\nA\xc5\x9bokavarddhana, Bhag.; A\xc5\x9boko and Dhamma\xc5\x9boko, Mahawan\xc5\x9bo. This king is the most\ncelebrated of any in the annals of the Buddhists. In the commencement of his\nreign he followed the Brahmanical faith, but became a convert to that of\nBuddha, and a zealous encourager of it. He is said to have maintained in his\npalace 64,000 Buddhist priests, and to have erected 84,000 columns or topes\nthroughout India. A great convocation of Buddhist priests was held in the\neighteenth year of his reign, which was followed by missions to Ceylon and\nother places. According to Buddhist chronology he ascended the throne 218\nyears after the death of Buddha, B. C. 325. As p. 470 the grandson of\nChandragupta, however, he must have been some time subsequent to this, or,\nagreeably to the joint duration of the reigns of Chandragupta and Bindusara,\nsupposing the former to have commenced his reign about B. C. 315, forty-nine\nyears later, or B. C. 266. The duration of his reign is said to have been\nthirty-six years, bringing it down to B. C. 230: but if we deduct these\nperiods from the date assignable to Chandragupta, of B. C. 283, we shall place\nA\xc5\x9boka\'s reign from B. C. 234 to 198. Now it is certain that a number of very\ncurious inscriptions, on columns and rocks, by a Buddhist prince, in an\nancient form of letter, and the Pali language, exist in India; and that some\nof them refer to Greek princes, who can be no other than members of the\nSeleucidan and Ptolemaean dynasties, and are probably Antiochus the Great and\nPtolemy Euergetes, kings of Syria and Egypt in the latter part of the third\ncentury before Christ. Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, February and\nMarch, 1838. The Indian king appears always under the appellation Piyada\xc5\x9bi or\nPriyadar\xc5\x9bin, \'the beautiful;\' and is entitled Devanam-piya, \'the beloved of\nthe gods.\' According to Buddhist authorities, the Rasawahini and Dipawan\xc5\x9bo,\nquoted by Mr. Turnour (J. As. Soc. of Bengal, Dec. 1837, p. 1056, and Nov.\n1838, p. 930), Piyada\xc5\x9bi or Piyada\xc5\x9bano is identified both by name and\ncircumstances with A\xc5\x9boka, and to him therefore the inscriptions must be\nattributed. Their purport agrees well enough with his character, and their\nwide diffusion with the traditionary report of the number of his monuments.\nHis date is not exactly that of Antiochus the Great, but it is not very far\ndifferent, and the corrections required to make it correspond are no more than\nthe inexact manner in which both Brahmanical and Buddhist chronology is\npreserved may well be expected to render necessary.\n\n[470:24](vp117.htm#fr_1376) The name of Da\xc5\x9baratha, in a similar ancient\ncharacter as that of Piyada\xc5\x9bi\'s inscriptions, has been found at Gaya amongst\nBuddhist remains, and like them decyphered by Mr. Prinsep, Journ. As. Soc.\nBengal, Aug. 1837, p. 677. A different series of names occurs in the Vayu; or,\nKu\xc5\x9bala, 8 yrs.; Bandhupalita, Indrapalita, Da\xc5\x9bavarman, 7 yrs.; \xc5\x9aatadhara, 8\nyrs.; and Vrihada\xc5\x9bwa, 7 yrs. The Bhagavata agrees in most of the names, and\nits omission of Da\xc5\x9baratha is corrected by the commentator.\n\n[470:25](vp117.htm#fr_1377) \xc5\x9aatadhanwan, Bhag.\n\n[470:26](vp117.htm#fr_1378) The Vayu says nine Sumurttyas reigned 137 years.\nThe Matsya and Bhagavata have ten Mauryas, and 137 years. The detailed numbers\nof the Vayu and Matsya differ from their totals, but the copies are manifestly\ncorrupt.\n\n[471:27](vp117.htm#fr_1379) The Bhagavata omits this name, but states that\nthere were ten \xc5\x9aungas, although, without Pushpamitra, only nine are named. The\nVayu and Matsya have the same account of the circumstances of his accession to\nthe throne; the former gives him a reign of sixty, the latter of thirty-six\nyears. In a play attributed to Kalidasa, the Malavikagnimitra, of which\nAgnimitra is the hero, his father is alluded to as the Senani or general, as\nif he had deposed his master in favour, not of himself, but of his son.\nAgnimitra is termed king of Vidi\xc5\x9ba, not of Magadha. Pushpamitra is represented\nas engaged in a conflict with the Yavanas on the Indus; thus continuing the\npolitical relations with the Greeks or Scythians of Bactria and Ariana. See\nHindu Theatre, vol. I. 347.\n\n[471:28](vp117.htm#fr_1380) 8 yrs. V.; omitted M.\n\n[471:29](vp117.htm#fr_1381) 7 yrs.

The Vayu and Matsya have the same period.\n\n[471:38](vp117.htm#fr_1390) The names of the four princes agree in all the\nauthorities. The Matsya transfers the character of Vyasani to the minister,\nwith the further addition of his being a Brahman; Dwija. In the lists given by\nSir Wm. Jones and Col. Wilford, the four Kan\xcc\x81was are said to have reigned 345\nyears; but in seven copies of the Vishn\xcc\x81u P., from different parts of India,\nthe number is, as given in the text, forty-five. There is however authority\nfor the larger number, both in the text of the Bhagavata and the comment. The\nformer has, #### and the latter, ### p. 472 There is no doubt therefore of the\npurport of the text; and it is only surprising that such a chronology should\nhave been inserted in the Bhagavata, not only in opposition to all\nprobability, but to other authority. The Vayu and Matsya not only confirm the\nlower number by stating it as a total, but by giving it in detail; thus:\n\nVasudeva will reign\n\n|\n\n 9 years  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nBhumimitra\n\n|\n\n14  \n  \nNarayan\xcc\x81a\n\n|\n\n12  \n  \nSu\xc5\x9barman\n\n|\n\n_10_  \n  \nTotal\n\n|\n\n45  \n  \n[paragraph continues] And six copies of the Matsya concur in this statement.\n\n[472:39](vp117.htm#fr_1391) The expressions Andhrajatiyas and Andhrabhrityas\nhave much perplexed Col. Wilford, who makes three races out of one, \xc3\x81ndhras,\nAndhrajatiyas, and Andhrabhrityas. As. Res. IX. 101. There is no warrant for\nthree races in the Puran\xcc\x81as, although the Matsya, and perhaps the Vayu,\ndistinguishes two, as we shall hereafter see. Our text has but one, to which\nall the terms may be applied. The first of the dynasty was an \xc3\x81ndhra by birth\nor caste (jatiya), and a servant (bhritya) of the last of the Kan\xcc\x81wa race. So\nthe Vayu; ###: the Matsya; ### and the Bhagavata; ###. The terms \'an Andhra by\ncaste\' and \'a Bhritya or servant,\' with the addition, in the last passage, of\nVrishala, \'a \xc5\x9audra,\' all apply to one person and one dynasty. Wilford has made\nwild work with his triad. The name of the first of this race is variously\nread: Sindhuka, Vayu; \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9buka, Matsya; Balin, Bhag.; and, according to Wilford,\nChhismaka in the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a P., and \xc5\x9audraka or \xc5\x9auraka in the Kumarika\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Skanda P. As. Res. IX. 107. He reigned 23 years, Vayu and\nMatsya. If the latter form of his name be correct, he may be the king who is\nspoken of in the prologue to the Mrichchhakat\xcc\x81i.\n\n[472:40](vp117.htm#fr_1392) 10 yrs.

The Matsya has the whole 29 names, adding several to the list of our\ntext; and the aggregate of the reigns amounts to 435 years and 6 months. The\ndifference between this and the total specified arises probably from some\ninaccuracy in the MSS.

The adjuncts Swati and \xc5\x9aatikarn\xcc\x81a appear to be conjoined or not with the\nother appellations, according to the convenience of, the metre, and seem to be\nthe family designations or titles. The dynasty is of considerable\nchronological interest, as it admits of some plausible verifications. That a\npowerful race of Andhra princes ruled in India in the beginning of the\nChristian era, we learn from Pliny, who describes them as possessed of thirty\nfortified cities, with an army of 100,000 men and 1000 elephants. The Andrae\nof this writer are probably the people of the upper part of the peninsula,\nAndhra being the proper designation of Telingana. The Peutingerian tables,\nhowever, place the Andre-Indi on the banks of the Ganges, and the southern\nprinces may have extended or shifted the site of their power. Towards the\nclose of the dynasty we find names that appear to agree with those of princes\nof middle India, of whom mention is made by the Chinese; as, Yue-gnai\n(Yajna\xc5\x9bri), king of Kiapili, A. D. 408; Des Guignes, I. 45; and Ho-lo-mien\n(Puloman), king of Magadha in 621; ibid. I. 56. The Pauran\xcc\x81ik lists place\nthese two princes more nearly together, but we cannot rely implicitly upon\ntheir accuracy. Calculating from Chandragupta downwards, the Indian date of\nYajna and the Chinese Yue-gnai corresponds; for we have,\n\n10\n\n|\n\nMauryas\n\n|\n\n137\n\n|\n\nyrs.  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n10\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9aungas\n\n|\n\n112\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n4\n\n|\n\nKan\xcc\x81was\n\n|\n\n45\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n27\n\n|\n\nAndhras\n\n|\n\n_437_\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n731\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nDeduct for Chandragupta\'s date\n\n|\n\n312\n\n|\n\nB.

If the Indian Puloman be the same with the Chinese Ho-lo-mien, there\nmust be some considerable omission in the Pauran\xcc\x81ik dynasty. There is a\nfarther identification in the case of Ho-lo-mien, which makes it certain that\na prince of Magadha is intended, as the place of his residence is called by\nthe Chinese Kia-so-mo-pulo-ching and Potoli-tse-Ching; or in Sanscrit, Kusuma-\npura and Pat\xcc\x81ali-putra. The equivalent of the latter name consists, not only\nin the identity of the sounds Pat\xcc\x81ali and Po-to-li, but in the translation of\n\'putra\' by \'tse;\' each word meaning in their respective languages \'son.\' No\ndoubt can be entertained therefore that the city intended is the metropolis of\nMagadha, Pat\xcc\x81aliputra or Palibothra. Wilford identifies Pulomat or Puloman\nwith the Po-lo-muen of the Chinese; but Des Guignes interprets Po-lo-muen kue,\n\'royaume des Brahmanes.\' Buchanan (Hamilton), following the Bhagavata as to\nthe name of the last king, Sulomadhi, would place him about A. D. 846; but his\npremises are far from accurate, p. 475 and his deduction in this instance at\nleast is of no weight. Geneal. of the Hindus, Introd. p. 16. He supposes the\nAndhra kings of Magadha to have retained their power on the Ganges until the\nMohammedan invasion, or the twelfth century, when they retired to the south,\nand reigned at Warankal in Telingana. Inscriptions and coins, however, confirm\nthe statement of the Puran\xcc\x81as, that a different dynasty succeeded to the\nAndhras some centuries before the Mohammedan conquests; and the Chinese also\nrecord, that upon the death of the king of Magadha, Ho-lo-mien (Puloman?),\nsome time before A. D. 648, great troubles in India took place. Des Guignes.\nSome very curious and authentic testimony to the actual existence of these\nAndhra kings has been lately afforded by the discovery of an ancient\ninscription in Guzerat, in which Rudra Dama, the Kshatrapa or Satrap of\nSurasht\xcc\x81ra, is recorded to have repeatedly overcome \xc5\x9aatakarn\xcc\x81i, king of the\nsouthern country (Dakshin\xcc\x81apatha). The inscription is without date, but it is\nin an old character, and makes mention of the two Maurya princes, Chandragupta\nand A\xc5\x9boka, as if not very long prior to its composition. Mr. J. Prinsep, to\nwhom we are indebted for the decyphering and translating of this important\ndocument, has been also successful in decyphering the legends on a series of\ncoins belonging to the princes of Surasht\xcc\x81ra, amongst whom the name of Rudra\nDama occurs; and he is inclined, although with hesitation, to place these\nprinces about a century after Anoka, or Rudra Dama about 153 B. C. J. As. Soc.\nBengal, May 1837, and April 1838. According to the computation hazarded above\nfrom our text, the race of Andhra kings should not commence till about 20\nyears B. C., which would agree with Pliny\'s notice of them; but it is possible\nthat they existed earlier in the south of India, although they established\ntheir authority in Magadha only in the first centuries of the Christian era.\n\n[475:64](vp117.htm#fr_1416) These parallel dynasties are thus particularized\nin our other authorities:\n\n\xc3\x81bhiras, 7, M.; 10, V; kings of Avabhriti, 7, Bhag.\n\nGarddabhins, 10, M. V. Bhag.\n\n\xc5\x9aakas, 18, M. V.; Kankas, 16, Bhag.\n\nYavanas, 8, M. V. Bhag.\n\nTusharas, 14, M.

The numbers are apparently intended to be the same, but those of\nthe Matsya are palpable blunders, although almost all the MSS. agree in the\nreading. The chronology of the Vayu is, \xc3\x81bhiras, 67 years; Garddabhins, 72;\n\xc5\x9aakas, 380; Yavanas, 82; Tusharas, 500 (all the copies of the Matsya have\n7000); Marun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, 200; and Mlechchhas, intending perhaps Maunas, 300 yrs.\nTotal 1601 years, or less than 19 years to a reign. They are not however\ncontinuous, but nearly cotemporary dynasties; and if they comprise, as they\nprobably do, the Greek and Scythian princes of the west of India, the periods\nmay not be very wide p. 476 of the truth. The Matsya begins the list with one\nmore dynasty, another Andhra (see n. 39), of whom there were seven: \'When the\ndominion of the Andhras has ceased, there shall be seven other Andhras, kings\nof the race of their servants; and then nine \xc3\x81bhiras.\' The passage of the\nVayu, although somewhat similar in terms, has a different purport: \'Of these,\nthe Andhras having passed away, there shall be seven cotemporary races; as,\nten \xc3\x81bhiras,\' &c. The passage is differently read in different copies, but\nthis is the only intelligible reading. At the same time it subsequently\nspecifies a period for the duration of the Andhra dynasty different from that\nbefore given, or three hundred years, as if a different race was referred to:\n\'The Andhras shall possess the earth two hundred years and one hundred.\' The\nMatsya has twice five hundred: \'The \xc5\x9ariparvatiya Andhras twice five hundred\nyears.\' One MS. has more consistently fifty-two years. But there is evidently\nsomething faulty in all the MSS. The expression of the Matsya, \'\xc5\x9ariparvatiya\nAndhras,\' is remarkable; \xc5\x9ariparvat being in Telingana. There is probably some\nconfusion of the two races, the Magadha and Tailinga kings, in these passages\nof the Puran\xcc\x81as. The Bhagavata has a dynasty of seven Andhra kings, but of a\ndifferent period (see n. 39). Col. Wilford has attempted a verification of\nthese dynasties; in some instances perhaps with success, though certainly not\nin all. The \xc3\x81bhiras he calls the shepherd kings of the north of India: they\nwere more probably Greeks or Scythians or Parthians, along the lower Indus:\ntraces of the name occur, as formerly observed, in the Abiria of Ptolemy, and\nthe \xc3\x81hirs as a distinct race still exist in Guzerat. Araish Mehfil. The \xc5\x9aakas\nare the Sacae, and the duration of their power is not unlikely to be near the\ntruth. The eight Yavana kings may be, as he supposes, Greek princes of\nBactria, or rather of western India. The Tusharas he makes the Parthians. If\nthe Bhagavata has the preferable reading, Tushkaras, they were the Tochari, a\nScythian race. The Murun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, or, as he has it, Maurun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, he considers to\nbe a tribe of Huns, the Morundae of Ptolemy. According to the Matsya they were\nof Mlechchha origin, Mlechchha-sambhava. The Vayu calls them Arya-mlechchhas;\nquere, Barbarians of Ariana. Wilford regards the Maunas as also a tribe of\nHuns; and the word is in all the MSS. of the Matsya, Hun\xcc\x81as; traces of whom\nmay be still found in the west and south of India. Inscription at Merritch.\nJourn. R. As. vol. III. p. 103. The Garddabhins Wilford conjectures to be\ndescendants of Bahram Gor, king of Persia; but this is very questionable. That\nthey were a tribe in the west of India may be conjectured, as some strange\ntales prevail there of a Gandharba, changed to an ass, marrying the daughter\nof the king of Dhar. As. Res. VI. 35, and IX. 147; also \'Cutch\' by Mrs.\nPostans, p. 18: fables suggested no doubt by the name Garddabha, signifying an\nass. There is also p. 477 evidently some affinity between these Garddabhins\nand the old Gadhia Pysa, or ass-money, as vulgarly termed, found in various\nparts of western India, and which is unquestionably of ancient date. Journ.\nAs. Soc. Bengal, Dec. 1835, p. 688. It may be the coinage of the Garddabha\nprinces; Garddabla, being the original of Gadha, meaning also an ass. I have\nelsewhere conjectured the possibility of their being current about a century\nand a half before our era. Journ. R. As. Soc. vol. III. 385. Col. Tod, quoting\na parallel passage in Hindi, reads, instead of Garddhabhin, Gor-ind, which he\nexplains the Indras or lords of Gor; but the reading is undoubtedly erroneous.\n\n[477:65](vp117.htm#fr_1417) The copies agree in reading Pauras, but the\ncommentator remarks that it is sometimes Maunas, but they have already been\nspecified; unless the term be repeated in order to separate the duration of\nthis dynasty from that of the rest. Such seems to be the purport of the\nsimilar passage of the Bhagavata. These kings (Andhras, &c.) will possess the\nearth 1099 years, and the eleven Maulas 300.\' No such name as Pauras occurs in\nthe other authorities. The analogy of duration identifies them with the\nMlechchhas of the Vayu: \'Eleven Mlechchhas will possess the earth for three\ncenturies:\' and the Vayu may refer to the Maunas, as no other period is\nassigned for them. The periods of the Bhagavata, 1099 and 300, come much to\nthe same as that of our text, 1390; the one including the three centuries of\nthe Maunas, the other stating it separately. The Vayu apparently adds it to\nthe rest, thus making the total 1601, instead of 1390. It is evident that the\nsame scheme is intended by the several authorities, although some inaccuracy\naffects either the original statement or the existing manuscripts.\n\n[477:66](vp117.htm#fr_1418) Kilakila, Kolakila, Kolikila, Kilinakila, as it is\nvariously read. Sir Wm. Jones\'s Pandit stated that he understood it to be a\ncity in the Mahratta country (As. Res. XI. 142); and there has been found a\nconfirmation of his belief in an inscription, where Kilagila, as it is there\ntermed, is called the capital of Marasinha Deva, king of the Konkan. Journ. R.\nAs. Soc. vol. IV. p. 282. This inscription dates A. D. 1058. The Puran\xcc\x81as\nrefer probably to a long antecedent date, when the Greek princes, or their\nIndo-Scythic successors, following the course of the Indus, spread to the\nupper part of the western coast of the peninsula. The text calls them Yavanas;\nand the Vayu and Matsya say they were Yavanas in institutions, manners, and\npolicy. The Bhagavata names five of their princes, Bhutananda, p. 478 Bangiri,\n\xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bunandi, Ya\xc5\x9bnandi, and Pravira, who will reign 106 years, and they are\ntherefore imperfect representatives of the series in our text. The Matsya has\nno farther specific enumeration of any dynasty. The Vayu makes Pravira the son\nof Vindhya\xc5\x9bakti; the latter reigning 96 years, and the former 60: the latter\nis king of Kanchana puri, \'the golden city,\' and is followed by four sons,\nwhose names are not mentioned. Between Vindhya\xc5\x9bakti and Pravira, however, a\ndynasty of kings is introduced, some of the names of which resemble those of\nthe Kilakila princes of the text. They are, Bhogin the son of Seshanaga,\nSadachandra, Nakhavat, Dhanadhamita, Vin\xc5\x9baja, Bhutinanda--at a period before\nthe end of the \xc5\x9aungas? (the copies have ###)--Madhunandi, his younger brother\nNandiya\xc5\x9bas; and in his race there will be three other Rajas, Dauhitra, \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9buka,\nand Ripukayan. These are called princes of Vidi\xc5\x9ba or Vide\xc5\x9ba; the latter\nmeaning perhaps \'foreign,\' and constitute the Naga dynasty. Our text calls\nVindhya\xc5\x9bakti a Murddhabhishikta, a warrior of a mixed race, sprung from a\nBrahman father and Kshatriya mother.\n\n[478:67](vp117.htm#fr_1419) The text of this passage runs thus: ###. \'Their\nsons,\' the commentator explains by \'thirteen sons of Vindhya\xc5\x9bakti and the\nrest.\' The Bhagavata has a different statement, identifying the sons of the\nVindhya race with the Bahlikas, and making them thirteen: \'The Bahlikas will\nbe their thirteen sons.\' As the commentator; \'There will be severally thirteen\nsons, called Bahlikas, of Bhutananda and the rest.\' The following verse\n\'Pushpamitra, a king, and then Durmitra:\' who or what they were does not\nappear. The commentator says, Pushpamitra was another king, and Durmitra was\nhis son. Here is evidently careless and inaccurate compilation. The Vayu,\nthough not quite satisfactory, accords better with our text. \'Pravira,\' it\nsays, will have four sons: when the Vindhya race is extinct, there will be\nthree Bahlika kings, Supratika, Nabhira, who will reign thirty years, and\n\xc5\x9aakyamanabhava (quere this name), king of the Mahishas. The Pushpamitras will\nthen be, and the Pat\xcc\x81umitras also, who will be seven kings of Mekala. Such is\nthe generation.\' The plural verb with only two Bahlika names indicates some\nomission, unless we correct it to it \'they two will reign;\' but the following\nname and title, \xc5\x9aakyamanabhava, king of the Mahishas, seems to have little\nconnexion with the Bahlikas. If, in a subsequent part of the citation, the\nreading \'trayoda\xc5\x9ba\' be correct, it must then be thirteen Pat\xcc\x81umitras; but it\nwill be difficult to know what to do with Sapta, \'seven\' If for Santati we\nmight read p. 479 Saptati, \'seventy,\' the sense might be, \'these thirteen\nkings ruled for seventy-seven years.\' However this may be, it seems most\ncorrect to separate the thirteen sons or families of the Vindhya princes from\nthe three Bahlikas, and them from the Pushpamitras and Pat\xcc\x81umitras, who\ngoverned Mekala, a country on the Narbada (see [p. 186](vp061.htm#page_186).\nn. [18](vp061.htm#fn_494)). What the Bahlikas, or princes of Balkh, had to do\nin this part of India is doubtful. The Durmitra of the Bhagavata has been\nconjectured by Col. Tod (Trans. R. As. Soc. I. 325) to be intended for the\nBactrian prince Demetrius: but it is not clear that even the Bhagavata\nconsiders this prince as one of the Bahlikas, and the name occurs nowhere\nelse.\n\n[479:68](vp117.htm#fr_1420) For the situation of Ko\xc5\x9bala, see [p.\n190](vp061.htm#page_190). n. [79](vp061.htm#fn_555). The three copies of the\nVayu read Komala, and call the kings, the Meghas, more strong than sapient.\nThe Bhagavata agrees with our text. The Vayu says of the Naishadhas, or kings\nof Nishadha, that they were all of the race of Nala. The Bhagavata adds two\nother races, seven Andhras (see note 63) and kings of Vaidura, with the remark\nthat these were all cotemporaries, being, as the commentator observes, petty\nor provincial rulers.\n\n[479:69](vp117.htm#fr_1421) The Vayu has Vi\xc5\x9bwasphan\xcc\x81i and Vi\xc5\x9bwasphin\xcc\x81i; the\nBhagavata, Vi\xc5\x9bwasphurtti, or in some MSS. Vi\xc5\x9bwaphuiji. The castes he\nestablishes or places in authority, to the exclusion of the Kshatriyas, are\ncalled in all the copies of our text Kaivarttas, Pat\xcc\x81us, Pulindas, and\nBrahmans. The Vayu (three MSS.) has Kaivarttas, Panchakas, Pulindas, and\nBrahmans. The Bhagavata has, Pulindas, Yadus, and Madrakas. The Vayu describes\nVi\xc5\x9bwasphan\xcc\x81i as a great warrior, and apparently as a eunuch: He worshipped the\ngods and manes, and dying on the banks of the Ganges went to the heaven of\nIndra.\n\n[479:70](vp117.htm#fr_1422) Such appears to be the purport of our text. The\nnine Nagas might be thought to mean the same as the descendants of \xc5\x9aesha Naga,\nbut the Vayu has another series here, analogous to that of the text: \'The nine\nNaka kings will possess the city Champavati, and the seven Nagas (?) the\npleasant city Mathura. Princes of the Gupta race will possess all these\ncountries, the banks of the Ganges to Prayaga and Saketa and Magadha.\' p. 480\nThis account is the most explicit, and probably most accurate, of all. The\nNakas were Rajas of Bhagalpur; the Nagas, of Mathura; and the intermediate\ncountries along the Ganges were governed by the Guptas, or Rajas of the Vai\xc5\x9bya\ncaste. The Bhagavata seems to have taken great liberties with the account, as\nit makes Vi\xc5\x9bwasphurtti king over Anuganga, the course of the Ganges from\nHaridwar, according to the commentator, to Prayaga, residing at Padmavati:\nomitting the Nagas altogether, and converting \'gupta\' into an epithet of\n\'medini,\' the preserved or protected earth. Wilford considers the Nagas,\nNakas, and Guptas to be all the same: he says, \'Then came a dynasty of nine\nkings, called the nine Nagas or Nagas; these were an obscure tribe, called for\nthat reason Guptavan\xc5\x9bas, who ruled in Padmavati.\' That city he calls Patna;\nbut in the Malati and Madhava, Padmavati lies amongst the Vindhya hills.\nKantipuri he makes Cotwal, near Gwalior. The reading of the Vayu, Champavati,\nhowever, obviates the necessity of all vague conjecture. According to Wilford\nthere is a powerful tribe still called Nakas between the Jamuna and the Betwa.\nOf the existence and power of the Guptas, however, we have recently had ample\nproofs from inscriptions and coins, as in the Chandragupta and Samudragupta of\nthe Allatabad column; Journ. As. Soc. Bengal, March and June, 1834; and\nKumaragupta, Chandragupta, Samudragupta, \xc5\x9aa\xc5\x9bigupta, &c. on the Archer coins,\nfound at Kanoj and elsewhere; As. Res. XVII. pl. 1. fig. 5, 7, 13, 19; and\nJourn. As. Soc. Bengal, Nov. 1835, pl. 38 and 39; and in other numbers of the\nsame Journal: in all which, the character in which the legends are written is\nof a period prior to the use of the modern Devanagari, and was current in all\nprobability about the fifth century of our era, as conjectured by Mr. Prinsep:\nsee his table of the modifications of the Sanscrit alphabet from 543 B. C. to\n1200 A. D. Journ. As. Soc. Bengal, March 1838.\n\n[480:71](vp117.htm#fr_1423) The Vayu also mentions the descendants of\nDevarakshita or Daivarakshitas as kings of the Ko\xc5\x9balas, Tamralipta, and the\nsea coast; so far conforming with our text as to include the western parts of\nBengal, Tamlook, Medinipur, and Orissa. One copy reads Andhra, perhaps for\nOd\xcc\x81ra, Orissa; and one has Champa for the capital, which is probably an error,\nalthough the two other MSS., being still more faulty, do not offer the means\nof correction.\n\n[480:72](vp117.htm#fr_1424) The Vayu has the same. The countries are parts of\nOrissa and Berar.\n\n[480:73](vp117.htm#fr_1425) The Vayu has sons of Man\xcc\x81idhan\xcc\x81ya for the ruling\ndynasty, but names the countries those of the Naishadhas, Yudakas, \xc5\x9aa\xc5\x9bikas,\nand Kalatoyas. The first name applies to a tract of country near p. 481 the\nVindhya mountains, but the last to a country in the north. The west or\nsouthwest, however, is probably intended in this place.\n\n[481:74](vp117.htm#fr_1426) The Stri Rajya is usually placed in Bhote. It may\nperhaps here designate Malabar, where polyandry equally prevails. Mushika, or\nthe country of thieves, was the pirate coast of the Konkan. The Vayu reads\nBhokshyaka or Bhokhyaka for Mushika. The Bhagavata omits all these\nspecifications subsequent to the notice of Viwasphurtti.\n\n[481:75](vp117.htm#fr_1427) From this we might infer that the Vishn\xcc\x81u P. was\ncompiled when the Mohammedans were making their first encroachments on the\nwest. They seem to have invaded and to have settled in Sindh early in the\neighth century, although Indian princes continued on the Indus for a\nsubsequent period. Scriptor. Arab. de rebus Indicis. Gildemeister, p. 6. They\nwere engaged in hostilities in 698 or 700 with the prince of Kabul, in whose\nname, however disguised by its Mohammedan representations of Ratil, Ratbal, or\nRatibal, it is not difficult to recognise the genuine Hindu appellation of\nRatanpal, or Ratnapal. Their progress in this direction has not been traced;\nbut at the period of their invasion of Sindh they advanced to Multan, and\nprobably established themselves there and at Lahore within a century. Kashmir\nthey did not occupy till a much later date, and the Raja Tarangini takes no\nnotice of any attacks upon it; but the Chinese have recorded an application\nfrom the king of Kashmir, Chin-tho-lo-pi-li, evidently the Chandrapid\xcc\x81a of the\nSanscrit, for aid against the Arabs, about A. D. 713. Gildemeister, p. 13.\nAlthough, therefore, not actually settled at the Panjab so early as the\nbeginning, they had commenced their incursions, and had no doubt made good\ntheir footing by the end of the eighth or commencement of the ninth century.\nThis age of the Puran\xcc\x81a is compatible with reference to the cotemporary race\nof Gupta kings, from the fourth or fifth to the seventh or eighth century; or,\nif we are disposed to go farther back, we may apply the passage to the Greek\nand Indo-Scythian princes. It seems more likely to be the former period; but\nin all such passages in this or other Puran\xcc\x81as there is the risk that verses\ninspired by the presence of Mohammedan rulers may have been interpolated into\nthe original text. Had the Mohammedans of Hindustan, however, been intended by\nthe latter, the indications would have been more distinct, and the localities\nassigned to them more central. Even the Bhagavata, the date of which we have\ngood reason for conjecturing to be the middle of the twelfth century, and\nwhich influenced the form assumed about that time by the worship of Vishn\xcc\x81u,\ncannot be thought to refer to the Mohammedan conquerors of p. 482 upper India.\nIt is there stated, that rulers fallen from their castes, or \xc5\x9audras, will be\nthe princes of Saurasht\xcc\x81ra, Avanti, Abhira, \xc5\x9aura, Arbuda, and Malava; and\nbarbarians, \xc5\x9audras, and other outcastes, not enlightened by the Vedas, will\npossess Kashmir, Kaunti, and the banks of the Chandrabhaga and Indus.\' Now it\nwas not until the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that the Mohammedans\nestablished themselves in Guzerat and Malwa, and the Bhagavata was\nunquestionably well known in various parts of India long before that time.\n(Account of Hindu Sects, As. Res. vol. XVI.) It cannot therefore allude to\nMohammedans. By specifying the princes as seceders from the Vedas, there is no\ndoubt that the barbarians and outcastes intended are so only in a religious\nsense; and we know from indisputable authorities that the western countries,\nGuzerat, Abu, Malava, were the chief seats, first of the Buddhists, and then\nof the Jainas, from a period commencing perhaps before the Christian era, and\nscarcely terminating with the Mohammedan conquest. Inscriptions from Abu, As.\nRes. vol. XVI.\n\n[482:76](vp117.htm#fr_1428) The commentator, having no doubt the existing\nstate of things in view, interprets the passage somewhat differently: the\noriginal is, ###. The comment explains \'strong\', and adds, the Mlechchhas will\nbe in the centre, and the \xc3\x81ryyas at the end:\' meaning, if any thing, that the\nunbelievers are in the heart of the country, and the Hindus on the borders: a\ndescription, however, never correct, except as applicable to the governments;\nand in that case inconsistent with the text, which had previously represented\nthe bordering countries in the hands of outcastes and heretics. All that the\ntext intends, is to represent infidels and foreigners high in power, and the\nBrahmans depressed. It is not unlikely that the reading is erroneous,\nnotwithstanding the copies concur, and that the passage should be here the\nsame as that of the Vayu; \'Intermixed with them, the nations, adopting every\nwhere barbaric p. 483 institutions, exist in a state of disorder, and the\nsubjects shall be destroyed.\' The expression Mlechchhachara\xc5\x9bcha being used\ninstead of Mlechchha\xc5\x9bcharya\xc5\x9bcha. A passage similar to that of the text,\nnoticing the intermixture of Hindus and barbarians, occurs in a different\nplace (see [p. 175](vp060.htm#page_175). n. [4](vp060.htm#fn_392)), and\ndesignates tare condition of India in all ages: at no period has the whole of\nthe population followed Brahmanical Hinduism.\n\n[483:77](vp117.htm#fr_1429) That is, there will be no Tirthas, places held\nsacred, and objects of pilgrimage; no particular spot of earth will have any\nespecial sanctity.\n\n[483:78](vp117.htm#fr_1430) Gifts will be made from the impulse of ordinary\nfeeling, not in connexion with religious rites, and as an act of devotion; and\nablution will be performed for pleasure or comfort, not religiously with\nprescribed ceremonies and prayers.\n\n[483:79](vp117.htm#fr_1431) The expression Sadve\xc5\x9badharin is explained to mean\neither one who wears fine clothes, or who assumes the exterior garb of\nsanctity. Either interpretation is equally allowable.\n\n[484:80](vp117.htm#fr_1432) The Bhagavata agrees with the text in these\nparticulars. The chief star of Tishya is \xce\xb4 in the constellation Cancer.\n\n[484:81](vp117.htm#fr_1433) All the copies concur in this reading. Three\ncopies of the Vayu assign to the same interval 1050 years: and of the Matsya\nfive copies have the same, or 1050 years; whilst one copy has 1500 years. The\nBhagavata has 1115 years; which the commentator explains, \'a thousand years\nand a hundred with fifteen over.\' He notices nevertheless, although he does\nnot attempt to account for the discrepancy, that the total period from\nParikshit to Nanda was actually, according to the duration of the different\nintermediate dynasties, as enumerated by all the authorities, fifteen\ncenturies; viz.\n\nMagadha kings\n\n|\n\n1000\n\n|\n\nyrs.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nPradyota, &c.\n\n|\n\n138\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bunaga, &c.\n\n|\n\n_362_\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n1500\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[paragraph continues] The shorter period is best proportioned to the number of\nkings; for reckoning from Sahadeva, who was cotemporary with Parikshit, and\ntaking the number of the Varhadrathas from the Matsya, we have thirty-two of\nthem, five of the Pradyota race, and ten \xc5\x9aai\xc5\x9bunagas, or in all forty-seven;\nwhich, as the divisor of 1050, gives rather more than twenty-two years to a\nreign. The Vayu and the Matsya further specify the interval from Nanda to\nPulomat, the last of the \xc3\x81ndhra kings, as being 836 years; a total that does\nnotp. 485 agree exactly with the items previously specified:\n\n9\n\n|\n\nNandas\n\n|\n\n100\n\n|\n\nyrs.  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n10\n\n|\n\nMauryas\n\n|\n\n137\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n10\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9aungas\n\n|\n\n112\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n4\n\n|\n\nKan\xcc\x81was\n\n|\n\n45\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n_29_\n\n|\n\nAndhras\n\n|\n\n_460_\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n62\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n854\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[paragraph continues] In either case the average duration of reign is not\nimprobable, as the highest number gives less than fourteen years to each\nprince. It is important to remember that the reign of Parikshit is, according\nto Hindu chronology, coeval with the commencement of the Kali age; and even\ntherefore taking the longest Pauran\xcc\x81ik interval we have but sixteen centuries\nbetween Chandragupta--or considering him as the same with Sandrocoptos,\nnineteen centuries B. C.--for the beginning of the Kali age. According to the\nchronology of our text, however, it would be but B. C. 1415; to that of the\nVayu and Matsya, B. C. 1450; and to that of the Bhagavata, 1515. According to\nCol. Wilford\'s computations (As. Res. vol. IX. Chron. Table, p. 116) the\nconclusion of the great war took place B. C. 1370: Buchanan conjectures it to\nhave occurred in the thirteenth century B. C. Vyasa was the putative father of\nPan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u and Dhritarasht\xcc\x81ra, and consequently was cotemporary with the heroes\nof the great war. Mr. Colebrooke infers from astronomical data that the\narrangement of the Vedas attributed to Vyasa took place in the fourteenth\ncentury B.C. Mr. Bentley brings the date of Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira, the chief of the\nPan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81avas, to 575 B. C. (Historical View of Hindu Astronomy, p. 67); but the\nweight of authority is in favour of the thirteenth or fourteenth century B. C.\nfor the war of the Mahabharata, and the reputed commencement of the Kali age.\n\n[485:82](vp117.htm#fr_1434) A similar explanation is given in the Bhagavata,\nVayu, and Matsya Puran\xcc\x81as; and like accounts from astronomical writers are\ncited by Mr. Colebrooke, As. Res. vol. IX. p. 358. The commentator on the\nBhagavata thus explains the notion: "The two stars (Pulaha and Kratu) must\nrise or be visible before the rest, and whichever asterism is in a line south\nfrom the middle of those stars, is that with which the seven stars are united;\nand so they continue for one hundred years." Col. Wilford has also given a\nlike explanation of the revolution of the Rishis; As. Res. vol. IX. p. 83.\nAccording to Bentley the notion originated in a contrivance of the astronomers\nto shew the quantity of the precession of the equinoxes. "This was by assuming\nan imaginary line or great circle passing through the poles of the ecliptic\nand the beginning of the fixed Magha, which circle was supposed to cut some of\nthe stars in the Great Bear. The seven stars in the Great Bear the circle so\nassumed was called the line of the Rishis, and being fixed to the beginning of\nthe lunar asterism Magha, the precession would be solved by stating the degree\n&c. of any moveable lunar mansion cut by that fixed line or circle as an p.\n486 index. Historical View of Hindu Astronomy, p. 65.\n\n[486:83](vp117.htm#fr_1435) The Bhagavata has the same; and this agrees with\nthe period assigned for the interval between Parikshit and Nanda of 1050\nyears; as, including Magha, we have ten asterisms to Purvashad\xcc\x81ha, or 1000\nyears. The Vayu and Matsya are so very inaccurate in all the copies consulted,\nthat it is not safe to affirm what they mean to describe. Apparently they\nstate that at the end of the Andhra dynasty the Rishis will be in Krittika,\nwhich furnishes other ten asterisms; the whole being nearly in accordance with\nthe chronology of the text, as the total interval from Parikshit to the last\nof the Andhras is 1050 + 836 =1886, and the entire century of each asterism at\nthe beginning and end of the series need not be taken into account. The copies\nof the Matsya read, \'The seven Rishis are on a line with the brilliant Agni;\'\nthat is, with Krittika, of which Agni is the presiding deity. The Vayu intends\nin all probability the same phrase, but the three copies have, ### a very\nunintelligible clause. Again, it seems as if they intended to designate the\nend of the Andhra race as the period of a complete revolution, or 2700 years;\nfor the Vayu has, \'The races at the end of the Andhas will be after 2700\nyears:\' the Matsya has, ### and at the close of the passage, after specifying\nas usual that \'the seven Rishis were in Magha in the time of Parikshit,\' the\nVayu adds, ### a passage which, though repeated in the MSS., is obviously most\ninaccurate; although it might perhaps be understood to intimate that the\nRishis will be in the twenty-fourth asterism after the Andhra race; but that\nwould give only 1400 years from Parikshit to Pulomat; whilst if the twenty-\nfourth from Magha was intended, it would give 2400 years: both periods being\nincompatible with previous specifications. The Matsya has a different reading\nof the second line, but one not much more satisfactory; \'A hundred years of\nBrahma will be in the twenty-fourth (asterism?).\' In neither of these\nauthorities, however, is it proposed by the last-cited passages to illustrate\nthe chronology of princes or dynasties: the specification p. 487 of the\nperiod, whatever it may be, is that of the era at which the evil influence of\nthe Kali age is to become most active and irresistible.\n\n[487:84](vp117.htm#fr_1436) The Bhagavata has the same. Devapi, as the\ncommentator observes, being the restorer of the lunar, and Maru of the solar\nrace.\n\n[489:85](vp117.htm#fr_1437) To be the cause of Sankalpa, \'conviction,\'\n\'belief;\' and Vikalpa, \'doubt,\' \'disbelief.\' The Bhagavata indulges in a\nsimilar strain, and often in the same words. The whole recalls the words of\nthe Roman satirist;\n\n. . . I, demens, et saevas curre per Alpes,  \nUt pueris placeas, et declamatio fias.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter I](vp118.htm)\n\n'
