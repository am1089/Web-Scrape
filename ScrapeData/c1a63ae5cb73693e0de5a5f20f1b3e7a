Or, if they are of the nature of that which is knowledge and so on, there\nis no contradiction to that (i.e. the Bhagavata doctrine).\n\nThe \'or\' sets aside the view previously maintained. By \'that which is\nknowledge and so on\' 1 we have to understand the highest Brahman. If Sa _n_\nkarsha _n_ a, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha are of the nature of the highest\nBrahman, then truly there can be no objection to a body of doctrine\n\np. 525\n\nwhich sets forth this relation. The criticism that the Bhagavatas teach an\ninadmissible origination of the individual soul, is made by people who do not\nunderstand that system. What it teaches is that the highest Brahman, there\ncalled Vasudeva, from kindness to those devoted to it, voluntarily abides in a\nfourfold form, so as to render itself accessible to its devotees. Thus it is\nsaid in the Paushkara-sa _m_ hita, \'That which enjoins that Brahma _n_ as have\nto worship, under its proper names, the fourfold nature of the Self; that is\nthe authoritative doctrine.\' That this worship of that which is of a fourfold\nnature means worship of the highest Brahman, called Vasudeva, is declared in\nthe Satvata-sa _m_ hita, \'This is the supreme _s_ astra, the great\nBrahmopanishad, which imparts true discrimination to Brahmawas worshipping the\nreal Brahman under the name of Vasudeva.\' That highest Brahman, called\nVasudeva, having for its body the complete aggregate of the six qualities,\ndivides itself in so far as it is either the \'Subtle\' (sukshma), or \'division\'\n(vyuha), or \'manifestation\' (vibhava), and is attained in its fulness by the\ndevotees who, according to their qualifications, do worship to it by means of\nworks guided by knowledge. \'From the worship of the vibhava-aspect one attains\nto the vyuha, and from the worship of the vyuha one attains to the "Subtile"\ncalled Vasudeva, i.e. the highest Brahman\'--such is their doctrine. By the\n\'vibhava\' we have to understand the aggregate of beings, such as Rama, K _ri_\nshna, &c., in whom the highest Being becomes manifest; by the \'vyuha\' the\nfourfold arrangement or division of the highest Reality, as Vasudeva, Sa _n_\nkarsha _n_ a, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha; by the \'Subtle\' the highest Brahman\nitself, in so far as it has for its body the mere aggregate of the six\nqualities--as which it is called \'Vasudeva.\' Compare on this point the\nPaushkara, \'That body of doctrine through which, by means of works based on\nknowledge, one fully attains to the imperishable highest Brahman, called\nVasudeva,\' and so on, Sa _n_ karsha _n_ a, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha are thus\nmere bodily forms which the highest Brahman voluntarily assumes. Scripture\nalready declares, \'Not born he is born\n\np. 526\n\nin many ways,\' and it is this birth--consisting in the voluntary assumption of\nbodily form, due to tenderness towards its devotees--which the Bhagavata\nsystem teaches; hence there lies no valid objection to the authoritativeness\nof that system. And as Sa _n_ karsha _n_ a. Pradyumna, and Aniruddha are the\nbeings ruling over the individual souls, internal organs and organs of egoity,\nthere can be no objection to their being themselves denoted by those latter\nterms, viz. individual soul, and so on. The case is analogous to that of\nBrahman being designated, in some texts, by terms such as ether, breath, and\nthe like.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[524:1](sbe48245.htm#fr_39) Or \'by that which is knowledge and cause.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 43.
