If it be said (that a contradiction will result) with regard to words; we\nsay no, since beings originate from them (as appears) from perception and\ninference.\n\nWell then let us admit that there is no difficulty as far as sacrifices are\nconcerned, for the reason stated in the preceding Sutra. But another\ndifficulty presents itself with regard to the words of which the Veda\nconsists. For if Indra and the other gods are corporeal beings, it follows\nthat they are made up of parts and hence non-permanent. This implies either\nthat the Vedic words denoting them--not differing therein from common worldly\nwords such as Devadatta--are totally devoid of meaning during all those\nperiods which precede the origination of the beings called Indra and so on, or\nfollow on their destruction; or else that the Veda itself is non-permanent,\nnon-eternal.--This objection is not valid, the Sutra points out, for the\nreason that those beings, viz. Indra and so on, again and again originate from\nthe Vedic words. To explain. Vedic words, such as Indra and so on, do not,\nlike the word Devadatta and the like, denote, on the basis of convention, one\nparticular individual only: they rather denote by their own power particular\nspecies of beings, just as the word \'cow\' denotes a particular species of\nanimals. When therefore a special individual of the class called Indra has\nperished, the creator, apprehending from the Vedic word \'Indra\' which is\npresent to his mind the class characteristics of the beings denoted by that\nword, creates another Indra possessing\n\np. 332\n\nthose very same characteristics; just as the potter fashions a new jar, on the\nbasis of the word \'jar\' which is stirring in _his_ mind.--But how is this\nknown?--\'Through perception and inference,\' i.e. through Scripture and Sm _ri_\nti. Scripture says, e.g. \'By means of the Veda Pra _g_ apati evolved names and\nforms, the being and the non-being\'; and \'Saying "bhuh" (earth) he created the\nearth; saying "bhuva _h_ " he created the air,\' and so on; which passages\nteach that the creator at first bethinks himself of the characteristic make of\na thing, in connexion with the word denoting it, and thereupon creates an\nindividual thing characterised by that make. Sm _ri_ ti makes similar\nstatements; compare, e.g. \'In the beginning there was sent forth by the\ncreator, divine speech--beginningless and endless--in the form of the Veda,\nand from it there originated all creatures\'; and \'He, in the beginning,\nseparately created from the words of the Veda the names and works and shapes\nof all things\'; and \'The names and forms of beings, and all the multiplicity\nof works He in the beginning created from the Veda.\' This proves that from the\ncorporeality of the gods, and so on, it follows neither that the words of the\nVeda are unmeaning nor that the Veda itself is non-eternal.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 28.
