For the same reason also during the southern progress of the sun.\n\nThe reasoning stated above also proves that the owner of true knowledge who\nmay happen to die during the southern progress of the sun reaches Brahman. A\nfurther doubt, however, arises here. The text 'He who dies during the sun's\nsouthern progress reaches the greatness of the Fathers and union with the\nmoon' (Mahanar. Up. 25) declares that he who dies during the southern progress\nreaches the moon; and the other text 'when this ceases they return again the\nsame way' (B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 16) states that he returns again to the earth.\nWe further know that Bhishma and others, although fully possessing the\nknowledge of Brahman, put off their death until the beginning of the northern\nprogress. All this seems to prove that he who dies during the southern\nprogress does not reach Brahman.--This doubt we dispose of as follows. Those\nonly who do not possess true knowledge return from the moon; while he who has\nsuch knowledge does not return even after he has gone to the moon. For a\ncomplementary clause in the Mahanaraya _n_ a Up., 'from there he reaches the\ngreatness of Brahman,' shows that the abode in the moon forms for him, who\nhaving died during the southern progress wishes to reach Brahman, a mere stage\nof rest. And even if there were no such complementary passage, it would follow\nfrom the previously stated absence of any\n\np. 742\n\nreason for bondage that the going of the wise man's soul to the moon in no way\nprecludes his reaching Brahman. Bhishma and others who through the power of\nYoga were able to choose the time of their death put it off until the\nbeginning of the northern progress in order to proclaim before the world the\nexcellence of that season and thus to promote pious faith and practice.--But\nwe also meet with an authoritative statement made with reference to wise men\nabout to die, as to difference of time of death being the cause of a man\neither returning or not returning to this world, 'I will declare at which time\nthe Yogins departing return not, and also the time at which they return. The\nsire, the light, the day, the bright fortnight, the six months of the sun's\nnorthern progress--the knowers of Brahman departing there go to Brahman. The\nsmoke, the night, the dark fortnight, the six months of the southern progress\n--the Yogin departing there having reached the light of the moon returns\nagain. These are held to be the perpetual paths of the world--the white and\nthe black; by the one man goes not to return, by the other he returns again'\n(Bha. Gi. VIII, 23-26).--To this point the next Sutra refers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 20. And those two paths are ... to be remembered](sbe48536.htm)\n\n"
