He\ndesired, 'May I exist, may I be generated.' He wearied himself and performed\nfervid devotions: from him, thus wearied and heated, the three worlds were\ncreated--the earth, the air, and the sky.\n\n11:5:8:22\\. He heated these three worlds, and from them, thus heated, three\nlights ( _g_ yotis) were produced--Agni (the fire), he who blows here (Vayu),\nand Surya (the sun).\n\n11:5:8:33\\. He heated these three lights, and from them, thus heated, the\nthree Vedas were produced--the _Ri_ g-veda from Agni, the Ya _g_ ur-veda from\nVayu, and the Sama-veda from Surya.\n\n11:5:8:44\\. He heated these three Vedas, and from them, thus heated, three\nluminous essences 1 were produced--\n\np. 103\n\n[paragraph continues] 'bhu _h_ ' from the _Ri_ g-veda, 'bhuva _h_ ' from the\nYa _g_ ur-veda, and 'svar' from the Sama-veda. And with the _Ri_ g-veda they\nthen performed the work of the Hot _ri_ priest, with the Ya _g_ ur-veda the\nwork of the Adhvaryu, and with the Sama-veda the work of the Udgat _ri_ ; and\nwhat luminous essence 1 there was in the threefold science, therewith the work\nof the Brahman priest then proceeded.\n\n11:5:8:55\\. The gods spake unto Pra _g_ apati, 'If our sacrifice were to fail\nin respect of either the _Ri_ _k_ , or the Ya _g_ us, or the Saman, whereby\nshould we heal it?'\n\n11:5:8:66\\. He spake, 'If (it were to fail) in respect of the _Ri_ _k_ , ye\nshould take ghee by four ladlings and offer it in the Garhapatya fire with\n'Bhu _h_!' and if in respect of the Ya _g_ us, ye should take ghee by four\nladlings and offer it in the \xc3\x82gnidhriya--or in the Anvaharyapa _k_ ana 2 in\nthe case of a Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a--with 'Bhuva _h_!' and if in respect of the\nSaman, ye should take ghee by four ladlings and offer it in the \xc3\x82havaniya with\n'Svar!' But if it should not be known (where the mistake has occurred), ye\nshould make offering in the \xc3\x82havaniya after uttering\n\np. 104\n\nrapidly all (the three sacred words 1): thus one heals the _Ri_ g-veda by the\n_Ri_ g-veda 2, the Ya _g_ ur-veda by the Ya _g_ ur-veda, and the Sama-veda by\nthe Sama-veda;--even as one would put together joint with joint 3, so does he\nput together (the broken part of the sacrifice) whoever heals it by means of\nthese (three sacred words). But if he heals it in any other way than this, it\nwould be just as if one tried to put together something that is broken with\nsomething else that is broken, or as if one were to apply some poison as\nlotion to a broken part 4. Let him therefore appoint only one who knows this\n(to officiate as) his Brahman, and not one who does not know this.\n\n11:5:8:77\\. As to this they say, 'Seeing that the work of the Hot _ri_ is\nperformed with the _Ri_ g-veda, that of the Adhvaryu with the Ya _g_ ur-veda,\nand that of the Udgat _ri_ with the Sama-veda, wherewith then is the work of\nthe Brahman (performed)?' Let him reply, 'With that threefold science.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[102:1](sbe44032.htm#fr_330) ? Saya _n_ a takes ' _s_ ukra' here in the sense\nof 'flame, light' (vyah _ri_ tirupa _n_ i te _g_ a _m_ si); whilst the St.\nPetersb. Dict. assigns to it the meaning of 'sap, juice' (Saft, Seim, cf. next\nnote). Ait. Br. V, 32, contains a very similar passage in which the same\nprocess of evolution is set forth:--Pra _g_ apati first creates the three\nworlds, earth, air, and heaven. From them, being heated by him, three lights (\n_g_ yotis) are produced--Agni from the earth, Vayu from the air, and \xc3\x82ditya\nfrom the sky (or heaven). From them, being heated, the three Vedas are\nproduced--the _Ri_ g-veda from Agni, the Ya _g_ ur-veda from Vayu, and the\nSama-veda from \xc3\x82ditya. From the Vedas, being heated, three flames ( _s_ ukra,\nluminaries, Haug) are produced--Bhu _h_ from the _Ri_ g-veda, Bhuva _h_ from\nthe Ya _g_ ur-veda, p. 103 and Svar from the Sama-veda. From these in the same\nway are produced three sounds (or letters, var _n_ a), a, u and m, which being\ncombined yield the syllable 'Om.' Cp. J. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, vol.\niii, p. 4.\n\n[103:1](sbe44032.htm#fr_331) Here Saya _n_ a also seems to take ' _s_ ukra' in\nthe sense of 'pure, essential part'--nirmala _m_ rupa _m_ saratvata _m_ _s_ a\n_h_ (!).\n\n[103:2](sbe44032.htm#fr_332) That is, the Dakshi _n_ agni. At the Havirya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a (of which class of sacrifices, performed in the Pra _k_ inava _m_ _s_ a\nhall, the full and new moon serves as model) there is no \xc3\x82gnidhriya, which is,\nhowever, required for the Soma-sacrifice. See the plan in part ii, p. 475.\n\n[104:1](sbe44032.htm#fr_333) According to Saya _n_ a, offering would be used\nwith the formula 'Bhur bhuva _h_ sva _h_ , svaha!'\n\n[104:2](sbe44032.htm#fr_334) Viz. by the word 'bhu _h_ ,' representing that\nVeda.\n\n[104:3](sbe44032.htm#fr_335) Yatha khalu loke bhagna _m_ hastapadadiparva\ntatsannihitenanyena parva _n_ a purushaya sa _m_ dadhyat sa _m_ _s_ leshayet,\nevam evanena vyah _ri_ ti _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anena tat tad avedokta _m_ prabh _ri_ sh _t_\nam a\xe1\xb9\x85ga _m_ puna _h_ sahita _m_ bhavati, Say.\n\n[104:4](sbe44032.htm#fr_336) ? Or, as if one were to put some fluid into some\nbroken (vessel; or, on some broken part),--yatha _s_ ir _n_ ena bhagnena anya\n_k_ _kh_ ir _n_ a _m_ bhagna _m_ vastu sa _m_ dhitset sa _m_ dhatum i _k_ _kh_\net; yatha va _s_ ir _n_ e gara _m_ bhaktavayave garam abhinidadhyat pra _h_\ndattipeta (? prakshipet), Say.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 5, 9.
