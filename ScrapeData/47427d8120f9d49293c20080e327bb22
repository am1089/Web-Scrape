Now, Bh _ri_ gu, the son of Varu _n_ a, deemed himself superior to\nhis father Varu _n_ a in knowledge 3. Varu _n_ a became aware of this: \'He\ndeems himself superior to me in knowledge,\' he thought.\n\n11:6:1:22\\. He said, \'Go thou eastward, my boy; and\n\np. 109\n\nhaving seen there what thou shalt see, go thou southwards; and having seen\nthere what thou shalt see, go thou westward; and having seen there what thou\nshalt see, go thou northward; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go\nthou toward the northern of those two intermediate quarters in front 1, and\ntell me then what thou shalt see there.\'\n\n11:6:1:33\\. He then went forth from thence eastward, and lo, men were\ndismembering men 2, hewing off their limbs one by one, and saying, \'This to\nthee, this to me!\' He said, \'Horrible! woe is me! men here have dismembered\nmen, hewing off their limbs one by one!\' They replied, \'Thus, indeed, these\ndealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in return.\' He\nsaid, \'Is there no atonement for this?\'--\'Yes, there is,\' they replied.--\'What\nis it?\'--\'Thy father knows.\'\n\n11:6:1:44\\. He went forth from thence southward, and lo, men were dismembering\nmen, cutting up their limbs one by one, and saying, \'This to thee, this to\nme!\' He said, \'Horrible! woe is me! men here have dismembered men, cutting up\ntheir limbs one by one!\' They replied, \'Thus, indeed, these dealt with us in\nyonder world, and so we now deal with them in return.\' He said, \'Is there no\natonement for this?\'--\'Yes, there is,\' they replied.--\'What is it?\'--\'Thy\nfather knows.\'\n\np. 110\n\n11:6:1:55\\. He went forth from thence westward, and lo, men, sitting still,\nwere being eaten by men, sitting still! He said, \'Horrible! woe is me! men,\nsitting still, are eating men, sitting still!\' They replied, \'Thus, indeed,\nthese have dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in\nreturn.\' He said, \'Is there no atonement for this? Yes, there is,\' they\nreplied.--\'What is it? Thy father knows.\'\n\n11:6:1:66\\. He went forth from thence northward, and lo, men, crying aloud,\nwere being eaten by men, crying aloud! He said, \'Horrible! woe is me! men,\ncrying aloud, here are eating men, crying aloud!\' They replied, \'Thus, indeed,\nthese dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in return.\'\nHe said, \'Is there no atonement for this?\'--\'Yes, there is,\' they\nreplied.--\'What is it? Thy father knows.\'\n\n11:6:1:77\\. He went forth from thence toward the northern of those two\nintermediate quarters in front, and lo, there were two women, one beautiful,\none over-beautiful 1: between them stood a man, black, with yellow eyes, and a\nstaff in his hand. On seeing him, terror seized him, and he went home, and sat\ndown. His father said to him, \'Study thy day\'s lesson (of scripture): why dost\nthou not, study thy lesson?\' He said, What am I to study? there is nothing\nwhatever.\' Then Varu _n_ a knew, \'He has indeed seen it!\n\n11:6:1:88\\. He spake, \'As to those men whom thou\n\np. 111\n\nsawest in the eastern region being dismembered by men hewing off their limbs\none by one, and saying, "This to thee, this to me!" they were the trees: when\none puts fire-wood from trees on (the fire) he subdues the trees, and conquers\nthe world of trees.\n\n11:6:1:99\\. \'And as to those men whom thou sawest in the southern region being\ndismembered by men cutting up their limbs one by one, and saying, "This to\nthee, this to me!" they were the cattle; when one makes offering with milk he\nsubdues the cattle, and conquers the world of cattle.\n\n11:6:1:1010\\. \'And as to those men thou sawest in the western region who,\nwhilst sitting still, were being eaten by men sitting still, they were the\nherbs: when one illumines (the Agnihotra milk) with a straw 1, he subdues the\nherbs, and conquers the world of herbs.\n\n11:6:1:1111\\. \'And as to those men thou sawest in the northern region who,\nwhilst crying aloud, were being eaten by men crying aloud, they were the\nwaters: when one pours water to (the Agnihotra milk), he subdues the waters,\nand conquers the world of waters.\n\n11:6:1:1212\\. \'And as to those two women whom thou sawest, one beautiful and\none over-beautiful,--the beautiful one is Belief: when one offers the first\nlibation (of the Agnihotra) he subdues Belief, and conquers Belief; and the\nover-beautiful one is Unbelief: when one offers the second libation, he\nsubdues Unbelief, and conquers Unbelief.\n\n11:6:1:1313\\. \'And as to the black man with yellow eyes,\n\np. 112\n\nwho was standing between them with a staff in his hand, he was Wrath: when,\nhaving poured water into the spoon, one pours (the libation into the fire), he\nsubdues Wrath, and conquers Wrath; and, verily, whosoever, knowing this,\noffers the Agnihotra, thereby conquers everything, and subdues everything.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[108:3](sbe44034.htm#fr_347) On this legend, see Prof. Weber, Indische\nStreifen, I, p. 24 seqq., where the scenes here depicted are taken to be\nreflections of the popular belief of the time as to the punishments awaiting\nthe guilty in a future existence.\n\n[109:1](sbe44034.htm#fr_348) That is to say, in the north-easterly direction.\nProf. Weber seems to take it in the sense of the northern one of the two\nregions intermediate between the two (regions) first referred to. This,\nhowever, makes no sense.\n\n[109:2](sbe44034.htm#fr_349) I think, with Prof. Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, p.\n404, that the instrumental \'purushai _h_ \' stands in lieu of the accusative;\nthis construction being adopted in order to avoid the double accusative and\nconsequent ambiguity.\n\n[110:1](sbe44034.htm#fr_350) According to Saya _n_ a \'ati-kalya _n_ i\' means\n\'not beautiful (a _s_ obhana), ugly.\' Perhaps its real meaning is \'one of past\nbeauty,\' one whose beauty has faded.\n\n[111:1](sbe44034.htm#fr_351) See II, 3, 1, 16.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 6, 2.
