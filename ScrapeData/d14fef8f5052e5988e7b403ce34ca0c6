Should it be said that (the former reply refers) to that Self to which\nthe aggregate of material things belongs (since) otherwise the difference (of\nthe two replies) could not be accounted for; we say--no; as in the case of\ninstruction\n\np. 655\n\nIn the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka (III, 4; 5) the same question is asked twice in\nsuccession ('Tell me the Brahman which is visible, not invisible, the Self who\nis within all'), while Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya gives a different answer to each ('He\nwho breathes in the upbreathing,' &c.; 'He who overcomes hunger and thirst,'\n&c.). The question here is whether the two meditations, suggested by these\nsections, are different or not. They are different,since the difference of\nreply effects a distinction between the two vidyas. The former reply declares\nhim who is the maker of breathing forth, and so on to be the inner Self of\nall; the latter describes him as free from hunger, thirst, and so on. It\nthence appears that the former passage refers to the inner (individual) Self\nwhich is different from body, sense-organs, internal organ and vital breath;\nwhile the latter refers to that which again differs from the inner Self, viz.\nthe highest Self, free from hunger, thirst, and so on. As the individual soul\nis inside the aggregate of material things, it may be spoken of as being that\ninner Self of all. Although this kind of inwardness is indeed only a relative\none, we nevertheless must accept it in this place; for if, desirous of taking\nthis 'being the inner Self of all' in its literal sense, we assumed the\nhighest Self to be meant, the difference of the two replies could not be\naccounted for. The former reply evidently refers to the individual soul, since\nthe highest Self cannot be conceived as breathing forth, and so on; and the\nlatter reply, which declares the Self to be raised above hunger, &c.,\nevidently refers to the highest Self. This is expressed in the earlier part of\nthe Sutra: 'The former reply refers to the Self to which there belongs the\naggregate of material things, i.e. the individual soul as being the inner Self\nof all; otherwise we could not account for the difference of the two replies.'\n--The last words of the Sutra negative this--'not so,' i.e. there is no\ndifference of vidyas, since both assertions and replies refer to the highest\nSelf. The question says in both places, 'the Brahman which is visible, not\ninvisible, the Self who is within all,' and this clearly refers to the highest\nSelf only. We indeed observe that in some places the term _Brahman\n\n_\n\np. 656\n\nis, in a derived sense, applied to the individual soul also; but the text\nunder discussion, for distinction's sake, adds the qualification 'the Brahman\nwhich is manifest' ( _s_ akshat). The quality of ' aparokshatva' (i.e. being\nthat which does not transcend the senses but lies openly revealed) also, which\nimplies being connected with all space and all time, suits Brahman only, which\nfrom texts such as 'the True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman' is known to be\ninfinite. In the same way the attribute of being the inner Self of all can\nbelong to the highest Self only, which texts such as 'He who dwelling within\nthe earth,' &c., declare to be the inner ruler of the universe. The replies to\nthe two questions likewise can refer to Brahman only. The unconditional causal\nagency with regard to breath, declared in the clause 'he who breathes in the\nupbreathing,' &c., can belong to the highest Self only, not to the individual\nsoul, since the latter possesses no such causal power when in the state of\ndeep sleep. Ushasta thereupon, being not fully enlightened, since causality\nwith regard to breathing may in a sense be attributed to the individual soul\nalso, again asks a question, in reply to which Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya clearly\nindicates Brahman, 'Thou mayest not see the seer of sight,' &c., i.e. thou\nmust not think that my previous speech has named as the causal agent of\nbreathing the individual soul, which is the causal agent with regard to those\nactivities which depend on the sense-organs, viz. seeing, hearing, thinking,\nand knowing; for in the state of deep sleep, swoon, and so on, the soul\npossesses no such power. And moreover another text also--'Who could breathe if\nthat bliss existed not in the ether?' (Taitt. Up. II, 7)--declares that the\nhighest Self only is the cause of the breathing of all living beings. In the\nsame way the answer to the second question can refer to the highest Self only,\nwhich alone can be said to be raised above hunger, thirst, and so on. For this\nreason also both replies wind up with the same phrase, 'Everything else is of\nevil.' The iteration of question and reply serves the purpose of showing that\nthe same highest Brahman which is the cause of all breathing is beyond all\nhunger, thirst, and so on.--The\n\np. 657\n\n[paragraph continues] Sutra subjoins a parallel instance. 'As in the case of\ninstruction.' As in the vidya of that which truly is ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 1 ff.),\nquestion and reply are iterated several times, in order to set forth the\nvarious greatness and glory of Brahman.--Thus the two sections under\ndiscussion are of the same nature, in so far as setting forth that the one\nBrahman which is the inner Self of all is the cause of all life and raised\nbeyond all imperfections; and hence they constitute one meditation only.--To\nthis a new objection is raised. The two sections may indeed both refer to the\nhighest Brahman; nevertheless there is a difference of meditation, as\naccording to the one Brahman is to be meditated upon as the cause of all life,\nand according to the other as raised above all defects; this difference of\ncharacter distinguishes the two meditations. And further there is a difference\nof interrogators; the first question being asked by Ushasta, the second by\nKahola.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 36.
