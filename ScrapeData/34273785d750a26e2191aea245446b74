Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: Tell me, O Ke\xc5\x9bava, what good results follow from the\nperformance of the ten-days\' rite, and who should perform it if there is no\nson.\n\n2 The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, and I will tell you about the ten-\ndays\' ceremony; having done which, a good son is released from the hereditary\ndebt.\n\n3-8. The son, taking calm courage, should offer rice-balls to the father,\nrefraining from tears,\n\nBecause the departed has inevitably to drink the bitter tears let fall by his\nrelatives, and they should not weep when sorrow is useless.\n\nAlthough there be sorrowing day and night for thousands of years, the man who\nis dead may never be seen.\n\nDeath is certain for those who are born, and birth is certain for the dead.\nThis is inevitable and therefore a wise man should not grieve over it.\n\np. 98\n\nThere is no way out, either human or divine; the being who has come under the\nsway of death must be born again here.\n\nIf there were a way of averting the inevitable, then Nala, R\xc4\x81ma and\nYudi\xe1\xb9\xa3h\xe1\xb9\xadhira would not have experienced miseries.\n\n9-11. Nobody should form an excessive attachment to anybody; the body is only\na dream, what then of other persons\'?\n\nAs a traveller, resorting to some shady place, rests awhile and then departs\nagain; so is the coming together of beings.\n\nThe good things eaten in the morning are destroyed by evening; how can there\nbe permanence in a body which is sustained by these foods?\n\n12-17. Having considered this, which removes misery, and given up sorrow\narising from ignorance, the son should perform the rites.\n\nIf there is no son the wife, should perform them, and if no wife the brother;\nor a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87\'s pupil or a proper kinsman should perform them.\n\nThe ten-days\' ceremonies, for the man who has no son, should be performed by\nthe sons or grandsons of his younger or his elder brother, O Bird;\n\nManu declared that if, of brothers of the same father, only one has a son,\nthey are all considered, on account of that son, to have a son.\n\np. 99\n\nIf a man has several wives, but only one of them has a son, all of them have a\nson, on account of that son.\n\nFor all who have no sons a friend may offer the rice-balls. The rites\n[must](errata.htm#8) not be neglected. If there is nobody else, the family\npriest may do them.\n\n18\\. A man or a woman who performs the rites for a friend, by this sacrament\nfor the helpless departed, obtains the fruit of tens of millions of\nsacrifices.\n\n19-21. The ten-days\' ceremony for the father should be performed by the son, O\nBird. Even if the eldest son dies, the father should not, through excessive\naffection, perform it.\n\nAlthough there be many sons, only one shall perform the ten-days\' ceremony,\nthe rice-ball offerings, and the other sixteen \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddhas,--\n\nOnly by one these ceremonies, even if the wealth has been divided. But the\nannual \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha should be performed severally if the wealth has been divided.\n\n22-24. Therefore should the eldest son perform with devotion the ten-days\'\nceremony, 1 eating one meal, sleeping on the ground, devoted to Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87, 2 and\npure.\n\nThe son obtains such fruit from the performance of the rite for the father and\nmother, as is obtained by going round the shrines seven times.\n\np. 100\n\nThe son who performs the rites for one year, beginning with the ten-days\'\nceremony, obtains such fruit as is acquired by performing the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha at Gay\xc4\x81.\n\n25-30. Having gone to a well or a tank, in a garden, at a sacred bathing-\nplace, or in a temple, between nine and twelve noon, he should bathe without\nreciting mantras.\n\nBeing purified, seated facing southward at the root of a tree, he should make\nan altar 1 there, cleansed with cow-dung.\n\nHe should place on it, over leaves, a twice-born 2 made of darbha and ku\xc5\x9ba\ngrasses, and having worshipped it with water for the feet and other things,\nshould bow to it, saying the "Atas\xc4\xab."\n\nThen having spread ku\xc5\x9ba grass in front of it, as a seat for the rice-ball, and\nhaving placed upon it a ball prepared in the family-name of the departed,\n\nMade of cooked rice or of barley meal,--the son should make the offering. He\nshould dedicate Us\xc4\xabra-root; sandal paste, the flowers of the Bh\xe1\xb9\x9bi\xe1\xb9\x85gar\xc4\x81ja,\nincense, a lamp, eatables, mouth-perfumes and presents.\n\nCrow-food, milk and water, and handfuls of castor-oil in a pot: "May all this,\nthat has been given by me to the departed in his earthly name, persist."\n\np. 101\n\n31-33. Food, cloths, water, wealth or other things, if given in the name of\nthe departed, confer eternity upon the dead.\n\nTherefore, from the first day onwards, one should pronounce the name of the\ndeparted woman or man, in accordance with the sapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8da rite.\n\n33\\. In the same way that on the first day a rice-ball is given as prescribed,\nso should the nine rice-balls be given.\n\n34-36. On the ninth day all the authorised kinsmen at the proper time should\nbesmear themselves with oil, wishing the dead to reach heaven.\n\nHaving bathed in the open, taking with them panic grass and parched grain, and\nhaving the women go in front, they should proceed to the place of the dead,\n\nAnd say: "May his family increase like the panic grass, and radiate like the\nparched grain," and then leave in the house the mixed-panic grass and grain.\n\n37-38. On the tenth day a ball of flesh should be given, O Lord of Birds, or a\nball of m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xa3a, since flesh is forbidden in the Kali Yuga at the ceremony for\nthe forefathers.\n\nOn the tenth day he should shave, as also should the other relatives. The son\nwho performs the ceremony must again have a complete shave.\n\np. 102\n\n39\\. During the ten days he should feed a twice-born with seasoned foods.\nHaving meditated upon Hari, he should, with hands together, pray for the\nrelease of the departed.\n\n40\\. There is no reason for fear for those who bow to Govinda, the Eternal,\nclad in yellow robes, as beautiful as the atas\xc4\xab flower.\n\n41-42. "O Beginningless and Endless Deva, O Bearer of the conch, discus and\nmace, Indestructible, Lotus-eyed, be Thou the giver of release to the\ndeparted."\n\nEvery day at the conclusion of the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha he should prayerfully repeat this\nincantation. Having bathed, gone home, and given food to the cow, he may eat.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[99:1](gpu13.htm#fr_115) One each day.\n\n[99:2](gpu13.htm#fr_116) Celibate.\n\n[100:1](gpu13.htm#fr_117) A square flat mound a few inches high.\n\n[100:2](gpu13.htm#fr_118) A rough image, symbolical of the deceased twice-born\nperson.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XII.
