[1](ry325.htm#fn_753)  \nPure votaress she shone with light  \nOf fervent zeal and holy rite.  \nThen Hanumanre the rest  \nWith reverent words the dame addressed:  \n'Who art thou? say: and who is lord  \nOf this vast cave with treasures stored?'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LI.: Svayamprabha](ry325.htm)\n\n"
