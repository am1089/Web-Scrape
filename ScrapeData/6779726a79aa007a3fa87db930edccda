Wilkins, [1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 17\n\n### CHAPTER IV.\n\n#### ADITI, AND THE \xc4\x80DITYAS.\n\nAditi has the honour of being almost the only goddess mentioned by name in the\nRig-Veda, as the mother of any of the gods; but it is by no means an easy task\nto delineate her character, as the most contradictory statements are made\nconcerning her. She was invoked as the bestower of blessings on children and\ncattle; and she is declared to be the mother of Varuna, and other deities,\nsometimes eight, sometimes twelve in number. She is supposed to be the\nimpersonation of "infinity, especially the boundlessness of heaven, in\nopposition to the finiteness of earth." Another supposition is that Aditi is\nthe personification of "universal, all-embracing Nature or Being." This latter\nidea seems to be the more correct from the following verses, * where a man\nabout to be immolated says, "Of which god, now, of which of the immortals,\nshall we invoke the amiable name, who shall give us back to the great Aditi,\nthat I may behold my father and my mother?" Whatever may have been intended by\nthe poets to be expressed by this name, or whatever may have been the precise\npower personified by Aditi, she is connected with the forgiveness of sin.\nThus, "May Aditi make us sinless." "Aditi be gracious, if we have committed\nany sin against you." "Whatever\n\np. 18\n\noffence we have, oh Agni, through our folly committed against you, oh most\nyouthful god, make us free from sins against Aditi." "Whatever sin we have\ncommitted, may Aditi sever us from it." * Probably the term Aditi "the\nboundless," was originally employed as an epithet of Dyauspitar, the Heaven-\nfather. When the heavens came to be divided into a number of parts, over each\nof which a ruler was nominated, a mother was wanted for them, and the name\nAditi was given to her.\n\nIn the account of the Creation given in the Rig-Veda, Aditi is said to have\nsprung from Daksha, and in the same verse Daksha is called her son. There is\nalso a reference to her other sons. In the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" we have no less\nthan three somewhat differing accounts of the origin of Daksha the father of\nAditi. In the first account, his name appears amongst the mind-born sons of\nBrahm\xc4\x81; and in this connection he is said to have had twenty-four daughters;\nbut Aditi is not mentioned as one of them. In the second account of Daksha,\nAditi is said to have been one of his sixty daughters, and was given in\nmarriage to Kasypa, by whom she had twelve sons--the \xc4\x80dityas. Elsewhere we\nread that Vishnu, when incarnate as the Dwarf, was a result of this marriage.\nIn the third account of Daksha, Aditi is again mentioned as his daughter, and\nthe mother of Vivasat (the Sun). The sons of Aditi are termed\n\n##### THE \xc4\x80DITYAS.\n\nThis name signifies simply the descendants of Aditi. In one passage in the\nRig-Veda \xe2\x80\xa0 the names of six are given: Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, Varuna, Daksha\nand Amsa. In another passage they are said to be seven in\n\np. 19\n\nnumber, though their names are not given. In a third, eight is the number\nmentioned; but "of the eight sons of Aditi, who were born from her body, she\napproached the gods with seven, and cast out M\xc4\x81rtt\xc4\x81nda (the eighth)." * As the\nnames of these sons given in different parts of the Vedas do not agree with\neach other, it is difficult to know who were originally regarded as \xc4\x80dityas.\nJudging from the number of hymns addressed to them, some of these deities\noccupied a conspicuous position in the Vedic Pantheon; whilst others are named\nonce or twice only, and then in connection with their more illustrious\nbrethren. In the "Satapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana," and the Pur\xc4\x81nas, the number of the\n\xc4\x80dityas is increased to twelve. In addition to the six whose names are given\nabove, the following are also described in some hymns of the Rig-Veda as the\noffspring of Aditi: Surya, "as an \xc4\x80ditya identified with Agni, is said to have\nbeen placed by the gods in the sky;" \xe2\x80\xa0 Savitri, and Indra too, are in one\npassage addressed as an \xc4\x80ditya along with Varuna and the Moon. In the\nTaittiriya Texts, the following are described as \xc4\x80dityas:--Mitra, Varuna,\nAryaman, Amsu, Bhaga, Indra, and Vivasvat (Surya).\n\nProfessor Roth says \xe2\x80\xa1 of these deities, "In the highest heaven dwell and reign\nthose gods who bear in common the name of \xc4\x80dityas. We must, however, if we\nwould discover their earliest character, abandon the conceptions which in a\nlater age, and even in that of the heroic poems, were entertained regarding\nthese deities. According to this conception they were twelve Sun-gods, there\nbeing evident reference to the twelve months. But for the most ancient period\nwe must hold fast to the primary significance of their names. They are\n\np. 20\n\ninviolable, imperishable, eternal things. Aditi, Eternity, or The Eternal, is\nthe element which sustains them, or is sustained by them. The eternal and\ninviolable element in which the \xc4\x80dityas dwell, and which forms their essence,\nis the celestial light. The \xc4\x80dityas, the gods of this light, do not therefore\nby any means coincide with any of the forms in which light is manifested in\nthe universe. They are neither the sun, nor moon, nor stars, nor dawn, but the\neternal sustainers of this luminous life, which exists, as it were, behind\nthese phenomena."\n\nAs noticed above, the text of the Rig-Veda says, * "Of the eight sons who were\nborn from the body of Aditi, she approached the gods with seven, but cast away\nthe eighth." In the commentary, the following explanation of this circumstance\nis given. "The eighth son was deformed. His brothers, seeing his deformity,\nimproved his appearance. He was afterwards known as Vivasvat (the Sun). From\nthe superfluous flesh cut off his body an elephant was formed, hence the\nproverb, Let no man catch an elephant, for the elephant partakes of the nature\nof man.\'"\n\nAccording to a passage quoted in Chapter II. \xe2\x80\xa0 from the "Satapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana,"\nAgni, Indra, and Surya, obtained superiority over the other gods by means of\nsacrifice. By whatever means this position was obtained, it is certain that\nthey were the most popular deities of the Vedic Age. Agni stands in a class by\nhimself; but with Indra and Surya there are other deities closely associated,\nand possessing very similar attributes. Nearly the whole of the more\nconspicuous Vedic deities may be classified as follows:--(1) Agni, the god of\nFire; (2) Sun Gods, or gods of Light; and (3) Storm Gods, or those associated\nwith Indra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[17:*](hmvp08.htm#fr_12) Muir, O.
