At the\nend of the time, the Lord appeared before him in the form of a boar. He said:\n"Rise, rise and choose your boon." The sage got up and having prostrated\nhimself before him said: "O Lord, I will not, in my dream, wish of thee those\nthings that are desired by the worldly. All the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras, I\xe1\xb9\xadih\xc4\x81sas 2 and\nall the hosts of other sciences, as well as Brahma and all the other \xe1\xb8\x8cevas,\nspeak of emancipation as resulting from a knowledge of thy nature. So impart\nto me that science of Brahman which treats of thy nature."\n\nThen the boar-shaped Bhagav\xc4\x81n (Lord) said: "Some disputants hold that there\nare twenty-four \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas (principles) and some thirty-six, whilst others\nmaintain that there are ninety-six. I shall relate them in their order. Listen\nwith an attentive mind. The organs of sense are five, _viz_.: ear, skin, eye\nand others. The organs of action are five, _viz_.: mouth, hand, leg and\nothers. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as (vital airs) are five; 3 sound and others ( _viz_., rudimentary\nprinciples) are five. 4 Manas, bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada and aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra are four; 5 thus\n\np. 221\n\nthose that know Brahman know these to be the twenty-four \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas. Besides\nthese, the wise hold the quintuplicated elements to be five, _viz_.: earth,\nwater, fire, v\xc4\x81yu and \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b; the bodies to be three, _viz_.: the gross, the\nsubtle and the k\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87a or causal; the states of consciousness to be three,\n_viz_.: the waking, the dreaming and the dreamless sleeping. The munis know\nthe total collection of \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas to be thirty-six (coupled with j\xc4\xabva).\n\n"With these \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas, there are six changes, _viz_.: existence, birth, growth,\ntransformation, decay and destruction. Hunger, thirst, grief, delusion, old\nage and death are said to be the six infirmities. Skin, blood, flesh, fat,\nmarrow and bones are said to be the six sheaths. Passion, anger, avarice,\ndelusion, pride and malice are the six kinds of foes. Vi\xc5\x9bva, \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa and\nPr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a 1 are the three aspects of the j\xc4\xabva. Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva, rajas and \xe1\xb9\xadamas are the\nthree gu\xe1\xb9\x87as (qualities). Pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha, 2 sa\xc3\xb1chi\xe1\xb9\xada and \xc4\x81g\xc4\x81min are the three\nkarmas. Talking, lifting, walking, excreting and enjoying are the five actions\n(of the organs of action); and there are also thought, certainty, egoism,\ncompassion, memory (functions of manas, etc.,), complacency, sympathy and\nindifference: \xe1\xb8\x8dik (the quarters), V\xc4\x81yu, Sun, Varu\xe1\xb9\x87a, 3 A\xc5\x9bvini \xe1\xb8\x8devas, 4 Agni,\nIn\xe1\xb8\x8dra, Upen\xe1\xb8\x8dra, 5 and M\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadyu (death): and then the moon, the four-faced Brahma,\nRu\xe1\xb8\x8dra, Kshe\xe1\xb9\xadraj\xc3\xb1a, 6 and \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara. Thus these are the ninety-six \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas. Those\nthat worship, with devotion, me of the form of boar, who am other than the\naggregate of these \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas and am without decay are released from aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and\nits effects and become j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xadas. Those that know these ninety-six \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas\nwill attain salvation in whatever order of life they may be, whether they have\nmatted hair or are of shaven head or have (only) their tuft of hair on. 7\nThere is no doubt of this. Thus ends the first chapter."\n\np. 222\n\n##### Chapter II\n\nThe great \xe1\xb9\x9abhu (again) addressed the Lord of Lakshm\xc4\xab of the form of boar thus:\n"O Lord, please initiate me into the supreme Brahmavi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 (or science)." Then\nthe Lord who removes the miseries of his devotees being thus questioned,\nanswered thus: "Through (the right observance of) the duties of one\'s own\ncaste and orders of life, through religious austerities and through the\npleasing of the guru (by serving him rightly), arise to persons the four,\nvair\xc4\x81gya, etc. They are the discrimination of the eternal from the non-\neternal; indifference to the enjoyments of this and the other worlds; the\nacquisition of the six virtues, \xc5\x9bama, 1 etc., and the longing after\nliberation. These should be practised. Having subdued the sensual organs and\nhaving given up the conception of \'mine\' in all objects, you should place your\nconsciousness of \'I\' in (or identify yourself with) me, who am the witness\nChai\xe1\xb9\xadanya (consciousness). To be born as a human being is difficult--more\ndifficult it is to be born as a male being--and more so is it to be born as a\nBrahman. Even then, if the fool does not cognise through the hearing, 2 etc.,\nof ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada, the true nature of the Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da (of Brahman) that is all-\npervading, and that is beyond all caste and orders of life, when will he\nobtain moksha? I alone am happiness. There is none other. If there is said to\nbe another, then it is not happiness. There is no such thing as love, except\non my account. The love that is on account of me is not natural to me. As I am\nthe seat of supreme love, that \'I am not\' is not. He who is sought after by\nall, saying "I should become such," is myself, the all-pervading. How can non-\nlight affect \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, the self-shining which is no other than the light whence\noriginates the words \'I am not light\'. My firm conviction is, whoever knows\nfor certain that (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) which is self-shining and has itself no basis (to rest\nupon), is one of vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na.\n\np. 223\n\n"The universe, j\xc4\xabva, \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara, m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 and others do not really exist, except my\nfull \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. I have not their characteristics. Karma which has \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 and other\nattributes and is of the form of darkness and aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is not fit to touch (or\naffect) me, who am \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, the self-resplendent. That man who sees (his) \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81\nwhich is all-witness and is beyond all caste and orders of life as of the\nnature of Brahman, becomes himself Brahman. Whoever sees, through the evidence\nof ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada, this visible universe as the Supreme Seat which is of the form of\nlight, attains moksha at once. When that knowledge which dispels the idea that\nthis body (alone) is \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, arises firmly in one\'s mind as was before the\nknowledge that this body (alone) is \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, then that person, even though he\ndoes not desire moksha, gets it. Therefore how will a person be bound by\nkarma, who always enjoys the bliss of Brahman which has the characteristics of\nSachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da, and which is other than aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na? Persons with spiritual eyes\nsee Brahman, that is the witness of the three states that has the\ncharacteristics of be-ness, wisdom and bliss, that is the underlying meaning\nof the words \'Thou\' (\xe1\xb9\xacvam) and \'I\' (Aham), and that is untouched by all the\nstains. As a blind man does not see the sun that is shining, so an ignorant\nperson does not see (Brahman). Praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na alone is Brahman. It has truth and\npraj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na as its characteristics. By thus cognising Brahman well, a person\nbecomes immortal. One who knows his own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as Brahman, that is bliss, and\nwithout duality and gu\xe1\xb9\x87as (qualities), and that is truth and absolute\nconsciousness is not afraid of anything. That which is consciousness alone\nwhich is all-pervading, which is eternal, which is all-full, which is of the\nform of bliss, and which is indestructible, is the only true Brahman. It is\nthe settled determination of Brahmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xabs that there _is_ naught else but\nthat. As the world appears dark to the blind and bright to those having good\neyes, so this world full of manifold miseries to the ignorant is full of\nhappiness to the wise. In me, of the form of boar, who am infinite and the\nBliss of absolute Consciousness, if there is the conception of non-dualism,\nwhere then is bondage? And who is the one to be emancipated? The real nature\nof all\n\np. 224\n\nembodied objects is ever the absolute Consciousness. Like the pot seen by the\neyes, the body and its aggregates are not ( _viz_., do not really exist).\nKnowing, as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma, all the locomotive and fixed worlds that appear as other\nthan \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, meditate upon them as \'It I am\'. Such a person then enjoys his real\nnature. There is no other to be enjoyed than one-Self. If there is anything\nthat is, then Brahman alone has that attribute. One who is perfect in\nBrahmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, though he always sees this established universe, does not see it\nother than his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. By cognising clearly my form, one is not trammelled by\nkarma. He is an undaunted person who by his own experience cognises as his own\nreal nature all (the universe and Brahman) that is without the body and the\norgans of sense--that is the all-witness--that is the one noumenal vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na,\nthat is the blissful \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (as contrasted with j\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 or the lower self) and\nthat is the self-resplendent. He is one that should be known as \'I\' (myself).\nO \xe1\xb9\x9abhu, may you become He. After this, there will be never any experience of\nthe world. Thereafter there will always be the experience of the wisdom of\none\'s own true nature. One who has thus known fully \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 has neither\nemancipation nor bondage. Whoever meditates, even for one muh\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\xada (48 minutes)\nthrough the cognition of one\'s own real form, upon Him who is dancing as the\nall-witness, is released from all bondage. Prostrations--prostrations to me\nwho am in all the elements, who am the Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 ( _viz_., \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 of the nature\nof wisdom) that is eternal and free and who am the Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. O \xe1\xb8\x8ceva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81, you\nare I. I am you. Prostrations on account of myself and yourself who are\ninfinite and who are Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, myself being the supreme \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9ba (Lord) and\nyourself being \xc5\x9aiva (of a beneficent nature). What should I do? Where should I\ngo? What should I reject? (Nothing, because) the universe is filled by me as\nwith the waters of the universal deluge. Whoever gives up (fond) love of the\nexternal, love of the internal and love of the body and thus gives up all\nassociations, is merged in me. There is no doubt about it. That Paramahamsa\n(ascetic) who, though living in the world, keeps aloof from human congregation\nas from serpent, who regards a beautiful woman as a (living)\n\np. 225\n\ncorpse and the endless sensual objects as poison, and who has abandoned all\npassion and is indifferent towards all objects is no other than V\xc4\x81su\xe1\xb8\x8deva, 1 (\n_viz_.,) myself. This is sa\xe1\xb9\xadya (truth). This is nothing but truth. It is truth\nalone that is now said. I am Brahman, the truth. There is naught else but I.\n\n"(The word) \'upav\xc4\x81sa\' (lit., dwelling near) signifies the dwelling near (or\nunion) of j\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and not (the religious observance as accepted\nby the worldy of) emaciating the body through fasts. To the ignorant, what is\nthe use of the mere drying up of the body? By beating about the hole of a\nsnake, can we be said to have killed the big snake within, A man is said to\nattain paroksha (indirect) wisdom when he knows (theoretically) that there is\nBrahman; but he is said to attain s\xc4\x81ksh\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadk\xc4\x81ra (direct cognition) when he knows\n(or realises) that he is himself Brahman. When a yogin knows his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 to be\nthe Absolute, then he becomes a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada. To mahatmas, to be always in the\nstate \'I am Brahman\' conduces to their salvation. There are two words for\nbondage and moksha. They are \'mine\' and \'not mine\'. Man is bound by \'mine\',\nbut he is released by \'not mine\'. He should abandon all the thoughts relating\nto externals and so also with reference to internals. O \xe1\xb9\x9abhu having given up\nall thoughts, you should rest content (in your \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) ever.\n\n"The whole of the universe is caused through sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa alone. It is only\nthrough sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa that the universe manifests. Having abandoned the universe,\nwhich is of the form of sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa and having fixed your mind upon the\nnirvikalpa (one which is changeless), meditate upon my abode in your heart. O\nmost intelligent being, pass your time in meditating upon me, glorifying me in\nsongs, talking about me to one another and thus devoting yourself entirely to\nme as the Supreme. Whatever is chi\xe1\xb9\xad (consciousness) in the universe is only\nChinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. This universe is Chinmaya only. You are Chi\xe1\xb9\xad. I am Chi\xe1\xb9\xad:\ncontemplate upon the worlds also as Chi\xe1\xb9\xad. Make the desires nil. Always be\nwithout any stain. How then can the bright lamp of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmic vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na\n\np. 226\n\narising through the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das be affected by the karma arising from the ignorance\nof the actor and the agent? Having given up not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and being in the world\nunaffected by it, delight only in the Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra within, ever intent on the\nOne. As the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b of the pot and that of the house are both located in the all-\npervading \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, so the j\xc4\xabvas and \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara are only evolved out of me, the\nChid\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b (the one \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b of universal consciousness). So that which did not\nexist before the evolution of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81s (j\xc4\xabvas and \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara) and that which is\nrejected at the end ( _viz_., universal deluge) is called m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 by Brahmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xabs\nthrough their discrimination. Should m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 and its effects (the universe) be\nannihilated, there is no state of \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara, there is no state of j\xc4\xabva. Therefore\nlike the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b without its vehicle, I am the immaculate and Chi\xe1\xb9\xad.\n\n"The creation, sentient as well as non-sentient from \xc4\xabksha\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 (thinking) to\nprave\xc5\x9ba (entry) (as stated in Chh\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb8\x8dogya-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d, Prap\xc4\x81thaka VI, Kha\xe1\xb9\x87das II\nand III) of those having the forms of j\xc4\xabvas and \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara is due to the creation\n(or illusion) of \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara; while the sams\xc4\x81ra (worldly existence) from the waking\nstate to salvation is due to the creation of j\xc4\xabva. So the karmas ordained in\nthe sacrifice (called) \xe1\xb9\xacri\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81chaka (so called after Nachike\xe1\xb9\xadas of Katha-\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d) to yoga are dependent upon the illusion of \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara; while (the\nsystems from) Lok\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xada (atheistical system) to s\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85khya rest on the illusion of\nj\xc4\xabva. Therefore aspirants after salvation should never make their heads enter\ninto the field of controversy regarding j\xc4\xabva and \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara. But with an\nundisturbed mind, the \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas of Brahman should be investigated. Those who do\nnot cognise the \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva of the secondless Brahman are all deluded persons only.\nWhence (then) is salvation to them? Whence then is happiness (to them) in this\nuniverse? What if they have the thoughts of the superiority and inferiority\n(of \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara and j\xc4\xabva)? Will sovereignty and mendicancy (experienced by a\nperson) in the dreaming state affect him in his waking state? When bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is\nabsorbed in aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, then it is termed, by the wise, sleep. Whence then is\nsleep to me who have not aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and its effects? When bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is in full bloom,\nthen it is said to be the j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xad (waking state).\n\np. 227\n\n[paragraph continues] As I have no changes, etc., there is no waking state to\nme. The moving about of bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi in the subtle n\xc4\x81dis constitutes the dreaming\nstate. In me without the act of moving about, there is no dreaming. Then at\nthe time of sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi when all things are absorbed, enveloped by \xe1\xb9\xadamas, he then\nenjoys the highest bliss of his own nature in an invisible state. If he sees\neverything as Chi\xe1\xb9\xad without any difference, he alone is an actual vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab. He\nalone is \xc5\x9aiva. He alone is Hari. He alone is Brahma. This mundane existence\nwhich is an ocean of sorrow, is nothing but a long-lived dream, or an illusion\nof the mind or a long-lived reign of the mind. From rising from sleep till\ngoing to bed, the one Brahman alone should be contemplated upon. By causing to\nbe absorbed this universe which is but a superimposition, the chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada partakes\nof my nature. Having annihilated all the six powerful enemies, through their\ndestruction become the non-dual One like the scent-elephant. Whether the body\nperishes now or lasts the age of moon and stars, what matters it to me having\nChi\xe1\xb9\xad alone as my body? What matters it to the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b in the pot, whether it (the\npot) is destroyed now or exists for a long time. While the slough of a serpent\nlies cast off lifeless in its hole, it (the serpent) does not evince any\naffection towards it. Likewise the wise do not identify themselves with their\ngross and subtle bodies. If the delusive knowledge (that the universe is real)\nwith its cause should be destroyed by the fire of \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, the wise man\nbecomes bodiless, through the idea \'It (Brahman) is not this; It is not this.\'\nThrough the study of \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras, the knowledge of reality (of the universe)\nperishes. Through direct perception of truth, one\'s fitness for action (in\nthis universe) ceases. With the cessation of pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha (the portion of the\npast karma which is being enjoyed in this life), the destruction of the\nmanifestation (of the universe) takes place. M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 is thus destroyed in a\nthreefold manner. If within himself no identification (of j\xc4\xabva) with Brahman\ntakes place, the state (of the separateness) of j\xc4\xabva does not perish. If the\nnon-dual one is truly discerned, then all affinities (for objects) cease. With\nthe cessation of pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha (arising from the cessation of\n\np. 228\n\naffinities), there is that of the body. Therefore it is certain that m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81\nperishes thus entirely.\n\n"If it is said that all the universe is, that Brahman alone is that is of the\nnature of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad. If it is said that the universe shines, thon it is Brahman\nalone that shines. (The mirage of) all the water in an oasis is really no\nother than the oasis itself. Through. inquiry of one\'s Self, the three worlds\n(above, below and middle) are only of the nature of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad. In Brahman, which is\none and alone, the essence of whose nature is absolute Consciousness and which\nis remote from the differences of j\xc4\xabva, \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara and guru, there is no aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na.\nSuch being the case, where then is the occasion for the universe there? I am\nthat Brahman which is all full. While the full moon of wisdom is robbed of its\nlustre by the r\xc4\x81hu (one of the two nodes of the moon) of delusion, all actions\n1 such as the rites of bathing, alms-giving and sacrifice performed during the\ntime of eclipse are all fruitless. As salt dissolved in water becomes one, so\nif \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and manas become identified, it is termed sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. Without the grace\nof a good (perfect) guru, the abandonment of sensual objects is very difficult\nof attainment; so also the perception of (divine) truth and the attainment of\none\'s true state. Then the state of being in one\'s own self shines of its own\naccord in a yogin in whom j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na-\xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi 2 has dawned and who has abandoned all\nkarmas. The (property of) fluctuation is natural to mercury and mind. If\neither mercury is bound (or consolidated) or mind is bound (or controlled),\nwhat then on this earth cannot be accomplished? He who obtains m\xc5\xabrchchh\xc4\x81 3\ncures all. diseases. The dead are brought to life again. He who has bound (his\nmind or mercury) is able to move in the air. Therefore mercury and mind confer\nupon one the state of Brahman. The master of in\xe1\xb8\x8driyas (the organs) is manas\n(mind). The master of manas is pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. The master of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a is laya (absorption\nyoga). Therefore laya-yoga should be practised. To the yogins, laya (-yoga) is\nsaid to be\n\np. 229\n\nwithout actions and changes. This laya (absorption) of mind which is above\nspeech and in which one has to abandon all sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpas and to give up completely\nall actions, should be known through one\'s own (experience). As an actress,\nthough subject (or dancing in harmony) to music, cymbals and other musical\ninstruments of time, has her mind intent upon the protection of the pot on her\nhead, so the yogin, though intent for the time being upon the hosts of\nobjects, never leaves off the mind contemplating on Brahman. The person who\ndesires all the wealth of yoga should, after having given up all thoughts,\npractise with a subdued mind concentration on n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da (spiritual sound) alone."\n\n##### Chapter III\n\n"The One Principle cannot at any time become of manifold forms. As I am the\npartless, there is none else but myself. Whatever is seen and whatever is\nheard is no other than Brahman. I am that Parabrahman, which is the eternal,\nthe immaculate, the free, the one, the undivided bliss, the non-dual, the\ntruth, the wisdom, and the endless. I am of the nature of bliss; I am of\nundivided wisdom; I am the supreme of the supreme; I am the resplendent\nabsolute Consciousness. As the clouds do not touch the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, so the miseries\nattendant on mundane existence do not affect me. Know all to be happiness\nthrough the annihilation of sorrow and all to be of the nature of sa\xe1\xb9\xad (be-\nness) through the annihilation of asa\xe1\xb9\xad (not-be-ness). It is only the nature of\nChi\xe1\xb9\xad (Consciousness) that is associated with this visible universe. Therefore\nmy form is partless. To an exalted yogin, there is neither birth nor death,\nnor going (to other spheres), nor returning (to earth); there is no stain or\npurity or knowledge but (the universe) shines to him as absolute\nConsciousness. Practise always silence \'I am ( _viz_., that you yourself are)\nParabrahman\' which is truth and absolute Consciousness, which is undivided and\nnon-dual, which is invisible, which is stainless, which is pure, which is\nsecond-less, and which is beneficent. It (Brahman) is not subject to\n\np. 230\n\nbirth and death, happiness and misery. It is not subject to caste, law, family\nand go\xe1\xb9\xadra (clan). Practise silence--I am Chi\xe1\xb9\xad which is the vivar\xe1\xb9\xada-up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na 1 (\n_viz_., the illusory cause) of the universe. Always practise silence--I am (\n_viz_., you are) the Brahman, that is the full, the secondless, the undivided\nconsciousness which has neither the relationship nor the differences existing\nin the universe and which partakes of the essence of the non-dual and the\nsupreme Sa\xe1\xb9\xad and Chi\xe1\xb9\xad.\n\n"That which always is and that which preserves the same nature during the\nthree periods of time, unaffected by anything, is my eternal form of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad. Even\nthe state of happiness which is eternal without up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhis (vehicles) and which\nis superior to all the happiness derivable from sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi is of my bliss only.\nAs by the rays of the sun, thick gloom is soon destroyed, so darkness, the\ncause of rebirth is destroyed by Hari (Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u) _viz_., the sun\'s lustre.\nThrough the contemplation and worship of my (Hari\'s) feet, every person is\ndelivered from his ignorance. The means of destroying deaths and births is\nonly through the contemplation of my feet. As a lover of wealth praises a\nwealthy man, so if with earnestness a person praises the Cause of the\nuniverse, who will not be delivered from bondage?\n\n"As in presence of the sun the world of its own accord begins to perform its\nactions, so in my presence all the worlds are animated to action. As to the\nmother-of-pearl, the illusory conception of silver is falsely attributed, so\nto me is falsely attributed through m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 this universe which is composed of\nmaha\xe1\xb9\xad, etc. I am not with those differences that are (observable) in the body\nof low caste men, the body of cow, etc., the fixed ones, the bodies of\nbr\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as and others. As to a person, even after being relieved from the\nmisconception of the directions, the (same misconception of) direction\ncontinues (as before),\n\np. 231\n\njust so is to me the universe though destroyed by vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. Therefore the\nuniverse is not. I am neither the body nor the organs of sense and action, nor\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, nor manas, nor bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, nor aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra, nor chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, nor m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81, nor the\nuniverse including \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b and others. Neither am I the actor, the enjoyer, nor\nhe who causes the enjoyment. I am Brahman that is Chi\xe1\xb9\xad, Sa\xe1\xb9\xad and \xc4\x80nan\xe1\xb8\x8da alone\nand that is Jan\xc4\x81rda\xe1\xb9\x87a (Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u).\n\n"As, through the fluctuation of water, the sun (reflected therein) is moved,\nso \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 arises in this mundane existence through its mere connection with\naha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra. This mundane existence has chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada as its root. This (chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada) should\nbe cleansed by -repeated effort. How is it you have your confidence in the\ngreatness of chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada? Alas, where is all the wealth of the kings! Where are the\nBrahm\xc4\x81s? Where are all the worlds? All old ones are gone. Many fresh\nevolutions have occurred. Many crores of Brahm\xc4\x81s have passed away. Many kings\nhave flitted away like particles of dust. Even to a j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab, the love of the\nbody may arise through the asura (demoniacal) nature. If the asura nature\nshould arise in a wise man, his knowledge of truth becomes fruitless. Should\nrajas and others generated in us be burnt by the fire of discriminative\n(divine) wisdom, how can they germinate again? Just as a very intelligent\nperson delights in the shortcomings of another, so if one finds out his own\nfaults (and corrects them) who will not be relieved from bondage? O Lord of\nmunis, only he who has not \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and who is not an emancipated person,\nlongs after si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis. He attains such si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis through medicine, 1 (or wealth),\nman\xe1\xb9\xadras, religious works, time and skill. In the eyes of an \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab, these\nsi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis are of no importance. One who has become an \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab, one who has his\nsight solely on \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, and one who is content with \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (the higher self)\nthrough (his) \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (or the lower self), never follows (the dictates of)\navi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81. Whatever exists in this world, he knows to be of the nature of avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81.\nHow then will an \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab who has relinquished avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 be immersed in (or\naffected by) it. Though medicine, man\xe1\xb9\xadras, religious work, time and skill (or\nmystical\n\np. 232\n\nexpressions) lead to the development of si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis, yet they cannot in any way\nhelp one to attain the seat of Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. How then can one who is an \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab\nand who is without his mind be said to long after si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis, while all the\nactions of his desires are controlled?"\n\n##### Chapter IV\n\nOn another occasion Ni\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81gha asked Lord \xe1\xb9\x9abhu to enlighten him as to the\ncharacteristics of j\xc4\xabvanmukti. 1 To which \xe1\xb9\x9abhu replied in the affirmative and\nsaid the following:\n\n"In the seven bh\xc5\xabmik\xc4\x81s or (stages of development of wisdom) there are four\nkinds of j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xadas. 1 Of these the first stage 2 is \xc5\x9bubhechchh\xc4\x81 (good\ndesire); the second is vich\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 (inquiry); the third is tanum\xc4\x81nas\xc4\xab (or\npertaining to the thinned mind); the fourth is sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadv\xc4\x81pa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi (the attainment of\nsa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva); the fifth is asamsak\xe1\xb9\xadi (non-attachment); the sixth is the\npa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81r\xe1\xb9\xadhabh\xc4\x81van\xc4\x81 (analysis of objects) and the seventh is the \xe1\xb9\xadurya (fourth or\nfinal stage). The bh\xc5\xabmik\xc4\x81 which is of the form of pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om) is formed of\n(or is divided into) ak\xc4\x81ra--A, uk\xc4\x81ra--U, mak\xc4\x81ra--M, and ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81. Ak\xc4\x81ra and\nothers are of four kinds on account of the difference of s\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc5\xabla (gross),\ns\xc5\xabkshma (subtle), b\xc4\xabja (seed or causal), and s\xc4\x81ksh\xc4\xab (witness). Their avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81s\nare four: waking, dreaming, dreamless sleeping and \xe1\xb9\xadurya (fourth). He who is\nin (or the entity that identifies itself with) the waking state in the gross\nam\xc5\x9ba (essence or part) of ak\xc4\x81ra is named Vi\xc5\x9bva; in the subtle essence, he is\ntermed \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa; in the b\xc4\xabja essence, he is termed Pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a; and in the s\xc4\x81ksh\xc4\xab\nessence, he is termed \xe1\xb9\xacurya.\n\n"He who is in the dreaming state (or the entity which identifies itself with\nthe dreaming state) in the gross essence of uk\xc4\x81ra is Vi\xc5\x9bva; in the subtle\nessence, he is termed \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa; in the b\xc4\xabja essence, is termed Pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a; and in\nthe s\xc4\x81ksh\xc4\xab essence, he is termed \xe1\xb9\xacurya.\n\n"He who is in the sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi state in the gross essence of mak\xc4\x81ra is termed\nVi\xc5\x9bva; in the subtle essence, \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa; in the\n\np. 233\n\nb\xc4\xabja essence, he is termed Pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a; and in the s\xc4\x81ksh\xc4\xab essence, he is termed\n\xe1\xb9\xacurya.\n\n"He who is in \xe1\xb9\xadurya state in the gross essence of ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 is termed \xe1\xb9\xacurya-\nvi\xc5\x9bva.

The\n\xe1\xb9\xadurya essence of ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 is the sixth stage. Beyond this, is the seventh\nstage.\n\n"One who functions in the (first) three bh\xc5\xabmik\xc4\x81s is called mumukshu; one who\nfunctions in the fourth bh\xc5\xabmik\xc4\x81 is called a brahmavi\xe1\xb9\xad; one who functions in\nthe fifth bh\xc5\xabmik\xc4\x81 is called a brahmavi\xe1\xb8\x8dvara; one who functions in the sixth\nbh\xc5\xabmik\xc4\x81 is called a brahmavi\xe1\xb8\x8dvar\xc4\xabya; and one in the seventh bh\xc5\xabmik\xc4\x81 is called\na brahmavi\xe1\xb8\x8dvarishtha. With reference to this, there are \xc5\x9blokas. They are:\n\n"\'\xc5\x9aubhechchh\xc4\x81 is said to be the first j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81nabh\xc5\xabmi (or stage of wisdom);\nvich\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81, the second; tanum\xc4\x81nas\xc4\xab, the third; sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadv\xc4\x81pa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi, the fourth; then\ncome asamsak\xe1\xb9\xadi as the fifth, pa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81r\xe1\xb9\xadhabh\xc4\x81van\xc4\x81 as the sixth and \xe1\xb9\xadurya as the\nseventh.\'\n\n"The desire that arises in one through sheer vair\xc4\x81gya (after resolving) \'Shall\nI be ignorant? I will be seen by the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras and the wise (or I will study the\nbooks and be with the wise)\' is termed by the wise as \xc5\x9aubhechchh\xc4\x81. The\nassociation with the wise and \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras and the following of the right path\npreceding the practice of indifference is termed vich\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81. That stage wherein\nthe hankering after sensual objects is thinned through the first and second\nstages is said to be tanum\xc4\x81nas\xc4\xab. That stage wherein having become indifferent\nto all sensual objects through the exercise in the (above) three stages, the\npurified chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada rests on \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 which is of the nature of sa\xe1\xb9\xad is called\nsa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadv\xc4\x81pa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi. The light (or manifestation) of sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvagu\xe1\xb9\x87a that is firmly rooted\n(in one) without any desire for the fruits of actions through the practice in\nthe above four stages\n\np. 234\n\nis termed asamsak\xe1\xb9\xadi. That stage wherein through the practice in the (above)\nfive stages one, having found delight in \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma, has no conception of the\ninternals or externals (though before him) and engages in actions only when\nimpelled to do so by others is termed pa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81r\xe1\xb9\xadhabh\xc4\x81van\xc4\x81, the sixth stage. The\nstage wherein after exceedingly long practice in the (above) six stages one is\n(immovably) fixed in the contemplation of \'\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma alone without the difference\n(of the universe) is the seventh stage called \xe1\xb9\xadurya. The three stages\nbeginning with \xc5\x9aubhechch\xc4\x81 are said to be attained with (or amidst) differences\nand non-differences. (Because) the universe one sees in the waking state he\nthinks to be really existent. When the mind is firmly fixed on the non-dual\nOne and the conception of duality is put down, then he sees this universe as a\ndream through his union with the fourth stage. As the autumnal cloud being\ndispersed vanishes, so this universe perishes. O Ni\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81gha, be convinced that\nsuch a person has only sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva remaining. Then having ascended the fifth stage\ncalled sushup\xe1\xb9\xadipa\xe1\xb8\x8da (dreamless sleeping seat), he remains simply in the non-\ndual state, being freed from all the various differences. Having always\nintrovision though ever participating in external actions, those that are\nengaged in the practice of this (sixth stage) are seen like one sleeping when\nfatigued ( _viz_., being freed from all affinities). (Lastly) the seventh\nstage which is the ancient and which is called g\xc5\xabdhasup\xe1\xb9\xadi 1 is generally\nattained. Then one remains in that secondless state without fear and with his\nconsciousness almost annihilated where there is neither sa\xe1\xb9\xad nor asa\xe1\xb9\xad, neither\nself nor not-self. Like an empty pot in the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, there is void both within\nand without; like a filled vessel in the midst of an ocean, he is full both\nwithin and without. Do not become either the knower or the known. May you\nbecome the Reality which remains after all thoughts are given up. Having\ndiscarded (all the distinctions of) the seer, the sight and the seen with\ntheir affinities, meditate solely upon \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 which shines as the supreme Light.\n\n"He is said to be a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada (emancipated person) in whom, though\nparticipating in the material concerns of the\n\np. 235\n\nworld, the universe is not seen to exist like the invisible \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. He is said\nto be a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada, the light of whose mind never sets or rises in misery or\nhappiness, and who does not seek to change what happens to him ( _viz_.,\neither to diminish his misery or increase his happiness). He is said to be a\nj\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada who though in his sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi is awake and to whom the waking state is\nunknown and whose wisdom is free from the affinities (of objects).\n\n"He is said to be a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada whose heart is pure like \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, though acting\n(as if) in consonance to love, hatred, fear and others.

He is\nsaid to be a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada, of whom people are not afraid, who is not afraid of\npeople and who has given up joy, anger and fear. He is said to be a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada\nwho, though participating in all the illusory objects, is cool amidst them and\nis a full Mind, (being) as if they belonged to others. O muni, he is called a\nj\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada who, having eradicated all the desires of his chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, is (fully)\ncontent with me who am the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 of all. He is said to be a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada who\nrests with an unshaken mind in that all pure abode which is Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 and free\nfrom all the modifications of chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada.

There is none other than \xc5\x9aiva. The\nundaunted Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a having known Him (\xc5\x9aiva) should attain wisdom. One need not\nutter many words as they but injure the organ of speech.\n\n"(The \xe1\xb9\x9ashi) \xc5\x9auka 1 is a muk\xe1\xb9\xada (emancipated person). (The \xe1\xb9\x9ashi) V\xc4\x81ma\xe1\xb8\x8deva is a\nmuk\xe1\xb9\xada. There are no others (who have attained emancipation) than through these\n( _viz_., the two\n\np. 236\n\npaths of these two \xe1\xb9\x9ashis). \'Those brave men who follow the path of \xc5\x9auka in\nthis world become sa\xe1\xb8\x8dyomuk\xe1\xb9\xadas ( _viz_., emancipated) immediately after (the\nbody [wears](errata.htm#16) away); while those who always follow the path of\nve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada in this world are subject again and again to rebirths and attain krama\n(gradual) emancipation, through yoga, s\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85khya and karmas associated with\nsa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva (gu\xe1\xb9\x87a). Thus there are two paths laid down by the Lord of \xe1\xb8\x8cevas (\n_viz_.,) the \xc5\x9auka and V\xc4\x81ma\xe1\xb8\x8deva paths. The \xc5\x9auka path is called the bird\'s path:\nwhile the V\xc4\x81ma\xe1\xb8\x8dev\xc4\x81 path is called the ant\'s path. 1 Those persons that have\ncognised the true nature of their \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 through the mandatory and prohibitory\ninjunctions (of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das), the inquiry into (the true meaning of) mah\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81kyas\n(the sacred sentences of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das), the sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi of s\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85khya yoga or\nasampraj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xada sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi 2 and that have thereby purified themselves, attain the\nsupreme seat through the \xc5\x9auka path. Having, through hathayoga 3 practice with\nthe pain caused by yama, postures, etc., become liable to the ever recurring\nobstacles caused by a\xe1\xb9\x87im\xc4\x81 and other (si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis) and having not obtained good\nresults, one is born again in a great family and practises yoga through his\nprevious (karmic) affinities. Then through the practice of yoga during many\nlives, he attains salvation ( _viz_.,) the supreme seat of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u through the\nV\xc4\x81ma\xe1\xb8\x8deva path. Thus there are two paths that lead to the attainment of Brahman\nand that are beneficent. The one confers instantaneous salvation and the other\nconfers gradual salvation.\n\n"To one that sees (all) as the one (Brahman), where is delusion? Where is\nsorrow? Those that are under the eyes of those whose bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is solely occupied\nwith the truth (of Brahman) that is the end of all experience are released\nfrom all heinous sins. All beings inhabiting heaven and earth that fall under\nthe vision of Brahmavi\xe1\xb9\xads are at once emancipated from the sins committed\nduring many crores of births."\n\np. 237\n\n##### Chapter V\n\nThen Ni\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81gha asked Lord \xe1\xb9\x9abhu to enlighten him as to the rules (to be observed)\nin the practice of Yoga. Accordingly He (the Lord) said thus:\n\n"The body is composed of the five elements. It is filled with five ma\xe1\xb9\x87dalas\n(spheres). 1 That which is hard is P\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab (earth), one of them; that which is\nliquid is Apas; that which is bright is \xe1\xb9\xacejas (fire); motion is the property\nof V\xc4\x81yu; that which pervades everywhere is \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. All these should be known by\nan aspirant after Yoga. Through the blowing of V\xc4\x81yuma\xe1\xb9\x87dala in this body,\n(there are caused) 21,600 breaths every day and night. If there is a\ndiminution in the P\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xabma\xe1\xb9\x87dala, there arise folds in the body; if there is\ndiminution in the essence of Apas, there arises gradually greyness of hair; if\nthere is diminution in the essence of \xe1\xb9\xacejas, there is loss of hunger and\nlustre; if there is diminution in the essence of V\xc4\x81yu, there is incessant\ntremor; if there is diminution in the essence of \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, one dies. The j\xc4\xabvi\xe1\xb9\xada (\n_viz_., Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a) which possesses these elements having no place to rest (in the\nbody) owing to the diminution of the elements, rises up like birds flying up\nin the air. It is for this reason that it is called U\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81na (lit., flying up).\nWith reference to this, there is said to be a ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha (binding, also meaning a\nposture called Uddiy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87aban\xe1\xb8\x8dha, by which this flight can be arrested). This\nUddiy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87aban\xe1\xb8\x8dha 2 is to (or does away with) death, as a lion to an elephant.\nIts experience is in the body, as also the ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha. Its binding (in the body)\nis hurtful. If there is agitation of Agni (fire) within the belly, then there\nwill be caused much of pain. Therefore this (Uddiy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87aban\xe1\xb8\x8dha) should not be\npractised by one who is hungry or who has urgency to make water or void\nexcrement. He should take\n\np. 238\n\nmany times in small quantities proper and moderate food. He should practise\nMan\xe1\xb9\xadrayoga, 1 Layayoga and Hathayoga, through mild, middling and\ntranscendental methods (or periods) respectively. Laya, Man\xe1\xb9\xadra, and Hathayogas\nhave each (the same) eight subservients. They are yama, niyama, \xc4\x81sana,\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma, pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra, (Parana, \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na, and sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. 2 (Of these), yama is of\nten kinds. They are non-injury, truth, non-coveting, continence, compassion,\nstraightforwardness, patience, courage, moderate eating, and purity (bodily\nand mental). Niyama is of ten kinds. They are \xe1\xb9\xadapas (religious austerities),\ncontentment, belief in the existence of God or Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, charity, worship of\n\xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara (or God), listening to the exposition of religious doctrines, modesty,\na (good) intellect, japa (muttering of prayers), and vra\xe1\xb9\xada (religious\nobservances). There are eleven postures beginning with chakra. Chakra, pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma,\nkarma, may\xc5\xabra, kukkuta, v\xc4\xabra, svas\xe1\xb9\xadika, bha\xe1\xb8\x8dra, simha, muk\xe1\xb9\xada, and gomukha, are\nthe postures enumerated by the knowers of yoga. Placing the left ankle on the\nright thigh and the right ankle on the left thigh, and keeping the body erect\n(while sitting) is the posture "Chakra". Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma should be practised again\nand again in the following order, _viz_., inspiration, restraint of breath and\nexpiration. The pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma is done through the n\xc4\x81dis (nerves). Hence it is\ncalled the n\xc4\x81dis themselves.\n\n"The body of every sentient being is ninety-six digits long. In the middle of\nthe body, two digits above the anus and two digits below the sexual organ, is\nthe centre of the body (called M\xc5\xabl\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra or sacral plexus). Nine digits above\nthe genitals, there is kan\xe1\xb8\x8da of n\xc4\x81dis which revolves oval-shaped, four digits\nhigh and four digits broad. It is surrounded by fat, flesh, bone, and blood.\nIn it, is situate a n\xc4\x81d\xc4\xab-chakra (wheel of nerves) having twelve spokes.\nKu\xe1\xb9\x87dal\xc4\xab by which this body is supported is there. It is covering by its face\nthe Brahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra ( _viz_., Brahma\'s hole) of Sushumn\xc4\x81. (By the side) of\nSushumn\xc4\x81 dwell the n\xc4\x81dis\n\np. 239\n\n[paragraph continues] Alambus\xc4\x81 and Kuh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\xa5. In the next two (spokes) are V\xc4\x81ru\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81\nand Ya\xc5\x9basvin\xc4\xab. On the spoke south of Sushumn\xc4\x81 is, in regular course, Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81.\nOn the next two spokes, are Pasha and Payasvin\xc4\xab. On the spoke west of Sushumn\xc4\x81\nis the n\xc4\x81di called Sarasva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab. On the next two spokes are \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85khin\xc4\xab and\nG\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81r\xc4\xab. To the north of Sushumn\xc4\x81 dwells Id\xc4\x81; in the next is Has\xe1\xb9\xadijihv\xc4\x81; in\nthe next is Vi\xc5\x9bvodar\xc4\x81. In these spokes of the wheel, the twelve n\xc4\x81dis carry\nthe twelve v\xc4\x81yus from left to right (to the different parts of the body). The\nn\xc4\x81dis are like ( _i.e._ , woven like the warp and woof of) cloth. They are\nsaid to have different colours. The central portion of the cloth (here the\ncollection of the n\xc4\x81dis) is called the N\xc4\x81bhichakra (navel plexus). Jvalan\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab,\nN\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dar\xc5\xabpi\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab, Pararan\xe1\xb8\x8dhr\xc4\x81, and Sushumn\xc4\x81 are called the (basic) supports of n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da\n(spiritual sound). These four n\xc4\x81dis are of ruby colour. The central portion of\nBrahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra is again and again covered by Ku\xe1\xb9\x87dal\xc4\xab. Thus ten v\xc4\x81yus move in\nthese n\xc4\x81dis. A wise man who has understood the course of n\xc4\x81dis and v\xc4\x81yus\nshould, after keeping his neck and body erect with his mouth closed,\ncontemplate immovably upon \xe1\xb9\xacuryaka (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) at the tip of his nose, in the\ncentre of his heart and in the middle of bin\xe1\xb8\x8du, 1 and should see, with a\ntranquil mind through the (mental) eyes, the nectar flowing from there. Having\nclosed the anus and drawn up the v\xc4\x81yu and caused it to rise through (the\nrepetition of) pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om), he should complete with \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab b\xc4\xabja. He should\ncontemplate upon his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab (or Par\xc4\x81\xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi) and as being bathed by nectar.\nThis is k\xc4\x81lava\xc3\xb1chana (lit., time illusion). It is said to be the most\nimportant of all. Whatever is thought of by the mind is accomplished by the\nmind itself. (Then) agni (fire) will flame in jala (water) and in the flame\n(of agni) will arise the branches and blossoms. Then the words uttered and the\nactions done regarding the universe, are not in vain. By checking the bin\xe1\xb8\x8du in\nthe path, by making the fire flame up in the water and by causing the water to\ndry up, the body is made firm. Having contracted simultaneously the anus and\nyoni (the womb) united together, he should draw up Ap\xc4\x81na and unite with it\nSam\xc4\x81na. He\n\np. 240\n\nshould contemplate upon his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as \xc5\x9aiva and then as being bathed by nectar.\nIn the central part of each spoke, the yogin should commence to concentrate\nBala (will or strength). He should try to go up by the union of Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and\nAp\xc4\x81na. This most important yoga brightens up in the body the path of si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis.\nAs a dam across the water serves as an obstacle to the floods, so it should\never be known by the yogins that the chh\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 of the body is (to j\xc4\xabva). This\nban\xe1\xb8\x8dha is said of all n\xc4\x81dis. Through the grace of this ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha, the \xe1\xb8\x8ceva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\n(goddess) becomes visible. This ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha of four feet serves as a check to the\nthree paths. This brightens up the path through which the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhas obtained\n(their si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis). If with Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a is made to rise up soon U\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na, this ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha\nchecking all n\xc4\x81dis goes up. This is called Samputayoga or M\xc5\xablaban\xe1\xb8\x8dha. Through\nthe practising of this yoga, the three ban\xe1\xb8\x8dhas are mastered. By practising day\nand night intermittingly or at any convenient time, the v\xc4\x81yu will come under\nhis control. With the control of v\xc4\x81yu, agni (the gastric fire) in the body\nwill increase daily. With the increase of agni, food, etc., will be easily\ndigested. Should food be properly digested, there is increase of rasa (essence\nof food). With the daily increase of rasa, there is the increase of \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadus\n(spiritual substances). With the increase of \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadus, there is the increase of\nwisdom in the body. Thus all the sins collected together during many crores of\nbirths are burnt up.\n\n"In the centre of the anus and the genitals, there is the triangular\nM\xc5\xabl\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra. It illumines the seat of \xc5\x9aiva of the form of bin\xe1\xb8\x8du. There is\nlocated the Par\xc4\x81\xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi named ku\xe1\xb9\x87dalin\xc4\xab. From that seat, v\xc4\x81yu arises. From that\nseat, agni becomes increased. From that seat, bin\xe1\xb8\x8du originates and n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da\nbecomes increased. From that seat, Hamsa is born. From that seat, manas is\nborn. The six chakras beginning with M\xc5\xabl\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra are said to be the seat of\n\xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi (Goddess). From the neck to the top of the head is said to the seat of\n\xc5\x9aambhu (\xc5\x9aiva). To the n\xc4\x81dis, the body is the support (or vehicle); to Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a,\nthe n\xc4\x81dis are the support; to j\xc4\xabva, Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a is the dwelling place; to Hamsa,\nj\xc4\xabva is the support; to \xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi, Hamsa is the seat and the locomotive and fixed\nuniverse.\n\np. 241\n\n"Being without distraction and of a calm mind, one should practise pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma.\nEven a person who is well-skilled in the practice of the three ban\xe1\xb8\x8dhas should\ntry always to cognise with a true heart that Principle which should be known\nand is the cause of all objects and their attributes. Both expiration and\ninspiration should (be stopped and made to) rest in restraint of breath\n(alone). He should depend solely on Brahman which is the highest aim of all\nvisibles. (The giving out of) all external objects is said to be rechaka\n(expiration). The (taking in of the) spiritual knowledge of the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras is\nsaid to be p\xc5\xabraka (inspiration) and (the keeping to oneself of) such knowledge\nis said to be kumbhaka (or restraint of breath). He is an emancipated person\nwho practises thus such a chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada. There is no doubt about it. Through\nkumbhaka, it (the mind) should be always taken up, and through kumbhaka alone\nit should be filled up within. It is only through kumbhaka that kumbhaka\nshould be firmly mastered. Within it is Parama\xc5\x9biva. That (v\xc4\x81yu) which is non-\nmotionless should be shaken again through ka\xe1\xb9\x87tha-mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81 (throat-posture).\nHaving checked the course of v\xc4\x81yu, having become perfect in the practice of\nexpiration and restraint of breath and having planted evenly on the ground the\ntwo hands and the two feet, one should pierce the four seats through v\xc4\x81yu\nthrough the three yogas. He should shake Mah\xc4\x81meru with the (aid of) prakotis\n(forces) 1 at the mouth of v\xc4\x81yu. The two putas (cavities) being drawn, v\xc4\x81yu\nthrobs quickly. The union of moon, sun and agni should be known on account of\nnectar. Through the motion of Meru, the \xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81s who stay in the centre of Meru\nmove. At first in his Brahma-gran\xe1\xb9\xadhi, there is produced soon a hole (or\npassage). Then having pierced Brahma-gran\xe1\xb9\xadhi, he pierces Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u-gran\xe1\xb9\xadhi then\nhe pierces Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra-gran\xe1\xb9\xadhi. Then to the yogin comes ve\xe1\xb8\x8dha 2 (piercing) through\nhis liberation from the impurities of delusion, through the religious\nceremonies (performed) in various births, through the grace of gurus and\n\xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81s and through the practice of yoga.\n\np. 242\n\n"In the ma\xe1\xb9\x87dala (sphere or region) of Sushumn\xc4\x81 (situated between Id\xc4\x81 and\nPi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81, v\xc4\x81yu should be made to rise up through the feature known as Mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81-\nban\xe1\xb8\x8dha. The short pronunciation (of Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava) frees (one) from sins: its long\npronunciation confers (on one) moksha. So also its pronunciation in \xc4\x81py\xc4\x81yana\nor plu\xe1\xb9\xada svara (tone). He is a knower of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8da, who through the above-mentioned\nthree ways of pronunciation 1 knows the end of Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava which is beyond the\npower of speech, like the never-ceasing flow of oil or the long-drawn bell-\nsound. The short svara goes to bin\xe1\xb8\x8du. The long svara goes to brahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra:\nthe plu\xe1\xb9\xada to \xe1\xb8\x8dv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da\xc5\x9b\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada (twelfth centre). The man\xe1\xb9\xadras should be uttered on\naccount of getting man\xe1\xb9\xadra si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis. This Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (OM) will remove all\nobstacles. It will remove all sins. Of this, are four bh\xc5\xabmik\xc4\x81s (states)\npredicated, _viz_., \xc4\x81rambha, ghata, parichaya, and nishpa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi. \xc4\x80rambha is that\nstate in which one having abandoned external karmas performed by the three\norgans (mind, speech and body), is always engaged in mental karma only. It is\nsaid by the wise that the ghata state is that in which v\xc4\x81yu having forced an\nopening on the western side and being full, is firmly fixed there. Parichaya\nstate is that in which vayu is firmly fixed to \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, neither associated with\nj\xc4\xabva nor not, while the body is immovable. It is said that nishpa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi state is\nthat in which there take place creation and dissolution through \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 or that\nstate in which a yogin having become a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada performs yoga without\neffort.\n\n"Whoever recites this Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d becomes immaculate like agni. Like v\xc4\x81yu, he\nbecomes pure. He becomes freed from the sin of drinking alcohol. He becomes\nfreed from the sins of the theft of gold. He becomes a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada. This is\nwhat is said by the \xe1\xb9\x9agve\xe1\xb8\x8da. Like the eye pervading the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b (seeing without\neffort everything above), a wise man sees (always) the supreme seat of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u.\nThe br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as who have always their spiritual eyes wide open praise and\nilluminate in diverse ways the spiritual seat of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\n"Om, thus is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[220:1](tmu29.htm#fr_189) This means boar and refers to the incarnation of\nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u as a boar.\n\n[220:2](tmu29.htm#fr_190) Books such as _Mah \xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\xada_ and _R \xc4\x81m\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a_.\n\n[220:3](tmu29.htm#fr_191) Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, Ap\xc4\x81na, U\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na, Vy\xc4\x81na and Sam\xc4\x81na, having their\nrespective places and functions in the body.\n\n[220:4](tmu29.htm#fr_192) Sound, touch, form, taste and odour.\n\n[220:5](tmu29.htm#fr_193) Producing respectively uncertainty, certain\nknowledge, fluctuation of thought, and egoism and having certain centres in\nthe body.\n\n[221:1](tmu29.htm#fr_194) In the states of waking, dreaming and dreamless\nsleeping.\n\n[221:2](tmu29.htm#fr_195) Being past karmas now being enjoyed, past karmas\nbeing in store to be enjoyed hereafter and the karmas now produced to be\nenjoyed hereafter.\n\n[221:3](tmu29.htm#fr_196) Presiding over water or tongue.\n\n[221:4](tmu29.htm#fr_197) Presiding over odour or nose.\n\n[221:5](tmu29.htm#fr_198) Presiding over leg or nether world.\n\n[221:6](tmu29.htm#fr_199) Vide the translation of Sarvas\xc4\x81ra-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n[221:7](tmu29.htm#fr_200) This refers to the several class of persons in\ndifferent modes of life who wear their hair in different ways as yogins,\nascetics and so on.\n\n[222:1](tmu29.htm#fr_201) Meaning respectively mental restraint, bodily\nrestraint, the renunciation or practising of works without reference to their\nfruits, endurance of heart and soul, etc., faith and settled peace of mind.\n\n[222:2](tmu29.htm#fr_202) Meaning meditation and reflection thereon.\n\n[225:1](tmu29.htm#fr_203) _Viz_., Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, the Lord of all persons.\n\n[228:1](tmu29.htm#fr_204) During the solar and lunar eclipses, these rites are\ndone by the Hin\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc5\xabs.\n\n[228:2](tmu29.htm#fr_205) Of the six sak\xe1\xb9\xadis, she is one that gives wisdom.\n\n[228:3](tmu29.htm#fr_206) Either controlling the breath through pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma or\nthe consolidation of mercury through some means, leading in both cases to\nsi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis, etc.\n\n[230:1](tmu29.htm#fr_207) Of the two causes of the universe, Spirit is the\nnimi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada (instrumental) cause while matter is the up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na (material) cause.\nThis material cause is again subdivided into three: _viz_., \xc4\x81rambha (initial),\npari\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81ma (changed) and vivar\xe1\xb9\xada (illusory).
