Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# MAHABHARATA - TRANSLATOR\'S EPILOGUE\n\nANCIENT India, like ancient Greece, boasts of two great Epics. One of them,\nthe _Maha-bharata_ , relates to a great war in which all the warlike races of\nNorthern India took a share, and may therefore be compared to the Iliad. The\nother, the _Ramayana_ , relates mainly to the adventures of its hero, banished\nfrom his country and wandering for long years in the wildernesses of Southern\nIndia, and may therefore be compared to the Odyssey. It is the first of these\ntwo Epics, the Iliad of Ancient India, which is the subject of the foregoing\npages.\n\nThe great war which is the subject of this Epic is believed to have been\nfought in the thirteenth or fourteenth century before Christ. For generations\nand centuries after the war its main incidents must have been sung by bards\nand minstrels in the courts of Northern India. The war thus became the centre\nof a cycle of legends, songs, and poems in ancient India, even as Charlemagne\nand Arthur became the centres of legends in mediaeval Europe. And then,\nprobably under the direction of some enlightened king, the vast mass of\nlegends and poetry, accumulated during centuries, was cast in a narrative form\nand formed the Epic of the Great Bharata nation, and therefore called the\n_Maha-bharata_. The real facts of the war had been obliterated by age,\nlegendary heroes had become the principal actors, and, as is invariably the\ncase in India, the thread of a high moral purpose, of the triumph of virtue\nand the subjugation of vice, was woven into the fabric of the great Epic.\n\nWe should have been thankful if this Epic, as it was thus originally put\ntogether some centuries before the Christian era, had been preserved to us.\nBut this was not to be. The Epic became so popular that it went on growing\nwith the growth of centuries. Every generation of poets had something to add;\nevery distant nation in Northern India was anxious to interpolate some account\nof its deeds in the old record of the international war; every preacher of a\nnew creed desired to have in the old Epic some sanction for the new truths he\ninculcated. Passages from legal and moral codes were incorporated in the work\nwhich appealed to the nation much more effectively than dry codes; and rules\nabout the different castes and about the different stages of the human life\nwere included for the same purpose. All the floating mass of tales,\ntraditions, legends, and myths, for which ancient India was famous, found a\nshelter under the expanding wings of this wonderful Epic; and as Krishna-\nworship became the prevailing religion of India after the decay of Buddhism,\nthe old Epic caught the complexion of the times, and Krishna-cult is its\ndominating religious idea in its present shape. It is thus that the work went\non growing for a thousand years after it was first compiled and put together\nin the form of an Epic; until the crystal rill of the Epic itself was all but\nlost in an unending morass of religious and didactic episodes, legends, tales,\nand traditions.\n\nWhen the mischief had been done, and the Epic had nearly assumed its present\nproportions, a few centuries after Christ according to the late Dr. Buhler, an\nattempt was made to prevent the further expansion of the work. The contents of\nthe Epic were described in some prefatory verses, and the number of couplets\nin each Book was stated. The total number of couplets, according to this\nmetrical preface, is about eighty-five thousand. But the limit so fixed has\nbeen exceeded in still later centuries; further additions and interpolations\nhave been made; and the Epic as printed and published in Calcutta in this\ncentury contains over ninety thousand couplets, excluding the Supplement about\nthe Race of Hari.\n\nThe modern reader will now understand the reason why this great Epic-the\ngreatest work of imagination that Asia has produced-has never yet been put\nbefore the European reader in a readable form. A poem of ninety thousand\ncouplets, about seven times the size of the Iliad and the Odyssey put\ntogether, is more than what the average reader can stand; and the\nheterogeneous nature of its contents does not add to the interest of the work.\nIf the religious works of Hooker and Jeremy Taylor, the philosophy of Hobbes\nand Locke, the commentaries of Blackstone and the ballads of Percy, together\nwith the tractarian writings of Newman, Keble, and Pusey, were all thrown into\nblank verse and incorporated with the Paradise Lost, the reader would scarcely\nbe much to blame if he failed to appreciate that delectable compound. A\ncomplete translation of the _Maha-bharata_ therefore into English verse is\nneither possible nor desirable, but portions of it have now and then been\nplaced before English readers by distinguished writers. Dean Milman\'s graceful\nrendering of the story of Nala and Damayanti is still read and appreciated by\na select circle of readers; and Sir Edwin Arnold\'s beautiful translation of\nthe concluding books of the Epic is familiar to a larger circle of Englishmen.\nA complete translation of the Epic into English prose has also been published\nin India, and is useful to Sanscrit scholars for the purpose of reference.\n\nBut although the old Epic had thus been spoilt by unlimited expansion, yet\nnevertheless the leading incidents and characters of the real Epic are still\ndiscernible, uninjured by the mass of foreign substance in which they are\nembedded--even like those immortal marble figures which have been recovered\nfrom the ruins of an ancient world, and now beautify the museums of modern\nEurope. For years past I have thought that it was perhaps not impossible to\nexhume this buried Epic from the superincumbent mass of episodical matter, and\nto restore it to the modern world. For years past I have felt a longing to\nundertake this work, but the task was by no means an easy one. Leaving out all\nepisodical matter, the leading narrative of the Epic forms about one-fourth of\nthe work; and a complete translation even of this leading story would be\nunreadable, both from its length and its prolixness. On the other hand, to\ncondense the story into shorter limits would be, not to make a translation,\nbut virtually to write a new poem; and that was not what I desired to\nundertake, nor what I was competent to perform.\n\nThere seemed to me only one way out of this difficulty. The main incidents of\nthe Epic are narrated in the original work in passages which are neither\ndiffuse nor unduly prolix, and which are interspersed in the leading narrative\nof the Epic, at that narrative itself is interspersed in the midst of more\nlengthy episodes. The more carefully I examined the arrangement, the more\nclearly it appeared to me that these main incidents of the Epic would bear a\nfull and unabridged translation into English verse; and that these\ntranslations, linked together by short connecting notes, would virtually\npresent the entire story of the Epic to the modern reader in a form and within\nlimits which might be acceptable. It would be, no doubt, a condensed version\nof the original Epic, but the condensation would be effected, not by the\ntranslator telling a short story in his own language, but by linking together\nthose passages of the original which describe the main and striking incidents,\nand thus telling the main story as told in the original work. The advantage of\nthis arrangement is that, in the passages presented to the reader, it is the\npoet who speaks to him, not the translator. Though vast portions of the\noriginal are skipped over, those which are presented are the portions which\nnarrate the main incidents of the Epic, and they describe those incidents as\ntold by the poet himself.\n\nThis is the plan I have generally adopted in the present work. Except in the\nthree books which describe the actual war (Books viii., ix., and x.), the\nother nine books of this translation are complete translations of selected\npassages of the original work. I have not attempted to condense these passages\nnor to expand them; I have endeavoured to put them before the English reader\nas they have been told by the poet in Sanscrit. Occasionally, but rarely, a\nfew redundant couplets have been left out, or a long list of proper names or\nobscure allusions has been shortened; and in one place only, at the beginning\nof the Fifth Book, I have added twelve couplets of my own to explain the\ncircumstances under which the story of Savitri is told. Generally, therefore,\nthe translation may be accepted as an unabridged, though necessarily a free\ntranslation of the passages describing the main incidents of the Epic.\n\nFrom this method I have been compelled to depart, much against my wish, in the\nthree books describing the actual war. No translation of an Epic relating to a\ngreat war can be acceptable which does not narrate the main events of the war.\nThe war of the, _Maha-bharata_ was a series of eighteen battles, fought on\neighteen consecutive days, and I felt it necessary to present the reader with\nan account of each day\'s work. In order to do so, I have been compelled to\ncondense, and not merely to translate selected passages. For the transactions\nof the war, unlike the other incidents of the Epic, have been narrated in the\noriginal with almost inconceivable prolixity and endless repetition; and the\nprocess of condensation in these three books has therefore been severe and\nthorough. But, nevertheless, even in these books I have endeavoured to\npreserve the character and the spirit of the original. Not only are the\nincidents narrated in the same order as in the original, but they are told in\nthe style of the poet as far as possible. Even the similes and metaphors and\nfigures of speech are all or mostly adopted from the original; the translator\nhas not ventured either to adopt his own distinct style of narration, or to\nimprove on the style of the original with his own decorations.\n\nSuch is the scheme I have adopted in presenting an Epic of ninety  \nthousand Sanscrit couplets in about two thousand English couplets.\n\nThe excellent and deservedly popular prose translation of the Odyssey of Homer\nby Messrs. Butcher and Lang often led me to think that perhaps a prose\ntranslation of these selected passages from the _Maha-bharata_ might be more\nacceptable to the modern reader. But a more serious consideration of the\nquestion dispelled that idea. Homer has an interest for the European reader\nwhich the _Maha-bharata_ cannot lay claim to; as the father of European poetry\nhe has a claim on the veneration of modern Europe which an Indian poet can\nnever pretend to. To thousands of European readers Homer is familiar in the\noriginal, to hundreds of thousands he is known in various translations in\nvarious modern languages. What Homer actually wrote, a numerous class of\nstudents in Europe wish to know; and a literal prose translation therefore is\nwelcome, after the great Epic has been so often translated in verse. The case\nis very different with the _Maha-bharata_ , practically unknown to European\nreaders. And the translators of Homer themselves gracefully acknowledge, "We\nhave tried to transfer, not all the truth about the poem, but the historical\ntruth into English. In this process Homer must lose at least half his charm,\nhis bright and equable speed, the musical current of that narrative, which,\nlike the river of Egypt, flows from an undiscoverable source, and mirrors the\ntemples and the palaces of unforgotten gods and kings. Without the music of\nverse, only a half truth about Homer can be told."\n\nAnother earnest worker of the present day, who is endeavouring to interpret to\nmodern Englishmen the thoughts and sentiments and poetry of their Anglo-Saxon\nancestors, has emphatically declared that "of all possible translations of\npoetry, a merely prose translation is the most inaccurate." "Prose," says Mr.\nStopford Brooke, further on, "no more represents poetry than architecture does\nmusic. Translations of poetry are never much good, but at least they should\nalways endeavour to have the musical movement of poetry, and to obey the laws\nof the verse they translate."\n\nThis appears to me to be a very sound maxim. And one of my greatest\ndifficulties in the task I have undertaken has been to try and preserve\nsomething of the "musical movement" of the sonorous Sanscrit poetry in the\nEnglish translation. Much of the Sanscrit Epic is written in the well-known\n_Sloka_ metre of sixteen syllables in each line, and I endeavoured to choose\nsome English metre which is familiar to the English ear, and which would\nreproduce to some extent the rhythm, the majesty, and the long and measured\nsweep of the Sanscrit verse. It was necessary to adopt such a metre in order\nto transfer something of the truth about the _Maha-bharata_. into English, for\nwithout such reproduction or imitation of the musical movement of the original\nvery much less than a half truth is told. My kind friend Mr. Edmund Russell,\nimpelled by that enthusiasm for Indian poetry and Indian art which is a part\nof him, rendered me valuable help and assistance in this matter, and I\ngratefully acknowledge, the benefit I have derived from his advice and\nsuggestions. After considerable trouble and anxiety, and after rendering\nseveral books in different English metres, I felt convinced that the one\nfinally adopted was a nearer approach to the Sanscrit Sloka than any other\nfamiliar English metre known to me.\n\nI have recited a verse in this English metre and a _Sloka_ in presence of\nlisteners who have a better ear for music than myself, and they have marked\nthe close resemblance. I quote a few lines from the Sanscrit showing varieties\nof the _Sloka_ metre, and comparing them with the scheme of the English metre\nselected.\n\n![](img/dutt00.jpg)\n\n![](img/dutt01.jpg)\n\nIt would be too much to assume that even with the help of this similarity in\nmetres, I have been able to transfer into my English that sweep and majesty of\nverse which is the charm of Sanscrit, and which often sustains and elevates\nthe simplest narration and the plainest ideas. Without the support of those\nsustaining wings, my poor narration must often plod through the dust; and I\ncan only ask for the indulgence of the reader, which every translator of\npoetry from a foreign language can with reason ask, if the story as told in\nthe translation is sometimes but a plain, simple, and homely narrative. For\nany artistic decoration I have neither the inclination nor the necessary\nqualification. The crisp and ornate style, the quaint expression, the\nchiselled word, the new-coined phrase, in which modern English poetry is rich,\nwould scarcely suit the translation of an old Epic whose predominating\ncharacteristic is its simple and easy flow of narrative. Indeed, the _Maha-\nbharata_ would lose that unadorned simplicity which is its first and foremost\nfeature if the translator ventured to decorate it with the art of the modern\nday, even if he had been qualified to do so.\n\nFor if there is one characteristic feature which distinguishes the _Maha-\nbharata_ (as well as the other Indian Epic, the _Ramayana_ ) from all later\nSanscrit literature, it is the grand simplicity of its narrative, which\ncontrasts with the artificial graces of later Sanscrit poptry. The poetry of\nKalidisa for instance, is ornate. and beautiful, and almost scintillates with\nsimiles in every verse; the poetry of the _Maha-bharara_ is plain and\nunpolished, and scarcely stoops to a simile or a figure of speech unless the\nsimile comes naturally to the poet. The great deeds of godlike kings sometimes\nsuggest to the poet the mighty deeds of gods; the rushing of warriors suggests\nthe rushing of angry elephants in the echoing jungle; the flight of whistling\narrows suggests the flight of sea-birds; the sound and movement of surging\ncrowds suggest the heaving of billows; the erect attitude of a warrior\nsuggests a tall cliff; the beauty of a maiden suggests the soft beauty of the\nblue lotus. When such comparisons come naturally to the poet, he accepts them\nand notes them down, but he never seems to go in quest of them, he is never\nanxious to beautify and decorate. He seems to trust entirely to his grand\nnarrative, to his heroic characters, to his stirring incidents, to hold\nmillions of listeners in perpetual thrall. The majestic and sonorous Sanscrit\nmetre is at his command, and even this he uses, carelessly, and with frequent\nslips, known as _arsha_ to later grammarians. The poet certainly seeks for no\nart to decorate his tale, he trusts to the lofty chronicle of bygone heroes to\nenchain the listening mankind.\n\nAnd what heroes! In the delineation of character the _Maha-bharata_ is far\nabove anything which we find in later Sanscrit poetry. Indeed, with much that\nis fresh and sweet and lovely in later Sanscrit poetry, there is little or no\nportraiture of character. All heroes are cast much in the same heroic mould;\nall love-sick heroines suffer in silence and burn with fever, all fools are\nshrewd and impudent by turns, all knaves are heartless and cruel and suffer in\nthe end. There is not much to distinguish between one warrior and another,\nbetween one tender woman and her sister. In the _Maha-bharata_ we find just\nthe reverse; each hero has a distinct individuality, a character of his own,\nclearly discernible from that of other heroes. No work of the imagination that\ncould be named, always excepting the Iliad, is so rich and so true as the\n_Maha-bharata_ in the portraiture of the human character,-not in torment and\nsuffering as in Dante, not under overwhelming passions as in Shakespeare,--but\nhuman character in its calm dignity of strength and repose, like those\nimmortal figures in marble which the ancients turned out, and which modern\nsculptors have vainly sought to reproduce. The old Kuru monarch Dhrita-\nrashtra, sightless and feeble, but majestic in his ancient grandeur; the noble\ngrandsire Bhishma, "death\'s subduer" and unconquerable in war; the doughty\nDrona, venerable priest and vengeful warrior; and the proud and peerless\narcher Karna-have each a distinct character of his own which can not be\nmistaken for a moment. The good and royal Yudhishthir, (I omit the final a in\nsome long names which occur frequently), the "tiger-waisted" Bhima, and the\n"helmet-wearing" Arjun are the Agamemnon, the Ajax, and the Achilles of the\nIndian Epic. The proud and unyielding Duryodhan, and the fierce and fiery\nDuhsasan stand out foremost among the wrathful sons of the feeble old Kuru\nmonarch. And Krishna possesses a character higher than that of Ulysses;\nunmatched in human wisdom, ever striving for righteousness and peace, he is\nthorough and unrelenting in war when war has begun. And the women of the\nIndian Epic possess characters as marked as those of the men. The stately and\nmajestic queen Gandhari, the loving and doting mother Pritha, the proud and\nscornful Draupadi nursing her wrath till her wrongs are fearfully revenged,\nand the bright and brilliant and sunny Subhadra,--these are distinct images\npencilled by the hand of a true master in the realm of creative imagination.\n\nAnd if the characters of the _Maha-bharata_ impress themselves on the reader,\nthe incidents of the Epic are no less striking. Every scene on the shifting\nstage is a perfect and impressive picture. The tournament of the princes in\nwhich Arjun and Karna-the Achilles and Hector of the Indian Epic-first met and\neach marked the other for his foe; the gorgeous bridal of Draupadi; the\nequally gorgeous coronation of Yudhishthir and the death of the proud and\nboisterous Sisupala; the fatal game of dice and the scornful wrath of Draupadi\nagainst her insulters; the calm beauty of the forest life of the Pandavs; the\ncattle-lifting in Matsyaland in which the gallant Arjun threw off his disguise\nand stood forth as warrior and conqueror; and the Homeric speeches of the\nwarriors in the council of war on the eve of the great contest,--each scene of\nthis venerable old Epic impresses itself on the mind of the hushed and\nastonished reader. Then follows the war of eighteen days. The first few days\nare more or less uneventful, and have been condensed in this translation often\ninto a few couplets; but the interest of the reader increases as he approaches\nthe final battle and fall of the grand old fighter Bhishma. Then follows the\nstirring story of the death of Arjun\'s gallant boy, and Arjun\'s fierce\nrevenge, and the death of the priest and warrior, doughty Drona. Last comes\nthe crowning event of the Epic, the final contest between Arjun and Karna, the\nheroes of the Epic, and the war ends in a midnight slaughter and the death of\nDuryodhan. The rest of the story is told in this translation in two books\ndescribing the funerals of the deceased warriors, and Yudhishthir\'s horse-\nsacrifice.\n\n"The poems of Homer," says Mr. Gladstone, "differ from all other known poetry\nin this, that they constitute in themselves an encyclopaedia of life and\nknowledge; at a time when knowledge, indeed, such as lies beyond the bounds of\nactual experience, was extremely limited, and when life was singularly fresh,\nvivid, and expansive." This remark applies with even greater force to the\n_Maha-bharata_ ; it is an encyclopaedia of the life and knowledge of Ancient\nIndia. And it discloses to us an ancient and forgotten world, a proud and\nnoble civilisation which has passed away. Northern India was then parcelled\namong warlike races living side by side under their warlike kings, speaking\nthe same language, performing the same religious rites and ceremonies,\nrejoicing in a common literature, rivalling each other in their schools of\nphilosophy and learning as in the arts of peace and civilisation, and forming\na confederation of Hindu nations unknown to and unknowing the outside world.\nWhat this confederation of nations has done for the cause of human knowledge\nand human civilisation is a matter of history. Their inquiries into the hidden\ntruths of religion, embalmed in the ancient _Upanishads_ , have never been\nexcelled within the last three thousand years. Their inquiries into\nphilosophy, preserved in the _Sankhya_ and the _Vedanta_ systems, were the\nfirst systems of true philosophy which the world produced. And their great\nworks of imagination, the _Maha-bharata_ and the _Ramayana_ , will be placed\nwithout hesitation by the side of Homer by critics who survey the world\'s\nliteratures from a lofty standpoint, and judge impartially of the wares turned\nout by the hand of man in all parts of the globe. It is scarcely necessary to\nadd that the discoveries of the ancient Hindus in science, and specially in\nmathematics, are the heritage of the modern world; and that the lofty religion\nof Buddha, proclaimed in India five centuries before Christ, is now the\nreligion of a third of the human race. For the rest, the people of modern\nIndia know how to appreciate their ancient heritage. It is not an exaggeration\nto state that the two hundred millions of Hindus of the present day cherish in\ntheir hearts the story of their ancient Epics. The Hindu scarcely lives, man\nor woman, high or low, educated or ignorant, whose earliest recollections do\nnot cling round the story and the characters of the great Epics. The almost\nilliterate oil-manufacturer or confectioner of Bengal spells out some modern\ntranslation of the Maha-bharata to while away his leisure hour. The tall and\nstalwart peasantry of the North-West know of the five Pandav brothers, and of\ntheir friend the righteous Krishna. The people of Bombay and Madras cherish\nwith equal ardour the story of the righteous war. And even the traditions and\ntales interspersed in the Epic, and which spoil the work as an Epic, have\nthemselves a charm and an attraction; and the morals inculcated in these tales\nsink into the hearts of a naturally religious people, and form the basis of\ntheir moral education. Mothers in India know no better theme for imparting\nwisdom and instruction to their daughters, and elderly men know no richer\nstorehouse for narrating tales to children, than these stories preserved in\nthe Epics. No work in Europe, not Homer in Greece or Virgil in Italy, not\nShakespeare or Milton in English-speaking lands, is the national property of\nthe nations to the same extent as the Epics of India are of the Hindus. No\nsingle work except the Bible has such influence in affording moral instruction\nin Christian lands as the _Maha-bharata_ and the _Ramayana_ in India. They\nhave been the cherished heritage of the Hindus for three thousand years; they\nare to the present day interwoven with the thoughts and beliefs and moral\nideas of a nation numbering two hundred millions.\n\nROMESH DUTT.\n\nUNIVERSITY COLLEGE, LONDON,  \n     13 _th_ _August_ 1898\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Glossary](duttglos.htm)\n\n'
