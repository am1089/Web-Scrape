VII.\n\nKrishn\xcc\x81a combats the serpent Kaliya: alarm of his parents and companions: he\novercomes the serpent, and is propitiated by him: commands him to depart from\nthe Yamuna river to the ocean.\n\nONE day Krishn\xcc\x81a, unaccompanied by Rama, went to Vrindavan: he was attended by\na troop of cowherds, and gaily decorated with wild flowers. On his way he came\nto the Yamuna, which was flowing in sportive undulations, and sparkling with\nfoam, as if with smiles, as the waves dashed against the borders. Within its\nbed, however, was the fearful pool of the serpent Kaliya, boiling with the\nfires of poison 1; from the fumes of which, large trees upon the bank were\nblighted, and by whose waters, when raised by a gale into the air, birds were\nscorched. Beholding this dreadful lake, which was like another mouth of death,\nMadhusudana reflected that the wicked and poisonous Kaliya, who had been\nvanquished by himself (in the person of Garud\xcc\x81a), and had been obliged to fly\nfrom the ocean (where he had inhabited the island Raman\xcc\x81aka), must be lurking\nat its bottom, and defiling the Yamuna, the consort of the sea, so that\nneither men nor cattle could slake their thirst by her waters. Such being the\ncase, he determined to dislodge the Naga, and enable the dwellers of Vraja to\nfrequent the vicinage without fear; for it was the especial purpose he\nconsidered of his descent upon earth to reduce to subjection all such\nviolators of law. "Here," thought he, "is a Kadamba tree, which is\nsufficiently near; I can climb up it, and thence leap into the serpent\'s\npool." Having thus resolved, he bound his clothes tightly about him, and\njumped boldly into the lake of the serpent-king. The waters, agitated by his\nplunge amidst them, were scattered to a considerable distance from the bank,\nand the spray falling upon the trees, they were immediately set on fire by the\nheat of the\n\np. 513\n\npoisonous vapour combined with the water; and the whole horizon was in a\nblaze. Krishn\xcc\x81a, having dived into the pool, struck his arms in defiance 3,\nand the snake-king, hearing the sound, quickly came forth: his eyes were\ncoppery red, and his hoods were flaming with deadly venom: he was attended by\nmany other powerful and poisonous snakes, feeders upon air, and by hundreds of\nserpent-nymphs, decorated with rich jewels, whose earrings glittered with\ntrembling radiance as the wearers moved along. Coiling themselves around\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, they all bit him with teeth from which fiery poison was emitted.\nKrishn\xcc\x81a\'s companions, beholding him in the lake, encompassed by the snakes,\ntwining around him, ran off to Vraja, lamenting and bewailing aloud his fate.\n"Krishn\xcc\x81a," they called out, "has foolishly plunged into the serpent\'s pool,\nand is there bitten to death by the snake-king! Come and see." The cowherds\nand their wives and Ya\xc5\x9boda, hearing this news, which was like a thunderbolt,\nran immediately to the pool, frightened out of their senses, and crying,\n"Alas! alas! where is he?" The Gopis were retarded by Ya\xc5\x9boda, who in her\nagitation stumbled and slipped at every step; but Nanda and the cowherds and\nthe invincible Rama hastened to the banks of the Yamuna, eager to assist\nKrishn\xcc\x81a. There they beheld him apparently in the power of the serpent-king,\nencompassed by twining snakes, and making no effort to escape. Nanda, as soon\nas he set his eyes upon his son, became senseless; and Ya\xc5\x9boda also, when she\nbeheld him, lost all consciousness. The Gopis, overcome with sorrow, wept, and\ncalled affectionately, and with convulsive sobs, upon Ke\xc5\x9bava. "Let us all,"\nsaid they, "plunge with Ya\xc5\x9boda into the fearful pool of the serpent-king. We\ncannot return to Vraja; for what is day, without the sun? what night, without\nthe moon? what is a herd of heifers, without its lord? what is Vraja, without\nKrishn\xcc\x81a? Deprived of him, we will go no more to Gokula. The forest will lose\nits delights; it will be like a lake without water. When this dark lotus leaf\ncomplexioned Hari is not present, there is no joy in the maternal dwelling.\nHow strange is this! And as for you, ye cowherds, how, poor beings, will you\nlive amidst the pastures, when you no longer\n\np. 514\n\nbehold the brilliant lotus eyes of Hari? Our hearts have been wiled away by\nthe music of his voice. We will not go without Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arikaksha to the folds of\nNanda. Even now, though held in the coils of the serpent-king, see, friends,\nhew his face brightens with smiles as we gaze upon him."\n\nWhen the mighty son of Rohin\xcc\x81i, Balarama, heard these exclamations of the\nGopis, and with disdainful glance beheld the cowherds overcome with terror,\nNanda gazing fixedly upon the countenance of his son, and Ya\xc5\x9boda unconscious,\nhe spake to Krishn\xcc\x81a in his own character: "What is this, O god of gods! the\nquality of mortal is sufficiently assumed; dost thou not know thyself eternal?\nThou art the centre of creation, as the nave is of the spokes of a wheel. A\nportion of thee have I also been born, as thy senior. The gods, to partake of\nthy pastimes as man, have all descended under a like disguise; and the\ngoddesses have come down to Gokula to join in thy sports. Thou, eternal, hast\nlast of all appeared below. Wherefore, Krishn\xcc\x81a, dost thou disregard these\ndivinities, who, as cowherds, are thy friends and kin? these sorrowing\nfemales, who also are thy relations? Thou hast put on the character of man;\nthou hast exhibited the tricks of childhood: now let this fierce snake, though\narmed with venomed fangs, be subdued (by thy celestial vigour)."\n\nThus reminded of his real character by Rama, Krishn\xcc\x81a smiled gently, and\nspeedily extricated himself from the coils of the snakes. Laying hold of the\nmiddle hood of their chief with both his hands, he bent it down, and set his\nfoot upon the hitherto unbended head, and danced upon it in triumph. Wherever\nthe snake attempted to raise his head, it was again trodden down, and many\nbruises were inflicted on the hood by the pressure of the toes of Krishn\xcc\x81a.\nTrampled upon by the feet of Krishn\xcc\x81a, as they changed position in the dance,\nthe snake fainted, and vomited forth much blood 3. Beholding the head and neck\nof their lord thus injured, and the blood flowing from his mouth, the females\nof the snake-king implored the clemency of Madhusudana. "Thou art recognised,\n\np. 515\n\n[paragraph continues] O god of gods!" they exclaimed; "thou art the sovereign\nof all; thou art light supreme, inscrutable; thou art the mighty lord, the\nportion of that supreme light. The gods themselves are unable worthily to\npraise thee, the lord self-existent: how then shall females proclaim thy\nnature? How shall we fully declare him of whom the egg of Brahma, made up of\nearth, sky, water, fire, and air, is but a small portion of a part? Holy sages\nhave in vain sought to know thy eternal essence. We bow to that form which is\nthe most subtile of atoms, the largest of the large; to him whose birth is\nwithout a creator, whose end knows no destroyer, and who alone is the cause of\nduration. There is no wrath in thee; for thine is the protection of the world;\nand hence this chastisement of Kaliya. Yet hear us. Women are to be regarded\nwith pity by the virtuous: animals are humanely treated even by fools. Let\ntherefore the author of wisdom have compassion upon this poor creature.\nThyself, as an oviparous, hooded snake, art the upholder of the world.\nOppressed by thee, he will speedily perish. What is this feeble serpent,\ncompared to thee in whom the universe reposes? Friendship and enmity are felt\ntowards equals and superiors, not for those infinitely beneath us. Then,\nsovereign of the world, have mercy upon us. This unfortunate snake is about to\nexpire: give us, as a gift of charity, our husband."\n\nWhen they had thus spoken, the Naga himself, almost exanimate, repeated feebly\ntheir solicitations for mercy. "Forgive me," the murmured, "O god of gods! How\nshall I address thee, who art possessed, through thine own strength and\nessence, of the eight great faculties, in energy unequalled? Thou art the\nsupreme, the progenitor of the supreme (Brahma): thou art the supreme spirit,\nand from thee the supreme proceeds: thou art beyond all finite objects; how\ncan I speak thy praise? How can I declare his greatness, from whom cone\nBrahma, Rudra, Chandra, Indra, the Maruts, the Aswins, the Vasus, and \xc3\x81dityas;\nof whom the whole world is an infinitely small portion, a portion destined to\nrepresent his essence; and whose nature, primitive or derived, Brahma and the\nimmortals do not comprehend? How can I approach him, to whom the gods offer\nincense and flowers culled from the groves of Nandana; whose incarnate forms\nthe king of the deities ever adores, unconscious of his real person; whom the\nsages, that have withdrawn\n\np. 516\n\ntheir senses from all external objects, worship in thought, and enshrining his\nimage in the purposes of their hearts, present to it the flowers of sanctity\n4? I am quite unable, O god of gods, to worship or to hymn thee. Thy own\nclemency must alone influence thy mind to shew me compassion. It is the nature\nof snakes to be savage, and I am born of their kind: hence this is my nature,\nnot mine offence. The world is created, as it is destroyed, by thee; and the\nspecies, form, and nature of all things in the world are thy work. Even such\nas thou hast created me in kind, in form, and in nature, such I am, and such\nare my actions: should I act differently, then indeed should I deserve thy\npunishment, for so thou hast declared 5. Yet that I have been punished by thee\nis indeed a blessing; for punishment from thee alone is a favour. Behold I am\nnow without strength, without poison; deprived of both by thee. Spare me my\nlife; I ask no more. Command me what I shall do."\n\nBeing thus addressed by Kaliya, Krishn\xcc\x81a replied, "You must not tarry here,\nnor any where in the stream of the Yamuna; depart immediately, with your\nfamily and followers, to the sea; where Garud\xcc\x81a, the foe of the serpent race,\nwill not harm you, when he sees the impressions of my feet upon your brow." So\nsaying, Hari set the snake-king at liberty, who, bowing reverentially to his\nvictor, departed to the ocean; abandoning, in the sight of all, the lake he\nhad haunted, accompanied by all his females, children, and dependants. When\nthe snake was gone, the Gopas hailed Govinda, as one risen from the dead, and\nembraced him, and bathed his forehead with tears of joy: others, contemplating\nthe water of the river, now freed from peril, were filled with wonder, and\nsang the praise of Krishn\xcc\x81a, who is unaffected by works. Thus eminent by his\nglorious exploits, and eulogized by the Gopas and Gopas, Krishn\xcc\x81a returned to\nVraja.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[512:1](vp124.htm#fr_1476) The commentator says this means nothing more than\nthat the waters of the pool were hot.
