The snarer 2 who rules alone by his powers, who rules all the worlds by\nhis powers, who is one and the same, while things arise and exist 3,--they who\nknow this are immortal.\n\n2\\. For there is one Rudra only, they do not allow a second, who rules all the\nworlds by his powers. He stands behind all persons 4, and after having created\nall worlds he, the protector, rolls it up 5 at the end of time.\n\n3 6. That one god, having his eyes, his face, his arms, and his feet in every\nplace, when producing heaven and earth, forges them together with his arms and\nhis wings 7.\n\np. 245\n\n4\\. He 1, the creator and supporter of the gods, Rudra, the great seer, the\nlord of all, he who formerly gave birth to Hira _n_ yagarbha, may he endow us\nwith good thoughts.\n\n5 2. O Rudra, thou dweller in the mountains, look upon us with that most\nblessed form of thine which is auspicious, not terrible, and reveals no evil!\n\n6 3. O lord of the mountains, make lucky that arrow which thou, a dweller in\nthe mountains, holdest in thy hand to shoot. Do not hurt man or beast!\n\n7\\. Those who know beyond this the High Brahman, the vast, hidden in the\nbodies of all creatures, and alone enveloping everything, as the Lord, they\nbecome immortal 4.\n\n8 5. I know that great person (purusha) of sunlike lustre beyond the darkness\n6. A man who knows him truly, passes over death; there is no other path to go\n7.\n\n9\\. This whole universe is filled by this person (purusha), to whom there is\nnothing superior, from whom there is nothing different, than whom there is\n\np. 246\n\nnothing smaller or larger, who stands alone, fixed like a tree in the sky 1.\n\n10\\. That which is beyond this world is without form and without suffering.\nThey who know it, become immortal, but others suffer pain indeed 2.\n\n11\\. That Bhagavat 3 exists in the faces, the heads, the necks of all, he\ndwells in the cave (of the heart) of all beings, he is all-pervading,\ntherefore he is the omnipresent _S_ iva.\n\n12\\. That person (purusha) is the great lord; he is the mover of existence 4,\nhe possesses that purest power of reaching everything 5, he is light, he is\nundecaying.\n\n13 6. The person (purusha), not larger than a thumb,\n\np. 247\n\ndwelling within, always dwelling in the heart of man, is perceived by the\nheart, the thought 1, the mind; they who know it become immortal.\n\n14 2. The person (purusha) with a thousand heads. a thousand eyes, a thousand\nfeet, having compassed the earth on every side, extends beyond it by ten\nfingers' breadth.\n\n15\\. That person alone (purusha) is all this, what has been and what will be;\nhe is also the lord of immortality; he is whatever grows by food 3.\n\n16\\. Its 4 hands and feet are everywhere, its eyes and head are everywhere,\nits ears are everywhere, it stands encompassing all in the world 5.\n\n17\\. Separate from all the senses, yet reflecting the qualities of all the\nsenses, it is the lord and ruler of all, it is the great refuge of all.\n\n18\\. The embodied spirit within the town with nine gates 6, the bird, flutters\noutwards, the ruler of\n\np. 248\n\nthe whole world, of all that rests and of all that moves.\n\n19\\. Grasping without hands, hasting without feet, he sees without eyes, he\nhears without ears. He knows what can be known, but no one knows him; they\ncall him the first, the great person (purusha).\n\n20 1. The Self, smaller than small, greater than great, is hidden in the heart\nof the creature. A man who has left all grief behind, sees the majesty, the\nLord, the passionless, by the grace of the creator (the Lord).\n\n21 2. I know 3 this undecaying, ancient one, the self of all things, being\ninfinite and omnipresent. They declare that in him all birth is stopped, for\nthe Brahma-students proclaim him to be eternal 4.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[244:1](sbe15102.htm#fr_750) This Adhyaya represents the Highest Self as the\npersonified deity, as the lord, i _s_ a, or Rudra, under the sway of his own\ncreative power, prak _ri_ ti or maya.\n\n[244:2](sbe15102.htm#fr_751) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains _g_ ala, snare, by maya. The\nverse must be corrected, according to _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's commentary:\n\nya eko _g_ alavan i _s_ ata i _s_ anibhi _h_  \nsarvan\xcc\x90 llokan i _s_ ata i _s_ anibhi _h_.\n\n[244:3](sbe15102.htm#fr_752) Sambhava, in the sense of Vergehen, perishing,\nrests on no authority.\n\n[244:4](sbe15102.htm#fr_753) Here again the MSS. A. B. read _g_ anas, as a\nvocative.\n\n[244:5](sbe15102.htm#fr_754) I prefer sa _m_ _k_ uko _k_ a to sa _m_ _k_\nukopa, which gives us the meaning that Rudra, after having created all things,\ndraws together, i.e. takes them all back into himself, at the end of time. I\nhave translated sa _m_ _s_ _ri_ _g_ ya by having created, because Boehtlingk\nand Roth give other instances of sa _m_ _s_ _ri_ _g_ with that sense.\nOtherwise, 'having mixed them together again,' would seem more appropriate. A.\nand B. read sa _m_ _k_ uko _k_ a.\n\n[244:6](sbe15102.htm#fr_755) This is a very popular verse, and occurs _Ri_\ng-veda X, 81, 3; Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XVII, 19; Ath.-veda XIII, 2, 26; Taitt. Sa\n_m_ h. IV, 6, 2, 4; Taitt. \xc3\x82r. X, 1, 3.\n\n[244:7](sbe15102.htm#fr_756) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara takes dhamati in the sense of sa _m_\nyogayati, i.e. he joins men with arms, birds with wings.\n\n[245:1](sbe15102.htm#fr_757) See IV, 12.\n\n[245:2](sbe15102.htm#fr_758) See Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XVI, 2; Taitt. Sa _m_ h.\nIV, 5, 1, 1.\n\n[245:3](sbe15102.htm#fr_759) See Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XVI, 3; Taitt. Sa _m_ h.\nIV, 5, 1, 1; Nilarudropan. p. 274.\n\n[245:4](sbe15102.htm#fr_760) The knowledge consists in knowing either that\nBrahman is \xc3\x8e _s_ a or that \xc3\x8e _s_ a is Brahman. But in either case the gender\nof the adjectives is difficult. The _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad seems to use\nb _ri_ hanta as an adjective, instead of b _ri_ hat. I should prefer to\ntranslate: Beyond this is the High Brahman, the vast. Those who know \xc3\x8e _s_ a,\nthe Lord, hidden in all things and embracing all things to be this (Brahman),\nbecome immortal. See also Muir, Metrical Translations, p. 196, whose\ntranslation of these verses I have adopted with few exceptions.\n\n[245:5](sbe15102.htm#fr_761) Cf. Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XXX, 18; Taitt. \xc3\x82r. III,\n12, 3,\n\n[245:6](sbe15102.htm#fr_762) Cf. Bhagavadgita VIII, 9.\n\n[245:7](sbe15102.htm#fr_763) Cf. _S_ vet. Up. VI, 15.\n\n[246:1](sbe15102.htm#fr_764) Divi, the sky, is explained by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara as\ndyotanatmani svamahimni.\n\n[246:2](sbe15102.htm#fr_765) The pain of sa _m_ sara, or transmigration. See B\n_ri_ had. Up. IV, 3, 20 (p. 178).\n\n[246:3](sbe15102.htm#fr_766) I feel doubtful whether the two names Bhagavat\nand _S_ iva should here be preserved, or whether the former should be rendered\nby holy, the latter by happy. The commentator explains Bhagavat by\n\nai _s_ varyasya samagrasya viryasya ya _s_ asa _h_ _s_ riya _h_  \n_G_ _\xc3\xb1_ anavairagyayo _s_ _k_ aiva sha _n_ _n_ am bhaga itira _n_ a.\n\n[paragraph continues] Wilson, in his Essay on the Religious Sects of the\nHindus, published in 1828, in the Asiatic Researches, XVI, p. 11, pointed out\nthat this verse and another ( _S_ vet. Up. II, 2) were cited by the _S_ aivas\nas Vedic authorities for their teaching. He remarked that these citations\nwould scarcely have been made, if not authentic, and that they probably did\noccur in the Vedas. In the new edition of this Essay by Dr. Rost, 1862, the\nreferences should have been added.\n\n[246:4](sbe15102.htm#fr_767) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains sattvasya by anta _h_ kara\n_n_ asya.\n\n[246:5](sbe15102.htm#fr_768) I take prapti, like other terms occurring in this\nUpanishad, in its technical sense. Prapti is one of the vibhutis or ai _s_\nvaryas, viz. the power of touching anything at will, as touching the moon with\nthe tip of one's finger. See Yoga-sutras, ed. Rajendralal Mitra, p. 121.\n\n[246:6](sbe15102.htm#fr_769) Cf. Taitt. \xc3\x82r. X, 71 (Anuv. 38, p. 858). Ka _th_.\nUp. IV, 12-13; above, p. 16.\n\n[247:1](sbe15102.htm#fr_770) The text has manvi _s_ a, which _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara\nexplains by _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ane _s_ a. But Weber has conjectured rightly, I believe,\nthat the original text must have been manisha. The difficulty is to understand\nhow so common a word as manisha could have been changed into so unusual a word\nas manvi _s_ a. See IV, 20.\n\n[247:2](sbe15102.htm#fr_771) This is a famous verse of the _Ri_ g-veda, X, 90,\n1; repeated in the Atharva-veda, XIX, 6, 1; Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XXXI, 1; Taitt.\n\xc3\x82r. III, 12, 1. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains ten fingers' breadth by endless; or, he\nsays, it may be meant for the heart, which is ten fingers above the navel.\n\n[247:3](sbe15102.htm#fr_772) Saya _n_ a, in his commentary on the Rig-veda and\nthe Taitt. \xc3\x82r., gives another explanation, viz. he is also the lord of all the\nimmortals, i.e. the gods, because they grow to their exceeding state by means\nof food, or for the sake of food.\n\n[247:4](sbe15102.htm#fr_773) The gender changes frequently, according as the\nauthor thinks either of the Brahman, or of its impersonation as \xc3\x8e _s_ a, Lord.\n\n[247:5](sbe15102.htm#fr_774) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains loka by nikaya, body.\n\n[247:6](sbe15102.htm#fr_775) Cf. Ka _th_. Up. V, 1.\n\n[248:1](sbe15102.htm#fr_776) Cf. Taitt. \xc3\x82r. X, 12 (10), p. 800; Ka _th_. Up.\nII, 20; above, p. 11. The translation had to be slightly altered, because the\n_S_ veta _s_ vataras, as Taittiriyas, read akratum for akratu _h_ , and i _s_\nam for atmana _h_.\n\n[248:2](sbe15102.htm#fr_777) Cf. Taitt. \xc3\x82r. III, 13, 1; III, 12, 7.\n\n[248:3](sbe15102.htm#fr_778) A. reads vedaru _dh_ am, not B.\n\n[248:4](sbe15102.htm#fr_779) A. and B. read brahmavadino hi pravadanti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Adhyaya IV](sbe15103.htm)\n\n"
