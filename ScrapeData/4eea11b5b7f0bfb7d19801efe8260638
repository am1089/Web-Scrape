This Temple\nwith the garden attached was dedicated by its foundress (Rani Rashmoni) to the\nDivine Mother (Kali). In the northwest corner of the spacious Temple-compound\nis a small room which faces on the west the waters of the sacred river Ganges.\nThis room with its holy surroundings was consecrated\n\np. 22\n\nas the dwelling-place for many years of Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna, whose Divine\nPresence made the spot holier and more sacred. It was from this retired corner\nthat the rays of His Divine glory, emanating from His God-intoxicated soul,\ndazzled the eyes of the seekers after Truth and attracted them to Him as a\nblazing fire attracts moths from all quarters. Hundreds of educated men and\nwomen were drawn towards this superhuman personality to listen with the\ndeepest reverence to the words of wisdom uttered by One who had realized God\nand who lived in constant communion with the Divine Mother of the universe.\n\nMahendra\'s visit to the Temple.One Sunday in the month of March, 1882,\nMahendra, hearing from a friend about this Divine Man, was so deeply impressed\nthat he came to the Temple garden to pay Him a respectful visit. It was the\nday of a special religious festival and people had gathered in great numbers\nin Sri Ramakrishna\'s room and on the veranda. The Bhagavan was seated on a\nraised platform, and on the floor around Him were Kedar, Suresh, Ram,\nManmohan, Bijoy, and many other devotees. They gazed up into His radiant face\nand drank the nectar of the living words of Divine wisdom\n\np. 23\n\nthat fell from His hallowed lips. With a smiling face Sri Ramakrishna was\nspeaking to them of the power of the Lord\'s Holy Name and true Bhakti as the\nmeans of attaining God-vision. Addressing Bijoy, * He asked: What do you say\nis the means of attaining to God?\n\nPower of the Lord\'s Holy Name.Bijoy: Bhagavan, by the repetition of His Holy\nName. In this age the Holy Name of the Lord has saving powers. Bhagavan: Yes,\nthe Holy Name has saving powers, but there must be earnest longing with it.\nWithout earnest longing of the heart no one can see God by mere repetition of\nHis Name. One may repeat His Name, but if one\'s mind be attached to lust and\nwealth, that will not help much. When a man is bitten by a scorpion or a\ntarantula, mere repetition of a _mantram_ will not do; a special remedy is\nnecessary.\n\nBijoy: If that be the case, Bhagavan, then how did Ajamila, \xe2\x80\xa0 who was the\ngreatest of\n\np. 24\n\nsinners and committed all sorts of crimes, obtain salvation by repeating the\nName of the Lord at the time of his death?\n\nRamakrishna: Perhaps in his previous incarnations Ajamila was righteous and\nperformed a great many good deeds. Besides, it is said that he practised\nasceticism later in this life. It may also be said that at the last moment of\nhis life the repetition of the Holy Name purified his heart and therefore he\nattained salvation. When an elephant is washed, immediately he throws dust and\ndirt over himself; but if he is kept in a clean stall after his bath, then he\ncannot cover himself with dirt. By the power of the Holy Name a man may be\npurified, but he may once more commit sinful acts because his mind is weak. He\ncannot promise that he will never sin again. The water of the Ganges may wash\naway past sins, but there is a saying that sins perch on the top of trees.\nWhen a man comes out of the Ganges and stands under a tree, the sins drop over\nhis shoulders and seize upon him; these old sins ride him, as it were.\nTherefore, repeat the Holy Name of the Lord,\n\np. 25\n\nbut at the same time pray to Him that you may have true love and devotion for\nHim, and that your love for wealth, fame and the pleasures of the body may\ndecrease because they are transitory, they last only until to-morrow.\n\nAll religions lead to God.When there is true devotion and love, one can reach\nGod by any of the sectarian religions. The Vaishnavas, the worshippers of\nKrishna, will attain God in the same way as the Saktas, the worshippers of the\nDivine Mother or the followers of Vedanta. Those who belong to the Brahmo-\nSamaj, * the Mahometans and Christians, will also realize God through their\nrespective religions. If you follow any of these paths with intense devotion,\nyou will reach Him. If there be any mistake in the path chosen, He will\ncorrect the mistake in the long run. The man who wishes to see Jagannath \xe2\x80\xa0 may\ngo towards the South instead of\n\np. 26\n\ntowards the North, but some one will sooner or later direct him in the right\nway and he will surely visit Jagannath in the end. The one thing necessary for\nrealization is whole-hearted and whole-souled devotion to God.\n\nMany names of one God.Vaishnavas, Mahometans, Christians and Hindus are all\nlonging for the same God; but they do not know that He who is Krishna is also\nShiva, Divine Mother, Christ and Allah. God is one, but He has many names. The\nSubstance is one, but is worshipped under different names according to the\ntime, place and nationality of His worshippers. All the different Scriptures\nof the world speak of the same God. He who is described in the Vedas as\nAbsolute Existence-Intelligence-Bliss or Brahman, is also described in the\nTantras * as Shiva, in the Puranas \xe2\x80\xa0 as Krishna, in the Koran as Allah, and in\nthe Bible as Christ. Yet\n\np. 27\n\nBigotry is not right.the various sects quarrel with one another. The\nworshippers of Krishna, for instance, say that nothing can be achieved without\nworshipping Krishna; those who are devoted to the Divine Mother think that the\nworship of the Divine Mother is the only way to salvation; similarly, the\nChristians say that no one can reach heaven except through Christ; He is the\nonly way and Christianity is the only religion, all other religions are false.\nThis is narrow-mindedness. "My religion is true while that of others is\nfalse,"--this kind of belief is not right. It is not our business to correct\nthe errors of other religions. He who has created the world will correct them\nin time. Our duty is in some way or other to realize Him. God can be reached\nthrough many paths; each of these sectarian religions points out a path which\nultimately leads to Divinity. Yes; all religions, are paths, but the paths are\nnot God. I have seen all sects and all paths. I do not care for them any more.\nPeople belonging to these sects quarrel so much! After trying all religions, I\nhave realized that God is the Whole and I am His part; that He is the Lord and\nI am His servant; again I realize, He is I; I am He.\n\np. 28\n\nGod Personal and Impersonal.People dispute among themselves, saying: "God is\npersonal, with form. He cannot be impersonal and formless,"--like the\nVaishnavas who find fault with those who worship the Impersonal Brahman. When\nrealization comes, then all these questions are settled. He who has seen God\ncan tell exactly what He is like. As Kavira * said: "God with form is my\nMother, God without form is my Father. Whom shall I blame, whom shall I\npraise? The balance is even." He is with form, yet He is formless. He is\npersonal, yet He is impersonal, and who can say what other aspects He may\nhave!\n\nParable of the elephant and the blind men.Four blind men went to see an\nelephant. One touched a leg of the elephant and said: "The elephant is like a\npillar." The second touched the trunk and said: "The elephant is like a thick\nclub." The third touched the belly and said: "The\n\np. 29\n\nelephant is like a huge jar." The fourth touched the ears and said: "The\nelephant is like a big winnowing-basket." Then they began to dispute among\nthemselves as to the figure of the elephant. A passer-by, seeing them thus\nquarrelling, asked them what it was about. They told him everything and begged\nhim to settle the dispute. The man replied: "None of you has seen the\nelephant. The elephant is not like a pillar, its legs are like pillars. It is\nnot like a big water-jar, its belly is like a water-jar. It is not like a\nwinnowing-basket, its ears are like winnowing-baskets. It is not like a stout\nclub, its trunk is like a club. The elephant is like the combination of all\nthese." In the same manner do those sectarians quarrel who have seen only one\naspect of the Deity. He alone who has seen God in all His aspects can settle\nall disputes.\n\nParable of the chameleon.Again: Two persons were hotly disputing as to the\ncolor of a chameleon. One said: "The chameleon on that palm-tree is of a red\ncolor." The other, contradicting him, replied: "You are mistaken, the\nchameleon is not red but blue." Not being able to settle the matter by\nargument, both went to the person who always lived under\n\np. 30\n\nthat tree and had watched the chameleon in all its phases of color. One of\nthem asked him: "Sir, is not the chameleon on that tree red?" The person\nreplied: "Yes, sir." The other disputant said: "What do you say? It is not\nred, it is blue." The person again humbly replied: "Yes, sir." The person knew\nthat the chameleon is an animal which constantly changes color; thus it was\nthat he said "yes" to both these conflicting statements. The Sat-chit-ananda\n(the Absolute Existence-Intelligence-Bliss) likewise has many forms. The\ndevotee who has seen God in one aspect only, knows Him in that aspect alone.\nBut he who has seen Him in manifold aspects is alone in a position to say with\nauthority: "All these forms are of one God and God is multiform." He is\nformless and with form, and many are His forms which no one knows.\n\nDifferent aspects of Divinity. God is not only personal and with form but He\ncan take the form of Krishna, Christ or any other Incarnation. It is true that\nHe manifests Himself in infinite forms to fulfil the desires of His devotees.\nIt is also true that He is formless Indivisible Existence-Intelligence-Bliss\nAbsolute. The Vedas have described Him to be both\n\np. 31\n\nRelation between God Personal and Impersonal.personal, with form and\nattributes, and impersonal, beyond all form and attributes. Do you know how\nthis is? He is like the infinite ocean of Absolute Existence-Intelligence-\nBliss. As in the ocean intense cold will freeze a portion of the water into\nice which may float in various forms on the water, similarly intense devotion\n(Bhakti) may condense a portion of Divinity and make it appear in different\nforms. The Personal God with form exists for the sake of His Bhaktas\n(dualistic devotees). When the sun of wisdom rises, the block of ice melts and\nbecomes water once more; above, below, and on every side the Infinite Being\npervades. Therefore there is a prayer in the Scriptures: "O Lord, Thou art\npersonal with form. Thou art also impersonal and formless. Thou hast\nmanifested Thyself in a human form and hast lived in our midst, but in the\nVedas Thou art described as beyond speech and mind, Unspeakable, Imperceptible\nand Unthinkable." But it can be said that for a certain class of Bhaktas He is\neternally personal and always with form. There are places where the ice never\nmelts, it becomes crystallized.\n\np. 32\n\nKedar: * Bhagavan, it is also said in the Scriptures: "O Lord, Thou art beyond\nspeech and mind, but I have described Thy Personal form only, do Thou forgive\nme for this offense."\n\nBhagavan: Yes, God is with form and also formless. No one can say positively\nthat He is so much and no more. To a devotee (Bhakta, or lover of God) the\nLord appears as a Personal Being with form, but to one who has attained to the\nstate of selfless Samadhi through the path of discrimination and knowledge He\nis the formless, Impersonal and Absolute Brahman.\n\nEvening at the Temple.Night had fallen and the priests were moving the lights\nbefore the shrines to the accompaniment of bells, cymbals, and drums. From the\nsouthern end of the garden was wafted the sweet music played by the Temple\nmusicians upon flutes and other instruments--the music being carried far over\nthe Ganges until it was lost. The breeze blowing from the south was gentle and\nfragrant with the sweet odor of many flowers. The moon was rising and the\ngarden was soon bathed in\n\np. 33\n\nits soft silvery light. It seemed as if nature as well as man was rejoicing\nand holding herself in readiness for the sacred ceremony of the \xc3\x82rati (evening\nservice).\n\nOne by one the disciples began to take their leave. Mahendra * and his friend,\nwho had been visiting the different temples, now wended their way back through\nthe grand quadrangle to Sri Ramakrishna\'s chamber. Coming up to the door of\nthe room, they noticed that it was closed. Near the door stood a maid-servant\nnamed Brinda. Mahendra spoke to her, saying: Well, my good woman, is the Holy\nMan in?\n\nBrinda: Yes, He is in His room.\n\nMahendra: I suppose He has many books to read and study?\n\nBrinda: Oh dear no; not a single one. Everything, even the highest truths, is\nspoken by His tongue. His words are all inspired.\n\np. 34\n\nMahendra: Indeed! Is He now going through he evening service? May we go in?\nWill you kindly tell Him of our anxiety to see Him?\n\nBrinda: Why, you may go in, my. children. Go in and take your seats before\nHim.\n\nThereupon they entered the room. No other people were there. Bhagavan Sri\n[Ramakrishna](errata.htm#2) was alone, seated as in the afternoon on the\nplatform beside His bed. Incense was burning and the doors were closed.\nMahendra saluted the Bhagavan with folded hands. A mat was pointed out on the\nfloor. At His word Mahendra and his friend took their seats upon it. The\nBhagavan asked him: What is your name? Where do you live? What are you? What\nhas brought you to Barahanagore? *\n\nMahendra answered each of these questions, but he noticed that in the course\nof the conversation Sri Ramakrishna\'s mind was fixed upon some other object,\non which He was meditating. He was only half-conscious of the physical plane\nand His attitude resembled that of a man quietly seated rod in hand, intent on\ncatching fish. When the float trembles and the fish bites, the man eagerly\nlooks at the float,\n\np. 35\n\ngrasping the rod with all his strength. He does not talk to anyone, but his\nwhole mind is fixed upon the float. Such was the Bhagavan\'s concentration at\nthis moment. Mahendra learned afterwards that this was the state of Samadhi or\nGod-consciousness which invariably came over Him every day during the evening\nservice. Very often in this state He would become absolutely unconscious of\nthe external world. Mahendra, observing His abstraction, said to Sri\nRamakrishna: I am afraid, Bhagavan, that Thou wouldst prefer to go through the\nevening service (Sandhya) alone. In that case we will not disturb Thee any\nmore, but will call some other time.\n\nSri Ramakrishna replied: Oh no, you need not be in a hurry.\n\nBut He was silent again for a time. He then opened His lips and said: Sandhya?\nEvening service? It is not that.\n\nA short while after, Mahendra saluted the Bhagavan, who in turn bade him good-\nbye, saying, "Come again."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[21:*](gork04.htm#fr_4) "Bhagavan" is a Sanskrit word meaning "The Blessed\nLord."
