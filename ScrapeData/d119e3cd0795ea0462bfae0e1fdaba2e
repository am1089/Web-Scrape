When he recites the Nishkevalya hymn addressed to Indra (Rv. X, 50), pra\nvo mahe, he inserts a Nivid 2 (between the fourth and fifth verses). Thus he\nclearly places strength in himself (in the _s_ astra, in the bird, in\nhimself).\n\n2\\. They are Trish _t_ ubhs and _G_ agatis.\n\np. 195\n\n3\\. There they say: 'Why does he insert a Nivid among mixed Trish _t_ ubhs and\n_G_ agatis 1?' But surely one metre would never support the Nivid of this day,\nnor fill it: therefore he inserts the Nivid among mixed Trish _t_ ubhs and _G_\nagatis.\n\n4\\. Let him know that this day has three Nivids: the Vasa hymn is a Nivid, the\nValakhilyas 2 are a Nivid, and the Nivid itself is a Nivid. Thus let him know\nthat day as having three Nivids.\n\n5\\. Then follow the hymns vane na va (Rv. X, 29) and yo _g_ ata eva (Rv. II,\n12). In the fourth verse of the former hymn occur the words anne samasya yad\nasan manisha _h_ , and they serve for the winning of proper food.\n\n6\\. Then comes an insertion. As many Trish _t_ ubh and _G_ agati verses 3,\ntaken from the ten Ma _n_ _d_ alas and addressed to Indra, as they insert\n(between the two above-mentioned hymns), after changing them into B _ri_\nhatis, so many years do they live beyond the (usual) age (of one hundred\nyears). By this insertion age is obtained.\n\n7\\. After that he recites the Sa _g_ aniya hymn, wishing that cattle may\nalways come to his offspring.\n\n8\\. Then he recites the Tarkshya hymn 4. Tarkshya is verily welfare, and the\nhymn leads to welfare. Thus (by reciting the hymn) he fares well 5.\n\np. 196\n\n9\\. Then he recites the Ekapada (indro vi _s_ va _m_ vi ra _g_ ati), wishing,\nMay I be everything at once, and may I thus finish the whole work of metres 1.\n\n10\\. In reciting the hymn indra _m_ vi _s_ va aviv _ri_ dhan (Rv. I, 11) he\nintertwines the first seven verses by intertwining their feet 2. There are\nseven pra _n_ as (openings) in the head, and he thus places seven pra _n_ as\nin the head. The eighth verse (half-verse) he does not intertwine 3. The\neighth is speech, and he thinks, May my speech never be intertwined with the\nother pra _n_ as. Speech therefore, though dwelling in the same abode as the\nother pra _n_ as, is not intertwined with them.\n\n11\\. He recites the Vira _g_ verses 4. Verily, Vira _g_ verses are food, and\nthey thus serve for the gaining of food.\n\n12\\. He ends with the hymn of Vasish _th_ a 5, wishing, May I be Vasish _th_\na!\n\n13\\. But let him end with the fifth verse, esha stomo maha ugraya vahe, which,\npossessing the word mahat, is auspicious.\n\n14\\. In the second foot of the fifth verse the word dhuri occurs. Verily, dhu\n_h_ (the place where the horse is fastened to the car) is the end (of the\ncar). This day also is the end (of the sacrifice which lasts a whole year) 6.\nThus the verse is fit for the day.\n\np. 197\n\n15\\. In the third foot the word arka is auspicious.\n\n16\\. The last foot is: 'Make our glory high as heaven over heaven.' Thus\nwherever Brahmanic speech is uttered, there his glory will be, when he who\nknows this finishes with that verse. Therefore let a man who knows this,\nfinish (the Nishkevalya) with that verse.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[194:1](sbe01199.htm#fr_482) He repeats the Sudadohas verse no more.
