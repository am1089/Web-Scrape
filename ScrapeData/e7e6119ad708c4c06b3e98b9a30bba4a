The gods enjoy a pure sacrifice (only); 1\n\n2\\. For the gods are desirous of purity and (themselves) pure.\n\n3\\. The following ( _Ri_ _k_ ) declares that, 'To you, O Maruts, the pure\nones, pure viands; to you, the pure ones, I offer a pure sacrifice. They who\nlove the pious rites, who are of pure origin, (themselves) pure and purifiers\n(of others), came duly to the truthful (worshipper).' 3\n\n4\\. (He will be) pure (if there is) no blemish on his clothes, therefore let\nhim perform all (acts) that are connected with sacrificing, (dressed) in\nunblemished clothes. 4\n\n5\\. The sacrificer and his wife as well as the officiating priests shall put\non dresses which have been washed, and dried by the wind, and which are not in\na bad condition. 5\n\np. 187\n\n6\\. (It shall be) thus from the (beginning of the) Prakrama, 6\n\n7\\. And thus at the long Soma-sacrifices and the Sattras;\n\n8\\. And (on other occasions other dresses must be used) in accordance with the\ninjunction (of the Veda),\n\n9\\. Thus at (all) Ish _t_ is, animal sacrifices, and Soma-sacrifices which may\nbe used as spells (against enemies), the priests shall perform (the sacred\nrites), wearing red turbans and red dresses; (when reciting the hymn seen by)\nV _ri_ shakapi (he shall) wear a dress and a mantle of many colours and so\nforth. 9\n\n10\\. At the Agnyadhana (sacrifice) the clothes (shall be made) of flax; on\nfailure of such, (dresses) made of cotton or of wool are used.\n\n11\\. Clothes defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen and the like (shall be)\ncleaned with earth, water and the like. 11\n\n12\\. (Dresses) made of T _ri_ pa-bark and v _ri_ kala (shall be treated) like\ncotton-cloth, 12\n\np. 188\n\n13\\. Deer-skins like (dresses) made of bark. 13\n\n14\\. (Let him) not (use) a mantle which has been wrapped (round the loins, or)\non which he has been lying (in his bed), without washing it.\n\n15: Let him not employ for the gods anything used by men without beating it on\na stone. 15\n\n16\\. If solid earth is defiled, (it must be) smeared with cowdung. 16\n\n17\\. Loose (earth must be cleansed by) ploughing,\n\n18\\. Moist (earth) by bringing pure (earth) and covering (it with that).\n\n19\\. Land is purified in four (ways), by being trod on by cows, by digging, by\nlighting a fire on it, by rain falling on it,\n\n20\\. Fifthly by smearing it with cowdung, and sixthly through (the lapse of)\ntime.\n\n21\\. Grass placed on unconsecrated ground (must be) washed. 21\n\n22\\. (Grass) defiled out of one's sight, (shall be) sprinkled (with water). 22\n\n23\\. Small pieces of sacred fuel (shall be purified) in the same manner.\n\n24\\. Large pieces of wood (must be) washed and dried.\n\np. 189\n\n25\\. But a great quantity (of wood shall be) sprinkled (with water).\n\n26\\. Wooden vessels which have been touched by impure men (shall be) scraped;\n\n27\\. (And) those which are defiled by stains of remnants (shall be) planed. 27\n\n28\\. (Wooden vessels) defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, and the like\n(very impure substances shall be) thrown away. 28\n\n29\\. These (rules must be followed) except in case a (special) injunction (is\ngiven);\n\n30\\. Thus, for instance, (purification by) washing with Ku _s_ a grass and\nwater (is prescribed) on all the following (occasions, viz.) at the Agnihotra,\nthe Gharmo _k_ _kh_ ish _t_ a, the Dadhigharma, the Ku _n_ _d_ apayinam Ayana,\nthe Utsargi _n_ am Ayana, the Dakshaya _n_ a sacrifice, the Ardhodaya, the _K_\natu _s_ _k_ akra, and the Brahmaudanas, 30\n\n31\\. (Again) at all Soma-sacrifices (the cups must be) cleaned with water only\non (the heap of earth called) the Mar _g_ aliya;\n\n32\\. If these same (cups are defiled) by urine, ordure, 32\n\np. 190\n\nblood, semen, and the like (they must be) thrown away.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[186:1](sbe1446.htm#fr_932)-2. **13**. See also above, I, 5, 10, 4. This\nAdhyaya and the next ought to have been given in the _S_ rauta Sutra.\n\n[186:3](sbe1446.htm#fr_933) Rig-veda VII, 56, 12; Taittiriya-brahma _n_ a II,\n8, 5, 5. The meaning of the last portion of the verse is somewhat doubtful.\nSaya _n_ a gives two different explanations and Govinda a third.\n\n[186:4](sbe1446.htm#fr_934) Govinda points out that the dresses of the\nsacrificer and of his priests must be white, because farther on (Sutras 9-10)\nother colours are specially prescribed.\n\n[186:5](sbe1446.htm#fr_935) Govinda thinks that the word _k_ a, 'as well as,'\nis intended to include the lookers-on.\n\n[187:6](sbe1446.htm#fr_936) Regarding the ceremony called Prakrama, literally\n'stepping forward from the Garhapatya fire,' see Saya _n_ a on Taitt. Br. I,\n1, 4, 1. It opens the Agnyadhana rite.\n\n[187:9](sbe1446.htm#fr_937) Govinda states that the words iti ka, and so\nforth,' are intended to include other incantations. The V _ri_ shakapi hymn is\nfound Rig-veda X, 86.\n\n[187:11](sbe1446.htm#fr_938) Govinda states that the word iti, 'and the like,'\nis intended to include cowdung, cow's urine, and other substances used for\npurification.\n\n[187:12](sbe1446.htm#fr_939) Govinda states that there is a tree called T _ri_\npa, the bark of which is used for dresses. V _ri_ kala, which has been left\nuntranslated, is explained by _s_ akama, a word which is not found in our\ndictionaries.\n\n[188:13](sbe1446.htm#fr_940) Govinda says that, as the treatment of valkala,\nbark-dresses,' has not been prescribed, the meaning of the Sutra can only be,\nthat bark-dresses and black-buck skins are to be treated alike, i.e. that they\nare to be cleaned with Bel-nut and rice; see above.\n\n[188:15](sbe1446.htm#fr_941) Govinda explains apalpulitam by 'without beating\nit with the hand on a stone.' He mentions as an instance the skin which is\nused in preparing the Soma.\n\n[188:16](sbe1446.htm#fr_942) According to Govinda, solid earth is such on\nwhich the fire-altars are built.\n\n[188:21](sbe1446.htm#fr_943) E.g. grass intended for the barhis, if it has\nbeen placed on a spot which has not been sprinkled with water.\n\n[188:22](sbe1446.htm#fr_944) 'Defiled out of one's sight,' i.e. brought by _S_\nudras.\n\n[189:27](sbe1446.htm#fr_945) Govinda says that this rule is optional.\n\n[189:28](sbe1446.htm#fr_946) Govinda adds that fuel, Ku _s_ a grass, and the\nlike, which have been defiled in this manner, must also be thrown away.\n\n[189:30](sbe1446.htm#fr_947) Regarding the Dadhigharma, a homa, see Vaitana\nSutra 21,18; regarding the Ku _n_ _d_ apayinam Ayana, \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana _S_ rauta\nSutra XII, 4; and regarding the Dakshaya _n_ a sacrifice, a variety of the new\nand full-moon offering, \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana II, 14. The Ardhodaya is possibly the\nvrata of that name mentioned in the Pura _n_ as, According to Govinda, the _K_\natu _s_ _k_ akra, which is otherwise known as a Tantric rite, is a sacrifice,\nish _t_ akakosh _t_ a (?) madhyavasanto ya _g_ ante tathetaradaya _h_ (?).\nRegarding the Brahmaudana, see \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana _S_ rauta Sutra I, 4.\n\n[189:32](sbe1446.htm#fr_948) Govinda says that the injunction to throw away\ndefiled p. 191 vessels has been repeated, in order to prevent a misconception.\nFor as Soma is said to be a great means of purification, it might be supposed\nthat it was powerful enough to prevent the defilement of vessels into which it\nis poured at a sacrifice. But compare the next Sutras.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 6, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 14](sbe1447.htm)\n\n"
