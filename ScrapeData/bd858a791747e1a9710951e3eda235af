What we read in old histories and Holy Bibles, and the records, can\nbe seen there today.\n\nIn India there are Yogis who perform such marvelous feats that Doctors,\nScientists and Chemists are unable to solve them, and I may say, are unable to\nunderstand them. For instance, such feats, as lying down upon blazing logs of\nfire; walking over red hot fire that has been especially prepared by burning\nten tons of wood,--twenty men walked over this without a burn--not even a hair\non their feet; also feats of levitation, walking on water, etc., equally as\nastonishing.\n\nYogi Haridas, at Lahore, willingly permitted\n\np. 10\n\nhimself to be buried alive for forty days under fifteen feet of earth. After\nthat length of time, he was taken out as normal as ever. Such as that, and\nstanding on one leg for years; head buried in the earth with both legs up in\nthe air for days; living without food for forty years,--these and many other\nthings can be seen in India today.\n\nAny one wishing to read further about this may obtain the author\'s booklet\nentitled: "Marvelous feats performed by Yogis through Yoga."\n\nI have received many letters asking: "How can that be done?" The answer is,\nthey always do this through the Kundalini (The Divine Mother) by awakening her\nfrom her sleep, for then any one can have supernatural power--this is her gift\nwith unfoldment.\n\n"Kundalini the Giver of Health"; "Kundalini the Giver of Wealth"; "Kundalini\nthe Giver of Joy and Happiness"; "Kundalini the Giver of Faith"; "Kundalini\nthe Giver of Bliss, Life, and Powers."\n\nBy awakening her, seeming miracles can be performed by men and women. The\nresurrection came as a living faith; see "The Great Masters of the Himalayas"\n--by the author.\n\np. 11\n\nThe Kundalini is always back of all powers and feats of seeming miracles. She\nis the All in All.\n\nSwami Vivekananda says: "Whenever there is any manifestation of what is\nordinarily called supernatural power or wisdom, there must have been a little\n(control over the) current of Kundalini which found its way into the Sushumna.\nOnly, in the vast majority of such cases of supernaturalism, they ignorantly\nstumble on some practice which set free, (and made them conscious of) a minute\nportion, (of the control) of the coiled up Kundalini."\n\nThe Kundalini (Divine Mother), always keeps for herself a chosen country, in\nwhich her higher wisdom is preserved from all dangers.\n\nThat land is India. When she wanted to see the play of helplessness, weakness\nand ignorance of the world, she chose that land. When the Kundalini again\nwants to raise up from ignorance to Mighty Wisdom, and a Blissful state, she\nchooses India again, for the purpose of raising India once more to the highest\nof Pure Wisdom.\n\nIn ages past the greatest Avatars, of India--Sri Rama Chandar, Ram Sri, Sri\nKrishna,\n\np. 12\n\n[paragraph continues] King Janak, [Yajnavalkya](errata.htm#1), Guru\n[Nanak](errata.htm#2), Buddha and countless others. The present day we have\nSaint Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nWhy does the Kundalini choose India? To perfect her being and for the purpose\nof perfecting harmony. That only can save the world from misery of selfishness\nand hate.\n\nOnly India can find harmony. That harmony is by change of heart. Such change\nand harmony comes by Yoga. Yoga can and will change the mind, heart, and\naction; this change is from within; not from without.\n\nNot by politics nor by creeds but by the realization of the Goddess Kundalini,\nremodeling life by pure Wisdom--not by knowledge. This Divine Harmony is not\nalone for suffering humanity, but for even the smallest insects, animals, etc.\n\nThat change of heart, that Blessed Harmony, the son of Mother India, Mahatma\nGandhi, has shown the world.\n\nHave I lost my sense of understanding to make a statement about India? Not so,\nI am conscious and seeing with clear vision. The India that has kept true to\nSpirituality, in the past ages against all storms of material opposition, is\nnow the chosen land of Mother Kundalini.\n\np. 13\n\nI sincerely trust that my many friends and seekers of Truth, who are looking\nto California for the future Spiritual Teacher of the world, will not be hurt\nby the above statement. Truth is Truth, although it hurts many, many times.\n\n"Lo, in the East this Wisdom\'s showering Light  \nAdorable, hath sprung from out the night;  \nNow may the Dawns, heaven daughters, spread  \nShining afar, a path for man to tread."\n\n______________\n\n"If I were to look over the whole world to find out the country most richly\nendowed with all the wealth, power and beauty that nature can bestow, in some\nparts a very paradise on earth--I should point to India. If I were asked under\nwhat sky the human mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts,\nhas most deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life, and has found\nsolutions of some of them which well deserved the attention even of those who\nhave studied Plato and Kant, I should point to India. If I were to ask myself\nfrom\n\np. 14\n\nwhat literature we, here in Europe, may draw the corrective which is most\nwanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more universal, in fact\nmore truly human, again I should point to India."\n\n--MAX MULLER.\n\nPope Pius IX says:--"India alone has remained true to the heart of the\nspiritual motives." (From Sir Woodroffe\'s book--"Is India Civilized?")\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Yoga and its Object](kmu04.htm)\n\n'
