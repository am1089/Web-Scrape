Then\nShree Krishnu Chund and Raja Joodisthur together behaved with the utmost\naffability to all the Rajas, and made all the arrangements, and entrusted each\nwith a specific duty in the sacrifice. After this, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee\nsaid to the Raja Joodisthur, "O great king! we five brothers, Bheem, Urjoon,\nNukool, Suhdeo and myself, together with the other Rajas, will do all the\nextraneous work, and do you be so good as to send for the sages, priests and\nbrahmins, and begin the sacrifice."\n\nO great king! on hearing these words, Raja Joodisthur, having summoned all the\npriests, sages, and brahmins, said, "O great kings! order all things necessary\nfor the sacrifice." At these words, the priests, sages and brahmins, having\nconsulted their holy books, wrote down on a paper a list of all the articles\nrequired; and the Raja caused them to be procured immediately, and placed\nbefore them. The priests,\n\np. 373\n\nsages and brahmins together erected an altar for the sacrifice. The priests,\nsages and brahmins, of the four Vedas, having spread their seats, sat down in\nthe middle of the altar; then Raja Joodisthur, having purified himself, came\nand sat down there also with his wife, the skirts of their mantles, being tied\ntogether as at a bridal. And Dronahcharuj, Kripacharuj, Dritrasht, Doorjodhun,\nSissoopal and all the other mighty men, and great Rajas came and sat there\nalso. The brahmins, having strewed boiled rice, and prayed for the blessings\nof the gods on the ceremony about to be performed; and, having caused Gunesh\nto be worshipped, made an offering of a jar of water, with the twigs of five\nsacred trees placed in it, and invoked the nine planets. The Raja hired for\nthe performance of the religious ceremonies Bhurdooaj, Goutum, Bisist,\nBiswamittru, Bamdeo, Purasur, Byas, Kusyp and other great priests, sages and\nbrahmins; who, having repeated incantations from the Vedas, summoned all the\ngods; and, having caused the Raja to make a vow of giving alms of the\nsacrifice, they began to prepare the burnt offerings.\n\nO great king! having repeated the incantations, the priests; sages and\nbrahmins began to offer oblations with fire to the deities; and the gods,\nopenly extending their hands began to receive them; at that time the brahmins\nwere reading the Vedas, and all the Rajas brought the different materials of\nthe burnt offerings, and presented them to the brahmins, and the Raja\nJoodisthur was engaged with the burnt offerings, when the sacrifice was\npeaceably completed, and the Raja gave the. final oblation. At that time,\ngods, men and sages began to utter exclamations of praise of all the Rajas;\nand the demigods, celestial musicians, and choristers began to play upon\nmusical instruments, celebrate their fame in songs, and rain down flowers.\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! being free from all the business of the sacrifice,\nRaja Joodisthur, having sent\n\np. 374\n\nfor Suhdeo Jee, enquired, "Whose adoration shall we perform first; to whom\nshall we give unbroken rice and marks upon the forehead? Who is the great lord\nof the gods, to whom we may bow the head, and offer worship?" Suhdeo Jee said,\n"O great king! Basoodeo is the god of all the gods; no one understands his\nnature; he is the lord of Bruhmu, Roodru and Indru; but be pleased to worship\nand bow the head to him first, as by giving water to the root of a tree, all\nthe branches become green, so all the gods are gratified by adoration being\noffered to Huri, he is the lord of the universe, and he creates, preserves and\ndestroys; his pastimes are endless; no one knows the end of them; he is the\nunseen, invisible and impenetrable lord; Luchmee having become a servant,\nconstantly attends upon his lotus feet; he descends upon the earth continually\nfor the sake of his worshippers; and, assuming corporeal form, appears and\nacts like a mortal; he comes and sits in our houses, and calls us \'brothers;\'\nand fascinates us with his delusive power; we being deluded by great\nfascination and affection, consider the deity as a brother; we have not seen\nany one so great as him, let him be first worshipped."\n\nO great king! on hearing this speech, all the saints, sages and Rajas\nexclaimed, "Raja! Suhdeo Jee has spoken truly, Huri is worthy of our first\nadoration." Then Raja Joodisthur having seated Shree Krishnu Chund Jee upon a\nthrone, together with his eight queens, offered adoration to him, presenting\nsandal, unbroken rice, flowers, perfume, lamps and consecrated food; after\nthis he worshipped all the gods, saints, sages, brahmins and Rajas, arrayed\nthem in dresses of different colours, made marks upon their foreheads with\nsandal and saffron, decorated them with garlands of flowers, and sprinkling\nperfume, the Raja, with due observance of what was right and fitting, behaved\nto them all with the most engaging politeness.\n\np. 375\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja! all were pleased with the adoration of Huri,\nexcept Sissoopal, who hung down his head for a long time, he kept his head\nbent towards the ground, and remained thoughtful and reflecting; at length,\nbeing in the hands of death, he descended very angrily from his throne into\nthe middle of the assembly; and, laying aside all reserve and fear, said, "In\nthis assembly are Dritrasht, Doorjodhun, Bheekhum, Kurun, Dronachuruj and\nothers, men of great knowledge and dignity of character; but their rank and\nunderstanding have, on this occasion, been entirely overlooked. Great chiefs\nof saints and sages have been sitting here, whilst adoration has been offered\nto the son of the cowherd, Nund, and no one has said any thing; he who was\nborn in Bruj, and has eaten the leavings of the cowherds\' children\'s prepared\nfood, has, in this assembly, received high honour and exaltation. All here\nthoughtlessly call him great, they bestow the strength of the lord of the gods\nupon a crow, they have in this assembly made him the most holy of men, who\nfixed his affections on cowherdesses and herdsmen\'s wives; all in a body have\ncelebrated the praises of him, who stole from every house, and ate milk,\ncurds, butter-milk and butter; respect has here been paid to him, who received\nalms on the roads, and ghauts; all have advisedly made the honorary marks\nfirst on his forehead, who, by force and stratagem, has enjoyed himself with\nother men\'s wives. This is he, who abolished the worship of Indru in Bruj and\nestablished the worship of a mountain; and afterwards he was not ashamed to\nplay off a trick, and eat up all the different confections and things he had\ncaused to be brought near the mountain for the worship of Indru. All have here\nregarded, as invisible and immortal, him, whose pedigree, parentage and family\nare certainly known."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O great king! in this manner Raja Sissoopal being in the\npower of death, was casting many\n\np. 376\n\nreproaches upon Shree Krishnu Chund Jee, who, seated on a throne in the midst\nof the assembly, listened, and drew a line for every reproach that was\nuttered; in the mean while Bheekum, Kurun, Dron and other great Rajas, having\nheard Huri spoken of disparagingly, were very angry, and said to Sissoopal,\n"Fool! dost thou in the midst of this assembly in our presence speak\ndisparagingly of Krishnu? O mean, low caste wretch! be silent, otherwise we\nwill immediately throw you down, and put you to death."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, all the Rajas seizing their weapons, rose up\nand rushed towards Sissoopal to kill him. Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of\njoy, then prevented them, and said, "Do not use your [arms](errata.htm#21)\nagainst him, stand here and look on, he will bring destruction on himself\npresently, I will tolerate a hundred offences in him, because I have agreed to\ndo so; but I will not tolerate more than a hundred, and therefore I have been\ndrawing these lines."\n\nO great king! on hearing this speech, all, having joined their hands, enquired\nfrom Shree Krishnu Chund, "O lord of compassion! what is the reason that you\nwill pardon a hundred faults on his part, be pleased kindly to explain to us,\nthat the doubts of our minds may be removed?" Krishnu said, When he\n(Sissoopal) was born, he had three eyes and four arms, when his father, Raja\nDumadhok, was informed of this he sent for astrologers and great pundits and\nenquired, \'What sort of child will this be, consider and give me your answer?\'\nOn hearing what the Raja said, the pundits and astrologers, having consulted\nthe Shastrus, replied, \'O great king! this child will be possessed of great\nstrength, and will be highly renowned, and we are also of opinion that this\nchild will be destroyed by him, at meeting with whom one of his eyes and two\nof his arms shall fall down.\' Having heard this, his mother, Muhadewee, the\ndaughter of Soorsen, the sister of Basoodeo, my maternal aunt, was very sad,\nand passed day and night in anxious thought about her child; after some days,\n\np. 377\n\nshe came on one occasion with her son to her father\'s house at Dwarka, and\npresented her son to every one; when the child and I met, one of its eyes, and\ntwo of its arms fell upon the ground, then my aunt having bound me by a\npromise, said, \'The child\'s death is in your hands, please do not kill it, I\nask this as an alms from you.\' I replied, \'Very good, I will not reckon a\nhundred faults he may commit, should he commit any in excess of this number, I\nwill destroy him.\' Having received this promise from me, my aunt took leave of\nus all with these words, \'How can the child commit a hundred offences against\nKrishnu and perish by his hand,\' and returned home with her son."\n\nO great king! having mentioned this account of Sissoopal, and obliterated the\ndoubts of all the Rajas\' minds, Shree Krishnu Jee counted the lines he had\ndrawn separately for each offence, which amounted to more than a hundred.\nKrishnu then gave an order to the quoit, Soodursen, who instantly cut off\nSissoopal\'s head. The brilliant light, which came forth from his body, went at\nonce to the sky, and returning thence settled in the sight of all, on the\nmouth of Shree Krishnu Chund. On beholding this exploit, gods, men and sages\nbegan to raise cries of exultation and rain flowers. On that occasion, Shree\nMoorari, the benefactor of his worshippers, gave him a third deliverance, and\nperformed his funeral obsequies.\n\nHaving heard thus much of the narrative, Raja Pureechit enquired from Shree\nShookdeo Jee,--"O great king! please explain to me, how Krishnu gave Sissoopal\na third deliverance?" Shookdeo Jee replied,--Raja! once he appeared as\nHirunkusyp, and then Krishnu having descended upon the earth as half lion,\nhalf man, released him. On the second occasion he became Rawun, when Huri\nhaving descended as Ram, liberated him, the present is the third occasion, and\ntherefore the present is the third release. Having heard this, the Raja said\nto the sage,--"O great king! be pleased now to proceed with the narrative."\nShree Shookdeo Jee,\n\np. 378\n\nsaid,--Raja! when the sacrifice was finished, Raja Joodisthur bestowed dresses\non all the Rajas and their wives, and numberless gifts on brahmins. It was the\nbusiness of Raja Doorjodhun to distribute during the sacrifice, who, in place\nof distributing once, distributed many times, and thereby acquired celebrity,\nbut was still dissatisfied.\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit, O\ngreat king! on the completion of the sacrifice, Shree Krishnu Jee took leave\nof the Raja Joodisthur, accompanied by his army and relatives, and went from\nHustinapoor to the city of Dwarka. On the arrival of Krishnu, there were\nfestive rejoicings in every house, and joy was diffused throughout the city.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXVI](psa77.htm)\n\n'
