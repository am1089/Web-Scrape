And on account of the difference of characteristics.\n\nThere is moreover a difference of characteristics between the chief pra _n_ a\nand the other pra _n_ as. When speech &c. are asleep, the chief pra _n_ a\nalone is awake. The chief pra _n_ a alone is not reached by death, while the\nother pra _n_ as are. The staying and departing of the chief pra _n_ a--not\nthat of the sense-organs--is the cause of the maintenance and the destruction\nof the body. The sense-organs, on the other hand, are the cause of the\nperception of the sense-objects, not the chief pra _n_ a. Thus there are\nmanifold differences distinguishing the pra _n_ a from the senses, and this\nalso shows the latter to be different in being from the pra _n_ a--To infer\nfrom the passage, 'thereupon they all assumed his form,' that the sense-organs\nare nothing but pra _n_ a is wrong, because there also an examination of the\ncontext makes us understand their difference. For there the sense-organs are\nenumerated first ('Voice held, I shall speak,' &c.); after that it is said\nthat speech, &c. were seized by death in the form of weariness ('Death having\nbecome weariness held them back; therefore speech grows weary'); finally pra\n_n_ a is mentioned separately as not having been overcome by death ('but death\ndid not seize the central breath'), and is\n\np. 96\n\nasserted to be the best ('he is the best of us'). The assuming of the form of\npra _n_ a has therefore, in accordance with the quoted passages, to be\nunderstood to mean that the energizing of speech and so on depends on the pra\n_n_ a, but not that they are identical with it.--Hence it follows that the\nword 'pra _n_ a is applied to the sense-organs in a secondary sense. Thus _S_\nruti also says, 'Thereupon they all assumed his form, and therefore they are\ncalled after him pra _n_ as;' a passage declaring that the word pra _n_ a,\nwhich properly refers to the chief pra _n_ a is secondarily applied to the\nsense-organs also. Speech and the other sense-organs are therefore different\nin being from the pra _n_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 20](sbe38074.htm)\n\n"
