Not manifesting itself; on account of the connexion.\n\nIn the text discussed above we meet with the word 'balya,' which may mean\neither 'being a child' or 'being and doing like a child.' The former meaning\nis excluded, as that particular age which is called childhood cannot be\nassumed at will. With regard to the latter meaning, however, a doubt arises,\nviz. whether the text means to say that he who aims at perfect knowledge is to\nassume all the ways of a child, as e.g. its wilful behaviour, or only its\nfreedom from pride and the like.--The former, the Purvapakshin maintains. For\nthe text gives no specification, and texts enjoining restraints of different\nkinds (on the man desirous of knowledge) are sublated by this specific text\nwhich enjoins him to be in all points like a child.--This view the Sutra\ndisposes of. 'Not manifesting itself.' That aspect of a child's nature which\nconsists in the child not manifesting its nature (viz. in pride, arrogance,\nand so on), the man aiming at true knowledge is to make his own. 'On account\nof connexion,' i.e. because thus only the 'balya' of the text gives a possible\nsense. The other characteristic features of 'childhood' the texts declare to\nbe opposed to knowledge, 'He who has not turned away from wicked conduct, who\nis not tranquil and attentive, or whose mind is not at peace, he can never\nattain the Self by knowledge' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 24); 'When food is pure, the\nwhole nature becomes pure' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 26, 2), and so on.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'non-manifestation.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 50.
