And on account of difference of nature (they are) not like dreams.\n\nOwing to the different nature of dream-cognitions, it cannot be said that,\nlike them, the cognitions of the waking state also have no things to\ncorrespond to them. For dream-cognitions are originated by organs impaired by\ncertain defects, such as drowsiness, and are moreover sublated by the\ncognitions of the waking state; while the cognitions of the waking state are\nof a contrary nature. There is thus no equality between the two sets.--\nMoreover, if all cognitions are empty of real content, you are unable to prove\nwhat you wish to prove since your inferential cognition also is devoid of true\ncontent. If, on the other hand, it be held to have a real content, then it\nfollows that no cognition is devoid of such content; for all of them are alike\ncognitions, just like the inferential cognition.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 29.
