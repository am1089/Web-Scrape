And on account of the cessation of the preceding one on the origination\nof the subsequent one.\n\nFor the following reason also the origination of the world cannot be accounted\nfor on the view of the momentariness of all existence. At the time when the\nsubsequent momentary existence originates, the preceding momentary existence\nhas passed away, and it cannot therefore stand in a causal relation towards\nthe subsequent one. For if non-existence had causal power, anything might\noriginate at any time at any place.--Let it then be said that what constitutes\na cause is nothing else but existence in a previous moment.--But, if this were\nso, the previous momentary existence of a jar, let us say, would be the cause\nof all things whatever that would be met with in this threefold world in the\nsubsequent moment-cows, buffaloes, horses, chairs, stones, &c.!--Let us then\nsay that a thing existing in a previous moment is the cause only of those\nthings, existing in the subsequent moment, which belong to the same species.--\nBut from this again it would follow that one jar existing in the previous\nmoment would be the cause of all jars, to be met with in any place, existing\nin\n\np. 504\n\nthe following moment!--Perhaps you mean to say that one thing is the cause of\none subsequent thing only. But how then are we to know which thing is the\ncause of which one subsequent thing?--Well then I say that the momentarily\nexisting jar which exists in a certain place is the cause of that one\nsubsequent momentary jar only which exists at the very same place!--Very good,\nthen you hold that a place is something permanent! (while yet your doctrine is\nthat there is nothing permanent).--Moreover as, on your theory, the thing\nwhich has entered into contact with the eye or some other sense-organ does no\nlonger exist at the time when the idea originates, nothing can ever be the\nobject of a cognition.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 20.
