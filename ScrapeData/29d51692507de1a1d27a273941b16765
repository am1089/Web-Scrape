That Brahma _n_ a, who is wise and recognises all creatures to be in the\n\xc3\x82tman, who pondering (thereon) does not become bewildered, and who recognises\nthe \xc3\x82tman in every (created) thing, shines, indeed, in heaven.\n\n2\\. He, who is intelligence itself and subtler than the thread of the lotus-\nfibre, pervades the universe, and who, unchangeable and larger than the earth,\ncontains the universe; he, who is different from the knowledge of this world,\nobtained by the senses and identical with its objects, possesses the highest\n(form consisting of absolute knowledge). From him, who divides himself, spring\nall (created) bodies. He is the primary cause, he is eternal, he is\nunchangeable. 2\n\np. 78\n\n3\\. But the eradication of the faults is brought about in this life by the\nmeans (called Yoga). A wise man who has eradicated the (faults) which destroy\nthe creatures, obtains salvation.\n\n4\\. Now we will enumerate the faults which tend to destroy the creatures.\n\n5\\. (These are) anger, exultation, grumbling, covetousness, perplexity, doing\ninjury, hypocrisy, lying, gluttony, calumny, envy, lust, secret hatred,\nneglect to keep the senses in subjection, neglect to concentrate the mind. The\neradication of these (faults) takes place through the means of (salvation\ncalled) Yoga.\n\n6\\. Freedom from anger, from exultation, from grumbling, from covetousness,\nfrom perplexity, from hypocrisy (and) hurtfulness; truthfulness, moderation in\neating, silencing a slander, freedom from envy, self-denying liberality,\navoiding to accept gifts, uprightness, affability, extinction of the passions,\nsubjection of the senses, peace with all created beings, concentration (of the\nmind on the contemplation of the \xc3\x82tman), regulation of one's conduct according\nto that of the \xc3\x82ryas, peacefulness and contentedness;--these (good qualities)\nhave been settled by the agreement (of the wise) for all (the four) orders; he\nwho, according to the precepts of the sacred law, practises these, enters the\nuniversal soul.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[77:2](sbe0226.htm#fr_453) **23**. This Sutra again contains a description of\nthe Paramatman. The translation strictly follows the commentary, though the\nexplanation, given in the latter, is open to objections.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 9, Kha _n_ _d_ a 24](sbe0227.htm)\n\n"
