In disputed cases the truth shall be established by means of witnesses. 1\n\n2\\. The (latter) shall be many, faultless as regards the performance of their\nduties, worthy to be trusted by the king, and free from affection for, or\nhatred against either (party). 2\n\n3\\. (They may be) _S_ udras even. 3\n\n4\\. But a Brahma _n_ a must not be forced (to give evidence) at the word of a\nnon-Brahma _n_ a, except if he is mentioned (in the plaint). 4\n\n5\\. (Witnesses) shall not speak singly or without being asked, 5\n\n6\\. And if, (being asked,) they do not answer, they are guilty of a crime. 6\n\n7\\. Heaven is their reward, if they speak the 7\n\np. 247\n\ntruth; in the contrary case hell (will be their portion).\n\n8\\. (Persons) not mentioned (in the plaint), must also give evidence.\n\n9\\. No objection (can be raised against witnesses) in a case of (criminal)\nhurt, 9\n\n10\\. Nor if they have spoken inadvertently. 10\n\n11\\. If the sacred law or the rules (referring to worldly matters) are\nviolated,. the guilt (falls) on the witnesses, the assessors, the king, and on\nthe offender. 11\n\n12\\. Some (declare, that the witnesses) shall be charged on oath to speak the\ntruth. 12\n\n13\\. In the case of others than Brahma _n_ as that (oath shall be sworn) in\nthe presence of the gods, of the king, and of Brahma _n_ as.\n\n14\\. By false evidence concerning small cattle a witness kills ten, 14\n\n15\\. (By false evidence) regarding cows, horses, men, or land, in each\nsucceeding case ten times as many (as in the one mentioned before),}\n\np. 248\n\n16\\. Or (by false evidence) regarding land the whole (human race).\n\n17\\. Hell (is the punishment) for a theft of land.\n\n18\\. (By false evidence) concerning water (he incurs) the same (guilt) as (for\nan untruth) about land,\n\n19\\. Likewise (by false evidence) regarding (criminal) intercourse.\n\n20\\. (By false evidence) regarding honey or clarified butter (he incurs) the\nsame (guilt) as (by an untruth) about small cattle,\n\n21\\. (By false evidence) about clothes, gold, grain, and the Veda, the same as\n(by an untruth) about kine,\n\n22\\. (And by false evidence) regarding a carriage (or a beast of burden) the\nsame as (by an untruth) about horses.\n\n23\\. A witness must be reprimanded and punished for speaking an untruth. 23\n\n24\\. No guilt is incurred by giving false evidence, in case the life (of a\nman) depends thereon. 24\n\n25\\. But (this. rule does) not (hold good) if the life of a very wicked (man\ndepends on the evidence of a witness).\n\n26\\. The king, or the judge, or a Brahma _n_ a learned in the _S_ astras\n(shall examine the witnesses). 26\n\n27\\. (The litigant) shall humbly go to seek the judge. 27\n\np. 249\n\n28\\. If (the defendant) is unable to answer (the plaint) at once, (the judge)\nmay wait for a year. 28\n\n29\\. But (in an action) concerning kine, draught oxen, women, or the\nprocreation (of offspring), the defendant (shall answer) immediately, 29\n\n30\\. Likewise in a case that will suffer by delay.\n\n31\\. To speak the truth before the judge is more important than all (other)\nduties.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[246:1](sbe0277.htm#fr_1194) **XIII**.

If a man other than a Brahma _n_ a says: "This Brahma _n_ a is a\nwitness of this fact," then the ( _S_ rotriya) shall not be forced to become,\ni.e. not be taken as a witness, provided he has not been mentioned, i.e. he\nhas not been entered in the written plaint (as one of the witnesses). But if\nhe has been entered in the plaint, he certainly becomes a witness.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[246:5](sbe0277.htm#fr_1198) Manu VIII, 79; Macnaghten, Mitakshara VI, 1, 21.\nIn the Mitakshara the Sutra is read nasamaveta _h_ p _ri_ sh _t_ a _h_\nprabruyu _h_ , \'witnesses need not answer if they are examined singly.\'\nMitrami _s_ ra in the Viramitrodaya says that Haradatta\'s reading of the text\nis the same, and that his explanation does not agree with it.\n\n[246:6](sbe0277.htm#fr_1199) Manu VIII, 107; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 76-77.\n\n[246:7](sbe0277.htm#fr_1200) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 11, 29, 9-10.\n\n[247:9](sbe0277.htm#fr_1201) Manu VIII, 72; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 72.\n\n[247:10](sbe0277.htm#fr_1202) \'Negligence, i.e. inadvertence.

The translation follows\nHaradatta. Perhaps it would, however, be as well to take dharmatantra, \'the\nsacred law and the rules referring to worldly matters,\' as a Tatpurusha, and\nto translate, \'If there is a miscarriage of justice, the guilt,\' &c.\n\n[247:12](sbe0277.htm#fr_1204)-13. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 11, 29, 7.\n\n[247:14](sbe0277.htm#fr_1205)-22. Manu VIII, 98-100. \'By speaking an untruth\nregarding them, the witness kills ten. Ten what? Even ten (of that kind)\nregarding which he has lied. His guilt is as great as if he actually killed\nten of them, and the punishment. (is the same). \'Equal penances must also be\nprescribed for both cases.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[248:23](sbe0277.htm#fr_1206) Manu VIII, 119-123; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 81.\n\'Yapya _h_ (literally "must be turned out") means "must be reprimanded" in the\npresence of the whole audience, lest anybody have intercourse with him.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[248:24](sbe0277.htm#fr_1207)-25.

The meaning of the Sutra is that\nthe judge shall not promote litigation, and incite people to institute suits.\nIf litigants do not humbly appear before him, he is not to send for them.\n\n[249:28](sbe0277.htm#fr_1210) See also Narada I, 38, 41.\n\n[249:29](sbe0277.htm#fr_1211) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 12.
