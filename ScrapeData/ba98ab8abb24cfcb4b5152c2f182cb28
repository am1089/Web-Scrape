And on account of its being designated as that to which the Released have\nto resort.\n\nBy the abode of heaven, earth, and so on, we have to understand the highest\nBrahman for that reason also that we find it denoted as that to which the\nReleased have to resort.--The conception that the body and other things\ncontained in the sphere of the Not-self are our Self, constitutes Nescience;\nfrom it there spring desires with regard to whatever promotes the well-being\nof the body and so on, and aversions with regard to whatever tends to injure\nit; there further arise fear and confusion when we observe anything\nthreatening to destroy it. All this constitutes an endless series of the most\nmanifold evils with which we all are acquainted. Regarding those on the other\nhand who have freed themselves from the stains of Nescience desire aversion\nand so on, it is said that they have to resort to that, viz. the abode of\nheaven, earth, &c. which forms the topic of discussion. For the text, after\nhaving said, 'The fetter of the heart is broken, all doubts are solved, all\nhis works perish when He has been beheld who is the higher and the lower' (Mu.\nUp. II, 2, 8), later on remarks, 'The wise man freed from name and form goes\nto the divine Person who is greater than the great' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8). That\nBrahman is that which is to be resorted to by the released, is known from\nother scriptural passages, such as 'When all desires which once entered his\nheart are undone then does the mortal become immortal, then he obtains\nBrahman' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 7). Of the pradhana and similar entities, on the\nother hand, it is not known from any source that they are to be resorted to by\nthe released. Moreover, the text (in the passage, 'Know him alone as the Self\nand leave off other words') declares that the knowledge of the abode of heaven\nand earth, &c. is connected with the leaving off of all speech; a condition\nwhich, according to another scriptural passage, attaches to (the knowledge of)\nBrahman; cp. B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 21, 'Let a wise Brahma _n_ a, after he has\ndiscovered him, practise wisdom. Let him not seek after many words, for that\nis mere weariness of the tongue.'--For that\n\np. 158\n\nreason also the abode of heaven, earth, and so on, is the highest Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 3](sbe34072.htm)\n\n"
