Of these twain plainly tell  \nWhich is the better way?  \nKrishna. To cease from works  \nIs well, and to do works in holiness  \nIs well; and both conduct to bliss supreme;  \nBut of these twain the better way is his  \nWho working piously refraineth not.\n\nThat is the true Renouncer, firm and fixed,  \nWho- seeking nought, rejecting nought- dwells proof  \nAgainst the "opposites." O valiant Prince!  \nIn doing, such breaks lightly from all deed:  \n\'Tis the new scholar talks as they were two,  \nThis Sankhya and this Yoga: wise men know  \nWho husbands one plucks golden fruit of both!  \nThe region of high rest which Sankhyans reach  \nYogins attain. Who sees these twain as one  \nSees with clear eyes! Yet such abstraction, Chief!  \nIs hard to win without much holiness.  \nWhoso is fixed in holiness, self-ruled,  \nPure-hearted, lord of senses and of self,  \nLost in the common life of all which lives-  \nA "Yogayukt"- he is a Saint who wends  \nStraightway to Brahm. Such an one is not touched  \nBy taint of deeds. "Nought of myself I do!"  \nThus will he think- who holds the truth of truths-  \nIn seeing, hearing, touching, smelling; when  \nHe eats, or goes, or breathes; slumbers or talks,  \nHolds fast or loosens, opes his eyes or shuts;  \nAlways assured "This is the sense-world plays  \nWith senses." He that acts in thought of Brahm,  \nDetaching end from act, with act content,  \nThe world of sense can no more stain his soul  \nThan waters mar th\' enamelled lotus-leaf.  \nWith life, with heart, with mind,- nay, with the help  \nOf all five senses- letting selfhood go-  \nYogins toil ever towards their souls\' release.  \nSuch votaries, renouncing fruit of deeds,  \nGain endless peace: the unvowed, the passion-bound,  \nSeeking a fruit from works, are fastened down.  \nThe embodied sage, withdrawn within his soul,  \nAt every act sits godlike in "the town  \nWhich hath nine gateways," neither doing aught  \nNor causing any deed. This world\'s Lord makes  \nNeither the work, nor passion for the work,  \nNor lust for fruit of work; the man\'s own self  \nPushes to these! The Master of this World  \nTakes on himself the good or evil deeds  \nOf no man- dwelling beyond! Mankind errs here  \nBy folly, darkening knowledge. But, for whom  \nThat darkness of the soul is chased by light,  \nSplendid and clear shines manifest the Truth  \nAs if a Sun of Wisdom sprang to shed  \nIts beams of dawn. Him meditating still,  \nHim seeking, with Him blended, stayed on Him,  \nThe souls illuminated take that road  \nWhich hath no turning back- their sins flung off,  \nBy strength of faith. [Who will may have this Light;  \nWho hath it sees.] To him who wisely sees,  \nThe Brahman with his scrolls and sanctities,  \nThe cow, the elephant, the unclean dog,  \nThe Outcast gorging dog\'s meat, are all one.\n\nThe world is overcome- aye! even here!  \nBy such as fix their faith on Unity.  \nThe sinless Brahma dwells in Unity,  \nAnd they in Brahma. Be not over-glad  \nAttaining joy, and be not over-sad  \nEncountering grief, but, stayed on Brahma, still  \nConstant let each abide! The sage whose soul  \nHolds off from outer contacts, in himself  \nFinds bliss; to Brahma joined by piety,  \nHis spirit tastes eternal peace. The joys  \nSpringing from sense-life are but quickening wombs  \nWhich breed sure griefs: those joys begin and end!  \nThe wise mind takes no pleasure, Kunti\'s Son!  \nIn such as those! But if a man shall learn,  \nEven while he lives and bears his body\'s chain,  \nTo master lust and anger, he is blest!  \nHe is the Yukta; he hath happiness,  \nContentment, light, within: his life is merged  \nIn Brahma\'s life; he doth Nirvana touch!  \nThus go the Rishis unto rest, who dwell  \nWith sins effaced, with doubts at end, with hearts  \nGoverned and calm. Glad in all good they live,  \nNigh to the peace of God; and all those live  \nWho pass their days exempt from greed and wrath,  \nSubduing self and senses, knowing the Soul!\n\nThe Saint who shuts outside his placid soul  \nAll touch of sense, letting no contact through;  \nWhose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows,  \nWhose outward breath and inward breath are drawn  \nEqual and slow through nostrils still and close;  \nThat one- with organs, heart, and mind constrained,  \nBent on deliverance, having put away  \nPassion, and fear, and rage;- hath even now,  \nObtained deliverance, ever and ever freed.  \nYea! for he knows Me Who am He that heeds  \nThe sacrifice and worship, God revealed;  \nAnd He who heeds not, being Lord of Worlds,  \nLover of all that lives, God unrevealed,  \nWherein who will shall find surety and shield!\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER V OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Karmasanyasayog,"  \nOr "The Book of Religion by Renouncing  \nFruit of Works."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6: Of Religion of Self-Restraint](bg06.htm)\n\n'
