Pra _g_ apati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is performed here,\nand from which these creatures have been produced: and in like manner are they\nproduced thereafter even to this day.\n\n4:5:5:22\\. After the Upa _m_ _s_ u cup goats are produced. Now that (cup) is\nagain employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and\nagain.\n\n4:5:5:33\\. After the Antaryama cup sheep are produced. Now that (cup) is again\nemployed at the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.\n\np. 407\n\n4:5:5:44\\. And because of those two (cups) which are together he offers the\nUpa _m_ _s_ u first, therefore, of goats and sheep when they are together 1,\nthe goats go first, and the sheep behind them.\n\n4:5:5:55\\. And because, having offered the Upa _m_ _s_ u, he wipes (the\nvessel) upwards, therefore these goats walk like nimbly 2 climbing spokes.\n\n4:5:5:66\\. And because, having offered the Antaryama, he wipes (the vessel)\ndownwards, therefore these sheep walk with their heads down, as if digging.\nNow they, the goats and sheep, are most conspicuously Pra _g_ apati-like:\nwhence, bringing forth thrice in the year, they produce two or three 3 (young\nones).\n\n4:5:5:77\\. After 4 the _S_ ukra cup men are produced. Now that (cup) is again\nemployed at the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.\nBut the _S_ ukra (bright) is the same as he that burns yonder, and he indeed\nis Indra; and of animals, man is Indra-like 5: whence he rules over animals.\n\n4:5:5:88\\. After the _Ri_ tu cup the one-hoofed species is produced. Now that\n(cup) is again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced\nagain and again. And such-like is the Ritu cup 6, and suchlike the head of the\none-hoofed. The \xc3\x82graya _n_ a\n\np. 408\n\ncup, the Ukthya cup, and the \xc3\x82ditya cup,--after them cows are produced. Now,\nthese are again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced\nagain and again.\n\n4:5:5:99\\. And because goats are produced after the fewest cups, therefore,\nthough bringing forth thrice in a year, producing two or three, (they are)\nvery few, for they are produced after the fewest cups.\n\n4:5:5:1010\\. And because cows are produced after the most cups, therefore,\nthough bringing forth once in a year, and producing one each time, (they are)\nmost numerous, for they are produced after the most cups.\n\n4:5:5:1111\\. Then, in the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a (trough) he finally draws the\nHariyo _g_ ana graha. Now, the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a is Pra _g_ apati;--he turns\nunto these creatures, and fosters them, and kisses them 1: he fosters them in\nthat he produces them.\n\n4:5:5:1212\\. Now, these same cups after which creatures are produced, are\nfive,--those of the Upa _m_ _s_ u and Antaryama (counting as) one and the\nsame, the _S_ ukra cup, the _Ri_ tu cup, the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a cup, and the Ukthya\ncup; for there are five seasons in the year, and Pra _g_ apati is the year,\nand the sacrifice is Pra _g_ apati. But if there be six seasons in the year,\nthen the \xc3\x82ditya cup is the sixth of them.\n\n4:5:5:1313\\. But indeed there is only that one cup after which creatures are\nproduced here, to wit, the Upa _m_ _s_ u cup; for the Upa _m_ _s_ u is breath,\nand Pra _g_ apati is breath, and everything here is after Pra _g_ apati.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[407:1](sbe2664.htm#fr_950) That is, in mixed flocks. In the compound 'a _g_\navika' (Ka _n_ v. a _g_ avaya _h_ , \xce\xb1\xe1\xbc\xb6\xce\xb3\xce\xb5\xcf\x82 \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xe1\xbd\x84\xcf\x8a\xce\xb5\xcf\x82) also the goats come first.\n\n[407:2](sbe2664.htm#fr_951) Perhaps 'ara' has to be taken in the sense of\n'quick, nimble,' instead of 'spokes,' and ' _d_ itara' might mean 'flying up,'\n'popping up their heads,' as opposed to 'ava _k_ ina _s_ irshan.'\n\n[407:3](sbe2664.htm#fr_952) ?
