The Pra _n_ ita water, doubtless, is the head of the sacrifice 1;\nand when he leads forward the Pra _n_ ita water, it is the head of the\nsacrifice he thereby forms, and he should know that it is that head of his own\nthat is then being formed.\n\n11:2:6:22\\. The fuel, indeed, is its breath (of the mouth), for it is by the\nbreath that everything here is kindled (animated) that has breath and moves\ntwinkling with its eyelids: let him know that it is he himself that is that\nfuel.\n\n11:2:6:33\\. The kindling-verses, indeed, are its spine: let him therefore say\n(to the Hot _ri_.) regarding them, 'Recite for me, making them, as it were,\ncontinuous 2;' for continuous, as it were, is this spinal column. And the two\nlibations of ghee are its mind and speech, Sarasvat and Sarasvati 3: let\n\np. 36\n\nhim know that the two libations of ghee are his mind and speech, Sarasvat and\nSarasvati.\n\n11:2:6:44\\. The five fore-offerings are these its five (outlets of the) vital\nairs in the head;--the first fore-offering is its mouth, the second the right\nnostril, the third the left nostril, the fourth the right ear, and the fifth\nthe left ear. And inasmuch as at the fourth fore-offering he pours together\n(the ghee 1), therefore this ear is, on the inner side, connected by a channel\n(with the other). The two butter-portions are the eyes: let him know that\nthese are his own eyes.\n\n11:2:6:55\\. And that cake which is offered to Agni is its right flank; and the\nlow-voiced offering is its heart; and inasmuch as they perform this in a low\nvoice, this heart is, as it were, in secret.\n\n11:2:6:66\\. And that cake which is offered to Agni and Soma (at full moon), or\nIndra's Sannayya (at new moon), is its left flank; the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t is\nthat part between its shoulders; and the (Brahman's) fore-portion 2 is the\npoison 3.\n\n11:2:6:77\\. And when he cuts off the fore-portion,---even as there they cut\nout what was injured 4 in Pra _g_ apati, so do they now thereby cut out what\nin this (body) is clogged and hardened, and affected by Varu _n_ a\n\np. 37\n\nlet him know that, as there they cut out what was injured in Pra _g_ apati, so\nthey now cut out what in him is clogged and hardened and affected by Varu _n_\na.\n\n11:2:6:88\\. The I _d_ a, indeed, is the belly: even as there, at (the\ninvocation of) the I _d_ a 1 they cut off portions (and put them) together, so\nnow food, of all kinds is put together in the belly.\n\n11:2:6:99\\. The three after-offerings are these its three downward breathings;\nand the Suktavaka and _S_ amyorvaka its arms (or fore-feet); the four Patnisa\n_m_ ya _g_ as the four supports--the two thighs and the two knee-bones; and\nthe Samish _t_ aya _g_ us is the two (hind) feet.\n\n11:2:6:1010\\. These are twenty-one offerings;--two libations of ghee, five\nfore-offerings, two butter-portions, and Agni's cake: this makes ten; Agni and\nSoma's low-voiced offering, Agni and Soma's cake, the Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_\nt, the I _d_ a, three after-offerings, the Suktavaka, the _S_ amyorvaka,\nfurther his seizing (the two spoons) at the same time there at the Patnisa _m_\nya _g_ as 2 and (last) the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us.\n\n11:2:6:1111\\. These are twenty-one offerings,--there are twelve months and\nfive seasons in a year; and three worlds--that makes twenty; and yonder\nburning (sun) is the twenty-first--that is the goal 3, that the resting-place:\nhe thus reaches that goal, that resting-place.\n\n11:2:6:1212\\. Now, as to this \xc3\x82ru _n_ i said, 'Every half-month, indeed, I\nbecome a sharer of the same world with yonder sun: that is the perfection of\nthe Full and New-moon sacrifices which I know.'\n\np. 38\n\n11:2:6:1313\\. As to this they ask, 'Who is the better one, the self-offerer,\nor the god-offerer?' Let him say, 'The self-offerer;' for a self-offerer,\ndoubtless, is he who knows, 'This my (new) body is formed by that (body of Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, the sacrifice), this my (new) body is procured 1 thereby.' And even\nas a snake frees itself from its skin, so does he free himself from his mortal\nbody, from sin; and made up of the _Ri_ _k_ , the Ya _g_ us, the Saman, and of\nofferings, does he pass on to the heavenly world.\n\n11:2:6:1414\\. And a god-offerer, doubtless, is he who knows, 'I am now\noffering sacrifice to the gods, I am serving the gods,'--such a one is like an\ninferior who brings tribute to his superior, or like a man of the people who\nbrings tribute to the king: verily, he does not win such a place (in heaven)\nas the other.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[35:1](sbe44016.htm#fr_151) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, the sacrifice, is here, as so often,\nto be understood as the abstract representation of the victim (here the\nhorse), as well as of the Purusha,--i.e. Pra _g_ apati, and the Sacrificer.\n\n[35:2](sbe44016.htm#fr_152) The kindling-verses, being in the Gayatri metre,\nconsist of three octosyllabic padas each. Whilst after each verse a kindling-\nstick (samidh) is thrown into the fire by the Adhvaryu, the Hot _ri_ does not\nmake any pause in his recitation at this point, but he does so after the\nsecond pada of each verse, thus connecting the last pada with the first two\npadas of the next verse.\n\n[35:3](sbe44016.htm#fr_153) See XI, 2, 5, 9 (There doesn't appear to be such a\nparagraph--JBH).\n\n[36:1](sbe44016.htm#fr_154) See I, 5, 3, 16.\n\n[36:2](sbe44016.htm#fr_155) See I, 7, 4, 10 seqq.\n\n[36:3](sbe44016.htm#fr_156) Instead of 'visham,' the MS. of Saya _n_ a's\ncommentary reads 'dvishan' (hater, enemy), which is explained as meaning ' _s_\natrubuddhi'; the cutting out' of the fore-portion being compared with the\nannihilation of enemies ( _s_ atrunirasanartham),--all this is, however,\nmanifestly fanciful. What is intended would seem to be the poison (real or\nfigurative) caused by the enemies' (or Rudra's, or Varu _n_ a's) shafts, in\naccordance with the myth regarding Pra _g_ apati and his daughter, I, 7, 4, 1\nseqq.\n\n[36:4](sbe44016.htm#fr_157) Literally, what was pierced (by an arrow), cf. I,\n7, 4, 3. 9.\n\n[37:1](sbe44016.htm#fr_158) See I, 8, 1, 12 seqq.\n\n[37:2](sbe44016.htm#fr_159) See I, 9, 2, 19.\n\n[37:3](sbe44016.htm#fr_160) Saisha suryarupaiva gati _h_ gantavyabhumi _h_ ;\neshaiva pratish _th_ a k _ri_ tsnaphalasya _s_ raya _h_ , Say.\n\n[38:1](sbe44016.htm#fr_161) Upadhiyate upasthapyate, Say.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 2, 7.
