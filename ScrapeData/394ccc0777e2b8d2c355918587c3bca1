Thou, O Agni, (who art) the first A\xe1\xb9\x85giras _Ri_ shi, hast become as god the\nkind friend of the gods. After thy law the sages, active in their wisdom\n[1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:1:1), were born, the Maruts with brilliant spears.\n\n2\\. Thou, O Agni, the first, highest A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, a sage, administerest the law of\nthe gods, mighty for the whole world, wise, the son of the two mothers\n[1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:2:1), reposing everywhere for (the use of) the living\n[2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:2:2).\n\n3\\. Thou, O Agni, as the first, shalt become [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:3:1)\nmanifest to Matari _s_ van, through thy high wisdom, to Vivasvat. The two\nworlds trembled at (thy) election as Hot _ri_. Thou hast sustained the\nburthen; thou, O Vasu, hast sacrificed to the great (gods)\n[2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:3:2).\n\n4\\. Thou, O Agni, hast caused the sky to roar [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:4:1)\nfor Manu, for the well-doing Pururavas, being thyself a greater well-doer.\nWhen thou art loosened by power (?) [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:4:2) from thy\nparents, they led thee hither before and afterwards again.\n\n5\\. Thou, O Agni, the bull, the augmenter of prosperity, art to be praised by\nthe sacrificer who raises the spoon, who knows all about the offering\n[1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:5:1) and (the sacrifice performed with) the word\nVasha _t_. Thou (god) of unique vigour art the first to invite\n[2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:5:2) the clans.\n\n6\\. Thou, O Agni, leadest forward the man who follows crooked ways\n[1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:6:1), in thy company at the sacrifice\n[2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:6:2), O god dwelling among all tribes, who in the\nstrife of heroes, in the decisive moment for the\n\np. 23\n\nobtainment of the prize [3](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:6:3), even with few\ncompanions killest many foes in the battle [4](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:6:4).\n\n7\\. Thou, O Agni, keepest that mortal [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:7:1) in the\nhighest immortality, in glory day by day, (thou) who being thirsty thyself\n[2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:7:2) givest happiness to both races (gods and men),\nand joy to the rich.\n\n8\\. Thou, O Agni, praised by us, help the glorious singer to gain prizes. May\nwe accomplish our work with the help of the young active (Agni). O Heaven and\nEarth! Bless us together with the gods.\n\n9\\. Thou, O Agni, in the lap of thy parents, a god among gods, O blameless\none, always watchful, be the body's creator and guardian to the singer. Thou,\nO beautiful one, pourest forth all wealth.\n\n10\\. Thou, O Agni, art our guardian, thou art our father. Thou art the giver\nof strength; we are thy kinsmen. Hundredfold, thousandfold treasures come\ntogether in thee, who art rich in heroes, the guardian of the law, O\nundeceivable one.\n\n11\\. Thee, O Agni, the gods have made for the living as the first living\n[1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:11:1), the clan-lord of the Nahusha\n[2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:11:2). They have made (the goddess) I _l_ a the\nteacher of men (manusha), when a son of my father is born\n[3](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:11:3).\n\n12\\. Thou, O Agni, protect with thy guardians, O god, our liberal givers and\nourselves, O venerable one! Thou art the protector of kith and kin\n[1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:12:1) and of the cows, unremittingly watching over\nthy law.\n\n13 [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:13:1). Thou, O Agni, art kindled four-eyed, as the\nclosest guardian for the sacrificer who is without (even) a quiver\n[2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:13:2). Thou acceptest in thy mind the hymn even of\nthe poor [3](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:13:3) who has made offerings\n[4](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:13:4), that he may prosper without danger.\n\n14\\. Thou, O Agni, gainest [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:14:1) for the widely-\nrenowned\n\np. 24\n\nworshipper that property which is desirable and excellent. Thou art called the\nguardian and father even of the weak [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:14:2); thou\ninstructest the simple, thou, the greatest sage, the quarters of the world\n[3](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:14:3).\n\n15\\. Thou, O Agni, protectest on every side like well-stitched armour the man\nwho gives sacrificial fees. He who puts sweet food (before the priests), who\nmakes them comfortable in his dwelling, who kills living (victims), he (will\nreside) high in heaven [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:15:1).\n\n16\\. Forgive, O Agni, this our fault (?) [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:16:1), (look\ngraciously at) this way which we have wandered from afar. Thou art the\ncompanion, the guardian, the father of those who offer Soma; thou art the\nquick one [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:16:2) who makes the mortals _Ri_ shis\n[3](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:16:3).\n\n17\\. As thou didst for Manus, O Agni, for A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, O A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, for Yayati on\nthy (priestly) seat, as for the ancients, O brilliant one, come hither,\nconduct hither the host of the gods, seat them on the sacrificial grass, and\nsacrifice to the beloved (host).\n\n18\\. Be magnified, O Agni, through this spell which we have made for thee with\nour skill or with our knowledge. And lead us forward to better things. Let us\nbe united with thy favour, which bestows strength.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi of the hymn is Hira _n_ yastupa \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa. To him tradition\nascribes the authorship of the collection I, 31-35, probably because in X,\n149, 5 the poet invokes Savit _ri_ , 'as Hira _n_ yastupa the \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa has\ncalled thee, O Savit _ri_.' Vedic theologians of course tried to find out\nwhere this invocation of Hira _n_ yastupa to Savit _ri_ was preserved, and the\nhymn, I, 35, seemed to agree best with the conditions\n\np. 25\n\nof the case (comp. Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Ges. XLII, 230). By this and many\nsimilar cases it is made probable that at the time when the Anukrama _n_ i was\ncomposed, all real knowledge as to authors to whom the collections of the\nfirst Ma _n_ _d_ ala belong, was lost.\n\nThe metre is _G_ agati; only the verses 8, 16, 18 are Trish _t_ ubh. Verse 1 =\nVS. 34, 12. Verse 8 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 12 = VS. 34, 13. With verse 16\ncomp. AV. III, 15, 4.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Vidmana\xc2\xb4pasa _h_ seems to be nom. plur., not gen. sing. Comp. I, 111,\n1. takshan ratham \xe2\x80\xa6 vidmana\xc2\xb4pasa _h_ , 'they (the _Ri_ bhus), active in their\nwisdom, have wrought the chariot.'\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. As to dvi _m_ ata\xc2\xb4 _s_ ayu _h_ , comp. III, 55, 6 ( _s_ ayu _h_\nparastat adha nu dvimata\xc2\xb4); Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 50.--On Agni's two\nmothers and his double birth see Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, II, 52.\n\nNote 2. By 'living' I have translated ayu. See on this word, Bergaigne, Rel.\nVed., I, 59 seq.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Probably Bergaigne (Rel. Ved. I, 55, note 2) is right in conjecturing\nbhava _h_ for bhava. In this case we should have to translate: 'Thou as the\nfirst hast become manifest to Matari _s_ van.'\n\nNote 2. I believe that to maha _h_ we have to supply deva\xc2\xb4n; see II, 37, 6;\nIII, 7, 9; VI, 16, 2; 48, 4, &c. 'Can it not be an adverb? See vol. xxxii, p.\n307; Lanman, p. 501,' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Comp. V, 58, 6. let Dyu (sky) roar down, the bull of the dawn. V, 59.\n8. may Dyaus Aditi (the unbounded) roar for our feast.\n\np. 26\n\nNote 2. The translation of _s_ vatra is purely conjectural. It rests on the\nsupposition that the word is related to _s_ u _s_ uve, _s_ avas, &c. (thus\nGrassmann). Boehtlingk-Roth connect it with svad, which is phonetically\nimpossible; they give the meaning 'schmackhaft,' and paraphrase our passage:\ndas mit einer Lockspeise (z. B. mit einem Spahn) von den Reibholzern\nabgenommene Feuer kann man hin and her tragen. Ludwig: mit Geprassel. I do not\nsee how this translation would fit for a number of the passages in which the\nword occurs.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. With the third Pada compare VI, 1, 9. ya _h_ a\xc2\xb4hutim pari veda namobhi\n_h_.\n\nNote 2. Avivasasi cannot belong to the relative clause. The accent must be\nchanged accordingly.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. It is very curious to find here Agni as the protector of the v _ri_\n_g_ inavartani, the man who follows crooked ways. Ludwig tries to explain the\npassage by understanding the vidatha, in which Agni is here said to protect\nthe sinner, as an asylum, but we have no reason to believe that the word could\nhave this meaning. See the next note.\n\nNote 2. On the derivation and meaning of vidatha various opinions have been\npronounced in the last years, which have been collected by Prof. Max Muller in\nhis note on V, 59, 2 (vol. xxxii p. 349 seq.; see also Bartholomae, Studien\nzur indogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, I, 41). Without trying to discuss here\nall different theories, I immediately proceed to state my own opinion, though\nI am far from claiming certainty for it. It will, however, I believe, solve\nthe difficulties tolerably well. I propose to derive vidatha from vi-dha; the\ndh was changed into d by the same 'Hauchdissimilationsgesetz' (Brugmann,\nGrundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik, vol. i, p. 355 seq.), according to\nwhich Arian *bhaudhati was changed into Sanskrit\n\np. 27\n\nbodhati. No one will doubt that the operation of this\n'Hauchdissimilationsgesetz' could be annihilated by opposite forces, but it\nmust be admitted that the forms with 'Hauchdissimilation' could also remain\nintact. The verb vi-dha means 'to distribute, to arrange, to ordain;' thus the\noriginal meaning of vidatha must be, like the meaning of vidha\xc2\xb4na,\n'distribution, disposition, ordinance.' In V, 3, 6 we read vidatheshu ahnam:\nthis phrase receives its explanation by VII, 66, 11. vi ye dadhu _h_ _s_\naradam ma\xc2\xb4sam a\xc2\xb4t aha _h_ ; ahoratra\xc2\xb4 _n_ i vidadhat, X, 190, 2; masa\xc2\xb4m\nvidha\xc2\xb4nam, X, 1.38, 6; _ri_ tu\xc2\xb4n \xe2\x80\xa6 vi dadhau, I, 95, 3. We may call attention\nalso to VI, 51, 2. veda ya _h_ tri\xc2\xb4 _n_ i vidathani esham deva\xc2\xb4nam _g_ anma,\n'he who knows their threefold division, the birth of the gods;' VI, 8, 1. pra\nnu vo _k_ am vidatha _g_ atavedasa _h_ , 'I will proclaim the ordinances of\n_G_ atavedas.' Within the sphere of the Vedic poets' thoughts, the most\nprominent example of something most artificially 'vihita' was the sacrifice\n(comp. vi ye dadhu _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am, VII, 66, 11; _s_ a _m_ sati uktham ya\n_g_ ate vi u dha _h_ , IV, 6, 11; [the moon] bhagam devebhya _h_ vi dadhati\na-yan, X, 85, 19; and the following very significant passage: ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya\ntva vidatha p _ri_ _k_ _kh_ am atra kati hotara _h_ _ri_ tu _s_ a _h_ ya _g_\nanti, Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XXIII, 57). Thus ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a and vidatha, 'sacrifice'\nand 'ordinance,' became nearly synonymous (comp. III, 3, 3, &c.). It would be\nsuperfluous to quote the whole number of passages which show this, but I\nbelieve that an attentive reader will discern at least in some of them the\ntraces of the original meaning of vidatha; see, for instance, II, 1, 4; III,\n28, 4.--Finally vidatha seems to mean 'the act of disposing of any business'\nor the like; this meaning appears, I believe, in passages like the well-known\nphrase, b _ri_ hat vadema vidathe suvi\xc2\xb4ra _h_ (comp. suvi\xc2\xb4rasa _h_ vidatham a\xc2\xb4\nvadema): 'may we with valiant men mightily raise our voice at the determining\n(of ordinances, &c.).' Thus the words vidatha and sabha\xc2\xb4 approach each other\nin their meaning; a person influential in council is called both vidathy\xcc\x83a and\nsabheya (see Boehtlingk-Roth, s. v. vidathy\xcc\x83a).\n\nNote 3. The exact meaning of paritakmya is not quite\n\np. 28\n\nfree from doubt. Comp. Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XV, 203, note 1.\n\nNote 4. Prof. Max Muller translates this verse: 'Thou savest the man who has\ngone the wrong way in the thick of the battle, thou who art quick at the\nsacrifice; thou who in the strife of heroes, when the prize (or the booty) is\nsurrounded (beset on all sides), killest,' &c.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The phrase begins as if a relative clause were to follow attached to\nthe words 'that mortal.' But, instead of this, afterwards a relative clause\nfollows referring to 'thou, O Agni.'\n\nNote 2. Roth (Ueber gewisse Kurzungen des Wortendes, p. 4) and Bartholomae\n(Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXIX, 559) think that a dative (like tat _ri_ sha _n_\na\xc2\xb4ya) is required; Agni gives comfort to both thirsty races, gods and men.\nRoth takes tat _ri_ sha _n_ a[ _h_ ] for an abbreviation of tat _ri_ sha _n_\na\xc2\xb4ya; Bartholomae conjectures tat _ri_ sha\xc2\xb4ya. It would be more easy to change\nthe form into a dative with the ending -a (= -ai); comp. Kluge, Kuhn's\nZeitschrift, XXV, 309 Pischel-Geldner, I, 61; Aufrecht, Festgruss an\nBohtlingk, I; J. Schmidt, Pluralbildungen, 234. But why not leave the\nnominative? Agni, being thirsty himself, quenches the thirst of other beings.\nComp. J. Schmidt, Pluralbildungen, 309.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x82yum ayave. See verse 2, note 2.\n\nNote 2. The names Nahus, Nahusha have much the same value as Manus, Manusha.\nBut it seems that not all the Aryan tribes, but only a certain part of them,\nwere considered as descendants of Nahus. Comp. Bergaigne, Rel. Vedique, II,\n324.\n\nNote 3. The last words are very obscure. Mamaka occurs only in one other\npassage, belonging to the same collection of hymns, I, 34, 6: there the A _s_\nvins are invoked to bestow blessings on 'my son' (mamakaya sunave). 'When a\nson of my father is born' may mean 'When I am\n\np. 29\n\nborn,' or 'When a new issue is born within our tribe:' then--thus we may\npossibly supply--the goddess I _l_ a, the teacher of mankind, will be the new-\nborn child's teacher also. Another possible explanation would be to take\nMamaka as a proper name. Or Prof. Max Muller may be right, who writes: 'Could\nnot pitu _h_ yat putra _h_ mamakasya _g_ a\xc2\xb4yate refer to Agni, who, in III,\n29, 3, was called i _l_ aya _h_ putra _h_. Her father and husband (Manu) is\nalso the father of mankind, therefore of the poet who says: Whenever the son\nof my father is born, they made I _l_ a (his mother) the teacher of man.'\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. Trata\xc2\xb4 tokasya tanaye seems to be nothing else but trata\xc2\xb4 tokasya\ntanayasya, which would have had one syllable too much.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. Comp. on this verse, Pischel, I, 216 seq.\n\nNote 2. Agni is to protect the man who has no quiver, and cannot, therefore,\nprotect himself. The four eyes of the divine guardian seem to signify that he\ncan look in all directions, and perhaps also that he has the power of seeing\ninvisible bad demons. The watchdogs of Yama also are four-eyed, X, 14, 10. 11;\ncomp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 474, note 4. Comp. nisha\xe1\xb9\x85gin, Rig-veda III,\n30, 15; V, 57, 2; X, 103, 3.\n\nNote 3. On kiri, comp. Pischel loc. cit.\n\nNote 4. Ratahavya _h_ means either a man who has made offerings, or a god to\nwhom offerings are made. That it stands here in the first sense is shown with\ngreat probability by VIII, 103, 13, where the kiri _h_ ratahavya _h_ svadhvara\n_h_ is described, the man who, though poor, makes offerings and is a good\nsacrificer. But if we are right in our translation of ratahavya _h_ , the verb\nvanoshi cannot belong to the relative clause; I propose to read vanoshi\nwithout accent. The way in which Pischel tries to explain the accent of\nvanoshi, by taking the words kire _h_ _k_ it mantram manasa as a parenthesis,\nis too artificial.\n\np. 30\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. I think that we should here, as in verse 13, read vanoshi without\naccent.\n\nNote 2. This must be at least the approximate meaning of adhra. 'For adhrasya\none expects radhrasya,' M. M.\n\nNote 3. I think that the quarters of the world have nothing to do here, but\nthat instead of pra di _s_ a _h_ we should read (with Ludwig) pradi _s_ a _h_.\nA similar mistake regarding the word pradi _s_ occurs several times in the\ntext of the Rig-veda. I propose to translate the corrected text: 'Thou\ninstructest the simple, well knowing the (divine) commandments.' Comp.\nvayunani vidva\xc2\xb4n, duty\xcc\x83ani vidva\xc2\xb4n, &c.\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. 'Der ist des himels ebenbild' (Ludwig). But this word upama\xc2\xb4 is, as\nfar as we can see, not very ancient. I take upama\xc2\xb4, with Boehtlingk-Roth, as\nan adverbial instrumental like dakshi _n_ a\xc2\xb4, madhya\xc2\xb4, &c. Prof. Max Muller\ntranslates 'close or near to heaven.'\n\n##### Verse 16.\n\nNote 1. _S_ ara _n_ i designates in the Atharva-veda VI, 43, 3 a fault or\ndefect, the exact nature of which cannot be determined. Boehtlingk-Roth\npropose Widerspanstigkeit, Hartnackigkeit; Max Muller. Abweg, Fehltritt.\n\nNote 2. On bh _ri_ mi, comp. M. M.'s note on II, 34, 1.\n\nNote 3. Comp. III, 43, 5. kuvit ma _r i_shim papiva\xc2\xb4 _m_ sam sutasya (supply\nkarase), 'Wilt thou make me a _Ri_ shi after I have drunk Soma?'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 36](sbe46009.htm)\n\n"
