Now by means of the sacrifice the gods ascended to heaven. But the\ngod who rules over\n\np. 200\n\nthe cattle was left behind here: hence they call him Vastavya, for he was then\nleft behind on the (sacrificial) site 1 (vastu).\n\n1:7:3:22\\. The gods went on worshipping and toiling with the same (sacrifice)\nby which they had ascended to heaven. Now the god who rules over the cattle,\nand who was left behind here,--\n\n1:7:3:33\\. He saw (what occurred, and said), \'I have been left behind: they\nare excluding me from the sacrifice!\' He went up after them, and with his\nraised (weapon) 2 rose up on the north--the time (when this happened) was that\nof the (performance of the) Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n1:7:3:44\\. The gods said, \'Do not hurl!\' He said, \'Do not ye exclude me from\nthe sacrifice! Set apart an oblation for me!\' They replied, \'So be it!\' He\nwithdrew (his weapon), and did not hurl it; nor did he injure any one.\n\n1:7:3:55\\. The gods said (to one another), \'Whatever portions of sacrificial\nfood have been taken out by us, they have all been offered up. Try to discover\n\np. 201\n\nsome means by which we may set apart an oblation for him!\'\n\n1:7:3:66\\. They said to the Adhvaryu priest, \'Sprinkle the sacrificial dishes\n(with butter) in proper succession; and replenish them for the sake of one\n(additional) portion, and again render them fit for use; and then cut off one\nportion for each!\'\n\n1:7:3:77\\. The Adhvaryu accordingly sprinkled the sacrificial dishes in proper\nsuccession, and replenished them for the sake of one (additional) portion, and\nagain rendered them fit for use, and cut off one portion for each. This then\nis the reason why he (Rudra) is called Vastavya 1, for a remainder (vastu) is\nthat part of the sacrifice which (is left) after the oblations have been made:\nhence, if sacrificial food is offered to any deity, the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t\n(Agni, \'the maker of good offering\') is afterwards invariably offered a share\nof it; because the gods invariably gave him a share after themselves.\n\n1:7:3:88\\. That (offering) then is certainly made to \'Agni,\' for, indeed, Agni\nis that god;--his are these names: _S_ arva, as the eastern people call him;\nBhava, as the Bahikas (call him); Pa _s_ unam pati (\'lord of beasts,\' Pa _s_\nupati), Rudra, Agni 2. The name Agni, doubtless, is the most auspicious\n\np. 202\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _s_ anta), and the other names of his are\ninauspicious: hence it is offered to (him under the name of) \'Agni,\' and to\n(him as) the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n1:7:3:99\\. They (the gods) said, \'What we have offered unto thee who art in\nyonder place 1, do thou render that well-offered (svish _t_ a) for us!\' He\nmade it well-offered for them; and this is the reason why (it is offered) to\n(Agni as) the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n1:7:3:1010\\. Having recited the invitatory formula 2, he (the Hot _ri_ )\nenumerates (those deities) which (have received oblations at the fore-\nofferings, butter-portions, &c.), as well as Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t:--\'May\nAgni offer Agni\'s favourite dainties!\' thereby he refers to Agni\'s butter-\nportion 3. \'May he offer Soma\'s favourite dainties!\' thereby he refers to\nSoma\'s butter-portion.--\'May he offer Agni\'s favourite dainties!\' thereby he\nrefers to that indispensable cake for Agni which is (offered) on both\noccasions (at the new- and full-moon sacrifices).\n\n1:7:3:1111\\. And so with the several deities. \'May he offer the favourite\ndainties of butter-drinking gods!\' thereby he refers to the fore-offerings\n(praya _g_ a) and after-offerings (anuya _g_ a), for, assuredly, the butter-\ndrinking gods (represent) the fore-offerings and after-offerings.--\'May he\noffer Agni the Hot _ri_ \'s\n\np. 203\n\nfavourite dainties!\' thereby he refers to Agni as Hot _ri_ ; for after the\ngods had set apart this oblation for him, they still further propitiated him\nby this (formula), and invited him to his favourite dainty 1: this is the\nreason why he thus enumerates.\n\n1:7:3:1212\\. Here now some make (the name of) the deity precede the \'may he\noffer (aya _t_ )!\' thus--\'Of Agni may he offer (the favourite dainties)!\' \'Of\nSoma may he offer!\' But let him not do this; for those who make the deity\nprecede the \'may he offer!\' violate the proper order at the sacrifice, since\nit is by pronouncing the \'may he offer,\' that he pronounces what comes first\nhere: let him therefore place the \'may he offer\' first.\n\n1:7:3:1313\\. [The Hot _ri_ continues to recite]: \'May he sacrifice to his own\ngreatness!\' When, on that occasion 2, he asks him (Agni) to bring hither the\ndeities, he also makes him bring hither his own greatness; but before this no\nworship of any kind has been offered to \'his (Agni\'s) own greatness:\' and he\ntherefore now gratifies him, and thus that (fire) has been established so as\nto prevent failure on his (the sacrificer\'s) part. This is the reason why he\nsays \'may he sacrifice to his own greatness.\'\n\n1:7:3:1414\\. \'By sacrifice may he obtain for himself food worthy of sacrifice\n3!\' the food, doubtless, is these creatures: he thereby makes them eager to\nsacrifice, and these creatures go on sacrificing, worshipping and performing\nausterities.\n\np. 204\n\n1:7:3:1515\\. \'May he, the knower of beings, (perform) 1 the sacred cult; may\nhe graciously accept the sacrificial food!\' Thereby he prays for success to\nthis sacrifice; for when the gods graciously accept the sacrificial food, then\nhe (the sacrificer) gains great things 2: for this reason he says \'may he\ngraciously accept the sacrificial food!\'\n\n1:7:3:1616\\. The reason why on this occasion the invitatory and offering-\nformulas are made closely to correspond to each other (avak _li_ ptatama), is\nthat the svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (is equivalent to) the evening libation, and the\nevening libation, doubtless, belongs to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ (the \'All-gods\n) 3. \'Gladden thou the longing gods, O youngest!\' this much in the invitatory\nformula refers to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_  4. \'O Agni, Hot _ri_ of the cult!\nwhen this day (thou comest) to the men 5;\' this much in the offering-formula\nrefers to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_. And because such is the form of these two\n(formulas), therefore they are of\n\np. 205\n\nthe form of the evening libation; and this is why the invitatory and offering-\nformulas on this occasion are made closely to correspond to each other.\n\n1:7:3:1717\\. They are both trish _t_ ubh verses; for the svish _t_ ak _ri_ t\nis, as it were, the residue (or site, vastu) of the sacrifice, and the residue\n(or, a vacant site) is without energy 1. Now the trish _t_ ubh means manly\npower 2, energy: hence he thereby imparts manly power, energy to that residue,\nthe svish _t_ ak _ri_ t. This is why they are both trish _t_ ubh verses.\n\n1:7:3:1818\\. Or they are both anush _t_ ubh verses. The anush _t_ ubh is\nresidue (or site, vastu), and the svish _t_ ak _ri_ t also is residue: hence\nhe thereby puts a residue to a residue 3. And, verily, one who knows this, and\nwhose (invitatory and offering-formulas) are two anush _t_ ubh verses, his\nhomestead (vastu) is prosperous, and he himself prospers in regard to progeny\nand cattle.\n\np. 206\n\n1:7:3:1919\\. Now here Bhallabeya 1 made the invitatory formula (consist of) an\nanush _t_ ubh verse, and the offering-formula of a trish _t_ ubh verse,\nthinking, \'I thus obtain (the benefits of) both.\' He fell from the cart, and\nin falling, broke his arm. He reflected: \'This has befallen because of\nsomething or other I have done.\' He then bethought himself of this: \'(It has\nbefallen) because of some violation, on my part, of the proper course of the\nsacrifice.\' Hence one must not violate the proper course (of sacrificial\nperformance); but let both (formulas) be verses of the same metre, either both\nanush _t_ ubh verses, or both trish _t_ ubh verses.\n\n1:7:3:2020\\. He cuts (the portions for Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t) from the\nnorth part (of the sacrificial dishes) 2, and offers them up on the north part\n(of the fire): for this is the region of that god, and therefore he cuts from\nthe north part and offers on the north part. From that side, indeed, he arose\n3, and there they (the gods) appeased him: for this reason he cuts from the\nnorth part, and offers on the north part.\n\n1:7:3:2121\\. He offers on this side (in front), as it were, of the other\noblations. Following the other oblations cattle are produced, and the Svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t represents Rudra\'s power: he would impose Rudra\'s power on\n\np. 207\n\nthe cattle if he were to bring it (the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t) into contact with\nthe other oblations; and his (the sacrificer\'s) household and cattle would be\ndestroyed. For this reason he offers on this side, as it were, of the other\noblations.\n\n1:7:3:2222\\. That (fire)---to wit, the \xc3\x82havaniya--is, indeed, that sacrifice\nby which the gods then ascended to heaven; and that (other fire) which was\nleft behind here, is the Garhapatya: hence they take out the former from the\nGarhapatya, (so as to be) before (east) of it.\n\n1:7:3:2323\\. He may lay it (the \xc3\x82havaniya) down at the distance of eight steps\n(from the Garhapatya); for of eight syllables, doubtless, consists the gayatri\nhence he thereby ascends to heaven by means of the gayatri.\n\n1:7:3:2424\\. Or he may lay it down at the distance of eleven steps 1; for of\neleven syllables, indeed, consists the trish _t_ ubh: hence he thereby ascends\nto heaven by means of the trish _t_ ubh.\n\n1:7:3:2525\\. Or he may lay it down at the distance of twelve steps; for of\ntwelve syllables, indeed, consists the _g_ aga: hence he thereby ascends to\nheaven by means of the _g_ agati. Here, however, there is no (fixed) measure:\nlet him, therefore, lay it down where in his own mind he may think proper 2.\nIf he takes it ever so little east (of the Garhapatya), he ascends to heaven\nby it.\n\n1:7:3:2626\\. Here now they say, \'Let them cook the sacrificial\n\np. 208\n\ndishes on the \xc3\x82havaniya; for thence, assuredly, the gods ascended to heaven,\nand therewith they went on worshipping and toiling: therein we will cook the\nsacrificial dishes; therein we will perform the sacrifice! For, as it were, a\ndisplacement 1 of the sacrificial dishes would take place, if they were to\ncook them on the Garhapatya. The \xc3\x82havaniya is the sacrifice: we will perform\nthe sacrifice in the sacrifice!\'\n\n1:7:3:2727\\. However, they also do cook on the Garhapatya, arguing, \'The\nformer is indeed ahavaniya (i.e. "suitable for a burnt-offering"); but that\none, surely, is not (intended) for this,--viz. that they should cook uncooked\n(food) on it; but it is (intended) for this,--viz. that they should offer up\ncooked (food) on it.\' He may therefore do it on whichever (fire) he pleases.\n\n1:7:3:2828\\. That sacrifice spake, \'I dread nakedness.\' \'What is unnakedness\nfor thee?\' \'Let them strew (sacrificial grass) all round me!\' For this reason\nthey strew (sacrificial grass) all round the fire. \'I dread thirst.\' \'How art\nthou to be satiated?\' \'May I satiate myself after the priest has been\nsatisfied!\' Let him therefore, on the completion of the sacrifice, order that\nthe priest be satisfied; for then he satisfies the sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[200:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_459) Or perhaps, he was left behind with, or in, the\nremains (of the sacrifice);\' vastu being evidently also taken in this sense by\nour author, in par. 7.\n\n[200:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_460) The text has ayataya merely, which, to become\nintelligible, clearly requires some noun, which may have been lost here. Saya\n_n_ a is silent on this point. In Dr. Muir\'s version of the legend, Original\nSanskrit Texts, IV, p. 202, the word is left untranslated. I am inclined to\nsupply some such noun as heti, \'weapon;\' cf. XII, 7, 3, 20, where this very\nword is used in connection with Rudra: in later times it is also specially\napplied to Agni\'s weapon or flame ( _g_ ihva, \'tongue\'). It is not impossible,\nhowever, that we have to supply tanva (\'with his raised body, or self\'). To ma\nvi srakshi _h_ (for which the Ka _n_ va recension reads ma \'stha _h_ ), \'do\nnot hurl,\' and to sa _m_ vivarha (\'he drew back\'), Saya _n_ a supplies ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ am, \'sacrifice:\' hence he apparently takes it thus,--\'do not scatter (the\nsacrifice),\'--\'he kept (the sacrifice) together and did not injure it in any\nway.\'\n\n[201:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_461) On the identification of Agni with Rudra, see also\nVI, 1, 3, 7; and Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 339 seq.\n\n[201:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_462) Passages such as this and VI, 1, 3, 7 seq. are of\nconsiderable interest, as showing, on the one hand, the tendency towards\nidentifying and blending originally distinct and apparently local Vedic gods,\nespecially Rudra, with the person of Agni, the representative of the divine\npower on earth in the later Vedic triad; and, on the other hand, the origin of\nthe conception of Siva, in the pantheistic system of the post-Vedic period. On\nour passage, see also Weber, Ind. Stud. II, p. 37; I, p. 189; Muir, Original\nSanskrit Texts, IV, p. 328.\n\n[202:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_463) That is, according to Saya _n_ a, on the \xc3\x82havaniya\nfire-place.\n\n[202:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_464) The anuvakya for the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t is Rig-\nveda X, 2, 1: piprihi devan\xcc\x90 u _s_ ato yavish _th_ a (\'gladden thou the\nlonging gods, O youngest!\') &c. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. I, 6, 2.\n\n[202:3](sbe1232.htm#fr_465) See I, 4, 2, 16-17. These formulas (nigada) of\nenumeration (aya _d_ agnir agne _h_ priya dhamani, &c.--yakshad agner hotu _h_\npriya dhamani, &c.) form part of the offering-formula. The ya _g_ ya proper,\nhowever, which they precede is Rig-veda VI, 15, 14, agne yad adya vi _s_ o\nadhvarasya hota _h_ [\'O Agni, Hot _ri_ of the cult! when this day (thou\ncomest) to the men \'], &c.\n\n[203:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_466) Or, resort, abode, dhaman.\n\n[203:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_467) Viz. at the \'devatanam avahanam,\' cf. I, 4, 2, 17;\n[p. 118](sbe1218.htm#page_118), n. [1](sbe1218.htm#fn_307).\n\n[203:3](sbe1232.htm#fr_468) \'\xc3\x82ya _g_ atam e _g_ ya isha _h_.\' Mahidhara, on Va\n_g_. S. XXI, 47, interprets it thus: \'May these (isha _h_ ) desirous\n(creatures), fit for sacrifice, sacrifice properly!\' Similarly perhaps Saya\n_n_ a on our passage.\n\n[204:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_469) Here k _ri_ _n_ otu is omitted in the text, but\ncf. Va _g_. S. XXI, 47; Taitt. Br. III, 5, 7, 6; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. I, 6, 5. Dr.\nHillebrandt, Altind. Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 11 [construes](errata.htm#6)\nit with the preceding formula: \'er mache darbringungswerth die Speisen; er,\nder Wesenkenner, nehme beim Opfer das havis an.\' (?)\n\n[204:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_470) Mahat, \'grosses.\'\n\n[204:3](sbe1232.htm#fr_471) See Va _g_. S. XIX, 26. Here the author, as usual\n(cf. p. 5 note), attempts to enhance the solemnity of the ceremony by\nidentifying it with the t _ri_ tiya-savana, or evening libation at the Soma-\nsacrifice, both offerings constituting the final ceremonies in the main\nperformance of the respective sacrifices. We shall, however, see (cf. I, 8, 3,\n25) that as at the evening libation the remains of the Soma are offered up, so\nalso are the remains of havis offered to the vi _s_ ve deva _h_ at the\nconclusion of the present sacrifice. At IV, 4, 5, 17 it is more especially the\noffering of rice-cake to Agni and Varu _n_ a, at the evening libation, which\nis identified with the svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n[204:4](sbe1232.htm#fr_472) See p. 202, note 2.\n\n[204:5](sbe1232.htm#fr_473) See p. 202, note 3.\n\n[205:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_474) Aviryam; cf. II, 1, 2, 9, where the ( _s_ arira)\nempty body (of Pra _g_ apati) is called a vastu aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iyam aviryam. See\nalso above, I, 7, 3, 7, where we met with vastu in the sense of \'remainder,\nthat which remains,\' as Saya _n_ a also seems to take it here.\n\n[205:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_475) Indriyam, literally \'Indra\'s power.\' The trish _t_\nubh often (e _g_. Rig-veda X, 130, 5) appears specially related to Indra; and\nthe hymns addressed to him are almost entirely in this metre. Taitt. S. VII,\n1, 1, 4 it is said to have been created by Pra _g_ apati from his own chest\nand arms, immediately after Indra, and together with the B _ri_ hat-saman, the\nRa _g_ anya, and the ram; and that these are therefore viryavant, having been\ncreated out of virya (i.e. the seats of \'manly power\').\n\n[205:3](sbe1232.htm#fr_476) For this symbolical explanation see Taitt. S. VII,\n1, 1, 5, where the anush _t_ ubh is said to have been created by Pra _g_\napati, by his fourth and last creative act, from his feet, together with the\nVaira _g_ a-saman, the _S_ udra, and the horse; the two last named being,\ntherefore, styled \'bhuta-sa\xe1\xb9\x85kramin (? subservient to creatures).\' I do not\nfind it stated anywhere, what anush _t_ ubh verses may optionally be taken for\nthe anuvakya and ya _g_ ya of the svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n[206:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_477) That is, Indradyumna Bhallabeya, as the Ka _n_ va\nrecension reads here and II, 1, 4, 6. Cf. X, 6, 1, 1.\n\n[206:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_478) He makes, as usual, an under-layer (upastara _n_\na) of butter in the _g_ uhu; cuts a piece from the north part of each of the\ntwo cakes (or of the one cake and of both the sweet and the sour milk\nconstituting the sannayya); and thereupon bastes the pieces twice (not once)\nwith butter.\n\n[206:3](sbe1232.htm#fr_479) See above, par. 3. The same quarter is assigned to\nRudra, IX, 1, 1, 10. See also Weber, Ind. Stud, I, p. 225.\n\n[207:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_480) The Baudhay. _S_ ulvas. (66) lays it down as the\nrule that the Brahma _n_ a has to construct his \xc3\x82havaniya fire at the distance\nof eight prakramas (step of two padas or feet each) to the east of the\nGarhapatya, the Ra _g_ anya at the distance of eleven, and the Vai _s_ ya at\nthe distance of twelve, steps. Thibaut, Pandit X, p. 22.\n\n[207:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_481) See 1, 2, 5, 14.\n\n[208:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_482) Apaskhala. Saya _n_ a takes skhala to mean\nwinnowing- (or threshing-) floor (? khala): hence apaskhala would mean \'the\nleaping (of the husk, &c.) out of the winnowing-floor.\' The Ka _n_ va MS.\nreads, \'apaskhala iva sa havisha _m_ yad garhapatya _h_ \' (? \'the Garhapatya\nis to the sacrificial food the outside of a winnowing-floor, as it were.\')\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 7, 4.
