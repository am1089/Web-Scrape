But only good and evil works, thus Badari thinks.\n\nAs the verb a- _k_ ar takes karman for its object (pu _n_ ya _m_ karma _k_\narati, &c.), and as the separate denotation (i.e. the use of apparently\nequivalent words, viz. a _k_ ar and karman) can be accounted for on the ground\nthat one of them refers to works established by manifest texts, and the other\nto texts inferred from actually existing rules of good conduct; and as, when\nthe primary meaning is possible, no secondary meaning must be adopted; nothing\nelse but good and evil works (in the Vedic sense) are denoted by the word _k_\nara _n_ a: such is the opinion of the teacher Badari. This opinion of Badari,\nthe author of the Sutra states as representing his own. On the other hand, he\nadopts the view of Karsh _n_ a _g_ ini in so far as he considers such items of\nvirtuous _conduct_ as the Sandhya\\--which are enjoined by scriptural texts,\nthe existence of which is inferred on the basis of conduct as enjoined by Sm\n_ri_ ti--to have the result of qualifying the agent for the performance of\nother works.--The conclusion therefore is that the souls descend, carrying a\nremnant of their works.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the passing of\nworks.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 12.
