And (the devas, &c. are not qualified) on account of (the words denoting\nthe devas, &c.) being (used) in the sense of (sphere of) light.\n\nTo that sphere of light, the purvapakshin resumes, which is stationed in the\nsky, and during its diurnal revolutions illumines the world, terms such as\n\xc3\x82ditya, i.e. the names of devas, are applied, as we know from the use of\nordinary language, and from Vedic complementary passages 1. But of a mere\nsphere of light we cannot understand how it should be endowed with either a\nbodily form, consisting of the heart and the like, or intelligence, or the\ncapability of forming wishes 2. For mere light we know to be, like earth,\nentirely devoid of intelligence. The same observation applies to Agni (fire),\nand so on. It will perhaps be said that our objection is not valid, because\nthe personality of the devas is known from the mantras, arthavadas, itihasas,\npura _n_ as, and from the conceptions of ordinary life 3; but we contest the\nrelevancy of this remark. For the conceptions of ordinary life do not\nconstitute an independent means of knowledge; we rather say that a thing is\nknown from ordinary life if it is known by the (acknowledged) means of\nknowledge, perception, &c. But none of the recognised means of knowledge, such\nas perception and the like, apply to the\n\np. 218\n\nmatter under discussion. Itihasas and pura _n_ as again being of human origin,\nstand themselves in need of other means of knowledge on which to base. The\narthavada passages also, which, as forming syntactical wholes with the\ninjunctory passages, have merely the purpose of glorifying (what is enjoined\nin the latter), cannot be considered to constitute by themselves reasons for\nthe existence of the personality, &c. of the devas. The mantras again, which,\non the ground of direct enunciation, &c., are to be employed (at the different\nstages of the sacrificial action), have merely the purpose of denoting things\nconnected with the sacrificial performance, and do not constitute an\nindependent means of authoritative knowledge for anything 1.--For these\nreasons the devas, and similar beings, are not qualified for the knowledge of\nBrahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[217:1](sbe34101.htm#fr_211) As, for instance, 'So long as \xc3\x82ditya rises in the\neast and sets in the west' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 6, 4).\n\n[217:2](sbe34101.htm#fr_212) Whence it follows that the devas are not personal\nbeings, and therefore not qualified for the knowledge of Brahman.\n\n[217:3](sbe34101.htm#fr_213) Yama, for instance, being ordinarily represented\nas a person with a staff in his hand, Varu _n_ a with a noose, Indra with a\nthunderbolt, &c. &c.\n\n[218:1](sbe34101.htm#fr_214) On the proper function of arthavada and mantra\naccording to the Mima _m_ sa, cp.
