This is the support on which the rubbing (for\nproducing the fire) is performed [2](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:1:2); the creative\norgan [3](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:1:3) has been prepared. Bring hither the house-\nwife [4](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:1:4); let us produce Agni by rubbing in the old\nway.\n\n2\\. In the two fire-sticks dwells _G_ atavedas, as the germ (lies) safe in\npregnant women--Agni who should be magnified [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:2:1) day\nby day by wakeful men who bring offerings.\n\n3\\. Place it [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:3:1) skilfully into her who lies\nextended [2](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:3:2). Having conceived she has quickly given\nbirth to the manly one. He whose summit is red--bright is his splendour--the\nson of I _l_ a has been born in the (due) way [3](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:3:3).\n\n4\\. In the place of I _l_ a, on the navel of the earth we will lay thee down,\n_G_ atavedas, that thou, O Agni, mayst carry the offerings (to the gods).\n\n5\\. Rub, ye men, the truthful sage, the wise, the immortal, the fair-faced.\nBring forth, ye men, Agni, the banner of sacrifice, the first in the front,\nthe gracious one.\n\n6\\. When they produce him by rubbing with their arms, he shines forth _l_\naming in the wood like a red race-horse. Like the bright one on the path of\nthe A _s_ vins [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:6:1) the unrestrained (Agni) spares\nthe stones, burning the grass [2](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:6:2).\n\n7\\. Agni, when born, shines forth resplendent, the racer, the priest, praised\nby the sages, the giver of rain, whom the gods placed in the sacrifices, to be\n\np. 303\n\nmagnified, as the omniscient carrier of the sacrificial offerings.\n\n8\\. Sit down, O Hot _ri_ , in the space which is thine, as the knowing one.\nPlace the sacrifice in the abode of good works (i. e. on the altar). Eagerly\nlonging for the gods thou shalt worship the gods by offerings. Agni, bestow\nmighty vigour on the sacrificer.\n\n9\\. Produce a mighty [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:9:1) smoke, ye friends. Without\nfail go forward towards strength. This Agni is the conqueror in battles, rich\nin valiant men, he by whom the gods have overpowered the Dasyus.\n\n10\\. This is thy birth-place in due time whence born thou shonest forth;\nknowing it, O Agni, sit down on it, and make our prayers prosper.\n\n11\\. He is called Tanunapat as the Asura's germ. Nara _s_ a _m_ sa he becomes\nwhen he is born, Matari _s_ van when he has been shaped in the mother\n[1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:11:1). And he has become the rush of the wind in his\nswift course [2](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:11:2),\n\n12\\. Rubbed forth by skilful rubbing, established by skilful establishing, as\na sage, O Agni, perform excellent sacrifices. Sacrifice to the gods for him\nwho is devoted to the gods [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:12:1).\n\n13\\. The mortals have generated the immortal one, the \xe2\x80\xa6\n[1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:13:1), advancing one with strong jaws. The ten\nunwedded sisters [2](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:13:2) united take care of the man\n(Agni) when he has been born.\n\n14\\. He the god of the seven Hot _ri_ s shone forth from of old, when he\nflamed up in his mother's lap, at her udder. Day by day the joyous one never\ncloses his eyes, when he has been born from the Asura's (i. e. of the\nHeaven's?) belly [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:14:1).\n\n15\\. The onsets of (Agni) when he attacks his enemies, are like those of the\nMaruts. (He is) the\n\np. 304\n\nfirst-born (son) of the sacred spell. They know every (fire)\n[1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:15:1). The Ku _s_ ikas have raised their brilliant\nspell; they have kindled Agni, every one in his house.\n\n16\\. After we had chosen thee here to-day, O wise Hot _ri_ , while this\nsacrifice was going on, thou hast firmly sacrificed and firmly laboured. Come\nto this Soma, expert and knowing!\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The prevalent metre is Trish _t_ ubh.--Verses 1, 4, 10, 12\nare Anush _t_ ubh; verses 6, 11, 14, 15, _G_ agati.\n\nThe Sukta, which belongs to the later additions (see the note on hymn 28),\nconsists of a number of verses and small groups of verses referring to the\nproduction of fire by the attrition of the two fire-sticks. The order in which\nthe verses stand does not always agree with the natural order of the ritual\nacts.--Verse 2 = SV. I, 79. Verse 3 = VS. XXXIV, 14. Verse 4 = VS. XXXIV, 15;\nTS. III, 5, 11, 1; MS. I, 6, 2. 7; IV, 10, 4; 11, 1. Verse 8 = VS. XI, 35; TS.\nIII, 5, 11, 2; IV, 1, 3, 3; MS. II, 7, 3; IV, 10, 4. Verse 10 = VS. III, 14;\nXII, 52; XV, 56; TS. I, 5, 5, 2; IV, 2, 4, 3; 7, 13, 5; TB. I, 2, 1, 16; II,\n5, 8, 8; MS. I, 5, 1; 6, 1; AV. III, 20, 1. Verse 13 = TB. I, 2, 1, 19. Verse\n16 = VS. VIII, 20; TS. I, 4, 44, 2; MS. I, 3, 38; AV. VII, 97, 1.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The verses 1-3 a, b have been translated by Muir, Original Sanskrit\nTexts, V, p. 209.\n\nNote 2. On the adhimanthana _s_ akala, the piece of wood on which the lower\nfire-stick is laid, see _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a\n\np. 305\n\n[paragraph continues] III, 4, 1, 20. so\xe0\xa4\xbddhimanthana _m_ _s_ akalam adatte\nagner _g_ anitram asity atra hy agnir _g_ ayate. Schwab, Das Altindische\nThieropfer, p. 78 seq.\n\nNote 3. Pra _g_ anana seems to be used in the concrete sense as the male\norgan. As such, the poet may have considered the so-called pramantha in the\ngeneration of Agni, which is described as having the shape of the male organ\n(Schwab, loc. cit., 78; see also Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl.\nGesellschaft, XLIII, 591). It does not seem very probable that the darbhapi\n_\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ula of which Saya _n_ a thinks should be meant.\n\nNote 4. Saya _n_ a explains this as meaning the Ara _n_ i (fire-stick), i. e.\nthe lower Ara _n_ i, the receptacle of the upper fire-stick. In the Taittiriya\nBrahma _n_ a I, 2, 1, 13 the two Ara _n_ is are addressed as mahi vi _s_\npatni.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The text has i\xc2\xb4 _d_ ya _h_.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The upper fire-stick or, more accurately, the pramantha.\n\nNote 2. Comp. above, II, 10, 3. The lower Ara _n_ i is alluded to, which is\nconsidered as a wife and more particularly as the nymph Urva _s_ i (Katyayana\nV, 1, 30, &c.).\n\nNote 3. Prof. Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 301) takes the genitive i _l_ aya\n_h_ as dependent on vayune: 'wurde der Sohn geboren am Orte (Wege) der\nOpferspende.' To me it seems unnatural not to connect i _l_ aya _h_ with putra\n_h_ , which words are connected also by the Sandhi (the Sa _m_ hita text has i\n_l_ ayas putro, not i _l_ aya _h_ putro).\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. For ya\xc2\xb4man, cf. I, 37, 3; III, 2, 14 VI, 15, 5. Should not the bright\none on the path of the A _s_ vins be the sun? Saya _n_ a thinks of the chariot\nof the A _s_ vins, which also may be right.\n\np. 306\n\nNote 2. Are the stones and the grass identical with the stones and grass-\nblades occurring in the later ritual of the agnyadheya and agnimanthana ( _S_\natapatha Br. II, 1, 1, 8; III, 4, 1, 21; Katyayana IV, 8, 16, &c.)?\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Literally, a manly, strong, or bull-like smoke.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. This is a play upon words (Matari _s_ va and amimita matari, 'he has\nbeen shaped in the mother').\n\nNote 2. Von Bradke (Dyaus Asura, p. 51): des Windes Heerde (?) wird er, wenn\ner dahingleitet.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. This Pada is identical with I, 15, 12. It is a galita.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. The meaning of asreman (comp. X, 8, 2. asrema\xc2\xb4 vatsa _h_ [i. e. Agni]\n_s_ imivan aravit) is unknown.\n\nNote 2. The ten fingers.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. Comp. von Bradke, loc. cit., 50.\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. Or prathama _g_ a\xc2\xb4m brahmana _h_ vi _s_ ve it vidu _h_ : 'all (people)\nknow him the first-born (son) of the sacred spell'? Comp. I, 34, 2. somasya\nvena\xc2\xb4m anu vi _s_ ve it vidu _h_.--Prof. Max Muller writes: 'Prathama _g_ a\n_h_ is the wind, X, 168, 3. It might here refer to the Maruts, who are often\nsaid to sing prayers; they know all about Brahman (prayer).'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1](sbe46090.htm)\n\n"
