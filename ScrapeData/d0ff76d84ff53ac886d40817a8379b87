Naraya _n_ a said :-- Brahma, then putting S\xc2\x92iva to the task of killing\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a went to His own abode. The other Devas returned to their\nhomes. Here under the beautiful Ba _t_ a tree, on the banks of the river\nChandrabhaga, Mahadeva pitched His big tent and encamped Himself to get the\nvictory of the Devas. He then sent Chitraratha, the Lord of the Gandharbhas,\nas a messenger to S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, the Lord of the Danavas. By the command of\nMahadeva, Chitraratha went to the city of the king of Daityas, more beautiful\nthan Indra\xc2\x92s place and more wealthy than the mansion of Kuvera. The city was\nfive yojanas wide and twice as much in length. It was built of crystals of\npearls and jewels. There were roadways on all sides. There were seven\ntrenches, hard to be crossed, one after another, encircling the city. The city\nwas built of countless rubies and gems, brilliant like flames. There were\nhundreds of roadways and markets and stalls, in the wonderful Vedis (raised\nplatforms) built of jewels. All around were splendid palatial buildings of\ntraders and merchantmen, filled with various articles. There were hundreds and\nko _t_ is of beautiful buildings, adorned with various ornaments and built of\nvariegated red stones looking like Sinduras. Thus he went on and saw, in the\nmiddle, the building of S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, circular like the lunar sphere. Four\nditches all filled with fiery flames, encircled one after another, his house.\nSo the enemies could not in any way cross them; but the friend could easily go\nthere. On the top were seen turrets built of jewels, rising high to the\nheavens. The gate-keepers were watching the twelve gates. In the centre were\nsituated lakhs and lakhs of excellent jewel built houses. In every room there\nwere jewelled steps and staircases and the pillars were all built of gems and\njewels, and pearls. Pu _s_ padanta (Chitraratha) saw all this and then went to\nthe first gate and saw one terrible person, copper coloured, with tawny eyes,\nsitting with a trident in his hand and with a smiling countenance. He told he\nhad come as a messenger and got his entrance. Thus Chitraratha went one afer\nanother to all the entries, not being prohibited at all though he told that he\nhad come as a messenger on war service. The Gandharbha reached one after\nanother, the last door and said :-- \xc2\x93O Door keeper! Go quickly and inform the\nLord of the Danavas all about the impending war.\xc2\x94 When the messenger had\nspoken thus, the gate-keeper allowed him to go inside. Going inside, the\nGandarbha saw S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, of excellent form, seated in the middle of the\nroyal assembly, on a golden\n\n\n\np. 884\n\n\n\nthrone. One servant was holding on the king\xc2\x92s head an umbrella, decked with\ndivine excellent gems, the inner rod of the umbrella being made up of jewels,\nand decorated with expanded artificial flowers made of gems. The attendants\nwere fanning him with beautiful white chamaras; he was nicely dressed,\nbeautiful and lovely and adorned with jewel ornaments. He was nicely\ngarlanded, and wore fine celestial garments. Three Ko _t_ i Danavas were\nsurrounding him; and seven Ko _t_ i Danavas, all armed, were walking to and\nfro.\n\n\n\n22-53. Pu _s_ padanta was thunderstruck when he saw thus the Danava and he\naddressed him thus :-- O King! I am a servant of S\xc2\x92iva; My name is Pu _s_\npadanta; hear what S\xc2\x92iva has commanded me to tell you. You better now give\nback, to the Devas, the rights that they had before. The Devas went to S\xc2\x92ri\nHari and had taken His refuge. S\xc2\x92ri Hari gave over to S\xc2\x92iva one S\xc2\x92ula weapon\nand asked the Devas to depart. At present, the three eyed Deva is residing\nunder the shade of a Ba _t_ a tree on the banks of the Pu _s_ pabhadra river.\nHe told me to speak this to you, \xc2\x93Either give over to the Devas their rights,\nor fight with me. Please reply and I will speak to Him accordingly.\xc2\x94\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, hearing the messenger\xc2\x92s words laughed and said, \xc2\x93Tomorrow\nmorning I will start, ready for war. Better go away today.\xc2\x94 The messenger went\nback to S\xc2\x92iva and replied to Him accordingly. In the meantime the following\npersonages joined S\xc2\x92iva and remained seated on excellent aerial cars, built of\njewels and gems. The following were the persons :-- Skanda, Virabhadra, Nandi,\nMahakala, Subhadraka, Vis\xc2\x92alak _s_ a, Ba _n_ a, Pingalak _s_ a, Vikampana,\nVirupa, Vikriti, Ma _n_ ibhadra, Vaskala, Kapilak _s_ a, Dirgha Da _n_ g _st_\nra, Vika _t_ a, Tamralochana, Kalaka _nt_ ha, Balibhadra, Kalajihba, Ku _t_\nichara, Balonmatta, Ra _n_ as\xc2\x92laghi, Durjaya, Durgama, (these eight\nBhairavas), eleven Rudras, eight Vasus, Indra, the twelve \xc3\x82dityas, fire, moon,\nVis\xc2\x92vakarma, the two As\xc2\x92vins, Kuvera, Yama, Jayanta, Nala Kubara, Vayu, Varu\n_n_ a, Budha, Mangala, Dharma, S\xc2\x92ani, Is\xc2\x92ana, the powerful Kamadeva. Ugradam\n_st_ ra, Ugracha _n_ da, Ko _t_ ara, Kai _t_ abhi, and the eight armed\nterrible Devi Bhadrakali. Kali wore the bloody red clothings and She smeared\nred sandal paste all over Her body.\n\n\n\nDancing, laughing; singing songs in tune, very jolly, She bids Her devotees\ndiscard all fear, and terrifies the enemies. Her lip is terrible, lolling, and\nextends to one Yojana. On Her eight arms She holds conch, disc, mace, lotus,\naxe, skin, bow and arrows. She was holding in Her hands, the bowl shaped human\nskull; that was very deep and one Yojana wide. Her trident reached up to the\nHeavens; Her weapon called S\xc2\x92akti (dart) extended to one Yojana. Besides there\nwere Mudgara\n\n\n\np. 885\n\n\n\n(mace), Musala (club), Vajra (thunderbolt), Kheta (club), brilliant Phalaka\n(shield), the Vai _sn_ ava weapon, the Varu _n_ a weapon, the \xc3\x82gneyastra (the\nfire weapon), Nagapas\xc2\x92a (the noose of serpents), the Naraya _n_ astra, the\nGandharva\xc2\x92s weapons, the Brahma\xc2\x92s weapons, the Ga _d_ u _d_ astram, the\nParjanayastram, the Pas\xc2\x92upatastram, the Jrimbha\xc3\xb1astram, the Parvatastram, the\nMahes\xc2\x92varastram, the Vayavyastram, and the Sanmohanam rod and various other\ninfallible divine weapons. Besides hundreds of other divine weapons were with\nHer. Three Ko _t_ is of Yoginis and three Ko _t_ is and a half of terrible\nDakinis were attending Bhadrakali. Bhutas, (demons) Pretas, Pis\xc2\x92achas, Kusma\n_n_ das, Brahma Rak _s_ asas, Rakh _s_ asas, Vetalas, Yak _s_ as and Kinnaras\nalso were there in countless numbers. At this time Kartikeya came there and\nbowed down to his father Mahadeva. He asked him to take his seat on His left\nside an asked him to help. Then the army remained there in military array. On\nthe other hand, when S\xc2\x92iva\xc2\x92s messenger departed, S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a went to the\nzenana and informed Tulasi of the news of an impending war. No sooner She\nheard than her throat and lips and palate became dried. She then with a\nsorrowful heart spoke in sweet words :-- \xc2\x93O my Lord! O my Friend! O the Ruler\nof My life! Wait for a moment and take your seat on My heart. Instil life in\nMe for a moment. Satisfy My desire of human birth. Let me behold you fully so\nthat my eyes be satisfled. My breath is now very agitated. I saw by the end of\nthe night one bad dream. Therefore I feel an internal burning.\xc2\x94 Thus at the\nwords of Tulasi, the king S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a finished his meals and began to\naddress her, in good and true words, beneficent to her :-- \xc2\x93O My Lady! It is\nKala (the time that brings out these various combinations by which the Karmic\nfruit is enjoyed; it is Kala that awards auspicious and inauspicious things;\nthe Kala is the Sole Master to impart pain, fear, and good and bad things.\n\n\n\n54-84. Trees grow up in time; their branches, etc., come out in time; flowers\nappear in time and fruits come out in time. Fruits are ripen in time and after\ngiving the fruits, they die out also in time. O Fair One! The universe comes\ninto existence in time and dies away in time. The Creator, Preserver, and\nDestroyer of the universe, are creating, preserving and destroying the worlds\nwith the help of time. Time guides them in every way. But the Highest Prakriti\nis the God of Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahes\xc2\x92a (i.e., the Creatrix of Time).\nThis Highest Prakriti, the Highest God is creating, preserving and destroying\nthis universe. She makes the Time dance. By Her mere Will, She has converted\nHer inseparable Prakriti into Maya and is thus creating all things, moving and\nunmoving. She is the Ruler of all; the Form of all, and She is the Highest\nGod. By Her is being done this creation of\n\n\n\np. 886\n\n\n\npersons by persons, this preservation of persons by persons, and this\ndestruction of persons by persons. So you better now take refuge of the\nHighest Lord. Know it is by Her command the wind is blowing, by Her command\nthe Sun is giving heat in due time, by Her command Indra is showering rains;\nby Her command, Death is striding over the beings; by Her command fire is\nburning all things and by Her command the cooling Moon is revolving. She is\nthe Death of death, the Time of time, Yama of yama (the God of death), the\nFire of fire and the Destroyer of the destroyer. So take Her refuge. You\ncannot find and fix who is whose friend in the world; so pray to Her, the\nHighest God, Who is the Friend of All. Oh! Who am I? And who are you either?\nThe Creator is the combiner of us two and so He will dissociate us two by our\nKarma. When difficulty arises, the ignorant fools become overwhelmed with\nsorrow; but the intelligent Pundits do not get at all deluded or become\ndistressed. By the Wheel of Time, the beings are led sometimes into happiness;\nsometimes into pain. You will certainly get Naraya _n_ a for your husband; for\nwhich you practised Tapas before, in the hermitage of Vadari (the source of\nthe Ganges, the feet of Vi _sn_ u). I pleased Brahma by my Tapasya and have,\nby his boon, got you as my wife. But the object for which you did your\nTapasya, that you may get Hari as your husband; will certainly be fulfilled.\nYou will get Gobinda in Vrindabana and in the region of Goloka. I will also go\nthere when I forsake this, my Demon body. Now I am talking with you here;\nafterwards we will meet again in the region of Goloka. By the curse of\nRadhika, I have come to this Bharata, hard to be attained. You, too, will quit\nthis body and, assuming the divine form will go to S\xc2\x92ri Hari. So, O Beloved!\nYou need not be sorry.\xc2\x94 O Muni! Thus these conversations took them the whole\nday and led them to the evening time. The king of the demons, S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a\nthen slept with Tulasi on a nicely decorated bed, strewn with flowers, and\nsmeared with sandal paste, in the Ratna Mandir (temple built of jewels.) This\njewel temple was adorned with various wealth and riches. The jewel lamps were\nlighted. S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a passed the night with his wife in various sports.\nThe thin bellied Tulasi was weeping with a very sorrowful heart, without\nhaving taken any food. The king, who knew the reality of existence, took her\nto his breast and appeased her in various ways. What religious instructions he\nhad received in Bhan _d_ ira forest from S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, those Tattvas,\ncapable to destroy all sorrows and delusions, he now spoke carefully to\nTulasi. Then Tulasi\xc2\x92s joy knew no bounds. She then began to consider,\neverything as transient and began to play with a gladdened heart. Both became\ndrowned in the ocean of bliss; and the bodies of both of them were filled with\njoy\n\n\n\np. 887\n\n\n\nand the hairs stood on their ends. Both of them, then, desirous to have\namorous sports, joined themselves and became like Ardhanaris\xc2\x92vara and so one\nbody. As Tulasi considered S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, to be her lord, so the Danava\nKing considered Tulasi the darling of his life. They became senseless with\npleasureable feelings arising out of their amorous intercourses. Next moment\nthey regained their tenaciousness and both began to converse on amorous\nmatters. Thus both spent their time sometimes in sweet conversations,\nsometimes laughing and joking, sometimes maddened with amorous sentiments. As\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a was clever in amorous affairs, so Tulasi was very expert. So\nnone felt satiated with love affairs and no one was defeated by the other.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twentieth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the war preparations of\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a with the Devas in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 21](bk09ch21.htm)\n\n'
