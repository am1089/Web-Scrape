(That assumption) is justified; on account of the perception of things\nwhich are marks of that; as in ordinary experience.\n\np. 650\n\nThe assumption of all the works perishing at the time of 'departure' involves\nno contradiction; since we perceive, in the sacred texts, matters which are\nmarks of connexion with a body even on the part of the soul which has divested\nitself of all its works and become manifest in its true nature. Compare\n'Having approached the highest light he manifests himself in his true form';\n'He moves about there laughing, playing, and rejoicing'; 'He becomes a self-\nruler, he moves about in all worlds according to his will'; 'He becomes one,\nhe becomes three,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 3; VII, 25, 2; 26, 2). All these\ntexts refer to the soul's connexion with a body. The soul therefore, joined to\nthe subtle body, may proceed on the path of the gods, even after all its works\nhave passed away. But how can the subtle body persist, when the works which\noriginate it have passed away? Through the power of knowledge, we reply.\nKnowledge does not indeed by itself originate the subtle body, but it\npossesses the power of making that body persist, even after the gross body--\nwhich is the instrument for the experience of all ordinary pains and pleasures\n--and all works have passed away, so as thereby to make the soul capable of\nmoving on the path of the gods, and thus to obtain Brahman which is the fruit\nof knowledge. 'As in ordinary life.' As in ordinary life, a tank, which may\nhave been made with a view to the irrigation of rice-fields and the like, is\nmaintained and used for the purpose of drawing drinking-water, and so on, even\nafter the intentions which originally led to its being made have passed away.\n--Here an objection is raised. It may be admitted, that at the time when a man\npossessing true knowledge dies, all his works pass away without a remainder,\nand that the subtle body only remains, enabling him to move towards Brahman;\nbut it cannot be held that the soul in that state does not experience pain and\npleasure; for we know from sacred tradition that Vasish _th_ a, Avantara-\ntamas, and others, who had reached intuition of the highest truth, entered\nafter death on other embodiments, and experienced pain and pleasure due to the\nbirth of sons, various calamities, and so on.--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 31.
