But on (the two roads) of knowledge and works, those two being under\ndiscussion.\n\nIn that place of the knowledge of the five fires, where the answer is expected\nto the question, 'Do you know why that world never becomes full?' the text\nruns as follows: 'On neither of these two ways are those small creatures\ncontinually returning, of whom it may be said, Live and die. Theirs is a third\nplace. Therefore that world never becomes full.'\n\np. 124\n\n[paragraph continues] By the two ways mentioned in this passage we have to\nunderstand knowledge and works.--Why?--On account of their being the subjects\nunder discussion. That means: knowledge and works are under discussion as the\nmeans for entering on the road of the gods and the road of the fathers. The\nclause, 'those who know this,' proclaims knowledge to be the means whereby to\nobtain the road of the gods; the clause, 'sacrifices, works of public utility,\nand alms,' proclaims works to be that by which we obtain the road of the\nfathers. Under the heading of these two paths there stands the subsequent\npassage, 'on neither of these two ways, &c.' To explain. Those who are neither\nentitled, through knowledge, to follow the road of the gods, nor, by works, to\nfollow the road of the fathers, for those there is a third path on which they\nrepeatedly return to the existence of small animals. For this reason also\nthose who do not perform sacrifices. &c. do not reach the moon.--But why\nshould they not first mount to the sphere of the moon and thence descending\nenter on the existence of small animals?--No, that would imply entire\npurposelessness of their mounting. Moreover, if all men when dying would reach\nthe sphere of the moon, that world would be filled by the departed, and from\nthat would result an answer contrary to the question (viz. 'why does not that\nworld become full?'). For an answer is expected showing that that world does\nnot become full.--Nor can we admit the explanation that the other world\npossibly does not become full because re-descent is admitted; since this is\nnot stated by scripture. For it is true, indeed, that the not becoming full\nmight be explained from their re-descending; but scripture actually explains\nit from the existence of a third place, 'Theirs is a third place; therefore\nthat world never becomes full.' Hence the fact of the other world not becoming\nfull must be explained from their not-ascending only. For, otherwise, the\ndescent equally taking place in the case of those who do perform sacrifices,\n&c., it would follow that the statement of a third place is devoid of purpose.\n--The word 'but' (in the Sutra) is meant to preclude the idea--arising from\nthe passage of another _s_ akha (i.e. the Kaush. Up.)\n\np. 125\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--that all departed go to the moon. Under the\ncircumstances the word 'all' which occurs in that passage has to be when as\nreferring only to those qualified, so that the sense is 'all those who depart\nfrom this world properly qualified go to the moon.'--The next Sutra is\ndirected against the averment that all must go to the moon for the purpose\nobtaining a new body, in accordance with the definite statement of number ('in\nthe fifth oblation &c.').\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 18](sbe38094.htm)\n\n"
