Nand. infers from an anonymous Sm _ri_ ti passage, that\nthe first part of this Sutra refers not only to _S_ udras, but to women also,\nand not only to the drinking of Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agavya, {footnote p. 176}but also to\nthe offering of burnt-oblations and the muttering of prayers.]\n\np. 176\n\n8\\. If a man has not connection with his wife in the natural season, unless it\nbe on the days of the full and new moon, or because she is ill, he must fast\nfor three days.\n\n9\\.

He who has (unawares) voided excrements without water (being near), must\nbathe in his clothes, pronounce the \'great words[1],\' and offer a burnt-\noblation[2].\n\n11\\. One who has been surprised asleep by the sun rising or setting, must\nbathe in his clothes and mutter the Gayatri one hundred -and eight times.\n\n12\\. He who has been bitten by a dog, a jackal, a tame pig, an ass, an ape, a\ncrow, or a public prostitute, shall approach a river and (standing in it,\nshall) stop his breath sixteen times.\n\n13\\. One who forgets the Vedic texts which he has studied, or who forsakes the\nsacred fires, must subsist upon alms for a year, bathing at the tree Savanas\n(morning, noon, and evening, sleeping upon the ground, and eating one meal a\nday.\n\n14\\. For setting one\'s self up by false statements, and for falsely accusing\nor abusing a Guru, he must subsist upon milk for a month.\n\n15\\.

See XXXVII, 1, 3.]\n\np. 177\n\ndwell outside the village (Bahyas)[1] an ungrateful man, one who buys or sells\nwith false weights, and one who deprives Brahma _n_ as of their livelihood (by\nrobbing them of a grant made to them by the king or private persons, or by\nother bad practices), all those persons[2] must subsist upon alms for a year.\n\n16\\. An unmarried elder brother whose younger brother is married, a younger\nbrother married before the elder, an unmarried elder sister whose younger\nsister is married, the relative who gives such a damsel in marriage, and the\npriest who officiates at such a marriage, must perform the _K_ andraya _n_ a.\n\n17, He who sells living beings, land, religious merit (obtained by a sacrifice\nor otherwise), or Soma, must perform the Taptak _rikkh_ ra.\n\n18\\.

He who sells dyed cloth, tin[1], precious\n\n[15. 1 \'Or nastikav _ri_ tti means "one who receives his substance from an\natheist."\' See also Gaut. XV, 16.--2 \'The use of the particle _k_ a implies\nthat calumniators are also intended.\' (Nand.)\n\n17\\. See XLVI, 11.\n\n18\\. 1 The term ardra, which Nand. interprets by ardrakam, might also be\nconnected with the following word, and both together be translated by \'fresh\nplants.\' See Y. III, 38.\n\n20\\. 1 Tin, perfumes, and, of the articles enumerated in Sutra 21, {footnote\np. 178} lac, and milk have already been mentioned in Sutras 18 and 19. Nand.\ntries to remove the difficulty in the second case, by stating the perfumes\nmentioned here to be perfumes of a different kind, and in the fourth case, by\nasserting that the milk of female buffalos, &c. is meant in Sutra 2 1. But he\ninterprets the two other terms as given above. Probably the passage is\ninterpolated.]\n\np. 178\n\nstones, perfumes, sugar, honey, liquids or condiments (other than sugar, salt,\nand the like), or wool, must fast for three days.\n\n21\\. He who sells meat, salt, lac, or milk, must perform the _K_ andraya _n_\na.\n\n22\\. And[1] all those persons (mentioned in Sutras 17-21) must be initiated a\nsecond time.\n\n23\\. He who has been riding (voluntarily) upon a camel[1], or upon an ass, and\nhe who has (purposely) bathed, or slept, or eaten, quite naked, must stop his\nbreath three times.\n\n24\\. By muttering attentively the Gayatri three thousand times, (by dwelling)\nupon the pasture of cows, (and) by subsisting on milk for a month, he becomes\nfree from the sin of accepting unlawful presents.\n\n25\\. He who has (knowingly) offered a sacrifice for an unworthy person (such\nas a low-caste person, or an outcast), he who has performed the funeral rites\nfor a stranger, he who has practised magic rites (in order to destroy an\nenemy), and he who has performed a sacrifice of the kind called Ahina[1], (all\nthose persons) may rid themselves of their\n\n[22. 1 Nand. infers from the use of the particle _k_ a that this rule applies\nequally to the persons mentioned in the next Sutra.\n\n23\\. 1 \'The use of the particle va, "or," implies that riding upon a cow, and\nother such animals, is also intended here.\' (Nand.)\n\n25\\. 1 This kind of sacrifice is defined by Nand. as one connected with\nrepeated drinking of the Soma juice, and lasting from two to twelve days.\nMedhatithi (on Manu XI, 198) simply defines {footnote p. 179} it as a\nsacrifice extending over two days or more; Kulluka (ibid.) states that it\nlasts three days or more, and that it is said in the Veda to cause impurity.\nSee also Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 355.]\n\np. 179\n\nsins by performing three K _rikkh_ ra (Pra _g_ apatya) penances.\n\n26\\. Those twice-born men, by whom the Gayatri has not been repeated (and the\nother initiatory ceremonies performed), as the law directs, must be made to\nperform three (Pra _g_ apatya) penances and must be initiated according to\ncustom.\n\n27\\. Those twice-born men who are anxious to make an atonement for having\ncommitted an illegal act[1], or for having neglected the study of the Veda,\nmust be made to perform the same penance.\n\n28\\. Those Brahma _n_ as who have acquired property by base acts (such as\nliving by the occupations of a lower caste, or accepting unlawful presents)\nbecome free from sin by relinquishing it, and by muttering (Veda texts) and\npractising austerities.\n\n29\\. For omitting one of the regular acts enjoined in the revealed (and\ntraditional) law, and for a breach of the rules laid down for a Snataka[1], a\nfast is ordained as atonement.\n\n[26. The recitation and repetition of the Gayatri is one of the chief elements\nof the ceremony of initiation. The words with which the pupil must address his\nteacher on this occasion are given by Nand.; they are quoted from \xc3\x82 _s_ v. I,\n21, 4, and _S_ a _n_ kh. II, 5, 10-11. See also Gaut. I, 46, with Dr. Buhler\'s\nnote.\n\n27\\. 1 \'I.e. Brahma _n_ as and others who have gained their livelihood (in\ntimes of distress) by such occupations as are lawful for other castes only,\nand who, when the times of distress are over, wish to atone for those\nactions.\' (Nand.)\n\n29\\. 1 Regarding the meaning of this term, see above, XXVIII, 42, note. The\nrules to be observed by a Snataka are given in Chapter LXXI.]\n\np. 180\n\n30\\. For attacking a Brahma _n_ a (by raising a stick or a weapon against\nhim), the K _rikkh_ ra (Pra _g_ apatya) penance must be performed; for\nstriking him, the Atik _rikkh_ ra; and for fetching blood from him, the K\n_rikkh_ ratik _rikkh_ ra.\n\n31\\. With sinners, who have not expiated their crime, let a man not transact\nbusiness of any kind. But a man who knows the law must not blame (or shun)\nthose who have expiated it.\n\n32\\. Let him not, however, live (or have any intercourse) with those who have\nkilled children, or with ungrateful persons, or with those who have slain one\ncome for protection, or a woman, even though such sinners may have obtained\ntheir absolution, as directed by the law.\n\n33\\. (An old man) who has passed his eightieth year, a youth under the age of\nsixteen, women, and sick persons have only to perform half of every\npenance[1].\n\n34\\. In order to remove those sins for which no particular mode of expiation\nhas been mentioned, penances must be prescribed, which shall be in accordance\nwith the ability of the offender, and with the heaviness of his offence.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LV.](sbe07057.htm)\n\n'
