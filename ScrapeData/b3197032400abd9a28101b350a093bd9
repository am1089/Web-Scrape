That\negoism is stated to be the source of all entities 8,\n\np. 334\n\nthat from which the changes take place 1; it is full of light, the supporter\nof consciousness; it is that from which the people are produced, the Pra _g_\napati. It is a deity, the producer of the deities, and of the mind; it is the\ncreator of the three worlds. That which feels 2 thus--'I am all this'--is\ncalled (by) that (name). That eternal world is for those sages who are\ncontented with knowledge relating to the self, who have pondered on the self,\nand who are perfected by sacred study and sacrifice. By 3 consciousness of\nself one enjoys the qualities; and thus that source of all entities, the\nproducer of the entities, creates (them); and as that from which the changes\ntake place, it causes all this to move; and by its own light, it likewise\ncharms the world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[333:1](sbe0852.htm#fr_1627) I. e. says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, the world of the\nunderstanding. Does this mean the world of Hira _n_ yagarbha? The\nunderstanding is said to be the 'subtle body' of Hira _n_ yagarbha (Vedanta\nParibhasha, p. 46). Probably the reference spiritually interpreted is to the\nstate in which egoism and all its products are non-existent.\n\n[333:2](sbe0852.htm#fr_1628) Literally, 'the high and holy passage to the\ngreat self.'\n\n[333:3](sbe0852.htm#fr_1629) The Mahat first manifests itself as Vish _n_ u\nbefore it manifests itself as Brahman or _S_ iva (Sa _n_ khya-sara, p. 16),\nhence he is. sate to be the Lord in the primary creation. It may be added,\nthat in the Sa _n_ khya-sara where this passage is quoted the original word\nrendered 'cognition' above (khyati) does not occur. but in lieu of it occurs\nBrahman. The sentence 'And the talented man' &c. is also wanting there.\n\n[333:4](sbe0852.htm#fr_1630) I. e. the understanding. See _S_ a _n_ kara on\n_S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 329; Ka _th_ a, p. 100.\n\n[333:5](sbe0852.htm#fr_1631) Source of enlightenment, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\nCf. Mu _nd_ aka, pp. 303-308 (gloss).\n\n[333:6](sbe0852.htm#fr_1632) I. e. attaching himself to the Purusha, as the\nnever-changing reality, and rising above Prakriti and its manifestations.\n\n[333:7](sbe0853.htm#fr_1633) I. e. when the Mahat develops into the feeling of\nself-consciousness--I--then it assumes the name of egoism.\n\n[333:8](sbe0853.htm#fr_1634) See on this Sa _n_ khya-sara. Hall's Introd. p.\n31, note.\n\n[334:1](sbe0853.htm#fr_1635) So Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Nilaka _nth_ a says it\nmeans 'born from the change, or development, viz. Mahat.' The Sa _n_ khya-\nsara, p. 17, however, shows it means 'appertaining to the quality of\ngoodness.' See also Sa _n_ khya-karika 25, and commentary there, which is of\ngreat help here. The sense is this: Egoism is of three descriptions; it\nappertains to the quality of goodness, and as such is the creator of the\ndeities and mind, the deities being those presiding over the ten senses (cf.\nSa _n_ khya-sara, p. 17); it is full of light, or appertains to the quality of\npassion (cf. ibid.), and as such imparts to the other two qualities their\nvirtue of activity (cf. Sa _n_ khya- karika commentary, p. 91, Taranath's\ned.); it is also of the quality of darkness, and as such the producer of the:\ntriple world (see ibid.) See Sa _n_ khya-sutra II, 17, 18, and comment, where\na view somewhat different in one or two details is stated.\n\n[334:2](sbe0853.htm#fr_1636) Sa _n_ khya-sara, p. 16; Sa _n_ khya-karika 24,\np. 89 (Taranath's ed.)\n\n[334:3](sbe0853.htm#fr_1637) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says that the words Aha _n_\nkara &c. are here explained; qualities here means objects, as at Gita, [p.\n55](sbe0805.htm#page_55). The meaning of the first clause is, that the feeling\nthat the objects are for oneself, and therefore enjoying them, gives the name\nof Aha _n_ kara to the principle in question, its creation of all the elements\ngives it the name of Bhutadi. It is called Vaikarika, as the cause of the\nvarious activities and developments going on. The last clause seems to be an\nexplanation of the epithet Tai _g_ asa, also applied to egoism.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXVII](sbe0854.htm)\n\n"
