After having performed the Upakarman ceremony on the full moon of the\nmonth _S_ rava _n_ a, or of the month Bhadra, the student must (pass over the\ntwo next days without studying, and then) study for four months and a half.\n\n2\\. After that, the teacher must perform out of town the ceremony of Utsarga\nfor those students (that have acted up to this injunction); but not for those\nwho have failed to perform the ceremony of Upakarman.\n\n3\\. During the period (subsequent upon the ceremony of Upakarman and)\nintermediate between it and the ceremony of Utsarga, the student must read the\nVeda _n_ gas.\n\n4\\. He must interrupt his study for a day and a night on the fourteenth and\neighth days of a month[1].\n\n5\\. (He must interrupt his study for the next day\n\n[XXX. 1-33. Weber, Ind. Stud.

The latter, according to\nthe rule laid down in Sutra 1, would fall upon the first day of the moon's\nincrease, either in Pausha or in Magha. Nand. states that those students who\nhave not performed the Upakarman ceremony in due time must perform a penance\nbefore they can be admitted to the Utsarga; nor must those be admitted to it\nwho have failed to go on to the study of another branch of the Veda at the\nordinary time, after having absolved one.\n\n4\\. 1 Nand., with reference to a passage of Harita, considers the use of the\nplural and of the particle _k_ a to imply that the study must also be\ninterrupted on the first and fifteenth days.\n\n5\\. 1 This refers to the second days of the months Phalguna, \xc3\x82sha _dh_ a, and\nKarttika. (Nand.)]\n\np. 124\n\nand night) after a season of the year has begun[1], (and for three nights)\nafter an eclipse of the moon.\n\n6\\. (He must not study for a day and a night) when Indra's flag is hoisted or\ntaken down.\n\n7\\. (He must not study) when a strong wind is going,\n\n8\\. (He must not study for three days) when rain, lightning, and thunder\nhappen out of season[1].\n\n9\\. (He must not study till the same hour next day) in the case of an\nearthquake, of the fall of a meteor, and when the horizon is preternaturally\nred, as if on fire.\n\n10\\. (He must not study) in a village in which a corpse lies;\n\n11\\. Nor during a battle;\n\n12\\. Nor while dogs are barking, jackals yelling. or asses braying;\n\n13\\. Nor while the sound of a musical instrument is being, heard;\n\n14\\. Nor while _S_ udras or outcasts are near;\n\n15\\. Nor in the vicinity of a temple, of a burial-ground, of a place where\nfour ways meet, or of a high road;\n\n16\\. Nor while immersed in water;\n\n17\\. Nor with his foot placed upon a bench;\n\n18\\. Nor while riding upon an elephant, a horse, or a camel, (or in a carriage\ndrawn by any of those animals), or being borne in a boat, or in a carriage\ndrawn by oxen;\n\n19\\. Nor after having vomited;\n\n[8. 1 'I.e. not during the rains.' (Nand.)\n\n12\\. Nand. considers the term _s_ va, 'dog,' to include all the other animals\nmentioned by \xc3\x82pastamba, I, 3. 10, 17.\n\n19-21. After having vomited or been purged he shall interrupt {footnote p.\n125} his study for a day and a night; when suffering, from indigestion, till\nhe has digested his food. (Nand.)]\n\np. 125\n\n20\\. Nor after having been purged;\n\n21\\. Nor during an indigestion.\n\n22\\. When a five-toed animal has passed between the teacher and the pupil (the\nlatter must interrupt his study for a day and a night).\n\n23\\. When a king or a learned Brahma _n_ a (who has mastered one Veda), or a\ncow, or a Brahma _n_ a (in general) has met with an accident (he must not\nstudy).\n\n24\\. After the Upakarman (he must not study for three days).\n\n25\\. And after the Utsarga, (he must interrupt his study for as many days).\n\n26\\. And (he must avoid to study) the hymns of the Rig-veda, or those of the\nYa _g_ ur-veda, while the Saman melodies are being chanted.\n\n27\\. Let him not lie down to sleep again when he has begun to study in the\nsecond half of the night.\n\n28\\. Let him avoid studying at times when there ought to be an intermission of\nstudy, even though a question has been put to him (by his teacher);\n\n[22. According to Nand., the interruption of study is to last for two days,\nwhen a crow, or an owl, or a wild cock, or a mouse, or a frog, and the like\nanimals have passed; and for three days, when a dog, or an ichneumon, or a\nsnake, or a frog (sic), or a cat has passed. He quotes Gaut. I, 59 in support\nof his interpretation. I have translated according to M. W, 126; Y. I, 147.\n\n23\\. in these cases the study shall not be taken up again till the accident\nhas been appeased by propitiatory rites. If any of the persons in question has\ndied, the interruption is to last for a day and a night, in case they were\npersons of little merit; but in case they should have been very virtuous, it\nis to last for three days. (Nand.)\n\n28\\. Every lesson consists of questions put by the teacher and the pupil's\nanswers to them.]\n\np. 126\n\n29\\. Since to study on forbidden days neither benefits him in this nor in the\nother world.\n\n30\\. To study on such days destroys the life of both teacher and pupil.\n\n31\\. Therefore should a teacher, who wishes to obtain the world of Brahman,\navoid improper days, and sow (on proper days) the seed of sacred knowledge on\nsoil consisting of virtuous pupils.\n\n32\\. At the beginning and at the end of the lecture let the pupil embrace his\nteacher's feet;\n\n33\\. And let him pronounce the sacred syllable Om.\n\n34\\. Now he who studies the hymns of the _Ri_ g-veda (regularly), feeds the\nmanes with clarified butter.\n\n35\\. He who studies the Ya _g_ us texts, (feeds them) with honey.\n\n36\\. He who studies the Saman melodies, (feeds them) with milk.\n\n37\\. He who studies the Atharva-veda, (feeds them) with meat.\n\n38\\. He who studies the Pura _n_ as, Itihasas, Veda _n_ gas, and the\nInstitutes of Sacred Law, feeds them with rice.\n\n39\\. He who having collected sacred knowledge, gains his substance by it in\nthis world, will derive no benefit from it in the world to come.\n\n[33. Nand., quoting a passage of Yama, states the particle _k_ a to imply that\nthe pupil must touch the ground, after having pronounced the syllable Om.\n\n38\\. Nand. considers the use of a Dvandva compound to imply that logic (Nyaya)\nand the Mima _m_ sa system of philosophy are also intended in this Sutra.\nRegarding the meaning of the terms Pura _n_ a and Itihasa, see Max Muller,\nAncient Sanskrit Literature, p. 40 seq.\n\n39\\. This rule cannot refer to teaching for a reward, because {footnote p.\n127} that is a minor offence (upapataka; see below, XXXVII, 20); nor can it\nrefer to teaching in general, because it is lawful to gain one's substance by\nit; but it refers to those who recite the Veda in behalf of another, and live\nby doing so. (Nand.)]\n\np. 127\n\n40\\. Neither will he (derive such benefit from it), who uses his knowledge in\norder to destroy the reputation of others (by defeating them in argument).\n\n41\\. Let no one acquire sacred knowledge, without his teacher's permission,\nfrom another who is studying divine science.\n\n42 . Acquiring it in that way constitutes theft of the Veda, and will bring\nhim into hell.\n\n43\\. Let (a student) never grieve that man from whom he has obtained worldly\nknowledge (relating to poetry, rhetoric, and the like subjects), sacred\nknowledge (relating to the Vedas and Veda _n_ gas), or knowledge of the\nSupreme Spirit.\n\n44\\. Of the natural progenitor and the teacher who imparts the Veda to him,\nthe giver of the Veda is the more venerable father; for it is the new\nexistence acquired by his initiation in the Veda, which will last him both in\nthis life and the next.\n\n45\\. Let him consider as a merely human existence that which he owes to his\nfather and mother uniting from carnal desire and to his being born from his\nmother's womb.\n\n46\\. That existence which his teacher, who knows all the Vedas, effects for\nhim through the prescribed rites of initiation with (his divine mother) the\nGayatri, is a true existence; that existence is exempt from age and death.\n\n47\\. He who fills his ears with holy truths, who\n\n[41. See XXVIII, 6, and the preceding note.]\n\np. 128\n\nfrees him from all pain (in this world and the next). and confers immortality\n(or final liberation) upon him, that man let the student consider as his\n(true) father and mother: gratefully acknowledging the debt he owes him, he\nmust never grieve him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXXI.](sbe07033.htm)\n\n"
