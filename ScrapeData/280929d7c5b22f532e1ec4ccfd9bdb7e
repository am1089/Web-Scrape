And the goblin said: "O king, listen\nto a story the like of which was never heard."\n\n\n\nThere is a mountain called Himalaya where all gems are found. It is the king\nof mountains. Its proud loftiness is everywhere the theme of song. The sun\nhimself has not seen its top.\n\nOn its summit is a city called Golden City, brilliant like a heap of sunbeams\nleft in trust by the sun. There lived a glorious fairy-king named Cloud-\nbanner. In the garden of his palace was a wishing-tree which had come down to\nhim from his ancestors.\n\nKing Cloud-banner had worshipped the tree which was really a god, and by its\ngrace had obtained a son named Cloud-chariot. This son remembered his former\nlives. He was destined to be a Buddha in a future life. He was generous,\nnoble, merciful to all creatures, and obedient to his parents.\n\nWhen he grew up, the king anointed him crown prince, persuaded thereto by his\ncounsellors as well as by the remarkable virtues of the youth. While Cloud-\nchariot was crown prince, his father\'s counsellors came to him one day and\nkindly said: "Crown prince, you must always honour this wishing-tree in your\ngarden; for it yields all desires, and cannot be taken away by anybody. As\nlong as it is favourably disposed to us, the king of the gods could not\nconquer us, and of course nobody else could."\n\nThen Cloud-chariot thought: "Alas! The men of old had this heavenly tree, yet\nthey did not pluck from it any worthy fruit. They were mean-spirited. They\nsimply begged it for some kind of wealth. And so they degraded themselves and\nthe great tree too. But I will get from it the wish which is in my heart."\n\nWith this thought the noble creature went to his father. He showed such\ncomplete deference as to delight his father, then when his father was\ncomfortably seated, he whispered: "Father, you know yourself that in this sea\nof life all possessions, including our own bodies, are uncertain as a rippling\nwave. Especially is money fleeting, uncertain, fickle as the twilight\nlightning. The only thing in life which does not perish is service. This gives\nbirth to virtue and glory, twin witnesses through all the ages to come.\nFather! Why do we keep such a wishing-tree for the sake of transient\nblessings? Our ancestors clung to it, saying: It is mine, it is mine.\' And\nwhere are they now? What is it to them, or they to it? Then, if you bid me, I\nwill beg this generous wishing-tree for the one fruit that counts, the fruit\nof service to others."\n\nHis father graciously assented, and Cloud-chariot went to the wishing-tree,\nand said: "O god, you have fulfilled the wishes of our fathers. Fulfil now my\none single wish. Remove poverty from the world. A blessing be with you. Go. I\ngive you to the needy world." And as Cloud-chariot bowed reverently, there\ncame a voice from the tree: "I go, since you give me up." And the wishing-tree\nimmediately flew from heaven and rained so much money on the earth that nobody\nwas poor. And Cloud-chariot\'s reputation for universal benevolence was spread\nabout.\n\nBut all the relatives were jealous and envious. They thought that they could\neasily conquer Cloud-chariot and his father without the wishing-tree, and they\nprepared to fight to take away his kingdom. But Cloud-chariot said to his\nfather: "Father, how can you take your weapons and fight? What high-minded man\nwould want a kingdom after killing his relatives just for the sake of this\nwretched, perishable body? Let us abandon the kingdom, and go away somewhere\nto devote ourselves entirely to virtue. Then we shall be blessed in both\nworlds. And let these wretched  relatives enjoy the kingdom which they hanker\nafter."\n\nAnd Cloud-banner said: "My son, I only want the kingdom for you, and if you\ngive it up from benevolent motives, what good is it to me? I am an old man."\n\nSo Cloud-chariot left the kingdom and went with his father and mother to the\nMalabar hills. There he built a hermit\'s retreat, and waited on his parents.\n\nOne day, as he wandered about, he met Friend-wealth, the son of All-wealth,\nwho lived there as king of the Siddhas. And Cloud-chariot spoke to him and\nmade friends with him.\n\nThen one day Cloud-chariot saw a shrine to the goddess Gauri in the grove, and\nentered there. And he saw a slender, lovely maiden surrounded by her girl\nfriends and playing on a lute, in honour of Gauri. The deer listened to her\nmusic and her song, motionless as if ashamed because her eyes were lovelier\nthan their own. When Cloud-chariot saw the slender maiden, his heart was\nravished.\n\nAnd he seemed to her to make the garden beautiful like the spring-time. A\nstrange longing came over her. She became so helpless that her friends were\nalarmed.\n\nThen Cloud-chariot asked one of her friends: "My good girl, what is your\nfriend\'s sweet name? What family does she adorn?"\n\nAnd the friend said: "This is Sandal, sister of Friend-wealth, and daughter of\nthe king of the Siddhas." Then she earnestly asked for the name and family of\nCloud-Chariot from a hermit\'s son who had come with him. And then she spoke to\nSandal with words punctuated by smiles: "My dear, why do you not show\nhospitality to the fairy prince? He is a guest whom all the world would be\nglad to honour."\n\nBut the bashful princess remained silent with downcast eyes. Then the friend\nsaid: "She is bashful. Accept a hospitable greeting from me." And she gave him\na garland.\n\nCloud-chariot, far gone in love, took the garland and put it around Sandal\'s\nneck. And the loving, sidelong glance which she gave him seemed like another\ngarland of blue lotuses. So they pledged themselves without speaking a word.\n\nThen a serving-maid came and said to the princess: "Princess, your mother\nremembers you. Come at once." And she went slowly, after drawing from her\nlover\'s face a passionate glance, for which Love\'s arrow had wedged a path.\nAnd Cloud-chariot went to the hermitage, thinking of her; while she, sick with\nthe separation from the lord of her life, saw her mother, then tottered to her\nbed and fell upon it. Her eyes were blinded as if by smoke from the  fire of\nlove within her, her limbs tossed in fever, she shed tears. And though her\nfriends anointed her with sandal and fanned her with lotus-leaves, she found\nno rest on her bed or in the lap of a friend or on the ground.\n\nThen when the day fled away with the passionate red twilight, and the moon\ndrew near to kiss the face of the laughing East, she despaired of life, and\nher modesty would not let her send a message in spite of all her love. But\nsomehow she lived through the night. And Cloud-chariot too was in anguish at\nthe separation. Even in his bed he was fallen into the hand of Love. Though\nhis passion was so recent, he had already grown pale. Though shame kept him\nsilent, his looks told of the pangs of love. And so he passed the night.\n\nIn the morning he arose and went to the shrine of Gauri. And his friend, the\nhermit\'s son, followed him and tried to comfort him. At that moment the\nlovelorn Sandal came out of her house alone, for she could not endure the\nseparation, and crept to that lonely spot to end her life there.\n\nShe did not see her lover behind a tree, and with eyes brimming with tears she\nprayed to the goddess Gauri: "O goddess, since I could not in this life have\nCloud-chariot as my husband, grant that in another life at last he may be my\nhusband."\n\nThen she tied her garment to the limb of an ashoka tree before the goddess and\ncried: "Alas, my lord! Alas,  Cloud-chariot! They say your benevolence is\nuniversal. Why did you not save me?"\n\nBut as she fastened the garment about her neck, a voice from the sky was heard\nin the air: "My daughter, do nothing rash. Cloud-chariot, the future king of\nthe fairies, shall be your husband."\n\nAnd Cloud-chariot heard the heavenly voice, and with his friend approached his\nrejoicing sweetheart. The friend said to the girl: "Here is the gift which the\ngoddess grants you." And Cloud-chariot spoke more than one tender word and\nloosed the garment from her neck with his own hand.\n\nThen a girl friend who had been gathering flowers there and had seen what was\nhappening, came up joyfully and said, while Sandal\'s modest eyes seemed to be\ntracing a figure on the ground: "My dear, I congratulate you. Your wish is\ngranted. This very day Prince Friend-wealth said in my presence to King All-\nwealth, your father: Father, the fairy prince, who deserves honour from all\nthe world, who gave away the wishing-tree, is here, and we should treat him as\nan honoured guest. We could not find another bridegroom like him. So let us\nwelcome him with the gift of Sandal who is a pearl of a girl.\' And the king\nagreed, and your brother Friend-wealth has this moment gone to the hermitage\nof the noble prince. I think your marriage will soon take place. So go to your\nchamber, and let the noble prince go to his hermitage."\n\nSo she went slowly and happily and lovingly. And Cloud-chariot hastened to the\nhermitage. There he greeted Friend-wealth and heard his message, and told him\nabout his own birth and former life. Then Friend-wealth was delighted and told\nCloud-chariot\'s parents who were also delighted. Then he went home and made\nhis own parents happy with the news.\n\nThat very day he invited Cloud-chariot to his home. And they made a great\nfeast as was proper, and married the fairy prince and Sandal on the spot. Then\nCloud-chariot was completely happy and spent some time there with his bride\nSandal.\n\nOne day he took a walk for pleasure about the hills with Friend-wealth, and\ncame to the seashore. There he saw great heaps of bones, and he asked Friend-\nwealth: "What creatures did these heaps of bones belong to?" His brother-in-\nlaw Friend-wealth said to the merciful prince: "Listen, my friend. I will tell\nyou the story briefly."\n\nLong ago Kadru, the mother of the serpents, made a wager with her rival\nVinata, the mother of the great bird Garuda. She won the wager and enslaved\nher rival. Now Garuda\'s anger continued even after he had freed his mother\nfrom slavery. He kept going into the underworld where Kadru\'s offspring, the\nserpents, live, to eat them. Some he killed, others he crushed.\n\nThen Vasuki, king of the serpents, feared that in time all would be lost if\nthe serpents were all to be slain thus. So he made an agreement with Garuda.\nHe said: "O king of birds, I will send one serpent every day to the shore of\nthe southern sea for you to eat. But you are never to enter the underworld\nagain. What advantage would it be to you if all the serpents were slain at\nonce?" And Garuda agreed, with an eye to his own advantage.\n\nSince that time Garuda every day eats the snake sent by Vasuki here on the\nseashore. And these heaps of bones from the serpents that have been eaten,\nhave in time formed a regular mountain.\n\nWhen Cloud-chariot heard this story from the lips of Friend-wealth, he was\ndeeply grieved and said: "My friend, wretched indeed is that king Vasuki who\ndeliberately sacrifices his own subjects to their enemy. He is a coward. He\nhas a thousand heads, yet could not find a single mouth to say: O Garuda, eat\nme first.\' How could he be so mean as to beg Garuda to destroy his own race?\nOr how can Garuda, the heavenly bird, do such a crime? Oh, insolent madness!"\n\nSo the noble Cloud-chariot made up his mind that he would use his poor body\nthat day to save the life of one serpent at least. At that moment a door-\nkeeper, sent by Friend-wealth\'s father, came to summon them home. And Cloud-\nChariot said: "Do you go first. I will follow." So he dismissed Friend-wealth,\nand remained there himself.\n\nAs he walked about waiting for the thing he hoped for, he heard a pitiful\nsound of weeping at a distance. He went a little way and saw near a lofty rock\na sorrowful, handsome youth. He was at that moment abandoned by a creature\nthat seemed to be a policeman, and was gently persuading his old, weeping\nmother to return. And Cloud-chariot wished to know who it might be. So he hid\nhimself and listened, his heart melting with pity.\n\nThe old mother was bowed down by anguish, and started to lament over the\nyouth. "Oh, Shell-crest! Oh, my virtuous son, whom I fondled, not counting the\nlabour and the pain! Oh, my son, my only son! Where shall I see you again? Oh,\nmy darling! When your bright face is gone, your old father will fall into\nblack despair. How can he live then? Your tender form is hurt by the rays of\nthe sun. How can it bear the pangs of being eaten by Garuda? Oh, my unhappy\nfate! Why did the Creator and the serpent-king choose my only son from the\nbroad serpent-world, and seize upon him?"\n\nAnd as she lamented, the youth, her son, said: "Mother, I am unhappy enough.\nWhy torture me yet more? Return home. For the last time I bow before you. It\nis time for Garuda to come."\n\nAnd the mother cried: "Alas, alas for me! Who will save my son?" And she gazed\nabout wildly and wept aloud.\n\nAll this Cloud-chariot, the future Buddha, saw and heard. And with deep pity\nhe thought: "Alas! This is a serpent named Shell-crest, sent here by Vasuki\nfor Garuda to eat. And this is his mother, following him out of her great\nlove. He is her only son, and she is mourning in pain and bitter anguish. I\nshould forever curse my useless life if I did not save one in such agony at\nthe cost of a body which must perish anyway some day."\n\nSo Cloud-chariot joyfully approached and said to the old mother: "Serpent-\nmother, I will save your son. Do not weep."\n\nBut the old mother thought that this was Garuda, and she screamed: "O Garuda,\neat me! Eat me!"\n\nThen Shell-crest said: "Mother, this is not Garuda. Do not be alarmed. What a\ndifference between one who soothes our feelings like the moon, and the fearful\nGaruda."\n\nAnd Cloud-chariot said: "Mother, I am a fairy, come to save your son. I will\nput on his garment and offer my own body to the hungry bird. Do you take your\nson and go home."\n\nBut the old mother said: "No, no. You are more than a son to me. To think that\nsuch as you should feel pity for such as we!"\n\nAnd Cloud-chariot answered: "Mother, I beg you not to disappoint me." But when\nhe insisted, Shell-crest said: "Noble being, you have certainly shown\ncompassion, but I do not wish to save my body at the expense of yours. Who\nwould save a common stone at the cost of a pearl? The world is full of\ncreatures like me, who are merciful only to themselves. But creatures like\nyou, who are merciful to all the world, are very rare. Oh, pious being, I\ncould not stain the pure family of Shell-guard, as the dark spot stains the\ndisk on the moon."\n\nThen Shell-crest said to his mother: "Mother, return from this desolate place.\nDo you not see the rock of sacrifice wet with the blood of serpents, the\nterrible plaything of Death? I will go for a moment to the shore and worship\nthe god Shiva there. And I will return quickly before Garuda comes."\n\nSo Shell-crest took leave of his mother and went to worship Shiva. And Cloud-\nchariot thought: "If Garuda should come in this interval, I should be happy."\n\nThen he saw the trees stiffening themselves against the wind made by the\nsweeping wings of the king of birds. "Garuda is coming," he thought, and\nclimbed the rock of sacrifice, eager to give his life for another.\n\nAnd Garuda straightway pounced upon the noble creature and lifted him from the\nrock in his beak. While Cloud-chariot\'s blood flowed in streams and the gem\nfell from his forehead, Garuda carried him off and began to eat him on the\nsummit of the Malabar hills. And while he was being eaten, Cloud-chariot\nthought: "In every future life of mine may my body do some good to somebody. I\nwould not attain heaven and salvation without doing some  good first." Then a\nshower of flowers fell from heaven on the fairy prince.\n\nAt that moment the blood-stained gem from his forehead fell in front of his\nwife Sandal. She was in anguish at the sight, and as her parents-in-law were\nnear, she tearfully showed it to them. And they were alarmed at the sight of\ntheir son\'s gem and wondered what it meant. Then King Cloud-banner discovered\nthe truth by his magic arts, and he and his queen started to run with Cloud-\nchariot\'s wife Sandal.\n\nAt that moment Shell-crest returned from his worship of Shiva. He saw the rock\nstained with blood, and cried: "Alas for me, poor sinner! Surely that noble,\nmerciful creature has given his body to Garuda in place of mine. I must find\nhim. Where has the great being been carried by my enemy? If I find him alive,\nthen I shall not sink into the slough of infamy." So he followed weeping the\nbroad trail of blood.\n\nNow Garuda noticed that Cloud-chariot was happy while being eaten, and he\nthought: "This must be some strange, great being, for he is happy while I am\neating him. He does not die, and what remains of him is thrilled with delight.\nAnd he turns a gracious, benevolent look upon me. Surely, he is no serpent,\nbut some great spirit. I will stop eating him and ask him."\n\nBut while he reflected, Cloud-chariot said: "O king of birds, why do you stop?\nThere is still some flesh and blood on me, and I see that you are not\nsatisfied. Pray continue to eat."\n\nWhen the king of birds heard these remarkable words, he said: "You are no\nserpent. Tell me who you are."\n\nBut Cloud-chariot continued to urge him: "Certainly I am a serpent. What does\nthe question mean? Continue your meal. What fool would begin a thing and then\nstop?"\n\nAt that moment Shell-crest shouted from afar: "O Garuda, do not commit a great\nand reckless crime. What madness is this? He is not a serpent. I am the\nserpent."\n\nAnd he ran between them and spoke again to the agitated bird: "O Garuda, what\nmadness is this? Do you not see that I have the hood and the forked tongue? Do\nyou not see how gentle his appearance is?"\n\nWhile he was speaking, Cloud-chariot\'s wife Sandal and his parents hurried up.\nAnd when his parents saw how he was lacerated, they wept aloud and lamented:\n"Alas, my son! Alas, Cloud-chariot! Alas for my merciful darling, who gave his\nlife for others!"\n\nBut when they cried: "Alas, Garuda! How could you do this thoughtless thing?"\nthen Garuda was filled with remorse and thought: "Alas! How could I be mad\nenough to eat a future Buddha? This must be Cloud-chariot, who gives his life\nfor others, whose fame is trumpeted abroad through all the world. If he is\ndead, I am a sinner, and ought to burn myself alive. Why does the fruit of the\npoison-tree of sin taste sweet?"\n\nWhile Garuda was thus deep in anxious thought, Cloud-chariot saw his relatives\ngathered, fell down, and died from the pain of his wounds. Then, while his\ngrief-stricken parents were loudly lamenting, while Shell-crest was accusing\nhimself, Sandal looked up to heaven and, in a voice stammering with tears,\nreproached the goddess Gauri who had graciously given her this husband: "Oh,\nMother! You told me that the fairy prince should be my husband, but it is my\nfate that you spoke falsely."\n\nThen Gauri appeared in a visible form, and said: "Daughter, my words are not\nfalse." And she sprinkled Cloud-chariot with nectar from a jar. And\nstraightway he stood up alive, unhurt and more beautiful than before.\n\nAs they all bent low in worship, and Cloud-chariot rose only to bend again,\nthe goddess said: "My son, I am pleased with your gift of your own body. With\nmy own hand I anoint you king of the fairies." And she anointed Cloud-chariot\nwith liquor from the jar, and then disappeared, followed by the worship of the\ncompany. And showers of heavenly blossoms fell from the sky, and the drums of\nthe gods were joyfully beaten in heaven.\n\nThen Garuda reverently said to Cloud-chariot: "O King, I am pleased with your\nmore than human character. For you have done a strange thing of unparalleled\nnobility, to be marvelled at throughout the universe, to be written upon the\nwalls of heaven. Therefore I am at your service. Choose from me what boon you\nwill."\n\nThe noble creature said to Garuda: "O Garuda, you must repent and eat no more\nserpents. And you must restore to life those that you ate before, who now are\nnothing but bones."\n\nAnd Garuda said: "So be it. I will eat no serpents hereafter. And those that I\nhave eaten shall come to life."\n\nThen all the serpents who had been eaten down to the bones, suddenly stood up.\nAnd through the grace of Gauri all the leading fairies learned immediately the\nwonderful deed of Cloud-chariot. So they all came and bowed at his feet and\ntook him, freshly anointed by the very hand of Gauri, with his rejoicing\nrelatives and friends to the Himalaya mountain. There Cloud-chariot lived\nhappily with his father and his mother and his wife Sandal and Friend-wealth\nand the generous Shell-crest. And he ruled the fairy world radiant with gems.\n\n\n\n  \nWhen the goblin had told this long, strange story, he said to the king: "O\nKing, tell me. Which was the more self-sacrificing, Cloud-chariot or Shell-\ncrest? If you know and do not tell, then the curse I mentioned before will be\nfulfilled."\n\nAnd the king said: "There was nothing remarkable in what Cloud-chariot did. He\nwas prepared for it by the experiences of many past lives. But Shell-crest\ndeserves praise. He was saved from death. His enemy had another victim, and\nwas far away. Yet he ran after and offered his body to Garuda."\n\nWhen the goblin heard this, he went back to the sissoo tree. And the king\nreturned to catch him again.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sixteenth Goblin: The King who died for Love of his General\'s Wife; the\nGeneral follows him in Death.
