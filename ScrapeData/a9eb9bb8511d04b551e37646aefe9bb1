He then pours water into it (the hole), for whatever is injured or\ntorn in this earth that is healed by water: by means of the water he thus\njoins together and heals what is injured and torn in her.\n\np. 221\n\n6:4:3:22\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 38] 'Let flow the divine waters, the honey-sweet,\nfor health, for progeny!'--honey means sap (essence): thus, 'the sapful, for\nhealth, for progeny;'--'from their seed let plants spring forth, full-\nberried!' for full-berried plants indeed spring forth from the seat of the\nwaters.\n\n6:4:3:33\\. He then heals her with air 1; for whatever is injured and torn in\nthis earth that is healed by the air: by means of air he thus joins together\nand heals what is injured and torn in her.\n\n6:4:3:44\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 39] 'May Vayu Matari _s_ van heal,'--Vayu Matari\n_s_ van, doubtless, is he (the wind) that blows yonder;--'the broken heart of\nthee stretched out with upward look!' for this (hole) is the broken heart of\nthis earth stretched out with upward look;--'thou who goest along by the\nbreath of the gods,'--for he (the wind) indeed goes along by means of the\nbreath of all the gods;--'to thee, Ka, be vasha _t_ (success), O god!'--Ka\n('Who?') doubtless is Pra _g_ apati, for him he makes this earth to be the\nVasha _t_ , for there is so far no other oblation than that.\n\n6:4:3:55\\. He then heals her by means of the quarters, for whatever is injured\nand torn in this earth, that is healed by the quarters: by means of the\nquarters he thus draws and joins together what is injured and torn in her. He\njoins together this and this quarter 2, whence these two quarters are joined\n\np. 222\n\ntogether; then this one and this one, whence these two also are joined\ntogether: first thus, then thus; then thus, then thus. This is moving (from\nleft) to right, for so (it goes) to the gods: with this and this one a means\nof healing is prepared; with this and this one he heals.\n\n6:4:3:66\\. He then takes up together the black antelope skin and the lotus-\nleaf; for the lotus-leaf is the womb, and with the womb he takes up that\ninfused seed: whence the infused seed is taken up by the womb. [He does so,\nwith, Va _g_. S. XI, 40] 'Wellborn with splendour, the refuge and shelter,\nhath he settled down in the light;' for well-born he is, and he settles down\nin the refuge, and shelter, and light.\n\n6:4:3:77\\. He then ties it (the lump) up: he thereby keeps the seed within the\nwomb; whence the seed kept within the womb does not escape. With a string (he\nties it), for with the string they yoke the draught beast;--with a triple one\nof reed grass: the significance of this has been told 1.\n\n6:4:3:88\\. He lays it round (the skin), with, 'Invest thyself, O lustrous\nAgni, in the many-coloured garment!' In the sacrifice the cord is Varu _n_ ic;\nhaving thereby made it non-Varu _n_ ic, he makes him put on (the skin) as one\nwould make a garment be put on.\n\n6:4:3:99\\. He then takes it and rises;--that Agni being yonder sun, he thus\ncauses yonder sun to rise;--with (Va _g_. S. XI, 41) 2, 'Rise, thou of good\nrites,'--the sacrifice doubtless is a rite: thus, 'rise thou, well\n\np. 223\n\nworthy of sacrifice;'--'Guard us with godly wisdom!'--that is, 'whatever\ndivine wisdom is thine, therewith guard us!'--'Most brilliant to see with\ngreat light,'--that is, 'in order to be seen most brilliant with great\nlight;'--'hither, O Agni, come thou with praises!'--the praises 1 are the\nsteeds: thus, 'hither, O Agni, come with the steeds.'\n\n6:4:3:1010\\. He then lifts it upwards from there towards the east; for this\nAgni is yonder sun: he thus places yonder sun upwards from here in the east,\nand hence yonder sun is placed upwards from here in the east. [He does so,\nwith, Va _g_. S. XI, 42; _Ri_ k S. I, 36, 13] 'Upright for our protection,\nstand thou like the god Savit _ri_!'--as the text, so its meaning;--'upright,\nas a bestower 2 of strength,'--for standing upright he (the sun) indeed\nbestows 2 strength, food;--'when we utter our call with the shining offerers'\n--the shining offerers 3, doubtless, are his (the sun's) rays: it is these he\nmeans. He lifts it up beyond the reach of his arms, for beyond the reach of\nhis arms is that (sun) from here. He then lowers it; and having lowered it, he\nholds it above the navel: the meaning of this (will be explained) hereafter 4.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[220:1](sbe4138.htm#fr_444) See VI, 2, 2, 23.\n\n[221:1](sbe4139.htm#fr_445) Viz. by fanning air into the hole with the hand.\n\n[221:2](sbe4139.htm#fr_446) With his 'nameless' (or little) finger, he pushes\nsome of the loose soil into the hole, first from the front (east) and back\n(west) . sides, and then from the right (south) and left (north) sides.
