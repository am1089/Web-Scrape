(Now follows some) advice for him who is desirous of offspring.\n\n2\\. The two A _s_ vins have declared, that fame is gained by the procreation\n(of sons);\n\n3\\. \'Performing acts which tend to prolong life and austerities, intent on the\nperformance of the private recitation and of sacrifices, and keeping his\norgans in subjection, let him carefully beget offspring in his own caste.\'\n\n4\\. \'From his birth a Brahma _n_ a is loaded with three debts; these let him\npay. A prudent man is free from doubts regarding the sacred law.\'\n\n5\\. \'If he worships the sages through the study of the Veda, Indra with Soma\nsacrifices, and the manes of his ancestors through (the procreation of)\nchildren, he will rejoice in heaven, free from debt.\'\n\n6\\. \'Through a son he conquers the worlds, through a grandson he obtains\nimmortality, but through his son\'s grandson he ascends to the (highest)\nheaven.\' (All that) has been declared in the Veda. 6\n\n7\\. The Veda shows the existence of the three debts in the following\n(passage): \'A Brahma _n_ a is born loaded with three debts; (he owes) the\nstudentship to the sages, sacrifices to the gods, and a son to the manes;\' 7\n\np. 272\n\n8\\. Through the procreation of a virtuous son he saves himself.\n\n9\\. He who obtains a virtuous son saves from the fear of sin seven in the\ndescending line and seven in the ascending line, (viz.) six others (in each),\nhimself being the seventh.\n\n10\\. Therefore he obtains a reward if he begets issue.\n\n11\\. Therefore he should sedulously beget offspring, 11\n\np. 273\n\n12\\. Through the application of medicines and sacred texts.\n\n13\\. The advice to him (who is intent on the procreation of children) is given\nin agreement with the revealed texts. 13\n\n14\\. For it produces results in the case of all the castes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[271:6](sbe1470.htm#fr_1289) Vasish _th_ a XVII, 5.\n\n[271:7](sbe1470.htm#fr_1290) Vasish _th_ a XI, 48. After this Sutra the MSS.\nof the text p. 272 insert the following corrupt passage: bandham ri _n_\namoksham pra _g_ aya _s_ _k_ ayattam pi _t_ _r i_na _m_ _k_ anukarsha _s_ abda\n_s_ _k_ a pra _g_ aya _m_ dar _s_ ayati | anutsanna _h_ pra _g_ avan bhavati |\nya vad ena _m_ pra _g_ anug _ri_ h _n_ ite tavad akshaya _m_ loka _m_ gayati.\nThe commentary does not notice it, and it seems to me that it needlessly\ninterrupts the context.\n\n[272:11](sbe1470.htm#fr_1291) M. and K. add to this Sutra, atmana _h_\nphalalabhaya, \'in order to gain a reward for himself.\' The same two MSS.,\nfurther, insert the following Sutras: tasmat putra _m_ _k_ otpadyatmanam\nevotpadayatiti | vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ayate _k_ atma vai putranamasiti | eva _m_ dvitiya\natma _g_ ivata drash _t_ avyo ya _h_ putram utpadayati | sa tatha bhavati |\ntasman natma kva _k_ id akshetra utsrash _t_ avya _h_ | atmanam avamanyate hi\n| yathatmanam utpadayati sa tatha bhavati | tasmad adita eva kshetram anvi _k_\n_kh_ et sarvavar _n_ e sa _m_ sk _ri_ tam upade _s_ ena | tasmin darasa _m_\nyoge pra _g_ am utpadayed || \'Therefore (they say) that he who begets a son\nproduces even his own self; and it is declared in the Veda, "Thou art self,\ncalled a son." Thus he who begets a son will see, during his lifetime, a\nsecond self. He becomes like him. Therefore one\'s own self must not be\nbegotten on an unworthy female. For (he who does that) despises himself. He\nbecomes even so, as he produces himself. Therefore (every man), each in his\nown caste, should first look out for a female who has been sanctified\naccording to the injunction (of the sacred texts). Taking her to be his wedded\nwife, he shall beget a son.\' It is possible that this passage really belongs\nto Baudhayana, for it is written in the usual style of our Sutra, and the last\nword of this passage as well as of Sutra 11, as given in the Dekhan MSS., is\nutpadayet. But it is not absolutely required by the context, and the\ncommentary too omits it.\n\n[273:13](sbe1470.htm#fr_1292) I read with M., whose reading is confirmed by\nthe explanation given in the commentary, tasyopade _s_ a _h_ _s_\nrutisamanyenopadi _s_ yate. The other MS. reads tasyopade _s_ ena, and in the\ntext of the commentary the first word is left out.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Adhyaya 10, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 17](sbe1471.htm)\n\n'
