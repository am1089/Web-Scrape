Going forward to the sacrifice let us repeat a prayer to Agni who hears\nus, may he be afar or with us--\n\n2\\. He who foremost [1](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:2:1) in \xe2\x80\xa6\n[2](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:2:2), when the human tribes met (in battle), has\npreserved his home to the worshipper.\n\n3\\. And let the people say 'Agni is born, the slayer of foes (or, the slayer\nof V _ri_ tra), he who wins the prize in every battle.'\n\n4\\. The man in whose home thou art a messenger, and to whose sacrificial food\nthou eagerly comest for feasting, to whose worship thou impartest wonderful\npower--\n\n5\\. Such a man the people call a giver of good oblations, O A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, a friend\nof the gods, O son of strength [1](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:5:1), and a possessor\nof a good Barhis (or sacrificial grass).\n\n6\\. And thou shalt conduct them hither, the gods\n[1](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:6:1), that we may praise them, that they may eagerly\ncome, O resplendent one, to the sacrificial offerings.\n\n7\\. No noise [1](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:7:1) of the horses of the moving chariot\n[2](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:7:2) is heard any way, when thou goest on thy\nmessengership, O Agni.\n\n8\\. When guarded by thee the racer becomes fearless; the worshipper, O Agni,\nwho is behind, gains the advantage [1](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:8:1) over him who\nis ahead.\n\np. 93\n\n9\\. And thou winnest, O Agni, brilliant, high bliss in strong heroes from the\ngods, O god, for the worshipper.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn opens the section ascribed to Gotama Rahuga _n_ a, and belonging\nindeed, as several passages show, to the family of the Gotamas (comp.\nZeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLII, 221). The metre is Gayatri.--\nVerse 1 = VS. III, 11; TS. I, 5, 5, 1; MS. I, 5, 1 (I, 5, 5. 6). Verses 1-3 =\nSV. II, 729. 730. 732. Verse 3 = TS. III, 5, 11, 4; MS. IV, 10, 3.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Or purvya _h_ , 'the old Agni,' cf. IX, 96, 10? (M. M.)\n\nNote 2. I have left untranslated the obscure word sni\xc2\xb4hitishu (Saya _n_ a,\nvadhakari _n_ ishu). It seems to be identical with snehiti, which occurs VIII,\n96, 13. apa snehiti _h_ n _ri_ mana _h_ adhatta (the Sama-veda has the reading\nsnih\xc2\xb0). Here the verb apa adhatta (comp. VI., 20, 5; X, 164, 3) and the\ncomparison of the second hemistichs of the two following verses, 14 and 15,\nseem to show that the word means some kind of hostile powers, which would do\nvery well for our passage.--In Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka IV, 23 the word\nsni\xc2\xb4hiti occurs in an enumeration of the 'terrible substances' (ghora\xc2\xb4 _h_\ntanuva _h_ ) of Agni.--Comp. Ludwig, Ueber die neuesten Arbeiten auf dem\nGebiete der _Ri_ g-veda-Forschung, p. 93.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. See above, I, 26, 10, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. See Delbruck, Syntaktische Forschungen, I, 20, 111.\n\np. 94\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. On upabdi, which literally means the noise produced by going, see Joh.\nSchmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, 55; Hubschmann, Das indogermanische Vocal-\nsystem, 124.\n\nNote 2. Yo _h_ (comp. X, 176, 3?) seems to be a genitive of yu, 'the going\none;' comp. sva-yu, _s_ ubham-yu; Lanman, 401.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The last syllable of asthat has the value of two syllables.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 75](sbe46025.htm)\n\n"
