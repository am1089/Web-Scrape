On account of seeing (i. e. thinking being attributed in the Upanishads to\nthe cause of the world; the pradhana) is not (to be identified with the cause\nindicated by the Upanishads; for) it is not founded on Scripture.\n\nIt is impossible to find room in the Vedanta-texts for the non-intelligent\npradhana, the fiction of the Sa _n_ khyas; because it is not founded on\nScripture. How so? Because the quality of seeing, i. e. thinking, is in\nScripture ascribed to the cause. For the passage, _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, (which\nbegins: 'Being only, my dear, this was in the beginning, one only, without a\nsecond,' and goes on, 'It thought (saw),\n\np. 48\n\nmay I be many, may I grow forth. It sent forth fire,') declares that this\nworld differentiated by name and form, which is there denoted by the word\n'this,' was before its origination identical with the Self of that which is\nand that the principle denoted by the term 'the being' (or 'that which is')\nsent forth fire and the other elements after having thought. The following\npassage also ('Verily in the beginning all this was Self, one only; there was\nnothing else blinking whatsoever. He thought, shall I send forth worlds? He\nsent forth these worlds,' Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4, 1, 2) declares the creation to have\nhad thought for its antecedent. In another passage also (Pr. Up. VI, 3) it is\nsaid of the person of sixteen parts, 'He thought, &c. He sent forth Pra _n_\na.' By 'seeing' (i.e. the verb 'seeing' exhibited in the Sutra) is not meant\nthat particular verb only, but any verbs which have a cognate sense; just as\nthe verb 'to sacrifice' is used to denote any kind of offering. Therefore\nother passages also whose purport it is to intimate that an all-knowing Lord\nis the cause of the world are to be quoted here, as, for instance, Mu. Up.\nI,.1, 9, 'From him who perceives all and who knows all, whose brooding\nconsists of knowledge, from him is born that Brahman, name and form and food.'\n\nThe argumentation of the Sa _n_ khyas that the pradhana may be called all-\nknowing on account of knowledge constituting an attribute of the gu _n_ a\nGoodness is inadmissible. For as in the pradhana-condition the three gu _n_ as\nare in a state of equipoise, knowledge which is a quality of Goodness only is\nnot possible 1. Nor can we admit the explanation that the pradhana is all-\nknowing because endowed with the capacity for all knowledge. For if, in the\ncondition of equipoise of the gu _n_ as, we term the pradhana all-knowing with\nreference to the power of knowledge residing in Goodness, we must likewise\nterm it little-knowing, with reference to the power impeding knowledge which\nresides in Passion and Darkness.\n\np. 49\n\n[paragraph continues] Moreover a modification of Goodness which is not\nconnected with a witnessing (observing) principle (sakshin) is not called\nknowledge, and the non-intelligent pradhana is destitute of such a principle.\nIt is therefore impossible to ascribe to the pradhana all-knowingness. The\ncase of the Yogins finally does not apply to the point under consideration;\nfor as they possess intelligence, they may, owing to an excess of Goodness in\ntheir nature, rise to omniscience 1.--Well then (say those Sa _n_ khyas who\nbelieve in the existence of a Lord) let us assume that the pradhana possesses\nthe quality of knowledge owing to the witnessing principle (the Lord), just as\nthe quality of burning is imparted to an iron ball by fire.--No, we reply; for\nif this were so, it would be more reasonable to assume that that which is the\ncause of the pradhana having the quality of thought i.e. the all-knowing\nprimary Brahman itself is the cause of the world.\n\nThe objection that to Brahman also all-knowingness in its primary sense cannot\nbe ascribed because, if the activity of cognition were permanent, Brahman\ncould not be considered as independent with regard to it, we refute as\nfollows. In what way, we ask the Sa _n_ khya, is Brahman's all-knowingness\ninterfered with by a permanent cognitional activity? To maintain that he, who\npossesses eternal knowledge capable to throw light on all objects, is not all-\nknowing, is contradictory. If his knowledge were considered non-permanent, he\nwould know sometimes, and sometimes he would not know; from which it would\nfollow indeed that he is not all-knowing. This fault is however avoided if we\nadmit Brahman's knowledge to be permanent.--But, it may be objected, on this\nlatter alternative the knower cannot be designated as independent with\nreference to the act of knowing.--Why not? we reply; the sun also, although\nhis heat and light are permanent, is nevertheless designated as independent\n\np. 50\n\nwhen we say, 'he burns, he gives light 1.'--But, it will again be objected, we\nsay that the sun burns or gives light when he stands in relation to some\nobject to be heated or illuminated; Brahman, on the other hand, stands, before\nthe creation of the world, in no relation to any object of knowledge. The\ncases are therefore not parallel.--This objection too, we reply, is not valid;\nfor as a matter of fact we speak of the Sun as an agent, saying 'the sun\nshines' even without reference to any object illuminated by him, and hence\nBrahman also may be spoken of as an agent, in such passages as 'it thought,'\n&c., even without reference to any object of knowledge. If, however, an object\nis supposed to be required ('knowing' being a transitive verb while 'shining'\nis intransitive), the texts ascribing thought to Brahman will fit all the\nbetter.--What then is that object to which the knowledge of the Lord can refer\npreviously to the origin of the world?--Name and form, we reply, which can be\ndefined neither as being identical with Brahman nor as different from it,\nunevolved but about to be evolved. For if, as the adherents of the Yoga- _s_\nastra assume, the Yogins have a perceptive knowledge of the past and the\nfuture through the favour of the Lord; in what terms shall we have to speak of\nthe eternal cognition of the ever pure Lord himself, whose objects are the\ncreation, subsistence, and dissolution of the world! The objection that\nBrahman, previously to the origin of the world, is not able to think because\nit is not connected with a body, &c. does not apply; for Brahman, whose nature\nis eternal cognition--as the sun's nature is eternal luminousness--\n\np. 51\n\ncan impossibly stand in need of any instruments of knowledge. The\ntransmigrating soul (sa _m_ sarin) indeed, which is under the sway of\nNescience, &c., may require a body in order that knowledge may arise in it;\nbut not so the Lord, who is free from all impediments of knowledge. The two\nfollowing Mantras also declare that the Lord does not require a body, and that\nhis knowledge is without any obstructions. 'There is no effect and no\ninstrument known of him, no one is seen like unto him or better; his high\npower is revealed as manifold, as inherent, acting as knowledge and force.'\n'Grasping without hands, hasting without feet, he sees without eyes, he hears\nwithout ears. He knows what can be known, but no one knows him; they call him\nthe first, the great person' ( _S_ v. Up. VI, 8; III, 19).\n\nBut, to raise a new objection, there exists no transmigrating soul different\nfrom the Lord and obstructed by impediments of knowledge; for _S_ ruti\nexpressly declares that 'there is no other seer but he; there is no other\nknower but he' (B _ri_. Up. Ill, 7, 23). How then can it be said that the\norigination of knowledge in the transmigrating soul depends on a body, while\nit does not do so in the case of the Lord?--True, we reply. There is in\nreality no transmigrating soul different from the Lord. Still the connexion\n(of the Lord) with limiting adjuncts, consisting of bodies and so on, is\nassumed, just as we assume the ether to enter into connexion with divers\nlimiting adjuncts such as jars, pots, caves, and the like. And just as in\nconsequence of connexion of the latter kind such conceptions and terms as 'the\nhollow (space) of a jar,' &c. are generally current, although the space inside\na jar is not really different from universal space, and just as in consequence\nthereof there generally prevails the false notion that there are different\nspaces such as the space of a jar and so on; so there prevails likewise the\nfalse notion that the Lord and the transmigrating soul are different; a notion\ndue to the non-discrimination of the (unreal) connexion of the soul with the\nlimiting conditions, consisting of the body and so on. That the Self, although\nin reality the only existence, imparts the quality of Selfhood to bodies and\nthe like\n\np. 52\n\nwhich are Not-Self is a matter of observation, and is due to mere wrong\nconception, which depends in its turn on antecedent wrong conception. And the\nconsequence of the soul thus involving itself in the transmigratory state is\nthat its thought depends on a body and the like.\n\nThe averment that the pradhana, because consisting of several elements, can,\nlike clay and similar substances, occupy the place of a cause while the\nuncompounded Brahman cannot do so, is refuted by the fact of the pradhana not\nbasing on Scripture. That, moreover, it is possible to establish by\nargumentation the causality of Brahman, but not of the pradhana and similar\nprinciples, the Sutrakara will set forth in the second Adhyaya (II, I, 4,\n&c.).\n\nHere the Sa _n_ khya comes forward with a new objection. The difficulty stated\nby you, he says, viz. that the non-intelligent pradhana cannot be the cause of\nthe world, because thought is ascribed to the latter in the sacred texts, can\nbe got over in another way also, viz. on the ground that non-intelligent\nthings are sometimes figuratively spoken of as intelligent beings. We observe,\nfor instance, that people say of a river-bank about to fall, 'the bank is\ninclined to fall (pipatishati),' and thus speak of a non-intelligent bank as\nif it possessed intelligence. So the pradhana also, although non-intelligent,\nmay, when about to create, be figuratively spoken of as thinking. Just as in\nordinary life some intelligent person after having bathed, and dined, and\nformed the purpose of driving in the afternoon to his village, necessarily\nacts according to his purpose, so the pradhana also acts by the necessity of\nits own nature, when transforming itself into the so-called great principle\nand the subsequent forms of evolution; it may therefore figuratively be spoken\nof as intelligent.--But what reason have you for setting aside the primary\nmeaning of the word 'thought' and for taking it in a figurative sense?--The\nobservation, the Sa _n_ khya replies, that fire and water also are\nfiguratively spoken of as intelligent beings in the two following scriptural\npassages, 'That fire thought; that water thought' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 3; 4). We\ntherefrom conclude that thought is to be taken in a figurative sense there\n\np. 53\n\nalso where Being (Sat) is the agent, because it is mentioned in a chapter\nwhere (thought) is generally taken in a figurative sense 1.\n\nTo this argumentation of the Sa _n_ khya the next Sutra replies:\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[48:1](sbe34011.htm#fr_95) Knowledge can arise only where Goodness is\npredominant, not where the three qualities mutually counterbalance one\nanother.\n\n[49:1](sbe34011.htm#fr_96) The excess of Sattva in the Yogin would not enable\nhim to rise to omniscience if he did not possess an intelligent principle\nindependent of Sattva.\n\n[50:1](sbe34011.htm#fr_97) \xc3\x82nanda Giri comments as follows: paroktanupapattim\nnirasitum p _rikkh_ ati idam iti.

Up. 'aikshata' is twice used in a figurative sense (with\nregard to fire and water); it is therefore to be understood figuratively in\nthe third passage also where it occurs.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 6](sbe34012.htm)\n\n"
