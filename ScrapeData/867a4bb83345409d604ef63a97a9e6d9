Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! I will now narrate the supreme glories of\nthe Devi and the anecdote how Manu, the son of Anga, obtained excellent\nkingdom by worshipping the Devi Bhagavati. The son of the king Anga, named\nChak _s_ u _s_ a became the Sixth Manu. One day he went to the Brahmar _s_ i\nPulaha Ri _s_ i and taking his refuge said :-- O Brahmar _s_ i! Thou removest\nall the sorrows and afflictions of those that come under Thy refuge; I now\ntake Thy refuge. Kindly advise Thy servant how he may become the Lord of an\nendless amount of wealth. O Muni! What can I do so that I may get the sole\nundisputed sway over the world? How my arms can wield the weapons and\nmanipulate them so that they may not be baffled? How my race and line be\nconstant and my youth remain ever the same, undecayed? And how can I, in the\nend, attain Mukti? O Muni! Kindly dost Thou give instructions to me on these\npoints and oblige. Hearing thus, the Muni wanted him to worship the Devi and\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O King! Listen attentively to what I say you today. Worship today\nthe all auspicious S'akti; by Her grace, all your desires will be fulfilled.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n8\\. Chak _s_ u _s_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! What is that very holy worship of S\xc2\x92ri\nBhagavati? How to do it? Kindly describe all these in detail.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9-20. The Muni said :-- O King! I will now disclose all about the excellent\nPuja of the Devi Bhagavati. Hear. You recite (mentally) always the seed mantra\nof Vakbhava (Speech) (The Deity being Maha Sarasvati). If any one makes japam\n(recites slowly) of the Vakbhava Vija thrice a day, one gets both the highest\nenjoyment here and, in the end, release (Mukti). O Son of a K _s_ attriya!\nThere is no other Vija Mantra (word) better than this of Vak (the Word).\nThrough the Japam of this Vija Mantra comes the increase of strength and\nprowess and all successes. By the Japam of this, Brahma is so powerful and has\nbecome the Creator; Vi _sn_ u preserves the Universe and Mahes'vara has become\nthe Destroyer of the Universe. The other Dikpalas (the Regents of the\nquarters) and the other Siddhas have become very powerful by the power of this\nMantra, and are capable of favouring or disfavouring others. So, O King! You,\ntoo, worship the Devi of the Devas, the World Mother and ere long you will\nbecome the Lord of unbounded wealth. There is no doubt in\n\n\n\np. 1036\n\n\n\nthis. O Narada! Thus advised by Pulaha Ri _s_ i, the son of the King Anga went\nto the banks of the Viraja river to practise austerities. There the king Chak\n_s_ u _s_ a remained absorbed in making Japam of the Vakbhava Vija Mantra and\ntook for his food the leaves of the trees that dropped on the ground and thus\npractised severe austerities.\n\n\n\nThe first year he ate leaves; the second year he drank water and in the third\nyear he sustained his life by breathing air simply and thus remained steady\nlike a pillar. Thus he remained without food for twelve years. He went on\nmaking Japam of the Vakbhava Mantra and his heart and mind became purified.\nWhile he was sitting alone, absorbed in the meditation of the Devi Mantra,\nthere appeared before him suddenly the Parames'vari, the World Mother, the\nIncarnate of Lak _s_ mi. The Highest Deity, full of dauntless fire and the\nEmbodiment of all the Devas, spoke graciously in sweet words to Chak _s_ u _s_\na, the son of Anga.\n\n\n\n21-29. O Regent of the earth! I am pleased with your Tapasya. Now ask any boon\nthat you want. I will give that to you. Chak _s_ u _s_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Thou,\nworshipped by the Devas! O Sovereign of the Deva of the Devas! Thou art the\nController Inside; Thou art the Controller Outside. Thou knowest everything\nwhat I desire in my mind. Still, O Devi! When I am so fortunate as to see\nThee, I say Thou grantest me the kingdom for the Manvantara period.\xc2\x94 The Devi\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O Best of the K _s_ attriyas! I grant unto you the kingdom of the\nwhole world for one manvantara. You will have many sons, very powerful,\nindeed, and well qualified. Your kingdom will be free from any danger till at\nlast you will certainly get Mukti.\xc2\x94 Thus granting the excellent boon to Manu,\nShe disappeared then and there, after being praised by Manu, with deep\ndevotion. The Sixth Manu, then favoured by the Devi, enjoyed the sovereignty\nof the earth and other pleasures and became the best of the Manus. His sons\nbecame the devotees of the Devi, very powerful and expert and became respected\nby all and enjoyed the pleasures of the kingdom. Thus getting the supremacy by\nthe worship of the Devi, the Chak _s_ u _s_ a Manu became merged in the end in\nthe Holy Feet of the Devi.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Ninth Chapter of the Tenth Book on the narrative of Chak _s_ u\n_s_ a Manu in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk10ch10.htm)\n\n"
