I will keep  \nMy watch while Rama lies asleep:  \nFor in the whole wide world is none  \nDearer to me than Raghu's son.  \nHarbour no doubt or jealous fear:  \nI speak the truth with heart sincere:  \nFor from the grace which he has shown  \nWill glory on my name be thrown:  \nGreat store of merit shall I gain,  \nAnd duteous, form no wish in vain.  \nLet me enforced by many a row  \nOf followers, armed with shaft and bow  \nFor well-loved Rama's weal provide  \nWho lies asleep by Sita's side.  \nFor through this wood I often go,  \nAnd all its shades conceal I know:  \nAnd we with conquering arms can meet  \nA four-fold host arrayed complete.'  \nWith words like these I spoke, designed  \nTo move the high-souled Bharat's mind,  \nBut he upon his duty bent,  \nPlied his persuasive argument:  \n'O, how can slumber close mine eyes  \nWhen lowly couched with Sita lies  \nThe royal Rama? can I give  \nMy heart to joy, or even live?  \nHe whom no mighty demon, no,  \nNor heavenly God can overthrow,  \nSee, Guha, how he lies, alas,  \n\np. 194  \n\nWith Sita couched on gathered grass.  \nBy varied labours, long, severe,  \nBy many a prayer and rite austere,  \nHe, Das'aratha's cherished son,  \nBy Fortune stamped, from Heaven was won.  \nNow as his son is forced to fly,  \nThe king ere long will surely die:  \nReft of his guardian hand, forlorn  \nIn widowed grief this land will mourn,  \nE'en now perhaps, with toil o'erspent,  \nThe women cease their loud lament,  \nAnd cries of woe no longer ring  \nThroughout the palace of the king.  \nBut ah for sad Kaus'alya! how  \nFare she and mine own mothef now?  \nHow fares the king? this night, I think,  \nSome of the three in death will sink.  \nWith hopes upon S'atrughna set  \nMy mother may survive as yet,  \nBut the sad queen will die who bore  \nThe hero, for her grief is sore.  \nHis cherished wish that would have made  \nDear Rama king, so long delayed,  \n'Too late! too late!' the king will cry,  \nAnd conquered by his misery die.  \nWhen Fate has brought the mournful day  \nWhich sees my father pass away,  \nHow happy in their lives are they  \nAllowed his funeral rites to pay.  \nOur exile o'er, with him who ne'er  \nTurns from the oath his lips may swear,  \nMay we returning safe and well  \nAgain in fair Ayodhya dwell.'  \nThus Bharat stood with many a sigh  \nLamenting, and the night went by.  \nSoon as the morning light shone fair  \nIn votive coils both bound their hair.  \nAnd then I sent them safely o'er  \nAnd left them on the farther shore.  \nWith Sita then they onward passed,  \nTheir coats of bark about them cast,  \n   Their locks like hermits' bound,  \nThe mighty tamers of the foe,  \nEach with his arrows and his bow,  \nWent over the rugged ground,  \nProud in their strength and undeterred  \nLike elephants that lead the herd,  \nAnd gazing oft around.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXXVII.: Guha's Story.](ry165.htm)\n\n"
