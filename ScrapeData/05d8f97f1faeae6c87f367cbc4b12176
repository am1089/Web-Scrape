For that heart there are five gates belonging to the Devas (the senses).\nThe eastern gate is the Pra _n_ a (up-breathing), that is the eye, that is\n\xc3\x82ditya (the sun). Let a man meditate on that as brightness (glory of\ncountenance) and health. He who knows this, becomes bright and healthy.\n\n2\\. The southern gate is the Vyana (back-breathing), that is the ear, that is\nthe moon. Let a man meditate on that as happiness and fame. He who knows this,\nbecomes happy and famous.\n\n3\\. The western gate is the Apana (down-breathing), that is speech, that is\nAgni (fire). Let a man meditate on that as glory of countenance and health. He\nwho knows this, becomes glorious and healthy.\n\n4\\. The northern gate is the Samana (on-breathing), that is mind, that is Par\n_g_ anya (rain). Let a man meditate on that as celebrity and beauty.\n\np. 47\n\n[paragraph continues] He who knows this, becomes celebrated and beautiful.\n\n5\\. The upper gate is the Udana (out-breathing), that is air, that is ether.\nLet a man meditate on that as strength and greatness. He who knows this,\nbecomes strong and great.\n\n6\\. These are the five men of Brahman, the doorkeepers of the Svarga (heaven)\nworld. He who knows these five men of Brahman, the door-keepers of the Svarga\nworld, in his family a strong son is born. He who thus knows these five men of\nBrahman, as the door-keepers of the Svarga world, enters himself the Svarga\nworld.\n\n7\\. Now that light which shines above this heaven, higher than all, higher\nthan everything, in the highest world, beyond which there are no other worlds,\nthat is the same light which is within man. And of this we have this visible\nproof 1:\n\n8\\. Namely, when we thus perceive by touch the warmth here in the body 2. And\nof it we have this audible proof: Namely, when we thus, after stopping our\nears, listen to what is like the rolling of a carriage, or the bellowing of an\nox, or the sound of a burning fire 3 (within the ears). Let a man meditate on\nthis as the (Brahman) which is seen and heard.\n\np. 48\n\n[paragraph continues] He, who knows this, becomes conspicuous and celebrated,\nyea, he becomes celebrated.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[46:1](sbe01071.htm#fr_176) The meditation on the five gates and the five\ngate-keepers of the heart is meant to be subservient to the meditation on\nBrahman, as the ether in the heart, which, as it is said at the end, is\nactually seen and heard by the senses as being within the heart.\n\n[47:1](sbe01071.htm#fr_177) The presence of Brahman in the heart of man is not\nto rest on the testimony of revelation only, but is here to be established by\nthe evidence of the senses. Childish as the argument may seem to us, it shows\nat all events how intently the old Brahmans thought on the problem of the\nevidence of the invisible.\n\n[47:2](sbe01071.htm#fr_178) That warmth must come from something, just as\nsmoke comes from fire, and this something is supposed to be Brahman in the\nheart.\n\n[47:3](sbe01071.htm#fr_179) Cf. Ait. \xc3\x82r. III, 2, 4, 11-13.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 14](sbe01072.htm)\n\n'
