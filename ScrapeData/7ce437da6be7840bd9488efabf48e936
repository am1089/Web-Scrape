THE PLAINT.\n\n1. 1 The claimant, after having produced a pledge the value of which has been well ascertained, shall cause the plaint to be written. (He must have been impelled) to proffer his claim, by the nature of the claim, and must be intent on promoting the victory of his cause.\n\n* 2. 2 The defendant (creditor), immediately after having become acquainted with the tenour of the plaint, shall write down his answer, which must correspond to the tenour of the plaint.\n\n* 3. 3 Or let him (the defendant) deliver his answer on the next day, or three days, or seven days later.\n\np. 25\n\n[paragraph continues] The plaintiff no doubt duly obtains his victory at once,\nwhen the trial has reached the third stage (the examination of the evidence).\n\n* 4. 4 An answer is fourfold; a denial, a confession, a special plea, and that which is based on a plea of former judgment.\n\n* 5. A denial is fourfold (being couched in any one out of the four forms hereafter mentioned). 'This is false,' or 'I do not know anything about it,' or 'I was not present at the transaction,' or 'I was not in existence at the time when this event took place.'\n\n6. 6 A contradiction, the reverse, a retort, and a friendly counsel; in one out of these four forms should the answer be given, and it should be in conformity with the tenour of the plaint.\n\n* 7. 7 Before the answer to the plaint has been tendered by the defendant, the plaintiff may amend his own statements as much as he desires.\n\np. 26\n\n* 8. 8 These are called the defects of a plaint: (1) if it relates to a different subject; (2) if it is unmeaning; (3) if the amount (of the sum claimed) has not been properly stated; (4) if it is wanting in propriety; (5) if the writing is deficient; (6) or redundant; (7) if it has been damaged.\n\n9. 9 By whomsoever a claim is raised, whatever and from whomsoever it may have been claimed: from that very person must the claimant receive that very thing, and it must not be (claimed) mutually, or (claimed) from a stranger. Thus 'a claim relating to a different subject' may be of three kinds.\n\n10. 10 Thy friend here has thought in his mind, that I am his enemy. On account of this great intolerance I have impeached thee here.\n\n11. 11 If he omits to state the amount of the thing (claimed), and forgets to aim at brevity(?): this fault of a plaint is called omission of the amount (claimed), and it should be avoided.\n\n12\\. Let him avoid improper statements in the plaint (e.g. an accusation which\nis raised) by a plurality of persons against one single-handed; or\n\np. 27\n\n[paragraph continues] (a cause which) is opposed to (the interests of) the\ncity or kingdom (in which he lives).\n\n13\\. A plaint in which a mere dot is omitted, or where a word or a syllable\nhas been obliterated, or where too little or too much has been written, or\nwhich is absurd; such a plaint should be carefully avoided.\n\n14\\. He should (equally) avoid a plaint which has been destroyed or damaged\n(by an accident), or which has been soiled by water, oil, or other (liquids),\neven though the purport and meaning of the plaint be quite plain.\n\n* 15. A plaint, though otherwise established, is not correct, if it is contrary to established law and usage.\n\n16\\. A claim which is proffered in this form\xc2\x97'I gave this to him while he was\nin a state of intoxication with fragrance (through a smell of perfume)'\xc2\x97cannot\nsucceed, because it is contrary to established usage.\n\n* 17. 17 Where different words are (subsequently) inserted (in the plaint), and where the sense becomes different (in consequence), there the judicial investigation becomes confused, and the evidence itself is thrown into confusion.\n\n* 18. 18 When the claimant, in a passion, and actuated\n\np. 28\n\nby one of the immoral motives, such as partiality, makes some special\nstatement, it shall at once be completely reduced to writing on a board or\nother (writing material).\n\n19\\. Other statements than those (taken down at first)regarding the plaintiff\non a board or other (writing material) shall be removed, after careful\nconsideration, by persons versed in law, (when reporting on the trial) for the\ninformation of the king's judge.\n\n20. 20 Let such persons reduce to writing the statements of each party, and whatever else has been written on the board, together with the names of the\n\np. 29\n\nwitnesses, as well as those statements in which both parties concur.\n\n21. 21 Additional statements of the plaintiff (or defendant), which are not contained in the writings of both parties, shall be (subsequently) entered into his (their) declaration. They are called Pratyakalita ('what is interposed').\n\n* 22. 22 If one deputed by the claimant, or chosen as his representative by the defendant, speaks for his client in court, the victory or defeat concerns the party (himself and not the representative).\n\n* 23. 23 He deserves punishment who speaks in behalf of another, without being either the brother, the father, the son, or the appointed agent; and so does he who contradicts himself at the trial.\n\n* 24. 24 He who forsakes his original claim and produces a new one, loses his suit, because he confounds two plaints with one another.\n\n* 25. 25 A verbal error does not annul the claim in\n\np. 30\n\nactions of any kind. So if the case relates to cattle, or to a woman, or to\nland, or to a debt, he is liable to punishment, but his claim is not annulled.\n\n26. 26 Where the defendant denies the charge, the claimant has to prove his accusation, unless the denial should have been in the form called Pratyavaskandana.\n\n* 27. 27 What the claimant has fully declared word for word in the plaint that he must substantiate by adducing evidence at the third stage of the trial.\n\n* 28. Proof is said to be of two kinds, human and divine. Human proof consists of documentary and oral evidence. By divine proof is meant the ordeal by balance and the other (modes of divine test).\n\n29. 29 Where a transaction has taken place by day,\n\np. 31\n\nin a village or town, or in the presence of witnesses, divine test is not\napplicable.\n\n* 30. 30 Divine test is applicable (where the transaction has taken place) in a solitary forest, at night, or in the interior of a house, and in cases of violence, or of denial of a deposit.\n\n31. 31 Where the defendant has evaded the plaint by means of a special plea, it becomes incumbent on him to prove his assertion, and he is placed in the position of a claimant.\n\n* 32. 32 One who takes to flight after having received the summons; one who remains silent; one who is convicted (of untruth) by (the deposition of) the witnesses; and one who makes a confession himself: these are the four kinds of Avasannas (losers of their suit).\n\n* 33. 33 One who alters his former statements; one\n\np. 32\n\nwho shuns the judicial investigation; one who does not make his appearance\n(before the tribunal); one who makes no reply; and one who absconds after\nreceiving the summons: these five kinds of persons are called Hina (cast in\ntheir present suit).\n\n34. 34 Precious stones, such as rubies, golden ornaments, such as Dinaras, pearls, coral, shells, and other (jewels and precious metals) shall be returned\n\np. 33\n\nto their owner, in case they turn out to be imitations only.\n\n35. 35 If a man seizes perfumes, or garlands\xc2\x97other than those which have been given to him\xc2\x97or ornaments, or clothes, or shoes, which belong to the king, he deserves to be corporally punished.\n\n* 36. 36 The price or value of a commodity, wages, a deposit, a fine, what has been abandoned (by one and found by another), what has been idly promised, and what has been won at play; none of these articles yields interest, except under a special agreement to the purpose.\n\n37. 37 Men of the _S_ udra caste, who proffer a false accusation against a member of a twice-born (Aryan) caste, shall have their tongue slit by (the officers of) the king, and he shall cause them to be put on stakes.\n\n38. 38 A royal edict, a (private) document, a written\n\np. 34\n\ntitle, a grant, a pledge, a (promise reduced to) writing, a sale, or purchase:\none who brings a claim in regard to any one of these before the king is known\nas defendant among those conversant with the rules (of legal pleading).\n\n* 39. 39 Where the deposition of the witnesses has been objected to, it becomes necessary first of all to clear the witnesses from suspicion. When the witnesses themselves have been cleared from suspicion, he may undertake to remove the doubts which have been raised against their deposition.\n\n* 40. 40 When a man has lost his cause through the dishonesty of witnesses or judges, the cause may be tried anew. When, however, a man has been cast through his own conduct, the trial cannot be renewed.\n\n41. 41 One convicted by his own confession, one\n\np. 35\n\ncast through his own conduct, and one whom the judicial investigation has\nproved to be in the wrong: (these three) deserve to have their final defeat\ndeclared at the hand of the judges.\n\n42. 42 Whenever the (false) assertions have been removed, the judges shall pass a decree. If they pass a judgment, before the false statements have been removed, they will cause evil in the next world and in this.\n\n43. 43 One condemned by the judges shall be punished by the king according to law. The victorious party shall receive a document recording his victory, and couched in appropriate language.\n\n44. 44 This has been formerly declared by the self-existent Being to be the mouth of a lawsuit. If the mouth of a lawsuit is in order, the whole suit is in order, but not otherwise.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[24:1](sbe3306.htm#fr_70) II, 1. The term suni _s_ _k_ itabaladhanas, which\nhas been taken to mean 'after having produced a pledge the value (or\ncompetence) of which has been well ascertained,' is by no means clear, and\nadmits of several different interpretations. Thus it might be rendered, 'after\nhaving carefully explored the nature of the wrong offered to him.' A. does not\nexplain this obscure term 'Impelled by the nature of his claim;' not by the\nking, or by an enemy, but merely by his own cause. 'Intent on promoting the\nvictory of his cause,' i.e. absolutely determined not to embark in any other\nundertaking, previous to having gained his cause. A.\n\n[24:2](sbe3306.htm#fr_71) The creditor is called plaintiff. The debtor is\ncalled defendant. The defendant, after having heard the tenour of the plaint\nwhich has been tendered in writing by the plaintiff, shall write an answer,\ni.e. make a reply, which corresponds to the tenour of the plaint. A. Read\npratyarthi in the text.\n\n[24:3](sbe3306.htm#fr_72) The defendant may tender his written answer on the\nnext day, or three days, or seven days after he has heard the accusation. The\nplaintiff, on the other hand, is not allowed any time to reply to the\nstatements of the defendant. His victory (or defeat) is p. 25 decided at once,\nby examining the proofs that have been adduced. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 7.\n\n[25:4](sbe3306.htm#fr_73) A special plea is when the defendant admits a fact,\nbut qualifies or explains it so as not to allow it to be matter of accusation.\nA plea of former judgment is when the defendant pleads that the very same\ncause has been previously tried at the tribunal of this or that judge, and\nthat his adversary has been cast. A.\n\n[25:6](sbe3306.htm#fr_74) This paragraph, says A., occurs in the original\nwork, and has therefore been inserted in this place, though it is difficult of\nexplanation and a mere paraphrase of the preceding paragraph. It has been\nrendered in accordance with his interpretation. 'The reverse' means\nconfession. 'A retort' means a special plea. 'A friendly counsel' means plea\nof former judgment. A.\n\n[25:7](sbe3306.htm#fr_75) The plaintiff may go on altering and improving his\nwritten declaration, till the defendant gives in his answer. When, however,\nthe plaint has been answered, he is no longer at liberty to make any further\namendments. A.\n\n[26:8](sbe3306.htm#fr_76) A. does not explain the rather obscure terms\noccurring in several of the following paragraphs. He confines himself to\nstating that they contain an accurate definition of the 'seven defects of a\nplaint,' as enumerated in paragraph 8, to which the defect described in\nparagraphs 55, 16 has to be added as an eighth.\n\n[26:9](sbe3306.htm#fr_77) The three kinds of 'a claim relating to a different\nsubject' appear, therefore, to be these: where it proceeds from a different\nperson than the creditor; where the amount of the sum claimed has not been\nstated correctly; and where the plaint has been addressed to a wrong person.\n\n[26:10](sbe3306.htm#fr_78) This is an instance of an unmeaning or frivolous\naccusation. A.\n\n[26:11](sbe3306.htm#fr_79) The reading of this paragraph is uncertain.\n\n[27:17](sbe3306.htm#fr_80) A. illustrates this rule by the following example.\nThe claimant has claimed a certain sum. At the time of the trial he names a\nlarger sum than he did before. Thus the judicial investigation becomes\nconfused.\n\n[27:18](sbe3306.htm#fr_81) If a man actuated by one of the three passions,\nsexual desire, wrath, and covetousness, mentions some special (important)\ncircumstance at the trial, the scribe shall enter it at once in writing on a\nboard, or leaf, or Bhur _g_ a-bark, or box, or wall. A. This rule seems to\nrelate to incidental statements, which escape one of the parties through\ninadvertency. Thus in the well-known drama M _ri_ _k_ _kh_ aka _t_ ika, the\nwicked prince Sa _m_ sthanaka, when informing the p. 28 judge that Vasantasena\nhas been murdered, adds, 'not by myself.' The judge pounces upon the latter\nstatement, suspicious as it looks, and causes the scribe to put it down in\nwriting on the floor. The prince, perceiving that he has committed himself,\neffaces the writing with his foot. The custom of writing the statements of the\nparties on the floor is repeatedly referred to in the Indian dramas. From what\nB _ri_ haspati says, it would seem that in the time of this law-writer the\nstatements of the parties had first to be written on a board, and then on a\nleaf, after all the required corrections had been entered. Narada seems to\nrefer to the same custom in paragraphs 19 and 20.\n\nAccording to Dr. Burnell, the boards referred to in the law-books must have\nbeen a sort of black wooden boards. See Burnell, South Indian Palaeography,\n2nd ed., p. 87.\n\n[28:20](sbe3306.htm#fr_82) In translating this paragraph, the obscurity of\nwhich is only surpassed by the preceding paragraph, I have deviated from the\ninterpretation proposed by the commentator.\n\nA. takes this paragraph as containing four independent clauses: 1. what has\nbeen stated or admitted by both parties; 2. whatever else has been written on\nthe board; 3. the depositions of the witnesses; 4. what each party has\nconceded to the other. These four things should be reduced to writing by the\npersons entrusted with the judicial investigation. 'Whatever else has been\nwritten on the board,' i.e. whatever the plaintiff amends or adds, while the\nplaint is being reduced to writing. Such statements, as shown in the next\nparagraph, are called Pratyakalita.\n\n[29:21](sbe3306.htm#fr_83) A. infers from the use of the term 'both parties'\nthat a Pratyakalita statement may proceed from the defendant as well as from\nthe plaintiff, though the plaintiff alone is specially mentioned. A. adds that\nthis rule applies equally to all those kinds of statements, which are\nmentioned in paragraph 20.\n\n[29:22](sbe3306.htm#fr_84) This rule applies equally where a party is\nprevented from appearing before the court by illness, and where the party is\nnot a good speaker, and has appointed an agent or attorney for that reason. A.\n\n[29:23](sbe3306.htm#fr_85) This prohibition relates to those who, from love,\nanger, or avarice, meddle with the affairs of strangers, and pretend to act in\ntheir behalf at court. A.\n\n[29:24](sbe3306.htm#fr_86) If a claimant, on finding himself unable to prove\nhis claim at the trial, proffers a different claim, he must be pronounced the\nlosing party, on account of the confusion caused by him. A.\n\n[29:25](sbe3306.htm#fr_87) An erroneous statement does not necessarily cause\nthe defeat p. 30 of the plaintiff. This is particularly the case in one of the\nfollowing important actions: a case relating to a cow, female buffalo, or\nother cattle; a case relating to a woman; a case relating to landed property,\ni.e. a house, field, &c.; and a case relating to one of the twenty-five\nsubdivisions of the law of debt. In any case he is not defeated, merely on\naccount of an erroneous statement contained in the suit. He does not lose the\nsuit instituted by him, though he is liable to punishment. A. The Mitakshara\n(p. 23) has a long gloss on this rule of Narada, from which it appears that\nthe 'erroneous statements' here referred to are statements made through\ninadvertency, and that this rule applies to civil, as opposed to criminal\nactions. Read vak _kh_ ale in the Sanskrit text.\n\n[30:26](sbe3306.htm#fr_88) An answer in the form called Pratyavaskandana is\nwhere the defendant admits the facts adduced by the plaintiff, but explains\nthem so as not to be matter of accusation.\n\n[30:27](sbe3306.htm#fr_89) The claimant must prove, at the judicial\ninvestigation, whatever he has committed to writing in the plaint. A.\n\n[30:29](sbe3306.htm#fr_90) The divers kinds of divine test will be declared\nbelow. In the case of all those transactions which take place during day-time\neye- and ear-witnesses are present. Documentary evidence, likewise, is\ngenerally available in such cases. Therefore, divine proof should not be\nresorted to. Where a transaction is known to have p. 31 taken place in the\npresence of witnesses, divine proof is also not applicable. A.\n\n[31:30](sbe3306.htm#fr_91) In all the places and occasions mentioned in this\nparagraph human proof is not applicable, wherefore divine test has to be\nresorted to. A.\n\n[31:31](sbe3306.htm#fr_92) Where the defendant has recourse to the mode of\ndefence called Pratyavaskandana, i.e. where he admits the charge, but adduces\na special circumstance to exonerate himself, the plaint becomes purposeless.\nTo the defendant, however, belongs the onus probandi in regard to the special\ncircumstance mentioned by him. He is, therefore, reduced to the position of a\nclaimant, in that it is incumbent on him to prove his assertion at the time of\nthe judicial investigation (kriya). A.\n\n[31:32](sbe3306.htm#fr_93) One who, though summoned by the king's officers,\nabsconds through fear of the accusation brought against him; one who stands\nmute in the assembly when he is asked to make his declaration; one who is cast\nby the depositions of the witnesses; and one who confesses to be in the wrong\nhimself: these four persons are non-suited. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 16; Manu\nVIII, 55-58.\n\n[31:33](sbe3306.htm#fr_94) Two out of the four 'losers of their suit,' who are\nreferred p. 32 to in the preceding paragraph, may be said to have lost their\ncause for once and all, viz. one who is convicted of untruth by the deposition\nof the witnesses, and one who confesses his wrong himself. The two others,\nviz. one who remains silent and one who absconds, are liable to punishment,\nbut they do not entirely lose their suit, as their cause may be tried anew.\nSimilarly, the five persons mentioned in par. 33, though non-suited in the\ncase in hand, may have their cause tried anew. 'One who alters his\nstatements,' i.e. one who, from forgetfulness, says something different from\nwhat he had stated before. 'One who shuns the judicial investigation,' i.e.\none who, from repugnance against judicial investigation, throws the\nproceedings into confusion. 'One who does not make his appearance before the\ntribunal,' i.e. on account of a calamity which has befallen him through the\nking or through fate, &c. 'One who makes no reply,' i.e. one who does not give\nin his answer at once, and asks for delay to prepare it. 'One who absconds'\nfrom fear of an enemy. A. This interpretation has evidently been called forth\nby a desire to reconcile par. 33 with the preceding paragraph, as the persons\ncalled Hina are partly identical with those designed as Avasannas. It may be\ndoubted, however, whether par. 32 belongs to the original work of Narada, as\nthe identical rule is elsewhere attributed to B _ri_ haspati (see Viram., p.\n102), and as it is certainly difficult to reconcile the two paragraphs with\none another.\n\n[32:34](sbe3306.htm#fr_95) If the owner of the articles mentioned in this rule\nsells them for genuine, and the purchaser, putting belief in his statements,\naccepts them as such, and pays for them, but finds out afterwards that they\nare not genuine, the seller must take them back, and must give other articles\nin exchange for them which are really valuable, or he must make good their\nvalue to the purchaser. A. As for the meaning of the term Dinara, which\ncorresponds to the Latin denarius, see the Introduction.\n\n[33:35](sbe3306.htm#fr_96) One who, from pride, seizes (or uses) one of the\nabove articles, shall be corporally punished, if they belong to the king. A.\nThe reading of this paragraph is quite uncertain.\n\n[33:36](sbe3306.htm#fr_97) 'The price of a commodity,' the price paid for a\nsaleable commodity which has been sold. 'A deposit,' a trust. 'A fine,' an\namercement which has been inflicted by the king's judges. 'What has been\nabandoned,' what has been seized after its dereliction (by the original\nowner). 'What has been idly promised' to bards or other worthless persons.\n\n[33:37](sbe3306.htm#fr_98) If the _S_ udras, by whom this crime has been\ncommitted, are punished by the king, he becomes free from blame. Otherwise,\nthe blame falls on him, as it is his duty to reward the honest, and to punish\nevil-doers. A.\n\n[33:38](sbe3306.htm#fr_99) The divers forms in which a plaint is instituted in\neach of these several cases (excepting a single case, a transaction of sale)\nare stated as follows by A.: '1. This man has not taken notice of a certain\nroyal edict. 2. This man has (unduly) availed himself of a certain document\nrelating to its owner. 3. This man, by virtue of a certain written title, has\nappropriated a slave girl belonging to p. 34 myself. 4. This man raises the\nrevenue of a certain village which has been granted to myself. The grant\nrelates to myself only. 5. This property has first been pledged tome by the\ndebtor. How can any one else enjoy it? 6. Why does not this man deliver this\nchattel to me, which has been promised to me in writing? 7. I have purchased\nthis commodity from him, and paid for it. He does not make the commodity over\nto me.'\xc2\x97Read a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a.\n\n[34:39](sbe3306.htm#fr_100) Where the defendant raises groundless objections\nagainst the trustworthiness of the depositions of witnesses, he is liable to\npunishment, like one who shuns the judicial investigation, and loses his suit\nin consequence. After the witnesses have been cleared from suspicion, their\nstatements have to be examined in order to remove what looks suspicious in\nthem. A.\n\n[34:40](sbe3306.htm#fr_101) Those who have lost their cause, either through\nthe statements of their own witnesses, or through the decision of the judges,\nmay have their cause tried anew, according to a rule previously laid down. If,\nhowever, a man has been convicted by his own conduct, or if the witnesses\nadduced by him should turn out to have been corrupted by him, the case cannot\nagain be opened. A.\n\n[34:41](sbe3306.htm#fr_102) 1\\. One who pleads guilty; 2. one convicted by his\nown p. 35 conduct, as e.g. by adducing false witnesses or forged documents; 3.\none convicted by the witnesses: those three shall not be punished till they\nhave been condemned by the judges. A.\n\n[35:42](sbe3306.htm#fr_103) When the time for passing a decree has arrived,\nthe judges shall carefully remove all mere assertions of either party. Should\nthey omit to do so, they would be in danger of condemning an innocent man, and\nmight produce evil in this world by causing loss of money, and in the next\nworld by barring the way to paradise to themselves, as it is the duty of kings\nto restrain evil-doers and to protect the righteous. A.\n\n[35:43](sbe3306.htm#fr_104) According to B _ri_ haspati, the document of\nvictory which has to be given to the victorious party shall contain an\naccurate record of the plaint, of the answer, and of the judicial\ninvestigation.\n\n[35:44](sbe3306.htm#fr_105) The general rules regarding judicial proceedings,\nwhich have been laid down in the preceding section, are declared to be the\nmouth of a lawsuit, because they are applicable to the trial of every suit.\n'The self-existent Being,' i.e. Brahman.
