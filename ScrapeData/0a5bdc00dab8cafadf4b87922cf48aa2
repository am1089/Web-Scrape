Whilst this (offering to Pushan) is being performed, the horse,\nhaving been cleansed, is led up--being one which is marked with all colours,\nor which is perfect in speed, worth a thousand (cows), in its prime, and\nwithout its match under the right-side yoke 2.\n\np. 354\n\n13:4:2:22\\. And as to its being one marked with all colours, it is for the\nsake of his (the Sacrificer\'s) obtaining and securing everything, for colour\n(outward appearance) is everything, and the A _s_ vamedha is everything. And\nas to its being perfect in speed, it is for the sake of his obtaining and\nsecuring vigour, for speed is vigour. And as to its being worth a thousand\n(cows), it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing everything, for a\nthousand means everything, and the A _s_ vamedha is everything. And as to its\nbeing in its prime, it is for the sake of his obtaining unlimited vigour, for\nsuch a one that is in the prime (of youth) increases to unlimited vigour. And\nas to its being without its match under the right-side yoke, it is for the\nsake of his obtaining yonder (sun), for that (horse) indeed is he that shines\nyonder, and assuredly there is no one to rival him.\n\n13:4:2:33\\. As to this, Bhallaveya, however, said, \'That horse should be of\ntwo colours, black-spotted 1, for that (horse) was produced from Pra _g_\napati\'s eye, and this eye is of two colours, white and black: he thus endows\nit with its own colour.\'\n\n13:4:2:44\\. But Satyaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ i said, \'That horse should be of three\ncolours, its forepart black, its hindpart white, with a wain for its mark in\nfront;--when its forepart is black it is the same as this black of the eye;\nand when its hindpart is white it is the same as this white of the eye; and\nwhen it has a wain for its mark in front, that is the pupil: such\n\np. 355\n\na one, indeed, is perfect in colour 1.\' Whichever of these, then, should be\nready at hand, either a many-coloured one, or one of two colours, or one of\nthree colours with a wain for its mark, let him slaughter it: but in speed it\nshould certainly be perfect.\n\n13:4:2:55\\. In front (of the sacrificial ground) there are those keepers of it\nready at hand,--to wit, a hundred royal princes, clad in armour; a hundred\nwarriors armed with swords; a hundred sons of heralds and headmen, bearing\nquivers filled with arrows 2; and a hundred sons of attendants 3 and\ncharioteers, bearing staves;--and a hundred exhausted, worn out horses 4\namongst which, having let loose that (sacrificial horse), they guard it.\n\n13:4:2:66\\. He then prepares an (ish _t_ i) offering to Savit _ri_  5\\--a cake\non twelve potsherds to Savit _ri_ Prasavit _ri_ \\--thinking, May Savit _ri_\nimpel this my sacrifice!\' for Savit _ri_ (the sun), indeed, is the impeller\n(prasavit _ri_ ).\n\n13:4:2:77\\. For this (offering) there are fifteen kindling-verses;\n\np. 356\n\nand the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of V _ri_ tra 1. [The\nverses, _Ri_ g-veda V, 82, 9; VII, 45, 1], \'He who calleth forth all these\nbeings (with his call, may he, Savit _ri_ , quicken us)!\' and \'May the divine\nSavit _ri_ come hither, treasure-laden, (filling the air whilst driving with\nhis steeds; holding in his hand many things meet for man; and laying to rest\nand awakening the world),\' pronounced in a low voice, are the invitatory and\noffering formulas of the chief oblation. Those of the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t are\ntwo vira _g_ -verses 2. The priests\' fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains):\nthe meaning of this has been explained.\n\n13:4:2:88\\. Whilst the fore-offerings of this (ish _t_ i) are being performed,\na Brahman lute-player, striking up the uttaramandra (tune 3), sings three\nstrophes composed by himself (on topics 4 such as), \'Such a sacrifice he\noffered,--Such gifts he gave:\' the meaning of this has been explained 5.\n\n13:4:2:99\\. He then prepares a second (offering)--a cake on twelve potsherds\nto Savit _ri_ \xc3\x82savit _ri_ \\--thinking, \'May Savit _ri_ propel this my\nsacrifice!\' for Savit _ri_ , indeed, is the propeller (asavit _ri_ ).\n\np. 357\n\n13:4:2:1010\\. For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses; and the\ntwo butter-portions are possessed of that which is 1: the (truly) existent he\nthereby obtains. [The verses, _Ri_ g-veda V, 82, 5; VII, 45, 31 \'All troubles,\nO divine Savit _ri_ , (keep from us, do thou send us that which is good)!\' and\n\'May that mighty god Savit _ri_ (the lord of treasure, send us treasure;\nshedding wide-spread lustre, may he bestow upon us the joys of mortal life)!\'\npronounced in a low voice, are the invitatory and offering formulas of the\nchief oblation. Those of the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t are two anush _t_ ubh verses\n2. Silver is the priests\' fee,--for the sake of variety of colour, and also\nfor the sake of (the horse\'s) going outside 3 and not going away. It weighs a\nhundred (grains), for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred\nenergies: it is life, and energy, vigour, he thus secures for himself.\n\n13:4:2:1111\\. Whilst the fore-offerings of this (ish _t_ i) are being\nperformed, a Brahman lute-player, striking up the uttaramandra (tune), sings\nthree strophes composed by himself (on topics such as), \'Such a sacrifice he\noffered,--Such gifts he gave:\' the meaning of this has been explained.\n\n13:4:2:1212\\. He then prepares a third (offering)--a cake\n\np. 358\n\non twelve potsherds to Savit _ri_ Satyaprasava (\'of true impulse\'); for that,\nindeed, is the true impulse which is Savit _ri_ \'s: \'May he impel with true\nimpulse this my sacrifice!\' so he thinks.\n\n13:4:2:1313\\. For this (ish _t_ i) there are again seventeen kindling-verses.\nThe two butter-portions are possessed of \'wealth 1,\' with a view to his\nobtaining and securing vigour, for wealth is vigour (strength). [The verses,\n_Ri_ g-veda V, 82, 7; IV, 54, 4,] \'The all-divine, true lord (we hope to gain\nthis day by our hymns, Savit _ri_ of true impulsion),\' and \'Indestructible is\nthat (work) of the divine Savit _ri_ , (that he will ever sustain the whole\nworld: whatever he, the fair-fingered, bringeth forth over the extent of the\nearth and the expanse of the sky, that is truly his own),\' pronounced in a low\nvoice, are the invitatory and offering formulas of the chief offering. Those\nof the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (he makes) the regular ones 2, thinking, \'Lest I\nshould depart from the path of sacrifice:\' he thus finally establishes himself\nin the well-ordered sacrifice. Trish _t_ ubh-verses they are for the sake of\nhis gaining and securing (Indra\'s) energy, vigour, for the Trish _t_ ubh is\nthe vigour in Indra. The priests\' fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the\nmeaning of this has been explained 3.\n\n13:4:2:1414\\. Whilst the fore-offerings of this (ish _t_ i) are\n\np. 359\n\nbeing performed, a Brahman lute-player, striking up the uttaramandra (tune),\nsings three strophes composed by himself (on topics such as), \'Such a\nsacrifice he offered,--Such gifts he gave:\' the meaning of this has been\nexplained.\n\n13:4:2:1515\\. When this (offering) is completed, the Adhvaryu and the\nSacrificer rise, and whisper in the horse\'s right ear (Va _g_. S. XXII, 19),\n\'Plenteous by thy mother, strengthful by dry father . . .!\' the meaning of\nthis has been explained 1. They then set it free towards the north-east, for\nthat--to wit, the north-east--is the region of both gods and men: they thus\nconsign it to its own region, in order to its suffering no injury, for one who\nis established in his own home suffers no injury.\n\n13:4:2:1616\\. He says, \'O ye gods, guardians of the regions, guard ye this\nhorse, consecrated for offering unto the gods!\' The (four kinds of) human\nguardians of the (four) regions have been told, and these now are the divine\nones, to wit, the \xc3\x82pyas, Sadhyas, Anvadhyas 2 and Maruts; and both of these,\ngods and men, of one mind, guard it for a year without turning (driving) it\nback. The reason why they do not turn it back, is that it is he that shines\nyonder,--and who, forsooth, is able to turn him back? But were they to turn it\nback, everything here assuredly would go backward (go to ruin): therefore they\nguard it without turning it back.\n\n13:4:2:1717\\. He says, \'Ye guardians of the quarters, those who go on to the\nend of this (horse-sacrifice) will\n\np. 360\n\nbecome (sharers of) the royal power, they will become kings worthy of being\nconsecrated; but those who do not go on to the end of this (sacrifice) will be\nexcluded from royal power, they will not become kings, but nobles and\npeasants, unworthy of being consecrated: do not ye therefore be heedless, and\nkeep it (the horse) from water suitable for bathing and from mares! And\nwhenever ye meet with any kind of Brahma _n_ as, ask ye them, "O Brahma _n_\nas, how much know ye of the A _s_ vamedha?" and those who know naught thereof\nye may despoil; for the A _s_ vamedha is everything, and he who, whilst being\na Brahma _n_ a, knows naught of the A _s_ vamedha, knows naught of anything,\nhe is not a Brahma _n_ a, and as such liable to be despoiled. Ye shall give it\ndrink, and throw down fodder for it; and whatever prepared food there is in\nthe country all that shall be prepared for you. Your abode shall be in the\nhouse of a carpenter of these (sacrificers 1), for there is the horse\'s\nresting-place.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[353:1](sbe44102.htm#fr_908) Viz. according to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. X, 6, 7,-- _Ri_\ng-veda I, 45, 6 (tva _m_ _k_ itra _s_ ravastama) and V, 25, 7 (yad vasish _th_\na _m_ yad agnaye).\n\n[353:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_909) Thus Harisvamin,--\'anyebhyo dakshi _n_\nadhuryebhya utk _ri_ sh _t_ a _h_ ;\' p. 354 hardly \'one which finds no\n(worthy) yoke-fellow\' (St. Petersb. Dict.).\n\n[354:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_910) Or, black with some other colour.\n\n[355:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_911) One would expect an \'iti\' here.\n\n[355:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_912) Or, furnished with bundles of arrows,--ishuparshi\n_n_ a _h_ , for which Katy. XX, 2, 11, has \'kalapina _h_ \' (= _s_\naravapanabhastravanta _h_ schol.). Harisvamin explains it as if it were\nequivalent to \'ishuvarshi _n_ a _h_ ,\' \'showering arrows.\'\n\n[355:3](sbe44103.htm#fr_913) Harisvamin takes \'kshattra\' as the body of\nrevenue-officers (tax-gatherers, &c.), \'ayavyayadhyakshasamuha _h_.\'\n\n[355:4](sbe44103.htm#fr_914) That is, according to Harisvamin, over twenty-\nfour years old; his explanation being based on the etymology of \'nirash _t_\nam\' as \'outside the eight\' (viz. characteristics of age in horses, each of\nwhich is supposed to hold good for three years).\n\n[355:5](sbe44103.htm#fr_915) The three ish _t_ is to Savit _ri_ , treated of\nin paragraphs [6](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:6)-[17](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:17), as well\nas the proceedings subsequent thereto, are repeated every day during the\ntwelvemonth during which the sacred horse is allowed to roam about.\n\n[356:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_916) See [p. 350](sbe44102.htm#page_350), note\n[3](sbe44102.htm#fn_898).\n\n[356:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_917) See [p. 351](sbe44102.htm#page_351), note\n[3](sbe44102.htm#fn_901).\n\n[356:3](sbe44103.htm#fr_918) Or, touching the uttaramandra lute,--literally,\nthe \'upper deep\' one, i.e. perhaps one the chords of which are pitched in the\nupper notes of the lower key. Cf. Scholl. on Katy. XX, 2, 8 uttaramandra _k_ a\ngayanaprasiddha;--uttaramandra-sa _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _m_ vi _n_ ayam. Harisvamin\ndoes not explain the term.\n\n[356:4](sbe44103.htm#fr_919) Taitt. Br. III, 9, 14, 3 mentions three topics--\none for each stanza,--viz. \' _thus_ (such and such gifts) thou gavest, _thus_\n(by such and such sacrifices) thou didst sacrifice, _thus_ thou didst cook\n(i.e. with such and such food thou didst regale the priests).\'\n\n[356:5](sbe44103.htm#fr_920) See [XIII, 1, 5, 6](sbe44078.htm#13:1:5:6).\n\n[357:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_921) That is, their anuvakyas contain forms of the\nroot \'as\' (or \'bhu\'), to be; cf. [p. 352](sbe44102.htm#page_352), note\n[2](sbe44102.htm#fn_903).\n\n[357:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_922) See [XIII, 4, 1, 15](sbe44102.htm#13:4:1:15), [p.\n353](sbe44102.htm#page_353), note 1.\n\n[357:3](sbe44103.htm#fr_923) Viz. going outside the sacrificial ground, and\nyet not running away from its keepers,--this, according to the text, would be\nsymbolically expressed by the gold (which was given as the priests\' fee for\nthe first offering) giving place to silver at the second offering, but coming\nin again at the third.\n\n[358:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_924) That is, their invitatory formulas contain the\nword \'rayi\' (wealth). What particular verses are intended here, I do not know.\n\n[358:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_925) Viz. the trish _t_ ubh-verses _Ri_ g-veda X, 2,\n1; VI, 15, 14; see [p. 351](sbe44102.htm#page_351), note .\n\n[358:3](sbe44103.htm#fr_926) [XII, 7, 2, 13](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:13).\n\n[359:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_927) See [XIII, 1, 6, 1](sbe44079.htm#13:1:6:1) seqq.,\n3, 7. 1-2 seqq.\n\n[359:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_928) On these divine beings see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX,\np. 6, note.\n\n[360:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_929) Thus Harisvamin,--tesha _m_ _k_ a ya _g_ amanana\n_m_ madhye rathakaro yas tasya g _ri_ he yushmaka _m_ vasata _h_. The plural\nis probably meant as including the subjects of the king (cf. [XI, 8, 4,\n1](sbe44044.htm#11:8:4:1)), and the villages within reach of which the horse\nwill roam.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 4, 3. Third Brahma _n_ a](sbe44104.htm)\n\n'
