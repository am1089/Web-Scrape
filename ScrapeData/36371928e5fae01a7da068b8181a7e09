And because in consequence of samavaya being admitted a regressus in\ninfinitum results from parity of reasoning.\n\nYou (the Vai _s_ eshika) admit that a binary compound which originates from\ntwo atoms, while absolutely different from them, is connected with them by the\nrelation of inherence; but on that assumption the doctrine of the atoms being\nthe general cause cannot be established, 'because parity involves here a\nretrogressus ad infinitum.' For just as a binary compound which is absolutely\ndifferent from the two constituent atoms is connected with them by means of\nthe relation of inherence (samavaya), so the relation of inherence itself\nbeing absolutely different from the two things which it connects, requires\nanother relation of inherence to connect it with them, there being absolute\ndifference in both cases. For this second relation of inherence again, a third\nrelation of inherence would have to be assumed and so on ad infinitum.--But--\nthe Vai _s_ eshika is supposed to reply--we are conscious of the so-called\nsamavaya relation as eternally connected with the things between which it\nexists, not as\n\np. 390\n\neither non-connected with them or as depending on another connexion; we are\ntherefore not obliged to assume another connexion, and again another, and so\non, and thus to allow ourselves to be driven into a regressus in infinitum.--\nYour defence is unavailing, we reply, for it would involve the admission that\nconjunction (sa _m_ yoga) also as being eternally connected with the things\nwhich it joins does, like samavaya, not require another connexion  1. If you\nsay that conjunction does require another connexion because it is a different\nthing  2 we reply that then samavaya also requires another connexion because\nit is likewise a different thing. Nor can you say that conjunction does\nrequire another connexion because it is a quality (gu _n_ a), and samavaya\ndoes not because it is not a quality; for (in spite of this difference) the\nreason for another connexion being required is the same in both cases  3, and\nnot that which is technically called 'quality' is the cause (of another\nconnexion being required)  4.--For these reasons those who acknowledge\nsamavaya to be a separate existence are driven into a regressus in infinitum,\nin consequence of which, the impossibility of one term involving the\nimpossibility of the entire series, not even the origination of a binary\ncompound from two atoms can be accounted for.--For this reason also the atomic\ndoctrine is inadmissible.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[390:1](sbe34189.htm#fr_368) Which is inadmissible on Vai _s_ eshika\nprinciples, because sa _m_ yoga as being a quality is connected with the\nthings it joins by samavaya.\n\n[390:2](sbe34189.htm#fr_369) Viz. from those things which are united by\nconjunction. The argument is that conjunction as an independent third entity\nrequires another connexion to connect it with the two things related to each\nother in the way of conjunction.\n\n[390:3](sbe34189.htm#fr_370) Viz. the absolute difference of samavaya and sa\n_m_ yoga from the terms which they connect.\n\n[390:4](sbe34189.htm#fr_371) Action (karman), &c. also standing in the\nsamavaya relation to their substrates.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 14](sbe34190.htm)\n\n"
