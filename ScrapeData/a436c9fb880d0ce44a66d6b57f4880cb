Shree Krishnu Chund Jee having seated\nSuhdeo on the royal throne; and, having given him advice, said to him, "Raja!\ngo now and bring those Rajas, whom your father kept shut up in a hill cave."\nOn hearing these words from the mouth of Krishnu, Joorasindhoo\'s son, Suhdeo,\nconsenting to bring them, went to the cave; and, having removed a stone from\nthe mouth of it, brought forth twenty thousand eight hundred Rajas, and took\nthem to the presence of Huri. On coming there with handcuffs and leg-irons,\niron collars on their necks, their nails and hair grown long, bodies\nemaciated, depressed in spirits, and dirty in appearance, all the Rajas stood\nin rows before Krishnu, joining their hands, they submissively said, "O sea of\ncompassion and brother of the poor! you have thought of us in good time,\notherwise we should have died; by seeing you our lives have been restored, and\nour former griefs have been obliterated."\n\nOn hearing these words, O great king! when Shree Krishnu Chund, the sea of\nfavour, looked upon them; Suhdeo immediately took them away; and, having had\ntheir handcuffs, leg-irons and the rings with which their fetters were\nfastened, cut off, causing them to be shaved and bathed, and washed,\nentertaining them with all sorts of delicacies, giving them clothes\n\np. 370\n\nand ornaments, and furnishing them with arms, brought them again into Huri\'s\npresence; at that time Shree Krishnu Chund Jee appeared to them in a form with\nfour arms, and holding a shell, quoit, club and lotus. On beholding the form\nKrishnu had assumed, the Rajas joining their hands said, "Lord! you liberate\nmortals from the difficult bonds of the world; what difficulty was there to\nyou to release us from the imprisonment of Joorasindhoo? As you have\ncompassionately released us from this severe confinement, release us also from\nthis well in the form of a dwelling, free us from desire, anger, avarice and\ninordinate affection, in order that we may sit down in retirement and meditate\non you, and cross over the sea of the world."\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said, Raja! when all the Rajas had spoken these words, so\nfull of knowledge and devotion, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee was delighted and\nsaid, "They who worship me with sincerity of mind, shall certainly obtain\ndeliverance and salvation; bondage and release are trials of the mind, to him\nwhose mind is firm; the house and forest are alike; have no other anxiety in\nyour minds, than living happily at your homes; carry on a well regulated\ngovernment, protect the subject; attend upon the cow and brahmin; do not speak\nfalsely; avoid lust, anger, avarice and pride; worship Huri with sentiments of\nreligion, and you will certainly obtain eternal happiness; whoever, coming\ninto the world, has indulged in pride, has not lived long; behold! how many\npride has brought to destruction. His strength destroyed Pursooram, celebrated\nas being very powerful, and having a thousand arms. Raja Bynoo became Rawun,\nand was ruined by his pride. Bhomasoor and Banasoor, and Kuns were all\nexterminated through pride. Let no one be intoxicated with prosperity, or\nindulge in pride; he who shuns pride may live without fear."\n\nHaving thus spoken, Shree Krishnu Chund said to all the Rajas, "Go now to your\nhomes, have meetings with you\n\np. 371\n\nrelations, arrange the affairs of your kingdoms and settle yourselves upon\nyour thrones, and come quickly, about the time of my own arrival, to\nHustinapoor, to the Raja Joodisthur\'s, to assist at the royal sacrifice."\n\nO great king! when Shree Krishnu Chund Jee had thus spoken, Suhdeo instantly\nprocured all things necessary for the departure of the Rajas. They received\nthem; and, taking leave of Krishnu, went each to his own country, and Shree\nKrishnu Chund Jee also travelled thence joyfully, accompanied by Suhdeo and\nBheem, and Urjoon, and came to Hustinapoor. Krishnu having gone, after his\narrival, to the Raja Joodisthur, explained to him all the circumstances,\nattending the death of Joorasindhoo, and the release of the Rajas.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! about the time of the arrival of Shree Krishnu\nChund, the root of joy, at Hustinapoor, the Rajas arrived also with their\narmies, and with presents; and, having had an interview with Raja Joodisthur,\nand offered their presents, they encamped on all sides of Hustinapoor by order\nof Shree Krishnu Chund Jee, and prepared to assist in the sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXV](psa76.htm)\n\n'
