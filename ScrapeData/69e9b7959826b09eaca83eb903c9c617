(Matter in its subtle state) subserves an end, on account of its\ndependence on him (viz. the Supreme Person).\n\nMatter in its subtle state subserves ends, in so far only as it is dependent\non the Supreme Person who is the cause of all. We by no means wish to deny\nunevolved matter and all its effects in themselves, but in so far only as they\nare maintained not to have their Self in the Supreme Person. For the fact is\nthat they constitute his body and He thus constitutes their Self; and it is\nonly through this their relation to him that the Pradhana, and so on, are\ncapable of accomplishing their several ends. Otherwise the different essential\nnatures of them all could never\n\np. 359\n\nexist,--nor persist, nor act. It is just on the ground of this dependence on\nthe Lord not being acknowledged by the Sa _n_ khyas that their system is\ndisproved by us. In Scripture and Sm _ri_ ti alike, wherever the origination\nand destruction of the world are described, or the greatness of the Supreme\nPerson is glorified, the Pradhana and all its effects, no less than the\nindividual souls, are declared to have their Self in that Supreme Person.\nCompare, e.g. the text which first says that the earth is merged in water, and\nfurther on \'the elements are merged in the Mahat, the Mahat in the Unevolved,\nthe Unevolved in the Imperishable, the Imperishable in Darkness; Darkness\nbecomes one with the highest divinity.\' And \'He of whom the earth is the\nbody,\' &c. up to \'he of whom the Unevolved is the body; of whom the\nImperishable is the body; of whom death is the body; he the inner Self of all\nbeings, free from all evil, the divine one, the one God Naraya _n_ a." And\nEarth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect, egoity--thus eightfold is my\nnature divided. Lower is this nature; other than this and higher know that\nnature of mine which has become the individual soul by which this world is\nsupported. Remember that all beings spring from this; I am the origin and the\ndissolution of the whole Universe. Higher than I there is none else; all this\nis strung on me as pearls on a thread\' (Bha. Gi VII, 4-7). And \'the Evolved is\nVish _n_ u, and the Unevolved, he is the Person and time.--The nature (prak\n_ri_ ti) declared by me, having the double form of the Evolved and the\nUnevolved, and the soul-both these are merged in the highest Self. That Self\nis the support of all, the Supreme Person who under the name of Vish _n_ u is\nglorified in the Vedas and the Vedanta books.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
