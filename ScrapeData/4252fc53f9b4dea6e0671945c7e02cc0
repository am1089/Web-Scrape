Yas\xc2\x92ovati spoke :-- O King! One day Ekavali got up early in the morning\nand went to the banks of the Ganges, accompanied by her companions; they began\nto fan her with a chowrie. The armed guards accompanied her. Slowly she went\nwhere there were the lotuses in order to sport with them. I, too, went with\nher playing with the lotuses to the banks of the Ganges and both of us began\nto play with lotuses with the Apsaras. When both of us were deeply engaged in\nthe play, then one powerful Danava, named Kalaketu, came up there suddenly\nwith many Rak _s_ asas armed with parighas, swords, clubs, bows, arrows and\ntomaras and many other weapons. Ekavali was playing with the best lotuses when\nKalaketu saw her in that state, blooming with beauty and youth as if like\nRati, the Goddess of Love. O King! I then spoke to Ekavali :-- \xc2\x93Look! Who is\nthis Daitya that has come here unexpectedly; O Lotus-eyed One! Let us go into\nthe central part of our armed guards.\xc2\x94 O King! My companion and myself\nconsulting thus, went out of fear immediately into the centre of the armed\nguards. Kalaketu was seized with the arrows of Cupid, and no sooner he looked\nat that beautiful young lady than he, with a very big club in his hand,\nhurriedly came to us, drove away the guards, and took away my lotus eyed\ncompanion, of thin waist. Then the young lady, helpless, began to tremble and\ncried aloud.\n\n\n\n11-22. Seeing this, I spoke to the Danava :-- Leave her and take me. The\npassionate Danava did not take me but he went away, taking my\n\n\n\np. 561\n\n\n\ncompanion. The guards exclaimed :-- \xc2\x93Wait, wait; don\xc2\x92t fly away with the girl;\nwe are giving you a good lesson.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, they made the powerful Danavas\nstop and both the parties engaged in a very terrible conflict, astounding to\nall. The followers of the Danavas, more cruel and all fully armed began at\nonce to fight with great enthusiasm for their Master\xc2\x92s cause. Kalaketu himself\nbegan to fight afterwards terribly and killed the guards. He, then, with his\nfollowers, carried away my companion towards his own city. I, too, followed my\ncompanion, when I saw her thus carried away by the Danava and crying out of\nfear. I also walked crying aloud by those tracks as would enable my Sakhi to\nsee me. She, too, seeing me, became somewhat consoled. Crying out repeatedly I\napproached her. She was already very distressed and when she saw me, she\nclasped me closely around my neck, perspiring and stunned and, becoming more\ndistressed, cried aloud. Kalaketu then showed his liking for me and told that\nmy quick-eyed companion was very afraid and that I might comfort her. He told\nme thus :-- \xc2\x93O Dear! My city is like the Deva\xc2\x92s abodes; you will soon be able\nto go there. From today I become your slave, bound by love. Do not cry thus\ndistressedly; be comforted.\xc2\x94 In these words he told me to comfort my dear\ncompanion. Thus speaking, that villain made both of us mount on the beautiful\nchariot and making us sit by his sides went gladly and quickly to his own\nbeautiful palace, followed by his army.\n\n\n\n23-30. That Demon placed both of us in a beautiful house white washed and\nmirror-like and kept hundreds and thousands of Rak _s_ asas to watch and\nprotect us. On the second day he called me in private :-- \xc2\x93Your companion is\nvery much distressed on the bereavement from her father and mother and is\nlamenting; make her understand and console her.\xc2\x94 He told me to speak the\nfollowing words to my companion :-- \xc2\x93O One of beautiful hips! Be my wife and\nenjoy as you like. O One with a face beautiful like the Moon! This kingdom is\nyours; ever I am your obedient slave.\xc2\x94 Hearing his unbearable harsh words I\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! I will not be able to speak her these words, disagreeable to\nher. You better speak this yourself.\xc2\x94 When I spoke thus, that wicked Danava\nstruck by the arrows of Cupid began to speak gently to my dear companion of\nthin belly, thus :-- \xc2\x93O Dear One! Today you have successfully cast on me the\nVasikara _n_ a Mantra (one of the Tantrik processes by which a lover is made\nto come under subjection); O Beloved! Therefore it is that my heart is stolen\nand so much brought under your subjection; this has converted me into a\nveritable slave of yours; then know this as certain that I am your slave; O\nSweet One!\n\n\n\np. 562\n\n\n\nI am very much troubled by the Cupid\xc2\x92s arrows and I am semi-unconscious;\ntherefore O Lean-bellied One! Worship me. O One of beautiful thighs! This\nyouth is a very rare and transient thing; O Auspicious One! Now embrace me as\nyour husband and make your youth a veritable success.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n31-36. Ekavali said :-- \xc2\x93O Fortunate One! My father wanted to hand me over to\na prince named Haihaya; I also mentally adopted him as my husband. You are\ncertainly aware of the S\xc2\x92astras; how can I now abandon the eternal religion\nand the virtue of a woman and take up another husband. The girl must accept\nhim to whom the father betrothes. The girl is under every circumstances\ndependent. Never do they get any independence.\xc2\x94 Though Ekavali said thus, the\nvicious Daitya struck by Cupid\xc2\x92s arrows, did not desist and did not leave me\nand that larged-eyed companion. His city lies in Patala and is a very\ndangerous place; always it is guarded by Rak _s_ asas and surrounded by a\nmoat; inside is built a beautiful and strong fort. Now my dear companion, the\nqueen of my heart, is staying there with a grievous heart and I am here\nwandering hither and thither very much troubled on account of her\nbereavements.\n\n\n\n37-46. Ekavira said :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful-faced One! How have you been able to get\naway from the city of that wicked demon and how have you been able to come\nhere? I am perfectly at my wit\xc2\x92s end. Say quickly all these. O Proud One! I\ndoubt your words; the father of your dear companion resolved to give his\ndaughter to Haihaya in marriage; now I am that Haihaya. I am the King by that\nname, on this earth; there is no other King by the name of Haihaya. Is it that\nyour dear companion is meant for me? O Bhamini (passionate woman)! Remove my\ndoubts; I will kill that villain Rak _s_ asa and bring just now your dear\ncompanion; there is no doubt in this. O One of good vows! Shew me that place,\nif it be known to you. Has anybody informed her father that She is suffering\nfrom so many troubles? Has her father come to know that her daughter has been\nstolen and carried away? And has he made any effort to rescue her from the\nhands of that villain Rak _s_ asa? Is it that the King is calm and quiet,\nknowing that his daughter has been kept in prison? Or is it that he is unable\nto free her from bondage? Say quickly all these things before me. O Lotus-eyed\nOne! You have captivated my mind by describing the extraordinary qualities of\nyour dear companion and have made me passionate too. Alas! When will it be\nthat I will free my beautiful beloved from the greatest perilous situation and\nshall see her face and her eyes, beaming with joy. O Sweet-speaking One! Say,\nby what means I can go to that impassable city. How have you been able to come\nfrom there?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 563\n\n\n\n47-63. Yas\xc2\x92ovati said :-- O King! In my early age I got the Mantram of the\nDevi Bhagavati with its seed Mantram (mystic syllable involving in it the\npower connoted by the Devi) and how to meditate it. While I was in the\nDanava\xc2\x92s place I thought out that at that juncture I would worship the\npowerful Chandika who gives instantaneously one\xc2\x92s own desires. If I worship\nthat S\xc2\x92akti, That fructifies all desires, That is all mercy to Her Bhaktas,\ncertainly She will free my dear companion from this her bondage. Though She is\nreally without form, yet She, without anybody\xc2\x92s help, by Her own force, She is\ncreating, preserving, and at the end of the Kalpa, destroying this Universe.\nOh! She is very wonderful indeed! Thus thinking I began to meditate that\nauspicious red-robed and red-eyed Devi, the Lady of the Universe, and\nrecollected mentally Her form and repeated silently Her Vija Mantram. When I\nmeditated thus for merely one month, Chandika Devi became, through my\ndevotion, manifest to me in my dreams and began to speak in sweet nectar-like\nwords :-- \xc2\x93You are now asleep; go quickly to the beautiful banks of the\nGanges. The enemy destroyer, the powerful Ekavira, the greatest of all the\nkings, will come there. Dattatreya, the Great Lord of the Munis, has given him\nmy Mantra named Mahavidya; the King also constantly worships me devotedly with\nthat. His mind is constantly attached to Me and he constantly worships Me.\nWhat more to say than this fact that the king, extremely devoted to Me,\nmeditates on Me as the internal controller of all beings. That intelligent son\nof Lak _s_ mi will come for sport to the banks of the Ganges and will remove\nall your sorrows. That king Ekavira, versed in all the S\xc2\x92astras will kill the\nRak _s_ asas in a dreadful battle and will rescue Ekavali. So now you pay heed\nto my word.\xc2\x94 Lastly, She told me that my companion should marry that beautiful\nKing, endowed with all auspicious qualifications. Thus saying, She disappeared\nand I instantly woke up. Then I informed my lotus-eyed dear Sakhi all the\ndetails of my dream as well my worshipping the Devi; hearing this, her lotus-\nface beamed with joy and gladness. That sweet-smiling Ekavali very gladly told\nme, \xc2\x93O dear Companion! Go at once for our success. That truth-speaking\nBhagavati Ambika Devi will release us from our bondage.\xc2\x94 O King! When my dear\ncompanion ordered me thus, I thought it proper, as also dictated to me in my\ndream, to go out and soon I did it. O King! Due to the grace of the Great\nDevi, I came to know the way and I also got the quick motion. Thus I have\ndescribed to you the cause of my sorrow. O Hero! Who are you, whose son are\nyou? Speak truly to me.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-second Chapter in the Sixth Book on the narration to\nHaihaya the stealing away of Ekavali in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 23](bk06ch23.htm)\n\n'
