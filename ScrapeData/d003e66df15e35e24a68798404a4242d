A child also cannot be (made a witness), nor a woman, nor one man alone, nor a cheat, nor a relative, nor an enemy. These persons might give false evidence.\n\np. 90\n\n* 191. A child would speak falsely from ignorance, a woman from want of veracity, an impostor from habitual depravity, a relative from affection, an enemy from desire of revenge.\n\n* 192. 192 By consent of both parties, one man alone even may become a witness in a suit. He must be examined in public as a witness, though (he has been mentioned as) an incompetent witness.\n\n* 193. 193 One who, weighed down by the consciousness of his guilt looks as if he was ill, is constantly shifting his position, and runs after everybody;\n\n* 194. Who walks irresolutely and without reason, and draws repeated sighs; who scratches the ground with his feet, and who shakes his arm and clothes;\n\n* 195. Whose countenance changes colour, whose forehead sweats, whose lips become dry, and who looks above and about him;\n\n* 196. Who makes long speeches which are not to the purpose as if he were in a hurry, and without being asked: such a person may be recognised as a false witness, and the king should punish that sinful man.\n\n* 197. 197 He who conceals his knowledge (at the time\n\np. 91\n\nof trial), although he has previously related (what he knows) to others,\ndeserves specially heavy punishment, for he is more criminal than a false\nwitness even.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[86:177](sbe3321.htm#fr_260) 177-187, 190.
