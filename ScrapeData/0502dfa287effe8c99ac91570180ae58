D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n#### IV. The Infinite I 2\n\n"Verily this All is Brahma. It has therein its birth, end, breath; as such one\nshould worship it in stillness.\n\nVerily man is made of will. As is man\'s will\n\np. 64\n\nin this world, such he becomes on going hence; so let him frame the will.\n\nMade of mind, bodied in breath, shaped in light, real of purpose, ethereal of\nsoul, all-working, all-desiring, all-smelling, all-tasting, grasping this All,\nspeaking naught, heeding naught--this is my Self within my heart, smaller than\na rice-corn, or a barley-corn, or a mustard-seed, or a canary-seed, or the\npulp of a canary-seed--this is my Self within my heart, greater than earth,\ngreater than sky, greater than heaven, greater than these worlds. All-working,\nall-desiring, all-smelling, all-tasting, grasping this All, speaking naught,\nheeding naught--this is my Self within my heart, this is Brahma; to Him shall\nI win when I go hence. He with whom it is thus has indeed no doubt." Thus\nspake \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8dilya.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[63:1](brk31.htm#fr_17) They pass every day into dreamless sleep, the perfect\nunion with Brahma in the heart; but they are not conscious of this union, and\nthe condition of their existence causes it to be only temporary.
