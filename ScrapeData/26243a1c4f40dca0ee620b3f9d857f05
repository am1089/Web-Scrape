The Year, indeed, is Man;--the opening (praya _n_ iya) Atiratra is\nhis feet, for by means of their\n\np. 145\n\nfeet (men) go forward (prayanti): that part of them which is white is of the\nform of the day, and that which is black is (of the form) of the night; the\nnails are of the form of herbs and trees. The _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a day is the\nthighs, the Abhiplava the breast, and the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya the back.\n\n12:1:4:22\\. The Abhi _g_ it is this right arm, the Svarasaman days these three\n(openings of the) vital airs on the right side 1 the Vishuvat the head, and\nthe (second period of) Svarasaman days these three vital airs on the left\nside.\n\n12:1:4:33\\. The Vi _s_ va _g_ it is this left arm,--the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya and\nAbhiplava have been told,--the Go and \xc3\x82yus those downward vital airs; the Da\n_s_ aratra the limbs, the Mahavrata the mouth; and the concluding (udayaniya)\nAtiratra is the hands, for by means of the hands (men) move (reach) upwards\n(udyanti) that part of them which is white is of the form of the day, and that\nwhich is black is of that of the night; and the nails are of the form of the\nstars. Thus that year is established in respect of the body; and, verily,\nwhosoever thus knows that year to be established in respect of the body,\nestablishes himself by means of offspring and cattle in this, and by\nimmortality in the other, world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[145:1](sbe44048.htm#fr_439) Viz. the right eye, ear, and nostril.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 2, 1.
