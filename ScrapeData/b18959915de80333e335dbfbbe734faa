On account of there being no special characteristic; as in the case of the\ncup.\n\nIn the discussion of the following passages also we aim only at refuting the\nsystem of the Sankhyas; not at disproving the existence and nature of Prak\n_ri_ ti, the 'great' principle, the aha _m_ ara, and so on, viewed as\ndependent on Brahman. For that they exist in this latter relation is proved by\nScripture as well as Sm _ri_ ti.--A text of the followers of the Atharvan runs\nas follows: 'Her who produces all effects, the non-knowing one, the unborn\none, wearing eight forms, the firm one--she is known (by the Lord) and ruled\nby him, she is spread out and incited and ruled by him, gives birth to the\nworld for the benefit of the souls. A cow she is without beginning and end, a\nmother producing all beings; white, black, and red, milking all wishes for the\nLord. Many babes unknown drink her. the impartial one;\n\np. 364\n\nbut one God only, following his own will, drinks her submitting to him. By his\nown thought and work the mighty God strongly enjoys her, who is common to all,\nthe milkgiver, who is pressed by the sacrifices. The Non-evolved when being\ncounted by twenty-four is called the Evolved.' This passage evidently\ndescribes the nature of Prak _ri_ ti, and so on, and the same Upanishad also\nteaches the Supreme Person who constitutes the Self of Prak _ri_ ti, and so\non. 'Him they call the twenty-sixth or also the twenty-seventh; as the Person\ndevoid of all qualities of the Sa _n_ khyas he is known by the followers of\nthe Atharvan 1.'--Other followers of the Atharvan read in their text that\nthere are sixteen originating principles (prak _ri_ ti) and eight effected\nthings (vikara; Garbha Up. 3).--The _S_ veta _s_ vataras again set forth the\nnature of Prak _ri_ ti, the soul and the Lord as follows. 'The Lord supports\nall this together, the Perishable and the Imperishable, the Evolved and the\nUnevolved; the other one is in bondage, since he is an enjoyer; but having\nknown the God he is free from all fetters. There are two unborn ones, the one\nknowing and a Lord, the other without knowledge and lordly power; there is the\none unborn female on whom the enjoyment of all enjoyers depends; and there is\nthe infinite Self appearing in all shapes, but itself inactive. When a man\nfinds out these three, that is Brahman. The Perishable is the Pradhana, the\nImmortal and Imperishable is Hara; the one God rules the Perishable and the\nSelf. From meditation on him, from union with him, from becoming one with him\nthere is in the end cessation of all Maya' ( _S_ vet. Up. I, 8-10). And 'The\nsacred verses, the offerings, the sacrifices, the vows, the past, the future,\nand all that the Vcdas declare--from that the Ruler of Maya creates all this;\nand in this the other one is bound up through Maya. Know then Prak _ri_ ti to\nbe Maya and the great Lord the ruler of Maya; with his members this\n\np. 365\n\nwhole world is filled' ( _S_ vet. Up. V, 9-10). And, further on, 'The master\nof Pradhana and the soul, the lord of the gu _n_ as, the cause of the bondage,\nexistence, and release of worldly existence' (VI, 16). Thus likewise in Sm\n_ri_ ti, 'Do thou know both Nature and the soul to be without beginning, and\nknow all effects and qualities to have sprung from Nature. Nature is declared\nto be the cause of the activity of causes and effects, whilst the soul is the\ncause of there being enjoyment of pleasure and pain. For the soul abiding in\nNature experiences the qualities derived from Nature, the reason being its\nconnexion with the qualities, in its births in good and evil wombs' (Bha. Gi.\nXIII, 19-21). And 'Goodness, Passion, and Darkness--these are the qualities\nwhich, issuing from nature, bind in the body the embodied soul, the undecaying\none' (XIV, 5). And 'All beings at the end of a kalpa return into my Nature,\nand again, at the beginning of a kalpa, do I send them forth. Presiding over\nmy own nature again and again do I send forth this vast body of beings which\nhas no freedom of its own, being subject to Nature.--With me as ruler Nature\nbrings forth all moving and non-moving things, and for this reason the world\ndoes ever go round' (Bha. Gi. IX, 7, 8, 10). What we therefore refuse to\naccept are a Prak _ri_ ti, and so on, of the kind assumed by Kapila, i.e. not\nhaving their Self in Brahman.--We now proceed to explain the Sutra.\n\nWe read in the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-Upanishad 'There is one a _g_ a, red,\nwhite, and black, producing manifold offspring of the same nature. One a _g_ a\nloves her and lies by her; another leaves her after having enjoyed her.' A\ndoubt arises here whether this mantra declares a mere Prak _ri_ ti as assumed\nin Kapila's system, or a Prak _ri_ ti having its Self in Brahman.\n\nThe Purvapakshin maintains the former alternative. For, he points out, the\ntext refers to the non-originatedness of Prak _ri_ ti, calling her a _g_ a,\ni.e. unborn, and further says that she by herself independently produces\nmanifold offspring resembling herself. This view is rejected by the Sutra, on\nthe ground that there is no intimation of a special circumstance determining\nthe acceptance of the Prak _ri_ ti as\n\np. 366\n\nassumed by the Sa _n_ khyas, i.e. independent of Brahman; for that she is a\n_g_ a, i. e. not born, is not a sufficiently special characteristic. The case\nis analogous to that of the 'cup.' In the mantra 'There is a cup having its\nmouth below and its bottom above' (B _ri_. Up. II, 2, 3), the word _k_ amasa\nconveys to us only the idea of some implement used in eating, but we are\nunable to see what special kind of _k_ amasa is meant; for in the case of\nwords the meaning of which is ascertained on the ground of their derivation\n(as ' _k_ amasa' from 'kam,' to eat or drink), the special sense of the word\nin any place cannot be ascertained without the help of considerations of\ngeneral possibility, general subject-matter, and so on. Now in the case of the\ncup we are able to ascertain that the cup meant is the head, because there is\na complementary passage 'What is called the cup with its mouth below and its\nbottom above is the head'; but if we look out for a similar help to determine\nthe special meaning of a _g_ a, we find nothing to convince us that the a _g_\na, i. e. the 'unborn' principle, is the Prak _ri_ ti of the Sa _n_ khyas. Nor\nis there anything in the text to convey the idea of that a _g_ a having the\npower of independent creation; for the clause 'giving birth to manifold\noffspring' declares only that she creates, not that she creates unaided. The\nmantra does not therefore tell us about an 'unborn' principle independent of\nBrahman.--There moreover is a special reason for understanding by the a _g_ a\nsomething that depends on Brahman. This the following Sutra states.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[364:1](sbe48150.htm#fr_33) These quotations are from the _K_ ulika-Upanishad\n(transl. by Deussen, Seventy Upanishads, p. 638 ff.)
