Even as\nharnessed cattle here on earth\n\np. 370\n\ndraw for men, so do the harnessed metres draw the sacrifice for the gods. And\nwhenever the metres gratified the gods, then the gods gratified the metres.\nNow it has been previous to this, that the harnessed metres have drawn the\nsacrifice to the gods, that they have gratified them 1:\n\n4:4:3:22\\. He now draws the Hariyo _g_ ana 2 graha--the Hariyo _g_ ana being\nthe metres--it is the metres he thereby gratifies: this is why he draws the\nHariyo _g_ ana graha.\n\n4:4:3:33\\. He draws it as an additional (libation); since\n\np. 371\n\nhe draws it when he (the Hot _ri_ ) pronounces the 'All-hail and blessing 1.'\nFor there are here the gods, and the metres in addition to them; and there are\nmen, and beasts in addition to them: therefore he draws it as an additional\none.\n\n4:4:3:44\\. He draws it in the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a. Now Soma was V _ri_ tra.\nWhen the gods slew him, his head rolled off 2: it became the Dro _n_ akala _s_\na. Thereinto flowed together so much of the juice as it could hold 3; that was\nin excess; and so is this graha in excess: he thus puts the excess. to the\nexcess,--therefore he draws it in the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a.\n\n4:4:3:55\\. He draws it without a puroru _k_ -formula, for he draws it for the\nmetres; and in that he draws it for the metres, even thereby that (graha) of\nhis becomes supplied with a puroru _k_ : therefore he draws it without a\npuroru _k_.\n\n4:4:3:66\\. He now draws it from that (\xc3\x82graya _n_ a graha) with (Va _g_. S.\nVIII, it), 'Thou art taken with a support: of bay colour art thou, meet for\nthe team of bay steeds,--thee to the pair of bay steeds!' Now, the two bay\nhorses are the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman: it is for the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman that he\ndraws it.\n\n4:4:3:77\\. He then pours parched grain into it with, 'Ye are the bays' grains,\nunited with the Soma for\n\np. 372\n\n[paragraph continues] Indra!' Whatever metres there are, both measured and\nunmeasured, they all thereby drink (of the Soma 1).\n\n4:4:3:88\\. For this (libation) the Unnet _ri_  2 calls for the _S_ rausha _t_\n;--for the Unnet _ri_ is in excess (additional), since he does not call for\nthe _S_ rausha _t_ for any other (libation); and this libation also is in\nexcess: thus he puts the excess to the excess,--therefore the Unnet _ri_ calls\nfor the _S_ rausha _t_.\n\n4:4:3:99\\. Placing (the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a) on his head, he calls for the _S_\nrausha _t_ ,--for this (vessel) is his (Soma's) head. He first says (to the\nMaitravaru _n_ a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) for the Soma-draughts with\ngrains!' Having called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, 'Prompt (the Hot _ri_\nto pronounce the offering prayer on) the Soma-draughts with grain brought\nforward 3!' and offers as the Vasha _t_ and Anuvasha _t_ are uttered. They\nthen divide the grain between them for the sake of the Soma-draught.\n\n4:4:3:1010\\. Now some take the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a over to the Hot _ri_ , on\nthe ground that 'the draught belongs to the utterer of the Vasha _t_.' But let\nhim not do it thus; for the other draughts are (taken by the respective\npriests) according to the _k_ amasa cups, but this one is in excess: therefore\nthere is a draught in it for all of them,--for this reason they divide the\ngrain between them for the sake of the Soma-draught.\n\np. 373\n\n4:4:3:1111\\. They must not bite them with their teeth,--for these (grains)\nmean cattle,--thinking 'lest we should do aught to crush our cattle!' They\nonly drink it in with their breath 1, with (Va,;. S. VIII, 12), 'What horse-\nwinning, what cow-winning draught is thine 2;' for they are cattle: therefore\nhe says, 'what horse-winning, what cow-winning draught is thine;'--'Of that\ndraught, offered with Ya _g_ us, praised by chants 3,'--for Ya _g_ us-prayers\nhave indeed been offered, and chants have been chanted;--'sung by hymns,'--for\nsongs ( _s_ astras) have been sung;--'Of the invited 4 do I drink, invited,'--\nfor invited, he now drinks of the invited.\n\n4:4:3:1212\\. They must not throw them into the fire, lest they offer remains\n(of offerings) in the fire. They rather throw them on the high altar: thus\nthey are not excluded from the sacrifice.\n\n4:4:3:1313\\. Thereupon they touch the vessels filled (with water 5) which some\ncall Apsushoma _h_ (Soma-draughts in water). For even as a yoked (animal)\ndraws, so\n\np. 374\n\ndo they who perform the priestly duties. But the yoked (animal) galls or\nscratches itself; and water is a means of soothing, a medicine: thus wherever\nin this (sacrifice) they gall or scratch themselves--water being a means of\nsoothing--they soothe by that means of soothing, water; they heal it by water.\nThis is why they touch the vessels filled (with water).\n\n4:4:3:1414\\. They touch them with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 14), 'With lustre, with\nsap, with bodies 1 have we united,--with the happy spirit: may Tvash _t_ _ri_\n, the dispenser of boons, grant us riches, and may he smooth what was injured\nin our body!' thus they heal what was torn.\n\n4:4:3:1515\\. They then touch their faces. There is a twofold reason why they\ntouch their faces;--water, forsooth, is the elixir of immortality: it is with\nthe elixir of immortality that they thus touch themselves. And, moreover, they\nthus deposit that holy work into their own self: therefore they touch their\nfaces.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[370:1](sbe2657.htm#fr_861) See I, 8, 2, 8; the translation has been amended\nin accordance with Professor Whitney's suggestions, American Journal of\nPhilology, III, p. 406.\n\n[370:2](sbe2657.htm#fr_862) That is, referring to the 'hari-yo _g_ ana,' or\n(Indra's) team of bay steeds.\n\n[371:1](sbe2657.htm#fr_863) For the _S_ am-yos, see part i, p. 254, note.

Those priests who have no cups of their own touch the cups of\nthose with whom they are most nearly connected, viz. the four Adhvaryus that\nof the Nesh _t_ _ri_ the Udgat _ri_ 's assistants that of their principal, the\nGravastut that of the Hot _ri_. Thereupon they touch their faces and betake\nthemselves to the \xc3\x82gnidhra fire-house, to partake of sour milk.
