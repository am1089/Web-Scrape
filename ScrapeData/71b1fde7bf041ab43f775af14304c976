And now I will go into the garden of the\nking\'s brother-in-law, wash it in the pond, and go away as soon as I can. [\n_He walks about and washes the robe_.]\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. Shtop, you confounded monk, shtop!\n\n_Monk_. [ _Discovers the speaker. Fearfully_.] Heaven help me! Here is the\nking\'s brother-in-law, Sansth\xc4\x81naka. Just because one monk committed an\noffense, now, wherever he sees a monk, whether it is the same one or not, he\nbores a hole in his nose and drives him around like a bullock. Where shall a\ndefenseless man find a defender? But after all, the blessed Lord Buddha is my\ndefender.\n\np. 110\n\n[ _Enter the courtier, carrying a sword, and Sansth \xc4\x81naka_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Shtop, you confounded monk, shtop! I\'ll pound your head like a\nred radish 1 at a drinking party. [ _He strikes him_.]\n\n_Courtier_. You jackass, you should not strike a monk who wears the yellow\nrobes of renunciation. Why heed him? Look rather upon this garden, which\noffers itself to pleasure.\n\nTo creatures else forlorn, the forest trees  \nDo works of mercy, granting joy and ease;  \nLike a sinner\'s heart, the park unguarded lies,  \nLike some new-founded realm, an easy prize.4\n\n_Monk_. Heaven bless you! Be merciful, servant of the Blessed One!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Did you hear that, shir? He\'s inshulting me.\n\n_Courtier_. What does he say?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Shays I\'m a shervant. What do you take me for? a barber?\n\n_Courtier_. A servant of the Blessed One he calls you, and this is praise.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Praise me shome more, monk!\n\n_Monk_. You are virtuous! You are a brick!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Shee? He shays I\'m virtuous. He shays I\'m a brick. What do you\nthink I am? a materialistic philosopher? or a watering-trough? or a pot-maker?\n2\n\n_Courtier_. You jackass, he praises you when he says that you are virtuous,\nthat you are a brick.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Well, shir, what did he come here for?\n\n_Monk_. To wash this robe.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Confound the monk! My shishter\'s husband gave me the finesht\ngarden there is, the garden Pushpakaranda. Dogs and jackals drink the water in\nthish pond. Now I\'m an arishtocrat, I\'m\n\np. 111\n\na man, and I don\'t even take a bath. And here you bring your shtinking\nclothes, all shtained with shtale bean-porridge, and wash \xc2\x92em! I think one\ngood shtroke will finish you.\n\n_Courtier_. You jackass, I am sure he has not long been a monk.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. How can you tell, shir?\n\n_Courtier_. It doesn\'t take much to tell that. See!\n\nHis hair is newly shorn; the brow still white;  \nThe rough cloak has not yet the shoulder scarred;  \nHe wears it awkwardly; it clings not tight;  \nAnd here above, the fit is sadly marred.5\n\n_Monk_. True, servant of the Blessed One. I have been a monk but a short time.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Then why haven\'t you been one all your life? [ _He beats\nhim_.]\n\n_Monk_. Buddha be praised!\n\n_Courtier_. Stop beating the poor fellow. Leave him alone. Let him go.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Jusht wait a minute, while I take counshel.\n\n_Courtier_. With whom?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. With my own heart.\n\n_Courtier_. Poor fellow! Why didn\'t he escape?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Blesshed little heart, my little shon and mashter, shall the\nmonk go, or shall the monk shtay? [ _To himself_.] Neither go, nor shtay. [\n_Aloud_.] Well, shir, I took counshel with my heart, and my heart shays\xc2\x97\n\n_Courtier_. Says what?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. He shall neither go, nor shtay. He shall neither breathe up,\nnor breathe down. He shall fall down right here and die, before you can shay\n"boo."\n\n_Monk_. Buddha be praised! I throw myself upon your protection.\n\n_Courtier_. Let him go.\n\np. 112\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Well, on one condition.\n\n_Courtier_. And what is that?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. He musht shling mud in, without making the water dirty. Or\nbetter yet, he musht make the water into a ball, and shling it into the mud.\n\n_Courtier_. What incredible folly!\n\nThe patient earth is burdened by  \n  So many a fool, so many a drone,  \nWhose thoughts and deeds are all awry\xc2\x97  \n  These trees of flesh, these forms of stone.6\n\n[ _The monk makes faces at Sansth \xc4\x81naka_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. What does he mean?\n\n_Courtier_. He praises you.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Praise me shome more! Praise me again! [ _The monk does so,\nthen exit_.]\n\n_Courtier_. See how beautiful the garden is, you jackass.\n\nSee yonder trees, adorned with fruit and flowers,  \n  O\xc2\x92er which the clinging creepers interlace;  \nThe watchmen guard them with the royal powers;  \n  They seem like men whom loving wives embrace.7\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. A good deshcription, shir.\n\nThe ground is mottled with a lot of flowers;  \nThe blosshom freight bends down the lofty trees;  \nAnd, hanging from the leafy tree-top bowers,  \nThe monkeys bob, like breadfruit in the breeze.8\n\n_Courtier_. Will you be seated on this stone bench, you jackass?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I am sheated. [ _They seat themselves_.] Do you know, shir, I\nremember that Vasantasen\xc4\x81 even yet. She is like an inshult. I can\'t get her\nout of my mind.\n\n_Courtier_. [Aside.] He remembers her even after such a repulse. For indeed,\n\np. 113\n\nThe mean man, whom a woman spurns,  \n        But loves the more;  \nThe wise man\'s passion gentler burns,  \n        Or passes o\xc2\x92er.9\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Shome time has passhed, shir, shince I told my shervant\nSth\xc4\x81varaka to take the bullock-cart and come as quick as he could. And even\nyet he is not here. I\'ve been hungry a long time, and at noon a man can\'t go\na-foot. For shee!\n\nThe shun is in the middle of the shky,  \n  And hard to look at as an angry ape;  \nLike G\xc4\x81ndh\xc4\x81r\xc4\xab, whose hundred shons did die,  \n  The earth is hard dishtresshed and can\'t eshcape.10\n\n_Courtier_. True.\n\nThe cattle all\xc2\x97their cuds let fall\xc2\x97  \n  Lie drowsing in the shade;  \nIn heated pool their lips to cool,  \n  Deer throng the woodland glade;  \nA prey to heat, the city street  \n  Makes wanderers afraid;  \nThe cart must shun the midday sun,  \n  And thus has been delayed.11\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Yesshir,\n\nFasht to my head the heated shun-beam clings;  \nBirds, flying creatures, alsho winged things  \nResht in the branches of the trees, while men,  \nPeople, and pershons shigh and shigh again;  \nAt home they tarry, in their houses shtay,  \nTo bear the heat and burden of the day.12\n\nWell, shir, that shervant isn\'t here yet. I\'m going to shing shomething to\npassh the time. [ _He sings_.] There, shir, did you hear what I shang?\n\n_Courtier_. What shall I say? Ah, how melodious!\n\np. 114\n\nSansth\xc4\x81naka. Why shouldn\'t it be malodorous?\n\nOf nut-grass and cumin I make up a pickle,  \nOf devil\'s-dung, ginger, and orris, and treacle;  \nThat\'s the mixture of perfumes I eagerly eat:  \nWhy shouldn\'t my voice be remarkably shweet?13\n\nWell, shir, I\'m jusht going to shing again. [ _He does so_.] There, shir, did\nyou hear what I shang?\n\n_Courtier_. What shall I say? Ah, how melodious!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Why shouldn\'t it be malodorous?\n\nOf the flesh of the cuckoo I make up a chowder,  \nWith devil\'s-dung added, and black pepper powder;  \nWith oil and with butter I shprinkle the meat:  \nWhy shouldn\'t my voice be remarkably shweet?14\n\nBut shir, the shervant isn\'t here yet.\n\n_Courtier_. Be easy in your mind. He will be here presently.\n\n[ _Enter Vasantasen \xc4\x81 in the bullock-cart, and Sth\xc4\x81varaka_.]\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. I\'m frightened. It is already noon. I hope Sansth\xc4\x81naka, the\nking\'s brother-in-law, will not be angry. I must drive faster. Get up,\nbullocks, get up!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Alas! That is not Vardham\xc4\x81naka\'s voice. What does it mean? I\nwonder if Ch\xc4\x81rudatta was afraid that the bullocks might become weary, and so\nsent another man with another cart. My right eye twitches. My heart is all\na-tremble. There is no one in sight. Everything seems to dance before my eyes.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Hearing the sound of wheels_.] The cart is here, shir.\n\n_Courtier_. How do you know?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Can\'t you shee? It shqueaks like an old hog.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Perceives the cart_.] Quite true. It is here.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Sth\xc4\x81varaka, my little shon, my shlave, are you here?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Yes, sir.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Is the cart here?\n\np. 115\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Yes, sir.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Are the bullocks here?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Yes, sir.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. And are you here?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. [ _Laughing_.] Yes, master, I am here too.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Then drive the cart in.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. By which road?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Right here, where the wall is tumbling down.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Oh, master, the bullocks will be killed. The cart will go to\npieces. And I, your servant, shall be killed.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I\'m the king\'s brother-in-law, man. If the bullocks are\nkilled, I\'ll buy shome more. If the cart goes to pieces, I\'ll have another one\nmade. If you are killed, there will be another driver.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Everything will be replaced\xc2\x97except me.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Let the whole thing go to pieces. Drive in over the wall.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Then break, cart, break with your driver. There will be another\ncart. I must go and present myself to my master. [ _He drives in_.] What! not\nbroken? Master, here is your cart.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. The bullocks not shplit in two? and the ropes not killed? and\nyou too not killed?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. No, sir.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Come, shir. Let\'s look at the cart. You are my teacher, shir,\nmy very besht teacher. You are a man I reshpect, my intimate friend, a man I\ndelight to honor. Do you enter the cart firsht.\n\n_Courtier_. Very well. [ _He starts to do so_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Not much! Shtop! Is thish your father\'s cart, that you should\nenter it firsht? I own thish cart. I\'ll enter it firsht.\n\n_Courtier_. I only did what you said.\n\np. 116\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Even if I do shay sho, you ought to be polite enough to shay\n"After you, mashter."\n\n_Courtier_. After you, then.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Now I\'ll enter. Sth\xc4\x81varaka, my little shon, my shlave, turn\nthe cart around.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. [ _Does so_.] Enter, master.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Enters and looks about, then hastily gets out in terror,\nand falls on the courtier\'s neck_.] Oh, oh, oh! You\'re a dead man! There\'s a\nwitch, or a thief, that\'s sitting and living in my bullock-cart. If it\'s a\nwitch, we\'ll both be robbed. If it\'s a thief, we\'ll both be eaten alive.\n\n_Courtier_. Don\'t be frightened. How could a witch travel in a bullock-cart? I\nhope that the heat of the midday sun has not blinded you, so that you became\nthe victim of an hallucination when you saw the shadow of Sth\xc4\x81varaka with the\nsmock on it.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Sth\xc4\x81varaka, my little shon, my shlave, are you alive?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Yes, sir.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. But shir, there\'s a woman sitting and living in the bullock-\ncart. Look and shee!\n\n_Courtier_. A woman?\n\nThen let us bow our heads at once and go,  \n  Like steers whose eyes the falling raindrops daze;  \nIn public spots my dignity I show;  \n  On high-born dames I hesitate to gaze.15\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _In amazement. Aside_.] Oh, oh! It is that thorn in my eye,\nthe king\'s brother-in-law. Alas! the danger is great. Poor woman! My coming\nhither proves as fruitless as the sowing of a handful of seeds on salty soil.\nWhat shall I do now?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Thish old shervant is afraid and he won\'t look into the cart.\nWill you look into the cart, shir?\n\n_Courtier_. I see no harm in that. Yes, I will do it.\n\np. 117\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Are those things jackals that I shee flying into the air, and\nare those things crows that walk on all fours? While the witch is chewing him\nwith her eyes, and looking at him with her teeth, I\'ll make my eshcape.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Perceives Vasantasen \xc4\x81. Sadly to himself_.] Is it possible? The\ngazelle follows the tiger. Alas!\n\nHer mate is lovely as the autumn moon,  \nWho waits for her upon the sandy dune;  \nAnd yet the swan will leave him? and will go  \nTo dance attendance on a common crow?16\n\n[ _Aside to Vasantasen \xc4\x81_.] Ah, Vasantasen\xc4\x81! This is neither right, nor worthy\nof you.\n\nYour pride rejected him before,  \n  Yet now for gold, and for your mother\'s will\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. No! [ _She shakes her head_.]\n\n_Courtier_.\n\nYour nature knows your pride no more;  \n  You honor him, a common woman still.17\n\nDid I not tell 1 you to "serve the man you love, and him you hate"?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. I made a mistake in the cart, and thus I came hither. I throw\nmyself upon your protection.\n\n_Courtier_. Do not fear. Come, I must deceive him. [ _He returns to Sansth\n\xc4\x81naka_.] Jackass, there is indeed a witch who makes her home in the cart.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. But shir, if a witch is living there, why aren\'t you robbed?\nAnd if it\'s a thief, why aren\'t you eaten alive?\n\n_Courtier_. Why try to determine that? But if we should go back on foot\nthrough the gardens until we came to the city, to Ujjayin\xc4\xab, what harm would\nthat do?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. And if we did, what then?\n\np. 118\n\n_Courtier_. Then we should have some exercise, and should avoid tiring the\nbullocks.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. All right. Sth\xc4\x81varaka, my shlave, drive on. But no! Shtop,\nshtop! I go on foot before gods and Brahmans? Not much! I\'ll go in my cart,\nsho that people shall shee me a long way off, and shay "There he goes, our\nmashter, the king\'s brother-in-law."\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Aside_.] It is hard to convert poison into medicine. So be it,\nthen. [ _Aloud_.] Jackass, this is Vasantasen\xc4\x81, come to visit you.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Heaven forbid!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Gleefully_.] Oh, oh! To visit me, an arishtocrat, a man, a\nregular V\xc4\x81sudeva?\n\n_Courtier_. Yes.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. This is an unheard-of piece of luck. That other time I made\nher angry, sho now I\'ll fall at her feet and beg her pardon.\n\n_Courtier_. Capital!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I\'ll fall at her feet myshelf. [ _He approaches Vasantasen\n\xc4\x81_.] Little mother, mamma dear, lishten to my prayer.\n\nI fold my hands and fall before thy feet\xc2\x97  \nThine eyes are large, thy teeth are clean and neat,  \n  Thy finger-nails are ten\xc2\x97forgive thy shlave  \nWhat, love-tormented, he offended, shweet.18\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Angrily_.] Leave me! Your words are an insult! [ _She\nspurns him with her foot_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Wrathfully_.]\n\nThish head that mother and that mamma kissed,  \nThat never bent to worship god, I wist,  \nUpon thish head she dared to plant her feet,  \nLike jackals on the carrion they meet.19\n\nSth\xc4\x81varaka, you shlave, where did you pick her up?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Master, the highway was blocked by villagers\xc2\x92 wagons. So I\nstopped my cart near Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s orchard, and got out. And\n\np. 119\n\nwhile I was helping a villager with his wagon, I suppose she mistook this cart\nfor another, and climbed in.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Oho! she mishtook my cart for another? and didn\'t come to shee\nme? Get out of my cart, get out! You\'re going to visit your poor merchant\'s\nshon, are you? Those are my bullocks you\'re driving. Get out, get out, you\nshlave! Get out, get out!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Truly, you honor me when you say that I came to see\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta. Now what must be, must be.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. These hands of mine, ten-finger-naily,\n\n  These hands sho lotush-leafy,  \nAre itching-anxious, girl, to daily  \n  With you; and in a jiffy  \nI\'ll drag Your Shweetness by the hair  \n  From the cart wherein you ride,  \nAs did Jat\xc4\x81yu B\xc4\x81li\'s fair,  \n  The monkey B\xc4\x81li\'s bride.20\n\n_Courtier_. So virtuous ladies may not be\n\nInsulted thus despitefully;  \nNor garden creepers may not be  \nRobbed of their leaves so cruelly.21\n\nStand up, man. I will help her to alight. Come, Vasantasen\xc4\x81! [ _Vasantasen \xc4\x81\nalights and stands apart_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Aside_.] The flame of wrath was kindled when she despised\nmy proposition, and now it blazes up because she kicked me. Sho now I\'ll\nmurder her. Good! Thish way. [ _Aloud_.] Well, shir, what do you want?\n\nA cloak with fringes hanging down and all,  \n  Tied with a hundred shtrings? or good ragout,  \nTo make you shmack your greedy lips and call  \n  "Chuhoo, chuhoo, chukku, chuhoo, chuhooo"?22\n\n_Courtier_. Well?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Do me a favor.\n\np. 120\n\n_Courtier_. Certainly. Anything, unless it be a sin.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. There\'s not a shmell of a shin in it, shir. Not a perfume!\n\n_Courtier_. Speak, then.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Murder Vasantasen\xc4\x81.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Stopping his ears_.]\n\nA tender lady, gem of this our city,  \n  A courtezan whose love was stainless ever\xc2\x97  \nIf I should kill her, sinless, without pity,  \n  What boat would bear me on the gloomy river?23\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I\'ll give you a boat. And beshides, in thish deserted garden,\nwho\'ll shee you murdering her?\n\n_Courtier_. The regions ten, 1 the forest gods, the sky,\n\n  The wind, the moon, the sun whose rays are light,  \nVirtue, my conscience\xc2\x97these I cannot fly,  \n  Nor earth, that witnesses to wrong and right.24\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Well then, put your cloak over her and murder her.\n\n_Courtier_. You fool! You scoundrel!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. The old hog is afraid of a shin. Never mind. I\'ll pershuade\nSth\xc4\x81varaka, my shlave. Sth\xc4\x81varaka, my little shon, my shlave, I\'ll give you\ngolden bracelets.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. And I\'ll wear them.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I\'ll have a golden sheat made for you.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. And I\'ll sit on it.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I\'ll give you all my leavings.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. And I\'ll eat them.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I\'ll make you the chief of all my shervants.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Master, I\'ll be the chief.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. You only have to attend to what I shay.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Master, I will do anything, unless it be a sin.\n\np. 121\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. There\'s not a shmell of a shin in it.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Then speak, master.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Murder Vasantasen\xc4\x81.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Oh, master, be merciful! Unworthy as I am, I brought this\nworthy lady hither, because she mistook this bullock-cart for another.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. You shlave, ain\'t I your mashter?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Master of my body, not of my character. Be merciful, master, be\nmerciful! I am afraid.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. You\'re my shlave. Who are you afraid of?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Of the other world, master.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Who is thish "other world"?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Master, it is a rewarder of righteousness and sin.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. What is the reward of righteoushness?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. To be like my master, with plenty of golden ornaments.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. What is the reward of shin?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. To be like me, eating another man\'s bread. That is why I will\ndo no sin.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Sho you won\'t murder her? [He beats him with all his might.]\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. You may beat me, master. You may kill me, master. I will do no\nsin.\n\nA luckless, lifelong slave am I,  \nA slave I live, a slave I die;  \nBut further woe I will not buy,  \n  I will not, will not sin.25\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Sir, I throw myself upon your protection.\n\n_Courtier_. Pardon him, jackass! Well done, Sth\xc4\x81varaka!\n\nDoes this poor, miserable slave  \nSeek virtue\'s meed beyond the grave? p. 122  \nAnd is his lord indifferent?  \nThen why are not such creatures sent  \nTo instant hell, whose sinful store  \nGrows great, who know not virtue more?26\n\nAnd again:\n\nAh, cruel, cruel is our fate,  \nAnd enters through the straitest gate;  \nSince he is slave, and you are lord,  \nSince he does not enjoy your hoard,  \nSince you do not obey his word.27\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Aside_.] The old jackal is afraid of a shin, and the\n"lifelong shlave" is afraid of the other world. Who am I afraid of, I, the\nking\'s brother-in-law, an arishtocrat, a man? [ _Aloud_.] Well, shervant, you\n"lifelong shlave," you can go. Go to your room and resht and keep out of my\nway.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Yes, master. [ _To Vasantasen \xc4\x81_.] Madam, I have no further\npower.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Girds up his loins_.] Wait a minute, Vasantasen\xc4\x81, wait a\nminute. I want to murder you.\n\n_Courtier_. You will kill her before my eyes? [ _He seizes him by the\nthroat_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Falls to the ground_.] Shir, you\'re murdering your mashter.\n[ _He loses consciousness, but recovers_.]\n\nI always fed him fat with meat,  \nAnd gave him butter too, to eat;  \nNow for the friend in need I search;  \nWhy does he leave me in the lurch?28\n\n[ _After reflection_.] Good! I have an idea. The old jackal gave her a hint by\nshaking his head at her. Sho I\'ll shend him away, and then I\'ll murder\nVasantasen\xc4\x81. That\'s the idea. [ _Aloud_.] Shir, I was born in a noble family\nas great as a wine-glass. How could I do that shin I shpoke about? I jusht\nshaid it to make her love me.\n\np. 123\n\n_Courtier_. Why should you boast of this your noble birth?\n\n\xc2\x92Tis character that makes the man of worth;  \nBut thorns and weeds grow rank in fertile earth.29\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. She\'s ashamed to confessh her love when you\'re here. Please\ngo. My shervant Sth\xc4\x81varaka has gone too after getting a beating. He may be\nrunning away. Catch him, shir, and come back with him.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Aside_.]\n\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 is too proud to own,  \nWhile I am near, her love for one so crude;  \nSo now I leave her here with him alone;  \nLove\'s confidences long for solitude.30\n\n[ _Aloud_.] Very well. I go.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Seizing the hem of his garment_.] Did I not throw myself\nupon your protection?\n\n_Courtier_. Do not fear, Vasantasen\xc4\x81. Jackass, Vasantasen\xc4\x81 is a pledge,\ncommitted to your hand.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. All right. Jusht let her be committed to my hand. It\'s a\npledge that I\'ll execute.\n\n_Courtier_. Are you honest?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Honesht.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Takes a few steps_.] No! If I go, the wretch might kill her. I\nwill conceal myself for a moment, and see what he intends to do. [ _He stands\napart_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Good! I\'ll murder her. But no! Perhaps thish tricky\ntrickshter, thish Brahman, thish old jackal, has gone and hidden himshelf; he\nmight raise a howl like the jackal he is. I\'ll jusht do thish to deceive him.\n[ _He gathers flowers and adorns himself_.] Vasantasen\xc4\x81, my love, my love!\nCome!\n\n_Courtier_. Yes, he has turned lover. Good! I am content. I will go.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\np. 124\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I\'ll give you gold, I\'ll call you shweet;\n\nMy turbaned head adores your feet.  \nWhy not love me, my clean-toothed girl?  \nWhy worship such a pauper churl?31\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. How can you ask? [ _She bows her head and recites the\nfollowing verses_.]\n\nO base and vile! O wretch! What more?  \n  Why tempt me now with gold and power?  \nThe honey-loving bees adore  \n  The pure and stainless lotus flower.32\n\nThough poverty may strike a good man low,  \nPeculiar honor waits upon his woe;  \nAnd \xc2\x92tis the glory of a courtezan  \nTo set her love upon an honest man.33\n\nAnd I, who have loved the mango-tree, I cannot cling to the locust-tree.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Wench, you make that poor little Ch\xc4\x81rudatta into a mango-tree,\nand me you call a locusht-tree, not even an acacia! That\'s the way you abuse\nme, and even yet you remember Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Why should I not remember him who dwells in my heart?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Thish very minute I\'m going to shtrangle "him who dwells in\nyour heart," and you too. Shtand shtill, you poor-merchant-man\'s lover!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Oh speak, oh speak again these words that do me honor!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Jusht let poor Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\xc2\x97the shon of a shlave-reshcue you\nnow!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. He would rescue me, if he saw me.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Is he the king of gods? the royal ape?\n\nShon of a nymph? or wears a demon\'s shape? p. 125  \nThe kingly deity of wind and rain?  \nThe offshpring of the P\xc4\x81ndu-princes\xc2\x92 bane?  \nA prophet? or a vulture known afar?  \nA shtatesman? or a beetle? or a shtar?34\n\nBut even if he was, he couldn\'t reshcue you.\n\nAs S\xc4\xabt\xc4\x81 in the Bh\xc4\x81rata  \nWas killed by good old Ch\xc4\x81nakya,  \nSho I intend to throttle thee,  \nAs did Jat\xc4\x81yu Draupad\xc4\xab.35\n\n[ _He raises his arm to strike her_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Mother! where are you? Oh, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta! my heart\'s longing is\nunfulfilled, and now I die! I will scream for help. No! It would bring shame\non Vasantasen\xc4\x81, should she scream for help. Heaven bless Ch\xc4\x81rudatta!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Does the wench shpeak that rashcal\'s name even yet? [ _He\nseizes her by the throat_.] Remember him, wench, remember him!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Heaven bless Ch\xc4\x81rudatta!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Die, wench! [ _He strangles her. Vasantasen \xc4\x81 loses\nconsciousness, and falls motionless_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Gleefully_.]\n\nThish bashketful of shin, thish wench,  \n  Thish foul abode of impudence\xc2\x97  \nShe came to love, she shtayed to blench,  \n  For Death\'s embrace took every sense.  \nBut why boasht I of valorous arms and shtout?  \nShe shimply died because her breath gave out.  \nLike S\xc4\xabt\xc4\x81 in the Bh\xc4\x81rata, she lies.  \nAh, mother mine! how prettily she dies.36\n\nShe would not love me, though I loved the wench;  \n  I shaw the empty garden, set the shnare, p. 126  \nAnd frightened her, and made the poor girl blench.  \nMy brother! Oh, my father! Thish is where  \nYou misshed the shight of heroism shtout;  \nYour brother and your shon here blosshomed out  \nInto a man; like Mother Draupad\xc4\xab,  \nYou were not there, my bravery to shee.37\n\nGood! The old jackal will be here in a minute. I\'ll shtep ashide and wait. [\n_He does so_.]\n\n[ _Enter the courtier, with Sth \xc4\x81varaka_.]\n\n_Courtier_. I have persuaded the servant Sth\xc4\x81varaka to come back, and now I\nwill look for the jackass. [ _He walks about and looks around him_.] But see!\nA tree has fallen by the roadside, and killed a woman in its fall. O cruel!\nHow couldst thou do this deed of shame? And when I see that a woman was slain\nby thy fatal fall, I too am felled to the earth. Truly, my heart\'s fear for\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 was an evil omen. Oh, heaven grant that all may yet be well! [ _He\napproaches Sansth \xc4\x81naka_.] Jackass, I have persuaded your servant Sth\xc4\x81varaka\nto return.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. How do you do, shir? Sth\xc4\x81varaka, my little shon, my shlave,\nhow do you do?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Well, thank you.\n\n_Courtier_. Give me my pledge.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. What pledge?\n\n_Courtier_. Vasantasen\xc4\x81.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. She\'s gone.\n\n_Courtier_. Where?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Right after you.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Doubtfully_.] No, she did not go in that direction.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. In what direction did you go?\n\n_Courtier_. Toward the east.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Well, she went shouth. 1\n\n_Courtier_. So did I.\n\np. 127\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. She went north.\n\n_Courtier_. This is nonsense. My heart is not satisfied. Speak the truth.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I shwear by your head, shir, and my own feet. You may be easy\nin your heart. I murdered her.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Despairingly_.] You really killed her?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. If you don\'t believe my words, then shee the firsht heroic\ndeed of Sansth\xc4\x81naka, the king\'s brother-in-law. [ _He points out the body_.]\n\n_Courtier_. Alas! Ah, woe is me! [ _He falls in a swoon_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Hee, hee! The gentleman is calm enough now!\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Oh, sir! Come to yourself! I am the first murderer, for I\nbrought the bullock-cart hither without looking into it.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Comes to himself. Mournfully_.] Alas, Vasantasen\xc4\x81!\n\nThe stream of courtesy is dried away,  \n  And happiness to her own land doth flee.  \nSweet gem of gems, that knew love\'s gentle play,  \n  Love\'s mart and beauty\'s! Joy of men like me!  \nThy mirth-shored stream, that kind and healing river\xc2\x97  \nAlas! is perished, lost, and gone forever!38\n\n[ _Tearfully_.] Ah, woe is me!\n\nWhat sin is yet to come, or woe,  \n  Now thou hast done this deed of hate?  \nLike sin\'s foul self, hast thou laid low  \n  The sinless goddess of our state.39\n\n[ _Aside_.] Ah! Perhaps the wretch means to lay this sin to my charge. I must\ngo hence. [ _He walks about. Sansth \xc4\x81naka approaches and holds him back_.]\nScoundrel! Touch me not. I have done with you. I go.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Aha! Firsht you murder Vasantasen\xc4\x81, then you abuse me, and now\nwhere will you run to? And sho a man like me hasn\'t anybody to protect him.\n\np. 128\n\n_Courtier_. You are an accursed scoundrel!\n\n_Sansth_. I\'ll give you countless wealth, a piece of gold,\n\nA copper, and a cap, to have and hold.  \nAnd sho the fame of thish great deed shall be  \nA common property, and shan\'t touch me.40\n\n_Courtier_. A curse upon you! Yours, and yours only, be the deed.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Heaven avert the omen! [ _Sansth \xc4\x81naka bursts out laughing_.]\n\n_Courtier_. Be enmity between us! Cease your mirth!\n\nDamned be a friendship that so shames my worth!  \nNever may I set eyes on one so low!  \nI fling you off, an unstrung, broken bow.41\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Don\'t be angry. Come, let\'s go and play in the pond.\n\n_Courtier_. Unstained my life, and yet it seems to me\n\nYour friendship stains, and mocks my sinlessness.  \nYou woman-murderer! How could I be  \nA friend to one whom women ever see  \nWith eyes half-closed in apprehension\'s stress?42\n\n[ _Mournfully_.] Vasantasen\xc4\x81,\n\nWhen thou, sweet maid, art born again,  \nBe not a courtezan reborn,  \nBut in a house which sinless men,  \nAnd virtuous, and good, adorn.43\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Firsht you murder Vasantasen\xc4\x81 in my old garden Pushpakaranda,\nand now where will you run to? Come, defend yourshelf in court before my\nshishter\'s husband! [ _He holds him back_.]\n\n_Courtier_. Enough, you accursed scoundrel! [ _He draws his sword_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Recoiling in terror_.] Shcared, are you? Go along, then.\n\n_Courtier_. [ _Aside_.] It would be folly to remain here. Well, I will go and\njoin myself to Sharvilaka, Chandanaka, and the rest.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\np. 129\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Go to hell. Well, my little shon Sth\xc4\x81varaka, what kind of a\nthing is thish that I\'ve done?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Master, you have committed a terrible crime.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Shlave! What do you mean by talking about a crime? Well, I\'ll\ndo it thish way. [ _He takes various ornaments from his person_.] Take these\ngems. I give \xc2\x92em to you. Whenever I want to wear them, I\'ll take them back\nagain, but the resht of the time they are yours.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. They should be worn only by my master. What have I to do with\nsuch things?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Go along! Take these bullocks, and wait in the tower of my\npalace until I come.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Yes, master.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. The gentleman has made himshelf invisible. He wanted to save\nhimshelf. And the shlave I\'ll put in irons in the palace tower, and keep him\nthere. And sho the shecret will be shafe. I\'ll go along, but firsht I\'ll take\na look at her. Is she dead, or shall I murder her again? [ _He looks at\nVasantasen \xc4\x81_.] Dead as a door-nail! Good! I\'ll cover her with thish cloak.\nNo, it has my name on it. Shome honesht man might recognize it. Well, here are\nshome dry leaves that the wind has blown into a heap. I\'ll cover her with\nthem. [ _He does so, then pauses to reflect_.] Good! I\'ll do it thish way.\nI\'ll go to court at once, and there I\'ll lodge a complaint. I\'ll shay that the\nmerchant Ch\xc4\x81rudatta enticed Vasantasen\xc4\x81 into my old garden Pushpakaranda, and\nkilled her for her money.\n\nYesh, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta musht be shlaughtered now,  \nAnd I\'ll invent the plan, forgetting pity;  \nThe shacrificing of a sinless cow  \nIs cruel in the kindesht-hearted city.44\n\nNow I\'m ready to go. [ _He starts to go away, but perceives something that\nfrightens him_.] Goodnessh gracioush me! Wherever I go, thish damned monk\ncomes with his yellow robes. I bored a hole\n\np. 130\n\nin his nose once and drove him around, and he hates me. Perhaps he\'ll shee me,\nand will tell people that I murdered her. How shall I eshcape? [ _He looks\nabout_.] Aha! I\'ll jump over the wall where it is half fallen down, and\neshcape that way.\n\nI run, I run, I go,  \nIn heaven, on earth below,  \n  In hell, and in Ceylon,  \n  Han\xc5\xabmat\'s peaks upon\xc2\x97  \nLike Indra\'s self, I go.45\n\n[ _Exit_.]\n\n[ _Enter hurriedly the Buddhist monk, ex-shampooer_.]\n\n_Monk_. I\'ve washed these rags of mine. Shall I let them dry on a branch? no,\nthe monkeys would steal them. On the ground? the dust would make them dirty\nagain. Well then, where shall I spread them out to dry? [ _He looks about_.]\nAh, here is a pile of dry leaves which the wind has blown into a heap. I\'ll\nspread them out on that. [ _He does so_.] Buddha be praised! [ _He sits\ndown_.] Now I will repeat a hymn of the faith.\n\nWho slays the Five Men, and the Female Bane,  \n  By whom protection to the Town is given,  \nBy whom the Outcaste impotent is slain,  \n  He cannot fail to enter into heaven. (2)\n\nAfter all, what have I to do with heaven, before I have paid my debt to\nVasantasen\xc4\x81, my sister in Buddha? She bought my freedom for ten gold-pieces\nfrom the gamblers, and since that day I regard myself as her property. [ _He\nlooks about_.] What was that? a sigh that arose from the leaves? It cannot be.\n\nThe heated breezes heat the leaves,  \nThe wetted garment wets the leaves,  \nAnd so, I guess, the scattered leaves  \nCurl up like any other leaves.46\n\n[ _Vasantasen \xc4\x81 begins to recover consciousness, and stretches out her hand_.]\n\np. 131\n\n_Monk_. Ah, there appears a woman\'s hand, adorned with beautiful gems. What! a\nsecond hand? [ _He examines it with the greatest care_.] It seems to me, I\nrecognize this hand. Yes, there is no doubt about it. Surely, this is the hand\nthat saved me. But I must see for myself. [ _He uncovers the body, looks at\nit, and recognizes it_.] It is my sister in Buddha. [ _Vasantasen \xc4\x81 pants for\nwater_.] Ah, she seeks water, and the pond is far away. What shall I do? An\nidea! I will hold this robe over her and let it drip upon her. [ _He does so.\nVasantasen \xc4\x81 recovers consciousness, and raises herself: The monk fans her\nwith his garment_.]\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Who are you, sir?\n\n_Monk_. Has my sister in Buddha forgotten him whose freedom she bought for ten\ngold-pieces?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. I seem to remember, but not just as you say. It were better\nthat I had slept never to waken.\n\n_Monk_. What happened here, sister in Buddha?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Despairingly_.] Nothing but what is fitting\xc2\x97for a\ncourtezan.\n\n_Monk_. Sister in Buddha, support yourself by this creeper 1 that clings to\nthe tree, and rise to your feet. [ _He bends down the creeper. Vasantasen \xc4\x81\ntakes it in her hand, and rises_.]\n\n_Monk_. In yonder monastery dwells one who is my sister in the faith. There\nshall my sister in Buddha be restored before she returns home. You must walk\nvery slowly, sister. [ _He walks about and looks around him_.] Make way, good\npeople, make way! This is a young lady, and I am a monk, yet my conduct is\nabove reproach.\n\nThe man whose hands, whose lips are free from greed,  \nWho curbs his senses, he is man indeed.  \nHe little reeks, if kingdoms fall or stand;  \nFor heaven is in the hollow of his hand.47\n\n[ _Exeunt_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[109:1](lcc14.htm#fr_71) An allusion to the practice by which the Buddhists\ninduced a state of religious ecstasy.\n\n[109:2](lcc14.htm#fr_72) The five senses.\n\n[109:3](lcc14.htm#fr_73) Ignorance.\n\n[109:4](lcc14.htm#fr_74) The body.\n\n[109:5](lcc14.htm#fr_75) The conceit of individuality.\n\n[110:1](lcc14.htm#fr_76) Used as an appetizer.\n\n[110:2](lcc14.htm#fr_77) The elaborate puns of this passage can hardly be\nreproduced in a translation.\n\n[117:1](lcc14.htm#fr_78) See page [13](lcc07.htm#page_13).\n\n[120:1](lcc14.htm#fr_79) The four cardinal points, the four intermediate\npoints, the zenith, and the nadir.\n\n[126:1](lcc14.htm#fr_80) The region of Yama, god of death.\n\n[131:1](lcc14.htm#fr_81) A monk may not touch a woman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act the Ninth: The Trial](lcc15.htm)\n\n'
