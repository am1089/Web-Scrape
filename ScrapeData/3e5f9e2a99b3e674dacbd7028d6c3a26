Having thrown the (earth of the) foot-print (into the pan), he (the\nAdhvaryu) washes his hands. Now as to why he washes his hands;--clarified\nbutter being a thunderbolt, and the Soma being seed, he washes his hands lest\n3 he should injure the seed, Soma, with the thunderbolt, the ghee.\n\n3:3:2:22\\. Thereupon he ties the piece of gold to this (finger 4). Now,\ntwofold indeed is this (universe),--there is no third,--the truth and the\nuntruth: the gods are the truth and men are the untruth. And gold having\nsprung from Agni\'s seed, he ties the gold to this (finger), in order that he\nmay touch the twigs (of the Soma) with the truth, that he may handle the Soma\nby means of the truth.\n\np. 64\n\n3:3:2:33\\. He then orders (the sacrificer\'s men), \'Bring thou the Soma-cloth!\nbring thou the Soma-wrapper! bring thou the head-band!\' Let some shining\n(cloth) be the Soma-cloth; for this is to be his (king Soma\'s 1) garment, and\nshining indeed is his garment: and whosoever serves him with a shining\n(garment), he truly shines. But he who says, \'(Bring) anything whatsoever,\' he\nwill indeed be anything whatsoever: let the Soma-cloth, therefore, be some\nsplendid (cloth), and the Soma-wrapper one of any kind.\n\n3:3:2:44\\. If he can get a head-band, let there be a headband; but if he\ncannot get a head-band, let him cut off from the Soma-wrapper a piece two or\nthree fingers long, to serve as the head-band. Either the Adhvaryu or the\nSacrificer takes the Soma-cloth, and some one or other the Soma-wrapper.\n\n3:3:2:55\\. Now, in the first place, they pick the king (Soma). A pitcher of\nwater is placed close to him, and a Brahman sits beside him 2. Thither they\n(the priests and sacrificer) now proceed eastward.\n\n3:3:2:66\\. While they go there, he (the Adhvaryu) makes\n\np. 65\n\n[paragraph continues] (the sacrificer) say the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 24), \'Say\nthou, for me, unto Soma, "This is thy gayatri-part (bhaga) 1!" Say thou, for\nme, unto Soma, "This is thy trish _t_ ubh-part!" Say thou, for me, unto Soma,\n"This is thy _g_ ayati-part!" Say thou, for me, unto Soma, "Obtain thou the\nsupreme sovereignty of the names of metres!"\' Now, when he (king Soma) is\nbought, he is bought for one (destination 2)--for the sovereignty of the\nmetres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres; and when they press him,\nthey slay him: hereby now he says to him, \'It is for the sovereignty of the\nmetres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres that I buy thee, not for\nslaying thee.\' Having gone there, he sits down (behind the Soma) with his face\ntowards the east.\n\n3:3:2:77\\. He touches (the Soma-plants), with, \'Ours thou art,\'--thereby he\n(Soma), now that he has come (as a guest), becomes as it were one of his (the\nsacrificer\'s) own (people): for this reason he says, \'Ours thou art;\'--\'Thy\npure (juice) is meet for the draught,\' for he will indeed take therefrom the\n\'pure draught 3.\' \'Let the pickers pick thee!\' this he says for the sake of\ncompleteness.\n\n3:3:2:88\\. Now some, on noticing any straw or (piece of) wood (among the Soma-\nplants), throw it away. But let him not do this; for--the Soma being the\nnobility and the other plants the common people, and the\n\np. 66\n\npeople being the nobleman\'s food--it would be just as if one were to take hold\nof and pull out some (food) he has put in his mouth, and throw it away. Hence\nlet him merely touch it, with, \'Let the pickers pick thee!\' Those pickers of\nhis do indeed pick it.\n\n3:3:2:99\\. He then spreads the cloth (over the ox-hide), either twofold or\nfourfold, with the fringe towards the east or north. Thereon he metes out the\nking (Soma); and because he metes out the king, therefore there is a measure,\n--both the measure among men and whatever other measure there is.\n\n3:3:2:1010\\. He metes out, with a verse to Savit _ri_ ; for Savit _ri_ is the\nimpeller of the gods, and so that (Soma) becomes for him impelled by Savit\n_ri_ to the purchase.\n\n3:3:2:1111\\. He metes out with an ati _kh_ andas-verse; for that one, viz. the\nati _kh_ andas 1, embraces all metres; and so that (Soma) is meted out for him\nby means of all the metres: therefore he metes out with an ati _kh_ andas-\nverse.\n\n3:3:2:1212\\. He metes out, with the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 25), \'Unto that\ndivine Savit _ri_ within the two bowls 2, the sage, I sing praises, to him of\ntrue\n\np. 67\n\nimpulse, the bestower of treasures, the wise and thoughtful friend;--he at\nwhose impulse the resplendent light shone high, the golden-handed sage hath\nmeasured the ether with his form.\'\n\n3:3:2:1313\\. Therewith 1 he metes out (the Soma) with all (five fingers),\ntherewith with four, therewith with three, therewith with two, therewith with\none; therewith with one, therewith with two, therewith with three, therewith\nwith four, therewith with all (fingers); having laid (the two hands) together\n2 he throws (Soma) thereon with the joined open hands.\n\n3:3:2:1414\\. He metes out while bending up and bending down (the fingers). The\nreason why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down is that he\nthereby makes those fingers of separate existence, and therefore they are born\nseparate (from each other); and as to his meting out with all (fingers)\ntogether, these (fingers) are to be born, as it were, united. This is why he\nmetes out in bending (the fingers) up and down.\n\n3:3:2:1515\\. And, again, as to his meting out in bending them up and down,--he\nthereby renders them of varied power, and hence these (fingers) are of varied\n\np. 68\n\npower. That is why he metes out in bending them up and down.\n\n3:3:2:1616\\. And, again, as to his meting out in bending them up and down,--he\nthereby harnesses a vira _g_  1 (to ply) thitherwards and hitherwards: going\nthither-wards, namely, it conveys the sacrifice to the gods, and coming\nhitherwards it assists men. This is why he metes out in bending (the fingers)\nup and down.\n\n3:3:2:1717\\. And as to his meting out ten times,--the vira _g_ is of ten\nsyllables, and the Soma is of vira _g_ nature: for this reason he metes out\nten times.\n\n3:3:2:1818\\. Having gathered up the ends of the Soma-cloth, he (the Adhvaryu)\nties them together by means of the head-band, with, \'For descendants (I tie)\nthee;\'--for it is indeed for (the purpose of obtaining) descendants that he\nbuys it (Soma): what (part of man) here is, as it were, compressed between the\nhead and the shoulders, that he thereby makes it to be for him (the\nsacrificer) 2.\n\n3:3:2:1919\\. He then makes a finger-hole in the middle (of the knot), with the\ntext, \'Let the descendants breathe after thee!\' For, in compressing (the\ncloth), he, as it were, strangles him (Soma and the sacrificer) and renders\nhim breathless; hereby now he emits his breath from inside, and after him\nbreathing the descendants also breathe: for this reason he says, \'Let the\ndescendants breathe after thee.\' Thereupon he hands him (Soma) to the Soma-\nseller. Now, then, of the bargain.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[63:3](sbe2612.htm#fr_173) The construction in the original is as usual in the\noratio directa.\n\n[63:4](sbe2612.htm#fr_174) Viz. to the nameless (or ring) finger. Katy. VII,\n6, 27.\n\n[64:1](sbe2612.htm#fr_175) I do not think \'asya\' could refer to the\nsacrificer, in opposition to \'etasya\' (Soma); nor can the latter be construed\nwith the following relative clause \'sa yo . . .\' The Ka _n_ va text reads, Tad\nyad eva _s_ obhanatama _m_ tat somopanahana _m_ syad, vaso by asyaitad\nbhavati; sa yo haita _k_ _kh_ obhanatama _m_ kurute, _s_ obhate haiva sa _h_ ,\n&c.\n\n[64:2](sbe2612.htm#fr_176) The Pratiprasthat _ri_ , in the first place, takes\nthe Soma-plants (from the seller) and puts them on an ox-hide, dyed red and\nspread on the ground at the place (in the east of the hall) where the\n\'sounding-holes\' will be dug (see [III, 5, 4, 1](sbe2622.htm#3:5:4:1) seq.).\nThe seller of the Soma, who is to be either of the Kutsa tribe or a _S_ udra,\nthen picks the Soma, breaking the plants at the joints. A jar filled with\nwater is placed in front of the Soma, and a Brahman (or the assistant of the\nBrahman, viz. the Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin) sits down by the (right or\nsouth) side of the Soma. Katy. VII, 6, 1-6.\n\n[65:1](sbe2612.htm#fr_177) The three parts refer to the three Savanas, at\nwhich the respective metres are used. See [IV, 3, 2, 7](sbe2651.htm#4:3:2:7)\nseq.\n\n[65:2](sbe2612.htm#fr_178) Bhagam appears to have been lost here, since a play\non that word seems to be intended, which might perhaps be reproduced by lot.\'\nIt is given both at the Ka _n_ va text and at [III, 4, 1,\n7](sbe2615.htm#3:4:1:7).\n\n[65:3](sbe2612.htm#fr_179) For the _S_ ukra-graha, see [IV, 2, 1,\n1](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:1) seq.\n\n[66:1](sbe2612.htm#fr_180) Ati _kh_ andas (\'over-metre\') is the generic name\nfor the metres which number more than forty-eight syllables: hence it is said\nto include all the other metres which consist of fewer syllables. See VIII, 6,\n2, 23, where the term is explained by atti- _kh_ anda _h_ (metre-eater).\'\n\n[66:2](sbe2612.htm#fr_181) Or, that divine invigorator of the two \'o _n_ i.\'\nAccording to the St. Petersb. Dict., \'o _n_ i\' would seem to refer to two\nparts of the Soma-press. Professor Ludwig takes it to mean \'press-arm\' and the\n\'arm\' generally, which suits very well some of the passages in which the word\noccurs. Here, in the loc. or gen. case, it can scarcely mean \'arms\' (though\nSavit _ri_ \'s two arms are often referred to as dispelling the darkness and\nkeeping asunder the spaces, cf. Rig-veda II, 38, 2; IV, 53, 3; 4; VI, 75, 1;\n5; VII, 45, 2), but apparently refers to \'heaven and earth\' being thus\nequivalent to p. 67 the two _k_ amu (originally the two receptacles or bowls\ninto which the pressed Soma flows) in Rig-veda III, 55, 20.\n\n[67:1](sbe2612.htm#fr_182) Viz. with the same formula, repeating it each time.\nThe meting out of the Soma is done with the fingers of the right hand, first\nwith all five, and then successively turning in one (beginning with the\nthumb), till the little finger remains with which he takes Soma twice,\nwhereupon he again successively releases the fingers.\n\n[67:2](sbe2612.htm#fr_183) There is some doubt as to whether this refers to\nthe preceding \'with all (viz. ten fingers);\' or whether he is to take for the\ntenth time some Soma with the five fingers of the right hand, and then once\nmore (without muttering the text) with the joined hands. See Katy. VII, 7, 18,\n29. The text seems to be purposely vague.\n\n[68:1](sbe2612.htm#fr_184) The vira _g_ (the shining\' or \'ruling\' metre)\nconsists of (generally three or four) padas of ten syllables each: hence it is\nhere connected with the ten metings out of Soma.\n\n[68:2](sbe2612.htm#fr_185) The Soma representing offspring, he gives the\nbundle a shape resembling the human body.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 3.
