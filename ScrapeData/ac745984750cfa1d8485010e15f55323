And Scripture teaches the joining of this (i.e. the individual soul) with\nthat (i.e. bliss) in that (i.e. the anandamaya).\n\n'A flavour he is indeed; having obtained a flavour this one enjoys bliss'\n(Taitt. Up. II, 7). This text declares that this one, i.e. the so-called\nindividual soul, enjoys bliss through obtaining the anandamaya, here called\n'flavour.' Now to say that any one is identical with that by obtaining which\nhe enjoys bliss, would be madness indeed.--It being thus ascertained that the\nSelf of bliss is the highest Brahman, we conclude that in passages such as 'if\nthat bliss were not in the ether' (Taitt. Up. II, 7). and 'knowledge, bliss is\nBrahman' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 28), the word 'ananda' denotes the 'anandamaya';\njust as vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana means the vi _g \xc3\xb1_anamaya. It is for the same reason (viz.\nof ananda meaning the same as anandamaya) that the clause 'he who knows the\nbliss of Brahman' exhibits Brahman as being connected\n\np. 237\n\nwith ananda, and that the further clause 'he who knows this reaches the Self\nof bliss,' declares the reaching of the Self of bliss to be the fruit of the\nknowledge of bliss. In the subsequent anuvaka also, in the clauses 'he\nperceived that food is Brahman,' 'he perceived that breath is Brahman,' &c.\n(III, i; 2, &c.), the words 'food,' 'breath,' and so on, are meant to suggest\nthe Self made of food, the Self made of breath, &c., mentioned in the\npreceding anuvaka; and hence also in the clause 'he perceived that bliss is\nBrahman,' the word 'bliss' must be understood to denote the Self of bliss.\nHence, in the same anuvaka, the account of the fate after death of the man who\nknows concludes with the words 'having reached the Self of bliss' (III, 10,5).\nIt is thus finally proved that the highest Brahman--which in the previous\nadhikara _n_ a had to be shown to be other than the so-called Pradhana--is\nalso other than the being called individual soul.--This concludes the topic of\nthe anandamaya.\n\nA new doubt here presents itself.--It must indeed be admitted that such\nindividual souls as possess only a moderate degree of merit are unable to\naccomplish the creation of the world by their mere wish, to enjoy supreme\nbliss, to be the cause of fearlessness, and so on; but why should not beings\nlike \xc3\x82ditya and Pra _g_ apati, whose merit is extraordinarily great, be\ncapable of all this?--Of this suggestion the next Sutra disposes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 21.
