Narada said :-- O Deva! The rules of Sadachara (right ways of living) and\nthe all-sin-destroying unequalled Glories of the Devi Bhagavati have been\ndescribed by Thee. And I, too, have heard the nectar of the Glories of the\nDevi from Thy lotus mouth. The Chandraya _n_ a and other Vratas; described by\nThee, are very difficult to practise. So they are impracticable with the\nordinary persons. Therefore, O Lord! Kindly describe those actions which can\neasily be carried out by common persons, at the same time, the Devi's Grace\nand Siddhis can be obtained by those practices. Again what thou hast described\nabout the Gayatri in connection with Sadachara kindly say which are the chief\nand foremost as well as those that are more meritorious. O Best of the Munis!\nThou hast told that there are the twenty-four syllables in the Gayatri. Kindly\ndescribe now their Ri _s_ is, Chhandas, Devatas and other things that should\nbe known regarding them and thus satisfy my longings.\n\n\n\n8-27. S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! The twice-born would have done what\nthey ought to do if they be engaged in repeating their Gayatri only, whether\nthey be able or not able to practise the Chandraya _n_ a and the other vratas.\nWhichever Brahmi _n_ repeats the Gayatri three thousand times and offers\nArghya to the Sun in the three Sandhya times, the Devas worship him; what to\nspeak of other ordinary persons! Whether he practises Nyasa or not, if anybody\nsincerely repeats the Gayatri Devi, Whose Nature is Existence, Intelligence,\nand Bliss and meditates on Her, even if he attains siddhi in one syllable\neven, then as a result of that, he can vie with the best of the Brahma _n_ as,\nthe Moon, and the Sun; nay, with Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahes'vara even! O\nNarada! Now I will tell in due order the Ri _s_ is, Chhandas, and the Devatas\nof the twenty-four syllables of the Gayatri. The Ri _s_ is, in due order, are\n(1) Vama Deva, (2) Attri, (3) Vas'i _st_ ha, (4) S\xc2\x92ukra, (5) Ka _n_ va, (6)\nParas'ara, (7) the very fiery Vis'vamitra, (8) Kapila, (9) S\xc2\x92au _n_ aka, (10)\nYaj\xc3\xb1avalkya, (11) Bharadvaja, (12) the ascetic Jamadagni, (13) Gautama, (14)\nMudgala, (15) Vedavyasa, (16) Lomas'a, (17) Agastya, (18) Kaus'ika, (19)\nVatsya, (20) Pulastya, (21) Ma _nd_ uka, (22) the ascetic in chief Durvasa,\n(23) Narada and (24) Kas'yapa.\n\n\n\np. 1140\n\n\n\nNow about the chhandas :-- (1) Gayatri, (2) U _sn_ ik, (3) Anu _st_ up, (4)\nBrihati, (5) Pankti, (6) Tri _sn_ up, (7) Jagati, (8) Atijagati, (9) S\xc2\x92akkari,\n(10) Ati S\xc2\x92akkari, (11) Dhriti, (12) Ati Dhriti, (13) Vira _t_ , (14)\nPrastarapankti, (15) K _r_ iti, (16) Prakriti, (17) \xc3\x82kriti, (18) Vik _r_ iti,\n(19) Samk _r_ iti, (20) Ak _s_ arapankti, (21) Bhu _h_ , (22) Bhuva _h_ , (23)\nSva _h_ and (24) Jyoti _s_ mati. The Devatas of the several letters in due\norder, are :-- (1) Agni, (2) Prajapati, (3) Soma, (4) \xc3\x8es'ana, (5) Savita, (6)\n\xc3\x82ditya, (7) Brihaspati, (8) Maitravaru _n_ a, (9) Bhagadeva, (10) Aryama, (11)\nGa _n_ es'a, (12) Tva _st_ ra, (13) Pu _s_ a, (14) Indragni, (l5) Vayu, (16)\nVamadeva, (17) Maitra varuni (18) Vis'vadeva, (19) Matrika, (20) Vi _sn_ u,\n(21) Vasu, (22) Rudra Deva, (23) Kuvera, and (24) the twin As'vini Kumaras. O\nNarada! Thus I have described to you about the the Devatas of the twenty-four\nsyllables. The hearing of this destroys all sins and yields the full results\nof repeating the mantra Gayatri. (Note :-- The Devatas, mentioned in the\nGayatri Brahma Kalpa are different from those mentioned here.)\n\n\n\nHere ends the first Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the description of Gayatri\nin the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk12ch02.htm)\n\n"
