There wood has been put on the (nuptial) fire.\n\n3. 3 To the west of the fire a red bull's hide has been spread out, with the neck to the east and with the hair outside.\n\n4\\. On that they make the woman, who has to keep silence, sit down.\n\n5\\. And (there) she remains sitting until the stars appear.\n\n6\\. When (somebody) has said that a star has appeared, (the husband)\nsacrifices six oblations of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya with the (six verses) commencing with\n(the verse), 'In the junctions of the lines' (l.l. I, 3, 1-6).\n\n7\\. The remnants of each oblation he should pour out over the bride's head.\n\n8\\. After the sacrifice they arise, go out (of the house), and he shows her\nthe 'firm star' (i.e. the polar-star).\n\np. 48\n\n9\\. (Repeating the formula): 'Firm art thou. May I, N.N., become firm in the\nhouse of N.N., my husband'\xc2\x97she should pronounce her husband's and her own\nname.\n\n10. 10 And (he shows her besides the star) Arundhati.\n\n11. 11 (She says): 'I (N.N.) am held fast,' &c., as above (Sutra 9).\n\n12\\. He then addresses her with the verse, 'Firm is the sky' (MB. I, 3, 7).\n\n13. 13 After she has been addressed (thus), she respectfully calls her Guru by his Gotra name.\n\n14. 14 Thus she breaks her silence.\n\n15\\. From that time through a period of three nights they should both avoid\neating saline or pungent food, and should sleep together on the ground without\nhaving conjugal intercourse.\n\n16. 16 Here, they say, an Argha reception (should be offered to the young husband).\n\n17\\. Some say (that this reception should be offered) when (the bridegroom and\nhis companions) have arrived (at the house of the bride's father).\n\n18. 18 The first food which he eats, should be food\n\np. 49\n\nfit for sacrifice, over which he has murmured (the verses quoted in Sutra 21).\n\n19\\. Or he should prepare on the following day a mess of cooked food, of which\nthey eat together.\n\n20\\. The deities to whom it belongs, are, Agni, Pra _g_ apati, the Vi _s_ ve\ndevas, and Anumati.\n\n21\\. Having taken that food out (of the vessel in which it is), and having\nspread it out, he should touch one part of it with his hand, with (the\nverses), 'With the tie of food, with the jewel' (MB. I, 3, 8-10).\n\n22. 22 After he has eaten, and has given the rest to the wife, (they may do) what they like.\n\n23. 23 A cow is the sacrificial fee.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[47:1](sbe30015.htm#fr_202) 3, 1 seqq.
