Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Scandinavia spring to our minds as the words\nare heard. The syllables seem haunted to this day by the dryads that the Greek\nmind saw in every tree. They carry us back to the age of the nymphs who made\ntheir home in pools and seas. There was a time when nature seemed to man but\nas the garment of some large sweet presence that lived and breathed within it.\nAlas, that age is gone. Irish elder and quicken still point to the\nneighbourhood of the Neolithic doorsill, but no longer are they held to guard\nthe village with their mysterious benedictions. The olive yields, as of old,\nthe sacred berries and the oil, but Athene has fled from the hearts where she\nmade her home. Only in India the ancient thought lives on. Here, still, the\nwomen hush their voices and bow their heads as they pass before the tree of\nhealing called the _neem_. Here, still, the earth at its foot forms a rude\naltar, and a\n\np. 130\n\nprotruding fragment of pointed stone, unchiselled, stands as the symbol of\nthat great mother of all, whose golden-green home is the sunny spot beneath\nthe boughs.\n\nIf we take as our standard, not the rigid classifications that appeal to the\nbotanist, but those visible affinities that stir popular recognition, we shall\nprobably feel that the _neem_ \\--with its fern-like leaves, its feathery\nbranches of small golden-green fruits, its wide-spreading roots, and gnarled\nand slender growth--is but the tropical equivalent for the ash of Northern\nEurope, or the olive of the Mediterranean. Some of us may have been puzzled to\naccount for the prominence of the ash in Celtic, and still more in Norse,\nmythology. Why should the Scandinavian Yggdrasil, tree of eternity, have been\nan ash, with its roots in the past, its stem in the present, and its crown of\nleafage in the future? Why should the first man, Askr, have been born of it?\nThe ash is not so plentiful as to account for this. It forms no forests in the\nlands where it is sacred, like the beech or oak. Just as we know that the men\nwho taught to their children the dream of Asgard had come to the north along\nthe old trade-routes from the beautiful cities of Asia, Nineveh, and Babylon,\nwith all their wealth, luxury, and refinement, so also we cannot resist the\nconclusion that the ash derived its importance\n\np. 131\n\nfrom their recognition of it as a tree with which, elsewhere, they had been\nfamiliar. This argument cannot, of course, be complete until some intermediate\ntree is discovered in Persia, and its folk-lore noted and studied. For the ash\nwas especially associated in Europe with the Age of Bronze, bringing in the\nhorse and his sacrifice, and the key to this as a state ceremonial can only be\nsought in Mesopotamia--with the crossings of the highways that made Nineveh\nand Babylon--and in neighbouring districts of Persia and Asia Minor. If\nMohammedanism in those countries is anything like what it is in India, or if\nits action has been at all like that of Buddhism in the farther East, it must\nhave preserved a great deal amongst the lower orders of society that could\nnever claim recognition from the higher; and much still remains to be\ndiscovered regarding the connection between the worship of the sun, to whom\nthe horse was always sacrificed, and some particular sacred tree. A trace of\nthis connection lingers still amongst the Kayasths of Bengal, who will not\ngather the leaves or twigs of the _neem_ on Sunday, because it and the cow,\nthey say, had their birth on the sun's day; and there are people who, though\nthey worship the great Mother, do not associate her presence particularly with\nthe _neem_ except in her specialised form of Sitola Devi.\n\nWonderful properties of nourishment and healing\n\np. 132\n\nbelong to this, the Indian ash. Its leaves are used for medicine and for food.\nA man may actually live on a handful of them eaten daily, and with milk they\nmake an abundant and satisfying diet. The acrid berries, like tiny olives,\nprovide lamp-oil and unguents for the very poor. Even the winds that blow\nthrough it are laden with soothing and with health, so that an old custom in\nCalcutta plants a _neem_ tree on the east of the house, that the fever-breeze\nmay be robbed of its poison ere it reaches the homestead and touches the\nbeloved. And on both sides of the old Mahratta Ditch that once enclosed the\ncity, the Circular Road as it is now, we may still trace an old avenue of\n_neem_ trees--for is not the city the home of its children? And last of all,\nwhen the tree of healing grows old there sometimes breaks from its heart, it\nis said, the silver-white stream of the _neem_ milk. This gushes out,\nintermittently, for months together, and people flock from all over the\ncountryside to see the sight. Every drop of the precious fluid is gathered up\nand preserved for the healing of disease, and whole generations after talk of\nthe miraculous spring.\n\nOut of the very night of time, from long before the dawn of history, come some\nof these most familiar associations of the Indian folk. There are two or three\nsacred trees, all of them undoubtedly\n\np. 133\n\nvery ancient. Low-caste Mohammedan women make offerings to the spirit, of\nhealing that dwells in the _bo_ , or _aswattha_ , the sacred tree of Buddhist\ntimes. This may be a remnant of long pre-Buddhist worship, or it may be only\nanother exemplification of the universal law that Islam in India followed\ndirectly in the footsteps of Buddhism. In Orissa again, and Chota Nagpur, and\nsome districts north of Benares, a like worship is paid by certain strictly\naboriginal castes to the _palash_ tree-- _Butea frondosa_ \\--with its scarlet\nplume-like flowers, borne on naked boughs. Under this tree, it is said, there\nused to be offered the dread agricultural rite of human sacrifice to Miri-\nAmma, the Earth-Mother. It gave its name, again, to the people who dwelt, in\nthe days of Buddha, to the east of Pataliputra, against whom Ajatasatru built\nthe fortress that was afterwards to become the seat of empire. The castes that\nstill pay reverence to the _palash_ , associating with it the name of Miri,\nrepresent doubtless this ancient people, the Palasii of Megasthenes.\n\nStill vaster is the antiquity that stands revealed in the universal\nassociation of these trees with feminine divinities. It is true enough, as\nsome have maintained, that the drama of nature is the subject-matter of all\nmythology, and that therefore, by tracing out the unity of myths, we ought to\nbe\n\np. 134\n\nable to disentangle the great primitive spectacle fundamental to all. But into\nhis interpretation of this drama man could not fail to import conceptions\nderived from the social forms about him and from the problems that seemed to\nhim the most important. Hence, by studying the differentiation of myths we may\nhope to discover something of the periods and races in which they were\nevolved. When Egypt had scarcely begun to make bricks, and Babylon as yet was\nbut a village, already, it may be, the Dravidian hamlets of the south of India\nhad received their consecration from the neighbourhood of the chosen block of\nunhewn stone outside their boundary, that remains to this day as the altar-\nplace of Amma, the Infinite Mother. And only a palaeolithic age, one imagines,\ncould have suggested, as the ideal symbol, the low sharp-pointed cone of\nunchiselled rock that is worshipped still beneath the _neem_. But if this is\nso, we have in that very fact some indication of the earliest of human\nsociological developments. In the present age we instinctively ascribe to\ndeity the aspect of masculinity. This is because our society is patriarchal\nand man dominant. There was an age, however, when woman alone was the\nsteadfast unit; when marriage was an affair of an hour, and the child belonged\nto his mother's village; when all the men of that village were her brothers,\nthe _mamas_ ,\n\np. 135\n\nand natural defenders of her children; when marriage was only lawful between\nmen and women of different villages; and when woman was the obvious head and\ngovernor of the whole. On such a society, raised to the highest point of\norganisation and efficiency, were based the origins of the ancient Egyptian\nmonarchy, the government of Babylon, and the present royal family of\nTravancore in Southern India. In such a society, moreover, it was as natural\nto call God _She_ , as it seems now to us to do the very opposite. Grey-haired\nwomen, full of strange lore about beasts and herbs, with deep wise eyes and\ngentle sovereignty of manners, were its ideal. Such were the Norns, the three\ngrey Fates, who watered the ash-tree Yggdrasil night and morning with water\ndrawn from the Ocean of Memory, turning all that it touched to snowy\nwhiteness. Yet Yggdrasil was of a later age than the Indian _neem_ , for one\nof its mighty roots was fixed in heaven, beneath the throne of \xc3\x86sir, the Great\nGod, where he and the Norns held court and judged the world. We have here the\nmyth of a day when man has made himself king, and woman already stands\nsubordinated.\n\nThe worship of the _neem_ has its centre in Oude and Behar, the ancient Kosala\nand Magadha. From this it spreads north and south, to the deserts of Sind and\nthe Dekkan. I have even seen it in\n\np. 136\n\nthe extreme south, in a beautiful glen near Salem. There the tree stood, in a\nsacred enclosure, shut in by a massive wall of grey stone some five or six\nfeet in height. Under it a pot was buried, bottom upwards, making a dome-\nshaped object, and here and there around the little court were tiny boat-\nshaped lamps for ceremonial lighting. In Sind they go to great trouble and\nexpense, it is said, to obtain the blessed tree, and plant it beside some well\nin the desert country, there to become the nucleus of a small artificial\noasis. Only in East Bengal can I find no trace of its worship except as the\nhome of Sitola Devi. The _aswattha_ there surpasses it in sanctity, and\nservants from that country have a notion that it is haunted; and to see the\nspirit that dwells in it they hold a sign of approaching death.\n\nAnother proof of the great age of the _neem_ as a sacred tree lies in the\nmanner of the worship that is offered by women. It is common, in later\nHinduism, to perform the ceremony of _pradakshina_ , or circumambulation, as\nan act of reverence, and this is what we might have expected to find in the\nworship of a tree. But it is not what happens. Before the _neem_ stands its\nfragment of rude stone, and in parts of the country where this vividly\nsuggests the presence of the All-Mother, high-caste women go in bands, on\ncertain moonlight nights, to offer the lights and sandal-paste,\n\np. 137\n\nthe sweetmeats and libations of milk, that constitute the necessary offerings.\nWhen this has been done they make themselves into a ring, and go round and\nround--not the stone, and not the tree, but--a handful of fire, on which\nincense is thrown, standing in front of the sacred stone. As they go they sing\nmarriage-songs, mentally praying, probably, for the birth of children, and\nfinally the party breaks into groups for the enjoyment of games, romping and\nsinging. We have here a trace of those primitive seasonal dances that were the\ncommunal form of marriage. We have also a hint of how early the witness of the\nfire was invoked as essential to marriage. How far may we trust this\nsuggestion as to the order of emergence of the great religious motives, such\nas fire, planets, earth, and the rest?\n\nThe _neem_ may be worshipped at any time, by a woman who has first served the\ncommunity to the extent of feeding ten beggars. But its greatest festivals\noccur on the moonlight nights of _Sravan_ and _Bhadra_ , August and September.\nThe ceremony of _Tij_ takes place on the third night of the new moon of\n_Sravan_ , or August. On this day, it is considered extremely auspicious that\nyoung married women should receive gifts of clothes, jewels, or sweetmeats\nfrom their husband's mothers. When the presents arrive, the girl calls her\nfriends and companions, and they go out into the moonlight,\n\np. 138\n\nto bathe, put on the new possessions, worship at the feet of the _neem_ , and\nthen spend hours in free and boisterous merriment. On these occasions it is\nstrictly correct to be accompanied by the boys and young men of their own\nvillage, and to he joined by them in the games which follow. Nor is this\ndifficult to understand, for the night represents a return to the old\nfestivities of the communal wedding, when the men of a girl's own village were\nregarded as her brothers and the idea of marriage with one of them could not\noccur. Here we have the equivalent of the May-Day games of Europe, and even\nthe idea, spread by the Church, that May is an unlucky month for marriage,\nstands accounted for in the desire to extinguish heathen rites.\n\nIt was, as Hewitt has pointed out, this same age that gave to the position of\nthe _mama_ , or mother's brother, the strength which it still holds in Hindu\nsociety. He is essential at weddings, and it is he who must give the baby its\nfirst rice when six months old, thus accepting it as lawfully born of his own\nkindred. But the millenniums that have rolled by since the communal marriages\nof the matriarchate are shown in the fact that to perform this ceremony the\nmother's brother must now come to the house of the child's father.\n\nIn the memory of communal marriages, then, before the tree of the Great\nMother, may lie the\n\np. 139\n\nexplanation of the Norse belief that Askr, the first man, was born of the ash.\nThe choice of the months for these marriages was obviously dictated by the\nIndian climate, requiring that children should be born in the heat of the\nyear, when the granaries would be full and the need of labour least. Even now,\nit is doubtless for the birth of sons that wives and mothers pray before the\n_neem_. For how many thousands of years have they sanctified their own\nbrooding love in such spots, beneath the growing moon, ere the All-Mother has\nsent to the house a new man-child!\n\nTo the threshold of history we are carried back by this worship of the _neem_.\nIt is night, the time that to primitive man was fraught with coolness and joy\nand formed the basis of all time-reckoning. About us sleep the southern\nforests. Long ago, if it was ever set there, the dim light has burned out\nbefore the stone at the foot of the sacred tree. Man is still a hunting\nanimal, contending with hairier beasts for his simple home. A few rude stone\nimplements, a little sun-dried pottery, and the struggling crops of half-wild\nrice, are all his possessions. Has he yet found fire? If so, for lamp-oil, as\nwell as for medicine, he must still come to the sacred tree. Even his marriage\nis not yet his own: he knows only his sisters' children. Yet already here, in\nIndia, human society has been born. Already the lawful and\n\np. 140\n\nlawless have been distinguished. Already the thought of enfolding Power has\nemerged. Already the sweetness of motherhood has been named. Already, in the\nsanctification of boundaries, the civic thought is born. Already the stone\nbefore the holy tree indicates a Presence the touch of whose feet makes\nsanctuary. Ages will go by, and man will long dream that the world is\nunchanging, ere these great movements will begin--north, east, and west--by\nwhich in the future nations and civilisations are to be made. Strange, that\neven now thoughts should have been conceived and expressed which will never be\nforgotten so long as man endures. Athene with her olive, and the Norns of the\nash tree Yggdrasil are even now predestined to their place in human history,\nalready in the forests of the Dekkan, in this the Palaeolithic Age.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Dread Seven](seh24.htm)\n\n"
