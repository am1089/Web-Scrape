But that, it may be\nurged, is an impossible task for man to achieve. If this extension of\nconsciousness be an outward process, then it is endless; it is like attempting\nto cross the ocean after ladling out its water. By beginning to try to realise\nall, one has to end by realising nothing.\n\nBut, in reality, it is not so absurd as it sounds. Man has every day to solve\nthis problem of enlarging his region and adjusting his burdens. His burdens\nare many, too numerous for him to carry, but he knows that by adopting a\nsystem he can lighten the weight of his load. Whenever they feel too\ncomplicated and unwieldy, he knows it is because he has not been able to hit\nupon the system which would have set everything in place and distributed the\nweight evenly. This search for system is really a search for unity, for\nsynthesis; it is our attempt to harmonise the heterogeneous complexity of\noutward materials by an inner adjustment. In the search we gradually become\naware that to find out the One is to possess the All; that there, indeed, is\nour last and highest privilege. It is based on the law of that unity which is,\nif we only know it, our abiding strength. Its living principle is the power\nthat is in truth; the truth of that unity which comprehends multiplicity.\nFacts are many, but the truth is one. The animal intelligence knows facts, the\nhuman mind has power to apprehend truth. The apple falls from the tree, the\nrain descends upon the earth--you can go on burdening your memory with such\nfacts and never come to an end. But once you get hold of the law of\ngravitation you can dispense with the necessity of collecting facts _ad\ninfinitum_. You have got at one truth which governs numberless facts. This\ndiscovery of truth is pure joy to man--it is a liberation of his mind. For, a\nmere fact is like a blind lane, it leads only to itself--it has no beyond. But\na truth opens up a whole horizon, it leads us to the infinite. That is the\nreason why, when a man like Darwin discovers some simple general truth about\nBiology, it does not stop there, but like a lamp shedding its light far beyond\nthe object for which it was lighted, it illumines the whole region of human\nlife and thought, transcending its original purpose. Thus we find that truth,\nwhile investing all facts, is not a mere aggregate of facts--it surpasses them\non all sides and points to the infinite reality.\n\nAs in the region of knowledge so in that of consciousness, man must clearly\nrealise some central truth which will give him an outlook over the widest\npossible field. And that is the object which the Upanishad has in view when it\nsays, _Know thine own Soul_. Or, in other words, realise the one great\nprincipal of unity that there is in every man.\n\nAll our egoistic impulses, our selfish desires, obscure our true vision of the\nsoul. For they only indicate our own narrow self. When we are conscious of our\nsoul, we perceive the inner being that transcends our ego and has its deeper\naffinity with the All.\n\nChildren, when they begin to learn each separate letter of the alphabet, find\nno pleasure in it, because they miss the real purpose of the lesson; in fact,\nwhile letters claim our attention only in themselves and as isolated things,\nthey fatigue us. They become a source of joy to us only when they combine into\nwords and sentences and convey an idea.\n\nLikewise, our soul when detached and imprisoned within the narrow limits of a\nself loses its significance. For its very essence is unity. It can only find\nout its truth by unifying itself with others, and only then it has its joy.\nMan was troubled and he lived in a state of fear so long as he had not\ndiscovered the uniformity of law in nature; till then the world was alien to\nhim. The law that he discovered is nothing but the perception of harmony that\nprevails between reason which is of the soul of man and the workings of the\nworld. This is the bond of union through which man is related to the world in\nwhich he lives, and he feels an exceeding joy when he finds this out, for then\nhe realises himself in his surroundings. To understand anything is to find in\nit something which is our own, and it is the discovery of ourselves outside us\nwhich makes us glad. This relation of understanding is partial, but the\nrelation of love is complete. In love the sense of difference is obliterated\nand the human soul fulfils its purpose in perfection, transcending the limits\nof itself and reaching across the threshold of the infinite. Therefore love is\nthe highest bliss that man can attain to, for through it alone he truly knows\nthat he is more than himself, and that he is at one with the All.\n\nThis principal of unity which man has in his soul is ever active, establishing\nrelations far and wide through literature, art, and science, society,\nstatecraft, and religion. Our great Revealers are they who make manifest the\ntrue meaning of the soul by giving up self for the love of mankind. They face\ncalumny and persecution, deprivation and death in their service of love. They\nlive the life of the soul, not of the self, and thus they prove to us the\nultimate truth of humanity. We call them _Mah \xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81s,_ "the men of the great\nsoul."\n\nIt is said in one of the Upanishads: _It is not that thou lovest thy son\nbecause thou desirest him, but thou lovest thy son because thou desirest thine\nown soul._  20 The meaning of this is, that whomsoever we love, in him we find\nour own soul in the highest sense. The final truth of our existence lies in\nthis. _Param \xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81_, the supreme soul, is in me, as well as in my son, and my\njoy in my son is the realisation of this truth. It has become quite a\ncommonplace fact, yet it is wonderful to think upon, that the joys and sorrows\nof our loved ones are joys and sorrows to us--nay they are more. Why so?\nBecause in them we have grown larger, in them we have touched that great truth\nwhich comprehends the whole universe.\n\nIt very often happens that our love for our children, our friends, or other\nloved ones, debars us from the further realisation of our soul. It enlarges\nour scope of consciousness, no doubt, yet it sets a limit to its freest\nexpansion. Nevertheless, it is the first step, and all the wonder lies in this\nfirst step itself. It shows to us the true nature of our soul. From it we\nknow, for certain, that our highest joy is in the losing of our egoistic self\nand in the uniting with others. This love gives us a new power and insight and\nbeauty of mind to the extent of the limits we set around it, but ceases to do\nso if those limits lose their elasticity, and militate against the spirit of\nlove altogether; then our friendships become exclusive, our families selfish\nand inhospitable, our nations insular and aggressively inimical to other\nraces. It is like putting a burning light within a sealed enclosure, which\nshines brightly till the poisonous gases accumulate and smother the flame.\nNevertheless it has proved its truth before it dies, and made known the joy of\nfreedom from the grip of darkness, blind and empty and cold.\n\nAccording to the Upanishads, the key to cosmic consciousness, to God-\nconsciousness, is in the consciousness of the soul. To know our soul apart\nfrom the self is the first step towards the realisation of the supreme\ndeliverance. We must know with absolute certainty that essentially we are\nspirit. This we can do by winning mastery over self, by rising above all pride\nand greed and fear, by knowing that worldly losses and physical death can take\nnothing away from the truth and the greatness of our soul. The chick knows\nwhen it breaks through the self-centered isolation of its egg that the hard\nshell which covered it so long was not really a part of its life. That shell\nis a dead thing, it has no growth, it affords no glimpse whatever of the vast\nbeyond that lies outside it. However pleasantly perfect and rounded it may be,\nit must be given a blow to, it must be burst through and thereby the freedom\nof light and air be won, and the complete purpose of bird life be achieved. In\nSanskrit, the bird has been called the twice-born. So too the man who has gone\nthrough the ceremony of the discipline of self-restraint and high thinking for\na period of at least twelve years; who has come out simple in wants, pure in\nheart, and ready to take up all the responsibilities of life in a\ndisinterested largeness of spirit. He is considered to have had his rebirth\nfrom the blind envelopment of self to the freedom of soul life; to have come\ninto living relation with his surroundings; to have become at one with the\nAll.\n\nI have already warned my hearers, and must once more warn them against the\nidea that the teachers of India preached a renunciation of the world and of\nself which leads only to the blank emptiness of negation. Their aim was the\nrealisation of the soul, or, in other words, gaining the world in perfect\ntruth. When Jesus said, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the\nearth," he meant this. He proclaimed the truth that when man gets rid of his\npride of self then he comes into his true inheritance. No more has he to fight\nhis way into his position in the world; it is secure for him everywhere by the\nimmortal right of his soul. Pride of self interferes with the proper function\nof the soul which is to realise itself by perfecting its union with the world\nand the world\'s God.\n\nIn his sermon to Sadhu Simha Buddha says, _It is true, Simha, that I denounce\nactivities, but only the activities that lead to the evil in words, thoughts,\nor deeds. It is true, Simha, that I preach extinction, but only the extinction\nof pride, lust, evil thought, and ignorance, not that of forgiveness, love,\ncharity, and truth._\n\nThe doctrine of deliverance that Buddha preached was the freedom from the\nthraldom of _Avidy \xc4\x81_. _Avidy \xc4\x81_ is the ignorance that darkens our\nconsciousness, and tends to limit it within the boundaries of our personal\nself. It is this _Avidy \xc4\x81_, this ignorance, this limiting of consciousness\nthat creates the hard separateness of the ego, and thus becomes the source of\nall pride and greed and cruelty incidental to self-seeking. When a man sleeps\nhe is shut up within the narrow activities of his physical life. He lives, but\nhe knows not the varied relations of his life to his surroundings,--therefore\nhe knows not himself. So when a man lives the life of _Avidy \xc4\x81_ he is confined\nwithin his self. It is a spiritual sleep; his consciousness is not fully awake\nto the highest reality that surrounds him, therefore he knows not the reality\nof his own soul. When he attains _Bodhi_ , i.e. the awakenment from the sleep\nof self to the perfection of consciousness, he becomes Buddha.\n\nOnce I met two ascetics of a certain religious sect in a village of Bengal.\n"Can you tell me," I asked them, "wherein lies the special features of your\nreligion?" One of them hesitated for a moment and answered, "It is difficult\nto define that." The other said, "No, it is quite simple. We hold that we have\nfirst of all to know our own soul under the guidance of our spiritual teacher,\nand when we have done that we can find him, who is the Supreme Soul, within\nus." "Why don\'t you preach your doctrine to all the people of the world?" I\nasked. "Whoever feels thirsty will of himself come to the river," was his\nreply. "But then, do you find it so? Are they coming?" The man gave a gentle\nsmile, and with an assurance which had not the least tinge of impatience or\nanxiety, he said, "They must come, one and all."\n\nYes, he is right, this simple ascetic of rural Bengal. Man is indeed abroad to\nsatisfy needs which are more to him than food and clothing. He is out to find\nhimself. Man\'s history is the history of his journey to the unknown in quest\nof the realisation of his immortal self--his soul. Through the rise and fall\nof empires; through the building up gigantic piles of wealth and the ruthless\nscattering of them upon the dust; through the creation of vast bodies of\nsymbols that give shape to his dreams and aspirations, and the casting of them\naway like the playthings of an outworn infancy; through his forging of magic\nkeys with which to unlock the mysteries of creation, and through his throwing\naway of this labour of ages to go back to his workshop and work up afresh some\nnew form; yes, through it all man is marching from epoch to epoch towards the\nfullest realisation of his soul,--the soul which is greater than the things\nman accumulates, the deeds he accomplishes, the theories he builds; the soul\nwhose onward course is never checked by death or dissolution. Man\'s mistakes\nand failures have by no means been trifling or small, they have strewn his\npath with colossal ruins; his sufferings have been immense, like birth-pangs\nfor a giant child; they are the prelude of a fulfilment whose scope is\ninfinite. Man has gone through and is still undergoing martyrdoms in various\nways, and his institutions are the altars he has built whereto he brings his\ndaily sacrifices, marvellous in kind and stupendous in quantity. All this\nwould be absolutely unmeaning and unbearable if all along he did not feel that\ndeepest joy of the soul within him, which tries its divine strength by\nsuffering and proves its exhaustless riches by renunciation. Yes, they are\ncoming, the pilgrims, one and all--coming to their true inheritance of the\nworld; they are ever broadening their consciousness, ever seeking a higher and\nhigher unity, ever approaching nearer to the one central Truth which is all-\ncomprehensive.\n\nMan\'s poverty is abysmal, his wants are endless till he becomes truly\nconscious of his soul. Till then, the world to him is in a state of continual\nflux-- a phantasm that is and is not. For a man who has realised his soul\nthere is a determinate centre of the universe around which all else can find\nits proper place, and from thence only can he draw and enjoy the blessedness\nof a harmonious life.\n\nThere was a time when the earth was only a nebulous mass whose particles were\nscattered far apart through the expanding force of heat; when she had not yet\nattained her definiteness of form and had neither beauty nor purpose, but only\nheat and motion. Gradually, when her vapours were condensed into a unified\nrounded whole through a force that strove to bring all straggling matters\nunder the control of a centre, she occupied her proper place among the planets\nof the solar system, like an emerald pendant in a necklace of diamonds. So\nwith our soul. When the heat and motion of blind impulses and passions\ndistract it on all sides, we can neither give nor receive anything truly. But\nwhen we find our centre in our soul by the power of self-restraint, by the\nforce that harmonises all warring elements and unifies those that are apart,\nthen all our isolated impressions reduce themselves to wisdom, and all our\nmomentary impulses of heart find their completion in love; then all the petty\ndetails of our life reveal an infinite purpose, and all our thoughts and deeds\nunite themselves inseparably in an internal harmony.\n\nThe Upanishads say with great emphasis, _Know thou the One, the Soul._  21 _It\nis the bridge leading to the immortal being._  22\n\nThis is the ultimate end of man, to find the _One_ which is in him; which is\nhis truth, which is his soul; the key with which he opens the gate of the\nspiritual life, the heavenly kingdom. His desires are many, and madly they run\nafter the varied objects of the world, for therein they have their life and\nfulfilment. But that which is _one_ in him is ever seeking for unity--unity in\nknowledge, unity in love, unity in purposes of will; its highest joy is when\nit reaches the infinite one within its eternal unity. Hence the saying of the\nUpanishad, _Only those of tranquil minds, and none else, can attain abiding\njoy, by realising within their souls the Being who manifests one essence in a\nmultiplicity of forms._  23\n\n[Transcriber\'s note: The above footnote contains the * mark in the original\nprinted version. This has been retained as is.]\n\nThrough all the diversities of the world the one in us is threading its course\ntowards the one in all; this is its nature and this is its joy. But by that\ndevious path it could never reach its goal if it had not a light of its own by\nwhich it could catch the sight of what it was seeking in a flash. The vision\nof the Supreme One in our own soul is a direct and immediate intuition, not\nbased on any ratiocination or demonstration at all. Our eyes naturally see an\nobject as a whole, not by breaking it up into parts, but by bringing all the\nparts together into a unity with ourselves. So with the intuition of our Soul-\nconsciousness, which naturally and totally realises its unity in the Supreme\nOne.\n\nSays the Upanishad: _This deity who is manifesting himself in the activities\nof the universe always dwells in the heart of man as the supreme soul. Those\nwho realise him through the immediate perception of the heart attain\nimmortality._  24\n\nHe is _Vishvakarma_ ; that is, in a multiplicity of forms and forces lies his\noutward manifestation in nature; but his inner manifestation in our soul is\nthat which exists in unity. Our pursuit of truth in the domain of nature\ntherefore is through analysis and the gradual methods of science, but our\napprehension of truth in our soul is immediate and through direct intuition.\nWe cannot attain the supreme soul by successive additions of knowledge\nacquired bit by bit even through all eternity, because he is one, he is not\nmade up of parts; we can only know him as heart of our hearts and soul of our\nsoul; we can only know him in the love and joy we feel when we give up our\nself and stand before him face to face.\n\nThe deepest and the most earnest prayer that has ever risen from the human\nheart has been uttered in our ancient tongue: _O thou self-revealing one,\nreveal thyself in me._  25 We are in misery because we are creatures of self--\nthe self that is unyielding and narrow, that reflects no light, that is blind\nto the infinite. Our self is loud with its own discordant clamour--it is not\nthe tuned harp whose chords vibrate with the music of the eternal. Sighs of\ndiscontent and weariness of failure, idle regrets for the past and anxieties\nfor the future are troubling our shallow hearts because we have not found our\nsouls, and the self-revealing spirit has not been manifest within us. Hence\nour cry, _O thou awful one, save me with thy smile of grace ever and\nevermore._  26 It is a stifling shroud of death, this self-gratification, this\ninsatiable greed, this pride of possession, this insolent alienation of heart.\n_Rudra, O thou awful one, rend this dark cover in twain and let the saving\nbeam of thy smile of grace strike through this night of gloom and waken my\nsoul._\n\n_From unreality lead me to the real, from darkness to the light, from death to\nimmortality._  27 But how can one hope to have this prayer granted? For\ninfinite is the distance that lies between truth and untruth, between death\nand deathlessness. Yet this measureless gulf is bridged in a moment when the\nself revealing one reveals himself in the soul. There the miracle happens, for\nthere is the meeting-ground of the finite and infinite. _Father, completely\nsweep away all my sins!_  28 For in sin man takes part with the finite against\nthe infinite that is in him. It is the defeat of his soul by his self. It is a\nperilously losing game, in which man stakes his all to gain a part. Sin is the\nblurring of truth which clouds the purity of our consciousness. In sin we lust\nafter pleasures, not because they are truly desirable, but because the red\nlight of our passions makes them appear desirable; we long for things not\nbecause they are great in themselves, but because our greed exaggerates them\nand makes them appear great. These exaggerations, these falsifications of the\nperspective of things, break the harmony of our life at every step; we lose\nthe true standard of values and are distracted by the false claims of the\nvaried interests of life contending with one another. It is this failure to\nbring all the elements of his nature under the unity and control of the\nSupreme One that makes man feel the pang of his separation from God and gives\nrise to the earnest prayer, _O God, O Father, completely sweep away all our\nsins._  29 _Give unto us that which is good_  30 , the good which is the daily\nbread of our souls. In our pleasures we are confined to ourselves, in the good\nwe are freed and we belong to all. As the child in its mother\'s womb gets its\nsustenance through the union of its life with the larger life of its mother,\nso our soul is nourished only through the good which is the recognition of its\ninner kinship, the channel of its communication with the infinite by which it\nis surrounded and fed. Hence it is said, "Blessed are they which do hunger and\nthirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled." For righteousness is\nthe divine food of the soul; nothing but this can fill him, can make him live\nthe life of the infinite, can help him in his growth towards the eternal. _We\nbow to thee from whom come the enjoyments of our life._  31 _We bow also to\nthee from whom comes the good of our soul._  32 _We bow to thee who art good,\nthe highest good_  33 , in whom we are united with everything, that is, in\npeace and harmony, in goodness and love.\n\nMan\'s cry is to reach his fullest expression. It is this desire for self-\nexpression that leads him to seek wealth and power. But he has to discover\nthat accumulation is not realisation. It is the inner light that reveals him,\nnot outer things. When this light is lighted, then in a moment he knows that\nMan\'s highest revelation is God\'s own revelation in him. And his cry is for\nthis--the manifestation of his soul, which is the manifestation of God in his\nsoul. Man becomes perfect man, he attains his fullest expression, when his\nsoul realises itself in the Infinite being who is _\xc4\x80 vih_ whose very essence\nis expression.\n\nThe real misery of man is in the fact that he has not fully come out, that he\nis self-obscured, lost in the midst of his own desires. He cannot feel himself\nbeyond his personal surroundings, his greater self is blotted out, his truth\nis unrealised. The prayer that rises up from his whole being is therefore,\n_Thou, who art the spirit of manifestation, manifest thyself in me._  34 This\nlonging for the perfect expression of his self is more deeply inherent in man\nthan his hunger and thirst for bodily sustenance, his lust for wealth and\ndistinction. This prayer is not merely one born individually of him; it is in\ndepth of all things, it is the ceaseless urging in him of the _\xc4\x80 vih_, of the\nspirit of eternal manifestation. The revealment of the infinite in the finite,\nwhich is the motive of all creation, is not seen in its perfection in the\nstarry heavens, in the beauty of flowers. It is in the soul of man. For there\nwill seeks its manifestation in will, and freedom turns to win its final prize\nin the freedom of surrender.\n\nTherefore, it is the self of man which the great King of the universe has not\nshadowed with his throne--he has left it free. In his physical and mental\norganism, where man is related with nature, he has to acknowledge the rule of\nhis King, but in his self he is free to disown him. There our God must win his\nentrance. There he comes as a guest, not as a king, and therefore he has to\nwait till he is invited. It is the man\'s self from which God has withdrawn his\ncommands, for there he comes to court our love. His armed force, the laws of\nnature, stand outside its gate, and only beauty, the messenger of his love,\nfinds admission within its precincts.\n\nIt is only in this region of will that anarchy is permitted; only in man\'s\nself that the discord of untruth and unrighteousness hold its reign; and\nthings can come to such a pass that we may cry out in our anguish, "Such utter\nlawlessness could never prevail if there were a God!" Indeed, God has stood\naside from our self, where his watchful patience knows no bounds, and where he\nnever forces open the doors if shut against him. For this self of ours has to\nattain its ultimate meaning, which is the soul, not through the compulsion of\nGod\'s power but through love, and thus become united with God in freedom.\n\nHe whose spirit has been made one with God stands before man as the supreme\nflower of humanity. There man finds in truth what he is; for there the _\xc4\x80 vih_\nis revealed to him in the soul of man as the most perfect revelation for him\nof God; for there we see the union of the supreme will with our will, our love\nwith the love everlasting.\n\nTherefore, in our country he who truly loves God receives such homage from men\nas would be considered almost sacrilegious in the west. We see in him God\'s\nwish fulfilled, the most difficult of all obstacles to his revealment removed,\nand God\'s own perfect joy fully blossoming in humanity. Through him we find\nthe whole world of man overspread with a divine homeliness. His life, burning\nwith God\'s love, makes all our earthly love resplendent. All the intimate\nassociations of our life, all its experience of pleasure and pain, group\nthemselves around this display of the divine love, and from the drama that we\nwitness in him. The touch of an infinite mystery passes over the trivial and\nthe familiar, making it break out into ineffable music. The trees and the\nstars and the blue hills appear to us as symbols aching with a meaning which\ncan never be uttered in words. We seem to watch the Master in the very act of\ncreation of a new world when a man\'s soul draws her heavy curtain of self\naside, when her veil is lifted and she is face to face with her eternal lover.\n\nBut what is this state? It is like a morning of spring, varied in its life and\nbeauty, yet one and entire. When a man\'s life rescued from distractions finds\nits unity in the soul, then the consciousness of the infinite becomes at once\ndirect and natural to it as the light is to the flame. All the conflicts and\ncontradictions of life are reconciled; knowledge, love and action harmonized;\npleasure and pain become one in beauty, enjoyment and renunciation equal in\ngoodness; the breach between the finite and the infinite fills with love and\noverflows; every moment carries its message of the eternal; the formless\nappears to us in the form of the flower, of the fruit; the boundless takes us\nup in his arms as a father and walks by our side as a friend. It is only the\nsoul, the One in man which by its very nature can overcome all limits, and\nfinds its affinity with the Supreme One. While yet we have not attained the\ninternal harmony, and the wholeness of our being, our life remains a life of\nhabits. The world still appears to us as a machine, to be mastered where it is\nuseful, to be guarded against where it is dangerous, and never to be known in\nits full fellowship with us, alike in its physical nature and in its spiritual\nlife and beauty.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[20](sadh04.htm#fr_19) Na v\xc4\x81 ar\xc4\x93 putrasya k\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81ya putrah priy\xc5\x8d bhavati,\n\xc4\x81tmanastu k\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81ya putrah priy\xc5\x8d bhavati.\n\n[21](sadh04.htm#fr_20) Tam\xc4\x93vaikam j\xc4\x81natha \xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81nam.\n\n[22](sadh04.htm#fr_21) Amritasyaisha s\xc4\x93tuh.\n\n[23](sadh04.htm#fr_22) \xc4\x92kam r\xc5\xabpam bahudh\xc4\x81 yah kar\xc5\x8dti * * tam \xc4\x81tmastham y\xc4\x93\nanupa\xc3\xa7yanti d\xc4\xabhr\xc4\x81h, t\xc4\x93sh\xc4\x81m sukham \xc3\xa7\xc4\x81\xc3\xa7vatam n\xc4\x93tar\xc4\x93sh\xc4\x81m.\n\n[24](sadh04.htm#fr_23) \xc4\x92sha d\xc4\x93v\xc5\x8d vishvakarm\xc4\x81 mah\xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81 sad\xc4\x81 jan\xc4\x81n\xc4\x81m hriday\xc4\x93\nsannivishtah.
