What is meant by the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a? Is it a j\xc4\xabva?\nIs it a body? Is it a class? Is it j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na? Is it karma? Or is it a doer of\n\xe1\xb8\x8dharma?\n\nTo begin with: is j\xc4\xabva the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a? No. Since the j\xc4\xabva is the same in the\nmany past and future bodies (of all persons), and since the j\xc4\xabva is the same\nin all of the many bodies obtained through the force of karma, therefore j\xc4\xabva\nis not the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\nThen is the body the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a? No. Since the body, as it is made up of the\nfive elements, is the same for all people down to cha\xe1\xb9\x87d\xc4\x81las, 2 etc., since old\nage and death, \xe1\xb8\x8dharma and a\xe1\xb8\x8dharma are found to be common to them all, since\nthere is no absolute distinction that the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as are white-coloured, the\nksha\xe1\xb9\xadriyas red, the vai\xc5\x9byas yellow, and the \xc5\x9b\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8dras dark, and since in burning\nthe corpse of his father, etc., the stain of the murder of a br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a, etc.,\nwill accrue to the son, etc., therefore the body is not the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\np. 111\n\nThen is a class the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a? No. Since many great \xe1\xb9\x9ashis have sprung from\nother castes and orders of creation--\xe1\xb9\x9ashya\xc5\x9b\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\x85ga was born of deer; Kau\xc5\x9bika, of\nKu\xc5\x9ba grass; J\xc4\x81mbuka of a jackal; V\xc4\x81lm\xc4\xabki of valm\xc4\xabka (an ant-hill); Vy\xc4\x81sa of a\nfisherman's daughter; Gau\xe1\xb9\xadama, of the posteriors of a hare; Vasishtha of\n\xc5\xaarva\xc5\x9bi 1; and Agas\xe1\xb9\xadya of a water-pot; thus have we heard. Of these, many \xe1\xb9\x9ashis\noutside the caste even have stood first among the teachers of divine Wisdom;\ntherefore a class is not the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\nIs j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a? No. Since there were many ksha\xe1\xb9\xadriyas and others well\nversed in the cognition of divine Truth, therefore j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is not the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\nThen is karma the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a? No. Since the pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha 2, sa\xc3\xb1chi\xe1\xb9\xada 3, and \xc4\x81gami 4\nkarmas are the same for all beings, and since all people perform their actions\nas impelled by karma, therefore karma is not the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\nThen is a doer of \xe1\xb8\x8dharma (virtuous actions) the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a? No. Since there are\nmany ksha\xe1\xb9\xadriyas, etc., who are givers of gold, therefore a doer of virtuous\nactions is not the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\nWho indeed then is br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a? Whoever he may be, he who has directly realised\nhis \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and who is directly cognizant, like the myrobalan in his palm, of his\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma that is without a second, that is devoid of class and actions, that is\nfree from the faults of the six stains 5 and the six changes,  6 that is of\nthe nature of truth, knowledge, bliss, and eternity, that is without any\nchange in itself, that is the substratum of all the kalpas, that exists\npenetrating all things that pervades everything within and without as \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b,\nthat is of nature of undivided bliss, that cannot be reasoned about and that\nis known only by direct cognition. He who by the reason of having obtained his\nwishes is devoid of the faults of thirst after worldly objects and passions,\nwho is the possessor of the qualifications beginning\n\np. 112\n\nwith \xc5\x9bama 1, who is free from emotion, malice, thirst after worldly objects,\ndesire, delusion, etc., whose mind is untouched by pride, egoism, etc., who\npossesses all these qualities and means--he only is the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\nSuch is the opinion of the ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, the sm\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadis, the i\xe1\xb9\xadih\xc4\x81sa and the pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as.\nOtherwise one cannot obtain the status of a br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a. One should meditate on\nhis \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da, and the non-dual Brahman. Yea, one should meditate\non his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as the Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da Brahman. Such is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[110:1](tmu16.htm#fr_66) Lit., the diamond-needle-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n[110:2](tmu16.htm#fr_67) The lowest class of persons among the Hin\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc5\xabs.\n\n[111:1](tmu16.htm#fr_68) One of the celestial nymphs dancing in the court of\nIn\xe1\xb8\x8dra.\n\n[111:2](tmu16.htm#fr_69) The karmic affinities generated by us in our former\nlives, the fruit of which is being enjoyed in our present life.\n\n[111:3](tmu16.htm#fr_70) The karmic affinities generated by us in our former\nlives and collected together to be enjoyed in our future lives.\n\n[111:4](tmu16.htm#fr_71) The affinities generated by us in our present life to\nbe enjoyed hereafter.\n\n[111:5](tmu16.htm#fr_72) The six stains--hunger, thirst, grief, confusion, old\nage, and death.\n\n[111:6](tmu16.htm#fr_73) Birth, existence, etc.\n\n[112:1](tmu16.htm#fr_74) Sama, \xe1\xb8\x8dama, upara\xe1\xb9\xadi, \xe1\xb9\xadi\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xabksh\xc4\x81, sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81na, and\nsra\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15. \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81r\xc4\xabraka-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d of K\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xe1\xb9\x87a-Yajurve\xe1\xb8\x8da](tmu17.htm)\n\n"
