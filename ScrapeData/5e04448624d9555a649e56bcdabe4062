In the first place all Vedic\ntexts must, in order to be understood, be read together with running\ncommentaries such as Saya _n_ a's commentaries on the Sa _m_ hitas and Brahma\n_n_ as, and the Bhashyas ascribed to _S_ a _n_ kara on the chief Upanishads.\nBut these commentaries do not by themselves conduce to a full comprehension of\nthe contents of the sacred texts, since they confine themselves to explaining\nthe meaning of each detached passage without investigating its relation to\nother passages, and the whole of which they form part; considerations of the\nlatter kind are at any rate introduced occasionally only. The task of taking a\ncomprehensive view of the contents of the Vedic writings as a whole, of\nsystematising what they present in an unsystematical form, of showing the\nmutual co-ordination or subordination of single passages and sections, and of\nreconciling contradictions--which, according to the view of the orthodox\ncommentators, can be apparent only--is allotted to a separate _s_ astra or\nbody of doctrine which is termed Mima _m_ sa, i.e. the investigation or\nenquiry \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xe1\xbe\xbd \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xb6\xce\xbf\xcf\x87\xe1\xbd\xb5\xce\xbd, viz. the enquiry into the connected meaning of the sacred\ntexts.\n\nOf this Mima _m_ sa two branches have to be distinguished, the so-called\nearlier (purva) Mima _m_ sa, and the later (uttara) Mima _m_ sa. The former\nundertakes to systematise the karmaka _nd_ a, i.e. that entire portion of the\nVeda which is concerned with action, pre-eminently sacrificial action, and\nwhich comprises the Sa _m_ hitas and the Brahma _n_ as exclusive of the \xc3\x82ra\n_n_ yaka portions; the latter performs the same\n\np. x\n\nservice with regard to the so-called _g \xc3\xb1_anaka _nd_ a, i.e. that part of the\nVedic writings which includes the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka portions of the Brahma _n_ as,\nand a number of detached treatises called Upanishads. Its subject is not\naction but knowledge, viz. the knowledge of Brahman.\n\nAt what period these two _s_ astras first assumed a definite form, we are\nunable to ascertain. Discussions of the nature of those which constitute the\nsubject-matter of the Purva Mima _m_ sa must have arisen at a very early\nperiod, and the word Mima _m_ sa itself together with its derivatives is\nalready employed in the Brahma _n_ as to denote the doubts and discussions\nconnected with certain contested points of ritual. The want of a body of\ndefinite rules prescribing how to act, i.e. how to perform the various\nsacrifices in full accordance with the teaching of the Veda, was indeed an\nurgent one, because it was an altogether practical want, continually pressing\nitself on the adhvaryus engaged in ritualistic duties. And the task of\nestablishing such rules was moreover a comparatively limited and feasible one;\nfor the members of a certain Vedic _s_ akha or school had to do no more than\nto digest thoroughly their own brahma _n_ a and sa _m_ hita, without being\nunder any obligation of reconciling with the teaching of their own books the\noccasionally conflicting rules implied in the texts of other _s_ akhas. It was\nassumed that action, as being something which depends on the will and choice\nof man, admits of alternatives, so that a certain sacrifice may be performed\nin different ways by members of different Vedic schools, or even by the\nfollowers of one and the same _s_ akha.\n\nThe Uttara Mima _m_ sa- _s_ astra may be supposed to have originated\nconsiderably later than the Purva Mima _m_ sa. In the first place, the texts\nwith which it is concerned doubtless constitute the latest branch of Vedic\nliterature. And in the second place, the subject-matter of those texts did not\ncall for a systematical treatment with equal urgency, as it was in no way\nconnected with practice; the mental attitude of the authors of the Upanishads,\nwho in their lucubrations on Brahman and the soul aim at nothing less than at\ndefiniteness and coherence, may have perpetuated itself through\n\np. xi\n\nmany generations without any great inconvenience resulting therefrom.\n\nBut in the long run two causes must have acted with ever-increasing force, to\ngive an impulse to the systematic working up of the teaching of the Upanishads\nalso. The followers of the different Vedic sakhas no doubt recognised already\nat an early period the truth that, while conflicting statements regarding the\ndetails of a sacrifice can be got over by the assumption of a vikalpa, i.e. an\noptional proceeding, it is not so with regard to such topics as the nature of\nBrahman, the relation to it of the human soul, the origin of the physical\nuniverse, and the like. Concerning them, one opinion only can be the true one,\nand it therefore becomes absolutely incumbent on those, who look on the whole\nbody of the Upanishads as revealed truth, to demonstrate that their teaching\nforms a consistent whole free from all contradictions. In addition there\nsupervened the external motive that, while the karma-ka _nd_ a of the Veda\nconcerned only the higher castes of brahmanically constituted society, on\nwhich it enjoins certain sacrificial performances connected with certain\nrewards, the _g \xc3\xb1_anaka _nd_ a, as propounding a certain theory of the world,\ntowards which any reflecting person inside or outside the pale of the orthodox\ncommunity could not but take up a definite position, must soon have become the\nobject of criticism on the part of those who held different views on religious\nand philosophic things, and hence stood in need of systematic defence.\n\nAt present there exists a vast literature connected with the two branches of\nthe Mima _m_ sa. We have, on the one hand, all those works which constitute\nthe Purva Mima _m_ sa- _s_ astra--or as it is often, shortly but not\naccurately, termed, the Mima _m_ sa-sastra--and, on the other hand, all those\nworks which are commonly comprised under the name Vedanta- _s_ astra. At the\nhead of this extensive literature there stand two collections of Sutras (i. e.\nshort aphorisms constituting in their totality a complete body of doctrine\nupon some subject), whose reputed authors are _G_ aimini and Badaraya _n_ a.\nThere can, however, be no doubt that the composition of those two\n\np. xii\n\ncollections of Sutras was preceded by a long series of preparatory literary\nefforts of which they merely represent the highly condensed outcome. This is\nrendered probable by the analogy of other _s_ astras, as well as by the\nexhaustive thoroughness with which the Sutras perform their task of\nsystematizing the teaching of the Veda, and is further proved by the frequent\nreferences which the Sutras make to the views of earlier teachers. If we\nconsider merely the preserved monuments of Indian literature, the Sutras (of\nthe two Mima _m_ sas as well as of other _s_ astras) mark the beginning; if\nwe, however, take into account what once existed, although it is at present\nirretrievably lost, we observe that they occupy a strictly central position,\nsummarising, on the one hand, a series of early literary essays extending over\nmany generations, and forming, on the other hand, the head spring of an ever\nbroadening activity of commentators as well as virtually independent writers,\nwhich reaches down to our days, and may yet have some future before itself.\n\nThe general scope of the two Mima _m_ sa-sutras and their relation to the Veda\nhave been indicated in what precedes. A difference of some importance between\nthe two has, however, to be noted in this connexion. The systematisation of\nthe karmaka _nd_ a of the Veda led to the elaboration of two classes of works,\nviz. the Kalpa-sutras on the one hand, and the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras on the\nother hand. The former give nothing but a description as concise as possible\nof the sacrifices enjoined in the Brahma _n_ as; while the latter discuss and\nestablish the general principles which the author of a Kalpa-sutra has to\nfollow, if he wishes to render his rules strictly conformable to the teaching\nof the Veda. The _g \xc3\xb1_anaka _nd_ a of the Veda, on the other hand, is\nsystematised in a single work, viz. the Uttara Mima _m_ sa or Vedanta-sutras,\nwhich combine the two tasks of concisely stating the teaching of the Veda, and\nof argumentatively establishing the special interpretation of the Veda adopted\nin the Sutras. This difference may be accounted for by two reasons. In the\nfirst place, the contents of the karmaka _nd_ a, as being of an entirely\npractical nature, called for summaries such as the Kalpa-sutras, from which\nall burdensome discussions of\n\np. xiii\n\nmethod are excluded; while there was no similar reason for the separation of\nthe two topics in the case of the purely theoretical science of Brahman. And,\nin the second place, the Vedanta-sutras throughout presuppose the Purva Mima\n_m_ sa-sutras, and may therefore dispense with the discussion of general\nprinciples and methods already established in the latter.\n\nThe time at which the two Mima _m_ sa-sutras were composed we are at present\nunable to fix with any certainty; a few remarks on the subject will, however,\nbe made later on. Their outward form is that common to all the so-called\nSutras which aims at condensing a given body of doctrine in a number of\nconcise aphoristic sentences, and often even mere detached words in lieu of\nsentences. Besides the Mima _m_ sa-sutras this literary form is common to the\nfundamental works on the other philosophic systems, on the Vedic sacrifices,\non domestic ceremonies, on sacred law, on grammar, and on metres. The two Mima\n_m_ sa-sutras occupy, however, an altogether exceptional position in point of\nstyle. All Sutras aim at conciseness; that is clearly the reason to which this\nwhole species of literary composition owes its existence. This their aim they\nreach by the rigid exclusion of all words which can possibly be spared, by the\ncareful avoidance of all unnecessary repetitions, and, as in the case of the\ngrammatical Sutras, by the employment of an arbitrarily coined terminology\nwhich substitutes single syllables for entire words or combination of words.\nAt the same time the manifest intention of the Sutra writers is to express\nthemselves with as much clearness as the conciseness affected by them admits\nof. The aphorisms are indeed often concise to excess, but not otherwise\nintrinsically obscure, the manifest care of the writers being to retain what\nis essential in a given phrase, and to sacrifice only what can be supplied,\nalthough perhaps not without difficulty, and an irksome strain of memory and\nreflection. Hence the possibility of understanding without a commentary a very\nconsiderable portion at any rate of the ordinary Sutras. Altogether different\nis the case of the two Mima _m_ sa-sutras. There scarcely one single Sutra is\n\np. xiv\n\nintelligible without a commentary. The most essential words are habitually\ndispensed with; nothing is, for instance, more common than the simple omission\nof the subject or predicate of a sentence. And when here and there a Sutra\noccurs whose words construe without anything having to be supplied, the\nphraseology is so eminently vague and obscure that without the help derived\nfrom a commentary we should be unable to make out to what subject the Sutra\nrefers. When undertaking to translate either of the Mima _m_ sa-sutras we\ntherefore depend altogether on commentaries; and hence the question arises\nwhich of the numerous commentaries extant is to be accepted as a guide to\ntheir right understanding.\n\nThe commentary here selected for translation, together with Badaraya _n_ a's\nSutras 1 (to which we shall henceforth confine our attention to the exclusion\nof _G_ aimini's Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras), is the one composed by the\ncelebrated theologian _S_ a _n_ kara or, as he is commonly called, _S_ a _n_\nkara _k_ arya. There are obvious reasons for this selection. In the first\nplace, the _S_ a _n_ kara-bhashya represents the so-called orthodox side of\nBrahmanical theology which strictly upholds the Brahman or highest Self of the\nUpanishads as something different from, and in fact immensely superior to, the\ndivine beings such as Vish _n_ u or Siva, which, for many centuries, have been\nthe chief objects of popular worship in India. In the second place, the\ndoctrine advocated by _S_ a _n_ kara is, from a purely philosophical point of\nview and apart from all theological considerations, the most important and\ninteresting one which has arisen on Indian soil; neither those forms of the\nVedanta which diverge from the view represented by _S_ a _n_ kara nor any of\nthe non-Vedantic systems can be compared with the so-called orthodox Vedanta\nin boldness, depth, and subtlety of speculation. In the third place, _S_ a _n_\nkara's bhashya is, as far as we know, the oldest of the extant commentaries,\nand relative antiquity is at any rate one of the circumstances which have to\nbe\n\np. xv\n\ntaken into account, although, it must be admitted, too much weight may easily\nbe attached to it. The _S_ a _n_ kara-bhashya further is the authority most\ngenerally deferred to in India as to the right understanding of the Vedanta-\nsutras, and ever since _S_ a _n_ kara's time the majority of the best thinkers\nof India have been men belonging to his school. If in addition to all this we\ntake into consideration the intrinsic merits of _S_ a _n_ kara's work which,\nas a piece of philosophical argumentation and theological apologetics,\nundoubtedly occupies a high rank, the preference here given to it will be\neasily understood.\n\nBut to the European--or, generally, modern--translator of the Vedanta-sutras\nwith _S_ a _n_ kara's commentary another question will of course suggest\nitself at once, viz. whether or not _S_ a _n_ kara's explanations faithfully\nrender the intended meaning of the author of the Sutras. To the Indian Pandit\nof _S_ a _n_ kara's school this question has become an indifferent one, or, to\nstate the case more accurately, he objects to its being raised, as he looks on\n_S_ a _n_ kara's authority as standing above doubt and dispute. When pressed\nto make good his position he will, moreover, most probably not enter into any\ndetailed comparison of _S_ a _n_ kara's comments with the text of Badaraya _n_\na's Sutras, but will rather endeavour to show on speculative grounds that _S_\na _n_ kara's philosophical view is the only true one, whence it of course\nfollows that it accurately represents the meaning of Badaraya _n_ a, who\nhimself must necessarily be assured to have taught the true doctrine. But on\nthe modern investigator, who neither can consider himself bound by the\nauthority of a name however great, nor is likely to look to any Indian system\nof thought for the satisfaction of his speculative wants, it is clearly\nincumbent not to acquiesce from the out set in the interpretations given of\nthe Vedanta-sutras--and the Upanishads--by _S_ a _n_ kara and his school, but\nto submit them, as far as that can be done, to a critical investigation.\n\nThis is a task which would have to be undertaken even if _S_ a _n_ kara's\nviews as to the true meaning of the Sutras and Upanishads had never been\ncalled into doubt on Indian soil, although in that case it could perhaps\nhardly be entered\n\np. xvi\n\nupon with much hope of success; but it becomes much more urgent, and at the\nsame time more feasible, when we meet in India itself with systems claiming to\nbe Vedantic and based on interpretations of the Sutras and Upanishads more or\nless differing from those of _S_ a _n_ kara. The claims of those systems to be\nin the possession of the right understanding of the fundamental authorities of\nthe Vedanta must at any rate be examined, even if we should finally be\ncompelled to reject them.\n\nIt appears that already at a very early period the Vedanta-sutras had come to\nbe looked upon as an authoritative work, not to be neglected by any who wished\nto affiliate their own doctrines to the Veda. At present, at any rate, there\nare very few Hindu sects not interested in showing that their distinctive\ntenets are countenanced by Badaraya _n_ a's teaching. Owing to this the\ncommentaries on the Sutras have in the course of time become very numerous,\nand it is at present impossible to give a full and accurate enumeration even\nof those actually existing, much less of those referred to and quoted. Mr.\nFitz-Edward Hall, in his Bibliographical Index, mentions fourteen\ncommentaries, copies of which had been inspected by himself. Some among these\n(as, for instance, Ramanu _g_ a's Vedanta-sara, No. XXXV) are indeed not\ncommentaries in the strict sense of the word, but rather systematic\nexpositions of the doctrine supposed to be propounded in the Sutras; but, on\nthe other hand, there are in existence several true commentaries which had not\nbeen accessible to Fitz-Edward Hall. it would hardly be practical--and\ncertainly not feasible in this place--to submit all the existing bhashyas to a\ncritical enquiry at once. All we can do here is to single out one or a few of\nthe more important ones, and to compare their interpretations with those given\nby _S_ a _n_ kara, and with the text of the Sutras themselves.\n\nThe bhashya, which in this connexion is the first to press itself upon our\nattention, is the one composed by the famous Vaish _n_ ava theologian and\nphilosopher Ramanu _g_ a, who is supposed to have lived in the twelfth\ncentury. The Ramanu _g_ a or, as it is often called, the _S_ ri-bhashya\nappears to be\n\np. xvii\n\nthe oldest commentary extant next to _S_ a _n_ kara's. It is further to be\nnoted that the sect of the Ramanu _g_ as occupies a pre-eminent position among\nthe Vaishnava, sects which themselves, in their totality, may claim to be\nconsidered the most important among all Hindu sects. The intrinsic value of\nthe _S_ ri-bhashya moreover is--as every student acquainted with it will be\nready to acknowledge--a very high one; it strikes one throughout as a very\nsolid performance due to a writer of extensive learning and great power of\nargumentation, and in its polemic parts, directed chiefly against the school\nof _S_ a _n_ kara, it not unfrequently deserves to be called brilliant even.\nAnd in addition to all this it shows evident traces of being not the mere\noutcome of Ramanu _g_ a's individual views, but of resting on an old and\nweighty tradition.\n\nThis latter point is clearly of the greatest importance. If it could be\ndemonstrated or even rendered probable only that the oldest bhashya which we\npossess, i. e. the _S_ a _n_ kara-bhashya, represents an uninterrupted and\nuniform tradition bridging over the interval between Badaraya _n_ a, the\nreputed author of the Sutras, and _S_ a _n_ kara; and if, on the other hand,\nit could be shown that the more modern bhashyas are not supported by old\ntradition, but are nothing more than bold attempts of clever sectarians to\nforce an old work of generally recognised authority into the service of their\nindividual tenets; there would certainly be no reason for us to raise the\nquestion whether the later bhashyas can help us in making out the true meaning\nof the Sutras. All we should have to do in that case would be to accept _S_ a\n_n_ kara's interpretations as they stand, or at the utmost to attempt to make\nout, if at all possible, by a careful comparison of _S_ a _n_ kara's bhashya\nwith the text of the Sutras, whether the former in all cases faithfully\nrepresents the purport of the latter.\n\nIn the most recent book of note which at all enters into the question as to\nhow far we have to accept _S_ a _n_ kara as a guide to the right understanding\nof the Sutras (Mr. A. Gough's Philosophy of the Upanishads) the view is\nmaintained (pp. 239 ff.) that _S_ a _n_ kara is the generally recognised\nexpositor\n\np. xviii\n\nof true Vedanta doctrine, that that doctrine was handed down by an unbroken\nseries of teachers intervening between him and the Sutrakara, and that there\nexisted from the beginning only one Vedanta doctrine, agreeing in all\nessential points with the doctrine known to us from _S_ a _n_ kara's writings.\nMr. Gough undertakes to prove this view, firstly, by a comparison of _S_ a _n_\nkara's system with the teaching of the Upanishads themselves; and, secondly,\nby a comparison of the purport of the Sutras--as far as that can be made out\nindependently of the commentaries--with the interpretations given of them by\n_S_ a _n_ kara. To both these points we shall revert later on. Meanwhile, I\nonly wish to remark concerning the former point that, even if we could show\nwith certainty that all the Upanishads propound one and the same doctrine,\nthere yet remains the undeniable fact of our being confronted by a\nconsiderable number of essentially differing theories, all of which claim to\nbe founded on the Upanishads. And with regard to the latter point I have to\nsay for the present that, as long as we have only _S_ a _n_ kara's bhashya\nbefore us, we are naturally inclined to find in the Sutras--which, taken by\nthemselves, are for the greater part unintelligible--the meaning which _S_ a\n_n_ kara ascribes to them; while a reference to other bhashyas may not\nimpossibly change our views at once.--Meanwhile, we will consider the question\nas to the unbroken uniformity of Vedantic tradition from another point or\nview, viz. by enquiring whether or not the Sutras themselves, and the _S_ a\n_n_ kara-bhashya, furnish any indications of there having existed already at\nan early time essentially different Vedantic systems or lines of Vedantic\nspeculation.\n\nBeginning with the Sutras, we find that they supply ample evidence to the\neffect that already at a very early time, viz. the period antecedent to the\nfinal composition of the Vedanta-sutras in their present shape, there had\narisen among the chief doctors of the Vedanta differences of opinion, bearing\nnot only upon minor points of doctrine, but affecting the most essential parts\nof the system. In addition to Badaraya _n_ a himself, the reputed author of\nthe\n\np. xix\n\n[paragraph continues] Sutras, the latter quote opinions ascribed to the\nfollowing teachers: \xc3\x82treya, \xc3\x82 _s_ marathya, Au _d_ ulomi, Karsh _n_ agini, Ka\n_s_ ak _ri_ tsna, _G_ aimini, Badari. Among the passages where diverging views\nof those teachers are recorded and contrasted three are of particular\nimportance. Firstly, a passage in the fourth pada of the fourth adhyaya\n(Sutras 5-7), where the opinions of various teachers concerning the\ncharacteristics of the released soul are given, and where the important\ndiscrepancy is noted that, according to Au _d_ ulomi, its only characteristic\nis thought ( _k_ aitanya), while Gaimini maintains that it possesses a number\nof exalted qualities, and Badaraya _n_ a declares himself in favour of a\ncombination of those two views.--The second passage occurs in the third pada\nof the fourth adhyaya (Sutras 7-14), where _G_ aimini maintains that the soul\nof him who possesses the lower knowledge of Brahman goes after death to the\nhighest Brahman, while Badari--whose opinion is endorsed by _S_ a _n_ kara--\nteaches that it repairs to the lower Brahman only--Finally, the third and most\nimportant passage is met with in the fourth pada of the first adhyaya (Sutras\n20-22), where the question is discussed why in a certain passage of the B _ri_\nhadara _n_ yaka Brahman is referred to in terms which are strictly applicable\nto the individual soul only. In connexion therewith the Sutras quote the views\nof three ancient teachers about the relation in which the individual soul\nstands to Brahman. According to \xc3\x82 _s_ marathya (if we accept the\ninterpretation of his view given by _S_ a _n_ kara and _S_ a _n_ kara's\ncommentators) the soul stands to Brahman in the bhedabheda relation, i.e. it\nis neither absolutely different nor absolutely non-different from it, as\nsparks are from fire. Audulomi, on the other hand, teaches that the soul is\naltogether different from Brahman up to the time when obtaining final release\nit is merged in it, and Ka _s_ ak _ri_ tsna finally upholds the doctrine that\nthe soul is absolutely non-different from Brahman; which, in, some way or\nother presents itself as the individual soul.\n\nThat the ancient teachers, the ripest outcome of whose speculations and\ndiscussions is embodied in the Vedanta-sutras, disagreed among themselves on\npoints of vital\n\np. xx\n\nimportance is sufficiently proved by the three passages quoted. The one quoted\nlast is specially significant as showing that recognised authorities--deemed\nworthy of being quoted in the Sutras--denied that doctrine on which the whole\nsystem of _S_ a _n_ kara hinges, viz. the doctrine of the absolute identity of\nthe individual soul with Brahman.\n\nTurning next to the _S_ a _n_ kara-bhashya itself, we there also meet with\nindications that the Vedantins were divided among themselves on important\npoints of dogma. These indications are indeed not numerous: _S_ a _n_ kara,\ndoes not on the whole impress one as an author particularly anxious to\nstrengthen his own case by appeals to ancient authorities, a peculiarity of\nhis which later writers of hostile tendencies have not failed to remark and\ncriticise. But yet more than once _S_ a _n_ kara also refers to the opinion of\n'another,' viz., commentator of the Sutras, and in several places _S_ a _n_\nkara's commentators explain that the 'other' meant is the V _ri_ ttikara\n(about whom more will be said shortly). Those references as a rule concern\nminor points of exegesis, and hence throw little or no light on important\ndifferences of dogma; but there are two remarks of _S_ a _n_ kara's at any\nrate which are of interest in this connexion. The one is made with reference\nto Sutras 7-14 of the third pada of the fourth adhyaya; 'some,' he says there,\n'declare those Sutras, which I look upon as setting forth the siddhanta view,\nto state merely the purvapaksha;' a difference of opinion which, as we have\nseen above, affects the important question as to the ultimate fate of those\nwho have not reached the knowledge of the highest Brahman.--And under I, 3, 19\n_S_ a _n_ kara, after having explained at length that the individual soul as\nsuch cannot claim any reality, but is real only in so far as it is identical\nwith Brahman, adds the following words, 'apare tu vadina _h_ paramarthikam eva\n_g_ aiva _m_ rupam iti manyante asmadiya _s_ _k_ a ke _k_ it,' i. e. other\ntheorisers again, and among them some of ours, are of opinion that the\nindividual soul as such is real.' The term 'ours,' here made use of, can\ndenote only the Aupanishadas or Vedantins, and it thus appears that _S_ a _n_\nkara himself\n\np. xxi\n\nwas willing to class under the same category himself and philosophers who--as\nin later times the Ramanu _g_ as and others--looked upon the individual soul\nas not due to the fictitious limitations of Maya, but as real in itself;\nwhatever may be the relation in which they considered it to stand to the\nhighest Self.\n\nFrom what precedes it follows that the Vedantins of the school to which _S_ a\n_n_ kara himself belonged acknowledged the existence of Vedantic teaching of a\ntype essentially different from their own. We must now proceed to enquire\nwhether the Ramanu _g_ a system, which likewise claims to be Vedanta, and to\nbe founded on the Vedanta-sutras, has any title to be considered an ancient\nsystem and the heir of a respectable tradition.\n\nIt appears that Ramanu _g_ a claims--and by Hindu writers is generally\nadmitted--to follow in his bhashya the authority of Bodhayana, who had\ncomposed a v _ri_ tti on the Sutras. Thus we read in the beginning of the _S_\nri-bhashya (Pandit, New Series, VII, p. 163), 'Bhagavad-bodhayanak _ri_ ta _m_\nvistirna _m_ brahmasutra-v _ri_ tti _m_ purva _k_ arya _h_ sa _m_ kikshipus\ntanmatanusare _n_ a sutrakshara _n_ i vyakhyasyante.' Whether the Bodhayana to\nwhom that v _ri_ tti is ascribed is to be identified with the author of the\nKalpa-sutra, and other works, cannot at present be decided. But that an\nancient v _ri_ tti on the Sutras connected with Bodhayana's name actually\nexisted, there is not any reason to doubt. Short quotations from it are met\nwith in a few places of the _S_ ri-bhashya, and, as we have seen above, _S_ a\n_n_ kara's commentators state that their author's polemical remarks are\ndirected against the V _ri_ ttikara. In addition to Bodhayana, Ramanu _g_ a\nappeals to quite a series of ancient teachers--purva _k_ aryas--who carried on\nthe true tradition as to the teaching of the Vedanta and the meaning of the\nSutras. In the Vedarthasa _n_ graha--a work composed by Ramanu _g_ a himself--\nwe meet in one place with the enumeration of the following authorities:\nBodhayana, _T_ a _n_ ka, Drami _d_ a, Guhadeva, Kapardin, Bharu _k_ i, and\nquotations from the writings of some of these are not unfrequent in the\nVedarthasa _n_ graha, as well as the _S_ ri-bhashya.\n\np. xxii\n\n[paragraph continues] The author most frequently quoted is Drami _d_ a 1, who\ncomposed the Drami _d_ a-bhashya; he is sometimes referred to as the\nbhashyakara. Another writer repeatedly quoted as the vakyakara is, I am told\n2, to be identified with the _T_ a _n_ ka mentioned above. I refrain from\ninserting in this place the information concerning the relative age of these\nwriters which may be derived from the oral tradition of the Ramanu _g_ a sect.\nFrom another source, however, we receive an intimation that Drami _d_ a _k_\narya or Dravi _d_ a _k_ arya preceded _S_ a _n_ kara in point of time. In his\n_t_ ika on _S_ a _n_ kara's bhashya to the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad III, 10, 4,\n\xc3\x82nandagiri remarks that the attempt made by his author to reconcile the\ncosmological views of the Upanishad with the teaching of Sm _ri_ ti on the\nsame point is a reproduction of the analogous attempt made by the Dravi _d_ a\n_k_ arya.\n\nIt thus appears that that special interpretation of the Vedanta-sutras with\nwhich the _S_ ri-bhashya makes us acquainted is not due to innovating views on\nthe part of Ramanu _g_ a, but had authoritative representatives already at a\nperiod anterior to that of _S_ a _n_ kara. This latter point, moreover,\nreceives additional confirmation from the relation in which the so-called\nRamanu _g_ a sect stands to earlier sects. What the exact position of Ramanu\n_g_ a was, and of what nature were the reforms that rendered him so prominent\nas to give his name to a new sect, is not exactly known at present; at the\nsame time it is generally acknowledged that the Ramanu _g_ as are closely\nconnected with the so-called Bhagavatas or Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratras, who are known to\nhave existed already at a very early time. This latter point is proved by\nevidence of various kinds; for our present purpose it suffices to point to the\nfact that, according to the interpretation of the most authoritative\ncommentators, the last\n\np. xxiii\n\n[paragraph continues] Sutras of the second pada of the second adhyaya\n(Vedanta-sutras) refer to a distinctive tenet of the Bhagavatas--which tenet\nforms part of the Ramanu _g_ a system also--viz. that the highest being\nmanifests itself in a fourfold form (vyuha) as Vasudeva, Sa _n_ karsha _n_ a,\nPradyumna, Aniruddha, those four forms being identical with the highest Self,\nthe individual soul, the internal organ (manas), and the principle. of egoity\n(aha _n_ kara). Whether those Sutras embody an approval of the tenet referred\nto, as Ramanu _g_ a maintains, or are meant to impugn it, as _S_ a _n_ kara\nthinks; so much is certain that in the opinion of the best commentators the\nBhagavatas, the direct forerunners of the Ramanu _g_ as, are mentioned in the\nSutras themselves, and hence must not only have existed, but even reached a\nconsiderable degree of importance at the time when the Sutras were composed.\nAnd considering the general agreement of the systems of the earlier Bhagavatas\nand the later Ramanu _g_ as, we have a full right to suppose that the two\nsects were at one also in their mode of interpreting the Vedanta-sutras.\n\nThe preceding considerations suffice, I am inclined to think, to show that it\nwill by no means be wasted labour to enquire how Ramanu _g_ a interprets the\nSutras, and wherein he differs from _S_ a _n_ kara. This in fact seems clearly\nto be the first step we have to take, if we wish to make an attempt at least\nof advancing beyond the interpretations of scholiasts to the meaning of the\nSutras themselves. A full and exhaustive comparison of the views of the two\ncommentators would indeed far exceed the limits of the space which can here he\ndevoted to that task, and will, moreover, be made with greater ease and\nadvantage when the complete Sanskrit text of the _S_ ri-bhashya has been\nprinted, and thus made available for general reference. But meanwhile it is\npossible, and--as said before--even urged upon a translator of the Sutras to\ncompare the interpretations, given by the two bhashyakaras, of those Sutras,\nwhich, more than others, touch on the essential points of the Vedanta system\n1. This\n\np. xxiv\n\nwill best be done in connexion with a succinct but full review of the topics\ndiscussed in the adhikara _n_ as of the Vedanta-sutras, according to _S_ a _n_\nkara; a review which--apart from the side-glances at Ramanu _g_ a's comments--\nwill be useful as a guide through the Sutras and the _S_ a _n_ kara-bhashya.\nBefore, however, entering on that task, I think it advisable to insert short\nsketches of the philosophical systems of _S_ a _n_ kara as well as of Ramanu\n_g_ a, which may be referred to when, later on discrepancies between the two\ncommentators will be noted. In these sketches I shall confine myself to the\nleading features, and not enter into any details. Of _S_ a _n_ kara's system\nwe possess as it. is more than one trustworthy exposition; it may suffice to\nrefer to Deussen's System of the Vedanta, in which the details of the entire\nsystem, as far as they can be learned from the Sutra-bhashya, are represented\nfully and faithfully, and to Gough's Philosophy of the Upanishads which,\nprincipally in its second chapter, gives a lucid sketch of the _S_ a _n_ kara\nVedanta, founded on the Sutra-bhashya, the Upanishad bhashyas, and some later\nwriters belonging to _S_ a _n_ kara's school. With regard to Ramanu _g_ a's\nphilosophy our chief source was, hitherto, the Ramanu _g_ a chapter in the\nSarvadar _s_ a _n_ asa _m_ graha; the short sketch about to be given is\nfounded altogether on the _S_ ri-bhashya itself.\n\nWhat in _S_ a _n_ kara's opinion the Upanishads teach, is shortly as follows.\n--Whatever is, is in reality one; there truly exists only one universal being\ncalled Brahman or Paramatman, the highest Self This being is of an absolutely\nhomogeneous nature; it is pure 'Being,' or, which comes to the same, pure\nintelligence or thought ( _k_ aitanya,\n\np. xxv\n\n_\n\ng\xc3\xb1_ana). Intelligence or thought is not to be predicated of Brahman as its\nattribute, but constitutes its substance, Brahman is not a thinking being, but\nthought itself. It is absolutely destitute of qualities; whatever qualities or\nattributes are conceivable, can only be denied of it.--But, if nothing exists\nbut one absolutely simple being, whence the appearance of the world by which\nwe see ourselves surrounded, and, in which we ourselves exist as individual\nbeings?--Brahman, the answer runs, is associated with a certain power called\nMaya or avidya to which the appearance of this entire world is due. This power\ncannot be called 'being' (sat), for 'being' is only Brahman; nor can it be\ncalled 'non-being' (asat) in the strict sense, for it at any rate produces the\nappearance of this world. It is in fact a principle of illusion; the\nundefinable cause owing to which there seems to exist a material world\ncomprehending distinct individual existences. Being associated with this\nprinciple of illusion, Brahman is enabled to project the appearance of the\nworld, in the same way as a magician is enabled by his incomprehensible\nmagical power to produce illusory appearances of animate and inanimate beings.\nMaya thus constitutes the upadana, the material cause of the world; or--if we\nwish to call attention to the circumstance that Maya belongs to Brahman as a\n_s_ akti--we may say that the material cause of the world is Brahman in so far\nas it is associated with Maya. In this latter quality Brahman is more properly\ncalled \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, the Lord.\n\nMaya, under the guidance of the Lord, modifies itself by a progressive\nevolution into all the individual existences (bheda), distinguished by special\nnames and forms, of which the world consists; from it there spring in due\nsuccession the different material elements and the whole bodily apparatus\nbelonging to sentient Beings. In all those apparently, individual forms of\nexistence the one indivisible Brahman is present, but, owing to the particular\nadjuncts into which Maya has specialised itself, it appears to be broken up--\nit is broken up, as it were--into a multiplicity, of intellectual or sentient\nprinciples, the so-called _g_ ivas (individual or personal souls). What is\nreal in each\n\np. xxvi\n\n_\n\ng_iva is only the universal Brahman itself; the whole aggregate of\nindividualising bodily organs and mental functions, which in our ordinary\nexperience separate and distinguish one _g_ iva from another, is the offspring\nof Maya and as such unreal.\n\nThe phenomenal world or world of ordinary experience (vyavahara) thus consists\nof a number of individual souls engaged in specific cognitions, volitions, and\nso on, and of the external material objects with which those cognitions and\nvolitions are concerned. Neither the specific cognitions nor their objects are\nreal in the true sense of the word, for both are altogether due to Maya. But\nat the same time we have to reject the idealistic doctrine of certain Bauddha\nschools according to which nothing whatever truly exists, but certain trains\nof cognitional acts or ideas to which no external objects correspond; for\nexternal things, although not real in the strict sense of the word, enjoy at\nany rate as much reality as the specific cognitional acts whose objects they\nare.\n\nThe non-enlightened soul is unable to look through and beyond Maya, which,\nlike a veil, hides from it its true nature. Instead of recognising itself to\nbe Brahman, it blindly identifies itself with its adjuncts (upadhi), the\nfictitious offspring of Maya, and thus looks for its true Self in the body,\nthe sense organs, and the internal organ (manas), i.e. the organ of specific\ncognition. The soul, which in reality is pure intelligence, non-active,\ninfinite, thus becomes limited in extent, as it were, limited in knowledge and\npower, an agent and enjoyer. Through its actions it burdens itself with merit\nand demerit, the consequences of which it has to bear or enjoy in series of\nfuture embodied existences, the Lord--as a retributor and dispenser--allotting\nto each soul that form of embodiment to which it is entitled by its previous\nactions. At the end of each of the great world periods called kalpas the Lord\nretracts the whole world, i.e. the whole material world is dissolved and\nmerged into non-distinct Maya, while the individual souls, free for the time\nfrom actual connexion with upadhis, lie in deep slumber as it were. But as the\n\np. xxvii\n\nconsequences of their former deeds are not yet exhausted, they have again to\nenter on embodied existence as soon as the Lord sends forth a new material\nworld, and the old round of birth, action, death begins anew to last to all\neternity as it has lasted from all eternity.\n\nThe means of escaping from this endless sa _ms_ ara, the way out of which can\nnever be found by the non-enlightened soul, are furnished by the Veda. The\nkarmaka _nd_ a indeed, whose purport it is to enjoin certain actions, cannot\nlead to final release; for even the most meritorious works necessarily lead to\nnew forms of embodied existence. And in the _g \xc3\xb1_anaka _nd_ a of the Veda also\ntwo different parts have to be distinguished, viz., firstly, those chapters\nand passages which treat of Brahman in so far as related to the world, and\nhence characterised by various attributes, i.e. of \xc3\x8e _s_ vara or the lower\nBrahman; and, secondly, those texts which set forth the nature of the highest\nBrahman transcending all qualities, and the fundamental identity of the\nindividual soul with that highest Brahman. Devout meditation on Brahman as\nsuggested by passages of the former kind does not directly lead to final\nemancipation; the pious worshipper passes on his death into the world of the\nlower Brahman only, where he continues to exist as a distinct individual soul\n--although in the enjoyment of great power and knowledge--until at last he\nreaches the highest knowledge, and, through it, final release.--That student\nof the Veda, on the other hand, whose soul has been enlightened by the texts\nembodying the higher knowledge of Brahman, whom passages such as the great\nsaying, 'That art thou,' have taught that there is no difference between his\ntrue Self and the highest Self, obtains at the moment of death immediate final\nrelease, i.e. he withdraws altogether from the influence of Maya, and asserts\nhimself in his true nature, which is nothing else but the absolute highest\nBrahman.\n\nThus _S_ a _n_ kara.--According to Ramanuga, on the other hand, the teaching\nof the Upanishads has to be summarised as follows.--There exists only one all-\nembracing being called Brahman or the highest Self of the Lord. This being is\n\np. xxviii\n\nnot destitute of attributes, but rather endowed with all imaginable auspicious\nqualities. It is not 'intelligence,'--as _S_ a _n_ kara maintains,--but\nintelligence is its chief attribute. The Lord is all-pervading, all-powerful,\nall-knowing, all-merciful; his nature is fundamentally antagonistic to all\nevil. He contains within himself whatever exists. While, according to _S_ a\n_n_ kara, the only reality is to be found in the non-qualified homogeneous\nhighest Brahman which can only be defined as pure 'Being' or pure thought, all\nplurality being a mere illusion; Brahman--according to Ramanu _g_ a's view--\ncomprises within itself distinct elements of plurality which all of them lay\nclaim to absolute reality of one and the same kind. Whatever is presented to\nus by ordinary experience, viz. matter in all its various modifications and\nthe individual souls of different classes and degrees, are essential real\nconstituents of Brahman's nature. Matter and souls (a _k_ it and _k_ it)\nconstitute, according to Ramanu _g_ a's terminology, the body of the Lord;\nthey stand to him in the same relation of entire dependence and subserviency\nin which the matter forming an animal or vegetable body stands to its soul or\nanimating principle. The Lord pervades and rules all things which exist--\nmaterial or immaterial--as their antaryamin; the fundamental text for this\nspecial Ramanu _g_ a tenet--which in the writings of the sect is quoted again\nand again--is the so-called antaryamin brahma _n_ a. (B _ri_. Up. Ill, 7)\nwhich says, that within all elements, all sense organs, and, lastly, within\nall individual souls, there abides an inward ruler whose body those elements,\nsense-organs, and individual souls constitute.--Matter and souls as forming\nthe body of the Lord are also called modes of him (prakara). They are to be\nlooked upon as his effects, but they have enjoyed the kind of individual\nexistence which is theirs from all eternity, and will never be entirely\nresolved into Brahman. They, however, exist in two different, periodically\nalternating, conditions. At some times they exist in a subtle state in which\nthey do not possess those qualities by which they are ordinarily known, and\nthere is then no distinction of individual name and form. Matter in that state\nis unevolved (avyakta); the\n\np. xxix\n\nindividual souls are not joined to material bodies, and their intelligence is\nin a state of contraction, non-manifestation (sa _n_ ko _k_ a). This is the\npralaya state which recurs at the end of each kalpa, and Brahman is then said\nto be in its causal condition (kara _n_ avastha). To that state all those\nscriptural passages refer which speak of Brahman or the Self as being in the\nbeginning one only, without a second. Brahman then is indeed not absolutely\none, for it contains within itself matter and souls in a germinal condition;\nbut as in that condition they are so subtle as not to allow of individual\ndistinctions being made, they are not counted as something second in addition\nto Brahman.--When the pralaya state comes to an end, creation takes place\nowing to an act of volition on the Lord's part. Primary unevolved matter then\npasses over into its other condition; it becomes gross and thus acquires all\nthose sensible attributes, visibility, tangibility, and so on, which are known\nfrom ordinary experience. At the same time the souls enter into connexion with\nmaterial bodies corresponding to the degree of merit or demerit acquired by\nthem in previous forms of existence; their intelligence at the same time\nundergoes a certain expansion (vika _s_ a). The Lord, together with matter in\nits gross state and the 'expanded' souls, is Brahman in the condition of an\neffect (karyavastha). Cause and effect are thus at the bottom the same; for\nthe effect is nothing but the cause which has undergone a certain change (pari\n_n_ ama). Hence the cause being known, the effect is known likewise.\n\nOwing to the effects of their former actions the individual souls are\nimplicated in the sa _m_ sara, the endless cycle of birth, action, and death,\nfinal escape from which is to be obtained only through the study of the _g\n\xc3\xb1_anaka _nd_ a of the Veda. Compliance with the injunctions of the karmaka\n_nd_ a docs not lead outside the sa _m_ sara; but he who, assisted by the\ngrace of the Lord, cognizes--and meditates on-him in the way prescribed by the\nUpanishads reaches at his death final emancipation, i.e. he passes through the\ndifferent stages of the path of the gods up to the world of Brahman and there\nenjoys an\n\np. xxx\n\neverlasting blissful existence from which there is no return into the sphere\nof transmigration. The characteristics of the released soul are similar to\nthose of Brahman; it participates in all the latter's glorious qualities and\npowers, excepting only Brahman's power to emit, rule, and retract the entire\nworld.\n\nThe chief points in which the two systems sketched above agree on the one hand\nand diverge on the other may be shortly stated as follows.--Both systems teach\nadvaita, i.e. non-duality or monism. There exist not several fundamentally\ndistinct principles, such as the prak _ri_ ti and the purushas of the Sa _n_\nkhyas, but there exists only one all-embracing being. While, however, the\nadvaita taught by _S_ a _n_ kara is a rigorous, absolute one, Ramanu _g_ a's\ndoctrine has to be characterised as visish _t_ a advaita, i.e. qualified non-\nduality, non-duality with a difference. According to _S_ a _n_ kara, whatever\nis, is Brahman, and Brahman itself is absolutely homogeneous, so that all\ndifference and plurality must be illusory. According to Ramanu _g_ a also,\nwhatever is, is Brahman; but Brahman is not of a homogeneous nature, but\ncontains within itself elements of plurality owing to which it truly manifests\nitself in a diversified world. The world with its variety of material forms of\nexistence and individual souls is not unreal Maya, but a real part of\nBrahman's nature, the body investing the universal Self. The Brahman of _S_ a\n_n_ kara is in itself impersonal, a homogeneous mass of objectless thought,\ntranscending all attributes; a personal God it becomes only through its\nassociation with the unreal principle of Maya, so that-strictly speaking-- _S_\na _n_ kara's personal God, his \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, is himself something unreal. Ramanu\n_g_ a's Brahman, on the other hand, is essentially a personal God, the all-\npowerful and all-wise ruler of a real world permeated and animated by his\nspirit. There is thus no room for the distinction between a param nirgu _n_ am\nand an apara _m_ sagu _n_ am brahma, between Brahman and \xc3\x8e _s_ vara.-- _S_ a\n_n_ kara's individual soul is Brahman in so far as limited by the unreal\nupadhis due to Maya. The individual soul of Ramanu _g_ a, on the other hand,\nis really individual; it has\n\np. xxxi\n\nindeed sprung from Brahman and is never outside Brahman, but nevertheless it\nenjoys a separate personal existence and will remain a personality for ever.--\nThe release from sa _m_ sara means, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, the absolute\nmerging of the individual soul in Brahman, due to the dismissal of the\nerroneous notion that the soul is distinct from Brahman; according to Ramanu\n_g_ a it only means the soul's passing from the troubles of earthly life into\na kind of heaven or paradise where it will remain for ever in undisturbed\npersonal bliss.--As Ramanu _g_ a does not distinguish a higher and lower\nBrahman, the distinction of a higher and lower knowledge is likewise not valid\nfor him; the teaching of the Upanishads is not twofold but essentially one,\nand leads the enlightened devotee to one result only 1.\n\nI now proceed to give a conspectus of the contents of the Vedanta-sutras\naccording to _S_ a _n_ kara in which at the same time all the more important\npoints concerning which Ramanu _g_ a disagrees will be noted. We shall here\nhave to enter into details which to many may appear tedious. But it is only on\na broad substratum of accurately stated details that we can hope to establish\nany definite conclusions regarding the comparative value of the different\nmodes of interpretation which have been applied to the Sutras. The line of\ninvestigation is an entirely new one, and for the present nothing can be taken\nfor granted or known.--In stating the different heads of discussion (the so-\ncalled adhikara _n_ as), each of which comprises one or more Sutras, I shall\nfollow the subdivision into adhikara _n_ as adopted in the Vyasadhika-ra _n_\namala, the text of which is printed in the second volume of the Bibliotheca\nIndica edition of the Sutras.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xiv:1](sbe34002.htm#fr_0) The Sutras in which the _g \xc3\xb1_anaka _nd_ a of the\nVeda is systematised go by various names, being called either Vedanta-sutras,\nor Uttara Mima _m_ sa-sutras, or Brahma-sutras, or _S_ ariraka Mima _m_ sa-\nsutras.\n\n[xxii:1](sbe34002.htm#fr_1) The name of this writer is sometimes given as\nDrami _d_ a, sometimes as Dravi _d_ a. In the opinion of Pa _nd_ it Rama Mi\n_s_ ra _S_ astrin of the Benares College--himself a Ramanu _g_ a and\nthoroughly conversant with the books and traditions of his sect--the form\n'Drami _d_ a' is the correct one.\n\n[xxii:2](sbe34002.htm#fr_2) Viz. by Pa _nd_ it Rama Mi _s_ ra _S_ astrin. As\nthe Pa _nd_ it intends himself to publish all the traditional information he\npossesses concerning the history of the Bhagavatas and Ramanu _g_ as, I limit\nmyself in the text to stating the most relevant results of my study of the _S_\nri-bhashya and the Vedarthasa _n_ graha.\n\n[xxiii:1](sbe34002.htm#fr_3) Owing to the importance of the _S_ a _n_ kara-\nbhashya as the fundamental work of the most influential Hindu school of\nphilosophy, the number of topics, which might be discussed in the introduction\nto its translation is considerable. But p. xxiv the limitation of the space at\nour disposal necessitates a selection, and it can hardly be doubted that,\namong the possible tasks of a translator, that of ascertaining how far the\nteaching of _S_ a _n_ kara agrees with that of Badaraya _n_ a, and, further,\nhow far either of them represents the true doctrine of the Upanishads, is the\none first to be. taken in hand.--Some other topics, such as a detailed account\nof _S_ a _n_ kara's teaching according to the bhashya, an enquiry as to the\nbooks and authors quoted by _S_ a _n_ kara, &c., have, moreover, been treated\nnot long ago in a very thorough fashion by Dr Deussen in his 'System des\nVedanta.'\n\n[xxxi:1](sbe34002.htm#fr_4) The only 'sectarian' feature of the _S_ ri-bhashya\nis, that identifies Brahman with Vishnu or Naraya _n_ a; but this in no way\naffects the interpretations put on the Sutras and Upanishads. Naraya _n_ a is\nin fact nothing but another name of Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: First Adhyaya](sbe34003.htm)\n\n"
