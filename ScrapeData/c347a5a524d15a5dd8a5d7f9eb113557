There is injunction of other auxiliary means for him who is such, as in\nthe case of injunction and so on; (the term _mauna_ denoting) according to an\nalternative meaning a third something.\n\np. 709\n\n\'Therefore let a Brahma _n_ a after he has done with learning wish to stand by\na childlike state; and after having done with the childlike state and learning\n(he is) a Muni\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 5). A doubt arises whether this text enjoins\nMuni-hood in the same way as it enjoins learning and the childlike state, or\nmerely refers to it as something already established.--The Purvapakshin holds\nthe latter view on the ground that as \'Muni-hood\' and \'learning\' both connote\nknowledge, the word \'Muni\' merely refers back to the knowledge already\nenjoined in the phrase \'after he has done with learning.\' For the text\npresents no word of injunctive force with regard to Muni-hood.--This view the\nSutra controverts. \'For him who is such,\' i.e. for those who possess\nknowledge, \'there is an injunction of a different co-operative factor \' \'in\nthe same way as injunctions and the rest.\' By the _injunctions_ in the last\nclause we have to understand the special duties of the different a _s_ ramas,\ni.e. sacrifices and the like, and also such qualifications as quietness of\nmind and the like; and by the \'and the rest\' is meant the learning of and\npondering on the sacred texts. Stated at length, the meaning of the Sutra then\nis as follows--in the same way as texts such as \'him Brahma _n_ as seek to\nknow through the reciting of the Veda, through sacrifices and charity, and so\non,\' and \'Quiet, subdued,\' &c. (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 23) enjoin sacrifices and\nso on, and quietness of mind and the like, as helpful towards knowledge; and\nas texts such as \'the Self is to be heard, to be pondered upon\' (B _ri_. Up.\nII, 4, 5) mention hearing and pondering as helpful towards knowledge; thus the\ntext under discussion enjoins learning, a childlike state of mind, and Muni-\nhood as three further different auxiliaries of knowledge.--\'Muni-hood\' does\n_not_ denote the same thing as \'learning\'--this the Sutra intimates by the\nclause \'alternatively a third,\' i.e. as the word muni is observed\nalternatively to denote persons such as Vyasa distinguished by their power of\nprofound reflection (manana), the abstract term munihood denotes a third thing\ndifferent from _learning_ and the \'childlike state.\' Hence, although the\nphrase \'then a Muni\' does not contain a word of directly\n\np. 710\n\ninjunctive power, we must all the same understand it in an injunctive sense,\nviz. \'then let him be or become a Muni\'; for Muni-hood is not something\npreviously established. Such munihood is also something different from mere\n_reflection_ (manana); it is the reiterated representation before the mind of\nthe object of meditation, the idea of that object thus becoming more and more\nvivid. The meaning of the entire text therefore is as follows. A Brahma _n_ a\nis at first fully to master knowledge, i.e. he is to attain, by means of\nhearing and pondering, to the knowledge of Brahman in all its fulness and\nperfection. This is to be effected through the growth of purity of mind and\nheart, due to the grace of the Lord; for this Sm _ri_ ti declares, \'Neither by\nthe Vedas nor by austerities, and so on, can I be so seen--; but by devotion\nexclusive I may be known\' (Bha. Gi. XI, 53-54); and Scripture also says, "Who\nhas the highest devotion for God\'( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 23), and \'That Self cannot\nbe gained by the study of the Veda,\' &c. \'He whom the Self chooses by him the\nSelf is to be attained\' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 23). After that \'he is to stand by a\nchildlike state\'; what this means will be explained further on. And after that\nhe is to be a Muni, i.e. he is to fix his thoughts so exclusively and\npersistently on Brahman as to attain to the mode of knowledge called\nmeditation. Having by the employment of these three means reached true\nknowledge he--the text goes on to say--having done with amauna and mauna is a\nBrahma _n_ a. Amauna, i.e. non-mauna, denotes all the auxiliaries of knowledge\ndifferent from mauna: employing these and mauna as well he reaches the highest\ngoal of knowledge. And, the text further says, there is no other means but\nthose stated whereby to become such, i.e. a true Brahma _n_ a. The entire text\nthus evidently means to enjoin on any one standing within any a _s_ rama\nlearning, a childlike state, and mauna as auxiliary means of knowledge, in\naddition to sacrifices and the other special duties of the a _s_ ramas.--But,\nan objection is raised, if knowledge, aided by pa _n_ ditya. and so on, and\nthus being auxiliary to the action of the special duties of the a _s_ ramas,\nis thus declared to be the\n\np. 711\n\nmeans of attaining to Brahman; how then are we to understand the _Kh_\nandogya\'s declaring that a man. in order to attain to Brahman, is throughout\nhis life to carry on the duties of a householder 1?--To this the next Sutra\nreplies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[711:1](sbe48492.htm#fr_43) _Kh_.
