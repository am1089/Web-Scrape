Subrahmanyam, [1911], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 83\n\n### CHAPTER X.\n\n#### The Collecting of the Bones from the Fire.\n\n1\\. Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: Tell me, O Lord, the rites for burning the bodies of the\ngood, and describe also the greatness of the wife who is faithful.\n\n2\\. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya. I will tell you all about the\nceremonies for the upper body, by doing which sons and grandsons are released\nfrom the hereditary debt.\n\n3\\. There is no need for numerous gifts, but one should perform the funeral\nceremonies for his parents; the son who does so obtains fruit like that of the\nAgni\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\xadoma. 1\n\n4-6. Then the son, abandoning sorrow, should have the shave, along with all\nhis relatives, in order to remove all sins.\n\nThe son who does not have the shave when the mother or father has died,--how\ncan he be called a son, the helper through the ocean of changefulness.\n\nTherefore he must have the shave by all means, except the nails and the hair\nof the armpits. Then, having bathed with his relatives he must put on clean\ncloths.\n\np. 84\n\n7-9. Then, bringing river water, he should bathe the corpse and next adorn it\nwith sandal-paste, garlands, or the clay of the Ganges;\n\nHaving covered it with new cloths he, with his sacred thread on the right\nshoulder, should pronounce the family name, and dedicate rice-balls and\npresents,\n\nAt the place of death, in the name of the so-called dead, he should offer\nthem. By this the earth and its presiding deity become pleased.\n\n10\\. \xe1\xb8\xa4e should wake offering at the threshold in the name of him who is become\na traveller; by this the evil ones amongst the tens of millions of elementals\ncan do no harm.\n\n11-13. Then the daughter-in-law 1 and others should go round it and worship\nit; then along with the other relatives the son should bear it on his\nshoulder.\n\nThe son who bears his father on his shoulder to the burning-ground obtains the\nfruit of the horse-sacrifice at every step.\n\nHe who carries his dead father on shoulder or back or hip pays off the debt of\nconstant parental kindnesses.\n\n14\\. Then, half-way, after cleaning and sprinkling, he should make a halt.\nHaving bathed the corpse, he should make an offering for him.\n\np. 85\n\n15\\. Oblations should be made in order that goblins, demons and fiends, and\nothers in the various directions, shall not cause disturbance of that body\nwhich is to be sacrificed.\n\n16-19. Then it should be taken to the burning-ground, and laid down with its\nhead to the north. Some place should be cleaned there, for the burning of the\nbody, as follows:\n\nHaving swept the ground and washed it with cow-dung, having taken out some\nearth and erected an altar and sprinkled it with water, and having placed the\nfire as prescribed,\n\nAnd having worshipped with flowers and coloured rice the Shining One known as\nthe eater of flesh, 1 he should make an oblation as prescribed, beginning with\n\'loman,\'--\n\n"Oh, Thou, Supporter of Beings, Womb of the World, Nourisher of Creatures.\nThis one belonging to the changing world is dead; lead Thou him to heaven!"\n\n20-22. Having thus prayed to the fire, he should make there a funeral pyre\nwith sandal wood, the holy bath wood, and with the wood of pal\xc4\x81sha and\na\xc5\x9bwattha.\n\nHaving placed the departed on the funeral pyre, he should offer in the name of\nthe departed two rice ball; in the hand of the dead,\n\np. 86\n\non the funeral pyre. From the time he is released on the funeral pyre the\ncondition as departed begins.\n\nThose who know the ways of the departed call him a seeker. An offering should\nbe made on the funeral pyre, either in this name, or in that of Departed.\n\n23\\. Thus the dead gets the benefit of the offering of five rice-balls;\notherwise the above-mentioned come to disturb.\n\n24\\. The son, having dedicated five rice-balls to the departed, and having\nbrought the oblation with the grasses, should give them to the fire, if there\nis not Pa\xc3\xb1chaka. 1\n\n25-27. Who dies in the Pa\xc3\xb1chaka does not attain a good condition. Burning\nshould not be done then; if it is done, another death occurs.\n\nBeginning from the middle of Dhani\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81, in the five Pa\xc3\xb1chaka mansions ending\nwith Revat\xc4\xab 2 is not a suitable time for burning. If burning takes place, evil\noccurs.\n\nHarm befalls the house in which death takes place in the Rik\xe1\xb9\xa3a mansion, and\nsome trouble arises for the sons and family.\n\n28\\. I will explain to you the rites for the warding off of all ills, in case\nburning takes place in the middle of Rik\xe1\xb9\xa3a.\n\np. 87\n\n20-33. Then one should place near the corpse images, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, make of darbha\ngrass, and consecrated with the four Rik\xe1\xb9\xa3a mantras.\n\nPurified gold should be used, and sacrifice performed with Rik\xe1\xb9\xa3a mantras, with\nthe mantra "Pret\xc4\x81jayata," and with leaf-vessels.\n\nThen the burning along with the images should be done, and the son, on the day\nof the offering of the rice-balls, should perform the pacificatory rites for\nhim.\n\nFor warding off ills he should give a vessel full of sesamum, gold, silver,\ndiamonds, and a bronze vessel filled with clarified butter, in order.\n\nWho, after having thus performed the pacificatory ceremonies, does the\nburning,--no harm befalls him; and the departed goes to the supreme condition.\n\n 87-34\n\n 87-35\n\np. 88\n\n 88-41\n\n 88-42\n\n 88-46\n\np. 89\n\n 89-48\n\n 89-53\n\np. 90\n\n56-50. Whether half or wholly burnt, his skull should be split open, in the\ncase of householders with a piece of wood, in that of ascetics with a\ncocoanut.\n\nHis son, so that he may attain the world of the forefathers, having split open\nthe brahmarandra 1 should make an oblation of clarified butter with this\nmantra:\n\n"Thou art born from him; 2 may he be born again from you. He is an offering to\nthe heaven-world. O Fire, blaze forth!"\n\nThus having made an oblation of clarified butter, with mantras and sesamum\nofferings, he should weep loudly, that he may become happy\n\n60-61. When the burning is finished the women should bathe, then the sons, and\noffer water mixed with sesamum, in the name of the family.\n\nHe should eat the leaves of the nimba-tree and recount the virtues of the\ndead. They should walk home, the women in front and the men behind.\n\n62\\. Having bathed again at home, he should give food to a cow and eat-from a\nleaf-plate--but not any food already in the house.\n\n63\\. Having cleaned the place of death with cow-dung, he should keep a lamp\nburning there, turned to the south, up to the twelfth day.\n\np. 91\n\n34-66. For three days, at sunset, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, he should offer, at the cross-\nroads or on the burning-ground, milk and water in an earthen pot.\n\nHolding the unbaked earthen pot, filled with milk and water, bound with-three\nsticks, he should repeat this mantra:\n\n"Thou hast been burned with the fires of the burning-ground. Thou hast been\nforsaken by relatives. Here is milk and here water; bathe and drink!"\n\n67\\. On the fourth day the collection 1 should be made, by those who maintain\nhousehold fires, and by those who do not. If there is nothing to prevent, on\nthe second or the third day he should do as follows:\n\np. 92\n\n68-78. Having gone to the burning-ground, having bathed and become pure,\nhaving put on a woollen garment, and wearing the sacred ring, 1\n\nThe son should make the grain oblation to the denizens of the burning-ground,\nand walk round three times, repeating the mantra beginning with "Yam\xc4\x81yatva."\n\nThen having sprinkled milk over the place of the funeral pyre, O Lord of\nBirds, he should sprinkle water, and begin to pick up the heap of bones.\n\nHaving placed them on palasha leaves, he should sprinkle them with milk and\nwater, and, having put them into an earthen pot, perform \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha as\nprescribed.\n\nHaving prepared a triangular plot of ground, and cleansed it with cow-dung,\nhe, facing south, should offer three rice-balls, in the three directions.\n\nHaving collected the ashes from the pyre, taking a three-legged stool he\nshould place on it a jar with mouth uncovered, containing water.\n\nThen he should make, for the departed, an oblation of cooked rice with curds\nand clarified butter, water and sweetmeats, as prescribed.\n\nHe should take fifteen steps in the northerly direction and, digging a hole\nthere, place in it, O Bird, the jar of bones.\n\nThen he should offer over it a rice-ball, which destroys the pain of burning,\nand, taking the vessel from the hole, carry it to a tank of water.\n\nThen he should several times sprinkle the bones with water and milk, and\nworship them well, with sandal-paste and saffron.\n\nHaving put them into a leaf-box, touched with it his heart and head and walked\nround it saluting it; he should drop it into the middle of the Ganges.\n\np. 93\n\n79-84. He whose bones sink in the water of the Ganges within ten days, never\nreturns from the world of Brahma.\n\nAs long as a man\'s bones float on the water of the Ganges,--for so many\nthousands of years he remains in the heaven-world.\n\nWhen the wind which has touched the waves of the Ganges touches the dead, his\nsin is at once destroyed.\n\nHaving worshipped, with great austerities, the divine Ganges, for the\nuplifting of his forefathers, Bhag\xc4\xabratha 1 brought her down from the world of\nBrahm\xc4\x81.\n\nIn the three worlds is celebrated the purifying fame of the Ganges, who led to\nheaven the sons of Sagara 2 who had been reduced to ashes.\n\nThose men who die after committing sins attain the heaven-world by their bones\nfalling into the Ganges.\n\n85-86. There was a certain hunter, a destroyer of all sorts of creatures who,\nkilled by a lion in a great forest, went to the place called hell.\n\nWhen his bones were dropped into the Ganges by a crow he ascended the divine\nchariot and went to the abode of the Shining Ones.\n\n87\\. Hence the good son should himself drop the bones in the Ganges. After the\nbones are collected he should perform the ten-days\' ceremonies.\n\np. 94\n\n88-90. Now, if anybody meets his death in an uninhabited place, or in a wood,\nor from dangerous thieves, and if his body is not found, then, on the day this\nis heard of--\n\nHaving made an effigy of darbha grass, one should burn it alone, as explained\nabove, and then collect its ashes and drop them into the water of the Ganges,\n\nAnd from the same day the ten-days\' [ceremonies](errata.htm#7) should be\nperformed and that date should be noted, for the performance of the annual\n\xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha.\n\n91\\. If a woman dies in the fulness of pregnancy, her womb should be cut open,\nand the child drawn out and placed on the ground, and she alone be burned.\n\n92-93. If a child dies on the bank of the Ganges, it should simply be thrown\ninto the Ganges; if in another place, it should be buried in the ground, up to\ntwenty-seven months old.\n\nOlder than that it should be burned and its bones strewn on the Ganges. A gift\nof a water-pot should be made, and food should be given to children.\n\np. 95\n\n94-98. If the embryo perishes, there are no rites. If an infant dies, one\nshould give milk. if a child dies, then one should offer a jar, milk-porridge\nand eatables.\n\nIf a youth dies, one should have young children fed. If a youth who has taken\nthe vow dies, one should have Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s, along with children, fed.\n\nWhen one who has passed five years dies, whether vowed or not, one should\noffer ten rice-balls, along with milk-food and lumps of sugar.\n\nOn the eleventh and twelfth days one should perform the ceremonies for a\nyouth, but without the rites of releasing a bull and of the great gift.\n\nIf the father is living, there is not joint rite for the youth, but on the\ntwelfth day one should perform the ceremony for him alone.\n\n99\\. Marriage, with women and \xc5\x9a\xc5\xabdras, is declared to take the place of vows.\nPrevious to the taking of vows, with all the castes, rites are done according\nto age.\n\n100\\. He who is little attached to action, who is little bound by sense-\nobjects, and he who is young in age of body, requires but scanty rites.\n\n101\\. In boyhood and in youth the cot, the bull and other sacrifices should be\nperformed; and the gifts of land, the great gift and the gift of a cow should\nbe made.\n\np. 96\n\n102-107. With all ascetics there is no burning, no water rites; and the ten-\ndays\' ceremonies should not be performed for them by their sons.\n\nA man, by the mere holding of the staff, becomes N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a 1; because of\ncarrying the three-fold staff they never go into the condition of the\ndeparted.\n\nThose who know are always free, by realisation of their own true nature, hence\nthey do not expect rice-balls to be given.\n\nTherefore rice-balls and water should not be offered to them, but one should\nperform the annual \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha at the sacred waters, and \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha at Gay\xc4\x81, with\ndevotion to the forefathers.\n\nThe Ha\xe1\xb9\x85sa, Paramaha\xe1\xb9\x85sa, Kut\xc4\xabchaka, Bah\xc5\xabdaka; these are Sanny\xc4\x81sins, 2 O\nT\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, and when dead, they must be buried in the ground.\n\nIf the Ganges, or other, is not available, it is declared that they should be\nburied in the ground. Where great rivers exist, they should be thrown into\nthem.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[83:1](gpu12.htm#fr_95) A certain sacrifice.\n\n[84:1](gpu12.htm#fr_96) His son\'s wife--the wife of the son performing the\nrite.\n\n[85:1](gpu12.htm#fr_97) The fire-deva.\n\n[86:1](gpu12.htm#fr_98) A certain astrological position; 5 days in each month.\n\n[86:2](gpu12.htm#fr_99) The fifth Nak\xe1\xb9\xa3atra.\n\n[87:87-34](gpu12.htm#fr_100) ![](img/08700.jpg)\n\n[87:87-35](gpu12.htm#fr_101) ![](img/08701.jpg)\n\n[88:88-41](gpu12.htm#fr_102) ![](img/08800.jpg)\n\n[88:88-42](gpu12.htm#fr_103) ![](img/08801.jpg)\n\n[88:88-46](gpu12.htm#fr_104) ![](img/08802.jpg)\n\n[89:89-48](gpu12.htm#fr_105) ![](img/08900.jpg)\n\n[89:89-53](gpu12.htm#fr_106) ![](img/08900.jpg)\n\n[90:1](gpu12.htm#fr_107) An opening at the top of the head.\n\n[90:2](gpu12.htm#fr_108) The funeral pyre is lighted from the sacred household\nfire.\n\n[91:1](gpu12.htm#fr_109) Of the bones.\n\n[92:1](gpu12.htm#fr_110) A finger-ring of kusha grass, put on the third finger\nof right hand.\n\n[93:1](gpu12.htm#fr_111) A great king who is said to have brought down the\nGanges from heaven to earth.\n\n[93:2](gpu12.htm#fr_112) There is a legend to the effect that the 80,000 sons\nof Sagara were reduced to ashes by Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, and that they, the ancestors of\nBhrigu, were released and purified by him in the Ganges.\n\n[96:1](gpu12.htm#fr_113) Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\n[96:2](gpu12.htm#fr_114) These names are given to advanced stages of human\ndevelopment.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI.
