Now these five great sacrifices, which are also called the great\nsacrificial sessions, are the sacrifice to be offered to the gods, the\nsacrifice to be offered to the manes, the sacrifice to be offered to all\nbeings, the sacrifice to be offered to men, (and) the sacrifice to be offered\nto Brahman, 1\n\n2\\. Let him daily offer (something to the gods with the exclamation) Svaha, be\nit only a piece of fuel. Thereby he performs that sacrifice to the gods.\n\n3\\. Let him daily offer (something to the manes with the exclamation) Svadha,\nbe it only a vessel filled with water. Thereby he performs that sacrifice to\nthe manes.\n\n4\\. Let him daily pay reverence to (all beings) endowed with life. Thereby he\nperforms that sacrifice to the beings. 4\n\np. 257\n\n5\\. Let him daily give food to Brahma _n_ as, be it only roots, fruit, or\nvegetables. Thereby he performs that sacrifice to men.\n\n6\\. Let him daily recite the Veda privately, be it only the syllable Om or the\nVyah _ri_ tis. Thereby he performs that sacrifice to be offered to Brahman.\n\n7\\. 'The private recitation of the Veda is, indeed, the sacrifice to Brahman.\nAt that sacrifice to Brahman speech, forsooth, (takes the place of) the _G_\nuhu, the internal organ (that of) the Upabh _ri_ t, the eye (that of) the\nDhruva, the understanding (that of) the Sruva, truth (that of) the final bath,\nheaven (is) the conclusion of the sacrifice. He who, knowing this, daily\nrecites the Veda to himself, gains as much heavenly bliss as, and more than,\nhe who gives away this whole earth that is filled with wealth, and\nimperishable (beatitude), and conquers death. Therefore the Veda should be\nrecited in private. Thus speaks the Brahma _n_ a.' 7\n\n8\\. Now they quote also (the following passage): 'If, well anointed, well fed,\nand lying on a comfortable couch, one recites (the portion of the Veda\nreferring to) any sacrifice, one has offered it thereby.' 8\n\np. 258\n\n9\\. Some (teachers) declare (that there is a text) which teaches a fourfold\ndivision of these sacred duties. (But) as no (other meaning is) perceptible,\n(the text) 'Four paths,' &c., refers to sacrificial rites. 9\n\n10\\. (Viz.) to Ish _t_ is, animal sacrifices, Soma sacrifices, and Darvihomas.\n\n11\\. The following (Rik) declares that, 'Four paths, leading to the world of.\nthe gods, go severally from the earth to heaven. All ye gods, place us on that\namong them which will gain us undecaying prosperity.' 11\n\n12\\. The student, the householder, the hermit in the woods, the ascetic\n(constitute the four orders). 12\n\n13\\. A student (shall) obey his teacher until death.\n\np. 259\n\n14\\. A hermit is he who regulates his conduct entirely according to the\nInstitutes proclaimed by Vikhanas.\n\n15\\. A Vaikhanasa (shall live) in the forest, subsisting on roots and fruit,\npractising austerities and bathing at morn, noon, and eve; he shall kindle a\nfire according to the _S_ rama _n_ aka (rule); he shall eat wild-growing\n(vegetables and grain) only; he shall worship gods, manes, Bhutas, men, and\n_Ri_ shis; he shall receive hospitably (men of) all (castes) except those\n(with whom intercourse is) forbidden; he may even use the flesh of animals\nkilled by carnivorous beasts; he shall not step on ploughed (land); and he\nshall not enter a village; he shall wear his hair in braids, and dress in\n(garments made of) bark or skins; he shall not eat anything that has been\nhoarded for more than a year. 15\n\n16\\. An ascetic shall leave his relatives and, not attended by any one nor\nprocuring any property, depart (from his house performing the customary\nceremony) according to the rule. 16\n\n17\\. He shall go into the forest (and live there).\n\n18\\. He shall shave his hair excepting the top-lock. 18\n\np. 260\n\n19\\. He shall wear a cloth to cover his nakedness.\n\n20\\. He shall reside in one place during the rainy season. 20\n\n21\\. He shall wear a dress dyed yellowish-red.\n\n22\\. He shall go to beg when the pestle lies motionless, when the embers have\nbeen extinguished, and when the cleaning of the dishes has been finished.\n\n23\\. With the three means of punishment, (viz.) words, thoughts, and acts, he\nshall not injure created beings.\n\n24\\. He shall carry a cloth for straining water for the sake of purification.\n24\n\n25\\. He shall perform the necessary purifications with water which has been\ntaken out (of a well or tank) and has been strained. 25\n\n26\\. (Ascetics shall) say, 'Renouncing the works taught in the Veda, cut off\nfrom both (worlds), we attach ourselves to the central sphere (Brahman).' 26\n\n27\\. But the venerable teacher (declares) that there is one order only,\nbecause the others do not beget offspring. 27\n\n28\\. With reference to this matter they quote also (the following passage):\n'There was, forsooth, an \xc3\x82sura, Kapila by name, the son of Prahlada.\n\np. 261\n\nStriving with the gods, he made these divisions. A wise man should not take\nheed of them.'\n\n29\\. Because no (other meaning is) perceptible, (the text) 'Four paths,' &c.,\nrefers to sacrificial rites, (viz.) to Ish _t_ is, animal sacrifices, Soma\nsacrifices, Darvihomas.\n\n30\\. With respect to this (question the following verse also) is quoted: 'That\neternal greatness of the Brahma _n_ a is neither increased by works, nor\ndiminished. The soul knows the nature of that (greatness); knowing that, he is\nnot stained by evil deeds.' 30\n\n31\\. If he says that, (let him reflect on the following verse): 'He who knows\nnot the Veda, does not at death think of that great, all-perceiving soul,\nthrough which the sun, resplendent with brilliancy, gives warmth, and the\nfather has a father through the son at his birth from the womb.'\n\n32\\. (Moreover), 'Those who, being neither true Brahma _n_ as nor performers\nof Soma sacrifices, work not for that which is near, nor for that which is\nfar, take hold of the word and with sinful (speech) ignorantly perform the\nrites.' 32\n\n33\\. There are innumerable (passages in the Veda) which refer to the debts (to\nbe paid by a Brahma _n_ a), such as, 'May I obtain, O Agni, immortality 33\n\np. 262\n\nthrough offspring;' 'A Brahma _n_ a on being born, (owes) a son to his\nancestors,' &c.\n\n34\\. 'Those dwell with us, who fulfil the following (duties), the study of the\nthree Vedas, the studentship, the procreation of offspring, faith, austerity,\nsacrificing, and giving gifts; he who praises other (duties) becomes dust and\nperishes.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[256:1](sbe1465.htm#fr_1241) **11**. This and the next four Sutras agree\nalmost literally with _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a XI, 5, 6, 1. See also Taitt.\n\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka II, 10; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 12, 15-13, 1.\n\n[256:4](sbe1465.htm#fr_1242) Govinda says that the Mantra is to be 'bhutebhyo\nnama _h_ , adoration to all beings,' and adds that some consider the first\nthree p. 257 Mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as to be performed by the Vai _s_ vadeva and the\nBali-offering, while others enjoin their separate performance.\n\n[257:7](sbe1465.htm#fr_1243) _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a XI, 5, 6, z. See also\nTaitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka II, 17. K. reads dh _ri_ tir dhruva, 'the firm resolve\n(takes the place of) the Dhruva,' which is apparently a correction made\naccording to the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. According to the commentary the text of the\nlast portion of the quotation runs thus, 'yavanta _m_ ha va ima _m_ vittasya\npur _n_ a _m_ dadat svarga _m_ loka _m_ _g_ ayati tavanta _m_ loka _m_ _g_\nayati bhuya _m_ sa _m_ _k_ akshayya _m_ _k_ apa m _ri_ tyum _g_ ayati ya eva\n_m_ vidvan,' &c. M. and K. do not give the whole passage. The published text\nof the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a slightly differs from Govinda's version.\n\n[257:8](sbe1465.htm#fr_1244) _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a XI, 5, 7, 3-4.\n\n[258:9](sbe1465.htm#fr_1245) I read the text as follows, 'tasya ha va etasya\ndharmasya _k_ aturdha bhedam eka ahu _h_.' M. has bhedakam, the I. O. copy of\nthe commentary bheda _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kam, and K. tasya ha va etasya ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya _k_\naturdha bhutam eka ahu _h_. Below in the commentary on Sutra 27, Govinda\nrepeats the latter part of this Sutra in the form which I have adopted. The\ndiscussion which begins here is the same as that which occurs \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9,\n23, 3-24, 15.\n\n[258:11](sbe1465.htm#fr_1246) Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita V, 7, 2, 3.\n\n[258:12](sbe1465.htm#fr_1247) K. omits this Sutra. After it M. and K. have the\nfollowing passage: 'brahma _k_ ari _n_ o 'tyantam atmanam upasa _m_ g _ri_ hya\n' _k_ aryan bruvate vane _s_ ramyantyeke [ya _m_ tyete, K.] savaneshvapa upasp\n_ri_ _s_ anto vanyenannenaikagni _m_ [nyenannena naikagni _m_ , K.;\nvanyenaikana\xc3\xb1, M.] _g_ uhvana _h_ [ _g_ uhvas, M.] satyasyaike karma _n_ i\n[karma _n_ i, M.] anagnayo 'niketana _h_ [tva _h_ ka _m_ , K.] kaupina _k_\n_kh_ adana varshasv ekastha uddh _ri_ tapariputabhir adbhi _h_ karya _m_\n[apakarya _m_ , M.] kurvana _h_ [kurva _n_ as tatrodaharanti, K.] sannamusale\nvya\xe1\xb9\x85gare niv _ri_ ttasaravasampate bhikshanta _h_ sarvata _h_ parimoksham\n[parimeke, M.] apavidhya vaidikani karma _n_ y abhayata _h_ pari _k_ _kh_ inna\nmadhyamam padam upa _s_ lishyamaha iti vadanto,' The commentary gives a few\nportions of this passage further on. Irrespective of minor corruptions, it\ngives no sense in the place where it stands, and it seems probable that we\nhave to deal with a confused and badly corrupted text, which Govinda arranged\neither as seemed good to him, or on the authority of better MSS.\n\n[259:15](sbe1465.htm#fr_1248) This passage, which Govinda gives as one Sutra,\nagrees word for word with Gautama III, 26-35, except in the beginning, where\nGautama omits 'bathing at morn, noon, and eve.' The MSS. all read bhaiksham,\n'begged food,' instead of baishkam, 'the flesh of animals slain by carnivorous\nbeasts.' But Govinda's explanation leaves no doubt as to the correctness of\nthe latter reading. The Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS., including K., read\nagramyabho _g_ i || agramyabho _g_ i.\n\n[259:16](sbe1465.htm#fr_1249) I adopt the readings of the Dekhan MSS.,\naparigraha _h_ (for apratigraha _h_ ) and pravra _g_ et (for parivra _g_ et).\nThe rule for the ceremony is given below, II, 10, 17.\n\n[259:18](sbe1465.htm#fr_1250) This is Govinda's explanation of _s_ ikhamu _n_\n_d_ a _h_ , the reading of all MSS.\n\n[260:20](sbe1465.htm#fr_1251) and 22. These two Sutras are omitted in K. and\nM., which give them in the passage following Sutra 12, as well as in the\nDekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS.\n\n[260:24](sbe1465.htm#fr_1252) See below, II, 10, 17, 11. Govinda explains\npavitra, 'a cloth for straining water,' by 'a bunch of Ku _s_ a grass for\nremoving insects from the road.'\n\n[260:25](sbe1465.htm#fr_1253) According to Govinda such water is to be used\nfor washing off the stains of urine &c., not for drinking.\n\n[260:26](sbe1465.htm#fr_1254) This Sutra is again omitted in the MSS, of the\ntext. M. and K. give it in the passage following Sutra 12.\n\n[260:27](sbe1465.htm#fr_1255) Gautama III, 36.\n\n[261:30](sbe1465.htm#fr_1256)-31. Taitt. Brahma _n_ a III, 12, 9, 7.\n\n[261:32](sbe1465.htm#fr_1257) Rig-veda X, 71, 9. My rendering of the difficult\nverse is merely tentative, and I have left out the word siri _h_ , for which I\nam as little able as other Sanskritists to offer a safe explanation, The\ngeneral meaning of the verse, I think, has been rightly understood by Saya _n_\na and Govinda, who both say that it contains a reproach, addressed to those\nBrahma _n_ as who, contented with the letter of the Veda, do not master its\nmeaning.\n\n[261:33](sbe1465.htm#fr_1258)-34. The commentary omits these two Sutras,\nwhich, however, seem necessary for the completion of the discussion. The p.\n262 second occurs also \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 24, 8. Though Baudhayana does not\nexpress himself as clearly as \xc3\x82pastamba, he disapproves, as it would seem,\nlike the latter, of the opinion of those who gave an undue preference to\nasceticism at the expense of married life, the order of the householders.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Adhyaya 7, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 12](sbe1466.htm)\n\n"
