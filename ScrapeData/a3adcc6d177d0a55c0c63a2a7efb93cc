(As the soul is affected by pleasure and pain) not so the highest (Lord);\nas in the case of light and so on.\n\nWe maintain that the highest Lord does not feel the pain of the sa _m_ sara-\nstate in the same way as the soul does. The soul being engrossed by Nescience\nidentifies itself as it were\n\np. 64\n\nwith the body and so on, and imagines itself to be affected by the experience\nof pain which is due to Nescience, 'I am afflicted by the pain due to the\nbody;' the highest Lord, on the other hand, neither identifies himself with a\nbody, nor imagines himself to be afflicted by pain. The pain of the individual\nsoul also is not real, but imaginary only, caused by the error consisting in\nthe non-discrimination of (the Self from) the body, senses, and other limiting\nadjuncts which are due to name and form, the effects of Nescience. And as a\nperson feels the pain of a burn or cut which affects his body by erroneously\nidentifying himself with the latter, so he feels also the pain affecting\nothers, such as sons or friends, by erroneously identifying himself with them,\nentering as it were into them through love, and imagining 'I am the son, I am\nthe friend.' Wherefrom we infer with certainty that the feeling of pain is due\nmerely to the error of false imagination. At the same conclusion we arrive on\nthe ground of negative instances. Let us consider the case of many men, each\nof whom possesses sons, friends, &c., sitting together, some of them\nerroneously imagining that they are connected with their sons, friends, &c.,\nwhile others do not. If then somebody calls out 'the son has died,' 'the\nfriend has died,' grief is produced in the minds of those who are under the\nimagination of being connected with sons and friends, but not in the minds of\nreligious mendicants who have freed themselves from that imagination. From\nthis it appears that perfect knowledge is of use even to an ordinary man; of\nhow much greater use then will it be to him (i.e. the Lord) whose nature is\neternal pure intelligence, who sees nothing beside the Self for which there\nare no objects. Hence it follows that perfect knowledge is not purposeless.--\nTo illustrate this view the Sutra introduces a comparison 'like light,' &c.\nJust as the light of the sun or the moon which pervades the entire space\nbecomes straight or bent as it were when the limiting adjuncts with which it\nis in contact, such as a finger, for instance, are straight or bent, but does\nnot really become so; and just as the ether, although imagined to move as it\nwere when jars are being moved, does not really move; and as the sun does not\ntremble,\n\np. 65\n\nalthough its image trembles when you shake the cup filled with water in which\nthe sun's light is reflected; thus the Lord also is not affected by pain,\nalthough pain be felt by that part of him which is called the individual soul,\nis presented by Nescience, and limited by the buddhi and other adjuncts. That\nalso the soul's undergoing pain is due to Nescience only, we have already\nexplained. Accordingly the Vedanta--texts teach that, when the soul's\nindividual state, due to Nescience, is sublated, it becomes Brahman, 'Thou art\nthat &c.'--Thus there is no occasion to conclude that the highest Self is\naffected by the pain of the individual soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 47](sbe38048.htm)\n\n"
