Vyasa said :-- O King! Settling in his mind what to do, the great ascetic\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra collected all the materials necessary for the sacrifice and\ninvited all the Munis. Thus invited by Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, the Munis became informed\nall about the Sacrifice; but, owing to the\n\n\n\np. 640\n\n\n\nfact that the Muni Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha prevented them, none of them went to the\nsacrifice. When Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, the son of Gadhi, came to know this, he became\nvery anxious and very sad and came to the King Tris\xc2\x92anku and sat. The Mahar\n_si_ Kaus\xc2\x92ika then became angry and said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha preventing\nthe Brahmi _n_ s have all refused to come to the sacrifice. But, O King! See\nmy power of tapasya; I will immediately fulfil your desires; I will instantly\nsend you to the Heavens, the abode of the Gods.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, that Muni took\nwater in his hand and repeated the Gayatri Mantram. He gave to the King all\nthe Pu _n_ yams (merits) that he collected for himself up to then. Giving him\nthus all the Pu _n_ yams, he spoke to the King :-- \xc2\x93O King! Throw away all\nidleness and go to the abode of the Gods you wanted to go. O King of Kings!\nGladly go to the Heavens by the power of all the merits collected by me for a\nlong time and let you fare well there.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9-20. Vyasa spoke :-- O King! When the King of the Vipras, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, spoke\nthus, the King Tris\xc2\x92anku, by virtue of the Muni\xc2\x92s Tapas, got high up in the\nair without any delay like a quick flying bird. Thus getting up and up, when\nthe King reached the abode of Indra, the Devas, seeing the terrible Cha _nd_\nala-like appearance of Tris\xc2\x92anku, spoke out to Indra :-- \xc2\x93Who is this person\ncoming like a Deva with a violent speed in the air? Why does he look like a\nCha _nd_ ala and is so fierce-looking?\xc2\x94 Hearing thus, Indra got up at once and\nsaw that one, the meanest of the human beings and knowing him to be Tris\xc2\x92anku,\nreproachingly said to him :-- You are a Cha _nd_ ala, quite unfit for the\nDevaloka; so where are you going? You ought not to remain here; so go\nimmediately back to the earth. O Destroyer of the enemies! Indra speaking\nthus, the King dropped from the Heavens and, like a Deva whose merits had been\nexhausted, fell down immediately. Tris\xc2\x92anku then cried out frequently \xc2\x93O\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra! O Vis\xc2\x92vamitra! Being displaced from the Heavens I am now falling\nvery violently; so save me from this trouble.\xc2\x94 O King! Hearing his cry and\nseeing him getting down, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93Wait, wait.\xc2\x94 Though displaced\nfrom Heaven, the King by virtue of the Muni\xc2\x92s Tapas, remained stationed at\nthat place in the middle of the air. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra then began to do \xc3\x82chaman (sip\nwater) and commenced his great Sacrifice to create another new creation and a\nsecond Svargaloka (Heaven). Seeing his resolve, the Lord of S\xc2\x92achi became very\nanxious and eagerly came to the son of Gadhi without the least delay and said\n:-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ a! What are you going to do? O Saint! Why are you so very\nangry? O Muni!\n\n\n\np. 641\n\n\n\nThere is no necessity to create another new creation. Order now what I am to\ndo.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n21\\. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of the Devas! The King Tris\xc2\x92anku has become\nvery miserable to have a fall from the Heavens. Therefore this is now my\nintention that you gladly take him to your own abode.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22-31. Vyasa said :-- O King! Indra was thoroughly aware of his determined\nresolve and very powerful asceticism; so he accepted to do according to his\nword, out of terror. The Lord Indra then gave the King a bright and divine\nbody and made him take his seat in an excellent car and taking leave of\nKaus\xc2\x92ika went with the King to his own abode. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra became glad to see\nTris\xc2\x92anku go to the Heavens with Indra and remained happy in his own \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama.\nThe King Haris\xc2\x92chandra now hearing that his father has gone to Heaven by\nvirtue of his Tapas, began to govern his kingdom with a gladdened heart. The\nKing of Ayodhya began then to live constantly with his clever wife full of\nyouth and beauty. Thus time passed away; but the beautiful wife did not become\npregnant. The King became very sorry and thoughtful. He then went to the holy\nhermitage of Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha and bowing down informed him of his mental agony\ndue to his getting no son. O Knower of Dharma! You are skilled in the Science\nof Mantrams. Especially you know everything of Daiva (Fate). So, O Giver of\nhonour! Do for me so that I get a son. O Best of Brahmi _n_ s! There is no\nsalvation for one who has not got any son; you are well aware of this. Then\nwhy do you overlook my case when you can remove my sorrow. Even these sparrows\nare blessed who nourish their offsprings. And I am so very unfortunate that,\nday and night, I am immersed in cares and anxieties, due to my not having any\nson.\n\n\n\n32\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing these pitiful utterances of the King,\nVas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha thought over in his mind and spoke to him everything in\nparticular.\n\n\n\n33-41. Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha said :-- \xc2\x93O King! True you have spoken that in this world\nthere is no other sorrow more painsgiving than the state of not having any\nissue. Therefore, O King! you worship with great care the water-god Varu _n_\na. He will crown your efforts with success. There is no other god than Varu\n_n_ a to grant sons. So, O Virtuous One! Worship Him and you will get success.\nBoth Fate and Self-exertion are to be respected by men; how can success come\nunless efforts are made. O King! Men who realise the Highest Truth should make\nefforts, guided by just rules; success comes to those who work; else never one\nis to\n\n\n\np. 642\n\n\n\nexpect success.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of the Guru, of unbounded energy, the\nKing made a fixed resolve and bowing himself down, went away to practise\ntapasya. On the banks of the Ganges, in a sacred place, seated on Padmasan,\nthe King became merged in the meditation of the God Varu _n_ a with noose in\nhis hand and thus practised severe asceticism. O King! When he was doing this,\nthe god Varu _n_ a took pity on him and gladly came before his sight. Varu _n_\na, then, spoke to the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra :-- \xc2\x93O Knower of Dharma! I am glad at\nyour tapasya. So ask boons from me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n42-43. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O God! I am without any son; give me a son, who will\ngive me happiness and will free me from the three debts that I owe to the\nDevas, the Pitris and the Ri _s_ is. Know that with that object I am doing\nthis Tapasya.\xc2\x94 Then the God Varu _n_ a, hearing these humble words of the\nsorrowful King, smiled and said.\n\n\n\n44-45. O King! If you get your desired well-qualified son, what will you do\nfor me to my satisfaction? O King! If you perform a sacrifice in honour of me\nand fearlessly sacrifice your son there like an animal, I will then grant you\nyour desired boon.\n\n\n\n46-47. The King :-- \xc2\x93O Deva! Free me from this state of sonless-ness; O Water\nGod! When my son will be born, I will do your sacrifice with my son as an\nanimal in that. This I speak truly to you. O Giver of honour! There is no\nsuffering more unbearable than this one, not to have any son; so grant me a\ngood son so that all my sorrows be vanished.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n48\\. Varu _n_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O King! You will get a son as you desire; go home;\nbut see what you have spoken before be fulfilled and turned true.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n49-55. Vyasa said :-- Hearing these words from Varu _n_ a, Haris\xc2\x92chandra went\nback and told everything about his getting the boon to his wife. The King had\none hundred exquisitely beautiful wives of whom, S\xc2\x92aivya was the lawful wife\nand queen and was very chaste. After some time, that wife became pregnant and\nthe King became very glad to hear this and her longings in that state. The\nKing performed all her purificatory ceremonies, and when ten months were\ncompleted, and on an auspicious Nak _s_ atra and on an auspicious day, she\ngave birth to a son, like that of a Deva son. On the birth of his son, the\nKing, surrounded by the Brahmi _n_ s, performed his ablutions and first of all\nperformed the natal ceremonies and distributed innumerable jewels and much\n\n\n\np. 643\n\n\n\nwealth; and the King\xc2\x92s joy knew no bounds at that time. The liberal King gave\naway, in special charities, wealth, grains, and various jewels and lands and\nhad the performance of music, dancing and other things.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourteenth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the going to Heavens\nof Tris\xc2\x92anku and the commencement of Haris\xc2\x92chandra\xc2\x92s narrative in the Maha\nPura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 15](bk07ch15.htm)\n\n'
