Pra _g_ apati was becoming heated (by fervid devotion), whilst\ncreating living beings 1. From him, worn out and heated, _S_ ri (Fortune and\nBeauty) came forth. She stood there resplendent, shining, and trembling 2. The\ngods, beholding her thus resplendent, shining, and trembling, set their minds\nupon her.\n\n11:4:3:22\\. They said to Pra _g_ apati, 'Let us kill her and take (all) this\nfrom her.' He said, 'Surely, that _S_ ri is a woman, and people do not kill a\nwoman, but rather take (anything) from her (leaving her) alive.'\n\n11:4:3:33\\. Agni then took her food, Soma her royal power, Varu _n_ a her\nuniversal _s_ overeignty, Mitra her noble rank, Indra her power, B _ri_\nhaspati her holy lustre, Savit _ri_ her dominion, Pushan her wealth, Sarasvati\nher prosperity, and Tvash _t_ _ri_ her beautiful forms.\n\n11:4:3:44\\. She said to Pra _g_ apati, 'Surely, they have taken (all) this\nfrom me!' He said, 'Do thou ask it back from them by sacrifice!'\n\np. 63\n\n11:4:3:55\\. She perceived this offering with ten sacrificial dishes--a cake on\neight potsherds for Agni, a pap for Soma, a cake on ten potsherds for Varu _n_\na, a pap for Mitra, a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra, a pap for B _ri_\nhaspati, a cake on twelve or eight potsherds for Savit _ri_ , a pap for\nPushan, a pap for Sarasvati, and a cake on ten potsherds for Tvash _t_ _ri_.\n\n11:4:3:66\\. She invited them by means of this invitatory formula,--'May Agni,\nSoma, Varu _n_ a, Mitra, Indra, B _ri_ haspati, and the thousandfold-bestowing\nSavit _ri_ ,--May Pushan, for our Sacrifices, unite us with cattle, Sarasvati\nwith favour, Tvash _t_ _ri_ with beautiful forms!' They accordingly made their\nappearance again.\n\n11:4:3:77\\. By this offering-formula she then approached them in inverted\norder (beginning) from the last:--'May Tvash _t_ _ri_ grant me forms, and the\nbountiful Sarasvati, and Pushan good fortune, and may Savit _ri_ bestow gifts\non me, and Indra power, and Mitra noble rank, and Varu _n_ a, and Soma and\nAgni!' They were ready to restore them to her.\n\n11:4:3:88\\. She perceived these additional oblations:--'May Agni, the food-\neater, the food-lord, bestow food upon me at this sacrifice, svaha!' Agni,\ntaking the oblation, departed and restored her food to her.\n\n11:4:3:99\\. 'May Soma, the king, the lord of kings, bestow royal power upon me\nat this sacrifice, svaha!' Soma, taking the oblation, departed and restored\nher royal power to her.\n\n11:4:3:1010\\. 'May Varu _n_ a, the universal sovereign, the lord of universal\nsovereigns, bestow universal sovereignty upon me at this sacrifice,\n\np. 64\n\nsvaha!' Varu _n_ a, taking the oblation, departed and restored her universal\nsovereignty to her.\n\n11:4:3:1111\\. 'May Mitra, the Kshatra (nobility), the lord of the Kshatra,\nbestow noble rank upon me at this sacrifice, svaha!' Mitra, taking the\noblation, departed and restored her noble rank to her.\n\n11:4:3:1212\\. 'May Indra, the power, the lord of power, bestow power upon me\nat this sacrifice, svaha!' Indra, taking the oblation, departed and restored\nher power to her.\n\n11:4:3:1313\\. 'May B _ri_ haspati, the Brahman (priesthood), the lord of the\nBrahman, bestow holy lustre upon me at this sacrifice, svaha!' B _ri_ haspati,\ntaking the oblation, departed and restored her holy lustre to her.\n\n11:4:3:1414\\. 'May Savit _ri_ , the kingdom, the lord of the kingdom, bestow\nthe kingdom upon me at this sacrifice, svaha!' Savit _ri_ , taking the\noblation, departed and restored her kingdom to her.\n\n11:4:3:1515\\. 'May Pushan, wealth, the lord of wealth, bestow wealth upon me\nat this sacrifice, svaha!' Pushan, taking the oblation, departed and restored\nher wealth to her.\n\n11:4:3:1616\\. 'May Sarasvati, prosperity 1, the lord of prosperity, bestow\nprosperity upon me at this sacrifice, svaha!' Sarasvati, taking the oblation,\ndeparted and restored her prosperity to her.\n\n11:4:3:1717\\. 'May Tvash _t_ _ri_ , the fashioner of forms,\n\np. 65\n\nthe lord of forms, bestow cattle with form 1 upon me at this sacrifice,\nsvaha!' Tvash _t_ _ri_ , taking the oblation, departed and restored her cattle\nwith (beautiful) form to her.\n\n11:4:3:1818\\. These, then, are ten deities, ten sacrificial dishes, . ten\nofferings, ten presents to priests,--the Vira _g_ consists of decad after\ndecad (of syllables), and the Vira _g_ (shining one) is _S_ ri (beauty,\nprosperity): he thus establishes (the Sacrificer) in the Vira _g_ , in\nprosperity and food.\n\n11:4:3:1919\\. For this (sacrifice) there are fifteen kindling-verses 2: he\noffers to the deities in a low voice 3. There are five fore-offerings, three\nafter-offerings, and one Samish _t_ aya _g_ us. The (formulas of the) two\nbutter-portions contain the word 'affluence':--( _Ri_ g-veda S. I, 1, 3),\n'Through Agni may he obtain wealth and affluence day by day, famous and\nabounding in heroes;'--( _Ri_ g-veda S. I, 91, 12), 'An increaser of the\nhouse, a remover of trouble, a procurer of wealth, an augmenter of affluence,\na kind friend he thou unto us, O Soma!' The two formulas of the Svish _t_ ak\n_ri_ t contain the word 'thousand':--( _Ri_ g-veda S. III, 13, 7), 'Grant thou\nunto us wealth, a thousandfold, with offspring and affluence, and glorious\nmanhood, O Agni, most excellent and never\n\np. 66\n\nfailing!'--( _Ri_ g-veda S. III, 13, 6), 'Favour thou our prayer, as the best\ninvoker of the gods for our hymns: blaze up auspiciously for us, wind-fanned,\nO Agni, the dispenser of a thousand bounties!'\n\n11:4:3:2020\\. Now, indeed, it was Gotama Rahuga _n_ a who discovered this\n(sacrifice). It went away to _G_ anaka of Videha, and he searched for it in\nthe Brahma _n_ as versed in the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas 1 (limbs of the Veda), and found it in\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya. He said, 'A thousand we give thee, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,\nin whom we have found that Mitravinda.' He finds (vind) Mitra, and his is the\nkingdom, he conquers recurring death 2 and gains all life, whosoever, knowing\nthis, performs this sacrifice; or whosoever thus knows it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[62:1](sbe44023.htm#fr_216) That is, gods, men, &c., Say.\n\n[62:2](sbe44023.htm#fr_217) Saya _n_ a apparently takes 'lelayanti' in the\nsense of 'all-embracing' (from liyate, to nestle against),--dipyamana avayavai\n_h_ _s_ obhamana bhra _g_ amana sarva _m_ _g_ agat svate _g_ asa praka _s_\nayanti svakiyena te _g_ a _h_ pu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ena sarvam a _s_ lishyanti atish _th_\nat sthitavati.\n\n[64:1](sbe44023.htm#fr_218) I read 'push _t_ i _h_ ' instead of 'push _t_ im.'\nSaya _n_ a takes it thus,--whatever prosperity Sarasvati, the lord of\nprosperity, took from me, may he bestow that prosperity upon me!\n\n[65:1](sbe44023.htm#fr_219) Saya _n_ a supplies 'vi _s_ ish _t_ an,'--cattle\nendowed with form.\n\n[65:2](sbe44023.htm#fr_220) That is, the ordinary number of samidhenis at an\nish _t_ i, viz. eleven verses, the first and last of which are recited three\ntimes each.
