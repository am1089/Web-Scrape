But in either case (such men) stand outside; on account of Sm _ri_ ti and\ncustom.\n\nWhether the point under discussion constitutes a minor or a major offence, in\nany case those who have lapsed stand outside the category of those qualified\nfor the knowledge of Brahman. For Sm _ri_ ti, i.e. the text quoted above, 'I\nsee no expiatory performance by which he, a slayer of Brahman as he is, could\nbecome pure again,' declares that expiations are powerless to restore purity.\nAnd custom confirms the same conclusion; for good men shun those Naish _th_\nikas who have lapsed, even after they have performed prayas _k_ ittas, and do\nnot impart to them the knowledge of Brahman, The conclusion, therefore, is\nthat such men are not qualified for knowing Brahman.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'him who has become that.'\n\n44\\. By the Lord (of the sacrifice), since Scripture declares a fruit--thus\n\xc3\x82treya thinks.\n\nA doubt arises whether the meditations on such constituent elements of the\nsacrifice as the Udgitha, and so on, are to be performed by the sacrificer\n(for whose benefit the sacrifice is offered), or by the officiating priests.\n\xc3\x82treya advocates the former view; on the ground of Scripture showing that in\nthe case of such meditations as the one on the small ether within the heart,\nfruit and meditation belong to the same person, and that in the case of such\nmeditations as the one on the Udgitha the fruit belongs to the sacrificer\n(whence we conclude that the meditation also is his). Nor can it be said that\nthe sacrificer is not competent for such meditation, for the reason that like\nthe godohana vessel it is connected with an element of the sacrifice (which\nlatter the priests only can perform). For the godohana vessel serves to bring\nwater, and this of course none else can do but the Adhvaryu; while a\nmeditation on the Udgitha as being the essence of all essences can very well\nbe performed by the Sacrificer--true though\n\np. 708\n\nit be that the Udgitha itself can be performed by the Udgat _ri_ priest only.\n--Against this view the next Sutra declares itself.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 45.
