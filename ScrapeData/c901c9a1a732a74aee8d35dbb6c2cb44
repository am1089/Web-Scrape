XX.\n\nVishn\xcc\x81u appears to Prahlada. Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu relents, and is reconciled to his\nson: he is put to death by Vishn\xcc\x81u as the Nrisinha. Prahlada becomes king of\nthe Daityas: his posterity: fruit of hearing his story.\n\nTHUS meditating upon Vishn\xcc\x81u, as identical with his own spirit, Prahlada\nbecame as one with him, and finally regarded himself as the divinity: he\nforgot entirely his own individuality, and was conscious of nothing else than\nhis being the inexhaustible, eternal, supreme soul; and in consequence of the\nefficacy of this conviction of identity, the imperishable Vishn\xcc\x81u, whose\nessence is wisdom, became present in his heart, which was wholly purified from\nsin. As soon as, through the force of his contemplation, Prahlada had become\none with Vishn\xcc\x81u, the bonds with which he was bound burst instantly asunder;\nthe ocean was violently uplifted; and the monsters of the deep were alarmed;\nearth with all her forests and mountains trembled; and the prince, putting\naside the rocks which the demons had piled Upon him, came forth from out the\nmain. When he beheld the outer world again, and contemplated earth and heaven,\nhe remembered who he was, and recognised himself to be Prahlada; and again he\nhymned Purushottama, who is without beginning or end; his mind being steadily\nand undeviatingly addressed to the object of his prayers, and his speech,\nthoughts, and acts being firmly under control. "Om! glory to the end of all:\nto thee, lord, who art subtile and substantial; mutable and immutable;\nperceptible and imperceptible; divisible and indivisible; indefinable and\ndefinable; the subject of attributes, and void of attributes; abiding in\nqualities, though they abide not in thee; morphous and amorphous; minute and\nvast; visible and invisible; hideousness and beauty; ignorance and wisdom;\ncause and effect; existence and non-existence; comprehending all that is good\nand evil; essence of perishable and imperishable elements; asylum of\nundeveloped rudiments. Oh thou who art both one and many, Vasudeva, first\ncause of all; glory be unto thee. Oh thou who art large and small, manifest\nand hidden; who art all beings, and art not\n\np. 144\n\nall beings; and from whom, although distinct from universal cause, the\nuniverse proceeds: to thee, Purushottama, be all glory."\n\nWhilst with mind intent on Vishn\xcc\x81u, he thus pronounced his praises, the\ndivinity, clad in yellow robes, suddenly appeared before him. Startled at the\nsight, with hesitating speech Prahlada pronounced repeated salutations to\nVishn\xcc\x81u, and said, "Oh thou who removest all worldly grief, Ke\xc5\x9bava, be\npropitious unto me; again sanctify me, Achyuta, by thy sight." The deity\nreplied, "I am pleased with the faithful attachment thou hast shown to me:\ndemand from me, Prahlada, whatever thou desirest." Prahlada replied, "In all\nthe thousand births through which I may be doomed to pass, may my faith in\nthee, Achyuta, never know decay; may passion, as fixed as that which the\nworldly-minded feel for sensual pleasures, ever animate my heart, always\ndevoted unto thee." Bhagavan answered, "Thou hast already devotion unto me,\nand ever shalt have it: now choose some boon, whatever is in thy wish."\nPrahlada then said, "I have been hated, for that I assiduously proclaimed thy\npraise: do thou, oh lord, pardon in my father this sin that he Bath committed.\nWeapons have been hurled against me; I have been thrown into the flames; I\nhave been bitten by venomous snakes; and poison has been mixed with my food; I\nhave been bound and cast into the sea; and heavy rocks have been heaped upon\nme: but all this, and whatever ill beside has been wrought against me;\nwhatever wickedness has been done to me, because I put my faith in thee; all,\nthrough thy mercy, has been suffered by me unharmed: and do thou therefore\nfree my father from this iniquity." To this application Vishn\xcc\x81u replied, "All\nthis shall be unto thee, through my favour: but I give thee another boon:\ndemand it, son of the Asura." Prahlada answered and said, "All my desires, oh\nlord, have been fulfilled by the boon that thou hast granted, that my faith in\nthee shall never know decay. Wealth, virtue, love, are as nothing; for even\nliberation is in his reach whose faith is firm in thee, root of the universal\nworld." Vishn\xcc\x81u said, "Since thy heart is filled immovably with trust in me,\nthou shalt, through my blessing, attain freedom from existence." Thus saying,\nVishn\xcc\x81u vanished from his sight; and Prahlada repaired to his father, and\nbowed down before him. His father\n\np. 145\n\nkissed him on the forehead 1, and embraced him, and shed tears, and said,\n"Dost thou live, my son?" And the great Asura repented of his former cruelty,\nand treated him with kindness: and Prahlada, fulfilling his duties like any\nother youth, continued diligent in the service of his preceptor and his\nfather. After his father had been put to death by Vishn\xcc\x81u in the form of the\nman-lion 2, Prahlada became the sovereign of the Daityas; and possessing the\nsplendours of royalty consequent upon his piety, exercised extensive sway, and\nwas blessed with a numerous progeny. At the expiration of an authority which\nwas the reward of his meritorious acts, he was freed from the consequences of\nmoral merit or demerit, and obtained, through meditation on the deity, final\nexemption from existence.\n\nSuch, Maitreya, was the Daitya Prahlada, the wise and faithful worshipper of\nVishn\xcc\x81u, of whom you wished to hear; and such was his miraculous power.\nWhoever listens to the history of Prahlada is immediately cleansed from his\nsins: the iniquities that he commits, by night or by day, shall be expiated by\nonce hearing, or once reading, the history of Prahlada. The perusal of this\nhistory on the day of full moon, of new moon, or on the eighth or twelfth day\nof the lunation 3,\n\np. 146\n\nshall yield fruit equal to the donation of a cow 4. As Vishn\xcc\x81u protected\nPrahlada in all the calamities to which he was exposed, so shall the deity\nprotect him who listens constantly to the tale 5.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[145:1](vp055.htm#fr_324) Literally, \'having smelt his forehead.\' I have\nelsewhere had occasion to observe this practice: Hindu Theatre, II. 45.\n\n[145:2](vp055.htm#fr_325) Here is another instance of that brief reference to\npopular and prior legends, which is frequent in this Puran\xcc\x81a. The man-lion\nAvatara is referred to in several of the Puran\xcc\x81as, but I have met with the\nstory in detail only in the Bhagavata. It is there said that Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu\nasks his son, why, if Vishn\xcc\x81u is every where, he is not visible in a pillar in\nthe hall, where they are assembled. He then rises, and strikes the column with\nhis fist; on which Vishn\xcc\x81u, in a form which is neither wholly a lion nor a\nman, issues from it, and a conflict ensues, which ends in Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu\'s\nbeing torn to pieces. Even this account, therefore, is not in all particulars\nthe same as the popular version of the story.\n\n[145:3](vp055.htm#fr_326) The days of full and new moon are sacred with all\nsects of Hindus: the eighth and twelfth days of the lunar half month were\nconsidered holy by the Vaishn\xcc\x81avas, as appears from the text. The eighth\nmaintains its character in a great degree from the eighth of Bhadra being the\nbirthday of Krishn\xcc\x81a; but the eleventh, in more recent Vaishn\xcc\x81ava works, as\nthe Brahma Vaivartta P., has taken the place of the twelfth, and is even more\nsacred than the eighth.\n\n[146:4](vp055.htm#fr_327) Or any solemn gift; that of a cow is held\nparticularly sacred; but it implies accompaniments of a more costly character,\nornaments and gold.\n\n[146:5](vp055.htm#fr_328) The legend of Prahlada is inserted in detail in the\nBhagavata and Naradiya Puran\xcc\x81as, and in the Uttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Padma: it\nis adverted to more briefly in the Vayu, Linga, Kurma, &c., in the Moksha\nDharma of the Mahabharata, and in the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXI](vp056.htm)\n\n'
