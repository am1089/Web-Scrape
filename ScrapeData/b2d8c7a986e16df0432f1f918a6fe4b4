Narada said :-- O Bhagavan! How came the pure chaste Tulasi to be the\nwife of Naraya _n_ a? Where was Her birth place? And what was She in Her\nprevious birth? What family did She belong to? Whose daughter was She? And\nwhat austerities did She practise, that She got\n\n\n\np. 864\n\n\n\nNaraya _n_ a for Her husband, Who is above Prak _r_ iti, not liable to change\nwithout any effort, the Universal Self, Para Brahma and the Highest God; Who\nis the Lord of all, omniscient, the Cause of all, the Receptacle of all,\nOmnipresent, and the Preserver of all. And how did Tulasi, the chief Devi of\nNaraya _n_ a, turn out into a tree? Herself quite innocent, how She was\nattacked by the fierce Asura? O Remover of all doubts! My mind, plain and\nsimple, has become restless. I am eager to hear all this. So kindly cut\nasunder all my doubts.\n\n\n\n7-40. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! The Manu Dak _s_ a Savar _n_ i was very\nreligious, devoted to Vi _sn_ u, of wide renown, of a great name, and born\nwith Vi _sn_ u's parts. Dak _s_ a Savar _n_ i\xc2\x92s son Brahma Savar _n_ i was\nalso very religious, devoted to Vi _sn_ u and of a pure S'uddha Sattva Gu _n_\na. Brahma Savar _n_ i's son, Dharma Savar _n_ i was devoted to Vi _sn_ u and\nHe was the master of his senses. Dharma Savar _n_ i's sons Rudra Savar _n_ i\nwas also a man of restraint and very devoted. Rudra Savar _n_ i's son was Deva\nSavar _n_ i, devoted to Vi _sn_ u. Deva Savar _n_ i's son was Indra Savar _n_\ni. He was a great Bhakta of Vi _sn_ u. His son was Vri _s_ adhvaja. But He was\na fanatic S'aiva (devoted to S'iva). At his house S'iva Himself remained for\nthree Yugas according to the Deva measure. So much so that Bhagavan Bhutanatha\nloved him more than His own son. Vri _s_ adhvaja did not recognise Naraya _n_\na, nor Lak _s_ mi nor Sarasvati nor another body. He discarded the worship of\nall the Devas. He worshipped S'ankara only. The greatly exciting Lak _s_ mi\nPuja (worship of Maha Lak _s_ mi) in the month of Bhadra and S\xc2\x92ri Pa\xc3\xb1chami\nPuja in the month of Magha, which are approved of by the Vedas, Vri _s_\nadhvaja put an entire stop to these and the Sarasvati Puja. At this the Sun\nbecame angry with the King Vri _s_ adhvaja, the discarder of the holy thread,\nthe hater of Vi _sn_ u, and cursed Him thus :-- \xc2\x93O King! As you are purely\ndevoted to S\xc2\x92iva and S\xc2\x92iva alone, and as you do not recognise any other Devas,\nI say within no time, you will be deprived of all your wealth and prosperity.\xc2\x94\nS'ankara, hearing this curse, became very angry and taking His trident, ran\nafter the Sun. The Sun, becoming afraid, accompanied His father Kas'yapa and\ntook refuge of Brahma. Bhagavan S'ankara went to the Brahma Loka, with trident\nin His hands. Brahma became afraid of Mahadeva and took Sun to the region of\nVaiku _nt_ ha. Out of terror, the throats of Brahma, Kas'yapa, and Sun became\nparched and dry and they all went afraid for refuge to Naraya _n_ a, the Lord\nof all. They all bowed down to Him and praised Him frequently and finally\ninformed Him of the cause of their coming and why they were so much afraid.\nNaraya _n_ a showed them mercy and granted them \xc2\x93Abhaya\xc2\x94 (no fear). O You! Who\nare afraid, take rest. What cause of fear there can be to you, when I am here!\n\n\n\np. 865\n\n\n\nWhoever remembers Me, wherever he may be, involved in danger or fear, I go\nthere with the Sudars'an disc in My hand and save him. O Devas! I am always\nthe Creator, Preserver and Destroyer of this universe. In the form of Vi _sn_\nu, I am the Preserver; in the form of Brahma, I am the Creator; and in the\nform of Mahes'a, I am the Destroyer. I am S\xc2\x92iva; I am you; and I am the Surya,\ncomposed of the three qualities. It is I who assumes many forms and preserves\nthe universe. Better go to your respective places. What fear can ye suspect? I\nsay, all your fears due to S'ankara, are verily removed from this day.\nBhagavan S'ankara, the Lord of all, is the Lord of the Sadhus. He always hears\nthe words of His Bhaktas; and He is kind to them. He is their Self. Both the\nSun and S\xc2\x92iva are dearer to Me than My life. No one is more energetic than\nS'ankara and the Sun. Mahadeva can easily create ten million Suns and ten\nmillion Brahmas. There is nothing impossible with S'ulapani. Having no\nconsciousness of any outer thing, immersed, day and night, in meditating on Me\nwith His whole heart concentrated, He is repeating with devotion My Mantra\nfrom His five faces and He always sings My glories. I am also thinking, day\nand night, of His welfare. Whoever worships Me in whichever way, I also favour\nhim similarly. Bhagavan Maha Deva is of the nature of S\xc2\x92iva, all\nauspiciousness; He is the presiding deity of S'iva, that is, liberation. It is\nbecause liberation is obtained from Him, He is called S\xc2\x92iva. O dear Narada!\nWhile Naraya _n_ a was thus speaking, the trident bolder Mahadeva, with his\neyes red like reddened lotuses, mounting on His bull, came up there and\ngetting down from His Bull, humbly bowed down with devotion to the Lord of Lak\n_s_ mi, peaceful and higher than the highest. Naraya _n_ a was then seated on\nHis throne, decked with jewel ornaments. There was a crown on His crest; two\nearrings were hanging from His ears; the disc was in His hand, forest flower's\ngarlands on His neck; of the colour of fresh blue rain cloud; His form\nexceedingly beautiful. The four-armed attendants were fanning Him with their\nfour hands; His body smeared all over with sandal-paste and He is wearing the\nyellow garment. That Bhagavan, distressed with the thought of welfare for His\nBhaktas, the Highest Self was sitting on a jewel throne and chewing the betel\noffered by Padma and with smiling countenance, seeing and hearing the dancing\nand singing of the Vidyadharis. When Mahadeva bowed down to Naraya _n_ a,\nBrahma also bowed down to Mahadeva. The Sun, too, surprised, bowed down to\nMahadeva with devotion. Kas'yapa, too, bowed and with great bhakti, began to\npraise Mahadeva. On the other hand, S\xc2\x92ankara praised Naraya _n_ a and took His\nseat on\n\n\n\np. 866\n\n\n\nthe throne. The attendants of Naraya _n_ a began to fan Mahadeva with white\nchowries. Then Vi _sn_ u addressed Him with sweet nectar like voice and said\n:-- \xc2\x93O Mahes'vara! What brings Thee here? Hast Thou been angry?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n41-45. Mahadeva said : -- \xc2\x93O Vi _sn_ u! The King Vri _s_ adhavaja is My great\ndevotee; he is dearer to Me than My life. The Sun has cursed him and so I am\nangry. Out of the affection for a son I am ready to kill Surya. Surya took\nBrahma's refuge and now he and Brahma have taken Thy refuge. And Those who\nbeing distressed take Thy refuge, either in mind or in word, become entirely\nsafe and free from danger. They conquer death and old age. What to speak of\nthem, then, of those who come personally to Thee and take Thy refuge. The\nremembrance of Hari takes away all dangers. All good comes to them. O Lord of\nthe world! Now tell me what becomes of My stupid Bhakta who has become devoid\nof fortune and prosperity by the curse of Surya.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n46-51. Vi _sn_ u said :-- \xc2\x93O S'ankara! Twenty-one yugas elapsed within this\none-half Gha _t_ ika, by the coincidence of Fate (Daiva). Now go quickly to\nThy abode. Through the unavoidable coincidence of the cruel Fate, Vri _s_\nadhvaja died. His son Rathadhvaja, too, died. Rathadhvaja had two noble sons\nDharmadhvaja and Kus'adhvaja. Both of them are great Vai _sn_ avas; but,\nthrough Surya's curse, they have become luckless. Their kingdoms are lost;\nthey have become destitute of all property, prosperity and they are now\nengaged in worshipping Maha Lak _s_ mi. Maha Lak _s_ mi will be born in parts\nof their two wives. Then again, by the grace of Lak _s_ mi, Dharmadhvaja and\nKus'adhvaja will be prosperous and become great Kings. O S'ambhu Your\nworshipper Vri _s_ adhvaja is dead. Therefore Thou dost go back to Thy place.\nO Brahma, O Sun! O Kas'yapa! You all also better go to your places\nrespectively.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Thus saying, Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u went with His wife to\nthe inner rooms. The Devas also went gladly to their own places respectively.\nAnd Mahadeva, too, Who is always quite full within Himself, departed quickly\nto perform His Tapas.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifteenth Chapter on the question of anecdote of Tulasi in the\nNinth Book in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 16](bk09ch16.htm)\n\n"
