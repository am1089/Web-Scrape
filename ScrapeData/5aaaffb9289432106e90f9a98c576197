Upako _s_ ala Kamalayana dwelt as a Brahma _k_ arin (religious student) in\nthe house of Satyakama _G_ abala. He tended his fires for twelve years. But\nthe teacher, though he allowed other pupils (after they had learnt the sacred\nbooks) to depart to their own homes, did not allow Upakosala to depart.\n\n2\\. Then his wife said to him: 'This student, who is quite exhausted (with\nausterities), has carefully tended your fires. Let not the fires themselves\nblame you, but teach him.' The teacher, however, went away on a journey\nwithout having taught him.\n\nThe student from sorrow was not able to eat.\n\np. 65\n\n[paragraph continues] Then the wife of the teacher said to him: 'Student, eat!\nWhy do you not eat?' He said: 'There are many desires in this man here, which\nlose themselves in different directions. I am full of sorrows, and shall take\nno food.'\n\n4\\. Thereupon the fires said among themselves: 'This student, who is quite\nexhausted, has carefully tended us. Well, let us teach him.' They said to him:\n\n5\\. 'Breath is Brahman, Ka (pleasure) is Brahman, Kha (ether) is Brahman.'\n\nHe said: 'I understand that breath is Brahman, but I do not understand Ka or\nKha 1.'\n\nThey said: 'What is Ka is Kha, what is Kha is Ka 2.' They therefore taught him\nBrahman as breath, and as the ether (in the heart) 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[64:3](sbe01087.htm#fr_210) The Upako _s_ ala-vidya teaches first Brahman as\nthe cause, and then in its various forms, and is therefore called atmavidya\nand agnividya.\n\n[65:1](sbe01087.htm#fr_211) I do not understand, he means, how Ka, which means\npleasure, and is non-eternal, and how Kha, which means ether, and is not\nintelligent, can be Brahman.\n\n[65:2](sbe01087.htm#fr_212) The commentator explains as follows:--Ka is\npleasure, and Kha is ether, but these two words are to determine each other\nmutually, and thus to form one idea. Ka therefore does not mean ordinary\npleasures, but pleasures such as belong to Kha, the ether. And Kha does not\nsignify the ordinary outward ether, but the ether in the heart, which alone is\ncapable of pleasure. What is meant by Ka and Kha is therefore the sentient\nether in the heart, and that is Brahman, while Pra _n_ a, breath, is Brahman,\nin so far as it is united with the ether in the heart.\n\n[65:3](sbe01087.htm#fr_213) And as its ether, i.e. as the ether in the heart,\nthe Brahman, with which pra _n_ a is connected.
