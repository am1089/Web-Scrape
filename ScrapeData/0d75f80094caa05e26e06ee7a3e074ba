Vyasa said :-- The King's lovely daughter was very glad on hearing the\nwords of the Brahma _n_ a, and drowned herself in ecstacy of love. The Brahmi\n_n_ also departed, thinking of the whole affair.\n\n\n\n2\\. The daughter was already attached to the prince, and now she became the\nmore merged in love for him and became very anxious. Now, on the departure of\nthe Brahmi _n_ , she felt herself struck by the arrows of love.\n\n\n\n3-4. Then S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala, oppressed by love, addressed her dear companion, who\nfollowed her inclinations thus :-- \xc2\x93O my companion! I have not as yet had any\nknowledge of the king's son; still the signs of love have sprung up in my body\nand mind, from the moment that I heard about him from the Brahmi _n_. The love\nis giving me much trouble; tell, my companion what am I to do now? and whither\nshall I go?\n\n\n\n5\\. O dear companion! I saw him like a second God of Love in my dreams; and,\nsince then, my innocent mind is being troubled with his being away from me.\n\n\n\n6\\. O fair one! The sandal paste on my body appears to me like a poison, this\ngarland is like a serpent and the moon's rays seem like a fire.\n\n\n\n7\\. O companion! My mind gets not rest anywhere, in palaces, gardens, in\nlakes, in hills, at any time, during the day or night; all the enjoyable\nthings have assumed now contrary aspects and are paining me.\n\n\n\n8\\. The bedding, betel leaves, music, singing, and dancing, all now fail to\ngive me satisfaction and peace.\n\n\n\n9\\. O companion! I would have gone to-day where is residing that deceiver; but\nI fear for my father as well for the honour of my family.\n\n\n\np. 192\n\n\n\n10\\. My father is not yet declaring the svayamvara for my marriage. What shall\nI do? Had he given me in marriage to that Sudars\xc2\x92an, I would have allowed him\nembrace me and satisfy his passions to-day!\n\n\n\n11\\. O friend! look at the strange ideas of the Creator! There are hundreds of\nkings today who are influential and I do not consider them beautiful; and that\nKing's son is exiled from his kingdom and yet he has stolen away my heart.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n12\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus that King's son, Sudars\xc2\x92ana, though helpless, and\nliving in a forest on roots and fruits, deprived of wealth, power, and army,\nbegan to reign in the heart of that princess.\n\n\n\n13-14. S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala, too, began to recite slowly the root mantra of Sarasvati\nand therefore her love towards this prince held out signs of success.\n\n\n\nOnce engaged in meditation on that excellent root mantra on Kama, and, while\nrepeatedly reciting it mentally, he got in a dream the vision of that Ever\nFull, the World Mother Ambika, that cannot be expressed in words, the Vai _sn_\navi S\xc2\x92akti and capable to bestow all wealth and property.\n\n\n\n15-16. At this time the King of Ni _s_ adas, the lord of S\xc2\x92rimgaverpur came to\nthe hermitage and presented an excellent chariot together with all other\nnecessary things. This chariot was drawn by four horses, decorated with nice\nflags and was endowed with the prospect of getting victory everywhere;\nthinking it thus a befitting present to be given to the King, he gave it to\nSudars\xc2\x92ana.\n\n\n\n17\\. Sudars'ana, too, accepted the offer of a friend and worshipped him well\nin return, with roots and fruits of the forest.\n\n\n\n18-19. The lord of the Ni _s_ adas, thus worshipped as a guest, went away. The\nMunis and ascetics then began to address Sudars'ana, with fondness \xc2\x93O son of\nthe king! Don't be anxious and restless; within a very short time, you will\nget your kingdom, no doubt, by your own good luck and prowess.\n\n\n\n20\\. O one attached to one\xc2\x92s vows! The Goddess that enchants the whole\nuniverse, the Giver of boons, S\xc2\x92ri Ambika, has been pleased with you;\nassistance is also rendered well to you; therefore do not trouble yourself\nwith contrary thoughts any more.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n21\\. The Munis, who have taken vows, addressed Manorama also \xc2\x93Your son will\nsoon become the lord of the world; you need not care any more.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22\\. Then the lean and thin Manorama, hearing the Muni's words said \xc2\x93O Brahma\n_n_ as! Let your asiss (words of benedictions) be justified with success. What\nwonder that a kingdom be obtained by the good will of the Sadhus!\n\n\n\np. 193\n\n\n\n23\\. There is no force, no minister, no help, no property; how, under what\ncombinations, can then my son get kingship?\n\n\n\n24\\. You are the best of the knowers of mantrams; due to the influence of your\ngood will, my son will surely be a king; there is no doubt in this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n25\\. Vyasa said :-- Wherever that intelligent Sudars'ana used to go on his\nchariot, there he seemed by his own prowess, as if he were surrounded by a\nwhole army consisting of 109, 350 foot, 65,610 horse, 21,870 chariots and\n21,870 elephants.\n\n\n\n26\\. This is the influence of the seed mantra; it is not an ordinary\nacquisition. It is because Sudars\xc2\x92ana, with gladness and one-pointedness of\nhis mind, meditated on his seed mantra, that he acquired the above powers;\nthere is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n27\\. Becoming pure and peaceful, whoever gets this wonderul seed mantra from a\ntrue spiritual guide and meditates on it incessantly, is destined certainly to\nattain all desires.\n\n\n\n28\\. O best of kings! There is no such thing either in the heavens above or in\nthe worlds below, that a man won\xc2\x92t get, when the Supreme Goddess becomes\npleased.\n\n\n\n29\\. Those are certainly very unfortunate and of dull intellect, who cannot\nplace their faith on the worship of this Goddess and consequently suffer\nincessantly all sorts of troubles.\n\n\n\n30\\. O best of the Kurus! At the beginning of the creation, this Amba Devi was\nthe Mother of all the Gods, and is therefore known as the First Mother.\n\n\n\n31\\. She is practically seen in this world in the shape of Buddhi\n(iutellgence), Kirti (fame), Dhriti (fortitude), Lak _s_ mi (Goddess of\nwealth), S\xc2\x92akti (the Force), S\xc2\x92raddha (Faith), Mati (Intellect), Smriti\n(memory), etc.\n\n\n\n32\\. It is only the deluded souls that do not realise the nature of the Devi;\nit is only those, whose hearts are destroyed by the glare of false argument,\nthat do not worship this All-auspicious Goddess of the Universe.\n\n\n\n33-34. O king! Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, S\xc2\x92ambhu, Indra, Varu _n_ a, Yama, Vayu,\nAgni, Kuvera, Vis'vakarma, Pu _s_ a, Bhaga, the two Asvins, \xc3\x82dityas, Vasus,\nRudras, Vis'vedevas, Maruts, all worship the Supreme Deity of Creation,\nPreservation and Dissolution.\n\n\n\n35\\. Who is there amongst tho wise that does not serve this Highest Energy?\nThe real nature of that Auspicious Goddess, the Bestower all desires,\nSudars\xc2\x92ana came to know very well.\n\n\n\np. 194\n\n\n\n36\\. She is the Real Essence, Brahma, very rarely realised; She is the Higher\nVidya and the Lower Vidya (Avidya) and She is the vital energy, the Mukhya Pra\n_n_ a, of the best of the Yogis, who are desirous of liberation.\n\n\n\n37\\. O king! What individual is there that is able to realise the nature of\nPramatma (the Highest Universal Self) without having recourse to Her, Who is\nmanifesting this universal consciousness, by bringing into existence these\nSatvik, Rajasik, and Tamasik creations.\n\n\n\n38\\. Sudars'ana, though he dwelt in the forest, realised a greater happiness\nthan that in obtaining the sovereignty of a kingdom, by constantly meditating\non that Goddess.\n\n\n\n39\\. S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala, too, being too much oppressed with the arrows of love, any\nhow remained with her soul in her body, having had to be always cared for her\nhealth in various ways by her attendants.\n\n\n\n40\\. Then the king Subahu, on coming to know that her daughter is desirous of\ngetting her husband, made arrangements for her Svayambara (a marriage in which\nthe girl chooses her husband from among a number of suitors assembled\ntogether) without any delay.\n\n\n\n41-44. The Svayambara of the royal family, the Pundits say, is of three kinds\n:-- lst Ichchha Svayambara (optional); 2nd Pa _n_ ya Svayamvara by fulfilling\na promise, e.g. Ramachandra broke in two the bow of S\xc2\x92iva and married Sita;\n3rd the Svayambara, preferring one who will prove the strongest hero by one\xc2\x92s\nown prowess. Of these three kinds of Svayambaras, the king Subahu preferred\nIchcha Svayamvara (according to the bride's free choice).\n\n\n\nAccordingly the king employed many artisans, had platforms covered with\nbeautiful carpets and big halls decorated beautifully in various ways.\n\n\n\n45-47. Thus the assembly hall for Svayambara built and decorated and all the\nnecessary articles and equipments brought thither, the fair eyed S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala,\ntold her companions with sorrow \xc2\x93Better go to my mother and say her privately\nthat I have already selected mentally my husband the beautiful Sudars'ana, the\nson of the king Dhruvasandhi in my mind; I won't marry any other prince than\nhim; the Goddess Bhagavati has settled him for my husband.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n48-50. Vyasa said, the companion of S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala hearing thus, went quickly to\nher mother Vaidarbhi and addressed her sweetly in private \xc2\x93O chaste one! Your\ndaughter, with a sorrowful heart, has sent me to you to say the following;\nPlease hear and do at your earliest convenience, what is good and beneficial.\xc2\x94\nShe said \xc2\x93There is staying in the hermitage of Bharadvaja, the son of the king\nDhruvasandhi; I have mentally selected him as my husband; I won't select any\nother prince.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 195\n\n\n\n51\\. Vyasa said :-- The queen, hearing her words, told to her husband, when he\nreturned to the palace, all her daughter's words as she had heard them.\n\n\n\n52-53. Hearing this, the king Subahu was astonished and then laughed\nfrequently and then began to say to his wife, the daughter of the king of\nVidarbha the following true words :-- \xc2\x93O fair one! That king\xc2\x92s son Sudars\xc2\x92ana\nis a minor, he has been exiled to the forest; now he is helpless and is\nresiding with his mother in a dense forest.\n\n\n\n54\\. For his sake, the king Virasena was slain in battle by the king Yudhajit.\nO fair eyed! how can that helpless exiled poor boy become her husband.\n\n\n\n55\\. Do say therefore to S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala that, in the assembly hall for her\nSvayamvara, many kings commanding honour and respect would be present. She\nwould then choose whomever she likes. She need not repeat such words any\nmore.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the Eighteenth Chapter of the 3rd Skandha about the Svayambara of\nS\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala, the daughter of the king Kasiraja in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad\nDevi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 19](bk03ch19.htm)\n\n"
