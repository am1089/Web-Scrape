The law of castes and of orders has been declared. 1\n\n2\\. Now, indeed, man (in) this (world is polluted) by a vile action or acts\nwrongly, (e.g.) sacrifices for men. unworthy to offer a sacrifice, accepts\npresents from those whose gifts ought not to be accepted, eats the food of\nthose whose food ought not to be eaten, (and) practises what is forbidden. 2\n\n3\\. They are in doubt if he shall perform a penance for such (a deed) or if he\nshall not do it.\n\n4\\. (They declare that he shall not do it) because the deed does not perish.\n\n5\\. (The correct opinion is) that he shall perform (a penance). 5\n\n6\\. It is declared in the Veda, 'Let him offer a Punastoma; (those who offer\nit, may) again come to (partake of) the libations of Soma.' 6\n\n7\\. He who offers a horse-sacrifice conquers all sin, he effaces the guilt of\nthe murder of a Brahma _n_ a.' 7\n\np. 311\n\n8\\. Moreover, 'He who is being accused (of a heinous crime) shall perform an\nAgnish _t_ ut sacrifice.'\n\n9\\. Reciting the Veda, austerity, a sacrifice, fasting, giving gifts are the\nmeans for expiating such (a blamable act).\n\n10\\. The purificatory (texts are), the Upanishads, the initial (verses) of the\nVedas, the ends of the Vedas (vedantas), the Sa _m_ hitas of all the Vedas,\n(the Anuvakas called) Madhu, (the hymn of) Aghamarsha _n_ a, the Atharva _s_\niras, (the Anuvakas called the) Rudras, the Purusha hymn, the two Samans\n(called) Ra _g_ ina and Rauhi _n_ eya, the B _ri_ hat (Saman) and the\nRathantara, the Purushagati (Saman), the Mahanamnis, the Mahavaira _g_ a\n(Saman), the Mahadivakirtya (Saman), any of the _G_ yesh _th_ a Samans, the\nBahishpavamana Saman, the Kushma _n_ _d_ is, the Pavamanis, and the Savitri.\n10\n\n11\\. To live on milk alone, as if one were fasting, to eat vegetables only, to\neat fruit only, (to live on) gruel prepared of a handful of barley-grains, to\neat gold, to eat clarified butter (are the modes of subsistence) which purify.\n\n12\\. All mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, bathing-places, the dwellings of\n_Ri_ shis, cowpens, (holy) plains and temples of the gods (are) places (which\ndestroy sin) 12\n\np. 312\n\n13\\. Abstention from injuring living beings, truthfulness, abstention from\ntheft (or unrighteously appropriating anything), bathing in the morning, at\nnoon, and in the evening, obedience towards Gurus, continence, sleeping on the\nground, dressing in one garment only, and abstaining from food (are the\nvarious kinds of) austerity.\n\n14\\. Gold, a cow, a dress, a horse, land, sesamum, clarified butter, and food\n(are) the gifts.\n\n15\\. A year, six months, four (months), three (months), two (months), one\n(month), twenty-four days, twelve days, six days, three days, a day and a\nnight, (and) one day are the periods (for penances).\n\n16\\. These (acts) may be optionally performed if no (particular penance) has\nbeen prescribed,\n\n17\\. (Viz.) for great crimes difficult (penances) and for trivial faults easy\nones.\n\n18\\. The K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra and the Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra, as well as the _K_\nandraya _n_ a, are penances for all (offences).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[310:1](sbe1482.htm#fr_1392) **10**. As stated formerly, Sacred Books of the\nEast, vol. ii, p. li this chapter is borrowed from Gautama XIX. I have\ntherefore adopted the same division of the Sutras as in the translation of the\nlatter work.\n\n[310:2](sbe1482.htm#fr_1393) I read, with the MSS. of the commentary, atha\nkhalvaya _m_ purusho yapyena karma _n_ a mithya va _k_ araty ayagya _m_ va\nyagayaty apratigrahyasya va pratig _ri_ h _n_ aty ana _s_ yannasya vannam a\n_s_ naty a _k_ ara _n_ iyena va _k_ arati. M. reads ya _g_ ayitva, and the\nDekhan MSS. ya _g_ ayitva and pratig _ri_ hya.\n\n[310:5](sbe1482.htm#fr_1394) The Dekhan MSS. read kuryad ity eva, M. kuryad\neva, and Govinda kuryat tv eva.\n\n[310:6](sbe1482.htm#fr_1395) All the MSS. of the text omit the word vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nayate, 'it is declared in the Veda,' which is given by Govinda.\n\n[310:7](sbe1482.htm#fr_1396) All the MSS. of the text give at the beginning of\nthis Sutra p. 311 athapy udaharanti, 'now they quote also,' which Govinda\nomits, and which is inappropriate, because the following passages are taken\nfrom the Veda.\n\n[311:10](sbe1482.htm#fr_1397) The word vedadaya _h_ , which occurs also in\nsome MSS. of Vasish _th_ a (XXII, 9), must be explained, according to the\nanalogy of karmadi, the beginning of the sacrifices' (Saya _n_ a on Taitt. \xc3\x82r.\nII, 7, 5), by 'the initial verses of the Vedas.' The Pavamanis are added on\nthe authority of Govinda alone.\n\n[311:12](sbe1482.htm#fr_1398) 'Kshetra, (holy) plains, e.g. the Kurukshetra.'\n--Govinda.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na IV, Adhyaya 1](sbe1483.htm)\n\n"
