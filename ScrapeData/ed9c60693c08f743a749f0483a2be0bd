Now Indra, when he had hurled the thunderbolt at V\n_ri_ tra, thinking himself to be the weaker, and fearing lest he had not laid\nhim low, hid himself. The gods also hid themselves away in the same place.\n\n4:1:3:22\\. The gods then said, 'Verily, we know not if V _ri_ tra be slain or\nalive: come, let one of us find out, if V _ri_ tra be slain or alive!'\n\n4:1:3:33\\. They said unto Vayu--Vayu, forsooth, is he that blows yonder--'Find\nthou out, O Vayu, if V _ri_ tra be slain or alive; for thou art the swiftest\namong us: if he lives, thou indeed wilt quickly return hither.'\n\n4:1:3:44\\. He spake, 'What shall be my reward then?'--'The first Vasha _t_ of\nking Soma!'--'So be it!' so Vayu went, and lo 2 V _ri_ tra slain. He spake, 'V\n_ri_ tra is slain: do ye with the slain what ye list!'\n\np. 266\n\n4:1:3:55\\. The gods rushed thither,--as (those) eager to take possession of\ntheir property, so (it fared with) him (V _ri_ tra--Soma) 1: what (part of\nhim) one of them seized, that became an ekadevatya (graha, belonging to one\ndeity), and what two of them, that became a dvidevatya 2, and what many\n(seized), that became a bahudevatya;--and because they caught him up each\nseparately (vi-grah) by means of vessels, therefore (the libations) are called\ngraha.\n\n4:1:3:66\\. He stank in their nostrils,--sour and putrid he blew towards them:\nhe was neither fit for offering, nor was he fit for drinking.\n\n4:1:3:77\\. The gods said to Vayu, 'Vayu, blow thou through him, make him\npalatable for us!' He said, 'What shall be my reward then?'--'After thee they\nshall name those cups.'--'So be it!' he said, 'but blow ye along with me!'\n\n4:1:3:88\\. The gods dispelled some of that smell, and laid it into the cattle,\n--this is that foul smell in (dead) cattle: hence one must not close (his\nnose) at that foul smell, since it is the smell of king Soma.\n\n4:1:3:99\\. Nor must one spit thereat 3; even though he should think himself\never so much affected, let him\n\np. 267\n\ngo round it windward 1; for Soma means eminence, and disease meanness: even as\nat the approach of his superior the meaner man would get down (from his seat),\nso does disease go down before him (Soma).\n\n4:1:3:1010\\. Then Vayu blew a second time through him and thereby made him\npalatable; whereupon he was fit for offering and fit for drinking. Hence those\n(vessels), though belonging to various deities, are called 'vayavya (Vayu's\nvessels) 2.' His (Vayu's) is that first Vasha _t_ of king Soma, and, moreover,\nthose vessels are named after him.\n\n4:1:3:1111\\. Indra then thought within himself:--'Vayu, forsooth, has the\nlargest share of this our sacrifice, since his is the first Vasha _t_ of king\nSoma, and, moreover, those vessels are named after him: nay, but I, too, will\ndesire a share therein!'\n\n4:1:3:1212\\. He said, 'Vayu, let me share in this cup!'--'What will then\nbe?'--'Speech shall speak intelligibly 3!'--'If speech will speak\nintelligibly, then will I let thee share!' Thus that cup henceforward belonged\nto Indra and Vayu, but theretofore it belonged to Vayu alone.\n\n4:1:3:1313\\. Indra said, 'One half of this cup is mine!'--'Only one fourth is\nthine!' said Vayu.--'One half is mine!' said Indra.--'Only one fourth is\nthine!' said Vayu.\n\n4:1:3:1414\\. They went to Pra _g_ apati for his decision. Pra _g_ apati\ndivided the cup (of Soma) into two parts and said, 'This (half) is Vayu's!'\nThen he divided the (other) half into two parts and said, 'This is\n\np. 268\n\n[paragraph continues] Vayu's!--This is thine!' then he assigned to Indra a\nfourth part for his share--one fourth is the same as a quarter: henceforward\nthat cup belonged, one fourth of it, to Indra.\n\n4:1:3:1515\\. Now with this libation there are two puroru _k_  1\\--formulas,--\nthe first belonging to Vayu alone, and the second to Indra and Vayu; and two\ninvitatory prayers (anuvakya),--the, first to Vayu alone, and the second to\nIndra and Vayu; and two praisha (directions),--the first belonging to Vayu\nalone, and the second to Indra and Vayu; and two offering prayers (ya _g_ ya),\n--the first to Vayu alone, and the second to Indra and Vayu: thus he assigns\nto him (Indra) each time a fourth part for his share.\n\n4:1:3:1616\\. He said, 'If they have assigned to me a fourth part each time for\nmy share, then speech shall speak intelligibly only one fourth part!' Hence\nonly that fourth part of speech is intelligible which men speak; but that\nfourth part of speech which beasts speak is unintelligible; and that fourth\npart of speech which birds speak is unintelligible; and that fourth part of\nspeech which the small vermin here speaks is unintelligible.\n\n4:1:3:1717\\. Wherefore it has been thus spoken by the _Ri_ shi (Rig-veda I,\n164, 45):--'Four are the measured grades of speech; the Brahmans that are wise\nknow them: three, deposited in secret, move not; the fourth grade of speech\nmen speak.'\n\n4:1:3:1818\\. He now draws (the graha) from that (stream of Soma) 2, with (Va\n_g_. S. VII, 7; Rig-veda VII, 92, I), 'Come nigh to us, O Vayu, sipping of\n\np. 269\n\nthe pure (Soma)! Thine are a thousand steeds, O bestower of all boons! Unto\nthee hath been offered the gladdening juice whereof thou, O God, takest the\nfirst draught!--Thee for Vayu!'\n\n4:1:3:1919\\. And, having withdrawn (the cup), he again fills it\n[1](sbe2643.htm#fn_645), with (Va _g_. S. VII, 8; Rig veda I, 2, 4), 'O Indra\nand Vayu, here is Soma-juice: come ye hither for the refreshing draught, the\ndrops long for you!--Thou art taken with a support [2](sbe2643.htm#fn_646)!--\nThee for Vayu, for Indra and Vayu!'--with 'This is thy womb\n[3](sbe2643.htm#fn_647): thee for the closely united!' he deposits (the cup).\nAs to why he says, 'Thee for the closely united,'--he who is Vayu, is Indra;\nand he who is Indra, is Vayu: therefore he says, 'This is thy womb: thee for\nthe closely united!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[265:1](sbe2642.htm#fr_637) That is, to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a's body (madhyadeha, Say.)\nas distinguished from his limbs.
