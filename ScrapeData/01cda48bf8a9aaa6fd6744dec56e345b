Krishnu replied, "Observe that smoke, which appears some\ndistance off. The inhabitants of Muttra are offering sacrifice secretly from\nfear of Kuns: go to them, and having mentioned my name, and made an obeisance,\nstand before them with hands joined; and from a distance ask for food with the\nsame humility, as meek beggars ask for it."\n\nThe cowherds, after hearing this speech, went to the spot where the\ninhabitants of Muttra were sacrificing, (were seated preparing the sacrifice.)\nHaving gone, and paid their respects, they said with the greatest humility,\njoining their hands,--"O great kings! Shree Krishnu Chund Jee has, with\ndeferential respect, sent this message to you through us, he is very hungry,\nand would be much obliged if you would kindly send him something to eat." When\nthe inhabitants of Muttra had heard this message from the cowherds, they\nreplied angrily, "You must be very hungry to make such a request at this time;\nwe will not give any one any thing until the\n\np. 80\n\nsacrifice is completed, when we have made the offering; if any thing remains,\nwe will distribute it." The cowherds, imploring them again earnestly, said\nwith importunity,--"O great kings! it is an act of great virtue to give food\nto a hungry man, who comes to your house." They listened not to what the\ncowherds urged; but turning away from them, said to each other--"These are\nvery foolish, low cowherds, who beg for food in the middle of a sacrifice."\nThe cowherds, returning thence displeased and with great regret, came and said\nto Krishnu,--"O great king! we have forfeited our dignity and character by\nbegging, and have not obtained any thing to eat: what shall we do now?" Shree\nKrishnu Jee said, "Go and ask their wives: they are very kind and virtuous.\nObserve their affection: on seeing you, they will give you food with the\nutmost respect and deference." Having heard this, the cowherds went to the\nplace, where the wives were cooking, and [said to them](errata.htm#2), "Shree\nKrishnu has become hungry, while pasturing cows in the jungle, and has sent us\nto you--if you have any thing to eat, give it us." They were delighted on\nhearing these words from the cowherds, and ran off and brought gold dishes,\nfilled with food of all sorts and flavours--and would not admit any one\nhindering or preventing them.\n\nA woman of Muttra, whose husband would not allow her to go, having meditated\nand quitted her body, arrived before them all, and joined Krishnu\'s party, in\nthe same way that water mixes (or unites) with water. And after her the rest\nof the. women came to the place where Krishnu was standing with the cowherds\'\nchildren under the shade of a tree, with his hand on a companion\'s shoulder,\nhis figure bent, and a lotus in his hand. On approaching him they placed the\ndishes before him, and having made an obeisance, they said to each other, on\nbeholding the countenance of Huri, "Friend! this is Nund\'s son; let us\ncompletely gratify our eyes by looking at the moonlike face of him, on whom we\nmeditated upon hearing his\n\np. 81\n\nname; and let us receive the fruit, (that is,) the darling object of our\nlives." Conversing thus, and joining their hands together, they began to say\nin a tone of solicitation to Krishnu, "O lord of compassion! except through\nyour mercy, who can obtain a sight of you. Great is our good fortune to-day,\nthat we have seen you, and got rid of all our sins in every birth!\n\n"The foolish, avaricious proud priests, whose minds have been stained by the\nspirit, avarice and fascination of wealth, regarded God as man. How shall men,\nblinded by delusion, recognize the difference? Why should they not give food\nto him, to whom they offer up prayers, penance, sacrifice and love?\n\n"O great king! that wealth, those mortals, and that modesty are advantageous,\nwhich may be useful to you; and likewise the penance, prayers and knowledge,\nby which your name is celebrated." After hearing this, Shree Krishnu Chund,\nhaving made enquiries about their welfare and condition, said, "Do not make\nobeisance to me, I am merely the child of the chief Nund. Do they who cause\nthemselves to be worshipped by Brahmins\' wives, obtain greatness in the world?\nknowing me to be hungry, you took compassion, and thought of me in the jungle.\nHow shall I now entertain you? Brindabun, my home, is far off; how shall I be\nable to treat you with proper dignity and respect? If I were there, I would\nbring flowers and fruits, and place them before you. You have suffered\ninconvenience on my account by coming into the jungle; and I regret, that I\nhave not been able to serve you in any way." He said again in the same\ncomplaisant manner, "It is a long time since you came here: be pleased now to\ngo home, as the Brahmins, your husbands, will be expecting you; because the\nsacrifice is not propitious without the presence of the wife." Having heard\nthis speech of Krishnu\'s, they said, joining their hands, "O great king! we\nfixing our affections on your lotus-like\n\np. 82\n\nfeet, have abandoned all feelings of consideration for our families and\nrelatives. How can we return to those, in disobedience to whose injunctions we\ncame here? If they will not admit us into their houses, where shall we live;\nfor which reason it is better that we should remain under your protection. And\nlord, one of our women, from a wish to see you, was coming here, her husband\nstopped her, and the wife being distracted resigned her life." When Krishnu\nheard this, he laughed, and showed them the woman who had quitted her body,\nand said, "They who show love for Huri are never destroyed. She came here\nbefore you all." Having narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! on seeing her, they were all astonished. Afterwards, when they recovered\ntheir understanding, they began to sing the virtues of Huri. In the meantime\nKrishnu having eaten the food they gave him, said to them, "Return home now,\nyour husbands will not say any thing." When Shree Krishnu had thus explained\nto them, having made their salutations they took their departure and went\nhome. And their husbands, engaged in thought and expressing great regret,\ncontinued saying, "We have heard a story in the Pooranus, that at one time\nNund and Jusodha performed great penance for a son; and Bhugwan came and gave\nthem a promise, that he would descend upon the earth in the family of Judoo,\nand go to their house. He has been born, and it was he, who sent to procure\nfood through the cowherds\' children. What have we done in refusing food to\nKrishnu, when he asked it? To-day we have not gone into the presence of him,\nfor whose sake sacrifice and religion have been established. We regarded\nKrishnu as a mortal, and did not listen to what the cowherds said. Accursed\nare our minds, and the performance of this sacrifice, that we did not\nrecognize Bhugwan, and worship him. Our wives are superior to us, who went in\nsuch a spirited manner to behold Krishnu, and gave him food with their own\nhands, without having\n\np. 83\n\noffered prayers, penance or sacrifice." Thus expressing their regret, the\ninhabitants of Muttra said in presence of their wives, joining their hands,\n"Great is your good fortune in having seen Huri, your lives have been most\npropitious."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXV](psa26.htm)\n\n'
