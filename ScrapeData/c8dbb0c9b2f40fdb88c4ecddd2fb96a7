It was as if the Ganges had touched the ashes of the sixty\nthousand sons of Sagar  18 which no fire could enkindle, no other water knead\nagain into living clay. The ashes of lifeless Bengal suddenly spoke up: "Here\nam I."\n\nI have read somewhere that in ancient Greece a sculptor had the good fortune\nto impart life to the image made by his own hand. Even in that miracle,\nhowever, there was the process of form preceding life. But where was the unity\nin this heap of barren ashes? Had they been hard like stone, we might have had\nhopes of some form emerging, even as Ahalya, though turned to stone, at last\nwon back her humanity. But these scattered ashes must have dropped to the dust\nthrough gaps in the Creator\'s fingers, to be blown hither and thither by the\nwind. They had become heaped up, but were never before united. Yet in this day\nwhich had come to Bengal, even this collection of looseness had taken shape,\nand proclaimed in a thundering voice, at our very door: "Here I am."\n\nHow could we help thinking that it was all supernatural? This moment of our\nhistory seemed to have dropped into our hand like a jewel from the crown of\nsome drunken god. It had no resemblance to our past; and so we were led to\nhope that all our wants and miseries would disappear by the spell of some\nmagic charm, that for us there was no longer any boundary line between the\npossible and the impossible. Everything seemed to be saying to us: "It is\ncoming; it has come!"\n\nThus we came to cherish the belief that our history needed no steed, but that\nlike heaven\'s chariot it would move with its own inherent power--At least no\nwages would have to be paid to the charioteer; only his wine cup would have to\nbe filled again and again. And then in some impossible paradise the goal of\nour hopes would be reached.\n\nMy husband was not altogether unmoved, but through all our excitement it was\nthe strain of sadness in him which deepened and deepened. He seemed to have a\nvision of something beyond the surging present.\n\nI remember one day, in the course of the arguments he continually had with\nSandip, he said: "Good fortune comes to our gate and announces itself, only to\nprove that we have not the power to receive it--that we have not kept things\nready to be able to invite it into our house."\n\n"No," was Sandip\'s answer. "You talk like an atheist because you do not\nbelieve in our gods. To us it has been made quite visible that the Goddess has\ncome with her boon, yet you distrust the obvious signs of her presence."\n\n"It is because I strongly believe in my God," said my husband, "that I feel so\ncertain that our preparations for his worship are lacking. God has power to\ngive the boon, but we must have power to accept it."\n\nThis kind of talk from my husband would only annoy me. I could not keep from\njoining in: "You think this excitement is only a fire of drunkenness, but does\nnot drunkenness, up to a point, give strength?"\n\n"Yes," my husband replied. "It may give strength, but not weapons."\n\n"But strength is the gift of God," I went on. "Weapons can be supplied by mere\nmechanics."\n\nMy husband smiled. "The mechanics will claim their wages before they deliver\ntheir supplies," he said.\n\nSandip swelled his chest as he retorted: "Don\'t you trouble about that. Their\nwages shall be paid."\n\n"I shall bespeak the festive music when the payment has been made, not\nbefore," my husband answered.\n\n"You needn\'t imagine that we are depending on your bounty for the music," said\nSandip scornfully. "Our festival is above all money payments."\n\nAnd in his thick voice he began to sing:\n\n"My lover of the unpriced love, spurning payments,  \nPlays upon the simple pipe, bought for nothing,  \nDrawing my heart away."\n\nThen with a smile he turned to me and said: "If I sing, Queen Bee, it is only\nto prove that when music comes into one\'s life, the lack of a good voice is no\nmatter. When we sing merely on the strength of our tunefulness, the song is\nbelittled. Now that a full flood of music has swept over our country, let\nNikhil practise his scales, while we rouse the land with our cracked voices:\n\n"My house cries to me: Why go out to lose your all?  \nMy life says: All that you have, fling to the winds!  \nIf we must lose our all, let us lose it: what is it worth after all?  \nIf I must court ruin, let me do it smilingly;  \nFor my quest is the death-draught of immortality.\n\n"The truth is, Nikhil, that we have all lost our hearts. None can hold us any\nlonger within the bounds of the easily possible, in our forward rush to the\nhopelessly impossible.\n\n"Those who would draw us back,  \nThey know not the fearful joy of recklessness.  \nThey know not that we have had our call  \nFrom the end of the crooked path.  \nAll that is good and straight and trim--  \nLet it topple over in the dust."\n\nI thought that my husband was going to continue the discussion, but he rose\nsilently from his seat and left us.\n\nThe thing that was agitating me within was merely a variation of the stormy\npassion outside, which swept the country from one end to the other. The car of\nthe wielder of my destiny was fast approaching, and the sound of its wheels\nreverberated in my being. I had a constant feeling that something\nextraordinary might happen any moment, for which, however, the responsibility\nwould not be mine. Was I not removed from the plane in which right and wrong,\nand the feelings of others, have to be considered? Had I ever wanted this--had\nI ever been waiting or hoping for any such thing? Look at my whole life and\ntell me then, if I was in any way accountable.\n\nThrough all my past I had been consistent in my devotion--but when at length\nit came to receiving the boon, a different god appeared! And just as the\nawakened country, with its _Bande Mataram_ , thrills in salutation to the\nunrealized future before it, so do all my veins and nerves send forth shocks\nof welcome to the unthought-of, the unknown, the importunate Stranger.\n\nOne night I left my bed and slipped out of my room on to the open terrace.\nBeyond our garden wall are fields of ripening rice. Through the gaps in the\nvillage groves to the North, glimpses of the river are seen. The whole scene\nslept in the darkness like the vague embryo of some future creation.\n\nIn that future I saw my country, a woman like myself, standing expectant. She\nhas been drawn forth from her home corner by the sudden call of some Unknown.\nShe has had no time to pause or ponder, or to light herself a torch, as she\nrushes forward into the darkness ahead. I know well how her very soul responds\nto the distant flute-strains which call her; how her breast rises and falls;\nhow she feels she nears it, nay it is already hers, so that it matters not\neven if she run blindfold. She is no mother. There is no call to her of\nchildren in their hunger, no home to be lighted of an evening, no household\nwork to be done. So; she flies to her tryst, for this is the land of the\nVaishnava Poets. She has left home, forgotten domestic duties; she has nothing\nbut an unfathomable yearning which hurries her on--by what road, to what goal,\nshe recks not.\n\nI, also, am possessed of just such a yearning. I likewise have lost my home\nand also lost my way. Both the end and the means have become equally shadowy\nto me. There remain only the yearning and the hurrying on. Ah! wretched\nwanderer through the night, when the dawn reddens you will see no trace of a\nway to return. But why return? Death will serve as well. If the Dark which\nsounded the flute should lead to destruction, why trouble about the hereafter?\nWhen I am merged in its blackness, neither I, nor good and bad, nor laughter,\nnor tears, shall be any more!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[18](hw22.htm#fr_17) The condition of the curse which had reduced them to\nashes was such that they could only be restored to life if the stream of the\nGanges was brought down to them.
