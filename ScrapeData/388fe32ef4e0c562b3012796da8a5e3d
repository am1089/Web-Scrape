It comprises the second and\nthird \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, and may be said to consist of three divisions, or three\nUpanishads. Their general title is Bahv _ri_ _k_ a-upanishad, sometimes\nMahaitareya-upanishad, while the Upanishad generally known as, Aitareya-\nupanishad comprises the 4th, 5th, and 6th adhyayas only of the second \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka.\n\nThe character of the three component portions of the Upanishad can best be\ndescribed in _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's own words (\xc3\x82r. III, 1, I, Introd. p. 306): 'There\nare three classes of men who want to acquire knowledge. The highest consists\nof those who have turned away from the world, whose minds are fixed on one\nsubject and collected, and who yearn to be free at once. For these a knowledge\nof Brahman is intended, as taught in the Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4-6. The middle class\nare those who wish to become free gradually by attaining to the world of Hira\n_n_ yagarbha. For them the knowledge and worship of Pra _n_ a (breath and\nlife) is intended, as explained in the Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 1-3. The lowest class\nconsists of those who do not care either for immediate or gradual freedom, but\nwho desire nothing but offspring, cattle, &c. For these the meditative worship\nof the Sa _m_ hita is intended, as explained in the third \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. They\ncling too strongly to the letter of the sacred text to be able to surrender it\nfor a knowledge either of Pra _n_ a (life) or of Brahman.'\n\nThe connexion between the Upanishad or rather the three Upanishads and the\nfirst \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka seems at first sight very slight. Still we soon perceive\nthat it would be impossible to understand the first Upanishad, without a\nprevious knowledge of the Mahavrata ceremony as described in the first \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka.\n\nOn this point too there are some pertinent remarks in _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's commentary\non the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka II, 1, 2. 'Our first duty,' he says, 'consists in\nperforming sacrifices, such as are described in the first portion of the\nVeda,, the Sa _m_ hitas, Brahma _n_ as, and, to a certain extent, in the \xc3\x82ra\n_n_ yakas also. Afterwards arises a desire for knowledge, which cannot be\nsatisfied except a man has first attained\n\np. 201\n\ncomplete concentration of thought (ekagrata). In order to acquire that\nconcentration, the performance of certain upasanas or meditations is enjoined,\nsuch as we find described in our Upanishad, viz. in \xc3\x82r. II, I-V.'\n\nThis meditation or, as it is sometimes translated, worship is of two kinds,\neither brahmopasana or pratikopasana. Brahmopasana or meditation on Brahman\nconsists in thinking of him as distinguished by certain qualities.\nPratikopasana or meditation on symbols consists in looking upon certain\nworldly objects as if they were Brahman, in order thus to withdraw the mind\nfrom the too powerful influence of external objects.\n\nThese objects, thus lifted up into symbols of Brahman, are of two kinds,\neither connected with sacrifice or not. In our Upanishad we have to deal with\nthe former class only, viz. with certain portions of the Mahavrata, as\ndescribed in the first \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. In order that the mind may not be\nentirely absorbed by the sacrifice, it is lifted up during the performance\nfrom the consideration of these sacrificial objects to a meditation on higher\nobjects, leading up at last to Brahman as pra _n_ a or life.\n\nThis meditation is to be performed by the priests, and while they meditate\nthey may meditate on a hymn or on a single word of it as meaning something\nelse, such as the sun, the earth, or the sky, but not vice versa. And if in\none _S_ akha, as in that of the Aitareyins, for instance, a certain hymn has\nbeen symbolically explained, the same explanation may be adopted by another\n_S_ akha also, such as that of the Kaushitakins. It is not necessary, however,\nthat every part of the sacrifice should be accompanied by meditation, but it\nis left optional to the priest in what particular meditation he wishes to\nengage, nor is even the time of the sacrifice the only right time for him to\nengage in these meditations.\n\n1\\. This is the path: this sacrifice, and this Brahman. This is the true 1.\n\n2\\. Let no man swerve from it, let no man transgress it.\n\np. 202\n\n3\\. For the old (sages) did not transgress it, and those who did transgress,\nbecame lost.\n\n4\\. This has been declared by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. VIII, 101, 14): 'Three (classes\nof) people transgressed, others settled down round about the venerable (Agni,\nfire); the great (sun) stood in the midst of the worlds, the blowing (Vayu,\nair) entered the Harits (the dawns, or the ends of the earth).'\n\n5\\. When he says: 'Three (classes of) people transgressed,' the three (classes\nof) people who transgressed are what we see here (on earth, born again) as\nbirds, trees, herbs, and serpents 1.\n\n6\\. When he says: 'Others settled down round about the venerable,' he means\nthose who now sit down to worship Agni (fire).\n\n7\\. When he says: 'The great stood in the midst of the worlds,' the great one\nin the midst of the world is meant for this \xc3\x82ditya, the sun.\n\n8\\. When he says: 'The blowing entered the Harits,' he means that Vayu, the\nair, the purifier, entered all the corners of the earth 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[201:1](sbe01202.htm#fr_504) Comm. The path is twofold, consisting of works\nand knowledge. Works or sacrifices have been described in the Sa _m_ hita, the\nBrahma _n_ a, and the first \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. Knowledge of Brahman forms the\nsubject of the second and third \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas. The true path is that of\nknowledge.\n\n[202:1](sbe01202.htm#fr_505) Va\xe1\xb9\x85ga _h_ is explained by vanagata v _ri_ ksha\n_h_ ; avagadha _h_ is explained by vrihiyavadya oshadhaya _h_ ; irapada _h_ is\nexplained by ura _h_ pada _h_ sarpa _h_. Possibly they are all old ethnic\nnames, like Va\xe1\xb9\x85ga, _K_ era, &c. In \xc3\x82nandatirtha's commentary vaya _m_ si are\nexplained by Pi _s_ a _k_ a, Va\xe1\xb9\x85avagadhas by Rakshasa, and \xc3\x8erapadas by Asuras.\n\n[202:2](sbe01202.htm#fr_506) Three classes of men go to Naraka (hell); the\nfourth class, full of faith and desirous of reaching the highest world,\nworships Agni, Vayu, and other gods.
