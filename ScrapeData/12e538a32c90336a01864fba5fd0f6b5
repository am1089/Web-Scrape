The Ordeal of the Hot Piece of Gold.\n\n343. 343 Now I shall give a description of the ordeal of the hot piece of gold, which has been ordained by Brahman himself for the purpose of distinguishing virtue from vice.\n\n* 344. (The judge), after having cleansed himself, shall quickly pour clarified butter into a golden, silver, iron, or earthen vessel, and shall place the vessel on the fire.\n\n* 345. He shall throw into it a shining coin, made k of gold, silver, copper, or iron, after having washed it in water more than once.\n\n* 346. 346 Should (the coin) ever drop into the boiling (mixture), it would be a very dangerous thing to touch him (the fire?). Therefore he must address the clarified butter with the following prayer:\n\n* 347. \xc2\x91Thou art the best instrument of purification, O clarified butter, and (comparable to) Ambrosia\n\np. 120\n\nat a sacrifice. Burn this man at once if he is criminal, and be as cold as ice\nto him if he is innocent.\xc2\x92\n\n* 348. 348 If, on touching and examining the forefinger (of the defendant) it is found to be unhurt and to show no boils, he is innocent. Otherwise, he is not (innocent).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[119:343](sbe3333.htm#fr_341) 343-348. The ordeal of the hot piece of gold\n(Taptamasha) derives its name from the gold coin (masha) or signet-ring\n(mudrika), which those who are tried by this ordeal are required to pick out\nof a vessel filled with a boiling liquid, with the thumb and forefinger. They\nare declared innocent, if the hand remains unhurt.\n\n[119:346](sbe3333.htm#fr_342) The reading of the first half of this paragraph\nis quite uncertain, and the above rendering conjectural.\n\n[120:348](sbe3333.htm#fr_343) Some writers refer to two further ordeals,\nbesides the seven kinds mentioned by Narada. One of them is the ordeal of the\nred-hot ploughshare, which the defendant is made to lick. The other consists\nof drawing lots.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Second Title of Law. Deposits](sbe3334.htm)\n\n'
