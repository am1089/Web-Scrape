Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93The getting back of another similar body by Vas\xc2\x92i\n_st_ ha is certainly described by you. Now tell me how the King Nimi got\nanother body.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n2-31. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Ri _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha only got back his\nbody; but the King Nimi did not get back his body what had been cursed by\nVas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha. The priests engaged at the sacrifice by Nimi began to consider,\nwhen the Ri _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha cursed him, in the following way :-- Oh! What\na wonderful thing is this? Before the sacrifice is complete, the King Nimi has\nbeen cursed; this is against what we had expected; What can we do? What is\ninevitable must come to pass; how can we thwart it? By various Mantrams, they\nkept alive the body of the King in which breathing was still going on a\nlittle; and they prevented the body from decaying by worshipping the body with\nvarious Mantra S\xc2\x92aktis and kept it in a stationary state. When the sacrificial\nceremony was completed, the Ri _s_ is began to praise the gods with hymns\nwhereon the Devas became pleased and came to that spot. When the Munis\ninformed the Devas fully of the condition of the King\xc2\x92s body, the Devas spoke\nto the sorrowful King thus :-- \xc2\x93O Performer of good vows! We are all pleased\nwith your sacrifice; now ask boons from us. O King! You ought to get an\nexcellent birth as the fruit of performing this sacrifice. So ask what body,\nthe body of a Deva or of a man, you desire? Or you can ask, if you like, for\nanother similar body, that your priest Brihaspati has got quitting his first\nbody whereby he has become proud and is now staying in the Loka of Yama.\xc2\x94 O\nKing! At these words the King Nimi was very glad and spoke to them thus :-- O\nDevas! I have no aspiration for the body that is always liable to destruction;\nI therefore want to reside on the top of the eyelids of all the beings.\nTherefore I ask this boon that I be able to move in the shape of Vayu (air) on\nthe top of the eyes of all the beings. Thus said, the Devas spoke to the soul\nof Nimi :-- \xc2\x93O King! Pray to the most auspicious Deity, the Devi, the Highest\nGoddess. She has been pleased with this sacrifice; therefore your prayer will\ncertainly be granted.\xc2\x94 Hearing thus, the King began to pray with various hymns\nwith intense devotion, in tremulous voice, the Devi. The Devi became pleased\nand\n\n\n\np. 535\n\n\n\nappeared before him. Seeing Her shining like a crore of suns and looking\nexceedingly lovely and beautiful, all the persons there became very happy.\nThey began to think themselves as very blessed and as having done all what\nthey had to do. Knowing the Devi Bhagavati pleased, the King asked this boon\nfrom her :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! Give me that knowledge, pure and simple, whereby final\nliberation is obtained. Also, I may be able to reside on the top of the eyes\nof all the beings.\xc2\x94 The Devi, the Lord of the Devas, the Mother of the World\nbeing highly pleased, said thus :-- \xc2\x93O King! At the expiry of this your\nPrarabdha Karma, you will acquire pure knowledge and you will reside on the\ntops of the eyes in the shape of Vayu, and through your residing there the\nbeings will twinkle, i.e., open and close their eyes. The men, beasts, and\nbirds will twinkle due to your residing there; but the Immortals will always\nremain with a steadfast gaze; they will not twinkle.\xc2\x94 Thus granting him the\nboon, and addressing all the Munis the Bhagavati, the Highest Deity,\ndisappeared. When the Devi disappeared from their sight, the Munis then\nthought much and they took the body of the King Nimi to burn it duly. For the\nsake of getting a son from Nimi, the high-souled Munis performed Homa ceremony\n(oblations to the fire) and placing the piece of wood Arani on his body began\nto utter Mantrams and burned his body. When the woods were thus burned, a son,\nendowed with all auspicious signs, looking like a second Nimi, was born to\nthem. As this son was born due to the burning of the Aranis, the boy was named\nMithi, and as it came out of the body of Janaka, the boy was named Janaka. O\nKing! As the King Nimi lost his body, i.e., became Videha through the curse of\nVas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, all his descendants were known as Videha. Thus the son of Nimi\nwas well known as the King Janaka. He built a beautiful city on the banks of\nthe Ganges; the city became famous also by his name (Janakapuri). The King\nJanaka beautified this city with many forts, arcades, markets and many nice\nbuildings and palaces; and his city was full of wealth and grains. O King! All\nthe Kings of this line became famous by the name of Janaka and all were\nendowed with the Supreme knowledge and known as Videha. O King! I have now\ndescribed to you the story of the King Nimi who got disembodiedness\n(Videhatva) out of the curse.\n\n\n\n32-35. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! You have described the cause why the\nKing Nimi was cursed; my mind has grown very doubtful and restless on hearing\nit. The Ri _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha was the son of Brahma and the best of the\nBrahmi _n_ s; especially he was the royal priest; how was it, then, that he\nwas cursed by the King! Why did not the King Nimi forgive him as he was the\nGuru and a Brahmi _n_? Why he became angry, when he performed such a great,\nauspicious sacrifice? He\n\n\n\np. 536\n\n\n\nwas born of the family of Ik _s_ aku and he knew well the truths of the\nreligion; then how was it that he became subject to anger and cursed his own\nGuru Brahmi _n_.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n36-46. Vyasa said :-- O King! It is very hard and rare for the persons not\npossessed of self-restraint to forgive; especially when one is fully capable,\nit is very rare to find one in the three worlds, who can forgive. He who has\nforsaken all attachments and has conquered hunger and sleep and is always\nengaged in the Yoga practices, even that ascetic Muni is not capable to\nconquer completely lust, anger and greed and Ahamkara, etc., the passions\nraging in the mortal coil. None existed before in this whole world who\nconquered his passions! None exists now and none will be born ever-after.\nHardly will be seen any in this earth, or the Heavens, or the Loka of Brahma\nor in Vaiku _nt_ ha, even in Kailasa, that has conquered completely his\npassions! What can be said in regard to the ordinary mortals of this earth\nwhen the sons of Brahma, the Mahar _s_ is, ascetics, Ri _s_ is are all pierced\nby the Sattva, Rajas, or Tamo Gu _n_ as. Behold! The Kapila was the Knower of\nS\xc2\x92ankhya and always engaged in his Yoga practices and he was a pure and holy\nsoul; yet, by strange combinations of Fate, he became angry and burnt to ashes\nthe sons of the King Sagara. O King! Out of Ahamkara, these three worlds are\ncreated; therefore this world and Ahamkara are related to each other as effect\nand cause; how then the Jivas that are born of this Samsara can extricate\nthemselves from this Ahamkara? Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a are also pierced\nby those three Gu _n_ as; different feelings are seen in their different\nbodies. Therefore it need hardly be said that the manifestation of the pure\nSattva Gu _n_ a alone is not to be seen in any of the human beings; for the\nthree Gu _n_ as reside in a mixed way in all persons. Sometimes the Sattva\npreponderates; sometimes the Rajas and sometimes the Tamas preponderates.\nSometimes they reside together, the three balancing one other.\n\n\n\n47-63. O King! Only that Eternal Highest Puru _s_ a is undecaying and\nuntainted and can hardly be measured or seen by all the beings. That Highest\nSoul, the Highest of the High, is Nirgu _n_ a (void of the three Gu _n_ as);\nand She who resides in all the beings and is hardly knowable by the small\nintellectual persons, that Highest S\xc2\x92akti, the Incarnate of Brahma, is also\nNirgu _n_ a (void of attributes). Paramatma (the Highest Soul) and the Highest\nForce are also One; their Forms are not different. When such a knowledge\narises, then the Jivas can be free from all sins and faults and blemishes.\nFrom that knowledge comes the liberation, this is sounded in the Vedanta\nS\xc2\x92astra like _D_ in _d_ ima S\xc2\x92abda (thousands of small drums). He, who comes\nto know That, is freed from the endless cycle of birth and death composed of\nthe three Gu _n_ as; there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\np. 537\n\n\n\nO King! Knowledge is of two kinds :-- The first is considered as coming from\nsound; this comes out of the knowledge of the meaning of the Vedas by the help\nof intellect. But this is full of fancies, agreements and doubts some of which\nare bad and some are good. The beings are led into errors by these\ndiscussions; errors cause destruction of intellect; and when the intellect is\ngone, the knowledge also goes away with it. Whereas the second kind of\nknowledge comes from intention or feeling within the depths of heart and brain\nand it is called Aparok _s_ a J\xc3\xb1ana. This knowledge is very rare to the\nbeings. When one comes in contact with a Sad-Guru (a good teacher), then one\ngets this Aparok _s_ a J\xc3\xb1ana. From the sound knowledge, no successful results\ncan issue; and, therefore it cannot give Aparok _s_ a J\xc3\xb1ana. Hence great\neffort is to be made for getting this Aparok _s_ a J\xc3\xb1ana. O King! As darkness\ncannot be destroyed merely by talking of light, without lighting any lamp, so\nthe knowledge of sound merely cannot destroy the darkness of the inside. That\nKarma (action) is called True Karma which does not lead to bondage, and that\nKnowledge is the True Knowledge which leads to liberation. Other actions are\nonly meant for one\xc2\x92s own selfish enjoyments and other knowledges are merely\nthe skill in arts. Good behaviour, doing good to others, having no anger,\nforgiveness, patience, and contentment are the best brilliant fruits of True\nKnowledge. O King! Without knowledge, without asceticism, and without the Yoga\npractices, the lust and other passions can never be destroyed. The minds of\nthe Jivas are naturally restless and without control; all the beings are\ncompletely under the sway of their minds; thus they roam on the surface of the\nearth as good, middling and bad. Lust, anger, etc., orginate from this mind;\nand when mind is conquered, then those feelings can no more arise. O King!\nTherefore it was that Yayati forgave when S\xc2\x92ukracharya did wrong before. The\nKing Nimi could not forgive Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha in the same way. Yayati; the best of\nkings, though cursed by S\xc2\x92ukracharya, the son of Bhrigu, did not curse in\nreturn but he took upon himself the old age. O King! Some kings are naturally\npeaceful, whereas some other kings are wicked by their nature. Therefore, in\nthis matter, whose fault is this, how can we ascertain? See! In ancient times\nthe Haihayas, out of their greed of wealth, and being thus insensible\ndestroyed completely, out of anger, the Brahmi _n_ priests of the family of\nBhrigu. What more than this that those K _s_ attriyas did not consider the sin\nBrahmahattya; rather out of their dire anger, they cut to pieces the sons of\nthose Brahma _n_ as, that were in embryos in their mother\xc2\x92s wombs.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifteenth Chapter in the Sixth Book on the Nimi\xc2\x92s\n\n\n\np. 538\n\n\n\ngetting of another body and the beginning of the story of Haihayas, in the\nMahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 16](bk06ch16.htm)\n\n'
