Suta said :-- On the third day after the Pa _nd_ avas had returned to\nHastinapur, the king Dhritarastra was burnt up together with Gandhari and\nKunti, by the conflagration of fire in the forest. Sanjaya went away at that\ntime, leaving Dhritarastra in the forest, on a tour on pilgrimage. The king\nYudhisthira heard all this from Narada and was very sorry. Now after thirty\nsix years after the Kuru family had become extinct, all the descendants of\nYadu in the Prabhas tirtha were destroyed by the Brahma _n_ a\'s curse. The\nhigh-souled descendants of Yadu, intoxicated by drinking wine, fought against\neach other and were extirpated in the presence of Kri _sn_ a and Balaram.\nBalaram then quitted his mortal coil; the lotus-eyed Bhagavan Kri _sn_ a\nquitted his life, struck by the arrows of a hunter, to pay __ respect to a\nBrahmi _n_ \'s curse. Vasudeva heard of Hari\'s quitting his mortal coil, and\nmeditated the Goddess of the Universe within his heart and left his holy life.\nArjuna became very sorry; he went to Prabhasa and performed the funeral\nobsequies of all duly. Seeing the dead body of Hari, Arjuna collected fuel and\nburnt his body together with his eight principal wives; he burnt also\nBalaram\'s body with that of his wife Revati. Arjuna, then, went to the Dvaraka\ncity and removed all the inhabitants of the city when the whole Dwarka city of\nVasudeva was drowned in the waters of the ocean. While Arjuna was taking all\nthe persons with him after getting out of Dwarka, he felt himself very weak on\nthe way; and therefore a band of robbers, known by the name of \xc3\x82bhiras\nplundered all the wealth and all the wives of Kri _sn_ a. Arjuna, of\nindomitable valour, after his arrival at Indraprastha made Vajra, Aniruddha\'s\nson, the king of the place.\n\n\n\np. 103\n\n\n\nThen the highly powerful Arjuna informed Vyasa of his powerlessness when Vyasa\nsaid :--\xc2\x93O highly intelligent one! When Hari and you will reincarnate in\nanother Yuga, then your heroic strength will again be manifested. Hearing all\nthese words, Pritha\'s son Arjuna returned to Hastina with a sorrowful heart\nand informed everything to Yudhisthira, the Dharmaraja. Hearing the extinction\nof the Yadavas and Hari\'s quitting His mortal coil, Yudhisthira wanted to go\nto the Himalayas. He installed Pariksit, Uttara\'s son who was then thirty six\nyears old on the throne and went out of his palace in company of his brothers,\nand Draupadi to the forests of the Himalayas. Thus the Pa _nd_ avas, Pritha\'s\nson, reigned for thirty six years in Hastina and quitted their mortal coils in\nthe Himalayas. Here the greatly religious sage-king Pariksit governed with\nvigilance all his subjects for sixty years. After this, Pariksit went once on\nan hunting expedition to a dense forest and shot a deer. He then searched for\nthe deer and it became noon and he felt very thirsty, hungry, quite fatigued\nwith his body, perspiring, when he saw a Muni merged in meditation; he asked\nthe Muni \xc2\x93Where can water be had?\xc2\x94 But the Muni held at that time the vow of\nsilence; so he did not answer anything. Seeing this, the thirsty king,\ninfluenced by Kali, became angry and raised a dead serpent by the fore-end of\nhis bow and coiled it round the Muni\'s neck. Even thus coiled with a snake\nround his neck the Muni remained as before motionless in his state of\nenlightenment and spoke nothing. The king also returned home.\n\n\n\n24-49. Then the Muni\'s son, born from the cow\'s womb, S\xc2\x92ringi, a great\nascetic, a fiery devotee of Mahas\'akti, heard of the above event, while he was\nplaying in the forest. His friends spoke to him :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! Some body has now\nenclosed a dead serpent around the neck of your father.\xc2\x94 Hearing their words,\nS\xc2\x92ringi became very angry and taking water in his hands, cursed thus :-- \xc2\x93He\nwho has coiled to-day a dead serpent around my father\'s neck, let that villain\nbe bitten by the serpent Tak _s_ ak within one week from this day\xc2\x94. One\ndisciple of the Muni then went to the king in his house and informed him of\nthe Muni\'s curse. Abhimanyu\'s son Pariksit heard of the curse pronounced by a\nBrahmi _n_ , and knowing infallible, spoke to the aged councillors :--\n\n\n\n"O Ministers! Certainly it is through my fault that I have been cursed by a\nBrahmi _n_ \'s son. Now find out and settle what is to be done though the\npersons versed in the Vedas say that death is inevitable under these\ncircumstances; yet the wise ones should try their best to thwart this\naccording to the S\xc2\x92astras. Many sages who are the advocates of taking steps to\nredress any act, say that all the actions of wise persons are fructified by\nproper means; their solution does not remain unsolved.\n\n\n\np. 104\n\n\n\nTherefore I am saying that the powers of ma _n_ is, mantrams and herbs (o _s_\nadhis) are indescribable; if applied duly, do you think that they will bear no\nfruit in this case? I heard that when a Muni\'s wife died out of snake-bite,\nthe Muni gave away the half of his life to his wife Apsara and made her alive\nagain. It is not proper for the learned to depend on the maxim that what is\ninevitable must come to pass; one must try one\'s best to act for the living\npresent. O Ministers! Have you seen any person in the Heavens or in the world\nwho remains idle, depending on fate alone? The Sannyasins have renounced the\nworld; but they must have to go to the houses of the house-holders, whether\nthey be invited or not invited. See again. supposing that the food of a person\nis brought to him unasked and suppose it is thrown into the mouth by some one,\ncan you conceive that food would go down into the belly, from the mouth\nwithout one\'s effort? Therefore one should exert one\'s own prowess from the\nvery outset; though the intelligent ones should be satisfied with the thought\n\xc2\x93What can be done? It is not ordained in my fate.\xc2\x94 When Pariksit said thus,\nthe ministers asked :-- \xc2\x93Which Muni made his dead wife alive again, by giving\nher half his own life? And how did his wife die? Kindly describe all these in\ndetail to me.\xc2\x94 The king said :-- Bhrigu Muni had a very beautiful wife Puloma.\nIn her womb the world renowned Chyavana Muni was born. Sukanya, the daughter\nof S\xc2\x92aryati was the wife of Chyavana. In her womb was born a beautiful son\nnamed Pramati; he was very famous. Pramati had his famous beautiful wife\nPratapi. In her womb was born the great ascetic son Ruru. At this time a\nperson named Sthulakes\'a, a religious truthful man of great name, was\npractising tapasya. O Ministers! In the meanwhile, the chief Apsara Menaka\nheld sexual intercourse with Visvavasu Gandharva on the banks of a river and\nbecame pregnant. She went out from that place to the hermitage of Sthulakes\'a\non the river bank and gave birth to a very beautiful daughter. Seeing this\ngirl quite an orphan and very beautiful, the Muni Sthulakes\'a began to rear up\nher and named her Pramadvara. This all-auspicious girl Pramadvara attained\nyouth in due course when the Muni Ruru saw her and became smitten with\npassion.\n\n\n\nThus ends the eighth chapter of the Second Skandha on the extinction of the\nfamily of Yadu and on the anecdote of Pariksit in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad\nDevi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk02ch09.htm)\n\n'
