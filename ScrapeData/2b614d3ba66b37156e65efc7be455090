 \nI know not where, her steps untraced,  \nRoams Sita of the dainty waist.'  \n   When Rama heard the words he spoke  \nAgain he sank beneath the stroke,  \nAnd wiih a bosom anguish-fraught  \nHimself the lovely river sought.  \nThere standing on the shelving side,  \n'O Sita, where art thou?' he cried.  \n\nNo spirit voice an answer gave,  \nNo murmur from the trembling wave  \nOf sweet Godavari declared  \nThe outrage which the fiend had dared  \n'O speak!' the pitying spirits cried,  \nBut yet the stream their prayer denied,  \nNor dared she, coldly mute, relate  \nTo the sad chief his darling's fate  \nOf Ravan's awful form she thought,  \nAnd the dire deed his arm had wrought,  \nAnd still withheld by fear dismayed,  \nThe tale for which the mourner prayed.  \nWhen hope was none, his heart to cheer,  \nThat the bright stream his cry would hear  \nWhile sorrow for his darling tore  \nHis longing soul he spake once more:  \n'Though I have sought with tears and sighs  \nGodarvari no word replies,  \nO say, what answer can I frame  \nTo Janak father of my dame?  \nOr how before her mother stand  \nLeading no Sita by the hand?  \nWhere is my loyal love who went  \nForth with her lord to banishment?  \nHer faith to me she nobly held  \nThough from my realm and home expelled,--  \nA hermit, nursed on woodland fare,--  \nShe followed still and soothed my care.  \nOf all my friends am I bereft,  \nNor is my faithful consort left.  \nHow slowly will the long nights creep  \nWhile comfortless I wake and weep!  \nO, if my wife may yet be found,  \nWith humble love I'll wander round  \nThis Janasthan, Pras'ravan's hill,  \nMandakini's delightful rill.  \nSee how the deer with gentle eyes  \nLook on my face and sympathize.  \nI mark their soft expression: each  \nWould soothe me, if it could, with speech.'  \n   A while the anxious throng he eyed.  \nAnd 'Where is Sita, where?' he cried.  \nThus while hot tears his utterance broke  \nThe mourning son of Raghu spoke.  \nThe deer in pity for his woes  \nObeyed the summons and arose.  \nUpon his right thy stood, and raised  \nTheir sad eyes up to heaven and gazed  \nEach to that quarter bent her look  \nWhich Ravan with his captive took.  \nThen Raghu's son again they viewed,  \nAnd toward that point their way pursued.  \nThen Lakshman watched their looks intent  \nAs moaning on their way they went,  \nAnd marked each sign which struck his sense  \nWith mute expressive influence,  \nThen as again his sorrow woke  \nThus to his brother chief he spoke:  \n'Those deer thy eager question heard  \n\np. 305  \n\nAnd rose at once by pity stirred:  \nSee, in thy search their aid they lend,  \nSee, to the south their looks they bend.  \nArise, dear brother, let us go  \nThe way their eager glances show,  \nIf haply sign or trace descried  \nOur footsteps in the search may guide.'  \n   The son of Raghu gave assent,  \nAnd quickly to the south they went;  \nWith eager eyes the earth he scanned,  \nAnd Lakshman followed close at hand.  \nAn each to other spake his thought,  \nAnd round with anxious glances sought,  \nScattered before them in the way,  \nBlooms of a fallen garland lay.  \nWhen Rama saw that flowery rain  \nHe spoke once more with bitterest pain:  \n'O Lakshman every flower that lies  \nHere on the ground I recognize.  \nI culled them in the grove, and there  \nMy darling twined them in her hair.  \nThe sun, the earth, the genial breeze  \nHave spared these flowers my soul to please.'  \n   Then to that woody hill he prayed,  \nWhence flashed afar each wild cascade:  \n'O best of mountains, hast thou seen  \nA dome of perfect form and mien  \nIn some sweet spot with trees o'ergrown,-  \nMy darling whom I left alone?'  \nThen as a lion threats a deer  \nHe thundered with a voice of fear:  \n'Reveal her, mountain, to my view  \nWith golden limbs and golden hue.  \nWhere is my darling Sita? speak  \nBefore I rend thee peak from peak.'  \n   The mountain seemed her track to show,  \nBut told not all he sought to know.  \nThen Das'aratha's son renewed  \nHis summons as the mount he viewed:  \n'Soon as my flaming arrows fly,  \nConsumed to ashes shall thou lie  \nWithout a herb or bud or tree,  \nAnd birds no more shall dwell in thee.  \nAnd if this stream my prayer deny,  \nMy wrath this day her flood shall dry,  \nBecause she lends no aid to trace  \nMy darling of the lotus face.'  \n   Thus Rama spake as though his ire  \nWould scorch them with his glance of fire;  \nThen searching farther on the ground  \nThe footprint of a fiend he found,  \nAnd small light traces here and there,  \nWhere Sita in her great despair,  \nShrieking for Rama's help, had fled  \nBefore the giant's mighty tread.  \nHis careful eye each trace surveyed  \nWhich Sita and the fiend had made,--  \nThe quivers and the broken bow  \nAnd ruined chariot of the foe,--  \nAnd told, distraught by fear and grief,  \nHis tidings to his brother chief:  \n   'O Lakshman, here,' he cried 'behold  \nMy Sita's earrings dropped with gold.  \nHere lie her garlands torn and rent,  \nHere lies each glittering ornament.  \nO look, the ground on every side  \nWith blood-like drops of gold is dyed.  \nThe fiends who wear each strange disguise  \nHave seized, I ween, the helpless prize.  \nMy lady, by their hands o'erpowered,  \nIs slaughtered, mangled, and devoured.  \nMethinks two fearful giants came  \nAnd waged fierce battle for the dame.  \nWhose, Lakshman, was this mighty bow  \nWith pearls and gems in glittering row  \nCast to the ground the fragments lie,  \nAnd still their glory charms the eye.  \nA bow so mighty sure was planned  \nFor heavenly God or giant's hand.  \nWhose was this coat of golden mail  \nWhich, though its lustre now is pale,  \nShone like the sun of morning, bright  \nWith studs of glittering lazulite?  \nWhose, Lakshman, was this bloom-wreathed shade  \nWith all its hundred ribs displayed?  \nThis screen, most meet for royal brow,  \nWith broken staff lies useless now.  \nAnd these tall asses, goblin-faced,  \nWith plates of golden harness graced,  \nWhose hideous forms are stained with gore  \nWho is the lord whose yoke they bore?  \nWhose was this pierced and broken car  \nThat shoots a flame-like blaze afar?  \nWhose these spent shafts at random spread,  \nEach fearful with its iron head,--  \nWith golden mountings fair to see,  \nLong as a chariot's axle-tree?  \nThese quivers see, which, rent in twain,  \nTheir sheaves of arrows still contain.  \nWhose was this driver? Dead and cold,  \nHis hands the whip and reins still hold.  \nSee, Lakshman, here the foot I trace  \nOf man, nay, one of giant race.  \nThe hatred that I nursed of old  \nGrows mightier now a hundred fold  \nAgainst these giants, fierce of heart,  \nWho change their forms by magic art.  \nSlain, eaten by the giant press,  \nOr stolen is the votaress,  \nNor could her virtue bring defence  \nTo Sita seized and hurried hence.  \nO, if my love be slain or lost  \nAll hope of bliss for me is crossed.  \nThe power of all the worlds were vain  \nTo bring one joy to soothe my pain.  \nThe spirits with their blinded eyes  \nWould look in wonder, and despise  \nThe Lord who made the worlds, the great  \nCreator when compassionate.  \nAnd so, I ween, the Immortals turn  \nCold eyes upon me now, and spurn  \n\np. 306  \n\nThe weakling prompt at pity's call,  \nDevoted to the good of all.  \nBut from this day behold me changed,  \nFrom every gentle grace estranged.  \nNow be it mine all life to slay,  \nAnd sweep these cursed fiends away.  \nAs the great sun leaps up the sky,  \nAnd the cold moonbeams fade and die,  \nSo vengeance rises in my breast.  \nOne passion conquering all the rest.  \nGandharvas in their radiant place,  \nThe Yakshas, and the giant race,  \nKinnars and men shall look in vain  \nFor joy they ne'er shall see again.  \nThe anguish of my great despair,  \nO Lakshman, fills the heaven and air;  \nAnd I in wrath all life will slay  \nWithin the triple world to-day.  \nUnless the Gods in heaven who dwell  \nRestore my Sita safe and well,  \nI armed with all the fires of Fate.  \nThe triple world will devastate.  \nThe troubled stars from heaven shall fall,  \nThe moon be wrapped in gloomy pall,  \nThe fire be quenched, the wind be stilled,  \nThe radiant sun grow dark and chilled;  \nCrushed every mountain's towering pride,  \nAnd every lake and river dried,  \nDead every creeper, plant, and tree,  \nAnd lost for aye the mighty sea.  \nThou shalt the word this day behold  \nIn wild disorder uncontrolled,  \nWith dying life which naught defends  \nFrom the fierce storm my bowstring sends.  \nMy shafts this day, for Sita's sake,  \nThe life of every fiend shall take.  \nThe Gods this day shall see the force  \nThat wings my arrows on their course,  \nAnd mark how far that course is held,  \nBy my unsparing wrath impelled.  \nNo God, not one of Daitya strain,  \nGoblin or Rakshas shall remain.  \nMy wrath shall end the worlds, and all  \nDemons and Gods therewith shall fall.  \nEach world which Gods, the Danav race,  \nAnd giants make their dwelling place,  \nShall fall beneath my arrows sent  \nIn fury when my bow is bent.  \nThe arrows loosened from my string  \nConfusion on the worlds shall bring.  \nFor she is lost or breathes no more,  \nNor will the Gods my love restore.  \nHence all on earth with life and breath  \nThis day I dedicate to death.  \nAll, till my darling they reveal,  \nThe fury of my shafts shall feel.'  \n  Thus as he spake by rage impelled,  \nRed grew his eyes, his fierce lips swelled.  \nHis bark coat round his form he drew  \nAnd coiled his hermit braids anew.  \nLike Rudra when he yearned to slay  \nThe demon Tripur  [1](ry264.htm#fn_510) in the fray.  \nSo looked the hero brave and wise,  \nThe fury flashing from his eyes.  \nThen Rama, conqueror of the foe,  \nFrom Lakshman's hand received his bow,  \nStrained the great string, and laid thereon  \nA deadly dart that flashed and shone,  \nAnd spake these words as fierce in ire  \nAs He who ends the worlds with fire:  \n   'As age and time and death and fate  \nAll life with checkless power await,  \nSo Lakshman in my wrath to-day  \nMy vengeful might shall brook no stay,  \nUnless this day I see my dame  \nIn whose sweet form is naught to blame,--  \nYea, as before, my love behold  \nFair with bright teeth and perfect mould,  \nThis world shall feel a deadly blow  \nDestroyed with ruthless overthrow,  \nAnd serpent lords and Gods of air,  \nGandharvas, men, the doom shall share.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXVI.: Lakshman's Speech.](ry264.htm)\n\n"
