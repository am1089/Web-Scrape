The hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara is mind, the prastava speech, the udgitha sight, the pratihara\nhearing, the nidhana\n\np. 29\n\nbreath. That is the Gayatra Saman, as interwoven in the (five) pra _n_ as 1.\n\n2\\. He who thus knows this Gayatra interwoven in the pra _n_ as, keeps his\nsenses, reaches the full life, he lives long 2, becomes great with children\nand cattle, great by fame. The rule of him who thus meditates on the Gayatra\nis, 'Be not high-minded.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[28:3](sbe01045.htm#fr_140) After having explained the secret meaning of the\nwhole Sama-veda p. 29 ceremonial, as it is to be understood by meditation only\n(dhyana),he proceeds to explain the secret meaning of the same ceremonial,\ngiving to each its proper name in proper succession (gayatra, rathantara,\n&c.), and showing the hidden purport of those names.\n\n[29:1](sbe01045.htm#fr_141) Cf. _Kh_. Up. II, 7, 1, where pra _n_ a is\nexplained differently. The Gayatri itself is sometimes called pra _n_ a.\n\n[29:2](sbe01045.htm#fr_142) The commentator generally takes _g_ yok in the\nsense of bright.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 12](sbe01046.htm)\n\n"
