I will not dim  \nMine honour and be false to him.  \nSo, son of Raghu, leave me still  \nThe power to wander where I will,  \nAnd swifter than the thought my flight  \nShall place me on Mahendra's height.  \nMy mansions of eternal joy.  \nBy penance won, thou mayst destroy.  \nMy path to these thy shaft may stay.  \nNow to the work! No more delay!  \nI know thee Lord of Gods; I know  \nThy changeless might laid Madhu low.  \nAll other hands would surely fail  \nTo bend this bow. All hail! all hail!  \nSee! all the Gods have left the skies  \nTo bend on thee their eager eyes,  \nWith whose achievements none compete.  \nWhose arm in war no God can meet.  \nNo shame is mine. I ween, for thou,  \nLord of the Worlds, hast dimmed my brow.  \nNow, pious Rama, 'tis thy part  \nTo shoot afar that glorious dart:  \nI, when the fatal shaft is shot,  \nWill seek that hill and tarry not.'  \n\nHe ceased. The wondrous arrow flew,  \nAnd Jamadagni's offspring knew  \nThose glorious worlds to him were barred,  \nOnce gained by penance long and hard.  \nThen straight the airy quarters cleared,  \nAnd the mid regions bright appeared,  \nWhile Gods and saints unnumbered praised  \nRama, the mighty bow who raised.  \nAnd Jamadagni's son, o'erawed.  \nExtolled his name with highest laud,  \n\np. 88  \n\nWith reverent steps around him strode,  \nThen hastened on his airy road.  \nFar from the sight of all he fled,  \nAnd rested on Mahendra's head.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXVII.: Bharat's Departure.](ry077.htm)\n\n"
