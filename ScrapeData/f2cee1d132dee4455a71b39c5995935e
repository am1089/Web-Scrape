After the age of thirty he began to\nreform, and he brought such zeal to the good cause, that in an incredibly\nshort space of time he came to be accounted and quoted as the paragon of\ncorrect Rajas. This was very praiseworthy. Many of Brahma\'s vicegerents on\nearth, be it observed, have loved food and drink, and music and dancing, and\nthe worship of Kama, to the end of their days.\n\nAmongst his officers was Gunshankar, a magistrate of police, who, curious to\nsay, was as honest as he was just. He administered equity with as much care\nbefore as after dinner; he took no bribes even in the matter of advancing his\nfamily; he was rather merciful than otherwise to the poor, and he never\npunished the rich ostentatiously, in order to display his and his law\'s\ndisrespect for persons. Besides which, when sitting on the carpet of justice,\nhe did not, as some Kotwals do, use rough or angry language to those who\ncannot reply; nor did he take offence when none was intended.\n\nAll the people of the city Chandrodaya, in the province of Malaya, on the\nwestern coast of Bharatland, loved and esteemed this excellent magistrate;\nwhich did not, however, prevent thefts being committed so frequently and so\nregularly, that no one felt his property secure. At last the merchants who had\nsuffered most from these depredations went in a body before Gunshankar, and\nsaid to him:\n\n"O flower of the law! robbers have exercised great tyranny upon us, so great\nindeed that we can no longer stay in this city."\n\nThen the magistrate replied, "What has happened, has happened. But in future\nyou shall be free from annoyance. I will make due preparation for these\nthieves."\n\nThus saying Gunshankar called together his various delegates, and directed\nthem to increase the number of their people. He pointed out to them how they\nshould keep watch by night; besides which he ordered them to open registers of\nall arrivals and departures, to make themselves acquainted by means of spies\nwith the movements of every suspected person in the city, and to raise a body\nof paggis (trackers), who could follow the footprints of thieves even when\nthey wore thieving shoes,[96] till they came up with and arrested them. And\nlastly, he gave the patrols full power, whenever they might catch a robber in\nthe act, to slay him without asking questions.\n\nPeople in numbers began to mount guard throughout the city every night, but,\nnotwithstanding this, robberies continued to be committed. After a time all\nthe merchants having again met together went before the magistrate, and said,\n"O incarnation of justice! you have changed your officers, you have hired\nwatchmen, and you have established patrols: nevertheless the thieves have not\ndiminished, and plundering is ever taking place."\n\nThereupon Gunshankar carried them to the palace, and made them lay their\npetition at the feet of the king Randhir. That Raja, having consoled them,\nsent them home, saying, "Be ye of good cheer. I will to-night adopt a new\nplan, which, with the blessing of the Bhagwan, shall free ye from further\nanxiety."\n\nObserve, O Vikram, that Randhir was one of those concerning whom the poet\nsang--\n\nThe unwise run from one end to the other.\n\nNot content with becoming highly respectable, correct, and even unimpeachable\nin point of character, he reformed even his reformation, and he did much more\nthan he was required to do.\n\nWhen Canopus began to sparkle gaily in the southern skies, the king arose and\nprepared for a night\'s work. He disguised his face by smearing it with a\ncertain paint, by twirling his moustachios up to his eyes, by parting his\nbeard upon his chin, and conducting the two ends towards his ears, and by\ntightly tying a hair from a horse\'s tail over his nose, so as quite to change\nits shape. He then wrapped himself in a coarse outer garment, girt his loins,\nbuckled on his sword, drew his shield upon his arm, and without saying a word\nto those within the palace, he went out into the streets alone, and on foot.\n\nIt was dark, and Raja Randhir walked through the silent city for nearly an\nhour without meeting anyone. As, however, he passed through a back street in\nthe merchants\' quarter, he saw what appeared to be a homeless dog, lying at\nthe foot of a house-wall. He approached it, and up leaped a human figure,\nwhilst a loud voice cried, "Who art thou?"\n\nRandhir replied, "I am a thief; who art thou?"\n\n"And I also am a thief," rejoined the other, much pleased at hearing this;\n"come, then, and let us make together. But what art thou, a high-loper or a\nlully-prigger[97]?"\n\n"A little more ceremony between coves in the lorst,[98]" whispered the king,\nspeaking as a flash man, "were not out of place. But, look sharp, mind old\nOliver,[99] or the lamb-skin man[100] will have the pull of us, and as sure as\neggs is eggs we shall be scragged as soon as lagged.[101]"\n\n"Well, keep your red rag[102] quiet," grumbled the other, "and let us be\nworking."\n\nThen the pair, king and thief, began work in right earnest. The gang seemed to\nswarm in the street. They were drinking spirits, slaying victims, rubbing\ntheir bodies with oil, daubing their eyes with lamp-black, and repeating\nincantations to enable them to see in the darkness; others were practicing the\nlessons of the god with the golden spear,[103] and carrying out the four modes\nof breaching a house: 1. Picking out burnt bricks. 2.Cutting through unbaked\nones when old, when softened by recent damp, by exposure to the sun, or by\nsaline exudations. 3. Throwing water on a mud wall; and 4. Boring through one\nof wood. The sons of Skanda were making breaches in the shape of lotus\nblossoms, the sun, the new moon, the lake, and the water jar, and they seemed\nto be anointed with magic unguents, so that no eye could behold, no weapon\nharm them.\n\nAt length having filled his bag with costly plunder, the thief said to the\nking, "Now, my rummy cove, we\'ll be off to the flash ken, where the lads and\nthe morts are waiting to wet their whistles."\n\nRandhir, who as a king was perfectly familiar with "thieves\' Latin," took\nheart, and resolved to hunt out the secrets of the den. On the way, his\ncompanion, perfectly satisfied with the importance which the new cove had\nattached to a rat-hole,[104] and convinced that he was a true robber, taught\nhim the whistle, the word, and the sign peculiar to the gang, and promised him\nthat he should smack the lit[105] that night before "turning in."\n\nSo saying the thief rapped twice at the city gate, which was at once opened to\nhim, and preceding his accomplice led the way to a rock about two kos (four\nmiles) distant from the walls. Before entering the dark forest at the foot of\nthe eminence, the robber stood still for a moment and whistled twice through\nhis fingers with a shrill scream that rang through the silent glades. After a\nfew minutes the signal was answered by the hooting of an owl, which the robber\nacknowledged by shrieking like a jackal. Thereupon half a dozen armed men\narose from their crouching places in the grass, and one advanced towards the\nnew comers to receive the sign. It was given, and they both passed on, whilst\nthe guard sank, as it were, into the bowels of the earth. All these things\nRandhir carefully remarked: besides which he neglected not to take note of all\nthe distinguishable objects that lay on the road, and, when he entered the\nwood, he scratched with his dagger all the tree trunks within reach.\n\nAfter a sharp walk the pair reached a high perpendicular sheet of rock, rising\nabruptly from a clear space in the jungle, and profusely printed over with\nvermilion hands. The thief, having walked up to it, and made his obeisance,\nstooped to the ground, and removed a bunch of grass. The two then raised by\ntheir united efforts a heavy trap door, through which poured a stream of\nlight, whilst a confused hubbub of voices was heard below.\n\n"This is the ken," said the robber, preparing to descend a thin ladder of\nbamboo, "follow me!" And he disappeared with his bag of valuables.\n\nThe king did as he was bid, and the pair entered together a large hall, or\nrather a cave, which presented a singular spectacle. It was lighted up by\nlinks fixed to the sombre walls, which threw a smoky glare over the place, and\nthe contrast after the deep darkness reminded Randhir of his mother\'s\ndescriptions of Patal-puri, the infernal city. Carpets of every kind, from the\nchoicest tapestry to the coarsest rug, were spread upon the ground, and were\nstrewed with bags, wallets, weapons, heaps of booty, drinking cups, and all\nthe materials of debauchery.\n\nPassing through this cave the thief led Randhir into another, which was full\nof thieves, preparing for the pleasures of the night. Some were changing\ngarments, ragged and dirtied by creeping through gaps in the houses: others\nwere washing the blood from their hands and feet; these combed out their long\ndishevelled, dusty hair: those anointed their skins with perfumed cocoa-nut\noil. There were all manner of murderers present, a villanous collection of\nKartikeya\'s and Bhawani\'s[106] crew. There were stabbers with their poniards\nhung to lanyards lashed round their naked waists, Dhaturiya- poisoners[107]\ndistinguished by the little bag slung under the left arm, and Phansigars[108]\nwearing their fatal kerchiefs round their necks. And Randhir had reason to\nthank the good deed in the last life that had sent him there in such strict\ndisguise, for amongst the robbers he found, as might be expected, a number of\nhis own people, spies and watchmen, guards and patrols.\n\nThe thief, whose importance of manner now showed him to be the chief of the\ngang, was greeted with applause as he entered the robing room, and he bade all\nmake salam to the new companion. A number of questions concerning the success\nof the night\'s work was quickly put and answered: then the company, having got\nready for the revel, flocked into the first cave. There they sat down each in\nhis own place, and began to eat and drink and make merry.\n\nAfter some hours the flaring torches began to burn out, and drowsiness to\noverpower the strongest heads. Most of the robbers rolled themselves up in the\nrugs, and covering their heads, went to sleep. A few still sat with their\nbacks to the wall, nodding drowsily or leaning on one side, and too stupefied\nwith opium and hemp to make any exertion.\n\nAt that moment a servant woman, whom the king saw for the first time, came\ninto the cave, and looking at him exclaimed, "O Raja! how came you with these\nwicked men? Do you run away as fast as you can, or they will surely kill you\nwhen they awake."\n\n"I do not know the way; in which direction am I to go?" asked Randhir.\n\nThe woman then showed him the road. He threaded the confused mass of snorers,\ntreading with the foot of a tiger-cat, found the ladder, raised the trap-door\nby exerting all his strength, and breathed once more the open air of heaven.\nAnd before plunging into the depths of the wood he again marked the place\nwhere the entrance lay and carefully replaced the bunch of grass.\n\nHardly had Raja Randhir returned to the palace, and removed the traces of his\nnight\'s occupation, when he received a second deputation of the merchants,\ncomplaining bitterly and with the longest faces about their fresh misfortunes.\n\n"O pearl of equity!" said the men of money, "but yesterday you consoled us\nwith the promise of some contrivance by the blessing of which our houses and\ncoffers would be safe from theft; whereas our goods have never yet suffered so\nseverely as during the last twelve hours."\n\nAgain Randhir dismissed them, swearing that this time he would either die or\ndestroy the wretches who had been guilty of such violence.\n\nThen having mentally prepared his measures, the Raja warned a company of\narchers to hold themselves in readiness for secret service, and as each one of\nhis own people returned from the robbers\' cave he had him privily arrested and\nput to death--because the deceased, it is said, do not, like Baitals, tell\ntales. About nightfall, when he thought that the thieves, having finished\ntheir work of plunder, would meet together as usual for wassail and\ndebauchery, he armed himself, marched out his men, and led them to the rock in\nthe jungle.\n\nBut the robbers, aroused by the disappearance of the new companion, had made\nenquiries and had gained intelligence of the impending danger. They feared to\nflee during the daytime, lest being tracked they should be discovered and\ndestroyed in detail. When night came they hesitated to disperse, from the\ncertainty that they would be captured in the morning. Then their captain, who\nthroughout had been of one opinion, proposed to them that they should resist,\nand promised them success if they would hear his words. The gang respected\nhim, for he was known to be brave: they all listened to his advice, and they\npromised to be obedient.\n\nAs young night began to cast transparent shade upon the jungle ground, the\nchief of the thieves mustered his men, inspected their bows and arrows, gave\nthem encouraging words, and led them forth from the cave. Having placed them\nin ambush he climbed the rock to espy the movements of the enemy, whilst\nothers applied their noses and ears to the level ground. Presently the moon\nshone full upon Randhir and his band of archers, who were advancing quickly\nand carelessly, for they expected to catch the robbers in their cave. The\ncaptain allowed them to march nearly through the line of ambush. Then he gave\nthe signal, and at that moment the thieves, rising suddenly from the bush fell\nupon the royal troops and drove them back in confusion.\n\nThe king also fled, when the chief of the robbers shouted out, "Hola! thou a\nRajput and running away from combat?" Randhir hearing this halted, and the\ntwo, confronting each other, bared their blades and began to do battle with\nprodigious fury.\n\nThe king was cunning of fence, and so was the thief. They opened the duel, as\nskilful swordsmen should, by bending almost double, skipping in a circle, each\nkeeping his eye well fixed upon the other, with frowning brows and\ncontemptuous lips; at the same time executing divers gambados and measured\nleaps, springing forward like frogs and backward like monkeys, and beating\ntime with their sabres upon their shields, which rattled like drums.\n\nThen Randhir suddenly facing his antagonist, cut at his legs with a loud cry,\nbut the thief sprang in the air, and the blade whistled harmlessly under him.\nNext moment the robber chief\'s sword, thrice whirled round his head, descended\nlike lightning in a slanting direction towards the king\'s left shoulder: the\nlatter, however, received it upon his target and escaped all hurt, though he\nstaggered with the violence of the blow.\n\nAnd thus they continued attacking each other, parrying and replying, till\ntheir breath failed them and their hands and wrists were numbed and cramped\nwith fatigue. They were so well matched in courage, strength, and address,\nthat neither obtained the least advantage, till the robber\'s right foot\ncatching a stone slid from under him, and thus he fell to the ground at the\nmercy of his enemy. The thieves fled, and the Raja, himself on his prize, tied\nhis hands behind him, and brought him back to the city at the point of his\ngood sword.\n\nThe next morning Randhir visited his prisoner, whom he caused to be bathed,\nand washed, and covered with fine clothes. He then had him mounted on a camel\nand sent him on a circuit of the city, accompanied by a crier proclaiming\naloud: "Who hears! who hears! who hears! the king commands! This is the thief\nwho has robbed and plundered the city of Chandrodaya. Let all men therefore\nassemble themselves together this evening in the open space outside the gate\nleading towards the sea. And let them behold the penalty of evil deeds, and\nlearn to be wise."\n\nRandhir had condemned the thief to be crucified,[109] nailed and tied with his\nhands and feet stretched out at full length, in an erect posture until death;\neverything he wished to eat was ordered to him in order to prolong life and\nmisery. And when death should draw near, melted gold was to be poured down his\nthroat till it should burst from his neck and other parts of his body.\n\nIn the evening the thief was led out for execution, and by chance the\nprocession passed close to the house of a wealthy landowner. He had a\nfavourite daughter named Shobhani, who was in the flower of her youth and very\nlovely; every day she improved, and every moment added to her grace and\nbeauty. The girl had been carefully kept out of sight of mankind, never being\nallowed outside the high walls of the garden, because her nurse, a wise woman\nmuch trusted in the neighbourhood, had at the hour of death given a solemn\nwarning to her parents. The prediction was that the maiden should be the\nadmiration of the city, and should die a Sati- widow[110] before becoming a\nwife. From that hour Shobhani was kept as a pearl in its casket by her father,\nwho had vowed never to survive her, and had even fixed upon the place and\nstyle of his suicide.\n\nBut the shaft of Fate[111] strikes down the vulture sailing above the clouds,\nand follows the worm into the bowels of the earth, and pierces the fish at the\nbottom of the ocean--how then can mortal man expect to escape it? As the\nrobber chief, mounted upon the camel, was passing to the cross under the old\nhouseholder\'s windows, a fire breaking out in the women\'s apartments, drove\nthe inmates into the rooms looking upon the street.\n\nThe hum of many voices arose from the solid pavement of heads: "This is the\nthief who has been robbing the whole city; let him tremble now, for Randhir\nwill surely crucify him!"\n\nIn beauty and bravery of bearing, as in strength and courage, no man in\nChandrodaya surpassed the robber, who, being magnificently dressed, looked,\ndespite his disgraceful cavalcade, like the son of a king. He sat with an\nunmoved countenance, hardly hearing in his pride the scoffs of the mob; calm\nand steady when the whole city was frenzied with anxiety because of him. But\nas he heard the word "tremble" his lips quivered, his eyes flashed fire, and\ndeep lines gathered between his eyebrows.\n\nShobhani started with a scream from the casement behind which she had hid\nherself, gazing with an intense womanly curiosity into the thoroughfare. The\nrobber\'s face was upon a level with, and not half a dozen feet from, her pale\ncheeks. She marked his handsome features, and his look of wrath made her\nquiver as if it had been a flash of lightning. Then she broke away from the\nfascination of his youth and beauty, and ran breathless to her father, saying:\n\n"Go this moment and get that thief released!\n\n"The old housekeeper replied: "That thief has been pilfering and plundering\nthe whole city, and by his means the king\'s archers were defeated; why, then,\nat my request, should our most gracious Raja Randhir release him?"\n\nShobhani, almost beside herself, exclaimed: "If by giving up your whole\nproperty, you can induce the Raja to release him, then instantly so do; if he\ndoes not come to me, I must give up my life!"\n\nThe maiden then covered her head with her veil, and sat down in the deepest\ndespair, whilst her father, hearing her words, burst into a cry of grief, and\nhastened to present himself before the Raja. He cried out:\n\n"O great king, be pleased to receive four lakhs of rupees, and to release this\nthief."\n\nBut the king replied: "He has been robbing the whole city, and by reason of\nhim my guards have been destroyed. I cannot by any means release him."\n\nThen the old householder finding, as he had expected the Raja inexorable, and\nnot to be moved, either by tears or bribes, or by the cruel fate of the girl,\nreturned home with fire in his heart, and addressed her:\n\n"Daughter, I have said and done all that is possible but it avails me nought\nwith the king. Now, then, we die."\n\nIn the mean time, the guards having led the thief all round the city, took him\noutside the gates, and made him stand near the cross. Then the messengers of\ndeath arrived from the palace, and the executioners began to nail his limbs.\nHe bore the agony with the fortitude of the brave; but when he heard what had\nbeen done by the old householder\'s daughter, he raised his voice and wept\nbitterly, as though his heart had been bursting, and almost with the same\nbreath he laughed heartily as at a feast. All were startled by his merriment;\ncoming as it did at a time when the iron was piercing his flesh, no man could\nsee any reason for it.\n\nWhen he died, Shobhani, who was married to him in the spirit, recited to\nherself these sayings:\n\n"There are thirty-five millions of hairs on the human body. The woman who\nascends the pile with her husband will remain so many years in heaven. As the\nsnake-catcher draws the serpent from his hole, so she, rescuing her husband\nfrom hell, rejoices with him; aye, though he may have sunk to a region of\ntorment, be restrained in dreadful bonds, have reached the place of anguish,\nbe exhausted of strength, and afflicted and tortured for his crimes. No other\neffectual duty is known for virtuous women at any time after the death of\ntheir lords, except casting themselves into the same fire. As long as a woman\nin her successive transmigrations, shall decline burning herself, like a\nfaithful wife, in the same fire with her deceased lord, so long shall she not\nbe exempted from springing again to life in the body of some female animal."\n\nTherefore the beautiful Shobhani, virgin and wife, resolved to burn herself,\nand to make the next life of the thief certain. She showed her courage by\nthrusting her finger into a torch flame till it became a cinder, and she\nsolemnly bathed in the nearest stream.\n\nA hole was dug in the ground, and upon a bed of green tree-trunks were heaped\nhemp, pitch, faggots, and clarified butter, to form the funeral pyre. The dead\nbody, anointed, bathed, and dressed in new clothes, was then laid upon the\nheap, which was some two feet high. Shobhani prayed that as long as fourteen\nIndras reign, or as many years as there are hairs in her head, she might abide\nin heaven with her husband, and be waited upon by the heavenly dancers. She\nthen presented her ornaments and little gifts of corn to her friends, tied\nsome cotton round both wrists, put two new combs in her hair, painted her\nforehead, and tied up in the end of her body-cloth clean parched rice[112] and\ncowrie-shells. These she gave to the bystanders, as she walked seven times\nround the funeral pyre, upon which lay the body. She then ascended the heap of\nwood, sat down upon it, and taking the thief\'s head in her lap, without cords\nor levers or upper layer or faggots, she ordered the pile to be lighted. The\ncrowd standing around set fire to it in several places, drummed their drums,\nblew their conchs, and raised a loud cry of "Hari bol! Hari bol! [113]" Straw\nwas thrown on, and pitch and clarified butter were freely poured out. But\nShobhani\'s was a Sahamaran, a blessed easy death: no part of her body was seen\nto move after the pyre was lighted--in fact, she seemed to die before the\nflame touched her.\n\nBy the blessing of his daughter\'s decease, the old householder beheaded\nhimself.[114] He caused an instrument to be made in the shape of a half-moon\nwith an edge like a razor, and fitting the back of his neck. At both ends of\nit, as at the beam of a balance, chains were fastened. He sat down with eyes\nclosed; he was rubbed with the purifying clay of the holy river,\nVaiturani[115]; and he repeated the proper incantations. Then placing his feet\nupon the extremities of the chains, he suddenly jerked up his neck, and his\nsevered head rolled from his body upon the ground. What a happy death was\nthis!\n\nThe Baital was silent, as if meditating on the fortunate transmigration which\nthe old householder had thus secured.\n\n"But what could the thief have been laughing at, sire?" asked the young prince\nDharma Dhwaj of his father.\n\n"At the prodigious folly of the girl, my son," replied the warrior king,\nthoughtlessly.\n\n"I am indebted once more to your majesty," burst out the Baital, "for\nreleasing me from this unpleasant position, but the Raja\'s penetration is\nagain at fault. Not to leave your royal son and heir labouring under a false\nimpression, before going I will explain why the brave thief burst into tears,\nand why he laughed at such a moment.\n\n"He wept when he reflected that he could not requite her kindness in being\nwilling to give up everything she had in the world to save his life; and this\nthought deeply grieved him.\n\nThen it struck him as being passing strange that she had begun to love him\nwhen the last sand of his life was well nigh run out; that wondrous are the\nways of the revolving heavens which bestow wealth upon the niggard that cannot\nuse it, wisdom upon the bad man who will misuse it, a beautiful wife upon the\nfool who cannot protect her, and fertilizing showers upon the stony hills. And\nthinking over these things, the gallant and beautiful thief laughed aloud.\n\n"Before returning to my sires-tree," continued the Vampire, "as I am about to\ndo in virtue of your majesty\'s unintelligent reply, I may remark that men may\nlaugh and cry, or may cry and laugh, about everything in this world, from\ntheir neighbours\' deaths, which, as a general rule, in no wise concern them,\nto their own latter ends, which do concern them exceedingly. For my part, I am\nin the habit of laughing at everything, because it animates the brain,\nstimulates the lungs, beautifies the countenance, and--for the moment, good-\nbye, Raja Vikram!\n\nThe warrior king, being forewarned this time, shifted the bundle containing\nthe Baital from his back to under his arm, where he pressed it with all his\nmight.\n\nThis proceeding, however, did not prevent the Vampire from slipping back to\nhis tree, and leaving an empty cloth with the Raja.\n\nPresently the demon was trussed up as usual; a voice sounded behind Vikram,\nand the loquacious thing again began to talk.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vampire\'s Sixth Story.
