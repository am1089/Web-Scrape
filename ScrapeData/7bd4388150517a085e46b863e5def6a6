It having been quieted 2, he says (to the slaughterer), 'Pull\nout the omentum!' The omentum having been pulled out 2, let him tell (the\nslaughterer) to search groping for an embryo. If they do not find one, why\nneed they care? and if they find one, atonement is made therefore.\n\n4:5:2:22\\. For surely it is not right that, thinking it to be one (cow), they\nshould perform, as it were, with that one; or that, thinking them to be two,\nthey should perform, as it were, with two 3. Let him bid (the\n\np. 392\n\nslaughterer) get ready the pot (sthali) and the cloth (ush _n_ isha) 1.\n\n4:5:2:33\\. They then perform with the omentum, just as its mode of performance\nis 2. Having performed with the omentum, both the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer\nreturn (to the sacrificial ground). The Adhvaryu says, 'Pull out that embryo!'\notherwise he would not pull it out from the womb, since it is only pulled out\nfrom the womb of a sick or dead (female); but when the embryo is full grown,\nthen indeed it comes out through birth: let him bid him pull it out even after\ntearing asunder the thighs.\n\n4:5:2:44\\. When it is pulled out, he addresses it with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 28),\n'May the embryo of ten months move together with the caul!'--by saying, 'May\nit move,' he puts breath into it; and 'of ten months' he says, because when an\nembryo is full grown, then it is one of ten months: thus, even though it is\nnot ten months old, he makes it one of ten months by means of the Brahman\n(prayer), the Ya _g_ us.\n\n4:5:2:55\\. 'Together with the caul'--this he says so that, like a ten months'\n(calf), it may go out with the caul 3,--'As yonder wind moveth, as the ocean\nmoveth;'--thereby he puts breath into it;--'So hath this ten months' (calf)\nslipped out with the caul;'--this he means to say so that, like a ten months'\ncalf, it may slip out with the caul.\n\n4:5:2:66\\. Here now they say, 'What is he to do with\n\np. 393\n\nthat embryo?'--They might cut off a portion from every limb, even as (is done)\nthe portioning of other portions. But let him not do so; for that (embryo)\nsurely has its limbs undeveloped. Having cut it below the neck, they should\nlet that fat juice drip into the pot; for that same juice drips from all its\nlimbs, and thus it is a portion cut out from all its limbs. He then cuts the\nsacrificial portions of the cow in the same way in which they are (usually)\nportioned off.\n\n4:5:2:77\\. They cook them on the cooking-fire of the animal offering: at the\nsame time 1 they cook that fat juice. Having wrapped the embryo in the cloth,\nhe lays it down by the side of the cooking-fire. When it (the victim) is\ncooked, he puts together 2 the (flesh) portions and bastes only them, but not\nthat juice. They remove the victim (from the fire); and at the same time they\nremove that juice.\n\n4:5:2:88\\. They take it along the back of the pit, between the sacrificial\nstake and the fire. It having been put down south (of the fire), the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ cuts off the sacrificial portions. He then makes an under-\nlayer (of ghee) in both offering-spoons, and addresses (the Hot _ri_ ) for the\nrecitation to the Manota deity on the havis. Thereupon they make cuttings from\nthe portions of the cow, in the same way in which cuttings are made from them\n3.\n\n4:5:2:99\\. Now there is an offering-spoon called pra _k_ ara _n_ i\n\np. 394\n\ntherein the Pratiprasthat _ri_ makes an underlayer of ghee for the fat juice,\ntakes two portions (from the juice), bastes them once (with ghee), and\nreplenishes (the juice whence) both portions (have been taken). He (the\nAdhvaryu) then addresses (the Hot _ri_ ) for. the recitation (of the\ninvitatory prayer). Having called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says (to the\nMaitravaru _n_ a), 'Prompt (the Hot _ri_ to recite the offering prayer)!' As\nthe Vasha _t_ is uttered, the Adhvaryu offers (the flesh portions). After the\nAdhvaryu's oblation the Pratiprasthat _ri_ offers (the fat juice)--\n\n4:5:2:1010\\. With (Va _g_. S. VIII, 29), 'Thou whose fruit is fit for\nsacrifice,'--for embryos are unfit for sacrifice: this one he thus makes fit\nfor sacrifice by means of the Brahman, the Ya _g_ us;--'thou who hast a golden\nwomb,'--for on that former occasion 1, they rend the womb when they tear out\n(the embryo); and gold means immortal life; he thus makes that womb of her\n(the cow) immortal;--'Him whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought together\nwith his mother, Hail!' Thus, if it be a male (embryo); but if it be a female\none, with, 'Her whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought together with her\nmother, Hail!' And, if it be an indistinguishable embryo, let him offer in\nmaking it male, since embryos (garbha, masc.) are male, 'Him whose limbs are\nunbroken, I have brought together with his mother, Hail!' For on that former\noccasion, when they tear out (the embryo) they separate it from its mother:\nnow, having rendered it successful by means of the Brahman, the Ya _g_ us, he\nbrings it again together with its mother in the midst of the sacrifice.\n\np. 395\n\n4:5:2:1111\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu makes the oblation to the Lord of the\nforest 1. Having made the oblation to the Lord of the forest, the Adhvaryu,\nwhile pouring together the sacrificial portions that are for the upabh _ri_\n_t_ , says (to the Hot _ri_ ), 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish _t_\nak _ri_ t!' The Pratiprasthat _ri_ comes and takes all that fat juice, and\npours twice (ghee) thereon. Having called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , the\nAdhvaryu says, 'Prompt!' and offers as the Vasha _t_ is uttered. After the\nAdhvaryu's oblation the Pratiprasthat _ri_ offers,\n\n4:5:2:1212\\. With (Va _g_. S. VIII, 30), 'The bountiful multiform juice 2,'--\nby 'bountiful' he means to say (the bestower) 'of numerous gifts;' and 'the\nmultiform' he says, because embryos are, as it were, multiform,--'The strong\njuice hath invested itself with greatness:'--for it (the embryo) is indeed\ninvested 3 in the mother.--'May the worlds spread along her, the one-footed,\ntwo-footed, three-footed, four-footed, eight-footed,'\\--'Hail!' He thereby\nmagnifies her (the cow): far more, forsooth, does he gain by offering an\neight-footed one, than by one not eight-footed.\n\n4:5:2:1313\\. Here now they say, 'What is he to do with that embryo 4?' They\nmay expose it on a tree; for\n\np. 396\n\nembryos have the air for their support, and the tree is, as it were, the same\nas the air: thus he establishes it on its own support. But, say they, if, in\nthat case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'They shall expose him 1 dead on\na tree,' then verily it would be so.\n\n4:5:2:1414\\. They may throw it into the water, for water is the support of\neverything here: he thus establishes it in the water. But, say they, if, in\nthat case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'He shall die in water!' then\nverily it would be so.\n\n4:5:2:1515\\. They may bury it ins a mole-hill; for this (earth) is the support\nof everything here: he thus establishes it on this same (earth). But, say\nthey, if, in that case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'They shall quickly\nprepare a burying-place for him, being dead!' then verily it would be so.\n\n4:5:2:1616\\. He may offer it to the Maruts on the cooking-fire of the animal\nsacrifice; for the Maruts, the clans (common people) of the gods, are not\noblation-eaters (ahuta-ad) 2, and the uncooked embryo, as it were, is no\noblation (ahuta); and the animal cooking-fire is taken from the \xc3\x82havaniya:\nthus indeed it (the embryo) is\n\np. 397\n\nnot excluded from the sacrifice, and yet is not (offered) directly in the\n\xc3\x82havaniya (offering-fire). And the Maruts are of the gods: he thus establishes\nit with the Maruts 1.\n\n4:5:2:1717\\. As soon as he has performed the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us offerings,\nwhen the coals are only just extinguished, he takes that embryo with the\ncloth, and standing with his face to the east, he offers it with a verse to\nthe Maruts (Va _g_. S. VIII, 31; Rig-veda I. 86, 1),--'Verily, O Maruts, in\nwhosesoever house ye drink, the heroes of the sky, he is the best protected\nman.' He utters no Svaha (hail), for the Maruts, the clans of the gods are no\noblation-eaters, and no oblation, as it were, is what is offered without\nSvaha. And the Maruts are of the gods: he thus establishes it with the Maruts.\n\n4:5:2:1818\\. He then covers it over with the coals with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 32;\nRig-veda I, 22, 13), 'The great Heaven and Earth may mix this our sacrifice,\nand fill us with nourishments!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[391:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_914) The order of this and the succeeding Brahma _n_ as\ndiffers considerably in the two recensions. In the Ka _n_ va recension the\npresent Brahma _n_ a (the text of which also differs very much) is preceded by\nthree others (V, 6, 1-3), corresponding to M. IV, 5, 3; IV, 5, 4 and IV, 5, 6,\nrespectively.\n\n[391:2](sbe2661.htm#fr_916) The text has simply, he (viz. the Samit _ri_ or\nbutcher) having quieted it, he (the Adhvaryu) says, ( _S_.) having pulled it\nout, let him (A.) bid. . . .\n\n[391:3](sbe2661.htm#fr_917) The meaning of this would seem to be, that they\nshould not content themselves with the supposition of its being a barren cow,\nbut that they should ascertain whether she is not--as the term is--'ash _t_\napadi,' or eight-footed, i.e. a cow with calf (cf. [par.\n12](sbe2661.htm#4:5:2:12)), and should in that case make atonement. The Ka _n_\nva text reads, Now when they thus proceed with that (animal offering), they,\nthinking it to be one (cow) only, pronounce the apri verses (apri _n_ anti).\nThey turn out to be two (te dve bhavata _h_ ); and surely it is not right that\none should cast away that on which the apri verses have been pronounced. Now\nthat juice has flowed together from all the limbs: thus offering is also made\nwith those sacrificial portions of that (embryo). And the sacrifice is as much\nas the havis and Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t: he thus connects that whole (embryo)\nwith that sacrifice, p. 391 and thus that which is superfluous (atirikta)\nbecomes not superfluous.\n\n[392:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_918) The comm. on Katy. XXV, 10, 7, describes the ush\n_n_ isha, used on this occasion, as a small cloth, or kerchief.\n\n[392:2](sbe2661.htm#fr_919) See [III, 8, 2, 16](sbe2632.htm#3:8:2:16) seq.\n\n[392:3](sbe2661.htm#fr_920) Or, even as a ten months' calf moves with the\ncaul, so he means to say (that) this (should take place).\n\n[393:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_921) Or, in the same place. The Ka _n_ va text reads,\nHaving cut off the head, and let the juice (rasa) flow out, he cooks it by the\nside of (prative _s_ am) the (flesh) portions. And when they proceed with the\nhavis, then having made an underlayer of ghee, and, taking twice from that\njuice, having basted (the portions therewith), he replenishes the (places of\nthe) two portions.\n\n[393:2](sbe2661.htm#fr_922) ? Read 'samuhya' for 'samudya.' See [III, 8, 3,\n5](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:5) seq.\n\n[393:3](sbe2661.htm#fr_923) See [III, 8, 3, 15](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:15) seq.\n\n[394:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_924) See [par. 3](sbe2661.htm#4:5:2:3).\n\n[395:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_925) See [III, 8, 3, 33](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:33).\n\n[395:2](sbe2661.htm#fr_926) Indu, lit. 'droop,' a term usually applied to the\ndraughts of Soma, a connection with which doubtless is here intended.\n\n[395:3](sbe2661.htm#fr_927) A different simile is implied in the original\n'antar mahimanam ana _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a.'\n\n[395:4](sbe2661.htm#fr_928) The Ka _n_ va text is much briefer here: He then\nties up the head ( _s_ ira _h_ pratinahya, ? with the body) either with a\ncloth (ush _n_ isha), or with bast (vakala), and having pushed asunder the\ncooking-fire of the animal offering, he lays it above them, with 'Verily, O\nMaruts . . .,' for the common people are eaters of raw flesh, and the Maruts\np. 396 are the people: he thus establishes it with the Maruts. Or (uto) with a\nverse to Heaven and Earth, 'The great Heaven and Earth . . .,' for additional\nsuperfluous (atirikta) is that (garbha), beyond these two, heaven and earth,\nnothing whatever remains (or, nothing surpasses them, atiri _k_ yata): thus he\nestablishes it within those two, heaven and earth; and while being\nsuperfluous, it comes to be no longer superfluous (or redundant).\n\n[396:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_929) 'Enam' apparently refers both to the sacrificer\nand to the embryo (garbha, masc.).\n\n[396:2](sbe2661.htm#fr_930) For the common people are eaters of raw flesh\n(amad), and the Maruts are the people. Ka _n_ va text. Neither a Kshatriya nor\na Vai _s_ ya can eat remains of offerings, but only a Brahman is hutad, Ait.\nBr. VII, 19.\n\n[397:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_931) One might expect 'deveshu:' thus he establishes it\nwith the gods; unless it is intended as the final decision: 'hence he consigns\nit to the Maruts.' The wording is, however, the same as in the preceding\nparagraphs.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 5, 3. Third Brahma _n_ a](sbe2662.htm)\n\n"
