Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! I see that at the command of the King, the\nministers installed Haris\xc2\x92chandra on the royal throne; but how Tris\xc2\x92anku got\nrid of his Cha _nd_ ala body, kindly say. Was it that he bathed in the holy\nwaters of the Ganges and lived in the forest and when he died he was freed of\nthe curse; or was it that the Guru Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha favoured him by his grace and\nfreed him of the curse? O best of Ri _s_ is! I am extremely eager to hear the\nlife of the King; therefore kindly describe to me in detail his wonderful\ncareer.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n4-16. Vyasa said :-- O King! The King became gladdened in his heart to install\nhis son on the throne and began to pass his days in that forest in the\nmeditation of Bhagavati Bhavani. Thus some time passed when Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, the\nson of Kaus\xc2\x92ika, completing his course of Tapasya with an intent mind returned\nto his home to see his wife and sons. On coming back to his house, the\nintelligent Muni found his sons and other members of the family happy and well\nconditioned, became very glad and when his wife came to him for his service,\nasked her :-- O Fair-eyed One! How did you spend your time in days of famine?\nThere was nothing whatsoever of the stock of rice, etc., in the house; how\nthen did you nourish these boys? Please speak to me. O Fair One! I was very\nbusy with my austerities, I could not therefore come to you and see my boys;\nhow then, O Beloved, and what measures did you resort to for their\nmaintenance? O good and auspicious One! When I heard of the dire famine, I\nthought then \xc2\x93I have no wealth; so what shall I do if I go there?\xc2\x94 Thus\nthinking I did not come then. O Beautiful One! At that time, one day I was\nvery hungry and being very much\n\n\n\np. 637\n\n\n\ntired I entered into the house of a Cha _nd_ ala, with the object of stealing.\nOn entering the house I found the Cha _nd_ ala sleeping; then being extremely\ndistressed with hunger, I entered into his kitchen if I could find anything\nthere. When the dishes were sought and turned, and when I was going to take\ncooked dog\xc2\x92s flesh I immediately fell into the sight of that Cha _nd_ ala. He\nasked me very affectionately \xc2\x93Who are you? Why have you entered here at this\nhour of night? Why are your looking after the dishes? Speak what you want.\xc2\x94 O\nBeautiful One! When the Cha _nd_ ala asked me these questions, I was very much\npressed by hunger and I spoke out my wants in a tremulous voice :-- O\nFortunate One! I am an ascetic Brahmi _n_ very much pained by hunger; I have\nentered your house stealthily and am looking out for some eatables from your\ncooking pots. O Intelligent One! I am now your guest in the form of a thief; I\nam now specially very hungry; so I will now eat your cooked meat; kindly\npermit me. Hearing these words, the Cha _nd_ ala spoke to me in words\nauthorised by the S\xc2\x92astras :-- O One of the Superior Var _n_ a! Know this to\nbe the house of a Cha _nd_ ala; so never eat that flesh.\n\n\n\n17-28. The human birth is very rare in this world; then again to be born a\nDvija is more difficult; and to get Brahma _n_ hood again in the Dvijas is\nexceedingly difficult. Are you not aware of this? They ought never to eat the\ndefiled food who desire to attain to the Heavens; owing to Karma, the Mahar\n_s_ i Manu has denominated the seventh caste as Antyaja and has discarded them\naltogether. So, O Brahmi _n_! I am now by my actions turned into a Cha _nd_\nala and so forsaken by all; there is no doubt in this. I am forbidding you so\nthat this fault of Var _n_ a S\xc2\x92a _n_ kara may not suddenly attack you.\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra said :-- \xc2\x93O Knower of Dharma! What you are speaking is quite true;\nthough a Cha _nd_ ala, your intelligence is very clear; hear, I will now speak\nto you the subtleties of the Dharma in times of danger. O Giver of respect!\nAlways and by all means it is advisable to keep up the body if sin be thereby\nincurred, one ought to perform Prayas\xc2\x92chitta (penance) for its purification\nwhen the time of danger is over. But if one commits sin when the time is not\none of danger, one gets degraded; not so in the time of danger. The man that\ndies out of hunger, goes to hell, no doubt. Therefore every man seeking for\nhis welfare must satisfy his hunger. Therefore I intend to steal for\npreserving my body. O Cha _nd_ ala See! The sin, incurred in stealing during\nfamine, which the Pundits have declared, goes to the God of rains until he\ndoes not pour forth rain.\xc2\x94 O Beloved! Just when I spoke these words, the God\nof Rains began to pour forth rain. O Beloved! Just when I spoke these words,\nthe God of Rains began to pour forth rain so desired by all, like that coming\nout of the elephant\xc2\x92s trunk. When\n\n\n\np. 638\n\n\n\nthe clouds thus poured forth rains with the glitterings of the lightnings, I\nfelt very glad and left the house of the Cha _nd_ ala. O Beautiful One! Now\nspeak out to me, how did you behave in that famine time, so terrible to all\nthe beings.\n\n\n\n29-48. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing the above words of the husband, the\nsweet speaking lady spoke :-- Hear, how I passed my time in times of famine. O\nMuni! After you had gone to practise Tapasya, the dire famine raged; and my\nsons, exhausted of hunger, became very anxious for food. I became very anxious\nto see the sons hungry; I then went out to the forest in quest of wild rice;\nand I got some fruits. Thus I spent some months by collecting the rice growing\nwildly in the forest; then in times these also could not be got and I became\nagain anxious. The Nibara rice, too, is now not available and nothing is\nobtained also by begging; there are no fruits on the trees and no roots are\nfound under the earth. The sons are crying in agony of hunger. What to do? And\nwhere to go? What am I to say now to the hungry boys? Oh God! Thus thinking on\nvarious ways, I at last came to this conclusion that I would sell one of my\nsons to a rich man and whatever price I can fetch, with that I will preserve\nthe lives of the other sons. O Dear! Thus thinking, I became ready and went\nout. O Fortunate One! Then this boy began to cry aloud and became very\ndistressed; yet I was so shameless that I took the crying boy and got out of\nmy \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama. At this time one Rajar _s_ i Satyavrata seeing me very distressed,\nasked me \xc2\x93O One of good vows! Why is this boy weeping?\xc2\x94 O Muni! I spoke to him\n\xc2\x93Today I am going to sell this boy.\xc2\x94 The King\xc2\x92s heart became overfilled with\npity, and spoke to me :-- \xc2\x93Take back to your \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama this boy. Daily I will\nsupply you with meat for the food of your boys until the Muni returns home.\xc2\x94 O\nMuni! The King from that time used to bring, with great pity, daily the flesh\nof deer and boar killed by him in the forest and he used to tie that on this\ntree. O Beloved! Thus I could protect my sons in that fearful ocean of crisis;\nbut that King was cursed by Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha only for my sake. One day that King\ndid not get any meat in the forest; so he slaughtered the Kama Dhenu (the cow\ngiving all desires) of Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha and the Muni became therefore very angry\nwith him. The high-souled Muni, angry on account of the killing of his cow,\ncalled the King by the name of Tris\xc2\x92anku and made him a Cha _nd_ ala. O\nKaus\xc2\x92ika! The prince turned into a Cha _nd_ ala because he came forward to do\ngood to me, so I am very sorry for his sake. So it is your urgent duty to save\nthe King from his terrible position by any means or by the influence of your\npowerful Tapasya.\n\n\n\np. 639\n\n\n\n49\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing these words from his wife the Muni\nKaus\xc2\x92ika consoled her and said :--\n\n\n\n50-55. O Lotus-eyed One! I will free the King of his curse, who saved you at\nthat critical moment; what more than this that I promise to you that I will\nremove his sufferings whether it be by my learning or it be by my Tapas. Thus\nconsoling his wife at that moment, Kaus\xc2\x92ika, the Knower of the Highest\nReality, began to think how he could destroy the pains and miseries of the\nKing. Thus thinking, the Muni went to the King Tris\xc2\x92anku, who was staying at\nthat time very humbly in a village of the Cha _nd_ alas, in the garb of a Cha\n_nd_ ala. Seeing the Muni coming, the King was greatly astonished and\ninstantly threw himself before his feet like a piece of stick. Kaus\xc2\x92ika raised\nthe fallen King and consoling him said :-- O King! You are cursed, on my\naccount, by the Muni Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha. I will, therefore, fulfil your desires.\nNow speak what I am to do.\n\n\n\n56-62. The King said :-- With a view to perform a sacrifice I prayed to Vas\xc2\x92i\n_st_ ha that I would perform a sacrifice, kindly do this for me. O Muni! Do\nthat sacrifice, by which I can go to the Heavens in this my present body.\xc2\x94\nVas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha became angry and said :-- \xc2\x93O Villain! How can you go and live in\nthe Heavens in this your human body?\xc2\x94 I was very anxious to go to the Svarga\n(Heaven)\n\nso I again spoke to him :-- \xc2\x93O Sinless One! I will then have the excellent\nsacrifice done by another priest.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha Deva cursed me,\nsaying \xc2\x93Be a Cha _nd_ ala.\xc2\x94 O Muni! Thus I have described to you all about my\ncurse. You are the one quite able to remove now my grievances. Distressed in\npain and agony, the King informed him and became quiet. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, too,\nthought how he could free him of his curse.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirteenth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the coming of\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra to Tris\xc2\x92anku in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 14](bk07ch14.htm)\n\n'
