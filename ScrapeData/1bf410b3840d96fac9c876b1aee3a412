And (the pradhana cannot be denoted by the word 'Self') because there is\nno statement of its having to be set aside.\n\nIf the pradhana which is the Not-Self were denoted by the term 'Being' (Sat),\nand if the passage 'That is the Self, that art thou, O _S_ vetaketu,' referred\nto the pradhana; the teacher whose wish it is to impart instruction about the\n\np. 58\n\ntrue Brahman would subsequently declare that the pradhana is to be set aside\n(and the true Brahman to be considered); for otherwise his pupil, having\nreceived the instruction about the pradhana, might take his stand on the\nlatter, looking upon it as the Non-Self. In ordinary life a man who wishes to\npoint out to a friend the (small) star Arundhati at first directs his\nattention to a big neighbouring star, saying 'that is Arundhati,' although it\nis really not so; and thereupon he withdraws his first statement and points\nout the real Arundhati. Analogously the teacher (if he intended to make his\npupil understand the Self through the Non-Self) would in the end definitely\nstate that the Self is not of the nature of the pradhana. But no such\nstatement is made; for the sixth Prapa _th_ aka arrives at a conclusion based\non the view that the Self is nothing but that which is (the Sat).\n\nThe word 'and' (in the Sutra) is meant to notify that the contradiction of a\nprevious statement (which would be implied in the rejected interpretation) is\nan additional reason for the rejection. Such a contradiction would result even\nif it were stated that the pradhana is to be set aside. For in the beginning\nof the Prapa _th_ aka it is intimated that through the knowledge of the cause\neverything becomes known. Compare the following consecutive sentences, 'Have\nyou ever asked for that instruction by which we hear what cannot be heard, by\nwhich we perceive what cannot be perceived, by which we know what cannot be\nknown? What is that instruction? As, my dear, by one clod of clay all that is\nmade of clay is known, the modification (i.e. the effect) being a name merely\nwhich has its origin in speech, while the truth is that it is clay merely,'\n&c. Now if the term 'Sat' denoted the pradhana, which is merely the cause of\nthe aggregate of the objects of enjoyment, its knowledge, whether to be set\naside or not to be set aside, could never lead to the knowledge of the\naggregate of enjoyers (souls), because the latter is not an effect of the\npradhana. Therefore the pradhana is not denoted by the term 'Sat.'--For this\nthe Sutrakara gives a further reason.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 9](sbe34015.htm)\n\n"
