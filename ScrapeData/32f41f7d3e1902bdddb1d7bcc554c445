The entering is as in the case of a lamp; for thus Scripture declares.\n\np. 765\n\nJust as a lamp, although abiding in one place only, enters through the light\nproceeding from it into connexion with many places; so the soul also, although\nlimited to one place, may through its light-like consciousness enter into\nseveral bodies. It may do this as well as in this life the soul, although\nabiding in one spot of the body only, viz. the heart, pervades the whole body\nby means of its consciousness and thus makes it its own. There is however the\nfollowing difference between the two cases. The non-released soul has its\nintellectual power contracted by the influence of Karman, and hence is\nincapable of that expansive pervasion without which it cannot identify itself\nwith other bodies. The released soul, on the other hand, whose intellectual\npower is non-contracted is capable of extending as far as it likes, and thus\nto make many bodies its own. For Scripture declares, 'That living soul is to\nbe known as part of the hundredth part of the point of a hair divided a\nhundred times, and yet it is capable of infinity' ( _S_ vet. Up. V, 9). The\nnon-released soul is ruled by Karman, the released one only by its will--this\nis the difference.--But, a new difficulty is raised, Scripture declares that\nwhen the soul reaches Brahman all its inner and outer knowledge is stopped:\n'Embraced by the highest Self the soul knows nothing that is without, nothing\nthat is within ' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 21). How then can it be said to know all\nthings?--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 16. It refers either to dreamless sleep or to union...](sbe48567.htm)\n\n"
