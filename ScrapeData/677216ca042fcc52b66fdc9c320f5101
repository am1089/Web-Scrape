Pra _g_ apati was desirous of going up to the world of heaven; but\nPra _g_ apati, indeed, is all the (sacrificial) animals 3\\--man, horse, bull,\nram, and\n\np. 300\n\nhe-goat:--by means of these forms he could not do so. He saw this bird-like\nbody, the fire-altar, and constructed it. He attempted to fly up, without\ncontracting and expanding (the wings), but could not do so. By contracting and\nexpanding (the wings) he did fly up: whence even to this day birds can only\nfly up when they contract their wings and spread their feathers.\n\n10:2:1:22\\. He measures it (the fire-altar) by finger-breadths; for the\nsacrifice being a man 1, it is by means of him that everything is measured\nhere. Now these, to wit, the fingers, are his lowest measure: he thus secures\nfor him (the sacrificial man 2) that lowest measure of his, and therewith he\nthus measures him.\n\n10:2:1:33\\. He measures by twenty-four finger-breadths 3,--the\n[Gayatri](errata.htm#4) (verse) consists of twenty-four syllables, and Agni is\nof Gayatra nature 4: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so\nmuch he thus measures him.\n\n10:2:1:44\\. He contracts 5 (the right wing) inside on both\n\np. 301\n\nsides 1 by just four finger-breadths, and expands 2 it outside on both sides 1\nby four finger-breadths: he thus expands it by just as much as he contracts\nit; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its proper size) nor does he make it\ntoo small. In the same way in regard to the tail, and in the same way in\nregard to the left wing.\n\n10:2:1:55\\. He then makes two bending-limbs 3 in the wings, for there are two\nbending-limbs in a bird's\n\np. 302\n\nwings. In one-third (of each wing he makes them), for the bending-limbs are in\none-third of the bird's wings;--in the inner third 1, for the bending-limbs\nare in the inner third of a bird's wings. He expands (each of these limbs) in\nfront 2 by just four finger-breadths, and contracts it behind by four finger-\nbreadths; he thus expands it by just as much as he contracts it; and thus,\nindeed, he neither exceeds (its size), nor does he make it too small.\n\n10:2:1:66\\. On that bending-limb he places one brick he thereby gives to it\nthat single tube (tubular organ) which joins on to 3 (the body) from the\nbending-limb of the flying bird. Then here (on the left wing).\n\n10:2:1:77\\. He then makes the wings crooked, for a bird's wings are crooked;\nhe expands them behind by just four finger-breadths, and contracts them in\nfront by four finger-breadths 4: he thus draws them out by\n\np. 303\n\njust as much as he draws them in; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its\nsize) nor does he make it too small.\n\n10:2:1:88\\. He now gives to it (the altar) the highest form 1. This Agni had\nnow been completely restored, and the gods conferred upon him this highest\nform; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) confer upon him this highest\nform: he makes a thousand bricks marked with straight lines, a thousand marked\nthis way (from left to right), and a thousand marked that way (from right to\nleft).\n\n10:2:1:99\\. And when he has laid down the fifth layer, he measures out the\naltar in three parts, and on the central part he places the one thousand\nbricks marked with straight lines: he thereby gives to it those straight\nplumes of the bird pointing backwards (with their tops, and covering it) from\nhead to tail.\n\n10:2:1:1010\\. On the right side he then lays down the one thousand (bricks)\nmarked _thus_ (from left to right): he thereby gives to it those curved plumes\non the right side of the bird 2.\n\n10:2:1:1111\\. On the left side he then lays down the one thousand (bricks)\nmarked _thus_ (from right to left): he thereby gives to it those curved plumes\non the left side of the bird. With a thousand (bricks he does it each time)--a\nthousand means everything:\n\np. 304\n\nwith everything (required) he thus confers that highest form upon him\n(Agni);--with three thousand--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as great\nas is his measure, with so much he thus confers the highest form upon him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[299:3](sbe4350.htm#fr_569) See VI, 2, 1, 15 seq.\n\n[300:1](sbe4350.htm#fr_570) The sacrifice, being the substitute of (the\nsacrificing) man, is represented as identical with the Sacrificer, its\nmeasurements being taken from his body and stature; see part i, p. 78. note 1.\n\n[300:2](sbe4350.htm#fr_571) Or,--for it, viz. the fire-altar, representing\nboth Agni-Pra _g_ apati and the Sacrificer: hence this assumed identity has to\nbe borne in mind to understand the symbolic speculations of the Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[300:3](sbe4350.htm#fr_572) This measure (24 a\xe1\xb9\x85guli) is equal to one 'aratni'\nor cubit; 12 a\xe1\xb9\x85guli being equal to a 'vitasti' or span (of thumb and little\nfinger, or from wrist to tip of middle finger).\n\n[300:4](sbe4350.htm#fr_573) See VI, 1, 1, 15; 1, 3, 29.\n\n[300:5](sbe4350.htm#fr_574) Or, he draws in, draws together (upasamuhati).\n\n[301:1](sbe4350.htm#fr_577) That is, on both sides of that part of the wing\nwhich joins the body of the altar he draws in by four finger-breadths the two\nlong sides of the wing, thus changing the parallelogram into a trapezium,\nwithout altering the superficial area of the wing. On the plan of the altar\ngiven in part ii, p. 419, the effect of this manipulation on the wings and\ntail is indicated by pointed lines.--Saya _n_ a remarks,--ubhayata _h_\npakshasya par _s_ vadvaye, antarata _h_ _k_ ityagner madhyade _s_ e _k_\natura\xe1\xb9\x85gulam upasamuhati sa _m_ karshati prave _s_ ayatity artha _h_ ; bahyata\n_h_ agnimadhyad bahyade _s_ e _k_ atura\xe1\xb9\x85gula _m_ vyuduhati, ante vivardhayati.\n\n[301:2](sbe4350.htm#fr_576) Or, he draws out, or draws asunder (vyuduhati).\n\n[301:3](sbe4350.htm#fr_578) Literally 'outbendings' (nir _n_\nama)--'Schwunggelenke' (spring-limbs), St. Petersb. Dict.--This 'bending-limb'\nwould seem to include the two inner segments of the (solid part of the) wing--\nthose corresponding to the upper and fore-arm of man--as well as the adjoining\nand connecting joints or articulations, which portions may be taken roughly as\nforming the inner third of the wing when covered with feathers. The 'bending-\nlimb' would thus derive its name from its 'bending,' or drawing, the wing\n'out' from the body. Saya _n_ a, however, explains it by 'nitara _m_ namati,'\n'that which bends down,' as if it were formed from the prep. 'ni,' instead of\n'nis.' The manipulation to which this part of the wing is to be subjected is,\nhowever, not quite easy to understand from the description, and the commentary\naffords very little assistance--vit _ri_ tiya iti pakshabhaga _m_ tredha vibha\n_g_ ya antare t _ri_ tiyabhage nirnamakara _n_ am . .; eta _m_ _s_ rutim\napekshyaivapastambenoktam, 'vakrapaksho vyastapu _k_ _kh_ o bhavati, pa _s_\n_k_ at pra\xe1\xb9\x85 (!) uduhati, purastat pratyuduhati, evam eva hi vayasam madhye\npakshanir _n_ amo bhavatiti vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ayate' iti.\n\n[302:1](sbe4350.htm#fr_579) That is, the third part of the wing adjoining the\nbody.\n\n[302:2](sbe4350.htm#fr_580) That is, at the front edge of the wing of the\nflying bird, that which cuts through the air. The joint between the second and\nthird segments of the wing, when expanded, would protrude, whilst on the\nopposite side of the wing the tops of the feathers would somewhat recede; but\nI am not sure whether this is what is referred to in these indications.\n\n[302:3](sbe4350.htm#fr_581) Literally, which lies beside, or close to (upa _s_\nete, viz. the body, as it would seem) from the bending-limb. The brick is\napparently meant to represent symbolically the bone of the upper segment, or\nsome tubular organ by which the vital air is supposed to enter the wing from\nthe body. Saya _n_ a remarks,--pakshipakshamadhyagatana _d_ itvena pra _s_ a\n_m_ sati, . . _k_ ityagne _h_ pakshamadhye eka _m_ na _d_ im eva nihitavan\nbhavati.\n\n[302:4](sbe4350.htm#fr_582) Comm.-- _k_ atura\xe1\xb9\x85gulamatra _m_ pa _s_ _k_ adbhage\nuduhati vikarshati, purastadbhage _k_ atura\xe1\xb9\x85gulamatra _m_ samuhati sa _m_\nkarshati; eva _m_ k _ri_ te vakratva _m_ bhavati. Cf. \xc3\x82pastamba's directions\nin note 3 of last page. I fail to see, however, in what respect this\nmanipulation differs from that referred to in paragraph 5; and whether the p.\n303 'vakratvam' refers to the irregular shape, or to the curved nature, of the\nwings.\n\n[303:1](sbe4350.htm#fr_583) That is, he gives to it the last finish.\n\n[303:2](sbe4350.htm#fr_584) Or, perhaps, those soft feathers of the bird\ncurved towards the right. Saya _n_ a as above--dakshi _n_ ata _h_ dakshi _n_\napakshe ityalikhita dakshi _n_ av _ri_ ta ish _t_ aka _h_ ; uttarata _h_\nuttarasmin pakshe ityalikhita _h_ savyav _ri_ ta ish _t_ aka upadadhyat.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 2, 2.
