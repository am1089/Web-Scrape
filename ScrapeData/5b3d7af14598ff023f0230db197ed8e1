Know, O son of Pa _nd_ u! that\nwhat is called renunciation is devotion; for nobody becomes a devotee who has\nnot renounced (all) fancies 4. To the sage who wishes to rise to devotion,\naction is said to be a means, and to him, when he has risen to devotion,\ntranquillity 5 is said to be a means. When one does not attach oneself to\nobjects of sense, nor to action, renouncing all fancies, then is one said to\nhave risen to devotion. (A man) should elevate his self by his self 6; he\nshould not debase his self, for even (a man\'s) own self is his\n\np. 68\n\nfriend, (a man\'s) own self is also his enemy 1. To him who has subjugated his\nself by his self 2, his self is a friend; but to him who has not restrained\nhis self, his own self behaves inimically, like an enemy. The self of one who\nhas subjugated his self and is tranquil, is absolutely concentrated (on\nitself), in the midst of cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as well as honour\nand dishonour. The devotee whose self is contented with knowledge and\nexperience 3, who is unmoved 4, who has restrained his senses, and to whom a\nsod, a stone, and gold are alike, is said to be devoted. And he is esteemed\nhighest, who thinks alike 5 about well-wishers, friends, and enemies, and\nthose who are indifferent, and those who take part with both sides, and those\nwho are objects of hatred, and relatives, as well as about the good and the\nsinful. A devotee should constantly devote his self to abstraction, remaining\nin a secret place 6, alone, with his mind and self 7 restrained, without\nexpectations, and without belongings. Fixing his seat firmly in a clean 8\nplace, not too high nor too low, and covered over with a sheet of cloth, a\ndeerskin, and (blades of) Ku _s_ a (grass),--and there seated on (that) seat,\nfixing his mind exclusively on one point, with the workings of the mind and\nsenses\n\np. 69\n\nrestrained, he should practice devotion for purity of self. Holding his body,\nhead, and neck even and unmoved, (remaining) steady, looking at the tip of his\nown nose 1, and not looking about in (all) directions, with a tranquil self,\ndevoid of fear, and adhering to the rules of Brahma _k_ arins 2, he should\nrestrain his mind, and (concentrate it) on me, and sit down engaged in\ndevotion, regarding me as his final goal. Thus constantly devoting his self to\nabstraction, a devotee whose mind is restrained, attains that tranquillity\nwhich culminates in final emancipation, and assimilation with me. Devotion is\nnot his, O Ar _g_ una! who eats too much, nor his who cats not at all; not his\nwho is addicted to too much sleep, nor his who is (ever) awake. That devotion\nwhich destroys (all) misery is his, who takes due food and exercise 3, who\ntoils duly in all works, and who sleeps and awakes (in) due (time) 4. When (a\nman\'s) mind well restrained becomes steady upon the self alone, then he being\nindifferent to all objects of desire, is said to be devoted. As a light\nstanding in a windless (place) flickers not, that is declared to be the\nparallel for a devotee, whose mind is restrained, and who devotes his self to\nabstraction. That (mental condition), in which the mind restrained by practice\nof abstraction, ceases to work; in which too, one seeing the self by the self\n5, is pleased in\n\np. 70\n\nthe self; in which one experiences that infinite happiness which transcends\nthe senses, and which can be grasped by the understanding only; and adhering\nto which, one never swerves from the truth; acquiring which, one thinks no\nother acquisition higher than it; and adhering to which, one is not shaken off\neven by great misery; that should be understood to be called devotion in which\nthere is a severance of all connexion with pain. That devotion should be\npractised with steadiness and with an undesponding heart. Abandoning, without\nexception, all desires 1, which are produced from fancies, and restraining the\nwhole group of the senses on all sides by the mind only 2, one should by slow\nsteps become quiescent 3, with a firm resolve coupled with courage 4; and\nfixing his mind upon the self, should think of nothing. Wherever the active\nand unsteady mind breaks forth 5, there one should ever restrain it, and fix\nit steadily on the self alone. The highest happiness comes to such a devotee,\nwhose mind is fully tranquil, in whom the quality of passion has been\nsuppressed, who is free from sin, and who is become (one with) the Brahman.\nThus constantly devoting his self to abstraction, a devotee, freed from sin,\neasily obtains that supreme happiness--contact with the Brahman 6. He who has\ndevoted his self to abstraction, by devotion, looking alike on everything,\nsees the self abiding in all beings, and all beings in\n\np. 71\n\nthe self 1. To him who sees me in everything, and everything in me, I am never\nlost, and he is not lost to me 2. The devotee who worships me abiding in all\nbeings, holding that all is one 3, lives in me, however he may be living 4.\nThat devotee, O Ar _g_ una! is deemed to be the best, who looks alike on\npleasure or pain, whatever it may be, in all (creatures), comparing. all with\nhis own (pleasure or pain) 5.\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nI cannot see, O destroyer of Madhu! (how) the sustained existence (is to be\nsecured) of this devotion by means of equanimity which you have declared-in\nconsequence of fickleness. For, O K _ri_ sh _n_ a! the mind is fickle,\nboisterous 6 strong, and obstinate; and I think that to restrain it is as\ndifficult as (to restrain) the wind.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nDoubtless, O you of mighty arms! the mind is difficult to restrain, and fickle\n7. Still, O son of Kunti! it may be restrained by constant practice and by\nindifference (to worldly objects). It is my belief, that devotion is hard to\nobtain for one who does not restrain his self. But by one who is self-\nrestrained\n\np. 72\n\nand assiduous, it can be obtained through (proper) expedients.\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nWhat is the end of him, O K _ri_ sh _n_ a! who does not attain the\nconsummation of his devotion, being not assiduous 1, and having a mind shaken\noff from devotion, (though) full of faith? Does he, fallen from both (paths)\n2, go to ruin like a broken cloud, being, O you of mighty arms! without\nsupport, and deluded on the path (leading) to the Brahman? Be pleased, O K\n_ri_ sh _n_ a! to entirely destroy this doubt of mine, for none else than you\ncan destroy this doubt.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nO son of P _ri_ tha! neither in this world nor the next, is ruin for him; for,\nO dear friend! none who performs good (deeds) comes to an evil end. He who is\nfallen from devotion attains the worlds of those who perform meritorious acts,\ndwells (there) for many a year, and is afterwards born into a family of holy\nand illustrious 3 men. Or he is even born into a family of talented devotees;\nfor such a birth as that in this world is more difficult to obtain. There he\ncomes into contact with the knowledge which belonged to him in his former\nbody, and then again, O descendant of Kuru! he works for perfection 4. For\neven though reluctant 5, he is led away by the\n\np. 73\n\nself-same former practice, and although he only wishes to learn devotion, he\nrises above the (fruits of action laid down in the) divine word. But the\ndevotee working with great efforts [1](sbe0809.htm#fn_269), and cleared of his\nsins, attains perfection after many births, and then reaches the supreme goal.\nThe devotee is esteemed higher than the performers of penances, higher even\nthan the men of knowledge, and the devotee is higher than the men of action;\ntherefore, O Ar _g_ una! become a devotee. And even among all devotees, he\nwho, being full of faith, worships me, with his inmost self intent on me, is\nesteemed by me to be the most devoted.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[67:1](sbe0807.htm#fr_233) Cf. infra, [p. 18](sbe0802.htm#page_18).\n\n[67:2](sbe0807.htm#fr_234) p. 57 and Ka _th_ opanishad, p. 157.\n\n[67:3](sbe0808.htm#fr_235) Which are required for ordinary religious rites.\n\n[67:4](sbe0808.htm#fr_236) Which are the cause of desires; see supra, [p.\n50](sbe0804.htm#page_50).\n\n[67:5](sbe0808.htm#fr_237) Abandonment of distracting actions; means scil. to\nperfect knowledge, says _S_ ridhara.\n\n[67:6](sbe0808.htm#fr_238) I. e. by means of a mind possessed of true\ndiscrimination.\n\n[68:1](sbe0808.htm#fr_239) Self is here explained as mind, the unsteadiness of\nwhich prevents the acquisition of devotion, p. 71\n\n[68:2](sbe0808.htm#fr_240) This means restraining senses by mind.
