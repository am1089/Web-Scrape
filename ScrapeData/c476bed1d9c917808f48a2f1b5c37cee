VI.\n\nKings of the lunar dynasty. Origin of Soma, or the moon: he carries off Tara,\nthe wife of Vrihaspati: war between the gods and Asuras in consequence:\nappeased by Brahma. Birth of Budha: married to Ila, daughter of Vaivaswata.\nLegend of his son Pururavas, and the nymph Urva\xc5\x9bi: the former institutes\nofferings with fire: ascends to the sphere of the Gandharbas.\n\nMAITREYA.--You have given me, reverend preceptor, an account of the kings of\nthe dynasty of the sun: I am now desirous to hear a description of the princes\nwho trace their lineage from the moon, and whose race is still celebrated for\nglorious deeds. Thou art able to relate it to me, Brahman, if thou wilt so\nfavour me.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--You shall hear from me, Maitreya, an account of the illustrious\nfamily of the moon, which has produced many celebrated rulers of the earth; a\nrace adorned by the regal qualities of strength, valour, magnificence,\nprudence, and activity; and enumerating amongst its monarchs Nahusha, Yayati,\nKartaviryarjuna, and others equally renowned. That race will I describe to\nyou: do you attend.\n\nAtri was the son of Brahma, the creator of the universe, who sprang from the\nlotus that grew from the navel of Narayan\xcc\x81a. The son of Atri was Soma 1 (the\nmoon), whom Brahma installed as the sovereign of plants, of Brahmans, and of\nthe stars. Soma celebrated the Rajasuya sacrifice, and from the glory thence\nacquired, and the extensive dominion with which he had been invested, he\nbecame arrogant and licentious, and carried off Tara, the wife of Vrihaspati,\nthe preceptor of the gods. In vain Vrihaspati sought to recover his bride; in\nvain Brahma commanded, and the holy sages remonstrated; Soma refused to\nrelinquish her. U\xc5\x9banas, out of enmity to Vrihaspati, took part with Soma.\nRudra, who had studied under Angiras, the father of Vrihaspati, befriended his\n\np. 393\n\nfellow-student. In consequence of U\xc5\x9banas, their preceptor, joining Soma,\nJambha, Kujambha, and all the Daityas, Danavas, and other foes of the gods,\ncame also to his assistance; whilst Indra and all the gods were the allies of\nVrihaspati.\n\nThen there ensued a fierce contest, which, being on account of Taraka (or\nTara), was termed the Tarakamaya or Taraka war. In this the gods, led by\nRudra, hurled their missiles on the enemy; and the Daityas with equal\ndetermination assailed the gods. Earth, shaken to her centre by the struggle\nbetween such foes, had recourse to Brahma for protection; on which he\ninterposed, and commanding U\xc5\x9banas with the demons and Rudra with the deities\nto desist from strife, compelled Soma to restore Tara to her husband. Finding\nthat she was pregnant, Vrihaspati desired her no longer to retain her burden;\nand in obedience to his orders she was delivered of a son, whom she deposited\nin a clump of long Munja grass. The child, from the moment of its birth, was\nendued with a splendour that dimmed the radiance of every other divinity, and\nboth Vrihaspati and Soma, fascinated by his beauty, claimed him as their\nchild. The gods, in order to settle the dispute, appealed to Tara; but she was\nashamed, and would make no answer. As she still continued mute to their\nrepeated applications, the child became incensed, and was about to curse her,\nsaying, "Unless, vile woman, you immediately declare who is my father, I will\nsentence you to such a fate as shall deter every female in future from\nhesitating to speak the truth." On this, Brahma again interfered, and pacified\nthe child; and then, addressing Tara, said, "Tell me, daughter, is this the\nchild of Vrihaspati, or of Soma?" "Of Soma," said Tara, blushing. As soon as\nshe had spoken, the lord of the constellations, his countenance bright, and\nexpanding with rapture, embraced his son, and said, "Well done, my boy; verily\nthou art wise:" and hence his name was Budha 2.\n\np. 394\n\nIt has already been related how Budha begot Pururavas by Ila. Pururavas 3 was\na prince renowned for liberality, devotion, magnificence, and love of truth,\nand for personal beauty. Urva\xc5\x9bi having incurred the imprecation of Mitra and\nVarun\xcc\x81a, determined to take up her abode in the world of mortals; and\ndescending accordingly, beheld Pururavas. As soon as she saw him she forgot\nall reserve, and disregarding the delights of Swarga, became deeply enamoured\nof the prince. Beholding her infinitely superior to all other females in\ngrace, elegance, symmetry, delicacy, and beauty, Pururavas was equally\nfascinated by Urva\xc5\x9bi: both were inspired by similar sentiments, and mutually\nfeeling that each was every thing to the other, thought no more of any other\nobject. Confiding in his merits, Pururavas addressed the nymph, and said,\n"Fair creature, I love you; have compassion on me, and return my affection."\nUrva\xc5\x9bi, half averting her face through modesty, replied, "I will do so, if you\nwill observe the conditions I have to propose." "What are they?" inquired the\nprince; "declare them." "I have two rams," said the nymph, "which I love as\nchildren; they must be kept near my bedside, and never suffered to be carried\naway: you must also take care never to he seen by me undressed; and clarified\nbutter alone must be my food." To these terms the king readily gave assent.\n\nAfter this, Pururavas and Urva\xc5\x9bi dwelt together in Alaka, sporting amidst the\ngroves and lotus-crowned lakes of Chaitraratha, and the other forests there\nsituated, for sixty-one thousand years 4. The love of\n\np. 395\n\n[paragraph continues] Pururavas for his bride increased every day of its\nduration; and the affection of Urva\xc5\x9bi augmenting equally in fervour, she never\ncalled to recollection residence amongst the immortals. Not so with the\nattendant spirits at the court of Indra; and nymphs, genii, and quiristers,\nfound heaven itself but dull whilst Urva\xc5\x9bi was away. Knowing the agreement\nthat Urva\xc5\x9bi had made with the king, Vi\xc5\x9bwavasu was appointed by the Gandharbas\nto effect its violation; and he, coming by night to the chamber where they\nslept, carried off one of the rams. Urva\xc5\x9bi was awakened by its cries, and\nexclaimed, Ah me! who has stolen one of my children? Had I a husband, this\nwould not have happened! To whom shall I apply for aid?" The Raja overheard\nher lamentation, but recollecting that he was undressed, and that Urva\xc5\x9bi might\nsee him in that state, did not move from the couch. Then the Gandharbas came\nand stole the other ram; and Urva\xc5\x9bi, hearing it bleat, cried out that a woman\nhad no protector who was the bride of a prince so dastardly as to submit to\nthis outrage. This incensed Pururavas highly, and trusting that the nymph\nwould not see his person, as it was dark, he rose, and took his sword, and\npursued the robbers, calling upon them to stop, and receive their punishment.\nAt that moment the Gandharbas caused a flash of brilliant lightning to play\nupon the chamber, and Urva\xc5\x9bi beheld the king undressed: the compact was\nviolated, and the nymph immediately disappeared. The Gandharbas, abandoning\nthe rams, departed to the region of the gods.\n\nHaving recovered the animals, the king returned delighted to his couch, but\nthere he beheld no Urva\xc5\x9bi; and not finding her any where, he wandered naked\nover the world, like one insane. At length coming to Kurukshetra, he saw\nUrva\xc5\x9bi sporting with four other nymphs of heaven in a lake beautified with\nlotuses, and he ran to her, and called her his wife, and wildly implored her\nto return. "Mighty monarch," said the nymph, "refrain from this extravagance.\nI am now pregnant: depart at present, and come hither again at the end of a\nyear, when I will deliver to you a son, and remain with you for one night."\nPururavas, thus comforted, returned to his capital. Urva\xc5\x9bi said to her\ncompanions, "This prince is a most excellent mortal: I lived with him\n\np. 396\n\nlong and affectionately united." "It was well done of you," they replied; "he\nis indeed of comely appearance, and one with whom we could live happily for\never."\n\nWhen the year had expired, Urva\xc5\x9bi and the monarch met at Kurukshetra, and she\nconsigned to him his first-born \xc3\x81yus; and these annual interviews were\nrepeated, until she had borne to him five sons. She then said to Pururavas,\n"Through regard for me, all the Gandharbas have expressed their joint purpose\nto bestow upon my lord their benediction: let him therefore demand a boon."\nThe Raja replied, "My enemies are all destroyed, my faculties are all entire;\nI have friends and kindred, armies and treasures: there is nothing which I may\nnot obtain except living in the same region with my Urva\xc5\x9bi. My only desire\ntherefore is, to pass my life with her." When he had thus spoken, the\nGandharbas brought to Pururavas a vessel with fire, and said to him, "Take\nthis fire, and, according to the precepts of the Vedas, divide it into three\nfires; then fixing your mind upon the idea of living with Urva\xc5\x9bi, offer\noblations, and you shall assuredly obtain your wishes." The Raja took the\nbrasier, and departed, and came to a forest. Then he began to reflect that he\nhad committed a great folly in bringing away the vessel of fire instead of his\nbride; and leaving the vessel in the wood, he went disconsolate to his palace.\nIn the middle of the night he awoke, and considered that the Gandharbas had\ngiven him the brasier to enable him to obtain the felicity of living with\nUrva\xc5\x9bi, and that it was absurd in him to have left it by the way. Resolving\ntherefore to recover it, he rose, and went to the place where he had deposited\nthe vessel; but it was gone. In its stead he saw a young A\xc5\x9bwattha tree growing\nout of a \xc5\x9aami plant, and he reasoned with himself, and said, "I left in this\nspot a vessel of fire, and now behold a young A\xc5\x9bwattha tree growing out of a\n\xc5\x9aami plant. Verily I will take these types of fire to my capital, and there,\nhaving engendered fire by their attrition, I will worship it." Having thus\ndetermined, he took the plants to his city, and prepared their wood for\nattrition, with pieces of as many inches long as there are syllables in the\nGayatri: he recited that holy verse, and rubbed together sticks of as many\ninches as he recited syllables in the\n\np. 397\n\n[paragraph continues] Gayatri 5. Having thence elicited fire, he made it\nthreefold, according to the injunctions of the Vedas, and offered oblations\nwith it, proposing as the end of the ceremony reunion with Urva\xc5\x9bi. In this\nway, celebrating many sacrifices agreeably to the form in which offerings are\npresented with fire, Pururavas obtained a seat in the sphere of the\nGandharbas, and was no more separated from his beloved. Thus fire, that was at\nfirst but one, was made threefold in the present Manwantara by the son of Ila\n6.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[392:1](vp098.htm#fr_1040) The Vayu says the essence of Soma (Somatwa) issued\nfrom the eyes of Atri, and impregnated the ten quarters. The Bhagavata says\nmerely that Soma was born from the eyes of Atri. The Brahma P. and Hari V.\ngive a grosser name to the effusion.\n\n[393:2](vp098.htm#fr_1041) \'He who knows.\' Much erroneous speculation has\noriginated in confounding this Budha, the son of Soma, and regent of the\nplanet Mercury, \'he who knows,\' the intelligent, with Buddha, any deified\nmortal, or \'he by whom truth is known;\' or, as individually applicable,\nGautama or \xc5\x9aakya, son of the Raja \xc5\x9auddhodana, by p. 394 whom the Buddhists\nthemselves aver their doctrines were first promulgated. The two characters\nhave nothing in common, and the names are identical only when one or other is\nmisspelt.\n\n[394:3](vp098.htm#fr_1042) The story of Pururavas is told much in the same\nstrain as follows, though with some variations, and in greater or less detail,\nin the Vayu, Matsya, Vamana, Padma, and Bhagavata Puran\xcc\x81as. It is also\nreferred to in the Mahabharata, vol. I. p. 113. It is likewise the subject of\nthe Vikrama and Urva\xc5\x9bi of Kalidasa, in which drama the incidents offensive to\ngood taste are not noticed. See Hindu Theatre, vol. I. p. 587. The Matsya\nPuran\xcc\x81a, besides this story, which is translated in the introduction to the\ndrama, has in another part, c. 94, an account of a Pururavas, who, in the\nChakshusha Manwantara, was king of Mad\xcc\x81ra, and who by the worship of Vishn\xcc\x81u\nobtained a residence with the Gandharbas.\n\n[394:4](vp098.htm#fr_1043) One copy has sixty-one years; the Brahma P. and\nHari V. have fifty-nine: one period is as likely as the other.\n\n[397:5](vp098.htm#fr_1044) It does not appear why this passage is repeated.\nThe length of the sticks, conformably to the number of syllables in the usual\nform of the Gayatri, would be twenty-four inches. The Bhagavata attaches to\nthe operation a piece of mysticism of a Tantrika origin: Pururavas, whilst\nperforming the attrition, mentally identifies himself and Urva\xc5\x9bi with the two\nsticks, and repeats the Mantra, ###.\n\n[397:6](vp098.htm#fr_1045) The division of one fire into three is ascribed to\nPururavas by the Mahabharata and the rest. The commentator on the former\nspecifies them as the Garhapatya, Dakshin\xcc\x81a, and \xc3\x81havaniya, which Sir Wm.\nJones, Manu, II. 231, renders nuptial, ceremonial, and sacrificial fires; or\nrather, 1. household, that which is perpetually maintained by a householder;\n2. a fire for sacrifices, placed to the south of the rest; and 3. a\nconsecrated fire for oblations; forming the Tretagni, or triad of sacred\nfires, in opposition to the Laukika, or merely temporal ones. To Pururavas it\nwould appear the triple arrangement was owing; but there are some other\ncurious traditions regarding him, which indicate his being the author of some\nimportant innovations in the Hindu ritual. The Bhagavata says, that before his\ntime there was but one Veda, one caste, one fire, and one god, Narayan\xcc\x81a; and\nthat, in the beginning of the Treta age, Pururavas made them all \'three:\' that\nis, according to the commentator, the ritual was then instituted: The Matsya\nP. has an account of this prince\'s going to the orbit of the sun and moon at\nevery conjunction, when oblations to progenitors are to be offered, as if\nobsequial rites had originated with Pururavas. The Mahabharata states some\nstill more remarkable particulars. \'The glorious Pururavas, endowed, although\na mortal, with the properties of a deity, governing the thirteen islands of\nthe ocean, engaged in hostilities with the Brahmans in the pride of his\nstrength, and seized their jewels, as they exclaimed against his oppression.\nSanatkumara came from the sphere of Brahma to teach him the rules of duty, but\nPururavas did not accept his instructions, and the king, deprived of\nunderstanding by the pride of his power, and actuated by avarice, was\ntherefore ever accursed by the offended great sages, and was destroyed.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VII](vp099.htm)\n\n'
