Raising his right arm, putting the head into (the upavita), he suspends\n(the cord) over his left shoulder, so that it hangs down on his right side:\nthus he becomes ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ opavitin.\n\n3\\. Raising his left arm, putting the head into (the upavita), he suspends it\nover his right shoulder, so that it hangs down on his left side: thus he\nbecomes pra _k_ inavitin.\n\n4\\. Pra _k_ inavitin, however, he is only at sacrifices offered to the Manes.\n\n5. 5 Having gone in a northern direction from the fire, having washed his hands and feet, and having seated himself, he should sip water three times and wipe off (the water) twice.\n\n6\\. Having besprinkled his feet (with water) let him besprinkle his head.\n\n7\\. Let him touch the organs of his senses with water:\n\n8\\. The two eyes, the nose, the two ears.\n\n9\\. Whatever (limb of his body) requires his consideration (whether it is pure\nor not), that he should touch with water (i.e. with a wet hand).\n\n10\\. Here they say:\n\n11\\. Let him not touch (himself with water, or sip water) while walking,\n\n12\\. Nor standing,\n\n13\\. Nor laughing,\n\n14\\. Nor looking about,\n\n15\\. Nor without bending down,\n\np. 18\n\n16\\. Nor (throwing up the water) with his fingers,\n\n17. 17 Nor except with the (proper) Tirtha,\n\n18\\. Nor uttering a sound,\n\n19\\. Nor without looking (at the water),\n\n20. 20 Nor with his shoulders put back,\n\n21. 21 Nor wearing a part of his under garment as if it were an upper garment,\n\n22\\. Nor with warm water,\n\n23\\. Nor with foamy water,\n\n24\\. And in no case wearing sandals,\n\n25. 25 (Not) with a turban on his head (?),\n\n26\\. (Not with his garment) tied round his neck,\n\n27\\. And not stretching out his feet.\n\n28. 28 When he has finally touched (water) again, he becomes pure.\n\n29. 29 Let him, however, sip only water that reaches his heart.\n\n30\\. For if he does otherwise, he remains impure.\n\n31\\. Now the cases in which he has to touch (water) a second time.\n\np. 19\n\n32. 32 Having slept, or eaten, or sneezed, or taken a bath, or drunk something, or changed (his garments), or walked on the high road, or gone to a cemetery, he should sip water and then sip water again.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[16:1](sbe30005.htm#fr_106) 2, 1-4. Rules regarding the Upavita. Khadira-G\n_ri_ hya I, 1, 4-6. Compare the detailed description of the nine threads of\nwhich the Upavita-string should consist, in the G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha II, 48\nseqq. A string was evidently considered as the regular and preferable form of\nthe Upavita; with regard to the second kind of Upavita mentioned in Sutra 1,\nthe commentary says, 'A garment (is used), p. 17 if the Upavita has been lost,\nfor instance, in a forest, and if it is impossible to get a string.' A similar\nremark is given with reference to the third kind of Upavita, the rope of Ku\n_s_ a grass.\n\n[17:5](sbe30005.htm#fr_107) 5-32. Rules regarding the a _k_ amana and upaspar\n_s_ ana. Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 1, 7-10; Manu II, 60 seqq.\n\n[18:17](sbe30005.htm#fr_108) As to the Tirthas (or parts of the hand) sacred\nto the different deities or beings, comp. Vasish _th_ a III, 64 seqq., &c. See\nalso Manu II, 58.\n\n[18:20](sbe30005.htm#fr_109) According to the commentary he has to hold his\nhands between his knees. Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh.-G _ri_ hya I, 10, 8. Thus the\nshoulders are brought forward.\n\n[18:21](sbe30005.htm#fr_110) 21-27. These Sutras form three regular _S_ loka\nhemistichs. Only at the end of the second hemistich there is a metrical\nirregularity (sopanatka _h_ kva _k_ it standing at the end of the verse).\n\n[18:25](sbe30005.htm#fr_111) Kasaktika _h_ , which the commentary explains as\na compound of ka, 'the head,' and asaktika = avesh _t_ ika.\n\n[18:28](sbe30005.htm#fr_112) Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 1, 10.\n\n[18:29](sbe30005.htm#fr_113) In other texts (for instance, Manu II, 62; Vasish\n_th_ a III, 31 seqq.) it is stated that a Brahma _n_ a should sip water that\nreaches his heart, a Kshatriya water reaching his throat, a Vai _s_ ya water\nthat wets his palate; a _S_ udra should only touch water with his lips.\n\n[19:32](sbe30005.htm#fr_114) This Sutra again forms a Sloka, though a slightly\nirregular Sloka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3](sbe30006.htm)\n\n"
