'Air (vayu) is indeed the end of all 2. For when fire goes out, it goes\ninto air. When the sun goes down, it goes into air. When the moon goes down,\nit goes into air.\n\n2\\. 'When water dries up, it goes into air. Air indeed consumes them all. So\nmuch with reference to the Devas.\n\n3\\. 'Now with reference to the body. Breath (pra _n_ a) is indeed the end of\nall. When a man sleeps, speech goes into breath, so do sight, hearing, and\nmind. Breath indeed consumes them all.\n\n4\\. 'These are the two ends, air among the Devas, breath among the senses (pra\n_n_ ah).'\n\n________________\n\n5\\. Once while _S_ aunaka Kapeya and Abhipratarin Kakshaseni were being waited\non at their meal, a religious student begged of them. They gave him nothing.\n\n6\\. He said: 'One god--who is he?--swallowed the four great ones 3, he, the\nguardian of the world.\n\np. 59\n\n[paragraph continues] O Kapeya, mortals see him not, O Abhipratarin, though he\ndwells in many places. He to whom this food belongs, to him it has not been\ngiven 1.'\n\n7\\. _S_ aunaka Kapeya, pondering on that speech, went to the student and said:\n'He is the self of the Devas, the creator of all beings, with golden tusks,\nthe eater, not without intelligence. His greatness is said to be great indeed,\nbecause, without being eaten, he eats even what is not food 2. Thus do we, O\nBrahma _k_ arin, meditate on that Being.' Then he said: 'give him food.'\n\n8\\. They gave him food. Now these five (the eater Vayu (air), and his food,\nAgni (fire), \xc3\x82ditya (sun), _K_ andramas (moon), Ap (water)) and the other five\n(the eater Pra _n_ a (breath), and his food, speech, sight, hearing, mind)\nmake ten, and that is the K _ri_ ta (the highest 3) cast (representing the\nten, the eaters and the food). Therefore in all quarters those ten are food\n(and) K _ri_ ta (the highest cast). These are again the Vira _g_  4 (of ten\nsyllables)\n\np. 60\n\nwhich eats the food. Through this all this becomes seen. He who knows this\nsees all this and becomes an eater of food, yea, he becomes an eater of food.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:2](sbe01080.htm#fr_201) Sa _m_ varga, absorption, whence sa _m_\nvargavidya, not sa _m_ sarga. It is explained by sa _m_ var _g_ ana, sa _m_\ngraha _n_ a, and sa _m_ grasana, in the text itself by adana, eating.\n\n[58:3](sbe01080.htm#fr_202) This must refer to Vayu and Pra _n_ a swallowing\nthe four, as explained in IV, 3, 2, and IV, 3, 3. The commentator explains p.\n59 it by Pra _g_ apati, who is sometimes called Ka. In one sense it would be\nBrahman, as represented by Vayu and Pra _n_ a.\n\n[59:1](sbe01080.htm#fr_203) The food which you have refused to me, you have\nreally refused to Brahman.\n\n[59:2](sbe01080.htm#fr_204) _S_ aunaka wishes the student to understand that\nthough I mortals see him not,' he sees and knows him, viz. the god who, as\nVayu, swallows all the gods, but produces them again, and who, as pra _n_ a,\nswallows during sleep all senses, but produces them again at the time of\nwaking.\n\n[59:3](sbe01080.htm#fr_205) The words are obscure, and the commentator does\nnot throw much light on them. He explains, however, the four casts of the\ndice, the K _ri_ ta = 4, the Treta = 3, the Dvapara = 2, the Kali = 1, making\ntogether 10, the K _ri_ ta cast absorbing the other casts, and thus counting\nten.\n\n[59:4](sbe01080.htm#fr_206) Vira _g_ , name of a metre of ten syllables, and\nalso a name of food. One expects, 'which is the food and eats the food.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4](sbe01081.htm)\n\n"
