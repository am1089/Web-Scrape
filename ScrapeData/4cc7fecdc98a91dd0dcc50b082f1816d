Krishnu enquired, "What it is?"\nThe Raja said,\n\np. 360\n\n[paragraph continues] "O great king! it is my wish to perform a royal\nsacrifice, and present it as an offering to you, and thereby cross over the\nsea of the world." On hearing these words Shree Krishnu Chund was delighted,\nand said, "Raja! you have formed a good wish, by this gods, men, saints and\nsages will all be gratified; this will be agreeable to all, and it is not at\nall difficult for you to do this; because your four brothers, Urjoon, Bheem,\nNukool and Suhdeo are very renowned and powerful; there is not any one in the\nworld now who can oppose them; first send them forth to conquer, and bring\nunder subjection the Rajas of the ten quarters of the world, and after that\nperform the sacrifice at your ease."\n\nRaja! when Krishnu had thus spoken, the Raja Joodisthur sent for his four\nbrothers, and giving them armies, sent them in four different directions;\nSuhdeo Jee went to the South, Nukool to the West, Urjoon to the North, and\nBheemsen to the East. Some time after this, O great king! the four brothers,\nby the glorious favour of Huri, having conquered the seven islands and nine\ndivisions of the earth, and subjugated the Rajas of the ten quarters, brought\nthem back with them, at that time Raja Joodisthur, having joined his hands,\nsaid to Shree Krishnu Chund Jee, "O great king! through your aid this business\nhas been accomplished; what are your orders now?" Upon this, Oodho Jee said,\n"O incarnation of justice! the kings of all countries have come, with\nexception of the Raja Joorasindhoo, of the Mugudh country, who is not under\nyour authority; and until he shall be made subject to you, it will not be of\nadvantage to perform the sacrifice. The Raja Joorasindhoo, the son of Jydruth,\nis very mighty and renowned, and liberal and just; not every one has power to\noppose him." When the Raja Joodisthur having heard this was sad; Shree Krishnu\nChund said, "O great king! be not at all anxious, but give the order to my\nbrothers, Bheem and Urjoon, and to me,\n\np. 361\n\nand we will, either by force or stratagem, bring him here bound, or kill him."\nOn hearing these words, Raja Joodisthur gave the order to the two brothers;\nand then Huri, accompanied by the two brothers, took the road to the Mugudh\ncountry; when they had advanced some distance on their journey, Shree Krishnu\nChund Jee said to Urjoon and Bheem, "Travel as brahmins, and let us kill our\nenemy by stratagem or force."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee assumed the\nappearance of a brahmin, and Bheem and Urjoon did the same also. The three\nhaving drawn three horizontal lines across their foreheads, and taking each a\nbook under his arm, went along assuming the same bright, handsome, elegant and\nwell-arranged appearance, as the three properties of humanity, truth, passion\nand ignorance, would assume, if they put on corporeal form, or as the three\ntimes, present, past and future, would assume. At length, after some days\'\njourney, they arrived in the Mugudh country, and at mid-day stood at the gate\nof the Raja Joorasindhoo. On seeing their appearance, the gate-keepers went,\nand said to the Raja, "O great king! three brahmin guests (or beggars) of very\nsplendid appearance, great pundits, and very intelligent are standing at the\ngate, desirous of some thing. What are your orders to us?"\n\nO great king! at these words, Raja Joorasindhoo rose up, and came to where the\nbrahmins were standing; and having made an obeisance to the three, conducted\nthem with the greatest respect and deference to his house; afterwards, having\nseated them on a throne, he stood in their presence with joined hands, and\nlooking at then, and reflecting said, "The beggar, who being a great Raja,\ncomes to another man\'s gate, is called a guest, you are not brahmins, but\nstrong, powerful men of war, deceit of any kind is wrong; if a thug (or\nimpostor) come as such, he is regarded in his proper character, and  not as an\nhonest man; the lustre of your Chutree appearance\n\np. 362\n\ncannot be concealed: you seem to be resolute, bold, strong men. You three\nbrothers are splendid to behold, bestowers of boons like Shivu, Bruhmu and\nVishnu. This is what appears probable to me; but do you, O deities! give an\nexplanation yourselves; whatever you may desire I will do for you, and will\nnot swerve from my agreement. A liberal man never speaks falsely, and will not\nkeep back his wealth, body or any thing else; I will make you any present you\nask for, my children, wives, any thing I may have, and my life."\n\nOn hearing these words, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee said, "O great king! once on a\ntime, there was a very liberal Raja, named Hurchund, whose fame is still\nspread abroad in the world; on one occasion there was a famine in Raja\nHurchund\'s country; and in consequence of the dearth of grain vast numbers of\npeople began to die; upon this, the Raja sold all his property, and gave food\nto his people; when all his country, towns and wealth were gone; and the Raja\nwas left without any money, one evening he was sitting hungry with his family,\nwhen Biswamittru came, and, in order to test his truth and sincerity, said, \'O\ngreat king! give me wealth, and derive the same advantage from doing so, as\nyou would derive from giving a daughter in marriage.\' On hearing this speech,\nthe Raja brought out all that was in his house, and gave it him, then the holy\nman said, \'O great king! my business will not be completed with this much\nmoney.\' After this the Raja sold his male and female servants, and brought the\nproceeds, and gave them to the sage; and having expended all his wealth, and\nsold all his servants, he was left without money and without servants, and\nonly with his wives and children. The sage again said, \'O form of justice! my\nbusiness has not been accomplished by the money you have given me to whom\nshall I go now, and ask for more? I do not know of any one in the world, who\nis wealthier, more virtuous and liberal than you are. Yes,\n\np. 363\n\nthere is a Chundal, named Soopuch, who is a vessel of wealth; if you tell me\nto do so, I will go and ask him for money, but I am ashamed to do so for one\nreason, that having begged from so liberal a Raja, what should I beg from\nhim?\' O great king! on hearing these words, Raja Hurchund took Biswamittru\nwith him, and went to the house of that Chundal, and said to him, \'Brother!\nkeep me in pledge for a year, and fulfil his wishes for him.\' Soopuch said,\n\'How will you be able to do my work and banish all pride and passion from your\nmind? You are a very illustrious and mighty Raja; and the service you will\nhave to perform for me is of a low, menial kind and severe. O great king! my\nbusiness is to keep watch in a [cemetery](errata.htm#19), and to receive a tax\non every corpse that comes there, and afterwards to watch and guard my own\nhouse; if you can do this, I will give the rupees required, and keep you in\npledge.\' The Raja said, \'Well I will serve you for a year; give him the\nmoney.\' When the Raja had thus spoken, Soopuch counted out the money to\nBiswamittru, which he took away to his home; and the Raja remaining at the\nChundal\'s house, began to wait upon him. After some days, Raja Hurchund\'s son,\nRoohitas, died; and his mother went with her son\'s corpse into the burying\nplace; and as she was on the point of lighting the funeral pile she had\nerected, the Raja came, and asked for the tax; the Ranee being displeased and\ngrieved said, \'Consider and reflect, O Raja! this is your son, Roohitas, and I\nhave nothing wherewith to pay the tax, except this cloth, which I am now\nwearing.\' The Raja replied; \'I have no option in the matter; I am employed on\nmy master\'s business, and if I do not do his work, my character for truth will\nbe lost.\' O great king! when the Ranee, on hearing this, put her hand on the\nborder of the cloth to take it off, the three worlds trembled. Upon this\nBhugwan, who had observed the sincerity of the Raja and Ranee, first sent a\nchariot, and afterwards having appeared\n\np. 364\n\nhimself, liberated all three. O great king! when Bruhmu, having restored\nRoohitas to life, and seated the Raja and Ranee, together with their son, on a\nchariot, gave the order to proceed to the celestial paradise, Raja Hurchund\njoining his hands, said to Bhugwan, \'O brother of the poor, purifying the\nguilty and kind to the wretched! how can I go and dwell in paradise without\nSoopuch?\' Having heard this speech, and knowing the Raja\'s secret wishes,\nHuri, the benefactor of his worshippers, the sea of compassion, granted\ndeliverance to Soopuch, together with the city in which he abode, and to the\nRaja, Ranee and their son. There Hurchund obtained immortality; and here for\nages, his fame has been handed down."\n\nHaving mentioned this account of Hurchund to Joorasindhoo Shree Krishnu Chund\nJee said, "O great king! and besides the above instance, Ratdee performed a\npenance, during which he remained forty-eight days without water; and when he\nsat down to drink, some one, who was thirsty, came to him. He did not drink\nany water himself, but gave it to the thirsty man; and by the gift of that\nwater, obtained salvation. Again the Raja Buli was very munificent in his\ngifts, and obtained the government of the infernal regions, and even yet, his\ngreat renown is being handed down. Again the sage Oodwal ate after six months\'\nfasting. On one occasion a beggar came to him, when it was his eating time; he\ndid not himself eat any food, but gave it to the beggar, and died from excess\nof the hunger [he then](errata.htm#20) endured, and afterwards in consequence\nof having given away his food, he went to Vishnu\'s celestial paradise, mounted\non a chariot. Again, on one occasion, Raja Indru went with all the gods, and\nsaid to Dudheech, \'O great king! we cannot escape now from the hands of\nBrittasoor, unless you give us one of your bones, and then we shall escape,\notherwise escape will be difficult, because he can only be destroyed by a\nweapon, formed of one of your bones.\' On hearing this, O great king! Dudheech\nhaving had his body licked by a cow\n\np. 365\n\nextracted his thigh bone and gave it to the gods, who made it into a\nthunderbolt, and Dudheech having sacrificed his life, obtained paradise. Such\nare instances of men of boundless liberality, whose fame the world\ncelebrates."\n\nRaja! having thus spoken, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee, said to Joorasindhoo, "O\ngreat king! you equal in the present age the just and liberal Rajas, who\nflourished formerly in other ages, and now satisfy our expectations in the\nsame way, that formerly they fulfilled the desires of those who solicited\nthem. There is a saying, \'What will not a beggar ask, and what will not a\nliberal man give; he has no avaricious desire for his house, sons and wives,\nbut will give up his body and head, and obtain celebrity.\'" When Krishnu had\nthus spoken, Joorasindhoo said, "A beggar has no sympathy with a donor, but in\nspite of this the liberal and resolute do not lay aside their usual\ndispositions, whether they derive pleasure or pain from the exercise of them.\nLo! Huri, being disguised as, and transformed into, a dwarf, went to the Raja\nBuli, an asked for three paces of ground; at that time, Shookru cautioned Buli\nnot to give it, but the Raja did not swerve from his promise, he gave the\nearth together with his body, and has obtained renown in the world by this\nact. What celebrity has Vishnu acquired by being a beggar, who, having\nreceived every thing, acted perversely? For this reason, do you first of all\nexplain your names, and your mysterious appearance, and I will then grant\nwhatever you ask. I do not speak falsely." Shree Krishnu Chund replied, "Raja!\nwe are Chutrees; Basoodeo is my name; you know me very well, and these two,\nUrjoon and Bheem, are my father\'s sister\'s children; we have come to fight\nwith you, be pleased to fight with us; we have come here to make this request,\nand do not ask any thing else from you." Having, O great king! heard this\nspeech of Shree Krishnu Chund Jee\'s, Joorasindhoo laughed and said, "Why\nshould I fight with you; you have already fled from before me? Nor\n\np. 366\n\nwill I fight with Urjoon, because he went into the Bidurubh country, disguised\nas a woman; there remains Bheemsen, with whom I will fight, if you wish it, he\nis my equal, and I am not ashamed to fight with him. First of all refresh\nyourselves with food, and afterwards wrestle in the palaestra." Having given\nthem refreshments the Raja came out, and sent a message to Bheemsen. He gave\nhim his own club, and took himself one belonging to another man. Moorari went\nand sat where all the spectators were assembled in a circle, Joorasindhoo and\nBheemsen stood up simultaneously, opposed to each other; they had helmets on\ntheir heads, and fastened tight the cloths they wore round their hips, and\ntucked them in behind, appearing very like jugglers.\n\nO great king! when the two heroes striking the upper part of their arms in\npreparation for the encounter, holding their clubs at arm\'s length, changing\ntheir attitudes, and moving slowly from side to side, confronted each other in\nthe palaestra, they seemed like two " _must_ " elephants, rushing upon each\nother. Before the struggle commenced, Joorasindhoo said to Bheemsen, "Strike\nthe first blow with your club, because you came to my gate in the appearance\nof a brahmin; and I will not, therefore, strike you first." Having heard this,\nBheemsen replied, "Raja! we will have a fair fight, and the understanding is\nnot necessary, that I should strike first, let who will, strike first."\n\nO great king! these two brave men having thus conversed with each other, aimed\nblows simultaneously, and began to fight. They watched each other\'s\nstratagems, inflicting wounds right and left; and jumped about, avoiding\nblows, and sparred and fought club against club; they struck their clubs\nviolently against each other, making them clash, and inflicting wounds. Great\nnoise and tumult were produced by the collision.\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! in this manner those two resolute antagonists had a\nfair fight during the\n\np. 367\n\nwhole day; and coming in the evening to the house, ate and rested together.\nThey thus spent twenty-seven days, fighting continually; when one day at their\nfighting time, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee thought to himself, that Joorasindhoo\ncould not be destroyed by this mode of encounter, because, when he was born,\nhe was born in two separate parts; and the female Demon, Jura, his mother,\nclosed his mouth and nose; and then the two separate parts were united. Having\nbeen informed of this circumstance, his father, Jyedruth, summoned the\nastrologers, and enquired from them, "What the child\'s name should be, and\nwhat would be his future career?" The astrologers said, "O great king! his\nname is Joorasindhoo, and he shall acquire a very glorious reputation, and\nshall not be subject to the infirmities of age, and shall be immortal: and\nshall not be destroyed by any one, until the junction, uniting the two\nseparate parts of his body, shall be rent asunder."\n\nHaving thus spoken, the astrologers took leave. O great king! Shree Krishnu\nJee reflected upon these matters in his mind; and, having bestowed his own\nstrength upon Bheemsen, and splitting a straw winked to him, that he must\nsplit up Joorasindhoo in the same manner. On receiving this hint from Krishnu,\nBheemsen laid hold of Joorasindhoo and threw him down, and having placed his\nfoot on one of his thighs, and laying hold of his other foot with his hand, he\ntore him asunder, just as any one would tear asunder a stick for cleaning the\nteeth. On the death of Joorasindhoo, gods, men and celestial musicians,\nplaying upon drums and other musical instruments, and raining down flowers,\nbegan to raise shouts of victory; and grief and calamity having departed, was\ndiffused throughout the city. At that time, the wife of Joorasindhoo came and\nstood, weeping and lamenting in the presence of Krishnu, joining her hands,\nshe exclaimed, "Bravo! bravo! you have great reason to exult, O lord! in\nhaving taken away the life of him, who gave you every thing, this is the sort\nof\n\np. 368\n\nfriendship, you show to one, who resigns to you his sons, wealth and body.\nUnder a disguised appearance you have practised deceit and violence, and this\nis the celebrity you have acquired coming into the world."\n\nO great king! when the wife of Joorasindhoo, from tenderness for her husband\'s\nmemory, spoke thus solicitingly, with joined hands in presence of the abode of\nmercy; then Krishnu taking compassion on her, first performed the funeral\nobsequies of Joorasindhoo, and having afterwards sent for his son, Suhdeo,\nmaking the marks of sovereignty on his forehead, and seating him on a throne\nsaid, "Son! carry on a moral government, and protect sages, holy men, cows,\nbrahmins and your subjects."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXIV](psa75.htm)\n\n'
