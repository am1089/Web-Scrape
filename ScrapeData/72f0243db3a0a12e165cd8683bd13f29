From the designation of the 'other' (as non-different from Brahman) there\nresult (Brahman's) not creating what is beneficial, and other imperfections.\n\n'Thou art that'; 'this Self is Brahman'--these and similar texts which declare\nthe non-difference of the world from Brahman, teach, as has been said before,\nat the same time the non-difference from Brahman of the individual soul also.\nBut an objection here presents itself. If these texts really imply that the\n'other one,' i.e. the soul, is Brahman, there will follow certain\nimperfections on Brahman's part, viz. that Brahman, endowed as it is with\nomniscience, the power of realising its purposes, and so on, does not create a\nworld of a nature beneficial to itself, but rather creates a world non-\nbeneficial to itself; and the like. This world no doubt is a storehouse of\nnumberless pains, either originating in living beings themselves or due to the\naction of other natural beings, or caused by supernatural agencies. No\nrational independent person endeavours to produce what is clearly non-\nbeneficial to himself. And as you hold the view of the non-difference of the\nworld from Brahman, you yourself set aside all those texts which declare\nBrahman to be different from the soul; for were there such difference, the\ndoctrine of general non-difference could not be established. Should it be\nmaintained that the texts declaring difference refer to difference due to\nlimiting adjuncts, while the texts declaring non-difference mean essential\nnon-difference, we must ask the following question--does the non-conditioned\nBrahman know, or does it not know, the soul which is essentially non-different\nfrom it? If it does not know it, Brahman's omniscience has to be abandoned.\nIf, on the other hand, it knows it, then\n\np. 468\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman is conscious of the pains of the soul--which is\nnon-different from Brahman--as its own pains; and from this there necessarily\nfollows an imperfection, viz. that Brahman does not create what is beneficial\nand does create what is non-beneficial to itself. If, again, it be said that\nthe difference of the soul and Brahman is due to Nescience on the part of\nboth, and that the texts declaring difference refer to difference of this\nkind, the assumption of Nescience belonging to the soul leads us to the very\nalternatives just stated and to their respective results. Should the a _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana, on the other hand, belong to Brahman, we point out that Brahman, whose\nessential nature is self-illuminedness, cannot possibly be conscious of a _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana and the creation of the world effected by it. And if it be said that the\nlight of Brahman is obscured by a _g \xc3\xb1_ana, we point to all the difficulties,\npreviously set forth, which follow from this hypothesis--to obscure light\nmeans to make it cease, and to make cease the light of Brahman, of whom light\nis the essential nature, means no less than to destroy Brahman itself. The\nview of Brahman being the cause of the world thus shows itself to be\nuntenable.--This prima facie view the next Sutra refutes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 22.
