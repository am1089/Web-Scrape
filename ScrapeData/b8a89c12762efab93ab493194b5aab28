And that of a Kshatriya dyed with madder,\n\n2\\. And that of a Vai _s_ ya dyed with turmeric.\n\n3\\. (The skin),worn by a Brahma _n_ a shall be that of a common deer or of a\nblack doe. 3\n\n4\\. If he wears a black skin, let him not spread it (on the ground) to sit or\nlie upon it.\n\n5\\. (The skin worn) by a Kshatriya shall be that of a spotted deer.\n\n6\\. (The skin worn) by a Vai _s_ ya shall be that of a he-goat.\n\n7\\. The skin of a sheep is fit to be worn by all castes,\n\n8\\. And a blanket made of wool.\n\n9\\. He who wishes the increase of Brahma _n_ a power shall wear skins only; he\nwho wishes the increase of Kshatriya power shall wear cloth only; he who\nwishes the increase of both shall wear both (skin and cloth). Thus says a\nBrahma _n_ a. 9\n\n10\\. But (I, \xc3\x82pastamba, say), let him wear a skin only as his upper garment.\n10\n\n11\\. Let him not look at dancing. 11\n\n12\\. Let him not go to assemblies (for gambling, &c.), nor to crowds\n(assembled at festivals). 12\n\np. 11\n\n13\\. Let him not be addicted to gossiping.\n\n14\\. Let him be discreet.\n\n15\\. Let him not do anything for his own pleasure in places which his teacher\nfrequents. 15\n\n16\\. Let him talk with women so much (only) as his purpose requires.\n\n17\\. (Let him be) forgiving.\n\n18\\. Let him restrain his organs from seeking illicit objects.\n\n19\\. Let him be untired in fulfilling his duties; 19\n\n20\\. Modest;\n\n21\\. Possessed of self-command\n\n22\\. Energetic;\n\n23\\. Free from anger; 23\n\n24\\. (And) free from envy.\n\n25\\. Bringing all he obtains to his teacher, he shall go begging with a vessel\nin the morning and in the evening, (and he may) beg (from everybody) except\nlow-caste people unfit for association (with \xc3\x82ryas) and Abhi _s_ astas. 25\n\np. 12\n\nA Brahma _n_ a declares: Since a devout student takes away from women, who\nrefuse (to give him alms, the merit gained) by ( _S_ rauta)-sacrifices, by\ngifts, (and) by burnt-offerings (offered in the domestic fire), as well as\ntheir offspring, their cattle, the sacred learning (of their families),\ntherefore, indeed, (a woman) should not refuse (alms) to the crowd of\nstudents; for amongst those (who come to beg), there might be one of that\n(devout) kind, one who thus (conscientiously) keeps his vow.\n\n27\\. Alms (shall) not (be considered) leavings (and be rejected) by inference\nfrom their appearance), but on the strength of ocular or oral testimony\n(only). 27\n\n28\\. A Brahma _n_ a shall beg, prefacing (his request) by the word \'Lady\'; 28\n\n29\\. A Kshatriya (inserting the word) \'Lady\' in the middle (between the words\n\'give alms\');\n\n30\\. A Vai _s_ ya, adding the word \'Lady\' (at the end of the formula).\n\n31\\. (The pupil) having taken those (alms) shall place them before his teacher\nand offer them to him. 31\n\n32\\. He may eat (the food) after having been ordered to do so by his teacher.\n32\n\np. 13\n\n33\\. If the teacher is absent, the pupil (shall offer the food) to (a member\nof) the teacher\'s family.\n\n34\\. If the (family of the teacher) is (also) absent, the pupil (may offer the\nfood) to other learned Brahma _n_ as ( _S_ rotriyas) also (and receive from\nthem the permission to eat). 34\n\n35\\. He shall not beg for his own sake (alone). 35\n\n36\\. After he has eaten, he himself shall clean his dish. 36\n\n37\\. And he shall leave no residue (in his dish).\n\n38\\. If he cannot (eat all that he has taken in his dish), he shall bury (the\nremainder) in the ground;\n\n39\\. Or he may throw it into the water;\n\n40\\. Or he may place (all that remains in a pot), and put it down near an\n(uninitiated) \xc3\x82rya; 40\n\n41\\. Or (he may put it down) near a _S_ udra slave (belonging to his teacher).\n\n42\\. If (the pupil) is on a journey, he shall throw 42\n\np. 14\n\na part of the alms into the fire and eat (the remainder).\n\n43\\. Alms are declared to be sacrificial food. In regard to them the teacher\n(holds the position which) a deity (holds in regard to food offered at a\nsacrifice).\n\n44\\. And (the teacher holds also the place which) the \xc3\x82havaniya fire occupies\n(at a sacrifice, because a portion of the alms is offered in the fire of his\nstomach). 44\n\n45\\. To him (the teacher) the (student) shall offer (a portion of the alms),\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[10:3](sbe0206.htm#fr_152) **3**. Manu II, 41; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 29; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G\n_ri_. Su. I, 19, 10.\n\n[10:9](sbe0206.htm#fr_153) See also Gopatha-brahma _n_ a I, 2, 4.\n\n[10:10](sbe0206.htm#fr_154) According to I, 1, 2, 39-I, 1, 3, 10, the rule of\ndress for students is the following:--According to \xc3\x82pastamba, a student shall\nwear a piece of cloth to cover his nakedness (lango _t_ i), and a skin as\nupper garment. Other teachers allow, besides, an upper dress of cloth,\ncoloured differently for the different castes, with or without the addition of\na deer-skin.\n\n[10:11](sbe0206.htm#fr_155) Manu II, 178.\n\n[10:12](sbe0206.htm#fr_156)-13. Manu III, 179; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 33.\n\n[11:15](sbe0206.htm#fr_157) \'Anything for his own pleasure,\' i.e. keeping\nconversations with friends, making his toilet, &c.\n\n[11:19](sbe0206.htm#fr_158) The explanations of the last two terms, _s_ anta\n(Sutra 18) and danta (Sutra 19), are different from those given usually. _S_\nama is usually explained as \'the exclusive direction of the mind towards God,\'\nand dama as \'the restraining of the senses.\'\n\n[11:23](sbe0206.htm#fr_159) Manu II, 178.\n\n[11:25](sbe0206.htm#fr_160) Regarding the explanation of the term Abhi _s_\nasta, see below, I, 7, 21, 17. Haradatta: \'Apapatras are called those born\nfrom a high-caste mother and a low-caste father, such as washermen. For their\ncooking vessels &c. are unfit for the use of the four castes. . . . Since\n\xc3\x82pastamba says, In the evening and in the morning, food obtained in the\nevening must not be used for the morning meal, nor food obtained in the\nmorning for the evening meal."\' Manu II, 182, 183, 185; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su.\nI, 22, 4. See also Gopatha-brahma _n_ a I, 2, 6.\n\n[12:27](sbe0206.htm#fr_161) To eat the residue of the meal of any person\nexcept that left by the teacher and other Gurus, is not permitted to a\nstudent; see also below, I, 1, 4, 1 seq.; Manu II, 56; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 33.\n\n[12:28](sbe0206.htm#fr_162) The formula to be used by a Brahma _n_ a is,\n\'Lady, give alms;\' that to be used by a Kshatriya, \'Give, lady, alms;\' and\nthat used by a Vai _s_ ya, \'Give alms, lady.\' Manu II, 49; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 30;\n\xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 22, 8.\n\n[12:31](sbe0206.htm#fr_163) The words with which be announces the alms are,\nIdam ittham ah _ri_ tam, \'this much have I received.\' Manu II, 51; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_.\nI, 2, 7; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 22, 10.\n\n[12:32](sbe0206.htm#fr_164) The answer of the teacher is, Saumya tvameva\nbhu\xe1\xb9\x85kshva, \'friend, eat thou.\'\n\n[13:34](sbe0206.htm#fr_165) Regarding the term _S_ rotriya, see below, II, 3,\n6. 4.\n\n[13:35](sbe0206.htm#fr_166) \'The meaning of this Sutra is, that the rule\ngiven, Sutra 42 (below), for a pupil who is on a journey, shall hold good also\nfor a pupil who is at home, if (in the absence of his teacher) no _S_ rotriyas\nare to be found (from whom he can receive the permission to eat).\'--Haradatta.\n\n[13:36](sbe0206.htm#fr_167) \'He commits no sin, if he has the alms-pot cleaned\nby somebody else. Some say that the Sutra refers to both vessels (the alms-pot\nand his own dish).\'\n\n[13:40](sbe0206.htm#fr_168) An \xc3\x82rya is a person belonging to one of the first\nthree castes (see below). The \xc3\x82rya must be a boy who is not initiated, because\nchildren are kamabhaksha _h_ , i.e. allowed to eat what they like, even\nleavings.\n\n[13:42](sbe0206.htm#fr_169) This rule holds good if no _S_ rotriyas are near.\nIf _S_ rotriyas are to be found, Sutra 34 applies. Agni, the god of fire, is\nconsidered to be of the Brahminical caste, and hence he takes the place of the\nteacher or of the _S_ rotriyas. See also Manu II, 247, p. 14 248, and the\npassages collected from the Brahma _n_ as, by Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 39.\n\n[14:44](sbe0206.htm#fr_170) Manu II, 231.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 1, Kha _n_ _d_ a 4](sbe0207.htm)\n\n'
