If it be said (that the vidyas are one) on account of (the identity of)\nname; (we reply that) that is explained (already); moreover that (identity of\nname) is (found in the case of admittedly separate vidyas).\n\nHere it might be said that after all the unity of the two vidyas discussed\nmust be admitted, since they are called by one and the same name, viz. 'the\nscience of the udgitha.'--But this argument is of no avail against what has\nbeen said under the preceding Sutra. The decision there advocated has the\nadvantage of following the letter of the revealed text; the name 'udgitha-\nvidya' on the other hand is not a part of the revealed text, but given to the\nvidyas for convenience sake by ordinary men for the reason that the word\n'udgitha' is met with in the text.--Moreover, we observe that admittedly\nseparate meditations such as the two mentioned under the last Sutra have one\nand the same name. Similarly altogether separate sacrificial performances,\nsuch as the agnihotra, the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa, and so on, are all\ncomprised under the one name Ka _th_ aka, merely because they are recorded in\nthe one book called Ka _th_ aka.--Where, on the other hand, there is no\nspecial reason for assuming the difference of vidyas, their unity may be\ndeclared on the ground of identity of name; as, e.g. in the case of the Sa _m_\nvargavidyas.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 9](sbe38152.htm)\n\n"
