[1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n11:5:7\n\n### SEVENTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n11:5:7:11\\. Now, then, the praise of the study (of the scriptures). The study\nand teaching (of the Veda) are a source of pleasure to him, he becomes ready-\nminded 5, and independent of others, and day by day he acquires wealth. He\nsleeps peacefully; he is the best physician for himself; and (peculiar) to him\nare restraint of the senses, delight in the one thing 6, growth of\nintelligence, fame, and the (task of) perfecting the people 7. The growing\n\np. 100\n\nintelligence gives rise to four duties attaching to the Brahma _n_ a--Brahma\n_n_ ical descent, a befitting deportment, fame, and the perfecting of the\npeople; and the people that are being perfected guard the Brahma _n_ a by four\nduties--by (showing him) respect, and liberality, (and by granting him)\nsecurity against oppression, and security against capital punishment.\n\n11:5:7:22\\. And, truly, whatever may be the toils here between heaven and\nearth, the study (of the scriptures) is their last stage, their goal (limit)\nfor him who, knowing this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson\nshould be studied.\n\n11:5:7:33\\. And, verily, whatever portion of the sacred poetry ( _kh_ andas)\nhe studies for his lesson with that sacrificial rite 1, offering is made by\nhim who, knowing this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson\nshould be studied.\n\n11:5:7:44\\. And, verily, if he studies his lesson, even though lying on a soft\ncouch, anointed, adorned and completely satisfied, he is burned (with holy\nfire 2) up to the tips of his nails, whosoever, knowing this, studies his\nlesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied.\n\n11:5:7:55\\. The _Ri_ k-texts, truly, are honey, the Saman-texts ghee, and the\nYa _g_ us-texts ambrosia; and, indeed, when he studies the dialogue that\n(speech and reply) is a mess of milk and a mess of meat.\n\np. 101\n\n11:5:7:66\\. And, indeed, he who, knowing this, studies day by day the _Ri_\nk-texts for his lesson, satisfies the gods with honey, and, thus satisfied,\nthey satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.\n\n11:5:7:77\\. And he who, knowing this, studies day by day the Saman-texts for\nhis lesson, satisfies the gods with ghee; and, being satisfied, they satisfy\nhim by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.\n\n11:5:7:88\\. And he who, knowing this, studies day by day the Ya _g_ us-texts\nfor his lesson, satisfies the gods with ambrosia; and, being satisfied, they\nsatisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.\n\n11:5:7:99\\. And he who, knowing this, studies day by day the dialogue, the\ntraditional myths and legends, for his lesson, satisfies the gods by messes of\nmilk and meat; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of\ndesire, by every kind of enjoyment.\n\n11:5:7:1010\\. Moving, indeed, are the waters, moving is the sun, moving the\nmoon, and moving the stars; and, verily, as if these deities did not move and\nact, even so will the Brahma _n_ a be on that day on which he does not study\nhis lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied. And hence let\nhim at least pronounce either a _Ri_ k-verse or a Ya _g_ us-formula, or a\nSaman-verse, or a Gatha, or a Kumbya 1, to ensure continuity of the Vrata 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[99:5](sbe44031.htm#fr_323) Or, as Saya _n_ a takes it to mean, of intent,\nundistracted mind,--yuktam avikshiptam ekagra _m_ mano yasya sa yuktamana _h_.\n\n[99:6](sbe44031.htm#fr_324) Saya _n_ a seems to take 'ekaramata' in the sense\nof 'remaining always the same,'--eka eva sann a samantad bhavatity ekaramas\ntasya bhava _h_.\n\n[99:7](sbe44031.htm#fr_325) Or, perfecting the world,--tadyukto yo lokas tasya\npakti _h_ paripako bhavati, Say.\n\n[100:1](sbe44031.htm#fr_326) The study of the Veda being 'the sacrifice of the\nBrahman,' the reading of a portion is, as it were, a special rite, or form of\noffering, belonging to that sacrifice. Saya _n_ a, on the other hand, takes it\nto mean that the student performs, as it were, the particular rite, or\noffering, to which the portion he reads may refer. It may, indeed, be implied,\nthough it certainly is not expressed in the text.\n\n[100:2](sbe44031.htm#fr_327) Thus A. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, p. 122;-- _s_\narirapi _d_ anena tapastapto bhavati, Say.\n\n[101:1](sbe44031.htm#fr_328) A 'Kumbya,' according to Saya _n_ a, is a Brahma\n_n_ a-passage explanatory of some sacrificial precept or rite\n(vidhyarthavadatmaka _m_ brahma _n_ a-vakyam); whilst, on Aitareyar. II, 3, 6,\n8, the same commentator explains it as a verse ( _ri_ g-vi _s_ esha) conveying\nsome precept of conduct (a _k_ ara _s_ iksharupa), such as 'brahma _k_\naryasyapo _s_ ana _m_ karma kuru, diva ma svapsi _h_ ,' &c. Cf. Prof. F. Max\nMuller's transl., Upanishads I, p. 230, note 2.\n\n[101:2](sbe44031.htm#fr_329) This is in keeping with the mystic representation\nof this and p. 102 the preceding chapters which represent the daily study of\nthe scriptural lesson as a sacrifice continued day by day. The student, as the\nsacrificer, has accordingly, during the sacrifice (that is, during the period\nof his study of the Vedas, or for life), as it were, to limit his daily food\nto the drinking of the Vrata-milk, which rule he obeys symbolically by\nreciting such a verse or formula.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 5, 8.
