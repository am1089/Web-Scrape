There is no\ndate for its completion. Rutgers thereafter forwarded the text to the Oxford\nText Archive (OTA), where it was "found." They can be reached at\narchive@vax.ox.ac.uk The edition used was that of Aufrecht, 1877\\. Apparently,\naccording to the RLIN, the edition was compiled by H. S. Ananthanarayana and\nW. P. Lehman. It is a "research-only" text. Reputedly, it was verified against\nGrassmann, 1876-77.\n\nAnanthanarayana and Lehman\'s achievement is, as with any encoding of a text--\nespecially a non-roman script language, quite momentous. Nonetheless, whether\nfrom their edition, their text-entry/storage protocol, or other factors, the\ntext was significantly corrupt. Major sections were missing, others completely\nchaotic in their order, and the whole scheme of representing Devanagari in\nASCII characters had to be deciphered.\n\nSubsequently John Robert Gardner, at University of Iowa, collaborated with\nAvinash Sothaye in cross-checking this edited version. They employed Max\nMueller, Aufrecht, and Barend Van Nooten\'s Metrically Restored RV (Harvard\nUniversity Press, #50).\n\nCredit should go next to Kim Poulsen, who found the text, Nandu Abhyankar for\ninitiating its conversion, and Avinash Chopde for performing the conversion to\nITRANS. ITRANS is the wetnurse of proper multi-lingual computing in non- roman\nscripts. Saving the scholar or enthusiast the trouble of learning a new\nkeyboard map and keystrokes designed for torture, ITRANS uses regular ASCII\nalphabet characters to represent, phonetically, the various phonetics of the\nSanskrit (and many others) alphabet (s). Nonetheless, some of these characters\nare less intuitive than others- R^I for the "r" svara, so this is transcribed\n"R," and several other conventions which, while familiar on the net, are not\neffective for the ITRANS coding. ITRANS proper allows machine conversion from\nsimple ASCII to full Devanagari per Velthuis\' fonts.\n\nLastly, the text was converted to HTML in 1999 at sacred-texts.com using a C\nprogram; in June 2004 additional programming was performed to convert it to\nUnicode. N.B.: the following hymns for which Sanskrit transliterations are\navailable were apparently not translated by Griffith: 2:44-48, 3:63-69, and\n6:76-84.\n\n'
