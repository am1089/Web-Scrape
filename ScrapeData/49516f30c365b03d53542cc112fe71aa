The Gayatri is the breath (of Pra _g_ apati, the altar), the Ush\n_n_ ih the eye, the Anush _t_ ubh the voice, the B _ri_ hati the mind, the\nPa\xe1\xb9\x85kti the ear; the Trish _t_ ubh is that generative breath; and the _G_ agati\n\np. 328\n\nthat downward breathing;--these are the seven metres increasing by four\n(syllables) each 1, which are produced in Agni (the fire-altar).\n\n10:3:1:22\\. 'The Gayatri is the breath,'--thus, whatever power, whatever\nvigour there is in the breath that is this one thousand; and to the breath,\nindeed, this vigour belongs; for were the breath of him who builds it to pass\naway, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that\n(altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Gayatris.\n\n10:3:1:33\\. 'The Ush _n_ ih is the eye,'--thus, whatever power, whatever\nvigour there is in the eye that is this one thousand; and to the eye, indeed,\nthis vigour belongs, for were the eye-sight of him who builds it to pass away,\nthis fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar)\nbecomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Ush _n_ ihs.\n\n10:3:1:44\\. 'The Anush _t_ ubh is the voice,'--thus, whatever power, whatever\nvigour there is in the voice that is this one thousand; and to the voice,\nindeed, this vigour belongs, for were the voice of him who builds it to pass\naway, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that\n(altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Anush _t_ ubhs.\n\n10:3:1:55\\. 'The B _ri_ hati is the mind,'--thus, whatever power, whatever\nvigour there is in the mind that is this one thousand; and to the mind,\nindeed, this vigour belongs, for were the mind of him who builds it to pass\naway, this fire altar, assuredly,\n\np. 329\n\nwould not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to\ncontain) a thousand B _ri_ hatis.\n\n10:3:1:66\\. 'The Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti is the ear,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour\nthere is in the ear that is this one thousand; and to the ear, indeed, this\nvigour belongs, for were the power of hearing of him who builds it to pass\naway, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that\n(altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Pa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis.\n\n10:3:1:77\\. 'The Trish _t_ ubh is that generative (life-giving) breath,'--\nthus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in that breath, that is this\none thousand; and to that breath, indeed, this vigour belongs, for were that\nbreath of him who builds it to become disordered, this fire-altar, assuredly,\nwould not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to\ncontain) a thousand Trish _t_ ubhs.\n\n10:3:1:88\\. 'And the _G_ agati is that downward breathing,'--thus, whatever\npower, whatever vigour there is in that breathing, that is this one thousand;\nand to that breathing, indeed, this vigour belongs, for were that breathing of\nhim who builds it to become disordered, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not\nbe built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to include) a\nthousand _G_ agatis.\n\n10:3:1:99\\. Now, these seven metres which increase by four (syllables)\nsuccessively, and are firmly established in one another, are those seven vital\nairs 1 in man, firmly established in one another: thus, by\n\np. 330\n\nas much as the number of metres he utters has that (altar) of him who knows\nthis, prayers uttered upon it in metre after metre, or hymns chanted, or _s_\nastras recited, or (bricks) laid down upon it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[328:1](sbe4356.htm#fr_641) The Gayatri verse consists of twenty-four\nsyllables; and each of the following increases by four syllables, the _G_\nagati consisting of 4 \xc3\x97 12, or forty-eight syllables.\n\n[329:1](sbe4356.htm#fr_642) Viz. those enumerated in the preceding paragraphs,\nincluding those passing through the eye, ear, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 3, 2.
