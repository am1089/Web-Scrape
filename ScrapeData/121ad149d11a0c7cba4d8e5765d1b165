Proof by Ordeal.\n\n* 247. If no witness is forthcoming for either of the two litigant parties, he must test them through ordeals and oaths of every sort.\n\n* 248. 248 (Let him cause a Brahman to swear by) truth, (a Kshatriya) by his (horse or other) vehicle, and by his weapons, (a Vai _s_ ya) by his cows, seeds or gold and so on, (or all) by venerable deities or deified ancestors, by their pious gifts or meritorious deeds.\n\n249. 249 Where a heavy crime has been committed, the ruler shall administer one of the ordeals. In light cases, on the other hand, a virtuous king shall swear a man with (various) oaths.\n\n* 250. Thus have these oaths been proclaimed by Manu for trifling cases. In a suit concerning a heavy crime, divine test should be resorted to.\n\n251. 251 Holy Manu has ordained that five kinds of ordeals should be administered to those involved in a doubtful case (which has become the object of a lawsuit), especially if the matter under dispute is of a recondite nature.\n\n* 252. 252 The balance, fire, water, poison, and, fifthly, consecrated water, are the ordeals ordained for the purgation of high-minded persons.\n\np. 101\n\n* 253. 253 (Those ordeals) have been ordained here by Narada for the purpose of proving the innocence of criminals who are defendants in a lawsuit, (and) in order that right may be discerned from wrong.\n\n* 254. 254 During the rains let the (ordeal by) fire be administered. In the autumn season the balance is declared to be (the proper kind of ordeal). The (ordeal by) water should be applied in summer, and the (ordeal by) poison in the cold weather.\n\n* 255. 255 The distressed shall not be caused to undergo the (ordeal by) water, nor shall poison be given to the bilious, nor shall the ordeal by fire be administered to persons afflicted with white leprosy, or with blindness, or with bad nails.\n\n* 256. 256 An ordeal should never be administered to persons engaged in performing a vow, to those afflicted with a heavy calamity, to the diseased, to ascetics, or to women, if the dictates of justice are listened to.\n\n257. 257 Where no one declares himself ready to\n\np. 102\n\nundergo punishment, an ordeal cannot take place. An ordeal shall be\nadministered to litigants where there is reason for it, but not otherwise.\n\n258. 258 Therefore an intelligent, virtuous, righteous, and wise (king or chief judge) should abstain carefully from administering any one out of the (five) ordeals, unless both parties consent to it.\n\n* 259. 259 The ordeal by water must not take place in the cold weather, nor the ordeal by fire in the hot season, nor must the (ordeal by) poison be administered to any one during the rains, nor the (ordeal by) balance in stormy weather.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[100:248](sbe3326.htm#fr_292) In this rule are indicated the various oaths to\nbe administered according to the caste and individual character of the\noffender. A. Manu VIII, 114.\n\n[100:249](sbe3326.htm#fr_293) 249, 250. These two verses are intended to\nindicate the difference in point of applicability between an ordeal and an\noath. A.\n\n[100:251](sbe3326.htm#fr_294) Holy Manu has said that those against whom a\ncharge of an aggravated nature has been brought, shall have to undergo one out\nof the five ordeals, in order to clear themselves from suspicion, especially\nwhen a secret transgression is concerned. A.\n\n[100:252](sbe3326.htm#fr_295) In this paragraph the author proceeds to\nenumerate the five ordeals singly. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 95; Vish _n_ u\nIX, II.\n\n[101:253](sbe3326.htm#fr_296) The five ordeals have been proclaimed by the\ngreat sage Narada, for the justification of those impeached on account of\ntheir suspicious conduct, by showing where the wrong lies and where not. A.\n\n[101:254](sbe3326.htm#fr_297) The five ordeals should be administered, each of\nthem, at those very seasons, and not at any other season. A. Vish _n_ u IX,\n25, 28, 30.\n\n[101:255](sbe3326.htm#fr_298) 255, 256. Vish _n_ u IX, 23, 25, 27, 29.\n\n255\\. In the case of the persons here mentioned, the ordeals referred to\nshould be avoided, on grounds of disease and of incapacity to undergo them. A.\n\n[101:256](sbe3326.htm#fr_299) 'Persons engaged in performing a vow,' those who\nhave performed the ceremony initiatory to a Soma sacrifice. A.\n\n[101:257](sbe3326.htm#fr_300) An ordeal should not take place, unless there\nshould be a special reason for it, such as an accusation. Therefore an ordeal\nmust not be administered, unless there be a plaintiff who declares himself\nready to take the punishment on himself in case of defeat. p. 102 A. Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 96; Vish _n_ u IV, 20, 21. The reading na divya _m_ (for na\nvina?) seems wrong. Or translate, 'but there is no ordeal for plaintiffs.'\n\n[102:258](sbe3326.htm#fr_301) A king or chief-judge, who is endowed with the\nqualities here mentioned, should administer an ordeal with the full approval\nof both parties in a cause, but not otherwise. A.\n\n[102:259](sbe3326.htm#fr_302) The times or seasons here referred to should be\navoided in the case of the ordeal by water and of the other ordeals, because\nthey are illegal. A. Vish _n_ u IX, 24, 26, 28, 30.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 20. The Ordeal by Balance](sbe3327.htm)\n\n"
