 \nSo me, the consort dear and true  \nOf him who clings to virtue too,  \nThy hated touch shall ne'er defile,  \nBase tyrant lord of Lanka's isle.  \nCan the white swan who floats in pride  \nThrough lilies by her consort's side,  \nLook for one moment, as they pass,  \nOn the poor diver in the grass?  \nThis senseless body waits thy will.  \nTo torture, chain, to wound or kill.  \nI will not, King of giants, strive  \nTo keep this fleeting soul alive  \nBut never shall they join the name  \nOf Sita with reproach and shame.  \n   Thus as her breast with fury burned  \nHer bitter speech the dame returned.  \nSuch words of rage and scorn, the last  \nShe uttered, at the fiend she cast  \nHer taunting speech the giant heard,  \nAnd every hair with anger stired,  \nThen thus with fury in his eye  \nHe made in threats his fierce reply  \n'Hear Maithil lady, hear my speech  \n* to my words and ponder each  \n* thy head twelve months shall fly  \n\nAnd thou thy love wilt still deny,  \nMy cooks shall mince thy flesh with steel  \nAnd serve it for my morning meal.'  \n   Thus with terrific threats to her  \nSpake Ravan, cruel ravener.  \nMad with the rage her answer woke  \nHe called the fiendish train and spoke:  \n'Take her, ye Rakshas dames, who fright  \nWith hideous form and mien the sight,  \nWho make the flesh of men your food,--  \nAnd let her pride be soon subdued.'  \nHe spoke, and at his word the band  \nOf fiendish monsters raised each hand  \nIn reverence to the giant king,  \nAnd pressed round Sita in a ring.  \nRavan once more with stern behest  \nTo those she-fiends his speech addressed:  \nShaking the earth beneath his tread,  \nHe stamped his furious foot and said:  \n'To the As'oka garden bear  \nThe dame, and guard her safely there  \nUntil her stubborn pride be bent  \nBy mingled threat and blandishment.  \nSee that ye watch her well, and tame,  \nLike some she-elephant, the dame.'  \n   They led her to that garden where  \nThe sweetest flowers perfumed the air,  \nWhere bright trees bore each rarest fruit,  \nAnd birds, enamoured, ne'er were mute.  \nBowed down with terror and distress,  \nWatched by each cruel giantess,--  \nLike a poor solitary deer  \nWhen ravening tigresses are near,--  \nThe hapless lady lay distraught  \nLike some wild thing but newly caught,  \nAnd found no solace, no relief  \nFrom agonizing fear and grief;  \nNot for one moment could forget  \nEach terrifying word and threat,  \nOr the fierce eyes upon her set  \n   By those who watched around.  \nShe thought of Rama far away,  \nShe mourned for Lakshman as she lay  \nIn grief and terror and dismay  \n   Half fainting on the ground.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[296:1](ry254.htm#fr_507) See Book I Caato XXV\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LVII.: Sita Comforted.](ry255.htm)\n\n"
