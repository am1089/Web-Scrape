Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.\n\n1\\. The gods, O king, did not give to thee this (Cow) to eat. Do not, O\nprince, seek to devour the cow of the Brahmana, which is unfit to be eaten!  \n2\\. The prince, beguiled by dice, the wretched one who has lost as a stake his\nown person, he may, perchance, eat the cow of the Brahmana, (thinking), 'let\nme live to-day (if) not to-morrow'!  \n3\\. Enveloped (is she) in her skin, as an adder with evil poison; do not, O\nprince, (eat the cow) of the Brahmana: sapless, unfit to be eaten, is that\ncow!  \n4\\. Away does (the Brahmana) take regal power, destroys vigour; like fire\nwhich has caught does he burn away everything. He that regards the Brahmana as\nfit food drinks of the poison of the taimata-serpent.  \n5\\. He who thinks him (the Brahman) mild, and slays him, he who reviles the\ngods, lusts after wealth, without thought, in his heart Indra kindles a fire;\nhim both heaven and earth hate while he lives.  \n6\\. The Brahmana must not be encroached upon, any more than fire, by him that\nregards his own body! For Soma is his (the Brahmana's) heir, Indra protects\nhim from hostile plots.  \n7\\. He swallows her (the cow), bristling with a hundred hooks, (but) is unable\nto digest her, he, the fool who, devouring the food of the Brahmans, thinks,\n'I am eating a luscious (morsel).'  \n8\\. (The Brahman's) tongue turns into a bow. string, his voice into the neck\nof an arrow; his windpipe, his teeth are bedaubed with holy fire: with these\nthe Brahman strikes those who revile the gods, by means of bows that have the\nstrength to reach the heart, discharged by the gods.  \n9\\. The Brahmanas have sharp arrows, are armed with missiles, the arrow whi ch\nthey hurl goes not in vain; pursuing him with their holy fire and their wrath,\neven from afar, do they pierce him.  \n10\\. They who ruled over a thousand, and were themselves ten hundred, the\nVaitahavya, when they devoured the cow of the Brahmana, perished.  \n11\\. The cow herself, when slaughtered, came down upon the Vaitahavyas. who\nhad roasted for themselves the last she-goat of Kesaraprabandha.  \n12\\. The one hundred and one persons whom the earth did cast off, because they\nhad injured the offspring of a Brahmana, were ruined irretrievably.  \n13\\. As a reviler of the gods does he live among mortals, having swallowed\npoison, he becomes more bone (than flesh). He that injureth a Brahmana, whose\nkin are the gods, does not reach heaven by the road of the Fathers.  \n14\\. Agni is called our guide, Soma our heir, Indra slays those who curse\n(us): that the strong (sages) know.  \n15\\. Like a poisoned arrow, O king, like -an adder, O lord of cattle, is the\nterrible arrow of the Brahmana: with that he smites those who revile (the\ngods).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 19.
