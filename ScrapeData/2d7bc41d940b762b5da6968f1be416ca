We,\nindeed, know that from time immemorial in every age and in every country there\nhave arisen among the different nations persons who could read the thoughts of\nothers, who could foresee and could prophesy that which afterwards came to\npass; but most of these people did not understand the causes of their own\npeculiar\n\np. 28\n\ngifts, and tried to explain them by attributing them to the influence of\nexternal Beings, whom they called by various names--gods, angels, good or evil\nspirits.\n\nSome among them even fancied that they were especially chosen to be the\ninstruments of these higher powers and sought to be worshipped as the elect of\nGod or of their particular deity, just as the leaders of certain sects in this\ncountry to-day desire to be adored by their followers. In some instances,\nthose who possessed these unusual powers were looked upon as divine\nexceptions, as Jesus by the Christians, Mahomet by the Mahometans, and Buddha\nby the Buddhists. Others again were condemned as sorcerers or witches, and the\nfear aroused by such persecutions led to the secret practice of divers methods\nwhich resulted in still further extraordinary manifestations.\n\np. 29\n\nThese methods were never written down, but were passed orally from the master\nto the disciple, who in turn carefully guarded them as sacred mysteries. This\nis the reason why among ancient nations there grew up so many secret\nsocieties, the object of which was to develop certain powers through various\nkinds of discipline and practices. The Egyptians, the Essenes, Gnostics,\nManicheans, Neo-Platonists, and the Christian mystics of the middle ages all\nhad their secret organizations, and some of them still exist, as, for example,\nthe Masonic Lodge. None of the members of these societies ever gave out their\nsecret instructions, nor did they write any books offering a logical or\nscientific explanation of their practices. Therefore, while there were some\namong them who advanced far in the attainment of higher powers, the\n\np. 30\n\nunusual manifestations resulting therefrom were never understood by Western\nnations, neither were they generalized into a system or science.\n\nIn ancient India, on the contrary, as there was no fear of persecution, the\ncase was altogether different. Every Hindu was obliged, as a part of his\nreligious duty, to develop through daily practice certain powers and to strive\nto attain to the realization of higher truths. In the streets, on the market-\nplace, in the courts, and on the battle-field were many who had not only\nreached such realization, but who had carefully classified their experiences\nand discovered those laws which govern our higher nature and upon which was\ngradually built up the profound Science of Yoga.\n\nThus we see that this science, like all others, was based on experience; while\nthe method used in it was the same as that\n\np. 31\n\nemployed by modern science in making all its discoveries of natural law--the\nmethod of observation and experiment. This method is regarded in the West as a\ndistinctly modern innovation, but as a matter of fact it was adopted in India\nin very ancient times by the "Rishis," or Seers of Truth. Through the process\nof close observation and constant experiment they discovered the finer forces\nof nature, as also the laws that govern our physical, mental, and spiritual\nbeing. The truths thus gained through their own experience and investigations,\nthey wrote down in books, preached in public, and expounded to their pupils.\nBefore, however, they affirmed anything about the nature of the soul or God,\nthey had realized it. Before they asked a disciple to practice anything they\nhad practiced it themselves, and had obtained definite results from that\npractice.\n\np. 32\n\nIn this way, as the outcome of ages of research in the realms of nature,\ncarried on by a succession of earnest seekers after light, there grew up in\nIndia various systems of science, philosophy, psychology, metaphysics, and\nreligion, both speculative and practical, which were grouped under the one\ncommon name, "Aryan Religion." The term "religion" was used to include all,\nbecause at no epoch in India has religion been separated from these different\nbranches or from the general conduct of every-day existence; and the methods\nby which these scientific truths were applied in the daily life of an\nindividual to further his spiritual development, were called by the general\nterm "Yoga."\n\n"Yoga" is a Sanskrit word commonly used to signify the practical side of\nreligion; and the first concern of the training for which it stands, is to\nenforce proper\n\np. 33\n\nobedience to the laws of our moral and physical nature, upon which depend the\nattainment of perfect health and of moral and spiritual perfection. In Western\ncountries the word has been grossly misunderstood and misused by many writers,\nwho have employed it in the sense of jugglery, hypnotism, trickery, and fraud.\nWhenever people hear the word "Yogi," which signifies one who practices Yoga,\nthey think of some kind of juggler, or charlatan, or identify him with a fakir\nor one who practices black magic. The Theosophists have been more or less\nresponsible for this abuse of the term; but those who have studied the Sacred\nBooks of India, as, for instance, the Bhagavad Gita or Song Celestial, as Sir\nEdwin Arnold calls it in his translation, will remember that each chapter of\nthat Celestial Song is devoted to some kind of "Yoga," or method of realizing\nthe Ultimate\n\np. 34\n\n[paragraph continues] Truth and of attaining the highest wisdom; and that a\n"Yogi" is one who through various practices reaches the highest ideal of\nreligion. This highest ideal, according to the Bhagavad Gita, is the union of\nthe individual soul with the Universal Spirit.\n\nHindu writers, however, have used the word "Yoga" in various other senses. I\nwill mention a few of them in order to give some conception of the vastness of\nthe field covered by this term. First, "Yoga" means the union of two external\nobjects. Second, the mixing of one thing with another. Third, the\ninterrelation of the causes which produce a common effect. Fourth, the orderly\nequipment of a soldier or of any person in any profession. Fifth, the\napplication, discrimination, and reasoning that is necessary for the discovery\nof a certain truth. Sixth, that power of sound\n\np. 35\n\nwhich makes it convey a specific idea. Seventh, the preservation of what one\npossesses. Eighth, the transformation of one thing into another. Ninth, the\nunion of one soul with another or with the universal Spirit. Tenth, the\nflowing of a thought current towards an object. Eleventh, the restraint of all\nthought action through concentration and meditation. Thus we see how many\ndifferent branches of art, science, psychology, philosophy, and religion are\nincluded in the various definitions of this one word. It seems, indeed, in its\nscope and range to take in every department of nature. If, however, we\nconsider the literal meaning of the word, we shall more easily understand why\nit is so all-inclusive.\n\nIt is derived from the Sanskrit root "Yuj," which means to join. The English\nword "yoke" also comes from the\n\np. 36\n\nsame root. Originally the literal signification of the two words was almost\nthe same. The root-verb "Yuj" signifies to join oneself to something, or to\nharness oneself for some task. Thus in its primary meaning it conveys the same\nidea of preparing for hard work as the common English expressions "to go into\nharness," or "to buckle to." The effort required is mental or physical,\naccording to the object in view. If the object be the acquirement of perfect\nhealth or longevity, then the effort of both mind and body to accomplish this\nthrough certain practices is called "Yoga." So is it again if the object be\nthe development of psychic powers. The same word is used likewise to indicate\nthe mental training necessary for the attainment of self-control, of the union\nof the individual soul with God, of divine communion or of spiritual\nperfection. Volumes upon volumes\n\np. 37\n\nhave been written in India describing the different branches and methods of\nthis applied science of "Yoga," and the various ideals that can be attained\nthrough its practice; also what qualifications fit a beginner for undertaking\nany of these methods, what stages he must pass through in order to reach the\ngoal, what obstacles stand in the way, and how they can be overcome.\n\nPatience and perseverance are absolutely necessary for any one who desires to\nenter upon the path of Yoga; those who are not patient cannot hope to arrive\nat true realization. Those, again, who take it up out of curiosity or through\nan impulse of temporary enthusiasm, must not expect to get results, and must\nnot blame the teacher for their failure to do so, since the fault is entirely\ntheir own. The same teachings, when carried out with understanding\n\np. 38\n\nand in the right spirit, will bring wonderful results. They will only come,\nhowever, to the student who follows strictly the instructions of a living\nmaster, who will direct him in the practice of both physical and mental\nexercises.\n\nAspirants to the study of Yoga can be divided into three classes: First, those\nwho are born Yogis. There are some who, having practiced Yoga in a previous\nincarnation, come here as awakened souls, and as such manifest remarkable\npowers from their very childhood. Their natural tendency is to lead a pure\nlife, for right living and right thinking are their sole concern, and they\npossess wonderful powers of self-control and of concentration. Sense pleasures\nand those things which fascinate the ordinary mind have no charm for them.\nEven when they are surrounded by all the comforts of life and have every\nmaterial\n\np. 39\n\nresource at their command, they yet feel like strangers in a strange land. Few\nthere are who can understand properly the mental condition of these\ncharacters. Physicians may be brought to them, but medical treatment may only\nmake them worse; the writer knows of cases where harm has been done in this\nway. By the law of attraction, however, they are bound to be drawn sooner or\nlater into the companionship of some Yogi. Here they find exactly what their\ninner nature has been craving, and at once they feel happy and at home. The\ninstructions of the Yogi appeal to their minds; they begin the practice of\nYoga under his direction, and proving easy and natural to them, they soon\nobtain excellent results. Thus from youth they take up the thread of the\npractice at the very point where they dropped it in their past existence; and\nthrough a firm determination\n\np. 40\n\nto overcome all obstacles in their way, they progress rapidly and gradually\nattain to the highest ideal of spiritual life. Nothing in the world can\nprevent their onward march, so intense and strong is their longing for\nrealization.\n\nThe second class includes those who are born as half-awakened souls. In need\nof further experience, they go through various paths without finding the right\none. They take each new step tentatively, and in this constant experimenting,\nthey waste a great deal of energy and a large portion of their lives. If such\npartially awakened souls, following out a tendency created in their previous\nexistence, have the good fortune to come in contact with a Yogi and take up\nthe practice of Yoga, they may, through perseverance and earnestness, achieve\nmuch in this life, although they will necessarily advance more slowly in the\n\np. 41\n\npath of spirituality than those who belong to the first class.\n\nIn the third class are to be found all those unawakened souls who begin their\nsearch after Truth and the practice of Yoga for the first time in this life.\nEven from childhood they are irresistibly drawn towards sense objects and\nsense pleasures; and if they take up the practice of Yoga, they find great\ndifficulty in following its teachings and meet numerous obstacles along the\nway. Their environment is not favorable for the practice, and even when they\ntry, they cannot easily conquer it. Their health is not good, their mind is\nscattered, and they suffer from various kinds of disease and mental\ndisturbance. They also lack determination, find it well-nigh impossible to\ncontrol the senses, and have to fight hard to adjust their mode of living to\nthe new requirements. With so much\n\np. 42\n\nto contend against they naturally obtain but small results even after long\npractice. If, however, such persons can persevere and strengthen their wills\nthrough a slow and regular practice of Hatha Yoga, struggling manfully to\novercome the many obstacles in their way by the practice of breathing\nexercises and by following the directions of a competent teacher, who\nunderstands them, they may in this life be able to control in a large measure\ntheir physical health and acquire a certain amount of Yoga power. Hatha Yoga\nis especially useful for this class of aspirants. Through the practice of\nbreathing exercises they will gradually gain control over their bodies, and\nwill, in course of time, be prepared for the study of Raja Yoga, which will\narouse the powers latent in their souls.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Hatha Yoga](hby05.htm)\n\n'
