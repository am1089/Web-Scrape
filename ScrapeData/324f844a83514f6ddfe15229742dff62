Psychic and spiritual powers may be inborn, or they may be gained by\nthe use of drugs, or by incantations, or by fervour, or by Meditation.\n\nSpiritual powers have been enumerated and described in the preceding sections.\nThey are the normal powers of the spiritual man, the antetype, the divine\nedition, of the powers of the natural man. Through these powers, the spiritual\nman stands, sees, hears, speaks, in the spiritual world, as the physical man\nstands, sees, hears, speaks in the natural world.\n\nThere is a counterfeit presentment of the spiritual man, in the world of\ndreams, a shadow lord of shadows, who has his own dreamy powers of vision, of\nhearing, of movement; he has left the natural without reaching the spiritual.\nHe has set forth from the shore, but has not gained the further verge of the\nriver. He is borne along by the stream, with no foothold on either shore.\nLeaving the actual, he has fallen short of the real, caught in the limbo of\nvanities and delusions. The cause of this aberrant phantasm is always the\nworship of a false, vain self, the lord of dreams, within one's own breast.\nThis is the psychic man, lord of delusive and bewildering psychic powers.\n\nSpiritual powers, like intellectual or artistic gifts, may be inborn: the\nfruit, that is, of seeds planted and reared with toil in a former birth. So\nalso the powers of the psychic man may be inborn, a delusive harvest from\nseeds of delusion.\n\nPsychical powers may be gained by drugs, as poverty, shame, debasement may be\ngained by the self-same drugs. In their action, they are baneful, cutting the\nman off from consciousness of the restraining power of his divine nature, so\nthat his forces break forth exuberant, like the laughter of drunkards, and he\nsees and hears things delusive. While sinking, he believes that he has risen;\ngrowing weaker, he thinks himself full of strength; beholding illusions, he\ntakes them to be true. Such are the powers gained by drugs; they are wholly\npsychic, since the real powers, the spiritual, can never be so gained.\n\nIncantations are affirmations of half-truths concerning spirit and matter,\nwhat is and what is not, which work upon the mind and slowly build up a wraith\nof powers and a delusive well-being. These, too, are of the psychic realm of\ndreams.\n\nLastly, there are the true powers of the spiritual man, built up and realized\nin Meditation, through reverent obedience to spiritual law, to the pure\nconditions of being, in the divine realm.\n\n### 2\\. The transfer of powers from one venture to another comes through the\nflow of the natural creative forces.\n\nHere, if we can perceive it, is the whole secret of spiritual birth, growth\nand life Spiritual being, like all being, is but an expression of the Self, of\nthe inherent power and being of Atma. Inherent in the Self are consciousness\nand will, which have, as their lordly heritage, the wide sweep of the universe\nthroughout eternity, for the Self is one with the Eternal. And the\nconsciousness of the Self may make itself manifest as seeing, hearing,\ntasting, feeling, or whatsoever perceptive powers there may be, just as the\nwhite sunlight may divide into many-coloured rays. So may the will of the Self\nmanifest itself in the uttering of words, or in handling, or in moving, and\nwhatever powers of action there are throughout the seven worlds. Where the\nSelf is, there will its powers be. It is but a question of the vesture through\nwhich these powers shall shine forth. And wherever the consciousness and\ndesire of the ever-creative Self are fixed, there will a vesture be built up;\nwhere the heart is, there will the treasure be also.\n\nSince through ages the desire of the Self has been toward the natural world,\nwherein the Self sought to mirror himself that he might know himself,\ntherefore a vesture of natural elements came into being, through which\nblossomed forth the Self's powers of perceiving and of will: the power to see,\nto hear, to speak, to walk, to handle; and when the Self, thus come to self-\nconsciousness, and, with it, to a knowledge of his imprisonment, shall set his\ndesire on the divine and real world, and raise his consciousness thereto, the\nspiritual vesture shall be built up for him there, with its expression of his\ninherent powers. Nor will migration thither be difficult for the Self, since\nthe divine is no strange or foreign land for him, but the house of his home,\nwhere he dwells from everlasting.\n\n### 3\\. The apparent, immediate cause is not the true cause of the creative\nnature-powers; but, like the husbandman in his field, it takes obstacles away.\n\nThe husbandman tills his field, breaking up the clods of earth into fine\nmould, penetrable to air and rain; he sows his seed, carefully covering it,\nfor fear of birds and the wind; he waters the seed-laden earth, turning the\nlittle rills from the irrigation tank now this way and that, removing\nobstacles from the channels, until the even How of water vitalizes the whole\nfield. And so the plants germinate and grow, first the blade, then the ear,\nthen the full corn in the ear. But it is not the husbandman who makes them\ngrow. It is, first, the miraculous plasmic power in the grain of seed, which\nbrings forth after its kind; then the alchemy of sunlight which, in presence\nof the green colouring matter of the leaves, gathers hydrogen from the water\nand carbon from the gases in the air, and mingles them in the hydro-carbons of\nplant growth; and, finally, the wholly occult vital powers of the plant\nitself, stored up through ages, and flowing down from the primal sources of\nlife. The husbandman but removes the obstacles. He plants and waters, but God\ngives the increase.\n\nSo with the finer husbandman of diviner fields. He tills and sows, but the\ngrowth of the spiritual man comes through the surge and flow of divine,\ncreative forces and powers. Here, again, God gives the increase. The divine\nSelf puts forth, for the manifestation of its powers, a new and finer vesture,\nthe body of the spiritual man.\n\n### 4\\. Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston\nof the feeling of selfhood.\n\nThe Self, says a great Teacher, in turn attributes itself to three vestures:\nfirst, to the physical body, then to the finer body, and thirdly to the causal\nbody. Finally it stands forth radiant, luminous, joyous, as the Self.\n\nWhen the Self attributes itself to the physical body, there arise the states\nof bodily consciousness, built up about the physical self.\n\nWhen the Self, breaking through this first illusion, begins to see and feel\nitself in the finer body, to find selfhood there, then the states of\nconsciousness of the finer body come into being; or, to speak exactly, the\nfiner body and its states of consciousness arise and grow together.\n\nBut the Self must not dwell permanently there. It must learn to find itself in\nthe causal body, to build up the wide and luminous fields of consciousness\nthat belong to that.\n\nNor must it dwell forever there, for there remains the fourth state, the\ndivine, with its own splendour and everlastingness.\n\nIt is all a question of the states of consciousness; all a question of raising\nthe sense of selfhood, until it dwells forever in the Eternal.\n\n### 5\\. In the different fields of manifestation, the Consciousness, though\none, is the elective cause of many states of consciousness.\n\nHere is the splendid teaching of oneness that lies at the heart of the Eastern\nwisdom. Consciousness is ultimately One, everywhere and forever. The Eternal,\nthe Father, is the One Self of All Beings. And so, in each individual who is\nbut a facet of that Self, Consciousness is One. Whether it breaks through as\nthe dull fire of physical life, or the murky flame of the psychic and\npassional, or the radiance of the spiritual man, or the full glory of the\nDivine, it is ever the Light, naught but the Light. The one Consciousness is\nthe effective cause of all states of consciousness, on every plane.\n\n### 6\\. Among states of consciousness, that which is born of Contemplation is\nfree from the seed of future sorrow.\n\nWhere the consciousness breaks forth in the physical body, and the full play\nof bodily life begins, its progression carries with it inevitable limitations.\nBirth involves death. Meetings have their partings. Hunger alternates with\nsatiety. Age follows on the heels of youth. So do the states of consciousness\nrun along the circle of birth and death.\n\nWith the psychic, the alternation between prize and penalty is swifter. Hope\nhas its shadow of fear, or it is no hope. Exclusive love is tortured by\njealousy. Pleasure passes through deadness into pain. Pain's surcease brings\npleasure back again. So here, too, the states of consciousness run their\ncircle. In all psychic states there is egotism, which, indeed, is the very\nessence of the psychic; and where there is egotism there is ever the seed of\nfuture sorrow. Desire carries bondage in its womb.\n\nBut where the pure spiritual consciousness begins, free from self and stain,\nthe ancient law of retaliation ceases; the penalty of sorrow lapses and is no\nmore imposed. The soul now passes, no longer from sorrow to sorrow, but from\nglory to glory. Its growth and splendour have no limit. The good passes to\nbetter, best.\n\n### 7\\. The works of followers after Union make neither for bright pleasure\nnor for dark pain The works of others make for pleasure or pain, or a mingling\nof these.\n\nThe man of desire wins from his works the reward of pleasure, or incurs the\npenalty of pain; or, as so often happens in life, his guerdon, like the\npassionate mood of the lover, is part pleasure and part pain. Works done with\nself-seeking bear within them the seeds of future sorrow; conversely,\naccording to the proverb, present pain is future gain.\n\nBut, for him who has gone beyond desire, whose desire is set on the Eternal,\nneither pain to be avoided nor pleasure to be gained inspires his work. He\nfears no hell and desires no heaven. His one desire is, to know the will of\nthe Father and finish His work. He comes directly in line with the divine\nWill, and works cleanly and immediately, without longing or fear. His heart\ndwells in the Eternal; all his desires are set on the Eternal.\n\n### 8\\. From the force inherent in works comes the manifestation of those\ndynamic mind images which are conformable to the ripening out of each of these\nworks.\n\nWe are now to consider the general mechanism of Karma, in order that we may\npass on to the consideration of him who is free from Karma. Karma, indeed, is\nthe concern of the personal man, of his bondage or freedom. It is the\nsuccession of the forces which built up the personal man, reproducing\nthemselves in one personality after another.\n\nNow let us take an imaginary case, to see how these forces may work out. Let\nus think of a man, with murderous intent in his heart, striking with a dagger\nat his enemy. He makes a red wound in his victim's breast; at the same instant\nhe paints, in his own mind, a picture of that wound: a picture dynamic with\nall the fierce will-power he has put into his murderous blow. In other words\nhe has made a deep wound in his own psychic body; and, when he comes to be\nborn again, that body will become his outermost vesture, upon which, with its\nwound still there, bodily tissue will be built up. So the man will be born\nmaimed, or with the predisposition to some mortal injury; he is unguarded at\nthat point, and any trifling accidental blow will pierce the broken Joints of\nhis psychic armour. Thus do the dynamic mind-images manifest themselves,\ncoming to the surface, so that works done in the past may ripen and come to\nfruition.\n\n### 9\\. Works separated by different nature, or place, or time, are brought\ntogether by the correspondence between memory and dynamic impression.\n\nJust as, in the ripening out of mind-images into bodily conditions, the effect\nis brought about by the ray of creative force sent down by the Self, somewhat\nas the light of the magic lantern projects the details of a picture on the\nscreen, revealing the hidden, and making secret things palpable and visible,\nso does this divine ray exercise a selective power on the dynamic mind-images,\nbringing together into one day of life the seeds gathered from many days. The\nmemory constantly exemplifies this power; a passage of poetry will call up in\nthe mind like passages of many poets, read at different times. So a prayer may\ncall up many prayers.\n\nIn like manner, the same over-ruling selective power, which is a ray of the\nHigher Self, gathers together from different births and times and places those\nmind-images which are conformable, and may be grouped in the frame of a single\nlife or a single event. Through this grouping, visible bodily conditions or\noutward circumstances are brought about, and by these the soul is taught and\ntrained.\n\nJust as the dynamic mind-images of desire ripen out in bodily conditions and\ncircumstances, so the far more dynamic powers of aspiration, wherein the soul\nreaches toward the Eternal, have their fruition in a finer world, building the\nvesture of the spiritual man.\n\n### 10\\. The series of dynamic mind-images is beginningless, because Desire is\neverlasting.\n\nThe whole series of dynamic mind-images, which make up the entire history of\nthe personal man, is a part of the mechanism which the Self employs, to mirror\nitself in a reflection, to embody its powers in an outward form, to the end of\nself-expression, self-realization, self-knowledge. Therefore the initial\nimpulse behind these dynamic mind-images comes from the Self and is the\ndescending ray of the Self; so that it cannot be said that there is any first\nmember of the series of images, from which the rest arose. The impulse is\nbeginningless, since it comes from the Self, which is from everlasting. Desire\nis not to cease; it is to turn to the Eternal, and so become aspiration.\n\n### 11\\. Since the dynamic mind-images are held together by impulses of\ndesire, by the wish for personal reward, by the substratum of mental habit, by\nthe support of outer things desired; therefore, when these cease, the self\nreproduction of dynamic mind-images ceases.\n\nWe are still concerned with the personal life in its bodily vesture, and with\nthe process whereby the forces which have upheld it are gradually transferred\nto the life of the spiritual man, and build up for him his finer vesture in a\nfiner world.\n\nHow is the current to be changed? How is the flow of self-reproductive mind-\nimages, which have built the conditions of life after life in this world of\nbondage, to be checked, that the time of imprisonment may come to an end, the\nday of liberation dawn?\n\nThe answer is given in the Sutra just translated. The driving-force is\nwithdrawn and directed to the upbuilding of the spiritual body.\n\nWhen the building impulses and forces are withdrawn, the tendency to manifest\na new psychical body, a new body of bondage, ceases with them.\n\n### 12\\. The difference between that which is past and that which is not yet\ncome, according to their natures, depends on the difference of phase of their\nproperties.\n\nHere we come to a high and difficult matter, which has always been held to be\nof great moment in the Eastern wisdom: the thought that the division of time\ninto past, present and future is, in great measure, an illusion; that past,\npresent, future all dwell together in the eternal Now.\n\nThe discernment of this truth has been held to be so necessarily a part of\nwisdom, that one of the names of the Enlightened is: 'he who has passed beyond\nthe three times: past, present, future.'\n\nSo the Western Master said: 'Before Abraham was, I am'; and again, 'I am with\nyou always, unto the end of the world'; using the eternal present for past and\nfuture alike. With the same purpose, the Master speaks of himself as 'the\nalpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.'\n\nAnd a Master of our own days writes: 'I feel even irritated at having to use\nthese three clumsy words--past, present, and future. Miserable concepts of the\nobjective phases of the subjective whole, they are about as ill adapted for\nthe purpose, as an axe for fine carving.'\n\nIn the eternal Now, both past and future are consummated.\n\nBjorklund, the Swedish philosopher, has well stated the same truth:\n\n'Neither past nor future can exist to God; He lives undividedly, without\nlimitations, and needs not, as man, to plot out his existence in a series of\nmoments. Eternity then is not identical with unending time; it is a different\nform of existence, related to time as the perfect to the imperfect. Man as an\nentity for himself must have the natural limitations for the part. Conceived\nby God, man is eternal in the divine sense, but conceived by himself, man's\neternal life is clothed in the limitations we call time. The eternal is a\nconstant present without beginning or end, without past or future.'\n\n### 13\\. These properties, whether manifest or latent, are of the nature of\nthe Three Potencies.\n\nThe Three Potencies are the three manifested modifications of the one primal\nmaterial, which stands opposite to perceiving consciousness. These Three\nPotencies are called Substance, Force, Darkness; or viewed rather for their\nmoral colouring, Goodness, Passion, Inertness. Every material manifestation is\na projection of substance into the empty space of darkness. Every mental state\nis either good, or passional, or inert. So, whether subjective or objective,\nlatent or manifest, all things that present themselves to the perceiving\nconsciousness are compounded of these three. This is a fundamental doctrine of\nthe Sankhya system.\n\n### 14\\. The external manifestation of an object takes place when the\ntransformations ore in the same phase.\n\nWe should be inclined to express the same law by saying, for example, that a\nsound is audible, when it consists of vibrations within the compass of the\nauditory nerve; that an object is visible, when either directly or by\nreflection, it sends forth luminiferous vibrations within the compass of the\nretina and the optic nerve. Vibrations below or above that compass make no\nimpression at all, and the object remains invisible; as, for example, a kettle\nof boiling water in a dark room, though the kettle is sending forth heat\nvibrations closely akin to light.\n\nSo, when the vibrations of the object and those of the perceptive power are in\nthe same phase, the external manifestation of the object takes place.\n\nThere seems to be a further suggestion that the appearance of an object in the\n'present,' or its remaining hid in the 'past,' or 'future,' is likewise a\nquestion of phase, and, just as the range of vibrations perceived might be\nincreased by the development of finer senses, so the perception of things\npast, and things to come, may be easy from a higher point of view.\n\n### 15\\. The paths of material things and of states of consciousness are\ndistinct, as is manifest from the fact that the same object may produce\ndifferent impressions in different minds.\n\nHaving shown that our bodily condition and circumstances depend on Karma,\nwhile Karma depends on perception and will, the sage recognizes the fact that\nfrom this may be drawn the false deduction that material things are in no wise\ndifferent from states of mind. The same thought has occurred, and still\noccurs, to all philosophers; and, by various reasonings, they all come to the\nsame wise conclusion; that the material world is not made by the mood of any\nhuman mind, but is rather the manifestation of the totality of invisible\nBeing, whether we call this Mahat, with the ancients, or Ether, with the\nmoderns.\n\n### 16\\. Nor do material objects defend upon a single mind, for how could they\nremain objective to others, if that mind ceased to think of them?\n\nThis is but a further development of the thought of the preceding Sutra,\ncarrying on the thought that, while the universe is spiritual, yet its\nmaterial expression is ordered, consistent, ruled by law, not subject to the\nwhims or affirmations of a single mind. Unwelcome material things may be\nescaped by spiritual growth, by rising to a realm above them, and not by\ndenying their existence on their own plane. So that our system is neither\nmaterialistic, nor idealistic in the extreme sense, but rather intuitional and\nspiritual, holding that matter is the manifestation of spirit as a whole, a\nreflection or externalization of spirit, and, like spirit, everywhere obedient\nto law. The path of liberation is not through denial of matter but through\ndenial of the wills of self, through obedience, and that aspiration which\nbuilds the vesture of the spiritual man.\n\n### 17\\. An object is perceived, or not perceived, according as the mind is,\nor is not, tinged with the colour of the object.\n\nThe simplest manifestation of this is the matter of attention. Our minds\napprehend what they wish to apprehend; all else passes unnoticed, or, on the\nother hand, we perceive what we resent, as, for example, the noise of a\npassing train; while others, used to the sound, do not notice it at all.\n\nBut the deeper meaning is, that out of the vast totality of objects ever\npresent in the universe, the mind perceives only those which conform to the\nhue of its Karma. The rest remain unseen, even though close at hand.\n\nThis spiritual law has been well expressed by Emerson:\n\n'Through solidest eternal things the man finds his road as if they did not\nsubsist, and does not once suspect their being. As soon as he needs a new\nobject, suddenly he beholds it, and no longer attempts to pass through it, but\ntakes another way. When he has exhausted for the time the nourishment to be\ndrawn from any one person or thing, that object is withdrawn from his\nobservation, and though still in his immediate neighbourhood, he does not\nsuspect its presence. Nothing is dead. Men feign themselves dead, and endure\nmock funerals and mournful obituaries, and there they stand looking out of the\nwindow, sound and well, in some new and strange disguise. Jesus is not dead,\nhe is very well alive: nor John, nor Paul, nor Mahomet, nor Aristotle; at\ntimes we believe we have seen them all, and could easily tell the names under\nwhich they go.'\n\n### 18\\. The movements of the psychic nature are perpetually objects of\nperception, since the Spiritual Man, who is the lord of them, remains\nunchanging.\n\nHere is teaching of the utmost import, both for understanding and for\npractice.\n\nTo the psychic nature belong all the ebb and flow of emotion, all hoping and\nfearing, desire and hate: the things that make the multitude of men and women\ndeem themselves happy or miserable. To it also belong the measuring and\ncomparing, the doubt and questioning, which, for the same multitude, make up\nmental life. So that there results the emotion-soaked personality, with its\ndark and narrow view of life: the shivering, terror driven personality that is\nlife itself for all but all of mankind.\n\nYet the personality is not the true man, not the living soul at all, but only\na spectacle which the true man observes. Let us under stand this, therefore,\nand draw ourselves up inwardly to the height of the Spiritual Man, who,\nstanding in the quiet light of the Eternal, looks down serene upon this\nturmoil of the outer life.\n\nOne first masters the personality, the 'mind,' by thus looking down on it from\nabove, from within; by steadily watching its ebb and flow, as objective,\noutward, and therefore not the real Self. This standing back is the first\nstep, detachment. The second, to maintain the vantage-ground thus gained, is\nrecollection.\n\n### 19\\. The Mind is not self-luminous, since it can be seen as an object.\n\nThis is a further step toward overthrowing the tyranny of the 'mind': the\npsychic nature of emotion and mental measuring. This psychic self, the\npersonality, claims to be absolute, asserting that life is for it and through\nit; it seeks to impose on the whole being of man its narrow, materialistic,\nfaithless view of life and the universe; it would clip the wings of the\nsoaring Soul. But the Soul dethrones the tyrant, by perceiving and steadily\naffirming that the psychic self is no true self at all, not self-luminous, but\nonly an object of observation, watched by the serene eyes of the Spiritual\nMan.\n\n### 20\\. Nor could the Mind at the same time know itself and things external\nto it.\n\nThe truth is that the 'mind' knows neither external things nor itself. Its\nmeasuring and analyzing, its hoping and fearing, hating and desiring, never\ngive it a true measure of life, nor any sense of real values. Ceaselessly\nactive, it never really attains to knowledge; or, if we admit its knowledge,\nit ever falls short of wisdom, which comes only through intuition, the vision\nof the Spiritual Man.\n\nLife cannot be known by the 'mind,' its secrets cannot be learned through the\n'mind.' The proof is, the ceaseless strife and contradiction of opinion among\nthose who trust in the mind. Much less can the 'mind' know itself, the more\nso, because it is pervaded by the illusion that it truly knows, truly is.\n\nTrue knowledge of the 'mind' comes, first, when the Spiritual Man, arising,\nstands detached, regarding the 'mind' from above, with quiet eyes, and seeing\nit for the tangled web of psychic forces that it truly is. But the truth is\ndivined long before it is clearly seen, and then begins the long battle of the\n'mind,' against the Real, the 'mind' fighting doggedly, craftily, for its\nsupremacy.\n\n### 21\\. If the Mind be thought of as seen by another more inward Mind, then\nthere would be an endless series of perceiving Minds, and a confusion of\nmemories.\n\nOne of the expedients by which the 'mind' seeks to deny and thwart the Soul,\nwhen it feels that it is beginning to be circumvented and seen through, is to\nassert that this seeing is the work of a part of itself, one part observing\nthe other, and thus leaving no need nor place for the Spiritual Man.\n\nTo this strategy the argument is opposed by our philosopher, that this would\nbe no true solution, but only a postponement of the solution. For we should\nhave to find yet another part of the mind to view the first observing part,\nand then another to observe this, and so on, endlessly.\n\nThe true solution is, that the Spiritual Man looks down upon the psychic\nnature, and observes it; when he views the psychic pictures gallery, this is\n'memory,' which would be a hopeless, inextricable confusion, if we thought of\none part of the 'mind,' with its memories, viewing another part, with memories\nof its own.\n\nThe solution of the mystery lies not in the 'mind' but beyond it, in the\nluminous life of the risen Lord, the Spiritual Man.\n\n### 22\\. When the psychical nature takes on the form of the spiritual\nintelligence, by reflecting it, then the Self becomes conscious of its own\nspiritual intelligence.\n\nWe are considering a stage of spiritual life at which the psychical nature has\nbeen cleansed and purified. Formerly, it reflected in its plastic substance\nthe images of the earthy; purified now, it reflects the image of the heavenly,\ngiving the spiritual intelligence a visible form. The Self, beholding that\nvisible form, in which its spiritual intelligence has, as it were, taken\npalpable shape, thereby reaches self-recognition, self-comprehension. The Self\nsees itself in this mirror, and thus becomes not only conscious, but self-\nconscious. This is, from one point of view, the purpose of the whole\nevolutionary process.\n\n### 23\\. The psychic nature, taking on the colour of the Seer and of things\nseen, leads to the perception of all objects.\n\nIn the unregenerate man, the psychic nature is saturated with images of\nmaterial things, of things seen, or heard, or tasted, or felt; and this web of\ndynamic images forms the ordinary material and driving power of life. The\nsensation of sweet things tasted clamours to be renewed, and drives the man\ninto effort to obtain its renewal; so he adds image to image, each dynamic and\nimportunate, piling up sin's intolerable burden.\n\nThen comes regeneration, and the washing away of sin, through the fiery,\ncreative power of the Soul, which burns out the stains of the psychic vesture,\npurifying it as gold is refined in the furnace. The suffering of regeneration\nsprings from this indispensable purifying.\n\nThen the psychic vesture begins to take on the colour of the Soul, no longer\nstained, but suffused with golden light; and the man red generate gleams with\nthe radiance of eternity. Thus the Spiritual Man puts on fair raiment; for of\nthis cleansing it is said: Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white\nas snow; though they be as crimson, they shall be as wool.\n\n### 24\\. The psychic nature, which has been printed with mind-images of\ninnumerable material things, exists now for the Spiritual Man, building for\nhim.\n\nThe 'mind,' once the tyrant, is now the slave, recognized as outward,\nseparate, not Self, a well-trained instrument of the Spiritual Man.\n\nFor it is not ordained for the Spiritual Man that, finding his high realm, he\nshall enter altogether there, and pass out of the vision of mankind. It is\ntrue that he dwells in heaven, but he also dwells on earth. He has angels and\narchangels, the hosts of the just made perfect, for his familiar friends, but\nhe has at the same time found a new kinship with the prone children of men,\nwho stumble and sin in the dark. Finding sinlessness, he finds also that the\nworld's sin and shame are his, not to share, but to atone; finding kinship\nwith angels, he likewise finds his part in the toil of angels, the toil for\nthe redemption of the world.\n\nFor this work, he, who now stands in the heavenly realm, needs his instrument\non earth; and this instrument he finds, ready to his hand, and fitted and\nperfected by the very struggles he has waged against it, in the personality,\nthe 'mind,' of the personal man. This once tyrant is now his servant and\nperfect ambassador, bearing witness, before men, of heavenly things and even\nin this present world doing the will and working the works of the Father.\n\n### 25\\. For him who discerns between the Mind and the Spiritual Man, there\ncomes perfect fruition of the longing after the real being of the Self.\n\nHow many times in the long struggle have the Soul's aspirations seemed but a\nhopeless, impossible dream, a madman's counsel of perfection. Yet every\nfinest, most impossible aspiration shall be realized, and ten times more than\nrealized, once the long, arduous fight against the 'mind,' and the mind's\nworldview is won. And then it will be seen that unfaith and despair were but\nweapons of the 'mind,' to daunt the Soul, and put off the day when the neck of\nthe 'mind' shall be put under the foot of the Soul.\n\nHave you aspired, well-nigh hopeless, after immortality? You shall be paid by\nentering the immortality of God.\n\nHave you aspired, in misery and pain, after consoling, healing love? You shall\nbe made a dispenser of the divine love of God Himself to weary souls.\n\nHave you sought ardently, in your day of feebleness, after power? You shall\nwield power immortal, infinite, with God working the works of God.\n\nHave you, in lonely darkness, longed for companionship and consolation? You\nshall have angels and archangels for your friends, and all the immortal hosts\nof the Dawn.\n\nThese are the fruits of victory. Therefore overcome. These are the prizes of\nregeneration. Therefore die to self, that you may rise again to God.\n\n### 26\\. Thereafter, the whole personal being bends toward illumination,\ntoward Eternal Life.\n\nThis is part of the secret of the Soul, that salvation means, not merely that\na soul shall be cleansed and raised to heaven, but that the whole realm of the\nnatural powers shall be redeemed, building up, even in this present world, the\nkingly figure of the Spiritual Man.\n\nThe traditions of the ages are full of his footsteps; majestic, uncomprehended\nshadows, myths, demi-gods, fill the memories of all the nobler peoples. But\nthe time cometh, when he shall be known, no longer demi-god, nor myth, nor\nshadow, but the ever-present Redeemer, working amid men for the life and\ncleansing of all souls.\n\n### 27\\. In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the\nimpressions of the dynamic mind-images.\n\nThe battle is long and arduous. Let there be no mistake as to that. Go not\nforth to this battle without counting the cost. Ages have gone to the\nstrengthening of the foe. Ages of conflict must be spent, ere the foe, wholly\nconquered, becomes the servant, the Soul's minister to mankind.\n\nAnd from these long past ages, in hours when the contest flags, will come new\nfoes, mind-born children springing up to fight for mind, reinforcements coming\nfrom forgotten years, forgotten lives. For once this conflict is begun, it can\nbe ended only by sweeping victory, and unconditional, unreserved surrender of\nthe vanquished.\n\n### 28\\. These are to be overcome as it was taught that hindrances should be\novercome.\n\nThese new enemies and fears are to be overcome by ceaselessly renewing the\nfight, by a steadfast, dogged persistence, whether in victory or defeat, which\nshall put the stubbornness of the rocks to shame. For the Soul is older than\nall things, and invincible; it is of the very nature of the Soul to be\nunconquerable.\n\nTherefore fight on, undaunted; knowing that the spiritual will, once awakened,\nshall, through the effort of the contest, come to its full strength; that\nground gained can be held permanently; that great as is the dead-weight of the\nadversary, it is yet measurable, while the Warrior who fights for you, for\nwhom you fight, is, in might, immeasurable, invincible, everlasting.\n\n### 29\\. He who, after he has attained, is wholly free from self, reaches the\nessence of all that can be known, gathered together like a cloud. This is the\ntrue spiritual consciousness.\n\nIt has been said that, at the beginning of the way, we must kill out ambition,\nthe great curse, the giant weed which grows as strongly in the heart of the\ndevoted disciple as in the man of desire. The remedy is sacrifice of self,\nobedience, humility; that purity of heart which gives the vision of God.\nThereafter, he who has attained is wrapt about with the essence of all that\ncan be known, as with a cloud; he has that perfect illumination which is the\ntrue spiritual consciousness. Through obedience to the will of God, he comes\ninto oneness of being with God; he is initiated into God's view of the\nuniverse, seeing all life as God sees it.\n\n### 30\\. Thereon comes surcease from sorrow and the burden of toil.\n\nSuch a one, it is said, is free from the bond of Karma, from the burden of\ntoil, from that debt to works which comes from works done in self-love and\ndesire. Free from self-will, he is free from sorrow, too, for sorrow comes\nfrom the fight of self-will against the divine will, through the correcting\nstress of the divine will, which seeks to counteract the evil wrought by\ndisobedience. When the conflict with the divine will ceases, then sorrow\nceases, and he who has grown into obedience, thereby enters into joy.\n\n### 31\\. When all veils are rent, all stains washed away, his knowledge\nbecomes infinite; little remains for him to know.\n\nThe first veil is the delusion that thy soul is in some permanent way separate\nfrom the great Soul, the divine Eternal. When that veil is rent, thou shalt\ndiscern thy oneness with everlasting Life. The second veil is the delusion of\nenduring separateness from thy other selves, whereas in truth the soul that is\nin them is one with the soul that is in thee. The world's sin and shame are\nthy sin and shame: its joy also.\n\nThese veils rent, thou shalt enter into knowledge of divine things and human\nthings. Little will remain unknown to thee.\n\n### 32\\. Thereafter comes the completion of the series of transformations of\nthe three nature potencies, since their purpose is attained.\n\nIt is a part of the beauty and wisdom of the great Indian teachings, the\nVedanta and the Yoga alike, to hold that all life exists for the purposes of\nSoul, for the making of the spiritual man. They teach that all nature is an\norderly process of evolution, leading up to this, designed for this end,\nexisting only for this: to bring forth and perfect the Spiritual Man. He is\nthe crown of evolution: at his coming, the goal of all development is\nattained.\n\n### 33\\. The series of transformations is divided into moments. When the\nseries is completed, time gives place to duration.\n\nThere are two kinds of eternity, says the commentary: the eternity of immortal\nlife, which belongs to the Spirit, and the eternity of change, which inheres\nin Nature, in all that is not Spirit. While we are content to live in and for\nNature, in the Circle of Necessity, Sansara, we doom ourselves to perpetual\nchange. That which is born must die, and that which dies must be reborn. It is\nchange evermore, a ceaseless series of transformations.\n\nBut the Spiritual Man enters a new order; for him, there is no longer eternal\nchange, but eternal Being. He has entered into the joy of his Lord. This\nspiritual birth, which makes him heir of the Everlasting, sets a term to\nchange; it is the culmination, the crowning transformation, of the whole realm\nof change.\n\n### 34\\. Pure spiritual life is, therefore, the inverse resolution of the\npotencies of Nature, which have emptied themselves of their value for the\nSpiritual man; or it is the return of the power of pure Consciousness to its\nessential form.\n\nHere we have a splendid generalization, in which our wise philosopher finally\nreconciles the naturalists and the idealists, expressing the crown and end of\nhis teaching, first in the terms of the naturalist, and then in the terms of\nthe idealist.\n\nThe birth and growth of the Spiritual Man, and his entry into his immortal\nheritage, may be regarded, says our philosopher, either as the culmination of\nthe whole process of natural evolution and involution, where 'that which\nflowed from out the boundless deep, turns again home'; or it may be looked at,\nas the Vedantins look at it, as the restoration of pure spiritual\nConsciousness to its pristine and essential form. There is no discrepancy or\nconflict between these two views, which are but two accounts of the same\nthing. Therefore those who study the wise philosopher, be they naturalist or\nidealist, have no excuse to linger over dialetic subtleties or disputes. These\nthings are lifted from their path, lest they should be tempted to delay over\nthem, and they are left facing the path itself, stretching upward and onward\nfrom their feet to the everlasting hills, radiant with infinite Light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
