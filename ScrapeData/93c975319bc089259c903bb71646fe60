I do not move about in this world in the way which, according to\nyour own understanding, you have guessed. I 5 am a Brahma _n_ a, I am\n\np. 307\n\nemancipated, I am a forester, and I likewise perform the duties of a\nhouseholder, observing vows. I am not such, O beautiful one! as you see me\nwith the eye. I pervade every single thing that is in this world. Whatever\ncreatures there are in the world, movable or not moving, know me to be the\ndestroyer of them as fire is of wood 1. Sovereignty over the whole world, and\neven over heaven; that, or else this knowledge; (of these two) knowledge is my\nonly wealth 2. This 3 is the path of the Brahma _n_ as, by which those who\nunderstand that 4 proceed, to households, or residence in forests, or,\ndwelling with preceptors, or among mendicants 5. With numerous unconfused\nsymbols only one knowledge is approached. And those who, adhering to various\nsymbols and \xc3\x82 _s_ ramas, have their understanding full of tranquillity 6, go\nto the single entity as rivers to the ocean. This path is traversed by the\nunderstanding, not by the body 7. Actions have a beginning and an end, and the\nbody is tied down by action. Hence, O beautiful one! you\n\np. 308\n\n(need) have no fear occasioned by the other world. With your heart intent upon\nthe real entity, you will certainly come into my self.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[306:1](sbe0844.htm#fr_1464) I. e. to put him to the test. Such examinations\nare often referred to in our later literature.\n\n[306:2](sbe0844.htm#fr_1465) I. e. Veda, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[306:3](sbe0844.htm#fr_1466) I. e. says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, which leads to\nthe seat from which there is no return. Cf. Gita, [p.\n112](sbe0817.htm#page_112).\n\n[306:4](sbe0844.htm#fr_1467) The wheel is the yoga, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\nThe expression is noteworthy, as being that used of Buddha's teaching. See on\nthat Davids' Buddhism, p. 45.\n\n[306:5](sbe0845.htm#fr_1468) The man who has achieved final emancipation has\ngot that, in which the benefits to be derived from the course of life of a\nBrahma _n_ a, &c., are included (see [p. 191](sbe0826.htm#page_191) supra).\nHence, says he, the p. 307 doubt, on which your question is based as to what\nworld you will go to by being joined to me, is wrong. See [p.\n256](sbe0832.htm#page_256) supra.\n\n[307:1](sbe0845.htm#fr_1469) He is speaking here on the footing of the\nessential identity of everything. Cf. Gita, [p. 62](sbe0806.htm#page_62).\n\n[307:2](sbe0845.htm#fr_1470) The expression here is clumsy; the meaning is\nthat he prefers knowledge to sovereignty, if the alternative is offered him.\n\n[307:3](sbe0845.htm#fr_1471) Viz. knowledge.\n\n[307:4](sbe0845.htm#fr_1472) I. e. the Brahman.\n\n[307:5](sbe0845.htm#fr_1473) These are the four orders or \xc3\x82 _s_ ramas.\n\n[307:6](sbe0845.htm#fr_1474) The knowledge to be acquired, by whatever symbols\nthe attempt to acquire it is made, is but this, that all is one; and that is\nacquired certainly when tranquillity has been achieved.\n\n[307:7](sbe0845.htm#fr_1475) I. e. by realising the identity of everything,\nnot by the actions performed with the body, which, as he goes on to show, are\nperishable, and cannot lead to any lasting result.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIX](sbe0846.htm)\n\n"
