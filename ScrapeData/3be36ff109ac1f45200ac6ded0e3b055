Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Everlasting One! O Muni! Now describe the various\nactions that lead to these tormenting hells. I like to hear about them in\ndetail.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n2-52. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Devar _s_ i! He who steals other\xc2\x92s sons, wives,\nand riches, the wicked fellow is taken to Yama by His messengers. Tied down\nhard and fast by the terrible messengers of Yama, by the Kala rope (rope of\ntime), he is taken to the Tamisra hell, the place of many torments. There the\nYama\xc2\x92s attendants punish him, beat him and threaten him; and he becomes\nstupefied, and feels himself very weak, distressed and ultimately faints. He\nwho deceives another\xc2\x92s husband and enjoys his wives; the Yama\xc2\x92s servants drag\nhim down to Andha Tamisra hell. There he suffers any amount of pain and\nsuffering. He loses instantly his eyesight and his brain gets upset. His state\nresembles that of a tree when its trunk is broken. For this reason the ancient\nsages called this Andha Tamisra. He who being subject to \xc2\x93My\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93Mine\xc2\x94\nquarrels with others and being very much attached, maintains his family,\nleaves his families here and goes with his bad tendencies to the Raurava hell,\nvery horrible to all. The animals whom he injured and killed before in this\nworld, assume the form of Ruru animal and torment him in the next. For this\nreason, the intelligent knowers of Pura _n_ a, call this Raurava. The ancients\nsay, that Ruru is more cruel and ferocious than snakes. These animals live in\nthat hell; hence it is termed Maharaurava. He who torments others, goes to\nthis hell and these Rurus, the flesh-eaters, spring on his body and bite and\neat his flesh. He who cooks other animals and birds, that cruel and ferocious,\nthus deluded, is cooked in return on the hot oil in the Kumbhipaka hell by the\nYama Dutas for thousand years. He who quarrels with his Pitris and the Brahma\n_n_ as, is taken by the Yama Dutas to the Kalasutra hell and there be burnt by\nthe fire and Sun. There that hellish person, being troubled very much, inside\nand outside by hunger and thirst, sometimes sits, sometimes sleeps, sometimes\nwalks, and sometimes runs hither and thither. O Devar _s_ i! He who\ntransgresses the path of the Vedas in times other than those of calamity and\ndanger and follows other paths\n\n\n\np. 789\n\n\n\neven to a trifling distance, that sinner is taken by Yamadutas to Asipatra\nKanana and there whipped severely. Not being able to bear that, he runs wildly\nto and fro and is pierced by the sharpedged Asi leaves on both his sides. His\nwhole body being cut asunder, he cries \xc2\x93Oh! I am killed!\xc2\x94and faints away. Then\nfeeling himself pained very much, he tumbles down at every step. Thus the\nsinner suffers for violating the path of the Vedas. The King or that royal\npersonage who gives orders of punishment, not approved by Dharma, and hurts or\npunishes the body of a Brahma _n_ a, the Yama\xc2\x92s servants throw him down into\nthe S\xc2\x92ukaramukha Hell and grind down his body with great force as a sugarcane\nis ground down. He then cries aloud bitterly, he gets fainted and becomes\nstupefied. He is crushed by them and suffers all sorts of pains and miseries.\nAgain he who knows the feelings of others when they are tormented, pains those\ninsects who live on other\xc2\x92s blood as bugs, etc., and who does not realise\nother\xc2\x92s pains, goes, as a punishment for that fault to the Andhakupa Hell.\nThere he is pained by the beasts, birds, deers, reptiles, mosquitoes, bugs,\nlouses, flies and Dandas\xc2\x92ukas and various other cruel animals. There he lives\nin his ugly body and roams like a beast. The man who, getting even a trifling\nwealth and food-stuff, does not perform the five Maha Yaj\xc3\xb1as and gives not a\nshare of that to the Devas and feeds his own belly with that like a crow, is\ntaken by the ferocious Yamadutas to the worst Krimibhojana Naraka for his\nsinful deeds. This hell is one lakh Yoyanas wide and is the reservoir of\nworms. It causes terror to the inhabitants of the hell. That sinner assumes\nthe form of an insect and is eaten up on return by the insects and thus passes\nhis time there. When a man does not give any share to the Atithis or the\nguests and does not offer oblations to the Fire and eats his food, he, too,\ngoes to the above hell. When a man in times other than that of great danger\nand distress, follows the livelihood of a thief and robs gold and jewels\nforcibly of a Brahmi _n_ or any other person, he is taken to this hell and the\nYama\xc2\x92s servants pierce and cut off his skin by a fiery hot iron cutter. When a\nman goes for an illicit cohabitation to one who is not fit to be approached\nand when a woman goes similarly to an unapproachable man, both of them are\ntaken, being whipped, to this hell by the servants of Yama! Where the man is\nobliged to embrace a fiery hot iron figure of woman and vice versa. When a man\ngoes to all sorts of wombs for unnatural crimes, he is taken to Vajra Ka _nt_\naka Naraka and placed on the top of an iron S\xc2\x92almali wood. When a King or any\nroyal personage, subject to the Pa _s_ a _nd_ a Dharma (i.e., the unrighteous\npath) breaks the boundary of a law, he for that sin goes to Vaitara _n_ i, the\nditch round that hell. There the aquatic animals eat\n\n\n\np. 790\n\n\n\nhis body all around. O Narada! Yet neither his life nor his body parts with\nhim. He is thrown, for his Karma, into the rivers filled with faeces, urine,\npuss, blood, hairs, bones, nails, flesh, marrow, fat, etc., and he becomes\nvery much troubled. Those who are the husbands of Vri _s_ alis (girls under\ntwelve years of age, who have attained menstruation; or the barren women),\nvoid of any S\xc2\x92aucha (cleanliness) or shame and without any \xc3\x82chara Vyavahara\n(the following of one\xc2\x92s natural customs and rites) and those who follow\nPas\xc2\x92vachara (like beasts), they meet with a very hard fate and are thrown into\nthis hell filled with faeces, urine, cough, blood and other impurities and\nwhen they feel hungry, are forced to eat the above things. When those persons\nthat are twice born, maintain dogs and asses, etc., and when they are addicted\nto hunting, and kill daily, for nothing, beasts, birds and deer, those\nevildoers are specially watched by the servants of Yama and when they retire,\nthey tear them asunder by shooting bows at them. He who kills animals, engaged\nvainly in a sacrifice and addicted to haughty tempers and habits, is thrown\ninto this hell by the Yama\xc2\x92s servants and whipped very severely. The twice-\nborn that copulates blindly with a savar _n_ a wife, is taken by the Yama\xc2\x92s\nmessengers into the hell filled with semen and he is made to drink that. Those\nwho are addicted to robbery, who put fire to other\xc2\x92s houses, who make others\ndrink poison, those that are treacherous, and who destroy the interest of the\nvillagers and other persons, those kings or the royal personages are taken\nafter their death by the Yamadutas to the Sarameyadana hell. There seven\nhundred and twenty dogs, very wonderful to behold, come furiously and with\ngreat force and energy, over them and feed on them. O Narada! This hell is\ndenominated as Sarameyadana Naraka and it is very horrible. Now I will\ndescribe to you the other hells Avichi and others.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-second Chapter of the Eighth Book on the narrative of the\nsins leading to hells in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 23](bk08ch23.htm)\n\n'
