(The lawful occupations common) to (all) twice-born men are studying the\n(Veda), offering sacrifices (for their own sake), and giving (alms). 1\n\n2\\. Teaching, performing sacrifices for others, and receiving alms (are) the\nadditional (occupations) of a Brahma _n_ a. 2\n\n3\\. But the former (three) are obligatory (on him). 3\n\n4\\. Instruction in the Veda (may be given) without the above-mentioned (vows\nand ceremonies) in case a teacher, blood relations, friends or Gurus (receive\nit), and in case (the Veda) is exchanged for money or learning. 4\n\np. 228\n\n5\\. Agriculture and trade (are) also (lawful for a Brahma _n_ a) provided he\ndoes not do the work himself, 5\n\n6\\. Likewise lending money at interest.\n\n7\\. To protect all created beings is the additional (occupation) of a king, 7\n\n8\\. And to inflict lawful punishments.\n\n9\\. He shall support (those) _S_ rotriyas, (who are) Brahma _n_ as, 9\n\n10\\. And people unable to work, (even if they are) not Brahma _n_ as,\n\n11\\. And those who are free from taxes, 11\n\n12\\. And (needy) temporary students. 12\n\n13\\. And (to take) measures for ensuring victory (is another duty of a king),\n13\n\n14\\. Especially when danger (from foes threatens the kingdom);\n\np. 229\n\n15\\. And (to learn) the management of chariots and the use of the bow (is a\nfurther duty of the king),\n\n16\\. As well as to stand firm in battle and not to turn back. 16\n\n17\\. No sin (is committed) by injuring or slaying (foes) in battle, 17\n\n18\\. Excepting those who have lost their horses, charioteers, or arms, those\nwho join their hands (in supplication), those who flee with flying hair, those\nwho sit down with averted faces, those who have climbed (in flight) on\neminences or trees, messengers, and those who declare themselves to be cows or\nBrahma _n_ as.\n\n19\\. If another Kshatriya is supported by (the king), he shall follow the same\noccupations as his (master).\n\n20\\. The victor shall receive the booty gained in battle. 20\n\n21\\. But chariots and animals used for riding (belong) to the king,\n\n22\\. And a preferential share, except when the booty has been gained in single\ncombat. 22\n\n23\\. But the king shall equitably divide (all) other (spoils).\n\n24\\. Cultivators (must) pay to the king a tax 24\n\np. 230\n\n(amounting to) one-tenth, one-eighth, or one-sixth (of the produce).\n\n25\\. Some declare, that (there is a tax) also on cattle and gold, (viz.) one-\nfiftieth (of the stock). 25\n\n26\\. In the case of merchandise one-twentieth (must be paid by the seller) as\nduty, 26\n\n27\\. (And) of roots, fruits, flowers, medicinal herbs, honey, meat, grass, and\nfirewood one-sixtieth. 27\n\n28\\. For it is the duty (of the king) to protect the (tax-payers). 28\n\n29\\. But to (the collection of) these (taxes) he shall always pay particular\nattention. 29\n\n30\\. He shall live on the surplus. 30\n\n31\\. Each artisan shall monthly do one (day\'s) work (for the king). 31\n\n32\\. Hereby (the taxes payable by) those who 32\n\np. 231\n\nsupport themselves by personal labour have been explained,\n\n33\\. And (those payable by) owners of ships and carts.\n\n34\\. He for him must feed these (persons while they work).\n\n35\\. The merchants shall (each) give (every month one) article of merchandise\nfor less than the market value.\n\n36\\. Those who find lost (property) the owner of which is not (known), shall\nannounce it to the king. 36\n\n37\\. The king shall cause it to be proclaimed (by the public crier), and (if\nthe owner does not appear) hold it in his custody for a year.\n\n38\\. Afterwards one-fourth (of the value goes) to the finder (and) the\nremainder to the king.\n\n39\\. A (man becomes) owner by inheritance, purchase, partition, seizure, or\nfinding. 39\n\n40\\. Acceptance is for a Brahma _n_ a an additional (mode of acquisition);\n\n41\\. Conquest for a Kshatriya;\n\n42\\. Gain (by labour) for a Vai _s_ ya or _S_ udra.\n\n43\\. Treasure-trove is the property of the king, 43\n\np. 232\n\n44\\. Excepting (such as is found) by a Brahma _n_ a who lives according to\n(the law). 44\n\n45\\. Some declare, that a finder of a non-Brahmanical caste even, who\nannounces (his find to the king), shall obtain one-sixth (of the value).\n\n46\\. Having recovered property stolen by thieves, he shall return it to the\nowner; 46\n\n47\\. Or (if the stolen property is not recovered) he shall pay (its value) out\nof his treasury. 47\n\n48\\. The property of infants must be protected until they attain their\nmajority or complete their studentship. 48\n\n49\\. The additional (occupations) of a Vai _s_ ya are, agriculture, trade,\ntending cattle, and lending money at interest. 49\n\n50\\. The _S_ udra (belongs to) the fourth caste, which has one birth (only).\n50\n\np. 233\n\n51\\. For him also (are prescribed) truthfulness, meekness, and purity. 51\n\n52\\. Some (declare), that instead of sipping water, he shall wash his hands\nand feet.\n\n53\\. (He shall also offer) the funeral oblations, 53\n\n54\\. Maintain those depending upon him,\n\n55\\. Live with his wife (only), 55\n\n56\\. And serve the higher (castes). 56\n\n57\\. From them he shall seek to obtain his livelihood. 57\n\n58\\. (He shall use their) cast-off shoes, umbrellas, garments, and mats (for\nsitting on), 58\n\n59\\. (And) eat the remnants of their food;\n\n60\\. And (he may) live by (practising) mechanical arts; 60\n\n61\\. And the \xc3\x82rya under whose protection he places himself, must support him\neven if he (becomes) unable to work.\n\n62\\. And a man of higher caste (who is his master and has fallen into distress\nmust be maintained) by him.\n\n63\\. His hoard shall serve this purpose.\n\n64\\. If permission has been given to him, he\n\np. 234\n\nmay use the exclamation nama _h_ (adoration) as his Mantra.\n\n65\\. Some (declare), that he himself may offer the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as. 65\n\n66\\. And all men must serve those who belong to higher castes.\n\n67\\. If \xc3\x82ryans and non-\xc3\x82ryans interchange their occupations and conduct (the\none taking that of the other, there is) equality (between them). 67\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[227:1](sbe0274.htm#fr_1088) **X**. Twice-born men, i.e. Brahma _n_ as,\nKshatriyas, and Vai _s_ yas. Haradatta says that some believe the term \'twice-\nborn\' to have been used in order to indicate that the three occupations may be\nlawfully followed after the second birth, i.e. the initiation only. But he\ndeclares that alms may be given even by an uninitiated \xc3\x82ryan, while studying\nthe Veda and sacrificing are specially forbidden to him.\n\n[227:2](sbe0274.htm#fr_1089) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 10, 4.\n\n[227:3](sbe0274.htm#fr_1090) Manu X, 76. The former, i.e. the three beginning\nwith studying (Sutra 1), must necessarily be followed. If he neglects them, he\ncommits sin; if he follows them, he will be exalted. But the other\noccupations, teaching, &c., shall be followed if there is occasion for them.\nNo sin is committed by neglecting them, nor any greatness gained by following\nthem. They are merely means of livelihood.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[227:4](sbe0274.htm#fr_1091) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 13, 15-18. The expression \'above-\nmentioned\' refers to the whole of the rules regarding a pupil\'s conduct given\nabove, I, 52-II, 51. It is difficult to understand what is intended by \'the\nexchange of the Veda for wealth or money,\' if it is not the bh _ri_\ntakadhyapana or teaching for money which Manu III, 156 blames so severely. It\nseems to me unlikely that Gautama means simply to sanction this practice. It\nis more probable that his rule refers to the case of Brahma _n_ as in\ndistress, who avail themselves of the permission given above, VII, 4.\n\n[228:5](sbe0274.htm#fr_1092)-6. These rules which allow Brahma _n_ as to be\ngentlemen farmers and sleeping partners in mercantile or banking firms,\nmanaged by Vai _s_ yas, do not occur in other Sm _ri_ tis. But they agree with\nthe practice followed at present in many parts of India, and the praise\nbestowed in Vedic works on those who present land to Brahma _n_ as as well as\nthe numerous ancient land grants show that from early times many Brahma _n_ as\nwere holders of land, which, as a rule, was cultivated by _S_ udras.\n\n[228:7](sbe0274.htm#fr_1093)-8. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 10, 6; Manu VII, 27.\n\n[228:9](sbe0274.htm#fr_1094) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 25, 11; Manu VII, 135.\n\n[228:11](sbe0274.htm#fr_1095) Haradatta takes this Sutra differently. He says:\n\'The immunity from taxes which has been granted to Brahma _n_ as and others by\nformer kings he shall maintain in the same manner as formerly! But I think\nthat \'akara\' must be taken as a Bahuvrihi compound, and is used to designate\nwidows, orphans, ascetics, &c.; see \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 26, 10-7.\n\n[228:12](sbe0274.htm#fr_1096) Haradatta observes that others explain upakurva\n_n_ a, \'temporary students,\' opposed to naish _th_ ika, \'permanent students,\'\nto mean \'men who benefit the people,\' i.e. physicians and the like.\n\n[228:13](sbe0274.htm#fr_1097) Manu III, 103-110, 160-200; X, 119.\n\n[229:16](sbe0274.htm#fr_1098) Manu VII, 87-89; X, 119; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I,\n233.\n\n[229:17](sbe0274.htm#fr_1099)-18. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 10, 11. Persons who declare\nthemselves to be cows or Brahma _n_ as become inviolable on account of the\nsacred character of the beings they personate. Historical instances are\nnarrated where conquered kings were forced to appear before their victors,\nholding grass in their mouths or dancing like peacocks in order to save their\nlives.\n\n[229:20](sbe0274.htm#fr_1100) Manu VII, 96.\n\n[229:22](sbe0274.htm#fr_1101)-23. Manu VII, 97.\n\n[229:24](sbe0274.htm#fr_1102) Manu VII, 130. The amount depends on the nature\nof the soil and the manner of cultivation.\n\n[230:25](sbe0274.htm#fr_1103) Manu VII, 130. The above translation follows\nHaradatta\'s explanation, while Sir W. Jones\' rendering of Manu gives a\ndifferent meaning to the identical words.\n\n[230:26](sbe0274.htm#fr_1104) Manu VII, 127.\n\n[230:27](sbe0274.htm#fr_1105) Manu X, 120.\n\n[230:28](sbe0274.htm#fr_1106) Manu VII, 128.\n\n[230:29](sbe0274.htm#fr_1107) Manu VII, 128, 139.\n\n[230:30](sbe0274.htm#fr_1108) Haradatta takes this Sutra differently. He says,\n\'Adhika, "additional," means the money which is paid on account of (the\nadditional occupations) which have been explained above (Sutra 7 seq.) "To\nprotect all created beings," &c. Thereon shall he live, he himself, his\nservants, his elephants, horses, and his other (animals).\' If this explanation\nis adopted, the Sutra ought to be translated thus, \'He shall live on (the\ntaxes paid for his) additional (occupations).\' It seems, however, more\nprobable that Gautama means to say that the king shall live on the surplus\nwhich remains after providing for the external and internal security of the\nkingdom, and that his object is to forbid the application of the whole revenue\nto the personal expenses of the ruler.\n\n[230:31](sbe0274.htm#fr_1109) Manu VII, 131.\n\n[230:32](sbe0274.htm#fr_1110) Haradatta says that wood-carriers, dancers, and\nthe like are intended.\n\n[231:36](sbe0274.htm#fr_1111)-38. Manu VIII, 30-36; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 33,\n173; Macnaghten, Mitakshara I, 1, 6.\n\n[231:39](sbe0274.htm#fr_1112) Manu X, 115; Mayukha IV, 1, 2; Colebrooke,\nMitakshara I, 1, 8; III, Digest IV, 22. \'Partition, i.e., the division (of the\nestate) between brothers and other (coparceners); seizure, i.e. the\nappropriation before (others) of forest trees and other things which have no\nowner; finding, i.e. the appropriation of lost property the owner of which is\nunknown, such as treasure-trove.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[231:43](sbe0274.htm#fr_1113) Manu VIII, 38; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 34;\nMacnaghten, Mitakshara V, 1, 10.\n\n[232:44](sbe0274.htm#fr_1114) Manu VIII, 37; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 34;\nMacnaghten loc. cit.\n\n[232:46](sbe0274.htm#fr_1115) Manu VIII, 40; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 36;\nMacnaghten, Mitakshara V, 1, 14.\n\n[232:47](sbe0274.htm#fr_1116) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 26, 8; Macnaghten loc. cit.\n\n[232:48](sbe0274.htm#fr_1117) Manu VIII, 27.\n\n[232:49](sbe0274.htm#fr_1118) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 10, 7.\n\n[232:50](sbe0274.htm#fr_1119) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 6; Manu X, 4. Between this\nSutra and the next, my MSS. insert an additional one, not found in Professor\nStenzler\'s edition, _S_ udrasyapi nishekapu _m_ savanasimantonnayana _g_\natakarmanamakara _n_ opanishkrama _n_ annapra _s_ ana _k_ aulanyamantraka _n_\ni yathakalam upadish _t_ ani _t_ i, \'for the _S_ udra also the Nisheka (or\nimpregnation), the Pu _m_ savana (or rite for securing male offspring), the\nSimantonnayana (or arranging the parting of a pregnant wife), the _G_\natakarman (or ceremony on the birth of the child), the name-giving, the first\nwalk in the open air, the first feeding, and the _K_ aula (or tonsure of the\nchild\'s head) are prescribed to be performed at the proper periods, but\nwithout the recitation of sacred texts.\' But I am inclined to consider it\nspurious: first, because there is no proper commentary; secondly, because the\nenumeration of the Sa _m_ skaras given here does not agree with p. 233 that\ngiven above, VIII, 14; and thirdly, because, according to the practice of\nGautama, this Sutra should begin with \'tasyapi\' instead of with \'Sudrasyapi,\'\nand the \'tasyapi\' in the next would become superfluous. The rule agrees\nhowever with Manu X, 63, 127.\n\n[233:51](sbe0274.htm#fr_1120) Manu IX, 335.\n\n[233:53](sbe0274.htm#fr_1121) Manu X, 127-128.\n\n[233:55](sbe0274.htm#fr_1122) \'Another commentator explains the Sutra to mean\nthat he shall live with his wife only, and never enter another order (i.e.\nnever become a student, hermit, or ascetic).\'--Haradatta.\n\n[233:56](sbe0274.htm#fr_1123) \xc3\x82pastamba, I, 1, 1, 7-8; Manu X, 121-123.\n\n[233:57](sbe0274.htm#fr_1124) Manu X, 124.\n\n[233:58](sbe0274.htm#fr_1125)-59. Manu X, 125.\n\n[233:60](sbe0274.htm#fr_1126) Manu X, 99.\n\n[234:65](sbe0274.htm#fr_1127) Manu X, 127. Regarding the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as,\nsee above, VIII, 18.\n\n[234:67](sbe0274.htm#fr_1128) \'There is equality between them, i.e. the one\nneed not serve the other. A _S_ udra need not serve even a Brahma _n_ a, (much\nless) any other (twice-born man) who lives the life of a non-\xc3\x82ryan ( _S_\nudra). A _S_ udra, even, who conducts himself like an \'\xc3\x82ryan must not be\ndespised by men of other castes, who follow the occupations of non-\xc3\x82ryans, on\naccount of his inferior birth.\'--Haradatta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI](sbe0275.htm)\n\n'
