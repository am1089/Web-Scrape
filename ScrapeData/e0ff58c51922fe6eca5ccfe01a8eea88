The purpose of man (is effected) thence (i.e. through the mere knowledge\nof Brahman), thus Badaraya _n_ a opines.\n\nThe Sutrakara at present enters on an inquiry whether the knowledge of the\nSelf which is derived from the Upanishads, is connected with works through him\nwho is entitled to perform the works 1, or is an independent means to\naccomplish the purpose of man. He begins by stating the final view in the\nabove Sutra, 'Thence' &c. The teacher Badaraya _n_ a is of opinion that\nthence, i.e. through the independent knowledge of Brahman enjoined in the\nVedanta-texts, the purpose of man is effected.--Whence is this known?--'From\nscripture,' which exhibits passages such as the following: 'He who knows the\nSelf overcomes grief' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 4, 1); 'He who knows that highest\nBrahman becomes even Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9); 'He who knows Brahman\nattains the Highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'For him who has a teacher there is\ndelay only so long as he is not delivered; then he will be perfect'( _Kh_. Up.\nVI. 14, 2); 'He who has searched out and understands the Self which is free\nfrom sin, &c. &c., obtains all worlds and all desires'( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 1);\n'The Self is to be seen' &c. up to 'Thus far goes immortality' (B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 5, 6-15). These and similar texts declare that mere knowledge effects the\npurpose of man.--Against this the opponent raises his voice as follows.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[285:1](sbe38210.htm#fr_182) The purvapakshin (see next Sutra) maintains that\nthe knowledge of the Self is subordinate to (sacrificial) action through the\nmediation of the agent, i.e. in so far as it imparts to the agent a certain\nqualification.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 2](sbe38211.htm)\n\n"
