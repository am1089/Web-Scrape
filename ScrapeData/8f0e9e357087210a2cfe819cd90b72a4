And of the corpse-like (animals?).\n\n5\\. Those which enter (their dens?) with the mouth first (?).\n\np. 142\n\n6 [6](sbe29094.htm#fn_323). When he has vomited, or when his beard has been\nshaved,\n\n7 [7](sbe29094.htm#fn_324). When he has eaten flesh or partaken of a _S_\nraddha or birth dinner,\n\n8\\. During the days that immediately follow on (days of) study in the village,\n\n9\\. Three nights (and days), if (he has been) put out of order,\n\n10\\.

And if fire-flames, lightning, thunder, (heavy) rains, and great clouds\nappear,\n\n13\\. And if a storm (blows) that carries away pebbles, as long as that lasts.\n\n2, 1.
