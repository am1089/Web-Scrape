Inasmuch as there are three Anush _t_ ubh verses 3 (on the first\nday), therefore the horse, when standing, stands on three (feet); and inasmuch\nas (they are made into) four Gayatri verses, therefore the horse, when\nstepping out, scampers off on all (four) feet. For that Anush _t_ ubh,\ndoubtless, is the highest metre, and the horse is the highest of animals; and\nthe Katush _t_ oma is the highest of Stomas: by means of what is highest he\nthus causes him (the Sacrificer) to reach the highest position.\n\n13:3:3:22\\. The _S_ akvari verses are the (Hot _ri_ 's) P _ri_ sh _th_ a (of\nthe second day): there is a different metre for\n\np. 333\n\neach (verse), for different Stomas are performed on each (day). And as to the\n_S_ akvari verse being the P _ri_ sh _th_ a (-stotra), it is for the\ncompleteness of the horse (sacrifice).\n\n13:3:3:33\\. The central day is an Ekavi _m_ _s_ a one, for the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a\nis yonder sun, and so is the A _s_ vamedha by means of its own Stoma he thus\nestablishes it in its own deity.\n\n13:3:3:44\\. The Vamadevya is the Maitravaru _n_ a's Saman 1; for the Vamadevya\nis Pra _g_ apati, and the horse is of Pra _g_ apati's nature: he thus supplies\nit with its own deity.\n\n13:3:3:55\\. The Parthura _s_ ma is the Brahma-saman 2; for the horse is\nrestrained by means of reins 3 (ra _s_ mi), but when unrestrained, unchecked,\nand unsteadied, it would be liable to go to the furthest distance: thus when\nthe Parthura _s_ ma is the Brahma-saman, it is for the safe keeping of the\nhorse.\n\n13:3:3:66\\. The Sa _m_ k _ri_ ti 4 is the A _kh_ avaka's Saman;--\n\np. 334\n\nthat A _s_ vamedha, indeed, is, as it were, a disused sacrifice, for what is\nperformed thereof, and what is not 1? When the Sa _m_ k _ri_ ti is the A _kh_\navaka's Saman, it is for (bringing about) the completeness of the horse\n(sacrifice). The last day is an Atiratra with all the (six) Stomas, in order\nto his (the Sacrificer's) obtaining everything, for an Atiratra with all the\nStomas is everything, and the A _s_ vamedha is everything.\n\n13:3:3:77\\. The fire-altar is the twenty-one-fold one 2, the Stoma the twenty-\none-fold one, and there are twenty-one sacrificial stakes; even as bulls or\nstallions 3 would clash together, so do these Stomas 4, the\n\np. 335\n\ntwenty-one-versed, run counter to one another: were he to bring them together,\nthe Sacrificer would suffer harm, and his sacrifice would be destroyed.\n\n13:3:3:88\\. There may, indeed, be a twelvefold altar, and eleven stakes. When\nthe altar is a twelvefold one--twelve months being a year--it is the year, the\nsacrifice, he obtains. When there are eleven stakes, then that Vira _g_\n(metre), the Ekada _s_ ini 1, is contrived; and that which is its eleventh\n(stake) is its teat: thereby he milks it.\n\n13:3:3:99\\. As to this they say, 'If there were a twelvefold altar, and eleven\nstakes, it would be as if one were to drive on a cart drawn by one beast.'\nThere are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and twenty-one\nstakes: that is as when one drives with side-horses.\n\n13:3:3:1010\\. That twenty-one-fold one, indeed, is the head of the sacrifice;\nand, verily, he who knows three heads on the A _s_ vamedha, becomes the head\nof kings. There are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and\ntwenty-one stakes: these are the three heads on the A _s_ vamedha; and,\nverily, he who thus knows them becomes the head of kings. And, indeed, he who\nknows the three tops on the A _s_ vamedha, becomes the top of kings;--there\nare the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and twenty-one\nstakes: these, indeed, are the three tops on the A _s_ vamedha; and, verily,\nhe who thus knows them becomes the top of kings.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[332:3](sbe44096.htm#fr_849) That is, for the Bahishpavamana-stotra of the _K_\natush _t_ oma, see [p. 329](sbe44094.htm#page_329), note.\n\n[333:1](sbe44096.htm#fr_850) That is, the hymn-tune of the second P _ri_ sh\n_th_ a-stotra chanted for the Maitravaru _n_ a (who responds thereto by the\nrecitation of the second Nishkevalya- _s_ astra): the Maha-Vamadevya on the\ntext 'kaya na _s_ _k_ itra bhuvat' (S. V. II, 32-34; figured for chanting in\nBibl. Ind. ed. III, p. 89) is ordinarily used for this stotra both in the\nAgnish _t_ oma, and in the Ukthya, form of sacrifice.\n\n[333:2](sbe44096.htm#fr_851) That is, the tune of the third, or Brahma _n_ a\n_kh_ a _m_ sin's, P _ri_ sh _th_ astotra. For the samans commonly used for\nthis stotra see part ii, p. 434, note 1. The Parthura _s_ ma-saman may be\nchanted on either of the texts Samav. II, 352-4 (figured ed. Bibl. Ind. vol.\nV, p. 395) or II, 355-7 (figured vol. V, p. 483). It is the latter text which\nis to be used on the present occasion. On the legendary origin of this saman\n(which is said to represent 'strength,' and therefore to be appropriate to a\nRa _g_ anya) see Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Br. XIII, 4, 17.\n\n[333:3](sbe44096.htm#fr_852) Or, is fastened by means of a rope.\n\n[333:4](sbe44096.htm#fr_853) The Sa _m_ k _ri_ ti-saman is used with the texts\nSamav. II, 663-4 (figured ed. Bibl. Ind. V, p. 407), II, 669-70 (ib. p. 482,\nwrongly p. 334 called Sa _m_ gati), and II, 679-82 (ib. p. 515). It is\nprobably the second of these texts that is to be used here, as it is also used\nfor the same stotra on the second day of the Garga-triratra.\n\n[334:1](sbe44096.htm#fr_854) Cp. the corresponding passage, Taitt. S. V, 4,\n12, 3, 'that A _s_ vamedha, indeed, is a disused sacrifice, for, say they, who\nknows if the whole of it is performed or not?' Perhaps, however, 'utsanna-ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a' rather means 'a decayed sacrifice,' i.e. one which has lost (or in\nthe usual performance is apt to lose) some of its original elements; whence\nthe 'Sa _m_ k _ri_ ti' tune is to be used for the purpose of 'making up' the\nlost parts. Part of the commentary in this passage is not clear to me:--uk _k_\nai _h_ kalapagramadau siddhasthane satrasthito granthato\xe0\xa4\xbdrthata _s_ _k_ a yat\nya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a utsannaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a esha ya _h_ a _s_ vamedha _h_ katham utsanna\nity ata aha, ki _m_ va hiti, yasya dharma _h_ purvayonau (? purvayuge) prayu\n_g_ yante tesha _m_ kim _k_ it kalau kriyate ki _m_ _k_ in na kriyate, tata\n_s_ _k_ a sa _m_ k _ri_ tir a _kh_ avakasama bhavati.\n\n[334:2](sbe44096.htm#fr_855) That is, an altar measuring twenty-one man's\nlengths on each of the four sides of its body.\n\n[334:3](sbe44096.htm#fr_856) The commentary seems to take both ' _ri_ shabha'\nand 'v _ri_ shan' here in the sense of 'bulls,' but cp. Taitt. Br. III, 8, 22,\n1, 'yatha va a _s_ va varshabha va v _ri_ sha _n_ a _h_ _s_ a _m_ sphurera _n_\n'--'even as if male horses or bulls were to clash together.'\n\n[334:4](sbe44096.htm#fr_857) That is, not only the twenty-one-fold Stoma, but\nalso the other two twenty-one-fold objects, looked upon as Stomas (lit. 'means\nof praise').\n\n[335:1](sbe44096.htm#fr_858) Viz. the set of eleven (stakes), here represented\nas a cow; but in order to assimilate it to the Vira _g_ , or metre consisting\nof ten syllables, the eleventh stake is made the teat or udder of the cow.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 3, 4.
