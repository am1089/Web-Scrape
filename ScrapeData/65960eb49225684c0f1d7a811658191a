Thus arises a title of law, termed Transgression of a Compact.\n\n* 2. 2 Among heretics, followers of the Veda (Naigamas), guilds (of merchants), corporations (Pugas), troops (of soldiers), assemblages (of kinsmen), and other (associations) the king must maintain the usages (settled among them), both in fortified towns and in the open country.\n\np. 154\n\n* 3. 3 Whatever be their laws, their (religious) duties, (the rules regarding) their attendance, and the (particular mode of) livelihood prescribed for them, that the king shall approve of.\n\n* 4. 4 The king shall prevent them from undertaking such acts as would be either opposed (to the wishes of the king), or contemptible in their nature, or injurious to his interests.\n\n* 5. 5 Mixed assemblages, unlawful wearing of arms, and mutual attacks between those persons shall not be tolerated by the king.\n\np. 155\n\n* 6. 6 Those who cause dissension among the members of an association, shall undergo punishment of a specially severe kind; because they would prove extremely dangerous, like an (epidemic) disease, if they were allowed to go free.\n\n* 7. 7 Whenever a criminal act, opposed to the dictates of morality, has been attempted, a king desirous of prosperity shall redress it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[153:1](sbe3342.htm#fr_447) X, 1. 'Heretics,' Kshapa _n_ akas (Buddhist or\nJain mendicants) and others who detract from the authority of the Veda.\n'Naigamas,' traders or merchants. According to the Mitakshara, the term\nNaigama refers to Pa _s_ upatas and others who uphold the authority of the\nVeda. The term 'and others' is used to include corporations of learned\nBrahmans and other (associations). Viramitrodaya, p. 423. The term samaya,\nliterally 'compact,' denotes local or caste usages, the violation of which\nforms the subject of the tenth title of law.\n\n[153:2](sbe3342.htm#fr_448) Of the term Naigama, the commentators give the\nsame two different interpretations as in the preceding paragraph. I have\nreferred it to 'followers of the Veda,' because it comes immediately after the\nterm 'heretics.' The term puga has three interpretations in this place. Some\nsay it means 'companies of traders or others.' p. 154 Others say it denotes\n'associations of persons differing in caste, whose mode of subsistence is not\nfixed.' The Viramitrodaya interprets it as referring to riders on elephants,\nhorses, &c. In explanation of the terms vrata, 'a troop of soldiers,' and ga\n_n_ a, 'an assemblage of kinsmen,' the commentators quote the following text\nof Katyayana: 'A multitude of united men armed with various weapons is called\nvrata. An assemblage of families is called ga _n_ a.' Manu VIII, 41; Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 192, &c.\n\n[154:3](sbe3342.htm#fr_449) 'Their laws,' such as to speak the truth. 'Their\n(religious) duties,' such as the duty of going about begging alms when the\nnight is over, early in the morning. 'The rules regarding their attendance,'\nthe duty of attending, in a temple or other (public hall), for the affairs of\nthe community, when the sound of a drum or other instrument is heard.\nViramitrodaya, p. 430. The Ratnakara interprets the term karma, 'their\n(religious) duties,' by 'their proper occupation for a livelihood.' The drift\nof this rule, according to [_G_ agannatha](errata.htm#1), is this, that the\nking must not act otherwise than is consistent with the usages of castes or\nother corporations. See Colebrooke's Digest, III, 2, 11. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nII, 192, &c.\n\n[154:4](sbe3342.htm#fr_450) 'Contemptible in their nature,' essentially\ndespicable, such as the eating of betel, which is customary among heretics and\nothers. 'Injurious to his interests,' causing pecuniary loss, &c. 'He shall\nprevent them from undertaking such acts,' he shall act so that they do not\nundertake them. Viramitrodaya, pp. 430, 431.\n\n[154:5](sbe3342.htm#fr_451) 'Mixed assemblages,' meetings or gatherings of\npersons differing in caste. 'Unlawful wearing of arms,' wearing arms without\nsufficient motives, such as the apprehension of a danger. See Ratnakara, as\nquoted in Colebrooke's Digest, III, 2, 25.\n\n[155:6](sbe3342.htm#fr_452) 'An association,' a guild of merchants or other\ncorporation. Viramitrodaya, p. 430.\n\n[155:7](sbe3342.htm#fr_453) When an act tainted with the sin of covetousness\nor another crime, and opposed to the dictates of revealed and traditional law,\nsuch as e.g. the prostitution of widows or other (virtuous females) among\nheretics or other (sinful men), has been attempted, the king must redress it,\nthough it may have been practised for a long time. Viramitrodaya, p. 431.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Eleventh Title of Law. Boundary Disputes](sbe3343.htm)\n\n"
