YOGA PRINCIPLES OF DIET\n\nModern man lives at the risk of self-poisoning through the foods he consumes.\nBody tissues are continually undergoing a change of structure, and the\nmultitude of cells that make up the body are constantly dying off while fresh\nmaterial is supplied. This fresh body-building material can come only from the\nfood one eats. While the first Yogins placed great importance on diet, it is\nonly in the last few years that Western scientists and physicians have paid\nattention to this subject. In laboratory tests with animals, and, to some\nextent, by controlled diet on human subjects, it has been proven that the\nproper adjustment of diet can not only cure and prevent certain diseases, but\nmay even prolong human life. It is also believed that with a change in diet,\nit is possible to change the character of a person.\n\nFor physical and mental well-being, quality and quantity of food play\nimportant parts. As to quantity, the old texts enjoin the Yogi to eat until\nhis stomach is one-half full. While the Yogins did not hand down their dietary\ninstructions in terms of carbohydrates, calories and vitamins, their treatment\nof dietetics has been found to be scientifically correct.\n\np. 82\n\n#### Types of Food\n\nAside from the philosophical principle of non-injury which would preclude\nkilling animals for food, Yogins believed that man is essentially an\nherbivorous animal. It can be noted that all of the higher apes are not flesh\neaters. A meat diet is actually believed to be unsuited to the human digestive\nsystem. Experiments at the Bombay Yoga Institute in Europe and in the\nCaribbean countries have shown that persons on low-protein and non-flesh diets\nhave greater endurance than individuals on high-protein and meat or mixed\ndiets. Only in the last few years has the Western medical profession begun\nresearch on the harmful effects of animal fat in food as a cause of high blood\npressure and coronary seizures.\n\nMany modern authorities on nutrition (we are not considering crackpot\nvegetarian theorists) advocate most strongly the exclusive use of dairy\nproducts, vegetables, fruits and nuts as the most beneficial human diet. Even\namong fruits and vegetables, certain types are considered especially valuable.\nBasically, Yogins found that man\'s natural instincts would lead him to the\nmost beneficial foods. Food stuffs which are pure, agreeable, sweet, easily\ndigested and nourishing are those which are recommended. These are dairy\nproducts and sweets, fresh milk products, natural butter, honey and sugar;\ncereals\xc2\x97wheat, barley and rice; legumes\xc2\x97beans of different types; vegetables\nand herbs\xc2\x97eggplant, all varieties of cucumber, okra, spinach, sprouts,\nlettuce, celery, and other broad-leafed vegetables; tubers\xc2\x97carrots, potatoes\nand medicinal roots; fruits\xc2\x97mangos, berries, figs, plantains, dates, apples.\n\nNo spices are allowed in the Yoga diet as they are considered stimulating and\nharmful, and as the vegetables\n\np. 83\n\nrecommended are highly rich in mineral salts. In addition, recent research by\nscientific Yoga institutes has established it as fact that condiments are a\nburden on the digestive system, and produce acids which poison the blood\nstream. Following the Yoga diet, a person whose food intake contains a liberal\namount of uncooked fruits and vegetables and only moderate amounts of protein\nand starches has little need for inorganic salt, and will feel little desire\nfor it.\n\nHighly-seasoned stuffs and stimulating drinks are considered unhealthy in the\nYoga diet. Foods that are sharp, sour, pungent, bitter and heating are\nprohibited. It has been found that food that has been cooked, grown cold, and\nheated again is unhealthy, and that overcooked jams and jellies have really\nlittle food value. Roasted foods also are among the prohibited items.\n\nFor those engaged in mental pursuits or in somewhat sedentary occupations, a\nwell-balanced vegetarian diet is preferred to a mixed-meat diet. It is easily\ndigested and when selected in proper and tasty combinations, it completely\nmeets the needs of the individual. From another point of view, it is a far\nless costly diet than the high-protein meat diet.\n\nNo exact quantity of food that would satisfy every individual has been\nestablished. Some require a higher intake than others. In the old Yoga texts,\nit is stated that one may "partake of food according to his desire."\nCommentaries on this text emphasize that moderation ( _mitahara_ ) is the\nguiding principle. One should eat no more or less than is absolutely necessary\nto satisfy one\'s appetite. Almost all the authors of Yoga texts interpret this\nto mean that half the stomach should be filled with food at each meal, leaving\none-quarter of the stomach space for water, one-quarter for air.\n\np. 84\n\nFor bodily health, it is suggested that the Yoga adherent limit himself to\nthree meals a day: a light breakfast at 8:30 A.M.; lunch at 1 P.M.; and the\nmain meal at about 6:30 P.M. It is also considered injurious to fill the\nstomach with food before food previously eaten has passed through the pylorus.\nThis usually takes about four hours.\n\nSome Yogins consider it harmful to drink water during meals. Many drink about\na pint of water on arising in the morning. This, it is believed, will wash\ndown the residues of the alimentary canal through increased peristalsis, and\nwill also facilitate evacuation. During the day, about two quarts of water\nshould be taken to purify the nose, stomach, intestines and the bladder.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 11. Sexual Principles and Practices in Yoga](rwy12.htm)\n\n'
