In every religion there are three parts; philosophy,\nmythology and ritual. Philosophy of course is the essence of every religion;\nmythology explains and illustrates it by means of the more or less legendary\nlives of great men, stories and fables of wonderful things and so on; ritual\ngives to that philosophy a still more concrete form, so that every one may\ngrasp it--ritual is in fact concretised philosophy. This ritual is _Karma;_ it\nis necessary in every religion, because most of us cannot understand abstract\nspiritual things until we grow much spiritually. It is easy for men to think\nthat they can understand anything, but when it comes to practical experience\nthey find that abstract ideas are often very hard to comprehend. Therefore\nsymbols are of great help and we cannot dispense with the symbolical method of\nputting things before us. From time immemorial symbols have been used by all\nkinds of religions. In one sense we cannot think but in symbols; words\nthemselves are symbols of thought. In another sense everything in the universe\nmay be looked upon as a symbol. The whole universe is a symbol and God is the\nessence behind. This kind of symbology is not simply the creation of man; it\nis not that certain people belonging to a religion sit down together and think\nout certain symbols, and bring them into existence out of their own minds. The\nsymbols of religion have a natural growth. Otherwise, why is it that certain\nsymbols are associated\n\np. 71\n\nwith certain ideas in the mind of almost every one? Certain symbols are\nuniversally prevalent. Many of you may think that the cross first came into\nexistence as a symbol in connection with the Christian religion; but as a\nmatter of fact it existed before Christianity was, before Moses was born,\nbefore the _Vedas_ were given out, before there was any human record of human\nthings. The cross may be found to have been in existence among the Aztecs and\nthe Phoenicians: every race seems to have had the cross. Again the symbol of\nthe crucified Saviour, of a man crucified upon a cross, appears to have been\nknown to almost every nation. The circle has been a great symbol throughout\nthe world. Then there is the most universal of all symbols, the _Swastika_. At\none time it was thought that the Buddhists carried it all over the world with\nthem, but it has been found out that ages before Buddhism it was used among\nnations. In old Babylon and in Egypt it was to be found. What does this show?\nAll these symbols could not have been purely conventional. There must be some\nreason for them, some natural association between them and the human mind.\nLanguage is not the result of convention; it is not that people ever agreed to\nrepresent certain ideas by certain words; there never was an idea without a\ncorresponding word or a word without a corresponding idea; ideas and words are\nin their nature inseparable. The symbols to represent ideas may be sound\nsymbols or colour symbols. Deaf and dumb people have to think with other than\nsound symbols. Every thought in the mind has a form as its counterpart; this\nis called in Sanskrit philosophy _n ama-rupa_--name and form. It is as\nimpossible to create by convention a system of symbols as it is to create a\nlanguage. In the world\'s ritualistic symbols we have an expression of the\nreligious thought of humanity. It is\n\np. 72\n\neasy to say that there is no use of rituals and temples and all such\nparaphernalia; every baby says that in modern times. But it must be easy for\nall to see that those who worship inside a temple are in many respects\ndifferent from those who will not worship there. Therefore the association of\nparticular temples, rituals and other concrete forms with particular religions\nhas a tendency to bring into the mind of the followers of those religions the\nthoughts for which those concrete things stand as symbols; and it is not wise\nto ignore rituals and symbology altogether. The study and practice of these\nthings form naturally a part of _Karma-Yoga_.\n\nThere are many other aspects of this science of work. One among them is to\nknow the relation between thought and word and what can be achieved by the\npower of the word. In every religion the power of the word is recognised, so\nmuch so that in some of them creation itself is said to have come out of the\nword. The external aspect of the thought of God is the Word, and, as God\nthought and willed before He created, creation came out of the Word. In this\nstress and hurry of our materialistic life our nerves lose sensibility and\nbecome hardened. The older we grow, the longer we are knocked about in the\nworld, the more callous we become; and we are apt to neglect things that even\nhappen persistently and prominently around us. Human nature, however, asserts\nitself sometimes and we are led to inquire into and wonder at some of these\ncommon occurrences; wondering thus is the first step in the acquisition of\nlight. Apart from the higher philosophic and religious value of the Word we\nmay see that sound symbols play a prominent part in the drama of human life. I\nam talking to you. I am not touching you; the pulsations of the air caused by\nmy speaking go into your ear, they touch your nerves and produce effects in\nyour minds. You cannot resist this. What can be more wonderful than this? One\nman calls\n\np. 73\n\nanother a fool, and this other stands up and clenches his fist and lands a\nblow on his nose. Look at the power of the word! There is a woman weeping and\nmiserable; another woman comes along and speaks to her a few gentle words; the\ndoubled up frame of the weeping woman becomes straightened at once, her sorrow\nis gone and she already begins to smile. Think of the power of words! They are\na great force in higher philosophy as well as in common life. Day and night we\nmanipulate this force without thought and without enquiry. To know the nature\nof this force and to use it well is also a part of _Karma-Yoga_.\n\nOur duty to others means helping others; doing good to the world. Why should\nwe do good to the world? Apparently to help the world, but really to help\nourselves. We should always try to help the world, that should be the highest\nmotive in us; but if we consider well, we find that the world does not require\nour help at all. This world was not made that you or I should come and help\nit. I once read a sermon in which was said:--"All this beautiful world is very\ngood, because it gives us time and opportunity to help others." Apparently,\nthis is a very beautiful sentiment, but is it not a blasphemy to say that the\nworld needs our help? We cannot deny that there is much misery in it; to go\nout and help others is, therefore, the best thing we can do, although, in the\nlong run, we shall find that helping others is only helping ourselves. As a\nboy I had some white mice. They were kept in a little box which had little\nwheels made for them, and when the mice tried to cross the wheels, the wheels\nturned and turned, and the mice never got anywhere. So it is with the world\nand our helping it. The only help is that we get moral exercise. This world is\nneither good nor evil; each man manufactures a world for himself. If a blind\nman begins to think of the world, it is either as soft or hard, or as cold or\nhot. We are a mass of happiness\n\np. 74\n\nor misery; we have seen that hundreds of times in our lives. As a rule, the\nyoung are optimistic and the old. pessimistic. The young have life before\nthem; the old complain their day is gone; hundreds of desires, which they\ncannot fulfil, struggle in their hearts. Both are foolish nevertheless. Life\nis good or evil according to the state of mind in which we look at it, it is\nneither by itself. Fire, by itself, is neither good nor evil. \'When it keeps\nus warm we say:--"How beautiful is fire!" When it burns our fingers we blame\nit. Still, in itself it is neither good nor bad. According as we use it, it\nproduces in us the feeling of good or bad; so also is this world. It is\nperfect. By perfection is meant that it is perfectly fitted to meet its ends.\nWe may all be perfectly sure that it will go on beautifully well without us,\nand we need not bother our heads wishing to help it.\n\nYet we must do good; the desire to do good is the highest motive power we\nhave, if we know all the time that it is a privilege to help others. Do not\nstand on a high pedestal and take five cents in your hand and say, "Here, my\npoor man," but be grateful that the poor man is there, so that by making a\ngift to him you are able to help yourself. It is not the receiver that is\nblessed, but it is the giver. Be thankful that you are allowed to exercise\nyour power of benevolence and mercy in the world, and thus become pure and\nperfect. All good acts tend to make us pure and perfect. What can we do at\nbest? Build a hospital, make roads, or erect charity asylums! We may organise\na charity and collect two or three millions of dollars, build a hospital with\none million, with the second give balls and drink champagne, and of the third\nlet the officers steal half, and leave the rest finally to reach the poor; but\nwhat are all these? One mighty wind in five minutes can break all your\nbuildings up. What shall we do then? One volcanic eruption may sweep away all\nour roads and hospitals and cities and\n\np. 75\n\nbuildings. Let us give up all this foolish talk of doing good to the world. It\nis not waiting for your or my help; yet we must work and constantly do good,\nbecause it is a blessing to ourselves. That is the only way we can become\nperfect. No beggar whom we have helped has ever owed a single cent to us; we\nowe everything to him, because he has allowed us to exercise our charity on\nhim. It is entirely wrong to think that we have done, or can do, good to the\nworld, or to think that we have helped such and such people. It is a foolish\nthought, and all foolish thoughts bring misery. We think that we have helped\nsome man and expect him to thank us; and because he does not, unhappiness\ncomes to us. Why should we expect anything in return for what we do? Be\ngrateful to the man you help, think of him as God. Is it not a great privilege\nto be allowed to worship God by helping our fellow-man? If we were really\nunattached, we should escape all this pain of vain expectation, and could\ncheerfully do good work in the world. Never will unhappiness or misery come\nthrough work done without attachment. The world will go on with its happiness\nand misery through eternity.\n\nThere was a poor man who wanted some money; and, somehow, he had heard that if\nhe could get hold of a ghost, he might command him to bring money or anything\nelse he liked; so he was very anxious to get hold of a ghost. He went about\nsearching for a man who would give him a ghost; and at last he found a sage,\nwith great powers, and besought his help. The sage asked him what he would do\nwith a ghost. "I want a ghost to work for me; teach me how to get hold of one,\nsir; I desire it very much," replied the man. But the sage said, "Don\'t\ndisturb yourself, go home." The next day the man went again to the sage and\nbegan to weep and pray, "Give me a ghost; I must have a ghost, sir, to help\nme." At last the sage was disgusted, and said, "Take this charm,\n\np. 76\n\nrepeat this magic word, and a ghost will come, and whatever you say to him he\nwill do. But beware; they are terrible beings, and must be kept continually\nbusy. If you fail to give him work he will take your life." The man replied,\n"That is easy; I can give him work for all his life." Then he went to a\nforest, and after long repetition of the magic word, a huge ghost appeared\nbefore him, and said, "I am a ghost; I have been conquered by your magic; but\nyou must keep me constantly employed; the moment you fail to give me work I\nwill kill you." The man said, "Build me a palace," and the ghost said, "It is\ndone; the palace is built." "Bring me money," said the man. "Here is your\nmoney," said the ghost. "Cut this forest down, and build a city in its place."\n"That is done," said the ghost; "anything more?" Now the man began to be\nfrightened and thought he could give him nothing more to do; he does\neverything in a trice. The ghost said, "Give me something to do or I will eat\nyou up." The poor man could find no further occupation for him, and was\nfrightened. So he ran and ran and at last reached the sage, and said, "Oh sir,\nprotect my life!" The sage asked him what the matter was, and the man replied,\n"I have nothing to give the ghost to do. Everything I tell him to do he does\nin a moment, and he threatens to eat me up if I do not give him work." Just\nthen the ghost arrived, saying, "I\'ll eat you up," and he would have swallowed\nthe man. The man began to shake, and begged the sage to save his life. The\nsage said, "I will find you a way out. Look at that dog with a curly tail.\nDraw your sword quickly and cut the tail off and give it to the ghost to\nstraighten out." The man cut off the dog\'s tail and gave it to the ghost,\nsaying, "Straighten that out for me." The ghost took it and slowly and\ncarefully straightened it out, but as soon as he let it go, it instantly\ncurled up again. Once more he laboriously straightened it out, only to find\n\np. 77\n\nit again curled up as soon as he attempted to let go of it. Again he patiently\nstraightened it out but as soon as he let it go, it curled up again. So he\nwent on for days and days, until he was exhausted and said, "I was never in\nsuch trouble before in my life. I am an old veteran ghost, but never before\nwas I in such trouble. I will make a compromise with you," he said to the man.\n"You let me off and I will let you keep all I have given you and will promise\nnot to harm you. The man was much pleased, and accepted the offer gladly.\n\nThis world is like a dog\'s curly tail, and people have been striving to\nstraighten it out, for hundreds of years; but when they let it go, it has\ncurled up again. How could it be otherwise? One must first know how to work\nwithout attachment, then he will not be a fanatic. When we know that this\nworld is like a dog\'s curly tail and will never get\n[straightened](errata.htm#2), we shall not become fanatics. If there were no\nfanaticism in the world it would make much more progress than it does now. It\nis a mistake to think that fanaticism can make for the progress of mankind. On\nthe contrary it is a retarding element creating hatred and anger, and causing\npeople to fight each other, and making them unsympathetic. We think that\nwhatever we do or possess is the best in the world, and what we do not do or\npossess is of no value. So, always remember the instance of the curly tail of\nthe dog whenever you have a tendency to become a fanatic. You need not worry\nor make yourself sleepless about the world; it will go on without you. When\nyou have avoided fanaticism then alone will you work well. It is the level-\nheaded man, the calm man, of good judgment and cool nerves, of great sympathy\nand love, who does good work and so does good to himself. The fanatic is\nfoolish and has no sympathy; he can never straighten the world, nor himself\nbecome pure and perfect.\n\nTo recapitulate the chief points in to-day\'s lecture.\n\np. 78\n\n[paragraph continues] Firstly, we have to bear in mind that we are all debtors\nto the world and the world does not owe us anything. It is a great privilege\nfor all of us to be allowed to do anything for the world. In helping the world\nwe really help ourselves. The second point is that there is a God in this\nuniverse. It is not true that this universe is drifting and stands in need of\nhelp from you and me. God is ever present therein, He is undying and eternally\nactive and infinitely watchful. When the whole universe sleeps He sleeps not;\nHe is working incessantly; all the changes and manifestations of the world are\nHis. Thirdly, we ought not to hate any one. This world will always continue to\nbe a mixture of good and evil. Our duty is to sympathise with the weak and to\nlove even the wrongdoer. The world is a grand moral gymnasium wherein we have\nall to take exercise so as to become stronger and stronger spiritually.\nFourthly, we ought not to be fanatics of any kind because fanaticism is\nopposed to love. You hear fanatics glibly saying, "I do not hate the sinner, I\nhate the sin;" but I am prepared to go any distance to see the face of that\nman who can really make a distinction between the sin and the sinner. It is\neasy to say so. If we can distinguish well between quality and substance we\nmay become perfect men. It is not easy to do this. And further, the calmer we\nare and the less disturbed our nerves, the more shall we love and the better\nwill our work be.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VI.
