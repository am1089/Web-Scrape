And because that (Brahman) which is referred to in the mantra is declared\n(to be the anandamaya).\n\nThat Brahman which is described in the mantra, 'True Being, knowledge,\ninfinite is Biahman,' is proclaimed as the Self abounding in bliss. And that\nBrahman is the highest Brahman, other than the individual soul; for the\npassage 'He who knows Brahman attains the Highest' refers to Brahman as\nsomething to be obtained by the individual soul, and the words 'On this the\nfollowing verse is recorded' show that the verse is related to that same\nBrahman. The mantra thus is meant to render clear the meaning of the Brahma\n_n_ a passage. Now the Brahman to be reached by the meditating Devotee must be\nsomething different from him. The same point is rendered clear by all the\nfollowing Brahma _n_ a passages and mantras: 'from that same Self sprang\nether,' and so on. The Self abounding in bliss therefore is other than the\nindividual soul.\n\nHere an opponent argues as follows:--We indeed must acknowledge that the\nobject to be reached is something different from the meditating Devotee; but\nthe fact is that the Brahman described in the mantra does not substantially\ndiffer from the individual soul; that Brahman is nothing but the soul of the\nDevotee in its pure state, consisting of mere non-differenced intelligence,\nfree from all shade of Nescience. To this pure condition it is reduced in the\nmantra describing it as true Being, knowledge, infinite. A subsequent passage,\n'that from which all speech, with the mind, turns away, unable to reach it'\n(II. 9), expresses this\n\np. 234\n\nsame state of non-differentiation, describing it as lying beyond mind and\nspeech. It is this therefore to which the mantra refers, and the Self of bliss\nis identical with it.--To this view the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 17.
