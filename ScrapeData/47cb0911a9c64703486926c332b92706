On account of (the individual Soul) going to the Self (the Self cannot be\nthe pradhana).\n\nWith reference to the cause denoted by the word \'Sat,\' Scripture says, \'When a\nman sleeps here, then, my dear, he becomes united with the Sat, he is gone to\nhis own (Self). Therefore they say of him, "he sleeps" (svapiti), because he\nis gone to his own (svam apita).\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 1.) This passage explains\nthe well-known verb \'to sleep,\' with reference to the soul. The word, \'his\nown,\' denotes the Self which had before been denoted by the word Sat; to the\nSelf he (the individual soul) goes, i.e. into it it is resolved, according to\nthe acknowledged sense of api-i, which means \'to be resolved into.\' The\nindividual soul ( _g_ iva) is called awake as long as being connected with the\nvarious external objects by means of the modifications of the mind--which thus\nconstitute limiting adjuncts of the soul--it apprehends those external\nobjects, and identifies itself with the gross body, which is one of those\nexternal objects 1. When, modified by the impressions which the external\nobjects have left, it sees dreams, it is denoted by the term \'mind 2.\' When,\non the cessation of the two limiting adjuncts (i.e. the subtle and the gross\nbodies), and the consequent absence of the modifications due to the adjuncts,\nit is, in the state of deep sleep, merged in the Self as it were, then it is\nsaid to be asleep (resolved into the Self). A similar etymology of the word \'h\n_ri_ daya\' is given by _s_ ruti, \'That Self abides in the heart. And this is\nthe etymological explanation: he is in the heart (h _ri_ di ayam).\' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VIII, 3, 3.) The words a _s_ anaya and udanya are similarly etymologised:\n\'water is carrying away what has been eaten by him;\' \'fire carries away what\nhas been drunk by him\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 3; 5). Thus the passage quoted above\nexplains the resolution (of the soul) into the Self, denoted by the term\n\'Sat,\' by means of the etymology of the word \'sleep.\' But the intelligent\n\np. 60\n\n[paragraph continues] Self can clearly not resolve itself into the non-\nintelligent pradhana. If, again, it were said that the pradhana is denoted by\nthe word \'own,\' because belonging to the Self (as being the Self\'s own), there\nwould remain the same absurd statement as to an intelligent entity being\nresolved into a non-intelligent one. Moreover another scriptural passage (viz.\n\'embraced by the intelligent--pra _g \xc3\xb1_a--Self he knows nothing that is\nwithout, nothing that is within,\' B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 21) declares that the\nsoul in the condition of dreamless sleep is resolved into an intelligent\nentity. Hence that into which all intelligent souls are resolved is an\nintelligent cause of the world, denoted by the word \'Sat,\' and not the\npradhana.--A further reason for the pradhana not being the cause is subjoined.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[59:1](sbe34015.htm#fr_102) So according to the commentators, not to accept\nwhose guidance in the translation of scholastic definitions is rather\nhazardous. A simpler translation of the clause might however be given.\n\n[59:2](sbe34015.htm#fr_103) With reference to _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 10](sbe34016.htm)\n\n'
