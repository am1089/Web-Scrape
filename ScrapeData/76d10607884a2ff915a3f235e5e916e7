We women are sitting\nthere, on one side, behind a screen. Triumphant shouts of _Bande Mataram_ come\nnearer: and to them I am thrilling through and through. Suddenly a stream of\nbarefooted youths in turbans, clad in ascetic ochre, rushes into the\nquadrangle, like a silt-reddened freshet into a dry river-bed at the first\nburst of the rains. The whole place is filled with an immense crowd, through\nwhich Sandip Babu is borne, seated in a big chair hoisted on the shoulders of\nten or twelve of the youths.\n\n_\n\nBande Mataram! Bande Mataram! Bande Mataram_! It seems as though the skies\nwould be rent and scattered into a thousand fragments.\n\nI had seen Sandip Babu\'s photograph before. There was something in his\nfeatures which I did not quite like. Not that he was bad-looking--far from it:\nhe had a splendidly handsome face. Yet, I know not why, it seemed to me, in\nspite of all its brilliance, that too much of base alloy had gone into its\nmaking. The light in his eyes somehow did not shine true. That was why I did\nnot like it when my husband unquestioningly gave in to all his demands. I\ncould bear the waste of money; but it vexed me to think that he was imposing\non my husband, taking advantage of friendship. His bearing was not that of an\nascetic, nor even of a person of moderate means, but foppish all over. Love of\ncomfort seemed to ... any number of such reflections come back to me today,\nbut let them be.\n\nWhen, however, Sandip Babu began to speak that afternoon, and the hearts of\nthe crowd swayed and surged to his words, as though they would break all\nbounds, I saw him wonderfully transformed. Especially when his features were\nsuddenly lit up by a shaft of light from the slowly setting sun, as it sunk\nbelow the roof-line of the pavilion, he seemed to me to be marked out by the\ngods as their messenger to mortal men and women.\n\nFrom beginning to end of his speech, each one of his utterances was a stormy\noutburst. There was no limit to the confidence of his assurance. I do not know\nhow it happened, but I found I had impatiently pushed away the screen from\nbefore me and had fixed my gaze upon him. Yet there was none in that crowd who\npaid any heed to my doings. Only once, I noticed, his eyes, like stars in\nfateful Orion, flashed full on my face.\n\nI was utterly unconscious of myself. I was no longer the lady of the Rajah\'s\nhouse, but the sole representative of Bengal\'s womanhood. And he was the\nchampion of Bengal. As the sky had shed its light over him, so he must receive\nthe consecration of a woman\'s benediction ...\n\nIt seemed clear to me that, since he had caught sight of me, the fire in his\nwords had flamed up more fiercely. Indra\'s  11 steed refused to be reined in,\nand there came the roar of thunder and the flash of lightning. I said within\nmyself that his language had caught fire from my eyes; for we women are not\nonly the deities of the household fire, but the flame of the soul itself.\n\nI returned home that evening radiant with a new pride and joy. The storm\nwithin me had shifted my whole being from one centre to another. Like the\nGreek maidens of old, I fain would cut off my long, resplendent tresses to\nmake a bowstring for my hero. Had my outward ornaments been connected with my\ninner feelings, then my necklet, my armlets, my bracelets, would all have\nburst their bonds and flung themselves over that assembly like a shower of\nmeteors. Only some personal sacrifice, I felt, could help me to bear the\ntumult of my exaltation.\n\nWhen my husband came home later, I was trembling lest he should utter a sound\nout of tune with the triumphant paean which was still ringing in my ears, lest\nhis fanaticism for truth should lead him to express disapproval of anything\nthat had been said that afternoon. For then I should have openly defied and\nhumiliated him. But he did not say a word ... which I did not like either.\n\nHe should have said: "Sandip has brought me to my senses. I now realize how\nmistaken I have been all this time."\n\nI somehow felt that he was spitefully silent, that he obstinately refused to\nbe enthusiastic. I asked how long Sandip Babu was going to be with us.\n\n"He is off to Rangpur early tomorrow morning," said my husband.\n\n"Must it be tomorrow?"\n\n"Yes, he is already engaged to speak there."\n\nI was silent for a while and then asked again: "Could he not possibly stay a\nday longer?"\n\n"That may hardly be possible, but why?"\n\n"I want to invite him to dinner and attend on him myself."\n\nMy husband was surprised. He had often entreated me to be present when he had\nparticular friends to dinner, but I had never let myself be persuaded. He\ngazed at me curiously, in silence, with a look I did not quite understand.\n\nI was suddenly overcome with a sense of shame. "No, no," I exclaimed, "that\nwould never do!"\n\n"Why not!" said he. "I will ask him myself, and if it is at all possible he\nwill surely stay on for tomorrow."\n\nIt turned out to be quite possible.\n\nI will tell the exact truth. That day I reproached my Creator because he had\nnot made me surpassingly beautiful--not to steal any heart away, but because\nbeauty is glory. In this great day the men of the country should realize its\ngoddess in its womanhood. But, alas, the eyes of men fail to discern the\ngoddess, if outward beauty be lacking. Would Sandip Babu find the _Shakti_ of\nthe Motherland manifest in me? Or would he simply take me to be an ordinary,\ndomestic woman?\n\nThat morning I scented my flowing hair and tied it in a loose knot, bound by a\ncunningly intertwined red silk ribbon. Dinner, you see, was to be served at\nmidday, and there was no time to dry my hair after my bath and do it up\nplaited in the ordinary way. I put on a gold-bordered white _sari_ , and my\nshort-sleeve muslin jacket was also gold-bordered.\n\nI felt that there was a certain restraint about my costume and that nothing\ncould well have been simpler. But my sister-in-law, who happened to be passing\nby, stopped dead before me, surveyed me from head to foot and with compressed\nlips smiled a meaning smile. When I asked her the reason, "I am admiring your\nget-up!" she said.\n\n"What is there so entertaining about it?" I enquired, considerably annoyed.\n\n"It\'s superb," she said. "I was only thinking that one of those low-necked\nEnglish bodices would have made it perfect." Not only her mouth and eyes, but\nher whole body seemed to ripple with suppressed laughter as she left the room.\n\nI was very, very angry, and wanted to change everything and put on my everyday\nclothes. But I cannot tell exactly why I could not carry out my impulse. Women\nare the ornaments of society-- thus I reasoned with myself--and my husband\nwould never like it, if I appeared before Sandip Babu unworthily clad.\n\nMy idea had been to make my appearance after they had sat down to dinner. In\nthe bustle of looking after the serving the first awkwardness would have\npassed off. But dinner was not ready in time, and it was getting late.\nMeanwhile my husband had sent for me to introduce the guest.\n\nI was feeling horribly shy about looking Sandip Babu in the face. However, I\nmanaged to recover myself enough to say: "I am so sorry dinner is getting\nlate."\n\nHe boldly came and sat right beside me as he replied: "I get a dinner of some\nkind every day, but the Goddess of Plenty keeps behind the scenes. Now that\nthe goddess herself has appeared, it matters little if the dinner lags\nbehind."\n\nHe was just as emphatic in his manners as he was in his public speaking. He\nhad no hesitation and seemed to be accustomed to occupy, unchallenged, his\nchosen seat. He claimed the right to intimacy so confidently, that the blame\nwould seem to belong to those who should dispute it.\n\nI was in terror lest Sandip Babu should take me for a shrinking, old-fashioned\nbundle of inanity. But, for the life of me, I could not sparkle in repartees\nsuch as might charm or dazzle him. What could have possessed me, I angrily\nwondered, to appear before him in such an absurd way?\n\nI was about to retire when dinner was over, but Sandip Babu, as bold as ever,\nplaced himself in my way.\n\n"You must not," he said, "think me greedy. It was not the dinner that kept me\nstaying on, it was your invitation. If you were to run away now, that would\nnot be playing fair with your guest."\n\nIf he had not said these words with a careless ease, they would have been out\nof tune. But, after all, he was such a great friend of my husband that I was\nlike his sister.\n\nWhile I was struggling to climb up this high wave of intimacy, my husband came\nto the rescue, saying: "Why not come back to us after you have taken your\ndinner?"\n\n"But you must give your word," said Sandip Babu, "before we let you off."\n\n"I will come," said I, with a slight smile.\n\n"Let me tell you," continued Sandip Babu, "why I cannot trust you. Nikhil has\nbeen married these nine years, and all this while you have eluded me. If you\ndo this again for another nine years, we shall never meet again."\n\nI took up the spirit of his remark as I dropped my voice to reply: "Why even\nthen should we not meet?"\n\n"My horoscope tells me I am to die early. None of my forefathers have survived\ntheir thirtieth year. I am now twenty-seven."\n\nHe knew this would go home. This time there must have been a shade of concern\nin my low voice as I said: "The blessings of the whole country are sure to\navert the evil influence of the stars."\n\n"Then the blessings of the country must be voiced by its goddess. This is the\nreason for my anxiety that you should return, so that my talisman may begin to\nwork from today."\n\nSandip Babu had such a way of taking things by storm that I got no opportunity\nof resenting what I never should have permitted in another.\n\n"So," he concluded with a laugh, "I am going to hold this husband of yours as\na hostage till you come back."\n\nAs I was coming away, he exclaimed: "May I trouble you for a trifle?"\n\nI started and turned round.\n\n"Don\'t be alarmed," he said. "It\'s merely a glass of water. You might have\nnoticed that I did not drink any water with my dinner. I take it a little\nlater."\n\nUpon this I had to make a show of interest and ask him the reason. He began to\ngive the history of his dyspepsia. I was told how he had been a martyr to it\nfor seven months, and how, after the usual course of nuisances, which included\ndifferent allopathic and homoeopathic misadventures, he had obtained the most\nwonderful results by indigenous methods.\n\n"Do you know," he added, with a smile, "God has built even my infirmities in\nsuch a manner that they yield only under the bombardment of _Swadeshi_ pills."\n\nMy husband, at this, broke his silence. "You must confess," said he, "that you\nhave as immense an attraction for foreign medicine as the earth has for\nmeteors. You have three shelves in your sitting-room full of..."\n\nSandip Babu broke in: "Do you know what they are? They are the punitive\npolice. They come, not because they are wanted, but because they are imposed\non us by the rule of this modern age, exacting fines and-inflicting injuries."\n\nMy husband could not bear exaggerations, and I could see he disliked this. But\nall ornaments are exaggerations. They are not made by God, but by man. Once I\nremember in defence of some untruth of mine I said to my husband: "Only the\ntrees and beasts and birds tell unmitigated truths, because these poor things\nhave not the power to invent. In this men show their superiority to the lower\ncreatures, and women beat even men. Neither is a profusion of ornament\nunbecoming for a woman, nor a profusion of untruth."\n\nAs I came out into the passage leading to the zenana I found my sister-in-law,\nstanding near a window overlooking the reception rooms, peeping through the\nvenetian shutter.\n\n"You here?" I asked in surprise.\n\n"Eavesdropping!" she replied.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[11](hw04.htm#fr_10) The Jupiter Pluvius of Hindu mythology.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V](hw05.htm)\n\n'
