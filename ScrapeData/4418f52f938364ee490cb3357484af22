LET a man meditate on the syllable 2 Om, called the udgitha; for the\nudgitha (a portion of the Sama-veda) is sung, beginning with Om.\n\nThe full account, however, of Om is this:--\n\n2\\. The essence 3 of all beings is the earth, the essence of the earth is\nwater, the essence of water\n\np. 2\n\nthe plants, the essence of plants man, the essence of man speech, the essence\nof speech the Rig-veda, the essence of the Rig-veda the Sama-veda 1, the\nessence of the Sama-veda the udgitha (which is Om).\n\n3\\. That udgitha (Om) is the best of all essences, the highest, deserving the\nhighest place 2, the eighth.\n\n4\\. What then is the _Ri_ _k_? What is the Saman? What is the udgitha? 'This\nis the question.\n\n5\\. The _Ri_ _k_ indeed is speech, Saman is breath, the udgitha is the\nsyllable Om. Now speech and breath, or _Ri_ _k_ and Saman, form one couple.\n\n6\\. And that couple is joined together in the syllable Om. When two people\ncome together, they fulfil each other's desire.\n\n7\\. Thus he who knowing this, meditates on the syllable (Om), the udgitha,\nbecomes indeed a fulfiller of desires.\n\n8\\. That syllable is a syllable of permission, for whenever we permit\nanything, we say Om, yes. Now permission is gratification. He who knowing this\nmeditates on the syllable (Om), the udgitha, becomes indeed a gratifier of\ndesires.\n\n9\\. By that syllable does the threefold knowledge (the sacrifice, more\nparticularly the Soma-sacrifice, as founded on the three Vedas) proceed. When\nthe Adhvaryu priest gives an order, he says Om. When the Hot _ri_ priest\nrecites, he says Om. When the Udgat _ri_ priest sings, he says Om,\n\np. 3\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--all for the glory of that syllable. The threefold\nknowledge (the sacrifice) proceeds by the greatness of that syllable (the\nvital breaths), and by its essence (the oblations) 1.\n\n10\\. Now therefore it would seem to follow, that both he who knows this (the\ntrue meaning of the syllable Om), and he who does not, perform the same\nsacrifice 2. But this is not so, for knowledge and ignorance are different.\nThe sacrifice which a man performs with knowledge, faith, and the Upanishad 3\nis more powerful. This is the full account of the syllable Om.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](sbe01022.htm#fr_69) The _Kh_ andogya-upanishad begins with recommending\nmeditation on the syllable Om, a sacred syllable that had to be pronounced at\nthe beginning of each Veda and of every recitation of Vedic hymns. As\nconnected with the Sama-veda, that syllable Om is called udgitha. Its more\nusual name is pra _n_ ava. The object of the Upanishad is to explain the\nvarious meanings which the syllable Om may assume in the mind of a devotee,\nsome of them being extremely artificial and senseless, till at last the\nhighest meaning of Om is reached, viz. Brahman, the intelligent cause of the\nuniverse.\n\n[1:2](sbe01022.htm#fr_70) Akshara means both syllable and the imperishable,\ni.e. Brahman.\n\n[1:3](sbe01022.htm#fr_71) Essence, rasa, is explained in different ways, as\norigin, support, end, cause, and effect. Rasa means originally the sap of\ntrees. That sap may be conceived either as the essence extracted from the\ntree, or as what gives vigour and life to a tree. In the former case it might\nbe transferred to the conception of effect, in the latter to that of cause. In\nour sentence it has sometimes the one, sometimes the other meaning. Earth is\nthe support of all beings, water pervades the earth, plants arise from water,\nman lives by plants, speech is the best part of man, the Rig-veda the best\npart of speech, the Sama-veda the best extract from the _Ri_ _k_ , udgitha, or\nthe syllable Om, the crown of the Sama-veda.\n\n[2:1](sbe01022.htm#fr_72) Because most of the hymns of the Sama-veda are taken\nfrom the Rig-veda.\n\n[2:2](sbe01022.htm#fr_73) Parardhya is here derived from para, highest, and\nardha, place. The eighth means the eighth or East in the series of essences.\n\n[3:1](sbe01022.htm#fr_74) These are allusions to sacrificial technicalities,\nall intended to show the importance of the syllable Om, partly as a mere word,\nused at the sacrifices, partly as the mysterious name of the Highest Self. As\nevery priest at the Soma-sacrifices, in which three classes of priests are\nalways engaged, has to begin his part of the ceremonial with Om, therefore the\nwhole sacrifice is said to be dependent on the syllable Om, and to be for the\nglory of that syllable, as an emblem of the Highest Self, a knowledge of whom\nis the indirect result of all sacrifices. The greatness of the syllable Om is\nexplained by the vital breaths of the priest, the sacrificer, and his wife;\nits essence by rice, corn, &c., which constitute the oblations. Why breath and\nfood are due to the syllable Om is explained by the sacrifice, which is\ndependent on that syllable, ascending to the sun, the sun sending rain, rain\nproducing food, and food producing breath and life.\n\n[3:2](sbe01022.htm#fr_75) He who simply pronounces the syllable Om as part of\nhis recitation at a sacrifice, and he who knows the hidden meaning of that\nsyllable, both may perform the same sacrifice. But that performed by the\nlatter is more powerful, because knowledge is better than ignorance. This is,\nas usual, explained by some comparisons. It is true that both he who knows the\nquality of the haritaki and he who does not, are purged alike if they take it.\nBut on the other hand, if a jeweller and a mere clod sell a precious stone,\nthe knowledge of the former bears better fruit than the ignorance of the\nlatter.\n\n[3:3](sbe01022.htm#fr_76) Upanishad is here explained by yoga, and yoga by\ndevatadivishayam upasanam, meditation directed to certain deities, More p. 4\nlikely, however, it refers to this very upanishad, i.e. to the udgithavidya,\nthe doctrine of the secret meaning of Om, as here explained.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2](sbe01023.htm)\n\n"
