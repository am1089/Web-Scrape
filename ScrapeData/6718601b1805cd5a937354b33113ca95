The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93O King! O Mighty armed One! All these I grant unto\nyou. Whatever you have asked for, I give them to you. I am very much pleased\nwith your hard Tapasya and with your Japam of the Vagbhava Mantra. Know Me\nthat My power is infallible in killing the Lords of the Daityas. O Child! Let\nyour kingdom be free from enemies and let your prosperity be increased. Let\nyour devotion be fixed on Me and in the end you will verily get Nirva _n_ a\nMukti.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Thus granting the boon to the highsouled Manu the Great Devi\ndisappeared before him and went to the Bindhya Range. O Devar _s_ i! This\nBindhya mountain increased in height so much so that it was well nigh on the\nway to prevent the course of the Sun when it was arrested by Mahar _s_ i\nAgastya, born of a kumbha (water jar). The younger sister of Vi _sn_ u,\nVarades'vari, is staying here as Bindhyavasini. O Best of the Munis! This Devi\nis an object of worship of all.\n\n\n\np. 1024\n\n\n\n7-8. Saunaka and the other Ri _s_ is said :-- O Suta! Who is that Bindhya\nMountain? And why did He intend to soar high up to the Heavens to resist the\nSun's course? And why was it that Agastya, the son of Mitravaru _n_ a\nquietened that rising mountain? Kindly describe all these in detail.\n\n\n\n9-15. O Saint! We are not as yet satisfied with hearing the Glories of the\nDevi, the ambrosial nectar, that have come out of your mouth. Rather our\nthirst has been increased. Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! There was the Bindhya\nMountain, highly honoured and reckoned as the chief of the mountains on the\nearth. It was covered with big forests and big trees. Creeping plants and\nshrubs flowered these and it looked very beautiful. On it were roaming deer,\nwild boars, buffaloes, monkeys, hares, foxes, tigers and bears, stout and\ncheerful, with full vigour and all very merrily. The Devas, Gandharbhas,\nApsaras, and Kinnaras come here and bathe in its rivers; all sorts of fruit\ntrees can be seen here. On such a beautiful Bindhya Mountain, came there one\nday the ever joyful Devar _s_ i Narada on his voluntary tour round the world.\nSeeing the Mahar _s_ i Narada, the Bindhya Mountain got up and worshipped him\nwith padya and arghya and gave him a very good \xc3\x82sana to sit. When the Muni\ntook his seat and found himself happy, the Mountain began to speak.\n\n\n\n16-17. Bindhya said :-- \xc2\x93O Devar _s_ i! Now be pleased to say whence you are\ncoming; your coming here is so very auspicious! My house is sanctified today\nby your coming. O Deva! Your wandering is, like the Sun, the cause of\ninspiring the beings with freedom from fear. So, O Narada! Kindly give out\nyour intention as to your coming here which seems rather wonderful.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n18-28. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Bindhya! O Enemy of Indra! (Once the mountains had a\nvery great influence. Indra cut off their wings and so destroyed their\ninfluence. Hence the mountains are enemies of Indra). I am coming from the\nSumeru Mountain. There I saw the nice abodes of Indra, Agni, Yama, and Varu\n_n_ a. There I saw the houses of these Dikpalas (the Regents of the several\nquarters), which abound in objects of all sorts of enjoyments.\xc2\x94 Thus saying,\nNarada gave out a heavy sigh. Bindhya, the king of mountains, seeing the Muni\nheaving a long sigh, asked him again with great eagerness, \xc2\x93O Devar _s_ i! Why\nhave you heaved such a long sigh? Kindly say.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, Narada said :--\n\xc2\x93O Child! Hear the cause why I sighed. See! The Himalaya Mountain is the\nfather of Gauri and the father-in-law of Mahadeva; therefore he is the most\nworshipped of all the mountains. The Kailas'a Mountain again, is the residence\nof Mahadeva; hence that is also\n\n\n\np. 1025\n\n\n\nworshipped and chanted as capable of destroying all the sins. So the Ni _s_\nadha, Nila, and Gandhamadana and other mountains are worshipped at their own\nplaces. What more than this, that the Sumeru Mountain, round whom the\nthousand-rayed Sun, the Soul of the universe, circumambulates along with the\nplanets and stars, thinks himself the supreme and greatest amongst the\nmountains, \xc2\x93I am the supreme; there is none like me in the three worlds.\xc2\x94\nRemembering this self-conceit of Sumeru, I sighed so heavily. O Bindhya! We\nare asceties and though we have no need to discuss these things, yet by way of\nconversation I have told this to you. Now I go to my own abode.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Second Chapter of the Tenth Book on the conversation between\nNarada and the Bindhya Mountain in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3](bk10ch03.htm)\n\n"
