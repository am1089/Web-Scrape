On account of the other (i.e. the individual soul) being designated (as\nnon-different from Brahman) there would attach (to Brahman) various faults,\nas, for instance, not doing what is beneficial.\n\nAnother objection is raised against the doctrine of an intelligent cause of\nthe world.--If that doctrine is accepted, certain faults, as, for instance,\ndoing what is not beneficial, will attach (to the intelligent cause, i.e.\nBrahman), 'on account of the other being designated.' For Scripture declares\nthe other, i.e. the embodied soul, to be one with Brahman, as is shown by the\npassage, 'That is the Self; that art thou, O _S_ vetaketu!' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8,\n7.)--Or else (if we interpret 'the other' of the Sutra in a different way)\nScripture declares the other, i. e. Brahman, to be the Self of the embodied\nsoul. For the passage, 'Having created that he entered into it,' declares the\ncreator, i. e. the unmodified Brahman, to constitute the Self of the embodied\nsoul, in consequence of his entering into his products. The following passage\nalso, 'Entering (into them) with this living Self I will evolve names and\nforms' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2), in which the highest divinity designates the\nliving (soul) by the word 'Self,' shows that the embodied Self is not\ndifferent from Brahman. Therefore the creative power of Brahman belongs to the\nembodied Self also, and the latter, being thus an independent agent, might be\nexpected to produce only what is beneficial to itself, and not things of a\ncontrary nature, such as birth, death, old age, disease, and whatever may be\nthe other meshes of the net of suffering. For we know that no free person will\nbuild a prison for himself, and take up his abode in it. Nor would a being,\nitself absolutely stainless,\n\np. 344\n\nlook on this altogether unclean body as forming part of its Self. It would,\nmoreover, free itself, according to its liking, of the consequences of those\nof its former actions which result in pain, and would enjoy the consequences\nof those actions only which are rewarded by pleasure. Further, it would\nremember that it had created this manifold world; for every person who has\nproduced some clearly appearing effect remembers that he has been the cause of\nit. And as the magician easily retracts, whenever he likes, the magical\nillusion which he had emitted, so the embodied soul also would be able to\nreabsorb this world into itself. The fact is, however, that the embodied soul\ncannot reabsorb its own body even. As we therefore see that 'what would be\nbeneficial is not done,' the hypothesis of the world having proceeded from an\nintelligent cause is unacceptable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 22](sbe34161.htm)\n\n"
