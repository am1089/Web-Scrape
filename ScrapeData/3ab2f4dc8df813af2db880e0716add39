I have now narrated the anecdote of _S_ a\n_st_ hi as stated in the Vedas. Now hear the anecdote of Mangala Cha _nd_ i,\napproved of by the Vedas and respected by the literary persons. The Cha _nd_\ni, that is very skilled in all auspicious works and who is the most auspicious\nof all good things, is Mangal Cha _nd_ ika. Or the Cha _nd_ i who is an object\nof worship of Mangala (Mars), the son of earth and the bestower of desires is\nMangala Cha _nd_ ika. Or the Cha _nd_ i who is an object of worship of Mangala\nof the family of Manu who was the ruler of the whole world composed of seven\nislands and the bestower of all desires is Mangala Cha _nd_ i. Or it may be\nthat the Mula Prakriti, the Governess, the Ever Gracious Durga assumed the\nform of Mangala Cha _nd_ i and has become the I _st_ a Devata of women. When\nthere was the fight with Tripurasura, this Mangala Cha _nd_ i, higher than the\nhighest was first worshipped by Mahadeva, stimulated by Vi _sn_ u, on a\ncritical moment. O Brahmi _n_! While the fighting was going on, a Daitya threw\nout of anger one car on Mahadeva and as that car was about to fall on Him,\nBrahma and Vi _sn_ u gave a good advice when Mahadeva began to praise Durga\nDevi at once. Durga Devi that time assuming the form of Mangala Cha _nd_ i\nappeared and said \xc2\x93no fear no fear\xc2\x94 Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u will be Thy Carrier\nbuffalo. I will be also Thy S\xc2\x92akti in the action and Hari, full of Maya, will\nalso help Thee. Thou better slayest the enemy that dispossessed the Devas. O\nChild! Thus saying, the Devi Mangala\n\n\n\np. 990\n\n\n\nChandi disappeared and She became the S\xc2\x92akti of Maha Deva. Then with the help\nof the weapon given by Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of Uma killed the Asura. When the\nDaitya fell, the Devas and Ri _s_ is began to chant hymns to Mahadeva with\ndevotion and with their heads bent low. From the sky, a shower of flowers fell\ninstantaneously on Maha Deva\xc2\x92s head. Brahma and Vi _sn_ u became glad and gave\ntheir best wishes to Him. Then ordered by Brahma and Vi _sn_ u, S\xc2\x92ankara\nbathed joyously. Then He began to worship with devotion the Devi Mangala Cha\n_nd_ i with padya, Arghya, \xc3\x82chamaniya and various clothings. Flowers, sandal\npaste, various goats, sheep, buffaloes, bisons, birds, garments, ornaments,\ngarlands, Payasa (a preparation of rice, ghee, milk and sugar), Pi _st_ aka,\nhoney, wine, and various fruits were offered in the worship. Dancing, music,\nwith instruments and the chanting of Her name and other festivals commenced.\nReciting the Dhyan as in Madhyandina, Mahadeva offered everything, pronouncing\nthe principal Radical Mantra, \xc2\x93Om Hrim S\xc2\x92rim Klim Sarvapujye Devi Mangala Cha\n_nd_ ike Hum Pha _t_ Svaha\xc2\x94 is the twenty-one lettered Mantra of Mangala Cha\n_nd_ i. During worship, the Kalpa Vrik _s_ a, the tree yielding all desires,\nmust be worshipped. O Narada! By repeating the Mantra ten lakhs of times, the\nMantra Siddhi (success in realising the Deity inherent in the Mantra) comes.\nNow I am saying about the Dhyanam of Mangal Cha _nd_ i as stated in the Vedas\nand as approved by all. Listen. \xc2\x93O Devi Mangala Cha _nd_ ike! Thou art sixteen\nyears old; Thou art ever youthful; Thy lips are like Bimba fruits, Thou art of\ngood teeth and pure. Thy face looks like autumnal lotus; Thy colour is like\nwhite champakas; Thy eyes resemble blue lilies; Thou art the Preserver of the\nworld and thou bestowest all sorts of prosperity. Thou art the Light in this\ndark ocean of the world. So I meditate on Thee.\xc2\x94 This is the Dhyanam. Now hear\nthe stotra, which Mahadeva recited before Her.\n\n\n\n26-37. Mahadeva said :-- Protect me, Protect me, O Mother! O Devi Mangal Cha\n_nd_ ike! Thou, the Destroyer of difficulties! Thou givest joy and good. Thou\nart clever in giving delight and fortune. Thou the bestower of all bliss and\nprosperity! Thou, the auspicious, Thou art Mangala Cha _nd_ ika. Thou art\nMangala, worthy of all good, Thou art the auspicious of all auspicious; Thou\nbestowest good to the good persons. Thou art worthy to be worshipped on\nTuesday (the Mangala day); Thou art the Deity, desired by all. The King\nMangala, born of Manu family always worships Thee. Thou, the presiding Devi of\nMangala; Thou art the repository of all the good that are in this world. Thou,\nthe Bestower of the auspicious Mok _s_ a. Thou, the best of all; Thou, the\nrespository of all good; Thou makest one cross all the Karmas; the people\nworship Thee on every Tuesday; Thou bestowest abundance of Bliss to all. Thus\npraising Mangala Cha _nd_ ika with this stotra, and worshipping on every\n\n\n\np. 991\n\n\n\nTuesday, S\xc2\x92ambhu departed. The Devi Sarva Mangala was first worshipped by\nMahadeva. Next she was worsh ipped by the planet Mars; then by the King\nMangala; then on every Tuesday by the ladies of every household. Fifthly she\nwas worshipped by all men, desirous of their welfare. So in every universe\nMangal Cha _nd_ ika, first worshipped by Mahadeva, came to be worshipped by\nall. Next she came to be worshipped everywhere, by the Devas, Munis, Manavas,\nManus. O Muni! He who hears with undivided attention this stotra of the Devi\nMangala Cha _nd_ ika, finds no evils anywhere. Rather all good comes to him.\nDay after day he gets sons and grandsons and so his prosperity gets increased,\nyea, verily increased!\n\n\n\n38-58. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! Thus I narrated to you the stories of\n_S_ a _st_ hi and Mangala Cha _nd_ ika, according to the Vedas. Now hear the\nstory of Manasa that I heard from the mouth of Dharama Deva.\n\n\n\nManasa is the mind-born daughter of Mahar _s_ i Kas\xc2\x92yapa; hence she is named\nManasa; or it may be She who plays with the mind is Manasa. Or it may be She\nwho meditates on God with her mind and gets rapture in Her meditation of God\nis named Manasa. She finds pleasure in Her Own Self, the great devotee of Vi\n_sn_ u, a Siddha Yogini. For three Yugas She worshipped S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a and\nthen She became a Siddha Yogini. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Lord of the Gopis,\nseeing the body of Manasa lean and thin due to austerities, or seeing her worn\nout like the Muni Jarat Karu called her by the name of Jarat Karu. Hence Her\nname has come also to be Jarat Karu. Kri _sn_ a, the Ocean of Mercy, gave her\nout of kindness, Her desired boon; She worshipped Him and S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a also\nworshipped Her. Devi Manasa is known in the Heavens, in the abode of the Nagas\n(serpents), in earth, in Brahmaloka, in all the worlds as of very fair colour,\nbeautiful and charming. She is named Jagad Gauri as she is of a very fair\ncolour in the world. Her other name is S\xc2\x92aivi and she is the disciple of\nS\xc2\x92iva. She is named Vai _sn_ avi as she is greatly devoted to Vi _sn_ u. She\nsaved the Nagas in the Snake Sacrifice performed by Pariksit, she is named\nNages\xc2\x92vari and Naga Bhagini and She is capable to destroy the effects of\npoison. She is called Vi _s_ ahari. She got the Siddha yoga from Mahadeva;\nhence She is named Siddha Yogini; She got from Him the great knowledge, so she\nis called Maha J\xc3\xb1anayuta, and as she got Mritasamjivani (making alive the\ndead) she is known by the name of Mritasanjivani. As the great ascetic is the\nmother of the great Muni \xc3\x82stik, she is known in the world as \xc3\x82stika mata. As\nShe is the dear wife of the great high-souled Yogi Muni Jarat Karu, worshipped\nby all, she is called as Jarat\n\nKarupriya, Jaratkaru, Jagadgauri, Manasa, Siddha Yogini, Vai _sn_ avi,\n\n\n\np. 992\n\n\n\nNaga Bhagini, S'aivi, Nages\xc2\x92vari, Jaratkarupriya, \xc3\x82stikamata, Vi _s_ ahari,\nand Maha J\xc3\xb1anayuta; these are the twelve names of Manasa, worshipped\neverywhere in the Universe. He who recites these twelve names while\nworshipping Manasa Devi, he or any of his family has no fear of snakes. If\nthere be any fear of snakes in one\xc2\x92s bed, if the house be infested with snakes\nor if one goes to a place difficult for fear of snakes or if one\xc2\x92s body be\nencircled with snakes, all the fears are dispelled, if one reads this stotra\nof Manasa. There is no doubt in this. The snakes run away out of fear from the\nsight of him who daily recites the Manasa stotra. Ten lakhs of times repeating\nthe Manasa mantra give one man success in the stotra. He can easily drink\npoison who attains success in this stotra. The snakes become his ornaments;\nthey carry him even on their backs. He who is a great Siddha can sit on a seat\nof snakes and can sleep on a bed of snakes. In the end he sports day and night\nwith Vi _sn_ u.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Forty-seventh Chapter of the Ninth Book on Manasa\xc2\x92s story in the\nMaha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 48](bk09ch48.htm)\n\n"
