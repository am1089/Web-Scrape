(The cognitions) intimated by all the Vedanta-texts (are identical), on\naccount of the non-difference of injunction and so on.\n\nIn the preceding part of this work we have explained the nature of the object\nof cognition, i.e. Brahman. We now enter on the discussion of the question\nwhether the cognitions of Brahman, which form the subject of the different\nVedanta-texts, are separate cognitions or not.\n\nBut, an objection may here be raised, so far we have determined that Brahman\nis free from all distinctions whatever, one, of absolutely uniform nature like\na lump of salt; hence there appears to be no reason for even raising the\nquestion whether the cognitions of Brahman are separate cognitions or\nconstitute only one cognition. For as Brahman is one and of uniform nature, it\ncertainly cannot be maintained that the Vedanta-texts aim at establishing a\nplurality in Brahman comparable to the plurality of works (inculcated by the\nkarmaka _n_ _d_ a of the Veda). Nor can it be said that although Brahman is\nuniform, yet it may be the object of divers cognitions; for any difference in\nnature between the cognition and the object known points to a mistake\ncommitted. If, on the other hand, it should be assumed that the different\nVedanta-texts aim at teaching different cognitions of Brahman, it would follow\nthat only one cognition can be the right one while all others are mistaken,\nand that would lead to a general distrust of all Vedanta.--Hence the question\nwhether each individual Vedanta-text teaches a separate cognition of Brahman\nor not cannot even be raised.--Nor, supposing that question were raised after\nall, can the non-difference of the cognition of Brahman be demonstrated (as\nthe Sutra attempts) on the ground that all Vedanta-texts are equally\ninjunctions, since the cognition of Brahman is not of the nature of an\ninjunction. For the teacher has proved at\n\np. 185\n\nlength (I, 1, 4) that the knowledge of Brahman is produced by passages which\ntreat of Brahman as an existing accomplished thing and thus do not aim at\nenjoining anything.--Why then begin at all this discussion about the\ndifference or non-difference of the cognitions of Brahman?\n\nTo all this we reply that no objection can be raised against a discussion of\nthat kind, since the latter has for its object only the qualified Brahman and\npra _n_ a and the like. For devout meditations on the qualified Brahman may,\nlike acts, be either identical or different. Scripture moreover teaches that,\nlike acts, they have various results; some of them have visible results,\nothers unseen results, and others again--as conducive to the springing up of\nperfect knowledge--have for their result release by successive steps. With a\nview to those meditations, therefore, we may raise the question whether the\nindividual Vedanta-texts teach different cognitions of Brahman or not.\n\nThe arguments which may here be set forth by the purvapakshin are as follows.\nIn the first place it is known that difference may be proved by names, as e.g.\nin the case of the sacrificial performance called 'light' ( _g_ yotis) 1. And\nthe cognitions of Brahman which are enjoined in the different Vedanta-texts\nare connected with different names such as the Taittiriyaka, the Va _g_\nasaneyaka, the Kauthumaka, the Kaushitaka, the _S_ a _t_ yayanaka, &c.--In the\nsecond place the separateness of actions is proved by the difference of form\n(characteristics; rupa). So e.g. with reference to the passage, 'the milk is\nfor the Vi _s_ vedevas, the water for the va _g_ ins.'  2\n\np. 186\n\nNow similar differences of form are met with in the Vedanta-texts; the\nfollowers of one _S_ akha, e.g. mention, in the chapter called 'the knowledge\nof the five fires,' a sixth fire, while other _S_ akhas mention five only; and\nin the colloquy of the pra _n_ as some texts mention a lesser, others a\ngreater number of organs and powers of the body.--In the third place\ndifferences in qualifying particulars (dharma) are supposed to prove\ndifference of acts, and such differences also are met with in the Vedanta-\ntexts; only in the Mu _n_ _d_ aka-Upanishad. e.g. it is said that the science\nof Brahman must be imparted to those only who have performed the rite of\ncarrying fire on the head (Mu. Up. III, 2, 10).--In the same way the other\nreasons which are admitted to prove the separateness of actions, such as\nrepetition and so on, are to be applied in a suitable manner to the different\nVedanta-texts also.--We therefore maintain that each separate Vedanta-text\nteaches a different cognition of Brahman.\n\nTo this argumentation of the purvapakshin we make the following reply.--The\ncognitions enjoined by all the Vedanta-texts are the same, owing to the non-\ndifference of injunction and so on. The 'and so on' refers to the other\nreasons proving non-difference of acts which are enumerated in the Siddhanta-\nsutra of the adhikara _n_ a treating of the different _S_ akhas (Pu. Mi. II,\n4, 9, '(the act) is one on account of the non-difference of connexion of form,\nof injunction, and of name'). Thus, as the agnihotra though described in\ndifferent _S_ akhas is yet one, the same kind of human activity being enjoined\nin all by means of the words, 'He is to offer;' so the injunction met with in\nthe text of the Va _g_ asaneyins (B _ri_. Up. VI, 1, 1), 'He who knows the\noldest and the best,' &c., is the same as that which occurs in the text of the\n_Kh_ andogas, 'He who knows the first and the best' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 1, 1). The\nconnexion of the meditation enjoined with its aim is likewise the same in both\ntexts, 'He becomes the first and best among his people.' In both texts again\nthe cognition enjoined has the same form. For in both the object of knowledge\nis the true nature of the pra _n_ a which is characterised by\n\np. 187\n\ncertain qualities such as being the first and best, and just as the material\nand the divinity constitute the form of the sacrifice, so the object known\nconstitutes the form of the cognition. And finally both cognitions have the\nsame name, viz. the knowledge of the pra _n_ a.--For these reasons we declare\nthat the different Vedanta-texts enjoin identical cognitions.--A similar line\nof reasoning applies to other cognitions which are met with in more than one\nVedanta-text, so e.g. to the knowledge of the five fires, the knowledge of Vai\n_s_ vanara, the knowledge of Sa _n_ _d_ ilya. and so on.--Of the apparent\nreasons on the ground of which the purvapakshin above tried to show that the\nmeditations are not identical but separate a refutation is to be found in the\nPurva Mima _m_ sa-sutras II, 4, 10 ff.\n\nThe next Sutra disposes of a doubt which may remain even after the preceding\ndiscussion.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[185:1](sbe38144.htm#fr_123) See the sa _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ak _ri_\ntakarmabhedadhikara _n_ a, Pu. Mi. Su. II, 2, 22, where the decision is that\nthe word _g_ yotis (in 'athaisha _g_ yotir' &c.) denotes not the _g_ yotish\n_t_ oma but a separate sacrificial performance.\n\n[185:2](sbe38144.htm#fr_124) See Pu. Mi. Su. II, 2, 23. The offering of water\nmade to the divinities called va _g_ in is separate from the offering of milk\nto the Vi _s_ vedevas; for the material offered as well as the divinity to\nwhich the offering is made (i.e. the two rupa of the sacrifice) differs in the\ntwo cases.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 2](sbe38145.htm)\n\n"
