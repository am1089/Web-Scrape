And on account of the greater strength of direct statement, and so on,\nthere is no refutation.\n\nThe weaker means of proof, constituted by so-called leading subject-matter,\ncannot refute what is established by three stronger means of proof--direct\nstatement, inferential mark, and syntactical connexion--viz. that there is an\nindependent purely mental performance, and that the altars made of mind are\nparts of the latter. The direct statement is contained in the following\npassage, 'Those fire-altars indeed are built of knowledge,'--which is further\nexplained in the subsequent passage, 'by knowledge alone these altars are\nbuilt for him who knows this'--the sense of which is: the structures of mind,\nand so on, are built in connexion with a performance which consists of\nknowledge (i.e. meditation).--The inferential mark is contained in the\npassage, 'For him all beings at all times build them, even while he is\nasleep.' And the syntactical connexion (vakya) consists in the connexion of\nthe two words eva _m_ vide\n\np. 671\n\n[paragraph continues] (for him who knows this), and _k_ invanti (they\nbuild)--the sense being: for him who accomplishes the performance consisting\nof knowledge all beings at all times build those altars. The proving power of\nthe passage above referred to as containing an indicatory mark (linga) lies\ntherein that a construction mentally performed at all times by all beings\ncannot possibly connect itself with a sacrificial performance through the\nbrick-altar, which is constructed by certain definite agents and on certain\ndefinite occasions only, and must therefore be an element in a mental\nperformance, i.e. a meditation.--The next Sutra disposes of the objection that\nthe text cannot possibly mean to enjoin a new mental performance, apart from\nthe actual performance, because it contains no word of injunctive force and\ndoes not mention a special result.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 48.
