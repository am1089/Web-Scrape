[2](ry394.htm#fn_896)  \nThe very fire would ne'er consent  \nTo harm a queen so excellent,--  \nThe high-souled Rama's faithful wife,  \nProtected by her holy life.  \nShe lives, she lives. Why should I fear  \nFor one whom Raghu's sons hold dear?  \nHas not the pitying fire that spared  \nThe Vanar for the lady cared?'  \n   Such were his thoughts: he pondered long,  \nAnd fear grew faint and hope grew strong.  \nThen round him heavenly voices rang,  \nAnd, sweetly tuned, his praises sang:  \n'O glorious is the exploit done  \nBy Hanuman the Wind-God's son.  \nThe flames o'er Lanka's city rise:  \nThe giants' home in ruin lies.  \nO'er roof and wall the fires have spread,  \nNor harmed a hair of Sita's head.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LVI: Mount Arishta.](ry394.htm)\n\n"
