Then anew  \nThe arrows from his bowstring flew,  \nAnd pierced, well aimed with perfect art,  \nEach limb and joint and vital part.  \nTransfixed with shafts in every limb.  \nTheir strength relaxed, their eyes grew dim.  \nAs two tall standards side by side,  \nWith each sustaining rope untied.  \nFall levelled by the howling blast,  \nSo earth's majestic lords at last  \nBeneath the arrowy tempest reeled,  \nAnd prostrate pressed the battle field.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[460:1b](ry443.htm#fr_962) Yajnas'atru, Mahaphrava, Mahodar, Vajradanshtra,\nS'uka, and Saran.\n\n[460:2b](ry443.htm#fr_963) Angad.\n\n[460:3b](ry443.htm#fr_964) A mysterious weapon consisting of serpents\ntransformed to arrows which deprived the wounded object of all sense and power\nof motion.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLVI.: Indrajit's Triumph.](ry445.htm)\n\n"
