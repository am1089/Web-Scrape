If it be said that knowledge and mind (which are mentioned) between\n(breath and the elements) (are stated) in order of succession, owing to an\ninferential mark of this; we say, not so, on account of non-difference.\n\n'Knowledge' in the Sutra denotes the means of knowledge, i.e. the sense-\norgans.--An objection is raised against the conclusion arrived at under the\npreceding Sutra. We cannot, the opponent says, admit the conclusion that the\npassage from the Mu _nd_ ka Up. 'from him is born breath, mind,' &c., declares\nthe immediate origination from Brahman of all things, and that hence the\npassage confirms the view, first suggested by the inferential mark of\n'thought' (see above, Su. 14), that everything springs from Brahman direct.\nFor the purport of the text is to state a certain order of succession, and we\nhence conclude that all the beings mentioned were successively created. In the\nsecond half of the text we recognise the series of ether, air, fire, &c.,\nwhich is known to us from other texts, and from the fact of their being\nexhibited in one and the same text we conclude that knowledge and mind--which\nare mentioned between breath on the one side and the elements on the\n\np. 539\n\nother--must be viewed as created in that order. The text therefore in no way\nconfirms the direct origination of everything from Brahman. To this the Sutra\nreplies, 'Not so, on account of non-difference.' The first words of the text\n'from him is born' connect themselves equally with breath, and knowledge, and\nmind, and the scries of elements beginning with ether; and the meaning of the\nwhole therefore is to declare that all the entities spring directly from\nBrahman, not to teach the order of succession in which they are produced. It\nmoreover cannot have the purport of teaching a certain order of succession,\nbecause the order stated contradicts the order established by other scriptural\npassages; such as the one beginning 'the earth is merged in water,' and ending\n'darkness becomes one.' We hence hold to the conclusion that all effects\noriginate from Brahman only, in so far as embodied in the Unevolved, and so\non, and that the terms 'fire' and so on denote Brahman, which is the Self of\nall those substances.--But to interpret all these words as denoting Brahman is\nto set aside their special denotative power as established by etymology!--To\nthis objection the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 17.
