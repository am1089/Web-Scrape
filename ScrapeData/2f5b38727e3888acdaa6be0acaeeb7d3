Pratardana, forsooth, the son of Divodasa (king of Ka _s_ i), came by\nmeans of fighting and strength to the beloved abode of Indra. Indra said to\nhim 'Pratardana, let me give you a boon to choose.' And Pratardana answered:\n'Do you yourself choose that boon for me which you deem most beneficial for a\nman.' Indra said to him: 'No one who chooses, chooses for another; choose\nthyself,' Then Pratardana replied: 'Then that boon to choose is no boon for\nme.'\n\nThen, however, Indra did not swerve from the truth, for Indra is truth. Indra\nsaid to him: 'Know me only; that is what I deem most beneficial for man, that\nhe should know me. I slew the three-headed son of Tvash _t_ _ri_ ; I delivered\nthe Arunmukhas, the devotees, to the wolves (salav _ri_ ka); breaking many\ntreaties, I killed the people of Prahlada in heaven, the people of Puloma in\nthe sky, the people of Kalaka\xc3\xb1 _g_ a on earth 2. And not one hair of me was\nharmed there. And he who knows me thus, by no deed of his is his life harmed,\nnot by the murder of\n\np. 294\n\nhis mother, not by the murder of his father, not by theft, not by the killing\nof a Brahman. If he is going to commit a sin, the bloom 1 does not depart from\nhis face.'\n\n2\\. Indra said: 'I am pra _n_ a, meditate on me as the conscious self (pra _g_\n\xc3\xb1atman), as life, as immortality. Life is pra _n_ a, pra _n_ a is life.\nImmortality is pra _n_ a, pra _n_ a is immortality. As long as pra _n_ a\ndwells in this body, so long surely there is life. By pra _n_ a he obtains\nimmortality in the other world, by knowledge true conception. He who meditates\non me as life and immortality, gains his full life in this world, and obtains\nin the Svarga world immortality and indestructibility.'\n\n(Pratardana said): 'Some maintain here, that the pra _n_ as become one, for\n(otherwise) no one could at the same time make known a name by speech, see a\nform with the eye, hear a sound with the car, think a thought with the mind.\nAfter having become one, the pra _n_ as perceive all these together, one by\none. While speech speaks, all pra _n_ as speak after it. While the eye sees,\nall pra _n_ as see after it. While the car hears, all pra _n_ as hear after\nit. While the mind thinks, all pra _n_ as think after it. While the pra _n_ a\nbreathes, all pra _n_ as breathe after it.'\n\n'Thus it is indeed,' said Indra, 'but nevertheless there is a pre-eminence\namong the pra _n_ as 2.\n\n3\\. Man lives deprived of speech, for we see dumb people. Man lives deprived\nof sight, for we see\n\np. 295\n\nblind people. Man lives deprived of hearing, for we see deaf people. Man lives\ndeprived of mind, for we see infants. Man lives deprived of his arms, deprived\nof his legs, for we see it thus. But pra _n_ a alone is the conscious self\n(pra _g_ \xc3\xb1atman), and having laid hold of this body, it makes it rise up.\nTherefore it is said, Let man worship it alone as uktha 1. What is pra _n_ a,\nthat is pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a (self-consciousness); what is pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a (self-\nconsciousness), that is pra _n_ a, for together they (pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a and pra _n_\na) live in this body, and together they go out of it. Of that, this is the\nevidence, this is the understanding. When a man, being thus asleep, sees no\ndream whatever, he becomes one with that pra _n_ a alone 2. Then speech goes\nto him (when he is absorbed in pra _n_ a) with all names, the eye with all\nforms, the ear with all sounds, the mind with all thoughts. And when he\nawakes, then, as from a burning fire sparks proceed in all directions, thus\nfrom that self the pra _n_ as (speech, &c.) proceed, each towards its place;\nfrom the pra _n_ as the gods (Agni, &c.), from the gods the worlds.\n\nOf this, this is the proof, this is the understanding. When a man is thus\nsick, going to die, falling into weakness and faintness, they say: 'His\nthought has departed, he hears not, he sees not, he speaks not, he thinks\nnot.' Then he becomes one with that pra _n_ a alone. Then speech goes to him\n(who is absorbed in pra _n_ a) with all names, the eye with all\n\np. 296\n\nforms, the ear with all sounds, the mind with all thoughts. And when he\ndeparts from this body, he departs together with all these 1.\n\n4\\. Speech gives up to him (who is absorbed in pra _n_ a) all names, so that\nby speech he obtains all names. The nose gives up to him all odours, so that\nby scent he obtains all odours. The eye gives up to him all forms, so that by\nthe eye he obtains all forms. The ear gives up to him all sounds, so that by\nthe ear he obtains all sounds. The mind gives up to him all thoughts, so that\nby the mind he obtains all thoughts. This is the complete absorption in pra\n_n_ a. And what is pra _n_ a is pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a (self-consciousness), what is pra\n_g_ \xc3\xb1a (self-consciousness) is pra _n_ a. For together do these two live in\nthe body, and together do they depart.\n\nNow we shall explain how all things become one in that pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a (self-\nconsciousness).\n\n5\\. Speech is one portion taken out 2 of pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a (self-conscious\nknowledge), the word is its object, placed outside. The nose is one portion\ntaken out of it, the odour is its object, placed outside. The eye is one\nportion taken out of it, the form is its object, placed outside. The ear is\none portion taken out of it, the sound is its object, placed outside. The\ntongue is one portion taken out of it, the taste of food is its object, placed\noutside. The two hands\n\np. 297\n\nare one portion taken out of it, their action is their object, placed outside.\nThe body is one portion taken out of it, its pleasure and pain are its object,\nplaced outside. The organ is one portion taken out of it, happiness, joy, and\noffspring are its object, placed outside. The two feet are one portion taken\nout of it, movements are their object, placed outside. Mind is one portion\ntaken out of it, thoughts and desires are its object, placed outside.\n\n6\\. Having by pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a (self-conscious knowledge) taken possession of\nspeech, he obtains by speech all words. Having by pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a taken possession\nof the nose, he obtains all odours. Having by pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a taken possession of\nthe eye, he obtains all forms. Having by pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a taken possession of the\near, he obtains all sounds. Having by pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a taken possession of the\ntongue, he obtains all tastes of food. Having by pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a taken possession\nof the two hands, he obtains all actions. Having by pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a taken\npossession of the body, he obtains pleasure and pain. Having by pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a\ntaken possession of the organ, he obtains happiness, joy, and offspring.\nHaving by pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a taken possession of the two feet, he obtains all\nmovements. Having by pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a taken possession of mind, he obtains all\nthoughts.\n\n7\\. For without pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a (self-consciousness) speech does not make known (to\nthe self) any word 1. 'My\n\np. 298\n\nmind was absent,' he says, 'I did not perceive that word.' Without pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a\nthe nose does not make known any odour. 'My mind was absent,' he says, 'I did\nnot perceive that odour.' Without pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a the eye does not make known any\nform. 'My mind was absent,' he says, 'I did not perceive that form.' Without\npra _g_ \xc3\xb1a the ear does not make known any sound. 'My mind was absent,' he\nsays, 'I did not perceive that sound.' Without pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a the tongue does not\nmake known any taste. 'My mind was absent,' he says, 'I did not perceive that\ntaste.' Without pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a the two hands do not make known any act. 'Our mind\nwas absent,' they say, 'we did not perceive any act.' Without pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a the\nbody does not make known pleasure or pain. 'My mind was absent,' he says, 'I\ndid not perceive that pleasure or pain.' Without pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a the organ does not\nmake known happiness, joy, or offspring. 'My mind was absent,' he says, 'I did\nnot perceive that happiness, joy, or offspring.' Without pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a, the two\nfeet do not make known any movement. 'Our mind was absent,' they say, 'we did\nnot perceive that movement.' Without pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a no thought succeeds, nothing\ncan be known that is to be known.\n\n8\\. Let no man try to find out what speech is, let him know the speaker. Let\nno man try to find out what odour is, let him know him who smells. Let no man\ntry to find out what form is, let him know the seer. Let no man try to find\nout what sound is, let\n\np. 299\n\nhim know the hearer. Let no man try to find out the tastes of food, let him\nknow the knower of tastes. Let no man try to find out what action is, let him\nknow the agent. Let no man try to find out what pleasure and pain are, let him\nknow the knower of pleasure and pain. Let no man try to find out what\nhappiness, joy, and offspring are, let him know the knower of happiness, joy,\nand offspring. Let no man try to find out what movement is, let him know the\nmover. Let no man try to find out what mind is, let him know the thinker.\nThese ten objects (what is spoken, smelled, seen, &c.) have reference to pra\n_g_ \xc3\xb1a (self-consciousness), the ten subjects (speech, the senses, mind) have\nreference to objects. If there were no objects, there would be no subjects;\nand if there were no subjects, there would be no objects. For on either side\nalone nothing could be achieved. But that (the self of pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a,\nconsciousness, and pra _n_ a, life) is not many, (but one.) For as in a car\nthe circumference of a wheel is placed on the spokes, and the spokes on the\nnave, thus are these objects (circumference) placed on the subjects (spokes),\nand the subjects on the pra _n_ a. And that pra _n_ a (breath, the living and\nbreathing power) indeed is the self of pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a (the self-conscious self),\nblessed, imperishable, immortal. He does not increase by a good action, nor\ndecrease by a bad action. For he (the self of pra _n_ a and pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a) makes\nhim, whom he wishes to lead up from these worlds, do a good deed; and the same\nmakes him, whom he wishes to lead down from these worlds, do a bad deed 1. And\nhe is the guardian of the world, he is\n\np. 300\n\nthe king of the world, he is the lord of the universe,--and he is my (Indra's)\nself, thus let it be known, yea, thus let it be known!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[293:1](sbe01241.htm#fr_745) The object now is to explain the true Brahma-\nvidya, while the first and second chapters are only introductory, treating of\nthe worship of the couch (parya\xe1\xb9\x85kopasana) and of the worship of pra _n_ a.\n\n[293:2](sbe01241.htm#fr_746) This refers to heroic deeds performed by Indra,\nas represented in the hymns of the Rig-veda. See Rig-veda V, 34, 4, and Saya\n_n_ a's commentary; Ait. Brahm. VII, 28. Weber, Indische Studien I, 410-418,\nhas tried to discover an original physical meaning in the heroic deeds\nascribed to Indra. A curious remark is made by the commentator, who says that\nthe skulls of the Arunmukhas were turned into the thorns of the desert\n(karira) which remain to this day,--a very common phase in popular tradition.\n\n[294:1](sbe01241.htm#fr_747) Professor Cowell compares Taittiriya-Sa _m_ hita\nIII, 1, 1, nasya nita _m_ na haro vyeti.\n\n[294:2](sbe01241.htm#fr_748) Pra _n_ as, in the plural, is supposed to stand\nfor the five senses as modifications of breath. It would be better if we could\nread pra _n_ asya ni _h_ _s_ reyasam. See before, II, 14.\n\n[295:1](sbe01241.htm#fr_749) Uktha, hymn, is artificially derived from ut-\nthapayati, to raise up, and hence uktha, hymn, is to be meditated on as pra\n_n_ a, breath, which likewise raises up the body. See Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 1, 15.\n\n[295:2](sbe01241.htm#fr_750) He is absorbed in pra _n_ a. Or should it be pra\n_n_ a _h_ as nominative?\n\n[296:1](sbe01241.htm#fr_751) According to another reading we might translate,\n'Speech takes away all names from that body; and pra _n_ a, in which speech is\nabsorbed, thus obtains all names.'\n\n[296:2](sbe01241.htm#fr_752) I read udu _lh_ am or udu _dh_ am, instead of adu\n_dh_ am, explained by the commentator as aduduhat. Professor Cowell\ntranslates, 'Speech verily milked one portion thereof,' which may have been\nthe original purport of the writer.\n\n[297:1](sbe01241.htm#fr_753) Professor Cowell has translated a passage from\nthe commentary which is interesting as showing that its author and the author\nof the Upanishad too had a clear conception of the correlative nature of\nknowledge. 'The organ of sense,' he says, 'cannot exist without pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a\n(self-consciousness), nor the objects of sense be obtained without the organ,\ntherefore--on the principle, that when one thing cannot exist without another,\nthat thing is said to be identical with the other--as the cloth, for instance,\nbeing p. 298 never perceived without the threads, is identical with them, or\nthe (false perception of) silver being never found without the mother of pearl\nis identical with it, so the objects of sense being never found without the\norgans are identical with them, and the organs being never found without pra\n_g_ \xc3\xb1a (self-consciousness) are identical with it.\n\n[299:1](sbe01241.htm#fr_754) The other text says, 'whom he wishes to draw\nafter him; and whom he wishes to draw away from these worlds.' Ramatirtha, in\np. 300 his commentary on the Mait. Up. 3, 2, quotes the text as translated\nabove.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Adhyaya IV](sbe01242.htm)\n\n"
