And as in the analogous case of stones and the like, there is\nimpossibility of that.\n\nIn the same way as it is impossible that the different non-sentient things\nsuch as stones, iron, wood, herbs, &c., which are of an extremely low\nconstitution and subject to constant change, should be one in nature with\nBrahman, which is faultless, changeless, fundamentally antagonistic to all\nthat is evil, &c. &c.; so it is also impossible that the individual soul,\nwhich is liable to endless suffering, and a mere wretched glowworm as it were,\nshould be one with Brahman who, as we know from the texts, comprises within\nhimself the treasure of all auspicious qualities, &c. &c. Those texts, which\nexhibit Brahman and the soul in coordination, must be understood as conveying\nthe doctrine, founded on passages such as 'of whom the Self is the body,' that\nas the _g_ iva constitutes Brahman's body and Brahman abides within the _g_\niva as its Self, Brahman has the _g_ iva for its mode; and with this doctrine\nthe co-ordination referred to is not only not in conflict but even confirms it\n--as we have shown repeatedly, e.g. under Su. I, 4, 22. Brahman\n\np. 470\n\nin all its states has the souls and matter for its body; when the souls and\nmatter are in their subtle state Brahman is in its causal condition; when, on\nthe other hand, Brahman has for its body souls and matter in their gross\nstate, it is 'effected' and then called world. In this way the co-ordination\nabove referred to fully explains itself. The world is non-different from\nBrahman in so far as it is its effect. There is no confusion of the different\ncharacteristic qualities; for liability to change belongs to non-sentient\nmatter, liability to pain to sentient souls, and the possession of all\nexcellent qualities to Brahman: hence the doctrine is not in conflict with any\nscriptural text. That even in the state of non-separation-described in texts\nsuch as, 'Being only this was in the beginning'--the souls joined to non-\nsentient matter persist in a subtle condition and thus constitute Brahman's\nbody must necessarily be admitted; for that the souls at that time also\npersist in a subtle form is shown under Sutras II, I, 34; 35. Non-division, at\nthat time, is possible in so far as there is no distinction of names and\nforms. It follows from all this that Brahman's causality is not contrary to\nreason.\n\nThose, on the other hand, who explain the difference, referred to in Sutra 22,\nas the difference between the _g_ iva in its state of bondage and the _g_ iva\nin so far as free from avidya, i.e. the unconditioned Brahman, implicate\nthemselves in contradictions. For the _g_ iva., in so far as free from avidya,\nis neither all-knowing, nor the Lord of all, nor the cause of all, nor the\nSelf of all, nor the ruler of all--it in fact possesses none of those\ncharacteristics on which the scriptural texts found the difference of the\nreleased soul; for according to the view in question all those attributes are\nthe mere figment of Nescience. Nor again can the Sutra under discussion be\nsaid to refer to the distinction, from the individual soul, of a Lord\nfictitiously created by avidya\\--a distinction analogous to that which a man\nin the state of avidya makes between the shell and the silver; for it is the\ntask of the Vedanta to convey a knowledge of that true Brahman which is\nintroduced as the object of enquiry in the first Sutra ('Now then the enquiry\ninto Brahman')\n\np. 471\n\nand which is the cause of the origination and so on of the world, and what\nthey at this point are engaged in is to refute the objections raised against\nthe doctrine of that Brahman on the basis of Sm _ri_ ti and Reasoning.--The\ntwo Sutras II, 1, 8; 9 really form a complementary statement to what is proved\nin the present adhikara _n_ a; for their purport is to show also that things\nof different nature can stand to each other in the relation of cause and\neffect. And the Sutra II, 1, 7 has reference to what is contained in the\nprevious adhikara _n_ a.\n\nHere terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'designation of the other.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 24. ... as in the case of milk](sbe48193.htm)\n\n"
