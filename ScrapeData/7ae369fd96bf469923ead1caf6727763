So is that well said:  \n"By works the votary doth rise to faith,  \nAnd saintship is the ceasing from all works;  \nBecause the perfect Yogin acts- but acts  \nUnmoved by passions and unbound by deeds,  \nSetting result aside.  \nLet each man raise  \nThe Self by Soul, not trample down his Self,  \nSince Soul that is Self\'s friend may grow Self\'s foe.  \nSoul is Self\'s friend when Self doth rule o\'er Self,  \nBut Self turns enemy if Soul\'s own self  \nHates Self as not itself.  \nThe sovereign soul  \nOf him who lives self-governed and at peace  \nIs centred in itself, taking alike  \nPleasure and pain; heat, cold; glory and shame.  \nHe is the Yogi, he is Yukta, glad  \nWith joy of light and truth; dwelling apart  \nUpon a peak, with senses subjugate  \nWhereto the clod, the rock, the glistering gold  \nShow all as one. By this sign is he known  \nBeing of equal grace to comrades, friends,  \nChance-comers, strangers, lovers, enemies,  \nAliens and kinsmen; loving all alike,  \nEvil or good.\n\nSequestered should he sit,  \nSteadfastly meditating, solitary,  \nHis thoughts controlled, his passions laid away,  \nQuit of belongings. In a fair, still spot  \nHaving his fixed abode,- not too much raised,  \nNor yet too low,- let him abide, his goods  \nA cloth, a deerskin, and the Kusa-grass.  \nThere, setting hard his mind upon The One,  \nRestraining heart and senses, silent, calm,  \nLet him accomplish Yoga, and achieve  \nPureness of soul, holding immovable  \nBody and neck and head, his gaze absorbed  \nUpon his nose-end, rapt from all around,  \nTranquil in spirit, free of fear, intent  \nUpon his Brahmacharya vow, devout,  \nMusing on Me, lost in the thought of Me.  \nThat Yogin, so devoted, so controlled,  \nComes to the peace beyond,- My peace, the peace  \nOf high Nirvana!\n\nBut for earthly needs  \nReligion is not his who too much fasts  \nOr too much feasts, nor his who sleeps away  \nAn idle mind; nor his who wears to waste  \nHis strength in vigils. Nay, Arjuna! I call  \nThat the true piety which most removes  \nEarth-aches and ills, where one is moderate  \nIn eating and in resting, and in sport;  \nMeasured in wish and act; sleeping betimes,  \nWaking betimes for duty.\n\nWhen the man,  \nSo living, centres on his soul the thought  \nStraitly restrained- untouched internally  \nBy stress of sense- then is he Yukta. See!  \nSteadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind;  \nSuch is the likeness of the Yogi\'s mind  \nShut from sense-storms and burning bright to Heaven.  \nWhen mind broods placid, soothed with holy wont;  \nWhen Self contemplates self, and in itself  \nHath comfort; when it knows the nameless joy  \nBeyond all scope of sense, revealed to soul-  \nOnly to soul! and, knowing, wavers not,  \nTrue to the farther Truth; when, holding this,  \nIt deems no other treasure comparable,  \nBut, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook  \nBy any gravest grief, call that state "peace,"  \nThat happy severance Yoga; call that man  \nThe perfect Yogin!\n\nSteadfastly the will  \nMust toil thereto, till efforts end in ease,  \nAnd thought has passed from thinking. Shaking off  \nAll longings bred by dreams of fame and gain,  \nShutting the doorways of the senses close  \nWith watchful ward; so, step by step, it comes  \nTo gift of peace assured and heart assuaged,  \nWhen the mind dwells self-wrapped, and the soul broods  \nCumberless. But, as often as the heart  \nBreaks- wild and wavering- from control, so oft  \nLet him re-curb it, let him rein it back  \nTo the soul\'s governance; for perfect bliss  \nGrows only in the bosom tranquillised,  \nThe spirit passionless, purged from offence,  \nVowed to the Infinite. He who thus vows  \nHis soul to the Supreme Soul, quitting sin,  \nPasses unhindered to the endless bliss  \nOf unity with Brahma. He so vowed,  \nSo blended, sees the Life-Soul resident  \nIn all things living, and all living things  \nIn that Life-Soul contained. And whoso thus  \nDiscerneth Me in all, and all in Me,  \nI never let him go; nor looseneth he  \nHold upon Me; but, dwell he where he may,  \nWhate\'er his life, in Me he dwells and lives,  \nBecause he knows and worships Me, Who dwell  \nIn all which lives, and cleaves to Me in all.  \nArjuna! if a man sees everywhere-  \nTaught by his own similitude- one Life,  \nOne Essence in the Evil and the Good,  \nHold him a Yogi, yea! well perfected!  \nArjuna. Slayer of Madhu! yet again, this Yog,  \nThis Peace, derived from equanimity,  \nMade known by thee- I see no fixity  \nTherein, no rest, because the heart of men  \nIs unfixed, Krishna! rash, tumultuous,  \nWilful and strong. It were all one, I think,  \nTo hold the wayward wind, as tame man\'s heart.  \nKrishna. Hero long-armed! beyond denial, hard  \nMan\'s heart is to restrain, and wavering;  \nYet may it grow restrained by habit, Prince!  \nBy wont of self-command. This Yog, I say,  \nCometh not lightly to th\' ungoverned ones;  \nBut he who will be master of himself  \nShall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto.  \nArjuna. And what road goeth he who, having faith,  \nFails, Krishna! in the striving; falling back  \nFrom holiness, missing the perfect rule?  \nIs he not lost, straying from Brahma\'s light,  \nLike the vain cloud, which floats \'twixt earth and heaven  \nWhen lightning splits it, and it vanisheth?  \nFain would I hear thee answer me herein,  \nSince, Krishna! none save thou can clear the doubt.  \nKrishna. He is not lost, thou Son of Pritha! No!  \nNor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him,  \nBecause no heart that holds one right desire  \nTreadeth the road of loss! He who should fail,  \nDesiring righteousness, cometh at death  \nUnto the Region of the Just; dwells there  \nMeasureless years, and being born anew,  \nBeginneth life again in some fair home  \nAmid the mild and happy. It may chance  \nHe doth descend into a Yogin house  \nOn Virtue\'s breast; but that is rare! Such birth  \nIs hard to be obtained on this earth, Chief!  \nSo hath he back again what heights of heart  \nHe did achieve, and so he strives anew  \nTo perfectness, with better hope, dear Prince!  \nFor by the old desire he is drawn on  \nUnwittingly; and only to desire  \nThe purity of Yog is to pass  \nBeyond the Sabdabrahm, the spoken Ved.  \nBut, being Yogi, striving strong and long,  \nPurged from transgressions, perfected by births  \nFollowing on births, he plants his feet at last  \nUpon the farther path. Such as one ranks  \nAbove ascetics, higher than the wise,  \nBeyond achievers of vast deeds! Be thou  \nYogi Arjuna! And of such believe,  \nTruest and best is he who worships Me  \nWith inmost soul, stayed on My Mystery!\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER VI OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Atmasanyamayog,"  \nOr "The Book of Religion of Self-Restraint."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7: Of Religion by Discernment](bg07.htm)\n\n'
