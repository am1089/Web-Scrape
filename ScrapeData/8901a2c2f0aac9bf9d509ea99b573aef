(He says), \'Memory and reproach and knowledge, faith, and wisdom as the\nfifth, what is sacrificed, and what is given, and what is studied, and what is\ndone, truth, learning, vow\xc2\x97\n\n\'The vow which belongs to Agni together with Indra, with Pra _g_ apati, with\nthe _Ri_ shis, with the royal ones among the _Ri_ shis, with the Fathers, with\nthe royal ones among the Fathers, with the human beings, with the royal ones\namong the human beings, with shine, over-shine, after-shine, counter-shine,\nwith gods and men, with Gandharvas and Apsaras, with wild animals and domestic\nanimals,\xc2\x97the vow, belonging to my own self, dwelling in my own self, that is\nmy universal vow. Hereby, O Agni, I become addicted to the universal vow.\nSvaha!\'\n\n2 2. With (the hymn), \'Mine, Agni, be vigour\' (Rig-veda X, 128, 1), verse by\nverse, he should put pieces of wood (on the fire).\n\n3 3. He should pass that night at a place where they will do honour to him.\n\np. 230\n\n4 4. When, after having finished his (task of) learning, he has offered\nsomething to the teacher, or has received his permission, he should take a\nbath (which signifies the end of his studentship).\n\n5\\. He (i.e. the Snataka) has to keep the following observances:\n\n6\\. He shall not bathe in the night-time; he shall not bathe naked; he shall\nnot lie down naked; he shall not look at a naked woman, except during sexual\nintercourse; he shall not run during rain; he shall not climb up a tree; he\nshall not descend into a well; he shall not swim with his arms across a river;\nhe shall not expose himself to danger. \'A great being indeed is a\nSnataka\'\xc2\x97thus it is understood (in the _S_ ruti).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[229:1](sbe29142.htm#fr_555) 9, 1. \'"My memory and my non-memory, that is my\ndouble vow"\xc2\x97in this way the twelve (parts of which the first section of the\nMantra consists) should be recited.\' Naraya _n_ a. I think the commentator is\nwrong here, and that section should rather be recited as it is given in the\ntext without any alteration; it forms a regular _S_ loka. Agne _h_ instead of\nAgne is a conjecture of Prof. Stenzler, which I have adopted.\n\n[229:2](sbe29142.htm#fr_556) According to Naraya _n_ a the hymn should be\nrecited including the Khila, so that ten pieces of wood are offered. Now the\nhymn consists of nine verses; there can be, consequently, only one Khailika\nverse, which is, I suppose, the first verse of the Khila quoted above, p. 228.\n\n[229:3](sbe29142.htm#fr_557) By a Madhuparka (Naraya _n_ a).
