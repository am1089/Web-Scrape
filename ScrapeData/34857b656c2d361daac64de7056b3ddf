But there is no origin of that which is (i.e. of Brahman), on account of\nthe impossibility (of such an origin).\n\nSomebody, who has learned from scripture that ether and air, although not in\nthemselves likely to have originated, yet actually are things with a\nbeginning, might feel inclined to suspect that Brahman itself has sprung from\nsomething else. And further somebody, who has learned from scripture that from\nether and the other elements which are themselves mere effects further effects\nare produced, might think that also Brahman, from which ether has sprung, is a\nmere effect.\n\nIn order to remove this doubt the Sutra declares that Brahman, whose Self is\nBeing, must not be suspected to have sprung from anything else 'on account of\nthe impossibility.' Brahman which is mere Being cannot spring from mere\n\np. 20\n\nbeing, since the relation of cause and effect cannot exist without a certain\nsuperiority (on the part of the cause). Nor again can Brahman spring from that\nwhich is something particular, since this would be contrary to experience. For\nwe observe that particular forms of existence are produced from what is\ngeneral, as, for instance, jars and pots from clay, but not that what is\ngeneral is produced from particulars. Nor again can Brahman spring from that\nwhich is not (asat), for that which is not is without a Self 1, and moreover\nscripture expressly rejects that view, in the passage 'How could that which is\nspring from that which is not?' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 2). Another passage,\nmoreover, expressly denies that Brahman has any progenitor, 'He is the cause,\nthe lord of the lords of the organs, and there is of him neither progenitor\nnor lord' ( _S_ ve. Up. VI, 9).--With regard to ether and air the possibility\nof an origin has been shown; but in Brahman's case there is no such\npossibility; hence the cases are not parallel. Nor does the fact of other\neffects springing from effects imply that Brahman also must be an effect; for\nthe non-admission of a fundamental causal substance would drive us to a\nretrogressus in infinitum. And that fundamental causal substance which as a\nmatter of fact is generally acknowledged to exist, just that is our Brahman.--\nThus there is not any contradiction.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[20:1](sbe38010.htm#fr_17) And cannot therefore constitute a cause; for a\ncause is the Self of its effects.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 10](sbe38011.htm)\n\n"
