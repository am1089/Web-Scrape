XXIV.\n\nMuchukunda goes to perform penance. Krishn\xcc\x81a takes the army and treasures of\nKalayavana, and repairs with them to Dwaraka. Balarama visits Vraja: inquiries\nof its inhabitants after Krishn\xcc\x81a.\n\nTHUS praised by the wise Muchukunda, the sovereign of all things, the eternal\nlord, Hari, said to him, "Go to whatever celestial regions you wish, lord of\nmen, possessed of might irresistible, honoured by my favour. When you have\nfully enjoyed all heavenly pleasures, you shall be born in a distinguished\nfamily, retaining the recollection of your former births; and you shall\nfinally obtain emancipation." Having heard this promise, and prostrated\nhimself before Achyuta, the lord of the world, Muchukunda, went forth from the\ncave, and beholding men of diminutive stature, now first knew that the Kali\nage had arrived. The king therefore departed to Gandhamadana, the shrine of\nNaran\xcc\x81arayan\xcc\x81a, to perform penance.\n\nKrishn\xcc\x81a having by this stratagem destroyed his enemy, returned to Mathura,\nand took captive his army, rich in horses, elephants and cars, which he\nconducted to Dwaraka, and delivered to Ugrasena, and the Yadu race was\nrelieved from all fear of invasion. Baladeva, when hostilities had entirely\nceased, being desirous of seeing his kinsmen, went to Nanda\'s cow-pens, and\nthere again conversed with the herdsmen and their females, with affection and\nrespect. By some, the elders, he was embraced; others, the juniors, he\nembraced; and with those of his own age, male or female, he talked and\nlaughed. The cowherds made many kind speeches to Halayudha; but some of the\nGopis spoke to him with the affectation of anger, or with feelings of\njealousy, as they inquired after the loves of Krishn\xcc\x81a with the women of\nMathura. "Is all well with the fickle and inconstant Krishn\xcc\x81a?" said they:\n"Does the volatile swain, the friend of an instant, amuse the women of the\ncity by laughing at our rustic efforts (to please him)? Does he ever think of\nus, singing in chorus to his songs? Will he not come here once again to see\nhis mother? But why talk of these things? it is a different tale to tell for\n\np. 570\n\nhim without us, and for us without him. Father, mother, brother, husband, kin,\nwhat have we not abandoned for his sake? but he is a monument of ingratitude.\nYet tell us, does not Krishn\xcc\x81a talk of coming here? Falsehood is never, O\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, to be uttered by thee. Verily this is Damodara, this is Govinda, who\nhas given up his heart to the damsels of the city, who has no longer any\nregard for us, but looks upon us with disdain." So saying, the Gopis, whose\nminds were fixed on Krishn\xcc\x81a, addressed Rama in his place, calling him\nDamodara and Govinda, and laughed and were merry; and Rama consoled them by\ncommunicating to them agreeable, modest, affectionate, and gentle messages\nfrom Krishn\xcc\x81a. With the cowherds he talked mirthfully, as he had been wont to\ndo, and rambled along with them over the lands of Vraja 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[570:1](vp141.htm#fr_1529) This visit of Balarama to Vraja is placed by the\nHari Van\xc5\x9ba anterior to the fall of Mathura; by the Bhagavata, long subsequent\nto the establishment of the Yadus at Dwaraka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXV](vp142.htm)\n\n'
