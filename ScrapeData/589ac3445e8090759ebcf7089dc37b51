Oblation for the suppression of enemies (nairbadhyam havih).\n\n1\\. Forth from his home do I drive that person yonder, who as a rival contends\nwith us: through the oblation devoted to suppression Indra, has broken him to\npieces.  \n2\\. Indra, the slayer of Vritra, shall drive him to the remotest distance,\nfrom which in all successive years he shall not again return!  \n3\\. He shall go to the three distances, he shall go beyond the five peoples;\nhe shall go beyond the three ethers, whence he shall not again in all\nsuccessive years return, while the sun is upon the heavens!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII 37.
