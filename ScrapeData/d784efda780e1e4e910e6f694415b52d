The participation (on Brahman\'s part) in increase and decrease, due to\nits abiding within (is denied); on account of the appropriateness of both\n(comparisons), and because thus it is seen.\n\nThe comparison of the highest Self to the reflected sun and the rest is meant\nonly to deny of the Self that it participates in the imperfections--such as\nincrease, decrease, and the like--which attach to the earth and the other\nbeings within which the Self abides.--How do we know this?--From the\ncircumstance that on this supposition both comparisons are appropriate. In the\nscriptural text quoted above Brahman is compared to ether, which although one\nbecomes manifold through the things--jars and so on--within it; and to the\nsun, which is multiplied by the sheets of water in which he is reflected. Now\nthe employment of these comparisons--with ether which really does abide within\nthe jars and so on, and with the sun which in reality does not abide in the\nwater--is appropriate only if they are meant to convey the idea that the\nhighest Self does not participate in the imperfections inherent in earth and\nso on. Just as ether, although connecting itself separately with jars, pots,\nand so on, which undergo increase and decrease, is not itself touched by these\nimperfections; and just as the sun, although seen in sheets of water of\nunequal extent, is not touched by their increase and decrease; thus the\nhighest Self, although abiding within variously-shaped beings, whether non-\nsentient like earth or sentient, remains untouched by their various\nimperfections--increase, decrease, and so on--,remains one although abiding in\nall of them, and ever keeps the treasure of its blessed qualities unsullied by\nan atom even of impurity.--The comparison of Brahman with the reflected sun\nholds good on the following account. As the sun is not touched by the\nimperfections belonging to the water, since he does not really abide in the\nwater and hence there is no reason for his sharing those imperfections, thus\nthe highest Self,\n\np. 615\n\nwhich really abides within earth and the rest, is not affected by their\nimperfections; for as the nature of the highest Self is essentially\nantagonistic to all imperfection, there is no reason for its participating in\nthe imperfection of others.--\'And as this is seen.\' This means--Since we\nobserve in ordinary life also that comparisons are instituted between two\nthings for the reason that although they do not possess all attributes in\ncommon, they yet have some attribute in common. We say, e.g. \'this man is like\na lion.\'--The conclusion from all this is that the highest Self, which is\nessentially free from all imperfections and a treasure as it were of all\nblessed qualities, in no way suffers from dwelling within the earth and the\nrest.\n\nAn objection is raised. In the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka, in the chapter\nbeginning \'There are two forms of Brahman, the material and the immaterial,\'\nthe whole material world, gross and subtle, is at first referred to as\nconstituting the form of Brahman, and next a special form of Brahman is\nmentioned: \'And what is the form of that Person? Like a saffron-coloured\nraiment,\' &c. But thereupon the text proceeds, \'Now follows the teaching--not\nso, not so; for there is not anything else higher than this "not so." \'This\npassage, referring to all the previously mentioned forms of Brahman by means\nof the word \'so,\' negatives them; intimating thereby that Brahman is nothing\nelse than pure Being, and that all distinctions are mere imaginations due to\nBrahman not knowing its own essential nature. How then can Brahman possess the\ntwofold characteristics?--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 21.
