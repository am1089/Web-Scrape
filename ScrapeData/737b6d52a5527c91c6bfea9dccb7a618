Vyasa said :-- O King! When the King S'aryati departed, that virtuous\nlady devoted her time in serving her husband, and the Fire. She gave to the\nMuni for his food various delicious roots and fruits. She made him bathe with\nwarm water; then making him put on the deer skin, she made him sit on the\nKus'asan. (Seat made of the Kus'a grass.) Next she used to place in his front\nKus'a, Til and Kamandalu and speak to him \xc2\x93O best of Munis! You are now to\nperform your daily rites (Nitya Karma).\xc2\x94 When the Nitya Karma was finished,\nthe lady used to catch him by his hand and make him sit on another seat. Next\nthe\n\n\n\np. 606\n\n\n\nprincess brought fresh ripe fruits and cooked rice, grown without cultivation\nand gave to the Muni for his food. When the husband finished his meals, she\ngave him devotedly water for cleansing his mouth; then washing his hands and\nfeet gave him the betelnuts and pan leaves. Next she made him sit on an\nexcellent seat, and with his permission, performed her own bodily\npurifications. She then, used to eat the remnants, fruits and roots of the\ndishes of her husband; and coming next to her husband addressed him\naffectionately \xc2\x93O Lord! Order me what can I do now for you? If you like, I may\nshampoo your legs and feet.\xc2\x94 Thus every day that princess devotedly spent her\ntime in serving her husband. At evening when the Homa ceremony was finished,\nshe collecting delicious and soft fruits presented to him to eat. With his\npermission she, then, ate that were left of the fruits; next she prepared\nbedding soft to the touch and gladly made him sleep on it. When his dear\nhusband thus laid himself on the bed, she shampooed his feet and legs and in\nthe interval, asked him about the religious duties of the chaste wives of the\nfamily. When the Muni fell asleep in the night, she devotedly laid herself\nclose to his feet and slept. During the summer season when her husband was\nperspiring, the lady used to fan him with cool breeze. She took off his\ntroubles and thus served her husband. In the cold season, she collected\nfirewood and lit them before him and used to ask him frequently \xc2\x93O Muni! Are\nyou feeling pleasure in this?\xc2\x94 That lady, dear to her husband, used to get up\nfrom her bed in the Brahma Muhurta before Sunrise, next made her husband get\nup and took him some short way off and there made him sit for calling on\nnature. She kept ready water and earth and stood in readiness at a suitable\ndistance apart. Knowing that he had finished his calls for nature, she took\nhim back to the \xc3\x82s'ram, and washed his hands and feet with water duly making\nhim sit on a convenient \xc3\x82sana. She then gave to him the pot for \xc3\x82chamana and\nthen began to collect fuel. She used to bring pure clear water and made it\nhot; then she asked her husband fondly \xc2\x93O Husband! Have you finished cleaning\nyour teeth? Warm water is ready; may I bring it to you? You better bathe with\nthat, uttering your Mantrams. The time is now for performing the morning\nSandhya and for performing Homa. Do the Homa regularly and worship the Devas.\xc2\x94\nThe princess, whose nature was pure and clean as anything, kept herself\nengaged daily in serving her husband, Chyavana Muni, with perfect gladness,\nausterity, and observing all the rules duly. Thus that beautiful-faced\nprincess worshipped gladly Chyavana Muni, serving Fire and the guests daily.\nThen, once, on an occasion, the As'vin twins, the sons of Surya came sporting\nand at their pleasure, close to the hermitage of the Chyavana Muni. At that\n\n\n\np. 607\n\n\n\ntime the princess, beautiful in all respects, was returning home after her\nbath in a pure clear stream and came to the sight of the two As'vins. Being\nenchanted by her extraordinary lovely beauty, they thought she might be a Deva\nKavya, quickly went to her and fondly questioned her :-- \xc2\x93O slow moving One\nlike an elephant! Look! We are the sons of Devas; we have come to you to ask\nsome questions. O Excellent One! Wait for a moment; we request thus to you. O\nSweet-smiling One! Please answer our questions truly and properly. O Lovely-\neyed! Whose daughter are you? Who is your husband Why have you come here alone\nto bathe in this tank? O Lotus-eyed! You seem to be a second Lak _s_ mi; O\nBeautiful One! We want to know something; please reply exactly. O Beloved!\nYour feet are exceedingly gentle; why have you not put on any shoes; why are\nyou walking barefooted? Our hearts are being troubled to see you walking thus\nbarefooted? O Thin bodied One! Your body is very soft that you ought to have\ngone in a car; why are you thus walking on foot and in such an ordinary dress\nin this forest? Why have not hundreds of maid-servants accompanied you? O\nlovely faced One! Speak truly whether you are a princess or Apsara. O Sinless\nOne! Blessed is your mother from whom you are born, blessed is your father.\nSpecially the person with whom you are married, we are unable to describe his\nfortune. O Lovely eyed! This earth is being sanctified by the movements of\nyour feet; consequently this garden is now purer today than the Devaloka.\nBoundless is the fortune of these deer and birds who can see you whenever they\nlike; what more can we say than this that this forest is rendered very pure. O\nFair One with fair eyes! It is needless to praise your beauty; speak truly who\nis your father and who is your husband; we like very much to see them.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39-56. Vyasa said :-- O King! On hearing their words, the exquisitely\nbeautiful princess bespoke to the twin Devas with much bashfulness :-- I am\nthe daughter of S'aryati; father has given me over, under the directions of\nthe Daiva, to the Mahar _s_ i Chyavana. I am his chaste dear wife; the Mahar\n_s_ i is staying in this very place. O Twin Devas! My husband is a blind\nascetic and he is very aged. I gladly serve him day and night according to the\nrules of chastity amongst women. Who are you? And why have you come here? My\nhusband is staying in the \xc3\x82s'rama; kindly come and sanctify the As'rama. O\nKing! The two As'vins heard her and said :-- \xc2\x93O Auspicious One! Why has your\nfather betrothed you, such a gem, to an old ascetic? It is very strange.\nIndeed! In this solitary forest you are shining like a steady lightning; what\nmore can we say than this that we hardly find a beautiful lady like you, even\n\n\n\np. 608\n\n\n\nin the Devaloka! Alas! The Deva dress and a full set of ornaments and blue\ndyes look well on you; this deer-skin and barks of trees in no way fit you. O\nBeautiful One! Your eyes are very large; yet the Creator has given you a blind\nhusband; specially a very aged one; and you are wearing away by constantly\ndwelling with your blind husband in this forest. What more can be wrong for\nthe Creator than this? O deer-eyed One! In vain you have selected him for your\nhusband. At this period of your youth and beauty it does not look at all well\nto see you with your blind husband. You are versed in dancing and music; but\nyour husband is blind and aged; when in dancing you will shoot your darts of\nlove, on whom then, will those arrows fall? O large-eyed One! Oh! The Creator\nis certainly of a very little understanding! Else why would he have made you,\nso full of youthful vitality, the wife of a blind man? O lovely-eyed One! You\nare never fit for him; select another husband. O Lotus-eyed One! Your husband\nis not only blind but an ascetic; so your life is quite useless; we do not\nconsider it fit that you reside in this forest and put on this bark and deer-\nskin. O dark-eyed One! Your body and every limb thereof is very beautiful;\njudge well and make one amongst us your husband. O Proud One! Why are you\nbeing so very beautiful, spending your youth in vain in serving this Muni? No\ngood signs are visible in this Muni; he cannot maintain nor protect you even ;\nwhy are you, then, serving him in vain? O spotless One! Leave at once this\nMuni, quite incapable in giving any sort of pleasure, and marry one of us. O\nBeloved! Then you will enjoy in the Nandana Kanana or in the forest of\nChaitratarha. O Proud One! How will you spend your time with the aged husband,\nbeing brought to so much humiliation and without any dignity and self-respect.\nYou are endowed with all auspicious signs; moreover you are a princess; you\nare not ignorant of all enjoyments in this world; why then you like to live\nsuch an unfortunate life in vain in this forest? O Princess! Your face is\nexceedingly beautiful; your eyes are wide and your waist is thin. Your voice\nis sweet like a cuckoo. Who is more beautiful than you? Quit now your aged\nascetic husband and marry one of us for your happiness; then you will be able\nto enjoy excellent celestial things in the heavens. O good-haired one! What\npleasure can you derive by your staying in this forest with your blind\nhusband! O deer-eyed One. It is very painful for you to serve at this young\nage of yours, to remain in this forest and serve this aged man. O Princess! Is\nit that you like troubles and nothing else. O One with a face lovely like the\nMoon! We see that you are of a very soft body; so to collect water and fruits\nis never a duty fit for you.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourth Chapter in the Seventh Book on the conversa-\n\n\n\np. 609\n\n\n\ntion between the two As'vins and the Princess Sukanya in S'ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk07ch05.htm)\n\n"
