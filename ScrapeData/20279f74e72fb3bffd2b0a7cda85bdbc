Verily, this (brick-)built Fire-altar (Agni) is this (terrestrial)\nworld:--the waters (of the encircling ocean) are its (circle of) enclosing-\nstones; the men its Ya _g_ ushmatis (bricks with special formulas); the cattle\nits Sudadohas 1; the plants and trees its earth-fillings (between the layers\nof bricks), its oblations and fire-logs 2; Agni (the terrestrial fire) its\nLokamp _ri_ _n_ a (space-filling brick);--thus this comes to make up the whole\nAgni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler 3; and, verily,\nwhosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-\nfiller 4.\n\n10:5:4:22\\. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the air:--the function of\nheaven and earth (the horizon) is its (circle of) enclosing-stones, for it is\nbeyond the air that heaven and earth meet, and that (junction) is the (circle\nof) enclosing-stones; the birds are its Ya _g_ ushmati bricks, the rain its\nSudadohas, the rays\n\np. 382\n\nof light its earth-fillings, oblations and fire-logs; Vayu (the wind) is its\nspace-filler; thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni\ncomes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to\nbe that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.\n\n10:5:4:33\\. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the sky:--the (heavenly)\nwaters are its enclosing-stones, for even as a case 1 here is closed up so are\nthese worlds (enclosed) within the waters; and the waters beyond these worlds\nare the enclosing-stones;--the gods are the Ya _g_ ushmati bricks; what food\nthere is in that world is its Sudadohas; the Nakshatras (lunar mansions) are\nthe earth-fillings, the oblations and the fire-logs; and \xc3\x82ditya (the sun) is\nthe space-filler;--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni; and the whole\nAgni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus\ncomes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.\n\n10:5:4:44\\. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the sun:--the regions are its\nenclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these 2, because\nthree hundred and sixty regions encircle the sun on all sides;--the rays are\nits Ya _g_ ushmati bricks, for there are three hundred and sixty of these 3,\nand three hundred and sixty rays of the sun; and in that he establishes the Ya\n_g_ ushmatis within the enclosing-stones thereby he establishes the rays in\nthe regions. And what is between the regions and the rays, is its Sudadohas;\nand what food there is in the regions and rays that is the earth-fillings, the\noblations and\n\np. 383\n\nthe fire-logs; and that which is called both 'regions' and 'rays' is the\nspace-filling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni; and the\nwhole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this,\nthus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.\n\n10:5:4:55\\. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the Nakshatras:--for there\nare twenty-seven of these Nakshatras, and twenty-seven secondary stars\naccompany each Nakshatra,--this makes seven hundred and twenty 1, and thirty-\nsix in addition thereto. Now what seven hundred and twenty bricks 2 there are\nof these, they are the three hundred and sixty enclosing-stones and the three\nhundred and sixty Ya _g_ ushmati bricks; and what thirty-six there are in\naddition, they are the thirteenth (intercalary) month, the body (of the\naltar); the trunk 3 (consisting of) thirty, the feet of two, the (channels of\nthe) vital airs of two 4, and the head itself being the (thirty-fifth and)\nthirty-sixth,--and as to there being two of these, it is because ' _s_ iras'\n(head) consists of two syllables;--and what (space) there is between (each)\ntwo\n\np. 384\n\n[paragraph continues] Nakshatras that is the Sudadohas; and what food there is\nin the Nakshatras that is the earth-fillings (between the layers of bricks),\nthe oblations and the fire-logs; and what is called 'nakshatras' that is the\nspace-filling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the\nwhole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this,\nthus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.\n\n10:5:4:66\\. Now, these (amount to) twenty-one B _ri_ hatis 1; and--the\nheavenly world being the twenty-one-fold one 2 and the B _ri_ hati (the great\none)--this (altar) thus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the\ntwenty-one-fold Stoma (hymn-form) and the B _ri_ hati metre.\n\n10:5:4:77\\. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the Metres; for there are\nseven of these metres, increasing by four syllables 3; and the triplets of\nthese make seven hundred and twenty syllables, and thirty-six in addition\nthereto. Now what seven hundred and twenty bricks there are of these, they are\nthe three hundred and sixty enclosing-stones and the three hundred and sixty\nYa _g_ ushmatis; and what thirty-six there are in addition, they are the\nthirteenth month, and the body (of this altar),--the trunk (consisting of)\nthirty, the feet of two,\n\np. 385\n\nthe vital airs of two, and the head itself being the (thirty-fifth and)\nthirty-sixth; and as to there being two of these, it is because ' _s_ iras'\nconsists of two syllables.\n\n10:5:4:88\\. Now the first ten syllables of this B _ri_ hati, consisting of\nthirty-six syllables, make an Ekapada 1 of ten syllables; and the (first)\ntwenty make a Dvipada of twenty syllables; and the (first) thirty a Vira _g_\n2 of thirty syllables; and the (first) thirty-three a (Vira _g_ ) of thirty-\nthree syllables; and the (first) thirty-four a Svara _g_  3 of thirty-four\nsyllables; and in that this fire-altar is built with all metres thereby it is\nan Ati _kh_ andas 4, and (so) indeed are all these bricks 5. And the three\nsyllables 'ish _t_ aka (brick)' are a Gayatri tripada, whence this Agni is\nGayatra; and the three syllables 'm _ri_ d' (clay) and 'apa _h_ ' (water) 6\nalso are a Gayatri tripada: thereby also he is Gayatra. And what is between\n(each two) metres is the\n\np. 386\n\n[paragraph continues] Sudadohas; and the food which is in the metres is the\nearth-fillings, the oblations, and the fire-logs; and what is called 'metres,'\nthat is the space-filling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni;\nand the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows\nthis, comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.\n\n10:5:4:99\\. Now, these (amount to) twenty-one B _ri_ hatis; and--the heavenly\nworld being the twenty-one-fold and the B _ri_ hati\\--this (altar) thus comes\nto be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma and the B\n_ri_ hati metre.\n\n10:5:4:1010\\. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the Year,--the nights are\nits enclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these, because\nthere are three hundred and sixty nights in the year; and the days are its Ya\n_g_ ushmati bricks, for there are three hundred and sixty of these, and three\nhundred and sixty days in the year; and those thirty-six bricks which are over\n1 are the thirteenth month, the body (of the year and the altar), the half-\nmonths and months,--(there being) twenty-four half-months, and twelve months.\nAnd what there is between day and night that is the Sudadohas; and what food\nthere is in the days and nights is the earth-fillings, the oblations, and the\nfire-logs; and what is called 'days and nights' that constitutes the space-\nfilling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole\nAgni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus\ncomes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.\n\np. 387\n\n10:5:4:1111\\. Now, these (amount to) twenty-one B _ri_ hatis; and--the\nheavenly world being the twenty-one-fold and the B _ri_ hati\\--this (altar)\nthus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma\nand the B _ri_ hati metre.\n\n10:5:4:1212\\. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also-is the body,--the bones are\nits enclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these, because\nthere are three hundred and sixty bones in man; the marrow parts are the Ya\n_g_ ushmati bricks, for there are three hundred and sixty of these, and three\nhundred and sixty parts of marrow in man; and those thirty-six bricks which\nare over, are the thirteenth month, the trunk, the vital air (of the altar),--\nin his body there are thirty parts 1, in his feet two, in his vital airs two,\nand in his head two,--as to there being two of these, it is because the head\nconsists of two skull-bones. And that whereby these joints are held together\nis the Sudadohas; and those three whereby this body is covered--to wit, hair,\nskin, and flesh--are the earth-fillings; what he drinks is the oblations, and\nwhat he eats the fire-logs; and what is called the 'body,' that is the space-\nfilling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole\nAgni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus\ncomes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.\n\n10:5:4:1313\\. Now, these (amount to) twenty-one B _ri_ hatis; and--the\nheavenly world being the twenty-one-fold and the B _ri_ hati\\--this (altar)\nthus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma\nand the B _ri_ hati metre.\n\np. 388\n\n10:5:4:1414\\. But, indeed, that built Agni (the fire-altar) is all beings, all\nthe gods; for all the gods, all beings are the waters 1, and that built fire-\naltar is the same as those waters 2;--the navigable streams (round the sun)\nare its enclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these,\nbecause three hundred and sixty navigable streams encircle the sun on all\nsides; and the navigable streams, indeed, are also the Ya _g_ ushmati bricks,\nand there are three hundred and sixty of these, because three hundred and\nsixty navigable streams flow towards 3 the sun. And what is between (each) two\nnavigable rivers is the Sudadohas; and those thirty-six bricks which remain\nover are the same as that thirteenth month, and the body (of this altar, the\nwaters 4,) is the same as this gold man.\n\n10:5:4:1515\\. His feet are that gold plate and lotus-leaf(that is) the waters\nand the sun's orb 5\\--are his feet; his arms are the two spoons, and they are\nIndra and Agni; the two naturally-perforated (bricks) are this earth and the\nair; and the three Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis (all-light) bricks are these deities--\nAgni, Vayu, and\n\np. 389\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc3\x82ditya, for these deities, indeed, are all the light;\nand the twelve seasonal (bricks) are the year, the body (of the altar, and the\ngold man); and the five Nakasads and five Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as are the\nsacrifice, the gods; and the Vikar _n_ i the (third) Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a\nand the variegated stone 1; and the fire which is deposited (on the altar 1)\nis the thirty-fifth; and the formula of the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a (brick) 2 is the\nthirty-sixth;--that (gold man), indeed, the body (of the altar) is the end of\neverything here 3: he is in the midst of all the waters, endowed with all\nobjects of desire--for all objects of desire are the waters 4; whilst\npossessed of all (objects of) desires he is without desire, for no desire of\nanything (troubles) him 5.\n\n10:5:4:1616\\. Regarding this there is this verse--'By knowledge 6 they ascend\nthat (state) where desires have vanished 7: sacrificial gifts go not thither\n8, nor the fervid practisers of rites without knowledge;'--for, indeed, he who\ndoes not know this does not attain to that world either by sacrificial gifts\nor by devout\n\np. 390\n\npractices, but only to those who know does that world belong.\n\n10:5:4:1717\\. The welkin is the earth-fillings (between the layers of brick);\nthe moon the oblations; the Nakshatras (lunar mansions) the fire-logs,--\nbecause the moon resides in (or with) the Nakshatra, therefore the oblation\nresides in the fire-wood: that 1, indeed, is the food of the oblation, and its\nsupport; whence the oblation does not fail (na kshiyate), for that is its food\nand its support And what are called 'the gods' they are the space-filling\n(brick); for by (naming) the gods everything here is named.\n\n10:5:4:1818 It is regarding this that it is said by the _Ri_ _k_ (X, 12, 3),\n'The All-gods have gone after this thy Ya _g_ us,'--for all beings, all the\ngods, indeed, become the Ya _g_ us here. Thus this whole Agni comes to be the\nspace-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole\n(Agni) who is the space-filler.\n\n10:5:4:1919\\. Now, these (amount to) twenty-one B _ri_ hatis; and--the\nheavenly world being the twenty-one-fold and the B _ri_ hati\\--this (altar)\nthus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma\nand the B _ri_ hati metre.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[381:1](sbe4369.htm#fr_764) That is, either the food obtained by the milking\nof the drink of immortality (am _ri_ tadohannam), or the verse _Ri_ g-veda\nVIII, 69, 3 (ta asya sudadohasa _h_ , &c.) pronounced over the 'settled'\nbrick, and supposed to supply vital air to the different parts of Agni-Pra _g_\napati's body (whence it is also repeated in the B _ri_ had Uktham between the\ndifferent parts of the bird-like body; cf. [p. 112](sbe4324.htm#page_112),\nnote [1](sbe4324.htm#fn_204)). Say.\n\n[381:2](sbe4369.htm#fr_765) Saya _n_ a seems to interpret this in two\ndifferent ways,--oshadhivanaspataya eva purishahutisamittrayarupa etasya\npurishahutisamittrayarupatvam uttaratra spash _t_ ikarishyate; atha (va) yad\ndikshu _k_ a ra _s_ mishu _k_ anna _m_ tat purisha _m_ ta ahutayas ta _h_\nsamidha _h_.\n\n[381:3](sbe4369.htm#fr_766) See [X, 5, 2, 8](sbe4367.htm#10:5:2:8). Viz.\n'inasmuch as all become fit for their work by being provided with fire.' Say.\n\n[381:4](sbe4369.htm#fr_767) Or, the word-filler, the ruler of the world\n(lokadhish _th_ at _ri_ ). Say.\n\n[382:1](sbe4369.htm#fr_768) Or, as (the valves, or shells, of) a pod are\nclosed up.\n\n[382:2](sbe4369.htm#fr_769) See [p. 354](sbe4362.htm#page_354), note\n[2](sbe4362.htm#fn_691).\n\n[382:3](sbe4369.htm#fr_770) See [IX, 4, 3, 6](sbe4341.htm#9:4:3:6).\n\n[383:1](sbe4369.htm#fr_771) On this inaccurate calculation (the real product\nbeing 729), resorted to in order to get a total amount equal to the number of\nYa _g_ ushmati bricks (756), see A. Weber, Nakshatra, II, p. 298.\n\n[383:2](sbe4369.htm#fr_772) That is, Nakshatras considered as the bricks of\nwhich the fire-altar is constructed. The latter being identical with the year,\nthe 720 bricks represent the days and nights of the year.\n\n[383:3](sbe4369.htm#fr_773) Thus Saya _n_ a (madhyadeha),--the atman (in that\ncase, however, the whole body) is usually represented as consisting of twenty-\nfive parts. Here the thirty parts would probably be the trunk, the head, the\nupper and fore-arms, the thighs and shanks, and the fingers and toes.\n\n[383:4](sbe4369.htm#fr_774) Viz. inasmuch as eyes, ears, and nostrils are in\npairs. Say.\n\n[384:1](sbe4369.htm#fr_775) The B _ri_ hati verse consisting of 36 syllables,\nthis makes a total of 756 syllables, or the same amount as that of the days\nand nights of the year, plus the days (36) of the intercalary month.\n\n[384:2](sbe4369.htm#fr_776) Viz. inasmuch as the sun is 'the twenty-first,'\ncf. I, 3, 5, 11; VI, 2, 2, 3: svargas tv aditya iti surake(tu)rupo va loka _h_\nsvarga _h_ ekavi _m_ _s_ atisa _m_ khyapuraka _h_. Say\n\n[384:3](sbe4369.htm#fr_777) The seven metres, increasing by four syllables\nfrom 24 up to 48, consist together of 252 syllables, and hence the triplets of\nthem amount to 756 = 720 + 36 syllables.\n\n[385:1](sbe4369.htm#fr_778) The Ekapada is a verse consisting of a single\npada, and the Dvipada one of two padas, whilst verses in the ordinary metres\nconsist of three or four padas.\n\n[385:2](sbe4369.htm#fr_779) The Vira _g_ is a metre consisting of 1 to 4\n(usually 3) decasyllabic padas; the one consisting of four such padas being,\nhowever, commonly called Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti. Besides this, the principal, Vira _g_ , there\nis, however, another consisting of 3 padas of 11 syllables each.\n\n[385:3](sbe4369.htm#fr_780) This name, which is here applied to a verse of 34\nsyllables, was in VII, 4, 1, 9 used of a verse of 10 + 10 + 11 + 11 = 42\nsyllables (Va _g_. S. XI, 29); cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII, p. 63.\n\n[385:4](sbe4369.htm#fr_781) That is, an over-metre, excessive metre,\nconsisting of more than 48 syllables. The fire-altar, being built up with all\nthe metres (viz. with the _Kh_ andasya bricks, representing the metres, cf.\n[VIII, 3, 3, 1](sbe4313.htm#8:3:3:1) seqq.), would thus-far exceed the latter\nnumber.\n\n[385:5](sbe4369.htm#fr_782) ? Thus Saya _n_ a: _k_ ityagnir ati _kh_ anda iti\nyat tena sarva ish _t_ aka ati _kh_ andomayya ity uktam.\n\n[385:6](sbe4369.htm#fr_783) That is, the materials used for making bricks.\n\n[386:1](sbe4369.htm#fr_784) Viz. those required to make up the 756 Ya _g_\nushmatis.\n\n[387:1](sbe4369.htm#fr_785) See p. 383, note 3.\n\n[388:1](sbe4369.htm#fr_786) Viz. inasmuch as they are the foundation and\nultimate source of the universe; cf. VI, 8, 2, 2. 3; and everything is\ncontained therein, [X, 5, 4, 3](sbe4369.htm#10:5:4:3).\n\n[388:2](sbe4369.htm#fr_787) Viz. inasmuch as the built Agni is the same as the\nsun, and the sun is surrounded by water; cf. [p. 368](sbe4367.htm#page_368),\nnote [1](sbe4367.htm#fn_719).\n\n[388:3](sbe4369.htm#fr_788) It is not clear whether these rivers are meant to\nbe different ones from those flowing round the sun, or whether they are the\nsame as 'washing against' the sun.\n\n[388:4](sbe4369.htm#fr_789) Athokteshu paryayeshv agnyavayava-trayoda _s_\namasatmika atma agnyatmana dhyeyanam apam atmety artha _h_. Say.\n\n[388:5](sbe4369.htm#fr_790) That is, in regard to the sacrifice, the gold\nplate and lotus-leaf are his feet, and in regard to the deity, the waters and\nthe sun's disk. Say. They are, nevertheless, counted as four.\n\n[389:1](sbe4369.htm#fr_792) For this stone, which was deposited near the\n\xc3\x82gnidhriya shed, and afterwards placed in the \xc3\x82gnidhra hearth, see [p.\n243](sbe4341.htm#page_243), note [2](sbe4341.htm#fn_410).\n\n[389:2](sbe4369.htm#fr_793) See [VIII, 7, 2, 6](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:6).\n\n[389:3](sbe4369.htm#fr_794) See [X, 5, 2,\n6](sbe4367.htm#10:5:2:6)-[8](sbe4367.htm#10:5:2:8).\n\n[389:4](sbe4369.htm#fr_795) Sa eva . . . sha _t_ tri _m_ _s_ adish _t_ akamayo\nhira _n_ maya _h_ purusha atma sarvabhutadevatmanam apam agnyatmana dhyeyanam\nmadhye vartate.
