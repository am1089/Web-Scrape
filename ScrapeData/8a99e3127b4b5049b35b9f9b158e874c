That year, doubtless, amounts to a B _ri_ hati\\--,there are two\nsha _d_ ahas (12) of winning days  2; the\n\np. 156\n\ntwo, P _ri_ sh _th_ ya and Abhiplava (12); the Go and \xc3\x82yus, and the Da _s_\naratra (ten days)--that makes thirty-six; for the B _ri_ hati consists of\nthirty-six syllables, and by means of the B _ri_ hati the gods strove to reach\nheaven, and by the B _ri_ hati they did gain heaven; and in like manner does\nthis one, by means of the B _ri_ hati, now strive to reach heaven, and thereby\ngain heaven; he who knows this secures for himself whatever wish there is in\nthe B _ri_ hati.\n\n12:2:3:22\\. And as to the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a day, it is the same as either\nthe seventh or the ninth (day) of the Da _s_ aratra 1 From out of the\nAbhiplava the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya is formed, from the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya the Abhi\n_g_ it,\n\np. 157\n\nfrom the Abhi _g_ it the Svarasamans, from the Svarasamans the Vishuvat, from\nthe Vishuvat the Svarasamans, from the Svarasamans the Vi _s_ va _g_ it, from\nthe Vi _s_ va _g_ it the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya 1, from the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya the\nAbhiplava, from the Abhiplava the Go and \xc3\x82yus, and from the Go and \xc3\x82yus the Da\n_s_ aratra.\n\n12:2:3:33\\. And that Mahavrata is a winning-day, for its Stoma is the Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ avi _m_ _s_ a, and a metre does not collapse from (excess or deficiency\nof) a syllable--neither from one nor from two (syllables); neither does a\nStoma by (an excess of) one hymn-verse 2.\n\n12:2:3:44\\. Prior to the Vishuvat they perform first the Abhiplava, and\nafterwards the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya, for the Abhiplava represents the sons, and\nthe P _ri_ sh _th_ ya the father; whence in early life the sons subsist on\n(the resources of) their father. Subsequent to the Vishuvat they perform first\nthe P _ri_ sh _th_ ya, and afterwards the Abhiplava; whence in later life the\nfather subsists on (the resources of) his sons; and, verily, the sons of him\nwho thus knows this subsist on him in early life, and he subsists on his sons\nin later life.\n\n12:2:3:55\\. Here, now, they ask, 'If he were to die after entering on the _K_\naturvi _m_ _s_ a day, how does he become one who has not merely (uttered) the\n\np. 158\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc3\x82gur-formula 1?' Let him say, 'In that they then perform\nthe Opening Atiratra, thereby (he becomes such a one).'\n\n12:2:3:66\\. As to this they ask, 'Seeing that there are the twelve months of\nthe year, and that one day, to wit, the Vishuvat, is in excess, does this\nbelong to those (months) that go before or to those that follow?' Let him say,\n'Both to those that go before and to those that follow;' for the Vishuvat is\nthe body (trunk) of the year, and the months are its limbs; and where the body\nis there are (or, that includes) also the limbs, and where the limbs are there\nis also the body; and neither is the body in excess of the limbs, nor are the\nlimbs in excess of the body: and thus, indeed, that (day) belongs both to\nthose (months) that go before and to those that follow.\n\n12:2:3:77\\. But, indeed, that year is a great eagle: the six months which they\nperform prior to the Vishuvat are the one wing, and those which they perform\nsubsequent thereto are the other; and the Vishuvat is the body; and, indeed,\nwhere the body is there are also the wings, and where the wings are there is\nalso the body; for neither is the body in excess of the wings, nor are the\nwings in excess of the body: and thus, indeed, that (day) belongs both to\nthose (months) that go before and to those that follow.\n\n12:2:3:88\\. As to this they ask, 'Seeing that for six months prior to the\nVishuvat they- perform Stomas tending upwards, and for six (months) reversed\n\np. 159\n\n[paragraph continues] (Stomas), how are these latter performed so as to tend\nupwards?' Let him say, 'In that they perform that Da _s_ aratra as one with\nupward tending Stomas, thereby they do so.' Now, the Mahavrata did not yield\nitself to the gods saying, 'How is it, ye have performed the Vishuvat with\nupward tending hymns, and me with reversed ones?'\n\n12:2:3:99\\. The gods said, 'Try ye to find out that sacrificial performance\nwhich has upward tending Stomas, and whereby we may gain this.' They saw that\nDa _s_ aratra with upward tending Stomas after the manner of the year: what P\n_ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha there is in it that is the seasons, the (three)\n_Kh_ andomas are these worlds, and the tenth day is the year. Thereby they\ngained this (Mahavrata), and it yielded itself to them; and, verily, the\nMahavrata yields itself to him who so knows this.\n\n12:2:3:1010\\. And in this way, indeed, there is an ascent of days:--by means\nof the Opening Atiratra they ascend the concluding Atiratra, by means of the\n_K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a the Mahavrata, by means of an Abhiplava a subsequent\nAbhiplava, by means of a P _ri_ sh _th_ ya a subsequent P _ri_ sh _th_ ya, by\nmeans of the Abhi _g_ it the Vi _s_ va _g_ it, by means of the Svarasamans the\nsubsequent Svarasamans--but that one day is not ascended, to wit, the\nVishuvat: and, verily, he who thus knows this ascends to (the state of) one\nmore glorious, and no one inferior to him ascends (to be equal) to him.\n\n12:2:3:1111\\. And in this way, indeed, there is a descent of days:--the Praya\n_n_ iya Atiratra descends to the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a day, the _K_ aturvi _m_\n_s_ a day to the Abhiplava, the Abhiplava to the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya, the P _ri_\nsh _th_ ya to the Abhi _g_ it, the Abhi _g_ it to the Svarasamans, the\n\np. 160\n\n[paragraph continues] Svarasamans to the Vishuvat, the Vishuvat to the\nSvarasamans, the Svarasamans to the Vi _s_ va _g_ it, the Vi _s_ va _g_ it to\nthe P _ri_ sh _th_ ya, the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya to the Abhiplava, the Abhiplava\nto the Go and \xc3\x82yus, the Go and \xc3\x82yus to the Da _s_ aratra, the Da _s_ aratra to\nthe Mahavrata, the Mahavrata to the Udayaniya Atiratra, the Udayaniya Atiratra\nto the world of heaven, to the resting-place, to plenty.\n\n12:2:3:1212\\. Such, indeed, are the wilds and ravines of sacrifice, and they\n(take) hundreds upon hundreds of days' carriage-drives; and if any venture\ninto them without knowledge, then hunger or thirst, evil-doers and fiends\nharass them, even as fiends would harass foolish men wandering in a wild\nforest; but if those who know this do so, they pass from one duty to another,\nas from one stream into another, and from one safe place to another, and\nobtain well-being, the world of heaven.\n\n12:2:3:1313\\. As to this they say, 'How many onward, and how many backward\ndays are there?' Well, those which are performed once each are onward days,\nand those which are performed repeatedly are backward days: let him at least\nconsider these 1 as backward ones, for in accordance with the course of the\nSha _d_ ahas he himself moves.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[155:2](sbe44051.htm#fr_467) The term 'arkshyat' is apparently a future\nparticiple of 'a-ar _g_ ,' p. 156 hence 'calculated to procure, or win.' The\nAit.-Br. has 'akshyat' instead. The two Sha _d_ ahas (or periods of six days),\nhere counted as such days, would seem to include the six Svarasaman days, and\nthe special named days scattered over the session (the opening and concluding\nAtiratra being apparently counted as one).\n\n[156:1](sbe44051.htm#fr_468) _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a day is one in which the _K_\naturvi _m_ _s_ a-stoma, or twenty-four-fold hymn-form, is exclusively used in\nthe chanting of the Stotras. The one usually denoted by that term is the\nsecond day of the Gavam ayanam. In the Da _s_ aratra, or ten-days' period,\nthere is, however, likewise a day in which the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a-stoma is\nused exclusively. That period consists of a P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha (six\ndays), three _Kh_ andoma days, and a final Atyagnish _t_ oma, called Avivakya.\nThe three _Kh_ andoma days (i.e. days fashioned after metres) have assigned to\nthem as their exclusive Stomas the twenty-four-fold, the forty-four-fold, and\nthe forty-eight-fold hymn-forms respectively; the first of them, or the\nseventh day of the Da _s_ aratra, being thus a _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a day. But\nin the second half of the year's session the regular order of the days of the\nminor sacrificial periods--the Sha _d_ ahas and Svarasamans--is reversed, the\nlast day being performed first; and according to this paragraph the same is\noptionally to be the case in regard to the three _Kh_ andoma days, the _K_\naturvi _m_ _s_ a day being taken either first or last (see, however, parag.\n9). Cf. also Haug, Ait.-Br., Transl., p. 347, note (where, in l. 3, read Da\n_s_ aratra instead of Dvada _s_ aha).\n\n[157:1](sbe44051.htm#fr_469) Here, the order of Abhiplava and P _ri_ sh _th_\nya followed in the first half of the year is reversed.\n\n[157:2](sbe44051.htm#fr_470) The author apparently claims for the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\navi _m_ _s_ a-stoma, or twenty-five-versed hymn-form, the same efficacy as for\nthe _k_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a-stoma, the hymn-form of what is practically the first\nday of the sacrificial session (cf. Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Br. XXV, 1, 1, where it is\ncalled _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a _m_ praya _n_ iyam), and which by the number of\nits stotriya-verses, being that of the half-months in the course of the year\n(24), is supposed to represent the whole year; cf. Ait.-Br. IV, 52.\n\n[158:1](sbe44051.htm#fr_471) See XI, 2, 5, 10 with note. (There is no\nparagraph XI, 2, 5, 10--JBH.) The Katurvi _m_ _s_ a day is, as it were, a\npromise on the part of the Sacrificer to perform the sacrificial session;\nwhilst the Praya _n_ iya Atiratra not only represents the actual entering on\nthe performance, but, as it were, implies the Udayaniya Atiratra ([XII, 2, 2,\n18](sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:18)).\n\n[160:1](sbe44051.htm#fr_472) Or, 'meditate upon these' (? worship these); see\n[p. 155](sbe44050.htm#page_155), note [1](sbe44050.htm#fn_466).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 2, 4.
