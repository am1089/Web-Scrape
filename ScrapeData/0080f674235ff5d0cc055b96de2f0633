If it be said that on account of the denial (it is not so); we deny this.\nFrom the embodied soul; for (that one is) clear, according to some.\n\np. 734\n\nThe contention that the soul of him who knows departs from the body in the\nsame way as other souls do cannot be upheld, since Scripture expressly\nnegatives such departure. For B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, at first describes the mode\nof departure on the part of him who does not possess true knowledge ('He\ntaking to himself those elements of light descends into the heart' up to\n'after him thus departing the Pra _n_ a departs'); then refers to his assuming\nanother body ('he makes to himself another, newer and more beautiful shape');\nthen concludes the account of him who does not possess true knowledge ('having\nattained the end of these works whatever he does here, he again returns from\nthat world to this world of action. So much for the man who desires'); and\nthereupon proceeds explicitly to deny the departure from the body of him who\npossesses true knowledge, 'But he who does not desire, who is without desire,\nfree from desire, who has obtained his desire, who desires the Self only, of\nhim (tasya) the pra _n_ as do not pass forth,--being Brahman only he goes into\nBrahman.' Similarly a previous section also, viz. the one containing the\nquestions put by \xc3\x85rtabhaga, directly negatives the view of the soul of him who\nknows passing out of the body. There the clause 'he again conquers death'\nintroduces him who knows as the subject-matter, and after that the text\ncontinues: 'Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya, he said, when that person dies, do the pra _n_ as\npass out of him (asmat) or not?--No, said Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya, they are gathered\nup in him (atraiva), he swells, inflated the dead lies' (B _ri_. Up. III, 2,\n10-11). From these texts it follows that he who knows attains to immortality\n_here_ (without his soul passing out of the body and moving to another place).\n--This view the Sutra rejects. 'Not so; from the embodied soul.' What those\ntexts deny is the moving away of the pra _n_ as from the embodied individual\nsoul, not from the body. 'Of him (tasya) the pra _n_ as do not pass forth'--\nhere the 'of him' refers to the subject under discussion, i.e. the embodied\nsoul which is introduced by the clause 'he who does not desire,' not to the\nbody which the text had not previously mentioned. The sixth case (tasya) here\ndenotes the embodied soul as\n\np. 735\n\nthat which is connected with the pra _n_ as ('the pra _n_ as belonging to\nthat, i.e. the soul, do not pass out'), not as that from which the passing out\ntakes its start.--But why should the 'tasya ' not denote the body as the point\nof starting ('the pra _n_ as do not pass forth from that (tasya), viz. the\nbody')?--Because, we reply, the soul which is actually mentioned in its\nrelation of connexion with the pra _n_ as (as indicated by tasya) suggests\nitself to the mind more immediately than the body which is not mentioned at\nall; if therefore the question arises as to the starting-point of the passing\nforth of the pra _n_ as the soul is (on the basis of the text) apprehended as\nthat starting-point also (i.e. the clause 'the pra _n_ as of him do not pass\nforth' implies at the same time 'the pra _n_ as do not pass forth from him,\ni.e. from the soul'). Moreover, as the pra _n_ as are well known to be\nconnected with the soul and as hence it would serve no purpose to state that\nconnexion, we conclude that the sixth case which expresses connexion in\ngeneral is here meant to denote the starting-point in particular. And no\ndispute on this point is really possible; since 'according to some' it is\n'clear' that what the text means to express is the embodied soul as the\nstarting-point of the pra _n_ as. The _some_ are the Madhyandinas, who in\ntheir text of the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka read 'na tasmat pra _n_ a\nutkramanti'--'the pra _n_ as do not pass forth _from him_ ' (the 'tasya' thus\nbeing the reading of the Ka _n_ va _S_ akha only).--But, an objection is\nraised, there is no motive for explicitly negativing the passing away of the\npra _n_ as from the soul; for there is no reason to assume that there should\nbe such a passing away (and the general rule is that a denial is made of that\nonly for which there is a presumption).--Not so, we reply. The _Kh_ andogya-\ntext 'For him there is delay only as long as he is not delivered (from the\nbody); then he will be united' declares that the soul becomes united with\nBrahman at the time of its separation from the body, and this suggests the\nidea of the soul of him who knows separating itself at that very time (i.e.\nthe time of death) from the pra _n_ as also. But this would mean that the soul\ncannot reach union with Brahman by\n\np. 736\n\nmeans of proceeding on the path of the gods, and for this reason the B _ri_\nhad-ara _n_ yaka ('of him the pra _n_ as do not pass forth') explicitly\ndeclares that the pra _n_ as do not depart from the soul of him who knows,\nbefore that soul proceeding on the path of the gods attains to union with\nBrahman.\n\nThe same line of refutation would have to be applied to the arguments founded\nby our opponent on the question of \xc3\x82rtabhaga, if that question be viewed as\nreferring to him who possesses true knowledge. The fact however is that that\npassage refers to him who does _not_ possess that knowledge; for none of the\nquestions and answers of which the section consists favours the presumption of\nthe knowledge of Brahman being under discussion. The matters touched upon in\nthose questions and answers are the nature of the senses and sense objects\nviewed as graha and atigraha; water being the food of fire; the non-separation\nof the pra _n_ as from the soul at the time of death; the continuance of the\nfame--there called _name_ \\--of the dead man; and the attainment, on the part\nof the soul of the departed, to conditions of existence corresponding to his\ngood or evil deeds. The passage immediately preceding the one referring to the\nnon-departure of the pra _n_ as merely means that death is conquered in so far\nas it is a fire and fire is the food of water; this has nothing to do with the\nowner of true knowledge. The statement that the pra _n_ as of the ordinary man\nwho does not possess true knowledge do not depart means that at the time of\ndeath the pra _n_ as do not, like the gross body, abandon the _g_ iva, but\ncling to it like the subtle body and accompany it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13.
