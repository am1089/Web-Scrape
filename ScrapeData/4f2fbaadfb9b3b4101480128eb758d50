But the fashioning of names and forms belongs to him who renders\ntripartite, on account of the teaching (of scripture).\n\nIn the chapter treating of the Being (sat), subsequently to the account of the\ncreation of fire, water, and food (earth), the following statement is made,\n\'That divinity thought, let me now enter those three beings with this living\nSelf ( _g_ iva atma), and let me evolve names and forms 1;--let me make each\nof these three tripartite\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, Kh 3, 2; 3).--Here the doubt arises\nwhether the agent in that evolution of names and forms is the _g_ iva (the\nliving, i.e. the individual Self or soul) or the highest Lord.--The\npurvapakshin maintains the former alternative, on account of the qualification\ncontained in the words \'with this living Self.\' The use of ordinary language\ndoes, in such phrases as \'Having entered the army of the enemy by means of a\nspy I count it,\' attribute the counting of the army in which the spy is the\nreal agent to the Self of the king who is the causal agent; which attribution\nis effected by means of the use of the first person, \'I count.\' So here the\nsacred text attributes the evolving of names and forms--in which the _g_ iva\nis the real agent--to the Self of the divinity which is the causal agent; the\nattribution being effected by means\n\np. 97\n\nof the use of the first person, \'let me evolve."--Moreover we see in the case\nof names such as _D_ ittha, _D_ avittha, &c., and in the case of forms such as\njars, dishes and the like that the individual soul only is the evolving agent\n1. Hence the evolution of names and forms is the work of the _g_ iva.\n\nTo this the Sutra replies: \'But the fashioning of names and forms belongs to\nhim who renders tripartite.\' The particle \'but\' discards the purvapaksha.\nFashioning means evolving. The term \'he who renders tripartite\' denotes the\nhighest Lord, his agency being designated as beyond contradiction in the case\nof the rendering tripartite (of fire, &c.). The entire evolution of names and\nforms which is seen, e.g. in fire, sun, moon, lightning, or in different\nplants such as ku _s_ a-grass, ka _s_ a-grass, pala _s_ a-trees, or in various\nliving beings such as cattle, deer, men, all this manifold evolution according\nto species and individuals can surely be the work of the highest Lord only,\nwho fashioned fire, water, and earth.--Why?--On account of the teaching of the\nsacred text.--For the text says at first \'that divinity,\' &c., and then goes\non in the first person \'let me evolve;\' which implies the statement that the\nhighest Brahman only is the evolving agent.--But we ascertain from the\nqualification contained in the words \'with this living Self,\' that the agent\nin the evolution is the living Self!--No, we reply. The words \'with this\nliving Self are connected with the words \'having entered,\' in proximity to\nwhich they stand; not with the clause \'let me evolve.\' If they were connected\nwith the former words, we should have to assume that the first person, which\nrefers to the divinity--viz. \'let me evolve\'--is used in a metaphorical sense.\nAnd with regard to all the manifold names and forms such as mountains, rivers,\noceans, &c., no soul, apart from the Lord, possesses the power of evolution;\nand if any have such power, it is dependent on the highest Lord. Nor is the\nso-called \'living Self\' absolutely different from the highest Lord, as the spy\nis from the king; as we see from its being qualified\n\np. 98\n\nas the living Self, and as its being the _g_ iva. an individual soul\napparently differing from the universal Self) is due to the limiting adjuncts\nonly. Hence the evolution of names and forms which is effected by it is in\nreality effected by the highest Lord. And that the highest Lord is he who\nevolves the names and forms is a principle acknowledged by all the Upanishads;\nas we see from such passages as \'He who is called ether is the evolver of all\nforms and names\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 14). The evolution of names and forms,\ntherefore, is exclusively the work of the highest Lord, who is also the author\nof the tripartite arrangement.--The meaning of the text is that the evolution\nof names and forms was preceded by the tripartition, the evolution of each\nparticular name and form being already explained by the account of the origin\nof fire, water, and earth. The act of tripartition is expressly described by\n_S_ ruti in the cases of fire, sun, moon, and lightning, \'The red colour of\nburning fire is the colour of fire, the white colour of fire is the colour of\nwater, the black colour of fire the colour of earth,\' &c. In this way there is\nevolved the distinctive form of fire, and in connexion therewith the\ndistinctive name \'fire,\' the name depending on the thing. The same remarks\napply to the cases of the sun, the moon, and lightning. The instance (given by\nthe text) of the tripartition of fire implies the statement that the three\nsubstances, viz. earth, water, fire, were rendered tripartite in the same\nmanner; as the beginning as well as the concluding clause of the passage\nequally refers to all three. For the beginning clause says, \'These three\nbeings became each of them tripartite;\' and the concluding clause says,\n\'Whatever they thought looked red they knew was the colour of fire,\' &c. &c.,\nup to \'Whatever they thought was altogether unknown they knew was some\ncombination of these three beings.\' Having thus described the external\ntripartition of the three elements the text goes on to describe another\ntripartition with reference to man, those three beings when they reach man\nbecome each of them tripartite.\' This tripartition in man the teacher sets\nforth (in the following Sutra) according to scripture, with a view to the\nrefutation of some foreseen objection.\n\np. 99\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[96:1](sbe38074.htm#fr_62) Literally, with this living Self having entered let\nme evolve, &c.\n\n[97:1](sbe38074.htm#fr_63) Names being given and vessels being shaped by a\nclass of _g_ ivas, viz. men.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 21](sbe38075.htm)\n\n'
