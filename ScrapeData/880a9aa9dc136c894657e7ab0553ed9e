He then lays down the Valakhilyas;--the Valakhilyas, doubtless, are\nthe vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus lays (into Agni). And as to why\nthey are called Valakhilyas,--what (unploughed piece of ground lies) between\ntwo cultivated fields is called\n\np. 55\n\n[paragraph continues] 'khila;' and these (channels of the) vital airs 1 are\nseparated from each other by the width of a horsehair (vala), and because they\nare separated from each other by the width of a horse-hair, they (the bricks)\nare called Valakhilyas.\n\n8:3:4:22\\. He places seven in front, and seven at the back. When he places\nseven in front, he thereby restores to him those seven (organs of the) vital\nairs here in front.\n\n8:3:4:33\\. And those seven which (he places) behind he thereby makes the\ncounter-breathings to those (first breathings); and hence by means of (the\nchannels of) these breathings he passes over the food which he eats with those\n(other) breathings.\n\n8:3:4:44\\. And, again, as to why he places seven in front,--there are seven\n(channels of the) vital airs here in the front part (of the animal) 2\\--the\nfour upper and lower parts of the fore-feet, the head, the neck, and what is\nabove the navel that is the sixth, for in each limb there is a vital air: this\nmakes seven vital airs here in front; it is them he thus lays into him (Agni-\nPra _g_ apati).\n\n8:3:4:55\\. And as to what seven (bricks) he places behind,--there are seven\nvital airs here in the back part--the four thighs and knee-bones, the two\nfeet, and what is below the navel that is the seventh, for in each limb there\nis a vital air: this makes seven vital airs here at the back; it is them he\nthus lays into him.\n\n8:3:4:66\\. [He lays them down, with, Va _g_. S. XIV, 21,22], 'The head thou\nart, the ruler! steady thou\n\np. 56\n\nart, steadfast! a holder thou art, a hold!'--'A guider, a ruler! a guider thou\nart, a guide! steady thou art, a steadier!' he truly bestows steady vital airs\nunto him.\n\n8:3:4:77\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Valakhilyas,--it was by\nmeans of the Valakhilyas that the gods then ranged over these worlds, both\nfrom hence upwards and from yonder downwards; and in like manner does the\nsacrifice now, by means of the Valakhilyas, range over these worlds, both from\nhence upwards and from yonder downwards.\n\n8:3:4:88\\. By 'The head thou art, the ruler!' they stepped on this\n(terrestrial) world; by 'Steady thou art, steadfast!' on the air-world; by 'A\nholder thou art, a hold!' on that (heavenly) world.--'For life-strength (I\nbestow) thee! for vigour thee! for husbandry thee! for prosperity thee!' There\nare four (kinds of) four-footed (domestic) animals, and (domestic) animals are\nfood: by means of this food, these four four-footed animals, they (the gods)\nestablished themselves in yonder world; and in like manner does the Sacrificer\nnow by means of this food, these four four-footed animals, establish himself\nin yonder world.\n\n8:3:4:99\\. That was, as it were, an ascent away from hence; but this (earth)\nis a foothold: the gods came back to this foothold; and in like manner does\nthe Sacrificer now come back to this foothold.\n\n8:3:4:1010\\. By 'A guider, a ruler!' they stepped on that (heavenly) world; by\n'A guider thou art, a guide!' on the air-world; by 'Steady thou art, a\nsteadier!' on this ([terrestrial](errata.htm#1)) world.--'For sap (I bestow)\nthee! for strength thee! for wealth thee! for thrift thee!'--There are four\nfour-footed (domestic) animals,\n\np. 57\n\nand (domestic) animals are food: by means of this food, these four four-footed\nanimals, they (the gods) established themselves in this world; and in like\nmanner does the Sacrificer, by means of this food, these four four-footed\nanimals, establish himself in this world.\n\n8:3:4:1111\\. Now as to the restoration (of Pra _g_ apati-Agni). Those eleven\nbricks he lays down 1, which (constitute) that first anuvaka 2, are the air\nand this body (of Agni, the altar). And as to why there are eleven of these,\nit is because the Trish _t_ ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the air is\nof the trish _t_ ubh nature. And the sixty subsequent (bricks) are Vayu, Pra\n_g_ apati, Agni, the Sacrificer.\n\n8:3:4:1212\\. Those which he places in front are his head: there are ten 3 of\nthem, because there are ten vital airs, and the head is (the focus of) the\nvital airs. He places them in front, because the head (of an animal) is here\nin front.\n\n8:3:4:1313\\. And those which he places on the right (south) side are that\n(part) of him which is above the waist and below the head. And those at the\nback are that (part) of him which is above the feet and below the waist. Those\non the left (north) side are the feet themselves.\n\n8:3:4:1414\\. And the seven (Valakhilyas) which he places in front are these\nseven vital airs here in the forepart (of an animal): it is these he thus puts\ninto\n\np. 58\n\nhim (Agni). He places them so as not to he separated from those ten (Pra _n_\nabh _ri_ ts): he thereby puts in vital airs that are not separate from the\nhead.\n\n8:3:4:1515\\. And the seven he places at the back (of the altar) are those\nseven vital airs behind: it is these he thereby puts into him. He places them\nso as not to be separated from those twelve ( _Kh_ andasyas): he thereby puts\ninto him vital airs that are not separate from the body. That same Vayu-Pra\n_g_ apati is turned round in all directions in this trish _t_ ubh-like air;\nand when he lays down the third layer, having made up both Vayu (the wind) and\nthe air, he thereby adds them to himself. He then puts down two Lokamp _ri_\n_n_ a (space-filling bricks) in that corner 1: the significance of them (will\nbe explained) further on 2. He throws loose earth (on the layer): the\nsignificance of this (will be explained) further on 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[55:1](sbe4314.htm#fr_123) Or, these bricks representing the vital airs.\n\n[55:2](sbe4314.htm#fr_124) Or, in the upper part of man.\n\n[57:1](sbe4314.htm#fr_125) That is to say, the first eleven bricks of the\nthird layer, viz. one svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a, four di _s_ yas, one vi _s_ va\n_g_ yotis, and four _ri_ tavyas.\n\n[57:2](sbe4314.htm#fr_126) The formulas used with these bricks, Va _g_.
