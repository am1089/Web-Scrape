By (a nature) like that of Brahman (the soul manifests itself); (thus) _G_\naimini (opines); on account of reference and the rest.\n\nIt has been concluded that the clause, 'by its own nature,' means that the\nsoul manifests itself by its own Self only, not by some other adventitious\ncharacter. What has now to be inquired into is the specific qualities of that\nnature. Here the Sutra at first states the opinion of the teacher _G_ aimini.\nAccording to him the soul's own nature is 'like that of Brahman,' i.e. it\ncomprises all the qualities beginning with freeness from sin and concluding\nwith truthfulness of conception (i.e. the qualities enumerated in _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 7, 1), and also omniscience and omnipotence; and in this nature the soul\nmanifests itself.--Why so?--Because this is known from reference 1 and the\nrest. For the reference\n\np. 409\n\nto certain qualities made in VIII, 7, 1, teaches that the Selfhood of the Self\nis such (i.e. such as made up of those qualities).--Again, the passage, 'He\nthere moves about eating, playing, rejoicing,' shows that the Self possesses\nlordly power; so also the passage, 'For him there is free movement in all\nworlds' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 6). And thus also there is justification for such\ndesignations as 'All-knowing; all-powerful.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[408:1](sbe38322.htm#fr_232) The commentators say that the 'and the rest' of\nthe Sutra comprises vidhi and vyapade _s_ a, and give the following\ndefinitions. p. 409 Upanyasa is the reference to something known (established\nelsewhere), which reference is made with a view to a vidhi, i.e. the\nestablishing of something not yet known (upanyaso namoddesa _h_ sa _k_\na\xe0\xa4\xbdnyatra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ atasya\xe0\xa4\xbdnyavidhanayanuvada _h_ ). Thus here the qualities--\nfreeness from sin--are referred to as known, for the purpose of establishing\nthe vidhi, 'That it is which we must search out.'--The passage, 'He there\nwanders about,' &c., is a vidhi; for it teaches what is not already known from\nelsewhere.--The mentioning of such qualities as omniscience and omnipotence is\nvyapade _s_ a, i.e. simple expression of something known without reference to\na vidhi.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 6](sbe38323.htm)\n\n"
