They bring him a chariot, (or) a horse, or an elephant.\n\n2. 2 'Thou art the (Saman called) Rathantara; thou art the Vamadevya; thou art the B _ri_ hat;' the (verse), 'The two A\xe1\xb9\x85kas, the two Nya\xe1\xb9\x85kas' (Taitt. Sa _m_ hita I, 7, 7, 2); (the verse), 'May this your chariot, O A _s_ vins, not suffer damage, neither in pain nor in joy. May it make its way without damage, dispersing those who infest us;' (and the formula), 'Here is holding, here is keeping asunder; here is enjoyment, here may it enjoy itself:' with (these texts) he ascends the chariot, if he enters (the village) on a chariot.\n\n3. 3 'A horse art thou, a steed art thou'\xc2\x97with these eleven 'horses\xc2\x92 names' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. VII, 1, 12) (he mounts) the horse, if (he intends to enter the village) on horseback.\n\n4. 4 With (the formula), 'With Indra's thunderbolt I bestride thee; carry (me); carry the time; carry me forward to bliss. An elephant art thou. The elephant's glory art thou. The elephant's splendour art thou. May I become endowed with the elephant's glory, with the elephant's splendour'\xc2\x97(he mounts) the elephant, if (he intends to proceed to the village) on it.\n\np. 171\n\n5. 5 He goes to a place where they will do honour to him.\n\n6\\. With (the verse), 'May the quarters (of the horizon) stream together with\nme; may all delight assemble (here). May all wishes that are dear to us, come\nnear unto us; may (our) dear (wishes) stream towards us'\xc2\x97he worships the\nquarters of the horizon.\n\n7\\. While approaching the person who is going to do honour to him, he looks at\nhim with (the words), 'Glory art thou; may I become glory with thee.'\n\n8\\. Then (the host who is going to offer the Argha reception to the Snataka),\nhaving prepared the dwelling-place (for his reception), says to him, 'The\nArgha (will be offered)!'\n\n9\\. (The guest) replies, 'Do so!'\n\n10. 10 They prepare for him (the Madhuparka or 'honey mixture') consisting of three or of five substances.\n\n11\\. The three substances are, curds, honey, and ghee.\n\n12\\. The five substances are, curds, honey, ghee, water, and ground grains.\n\n13\\. Having poured curds into a brass vessel, he pours honey into it, (and\nthen the other substances stated above).\n\n14. 14 Having poured (those substances) into a smaller vessel, and having covered it with a larger (cover than the vessel is), (the host) makes (the guest) accept (the following things) separately, one after the other, viz. a bunch of grass (to sit down on),\n\np. 172\n\nwater for washing the feet, the Argha water, water for sipping, and the honey-\nmixture (Madhuparka).\n\n15. 15 Going after (the single objects which are brought to the guest, the host) in a faultless, not faltering (?) voice, announces (each of those objects to the guest).\n\n16\\. The bunch of grass (he announces by three times saying), 'The bunch of\ngrass!'\n\n17. 17 (The guest) sits down thereon facing the east, with (the formula), 'A giver of royal power art thou, a teacher's seat; may I not withdraw from thee.'\n\n18\\. (The host) then utters to him the announcement, 'The water for washing\nthe feet!'\n\n19. 19 With that (water) a _S_ udra or a _S_ udra woman washes his feet; the left foot first for a Brahma _n_ a, the right for a person of the two other castes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[170:2](sbe30055.htm#fr_562) 12, 2. Comp. Paraskara III, 14, 3-6.\n\n[170:3](sbe30055.htm#fr_563) In this Sutra three 'horses\xc2\x92 names' are given as\nthe Pratika of the Ya _g_ us quoted, 'Thou art a _s_ va, thou art haya, thou\nart maya.' Mat _ri_ datta observes that the third of them is not found in the\nTaittiriya Sa _m_ hita, which gives only ten, and not eleven, horses\xc2\x92 names.\n\n[170:4](sbe30055.htm#fr_564) Paraskara III, 15, 1 seq.\n\n[171:5](sbe30055.htm#fr_565) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana III, 9, 3; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana III, 1,\n14.\n\n[171:10](sbe30055.htm#fr_566) 10 seq.
