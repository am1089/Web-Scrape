On account of (the passage showing) respect, there is non-omission (of\nthe pra _n_ agnihotra) (even when the eating of food is omitted).\n\nWe read in the _Kh_ andogya under the heading of the Vai _s_ vanara-vidya,\n\'Therefore the first food which comes is in the place of Homa. And he who\noffers that first oblation should offer it to Pra _n_ a, saying Svaha\' (Kh.,\nUp. V, 19, i). The text thereupon enjoins five oblations, and later on applies\nto them the term \'Agnihotra;\' \'He who thus knowing this offers the agnihotra,\'\nand \'As hungry children here on earth sit round their mother, so do all beings\nsit round the agnihotra\' (V, 24, 2; 4).\n\nHere the doubt arises whether the agnihotra offered to the pra _n_ as is to be\nomitted when the eating itself is omitted or not.--As, according to the\nclause, \'The first food which comes,\' &c., the oblation is connected with the\ncoming of food, and as the coming of food subserves the eating, the agnihotra\noffered to the pra _n_ as is omitted when the eating is omitted.--Against this\nconclusion the Sutra (embodying the purvapaksha) declares, \'It is not omitted.\n--Why?--\'On account of the respect.\' This means: In their version of the Vai\n_s_ vanara-vidya the _G_ abalas read as follows: \'He (i.e. the host) is to eat\nbefore his guests; for (if he would make them eat first) it would be as if he\nwithout having himself offered the agnihotra offered that of another person.\'\nThis passage, which objects to the priority of the eating on the part of the\nguests and establishes priority on the part of the host, thereby intimates\nrespect for the agnihotra offered to the pra _n_ as. For as it does not allow\nthe omission of priority it will allow all the less the omission of that which\nis characterised by priority, viz. the agnihotra offered to the pra _n_ as.--\nBut (as mentioned above) the connexion--established by the _Kh_ andogya-\npassage--of the oblation with the coining of food--which subserves the eating\n--establishes the omission of the oblation\n\np. 250\n\nin the case of the eating being omitted!--Not so, the purvapakshin replies.\nThe purpose of that passage is to enjoin some particular material (to be\noffered). For the fundamental agnihotra certain materials, such as milk and so\non, are exclusively prescribed. Now, as through the term \'agnihotra\' (which\nthe text applies to the offering to the pra _n_ as) all the particulars\nbelonging to the fundamental agnihotra are already established for the\nsecondary agnihotra also (viz. the oblation made to the pra _n_ as), just as\nin the case of the ayana of the Ku _n_ _d_ apayins 1; the clause, \'the first\nfood which comes,\' &c., is meant to enjoin, for the pra _n_ agnihotra, some\nparticular secondary matter, viz. the circumstance of food constituting the\nmaterial of the oblation 2. Hence, considering the Mima _m_ sa principle that\nthe omission of a secondary matter does not involve the omission of the\nprincipal matter, we conclude that even in the case of the omission of eating,\nthe agnihotra offered to the pra _n_ as has to be performed by means of water\nor some other not altogether unsuitable material, according to the Mima _m_ sa\nprinciple that in the absence of the prescribed material some other suitable\nmaterial may be substituted.\n\nTo this purvapaksha the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[250:1](sbe38183.htm#fr_157) For one of the great sacrifices lasting a whole\nyear--called the ayana of the Ku _n_ _d_ apayins--the texts enjoin the\noffering of the \'agnihotra\' during a full month (cp. e.g. "Ta _n_ _d_ ya\nMahabrahma _n_ a XXV, 4). Now from the term \'agnihotra\' we conclude that all\nthe details of the ordinary agnihotra are valid for the agnihotra of the ayana\nalso.\n\n[250:2](sbe38183.htm#fr_158) Whereby the materials offered in the ordinary\nagnihotra are superseded.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 41](sbe38184.htm)\n\n'
