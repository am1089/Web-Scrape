Moreover they (the _G_ abalas) speak of him\n\np. 153\n\n(the highest Lord) in that (i.e. the interstice between the top of the head\nand the chin which is measured by a span).\n\nMoreover the _G_ abalas speak in their text of the highest Lord as being in\nthe interstice between the top of the head and the chin. 'The unevolved\ninfinite Self abides in the avimukta (i.e. the non-released soul). Where does\nthat avimukta abide? It abides in the Vara _n_ a and the Nasi, in the middle.\nWhat is that Vara _n_ a, what is that Nasi?' The text thereupon etymologises\nthe term Vara _n_ a as that which wards off (varayati) all evil done by the\nsenses, and the term Nasi as that which destroys (na _s_ ayati) all evil done\nby the senses; and then continues, 'And what is its place?--The place where\nthe eyebrows and the nose join. That is the joining place of the heavenly\nworld (represented by the upper part of the head) and of the other (i.e. the\nearthly world represented by the chin).' ( _G_ abala Up. I.)--Thus it appears\nthat the scriptural statement which ascribes to the highest Lord the measure\nof a span is appropriate. That the highest Lord is called abhivimana refers to\nhis being the inward Self of all. As such he is directly measured, i.e. known\nby all animate beings. Or else the word may be explained as 'he who is near\neverywhere--as the inward Self--and who at the same time is measureless' (as\nbeing infinite). Or else it may denote the highest Lord as him who, as the\ncause of the world, measures it out, i.e. creates it. By all this it is proved\nthat Vai _s_ vanara is the highest Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 1](sbe34070.htm)\n\n"
