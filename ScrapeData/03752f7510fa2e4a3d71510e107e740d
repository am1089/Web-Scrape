There is a reddish-white (he-goat as the victim) for the A _s_ vins\n1, for the A _s_ vins are reddish-white. There is an ewe with teats in the\ndewlap 2 for Sarasvati; and a bull he seizes for Indra Sutraman (the good\nprotector) 3. Difficult to obtain are beasts with such perfections; if he\ncannot obtain any\n\np. 130\n\nwith such perfections, they may slaughter only goats, for they are easier to\ncook. And if they seize only goats, that for the A _s_ vins is a red one. Then\nas to why he performs this sacrifice.\n\n5:5:4:22\\. Now Tvash _t_ _ri_ had a three-headed, six-eyed son 1. He had three\nmouths; and because he was thus shapen, he was called Vi _s_ varupa ('All-\nshape').\n\n5:5:4:33\\. One of his mouths was Soma-drinking, one spirit-drinking, and one\nfor other food. Indra hated him, and cut off those heads of his.\n\n5:5:4:44\\. And from the one which was Soma-drinking, a hazel-cock sprang\nforth; whence the latter is of brownish colour, for king Soma is brown.\n\n5:5:4:55\\. And from the one which was spirit-drinking, a sparrow sprang;\nwhence the latter talks like one who is joyful, for when one has drunk\nspirits, one talks as one who enjoys himself.\n\n5:5:4:66\\. And from the one which was for other (kinds of) food, a partridge\nsprang; whence the latter is exceedingly variegated: ghee drops indeed have,\nas it were, dropped on his wings in one place, and honey-drops, as it were, in\nanother; for suchlike was the-food he consumed with that (mouth).\n\n5:5:4:77\\. Tvash _t_ _ri_ was furious: 'Has he really slain my son?' He\nbrought Soma juice withheld from Indra 2; and as that Soma-juice was, when\nproduced, even so it remained withheld from Indra.\n\np. 131\n\n5:5:4:88\\. Indra thought within himself: 'There now, they are excluding me\nfrom Soma!' and even uninvited he consumed what pure (Soma) there was in the\ntub, as the stronger (would consume the food) of the weaker. But it hurt him:\nit flowed in all directions from (the openings of) his vital airs; only from\nhis mouth it did not flow. Hence there was an atonement; but had it flown also\nfrom his mouth, then indeed there would have been no atonement.\n\n5:5:4:99\\. For there are four castes, the Brahma _n_ a, the Ra _g_ anya, the\nVai _s_ ya, and the _S_ udra; but there is not one of them that vomits Soma;\nbut were there any one of them, then indeed there would be atonement.\n\n5:5:4:1010\\. From what flowed from the nose a lion sprang; and from what\nflowed from the ears a wolf sprang; and from what flowed from the lower\nopening wild beasts sprang, with the tiger as their foremost; and what flowed\nfrom the upper opening that was the foaming spirit (parisrut). And thrice he\nspit out: thence were produced the (fruits called) 'kuvala, karkandhu, or\nbadara 1.' He (Indra) became emptied out of everything, for Soma is\neverything.\n\n5:5:4:1111\\. Being thus purged by Soma, he walked about as one tottering. The\nA _s_ vins cured him by this (offering), and caused him to be supplied with\neverything, for Soma is everything. By offering he indeed became better.\n\n5:5:4:1212\\. The gods spake, 'Aha! these two have saved him 2, the well-saved\n(sutrata):' hence the name Sautrama _n_ i.\n\np. 132\n\n5:5:4:1313\\. Let him also cure by this (ceremony) one purged by Soma;--he whom\nSoma purges is indeed emptied out of everything, for Soma is everything. He\nnow causes him to be supplied with everything, for Soma is everything; and by\noffering he indeed becomes better: let him therefore cure thereby also one\npurged by Soma.\n\n5:5:4:1414\\. And as to why the performer of the Ra _g_ asuya performs this\noffering. He who performs the Ra _g_ asuya assuredly gains for himself all\nsacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and instituted\nby the gods indeed is this offering, the Sautrama _n_ i: 'May offering be made\nby me with this one also! may I be consecrated by this one also!' thus (he\nthinks, and) therefore the performer of the Ra _g_ asuya performs this\noffering.\n\n5:5:4:1515\\. And as to why there is (a victim) for the A _s_ vins,--it was the\nA _s_ vins who cured him; and in like manner does he (the priest) now cure him\nthrough those same A _s_ vins: that is why there is (a victim) for the A _s_\nvins.\n\n5:5:4:1616\\. And why there is one for Sarasvati,--Sarasvati assuredly is\nspeech, and it was by speech that the A _s_ vins cured him; and in like manner\ndoes he now cure him by speech: that is why there is one for Sarasvati.\n\n5:5:4:1717\\. And why there is one for Indra,--Indra assuredly is the deity of\nthe sacrifice, and it is by this (offering) that he now heals him: this is why\nthere is one for Indra.\n\n5:5:4:1818\\. On (the meat-portions of) those victims he throws hairs of a\nlion, hairs of a wolf, and hairs of a tiger, for that was what sprang\ntherefrom, when Soma flowed right through him. He now supplies\n\np. 133\n\nhim therewith, and makes him whole: therefore he throws those (hairs) thereon.\n\n5:5:4:1919\\. But let him not do it so; for he who throws them on the (portions\nof) the victims, urges the animals on from behind with a clawed (prickly)\nfire-brand. Let him therefore rather throw them into the fermented liquor\n(parisrut 1),--thus he does not urge on the animals from behind with a clawed\nfire-brand; and thus alone he supplies him therewith, and makes him whole: let\nhim therefore throw it rather into the spirituous liquor.\n\n5:5:4:2020\\. Now on the day before, he mixes the spirituous liquor (while\nmuttering, Va _g_. S. X, 30, 'Get done for the A _s_ vins! get done for\nSarasvati! get done for Indra, the good protector!' When that liquor is (done)\nhe proceeds with that (offering).\n\n5:5:4:2121\\. They take up two fires; on the northern altar 2 (they lay down)\nthe northern (fire), and on a raised (mound) the southern one, thinking, 'Lest\nwe should offer together the Soma-libations, and the Sura (liquor)\n-libations:' therefore they take up two fires, and on the northern altar (they\nlay down) the northern (fire), and on a raised (mound) the southern one. And\nwhen he proceeds with the omenta, then he proceeds with that spirituous\nliquor.\n\n5:5:4:2222\\. He purifies it with stalks of Darbha-grass, thinking, 'Let it be\npure,'--with (Va _g_. S. X, 31), 'The inviting 3 Soma, purified by the\npurifying\n\np. 134\n\n[paragraph continues] (strainer), has overflown backwards, Indra's mated\nfriend.' He then pours in flour of 'kuvala, karkandhu, and badara' berries,\nfor when he (Indra) spit out thrice, that was what was produced therefrom:\ntherewith he now supplies him and makes him whole,--therefore he pours in that\n(flour).\n\n5:5:4:2323\\. He then draws either one or three cups 1,--but only one should be\ndrawn, for there is one puroru _k_ -formula, one invitatory prayer, and one\noffering prayer; therefore only one (cup) should be drawn.\n\n5:5:4:2424\\. He draws it with (Va _g_. S. X, 32), 'Yea, even as the owners of\nbarley cut their barley, spreading it asunder in due order, so hither, hither,\nbring thou the nourishments of them that offer up the devotional invocation of\nthe Barhis 2!--Thou art taken with a support--thee for the A _s_ vins, thee\nfor Sarasvati, thee for Indra, the good protector!' And if he draw three\n(cups), let him draw them with that same (verse); but let him in that case\ndraw them with separate 'supports 3.' He then says, 'Recite the\n\np. 135\n\ninvitatory prayer to the A _s_ vins, to Sarasvati, and to Indra Sutraman!'\n\n5:5:4:2525\\. He recites (Va _g_. S. X, 33; _Ri_ k S. X, 131, 4), 'Ye, O A _s_\nvins, lords of splendour, having quaffed the cheering (Soma) together with\nNamu _k_ i, the \xc3\x82sura, helped Indra in his deeds!' Having called for the [_S_\nrausha _t_](errata.htm#11), he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to the A\n_s_ vins, to Sarasvati, and to Indra Sutraman!'\n\n5:5:4:2626\\. He prays (Va _g_. S. X, 34; _Ri_ k S. X, 131, 5), 'As the parents\n(stand by) their son, so the two A _s_ vins have stood by thee, O Indra, with\nwise plans and wonderful deeds; when thou quaffedst the cheering (Soma),\nSarasvati cured thee, O Lord, by her services.' Twice the Hot _ri_ utters the\nVasha _t_ , twice the Adhvaryu offers and fetches drink. And if he draw three\n(cups of liquor), then after the offering of that one the other two are\noffered.\n\n5:5:4:2727\\. Now there is a pitcher perforated either with a hundred, or with\nnine, holes. If it is one with a hundred holes,--man lives up to a hundred\n(years), and has a hundred energies, and a hundred powers: therefore it is\nperforated with a hundred holes. And if with nine holes,--there are in man\nthose nine vital airs: therefore it is perforated with nine holes.\n\n5:5:4:2828\\. This (pitcher), hung up by a sling, they hold just over the\n\xc3\x82havaniya 1. He pours into it what spirituous liquor has been left over, and\nwhilst it is\n\np. 136\n\ntrickling through, he stands by worshipping with the three verses 1 of the\nPitara _h_ Somavanta _h_ (the Fathers accompanied by Soma), with three verses\nof the Pitaro Barishada _h_ (the Fathers seated on the barhis), and with three\nverses of the Pitaro Agnishvatta _h_ (the Fathers consumed by the fire). And\nas to why he thus stands by worshipping,--when Soma flowed through Indra, what\npart of it then went to the Fathers--there being three kinds of Fathers--\ntherewith he now supplies him and makes him whole: therefore he thus stands by\nworshipping.\n\n5:5:4:2929\\. He then prepares those oblations 2,--a cake on twelve or eight\npotsherds for Savit _ri_ , a barley pap for Varu _n_ a, and a cake on eleven\npotsherds for Indra.\n\n5:5:4:3030\\. And why there is one for Savit _ri_ ,--Savit _ri_ is the impeller\nof the gods, and impelled by Savit _ri_ he now heals 3: therefore there is one\nfor Savit _ri_.\n\np. 137\n\n5:5:4:3131\\. And why there is one for Varu _n_ a,--Varu _n_ a is the injurer,\nand he thus heals him even by him who is the injurer: therefore there is one\nfor Varu _n_ a.\n\n5:5:4:3232\\. And why there is one for Indra,--Indra is the deity of the\nsacrifice, and he thus heals him by him who is the deity of the sacrifice:\ntherefore there is one for Indra.\n\n5:5:4:3333\\. And if by that (Sautrama _n_ i-offering) he would heal one purged\nby Soma 1, then--(after) the after-offering (of the animal sacrifice) has been\nperformed, and the two spoons separated--he proceeds with those (three)\noblations 2. For it is towards the back part that Soma flows through, and at\nthe back part (of the sacrifice) he thus closes him up by that sacrificial\nessence. Let him in that case prepare a cake on two potsherds for the A _s_\nvins; and when he proceeds with the offering of the omenta, then he also\nproceeds with that two-kapala cake for the A _s_ vins.\n\n5:5:4:3434\\. Let him, however, not do it in this way; for verily whosoever\ndeparts from the path of the sacrifice stumbles, and he who does this indeed\ndeparts from the path of the sacrifice. Hence at the very time when they\nproceed with the omenta of those victims, let them then proceed also with\nthose (three) oblations, and let him not then prepare a two-kapala cake for\nthe A _s_ vins.\n\n5:5:4:3535\\. A castrated bull is the sacrificial fee for this\n\np. 138\n\n[paragraph continues] (sacrifice);--the castrated bull is neither female nor\nmale; for being a male it is not a female, and being a female (unmanned) it is\nnot a male: therefore a castrated bull is the fee. Or a draught-mare;--the\ndraught-mare is neither male nor female; for in that it pulls the cart it is\nnot a female; and being a female, it is not a male: therefore a draught-mare\n(may be) the fee.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[129:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_254) The last three Soma-sacrifices of the\nInauguration-ceremony are not even alluded to by the author, their performance\ninvolving no features different from those of the normal Soma-sacrifice. The\nVyush _t_ i-dviratra, or 'two nights' ceremony of the dawn,' consists of an\nAgnish _t_ oma and an Atiratra Soma-sacrifice, to be performed a month after\nthe Ke _s_ avapaniya (or, according to Taitt. Br. I, 8, 10, a fortnight after,\nviz. on the new-moon, and the first day of the light fortnight respectively).\nFinally, the Kshatra-dh _ri_ ti, or 'wielding of the ruling-power,' an Agnish\n_t_ oma, is performed a month later, or on the full-moon of _S_ rava _n_ a\n(about 1 August). Some authorities, however, allow the Soma-sacrifices of the\nInauguration-ceremony to conclude with the Ke _s_ avapaniya Atiratra (Katy.\n_S_ r. XV, 9, 26), perhaps for the very reason that no mention is made in the\nBrahma _n_ a of the remaining three Soma-days. The final Soma-sacrifice is\nfollowed, in the succeeding fortnight of the waxing moon, by the performance\nof the Sautrama _n_ i, some peculiar features of which the author now proceeds\nto consider. This ceremony (one of the objects of which is the expiation of\nany excess committed in the consumption of Soma-juice) is considered in the\nsacrificial system as the last of the seven forms of Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a; being\na combination of the ish _t_ i with the animal sacrifice. As this ceremony is\nalso performed after the Agni _k_ ayana, or construction of the fire-altar, it\nis more fully dealt with by the author later on (Ka _n_ _d_ a XII, 7 seq.).\n\n[129:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_255) Prof. R. Wallace's 'India in 1887' (plate 39)\ncontains a photographic representation of an Indian goat with pendicles like\nteats.\n\n[129:3](sbe4126.htm#fr_256) In the case of the 'somatipavita,' not the\n'somavamin,' the Taittiriyas slaughter a fourth victim to B _ri_ haspati.\n\n[130:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_257) This portion of the legend is but a repetition\nfrom I, 6, 3, 1 seq. A few alterations are, however, made here in the\ntranslation.\n\n[130:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_258) Or, 'Soma from which Indra was excluded'\n(apendra), as formerly translated; a closer rendering of the succeeding clause\nmaking this change desirable;--even as Indra was excluded from the Soma-juice\nwhen produced, so he remained excluded from it (when it was offered up).\n\n[131:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_259) The berries of three different species of the\nZizyphus jujuba, or jujube-tree.\n\n[131:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_260) The MS. of Saya _n_ a's commentary reads\n'atrasatam.'\n\n[133:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_261) On the preparation of the parisrut or sura, see\nXII, 7; Weber, Ind. Studien, X, p 349.\n\n[133:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_262) The two new fireplaces, to the east of the\n\xc3\x82havaniya, are to be constructed on the model of those of the Varu _n_\napraghasa _h_ , see part i, p. 392.\n\n[133:3](sbe4126.htm#fr_263) This doubtful interpretation of 'vayu' is adopted\nfrom the St. p. 134 Petersburg dictionary, where, however, it is only applied\nto two passages of the Rig-veda. Saya _n_ a here explains it by 'patra _n_ i\nga _k_ _kh_ an vayuva _k_ _kh_ igragami va bhutva pratya\xe1\xb9\x85 adhovarti\npatrabhimukha _h_ san.' In the Taitt. S. this verse is. preceded by another (\n_Ri_ k S. IX, 1, 6), 'May Surya's daughter purify thy foaming (parisrut) Soma\nwith the never-failing horse-tail (strainer).'\n\n[134:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_264) According to the ritual of the Taittiriyas, three\ncups of Sura are drawn.\n\n[134:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_265) _Ri_ k S. X, 131, 2, and Taitt. S. I, 8, 21\nread--'hither, hither bring the nourishments of them that have not gone to the\ndevotional up-pulling (cutting) of the barhis-grass' (but differently Saya _n_\na,--'that have not gone to the neglect of the devotion of the barhis').\n\n[134:3](sbe4126.htm#fr_266) That is to say, he is to repeat the formula, 'Thou\nart taken p. 135 with a support,' each time followed by a special dedication,\n'thee for the A _s_ vins!' &c.\n\n[135:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_267) That is, over the southern one of the two new\nfires, the one laid down on a raised mound.\n\n[136:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_268) These triplets to the Fathers are given Va _g_. S.\nXIX, 49-51; 55-57; 58-60.--The Taitt. ritual here has a curious variation.\nAfter the remainder of the (pure) liquor has been offered to the Fathers, a\nBrahman is to be bought over to drink the dregs; and if such an one cannot be\nfound (willing to do it), they are to be poured away on an ant-hill. This is\nto be done for the sake of atonement.\n\n[136:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_269) That is, according to Katyayana (XV, 10, 19) and\nSaya _n_ a, the pa _s_ u-puro _d_ a _s_ a, or cakes of the animal offering.\nThe performance of these is irregular, inasmuch as their deities are not the\nsame as those of the animal sacrifice (the A _s_ vins, Sarasvati, and Indra\nSutraman). Taitt. Br. I, 8, 6, 1, however, explains that in this case the\nanimal sacrifices are without 'animal cakes,' the libations of liquor, which\nindeed are offered to the same deities, being in lieu of them.\n\n[136:3](sbe4126.htm#fr_270) The object of the Sautrama _n_ i offering is to\nheal or 'make whole' the Sacrificer.\n\n[137:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_271) That is to say, if it is performed, independently\nof the Ra _g_ asuya, as a special offering with a view to expiating any excess\ncommitted at a Soma-sacrifice.\n\n[137:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_272) A glance at the list of contents prefixed to part\nii will show how this shifting of the Pa _s_ u-puro _d_ a _s_ a would alter\nthe regular order of procedure.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 5, 5.
