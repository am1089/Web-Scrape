Let me learn that Jnana (Wisdom), which is\nthe basis of everything, that it, may arise in me to its .fullest power."\n\nThe Rishi Vashisht replied: "King Sikhithwaya was born in the Dwapara Yuga **.\nOver his people he ruled wisely and well. His justice had no bond by-ways. He\nhad but one purpose--to do good and perform the works of virtue. Master over\nbody and mind, his great joy lay in the happiness of his Subjects.\n\n"Chundalai, his Queenly Consort, born through Tapas (Meditation), to the Queen\nof\n\np. 64\n\nthe Sourashtra country was like a peacock in beauty. Her beauty glowed like a\njewel in the perfect setting of her sterling virtue.\n\n\n\n"This King and Queen lived together in perfect happiness, fulfilling their\nduties without the slightest difference of opinion. Their youth passed\ndelightfully, united in body and mind, and their days flowed away like water\nfrom a broken jar, and middle age hovered over them like clouds on a rainy\nday. They had tasted the passion fruit of worldly things. In their youth they\nloved this and desired that, but now materiality fell from them like an worn-\nout garment: The only desire left was to obtain Adhyatmic-Jnana (wisdom of the\nself), for this wisdom is the only certain ending of the disease of rebirth.\n\n"Realizing there is no escape from the disease of rebirth, except through\nAtma-Jnan (self-wisdom), they started toward the attainment of\n\np. 65\n\nthis goal with minds fixed in true meditation. About them were gathered the\nWise and Learned of their time. In this environment of Harmony and Peace, they\ncollected a store of Wisdom, and led a truly spiritual life.\n\n"Queen Chundalai, she of true discernment, having heard and understood well\nthe real significance of the Sastra (Wisdom) taught by the Wise, for the\nattainment of the Higher spirituality, said to herself--since there exists\nAtma as I fully realize, why do we use the term "I"? From whence comes this\nillusion to the mind; to what is it due; how does it arise? The body is not\nthe "I", as the body is visible to us, and is changeable and incomplete in\nitself. Nor can it designate the organs functioning in the body, nor its\nmoving force Prana. Further, it does not describe the mind which owes its\nactivity to thought. The term Jiva cannot be applied to the "I", as the Jiva\nis the individual soul. I have learned through this enquiry that Atma-jnana\n(Wisdom of the self) will never be attained through the senses, but through\nthe Eternal Jnana (Wisdom). I know my Jiva exists through Atmic reality. This\nAtmic Wisdom become known only by knowing oneself, not through\n\np. 66\n\nanother. This self-wisdom or self light shines everywhere.\n\n"By divine realization the Queen enjoyed the consciousness of the reality of\nthe Atma self, and discharged her daily duties without desire for their\nfruits. Longing ceased, and the inclination of her mind toward the pairs of\nopposites, love and hate, cold and heat. She became the receptacle of Bliss as\na result of the control of her mind. Then with the daily Yoga practices, the\nQueen developed Atmic reality, that true realization, which is a certainty\nbeyond explanation. Only he knows it, who has realized the reality. The\nbeautiful Queen shone with a radiant Spiritual Light.\n\n"The King noted the refulgence of his wife\'s beauty with great pleasure. He\nasked his Queen, \'O Beloved One, you are now radiant with such great beauty,\nit is as if your youth had come back again, or as if you had sipped a divine\nnectar by which you have attained Eternal Divine beauty. You seem so happy,\nyour mind so blessed with divine peace, that you are perfect in body and mind.\nTell me, my Queen, of the wonderous purity which so dazzles me.\'\n\np. 67\n\n"Queen Chundalai replied: \'Having abandoned and risen above this world which\nis form but formless, real but without reality, I attained the Mighty One, who\nis the reality beyond the older age or death. Hence, the radiance in my body,\nwhich is but the reflection of the refulgent peace within. I have realized\nThat God which is the essential nature of all; being the atom of atoms; the\nwhole, without creation or destruction. That is why my body is radiant. I have\nno joy in the object of the senses, yet do I partake of the Bliss and\nhappiness of beauty. Love and hate have both gone from me, and every hour I\nglory in the attainment of physical beauty and contentment, but the objects my\neyes and mind behold awake no response in me, either of joy or sorrow. I have\nattained the super-consciousness, which is the cause of my Bliss and beauty.\'\n\n"Hearing the explanation from his wife, the King without understanding or\ntrying to understand her words, said: \'O Beloved, thou hast given utterance to\nwords which are not befitting thee. Hast thou lost thy mental balance? How is\nit that thou, living in palaces and in\n\np. 68\n\nthe luxuries of wealth, should attain the realization of Atma when the\ngreatest of men have cut themselves off from the outward world and have sought\nthe quiet retreats of the Himalaya Mountains, in order to attain that state of\nBliss, or Atma?\n\n"\'How can a Queen, like you, realize that which can only be realised by the\nWise? Thou mayest say that thou hast enjoyed that blessed state, like those\nwho were unable to reach that exalted state, but claimed they had sensed it,\nintuitionally, within. Tell me, how canst thou realise the Atma within? Thou\nwho art a poor fragile creature, without Wisdom, tossed to and fro by the\nsenses.\'\n\n"The Queen was touched by the King\'s remarks. She pitied the poor King, who\nhad not reached that state in which he could understand or enjoy the Divine\nBliss. Still the King and Queen lived together in Peace and Harmony as they\nhad done in the past. The Queen had gained perfect control over her mind and\ndesires. She thought if she were able too develop the power of levitation,\nthen it would be easy to convince her King of her power. For this purpose\n\np. 69\n\nshe practised Madras in Yoga for the attainment of levitation."\n\nRam said to the Master: "Please explain how one may attain such psychic power\nas levitation, etc."\n\nThe Master answered: "I am telling you the interesting story of the Queen, and\nnow thou dost ask an explanation of Yoga. However, I will answer thee. By\ncontrol of Prana (Vital or Life Force), one may attain that power. One who\nwishes to attain that power should have a balanced diet: should practice\nMudras and Postures. Control of the mind is also necessary as well as the\nstudy and ceaseless practice of Yoga. One should have the help of a Spiritual\nTeacher. One should be free from anger, love and hate. Try to understand the\nnature of Prana (Vital or Life Force) and control its movements, then you can\nMaster the forces of nature, Sidhi (psychic), and attain liberation.\n\n"There is in the midst of the one hundred Nadis (big vein or nerve), one which\nis called Kundalini, it is within every being from Brahma to worm. It is like\na serpent, and is sleeping as the serpent sleeps in the winter. When the\nKundalini\n\np. 70\n\npower is aroused, it enables one to master the powers of nature. All other\nNadis of the body are connected with the Kundalini. The powers of the\nKundalini become useful, through the Light of Wisdom. This power, through\nmeditation becomes meditation, through wisdom becomes wisdom, mind through\nmind, thought through thought, egoism through egoism.\n\n"This greatest of all powers may easily be controlled, if one masters the\nPrana. The Prana (Vital or life force) always goes upward, the Apana, (or\nother vital force) always goes downward. These two vital or life forces cause\ndeath of the body. If Prana is brought down, and Apana be permitted to rise\nand mix in the heart, then disease would leave the body, never to return."\n\nRam again said to the Master: "Please explain how mental disease can be\ndestroyed."\n\nThe Master answered: "Diseases which affect the mind are the first and are not\nthe easiest to heal; those which affect the body may be classed as secondary.\nThe desires which affect the mind are primary diseases; we have sunk thus\n\np. 71\n\nfar by absence of Wisdom, and lack of Mastery over ourselves. We are under the\nseeming power of delusion. We cannot realise to what extent we arc pulled down\nby such delusion. The mental disease is similar to the coming of a winter\nstorm. When the power of desires gets hold of one, he then is liable to be\nguilty of fearful karma (wrong action); this in turn produces bodily disease.\n\n"Bodily disease is also brought on by overeating, living in unhealthy places,\nassociation with the wicked, impure desires, evil thoughts, etc. These mental\nor indirect diseases have a direct effect upon the body.\n\n"Now I will explain how both forms of disease perish, O Ram. The wise say that\nthe mental diseases have two divisions, common and specific, the former affect\nthis body only, but the latter tend to rebirth, also. The common diseases may\nbe banished by correct eating and right thinking.\n\n"When the mind is not in perfect harmony it may affect the blood and produce\ndiscord in any portion of the body. Mental discord will produce poison in the\nblood, and the poison will\n\np. 72\n\naffect the nervous system. When the nervous system is affected, then Prana\n(Vital Force) cannot follow its right path. When Prana does not follow its\nright path, then it cannot reach all parts of the body as it should, and thus\nmany of the nerves may wither or die. If harmony is established in the mind,\nall else is easy and simple. When harmony is established in the mind, it will\nnaturally follow, that one will want to do good and read good books pertaining\nto truth. When peace is established in the mind, then Prana will follow its\nright course and all disease will vanish.\n\n"The path of Yoga, by which one may master the power of the Kundalini, is\nthrough the practise of Pranayama, which causes the power of the Kundalini to\narise, and then the holy becomes strong. By Pranayama the movement of Prana\nand Apana may be controlled; then the Yogin will be able to go up like a bird.\nThe Prana is the cause, and when it is made to go up through the Sushumna, all\nkinds of psychic powers are attained, such as seeing, hearing and levitation."\n\nRam again questioned Rishi Vashisht; "How\n\np. 73\n\ndo such people become light and heavy, seemingly at will, and how do they gain\ncontrol over the powers of nature?"\n\nThe Master replied: "Such powers are mastered only by one who has a\nconsciousness of absolute purity, free from the worldly things. The self is\nfinest of the fine, which is not the Universe, neither its association with\nit. But through its own thoughts becomes individual soul, and is known by the\nname Jiva (individual soul). This Jiva mingles with many things in the world,\nforgets its reality and thinks of the body as being real. When one has the\nlast awakening or illumination and determines to know the Absolute Reality,\nthen the gross and unreal vanish and the real nature comes to light, and is\nrevealed or manifested. Through meditation the psychic powers are awakened and\nmastered. This is the truth revealed to those who have gained mastery through\nYoga.\n\n"Through Yoga means, the Queen mastered the psychic powers, and with it\nencircled the world, simply to convince her King. No one\n\np. 74\n\nknew that the Queen possessed such marvelous power. That was one reason her\nKing did not believe or gain the state of Bliss. For the King was as ignorant\nof her blessed power, as a child is ignorant of higher education. The King was\nwithout peace of mind, so this great Yogin did not try to raise the King to\nAtmic Wisdom."\n\nRam then said: "O Master, how can others hope to attain pure Wisdom when the\ngreat King failed, when his wife, the great Yogin, tried to help him realise\nthe blessed Wisdom? Speak, O Master, and say which is the right means to\nattain the goal?"\n\nRishi Vashisht answered: "Faith in the word of the Guru (Spiritual Teacher) is\nthe way, but discipleship alone is the means of reaching Atmic Wisdom."\n\nRam said: "If the disciple alone is the means of reaching the Atmic Wisdom,\nthen why should it be necessary to have faith in the word of the Guru?"\n\nThe Master explained: "A certain hunter, who lived in the mountains, lost a\nshell while walking along through the grassy forest; he was greatly worried\nabout the lost shell and\n\np. 75\n\nwent searching for it. After a long search he came upon a gem shining like a\nmoon. Searching for his shell led to the finding of a precious gem. Such may\nbe the experience of the disciple, in looking for the Guru (Spiritual\nteacher), he may find true Wisdom. Studying with the Guru will help, but the\ndiscipleship is the means of developing Atmic Wisdom.\n\n"The King without true wisdom tried many means of attaining self wisdom, but\nhe was working under illusion, as he thought lie would gain by giving gifts,\nbathing in Holy Water and observance of religious laws. These did not set him\nfree from his mental suffering. At last he turned to his Queen and said: \'I am\ngiving up everything in this world, but, I have one desire,--to go to the\nforest and live there a peaceful life, as delusion of wealth or pain do not\nhunt there. The bliss that is the highest attainable is in the forest; so let\nme go.\'\n\n"The Queen said, \'everything will be ready and ripe at the time, I pray thee\ndo not go?\'\n\n"The King said: \'Do not interfere with my plans. You are young, and shalt rule\nin my place, as it is the wife\'s duty not to languish at the absence\n\np. 76\n\nof her husband, but to protect those who are near her.\'\n\n"The King gave an order that the city should be patrolled that night, that\nevery one should remain at home, within the house. That night the King made\nhis way to the forest. After walking for two weeks he reached a spot in the\nMandara Hills, which are surrounded by beautiful pools and wild flowers. He\nmade a hut of leaves, a cloth bag for fruit, and a place for meditation. Then\nhe started his practice; the first hour, for religious rites, the second and\nthird, gathering flowers for Gods\'s worship, fourth, eating fruits; at night,\nchanting Mantras, thus the King did his tapasa.\n\n"Next morning the Queen found the King had gone to the woods, leaving behind\nhis Kingdom, wealth and Queen. She pitied the poor King, and wanted to know\nwhere he had gone, so she levitated and roamed in the sky. She appeared to\nSidhas (psychic persons), as beautiful as the shining moon. She saw her\nhusband in the forest, meditated upon what she should do, and reached the\nconclusion she would not disturb him. She thought it would be better to let\nhim\n\np. 77\n\nmaster himself; so she returned to her palace without letting him see her.\n\n"The Master Yogin issued a proclamation to her people, stating that her\nhusband was away on a secret mission. For eight years she ruled with royal\ngrace of equal justice to all, while the poor King suffered a life of\nprivation and penance in the forest.\n\n"Realizing that the time had come for her to again see her husband, she went\nforth one night through the air. She alighted on a near by hill, where she saw\na decrepit and care worn, old man, whom at first she did not recognize as her\nhusband. But her clear vision soon discovered that it was indeed he, and she\ncried out with her grief, to see, through dire ignorance, the King bent,\ngroaning in pain. The Queen thought, I have power to confer Atmic Wisdom on\nhim at this moment, but he will reject me as his young wife, so I shall not\nappear before him in this form. I shall change to [another](errata.htm#4) form\nto accomplish my purpose. As his mind is now ripe for Atmic Wisdom, a single\nword from me will show him the way to that blessed state, at this time. At\nthis hour a rare opportunity was at\n\np. 78\n\nhand. She changed her form from woman to man by the power of Samayan (the\nSamayan is the highest power of the Raja Yogin), and [descended](errata.htm#5)\nfrom the sky before the King. The King saw the form of a young Brahman\nstanding in the air before him.\n\n"The King paid due respect to him, and asked him to be seated. The young\nBrahman returned due respect to Raja Rishi (the King), of true Tapas (prayer,\nmeditation etc.).\n\n"The King said: \'By thy gracious visit I am greatly benefited, as thou art my\nGuru.\'\n\n"The young Brahman replied: \'Who in this world has such great qualities as you\npossess? May you live long. May your mind be filled with Divine Peace and be\nfree from all delusion of the world.\n\n"\'You are performing very high Tapas, as you have given up everything for the\nsake of liberation. You are performing Tapas as trying, as meeting the point\nof the sword.\'\n\n"The King said: \'Thou being a God, art well aware of my condition. May I ask\nthy name, and who thou art?\'\n\np. 79\n\n"The young Brahman replied: \'I am the son of Rishi Narada, whose Atmic Wisdom\nshines like the sun. At my birth I was taken into the presence of Brahma\n(God), who paved my way to Atmic Wisdom. As I was His grandson, He named me\nKumbha Muni: my mother is Saraswati (Mother of Wisdom). I continually study\nthe Vedas (Book of Holy Wisdom).\'\n\n"The King believed every word of the Kumbha Muni. The Muni asked the King:\n\'What is thy name and what thy origin?\'\n\n"The King answered: \'From the pains of this world I came here for peace. My\nname is Sikhithwaya. I have given up my kingship as my mind was always binding\nme to the cycle of rebirth. I try my best to free myself from pains, but they\nare increasing. O Muni, the milk has surely turned to poison.\'\n\n"Kumbha Muni then replied: \'O King, without a Guru (Spiritual Teacher), the\nbliss of Atmic Wisdom is not to be obtained; tapas and mantras are merely a\nwaste of time, O King. He who has not the Atmic Wisdom, but follows his duty\nof action is the best. Unselfish action will remove the impure desires; doing\ngood\n\np. 80\n\nkarma will bring about heavenly bliss, and pure desire does not make any fresh\nkarma, but the impure one does. If you know that all is Brahma, then ignorance\nis destroyed; the impure desires will never arise. If the impure desires are\ncontrolled, then old age and death are also controlled, and brings one to the\nhighest state of Brahma.\n\n"\'The mind associated with impure desires is ignorance itself, but free from\nimpure desires it is Wisdom itself. If through Wisdom, Soul realizes Reality,\nthen one is free from the chain of rebirth.\n\n"\'When all the wise, even Brahma, have said the attainment of Wisdom is the\nhighest bliss, why do you not try to attain it? Why do you not try to find\nwhence came this Universe? Why are you killing time here in ignorance? Why not\ntry to find a Guru and from him learn what is bondage and what, liberation? Go\nto those who have clear vision over all. They are the embodiment of wisdom.\nEngage ceaselessly in enquiring, then indeed you will find the real, the\nreality, which is the means of emancipation.\'\n\np. 81\n\n"The King cried with joy. \'O Guru, I have learned all this attainment of the\nway to bliss, and pure wisdom, by thy grace. I have left the company of the\nwise through ignorance, came to this forest to suffer, but now I am freed from\npain, by thy kindness. I believe it is thy duty, as thou art within the\nforest, to point the way to bliss. Thou art my friend, thou art my Guru, thou\nart my parent. I shall be steadfast as thy disciple. Please accept me as thy\ndisciple. Lead me in the path you have realized; you are equal to Brahma.\nTeach me the One-ness that sets people free from all pain, and into the\nconsciousness of blissful truth.\'\n\n"The Kumbha Muni said: \'I can teach you if you will concentrate your mind,\nwhich has been roaming, from place to place. Without concentration, my word\nwill not be of any help to you.\'\n\n"The King promised to believe and concentrate on the words of the Muni. The\nMuni said: \'First you should have full confidence in my words, as a child has\nin the words of his father. O King, hear what you will not understand; I will\nrelate again the hidden meaning. In the olden days there was a man of wealth\nand\n\np. 82\n\ngreat knowledge, but alas, he was without Atmic Wisdom. This man went in\nsearch of Chintamuni, a lucky stone that brings anything its owner wishes for.\nIn the days when he was searching to find the lucky stone, which was bright\nand shining as the moon, the man without understanding passed by the lucky\nstone. He thought it might be only a common stone, as he could not find the\nlucky stone in such a short space of time. He thought, I am not pure, and I am\nonly a poor man. So he left the lucky stone beside the road, and went on\nhunting. After a long search, weary and worn by hardships, a Sidha--a man of\npsychic powers--saw the poor man looking for the lucky stone. So he thought he\nwould fool the poor, deluded man who had passed by without recognizing the\nlucky stone. The Sidha threw a piece of glass in front of the man, which, as\nsoon as he saw it, he picked up, thinking surely it must he the lucky stone.\nHe had passed by the real lucky stone and picked up instead the simple ball of\nglass. He was over-joyed and gave away all his wealth, with the hope that his\nlucky stone would bring him anything he desired. So he went to the forest,\nwith the hope that he would find happiness there,\n\np. 83\n\nas the lucky stone was supposed to bring him anything for which he wished. In\nthe forest he tried to have the lucky stone bring forth the thing he wanted,\nbut it did not bring forth anything, for the reason it was not a lucky stone\nat all, it was merely a ball of glass. The poor, deluded man brought all the\nhardships upon himself, suffering alone and without wealth.\'\n\n"\'I will tell another story about an elephant, that will help you in the\nunderstanding of pure Wisdom.\n\n"\'In the midst of a forest there lived an elephant, the most gigantic of its\nkind. A Mahout of the forest followed the elephant and trapped him. His tusks\nwere very long, sharp and dangerous. The Mahout fettered him with chains, and\nstarted to bring him to the city, tied to another elephant. This gigantic\nelephant became mad with pain caused by the chains, as well as the loss of his\nliberty. With the help of his powerful tusks he shook himself free. The Mahout\nseated on this elephant became frightened, and fell to the ground. The giant\nelephant, bewildered by his freedom, passed over the Mahout without hurting\nhim, and raced to the security of the forest. The Mahout getting to his feet,\n\np. 84\n\nand alarmed at the loss of his beast of wealth, went after the elephant and\nfound him in the depth of the forest. The Mahout selected a spot where he knew\nthe elephant would pass. Then he dug a trench and covered it with leaves. The\nelephant after a long time came to the place and fell into the trench. This\ntime the Mahout fastened the elephant more securely. So again, the powerful\nanimal was enslaved.\n\n"\'Had this gigantic elephant stepped on the Mahout, whom once he shook from\nhis back and laid prostate upon the ground, he might easily have crushed him\nor dashed out his brains, then he would not have been captured again and\ndeprived of his precious liberty. Likewise, he who does not think of the\nresult of evil living, and that it would surely bring him to grief.\n\n"The King asked the master: \'Please give the reason why you narrated the story\nof this Lucky Stone, and the story of the elephant?\'\n\n"The Master replied: \'The man who had all wealth and knowledge, without pure\nWisdom, went in search of the Lucky Stone. That man is like yourself, for,\nalthough you are well versed in knowledge, you have not attained poise and\npeace of mind. This lesson, I meant to convey,\n\np. 85\n\nby telling the story of the Lucky Stone. In order to overcome suffering and\nhypocrisy and attain true renunciation, you have forsaken your kingdom,\nwealth, wife and relations, which were the real Lucky Stone, and you came to\nthe forest, which is the stone of glass.\n\n"\'The true renunciation was developing in you, little by little, in the midst\nof your worldly surroundings, but your mind was lead astray by the wrong ideal\nof renunciation. By delusion your mind was enveloped as by a dark cloud,\ninstead of being illumined, by the clear light of Spiritual understanding.\nThis renunciation of yours is not the renunciation which generates true\nhappiness. With the hopes that you might attain illumination, or the\nrealization of TRUTH--that which is real--you gave up everything that men hold\ndear. You have lost the Lucky Stone and are holding to the false, the stone of\nglass.\n\n"\'The wise say that those who reject the enjoyment which comes from their\ndaily lives, and the mind which is filled with imaginary things, are self-\ndestructive. By giving up your all, and running to the forest your mind did\nnot attain Divine peace, even when the valuable Lucky Stone\n\np. 86\n\nwas laid before you. Then what advantage is to be gained by finding the stone\nof glass?\n\n"\'The gigantic elephant, I also applied to you. The two long tusks are\ndiscrimination and indifference. Your ignorance is the driver which inflicted\nsuffering upon you, as the elephant was caused to suffer by the driver (the\nMahout). The chain and fetters stand for desires. The chain and fetters which\nbound the elephant will wear out, but the bonds of desire become stronger\nevery day. As the elephant shook itself free from the chains, so you gave up\nyour kingdom. Throwing the Mahout, or driver of the elephant,--stands for\novercoming the ignorance by the power of indifference to objects, or the\nfruits of your work. If we overcome the impure desires, then ignorance and\nrebirth will be destroyed.\n\n"\'To abandon the delusion of wealth, by sheer asceticism, will never dispel\nthe ghost, but if the delusion of wealth is destroyed through discrimination,\nthen the ghost of ignorance will leave forever.\n\n"\'At the time you reached this forest your ignorance was laid on the ground\nbefore you, but you did not cut its head off with the true renunciation. The\ngreat elephant did not kill the\n\np. 87\n\n[paragraph continues] Mahout, who was once laid on the ground at his feet. At\nthat time if the elephant had put one foot upon the Mahout, then he would not\nhave been made to fall into the trench, and suffer when he was\n[imprisoned](errata.htm#6) there.\n\n"\'But, O King, you have suffered more than the elephant here in the forest.\nYou threw away the Lucky Stone, that, was true renunciation, but why did you\nnot follow the advice of your wife? But you came to this forest and picked up\nthe stone of glass, which was not worth anything.\'\n\n"The King declared: \'I have given up my kingdom, my dear wife and all. Is not\nthis true renunciation, O Master?\'\n\n"The Master replied: \'True, you have given up your kingdom, your wife and all,\nbut that is not renunciation, as you are a slave to your desires, even now.\nBut by giving up all of them, you will attain the blessed state of Brahma.\'\n\n"The King said: \'All right, I will give up this forest and hills, I have no\ndesire for them; now, I have made the true renunciation.\'\n\n"The Master again said: \'Giving up this beautiful forest, will not make the\ntrue renunciation, as long as you have with you impure desires.\n\np. 88\n\n[paragraph continues] When you give them up, then only, will you attain divine\njoy.\'\n\n"The King answered: \'If this is not true renunciation, then, I will give up\nthe rest.\'\n\n"So the King threw his garments and all that he had into the fire and\npresented himself to the Master and said: \'Now, by thy grace, I have freed\nmyself of all things and thoughts that were only bondage, and the seed of the\nrebirth. By giving up all desires I have set myself free, and attained the\ntrue renunciation by thy kindness. What else remains to be done, O Master?\'\n\n"The Master replied: \'You have not done any thing. What you call a true\nrenunciation is only vain delusion.\'\n\n"The King said: \'While I remain within this body, the five snakes, which are\nthe sense organs remain. Therefore, I shall give them up in your presence.\'\n\n"So the King prepared to kill himself.\n\n"The Master stopped him by saying: \'What foolish thing are you trying to do?\nIs your body holding you from progress? \'What will you gain by giving up your\nbody? To kill or destroy your body is not true renunciation. O\n\np. 89\n\n[paragraph continues] King, if you will give up the seed or cause of this\nbody, which is the seed of rebirth, then you will make the true renunciation.\'\n\n"The King besought the Master to tell him how he might give up or control the\ncause, or the seed of the body.\n\n"The Master said: \'The Wise say the mind, with its thoughts, called by many\nnames, is one. The cause is attached to delusive objects. This restless mind\nforms the Universe and bondage. It is the mind which is the seed of all karma\n(spiritual cause and effect), and moves this body to and fro, like a tree in\nthe wind. Controlling this mind is true renunciation and Godly Bliss. O King,\nall other renunciations are not true.\n\n"\'After reaching the true renunciation you will be illumined in mind, free\nfrom oscillation; then you will recognize your true self with the self of\nBrahma, and you will be radiant with glory.\'\n\n"The King asked: \'What is the cause of the mind? What is its true nature? How\nshould I master it? O Master, enlighten me.\'\n\n"The Master answered: \'The true nature of the mind is determined by the\ndesires, as mind\n\np. 90\n\nand desires are one. Know, O King, the ideal of the "I" (Ego), which is the\nhouse in which exists all qualities of good and evil: this, is the seed of the\nmind. The first sprout that comes out of this seed is Egoism, and originates\nwithout form. Its apperception is by inner experience. This sprout is called\nBudhi (the reasoning intelligence). From this little shoot the many branches\nknown as thoughts take their origin through differentiation. The thought of\nthe mind, the reason and intelligence, called by different names are really\nonly Egoism. If you try to cut off the branches (thoughts) of the tree of the\nmind, you will not succeed, as the branches will produce more and more,\nthrough desires. But if you cut the root of the tree with the ax of Wisdom,\nthen the branches will die themselves, and the karma that causes the branches\n(desires) will disappear with them. But to merely cut off the branches, will\nnot harm the tree of the mind. You should cut the root of the tree or through\nvirtuous actions overcome the ideal of the Ego.\'\n\n"The King said: \'I am the Nature, that pure absolute consciousness which\nevolves. preserves, and destroys everything. I do not know the cause\n\np. 91\n\nof the "I", which is the nature of Wisdom. I have not been able to find the\nmeans which will remove the Egoism, the seed of the treacherous mind. My mind\nbetrayed me as I tried to overthrow this Ego, but it clings to me.\'\n\n"The Master said: \'No effect can be found without a cause. So search within to\nfind the cause of the Egoism that is always within you. Answer me, O King.\n\n"The King answered: \'The cause of this impure Egoism is the knowledge of the\nmind. How have I become mixed with this knowledge? I sink back when the\nknowledge of objects arise. How am I to arise above the objective world?\'\n\n"The Master answered: \'If you tell me the cause of knowledge, then I will give\nyou the means to arise above it.\'\n\n"The King then said: \'The existence of the illusory objects of knowledge is\nproduced through mind. If the illusory objects cease to exist, then no\nknowledge arises. Then the seed of the mind, Egoism will be absorbed.\'\n\n"The Master answered: \'As the illusory objects (body etc.) exist so the\nknowledge, but the illusory objects (body etc.) are unreal. Then what is the\nbasis for knowledge, O King?\'\n\np. 92\n\n"The King replied: \'Tell me first, O Master, how the body which enjoys all\nkarma, which [performs](errata.htm#7) through organs, (hands etc.) can be\nunreal?\'\n\n"The Master answered: \'This body, arising through karma, cannot be the cause,\ntherefore, neither the effect of intelligence, as it is itself illusory or\nnonexistent. The Egoism and all other illusory objects which arise through the\ndelusion of knowledge are not real. Therefore, all the objects which are not\nof the nature of cause and effect, are not real, any more than the mistaken\nconception of the snake in the rope.\'\n\n"The King said: \'All are the creation of Brahma, who was alone in the\nbeginning of the Universe. How, then, can you say that Brahma is not the cause\nof it?\'\n\n"The Master answered: \'Prior to the creation, the Parabrahma (Universal soul)\nalone shone as Truth, which is nondual and quiescent. He alone is without a\nsecond, then how can the Brahma be the cause?\'\n\n"The King asked: \'Is not Parabrahma (the Universal Soul) the cause?\'\n\n"The Master replied: \'Parabrahma (Universal Soul) is the emancipation, the\nimperishable, birthless, deathless, without beginning and without\n\np. 93\n\nend. The non-dual and unspeakable can not be reached by thought. How can\nParabrahma (Universal Soul) be the cause which is above the reach, of the mind\nand thought? How can one be an actor and an audience? As it would be\nimpossible, it must follow that this Universe is not created by any one, nor\nis self-created. The Supreme Will of the Absolute Consciousness is the Brahma\n(God), nothing else is the one true Wisdom. All the objects created out of\nthat Wisdom can be said to be none other, than the form of that Wisdom.\n\n"\'All is Brahma itself. Realize the one Reality, which will destroy ignorance,\nnever to rise again. There is no other path through which to destroy the\ndelusion of karma, which will surely vanish when ignorance and illusion are\ndestroyed. The Brahmic (Godly) state will be attained, then the mind through\nall-pervading Wisdom will merge into Paramatma (God), and will never be\nevolved into new creations by thoughts. That which is called Brahma, through\nthe Atmic Tattva (highest pure wisdom of the self), is none other than the\nlatent aspect of the Universe.\'\n\n"The King replied: \'All that you have taught\n\np. 94\n\nme is very reasonable. As before creation there was no Creator; so there is\nreally no Universe, there are no objects; illusory things do not really exist\naccording to your clear teaching. I understand the reality of myself and\nrecognize that external objects do not really exist. I have worshipped myself\nthrough many substances. Now I realize that all were unreal, through this wise\nteaching. I have become one without a thought of a second, as one Akasa\n(Ether) is everywhere.\'\n\n"Through the Master\'s reasoning, the King realized his reality, also, the true\ndiscrimination of time and space.\n\n"Mental activity is to understand the Universe, in all its different aspects.\nThey have existed in your mind a long time, but they will depart, leaving only\nBrahma alone.\n\n"The King was illumined by the Wisdom he attained and was immediately freed\nfrom Maya (illusion). He reached the state of Brahma or Brahmic (Divine) state\nand sank into Samadhi.\n\n"After some hours he awakened from meditation, and the Master asked: \'Are you\nfree from\n\np. 95\n\nall passion? Have you enjoyed the Brahmic Bliss? Have you enjoyed the Brahmic\nseat which is fulness of all wealth? Have you attained Atmic Wisdom? Are you\nfreed from all delusion? Have you met that which is worth meeting? Have you\nseen the Blessed One that is worthy to be seen?\'\n\n"The King replied: \'I have now the eternal peace. I have indeed reached the\nBrahmic state, which is above all. With thy kind help I have reached the\nBrahmajnan state, the powerful state of Divine Wisdom. O Master, why was I not\nable to reach this high state before?\'\n\n"The Master answered: \'When mind becomes absolutely at rest and one sees all\nwith impartial eyes, with vision turned inward, with all impurities of the\nmind gone, then it is easy for the Master to help the disciple, as there is no\ndoubt in the mind of the student.\'\n\n"\'Doubt is the big stone in the road of divine wisdom. The king attained the\nwealth of wealth, bliss of bliss, which is the divine wisdom, and the highest\ngood.\n\n"\'Master,\' said the King, \'Are not the Jivanmukta (bodily emancipated)\nperforming actions through their mind?\'\n\n"The Master answered: \'The mind is nothing\n\np. 96\n\nwithout desire; mind and desires bind one to rebirth. If one knows himself\n(the divine self), there is no fear of rebirth. Truth sets them free. Those\nJivanmukta (bodily emancipated) have realized the reality; therefore, their\nMinds do not generate impure desires, but generate pure desires. With pure\ndesire, you do not create rebirth. The lower mind, or work done under the\ninfluence of the lower mind produce cause but the higher mind or work done\nunder the influence of the higher mind does not produce any cause.\'\n\n"So the King gave up the idea of doing good for reward, but sought to do good\nfor the sake of good. Give up the idea of going to heaven, then you will shine\nlike the Light of Lights that is in all, and is everywhere,--which really you\nare. Let the lower mind go, that has a hankering to go from place to place,\nfrom earth to sky, and from sky to earth.\n\n"With the control of the lower mind, the rebirth is also controlled,--becomes\npeaceful, immovable, then you become one with pure Wisdom (motion and non-\nmotion).\'\n\n"\'O, Master\', said the King. \'How am I to attain that state where motion and\nnon-motion is one?\'\n\np. 97\n\n"The Master replied: \'As the ocean is rippled by the waves, but is still one,\nso all the Universe is non-dual, is Absolute Consciousness, compelling,\ndrawing intelligence unto itself. The ignorant will not understand the\ndifference, how the Truth and Brahma is the Universe itself,--motion in\nitself,--this Universe Created by itself. If you realize this outwardly, then\nthe blessed state is yours. This merely reverses the appearance, seen as the\nreal cause, as the rope in the dark appears as a snake.\n\n"\'By following pure wisdom, and association with the wise., then the spiritual\nvision will develop; then only can you truly realize as I have explained to\nyou--this creation and the destruction of the Universe.\n\n"\'If you practise according to your will, do your duty\n[conscientiously](errata.htm#8), then you will not fail to attain the Brahmic\nstate. Does not that do away with all the differences that arise from delusion\nand ignorance?\'\n\n"The Master disappeared, and the King thought to himself,--how can I\nunderstand that I am All Peace, All Rest, All Bliss, and Absolute Truth? The\nKing sank into Samadhi, which is above\n\np. 98\n\nall pain, misery and the Universe. It is True Peace, and True Silence. The\nMaster resumed the tender form of the Queen, and went through the sky by\nlevitation to her chamber in the palace. There she again graciously ruled over\nher people three years.\n\n"With her higher mind and power she changed her feminine body for a masculine\nform, and again visited the King, as she was teaching her King in the form of\na Master.\n\n"When she reached the forest where the King was, she found him in a seedless\nSamadhi. To acquaint him of her arrival she caused the forest to re-echo with\nher voice. This did not disturb the King, as he was not awakened from the\nseedless Samadhi. Though she shook him vigorously, he evinced no evidence of\nher presence.\n\n"\'This is truly wonderous\', said the Queen, \'he has merged into the seat of\nBrahma, I will concentrate on his finer body. If I find any residue of truth\ntypifying the seed of intelligence in his heart, I will join my King and live\nwith him joyfully; otherwise, I shall have to give up my feminine form, and\nmyself obtain the Brahmic\n\np. 99\n\n[paragraph continues] State, then I will be free from re-birth.\'\n\n"The Queen concentrated on the finer form of the King, and found there was\nstill a residue of good qualities in the heart of the King."\n\nRam asked: "When one\'s mind has control, and has merged into the inner vision,\nhow can there still be a residue of good or bad qualities in the heart?"\n\nRishi Vashisht answered: "Like the tree, the branches, flowers, and fruit are\nall contained in the seed, so the cause of intelligence, like Satwa, always\nrests in the heart. The Jivanmukta (bodily emancipated) who has controlled his\nmind, does not die and is nut affected by diseases or pains,--he is living in\nthe world, but above the world, like the Lotus flower that lives in the water,\nbut does not get wet. Even in the heart of the Jivanmukta, the cause of the\nintelligence, latent in the heart, is like the tree that is in the seed.\n\n"O Ram, the Great Yogin Queen gave up the grosser body of the Master and\nmerged into the finer form of the King, that is, higher\n[consciousness](errata.htm#9),--without beginning or end. She caused it to\nvibrate and return to her body, as\n\np. 100\n\na bird to its cage. Again in the Master form, she chanted the Divine Song,\nwhich brought the King to consciousness, as the rays of the Sun make the Lotus\nflower bloom.\n\n"The King saw his dear Guru (Spiritual Teacher) sitting before him. With great\njoy he praised the Master (Queen).\n\n"The Master said: \'From the day I parted from you my mind did not find blessed\npeace. Even in the Higher Heavens, there is no joy for me, except with you.\'\n\n"The King replied: \'Blessed, Holy God, I have obtained this blessed state by\nThy favor, and am freed from all pain and misery. Even the Higher Heavens did\nnot give me the blessed joy that I have from the seedless Samadhi (trance-like\nmeditation). Now I am Master of ail. Blessed Peace is mine. I can roam freely\nin Heaven and on earth.\'\n\n"The Master asked: \'Have you tasted the Brahmic Bliss,--God--like joy, which\nis above all pleasure and pains? Have you given up all older thoughts from\nwhich arise the ideas of, this is mine, and that is thine? Can you hold and\nequal vision over all? Are you able to do\n\np. 101\n\nyour daily duty without effort, or being affected by it? Are you free from\nhate and love? Have you realized your all?\'\n\n"The King replied: \'Indeed, I have acquired all the spiritual benefits. I have\nknown all that is worth knowing, have seen all that is worth seeing, there is\nnothing that I long to see or hear.\'\n\n"So the Master (Queen) and the King with great respect for one another,\nenjoyed great bliss and Divine joy, as one in mind and one in everything. They\nhad destroyed delusion of Maya, (illusion), by the pure Wisdom. They were firm\nlike the Himalayan Mountains, not to be shaken by the rustling winds.\n\n"The Queen in the form of the Master, found by the power of Samyam (highest\nconcentration of the Raja Yogi), that the King\'s mind was pure and free from\nall illusion. She also thought, if one is filled with wisdom, shouldn\'t he\nenjoy the joy that comes without seeking; or how can it be said he or she had\ntrue wisdom? She thought she would interrogate the King further. \'There is a\nfestival in the Higher Heavens to-day,\' said the Queen, \'I shall be there, I\nwill return tonight.\'\n\np. 102\n\n"The Queen discarded her heavy male body, and resumed her own beautiful form.\nShe reached her palace by air, and performed her Queenly duties all day. After\nsunset she again went forth by levitating her body to the forest where the\nKing was. The Queen resumed her disguise of the Master\'s form, descended\nbefore her husband with dejected mien, long and downcast heart.\n\nThe King rising said: \'My Perfect One, my Guru, what has affected you,--you\nare suffering from pain? What is it? May you overcome it as a person of\nWisdom. You are not affected by pain or joy, as the water falling on the\nduck\'s back, does not affect her.\'\n\n"The Master related the following story: \'The true Jnani who visions all with\nan equal eye, and sees all in all, will never be a true Jnani as long as he\ndoes not use his organs, as long as he possesses a body. Otherwise, that\nperson is an imposter. The ignorant are those who do not perform their karma\n(actions), but try to avoid them. They will suffer as they are trying to\nseparate the oil from the mustard seed, which is inseparable. As long as the\nbody exists, pains and pleasures remain. They who\n\np. 103\n\ntry to do away with affections and so forth, are like a man who tries to cut\nair with a sword. Pain and an impure body always go together. The Brahma has\nthe organs of Karmaendriya (organs of action), and the Jnanendriya (organs of\nsense), and follows the path which is forever followed by the ignorant and\nwise, which has moved the concourse with Universal Law.\n\n"\'The Wise daily do their duty, as long as they stay in their bodies. They are\nnot affected by performing actions, but the ignorant mind is never at peace,\nis ever moving and affected by pain and pleasure.\n\n"\'The Cause of my pain--it is not pain when told to those we love. This\nmorning I went to the Higher Heavens for the meeting. I went there by air.\nAfter the meeting, when coming through the sky to this place, I saw before me\nthe Rishi Divwasa coming through the clouds. I said to him, Thou art ill clad;\nand I acted like a silly woman whereupon the Rishi cursed me. He said, \'You\nare acting like a woman, so your form will change to female from now on, every\nnight.\' Hearing this I begged for pardon, but\n\np. 104\n\nthe Rishi disappeared. This is the cause of my distress. I have to change to\nwoman\'s form every night. I am ashamed.\'\n\n"\'Do not grieve,\' said the King, \'changing your form will not change you from\nwise to ignorant, only the unwise can be so affected by pain.\'\n\n"\'The sun is setting,\' the Master (Queen) said to the King, \'and the change in\nme is taking place.\'\n\n"The King said: \'you are wise, and you know the true path, so you shall not be\naffected by the change.\' So they retired for the night.\n\n"At dawn the Queen was again the Master; so she was a man by day, and by night\na woman.\n\n"\'O King, how long, I ask, are we going to live like this? I want to have a\nhusband, but I cannot find one to equal you in the three worlds. You should\nmarry me, without the fear of Heaven or Hell.\'\n\n"The King was prepared for her proposal, and made ready for the marriage\nrites. White silken robes were procured by the power of thought. When the sun\nset, the marriage ceremony\n\np. 105\n\ntook place. Every other day the King went into Samadhi (deep meditation), then\nthe Queen would go to her Palace, perform her Queenly duties, and return to\nthe forest before the King awakened from his Samadhi. Thus the time passed\naway.\n\n"The Queen wanted to enquire into her husband\'s mind, so one day with power of\nher Yoga, she created a heaven of illusion in the forest, also an illusory God\nto appear before the King. When the King saw the God and His Heaven, he asked:\n\'What good karma have I performed to induce you to visit me?\' "I am attracted\nby your love and [purity](errata.htm#10), and I came to take you to the Higher\nHeavens. It is fitting for you to leave. The Divine Maidens will wait upon\nthee, and will always be at your command. O King, you will live there as long\nas you wish. This place is not good enough for you to live in; Heaven is the\nplace for you, and you will not want to leave it. For that reason I came to\ntake thee."\n\n"The King with a gesture of gentle remonstrance, replied, \'I have known all\nthe pleasure of Heaven. One locality is the same as another\n\np. 106\n\nto me. Wherever I am, there is my Heaven and Bliss. Be pleased to return to\nyour throne. I have no desire to go with you.\' Hearing this, the Indra (God)\ndisappeared. The Queen felt that the King had attained Master control.\n\n"The Queen decided to try the King further. It chanced that the King was\nsitting at the Holy Ganges watching the Moon rise. The Queen, with power of\nthought, created a lover and embraced him. When the King came out of his\ntrance and found his wife in the company of another man, he returned to the\nriver at once, without disturbing his peace of mind. When the Queen went to\nthe King, with embarrassment, she appeared before her husband, ashamed.\nWithout evincing the least sign of anger, he said tenderly: \'Why did you, my\ndear, leave your lover so soon?--If you wish you may go back to him and\ngratify your passion.\' Thus spoke the king without anger.\n\n"\'It is the duty,\' said the Queen, \'of a good husband to overlook the faults\nof his wife, who is ignorant and carried away by her emotions; and I am\ntrusting that you will forgive me.\'\n\n"The King replied: \'The sun may rise in the\n\np. 107\n\n[paragraph continues] West, but never will anger arise in me. A house may be\nbuilt in the air, but anger will never arise in me. I have controlled both\nlove and hate.\'\n\n"The Queen understood that her husband was really a Master, and had attained\nthe pure Wisdom of Divine Peace.\n\n"\'The time has now arrived for me to show myself in my true colors, and let\nhim see me as I really am.\' She assumed her Queenly body and appeared before\nhim. The King beheld his Queen, whom he had left at his Kingdom twenty years\nago. He could not believe his eyes.\n\n"\'How is this. Am I beholding my Queen? Who are you, please speak?\'\n\n"The Queen replied: \'Yes, I am your wife, with whom you have lived for nearly\none hundred years. You left me at the Palace when you retired to the forest.\'\n\n"\'So dearest, it was you who came in the guise of Master Kunbhamuni to save\nme?\'\n\n"\'It was I who took the form of Master; it was I who gave you Divine Wisdom;\nit was I who took the Madanika (another woman\'s form); it was I who tested\nyour Wisdom. Now\n\np. 108\n\ngo into Samadhi; then you will understand all that has been happening,\' said\nthe Queen.\n\n"The King went into Samadhi, the Brahmic or Universal consciousness. In that\nstate he saw all the events and remembered them from the time he vacated his\nkingdom, to the time of his appearing to his Queen Chundalai in her feminine\nbody. When he came out of his Samadhi, he was blessed with divine peace and\njoy. With joy he looked upon his wife who was standing before him. He embraced\nher, who was the embodiment of pure love and grace.\n\n"The King could not find words with which to thank his wife. Later he began to\nspeak: \'Through your great Wisdom you have saved me, who was crying in the\ndarkness from ignorance. Who is there in the Universe to equal thee? You are\nthe Blessed Light, dispelling the fear of the ignorant. How can I repay thee\nfor all that you have done for me? You are on equality with the Divine Mother\n*:\n\np. 109\n\n"\'I saw you in despair,\' lovingly replied the Queen. \'Your self-imposed\npenances were destroying your body. That kind of penance is used only by the\nignorant. I came to save and lift you from worldly pain. Do not praise me. I\nbut did my duty. Tell me, dear husband, are you free from the world\'s\ntroubles? Have you reached the divine state which will not be affected by\naction or thought?\'\n\n"\'All doubt and desire have vanished from my mind,\' said the King. \'I shall\nnever fall through the senses. I have become like Askasa (Ether). I am above\npain or pleasure. I have attained the highest Samadhi. There is no joy like\nthe joy of Samadhi. I have reached the highest state; I am the Sun of the\nSuns; I am the Light of the Lights; I am pure Wisdom; I am the Absolute\nConsciousness. I realize my Reality, which is none other than THAT (God). My\nwife, you are my Spiritual Teacher. I worship Thee.\'\n\n"\'What do you intend to do next,\' questioned the Queen?\n\n"\'From now on,\' answered the King, \'according to thy dictates, I shall perform\nmy duties. I will live in the world, but not of it, like the\n\np. 110\n\n[paragraph continues] Lotus flowers which grow in the lake but never get wet.\'\n\n"\'If Thou art willing to do as I say, then let us go back and reign over our\nKingdom, as Jivanmuktas (bodily emancipated).\'\n\n"\'I will do as you say,\' replied her husband.\n\n"The Queen then created an elephant. It was decorated with rubies and other\ngems. They both mounted the elephant\'s back, and when they came near the town,\nwith the power of her mind she created an army to escort them into the city.\nThey were received by their people.\n\n"The King and Queen were enthroned, and ruled wisely and well ten thousand\nyears, and then they gave up the bodies and attained emancipation of the Soul.\n\n"O Ram, do you daily karma. Pure wisdom will develop in you. You will reach\nthe Blessed state Which the King and Queen have attained,--Liberation."\n\nThus spoke the great Rishi Vashisht of Wisdom, to Ram.\n\np. 111\n\n#### MAHABHARATA xii. 293 ff.\n\n    "When old and grey, when strength decays,  \nBy foes when crushed, in evil days,  \nFrom fortune\'s heights when downward hurled--  \nYes, then let men renounce the world;  \nBut not in days of youth and health,  \nWhen crowned with glory, blest with wealth.  \nThose scripture texts which praise as best  \nA life ascetic, lone, unblest,  \nDragged sadly on in gloomy woods,  \nAnd dreary, doleful solitudes,  \nAre fictions hatched in squalid schools  \nBy needy unbelieving fools,  \nWhich look like truth, but proved, are found  \nTo rest on no substantial ground.\n\n    "To savage beasts it is not given  \nBy forest life to merit heaven;  \nYet this same life, by hermits led,  \nTheir future bliss ensures, \'tis said! p. 112\n\n    "When men no pleasure feel, nor pain,  \nA state of stupid torpor gain.  \nThey then have reached perfection, rise  \nTo heaven, so say the would-be wise.  \nBut should not trees,--if this be true,--  \nAnd boulders, gain perfection too?  \nFor they are calm and torpid, feel  \nNor pain nor pleasure, woe nor weal;  \nThey dread no want, they seek no ease,  \nLike self-tormenting devotees.\n\n    "Abandon, then, thy vain design;  \nBy kingly virtues seek to shine.  \nSee how by acts all mortals strive  \nTheir ends to gain, through effort thrive,  \nInaction ne\'er perfection brings;  \nFrom strenuous deeds alone it springs."\n\nTranslation by J.
