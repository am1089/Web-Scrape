With pious care  \nHe turned him to his evening prayer,  \nPerformed each customary rite,  \nAnd sought his lodging for the night,  \nWith Sita and his brother laid  \n\np. 237  \n\nBeneath the grove\'s delightful shade,  \nFirst good Sutikshnu, when he saw  \nThe shades of night around them draw,  \n   With hospitable care  \nThe princely chieftains entertained  \nWith store of choicest food ordained  \n   For holy hermit\'s fare.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[236:1](ry205.htm#fr_420) Near the celebrated Ramagiri or Rama\'s Hill, now\nRam-tek, near Nagpore \\--the scene of the Yaksha\'s exile in the _Messenger\nCloud_.\n\n[236:1b](ry205.htm#fr_421) A hundred _As\'vamedhas_ or sacrifices of a horse\nraise the sacrificer to the dignity of Indra.\n\n[236:2b](ry205.htm#fr_422) Indra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto VIII.: The Hermitage.](ry206.htm)\n\n'
