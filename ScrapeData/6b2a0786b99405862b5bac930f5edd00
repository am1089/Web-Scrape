S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a spoke :-- Then the Danava, the devotee of S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a, got up from his flower strewn bed, meditating on S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a,\nearly in the morning time, at the Brahma Muhurta. Quitting his night dress, he\ntook his bath in pure water and put on a fresh washed clothing. He then put\nthe bright Tilak mark on his forehead and, performing the daily necessary\nworship, he worshipped his I _st_ a devata (The Deity doing good to him). He\nthen saw the auspicious things such as curd, ghee, honey, fried rice, etc.,\nand distributed as usual, to the Brahma _n_ as the best jewels, pearls,\nclothing and gold. Then for his marching to turn out auspicious, he gave at\nthe feet of his Guru Deva priceless gems, jewels, pearls, diamonds, etc., and\nfinally he gave to the poor Brahmi _n_ s with great gladness, elephants,\nhorses, wealth, thousands of stores, two lakhs of cities and one hundred ko\n_t_ is of villages. He then gave over to his son, the charge of his kingdom\nand of his wife, and all the dominions, wealth, property, all the servants and\nmaid servants, all the stores and conveyances. He dressed himself for the war\nand took up bows and arrows and arrow cases. By the command of the King, the\narmies began to gather. Three lakhs of horses, one lakh elephants, one ayuta\nchariots, three Ko _t_ is of bowmen, three Ko _t_ is armoured soldiers and\nthree Ko _t_ is of trident holders got themselves ready. Then the King counted\nhis forces and appointed one Commander-in-Chief, (Maharatha), skilled in arts\nof\n\n\n\np. 888\n\n\n\nwarfare, over the whole army. Thus the generals were apppointed over the three\nlakh Ak _s_ auhi _n_ i forces and their provisions were collected by three\nhundred Ak _s_ auhi _n_ i men. He, then, thinking of S\xc2\x92ri Hari, started for\nwar, accompanied by his vast army. (Note :-- One Ak _s_ auhi _n_ i consists of\na large army consisting of 21,870 chariots, as many elephants, 65,610 horses,\nand 109,350 foot). He then mounted on a chariot built of excellent jewels and,\nheaded by his Guru and all his other elders, went to S\xc2\x92ankara. O Narada!\nBhagavan Mahadeva was at that time, staying on the banks of Pu _s_ pabhadra.\nThat place was Sidhas\xc2\x92rama (the hermitage where the yogic successes had been\nobtained and can easily be acquired in future for the Siddhas as well a Siddha\nK _s_ ettra.) It was the place where the Muni Kapila practised Tapasya, in the\nholy land of Bharata. It was bounded on the east by the western ocean, on the\nwest by the Malaya mountain, on the south, by the S\xc2\x92ri S\xc2\x92aila mountain and on\nthe north by the Gandha Madana Mountain. It was five yojanas wide and one\nhundred times as long. This auspicious river in Bharata yields great religious\nmerits and is always full of clear, sparkling running water. She is the\nfavourite wife of the Salt Ocean and She is very blessed. Issuing from\nS\xc2\x92aravati Himalayas, She drops into the ocean. Keeping the river Gomati\n(Goomti) by her left; She falls into the west ocean. S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a,\narriving there, saw Mahadeva under a Peepul tree near its root with a smiling\ncountenance, like one Ko _t_ i Suns seated in a yogic posture. His colour was\nwhite like a pure crystal; as if the Fire of Brahma was emitting from every\npore of His body (burning with Brahma-Teja); He was wearing the tiger skin\nand, holding the trident and axe. He dispels the fear of death of His Bhaktas;\nHis face is quite calm. He, the Lord of Gauri, is the Giver of the fruits of\nTapasya and of all sons of wealth and prosperity. The smiling face of \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92uto\n_s_ a (one who is pleased quickly) is always thinking of the welfare of the\nBhaktas; He is the Lord of the Universe, the Seed of the universe, the All-\nform (all-pervading), and the Progenitor of the universe. He is omnipresent,\nAll pervading, the Best in this universe, the Destroyer of this universe, the\nCause of all causes, and the Saviour from the hells. He is the Awakener and\nBestower of Knowledge, the Seed of all knowledges, and He Himself is of the\nnature of Knowledge and Bliss. Seeing that Eternal Puru _s_ a, the King of the\nDanavas at once descended from his chariot and bowed down with devotion to Him\nand to Bhadra Kali on His left and and to Kartikeya on his front. The other\nattendants did the same. S\xc2\x92ankara, Bhadra Kali and Skanda all blessed him.\nNandis\xc2\x92vara and others got up from their\n\n\n\np. 889\n\n\n\nseats on seeing the Danava King and began to talk with each other on that\nsubject. The King addressed S\xc2\x92iva and sat by Him. Bhagavan Mahadeva, the\nTranquil Self, then, spoke to him, thus :-- O King! Brahma, the knower of\nDharma and the Creator of the world, is the Father of Dharrna, The religious\nMarichi, a devotee of Vi _sn_ u, is the son of Brahma. The religious Prajapati\nKas\xc2\x92yapa is also the Brahma\xc2\x92s son. Dak _s_ a gladly gave over to Kas\xc2\x92yapa in\nmarriage, his thirteen daughters. Danu, fortunate and chaste, is also one of\nthem.\n\n\n\n34-64. Danu had forty sons, all spirited and known as Danavas. The powerful\nViprachitti was the prominent amongst them. Viprachitti\xc2\x92s son was Dambha, self\ncontrolled and very much devoted to Vi _sn_ u. So much so that for one lakh\nyears he recited the Vi _sn_ u mantra at Pu _s_ kara. His Guru (spiritual\nteacher) was S\xc2\x92ukracharya; and, by his advice, he recited the mantra of S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a, the Highest Self. He got you as his son, devoted to Kri _sn_ a. In\nyour former birth, you were the chief attendant Gopa (cow-herd) of Kri _sn_ a.\nYou were very religious. Now, by Radhika\xc2\x92s curse, you are born in Bharata, as\nthe Lord of the Danavas, powerful, heroic, valorous, and chivalrous. All the\nthings from Brahma down to a blade of grass, the Vai _sn_ avas regard as very\ntrifling; even if they get Salokya, Sar _st_ i, Sayujya and Samipya of Hari,\nthey do not care a straw for that. Without serving Hari, they do not accept\nthose things, even if those are thrust on them. Even Brahmahood and\nimmortality, the Vai _sn_ avas count for nothing. They want to serve Hari\n(Seva-bhava). Indrahood, Manuhood, they do not care. You, too, are a real Kri\n_sn_ a Bhakta. So what do you care for those things that belong to the Devas,\nthat are something like false to you. Give back to the Devas their kingdoms\nthus and please Me. Let the Devas remain in their own places and let you enjoy\nyour kingdom happily. No need now for further quarrels. Think that you all\nbelong to the same Kas\xc2\x92yapa\xc2\x92s family. The sins that are incurred, for example,\nthe murder of a Brahmi _n_ , etc., are not even one-sixteenth of the sins\nincurred by hostilities amongst the relatives. If, O King! You think that by\ngiving away to the Devas their possessions, your property will be diminished,\nthen think that no one\xc2\x92s days pass ever in one and the same condition.\nWhenever Prakriti is dissolved, Brahma also vanishes. Again He appears by the\nWill of God. This occurs always. True, that knowledge is increased by true\nTapasya; but memory fails then. This is certain. He who is the creator of this\nworld, does his work of creation gradually by the help of his Knowledge-power\n(J\xc3\xb1ana-S\xc2\x92akti). In the Satya Yuga, Dharma reigns in full; in the Treta Yuga,\none quarter is diminished; again in the Dvapara only one-half remains. And in\nthe Kali Yuga, only one quarter remains. Thus Dharma gets increase and\ndecrease. At the end of the\n\n\n\np. 890\n\n\n\nKali, the Dharma will be seen very feeble as the phase of the Moon is seen\nvery thin on the Dark Moon night. See, again, the Sun is very powerful in\nsummer; not so in winter. At midday the Sun is very hot; it does not remain so\nin the morning and evening. The Sun rises at one time; then he is considered\nas young at another time he becomes very powerful and at another time he goes\ndown. Again in times of distress (i.e., during the cloudy days) the Sun gets\nentirely obscured. When the Moon is devoured by Rahu (in the Lunar Eclipse),\nthe Moon quivers. Again when the Moon becomes liberated (i.e., when the\neclipse passes away) She becomes bright again. In the Full-Moon night She\nbecomes full but She does not remain so always. In the Dark fortnight She\nwanes every day. In the bright fortnight She waxes every day. In the bright\nfortnight, the Moon becomes healthy and prosperous and in the dark fortnight,\nthe Moon becomes thinner and thinner as if attacked with consumption. In the\ntime of eclipse She becomes pale and in the cloudy weather, She is obscured.\nThus the Moon also becomes powerful at one time and weak and pale at another\ntime. Vali now resides in Patala, having lost all his fortunes; but, at some\nother time, he will become Devendra (the Lord of the Devas). This earth\nbecomes at one time covered with grains and the resting-place of all beings;\nand, at another time, She becomes immersed under water. This universe appears\nat one time and disappears at another. Everything, moving or non-moving,\nsometimes appears and again, at another time, disappears. Only Brahma, the\nHighest Self, remains the same. By His grace, I have got the name Mrityunjaya\n(the Conqueror of Death). I, too, am witnessing many Prakritik dissolutions, I\nwitnessed repeatedly many dissolutions and will in future, witness many\ndissolutions. The Paramatman becomes of the nature of Prakriti. Again it is He\nthat is the Puru _s_ a (male principle). He is the Self; He is the individual\nsoul (Jiva). He thus assumes various forms. And, again, Lo! He is beyond all\nforms! He who always repeats His Name and sings His Glory, can conquer, at\nsome occasion, death. He is not to come under the sway of this birth, death,\ndisease, old age and fear. He has made Brahma the Creator, Vi _sn_ u the\nPreserver and Me the Destroyer. By His Will, we are possessed of those\ninfluences and powers. O King! Having deputed Kala, Ag _n_ i and Rudra, to do\nthe destruction work, I Myself repeat only His name and sing His glory, day\nand night, incessantly. My name is, on that account, Mrityunjaya. By His\nKnowledge Power, I am fearless. Death flies away fast from Me as serpents fly\naway at the sight of Garu _d_ a, the Vinata;s son. O Narada! Thus saying,\nS\xc2\x92ambhu, the Lord of all, the Progenitor of all, remained silent. Hearing the\nabove words of S\xc2\x92ambhu, the King thanked Mahadeva again and again and spoke in\nsweet humble words.\n\n\n\np. 891\n\n\n\n65-74. S\xc2\x92ankhachuda said :-- The words spoken by Thee are quite true. Still I\nam speaking a few words. Kindly hear. Thou hast spoken just now that very\ngreat sins are incurred by kindred hostilities. How is it, then, that He\nrobbed Vali of his whole possessions and sent him down into Patala? Gadadhara\nVi _sn_ u could not recover Vali\xc2\x92s glory. But I have done that. Why did the\nDevas kill Hira _n_ yaksa and Hira _n_ yakas\xc2\x92ipu, S\xc2\x92umbha and the other\nDanavas? In by gone days, we laboured hard when the nectar was obtained out of\nthe churning of the ocean; but the best fruit was reaped by the Devas only.\nHowever, all these point that this universe is but the mere sporting ground of\nParamatman, Who has become of the nature of Prakriti (the polarities of the\none and the same current to produce electric effects). Whomsoever He grants\nglory and fortune, he only gets that. The quarrel of the Devas and the Danavas\nis eternal. Victory and defeat come to both the parties alternately. So it is\nnot proper for Thee to come here in this hostility. For Thou art the God, of\nthe nature of the Highest Self. Before Thee, we both are equal. So it is a\nmatter of shame, no doubt, for Thee to stand up against us in favour of the\ngods. The glory and fame that will result to Thee, if Thou art victorious,\nwill not be so much as it will be if we get the victory. On the contrary the\ninglory and infamy that will result to Thee if Thou dost get dire defeat will\nbe inconceivably much more than what would come to us if we are defeated. (For\nwe are low and Thou art Great.)\n\n\n\n75-79. Mahadeva laughed very much when he heard the Danava\xc2\x92s words and replied\n:-- O King! You are descended from the Brahmi _n_ family. So what shame shall\nI incur if I get defeat in this fighting against you. In former days, the\nfight took place between Madhu and Kai _t_ abha; again between Hira _n_ ya\nKas\xc2\x92ipu and Hira _n_ yaksa and S\xc2\x92ri Hari. I also fought with the Asura\nTripura. Again the serious fight took place also between S\xc2\x92umbha and the other\nDaityas and the Highest Prakriti Devi, the Ruler of all, and the Progenitrix\nof all and the Destructrix of all. And, then, you were the Pari _s_ ada\nattendant of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Highest Self.\n\n\n\nNote :-- S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a is the Eternal Puru _s_ a beyond the Gu _n_ as. He\ncreates Prakriti. All the creation is effected by Him. He is the Master of all\nthe S\xc2\x92aktis. These S\xc2\x92aktis come from Him and go into Him. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a\nplays with these S\xc2\x92aktis, these lines of Forces, very powerful and terrible,\nindeed, that go to create, preserve and destroy the whole universe. These\nLines of Forces have their three properties :-- (1) Origin; (2) direction and\n(3) magnitude. And finally they come back to their origin. This makes one\nKalpa, one Life, one Moment, one in the Full One. The Gu _n_ as come out of\nthese S\xc2\x92aktis, these Lines of Forces. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a\n\n\n\np. 892\n\n\n\nis the Great Reservoir, the Great Centre of Forces, Powerful, Lovely and\nTerrible. All the events as described here, appear in the intermediate stages\nwhen the Fourth Dimension passes into the Third Dimension, etc. The Fourth\nDimension does not at once turn out into the Third Dimension but it takes\nplace by degrees. This explains our dreams, visions, etc., which, if seen when\nthe mind is pure, turn out to be true.\n\n\n\n80-82. So the Daityas, that were killed before, cannot be compared with you.\nThen why shall I feel shame in fighting against you? I am sent here by S\xc2\x92ri\nHari for saving the Devas. So either give back to the Devas their possessions,\nor fight with Me. No need in speaking thus quite useless talks. O Narada! Thus\nspeaking, Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ankara remained silent. S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a got up at once\nwith his ministers.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-first Chapter in the Ninth Book on the meeting of\nMahadeva and S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a for an encounter in conflict in the Mahapura _n_\nam S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Maharsi Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 22](bk09ch22.htm)\n\n'
