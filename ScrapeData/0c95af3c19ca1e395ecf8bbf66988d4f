Nand. refers the term bhikshu, which has been rendered by 'ascetic,' i.\ne. a member of the fourth order, to the six sorts of beggars enumerated by\nPara _s_ ara. But as the first three orders are mentioned in this _S_ loka, it\nis certainly more natural to translate the term as has been done above.\n\n29\\. 1 Nand. thinks that hermits or members of the third order are meant by\nthis term. But it seems preferable to refer it to the _Ri_ shi authors of the\nVeda, to whom the first of the five sacrifices, the study of the Veda, is more\nimmediately addressed. See \xc3\x82past.

The organ must once be cleaned with earth, the hindparts three times, the\none hand (the left) ten times, both hands together seven times, and both feet\ntogether three times.\n\n26\\. Such is the purification ordained for householders; it is double for\nstudents treble for hermits; and quadruple for ascetics.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXI.](sbe07063.htm)\n\n"
