Next follows the Upanishad of the Sa _m_ hita 2.\n\n2\\. The former half is the earth, the latter half the heaven, their union the\nair 3, thus says Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya; their union is the ether, thus did\nMakshavya teach it.\n\n3\\. That air is not considered 4 independent 5, therefore I do not agree with\nhis (Manduka's) son.\n\n4\\. Verily, the two are the same, therefore air is\n\np. 248\n\nconsidered independent, thus says \xc3\x82gastya. For it is the same, whether they\nsay air or ether [1](sbe01229.htm#fn_624).\n\n5\\. So far with reference to deities (mythologically); now with reference to\nthe body (physiologically):\n\n6\\. The former half is speech, the latter half is mind, their union breath\n(pra _n_ a), thus says _S_ uravira [2](sbe01229.htm#fn_625) Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya.\n\n7\\. But his eldest son said: The former half is mind, the latter half speech.\nFor we first conceive with the mind indeed [3](sbe01229.htm#fn_626), and then\nwe utter with speech. Therefore the former half is indeed mind, the latter\nhalf speech, but their union is really breath.\n\n8\\. Verily, it is the same with both, the father (Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya) and the\nson [4](sbe01229.htm#fn_627).\n\n9\\. This (meditation as here described), joined [5](sbe01229.htm#fn_628) with\nmind, speech, and breath, is (like) a chariot drawn by two horses and one\nhorse between them (prash _t_ ivahana).\n\n10\\. And he who thus knows this union, becomes united with offspring, cattle,\nfame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.\n\n11\\. Now all this comes from the Ma _n_ _d_ ukeyas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[247:1](sbe01228.htm#fr_621) This last portion of the Upanishad is found in\nthe MS. discovered by Dr. Buhler in Kashmir, and described by him in the\njournal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1877, p. 36. I have\ncollated it, so far as it was possible to read it, many lines being either\nbroken off altogether, or almost entirely obliterated.\n\n[247:2](sbe01228.htm#fr_622) Sa _m_ hita is the sacred text in which all\nletters are closely joined. The joining together of two letters is called\ntheir sa _m_ hita; the first letter of a joined group the purvarupa (n.), the\nsecond the uttararupa. For instance, in agnim i _l_ e the m is purvarupa, the\ni uttararupa, and mi their sa _m_ hita or union.\n\n[247:3](sbe01228.htm#fr_623) As in worshipping the _S_ alagrama stone, we\nreally worship Vishnu, so we ought to perceive the earth, the heaven, and the\nair when we pronounce the first and the second letters of a group, and that\ngroup itself.\n\n[247:4](sbe01228.htm#fr_624) Mene has here been taken as 3rd pers. sing. perf.\npassive. The commentator, however, explains it as an active verb, ni _s_ _k_\nitavan.\n\n[247:5](sbe01228.htm#fr_625) Because it is included in the ether, not the\nether in the air.
