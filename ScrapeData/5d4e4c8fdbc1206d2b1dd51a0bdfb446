Vyasa said :-- After performing duly his religious rites there, the son of\nHiranya Kas'ipu saw before him an unbrageous peepul tree.\n\n\n\n2-3. There he saw along with the feathers of vultures, the terrible, sharpened\nunder a stone, various glittering arrows, arrayed in due order; and he was\nsurprised to think who could have kept such arrows, well guarded in this very\nholy hermitage of the Ri _s_ is.\n\n\n\n4-5. While Prahlada was thus meditating in his mind, he saw before him,\nwearing the skin of a black antelope, the two sons of Dharma, the two Munis\nNara Naraya _n_ a, loaded on their heads with high clots of hairs. Before them\nwere placed the two white bows named S'arngam and \xc3\x82jagavam, (Pinaka) the bows\nof Vi _sn_ u and S'iva respectively, bearing their qualified marks, as well as\ntheir two inexhaustible big quivers.\n\n\n\n6-10. The Lord of the Daityas, then, saw those two blessed ones, the two Ri\n_s_ is Nara Naraya _n_ a, the two sons of Dharma, deeply absorbed in\nmeditation. Seeing this, he became very much enraged, his eyes became red, and\nhe began to address them thus :-- O two Ascetics! Has vain arrogance possessed\nyour mind to destroy religion? It is never seen nor even heard, that the\npractice of severe asceticism and the holding of the bows and arrows, were\ncarried into effect simultaneously by one man in any of the Four Ages. These\ntwo are contradictory things. That may be worthy in the Kali Yuga? This\nasceticism is fit for the Brahma _n_ as; why, then are the bows and arrows\nheld by you? There is an irreconcilable difference between the holding of\nclotted hairs on the head and the holding in the hand of the bows and arrows.\nTherefore, do you practise religious rites, with feelings befitting your\ndivine positions!\n\n\n\n11\\. Vyasa said :-- O Descendant of Bharata! On hearing thus the Prahlada's\nwords, the Nara Ri _s_ i said :-- O Lord of the Daityas! What matters it to\nyou? Why do you, for nothing, trouble yourself with our tapasya.\n\n\n\n12\\. An able man can accomplish any thing. It is widely known in the three\nworlds, that we are able to accomplish these two things contemporaneously. O\nthou of weak understanding!\n\n\n\n13\\. In the battle field as well as in asceticism, we can shew our prowess.\nWhat have you got to do with us in these matters? The road before you is\nunobstructed, you can go wherever you like; why do you brag of your own\nmerits?\n\n\n\n14\\. You are very dull and stupid; what can you understand of a Brahma _n_ ic\nglory that is very rare and attained with great difficulty? Those that want\nhappiness need not meddle with the Brahma _n_ as.\n\n\n\np. 281\n\n\n\n15-16. Prahlada said :-- Blunt headed and vain braggarts are you! When I am\npresent in this Tirtha, I who am the upholder of Dharma, I won`t allow you to\npractise any irreligious things here! O Ascetics! Better show me your skill in\nfight to-day.\n\n\n\n17-18. Vyasa said :-- O king! The Ri _s_ i Nara on hearing his words replied\n:-- Give us battle if you are so desirous. O wretched amongst the Asuras! In\nto-day's battle, I will knock your head down, and then you shall never in\nfuture desire to fight with any body.\n\n\n\n19-20. Vyasa said :-- On hearing these words, the chief of the Daityas was\nvery much angry and promised to conquer these two self controlled Ri _s_ i\nascetics, Nara Naraya _n_ a by any means whatsoever.\n\n\n\n21-22. Vyasa said :-- Thus saying, the Daitya took up his bow and quickly\nstretched it with arrow and the bow string made a terrible noise. Then Nara,\ntoo, too up with anger his bows and began to shoot arrows at Prahlada lots of\nsharpened arrows and weapons.\n\n\n\n23\\. The lord of the Daityas quickly selected the arrows, glittering like\ngold, and with them tore asunder the arrows thrown by Nara. Nara, seeing his\narrows, cut asunder, became infuriated with anger and began to hurl as quickly\nlots of other arrows.\n\n\n\n24\\. Prahlada then cut asunder with arrows, of quick velocity, the Nara's\nweapons and struck violently on the breast of Nara. Nara, too, with anger\npierced the arms of Prahlada with five quick arrows.\n\n\n\n25\\. Indra and the other Devas came on their respective aeroplanes to see\ntheir fight and began to give cheers sometimes to Nara and sometime to\nPrahlada from above the skies.\n\n\n\n26\\. The Lord of the Daityas taking up his bow, began out of furious anger to\nhurl various weapons on Nara as incessantly as clouds give rain over the\nmountain peaks. The Nara Muni now became very much exhausted and weary, being\nstruck with Prahlada's arrows.\n\n\n\n27\\. Naraya _n_ a then seeing Nara exhausted, became very much amazed and\nbolding his unequalled S'arnga bow, began to quit arrows, shining with with\ngolden lustre.\n\n\n\n28\\. O Lord of the earth! Then Naraya _n_ a and Prahlada both were desirous to\nwin the victory, and a terrible fight ensued. The Devas gladly poured forth\nflowers on their heads from the skies.\n\n\n\n29\\. The king of the Daityas got very much enraged and began to hurl arrows\nwith tremendous quickness. Naraya _n_ a, the son of Dharma, immediately cut\nasunder those weapons with his very sharp arrow.\n\n\n\np. 282\n\n\n\n30-32. Naraya _n_ a too, threw arrows sharpened under stones with high\nvelocity and very much troubled the lord of the Daityas, who now became very\nmuch restless.\n\n\n\n33-34. The sky was covered over with arrows and arrows from both the parties\nand the day looked like the night. Then the Devas and the Daityas were very\nmuch astonished and told each other, \xc2\x93We never saw before a terrible fight\nlike this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n35\\. Then the Devar _s_ is, Gandarbhas, Yak _s_ as, Kinnaras, Pannagas,\nVidyadharas and Chara _n_ as were all very much confounded.\n\n\n\n36-37. The two Ri _s_ is Narada and Parvata came also to witness their fight;\nthe Devar _s_ i Narada told the Parvata Ri _s_ i he never saw before such a\ndreadful fight. There were awful battles with Tarakasura and Vritrasura and\nalso the battle between Hari and Madhukai _t_ ava; but they were all inferior\nand cannot stand in comparison.\n\n\n\n38\\. It seemed that Prahlada was very powerful; otherwise how could an equal\nfight last so long a time with such an accomplished person, perfect with all\nthe supernatural powers and of such heroic deeds as Naraya _n_ a.\n\n\n\n39-42. Vyasa said :-- O king! Day and night the Daityas and the ascetic Naraya\n_n_ a went on fighting terribly with each other. Then Naraya _n_ a cut off,\nwith the arrow, the bow of Prahlada; Prahlada soon took another bow; the\nexpert handed Naraya _n_ a quickly broke into two that bow. Thus though\nPrahlada's arrows were repeatedly cut asunder still he began to take up fresh\nbows and Naraya _n_ a began to cut them repeatedly.\n\n\n\n43-44. Thus, then, when all the bows of Prahlada were destroyed, the Daitya\nRaja took up Parigha (iron club), became enraged and threw it on Narayana's\narm. The powerful Bhagavan Narayana, seeing the dreadful iron club, cut it\nasunder with nine arrows and pierced Prahlada with ten arrows.\n\n\n\n45-47. Then Prahlada, enraged, threw the iron gada on Naraya _n_ a's thighs.\nThe exceedingly powerful Dharma's son was not at all agitated and stood firm\nlike a rock and taking up arrows quickly cut asunder the iron gada of the\nDaitya. Then the visitors were much startled.\n\n\n\n48-49. Then Prahlada, intent on killing his enemy, became very much angry and\nthrew the S\xc2\x92akti darts, spears and missiles instantly on Naraya _n_ a's thighs\nwith great velocity. Naraya _n_ a with one arrow cut that easily into seven\nparts and with seven arrows pierced Prahlada.\n\n\n\n50\\. Thus for one thousand Deva years the terrible fight lasted between\nPrahlada and Naraya _n_ a in that hermitage; and the whole universe was struck\nwith surprise.\n\n\n\np. 283\n\n\n\n51-52. Then Gadadhara with yellow robes and four hands quickly came there and\ncalled Prahlada. The son of Hira _n_ ya Kas'ipoo, Prahlada, seeing the Lord of\nLak _s_ mi, four armed, Naraya _n_ a with lotus and disc in His hands come\nthere, bowed low, and, with folded hands, began to speak to him with great\ndevotion.\n\n\n\n53-54. O Deva of the Devas! You are the Lord of the universe and devoted to\nyour devotees. O Madhava! I have fought for full one hundred Deva years; still\nI have not not been able to defeat these ascetics. I do not know why. I am\nsurprised at it.\n\n\n\n55-56. Vi _sn_ u said :-- O Forgiving One! These two Ri _s_ is Nara Naraya _n_\na are, the perfect ascetics, self controlled and born of my Amsas. Therefore\nyou have not been able to defeat them. What wonder is there! O king! Better go\nnow to your Patala and keep your steadfast devotion on me. O Intelligent one!\nDo not quarrel any more with these two ascetics.\n\n\n\n57\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! The Daitya king Prahlada then advised by Vi _sn_ u\nwent out of that place with his Asura followers; and the two Nara Naraya _n_\nas began again to practise their Tapasyas.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Ninth Chapter of the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam,\nthe Maha Pura _n_ am; of 18,000 verses, on the fight between the Ri _s_ is and\nPrahlada by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk04ch10.htm)\n\n"
