Narada said :-- I am now desirous to hear about the merits acquired by\nmaking gifts of land, the demerits in stealing away lands, digging wells in\nother's wells, in digging earth on the day of Ambuvachi, in casting semen on\nearth, and in placing lamps and lights on the surface of the earth as well the\nsins when one acts wrongly in various other ways on the surface of the earth\nand the remedies thereof.\n\n\n\n4-30. S\xc2\x92ri Narayana said :-- If one makes a gift of land in this Bharata of\nthe measure of a Vitasti (a long span measured by the extended thumb and\nlittle finger) to a Brahma _n_ a who performs Sandhya three times a day and is\nthus purified, one goes and remains in S\xc2\x92iva Loka (the abode of S\xc2\x92iva). If one\ngives away in charity a land full of corn to a Brahmi _n_ , the giver goes and\nlives in Vi _sn_ u Loka in the end for a period measured by the number of dust\nparticles in the land. If one presents a village, a plot of land, or grains to\na Brahmi _n_ , both the giver and the receiver, become freed of their sins and\ngo to the Devi Loka (the abode of the Devi). Even if one be present when a\nproposal for a gift of land is being made and says \xc2\x93This act is good,\xc2\x94 one\ngoes to Vaiku _nt_ ha with one's friends and relatives. He remains in the\nKalasutra hell as long as the Sun and Moon exist, who takes back or steals\naway the gift to a Brahmi _n_ , offered by himself or by any other body. Even\nhis sons, grandsons, etc., become destitute of lands, prosperity, sons, and\nwealth and remain in a dreadful hell named Raurava. If one cultivates the\ngrazing land for the cows and reaps therefrom a harvest of grains, one remains\nfor one hundred divine years in the Kumbhipaka hell. If one cultivates any\nenclosure for cows or tanks and grows grains on them, one remains in the\nAsipatra hell for a period equivalent to fourteen Indra's falls. One who\nbathes in another's tank without taking off five handfuls of earth from it,\ngoes to hell and one's bath is quite ineffectual. If anybody, out of his\namorous passion casts his semen privately on the suface of the ground, he will\nhave to suffer the torments of hell for as many years as are the numbers of\ndust particles on that area. If anyone digs ground on the day of Ambuvachi,\none remains in hell for four Yugas. If, without the permission of the owner of\na well or tank, a stupid man clears the old well or tank and digs\n\n\n\np. 845\n\n\n\nthe slushy earth from the bottom, his labour goes in vain. The merit goes to\nthe real owner. And the man who laboured so much goes to Tapta Ku _nd_ a\nNaraka for fourteen Indra's life-periods. If any one takes out five handfuls\nof earth from another's tank, when he goes to bathe in it, he dwells in Brahma\nLoka for a period of years amounting to the number of particles in those\nhandfuls of earth. During one's father's or grandfather's S'radha ceremony, if\none offers pi _nd_ a without offering any food (pi _nd_ a) to the owner of the\nsoil, the S'radha performer goes certainly to hell. If one places a light\n(Pradipa) directly on the earth without any holding piece at the bottom, one\nbecomes blind for seven births; and so if one places a conch-shell on the\nground (S'ankha), one becomes attacked with leprosy in one's next birth. If\nany body places pearls, gems, diamonds, gold and jewels, the five precious\nthings on the ground he becomes blind, if one places the phallic emblem of\nS\xc2\x92iva, the image of S'ivani, the S'alagrama stone on the ground, he remains\nfor one hundred Manvantaras to be eaten by worms. Conchshells, Yantras\n(diagrams for S'akti worshippers), the water after washing S'ilas (stones) i.\ne., Chara _n_ amrita, flowers, Tulasi leaves, if placed on the ground, lead\nhim who places these, verily to hells. The beads, garlands of flowers,\nGorochana (a bright yellow pigment prepared from the urine or bile of a cow),\nand camphor, when placed on the ground, lead him who places so to suffer the\ntorments of hell. The sandal wood, Rudrak _s_ a mala, and the roots of Kus'a\ngrass also, if placed on the ground, lead the doer to stay for one manvantara\nin the hell. Books, the sacred Upanayana threads, when placed on the ground\nmake the doers unfit for Brahmi _n_ birth; rather he is involved in a sin\nequivalent to the murder of a Brahmi _n_. The sacred Upanayana thread when\nknotted and rendered fit for holding, is worth being worshipped by all the\ncastes. One ought to sprinkle the earth with curd, milk, etc., after one has\ncompleted one's sacrifices. If one fails to do this, one will have to remain\nfor seven births in a hot ground with great torment. If one digs the earth\nwhen there is an earth quake or when there is an eclipse, that sinner becomes\nalso devoid of some of his limbs in his next birth. O Muni! This earth is\nnamed Bhumi since She is the abode of all; she is named Kas'yapi since she is\nthe daughter of Kas'yapa; is named Vis'vambhara, since she supports the\nUniverse; She is named Ananta, since she is endlessly wide; and She is named\nPrithivi since she is the daughter of the King Prithu, or she is extensively\nwide.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Tenth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the offences caused towards\nthe surface of the earth and punishments thereof\n\n\n\np. 846\n\n\n\nin hells - in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk09ch11.htm)\n\n"
