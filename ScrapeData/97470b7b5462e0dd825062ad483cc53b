Vyasa said :-- O King! On the Daitya Tamra becoming unconscious Mahi _s_\na became very angry and, raising his Gada (club), came up before the Devas and\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93Devas! O Ye powerless like crows; wait; with one stroke of Gada, I\nwill kill you.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the powerful Mahi _s_ a swelled with pride,\nseeing Indra before him mounted on his elephant instantly struck him on his\narms. Indra, again lost no time, and struck violently with his thunderbolt and\ncut the Danava's Gada into pieces, and came up very close, wanting to strike\nat him. Mahi _s_ a, too, becoming very angry took up his lustrous sword and\ncame to Indra to attack him with this weapon. A fight then occurred between\nthe two, terrible to all the Lokas and wonderful to the Munis, where various\nweapons were showered from both the sides. The Demon Mahi _s_ a spread then\nhis S'amvari Maya, destructive to all the worlds and fascinating to the Munis.\n\n\n\np. 370\n\n\n\nHundreds and hundreds of powerful buffalo-like appearances resembling Mahi _s_\na became, then, visible on the battle-field; they all began to kill the Deva\nforces with weapons in their hands.\n\n\n\n9-14. Seeing this magic of the Danava, Indra became thunderstruck and very\nmuch confounded with terror. Varu _n_ a, Kuvera, the Lord of wealth, Yama,\nFire, Moon, Sun, and other Devas all fled with terror. Indra then, being\nsurrounded by the network of magic, began to call Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and\nMahes'a in his mind. At the instant when they were called in mind, Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a riding on respective conveyances Swan, Garu _d_ a, and\nBull, came up there with best weapons in their hands for Indra's protection.\nVi _sn_ u seeing the play of that fascinating magic hurled his bright discus,\nSudars'an; and caused the magic to vanish at once. Seeing the three, the\nCreator, the Preserver, and the Destroyer, the Danava Mahi _s_ a came up there\nwith his Parigha (a club tipped with iron) weapon, desirous to fight with\nthem.\n\n\n\n15-16. Then the general Chik _s_ ura, Ugrasya, Ugravirya, Asiloma, Trinetra,\nVaskala, Andhaka and other warriors came up to fight.\n\n\n\n17-23. Those Proud Danavas, clad in armour and mounted on chariots with bows\nin their hands besieged the Devas, like a tiger attacking an heifer. Then\nthose Danavas swelled with pride began to shower on arrows after arrows; the\nDevas, too, began to do the same, desiring to extirpate them.The General\nAndhaka, coming up to Hari, drew his bow with great force up to his ear and\nshot at him five sharp arrows tipped with poison. Vasudeva, the Destroyer of\nthe enemies, cut off those arrows no sooner they came up before him; and He\nshot at the Danavas five arrows. Then Hari and the Danava struck each other\nwith various weapons and arrows, swords, discus, Mu _s_ ala, clubs, S\xc2\x92akti,\nand Paras'u. Here, on the other hand, the fight lasted for fifty days between\nMahes'a versus Andhaka; and it was a very close conflict, causing\nhorripilation. Thus severe fights ensued between Vaskala and Indra, Mahi _s_ a\nand Rudra, Trinetra and Yama, Maha Hanu and Kuvera, Asiloma and Varu _n_ a.\n\n\n\n24-39. The Danava Mahi _s_ a struck Garu _d_ a, the conveyance of Hari, with\nhis club; Garu _d_ a, being very much distressed with the blow, sat down,\ngasping. Vi _sn_ u then comforted the powerful Garu _d_ a, the son of Vinata\nand made him calm and quiet. Wanting to kill Andhaka, Janardana became\ninfuriated, and, drawing his bow made of horn, call S'arnga, shot at him\narrows after arrows. The Danava cut off all those arrows to pieces with his\nown mass of arrows. Then, becoming very angry, he shot fifty sharp arrows at\nHari. Vasudeva quickly made all those arrows useless\n\n\n\np. 371\n\n\n\nand hurled Sudars'ana Chakra with thousand spokes on the Danava with great\nviolence. Andhaka thwarted this with his own discus and shouted aloud with\nsuch a great force that all the Devas became confused and confounded. Vi _sn_\nu's Chakra being baffled, the Devas became distressed with grief and the\nDanavas got elated. Seeing the Devas thus grieved, Vi _sn_ u held aloft his\nKaumodaki Gada (club) and came hurriedly before the Danava. Hari struck then\nwith his Gada on the Danava's head whereon he fell senseless on the ground.\nThe hot-tempered Mahi _s_ a, seeing Andhaka senseless, bellowed aloud and,\nterrifying Hari, came up there. Seeing him there, Vasudeva made such a\nthundering noise with his bow string that the Devas became highly glad. Then\nthe Bhagavan shot showers of arrows on Mahi _s_ a; and Mahi _s_ a, too, cut\nthose arrows while they were seen in the air. O king! Then a very close fight\nensued between the two, Kes'ava struck on the head of the Danava with his\nclub. Thus struck, he fell in a swoon on the ground and a general cry of\ndistress arose amongst the Danavas. In a moment the Danava got up again, free\nfrom trouble; he then struck again on Vi _sn_ u's head with his Parigha (a\nclub mounted with iron, a mace). Struck by that mace, Janardan lay senseless;\nGaru _d_ a, seeing him thus unconscious, immediately took him away from the\nbattle field.\n\n\n\n40-55. When Vi _sn_ u thus fled, Indra and the Devas were much distressed with\nfear and began to cry aloud. Hearing the Devas cry, S'ankara became wrathful\nand, quickly coming before Mahi _s_ a, struck him with his trident (S'ula).\nThe wicked Mahi _s_ a made his weapon ineffectual and bellowed aloud and\nstruck on the breast of S'ankara with his S\xc2\x92akti (a kind of missile). Thus\nwounded in his breast S'ankara did not feel any pain; rather, with his eyes\nred with anger, He struck him again with Trisula. Seeing S'ankara engaged with\nMahi _s_ a, Hari becoming conscious came again on the battle-field. Seeing the\ntwo powerful Deva-chiefs, Hari and Hara, in the battle-field Mahi _s_ a became\nvery much angry: he then assumed a buffalo body and wagging his tail to and\nfro came in front of them with a desire to fight. That terrible Mahi _s_ a of\na huge body shook his horns and bellowed so deep like a thunder cloud that\neven the Devas got frightened. He began to hurl the huge mountain peaks with\nhis two horns. The two powerful Devas Hari and Hara, began to shoot at the\nDanava deadly arrows after arrows. Seeing these two gods shower arrows upon\nhim, Mahi _s_ a began to hurl mountains on them by his tail. Vi _sn_ u cut off\nthose mountains into hundred pieces by his arrow; and struck at him instantly\nwith his Chakra. Struck thus by Chakra, the Lord of the Danavas fainted, but\nhe instantly rose up with a human body. The mountain-like terrible Danava with\n\n\n\np. 372\n\n\n\na club in his hand frightened the Devas and uttered grave sounds like those of\nrumbling rain clouds. Hearing that, the Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u sounded a more\nterrible sound with his Pa\xc3\xb1chajanya S'a _n_ kha (conchshell). Hearing the\nsound of that conchshell, the Danavas were struck with terror and the ascetic\nRi _s_ is and Devas became exalted with joy.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixth Chapter of the Fifth Skandha on the Deva Danava fight in\nS'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 versus by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7](bk05ch07.htm)\n\n"
