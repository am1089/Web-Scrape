Alas! To what a state am I reduced!\n\nI once assumed the staff of reed  \n  For custom\'s sake alone,  \nAs officer to guard at need  \n  The ladies round the throne.  \nBut years have passed away and made  \nIt serve, my tottering steps to aid.\n\n[paragraph continues] The king is within. I will tell him of the urgent\nbusiness which demands his attention. ( _He takes a few steps_.) But what is\nthe business? ( _He recalls it_.) Yes, I remember. Certain hermits, pupils of\nKanva, desire to see his Majesty. Strange, strange!\n\nThe mind of age is like a lamp  \n  Whose oil is running thin;  \nOne moment it is shining bright,  \n  Then darkness closes in.\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _He walks and looks about_.) Here is his Majesty.\n\nHe does not seek--until a father\'s care  \n  Is shown his subjects--rest in solitude;  \nAs a great elephant reeks not of the sun  \n  Until his herd is sheltered in the wood.\n\n[paragraph continues] In truth, I hesitate to announce the coming of Kanva\'s\npupils to the king. For he has this moment risen from the throne of justice.\nBut kings are never weary. For\n\nThe sun unyokes his horses never;  \n  Blows night and day the breeze;  \nShesha upholds the world forever:  \n  And kings are like to these.\n\n( _He walks about. Enter the king, the clown, and retinue according to rank_.)\n\np. 52\n\n_King_ ( _betraying the cares of office_ ). Every one is happy on attaining\nhis desire--except a king. His difficulties increase with his power. Thus:\n\nSecurity slays nothing but ambition;  \n  With great possessions, troubles gather thick;  \nPain grows, not lessens, with a king\'s position,  \n  As when one\'s hand must hold the sunshade\'s stick.\n\n_Two court poets behind the scenes_. Victory to your Majesty.\n\n_First poet_.\n\nThe world you daily guard and bless,  \nNot heeding pain or weariness;  \n  Thus is your nature made.  \nA tree will brave the noonday, when  \nThe sun is fierce, that weary men  \n  May rest beneath its shade.\n\n_Second poet_.\n\nVice bows before the royal rod;  \nStrife ceases at your kingly nod;  \n  You are our strong defender.  \nFriends come to all whose wealth is sure,  \nBut you, alike to rich and poor,  \n  Are friend both strong and tender.\n\n_King_ ( _listening_ ). Strange! I was wearied by the demands of my office,\nbut this renews my spirit.\n\n_Clown_. Does a bull forget that he is tired when you call him the leader of\nthe herd?\n\n_King_ ( _smiling_ ). Well, let us sit down. ( _They seat themselves, and the\nretinue arranges itself. A lute is heard behind the scenes_.)\n\n_Clown_ ( _listening_ ). My friend, listen to what is going on in the music-\nroom. Some one is playing a lute, and keeping good time. I suppose Lady\nHansavati is practising.\n\n_King_. Be quiet. I wish to listen.\n\n_Chamberlain_ ( _looks at the king_ ). Ah, the king is occupied. I must await\nhis leisure. ( _He stands aside_.)\n\n_A song behind the scenes_.\n\nYou who kissed the mango-flower,  \nHoney-loving bee,  \nGave her all your passion\'s power,  \nAh, so tenderly! p. 53\n\nHow can you be tempted so  \nBy the lily, pet?  \nFresher honey \'s sweet, I know;  \nBut can you forget?\n\n_King_. What an entrancing song!\n\n_Clown_. But, man, don\'t you understand what the words mean?\n\n_King_ ( _smiling_ ). I was once devoted to Queen Hansavati. And the rebuke\ncomes from her. Friend Madhavya, tell Queen Hansavati in my name that the\nrebuke is a very pretty one.\n\n_Clown_. Yes, sir. ( _He rises_.) But, man, you are using another fellow\'s\nfingers to grab a bear\'s tail-feathers with. I have about as much chance of\nsalvation as a monk who hasn\'t forgotten his passions.\n\n_King_. Go. Soothe her like a gentleman.\n\n_Clown_. I suppose I must. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). Why am I filled with wistfulness on hearing such a\nsong? I am not separated from one I love.\n\nAnd yet\n\nIn face of sweet presentment  \n  Or harmonies of sound,  \nMan e\'er forgets contentment,  \n  By wistful longings bound.\n\nThere must be recollections  \n  Of things not seen on earth,  \nDeep nature\'s predilections,  \n  Loves earlier than birth.\n\n[paragraph continues] (He shows the wistfulness that comes from unremembered\nthings.)\n\n_Chamberlain_ ( _approaching_ ). Victory to your Majesty. Here are hermits who\ndwell in the forest at the foot of the Himalayas. They bring women with them,\nand they carry a message from Kanva. What is your pleasure with regard to\nthem?\n\n_King_ ( _astonished_ ). Hermits? Accompanied by women? From Kanva?\n\n_Chamberlain_. Yes.\n\n_King_. Request my chaplain Somarata in my name to\n\np. 54\n\nreceive these hermits in the manner prescribed by Scripture, and to conduct\nthem himself before me. I will await them in a place fit for their reception.\n\n_Chamberlain_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_King_ ( _rising_ ). Vetravati, conduct me to the fire-sanctuary.\n\n_Portress_. Follow me, your Majesty. ( _She walks about_.) Your Majesty, here\nis the terrace of the fire-sanctuary. It is beautiful, for it has just been\nswept, and near at hand is the cow that yields the milk of sacrifice. Pray\nascend it.\n\n_King_ ( _ascends and stands leaning on the shoulder of an attendant_.)\nVetravati, with what purpose does Father Kanva send these hermits to me?\n\nDo leagued powers of sin conspire  \nTo balk religion\'s pure desire?  \nHas wrong been done to beasts that roam  \nContented round the hermits\' home?  \nDo plants no longer bud and flower,  \nTo warn me of abuse of power?  \nThese doubts and more assail my mind,  \nBut leave me puzzled, lost, and blind.\n\n_Portress_. How could these things be in a hermitage that rests in the fame of\nthe king\'s arm? No, I imagine they have come to pay homage to their king, and\nto congratulate him on his pious rule.\n\n( _Enter the chaplain and the chamberlain, conducting the two pupils of_\nKANVA, _With_ GAUTAMI _and_ SHAKUNTALA.)\n\n_Chamberlain_. Follow me, if you please.\n\n_Sharngarava_. Friend Sharadvata,\n\nThe king is noble and to virtue true;  \n  None dwelling here commit the deed of shame;  \nYet we ascetics view the worldly crew  \n  As in a house all lapped about with flame.\n\n_Sharadvata_. Sharngarava, your emotion on entering the city is quite just. As\nfor me,\n\nFree from the world and all its ways,  \nI see them spending worldly days  \nAs clean men view men smeared with oil,  \nAs pure men, those whom passions soil,  \nAs waking men view men asleep,  \nAs free men, those in bondage deep.\n\np. 55\n\n_Chaplain_. That is why men like you are great.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _observing an evil omen_ ). Oh, why does my right eye throb?\n\n_Gautami_. Heaven avert the omen, my child. May happiness wait upon you. (\n_They walk about_.)\n\n_Chaplain_ ( _indicating the king_ ). O hermits, here is he who protects those\nof every station and of every age. He has already risen, and awaits you.\nBehold him.\n\n_Sharngarava_. Yes, it is admirable, but not surprising. For\n\nFruit-laden trees bend down to earth;  \n  The water-pregnant clouds hang low;  \nGood men are not puffed up by power  \n  The unselfish are by nature so.\n\n_Portress_. Your Majesty, the hermits seem to be happy. They give you gracious\nlooks.\n\n_King_ ( _observing_ SHAKUNTALA). Ah!\n\nWho is she, shrouded in the veil  \n  That dims her beauty\'s lustre,  \nAmong the hermits like a flower  \n  Round which the dead leaves cluster?\n\n_Portress_. Your Majesty, she is well worth looking at.\n\n_King_. Enough! I must not gaze upon another\'s wife.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _laying her hand on her breast. Aside_ ). Oh, my heart, why\ntremble so? Remember his constant love and be brave.\n\n_Chaplain_ ( _advancing_ ). Hail, your Majesty. The hermits have been received\nas Scripture enjoins. They have a message from their teacher. May you be\npleased to hear it.\n\n_King_ ( _respectfully_ ). I am all attention.\n\n_The two pupils_ ( _raising their right hands_ ). Victory, O King.\n\n_King_ ( _bowing low_ ). I salute you all.\n\n_The two pupils_. All hail.\n\n_King_. Does your pious life proceed without disturbance?\n\n_The two pupils_.\n\nHow could the pious duties fail  \n  While you defend the right?  \nOr how could darkness\' power prevail  \n  O\'er sunbeams shining bright?\n\np. 56\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). Indeed, my royal title is no empty one. ( _Aloud_.)\nIs holy Kanva in health?\n\n_Sharngarava_. O King, those who have religious power can command health. He\nasks after your welfare and sends this message.\n\n_King_. What are his commands?\n\n_Sharngarava_. He says: "Since you have met this my daughter and have married\nher, I give you my glad consent. For\n\nYou are the best of worthy men, they say;  \n  And she, I know, Good Works personified;  \nThe Creator wrought for ever and a day,  \n  In wedding such a virtuous groom and bride.\n\n[paragraph continues] She is with child. Take her and live with her in\nvirtue."\n\n_Gautami_. Bless you, sir. I should like to say that no one invites me to\nspeak.\n\n_King_. Speak, mother.\n\n_Gautami_.\n\nDid she with father speak or mother?  \n  Did you engage her friends in speech?  \nYour faith was plighted each to other;  \n  Let each be faithful now to each.\n\n_Shakuntala_. What will my husband say?\n\n_King_ ( _listening with anxious suspicion_ ). What is this insinuation?\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _to herself_ ). Oh, oh! So haughty and so slanderous!\n\n_Sharngarava_. "What is this insinuation?" What is your question? Surely you\nknow the world\'s ways well enough.\n\nBecause the world suspects a wife  \n  Who does not share her husband\'s lot,  \nHer kinsmen wish her to abide  \n  With him, although he love her not.\n\n_King_. You cannot mean that this young woman is my wife.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _sadly to herself_ ). Oh, my heart, you feared it, and now it\nhas come.\n\np. 57\n\n_Sharngarava_. O King,\n\nA king, and shrink when love is done,  \n  Turn coward\'s back on truth, and flee!\n\n_King_. What means this dreadful accusation?\n\n_Sharngarava_ ( _furiously_ ).\n\nO drunk with power! We might have known  \n  That you were steeped in treachery.\n\n_King_. A stinging rebuke!\n\n_Gautami_ ( _to_ SHAKUNTALA). Forget your shame, my child. I will remove your\nveil. Then your husband will recognise you. ( _She does so_.)\n\n_King_ ( _observing_ SHAKUNTALA. _To himself_ ).\n\nAs my heart ponders whether I could ever  \nHave wed this woman that has come to me  \nIn tortured loveliness, as I endeavour  \nTo bring it back to mind, then like a bee\n\nThat hovers round a jasmine flower at dawn,  \nWhile frosty dews of morning still o\'erweave it,  \nAnd hesitates to sip ere they be gone,  \nI cannot taste the sweet, and cannot leave it.\n\n_Portress_ ( _to herself_ ). What a virtuous king he is! Would any other man\nhesitate when he saw such a pearl of a woman coming of her own accord?\n\n_Sharngarava_. Have you nothing to say, O King?\n\n_King_. Hermit, I have taken thought. I cannot believe that this woman is my\nwife. She is plainly with child. How can I take her, confessing myself an\nadulterer?\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _to herself_ ). Oh, oh, oh! He even casts doubt on our\nmarriage. The vine of my hope climbed high, but it is broken now.\n\n_Sharngarava_. Not so.\n\nYou scorn the sage who rendered whole  \n  His child befouled, and choked his grief,  \nWho freely gave you what you stole  \n  And added honour to a thief!\n\n_Sharadvata_. Enough, Sharngarava. Shakuntala, we have\n\np. 58\n\nsaid what we were sent to say. You hear his words. Answer him.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _to herself_ ). He loved me so. He is so changed. Why remind\nhim? Ah, but I must clear my own character. Well, I will try. ( _Aloud_.) My\ndear husband--( _She stops_.) No, he doubts my right to call him that. Your\nMajesty, it was pure love that opened my poor heart to you in the hermitage.\nThen you were kind to me and gave me your promise. Is it right for you to\nspeak so now, and to reject me?\n\n_King_ ( _stopping his ears_ ). Peace, peace!\n\nA stream that eats away the bank,  \n  Grows foul, and undermines the tree.  \nSo you would stain your honour, while  \n  You plunge me into misery.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Very well. If you have acted so because you really fear to touch\nanother man\'s wife, I will remove your doubts with a token you gave me.\n\n_King_. An excellent idea!\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _touching her finger_ ). Oh, oh! The ring is lost. ( _She looks\nsadly at_ GAUTAMI.)\n\n_Gautami_. My child, you worshipped the holy Ganges at the spot where Indra\ndescended. The ring must have fallen there.\n\n_King_. Ready wit, ready wit!\n\n_Shakuntala_. Fate is too strong for me there. I will tell you something else.\n\n_King_. Let me hear what you have to say.\n\n_Shakuntala_. One day, in the bower of reeds, you were holding a lotus-leaf\ncup full of water.\n\n_King_. I hear you.\n\n_Shakuntala_. At that moment the fawn came up, my adopted son. Then you took\npity on him and coaxed him. "Let him drink first," you said. But he did not\nknow you, and he would not come to drink water from your hand. But he liked it\nafterwards, when I held the very same water. Then you smiled and said: "It is\ntrue. Every one trusts his own sort. You both belong to the forest."\n\n_King_. It is just such women, selfish, sweet, false, that entice fools.\n\np. 59\n\n_Gautami_. You have no right to say that. She grew up in the pious grove. She\ndoes not know how to deceive.\n\n_King_. Old hermit woman,\n\nThe female\'s untaught cunning may be seen  \n  In beasts, far more in women selfish-wise;  \nThe cuckoo\'s eggs are left to hatch and rear  \n  By foster-parents, and away she flies.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _angrily_ ). Wretch! You judge all this by your own false\nheart. Would any other man do what you have done? To hide behind virtue, like\na yawning well covered over with grass!\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). But her anger is free from coquetry, because she has\nlived in the forest. See!\n\nHer glance is straight; her eyes are flashing red;  \nHer speech is harsh, not drawlingly well-bred;  \nHer whole lip quivers, seems to shake with cold;  \nHer frown has straightened eyebrows arching bold.\n\n[paragraph continues] No, she saw that I was doubtful, and her anger was\nfeigned. Thus\n\nWhen I refused but now  \n  Hard-heartedly, to know  \nOf love or secret vow,  \n  Her eyes grew red; and so,  \nBending her arching brow,  \n  She fiercely snapped Love\'s bow.\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _Aloud_.) My good girl, Dushyanta\'s conduct is known\nto the whole kingdom, but not this action.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Well, well. I had my way. I trusted a king, and put myself in\nhis hands. He had a honey face and a heart of stone. (She covers her face with\nher dress and weeps.)\n\n_Sharngarava_. Thus does unbridled levity burn.\n\nBe slow to love, but yet more slow  \n     With secret mate;  \nWith those whose hearts we do not know,  \n     Love turns to hate.\n\n_King_. Why do you trust this girl, and accuse me of an imaginary crime?\n\np. 60\n\n_Sharngarava_ ( _disdainfully_ ). You have learned your wisdom upside down.\n\nIt would be monstrous to believe  \n  A girl who never lies;  \nTrust those who study to deceive  \n  And think it very wise.\n\n_King_. Aha, my candid friend! Suppose I were to admit that I am such a man.\nWhat would happen if I deceived the girl?\n\n_Sharngarava_. Ruin.\n\n_King_. It is unthinkable that ruin should fall on Puru\'s line.\n\n_Sharngarava_. Why bandy words? We have fulfilled our Father\'s bidding. We are\nready to return.\n\nLeave her or take her, as you will;  \n     She is your wife;  \nHusbands have power for good or ill  \n     O\'er woman\'s life.\n\n[paragraph continues] Gautami, lead the way. ( _They start to go_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_. He has deceived me shamelessly. And will you leave me too? (\n_She starts to follow_.)\n\n_Gautami_ ( _turns around and sees her_ ). Sharngarava, my son, Shakuntala is\nfollowing us, lamenting piteously. What can the poor child do with a husband\nbase enough to reject her?\n\n_Sharngarava_ ( _turns angrily_ ). You self-willed girl! Do you dare show\nindependence? (SHAKUNTALA _shrinks in fear_.) Listen.\n\nIf you deserve such scorn and blame,  \nWhat will your father with your shame?  \nBut if you know your vows are pure,  \nObey your husband and endure.\n\n[paragraph continues] Remain. We must go.\n\n_King_. Hermit, why deceive this woman? Remember:\n\nNight-blossoms open to the moon,  \n  Day-blossoms to the sun;  \nA man of honour ever strives  \n  Another\'s wife to shun.\n\np. 61\n\n_Sharngarava_. O King, suppose you had forgotten your former actions in the\nmidst of distractions. Should you now desert your wife--you who fear to fail\nin virtue?\n\n_King_. I ask _you_ which is the heavier sin:\n\nNot knowing whether I be mad  \n  Or falsehood be in her,  \nShall I desert a faithful wife  \n  Or turn adulterer?\n\n_Chaplain_ ( _considering_ ). Now if this were done------\n\n_King_. Instruct me, my teacher.\n\n_Chaplain_. Let the woman remain in my house until her child is born.\n\n_King_. Why this?\n\n_Chaplain_. The chief astrologers have told you that your first child was\ndestined to be an emperor. If the son of the hermit\'s daughter is born with\nthe imperial birthmarks, then welcome her and introduce her into the palace.\nOther- wise, she must return to her father.\n\n_King_. It is good advice, my teacher.\n\n_Chaplain_ ( _rising_ ). Follow me, my daughter.\n\n_Shakuntala_. O mother earth, give me a grave! ( _Exit weeping, with the\nchaplain, the hermits, and_ GAUTAMI. _The king, his memory clouded by the\ncurse, ponders on_ SHAKUNTALA.)\n\n_Voices behind the scenes_. A miracle! A miracle!\n\n_King_ ( _listening_ ). What does this mean? ( _Enter the chaplain_.)\n\n_Chaplain_ ( _in amazement_ ). Your Majesty, a wonderful thing has happened.\n\n_King_. What?\n\n_Chaplain_. When Kanva\'s pupils had departed,\n\nShe tossed her arms, bemoaned her plight,  \nAccused her crushing fate------\n\n_King_. What then?\n\n_Chaplain_.\n\nBefore our eyes a heavenly light  \nIn woman\'s form, but shining bright,  \n  Seized her and vanished straight.\n\n( _All betray astonishment_.)\n\n_King_. My teacher, we have already settled the matter. Why speculate in vain?\nLet us seek repose.\n\np. 62\n\n_Chaplain_. Victory to your Majesty. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_King_. Vetravati, I am bewildered. Conduct me to my apartment.\n\n_Portress_. Follow me, your Majesty.\n\n_King_ ( _walks about. To himself_ ).\n\nWith a hermit-wife I had no part,  \n  All memories evade me;  \nAnd yet my sad and stricken heart  \n  Would more than half persuade me.\n\n( _Exeunt omnes_.)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act VI.
