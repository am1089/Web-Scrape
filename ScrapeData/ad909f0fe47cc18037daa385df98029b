That noblest fire,  \nThe Sun, was great Sugriva's sire,  \nTara, the mighty monkey, he  \nWas offspring of Vrihaspati: 6  \nTara the matchless chieftain, boast  \nFor wisdom of the Vanar host.  \nOf Gandhamadan brave and bold  \nThe father was the Lord of Gold.  \nNala the mighty, dear to fame,  \nOf skilful Vis'vakarma 7 came.  \nFrom Agni, 8 Nila bright as flame,  \nWho in his splendour, might, and worth,  \nSurpassed the sire who gave him birth.  \n\nThe heavenly As'vlns, 1b swift and fair,  \nWere fathers of a noble pair,  \nWho, Dwivida and Mainda named,  \nFor beauty like their sires were famed,  \nVarun 2b was father of Sushen,  \nOf Sarabh, he who sends the rain, 3b  \nHanuman, best of monkey kind,  \nWas son of him who breathes the wind:  \nLike thunderbolt in frame was he,  \nAnd swift as Garud's 4b self could flee.  \nThese thousands did the Gods create  \nEndowed with might that none could mate,  \nIn monkey forms that changed at will;  \nSo strong their wish the fiend to kill.  \nIn mountain size, like lions thewed,  \nUp sprang the wondrous multitude,  \nAuxiliar hosts in every shape,  \nMonkey and bear and highland ape.  \nIn each the strength, the might, the mien  \nOf his own parent God were seen.  \nSome chiefs of Vanar mothers came,  \nSome of she-bear and minstrel dame,  \nSkilled in all arms in battle's shock;  \nThe brandished tree, the loosened rock;  \nAnd prompt, should other weapons fail,  \nTo fight and slay with tooth and nail.  \nTheir strength could shake the hills amain,  \nAnd rend the rooted trees in twain,  \nDisturb with their impetuous sweep  \nThe Rivers' Lord, the Ocean deep,  \nRend with their feet the seated ground,  \nAnd pass wide floods with airy bound,  \nOr forcing through the sky their way  \nThe very clouds by force could stay.  \nMad elephants that wander through  \nThe forest wilds, could they subdue,  \nAnd with their furious shout could scare  \nDead upon earth the birds of air.  \nSo were the sylvan chieftains formed;  \nThousands on thousands still they swarmed.  \nThese were the leaders honoured most,  \nThe captains of the Vanar host,  \nAnd to each lord and chief and guide  \nWas monkey offspring born beside.  \nThen by the bears' great monarch stood  \nThe other roamers of the wood,  \n\np. 29  \n\nAnd turned, their pathless homes to seek,  \nTo forest and to mountain peak.  \nThe leaders of the monkey band  \nBy the two brothers took their stand,  \nSugriva, offspring of the Sun.  \nAnd Bali, Indra's mighty one.  \nThey both endowed with Garud's might,  \nAnd skilled in all the arts of fight,  \nWandered in arms the forest through,  \nAnd lions, snakes, and tigers, slew.  \nBut every monkey, ape, and bear  \nEver was Bali's special care;  \nWith his vast strength and mighty arm  \nHe kept them from all scathe and harm.  \nAnd so the earth with hill, wood, seas,  \nWas filled with mighty ones like these,  \nOf various shape and race and kind,  \nWith proper homes to each assigned,  \nWith Rama's champions fierce and strong  \n   The earth was overspread,  \nHigh as the hills and clouds, a throng  \n   With bodies vast and dread.
