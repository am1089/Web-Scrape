Vyasa said :-- The Maha Maya, that Excellent Lady, hearing thus the\nwords of the prime minister of Mahi _s_ a, laughed and spoke with a voice,\ndeep like that of a cloud, thus :-- O Minister-in-chief! Know Me as the Mother\nof the gods; my name is Maha Lak _s_ mi. It is I that destroy all the Daityas.\nI am requested by all the Devas to kill Danava Mahi _s_ a; they have been\noppressed and deprived of their share of Yaj\xc3\xb1a offerings. Therefore I have\ncome here today alone, without any army to take away his life. O Good One! I\nam pleased with your sweet words of welcome, in showing me marks of respect.\nHad you not behaved thus, I would have certainly burnt you to ashes by my\nfiery sight, which is the universal conflagration at the break up of the\nworld. O Minister! Who is there that gets not pleased with sweet words! Go you\nto Mahi _s_ a and speak to him the following words of mine \xc2\x93O Villain! Go down\nto Patala (the nether regions) at once if you have any desire to live.\nOtherwise, I will slay you, the wicked one, in the battle-field; you will have\nto go to the house of Death, pierced by my mass of arrows. O Stupid One! Know\nthat this is merely kindness shown unto you, that I have told you to go soon\nto Patala and that the Devas get\n\n\n\np. 386\n\n\n\npossession of their Heaven, with no delay. O One of weak intellect! Therefore\ndost Thou leave possession of this sea-girt earth and go alone without any\ndelay to Patala, before my arrows are shot at you. O Asura! Or if you desire\nto fight, then come at once with your powerful warriors; I will destroy all of\nthem. O One of dull intellect! I will kill you in battle, just as I killed\nbefore in yugas after yugas countless Asuras like you. O Passionate creature!\nBetter shew that your efforts in holding weapons have been crowned with\nsuccess by your being engaged in battle against Me; otherwise they will all be\nuseless. O Stupid! You thought that you would be vulnerable alone to women\nhence you oppressed the Devas entitled to worship; O wicked one! No longer\nshow your pride on the strength of your getting the boon from Brahma, that you\nwould be vulnerable only to the females. Thinking it advisable to observe the\nwords of the Creator, I have assumed this incomparable Eternal Female\nappearance and I have come here to slay you, O wicked one! O stupid one! If\nyou have any desire for your life, then quit this Heaven and go to Patala,\ninfested with snakes, or anywhere else you like.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n17-28. Vyasa said :-- Hearing these words of the Devi, that minister,\nsurrounded by forces, replied in reasonable words thus :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! You are\nspeaking in words befitting a woman and puffed up with pride. You are a woman;\nthe lord of the Daityas is a hero; how can a battle be engaged between you\ntwo. It seems to me impossible. Your body is delicate, a girl in full youth;\nespecially you are alone and Mahi _s_ a is of huge body and powerful; so the\nfight comes next to impossibility. He has elephants, horses, chariots,\ninfantry, etc., and countless soldiers all armed with weapons. Therefore, O\nBeautiful One! He will find no difficulty in killing you in battle as an\nelephant finds no difficulty in treading over the Malati flowers. Rather, if I\nutter anything harsh to you, that would go against the sentiment of love, with\nyou; therefore I cannot speak rudely to you out of my fear not to interrupt\nthe above feeling. True, that our king is an enemy of the gods; but be has\nbecome extremely devoted to you. Therefore it is wise to speak words full of\nconciliation or generosity. Were it otherwise, I would have shot arrows at you\nand would have killed you in as much as you have thus boasted in vain and\nspoken so dire a falsehood, resting merely on the strength of your youthful\npride and cleverness. My master has become fascinated on hearing your\nextraordinary beauty hardly to be seen in this world; it therefore behoves me\nto speak sweet words to you for the sake of pleasing my master. O Large-eyed!\nThis kingdom and the wealth thereof are all yours; in fact, Mahi _s_ a will be\nyour obedient servant; therefore, better forsake your anger, leading\n\n\n\np. 387\n\n\n\nto your death; and cultivate friendship with him. O Sweet Smiling One! I am\nfalling at your feet; you better go to him and become at once queen-consort. O\nHandsome Woman! No sooner you become the queen of Mahi _s_ a than you will get\nat once all the pure wealth of the three worlds and the unbounding happiness\nof this world.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n29-45. The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93Minister! I now speak what is pregnant with goodness\nand wisdom to you, according to the rules of the S'astras, keeping in view\nalso the cleverness that you have shown in using your words. Now I come to\nunderstand from your talk, that you are the chief secretary of Mahi _s_ a; and\ntherefore your nature and intelligence are like those of a beast. And how can\nhe be intelligent, whose ministership is occupied by a man of your nature!\nNature has ordained connection between two persons of like nature. O Stupid\nOne! Did you think a little beforehand the meaning of your words when you told\nme of my feminine nature? Though I am not apparently a man, yet my nature is\nthat of the Highest Puru _s_ a (Man); I shew myself simply in a feminine form.\nYour master asked before from Brahma that he would prefer death, if possible,\nat the hands of a woman ; therefore, I consider him quite illiterate and\nignorant of the sentiment, worthy of a hero. Because to die at the hands of a\nwoman is very painful to one who is a hero; and this is gladly welcome to one\nwho is a hermaphrodite. Now see that your master Mahi _s_ a has shown his\nintelligence, when he courted his death from the hands of a woman. For that\nvery reason, I have come here in the shape of a woman to effect my purpose;\nwhy shall I fear, then, to hear your words, contradictory to those of the\nS'astras. When Fate goes against any one, a grass comes like a thunderbolt;\nand when fate goes in favour of anyone, a thunderbolt becomes as soft as a\nbundle of cotton. What does it avail even when one possesses an extensive army\nor various weapons in abundance, taking shelter in a wide extending fort? What\nwill his soldiers do to him, whose death has come close at hand? Whenever, in\ndue time, the connection of the Jiva (the human soul) with this body is\nbrought about, then his pleasures, pains and death are written. Know this as\ncertain, very certain, that death will come to him in the manner as written by\nthe hands of Fate; it will never be otherwise. As the birth and death of\nBrahma and other gods are ordained, your death has been similarly ordained;\nno, there is no need of taking the example further than this. Those who are\ntied up by the hands of death are surely fools and of extremely blunt\nintellect, if they think simply on the strength of their getting some boons\n\xc2\x93that they would never die.\xc2\x94 Therefore go quickly to your king and speak to\nhim what I have said; you will then surely obey what he commands you to do. If\nhe wants\n\n\n\np. 388\n\n\n\nhis life, he, with his retinue, would at once go down to Patala; let Indra and\nthe other Devas get possession of the Heavens and their share of Yaj\xc3\xb1as. If he\nholds a contrary opinion, let him be eager to go to the house of Death and\ncome and fight with Me. If he thinks that Vi _sn_ u and the other Devas have\nfled from the battle-fields, he has nothing to boast of; for he has not shewn\nhis manliness at all even then; for his victory is solely due to his having\ngot the boon from Brahma.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n46-52. Vyasa said :-- Hearing these words of the Devi, the Danava began to\nthink whether I ought to fight or to go to Mahi _s_ a? The King has become\nvery enamoured and has sent me hither to negotiate for marriage; how then will\nI be able to go to him if I make this affair unpleasant and interrupted in the\nmiddle in its course of harmony. Now it is wise for me to go to the King\nwithout fighting; let me then go as early as possible in this way and inform\nhim about this whole affair. The King is exceptionally intelligent and\nexperienced; he will consult with his other experienced ministers and do what\nis best. Therefore I ought not to fight here rashly; for victory or defeat\nwould alike be distasteful to my monarch. Whether this Lady kills me, or I\nkill this Lady, the king will be angry in either case. I will therefore go now\nto the king and tell him what the Devi has said; he will do whatever he likes.\n\n\n\n53-66. Vyasa said :-- Thus that intelligent son of the minister argued and\nwent to the king. Then, bowing down before him, he began to say thus :-- O\nKing! That excellent woman, fascinating to the world, the beautiful Devi is\nsitting on a lion with weapons in all her eighteen hands. O King! I told her\n\xc2\x93O Beautiful Lady! Be attached to Mahi _s_ asura; you will become, then, the\nqueen-consort of the king, the lord of the three worlds. You will certainly\nthen be his queen-consort; he will pass his life, ever obedient to you like an\nobedient servant. O Beautiful One! If you choose to make Mahi _s_ a your\nhusband, you will become fortunate amongst women and will enjoy ever all the\nwealth of the three worlds.\xc2\x94 Hearing my these words, that large-eyed woman,\npuffed up with egoism, laughed a little and said thus :-- \xc2\x93Your king is born\nof a buffalo and is the worst of brutes; I will sacrifice him before the Devi\nfor the benefit of the gods. Is there any woman in this world so stupid as to\nselect Mahi _s_ a as her husband? O You stupid! Can a woman like me ever\nindulge in bestial sentiments! A female buffalo has got horns; she, being\nexcited with passion, may select your Mahi _s_ a with horns as her husband and\ncome to him bellowing. I am not stupid nor like her so as to make him my\nhusband. O Villain! I will fight and destroy the enemies of the gods in the\nbattle-field. Or\n\n\n\np. 389\n\n\n\nif he desires to live, let him flee to Patala. O King! Hearing those rough\nwords uttered by Her in a moment of madness, I have come to you, thinking also\nhow to redress this wrong. O King! Only I feared not to interrupt in your love\nsentiment; and therefore I did not fight with Her; especially, without Your\ncommand, how can I engage myself in useless excitement? O Lord of the Earth!\nThat handsome woman rests maddened on Her own strength; I do not know what is\nin the womb of future or whatever is destined to happen, will surely come to\npass. You are the sole master in this matter; I will do whatever you order me.\nThe matter is very difficult to be reflected upon; whether it is better to\nfight or it is better to fly away, I cannot say definitely.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Tenth Chapter of the Fifth Skandha on the messenger's news to\nMahi _s_ a, in S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk05ch11.htm)\n\n"
