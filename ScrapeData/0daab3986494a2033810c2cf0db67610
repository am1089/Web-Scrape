Tat savitur v _ri_ _n_ imahe (Rv. V, 82, 1-3) and adya no deva savitar\n(Rv. V, 82, 4-6) are the beginning (pratipad) and the next step (anu _k_ ara)\nof the Vai _s_ vadeva hymn, taken from the Ekaha ceremonial and therefore\nproper 2.\n\n2\\. On that day 3 much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to\nbe atoned for. Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end\nof the year the sacrificers; rest on this atonement as their rest. He who\nknows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot _ri_ priest who knows\nthis, recites this hymn.\n\n3\\. Then (follows) the hymn addressed to Savit _ri_ , tad devasya savitur\nvaryam mahat (Rv. IV, 53). Verily, mahat, great, (in this foot) is the end 4.\nThis day too is the end. Thus the verse is fit for the day.\n\np. 198\n\n4\\. The hymn katara purva katara parayo _h_ (Rv. I, 185), addressed to Dyavap\n_ri_ thivi, is one in which many verses have the same ending. Verily, this day\nalso (the mahavrata) is one in which many receive the same reward 1. Thus it\nis fit for the day.\n\n5\\. The hymn ana _s_ vo _g_ ato anabhi _s_ ur ukthya _h_ (Rv. IV, 36) is\naddressed to the _Ri_ bhus.\n\n6\\. In the first verse the word tri ( _k_ akra _h_ ) occurs, and trivat 2 is\nverily the end. This day also is the end (of the sacrifice). Thus the verse is\nfit for the day.\n\n7\\. The hymn asya vamasya palitasya hotu _h_ (Rv. I, 164), addressed to the Vi\n_s_ vedevas, is multiform. This day also is multiform 3. Thus the verse is fit\nfor the day.\n\n8\\. He recites the end of it, beginning with gaurir mimaya (Rv. I, 164, 41).\n\n9\\. The hymn a no bhadra _h_ kratavo yantu vi _s_ vata _h_ (Rv. I, 89),\naddressed to the Vi _s_ vedevas, forms the Nividdhana, taken from the Ekaha\nceremonial, and therefore proper.\n\n10\\. On that day much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to\nbe atoned for. Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end\nof the year the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest. He who knows\nthis rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot _ri_ priest who knows this,\nrecites this hymn.\n\n11\\. The hymn vai _s_ vanaraya dhisha _n_ am _ri_ tav _ri_ dhe\n\np. 199\n\n[paragraph continues] (Rv. III, 2) forms the beginning of the \xc3\x82gnimaruta.\nDhisha _n_ a, thought, is verily the end, this day also is the end. Thus it is\nfit for the day.\n\n12\\. The hymn praya _g_ yavo maruto bhra _g_ ad _ri_ sh _t_ aya _h_ (Rv. V,\n55), addressed to the Maruts, is one in which many verses have the same\nending. Verily, this day also is one in which many receive the same reward.\nThus it is fit for the day 1.\n\n13\\. He recites the verse _g_ atavedase sunavama somam (Rv. I, 99, 1),\naddressed to _G_ atavedas, before the (next following) hymn. That verse\naddressed to _G_ atavedas is verily welfare, and leads to welfare. Thus (by\nreciting it) he fares well 2.\n\n14\\. The hymn ima _m_ stomam arhate _g_ atavedase (Rv. I, 94), addressed to\n_G_ atavedas, is one in which many verses have the same ending. Verily, this\nday also (the mahavrata) is one in which many receive the same reward. Thus it\nis fit for the day, yea, it is fit for the day.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[197:1](sbe01201.htm#fr_495) After finishing the Nishkevalya of the noon-\nlibation, he explains the vai _s_ vadeva _s_ astra of the third libation.\n\n[197:2](sbe01201.htm#fr_496) The norm of the Mahavrata is the Vi _s_ va _g_\nit, and the norm of that, the Agnish _t_ oma Ekaha.
