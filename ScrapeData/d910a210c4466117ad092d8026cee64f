I magnify [2](sbe46003.htm#an_1:1:1:2) Agni,\nthe Purohita, the divine ministrant of the sacrifice, the Hot _ri_ priest, the\ngreatest bestower of treasures.\n\n2\\. Agni, worthy to be magnified by the ancient _Ri_ shis and by the present\nones--may he conduct the gods hither.\n\n3\\. May one obtain through Agni wealth and welfare day by day, which may bring\nglory and high bliss of valiant offspring.\n\n4\\. Agni, whatever sacrifice and worship [1](sbe46003.htm#an_1:1:4:1) thou\nencompassest on every side, that indeed goes to the gods.\n\n5\\. May Agni the thoughtful Hot _ri_ , he who is true and most splendidly\nrenowned, may the god come hither with the gods.\n\n6\\. Whatever good thou wilt do to thy worshipper, O Agni, that (work) verily\nis thine, O A\xe1\xb9\x85giras\n\n7\\. Thee, O Agni, we approach day by day, O (god) who shinest in the darkness\n[1](sbe46003.htm#an_1:1:7:1); with our prayer, bringing adoration to thee--\n\n8\\. Who art the king of all worship, the guardian of _Ri_ ta, the shining one,\nincreasing in thy own house.\n\n9\\. Thus, O Agni, be easy of access to us, as a father is to his son. Stay\nwith us for our happiness.\n\np. 2\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe hymn is ascribed to Madhu _k_ _kh_ andas Vai _s_ vamitra, and may possibly\nbelong to an author of the Vi _s_ vamitra family. See my Prolegomena, p. 261.\nMetre, Gayatri. The hymn has been translated and commented upon by M. M.,\nPhysical Religion, pp. 170-173.\n\nVerse 1 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 3; MS. IV, 10, 5. Verse 3 = TS. III, 1, 11, 1; IV, 3,\n13, 5; MS. IV, 10, 4 (IV, 14, 16). Verse 4 = TS. IV, 1, 11, 1; MS. IV, 10, 3.\nVerse 7 = SV. I, 14. Verses 7-9 = VS. III, 22-24; TS. I, 5, 6, 2; MS. I, 5, 3.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. This verse being the first verse of the Rig-veda as we now possess it,\nseems already to have occupied the same position in the time of the author of\nthe hymns X, 20-26\\. For, after a short benediction, the opening words of this\ncollection of hymns are also agnim i _l_ e, 'I magnify Agni.' Comp. my\nProlegomena, p. 231.\n\nNote 2. The verb which I translate by 'magnify'--being well aware that it is\nimpossible to do full justice to its meaning by such a translation--is i _d_.\nThere seems to me no doubt that this verb is etymologically connected with the\nsubstantives ish, 'food,' i _d_ , i _d_ a, ira (not with the root ya _g_ of\nwhich Brugmann, Indogermanische Forschungen I, 171, thinks). We need not ask\nhere whether the connection between i _d_ and ish is effected by a\n'Wurzeldeterminativ' (root-determinative) d--in this case we should have here\ni _d_ for izhd, comp. ni _d_ a for nizhda, pi _d_ for pizhd, &c.; see\nBrugmann's Grundriss, vol. i, 591--or whether i _d_ is a reduplicated present\nof i _d_ (of the type described by Brugmann, Grundriss, vol. ii, p. 854; comp.\ni\xc2\xb4rte, &c.). The original meaning of i\xc2\xb4 _d_ e at all events seems to be 'I\ngive sap or nourishment.' Now in the Vedic poetry and ritual, the idea of sap\nor nourishment is especially connected with the different products coming from\nthe cow, milk and\n\np. 3\n\nbutter. The footsteps of the goddess I _d_ a drip with butter. The words\n'agnim i _d_ e' seem to me, consequently, originally to convey the idea of\ncelebrating Agni by pouring sacrificial butter into the fire. There is a\nnumber of passages in the Rig-veda which, in my opinion, show clear traces of\nthis original meaning of the verb. Thus we read X, 53, 2. ya _g_ amahai ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ iyan hanta deva\xc2\xb4n i\xc2\xb4 _l_ amahai i\xc2\xb4 _d_ yan a\xc2\xb4 _g_ yena, 'let us sacrifice\n(ya _g_ ) to the gods to whom sacrifice is due; let us magnify (i _d_ ) with\nbutter those to whom magnifying is due.' V, 14, 3. tam hi _s_ a _s_ vanta _h_\ni\xc2\xb4 _l_ ate sru _k_ a\xc2\xb4 devam gh _ri_ ta _s_ _k_ uta agnim havya\xc2\xb4ya vo _lh_ ave,\n'for all people magnify this god Agni with the butter-dripping sacrificial\nspoon that he may carry the sacrificial food.' V, 28, I. deva\xc2\xb4n i\xc2\xb4 _l_ ana\nhavisha gh _ri_ ta\xc2\xb4 _k_ i, 'magnifying the gods with sacrificial food, (the\nspoon) filled with butter.' Comp. also I, 84, 18; VI, 70, 4; VIII, 74, 6; X,\n118, 3. Then, by a gradual development, we find the verb i _d_ or the noun i\n_l_ enya connected with such instrumentals as gira\xc2\xb4 or girbhi _h_ , 'to\nmagnify by songs,' or stomai _h_ 'by praises,' namasa by 'adoration,' and the\nlike. The Rig-vedic texts, however, show us very clearly that even in such\nphrases the original meaning of i _d_ was not quite forgotten. For the word is\nnot used indifferently of any praise offered to any god whatever. No god of\nthe Vedic Pantheon is praised so frequently and so highly by the poets of the\nRig-veda as Indra. Yet, with very few exceptions, the word i _d_ is avoided in\nconnection with this god. The whole ninth Ma _n_ _d_ ala contains nothing but\npraises of Soma Pavamana. Yet the word I _d_ occurs, in the whole of this Ma\n_n_ _d_ ala, in two passages only (5, 3; 66, 1) of which one is contained in\nan \xc3\x82pri verse transferring artificially to Soma such qualifications as belong\noriginally to Agni. On the other hand, in the invocations addressed to Agni,\nthis verb and its derivatives are most frequently used. We may conclude that\nthe idea of celebration, as conveyed by these words, had a connotation which\nqualified them for the employment with regard to Agni, the god nourished by\nofferings of butter, much better than for being addressed to Indra, the\ndrinker of the Soma juice, or to the god Soma himself.\n\np. 4\n\nLast comes, I believe, the meaning of i _d_ as contained in a very small\nnumber of passages such as VII, 91, 2. indravayu sustuti _h_ vam iyana\xc2\xb4 mar\n_d_ ikam i _t_ _t_ e suvitam _k_ a navyam, 'Indra and Vayu! Our beautiful\npraise, approaching you, asks you for mercy and for new welfare.' Here the\nconstruction of i _d_ is such as if in English the phrase, 'men magnify the\ngods for obtaining mercy,' could be expressed in the words 'men magnify the\ngods mercy.'\n\nI conclude by quoting the more important recent literature referring to i _d_\n: Prof. Max Muller's note on V, 60, 1 (S. B. E. vol. xxxii, p. 354); Physical\nReligion, p. 170; Bezzenberger, Nachrichten von der Gottinger Gesellsch. d.\nWissensch. 1878, p. 264; Bechtel, Bezzenberger's Beitrage, X, 286;\nBartholomae, ibid. XII, 91; Arische Forschungen, II, 78; Indogermanische\nForschungen, III, 28, note 1; Brugmann, Indogermanische Forschungen, I, 171;\nK. F. Johansson, Indogermanische Forschungen, II, 47. Comp. also Bartholomae,\nArische Forschungen, I, 21; III, 52, and Joh. Schmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift,\nXXXII, 389.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. 'Worship' is a very inadequate translation of adhvara, which is nearly\na synonym of ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, by the side of which it frequently stands. Possibly\nin the designation of the sacrifice as ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a the stress was laid on the\nelement of prayer, praises, and adoration; in the designation as adhvara on\nthe actual work which was chiefly done by the Adhvaryu.--Prof. Max Muller\nwrites: 'I accept the native explanation a-dhvara, without a flaw, perfect,\nwhole, holy. Adhvara is generally an opus operatum; hence adhvaryu, the\noperating priest.' Comp. Physical Religion, p. 171. Bury's derivation of\nadhvara from madhu (m\xcc\xa5dhu-ara, Bezzenberger's Beitrage, VII, 339) is much more\ningenious than convincing.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. I have translated doshavastar as a vocative which, as is rendered very\nprobable by the accent, was also the opinion of the diaskeuasts of the Sa _m_\nhita text.\n\np. 5\n\n[paragraph continues] The author of the sacrificial formula which is given in\n\xc3\x82 _s_ val. _S_ raut. III, 12, 4 and Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kh. G _ri_ hy. V, 5, 4, evidently\nunderstood the word in the same way; there Agni is invoked as doshavastar and\nas pratarvastar, as shining in the darkness of evening and as shining in the\nmorning. That this may indeed be the true meaning of the word is shown by Rig-\nveda III, 49, 4, where Indra is called kshapa\xc2\xb4m vasta\xc2\xb4 'the illuminator of the\nnights' (kshapa\xc2\xb4m is gen. plur., not as Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beitrage,\nXV, 208, takes it, loc. sing.). The very frequent passages, however, in which\ncase-forms of dosha\xc2\xb4 stand in opposition to words meaning 'dawn' or 'morning'\n--which words in most cases are derived from the root vas--strongly favour the\nopinion of Gaedicke (Der Accusativ im Veda, 177, note 3) and K. F. Johansson\n(Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XIV, 163), who give to doshavastar the meaning 'in\nthe darkness and in the morning.' This translation very well suits all Rig-\nveda passages in which the word occurs. If this opinion is accepted,\ndoshavastar very probably ought to be written and accented as two independent\nwords, dosha\xc2\xb4 vastar. See M. M., Physical Religion, p. 173.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 12](sbe46004.htm)\n\n"
