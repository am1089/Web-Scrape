Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# RAMAYANA BOOK V\n\n# PANCHAVATI\n\n_\n\n(On the Banks of the Godavari)\n\n_\n\nTHE wanderings of Rama in the Deccan, his meeting with Saint Agastya, and his\nresidence on the banks of the Godavari river, are narrated in this Book. The\nreader has now left Northern India and crossed the Vindhya mountains; and the\nscene of the present and succeeding five Books is laid in the Deccan and\nSouthern India. The name of Agastya is connected with the Deccan, and many are\nthe legends told of this great Saint, before whom the Vindhya mountains bent\nin awe, and by whose might the Southern ocean was drained. It is likely that\nsome religious teacher of that name first penetrated beyond the Vindhyas, and\nfounded the first Aryan settlement in the Deccan, three thousand years ago. He\nwas pioneer, discoverer and settler,-the Indian Columbus who opened out\nSouthern India to Aryan colonization and Aryan religion.\n\nTwo yojanas from Agastya\'s hermitage, Rama built his forest dwelling in the\nwoods of Panchavati, near the sources of the Godavari river, and within a\nhundred miles from the modern city of Bombay. There he lived with his wife and\nbrother in peace and piety, and the Book closes with the description of an\nIndian winter morning, when the brothers and Sita went for their ablutions to\nthe Godavari, and thought of their distant home in Oudh. The description of\nthe peaceful forest-life of the exiles comes in most appropriately on the eve\nof stirring events which immediately succeed, and which give a new turn to the\nstory of the Epic. We now stand therefore at the turning point of the poet\'s\nnarrative; he has sung of domestic incidents and of peaceful hermitages so\nfar; he sings of dissensions and wars hereafter.\n\nThe portions translated in this Book form Sections i., xii., xiii., xv., and\nxvi. of Book iii. of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## THE HERMITAGE OF AGASTYA\n\nRighteous Rama, soft-eyed Sita, and the gallant Lakshman stood  \nIn the wilderness of Dandaki--trackless, pathless, boundless wood,\n\nBut within its gloomy gorges, dark and deep and known to few,  \nHumble homes of hermit sages rose before the princes\' view.\n\nCoats of bark and scattered _kusa_ spake their peaceful pure abode,  \nSeat of pious rite and penance which with holy splendour glowed,\n\nForest songsters knew the _asrama_ and the wild deer crept its blade,  \nAnd the sweet-voiced sylvan wood-nymph haunted oft its holy shade,\n\nBrightly blazed the sacred altar, vase and ladle stood around,  \nFruit and blossom, skin and faggot, sanctified the holy ground.\n\nFrom the broad and bending branches ripening-, fruits in clusters hung,  \nAnd with gifts and rich libations hermits raised the ancient song,\n\nLotus and the virgin lily danced upon the rippling rill,  \nAnd the golden sunlight glittered on the greenwoods calm and still,\n\nAnd the consecrated woodland by the holy hermits trod,  \nShone like BRAHMA\'S sky in lustre, hallowed by the grace of God!\n\nRama loosened there his bow-string and the peaceful scene surveyed,  \nAnd the holy sages welcomed wanderers in the forest shade,\n\nRama bright as Lord of Midnight, Sita with her saintly face,  \nLakshman young and true and valiant, decked with warrior\'s peerless grace!\n\nLeafy hut the holy sages to the royal guests assigned,  \nBrought them fruit and forest blossoms, blessed them with their blessings\nkind,\n\n"Raghu\'s son," thus spake the sages, "helper of each holy rite,  \nPortion of the royal INDRA, fount of justice and of might,\n\nOn thy throne or in the forest, king of nations, lord of men,  \nGrant us to thy kind protection in this hermit\'s lonely den!\n\nHomely fare and jungle produce were before the princes laid,  \nAnd the toil-worn, tender Sita slumbered in the _asram\'s_ shade.\n\nThus from grove to grove they wandered, to each haunt of holy sage,  \nSarabhanga\'s sacred dwelling and Sutikshna\'s hermitage,\n\nTill they met the Saint Agastya, mightiest Saint of olden time,  \nHarbinger of holy culture in the wilds of Southern clime!\n\n"Eldest born of Dasa-ratha, long and far hath Rama strayed,"  \nThus to pupil of Agastya young and gallant Lakshman said,--\n\n"With his faithful consort Sita in these wilds he wanders still,  \nI am righteous Rama\'s younger, duteous to his royal will,\n\nAnd we pass these years of exile to our father\'s mandate true,  \nFain to mighty Saint Agastya we would render homage due!"\n\nListening to his words the hermit sought the shrine of Sacred Fire,  \nSpake the message of the princes to the Saint and ancient Sire:\n\n"Righteous Rama, valiant Lakshman, saintly Sita seek this shade,  \nAnd to see thee, radiant rishi, have in humble accents prayed."\n\n"Hath he come," so spake Agastya, "Rama prince of Raghu\'s race,  \nYouth for whom this heart hath thirsted, youth endued with righteous grace,\n\nHath he come with wife and brother to accept our greetings kind,  \nWherefore came ye for permission, wherefore linger they behind?\n\nRama and the soft-eyed Sita, were with gallant Lakshman led,  \nWhere the dun deer free and fearless roamed within the holy shade,\n\nWhere the shrines of great Immortals stood in order thick and close,  \nAnd by bright and blazing altars chanted songs and hymns arose.\n\nBRAHMA and the flaming AGNI, VISHNU lord of heavenly light,  \nINDRA and benign VIVASAT ruler of the azure height,\n\nSOMA and the radiant BHAGA, and KUVERA lord of gold,  \nAnd VIDHATRI great Creator worshipped by the saints of old,\n\nVAYU breath of living creatures, YAMA monarch of the dead,  \nAnd VARUNA with his fetters which the trembling sinners dread,\n\nHoly Spirit of GAYATRI goddess of the morning prayer,  \nVASUS and the hooded NAGAS, golden-winged GARUDA fair,\n\nKARTIKEYA heavenly leader strong to conquer and to bless,  \nDHARMA god of human duty and of human righteousness,\n\nShrines of all these bright Immortals ruling in the skies above,  \nFilled the pure and peaceful forest with a calm and holy love!\n\nGirt by hermits righteous-hearted then the Saint Agastya came,  \nRich in wealth of pious penance, rich in learning and in fame,\n\nMighty-armed Rama marked him radiant like the midday sun,  \nBowed and rendered due obeisance with each act of homage done,\n\nValiant Lakshman tall and stately to the great Agastya bent,  \nWith a woman\'s soft devotion Sita, bowed unto the saint.\n\nSaint Agastya raised the princes, greeted them in accents sweet,  \nGave them fruit and herb and water, offered them the honoured seat,\n\nWith libations unto AGNI offered welcome to each guest,  \nFood and drink beseeming hermits on the wearied princes pressed.\n\n"False the hermits," spake Agastya, "who to guests their dues deny,  \nHunger they in life hereafter-like the speaker of a lie.\n\nAnd a royal guest and wanderer doth our foremost honour claim,  \nCar-borne kings protect the wide earth by their prowess and their fame,\n\nBy these fruits and forest blossoms be our humble homage shewn,  \nBy some gift, of Rama worthy, be Agastya\'s blessings known!\n\nTake this bow, heroic Rama,--need for warlike arms is thine,--  \nGems of more than earthly radiance on the goodly weapon shine,\n\nWorshipper of righteous VISHNU! VISHNU\'S wondrous weapon take,  \nHeavenly artist VISWA-KARMAN shaped this bow of heavenly make!\n\nTake this shining dart of BRAHMA radiant like a tongue of flame,  \nSped by good and worthy archer never shall it miss its aim,\n\nAnd this INDRA\'s ample quiver filled with arrows true and keen,  \nFilled with arrows still unfailing in the battle\'s dreadful scene!\n\nTake this sabre golden-hilted in its case of burnished gold,  \nNot unworthy of a monarch and a warrior true and bold,\n\nImpious foes of bright Immortals know these weapons dread and dire,  \nMowing down the ranks of foemen, scathing like the forest fire!\n\n_\n\nBe these weapons thy companions,-Rama, thou shalt need them oft,  \nMeet and conquers till thy foemen like the Thunder-God aloft!"\n\n_\n\n## II\n\n## THE COUNSEL OF AGASTYA\n\n"Pleased am I," so spake Agastya, "in these forests dark and wild,  \nThou hast come to seek me, Rama, with the saintly Janak\'s child,\n\nBut like pale and drooping blossom severed from the parent tree,  \nFar from home in toil and trouble, faithful Sita follows thee,\n\nTrue to wedded lord and husband she hath followed Raghu\'s son,  \nWith a woman\'s deep devotion woman\'s duty she hath done!\n\nHow unlike the fickle woman, true while Fame and Fortune smile,  \nFaithless when misfortunes gather, loveless in her wicked wile,\n\nHow unlike the changeful woman, false as light the lightnings fling,  \nKeen as sabre, quick as tempest, swift as bird upon its wing!\n\nDead to Fortune\'s frown or favour, Sita still in truth abides,  \nAs the star of Arundhati in her mansion still resides,\n\nRest thee with thy gentle consort, farther still she may not roam,  \nHolier were this hermit\'s forest as the saintly Sita\'s home!"\n\n"Great Agastya!" answered Rama, "blessed is my banished life,  \nFor thy kindriess to an exile and his friendless homeless wife,\n\nBut in wilder, gloomier forests lonesome we must wander still,  \nWhere a deeper, darker shadow settles on the rock and rill."\n\n"Be it so," Agastya answered, "two short _yojans_ from this place,  \nWild is Panchavati\'s forest where unseen the wild deer race,\n\nGodavari\'s limpid waters through its gloomy gorges flow,  \nFruit and root and luscious berries on its silent margin grow,\n\nSeek that spot and with thy brother build a lonesome leafy home,  \nTend thy true and toil-worn Sita, farther still she may not roam!\n\nNot unknown to me the mandate by thy royal father given,  \nNot unseen thy endless wanderings destined by the will of Heaven,\n\nTherefore Panchavati\'s forest marked I for thy woodland stay,  \nWhere the ripening wild fruit clusters and the wild bird trills his lay,\n\nTend thy dear devoted Sita and protect each pious rite,  \nMatchless in thy warlike wcapons peerless in thy princely might!\n\nMark yon gloomy Mahua forest stretching o\'er the boundless lea,  \nPass that wood and turning northward seek an old _Nyagrodha_ tree,\n\nThen ascend a sloping upland by a steep and lofty hill,  \nThou shalt enter Panchavati, blossom-covered, calm and still!"\n\nBowing to the great Agastya, Rama left the mighty sage,  \nBowing to each saint and hermit, Lakshman left the hermitage,\n\nAnd the princes tall and stately marched where Panchavati lay,  \nSoft-eyed Sita followed meekly where her Rama led the way!\n\n## III\n\n## THE FOREST OF PANCHAVATI\n\nGodavari\'s limpid waters in her gloomy gorges strayed,  \nUnseen rangers of the jungle nestled in the darksome shade!\n\n"Mark the woodlands," uttered Rama, "by the Saint Agastya told,  \nPanchavati\'s lonesome forest with its blossoms red and gold,\n\nSkilled to scan the wood and jungle, Lakshman, cast thy eye around,  \nFor our humble home and dwelling seek a low and level ground,\n\nWhere the river laves its margin with a soft and gentle kiss,  \nWhere my sweet and soft-eyed Sita may repose in sylvan bliss,\n\nWhere the lawn is fresh and verdant and the kwa young and bright,  \nAnd the creeper yields her blossoms for our sacrificial rite."\n\n"Little can I help thee, brother," did the duteous Lakshman say,  \n"Thou art prompt to judge and fathom, Lakshman listens to obey!\n\n"Mark this spot," so answered Rama, leading Lakshman by the hand,  \n"Soft the lawn of verdant _kusa_ , beauteous blossoms light the land,\n\nMark the smiling lake of lotus gleaming with a radiance fair,  \nWafting fresh and gentle fragrance o\'er the rich and laden air,\n\nMark each scented shrub and creeper bending o\'er the lucid wave,  \nWhere the bank with soft caresses Godavari\'s waters lave!\n\nTuneful ducks frequent this margin, Chakravakas breathe of love,  \nAnd the timid deer of jungle browse within the shady grove,\n\nAnd the valleys are resonant with the peacock\'s clarion cry,  \nAnd the trees with budding blossoms glitter on the mountains high,\n\nAnd the rocks in well-marked strata in their glittering lines appear,  \nLike the streaks of white and crimson painted on our tuskers fair!\n\nStately _Sal_ and feathered palm-tree guard this darksome forest-land,  \nGolden date and flowering mango stretch afar on either hand,\n\n_\n\nAsok_ thrives and blazing _Kinsuk_ , _Chandan_ wafts a fragrance rare,  \n_Aswa-karna_ and _Khadira_ by the _Sami_ dark and fair,\n\nBeauteous spot for hermit-dwelling joyous with the voice of song,  \nHaunted by the timid wild deer and by black buck fleet and strong!\n\nFoe-compelling faithful Lakshman heard the words his elder said,  \nAnd by sturdy toil and labour stately home and dwelling made,\n\nSpacious was the leafy cottage walled with moistened earth and soft,  \nPillared with the stately bamboo holding high the roof aloft,\n\nInterlacing twigs and branches, corded from the ridge to eaves,  \nHeld the thatch of reed and branches and of jungle grass and leaves,\n\nAnd the floor was pressed and levelled and the toilsome task was done  \nAnd the structure rose in beauty for the righteous Raghu\'s son!\n\nTo the river for ablutions Lakshman went of warlike fame,  \nWith a store of fragrant lotus and of luscious berries came,\n\nSacrificing to the Bright Gods sacred hymns and _mantras_ said,  \nProudly then unto his elder shewed the home his hand had made.\n\nIn her soft and grateful accents gentle Sita praised his skill,  \nPraised a brother\'s loving labour, praised a hero\'s dauntless will,\n\nRama clasped his faithful Lakshman in a brother\'s fond embrace,  \nSpake in sweet and kindly accents with an elder\'s loving grace:\n\nHow can Rama, homeless wand\'rer, priceless love like thine requite,  \nLet him hold thee in his bosom, soul of love and arm of might,\n\nAnd our father good and gracious, in a righteous son like thee,  \nLives again and treads the bright earth, from the bonds of YAMA free!"\n\nThus spake Rama, and with Lakshman and with Sita child of love,  \nDwelt in Panchavati\'s cottage as the Bright Gods dwell above!\n\n## IV\n\n## WINTER IN PANCHAVATI\n\nCame and passed the golden autumn in the forest\'s gloomy shade,  \nAnd the northern blasts of winter swept along the silent glade,\n\nWhen the chilly night was over, once at morn the prince of fame,  \nFor his morning\'s pure ablutions to the Godavari came.\n\nMeek-eyed Sita softly followed with the pitcher in her arms,  \nGallant Lakshman spake to Rama of the Indian winter\'s charms:\n\n"Comes the bright and bracing winter to the royal Rama dear,  \nLike a bride the beauteous season doth in richest robes appear,\n\nFrosty air and freshening zephyrs wake to life each mart and plain,  \nAnd the corn in dewdrop sparkling makes a sea of waving green,\n\nBut the village maid and matron shun the freezing river\'s shore,  \nBy the fire the village elder tells the stirring tale of yore!\n\nWith the winter\'s ample harvest men perform each pious rite,  \nTo the Fathers long departed, to the Gods of holy might,\n\nWith the rite of _agrayana_ pious men their sins dispel,  \nAnd with gay and sweet observance songs of love the women tell,\n\nAnd the monarchs bent on conquest mark the winter\'s cloudless glow,  \nLead their bannered cars and forces \'gainst the rival and the foe!\n\nSouthwards rolls the solar chariot, and the cold and widowed North  \nReft of \'bridal mark\' and joyance coldly sighs her sorrows forth,\n\nSouthward rolls the solar chariot, Himalaya, \'home of snow,\'  \nTrue to name and appellation doth in whiter garments glow,\n\nSouthward rolls the solar chariot, cold and crisp the frosty air,  \nAnd the wood of flower dismantled doth in russet robes appear!\n\nStar of Pushya rules December and the night with rime is hoar,  \nAnd beneath the starry welkin in the woods we sleep no more,\n\nAnd the pale moon mist-enshrouded sheds a faint and feeble beam,  \nAs the breath obscures the mirror, winter mist obscures her gleam,\n\nHidden by the rising vapour faint she glistens on the dale,  \nLike our sun-embrowned Sita with her toil and penance pale!\n\nSweeping blasts from western mountains through the gorges whistle by  \nAnd the _saras_ and the curlew raise their shrill and piercing cry,\n\nBoundless fields of wheat and barley are with dewdrops moist and wet,  \nAnd the golden rice of winter ripens like the clustering date,\n\nPeopled marts and rural hamlets wake to life and cheerful toil,  \nAnd the peaceful happy nations prosper on their fertile soil!\n\nMark the sun in morning vapours-like the moon subdued and pale  \nBrightening as the day advances piercing through the darksome veil,\n\nMark his gay and golden lustre sparkling o\'er the dewy lea,  \nMantling hill and field and forest, painting bush and leaf and tree,\n\nMark it glisten on the green grass, on each bright and bending blade,  \nLighten up the long-drawn vista, shooting through the gloomy glade!\n\nThirst-impelled the lordly tusker still avoids the freezing drink,  \nWild duck and the tuneful _hansa_ doubtful watch the river\'s brink,\n\nFrom the rivers wrapped in vapour unseen cries the wild curlew,  \nUnseen rolls the misty streamlet o\'er its sandbank soaked in dew,\n\nAnd the drooping water-lily bends her head beneath the frost,  \nLost her fresh and fragrant beauty and her tender petals lost!\n\nNow my errant fancy wanders to Ayodhya\'s distant town,  \nWhere in hermit\'s barks and tresses Bharat wears the royal crown,\n\nScorning regal state and splendoar, spurning pleasures loved of yore,  \nSpends his winter day in penance, sleeps at night upon the floor,\n\nAye! perchance Sarayu\'s waters seeks he now, serene and brave,  \nAs we seek, when dawns the daylight, Godavari\'s limpid wave!\n\nRich of hue, with eye of lotus, truthful, faithful, strong of mind,  \nFor the love he bears thee, Rama, spurns each joy of baser kind,\n\n\'False he proves unto his father who is led by mother\'s wile,\'  \nVain this ancient impious adage-Bharat spurns his mother\'s guile,\n\nBharat\'s mother Queen Kaikeyi, Dasa-ratha\'s royal spouse,  \nDeep in craft, hath brought disaster on Ayodhya\'s royal house!"\n\n"Speak not thus," so Rama answered, "on Kaikeyi cast no blame,  \nHonour still the righteous Bharat, honour still the royal dame,\n\nFixed in purpose and unchanging still in jungle wilds I roam,  \nBut thy accents, gentle Lakshman, wake a longing for my home!\n\nAnd my loving mem\'ry lingers on each word from Bharat fell  \nSweeter than the draught of nectar, purer than the crystal well,\n\nAnd my righteous purpose falters, shaken by a brother\'s love,  \nMay we meet again our brother, if it please the Gods above!"\n\nWaked by love, a silent tear-drop fell on Godavari\'s wave,  \nTrue once more to righteous purpose Rama\'s heart was calm and brave\n\nRama plunged into the river\'neath the morning\'s crimson beam,  \nSits, softly sought the waters as the lily seeks the stream,\n\nAnd they prayed to Gods and Fathers with each rite and duty doue,  \nAnd they sang the ancient _mantra_ to the red and rising Sun,\n\nWith her lord, in loosened tresses Sita to her cottage came,  \nAs with RUDRA wanders UMA in Kailasa\'s hill of fame!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book VI: Sita Lost](rama06.htm)\n\n'
