 \nNo least offence I find in him,  \nI see no fault his fame to dim.  \nNot one in all the world I know,  \nNot outcast wretch, not secret foe,  \nWhose whispering lips would dare assail  \nHis spotless life with slanderous tale.  \nGodlike and bounteous, just, sincere,  \nE\'en to his very foemen dear:  \nWho would without a cause neglect  \nThe right, and such a son reject?  \nAnd if a king such order gave,  \nIn second childhood, passion\'s slave,  \nWhat son within his heart would lay  \nThe senseless order, and obey?  \nCome, Rama, ere this plot be known  \nStand by me and secure the throne.  \nStand like the King who rules below,  \nStand aided by thy brother\'s bow:  \nHow can the might of meaner men  \nResist thy royal purpose then!  \nMy shafts, if rebels court their fate,  \nShall lay Ayodhya desolate.  \nThen shall her streets with blood be dyed  \nOf those who stand on Bharat\'s side:  \nNone shall my slaughtering hand exempt,  \nFor gentle patience earns contempt.  \nIf, by Kaikeyis counsel changed,  \nOur father\'s heart be thus estranged,  \nNo mercy must our arm restrain,  \nBut let the foe be slain, be slain.  \nFor should the guide, respected long,  \nNo more discerning right and wrorg,  \nTurn in forbidden paths to stray,  \n\'Tis meet that force his steps should stay.  \nWhat power sufficient can he see,  \nWhat motive for the wish has he,  \nThat to Kaikeyi would resign  \nThe empire which is justly thine?  \nCan he, O conqueror of thy foes,  \nThy strength and mine in war oppose?  \nCan he entrust, in our despite,  \nTo Bharat\'s hand thy royal right!  \nI love this brother with the whole  \nAffection of my faithful soul.  \nYea Queen, by bow and truth I swear,  \nBy sacrifice, and gift, and prayer,  \nIf Rama to the forest goes,  \nOr where the burning furnace glows,  \nFirst shall my feet the forest tread,  \nThe flames shall first surround my head.  \nMy might shall chase thy grief and tears,  \nAs darkness flies when morn appears.  \nDo thou, dear Queen, and Rama too  \nBehold what power like mine can do.  \nMy aged father I will kill,  \nThe vassal of Kaikeyi\'s will,  \nOld, yet a child, the woman\'s thrall,  \nInfirm, and base, the scorn of all.\'  \n   Thus Lakshman cried,the mighty-souled:  \nDown her sad cheeks the torrents rolled,  \nAs to her son Kaus\'aly?spake:  \n   \'Now thou hast heard thy brother, take  \nHis counsel if thou hold it wise,  \nAnd do the thing his words advise.  \nDo not, my son, with tears I pray,  \nMy rival\'s wicked word obey,  \nLeave me not here consumed with woe,  \nNor to the wood, an exile, go.  \nIf thou, to virtue ever true,  \nThy duty\'s path would still pursue,  \nThe highest duty bids thee stay  \nAnd thus thy mother\'s voice obey.  \nThus Kas\'yap\'s great ascetic son  \nA seat among the Immortals won:  \nIn his own home, subdued, he stayed,  \nAnd honour to his mother paid.  \nIf reverence to thy sire be due,  \nThy mother claims like honour too,  \nAnd thus I charge thee, O my child,  \nThou must not seek the forest wild.  \nAh, what to me were life and bliss,  \nCondemned my darling son to miss?  \nBut with my Rama near, to eat  \nThe very grass itself were sweet.  \nBut if thou still wilt go and leave.  \nThy hapless mother here to grieve,  \nI from that hour will food abjure,  \nNor life without my son endure.  \nThen it will be thy fate to dwell  \nIn depth of world-detested hell.  \nAs Ocean in the olden time  \nWas guilty of an impious crime  \nThat marked the lord of each fair flood  \nAs one who spills a Br?maa\'a blood.\' 1  \n   Thus spake the queen, and wept, and sighed:  \nThen righteous Rama thus replied:  \n\'I have no power to slight or break  \nCommandments which my father spake.  \nI bend my head, dear lady, low,  \nForgive me, for I needs must go.  \nOnce Kaudu, mighty saint, who made  \nHis dwelling in the forest shade,  \n\np. 119  \n\nA cow--and duty\'s claims he knew--  \nObedient to his father, slew.  \nAnd in the line from which we spring,  \nWhen ordered by their sire the king,  \nThrough earth the sons of Sagar cleft,  \nAnd countless things of life bereft.  1  \nSo Jamadagni\'s son  2 obeyed  \nHis sire, when in the wood he laid  \nHia hand upon his axe, and smote  \nThrough Renuka his mother\'s throat.  \nThe deeds of these and more beside.  \nPeers of the Gods, my steps shall guide,  \nAnd resolute will I fulfil  \nMy father\'s word, my father\'s will,  \nNor I, O Queen, unsanctioned tread  \nThis righteous path, by duty led:  \nThe road my footsteps journey o\'er  \nWas traversed by the great of yore.  \nThis high command which all accept  \nShall faithfully by me be kept,  \nFor duty ne\'er will him forsake  \nWho fears his sire\'s command to break.\'  \n\nThus to his mother wild with grief:  \nThen thus to Lakshman spake the chief  \nOf those by whom the bow is bent,  \nMid all who speak, most eloquent:  \n\'I know what love for me thou hast,  \nWhat firm devotion unsurpassed:  \nThy valour and thy worth I know,  \nAnd glory that appals the foe.  \nBlest youth, my mother\'s woe is great.  \nIt bends her \'neath its matchless weight:  \nNo claims will she, with blinded eyes,  \nOf truth and patience recognize,  \nFor duty is supreme in place,  \nAnd truth is duty\'s noblest base.  \nObedient to my sire\'s behest  \nI serve the cause of duty best.  \nFor man should truly do whate\'er  \nTo mother, Brahman, sire, he sware:  \nHe must in duty\'s path remain,  \nNor let his word be pledged in vain.  \nAnd, O my brother, how can I  \nObedience to this charge deny?  \nKaikeyi\'s tongue my purpose spurred,  \nBut \'twas my sire who gave the word.  \nCast these unholy thoughts aside  \nWhich smack of war and Warriors\' pride;  \nTo duty\'s call, not wrath attend,  \nAnd tread the path which I commend,\'  \n\nRama by fond affection moved  \nHis brother Lakshman thus reproved;  \nThen with joined hands and reverent head  \nAgain to Queen Kausalya said:  \n\n\'I needs must go--do thou consent--  \nTo the wild wood in banishment.  \nO give me, by my life I pray,  \nThy blessing ere I go away.  \n\nI, when the promised years are o\'er,  \nShall see Ayodhya\'s town once more.  \nThen, mother dear, thy tears restrain,  \nNor let thy heart be wrung by pain:  \nIn time, my father\'s will obeyed,  \nShall I return from greenwood shade.  \nMy dear Videhan, thou, and I,  \nLakshman, Sumitra, feel this tie,  \nAnd must my father\'s word obey,  \nAs duty bids that rules for aye.  \nThy preparations now forgo,  \nAnd lock within thy breast thy woe,  \nNor be my pious wish withstood  \nTo go an exile to the wood."  \nCalm and unmoved the prince explained  \n   His duty\'s claim and purpose high.  \nThe mother life and sense regained,  \n   Looked on her son and made reply:  \n\'If reverence be thy father\'s due,  \n   The same by right and love is mine:  \nGo not, my charge I thus renew,  \n   Nor leave me here in woe to pine,  \nWhat were such lonely life to me,  \n   Rites to the shades, or deathless lot?  \nMore dear, my son, one hour with thee  \n   Than all the world where thou art not.  \nAs bursts to view, when brands blaze high,  \n   Some elephant concealed by night,  \nSo, when he heard his mother\'s cry,  \n   Burnt Rama\'s grief with fiercer might.  \nThus to the queen, half senseless still,  \n   And Lakshman, burnt with heart-felt pain,  \nTrue to the right, with steadfast will,  \n   His duteous speech he spoke again:  \n\'Brother, I know thy loving mind,  \n   Thy valour and thy truth I know,  \nBut now to claims of duty blind  \n   Thou and my mother swell my woe.  \nThe fruits of deeds in human life  \n   Make love, gain, duty, manifest,  \nDear when they meet as some fond wife  \n   With her sweet babes upon her breast.  \nBut man to duty first should turn  \n   Whene\'er the three are not combined:  \nFor those who heed but gain we spurn,  \n   And those to pleasure all resigned.  \nShall then the virtuous disobey  \n   Hosts of an aged king and sire,  \nThough feverous joy that father sway,  \n   Or senseless love or causeless ire?  \nI have no powcr, commanded thus,  \n   To slight his promise and decree:  \nThe honoured sire of both of us,  \n   My mother\'s lord and life is he.  \nShall she, while yet the holy king  \n   Is living, on the right intent,--  \nShall she, like some poor widowed thing,  \n   Go forth with me to banishment?  \nNow, mother, speed thy parting son,  \n   And let thy blessing soothe my pain,  \n\np. 120  \n\nThat I may turn, mine exile done,  \n   Like King Yayati, home again.  \nFair glory and the fruit she gives,  \n   For lust of sway I ne\'er will slight:  \nWhat, for the span a mortal lives.  \n   Were rule of earth without the right?\'  \nHe soothed her thus, firm to the last  \n   His counsel to his brother told:  \nThen round the queen in reverence passed,  \n   And held her in his loving hold.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[118:1](ry099.htm#fr_288) The commentators say that, in a former creation,\nOcean grieved his mother and suffered in consequence the pains of hell.\n\n[119:1](ry099.htm#fr_289) As described in Book I, Canto XL.\n\n[119:2](ry099.htm#fr_290) Parasurama.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXII.: Lakshman Calmed.](ry100.htm)\n\n'
