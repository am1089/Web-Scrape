The wishes of a Brahma _n_ a who has left off evil deeds and is (ever)\nengaged in holy works are fulfilled even without (the practice of) restraints.\n1\n\n2\\. Upright Brahma _n_ as quickly accomplish whatever\n\np. 330\n\nthey wish in their hearts, if they are purified by honest actions.\n\n3\\. Thus a wise man should practise those restraints until he has purified his\nbodily frame.\n\n4\\. He who has been purified by those restraints should, after fasting three\n(days and) nights, begin the performance of that sacred rite through which he\nwishes to gain the fulfilment of his desires,\n\n5\\. (Reciting) the Kshapavitra, the Sahasraksha, the M _ri_ gara, the two _G_\na _n_ as (called) A _m_ homu _k_ , the Pavamanis, the Kushma _n_ _d_ is, and\nthe _Ri_ _k_ as, addressed to Vai _s_ vanara, 5\n\n6\\. (And) offering with (each of) these (Mantras) boiled rice and clarified\nbutter during seven days, in the morning, at midday, and in the evening,\nkeeping a rigid silence, living on food fit for a sacrifice, restraining his\nsenses and his actions,\n\n7\\. He is freed from all crimes, even mortal sins, after looking on a cross-\nroad at a pot filled with water, (and reciting the text), 'Si _m_ he me manyu\n_h_.'\n\n8\\. He is freed from the multitude of sins, committed unintentionally in old\nage, in youth, and in infancy, and even from those belonging to former births;\n\n9\\. After feeding at the end (of the seven days) Brahma _n_ as with milk and\nrice, well. mixed with\n\np. 331\n\nbutter, and distributing to them after their dinner cows, land, sesamum, and\ngold,\n\n10\\. A Brahma _n_ a becomes internally pure, his guilt being consumed like\nfuel, and fit for the performance of rites which secure the fulfilment of\nwishes and of rites like the kindling of the sacred fire.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[329:1](sbe1489.htm#fr_1460) **7**.
