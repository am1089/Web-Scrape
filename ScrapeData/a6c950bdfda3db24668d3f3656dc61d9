Though there still\nprevails some uncertainty as to the date of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara _k_ arya, commonly\nassigned to the eighth century A.D., yet I doubt whether any MSS. of the\nUpanishads could now be found prior to 1000 A.D. The text, therefore, which\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara had before his eyes, or, it may be, his ears, commands, I think, a\nhigher authority than that of any MSS. likely to be recovered at present.\n\nIt may be objected that _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's text belonged to one locality only, and\nthat different readings and different recensions may have existed in other\nparts of India. That is perfectly true. We possess various recensions of\nseveral Upanishads, as handed down in different _S_ akhas of different Vedas,\nand we know of various readings recorded by the commentators. These, where\nthey are of importance for our purposes, have been carefully taken into\naccount.\n\nIt has also been supposed that _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, who, in writing his commentaries on\nthe Upanishad, was chiefly guided by philosophical considerations, his chief\nobject being to use the Upanishads as a sacred foundation for the Vedanta\nphilosophy, may now and then have taken liberties with the text. That may be\nso, but no stringent proof of it has as yet been brought forward, and I\ntherefore hold that when we succeed in establishing throughout that text which\nserved as the basis of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's commentaries, we have done enough for the\npresent, and have fulfilled at all events the first and indispensable task in\na critical treatment of the text of the Upanishads.\n\nBut in the same manner as it is easy to see that the text\n\np. lxxii\n\nof the Rig-veda, which is presupposed by _S_ aya _n_ a's commentary and even\nby earlier works, is in many places palpably corrupt, we cannot resist the\nsame conviction with regard to the text of the Upanishads. In some cases the\nmetre, in others grammar, in others again the collation of analogous passages\nenable us to detect errors, and probably very ancient errors, that had crept\ninto the text long before _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara composed his commentaries.\n\nSome questions connected with the metres of the Upanishads have been very\nlearnedly treated by Professor Gildemeister in his essay, 'Zur Theorie des _S_\nloka.' The lesson to be derived from that essay, and from a study of the\nUpanishads, is certainly to abstain for the present from conjectural\nemendations. In the old Upanishads the same metrical freedom prevails as in\nthe hymns; in the later Upanishads, much may be tolerated as the result of\nconscious or unconscious imitation. The metrical emendations that suggest\nthemselves are generally so easy and so obvious that, for that very reason, we\nshould hesitate before correcting what native scholars would have corrected\nlong ago, if they had thought that there was any real necessity for\ncorrection.\n\nIt is easy to suggest, for instance, that in the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita-\nupanishad, verse 5, instead of tad antar asya sarvasya, tadu sarvasyasya\nbahyata _h_ , the original text may have been tad antar asya sarvasya tadu\nsarvasya bahyata _h_ ; yet _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara evidently read sarvasyasya, and as the\nsame reading is found in the text of the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita, who would\nventure to correct so old a mistake?\n\nAgain, if in verse 8, we left out yathatathyata _h_ , we should get a much\nmore regular metre,\n\nKavir manishi paribhu _h_ svyambhu _h_  \narthan vyadaha _k_ _kh_ asvatibhyai samabhya _h_.\n\nHere vyada forms one syllable by what I have proposed to call synizesis 1,\nwhich is allowed in the Upanishads as well as in the hymns. All would then\nseem right, except\n\np. lxxiii\n\nthat it is difficult to explain how so rare a word as yathatathyata _h_ could\nhave been introduced into the text.\n\nIn verse 10 one feels tempted to propose the omission of eva in anyad ahur\navidyaya, while in verse 11, an eva inserted after vidya _m_ ka would\ncertainly improve the metre.\n\nIn verse 15 the expression satyadharmaya d _ri_ sh _t_ aye is archaic, but\nperfectly legitimate in the sense of 'that we may see the nature of the True,'\nor 'that we see him whose nature is true.' When this verse is repeated in the\nMaitr. Up. VI, 35, we find instead, satyadharmaya vish _n_ ave, 'for the true\nVish _n_ u.' But here, again, no sound critic would venture to correct a\nmistake, intentional or unintentional, which is sanctioned both by the MSS. of\nthe text and by the commentary.\n\nSuch instances, where every reader feels tempted at once to correct the textus\nreceptus, occur again and again, and when they seem of any interest they have\nbeen mentioned in the notes. It may happen, however, that the correction,\nthough at first sight plausible, has to be surrendered on more mature\nconsideration. Thus in the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita-upanishad, verse 2, one\nfeels certainly inclined to write evam tve nanyatheto 'sti, instead of eva _m_\ntvayi nanyatheto 'sti. But tve, if it were used here, would probably itself\nhave to be pronounced dissyllabically, while tvayi, though it never occurs in\nthe Rig-veda, may well keep its place here, in the last book of the Va _g_\nasaneyi-sa _m_ hita, provided we pronounce it by synizesis, i. e. as one\nsyllable.\n\nAttempts have been made sometimes to go beyond _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, and to restore the\ntext, as it ought to have been originally, but as it was no longer in _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara's time. It is one thing to decline to follow _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara in every one of\nhis interpretations, it is quite another to decline to accept the text which\nhe interprets. The former is inevitable, the latter is always very precarious.\n\nThus I see, for instance, that M. Regnaud, in the Errata to the second volume\nof his excellent work on the Upanishads (Materiaux pour servir a l'histoire de\nla philosophie de l'Inde, 1878) proposes to read in the B _ri_ had-ara _n_\nyaka upanishad IV, 3, 1-8,\n\np. lxxiv\n\nsam anena vadishya iti, instead of sa mene na vadishya iti. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara adopted\nthe latter reading, and explained accordingly, that Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya went to\nking _G_ anaka, but made up his mind not to speak. M. Regnaud, reading sam\nanena vadishya iti, takes the very opposite view, namely, that Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya\nwent to king _G_ anaka, having made up his mind to have a conversation with\nhim. As M. Regnaud does not rest this emendation on the authority of any new\nMSS., we may examine it as an ingenious conjecture; but in that case it seems\nto me clear that, if we adopted it, we should have at the same time to omit\nthe whole sentence which follows. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara saw clearly that what had to be\naccounted or explained was why the king should address the Brahman first,\nsamra _d_ eva purvam papra _k_ _kh_ a; whereas if Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya had come\nwith the intention of having a conversation with the king, he, the Brahman,\nshould have spoken first. This irregularity is explained by the intervening\nsentence, in which we are reminded that on a former occasion, when _G_ anaka\nand Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya had a disputation on the Agnihotra, Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya\ngranted _G_ anaka a boon to choose, and he chose as his boon the right of\nasking questions according to his pleasure. Having received that boon, _G_\nanaka was at liberty to question Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya, even though he did not like\nit, and hence _G_ anaka is introduced here as the first to ask a question.\n\nAll this hangs well together, while if we assume that Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya came for\nthe purpose of having a conversation with _G_ anaka, the whole sentence from\n'atha ha ya _g_ _g_ anaka _s_ _k_ a' to 'purvam papra _k_ _kh_ a' would be\nuseless, nor would there be any excuse for _G_ anaka beginning the\nconversation, when Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya came himself on purpose to question him.\n\nIt is necessary, even when we feel obliged to reject an interpretation of _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara's, without at the same time altering the text, to remember that _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara, where he is not blinded by philosophical predilections, commands the\nhighest respect as an interpreter. I cannot help thinking therefore that M.\nRegnaud (vol. i, p. 59) was right in translating the passage in the _Kh_ and.\nUp. V, 3, 7, tasmad u\n\np. lxxv\n\nsarveshu lokeshu kshattrasyaiva pra _s_ asanam abhut, by 'que le kshatriya\nseul l'a enseignee dans tous les mondes.' For when he proposes in the 'Errata'\nto translate instead, '\xc3\xa7'est pourquoi l'empire dans tous les mondes fut\nattribue au kshatriya seulement,' he forgets that such an idea is foreign to\nthe ordinary atmosphere in which the Upanishads move. It is not on account of\nthe philosophical knowledge possessed by a few Kshatriyas, such as _G_ anaka\nor Pravaha _n_ a, that the privilege of government belongs everywhere to the\nsecond class. That rests on a totally different basis. Such exceptional\nknowledge, as is displayed by a few kings, might be an excuse for their\nclaiming the privileges belonging to the Brahmans, but it would never, in the\neyes of the ancient Indian \xc3\x82ryas, be considered as an argument for their\nclaiming kingly power. Therefore, although I am well aware that pra _s_ as is\nmost frequently used in the sense of ruling, I have no doubt that _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara\nlikewise was fully aware of that, and that if he nevertheless explained pra\n_s_ asana here in the sense of pra _s_ ast _ri_ tva _m_ _s_ ishya _n_ am, he\ndid so because this meaning too was admissible, particularly here, where we\nmay actually translate it by proclaiming, while the other meaning, that of\nruling, would simply be impossible in the concatenation of ideas, which is\nplaced before us in the Upanishad.\n\nIt seems, no doubt, extremely strange that neither the last redactors of the\ntext of the Upanishads, nor the commentators, who probably knew the principal\nUpanishads by heart, should have perceived how certain passages in one\nUpanishad represented the same or nearly the same text which is found in\nanother Upanishad, only occasionally with the most palpable corruptions.\n\nThus when the ceremony of offering a mantha or mash is described, we read in\nthe _Kh_ andogya-upanishad V, 2, 6, that it is to be accompanied by certain\nwords which on the whole are intelligible. But when the same passage occurs\nagain in the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka, those words have been changed to such a\ndegree, and in two different ways in the two _S_ akhas of the Madhyandinas and\nKa _n_ vas, that, though the commentator explains them, they are almost\nunintelligible.\n\np. lxxvi\n\nI shall place the three passages together in three parallel lines:\n\n1\\. _Kh_ andogya-upanishad V, 2, 6:  \nII. B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka, Madhyandina- _s_ akha, XIV, 9, 3, 10:  \nIII. B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka-upanishad, Ka _n_ va- _s_ akha, VI, 3, 5:\n\nI. Amo namasy ama hi te sarvam ida _m_ sa hi _g_ yesh _th_ a _h_  \nII. amo 'sy amam hi te mayi sa hi  \nIII. ama _m_ sy ama _m_ hi te mahi sa hi\n\nI. sresh _th_ o ra _g_ adhipati _h_ sa ma _g_ yaish _th_ ya _m_ _s_ rai-  \nII. ra _g_ e _s_ ano 'dhipati _h_ sa ma ra _g_ e _s_ ano  \nIII. ra _g_ e _s_ ano\n\nI. sh _th_ ya _m_ ra _g_ yam adhipatya _m_ gamayatv aham eveda _m_  \nII. 'dhipati _m_ karotv iti.  \nIII. 'dhipati _m_ karotv iti.\n\nI. sarvam asaniti.  \nII.  \nIII.\n\nThe text in the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad yields a certain sense, viz. 'Thou art\nAma by name, for all this together exists in thee. He is the oldest and best,\nthe king, the sovereign. May he make me the oldest, the best, the king, the\nsovereign. May I be all this.' This, according to the commentator, is\naddressed to Pra _n_ a, and Ama, though a purely artificial word, is used in\nthe sense of Pra _n_ a, or breath, in another passage also, viz. B _ri_ had-\nara _n_ yaka-up. I, 3, 22. If therefore we accept this meaning of Ama, the\nrest is easy and intelligible.\n\nBut if we proceed to the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka, in the Madhyandina- _s_\nakha, we find the commentator proposing the following interpretation: 'O\nMantha, thou art a full knower, complete knowledge of me belongs to thee.'\nThis meaning is obtained by deriving ama _h_ from a \\+ man, in the sense of\nknower, and then taking amam, as a neuter, in the sense of knowledge,\nderivations which are simply impossible.\n\nLastly, if we come to the text of the Ka _n_ va-sakha, the grammatical\ninterpretation becomes bolder still. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara does not explain the passage\nat all, which is strange, but \xc3\x82nandagiri interprets ama _m_ si tvam by 'Thou\nknowest\n\np. lxxvii\n\n[paragraph continues] (all),' and ama _m_ hi te mahi, by 'we know thy great\n(shape),' which are again impossible forms.\n\nBut although there can be little doubt here that the reading of the _Kh_\nandogya-upanishad gives us the original text, or a text nearest to the\noriginal, no sound critic would venture to correct the readings of the B _ri_\nhad-ara _n_ yaka. They are corruptions, but even as corruptions they possess\nauthority, at all events up to a certain point, and it is the fixing of those\ncertain points or chronological limits, which alone can impart a scientific\ncharacter to our criticism of ancient texts.\n\nIn the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a-upanishad Professor Cowell has pointed out a\npassage to me, where we must go beyond the text as it stood when commented on\nby the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda. In the beginning of the fourth adhyaya all MSS. of the\ntext read savasan, and this is the reading which the commentator seems anxious\nto explain, though not very successfully. I thought that possibly the\ncommentator might have had before him the reading sa vasan, or so 'vasan, but\nboth would be very unusual. Professor Cowell in his Various Readings, p. xii,\nconjectured sa _m_ vasan, which would be liable to the same objection. He now,\nhowever, informs me that, as B. has sa _m_ tvan, and C. satvan, he believes\nthe original text to have been Satvan-Matsyeshu. This seems to me quite\nconvincing, and is borne out by the reading of the Berlin MS., so far as it\ncan be made out from Professor Weber's essay on the Upanishads, Indische\nStudien I, p.419. I see that Boehtlingk and Roth in their Sanskrit Dictionary,\ns _v_. satvat, suggest the same emendation.\n\nThe more we study the nature of Sanskrit MSS., the more, I believe, we shall\nfeel convinced that their proper arrangement is one by locality rather than by\ntime. I have frequently dwelt on this subject in the introductions to the\nsuccessive volumes of my edition of the Rig-veda and its commentary by Saya\n_n_ a _k_ arya, and my convictions on this point have become stronger ever\nsince. A MS., however modern, from the south of India or from the north, is\nmore important as a check on the textus receptus of\n\np. lxxviii\n\nany Sanskrit work, as prevalent in Bengal or Bombay, than ever so many MSS.,\neven if of greater antiquity, from the same locality. When therefore I was\ninformed by my friend Dr. Buhler that he had discovered in Kashmir a MS. of\nthe Aitareya-upanishad, I certainly expected some real help from such a\ntreasure. The MS. is described by its discoverer in the last number of the\njournal of the Bombay Asiatic Society, p. 34 1, and has since been sent to me\nby the Indian Government. It is written on birch bark (bhur _g_ a), and in the\nalphabet commonly called _S_ arada. The leaves are very much injured on the\nmargin and it is almost impossible to handle them without some injury. In many\nplaces the bark has shrunk, probably on being moistened, and the letters have\nbecome illegible. Apart from these drawbacks, there remain the difficulties\ninherent in the _S_ arada alphabet which, owing to its numerous combinations,\nis extremely difficult to read, and very trying to eyes which are growing\nweak. However, I collated the Upanishad from the Aitareya-ara _n_ yaka, which\nturned out to be the last portion only, viz. the Sa _m_ hita-upanishad (Ait.\n\xc3\x82r. III, 1-2), or, as it is called here, Sa _m_ hitara _n_ ya, and I am sorry\nto say my expectations have been disappointed. The MS. shows certain graphic\npeculiarities which Dr. Buhler has pointed out. It is particularly careful in\nthe use of the sibilants, replacing the Visarga by sibilants, writing s + s\nand _s_ \\+ _s_ instead of _h_ \\+ s and _h_ \\+ _s_ ; distinguishing also the\n_G_ ihvamuliya and Upadhmaniya. If therefore the MS. writes antastha, we may\nbe sure that it really meant to write so, and not anta _h_ stha, or, as it\nwould have written, antasstha. It shows equal care in the use of the nasals,\nand generally carries on the sandhi between different paragraphs. Here and\nthere I met with better readings than those given in Rajendralal Mitra's\nedition, but in most cases the commentary would have been sufficient to\nrestore the right reading. A few various readings, which seemed to deserve\nbeing mentioned, will be found\n\np. lxxix\n\nin the notes. The MS., though carefully written, is not free from the ordinary\nblunders. At first one feels inclined to attribute some importance to every\npeculiarity of a new MS., but very soon one finds out that what seems\npeculiar, is in reality carelessness. Thus Ait. \xc3\x82r. III, I, 5, 2, the Kashmir\nMS. has purvam akshara _m_ rupam, instead of what alone can be right,\npurvarupam. Instead of pragaya pa _s_ ubhi _h_ it writes repeatedly pra _g_\naya pa _s_ ubhi _h_ , which is impossible. In III, 2, 2, it leaves out again\nand again manomaya between _kh_ andomaya and va\xe1\xb9\x85maya; but that this is a mere\naccident we learn later on, where in the same sentence manomayo, is found in\nits right place. Such cases reduce this MS. to its proper level, and make us\nlook with suspicion on any accidental variations, such as I have noticed in my\ntranslation.\n\nThe additional paragraph, noticed by Dr. Buhler, is very indistinct, and\ncontains, so far as I am able to find out, santi verses only.\n\nI have no doubt that the discovery of new MSS. of the Upanishads and their\ncommentaries will throw new light on the very numerous difficulties with which\na translator of the Upanishads, particularly in attempting a complete and\nfaithful translation, has at present to grapple. Some of the difficulties,\nwhich existed thirty years ago, have been removed since by the general\nprogress of Vedic scholarship, and by the editions of texts and commentaries\nand translations of Upanishads, many of which were known at that time in\nmanuscript only. But I fully agree with M. Regnaud as to the difficultes\nconsiderables que les meilleures traductions laissent subsister, and which can\nbe solved only by a continued study of the Upanishads, the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, the\nBrahma _n_ as, and the Vedanta-sutras.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxxii:1](sbe01014.htm#fr_38) Rig-veda, translated by M.
