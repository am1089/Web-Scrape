And for the same reason the holding together and the pervading the sky\n(attributed to Brahman in the Ra _n_ ayaniya-khila) (are not to be inserted in\nother vidyas).\n\nIn the khilas (supplementary writings) of the Ra _n_ ayaniyas we meet with a\npassage, 'Held together are the powers among which Brahman is the best; the\nbest Brahman in the beginning stretched out the sky 1,' which mentions certain\nenergies of Brahman, such as holding together its powers, entering into the\nsky, &c. And in the\n\np. 219\n\nUpanishad of the same (i.e. the Ra _n_ ayaniyas) we meet with vidyas of\nBrahman among which the Sa _n_ _d_ ilya-vidya is the first.--The question then\narises whether the energies of Brahman just mentioned are to be inserted in\nthose Brahma-vidyas or not. To the purvapaksha view that they are to be so\ninserted because they are connected with Brahman, the Sutrakara replies that\nthe holding together and pervading the sky are not to be inserted in the Sa\n_n_ _d_ ilya-vidya and other vidyas, for the same reason, i.e. on account of\ntheir being connected with different abodes. In the _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya-vidya,\nBrahman is said to have its abode in the heart, 'He is the Self within the\nheart' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 3); the same statement is made in the dahara-\nvidya, 'There is the palace, the small lotus (of the heart), and in it that\nsmall ether' (VIII, 1, 1). In the Upako _s_ ala-vidya again, Brahman is said\nto reside within the eye, 'That person that is seen in the eye' (IV, 15, 1).\nIn all these vidyas Brahman is described as residing within the body; it is\ntherefore impossible to insert into them the energies of Brahman which the\nkhila of the Ra _n_ ayaniyas mentions, and which are connected with the Devas\n(i.e. external nature).--But the vidyas of the _Kh_ andogya likewise mention\nsuch powers of Brahman as are connected with the Devas; cp. e.g. III, 14, 3,\n'He is greater than the heaven, greater than these worlds;' IV, 15, 4, 'He is\nalso Bhamani, for he shines in all worlds;' VIII, 1, 3, 'As large as this\nether is, so large is that ether within the heart. Both heaven and earth are\ncontained within it.' And again there are other vidyas of Brahman, such as the\none which represents Brahman as comprising sixteen parts, in which not any\nspecial abode is mentioned.--True; but there is a special reason why the\nattributes stated in the Ra _n_ ayaniya-khila cannot be introduced into the\nother vidyas. Particulars mentioned in one place can indeed be inserted in\nvidyas met with in another place if the latter are suggested to the mind by\ncontaining some reference to agreeing particulars; the qualities of holding\ntogether, however, on one side and those mentioned in the Sa _n_ _d_ ilya-\nvidya, &c., on the other side are of such a nature as to exclude each\n\np. 220\n\nother, and therefore do not mutually suggest each other. The mere circumstance\nof all the particulars being connected with Brahman does not suffice to\nsuggest vidyas occurring in other places; for even in vidyas which are\navowedly separate, all the particulars may be connected with Brahman. And it\nis an established fact that Brahman, although one only, is, owing to the\nplurality of its powers, meditated upon in more than one way, as shown under\nSutra 7.--The conclusion therefore is that the attributes of holding together\nits powers and so on are not to be inserted in the Sa _n_ _d_ ilya. and\nsimilar vidyas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[218:1](sbe38166.htm#fr_142) Virya virya _n_ i parakramabheda _h_ , anye hi\npurusha _h_ sahayan apekshya vikraman bibhrati tena tatparakrama _n_ am na ta\neva niyat-apurvatvarupakara _n_ atvena gyesh _th_ a bhavanti ki _m_ tu\ntatsahakari _n_ o \xe0\xa4\xbdpi, brahmavirya _n_ a _m_ tu brahmaiva _g_ yesh _th_ a _m_\nbrahma _g_ yesh _th_ a _m_ yesha _m_ tani tatha brahma khalv ananyapeksha _m_\n_g_ aga _g_ _g_ anmadi karoti.
