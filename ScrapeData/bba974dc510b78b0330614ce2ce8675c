Then 2 \xc4\x80\xc5\x9bwal\xc4\x81yana went to Lord Paramesht\xc4\xab (Brahm\xc4\x81) and addressed Him\nthus: "Please initiate me into Brahmavi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 (Divine Wisdom), which is the most\nexcellent, which is ever enjoyed by the wise, which is mystic, and by which\nthe learned, after having soon freed themselves from all sins, reach Purusha,\nthe Supreme of the supreme."\n\nTo him the Grandfather (thus);replied: "Know (It) through \xc5\x9ara\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81 (faith),\nBhak\xe1\xb9\xadi (devotion), \xe1\xb8\x8chy\xc4\x81na (meditation), and Yoga. Persons attain salvation not\nthrough Karma, progeny or wealth but through Sanny\xc4\x81sa (renunciation) alone.\nAscetics of pure mind through (the realisation of) the meaning well-\nascertained by Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada-Vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and through \xc5\x9aanny\xc4\x81sa-Yoga enter into That which\nis above Swarga (heaven) and is in the cave (of the heart). They all attain\nParam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 3 in the Brahma-world and are (finally) emancipated.\n\n"Being seated in a pleasant posture in an unfrequented place with a pure mind,\nand with his neck, head, and body erect, having given up the duties of the\n(four) orders of life, having subjugated all the organs, having saluted his\nGuru with devotion, having looked upon the heart (-lotus) as being free from\nRajogu\xe1\xb9\x87a and as pure, and having contemplated in its (heart\'s) centre\nParame\xc5\x9bwara who is always with His consort \xc5\xaama, who is pure and free from\nsorrow, who is unthinkable and invisible, who is of endless forms, who is of\nthe nature of happiness,\n\np. 32\n\nwho is very quiescent, who is of the form of emancipation, who is the source\nof M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81, who has no beginning, middle or end, who is One, who is All-\nPervading, who is Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da (Consciousness-Bliss), who is formless, who is\nwonderful, who is the Lord (of all), who has three eyes, who has a blue neck,\n(N\xc4\xablaka\xe1\xb9\x87tha), and who is serenity (itself)--the Muni attains Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, the\nwomb of all elements, the All-Witness, and above lamas. He only is Brahma. He\nonly is \xc5\x9aiva. He only is In\xe1\xb8\x8dra. He only is the indestructible. He only is the\nSupreme. He only is the Self-Shining. He only is Vish\xe1\xb9\x87\xc5\xab. He only is Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. He\nonly is Time. He only is Agni (fire). He only is the moon. He only is all\nthings that exist or will hereafter exist. He only is eternal. Having known\nHim, one crosses death. There is no other path to salvation. He only attains\nParabrahman who sees in himself all elements and himself in all elements.\nThere is no other means. Having constituted his body an Ara\xe1\xb9\x87i (the lower\nattritional piece of wood) and Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om), the upper Ara\xe1\xb9\x87i, a wise man burns\nAj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na by the churning of meditation.\n\n"It is only He (Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) who, deluded by M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81, assumes a body with the\ninternal organs and does everything. It is only He who in the waking state is\ngratified with women, food, drink, and other diverse enjoyments. In the\ndreaming state, the J\xc4\xabva enjoys pleasures and pains in the several worlds\nwhich are created by His M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81. In the dreamless sleeping state when all are\nabsorbed, He, replete with \xe1\xb9\xacamas, attains the state of happiness. Then through\nthe force of the Karmas of previous births, that J\xc4\xabva again wakes up and goes\nto sleep. All the diversified objects (of the universe) emanate from the J\xc4\xabva,\nwho sports in the three bodies (gross, subtle and causal). The three bodies\nare finally absorbed in Him who is the source of all, who is Bliss, and who is\nAbsolute Wisdom. From Him, arise Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, Manas, all the organs of sense and\naction, \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, V\xc4\x81yu, Agni, water and the earth supporting all. Parabrahman,\nwhich is of all forms, which is the Supreme Abode of this universe, which is\nthe most subtle of the subtle and which is eternal, is only yourself. You are\n\np. 33\n\nonly That. One who knows himself to be that Parabrahman that shines as the\nuniverse in the waking, dreaming, dreamless and other states, will be relieved\nfrom all bondage. I am that Sa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xc5\x9biva, (or the eternal happiness) who is other\nthan the enjoyer, the enjoyed, and the enjoyment in the three seats (or\nbodies), and who is witness and Chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. All emanate from Me alone. All\nexist in Me alone. All merge into Me alone. I am that non-dual Brahman. I am\nthe atom of atoms; so am I the biggest (of all). I am this diversified\nuniverse. I am the oldest of all. I am Purusha. I am \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9ba (the Lord). I am of\nthe form of Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis (light) and of the form of happiness. I have neither hands\nnor feet. I have power unthinkable. I see without eyes. I hear without ears. I\nam omniscient. I have one kind of form only. None is able to know Me fully. I\nam always of the form of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad. I am the One that should be known through all\nthe Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. I am the Guru who revealed the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada. I am only He who knows the\ntrue meaning of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada. I have no sins or virtues. I have no destruction. I\nhave no birth, body, organs of sense or action, or Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. To Me there is no\nearth, water or fire. There is no V\xc4\x81yu; there is no \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. He who thinks\nParam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as being in the cave (of the heart), as having no form, as being\nsecondless, as being the witness of all and as being neither Sa\xe1\xb9\xad nor Asa\xe1\xb9\xad,\nattains the pure form of Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.\n\n"Whoever recites this Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d belonging to Yajurve\xe1\xb8\x8da, he becomes as pure as\nAgni (fire). He becomes purified from the sins of theft of gold. He becomes\npurified from the sins of drinking alcohol. He becomes purified from the sins\nof murder of a Brahman. He becomes purified from the sins of commission (of\nthose that ought not to be done) and the sins of omission (of those that ought\nto be done). Therefore he becomes a follower of Br\xc4\x81hman. Were one who has\nstepped beyond the duties of the four orders of life to recite (this\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d) always or even once, he acquires the wisdom that destroys the ocean\nof Sams\xc4\x81ra. Therefore having known Him, he attains the Kaivalya State (or\nstate of isolation or emancipation)--yea, he attains the Kaivalya State."\n\nOm-\xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad-Sa\xe1\xb9\xad.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[31:1](tmu07.htm#fr_7) Lit., isolation- or emancipation-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n[31:2](tmu07.htm#fr_8) After attaining S\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhana-Cha\xe1\xb9\xadushtaya or the four means\nof salvation.\n\n[31:3](tmu07.htm#fr_9) Hira\xe1\xb9\x87yagarbha or the higher Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 6.
