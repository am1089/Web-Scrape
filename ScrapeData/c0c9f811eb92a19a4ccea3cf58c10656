Hearing these words of Vyasa Deva S\xc2\x92uka Deva said :-- O Father! I do not\nlike at all to take to a householder's life; as I see clearly that it fastens\nmen, as a cord fastens animals, and is a source of incessant pain. O Father!\nWhere can you expect happiness from a householder who is always loaded with\nanxiety how and whence to get wealth? Those, who have greed for wealth,\noppress their poor relatives, even; and extort money. Even one who is the lord\nof the three worlds, who\n\n\n\np. 52\n\n\n\nis their Indra, he also is not so happy as a beggar, that has no desires. See,\nthen, who else can be happy in this world? Whenever an ascetic is seen to\npractise severe asceticism, Indra, the lord of the Devas becomes anxious and\nsorry, and raises various obstacles in his way. See also that Brahma is not\nhappy with his big samsara (his creation which is his house). Bhagavan Vi _sn_\nu, though He has got His beautiful Kamala, the presiding Deity of all wealth\nand prosperity, is always suffering, since He is incessantly engaged in\nfighting with the Asuras; and though He is the husband of Lak _s_ mi and full\nof prosperity, He practises, almost, every now and then, terrible asceticism\nwith great care and earnestness. So who else is there, who is possessed of\nconstant happiness? I know also Bhagavan S'ankara, too, suffers incessant\ntroubles and has to fight against the Daityas. So, then, O Father: how can a\npoor householder be happy when the rich householder cannot sleep happily, with\nhis constant care for wealth. O highly fortunate one! Knowing full well this\ntruth of the world, why are you plunging me, your son, in this terrible\nSamsara, full of pains and agonies.\n\n\n\nO Father! What shall I say to you about the miseries of the world! There is\npain in birth, pain in old age, pain in death, and pain in the life in the\nwomb full of urines and faeces; but the pain, arising from desire and greed,\nis more terrible than all the pains mentioned above; and then, the pains\nexperienced while asking for them are greater than the pangs of death. Alas!\nThere is no other way for the Brahmans to earn their livelihood than to accept\ngifts from others. Therefore the Brahmans have to suffer daily death-like\npangs in having to wait in expectation from others; can there be anything more\nregrettable than this? The Brahma _n_ as, studying all the Vedas and Dharma\nS'astras and acquiring wisdom, have got at last to go to the rich and praise\nthem (in expectation of some money) carefully. O Father! if one does not\nbecome a householder, then what care is there to feed one's own belly? If\nthere be contentment in the mind, any how the belly can be filled with leaves,\nroots and fruits; but if there be wife, sons and grandsons and many dependent\nrelatives, then to feed them all, much trouble and anxiety are experienced. So\nhow can you expect, O Father! perfect happiness in the world? So teach me, O\nFather! the S\xc2\x92astras on Yoga and eternal truth that will give perfect\nhappiness; no advice in karma kan _d_ a (the series of actions) will bring me\npleasure. Now advise me how the karmas can be exhausted; how the root of the\nthree sorts of karmas, Sanchita, Prarabdha, and Vartamana, giving torments of\nbirth, death, etc., the Avidya, the great ignorance, can be destroyed? The\nfools do not understand how the women suck the blood out of persons like\nleeches, for they get themselves deluded by their gestures and postures! The\nlady of the house, whom the people\n\n\n\np. 53\n\n\n\ncall kanta, the beautiful one, steal away the semen virile, the strength and\nenergy in the way of giving them happiness as sexual intercourse, and their\nminds and wealth and everything by their crooked love conversations; so see\nwhat greater thief can there be than a woman? In my opinion, those that are\nignorant are certainly deluded by the Creator; they accept wife to destroy\ntheir own pleasure of happiness. They can never understand that the women can\nnever be the source of pleasure; they are the source of all miseries. Hearing\nthese words of S\xc2\x92uka, Vyasa became merged in the deep sea of cares and\nanxieties, thinking what to do then. The incessant tears of pain flowed from\nhis eyes; his whole body began to shiver and his mind became too much worried.\n\n\n\nSeeing this distressed and sorrowful state of his father, S'ukdeva, with eyes\nfull of wonder, said :-- Oh! What a power has Maya got?\n\n\n\nOh! He, whose words are accepted by all, with great love and care as\nequivalent to the Vedas, who is the author of the Vedanta Dars'ana, and before\nwhom nothing is veiled in ignorance, Oh! that greatest Pundit, the knower of\nall the Tattvas, is now deluded by Maya? Oh! what is that Maya who has been\nable to delude Vyasa Deva, the son of Satyavati, so skilled in the knowledge\nof Brahma Vidya; I also do not know how, with what great care, one is to\npractise Sadhana towards Her.\n\n\n\nAlas! He who has composed eighteen Maha Pura _n_ as and the great Maha\nBharata, who has divided the Vedas in four parts, the same Veda Vyas has today\nbeen deluded by the power of Maya! What to speak of other persons! Oh! Maya\nhas deluded Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes'vara and others and the whole universe;\nthen who is there in the three worlds that is not fascinated by Her influence!\nI therefore, take refuge unto the Internal Governess, the Devi Maha Maya. Oh!\nwhat wonderful power She wields? By her own Mayic power, She has kept God even\nunder Her control, who is omniscient and the Controller of all. The Pundits,\nwho know the Pura _n_ as say, that Vyasa Deva is born of the part of Vi _sn_\nu; but, see the wonder, that he is today plunged in the sea of delusion like a\nmerchant whose ship has been wrecked. Alas! How great is the wonderful power\nof Maya! The all-knowing Vyasa is today under the control of Maya and is\nweeping like an ordinary man! So I have come to the firm conclusion that the\nwise Pundits are incapable to surpass the strength of Maya. What a great error\narises through the power of Maya! See! indeed!! who is he and who am I? What\nfor we have come here? There is no certainty, nothing whatsoever, about that.\nAnd, see, also, how he has got the nice idea of \xc2\x93father\xc2\x94 on his body and the\nidea of \xc2\x93his son\xc2\x94 in my body, that are composed of five elements.\n\n\n\np. 54\n\n\n\nThis is now quite evident to me that, when the Brahmin Mahar _s_ i Kri _sn_ a\nDvaipayan is weeping under the influence of Maya, She is the strongest of all;\neven those who are skilled in the great Maya fall under Her prey.\n\n\n\nThen S\xc2\x92uka Deva bowed down mentally to the Devi, Maha Maya, who is the\nCreatrix of Brahma and the other Devas and who is the Controller of them all;\nand then began to speak the following auspicious words pregnant with reason,\nto his father Vyasa Deva, greatly distressed and plunged in the sea of sorrows\n:-- \xc2\x93O Father! you are exceedingly fortunate, for you are the son of the high\nsouled Paras'ara and you yourself are the instructor of real truth, the tattva\njnana, to all persons; so, O Lord! why are you giving vent to sorrows, like an\nordinary bewildered man? O Mahabhaga! why are you plunging yourself in this\ngreat error, though you are a high souled personage! See, it is quite true\nthat now I am born as your son; but this I don't know what relation existed\nbetween you and me in my previous birth? So, O highly intelligent one! Open\nyour eyes of wisdom, and be patient; do not throw yourself, in vain, in the\nsea of sorrows. All this universe is like a net of delusion; knowing this,\nabandon all your grief; why are you feeling yourself so much weak and\ndistressed, for your attachment towards your son? Hunger is satisfied by\neating something, and thirst is satisfied by the drinking of water; hunger is\nnot satisfied by seeing the son. So the organ of scent is satisfied by\nsmelling sweet scents; and the organ of hearing is satisfied by hearing sweet\nmusic; and when thirst arises to enjoy women, that is satisfied only by sexual\nintercourse; but what satisfaction can a son give? So what shall I do to you\nby remaining as your son? The son, in fact, is not the cause of any\nsatisfaction to one's self. For this reason, in ancient days, the poor Brahmin\nAjigarta gave his son to the king Harischandra, for necessary equivalent price\nin money, who wanted a man for his sacrifice where human beings are to be\nsacrificed as victims. In fact, those things that are urgently required as\nnecessities give happiness; and all these articles can be obtained by wealth;\nso if you want to enjoy happiness, then earn money; of what use shall I be to\nyou as your son? O Muni! you can see subtle things and you are greatly\nintelligent; so I pray to you, to look upon me as your son and open my eyes of\nwisdom, that I can be free for ever from this womb of birth. O Sinless one! To\nget a human birth in this land of Karma (in India) is very difficult; again to\nget a Brahmin birth is extremely rare; so when I have got this so very rare\nbirth, why shall I spend my time in vain? O Father! Though I have served many\nspiritual teachers, fraught with wisdom, for many years, yet the firm idea \xc2\x93I\nam, as it were, bound up in this net of Samsara\xc2\x94 the notion covered with dark\ndarkness of ignorance, caused by desires, this net of Samsara does not leave\nme.\n\n\n\np. 55\n\n\n\nWhen the son S\xc2\x92uka Deva of extraordinary power and intelligence spoke thus,\nVyasa saw that his son was strongly inclined to take to the four \xc3\x82s'ram, that\nof Sannyasa and spoke thus :-- O Son! If your mind has become so, then read\nBhagavat Pura _n_ a, composed by me, highly auspicious, voluminous, and the\nsecond Vedas.\n\n\n\nIn this you have the chapters on Creation (Sarga) and secondary creation (upa\nsarga), etc., the five characteristics as in other Pura _n_ as and it is sub-\ndivided into twelve Skandhas. Hearing of this Bhagavata brings up to the mind\nthat Brahma alone is real and all the universe is unreal and knowledge both\nintuitive and indirect springs up. For this very reason, the Bhagavata\ntreatise is considered as the ornament of the Pura _n_ as. Therefore, O highly\nintelligent one! you better study the Pura _n_ a. O Child! In days of yore, at\nthe end of a Kalpa, Bhagavan Hari was lying, as a small child on a floating\nleaf of a banyan tree, and was thinking thus :-- \xc2\x93Who is the Intelligent One\nthat has created me a small child? What is His object? Of what stuff am I made\nof? and how am I created? whence can I know all this?\xc2\x94 At this moment the Devi\nBhagavati Who is all chaitanya, seeing the high-souled Bhagavan Hari musing\nthus, spoke out in the form of a celestial voice in the following half-\nstanza:-- \xc2\x93All this that is seen is I Myself; there is existent nothing other\nthat is eternal.\xc2\x94 Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, then, began to think deeply the above\ncelestial voice :-- \xc2\x93Who has uttered this word, pregnant of truth, to me? How\nshall I come to know the speaker, whether that is female, male or a\nhermaphrodite?\xc2\x94 Pondering over this for a long time, when he could not come to\na definite conclusion, he began to repeat (make japam) frequently that word of\nBhagavati with a whole heart. When Hari, lying on a banyan tree leaf, became\nvery anxious to know what the above words implied, then the all-auspicious\nDevi Bhagavati with a beautiful face, calm and quiet appearance, appeared\nbefore Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, of unrivalled splendour, in the form of Maha Lak\n_s_ mi, who is all of Sattva Gu _n_ a, surrounded by Her Vibhutis, Her\nmanifestations of attendents, Her smiling companions of the same age, decked\nwith ornaments, and wearing divine clothings, and holding each in their four\ndivine hands, conch shell, disc, club, and lotus.\n\n\n\nThe lotus eyed Vi _sn_ u was very much surprised to see that beautiful Devi,\nstanding without anything to rest on that water; He saw that on four sides of\nthe Devi, were staying Rati, Bhuti, Buddhi, Mati, Kirti, Smriti, Dhriti,\nS'raddha, Medha, Svadha, Svaha, Kshudha, Nidra, Daya, Gati, Tu _st_ i, Pu _st_\ni, K _s_ ama, Lajja, Jrimbha Tandra and other personified forces, each\npossessing a clear distinct form, and endowed with a clear distinct feeling.\nIn the hands of them all were divine weapons; on their necks, necklaces and\ngarlands of\n\n\n\np. 56\n\n\n\nMandara flowers; and all the limbs of their bodies were decorated with divine\nornaments. Seeing in that one mass of ocean the Devi Lak _s_ mi and Her\nS'aktis, Bhagavan Janardan, the soul of all, became greatly astonished and\nthought within Himself thus :-- \xc2\x93What is this? Is this Maya that I am\nwitnessing? Whence have appeared these women? and whence have I come here,\nlying on this banyan leaf? How has the banyan tree come to existence in this\none mass of ocean? And who is it, that has placed me here in the form of a\nchild? Is this my Mother? Or is this some Maya that can create impossible\nthings?\n\n\n\nWhy has She made Herself manifest before me now? Or is there some hidden\nmotive that She has appeared thus? What ought I to do now? Or shall I go to\nsome other place? or shall I continue remaining here in this form of the\nchild, silent and with vigilance.\n\n\n\nThus ends the fifteenth chapter of the 1st Skandha on the dispassion of S'uka\nand the instructions of Bhagavati to Hari in the Mahapura _n_ a S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 16](bk01ch16.htm)\n\n"
