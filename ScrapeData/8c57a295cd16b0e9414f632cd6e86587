Charm for the prosperity of cattle.\n\n1\\. Hither shall come the cattle which have strayed to a distance, whose\ncompanionship Vayu (the wind) enjoys! (The cattle) whose structure of form\nTvashtar knows, Savitar shall hold in place in this stable!  \n2\\. To this stable the cattle shall flow together, Brihaspati skilfully shall\nconduct them hither! Sinivali shall conduct hither their van: do thou, O\nAnumati, hold them in place after they have arrived!  \n3\\. May the cattle, may the horses, and may the domestics flow together; may\nthe increase of the grain flow together! I sacrifice with an oblation that\ncauseth to flow together!  \n4\\. I pour together the milk of the cows, I pour together strength and sap\nwith the ghee. Poured together shall be our heroes, constant shall be the cows\nwith me the owner of the cows!  \n5\\. I bring hither the milk of the cows, I have brought hither the sap of the\ngrain. Brought hither are our heroes, brought hither to this house are our\nwives.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 14.
