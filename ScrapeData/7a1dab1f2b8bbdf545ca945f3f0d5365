(If) rhinoceros\' meat (is given to Brahma _n_ as seated) on (seats covered\nwith) the skin of a rhinoceros, (the Manes are satisfied) for a very long\ntime. 1\n\n2\\. (The same effect is obtained) by (offering the) flesh (of the fish called)\n_S_ atabali, 2\n\n3\\. And by (offering the) meat of the (crane called) Vardhra _n_ asa.\n\n4\\. Pure, with composed mind and full of ardour, he shall feed Brahma _n_ as\nwho know the Vedas, and who are not connected with him by marriage, blood\nrelationship, by the relationship of sacrificial priest and sacrificer, or by\nthe relationship of (teacher and) pupil. 4\n\n5\\. If strangers are deficient in the (requisite) good qualities, even a full\nbrother who possesses them, may be fed (at a _S_ raddha).\n\n6\\. (The admissibility of) pupils (and the rest) has been declared hereby.\n\n7\\. Now they quote also (in regard to this matter the following verse):\n\n8\\. The food eaten (at a sacrifice) by persons related to the giver is,\nindeed, a gift offered to the goblins. It reaches neither the Manes nor the 8\n\np. 144\n\ngods. Losing its power (to procure heaven), it errs about in this world as a\ncow that has lost its calf runs into a strange stable.\n\n9\\. The meaning (of the verse) is, that gifts which are eaten (and offered)\nmutually by relations, (and thus go) from one house to the other, perish in\nthis world.\n\n10\\. If the good qualities (of several persons who might be invited) are\nequal, old men and (amongst these) poor ones, who wish to come, have the\npreference.\n\n11\\. On the day before (the ceremony) the (first) invitation (must be issued).\n11\n\n12\\. On the following day the second invitation takes place. 12\n\n13\\. (On the same day also takes place) the third invitation (which consists\nin the call to dinner). 13\n\n14\\. Some declare, that every act at a funeral sacrifice must be repeated\nthree times.\n\n15\\. As (the acts are performed) the first time, so they must be repeated) the\nsecond and the third times.\n\n16\\. When all (the three oblations) have been 16\n\np. 145\n\noffered, he shall take a portion of the food of all (three), and shall eat a\nsmall mouthful of the remainder in the manner described (in the G _ri_ hya-\nsutra).\n\n17\\. But the custom of the Northerners is to pour into the hands of the Brahma\n_n_ as, when they are seated on their seats, (water which has been taken from\nthe water-vessel.) 17\n\n18\\. (At the time of the burnt-offering which is offered at the beginning of\nthe dinner) he addresses the Brahma _n_ as with this Mantra: \'Let it be taken\nout, and let it be offered in the fire.\' 18\n\n19\\. (They shall give their permission with this Mantra): \'Let it be taken out\nat thy pleasure, let it be offered in the fire at thy pleasure.\' Having\nreceived this permission, he shall take out (some of the prepared food) and\noffer it.\n\n20\\. They blame it, if dogs and Apapatras are allowed to see the performance\nof a funeral-sacrifice.\n\n21\\. The following persons defile the company if they are invited to a\nfuneral-sacrifice, viz. a leper, a bald man, the violator of another man\'s\nbed, the son of a Brahma _n_ a who follows the profession of a Kshatriya, and\nthe son of (a Brahma _n_ a who by marrying first a _S_ udra wife had himself\nbecome) a _S_ udra, born from a Brahma _n_ a woman. 21\n\np. 146\n\n22\\. The following persons sanctify the company if they eat at a funeral-\nsacrifice, viz. one who has studied the three verses of the Veda containing\nthe word \'Madhu,\' each three times; one who has studied the part of the Veda\ncontaining the word \'Supar _n_ a\' three times; a Tri _n_ a _k_ iketa; one who\nhas studied the Mantras required for the four sacrifices (called A _s_\nvamedha, Purushamedha, Sarvamedha, and Pit _ri_ medha); one who keeps five\nfires; one who knows the Saman called _G_ yesh _th_ a; one who fulfils the\nduty of daily study; the son of one who has studied and is able to teach the\nwhole Veda with its A\xe1\xb9\x85gas, and a _S_ rotriya. 22\n\n23\\. He shall not perform (any part of) a funeral sacrifice at night. 23\n\n24\\. After having begun (a funeral-sacrifice), he shall not eat until he has\nfinished it. 24\n\n25\\. (He shall not perform a funeral-sacrifice at 25\n\np. 147\n\nnight), except if an eclipse of the moon takes place.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[143:1](sbe0252.htm#fr_691) **17**.

According to\nHaradatta the formula of invitation is, _S_ va _h_ _s_ raddham bhavita,\ntatrahavaniyarthe bhavadbhi _h_ prasade kartavya iti, \'to-morrow a _S_ raddha\nwill take place.

Haradatta\'s explanation of the word \' _S_ udra\' by \'a\nBrahma _n_ a who has become a _S_ udra\' is probably not because the son of a\nreal _S_ udra and of a Brahma _n_ a female is a Ka _n_ _d_ ala, and has been\ndisposed of by the preceding Sutra.\n\n[146:22](sbe0252.htm#fr_702) Compare Manu III, 185, 186; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I,\n219-221. The three verses to be known by a Trimadhu are, Madhu vata _ri_\ntayate, &c., which occur both in the Taitt. Sa _m_ h. and in the Taitt. \xc3\x82r.\nThe explanation of Trisupar _n_ a is not certain. Haradatta thinks that it may\nmean either a person who knows the three verses _K_ atushkaparda yuvati _h_\nsupe _s_ a, &c., Taittiriya-brahma _n_ a I, 2, 1, 27, &c., or one who knows\nthe three Anuvakas from the Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 48-50, beginning,\nBrahmametu mam, &c. The word \'Tri _n_ a _k_ iketa\' has three explanations:--\n_a_. A person who knows the Na _k_ iketa-fire according to the Taittiriyaka,\nKa _th_ avalli, and the _S_ atapatha, i.e. has studied the portions on the Na\n_k_ iketa-fire in these three books. _b_. A person who has thrice kindled the\nNa _k_ iketa-fire. _c_. A person who has studied the Anuvaka, called Vira _g_\nas. _K_ aturmedha may also mean \'one who has performed the four sacrifices\'\nenumerated above.\n\n[146:23](sbe0252.htm#fr_703) Manu III, 280.\n\n[146:24](sbe0252.htm#fr_704) \'The _S_ raddha is stated to begin with the first\ninvitation to the Brahmans.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[146:25](sbe0252.htm#fr_705) \'The Northerners do not generally receive this\nSutra, and therefore former commentators have not explained it.\'--Haradatta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 8, Kha _n_ _d_ a 18](sbe0253.htm)\n\n'
