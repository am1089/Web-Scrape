The teachers of Brahman (Veda) declare, as the Prata _h_ -savana (morning-\noblation) belongs to the Vasus, the Madhyandina-savana (noon-libation) to\n\np. 36\n\nthe Rudras, the third Savana (evening-libation) to the \xc3\x82dityas and the Vi _s_\nve Devas,\n\n2\\. Where then is the world of the sacrificer? He who does not know this, how\ncan he perform the sacrifice? He only who knows, should perform it 1.\n\n3\\. Before the beginning of the Prataranuvaka, (matin-chant), the sacrificer,\nsitting down behind the household altar (garhapatya), and looking towards the\nnorth, sings the Saman, addressed to the Vasus:\n\n4\\. 'Open the door of the world (the earth), let us see thee, that we may rule\n(on earth).'\n\n5\\. Then he sacrifices, saying: 'Adoration to Agni, who dwells on the earth,\nwho dwells in the world! Obtain that world for me, the sacrificer! That is the\nworld for the sacrificer!'\n\n6\\. 'I (the sacrificer) shall go thither, when this life is over. Take this!\n(he says, in offering the libation.) Cast back the bolt!' Having said this, he\nrises. For him the Vasus fulfil the morning-oblation.\n\n7\\. Before the beginning of the Madhyandina-savana, the noon-oblation, the\nsacrificer, sitting down behind the \xc3\x82gnidhriya altar, and looking towards the\nnorth, sings the Saman, addressed to the Rudras:\n\n8\\. 'Open the door of the world (the sky), let us see thee, that we may rule\nwide (in the sky).'\n\n9\\. Then he sacrifices, saying: 'Adoration to\n\np. 37\n\n[paragraph continues] Vayu (air), who dwells in the sky, who dwells in the\nworld. Obtain that world for me, the sacrificer! That is the world for the\nsacrificer!'\n\n10\\. 'I (the sacrificer) shall go thither, when this life is over. Take this!\nCast back the bolt!' Having said this, he rises. For him the Rudras fulfil the\nnoon-oblation.\n\n11\\. Before the beginning of the third oblation, the sacrificer, sitting down\nbehind the \xc3\x82havaniya altar, and looking towards the north, sings the Saman,\naddressed to the \xc3\x82dityas and Vi _s_ ve Devas:\n\n12\\. 'Open the door of the world (the heaven), let us see thee, that we may\nrule supreme (in heaven).' This is addressed to the \xc3\x82dityas.\n\n13\\. Next the Saman addressed to the Vi _s_ ve Devas: 'Open the door of the\nworld (heaven), let us see thee, that we may rule supreme (in heaven).'\n\n14\\. Then he sacrifices, saying: 'Adoration to the \xc3\x82dityas and to the Vi _s_\nve Devas, who dwell in heaven, who dwell in the world. Obtain that world for\nme, the sacrificer!'\n\n15\\. 'That is the world for the sacrificer! I (the sacrificer) shall go\nthither, when this life is over. Take this! Cast back the bolt!' Having said\nthis, he rises.\n\n16\\. For him the \xc3\x82dityas and the Vi _s_ ve Devas fulfil the third oblation. He\nwho knows this, knows the full measure of the sacrifice, yea, he knows it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[36:1](sbe01058.htm#fr_158) The commentator is always very anxious to explain\nthat though it is better that a priest should know the hidden meaning of the\nsacrificial acts which he has to perform, yet there is nothing to prevent a\npriest, who has not yet arrived at this stage of knowledge, from performing\nhis duties.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1](sbe01059.htm)\n\n"
