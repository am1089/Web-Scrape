Charm to repel sorceries or spells.\n\n1\\. The (spell) which they skilfully prepare, as a bride for the wedding, the\nmultiform (spell), fashioned by hand, shall go to a distance: we drive it\naway!  \n2\\. The (spell) that has been brought forward by the fashioner of the spell,\nthat is endowed with head, endowed with nose, endowed with ears, and\nmultiform, shall go to a distance: we drive it away!  \n3\\. (The spell) that has been prepared by a Sadra, prepared by a Raga,\nprepared by a woman, prepared by Brahmans, as a wife rejected by her husband,\nshall recoil upon her fabricator, (and) his kin!  \n4\\. With this herb have I destroyed all spells, that which they have put into\nthy field, into thy cattle, and into thy men.  \n5\\. Evil be to him that prepares evil, the curse shall recoil upon him that\nutters curses: back do we hurl it against him, that it may slay him that\nfashions the spell.  \n6\\. Pratikina (' Back-hurler'), the descendant of Angiras, is our overseer and\nofficiator (purohita): do thou drive back again (pratikih) the spells, and\nslay yonder fashioners of the spells!  \n7\\. He that has said to thee (the spell): 'go on'! upon that enemy, that\nantagonist do thou turn, O spell: do not seek out us, that are harmless!  \n8\\. He that has fitted together thy joints with skill, as the wagoner (Ribhu)\nthe joints of a chariot, to him go, there is thy course: this person here\nshall remain unknown to thee!  \n9\\. They that have prepared thee and taken hold of thee, the cunning wizards-\nthis is what cures it, destroys the spell, drives it back the opposite way -\nwith it do we bathe thee.  \n10\\. Since we have come upon the wretched (spell), as upon (a cow) with a dead\ncalf, flooded away (by a river), may all evil go away from me, and mav\npossessions come to me!  \n11\\. If (thy enemies) have made (offerings) to thy Fathers, or have called thy\nname at the sacrifice, may these herbs free thee from every indigenous evil!  \n12\\. From the sin of the gods, and that of the fathers, from mentions of (thy)\nname, from (evil schemes) concocted at home, may the herbs free thee with\nmight, through (this) charm, (and these) stanzas, (that are) the milk of the\nRishis!  \n13\\. As the wind stirs up the dust from the earth, and the cloud from the\natmosphere, thus may all misfortune, driven by my charm, go away from me!  \n14\\. Stride away (O spell), like a loudly braying she-ass, that has been\nloosened (from the tether); reach those that have fabricated thee, driven from\nhere by (my) forceful charm!  \n15\\. 'This is the way, O spell,' with these words do we lead thee. Thee that\nhast been sent Out against us do we send back again. Go this way like a\ncrushing army, with heavy carts, thou that art multiform, and crowned by a\ncrest(?)!  \n16\\. In the distance there is light for thee, hitherward there is no road for\nthee; away from us take thy course! By another road cross thou ninety\nnavigable streams, hard to cross! Do not injure, go away!  \n17\\. As the wind the trees, crush down and fell (the enemy), leave them\nneither cow, nor horse, nor serving-man! Turn from here upon those that have\nfabricated thee, O spell, awaken them to childlessness!  \n18\\. The spell or the magic which they have buried against thee in the\nsacrificial straw (barhis), in the field, (or) in the burial-ground, or if\nwith superior skill they have practised sorcery against thee, that art simple\nand innocent, in thy household fire,--  \n19\\. The hostile, insidious instrument which they have brought hither has been\ndiscovered; that which has been dug in we have detected. It shall go whence it\nhas been brought hither; there, like a horse, it shall disport itself, and\nslay the offspring of him that has fashion'ed the spell!  \n20\\. Swords of good brass are in our house: we know how many joints thou hast,\nO spell! Be sure to rise, go away from hence! O stranger, what seekest thou\nhere?  \n21\\. I shall hew off, O spell, thy neck, and thy feet: run away! May Indra and\nAgni, to whom belong the children (of men), protect us!  \n22\\. King Soma, who guards and pities us, and the lords of the beings shall\ntake pity on us!  \n23\\. May Bhava and Sarva cast the lightning, the divine missile, upon him that\nperforms evil, fashions a spell, and does wrong!  \n24\\. If thou art come two-footed, (or) four-footed, prepared by the fashioner\nof the spell, multiform, do thou, having become eight-footed, again go away\nfrom here, O misfortune!  \n25\\. Anointed, ornamented, and well equipped, go away, carrying every\nmisfortune! Know, O spell, thy maker, as a daughter her own father!  \n26\\. Go away, O spell, do not stand still, track (the enemy) as a wounded\n(animal)! He is the game, thou the hunter: he is not able to put thee down.  \n27\\. Him that first hurls (the arrow), the other, laying on in defence, slays\nwith the arrow, and while the first deals the blow, the other returns the\nblow.  \n28\\. Hear, verily, this speech of mine, and then return whence thou camest,\nagainst the one that fashioned thee!  \n29\\. Slaughter of an innocent is heinous, O spell: do not slay our cow, horse,\nor serving-man! Wherever thou hast been put down, thence thee do we remove. Be\nlighter than a leaf!  \n30\\. If ye are enveloped in darkness, covered as if by a net--we tear all\nspells out from here, send them back again to him that fashioned them.  \n31\\. The offspring of them that fashion the spell, practise magic, or plot\nagainst us, crush thou, O spell, leave none of them! Slay those that fashion\nthe spell!  \n32\\. As the sun is released from darkness, abandons the night, and the streaks\nof the dawn, thus every misery, (every) device prepared by the fashioner of\nthe spell, (every) misfortune, do I leave behind, as an elephant the dust.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 31.
