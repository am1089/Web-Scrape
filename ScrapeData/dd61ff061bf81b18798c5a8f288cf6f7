"Our kingdom is lost to us," he said, "and our fortune; everything is\nlost; we depart in sorrow, and must live on fruits and roots and the produce\nof the chase. In the woods are many perils--many reptiles and hungry wild\nanimals seeking their prey."\n\nA Brahman advised the deposed rajah to call upon the sun god, and Yudhishthira\nprayed: "O sun, thou art the eye of the universe, the soul of all things that\nare; thou art the creator; thou art Indra, thou art Vishnu, thou art Brahma,\nthou art Prajapati, lord of creatures, father of gods and man; thou art fire,\nthou art Mind; thou art lord of all, the eternal Brahma."\n\nThen Surya 1 appeared before Yudhishthira and gave unto him a copper pot,\nwhich was ever filled with food for the brethren. 2\n\np. 250\n\nFor twelve long years the Pandavas lived in the woods with their wife\nDraupadi, and Dhaumya, the Brahman. Whatever food they obtained, they set\napart a portion for the holy men and ate the rest. They visited holy shrines;\nthey bathed in sacred waters; they performed their devotions. Ofttimes they\nheld converse with Brahmans and sages, who instructed them in pious works and\nblessed them, and also promised them that their lost kingdom would be restored\nin the fullness of time.\n\nThey wandered in sunshine and in shade; they dwelt in pleasant places, amidst\nabundant fruits and surrounded by flowers. They suffered also from tempests\nand heavy rains, when their path would be torn by streams, and Draupadi would\nswoon, and all the brethren would be faint and weary and in despair. Then\nBhima would carry them all on his back and under his arms.\n\nThe gods appeared unto the brethren during their exile. Dharma, god of wisdom\nand holiness, addressed Yudhishthira his son many questions, which he answered\npiously and well. Hanuman, son of Vayu, the wind god, was made manifest before\nBhima. It chanced that the strong Pandava, who was also Vayu\'s son, was\nhastening on his way and went swift as the wind; the earth shook under him and\ntrees fell down, and he killed at one touch of his foot tigers and lions and\neven great elephants that sought to obstruct his path. 1. Hanuman shrank to\nthe size of an ape, but his tail spread out in such great proportions across\nBhima\'s path, that he was compelled to stay his course and stand still. He\nspake to Bhima then and told the tale of Rama and Sita. Then he grew suddenly\nas lofty as Vindhya mountain and transported his brother, the\n\np. 251\n\n[paragraph continues] Pandava, to the garden of Kuvera, 1 King of Yakshas,\nlord of treasure, who dwells in Mount Kailasa in the Himalayas; then Bhima\nprocured sweet-scented flowers, which gave youth to those who had grown aged\nand turned grief into joy, and these he gave unto Draupadi.\n\nKrishna came to visit the Pandavas in the forest, and Draupadi lamented before\nhim, saying: "The evil-hearted Duryodhana dared to claim me for his slave.\nFie! fie! upon the Pandavas because that they looked on in silence when I was\nput to shame. Is it not the duty of a husband to protect his wife? . . . These\nhusbands of mine, who have the prowess of lions, saw me afflicted, nor lifted\na hand to save."\n\nDraupadi wept bitter tears from her exquisite coppery eyes, but Krishna at\nlength comforted her, saying: "Thou wilt yet live to see the wives of those\nmen who persecuted thee lamenting over their fallen husbands as they welter in\ntheir life blood. . . . I will help the Pandavas, and thou wilt be once again\na queen over kings."\n\nKrishna said to Yudhishthira: "Had I been at Dwaraka when thou wert called\nupon to visit Hastinapur, this unfair match would not have taken place, for I\nwould have warned Dhritarashtra. But I was waging a war against demons.\n\n. . What can I do, now that this disaster is accomplished? . . . It is not\neasy to confine the waters after the dam hath burst."\n\nAfter Krishna returned to his kingdom, Draupadi continued to lament her fate.\nShe said to Yudhishthira: "The sinful, evil-hearted Duryodhana hath a heart of\nsteel. . . . O king, I lie on the ground, remembering my soft luxurious bed.\nI, who sit on a grass mat, cannot forget my chairs of ivory. I have seen thee\nin the court of\n\np. 252\n\nmonarchs; now thou art a beggar. I have gazed upon thee in thy silken robes,\nwho art now clad in rags. . . . What peace can my heart know now, O king,\nremembering the things that have been? My heart is full of grief. . . . Doth\nnot thy wrath blaze up, seeing thy brothers in distress and me in sorrow? How\ncanst thou forgive thy cruel enemy? Art thou devoid of anger, Yudhishthira? .\n. . Alas! a Kshatriya who doth not act at the right moment--who forgiveth the\nfoeman he should strike down, is the most despised of all men. The hour hath\nnow come for thee to seek vengeance; the present is not a time for\nforgiveness."\n\nSaid the wise Yudhishthira: "Anger is sinful; it is the cause of destruction.\nHe that is angry cannot distinguish between right and wrong. Anger slayeth one\nwho should be reverenced; it doth reverence to one who should he slain. An\nangry man may commit his own soul to hell. Know thou that wise men control\ntheir wrath so as to achieve prosperity both in this world and in the next. A\nweak man cannot control his wrath; but men of wisdom and insight seek to\nsubdue their passions, knowing that he who is angry cannot perceive things in\ntheir true perspective. None but ignorant people regard anger as equivalent to\nenergy. . . . Because fools commit folly, should I who seek wisdom do\nlikewise? . . . If wrongs were not righted except by chastisement, the whole\nworld would speedily be destroyed, for anger is destruction; it maketh men to\nslay one another. O fair Draupadi! it is meet to be forgiving; one should\nforgive every wrong. He who is forgiving shall attain to eternal bliss; he who\nis foolish and cannot forgive is destroyed both in this world and in the next.\nForgiveness is the greatest virtue; it is sacrifice; it is tradition; it is\ninspiration. Forgiveness, O beautiful one! is holiness; it\n\np. 253\n\nis Truth; it is Brahma. By forgiveness the universe is made steadfast. . . .\nThe wise man who learns how to forgive attaineth to Brahma (the highest god).\nO Draupadi, remember thou the verses of the sage--\n\n\'Let not thy wrath possess thee,  \n  But worship peace with joy;  \nWho yieldeth to temptation  \n  That great god will destroy\'.\n\n[paragraph continues] He who is self-controlled will attain to sovereignty,\nand the qualities of self-control are forgiveness and gentleness. O let me\nattain with self-control to everlasting goodness!"\n\nSaid Draupadi: "I bow down before the Creator and Ordainer of life and the\nthree worlds, for my mind, it seems, hath been dimmed. By deeds men are\ninfluenced, for deeds produce consequences; by works are they set free. . . .\nMan can never gain prosperity by forgiveness and gentleness; thy virtue hath\nnot shielded thee, O king; thou art following a shadow. . . . Men should not\nobey their own wills, but the will of the god who hath ordained all things. .\n. . Yet O, methinks, as a doll is moved by strings, so are living creatures\nmoved by the lord of all; he doth play with them as a child with a toy. . . .\nThose who have done wrong are now happy, and I am full of grief and in sore\ndistress. Can I praise thy god who permits of such inequality? What reward\ndoth thy god receive when he alloweth Duryodhana to prosper--he who is full of\nevil; he who doth destroy virtue and religion? If a sin doth not rebound on\nthe sinner, then a man\'s might is the greatest force and not thy god, and I\nsorrow for those who are devoid of might."\n\nYudhishthira made answer: "Alas! thy words are the words of an unbeliever. I\ndo not act merely for the sake of reward. I give because it is right to give,\nand\n\np. 254\n\n[paragraph continues] I sacrifice because it is my duty so to do. I follow in\nthe paths of those who have lived wise and holy lives, because that my heart\nturneth toward goodness. I am no trader in goodness, ever looking for the\nfruits thereof. The man who doubteth virtue will be born among the brutes; 1\nhe will never attain to everlasting bliss. O do not, thou fair one, doubt the\nancient religion of thy people! God will reward; he is the giver of fruits for\ndeeds; virtue and vice bear fruits. . . . The wise are content with little in\nthis world; the fools are not content although they receive much, because they\nwill have no joy hereafter. . . . The gods are shrouded in mystery; who can\npierce the cloud which covers the doings of the gods? Although thou canst not\nperceive the fruits of goodness, do not doubt thy religion or the gods. Let\nthy scepticism give room to faith. O do not slander the great god, but\nendeavour to learn how to know him. Turn not away from the Supreme One who\ngiveth eternal life, O Draupadi."\n\nSaid Draupadi: "I do not slander my god, the lord of all, for in my sorrow I\nbut rave. . . . But yet I hold that a man should act, lest by inaction he is\ncensured. Without acts no one can live. He who believeth in chance and destiny\nand is inactive, liveth a life of weakness and helplessness which cannot last\nlong. Success comes to him who acts, and success depends on time and\ncircumstance. So hath a wise Brahman taught me."\n\nBhima then spoke, charging Yudhishthira with weakness, and pleading with him\nto wrest the sovereignty from Duryodhana: "O thou art like froth," he cried;\n"thou art unripe fruit! O king, strike down thine enemies! Battle is the\nhighest virtue for a Kshatriya."\n\np. 255\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Verily, my heart burneth because of our sufferings. But I\nhave given my pledge to remain in exile, and it cannot be violated, O Bhima.\nVirtue is greater than life and prosperity in this world; it is the way to\ncelestial bliss."\n\nThen they were all silent, and they pondered over these things.\n\nNow the Pandavas had need of celestial weapons, for these were possessed by\nDrona and Bhishma and Karna. In time, therefore, the holy sage Vyasa appeared\nbefore Arjuna and bade him to visit Mount Kailasa, the high seat of the\ngracious and propitious god Shiva, the three-eyed, the blue-throated, and to\nperform penances there with deep devotion, so as to obtain gifts of arms. So\nArjuna went his way, and when he reached the mountain of Shiva he went through\ngreat austerities: he raised his arms aloft and, leaning on naught, stood on\nhis tiptoes; for food he ate at first withered leaves, then he fed upon air\nalone. Great was the fervour of his austerities, and from the ground smoke\nissued forth. The Rishis pleaded with Shiva, fearing disaster from the\npenances of Arjuna. Then the god assumed the form of a hunter and went towards\nIndra\'s warrior son, whom he challenged to single combat. First they fought\nwith weapons; then they wrestled one with another fiercely and long, and in\nthe end Arjuna was cast upon the ground and he swooned. When that brave\nPandava regained consciousness he made a clay image of Shiva, prostrated\nhimself and worshipped the gracious one, and made an offering of flowers. Soon\nafterwards he beheld his opponent wearing the garland he had given, and he\nknew that he had wrestled with Shiva himself. Arjuna fell down before him, and\nreceived from the god a celestial weapon named Pasupata. Then a great storm\nbroke forth, and\n\np. 256\n\nthe earth shook, and the spirit of the weapon stood beside Arjuna, ready to\nobey his will.\n\nNext appeared Indra, king of gods, Varuna, god of waters, Yama, king of the\ndead, and Kuvera, lord of treasures, and they stood upon the mountain summit\nin all their glory; unto Arjuna they gave gifts of other celestial weapons.\n\nThereafter Indra transported his son to his own bright city, the celestial\nSwarga, where the flowers always bloom and sweet music is ever wafted on\nfragrant winds. There he beheld sea-born Apsaras, the heavenly brides of gods\nand heroes, and music-loving Gandharvas, who sang songs and danced merrily in\ntheir joy. And Urvasi, a fair Apsara of faultless form, with bright eyes and\nsilken hair, looked with love upon Arjuna; but she sought in vain to subdue\nhim, whereat she spoke scornfully, saying: "Kama, god of love, hath wounded me\nwith his arrows, yet thou dost scorn me. For this, O Arjuna, thou wilt for a\nseason live unregarded among women as a dancer and musician."\n\nArjuna was troubled, but Indra said: "This curse will work out for thy good."\n\nArjuna abode in Indra\'s fair city for the space of five years. He achieved\ngreat skill in music and in dance and song. And he was trained also to wield\nthe celestial weapons which the gods had given unto him.\n\nNow the demons and giants who are named the Daityas and Danavas were the\nancient enemies of Indra. Certain of them there were who had their dwellings\nin the lowest division of the underworld beneath the floor of ocean, which is\ncalled Patala. And a day came when Arjuna waged war with them. He rode forth\nin Indra\'s great car, which went through the air like to a bird, and Matali\nwas the driver. When he reached the shore of\n\np. 257\n\nthe sounding sea, the billows rose against him like great mountains, and the\nwaters were divided; he saw demon fish and giant tortoises, and vessels laden\nwith rubies. But he paused not, for he was without fear. The mighty Arjuna was\neager for battle, and he blew a mighty blast upon his war shell: the Daityas\nand Danavas heard him and quaked with terror. 1 Then the demons smote their\ndrums and sounded their trumpets, and amidst the dread clamour the wallowing\nsea monsters arose and leapt over the waves against Indra\'s great son. But\nArjuna chanted mantras; he shot clouds of bright arrows; he fought with his\nbright celestial weapons, and the furies were thwarted and beaten back. Then\nthey sent fire against him and water, and they flung rocks like to great\npeaks; but he fought on until in the end he triumphed, and slew all that stood\nagainst him nor could escape.\n\nThereafter the valiant hero rode speedily towards the city of demons and\ngiants which is named Hiranyapura. The women came out to lure him, calling\naloud, and their voices were like the voices of cranes. He heard but paused\nnot. All these evil giant women were driven before him; in confusion they\nfled, terrified by the clamour of Indra\'s celestial car and the driving of\nMatali, and their ear-rings and their necklaces fell from their bodies like to\nboulders tumbling and thundering adown mountain steeps.\n\nArjuna reached the city of Hiranyapura and entered it; and he gazed with\nwonder on mighty chariots with ten thousand horses, which were many-coloured\nlike to gaily-plumaged peacocks, beautiful and stately and proud. And he\nwrecked the dwellings of the Daityas and Danavas.\n\np. 258\n\nIndra praised his warrior son for his valour in overcoming the demons and\ngiants of ocean, and he gave unto him a chain of gold, a bright diadem, and\nthe war shell which gave forth a mighty blast like to thunder. 1\n\nDuring the years that Arjuna had his dwelling in Indra\'s celestial city,\nYudhishthira and his three younger brethren, with Draupadi and the priest\nDhaumya, abode a time in the forest of Kamyaka. Great sages visited them\nthere, and from one Yudhishthira obtained skill in dice. Others led the\nwanderers to sacred waters, in which they were cleansed of their sins, and\nthey achieved great virtues. And the sages related unto them many tales of men\nand women who suffered and made self-sacrifices, undergoing long exiles and\nperforming penances so as to attain to great wisdom and win favour from the\ngods.\n\nThereafter the exiles went northward towards the Himalayas, and at length they\nbeheld afar off the dwelling of Kuvera, lord of treasure and King of Yakshas.\nThey gazed upon palaces of crystal and gold; the high walls were studded with\njewels, and the gleaming ramparts and turrets were adorned by dazzling\nstreamers. They saw beauteous gardens of bright flowers, and soft winds came\ntowards them laden with perfume; wonderful and fair were the trees, and they\nwere vocal with the songs of birds.\n\nKuvera walked forth and spake words of wisdom unto Yudhishthira, counselling\nhim to be patient and long-suffering, and to wait for the time and the place\nfor displaying Kshatriya prowess.\n\nThe exiles wandered on, and one day, when they sighed for Arjuna, they beheld\nthe bright car of Indra,\n\np. 259\n\nand they worshipped Matali, the charioteer. Then Indra came with his hosts of\nApsaras and Gandharvas, and when they had adored him, the god promised\nYudhishthira that he would yet reign in splendour over all men.\n\nArjuna appeared, and he was received with rejoicing, and all the Pandavas\nreturned together to Kamyaka. There they were visited by Markandeya, the\nmighty sage, whose life endures through all the world\'s ages, and he spake of\nthe mysteries and all that had taken place from the beginning, and revealed\nunto them full knowledge of the Deluge.\n\nNow while the Pandavas were enduring great suffering in the forest, Karna\nspake to Duryodhana and prevailed upon him to spy upon their misery. So\nDhritarashtra\'s son went forth, as was the custom every three years, to\ninspect the cattle and brand the calves. And with him went Karna and many\nprinces and courtiers, and also a thousand ladies of the royal household.\nWhen, however, they all drew nigh to the forest, they found that the\nGandharvas and Apsaras, who, as it chanced, had descended to make merry there,\nwould not permit the royal train to advance. Duryodhana sent messages to the\nGandharva king, commanding him to depart with all his hosts; but the celestial\nspirits feared him not, and issued forth to battle. A great conflict was\nwaged, and the Kauravas were defeated. Karna fled, and Duryodhana and many of\nhis courtiers and all the royal ladies were taken prisoners.\n\nIt happened that some of Duryodhana\'s followers who took flight reached the\nplace where the Pandavas were, and told them how their kinsmen had been\novercome. Then Arjuna and Bhima and the two younger brethren went forth\nagainst the Gandharvas and fought with them until they were compelled to\nrelease the royal\n\np. 260\n\nprisoners. In this manner was the proud Duryodhana humbled by those against\nwhom he had cherished enmity.\n\nYudhishthira gave a feast to the Kauravas, and he called Duryodhana his\n"brother", whereat Duryodhana made pretence to be well pleased, although his\nheart was stung with deep mortification.\n\nAfter this the sullen and angry Duryodhana resolved to end his life. His\nfriends remonstrated with him, but he said: "I have naught to live for now,\nnor do I desire friendship, or wealth, or power, or enjoyment. Do not delay my\npurpose, but leave me each one, for I will eat no more food, and I will wait\nhere until I die. Return, therefore, unto Hastinapur and reverence and obey\nthose who are greater than me."\n\nThen Duryodhana made a mat of grass, and, having purified himself with water,\nsat down to wait for the end, clad in rags and absorbed in silent meditation.\n\nBut the Daityas and Danavas 1 desired not that their favourite rajah should\nthus end his life lest their power should be weakened, and they sent to the\nforest a strange goddess, who carried him away in the night. Then the demons,\nbefore whom Duryodhana was brought, promised to aid him in the coming struggle\nagainst the Pandavas, and he was comforted thereat, and abandoned his vow to\ndie in solitude. So he returned speedily unto Hastinapur and resumed his high\nposition there.\n\nSoon afterwards, when the princes and the elders sat in council with the\nmaharajah, wise old Bhishma praised the Pandava princes for their valour and\ngenerosity, and advised Duryodhana to offer them his friendship, so that the\nkinsmen might ever afterwards live together in peace. Duryodhana made no\nanswer, and, smiling bitterly, rose up and walked out of the council chamber.\nBhishma\n\np. 261\n\nwas made angry thereat, and departed also and went unto his own house.\n\nThen Duryodhana sought to rival the glory of Yudhishthira by holding an\nImperial sacrifice. Duhsasana, with evil heart, sent messengers unto\nYudhishthira, inviting him to attend with his brethren; but Yudhishthira said:\n"Although this great sacrifice will reflect honour on all the descendants of\nKing Bharata, and therefore upon me and my brethren, I cannot be present\nbecause our years of exile have not yet come to an end."\n\nHe spoke calmly and with dignity, but Bhima was made angry, and exclaimed:\n"Messengers of Duryodhana, tell thy master that when the years of exile are\nover, Yudhishthira will offer up a mighty sacrifice with weapons and burn in\nconsuming flames the whole family of Dhritarashtra."\n\nDuryodhana received these messages in silence. And when the sacrifice, which\nwas called Vaishnava, was held, Karna said unto Duryodhana: "When thou has\nslain the Pandavas and canst hold thy Rajasuya 1, I will be present also to do\nhomage unto thee."\n\nThen Karna took a vow and said: "I will neither eat venison nor wash my feet 2\nuntil I have slain Arjuna."\n\nSpies hastened unto the Pandavas and related all that had taken place at the\nsacrifice, and also the words which Karna had spoken. When Yudhishthira heard\nof the terrible vow which Karna had vowed, he sorrowed greatly, for he knew\nthat a day must come when Arjuna and Karna would meet in deadly conflict.\n\nOne day thereafter Surya, god of the sun, warned\n\np. 262\n\n[paragraph continues] Karna that Indra had resolved to divest him of his\ncelestial armour and ear-rings. "But," said Surya, "thou canst demand in\nexchange a heavenly weapon which hath power to slay gods and demons and mortal\nmen."\n\nSo it came that Indra stood before Karna, disguised as a Brahman, and asked\nfor his armour and ear-rings. Having vowed to give unto the Brahmans\nwhatsoever they might ask of him, Karna took off his armour and ear-rings and\ngave them unto the king of the gods, from whom he demanded in exchange an\ninfallible weapon. Indra granted his request, but smiled 1and went upon his\nway, knowing well that the triumph of the Pandavas was now assured.\n\nIt chanced that one day after this that Jayadratha 2, Rajah of Sindhu, passed\nthrough the wood when the Pandavas had gone a-hunting. He beheld Draupadi with\neyes of love, and, despite her warnings, carried her away in his chariot.\n\nWhen the Pandavas returned and were told by a bondmaiden what had taken place,\nthey set out in pursuit of the Rajah of Sindhu, who left his chariot when they\ndrew nigh, and concealed himself in a thicket.\n\nBhima then said unto Yudhishthira: "Return now with Draupadi and our brethren.\nAlthough the rajah should seek refuge in the underworld, he will not escape my\nvengeance.\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Remember, O Bhima, that although Jayadratha hath committed\na grievous sin, he is our kinsman, for he hath married the sister of\nDuryodhana."\n\nDraupadi said: "He is worthy of death, for he is the\n\np. 263\n\nworst of kings and the vilest of men. Have not the sages said that he who\ncarries off the wife of another in times of peace must certainly be put to\ndeath."\n\nWhen Bhima found Jayadratha, he cast him down and cut off his hair except five\nlocks; then the strong warrior promised to spare the rajah\'s life if he would\ndo homage to Yudhishthira and declare himself his slave.\n\nSo the Rajah of Sindhu had to prostrate himself before Yudhishthira as a\nhumble menial. Thereafter he departed in his shame and went unto his own\ncountry.\n\nWhen the twelfth year of exile was nigh to an end, the Pandava brethren\nbethought them to leave the forest. But ere they went a strange and dread\nadventure threatened them with dire disaster. It chanced that a stag carried\naway upon its antlers the twigs with which a Brahman was wont to kindle his\nholy fire. The Brahman appealed to Yudhishthira to pursue the animal, and the\nPandavas endeavoured in vain to kill it or recover the sacred twigs. Weary\nwith the chase, they at length sat down to rest. They were all athirst, and\none of them climbed a banyan tree to look for signs of water, for birds ever\nflutter over pools. When it was discovered that a pond was nigh, Yudhishthira\nsent Nakula towards it. The young man approached the water, and ere he stooped\nhe heard a Voice which said: "Answer thou what I shall ask of thee ere thou\ndost drink or draw water."\n\nBut Nakula\'s thirst was greater than his fear, and he drank of the waters;\nthen he fell dead.\n\nSahadeva followed him, wondering why his brother tarried. He too gazed\ngreedily upon the pool, and he too heard the Voice, but heeded not and drank;\nand he fell dead also.\n\nArjuna next went towards the water. The Voice spake to him, and he answered\nwith anger: "Who art\n\np. 264\n\nthou that wouldst hinder me thus? Reveal thyself; and mine arrows will speak\nto thee."\n\nThen he drew his bow, and his shafts flew thick and fast as raindrops. But his\nvalour was as naught, for when he drank he also fell dead like the others.\nBhima followed him, and stooped and drank, unheeding the Voice, and he was\nstricken down like to Arjuna and Nakula and Sahadeva.\n\nAt length wise Yudhishthira approached the pond. He beheld his brethren lying\ndead, and sorrowed over them. Then, as he drew nigh to the water, the Voice\nspake once again, and he answered it, saying: "Who art thou?"\n\nThe Voice said: "I am a Yaksha. I warned thy brethren not to drink of this\nwater until they had answered what I should ask of them, but they disregarded\nmy warning and I laid them in death. If thou wilt answer my questions thou\ncanst, however, drink here nor be afraid."\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Speak and I will answer thee."\n\nThe Voice said: "Who maketh the sun to rise? Who keepeth him company? Who\nmaketh the sun to go down? In whom is the sun established?"\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Brahma maketh the sun to rise; the gods accompany him;\nDharma maketh the sun to set; in truth is the sun established."\n\nThe Voice said: "What sleepeth with open eyes? What moveth not after birth?\nWhat is that which hath no heart? What is that which swelleth of itself?"\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "A fish doth sleep with open eyes; an egg moveth not after\nbirth; a stone hath no heart; a river swelleth of itself."\n\nThe Voice said: "What maketh The Way? What\n\np. 265\n\nis called Water? What is called Food? What is called Poison?"\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "They that are pious make The Way; space is called water;\nthe cow is food 1; a request is poison."\n\nThe Voice said: "Who is spoken of as the unconquered enemy of man? What is\nspoken of as the enemy\'s disease? Who is regarded as holy? Who is regarded as\nunholy?"\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Man\'s unconquered enemy is anger, and his disease is\ncovetousness; he who seeketh after the good of all is holy; he who is\nselfishly cold is unholy."\n\nThe Voice said: "Who are worthy of eternal torment?"\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "He who sayeth unto the Brahman whom he hath asked to his\nhouse, I have naught to give; he who declareth the Vedas to be false; he who\nis rich and yet giveth naught to the poor."\n\nMany such questions did the Voice address to wise Yudhishthira, and he\nanswered each one patiently and with knowledge. Then the Yaksha revealed\nhimself in the form of Dharma, god of wisdom and justice, for behold! he was\nthe celestial sire of Yudhishthira. Unto his son he granted two boons; and\nYudhishthira desired that his brethren should be restored to life, and that\nthey should all have power to remain unrecognized by anyone in the three\nworlds for the space of a year.\n\nEre the Pandavas left the forest, Yudhishthira invoked the goddess Durga 2,\ngiver of boons, saying: "O slayer of\n\np. 266\n\nthe Buffalo Asura, thou art worshipped by the gods, for thou art the protector\nof the three worlds. Chief of all deities, protect thou and bless thou us.\nConfer victory upon us, and help us in our distress."\n\nThe goddess heard Yudhishthira, and confirmed the promise of Dharma that the\nPandava brethren and Draupadi would remain unrecognized during the thirteenth\nand last year of their exile.\n\nThen the wanderers concealed their weapons in a tree, and went together\ntowards the city of Virata 1 so that they might conceal themselves. According\nto the terms of banishment, they would have to spend a further twelve years in\nthe jungle if the Kauravas discovered their whereabouts.\n\nThe Pandavas found favour in the eyes of the rajah. Yudhishthira became his\ninstructor in the art of playing with dice, because he was wont to lose\nheavily. Bhima was made chief cook. Arjuna, attired as a eunuch, undertook to\nteach dancing and music to the ladies of the harem. Nakula was given care of\nhorses, and Sahadeva of kine. The queen was drawn towards Draupadi, who\noffered to become a bondwoman on condition that she should not have to wash\nthe feet of anyone, or eat food left over after meals; and on these terms she\nwas engaged. The queen feared that Draupadi\'s great beauty would attract\nlovers and cause dispeace; but the forlorn woman said that she was protected\nby five Gandharvas, and was without fear.\n\nBhima soon won much renown by reason of his matchless strength. At a great\nfestival he overcame and slew a wrestler from a far country who was named\nJimuta, and he received many gifts. The rajah took great pride in him, and was\nwont to take him to the\n\np. 267\n\napartments of the women, where he wrestled with caged tigers and lions and\nbears, slaying each one at desire with a single blow. Indeed, all the brothers\nwere well loved by the monarch because of their loyal services.\n\nIt chanced that the queen\'s brother, Kichaka 1, a mighty warrior and commander\nof the royal army, was smitten with love for beautiful Draupadi, and at length\nhe sought to carry her away. But one night Bhima waited for him when he came\nstealthily towards Draupadi, and after a long struggle the strong Pandava slew\nhim. Then Bhima broke all this prince\'s bones and rolled up his body into a\nball of flesh.\n\nGreat was the horror of Kichaka\'s kinsmen when they discovered what had\nhappened, and they said: "No man hath done this awful deed; the Gandharvas\nhave taken vengeance."\n\nIn their wrath they seized Draupadi, to burn her on the pyre with the body of\nKichaka; but Bhima disguised himself and went to her rescue, and he scattered\nher tormentors in flight, killing many with a great tree which he had\nuprooted.\n\nThe rajah was terror-stricken, and spake unto the queen, and the queen\nthereafterwards asked Draupadi to depart from Virata. But the wife of the\nPandavas begged to remain in the royal service yet a time; and she said that\nher Gandharva protectors would serve the rajah in his greatest hour of peril,\nwhich, she foretold, was already nigh to him. So the queen bore with her, and\nDraupadi tarried there.\n\nSoon afterwards the Rajah of Trigartis, hearing that mighty Kichaka was dead,\nplotted with the Kauravas at Indra-prastha to attack the city of Virata with\npurpose to capture the raj. Duryodhana agreed to aid him, so the\n\np. 268\n\n[paragraph continues] Rajah of Trigartis invaded the kingdom from the north,\nwhile the Kauravas marched against Virata from the south.\n\nIt came to pass that on the last day of the thirteenth year of the Pandavas\'\nexile the first raid took place from the north, and many cattle were carried\noff. Yudhishthira and Bhima, with Nakula and Sahadeva, offered to give their\nhelp when it became known that the Rajah of Virata had been captured by his\nenemies. The Pandavas went forth to rescue the monarch, and they routed the\nraiders and rescued their prisoner; they also seized upon the Rajah of\nTrigartis, and forced him to submit with humility to his rival ere he was\nallowed to return to his own city.\n\nMeanwhile the Kauravas had advanced from the south. Uttar 1, son of the Rajah\nof Virata, went against them, and Arjuna was his charioteer. When the young\nman, however, beheld his enemies, he desired to flee, but his driver compelled\nhim by force to remain in the chariot.\n\nThen Arjuna procured his own weapons from the tree in which they were\nconcealed. Thus, fully armed, he rode against the Kauravas, who said: "If this\nbe Arjuna, he and his brethren must go into exile for another twelve years."\n\nBhishma said: "The thirteenth year of concealment is now ended."\n\nThe Kauravas, however, persisted that Arjuna had appeared ere the full time\nwas spent.\n\nIndra\'s great son advanced boldly. Suddenly he blew his celestial war shell,\nand all the Kauravas were stricken with fear, and they swooned and lay on the\nfield like men who slept. Arjuna forbore to slay them, and he commanded Uttar\nto take possession of their royal attire.\n\np. 269\n\n[paragraph continues] Then the great archer of the Pandavas returned to the\ncity with the rajah\'s son.\n\nNow when the monarch discovered how Arjuna had served him by warding off the\nattack of the Kauravas, he offered the brave Pandava his daughter, Uttara, for\na bride; but Arjuna said: "Let her be given unto my son."\n\nIt was then that the Pandava brethren revealed unto the Rajah of Virata who\nthey were. All those who had assembled in the palace rejoiced greatly and\nhonoured them.\n\nTo the marriage of Abhimamju, son of Arjuna and Subhadra, came many great\nrajahs. Krishna came with his brother Balarama, and the Rajah Drupada came\nwith his son Dhrishta-dyumna.\n\nNow the Rajah of Virata resolved to aid Yudhishthira in obtaining back his\nkingdom from the Kauravas, who protested that their kinsmen had been\ndiscovered ere yet the complete term of exile was ended.\n\nShakuni, the cunning gambler, and the vengeful Karna supported the proud and\nevil-hearted Duryodhana in refusing to make peace with the Pandava brethren,\ndespite the warnings of the sages who sat around the Maharajah Dhritarashtra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[249:1](iml21.htm#fr_263) The sun god.\n\n[249:2](iml21.htm#fr_264) Like the "Pot of Worth" possessed by the Celtic\nFinn-mac-Cool.\n\n[250:1](iml21.htm#fr_265) Like the Celtic giant Caoilte, who went swifter than\nthe March wind, and the Teutonic storm-giant Ecke, who gave chase to Dietrich\nin his character as Thunor (Thor).--See _Teutonic Myth and Legend_ , Chapter\nxxxviii.\n\n[251:1](iml21.htm#fr_266) Like the Teutonic elf-king Laurin, whose wonderful\nrose garden is among the Tyrolese mountains.-- _Teutonic Myth and Legend_.\n\n[254:1](iml21.htm#fr_267) In the next life in this world, according to the\nbelief in transmigration of souls.\n\n[257:1](iml21.htm#fr_268) Like Dietrich von Bern, he assumes the character of\nthe thunder god, and reminds us of Thor going eastward to battle against the\nJotuns.\n\n[258:1](iml21.htm#fr_269) For slaying a sea giant, the Celtic Finn-mac-Cool\nwas awarded by the king of Erin the "Horn of Worth", which could be heard\n"over seven hills".
