May the gods rich in light, unanimously longing for our\nsacrifice, hear us.\n\n2\\. Agni, threefold is thy strength; three are thy abodes; three are thy many\ntongues, O thou who art born in _Ri_ ta! And three, O Agni, are thy bodies\nbeloved by the gods. With these protect our prayers unremittingly.\n\n3 [1](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:3:1). Agni! Many are the names, O _G_ atavedas, of\nthee the immortal one, O self-dependent god! And whatever the secret powers of\nthe powerful [2](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:3:2) are, thou all-enlivener, in thee\nthey have placed together (those) many (powers), O (god) after whose relations\nmen ask [3](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:3:3).\n\n4\\. Agni is the divine leader of the divine tribes like Bhaga, the guardian of\nthe seasons [1](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:4:1), the righteous. May He, the killer\nof V _ri_ tra [2](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:4:2), the ancient one, the possessor of\nall wealth, bring the singer across all troubles.\n\n5\\.
