D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n\xc2\xa7 7\\. \xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81, Self or Spirit.--The word _\xc4\x81 tm\xc4\x81_ is several times used in the\n\xe1\xb9\x9aig-veda with the meaning of "breath," "spirit," in the literal sense; and so\nfar there was little to distinguish it from the word _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a_ (\xc2\xa7 5). But from\nthis\n\np. 18\n\nsense was further evolved the meaning "self." Then we can imagine that men\nbegan to reflect upon their own words. What, they doubtless asked, is the\n"self" of which we speak when we use sentences like "he finds it out by\n[him]self," "he goes by [him]self," "he sees [him]self"? It must be the inmost\nessence, the indwelling reality, the \xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb9 of each agent, the informing \xce\xb5\xe1\xbc\xb6\xce\xb4\xce\xbf\xcf\x82\nof subjecthood. Therefore it must be thought itself. For subjecthood is a mode\nof thought; and to thought or will all action is finally traceable. And the _\xc4\x80\ntm\xc4\x81_, the Self, the consciousness of self-identity on which is based all\nfurther ideation of the thinking subject, is one with _Brahma,_ the universal\nPower. My Idea is the World-Idea; "I am Brahma."\n\nThere is another link in this chain. The Vedic poets speak now and then of a\ngod _Daksha_ , who, as his name implies, is simply the abstract idea of\n"skill" or "intelligence" rather vaguely personified; and twice (x. v. 7,\nlxxii. 4, 5) Daksha is regarded as primal Being and universal father, from\nwhom sprang the great gods and the universe. Thus Vedic mythology furnished\ntwo fruitful ideas--that the objective universe sprang from Intelligence,\n_Daksha,_ and from an ideal Man, _Purusha;_ and hence grew up gradually the\nidealistic conception of the universe as arising from, and existing in, the\nThought of man.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Upanishadic Principals](brk11.htm)\n\n'
