On account of the majority of indicatory marks (the fire-altars built of\nmind, &c. do not form elements of any act); for this (i.e. the indicatory\n\np. 260\n\nmark) is stronger (than the general subject-matter); this also (has been\nexplained in the Pu. Mi. Sutras).\n\nIn the Agnirahasya of the Va _g_ asaneyins, in the Brahma _n_ a beginning 'for\nin the beginning indeed this was not existent,' we read with reference to mind\n(manas),' It saw thirty-six thousand shining fire-altars, belonging to itself,\nmade of mind, built of mind.' And, further on, the text makes similar\nstatements about other fanciful fire-altars built of speech, built of breath,\nbuilt of sight, built of hearing, built of work, built of fire.--A doubt here\narises whether these fire-altars built of mind and so on are connected with\nthe act (i.e. the construction of the fire-altar made of bricks), arid\nsupplementary to it, or whether they are independent, constituting a mere\nvidya.\n\nAgainst the prima facie view that those agnis are connected with the\nsacrificial act under whose heading the text records them, the Sutra maintains\ntheir independence, 'on account of the majority of indicatory marks.' For we\nmeet in that Brahma _n_ a with a number of indicatory marks confirming that\nthose agnis constitute a mere vidya; cp, e.g. the following passages:\n'Whatever these beings conceive in their minds, that is a means for those\nfire-altars,' and 'All beings always pile up those fire-altars for him who\nthus knows, even when he sleeps,' and so on 1.--And that indicatory marks\n(li\xe1\xb9\x85ga) are of greater force than the leading subject-matter (prakara _n_ a)\nhas been explained in the Purva Mima _m_ sa (III, 3, 14).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[260:1](sbe38187.htm#fr_165) For something which forms part of an act cannot\nbe brought about by something so indefinite as 'whatever these beings conceive\nin their minds,' nor can it be accomplished indifferently at any time by any\nbeings.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 45](sbe38188.htm)\n\n"
