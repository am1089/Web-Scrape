OBTAINING RELAXATION THROUGH YOGA\n\nWhile the _asanas_ or postures which will be described later are a basic part\nof the practice of Yoga, we should continue our study of Raja Yoga, the non-\nphysical phases of this practice. Some readers may find they cannot follow the\nrigid discipline of a full Yogic life; others may be seeking an easier path to\nrelaxation, and may feel that they are less concerned with their physical than\ntheir mental states.\n\nBreath control is an essential first step in obtaining a state of relaxation.\nIf you can, assume the Padmasana or Lotus Pose (page [35](rwy06.htm#page_35))\nor place yourself in a comfortable sitting position. Taken directly from the\nancient Sanskrit texts, the _Hatha Yoga Pradipika_ of Swatmaram Swami,\npublished in 1893, provides a specific guide for relaxation through breathing\nexercises.\n\nThere are three Yogic terms which you should know: " _puraka_ " is the term\nfor inhalation; " _rechaka_ " for exhalation; " _kumbhaka_ " for retention of\nbreath. Yogic instructions are: the Yogi assuming the Lotus Pose should draw\nin the _prana_ (breath) through the _ida_ (left nostril), and, having retained\nit as long as he can, exhale it through the _pingala_ (right nostril). Again,\ninhaling through the right nostril, he\n\np. 24\n\nshould hold his breath as long as possible and exhale slowly through the left\nnostril. He should inhale through the same nostril by which he exhaled and\nhaving restrained the breath to the utmost (until he is covered with\nperspiration, or until his body shakes) he should then exhale slowly, as\nexhaling forcefully would diminish the energy of the body.\n\nThese exercises should be performed four times a day\xc2\x97in the early morning, at\nmidday, evening and midnight\xc2\x97slowly increasing the number from three, each\ntime, to eighty. Their effects are described as "to render the mind and body\nslender and bright." Although in the direct translation from the Sanskrit, the\n_ida_ is named as being the left nostril and the _pingala_ as the right one,\nthese words more properly designate the two supposed conduits which connect\nwith the nostrils, and thence conduct throughout the entire body the vital air\n(the _prana_ ) that enters with the atmospheric air.\n\nBefore undertaking these exercises, persons of phlegmatic temperament are\ndirected to go through the following course of preparation: (1) Cleanse the\ngullet with a strip of cloth, the width of four fingers, by swallowing it and\nthen withdrawing it. Start gradually at the rate of one hand-span\'s length\ndaily; (2) Take daily enemas of water; (3) Cleanse the nostrils by putting up\na thread and drawing it out by way of the mouth; (4) Look without winking at a\nminute object with concentrated mind until the tears come; (5) With head bent\ndown, turn the viscera of the body to right and left; (6) Breathe in and out\nrapidly, like a bellows. Internal concentration, causing the stomach to empty\nitself by vomiting, is also recommended.\n\nAccording to the Hindu system of physiology, there are seventy-two thousand\n_nadis_ or channels leading from the throat to the _kundali_ in the pelvic\nregion. When these channels\n\np. 25\n\nhave been purified by proper breath control, the body is ready to absorb the\nfullest _prana_ from the atmosphere. Then, according to the old tracts, "the\nbody becomes lean, the speech eloquent, the inner sounds of the individual\'s\nbody are distinctly heard, the eyes are clear and bright, the body is freed\nfrom all disease, the seminal fluid is concentrated, the digestive fire is\nincreased and the _nadis_ are purified."\n\n#### Looking Inward for Relaxation\n\nIt is known that long and close concentration upon any given part of the body\nwill induce sensations there and, sometimes, even movement. Control over\nunused muscles may be obtained in this way. While it is a basic claim for\nHatha Yoga that the breathing exercises can lead to control over the mind by\nsupplying arterialized blood to the brain, and thus control mental by physical\naction, it is also claimed that strong, persistent concentration of the mind\nwill induce controlled breathing, thus directing physical action by mental.\n\nA story is told of a student whose teacher made him sit meditating in silence\nfor twelve years and at last commanded him to pronounce the sacred syllables\nA.U.M. This he did with the following results: "When the student came to the\nfirst syllable, _rechaka_ , or the process by which the air in the lungs is\npumped out, set in naturally. When he finished the second syllable, _puraka_ ,\nor the process of inhalation, set in. At the end of the third syllable,\n_kumbhaka_ , or the process of retention, set in, and in a short time he had\nsettled into the pure and elevated state of _samadhi_ , which may be defined\nas perfect relaxation."\n\np. 26\n\nThis story illustrates the largeness of the claim on behalf of Raja Yoga, or\nmental Yoga, that it brings physical Yoga with it, provided that the mental\nprocesses take the form of long-continued silent concentration. It also\nsupports the claim that what it brings is important, since the _pranayama_ of\nthe student soon brought him into perfect absorption.\n\n#### The Asanas\n\nThough many _asanas_ , or postures, are unsuited to people who habitually sit\nin chairs, those who practice Yoga often find themselves falling into these\nposes almost involuntarily. Many believe that the _asanas_ are natural\npositions of relaxation into which the body falls when freed from the controls\nof the conscious mind and from the postures into which they have been trained\nin our so-called "civilized living." William Flagg, one of the first\nWesterners to probe the secrets of Yoga, once stated: "A leg has jerked itself\nupwards and pressed the sole of its foot against the other as high up as\nseemed possible; this has happened hundreds of times." The posture here\nimitated is sitting on a foot, and its efficacy is supposed to lie in the\npressure upon the nerve centers in the foot, leg and region of the perineum.\n\nAnother _asana_ resembling the "plant balance" of modern gymnastics is\ndescribed thus: "Plant your hands firmly on the ground and support your body\non your elbows, pressing against the sides of your loins. Raise your feet in\nthe air stiff and straight on a level with the head." This position was\nattempted while the practitioner was seated in an easy chair, and failed to be\ncompleted only because the back of the chair kept the head from falling to the\nlevel of the feet. The legs were lifted from the floor and thrust out stiffly,\nwhile the weight of the body was made to rest on the elbows, which were\nresting on the arms of the chair. This was repeated not\n\np. 27\n\nonly once, but a great number of times. The elbows were pressed against the\nsides, forcefully and involuntarily hammering themselves violently and\nrepeatedly against the sides, giving excellent massage to both liver and\nspleen.\n\nThe Shavasana, said to eliminate fatigue and induce calmness of mind, is\ndescribed as lying on one\'s back at full length like a corpse. Often, when\nlying on his side, the practitioner has been turned over on his back as though\nby a power foreign to him, though apparently using his own muscles. This\nresulted in a curious sensation, which reproduced on the feet, ankles and seat\nof the body the compression which is obtainable by sitting on the feet,\nEastern fashion. It was as if a foreign body were pressed against the person\'s\nsides with a force equal to what would be felt in the postures of Hatha Yoga.\nSometimes several of the parts in question were acted upon simultaneously.\n\nAnother incident of a similar nature is described by Flagg in the practice of\nthe _mudras_ , or acts for putting the body in good condition. The Nauli Mudra\nis described: "With the head bent down, one should turn right and left the\nintestines of the stomach with the slow motion of a small eddy in the river."\nSomething like this interior movement is produced by one process of the\nSwedish movement-cure. It consists of sitting on a stool, bending the body\nforward as far as possible and rotating the trunk of the body like the spoke\nof a horizontal wheel. The head represents the tire and the seat, the hub. It\nwas just this movement that, in the case of two persons observed, was set up\nas often as kumbhaka, or the suspension of the breath, was practiced, neither\nof them having an idea of such a result. The Nauli Mudra is considered one of\nthe most important of all Hatha exercises, and the body rotation is one of the\nmost effective of the Swedish exercises.\n\np. 28\n\n#### Concentration\n\nA Yoga technique for concentration is expressed as "looking fixedly at the\nspot between the eyebrows." Many have reported that while cleansing the mind\nof thought, the eyeballs would of themselves roll upward as far as they could\ngo, and hold themselves there.\n\nThe Shambhavi Mudra provides almost complete relaxation by dividing the\nconscious concentration. It consists of fixing the mind on some part of the\nbody and the eyes rigidly and unwinkingly on an external object. Often while\nyou are concentrating intently with your eyes closed, they will seem to open\nalmost of themselves and fix on some object within range, always rigidly and\nwithout winking.\n\nAnother direction for the Yogi says: "Direct the pupils of the eyes toward the\nlight by raising the eyebrows a little upward." Often while trying this, your\neyebrows will raise themselves as if to get out of the way of the eyes. In the\nmotions noted here and in others, it seems as though an intelligent power\nbeyond conscious reach takes the Yoga adherent out of his own hands. This\npower appears to assume control of voluntary and involuntary muscles, working\nthem independently of the person\'s will, though, it should be noted, never\nagainst it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5.
