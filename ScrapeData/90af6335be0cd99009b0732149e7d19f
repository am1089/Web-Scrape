No place is described of which\nthe sacredness has any known limit, nor any work cited of probable\n\np. lxxii\n\nrecent composition. The Vedas, the Puran\xcc\x81as, other works forming the body of\nSanscrit literature, are named; and so is the Mahabharata, to which therefore\nit is subsequent. Both Bauddhas and Jains are adverted to. It was therefore\nwritten before the former had disappeared; but they existed in some parts of\nIndia as late as the twelfth century at least; and it is probable that the\nPuran\xcc\x81a was compiled before that period. The Gupta kings reigned in the\nseventh century; the historical record of the Puran\xcc\x81a which mentions them was\ntherefore later: and there seems little doubt that the same alludes to the\nfirst incursions of the Mohammedans, which took place in the eighth century;\nwhich brings it still lower. In describing the latter dynasties, some, if not\nall, of which were no doubt contemporary, they are described as reigning\naltogether one thousand seven hundred and ninety-six years. Why this duration\nshould have been chosen does not appear, unless, in conjunction with the\nnumber of years which are said to have elapsed between the great war and the\nlast of the Andhra dynasty, which preceded these different races, and which\namounted to two thousand three hundred and fifty, the compiler was influenced\nby the actual date at which he wrote. The aggregate of the two periods would\nbe the Kali year 4146, equivalent to A. D. 1045. There are some variety and\nindistinctness in the enumeration of the periods which compose this total, but\nthe date which results from it is not unlikely to be an approximation to that\nof the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\nIt is the boast of inductive philosophy, that it draws its conclusions from\nthe careful observation and accumulation of facts; and it is equally the\nbusiness of all philosophical research to determine its facts before it\nventures upon speculation. This procedure has not been observed in the\ninvestigation of the mythology and traditions of the Hindus. Impatience to\ngeneralize has availed itself greedily of whatever promised to afford\nmaterials for generalization; and the most erroneous views have been\nconfidently advocated, because the guides to which their authors trusted were\nignorant or insufficient. The information gleaned by Sir Wm. Jones was\ngathered in an early season of Sanscrit study, before the field was\ncultivated. The same may be said of the writings of\n\np. lxxiii\n\n[paragraph continues] Paulinus a St. Barolomaeo 96, with the further\ndisadvantage of his having been imperfectly acquainted with the Sanscrit\nlanguage and literature, and his veiling his deficiencies under loftiness of\npretension and a prodigal display of misapplied erudition. The documents to\nwhich Wilford 97 trusted proved to be in great part fabrications, and where\ngenuine, were mixed up with so much loose and unauthenticated matter, and so\noverwhelmed with extravagance of speculation, that his citations need to be\ncarefully and skilfully sifted, before they can be serviceably employed. The\ndescriptions of Ward 98 are too deeply tinctured by his prejudices to be\nimplicitly confided in; and they are also derived in a great measure from the\noral or written communications of Bengali pandits, who are not in general very\ndeeply read in the authorities of their mythology. The accounts of Polier 99\nwere in like manner collected from questionable sources, and his Mythologie\ndes Hindous presents a heterogeneous mixture of popular and Pauran\xcc\x81ik tales,\nof ancient traditions, and legends apparently invented for the occasion, which\nrenders the publication worse than useless, except in the hands of those who\ncan distinguish the pure metal from the alloy. Such are the authorities to\nwhich Maurice, Faber, and Creuzer have exclusively trusted in their\ndescription of the Hindu mythology, and it is no marvel that there should have\nbeen an utter confounding of good and bad in their selection of materials, and\nan inextricable mixture of truth and error in their conclusions. Their labours\naccordingly are far from entitled to that confidence which their learning and\nindustry would else have secured; and a sound and comprehensive survey of the\nHindu system is still wanting to the comparative analysis of the religious\nopinions of the ancient world, and to a satisfactory elucidation of an\nimportant chapter in the history of the human race. It is with the hope of\nsupplying some of the necessary means for the accomplishment of these objects,\nthat the following pages have been translated.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxxiii:96](vp031.htm#fr_94) Systema Brahmanicum, &c.\n\n[lxxiii:97](vp031.htm#fr_95) Asiatic Researches.\n\n[lxxiii:98](vp031.htm#fr_96) Account of the Hindus.\n\n[lxxiii:99](vp031.htm#fr_97) Mythologie des Hindous, edited by Canoness\nPolier.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Conclusion](vp032.htm)\n\n'
