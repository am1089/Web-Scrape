After one year (the teacher) recites the Savitri (to the student),\n\n2\\. (Or) after three nights,\n\n3\\. Or immediately.\n\n4 4-6. Let him recite a Gayatri to a Brahma _n_ a,\n\n5\\. A Trish _t_ ubh to a Kshatriya,\n\n6\\. A _G_ agati to a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n7\\. But let it be anyhow a verse sacred to Savitar.\n\n8\\. They seat themselves to the north of the fire,\n\n9 9. The teacher with his face turned eastward, the other westward.\n\np. 67\n\n10 10-11. After (the student) has said, 'Recite, sir!'\xc2\x97\n\n11\\. The teacher, having pronounced the word OM, then causes the other one to\nsay, 'Recite the Savitri, sir!'\n\n12\\. He then recites the Savitri to him, the verse 'That glorious (splendour)\nof Savitar' (Rig-Veda III, 62, 10); (firstly) pada by pada, (then) hemistich\nby hemistich, (and finally) without a stop.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[66:1](sbe29035.htm#fr_139) 5, 1. The study of the Veda is opened by the\nSavitri. Comp. _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a, loc. cit., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6 seq.\n\n[66:4-6](sbe29035.htm#fr_140) The Gayatri which the teacher shall recite to a\nBrahma _n_ a is the same verse of which it is said below, chap. q, II, that it\nbelongs to Vi _s_ vamitra (Rig-veda III, 62, to); the Trish _t_ ubh which is\ntaught to the Kshatriya is a verse ascribed to Hira _n_ yastupa, Rig-veda I,\n35, 2; the _G_ agati which is to be repeated to a Vai _s_ ya is Rig-veda IV,\n40, 5, belonging to Vamadeva, or Rig-veda I, 35, 9, belonging to Hira _n_\nyastupa. See the note on chap. 7, 10.\n\n[66:9](sbe29035.htm#fr_141) The same position is prescribed, in the same\nwords, for the study of the main part of the Veda, below, chap. 7, 3; during\np. 67 the study of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka the position is slightly different (VI, 3,\n2). According to Naraya _n_ a this Sutra would contain a nishedha of the\nSutras 828 and 829 of the Rig-veda-Prati _s_ akhya (p. ccxcii of Professor Max\nMuller's edition).\n\n[67:10-11](sbe29035.htm#fr_142) 10, 11. The Indian tradition divides these\nSutras after a _k_ arya _h_ , so that the words adhihi bho would have to be\npronounced by the teacher. Thus also Naraya _n_ a explains, a _k_ arya adhihi\nbho 3 iti ma _n_ avakam uktva, &c. In my opinion it is the student or the\nstudents who say adhihi bho. Thus the Prati _s_ akhya (Sutra 831, ed. Max\nMuller) says, 'They invite him with the words adhihi bho 3, all the students\nthe teacher, having embraced his feet.' Comp. also below, IV, 8, 12, the\ngreater part of which Sutra is word for word identical with these rules; VI,\n3, 6; Gautama I, 46; Gobhila II, 10, 38.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 6](sbe29036.htm)\n\n"
