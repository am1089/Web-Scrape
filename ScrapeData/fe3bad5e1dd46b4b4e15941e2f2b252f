Rama! soft they cried.  \nThe gift he took, no word replied.  \nThen Bhrigu's son his silence broke  \nAnd thus to Rama Rama spoke:  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[85:1](ry074.htm#fr_254) This is another Rama, son of Jamadagni, called\nParas'urama, or Rama with the axe, from the weapon which he carried. He was\nwhile he lived the terror ot the Warrior caste, and his name recalls long and\nfierce struggles between the sacerdotal and military order in which tne latter\nsuffered severely at the hands of their implacable enemy.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXV.: The Parle.](ry075.htm)\n\n"
