One day the wives of the Kouruvus and Panduvus were sitting with\nthe wives of Shree Krishnu Chund Jee, and were celebrating the exploits and\ngood qualities of Krishnu; upon something being said in conversation, Dropudee\nsaid to Shree Rookmunee Jee, "Say, O beautiful Rookmunee! how didst thou\nobtain Shree Krishnu Chund Jee?" Shree Rookmunee replied, "Listen attentively,\nO Dropudee! how Krishnu carried his scheme into execution: my father\'s wish\nwas to give his daughter to Shree Krishnu Chund, and my brother had set his\nmind upon giving me to Raja Sissoopal, who came with a marriage procession to\ncelebrate the marriage; and I sent a brahmin and invited Shree Krishnu Chund\nJee. On the marriage day, as I returned home after having offered adoration to\nDevee, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee having carried me off from the midst of the\narmy of the demons, seated me on his chariot, and pursued his journey\nhomewards. Having afterwards received intelligence of this event, the whole\narmy of demons came and made a violent attack upon Huri, who easily slew and\nput them to flight, he then\n\np. 413\n\nset out for Dwarka, taking me with him. On our arrival there, Rajas Oogursen,\nSoorsen and Basoodeo Jee married me to Shree Krishnu Chund, according to the\nprescribed injunctions of the Vedas; and, having heard the news of the\nmarriage, my father gave me a most liberal dowry."\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit,--O\ngreat king! Dropudee Jee made enquiries, similar to that she had made from\nShree Rookmunee, from Sutbhama, Jamwutee, Kalindee, Bhudru, Sutya,\nMittrabinda, Luchmuna, and the sixteen thousand and eight hundred queens of\nShree Krishnu Chund, and each explained all the circumstances and the history\nof her marriage.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXXIV](psa85.htm)\n\n'
