The fire which (the sacrificer keeps) from the time of his marriage, is\ncalled the Aupasana (or sacred domestic fire)\n\n2\\. With this fire the sacred domestic ceremonies are performed.\n\n3. 3 On account of his worship devoted to this (fire the sacrificer) is considered as an \xc3\x82hitagni (i.e. as one who has set up the _S_ rauta fires), and on account of his fortnightly _K_ aru sacrifices (on the days of the new and full moon) as one who offers the sacrifices of the new and full moon (as prescribed in the _S_ rauta ritual); so (is it taught).\n\n4\\. If (the service at the domestic fire) has been interrupted for twelve\ndays, the sacrificer ought to set the fire up again.\n\n5\\. Or he should count all the sacrifices (that have been left out), and\nshould offer them.\n\n6\\. (The punaradhana or repeated setting up of the fire is performed in the\nfollowing way): in an enclosed space, having raised (the surface), sprinkled\nit (with water), strewn it with sand, and covered it with Udumbara or Plaksha\nbranches, he silently brings together the things belonging to (the sacrifice)\naccording as he is able to get them, produces fire by attrition out of a\nsacrificially pure piece of wood, or gets a common fire, places it in a big\nvessel, sets it in a blaze, and puts (fuel) on it with the words, 'Bhu _h_!\nBhuva _h_! Suva _h_! Om! Fixity!'\n\np. 202\n\n7\\. He then puts wood on the fire, performs (the rites) down to the Vyah _ri_\nti oblations, and offers two 'minda oblations' (i.e. oblations for making up\nfor defects) with (the two Mantras), 'If a defect (minda) has arisen in me,'\n(and), 'Agni has given me back my eye' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. III, 2, 5, 4).\n\n8\\. He offers three 'tantu oblations' with (the Mantras), 'Stretching the weft\n(tantu)' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. III, 4, 2, 2), 'Awake, Agni!' (IV, 7, 13, 5), 'The\nthirty-three threads of the weft' (I, 5, 10, 4).\n\n9\\. He offers four 'abhyavartin oblations' with (the Mantras), 'Agni who turns\nto us (abhyavartin)!' 'Agni A\xe1\xb9\x85giras!' 'Again with sap,' 'With wealth' (Taitt.\nSa _m_ h. IV. 2, 1, 2. 3).\n\n10. 10 Having made oblations with the single Vyah _ri_ tis and with (the three Vyah _ri_ tis together), and having made an oblation with the verse, 'Thou art quick, Agni, and free from imprecation. Verily (satyam) thou art quick. Held by us in our quick mind (manas), with thy quick (mind) thou carriest the offering (to the gods). Being quick bestow medicine on us! Svaha!'\xc2\x97this (last) oblation contains an allusion to the mind (manas), it refers to Pra _g_ apati, and alludes to the number seven (?),\xc2\x97he quickly repeats in his mind the da _s_ ahot _ri_ formula (Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_ y. III, 1, 1). Then he makes the sagraha oblation (?); (then follow the\n\np. 203\n\noblations), 'This, O Varu _n_ a' (&c.; see I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the\nSutra). Then he serves food to the Brahma _n_ as and causes them to say, 'An\nauspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' he then performs in the known way the\nsacrifice of a mess of cooked food to Agni.\n\n11\\. Here he gives an optional gift to his Guru: a pair of clothes, a milch\ncow, or a bull.\n\n12. 12 If he sets out on a journey, he makes the fire enter himself or the two kindling-sticks in the way that has been described (in the _S_ rauta-sutra).\n\n13\\. Or let him make it enter a piece of wood, in the same way as into the\nkindling-sticks.\n\n14\\. A piece of Khadira wood, or of Pala _s_ a, or of Udumbara, or of A _s_\nvattha wood\xc2\x97\n\n15\\. With one of these kinds of wood he fetches, where he turns in (on his\njourney), fire from the house of a _S_ rotriya, and puts the (piece of wood)\ninto which his fire has entered, on (that fire), with the two verses, 'He who\nhas received the oblations' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 6, 5, 3), and 'Awake!' (IV,\n7, 13, 5).\n\n16\\. The way in which he sacrifices has been explained (in the _S_ rauta-\nsutra).\n\n17\\. If one half-monthly sacrifice has been omitted, he should have a\nsacrifice to (Agni) Pathik _ri_ t performed over this (fire). If two (half-\nmonthly sacrifices), to (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara and Pathik _ri_ t. If more than\ntwo, (the fire) has to be set up again.\n\n18\\. If the fire is destroyed or lost, or if it is mixed with other fires, it\nhas to be set up again..\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[201:1](sbe30069.htm#fr_636) This chapter is left out in Mat _ri_ datta's\ncommentary; it seems to be a later addition. The division of the Sutras is my\nown.\n\n[201:3](sbe30069.htm#fr_637) 26, 3. For tasyaupasanena I think we should read\ntasyopasanena.\n\n[202:10](sbe30069.htm#fr_638) As to the Mantra, 'Thou art quick, &c.,' comp.\nabove, I, 1, 3, 5, and the note on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 9, 12. I cannot see why\nthe oblation made with this Mantra is called saptavati (alluding to the number\nseven); possibly we ought to read satyavati (containing the word satyam,\n'verily'). Can the words sagraha _m_ hutva mean, 'having performed the worship\nof the planets (graha) at his sacrifice'?\n\n[203:12](sbe30069.htm#fr_639) Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana V, 1, 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 8, 27](sbe30070.htm)\n\n"
