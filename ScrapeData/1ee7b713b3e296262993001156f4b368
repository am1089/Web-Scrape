After having swept the place around the (kitchen) fire, sprinkled it with\nwater all around,\n\n[9. The particle _k_ a indicates that fragrant oleander and the like is also\npermitted. (Nand.)\n\n13\\. See LI, 38.\n\n14\\. This prohibition refers to those species of five-toed animals, fish, and\nboars, whose flesh is not in general forbidden. (Nand.) See LI, 3, 6, 21.\n\nLXVII. 1-32. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. I, 2; Gobh. I, 4; Par. I, 12; II, 9; _S_ a _n_ kh. II,\n{footnote p. 212} 14; M. III, 84-94; Y. II, 103-108; \xc3\x82past.

This chapter treats of the Vaisvadeva sacrifice. (Nand.)]\n\np. 212\n\nstrewed (Ku _s_ a grass) all around, and sprinkled (the latter) with water all\naround, he must take out of all dishes the uppermost part and offer it:\n\n2\\. To Vasudeva, to Sa _n_ karsha _n_ a, to Pradyumna, to Aniruddha, to\nPurusha, to Satya, to A _k_ yuta, to Vasudeva.\n\n3\\. Afterwards (he must offer twelve burnt-oblations) to Agni, to Soma, to\nMitra, to Varuna, to Indra, to Indra and Agni united, to the Vi _s_ vedevas,\nto Pra _g_ apati, to Anumati, to Dhanvantari, to Vastoshpati, and to Agni\nSvish _t_ ak _ri_ t (the god of the fire who causes the proper performance of\nthe sacrifice).\n\n4\\. Then let him make a Bali-offering with that which has been left of the\ndishes.\n\n5\\. To (the serpent demons) Taksha and Upataksha,\n\n6\\. (Strewing the two Balis) on both sides of the fire, to the east of it (on\nthe north-eastern side first, and on the south-eastern side afterwards).\n\n[1. Nand. infers from a text of _S_ aunaka, that the particle atha points to\nthe recitation of the Purushasukta as an initiatory ceremony.\n\n2\\. Regarding this Sutra, see the Introduction. The oblations to be offered\nare eight in number, one for each invocation.\n\n3\\. Devapala, in his Commentary on the corresponding section of the Ka _th_\naka G _ri_ hya-sutra, states that the deities to whom burnt oblations are\noffered (Sutra 3) shall be invoked with the word svaha, 'hail!' and those for\nwhom Bali-offerings are strewed upon the ground, with the word nama _h_ ,\n'adoration.'\n\n6-8. These three Sutras have been translated in accordance {footnote p. 213}\nwith Devapala's readings and his remarks on them. Nand. wrongly refers the\nfour names mentioned in 7 to the four quarters of the globe. The Mantra quoted\nin 7 is found complete in the Ka _th_ aka, XL, 4, and, in a modified form, in\nthe Taitt. Samh. IV, 4, 5, 1.]\n\np. 213\n\n7\\. (Then let him offer other seven Balis) to all (the seven Ish _t_ akas or\ngoddesses of the bricks of the altar, also to the east of the fire, while\npronouncing the Mantras), 'Thy name is Amba; thy name is Dula; thy name is\nNitatni (Nitatnir); thy name is _K_ upu _n_ ika (and so on).'\n\n8\\. (He must offer four Balis with the Mantras), 'O Nandini; O Subhaga; O Suma\n_n_ gali; O Bhadra _n_ kari,' (placing the Balis) in the corners (beginning\nwith the south-eastern corner and proceeding) towards the south.\n\n9\\. (He must place two Balis), addressed to _S_ ri Hira _n_ yakesi and to the\ntrees, near the firm pillar[1].\n\n10\\. (He must place two Balis), addressed to Dharma and Adharma and to M _ri_\ntyu, near the door.\n\n11\\. (He must place one Bali), addressed to Varu _n_ a, in the water-jar.\n\n12\\. (With the words, 'Adoration be) to Vish _n_ u,' (he must place one Bali)\nin the mortar.\n\n13\\. (With the words, 'Adoration be) to the Maruts,' (he must place one Bali)\non the mill-stone.\n\n14\\. (In the apartment) on the roof (let him place two Balis) addressed to Vai\n_s_ rava _n_ a (Kubera) the king, and to all created beings.\n\n15\\. (With the words, 'Adoration be) to Indra and to Indra's ministers,' (he\nmust place two Balis). in the eastern part (of the house).\n\n[9. 1 'I. e. the pillar which supports the house.' (Nand.) It appears from an\nanalogous passage of the Manava G _ri_ hya-sutra, that a pillar in the middle\nof the house is meant.]\n\np. 214\n\n16\\. (With the words, 'Adoration be) to Yama and to Yama's ministers,' (he\nmust place two Balis) in the southern part..\n\n17\\. (With the words, 'Adoration be) to Varuna and to Varu _n_ a's ministers,'\n(he must place two Balis) in the western part.\n\n18\\. (With the words, 'Adoration be) to Soma and to Soma's ministers,' (let\nhim place two Balis) in the northern part.\n\n19\\. (With the words, 'Adoration be) to Brahman and to Brahman's ministers,'\n(let him place two Balis) in the centre (of the house).\n\n20\\. (Let him throw) in the air (a Bali) addressed to \xc3\x82ka _s_ a (the air).\n\n21\\. (With the words, 'Adoration be) to the goblins roaming by day,' (let him\nplace a Bali) on the sacrificial ground.\n\n22\\. (With the words, 'Adoration be to the goblins) roaming by night,' (let\nhim offer a Bali in the same place at the Vaisvadeva which takes place) at\nnight.\n\n23\\. Afterwards he must offer upon blades of Ku _s_ a grass, having the points\nturned towards the south, balls of rice to his father, to his grandfather, and\nto his great-grandfather, to his mother, to his grandmother, and to his great-\ngrandmother, proclaiming at the same time their name and race (and adding the\nword Svadha, 'reverence').\n\n24\\. Along with the balls of rice let him give ointments, flowers, incense,\neatables, and the like.\n\n25\\. After having fetched a jar with water, let him\n\n[24. 'And the like' means betel and the sacrificial fee for the Brahma _n_\nas.' (Nand.)\n\n25\\. This has to be done with the words, svastitva _m_ bruhi, 'say {footnote\np. 215} the benediction.' (Nand.) The benediction, according to Devapala,\nconsists of the Purushasukta, the Kanikrada (Va _g_ as. Sa _m_ h. XIII, 48),\nand other Mantras.]\n\np. 215\n\ncause a Brahma _n_ a to say the benediction (and give him the jar).\n\n26\\. (The share) of dogs, crows, and Svapa _k_ as let him strew upon the\nearth.\n\n27\\. And let him give (a mouthful of food as) alms.\n\n28\\. By honouring guests he obtains the highest reward.\n\n29\\. Let him assiduously honour a guest who arrives in the evening (after the\nVai _s_ vadeva is over).\n\n30\\. Let him not suffer a guest to stay at his house unfed.\n\n31\\. As the Brahma _n_ as are lords over all other castes, and as a husband is\nlord over his wives, a guest is the lord of a householder.\n\n32\\. By honouring a guest he obtains heaven.\n\n33\\. (One who has arrived as) a guest and is obliged to turn home disappointed\nin his expectations, takes away from the man, to whose house he has come, his\nreligious merit, and throws his own guilt upon him.\n\n34\\. A Brahma _n_ a who stays for one night only as a guest, is called atithi\n(a guest); because he does not stay for a long time, therefore is he termed\natithi.\n\n[27. According to Nand., who argues from a passage of Baudhayana. the particle\n_k_ a implies that he should feed Brahma _n_ as also.\n\n33\\. This proverb is also found in the Mahabharata XII, 6995, in the Hitopade\n_s_ a I, 56 (64 ed. Johnson), and in the Marka _nd_ eya-pura _n_ a XXIX, 31.\nSee Bohtlingk, Ind. Spruche, 134.\n\n34\\. Atithi in this derivation is supposed to mean one who does not stay for a\nwhole tithi or lunar day.']\n\np. 216\n\n35\\. Let him not consider a Brahma _n_ a fellow-villager or an acquaintance as\nhis guest, though he has come to the house where his wife and his fires are.\n\n16\\. But if a Kshatriya has come to his house in the way of a guest, let him\nhospitably entertain him also, to his heart's desire[1], after the Brahma _n_\na guests have eaten.\n\n37\\. Should a Vai _s_ ya or a _S_ udra come to his house as guests, he must\neven give food to them (at the same time and) with his servants, and treat\nthem with kindness (but not like guests in the proper sense of the term).\n\n38\\. To (members of) other castes (such as Murdhavasiktas) and to friends (or\nrelatives or) other such persons, who have come to his house out of\nattachment, let him offer such food as happens to be there, to the best of his\npower, at the time when his wife takes her meal.\n\n39\\. One recently married (but not yet delivered to her husband), an unmarried\ndamsel, a sick woman, and a pregnant woman: to these let him give food\nunhesitatingly, even before his guests.\n\n40\\. The foolish man who eats first himself, without having offered food to\nthose (persons that have been mentioned), is not aware that he will himself be\nfood (after death) for dogs and vultures.\n\n41\\. After the Brahma _n_ as, (the Kshatriyas who have come as guests), the\nfriends and relatives, (the parents and others) whom he is bound to maintain,\n\n[36. 1 This is Kulluka's rendering of the term kamam (on M III, 111).\nAccording to Nand., it means that he is at liberty to feed such guests or no.\n\n38\\. The wife takes her meal when the husband has eaten. (Nand.)]\n\np. 217\n\n(and the servants) have made their repast, let man and wife eat the leavings\nthemselves.\n\n42\\. Having shown honour to the gods, to the manes, to men, to those whom he\nis bound to maintain, and to the household deities (as well as to dogs, crows,\nand the rest), let a householder enjoy that which has been left.\n\n43\\. He who cooks food for himself only, cats nothing but sin: for that alone\nis considered as fit food for the virtuous, which is left, after the\n(customary) oblations have been offered.\n\n44\\. By the daily recitation of the Veda, by the Agnihotra, by sacrificing,\nand by austerity, a householder does not obtain such excellent places of abode\n(after death) as by honouring a guest.\n\n45\\. Whether he arrives in the evening or in the morning, he must offer a seat\nand water to his guest, and food, to the best of his ability, after having\nshown him marks of honour as the law directs[1].\n\n46\\. By giving (to a guest) shelter, a bed, ointments for his feet, and a\nlamp: for each of these gifts singly he reaps the same reward as for the gift\nof a cow.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXVIII.](sbe07070.htm)\n\n"
