(The Self consisting of bliss is the highest Self,) not the other (i.e.\nthe individual Soul), on account of the impossibility (of the latter\nassumption).\n\nAnd for the following reason also the Self consisting of bliss is the highest\nSelf only, not the other, i.e. the one which is other than the Lord, i.e. the\ntransmigrating individual soul. The personal soul cannot be denoted by the\nterm 'the one consisting of bliss.' Why? On account of the impossibility. For\nScripture says, with reference to the Self consisting of bliss, 'He wished,\nmay I be many, may I grow forth. He brooded over himself. After he had thus\nbrooded, he sent forth whatever there is.' Here, the desire arising before the\norigination of a body, &c., the non-separation of the effects created from the\ncreator, and the creation of all effects whatever, cannot possibly belong to\nany Self different from the highest Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 17](sbe34023.htm)\n\n"
