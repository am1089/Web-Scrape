Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Devar _s_ i! Sanatana, the son of Brahma, recites\nthus in the assembly of the Devas, the glories of the Bhagavan Ananta Deva,\nand worships Him, thus :-- How can one of ordinary sight and understanding\ngrasp the real nature of Brahma, Whose mere Glance enables the Prakriti work\nHer Gu _n_ as in the Creation, Preservation and Destruction of this Universe!\nHim Whose nature has no beginning nor end; Who though One, has created all\nthis Prapa\xc3\xb1cha (the universe of five elements) as a covering to the \xc3\x82tman (the\nTrue Self). He has made the Sat and Asat, out of his infinite compassion, this\nuniverse, full of cause and effect, visible in His One and only one S\xc2\x92uddha\nSattva nature where even the very powerful lion is imitating his Leela\n(Pastime), void of all defects, to bring under His control the minds of His\nown kinsmen. (Note :-- This Ananta Deva is the Ruling Principle in the Fourth\nDimensional Space.) To Whom else, then, the persons, desirous of Mok _s_ a,\nwill take refuge, the mere hearing or reciting Whose Name, in a fallen or a\ndistressed condition, or merely in jest, takes away instantly all the sins! He\nis upholding the earth with the mountains, oceans, rivers and all the beings\nas if an atom on his thousand heads. He is infinite. His power knows no\ndecrease in any time. No one can describe his actions even if one had thousand\ntongues to speak. He is of an infinite strength, of the endless high qualities\nand of unlimited understanding. Thus staying at the bottom of the earth, the\nBhagavan Ananta Deva is upholding with ease this earth for her protection,\nunaided and independent. O Muni! The people get the fruits of their actions\nand desires as they\n\n\n\np. 787\n\n\n\nwant and as they have followed the paths laid down in the S\xc2\x92astras and become\naccordingly kings, men, deer or birds or other creatures in other states. O\nNarada! This I have described, as you questioned me before, the various and\ndissimilar fruits of various actions, done according to the dictates of the\nDharma and the S\xc2\x92astras.\n\n\n\n10\\. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! Kindly describe to me now why has the\nBhagavan created so many diversities, when the Karmas, done by the Jivas, are\nthe same.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n11-28. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! So many different states arise because\nthe S\xc2\x92raddhas of the doers are so very different. The fruits differ because\nthe S\xc2\x92raddhas vary, some being Sattvik, some Rajasik and some Tamasik. If the\nS\xc2\x92raddha be Sattvik, happiness comes always; if it be Rajasik, incessant pain\nand misery is the result; if it be Tamasik, misery comes and the loss of the\nknowledge of good or bad is the result. Thus the fruits differ as the S\xc2\x92raddha\nvaries. O Best of Dvijas! Thousands and thousands of states occur to a man as\nthe result of their Karmas, done under the influence of the beginningless\nAvidya (Nescience). O Dvijottama! I will now deal in detail with their\nvarieties; hear. Behind this Triloki, below this earth and over the Atala, the\nPitris named Agni _s_ vattas and other forefathers live. Those Pitris stay\nthere, and, practising deep Samadhis, they offer always, to their best\nblessings to their own Gotra (families) respectively. There Yama, the God of\nthe Pitris gives punishment to the dead brought there by His messengers\naccording to their Karmas and faults. By the command of the Bhagavan, the\nYama, surrounded by his own Ga _n_ as (persons), judges and does full justice\naccording to the Karmas that they had done and the sins they had committed. He\nsends always those of his messengers who obey his order and know the Tattva of\nDharma, and who are posted to their respective duties to carry out what He\ncommands. The writers of the S\xc2\x92astras describe twenty-one Narakas or hells;\nothers say there are twenty-eight hells. Now hear their names :-- Tamisra,\nAndha Tamisra, Raurava, Maharaurava, Kumbhipaka, Kalasutra, Asipatrakanana,\nS\xc2\x92ukaramukha, Andhakupa, Krimibhojana, Taptamurti, Samdams\xc2\x92a, Vajraka _nt_\naka, S\xc2\x92almali, Vaitara _n_ i, Puyoda, Pra _n_ arodha, Vis\xc2\x92asana, Lalabhak _s_\na, Sarameyadana, Avichi, Apahpana, K _s_ arakardama, Rak _s_ oga _n_ a,\nSambhoja, S\xc2\x92ulaprota, Dandas\xc2\x92uka, Ava _t_ arodha, Paryavartanaka, and\nSuchimukha. These are the twenty-eight Narakas or hells. (N.B. These are 29).\n\n\n\nThese hells are very tormenting. O Son of Brahma! The embodied beings (jivas)\nsuffer these according to their own Karmas respectively.\n\n\n\np. 788\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-first Chapter of the Eighth Book on the narrative of\nhells in the Maha Pura _n_ am, S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 22](bk08ch22.htm)\n\n'
