[1b](ry310.htm#fn_643)  \nTen million million demons guard  \nThe gates of Lanka firmly barred.  \nAll hope until that host be slain,  \nTo smite the robber king is vain.  \nNor with Sugriva's aid alone  \nMay king and host be overthrown.  \nThus ere he died--for well he knew--  \nSpake Bali, and his words are true.  \nI know not what his proofs might be,  \nBut speak the words he spake to me.  \nHence far and wide our lords are sent  \nTo raise the mightiest armament.  \nFor their return Sugriva waits  \nEre he can sally from his gates.  \nStill is the oath Sugriva swore  \nKept firmly even as before:  \nAnd the great host this day will be  \nAssembled by the king's decree,  \nTen thousand thousand troops, who wear  \nThe form of monkey and of bear,  \nPrepared for thee the war to wage:  \nThen let thy wrath no longer rage.  \nThe matrons of the Vanar race  \nSee marks of fury in thy face;  \nThey see thine eyes like blood are red,  \nAnd will not yet be comforted.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[367:1](ry309.htm#fr_642) The story is told in Book 1.
