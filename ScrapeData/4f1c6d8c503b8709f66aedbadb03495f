Dutt\n\n## (1899)\n\n# THE EPIC OF THE BHARATAS\n\n# BOOK I\n\n# ASTRA DARSANA\n\n_\n\n(The Tournament)\n\n_\n\nTHE scene of the Epic is the ancient kingdom of the Kurus which flourished\nalong the upper course of the Ganges; and the historical fact on which the\nEpic is based is a great war which took place between the Kurus and a\nneighbouring tribe, the Panchalas, in the thirteenth or fourteenth century\nbefore Christ.\n\nAccording to the Epic, Pandu and Dhrita-rashtra, who was born blind, were\nbrothers. Pandu died early, and Dhrita-rashtra became king of the Kurus, and\nbrought up the five sons of Pandu along with his hundred sons.\n\nYudhishthir, the eldest son of Pandu, was a man of truth and piety; Bhima, the\nsecond, was a stalwart fighter; and Arjun, the third son, distinguished\nhimself above all the other princes in arms. The two youngest brothers, Nakula\nand Sahadeva, were twins. Duryodhan was the eldest son of Dhrita-rashtra and\nwas jealous of his cousins, the sons of Pandu. A tournament was held, and in\nthe course of the day a warrior named Karna., of unknown origin, appeared on\nthe scene and proved himself a worthy rival of Arjun. The rivalry between\nArjun and Karna is the leading thought of the Epic, as the rivalry between\nAchilles and Hector is the leading thought of the Iliad.\n\nIt is only necessary to add that the sons of Pandu. as well as Karna, were,\nlike the heroes of Homer, god-born chiefs. Some god inspired the birth of\neach. Yudhishthir was the son of Dharma or Virtue, Bhima of Vayu or Wind,\nArjun of Indra or Rain-god, the twin youngest were the sons of the Aswin\ntwins, and Karna was the son of Surya the Sun, but was believed by himself and\nby all others to be the son of a simple chariot-driver.\n\nThe portion translated in this Book forms Sections cxxxiv. to cxxxvii. of Book\ni. of the original Epic in Sanscrit (Calcutta edition of 1834).\n\n## I\n\n## THE GATHERING\n\nWrathful sons of Dhrita-rashtra, born of Kuru\'s royal race,  \nRighteous sons of noble Pandu, god-born men of godlike grace,\n\nSkill in arms attained these princes from a Brahman warrior bold,  \nDrona, priest and proud preceptor, peerless chief of days of old!\n\nOut spake Drona to the monarch in Hastina\'s royal hall,  \nSpake to Bhishma and to Kripa, spake to lords and courtiers all:\n\n"Mark the gallant princes, monarch, trained in arms and warlike art,  \nLet them prove their skill and valour, rein the steed and throw the dart."\n\nAnswered then the ancient monarch, joyful was his royal heart.  \n"Best of Brahmans and of warriors, nobly hast thou done thy part,\n\nName the place and fix the moment, hold a royal tournament,  \nPublish wide the laws of combat, publish far thy king\'s consent.\n\nSightless roll these orbs of vision, dark to me is noonday light,  \nHappier men will mark the tourney and the peerless princes\' fight,\n\nLet the good and wise Vidura serve thy mandate and behest,  \nLet a father\'s pride and gladness fill this old and cheerless breast."\n\nForthwith went the wise Vidura to his sacred duties bound,  \nDrona, blessed with skill and wisdom, measured out the tourney ground,\n\nClear of jungle was the meadow, by a crystal fountain graced,  \nDrona on the lighted altar holy gifts and offerings placed,\n\nHoly was the star auspicious, and the hour was calm and bright,  \nMen from distant town and hamlet came to view the sacred rite.\n\nThen arose white stately mansions, built by architects of fame,  \nDecked with arms for Kuru\'s monarch and for every royal dame,\n\nAnd the people built their stages circling round the listed green,  \nAnd the nobles with their white tents graced the fair and festive scene.\n\nBrightly dawned the festal morning, and the monarch left his hall,  \nBhishma and the pious Kripa with the lords and courtiers all,\n\nAnd they came unto the mansions, gay and glittering, gold-encased,  \nDecked with gems and rich _baidurya_ , and with strings of pearls be-laced.\n\nFair Gandhari, queen of Kuru, Pritha, Pandu\'s widowed dame,  \nLadies in their gorgeous garments, maids of beauty and of fame,\n\nMounted on their glittering mansions where the tints harmonious blend,  \nAs, on Meru\'s golden mountain, queens of heavenly gods ascend!\n\nAnd the people of the city, Brahmans, Vaisyas, Kshatras bold,  \nMen from stall and loom and anvil gathered thick, the young and old,\n\nAnd arose the sound of trumpet and the surging people\'s cry.  \nLike the voice of angry ocean, tempest-lashed, sublime and high!\n\nCame the saintly white-robed Drona, white his sacrificial thread,  \nWhite his sandal-mark and garlands, white the locks that crowned his head,\n\nWith his son renowned for valour walked forth Drona, radiant, high,  \nSo the Moon with Mars conjoined walks upon the cloudless sky!\n\nOfferings to the gods immortal then the priestly warrior made,  \nBrahmans with their chanted _mantra_ worship and obeisance paid,\n\nAnd the festive note of _sankha_ mingled with the trumpet\'s sound,  \nThrongs of warriors, various-armed, came unto the listed ground.\n\n## II\n\n## The Princes\n\nGauntleted and jewel-girdled, now the warlike princes came,  \nWith their stately bows and quivers, and their swords like wreaths of flame,\n\nEach behind his elder stepping, good Yudhishthir first of all,  \nEach his wondrous skill displaying held the silent crowds in thrall.\n\nAnd the men in admiration marked them with a joyful eye,  \nOr by sudden panic stricken stooped to let the arrow fly!\n\nMounted on their rapid coursers oft the princes proved their aim,  \nRacing, hit the target with arrows lettered with their royal name,\n\nWith their glinting sunlit weapons shone the youths sublime and high,  \nMore than mortals seemed the princes, bright _Gandharvas_ of the sky!\n\nShouts of joy the people uttered as by sudden impulse driven.  \nMingled voice of tens of thousands struck the pealing vault of heaven.\n\nStill the princes shook their weapons, drove the deep resounding car,  \nOr on steed or tusker mounted waged the glorious mimic war!\n\nMighty sword and ample buckler, ponderous mace the princes wield,  \nBrightly gleam their lightning rapiers as they range the listed field,\n\nBrave and fearless is their action, and their movement quick and light  \nSkilled and true the thrust and parry of their weapons flaming bright!\n\n## III\n\n## BHIMA AND DURYODHAN\n\nBhima came and proud Duryodhan with their maces lifted high,  \nLike two cliffs with lofty turrets cleaving through the azure sky,\n\nIn their warlike arms accoutred with their girded loins they stood,  \nLike two untamed jungle tuskers in the deep and echoing wood!\n\nAnd as tuskers range the forest, so they range the spacious field,  \nRight to left and back they wander and their ponderous maces wield,\n\nUnto Kuru\'s sightless monarch wise Vidura drew the scene,  \nPritha proudly of the princes spake unto the Kuru queen.\n\nWhile the stalwart Bhima battled with Duryodhan brave and strong,  \nFierce in wrath, for one or other, shouted forth the maddened throng,\n\n"Hail to Kuru prince Duryodhan!" "Hail to Bhima hero proud!"  \nSounds like these from surging myriads rose in tumult deep and loud,\n\nAnd with troubled vision Drona marked the heaving restless plain,  \nMarked the crowd by anger shaken, like the tempest-shaken main,\n\nTo his son he softly whispered quick the tumult to appease,  \nPart the armed and angry wrestlers, bid the deadly combat cease,\n\nWith their lifted clubs the princes slow retired on signal given,  \nLike the parting of the billows, mighty-heaving, tempest-driven!\n\nCame forth then the ancient Drona on the open battle-ground,  \nStopped the drum and lofty trumpet, spake in voice like thunder\'s sound:\n\n"Bid him come, the gallant Arjun! pious prince and warrior skilled,  \nArjun, born of mighty INDRA, and with VISHNU\'S prowess filled."\n\n## IV\n\n## THE ADVENT OF ARJUN\n\nGauntleted and jewel-girdled, with his bow of ample height,  \nArcher Arjun pious-hearted to the gods performed a rite,\n\nThen he stepped forth proud and stately in his golden mail encased,  \nLike the sunlit cloud of evening with the golden rainbow graced,\n\nAnd a gladness stirred the people all around the listed plain,  \nVoice of drum and blare of trumpet rose with _sankha\'s_ festive strain!\n\n"Mark! the gallant son of Pandu, whom the happy Pritha bore,  \nMark! the heir of INDRA\'S valour, matchless in his arms and lore,\n\nMark! the warrior young and valiant, peerless in his skill of arms,  \nMark! the prince of stainless virtue, decked with grace and varied charms!"\n\nPritha heard such grateful voices borne aloft unto the sky,  \nMilk of love suffused her bosom, tear of joy was in her eye!\n\nAnd where rested Kuru\'s monarch, joyous accents struck his ear,  \nAnd he turned to wise Vidura seeking for the cause to hear:\n\n"Wherefore like the voice of ocean, when the tempest winds prevail,  \nRise the voices of the people and the spacious skies assail?"\n\nAnswered him the wise Vidura, "It is Pritha\'s gallant boy,  \nGodlike moves in golden armour, and the people shout for joy!"\n\n"Pleased am I." so spake the monarch," and I bless my happy fate,  \nPritha\'s sons like fires of _yajna_ sanctify this mighty State!"\n\nNow the voices of the people died away and all was still,  \nArjun to his proud preceptor showed his might and matchless skill.\n\nTowering high or lowly bending, on the turf or on his car,  \nWith his bow and glist\'ning arrows. Arjun waged the mimic war,\n\nTargets on the wide arena, mighty tough or wondrous small,  \nWith his arrows still unfailing, Arjun pierced them one and all!\n\nWild-boar shaped in plates of iron coursed the wide-extending field,  \nIn its jaws five glist\'ning arrows sent the archer wondrous-skilled,\n\nCow-horn by a thread suspended was by winds unceasing swayed,  \nOne and twenty well-aimed arrows on this moving mark he laid,\n\nAnd with equal skill his rapier did the godlike Arjun wield,  \nWhirling round the mace of battle ranged the spacious tourney field!\n\n## V\n\n## THE ADVENT OF KARNA\n\nNow the feats of arm are ended, and the closing hour draws nigh,  \nMusic\'s voice is hushed in silence, and dispersing crowds pass by,\n\nHark! Like welkin-shaking thunder wakes a deep and deadly sound,  \nClank and din of warlike weapons burst upon the tented ground!\n\nAre the solid mountains splitting, is it bursting of the earth.  \nIs it tempest\'s pealing accent whence the lightning takes its birth?\n\nThoughts like these alarm the people for the sound is dread and high,  \nTo the gaze of the arena turns the crowd with anxious eye!\n\nGathered round preceptor Drona, Pandu\'s sons in armour bright,  \nLike the five-starred constellation round the radiant Queen of Night,\n\nGathered round the proud Duryodhan, dreaded for his exploits done,  \nAll his brave and warlike brothers and preceptor Drona\'s son,\n\nSo the gods encircled INDRA, thunder-wielding, fierce and bold,  \nWhen he scattered Danu\'s children in the misty days of old!\n\nPale, before the unknown warrior, gathered nations part in twain,  \nConqueror of hostile cities, lofty Karna treads the plain,\n\nIn his golden mail accoutred. and his rings of yellow gold,  \nLike a moving cliff in stature, armed comes the chieftain bold,\n\nPritha, yet unwedded, bore him, peerless archer on the earth,  \nPortion of the solar radiance, for the Sun inspired his birth!\n\nLike a tusker in his fury, like a lion in his ire,  \nLike the sun in noontide radiance, like the all-consuming fire,\n\nLion-like in build and muscle, stately as a golden palm,  \nBlessed with every very manly virtue, peerless, dauntless, proud and calm!\n\nWith his looks serene and lofty field of war the chief surveyed,  \nScarce to Kripa or to Drona honour and obeisance made,\n\nStill the panic-stricken people viewed him with unmoving gaze,  \nWho maybe this unknown warrior, questioned they in hushed amaze!\n\nThen in voice of pealing thunder spake fair Pritha\'s eldest son  \nUnto Arjun, Pritha\'s youngest, each, alas! to each unknown:\n\n"All thy feats of weapons, Arjun, done with vain and needless boast,  \nThese and greater I accomplish-witness be this mighty host!"\n\nThus spake proud and peerless Karna in his accents deep and loud,  \nAnd as moved by sudden impulse joyous rose the listening crowd,\n\nAnd a gleam of mighty transport glows in proud Duryodhan\'s heart,  \nFlames of wrath and jealous anger from the eyes of Arjun start,\n\nDrona gave the word, and Karna, Pritha\'s war-beloving son,  \nWith his sword and with his arrows did the feats by Arjun done!\n\n## VI\n\n## THE RIVAL WARRIORS\n\nJoyful was the proud Duryodhan, gladness gleamed upon his face,  \nAnd he spake to gallant Karna with a loving fond embrace:\n\n"Welcome, mighty armed chieftain! thou hast victor\'s honours won,  \nThine is all my wealth and kingdom, name thy wish and it is done!"\n\nAnswered Karna to Duryodhan, " Prince! thy word is good as deed,  \nBut I seek to combat Arjun and to win the victor\'s meed,"\n\n"Noble is the boon thou seekest," answered Kuru\'s prince of fame,  \n"Be a joy unto your comrades, let the foeman dread thy name!\n\nAnger flamed in Arjun\'s bosom, and he spake in accents rude  \nUnto Karna who in triumph calm and proud and fearless stood:\n\n"Chief! who eomest uninvited, pratest in thy lying boast,  \nThou shalt die the death of braggarts-witness be this mighty host!\n\nKarna answered calm and proudly, "Free this listed field to all,  \nWarriors enter by their prowess, wait not, Arjun, for thy call,\n\nWarlike chieftains take their places by their strength of arm and might,  \nAnd their warrant is their falchion, valour sanctifies their right,\n\nAngry word is coward\'s weapon, Arjun, speak with arrows keen,  \nTill I lay thee, witness Drona, low upon the listed green!"\n\nDrona. gave the word impartial, wrathful Arjun, dread of foes,  \nParted from his loving brothers, in his glist\'ning arms arose,\n\nKarna clasped the Kuru\'s princes, parted from them one and all,  \nWith his bow and ample quiver proudly stepped the warrior tall.\n\nNow the clouds with lurid flashes gathered darkling, thick and high,  \nLines of cranes like gleams of laughter sailed across the gloomy sky.\n\nRain-god INDRA over Arjun watched with father\'s partial love,  \nSun-god SURYA over Karna shed his light from far above,\n\nArjun stood in darkening shadow by the inky clouds concealed,  \nBold and bright in open sunshine radiant Karna stood revealed!\n\nProud Duryodhan and his brothers stood by Karna calm and bold  \nDrona stood by gallant Arjun, and brave Bhishma warrior old,\n\nWomen too with partial glances viewed the one or other chief,  \nBut by equal love divided silent Pritha swooned in grief!\n\nWise Vidura, true to duty, with an anxious hurry came,  \nSandal-drops and sprinkled waters roused the woe-distracted dame,\n\nAnd she saw her sons in combat, words of woe she uttered none,  \nSpeechless wept, for none must fathom Karna was her eldest son!\n\n## VII\n\n## THE ANOINTMENT OF KARNA\n\nCrested Karna, helmed Arjun, proudly trod the spacious green,  \nKripa, skilled in herald\'s duties, spake upon the dreadful scene:\n\n_\n\n"This is helmet-wearing Arjun, sprung of Kuru\'s mighty race,  \nPandu\'s son and borne by Pritha, prince of worth and warlike grace,\n\nLong-armed Chief! declare thy lineage, and the race thou dost adorn,  \nName thy mother and thy father, and the house that saw thee born,\n\nBy the rules of war Prince Arjun claims his rival chief to know,  \nPrinces may not draw their weapon \'gainst a base and nameless foe!"\n\n_\n\nKarna silent heard this mandate, rank nor lineage could he claim,  \nLike a raindrop-pelted lotus bent his humble head in shame!\n\n"Prince we reckon," cried Duryodhan, "not the man of birth alone  \nWarlike leader of his forces as a prince and chief we own,\n\nKarna by his warlike valour is of crowned kings the peer,  \nKarna shall be crowned monarch, nations shall his mandate hear!"\n\nForth they brought the corn and treasure, golden coin and water jar,  \nOn the throne they seated Karna famed in many a deathful war,\n\nBrahmans chanted sacred _mantra_ which the holy books ordain,  \nAnd anointed crowned Karna king of Anga\'s fair domain,\n\nAnd they raised the red umbrella, and they waved the _chowri_ fan,  \n"Blessings on the crowned monarch! honour to the bravest man!"\n\n\'Now the holy rites accomplished, in his kingly robes arrayed  \nKarna unto prince Duryodhan thus in grateful accents prayed:\n\n"Gift of kingdom, good Duryodhan, speaketh well thy noble heart,  \nWhat return can grateful Karna humbly render on his part?"\n\n"Grant thy friendship," cried Duryodhan, "for no other boon crave,  \nBe Duryodhan\'s dearest comrade, be his helper true and brave,"\n\n"Be it so!" responded Karna, with a proud and noble grace,  \nAnd he sealed his loyal friendship in a loving fond embrace!\n\n## VIII\n\n## THE CHARIOT-DRIVER\n\nDewed with drops of toil and languor, lo,! a chariot-driver came,  \nLoosely hung his scanty garments, and a staff upheld his frame,\n\nKarna, now a crowned monarch, to the humble Suta sped,  \nAs a son unto a father, reverently bent his head!\n\nWith his scanty cloth the driver sought his dusty feet to hide,  \nAnd he hailed him as a father hails his offspring in his pride,\n\nAnd he clasped unto his bosom crowned Karna\'s noble head,  \nAnd on Karna\'s dripping forehead, fresh and loving tear-drops shed!\n\nIs he son of chariot-driver? Doubts arose in Bhima\'s mind,  \nAnd he sought to humble Karna with reproachful words unkind\n\n"Wilt thou, high-descended hero, with a Kuru cross thy brand?  \nBut the goad of cattle-drivers better suits, my friend, thy hand!\n\nWilt thou as a crowned monarch rule a mighty nation\'s weal?  \nAs the jackals of the jungle sacrificial offerings steal!"\n\nQuivered Karna\'s lips in anger, word of answer spake he none,  \nBut a deep sigh shook his bosom, and he gazed upon the sun!\n\nIX\n\nCLOSE OF THE DAY\n\nLike a lordly tusker rising from a beauteous lotus lake,  \nRose Duryodhan from his brothers, proudly thus to Bhima spake:\n\n"With such insults seek not, Bhima, thus to cause a warrior grief,  \nBitter taunts but ill befit thee, warlike tiger-waisted chief,\n\nProudest chief may fight the humblest, for like river\'s noble course,  \nNoble deeds proclaim the warrior, and we question not their source!\n\nTeacher Drona, priest and warrior, owns a poor and humble birth,  \nKripa, noblest of Gautamas, springeth from the lowly earth,\n\nKnown to me thy lineage Bhima, thine and of thy brothers four,  \nAmorous gods your birth imparted, so they say, in days of yore!\n\nMark the great and gallant Karna decked in rings and weapons fair  \nShe-deer breeds not lordly tigers in her poor and lowly lair,\n\nKarna comes to rule the wide earth, not fair Anga\'s realms alone,  \nBy his valour and his virtue, by the homage which I own,\n\nAnd if prince or armed chieftain doth my word or deed gainsay,  \nLet him take his bow and quiver, meet me in a deadly fray!"\n\nLoud applauses greet the challenge and the people\'s joyful cry,  \nBut the thickening shades of darkness fill the earth and evening sky\n\nAnd the red lamp\'s fitful lustre shone upon the field around,  \nSlowly with the peerless Karna proud Duryodhan left the ground.\n\nPandu\'s sons with warlike Drona marked the darksome close of day  \nAnd with Kripa and with Bhishma homeward silent bent their way\n\n"Arjun is the gallant victor!" "Valiant Karna\'s won the day!"  \n"Prince Duryodhan is the winner!" Various thus the people say\n\nBy some secret sign apprised Pritha knew her gallant boy,  \nSaw him crowned king of Anga, with a mother\'s secret joy,\n\nAnd with greater joy Duryodhan fastened Karna to his side,  \nFeared no longer Arjun\'s prowess, Arjun\'s skill of arms and pride\n\nE\'en Yudhishthir reckoned Karna mightiest warrior on the earth,  \nHalf misdoubted Arjun\'s prowess, Arjun\'s, skill and warlike worth!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book II: The Bride\'s Choice](maha02.htm)\n\n'
