 \nAnd shall our banded strength be weak  \nTo gain the realm which now I seek?  \nA happy fate was mine above  \nMy kith and kin and all I love.  \nWhen, near the witness fire, I won  \nThy friendship, Raghu's glorious son.  \nThou too in ripening time shall see  \nThy friend not all unworthy thee.  \nWhat gifts I have shall thus be shown:  \nNot mine the tongue to make them known.  \nStrong is the changeless bond that binds  \nThe friendly faith of noble minds.  \nIn woe, in danger, firm and sure  \nTheir constancy and love endure.  \nGold, silver, jewels rich and rare  \nThey count as wealth for friends to share.  \n\np. 332  \n\nYea, be they rich or poor and low,  \nBlest with all joys or sunk in woe,  \nStained with each fault or pure of blame,  \nTheir friends the nearest place may claim;  \nFor whom they leave, at friendship's call,  \nTheir gold, their bliss, their homes and all,  \n   He spoke by generous impulse moved,  \nAnd Raghu's son his speech approved  \nGlancing at Lakshman by his side,  \nLike Indra in his beauty's pride.  \nThe Vanar monarch saw the pair  \nOf mighty brothers standing there,  \nAnd turned his rapid eye to view  \nThe forest trees that near him grew.  \nHe saw, not far from where he stood,  \nA Sal tree towering o'er the wood.  \nAmid the thick leaves many a bee  \nGraced the scant blossoms of the tree,  \nFrom whose dark shade a bough, that bore  \nA load of leafy twigs, he tore,  \nWhich on the grassy ground he laid  \nAnd seats for him and Rama made,  \nHanuman saw them sit, he sought  \nA Sal tree's leafy bough and brought  \nThe burthen, and with meek request  \nEntreated Lakshman, too, to rest.  \nThere on the noble mountain's brow,  \nStrewn with the young leaves of the bough,  \nSat Raghu's son in placid ease  \nCalm as the sea when sleeps the breeze.  \nSugriva's heart with rapture swelled,  \nAnd thus, by eager love impelled,  \nHe spoke in gracious tone, that, oft  \nChecked by his joy, was low and soft:  \n'I, by my brother's might oppressed,  \nBy ceaseless woe and fear distressed,  \nMourning my consort far away,  \nOn Rishyamuka's mountain stray.  \nExpelled by Bali's cruel hate  \nI wander here disconsolate.  \nDo thou to whom all sufferers flee,  \nFrom his dread hand deliver me.'  \n   He spoke, and Rama, just and brave,  \nWhose pious soul to virtue clave,  \nSmiled as in conscious might he eyed  \nThe king of Vanars, and replied:  \n'Best fruit of friendship is the deed  \nThat helps the friend in hour of need;  \nAnd this mine arm in death shall lay  \nThy robber ere the close of day.  \nFor see, these feathered darts of mine  \nWhose points so fiercely flash and shine,  \nAnd shafts with golden emblem, came  \nFrom dark woods known by Skanda's name, 1  \n\nWinged from the pinion of the hern  \nLike Indra's bolts they strike and burn.  \nWith even knots and piercing head  \nEach like a furious snake is sped;  \nWith these, to-day, before thine eye  \nShall, like a shattered mountain, lie  \nBali, thy dread and wicked foe,  \nO'erwhelmed in hideous overthrow.'  \n   He spoke: Sugriva's bosom swelled  \nWith hope and joy unparalleled.  \nThen his glad voice the Vanar raised,  \nAnd thus the son of Raghu praised:  \n'Long have I pined in depth of grief;  \nThou art the hope of all, O chief.  \nNow, Raghu's son, I bail thee friend,  \nAnd bid thee to my woes attend;  \nFor, by ray truth I swear it, now  \nNot life itself is dear as thou,  \nSince by the witness fire we met  \nAnd friendly hand in hand was set.  \nFriend communes now with friend, and hence  \nI tell with surest confidence,  \nHow woes that on my spirit weigh  \nConsume me through the night and day.'  \n   For sobs and sighs he scarce could speak,  \nAnd his sad voice came low and weak,  \nAs, while his eyes with tears o'erflowed,  \nThe burden of his soul he showed.  \nThen by strong effort, bravely made,  \nThe torrent of his tears he stayed,  \nWiped his bright eyes, his grief subdued,  \nAnd thus, more calm, his speech renewed:  \n'By Bali's conquering might oppressed,  \nOf power and kingship dispossessed,  \nLoaded with taunts of scorn and hate  \nI left my realm and royal state.  \nHe tore away my consort: she  \nWas dearer than my life to me,  \nAnd many a friend to me and mine  \nIn hopeless chains was doomed to pine.  \nWith wicked thoughts, unsated still,  \nMe whom he wrongs he yearns to kill;  \nAnd spies of Vanar race, who tried  \nTo slay me, by this hand have died.  \nMoved by this constant doubt and fear  \nI saw thee, Prince, and came not near.  \nWhen woe and peril gather rouud  \nA foe in every form is found.  \nSave Hanuman, O Raghu's son,  \nAnd these, no friend is left me, none.  \nThrough their kind aid, a faithful band  \nWho guard their lord from hostile hand,  \nRest when their chieftain rests and bend  \nTheir steps where'er he lists to wend,--  \nThrough them alone, in toil and pain,  \nMy wretched life I still sustain.  \n\np. 333  \n\nEnough, for thou hast heard in brief  \nThe story of my pain and grief.  \nHis mighty strength all regions know,  \nMy brother, but my deadly foe.  \nAh, if the proud oppressor fell,  \nHis death would all my woe dispel.  \nYea, on my cruel conqueror's fall  \nMy joy depends, my life, my all.  \nThis were the end and sure relief,  \nO Rama, of my tale of grief.  \nFair be his lot or dark with woe.  \nNo comfort like a friend I know.'  \n   Then Rama spoke: 'O friend, relate  \nWhence sprang fraternal strife and hate,  \nThat duly taught by thee, I may  \nEach foeman's strength and weakness weigh:  \nAnd skilled in every chance restore  \nThe blissful state thou hadst before.  \nFor, when I think of all the scorn  \nAnd bitter woe thou long hast borne.  \nMy soul indignant swells with pain  \nLike waters flushed with furious rain.  \nThen, ere I string this bended bow,  \nTell me the tale I long to know,  \nEre from the cord my arrow fly,  \nAnd low in death thy foeman lie.'  \n   He spoke: Sugriva joyed to hear,  \nNor less his lords were glad of cheer:  \nAnd thus to Rama mighty-souled  \nThe cause that moved their strife he told;
