VIII.\n\nOrigin of Rudra: his becoming eight Rudras: their wives and children. The\nposterity of Bhrigu. Account of \xc5\x9ari in conjunction with Vishn\xcc\x81u. Sacrifice of\nDaksha.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--I have described to you, oh great Muni, the creation of Brahma, in\nwhich the quality of darkness prevailed. I will now explain to you the\ncreation of Rudra 1.\n\nIn the beginning of the Kalpa, as Brahma purposed to create a son, who should\nbe like himself, a youth of a purple complexion 2 appeared, crying with a low\ncry, and running about 3. Brahma, when he beheld him thus afflicted, said to\nhim, "Why dost thou weep?" "Give me a name," replied the boy. "Rudra be thy\nname," rejoined the great father of all creatures: "be composed; desist from\ntears." But, thus addressed, the boy still wept seven times, and Brahma\ntherefore gave to him seven other denominations; and to these eight persons\nregions and wives and posterity belong. The eight manifestations, then, are\nnamed Rudra, Bhava, \xc5\x9aarva, I\xc5\x9bana, Pa\xc5\x9bupati, Bhima, Ugra, and Mahadeva, which\nwere given to them by their great progenitor. He also assigned to them their\nrespective stations, the sun, water, earth, air, fire, ether, the ministrant\nBrahman, and the moon; for these are their several forms 4. The wives\n\np. 59\n\nof the sun and the other manifestations, termed Rudra and the rest, were\nrespectively, Suverchala, Usha, Vikesi, Siva, Swaha, Di\xc5\x9ba, Diksha, and Rohini.\nNow hear an account of their progeny, by whose successive generations this\nworld has been peopled. Their sons, then, were severally, Sanai\xc5\x9bchara\n(Saturn), \xc5\x9aukra (Venus), the fiery-bodied Mars, Manojava (Hanuman), Skanda,\nSwarga, Santana, and Budha (Mercury).\n\nIt was the Rudra of this description that married Sati, who abandoned her\ncorporeal existence in consequence of the displeasure of Daksha 5. She\nafterwards was the daughter of Himavan (the snowy mountains) by Mena; and in\nthat character, as the only Uma, the mighty Bhava again married her 6. The\ndivinities Dhata and Vidhata were born to Bhrigu by Khyati, as was a daughter,\n\xc5\x9ari, the wife of Narayan\xcc\x81a, the god of gods 7.\n\nMAITREYA.--It is commonly said that the goddess \xc5\x9ari was born from the sea of\nmilk, when it was churned for ambrosia; how then can you say that she was the\ndaughter of Bhrigu by Khyati.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--\xc5\x9ari, the bride of Vishn\xcc\x81u, the mother of the world, is\n\np. 60\n\neternal, imperishable; in like manner as he is all-pervading, so also is she,\noh best of Brahmans, omnipresent. Vishn\xcc\x81u is meaning; she is speech. Hari is\npolity (Naya); she is prudence (Niti). Vishn\xcc\x81u is understanding; she is\nintellect. He is righteousness; she is devotion. He is the creator; she is\ncreation. \xc5\x9ari is the earth; Hari the support of it. The deity is content; the\neternal Lakshmi is resignation. He is desire; \xc5\x9ari is wish. He is sacrifice;\nshe is sacrificial donation (Dakshina). The goddess is the invocation which\nattends the oblation; Janarddana is the oblation. Lakshmi is the chamber where\nthe females are present (at a religious ceremony); Madhusudana the apartment\nof the males of the family. Lakshmi is the altar; Hari the stake (to which the\nvictim is bound). \xc5\x9ari is the fuel; Hari the holy grass (Ku\xc5\x9ba). He is the\npersonified Sama veda; the goddess, lotus-throned, is the tone of its\nchanting. Lakshmi is the prayer of oblation (Swaha); Vasudeva, the lord of the\nworld, is the sacrificial fire. Sauri (Vishn\xcc\x81u) is \xc5\x9aankara (\xc5\x9aiva); and \xc5\x9ari is\nthe bride of \xc5\x9aiva (Gauri). Ke\xc5\x9bava, oh Maitreya, is the sun; and his radiance\nis the lotus-seated goddess. Vishn\xcc\x81u is the tribe of progenitors (Pitrigana);\nPadma. is their bride (Swadha), the eternal bestower of nutriment. \xc5\x9ari is the\nheavens; Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is one with all things, is wide extended space. The lord\nof \xc5\x9ari is the moon; she is his unfading light. She is called the moving\nprinciple of the world; he, the wind which bloweth every where. Govinda is the\nocean; Lakshmi its shore. Lakshmi is the consort of Indra (Indrani);\nMadhusudana is Devendra. The holder of the discus (Vishn\xcc\x81u) is Yama (the\nregent of Tartarus); the lotus-throned goddess is his dusky spouse (Dhumorna).\n\xc5\x9ari is wealth; \xc5\x9aridhara (Vishn\xcc\x81u) is himself the god of riches (Kuvera).\nLakshmi, illustrious Brahman, is Gauri; and Ke\xc5\x9bava, is the deity of ocean\n(Varuna). \xc5\x9ari is the host of heaven (Devasena); the deity of war, her lord, is\nHari. The wielder of the mace is resistance; the power to oppose is \xc5\x9ari.\nLakshmi is the Kasht\xcc\x81ha and the Kala; Hari the Nimesha and the Muhurtta.\nLakshmi is the light; and Hari, who is all, and lord of all, the lamp. She,\nthe mother of the world, is the creeping vine; and Vishn\xcc\x81u the tree round\nwhich she clings. She is the night; the god who is armed with the mace and\ndiscus is the day. He, the bestower of blessings, is the bridegroom; the\nlotus-throned goddess is the bride.\n\np. 61\n\n[paragraph continues] The god is one with all male--the goddess one with all\nfemale, rivers. The lotus-eyed deity is the standard; the goddess seated on a\nlotus the banner. Lakshmi is cupidity; Narayan\xcc\x81a, the master of the world, is\ncovetousness. Oh thou who knowest what righteousness is, Govinda is love; and\nLakshmi, his gentle spouse, is pleasure. But why thus diffusely enumerate\ntheir presence: it is enough to say, in a word, that of gods, animals, and\nmen, Hari is all that is called male; Lakshmi is all that is termed female:\nthere is nothing else than they.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:1](vp042.htm#fr_214) The creation of Rudra has been already adverted to,\nand that seems to be the primitive form of the legend. We have here another\naccount, grounded apparently upon \xc5\x9aaiva or Yogi mysticism.\n\n[58:2](vp042.htm#fr_215) The appearance of Rudra as a Kumara, \'a boy,\' is\ndescribed as of repeated occurrence in the Linga and Vayu Puran\xcc\x81as, as already\nnoticed ([p. 38](vp039.htm#page_38)); and these Kumaras are of different\ncomplexions in different Kalpas. In the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Puran\xcc\x81as, however, we have\nonly one original form, to which the name of Nilalohita, the blue and red or\npurple complexioned is assigned. In the Kurma this youth comes from Brahma\'s\nmouth: in the Vayu, from his forehead.\n\n[58:3](vp042.htm#fr_216) This is the Pauran\xcc\x81ic etymology: ### or rud, \'to\nweep,\' and dru, \'to run\' The grammarians derive the name from rud, \'to weep,\'\nwith ra affix.\n\n[58:4](vp042.htm#fr_217) The Vayu details the application of each name\nseverally. These eight Rudras are therefore but one, under as many\nappellations, and in as many types. The Padma, Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, Kurma, Linga, and\nVayu agree with our text in the nomenclature of the Rudras, and their types,\ntheir wives, and progeny. The types are those which are enumerated in the\nNandi, p. 59 or opening benedictory verse, of Sakuntala; and the passage of\nthe Vishn\xcc\x81u P. was found by Mons. Chezy on the envelope of his copy. He has\njustly corrected Sir Wm. Jones\'s version of the term ### \'the sacrifice is\nperformed with solemnity;\' as the word means, \'Brahmane officiant,\' \'the\nBrahman\xcc\x81 who is qualified by initiation (Diksha) to conduct the rite.\' These\nare considered as the bodies, or visible forms, of those modifications of\nRudra which are variously named, and which, being praised in them, severally\nabstain from harming them: ### Vayu P. The Bhagavata, III. 12, has a different\nscheme, as usual; but it confounds the notion of the eleven Rudras, to whom\nthe text subsequently adverts, with that of the eight here specified. These\neleven it terms Manyu, Manu, Mahinasa, Mahan, Siva, Ritadhwaja, Ugraretas,\nBhava, Kala, Vamadeva, and Dhritavrata: their wives are, Dhi, Dhriti,\nRasaloma, Niyut, Sarpi, Ila, Ambika, Iravati, Swadha, Diksha, Rudrani: and\ntheir places are, the heart, senses, breath, ether, air, fire, water, earth,\nsun, moon, and tapas, or ascetic devotion. The same allegory or mystification\ncharacterises both accounts.\n\n[59:5](vp042.htm#fr_218) See the story of Daksha\'s sacrifice at the end of the\nchapter.\n\n[59:6](vp042.htm#fr_219) The story of Uma\'s birth and marriage occurs in the\n\xc5\x9aiva P. and in the Ka\xc5\x9bi Khanda of the Skanda P.: it is noticed briefly, and\nwith some variation from the Puran\xcc\x81as, in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, first book: it is\nalso given in detail in the Kumara Sambhava of Kalidasa.\n\n[59:7](vp042.htm#fr_220) The family of Bhrigu is more particularly described\nin the tenth chapter: it is here mentioned merely to introduce the story of\nthe birth of the goddess of prosperity, \xc5\x9ari.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sacrifice of Daksha (From the Vayu Puran\xcc\x81a)](vp043.htm)\n\n'
