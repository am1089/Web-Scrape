Narada said :-- O Bhagavan! O Thou, the Eternal One! O Naraya _n_ a! O\nLord of the past and the future! Thou art the Creator and the Lord of all the\nbeings that lived in the past and that will come into existence in the future.\nThou hast described to me the highly wonderful and excellent anecdote of the\nExalted Devi. How She did assume the forms of Mahakali, Maha Lak _s_ mi, Maha\nSarasvati and Bhramari, for the fulfilment of the Devas\' purposes and how the\nDevas got back their possessions by the Grace of the Devi. All you have\ndescribed. O Lord! Now I want to hear the rules of Sadachara (right way of\nliving), the due observance of which by the devotees pleases the World-Mother.\nKindly describe them.\n\n\n\nNaraya _n_ a said :-- O Knower of Truth! Now I am telling you those rules of\nthe right way of living, which rightly observed, always please Bhagavati.\nListen first, I will talk of the Brahmi _n_ s, how their welfare is secured,\nwhat the Brahma _n_ as ought to do on getting up early in the morning from\ntheir bed. From the sunrise to the sunset the Brahma _n_ as should do all the\ndaily and occasional duties (Nitya and Naimittik Karmas) and they are to\nperform the optional works for some particular object such as Puttre _st_ i\nYaj\xc3\xb1a and other good works (not acts of black magic as killing, causing pain\nand inconveniences to others, etc.). It is the Self alone and not the Father,\nMother, etc., nor any other body that, helps us on our way to that happiness\nin the next world. Father, Mother, wife, sons and others are helps merely to\nour happiness in this world. None of them are helpful to us in bettering our\nstates in the next world.\n\n\n\nDeliverance of one\'s Self depends verily on his own Self. Therefore one should\nalways earn and store dharma (religion) and observe always there the right\nconduct to help one in the next world. If Dharma be on our side, this endless\nsea of troubles can be safely crossed. The rules of right living as ordained\nby Manu in S\xc2\x92rutis and Manu Smritis are the principal Dharmas. The Brahma _n_\nas should always be observant to their Dharma as ordained in the S\xc2\x92astras,\nS\xc2\x92ruti and Smriti. Follow the right conduct and then you will get life,\nposterity and increase of happiness easily here and hereafter. By right\nconduct, food is obtained and sins are easily destroyed; the right conduct is\nthe auspicious principal\n\n\n\np. 1055\n\n\n\nDharma of men. Persons of right living enjoy happiness in this world as well\nas in the next. Those, who are veiled in darkness by Ignorance and thus wildly\nenchanted, can verily see their way to Mukti if they follow the Great Light\nrevealed to them by Dharma and the right conduct. It is by Sadachara, that\nsuperiority is attained. Men of right conduct always do good deeds. From good\ndeeds, knowledge comes. This is the advice of Manu.\n\n\n\n14-24. Right way of living is the best of all the Dharmas and is great Tapasya\n(asceticism). The knowledge comes from this Right Living. Everything is\nattained thereby. He who is devoid of Sadachara, is like a S\xc2\x92udra, even if he\ncomes of a Brahmi _n_ family. There is no distinction whatsoever betwen him\nand a S\xc2\x92udra. Right conduct is of two kinds :-- (1) as dictated by the\nS\xc2\x92astras, (2) as dictated by the popular custom (Laukika). Both these methods\nshould be observed by him who wants welfare for his Self. He is not to forsake\none of them. O Muni! The village Dharma, the Dharma of one\'s own caste, the\nDharma of one\'s own family and the Dharma of one\'s own country all should be\nobserved by men. Never, never he is to do anything otherwise. With great\nloving devotion that is to be preserved. Men who practise wrong ways of\nliving, are censured by the public; they always suffer from diseases. Avoid\nwealth and desires that have no Dharma in them. Why? If in the name of dharma,\npainful acts (e. g. killing animals in sacrifices) are to be committed, those\nare blamed by the people; so never commit them. Avoid them by all means.\nNarada said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! The S\xc2\x92astras are not one, they are many and they lay\ndown different rules and contradictory opinions, How then Dharma is to be\nfollowed? And according what Dharma S\xc2\x92astra?\xc2\x94 Naraya _n_ a said :-- S\xc2\x92ruti and\nSmriti are the two eyes of God; the Pura _n_ am is His Heart. Whatever is\nstated in S\xc2\x92ruti, the Smriti and the Pura _n_ ams is Dharma; whatever else is\nwritten in other S\xc2\x92astras is not Dharma. Where you will find differences\nbetween S\xc2\x92ruti, Smriti and Pura _n_ as, accept the words of the S\xc2\x92rutis as\nfinal proofs. Wherever Smriti disagrees with the Pura _n_ as, know the Smritis\nmore authoritative.\n\n\n\nAnd where differences will crop up in the S\xc2\x92rutis themselves, know that\nDharma, too, is of two kinds. And where the differences will crop up in the\nSmritis themselves, consider, then, that different things are aimed at. In\nsome Pura _n_ as, the Dharma of the Tantras is duly described; but of these,\nwhich go against the Vedas, they are not to be accepted any means.\n\n\n\np. 1056\n\n\n\n25-37. Tantra is accepted as the authoritative proof then and then only when\nit contradicts not the Vedas. Whatever goes clearly against the Vedas can in\nno way be accepted as a proof. In matters concerning Dharma, the Vedas is the\nSole Proof. Therefore that which is not against the Vedas can be taken as\nproof; otherwise not. Whoever acts Dharma according to other proofs than what\nis ordained in the Vedas, goes to the hell in the abode of Yama to get his\nlesson. So the Dharma that is by all means to be accepted as such, is what is\nstated in the Vedas. The Smritis, the Pura _n_ as, or the Tantra S\xc2\x92astras can\nbe taken also as authoritative when they are not conflicting to Vedas. Any\nother S\xc2\x92astras can be taken as authoritative when it is fundamentally\ncoincident with the Vedas. Else it can never be accepted.\n\n\n\nThose who do injury to others even by the blade of a Kus\'a grass used as a\nweapon, go to hell with their heads downwards and their feet upwards. Those\nthat follow their own sweet free will, that take up any sort of dress (e. g.\nBauddhas), those that follow the philosophical doctrines called Pas\'upatas,\nand the other hermits and saints and persons that take up other vows contrary\nto the religions of the Vedas, for example, the Vaikhanasa followers, those\nwho brand their bodies by the hot Mudras, at the places of pilgrimages, e. g.\nDvarka, etc., they go to hell with their bodies scorched by red hot brands\n(Tapta Mudras). So persons should act according to the excellent religions\ncommanded by the Vedas. Everyday he should get up from his bed early in the\nmorning and think thus :-- \xc2\x93What good acts have I done, what have I given as\ncharities? Or what I advised others to do charities what greater sins\n(Mahapatakas) and what smaller sins have I committed?\xc2\x94 At the last quarter of\nthe night he should think of Para Brahma. He should place his right leg on his\nleft thigh and his left on his right thigh crosswise keeping his head straight\nup and touching the breast with his chin, and closing his eyes, he should sit\nsteadily so that the upper teeth should not touch the lower jaw.\n\n\n\nHe should join his tongue with his palate and he should sit quiet, restraining\nhis senses. He should be S\xc2\x92uddha Sattva. His seat should not be very low.\nFirst of all he should practice Pra _n_ ayama twice or thrice; and within his\nheart he should meditate the Self of the shape of the Holy Flame or the Holy\nLight. (Om Mani Padma Hum.)\n\n\n\n38-49. He should fix his heart for a certain time to that Luminous Self whose\nEyes are everywhere. So the intelligent man should practise Dhara _n_ a. Pra\n_n_ ayama is of six kinds :-- (1) Sadhuma (when the breaths are not steady),\n(2) Nirdhuma(better than the Sadhuma),\n\n\n\np. 1057\n\n\n\n(3) Sagarbha (when united with one\'s mantra), (4) Agarbha (when the practice\nis without the thought of any mantra), (5) Salak _s_ ya (when the heart is\nfixed on one\'s Deity) and (6) Alak _s_ ya (when the heart is not fixed on\none\'s Deity). No yoga can be compared with Pra _n_ ayama. This is equal to\nitself. Nothing can be its equal. This Pra _n_ ayama is of three kinds, called\nRechaka, Puraka and Kumbhaka. The Pranayama consists of three letters, A, U,\nM, i. e. of the nature of \xc2\x93Om\xc2\x94. Or, in other words the letter A, of the Pra\n_n_ ava Om indicates Puraka, the letter \xc2\x93U\xc2\x94 denotes Kumhhaka and the letter\n\xc2\x93M\xc2\x94 denotes Rechaka. By the \xc3\x8e _d_ a Na _d_ i (by the left nostril) inhale as\nlong as you count \xc2\x93A\xc2\x94 (Vi _sn_ u) thirty-two times; then withold breath, i.e.,\ndo Kumbhaka as long as you count \xc2\x93U\xc2\x94 (S\xc2\x92iva) sixtyfour times and by the\nPingala Na _d_ i (the right nostril) do the Rechaka, i.e., exhale the breath\nas long as you count \xc2\x93M" (Brahma) for sixteen times. O Muni! Thus I have\nspoken to you of the Sadhuma Pra _n_ ayama. After doing the Pra _n_ ayama as\nstated above, pierce the Six Chakras (i. e., plexuses) (called _S_ a _t_ hakra\nbheda) and carry the Kula Ku _nd_ alini to the Brahma Randhra, the brain\naperture, or to the thousand petalled lotus in the head and meditate in the\nheart the Self like a Steady Flame. (The Na _d_ is are not those which are\nknown to the Vaidya or the Medical S\xc2\x92astras. The latter are the gross physical\nnerves, The Na _d_ is here are the Yoga Na _d_ is, the subtle channels\n(Vivaras) along which the Pra _n_ ik currents flow. Now the process of\npiercing the six Chakras (or nerve centres or centres of moving Pranik forces)\nis being described. Within this body, the six nerve centres called Padmas\n(Lotuses) exist. They are respectively situated at the (1) Muladhara (half way\nbetween Anus and Linga Mula), called the Sacral Plexus; (2) Linga Mula (the\nroot of the genital organs); called postatic plexus; (this is also called\nSvadhi _st_ hana) (3) Navel, the Solar Plexus (4) Heart, the cardiac Plexus,\n(5) Throat (6) Forehead, between the eye brows there; the lotus in the\nforehead, called the cavernous plexus (\xc3\x82jna Chakra) has two petals; in these\ntwo petals, the two letters \xc2\x93Ham\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93K _s_ am\xc2\x94 exist in the right hand direction\n(with the bands of the watch; going round from left to right keeping the right\nside towards one circumambulated as as a mark of respect). I bow down to these\nwhich are the two-lettered Brahma. The lotus that exists in the throat\nlaryngeal or pharyngeal plexus has sixteen petals (vis\xc2\x92uddha chakra); in these\nare in due order in right hand direction the sixteen letters (vowels) a, a, i,\ni, u, u, _r_ i, _r_ i, lri, lri, e, ai, o, au, am, a _h_ ; I bow down to these\nwhich are the sixteen lettered Brahma. The lotus that exists in the heart, the\ncardiac plexus (anahata chakra), has twelve petals; wherein are the twelve\nletters k, kh, g, gh, n, ch, chh, j, jh, \xc3\xb1, _t_ , _t_ h; I bow to to these\ntwelve lettered Brahma. The Solar\n\n\n\np. 1058\n\n\n\nplexus forms the Great Junction of the Right and Left sympathetic chains \xc3\x8e _d_\na and Pingala with the Cerebro spinal Axis. The lotus that exists in the\nnavel, called the Solar Plexus, or Epigastric plexus (Ma _n_ ipura Chakra) has\nten petals wherein are the ten letters _d_ , _d_ h, _n_ , t, th, d, dh, n, p,\nph, counting in the right hand direction (that is clockwise) (and the action\nof this clock is vertical in the plane of the spinal cord; also it may be\nhorizontal). The lotus that exists at the root of the genital organ, the\ngenital plexus or postatic plexus has six petals. The petals are the\nconfigurations made by the position of Na _d_ is at any particular centre.\nSvadhi _st_ hana chakra or Svayambhu Linga, wherein are situated the six\nletters, b, bh, m, y, r, l; I bow down to this six-lettered Brahma. (These are\nthe Laya Centres). The lotus that exists in the Muladhara, called the sacral\nor sacrococcygeal plexus has four petals, wherein are the four letters v, s\',\n_s_ , s. I bow down to these four-lettered Brahma. In the above six nerve\ncentres or Laya Centres, or lotuses, all the letters are situated in the right\nhand direction (clockwise). (Note :-- All the nerves of the body combine\nthemselves in these six nerve centres or Laya Centres. Each of these centres\nis spheroidal and is of the Fourth Dimension. At each centre many transitions\ntake place, many visions take place, many forces are perceived and wonderful\nvarieties of knowledge are experienced. These are called the Laya Centres. For\nmany things vanish into non-existence and many new Tattvas are experienced.)\nThus meditating on the Six Chakras or plexuses, meditate on the Kula Ku _nd_\nalini, the Serpent Fire. She resides on the four petalled lotus (Centre of\nS\xc2\x92akti) called Muladhara Chakra (Coccygeal plexus); She is of Rajo Gu _n_ a;\nShe is of a blood red colour, and She is expressed by the mantra \xc2\x93Hrim,\xc2\x94 which\nis the Mayavija; she is subtle as the thread of the fibrous stock of the water\nlily. The Sun is Her face; Fire is Her breasts; he attains Jivan mukti\n(liberation while living) within whose heart such a Kula Ku _nd_ alini arises\nand awakens even once. Thus meditating on Kula Ku _nd_ alini, one should pray\nto Her :-- Her sitting, coming, going, remaining, the thought on Her, the\nrealisation of Her and chanting hymns to Her, etc., all are Mine, Who is of\nthe nature of all in all; I am that Bhagavati; O Bhagavati! All my acts are\nThy worship; I am the Devi; I am Brahma, I am free from sorrow. I am of the\nnature of Everlasting Existence, Intelligence and Bliss. Thus one should\nmeditate of one\'s own-self. I take refuge of that Kula Ku _nd_ alini, who\nappears like lightning and who holds the current thereof, when going to\nBrahmarandhra, in the brain, who appears like nectar when coming back from the\nbrain to the Muladhara and who travels in the Su _s_ umna Nadi in the spinal\ncord. Then one is to meditate on one\'s own Guru, who is thought of as one with\nGod, as seated\n\n\n\np. 1059\n\n\n\nin one\'s brain and then worship Him mentally. Then the Sadhaka, controlling\nhimself is to recite the following Mantra \xc2\x93The Guru is Brahma, the Guru is Vi\n_sn_ u, it is the Guru again that is the Deva Mahes\'vara; it is Guru that is\nPara Brahma. I bow down to that S\xc2\x92ri Guru.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the First Chapter of the Eleventh Book on what is to be thought of\nin the morning in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk11ch02.htm)\n\n'
