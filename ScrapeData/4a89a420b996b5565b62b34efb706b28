And the ideas of \xc3\x82ditya and the rest on the member; on account of this\nbeing rational.\n\n'He who shines up there let a man meditate on him as the Udgitha' ( _Kh_. Up.\nI, 3, 1).--With regard to this and similar meditations connected with\nsubordinate parts of sacrificial performances there arises the doubt whether\n\np. 720\n\nthe idea of \xc3\x82ditya and so on has to be superimposed on the subordinate part of\nthe sacrifice, such as the Udgitha, or vice versa (i.e. whether \xc3\x82ditya should\nbe meditated upon under the aspect of the Udgitha, or vice versa).--The\nPurvapakshin holds the former view. For the general principle is that the\nlower being should be viewed under the aspect of the higher, and the Udgitha\nand so on, which are parts of the sacrifices through which certain results are\neffected, are superior to the divinities who do not accomplish any result.--Of\nthis view the Sutra disposes. The ideas of \xc3\x82ditya and so on are to be\nsuperimposed on the 'members,' i.e. the Udgitha and so on, which are\nconstituent members of the sacrifices; because of the gods only superiority\ncan be established. For it is only through the propitiation of the gods that\nsacrifices are capable of bringing about their results. The Udgitha and the\nrest therefore are to be viewed under the aspect of \xc3\x82ditya and so on.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the ideas of \xc3\x82ditya and so on.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7.
