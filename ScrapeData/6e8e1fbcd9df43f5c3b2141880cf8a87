Charm against serpents, invoking the horse of Pedu that slays\nserpents.\n\n1\\. To Indra belongs the first chariot, to the gods the second chariot, to\nVaruna, forsooth, the third. The serpents' chariot is the last: it shall hit a\npost, and come to grief!  \n2\\. The young darbha-grass burns (the serpents?), the tail of the horse, the\ntail of the shaggy one, the seat of the wagon (burns the serpents?).  \n3\\. Strike down, O white (horse), with thy forefoot and thy hind-foot! As\ntimber floating in water, the poison of the serpents, the fierce fluid, is\ndevoid of strength.  \n4\\. Neighing loudly he dived down, and, again diving up, said: 'As timber\nfloating in water, the poison of the serpents, the fierce fluid, is devoid of\nstrength.'  \n5\\. The horse of Pedu slays the kasarnila, the horse of Pedu slays the white\n(serpent), and also the black. The horse of Pedu cleaves the head of the\nratharvi, the adder.  \n6\\. O horse of Pedu, go thou first: we come after thee! Thou shalt cast out\nthe serpents from the road upon which we come!  \n7\\. Here the horse of Pedu was born; from here is his departure. Here are the\ntracks of the serpent-killing, powerful steed!  \n8\\. May the closed (serpent's jaw) not snap open, may the open one not close!\nThe two serpents in this field, man and wife, they are both bereft of\nstrength.  \n9\\. Without strength here are the serpents, those that are near, and those\nthat are far. With a club do I slay the vriskika (scorpion), with a staff the\nserpent that has approached.  \n10\\. Here is the remedy for both the aghasva and the svaga! Indra (and) Pedu's\nhorse have put to naught the evil-planning (aghayantam) serpent.  \n11\\. The horse of Pedu do we remember, the strong, with strong footing: behind\nhe, staring forth, these adders.  \n12\\. Deprived are they of life's spirit, deprived of poison, slain by Indra\nwith his bolt. Indra hath slain them: we have slain them.  \n13\\. Slain are they that are striped across, crushed are the adders! Slay thou\nthe one that produces a hood, (slay) the white and the black in the darbha-\ngrass!  \n14\\. The maiden of the Kirata-tribe, the little one digs up the remedy, with\ngolden spades, on the mountain's back.  \n15\\. Hither has come a youthful physician: he slays the speckled (serpent), is\nirresistible. He, forsooth, crushes the svaga and the vriskika both.  \n16\\. Indra did set at naught for me the serpent, (and so did) Mitra and\nVaruna, Vata and Parganya both.  \n17\\. Indra did set at naught for me the serpent, the adder, male and female,\nthe svaga, (the serpent) that is striped across, the kasarnila, and the\ndasonasi.  \n18\\. Indra slew thy first ancestor, O serpent, and since they are crushed,\nwhat strength, forsooth, can be theirs?  \n19\\. I have gathered up their heads, as the fisherman the karvara (fish). I\nhave gone off into the river's midst, and washed out the serpent's poison.  \n20\\. The poison of all serpents the rivers shall carry off! Slain are they\nthat are striped across, crushed are the adders!  \n21\\. As skilfully I cull the fibre of the plants, as I guide the mares,\n(thus), O serpent, shall thy poison go away!  \n22\\. The poison that is in the fire, in the sun, in the earth, and in the\nplants, the kanda-poison, the kanaknaka, thy poison shall go forth, and come!  \n23\\. The serpents that are sprung from the fire, that are sprung from the\nplants, that are sprung from the water, and originate from the lightning; they\nfrom whom great brood has sprung in many ways, those serpents do we revere\nwith obeisance.  \n24\\. Thou art, (O plant), a maiden, Taudi by name.; Ghritaki, forsooth, is thy\nname. Underfoot is thy place: I take in hand what destroys the poison.  \n25\\. From every limb make the poison start; shut it out from the heart! Now\nthe force that is in thy poison shall go down below!  \n26\\. The poison has gone to a distance: he has shut it out; he has fused the\npoison with poison. Agni has put away the poison of the serpent, Soma has led\nit out. The poison has gone back to the biter. The serpent is dead!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 2. Prayer to Bhava and Sarva for protection from\ndangers](av182.htm)\n\n"
