Charm to remove evil bodily characteristics from a woman.\n\n1\\. The (foul) mark, the lalami (with spot on the forehead), the Arati\n(grudging demon), do we drive out. Then the (signs) that are auspicious (shall\nremain) with us; (yet) to beget offspring do we bring the Arati!  \n2\\. May Savitar drive out uncouthness from her feet, may Varuna, Mitra, and\nAryaman (drive it) out from her hands; may Anumati kindly drive it out for us!\nFor happiness the gods have created this woman.  \n3\\. The fierceness that is in thyself, in thy body, or in thy look, all that\ndo we strike away with our charm. May god Savitar prosper thee!  \n4\\. The goat-footed, the bull-toothed, her who scares the cattle, the snorting\none, the vilidhi (the driveling one), the lalami (with spot on the forehead),\nthese do we drive from us.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 110.
