Not from the mention of the number even, on account of the diversity and\nof the excess.\n\nThe Va _g_ asaneyins read in their text \'He in whom the five "five-people" and\nthe ether rest, him alone I believe to be the Self; I, who know, believe him\nto be Brahman\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 17). The doubt here arises whether this\ntext be meant to set forth the categories as established in Kapila\'s doctrine,\nor not.--The Purvapakshin maintains the former view, on the ground that the\nword \'five-people,\' qualified by the word \'five,\' intimates the twenty-five\ncategories of the Sa _n_ khyas. The compound \'five-people\' (pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _g_ ana\n_h_ ) denotes groups of five beings, just as the term pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a-pulya _h_\ndenotes aggregates of five bundles of grass. And as we want to know how many\nsuch groups there are, the additional qualification \'five\' intimates that\nthere are five such groups; just as if it were said \'five five-bundles, i. e.\nfive aggregates consisting of five bundles each.\' We thus understand that the\n\'five five-people\' are twenty-five things, and as the mantra in which the term\nis met with refers to final release, we recognise the twenty-five categories\nknown from the Sa _n_ khya-sm _ri_ ti which are here referred to as objects to\nbe known by persons desirous of release. For the followers of Kapila teach\nthat \'there is the fundamental causal substance which is not an effect. There\nare seven things, viz. the Mahat, and so on, which are causal substances as\nwell as effects. There are sixteen effects. The soul is neither a causal\nsubstance nor an effect\' (Sa _n_. Ka. 3). The mantra therefore is meant to\nintimate the categories known from the Sa _n_ khya.--To this the Sutra replies\nthat from the mention of the number twenty-five supposed to be implied in the\nexpression \'the five five-people,\' it does not follow that the categories of\nthe Sa _n_ khyas are meant. \'On account of the diversity,\' i.e. on account of\nthe five-people further qualified by the number five being different from the\ncategories of the Sa _n_ khyas. For in the text \'in whom the five five-people\nand the ether rest,\' the \'in whom\' shows the five-people to have their abode,\nand hence their Self, in Brahman; and\n\np. 372\n\nin the continuation of the text, \'him I believe the Self,\' the \'him\'\nconnecting itself with the preceding \'in whom\' is recognised to be Brahman.\nThe five five-people must therefore be different from the categories of the Sa\n_n_ khya-system. \'And on account of the excess.\' Moreover there is, in the\ntext under discussion, an excess over and above the Sa _n_ khya categories,\nconsisting in the Self denoted by the relative pronoun \'in whom,\' and in the\nspecially mentioned Ether. What the text designates therefore is the Supreme\nPerson who is the Universal Lord in whom all things abide--such as he is\ndescribed in the text quoted above, \'Therefore some call him the twenty-sixth,\nand others the twenty-seventh.\' The \'even\' in the Sutra is meant to intimate\nthat the \'five five-people\' can in no way mean the twenty-five categories,\nsince there is no pentad of groups consisting of five each. For in the case of\nthe categories of the Sa _n_ khyas there are no generic characteristics or the\nlike which could determine the arrangement of those categories in fives. Nor\nmust it be urged against this that there is a determining reason for such an\narrangement in so far as the tattvas of the Sa _n_ khyas form natural groups\ncomprising firstly, the five organs of action; secondly, the five sense-\norgans; thirdly, the five gross elements; fourthly, the subtle parts of those\nelements; and fifthly, the five remaining tattvas; for as the text under\ndiscussion mentions the ether by itself, the possibility of a group consisting\nof the five gross elements is precluded. We cannot therefore take the compound\n\'five people\' as denoting a group consisting of five constituent members, but,\nin agreement with Pa _n_. II, 1, 50, as merely being a special name. There are\ncertain beings the special name of which is \'five-people,\' and of these beings\nthe additional word \'pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ a\' predicates that they are five in number. The\nexpression is thus analogous to the term \'the seven seven- _ri_ shis\'(where\nthe term \'seven- _ri_ shis\' is to be understood as the name of a certain class\nof _ri_ shis only).--Who then are the beings called \'five-people?\'--To this\nquestion the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 12.
