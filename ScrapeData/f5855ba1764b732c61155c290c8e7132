 \nAnd he shall take her and depart  \nTo his own town with joyous heart.  \nThe maiden home in triumph led,  \nTo Rishyas'ring the king shall wed.  \nAnd he with loving joy and pride  \nShall take her for his honoured bride.  \nAnd Das'aratha to a rite  \nThat best of Brahmans shall invite  \nWith supplicating prayer,  \nTo celebrate the sacrifice  \nTo win him sons and Paradise,  1  \nThat he will fain prepare.  \n\np. 19  \n\nFrom him the lord of men at length  \n   The boon he seeks shall gain,  \nAnd see four sons of boundless strength  \n   His royal line maintain.'  \n'Thus did the godlike saint of old  \n   The will of fate declare,  \nAnd all that should befall unfold  \n   Amid the sages there.  \nO Prince supreme of men, go thou,  \n   Consult thy holy guide,  \nAnd win, to aid thee in thy vow,  \n   This Brahman to thy side.'  \nSumantra's counsel, wise and good,  \n   King Das'aratha heard,  \nThen by Vas'ishtha's side he stood  \n   And thus with him conferred:  \n'Sumantra counsels thus: do thou  \nMy priestly guide, the plan allow.'  \n   Vas'ishtha gave his glad consent,  \nAnd forth the happy monarch went  \nWith lords and servants on the road  \nThat led to Rishyas'ring's abode.  \nForests and rivers duly past,  \nHe reached the distant town at last  \nOf Lomapad the Angas' king,  \nAnd entered it with welcoming.  \nOn through the crowded streets he came,  \nAnd, radiant as the kindled flame,  \nHe saw within the monarch's house  \nThe hermit's son most glorious.  \nThere Lomapad, with joyful breast,  \n   To him all honour paid,  \nFor friendship for his royal guest  \n   His faithful bosom swayed.  \nThus entertained with utmost care  \nSeven days, or eight, he tarried there,  \nAnd then that best men thus broke  \nHis purpose to the king, and spoke:  \n'O King of men, mine ancient friend,  \n   (Thus Das'aratha prayed)  \nThy S'anta with her husband send  \n   My sacrifice to aid.  \nSaid he who ruled the Angas, Yea,  \n   And his consent was won:  \nAnd then at once he turned away  \n   To warn the hermit's son.  \nHe told him of their ties beyond  \nTheir old affection's faithful bond:  \n'This king,' he said, 'from days of old  \nA well beloved friend I hold.  \nTo me this pearl of dames he gave  \nFrom childless woe mine age to save,  \nThe daughter whom he loved so much,  \nMoved by compassion's gentle touch.  \nIn him thy S'anta's father see:  \nAs I am even so is he.  \nFor sons the childless monarch yearns:  \nTo thee alone for help he turns.  \nGo thou, the sacred rite ordain  \nTo win the sons he prays to gain:  \nGo, with thy wife thy succour lend,  \nAnd give his vows a blissful end.'  \n   The hermit's son with quick accord  \nObeyed the Angas' mighty lord,  \nAnd with fair S'anta at his side  \nTo Das'aratha's city hied.  \nEach king, with suppliant hands upheld,  \n   Gazed on the other's face:  \nAnd then by mutual love impelled  \n   Met in a close embrace.  \nThen Das'aratha's thoughtful care,  \n   Before he parted thence,  \nBade trusty servants homeward bear  \n   The glad intelligence:  \n'Let all the town be bright and gay  \n   With burning incense sweet;  \nLet banners wave, and water lay  \n   The dust in every street,'  \nGlad were the citizens to learn  \nThe tidings of their lord's return,  \nAnd through the city every man  \nObedienly his task began.  \nAnd fair and bright Ayodhya showed,  \nAs following his guest he rode  \nThrough the full streets where shell and drum  \nProclaimed aloud the king was come.  \nAnd all the people with delight  \n   Kept gazing on their king,  \nAttended by that youth so bright,  \n   The glorious Rishyas'ring.  \nWhen to his home the king had brought  \n   The hermit's saintly son,  \nHe deemed that all his task was wrought,  \n   And all he prayed for won.  \nAnd lords who saw that stranger dame  \n   So beautiful to view,  \nRejoiced within their hearts, and came  \n   And paid her honour too.  \nThere Rishyasring passed blissful days,  \nGraced like the king with love and praise  \nAnd shone in glorious light with her,  \nSweet S'anta, for his minister,  \nAs Brahma's son Vas'ishtha, he  \nWho wedded Saint Arundhati.
