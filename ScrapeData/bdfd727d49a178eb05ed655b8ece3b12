I, Vibhishan all  \nHave sorrowed fearing for thy fall.  \nO do not--for us all I speak--  \nThese desperate adventures seek,  \n'I could not,' cried Sugriva, 'brook  \nUpon the giant king to look,  \n\np. 458  \n\nNor challenge to the deadly strife  \nThe fiend who robbed thee of thy wife.'  \n'Now Lakshman, marshal,' Rama cried,  \n'Our legions where the woods are wide,  \nAnd stand we ready to oppose  \nThe fury of our giant foes.  \nThis day our armies shall ascend  \nThe walls which Ravan's powers defend,  \nAnd floods of Rakshas blood shall stain  \nThe streets encumbered with the slain.'  \nDown from the peak he came, and viewed  \nThe Vanars' ordered multitude.  \nEach captain there for battle burned,  \nEach fiery eye to Lanka turned.  \nOn, where the royal brothers led  \nTo Lanka's walls the legions sped.  \nThe northern gate, where giant foes  \nSwarmed round their monarch, Rama chose  \nWhere he in person might direct  \nThe battle, and his troops protect.  \nWhat arm but his the post might keep  \nWhere, strong as he who sways the deep,  1  \nMid thousands armed with bow and mace,  \nStood Ravan mightiest of his race?  \nThe eastern gate was Nila's post.  \nWhere marshalled stood his Vanar host,  \nAnd Mainda with his troops arrayed,  \nAnd Dwivid stood to lend him aid.  \nThe southern gate was Angad's care,  \nWho ranged his bold battalions there.  \nHanuman by the port that faced  \nThe setting sun his legions placed,  \nAnd King Sugriva held the wood  \nEast of the gate where Ravan stood.  \nOn every side the myriads met,  \nAnd Lanka's walls of close beset  \nThat scarce the roving gale could win  \nA passage to the hosts within.  \nLoud as the angry ocean's roar  \nWhen wild waves lash the rocky shore,  \nTen thousand thousand throats upsent  \nA shout that tore the firmament,  \nAnd Lanka with each grove and brook  \nAnd tower and wall and rampart shook.  \nThe giants heard, and were appalled:  \nThen Raghu's son to Angad called,  \nAnd, led by kingly duty,  2 gave  \nThis order merciful as brave:  \n'Go, Angad, Ravan's presence seek,  \nAnd thus my words of warning speak:  \n'How art thou changed and fallen now,  \nO Monarch of the giants, thou  \nWhose impious fury would not spare  \nSaint, nymph, or spirit of the air;  \nWhose foot in haughty triumph trod  \nOn Yaksha, king, and Serpent God:  \n\nHow art thou fallen from thy pride  \nWhich Brahma's favour fortified!  \nWith myriads at thy Lanka's gate  \nI stand my righteous ire to sate,  \nAnd punish thee with sword and flame,  \nThe tyrant fiend who stole my dame.  \nNow show the might, employ the guile,  \nO Monarch of the giants' isle,  \nWhich stole a helpless dame away:  \nCall up thy power and strength to-day.  \nOnce more I warn thee, Rakshas King,  \nThis hour the Maithil lady bring,  \nAnd, yielding while there yet is time,  \nSeek, suppliant, pardon for the crime,  \nOr I will leave beneath the sun  \nNo living Rakshas, no, not one.  \nIn vain from battle wilt thou fly,  \nOr borne on pinions seek the sky;  \nThe hand of Rama shall not spare;  \nHis fiery shaft shall smite thee there.'  \n\nHe ceased: and Angad bowed his head;  \nThence like embodied flame be sped,  \nAnd lighted from his airy road  \nWithin the Rakshas king's abode.  \nThere sate, the centre of a ring  \nOf counsellors, the giant king.  \nSwift through the circle Angad pressed,  \nAnd spoke with fury in his breast:  \n'Sent by the lord of Kosal's land,  \nHis envoy here, O King, I stand,  \nAngad the son of Bali: fame  \nHas haply taught thine ears my name.  \nThus in the words of Rama I  \nAm come to warn thee or defy:  \nCome forth, and fighting in the van  \nDisplay the spirit of a man.  \nThis arm shall slay thee, tyrant: all  \nThy nobles, kith and kin shall fall:  \nAnd earth and heaven, from terror freed,  \nShall joy to see the oppressor bleed,  \nVibhishan, when his foe is slain,  \nAnointed king in peace shall reign.  \nOnce more I counsel thee: repent,  \nAvoid the mortal punishment,  \nWith honour due the dame restore,  \nAnd pardon for thy sin implore.'  \n\nLoud rose the king's infuriate cry:  \n'Seize, seize the Vanar, let him lie.'  \nFour of his band their lord obeyed,  \nAnd eager hands on Angad laid.  \nHe purposing his strength to show  \nGave no resistance to the foe,  \nBut swiftly round his captors cast  \nHis mighty arms and held them fast.  \nFierce shout and cry around him rang:  \nLight to the palace roof he sprang,  \nThere his detaining arms unwound.  \nAnd hurled the giants to the ground,  \nThen, smiting with a fearful stroke,  \nA turret from the roof he broke,--  \nAs when the fiery levin sent  \n\np. 459  \n\nBy Indra from the clouds has rent  \nThe proud peak of the Lord of Snow,-  \nAnd flung the stony mass below.  \nAgain with loud terrific cry  \nHe sprang exulting to the sky,  \nAnd, joyous for his errand done,  \nStood by the side of Raghu's son.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[457:1](ry439.htm#fr_958) The Rusuk * also called Palas'a, is Bruten Frondosa,\na tree that bears beautiful red crescent shaped blossoms and is deservedly a\nfavorite with poets. * ???????
