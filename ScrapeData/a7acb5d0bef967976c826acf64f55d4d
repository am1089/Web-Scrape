And if you say--as the man and the stone; thus also.\n\np. 490\n\nHere the following view might be urged. Although the soul consists of mere\nintelligence and is inactive, while the Pradhana is destitute of all power of\nthought; yet the non-sentient Pradhana may begin to act owing to the mere\nnearness of the soul. For we observe parallel instances. A man blind but\ncapable of motion may act in some way, owing to the nearness to him of some\nlame man who has no power of motion but possesses good eyesight and assists\nthe blind man with his intelligence. And through the nearness of the magnetic\nstone iron moves. In the same way the creation of the world may result from\nthe connexion of Prak _ri_ ti and the soul. As has been said, 'In order that\nthe soul may know the Pradhana and become isolated, the connexion of the two\ntakes place like that of the lame and the blind; and thence creation springs'\n(Sa _n_ khya Ka. 21). This means--to the end that the soul may experience the\nPradhana, and for the sake of the soul's emancipation, the Pradhana enters on\naction at the beginning of creation, owing to the nearness of the soul.\n\nTo this the Sutra replies 'thus also.' This means--the inability of the\nPradhana to act remains the same, in spite of these instances. The lame man is\nindeed incapable of walking, but he possesses various other powers--he can see\nthe road and give instructions regarding it; and the blind man, being an\nintelligent being, understands those instructions and directs his steps\naccordingly. The magnet again possesses the attribute of moving towards the\niron and so on. The soul on the other hand, which is absolutely inactive, is\nincapable of all such changes. As, moreover, the mere nearness of the soul to\nthe Pradhana is something eternal, it would follow that the creation also is\neternal. If, on the other hand, the soul is held to be eternally free, then\nthere can be no bondage and no release.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 6.
