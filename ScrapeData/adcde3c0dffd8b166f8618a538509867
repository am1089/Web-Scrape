(This Scripture) also shows, and it is also stated in Sm _ri_ ti.\n\nThat Brahman is a treasure as it were of all blessed qualities and free from\nall imperfections, the whole body of Vedanta-texts clearly declares: 'That\nhighest great lord of lords, that highest deity of deities'; 'He is the cause,\nthe lord of the lords of the organs, and there is of him neither parent nor\nlord '; 'There is no effect and no cause known of him, no one is seen like\nunto him or higher. His high power is revealed as manifold, as essential\naction of knowledge and strength' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 7-9); 'He who is all-\nknowing, whose brooding consists of knowledge' (Mu. I, 1,9); 'From fear of him\nthe wind blows, from fear of him the sun moves'; 'That is one bliss of\nBrahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 8); 'That from which all speech with the mind turns\naway, not having reached it, knowing the bliss of that Brahman man fears\nnothing' (Taitt. Up. II, 9); 'He who is without parts, without action,\ntranquil, without fault, without taint' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, l9).--And Sm _ri_\nti: 'He who knows me to be unborn and without a beginning, the Supreme Lord of\nthe worlds'; 'Pervading this entire universe, by one part of mine I do abide';\n'With me as supervisor Prak _ri_ ti brings forth the universe of the movable\nand the immovable, and for this reason the world does ever move round'; 'But\nanother is the Supreme Person, who is called the Supreme Spirit, who pervading\nthe three worlds supports them--the eternal Lord' (Bha. Gi. X, 3; 42; IX, 10;\nXV, 17);\n\np. 613\n\n[paragraph continues] 'The all-working, all-powerful one, rich in knowledge\nand strength, who becomes neither less nor more, who is self-dependent,\nwithout beginning, master of all; who knows neither weariness nor exhaustion,\nnor fear, wrath and desire; the blameless one, raised above all, without\nsupport, imperishable.'--As thus Brahman in whatever place it may abide has\nthe 'twofold characteristics,' the imperfections dependent on those places do\nnot touch it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18.
