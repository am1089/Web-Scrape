On account of scripture showing (certain lines of) conduct.\n\n' _G_ anaka the king of the Videhas sacrificed with a sacrifice at which many\npresents were given to the priests' (B _ri_. Up. III, 1, 1); 'Sirs, I am going\nto perform a sacrifice' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 11, 5); these and similar passages--\nwhich occur in sections that have another purport--show that those who know\nBrahman are connected with sacrificial action also. And similarly we apprehend\nfrom the fact that according to scripture Uddalaka and others taught their\nsons and so on, that they were connected with the condition of life of\nhouseholders. If mere knowledge could effect the purpose of man, why should\nthe persons mentioned have perforated works troublesome in many respects? 'If\na man would find honey in the Arka tree why should he go to the forest?'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 4](sbe38213.htm)\n\n"
