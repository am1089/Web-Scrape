Fearlessness, purity of heart, steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga;\nalmsgiving, control of the senses, Yajna, reading of the Shastras, austerity,\nuprightness; 1\n\np. 338\n\n2\\. Non-injury, truth, absence of anger, renunciation, tranquillity, absence\nof calumny, compassion to beings, un-covetousness, gentleness, modesty,\nabsence of fickleness; 2\n\n3\\. Boldness, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, absence of hatred, absence of\n\np. 339\n\npride; these belong to one born for a divine state, O descendant of Bharata.\n\n4\\. Ostentation, arrogance and self-conceit, anger as also harshness and\nignorance, belong to one who is born, O Partha, for an Asurika state. 4\n\n5\\. The divine state is deemed to make for liberation, the Asurika for\nbondage; grieve not, O Pandava, thou art born for a divine state.\n\np. 340\n\n6\\. There are two types of beings [in](errata.htm#3) this world, the divine\nand the Asurika. The divine have been described at length; hear from Me, O\nPartha, of the Asurika.\n\n7\\. The persons of Asurika nature know not what to do and what to refrain\nfrom; neither is purity found in them nor good conduct, nor truth. 7\n\np. 341\n\n8\\. They say, "The universe is without truth, without a (moral) basis, without\na God, brought about by mutual union, with lust for its cause; what else?" 8\n\n9\\. Holding this view, these ruined souls of small intellect and fierce deeds,\nrise as the enemies of the world for its destruction. 9\n\np. 342\n\n10\\. Filled with insatiable desires, full of hypocrisy, pride and arrogance,\nholding evil ideas through delusion, they work with impure resolve.\n\n11\\. Beset with immense cares ending only with death, regarding gratification\nof lust as the highest, and feeling sure that that is all; 11\n\np. 343\n\n12\\. Bound by a hundred ties of hope, given over to lust and wrath, they\nstrive to secure by unjust means hoards of wealth for sensual enjoyment.\n\n13\\. "This to-day has been gained by me; this desire I shall obtain; this is\nmine, and this wealth also shall be mine in future.\n\n14\\. "That enemy has been slain by\n\np. 344\n\nme, and others also shall I slay. I am the lord, I enjoy, I am successful,\npowerful and happy.\n\n15\\. "I am rich and well-born. Who else is equal to me? I will sacrifice, I\nwill give, I will rejoice." Thus deluded by ignorance,\n\n16\\. Bewildered by many a fancy, covered by the meshes of delusion, addicted\nto the gratification of lust, they fall down into a foul hell.\n\np. 345\n\n17\\. Self-conceited, haughty, filled with the pride and intoxication of\nwealth, they perform sacrifices in name, out of ostentation, disregarding\nordinance;\n\n18\\. Possessed of egoism, power, insolence, lust and wrath, these malignant\npeople hate Me (the Self within) in their own bodies and those of others.\n\np. 346\n\n19\\. These malicious and cruel evildoers, most degraded of men, I hurl\nperpetually into the wombs of Asuras only, in these worlds. 19\n\n20\\. Obtaining the Asurika wombs, and deluded birth after birth, not attaining\nto Me, they thus fall, O son of Kunti, into a still lower condition.\n\np. 347\n\n21\\. Triple is this gate of hell, destructive of the self,--lust, anger and\ngreed; therefore one should forsake these three. 21\n\n22\\. The man who has got beyond these three gates of darkness, O son of Kunti,\npractises what is good for himself, and thus goes to the Goal Supreme.\n\np. 348\n\n23\\. He who, setting aside the ordinance of the Shastra, acts under the\nimpulse of desire, attains not to perfection, nor happiness, nor the Goal\nSupreme. 23\n\n24\\. So let the Shastra be thy authority in ascertaining what ought to be done\nand what ought not to be done. Having known what is said in the ordinance of\nthe Shastra, thou shouldst act here. 24\n\n\n\nThe end of the Sixteenth Chapter designated: The Classification of the Divine\nand the Non-Divine Attributes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[337:1](sbg21.htm#fr_332) _Yoga_ --consists in making what has been learnt\nfrom the Shastras and the Acharya an object of one\'s own direct perception, by\nconcentration and self-control.\n\n[338:2](sbg21.htm#fr_333) _Uncovetousness:_ Unaffectedness of the senses when\nin contact with their objects.\n\n_Absence of fickleness:_ Avoidance of useless actions.-- _Sridhara_.\n\n[339:4](sbg21.htm#fr_334) _Asurika:_ demoniac.\n\n[340:7](sbg21.htm#fr_335) _What to do . . . from:_ What acts they should\nperform to achieve the end of man, nor what acts they should abstain from to\navert evil.\n\n[341:8](sbg21.htm#fr_336) _Without truth:_ As we are unreal so this universe\nis unreal, and the sacred Scriptures that declare the truth are unreal.\n\n_What else_ --but lust can be the cause of the universe?--This is the view of\nthe Lokayatikas, the materialists.\n\n[341:9](sbg21.htm#fr_337) _Small intellect_ --as it concerns itself only with\nsense-objects and cannot soar higher.\n\n[342:11](sbg21.htm#fr_338) _Cares_ --as to the means of acquiring and\npreserving the innumerable objects of desire.\n\n[346:19](sbg21.htm#fr_339) _Wombs of Asuras:_ Wombs of the most cruel beings,\nas tigers, snakes, etc.\n\n_Worlds:_ Paths of Samsara passing through many a hell.\n\n[347:21](sbg21.htm#fr_340) _Destructive of the self:_ making the self fit for\nno human end whatever.\n\n[348:23](sbg21.htm#fr_341) _Perfection:_ fitness for attaining the end of man.\n\n[348:24](sbg21.htm#fr_342) _Here:_ in this world.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Seventeenth Chapter.
