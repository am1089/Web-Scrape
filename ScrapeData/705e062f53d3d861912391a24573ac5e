Being about to build Agni (the fire-altar), he takes him up into\nhis own self; for from out of his own self he causes him to be born, and\nwherefrom one is born, suchlike he becomes. Now were he to build up Agni\nwithout taking him up into his own self, he would beget man from man, mortal\nfrom mortal, one not freed from sin from one not freed from sin; but when he\nbuilds up Agni after taking him up into his own self, he causes Agni to be\nborn from Agni, the immortal from the immortal, the sinless from the sinless.\n\n7:4:1:22\\. He takes him in (by muttering, Va _g_. S. X III, 1), 'Within me I\nfirst take Agni,' he thereby first takes Agni into his own self;--'for\nincrease of wealth, for healthy progeny, for vigorous manhood!' and hereby he\ntakes all blessings to himself;--'and may the deities stand by me!' and hereby\nhe takes all the gods to himself; and thus he takes into his own self all that\nhe is about to generate from his own self. Having taken Agni\n\np. 363\n\ninto his own self whilst standing, he builds him up sitting;--Agni is an\nanimal: hence the animal, having received the foetus standing, gives birth\nafter lying down.\n\n7:4:1:33\\. He now sings the Satya Saman 1 (true hymn). For the gods then said,\n'Let us make the truth (satya) his mouth (or beginning): thus we shall become\nthe truth, truth will turn unto us, and true will become that wish of ours for\nwhich we are about to perform this rite!'\n\n7:4:1:44\\. They sang that 'true hymn' at the outset, and thus made the truth\nhis (Agni's) mouth; and they became the truth; the truth turned unto them, and\ntrue became that wish of theirs for which they performed this rite.\n\n7:4:1:55\\. And in like manner when the Sacrificer now, at the outset, sings\nthe 'true hymn,' he thereby makes the truth his (Agni's) mouth; and he\n(himself) becomes the truth; and truth turns unto him; and true becomes that\nwish of his for which he performs this rite.\n\n7:4:1:66\\. Now that truth is the same as the waters, for the waters are the\ntruth. Hence they say, 'Whereby 2 the waters flow, that is a form of the\ntruth.' It is the waters indeed that were made first of this universe: hence\nwhen the waters (rains) flow, then everything whatsoever exists is produced\nhere.\n\n7:4:1:77\\. He then puts down a lotus-leaf (in the centre of\n\np. 364\n\nthe altar-site);--the lotus-leaf is a womb: he hereby puts a womb to it (for\nAgni to be born from).\n\n7:4:1:88\\. And, again, why he puts down a lotus-leaf;--the lotus means the\nwaters, and this earth is a leaf thereof: even as the lotus-leaf here lies\nspread on the water, so this earth lies spread on the waters. Now this same\nearth is Agni's womb, for Agni (the fire-altar) is this earth, since thereof\nthe whole Agni is built up: it is this earth he thus lays down. He lays it\ndown so as not to be separated from the truth: he thereby establishes this\nearth on the truth;--hence this earth is established on the truth; and hence\nthe truth is this earth, for this earth is the most certain of these worlds.\n\n7:4:1:99\\. [He lays it down, with Va _g_. S. XIII, 2] 'The waters' back thou\nart, the womb of Agni,' for this earth is indeed the back of the waters, and\nthe womb of Agni;--'around the swelling ocean,' for the ocean indeed swells\naround this earth;--'growing great on the lotus,' that is, 'growing, flourish\nthou on the lotus;'--'spread out with the extent, with the breadth, of the\nsky!' with this he strokes along (the leaf),--for this Agni is yonder sun, and\nno other extent but that of the sky is able to contain him: he thus says (to\nthe leaf), Having become the sky, contain him! He lays it down with a Svara\n_g_ verse, for self-rule (svara _g_ ya) belongs to the waters. Having\n'settled' it, he pronounces the Sudadohas 1 upon it: the significance of this\nhas been explained.\n\n7:4:1:1010\\. He then puts the gold plate 2 thereon. Now\n\np. 365\n\nthis gold plate is yonder sun, for he shines over all the creatures here on\nearth; and 'ro _k_ as' (shine) they mystically call 'rukma' (gold plate), for\nthe gods love the mystic: he thus lays down yonder sun (on the altar). It is\ngolden, and round, with one and twenty knobs,--the significance of this has\nbeen explained. He puts it down with the knobs pointing downward; for the\nknobs are his (the sun's) rays, and his rays (shine) downwards.\n\n7:4:1:1111\\. He puts it down on the lotus-leaf;--the lotus-leaf is a womb: in\nthe womb he thus places him (Agni).\n\n7:4:1:1212\\. And, again, why he puts it on the lotus-leaf;--the lotus-leaf is\na foundation, for the lotus-leaf is this earth, and this earth is the\nfoundation: he who is not settled on this earth, is unsettled even as one who\nis far away. Now by means of his rays that (sun) is settled on this earth: he\nthus settles him (Agni) on this earth, as his foundation.\n\n7:4:1:1313\\. And, again, why he puts it on the lotus-leaf. When Indra had\nsmitten V _ri_ tra, he, thinking that he had not laid him low, entered the\nwaters. He said to them, 'I am afraid: make ye a stronghold for me!' Now what\nessence of the waters there was that they gathered upwards (on the surface),\nand made it a stronghold for him; and because they made (kar) a stronghold (pu\n_h_ ) for him, therefore it is 'pushkara;' 'pushkara' being what is mystically\ncalled 'push-kara' (lotus-leaf), for the gods love the mystic. Now when he\nputs it (the gold plate) on the lotus-leaf, he then establishes him (Agni) in\nthat essence which the waters gathered together for him (Indra), and in that\nstronghold which they made for him.\n\n7:4:1:1414\\. [He puts it down, with Va _g_. S. XIII, 3]\n\np. 366\n\n[paragraph continues] 'The Brahman first born in front;' the Brahman doubtless\nis yonder sun, and he is born day by day in front (in the east);--'from the\nsummit 1 he, the longing, overspread the shining,' the summit doubtless is the\nmiddle, the shining ones are these worlds, and the longing one is yonder sun,\n--he is the longing one inasmuch as he longed to be born; and in rising he\noverspreads 2 these (worlds) from the summit, from the middle;--'he\n(overspread) the nighest extents of the deep,' his nighest extents of the deep\ndoubtless are the regions, for he (the sun) does extend nigh to them;--'the\nwomb of the existent and of the non-existent did he overspread!' the womb of\nthe existent and of the non-existent doubtless are these worlds; for both what\nexists and what does not exist is born from these worlds. He puts it on with a\ntrish _t_ ubh verse, for yonder (sun) is related to the Trish _t_ ubh 3.\nHaving 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sudadohas 4 verse upon it: the\nsignificance of this has been explained.\n\n7:4:1:1515\\. He then lays the (gold) man thereon,--he is Pra _g_ apati, he is\nAgni, he is the Sacrificer. He is made of gold, for gold is light, and fire is\nlight; gold is immortality, and fire is immortality. It is a man (purusha),\nfor Pra _g_ apati is the Man.\n\np. 367\n\n7:4:1:1616\\. And, again, why he lays down the man. When Pra _g_ apati was\nrelaxed, his pleasing form went out from within; when it had gone out of him,\nthe gods left him. When the gods restored him, they put that pleasing form\ninto him, and the gods were pleased with that (form) of his; and inasmuch as\nthe gods were pleased (ram) with that pleasing (ramya) form of his, it is\ncalled 'hiramya;' 'hiramya' being what is mystically called 'hira _n_ ya'\n(gold), for the gods love the mystic. And in like manner does this\n(Sacrificer) now put that pleasing form into him (Agni), and the gods are\npleased with that (form) of his. But that pleasing form of his is the vital\nair: it is that vital air he thus puts into him.\n\n7:4:1:1717\\. He lays him on the gold plate, for the gold plate is yonder sun:\nthat same man who is in that (sun's) disk, it is him he now lays down (on the\naltar).\n\n7:4:1:1818\\. He lays him down on his back 1;--for the gods at that time said,\n'If we lay down these two 2 both looking hitherwards, they will burn up\neverything here; and if (we lay) both so as to be turned away from here, they\nwill give warmth only in the opposite direction; and if facing each other,\nthen there will be light only between those two, and they will injure each\nother.' They laid down the one so as to look hitherwards, and the other so as\nto look away from here: that one (the sun), the gold disk, looking downwards,\ngives warmth by his rays, and\n\np. 368\n\nthat man (tends) upward by his vital airs 1. He lays him down (with the head)\ntowards the east, for (with the head) towards the east this Agni (the fire-\naltar) is built up.\n\n7:4:1:1919\\. [He lays him down, with Va _g_. S. XIII, 4; _Ri_ k S. X, 121, 1]\n'Hira _n_ yagarbha came first into existence,' for that golden child did come\nfirst into existence;--'born he was the one lord of being;' for he indeed was\nborn as the one lord of all this being;--'he upholdeth this earth and the\nsky,' for he (the sun) does uphold both the sky and the earth;--'to the god Ka\nlet us do homage by offering!' Ka (Who?) is Pra _g_ apati: thus, 'let us do\nhomage to Him by offering!'\n\n7:4:1:2020\\. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 5; _Ri_ k S. X, 17, 11] 'The drop leaped along\nthe earth and sky;' the drop is yonder sun, and he leaps both to the sky and\nto the earth--thus (in rising) to that (sky), and thus (in setting) to this\n(earth);--'along this seat, and that which was afore;' that is, to this world,\nand to that one; or this (\xc3\x82havaniya altar) which is now being built, and that\n(Garhapatya altar) which yonder was built before;--'(the drop) moving along\nthe common seat;' for he (the sun) moves along that common seat;--'the drop I\noffer along the seven hotras;' the drop is yonder sun; and the seven hotras\nare the regions: he thus establishes yonder sun in the regions.\n\n7:4:1:2121\\. With two (verses) he lays him down;--two-footed is the\nSacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much he thus lays him down;--with two trish _t_ ubh\n\np. 369\n\nverses, for he (the sun) is related to the Trish _t_ ubh. Having 'settled'\nhim, he pronounces the Sudadohas on him: the significance of this has been\nexplained.\n\n7:4:1:2222\\. He then sings a Saman. For the gods, having laid down that man,\nthen saw him (looking) even suchlike as yonder dry plank.\n\n7:4:1:2323\\. They said, 'Think ye upon this, how we may put vigour into this\nman!' They said, 'Meditate ye ( _k_ etay)!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to\nsay, 'Seek ye to build up ( _k_ itim ish)! seek ye how we shall put vigour\ninto this man!'\n\n7:4:1:2424\\. Whilst meditating, they saw this Saman, and sang it, and thereby\nput vigour into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby put it\ninto him: he sings on the man, he puts vigour into the man;--he sings on the\nbright one 1, for Agni is all bright things. After he has laid him down, let\nhim not walk round him in front, lest that Agni should injure him.\n\n7:4:1:2525\\. He (the Sacrificer) then stands by (the gold man) worshipping him\nwith the Sarpanama (serpent-named) formulas. The serpents doubtless are these\nworlds, for these glide along (sarp) with everything here whatsoever there is;\nand Agni is no other than the self (body) of all the gods. They, the gods,\nhaving laid down (on the altar) that self of theirs, were afraid lest these\nworlds should glide away with that self of theirs.\n\n7:4:1:2626\\. They saw those Sarpanama and worshipped with them; by these\n(verses) they stopped these worlds for him, and caused them to bend\nthemselves; and because they caused them to bend (nam) themselves,\n\np. 370\n\ntherefore (the formulas are called) Sarpanama. And in like manner does the\nSacrificer, when he stands by worshipping with the Sarpanama formulas, stop\nthese worlds for him, and cause these worlds to bend themselves; and so they\ndo not glide away with that self of his.\n\n7:4:1:2727\\. And, again, why he stands by worshipping with the Sarpanama\nformulas;--the serpents are these worlds, for whatever creeps (sarp), creeps\nin these worlds. Now when he worships with the Sarpanama formulas--whatever\nfiend there is in these worlds, whatever devourer, whatever ogress,--all that\nhe thereby appeases.\n\n7:4:1:2828\\. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 6-8] 'Homage be to the serpents, whichever are\non earth, and they that are in the air, and they that are in the sky, to those\nserpents be homage!' whatever serpents there are in these three worlds to them\nhe thereby does homage.\n\n7:4:1:2929\\. 'They that are the darts of demons,' for some (of the serpents),\nsent by demons, bite;--'and those on the trees, and those which lie in holes,\nto those serpents be homage!' he thereby does homage to the serpents that lie\nboth in trees, and in holes.\n\n7:4:1:3030\\. 'Or those that are in the luminous sphere of the sky; or those in\nthe rays of the sun; those by which abode is made in the waters, to those\nserpents be homage!' he hereby does homage to them wheresoever they are. He\ndoes so by 'homage, homage,' for homage is sacrifice (worship): by sacrifice,\nby homage, he thus worships them. Let him therefore not say 'homage be to\nthee,' to one not worthy of sacrifice, for it\n\np. 371\n\nwould be just as if he said 'sacrifice (or, worship) be to thee!'\n\n7:4:1:3131\\. With three (formulas) he worships,--three are these worlds, and\nthreefold, also, is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by\nso much he thus stops these worlds (from moving); and by so much does he\nappease everything here. Standing he worships, for these worlds stand, as it\nwere; and besides, while standing one is stronger.\n\n7:4:1:3232\\. Thereupon, having sat down he offers on (the gold man) with\nfivefold-taken ghee,--the significance of this has been explained. On each\nside (of the fire he offers), moving round: he thus gratifies him (Agni) with\nfood from all quarters.\n\n7:4:1:3333\\. And, again, why he offers thereon. The gods, having laid down\nthat body of theirs, now were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should\nsmite that (body) of theirs. They saw those Rakshas-killing counter-charms\n1,--(Va _g_. S. XIII, 9-13; _Ri_ k S. IV, 4, I-5),\n\np. 372\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Put forth thy power, like a broad army!' slayers of\nRakshas are the counter-charms: having, by means of these counter-charms,\nrepelled the Rakshas, the fiends, in every quarter, they (the gods) restored\nthat body in a place free from danger and devilry; and in like manner this\nSacrificer, having, by means of these counter-charms, repelled the Rakshas,\nthe fiends, in every quarter, now restores that body (of Agni) in a place free\nfrom danger and devilry.\n\n7:4:1:3434\\. He offers with ghee; for the ghee is a thunderbolt: by the\nthunderbolt he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends;--with fivefold-taken\n(ghee),--of five layers consists the fire-altar; five seasons are a year, and\nthe year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so\nmuch he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends;--with (five) verses addressed to\nAgni, for the Rakshas-killing light is Agni: by Agni he thus repels the\nRakshas, the fiends;--with trish _t_ ubh verses,--the Trish _t_ ubh is a\nthunderbolt: by the thunderbolt he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends. On\neach side (he offers) moving round: in every quarter he thus repels the\nRakshas, the fiends.\n\n7:4:1:3535\\. Behind the altar (he offers) while seated with his face towards\nthe east; then on the left (north) side (looking) to the south; then in front\n(looking) to the west; then going round behind, (he offers) on the right\n(south) side while sitting with his face towards the north. Thus (he moves) to\nthe right, for\n\np. 373\n\nthat (leads) to the gods. Thereupon, going back, (he offers) while sitting\nbehind, with his face towards the east; and in this way that performance of\nhis takes place towards the east 1.\n\n7:4:1:3636\\. He then lays down two offering-spoons,--the offering-spoons are\narms 2: it is his arms he thus restores to him (Agni). And as to why offering-\nspoons (are laid down), it is because the arms are offering-spoons,--that bowl\nand the handle are two, for there are two of these arms. He lays them down at\nthe (left and right) sides, for these arms (of ours) are at the sides.\n\n7:4:1:3737\\. On the right (south) side he lays down one of karshmarya (gmelina\narborea) wood. For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the\nfiends, should destroy their sacrifice from the south. They saw that Rakshas-\nkilling tree, the Karshmarya: having by that tree repelled the Rakshas, the\nfiends, on the south, they spread that sacrifice in a place free from danger\nand devilry. And in like manner the Sacrificer, having by that tree repelled\nthe Rakshas, the fiends, on the south, now spreads that sacrifice in a place\nfree from danger and devilry. It (the spoon) is filled with ghee;--the ghee is\na thunderbolt: it is by the thunderbolt he thus repels the Rakshas, the\nfiends, on the south.\n\n7:4:1:3838\\. On the left (north) side he then lays down one of udumbara (ficus\nglomerata) wood; for the Udumbara means strength, life-sap: strength, life-sap\nhe thus puts into him. It is filled with sour\n\np. 374\n\ncurds,--sour curds are life-sap: it is life-sap he thus puts into him.\n\n7:4:1:3939\\. And, again, why he lays down two offering-spoons. When Pra _g_\napati was relaxed, Agni took his (Pra _g_ apati's) fiery spirit, and carried\nit off to the south, and there stopped; and because after carrying (karsh) it\noff he stopped (ud-ram), therefore the Karshmarya (sprang up). And Indra took\nhis (Pra _g_ apati's) vigour and went away to the north: it became the\nUdumbara tree.\n\n7:4:1:4040\\. He (Pra _g_ apati) said to those two, 'Come ye to me, and put\nback into me that (substance) of mine wherewith ye have gone off!'--'Well\nthen, bestow thou all food here on us two!' they said.--'Well then, join me,\nbecoming these two arms of mine!'--'So be it!' He bestowed all food on them,\nand they joined him, becoming those two arms of his: hence it is by the arms\nthat food is made, and by means of the arms that it is eaten, for he (Pra _g_\napati) bestowed all food on the two arms.\n\n7:4:1:4141\\. The karshmarya one he lays down on the right side, with (Va _g_.\nS. XIII, 13), 'By Agni's fiery spirit I settle thee!'--that fiery spirit of\nhis (Pra _g_ apati's) which Agni then took and carried off to the south, he\nnow puts back into him.--'Agni, the head, the summit of the sky, he, the lord\nof the earth, animates the seeds of the waters,' for Agni indeed is this\n(spoon). With a Gayatri verse (he performs),--Agni is Gayatra: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays down that\n(spoon). It is filled with ghee, for ghee belongs to Agni: with his own share,\nwith his own life-sap he thus gratifies him.\n\n7:4:1:4242\\. He then lays down the udumbara one on the\n\np. 375\n\nleft (north) side, with (Va _g_. S. XIII, 14), 'By Indra's vigour I settle\nthee!' that vigour of his (Pra _g_ apati's) which Indra then took and went\naway to the north, he now puts back into him.--(Va _g_. S. XIII, 15; _Ri_ k S.\nX, 8, 6), 'Thou hast become the leader of the sacrifice, and of the sphere to\nwhich thou tendest with propitious teams; the light-giving head hast thou\nlifted to the sky; thy tongue, O Agni, hast thou made the bearer of the\noffering;'--Indra indeed is this (spoon). And as to its being a verse\naddressed to Agni, it is because it is the performance of Agni (the fire-\naltar);--and a trish _t_ ubh one, because Indra is connected with the Trish\n_t_ ubh; and Agni includes Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much he thus lays it down. Moreover, all the gods are\nIndra and Agni, and Agni belongs to all the deities: as great as Agni is, as\ngreat as is his measure, with so much he thus lays it down. It is filled with\nsour curds, for sour curds belong to Indra: with his own share, with his own\nlife-sap he thus gratifies him.\n\n7:4:1:4343\\. Indra and Agni indeed are those two arms of his (Pra _g_\napati's): they join him with fiery spirit and vigour. Where he (the\nSacrificer) touches (the ground with his arms), whilst viewing intently the\ngold man with his breast close to him 1, there he\n\np. 376\n\n[paragraph continues] (the Adhvaryu) makes a mark and lays down those\n(spoons); for that is the place of those two (arms).\n\n7:4:1:4444\\. Now some lay them down sideways (from south to north), saying,\n'Sideways run these two arms (of ours).' Let him not do so, but let him lay\nthem with the bowl towards the front (east), for this Agni (altar) is built\nwith the head towards the front; and, besides, in this way the arms are\nstronger. Separately he lays them down, separately he 'settles' them, and\nseparately he pronounces the Sudadohas verse on them; for separate are these\ntwo arms.\n\n7:4:1:4545\\. As to this they say, 'Let him make no arms to this (gold) man 1,\nlest he should cause him to be redundant; for these two spoons are (in lieu\nof) his arms.' Let him nevertheless make (him with arms), for those two spoons\nare (merely) after the manner of the two arms. Moreover, those two (arms of\nAgni) are wings; and whatever forms, whatever stomas, whatever p _ri_ sh _th_\nas, whatever metres he will be applying to that fire-altar, that will be the\nperfection, that will be the growth of those two: let him therefore make arms\nto that (gold) man.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[363:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_680) Probably Sama-v.

Put forth thy power as (if it were) a broad host (or, net); go forth, like\na mighty king with his following, following up the swift host! An archer thou\nart: pierce the Rakshas with thy fieriest (darts).\n\n2\\. Swiftly fly thy whirling (darts): fiercely burning attack thou boldly!\nUnfettered, O Agni, with thy tongue pour forth on all sides winged flames and\nfirebrands.\n\n3\\. Thou, the most rapid, send forth thy spies: be thou an undaunted protector\nto this people (from him) who planneth evil against us from afar or from near\nby; O Agni, let none dare to attack us without thy cognizance.\n\n4\\. Rise, O Agni, spread thyself out, and burn down the foes, O sharp-darted:\nwhosoever hath done us injury, burn him down, O flaming one, like dry\nbrushwood. p. 372\n\n5\\. Stand up, O Agni; strike out for our sake, and manifest thy divine powers!\nunstring the strong (arrows, or bows) of the goblins: crush the enemies, be\nthey kindred or strangers!\n\n[373:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_693) The order in which he offers would thus be,--west,\nnorth, east, (then going back along the north and west sides) south, west.\n\n[373:2](sbe4163.htm#fr_694) They are indeed of an arm's length, with bowls of\nthe shape and size of the hand, see part i, p. 67, note 2.\n\n[375:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_695) There seems to be considerable difference of\nopinion between Katyayana and Saya _n_ a regarding this point of the\nceremonial. The gold man lies stretched out on his back with his head towards\nthe east. According to Katyayana, XVII, 4, 10, he (the Sacrificer) is to lie\ndown so as to cover the gold man, but without actually touching him with his\nbreast, and at the extreme end of where the arms touch (the ground) he is to\nmake two marks, where the spoons are then to be laid down with the bowl\ntowards the east. Saya _n_ a, p. 376 on the other hand, explains--'Let the\nAdhvaryu lay down the two spoons close to the breast of the laid-down gold\nman. Having beheld (i.e. recognised)--or, whilst beholding (?)--that man,\nwhere-ever the laid-down pair of spoons reaches his breast there, having made\na mark, let him lay down the two spoons: that part of the breast doubtless is\nthe place of those two (spoons, or gods?) extolled as the arms.' Perhaps the\ntext of this comment is somewhat corrupt. The ceremony is apparently intended\nto symbolise the identification of the Sacrificer with the sacrificial man, or\nthe sacrifice itself: The Sacrificer lies down so as to rest on his forearms;\nthe spoons being afterwards laid down on the marks left by the fore-arms (and\nnaturally running in an easterly direction).--For Professor Weber's view, see\np. 367, note 1.\n\n[376:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_696) That is to say, Let it be a gold statuette without\narms.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 4, 2.
