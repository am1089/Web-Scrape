I praise Agni who has three heads and seven rays (or reins)\n[1](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:1:1), who is without flaw, sitting in the lap of his\nparents [2](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:1:2) and of whatever moves or is firm, who\nhas filled (with his light) all the lights of Heaven.\n\n2\\. The big bull has grown up to them [1](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:2:1); the\nageless one who from here (from this world) distributes his blessings, the\ntall has stood up erect. He puts down his feet on the surface of the wide\n(Earth); his red ones [2](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:2:2) lick the udder (the\ncloud?).\n\n3\\. Walking towards their common calf the two well-established\n[1](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:3:1) milch-cows [2](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:3:2) walk\nabout in different directions. They measure interminable paths; they have\ninvested themselves with all great desires.\n\n4\\. Wise poets [1](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:4:1) follow his track\n[2](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:4:2) who in manifold ways protect the ageless one\nwith their hearts. Wishing to acquire him they have searched the river\n[3](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:4:3). He the Sun [4](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:4:4)\nbecame visible to them, to the men [5](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:4:5).\n\n5\\. He is worthy to be looked for, round about in his race-courses, the noble\nwho is to be magnified [1](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:5:1), the great one\n[2](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:5:2), in order that the small may live, as he, the\nall-visible liberal lord, has become a progenitor for those germs in many\nplaces.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is Trish _t_ ubh.--No verse occurs in the other\nSa _m_ hitas.\n\np. 168\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a refers the three heads of Agni to the three Savanas, or the\nthree worlds, or the three sacrificial fires. The last explanation seems to be\nmost probable. The seven reins (rays) are, according to Saya _n_ a, the seven\nmetres or the seven flames of Agni. The last explanation is recommended by\nIII, 6, 2 (see below). But it is possible also to think of the seven priests\n(sapta hotara _h_ ).--Comp. II, 5, 2 (see below), and Taitt. Sa _m_ hita I, 5,\n3, 2 (to which passage Ludwig refers): sapta te agne samidha _h_ sapta _g_\nihva\xc2\xb4 _h_ sapta _r i_shaya _h_ sapta dha\xc2\xb4ma priya\xc2\xb4 _n_ i, &c.\n\nNote 2. The parents are Heaven and Earth.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The text has the dual feminine; no doubt Heaven and Earth are meant.\n\nNote 2. The horses or flames of Agni.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. On su-meka, comp. the article of Prof. Windisch in Festgruss an\nBohtlingk, p. 114.\n\nNote 2. The cows seem to be Night and Dawn; comp. above, I, 95, 1; 96, 5.\nNight and Dawn are called sumeke, I, 113, 3.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The priests.\n\nNote 2. I have translated padam nayanti in the way indicated by Atharva-veda\nXI, 2, 13. viddhasya padani\xc2\xb4 _h_ iva; comp. also Manu VIII, 44. Prof. Max\nMuller translates, 'Wise poets lead (Agni) to the ageless place, keeping many\nthings in their heart--or, lead the ageless Agni to his place (the\nsacrifice).'\n\nNote 3. They have tried to find Agni in his proper dwelling, in the water.\n\nNote 4. The Sun is here identified with Agni.\n\nNote 5. On the form n _r i\xc2\xb4_n standing for different cases,\n\np. 169\n\ncompare Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 430; Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, I, 136,\nnote 1; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 42, and Gottinger Gel. Anzeigen, 1890,\np. 541 seq.; Hillebrandt, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft,\nXLVIII, 420. Here it seems most natural to take n _r i\xc2\xb4_n, as Pischel has\nproposed, as standing for the dative plural. Bartholomae (Studien zur\nindogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, I, 118, comp. p. 48), referring to III, 14,\n4, believes that n _r i\xc2\xb4_n (or, more correctly, *n _r i\xc2\xb4_m), both here and\nthere is genitive plural, and that Agni is called 'the sun of men' because men\nare able to light this sun themselves. To me it seems very doubtful that this\nis a Vedic idea, and as to the verse III, 14, 4, I believe that n _r i\xc2\xb4_n\nthere is a regular accusative plural: Agni is called there, 'a sun that\nspreads out men over their dwellings.'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x8e _l_ enya _h_. Comp. I, 1, 1, note 2.\n\nNote 2. Agni may be called maha _h_ , 'the great one.' But it seems more\nnatural to read mahe, the ancient pronunciation of which word before a word\ncommencing with a vowel (maha') coincided, or nearly coincided, with that of\nmaha _h_. The translation then would be: 'he who is to be magnified in order\nthat the great and the small may live.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 147](sbe46045.htm)\n\n"
