Thereby thou shalt be inflamed and shalt grow. Inflame us and make us grow; through offspring, cattle, holy lustre, and through the enjoyment of food make us increase. Svaha!\'\n\n12\\. He then sacrifices with the (spoon called) Darvi (the following\noblations):\n\n13. 13 Approaching the Darvi (to the fire) by the northerly junction of the pegs (laid round the fire), and fixing his mind on (the formula), \'To Pra _g_ apati, to Manu svaha!\' (without pronouncing that Mantra), he sacrifices a straight, long, uninterrupted (stream of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya), directed towards the south-east.\n\n14\\.

Agni! Perceive this work (i.e. the sacrifice), as it is performed (by us). Thou art a healer, a creator of medicine. Through thee may we obtain cows, horses, and men. Svaha!\n\n\'Thou who liest down athwart, thinking, "It is I who keep (all things)\nasunder:" to thee who art propitious (to me), I sacrifice this stream of ghee\nin the fire. Svaha!\n\n\'To the propitious goddess svaha!\n\n\'To the accomplishing goddess svaha!\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[141:1](sbe30045.htm#fr_471) 2, 1.
