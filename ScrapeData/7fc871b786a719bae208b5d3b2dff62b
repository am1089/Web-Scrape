Now we shall explain the opening and the conclusion (of the annual course\nof study).\n\n2. 2 During the fortnight that precedes the _S_ rava _n_ a\n\np. 242\n\nfull moon, when the herbs have appeared, under (the Nakshatra) Hasta or on the\nfull-moon day (itself), the opening ceremony of the (annual course of) study\n(is performed).\n\n3\\. Having put wood on the fire and performed the rites down to the Vyah _ri_\nti oblations, he sacrifices (with his pupils) to the _Ri_ shis of the Ka _n_\n_d_ as: 'To Pra _g_ apati, the _Ri_ shi of a Ka _n_ _d_ a, svaha! To Soma, the\n_Ri_ shi of a Ka _n_ _d_ a, svaha! To Agni, the _Ri_ shi of a Ka _n_ _d_ a,\nsvaha! To the Vi _s_ ve devas, the _Ri_ shis of a Ka _n_ _d_ a, svaha! To\nSvayambhu, the _Ri_ shi of a Ka _n_ _d_ a, svaha!'\xc2\x97these are the _Ri_ shis of\nthe Ka _n_ _d_ as. Or (he sacrifices) to the names of the Ka _n_ _d_ as, to\nthe Savitri, to the _Ri_ g-veda, the Ya _g_ ur-veda, the Sama-veda, the\nAtharva-veda, and to Sadasaspati.\n\n4\\. Having (thus) sacrificed, they repeat the first three Anuvakas,\n\n5\\. Or the beginnings of all Ka _n_ _d_ as.\n\n6\\. He enters upon (sacrificing) the _G_ aya, &c. (oblations; see above, I, 1,\n3, 8).\n\n7\\. After all rites down to the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t oblation have been\nperformed, they stop studying three days or one day; then they should go on\nstudying so as to commence where they have broken off: so say the teachers.\n\n8. 8 During the fortnight that precedes the Taishi full moon, under (the Nakshatra) Rohi _n_ i or on the full-moon day (itself), the Utsarga (or conclusion of the term of study) is celebrated.\n\np. 243\n\n9. 9 (The teacher) with his pupils goes in an easterly or northerly direction, and where they find a pleasant water with a pleasant bathing-place, they dive into it and perform three suppressions of the breath with the Agharmarsha _n_ a hymn ( _Ri_ g-veda X, 190 = Taitt. Ar. X, 1, 13. 14.). Holding purifiers (i.e. Darbha blades) in their hands they bathe with the three (verses), 'Ye waters, ye are wholesome' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 1, 5, 1), with the four (verses), 'The gold-coloured, pure, purifying waters' (T.S.V, 6, 1, 1 seq.), and with the Anuvaka, '(Soma) which clears itself, the heavenly being' (Taitt. Br. I, 4, 8): giving the Darbha blades to each other and feigning to try to seize (??) each other.\n\n10\\. Then they arrange on a pure spot that is inclined towards the east, seats\nof eastward-pointed Darbha grass, so that they end in the north\xc2\x97\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[241:2](sbe30090.htm#fr_703) 18, 2. _S_ rava _n_ apaksha means, according to\nMat _ri_ datta, _s_ rava _n_ apurvapaksha, p. 242 and indeed the moon stands\nin conjunction with the Nakshatra Hasta only on one day of the first, not of\nthe second, fortnight of the month _S_ rava _n_ a (comp. the note on \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana-G _ri_ hya III, 5, 2. 3).
