Agni! Lead us to wealth on a good path, O god who knowest all rules. Drive\naway from us sin which leads us astray. We will offer to thee the fullest\npraise.\n\n2\\. Agni! Thou who art young, help us safely across all difficulties. Be for\nus a broad, large, wide stronghold, for our kith and kin, with luck and weal\n[1](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:2:1).\n\n3\\. Agni! Drive away from us all plagues. (Then) they shall plague\n[1](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:3:1) peoples who do not stand under Agni's\nprotection. (Give) us back again the earth, O god, together with all the\nimmortals, O worshipful one, that it may go well with us.\n\n4\\. Protect us, Agni, with thy unwearied guardians, thou who flamest in thy\nbeloved seat. May no danger, O youngest of the gods, attain thy praiser, not\nnow nor in future, O mighty one!\n\n5\\. Do not deliver us, O Agni, to the harmful foe, to the greedy one, to the\nimpostor, to misfortune. Do not surrender us, O mighty one, to one who has\nteeth, who bites, nor to one who has no teeth, nor to one who will hurt us.\n\n6\\. May a (god) like thee, O Agni, who art born according to _Ri_ ta, being\npraised spread out a shelter for the body (of the worshipper that protects)\nfrom every one who tries to harm or to revile him. For thou, O god, art a\ndescrier [1](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:6:1) of everything that leads us astray.\n\np. 182\n\n7 [1](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:7:1). Thou, O Agni, distinguishing both (kinds of\nmen, the pious and the impious, or the Aryans and the Dasyus\n[2](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:7:2)), eagerly approachest (Aryan) men at (the time\nof) the advancing (day) [3](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:7:3), O worshipful one. At\n(the time of) rest thou hast become governable to the man (or, to Manu; or,\nthou art to be praised by men [4](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:7:4)); thou art to be\nsmoothed down like a horse [5](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:7:5) by the U _s_ i _g_\ns.\n\n8\\. We have pronounced our invocations, I the son of Mana\n[1](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:8:1), before this mighty Agni. May we obtain (our\nwishes) through a thousand _Ri_ shis. May we find a food-giving \xe2\x80\xa6 rich in\nquickening rain [2](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:8:2).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 1 = VS. V, 36; VII, 43; XL,\n16; TS. I, 1, 14, 3; 4, 43, 1; TB. II, 8, 2, 3; T\xc3\x82. I, 8, 8; MS. I, 2, 13; IV,\n10, 2; 14, 3. Verse 2 = TS. I, 1, 14, 4; TB. II, 8, 2, 5; T\xc3\x82. X, 2, 1; MS. IV,\n10, 1; 14, 3. Verse 3 = TB. II, 8, 2, 4; MS. IV, 14, 3.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. 'For health and wealth,' M. M.; see vol. xxxii, p. 193.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. If the accent is correct (Sa _m_ h. abhyamanta, Pad. abhi amanta), the\nclause, though containing no subordinating word, must be understood as\nstanding in logical dependence on the following, or--which in our case seems\nmore probable--on the preceding clause. Examples of this kind have been\ncollected by Delbruck, Altindische\n\np. 183\n\n[paragraph continues] Syntax, p. 43.--That k _ri_ sh _t_ i\xc2\xb4 _h_ should be\nnominative is very improbable; comp. Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 393. See also\nLeo Meyer, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XVI, 9.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Prof. Max Muller (vol. xxxii, p. 229) translates, 'For thou, god, art\nthe deliverer from all assaults;' he derives vishpa _t_ 'from vi and spa _s_ ,\nto bind.'\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. This verse has been treated of by Geldner, Vedische Studien, II, 156,\n158.\n\nNote 2. Geldner (loc. cit., 156) proposes two explanations for ubhayan. It may\nrefer either to the pious and the impious spoken of in the preceding verses,\nor to prapitvam and abhipitvam, which words Geldner believes to be masculine.\nI do not attach such weight to the Avestic frapithwo (Vend. III, 3) as to\ndraw, with Geldner, a conclusion from this word on the gender of the Vedic\nprapitva, and in every case I think that this explanation of ubhayan is very\nforced, while it is natural to refer ubhayan to the pious and impious, or as\nwe may express it in conformity with Vedic ideas, to 'men' (comp. manusha _h_\nPada 2, manave Pada 3), i. e. Aryans, and Dasyus (see VIII, 50, 8; 98, 6; IX,\n92, 5). Then ubhayan vi vidvan would have exactly the sane meaning as the\nwords in I, 51, 8. vi _g_ anihi a\xc2\xb4ryan ye _k_ a dasyava _h_.\n\nNote 3. On prapitva we have the two ingenious discussions of Geldner, Vedische\nStudien, II, 155 seq., and of Bloomfield in the fifth series of his\nContributions to the interpretation of the Veda, p. 24 seq. In my opinion\nBloomfield has not succeeded in proving that the words ending in -pitva\n(prapitva, abhipitva, sapitva, &c.) contain the stem pith, 'sap, drink,\nnourishment,' and that prapitva means the morning-pressure of Soma, which is\nusually designated as prata _h_ savana, abhipitva, the evening-pressure or the\nt _ri_ tiya-savana. I do not think it necessary, however,\n\np. 184\n\nto examine here the single points of his interesting and elaborate discussion,\nfor it seems to me that Geldner has conclusively shown that the meaning of\nthese words is different from what Bloomfield believes it to be: abhipitva, as\nGeldner (p. 155) states, is 'Erholung,' 'Rast,' and 'die Zeit des Rastens,'\n'Feierabend,' 'Abend;' prapitva (p. 178), on the other hand. means 'Vorlauf,'\n'das aufs Ziel Zugehen,' die vorgeruckte Tageszeit.'\n\nNote 4. _S_ a\xc2\xb4sya _h_ , 'governable,' does not give an impossible meaning. But\nshould we not have to correct _s_ a _m_ sya _h_ 'thou art to be praised by\nmen?'\n\nNote 5. On akra _h_ , comp. Vedische Studien, I, 168, and above, I, 143, 7.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Mana is another name of Agastya. See Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morg.\nGesellschaft, XLII, 221.\n\nNote 2. On the last words of the hymn--the regularly repeated conclusion of\nthe Agastya hymns--see M. M., vol. xxxii, p. xx, and also Bartholomae,\nBezzenberger's Beitrage, XV, 212. I do not think it very probable that isha is\nhere the name of an autumn month, as found iii the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a\nand others of the more modern Vedic texts; to me it would seem rather strange\nthat such a prayer for the fertility of that month should have formed, among\nthe Agastyas, the standing conclusion of their sacrificial hymns. But the\nnames of the two months isha and ur _g_ a seem to point to the existence of\ntwo adjectives meaning 'giving food' and 'giving sap.'--Then follows v _ri_\n_g_ ana, used as a masculine. Geldner (Vedische Studien, I, 151) indicates the\nfollowing passages, in which he believes that this masculine v _ri_ _g_ ana\noccurs: V, 44, 1; VI, 35, 5; VII, 32, 27; X, 27, 4; and the concluding Pada of\nthe Agastya hymns. Of these passages the two first seem to be open to doubt as\nto the correctness of the text. In V, 44, 1 the true reading may be prati _k_\ninam v _r i_sha _n_ am dohase; comp. verse 3, v _r i_sha _s_ i _s_ u _h_ , and\nI, 173, 6, where possibly v _r i_sha _n_ am should be read instead of v _ri_\n_g_ anam (Gottinger\n\np. 185\n\n[paragraph continues] Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1890, 417). In VI, 35, 5 I propose to\nread v _ri_ _n_ a _g_ am (Gott. Gel. Anzeigen, loc. cit., 416). In VII, 32, 27\nand X, 27, 4 v _ri_ _g_ ana (Padap. v _ri_ _g_ ana _h_ ; the letter d follows)\nand v _ri_ _g_ aneshu seem to be masculine, though it is not absolutely\nimpossible to see in these forms the nom. plur. and loc. plur. of the neuter v\n_ri_ _g_ ana. But I believe that any attempts to derive conclusions from these\nthree passages on the meaning of the masculine v _ri_ _g_ ana are hopeless.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1](sbe46051.htm)\n\n"
