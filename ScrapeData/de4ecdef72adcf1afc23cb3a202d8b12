The relations are three: (1) "common reference," _s \xc4\x81m\xc4\x81n\xc4\x81dhikara\xe1\xb9\x87ya,_\n(2) "relation as predicate _(vi \xc5\x9besha\xe1\xb9\x87a)_ and subject _(vi \xc5\x9beshya),_" and\n(3)"relation as indicated _(lakshya)_ and indicative term _(laksha \xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81)_." The\nproposition "Thou art That," _tat tvam asi,_ which is the keynote of the\nVed\xc4\x81nta (see p. 24), comes under all these categories. The term _That_ denotes\nliterally the whole aggregate of Ignorances together with the omniscient\ncosmic consciousness "determined" by the latter and with the transcendental\nconsciousness (see p. 30); but by "indication" or metonymy _(laksha \xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81)_ it\nsignifies only the transcendental consciousness. The term _Thou_ literally\ndenotes the aggregate of Ignorances conceived distributively (see p. 30 f.)\ntogether with limited individual consciousness "determined" by the\n\np. 110\n\nlatter, and with unlimited consciousness; and by "indication" it signifies\nonly the last. Now the proposition _Thou art That_ comes under the relation of\n"common reference"; for both _Thou_ and _That_ signify _Consciousness_\n(Brahma), in the former case as transcending perception, in the latter case as\nmanifested to perception in the form of finite distinction. Again, these terms\nare related as subject and predicate, that is, they are identified in thought\nby abstraction of their difference (their difference lying in the fact that\nthe one transcends perception, and the other does not). Lastly, these terms\nhave a metonymic relation. When we have abstracted the difference already\nmentioned, we may use both to signify the Consciousness, _That_ being the\n"indicated" and _Thou_ the "indicative" term. In the same way the three\nseveral terms _Being, Thought_ , and _Bliss,_ after due abstraction of\ndifference (namely phenomenal distinctions) designate "indicatively" the\nsingle indivisible Brahma essentially characterised by infinite being,\nthought, and bliss. For further details of the Hindu theories on these\nsubjects see Ved\xc4\x81nta-s\xc4\x81ra, Jacob\'s translation, p. 83 f., Athalye\'s notes on\nTarka-sangraha, \xc2\xa7 59, K\xc4\x81vyaprak\xc4\x81\xc5\x9ba, ch. ii., etc.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Appendix II: List of the Chief Upanishads](brk46.htm)\n\n'
