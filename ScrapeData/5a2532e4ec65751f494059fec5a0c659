Now follows the (rule regarding the ordeal by) balance.\n\n[29. Nand. infers from a text of Narada (not found in his Institutes), that\nthe plural is made use of in this Sutra in order to include women, children,\nsickly, old, and feeble persons.\n\n32\\. According to Nand., the particle _k_ a is used here in order to include\nfire, wind, grasshoppers, and other plagues.\n\nX. 5, 6. Y. II, 100.]\n\np. 56\n\n2; The transverse beam, by which the balance is to be suspended, should be\nfastened upon two posts, four Hastas above the ground (each), and should be\nmade two Hastas long.\n\n3\\. The beam of the balance should be made of strong wood (such as that of the\nKhadira or Tinduka trees), five Hastas long, and the two scales must be\nsuspended on both sides of it, (and the whole suspended upon the transverse\nbeam by means of an iron hook).\n\n4\\. A man out of the guild of goldsmiths, or of braziers, should make it equal\non both sides.\n\n5\\. Into the one scale the person (who is to be tried by this ordeal) should\nbe placed, and a stone (or earth or bricks) or some other (equivalent) of the\nsame weight into the other.\n\n6\\. The equivalent and the man having been made equal in weight and (the\nposition of the scales) well marked, the man should be caused to descend from\nthe balance.\n\n[2. One Hasta, 'cubit,' the modern 'hath,' equals two Vitasti, 'spans,' and 24\nA _n_ gulas, 'digits,' the modern A _n_ gul. See Prinsep, Useful Tables, p.\n122.\n\n3\\. See the plate of balance, according to the statements of Indian\nlegislators, in Professor Stenzler's Essay, '\xc3\x9cber die ind. Gottesurtheile,'\njournal of the German Oriental Society, IX.\n\n4\\. Nand. infers from the use of the plural number and from a passage of\nPitamaha and Narada (see the Institutes of the latter, 5, 122), that merchants\nmay also be appointed for this purpose.\n\n6\\. Nand. refers the term su _k_ ihnitau k _ri_ tva to the man and to the\nequivalent, both having to be marked 'with the king's seal or in some other\nway, in order that no one may suspect the weight of the equivalent or of the\nman to have been increased or lessened by the addition or removal of other\nobjects, or of clothes, ornaments, and the like.' 'Others' explain the term in\nthe way in which it has been rendered above.]\n\np. 57\n\n7\\. Next (the judge) should adjure by (the following) imprecations the balance\n\n8\\. And the person appointed to look after the weighing:\n\n9\\. Those places of torture which have been prepared for the murderer of a\nBrahma _n_ a, or for a false witness, the same places are ordained for a who\nperson appointed to look after the weighing, who acts fraudulently in his\noffice.\n\n10\\. 'Thou, O balance (dha _t_ a), art called by the same name as holy law\n(dharma); thou, O balance, knowest what mortal., do not comprehend.\n\n11\\. 'This man, being arraigned in a cause, is weighed upon thee. Therefore\nmayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.'\n\n12\\. Thereupon the judge should have him placed, into the one scale again. If\nhe rises in it, he is freed from the charge according to law.\n\n13\\. In case of the strings bursting, or of the splitting of the transverse\nbeam, the man should be placed in the scale once more. Thus the facts will be\nascertained positively, and a just sentence be the result.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI.](sbe07013.htm)\n\n"
