Little Is known of him, but his\nrecent death has created a painful\n\np. 14\n\nsensation all over India. He had lived for about thirty years at Ghazipur, and\nwas venerated as a Saint by the whole native community. The last nine years,\nhowever, he had almost entirely withdrawn from the world 1, living by himself\nin a compound surrounded by high walls and protected by a formidable gate.\nInside there was a small flower-garden, a well, a small temple, and his own\ndwelling-house, which consisted of one room. He never allowed the gate to be\nopened, and no one ever saw him except his younger brother. Once every week or\nten days, however, he would come up to the gate and converse for a few moments\nfrom within with any one who happened to be there. His younger brother always\nremained within calling-distance. But though his saintly brother had told him\nthat he could not any longer bear the misery which the Kali-yuga, i.e. the\npresent age, had brought upon India, he little suspected what his brother\nmeant. The venerable man, after taking his usual bath and performing his\ndevotions, seems to have covered his whole body with clarified butter, to have\nsprinkled himself all over with incense, then to have set fire to the four\ncorners of his lonely house, and when the flames had taken hold of it on all\nsides, to have deliberately thrown himself into the fire, thus performing his\nlast sacrifice. Before anybody could rescue him, the old man was burnt to\nashes, and what remained of him was consigned with due ceremony to the sacred\nwaters of the Ganges. All this happened only a few months ago. It is always\ndifficult to get an exact account of anything that\n\np. 15\n\nhappens in India. The conflagration of the house in which the old Saint had\nlived for many years cannot be doubted, nor the discovery of his burnt body.\nBut some of his friends, unwilling to admit his self-immolation, ascribe the\nfire to an accident, while others consider his voluntary sacrifice as the\nproper ending to his saintly life.\n\nHis name Pawari, sometimes spelt Pahari, is explained as a contraction of\nPavanahari, he who lives on air.\n\nHis teaching was probably much the same as that of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, but I\nhave not been able to get a more accurate account of it. His position,\nhowever, as a Sage and a Saint seems to have been generally recognised, and\nKeshub Chunder Sen is a sufficient authority for the fact that he well\ndeserved a place by the side of such men as Dayananda Sarasvati and Ramak _ri_\nsh _n_ a. The people of India evidently distinguish clearly between these\nprofessed ascetics and saints on one side, and mere reformers such as Rammohun\nRoy and Keshub Chunder Sen on the other. They evidently want to see a complete\nsurrender of the world and its pleasures, riches, and honours before they\nquite believe in the truth and the sincerity of any teachers and reformers.\nHaving undergone severe tortures and penances is likewise an essential\ncondition of Sainthood, and for the crowd at large even the power of working\nmiracles is by no means out of fashion yet as a test of being an inspired\nsage.\n\nThe best-known name by which some of these sages are called is Paramaha _m_\nsa, a name that hardly lends itself to translation in English. Scholars who\nlike to cavil and raise a smile\n\np. 16\n\nat every custom or tradition of the Hindus, translate it literally by Great\nGoose, but it would be more faithful to render that ancient title by High-\nsoaring Eagle. Besides, ha _m_ sa, though it is the same word as goose, is not\nthe same bird. But though these Paramaha _m_ sas form an elite by themselves,\nwe know how many men there have been and are even now in India who, by the\nasceticism and saintliness of their lives, deserve a place very near to the\nParamaha _m_ sas in our estimation. We know how Udayashankar, the Prime\nMinister of Bhavnagar, tried hard to revive, in his own case, the strict rules\nof life prescribed for the ancient Sa _m_ nyasins. The life of Keshub Chunder\nSen also, though he was a married man and travelled much and moved in the\nworld, was a life of extreme self-denial, as much as that of any Paramaha _m_\nsa.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[14:1](rls09.htm#fr_5) _Interpreter_ , June, 1898. _Indian Social Reformer_ ,\nJune 19, 1898.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Debendranath Tagore](rls10.htm)\n\n'
