'These rivers, my son, run, the eastern (like the Ganga) toward the east,\nthe western (like the Sindhu) toward the west. They go from sea to sea (i. e.\nthe clouds lift up the water from the sea to the sky, and send it back as rain\nto the sea). They become indeed sea. And as those rivers, when they are in the\nsea, do not know, I am this or that river,\n\n2\\. 'In the same manner, my son, all these creatures, when they have come back\nfrom the True, know not that they have come back from the True. Whatever these\ncreatures are here, whether a lion, or a wolf, or a boar, or a worm, or a\nmidge, or a gnat, or a musquito, that they become again and again.\n\n3\\. 'That which is that subtile essence, in it all that exists has its self.\nIt is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O _S_ vetaketu, art it.'\n\n'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.\n\n'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[102:1](sbe01128.htm#fr_290) The next question which the son is supposed to\nhave asked is: If a man who has slept in his own house, rises and goes to\nanother village, he. knows that he has come from his own house. Why then do\npeople not know that they have come from the Sat?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 11](sbe01129.htm)\n\n"
