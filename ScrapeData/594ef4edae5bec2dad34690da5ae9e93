O _S_ yava _s_ va, sing boldly with [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:1:1) the\nMaruts, the singers who, worthy themselves of sacrifice, rejoice in their\nguileless glory [2](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:1:2) according to their nature.\n\n2\\. They are indeed boldly the friends of strong power; they on their march\nprotect all who by themselves are full of daring [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:2:1).\n\n3\\. Like rushing bulls, these Maruts spring over [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:3:1)\nthe dark cows (the clouds) [2](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:3:2), and then we perceive\nthe might of the Maruts in heaven and on earth.\n\n4\\. Let us boldly offer praise and sacrifice to your Maruts, to all them who\nprotect the generation of men, who protect the mortal from injury.\n\n5\\. They who are worthy, bounteous, men of perfect strength, to those heavenly\nMaruts who are worthy of sacrifice, praise the sacrifice!\n\n6\\. The tall men [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:6:1), coming near with their bright\nchains, and their weapon, have hurled forth their spears. Behind these Maruts\nthere came by itself the splendour of heaven, like laughing lightnings\n[2](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:6:2).\n\n7\\. Those who have grown up on earth, or in the wide sky, or in the realm of\nthe rivers, or in the abode of the great heaven,\n\n8\\. Praise that host of the Maruts, endowed with true strength and boldness\n[1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:8:1), whether those rushing heroes have by themselves\nharnessed (their horses) for triumph,\n\n9\\. Or whether these brilliant Maruts have in the (speckled) cloud clothed\nthemselves in wool [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:9:1), or\n\np. 313\n\nwhether by their strength they cut the mountain asunder with the tire of their\nchariot;\n\n10\\. Call them comers, or goers, or enterers, or followers, under all these\nnames, they watch on the straw [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:10:1) for my sacrifice.\n\n11\\. The men (the Maruts) watch, and their steeds watch. Then, so brilliant\nare their forms to be seen, that people say, Look at the strangers\n[1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:11:1)!\n\n12\\. In measured steps [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:12:1) and wildly shouting\n[2](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:12:2) the gleemen [3](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:12:3) have\ndanced toward the well (the cloud). They who appeared one by one like thieves,\nwere helpers to me to see the light [4](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:12:4).\n\n13\\. Worship, therefore, O seer, that host of Maruts, and keep and delight\nthem with your voice, they who are themselves wise\n[1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:13:1) poets, tall heroes armed with lightning-spears.\n\n14\\. Approach, O seer, the host of Maruts, as a woman approaches a friend, for\na gift [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:14:1); and you, Maruts, bold in your strength\n[2](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:14:2), hasten hither, even from heaven, when you have\nbeen praised by our hymns.\n\n15\\. If he, after perceiving them, has approached them as gods with an\noffering, then may he for a gift remain united with the brilliant (Maruts),\nwho by their ornaments are glorious on their march.\n\n16\\. They, the wise [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:16:1) Maruts, the lords, who, when\nthere was inquiry for their kindred, told me of the cow, they told me of P\n_ri_ _s_ ni as their mother, and of the strong Rudra as their father.\n\n17\\. The seven and seven heroes [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:17:1) gave me each a\nhundred. On the Yamuna I clear off glorious wealth in cows, I clear wealth in\nhorses.\n\np. 314\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to _S_ yava _s_ va \xc3\x82treya. Metre, Anush _t_ ubh, 1-5,\n7-15; Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti, 6, 16, and 17. Saya _n_ a seems to take verse 16 as an Anush _t_\nubh, which of course is a mistake. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS.,\nTS., TB., MS., AV.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. One expects the dative or accusative after ar _k_ a. The instrumental\nleaves us no choice but to translate, 'Sing with the Maruts, who are\nthemselves famous as singers.' Cf. I, 6, 8; V, 60, 8.\n\nNote 2. On _s_ rava _h_ madanti, see Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 75.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Dh _ri_ shadvinas may also refer to the Maruts.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. One expects adhi instead of ati, see Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 95 seq.\n\nNote 2. See note to I, 37, 5; also, Bartholomae in Bezzenberger's Beitrage,\nXV, 211. The whole verse has been discussed by Benfey, Vedica und Verwandtes,\np. 152 seq.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. This verse has been discussed before, I, 168, 7, note. Benfey\n(Nachrichten der K. Ges. der Wiss. zu Gottingen, 1876, 28 Juni; comp. Vedica\nund Verwandtes, p. 141) translated it: 'Heran \xe2\x80\xa6 haben die Helden, die hehren,\nihre Speere geschleudert; ihnen, den Maruts, nach (erheben sich) traun\ngleichsam lachende Blitze, erhebt sich selbst des Himmels Glanz.' _Ri_ shva\xc2\xb4\n_h_ seems here, as in verse 13, to refer to the Maruts, as in IV, 19, I,\nrishvam refers to Indra, though it can be used of weapons also, see VI, 18,\n10. As to the instrumentalis comitativus in rukmai _h_ and yudha\xc2\xb4, see Lanman,\np. 335.\n\np. 315\n\nNote 2. Benfey's explanation of _g_ a _gh_ _gh_ ati _h_ is ingenious, though\nit leaves some difficulties. The writing of _gh_ _gh_ in Devanagari may have\nbeen meant for _g_ _gh_ , as in akhkhalik _r i_tya, VII, 103. 3. But there\nremains the fact that _g_ aksh occurs in the sense of laughing, I, 33, 7, and\none does not see why it should have undergone a Prakritic change in our\npassage, and not there. It might be a mimetic word, to express the sound of\nrattling and clattering; cf. _g_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ anabhavan, VIII, 43, 8.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. As to the adjective in the masculine gender after _s_ ardhas, see I,\n37, 1, note. The meaning of _r i_bhvas, bold, rabid, is doubtful; see\nBergaigne, Rel. Ved. II, 408.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a takes Parush _n_ i as the name of one of the rivers of the\nPunjab, called the Iravati, and at present the Ravi. Parush _n_ i might mean\nspeckled, muddy, as a synonym of p _ri_ _s_ ni. Roth has suggested that parush\n_n_ i might here mean cloud. But what is the meaning of parush _n_ i in a\nsimilar passage, IV, 22, 2. (\xc3\x8dndra _h_ ) _s_ riye parush _n_ im ushama _n_ a\n_h_ -u\xc2\xb4r _n_ am yasya _h_ parva _n_ i sakhya\xc2\xb4ya vivye? If it means that Indra\nclothed himself in speckled wool, that wool might be intended for what we call\nwoolly or fleecy clouds. As the Maruts often perform the same acts as Indra,\nwe might read in our verse uta sma te parush _n_ is u\xc2\xb4r _n_ a _h_ , and\npronounce uta sma te parush _n_ ia u\xc2\xb4r _n_ a _h_ , though Lanman, p. 395,\nobjects to ias for is in the acc. plur. See, however, heti\xc2\xb4 _h_ adevi _h_ in\nVIII, 61, 16. The instrumental singular is possible, but again unusual with\nvas, parush _n_ ya u\xc2\xb4r _n_ a. Possibly the original meaning of parush _n_ i\nmay have been forgotten, and if the name of the river Parush _n_ i was\ngenerally known, it might easily have taken the place of parush _n_ i, the\ncloud. For other explanations see Roth, \xc3\x9cber gewisse Kurzungen, Wien, 1887;\nBartholomae, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXIX, 583; Schmidt, Die Pluralbildungen\nder indogermanischen Neutra, 1889, p. 307.\n\np. 316\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Vish _t_ ara _h_ does not occur again, and Lanman is therefore quite\njustified in assigning to it the meaning of straw (p. 339). He paraphrases:\n'Let their customs carry them where they may, yet when I sacrifice, they wait\nquietly on the straw, i. e. the altar, for it.' He reads in the Pada text vi-\nstare for vi-stara _h_. Vish _t_ arin, which occurs AV. IV, 34, 1, does not\nthrow much light on the exact meaning of vish _t_ ara in this place. If we\nretain Vish _t_ ara _h_ , the nominative, we must assign to it the meaning of\ncrowd, and refer it to the Maruts.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Paravata is a turtle-dove (VS. XXIV, 25), and it is just possible that\nthe Maruts might have been compared to them. But paravata is used in VIII,\n100, 6, as an epithet of vasu, wealth, and in VIII, 34, 18, we read of ratis\n(not ratris), i. e. gifts of Paravata. The river Sarasvati is called\nparavataghni, killing Paravata, VI, 61, 2, and in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ av. Br. IX,\n4, 1I, we hear that Tura _s_ ravas and the Paravatas offered their Somas\ntogether. I am therefore inclined to take Paravata, lit. distant people,\nextranei, strangers, as a name of an Aryan border clan with whom the Vedic\nAryas were sometimes at war, sometimes at peace. In that case the frontier-\nriver, the Sarasvati, might be called the destroyer or enemy of the Paravatas.\nAs their wealth and gifts have been mentioned, to compare the Maruts with the\nParavatas may mean no more than that the Maruts also are rich and generous.\nLudwig thinks of the \xce\xa0\xce\xb1\xcf\x81\xcf\x85\xe1\xbf\x86\xcf\x84\xce\xb1\xce\xb9, which seems more doubtful. For a different\ninterpretation see Delbruck, Syntax, p. 531.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. I take _kh_ anda _h_ stubh in the sense of stepping (according to) a\nmeasure, as explained in my Preface (1st ed.), [p. cii](sbe3213.htm#page_cii),\nthough I do not doubt that that meaning was afterwards forgotten, and replaced\nby the technical meaning of stubh, to shout. See Bohtlingk-Roth, s. v. stubh,\nand\n\np. 317\n\nstobhagrantha, Sama-veda, Bibl. Ind., II, p. 519. It can hardly be supposed\nthat such artificial performances of Vedic hymns, as are preserved in the\nSama-veda, could have suggested the first names of the ancient metres.\n\nNote 2. Kubhanyu can only be derived from bhan, to shout.\n\nNote 3. The kiri _n_ a _h_ are probably intended here for strolling minstrels\nwho, when they approached the well of a village (here the cloud), might be\ntaken either for friends or foes.\n\nNote 4. D _ri_ _s_ i tvishe. Grassmann translates: 'Wie Rauberbanden schienen\nsie geschart zum Andrang meinem Blick.' Ludwig better: 'Helfer waren sie,\nglanz zu sehn.' We must either read d _ri_ _s_ e tvishe, to see the light, or\nd _ri_ _s_ e tvishi, to be seen by light. See, however, P. G., Ved. Stud. p.\n225.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. Vedhas, wise. The different possible meanings of this word have been\ndiscussed by Ludwig, Z. D. M. G. XL, p. 716; and by Bartholomae, in Kuhn's\nZeitschrift, XXVII, p. 361.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. On dana\xc2\xb4, see Lanman, pp. 533, 335; P. G., Ved. Stud. p. 101.\n\nNote 2. Dh _ri_ sh _n_ ava _h_ o _g_ asa to be read   \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84.\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nThis verse, as Roth says, is very obscure, and the translation is purely\ntentative. Grassmann derives vaksha _n_ a from vah in the sense of an\noffering. It may more easily be derived from vaksh, i. e. what gives increase,\nand be taken as an instrumental. Pischel shows that in many passages vaksha\n_n_ a in the plural has the meaning of yoni, also of the yoni on the altar.\nBut even this meaning does not throw much light on our passage. The first pada\nmay possibly be taken in an interrogative and conditional sense, or we may\ntranslate: 'Now, having perceived them, may he, as a refreshing draught goes\nto the gods, come\n\np. 318\n\ntogether with the Maruts for his reward.' Whatever the verse may mean, esham\ndeva\xc2\xb4n cannot mean the gods of the Maruts, or prove the existence of idols, as\nBollensen (Z. D. M. G. XXII, 587) and even Muir (S. T. V, 454) imagined. The\ntranslation of Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 101, suribhi _h_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ibhi _h_ mit\n'Herren, die schmieren, d. h. ordentlich bezahlen,' seems too exclusively\nGerman. Could a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ in be an adjective, in the sense of possessed of a _\xc3\xb1_\n_g_ is?\n\n##### Verse 16.\n\nNote 1. If _s_ ikvas is not to be derived from _s_ ak (see Hubschmann,\nVocalsystem, pp. 64, 186), we should have to derive ni _s_ , night, from a\nroot altogether different from that which yields nakt, nakta, &c. But how does\n_s_ ikvas come to mean, according to Ludwig, both bunch of flowers, and\nflaming? Does he connect it with _s_ ikha? Surely, if _s_ iksh may stand for\n_s_ i _s_ ak-s, why not _s_ ik-vas for * _s_ i _s_ akvas? 'Bright' leaves it\ndoubtful whether it means clever or flaming.\n\n##### Verse 17.\n\nNote 1. The seven, seven heroes need not be the Maruts, but some liberal\npatrons who rewarded _S_ yava _s_ va. See Bergaigne, Rel. Ved. II, 371.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 53.
