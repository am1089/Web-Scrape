For (Brahman is) without form merely, since it is the principal agent\nwith regard to that.\n\nBrahman, although by entering into bodies, human, divine, and so on, it\nbecomes connected with various forms, yet is in itself altogether devoid of\nform, and therefore does not share that subjection to karman which in the case\nof the soul is due to its embodiedness.--Why?--Because as it is that which\nbrings about names and forms it stands to them in the relation of a superior\n(pradhana). For the text, 'The Ether (Brahman) indeed is the accomplisher\n\np. 611\n\nof names and forms; that which is without these two is Brahman,' teaches that\nBrahman, although entering into all beings, is not touched by name and form,\nbut is that which brings about name and form.--But, an objection is raised, if\nBrahman is the inner ruler of beings in so far as he has them for its body,\nhow can it be said that it is altogether destitute of form?--There is a\ndifference, we reply. The individual soul is connected with the shape of the\nbody in which it dwells because it participates in the pleasures and pains to\nwhich the body gives rise; but as Brahman does not share those pleasures and\npains, it has no shape or form. And the scriptural injunctions and\nprohibitions apply to those only who are under the power of karman. The\nhighest Brahman therefore is like a being without form, and hence, although\nabiding within all things, free from all imperfection and endowed with all\nblessed qualities.\n\nBut, an objection is raised, texts such as 'the True, knowledge, infinite is\nBrahman' suggest a Brahman whose nature is constituted exclusively by non-\ndifferentiated light; while at the same time a Brahman endowed with qualities\n--such as omniscience, being the cause of the world, being the inner Self of\nall, having the power of immediately realising its wishes and purposes--is\nexpressly negatived by texts such as 'not so, not so' (B _ri_. Up. II, 3, 6),\nand therefore must be held to be false. How then can it be maintained that\nBrahman possesses the 'twofold characteristics' mentioned under Sutra 11?--To\nthis the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15. And in the same way as a Brahman consisting of light; the texts\nthus not being devoid of meaning](sbe48359.htm)\n\n"
