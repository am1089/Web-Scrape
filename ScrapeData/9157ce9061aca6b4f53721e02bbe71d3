By whom was it contained?  \n    What was in those thick depths of darkness?\n\n    When death was not, nor immortality,  \n    When night was not separate from day,  \n    Then That vibrated motionless, one with Its own glory,  \n    And beside That, nothing else existed.\n\n    When darkness was hidden in darkness,  \n    Undistinguished, like one mass of water,  \n    Then did _That_ which was covered with darkness  \n    Manifest Its glory by heat.\n\n    Now first arose Desire, the primal seed of mind,  \n    [The sages have seen all this in their hearts,  \n    Separating existence from non-existence.]  \n    Its rays spread above, around, and below,  \n    The glory became creative.  \n    The Self, sustained as cause below,  \n    Projected, as Effect, above.\n\n    Who then understood? Who then declared  \n    How came into being this Projected?  \n    Lo, in its wake followed even the Gods,  \n    Who can say, therefore, whence It came?  \nWhence arose this projected, and whether sustained or not,  \nHe alone, O Beloved, who is its Ruler in the highest heaven knoweth,  \nNay, it may be that even he knoweth it not!  \n                         Rig VEDA: Hymn of Creation.\n\nI\n\nLIKE the delicate charm that is common to honourable women; like the\ndistinctive greatness of saints and heroes; like the intellectual breadth of a\nuniversity\n\np. 138\n\ncity; like all the finest things in the world in fact, Indian thought had\nremained till the year 1893 without a definition, and without a name. For the\nword _dharmma_ can in no sense be taken as the name of a religion. It is the\nessential quality, the permanent, unfluctuating core, of substance,--the man-\nness of man, _life-ness_ of life, as it were. But as such it may assume any\nform, according to the secret of the individuality we are considering. To the\nartist his art, to the man of science his science, to the monk his vow, to the\nsoldier his sovereign\'s name, to each believer his own particular belief--any\nof these, or all, may be _dharmma_. There is indeed another, and collective\nsense--somewhat akin to the English _commonwealth_ , or, better still,\nperhaps, translated as _the national righteousness_ \\--but even this does not\nconnote a creed. It applies to that whole system of complex action and\ninteraction, on planes moral, intellectual, economic, industrial, political,\nand domestic--which we know as India or the national habit. It was for this\n_dharmma_ that the Rani of Jhansi fought. By their attitude to it Pathan,\nMogul, and the Englishman, are judged, each in his turn, by the Indian\npeasantry. As head of this system, Judisthira, the Indian Charlemagne,\nreceived the name by which the people know him to this day, of Dharmma-Raja.\nAnd what this _dharmma_ was, in all its bearings, is perhaps best laid down in\nthe charge of the dying Bhishma to the future sovereigns of India, in the\neighteenth book of the Mahabharata.\n\nIt is clear that such a conception is very inadequately rendered by the\nEnglish word "religion." It is clear also that to dissect out and set in order\nthe distinctively religious elements in an idea so definite at its centre, and\nso nebulous at its edges--claiming thereby to have defined the religion of the\nIndian peoples--would be a task of extreme difficulty.\n\np. 139\n\n[paragraph continues] It must have been in the face of just such problems that\nMax Muller exclaimed, "Ancient words are round, and modern square!"\n\nAs the forest grows spontaneously, of many kinds, each like all the others\nonly in the common fact of the quest of light, and every plant having n\ncomplete right to regard its own as the chosen seed, so amongst the Hindu\npeople, up to the twentieth century of this Christian era, grew faiths and\ncreeds. Islam itself was scarcely an exception to this rule. For the spirit\nthat makes a township, after learning English, differentiate itself sharply\ninto Hindu and Mohammedan social cliques, is of modern growth. It appears to\nbe a result of that false interpretation which reads the history of India as\nan account of the struggle between the two ideas. In the life of the villages\nthere is no such strong distinction. In Bengal and Behar, the sons of Hindu\nand Mohammedan gentlemen grow up in the closest fraternity and fellowship. In\nthe North-West Provinces they mingle their names. In the Moslem zenanas of the\nsame districts the Hindu babies of the village are privileged guests. Every\nHindu guru accepts Mohammedan as well as Hindu disciples. Every Mohammedan\nfakir is sought by Hindu as well as Mohammedan devotees. In the South,\nnarrowly orthodox as the South is counted, the proudest feature of Trevandrum\nis the shrine dedicated to a Mohammedan princess, who forsook courts and\npalaces for the worship of Trevandrum\'s local god. Over and over again, in the\npolitical world, have the armies of Delhi and the nawabs been led to victory\nby Hindu generals; and in every Native State to this day will be found\npositions of responsibility and power assigned to men whose creed is that\nwhich the sovereign\'s is not. A more beautiful tribute was never surely paid\nthan that spoken of the Mahratta queen: "she was peculiarly kind and\n\np. 140\n\nconsiderate to such of her subjects as differed from her in faith." But indeed\nthe intolerance of Mohammedanism itself has been grossly exaggerated by\nChristian observers, who seem curiously incompetent to grasp the secret of an\nEastern attitude. This intolerance could never, for instance, be compared with\nthat of the Roman Church. The necessity of making a strong and competent\nnation out of a few warring tribes led to the enunciation of a brief and\nsimple religious thesis; but the Prophet did not fail, in true Asiatic\nfashion, to remind his people that "God is the God of all creatures, not of\none section only," and to exempt especially from condemnation all the alien\nreligions definitely known to him, namely, Christianity and Judaism, "the\npeoples of the Book." Truly the quarrel of that stern spirit of righteousness\nwas with unfaithfulness, not with other faiths, however strongly, under\nunforeseen military and political exigencies, it might seem to lend itself to\nthe contrary interpretation. The fact that Mohammedans have sometimes held\nanother opinion is no argument as to the teaching of their religion in its\npurity, and it must be remembered that "dog of an infidel" is an expression\nhurled as freely against Spaniard and Crusader, as ever against what\nChristians called a Pagan. No. The feud between Delhi and Ghazni was no more a\nbattle between _Din_ and _Dharmma_ than was that so long existing between\nFrance and England, the combat of the Catholic against the Protestant\nChurches. Even Sikh and Mahratta risings were only the psychological transfer\nof regional power-centres. The famous jewelled shawl of the Hindu State of\nBaroda was made quite naturally under the old _r egime_, to be sent to the\ntomb of Mohammed at Medina!\n\nSome air of the deserts, some tradition of the pastoral habit, some strong\nmemory of Persia and Arabia. must indeed have come with the successful\n\np. 141\n\ninvader to make the stay-at-home invaded resenting and distrustful. But the\ntalk about cow-killing can hardly be taken as sincere, since in that case the\narms of chivalrous Hindus would to-day be turned against a newer power. It\nmust be understood as purely symbolic of the strained relations naturally\nexisting between industrialised agricultural communities on the one hand, and\non the other the militant sons of the desert accustomed to live by keeping and\nkilling flocks and herds. But the same process that tamed the nomad into a\nmember of a peasant community, and converted boatmen and tillers of the soil\ninto Mussulmans, minimised in course of time even these differences of\nassociation. The familiar sight of the Mohammedan _bhisti_ , holding his\ngoatskin below the hydrant-mouth for water, and the Hindu water-carrier with\nhis earthen pot coming in his turn, is an instance of the contrast as it now\nexists. Two different civilisations stand side by side, but they are friendly\ncastes, not rival nationalities.\n\nIn the religious consciousness of Islam there is nothing that is without\nanalogy amongst the faiths that have sprung up on Indian soil. Every one is\ntolerant of the idea of "the one true church," for it is held by Hindus to be\na necessity of the early stages of religious development. Allah is of course\nthe Personal God: but then the worshipper of Vishnu has always had to admit\nhis brother\'s right to offer praise to Siva, though the name left himself\nunstirred. Why not Allah, therefore, equally? The Hindu uses images: to the\nMussulman the image is abhorrent. True, but every Hindu hopes to escape some\nday from the necessity of using images. Who is not touched by the devotional\ncustom of Hindu women, bathing the reflection of the Holy Child in the mirror\nand saying, "This which we bathe is not the image: neither is the\n\np. 142\n\nimage He whom we worship!" Are not the saints for ever telling the idolater\nthat even to name the Infinite Unity is sacrilege? And what Mohammedan saint\nhas failed to say the same? The dispute about the image, in the light of such\nfacts, becomes a mere difference of opinion as to the use of the concrete in\nthe early stages of an education. Indeed, Hinduism itself has shown its power\nin modern times to throw out sects that decry the use of images as strongly as\nIslam.\n\nHence it would appear that the important points at issue between Hindus and\nMussulmans are rather details of purification and domestic practice, than\nreligious or doctrinal. This fact becomes increasingly evident as the higher\nphases of the two faiths are reached. For the more completely either is\nrealised, the more perfectly is it fused in the other. Sufi-ism * leads the\nsoul by love, and the Vedanta leads it by knowledge, love, or emancipated\nmotive, as the case may be; but for both alike the theme is of a common goal,\nwhere all sense of difference shall cease, and the small self be swallowed up\nin the universal. Of each of the two faiths, then, it may be said, that it has\nnothing to lose and everything to gain by the more complete development of the\nother. Mohammed, Krishna, Buddha, Sankaracharya, \xe2\x80\xa0 are not so many deplorable\nobstacles in each other\'s\n\np. 143\n\npaths, but rather widely separated examples of a common type--the radiant\nAsiatic personage, whose conception of nationality lies in a national\nrighteousness, and whose right to be a leader of men rests on the fact that he\nhas seen God face to face. Such souls cannot fail to recognise each other, and\nthe Prophet was not slow to salute Moses and the Christ, the only examples of\nhis own order whose names he knew.\n\nThus it is easy to realise that as long as Hinduism remained nameless and\nvague, the sense of difference between itself and Islam was also obscure,\nsubject to all the mitigating influences of a common Orientalism, intensified\nhere and there doubtless by political ideas, but tempered again by manifold\nsocial and economic bonds. And if, with definition, the Indian religions are\nto take on a more sectarian character, is it not clear that this is only in\norder to be joined again with the faith of Arabia, in a new and deeper\nconsciousness of that which is their actual ground of union--the Asiatic\nsynthesis of life?\n\nIt is not difficult to understand the mental outlook that is expressed in the\nnamelessness of Hinduism. An immense people, filling a vast territory,\nunconscious of the completeness of their boundaries, or of any sharpness of\ncontrast between themselves and neighbouring nations, were necessarily\nincapable of summing up their thought, to give it a name. A knowledge of\nlimits and of difference there must be, before there can be definition, and it\nis only when India sees herself reflected as a whole in the glass of a foreign\nadministration and a foreign language that she can dream of limitation.\nBesides, in things religious, what was there that was not included within the\nHindu area? If, crossing the Himalayas and reaching China and Mongolia, men\ncame in contact with unknown rites and superstitions, they\n\np. 144\n\ncould always supply parallel or analogy from their home life and association.\nStrange and powerful goddesses were adored in China. But the worship of the\nMother is so old in India that its origin is lost in the very night of time.\nWhat an age of common faiths that must have been that left us the Virgin Kanya\n(Kanya Kumari) as tutelary deity of Cape Comorin, and Kwannyon the Mother as\nthe giver of all blessings, in Japan to this day! Who is to say which is\nolder, _Kari_ , the Mother-Queen of Heaven, of Chinese mythology, or _Kali_ of\nBengal? Even these conceptions, however, dating as they clearly must from the\ndays of that matriarchate when nations and races were not yet differentiated--\neven these do not represent the earliest stratum of religious thought in India\nor in Asia.\n\nAll through the Old Testament, and throughout the story of the rise of\nMohammedanism, we hear of "stones" as objects of worship. It is the black and\nmystic Kaaba, that is to this day the symbol of their unity to all the peoples\nof Islam. And through. out India still there are races of working folk who ask\nno better symbol of divinity than rude stones, selected with some care\npossibly, and then set up, singly or in a row, perhaps in an enclosure,\nperhaps not, to be regarded henceforth as objects of reverence. The people who\nuse these emblems--for they cannot be regarded as images--may be anything,\nfrom sudras, or peasants, as I have seen them in the South, to Bhutias, or\ngipsy-like wanderers, as one meets with them in the Himalayas.\n\nEverywhere in common life the miraculous elements are fire and light. And\nperhaps it is natural that oil, with its mystic power of leaping into flame,\nshould be the characteristic offering in the worship of these stones. A Bhutia\nshrine will sometimes contain nothing but lamps. These are small and made of\niron, like round-bowled dessert\n\np. 145\n\nspoons at right angles to the handle, which is a spike stuck into the ground,\nand I have seen as many as sixteen or seventeen in one tiny temple. There was\nhere neither image nor symbol other than the lamps themselves, and the pilgrim\non leaving would tear off a shred of his garment, and tie it to a bush or a\ntree close by, there joining hundreds of tokens like itself of the wayfaring\ncongregation whose spirits bad met unseen in a common act of adoration. But\nthe place, as is always the case with these peasant oratories, was where the\nview was finest, and the cry of the soul to commune with Nature most intense.\nSometimes the sacred stones themselves are smeared with oil, for the very\ntouch of the wondrous fluid that nourishes light seems to be holy.\n\nTo richer races in India only clarified butter is good enough for use in the\nservice of the altar, and we of Europe require the great wax tapers. But can\nwe not trace through all these a single common process of the sanctification\nof labour by the products of labour? "We worship the Ganges with the water of\nthe Ganges, but we _must_ worship," said a Hindu. Similarly does the peasant\ndream of the sacred oil, and the pastoral Toda * worship his cowbells. Is it\nnot true that if all could be blotted out in a moment from the human memory,\nthe Eucharist and the sanctuary-lamp from Christianity, flickering light and\nfragrant flowers from the Mussulman grave, oils and fruits and incense from\nthe Eastern worshipper, it would only be to spring forth fresh again to-morrow\n--corn, wine, and oil to the peasant, scented gums to the lover of gardens,\nthe Good Shepherd the ideal of the herdsman, the ship of salvation the hope of\nfisher-folk? What are mythologies after all but the jewel-casket of humanity,\n\np. 146\n\nby means of which its wealth of dreams and loves and sighs in every generation\nbecomes the unperishing and imperishable treasure of the after-comers? The\nmystery of the birth of faith is about us always.\n\nAll the great Asiatic faiths--that is to say, the world-religions--would seem\nto have been born of the overflow of something that may be called tentatively\nthe Aryan thought-power, upon the social and religious formations of earlier\nages. Taoism in China, Zoroastrianism in Persia, and Hinduism in India, are\nall as three different applications of a single original fund of insight and\nspeculation, and Islam itself has incorporated Sufi-ism after reaching the\nAryan region. Doubtless of all these India developed her share of the\ninheritance with the greatest freedom and perfection, but we recognise common\nelements in all alike.\n\nII\n\nAs the basis of Indian thought rests deep in the very foundation of human\nevolution, so it has not, failed, at each new point in the historic\ndevelopment, to add something to the great superstructure. The whole story of\nIndia may be read in a philosophic idea. The constitutional ceremonies of the\nkingdom of Travancore contain clear indications of the transition from the\nmatriarchate which was probably characteristic of the old Dravidian *\ncivilisation, to the patriarchate, which was Aryan. In the yearly\n\np. 147\n\nvillage-worship of the heroic figures of the "Mahabharata" which is common\nthroughout the South, we have what may be the effort of distant peoples to\ninclude themselves in the "Great India" of Bhishma, Judisthira, and the\nnational Epics. * The charge of country gunpowder which is fired off in the\ntemples of the Southern Dekkan on festival days is sufficient evidence that\northodoxy was once aggressive, eager, absorbent of things new, fearful of\nnothing, and friendly to advance. It is a popular superstition that the East\nstands still. Children observe no motion of the stars. But the fact is that\none generation is no more like another at Benares than in Paris. Every saint,\nevery poet, adds something to the mighty pile which is unlike all that went\nbefore. And this is quite as true of the thought expressed in the vernaculars,\nas of the all-dominating culture contained in the classic Sanskrit. Chaitanya\nin Bengal, the Ten Gurus of the Sikhs, Ram Das and Tokuram in Maharashtra, and\nRamanuja in the South--each of these was to his own time as the very\npersonification of the national philosophy, relating it again in its wholeness\nto the common life. Each such great saint appears to the people as the\nincarnation, the revelation, of themselves and their own powers, and the\nchurch founded by him becomes a nation. Thus arose the Mahratta Confederacy.\nThus arose the kingdom of Lahore. And far away in Arabia, Islam formed itself\nin the same fashion. For the law that we are considering is not peculiar to\nIndia; it is common to the whole of Asiatic life.\n\nThe Hindu world in its entirety, then, is one with\n\np. 148\n\nthe highest philosophy of Hinduism. The much-talked of Vedanta is only the\ntheoretic aspect of that synthesis whose elements make up the common life. The\nmost unlettered, idolatrous-seeming peasant will talk, if questioned, of the\nimmanence of God. He recognises that Christianity is fundamentally true,\nbecause the missionaries are clear that there is but one Supreme. The\nquestion, What would happen could the nation be divorced for a single\ngeneration from the knowledge of Sanskrit? is only another way of asking, What\nis the actual dynamic force existing at a given moment in the Hindu people?\nWhat are the characteristic ideas that are now an inbred habit, past the reach\nof authority to substantiate, or disaster to shake? It is given only to great\nevents and to the imagination of genius to find the answer to such questions.\nYet some indications there are, of what that answer might be.\n\nBuddhism was the name given to the Hinduism of the first few centuries of the\nChristian era, when precipitated in a foreign consciousness. What authority\ndid it claim? What explanations did it give of the existence of the physical\nuniverse? Of the soul? Of evil? What did it offer to humanity as the goal of\nthe ethical struggle? The answer to these questions will certainly have to be\ngiven in terms of ideas, or variants of ideas, derived from the pre-existent\nstock of Hinduism. And so, though the particular formulation may be regarded\nas heresy, the significance of its testimony on the point we are considering\ncannot be disputed. It must be remembered that there never was, in India, a\nreligion known as Buddhism, with temples and priests of its own order. There\nwas a tendency towards popularising truths that had previously been regarded\nas fit only for the learned, and there was an immense unofficial enthusiasm\nfor a towering\n\np. 149\n\npersonality, doubtless, and for the interpretations which were identified with\nhim, even as there is in Bengal to-day for Chaitanya. There came also to be a\nvast imperial organisation, highly centralised, coherent in all its parts,\nfull of the geographical consciousness, uttering itself in similar\narchitectural forms in the East and West of India, passionately eager to unify\nand elevate the people and to adorn the land. This Indian Empire was in full\nand living communication with China, Japan, Syria, and Egypt. It had traffic\nand commerce by land and sea. It sent abroad ambassadors, merchants and\nmissionaries. And within its own territories it made roads, planted trees and\norchards, dug wells, established hospitals, and insisted on the cessation of\nviolence even towards dumb creatures. *\n\nJust as the Protestant Reformation, releasing the mental energy of the people\nfrom thraldom to authoritative commentaries, has been the power within the\nrise of modern Europe, so the kernel and spring of the Asokan and succeeding\nempires was a similar assertion--not of the right of private judgment: this\nnever required vindication in India: but--of the equal right of every section\nof society to enter the super-social, or monastic life. For we must not forget\nthat in the East enfranchisement is always primarily religious and moral, not\npolitical. Power civic and national is there amongst the direct effects of the\nhigher consciousness, never its cause. It is a man\'s right to renounce the\nworld, and not manhood suffrage, which constitutes his equality with the\nhighest. This sudden realisation of the spiritual life in all parts of society\nat once conferred on every man under Buddhism, whatever his birth or position,\nthe right to make his opinion felt, the strength to exercise his full weight\nof moral influence.\n\np. 150\n\n[paragraph continues] The result was an immense consolidation and blossoming\nof nationality. Men felt that they walked on air. They were born to receive\nand pass on the great message of human brotherhood. They were to go out into\n_all_ the world and preach the Gospel to every creature. What must not have\nbeen the faith and enthusiasm of the common people, when merchants, traders,\nand caravan-servants could suffice to make a permanent contribution to the\nreligion of the powerful Empire of China? It was a great age, and only those\nwho have seen the colossal fragments which remain of it to this day can form\nany idea of its wealth and vigour.\n\nAnd yet Asoka\'s conversion had not been to a new religion, but only into the\npiety of his time. "I, King Piyadasi, beloved of the gods, obtained true\nintelligence ten years after my anointing." Hence the thing that we call\nBuddhism ends its career in India very gradually. He who has first visited\nEllora * is surprised, on entering Elephanta, \xe2\x80\xa0 to find the Buddha-like figure\non his left to be Siva, and the Triumph of Durga on his right. At Ellora\nitself there must be a gap of centuries between the cathedral-like caves of\nthe Thin Thal \xe2\x80\xa1 and of Kailash. \xc2\xa7 Yet even there we see the solitary figure of\nthe teaching or the meditating Buddha give place by degrees to a rich pantheon\nof devas and guardian kings. But the hope and delight that are expressed\n\np. 151\n\nso freely in the architecture and sculpture, and in the cosmopolitan\nintercourse of the Buddhist period die away imperceptibly into the rich\nimagery of the Puranic age, * and the manifold social and political problems\nof Sankaracharya and the age of chivalry.\n\nThe common tendency of Brahmins and yogis had been to hold out the\nemancipation of the whole nature through self-discipline as the goal of\nendeavour. This doctrine came to be regarded in a loose way as\ncharacteristically Hindu. The Buddhist conviction was, on the other hand, that\nthe same goal was to be reached, not so much by a gradual ripening of the\nself, as by ceasing from the illusion of egoism. Nirvana, not Mukti, became\nthe watchword. The fact that these two ideas are related to each other as the\nobverse and reverse of a coin, cannot have escaped the contemporary mind. But\nits own generation must have given a more antipodal value to the divergence\nthan is obvious to Western thought at the present day. It would seem to them\nto include all possible theological differences, and it is not unlikely that\nthis fact contributed largely to the belief so explicitly stated in the Gita,\nand so markedly Indian, that all religions express a single truth.\n\n\n\nIn the period of the Upanishads, the conception of Brahman--the one real\nappearing as many--had been reached. This implies the doctrine of Maya, or the\nillusion of things, as popularised under Buddhism. It is clear that in this\ntheory the whole question of the origin of evil is put aside. Evil and good\nare\n\np. 152\n\nalike shadows on the wall, cast by our sense of personal convenience in\nmagnified and distorted form. The saints recognise neither pain, insult, nor\nself-interest, being swallowed up in the joy of God.\n\n\n\nThe cyclic manifestation of the Cosmos--never created, but eternally self-\nexistent, self-destroying, self-repeating--was another idea sown broadcast by\nBuddhist teachers. Here we have an interpretation that is significant of the\nimmense scientific energy that has always gone hand in hand with Hindu\nreligious speculation, making the spirit of research inherent in the spirit of\ndevotion. Perhaps had orthodoxy offered the same resistance to science in the\nEast that it did in the West, Indian investigation would have appeared more\nimposing to-day in the eyes of foreigners. But the only thing that the Indian\npriesthood has conceived itself set to guard has been the social system. It\nhas opposed nothing save social aberrations. Knowledge has gone unhindered.\nAnd it will not be difficult to show that the much vaunted science of Moorish\nSpain was neither more nor less than the tapping of Indian culture for the\nmodern world.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps the most significant of all points in the Buddhist propaganda is\nits assumption that the word of the Blessed One Himself is all-sufficient\nauthority. Hinduism recognises only one proof, and that is direct perception.\nEven the sacred writings give as their sanction the direct perception of\nsaints and sages, and the Vedas themselves declare that man must reach beyond\nthe Vedas. That is to say, the books allege as their authority that\nrealisation out of which they were written. The Jains refuse the authority of\nthe Vedic texts. But there is less divergence between them and other sects of\n\np. 153\n\n[paragraph continues] Hinduism than would appear on the surface. Common\nlanguage and the historic acceptance of the race alike, lead up to the last\ngreat pronouncement on the subject--"By the Vedas no books are meant. They\nmean the accumulated treasury of spiritual laws discovered by different\npersons in different times."\n\n"It is Veda," we say in India of a statement which we perceive to be\nprofoundly true. It is held in a general way that there are two classes of\nScripture, one Vedas, the other Puranas. Vedas are eternal truth. Puranas are\ncharacterised by containing stories of the creation and destruction of the\nworld, tales of the life and death of holy persons and avatars, accounts of\ntheir miracles, and so on. These elements are commonly mixed up, but can\neasily be disentangled. Thus, when the Christian Gospel says, "Thou shalt love\nthe Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul," it speaks Veda;\nbut when it says, "Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod\nthe king" it is only a Puran, and may contain some elements of error.\n\nAnd so, if the word be rightly defined, it may he said that the Vedas\nthemselves are the sanction of Buddhism, of Mohammedanism, of Christianity,\nand of Confucianism; but it may at the same time be claimed on behalf of India\nthat there, and not in the West, has this fact been understood.\n\nSome of the greatest of French and English thinkers hold that the history of\nthe West is made into a unity by the evolution of science and its progressive\napplication to life, from the sixth century before Christ to the present day.\nThese thinkers maintain that Greece, Imperial Rome, and the Catholic Church\nhave been the three integral formative influences of what we call the European\nmind. To the student of Oriental history it appears\n\np. 154\n\nequally clear that the history of Asia is that of a single living organism, of\nwhich India may be taken as the heart and focus. Regarded thus, in relation to\nits surroundings, the culture to which we give the name of Indian thought\nbecomes likewise a unity, as clear, as continuous, as consistent in its\ndevelopment as is the evolution of the scientific idea in the West. Considered\nas an appanage of Europe, India is meaningless; taken in and for herself, and\nfor that to which she rightly belongs, it need not surprise us if we find her\nthe essential factor of human advance in the future as in the past.\n\nIII\n\nIndia is the heart of Asia. Hinduism is a convenient name for the nexus of\nIndian thought. It would appear that it takes some thousand to fifteen hundred\nyears to work out a single rhythm of its great pulsation. For this is about\nthe period that divides the war of the Mahabharata from Buddha, Buddha from\nSankaracharya, and Sankaracharya from Ramakrishna, in whom the immense pile\nreaches the crowning self-consciousness. Of the long prehistoric evolution\nthat went to the building up of Mahabharata, Great India, the heroic age, we\ncan say little, for nothing is left to us, save the legend of Sita and Rama,\nout of the night of time. Yet we [know](errata.htm#1) that this period must\nhave been long. Three thousand years seems not too much, if enough, to allow.\nBehind this again loom up the millenniums spent on the tableland of Central\nAsia, that headwater of world-civilisation where Aryan man entered the\npatriarchate, and closed the account of his first combat with Nature, having\ntamed the beasts, learned the use of tools, domesticated corn and fire,\n\np. 155\n\nproduced the fruit-trees, and divided the week. * Of the sublime dreams, the\npoetry and song with which he consoled himself during those ages of herculean\nstruggle, the fragments known as the "Rig Veda" still remain. And we learn\ntherein how broad was his outlook upon Nature, even as that of the mind that\ndeclared "and the evening and the morning were the first day." How long did it\nlast? Was it ten thousand years? Were there another five thousand before the\nwar of Mahabharata . . . . However this be, the enthusiasm of succeeding\nperiods strikes us as extraordinary.\n\nThere is no question that the characteristic product of the civilisation that\nsucceeded the Great War was the forest-universities, notes of whose sessions\nhave become the Sutras and Upanishads. But we must not forget also that during\nthe same period the Vedas was written down, and the searching scrutiny of\nsociety initiated which was later to result in those accumulations of reverent\nand sympathetic interpretations now known to us as the Laws of Manu.\n\nIt is only with difficulty that we realise the sense of vastness to which the\nthinkers of this period strove to give expression. The Celt, it has been said,\nstrives ever towards the infinite of emotion. The Hindu, in the same way,\ncannot rest content, short of the infinite of thought. We see this, even W so\nearly as the hymns of the Rig Veda. "When darkness was hidden in darkness,\nundistinguished, like one mass of Water," opens the great Anthem of Creation.\nStill larger is the sweep of the Upanishads--"they that see the Real in the\nmidst of this Unreal, they that behold life in the midst of this\n\np. 156\n\ndeath, they that know the One in all the changing manifoldness of this\nuniverse, unto _them_ belongs eternal peace--unto none else, unto none else."\nThe Vedas were the capital with which Aryan culture began its occupation of\nIndia, and these immense and subtle generalisations of the Upanishads\nrepresent the first achievement of the national mind in its new place. Surely\nthis is the secret of the striking fact in Indian history that all great eras\nof rejuvenescence, such as Sankaracharya\'s, and even minor movements of\nreconstruction like Guru Nanuk\'s, and Ramanuja\'s, have had to go back to the\nforest sutras and place themselves in structural continuity with them. In this\nlight we begin to suspect that the war of the Mahabharata itself represents\nthe apparent exhaustion of Vedic inspiration at the end of the first period,\nand the restoration of pristine vigour by force of Krishna\'s personality.\n\nThe twilight of Indian forests in the pre-Buddhistic age is resonant, to the\nhistoric ear, with chants and prayers. But the succeeding epoch leads us into\nthe busy life of villages and cities. For the ballads and songs of the people\nare crystallising now into the great Epics. Their religious activity--stirred\nby the sublime spectacle of a life that represents the whole of Upanishadic\nculture, the national dream in its completeness--occupies itself with\ngathering together, and weaving into a whole, all the religious ideas innate\namongst the masses, and those peculiar to the Indian environment. There is a\nsudden accession of force given to such practices as pilgrimage and relic-\nworship, and Brahmin intelligence is more or less unconsciously preoccupied\nwith the interpretation of images, symbols, and rituals, in relation to those\ntruths which had been the first realisation of the race. The distinction and\nlarger scope of this Buddhist period lay to a great\n\np. 157\n\nextent in its political, commercial, and sub-religious elements, in letters,\narts, and sciences.\n\nCertain evils must have come in the train of the ideas then elaborated,\nessential as they were to prove themselves in the long run to the completed\nfabric of Hinduism. We can understand that monastic notions may have attracted\ntoo much of the national energy out of the safe paths of domestic virtue, with\na tendency to bring about not only the depletion of family life, but the\ndisintegration of morality itself. No doubt it was at this time, and to meet\nthis error, that the song of the ideal sang itself so clearly, first through\nthe lips of Kalidas, * in his "Birth of the War-Lord," and again, in the final\nrecension of the Ramayana, as the love of Sita for Rama, that glorified\nwifehood, before which the renunciation and faith of the cloister grow pale.\n\nFrom the point of view of purity of doctrine, we can believe, too, that the\nvery breadth of the welcome extended to religious ideas of all kinds,\nespecially in the closing centuries of this age, had led to the undue\nemphasising of the popular notions, to the inclusion of an unnecessary\nmultiplicity of symbols, and possibly to the interpretation of symbols already\nexisting in rude or gross ways.\n\nBut agitation against abuses has never been the method of Hinduism. Rather has\nthe faith progressed by lifting repeatedly in moments of crisis the banner of\nthe highest ideal. Already, in the era we are considering, this organic law of\nthe national genius, the law of the avatars, was well known. "Whenever the\ndharmma decays, and when that which is not dharmma prevails, \xe2\x80\xa0 then I manifest\n\np. 158\n\nmyself. For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the evil _for\nthe firm establishment of the national righteousness_ , I am born again and\nagain." So says the Bhagavad Gita--and never was any prophecy more\nconclusively vindicated than this, by the appearance of Sankaracharya, early\nin the ninth century after Christ.\n\nThis wonderful boy--for he died at the age of thirty-two--was born at the end\nof the eighth century, and had already completed a great mission when most men\nare still dreaming of the future. The characteristic product of Oriental\nculture is always a commentary. By this form of literature the future is knit\nfirmly to the past, and though the dynamic power of the connecting idea may be\nobscure to the foreigner, it is clearly and accurately conveyed to the Eastern\nmind itself. The whole of Confucianism is contained in a commentary on the\nEking, or Book of Change, and European Protestantism might almost be described\nas a special kind of commentary on the Christian sacred literature. The\nSanskrit _sutras_ lend themselves to critical writing, and even demand it, in\na special degree: for the word _sutra_ means _thread_ , and is applied to\nworks which are only the main line of a given argument, and require expansion\nat the end of every sentence. This literary convention obtains in all Oriental\ncountries, and must date from the period When the main function of writing was\nto assist memorising. Obviously, by writing a new commentary on a given sutra,\nthe man of genius has it in his power to readjust the relationship between a\ngiven question and the whole of current opinion. Hence it is not surprising to\nfind that the masterpiece of Sankaracharya\'s life was a commentary on the\nVedanta-Sutra.\n\nThe problems which faced the Indian mind during his lifetime, with the single\nexception that the\n\np. 159\n\ncountry was then rich and prosperous, must have been curiously like those of\nthe present day, and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that in his eyes\nthey assumed national dimensions. Religious practices had lost their primitive\nsimplicity, and also perhaps their compelling power. Ideas as to national and\nunnational (for the word "orthodox" was but the Asiatic word for "national")\nwere conflicting and confused. Men lived much in the thought of the recent\nsectarian developments of the faith, and tended to lose sight of its austere\nimperative, pointing to the highest realisation, of its antiquity, and its\nclose-knit continuity. [Lakshmi](errata.htm#2), Goddess of Fortune, was one of\nthe chief objects of worship. Sects and kingdoms alike had lost their sense of\nmutual solidarity. Never perhaps was an Asiatic people nearer precipitating\nitself on a purely secular development.\n\nAt this moment the whole of the national genius awoke once more in\nSankaracharya. Amidst all the brilliance and luxury of the age, in spite of\nthe rich and florid taste of the Puranic period, his soul caught the mystic\nwhisper of the ancient rhythm of the Vedic chants, and the dynamic power of\nthe faith to lead the soul to super-consciousness, became for him the secret\nof every phase of Hinduism. He was on fire with the love of the Vedas. His own\npoems have something of their classical beauty and vigour, and his books may\nalmost be described as chains of quotations from the most piercing and\ncomprehensive sentences of the Upanishads, to which he has contributed links\nand rivets.\n\nSankaracharya wandered, during his short life, from his birthplace in the\nSouth as far as the Himalayas, and everything that he came across in his\ntravels related itself to the one focus and centre, in his mind. He accepted\neach worship, even that from which he was at first adverse, but always\n\np. 160\n\nbecause he found that the great mood of One-without-a-second was not only the\nVedic, but also the Puranic goal. This is the doctrine that he expresses in\nhis twelve epoch-making commentaries, especially in his crowning work, the\ncommentary on the Vedanta Sutra. And this idea, known as the Adwaita\nPhilosophy, constitutes, for the rest of the Hindu period, the actual unity of\nIndia.\n\nWestern people can hardly imagine a personality such as that of Sankaracharya.\nIn the course of so few years to have nominated the founders of no less than\nten great religious orders, of which four have fully retained their prestige\nto the present day; to have acquired such a mass of Sanskrit learning as to\ncreate a distinct philosophy, and impress himself on the scholarly imagination\nof India in a preeminence that twelve hundred years have not sufficed to\nshake; to have written poems whose grandeur makes them unmistakable, even to\nthe foreign and unlearned ear; and at the same time to have lived with his\ndisciples in all the radiant joy and simple pathos of the saints--this is\ngreatness that we may appreciate, but cannot understand. We contemplate with\nwonder and delight the devotion of Francis of Assisi, the intellect of\nAbelard, the force and freedom of Martin Luther, and the political efficiency\nof Ignatius Loyola; but who could imagine all these united in one person?\n\nSubsequent critics have painted Sankaracharya as the persecutor of Buddhists.\nInasmuch as he asserted a co-ordination of mythologies and doctrines, instead\nof preaching a single exclusive method of salvation; inasmuch as to him the\ngoal was a positive, and not a negative affirmation, and in so far also as he\ninsisted upon the worthlessness of ritual apart from philosophy, of worship\nwithout illumination, he may be taken as the enemy of one school or another.\nIt is almost unnecessary to add that this\n\np. 161\n\nenmity was purely controversial in its character, and to Buddhists of the\nNorthern School, a clearer historic knowledge will reveal him as the very\nopposite of a persecutor, as, rather, another example of the race of inspired\nreligious teachers to which their own apostle, Nagarjuna, belonged. *\n\nBuddhism as a whole, with the succeeding Puranism, had been the creation of\nthe lay mind, the creation of the people. The work of Sankaracharya was the\nrelinking of popular practice to the theory of Brahman, the stern infusion of\nmythological fancies with the doctrine of the Upanishads. He took up and\ndefined the current catchwords--maya, karma, reincarnation, and others--and\nleft the terminology of Hinduism what it is to-day. At the same time, we must\nnot neglect to remind ourselves that in all this, if he had been other than\nthe expression of that which it was the actual tendency of the race to\nformulate, he would not have found the scope he did. The recognition of a\ngreat man is as essential a factor in his history as his own power and\ncharacter. His complete appropriation by his nation only shows that he is in\nperfect unison with its thought and aspiration.\n\nThe two or three centuries immediately succeeding Sankaracharya are commonly\nknown as the dark ages of Indian history. The application of the term is\nobscure. In what sense were these ages dark? They were centuries of chivalric\ndominance, and in many a Rajput line the bardic annals are still preserved\nthat will one day enable a generation of Indian historians to read their\nrecord. Even the wars of such a period were never destructive; for, apart from\ntheir specially chivalrous character, Oriental\n\np. 162\n\nmilitary usage has always secured the safety of non-combatants. The lives of\nwater-carriers and commissariat servants were scrupulously respected in\nAsiatic warfare. It is said, indeed, that the European gipsy is an example of\nthis. These poor people were originally a tribe of petty merchants who used to\naccompany the march of armies. Wherever the camp was pitched, they could run\nup a bazaar in half an hour, and their caste-honour lay in telling neither\nside the secrets of the other. When Genghis Khan invaded Hungary, these\nparticular clans were carried there, never to return. *\n\nBut it was not only camp-followers who were protected by a law such as that\nwhich now defends the Red Cross Sisterhoods of Europe. A like consideration\nprevailed, with regard to the peasant working in the fields, and the craftsman\ntoiling at his anvil. The young crops were honoured in ancient combat, as\nwould be Cologne Cathedral or Notre Dame de Paris in modern. Under these\ncircumstances a battle became only a deadly form of tournament, involving in\nits peril none but fighting men.\n\nBut if such contests could not become destructive, neither could they succeed\nin educating the masses of the people to the common duty of military defence.\n\'This result could only be achieved when a religious idea should become the\nwar-cry of whole regions, conferring on all men the right of struggle without\ndistinction of caste. This right, so necessary to the completion of\nnationality, the Mohammedan invasion gave, and it is difficult to imagine any\nother way in which the lesson could have been widely learnt.\n\nThe great tide of vigour that emanated from Sankaracharya swept round India by\nsouth, west, and north, in a spiral curve. Ramanuja,\n\np. 163\n\n[paragraph continues] Madhavacharya, * Ram Das and Tukaram, \xe2\x80\xa0 the Sikh Gurus \xe2\x80\xa1\nand Gauranga, \xc2\xa7 were all in turn its products. Wherever it touched the\nMussulman consciousness, it created, chiefly by means of contest, a well-\ncentred nation. Where it did not come in contact with Mohammedanism, as in the\nextreme south, this spiritual energy did not succeed in evoking a nationality.\nAnd where it did not lead to definite fighting, as in Bengal under Chaitanya,\nthe sense of national existence remained more or less potential. Thus the\nadvent of Islam into India during the post-Sankaracharyan period cannot be\nregarded as a revolutionary invasion, inasmuch as under the new power there\nwas no loss of Asiatic modes. New arts of luxury were introduced, but the\ngeneral economic system remained undisturbed. India received a more\ncentralised government than had been possible since the Asokan Empire, but no\nnew forces came into operation, tending to reduce her own children to the\nposition of agricultural serfs or tenants. And we have seen that even the wars\nwhich arose between contiguous populations of Hindus and Mohammedans must be\nregarded rather as those athletic contests between brothers and cousins which\nconfer individuality, than as conquests on the one side or the other. The\nvictor after victory attempts neither to exclude his rival\'s creed from\n\np. 164\n\noffice, nor to create invidious distinctions. "The great bankers and nobles of\nBengal remained Hindu under the rule of the Nawabs, as naturally as the\nMussulman maintained his face in the shadow of a Hindu throne." *\n\nNor have the clearness and self-consciousness that its definition has added to\nHinduism in any way tended to impair its inclusiveness. For the personality\nthat the nineteenth century has revealed as the turning-point of the national\ndevelopment is that of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, \xe2\x80\xa0 whose name stands as another\nword for the synthesis of all possible ideals and all possible shades of\nthought. In this great life, Hinduism finds the philosophy of Sankaracharya\nclothed upon with flesh, and is made finally aware of the entire sufficiency\nof any single creed or conception to lead the soul to God as its true goal.\nHenceforth, it is not true that each form of life or worship is tolerated or\nunderstood by the Hindu mind: each form is justified, welcomed, set up for its\npassionate loving, for evermore. Henceforth, the supreme crime for the\nfollower of any Indian sect, whether orthodox or modern, philosophic or\npopular, shall be the criticism of any other, as if it were without the bounds\nof "the Eternal Faith" "Man proceeds from truth to truth, and not from error\nto truth," becomes in future the formula that constitutes belief.\n\nAt this point we could almost have prophesied, had it not already happened,\nthat some great disciple of this master would declare, on behalf of the whole\nnation, that the final differentia of Hinduism lay in the acceptance of the\ndoctrine of the _Istha Devata_ , _i.e._ , the right of every man to choose his\nown\n\np. 165\n\ncreed, and of none to force the same choice on any other. *\n\nAt last, then, Indian thought stands revealed in its entirety--no sect, but a\nsynthesis; no church, but a university of spiritual culture--as an idea of\nindividual freedom, amongst the most complete that the world knows. Certain\nconceptions, such as maya, karma, and reincarnation, popularised by Buddhism,\nand mukhti or the beatific vision, sown broadcast alike by Sankaracharya and\nthe Sufis, are characteristic of large areas. But they are nowhere and in no\nsense regarded as essential. For it is as foreign to the genius of Hinduism to\nrequire an oath of conformity to any given religious tenet whatever, as it\nwould be to the habits of an Oxford don to require adherence to the doctrines\nof Plato as against those of Aristotle. It would thus appear that the\nreforming sects of the Mohammedan period and of the nineteenth century itself,\nhave to the full as good a right to call themselves Hindu as the most orthodox\npriest of Siva, or the most learned Sanskrit pundit.\n\nWe have seen then, that it is certainly a mistake to read the history of India\nat any time as the account of a struggle between Hindu and Mohammedan thought,\nthough it is a mistake which is perhaps inseparable from the European\nconception of the influence of faith on politics. But it cannot, on the other\nhand, be too clearly understood that the problem which the Indian idea has had\nto face, during the period between Sankaracharya and the\n\np. 166\n\nnineteenth century, was the inclusion of the Mohammedan element in a completed\nnationality. From the nineteenth century onwards, it becomes the _realisation_\nof that single united nationality, amidst the vast complexity which has been\nthe growth of ages.\n\nIt is said that nations and systems of culture fulfil special functions, as\norgans of humanity just as individuals fulfil special uses in the community.\nIf this be so, it would almost appear that within the bounds of India lies one\nof the focal or polar points of the race. The great task of the reconciliation\nof opposites would seem to devolve on the peoples within this pale. It is not\nenough that the Mussulman should inhabit the pastoral belt, the Mongolian rest\nsecure behind the Thian Shan, and the Aryan and Dravidian dwell peacefully\nside by side in the Southern peninsula. It was decreed from the beginning, it\nlay unavoidably in the very nature of things, that sooner or later all these\nshould meet in the land of the Indus, and learn their mutual significance and\nresponsibilities. Buddhism may be regarded in one aspect as simply the\nsynthesis of Eastern Asia. Neo-Hinduism (to borrow a term which has been\ncoined in no friendly spirit) is equally indicative of a place found in Aryan\nthought for Semitic formulae, and who shall say what is yet to be born of that\nconjunction between all these, in which Asia shall find herself to be--not, as\nshe has so long been told, "merely a congeries of geographical fragments,"\nstill less a concert of rival political units, held in mechanical combination\nby a due admixture of mutual hopes and recriminations, but a single immense\norganism, filled with the tide of one strong pulsating life from end to end,\nfirm-rooted in the soil of common origins and common modes? The value which we\nmay attach to the prospect of this future will depend on the idea that\n\np. 167\n\nwe have already been able to form, of the place of Asia in the evolution of\nhumanity, but to those who foresee a future moralisation of international\nrelations it may well appear that this question is among the most important in\nthe world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[142:*](wil11.htm#fr_12) Sufi-ism.--A mystic set of Mohammedans.
