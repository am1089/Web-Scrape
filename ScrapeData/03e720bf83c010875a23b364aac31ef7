(On the soul's) having entered (into the highest light), there is\nmanifestation (of its own nature); (as we infer) from the word 'own.'\n\n'Thus does that serene being, having risen out of this body and entered into\nthe highest light, manifest itself by its own nature' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 12, 3).\nRegarding this text a doubt arises whether the Self 1 manifests itself through\nsome adventitious distinction--as the Self (of him who possesses the lower\nknowledge only) does in the world of the gods and other abodes of enjoyment--\nor only through its own Self.--The purvapakshin maintains that, as in other\nplaces, here also the manifestation takes place through some adventitious\ncharacteristic; because release also is a fruit (like other fruits, e.g.\nsvarga), and because 'manifestation' means as much as origination. If the\nmanifestation took place only through the Self's own nature, it would already\nappear in the Self's former states: for a thing's own nature is never absent\nfrom it. The Self therefore manifests itself by means of some adventitious\ndistinction.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. It manifests itself through its Self\nonly, not through any other attribute.--Why so?--On account of the word 'own'\nin the clause 'by its own nature.' For on the other view the qualification\nconveyed by 'own' would be unmeaning.--But may not the term 'own' merely\nindicate that that form belongs to that which manifests itself?--Not so, we\nreply. This is a point which would not require to be stated. For as in\n\np. 406\n\nwhatever form a thing manifests itself that form necessarily belongs to it,\nthe qualification 'own' would be devoid of purport. It has a meaning, on the\nother hand, if it denotes the Self, the sense conveyed then being that the\nmanifestation takes place only through the nature of the Self, not through any\nother, adventitious, nature.--But, as a thing cannot be without its own\nnature, what difference is there between the Self's former states and its\npresent state (after the manifestation)?--To this question the next Sutra\nreplies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[405:1](sbe38318.htm#fr_231) Sa _m_ prati _k_ aturthe pade paravidyaphalaikade\n_s_ o brahmabhavavirbhava _h_ , sagu _n_ avidyaphala _m_ _k_ a sarve _s_\nvaratulyabhogatvam avadharayishyate, tatraparavidyaprapyam uktva\nparavidyaprapyam aha sa _m_ padyeti. \xc3\x82n.
