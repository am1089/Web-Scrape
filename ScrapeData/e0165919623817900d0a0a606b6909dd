Godlike\nendowments are deemed to be (means) for\n\np. 115\n\nfinal emancipation, demoniac for bondage 1. Grieve not, O descendant of\nBharata! you are born to godlike endowments. (There are) two classes of\ncreated beings in this world, the godlike and the demoniac; the godlike\n(class) has been described at length; now hear from me, O son of P _ri_ tha!\nabout the demoniac. Demoniac persons know not action or inaction 2, neither\npurity nor yet (correct) conduct nor veracity are in them. They say the\nuniverse is devoid of truth 3, devoid of fixed principle 4, and devoid of a\nruler, produced by union (of male and female) caused by lust 5, and nothing\nelse. Holding this view, (these) enemies of the world, of ruined 6 selfs, of\nlittle knowledge, and of ferocious actions, are born for the destruction (of\nthe world). Entertaining insatiable desire, full of vanity, ostentatiousness,\nand frenzy, they adopt false notions 7 through delusion, and engage in unholy\nobservances. Indulging in boundless thoughts ending with death 8, given up to\nthe enjoyment of objects of desire, being resolved that that is all, bound\ndown by nets of hopes in hundreds, given up to anger and desire, they wish\n\np. 116\n\nto obtain heaps of wealth unfairly for enjoying objects of desire. 'This have\nI obtained to-day; this wish I will obtain; this wealth is mine; and this also\nshall be mine; this foe I have killed; others too I will destroy; I am lord, I\nam the enjoyer, I am perfect 1, strong, happy; I have wealth; I am of noble\nbirth; who else is like me? I will sacrifice 2; I will make gifts; I will\nrejoice.' Thus deluded by ignorance, tossed about by numerous thoughts,\nsurrounded by the net of delusion, and attached to the enjoyment of objects of\ndesire, they fall down into impure hell. Honoured (only) by themselves, void\nof humility, and full of the pride and frenzy of wealth, these calumniators\n(of the virtuous) perform sacrifices, which are sacrifices only in name, with\nostentatiousness and against prescribed rules 3; indulging (their) vanity,\nbrute force, arrogance, lust, and anger; and hating me in their own bodies and\nin those of others 4. These enemies 5, ferocious, meanest of men, and unholy,\nI continually hurl down, to these worlds 6, only into demoniac wombs. Coming\ninto demoniac wombs, deluded in every birth, they go down to the vilest state,\nO son of Kunti! without ever coming to me. Threefold is this way, to hell,--\n\np. 117\n\nruinous to the self [1](sbe0819.htm#fn_501),--lust, anger, and likewise\navarice; therefore one should abandon this triad. Released from these three\nways to darkness, O son of Kunti! a man works out his own welfare, and then\nproceeds to the highest goal. He [2](sbe0819.htm#fn_502) who abandoning\nscripture ordinances, acts under the impulse of desire, does not attain\nperfection [3](sbe0819.htm#fn_503), nor happiness, nor the highest goal.\nTherefore in discriminating between w hat should be done and what should not\nbe done, your authority (must. be) scripture. And knowing what is declared by\nthe ordinances of scripture, you should perform action in this world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[114:1](sbe0817.htm#fr_482) Cf.
