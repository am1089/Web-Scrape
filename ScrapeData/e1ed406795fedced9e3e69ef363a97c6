D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n\xc2\xa7 12\\. Brahma is \xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81.--I. _Upanishads._ --This idealistic conception became\nmore marked when Brahma was identified with the _\xc4\x80 tm\xc4\x81,_ the subject of\nindividual thought. "The universe is an Idea, _my_ Idea"--this doctrine is\nconstantly preached in detailed expositions and in pithy phrases like the\nfamous "I am Brahma" _(aham_ _brahm \xc4\x81smi)_, "thou art that" _(tat tvam asi)_.\nHence all phenomena are known when their substrate Brahma is known as the Self\nof the knower.\n\nFor _tat tvam asi_ see Ch. VI. viii. 7 f.; _aham brahm \xc4\x81smi,_ B.A. I. iv. 10;\ncf. _tad vai tat,_ "truly this is that," B.A. V. iv., _etad vai tat_ , Ka\xe1\xb9\xadh.\nIV. 3-6. The most adequate treatment of this theme is B.A. IV. iii.-iv.: the\nSelf is "the Spirit _(Purusha)_\n\np. 25\n\nmade of understanding amid the Breaths, the inward light within the heart,\nthat travels abroad, remaining the same, through both worlds," wandering in\nwaking and dreaming through this world, and in deep sleep or death through the\nworld of Brahma; in dreams it builds up a fairy world from the materials of\nwaking thought; in dreamless sleep it is merged in the "understanding self,"\n_pr \xc4\x81jna \xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81,_ viz. Brahma as universal subject of thought, without\nconsciousness of objects distinct from itself (cf. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 11, 15,18). \xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81 is pure\nconsciousness, Kau. III f.; as a purely intellectual force pervading all\nbeing, it is compared to salt dissolved in water, B.A. II. iv. 12, Ch. VI.\nxiii. \xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81 known, all is known, Ch. VI. i. f.; the later view of it as\nimpassive spectator of the subjects, objects, and activity of finite thought,\nPra. VI. 5, \xc5\x9avet. VI. 11, Sarvopanishats\xc4\x81ra, etc.\n\nCh. VIII. i. f. lays special emphasis on the presence of the whole macrocosm,\nthe universal Self, in the heart of man, and hence on the absolute freedom of\nhim who knows the Self within him. The whole world of cognitions exists for us\nonly in so far as it enters into the range of our egoity; our pleasures are\nonly for the satisfaction of our Self, which is the All; this recognition\nunites our soul with the universe and gives us control of all things from\ntheir source, B.A. II. iv., IV. v. The final reality of cognition is\ninfinitude, _bh \xc5\xabm\xc4\x81,_\n\np. 26\n\nillimitable ideation, on realising which the soul wins absolute freedom, Ch.\nVII. xxiii. f.\n\nVery important in this connection is the theory of the Five Selves propounded\nin the Taittir\xc4\xabya Upanishad, ii., an attempt to interpret the phenomena of\nphysical existence in terms of the \xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81. The author conceives the first four\nSelves as sheaths surrounding the fifth. The first is _anna-maya,_ "formed of\nfood"; that is, it comprises the physical organs of microcosmic and\nmacrocosmic body. Within this is the second, the _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a-maya,_ "formed of\nlife-breaths"; it is the Self as embodied in the incorporeal functions on\nwhich depends the activity of the gross organs in the microcosm and macrocosm.\nThe third is _mano-maya,_ "formed of will," namely of the Vedas and Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as,\nwhich are the powers inspiring the life of the world for worldly ends, for\nthey ordain rituals for the carnal benefit of gods and their worshippers in\nthis and other worlds. The fourth is _vijn \xc4\x81na-maya,_ "formed of\nunderstanding," namely that phase of consciousness in which the vanity of this\nVedic ritual is recognised and superseded by an intellectual worship of\nBrahma, which however still distinguishes Brahma as object from the Self as\nworshipper. Within this is the inmost Self, the _\xc4\x81 nanda-maya,_ "formed of\nbliss," the incogitable spirit of infinite peace and joy (cf. Ch. IV. x.-xv.,\nwhere Brahma is essentially space and joy).\n\np. 27\n\nII. _Later Ved \xc4\x81nta._--The triad of attributes often mentioned in the later\nVed\xc4\x81nta, Existence, Thought, and Bliss _(sack-chid- \xc4\x81nanda)_, does not occur\nas a formula in \xc5\x9aankara\'s writings; it is however anticipated by his\ndefinition of Brahma as "eternal, omniscient, omnipresent, eternally\nsatisfied, eternally pure, intelligent, and free of nature, understanding, and\nbliss" (on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra I. i. 4). Brahma is the omnipotent and omniscient\ncause of the origin, maintenance, and dissolution of the universe, the\nintelligence forming the Self or true Ego of every being, of which the only\npossible predicates are absolute Being and Thought (on I. i. 2, 4, II. iii. 7,\nIII. ii. 21, etc.).\n\nIn accordance with his principles, \xc5\x9aankara regards the creation by and from\nBrahma from both an esoteric and an exoteric standpoint. On the one hand, he\nremarks, the creation of the phenomenal world as described in terms of empiric\nthought by the Vedas and Upanishads has no absolute reality at all; it is\nintended to teach parabolically that the Self of all things is Brahma (see\ncommentary on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra II. i. 33). On the other hand, the world of\nexperience cannot be ignored altogether; it is a fact of consciousness, though\nonly of unenlightened consciousness, and accordingly an explanation of its\nprocess must be found. Creation consists in a division of Brahma by himself\ninto a boundless variety of "names and forms," intelligible existences\n\np. 28\n\nwhich constitute the empiric world and possess determinate principles of\nbeing, formal and material potentialities _( \xc5\x9bakti)_ that never vary\nthroughout all the world\'s successive cycles (see \xc2\xa7 23). These potential\nforces, which relatively to one another are of infinite variety but\nintrinsically are strictly determinate, include not only the germinal\nprinciples of all phenomena but also the empiric souls _(j \xc4\xabva) _as such; and\ncollectively they constitute the "powers" or _\xc5\x9b aktis,_ i.e. the eternal\ndemiurgic potencies of Brahma, which in the intervals between the creations of\nthe worlds lie dormant in a deep sleep of illusion as a sum of merely\npotential energies, waiting for the next creation to arise in cosmopoeic\nactivity (on I. iii. 30, IV. 9, II, i. 30 f., etc.). Thus the Upanishadic\ntheory of a single creation is replaced by a doctrine of beginningless and\nendless successions of emergence and reabsorption of the phenomenal world (see\n\xc2\xa7 23).\n\nThe force that moves the absolute Idea to conceive itself as a plurality of\ndeterminate subjects and objects of empiric thought is, according to \xc5\x9aankara,\n_Ignorance,_ which, though itself strictly negative, is the basis of that\npositive illusion, the phenomenal world (see \xc2\xa7 16). Ignorance creates\n"determinations," _up \xc4\x81dhi,_ modes of thought limiting the self-conception of\nthe absolute Brahma, and Ignorance causes the empiric soul thus produced to\nconfuse Brahma with the determinations\n\np. 29\n\nfalsely imposed upon him, so that Brahma is imagined variously as individual\nsoul, a world of experience, and a personal God.\n\nThe "determinations" that play the most important part in \xc5\x9aankara\'s system are\nthose which form the structure of individual consciousness by constituting the\nidea of an embodied individual soul, _j \xc4\xabva._ These are the _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as,_ or\n"breaths," the "works," the "subtle body," the gross body, and sometimes also\nthe sensations and phenomenal perceptions (see \xc2\xa7 18). A favourite metaphor by\nwhich Sankara illustrates his theory of _up \xc4\x81dhis_ is that of a jar. The space\nenclosed within a certain jar is really the same as the infinite space filling\nthe universe, and the conception of it as limited by the jar nowise limits the\ninfinitude of space itself; and so the conception of the Self as determined by\nthe forms of embodied existence nowise excludes the identity of the embodied\nSelf with the absolute Brahma. The soul itself, says \xc5\x9aankara (on II. iii. 40),\nis totally incapable of (empiric) action, whether as subject or object; its\napparent activity, e.g. in desire, grief, etc., is based merely upon\nIgnorance, for the activity arises because the soul falsely ascribes to itself\nthe properties of "determinations" (cf. the definitions of the individual soul\ngiven on IV. ii. 4 as "the intelligent self, _vijn \xc4\x81n\xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81,_ having the\ndeterminations of ignorance, works, and previous experience").\n\nThe Vedantic schools which followed \xc5\x9aankara\n\np. 30\n\ntheorised more schematically on the origin of the phenomenal world. They\nregard Ignorance as a cosmic sum of forces including all finite powers,\ncauses, and effects, which has two characteristic properties, viz.\n"obscuration" _( \xc4\x81vara\xe1\xb9\x87a)_, causing the Absolute Idea to conceive itself as\ndistinct individual egos, and "distention" _(vikshepa)_ , arousing in the Self\nthe illusive idea of an external world of phenomena. Accepting the S\xc4\x81nkhya\'s\ndivision of matter into the three _gu \xe1\xb9\x87as_ or modes of _sattva_ ("goodness" or\n"truth"), _rajas_ ("passion"), and _tamas_ ("gloom"), they identify matter\nwith Cosmic Ignorance, or the sum of individual Ignorances, which acts as a\n"determinant" to the Supreme Self or Absolute Thought. The latter as\n"determined" in Cosmic Ignorance acts as a world-soul, directing the universal\norder of phenomena with supreme power and knowledge, and hence is called _\xc4\xaa\n\xc5\x9bvara,_ "the Lord." The Cosmic Ignorance is hence called "\xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara\'s body," and\nalso "Deep Sleep" _(sushupti)_ , for in it the force of Ignorance investing\nThought is almost wholly inoperative, and the phenomenal world exists only in\npotentiality. This sphere of being is called the "sheath of Bliss," _\xc4\x81 nanda-\nmaya ko\xc5\x9ba._ To it corresponds a stage of existence in the individual soul, in\nwhich the Self or Thought (here styled _Pr \xc4\x81jna_) is "determined" by\nindividual Ignorance. From \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara as "determined" by Cosmic Ignorance arise\nthe subtle\n\np. 31\n\nelements (\xc2\xa7 18) and thence both the "subtle bodies" (\xc2\xa7 19) and gross elements.\nThe "subtle bodies" in the aggregate determine the Self into a mode called _Pr\n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a,_ _S \xc5\xabtr\xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81,_ or _Hira \xe1\xb9\x87yagarbha_; individually they determine it into\nthe mode called _Taijasa._ These combinations of matter with the Self form\nthree successive phases of being for the individual soul: (1) the "sheath of\nunderstanding," _vijn \xc4\x81na-maya ko\xc5\x9ba,_ composed of intelligence _(buddhi)_ and\nthe "organs of knowledge" (\xc2\xa7 18), which constitutes the real _agent_ in\nempiric experience; (2) the "sheath of mind," _mano-maya ko \xc5\x9ba,_ formed of\n_manas_ and the organs of action, thus constituting the _instrument_ of\nempiric experience; and (3) the "sheath of the breaths," _pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a-maya ko\xc5\x9ba,_\nformed of vital breaths and organs of action, and constituting the effect of\nexperience. These three phases of being are together called "Dream-Sleep," as\nin them arise the subtle or elementary forms of phenomena and the reflection\nof them upon the "determined" Self. The gross elements which arise from the\nsubtle collectively "determine" the Self into the phase called _Vai \xc5\x9bv\xc4\x81nara_\nor _Vir \xc4\x81t_; individually they "determine" it into _Vi \xc5\x9bva_. This lowest\ndetermination is called _anna-maya ko \xc5\x9ba,_ the "sheath of food," or the state\nof Waking, for into it the forms of both gross and subtle phenomena are\ndisplayed to the Self, as in waking both memory and sense-perception are\nactive.\n\np. 32\n\nThe scheme is thus as follows:\n\n1\\. Individual Gross Body, determinant of Vi\xc5\x9bva, in state of Waking.\n\n|\n\nSheath of Food.\n\n|\n\nCosmic Gross Body determinant of Vir\xc4\x81t, in state of Waking.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n2\\. Individual Subtle Body, determinant of Taijasa, in state of Dreaming.\n\n|\n\n(1) Sheath of Breaths.  \n(2) Sheath of Mind.  \n(3) Sheath of Understanding.\n\n|\n\nCosmic Subtle Body, determinant of Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, in state of Dreaming.  \n  \n3\\. Individual Causal Body, determinant of Pr\xc4\x81jna, in state of Dreamless\nSleep.\n\n|\n\nSheath of Bliss.\n\n|\n\nCosmic Causal Body, determinant of \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara, in state of Dreamless Sleep.  \n  \n* * *\n\n[Next: Brahma is Incogitable](brk16.htm)\n\n'
