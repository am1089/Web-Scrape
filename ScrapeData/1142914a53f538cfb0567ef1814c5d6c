At this time the\nthunder of the clouds was like the sounds of drums; and the clouds, of\ndifferent colours, which were collected together, were brave and resolute\nheroes. In the midst of these the flashing of the lightning was as the\nglittering of arms. Here and there rows of cranes in their flight looked like\nwhite flags: frogs and peacocks sung praises, like bards, who accompany\narmies, and the continued rain fell in large drops like arrows.\n\nBeholding the rainy season approach in this splendid style, the hot season\nabandoned the plains, and ran off with its life. Then the lord of the clouds,\nhaving rained upon the earth, conferred gladness upon it. She (the earth)\nhaving performed penance during eight months\' separation from her lord, now\ncompensated herself by enjoyment.\n\nHer breasts came down and became cold. She was pregnant, and had eighteen\nsons; who, taking presents of fruits and flowers, went to pay respects to\ntheir father. The land of Brindabun\n\np. 72\n\nappeared as beautiful at that time as a loving woman, adorned with ornaments.\nAnd on all sides the rivers, nullahs and tanks were full; on which were\nwaterfowl of different kinds, adding beauty to the scene. The branches of\nlofty trees were waiving to and fro; and on them cuckoos, pigeons, parrots and\nother birds were pouring forth their mingled notes. And here and there the\ncowherdesses and cowherds, dressed in red and yellow dresses, and swinging,\nwere singing melodies in high notes. Approaching them, Shree Krishnu and\nBulram afforded them great pleasure by engaging in, and exhibiting, their\nyouthful sports. In this delightful manner the rainy season passed away; then\nShree Krishnu began to say to the cowherds\' children, "Brothers! the pleasure-\ngiving surud season has now come. Now all, I know, will enjoy great pleasure;\nnow is the season of enjoyment and fine weather. The stars by night shine in\nthe sky, brilliant as the passionless Bruhmu. For four months we have remained\nin the house; now that the surud season has come, let us give up all love for\nit, (the house). People run to and fro, occupied with their respective\naffairs. Princes proceed to conquer foreign countries."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXII](psa23.htm)\n\n'
