I was startled.\n\n"Who did you say had sent for me?" I asked the messenger.\n\n"The Rani Mother."\n\n"The Bara Rani?"\n\n"No, sir, the Chota Rani Mother."\n\nThe Chota Rani! It seemed a century since I had been sent for by her. I kept\nthem all waiting there, and went off into the inner apartments. When I stepped\ninto our room I had another shock of surprise to find Bimala there with a\ndistinct suggestion of being dressed up. The room, which from persistent\nneglect had latterly acquired an air of having grown absent-minded, had\nregained something of its old order this afternoon. I stood there silently,\nlooking enquiringly at Bimala.\n\nShe flushed a little and the fingers of her right hand toyed for a time with\nthe bangles on her left arm. Then she abruptly broke the silence. "Look here!\nIs it right that ours should be the only market in all Bengal which allows\nforeign goods?"\n\n"What, then, would be the right thing to do?" I asked.\n\n"Order them to be cleared out!"\n\n"But the goods are not mine."\n\n"Is not the market yours?"\n\n"It is much more theirs who use it for trade."\n\n"Let them trade in Indian goods, then."\n\n"Nothing would please me better. But suppose they do not?"\n\n"Nonsense! How dare they be so insolent? Are you not ..."\n\n"I am very busy this afternoon and cannot stop to argue it out. But I must\nrefuse to tyrannize."\n\n"It would not be tyranny for selfish gain, but for the sake of the country."\n\n"To tyrannize for the country is to tyrannize over the country. But that I am\nafraid you will never understand." With this I came away.\n\nAll of a sudden the world shone out for me with a fresh clearness. I seemed to\nfeel it in my blood, that the Earth had lost the weight of its earthiness, and\nits daily task of sustaining life no longer appeared a burden, as with a\nwonderful access of power it whirled through space telling its beads of days\nand nights. What endless work, and withal what illimitable energy of freedom!\nNone shall check it, oh, none can ever check it! From the depths of my being\nan uprush of joy, like a waterspout, sprang high to storm the skies.\n\nI repeatedly asked myself the meaning of this outburst of feeling. At first\nthere was no intelligible answer. Then it became clear that the bond against\nwhich I had been fretting inwardly, night and day, had broken. To my surprise\nI discovered that my mind was freed from all mistiness. I could see everything\nrelating to Bimala as if vividly pictured on a camera screen. It was palpable\nthat she had specially dressed herself up to coax that order out of me. Till\nthat moment, I had never viewed Bimala\'s adornment as a thing apart from\nherself. But today the elaborate manner in which she had done up her hair, in\nthe English fashion, made it appear a mere decoration. That which before had\nthe mystery of her personality about it, and was priceless to me, was now out\nto sell itself cheap.\n\nAs I came away from that broken cage of a bedroom, out into the golden\nsunlight of the open, there was the avenue of bauhinias, along the gravelled\npath in front of my verandah, suffusing the sky with a rosy flush. A group of\nstarlings beneath the trees were noisily chattering away. In the distance an\nempty bullock cart, with its nose on the ground, held up its tail aloft--one\nof its unharnessed bullocks grazing, the other resting on the grass, its eyes\ndropping for very comfort, while a crow on its back was pecking away at the\ninsects on its body.\n\nI seemed to have come closer to the heartbeats of the great earth in all the\nsimplicity of its daily life; its warm breath fell on me with the perfume of\nthe bauhinia blossoms; and an anthem, inexpressibly sweet, seemed to peal\nforth from this world, where I, in my freedom, live in the freedom of all\nelse.\n\nWe, men, are knights whose quest is that freedom to which our ideals call us.\nShe who makes for us the banner under which we fare forth is the true Woman\nfor us. We must tear away the disguise of her who weaves our net of\nenchantment at home, and know her for what she is. We must beware of clothing\nher in the witchery of our own longings and imaginings, and thus allow her to\ndistract us from our true quest.\n\nToday I feel that I shall win through. I have come to the gateway of the\nsimple; I am now content to see things as they are. I have gained freedom\nmyself; I shall allow freedom to others. In my work will be my salvation.\n\nI know that, time and again, my heart will ache, but now that I understand its\npain in all its truth, I can disregard it. Now that I know it concerns only\nme, what after all can be its value? The suffering which belongs to all\nmankind shall be my crown.\n\nSave me, Truth! Never again let me hanker after the false paradise of\nIllusion. If I must walk alone, let me at least tread your path. Let the drum-\nbeats of Truth lead me to Victory.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII](hw28.htm)\n\n'
