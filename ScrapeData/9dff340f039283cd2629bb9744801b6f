V.\n\nOf the seven regions of Patala, below the earth. Narada\'s praises of Patala.\nAccount of the serpent \xc5\x9aesha. First teacher of astronomy and astrology.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The extent of the surface of the earth has been thus described to\nyou, Maitreya. Its depth below the surface is said to be seventy thousand\nYojanas, each of the seven regions of Patala extending downwards ten thousand.\nThese seven, worthy Muni, are called Atala, Vitala, Nitala, Gabhastimat,\nMahatala, Sutala, and Patala 1. Their soil is severally white, black, purple,\nyellow, sandy, stony, and of gold. They are embellished with magnificent\npalaces, in which dwell numerous Danavas, Daityas, Yakshas, and great snake-\ngods. The Muni Narada, after his return from those regions to the skies 2,\ndeclared amongst the celestials that Patala was much more delightful than\nIndra\'s heaven. "What," exclaimed the sage, "can be compared to Patala, where\nthe Nagas are decorated with brilliant and beautiful and pleasure-shedding\njewels? who will not delight in Patala, where the lovely daughters of the\nDaityas and Danavas wander about, fascinating even the most austere; where the\nrays of the sun diffuse light, and not heat, by day; and where the moon shines\nby night for illumination, not for cold; where the sons of Danu, happy in the\nenjoyment of delicious viands and strong wines, know not how time passes?\nThere are beautiful groves and streams and lakes where the lotus blows; and\nthe skies are resonant with the Koil\'s song. Splendid ornaments, fragrant\nperfumes, rich unguents, the blended music of the lute and pipe and tabor;\nthese and many other enjoyments are the common portion of the Danavas,\nDaityas, and snake-gods, who inhabit the regions of Patala 3."\n\np. 205\n\nBelow the seven Patalas is the form of Vishn\xcc\x81u, proceeding from the quality of\ndarkness, which is called \xc5\x9aesha 4, the excellencies of which neither Daityas\nnor Danavas can fully enumerate. This being is called Ananta by the spirits of\nheaven, and is worshipped by sages and by gods. He has a thousand heads, which\nare embellished with the pure and visible mystic sign 5: and the thousand\njewels in his crests give light to all the regions. For the benefit of the\nworld he: deprives the Asuras of their strength. He rolls his eyes fiercely,\nas if intoxicated. He wears a single ear-ring, a diadem, and wreath upon each\nbrow; and shines like the white mountains topped with flame. He is clothed in\npurple raiment, and ornamented with a white necklace, and looks like another\nKailasa, with the heavenly Ganga flowing down its precipices. In one hand he\nholds a plough, and in the other a pestle; and he is attended by Varun\xcc\x81i (the\ngoddess of wine), who is his own embodied radiance. From his mouths, at the\nend of the Kalpa, proceeds the venomed fire that, impersonated as Rudra, who\nis one with Balarama, devours the three worlds.\n\np. 206\n\n\xc5\x9aesha bears the entire world, like a diadem, upon his head, and he is the\nfoundation on which the seven Patalas rest. His power, his glory, his form,\nhis nature, cannot be described, cannot he comprehended by the gods\nthemselves. Who shall recount his might, who wears this whole earth, like a\ngarland of flowers, tinged of a purple dye by the radiance of the jewels of\nhis crests. When Ananta, his eyes rolling with intoxication, yawns, then\nearth, with all her woods, and mountains, and seas, and rivers, trembles.\nGandharbas, Apsarasas, Siddhas, Kinnaras, Uragas, and Charan\xcc\x81as are unequal to\nhymn his praises, and therefore he is called the infinite (Ananta), the\nimperishable. The sandal paste, that is ground by the wives of the snake-gods,\nis scattered abroad by his breath, and sheds perfume around the skies.\n\nThe ancient sage Garga 6, having propitiated \xc5\x9aesha, acquired from him a\nknowledge of the principles of astronomical science, of the planets, and of\nthe good and evil denoted by the aspects of the heavens.\n\nThe earth, sustained upon the head of this sovereign serpent, supports in its\nturn the garland of the spheres, along with their inhabitants, men, demons,\nand gods.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[204:1](vp063.htm#fr_649) In the Bhagavata and Padma P. they are named Atala,\nVitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala, and Patala. The Vayu has\nRasatala, Sutala, Vitala, Gabhastala, Mahatala, \xc5\x9aritala, and Patala. There are\nother varieties.\n\n[204:2](vp063.htm#fr_650) Allusion is here made, perhaps, to the description\ngiven in the Mahabharata, Udyoga Parva, p. 218, of Narada\'s and Matali\'s visit\nto Patala. Several of the particulars there given are not noticed in the\nPuran\xcc\x81as.\n\n[204:3](vp063.htm#fr_651) There is no very copious description of Patala in\nany of the Puran\xcc\x81as. The most circumstantial are those of the Vayu and\nBhagavata: the latter has been repeated, p. 205 with some additions, in the\nfirst chapters of the Patala Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Padma Puran\xcc\x81a. The Mahabharata\nand these two Puran\xcc\x81as assign different divisions to the Danavas, Daityas, and\nNagas; placing Vasuki and the other Naga chiefs in the lowest: but the Vayu\nhas the cities of the principal Daityas and Nagas in each; as in the first,\nthose of the Daitya Namuchi, and serpent Kaliya; in the second, of Hayagriva\nand Takshaka; in the third, of Prahlada and Hemaka; in the fourth, of Kalanemi\nand Vainateya; in the fifth, of Hiran\xcc\x81yaksha and Kirmira; and in the sixth, of\nPuloman and Vasuki: besides others. Bali the Daitya is the sovereign of\nPatala, according to this authority. The Mahabharata places Vasuki in\nRasatala, and calls his capital Bhogavati. The regions of Patala, and their\ninhabitants, are oftener the subjects of profane, than of sacred fiction, in\nconsequence of the frequent intercourse between mortal heroes and the Naga-\nkanyas, or serpent-nymphs. A considerable section of the Vrihat Katha, the\nSuryaprabha lambaka, consists of adventures and events in this subterraneous\nworld.\n\n[205:4](vp063.htm#fr_652) \xc5\x9aesha is commonly described as being in this\nsituation: he is the great serpent on which Vishn\xcc\x81u sleeps during the\nintervals of creation, and upon whose numerous heads the world is supported.\nThe Puran\xcc\x81as, making him one with Balarama or Sankarshana, who is an\nimpersonation or incarnation of \xc5\x9aesha, blend the attributes of the serpent and\nthe demigod in their description.\n\n[205:5](vp063.htm#fr_653) With the Swastika, a particular diagram used in\nmystical ceremonies.\n\n[206:6](vp063.htm#fr_654) One of the oldest writers on astronomy amongst the\nHindus. According to Mr. Bentley, his Sanhita dates 548 B. C. (Ancient Astron.\nof the Hindus, p. 59.)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VI](vp064.htm)\n\n'
