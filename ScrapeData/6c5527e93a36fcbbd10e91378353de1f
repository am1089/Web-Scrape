Was his wife his or the other\nman\'s?\n\nSo the king went back as before under the sissoo tree, put the goblin on his\nshoulder, and started toward the monk. And as he walked along, the goblin told\nthe king a story.\n\n\n\nThere was a city called Shivapur in Nepal. Long ago a king named Glory-banner\nlived there, and he deserved the name. He laid the burden of government on his\ncounsellor named Ocean-of-Wisdom, and devoted himself to a life of pleasure\nwith his wife Moonbright.\n\nIn course of time a daughter named Moonlight was born to them, pleasing as the\nmoonlight to the eyes of men. When she grew up, she went one day in spring\nwith her servants to a festival in the garden.\n\nThere she was seen by a Brahman youth named Master-mind, the son of Rich, who\nhad come there to the festival. When he saw her plucking flowers with one arm\nuplifted, he went mad with love. His heart was taken captive by the gay\nmaiden, and he was no longer master of his mind.\n\nHe thought: "Is she the goddess of love, plucking the spring flowers in\nperson? Or is she a forest goddess, come here to worship the spring-time?"\n\nThen the princess saw him, like a new god of love incarnate. The moment her\neyes fell on him, she fell in love, forgetting her flowers and even her own\nlimbs. While they looked at each other, lost in love like people in a picture,\na great wail of anguish arose. They lifted their heads to learn what the\nmatter was, and just then an elephant that had broken his chain, maddened by\nthe scent of another mad elephant, came by, crushing the people in his path.\nHe had thrown off his driver and the ankus hung from him as he ran. And\neveryone fled in terror.\n\nBut the youth Master-mind ran up in a hurry and took the princess in his arms.\nAnd with a mixture of fear and love and modesty she half embraced him as he\ncarried her far out of the elephant\'s path. Then her people gradually\ngathered, and she went to the palace, looking at the youth, and burning over\nthe flame of love.\n\nAnd the youth went home from the garden, and thought: "I cannot live, I cannot\nexist a moment without her. I must seek help from my teacher Root, who is a\nthorough rogue." And so the day slowly passed.\n\nThe next morning he went to his teacher Root, and found him with his constant\nfriend Moon. He drew near, bowed, and told his desire. And the teacher laughed\nand promised to help him.\n\nSo that wonderful rogue put a magic pill in his mouth, and thus changed\nhimself into an old Brahman. He put a second pill into Master-mind\'s mouth,\nwhich changed him into a lovely girl. Then that prince of rogues took him to\nthe king and said: "O King, this maiden has come a long distance to marry my\nonly son. But my son has gone away, and I am going to look for him. Please\nkeep the girl. For you are a protector to be trusted while I am looking for my\nson."\n\nThe king was afraid of a curse, so he promised to do it. And summoning his\ndaughter, he said: "Daughter, keep this maiden in your chamber, and let her\nlive with you." So the girl took the Brahman youth Master-mind in his girl\nform to her own apartments.\n\nWhen Root had gone away, Master-mind in his girl form lived with his beloved,\nand in a few days came to know her in an intimate and loving way, as girl\nfriends do. Then when he saw that she was pining away and tossing on her\ncouch, he asked the princess one evening: "My dear girl, why do you grow pale\nand thin day by day, grieving as if separated from your love? Tell me. Why not\ntrust a loving, innocent girl like me? If you will not tell me, I shall starve\nmyself."\n\nAnd the princess trusted him and said after a little hesitation: "My dear\ngirl, why should I not trust you? Listen. I will tell you. One day I went to\nthe spring festival in the garden. There I saw a handsome Brahman youth, fair\nas the moon but not so cold, the sight of whom kindled my love. For he adorned\nthe garden as the spring-time does. While my eager eyes were feasting on his\nface, a great mad elephant that had broken his chain came charging and\nthundering past like a black cloud in the dry season. My servants scattered in\nterror, and I was helpless. But the Brahman youth took me in his arms and\ncarried me far away. I seemed to be in a sandal bath, in a stream of nectar. I\ncannot tell how I felt as I touched him. Presently my servants gathered\naround, and I was brought here helpless. I felt as if I had fallen from heaven\nto earth. From that day I see in my thoughts my dear preserver beside me. I\nembrace him in my dreams. What need of more words? I wear away the time,\nthinking constantly of him and only him. The fire of separation from the lord\nof my life devours me day and night."\n\nWhen Master-mind heard these welcome words, he rejoiced and counted himself\nhappy. And thinking the time to reveal himself had come, he took the pill from\nhis mouth, and disclosed his natural form. And he said: "Beautiful maiden, I\nam he whom you bought and enslaved with a kindly glance in the garden. I was\nsick at the separation from you; so I took the form of a girl, and came here.\nSo now bring heaven in a loving glance to my love-tortured heart."\n\nWhen the princess saw that the lord of her life was beside her, she was torn\nbetween love and wonder and modesty, and did not know what she ought to do. So\nthey were secretly married and lived there in supreme happiness. Master-mind\nlived in a double form. By day he was a girl with the pill in his mouth, by\nnight a man without the pill.\n\nAfter a time the brother-in-law of King Glory-banner gave his daughter with\ngreat pomp to a Brahman, the son of the counsellor Ocean-of-Wisdom. And the\nprincess Moonlight was invited to her cousin\'s wedding and went to her uncle\'s\nhouse. And Master-mind went with her in his girl form.\n\nWhen the counsellor\'s son saw Master-mind in his lovely girl form, he was\nterribly smitten with the arrows of love. His heart was stolen by the sham\ngirl, and he went home feeling lonely even with his wife. It made him crazy to\nthink of that lovely face. When his father tried to soothe him, he woke from\nhis madness and stammered out his insane desire. And his father was terribly\ndistressed, knowing that all this depended on another.\n\nThen the king learned the story and came there. When the king saw his\ncondition and perceived that he was seven parts gone in love, he said: "How\ncan I give him the girl who was intrusted to me by the Brahman? Yet without\nher he will be ten parts gone in love, and will die. And if he dies, then his\nfather, the counsellor, will die too. And if the counsellor perishes, my\nkingdom will perish. What shall I do?"\n\nHe consulted his counsellors, and they said: "Your Majesty, the first duty of\na king is the preservation of the virtue of his people. This is the\nfundamental principle, and is established as such among counsellors. If the\ncounsellor is lost, the fundamental principle is lost; how then can virtue be\npreserved? So in this case it would be sinful to destroy the counsellor\nthrough his son. You must by all means avoid the loss of virtue which would\nensue. Give the Brahman\'s girl to the counsellor\'s son. And when the Brahman\nreturns, further measures will suggest themselves."\n\nTo this the king agreed, and promised to give the sham girl to the\ncounsellor\'s son. So Master-mind in his girl form was brought from the chamber\nof the princess, and he said to the king: "Your Majesty, I was brought here by\nsomebody for a given purpose. If you give me to somebody else, well and good.\nYou are the king. Right and wrong depend on you. I will marry him to-day, but\nonly on one condition. My husband shall go away immediately after the marriage\nand not return until he has been on a pilgrimage for six months. Otherwise I\nshall bite out my tongue."\n\nSo the counsellor\'s son was summoned, and he joyfully assented. He made the\nman his wife at once, put the sham wife in a guarded room and started on a\npilgrimage. So Master-mind lived there in his woman form.\n\nWhen he realized that the counsellor\'s son would soon return, Master-mind fled\nby night. And Root heard the story, and again assumed the form of an old\nBrahman. He took his friend Moon, went to Glory-banner, and said respectfully:\n"Your Majesty, I have brought my son. Pray give me my daughter-in-law."\n\nThe king was afraid of a curse, so he said: "Brahman, I do not know where your\ndaughter-in-law has gone. Be merciful. To atone for my carelessness, I will\ngive your son my own daughter."\n\nThe prince of rogues in the form of an old Brahman angrily refused. But the\nking finally persuaded him, and with all due form married his daughter\nMoonlight to Moon, who pretended to be the old Brahman\'s son. Then Root went\nhome with the bride and bridegroom.\n\nBut then Master-mind came, and in the presence of Root, a great dispute arose\nbetween him and Moon.\n\nMaster-mind said: "Moonlight should be given to me. I married the girl first\nwith my teacher\'s permission."\n\nMoon said: "Fool! What rights have you in my wife? Her father gave her to me\nin regular marriage."\n\nSo they disputed about the princess whom one had won by fraud and the other by\nforce. But they could reach no decision.\n\n\n\nO King, tell me. Whose wife is she? Resolve my doubts, and remember the\nagreement about your head.\n\nThen the king said: "I think she is the rightful wife of Moon. For she was\nmarried to him in the regular way by her father in the presence of her\nrelatives. Master-mind married her secretly, like a thief. And when a thief\ntakes things from other people, it is never right."\n\nWhen the goblin heard this, he went back home as before. And the king stuck to\nhis purpose. He went back again, put the goblin on his shoulder, and started\nfrom the sissoo tree.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fifteenth Goblin: The Fairy Prince Cloud-chariot and the Serpent Shell-\ncrest.
