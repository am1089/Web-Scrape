Wilkins, [1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. vii\n\n### PREFACE.\n\nOn reaching India, one of my first inquiries was for a full and trustworthy\naccount of the mythology of the Hindus; but though I read various works in\nwhich some information of the kind was to be found, I sought in vain for a\ncomplete and systematic work on this subject. Since then two classical\ndictionaries of India have been published, one in Madras and one in London;\nbut though useful books of reference, they do not meet the want that this book\nis intended to supply. For some years I have been collecting materials with\nthe intention of arranging them in such a way that any one without much labour\nmight gain a good general idea of the names, character, and relationship of\nthe principal deities of Hinduism. This work does not profess to supply new\ntranslations of the Hindu Scriptures, nor to give very much information that\nis not already scattered through many other books. In a few cases original\nextracts have been made; but, generally speaking, my work has been to collect\nand arrange translations ready to hand. It has been my endeavour to give a\nfair and impartial account of these deities, as far as possible in the words\nof the sacred books; such an account as I should expect an honest-minded Hindu\nto give of God from a careful study of the Bible. I have honestly\n\np. viii\n\nstriven to keep free from prejudice and theological bias; and, wishing to let\nthe sacred books speak for themselves, have refrained from commenting on the\npassages quoted, excepting where some explanation seemed necessary. I have not\nselected those texts which describe the darker side only of the Hindu gods,\nnor have such been altogether suppressed. There was much that could not be\nreproduced. Of what was fit for publication I have taken a proportionate\namount, that this, together with what is worthy of commendation, may give a\nfaithful picture. To magnify either the good or the evil is the work of the\nadvocate--a work I, in this book, distinctly disclaim. An honest effort has\nbeen made to give a reliable account of the things commonly believed by\nmillions of our Hindu fellow-subjects.\n\nIn order to render the work more interesting and instructive, a number of\nillustrations of the principal deities have been introduced. Most of them have\nbeen copied from pictures drawn by the Hindus themselves, and which may be\nseen in the houses of the people. No attempt has been made to idealize them;\nthey are, what they profess to be, _faithful representations of the designs of\nHindu artists_. For their kindness in making these drawings from the original\nhighly-coloured pictures, I am very greatly indebted to my friends the Rev. A.\nJ. Bamford, B.A., and Messrs. H. T. Ottewill and C. A. Andrews, B.A.\n\nBy the introduction of a full index it is hoped that this work will serve as a\nclassical dictionary of India; whilst the classification of the gods will\nenable the student to obtain a general view of Hindu mythology, and of the\nrelation in which one deity stands to others. And as many legends are given at\nsome length, the book can hardly fail to be interesting to the general reader,\n\np. ix\n\nwho may not have time or opportunity to refer to the sacred writings from\nwhich they are taken.\n\nA word of explanation respecting the classification of the deities is called\nfor. It will be noticed that some of those described as belonging to the Vedic\nAge appear under the same or other names in the Pur\xc4\x81nas; whilst others spoken\nof as belonging to the Pur\xc4\x81nic Age have their origin, traceable indeed with\ndifficulty in some cases, in the Vedas. It was a common practice with the\nwriters of the later books to claim a remote antiquity, and the authority of\nthe Vedas, for the more recent additions to the Pantheon. In some instances an\nepithet, descriptive of one of the old deities, is attached as the name of a\nlater one. And by this means the old and the new are linked together. The\nVedic gods are those whose description is chiefly to be found in the Vedas,\nand whose worship was more general in the Vedic Age; the Pur\xc4\x81nic are those who\nare more fully described in the Pur\xc4\x81nas, and whose worship was more general in\nthe Pur\xc4\x81nic Age. Any very rigid classification it is impossible to make.\n\nW. J. W.\n\nCalcutta, _February 22_ , 1882.\n\n![](img/_00900.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Preface to Second Edition](hmvp02.htm)\n\n'
