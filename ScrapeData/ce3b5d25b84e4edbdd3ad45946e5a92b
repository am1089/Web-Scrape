Much more remains  \nThat should be said: but time constrains.  \nEre to his rest the sun descend,  \nAnd shades of night the combat end,  \nThe twice seven thousand of my band  \nWho fell beneath thy bloody hand  \nShall have their tears all wiped away  \nAnd triumph in thy fall to-day.'  \n\nHe spoke, and loosing from his hold  \nHis mighty mace ringed round with gold,  \nLike some red bolt alive with fire  \nHurled it at Rama, mad with ire.  \nThe ponderous mace which Khara threw  \nSent fiery flashes as it flew.  \nTrees, shrubs were scorched beneath the blast,  \nAs onward to its aim it passed.  \nBut Rama, watching as it sped  \nDire as His noose who rules the dead,  \nCleft it with arrows as it came  \nOn rushing with a hiss and flame.  \nIts fury spent and burnt away,  \nHarmless upon the ground it lay  \nLike a great snake in furious mood  \nBy herbs of numbing power subdued.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[262:1](ry227.htm#fr_476) Popularly supposed to cause death.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXX.: Khara's Death.](ry228.htm)\n\n"
