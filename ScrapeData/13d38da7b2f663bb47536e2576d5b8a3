The udgitha, of which a poet said, I choose the deep sounding note of the\nSaman as good for cattle, belongs to Agni; the indefinite note belongs to Pra\n_g_ apati, the definite note to Soma, the soft and smooth note to Vayu, the\nsmooth and strong note to Indra, the heron-like note to B _ri_ haspati, the\ndull note to Varu _n_ a. Let a man cultivate all of these, avoiding, however,\nthat of Varu _n_ a.\n\n2\\. Let a man sing 3, wishing to obtain by his song immortality for the Devas.\n'May I obtain by my song oblations (svadha) for the fathers, hope for men,\nfodder and water for animals, heaven for the sacrificer, food for myself,'\nthus reflecting on these in his mind, let a man (Udgat _ri_ priest) sing\npraises, without making mistakes in pronunciation, &c.\n\np. 34\n\n3\\. All vowels (svara) belong to Indra, all sibilants (ushman) to Pra _g_\napati, all consonants (spar _s_ a) to M _ri_ tyu (death). If somebody should\nreprove him for his vowels, let him say, 'I went to Indra as my refuge (when\npronouncing my vowels): he will answer thee.'\n\n4\\. And if somebody should reprove him for his sibilants, let him say, 'I went\nto Pra _g_ apati as my refuge: he will smash thee.' And if somebody should\nreprove him for his consonants, let him say, 'I went to M _ri_ tyu as my\nrefuge: he will reduce thee to ashes.'\n\n5\\. All vowels are to be pronounced with voice (ghosha) and strength (bala),\nso that the Udgat _ri_ may give strength to Indra. All sibilants are to be\npronounced, neither as if swallowed (agrasta) 1, nor as if thrown out\n(nirasta) 2, but well opened 3 (viv _ri_ ta), so that the Udgat _ri_ may give\nhimself to Pra _g_ apati. All consonants are to be pronounced slowly, and\nwithout crowding them together 4, so that the Udgat _ri_ may withdraw himself\nfrom M _ri_ tyu.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[33:2](sbe01056.htm#fr_151) These are lucubrations on the different tones\nemployed in singing the Saman hymns, and their names, such as vinardi,\nanirukta, nirukta, m _ri_ du _s_ laksh _n_ a, _s_ laksh _n_ a balavad, krau\xc3\xb1\n_k_ a, apadhvanta.\n\n[33:3](sbe01056.htm#fr_152) It would be better if the first ity agayet could\nbe left out. The commentator ignores these words.\n\n[34:1](sbe01056.htm#fr_153) Grasa, according to the Rig-veda-prati _s_ akhya\n766, is the stiffening of the root of the tongue in pronunciation.\n\n[34:2](sbe01056.htm#fr_154) Nirasa, according to the Rig-veda-prati _s_ akhya\n760, is the withdrawing of the active from the passive organ in pronunciation.\n\n[34:3](sbe01056.htm#fr_155) The opening, viv _ri_ ta, may mean two things,\neither the opening of the vocal chords (kha), which imparts to the ushmans\ntheir surd character (Rig. Prat. 709), or the opening of the organs of\npronunciation (kara _n_ a), which for the ushmans is asp _ri_ sh _t_ am\nsthitam (Rig. Prat. 719), or viv _ri_ ta (Ath. Prat. I, 31; Taitt. Prat. 5).\n\n[34:4](sbe01056.htm#fr_156) Anabhinihita, for thus the commentaries give the\nreading, is explained by anabhinikshipta. On the real abhinidhana, see Rig.\nPrat. 393. The translation does not follow the commentary. The genitive pra\n_g_ apate _h_ is governed by paridadani.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 23](sbe01057.htm)\n\n"
