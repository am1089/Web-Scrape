XIV.\n\nDialogue continued. Bharata expounds the nature of existence, the end of life,\nand the identification of individual with universal spirit.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Having heard these remarks, full of profound truth, the king was\nhighly pleased with the Brahman, and respectfully thus addressed him: "What\nyou have said is no doubt the truth; but in listening to it my mind is much\ndisturbed. You have shewn _that_ to be discriminative wisdom which exists in\nall creatures, and which is the great principle that is distinct from plastic\nnature; but the assertions--\'I do not bear the palankin---the palankin does\nnot rest upon me--the body, by which the vehicle is conveyed, is different\nfrom me--the conditions of elementary beings are influenced by acts, through\nthe influence of the qualities, and the qualities are the principles of\naction;\'--what sort of positions are these. Upon these doctrines entering into\nmy ears, my mind, which is anxious to investigate the truth, is lost in\nperplexity. It was my purpose, illustrious sage, to have gone to Kapila Rishi,\nto inquire of him what in this life was the most desirable object: but now\nthat I have heard from you such words, my mind turns to you, to become\nacquainted with the great end of life. The Rishi Kapila is a portion of the\nmighty and universal Vishn\xcc\x81u, who has come down upon earth to dissipate\ndelusion; and surely it is he who, in kindness to me, has thus manifested\nhimself to me in all that you have said. To me, thus suppliant, then, explain\nwhat is the best of all things; for thou art an ocean overflowing with the\nwaters of divine wisdom." The Brahman replied to the king, "You, again, ask me\nwhat is the best of all things, not what is the great end of life 1; but there\nare many things which are\n\np. 252\n\nconsidered best, as well as those which are the great ends (or truths) of\nlife. To him who, by the worship of the gods, seeks for wealth, prosperity,\nchildren, or dominion, each of these is respectively best. Best is the rite or\nsacrifice, that is rewarded with heavenly pleasures. Best is that which yields\nthe best recompense, although it be not solicited. Self-contemplation, ever\npractised by devout ascetics, is to them the best. But best of all is the\nidentification of soul with the supreme spirit. Hundreds and thousands of\nconditions may be called the best; but these are not the great and true ends\nof life. Hear what those are. Wealth cannot be the true end of life, for it\nmay be relinquished through virtue, and its characteristic property is\nexpenditure for the gratification of desire. If a son were final truth, that\nwould be equally applicable to a different source; for the son that is to one\nthe great end of life, becomes the father of another. Final or supreme truth,\ntherefore, would not exist in this world, as in all these cases those objects\nwhich are so denominated are the effects of causes, and consequently are not\nfinite. If the acquisition of sovereignty were designated by the character of\nbeing the great end of all, then finite ends would sometimes be, and sometimes\ncease to be. If you suppose that the objects to be effected by sacrificial\nrites, performed according to the rules of the Rik, Yajur, and Sama Vedas, be\nthe great end of life, attend to what I have to say. Any effect which is\nproduced through the causality of earth partakes of the character of its\norigin, and consists itself of clay; so any act performed by perishable\nagents, such as fuel, clarified butter, and Ku\xc5\x9ba grass, must itself be of but\ntemporary efficacy. The great end of life (or truth) is considered by the wise\nto be eternal; but it would be transient, if it were accomplished through\ntransitory things. If you imagine that this great truth is the performance of\nreligious acts, from which no recompense is sought, it is not so; for such\nacts are the means of obtaining liberation, and truth is (the end), not the\nmeans. Meditation on self, again, is said to be for the sake of supreme truth;\nbut the object of this is to establish distinctions (between soul and body),\nand the great truth of all is without distinctions. Union of self with supreme\nspirit is said to be the great end of all; but this is false; for one\nsubstance cannot become substantially\n\np. 253\n\nanother 2. Objects, then, which are considered most desirable are infinite.\nWhat the great end of all is, you shall, monarch, briefly learn from me. It is\nsoul: one (in all bodies), pervading, uniform, perfect, preeminent over nature\n(Prakriti), exempt from birth, growth, and decay, omnipresent, undecaying,\nmade up of true knowledge, independent, and unconnected with unrealities, with\nname, species, and the rest, in time present, past, or to come. The knowledge\nthat this spirit, which is essentially one, is in one\'s own and in all other\nbodies, is the great end, or true wisdom, of one who knows the unity and the\ntrue principles of things. As one diffusive air, passing through the\nperforations of a flute, is distinguished as the notes of the scale (Sherga\nand the rest), so the nature of the great spirit is single, though its forms\nbe manifold, arising from the consequences of acts. When the difference of the\ninvesting form, as that of god or the rest, is destroyed, then there is no\ndistinction."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[251:1](vp072.htm#fr_740) You ask what is \xc5\x9areyas, not what is Paramartha: the\nfirst means literally \'best,\' \'most excellent,\' and is here used to denote\ntemporary and special objects, or sources of happiness, as wealth, posterity,\npower, &c.; the latter is the one great object or end of life, true wisdom or\ntruth, knowledge of the real and universal nature of soul.\n\n[253:2](vp072.htm#fr_741) But this is to be understood as applying to the\ndoctrines which distinguish between the vital spirit (Jivatma) and the supreme\nspirit (Paramatma), the doctrine of the Yoga. It is here argued, that it is\nabsurd to talk of effecting a union between the soul of man and supreme soul;\nfor if they are distinct essentially, they cannot combine; if they are already\none and the same, it is nonsense to talk of accomplishing their union. The\ngreat end of life or truth is not to effect the union of two things, or two\nparts of one thing, but to know that all is unity.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XV](vp073.htm)\n\n'
