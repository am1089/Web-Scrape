But there is no parallelism (of the two things compared), since (in the\ncase of Brahman) there is not apprehended (any separate substance) comparable\nto the water.\n\nSince no substance comparable to the water is apprehended in the case of\nBrahman, a parallelism between Brahman and the reflected images of the sun\ncannot be established. In the case of the sun and other material luminous\nbodies, there exists a separate material substance occupying a different\nplace, viz. water; hence the light of the sun, &c., may be reflected. The\nSelf, on the other hand, is not a material thing, and, as it is present\neverywhere and all is identical with it, there are no limiting adjuncts\ndifferent from it and occupying a different place.--Therefore the instances\nare not parallel.\n\nThe next Sutra disposes of this objection.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 20](sbe38123.htm)\n\n'
