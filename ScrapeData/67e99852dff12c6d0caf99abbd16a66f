[1894], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 332\n\n7:2:3\n\n### THIRD BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n7:2:3:11\\. He then places a bunch of darbha (ku _s_ a) grass (poa\ncynosuroides) on (the middle of the altar-site); for the gods then placed\nplants thereon, and in like manner does the Sacrificer now place plants\nthereon.\n\n7:2:3:22\\. And, again, why he places a bunch of grass thereon;--when he (Agni)\nis built up, he is born, and he is born here for all (kinds of) food; but\nthese darbha plants (contain) both kinds of food, for they are both water and\nplants. Now the waters which, loathing V _ri_ tra, rose up on the dry land\nforming bushes, became those grasses 1,--inasmuch as they rose forming bushes\n(d _ri_ bh), they are (called) darbha-grasses. These darbha-grasses, then, are\nthe water (which remained) pure, and meet for sacrifice, when V _ri_ tra\nflowed towards it; and inasmuch as they are darbha-grasses, they are plants:\nby both kinds of food he thus gratifies him (Agni).\n\n7:2:3:33\\. [He places it] at the meeting of the furrows, for the meeting of\nfurrows is speech (the mouth) 2, and the furrows (channels) are the vital\nairs; and this is their place of meeting; and in the mouth food is put for the\nvital airs. In the middle (he places the bunch), whereby he puts it into the\nvery\n\np. 333\n\nmiddle of him; silently (he does so), for what is silent is undefined, and the\nundefined is everything: with everything he thus puts food into him.\n\n7:2:3:44\\. He then offers thereon,--when he (Agni) is built, he is born, and\nhe is born here for all (kinds of) food; but that ghee is the life-sap\n(essence) of this universe, for it is the life-sap of both the waters and\nplants: he thus gratifies him by the life-sap of this universe. And as far as\nthe life-sap extends, so far extends the body: he thus gratifies him by this\nuniverse. With (ghee) taken in five (ladlings, he offers),--the fire-altar\nconsists of five layers, five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as\ngreat as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus\ngratifies him.\n\n7:2:3:55\\. And, again, why he offers thereon;--when in the beginning the _Ri_\nshis, the vital airs 1, put together this Agni, they gained for themselves\nthat fore-share 2 in him: hence they are the fore-sharers. Thus when he offers\non (the grass-bush) he thereby gratifies those Rishis, the vital airs, who\ngained for themselves the fore-share in him (Agni). With fivefold-taken ghee\n(he offers): the significance of this has been explained.\n\n7:2:3:66\\. And, again, why he offers thereon;--whatever forms, whatever modes\nof chanting, whatever p _ri_ sh _th_ a (stotras), whatever metres he is now\ngoing to bestow on Agni, for them he prepares this fore-share, and it is them\nhe thereby gratifies. With\n\np. 334\n\nfivefold-taken ghee (he offers): the significance of this has been explained.\n\n7:2:3:77\\. And, again, why he offers thereon;--at that time the gods were\nafraid, thinking, 'Long indeed is this performance: we hope the Rakshas, the\nfiends, will not smite here this (Agni) of ours!' They saw this preliminary\nconclusion 1 of this performance, and brought that whole (Agni) to completion\neven at that (point), and built him up then; and in like manner this\n(Sacrificer) brings that whole (Agni) to completion even at this (point), and\nbuilds him now.\n\n7:2:3:88\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 74] 'The year,' this is a layer (of\nbricks);--'together with the dark half-months,' this is a layer of\nearth;--'the Dawn,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with the ruddy\n(cows),' this is a layer of earth;--'the two A _s_ vins,' this is a layer (of\nbricks); 'together with their wonderful deeds,' this is a layer of\nearth;--'the Sun,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with the dappled\nhorse,' this is a layer of earth;--'(Agni) Vai _s_ vanara,' this is a layer\n(of bricks);--'together with I _d_ a,' this is a layer of earth;--'with ghee,'\nthis is a layer (of bricks);--'Sva-,' this is a layer of earth;--'ha!' this is\na layer (of bricks).\n\n7:2:3:99\\. There are thirteen utterings,--thirteen months are a year; thirteen\nin number are the layers of bricks and earth of the fire-altar: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. With\nbutter he sacrifices,--butter is the\n\np. 335\n\nsame as Agni: it is Agni he thus builds up. With fivefold-taken (butter he\noffers),--the altar consists of five layers,--five seasons are a year, and the\nyear is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he\nthus builds him up. He offers raising (the spoon) upwards: he thus builds Agni\nupwards by means of the layers (of the altar).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[332:1](sbe4159.htm#fr_635) The author here alludes to the legend given at I,\n1, 3, 4-5,--V _ri_ tra lay enveloping all that space which extends between\nheaven and earth, and because he lay enveloping (v _ri_ ) all that, he is\ncalled V _ri_ tra. Him Indra slew. Being slain, he flowed stinking in all\ndirections towards the water; for in every direction lies the ocean. Now some\nof the water loathed him, it rose higher and higher and flowed over: hence\n(sprang) these ku _s_ a grasses,--they are indeed the water which was not\nputrified; but with the other water some (matter) has indeed become mixed when\nthe putrid V _ri_ tra flowed into it.\n\n[332:2](sbe4159.htm#fr_636) See [p. 200](sbe4134.htm#page_200), note\n[3](sbe4134.htm#fn_413).\n\n[333:1](sbe4159.htm#fr_637) See [VI, 1, 1, 1](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:1).\n\n[333:2](sbe4159.htm#fr_638) Literally, a share in front, in the first place,\ni.e. a preferential share, or fore-taste. Being accented separately,\n'purastat' here, however, forms no compound with 'bhaga;' though it does in\n'purastadbhaga,' fore-sharer. Cf. Taitt. S. V, 6, 4, 2.\n\n[334:1](sbe4159.htm#fr_639) Literally, a conclusion previously, or at the\nbeginning of the performance.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 2, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe4160.htm)\n\n"
