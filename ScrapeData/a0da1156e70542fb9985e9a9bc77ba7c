O Rudras, joined by Indra, friends on golden chariots, come hither for our\nwelfare! This prayer from us is acceptable to you like the springs of heaven\nto a thirsty soul longing for water.\n\n2\\. O you sons of P _ri_ _s_ ni, you are armed with daggers and spears, you\nare wise, carrying good bows and arrows and quivers, possessed of good horses\nand chariots. With your good weapons, O Maruts, you go to triumph!\n\n3\\. You shake [1](sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:3:1) the sky and the mountains (clouds)\nfor wealth to the liberal giver; the forests bend down out of your way from\nfear [2](sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:3:2). O sons of P _ri_ _s_ ni, you rouse the\nearth when you, O terrible ones, have harnessed the spotted deer for triumph!\n\n4\\. The Maruts, blazing with the wind, clothed in rain, are as like one\nanother as twins, and well adorned. They have tawny horses, and red horses,\nthey are faultless, endowed with exceeding vigour; they are in greatness wide\nas the heaven.\n\n5\\. Rich in rain-drops, well adorned, bounteous, terrible to behold, of\ninexhaustible wealth, noble by birth, golden-breasted, these singers of the\nsky [1](sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:5:1) have obtained their immortal name\n[2](sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:5:2).\n\n6\\. Spears are on your two shoulders, in your arms are placed strength, power,\nand might. Manly thoughts dwell in your heads, on your chariots are weapons,\nand every beauty has been laid on your bodies.\n\np. 341\n\n7\\. O Maruts, you have given us wealth of cows, horses, chariots, and heroes,\ngolden wealth! O men of Rudra, bestow on us great praise, and may I enjoy your\ndivine protection!\n\n8\\. Hark, O heroes, O Maruts! Be gracious to us! You who are of great bounty,\nimmortal, righteous, truly listening to us, poets, young, dwelling on mighty\nmountains [1](sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:8:1), and grown mighty.\n\np. 342\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same poet and deity. Metre, 1-6 Gagati; 7, 8 Trish _t_ ubh. None of its\nverses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS.; verse 6 in MS. IV, II, 4.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Dhu is construed with two accusatives, see RV. III, 45, 4; otherwise\nvasu might be connected with da _s_ ushe. The third pada is 3 literally\nrepeated soon after, V, 60, 2; see note 1 to I, 37, 7.\n\nNote 2. Ya\xc2\xb4mana _h_ bhiya\xc2\xb4 may be from fear of your approach.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. In diva _h_ arka\xc2\xb4 _h_ even Bergaigne allows that arka may mean singer,\nnot song.\n\nNote 2. Na\xc2\xb4ma, name, is here as elsewhere what is meant by the name, therefore\nimmortal being or immortality.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. B _r i_hadgiraya _h_ cannot well mean with a powerful voice. The\nMaruts are called girish _th_ a, VIII, 94, 12, dwelling on mountains, and like\nb _ri_ haddiva, b _ri_ hadgiri seems to have been intended for dwelling on\nhigh mountains.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 58.
