If one should smite upon its midst, it would sweat sap, and\nlive. If one should smite upon its top, it would sweat sap, and live. Instinct\nwith the Live Self, it stands full lush and glad.\n\nBut if the Live One leave one bough, it withers. If it leave another bough, it\nwithers. If it leave a third bough, it withers. If it leave the whole, the\nwhole withers. So know, beloved," said he,\n\np. 67\n\n"the thing whence the Live One has departed does indeed die; but the Live One\ndies not. In this subtleness has this All its essence; it is the True; it is\nthe Self; thou art it, \xc5\x9avetaketu."\n\n"Let my lord teach me further."\n\n"Be it so, beloved," said he.\n\n"Bring from yonder a fig."\n\n"Here it is, my lord."\n\n"Break it."\n\n"It is broken, my lord."\n\n"What seest thou in it? "\n\n"Here are but little seeds, my lord."\n\n"Now break one of them."\n\n"It is broken, my lord."\n\n"What seest thou in it?"\n\n"Naught whatsoever, my lord."\n\nAnd he said to him: "Of that subtleness which thou canst not behold, beloved,\nis this great fig-tree made. Have faith, beloved. In this subtleness has this\nAll its essence; it is the True; it is the Self; thou art it, \xc5\x9avetaketu."\n\n"Let my lord teach me further."\n\n"Be it so, beloved," said he.\n\n"Lay this salt in water, and on the morrow draw nigh to me." And he did so.\nThen he said to him: "Bring me the salt which thou laidst in the water yester\neve."\n\np. 68\n\nHe felt, but found it not; it was as melted away.\n\n"Drink from this end thereof. How is it?"\n\n"It is salty."\n\n"Drink from the midst. How is it?"\n\n"It is salty."\n\n"Drink from yonder end. How is it?"\n\n"It is salty."\n\n"Lay it aside, and draw nigh to me." And he did so.\n\n"It is still present," said he to him; "herein forsooth thou canst not behold\nBeing, beloved, but herein soothly it is. In this subtleness has this All its\nessence; it is the True; it is the Self; thou art it, \xc5\x9avetaketu."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[66:1](brk33.htm#fr_22) \xe1\xb9\x9aig-veda, IV. xxvi. 1.\n\n[66:2](brk33.htm#fr_23) Namely to the gods.\n\n[66:3](brk34.htm#fr_24) Chh\xc4\x81ndogya Upanishad, VI., xi.-xiii.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII: The Soul in Sleep](brk35.htm)\n\n'
