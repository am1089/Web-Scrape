On such high verities  \nReliant, rising into fellowship  \nWith Me, they are not born again at birth  \nOf Kalpas, nor at Pralyas suffer change!\n\nThis Universe the womb is where I plant  \nSeed of all lives! Thence, Prince of India, comes  \nBirth to all beings! Whoso, Kunti\'s Son!  \nMothers each mortal form, Brahma conceives,  \nAnd I am He that fathers, sending seed!\n\nSattwan, Raias, and Tamas, so are named  \nThe qualities of Nature, "Soothfastness,"  \n"Passion," and "Ignorance." These three bind down  \nThe changeless Spirit in the changeful flesh.  \nWhereof sweet "Soothfastness," by purity  \nLiving unsullied and enlightened, binds  \nThe sinless Soul to happiness and truth;  \nAnd Passion, being kin to appetite,  \nAnd breeding impulse and propensity,  \nBinds the embodied Soul, O Kunti\'s Son!  \nBy tie of works. But Ignorance, begot  \nOf Darkness, blinding mortal men, binds down  \nTheir souls to stupor, sloth, and drowsiness.  \nYea, Prince of India! Soothfastness binds souls  \nIn pleasant wise to flesh; and Passion binds  \nBy toilsome strain; but Ignorance, which blots  \nThe beams of wisdom, binds the soul to sloth.  \nPassion and Ignorance, once overcome,  \nLeave Soothfastness, O Bharata! Where this  \nWith Ignorance are absent, Passion rules;  \nAnd Ignorance in hearts not good nor quick.  \nWhen at all gateways of the Body shines  \nThe Lamp of Knowledge, then may one see well  \nSoothfastness settled in that city reigns;  \nWhere longing is, and ardour, and unrest,  \nImpulse to strive and gain, and avarice,  \nThose spring from Passion- Prince!- engrained; and where  \nDarkness and dulness, sloth and stupor are,  \n\'Tis Ignorance hath caused them, Kuru Chief!\n\nMoreover, when a soul departeth, fixed  \nIn Soothfastness, it goeth to the place-  \nPerfect and pure- of those that know all Truth.  \nIf it departeth in set habitude  \nOf Impulse, it shall pass into the world  \nOf spirits tied to works; and, if it dies  \nIn hardened Ignorance, that blinded soul  \nIs born anew in some unlighted womb.\n\nThe fruit of Soothfastness is true and sweet;  \nThe fruit of lusts is pain and toil; the fruit  \nOf Ignorance is deeper darkness. Yea!  \nFor Light brings light, and Passion ache to have;  \nAnd gloom, bewilderments, and ignorance  \nGrow forth from Ignorance. Those of the first  \nRise ever higher; those of the second mode  \nTake a mid place; the darkened souls sink back  \nTo lower deeps, loaded with witlessness!\n\nWhen, watching life, the living man perceives  \nThe only actors are the Qualities,  \nAnd knows what rules beyond the Qualities,  \nThen is he come nigh unto Me!  \nThe Soul,  \nThus passing forth from the Three Qualities-  \nWhereby arise all bodies- overcomes  \nBirth, Death, Sorrow, and Age; and drinketh deep  \nThe undying wine of Amrit.  \nArjuna. Oh, my Lord!  \nWhich be the signs to know him that hath gone  \nPast the Three Modes? How liveth he? What way  \nLeadeth him safe beyond the threefold Modes?  \nKrishna. He who with equanimity surveys  \nLustre of goodness, strife of passion, sloth  \nOf ignorance, not angry if they are,  \nNot wishful when they are not: he who sits  \nA sojourner and stranger in their midst  \nUnruffled, standing off, saying- serene-  \nWhen troubles break, "These be the Qualities!  \nHe unto whom- self-centred- grief and joy  \nSound as one word; to whose deep-seeing eyes  \nThe clod, the marble, and the gold are one;  \nWhose equal heart holds the same gentleness  \nFor lovely and unlovely things, firm-set,  \nWell-pleased in praise and dispraise; satisfied  \nWith honour or dishonour; unto friends  \nAnd unto foes alike in tolerance;  \nDetached from undertakings,- he is named  \nSurmounter of the Qualities!\n\nAnd such-  \nWith single, fervent faith adoring Me,  \nPassing beyond the Qualities, conforms  \nTo Brahma, and attains Me!\n\nFor I am  \nThat whereof Brahma is the likeness! Mine  \nThe Amrit is; and Immortality  \nIs mine; and mine perfect Felicity!\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER XIV OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Gunatrayavibhagayog,"  \nOr "The Book of Religion by Separation from  \nthe Qualities."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 15: Of Religion by Attaining the Supreme](bg15.htm)\n\n'
