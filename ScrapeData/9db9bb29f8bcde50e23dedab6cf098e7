How, O Agni, have the resplendent ones worshipped thee, aspiring through\nthe powers of the \xc3\x82yu [1](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:1:1), when\n[2](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:1:2) the gods, obtaining kith and kin of both races\n[3](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:1:3) (human and divine?), rejoiced in the song of\n_Ri_ ta (or Right) [4](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:1:4)?\n\n2\\. Give heed to this my proffered hymn, O youngest one, which is most rich in\nliberal gifts [1](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:2:1), O self-dependent one! The one\nabuses thee, the other praises thee: I thy reverer revere thy body, O Agni\n[2](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:2:2)!\n\n3\\. Thy guardians, O Agni, who saw and saved the blind son of Mamata from\ndistress [1](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:3:1)--he the possessor of all wealth has\nsaved them who have done good deeds [2](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:3:2). The\nimpostors, trying to deceive, have not deceived.\n\n4\\. The niggard, O Agni, the harmful and malicious who injures us by\nfalsehood: may the heavy spell recoil on him; may he injure his own body by\nhis evil words [1](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:4:1).\n\n5\\. And, O strong one, whatever mortal knowingly injures another mortal by\nfalsehood: from such a one, O praised Agni, protect him who praises thee.\nAgni! Do not deliver us to distress.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 2 = VS. XII, 42; TS. IV, 2, 3, 4; MS. II,\n7, 10. Verse 3 = RV. IV, 4, 13; TS. I, 2, 14, 5; MS. IV, 11, 5.\n\np. 171\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The \xc3\x82yu seems to be Agni himself. Or is it admissible to interpret ayo\n_h_ as standing _metri caus a_ for ayava _h_? Then the hemistich would refer\nto the mythical sacerdotal tribe of the \xc3\x82yus, the ancient worshippers of Agni.\nComp., for instance, X, 7, 5; 46, 8. The translation would be, 'How, O Agni,\nhave the resplendent \xc3\x82yus worshipped thee, aspiring with their powers?'\n\nNote 2. 'Because.' M. M.\n\nNote 3. Comp. VIII, 103, 7. ubhe toke tanaye dasma vi _s_ pate parshi ra\xc2\xb4dha\n_h_ maghonam.\n\nNote 4. As to _ri_ tasya sa\xc2\xb4man, comp. Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XXII, 2, and _ri_\ntasya _s_ loka _h_ , Rig-veda IV, 23, 8. Our Pada recurs IV, 7, 7 with the\nreading _ri_ tasya dha\xc2\xb4man.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. With va _k_ asa _h_ ma _m_ hish _th_ asya compare ma _m_ hish _th_\nabhi _h_ matibhi _h_ , VIII, 23, 23.\n\nNote 2. Cf. Aufrecht, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, III, 200.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Dirghatamas the son of Mamata is the reputed author of this section of\nthe first Ma _n_ _d_ ala which belongs indeed to a family of priests claiming\ndescent from him. The story of the blindness of Dirghatamas and of the\ndistress into which he fell is told in the Mahabharata I, 4179 seq., ed.\nCalc.; comp. also Geldner, Vedische Studien, II, 145.\n\nNote 2. Considering the construction of the whole verse from the grammatical\npoint of view only, one will scarcely be tempted to translate otherwise than\nwe have done. But it is rather strange that Agni is represented here as saving\nthose very guardians by the aid of whom he has saved Mamateya. The meaning\nwhich one should expect to find expressed, is rather that Agni, as he has\nsaved Mamateya by his guardians, has saved also, and will save, all pious\nworshippers. This meaning may be established\n\np. 172\n\nif we consider the construction of the verse as similar, for instance, to that\nof I, 37, 12 (vol. xxxii, p. 64): maruta _h_ yat ha va _h_ balam _g_ anan a\n_k_ u _k_ yavitana, 'O Maruts, with such strength as yours, you have caused\nmen to tremble.' Thus we may, I believe, translate here, 'Agni! With such\nguardians as thine who have seen and saved the blind son of Mamata from\ndistress, he, the possessor of all wealth (i. e. Agni), has saved all those\nwho have done good deeds.' Bergaigne (III, 191) understands the verse in the\nsame way.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The Vedic idea of the evil deeds recoiling on the evil-doer himself\nhas been treated of by Bergaigne, III, 190 seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 148](sbe46046.htm)\n\n"
