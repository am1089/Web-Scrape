This may seem very strange, nay, almost incredible\nto us. But we have only to remember what the religion of large numbers of\npeople consists in who call themselves Christians, without even having had an\nidea of what Christ really taught or what He was meant for in the history of\nmankind. There are many who know absolutely nothing either of the history or\nof the doctrines of Christianity, or if they do, they have simply learnt their\ncatechism by heart. They repeat what they have learnt, but without an atom of\nreal faith or love. Yet every human heart has its religious yearnings, it has\na hunger for religion which sooner or later wants to be satisfied. Now the\nreligion taught by the disciples of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a comes to these hungry\nsouls without any outward authority. So far from being forced on\n\np. 11\n\nthem, it is to them at first a heathen and despised religion. If they listen\nto it at all, it is of their own free will; and if they believe in any part of\nit, it is of their own free choice. A chosen religion is always stronger than\nan inherited religion, and hence we find that converts from one religion to\nanother are generally so zealous for their new faith, while those who never\nknew what real religion meant are enthusiastic in proclaiming any truths which\nthey seem to have discovered for themselves and to which their heart has\nyielded a free assent. Hence, though there may be some exaggeration in the\nnumber of those who are stated to have become converted to the religion of\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a, and though some who now call themselves converts to the\nVedanta may in reality have made but the first step towards real Christianity,\nthere can be no doubt that a religion which can achieve such successes in our\ntime, while it calls itself with perfect truth the oldest religion and\nphilosophy of the world, viz. the Vedanta, the end or highest object of the\nVeda, deserves our careful attention 1.\n\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a himself never claimed to be the founder of a new religion.\nHe simply preached the old religion of India, which was founded on the Veda,\nmore particularly on the Upanishads, and was systematised later on in the\nSutras of Badaraya _n_ a, and finally developed in the commentaries\n\np. 12\n\nof Sa _m_ kara and others. Even in preaching that religion, and in living the\nlife of a recluse, as he did, Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a by no means claimed to stand\nalone. There were several leading Vedanta preachers in India during the last\nfifty years, sometimes called Paramaha _m_ sas. Keshub Chunder Sen, well known\nin England and America, who was a great reformer with a strong leaning towards\nChristianity, was not counted as one of them, because he never passed through\nthe proper discipline and did not live the life of a Sa _m_ nyasin. But he\nmentions four among his contemporaries who deserved that title: first,\nDayananda Sarasvati, for a time unfortunately connected with Madame Blavatsky;\nsecondly, Pawari Baba of Ghazipur; thirdly, the Sikh Nagaji of Doomraon; and\nlastly, our Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, commonly called the Paramaha _m_ sa of Dakshi\n_n_ esvar. 'These,' he adds, 'are the four ascetic saints whom our friends\nhave from time to time duly honoured, and in whose company they have sought\nthe sanctifying influences of character and example. May we respect,' he\ncontinues, 'and serve with profound respect and humility, every ascetic saint\nwhom Providence may bring to us. The impure become pure in the company of\nSadhus.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[11:1](rls07.htm#fr_4) This is the explanation given of the name of Vedanta.\nBut it is probably an after-thought. Like other compounds in anta, such as\nSiddhanta, Sutranta, &c., it was probably meant at first for no more than the\nsubject-matter of the Veda; then, as it stands at the end of Brahma _n_ as and\n\xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, it was explained as end of the Veda, and lastly as the end,\ni.e. the goal, the highest object of the Veda.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Dayananda Sarasvati](rls08.htm)\n\n"
