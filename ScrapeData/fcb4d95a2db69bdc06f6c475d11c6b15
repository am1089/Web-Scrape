XVI.\n\nRibhu returns to his disciple, and perfects him in divine knowledge. The same\nrecommended to the Raja by Bharata, who thereupon obtains final liberation.\nConsequences of hearing this legend.\n\n"AFTER the expiration of another thousand years, Ribhu again repaired to the\ncity where Nidagha dwelt, to instruct him farther in true wisdom. When he\narrived near the town, he beheld a prince entering into it, with a splendid\nretinue; and his pupil Nidagha standing afar off, avoiding the crowd; his\nthroat shrivelled with starvation, and bearing from the thicket fuel and holy\ngrass. Ribhu approached him, and saluting him reverentially (as if he was a\nstranger) demanded why he was standing in such a retired spot. Nidagha\nreplied, \'There is a great crowd of people attending the entrance of the king\ninto the town, and I am staying here to avoid it.\' \'Tell me, excellent\nBrahman,\' said Ribhu, \'for I believe that thou art wise, which is here the\nking, and which is any other man.\' The king,\' answered Nidagha, is he who is\nseated on the fierce and stately elephant, vast as a mountain peak; the others\nare his attendants.\' You have shewn me,\' observed Ribhu, \'at one moment the\nelephant and the king, without noticing any peculiar characteristic by which\nthey may be distinguished. Tell me, venerable sir, is there any difference\nbetween them? for I am desirous to know which is here the elephant, which is\nthe king.\' \'The elephant,\' answered Nidagha, \'is underneath; the king is above\nhim. Who is not aware, Brahman, of the relation between that which bears and\nthat which is borne?\' To this Ribhu rejoined, \'Still explain to me, according\nto what I know of it, this matter: what is it that is meant by the word\n_underneath_ , and what is it that is termed _above_?\' As soon as he had\nuttered this, Nidagha jumped upon Ribhu, and said, \'Here is my answer to the\nquestion you have asked: I am above, like the Raja.; you are underneath, like\nthe elephant. This example, Brahman, is intended for your information.\' Very\nwell,\' said Ribhu, you, it seems, are as it were the Raja, and I am like the\nelephant; but come now do you tell me which of us two is you; which is _I_.\'\n\np. 258\n\n"When Nidagha heard these words, he immediately fell at the feet o the\nstranger, and said, Of a surety thou art my saintly preceptor Ribhu the mind\nof no other person is so fully imbued with the doctrines of unity as that of\nmy teacher, and hence I know that thou art he.\' To this Ribhu replied, \'I am\nyour preceptor, by name Ribhu, who, pleased with: the dutiful attention he has\nreceived, has come to Nidagha to give him instruction: for this purpose have I\nbriefly intimated to you divine truth, the essence of which is the non-duality\nof all.\' Having thus spoken to Nidagha, the Brahman Ribhu went away, leaving\nhis disciple profoundly impressed, by his instructions, with belief in unity.\nHe beheld all beings thenceforth as the same with himself, and, perfect in\nholy knowledge, obtained final liberation.\n\n"In like manner do thou, oh king, who knowest what duty is, regarding equally\nfriend or foe, consider yourself as one with all that exists in the world.\nEven as the same sky is apparently diversified as white or blue, so Soul,\nwhich is in truth but one, appears to erroneous vision distinct in different\npersons. That One, which here is all things, is Achyuta (Vishn\xcc\x81u); than whom\nthere is none other. He is I; he is thou; he is all: this universe is his\nform. Abandon the error of distinction."\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA resumed.--The king, being thus instructed, opened his eyes to truth,\nand abandoned the notion of distinct existence: whilst the Brahman, who,\nthrough the recollection of his former lives, had acquired perfect knowledge,\nobtained now exemption from future birth. Whoever narrates or listens to the\nlessons inculcated in the dialogue between Bharata and the king, has his mind\nenlightened, mistakes not the nature of individuality, and in the course of\nhis migrations becomes fitted for ultimate emancipation 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[258:1](vp074.htm#fr_742) This legend is a good specimen of a sectarial graft\nupon a Pauran\xcc\x81ik stem. It is in a great measure peculiar to the Vishn\xcc\x81u P., as\nalthough it occurs also in the Bhagavata, it is narrated there in a much more\nconcise manner, and in a strain that looks like an abridgment of our text.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter I](vp075.htm)\n\n'
