 \nSugriva by the hand he led  \nAnd passed within the palace where  \nStood couches which S'atrughna's care,  \nWith robes and hangings richly dyed,  \nAnd burning lamps, had seen supplied.  \nThen Bharat spake: 'I pray thee, friend,  \nThy speedy messengers to send,  \nEach sacred requisite to bring  \nThat we may consecrate our king.'  \nSugriva raised four urns of gold,  \nThe water for the rite to hold,  \nAnd bade four swiftest Vanars flee  \nAnd fill them from each distant sea.  \nThen east and west and south and north  \nThe Vanar envoys hastened forth.  \nEach in swift flight an ocean sought  \nAnd back through air his treasure brought,  \nAnd full five hundred floods beside  \nPure water for the king supplied.  \nThen girt by many a Brahman sage,  \nVasishtha, chief for reverend age,  \nHigh in a throne with jewels graced  \nKing Rama and his Sita placed.  \nThere by Jabali, far revered,  \nVijay and Kasyap's son appeared;  \nBy Gautam's side Katvayan stood,  \nAnd Vamadeva wise and good,  \nWhose holy hands in order shed  \nThe pure sweet drops on Rama's head.  \nThen priests and maids and warriors, all  \nApproaching at Vasishtha's call,  \nWith sacred drops bedewed their king,  \nThe centre of a joyous ring,  \nThe guardians of the worlds, on high,  \nAnd all the children of the sky  \nFrom herbs wherewith their hands were filled  \nBare juices on his brow distilled.  \nHis brows were bound with glistering gold  \nWhich Manu's self had worn of old,  \nBright with the flash of many a gem.  \nHis sire's ancestral diadem.  \nSatrughna lent his willing aid  \nAnd o'er him held the regal shade:  \nThe monarchs whom his arm had saved  \nThe chouries round his forehead waved.  \nA golden chain, that flashed and glowed  \nWith gems the God of Wind bestowed:  \nMahendra gave a glorious string  \nOf fairest pearls to deck the king,  \nThe skies with acclamation rang,  \nThe gay nymphs danced, the minstrels sang.  \nOn that blest day the joyful plain  \nWas clothed anew with golden grain.  \nThe trees the witching influence knew,  \nAnd bent with fruits of loveliest hue,  \nAnd Rama's consecration lent  \nNew sweetness to each flowret's scent.  \nThe monarch, joy of Raghu's line,  \nGave largess to the Brahmans, kine  \nAnd steeds unnumbered, wealth untold  \nOf robes and pearls and gems and gold.  \nA jewelled chain, whose lustre passed  \nThe glory of the sun, he cast  \nAbout his friend Sugriva's neck;  \nAnd, Angad Bali's son to deck,  \nHe gave a pair of armlets bright  \nWith diamond and lazulite.  \nA string of pearls of matchless hue  \nWhich gleams like tender moonlight threw  \nAdorned with gems of brightest sheen,  \nHe gave to grace his darling queen.  \nThe offering from his hand received  \nA moment on her bosom heaved;  \nThen from her neck the chain she drew,  \nA glance on all the Vanars threw,  \nAnd wistful eyes on Rama bent  \nAs still she held the ornament.  \nHer wish he knew, and made reply  \nTo that mute question of her eye:  \n'Yea. love; the chain on him bestow  \nWhose wisdom truth and might we know,  \nThe firm ally, the faithful friend  \nThrough toil and peril to the end,  \n   Then on Hanuman's bosom hung  \nThe chain which Sita's hand had flung:  \nSo may a cloud, when winds are still  \nWith moon-lit silver gird a hill.  \n   To every Vanar Rama gave  \nRich treasures from the mine and wave.  \nAnd with their honours well content  \nHomeward their steps the chieftains bent.  \nTen thousand years Ayodhya, blest  \nWith Rama's rule, had peace and rest.  \nNo widow mourned her murdered mate,  \nNo house was ever desolate.  \nThe happy land no murrain knew,  \nThe flocks and herds increased and grew.  \n\np. 508  \n\nThe earth her kindly fruits supplied,  \nNo harvest failed, no children died.  \nUnknown were want, disease, and crime:  \nSo calm, so happy was the time.  1  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[508:1](ry501.htm#fr_1052) Here follows in the original an enumeration of the\nchief blessings which will attend the man or woman who reads or hears read\nthis tale of Rama. These blessings are briefly mentioned at the end of the\nfirst Canto of the first book, and it appears unnecessary to repeat them here\nin their amplified form. The Bengal recension (Gorresio's edition) gives them\nmore concisely as follows: 'This is the great first poem blessed and glorious,\nwhich gives long life to men and victory to kings, the poem which Valmiki\nmade. He who listens to this wondrous tale of Rama unwearied in action shall\nbe absolved from all his sins. By listening to the deeds of Rama he who wishes\nfor sons shall obtain, his heart's desire, and to him who longs for riches\nshall riches be given. The virgin who asks for a husband shall obtain a\nhusband suited to her mind, and shall meet again her dear kinsfolk who are far\naway. They who hear this poem which Valmiki made shall obtain all their\ndesires and all their prayers shall be fulfilled.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Appendices](ry502.htm)\n\n"
