If it be said 'not so, on account of non-distinction of deeds'; we say,\n'not so, on account of beginninglessness'; this is reasonable, and it is also\nobserved.\n\nBut before creation the individual souls do not exist; since Scripture teaches\nnon-distinction 'Being only this was in the beginning.' And as then the souls\ndo not exist, no karman can exist, and it cannot therefore be said that the\ninequality of creation depends on karman.--Of this objection\n\np. 479\n\nthe Sutra disposes by saying 'on account of beginninglessness,' i.e. although\nthe individual souls and their deeds form an eternal stream, without a\nbeginning, yet non-distinction of them 'is reasonable' (i.e. may reasonably be\nasserted) in so far as, previous to creation, the substance of the souls\nabides in a very subtle condition, destitute of names and forms, and thus\nincapable of being designated as something apart from Brahman, although in\nreality then also they constitute Brahman's body only. If it were not admitted\n(that the distinctions in the new creation are due to karman), it would\nmoreover follow that souls are requited for what they have not done, and not\nrequited for what they have done. The fact of the souls being without a\nbeginning is observed, viz., to be stated in Scripture,'The intelligent one is\nnot born and dies not' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 18); so also the fact of the flow of\ncreation going on from all eternity, 'As the creator formed sun and moon\nformerly.' Moreover, the text, 'Now all this was then undeveloped. It became\ndeveloped by form and name' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 7), states merely that the\nnames and forms of the souls were developed, and this shows that the souls\nthemselves existed from the beginning. Sm _ri_ ti also says, 'Dost thou know\nboth Prak _ri_ ti and the soul to be without beginning?' (Bha. Gi. XIII,\n19.)--As Brahman thus differs in nature from everything else, possesses all\npowers, has no other motive than sport, and arranges the diversity of the\ncreation in accordance with the different karman of the individual souls,\nBrahman alone can be the universal cause.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 36.
