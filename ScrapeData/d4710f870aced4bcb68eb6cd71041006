If a _S_ udra approaches a female of the Brahma _n_ a caste, (the king)\nshall cause the _S_ udra to be tied up in Vira _n_ a grass and shall throw him\ninto a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brahma _n_ i to be shaved, and her\nbody to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a black donkey, he shall\ncause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared that she becomes\npure (thereby). 1\n\np. 110\n\n2\\. If a Vai _s_ ya approaches a female of the Brahma _n_ a caste, (the king)\nshall cause the Vai _s_ ya to be tied up in Lohita grass and shall throw him\ninto a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brahma _n_ i to be shaved, and her\nbody to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a yellowish donkey, he\nshall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared in the Veda\nthat she becomes pure (thereby).\n\n3\\. If a Kshatriya approaches a female of the Brahma _n_ a caste, (the king)\nshall cause the Kshatriya to be tied up in leaves of Sara grass and shall\nthrow him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brahma _n_ i to be\nshaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a white\ndonkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared\nin the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).\n\n4\\. A Vai _s_ ya who offends) with a female of the Kshatriya class (shall be\ntreated) in the same manner,\n\n5\\. And a _S_ udra (who offends) with females of the Kshatriya or Vai _s_ ya\ncastes.\n\n6\\. If (a wife) has been mentally unfaithful to her husband, she shall live on\nbarley or rice boiled in milk during three days, and sleep on the bare ground.\nAfter the three days (have expired), the (husband) shall offer eight hundred\nburnt-oblations, (reciting) the Savitri (and the Mantra called) _S_ iras,\nwhile she is immersed in water. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes\npure (thereby). 6\n\np. 111\n\n7\\. If (a wife) has held an (improper) conversation (with another man), she\nmust perform the same penance during a month. After (the expiration of) the\nmonth, (the husband) shall offer four times eight hundred burnt-oblations,\n(reciting) the Savitri (and the Mantra called) _S_ iras, while she is immersed\nin water. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).\n\n8\\. But if (a wife) has actually committed adultery, she shall wear during a\nyear a garment smeared with clarified butter, and sleep on a mat of Ku _s_ a\ngrass, or in a pit filled with cowdung. After (the expiration of) the year,\n(the husband) shall offer eight hundred burnt-oblations, (reciting) the\nSavitri (and the Mantra called) _S_ iras, while she is immersed in water. It\nis declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).\n\n9\\. But if she commits adultery with a Guru, she is forbidden (to assist her\nhusband) in (the fulfilment of) his sacred duties. 9\n\n10\\. But (these) four (wives) must be abandoned, (viz.) one who yields herself\nto (her husband\'s) pupil or to (his) Guru, and especially one who attempts 10\n\np. 112\n\nthe life of her lord, or who commits adultery with a man of a degraded caste.\n\n11\\. That woman of the Brahma _n_ a caste who drinks spirituous liquor, the\ngods will not admit (after death) to the same abode with her husband; losing\nall spiritual merit she wanders about in this world and is born again as a\nleech or a pearl-oyster. 11\n\n12\\. The wives of Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, and Vai _s_ yas who commit\nadultery with a _S_ udra may be purified by a penance in case no child is born\n(from their adulterous intercourse), not otherwise.\n\n13\\. (Those who have committed adultery) with a man of lower caste shall\nperform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance, succeeded by one, two, or three _K_\nandraya _n_ a. 13\n\n14\\. Faithful wives who are constantly pure and truthful (reside after death)\nin the same abodes with their husbands; those who are unfaithful are born as\njackals. 14\n\n15\\. Half the body of the husband falls if his wife 15\n\np. 113\n\ndrinks spirituous liquor. No purification is prescribed for the half which has\nfallen.\n\n16\\. If a Brahma _n_ a unintentionally commits adultery with the wife of a\nBrahma _n_ a, (he shall perform) a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance in case (the\nhusband) fulfils the religious duties (of his caste), and an Atik _ri_ _k_\n_kh_ ra penance in case (the husband) does not fulfil his religious duties. 16\n\n17\\. The same (penances are prescribed) for Kshatriyas and Vai _s_ yas (for\nadultery with women of their respective castes).\n\n18\\. If he kills a cow, let him perform, during six months, a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_\nra or a Taptak _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra, dressed in the raw hide of that (cow). 18\n\n19\\. The rule for these two (penances is as follows):\n\n20\\. \'During three days he eats in the day-time (only), and during the (next)\nthree days at night (only), he subsists during (another) period of three days\non food offered without asking, and (finally) he fasts during three days.\'\nThat is a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance. 20\n\n21\\. \'Let him drink hot water during three days; let him drink hot milk during\nthe (next) three days; after drinking during (another) period of three days\nhot clarified butter, he shall subsist on air during the (last) three days.\'\nThat is a Taptak _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance. 21\n\n22\\. And he shall give (to a Brahma _n_ a) a bull and a cow.\n\n23\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): \'Through killing a spotted\ndeer, a he-goat, and 23\n\np. 114\n\na bird three maladies (befal men), viz. jealousy, hunger, and old age;\n(therefore) let him (who is guilty of such an offence) perform (a penance)\nduring ninety-eight (days).\'\n\n24\\. Having slain a dog, a cat, an ichneumon, a snake, a frog, or a rat, let\nhim perform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance of twelve days\' duration, and give\nsomething (to a Brahma _n_ a). 24\n\n25\\. But having slain a quantity of boneless animals, equal to the weight of a\ncow, let him perform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance of twelve days\' duration,\nand give something (to a Brahma _n_ a). 25\n\n26\\. But (the same penance must be performed) for each single (slain animal)\nthat possesses bones. 26\n\n27\\. He who extinguishes the (sacred) fires shall perform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra\npenance of twelve days, and cause them to be kindled again (by priests engaged\nfor the occasion). 27\n\n28\\. He who falsely accuses a Guru shall bathe, dressed in his clothes, and\nask his Guru\'s pardon. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes pure by the\nGuru\'s forgiving him. 28\n\n29\\. An atheist shall perform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance of twelve days\'\nduration, and give up his infidelity. 29\n\np. 115\n\n30\\. But he who receives subsistence from infidels (shall perform) an Atik\n_ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance (and not repeat his offence).\n\n31\\. (The rule applicable to) a seller of Soma has been explained hereby. 31\n\n32\\. A hermit, on violating the rules of his order, shall perform a K _ri_ _k_\n_kh_ ra penance of twelve days\' duration, and continue (the observances\nobligatory on him) in a great forest.\n\n33\\. Ascetics, (offending in the same manner) as hermits, shall perform for a\nprotracted period (the vow of regulating the quantity of their food according\nto) the growth of the moon, and shall again be initiated, in accordance with\n(the rules of) the Institutes applicable to them. 33\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[109:1](sbe1424.htm#fr_615)-5. **XXI**. Gautama XXIII, 15. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa\n_n_ _d_ ita reads, instead of prasyet, \'he shall throw,\' pra _s_ yet, and\nexplains it by dahayet, he shall cause to be burnt.\' It must be understood\nthat these p. 110 extreme punishments are to be inflicted in particularly bad\ncases only.\n\n[110:6](sbe1424.htm#fr_616) \'Afterwards in order to purify her who is immersed\nin water, i.e. has plunged into water, he shall offer eight hundred, i.e.\n(such) p. 111 a number of burnt-oblations with the _S_ iras, i.e. (the words)\n"Om, ye waters, who are splendour, juice, and ambrosia," &c., which are joined\nto the Gayatri.\'--K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita. The _S_ iras, or \'head,\' is\nagain mentioned below, XXV, 13; see also Vish _n_ u LV, 9. This and the\nfollowing two rules refer to offences committed with males of equal caste.\n\n[111:9](sbe1424.htm#fr_617) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 70. Colebrooke IV, Dig.\nLXXVI, where a different reading, vyavayatirthagamanadharmebhya _h_ ; has been\nadopted, and the Sutra has been combined with the neat. The first clause may\nalso be translated, \'If she actually commits adultery, (and especially) if she\nconverses with a Guru.\'\n\n[111:10](sbe1424.htm#fr_618) Colebrooke loc. cit.; Manu IX, 80; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya 1, 72.\n\n[112:11](sbe1424.htm#fr_619) Colebrooke IV, Dig. CXIII, where _s_ ukari, \'a\nsow,\' is read instead of _s_ uktika, \'a pearl-oyster.\'\n\n[112:13](sbe1424.htm#fr_620) Manu XI, 178. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\nstates correctly that _k_ andraya _n_ ottaram, \'succeeded by one, two, or\nthree _K_ andraya _n_ as,\' may also mean \'following one, two, or three _K_\nandraya _n_ as,\' and that the number of _K_ andraya _n_ as to be performed\ndepends on the caste of the person with whom the adultery was committed. Thus\na Brahma _n_ i must perform one K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra and one _K_ andraya _n_ a\nfor adultery with a Kshatriya, one K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra and two _K_ andraya _n_\nas for adultery with a Vai _s_ ya, and one K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra and three _K_\nandraya _n_ as for adultery with a _S_ udra. His view that the rule refers to\nwives who commit the sin without intent or against their will, is open to\ndoubt. It is probably an alternative, to be adopted in lighter cases, for the\npublic punishment prescribed above, XXI, 1-3. Regarding the _K_ andraya _n_ a,\nsee below, XXIV, 44,\n\n[112:14](sbe1424.htm#fr_621) Colebrooke IV, Dig. CVIII; Manu V, 164-165.\n\n[112:15](sbe1424.htm#fr_622) Manu IX, 80; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 73.\n\n[113:16](sbe1424.htm#fr_623) \'Vish _n_ u LIII, 2.\n\n[113:18](sbe1424.htm#fr_624) Vish _n_ u L, 16-24; Gautama XXII, 18.\n\n[113:20](sbe1424.htm#fr_625) Vish _n_ u XLVI, 10.\n\n[113:21](sbe1424.htm#fr_626) Vish _n_ u XLVI, 11.\n\n[113:23](sbe1424.htm#fr_627) The above translation follows the commentary of K\n_ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita, p. 114 who further states that the penance to be\nperformed shall consist of a diet of barley gruel. I feel by no means certain\nthat his interpretation, especially that of the last clause, is correct.\nPossibly ash _t_ anavatim aharet may mean \'he shall offer ninety-eight\noblations.\'\n\n[114:24](sbe1424.htm#fr_628) Vish _n_ u L, 30, 31.\n\n[114:25](sbe1424.htm#fr_629) Gautama XXII, 21. \'Something\' means eight\nhandfuls of grain.\n\n[114:26](sbe1424.htm#fr_630) Gautama XXII, 22.\n\n[114:27](sbe1424.htm#fr_631) Vish _n_ u LIV, 13; Gautama XXII, 34.\n\n[114:28](sbe1424.htm#fr_632) Vish _n_ u LIV, 14; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 283.\n\n[114:29](sbe1424.htm#fr_633)-30. Vish _n_ u LIV, 15.\n\n[115:31](sbe1424.htm#fr_634) Vish _n_ u LIV, 17.\n\n[115:33](sbe1424.htm#fr_635) The penance prescribed appears to be similar to\nthe _K_ andraya _n_ a. The offender must eat one mouthful on the first lunar\nday, two on the second, and so forth. But it is not clear for how long a\nperiod the rule is to be observed. The Sutra is interesting as it furnishes\ncorroborative evidence for Pa _n_ ini\'s statement (IV, 3, 110) that Bhikshu-\nsutras which contained the, rules applicable to Bhikshus formerly existed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXII](sbe1425.htm)\n\n'
