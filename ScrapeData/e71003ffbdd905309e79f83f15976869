The question of the priority of the two Bhagavatas has been often\ndiscussed more in the spirit of partisans rather than that of sober scholars.\nWe reserve our opinion on the subject till the publication of the complete\ntranslation of this work.\n\nThis translation has been inscribed to the sacred memory of my friend the late\nRai Bahadur S\xc2\x92ris\xc2\x92 Chandra Vidyar _n_ ava who induced me to undertake the\ntranslation of this work. He had thoroughly read the two Bhagavatas and it was\nhis opinion that the priority of composition belonged to the Devi Bhagavatam.\nThe other Bhagavat, according to him, is a modern compilation attributed to\nBopadeva \xc2\x96 the author of Mugdhabodha Vyakara _n_ am.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Contents](db03.htm)\n\n'
