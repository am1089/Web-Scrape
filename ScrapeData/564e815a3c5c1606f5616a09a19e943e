If it be said (that Brahman is) not (meant), on account of characteristic\nmarks of the individual soul and the chief vital air (being mentioned); we say\nno, on account of the threefoldness of devout meditation (which would result\nfrom your interpretation); on account of (the meaning advocated by us) being\naccepted (elsewhere); and on account of (characteristic marks of Brahman)\nbeing connected (with the passage under discussion).\n\nAlthough we admit, the purvapakshin resumes, that the chapter about the pra\n_n_ a does not furnish any instruction regarding some outward deity, since it\ncontains a multitude of references to the interior Self; still we deny that it\nis concerned with Brahman.--For what reason?--Because it mentions\ncharacteristic marks of the individual soul on the one hand, and of the chief\nvital air on the other hand. The passage, 'Let no man try to find out what\nspeech is, let him know the speaker,' mentions a characteristic mark of the\nindividual soul, and must therefore be held to point out as the object of\nknowledge the individual soul which rules and employs the different organs of\naction such as speech and so on. On the other hand, we have the passage, 'But\npra _n_ a alone, the intelligent Self, having laid hold of this body makes it\nrise up,' which points to the chief vital air; for the chief attribute of the\nvital air is that it sustains the body. Similarly, we read in the colloquy of\nthe vital airs (Pra. Up. II, 3), concerning speech and the other vital airs,\n'Then pra _n_ a (the chief vital air) as the best said to them: Be not\ndeceived; I alone dividing myself fivefold support this body and keep it.'\nThose, again, who in the\n\np. 103\n\npassage quoted above read 'this one (masc.), the body 1' must give the\nfollowing explanation, Pra _n_ a having laid hold of this one, viz. either the\nindividual soul or the aggregate of the sense organs, makes the body rise up.\nThe individual soul as well as the chief vital air may justly be designated as\nthe intelligent Self; for the former is of the nature of intelligence, and the\nlatter (although non-intelligent in itself) is the abode of other pra _n_ as,\nviz. the sense organs, which are the instruments of intelligence. Moreover, if\nthe word pra _n_ a be taken to denote the individual soul as well as the chief\nvital air, the pra _n_ a and the intelligent Self may be spoken of in two\nways, either as being non-different on account of their mutual concomitance,\nor as being different on account of their (essentially different) individual\ncharacter; and in these two different ways they are actually spoken of in the\ntwo following passages, 'What is pra _n_ a that is pra _g \xc3\xb1_a, what is pra _g\n\xc3\xb1_a that is pra _n_ a;' and, 'For together do these two live in the body and\ntogether do they depart.' If, on the other hand, pra _n_ a denoted Brahman,\nwhat then could be different from what? For these reasons pra _n_ a does not\ndenote Brahman, but either the individual soul or the chief vital air or both.\n\nAll this argumentation, we reply, is wrong, 'on account of the threefoldness\nof devout meditation.' Your interpretation would involve the assumption of\ndevout meditation of three different kinds, viz. on the individual soul, on\nthe chief vital air, and on Brahman. But it is inappropriate to assume that a\nsingle sentence should enjoin three kinds of devout meditation; and that all\nthe passages about the pra _n_ a really constitute one single sentence (one\nsyntactical whole) appears from the beginning and the concluding part. In the\nbeginning we have the clause 'Know me only,' followed by 'I am pra _n_ a, the\nintelligent Self, meditate on me as Life, as Immortality;' and in the end we\nread, 'And that pra _n_ a indeed is the intelligent Self, blessed,\nimperishable, immortal.' The beginning and the concluding part are thus seen\nto be similar, and we\n\np. 104\n\ntherefore must conclude that they refer to one and the same matter. Nor can\nthe characteristic mark of Brahman be so turned as to be applied to something\nelse; for the ten objects and the ten subjects (subjective powers) 1cannot\nrest on anything but Brahman. Moreover, pra _n_ a must denote Brahman 'on\naccount of (that meaning) being accepted,' i.e. because in the case of other\npassages where characteristic marks of Brahman are mentioned the word pra _n_\na is taken in the sense of 'Brahman.' And another reason for assuming the\npassage to refer to Brahman is that here also, i.e. in the passage itself\nthere is 'connexion' with characteristic marks of Brahman, as, for instance,\nthe reference to what is most beneficial for man. The assertion that the\npassage, 'Having laid hold of this body it makes it rise up,' contains a\ncharacteristic mark of the chief vital air, is untrue; for as the function of\nthe vital air also ultimately rests on Brahman it can figuratively be ascribed\nto the latter. So Scripture also declares, 'No mortal lives by the breath that\ngoes up and by the breath that goes down. We live by another in whom these two\nrepose' (Ka. Up. II, 5, 5). Nor does the indication of the individual soul\nwhich you allege to occur in the passage, 'Let no man try to find out what\nspeech is, let him know the speaker,' preclude the view of pra _n_ a denoting\nBrahman. For, as the passages, 'I am Brahman,' 'That art thou,' and others,\nprove, there is in reality no such thing as an individual soul absolutely\ndifferent from Brahman, but Brahman, in so far as it differentiates itself\nthrough the mind (buddhi) and other limiting conditions, is called individual\nsoul, agent, enjoyer. Such passages therefore as the one alluded to, (viz.\n'let no man try to find out what speech is, let him know the speaker,') which,\nby setting aside all the differences due to limiting conditions, aim at\ndirecting the mind on the internal Self and thus showing that the\n\np. 105\n\nindividual soul is one with Brahman, are by no means out of place. That the\nSelf which is active in speaking and the like is Brahman appears from another\nscriptural passage also, viz. Ke. Up. I, 5, 'That which is not expressed by\nspeech and by which speech is expressed that alone know as Brahman, not that\nwhich people here adore.' The remark that the statement about the difference\nof pra _n_ a and pra _g \xc3\xb1_a (contained in the passage, 'Together they dwell in\nthis body, together they depart') does not agree with that interpretation\naccording to which pra _n_ a is Brahman, is without force; for the mind and\nthe vital air which are the respective abodes of the two powers of cognition\nand action, and constitute the limiting conditions of the internal Self may be\nspoken of as different. The internal Self, on the other hand, which is limited\nby those two adjuncts, is in itself non-differentiated, so that the two may be\nidentified, as is done in the passage 'pra _n_ a is pra _g \xc3\xb1_a.'\n\nThe second part of the Sutra is explained in a different manner also 1, as\nfollows: Characteristic marks of the individual soul as well as of the chief\nvital air are not out of place even in a chapter whose topic is Brahman. How\nso? 'On account of the threefoldness of devout meditation.' The chapter aims\nat enjoining three kinds of devout meditation on Brahman, according as Brahman\nis viewed under the aspect of pra _n_ a, under the aspect of pra _g \xc3\xb1_a, and\nin itself. The passages, 'Meditate (on me) as life, as immortality. Life is\npra _n_ a,' and 'Having laid hold of this body it makes it rise up. Therefore\nlet man worship it alone as uktha,' refer to the pra _n_ a aspect. The\nintroductory passage, 'Now we shall explain how all things become one in that\npra _g \xc3\xb1_a,' and the subsequent passages, 'Speech verily milked one portion\nthereof; the word is its object placed outside;' and, 'Having by pra _g \xc3\xb1_a\ntaken possession of speech he obtains by speech all words &c.,' refer to the\npra _g \xc3\xb1_a aspect. The Brahman aspect finally is referred to in the following\npassage, 'These ten\n\np. 106\n\nobjects have reference to pra _g \xc3\xb1_a, the ten subjects have reference to\nobjects. If there were no objects there would be no subjects; and if there\nwere no subjects there would be no objects. For on either side alone nothing\ncould be achieved. But that is not many. For as in a car the circumference of\nthe wheel is set on the spokes and the spokes on the nave, thus are these\nobjects set on the subjects and the subjects on the pra _n_ a.' Thus we see\nthat the one meditation on Brahman is here represented as threefold, according\nas Brahman is viewed either with reference to two limiting conditions or in\nitself. In other passages also we find that devout meditation on Brahman is\nmade dependent on Brahman being qualified by limiting adjuncts; so, for\ninstance ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 2), 'He who consists of mind, whose body is pra\n_n_ a.' The hypothesis of Brahman being meditated upon under three aspects\nperfectly agrees with the pra _n_ a chapter 1; as, on the one hand, from a\ncomparison of the introductory and the concluding clauses we infer that the\nsubject-matter of the whole chapter is one only, and as, on the other hand, we\nmeet with characteristic marks of pra _n_ a, pra _g \xc3\xb1_a, and Brahman in turns.\nIt therefore remains a settled conclusion that Brahman is the topic of the\nwhole chapter.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[103:1](sbe34037.htm#fr_136) Ima _m_ _s_ ariram instead of ida _m_ _s_ ariram\n\n[104:1](sbe34037.htm#fr_137) Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _s_ abdadaya _h_ pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a p _ri_\nthivyadaya _s_ _k_ a da _s_ a bhutamatra _h_ pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a buddhindriya _n_ i pa\n_\xc3\xb1 k_a buddhaya iti da _s_ a pra _g \xc3\xb1_amatra _h_.
