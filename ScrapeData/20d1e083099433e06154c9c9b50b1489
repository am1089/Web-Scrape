The slanderous word,  \nThe boastful lie, were never heard.  \nEach man was constant to his vows,  \nAnd lived devoted to his spouse.  \nNo other love his fancy knew,  \nAnd she was tender, kind, and true.  \nHer dames were fair of form and face,  \nWith charm of wit and gentle grace,  \nWith modest raiment simply neat,  \nAnd winning manners soft and sweet.  \nThe twice-born sages, whose delight  \nWas Scripture's page and holy rite,  \nTheir calm and settled course pursued,  \nNor sought the menial multitude.  \nIn many a Scripture each was versed,  \nAnd each the flame of worship nursed,  \n   And gave with lavish hand.  \nEach paid to Heaven the offerings due,  \nAnd none was godless or untrue  \n   In all that holy band.  \nTo Brahmans, as the laws ordain,  \nThe Warrior caste were ever fain  \n   The reverence due to pay;  \nAnd these the Vais'yas' peaceful crowd,  \nWho trade and toil for gain, were proud  \n\n   To honour and obey;  \nAnd all were by the S'udras  1 served,  \nWho never from their duty swerved,  \nTheir proper worship all addressed  \nTo Brahman, spirits, God, and guest.  \nPure and unmixt their rites remained,  \nTheir race's honour ne'er was stained.  2  \nCheered by his grandsons, sons, and wife,  \nEach passed a long and happy life.  \nThus was that famous city held  \nBy one who all his race excelled,  \n   Blest in his gentle reign,  \nAs the whole land aforetime swayed  \nBy Manu, prince of men, obeyed  \n   Her king from main to main.  \nAnd heroes kept her, strong and brave,  \nAs lions guard their mountain cave:  \nFierce as devouring flame they burned,  \nAnd fought till death, but never turned.  \nHorses had she of noblest breed,  \nLike Indra's for their form and speed,  \nFrom Vahli's  3 hills and Sindhu's  4 sand,  \nVanayu  5 and Kamboja's land.  6  \n\np. 14  \n\nHer noble elephants had strayed  \nThrough Vindhyan and Himalayan shade,  \nGigantic in their bulk and height,  \nYet gentle in their matchless might.  \nThey rivalled well the world-spread fame  \nOf the great stock from which they came,  \n   Of Vaman, vast of size,  \nOf Mahapadma's glorious line,  \nThine, Aujan, and, Airavat, thine. [1](ry009.htm#fn_75)  \n   Upholders of the skies.  \nWith those, enrolled in fourfold class,  \nWho all their mighty kin surpass,  \nWhom men Matangas name,  \nAnd Mrigas spotted black and white,  \nAnd Bhadras of unwearied might,  \nAnd Mandras hard to tame.  [2](ry009.htm#fn_76)  \nThus, worthy of the name she bore, [3](ry009.htm#fn_77)  \nAyodhya for a league or more  \n   Cast a bright glory round,  \nWhere Das'aratha wise and great  \nGoverned his fair ancestral state,  \n   With every virtue crowned.  \nLike Indra in the skies he reigned  \nIn that, good town whose wall contained  \n   High domes and turrets proud,  \nWith gates and arcs of triumph decked,  \nAnd sturdy barriers to protect  \n   Her gay and countless crowd.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[12:1b](ry007.htm#fr_67) The _Sataghn i, i. e. centicide_, or slayer of a\nhundred, is generally supposed to be a sort of fire-arms, or the ancient\nIndian rocket; but it is also described as a stone set round with iron spikes.\n\n[12:2b](ry007.htm#fr_68) The Nagas (serpents) are demigods with a human face\nand serpent body. They inhabit Patala or the regions under the earth.\nBhogavati is the name of their capital city. Serpents are still worshipped in\nIndia. See Fergusson'a _Tree and Serpent Worship._\n\n[13:1](ry008.htm#fr_69) The fourth and lowest pure caste whose duty was to\nserve the three first classes.\n\n[13:2](ry008.htm#fr_70) By forbidden marriages between persons of different\ncastes.\n\n[13:3](ry008.htm#fr_71) Vahli or Vahlika is Bactriana; its name is preserved\nin the modern Balkh.\n\n[13:4](ry008.htm#fr_72) The Sanskrit word Sindhu is in the singular the name\nof the river Indus, in the plural of the people and territories on its banks.\nThe name appears as _Hidhu_ in the cuneiform inscription of Darius son of\nHystaspes, in which the nations tributary to that king are enumerated.\n\nThe Hebrew form is _Hodda_ (Esther, 1. I.) In Zend it appears as _Hendu_ in a\nsomewhat wider sense. With the Persians later the signification of _Hind_\nseems to have co-extended with their increasing acquaintance with the country.\nThe weak Ionic dialect omitted the Persian _h_ , and we find in Hecataeus and\nHerodotus _Indos_ and _hae Indikae_. In this form the Romans received the\nnames and transmitted them to us. The Arabian geographers in their ignorance\nthat Hind and Sind are two forms of the same word have made of them two\nbrothers and traced their decent from Noah. See Lassen's Indische\nAlterthumskunde Vol. I. pp. 2, 3.\n\n[13:5](ry008.htm#fr_73) The situation of Vanayu is not exactly determined: it\nseems to have lain to the north-west of India.\n\n[13:6](ry008.htm#fr_74) Kamboja was probably still further to the north-west.\nLassen thinks that the p. 14 name is etymologically connected with _Cambyses_\nwhich in the cuneiform inscription of Behistun is written Ka(m)bujia.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto VII.: The Ministers.](ry009.htm)\n\n"
