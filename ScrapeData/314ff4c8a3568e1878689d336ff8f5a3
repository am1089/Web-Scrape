Prayer to the kushtha-plant to destroy takman (fever).\n\n1\\. Thou that art born upon the mountains, as the most potent of plants, come\nhither, O kushtha, destroyer of the takman, to drive out from here the takman!  \n2\\. To thee (that growest) upon the mountain, the brooding-place of the eagle,\n(and) art sprung from Himavant, they come with treasures, having heard (thy\nfame). For they know (thee to be) the destroyer of the takman.  \n3\\. The asvattha-tree is the seat of the gods in the third heaven from here.\nThere the gods procured the kushtha, the visible manifestation of amrita\n(ambrosia).  \n4\\. A golden ship with golden tackle moved upon the heavens. There the gods\nprocured the kushtha, the flower of amrita (ambrosia).  \n5\\. The paths were golden, and golden were the oars; golden were the ships,\nupon which they carried forth the kushtha hither (to the mountain).  \n6\\. This person here, O kushtha, restore for me, and cure him! Render him free\nfrom sickness for me!  \n7\\. Thou art born of the gods, thou art Soma's good friend. Be thou propitious\nto my in-breathing and my out-breathing, and to this eye of mine!  \n8\\. Sprung in the north from the Himavant (mountains), thou art brought to the\npeople in the east. There the most stiperior varieties of the kushtha were\napportioned.  \n9\\. 'Superior,' O kushtha, is thy name; 'superior' is the name of thy father.\nDo thou drive out all disease, and render the takman devoid of strength!  \n10\\. Pain in the head, affliction in the eye, and ailment of the body, all\nthat shall the kushtha heal-a divinely powerful (remedy), forsooth!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIX, 39.
