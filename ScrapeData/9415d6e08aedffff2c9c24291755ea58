And on account of the objections to his view.\n\nThe theory of Brahman being the universal cause has to be accepted not only\nbecause it is itself free from objections, but also because the pradhana\ntheory is open to objections, and hence must be abandoned. For on this latter\ntheory the origination of the world cannot be accounted for. The Sa _n_ khyas\nhold that owing to the soul's approximation to Prak _ri_ ti the attributes of\nthe latter\n\np. 425\n\nare fictitiously superimposed upon the soul which in itself consists entirely\nof pure intelligence free from all change, and that thereon depends the\norigination of the empirical world. Now here we must raise the question as to\nthe nature of that approximation or nearness of Prak _ri_ ti which causes the\nsuperimposition on the changeless soul of the attributes of Prak _ri_ ti. Does\nthat nearness mean merely the existence of Prak _ri_ ti or some change in Prak\n_ri_ ti? or does it mean some change in the soul?--Not the latter; for the\nsoul is assumed to be incapable of change.--Nor again a change in Prak _ri_\nti; for changes in Prak _ri_ ti are supposed, in the system, to be the effects\nof superimposition, and cannot therefore be its cause. And if, finally, the\nnearness of Prak _ri_ ti means no more than its existence, it follows that\neven the released soul would be liable to that superimposition (for Prak _ri_\nti exists always).--The Sa _n_ khya is thus unable to give a rational account\nof the origination of the world. This same point will be treated of fully in\nconnexion with the special refutation of the Sa _n_ khya theory. (II, 2, 6.)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 11.
