May the mortal truly by sacrifices, O god, (magnify) the stronger one for\nhelp; may the Puru, when good service has been performed, magnify Agni (and\nthereby draw him) hither for his aid.\n\n2\\. For thou art manifestly considered as his (i. e. Agni's) disposer, highly\nbrilliant by thyself [1](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:2:1): (magnify then Agni who is)\na firmament of bright splendour, lovely beyond [2](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:2:2)\nthought [3](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:2:3).\n\n3\\. (It is) yonder (sun?) who verily has been yoked by his (i. e. Agni's)\nlight [1](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:3:1) through the impetuous speech\n[2](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:3:2)--(by the light of Agni) whose flames mightily\nshine as if (they were made to shine) by the sperm of heaven\n[3](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:3:3).\n\n4\\. Through his, the wise one's, insight there is wealth on his, the wonderful\n(Agni's), chariot. And Agni is praised, he who is to be invoked among all\npeoples.\n\n5\\. Now indeed our liberal lords have manifestly attained\n[1](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:5:1) treasure. Offspring of vigour! Protect us for\nthe sake of victory! Help us to welfare!

I have translated the text in its traditional form, which I think is\ncorrect. On the vocative vidharman, comp. Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, p.\n106. One could think, however, of reading vidharman as a locative, and svaya\n_s_ astare, and of considering manyase as a first person, like ar _k_ ase,\n&c.: 'For in his extension, brilliant by itself, I manifestly comprehend that\nfirmament,' &c.\n\nNote 2. Cf. VIII, 72, 3. anta _h_ i _k_ _kh_ anti tam _g_ ane rudram para _h_\nmanishaya. 'Ueber alle Vorstellung hinaus.' Ludwig.\n\nNote 3. If we read svaya _s_ astara _h_ , vidharman, and explain manyase as\nsecond person, the following translation of this difficult verse may be\nattempted: 'Thou art manifestly, indeed, considered as very brilliant by\nthyself in its (the firmament's) extension: that firmament of bright splendour\n(I praise), lovely beyond thought.' It is not very probable, however, that\nasya should refer to anything else but Agni.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a, whom Ludwig follows, very probably is right in\ninterpreting asau as the sun.--On the Sandhi, compare Roth, Zeitschrift der\nDeutschen Morgenland. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 679.\n\nNote 2. Through the sacred spell, by which the sun is made to rise through the\nkindling of the fire.--Cf. VIII, 17, 1, 5. tu _g_ a\xc2\xb4 \xe2\x80\xa6 g _ri_ bha\xc2\xb4.\n\nNote 3. Does this mean that Agni's flames shine like lightning which receives\nits light from the waters of the cloud, the sperm of heaven? Cf. IX, 74, 1,\nwhere it is said of the Soma mixed with water: diva _h_ retasa sa _k_ ate.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. I think that sa _k_ anta should be accented, because it is connected\nwith hi.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 18](sbe46122.htm)\n\n"
