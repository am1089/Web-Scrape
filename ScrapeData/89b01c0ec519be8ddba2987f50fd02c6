The gods then said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby doubtless they meant to\nsay, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst they were meditating, Savit _ri_ saw those\nSavitra (formulas); and inasmuch as Savit _ri_ saw them, they are called\nSavitra. He offered that eightfold-taken libation; and when he had offered it,\nhe saw this eightfold-appointed Asha _dh_ a 1, which had been created\naforetime.\n\np. 191\n\n6:3:1:22\\. Now when they said, 'Meditate ye!' they doubtless meant to say,\n'Seek ye a layer!' and inasmuch as they saw it whilst meditating ( _k_ etay),\ntherefore it is a layer ( _k_ iti). And the libation is a sacrifice; and\ninasmuch as he saw it after sacrificing (ish _t_ va), it is a brick (ish _t_\naka).\n\n6:3:1:33\\. Now that same (libation of ghee), while being a single one, he\noffers as an eightfold one 1 with eight formulas: whence this ('invincible'\nbrick), while being a single one, is eightfold appointed.\n\n6:3:1:44\\. He offers while raising upwards (the spoon);--he thereby raises\nthis earth upwards by means of its forms 2: whence this earth is raised (above\nthe water) by its forms.\n\n6:3:1:55\\. He offers it continuously;--for at that time the gods were afraid\nlest the Rakshas, the fiends, should come thither after them! They saw that\ncontinuous libation for preventing the Rakshas, the fiends, from coming after\nthem: hence he offers it continuously.\n\n6:3:1:66\\. And, again, why he offers that libation;--this Agni is Savit _ri_ ,\nand him he gratifies at the outset by this libation; and having sacrificed to,\nand gratified, him (Agni), he then puts him together. And inasmuch as by this\n(libation) he gratifies Savit _ri_ , they (the formulas are called) Savitra:\nthat is why he offers this libation.\n\np. 192\n\n6:3:1:77\\. And, again, why he offers this libation;--this Agni is Savit _ri_ ,\nand him he pours out as seed at the outset by this libation; and whatlike seed\nis poured into the womb suchlike (offspring) is born. And inasmuch as by this\n(libation) he pours out Savit _ri_ as seed, they (the offering-formulas are\ncalled) Savitra: that is why he offers this libation.\n\n6:3:1:88\\. Both an offering-spoon (sru _k_ ) and a dipping-spoon (sruva) are\nused thereat; for the offering-spoon is speech, and the dipping-spoon is\nbreath; and with speech and breath the gods sought this sacred rite at the\nbeginning: hence there are an offering-spoon and a dipping-spoon.\n\n6:3:1:99\\. And, again, why there are an offering-spoon and a dipping-spoon,--\nwhat Pra _g_ apati was, that indeed is this dipping-spoon, for the dipping-\nspoon is the breath, and the breath is Pra _g_ apati. And what Va _k_ (speech)\nwas, that is this offering-spoon; for Va _k_ is a female, and the offering-\nspoon (sru _k_ , f.) is a female; and those waters which went forth from the\nworld of Va _k_ (speech) 1, they are this (ghee) which he offers (in) this\nlibation.\n\n6:3:1:1010\\. He offers it continuously, for those waters flowed continuously.\nAnd inasmuch as that Pra _g_ apati entered the waters with the threefold\nscience 2, that is these prayers (ya _g_ us) with which this (priest) now\noffers.\n\n6:3:1:1111\\. The first three which there are, are these (three) worlds; and\nwhat fourth prayer there is that\n\np. 193\n\nis the threefold science, that is the _G_ agati,--the _G_ agati being all the\nmetres, and all the metres (making up) the threefold science; and what last\nfour (prayers) there are, they are the quarters: now Pra _g_ apati indeed is\nthose worlds and the quarters; and that ( _g_ agati verse in the middle) is\nthe threefold science.\n\n6:3:1:1212\\. He offers with (Va _g_. S. XI, 1), 'Harnessing first the mind,'--\nPra _g_ apati, assuredly, is he that harnesses, he harnessed the mind for that\nholy work; and because he harnessed the mind for that holy work, therefore he\nis the harnessing one.\n\n6:3:1:1313\\. 'Savit _ri_ , stretching out the thoughts,'--for Savit _ri_ is\nthe mind, and the thoughts are the vital airs;--'gazing reverently at Agni's\nlight,'--that is, having seen Agni's light;--'bore up from the earth;' for\nupwards from the earth he indeed bears this (offering).\n\n6:3:1:1414\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 2] 'With harnessed mind we,'--he thereby\nharnesses the mind for this work, for with unharnessed mind one cannot now do\nanything;--'at the impulse of the god Savit _ri_ ,'--that is impelled (sped)\nby the god Savit _ri_ ,--'with power (we strive) for the heavenly;'--'that by\nthis holy work he may go to the heavenly world,' he thereby means to say;\n'with power,' he says, for by power (energy) one goes to the heavenly world.\n\n6:3:1:1515\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 3] 'Savit _ri_ , having harnessed the gods,'--\nSavit _ri_ is the mind, and the gods are the vital airs;--'going by thought to\nthe light, to heaven,'--for as such as are going to the heavenly world by\nthought (devotion) he has harnessed them for this holy work;--'going to\nproduce a mighty light,'--the mighty light assuredly is yonder sun, and\n\np. 194\n\nhe is this Agni, and him they are indeed going to fit together (or,\nrestore);--'may Savit _ri_ speed them!'--that is, 'may they perform this holy\nwork, sped by Savit _ri_.'\n\n6:3:1:1616\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 4] 'They harness the mind, and they harness the\nthoughts,'--for both the mind and the vital airs he harnesses for this holy\nwork;--'the priests of the priest,'--the priest is Pra _g_ apati, and the\npriests are the gods;--'of the great inspirer of devotion,'--the great\ninspirer of devotion 1 is Pra _g_ apati;--'he hath assigned the priestly\noffices,'--now when he (Agni-Pra _g_ apati) is built up, then he assigns the\npriestly offices, for the priestly offices are assigned over the built-up\n(fire-altar);--'the finder of rites,'--for he indeed found this rite;--'he\nalone,' for he alone found this whole holy rite;--'mighty is the praise of the\ngod Savit _ri_ ,'--that is, 'great is the praise of the god Savit _ri_.'\n\n6:3:1:1717\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 5 _Ri_ k S. X, 13, 1] 'By devotions I harness\nyour old inspiration,'--the old inspiration (brahman) doubtless is the vital\nair, and devotion is food, and that food is this oblation: by means of this\noblation, by means of this food, he harnesses the vital airs for this holy\nwork,--'May the praise spread abroad on the lord's path,'--this he says in\norder that there may be for the Sacrificer the praise of fame among both gods\nand men;--'may all sons of the immortal hear!'--the immortal one doubtless is\nPra _g_ apati, and his sons are all the gods;--'who have resorted\n\np. 195\n\nto the heavenly abodes;'--the heavenly abodes are these worlds: the gods that\nare in these worlds, with regard to them he says this.\n\n6:3:1:1818\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 6; _Ri_ k S. V, 81, 3] 'Whose course the others\nhave followed,'--for Pra _g_ apati first performed this rite, whereupon the\ngods performed it;--'the gods with vigour, the god's greatness,'--the\ngreatness is the sacrifice, thus: 'the gods with vigour (followed) the god's\nsacrifice, his energy;'--'that dappled steed who hath measured the terrestrial\n(regions),'--whatsoever is on this earth that is terrestrial, all that he\nmeasures out; for with his rays he reaches down to it;--'the regions, he the\ngod Savit _ri_ by his greatness,'--the regions are these worlds, and the god\nSavit _ri_ is yonder sun: he measures them by his greatness.\n\n6:3:1:1919\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 7] 'God Savit _ri_ , speed the sacrifice, speed\nthe lord of sacrifice unto his share!'--the god Savit _ri_ is yonder sun, and\nhis share is the sacrifice, that he means to say when he says 'speed the\nsacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice!'--'May the heavenly, thought-cleansing\nGandharva cleanse our thought!'--the heavenly Gandharva is yonder sun, and\nthought is (sacrificial) food; thus, 'May the food-cleanser cleanse our\nfood!'--'May the lord of speech render agreeable our speech!'--this sacred\nrite is speech, and the lord of speech is the breath: thus, 'May the breath\nrender agreeable this rite of ours!!\n\n6:3:1:2020\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 8] 'Further, O god Savit _ri_ , this our\nsacrifice!'--the god Savit _ri_ is yonder sun, and whatever sacrificial rite\nhe furthers, that\n\np. 196\n\nreaches its end safely and auspiciously;--'as one pleasant to the gods,'--that\nis, as one which shall please the gods;--'friend-gaining, ever-winning,\nwealth-winning, heaven-winning,'--that is, one that may gain all this;--'Make\nthe hymn-tune successful with the _ri_ _k_ (verse), the Rathantara with the\nGayatra (metre), and the B _ri_ hat, moving in Gayatra measures!'--thus the\nsamans (hymns);--'Hail!' thus the sacrificial formulas: this threefold science\nis first produced, even as it was there and then produced. And the Agni who\nwas produced, he is this Agni (fire-altar) who is built up from hence upwards.\n\n6:3:1:2121\\. These then are the eight Savitra (formulas 1);--the Gayatri has\neight syllables, and Agni is Gayatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, by just so much he pours him out as seed. There are nine of them, the\ncall of 'Hail' (being) the ninth,--there are nine regions, and Agni is the\nregions; nine vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as\ngreat as is. his measure, by so much he pours him out as seed. There are ten\nof them, the libation (being) the tenth,--the Vira _g_ has ten syllables, and\nAgni is Vira _g_ (the widely shining 2); there are ten regions, and Agni is\nthe regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is,\nas great as is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n6:3:1:2222\\. This libation having been offered, Agni went away from the gods.\nThe gods said, 'Agni is the\n\np. 197\n\ncattle (or, an animal), let us search for him by means of the (different kinds\nof) cattle: he will become manifest unto his own form.' They searched for him\nby means of the cattle, and he became manifest to his own form: and hence even\nto this day the animal becomes manifest to its own form (kind) 1, cow to cow,\nhorse to horse, and man to man.\n\n6:3:1:2323\\. They said, 'Surely, if we search with all of them, they will\nbecome used up and affording no livelihood; and if not with all, we shall get\nhim (Agni) incomplete.' They saw one animal (as a substitute) for two animals\n2, namely, the ass (as a substitute) for the cow and the sheep; and because\nthey saw that one beast (would do) for two beasts, therefore that one (the he-\nass), whilst being one, doubly impregnates 3.\n\n6:3:1:2424\\. The sham-man 4 (they saw to be a substitute) for man,--a sham-man\ndoubtless is he who pleases neither the gods, nor the fathers, nor men. Thus\nthey searched by means of all the beasts, and yet they (the beasts) did not\ncome to be used up and affording no livelihood.\n\n6:3:1:2525\\. With three he searches,--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is,\nas great as is his measure, with so much he thus searches for him. They are\nfive\n\np. 198\n\nby way of (mystic) correspondence 1,--Agni (the fire-altar) has five layers;\nfive seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great\nas is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n6:3:1:2626\\. They are fastened with halters of reed-grass to guard (Agni)\nagainst injury 2;--Agni went away from the gods; he entered into a reed,\nwhence it is hollow, and whence inside it is, as it were, smoke-tinged: (thus)\nthat, the reed, is Agni's womb, and Agni is these cattle; and the womb does\nnot injure the child. For 3 it is from a womb that he who is born is born:\n'from the womb he (Agni) shall be born when he is born,' thus he thinks.\n\n6:3:1:2727\\. They (the halters) are triple (strings), for Agni is threefold.\nThey are made like a horse's halter, for the horse's halter lies all round the\nmouth, and the womb lies all round the child: thus it is made like the womb.\n\n6:3:1:2828\\. They (the animals) stand facing the east, first the horse, then\nthe ass, then the he-goat; for this\n\np. 199\n\nis their proper order. For that horse (a _s_ va) is the tear (a _s_ ru) which\nthere (at the creation) formed itself; and that ass (rasabha) is that which,\nas it were, cried (ras); and that he-goat (a _g_ a, unborn) is the juice which\nadhered to the shell; and that clay which they are about to fetch is nothing\nelse than the shell (of the egg): for it was from these forms that he was\ncreated at first 1, and from them he thus produces him.\n\n6:3:1:2929\\. They stand on the south side;--for the gods at that time were\nafraid, lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should smite their sacrifice from the\nsouth. They saw that thunderbolt, yonder sun; for this horse is indeed yonder\nsun; and by means of that thunderbolt they drove off the Rakshas, the fiends,\nfrom the south, and spread this sacrifice in a place free from danger and\ndevilry. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now by this thunderbolt drive\noff the Rakshas, the fiends, from the south, and spread this sacrifice in a\nplace free from danger and devilry.\n\n6:3:1:3030\\. On the right (south) side is the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, and on the left\n(north) lies that spade; for the \xc3\x82havaniya (m.) is a male, and the spade\n(abhri, f.) a female, and the male lies on the right side of the female 2. [It\nlies] at a cubit's distance, for at a cubit's distance the male lies by the\nfemale.\n\n6:3:1:3131\\. It should be made of bamboo. Agni went away from the gods. He\nentered into a bamboo-stem; whence that is hollow. On both sides he made\nhimself those fences, the knots, so as not\n\np. 200\n\nto be found out; and wherever he burnt through, those spots came to be.\n\n6:3:1:3232\\. It (the spade) should be spotted, for such a one is of Agni's\nnature. If he cannot procure a spotted one, it may be unspotted, but hollow it\nmust be, to guard (Agni) from injury 1;--(for) such a one alone is of Agni's\nnature; that, the bamboo, is Agni's womb; and this (lump of) clay is Agni; and\nthe womb does not injure the child. For it is from a womb that he who is born\nis born: 'from the womb he (Agni) shall be born when he is born,' so he\nthinks.\n\n6:3:1:3333\\. It may be a span long, for the voice here speaks but as far as a\nspan's distance 2. It is, however, a cubit long, for the cubit is the arm, and\nstrength is exerted by the arm: it thus becomes equal to his strength.\n\n6:3:1:3434\\. It may be sharp on one side only, for on one of the two sides is\nthere a keen edge to this speech of ours 3. But indeed it is one that is sharp\non both sides, for on both sides is there a keen edge to this speech of curs,\ninasmuch as it speaks both what is divine and what is human 4, and both truth\nand untruth: therefore it is one that is sharp on both sides.\n\np. 201\n\n6:3:1:3535\\. And, again, why it is sharp on both sides,--the strength of the\nspade doubtless is on that side on which there is its sharp edge: he thus lays\nstrength into it on both sides.\n\n6:3:1:3636\\. And, again, why it is sharp on both sides,--when the gods had\nthere discovered him (Agni), they dug him out from these worlds; and in like\nmanner does he now, after discovering him, dig him out from these worlds.\n\n6:3:1:3737\\. When it digs thus (downwards), then it digs him out from this\nworld; and when it moves upwards, then from yonder world; and when it moves\nabout between the two, then from the air-world: it thus digs him out from all\nthese worlds.\n\n6:3:1:3838\\. He takes it up, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 9), 'At the impulse of the\ngod Savit _ri_ , I take thee by the arms of the A _s_ vins, by the hands of\nPushan, by the Gayatri metre, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like!' By means of those deities he thus\ntakes it up, impelled by Savit _ri_ ; by the Gayatri metre: he thus imparts\nthe Gayatri metre to it. 'From the Earth's seat, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, bring thou Agni\nPurishya 1!'--\n\np. 202\n\nnow soil means cattle: thus, 'from the earth's lap bring thou Agni, favourable\nto cattle, as Agni (did)!'--'by the Trish _t_ ubh metre, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like!' he\nthereby takes it with the Trish _t_ ubh metre and thus lays into it the Trish\n_t_ ubh metre.\n\n6:3:1:3939\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 10] 'A spade thou art,'--for a spade it is: he\nthus takes it by means of the truth;--'A woman thou art!'--the spade is a\nthunderbolt, and the woman is a female, and a female injures no one: he thus\nappeases it so as not to do any injury. 'By thee may we be able to dig out\nAgni in the seat!' the seat no doubt is this (spot): thus, 'By thee may we be\nable to dig out Agni in this seat (place).'--'By the _G_ agati metre, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-\nlike!' he thus takes it up by means of the _G_ agati metre, and lays the _G_\nagati metre into it.\n\n6:3:1:4040\\. With three (formulas) he takes it up,--threefold is Agni: as\ngreat as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus takes it.\nHaving taken it up with three (formulas), he addresses it with a fourth; for\nthe gods having thus taken it with three (formulas), then laid vigour into it\nby means of a fourth; and in like manner does he now, after taking it up with\nthree (formulas), lay strength into it with the fourth.\n\n6:3:1:4141\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 11] 'Having taken into his hand, Savit _ri_ ,'--\nfor it has indeed been taken into his (the Adhvaryu's) hand,--'bearing the\nspade,'--for he indeed bears it,--'the golden,'--for golden indeed is the one\nthat consists of the metres (the Veda);--'beholding Agni's light,'--that is,\nseeing Agni's light,--'lifted it up from the earth,'--for he indeed lifts it\nup from the earth;--'by the Anush _t_ ubh metre, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like;'--he thus takes\n\np. 203\n\nit up by means of the Anush _t_ ubh metre, and lays the Anush _t_ ubh metre\ninto it: for his undertaking that spade of bamboo is thus made to be those\nmetres.\n\n6:3:1:4242\\. Some, indeed, make it of gold, saying, 'It is spoken of as\ngolden.' Let him not do so: in that it is the metres, thereby that (spade) is\ngold, immortal gold, the immortal metres.\n\n6:3:1:4343\\. He takes it up with four (formulas), for all speech consists of\nfour syllables: 'vak' (speech) is one syllable, and 'aksharam' (syllable)\nconsists of three syllables. Now that monosyllable 'vak' is the same as this\nlast one, the Anush _t_ ubh; and that trisyllable 'aksharam' is the same as\nthose former formulas: he thus digs up Agni by the whole speech, and equips it\nwith the whole speech,--hence with four (formulas).\n\n6:3:1:4444\\. And, again, why with four (formulas);--there are four quarters:\nhe thus lays speech into the four quarters, whence speech speaks in the four\nquarters. He takes it up both by metres and by formulas, that makes eight--\nthere are four quarters, and four intermediate quarters: he thus lays speech\ninto all the quarters, whence speech speaks in all the quarters.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[190:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_394) That is, the 'invincible' brick, being the first\nbrick which is made, and that by the Sacrificer's chief wife (mahishi)\nherself.

The number\nof five is obtained by the three beasts actually led forward,--a horse, an\nass, and a he-goat--and the two beasts for which the ass was stated to be a\nsubstitute, viz. the cow (or bullock) and the sheep.--Saya _n_ a, whose\ncomment is very corrupt in this place, remarks,--nanaddhapurusho\xe0\xa4\xbdtra ga _n_\nyate.\n\n[198:2](sbe4134.htm#fr_407) In the text the dative of purpose ('ahi _m_\nsayai') is as usual shifted right to the end of the train of reasoning\nexplaining the _raison d 'etre_ of this item of the performance.\n\n[198:3](sbe4134.htm#fr_408) This final clause with 'vai' supplies the reason\nwhy Agni entered the womb, viz. because otherwise he could not be born;--just\nas the preceding clause with 'vai' (the womb does not injure the child)\nsupplies the reason why reed grass is used; whilst the preceding clauses\nexplain how the reed comes to be the womb whence Agni sprung.\n\n[199:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_409) See [VI, 1, 1, 11](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:11).\n\n[199:2](sbe4134.htm#fr_410) Dakshi _n_ ato vai v _ri_ sha yosham upa _s_\nete;--compare: uttarato hi stri puma _m_ sam upa _s_ ete, I, 1, 1, 20; II, 5,\n2, 17.\n\n[200:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_411) For the construction, see p. 198, note 2.\n\n[200:2](sbe4134.htm#fr_412) Prade _s_ amatra _m_ hida _m_ mukham abhi vag\nvadati, mukham abhi var _n_ atmika vag vadati vaktastis (?) tasya _s_ _k_ a\nprade _s_ amatratvam adhyatmavadharitam ato\xe0\xa4\xbdtrapi prade _s_ amatra . . .\nyukta, Say.\n\n[200:3](sbe4134.htm#fr_413) According to Saya _n_ a the tip of the tongue is\nindicated (as [VII, 2, 3, 3](sbe4159.htm#7:2:3:3); [2, 4,\n14](sbe4160.htm#7:2:4:14), 'va _k_ ' means 'mouth'); but perhaps it is rather\nsharp, vituperative speech addressed to another person that is intended here.\n\n[200:4](sbe4134.htm#fr_414) Saya _n_ a identifies the divine speech with Sa\n_m_ sk _ri_ t, and the human speech with the Apabhra _m_ _s_ as, or low\ndialects (? manusha _m_ _k_ apatro _s_ am, MS.).\n\n[201:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_415) Mahidhara says, Agni is called 'purishya,' because\nloose soil (purisha) is put in the fire-pan (ukha), on which the fire is then\nplaced. It also doubtless refers to the loose soil which is spread over the\ndifferent layers of the altar, thus serving as mortar to the bricks. In this\nepithet of Agni, 'purisha' seems, however, to be taken in yet another, more\nsubtle sense, the author apparently connecting with it its etymological\nmeaning of 'that which fills, fillings, Germ. Fullung, Fullsel;' whilst the\nreference to cattle might also seem to point to the later ordinary meaning,\n'faeces, manure.' Mahidhara, on the force of the symbolical identification 'pa\n_s_ avo vai purisham,' seems straightway to take 'purisha' as a synonym of 'pa\n_s_ u,' when he says,--purishebhya _h_ pa _s_ ubhyo hita _h_ purishya _h_.\nSaya _n_ a's comment here is corrupt,--pa _s_ avo vai purisha _m_ pura _n_\namuhi(?) karya _m_ pa _s_ ava _h_ purayanti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 3, 2.
