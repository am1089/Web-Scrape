And on account of the teaching of formation (i.e. creation) there is no\ncontradiction; as in the case of the honey.\n\nThe 'and' expresses disposal of a doubt that had arisen. There is no\ncontradiction between the Prak _ri_ ti being a _g_ a and originating from\nlight. On account of instruction being given about the formation (kalpana),\ni.e. creation of the world. This interpretation of 'kalpana' is in agreement\nwith the use of the verb k _li_ p in the text, 'as formerly the creator made\n(akalpayat) sun and moon.'\n\nIn our text the _s_ loka 'from that the Lord of Maya creates all this' gives\ninstruction about the creation of the world. From that, i.e. from matter in\nits subtle causal state when it is not yet divided, the Lord of all creates\nthe entire Universe. From this statement about creation we understand that\nPrak _ri_ ti exists in a twofold state according as it is either cause or\neffect. During a pralaya it unites itself with Brahman and abides in its\nsubtle state, without any distinction of names and forms; it then is called\nthe 'Unevolved,' and by other similar names. At the time of creation, on the\nother hand, there reveal themselves in Prak _ri_ ti Goodness and the other gu\n_n_ as, it divides itself according to names and forms, and then is called the\n'Evolved,' and so on, and, transforming itself into fire, water, and earth, it\nappears as red, white, and black. In its causal condition it is a _g_ a, i.e.\nunborn, in its effected condition it is 'caused by light, i.e. Brahman'; hence\nthere is no contradiction. The case is analogous to that of the 'honey.' The\nsun in his causal state is one only, but in his effected state the Lord makes\nhim into honey in so far namely as he then, for the purpose of enjoyment on\nthe part of the Vasus\n\np. 369\n\nand other gods, is the abode of nectar brought about by sacrificial works to\nbe learned from the _Ri_ k and the other Vedas; and further makes him to rise\nand to set. And between these two conditions there is no contradiction. This\nis declared in the Madhuvidya ( _Kh._ Up. III), from 'The sun is indeed the\nhoney of the Devas,' down to 'when from thence he has risen upwards he neither\nrises nor sets; being one he stands in the centre'--'one' here means 'of one\nnature.'--The conclusion therefore is that the _S_ vetasvatara mantra under\ndiscussion refers to Prak _ri_ ti as having her Self in Brahman, not to the\nPrak _ri_ ti assumed by the Sa _n_ khyas.\n\nOthers, however, are of opinion that the one a _g_ a of which the mantra\nspeaks has for its characteristics light, water, and earth. To them we address\nthe following questions. Do you mean that by what the text speaks of as an a\n_g_ a, consisting of fire, water, and earth, we have to understand those three\nelements only; or Brahman in the form of those three elements; or some power\nor principle which is the cause of the three elements? The first alternative\nis in conflict with the circumstance that, while fire, water, and earth are\nseveral things, the text explicitly refers to _one_ A _g_ a. Nor may it be\nurged that fire, water, and earth, although several, become one, by being made\ntripartite ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 3); for this making them tripartite, does not\ntake away their being several; the text clearly showing that each several\nelement becomes tripartite, 'Let me make each of these three divine beings\ntripartite.'--The second alternative again divides itself into two\nalternatives. Is the one a _g_ a Brahman in so far as having passed over into\nfire, water, and earth; or Brahman in so far as abiding within itself and not\npassing over into effects? The former alternative is excluded by the\nconsideration that it does not remove plurality (which cannot be reconciled\nwith the _one_ a _g_ a). The second alternative is contradicted by the text\ncalling that a _g_ a red, white, and black; and moreover Brahman viewed as\nabiding within itself cannot be characterised by fire, water, and earth. On\nthe third alternative it has to be assumed that the text denotes by the\n\np. 370\n\nterm 'a _g_ a' the three elements, and that on this basis there is imagined a\ncausal condition of these elements; but better than this assumption it\nevidently is to accept the term 'a _g_ a' as directly denoting the causal\nstate of those three elements as known from scripture.\n\nNor can we admit the contention that the term 'a _g_ a' is meant to teach that\nPrak _ri_ ti should metaphorically be viewed as a she-goat; for such a view\nwould be altogether purposeless. Where--in the passage 'Know the Self to be\nhim who drives in the chariot'--the body, and so on, are compared to a\nchariot, and so on, the object is to set forth the means of attaining Brahman;\nwhere the sun is compared to honey, the object is to illustrate the enjoyment\nof the Vasus and other gods; but what similar object could possibly be\nattained by directing us to view Prak _ri_ ti as a goat? Such a metaphorical\nview would in fact be not merely useless; it would be downright irrational.\nPrak _ri_ ti is a non-intelligent principle, the causal substance of the\nentire material Universe, and constituting the means for the experience of\npleasure and pain, and for the final release, of all intelligent souls which\nare connected with it from all eternity. Now it would be simply contrary to\ngood sense, metaphorically to transfer to Prak _ri_ ti such as described the\nnature of a she-goat--which is a sentient being that gives birth to very few\ncreatures only, enters only occasionally into connexion with others, is of\nsmall use only, is not the cause of herself being abandoned by others, and is\ncapable of abandoning those connected with her. Nor does it recommend itself\nto take the word a _g_ a. (understood to mean 'she-goat') in a sense different\nfrom that in which we understand the term 'a _g_ a' which occurs twice in the\nsame mantra.--Let then all three terms be taken in the same metaphorical sense\n(a _g_ a meaning he-goat).--It would be altogether senseless, we reply, to\ncompare the soul which absolutely dissociates itself from Prak _ri_ ti\n('Another a _g_ a leaves her after having enjoyed her') to a he-goat which is\nable to enter again into connexion with what he has abandoned, or with\nanything else.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the cup.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 11.
