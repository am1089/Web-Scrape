I told the servants to let\nme know as soon as he arrived, but could not keep still. At last I went\noutside to await him in the sitting-room.\n\nWhen I sent him off to sell the jewels I must have been thinking only of\nmyself. It never even crossed my mind that so young a boy, trying to sell such\nvaluable jewellery, would at once be suspected. So helpless are we women, we\nneeds must place on others the burden of our danger. When we go to our death\nwe drag down those who are about us.\n\nI had said with pride that I would save Amulya--as if she who was drowning\ncould save others. But instead of saving him, I have sent him to his doom. My\nlittle brother, such a sister have I been to you that Death must have smiled\non that Brothers\' Day when I gave you my blessing--I, who wander distracted\nwith the burden of my own evil-doing.\n\nI feel today that man is at times attacked with evil as with the plague. Some\ngerm finds its way in from somewhere, and then in the space of one night Death\nstalks in. Why cannot the stricken one be kept far away from the rest of the\nworld? I, at least, have realized how terrible is the contagion--like a fiery\ntorch which burns that it may set the world on fire.\n\nIt struck nine. I could not get rid of the idea that Amulya was in trouble,\nthat he had fallen into the clutches of the police. There must be great\nexcitement in the Police Office--whose are the jewels?--where did he get them?\nAnd in the end I shall have to furnish the answer, in public, before all the\nworld.\n\nWhat is that answer to be? Your day has come at last, Bara Rani, you whom I\nhave so long despised. You, in the shape of the public, the world, will have\nyour revenge. O God, save me this time, and I will cast all my pride at my\nsister-in-law\'s feet.\n\nI could bear it no longer. I went straight to the Bara Rani. She was in the\nverandah, spicing her betel leaves, Thako at her side. The sight of Thako made\nme shrink back for a moment, but I overcame all hesitation, and making a low\nobeisance I took the dust of my elder sister-in-law\'s feet.\n\n"Bless my soul, Chota Rani," she exclaimed, "what has come upon you? Why this\nsudden reverence?"\n\n"It is my birthday, sister," said I. "I have caused you pain. Give me your\nblessing today that I may never do so again. My mind is so small." I repeated\nmy obeisance and left her hurriedly, but she called me back.\n\n"You never before told me that this was your birthday, Chotie darling! Be sure\nto come and have lunch with me this afternoon. You positively must."\n\nO God, let it really be my birthday today. Can I not be born over again?\nCleanse me, my God, and purify me and give me one more trial!\n\nI went again to the sitting-room to find Sandip there. A feeling of disgust\nseemed to poison my very blood. The face of his, which I saw in the morning\nlight, had nothing of the magic radiance of genius.\n\n"Will you leave the room," I blurted out.\n\nSandip smiled. "Since Amulya is not here," he remarked, "I should think my\nturn had come for a special talk."\n\nMy fate was coming back upon me. How was I to take away the right I myself had\ngiven. "I would be alone," I repeated.\n\n"Queen," he said, "the presence of another person does not prevent your being\nalone. Do not mistake me for one of the crowd. I, Sandip, am always alone,\neven when surrounded by thousands."\n\n"Please come some other time. This morning I am ..."\n\n"Waiting for Amulya?"\n\nI turned to leave the room for sheer vexation, when Sandip drew out from the\nfolds of his cloak that jewel-casket of mine and banged it down on the marble\ntable. I was thoroughly startled. "Has not Amulya gone, then?" I exclaimed.\n\n"Gone where?"\n\n"To Calcutta?"\n\n"No," chuckled Sandip.\n\nAh, then my blessing had come true, in spite of all. He was saved. Let God\'s\npunishment fall on me, the thief, if only Amulya be safe.\n\nThe change in my countenance roused Sandip\'s scorn. "So pleased, Queen!"\nsneered he. "Are these jewels so very precious? How then did you bring\nyourself to offer them to the Goddess? Your gift was actually made. Would you\nnow take it back?"\n\nPride dies hard and raises its fangs to the last. It was clear to me I must\nshow Sandip I did not care a rap about these jewels. "If they have excited\nyour greed," I said, "you may have them."\n\n"My greed today embraces the wealth of all Bengal," replied Sandip. "Is there\na greater force than greed? It is the steed of the great ones of the earth, as\nis the elephant, Airauat, the steed of Indra. So then these jewels are mine?"\n\nAs Sandip took up and replaced the casket under his cloak, Amulya rushed in.\nThere were dark rings under his eyes, his lips were dry, his hair tumbled: the\nfreshness of his youth seemed to have withered in a single day. Pangs gripped\nmy heart as I looked on him.\n\n"My box!" he cried, as he went straight up to Sandip without a glance at me.\n"Have you taken that jewel-box from my trunk?"\n\n"Your jewel-box?" mocked Sandip.\n\n"It was my trunk!"\n\nSandip burst out into a laugh. "Your distinctions between mine and yours are\ngetting rather thin, Amulya," he cried. "You will die a religious preacher\nyet, I see."\n\nAmulya sank on a chair with his face in his hands. I went up to him and\nplacing my hand on his head asked him: "What is your trouble, Amulya?"\n\nHe stood straight up as he replied: "I had set my heart, Sister Rani, on\nreturning your jewels to you with my own hand. Sandip Babu knew this, but he\nforestalled me."\n\n"What do I care for my jewels?" I said. "Let them go. No harm is done.\n\n"Go? Where?" asked the mystified boy.\n\n"The jewels are mine," said Sandip. "Insignia bestowed on me by my Queen!"\n\n"No, no, no," broke out Amulya wildly. "Never, Sister Rani! I brought them\nback for you. You shall not give them away to anybody else."\n\n"I accept your gift, my little brother," said I. "But let him, who hankers\nafter them, satisfy his greed."\n\nAmulya glared at Sandip like a beast of prey, as he growled: "Look here,\nSandip Babu, you know that even hanging has no terrors for me. If you dare\ntake away that box of jewels ..."\n\nWith an attempt at a sarcastic laugh Sandip said: "You also ought to know by\nthis time, Amulya, that I am not the man to be afraid of you."\n\n"Queen Bee," he went on, turning to me, "I did not come here today to take\nthese jewels, I came to give them to you. You would have done wrong to take my\ngift at Amulya\'s hands. In order to prevent it, I had first to make them\nclearly mine. Now these my jewels are my gift to you. Here they are! Patch up\nany understanding with this boy you like. I must go. You have been at your\nspecial talks all these days together, leaving me out of them. If special\nhappenings now come to pass, don\'t blame me.\n\n"Amulya," he continued, "I have sent on your trunks and things to your\nlodgings. Don\'t you be keeping any belongings of yours in my room any longer."\nWith this parting shot, Sandip flung out of the room.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIX](hw42.htm)\n\n'
