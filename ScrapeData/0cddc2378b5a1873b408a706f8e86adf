A _S_ raddha offered at the (Tirtha or place of pilgrimage called)\nPushkaras confers eternal bliss upon the giver;\n\n2\\. And so does the muttering of prayers, the offering of burnt-oblations, and\nthe practice of austerities in that place.\n\n3\\. Even by merely bathing at Pushkara he is purified from all his sins.\n\n4\\. The same effect may be produced at _G_ aya _s_ irsha;\n\n5\\. And near Va _t_ a (Akshayava _t_ a);\n\n6\\. And on the Amaraka _nt_ aka mountain;\n\n7\\. And on the Varaha mountain;\n\n[LXXXV. 1. Pushkara, according to the common acceptation of the term, is the\nname of a celebrated place of pilgrimage near A _g_ mir, the modern Pokur. See\nLassen, Indian Antiquities, I, 113. Nand. quotes a Smriti passage to the\neffect that there are three Pushkaras, and a passage of the Mahabharata, in\nwhich it is stated that one Pushkara is sacred to Brahman, another to Vish _n_\nu, and a third to Rudra.\n\n3\\. Nand. asserts with regard to the use of the name Pushkara in the singular\nnumber in this Sutra, that it means even a single bath has the consequence\nhere mentioned.\n\n4\\. Gaya _s_ irsha is the name of a mountain near Gaya in Bihar, a celebrated\nplace of pilgrimage. Compare Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya I, 260.\n\n5\\. There exists one Akshayava _t_ a in Bihar (Nand.) and another in Prayaga\n(Allahabad). The 'undecaying banyan-tree' (Aksbay Ba _t_ ) is an object of\nworship at Allahabad even now, and was so already in the times of Hwen Thsang.\nSee Cunningham, Ancient Geography of India, p. 389; St. Julien, Voyages des\nPelerins Bouddhistes, II, 278.\n\n6\\. Nand. states that both the Tirtha called Amaraka _nt_ aka on the Mekala\nmountain in the Vindhya range and the whole mountain of that name are meant.\n\n7\\. 'This is a certain boar shaped mountain.' (Nand.) It seems very probable\nthat the Tirtha of Baramula, the ancient Varahamula {footnote p. 257} in Ka\n_s_ mir, is meant. See Buhler, Ka _s_ mir Report, p. 12, where a 'Varaha hill'\nis mentioned as adjacent to that town.]\n\np. 257\n\n8\\. And anywhere on the bank of the Narmada (Nerbudda) river;\n\n9\\. And on the bank of the Yamuna (Jumna);\n\n10\\. And, particularly, on the Ga _n_ ga;\n\n11\\. And at Ku _s_ avarta;\n\n12\\. And at Binduka; 13. And upon the Nilgiri hills; 14. And at Kanakhala; 15.\nAnd at Kub _g_ amra; 16. And on the Bh _ri_ gutu _n_ ga (mountain); 17. And at\nKedara; 18. And on the Mahalaya (mountain); 19. And on the Na _d_ antika\n(river); 20. And on the Sugandha (river); 21. And at _S_ akambhari; 22. And at\nPhalgutirtha; 23. And on the\n\n[11. This Tirtha 'is situated upon the mountain called Tryambaka, where the\nGodavari river takes its rise.' (Nand.) Tryambaka is the modern Trimbak (the\nname of a place of pilgrimage situated near Nasik).\n\n12\\. 'Binduka is the name of a Tirtha in the Dekhan. Bilvaka, as other texts\nread (the MS. on which the two Calcutta editions are based among the number),\nis the name of another Tirtha in the Dekhan.' (Nand.)\n\n14\\. There is one Kanakhala in the Himalayas, and another near Trimbak.\n(Nand.)\n\n15\\. There is one plain of that name in Orissa, and another in Haridvar.\n(Nand.)\n\n16\\. This is the name of a sacred mountain near the Amaraka _nt_ aka range,\naccording to Nand.; in the Himalayas, according to others. See the Petersburg\nDictionary.\n\n17\\. Kedara (the Kedar mountains?) is in the Himalayas. (Nand.)\n\n18, 19. These two names are not defined by Nand.\n\n20\\. This is a river in the vicinity of the Saugandhika mountain. (Nand.)\n\n21\\. _S_ akambhari is the modern Shambar, which lies 'in the desert of Marude\n_s_ a, on the salt lake.' (Nand.)\n\n22\\. 'Phalgutirtha is a Tirtha in Gaya.' (Nand.)\n\n23\\. Mahaga _n_ ga, 'the great Ga _n_ ga,' is the Alakananda river {footnote\np. 258} (Nand.), which takes its rise in the Himalayas and falls into the\nGanges.]\n\np. 258\n\nMahaga _n_ ga; 24. And at Trihalikagrama; 25. And at Kumaradhara; 26. And at\nPrabhasa; 2 7. And particularly anywhere on (the bank of) the Sarasvati;\n\n28\\. At Ga _n_ gadvara (Haridvar), at Prayaga (Allahabad), where the Ga _n_ ga\nfalls into the ocean, constantly in the Naimisha forest, and especially at\nBenares;\n\n29\\. And at Agastya _s_ rama;\n\n30\\. And at Ka _n_ va _s_ rama (on the Malini river);\n\n31\\. And on the Kau _s_ iki (Kosi river);\n\n32\\. And on the bank of the Sarayu (Surju river in Oudh);\n\n33\\. And on the confluence of the So _n_ a (Sone) and Gyotisha rivers;\n\n34\\. And on the Sriparvata (mountain);\n\n[24. 'Trihalikagrama means _S_ alagrama. There is another reading, Ta _nd_\nulika _s_ rama.' (Nand.)\n\n25\\. This is the name of a lake in Ka _s_ mir, which the god Kumara by a\nmighty stroke caused to stream forth from the Krau\xc3\xb1 _k_ a mountain (see Vayu-\npura _n_ a); or Kumaradhara is situated near the southern ocean in the plain\nof Ishupata. (Nand.)\n\n26\\. Prabhasa is the name of a Tirtha near Dvaraka, on the western point of\nKattivar. (Nand.)\n\n27\\. Regarding the river Sarasvati and its reputed holiness, see particularly\nCunningham, Ancient Geography of India, I, 331 seq., and Manu II, 17.\n\n28\\. The Naimisha forest is in the northern country. (Nand.)\n\n29\\. 'Agastya _s_ rama is situated near Pushkara (Sutra 1), on the bank of the\nSarasvati. There is another Agastya _s_ rama in the south, near Svamisthana.'\n(Nand.)\n\n33\\. The confluence of those two rivers is in the centre of the Vindhya range.\nFor the name of the second, another reading is _G_ yotiratha. (Nand.)\n\n34\\. The _S_ riparvata or _S_ ri _s_ aila, where the Mallikar _g_ una (symbol\nof _S_ iva) is worshipped, is in the Dekhan. (Nand.)]\n\np. 259\n\n35\\. And at (the Tirtha situated on the Yamuna, which is called) Kalodaka.\n\n36\\. And at Uttaramanasa (in the Kedar mountains, in the Himalayas).\n\n37\\. And at Va _d_ ava (in the Dekhan).\n\n38\\.

And on the banks of the Indus;\n\n51\\. And on the southern Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ anada;\n\n52\\. And at Ausa _g_ a (?);\n\n53\\. And at other such Tirthas;\n\n[39. Saptarsha, 'the Tirtha of the seven _Ri_ shis' (Nand.), is perhaps the\npresent Satara, in the country of the Mahrattas.\n\n40\\. Nand. places this Tirtha in the centre of Gaya. There is another of the\nsame name, which is placed on the Kailasa mountain.\n\n43\\. The Gomati (the Gunti, near Lucknow) rises in the Naimisha forest.\n(Nand.) See 28.\n\n44: The Vetravati (the modern Betwah, near Bhilsah) is situated in Ahi _kkh_\nattra. (Nand.)\n\n45-49. The Vipa _s_ a (Beas), Vitasta (Jhelum or Behut), _S_ atadru (Sutlej),\n_K_ andrabhaga (Chenab), and \xc3\x8eravati (Ravee) are the five rivers of the Pa\xc3\xb1\n_g_ ab (Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ anada in Sanskrit).\n\n51\\. This is the name of the confluence of five rivers in the Dekhan: the K\n_ri_ shna, Ve _n_ a, Tu _n_ ga, Bhadra, and Ko _n_ a. (Nand.)\n\n52\\. 'Ausa _g_ a (v. 1. Au _g_ asa; read Au _s_ i _g_ a?) means _S_ urparaka'\n(Nand.), which was situated probably on the mouth of the K _ri_ sh _n_ a\n(Kistna).]\n\np. 260\n\n54\\. And on the banks of (other) holy rivers;\n\n55\\. And anywhere at the birth-place of a deity, (such as Rama, K _ri_ sh _n_\na, and others);\n\n56\\. And on sand-banks; 57. And near waterfalls; 58. And on mountains; 59. And\nin arbours (the sporting-places of K _ri_ sh _n_ a); 60. And in woods; 61. And\nin groves; 62. And in houses smeared with cow-dung, 63. And in 'pleasant\nspots.'\n\n64\\. There are some stanzas recited by the manes, which refer to this subject:\n\n65\\. 'May that person be born to our race, who will give us libations of\nwater, taken from streams abounding with water, especially if their floods\n(coming from the Himalayas) are cool.\n\n66\\. 'May that excellent man be born to our race, who offers us a _S_ raddha\nattentively at Gaya _s_ irsha or at Va _t_ a.'\n\n67\\. A man must wish to have many sons, because if only one of them goes to\nGaya (and offers a Sraddha to him after his death), or if he performs a horse-\nsacrifice, or if he sets a dark-coloured bull at liberty[1], (he will acquire\nfinal emancipation through him.)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXXXVI.](sbe07088.htm)\n\n"
