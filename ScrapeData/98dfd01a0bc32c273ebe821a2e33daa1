And because the objection (raised against our view) lies against his (the\nopponent's) view likewise.\n\nThose also who maintain that the world has sprung from the pradhana implicitly\nteach that something not made up of parts, unlimited, devoid of sound and\nother qualities--viz. the pradhana--is the cause of an effect--viz. the world\n--which is made up of parts, is limited and is characterised by the named\nqualities. Hence it follows from that doctrine also either that the pradhana\nas not consisting of parts has to undergo a change in its entirety, or else\nthat the view of its not consisting of parts has to be abandoned.--But--it\nmight be pleaded in favour of the Sa _n_ khyas--they do not maintain their\npradhana to be without parts; for they define it as the state of equilibrium\nof the three gu _n_ as, Goodness, Passion, and Darkness, so that the pradhana\nforms a whole containing the three gu _n_ as as its parts.--We reply that such\na partiteness as is here proposed does not remove the objection in hand\nbecause still each of the three qualities is declared to be in itself without\nparts 1. And each gu _n_ a by itself assisted merely by the two other gu _n_\nas constitutes the material cause of that part of the world which resembles it\nin its nature 2.--So that the objection lies against the Sa _n_ khya\n\np. 354\n\nview likewise.--Well, then, as the reasoning (on which the doctrine of the\nimpartiteness of the pradhana rests) is not absolutely safe, let us assume\nthat the pradhana consists of parts.--If you do that, we reply, it follows\nthat the pradhana cannot be eternal, and so on.--Let it then be said that the\nvarious powers of the pradhana to which the variety of its effects is pointing\nare its parts.--Well, we reply, those various powers are admitted by us also\nwho see the cause of the world in Brahman.\n\nThe same objections lie against the doctrine of the world having originated\nfrom atoms. For on that doctrine one atom when combining with another must, as\nit is not made up of parts, enter into the combination with its whole extent,\nand as thus no increase of bulk takes place we do not get beyond the first\natom  1 If, on the other hand, you maintain that the atom enters into the\ncombination with a part only, you offend against the assumption of the atoms\nhaving no parts.\n\nAs therefore all views are equally obnoxious to the objections raised, the\nlatter cannot be urged against any one view in particular, and the advocate of\nBrahman has consequently cleared his doctrine.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[353:1](sbe34168.htm#fr_310) So that if it undergoes modifications it must\neither change in its entirety, or else--against the assumption--consist of\nparts.\n\n[353:2](sbe34168.htm#fr_311) The last clause precludes the justificatory\nremark that the stated difficulties can be avoided if we assume the three gu\n_n_ as in combination only to undergo modification; if this were so the\ninequality of the different effects could not be accounted for.\n\n[354:1](sbe34168.htm#fr_312) As an atom has no parts it cannot enter into\npartial contact with another, and the only way in which the two can combine is\nentire interpenetration; in consequence of which the compound of two atoms\nwould not occupy more space than one atom.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 30](sbe34169.htm)\n\n"
