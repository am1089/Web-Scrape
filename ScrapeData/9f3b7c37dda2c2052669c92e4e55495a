If it be said that there results a contradiction to work; we deny this,\non account of the observation of the assumption of several (bodies).\n\nAn objection here presents itself. If we admit the gods to have bodies, a\ndifficulty arises at the sacrifices, as it is impossible that one and the same\ncorporeal Indra--who is at the same time invited by many sacrificers 'come,\n\np. 331\n\n[paragraph continues] O Indra', 'come, O Lord of the red horses,' &c.--should\nbe present at all those places. And that the gods, Agni and so on, really do\ncome to the sacrifices is proved by the following scriptural text: 'To whose\nsacrifice do the gods go, and to whose not? He who first receives the gods,\nsacrifices to them on the following day' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 6, 7, 1). In\nrefutation of this objection the Suutra points out that there is seen, i.e.\nrecorded, the assumption of several bodies at the same time, on the part of\nbeings endowed with special powers, such as Saubhari.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 27.
