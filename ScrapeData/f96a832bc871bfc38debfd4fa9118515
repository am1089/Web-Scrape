A Brahma _n_ a who always carries water (in his pot), who always wears the\nsacred thread, who daily recites the Veda, who avoids the food of _S_ udras,\nwho approaches (his wife) in the proper season, and offers sacrifices in\naccordance with the rules (of the Veda, after death) never falls from\nBrahman\'s heaven. 1\n\n2\\. The Veda (says), \'Manu divided his estate among his sons.\' 2\n\n3\\. (A father may, therefore, divide his property) equally among all, without\n(making any) difference; 3\n\n4\\. Or the eldest may receive the most excellent chattel. 4\n\n5\\. (For) the Veda says, \'Therefore, they distinguish the eldest by (an\nadditional share of the) property. 5\n\n6\\. Or the eldest may receive (in excess) one part out of ten; 6\n\n7\\. (And) the other (sons) shall receive equal shares. 7\n\n8\\. While the father lives, the division of the estate takes place (only) with\nthe permission of the father. 8\n\np. 225\n\n9\\. The (additional) share of the eldest is, (according to the order) of the\nfour castes, a cow, a horse, a goat, and a sheep. 9\n\n10\\. If there are sons born of wives of different castes (var _n_ a), they\nshould make ten portions of the ancestral property and take four (shares),\nthree, two, (and) one, according to the order (of the castes). 10\n\n11\\. But if a legitimate son of the body (aurasa) is born, the (other) sons of\nequal caste shall obtain one third share (of the estate). 11\n\n12\\. If there is a son of equal caste and a son of 12\n\np. 226\n\na wife of the next lower caste, the son born of the wife of the next lower\ncaste may take the share of the eldest, provided he be endowed with good\nqualities.\n\n13\\. (A son) who possesses good qualities becomes the protector of the rest.\n13\n\n14\\. One must know a son begotten by (the husband) himself on a wedded wife of\nequal caste (to be) a legitimate son of the body (aurasa). 14\n\nNow they quote also (the following verse): \'From the several limbs (of my\nbody) art thou produced, from my heart art thou born; thou art "self" called a\nson; mayest thou live a hundred autumns.\' 15\n\n15\\. The (male child) born of a daughter, after an agreement has been made,\n(one must know to be) the son of an appointed daughter (putrikaputra); any\nother (male offspring of a daughter they call) a daughter\'s son (dauhitra).\n\n16\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): \'The son of an appointed\ndaughter should offer the first funeral cake to his mother, the second to her\nfather, and the third to his father\'s father.\'\n\n17\\. He who is begotten, by another man, on the wife of a deceased man, of a\neunuch, or of one (incurably) diseased, after permission (has been given), is\ncalled the son begotten on a wife (kshetra _g_ a). 17\n\np. 227\n\n18\\. Such a (son begotten on a wife) has two fathers and belongs to two\nfamilies; he has a right to perform the funeral oblations, and to inherit the\nproperty of (his) two (fathers). 18\n\n19\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): The son of two fathers shall\ngive the funeral cakes (to his two fathers, and pronounce) two names with each\noblation, and three cakes shall serve for six persons; he who acts thus will\nnot err.\'\n\n20\\. He (is called) an adopted son (datta) who, being given by his father and\nhis mother, or by either of the two, is received in the place of a child. 20\n\n21\\. He (is called) a son made (k _ri_ trima) whom (a mail) himself makes (his\nson), with the (adoptee\'s) consent (only), and who belongs to the same caste\n(as the adopter). 21\n\n22\\. He is called a son born secretly (gu _dh_ agga) who is secretly born in\nthe house and whose (origin is) afterwards (only) recognised. 22\n\n23\\. He is called a son cast off (apaviddha) who, being, cast off by his\nfather and his mother, or by either (of them), is received in the place of a\nchild. 23\n\n24\\. If anybody approaches an unmarried girl without the permission (of her\nfather or guardian), the son born by such (a woman is called) the son of an\nunmarried damsel (kanina). 24\n\np. 228\n\n25\\. If one marries either knowingly or unknowingly a pregnant bride, the\nchild which is born of her is called (a son) taken with the bride (saho _dh_\na). 25\n\n26\\. He (is called a son) bought (krita) who, being purchased from his father\nand his mother, or from either of them, is received in the place of a child.\n26\n\n27\\. He (is called the son) of a twice-married woman (paunarbhava) who is born\nof a re-married female, (i.e.) of one who, having left an impotent man, has\ntaken a second husband. 27\n\n28\\. He (is called) a self-given (son, svaya _m_ datta) who, abandoned by his\nfather and his mother, gives himself (to a stranger). 28\n\n29\\. He who is begotten by (a man of) the first twice-born (caste) on a female\nof the _S_ udra caste (is called) a Nishada.\n\n30\\. (He who was begotten by the same parents) through lust (is called) a Para\n_s_ ava. Thus (the various kinds of) sons (have been enumerated). 30\n\n31\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): \'They declare the legitimate\nson, the son of an appointed daughter, the son begotten on a wife, the adopted\nson and the son made, the son born secretly and the son cast off, (to be\nentitled) to share the inheritance.\' 31\n\n32\\. \'They declare the son of an unmarried damsel and the son received with\nthe bride, the son bought, 32\n\np. 229\n\nlikewise the son of a twice-married female, the son self-given and the\nNishada, to be members of the family.\'\n\n33\\. Aupa _g_ andhani (declares that) the first among them alone (is entitled\nto inherit, and a member of his father\'s family). 33\n\n34\\. \'Now, O _G_ anaka, I jealously watch my wives, (though I did) not (do it)\nformerly; for they have declared in Yama\'s court that the son belongs to the\nbegetter. The giver of the seed carries off the son, after death, in Yama\'s\nhall, Therefore they carefully protect their wives, fearing the seed of\nstrangers.\'\n\n35\\. \'Carefully watch (the procreation of your) offspring, lest strange seed\nfall on your soil. After death the son belongs to the begetter; through\ncarelessness a husband makes (the procreation of) a son useless.\'\n\n36\\. Let them carefully protect the shares of 36\n\np. 230\n\nthose who are minors, as well as the increments (thereon).\n\n37\\. Granting food, clothes, (and shelter), they shall support those who are\nincapable of transacting legal business, 37\n\n38\\. (Viz.) the blind, idiots, those immersed in vice, the incurably diseased,\nand so forth, 38\n\n39\\. Those who neglect their duties and occupations; 39\n\n40\\. But not the outcast nor his offspring. 40\n\n41\\. Intercourse with outcasts shall not take place.\n\n42\\. But he shall support an outcast mother, without speaking to her.\n\n43\\. The daughters shall obtain the ornaments of their mother, (as many as\nare) presented according to the custom (of the caste), or anything else (that\nmay be given according to custom). 43\n\np. 231\n\n44\\. Women do not possess independence. 44\n\n45\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): Their father protects (them)\nin childhood, their husband protects (them) in youth, and their sons protect\n(them) in old age a woman is never fit for independence.\' 45\n\n46\\. The Veda declares, \'Therefore women are considered to be destitute of\nstrength and of a portion.\' 46\n\np. 232\n\n47\\. Those (women) who strive (to do what is) agreeable to their husbands will\ngain heaven. 47\n\n48\\. But for a violation (of their duty towards the husband) a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_\nra penance (must be performed). 48\n\n49\\. (For violating it) with a _S_ udra (a woman) shall perform a lunar\npenance ( _k_ andraya _n_ a);\n\n50\\. (For violating it) against the order of the castes with a Vai _s_ ya and\nso forth, she shall perform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra or an (Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra)\npenance.\n\n51\\. For male (offenders, i.e.) Brahma _n_ as and so forth, a year\'s chastity\n(is prescribed). 51\n\np. 233\n\n52\\. Let him burn a _S_ udra (who commits adultery with an \xc3\x82ryan) in a straw-\nfire. 52\n\n53\\. Now they quote also (the following verses):\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[224:1](sbe1457.htm#fr_1107) **3**. Vasish _th_ a VIII, 17.\n\n[224:2](sbe1457.htm#fr_1108) Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita III, 1, 9, 4.\n\n[224:3](sbe1457.htm#fr_1109) Colebrooke V, Dig. XL. Govinda points out that\nthis rule refers to sons equal by caste, origin, and virtue.\n\n[224:4](sbe1457.htm#fr_1110) Colebrooke, loc. cit.; Vish _n_ u XVIII, 37.\n\n[224:5](sbe1457.htm#fr_1111) Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita II, 5, 2, 7.

XXII; Dayabhaga II, 8. In C.\'s\nDigest p. 225 the first clause is omitted and connected with the following\nSutra. Govinda agrees with _G_ imutavahana.\n\n[225:9](sbe1457.htm#fr_1115) Colebrooke V, Dig. XLIX. The rule is an\nexplanation of the term vara _m_ rupam, \'the most excellent chattel,\' in Sutra\n4. The meaning probably is, as the Digest states, that among Brahma _n_ as it\nis usual to give to the eldest a bull, among Kshatriyas a horse, and so forth.\n\n[225:10](sbe1457.htm#fr_1116) Vasish _th_ a XVII, 48-50; Vish _n_ u XVIII,\n2-40 where the several cases that can arise have been fully worked out.\n\n[225:11](sbe1457.htm#fr_1117) I translate according to the reading of K., M.,\nand the two MSS. of the commentary, aurase tutpanne savar _n_ as [\xc2\xb0 _n_ as,\nM., K.] t _ri_ ttya _m_ _s_ ahara _h_ [\xc2\xb0ya _m_ _s_ a _m_ haret, K.] The other\nMSS. omit the last two words of the Sutra. The sense of the Sutra seems to be,\nthat subsidiary sons of equal caste obtain a third of the estate when a\nlegitimate son of the body is born to their father; see also Katyayana V, Dig.\nCCXVIII. Govinda gives the following explanation: aurasa _h_ savar _n_ aputra\n_s_ _k_ a vakshyante | aurasa _h_ savar _n_ aya _m_ sa _m_ _s_ k _ri_ taya _m_\nsvayam utpa _d_ ita _h_ [Sutra 14] | tasminnutpanne savar _n_ as t _ri_ tiya\n_m_ _s_ ahara bhaveyu _h_ | sarva _m_ dhana _g_ ata _m_ tredha vibha _g_ ya\ntesham eka _m_ sho _d_ a _s_ a sa _m_ padya trin dvavekam iti kalpayet || \'The\nlegitimate son and the sons of equal caste will be described (below). He is\ncalled a legitimate son who is begotten by the husband himself on a wedded\nwife of equal caste. When such a one is born, the (other) sons of equal caste\nshall obtain one third share. Dividing the whole property into three parts,\nand making one of them sixteen (?), he shall give three, two, one.\'--Govinda.\n\n[225:12](sbe1457.htm#fr_1118) Colebrooke V, Dig.

CCXCIII. Govinda points out\nthat the Para _s_ ava is, according to Baudhayana, the offspring of a _S_ udra\nconcubine, not of a _S_ udra wife. But see also above, I, 9, 17, 4.\n\n[228:31](sbe1457.htm#fr_1134) Colebrooke V, Dig. CLXXX; Vasish _th_ a XVII,\n25.\n\n[228:32](sbe1457.htm#fr_1135) Colebrooke V, Dig. CLXXIX; Vasish _th_ a XVII,\n26.\n\n[229:33](sbe1457.htm#fr_1136)-34. Aupa _g_ andhani is one of the ancient\nteachers of the White Ya _g_ ur-veda, mentioned in the lists incorporated in\nthe _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a XIV, 5, 5, 21; 7, 3, 26. The legends of the\nWhite Ya _g_ ur-veda frequently mention king _G_ anaka of Videha, and assert\nthat that philosopher king had frequent and intimate intercourse with Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and other teachers of the Veda which \xc3\x82ditya revealed. It seems to\nme, therefore, highly probable that Govinda is right in taking the vocative\n_g_ anaka in Sutra 34 as a proper name, and in asserting that the verse\nbelongs to a conversation between Aupa _g_ andhani and _G_ anaka. This\nexplanation, which possibly may be based on an ancient tradition of\nBaudhayana\'s school, is certainly preferable to Haradatta\'s statement on\n\xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 13, 7, that these verses express the sentiments of a husband\nwho had neglected to watch his wives, and later learned that he would not\nderive any spiritual benefit from their offspring. In the text of Sutra 34 I\nread with the Dekhan MSS. and \xc3\x82pastamba, loc. cit., irshyami, instead of\nishyami, which M. and the commentary give.\n\n[229:36](sbe1457.htm#fr_1137) Colebrooke V, Dig. CCCCLII; Vasish _th_ a XVI,\n8, 9. \'The p. 230 increments, i.e. the proper interest. Thus the money of\nminors shall bear interest,\'--Govinda.\n\n[230:37](sbe1457.htm#fr_1138) Colebrooke V, Dig. CCCXXVIII; Dayabhaga V, 12;\nVyavaharamayukha IV, 11, so; Vasish _th_ a XVII, 52-54.\n\n[230:38](sbe1457.htm#fr_1139) Colebrooke and Mayukha, loc. cit. \'The\nexpression "and so forth" includes hunchbacks and other (disabled) persons.\'--\nGovinda. Vyasanin, \'immersed in vice,\' may also mean \'afflicted by\ncalamities,\' and is perhaps intended to be taken both ways.\n\n[230:39](sbe1457.htm#fr_1140) Colebrooke and Mayukha, loc. cit. Akarmi _n_ as,\n\'those who neglect their duties and occupations,\' I.e. those who though able\n(to fulfil their duties are) indolent.--Govinda.\n\n[230:40](sbe1457.htm#fr_1141) Colebrooke and Mayukha, loc. cit.; Burnell,\nDayabhaga 49. 42, Gautama XXI, 15, and note.\n\n[230:43](sbe1457.htm#fr_1142) Colebrooke V, Dig. CXXX; Vasish _th_ a XVII, 46.\n\'Sampradayikam (literally "customary") qualifies (the word) ornaments;\nsampradayikam (means) what is obtained according to custom; what is given to\ntheir mother by the maternal grandfather and grandmother, that (is called)\nsampradayikam. "Or anything else," (viz.) presented according to custom,\n(e.g.) a bedstead and the p. 231 like, a couch, and an outer garment, and the\nlike. So much and nothing else shall the daughters receive.\'--Govinda.\n\n[231:44](sbe1457.htm#fr_1143) Vasish _th_ a V, s. All the MSS. of the text\nread na strisvatantrya _m_ vidyate, while the text given by the two copies of\nthe commentary has na stri svatantrya _m_ vindate. Govinda asserts that the\nSutra is intended to forbid the independent action of women with respect to\nthings inherited. The correct view probably is that with this Sutra the topic\nof the duties and rights of women begins, and that the rule contains a general\nmaxim.\n\n[231:45](sbe1457.htm#fr_1144) Vasish _th_ a V, 2.\n\n[231:46](sbe1457.htm#fr_1145) Colebrooke V, Dig. CXXXI. The text is in great\nconfusion. The Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS., except K., read, na daya _m_\nnirindriya hyadaya _s_ _k_ a striyo mata iti sruti _h_ ; K. has,\ntasmat[n]nirindriya hy. st. m. i. _s_ ru. || tasmat striyo nirindriya adayadir\napi papat; while M. and the I. O. copy of the commentary have,\ntasmannirindriya adaya _s_ _k_ a striyo mata iti _s_ ruti _h_ [suti _h_ , M.]\nThe Telugu copy is mutilated, and reads nadayantiriti sruti _h_. Though the\nreading of the Dekhan MSS. is supported by Mitrami _s_ ra Viramitrodaya, fol.\n209, p. I, 1. 3, it is certainly not the original one, for there is no verb by\nwhich the accusative \'dayam\' is governed. Mitrami _s_ ra\'s attempt to make it\ndepend on \'arhati\' in the verse quoted in Sutra 45 is futile, because,\naccording to the usage of the Sutrakaras, a Sutra may be completed by a verb\ntaken frost another original aphorism of the author, but cannot be connecter\nwith a portion of a quotation taken from some other work. This same principle,\nof course, applies not only to Sutras, but to the writings of all other\nauthors, whether Indian or European. The reading of K., M., and of the I. O.\ncopy of the commentary is not open to the objection just mentioned, and\ntherefore preferable. But it seems to me highly probable that, nevertheless,\nit is not p. 232 quite genuine; for the word \'tasmat,\' with which it begins,\nis not required, because its sense is already expressed by the following hi,\'\nand because the Sutra apparently contains half an Anush _t_ ubh _S_ loka,\nwhich the insertion of tasmat destroys. It is also easy to see how it came to\nbe inserted. Every Ya _g_ urvedi who read the passage would be reminded of the\nanalogous passage of the Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita VI, 5, 8, 2, \'tasmat striyo\nnirindriya adayadir api papat pu _m_ sa _h_ upastitaram,\' which in K. has\nactually been inserted after our Sutra. In the Vedic Mantra \'tasmat\' is\nrequired, and is certainly the genuine reading. Hence it seems to have been\ntransferred into Baudhayana\'s text, possibly by the mistake of some scribe\nwho, according to the habit of his kind, took a marginal reference to the\nbeginning of the Vedic passage for a correction of the text. In my opinion it\nmust be thrown out. The sense of the half verse remains exactly the same. It\ncorresponds to Manu IX, 18. According to Govindasvamin and others its object\nis to show that women are incapable of inheriting, and the word daya,\n\'portion,\' must be taken in the sense of \'a share of the inheritance.\' For a\nfull discussion of this point, I refer to the Introductory Note on Book I,\nChapter II, Sect. 14 of West and Miller\'s Digest of H. L. C., third edition.\n\n[232:47](sbe1457.htm#fr_1146) Vish _n_ u XXV, 15, 17; Vasish _th_ a XXI, 14.\n\n[232:48](sbe1457.htm#fr_1147)-50.
