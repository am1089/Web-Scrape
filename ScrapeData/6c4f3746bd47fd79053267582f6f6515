RUSSELL\n\n![](img/tinit.jpg)THE brown and yellow of autumn are touching the chestnut-\nleaves again for the tenth time since those early days when we first began to\nseek the small old path the seers know.\n\nOn such a day as this, rejoicing in the sunlight, we lay on our backs in the\ngrass, and, looking up into the blue, tried to think ourselves into that sew\nworld which we had suddenly discovered ourselves to inhabit. For we had caught\nthe word, handed down with silent laughter through the ages, that we ourselves\nare the inventors of the game of life, the kings of this most excellent\nuniverse: that there is so sorrow, but fancy weaves it; that we need not even\nknock to be admitted, for we already are, and always were, though we had\nforgotten it, within the doors of life.\n\nThat young enthusiasm and hourly icy of living was one of old destiny\'s\nprecious presents, a brightness to\n\np. xviii\n\nremember when storms gathered round us, as they did many a time in the years\nwince: there was a gaiety and lightness in the air then, a delight of new\ndiscovery, that I do not think we shall find again; yet I know, and you also\nknow, what excellent strength we have gained instead. For, carrying our high\nhopes with us, all these years, as one side of life after another was turned\nto us, as we had to pass through rough ways as well as smooth, to wrestle with\nthe stubborn tendencies of things, full-breasted and strenuous, we have fought\nand worked into ourselves an intimate knowledge of what we then only divined,\nwe have realized much that then loomed dim and ghostly before us, we have\nlearned to abide confidently by spiritual law.\n\nTo gain our experience side by side would have been very pleasant, had fate so\nwilled it; but fate willed quite otherwise. Almost at the outset.; destiny\ncarried me, vagrant, to the distant rivers of the east, whose waters mirror\nold towered shrines among the palm-trees, while the boatman\'s song floats\necho-like across; or where the breakers of the lonely,\n\np. xix\n\nlimitless ocean cast forth strange shells upon the sand; or through the grey\nalder-forests stretching away desolate to the frozen seas; or again, among\nrugged mountains, shaggy with pine-forests, where rainbow-sparkles carpet the\nsnow.\n\nAnd you, whom outward fate has held stationary, travelled perhaps further\nafter all; finding your way homeward to the strange world the seers tell of,\nthe world at the back of the heavens; and sending to us your "Songs by the\nWay."\n\nIt was an ambition of mine, in those old days, to translate, from the Indian\nbooks of Wisdom, the story of the Sacrificer\'s son who was sent by his father\nto the house of Death. This story has always seemed to me a teaching of\nadmirable worth, carrying with it the most precious gift of all, a sense of\nthe high mysteriousness and vast hidden treasure of life, which makes us\nseekers for ever, always finding, yet always knowing that there is still more\nto find; so that every day becomes a thing of limitless promise and wonder,\nonly revealing itself as containing a new wonder within. For\n\np. xx\n\nwhat teaching could bring a more wonderful sense of the largeness and hidden\nriches of being than this: that our sincerest friend is the once-dreaded king\nof terrors; that death teaches us what no other can--the lesson of the full\nand present eternity of life? We need not wait till our years are closed for\nhis teaching: that wisdom of his, like every other treasure of life, is all-\npresent in every moment, in full abundance, here and now. It is the teaching\nof Death that, to gain the better, we must lose the dearer; to gain the\ngreater, we must lose the less; to win the abundant world of reality, we must\ngive up the world of fancy and folly and fear which we have so long held dear:\nwe have been learning it all these years since we began; learning also Death\'s\ngrim jest, that there is no sacrifice possible for us at all, for while we\nwere painfully renouncing the dearer, his splendid generosity had already\ngiven us the better--new worlds instead of old.\n\nWell, the ten years are passed, and my ambition is fulfilled; I hand you my\nrendering of Death\'s lesson, and\n\np. xxi\n\ntwo more teachings from the same old wise books.\n\nI have found them wise, beyond all others; and, beyond all others, filled with\nthat very light which makes all things new; the light discovered first within,\nin the secret place of the heart, and which brimming over there fills the\nwhole of life, lightening every dark and clouded way. That glowing heart\nwithin us, we are beginning to guess, is the heart of all things, the\neverlasting foundation of the world; and because speech is given therein to\nthat teaching of oneness, of our hearts and the heart eternal as eternally\none, I have translated the last of these three passages from the books of\nWisdom.\n\nYou will find in them, besides high intuition, a quaint and delightful\nflavour, a charm of childlike simplicity; yet of a child who is older than all\nage, a child of the eternal and infinite, whose simplicity is better than the\nwisdom of the wise.\n\nThere is no answer in words to the question: What is in the great Beyond? nor\ncan there be; yet I think we know already that, in the\n\np. xxii\n\nnameless mystery of the real, it will be altogether well with us--now and\nafter. This strong reconciliation with the real is, very likely, the best\nfruit of our ten years\' learning.\n\nCHARLES JOHNSTON.\n\n_Ballykilbeg_ ,  \n October 15, 1895.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I.
