Janamejaya asked :-- O grandfather! What bad act did that child commit,\nthat no sooner he was born than he was killed by Kamsa?\n\n\n\np. 334\n\n\n\n2\\. Especially, Mahar _s_ i Narada is the the best amongst the Munis and\nforemost amongst the Brahma-vids (Knowers of Brahma), always doing virtuous\nacts, and learned; why did he become the agent in this very sinful act?\n\n\n\n3\\. Pundits declare that the doers and stimulators of any evil deed both are\nequally responsible; then how is it that Narada, being the best of the Munis,\ninstigated the wicked Kamsa to do this evil act!\n\n\n\n4\\. I am very much in doubt on this point. Kindly describe, in detail, the act\nthat the child did as the result of which be had to meet with this fate of\nbeing killed.\n\n\n\n5\\. Vyasa said :-- The Devar _s_ i Narada is always fond of seeing quarrels\nbrought about amongst parties; he always likes thus to see the fun. Here\nspecially to serve the gods\xc2\x92 purpose he went to Kamsa and incited him to such\nan act.\n\n\n\n6\\. Really he never intends to speak a lie; he is always truth speaking; pure\nhearted, and always ready to serve the gods.\n\n\n\n7\\. Thus the six sons were born to Devaki; and Kamsa, too, killed those six\nsons consecutively as they were born. These six sons named _S_ a _d_ garbha,\nwere killed just after their births, owing to their having been previously\ncursed.\n\n\n\n8\\. O King! Hear why they were cursed before. In the reign of Svayambhuva\nManu, were born to Ur _n_ a; the wife of Mahar _s_ i Marichi, the six powerful\nsons, all of a virtuous disposition.\n\n\n\n9-11. Once, on an occasion, the Prajapati Brahma, on seeing his daughter,\nbecame passionate, and was ready to hold sexual intercourse with her. At this,\nthose six sons laughed at him. Brahma cursed them saying \xc2\x93You all go quickly\nand take your birth in the wombs of the asuras.\xc2\x94 Therefore those six sons\nbecame the sons of Kalanemi in their first birth. At their second birth, they\nbecame the sons of Hira _n_ yakas\xc2\x92ipu. This second time they had the fear of\ncurse in their minds and therefore were born endowed with knowledge.\n\n\n\n12\\. In this birth they became peaceful and, collecting all their energies,\nthey began to practise austerities. Brahma was pleased at this and asked the\n_S_ a _d_ garbha to take boons.\n\n\n\n13\\. Brahma said :-- O my sons! I was very angry to you before and cursed you;\nnow I am very much pleased with you; ask boons from me that you all desire.\n\n\n\n14-15. Vyasa said :-- Hearing Brahma\xc2\x92s words, they were very glad and becoming\nvery anxious to secure their objects of desire, said :-- O our grand\n\n\n\np. 335\n\n\n\nsire! Today thou art pleased unto us; now favour us with our desired boons.\nThat we may be invulnerable to all the Devas, human beings, the big serpents\nthe Gandarbhas, and the Lord of Siddhas, (semi-divine beings supposed to be of\ngreat purity and holiness and said to be particularly characterised by eight\nsupernatural faculties called Siddhis).\n\n\n\n16\\. Vyasa said :-- Brahma told them \xc2\x93What you have asked, you would certainly\nget; O blessed ones! better go now; my words will be found to be literally\ntrue. No doubt in this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n17-19. Granting them boons, Brahma went away; they then became very glad. O\nbest of Kurus! Hira _n_ yakas\xc2\x92ipu began to think \xc2\x93My sons now have pleased the\nGrandsire Brahma and are now regardless of me\xc2\x94 and got very angry and said :--\nYou all are become very proud on account of receiving boons; and since you\nhave ceased your good feelings towards me I also henceforth cut off my\nconnection with you. Now better go to Patala; you will be known in this world\nas _S_ a _d_ garbha.\n\n\n\n20-21. At present you would be always involved in deep sleep and remain in\nPatala for many years; and when you will be born one after another in the womb\nof Devaki, then your father Kalanemi of previous birth will be born as Kamsa;\nand he would be cruel hearted and surely kill you all, no sooner you be born.\n\n\n\n22\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus because they were cursed, they took their births\nrepeatedly and Kamsa, too, being urged on by the same curse, killed those sons\nof Devaki, the _S_ a _d_ garbha, no sooner they were born.\n\n\n\n23-24. In the seventh womb of Devaki, Ananta made his appearance. The foetus\nin the womb was attracted by Yoga maya and placed in the womb of Rohi _n_ i.\nBut there was the rumour that there was miscarriage in the womb of Devaki in\nthe fifth month; and this became known to the public.\n\n\n\n25\\. Kamsa came to know that there had been miscarriage. That wicked soul\nbecame exceedingly glad to hear this gladdening news.\n\n\n\n26\\. And at about this time the Bhagavan, the Protector of the devotee\nappeared in the eighth womb of Devaki to serve the purpose of the gods and to\nrelieve the load of the Earth.\n\n\n\n27-28. The King said :-- O best of Munis! \xc2\x93You have described the part\nincarnations of (1) Kas\xc2\x92yapa as Vasudeva and (2) of Bhagavan Hari to relieve\nthe burden of the Goddess Earth as prayed by Her; and (3) of Ananta Deva; but\nyou have not described the part incarnations of the other Devas. How the other\nDevas incarnated as their parts on this earth, kindly describe them now.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 336\n\n\n\n29\\. Vyasa said :-- The part incarnations of Suras and Asuras on this earth,\nand their names I am now saying to you in brief; hear.\n\n\n\n30-32. Vasudeva was the part incarnation of Kas\xc2\x92yapa, Devaki was of Aditi,\nBaladeva, of Ananta; Vasudeva S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, of S\xc2\x92riman Naraya _n_ a; the\nson of Dharma existing even at that time in his physical body; Arju _n_ a, of\nNara, the younger brother of Naraya _n_ a.\n\n\n\n33\\. Yuidhi _st_ hira was part incarnate of Dharma, Bhimasena, of Vayu, the\npowerful twins of Madri, Nakul and Sahadeva, of As\xc2\x92vini-kumaras?\n\n\n\n34\\. The valiant hero Kar _n_ a, born of Kunti, was part incarnate of the Sun,\nand the high minded Vidura, the knower of the Supreme Essence, was incarnate\nof Yama, the king Dharmaraj. Dro _n_ a, the \xc3\x82charya of the Kurus and the Pa\n_nd_ avas was the part incarnate of Brihaspati; and his son As\xc2\x92vatthama was\npart incarnate of Rudra Deva.\n\n\n\n35\\. S\xc2\x92antanu was the part incarnate of the Ocean; his wife, of the river\nGanges in human farm. It is stated in the Pura _n_ as that the king Devaka was\npart incarnate of the Lord of Gandarvas.\n\n\n\n36-41. The Grand-father of the Kauravas, the foremost of the heroes, Bhi _s_\nma Deva was the incarnate of Vasu; Vira _t_ a, the Lord of Matsya was the part\nincarnate of Maruts; Dhritara _st_ ra, of the Daitya Hamsa, the son of Ari\n_st_ a Nemi; Kripa and Krita Varma, of Maruts; Duryodhana, of Kali and\nS\xc2\x92akuni, of Dvapara; Suvarchakhya Somapraru, of the son of the Moon; Dhri _st_\nadyumna was part incarnate of Fire and S\xc2\x92ikha _nd_ i of Raksasa; Pradyumna was\npart incarnate of Sanatkumara; the king Drupada was part incarnate of Varu _n_\na; Draupadi, of Lak _s_ mi; Draupadi\xc2\x92s five sons, of Visve-devas; Kunti was\nincarnate of Siddhi; Madri, of Dhriti; Gandhari, of Mati; the wives of S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a were the heavenly public women; thus all the Devas came as their\npart incarnations, urged on by Indra.\n\n\n\n42-43. Amongst the Asuras, S\xc2\x92is\xc2\x92upala was the incarnate of Hira _n_ yakas\xc2\x92ipu;\nJarasandha, of Biprachitti, S\xc2\x92alya, of Prahlada; Kamsa, of Kalanemi and Kes\xc2\x92i,\nof Haya S\xc2\x92ira. The Asura named Ari _st_ a of the form of a cow that was killed\nby Kri _sn_ a was the son of Bali.\n\n\n\n44\\. Dhri _st_ aketu was part incarnate of Anuhradha, Bhagadatta, of Vaskala;\nPralamba, of Lamba; Dhenuka, of Khara.\n\n\n\n45\\. Cha _n_ ura and Mus\xc2\x92 _t_ ika, the two athletes, were part incarnates of\nVaraha, and Kis\xc2\x92ora, the two dreadful Daityas.\n\n\n\n46-47. Kubalaya, the elephant of Kamsa, was part incarnate of Ari _st_ a, the\nsun of Diti. Vaki was the daughter of Bali, Vaka was her younger.\n\n\n\np. 337\n\n\n\nThe powerful son of Dro _n_ a, As\xc2\x92vatthama, though known as the part incarnate\nof Rudra, was really born of the four parts of Yama, Rudra, Cupidity and\nAnger.\n\n\n\n48-49. The Daityas and Raksasas that were born to relieve the heavy burden of\nthe Earth were all incarnates of Asuras. O king! I have thus narrated to you\nin order the incarnations of the Suras and Asuras, as they are stated duly in\nthe Pura _n_ as.\n\n\n\n50-51. When Brahma and the other Devas went to Vi _sn_ u and prayed to Him\nthen Hari gave to Brahma one hair of a black colour and one hair of a white\ncolour. The Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a was born of that black hair and S\xc2\x92a _n_\nkar _s_ a _n_ a Baladeva was born of the white hair. They were both the\nincarnations of Vi _sn_ u.\n\n\n\nNote here the black is the younger and the stronger; and they also represent\nthe polarities. The Jivas are points of those hairs.\n\n\n\n52\\. He who hears with devotion the story of these part incarnations becomes\nfreed of all sins and passes away his time merrily, surrounded by his circle\nof friends; there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\nThus ends the 22nd chapter in 4th book of S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam the Maha\nPura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa on the part\nincarnations of the several Devas.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 23](bk04ch23.htm)\n\n'
