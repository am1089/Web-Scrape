That Ukthya (graha), forsooth, is his undefined breath (vital air)\n2, and as such it is that self of his; for the undefined breath is the self;\nit is his\n\np. 293\n\nvital energy. Hence he draws it by means of this (earth), because of her is\nthe bowl, and he draws it with a bowl;--for undecaying and immortal is this\n(earth), and undecaying and immortal is the vital energy; therefore he draws\nit by means of this (earth or bowl).\n\n4:2:3:22\\. He draws it full; for full means all, and the vital energy means\nall: therefore he draws it full.\n\n4:2:3:33\\. That Dhruva (graha) 1, forsooth, (also) is his vital energy; by it\nhis body is held together, and the joints are knit together. For (when) the\nlast cup has not yet been drawn from that (Soma juice in the Ukthya vessel)\nfor the A _kh_ avaka priest,\n\n4:2:3:44\\. Then he takes the king (Soma) down (from the cart) 2, and pours one\nthird of the Vasativaris (into the \xc3\x82dhavaniya trough). Thus the joint unites;\nfor, indeed, he makes (the Ukthya cup) the first of the second pressing (Soma\nfeast), and the last of the first: that which belongs to the second pressing\nhe makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last. Thus he\ninterlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this one overlapping\nthus, and this one thus.\n\n4:2:3:55\\. In like manner at the midday pressing: (when)\n\np. 294\n\nthe last cup has not yet been drawn therefrom for the A _kh_ avaka priest, he\npours (the remaining) one-third of the Vasativari (into the \xc3\x82dhavaniya). Thus\nthe joint unites; for, indeed, he makes it the first of the second pressing,\nand the last of the first pressing 1: that which belongs to the second\npressing he makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last.\nThus he interlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this one\noverlapping thus, and this one thus. And because his body is thereby held\ntogether, therefore this (graha) is his vital energy.\n\n4:2:3:66\\. This (Ukthya graha) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion.\nAt the morning feast he (the Adhvaryu) divides it for three songs of praise 2,\nand at the midday feast for three,--this makes six times, for there are six\nseasons, and the seasons mature all wishes here on earth: for this reason,\nthen, this (libation) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion.\n\n4:2:3:77\\. He draws it without (reciting) a puroru _k_ ; for the puroru _k_ is\na song of praise, since the puroru _k_ is a _Ri_ _k_ , and the song of praise\nis _Ri_ _k_ ; and the libation is Saman; and what other (formula) he mutters,\nthat is Ya _g_ us. Formerly these same (puroru _k_ verses) were apart 3 from\nthe _Ri_ _k_ s, apart from the Ya _g_ us, and apart from the Samans.\n\np. 295\n\n4:2:3:88\\. The gods said, 'Come, let us place them among the Ya _g_ us: thus\nthis science will be still more manifold.' Accordingly they placed them among\nthe Ya _g_ us, and thenceforward this science was still more manifold.\n\n4:2:3:99\\. And the reason why he draws this (graha) without a puroru _k_ , is\nthat the puroru _k_ is praise, (being) a _Ri_ _k_ , and the song of praise is\n_Ri_ _k_ ; and in that he divides it for recitations, thereby indeed it\nbecomes possessed of a puroru _k_ : hence he draws it without a puroru _k_.\n\n4:2:3:1010\\. Now he draws it from that (stream of Soma 1), with (Va _g_. S.\nVII, 22), 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Indra, possessed of the\ngreat (chant), possessed of vigour,'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice;\nwherefore he says 'thee for Indra;' and by 'possessed of the great (chant),\npossessed of vigour,' he means to say 'for him, the strong;'--'I take (thee)\nthe song-pleasing,' for he indeed takes it for songs of praise;--'what great\nvigour is thine, O Indra'--whereby he means to say, 'what strength is thine, O\nIndra'--'for that (I take) thee! for Vish _n_ u--thee!' for he takes it for\nthe life of the sacrifice: hence he says, 'for that--thee! for Vish _n_ u--\nthee!' With, 'This is thy womb: thee for the songs of praise!' he deposits it;\nfor he indeed takes it for songs of praise.\n\n4:2:3:1111\\. He distributes it 2 with, 'Thee, the\n\np. 296\n\ngod-pleasing 1, I take for the gods, for the life of the sacrifice.' He who\nwould perform it in this manner would assume the command 2; but let him rather\ndistribute it to the respective deities.\n\n4:2:3:1212\\. With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Mitra and Varu _n_ a,\nfor the life of the sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the Maitravaru _n_\na priest;--for in verses to Mitra and Varu _n_ a they (the Udgat _ri_ s) chant\npraises for this (libation); and he (the Hot _ri_ ) afterwards recites verses\nto Mitra and Varu _n_ a for the _s_ astra, and offers with a verse to Mitra\nand Varu _n_ a.\n\n4:2:3:1313\\. With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Indra, for the life of\nthe sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin;\nfor in verses to Indra praises are chanted for this (libation); and verses to\nIndra are afterwards recited as a _s_ astra, and offering is made with a verse\nto Indra.\n\n4:2:3:1414\\. With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Indra and Agni, for the\nlife of the sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the A _kh_ avaka; for in\nverses to Indra and Agni praises are chanted for this (libation); and verses\nto Indra and Agni are afterwards recited as a _s_ astra, and offering is made\n\np. 297\n\nwith a verse to Indra and Agni. With, 'Thee . . . . for Indra,' he performs at\nthe midday feast, for the midday feast is sacred to Indra.\n\n4:2:3:1515\\. Now the _K_ arakadhvaryus 1 divide (the Ukthya libation into\nthree portions), with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing,\nI take for the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises, agreeable to\nMitra and Varu _n_ a!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee to Mitra and Varu _n_ a!'\nhe (the _K_ arakadhvaryu) deposits it; and with 'Thou art a re-offering' he\ntouches the sthali.\n\n4:2:3:1616\\. 'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing. I take\nfor the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises,--agreeable to Indra!--\nThis is thy womb: thee to Indra!' thus he deposits it; and with 'Thou art a\nre-offering' he touches the sthali.\n\n4:2:3:1717\\. 'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing, I take\nfor the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises,--agreeable to Indra and\nAgni!--This is thy womb: thee for Indra and Agni!' thus he deposits it. He\ndoes not at this (third portion) touch the sthali with 'Thou art a re-\noffering.' '. . . . Thee for Indra!' he says each time at the midday feast,\nfor the midday feast is sacred to Indra.\n\nTwice he touches the sthali with 'Thou art a re-offering;' and silently he\nputs it down the third time.\n\n4:2:3:1818\\. But, in order to avoid sameness (of performance), let him not\ntake it out with the 'support;' nor let him deposit it in the 'womb;' for this\n(Ukthya\n\np. 298\n\nlibation) has at first been taken with the 'support,' and it has at first been\ndeposited in the womb;--and were he now also to take it with the 'support,'\nand deposit it in the 'womb,' he would assuredly commit (the fault of)\nsameness. And as to his touching the sthali with 'Thou art a re-offering,' he\nwill indeed again take a libation therefrom. Let him not heed this, but let\nhim put down (the vessel) silently.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[292:2](sbe2647.htm#fr_706) We ought doubtless, with the Ka _n_ va text, to\nread 'pra _n_ a _h_ ' instead of 'atma.'\n\n[293:1](sbe2647.htm#fr_707) See IV, 2, 4, 1 seq.\n\n[293:2](sbe2647.htm#fr_708) At the end of the morning feast the Soma in the\nUkthya bowl (sthali) is poured into the Ukthya cup (patra) in three portions;\nand part of each having been offered, the remaining juice is drunk by the Hot\n_ri_ 's assistants, viz. the Pra _s_ ast _ri_ , Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin,\nand A _kh_ avaka. Each of these potations is preceded by the chanting of an a\n_g_ ya-stotra, and the recitation of the a _g_ ya- _s_ astra (see next page,\nnote 2). But before the portion of the last-named priest is poured into his\ncup ( _k_ amasa), fresh Soma-plants are taken down from the cart for the\nmidday pressing; one half of the remaining Vasativari water (or one third of\nthe original quantity) being also poured into the \xc3\x82dhavaniya trough. See [III,\n9, 2, 3](sbe2637.htm#3:9:2:3).\n\n[294:1](sbe2647.htm#fr_709) That is to say, the last (thing) of the first of\nthe last two pressings, or of the midday pressing.\n\n[294:2](sbe2647.htm#fr_710) Uktha, lit. 'recitation,' is the old term for\n'sastra' ([IV, 3, 2, 1](sbe2651.htm#4:3:2:1) seq.). Regarding the three _s_\nastras of the Hotrakas, for the recitation of which the Ukthya graha is\ndivided between those priests, see notes on [IV, 3, 1,\n25](sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:25); [3, 3, 19](sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:19).\n\n[294:3](sbe2647.htm#fr_711) The Ka _n_ va text reads thrice 'abhyardhe.'\nRegarding the puroru _k_ formulas see [p. 268](sbe2642.htm#page_268), note\n[1](sbe2642.htm#fn_643).\n\n[295:1](sbe2647.htm#fr_712) See [p. 256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note\n[1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619).\n\n[295:2](sbe2647.htm#fr_713) That is, he pours, for each of the three assistant\npriests, his respective portion into the Ukthya-patra. This distribution does\nnot however take place till the end of the morning performance; see note to\n[IV, 2, 2, 4](sbe2646.htm#4:2:2:4); [3, 1, 25](sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:25).\n\n[296:1](sbe2647.htm#fr_714) Or, the god-prospering (i.e. the one prospering\nthe gods), devavi.\n\n[296:2](sbe2647.htm#fr_715) Pra _s_ asana _m_ kuryat. The same phrase occurs\nI, 9, I, 24, where I translated 'will ensure dominion,'--probably wrongly,\nthough I am by no means sure of the correct meaning. Saya _n_ a there seems to\ntake it in the sense of 'he bids (the gods grant his request), thus having\nchiefly his own interest in view'--'pra _s_ asyante 'to deva _h_ prarthyamana\niti pra _s_ asanam parusha _m_ syat sakshat svarthaparatva _m_ kuryad ity\nartha _h_.' The Ka _n_ va text reads, 'let him not divide (the libation) with\nthis (formula), for he who divides it thus--pra _s_ asana _m_ kuryat.' Perhaps\nhe means to say, that by using that formula one would put oneself above the\ngods. At I, 9, 1, 14 'one would give orders (to the gods)' is probably the\nright translation.\n\n[297:1](sbe2647.htm#fr_716) Such is the rule (sthiti); but the Karakadhvaryus\ndivide it in this way.' Ka _n_ va text. The formulas of the Taitt. S. I, 4,\n12, and Maitray. S. I, 3, 14, differ from the above; perhaps the Ka _th_ aka\nis referred to; see v. Schroeder, M. S. I, p. 36, note 3.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe2648.htm)\n\n"
