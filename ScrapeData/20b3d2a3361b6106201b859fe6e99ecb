'Entire interruption' means, according to\nthe commentators, that not only the study of the Veda itself, but also that of\nthe Veda\xe1\xb9\x85gas, or even all sorts of worldly instruction are forbidden.\n\n[323:3](sbe29184.htm#fr_829) I have left the words sarvarupe _k_ a\nuntranslated. Evidently p. 324 sarvarupa is identical with the doubtful word\n_s_ avarupa which twice occurs in the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya. See the\ndiscussion on that word in the note on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 12, 10.\n\n[324:4](sbe29184.htm#fr_830) On antardivakirtye, comp. Manu V, 85. Gautama\nXVI, 19.\n\n[324:8](sbe29184.htm#fr_831) The Tanunaptra is an invocation directed to\nTanunapt _ri_ (i.e. the wind) by which the officiating priests and the Ya _g_\namana at a Soma sacrifice pledge their faith to do no harm to each other. See\nIndische Studien, X, 362.\n\n[325:12](sbe29184.htm#fr_832) The reading of the Mantra is doubtful. I think\nit should stand as Professor Stenzler has printed it, except that I should\npropose to correct yuva into yuvana (comp. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana- _S_ rauta VI, 12,\n12). It is probable that the gods addressed are the two A _s_ vins, who are\ncalled kavi and yuvana in several passages of the Vedas.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 12](sbe29185.htm)\n\n"
