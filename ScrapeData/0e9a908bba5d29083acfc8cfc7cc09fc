'A cloth, an upper cloth, and gold,' this is what they spread out\nfor the horse 1: thereon they 'quiet' (slaughter) it. When the victims have\nbeen 'quieted,' the (king's) wives come up with water for washing the feet,--\nfour wives; and a young maiden as the fifth, and four hundred female\nattendants.\n\n13:5:2:22\\. When the foot-water is ready, they cause the Mahishi to lie down\nnear the horse, and cover her up with the upper cloth, with 'In heaven ye\nenvelop yourselves,'--for that indeed is heaven where they immolate the\nvictim, . . ., 'May the vigorous male, the layer of seed, lay seed!' she says\n2 for the completeness of union.\n\n13:5:2:33\\. Whilst they are lying there, the Sacrificer addresses the horse\n(Va _g_. S. XXIII, 21), 'Utsakhya ava guda _m_ dhehi!' No one replies to him,\nlest there should be some one to rival the Sacrificer.\n\n13:5:2:44\\. The Adhvaryu then addresses the maiden, 'Hey hey maiden, that\nlittle bird . . .'--The maiden replies to him, 'Adhvaryu! that little bird . .\n.'\n\n13:5:2:55\\. And the Brahman addresses the Mahishi, 'Mahishi, hey hey Mahishi,\nthy mother and father mount to the top of the tree . . .'--She has a hundred\ndaughters of kings attending upon her: these\n\np. 387\n\nreply to the Brahman, 'Brahman, hey hey Brahman, thy mother and father play on\nthe top of the tree. . .'\n\n13:5:2:66\\. And the Udgat _ri_ addresses the favourite, 'Vavata, hey hey\nVavata, turn upwards!' She has a hundred noble-women (ra _g_ anya) attending\nupon her: these reply to the Udgat _ri_ , 'Hey hey Udgat _ri_ , turn upwards!'\n\n13:5:2:77\\. And the Hot _ri_ says to the discarded wife, 'Pariv _ri_ kta, hey\nhey Pariv _ri_ kta, when large meets small in this a _m_ hubhedi . . .'--She\nhas a hundred daughters of heralds and head-men of villages attending upon\nher: these reply to the Hot _ri_ , 'Hot _ri_ , hey hey Hot _ri_ , when the\ngods favoured the lalamagu . . .'\n\n13:5:2:88\\. Then the chamberlain addresses the fourth wife, 'Palagali, hey hey\nPalagali, when the deer eats the corn, one thinks not of the fat cattle . . .'\n--She has a hundred daughters of chamberlains and charioteers attending upon\nher: these reply to the chamberlain, 'Chamberlain, hey hey chamberlain, when\nthe deer eats the corn, one thinks not of the fat cattle. . .'\n\n13:5:2:99\\. These speeches, the derisive discourses, indeed are every kind of\nattainment, and in the A _s_ vamedha all objects of desire are contained: 'By\nevery kind of speech may we obtain all objects of our desire' thus thinking,\nthey cause the Mahishi to rise, Those (women) then walk back in the same way\nas they had come; and the others finally utter the verse containing (the word)\n'fragrant' ( _Ri_ g-v. IV, 39, 6), 'To Dadhikravan have I sung praises. . .'\n\n13:5:2:1010\\. For, indeed, life and the deities depart from those who at the\nsacrifice speak impure speech: it is their speech they thereby purify so that\nthe deities may not depart from the divine service.\n\np. 388\n\n[paragraph continues] Now (some) put the omentum of the Gom _ri_ ga and that\nof the hornless he-goat upon the horse and then take it (to the \xc3\x82havaniya),\nsaying, 'The horse has no omentum.' Let him not do so: of the horse he should\ncertainly take the fat; the (omenta of the) others are normal.\n\n13:5:2:1111\\. When the omenta have been roasted, and when they have performed\n(the oblations) with the Svahas 1, and returned to the back (of the\nsacrificial ground), they hold a Brahmodya 2 (theological discussion) in the\nSadas. Having entered by the front door, they sit down at their several\nhearths.\n\n13:5:2:1212\\. The Hot _ri_ asks the Adhvaryu (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 45), 'Who is\nit that walketh singly 3?. . .' He replies to him (ib. 46), 'Surya (the sun)\nwalketh singly. . .'\n\n13:5:2:1313\\. The Adhvaryu then asks the Hot _ri_ (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 47),\n'Whose light is there equal to the sun?. . .' He replies to him (ib. 48), 'The\nBrahman (n.) is the light equal to the sun. . .'\n\n13:5:2:1414\\. The Brahman then asks the Udgat _ri_ (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 49), 'I\nask thee for the sake of knowledge, O friend of the gods [if thou hast applied\nthy mind thereto: hath Vish _n_ u entered the whole world at those three\nplaces at which offering is made unto him?]' and he replies (ib. 50), 'I too\nam at those three places [at which he entered the whole world:\n\np. 389\n\ndaily do I, with the one body 1, go round the earth, the sky, and the back of\nyonder sky].'\n\n13:5:2:1515\\. The Udgat _ri_ then asks the Brahman (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 51),\n'Into what (things) hath the Spirit 2 entered, [and what (things) are\nestablished in the spirit? this, O Brahman, we crave of thee: what answer dost\nthou give unto us thereon?]' and he replies (ib. 52), 'Into five (things) hath\nthe spirit entered, and they are established in the spirit: this I reply unto\nthee thereon; not superior in wisdom art thou (to me).'\n\n13:5:2:1616\\. When this (verse) has been uttered, they rise and betake\nthemselves from the Sadas eastwards to the Sacrificer. Haying come to him,\nseated in front of the Havirdhana 3 (shed), they sit down in their several\nplaces.\n\n13:5:2:1717\\. The Hot _ri_ then asks the Adhvaryu (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 53),\n'What was the first conception 4?. . .' and he replies (ib. 54), 'The sky was\nthe first conception. . .'\n\n13:5:2:1818\\. The Adhvaryu then asks the Hot _ri_ (ib. 55), 'Who, pray, is the\ntawny one (pi _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85gila)? [who is the kurupi _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85gila? who moveth in leaps?\nwho creepeth along the path?]' and he replies (ib. 56), 'The tawny one is the\nuncreated (night) 5; [the kurupi _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85gila is the porcupine; the hare\n\np. 390\n\nmoveth in leaps; the snake creepeth along the path].'\n\n13:5:2:1919\\. The Brahman then asks the Udgat _ri_ (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 57),\n'How many kinds are thereof this (sacrifice), how many syllables?--[how many\noblations? how often is (the fire) enkindled? The ordinances of sacrifice have\nI now asked of thee: how many priests offer in due form?]' and he replies (ib.\n58), 'Six kinds there are of this (sacrifice), a hundred syllables, [eighty\noblations, and three kindling-sticks; the ordinances of sacrifice do I declare\nunto thee: seven priests offer in due form].'\n\n13:5:2:2020\\. The Udgat _ri_ then asks the Brahman (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 59),\n'Who knoweth the navel of this world? [who heaven and earth and the air? who\nknoweth the birth-place of the great Sun? who knoweth the Moon, whence it was\nborn?]' and he replies (ib. 60), 'I know the navel of this world, [I know\nheaven and earth and the air; I know the birth-place of the great Sun, and I\nknow the Moon, whence it was born]'\n\n13:5:2:2121\\. The Sacrificer then asks the Adhvaryu (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 61), 'I\nask thee about the farthest end of the earth, [I ask where is the navel of the\nworld; I ask thee about the seed of the vigorous steed; I ask thee about the\nhighest seat of speech];' and he replies (ib. 62), 'This altar-ground is the\nfarthest end of the earth; [this sacrifice is the navel of the world; this\nSoma-juice is the seed of the vigorous\n\np. 391\n\nsteed; this Brahman (priest) is the highest seat of speech].'\n\n13:5:2:2222\\. Verily, this is the complete attainment of speech, to wit the\nBrahmodya, and in the A _s_ vamedha all desires are contained: 'By means of\nall speech may we obtain all our desires!' so (they think).\n\n13:5:2:2323\\. When the colloquy has been held, the Adhvaryu enters the\n(Havirdhana), and draws Pra _g_ apati's (first) Mahiman cup (of Soma) in a\ngold vessel. The Puroru _k_ formula 1 thereof is (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 1; Rig-v.\nX, 121, 1), 'The golden germ was first produced . . .' And its Puro\xe0\xa4\xbdnuvakya is\n(Va _g_. S. XXIII, 63), 'Of good nature, self-existent at first (within the\ngreat ocean: I verily place the right germ whence is born Pra _g_\napati).'--'May the Hot _ri_ offer to Pra _g_ apati: [of the Mahiman Soma\n(cup); may he relish, may he drink the Soma! Hot _ri_ , utter the offering-\nformula!]' is the Praisha (ib. 64). The Hot _ri_ utters the offering-formula\n(ib. 65), 'O Pra _g_ apati, none other than thee hath encompassed all these\nforms 2 . . . ;' and as the Vasha _t_ is pronounced, he (the Adhvaryu) offers\nwith (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 2), 'What greatness of thine there hath been in the\nday, and the year, [what greatness of thine there hath been in the wind and\nthe air; what greatness of thine there hath been in the heavens and the sun,\nto that greatness of thine, to Pra _g_ apati, hail, to the gods 3!]' He does\nnot repeat the Vasha _t_ , for he offers the cup of Soma all at once.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[386:1](sbe44107.htm#fr_1011) See [XIII, 2, 8, 1](sbe44090.htm#13:2:8:1).\n\n[386:2](sbe44107.htm#fr_1012) Nirayatya _s_ vasya _s_ i _s_ na _m_ mahishy\nupasthe nidhatte 'v _ri_ sha va _g_ i retodha reto dadhatv' iti mithunasyaiva\nsarvatvaya.\n\n[388:1](sbe44107.htm#fr_1013) See III, 8, 2, 21-23.\n\n[388:2](sbe44107.htm#fr_1014) For a similar discussion between the Brahman and\nHot _ri_ , prior to the binding of the victims to the stakes, see [XIII, 2, 6,\n9](sbe44088.htm#13:2:6:9) seqq.\n\n[388:3](sbe44107.htm#fr_1015) For the complete verse, comprising four\nquestions, see [XIII, 2, 6,\n10](sbe44088.htm#13:2:6:10)-[13](sbe44088.htm#13:2:6:13); the answers being\ngiven there in the form of explanations.\n\n[389:1](sbe44107.htm#fr_1016) Or, with the one limb (ekena\xe1\xb9\x85gena) which\nMahidhara takes to mean 'with the mind, in mind.'
