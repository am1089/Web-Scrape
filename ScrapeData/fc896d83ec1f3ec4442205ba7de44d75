Now, then, as to the taking down of the ashes (to the water 1).\nNow, the gods at that time threw out the ashes (from the pan). They said, 'If\nwe make this, such as it is, part of our own self, we shall become mortal\ncarcases, not freed from sin; and if we cast it away, we shall put outside of\nAgni what therein is of Agni's nature: find ye out in what manner we shall do\nthis!'--They said, 'Meditate ye ( _k_ it)!' whereby, indeed, they said, 'Seek\nye a layer (or altar, _k_ iti). Seek ye in what manner we shall do this!'\n\n6:8:2:22\\. While meditating, they saw this,--'Let us take it down to the\nwater; for the water is the foundation of this universe: having settled it on\nthat wherein is the foundation of this universe, we shall reproduce from out\nof the water what there is of Agni's nature in this (heap of ashes).' They\nthen took it down to (and threw it into) the water; and in like manner does\nthis (Sacrificer) now take it down to the water.\n\n6:8:2:33\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 35] 'O divine waters, receive ye these ashes, and\nput them in a soft and fragrant place!'--that, being consumed (matter), has\nrun its course (is useless): regarding that he says, 'Put it in, the most\nfragrant place!'--'May\n\np. 294\n\nthe wives, wedded to a good lord, bow down to him,'--the wives, doubtless, are\nthe waters, for from the waters this universe is produced; and in Agni the\nwaters have indeed a good lord;--'bear it on the waters, even as a mother\n(bears) her son!'--that is, 'as a mother would bear her son on her lap, so\nbear ye this!'\n\n6:8:2:44\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 36; _Ri_ k S. VIII, 43, 9] 'In the waters, O Agni,\nis thy seat,'--that is, 'in the waters, O Agni, is thy womb; as such thou\nclingest to the plants,'--for he does indeed cling to (love) the\nplants,--'being in (their) womb thou art born again,'--when he is in the womb\nhe is indeed born again,--[Va _g_. S. XII, 37] 'Thou art the child of the\nherbs, the child of the trees, the child of all that is, O Agni, thou art the\nchild of the waters;'--he thus makes him (Agni) the child of this entire\n(universe).\n\n6:8:2:55\\. With three (verses) he throws (the ashes into the water),--\nthreefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much\nhe thus throws them down. First with one (prayer), and then with two; or first\nwith two, and then with one,--but at two separate times he throws them down:\nhe thus throws them down by means of the two-footed animals.\n\n6:8:2:66\\. He then takes some (of the ashes) therefrom: he thereby reproduces\nfrom the waters what there is of Agni's nature in that (heap of ashes). [He\ntakes it] with that (nameless or little finger), for with that (finger)\nmedicine is prepared: it is with that one he thus puts him (Agni) together.\n[Va _g_. S. XII, 38-41] 'Having settled 1 in the womb, as\n\np. 295\n\nashes, in the waters, and the earth, O Agni,'--by his ashes he is, indeed,\nsettled in the womb, that is, both in the waters and in the earth;--'having\nunited with the mothers, thou hast again, brightly shining, seated thee;'--\nthat is, 'Having joined thy mothers, thou, the shining one, hast again seated\nthyself (in thy home).'--'Having again seated thee in thy seat, the waters and\nthe earth, O Agni, thou liest in her (the earth, or pan) most happy, as in a\nmother's lap.'--'Return again with sustenance, again, O Agni, with food and\nlife; guard us again from trouble!--With wealth return, O Agni, overflow with\nthe all-feeding stream on every side!'--that is, 'With all this return thou to\nme!'\n\n6:8:2:77\\. With four (verses) he takes (some of the ashes);--he thereby\nsupplies him (Agni) with four-footed animals; and animals being food, it is\nwith food he thus supplies him. With three (verses) he takes (the ashes) down\n(to the water),--that makes seven, for of seven layers consists the fire-altar\n1, seven seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as\ngreat as is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n6:8:2:88\\. Having taken some of the ashes, and returned, he throws it into the\nfire-pan, and stands by (the fire) worshipping it; for when he throws Agni\ninto the water he does what is improper; he now makes amends to him so that he\nmay not injure him. With two (verses) relating to Agni (he worships),--for it\nis to Agni that he makes amends,--and with such\n\np. 296\n\nas contain (the verb) 'budh' (to attend to, awake), in order that Agni may\nattend to this speech of his.\n\n6:8:2:99\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 42-3; _Ri_ k S. I, 147, 2; II, 6, 4] 'Attend thou\nto this word of mine, O youngest!'--that is, 'attend to this word of mine, O\nyoungest!'--'put forth most plentifully, O faithful one!'--that is, 'put forth\nmost abundantly, O faithful one!'--'this one revileth thee, and that one\nsingeth thy praises,'--that is, 'one (man) reviles thee, and another sings thy\npraises;'--'reverently I revere thy body, O Agni!'--that is, 'I, thy reverer,\nrevere thy body, O Agni!'--'Be thou a munificent patron of offerings, O lord\nof wealth, the bestower of wealth, keep off from us the haters!' this he says\nin order that he may keep off haters from him. With two (verses) he worships\nthe fire, a Gayatri and a Trish _t_ ubh verse: the significance of this has\nbeen explained.\n\n6:8:2:1010\\. These make nine (verses),--there are nine regions 1, and Agni is\nthe regions; nine vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is,\nas great as is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n6:8:2:1111\\. He then performs two expiations; for it is for (the obtainment\nof) all his desires that he sets up that (fire);--thus whatever part of his\ndesires is here cut off when the fire is thrown into the water, that he\nthereby joins together and restores. He performs both expiations which (are\nperformed) when the fire has gone out 2: the significance of this has been\nexplained.\n\np. 297\n\n6:8:2:1212\\. This makes ten (performances),--the Vira _g_ consists of ten\nsyllables, and Agni is the Vira _g_  1; there are ten regions, and Agni is the\nregions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as\ngreat as is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[293:1](sbe4154.htm#fr_550) The ashes removed from the 'ukha' or fire-pan are\nput in a bag made of leaves of some sacred tree, and are then thrown into the\nwater in two portions. As they are floating on the water, a small portion is\ntaken from them again with the little finger and put in the pan.\n\n[294:1](sbe4154.htm#fr_551) 'Pra-sad' (= pra-ap, Mahidhara) seems here really\nto have the p. 295 meaning of 'abhiprasad' or 'anuprasad,' as the accusative\ncan scarcely be taken along with 'asada _h_.'\n\n[295:1](sbe4154.htm#fr_552) See [p. 249](sbe4145.htm#page_249), note\n[3](sbe4145.htm#fn_486).\n\n[296:1](sbe4154.htm#fr_553) Viz. the four cardinal points, and the four\nintermediate points, of the compass, and the upper region.
