I pour out to thee for the early draught[1](sbe3217.htm#an_1:19:9:1) the\nsweet (juice) of Soma; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!\n\np. 54\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Medhatithi, of the family of Ka _n_ va. Verse I = SV\nI, 16.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nWilson: Earnestly art thou invoked to this perfect rite, to drink the Soma\njuice; come, Agni, with the Maruts.\n\nBenfey: Zu diesem schonen Opfer wirst du gerufen, zum Trank der Milch!--Mit\ndiesen Marut's, Agni! komm!\n\nLudwig: Her zu diesem schonen opfer, gerufen wirst zum milchtrank du, mit den\nMarut, Agni, kom.\n\nNote 1. Gopitha is explained by Yaska and Saya _n_ a as drinking of Soma. I\nhave kept to the literal signification of the word, a draught of milk. In the\nlast verse of our hymn the libation offered to Agni and the Maruts is said to\nconsist of Soma, but Soma was commonly mixed with milk. The other meaning\nassigned to gopitha, protection, would give the sense: 'Thou art called for\nthe sake of protection.' But pitha has clearly the sense of drinking in soma-\npitha, RV. I, 51, 7, and may therefore be taken in the same sense in gopitha.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nWilson: No god nor man has power over a rite (dedicated) to thee, who art\nmighty: come, Agni, with the Maruts.\n\nBenfey: Denn nicht ein Gott, kein Sterblicher ragt uber dein, des Grossen,\nMacht--Mit diesen Marut's, Agni! komm!\n\nLudwig: Es uberragt kein gott, kein sterblicher die einsicht dein des grossen,\nmit den Marut, Agni, kom.\n\nNote 1. The Sanskrit kratu expresses power both of body and mind. Para _h_\ngoverns the accusative.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nWilson: Who all are divine, and devoid of malignity.\n\np. 55\n\nand who know (how to cause the descent) of great waters: come, Agni, with the\nMaruts.\n\nBenfey: Die guten Gotter, welche all bestehen in dem weiten Raum--Mit diesen\nMarut's, Agni! komm!\n\nLudwig: Die wissen um den grossen raum, alle gotter truges bar, mit den Marut,\nAgni, kom.\n\nNote 1. The sky or welkin (ra _g_ as) is the proper abode of the Maruts, and\n'they who know of' means simply 'they who dwell' in the great sky. The Vedic\npoets distinguish commonly between the three worlds, the earth, p _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4,\nf., or pa\xc2\xb4rthiva, n.; the sky, ra _g_ as; and the heaven, dyu: see I, 6, 9,\nnote 1. The phrase maha _h_ ra _g_ asa _h_ occurs I, 6, 10; 168, 6, &c. Saya\n_n_ a takes ra _g_ as for water or rain: see on this my article in Kuhn's\nZeitschrift, vol. xii, p. 28. In some passages ra _g_ as means 'darkness,' and\nmight be identified with the Greek \xe1\xbc\x9c\xcf\x81\xce\xb5\xce\xb2\xce\xbf\xcf\x82; Ath. Veda VIII, 2, 1. parayami tva\nra _g_ asa ut tva m _ri_ tyor apiparam, 'I bring thee out of darkness, out of\ndeath I brought thee.' The identification of ra _g_ as with \xe1\xbc\x94\xcf\x81\xce\xb5\xce\xb2\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 (Leo Meyer,\nin Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. vi, p. 19) must however remain doubtful, until\nstronger evidence has been brought forward in support of a Greek \xce\xb2\nrepresenting a Sanskrit _g_ , even in the middle of a word. See my article in\nKuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xv, p. 215; Curtius. Grundzuge (fifth edition), p.\n480.\n\nNote 2. The appellation Vi _s_ ve deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ , all gods together, or, more\nproperly, host-gods, is often applied to the Maruts; cf. I, 23, 8; 10. Benfey\nconnects this line with the preceding verse, considering Vi _s_ ve deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ ,\nit seems, inappropriate as an epithet of the Maruts.\n\nNote 3. On adruh, without guile or deceit, without hatred, see Kuhn's\nexcellent article, Zeitschrift fur die Vergleichende Sprachforschung, vol. i,\npp. 179, 193. Adruh is applied to the Maruts again in VIII, 46, 4, though in\nconnection with other gods. It is applied to the Vi _s_ ve Devas, RV. I, 3, 9;\nIX, 102, 5: the \xc3\x82dityas, RV. VIII, 19, 34; 67, 13: the Rudras, RV. IX, 73, 7:\nto Heaven and Earth, RV. II, 41, 21; III, 56, 1; IV, 56, 2; VII, 66, 18: to\nMitra and Varu _n_ a, RV. V, 68, 4: to Agni, RV. VI, 15, 7; VIII, 44, 10. The\nform adhruk occurs in the sixth Ma _n_ _d_ ala only.\n\np. 56\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nWilson: Who are fierce, and send down rain, and are unsurpassed in strength:\ncome, Agni, with the Maruts.\n\nBenfey: Die schrecklich-unbesiegbaren, die machtiglich Licht angefacht--Mit\ndiesen Marut's, Agni! komm!\n\nLudwig: Die singen, die gewaltigen, ihr lied unangegriffen durch (ihre) kraft,\nmit den Marut, Agni, kom.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a explains arka by water. Hence Wilson: 'Who are fierce and\nsend down rain.' But arka has only received this meaning of water in the\nartificial system of interpretation first started by the authors of the Brahma\n_n_ as, who had lost all knowledge of the natural sense of the ancient hymns.\nThe passages in which arka is explained as water in the Brahma _n_ as are\nquoted by Saya _n_ a, but they require no refutation. On the singing of the\nMaruts, see note to I, 38, 15; also Bergaigne, Journ. As. 1884, p. 194. The\nperfect in the Veda, like the perfect in Homer, has frequently to be rendered\nin English by the present.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nWilson: Who are brilliant, of terrific forms, who are possessors of great\nwealth, and are devourers of the malevolent: come, Agni, with the Maruts.\n\nBenfey: Die glanzend-grau'ngestaltigen, hochherrschend feindvernichtenden--Mit\ndiesen Marut's, Agni! komm!\n\nLudwig: Die glanzvollen, von schrecklicher gestalt, von grosser herschaft,\nfeindverzerer, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nWilson: Who are divinities abiding in the radiant heaven above the sun: come,\nAgni, with the Maruts.\n\nBenfey: Die Gotter die im Himmel sind ob dem Lichtkreis des Gottersitz's--Mit\ndiesen Marut's, Agni! komm!\n\nLudwig: Die ob der himmeiswolbung glanz, am himel die gotter sitzen, mit den\nMarut, Agni, kom.\n\nNote 1. Na\xc2\xb4ka must be translated by firmament, as there\n\np. 57\n\nis no other word in English besides heaven, and that is wanted to render dyu.\nLike the Jewish firmament, the Indian na\xc2\xb4ka, too, is adorned with stars; cf.\nI, 68, 10. pipe _s_ a na\xc2\xb4kam st _r i_bhi _h_. Dyu, heaven, is supposed to be\nabove the ra _g_ as, sky or welkin. Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xii, p. z8.\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'In the radiant heaven above the sun.' See note 1 to I, 6, 9; p.\n49.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nWilson: Who scatter the clouds, and agitate the sea (with waves): come, Agni,\nwith the Maruts.\n\nBenfey: Welche uber das wogende Meer hinjagen die Wolkenschaar--Mit diesen\nMarut's, Agni! komm!\n\nLudwig: Die die berge wiegend hindurch durchs wogenmeer bewegen, mit den\nMarut, Agni, kom.\n\nNote 1. That parvata (mountain) is used in the sense of cloud, without any\nfurther explanation, is clear from many passages:\n\nI, 57, 6. tvam tam indra parvatam maha\xc2\xb4m urum va _g_ re _n_ a va _g_ rin\nparva- _s_ a _h_ _k_ akartitha.\n\nThou, Indra, hast cut this great broad cloud to pieces with thy lightning. Cf.\nI, 85, 10.\n\nWe actually find two similes mixed up together, such as V, 32, 2. u\xc2\xb4dha _h_\nparvatasya, the udder of the cloud. All we can do is to translate parvata by\nmountain, but always to remember that mountain means cloud. In the Edda, too,\nthe rocks, said to have been fashioned out of Ymir's bones, are supposed to be\nintended for clouds. In Old Norse klakkr means both cloud and rock; nay, the\nEnglish word cloud itself has been identified with the Anglo-Saxon clud, rock.\nSee Justi, Orient and Occident, vol. ii, p. 62. See Grimm, Deutsche Grammatik,\n13, 398, 424; also Kuhn, Weisse Frau, p. 12.\n\nNote 2. Whether the surging sea is to be taken for the sea or for the air,\ndepends on the view which we take of the earliest cosmography of the Vedic\n_Ri_ shis. Saya _n_ a explains: 'They who make the clouds to go, and stir the\n\np. 58\n\nwatery sea.' Wilson remarks that the influence of the winds upon the sea,\nalluded to in this and the following verse, indicates more familiarity with\nthe ocean than we should have expected from the traditional inland position of\nthe early Hindus, and it has therefore been supposed by others that, even in\npassages like our own, samudra was meant for the sky, the waters above the\nfirmament. But although there are passages in the Rig-veda where samudra must\nbe taken to mean the welkin (RV. I, 95, 3. samudra ekam divi ekam ap-su), this\nword shows in by far the larger number of passages the clear meaning of ocean.\nThere is one famous passage, VII, 95, 2, which proves that the Vedic poets,\nwho were supposed to have known the upper courses only of the rivers of the\nPenjab, had followed the greatest and most sacred of their rivers, the\nSarasvati, as far as the Indian ocean. It is well known that, as early as the\ncomposition of the laws of the Manavas, and possibly as early as the\ncomposition of the Sutras on which these metrical laws are based, the river\nSarasvati had changed its course, and that the place where that river\ndisappeared under ground was called Vina _s_ ana a, the loss. This Vina _s_\nana forms, according to the laws of the Manavas, the western frontier of\nMadhyade _s_ a, the eastern frontier being formed by the confluence of the\nGanga and Yamuna. Madhyade _s_ a is a section of \xc3\x82ryavarta, the abode of the\n\xc3\x82ryas in the widest sense. \xc3\x82ryavarta shares with Madhyade _s_ a the same\nfrontiers in the north and the south, viz. the Himalaya and Vindhya mountains,\nbut it extends beyond Madhyade _s_ a to the west and east as far as the\nwestern and eastern seas. A section of Madhyade _s_ a, again, is the country\ndescribed as that of the Brahmarshis, which comprises only Kurukshetra, the\ncountries of the Matsyas, Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas (Kanyakub _g_ a, according to\nKulluka), and _S_ urasenas (Mathura, according to Kulluka). The most sacred\nspot of all, however, is that section of the Brahmarshi country which lies\nbetween the rivers D _ri_ shadvati and Sarasvati, and which in the laws of\n\np. 59\n\nthe Manavas is called Brahmavarta. In the Sutras which supplied the material\nto the authors of the metrical law-books, the Vina _s_ ana is mentioned for\nthe first time in the Baudhayana Sutras, I, 2, 9, '\xc3\x82ryavarta lies to the east\nof the region where (the Sarasvati) disappears, to the west of the Black-\nforest, to the north of the Paripatra (mountains), to the south of the\nHimalaya.' The name of the Sarasvati is not mentioned, but no other river can\nbe understood. What is curious, however, is, that in the Vasish _th_ a Sutras\nwhere the same frontiers of \xc3\x82ryavarta are given (I, 8), the MSS. read\noriginally prag adar _s_ at, i. e. east of the \xc3\x82dar _s_ a mountains, which was\nafterwards changed into prag adar _s_ anat, and interpreted 'east of the\ninvisibility, or of the disappearance of the Sarasvati.' Vasish _th_ a quotes\nanother authority, a Gatha of the Bhallavins, which says: 'In the west the\nboundary river,' i. e. sindhur vidhara _n_ i. This sindhur vidhara _n_ i is\nanother name of the old Sarasvati, and in Baudhayana I, 2, 12, the same verse\nis quoted, though the reading of vidhara _n_ i varies with vi _k_ ara _n_ i\nand visara _n_ i. See Buhler, l. c. Madhyade _s_ a is mentioned in one of the\nPari _s_ ish _t_ as (MS. 510, Wilson) as a kind of model country, but it is\nthere described as lying east of Da _s_ ar _n_ a a, west of Kampilya b, north\nof Pariyatra c, and south of the Himavat, or again, in a more general way, as\nthe Duab of the Ganga and Yamuna d.\n\nIt is very curious that while in the later Sanskrit literature\n\np. 60\n\nthe disappearance of the Sarasvati in the desert is a fact familiar to every\nwriter, no mention of it should occur during the whole of the Vedic period,\nand it is still more curious that in one of the hymns of the Rig-veda we\nshould have a distinct statement that the Sarasvati fell into the sea:\n\nVII, 95, 1-2. pra kshodasa dha\xc2\xb4yasa sasre esha\xc2\xb4 sarasvati dharu _n_ am a\xc2\xb4yasi\npu\xc2\xb4 _h_ , pra-ba\xc2\xb4badhana rathya\xcc\x83-iva yati vi _s_ va _h_ apa _h_ mahina\xc2\xb4 sindhu\n_h_ anya\xc2\xb4 _h_. eka a _k_ etat sarasvati nadi\xc2\xb4nam _s_ u _k_ i _h_ yati\xc2\xb4 giri-\nbhya _h_ a\xc2\xb4 samudra\xc2\xb4t, raya _h_ _k_ etanti bhuvanasya bhu\xc2\xb4re _h_ gh _ri_ tam\npaya _h_ duduhe na\xc2\xb4hushaya.\n\n1\\. 'With her fertilising stream this Sarasvati comes forth--(she is to us) a\nstronghold, an iron gate. Moving along as on a chariot, this river surpasses\nin greatness all other waters. 2. Alone among all rivers Sarasvati listened,\nshe who goes pure from the mountains as far as the sea. She who knows of the\nmanifold wealth of the world, has poured out to man her fat milk.'\n\nHere we see samudra used clearly in the sense of sea, the Indian sea, and we\nhave at the same time a new indication of the distance which separates the\nVedic age from that of the later Sanskrit literature. Though it may not be\npossible to determine by geological evidence the time of the changes which.\nmodified the southern area of the Penjab and caused the Sarasvati to disappear\nin the desert, still the fact remains that the loss of the Sarasvati is later\nthan the Vedic age, and that at that time the waters of the Sarasvati reached\nthe sea. Professor Wilson had observed long ago in reference to the rivers of\nthat part of India, that there have been, no doubt, considerable changes here,\nboth in the nomenclature and in the courses of the rivers, and this remark has\nbeen fully confirmed by later observations. I believe it can be proved that in\nthe Vedic age the Sarasvati was a river as large as the Sutlej, that it was\nthe last of the rivers of the Penjab, and therefore the iron gate, or the real\nfrontier against the rest of India. At present the Sarasvati is so small a\nriver that the epithets applied to the Sarasvati in the Veda have become quite\ninapplicable to it. The Vedic _Ri_ shis, though acquainted with numerous\nrivers, including\n\np. 61\n\nthe Indus and Ganges, call the Sarasvati the mother of rivers (VII, 36, 6.\nsarasvati saptathi sindhu-mata), the strongest of rivers (VI, 61, 13. apasam\napa _h_ -tama), and in our passage, VII, 95, 2, we have, as far as I can\njudge, conclusive evidence that the old Sarasvati reached in its course the\nIndian sea, either by itself, or united with the Indus a.\n\nBut this passage, though important as showing the application of samudra, i.\ne. confluvies, to the Indian sea, and proving the acquaintance of the Vedic\n_Ri_ shis with the southern coast of India, is by no means the only one in\nwhich samudra must be translated by sea. Thus we read, VII, 49, 2:\n\nya\xc2\xb4 _h_ a\xc2\xb4pa _h_ divya\xc2\xb4 _h_ uta va sravanti khanitrima _h_ uta va ya\xc2\xb4 _h_\nsvayam-ga\xc2\xb4 _h_ , samudra-artha _h_ ya\xc2\xb4 _h_ _s_ u _k_ aya _h_ pavaka\xc2\xb4 _h_ ta\xc2\xb4\n_h_ a\xc2\xb4pa _h_ devi\xc2\xb4 _h_ iha ma\xc2\xb4m avantu.\n\nThe waters which are from heaven, or those which flow after being dug, or\nthose which spring up by themselves, the bright, pure waters that tend to the\nsea, may those divine waters protect me here!\n\nI, 71, 7. agnim vi _s_ va _h_ abhi p _r i_ksha _h_ sa _k_ ante samudram na\nsravata _h_ sapta yahvi\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nAll kinds of food go to Agni, as the seven rivers go to the sea.\n\nCf. I, 190, 7. samudram na sravata _h_ rodha- _k_ akra _h_.\n\nV, 78, 8. yatha va\xc2\xb4ta _h_ yatha vanam yatha samudra _h_ e _g_ ati.\n\nAs the wind moves, as the forest moves, as the sea moves (or the sky).\n\nIn hymn X, 58, the same expression occurs which we have in our hymn, and\nsamudram ar _n_ avam there as here admits but of one explanation, the surging\nsea.\n\nSamudra in many passages of the Rig-veda has to be taken as an adjective, in\nthe sense of watery or flowing:\n\nVI, 58, 3. ya\xc2\xb4s te pushan na\xc2\xb4va _h_ anta _h_ samudre hira _n_ yayi _h_\nantarikshe _k_ aranti.\n\nThy golden ships, O Pushan, which move within the watery sky.\n\np. 62\n\nVII, 70, 2. ya _h_ vam samudra\xc2\xb4n sarita _h_ piparti.\n\nHe who carries you across the watery rivers.\n\nI, 161, 14. at-bhi _h_ yati varu _n_ a _h_ samudrai _h_.\n\nVaru _n_ a moves in the flowing waters.\n\nIn both these passages samudra, as an adjective, does not conform to the\ngender of the noun. See Bollensen, Orient und Occident, vol. ii, p. 467.\n\nII, 16, 3. na samudrai _h_ parvatai _h_ indra te ratha _h_ (na pari-bhve\xcc\x83).\n\nThy chariot, O Indra, is not to be overcome by the watery clouds.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nWilson: Who spread (through the firmament), along with the rays (of the sun),\nand, with their strength, agitate the ocean: come, Agni, with the Maruts.\n\nBenfey: Die mit Blitzen schleuderen machtig uber das Meer hinaus--Mit diesen\nMarut's, Agni! komm!\n\nLudwig: Die mit stralen ihre richtung nemen mit gewalt durchs mer, mit den\nMarut, Agni, kom.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nWilson: I pour out the sweet Soma juice for thy drinking, (as) of old: come,\nAgni, with the Maruts.\n\nBenfey: Ich giesse zu dem ersten Trank fur dich des Soma Honig aus--Mit diesen\nMarut's, Agni! komm!\n\nLudwig: Ich giesze dir zum ersten trunk madhu mit dem soma zu; mit den Marut,\nAgni, kom.\n\nNote 1. Purvapiti, the early draught, implies at the same time the priority of\nthe god to whom it is given.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:a](sbe3217.htm#fr_96) Mentioned in La _t_ y. _S_ rauta Sutras, X, 15, 1;\nPa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avi _m_ _s_ a Brahm.
