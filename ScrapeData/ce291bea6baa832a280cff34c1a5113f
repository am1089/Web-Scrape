How, we ask, can any\none assert that bondage--which consists in the experience of pleasure and pain\ncaused by the connexion of souls with bodies of various kind, a connexion\nspringing from good or evil actions--is something false, unreal? And that the\ncessation of such bondage is to be obtained only through the grace of the\nhighest Self pleased by the devout meditation of the worshipper, we have\nalready explained. As the cognition of universal oneness which you assume\nrests on a view of things directly contrary to reality, and therefore is\nfalse, the only effect it can have is to strengthen the ties of bondage.\nMoreover, texts such as 'But different is the highest Person' (Bha. Gi. XV,\n17), and 'Having known the Self and the Mover as separate' ( _S_ vet. Up. I,\n6), teach that it is the cognition of Brahman as the inward ruler different\nfrom the individual soul, that effects the highest aim of man, i.e. final\nrelease. And, further, as that 'bondage-terminating' knowledge which you\nassume is itself unreal, we should have to look out for another act of\ncognition to put an end to it.--But may it not be said that this terminating\ncognition, after having put an end to the whole aggregate of distinctions\nantagonistic to it, immediately passes away itself, because being of a merely\n\np. 146\n\ninstantaneous nature?--No, we reply. Since its nature, its origination, and\nits destruction are all alike fictitious, we have clearly to search for\nanother agency capable of destroying that avidya which is the cause of the\nfiction of its destruction!--Let us then say that the essential nature of\nBrahman itself is the destruction of that cognition!--From this it would\nfollow, we reply, that such 'terminating' knowledge would not arise at all;\nfor that the destruction of what is something permanent can clearly not\noriginate!--Who moreover should, according to you, be the cognising subject in\na cognition which has for its object the negation of everything that is\ndifferent from Brahman?--That cognising subject is himself something\nfictitiously superimposed on Brahman!--This may not be, we reply: he himself\nwould in that case be something to be negatived, and hence an object of the\n'terminating' cognition; he could not therefore be the subject of cognition!--\nWell, then, let us assume that the essential nature of Brahman itself is the\ncognising subject!--Do you mean,we ask in reply, that Brahman's being the\nknowing subject in that 'terminating' cognition belongs to Brahman's essential\nnature, or that it is something fictitiously superimposed on Brahman? In the\nlatter case that superimposition and the Nescience founded on it would\npersist, because they would not be objects of the terminating cognition, and\nif a further terminating act of knowledge were assumed, that also would\npossess a triple aspect (viz. knowledge, object known, and subject knowing),\nand we thus should be led to assume an infinite series of knowing subjects.\nIf, on the other band, the essential nature of Brahman itself constitutes the\nknowing subject, your view really coincides with the one held by us. 1 And if\nyou should say that the terminating knowledge itself and the knowing subject\nin it are things separate from Brahman and themselves contained in the sphere\nof what is to be terminated by that knowledge, your statement would be no less\nabsurd than if you were to say 'everything on the surface of the earth has\nbeen cut\n\np. 147\n\ndown by Devadatta with one stroke'--meaning thereby that Devadatta himself and\nthe action of cutting down are comprised among the things cut down!--The\nsecond alternative, on the other hand--according to which the knowing subject\nis not Brahman itself, but a knower superimposed upon it--would imply that\nthat subject is the agent in an act of knowledge resulting in his own\ndestruction; and this is impossible since no person aims at destroying\nhimself. And should it be said that the destruction of the knowing agent\nbelongs to the very nature of Brahman itself 1, it would follow that we can\nassume neither plurality nor the erroneous view of plurality, nor avidya as\nthe root of that erroneous view.--All this confirms our theory, viz. that\nsince bondage springs from a _gn_ ana in the form of an eternal stream of\nkarman, it can be destroyed only through knowledge of the kind maintained by\nus. Such knowledge is to be attained only through the due daily performance of\nreligious duties as prescribed for a man's caste and a _s_ rama, such\nperformance being sanctified by the accompanying thought of the true nature of\nthe Self, and having the character of propitiation of the highest Person. Now,\nthat mere works produce limited and non-permanent results only, and that on\nthe other hand works not aiming at an immediate result but meant to please the\nhighest Person, bring about knowledge of the character of devout meditation,\nand thereby the unlimited and permanent result of the intuition of Brahman\nbeing the Self of all--these are points not to be known without an insight\ninto the nature of works, and hence, without this, the attitude described--\nwhich is preceded by the abandonment of mere works--cannot be reached. For\nthese reasons the enquiry into Brahman has to be entered upon _after_ the\nenquiry into the nature of works.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[146:1](sbe48033.htm#fr_24) According to which Brahman is not _g \xc3\xb1_anam, but\n_g \xc3\xb1_at _ri_.\n\n[147:1](sbe48033.htm#fr_25) And, on that account, belongs to what constitutes\nman's highest aim.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vedantin aiming to ascertain the nature of Brahman from\nScripture,...](sbe48034.htm)\n\n"
