When he beheld Shree Krishnu Chund at a distance, dismounting from his\nelephant, he came bare-footed and trembling, with a cloth thrown about his\nneck, and fell at the feet of Krishnu; and expressing great regret, and\nshedding tears began to say, "O lord of Bruj! have mercy on me. I have been\nvery proud, and presumptuous; and have given up my mind to sensual enjoyment\nand illusion. Intoxicated with wealth I have placed my enjoyment in riches.\nYour nature I have not understood at all; you are god, the lord of all; who,\nexcept you, is the lord of the world? Bruhmu, Roodru and all others, who grant\nboons, have obtained prosperity by your gift. You are lord of the world,\ndwelling in the Vedas. Luchmee, constantly attending on you, has become your\nservant. You descend upon the earth for men\'s sake; and\n\np. 94\n\nthen remove all the burthens of the earth. Put away all my faults: I have been\nvery presumptuous and foolish."\n\nWhen Indru had eulogized Krishnu with such humility, Shree Krishnu Chund,\ntaking compassion on him, said, "You have come now with the cow Ramdhenoo;\nand, therefore, I pardon your sin. Do not again indulge in pride, because by\ndoing so the understanding is destroyed: and foolishness, from which\ndisrespect proceeds, is increased."\n\nOn hearing these words from the mouth of Shree Krishnu, Indru having risen,\nperformed poojah according to the injunctions of the Vedas; and having\npronounced the name of Gobind, took the water, in which his feet had been\nwashed, and circled to the right hand by way of adoration of Krishnu. At this\ntime the heavenly musicians, playing upon instruments of different kinds,\nbegan to celebrate the praises of Shree Krishnu; and the gods, seated in their\nchariots, to rain down flowers from the sky. And the crisis appeared the same,\nas if Shree Krishnu had been born for the second time.\n\nWhen Indru had finished the poojah, he stood before Krishnu with hands joined:\nand Shree Krishnu gave him the order to return to leis own city With the cow\nRamdhenoo. On receiving the order, Ramdhenoo and Indru taking their\ndepartures, after having made obeisance, went to the region of Indru. And\nShree Krishnu Chund having allowed the cows to graze, returned, in the evening\nwith all the cowherds\' children to Brindabun. They having gone to their homes,\nrelated that they had that day seen Indru in the jungle, through the glory of\nHuri.\n\nHaving related so much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--Raja! by hearing and reciting this account of Shree Gobind, which\nI have narrated to you, the four blessings of religion, substance, desire and\ndeliverance are obtained in the world.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXIX](psa30.htm)\n\n'
