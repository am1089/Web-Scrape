Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing that the wife of Indra had taken refuge\nunder Brihaspati, the King Nahu _s_ a became very angry towards Brihaspati and\nspoke to the Devas :-- \xc2\x93 O Devas! I hear that the stupid son of Angirasa has\ngiven protection to Indra and has kept her in his house; I will therefore kill\nhim quickly.\xc2\x94 Seeing the terrible Nahu _s_ a thus angry, the Devas and Ri _s_\nis consoled him and said :-- O King of kings! Do not be angry; quit this\nvicious motive yours. See, the Ri _s_ is in all the Dharma S'astras, have\ndeclared the holding of illicit connection with other's wives as a very\nheinous crime and have blamed it very much. You can consider that the daughter\nof Puloma is always chaste, devoted to her husband and very good-natured. How\ncan she, when her husband is alive, take another husband? O Lord! You are now\nthe Lord of the three worlds and hence the Defender of Faith and Religion; and\nif a person like you act irreligiously, all the subjects will then go to\nannihilation. One who is a Lord should always observe the rules of good\nconduct. Besides there are many\n\n\n\np. 508\n\n\n\nother celestial women in this Heaven as beautiful as S'achi; you can satisfy\nyour thirst with them. Mutual love is recognised by the wise as the true\noriginator of amorous dealings; ravishing a woman by force destroys all\namorous sentiments. O King! And if the mutual love be similar and equal in all\nrespects, then comes the true happiness; you have now got the post of Indra;\ntherefore quit this idea of holding illicit connection with other's wives and\nindulge in other good thoughts. Demerits destroy prosperity and merits\nincrease it. Therefore, O King! Leave all these bad thoughts and make your\nheart take a good turn and be happy.\n\n\n\n12-15. Nahu _s_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! Where were you all when Indra stole away\nthe wife of Gautama and when the Moon stole away the wife of Brihaspati? It is\neasy to give advice to others but to act according to that is very rare in\nthis world. O Devas! Let the qualified Devi come to me you will derive much\nbenefit from it and the Devi, too, will get Her highest happiness; there is no\ndoubt in this. I tell you truly that in no other way I will be satisfied;\nbring Indrani here quickly, whether by good words or by force.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n16-17. The Devas and Munis heard the words of the king Nahu _s_ a, smitten by\nthe Cupid's arrows, got terrified and said :-- \xc2\x93We will bring Indrani to you\nby gentle words.\xc2\x94 Saying thus, they went to the house of Brihaspati.\n\n\n\n18-21. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Devas, going to the house of Brihaspati,\nspoke thus with folded hands :-- O Guru! We know that Indrani has taken\nshelter in your house; we will have to hand her over today to the king Nahu\n_s_ a for we all united have made over the post of Indra to Nahu _s_ a. Let\nthis beautiful Lady now choose and worship him. Hearing these awful words of\nthe Devas, Brihaspati said to them :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! This chaste woman, devoted to\nher husband, has now taken my shelter; therefore I can never part with her.\xc2\x94\nThe Devas said :-- \xc2\x93O Guru! Kindly advise then - if you do not part with\nS'achi Devi \\- how the king Nahu _s_ a be pleased; if he becomes angry, it\nwill then be very difficult to please him.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22-31. Brihaspati said :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! Let S'achi now go to Nahu _s_ a, and\ntempt him with enticing words and make this condition that when her husband's\ndeath will be known to her, she will then accept Nahu _s_ a as her husband.\nHow could she accept another husband when her husband was alive. Therefore let\nher now go in quest of her high-souled husband. Let S'achi thus make condition\nwith him and, thus deceiving him, let her try\n\n\n\np. 509\n\n\n\nher best to bring back her husband. O King! Then, after coming to this\nconclusion, Brihaspati and other Devas went with Indrani to the king Nahu _s_\na. Seeing them come, especially looking at Indrani the artificial king Nahu\n_s_ a became very glad and said to Indrani :-- \xc2\x93O Beloved! Today I am become\nthe real Indra. O beautiful-eyed One! Worship me as your husband; see the\nDevas now have made me to be worshipped by all the gods.\xc2\x94 When Nahu _s_ a\nspoke thus, the Devi S'achi became filled with great shame; she began to\ntremble and said to the king :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of the Devas! I desire to ask a boon\nfrom you. Better wait till I ascertain whether Indra is dead or alive, there\nis this doubt in my heart whether he lives or whether he is dead. O King of\nkings! Let me, first of all, clear my doubts. Kindly excuse me and wait till\nthen. I tell this truly that after I ascertain the fact, I will worship you. I\ndo not know anything whether Indra is dead or whether he has gone any where\nelse.\xc2\x94 When S'achi Devi spoke thus, Nahu _s_ a became very glad and saying\n\xc2\x93let it be so\xc2\x94 dismissed her.\n\n\n\n32-47. Thus having received permission from the King to depart, S'achi\nhurriedly went to the Devas and spoke to them to try their best to bring Indra\nback as soon as possible. O King! Hearing these sweet and holy words of\nIndrani the Devas intently consulted with each other how they could get back\nIndra. They then went to Vaikun _t_ ha and began to praise with hymns the\noriginal Deva, the God Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of the Universe, kind to those that\nseek His refuge. The Devas, skilled in speaking, spoke to Vi _sn_ u with a\nvery troubled heart :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Indra, the Lord of the Devas, is very much\ntroubled with his sin Brahmahattya. Where is he staying now, invisible to all\nthe beings? O Lord! He is now overcome with the sin Brahmahattya by killing V\n_r_ itra, the best of the Brahmi _n_ s. We ask your skilful and intelligent\nadvice. O Lord! You are the sole refuge of him as well as of us. We are now\ninvolved in a great difficulty. Kindly show us the way how we, as well as\nIndra, can get out of this difficult crisis.\xc2\x94 Hearing the pitiful words of the\nDevas, Vi _sn_ u said :-- Let Indra perform the As'vamedha sacrifice (Horse\nsacrifice) for the purification of his sins. By this Yaj\xc3\xb1a, that can destroy\nall sins, Indra will be purified and he will regain his Indraship; there is no\ndoubt in this. The more so because the Devi, the Universal Mother, will be\npleased with his Horse sacrifice and will destroy all his sins, Brahmahattya\nand others. Lo! Merely remembering Her destroys heaps of sins; and, if by this\nHorse sacrifice, She be pleased, what wonder is there that sins of a more\ngrave nature would be destroyed! And let Indrani worship Bhagavati daily;\nhappiness will undoubtedly be gained by worshipping that most Auspicious One!\nBy this the King Nahu _s_ a will be particularly deluded by the World\n\n\n\np. 510\n\n\n\nMother and will then be quickly destroyed by the sin committed by himself. And\nIndra, purified by As'vamedha, will soon regain his position and all his\nwealth. O king! Thus hearing the sweet beneficial words of Vi _sn_ u of\nindomitable prowess, the Devas went to the spot, where resided Indra.\nBrihaspati and the other Devas consoled the distressed Indra and made him\ncelebrate duly in right order, the Horse sacrifice the greatest of all\nsacrifices. Indra then distributed his sin Brahmahattya amongst the trees,\nrivers, mountains, women, and the earth.\n\n\n\n48-51. Thus casting aside his sin on all the above things, Indra became again\nfree from his sin, and, getting rid of his fever and uneasiness, abided by the\ntime and remained there invisible in the tubular stem of the lotus. Doing that\nwonderful act, the Devas started from there and reached their own abodes. The\ndaughter of Puloma, suffering from her bereavements from Indra, spoke then to\nBrihaspati with great sorrow :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Why is my husband still invisible to\nme, when he has performed the As'vamedha sacrifice? Kindly show me the way how\nI can get a sight of him.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n52-62. Brihaspati said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! Worship the most Auspicious Bhagavati;\nsurely She will make your husband sinless and you will see him. The Devi\nAmbika, the Upholdress of the Universe, will desist the King Nahu _s_ a from\ndoing the wrongful act and it is She that will delude him by Her Maya and get\nhis downfall from the Heavens. O King! When Brihaspati spoke thus, S'achi Devi\ngot initiated by him in the Devi Mantram, capable to secure success in any\nundertaking. Thus getting the Mantram from her Guru, She began to worship the\nDevi Bhuvane'svari duly with flowers, sacrificial victims and other necessary\narticles for worship. Thus Indrani, with a view to see her husband, performed\nthe worship of the Devi; she quitted all the articles of enjoyment and luxury\nand assumed the garb of an ascetic; thus some time passed away, when the Devi\nwas pleased and appeared before her on the back of a Swan, in Her peaceful\nform, ready to grant boons to Indrani. She looked, then, fiery like thousands\nof Moons; Her lovely beauty appeared in rays like thousands and thousands of\nfixed lightnings. The four Vedas personified began to praise Her in hymns from\nthe four sides. Her two hands were adorned with a noose and a goad, and Her\ntwo other hands made signs to grant boons and to discard all fear. The\nVaijayanti garland of clear crystal-like gems suspended from Her neck up to\nHer feet. Her face was adorned with smiles and signs as if she would grant\nfavours. She had three eyes and was the ocean of mercy and the Mother of all\nthe Jivas from a worm up to Brahma. Her two heavy breasts were filled with\n\n\n\np. 511\n\n\n\nunbounded ocean of nectar-like juice of Peace and Mukti. She was the Goddess\nof innumerable worlds, the Goddess of all and the Highest, endowed with all\nthe knowledges and the Incarnate of the Undecaying and Immoveable Brahma. The\nDevi, then, began to address S'achi, the wife of Indra, in pleasant words and\nin voice deep like a rolling thunder.\n\n\n\n63-69. The Devi said :-- O Darling to Indra! Better now ask your desired boon.\nI am much pleased with your worship. O Beautiful One! I have come here to\ngrant you boon. To see Me is not an easy task; by the collected merits,\nacquired in thousands and thousands of births one is able to See Me. Hearing\nthe words of the Devi, S'achi Devi, the wife of Indra, fell prostrate before\nHer feet and began to speak to the Highest Goddess, the Bhagavati, Who seemed\ngraciously pleased :-- \xc2\x93O Mother! I now desire from Thee, that I may see my\nhusband whom I attained after great difficulty, that I be freed from the fear\narising out of King Nahu _s_ a and I want that Indra be reinstated as Indra as\nhe was before.\xc2\x94 The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93O Lady of the Devas! Better go with this My\nmessenger (Duti) to Manasarovara; there is installed My fixed form, named\nVis'vakama. You will see your Indra staying there very sorrowful and\noverwhelmed with terror. I will delude the King Nahu _s_ a within a very short\nperiod. O large-eyed One! Be calm and quiet; I will fulfil your desires; soon\nI will delude that king and deprive him of the seat of Indra.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n70-71. Vyasa said :-- The wife of Indra accompanied the messenger of the Devi\nand quickly reached the presence of her husband Indra. She was very pleased to\nsee her long-wished for husband, in the state disguise.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the praising of the\nBhagavati by the wife of Indra and on getting the sight of Indra in the\nMahapura _n_ am, S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk06ch09.htm)\n\n"
