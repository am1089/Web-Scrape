Shree Krishnu Chund came to\nBrujmundul alone, having left Bulram Jee at Muttra: and went forth and stood\nin front of the army of Kaljumun, a sea of beauty, the light of the world,\ndressed in yellow silk, wearing a scarf of the same colour, and ornamented\nfrom head to foot. On seeing him, Kaljumun began to say, "This must be\nKrishnu, he has all the marks mentioned by Narud, the sage, it is he who has\ndestroyed Kuns and all evil spirits, and slaughtered the armies of\nJoorasindhoo." With these thoughts in his mind, Kaljumun called out, and said,\n"Why are you running away, Krishnu? Come here, you have now to deal with me,\nstand and fight. I am not Joorasindhoo nor Kuns. I will extirpate the whole\nrace of Judoo."\n\nRaja! having thus spoken, Kaljumun advanced alone in pursuit of Shree Krishnu\nChund, leaving his whole army behind him: but that fool did not understand\nKrishnu\'s nature. Krishnu ran on, and Kaljumun followed him at a hand\'s\ndistance, when he had advanced some distance, Krishnu entered a cave in a\nhill, where he saw a man lying asleep; having quickly put his yellow silk\nscarf upon him, he concealed himself apart on one side. Afterwards, Kaljumun\ncame running\n\np. 199\n\nand panting to the same very dark cave; and seeing a man asleep with a yellow\nscarf thrown over him, thought to himself, that it was Krishnu, pretending to\nbe asleep. O great king! thinking thus, and being angry, Kaljumun gave the\nsleeper a kick, and said, "O trickster! what deceit are you practising, in\npretending to be sleeping at your ease like an honest man? Rise, as I intend\nto kill you immediately." With these words he snatched away the yellow cloth\nfrom over him. He started up; and when he cast an angry look at Kaljumun, he\nwas burnt to ashes. At this part of the history, the Raja Pureechit said,\n"Explain to me, Basoodeo, who the man was, that had gone into the cave, by\nwhose look Kaljumun was reduced to ashes, who conferred a great boon on him?"\nShree Shookdeo, the sage, said,--O lord of the earth! it was Moochkoond,\nManghata\'s son, a Chutree of the family of Ichwak, very powerful and renowned;\nwhose fame, for destroying enemies and armies was spread over nine divisions\nof the earth. On one occasion, the gods, having been harassed by evil spirits,\ncame in great alarm to Moochkoond, and said in a tone of great supplication,\n"O great king! evil spirits have increased greatly; we cannot escape from\nthem, come quickly, and protect us." It has been an immemorial custom for\nChutrees to assist gods, sages and saints, when their own power fails them.\n\nOn hearing these words, Moochkoond accompanied them, and began to fight with\nthe evil spirits. The battle lasted for many ages, when the gods said to\nMoochkoond, "O great king! you have undergone great labour on our account;\nrest somewhere now, and give ease to your body. You have fought for many days;\nyour wealth, dwelling and family are all gone, not one of your relations is\nleft; do not therefore set foot in your own house. Go any where else you\nplease." Moochkoond said in reply to the gods, "O lords of the earth! kindly\npoint out to me some retired spot, where I may sleep, free from all care and\nanxiety, and no one awake me." The\n\np. 200\n\ngods were delighted at this speech, and said to Moochkoond, "O great king! go\nand sleep in the cave of the great white mountain. No one will awake you\nthere: and if any one should go there by accident, and do so, he will be burnt\nto ashes by a single glance of your eye."\n\nHaving proceeded thus fir in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee, said to the\nRaja,--O great king! having obtained this boon from the gods, Moochkoond went\nand dwelt in that cave; and therefore, Kaljumun was burnt to ashes by a glance\nfrom his eye. Shortly afterwards Krishnu, the abode of compassion, the\nbenefactor of his worshippers, of the colour of the clouds, with a face like\nthe moon, lotus eyes, four arms, and holding in his hand a shell, quoit, club\nand lotus, wearing a crown in the shape of a peacock, and ear-rings formed\nlike the sign Capricorn, having a garland reaching to his feet, and dressed in\nyellow silk, appeared to Moochkoond; who, on beholding him, prostrated\nhimself, so as to touch the ground with the eight principal parts of his body,\nand rising up, said with joined hands, "O lord of mercy! as you have come into\nthis great dark cave, and by your light have dispersed the darkness, please\ntake compassion on me; and explaining your name and nature, remove all the\ndoubts of my mind." Shree Krishnu Chund replied, "My births, destinies and\nattributes are manifold, and cannot be counted by any one, whatever\ncomputations he may make. But I will explain to you the secrets of my present\nbirth, to which listen. I have been born in the house of Basoodeo, and been\nnamed Basoodeo in consequence. And in the city of Muttra, I have destroyed\nKuns and all evil spirits, and removed -the burthens of the earth. And\nJoorasindhoo has been defeated by me, who attacked me seventeen times with\ntwenty-three armies. And this Kaljumun, who has been reduced to ashes by your\nglance had brought a mob of three crores of unclean persons to fight with me."\nWhen Krishnu had thus spoken, Moochkoond became possessed of knowledge, and\nsaid, "O great\n\np. 201\n\nking! your delusive power is exceedingly great; it has enchanted the whole\nworld; and under its influence no one\'s understanding and senses retain their\nbalance. All engage in schemes for the sake of happiness, and suffer calamity;\nas a dog, who, in gnawing a bone, sucks in his own blood, he thinks he sucks\nit from the bone, and looks upon calamity as a pleasure; and, O great king!\nwhoever comes into the world, cannot, without your favour, escape from this\ndark well, in the form of a dwelling; I am, therefore, anxious to know how I\nshall be released from it." Shree Krishnu Jee; said, "Listen, Moochkoond! the\ncase is as you have stated it: but I will explain to you a plan, by adopting\nwhich, you will obtain release. Having obtained royal authority, you have, for\nthe sake of land, wealth and women, committed many acts of injustice, which\ncannot be obliterated without the performance of penance. Wherefore, go to the\nNorthern quarter, and there practise religious austerity. On quitting your\npresent body, you shall be born again in the house of a holy man; and\nafterwards obtain salvation."\n\nWhen Moochkoond, O great king! heard these words, he thought the black age had\ncome; with these thoughts in his mind, he took leave of Krishnu, having made a\nsalutation, and circled to the right by way of adoration, and went to\nBudreenath. Shree Krishnu Chund having returned to Muttra, said to Bulram Jee,\n"I have extirpated Kaljumun, and sent Moochkoond towards Budreenath. The army,\nwith which Kaljumun has surrounded Muttra, is immense. Come, and let us kill\nthose impure wretches, and remove all the burthens of the earth."\n\nHaving thus spoken, Shree Krishnu Chund, accompanied by Bulram, went forth\nfront the city of Muttra, and came to the place where the army of Kaljumun was\nstanding in battle array; and on their arrival, they both began to fight with\nit. At length when, in the course of the battle, Krishnu had slaughtered all\nthe army of the barbarians, he said to Buldeo\n\np. 202\n\n[paragraph continues] Jee, "Brother! let us now take all the wealth of Muttra\nand send it to Dwarka." Bulram Jee assented; then Shree Krishnu Chund had all\nthe riches of Muttra brought out and laden on buffaloes, carts, camels and\nelephants, and sent to Dwarka.\n\nIn the mean while, Joorasindhoo made another attack upon Muttra, with twenty-\nthree complete armies. Shree Krishnu and Bulram came out in great alarm, and\nshowing themselves before Joorasindhoo ran off with a view of quieting the\ntroubles of his mind. A counsellor then said to Joorasindhoo, "O great king!\nwho is so powerful as to make a stand before your majesty? Behold the two\nbrothers, Krishnu and Bulram, running away from dread of you, leaving their\nwealth and home, and escaping with uncovered feet, with their lives alone."\n\nOn hearing these words from the minister, Joorasindhoo followed them with his\narmy, and called out, "Why are you flying from fear, stand, and do something?\nWhy do you tremble violently, whether lying down or sitting up? Your death is\nat hand."\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said, O lord of the\nearth! when Shree Krishnu and Buldeo Jee fled after the manner of mortals, all\nJoorasindhoo\'s former disasters were banished from his mind; and he was\nrejoiced beyond description. Shree Krishnu and Bulram ran on, and ascended a\nhill, named Guotum, which was forty-four coss high, and stood upon the summit\nof it. Joorasindhoo on perceiving this, exclaimed, "Bulbhuddru and Moorari\nhave ascended the peak of the hill. How can they escape me now? set fire to\nthe hill."\n\nWhen Joorasindhoo had thus spoken, all the evil spirits surrounded the hill;\nand bringing wood and doors from the towns and villages spread them on all\nsides of it: and throwing old clothes upon them, saturated with ghee and oil,\nset fire to the whole.\n\np. 203\n\nWhen the fire rose up in a flame to the top of the hill, the two brothers\ncontrived to take the road to Muttra, so as that no one saw them going; and\nthe hill was burnt to ashes. Joorasindhoo then supposing that Krishnu and\nBulram had been consumed by fire, together with the hill, was greatly\nrejoiced, and taking his whole army with him came to Muttra; and seizing the\ngovernment, issued a proclamation, establishing his own authority. He pulled\ndown all the old houses belonging to Oogursen and Basoodeo, and built new ones\nof his own.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja,\n--O great king! having thus deceived Joorasindhoo, Shree Krishnu and Bulram\nJee, went and abode at Dwarka; and Joorasindhoo also departed from Muttra with\nall his army; and returned home rejoicing, and without fear.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LIII](psa54.htm)\n\n'
