b"[![](../../cdshop/cdinfo.jpg)](../../cdshop/index.htm)  \n[Sacred Texts](../../index.htm)  [Hinduism](../index.htm)  [Index](index.htm)\n[Previous](vov06.htm)  [Next](vov08.htm)\n\n* * *\n\n500\n\nThe earth is the noble mother; the seed is the father, the crops are sons, the\nproduce of cattle (i.e., milk etc.), is heaven (because milk in various forms\nis offered in sacrifice), virtue is divinity. That is Truth.\n\n501\n\nThe farmer begins by cutting hastily down the flower gardens of the god to\nbuild gates for the sluice (with the planks of the trees). Sinners are they\nwho attempt such acts.\n\n502\n\nSorrow shall follow and seize him who wastes grain. If he possesses grain his\npain is over. In the veranda of the very whores of him who hath grain, men\nshall abjectly wait for gruel.\n\n503\n\nBread and water are the origin of the glory even to the Gods. In this iron age\nit is the seat of all virtues. Food is as the elder brother of all men (a\npun).\n\np. 127\n\n504\n\nFood puts an end to difficulties; food alone is the dwelling of life, beyond\nall other things. Are there any in this earth who desire not food (instance of\ncomparative?) If there be any, they must be none but Siva ( _Ugrudu_ ).\n\n505\n\nIf the beggar cries (Date obolum) he who replies 'Oho' how likely and asks him\nridiculous questions, where shall such fools acquire honours? They shall\nperish roots and branch in their avarice.\n\n506\n\nWhat honour or what shame can the mouth full of spittle, receive a buffalo\nmouth, (mouth as gaping as that of a [buffalo](errata.htm#85)) is like a dry\nwell. They cannot discern purity as they discern tastes.\n\n507\n\nHowever many curses (slaying words) we utter, they are but as wealth beheld in\na dream, all fleeting, but a single blessing (word of life) suffices--it is\nunexhaustible as the mines of the Ocean.\n\np. 128\n\n508\n\nHe who after receiving the value the mortgage usurps, more than was settled\nshall lose that surplus and the original article alone shall be his.\n\n509\n\nInordinate enjoyment occasions the loss of the original possession. Property\nput in pledge suffers a certain degree of loss. In the first case the original\npossessor sustains a loss.\n\n510\n\nIf when the assembly has met, you give the full price, the cost will all be\npaid, but if instead of payment you give a bond with interest for it, it will\noccasion a heavy loss.\n\n511\n\nWhen a sale is made if a single farthing remains unpaid, a covetous desire may\narise. If the property you have purchased come not into your possession\nwithout delay, you suffer loss.\n\n512\n\np. 129\n\nIf thou enjoy personal possession of the land and hold it for twenty years,\nthis forms a strong title to it. Enjoyment constitutes the basis of written\ndeeds.\n\n513\n\nIf such a possessor holds undisturbed enjoyment of the land for twenty years--\nthough the written deed exists or destroyed, enjoyment constitutes the\nstrongest title to the possession.\n\n514\n\nIn this world thou attain possession--the written documents form the strongest\ninstrument of right. Consider enjoyment as the mother of the title deed.\n\n515\n\nIn gift or sale you may dispose of what is your own. But cannot give to others\nthat which belongs to your neighbour. If others give their countenance to such\nacts, yet how can it pass valid on the earth.\n\n516\n\nThis man, void of all caste is the _yogee_ worthy of honour. He is cautious as\na cubbed tigress. The words of his rectitude shall never cease (very\ndifficult).\n\np. 130\n\n517\n\n(Pure sanskrit) By the possession of the four methods (gentleness, liberality,\nalso the unison of discrimination, punishment) giving, secrecy, resolution,\nwealth and readiness--by these, the unparalleled man is king (very difficult).\n\n518\n\nHe who nourishes the earth, who relieves dependants, who foresees what shall\nhappen, who undertakes upright conduct, who surpasses mortality, who respects\nevery creed--this man shall shine as royal saint.\n\n519\n\nHarischandra drawing near in truth, in former time, established himself in\neternal fame. Truth is the chief grace of kings.\n\n520\n\nThe class of half casts are seceders from the family ordinances, a wicked\ntribe; full of robbery and adultery. What more need we say of these cruel\nwretches that are heedless of right and wrong?\n\np. 131\n\n521\n\nThey mention not their own conduct but say _Dharmudu_ (yama) is vainly given\nto anger. They listen not to a word in due season; but talk and chatter\nultimately they shall fall into his burnings.\n\n522\n\nWhen a cataract ( _pora_ ) covers his eyes, a man unable to see, tosses about\n(pora) begging that the cataract might be removed. But surely this is the\nunalterable punishment of his frauds in a former birth.\n\n523\n\nAll men have one excellent dwelling. Beholding this house the heart is afraid\nwhen it is in dread; it (forgets the body) swoons when the body swoons; then\nare we resolved into the great spirit.\n\n524\n\nI will fitly teach all that dwell in the earth; that they may know the city\n(i.e., body) that beholds God is but one. Let not thy mind be corrupt and in\nit shalt thou gloriously behold Him\n\np. 132\n\n525\n\nWith this vile mouth defiled with spittle let us not read the _shastras_ or\n_Veda_. Consider are they not thereby defiled.\n\n526\n\nThe name teacher is very mighty; is not the most chief place attained through\nthe Teacher. Teacher signifies light. To such a teacher let us remain\nattached.\n\n527\n\nWill not the word, 'I', equally suit thee? Surely if you lay aside of the\nfashion of saying thou and I, then shall He thou and thou I.\n\n528\n\nLet those who restrain all their thoughts and attach them-selves to the deity,\nbecome even while householders, recluses and gain heaven. But if like the\n_budama_ fruit they please all men, how shall they be blessed.\n\n529\n\nHim that truly know that God that dwells in the heart shall they call _yogee_\n; if thou know thyself thou art thyself the deity.\n\np. 133\n\n530\n\nWater sinks into the earth; a sprout turns into earth (observe phrase); the\nplant is both husband and son to the earth-(This has [occurred](errata.htm#86)\nelsewhere). The earth is mother and wife of all men.\n\n531\n\nIf thou give food to one who has failed (lost his opportunity), having failed\n(or lost luck) he will be ruined even by that food. When fortune is gone, food\nitself is death. (Simple construction, untranslatable in English).\n\n532\n\nIf a poor wretch void of means and subsistence dies, no one who has means will\ngo near him; will not men who have means go to those have subsistence.\n\n533\n\nWill not the life of the poor end? Will not they roam from place to place?\nThey who will not look towards him who has no support, these are themselves\ndestitute. (puns)\n\n534\n\np. 134\n\nWealth suits well the acts that we participate in it. Power is a tie on us.\n(The power is led on to great oppression). Wealth and power each do us harm.\n(loose version)\n\n535\n\nShall those who while they have wealth labour and toil and in the feast days\n(on happy days) bestow on others what they ask, shall these be called hardmen?\n\n536\n\nThose who are not able to know the everlasting, and who are ignorant of wisdom\nwho know not the truth, murderers, have no fate (course), but this, in the\nfire of hell and in paining hunger shall they...\n\n537\n\nThose ignorant souls that know not that this can be done (avuta) and this not\n(c\xc4\x81mi) ignorant of the truth, daily through impurity produce offspring; unable\nto know the spirit they continue to die and born anew in this world.\n\n538\n\nBodies are transient, virtue is eternal, all the virtue we perform is alone\nthe thing that cannot be ruined. These brutes of men though they see and hear\ncannot understand.\n\np. 135\n\n539\n\nA village void of farmers is a sorrow to the _curnam_. The hatred of the\n_curnam_ is a grief to the farmer. The farmer and the _curnam_ are to each\nother like the buckets (pots) on a yoke.\n\n540\n\nIf on any occasion the curnam scorns the farmers, their dwelling become\nunstable as a paper kite. If the _curnam_ despises the farmer, the _curnam_\nsurely becomes (upakaranam) a mere appendage.\n\n541\n\nIf the [_curnam_](errata.htm#87) conducts himself as the farmers' desire, the\n_curnam_ obtains good property and power. If he despises them, evil shall not\nfail of reaching him, the village being deserted.\n\n542\n\nAll the attainments (learning) of a man in poverty turn to disgrace, even to\nhim that is of celebrity and however great. Shame falls to the share of the\nbase. (who repay it not)\n\n543\n\np. 136\n\nLike as lotuses which if they leave the water fade; the rays of the sun who is\nthe lover of the lotus affecting them; thus if thou leave thy due station it\nis certain that thy friends shall become thy foes.\n\n544\n\nHow many lusts has the belly? For it men are in anxiety. For the sake of the\nbelly, villages exist and so do forests. In someway or other provision is\nalways found for the belly. Surely it governs men.\n\n545\n\nWhat shall become of the hard man who wishing to give gifts or charity says he\nwill give it today or tomorrow and thus procrastinates? What shall become of\nhis life? .He is ignorant of the force of delusion?\n\n546\n\nOur own kin (passions) are foes to us and our own virtues are our nearest\nrelations. He who knows his own thought and that of his foe; this man is\nassured by Siva. (that is who thoroughly knows the good and evil propensities\nof his nature).\n\np. 137\n\n547\n\nIf we consider the conduct of men, surely no one is able to esteem it aright\nno more than we are able to esteem the purple hue of the _pindi_ herb.\n\n548\n\nThe villages (mahals) we possess shall not follow us in death, nor shall our\njewels, our wife, children or friends accompany us. The alms we have bestowed\nshall alone follow us.\n\n549\n\nAll the wealth of _B \xc4\x81channa_ who was born in the Raya caste fell to the lot\nof the Bhatts (poets). But the wealth of the base was shared between his kin\nand the strange woman.\n\n550\n\nManifest in the world was Guntupally Muttadu gifted with noble virtues. By\nmeans of bestowing food and through worship of God, was he absorbed in the\nDeity.\n\n551\n\nBehold the unrighteous who in the severest famine give the mere leavings of\nfood to others; these shall be born again as dogs that lick defiled leaf-\nplatters.\n\np. 138\n\n552\n\nStrange is that a man will embezzle the donations made either by himself or by\nothers. It is like selling a wife and buy a slut instead. (A substitution of\ncrime for virtue.)\n\n553\n\nThe sinner [that](errata.htm#88) interferes with the charities\n[established](errata.htm#89) by himself or others, he shall for many years be\nrepeatedly born in the earth as a worm and suffer misery,\n\n554\n\nSay not he is there or here. Vishnu dwells through all places shining in\nsplendour. Behind him does the serpent follow the course of his _chacra_.\n\n555\n\nHe has given some creatures feathers as a covering, tails to others, clothes\nto some, and leaves to others. Thus has God provided for all,\n\n556\n\np. 139\n\nHe who investigates in water the element (of fire) and ascertains it with\ndelight in his mind--this man is like water of elemental nature. (awfully\ndifficult)\n\n557\n\nA wife unapproved, who does not love you, a friend who desires you not, he\nhateth not these--he is a silly swain.\n\n558\n\nThe state in which it is not disunited from the soul is agreeable to the body.\nBut the state of separation is best for the soul. Therefore if thou obtain\nsuch a state thou shall enjoy its fruits.\n\n559\n\nBehold the world is bound with the seven cords of passions. Strange! with the\nsword of knowledge let us strive to sever them.\n\n560\n\nLet the fool first learn to know the Deity. (I propose reading\n![](img/13900.jpg)). He is himself unable to describe it. But when another\ndies he merely cavils like to a dog that can upset a pile of pots but is it\nable to erect it?\n\n561\n\np. 140\n\nIf thou eat a powdered bar of steel in medicine. it will make thee pure; if\nthou eat a bar of steel, disease will be removed. A bar of steel is thus\nsuperior to the tree of desire.\n\n562\n\nHe who eats steel is the mightiest in the world. He who swallows steel shall\ndwell in the earth. What is superior to steel? nothing but the tree of desire.\n\n563\n\nDistress and sorrow are in proportion to our wealth. By sorrow is the body\nweakened; freedom from anxiety is the only possession secure from ruin.\n\n564\n\nHe that loves the body undertakes to attain corporeal perfection. He who loves\nthe body becomes a lover of God. When he becomes a lover of God, he shall\nattain immortality.\n\n565\n\nThose who know every distinction of soul shall never fall. These are not\nensnared in affection for those who are later born. When water hath become a\npearl, will it again be reduced to water.\n\n566\n\np. 141\n\nSoon shall the sensual ( _d \xc4\x93hi_) wretch who is blinded with attachment to his\nwealth, sons and wife reach utter ruin through his desires--alas! how shall\nthis wretch attain emancipation?\n\n567\n\nFirst born in a bag of skin, if he be wise will learn what happened before his\nbirth. If he cannot learn then he shall perish in his folly.\n\n568\n\nThrough the deceit of the wicked and crafty thus Nay Harm are deceived and\nruined. (Their raft is sunk--a proverb) Evil qualities and evil talkers are\ngrief.\n\n569\n\nWith these eyes how can we behold thee? The eyes that see thee are other and\nthe vision diverse. Let us turn our eyes inwards and behold thee.\n\n570\n\nThe wife that answers again to her husband is a bitch. The husband who\npersists in being coupled with her, these are like a pair of swine that tumble\ntogether into the mud,\n\n571\n\np. 142\n\nA stumpy man is a sorrow and a spotted worm (serpent)is a grief, the longing\nfor interest is a sorrow and the lions provider is a grief. A short leg or arm\nan equal plague.\n\n572\n\nShould a fire billet pride itself on being placed on another? To be on a tree,\nmight indeed make it proud. Yet surely both the stick and the tree were\ncreated by the divinity.\n\n573\n\nSinful gains are the cause of hanging the head--truth is surely the heart\n(ball of the soul), but to know this requires firm wisdom.\n\n574\n\nWhen a crane sees the moon it cries 'Co' and mounts on the summit of the\nbanyan branch on the hill. The fair coloured moon is placed on the head of\nSiva.\n\n575\n\nIf thou art beaten, reviled and bound fast, and with all violence, it shall\nnot go well with thee (tiradu), unless thou refrain from saying thou art\ncruel, and meditate with firm mind on Siva.\n\n576\n\np. 143\n\nThe waters of the firmament doth he hold as a bunch of flowers in his hand in\nnoble beauty. He that hath such surpassing power is the teacher of teachers.\n\n577\n\nWoman is like a box containing a young serpent; if thou put anything in this\nbox and after closing it, thou try to pull it again she springs out as a great\nserpent.\n\n578\n\nThey talk of what they call shame? Where doth it reside? They talk of hunger.\nWhere does it lie? Where they are I suppose.\n\n579\n\nWhen man accepts alms and when he possesses fortune, he is a fool; he suffers\nanxiety in his mind for the body he inhabits.\n\n580\n\nHappiness shall never flourish with him who gives not meal nor drink. He shall\nbe as a widower. Besides, shall the deity dwell with him.\n\n581\n\np. 144\n\nIf thou fasten a stone to a gourd with a rope it will grow elegantly without a\ncurve. But were you to fasten it to a dog's tail, would it become straight?\n\n582\n\nWhat are we to think of the slaughters of these cruel half cast wretches (born\nout of the limits of the caste) who being themselves rationed slay animals\nwithout any offence and guilty and eat them.\n\n583\n\nIf you with displeasure take a meal in the house of a person you dislike then\none thing happens or you gain your end. It is as though you got it not\nevidently to both parties; that food produces hatred.\n\n584\n\nLike water on a lotus leaf (which rolls of and leaves it dry) walked Vemana.\nseeking God. O trust not to this illusion. To this mind, the lord is\nincomprehensible.\n\n585\n\np. 145\n\nO Vemana! thy powers are not yet known even in the least. O Vemana! let us\nknow how great it is thy pleasure to be [hereafter](errata.htm#90) styled.\nThat is, thou alone art all we have; who else is our refuge? (admirable,\nsimple)\n\n586\n\nVemana is like to a man without food, void of anger, in every place at every\n(word i.e.,) moment, also in the form of verse has he spoken decidedly and so\nthat it might be understood by all, in the earth he assumed the form of Siva,\nwho is there who, time after time, is equal to Vemana?\n\n587\n\nWhat does a foul feeder care for excellent food? What does this body care for\nthe light of wisdom? Know this and hereby learn the Vedanta.\n\n588\n\nIf, viewing the _yugas_ of the world as we pass through our transmigrations,\nwe be not entangled there in, but in each yuga we become penitents, suffering\nsorrow and distress, the brilliant glory shall dwell in our soul.\n\n589\n\np. 146\n\nHearing he heareth not, being mad seeing he seeth not, this is _yogee_. He\nreceives homage from the noblest of men.\n\n590\n\nLook on all pleasure. Surely it is sorrow. Our sins are the parents of even\nour virtues. This is as though a robber should wish to be impaled. The\npunishment will befall him unsought.\n\n591\n\nIf you have hold of the root of a tree why go search all over it? If you\npossess the philosopher stone why (grieve) take further trouble regarding the\nvoices of birds that knew where it lies or regarding the caves of the hills\nwhere it is?\n\n592\n\nIf thou think on thy wife and children with great love, if thy desires be\nattached to thy wealth, surely there is no salvation in the world for this\nman.\n\n593\n\nLike as a cuckoo enters the nest of a crow, like as a maggot lives sustained\nby a wasp, such is the ruined teacher, (what sort of teacher) that knows not\nthe truth and salvation.\n\n594\n\np. 147\n\nHow bright is the eye of the lover? It ever gazes on woman. Where is there\nanything like this? if thou look on the image in the eye how small it is?\n\n595\n\nThey will not give to the poor as they will to the chief in the earth. To a\n(Brahmachari) student they will not give as they do to a woman. They will not\ngive for wise what they will for wine (lit. toddy).\n\n596\n\nThey are pleased when they see a village thinking it will be good residence;\nwhen they see the wilderness they are alarmed. He who looks upon forest and\ntown as on; this is the settled and pure saint.\n\n597\n\nHe who lauds the base, and roams and rambles in mendicity gaineth but fatigue.\nBut be is superior who guards the brute senses (lit. sense--cattle) and shall\nshine both in this world and the next.\n\n598\n\np. 146\n\nGod causes us to possess the skill of composing verse. With apt skill and\ncorrectness, Vemana having duly performed (sandhya) draughts, (nishtha)\nmeditation, (homa) oblation, and offering of water (tarpana) to the manes has\nhad the happiness to compose it.\n\n599\n\nHe who desires not any enjoyment, who ceases from loving and dislike, and who\nlooks for the attainment, soon, of beatitude, this is the king of yogees.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 600-699](vov08.htm)\n\n"
