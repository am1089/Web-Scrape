Naraya _n_ a said :-- Even if a man studies the Vedas with six Amgas\n(limbs of the Vedas), he cannot be pure if he be devoid of the principle of\nright living (Sadachara) and if he does not practise it. All that is in vain.\nAs soon as the two wings of the young ones of birds appear they leave their\nnests, so the chhandas (the Vedas) leave such a man devoid of Sadachara at the\ntime of his death. The intelligent man should get up from his bed at the\nBrahma muhurta and should observe all the principles of Sadachara. In the last\nquarter of night, he should practise in reciting and studying the Vedas. Then\nfor some time he should meditate on his I _st_ a Deva (his Presiding Deity).\nThe Yogi should meditate on Brahma according to the method stated before. O\nNarada! If meditation be done as above, the identity of Jiva and Brahma is at\nonce realised and the man becomes liberated while living. After the fifty-\nfifth Da _nd_ a from the preceding sunrise, i.e., 2 hours before the sunrise\ncomes the U _s_ akala; after the fifty seventh Da _nd_ a comes the Aru _n_\nodayakala; after fifty eighth Da _nd_ a comes the morning time; then the Sun\nrises. On should get up from one's bed in the morning time. He should go then\nto a distance where an arrow shot at one stretch goes. There in the south-west\ncorner he is to void his urines and faeces. Then the man, if he be a\nBrahmachari, should place his holy thread on his right ear and the householder\nshould suspend it on his neck only. That is, the Brahmachari, in the first\nstage of of his life should place the holy thread over his right ear; the\nhouseholder and the Vanaprasthis should suspend the holy thread from the neck\ntowards the back and then void their faeces, etc. He is to tie a piece of\ncloth round his head; and spread earth or leaves on the place where he will\nevacuate himself. He is not to talk then nor spit nor inhale hard. One is not\nto evacuate oneself in cultivated lands, that have been tilled, in water, over\nthe burning pyre, on the mountain, in the broken and ruined temples, on the\nant-hills, on places covered with grass, on road side, or on holes where\nliving beings exist. One ought not\n\n\n\np. 1060\n\n\n\nto do the same also while walking. One ought to keep silence during both the\ntwilights, while one is passing urine or voiding one's faeces, or while one is\nholding sexual intercourse, or before the presence of one's Guru, during the\ntime of sacrifice, or while making gifts, or while doing Brahma Yaj\xc3\xb1a. One\nought to pray before evacuating, thus :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! O Ri _s_ is! O Pis'achas!\nO Uragas! O Rak _s_ asas! You all who might be existing here unseen by me, are\nrequested to leave this place. I am going to ease myself here duly.\xc2\x94 Never one\nis to void oneself while one looks at Vayu (wind), Agni (fire), a Brahma _n_\na, the Sun, water or cow. At the day time one is to turn one's face northward\nand at the night time southward, while easing oneself and then one is to cover\nthe faeces, etc., with stones, pebbles, leaves or grass, etc. Then he is to\nhold his genital organ with his hand and go to a river or any other watery\nplace; he is to fill his vessel with water then and go to some other place.\n\n\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a is to use the white earth, the K _s_ attriya is to take the\nred earth, the Vais'ya is to use the yellow earth and the S\xc2\x92udra is to apply\nthe black earth and with that he is to cleanse himself. The earth under water,\nthe earth of any temple, the earth of an anthill, the earth of a mouse hole,\nand the remnant of the earth used by another body for washing are not to be\nused for cleansing purposes. The earth for cleansing faeces is twice as much\nas that used in case of urine clearance; in the cleansing after sexual\nintercourse thrice as much. In urine cleansing the earth is to be applied in\nthe organ of generation once, thrice in the hand. And in dirt clearing, twice\nin the organ of generation, five times in anus, ten times in the left hand and\nseven times in both the hands. Then apply earth four times first in the left\nfeet and then on the right feet. The house holder should clean thus; the\nBrahmachari is to do twice and the Yatis four times. At every time the\nquantity of wet earth that is to be taken is to be of the size of an \xc3\x82malaki\nfruit; never it is to be less than that. This is for the clearance in the day\ntime. Half of these can be used in the night time. For the invalids, one-\nfourth the above measurements; for the passers-by, one-eighth the above\ndimensions are to be observed. In case of women, S\xc2\x92udras, and incapable\nchildren, clearings are to be done till then when the offensive smell\nvanishes. No numbers are to be observed. Bhagavan Manu says for all the Var\n_n_ as the clearing is to be done till then when the offensive smell vanishes.\nThe clearing is to be performed by the left hand. The right hand is never to\nbe used. Below the navel, the left hand is to be used; and above the navel the\nright hand is to be used for clearing. The wise man should never hold his\nwater pot while evacuating himself. If by mistake he catches hold of his\nwaterpot, he will have to perform the penance (praya _s_ chitta).\n\n\n\np. 1061\n\n\n\nIf, out of vanity or sloth, clearing be not done, for three nights, one is to\nfast, drinking water only, and then to repeat the Gayatri Mantra and thus be\npurified. In every matter, in view of the place, time and materials, one's\nability and power are to be considered and steps are to be taken accordingly.\nKnowing all this, one should clear oneself according to rule. Never be lazy\nhere. After evacuating oneself of faeces, one is to rinse one's mouth twelve\ntimes; and after passing urine and clearing, one is to rinse four times. Never\nless than that is to be done. The water after rinsing is to be thrown away\nslowly downwards on one's left. Next performing \xc3\x82chaman one is to wash one's\nteeth. He is to take a tiny piece, twelve \xc3\x82ngulas (fingers) long (about one\nfoot) from a tree which is thorny and gummy. The cleansing twig (for teeth) is\nthick like one's little finger. He is to chew the one end of it to form a\ntooth brush. Karanja, U _d_ umbara (figtree), Mango, Kadamba, Lodha, Champaka\nand Vadari trees are used for cleansing teeth. While cleansing teeth, one is\nto recite the following mantra :-- \xc2\x93O Tree! Wherein resides the Deity Moon for\ngiving food to the beings and for killing the enemies! Let Him wash my mouth\nto increase my fame and honour! O Tree! Dost Thou please give me long life,\npower, fame, energy, beauty, sons, cattle, wealth, intellect, and the\nknowledge of Brahma.\xc2\x94 If the cleansing twig be not available and if there be\nany prohibition to brush one's teeth that day, (say, Pratipad day, Amavas, _S_\na _st_ hi and Navami), take mouthfuls of water, gargle twelve times and thus\ncleanse the teeth. If one brushes one's teeth with a twig on the new moon day,\nthe first, sixth, ninth and eleventh day after the Full or New Moon or on\nSunday, one eats the Sun (is it were, by making Him lose his fire), makes his\nfamily line extinct and brings his seven generations down into the hell. Next\nhe should wash his feet and sip pure clean water thrice, touch his lips twice\nwith his thumb, and then clear the nostrils by his thumb and fore finger. Then\nhe is to touch his eyes and ears with his thumb and ring finger, touch his\nnavel with his thumb and little finger, touch his breast with his palm and\ntouch his head with all his fingers.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Second Chapter of the Eleventh Book on cleansing the several\nparts of the body in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3](bk11ch03.htm)\n\n"
