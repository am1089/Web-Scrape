Whom you protect again and again, O gods, and whom you lead, to him, O\nAgni, Varu _n_ a, Mitra, Aryaman, and Maruts, yield your protection.\n\n2\\. He who sacrifices, O gods, overcomes his enemies by your protection on a\nhappy day. He who gives to your delight, spreads forth his dwelling, spreads\nout much food.\n\n3\\. This Vasish _th_ a will not despise even the last among you, O Maruts;\ndrink [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:3:1) all of you, to-day, at my libation here,\nfull of desire.\n\n4\\. Your help does not indeed fail that man in battle to whom you granted it,\nO men! Your newest favour has turned hither, come quick then, ye who wish to\ndrink.\n\n5\\. O ye whose gifts are cheering, come to drink the (juice of the Soma)\nflowers: these are your libations, O Maruts, for I gave them to you, do not go\nelsewhere!\n\n6\\. Sit down on our altar and protect [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:6:1) us, to give\nus brilliant riches. O Maruts, who never miss the Soma mead, hail to you here\nto enjoy yourselves.\n\n7\\. Having adorned their bodies, the swans with dark blue backs came flying in\nsecret [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:7:1)--the whole flock sat down all around me,\nlike gay men, delighting in the Soma offering.\n\n8\\. O Maruts, that hateful man who beyond our thoughts tries to hurt us, O\nVasus, may he catch the snares of Drub, kill him with your hottest bolt!\n\np. 387\n\n9\\. O you Maruts, full of heat, here is the libation; be pleased to accept it,\nO you who destroy the enemies by your help [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:9:1).\n\n10\\. O you who accept the domestic sacrifices [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:10:1),\ncome hither, O Maruts, do not keep away, you who are bounteous by your help\n[2](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:10:2).\n\n11\\. O Maruts, strong and wise, with sun-bright skins, I choose the sacrifice\nfor you here and there [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:11:1)\n\n12\\. We sacrifice to Tryambaka [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:12:1), the sweet-\nscented, wealth-increasing (Rudra). May I be detached from death, like a gourd\nfrom its stem, but not [2](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:12:2) from the immortal\n[3](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:12:3).\n\np. 388\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Vasish _th_ a. Verse 12 addressed to Rudra.\n\nVerse 3 occurs SV. I, 241; verse 8, AV. VII, 77, 2; TS. IV, 3, 13, 3; MS. IV,\n10, 5; verse 9, AV. VII, 77, 1; TS. IV, 3, 13, 3; MS. IV, 10, 5; verse 10, TS.\nIV, 3, 13, 5; MS. IV, 10, 5; verse 11, T\xc3\x82. I, 4, 3; MS. IV, 10, 3; verse 12,\nVS. III, 60; AV. XIV, 1, 17; TS. I, 8, 6, 2; MS. I, 10, 4; TA. X, 56; _S_ at.\nBr. II, 6, 2, 12.\n\nMetre, 1, 3, 5 B _ri_ hati; 2, 4, 6 Satob _ri_ hati; 7, 8 Trish _t_ ubh; 9,\n10, 11 Gayatri; 12 Anush _t_ ubh.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nWith pada a compare I, 110, 7; with c and d, VIII, 27, 16.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. SV. has pibantu, and as a various reading the comment. gives pivanta.\nSute sa _k_ a is a standing phrase.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. I cannot see how avita can stand for avishta (Delbruck, Verb, 186;\nWhitney, Gram. \xc2\xa7 908). I translate as if the text gave avata.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. On the secret approach of the Maruts, see I, 88, 5.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nThe text in the AV. VII, 77, 2, is bad, yo no marto maruto durh _ri_ _n_ ayus,\nprati mu _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ atam sa _h_ , and tapasa for hanmana. The TS. IV, 3, 13, 3,\nhas tira _h_ satya\xc2\xb4ni. It reads besides, yo no marto vasavo durh _ri_ _n_ ayus\ntira _h_ satya\xc2\xb4ni maruta _h_ _g_ igha _m_ \xcc\x90sat druha _h_ pa\xc2\xb4 _s_ am, and\ntapasa. Tira _h_ _k_ itta\xc2\xb4ni may mean 'beyond all conception,' as Grassmann\ntakes it, or 'unobserved,' as B.-R. suggest. Tira _h_ satya\xc2\xb4ni might mean 'in\nspite of all pledges,' but that is probably an emendation. All this shows the\nunsettled state of Vedic tradition, outside that of the Rig-veda; see\nOldenberg, Prolegomena, p. 328.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x9bti\xc2\xb4, taken here as a dative, by Lanman, p. 382.\n\np. 389\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. On the Maruts g _ri_ hamedhina _h_ , see _S_ at. Br. II, 5, 3, 4.\nPossibly the Maruts may be called g _ri_ hamedhas, i. e. g _ri_ hasthas,\nperforming the G _ri_ hya sacrifices. See on these names TS. I, 8, 4, 1; 2.\n\nNote 2. The last pada in the TS. is pramu _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ anto no a _m_ hasa _h_.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. On iheha, see Delbruck, Syntax, p. 51. It means 'here and there,' that\nis, 'again and again.'\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. Tryambaka is a name of Rudra, but its original meaning is doubtful.\nSome commentators explain it by 'three-eyed,' but its natural meaning would be\n'having three mothers.' The _S_ at. Br. II, 6, 2, 9, derives it from Stry-\nambika, because Ambika, Rudra's sister, shares the sacrifice with him.\n\nNote 2. On ma with optative, see Delbruck, Synt. Forsch. I, 194; Syntax, 338,\n361, Anm. 1.\n\nNote 3. That am _ri_ tat is right, not, as Grassmann suggests, am _ri_ ta, is\nclear from the parallel forms, preto mu _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ami na\xc2\xb4muta _h_ , or ito\nmukshiya ma\xc2\xb4muta _h_. Pischel in Z. D. M. G. XL, 121, demands too much logical\naccuracy from a poet; see AV. XIV, I, 17; VS. III, 60.\n\nAll scholars seem to agree that this hymn is a composite hymn, and that it\nbreaks the law of decrease in the number of verses. It begins with three\nPragathas, verses 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, which may be in their right\nplace. Then follow two Trish _t_ ubhs, 7 and 8, which may form a hymn by\nthemselves. The next three Gayatris, which clearly belong together, are a\nlater addition; so is the last verse, which ought to stand in the Atharva\nrather than in the Rig-veda. The Pada text does not divide this last verse.\nSee on this subject, Oldenberg, Z. D. M. G. XXXVIII, 449 seq., Proleg. 200;\n511; Bergaigne, Recherches sur l'histoire de la Sa _m_ hita, II, 10.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 7. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3250.htm)\n\n"
