THE VAI _S_ VADEVA.\n\nThe three seasonal or four-monthly sacrifices are performed at the parvans, or\ncommencement of the three seasons (spring, rainy\n\np. 384\n\nseason, and autumn), viz. the Vai _s_ vadeva generally on the full moon of\nPhalguna; the Varu _n_ apraghasa _h_ on that of \xc3\x82sha _dh_ a; and the Sakamedha\n_h_ on that of Karttika. As a fourth _K_ aturmasya, ritual authorities add the\n_S_ unasiriya, though they are at variance as to the exact time of its\nperformance; and neither is its true significance clearly indicated. It\napparently marks merely the conclusion of the seasonal offerings (which, as a\nrule, are only performed once, cf. II, 6, 3, 12 seq.); but while the author of\nthe _S_ atapatha allows it to be performed at any time (within four months)\nafter the Sakamedha _h_ , other ritualists hold that its performance should\ntake place on the fifth full moon after the Sakamedha _h_ , or, in other\nwords, exactly a year after the Vai _s_ vadeva. See Weber, Nakshatra, II, p.\n334 seq.\n\n2:5:1:11\\. Verily, in the beginning, Pra _g_ apati alone existed here 1. He\nthought within himself, 'How can I be propagated?' He toiled and practised\nausterities. He created living beings 2. The living beings created by him\npassed away: they are those birds. Now man is the nearest to Pra _g_ apati;\nand man is two-footed: hence birds are two-footed.\n\n2:5:1:22\\. Pra _g_ apati thought within himself, 'Even as formerly I was\nalone, so also am I now alone.' He created a second (race of beings); they\nalso passed away: they are those small crawling reptiles other than snakes. He\ncreated a third (race), they say; they also passed away: they are those\nsnakes. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, on his part, declared them to be of two kinds\nonly; but of three kinds they are according to the _Ri_ k.\n\n2:5:1:33\\. While praising and practising austerities, Pra _g_ apati\n\np. 385\n\nthought within himself, 'How comes it that the living beings created by me\npass away?' He then became aware that his creatures passed away from want of\nfood. He made the breasts in the fore-part of (their) body 1 teem with milk.\nHe then created living beings; and by resorting to the breasts, the beings\ncreated by him thenceforward continued to exist: they are these (creatures)\nwhich have not passed away.\n\n2:5:1:44\\. Hence it has been said by the _Ri_ shi 2,.--'Three generations have\npassed beyond,'--this is said [regarding](errata.htm#9) those that passed\naway;--'Others settled down around the light (arka, the sun)'--the light\ndoubtless is the fire: those creatures which did not pass away, settled down\naround the fire; it is with regard to them that this is said.\n\n2:5:1:55\\. 'The great one (neut.) 3 remained within the worlds'--it is with\nregard to Pra _g_ apati that this is said.--'The blower (or, purifier) entered\nthe regions'--the regions doubtless are the quarters, and these were indeed\nentered by that blowing wind: it is with regard to them that this verse was\nuttered. And in like manner as Pra _g_ apati created these living beings, so\nthey are propagated: for whenever the breasts of woman and the udder of cattle\nswell, then whatever is born is born; and by resorting to the breasts these\n(beings) continue to exist.\n\n2:5:1:66\\. Now that milk is indeed food; for in the beginning Pra _g_ apati\nproduced it for food. But that\n\np. 386\n\nfood also means living beings (progeny), since it is by food that they exist:\nby resorting to the breasts of those who have milk, they continue to exist.\nAnd those who have no milk are nursed by the former as soon as they are born;\nand thus they exist by means of food, and hence food means progeny.\n\n2:5:1:77\\. He who is desirous of offspring, sacrifices with that oblation, and\nthereby makes himself the sacrifice, which is Pra _g_ apati 1.\n\n2:5:1:88\\. In the first place 2 there is a cake for Agni on eight potsherds.\nAgni indeed is the root, the progenitor of the deities; he is Pra _g_ apati\n('lord of creatures'): hence there is a cake for Agni.\n\n2:5:1:99\\. Then follows a potful of boiled rice ( _k_ aru) for Soma. Soma\ndoubtless is seed, and that in Agni, the progenitor; he (Agni) casts the seed\nSoma: thus there is at the outset a productive union.\n\n2:5:1:1010\\. Then follows a cake on twelve or eight potsherds 3 for Savit\n_ri_. Savit _ri_ indeed is the impeller (pra-savit _ri_ ) of the gods; he is\nPra _g_ apati, the intermediate 4 progenitor: hence the cake to Savit _ri_.\n\n2:5:1:1111\\. Then follows a potful of boiled rice for Sarasvati; and another\nfor Pushan. Sarasvati doubtless is a woman, and Pushan is a man: thus there is\nagain a productive union. Through that twofold productive union Pra _g_ apati\ncreated the living beings,--\n\np. 387\n\nthrough the one (he created) the upright, and through the other those looking\nto the ground. This is why there are these five oblations 1.\n\n2:5:1:1212\\. After that (follows), as a foundation for the curds, a cake on\nseven potsherds for the Maruts. The Maruts indeed are the people (vi _s_ a _h_\n), the people of the gods. They roamed about here entirely unimpeded. Having\napproached Pra _g_ apati, when he was sacrificing, they said, 'We shall\ndestroy those creatures of thine which thou art about to create by means of\nthis offering 2.'\n\n2:5:1:1313\\. Pra _g_ apati reflected, 'My former creatures have passed away;\nand if those (Maruts) destroy these (creatures), then nothing will be left.'\nHe accordingly set aside for them that share, the Maruts' cake on seven\npotsherds; and that is this same cake on seven potsherds for the Maruts. The\nreason why it is one of seven potsherds, is that the host of the Maruts is\n(distributed in troops) of seven each 3. This is why there is a cake on seven\npotsherds for the Maruts.\n\n2:5:1:1414\\. Let him offer it to the 'self-strong' (Maruts); since they gained\nthat share for themselves. [If], however, they (the priests) do not find an\ninvitatory and an offering prayer (addressed) to the 'self-strong' (Maruts) 4,\nlet it be (offered) simply to the\n\np. 388\n\n[paragraph continues] Maruts. It is offered for the safety of creatures: hence\nit is offered to the Maruts.\n\n2:5:1:1515\\. Thereupon follows the oblation of curds (payasya). Now it is on\nmilk that the creatures subsist, it was by means of milk that they were\npreserved: hence he now offers to them that by which they were preserved, and\nwhereon they subsist; and the beings whom he creates by means of the foregoing\nofferings, subsist on that milk, on that oblation of curds.\n\n2:5:1:1616\\. Therein a union takes place: the curdled milk (payasya, fem.) is\nfemale, and the whey is seed. From that union the infinite All was gradually\ngenerated; and since the infinite All was gradually generated from that union,\ntherefore it (the offering of curds) belongs to the All-gods.\n\n2:5:1:1717\\. Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Heaven and Earth. Now\nwhen Pra _g_ apati had created the living beings by those offerings, he\nenclosed them within heaven and earth; and so they are now enclosed within\nheaven and earth. And in like manner he, who by means of those oblations\ncreates living beings, thereby encloses them within heaven and earth: this is\nwhy there is a cake on one potsherd for Heaven and Earth.\n\n2:5:1:1818\\. Now as to the course of proceeding. They do not raise an uttara-\nvedi 1 in order that it (the sacred work) may be unobstructed, that it may be\nentire, that it may be (worthy) of the All-gods.--The barhis is tied up in\nthree (bunches), and then\n\np. 389\n\nagain in one 1; for such is the characteristic form of generation, since\nfather and mother are a productive (pair), and what is born forms a third\nelement: hence that which is threefold is again (made) one. Thereto flowering\nshoots (of sacrificial grass) are tied: these he uses for the prastara 2; for\nthis is a productive union, and productive indeed are flowering shoots: this\nis why he takes flowering shoots for the prastara.\n\n2:5:1:1919\\. On putting the, sacrificial dishes in their place, they churn the\nfire 3. For it was after Agni was born that Pra _g_ apati's offspring was\nborn;. and so for this (sacrificer) also offspring is born after Agni (the\nfire) has been produced: this is why they churn the fire, after they have\ndeposited the sacrificial dishes in their place.\n\np. 390\n\n2:5:1:2020\\. [At the Vai _s_ vadeva-offering] there are nine fore-offerings\nand nine after-offerings 1. Now the vira _g_ metre consists of ten syllables:\nhence, he obtains both times an inferior (incomplete) vira _g_ for the sake of\nproduction, because it was from that inferior (lower) source of production 2\nthat Pra _g_ apati twice produced creatures--both the upright and those\nlooking to the ground. This is why (the Vai _s_ vadeva) has nine fore-\nofferings and nine after-offerings.\n\n2:5:1:2121\\. There are three Samish _t_ aya _g_ us 3; for this (offering) is\ndecidedly greater than an (ordinary) havir-ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a 4, since it has nine\nfore-offerings and nine after-offerings. However, there may also be only a\nsingle Samish _t_ aya _g_ us, since this is a havir-ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a. The priest's\nfee for it (consists of) the firstborn calf (of the season).\n\n2:5:1:2222\\. And what race, what prosperity accrued to Pra _g_ apati from his\noffering this sacrifice, that same race he produces, that same prosperity he\nattains\n\np. 391\n\nwhosoever, knowing this, offers this sacrifice: let him therefore perform this\nsacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[384:1](sbe1256.htm#fr_860) Or, Pra _g_ apati alone was this (universe).

Or, Pra _g_ apati, the real, the existent, 'Pra\n_g_ apatim bhutam.'\n\n[386:2](sbe1256.htm#fr_866) Instead of the preliminary Anvarambha _n_ iya-ish\n_t_ i (see [p. 7](sbe1203.htm#page_7)), a special ish _t_ i may be performed\non this occasion, with a cake on twelve potsherds to Agni Vai _s_ vanara, and\na potful of boiled rice (hare) to Par _g_ anya, for oblations. Katy. V, 1,\n2-4.\n\n[386:3](sbe1256.htm#fr_867) According to Taitt. S. I, 8, 2, it is one on\ntwelve potsherds.\n\n[386:4](sbe1256.htm#fr_868) Madhyata _h_ , lit. 'from the middle.'\n\n[387:1](sbe1256.htm#fr_869) While the five preceding oblations are common to\nall the seasonal offerings (Katy. V, I, 15), the succeeding ones are peculiar\nto the Vai _s_ vadeva.\n\n[387:2](sbe1256.htm#fr_870) The Ka _n_ va text adds, 'if thou wilt not assign\na share to us.'\n\n[387:3](sbe1256.htm#fr_871) In Rig-veda VIII, 96, 8, the Maruts are said to be\nsixty-three in number, divided into nine troops of seven each.\n\n[387:4](sbe1256.htm#fr_872) The Ka _n_ va text has: Tad uta ya _g_ yanuvakye\nsvatavatyau na vindanti; yadi ya _g_ yanuvakye svatavatyau na vinded api\nmarutyav eva syatam.\n\n[388:1](sbe1256.htm#fr_873) The uttara-vedi, or northern (or upper) altar, is\nnot required at the performance of the Vai _s_ vadeva, but at that of the Varu\n_n_ apraghasa _h_ ; see II, 5, 2, 5 seq.\n\n[389:1](sbe1256.htm#fr_874) Three bunches of sacrificial grass are tied\ntogether with one band. Katy. V, 1, 25.\n\n[389:2](sbe1256.htm#fr_875) For the prastara, or bunch of grass representing\nthe sacrificer, see I, 3, 3, 5 seq.; I, 8, 3, II seq.\n\n[389:3](sbe1256.htm#fr_876) Katy. V, I, 27 seq. supplies the following\ndetails:--With the text (Va _g_. V, 2 a, &c.), 'Agni's birth-place art thou,'\nthe Adhvaryu takes up a piece of wood and puts it on the altar. With 'the two\ntesticles are ye' he lays on it two stalks of sacrificial grass. With 'Urva\n_s_ i thou art' he places the lower ara _n_ i (see [p.\n294](sbe1243.htm#page_294), note [3](sbe1243.htm#fn_678)) thereon. With '\xc3\x82yus\n(old age, or the son of Pururavas and Urva _s_ i) thou art' he touches the\nbutter in the pot with the upper ara _n_ i; and with 'Pururavas thou art' he\nputs it down on the lower ara _n_ i. He then calls on the Hot _ri_ to recite\n'to the fire being churned out.' With the three formulas 'with the gayatri\n(trish _t_ ubh, _g_ agati) metre I churn thee!' he churns thrice from left to\nright, and then alternately both ways until fire is produced. He then calls on\nthe Hot _ri_ to recite 'to the born fire' (Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kh. III. 13, 21); and in\ncarrying the fire towards the \xc3\x82havaniya he makes him recite 'to (the fire)\nbeing carried forward.' With the text V, 3, he throws it down on the \xc3\x82havaniya\nhearth; and (having put a kindling-stick on it) he makes two libations of\nbutter thereon with V, 4.\n\n[390:1](sbe1256.htm#fr_877) The same number of praya _g_ as and anuya _g_ as\nare prescribed for the Varu _n_ apraghasa _h_ (see II, 5, 2, 30 and 41, with\nnotes) and for the Mahahavis of the Sakamedha _h_. Katy. V, 2, 8.\n\n[390:2](sbe1256.htm#fr_878) Or rather, from that productive nyuna (womb, lit.\ndefective, lower); see II, 1, 1, 13.\n\n[390:3](sbe1256.htm#fr_879) See I, 9, 2, 25 seq. The formula used, if there be\nonly one Samish _t_ aya _g_ us, is the same as at the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa,\nviz. II, 21 b (VIII, 21). If there are three, they are offered to the wind\n(vata), the sacrifice, and the lord of sacrifice respectively; the formulas Va\n_g_. S. VIII, 22 a b being used with the second and third. Katy. V, 2, 9. For\nthe Varu _n_ apraghasa _h_ and Sakamedha _h_ three Samish _t_ aya _g_ us are\nprescribed, and for the _S_ unasiriya only one.\n\n[390:4](sbe1256.htm#fr_880) Viz. such as the new and full-moon sacrifice,\nwhich serves as the model sacrifice, and at which there are only five fore-\nofferings and three after-offerings.
