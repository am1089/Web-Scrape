Vai _s_ vanara (is the highest Self), on account of the distinctions\nqualifying the common term.\n\nThe _Kh_ andogas read in their text, 'You know at present that Vai _s_ vanara\nSelf, tell us that,' &c., and further on, 'But he who meditates on the Vai _s_\nvanara Self as a span long,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. V, 11, 6; 18, 1). The doubt here\narises whether that Vai _s_ vanara Self can be made out to be the highest Self\nor not. The Purvapakshin maintains the latter alternative. For, he says, the\nword Vai _s_ vanara is used in the sacred texts in four different senses. It\ndenotes in the first place the intestinal fire, so in B _ri_. Up, V, 9, 'That\nis the Vai _s_ vanara fire by which the food that is eaten is cooked, i.e.\ndigested. Its noise is that which one hears when one covers one's ears. When\nman is on the point of departing this life he does not hear that noise.'--It\nnext denotes the third of the elements, so in _Ri_. Sa _m_ h. X, 88, 12, 'For\nthe whole world the gods\n\np. 288\n\nhave made the Agni Vai _s_ vanara a sign of the days.'--It also denotes a\ndivinity, so _Ri_. Sa _m_ h. I, 98, 1, 'May we be in the favour of Vai _s_\nvanara, for he is the king of the kings,' &c. And finally it denotes the\nhighest Self, as in the passage, 'He offered it in the Self, in the heart, in\nAgni Vai _s_ vanara'; and in Pra. Up. I, 7, 'Thus he rises as Vai _s_ vanara,\nassuming all forms, as breath of life, as fire.'--And the characteristic marks\nmentioned in the introductory clauses of the _Kh_ andogya-text under\ndiscussion admit of interpretations agreeing with every one of these meanings\nof the word Vai _s_ vanara.\n\nAgainst this prima facie view the Sutra declares itself. The term 'Vai _s_\nvanara' in the _Kh_ andogya-text denotes the highest Self, because the\n'common' term is there qualified by attributes specially belonging to the\nhighest Self. For the passage tells us how Aupamanyava and four other great\n_Rh_ shis, having met and discussed the question as to what was their Self and\nBrahman, come to the conclusion to go to Uddalaka because he is reputed to\nknow the Vai _s_ vanara Self. Uddalaka, recognising their anxiety to know the\nVai _s_ vanara Self, and deeming himself not to be fully informed on this\npoint, refers them to A _s_ vapati Kaikeya as thoroughly knowing the Vai _s_\nvanara Self; and they thereupon, together with Uddalaka, approach A _s_\nvapati. The king duly honours them with presents, and as they appear unwilling\nto receive them, explains that they may suitably do so, he himself being\nengaged in the performance of a religious vow; and at the same time instructs\nthem that even men knowing Brahman must avoid what is forbidden and do what is\nprescribed. When thereupon he adds that he will give them as much wealth as to\nthe priests engaged in his sacrifice, they, desirous of Release and of knowing\nthe Vai _s_ anara Self, request him to explain that Self to them. Now it\nclearly appears that as the _Ri_ shis are said to be desirous of knowing--that\nBrahman which is the Self of the individual souls ('what is our Self, what is\nBrahman'), and therefore search for some one to instruct them on that point,\nthe Vai _s_ vanara Self--to a person acquainted with which they address\nthemselves--\n\np. 289\n\ncan be the highest Self only. In the earlier clauses the terms used are 'Self\nand 'Brahman,' in the later 'Self' and 'Vai _s_ vanara'; from this it appears\nalso that the term 'Vai _s_ vanara,' which takes the place of 'Brahman,'\ndenotes none other but the highest Self. The results, moreover, of the\nknowledge of the Vai _s_ vanara Self, which are stated in subsequent passages,\nshow that the Vai _s_ vanara Self is the highest Brahman. 'He eats food in all\nworlds, in all beings, in all Selfs'; 'as the fibres of the Ishika reed when\nthrown into the fire are burnt, thus all his sins are burned' (V, 18, I; 24,\n3).\n\nThe next Sutra supplies a further reason for the same conclusion.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 26.
