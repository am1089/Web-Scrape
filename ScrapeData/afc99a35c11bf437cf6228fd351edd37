 \nNo ill upon thy bosom weighs.  \nNo thoughts of joy thy spirit raise.  \nApproved art thou of sages old,  \nTo whom thy doubts are ever told.  \nAlike in death and life, to thee  \nThe same to be and not to be.  \nThe man who such a soul can gain  \nCan ne'er be crushed by woe or pain.  \nPure as the Gods, high-minded, wise,  \nConcealed from thee no secret lies.  \nSuch glorious gifts are all thine own,  \nAnd birth and death to thee are known,  \nThat ill can ne'er thy soul depress  \nWith all-subduing bitterness.  \nO let my prayer, dear brother, win  \nThy pardon for my mother's sin.  \nWrought for my sake who willed it not  \nWhen absent in a distant spot.  \n\nDuty alone with binding chains  \nThe vengeancs due to crime restrains,  \nOr on the sinner I should lift  \nMy hand in retribution swift.  \nCan I who know the right, and spring  \nFrom Das'aratha, purest king--  \nCan I commit a heinous crime,  \nAbhorred by all through endless time?  \nThe aged king I dare not blame,  \nWho died so rich in holy fame,  \nMy honoured sire, my parted lord,  \nE'en as a present God adored.  \nYet who in lore of duty skilled  \nSo foul a crime has ever willed,  \nAnd dared defy both gain and right  \nTo gratify a woman's spite?  \nWhen death draws near, so people say,  \nThe sense af creatures dies away;  \nAnd he has proved the ancient saw  \nBy acting thus in spite of law.  \nBut O my honoured lord, be kind.  \nDismiss the trespass from thy mind,  \nThe sin the king committed, led  \nBy haste, his consort's wrath, and dread.  \nFor he who veils his sire's offence  \nWith tender care and reverence--  \nHis sons approved by all shall live:  \nNot so their fate who ne'er forgive.  \nBe thou, my lord, the noble son,  \nAnd the vile deed my sire has done,  \nAbhorred by all the virtuous, ne'er  \nResent, lest thou the guilt too share.  \nPreserve us, for on thee we call.  \nOur sire, Kaikeyi, me and all  \nThy citizens, thy kith and kin;  \nPreserve us and reverse the sin.  \nTo live in woods a devotee  \nCan scarce with royal tasks agree,  \nNor can the hermit's matted hair  \nSuit fitly with a ruler's care.  \nDo not, my brother, do not still  \nPursue this life that suits thee ill.  \nMid duties, of a king we count  \nHis consecration paramount,  \nThat he with ready heart and hand  \nMay keep his people and his land.  \nWhat Warrior born to royal sway  \nFrom certain good would turn away,  \nA doubtful duty to pursue,  \nThat mocks him with the distant view?  \nThou wouldst to duty cleave, and gain  \nThe meed that follows toil and pain.  \nIn thy great task no labour spare:  \nRule the four castes with justest care.  \nMid all the four, the wise prefer  \nThe order of the householder: 1  \n\np. 216  \n\nCanst thou, whose thoughts to duty cleave,  \nThe best of all the orders leave?  \nMy better thou in lore divine,  \nMy birth, my sense must yield to thine:  \nWhile thou, my lord, art here to reign,  \nHow shall my hands the rule maintain?  \nO faithful lover of the right,  \nTake with thy friends the royal might,  \nLet thy sires' realm, from trouble free,  \nObey her rightful king in thee.  \nHere let the priests and lords of state  \nOur monatch duly consecrate,  \nWith prayer and holy verses blessed  \nBy saint Vas'ishtha and the rest.  \nAnointed king by us, again  \nSeek fair Ayodhva there to reign,  \nAnd like imperial Indra girt  \nBy Gods of Storm, thy might assert.  \nFrom the three debts 1 acquittance earn,  \nAnd with thy wrath the wicked burn,  \nO'er all of us thy rule extend,  \nAnd cheer with boons each faithful friend.  \nLet thine enthronement, lord, this day  \nMake all thy lovers glad and gay,  \nAnd let all those who hate thee flee  \nTo the ten winds for fear of thee.  \nDear lord, my mother's words of hate  \nWith thy sweet virtues expiate,  \nAnd from the stain of folly clear  \nThe father whom we both revere.  \nBrother, to me compassion show,  \nI pray thee with my head bent low,  \nAnd to these friends who on thee call,--  \nAs the Great Father pities all.  \nBut if my tears and prayers be vain,  \nAnd thou in woods wilt still remain,  \nI will with thee my path pursue  \nAnd make my home in forests too.'  \n   Thus Bharat strove to bend his will  \n   With suppliant head, but he,  \nEarth's lord, inexorable still  \n   Would keep his sire's decree.  \nThe firmness of the noble chief  \n   The wondering people moved,  \nAnd rapture mingling with their grief,  \n   All wept and all approved.  \n'How firm his steadfast will,' they cried,  \n  'Who Keeps his promise thus!  \nAh, to Ayodhya's town,' they sighed,  \n  'He comes not back with us'  \nThe holy priest, the swains who tilled  \n  The earth, the sons of trade,  \nAnd e'en the mournful queens were filled  \n  With joy as Bharat prayed,  \nAnd bent their heads, then weeping stilled  \n  A while, his prayer to aid.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[215:1](ry184.htm#fr_383) The four religious orders, referable to different\ntimes of life are, that of the student, that of the householder, that of the\nanchourite, and that of the mendicant.\n\n[216:1](ry184.htm#fr_384) To Gods, Men, and Manes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto CVII.: Rama's Speech.](ry185.htm)\n\n"
