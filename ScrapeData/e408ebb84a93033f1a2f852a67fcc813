Explain this to\nme, that the doubts of my mind may depart." Shree Shookdeo said,--Raja! the\nbird, upon which Huri rides, dwells in the island of Kounuck, it is very\npowerful; for this reason the great serpents in that quarter acknowledging his\nsuperiority, constantly gave him a snake. They brought it, and placed it upon\na tree: he came and devoured it. One day Kalee, the son of the serpent Kudroo,\npresuming on his poison, went and ate up the food of Vishnu\'s bird. In the\nmeantime, the bird came there, and there was a great deal of fighting between\nthe two. Of a sudden Kalee having given up all for lost, began to say to\nhimself, "How shall I escape from him, and where shall I go?" Having thus\nsaid, he thought that if he were to go and dwell at Brindabun on the banks of\nthe Jumna, he would escape, because the bird could not go there; thinking\nthus, Kalee proceeded there. Again the Raja Pureechit enquired from Shookdeo,\n"O great king! explain to me, why he could not go there." Shookdeo Jee said,--\nRaja! once on a time Suobhis, the sage, seated on the bank of\n\np. 66\n\nthe Jumna, was engaged in devotion: the bird of Vishnu, having gone there,\nkilled and ate a fish. Then the sage, being angry, pronounced this curse upon\nhim, "If you ever come here again, you shall not escape with life." For this\nreason, the bird could not go there; and from the time Kalee went to that\nplace, it was called the whirlpool of Kalee. Having recited thus much, Shree\nShookdeo Jee said, when Shree Krishnu Chund came out of the water Nund and\nJusodha being rejoiced, gave many gifts, and performed many acts of charity.\nTheir eyes were delighted at beholding the countenance of their son, and (by\nbeholding) life was restored to all the inhabitants of Bruj. In the evening\nthey said to each other, "How shall we go home now, having suffered fatigue,\nhunger and thirst all day long? Let us pass the night here, and go to\nBrindabun in the morning." Having thus said, they all fell asleep.\n\nAt midnight there was a heavy storm, and a conflagration on all sides. Trees,\nforests and cattle were all destroyed by the fire.\n\nWhen the fire occurred, they all started from sleep, and being frightened, and\nlooking round on all sides, they began to stretch out their hands, and call\nout--"Krishnu! Krishnu! save us quickly from this fire; or it will reduce us\nall to ashes in an instant." When the inhabitants of Bruj, together with Nund\nand Jusodha, had called out thus, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee rising, drank up the\nfire in a moment, and put an end to all their anxiety. They returned to\nBrindabun early in the morning, and there were rejoicings and songs of\ncongratulation in every house.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIX](psa20.htm)\n\n'
