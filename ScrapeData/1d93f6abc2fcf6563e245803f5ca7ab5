I fear, lest borne away  \nBy frenzy of success, she slay  \nKaus'alya, through her wicked hate  \nOf me, bereft, disconsolate;  \nOr her who aye for me has striven  \nSumitra, to devotion given.  \nHence, Lakshman, to Avodhya speed,  \nReturning in the hour of need.  \nWith Sita I my steps will bend  \nWhere Dandak's mighty woods extend.  \nNo guardian has Kaus'alya now:  \nO, be her friend and guardian thou.  \nStrong hate may vile Kaikeyi lead  \nTo many a base unrighteous deed,  \nTreading my mother 'neath her feet  \nWhen Bharat holds the royal seat.  \nSure in some antenatal time  \nWere children, by Kausalya's crime.  \nTorn from their mothers' arms away,  \nAnd hence she mourns this evil day.  \nShe for her child no toil would spare  \nTending me long with pain and care;  \nNow in the hour of fruitage she  \nHas lost that son, ah, woe is me.  \nO Lakshman, may no matron e'er  \nA son so doomed to sorrow bear  \nAs I, my mother's heart who rend  \nWith anguish that can never end.  \nThe Sarika,  1 methinks, possessed  \nMore love than glows in Rama's breast.  \nWho, as the tale is told to us.  \nAddressed the stricken parrot thus:  \n\np. 158  \n\n'Parrot, the capturer's talons tear,  \nWhile yet alone thou flutterest there.  \nBefore his mouth has closed on me:'  \nSo cried the bird, herself to free.  \nReft of her son, in childless woe,  \nMy mother's tears for ever flow:  \nIll-fated, doomed with grief to strive.  \nWhat aid can she from me derive?  \nPressed down by care, she cannot rise  \nFrom sorrow's flood wherein she lies.  \nIn righteous wrath my single arm  \nCould, with my bow, protect from harm  \nAyodhya's town and all the earth:  \nBut what is hero prowess worth?  \nLest breaking duty's law I sin,  \nAnd lose the heaven I strive to win,  \nThe forest life today I choose,  \nAnd kingly state and power refuse.'  \n\nThus mourning in that lonely spot  \nThe troubled chief bewailed his lot,  \nAnd filled with tears, his eyes ran o'er;  \nThen silent sat, and spake no more.  \nTo him, when ceased his loud lament,  \nLike fire whose brilliant might is spent.  \nOr the great sea when sleeps the wave,  \nThus Lakshman consolation gave:  \n'Chief of the brave who bear the bow,  \nE'en now Ayodhya, sunk in woe,  \nBy thy departure reft of light  \nIs gloomy as the moonless night.  \nUnfit it seems that thou, O chief.  \nShouldst so afflict thy soul with grief,  \nSo with thou Sita's heart consign  \nTo deep despair as well as mine.  \nNot I, O Raghu's son, nor she  \nCould live one hour deprived of thee:  \nWe were, without thine arm to save,  \nLike fish deserted by the wave.  \nAlthough my mother dear to meet,  \nS'atrughna and the king, were sweet,  \nOn them, or heaven, to feed mine eye  \nWere nothing, if thou wert not by.'  \n\nSitting at ease, their glances fell  \nUpon the beds, constructed well.  \nAnd there the sons of virtue laid  \nTheir limps beneath the fig tree's shade.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[157:1](ry131.htm#fr_325) The _Main a_ or Gracula religiosa, a favourite cage-\nbird, easily taught to talk.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LIV.: Bharadvaja's Hermitage.](ry132.htm)\n\n"
