Then Uddalaka \xc3\x82runi 2 asked. \'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,\' he said, \'we dwelt\namong the Madras in the houses of Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala Kapya, studying the\nsacrifice. His wife was possessed of a Gandharva, and we asked him: "Who art\nthou?" He answered: "I am Kabandha \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a." And he said to Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\nala Kapya and to (us) students: "Dost thou know, Kapya, that thread by which\nthis world and the other world, and all beings are strung together?" And Pata\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala Kapya replied: "I do not know it, Sir." He said again to Pata _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ ala Kapya and to (us) students: "Dost thou know, Kapya, that puller\n(ruler) within (antaryamin), who within pulls (rules) this world and the other\nworld and all beings?" And Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala Kapya replied: "I do not know it,\nSir." He said again to Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala Kapya and to (us) students: "He, O\nKapya, who knows that thread and him who pulls (it) within, he knows Brahman,\nhe knows the worlds, he knows the Devas, he knows the Vedas, he knows the\nBhutas (creatures), he knows the Self, he knows everything." Thus did he (the\nGandharva) say to them, and I know it. If thou, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, without\nknowing that string and the puller within, drivest away those Brahma-cows (the\ncows offered as a prize to him who best knows Brahman), thy head will fall\noff.\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'O Gautama, I believe I know that thread and the\npuller within.\'\n\np. 133\n\nThe other said: \'Anybody may say, I know, I know. Tell what thou knowest.\'\n\n2\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'Vayu (air) is that thread, O Gautama. By air, as\nby a thread, O Gautama, this world and the other world, and all creatures are\nstrung together. Therefore, O Gautama, people say of a dead person that his\nlimbs have become unstrung; for by air, as by a thread, O Gautama, they were\nstrung together.\'\n\nThe other said: \'So it is, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya. Tell now (who is) the puller\nwithin.\'\n\n3\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'He who dwells in the earth, and within the earth\n1, whom the earth does not know, whose body the earth is, and who pulls\n(rules) the earth within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the\nimmortal.\'\n\n4\\. \'He who dwells in the water, and within the water, whom the water does not\nknow, whose body the water is, and who pulls (rules) the water within, he is\nthy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n5\\. \'He who dwells in the fire, and within the fire, whom the fire does not\nknow, whose body the fire is, and who pulls (rules) the fire within, he is thy\nSelf, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n6\\. \'He who dwells in the sky, and within the sky, whom the sky does not know,\nwhose body the sky is, and who pulls (rules) the sky within, he is thy Self,\nthe puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n7\\. \'He who dwells in the air (vayu), and within the air, whom the air does\nnot know, whose body the\n\np. 134\n\nair is, and who pulls (rules) the air within, he is thy Self, the puller\n(ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n8\\. \'He who dwells in the heaven (dyu), and within the heaven, whom the heaven\ndoes not know, whose body the heaven is, and who pulls (rules) the heaven\nwithin, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n9\\. \'He who dwells in the sun (\xc3\x82ditya), and within the sun, whom the sun does\nnot know, whose body the sun is, and who pulls (rules) the sun within, he is\nthy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n10\\. \'He who dwells in the space (disah), and within the space, whom the space\ndoes not know, whose body the space is, and who pulls (rules) the space\nwithin, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n11\\. \'He who dwells in the moon and stars ( _k_ andra-tarakam), and within the\nmoon and stars, whom the moon and stars do not know, whose body the moon and\nstars are, and who pulls (rules) the moon and stars within, he is thy Self,\nthe puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n12\\. \'He who dwells in the ether (akasa), and within the ether, whom the ether\ndoes not know, whose body the ether is, and who pulls (rules) the ether\nwithin, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n13\\. \'He who dwells in the darkness (tamas), and within the darkness, whom the\ndarkness does not know, whose body the darkness is, and who pulls (rules) the\ndarkness within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n14\\. \'He who dwells in the light (te _g_ as), and within the light, whom the\nlight does not know, whose\n\np. 135\n\nbody the light is, and who pulls (rules) the light within, he is thy Self, the\npuller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\nSo far with respect to the gods (adhidaivatam); now with respect to beings\n(adhibhutam).\n\n15\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'He who dwells in all beings, and within all\nbeings, whom all beings do not know, whose body all beings are, and who pulls\n(rules) all beings within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the\nimmortal.\'\n\n16\\. \'He who dwells in the breath (pra _n_ a), and within the breath, whom the\nbreath does not know, whose body the breath is, and who pulls (rules) the\nbreath within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n17\\. \'He who dwells in the tongue (va _k_ ), and within the tongue, whom the\ntongue does not know, whose body the tongue is, and who pulls (rules) the\ntongue within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n18\\. \'He who dwells in the eye, and within the eye, whom the eye does not\nknow, whose body the eye is, and who pulls (rules) the eye within, he is thy\nSelf, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n19\\. \'He who dwells in the ear, and within the ear, whom the ear does not\nknow, whose body the ear is, and who pulls (rules) the ear within, he is thy\nSelf, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n20\\. \'He who dwells in the mind, and within the mind, whom the mind does not\nknow, whose body the mind is, and who pulls (rules) the mind within, he is thy\nSelf, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n21\\. \'He who dwells in the skin, and within the skin, whom the skin does not\nknow, whose body the\n\np. 136\n\nskin is, and who pulls (rules) the skin within, he is thy Self, the puller\n(ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n22\\. \'He who dwells in knowledge 1, and within knowledge, whom knowledge does\nnot know, whose body knowledge is, and who pulls (rules) knowledge within, he\nis thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.\'\n\n23\\. \'He who dwells in the seed, and within the seed, whom the seed does not\nknow, whose body the seed is, and who pulls (rules) the seed within, he is thy\nSelf, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal; unseen, but seeing; unheard,\nbut hearing; unperceived, but perceiving; unknown, but knowing.
