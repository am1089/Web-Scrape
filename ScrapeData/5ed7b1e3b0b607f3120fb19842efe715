Produce thy stream of flames like a broad onslaught. Go forth impetuous\nlike a king with his elephant [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:1:1); \xe2\x80\xa6\n[2](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:1:2) after thy greedy onslaught, thou art an archer;\nshoot the sorcerers with thy hottest (arrows).\n\n2\\. Thy whirls fly quickly. Fiercely flaming touch (them). O Agni, (send\nforth) with the ladle [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:2:1) thy heat, thy winged\n(flames); send forth unfettered thy firebrands all around.\n\n3\\. Being the quickest, send forth thy spies against (all evildoers). Be an\nundeceivable guardian of this clan. He who attacks us with evil spells, far or\nnear, may no such (foe) defy thy track.\n\n4\\. Rise up, O Agni! Spread out against (all foes)! Burn down the foes, O\n(god) with the sharp weapon! When kindled, O Agni, burn down like dry\nbrushwood, the man who exercises malice against us.\n\n5\\. Stand upright, strike (the foes) away from us! Make manifest thy divine\n(powers), O Agni! Unbend the strong (bows) of those who incite demons (against\nus) [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:5:1). Crush all enemies, be they relations or\nstrangers.\n\n6\\. He knows thy favour, O youngest one, who makes a way for a sacred speech\nlike this. Mayst thou beam forth to his doors all auspicious days and the\nwealth and the splendour of the niggard.\n\n7\\. Let him, O Agni, be fortunate and blessed with good rain, who longs to\ngladden thee with\n\np. 332\n\nconstant offerings and hymns through his life in his house. May such longing\never bring auspicious days to him.\n\n8\\. I praise thy favour; it resounded here. May this song (which is like) a\nfavourite wife, awaken for thee [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:8:1). Let us brighten\nthee, being rich in horses and chariots. Mayst thou maintain our knightly\npower day by day.\n\n9\\. May (the worshipper) here frequently of his own accord approach thee, O\n(god) who shinest in darkness [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:9:1), resplendent day by\nday. Let us worship thee sporting and joyous, surpassing the splendour of\n(other) people.\n\n10\\. Whoever, rich in horses and rich in gold, approaches thee, O Agni, with\nhis chariot full of wealth--thou art the protector and the friend of him who\nalways delights in showing thee hospitality.\n\n11\\. Through my kinship (with thee) I break down the great (foes) by my words\n[1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:11:1). That (kinship) has come down to me from my\nfather Gotama. Be thou attentive to this our word, O youngest, highly wise Hot\n_ri_ , as the friend of our house.\n\n12\\. May those guardians of thine, infallible Agni, sitting down together\nprotect us, the never sleeping, onward-pressing, kind, unwearied ones, who\nkeep off the wolf, who never tire.\n\n13 [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:13:1). Thy guardians, O Agni, who seeing have saved\nthe blind son of Mamata from distress--He the possessor of all wealth has\nsaved them who have done good deeds. The impostors, though trying to deceive,\ncould not deceive.\n\n14\\. In thy companionship we dwell, protected by thee. Under thy guidance let\nus acquire gain. Accomplish both praises [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:14:1), O\n(thou who art the)\n\np. 333\n\ntruth! Do so by thy present power, O fearless one!\n\n15\\. May we worship thee, O Agni, with this log of wood. Accept the hymn of\npraise which we recite. Burn down those who curse us, the sorcerers. Protect\nus, O (god) who art great like Mitra, from guile, from revilement, and from\ndisgrace.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe hymn is addressed to Agni Rakshohan. The same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verses\n1-15 = TS. I, 2, 14, 1-6; MS. IV, 11, 5. Verses 1-5 = VS. XIII, 9-13; MS. II,\n7, 15.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. On ibhena, cf. Pischel-Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, p. xv.\n\nNote 2. The meaning of dru _n_ ana _h_ , which evidently should be pronounced\ndru _n_ ana _h_ (H. O., Prolegomena, p. 478), is uncertain. This verb is\nstated to occur still in one other passage, Maitr. Sa _m_ h. II, 4, 2. tad ya\neva _m_ vidvant suram pibati na haina _m_ dru _n_ ati (dru _n_ ati, two MSS.).\nBut should we not read there hru _n_ ati? [And possibly in our passage, as\nProf. Max Muller observes, hru _n_ ana _h_?]\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On _g_ uhv\xcc\x83a, see Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 113. Wherever butter\nis poured out with the ladle, the flames arise.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The third Pada is identical with X, 116, 5 b.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Or 'resound to thee' (sam _g_ areta). Cf. above, 3, 15. Shall we read,\nin consideration of this parallel\n\np. 334\n\npassage, sam devavata _g_ aratam iyam gi\xc2\xb4h ('may this song beloved by the gods\nresound' or 'awaken')?\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. On doshavasta _h_ , see above, I, 1, 7, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. I have taken mana _h_ as acc. plural. If it is gen. singular, the\ntranslation will be: 'Through my kinship with the great (Agni) I break down\n(my foes) by my words.'\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. This verse is identical with I, 147, 3. See the notes there. The\noriginal place of this verse seems to be in the first Ma _n_ _d_ ala, because\nit mentions Mamateya.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. Probably the praise or song of the gods and of men. See vol. xxxii, p.\n439.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV. 5](sbe46094.htm)\n\n"
