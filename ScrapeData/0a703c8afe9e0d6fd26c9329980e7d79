 \nKing Das\'aratha\'s son, the grace  \nAnd glory of Ikshvaku\'s race.  \nObedient to his father\'s will  \nHe cleaves to sacred duty still.  \nWith rites of royal pomp and pride  \nHis sire the Fire-God gratified;  \nTen hundred thousand kine he freed,  \nAnd priests enriched with ample meed;  \nAnd the broad land protected, famed  \nFor truthful lips and passions tamed.  \nThrough woman\'s guile his son has made  \nHis dwelling in the forest shade,  \nWhere, as he lived with every sense  \nSubdued in hermit abstinence,  \nFierce Ravan\' stole his wife, and he  \nIs come a suppliant, lord, to thee.  \nNow let all honour due be paid  \nTo these great chiefs who seek thine aid.\'  \n   Thus spake the Vanar prince, and, stirred  \nWith friendly thoughts, Sugriva heard.  \nThe light of joy his face o\'erspread,  \nAnd thus to Raghu\'s son he said:  \n\'O Prince, in rules of duty trained,  \nCaring for all with love unfeigned,  \nHanuman\'s tongue has truly shown  \nThe virtues that are thine alone.  \nMy chiefest glory, gain, and bliss,  \nO stranger Prince, I reckon this,  \nThat Raghu\'s son will condescend  \nTo seek the Vanar for his friend.  \nIf thou my true ally wouldst be  \nAccept the pledge I offer thee,  \nThis hand in sign of friendship take,  \nAnd bind the bond we ne\'er will break.\'  \n   He spoke, and joy thrilled Rama\'s breast;  \nSugriva\'s hand he seized and pressed  \nAnd, transport beaming from his eye,  \nHeld to his heart his new ally.  \nIn wanderer\'s weed disguised no more,  \nHis proper form Hanuman wore.  \nThen, wood with wood engendering, 1 came  \nNeath his deft hands the kindled flame.  \nBetween the chiefs that fire he placed  \n\np. 329  \n\nWith wreaths of flowers and worship graced.  \nAnd round its blazing glory went  \nThe friends with slow steps reverent.  \n   Thus each to other pledged and bound  \nIn solemn league new transport found.  \nAnd bent upon his dear ally  \nThe gaze he ne\'er could satisfy.  \n\'Friend of my soul art thou: we share  \nEach other\'s joy, each other\'s care;\'  \nTo us the bliss that thrilled his breast  \nSugriva Raghu\'s son addressed.  \nFrom a high Sal a branch he tore  \nWhich many a leaf and blossom bore,  \nAnd the fine twigs beneath them laid  \nA seat for him and Rama made.  \nThen Hanuman with joyous mind,  \nSon of the God who rules the wind,  \nTo Lakshman gave, his seat to be,  \nThe gay branch of a Sandal tree.  \nThen King Sugriva with his eyes  \nStill trembling with the sweet surprise  \nOf the great joy he could not hide,  \nTo Raghu\'s noblest scion cried:  \n\'O Rama, racked with woe and fear,  \nSpurned by my foes, I wander here.  \nReft of my spouse, forlorn I dwell  \nHere in my forest citadel.  \nOr wild with terror and distress  \nRoam through the distant wilderness.  \nVext by my brother Bali long  \nMy soul has borne the scathe and wrong.  \nDo thou, whose virtues all revere,  \nRelease me from my woe and fear.  \nFrom dire distress tby friend to free  \nIs a high task and worthy thee.\'  \n   He spoke, and Raghu\'s son who knew  \nAll sacred duties men should do.  \nThe friend of justice, void of guile,  \nThus answered with a gentle smile:  \n\'Great Vanar, friends who seek my aid  \nStill find their trust with fruit repaid.  \nBali, thy foe, who stole away  \nThy wife this vengeful hand shall slay.  \nThese shafts which sunlike flash and burn,  \nWinged with the feathers of the *ern,  \nEach swift of flight and sure and dread,  \nWith even knot and pointed head,  \nFierce as the crashing fire-bolt sent  \nBy him who rules the firmament, 1  \nShall reach thy wicked foe and like  \n\nInfuriate serpents hiss and strike.  \nThou, Vanar King, this day shalt see  \nThe foe who long has injured thee  \nLie, like a shattered mountain, low,  \nSlain by the tempest of my bow.\'  \n   Thus Rama spake: Sugriva heard,  \nAnd mighty joy his bosom stirred:  \nAs thus his champion he addressed:  \n\'Now by thy favour, first and best  \nOf heroes, shall thy friend obtain  \nHis realm and darling wife again  \n   Recovered from the foe.  \nCheck thou mine elder brother\'s might;  \nThat ne\'er again his deadly spite  \nMay rob me of mine ancient right,  \n   Or vex my soul with woe.\'  \nThe league was struck, a league to bring  \nTo Sita fiends, and Vanar king  [1b](ry280.htm#fn_557)  \n   Apportioned bliss and bale.  \nThrough her left eye quick throbbings shot, [2b](ry280.htm#fn_558)  \nGlad signs the lady doubted not,  \n   That told their hopeful tale.  \nThe bright left eye of Bali felt  \nAn inauspicious throb that dealt  \n   A deadly blow that day.  \nThe fiery left eyes of the crew  \nOf demons felt the throb, and knew  \n   The herald of dismay.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[328:1](ry279.htm#fr_555) Fire for sacred purposes is produced by the\nattrition of two pieces of wood.
