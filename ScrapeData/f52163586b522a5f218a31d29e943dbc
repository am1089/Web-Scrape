The prince aimed at a bird that was perched on the window-sill of that\nroom, and had not the slightest idea that anybody was at hand, or he would not\nhave shot in that direction. Consequently, not knowing what had happened, he\nand the vizier\'s son walked away, the vizier\'s son chaffing him because he bad\nmissed the bird.\n\nPresently the merchant went to ask his wife about something, and found her\nlying, to all appearance, dead in the middle of the room, and an arrow fixed\nin the ground within half a yard of her head. Supposing that she was dead, he\nrushed to the window and shrieked, "Thieves, thieves! They have killed my\nwife." The neighbours quickly gathered, and the servants came running upstairs\nto see what was the matter. It happened that the woman had fainted, and that\nthere was only a very slight wound in her breast where the arrow had grazed.\n\nAs soon as the woman recovered her senses she told them that two young men had\npassed by the place with their bows and arrows, and that one of them had most\ndeliberately aimed at her as she stood by the window.\n\nOn hearing this the merchant went to the King, and told him what had taken\nplace. His Majesty was much enraged at such audacious wickedness, and swore\nthat most terrible punishment should be visited on the offender if he could be\ndiscovered. He ordered the merchant to go back and ascertain whether his wife\ncould recognise the young men if she saw them again.\n\n"Oh yes," replied the woman, I should know them again among all the people in\nthe city."\n\n"Then," said the King, when the merchant brought back this reply, "to-morrow I\nwill cause all the male inhabitants of this city to pass before your house,\nand your wife will stand at the window and watch for the man who did this\nwanton deed."\n\nA royal proclamation was issued to this effect. So the next day all the men\nand boys of the city, from the age of ten years upwards, assembled and marched\nby the house of the merchant. By chance (for they both had been excused from\nobeying this order) the King\'s son and the vizier\'s son were also in the\ncompany, and passed by in the crowd. They came to see the tamasha.\n\nAs soon as these two appeared in front of the merchant\'s window they were\nrecognised by the merchant\'s wife, and at once reported to the King.\n\n"My own son and the son of my chief vizier!" exclaimed the King, who had been\npresent from the commencement. "What examples for the people! Let them both be\nexecuted."\n\n"Not so, your Majesty," said the vizier, "I beseech you. Let the facts of the\ncase be thoroughly investigated. How is it?" he continued, turning to the two\nyoung men. "Why have you done this cruel thing?"\n\n"I shot an arrow at a bird that was sitting on the sill of an open window in\nyonder house, and missed," answered the prince. "I suppose the arrow struck\nthe merchant\'s wife. Had I known that she or anybody had been near I should\nnot have shot in that direction."\n\n"We will speak of this later on," said the King, on hearing this answer.\n"Dismiss the people. Their presence is no longer needed."\n\nIn the evening his Majesty and the vizier had a long and earnest talk about\ntheir two sons. The King wished both of them to be executed, but the vizier\nsuggested that the prince should be banished from the country. This was\nfinally agreed to.\n\nAccordingly, on the following morning, a little company of soldiers escorted\nthe prince out of the city. When they reached the last custom-house the\nvizier\'s son overtook them. He had come with all haste, bringing with him four\nbags of muhrs on four horses. "I am come," he said, throwing his. arms round\nthe prince\'s neck, "because I cannot let you go alone. We have lived together,\nwe will be exiled together, and we will die together. Turn me not back, if you\nlove me."\n\n"Consider," the prince answered, "what you are doing; All kinds of trial may\nbe before me. Why should you leave your home and country to be with me?"\n\n"Because I love you," he said, "and shall never be happy without you."\n\nSo the two friends walked along hand in hand as fast as they could to get out\nof the country, and behind them marched the soldiers and the horses with their\nvaluable burdens. On reaching a place on the borders of the King\'s dominions\nthe prince gave the soldiers some gold, and ordered them to return. The\nsoldiers took the money and left; they did not, however, go very far, but hid\nthemselves behind rocks and stones, and waited till they were quite sure that\nthe prince did not intend to come back.\n\nOn and on the exiles walked, till they arrived at a certain village, where\nthey determined to spend the night under one of the big trees of the place.\nThe prince made preparations for a fire, and arranged the few articles of\nbedding that they had with them, while the vizier\'s son went to the baniya and\nthe baker and the butcher to get something for their dinner. For some reason\nhe was delayed; perhaps the tsut was not quite ready, or the baniya had not\ngot all the spices prepared. After waiting half an hour the prince became\nimpatient, and rose up and walked about.\n\nHe saw a pretty, clear little brook running along not far from their resting-\nplace, and hearing that its source was not far distant, he started off to find\nit. The source was a beautiful lake, which at that time was covered with the\nmagnificent lotus flower and other water plants. The prince sat down on the\nbank, and being thirsty took up, some of the water in his hand. Fortunately he\nlooked into his hand before drinking, and there, to his great astonishment, he\nsaw reflected whole and clear the image of a beautiful fairy. He looked round,\nhoping to see the reality; but seeing no person, he drank the water, and put\nout his hand to take some more. Again he saw the reflection in the water which\nwas in his palm. He looked around as before, and this time discovered a fairy\nsitting by the bank on the opposite side of the lake. On seeing her he fell so\nmadly in love with her that he dropped down in a swoon.\n\nWhen the vizier\'s son returned, and found the fire lighted, the horses\nsecurely fastened, and the bags of muhrs lying altogether in a heap, but no\nprince, he did not know what to think. He waited a little while, and then\nshouted; but not getting any reply, he got up and went to the brook. There he\ncame across the footmarks of his friend. Seeing these, he went back at once\nfor the money and the horses, and bringing them with him, he tracked the\nprince to the lake, where be found him lying to all appearance dead.\n\n"Alas! alas!" he cried, and lifting up the prince, be poured some water over\nhis head and face. "Alas! \'my brother, what is \'this? Oh! do not die and leave\nme thus. Speak, speak! I cannot bear this!"\n\nIn a few minutes the prince, revived by the water, opened his eyes, and looked\nabout wildly.\n\n"Thank God!" exclaimed the. vizier\'s son. "But what is the matter, brother?"\n\n"Go away," replied the prince. "I don\'t want to say anything to you, or to see\nyou. Go away."\n\n"Come, come; let us leave this place. Look, I have brought some food for you,\nand horses, and everything. Let us eat and depart."\n\n"Go alone," replied the prince.\n\n"Never," said the, vizier\'s son. "What has happened to suddenly estrange you\nfrom me? A little while ago we were brethren, but now you detest the sight of\nme."\n\n"I have looked upon a fairy," the prince said. "But a moment I saw her face;\nfor when she noticed that I was looking at her she covered her face with lotus\npetals. Oh, how beautiful she was! And while I gazed she took out of her bosom\nan ivory box, and held it up to me. Then I fainted. Oh! if you can get me that\nfairy for my wife, I will go anywhere with you."\n\n"Oh, brother," said the vizier\'s son, "you have indeed seen a fairy. She is a\nfairy of the fairies. This is none other than Gulizar of the Ivory City. I\nknow this from the signs that she gave you. From her covering her face with\nlotus, petals I learn her name, and from her showing you the ivory box, I\nlearn where she lives. Be patient, and rest assured that I will arrange your\nmarriage with her."\n\nWhen the prince beard these encouraging words he felt much comforted, rose up,\nand ate, and then went away gladly with his friend.\n\nOn the way they met two men. These two men belonged to a family of robbers.\nThere were eleven of them altogether. One, an elder sister, stayed at home and\ncooked the food, and the other ten--all brothers--went out, two and two, and\nwalked about the four different ways that ran through that part of the\ncountry, robbing those travellers who could not resist them, and inviting\nothers, who were too powerful for two of, them to manage, to come and rest at\ntheir house, where the whole family attacked them and stole their goods. These\nthieves lived in a kind of tower, which had several strong-rooms in it, and\nunder it was a great pit, wherein they threw the corpses of the poor\nunfortunates who chanced to fall into their power.\n\nThe two men came forward, and, politely accosting them, begged them to come\nand stay at their house for the night. "It is late," they said, "and there is\nnot another village within several miles."\n\n"Shall we accept this good man\'s invitation, brother?" asked the prince.\n\nThe vizier\'s son frowned slightly in token of disapproval; but the prince was\ntired, and thinking that it was only a whim of his friend\'s, he said to the\nmen, " Very well. It is very kind of you to ask us."\n\nSo they all four went to the robbers\' tower.\n\nSeated in a room, with the door fastened on the outside, the two travellers\nbemoaned their fate.\n\n"It is no good groaning," said the\' vizier\'s son. "I will climb to the window,\nand see whether, there are any means of escape. Yes! yes!" he whispered, when\nhe had reached the window-hole. "Below there is a ditch surrounded by a high\nwall. I will jump down and reconnoitre. You stay here and wait till I return."\n\nPresently he came back and told the prince that he had seen a most ugly woman,\nwhom he supposed was the robbers\' housekeeper. She had agreed to release them\non the promise of her marriage with the prince.\n\nSo the woman led the way out of the enclosure by a secret door.\n\n"But where are the horses and the goods?" the vizier\'s son inquired.\n\n"You cannot bring them," the woman said. "To go out by any other way would be\nto thrust oneself into the grave."\n\n"All right then; they also shall go out by this door. I have a charm, whereby\nI can make them thin or fat." So the vizier\'s son fetched the horses without\nany person knowing it, and repeating the charm, he made them pass through the\nnarrow doorway like pieces of cloth, and when they were all outside restored\nthem to their former condition. He at once mounted his hone and laid hold of\nthe halter of one of the other horses, and then beckoning to the prince to do\nlikewise, he rode off. The prince saw his opportunity, and in a moment was\nriding after him, having the woman behind him.\n\nNow the robbers heard the galloping of the horses, and ran out and shot their\narrows at the prince and his companions. And one of the arrows killed the\nwoman, so they had to leave her behind.\n\nOn, on they rode, until they reached a village where they stayed the night.\nThe following morning they were off again, and asked for Ivory City from every\npasser-by. At length they came to this famous city, and put up at a little hut\nthat belonged to an old woman, from whom they feared no harm, and with whom,\ntherefore, they could abide in peace and comfort. At first the old woman did\nnot like the idea of these travellers staying in her house, but the sight of a\nmuhr, which the prince dropped in the bottom of a cup in which she had given\nhim water, and a present of another muhr from the vizier\'s son, quickly made\nher change her mind. She agreed to let them stay there for a few days.\n\nAs soon as her work was over the old woman came and sat down with her lodgers.\nThe vizier\'s son pretended to be utterly ignorant of the place and people.\n"Has this city a name?" he asked the old woman.\n\n"Of course it has, you stupid. Every little village, much more a city, and\nsuch a city as this, has a name."\n\n"What is the name of this city?"\n\n"Ivory City. Don\'t you know that? I thought the name was known all over the\nworld."\n\nOn the mention of the name Ivory City the prince gave a deep sigh. The\nvizier\'s son looked as much as to say, "Keep quiet, or you\'ll discover the\nsecret."\n\n"Is there a king of this country?" continued the vizier\'s son.\n\n"Of course there is, and a queen, and a princess."\n\n"What are their names?"\n\n"The name of the princess is Gulizar, and the name of the queen--"\n\nThe vizier\'s son interrupted the old woman by turning to look at the prince,\nwho was staring like a madman. "Yes," he said to him afterwards, "we are in\nthe right country. We shall see the beautiful princess."\n\nOne morning the two travellers noticed the old woman\'s most careful toilette:\nhow careful she was in the arrangement of her hair and the set of her kasabah\nand puts.\n\n"Who is coming?" said the vizier\'s son.\n\n"Nobody," the old woman replied.\n\n"Then where are you going?"\n\n"I am going to see my daughter, who is a servant of the Princess Gulizar. I\nsee her and the princess every day. I should have gone yesterday, if you had\nnot been here and taken up all my time."\n\n"Ah-h-h! Be careful not to say anything about us in the hearing of the\nprincess." The vizier\'s son asked her not to speak about them at the palace,\nhoping that, because she had been told not to do so, she would mention their\narrival, and thus the princess would be informed of their coming.\n\nOn seeing her mother the girl pretended to be very angry. "Why have you not\nbeen for two days?" she asked.\n\n"Because, my dear," the old woman answered, "two young travellers, a prince\nand the son of some great vizier, have taken up their abode in my hut, and\ndemand so much of my attention. It is nothing but cooking and cleaning, and\ncleaning and cooking, all day long. I can\'t understand the men," she added;\n"one of them especially, appears very stupid. He asked me the name of this\ncountry and the name of the King. Now where can these men have come from, that\nthey do not know these things? However, they are very great and very rich.\nThey each give me a muhr every morning and every evening."\n\nAfter this the old woman went and repeated almost the same words to the\nprincess, on the hearing of which the princess beat her severely, and\nthreatened her with a severer punishment if she ever again spoke of the\nstrangers before her.\n\nIn the evening, when the old woman had returned to her hut, she told the\nvizier\'s son how sorry she was that she could not help breaking her promise,\nand how the princess had struck her because she mentioned their coming and all\nabout them.\n\n"Alas! alas!" said the prince, who had eagerly listened to every word. "What,\nthen, will be her anger at the sight of a man?"\n\n"Anger?" said the vizier\'s son, with an astonished air. "She would be\nexceedingly glad to see one man. I know this. In this treatment of the old\nwoman I see her request that you will go and see her during the coming dark\nfortnight."\n\n"Heaven be praised!" the prince exclaimed.\n\nThe next time the old woman went to the palace Gulizar called one of her\nservants and ordered her to rush into the room while she was conversing with\nthe old woman; and if the old woman asked what was the matter, she was to say\nthat the King\'s elephants had gone mad, and were rushing about the city and\nbazaar in every direction, and destroying everything in their way.\n\nThe servant obeyed, and the old woman, fearing lest the elephants should go\nand push down her hut and kill the prince and his friend, begged the princess\nto let her depart. Now Gulizar had obtained a charmed swing, that landed\nwhoever sat on it at the place wherever they wished to be, "Get the swing,"\nshe said to one of the servants standing by. When it was brought she bade the\nold woman step into it and desire to be at home. The old woman did so, and was\nat once carried through the air quickly and safely to her hut, where she found\nher two lodgers safe and sound. "Oh!" she cried, "I thought that both of you\nwould be killed by this time. The royal elephants have got loose and are\nrunning about wildly. When I heard this I was anxious about you. So the\nprincess gave me this charmed swing to return in. But come, let us get outside\nbefore the elephants arrive and batter down the place."\n\n"Don\'t believe this," said the vizier\'s son. "It is a mere hoax. They have\nbeen playing tricks with you."\n\n"You will soon have your heart\'s desire," he whispered aside to the prince.\n"These things are signs."\n\nTwo days of the dark fortnight had elapsed, when the prince and the vizier\'s\nson seated themselves in the swing, and wished themselves within the grounds\nof the palace. In a moment they were there, and there too was the object of\ntheir search standing by one of the palace gates, and longing to see the\nprince quite as much as he was longing to see her.\n\nOh, what a happy meeting it was!\n\n"At last," said Gulizar, "I have seen my beloved, my husband."\n\n"A thousand thanks to Heaven for bringing me to you," said the prince.\n\nThen the prince and Gulizar betrothed themselves to one another and parted,\nthe one for the hut and the other for the palace, both of them feeling happier\nthan they had ever been before.\n\nHenceforth the prince visited Gulizar every day and returned to the hut every\nnight. One morning Gulizar begged him to stay with her always. She was\nconstantly afraid of some evil happening to him--perhaps robbers would slay-\nhim, or sickness attack him, and then she would be deprived of him. She could\nnot live without seeing him. The prince showed her that there was no real\ncause for fear, and said that he felt be ought to return to his friend at\nnight, because he had left his home and country and risked his life for him;\nand, moreover, if it had not been for his friend\'s help he would never have\nmet with her.\n\nGulizar for the time assented, but she determined in her heart to get rid of\nthe vizier\'s son as soon as possible. A few days after this conversation she\nordered one of her maids to make a pilaw. She gave special directions that a\ncertain poison was to be mixed into it while cooking, and as soon as it was\nready the cover was to be placed on the saucepan, so that the poisonous steam\nmight not escape. When the pilaw was ready she sent it at once by the hand of\na servant to the vizier\'s son with this message: _"_ Gulizar _,_ the princess,\nsends you an offering in the name of her dead uncle."\n\nOn receiving the present the vizier\'s son thought that the prince had spoken\ngratefully of him to the princess, and therefore she had thus remembered him.\nAccordingly he sent back his salaam and expressions of thankfulness.\n\nWhen it was dinner-time he took the saucepan of pilaw and went out to eat it\nby the stream. Taking off the lid, he threw it aside on the grass and then\nwashed his hands. During the minute or so that he was performing these\nablutions, the green grass under the cover of the saucepan turned quite\nyellow. He was astonished, and suspecting that there was poison in the pilaw,\nhe took a little and threw it to some crows that were hopping about. The\nmoment the crow sate what was thrown to them they fell down dead.\n\n"Heaven be praised," exclaimed the vizier\'s son, "who has preserved me from\ndeath at this time!"\n\nOn the return of the prince that evening the vizier\'s son was very reticent\nand depressed. The prince noticed this change in him, and asked what was the\nreason. "Is it because I am away so much at the palace?" The vizier\'s son saw\nthat the prince had nothing to do with the sending of the pilaw, and therefore\ntold him everything.\n\n"Look here," he said, "in this handkerchief is some pilaw that the princess\nsent me this morning in the name of her deceased uncle. It is saturated with\npoison. Thank Heaven, I discovered it in-time!"\n\n"Oh, brother! who could have done this thing? Who is there that entertains\nenmity against you?"\n\n"The Princess Gulizar. Listen. The next time you go to see her, I entreat you\nto take some snow with you; and just before seeing the princess put a little\nof it into both your eyes. It will provoke tears, and Gulizar will ask you why\nyou are crying. Tell her that you weep for the loss of your friend, who died\nsuddenly this morning. Look! take, too, this wine and this shovel, and when\nyou have feigned intense grief at the death of your friend, bid the -princess\nto drink a little of the wine. It is strong, and will immediately send her\ninto a deep sleep. Then, while she is asleep, heat the shovel and mark her\nback with it. Remember to bring back the shovel again, and also to take her\npearl necklace. This done, return. Now fear not to execute these instructions,\nbecause on the fulfilment of them depends your fortune and happiness. I will\narrange that your marriage with the princess shall be accepted by the King,\nher father, and all the court."\n\nThe prince promised that he would do everything as the vizier\'s son had\nadvised him; and he kept his promise.\n\nThe following night, on the return of the prince from his visit to Gulizar, he\nand the vizier\'s son, taking the horses and bags of muhrs, went to a graveyard\nabout a mile or so distant. It was arranged that the vizier\'s son should act\nthe part of a fakir and the prince the part of the fakir\'s disciple and\nservant.\n\nIn the morning, when Gulizar had returned to her senses, she felt a smarting\npain in her back, and noticed that her pearl necklace was gone. She went at\nonce and informed the King of the loss of her necklace, but said nothing to\nhim about the pain in her back.\n\nThe King was very angry when he beard of the theft, and caused proclamation\nconcerning it to be madee through-out all the city and surrounding country.\n\n"It is well," said the vizier\'s son, when be heard of this proclamation. "Fear\nnot, my brother, but go and take this necklace, and try to sell it in the\nbazaar."\n\nThe prince took it to a goldsmith and asked him to buy it.\n\n"How much do you want for it?" asked the man. "Fifty thousand rupees," the\nprince replied. "All right," said the man; "wait here while I go and fetch the\nmoney."\n\nThe prince waited and waited, till at last the goldsmith returned, and with\nhim the kotwal, who at once took the prince into custody on the charge of\nstealing the princess\'s necklace.\n\n"How did you get the necklace?" the kotwal asked.\n\n"A fakir, whose servant I am, gave it to me to sell in the bazaar," the prince\nreplied. "Permit me, and I will show you where he is."\n\nThe prince directed the kotwal and the policeman to the place where he had\nleft the vizier\'s son, and there they found the fakir with his eyes shut and\nengaged in prayer. Presently, when he had finished his devotions, the kotwal\nasked him to explain how he had obtained possession of the princess\'s\nnecklace.\n\n"Call the King hither," he replied, "and then I will tell his Majesty face to\nface."\n\nOn this some men went to the King and told him what the fakir had said. His\nMajesty came, and seeing the fakir so solemn and earnest in his devotions, he\nwas afraid to rouse his anger, lest peradventure the displeasure of Heaven\nshould descend on him, and so he placed his hands together in the attitude of\na supplicant, and asked," How did you get my daughter\'s necklace? "\n\n"Last night," replied the fakir, "we were sitting here by this tomb\nworshipping Khuda, when a ghoul, dressed as a princess, came and exhumed a\nbody that had been buried a few days ago, and began to eat it. On seeing this\nI was filled with anger, and beat her back with a shovel, which lay on the\nfire at the time. While running away from me her necklace got loose and\ndropped. You wonder at these words, but they are not difficult to prove.\nExamine your daughter, and you will find the marks of the burn on her back.\nGo, and if it is as I say, send the princess to me, and I will punish her."\n\nThe King went back to the palace, and at once ordered the princess\'s back to\nbe examined.\n\n"It is so," said the maid-servant; "the burn is there."\n\n"Then let the girl be slain immediately," the King shouted.\n\n"No, no, your Majesty," they replied. "Let us send her to the fakir who\ndiscovered this thing, that he may do whatever he wishes with her."\n\nThe King agreed, and so the princess was taken to the graveyard.\n\n"Let her be shut up in a cage, and be kept near the grave whence she took out\nthe corpse," said the fakir.\n\nThis was done, and in a little while the fakir and his disciple and the\nprincess were left alone in the graveyard. Night had not long cast its dark\nmantle over the scene when the fakir and his disciple threw off their\ndisguise, and taking their horses and luggage, appeared before the cage. They\nreleased the princess, rubbed some ointment over the scars on her back, and\nthen sat her upon one of their horses behind the prince. Away they rode fast\nand far, and by the morning were able to rest and talk over their plans in\nsafety. The vizier\'s son showed the princess some of the poisoned pilaw that\nshe had sent him, and asked whether she had repented of her ingratitude. The\nprincess wept, and acknowledged that he was her greatest helper and friend.\n\nA letter was sent to the chief vizier telling him of all that had happened to\nthe prince and the vizier\'s son since they had left their country. When the\nvizier read the letter he went and informed the King. The King caused a reply\nto be sent to the two exiles, in which he ordered them not to return, but to\nsend a letter to Gulizar\'s father, and inform him of everything. Accordingly\nthey did this; the prince wrote the letter at the vizier\'s son\'s dictation.\n\nOn reading the letter Gulizar\'s father was much enraged with his viziers and\nother officials for not discovering the presence in his country of these\nillustrious visitors, as he was especially, anxious to ingratiate himself in\nthe favour of the prince and the vizier\'s son. He ordered the execution of\nsome of the viziers on a certain date.\n\n"Come," he wrote back to the vizier\'s son, "and stay at the palace. And if the\nprince desires it, I will arrange for his marriage with Gulizar as soon as\npossible."\n\nThe prince and the vizier\'s son most gladly accepted the invitation, and\nreceived a right noble welcome from the King. The marriage soon took place,\nand then after a few weeks the King gave them presents of\' horses and\nelephants, and jewels and rich cloths, and bade them start for their own land;\nfor he was sure that the King would now receive them. The night before they\nleft, the viziers and others, whom the King intended to have executed as soon\nas his visitors had left, came and besought the vizier\'s son to plead for\nthem, and promised that they each would give him a daughter in marriage. He\nagreed to do so, and succeeded in obtaining their pardon.\n\nThen the prince, with his beautiful bride Gulizar, and the vizier\'s son,\nattended by a troop of soldiers, and a large number of camels and horses\nbearing very much treasure, left for their own land. In the midst of the way\nthey passed the tower of the robbers, and with the help of the soldiers they\nrazed it to the ground, slew all its inmates, and seized the treasure which\nthey had been amassing there for several years.\n\nAt length they reached their own country, and when the King saw his son\'s\nbeautiful wife and his magnificent retinue he was at once reconciled, and\nordered him to enter the city and take up his abode there.\n\nHenceforth all was sunshine on the path of the prince. He became a great\nfavourite, and in due time succeeded to the throne, and ruled the country for\nmany, many years in peace and happiness.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sun, Moon, and Wind go out to Dinner](ift28.htm)\n\n'
