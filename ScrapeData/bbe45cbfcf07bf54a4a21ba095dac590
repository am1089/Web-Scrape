On account of the plurality of indicatory marks; for that (proof) is\nstronger. This also is declared (in the Purva Mimamsa).\n\nThe Taittiriyaka contains another daharavidya, 'The thousand-headed god, the\nall-eyed one,' &c. (Mahanar. Up. XI). Here the doubt arises whether this\nvidya, as being one with the previously introduced vidya, states qualities to\nbe included in the meditation enjoined in that vidya, or qualities to be\nincluded in the meditations on the highest Self as enjoined in all the\nVedanta-texts.--The former is the case, the Purvapakshin holds, on account of\nthe leading subject-matter. For in the preceding section (X) the meditation on\nthe small ether is introduced as the subject-matter. 'There is the small lotus\nplaced in the middle of the town (of the body), free from all evil, the abode\n\np. 667\n\nof the Highest; within that there is a small space, free from sorrow--what is\nwithin that should be meditated upon' (Mahanar. Up. X, 23). Now, as the lotus\nof the heart is mentioned only in section X, the 'Naraya _n_ a-section' ('the\nheart resembling the bud of a lotus, with its point turned downwards,' XI, 6),\nwe conclude that that section also is concerned with the object of meditation\nto which the daharavidya refers.--Against this view the Sutra declares itself,\n'on account of the majority of indicatory marks'; i.e. there are in the text\nseveral marks proving that that section is meant to declare characteristics of\nthat which constitutes the object of meditation in all meditations on the\nhighest being. For that being which in those meditations is denoted as the\nImperishable, _S_ iva, _S_ ambhu. the highest Brahman, the highest light, the\nhighest entity, the highest Self, and so on, is here referred to by the same\nnames, and then declared to be Naraya _n_ a. There are thus several\nindications to prove that Naraya _n_ a is none other than that which is the\nobject of meditation in all meditations on the Highest, viz. Brahman, which\nhas bliss and the rest for its qualities. By 'linga' (inferential mark) we\nhere understand clauses (vakya) which contain a specific indication; for such\nclauses have, according to the Purva Mima _m_ sa, greater proving power than\nleading subject-matter (prakara _n_ a). The argumentation that the clause '\nthe heart resembling the bud of a lotus flower,' &c., proves that section to\nstand in a dependent relation to the daharavidya, is without force; for it\nbeing proved by a stronger argument that the section refers to that which is\nthe object of meditation in all meditations, the clause mentioned may also be\ntaken as declaring that in the daharavidya also the object of meditation is\nNaraya _n_ a. Nor must it be thought that the accusatives with which the\nsection begins (sahasra _s_ irsham, &c.) are to be connected with the\n'meditating' enjoined in the previous section; for the 'meditating' is there\nenjoined by a gerundive form ('tasmin yad antas tad upasitavyam'), and with\nthis the subsequent accusatives cannot be construed. Moreover, the subsequent\nclause ('all this is Naraya _n_ a,'\n\np. 668\n\n[paragraph continues] &c., where the nominative case is used) shows that those\naccusatives are to be taken in the sense of nominatives.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'the plurality of indicatory marks.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 44.
