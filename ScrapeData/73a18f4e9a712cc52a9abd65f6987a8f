I am\nHe that alone remains in deep sleep, the secondless, uncontradictable *\nattributeless Bliss (\xe1\xb9\xa2iva). (1)\n\nI am neither castes, nor the rules of caste, society and custom, nor for me\nare concentration,\n\np. 27\n\nmeditation, _Yoga_ and other practices; for, all this illusion of "I" and\n"mine" is-rooted in the not-self and is therefore dispellable by the knowledge\nof the self. I am therefore the secondless, uncontradictable, attributeless\nBliss (\xe1\xb9\xa2iva). (2)\n\nI am neither mother, nor father, nor the gods, nor the worlds, nor the _Vedas_\n, nor sacrifices, nor any holy place; for, in deep sleep I am [identical with\nBrahman which however is] not absolute non-existence. I am therefore the\nsecondless, uncontradictable attributeless Bliss (\xe1\xb9\xa2iva). (3)\n\np. 28\n\nNeither the Sankhya doctrine, nor the \xe1\xb9\xa2aiva, nor the Pancharatra, not the\nJaina, nor the Mimamsaka, nor any other, holds good. For, by special\nrealisation it is revealed that my nature is absolutely pure. I am therefore\nthe secondless, uncontradictable. attributeless Bliss (\xe1\xb9\xa2iva). (4)\n\nI am neither above, nor below, nor inside, nor outside, nor middle, nor\nacross, nor before, nor behind; for I am indivisible and one by nature and am\nall-pervading like space. I am therefore the secondless, uncontradictable,\nattributeless Bliss (\xe1\xb9\xa2iva). (5)\n\np. 29\n\nI am neither white, nor black, nor red, nor yellow, nor bent, nor stout, nor\nshort, nor tall, nor even formless; for, I am of the nature of self-\nresplendent consciousness. I am therefore the secondless, uncontradictable,\nattributeless Bliss (\xe1\xb9\xa2iva). (6)\n\nThere is neither teacher, nor science, nor pupil, nor teaching, nor you (the\nhearer), nor I (the speaker), nor this empirical universe; for, I am the\nconsciousness of the reality, which does not admit of differentiation. I am\ntherefore the secondless, uncontradictable, attributeless Bliss (\xe1\xb9\xa2iva). (7)\n\np. 30\n\nFor me there is neither waking nor dream nor deep sleep, nor am I the self\nconditioned by any of these three states ( _vi \xe1\xb9\xa3va_, _taijasa_ or _pr aj\xe1\xb9\x87a_);\nfor, all these are of the nature of nescience, but I am the fourth beyond\nthese three. I am therefore the secondless, uncontradictable, attributeless\nBliss (\xe1\xb9\xa2iva). (8)\n\nAll this universe, being other than the Self, is unreal; for, the Self alone\nis all-inclusive, constitutes the ultimate goal and is self-established and\nself-dependent. I am therefore the secondless, uncontradictable, attributeless\nBliss (\xe1\xb9\xa2iva). (9)\n\np. 31\n\nIt cannot even be said that It is One. How then can there be a second, other\nthan That? There is neither absoluteness nor non-absoluteness, neither non-\nentity nor entity; for It is absolutely non-dual in Its nature. How then can I\ndescribe That which is established by all the Vedantas!\n\nThus ends the ten-versed hymn.\n\n______\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[26:*](wos04.htm#fr_30) Lit. the ultimate remnant.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Hymn to Dakshinamurti](wos05.htm)\n\n'
