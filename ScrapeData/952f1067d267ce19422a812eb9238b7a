Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus ordered, the two strong warriors Cha _nd_ a\nand Mu _nd_ a hurriedly went to the battle, accompanied by a vast army. There\nthey saw the Devi, intent on doing good to the Gods. Then they began to\naddress Her in conciliatory words. O Lady! Dost Thou not know that the\nextraordinarily strong S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umhha, the Lords of the Daityas have\ncrushed down the Devas and vanquished Indra and have become intoxicated with\ntheir victory? O Fair One! Thou art alone! Only Kalika and Thy Lion are with\nThee! It is Thy foolishness that Thou art desirous to conquer S\xc2\x92umbha, who is\nendowed with all power. I think there is no adviser to Thee, man nor woman;\nthe Devas have sent Thee here simply for Thy destruction. Think, O Delicate\nOne! over the powers of Thine as well as those of Thy enemy. Vainly dost Thou\nboast of Thy having eighteen hands. Before the great warrior S\xc2\x92umbha, the\nconqueror of the Devas, many hands and many weapons will be useless; they will\nprove mere burdens. So dost Thou fulfil what reigns in the heart of S\xc2\x92umbha,\nthe destroyer of the legs and the uprooter of the teeth of Airavata elephant.\nVain is Thy boast, O Beloved! Follow my sweet words; they will do good to\nThee, O Large-eyed One! They will destroy Thy pains and give Thee bliss. Those\nactions that lead to pain are to be avoided by the wise; and those that bring\nin happiness are to be served by the Pundits, versed in the S\xc2\x92astras. O Sweet\nspeaking one! Thou art clever. Look at the great strength of S\xc2\x92umbha with Thy\neyes. He has enhanced his glory by crushing down the Devas. And if Thou\nthinkest the gods superior, that is false, for the wise men do not rely on the\nmere guess, full of doubts; they believe what they actually see. S\xc2\x92umbha, hard\nto be conquered in battles, is the great enemy of the Gods; they have been\ncrushed down by him, and have therefore sent Thee here. O Sweet smiling One!\nThou hast been deceived by their sweet words; they, prompted by their selfish\nends, have sent Thee here simply to give Thee trouble. The friends that come\nwith certain business and selfish ends are to be rejected. Friends out of\nreligious motives are only to be sought for refuge. Verily I tell Thee that\nthe gods are terribly selfish. Therefore dost Thou serve S\xc2\x92umbha, the\nconqueror of Indra and the lord of the three worlds; he is a hero, beautiful,\nlovely, cunning and thoroughly expert in the\n\n\n\np. 445\n\n\n\nscience of amorous love. Thou wilt get the prosperity of all the worlds by the\nmere command of S\xc2\x92umbha; therefore make a firm resolve and serve that splendid\nhusband S\xc2\x92umbha.\n\n\n\n18-30. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Universal Mother, hearing the words of Cha\n_nd_ a spoke with a voice deep as thunder. O Boor! Why do you use false\ndeceitful words? Fly away just now. Why shall I make S\xc2\x92umbha my husband,\ndisregarding Hari, Hara and the other Devas? O You, a veritable Fool! I have\nno necessity for My lord; I have got nothing to do with my lord. I Myself am\nthe Lord of all the beings; and I preserve this whole Universe with all the\nlords and beings therein. Note this. In ancient times I saw thousands and\nthousands of S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha and I slew them all. I sent hundreds and\nhundreds of Daityas and Demons to the realm of Death. Before Me the hosts of\nDevas were destroyed in yugas after yugas. Today the Daityas again will go\nunto destruction. The Time has come to destroy the Daityas; why, then, are you\nstruggling in vain with your followers for your lives? Fight now and keep the\nDharma of the warriors; death is inevitable; thinking thus, the high-souled\nones should keep their name, fame, and respect. What business have you to do\nwith S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha? Follow the warrior\xc2\x92s Dharma and go to Heavens, the\nabode of the gods. S\xc2\x92umbha, Nis\xc2\x92umbha and your other friends and followers,\nall will follow you and will come here no doubt. O Stupid One! I will put an\nend to all the Danavas today. Therefore cast aside your weakness and go on,\nfight. I will slay you and your brother just now; next I will kill the proud\nRakta Vija, Nis\xc2\x92umbha and S\xc2\x92umbha and the other Danavas in the battle field\nand will then go to My desired place. Now remain here if you like or fly away\nquickly. You have been fed in vain because you fear to fight. What use is\nthere now in using sweet words like a weak and distressed man. Well! Take up\nyour arms now and fight.\n\n\n\n31-61. Vyasa said :-- O King! Cha _nd_ a and Mu _nd_ a, elated with pride got\nexcited at the Devi\xc2\x92s words, became angry and made a violent noise with their\nbow strings. The Devi, too, blew Her conchshell so loudly that the ten\nquarters of the sky reverberated; in the meanwhile, the powerful lion became\nvery angry and roared loudly. Hearing that sound Indra and other Devas, the\nMunis, Yak _s_ as, Siddhas, and Kinnaras became all very glad. A dreadful\nfight than ensued between Cha _nd_ ika and Cha _nd_ a with arrows, axes and\nother weapons, causing terror to the weak. Then Cha _nd_ ika Devi became very\nwrathful and cut off to pieces all the arrows shot by Cha _nd_ a and then\nhurled arrows serpent-like on him. Then the sky over the battle ground seemed\nto be overcast with arrows just as the\n\n\n\np. 446\n\n\n\nclouds get covered over with locusts, dreadful to the cultivators. In the\nmeanwhile Mu _nd_ a, exceedingly terrible, came up to the field, taking with\nhim his army and becoming impatient with anger began to shoot arrows. Seeing\nthat multitude of arrows, Ambika got very angry; out of Her frowny look, Her\neyebrows became crooked, Her face became black, and Her eyes turned red like\nKadali flowers; at this time suddenly came out of Her forehead Kali. Wearing\nthe tiger\xc2\x92s skin, cruel, covering Her body with elephant\xc2\x92s skin, wearing a\ngarland of skulls, terrible, with a belly like a well dried up, mouth wide\nopen, with a wide waist, lip hanging loosely, with axe, noose, S\xc2\x92iva\xc2\x92s weapon,\nin Her hands, She looked very terrible like the Night of Dissolution. She\nbegan to lick frequently and forcibly dashed into the Danava army and began to\ndestroy it. She angrily began to take the powerful Danavas by Her arms and\npouring them into Her mouth crushed them with Her teeth. Taking the elephants\nwith bells by Her own power in Her hands She put them all into Her mouth and\nswallowed them all with their riders and began to laugh hoarsely. Thus camels,\nhorses and charioteers with chariots all She put into Her mouth and began to\nchew them all grimly. O King! Seeing that the forces were being thus\ndestroyed, the two great warriors Cha _nd_ a and Mu _nd_ a began to shoot\narrows after arrows without intermission and covered the Devi with them. Cha\n_nd_ a hurled the Sudar _s_ an-like disc, lustrous like the Sun, with great\nforce against the Devi, and frequently shouted thundering cries. Seeing him\nroaring and the lustrous disc coming towards Her like another sun, She shot at\nhim arrows sharpened on stones so that the warrior Cha _nd_ a became\noverpowered by them and lay down senseless on the ground. The powerful Mu _nd_\na seeing his brother unconscious became very much distressed with grief; but\nhe got angry and began to shoot arrows immediately on the Devi. Cha _nd_ ika\nDevi hurled the weapon named \xc3\x8e _s_ ika and thus cut off to pieces all the\ndreadful arrows of Mu _nd_ a in a moment and shot Ardha Chandra (semi-\ncircular) arrow at him. With this arrow the powerful Asura was deprived of his\npride and made to lie down unconscious on the earth. Mu _nd_ a thus lying on\nthe ground, a great uproar arose amidst the army of the Danavas; and the Devas\nbecame delighted in the sky. In the meanwhile Cha _nd_ a became conscious and\ntaking a very heavy club hurled it violently on the right hand of Kalika.\nKalika rendered that blow useless and instantly tied down that Asura by Her\nPasa weapon, purified by Mantras. Mu _nd_ a again rose up, and, seeing his\nbrother in that fastened condition, came to the front well armoured and with\nan exceedingly strong weapon called S\xc2\x92akti. Seeing the Asura coming, She\ninstantly fastened him down like his brother. Taking\n\n\n\np. 447\n\n\n\nthe powerful Cha _nd_ a and Mu _nd_ a like hares and laughing wildly, Kali\nwent to Ambika, and said :-- \xc2\x93I have brought the two beasts very auspicious as\nofferings in this sacrificial war. Kindly accept these.\xc2\x94 Seeing the two\nDanavas brought, as if they were the two wolves, Ambika told her sweetly :-- O\nThou, fond of war! Thou art very wise; so dost not commit the act of envy nor\ndost leave them; think over the purport of my words and know that it is Thy\nduty to bring the Devi\xc2\x92s work to a successful issue.\n\n\n\n62-65. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the words of Ambika, Kalika spoke\nto Her again :-- \xc2\x93In this war-sacrifice there is this axe which is like a\nsacrificial post; I will offer these two as victims to Thy sacrifice. Thus no\nact of envy will be committed (i.e., killing in a sacrifice is not considered\nas envy).\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the Kalika Devi cut off their heads with great force\nand gladly drank their blood. Thus seeing the two Asuras killed, Ambika said\ngladly :-- Thou hast done the service to the gods; so I will give Thee an\nexcellent boon. O Kalika! As Thou hast killed Cha _nd_ a and Mu _nd_ a,\nhenceforth Thou wilt be renowned in this world as Chamu _nd_ a.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-sixth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the killing of Cha\n_nd_ a and Mu _nd_ a in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 27](bk05ch27.htm)\n\n'
