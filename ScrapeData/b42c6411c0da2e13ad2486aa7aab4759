Prayer for exemption from disease and death.\n\n1\\. From near thy vicinity, from near thy distance (do I call): remain here,\ndo not follow; do not follow the Fathers of yore! Firmly do I fasten thy\nlife's breath.  \n2\\. Whatever sorcery any kinsman or stranger has practised against thee, both\nrelease and deliverance with my voice do I declare for thee.  \n3\\. If thou hast deceived or cursed a woman or a man in thy folly, both\nrelease and deliverance with my voice do I declare for thee.  \n4\\. If thou liest (ill) in consequence of a sin committed by thy mother or thy\nfather, both release and deliverance with my voice do I declare for thee.  \n5\\. Fight shy of the medicine which thy mother and thy father, thy sister and\nthy brother let out against thee: I shall cause thee to live unto old age!  \n6\\. Remain here, O man, with thy entire soul; do not follow the two messengers\nof Yama: come to the abodes of the living!  \n7\\. Return when called, knowing the outlet of the path (death), the ascent,\nthe advance, the road of every living man!  \n8\\. Fear not, thou shalt not die: I shall cause thee to live unto old age! I\nhave charmed away from thy limbs the disease that wastes the limbs.  \n9\\. The disease that racks and wastes thy limbs, and the sickness in thy\nheart, has flown as an eagle to a far distance, overcome by my charm.  \n10\\. The two sages Alert and Watchful, the sleepless and the vigilant, these\ntwo guardians of thy life's breath, are awake both day and night.  \n11\\. Agni here is to be revered; the sun shall rise here for thee: rise thou\nfrom deep death, yea from black darkness!  \n12\\. Reverence be to Yama, reverence to death; reverence to the Fathers and to\nthose that lead (to them) [death's messengers?]! That Agni who knows the way\nto save do I engage for this man, that he be exempt from harm!  \n13\\. His breath shall come, his soul shall come, his sight shall come, and,\ntoo, his strength! His body shall collect itself: then shall he stand firm\nupon his feet!  \n14\\. Unite him, Agni, with breath and sight, provide him with a body and with\nstrength! Thou hast a knowledge of immortality: let him not now depart, let\nhim not now become a dweller in a house of clay!  \n15\\. Thy in-breathing shall not cease, thy outbreathing shall not vanish;\nSurya (the sun), the supreme lord, shall raise thee from death with his rays!  \n16\\. This tongue (of mine), bound (in the mouth, yet) mobile, speaks within:\nwith it I have charmed away disease, and the hundred torments of the takman\n(fever).  \n17\\. This world is most dear to the gods, unconquered. For whatever death thou\nwast destined when thou wast born, O man, that (death) and we call after thee:\ndo not die before old age!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 9.
