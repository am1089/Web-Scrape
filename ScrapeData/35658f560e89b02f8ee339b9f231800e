The Vayaviya Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n4\\. "The Puran\xcc\x81a in which Vayu has declared the laws of duty, in connexion\nwith the Sweta Kalpa, and which comprises the Mahatmya of Rudra, is the\nVayaviya Puran\xcc\x81a: it contains twenty-four thousand verses 42." The \xc5\x9aiva or\n\xc5\x9aaiva Puran\xcc\x81a is, as above remarked, omitted in some of the lists; and in\ngeneral, when that is the case, it is replaced by the Vayu or Vayaviya. When\nthe \xc5\x9aiva is specified, as in the Bhagavata, then the Vayu is omitted;\nintimating the possible identity of these two works. This indeed is confirmed\nby the Matsya, which describes the Vayaviya Puran\xcc\x81a as characterised by its\naccount of the greatness of Rudra or Siva 43; and Balambhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a mentions that\nthe Vayaviya is also called the \xc5\x9aaiva, though, according to some, the latter\nis the name of an Upa-puran\xcc\x81a. Col. Vans Kennedy observes, that in the west of\nIndia the \xc5\x9aaiva is commonly considered to be an Upa or \'minor\' Puran\xcc\x81a 44.\n\nAnother proof that the same work is intended by the authorities here followed,\nthe Bhagavata and Matsya, under different appellations, is their concurrence\nin the extent of the work, each specifying its verses to be twenty-four\nthousand. A copy of the \xc5\x9aiva Puran\xcc\x81a, of which an index and analysis have been\nprepared, does not contain more than about seven thousand: it cannot therefore\nbe the \xc5\x9aiva Puran\xcc\x81a of the Bhagavata; and we may safely consider that to be\nthe same as the Vayaviya of the Matsya 45.\n\nThe Vayu Puran\xcc\x81a is narrated by Suta to the Rishis at Naimisharan\xcc\x81ya, as it\nwas formerly told at the same place to similar persons by Vayu; a repetition\nof circumstances not uncharacteristic of the inartificial style of this\nPuran\xcc\x81a. It is divided into four Padas, termed severally Prakriya, Upodghata,\nAnushanga, and Upasanhara; a classification peculiar to this work. These are\npreceded by an index, or heads of chapters, in the manner of the Mahabharata\nand Ramayan\xcc\x81a; another peculiarity.\n\nThe Prakriya portion contains but a few chapters, and treats chiefly\n\np. xxiii\n\nof elemental creation, and the first evolutions of beings, to the same purport\nas the Vishn\xcc\x81u, but in a more obscure and unmethodical style. The Upodghata\nthen continues the subject of creation, and describes the various Kalpas or\nperiods during which the world has existed; a greater number of which is\nspecified by the \xc5\x9aaiva than by the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Puran\xcc\x81as. Thirty-three are here\ndescribed, the last of which is the Sweta or \'white\' Kalpa, from \xc5\x9aiva\'s being\nborn in it of a white complexion. The genealogies of the patriarchs, the\ndescription of the universe, and the incidents of the first six Manwantaras,\nare all treated of in this part of the work; but they are intermixed with\nlegends and praises of \xc5\x9aiva, as the sacrifice of Daksha, the Mahe\xc5\x9bwara\nMahatmya, the Nilakantha Stotra, and others. The genealogies, although in the\nmain the same as those in the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Puran\xcc\x81as, present some variations. A\nlong account of the Pitris or progenitors is also peculiar to this Puran\xcc\x81a; as\nare stories of some of the most celebrated Rishis, who were engaged in the\ndistribution of the Vedas.\n\nThe third division commences with an account of the seven Rishis and their\ndescendants, and describes the origin of the different classes of creatures\nfrom the daughters of Daksha, with a profuse copiousness of nomenclature, not\nfound in any other Puran\xcc\x81a. With exception of the greater minuteness of\ndetail, the particulars agree with those of the Vishn\xcc\x81u P. A chapter then\noccurs on the worship of the Pitris; another on Tirthas, or places sacred to\nthem; and several on the performance of Sraddhas, constituting the Sraddha\nKalpa. After this, comes a full account of the solar and lunar dynasties,\nforming a parallel to that in the following pages, with this difference, that\nit is throughout in verse, whilst that of our text, as noticed in its place,\nis chiefly in prose. It is extended also by the insertion of detailed accounts\nof various incidents, briefly noticed in the Vishn\xcc\x81u, though derived\napparently from a common original. The section terminates with similar\naccounts of future kings, and the same chronological calculations, that are\nfound in the Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nThe last portion, the Upasanhara, describes briefly the future Manwantaras,\nthe measures of space and time, the end of the world, the\n\np. xxiv\n\nefficacy of Yoga, and the glories of \xc5\x9aiva-pura, or the dwelling of \xc5\x9aiva, with\nwhom the Yogi is to be united. The manuscript concludes with a different\nhistory of the successive teachers of the Vayu Puran\xcc\x81a, tracing them from\nBrahma to Vayu, from Vayu to Vrihaspati, and from him, through various deities\nand sages, to Dwaipayan\xcc\x81a and \xc5\x9auta.\n\nThe account given of this Puran\xcc\x81a in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of\nBengal was limited to something less than half the work, as I had not then\nbeen able to procure a larger portion. I have now a more complete one of my\nown, and there are several copies in the East India Company\'s library of the\nlike extent. One, presented by His Highness the Guicowar, is dated Samvat\n1540, or A. D. 1483, and is evidently as old as it professes to be. The\nexamination I have made of the work confirms the view I formerly took of it;\nand from the internal evidence it affords, it may perhaps be regarded as one\nof the oldest and most authentic specimens extant of a primitive Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\nIt appears, however, that we have not yet a copy of the entire Vayu Puran\xcc\x81a.\nThe extent of it, as mentioned above, should be twenty-four thousand verses.\nThe Guicowar MS. has but twelve thousand, and is denominated the Purvarddha,\nor first portion. My copy is of the like extent. The index also spews that\nseveral subjects remain untold; as, subsequently to the description of the\nsphere of \xc5\x9aiva, and the periodical dissolution of the world, the work is said\nto contain an account of a succeeding creation, and of various events that\noccurred in it, as the birth of several celebrated Rishis, including that of\nVyasa, and a description of his distribution of the Vedas; an account of the\nenmity between Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha and Viswamitra; and a Naimisharan\xcc\x81ya Mahatmya. These\ntopics are, however, of minor importance, and can scarcely carry the Puran\xcc\x81a\nto the whole extent of the verses which it is said to contain. If the number\nis accurate, the index must still omit a considerable portion of the\nsubsequent contents.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxii:42](vp008.htm#fr_41) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_02200.jpg)\n\n[xxii:43](vp008.htm#fr_42) Commentary on the Mitakshara, Vyavahara Kan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a.\n\n[xxii:44](vp008.htm#fr_43) As.
