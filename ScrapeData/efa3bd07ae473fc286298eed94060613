And as he walked along, the goblin said to him again:\n"O King, listen to a very condensed story."\n\n\n\nThere is a city called Benares. In it lived a Brahman named Devaswami, whom\nthe king honoured. He was very rich, and he had a son named Hariswami. This\nson had a wonderful wife, and her name was Beautiful. No doubt the Creator put\ntogether in her the priceless elements of charm and loveliness after his\npractice in making the nymphs of heaven.\n\nOne night Hariswami was sleeping on a balcony cooled by the rays of the moon.\nAnd a fairy prince named Love-speed was flying through the air, and as he\npassed he saw Beautiful asleep beside her husband. He took her, still asleep,\nand carried her off through the air.\n\nPresently Hariswami awoke, and not seeing the mistress of his life, he rose in\nanxiety. And he wondered: "Oh, where has my wife gone? Is she angry with me?\nOr is she playing hide-and-seek with me, to see how I will take it?" So he\nroamed anxiously all over the balcony during the rest of the night. But he did\nnot find her, though he searched as far as the garden.\n\nThen he was overcome by his sorrow and sobbed convulsively. "Oh, Beautiful, my\ndarling! Fair as the moon! White as the moonlight! Was the night jealous of\nyour beauty; did she carry you away? Your loveliness shamed the moon who\nrefreshed me with beams cool as sandal; but now that you are gone, the same\nbeams torment me like blazing coals, like poisoned arrows!"\n\nAnd as Hariswami lamented thus, the night came to an end, but his anguish did\nnot end. The pleasant sun scattered the darkness, but could not scatter the\nblind darkness of Hariswami\'s madness. His pitiful lamentations increased a\nhundredfold, when the nightly cries of the birds ended. His relatives tried to\ncomfort him, but he could not pluck up courage while his loved one was lost.\nHe went here and there, sobbing out: "Here she stood. And here she bathed. And\nhere she adorned herself. And here she played."\n\nHis relatives and friends gave him good advice. "She is not dead," they said.\n"Why should you make way with yourself? You will surely find her. Pluck up\ncourage and hunt for her. Nothing is impossible to the brave and determined\nman." And when they urged him, Hariswami after some days plucked up heart.\n\nHe thought: "I will give all my fortune to the Brahmans, and then wander to\nholy places. Thus I will wear away my sins, and when my sins are gone, perhaps\nI shall find my darling in my wanderings." So he arose and bathed.\n\nOn the next day he provided food and drink, and made a great feast for the\nBrahmans, and gave them all he had except his piety. Then he started to wander\nto holy places, hoping to find his wife.\n\nAs he wandered, the summer came on him like a lion, the blazing sun its mouth,\nand the sunbeams its mane. And the hot wind blew, made hotter yet by the sighs\nof travellers separated from their wives. And the yellow mud dried and\ncracked, as if the lakes were broken-hearted at the loss of their lotuses. And\nthe trees, filled with chirping birds, seemed to lament the absence of the\nspring, and their withering leaves seemed like lips that grow dry in the heat.\n\nAt this time Hariswami was distressed by the heat and the loss of his wife, by\nhunger, thirst, and weariness. And as he sought for food, he came to a\nvillage. There he saw many Brahmans eating in the house of a Brahman named\nLotus-belly, and he leaned against the doorpost, speechless and motionless.\n\nThen the good wife of that pious Brahman pitied him, and she thought: "Hunger\nis a heavy burden. It makes anyone light. Look at this hungry man standing\nwith bowed head at the door. He looks like a pious man who has come from a far\ncountry, and he is tired. Therefore he is a proper person for me to feed."\n\nSo the good woman took in her hands a dish filled with excellent rice, melted\nbutter, and candied sugar, and courteously gave it to him. And she said: "Go\nto the edge of our pond, and eat it."\n\nHe thanked her, took the dish, went a little way, and set it down under a fig-\ntree on the edge of the pond. Then he washed his hands and feet in the pond,\nrinsed his mouth, and joyfully drew near to eat the good food.\n\nAt that moment a hawk settled on the tree, carrying a black snake in his beak\nand claws. And the snake died in the grasp of the hawk, and his mouth opened,\nand a stream of poison came out. This poison fell into the dish of food.\n\nBut Hariswami did not see it. He came up hungry, and ate it all. And\nimmediately he felt the terrible effects of the poison. He stammered out: "Oh,\nwhen fate goes wrong, everything goes wrong. Even this rice and the milk and\nthe melted butter and the candied sugar is poison to me." And he staggered up\nto the Brahman\'s wife and said: "Oh, Brahman\'s wife, I have been poisoned by\nthe food you gave me. Bring a poison-doctor at once. Otherwise you will be the\nmurderer of a Brahman."\n\nAnd the good woman was terribly agitated. But while she was running about to\nfind a poison-doctor, Hariswami turned up his eyes and died. Thus, though she\nwas not to blame, though she was really charitable, the poor wife was\nreproached by the angry Brahman who thought she had murdered her guest. She\nwas falsely accused for a really good action. So she was dejected and went on\na pilgrimage.\n\nWhen he had told this story, the goblin said: "O King, who murdered the\nBrahman? the snake, or the hawk, or the  woman who gave him the food, or her\nhusband? This was discussed in the presence of the god of death, but they\ncould not decide. Therefore, O King, do you say. Who killed the Brahman?\nRemember the curse, if you know and do not tell the truth."\n\nThen the king broke silence and said: "Who did the murder? The snake cannot be\nblamed, because he was being eaten by his enemy and could not help himself.\nThe hawk was hungry and saw nothing. He was not to blame. And how can you\nblame either or both of the charitable people who gave food to a guest who\narrived unexpectedly? They were quite virtuous, and cannot be blamed. I should\nsay that the dead man himself was to blame, for he  dared to accuse one of the\nothers."\n\nWhen the goblin heard this, he jumped from the king\'s shoulder and escaped to\nthe sissoo tree. And the king ran after him again, determined to catch him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Thirteenth Goblin: The Girl who showed Great Devotion to the Thief. Did\nhe weep or laugh?](ttg14.htm)\n\n'
