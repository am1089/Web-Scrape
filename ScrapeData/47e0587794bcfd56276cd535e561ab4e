Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing their words, the princess began to\ntremble; but holding on patience she spoke to them in reserved terms thus :--\nYou are the sons of Surya and you are the acknowledged deities amongst the\ngods; specially you know everything, I am a chaste virtuous woman. You ought\nnot to speak to me in the above mannner. O Twin Devas! Father has betrothed me\nto the Muni practising the Yoga Dharma; besides I am chaste; how can I behave\nlike a prostitute! This Sun is the Witness of the actions good or bad of all\npeople; He is therefore looking on our actions also. Besides you both are born\nin the family of the high-souled Kas'yapa. Thus it is utterly wrong for you to\nutter such (irreligious and infamous) words. You know well the course of\nDharma, what is religious and what is irreligious in this world which has got\nnothing substantial; how can a family woman leave her husband and serve\nanother? Go wherever you like, O Sinless Devas! I am the daughter Sukanya of\nthe King S'aryati, devoted to my husband. Otherwise I will curse you.\n\n\n\n7-11. Vyasa said :-- O Bharata! Hearing these words, the As'vins were greatly\nsurprised, and, afraid of the Muni, spoke again :-- \xc2\x93O Princess! We are very\nmuch pleased to see your chastity; therefore, O Beautiful Woman! Ask boon from\nus; we will grant it for your welfare. O honoured Woman! We, the physicians of\nthe gods, will certainly make your husband exceedingly beautiful and young, O\nSmart and Intelligent One! When we three will be exactly the same in figure,\nage and lustre! you better can make one of us your husband.\xc2\x94 Hearing their\nwords Sukanya became greatly amazed and went to her own husband and spoke\neverything what they, the God's physicians, said.\n\n\n\n12-17. Sukanya said :-- \xc2\x93O Husband! The As'vins, the Surya's sons, have come\nclose to our \xc3\x82s'rama. I have seen the two Devas and their bright bodies.\nSeeing me beautiful they were overpowered with passion and told me, \xc2\x93We will,\nbe sure, make your blind husband, young, bright and give him his two eyes\nagain; but you will have to make one condition. Hear it :--Your husband will\nbe exactly like us and you will\n\n\n\np. 610\n\n\n\nhave to select your husband amongst three of us.\xc2\x94 O Holy One! Hearing this as\nstrange, I now come to inform you. Now judge and say what I am to do now. The\nDeva's Maya is very difficult to comprehend; the more so, when I do not know\ntheir intentions! O Omniscient One! I will act as you desire.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n18-19. Chyavana said :-- \xc2\x93O Beloved! Go just now, at my word, to the As'vins\nand bring them, O auspicious One! before me. What more shall I say than this\n:-- Go and observe, what they say, as early as possible. There is no need to\nthink over this matter.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n20-25. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus getting the permission from her husband,\nSukanya went immediately to them and said :-- \xc2\x93O As'vins! You are the chief\ngods; now do as you say. I agree to observe what you desire.\xc2\x94 Hearing her\nwords, the two Devas then went to the Muni's \xc3\x82s'rama and told the princess :--\n\xc2\x93Let your husband enter in the midst of the water.\xc2\x94 The aged Chyavana Muni\nwent down quickly in the midst of waters to attain a good form. Next the two\nAs'vins entered into the water of that tank. A few minutes after, the three\npersons came out of the tank. All were equally bright, equally beautiful,\nequally young and their limbs were decorated equally with earrings and various\nother ornaments. They all spoke simultaneously :--\xc2\x93O Auspicious One! There is\nno other woman beautiful like you, especially your face is very clean and\nfair; therefore select any one of us three as your husband. O Fair One!\nWhomever you love most, choose him.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n26-30. Vyasa said :-- O King! Sukanya then saw their bodies are equally bright\nand beautiful; not the least difference is to be found in beauty, age, voice\nand dress. She became doubtful on seeing their equal appearances. The\nprincess, not being able to distinguish her husband, became very anxious and\nthought :-- \xc2\x93What am I to do now? Whom to choose? They are exactly the same. I\ncannot distinguish who is my real husband? This may be the magic set up by the\ntwo As'vins. However, I am put to a great crisis. I won't ever select another\nwho is not my husband. Therefore my death is well nigh; what to do now? The\nthird form seen now may be also a Deva's son.\xc2\x94 Thus cogitating, she resolved\nto meditate on the Highest Prakriti, the Lady of the Universe, the most\nAuspicious One. Then the thin-bellied princess began to sing the hymns of the\nBhagavati.\n\n\n\n31-38. Sukanya said :-- \xc2\x93O World-Mother! Under most painful circumstances I\ntake refuge unto Thee; preserve my chastity; I bow\n\n\n\np. 611\n\n\n\ndown to Thy feet. O Devi! Salutations to Thee, born of lotus. O Thou, the dear\nconsort of S'a _n_ kara! Salutations to Thee. O Thou favourite to Vi _sn_ u, O\nMother of the Vedas! O Sarasvati! Salutations to Thee, Thou hast created the\nworld, moving and unmoving; Thou art preserving it without being least\nexcited; again Thou art swallowing it for the peace and well-being of all.\nWhat more, Thou art the Most Worshipful Mother of Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and\nMahes'a. Thou always illuminest the understanding of the illiterate and Thou\nalways grantest liberation to the J\xc3\xb1anins. Thou art the Prime Prakriti in\nfullness and the Beloved of the Prime Puru _s_ a. Thou grantest Bhukti\n(enjoyment) and Mukti (freedom) to the souls that are cleansed and pure; Thou\ngivest pain to those that are entirely void of knowledge and Thou grantest\nhappiness to those that are endowed with Sattva Gu _n_ a. O Mother! Thou\nbestowest Siddhi (the success, the eight supernatural powers), fame, and\nvictory to the Yogis! Being merged in an ocean of bewilderment, I come now to\ntake refuge unto Thee. O Mother! The two Devas are playing hypocrisy with me;\nthus puzzled I can\xc2\x92t fix my mind whom to select; therefore I am merged in an\nocean of sorrow. Save me by showing my real husband. O Omniscient One! Knowing\nmy vow of chastity dost Thou enlighten me so that I can know my husband.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39-58. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus pleased by the Sukanya's prayers, the Devi\nTripura Sundari then imparted to her the pleasant Sattva J\xc3\xb1an (knowledge\npertaining to Sattva Gu _n_ a). She then looked again at the three personages,\nand though they were similar in appearance and beauty, instantly she\nrecognised mentally her husband and chose him. When Sukanya selected the Muni\nChyavana, the two Devas became greatly pleased to see that. The two Devas were\npleased by the grace of Bhagavati; they were further pleased to see the Dharma\nof chastity and granted her the boon. They then bade good-bye to Chyavana and\nwere ready to start to their own place when Chyavana being very much pleased\nto get through their grace, his beauty, youth and wife, interrupted them,\nsaying \xc2\x93O high-minded Devas! You have done much good to me. I used to feel\npain every day, in spite of my having this wife having good hairs! But owing\nto your mercy, I cannot describe how happy I am now in this world of woes and\ntroubles. I was very aged and blind and was without any enjoyment but it is\nyou that coming to this forest have brought to me eyes, youth and exquisite\nbeauty. Therefore, O twin Devas! I desire to do something good to you in\nreturn. Fie on him, who does not return anything for the good that he has\nreceived from a beneficent friend. That man remains indebted\n\n\n\np. 612\n\n\n\nfor ever in this world; therefore I am desirous to give you two now whatever\nyou want. O twin Devas! Even if the Devas or the Asuras find it difficult to\nattain, I will give that to you to free myself of the debt I owe to you. I am\ngreatly pleased at your good deed; therefore be kind enough to speak out\nwhatever you desire.\xc2\x94 They began to consult with each other, and spoke to the\nMuni Chyavana who was seated with Sukanya beside him :-- \xc2\x93O Mahar _s_ i! We\nhave got all our desires by the grace of Father! Still it is difficult for us\nto drink some libation along with the other Devas and we thirst after that\nvery strongly. At the great sacrifice of Brahma in the Golden Mountain\n(Kanakachala), Indra, the King of the Devas, ordered us not to drink Soma, as\nwe were physicians. Therefore, O Knower of Dharma! O Ascetic! You will\ncertainly do us a great favour if you can make us drink the Soma juice; we\nwould be very glad and have our desires satisfied.\xc2\x94 Thus hearing the words of\nthe As'vins, Mahar _s_ i Chyavana gladly spoke to them the following gentle\nwords, O Twin Devas! I was blind and aged; but now I am become a young and\nbeautiful man, and it is by your grace that I have got back my wife. Therefore\nI speak this truly before you that at the great sacrifice of the lustrous King\nS'aryati, I will gladly make you drink the Soma in the presence of Indra, the\nKing of the Devas. Hearing these words of the Muni, the twin As'vins were\ngreatly pleased and went back to the world of the Devas. And the Muni\nChyavana, too, returned to his own As'rama with his wife Sukanya.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the getting of youth by\nChyavana Muni in S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam the Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000\nverses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk07ch06.htm)\n\n"
