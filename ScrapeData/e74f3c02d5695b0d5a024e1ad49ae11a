Now, it is nine Samish _t_ aya _g_ us 2 he offers on this occasion.\nThe reason why he offers nine Samish _t_ aya _g_ us is that those stotra-\nverses at the Bahishpavamana 3 chant amount to nine. Thus there is at both\nends an inferior (incomplete) vira _g_  4, for the\n\np. 375\n\nsake of production: it was from that same inferior (lower) source of\nproduction on both sides that Pra _g_ apati produced the creatures,--from the\none (he created) the upright, and from the other those tending to the ground.\nAnd in like manner does he (the Adhvaryu) now create creatures from that lower\nsource of production on both sides,--from the one the upright, and from the\nother those tending to the ground.\n\n4:4:4:22\\. The call 'Hi _m_ ' is the tenth of stotra-verses, and the 'Svaha'\n(the tenth) of these (Samish _t_ aya _g_ us): and thus does this incomplete\nvira _g_ come to consist of tens and tens.\n\n4:4:4:33\\. And as to why they are called Samish _t_ aya _g_ us. Whatever\ndeities he invites at this sacrifice, and for whatever deities this sacrifice\nis performed, they all are thereby 'sacrificed-to together' (sam-ish _t_ a);\nand because, after all those (deities) have been 'sacrificed-to together,' he\nnow offers those (libations), therefore they are called Samish _t_ aya _g_ us.\n\n4:4:4:44\\. And as to why he offers the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us. Now, the self of\nhim who has sacrificed has, as it were, become emptied, since he gives away of\nwhatever is his: it is him he fills again by three out of these (oblations).\n\n4:4:4:55\\. And as to the three following which he offers,--whatever deities he\ninvites at this sacrifice, and for whatever deities this sacrifice is\nperformed, they continue waiting till the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us are performed,\nthinking, 'These, forsooth, he must offer unto us!' It is these same deities\nhe thereby dismisses in due form whithersoever their course lies.\n\n4:4:4:66\\. And as to the three last which he offers,--in performing the\nsacrifice he has produced it, and,\n\np. 376\n\nhaving produced it, he firmly establishes it where there is a safe resting-\nplace for it: this is why he performs the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us.\n\n4:4:4:77\\. He offers (the first) with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 15; Rig-veda V, 42,\n4), 'With thought lead us, O Indra, to meet with kine,'--'with thought him who\nwas emptied he thereby fills with thought; with kine;' him who was emptied he\nthereby fills with kine;--'with patrons, O mighty Lord, with well-being; with\nprayer which is divinely inspired 1,'--'with prayer:' him who was emptied he\nthereby fills with prayer;--'with the favour of the adorable gods! Hail!'\n\n4:4:4:88\\. [The second with Va _g_. S. VIII, 16], 'With lustre, with sap, with\nbodies,'--'with lustre him who was emptied he thereby fills with lustre; with\nsap,'--sap is vigour--him who was emptied he thus fills with sap;--'We have\nunited, with the happy spirit: may Tvash _t_ _ri_ , the dispenser of boons,\ngrant us riches, and may he smooth what was injured in our body!' Thus they\nheal what was torn.\n\n4:4:4:99\\. [The third with Va _g_. S. VIII, I7; Atharva-veda VII, 17, 4], 'May\nthe gracious Dhat _ri_ , Savit _ri_ , Pra _g_ apati, the guardian of\ntreasures, and the divine Agni accept this (offering); and Tvash _t_ _ri_ and\nVish _n_ u: grant ye willingly to the sacrificer wealth together with\nchildren! Hail!' Him who was emptied he fills again, when he says, 'grant ye\nwealth to the sacrificer, Hail!'\n\np. 377\n\n4:4:4:1010\\. [The fourth with Va _g_. S. VIII, 18 1], 'Accessible homes have\nwe prepared for you, O gods, who graciously came to this Soma feast;'--whereby\nhe means to say, 'seats easy of access we have prepared for you, O gods, who\nhave graciously come to this Soma feast;'--'Carrying and driving the\nofferings,' thereby he dismisses the several deities; 'Those forsooth who are\nwithout cars may go away carrying; and those who have cars may go away\ndriving,' this is what he means to say; therefore he says, 'Carrying and\ndriving the offerings;'--'bestow goods on him, ye good! Hail!'\n\n4:4:4:1111\\. [The fifth with Va _g_. S. VIII, 19; Atharva-veda VII, 97, 3],\n'The willing gods whom thou, O God, broughtest hither, speed them each to his\nown abode, O Agni!' For to Agni he said, 'Bring hither such and such gods!\nbring hither such and such gods!' and to him he now says, 'Whatever gods thou\nhast brought hither, make them go whithersoever their course lies!'--'Ye have\nall eaten and drunk,'--for they have eaten the cakes of the animal offering,\nand they have drunk the king Soma: therefore he says, 'ye have all eaten and\ndrunk;'--'Draw ye nigh to the air, to the heat, to the light! H ail!' Hereby,\nthen, he dismisses the deities.\n\n4:4:4:1212\\. [The sixth with Va _g_. S. VIII, 20], 'Thee, O Agni, have we\nchosen here for our Hot _ri_ at the opening of this sacrifice: severally hast\nthou offered to them, and severally hast thou toiled; well-knowing the\nsacrifice, draw thou nigh 2, thou the wise! Hail!' by this (verse) he releases\nAgni, dismisses Agni.\n\np. 378\n\n4:4:4:1313\\. [The seventh with Va _g_. S. VIII, 21], 'Ye path-finding gods,'--\nfor the gods are, indeed, the finders of the path;--'having found the\npath,'--'having found the sacrifice,' he thereby means to say;--'go ye in the\npath!' therewith he dismisses them in due form;--'O divine Lord of mind, this\nsacrifice--Svaha!--give thou to the wind!' for the sacrifice, indeed, is\nyonder blowing (wind): having thus completed this sacrifice, he establishes it\nin that sacrifice, and thus unites sacrifice with sacrifice,--hence he says,\n'Svaha! give (it) to the wind!'\n\n4:4:4:1414\\. [The eighth with Va _g_. S. VIII, 22], 'O sacrifice, go to the\nsacrifice, go to the lord of the sacrifice, go to thine own womb, Hail!'--the\nsacrifice, thus established, he thereby establishes in its own womb. [The\nninth he offers with], 'This is thy sacrifice, O lord of the sacrifice,\nbestowing numerous heroes, together with the song of praise: do thou accept\nit, Hail!' the sacrifice, thus established, bestowing numerous heroes,\ntogether with the song of praise he thereby finally establishes in the\nsacrificer.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[374:2](sbe2658.htm#fr_875) See I, 9, 2, 25 seq.\n\n[374:3](sbe2658.htm#fr_876) See [p. 310](sbe2649.htm#page_310), note\n[1](sbe2649.htm#fn_747).\n\n[374:4](sbe2658.htm#fr_877) The vira _g_ consists of padas of ten syllables.\nFor the same speculation, see II, 5, I, 20.\n\n[376:1](sbe2658.htm#fr_878) ?
