(The vidyas are) separate, on account of the difference of words and the\nlike.\n\nIn the preceding adhikara _n_ a we have arrived at the conclusion that a\nmeditation on Vai _s_ vanara as a whole is the pre-eminent meaning of the\ntext, although special results are stated for meditations on Sute _g_ as and\nso on. On the ground of this it may be presumed that other meditations also\nwhich are enjoined by separate scriptural texts have to be combined into more\ngeneral meditations. Moreover, we cannot acknowledge a separation of vidyas\n(acts of cognition; meditations) as long as the object of cognition is the\nsame; for the object constitutes the character of a cognition in the same way\nas the material offered and the divinity to which the offering is made\nconstitute the character of a sacrifice. Now we understand that the Lord forms\nthe only object of cognition in a number of scriptural passages, although the\nlatter are separate in enunciation; cp. e.g. 'He consisting of mind, whose\nbody is pra _n_ a' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 2); 'Brahman is Ka, Brahman is Kha' (\n_Kh_. Up. IV, 10, 5); 'He whose wishes are true, whose purposes are true' (\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 3). Analogously one and the same Pra _n_ a is referred to\nin different texts; cp. 'Pra _n_ a indeed is the end of all' ( _Kh_. Up. IV,\n3, 3); 'Pra _n_ a indeed is the oldest and the best' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 1, 1);\n'Pra _n_ a is father, Pra _n_ a is mother' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 15, 1). And from\nthe unity of the object of cognition there follows unity of cognition. Nor\n\np. 278\n\ncan it be said that, on this view, the separateness of the different\nscriptural statements would be purposeless, since each text serves to set\nforth other qualities (of the one pradhana which is their common subject).\nHence the different qualities which are enjoined in one's own and in other _S_\nakhas, and which all belong to one object of knowledge, must be combined so\nthat a totality of cognition may be effected.\n\nTo this conclusion we reply, 'Separate,' &c. Although the object of cognition\nis one, such cognitions must be considered as separate 'on account of the\ndifference of words and the like.'--For the text exhibits a difference of\nwords such as 'he knows,' 'let him meditate,' 'let him form the idea' (cp.\n_Kh_. Up. III, 14, 1). And difference of terms is acknowledged as a reason of\ndifference of acts, according to Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras II, 2, 1.--The\nclause 'and the like' in the Sutra intimates that also qualities and so on may\nbe employed, according to circumstances, as reasons for the separateness of\nacts.--But, an objection is raised, from passages such as 'he knows' and so on\nwe indeed apprehend a difference of words, but not a difference of sense such\nas we apprehend when meeting with such clauses as 'he sacrifices' and the like\n(ya _g_ ate, _g_ uhoti, dadati). For all these words (viz. veda, upasita, &c.)\ndenote one thing only, viz. a certain activity of the mind, and another\nmeaning is not possible in their case 1. How then does difference of vidya\nfollow from difference of words?--This objection is without force, we reply;\nfor although all those words equally denote a certain activity of the mind\nonly, yet a difference of vidya may result from a difference of connexion. The\nLord indeed is the only object of meditation in the passages quoted, but\naccording to its general purport each passage teaches different qualities of\nthe Lord; and similarly, although one and the same Pra _n_ a is the object of\nmeditation in the other series\n\np. 279\n\nof passages, yet one of his qualities has to be meditated upon in one place\nand another in another place. From difference of connexion there thus follows\ndifference of injunction, and from the latter we apprehend the separateness of\nthe vidyas. Nor can it be maintained (as the purvapakshin did) that one of\nthose injunctions is the injunction of the vidya itself, while the others\nenjoin mere qualities; for there is no determining reason (as to which is the\nvidyavidhi and which the gu _n_ avidhis), and as in each passage more than one\nquality are mentioned it is impossible that those passages should enjoin\nqualities with reference to a vidya established elsewhere 1. Nor should, in\nthe case of the purvapakshin's view being the true one, the qualities which\nare common to several passages, such as 'having true wishes,' be repeated more\nthan once. Nor can the different sections be combined into one syntactical\nwhole, because in each one a certain kind of meditation is enjoined on those\nwho have a certain wish, whence we understand that the passage is complete in\nitself 2. Nor is there in the present case an additional injunction of a\nmeditation on something whole--such as there is in the case of the cognition\nof the Vai _s_ vanara--owing to the force of which the meditations on the\nsingle parts which are contained in each section would combine themselves into\na whole. And if on the ground of the object of cognition being one we should\nadmit unity of vidya without any restriction, we should thereby admit an\naltogether impossible combination of all qualities (mentioned anywhere in the\nUpanishads). The Sutra therefore rightly declares the separateness of the\nvidyas.--The present adhikara _n_ a being thus settled, the first Sutra of the\npada has now to be considered  3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[278:1](sbe38201.htm#fr_175) Vedopasitetyadi _s_ abdana _m_ kva _k_ i _g_ _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ ana _m_ kva _k_ id dhyanam ity arthabhedam a _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nanasyavidheyatvad vidhiyamanam upasanam evety aha arthantareti. \xc3\x82n.
