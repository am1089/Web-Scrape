Again Sampati spoke,  \nAnd hope in every breast awoke:  \n'Though lost my wings, and strength decayed,  \nYet shall my words lend Rama aid.  \nI know the worlds where Vishnu trod, 1b  \nI know the realm of Ocean's God;  \nHow Asurs fought with heavenly foes,  \nAnd Amrit from the churning rose. 2b  \nA mighty task before me lies,  \nTo prosper Rama's enterprise,  \nA task too hard for one whom length  \nOf days has rifled of his strength.  \nI saw the cruel Ravan bear  \nA gentle lady through the air.  \nBright washer form, and fresh and young,  \nAnd sparkling gems about her hung.  \n'O Rama, Rama!' cried the dame,  \nAnd shrieked in terror Lakshman's name,  \nAs, struggling in the giant's hold,  \nShe dropped her gauds of gems and gold.  \nLike sun-light on a mountain shone  \nThe silken garments she had on,  \nAnd glistened o'er his swarthy form  \nAs lightning flashes through the storm.  \nThat giant Ravan, famed of old,  \nIs brother of the Lord of Gold. 3b  \nThe southern ocean roars and swells  \nRound Lanka, where the robber dwells  \nIn his fair city nobly planned  \nAnd built by Vis'vakarma's 4b hand.  \nWithin his bower securely barred,  \nWith monsters round her for a guard,  \nStill in her silken vesture clad  \nLies Sita, and her heart is sad.  \nA hundred leagues your course must be  \nBeyond this margin of the sea.  \nStill to the south your way pursue,  \nAnd there the giant Ravan view.  \nThen up, O Vanars, and away!  \nFor by my heavenly lore I say,  \nThere will you see the lady's face.  \nAnd hither soon your steps retrace.  \nIn the first field of air are borne  \nThe doves and birds that feed on corn.  \nThe second field supports the crows  \nAnd birds whose food on branches grows.  \nAlong the third in balanced flight  \nSail the keen osprey and the kite.  \nSwift through the fourth the falcon springs  \nThe fifth the slower vulture wings.  \nUp to the sixth the gay swans rise,  \n\np. 388  \n\nWhere royal Vainateya  [1](ry334.htm#fn_772) flies.  \nWe too, O chiefs, of vulture race,  \nOur line from Vinata may trace,  \nCondemned, because we wrought a deed  \nOf shame, on flesh and blood to feed.  \nBut all Suparna's  [2](ry334.htm#fn_773) wondrous powers  \nAnd length of keenest sight are ours,  \nThat we a hundred leagues away  \nThrough fields of air descry our prey.  \nNow from this spot my gazing eye  \nCan Ravan and the dame descry.  \nDevise some plan to overleap  \nThis barrier of the briny deep.  \nFind the Videhan lady there,  \nAnd joyous to your home repair.  \nMe too, O Vanars. to the side  \nOf Varun's  [3](ry334.htm#fn_774) home the ocean, guide,  \nWhere due libations shall be paid  \nTo my great-hearted brother's shade.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[387:1](ry333.htm#fr_767) Vritra, 'the coverer, hider, obstructer (of rain)'\nis the name of the Vedic personification of an imaginary malignant influence\nor demon of darkness and drought supposed to take possession of the clouds,\ncausing them to obstruct the clearness of the sky and keep back the waters.\nIndra is represented as battling with this evil influence, and the pent-up\nclouds being practically represented as mountains or castles are shattered by\nhis thunderbolt and made to open their receptacle.\n\n[387:1b](ry333.htm#fr_768) Frequent mention has been made of the three steps\nof Vishnu typifying the rising, culmination, and setting of the sun.\n\n[387:2b](ry333.htm#fr_769) For the _Churning of the Sea_ , see Book I, Canto\nXLV.\n\n[387:3b](ry333.htm#fr_770) Kuvera, the God of Wealth.\n\n[387:4b](ry333.htm#fr_771) The Architect of the Gods.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LIX.: Sampati's Story.](ry334.htm)\n\n"
