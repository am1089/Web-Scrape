Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Child! When you have got your senses controlled\nand have overcome lust, anger, etc., and other enemies, then you are certainly\nentitled to hear this secret. While Brahma was discussing on this subject with\nMarichi and the other Brahmar _s_ is and with Svayambhuva Manu, suddenly there\ncame out of the nose of the meditative Brahma, one young boar (the child of a\nboar) of the dimension of one finger only. That little boar, that was just in\nthe air, soon became, while they were looking at it, enlarged to a very big\nelephant, in an instant; a very strange sight, indeed! Seeing this, the\nKumaras Sanaka, etc., Marichi and the other Seven Ri _s_ is, and the Creator\nBrahma were struck with wonder and Brahma began to discuss thus :-- Oh! This\nyoung boar has come out suddenly of My nose; though it is a very small one, it\nis certainly, come under a disguise and it has all made us merge\n\n\n\np. 745\n\n\n\nin an ocean of wonder. Is this something Divine, of a Sattvic quality under\nthe guise of this boar? It was of the size of a thumb and it is now like the\nHimalaya Mountain? Oh! Is this the Bhagavan, the Yaj\xc3\xb1a Puru _s_ a? While they\nwere thus discussing, the Bhagavan, in the shape of the boar, began to make\nloud sounds, like the rolling of the mountain clouds at the time of the\nPralaya resounding all the quarters. At this Brahma and all the Ri _s_ is\nassembled there became very glad. Hearing the ghurghura noise of the Boar,\ntheir troubles ended and the people of Janarloka, Taparloka, Satyaloka and all\nthe Devas being very much gladdened began to chant sweet hymns with Chha _n_\ndas of Rik, Yajus, Sama and Atharva Vedas, to that \xc3\x82di Puru _s_ a, the\nBhagavan, from all sides.\n\n\n\n11-20. Hearing their praises, the Bhagavan Hari graciously looked on them and\nimmediately merged Himself in the ocean. The ocean was very much agitated with\nthe fierce striking of the hairs of the Boar, when He entered into the waters,\nand spoke thus :-- \xc2\x93O Deva ! O Thou, the destroyer of the afflictions of your\nrefuges! Protect me.\xc2\x94 Hearing the words of the ocean, the God Hari tore\nasunder all the aquatic animals and went down beneath the waters. Searching\nviolently hither and thither, He knew the earth by her smell. At once the\nBhagavan Hari, the Lord of all, went to Her and rescued the earth by raising\nHer up on his big teeth, the Earth that was the abode of all the beings. When\nthe Bhagavan, the Lord of all the sacrifices, came up with the Earth on the\ntop of His teeth, He looked beautiful like the elephant of a quarter taking\nout by the root and holding a thousand petalled lotus upon his tusks. When the\nBhagavan rescued thus the Earth, raising Her up on His tusks, Brahma and\nIndra, the Lord of the Devas, the powerful Manu began praise to Him with sweet\nwords :-- Brahma said :-- O Lotus-eyed! O Bhagavan! Thou art victorious\neverywhere; O Thou, the Destroyer of the sufferings of the Bhaktas! Thou hast,\nby Thy own prowess, humiliated the Heaven, the abode of the gods upto\nSatyaloka! Thou, the Giver all the desires! O Deva! This earth shines so\nbeautiful on Thy teeth as the thousand petalled lotus, taken up by the root by\na mad elephant, shines on his two tusks. O Bhagavan! This Form, i. e., that of\nThy sacrificial Boar, with earth on Thee looks so very beautiful as the lotus\nlooks beautiful on the tusks of an elephant.\n\n\n\n21-22. O Lord! We bow down to Thee, the Creator and the Destroyer of\neverything; Thou assumest many forms for the purpose of destroying the\nDanavas; Thou dost do many acts that redound to Thy Glory, We bow down to\nThee, to Thy Front and to Thy Back. (Really thou hast no front nor back. Thou\nart everywhere.) Thou art the Upholder of all the Celestials and the\nImmortals! Thy eyes shine equally everywhere.\n\n\n\np. 746\n\n\n\n23-25. O Deva! By Thy power I am brought up and engaged in the work of\ncreation and by Thy order I create in every Kalpa this Universe and destroy\nit. O Lord of Immortals! In the ancient times the Devas united churned the\nvast ocean by Thy help and got according to their merits their due shares. O\nHari! Indra, the Lord of the Devas is enjoying the vast kingdom of Heaven, the\nTrilokas, by Thy Will and appointment. All the Devas worship him.\n\n\n\n26-27. So the God of Fire has got his burning power and is residing in the\nbellies of the Devas, the Asuras, men and all other beings and penetrating\ntheir bellies, is satisfying all. Yama, the King of Dharma, by Thy\nappointment, is the Lord of the southern quarters, is presiding over the\nPitris and being the witness of all the actions of the Jivas, is awarding duly\nto them the fruits thereof.\n\n\n\n28-33. Nai _rr_ ita, the Lord of the Rak _s_ asas, the witness of all the\nactions of all the beings, by Thy commandment, is the destroyer of all the\nobstacles of the devotees that take refuge unto thee, though he is a Yak _s_\na. The Varu _n_ a Deva, by Thy order, has become duly the Lord of the waters,\nand the Regent of the Loka (Dikpala). The Vayu, the Life of all, the carrier\nof the smell, has become by Thy order Lokapala and the Guru of the universe.\nKuvera, obedient to Thy order, has become the Lord of the Yak _s_ as and the\nKinnaras and is holding a respectful position like other Lokapalas. \xc3\x8es'ana,\nWho is the destroyer of all the Jivas, has got his Lordship over a quarter by\nThy order and is being praised by all the Rudras, the Devas, Gandharbas, Yak\n_s_ as, Kinnaras, the men and all the beings. O Bhagavan! We bow down to Thee,\nthe Lord of the Universe; the innumerable Devas that are seen are merely the\nsmall fractions of Thy powers.\n\n\n\n34-38. Naraya _n_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Child Narada! When Brahma, the Creator and the\nGrandsire of the Lokas, praised thus the \xc3\x82di Puru _s_ a Bhagavan, He cast a\nside long glance at them, offering His Grace. When the Bhagavan, the\nSacrificial Boar, was coming up with earth, rescued and placed on his teeth,\nthe awful Hira _n_ yaksa, the chief of the Daityas came before Him and\nobstructed His passage when He killed him by one violent stroke of his club.\nHe was besmeared all over his body with the blood of the Daitya; and thus He\ncame up from the Rasatala and placed the earth on the waters. He then went\naway to His Vaiku _nt_ ha abode.\n\n\n\nO Child Narada! He who hears or reads devotedly this glorious deed of the\nBhagavan and the deliverance of the Earth, will certainly be freed of all his\nsins and goes to the highest holiest place of Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of all.\nThere is no doubt in this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Second Chapter of the Eighth Book on the uplifting of the Earth\nby the Sacrificial Boar in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3](bk08ch03.htm)\n\n"
