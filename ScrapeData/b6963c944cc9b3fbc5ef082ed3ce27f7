Like the latter, it is the work of a teacher of the\nBlack Ya _g_ ur-veda, who composed manuals on all the various subdivisions of\nthe Kalpa, and founded a Sutra- _k_ ara _n_ a, which is said to exist to the\npresent day 1. The Brahmanical tradition, too, acknowledges these facts, and,\ninstead of surrounding Baudhayana\'s work with a halo of myths, simply states\nthat it was originally studied by and authoritative for the followers of the\nTaittiriya-veda alone, and later only became one of the sources of the Sacred\nLaw for all Brahmans 2. Moreover, the position of Baudhayana among the\nteachers of the Ya _g_ ur-veda is well defined, and his home, or at least the\nhome of his school, is known. But here the resemblance stops. For while the\nSutras of \xc3\x82pastamba-and Hira _n_ yake _s_ in have been preserved in care-fully\nand methodically arranged collections, where a certain place is assigned to\neach section of the Kalpa, no complete set of the Sutras of Baudhayana\'s\nschool has, as yet; been found, and the original position of the detached\nportions which are obtainable is not quite certain. Again, while the works of\n\xc3\x82pastamba and Hira _n_ yake _s_ in seem to have been kept free from extensive\ninterpolations, several parts of\n\np. xxx\n\n[paragraph continues] Baudhayana\'s Sutras have clearly received considerable\nadditions from later hands.\n\nAccording to the researches of Dr. A. Burnell 1, whose long residence in\nSouthern India and intimate acquaintance with its Brahmanical libraries have\nmade him the first authority on the literature of the schools of the\nTaittiriya-veda, the Sutras of Baudhayana consist of six sections, viz. 1. the\n_S_ rauta-sutras, probably in nineteen Pra _s_ nas; 2. The Karmanta-sutra in\ntwenty Adhyayas; 3. The Dvaidha-sutra in four Pra _s_ nas; 4. The G _ri_ hya-\nsutra in four Pra _s_ nas; 5. The Dharma-sutra in four Pra _s_ nas; 6. The _S_\nulva-sutra in three Adhyayas. The results of the search for Sanskrit MSS. in\nother parts of India, and especially in Western India, do not differ\nmaterially from those obtained by Dr. Burnell. The G _ri_ hya-sutra, which in\nWestern India occasionally bears the title Smarta-sutra 2, contains, however,\nnine instead of four Pra _s_ nas. The MSS. of the Baudhayana-sutras, which\ncontain the text alone, are all incomplete, mostly very corrupt and in bad\norder, and rarely give more than a small number of Pra _s_ nas on detached\nsubjects. The copies in which the text is accompanied by a commentary are in a\nbetter condition. Thus the Kalpavivara _n_ a of Bhavasvamin 3 extends over the\nwhole of the _S_ rauta-sutra, and over the Karmanta and the Dvaidha-sutras. It\nshows the proper sequence of the Pra _s_ nas on _S_ rauta sacrifices, and that\nprobably the Karmanta and the Dvaidha immediately followed the _S_ rauta-\nsutra. But there is no hint in the MSS. or in the commentaries how the G _ri_\nhya, Dharma, and _S_ ulva-sutras were originally placed. With respect to these\nsections, it is only possible to judge from the analogy of the other extant\nsets of Kalpa-sutras\n\np. xxxi\n\nand from internal evidence. On these grounds it may be shown that the order,\nadopted by Dr. Burnell, is probably the correct one. For the beginning of the\nG _ri_ hya-sutra 1 shows by its wording that it was not a separate treatise,\nbut was immediately connected with some preceding Pra _s_ na. The analogy of\nthe collections of the \xc3\x82pastambiyas, the Haira _n_ yake _s_ as, the Ka _th_\nas, and other schools permits us to infer that it stood after the _S_ rauta-\nsutra. It is further clear that, in its turn, it was succeeded by the Dharma-\nsutra. For two passages of the latter work, 1, 2, 3, 15, and II, 8, 15, 9,\nclearly contain references to the G _ri_ hya-sutra. In the former, the author\ngives the rule regarding the length of the staff to be carried by a student,\nas well as the general principle that the staff must be cut from a tree fit\nfor sacrificial purposes. With respect to the latter clause he adds that the\ndetails have been given above.\' As the Dharma-sutra contains nothing more on\nthis subject, it follows that the expression \'above\' must refer to G _ri_ hya-\nsutra II, 7, where the usual detailed rules regarding the employment of\nparticular woods for the several var _n_ as are given. In the second passage\nBaudhayana says that the rules for the performance of funeral sacrifices have\nbeen fully explained in the section on the Ash _t_ akahoma, which occurs G\n_ri_ hya-sutra II, 17-18. It is, therefore, perfectly certain that Baudhayana,\njust like \xc3\x82pastamba, placed the Pra _s_ nas on the Sacred Law after those on\nthe domestic ceremonies, and that the Dharma-sutra was not a separate work.\nUnder these circumstances it becomes highly probable that the _S_ ulva-sutra\nformed, as is the case in other sets of Kalpa-sutras, the conclusion of the\nwhole. Thus the only treatise, whose position remains doubtful, is the\nPravarakha _n_ _d_ a, the list of the Brahmanical gotras and of their deified\nancestors 2. Possibly it may have stood at the end of the _S_ rauta-sutra.\n\np. xxxii\n\nThe destruction of the continuity of Baudhayana\'s Kalpa-sutra has had the\nconsequence which is commonly observable in other dismembered works, that\nseveral of its detached portions have received considerable additions from\nlater and, as it would seem, from several hands. There can be no doubt that a\nsmall portion only of the nine Pra _s_ nas, found in the Western copies of the\nG _ri_ hya-sutra, really belongs to Baudhayana. For the description of the G\n_ri_ hya rites, which strictly follows the general plan laid down in the first\nSutra, is completed in two or three Pra _s_ nas 1. Next follows a Pra _s_ na\non the anuk _ri_ tis, rites resembling those comprised in the subdivisions\ntreated before, and then a Pra _s_ na on praya _s_ _k_ ittas, or expiations of\nmistakes committed during, and of the neglect of, the performance of the G\n_ri_ hya-karma _n_ i. The remaining Pra _s_ nas are filled with a medley of\nparibhashas, general rules, and of full descriptions of ceremonies, some of\nwhich have been given before, while others are added afresh. Many of the\nnewly-added rites do not belong to the ancient Brahmanical worship, but to the\nPauranic religions, the service of _S_ iva, Skanda, Naraya _n_ a, and other\ndeities, and some show an admixture of Tantric elements. In some of the later\nPra _s_ nas, especially IV and V, the language closely resembles that of the\nfirst three, and shows the same stereotyped phrases and the same Vedic\nanomalous forms. But in other sections, particularly VI-IX, we find, instead\nof Sutras, the common Anush _t_ ubh _S_ loka throughout, and expressions\npeculiar to the metrical Sm _ri_ tis and the Pura _n_ as. At the end of most\nAdhyayas we read the phrase, ity aha Baudhayana _h_ , or bhagavan Baudhayana\n_h_ , \'thus speaks Baudhayana, or the divine Baudhayana.\' Finally, while the\nfirst three Pra _s_ nas are divided into Ka _n_ _d_ ikas or Kha _n_ _d_ as,\nthe following ones consist of Adhyayas or chapters. These differences, as well\nas the fact that the most important G _ri_ hya rites, arranged according to a\nspecial plan, are done with in the\n\np. xxxiii\n\nfirst three Pra _s_ nas, necessarily lead to the conclusion that the whole\nremainder does not belong to Baudhayana, but consists of so-called Pari _s_\nish _t_ as, which were composed by the adherents of his school. Further, the\nfact that the last six Pra _s_ nas do not show everywhere the same style and\nlanguage, makes it probable that the additions were made at different times\nand by different persons.\n\nThe Dharma-sutra seems to have undergone exactly the same fate as the G _ri_\nhya-sutra. It will be obvious even to the readers of the translation that its\nfourth Pra _s_ na is a later addition. It consists of two parts. The first,\nwhich ends with the fourth Adhyaya, treats of penances, both public and secret\nones. The second, Adhyayas 5-8, describes the means of obtaining siddhi, the\nfulfilment of one\'s desires, and recommends for this purpose the offering of\nthe Ga _n_ ahomas after a previous sanctification of the worshipper by means\nof a course of austerities. The first part is perfectly superfluous, as the\nsubject of penances has already been discussed in the first sections of the\nsecond Pra _s_ na, and again in chapters 4-10 of the third Pra _s_ na. Its\nrules sometimes contradict those given before, and in other cases, e _g_. IV,\n2, 10-12, are mere repetitions of previous statements. The introduction of the\nmeans of gaining siddhi, on the other hand, is without a parallel in other\nDharma-sutras, and the subject is entirely foreign to the scope of such works.\nIts treatment, too, shows that chapters 5-8 do not belong to the author of the\nbulk of the Dharma-sutra. For the description of the preparatory \'restraints\'\nor austerities contains somewhat more detailed rules for a number of penances,\ne.g. the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ras and the _K_ andraya _n_ a, which have already\nbeen described in the preceding Pra _s_ nas. Moreover, the style and the\nlanguage of the whole fourth Pra _s_ na are very different from those of the\nthree preceding ones, and the differences observable are exactly the same as\nthose between the first five and the last four Pra _s_ nas of the G _ri_ hya-\nsutra. The epic _S_ loka nearly throughout replaces the aphoristic prose, and\nthe common slipshod Sanskrit of the Pura _n_ as appears instead of the archaic\nforms. Finally, the fourth Pra _s_ na is divided into\n\np. xxxiv\n\n[paragraph continues] Adhyayas, not into the Ka _n_ _d_ ikas or Kha _n_ _d_ as\nand Adhyayas which are found in the first two Pra _s_ nas.\n\nThis latter peculiarity is also observable in the third Pra _s_ na, and raises\na suspicion against the genuineness of that part also. For, though the third\nPra _s_ na in style and language resembles the first two, it is hard to\nbelieve that the author should, for no apparent reason, suddenly have changed\nthe manner of dividing his work towards its end. This suspicion is further\nstrengthened by two other circumstances. First, Pra _s_ nas I-II really\nexhaust the discussion of the whole Dharma, and the third offers supplementary\ninformation only on some points which have been touched upon previously.\nSecondly, several Adhyayas of Pra _s_ na III seem to have been borrowed from\nother works, or to be abstracts from them. Thus the tenth chapter has\ncertainly been taken from the Gautamiya Dharma _s_ astra, the sixth bears a\nvery close and suspicious resemblance to Vish _n_ u XLVIII 1, and the third\nlooks very much like a short summary of the doctrine of Vikhanas, whose lost\nSutra contained the original rule of the order of the Vaikhanasas or hermits,\nliving in the forest. These circumstances justify, it seems to me, the\nassumption that Baudhayana\'s original Dharma-sutra consisted, like\n\xc3\x82pastamba\'s, of two Pra _s_ nas only, and that it received, through followers\nof his school, two separate additions, first in very ancient times Pra _s_ na\nIII, where the style of the master is strictly followed, and later Pra _s_ na\nIV, where the language and phraseology of the metrical Sm _ri_ tis are\nadopted. It ought to be noted that Govindasvamin, too, does not take the whole\nof the four Pra _s_ nas for Baudhayana\'s composition. With respect to several\npassages 2 where Baudhayana\'s name is introduced in order to give weight to\nthe rules, he says that the Sutras may belong to \'a pupil.\' I do not think\nthat the criterion which he uses can be relied on in every case, because\noriental authors without doubt occasionally speak of themselves as of third\n\np. xxxv\n\npersons. But the fact that the commentator, though an orthodox Hindu, had\nmisgivings as to the genuineness of portions of the work, is not without\nsignificance. It seems also that even the first two Pra _s_ nas are not quite\nfree from interpolations. Thus the Ka _n_ _d_ ikas on the Tarpa _n_ a 1 are\ncertainly much enlarged by additions, the verse at I, 5, 11, 36, a repetition\nof I, 5, 9, 5, and some prose quotations which are introduced by the words\nathapy udaharanti, \'now they quote also,\' standing usually before verses only,\nare at least suspicious. That the genuineness of many single passages should\nbe doubtful, is no more than might be expected, not only on account of the\nseparation of the Dharma-sutra from the other parts of the Kalpa, but also\nbecause the work, as we shall see further on, remained for a long time without\nthe protection of a commentary. The practical conclusion to be drawn from this\nstate of things is that the greatest caution must be observed in using the\nBaudhayana Dharma-sutra for historical purposes, and that it will be advisable\nto draw no inferences regarding Baudhayana\'s relation to other teachers and\nschools from the last two Pra _s_ nas, and not to trust too much to historical\ninferences drawn from single passages of the first two.\n\nThe position which Baudhayana occupies among the teachers of the Taittiriya-\nveda has already been discussed in the Introduction to \xc3\x82pastamba. It has been\nshown that according to the Brahmanical tradition preserved by Mahadeva, the\ncommentator of the Hira _n_ yake _s_ i-sutras, he composed the first Sutra for\nthe followers of his _S_ akha. Internal and external evidence has also been\nadduced, proving that he certainly was more ancient than \xc3\x82pastamba and Hira\n_n_ yake _s_ in. It is now possible to bring forward some further facts\nbearing on these points. First, in the section on the Tarpa _n_ a, the\nlibations of water offered to various deities, _Ri_ shis, and the manes, II,\n5, 9, 14, Ka _n_ va Baudhayana receives his share immediately after the _Ri_\nshis of the Veda and before \xc3\x82pastamba, the Sutrakara, and\n\np. xxxvi\n\n[paragraph continues] Satyasha _dh_ a Hira _n_ yake _s_ in. The same order is\nobserved in the distribution of the offerings at the Sarpabali, described in\nthe G _ri_ hya-sutra 1, where the following teachers of the Ya _g_ ur-veda are\nspecially named, viz. Vai _s_ ampayana, Phuli\xe1\xb9\x85gu, Tittiri, Ukha, Aukhya,\n\xc3\x82treya the author of the Pada-text, Kau _n_ _d_ inya the author of the\ncommentary, Ka _n_ va Baudhayana the author of the Prava _k_ ana, \xc3\x82pastamba\nthe author of the Sutra, and Satyasha _dh_ a Hira _n_ yake _s_ in. Neither of\nthese two passages belongs to Baudhayana. They are both clearly\ninterpolations. But they show that Mahadeva\'s statement, which makes\nBaudhayana the first expounder of the Kalpa among the Taittiriyavedins, agrees\nwith the tradition of the Baudhayaniyas themselves. For not only the place\nallotted to Baudhayana\'s name, but still more the title Prava _k_ anakara\nwhich he receives, show that the followers of his school placed him before and\nabove all other teachers of the ritual. The term prava _k_ ana, which\nliterally means \'proclaiming or recitation,\' has frequently the technical\nsense of \'oral instruction,\' and is applied both to the traditional lore\ncontained in the Brahma _n_ as, and to the more systematic teaching of the\nA\xe1\xb9\x85gas 2. If, therefore, a teacher is called the author of the Prava _k_ ana of\na _S_ akha, that can only mean that he is something more than a common\nSutrakara, and is considered to be the originator of the whole \'system of\ninstruction among its followers. The epithet Ka _n_ va, which Baudhayana\nreceives in both the passages quoted above, indicates that he belonged to the\nVedic Gotra of the Ka _n_ vas. It deserves to be noted that Govindasvamin,\ntoo, on I, 3, 5, 13, explains the name Baudhayana by Ka _n_ vayana 3.\n\np. xxxvii\n\nThe style of Baudhayana\'s works furnishes, as Dr. Burnell has pointed out 1,\nanother argument for their high antiquity. Compared with the Sutras of\n\xc3\x82pastamba and Hira _n_ yake _s_ in they are much simpler in their arrangement,\nand the complete absence of that anxiety to save \'half a vowel\' which\ncharacterises the fully developed Sutra-style is very remarkable. The last\npoint has been noticed by Govindasvamin also. In commenting on I, 2, 3, 17-18,\nwhere Baudhayana first permits students to beg food of men of all castes, and\nafterwards explains that he means \xc3\x82ryans who follow their lawful occupations,\nhe says 2, \'(If anybody should ask), "Why give two Sutras, while one Sutra,\n(\'A student shall ask) \xc3\x82ryans who follow their lawful occupations,\' would have\nsufficed?" (his objection will be) correct. For this teacher is not\nparticularly anxious to make his book short.\' In other cases we find a certain\nawkwardness in the distribution of the subject matter, which probably finds\nits explanation through the fact that Baudhayana first attempted to- bring the\nteaching of the Taittiriyas on the Dharma into a systematic form. Thus the\nrules on the law of inheritance are given without any apparent necessity and\nagainst the custom of the other Sutrakaras in two different chapters, I, 5,\n11, 9-16 and II, 2, 3, 1-44. The section on purification, too, is divided into\ntwo separate portions, I, 4, 6-10 and I, 6, 13-15, and the second which treats\nof the purification of the vessels at sacrifices, properly ought to have been\nplaced into the _S_ rauta-sutra, not into the Dharma-sutra. Again, the\ndiscussion of several topics is repeatedly interrupted by the introduction of\nrules belonging to different subjects, and Govindasvamin\'s ingenuity is often\ntaxed to the utmost in order to find the reason why certain Sutras which\napparently\n\np. xxxviii\n\nare unconnected with the main subject have been inserted. A third argument for\nthe great antiquity of Baudhayana\'s Sutras, derived from the archaic character\nof some of his doctrines, has been discussed in the Introduction to \xc3\x82pastamba\n1. The number of instances where Baudhayana\'s rules are based on a more\nancient order of ideas than \xc3\x82pastamba\'s might be increased very considerably.\nBut, as now the comparison of the two works is open to all students, I omit\nthe cases contained in the two Dharma-sutras, and content myself with adducing\none more from the less accessible G _ri_ hya-sutras. It is a well-known fact\nthat the ancient Vedic ritual in certain cases admitted _S_ udras, and\nparticularly the Rathakara or carpenter, who, according to all accounts, has\n_S_ udra blood in his veins, to a participation in the _S_ rauta rites. The\nTaittiriya-brahma _n_ a even gives certain Mantras to be recited by the\nRathakara at the Agnyadhana sacrifice 2. Now Baudhayana, who, Dh. S. I, 9, 17,\n6, derives the origin of the Rathakaras from a Vai _s_ ya male and _S_ udra\nfemale, apparently reckons him amongst the twice-born, and explicitly allows\nhim to receive the sacrament of the initiation. He says, G _ri_ hya-sutra II,\n5, 8-9, \'Let him initiate a Brahma _n_ a in spring; a Kshatriya in summer, a\nVai _s_ ya in autumn, a Rathakara in the rainy season; or all of them in\nspring 3.\' But \xc3\x82pastamba, who shows great hostility against the mixed castes,\nand emphatically denies the right of _S_ udras to be initiated, gives the same\nrule regarding the seasons for the initiation both in his G _ri_ hya and\nDharma-sutras 4. He, however, omits the Rathakara in both cases. There can be\nno doubt that \xc3\x82pastamba\'s exclusion of the carpenter, which agrees with the\nsentiments prevailing in modern Brahmanical society, is an off-shoot of a\nlater doctrine, and as both he and Baudhayana\n\np. xxxix\n\nbelong to the same vidyava _m_ sa, or spiritual family, this difference may be\nused as an argument for his posteriority to Baudhayana. In connexion with this\nrule of Baudhayana\'s it ought to be mentioned that even in the present day\ncertain subdivisions of the modern Sutars or carpenters actually wear the\nBrahmanical thread, and, in spite of the adverse teaching of the _S_ astras,\nfind Brahmans willing to perform the ceremony of investiture for them.\n\nWhile it thus appears not incredible that Baudhayana really was the first\nSutrakara of the Taittiriyas, the numerous quotations which his works contain,\npermit us to form an idea of the extent of the Vedic and profane literature\nknown to him. Among the Vedic works which he adduces as authorities, or\notherwise refers to, the three sections of the Taittiriya-veda, the Sa _m_\nhita, the Brahma _n_ a, and the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, naturally take the first place.\nFor the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka he seems to have used the Andhra version, as Dh. S. II,\n10, 18, 7, 11 references to the seventy-first Anuvaka of the tenth Prapa _th_\naka occur. Two long passages, Dh. S. I, 2, 4, 3-8; II, 6, 11, 1-8, which\napparently have been taken from the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a, testify to his\nacquaintance with the White Ya _g_ ur-veda. Baudhayana does not say expressly\nthat he quotes from the Brahma _n_ a of the Va _g_ asaneyins, but Govinda has\nno hesitation in pointing to the _S_ atapatha as their source. It is\nremarkable that the fact noticeable in \xc3\x82pastamba\'s quotation from the _S_\natapatha reappears here, and that the wording of the two quotations does not\nfully agree with the printed text of the Brahma _n_ a. The differences in the\nfirst passage are, no doubt, partly owing to corruptions and interpolations in\nBaudhayana\'s text; but that cannot be said of the second 1. References to the\nSama-veda and the Samans occur repeatedly, and the passage from the Nidana of\nBhallavins regarding the geographical extent of true Brahmanical\n\np. xl\n\nlearning, which Vasish _th_ a adduces, is given I, 1, 2, 11-12. From the Rig-\nveda a few expiatory hymns and verses, such as the Aghamarsha _n_ a and the\nTaratsamandis, are quoted. The Atharva-veda is not referred to by name, but\nthe existence of \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a schools may be inferred from the mention made\nof the vows called _S_ iras, II, 8, 14, 2. Among the authorities on the Sacred\nLaw, mentioned in the Dharma-sutra, Katya I, 2, 3, 46, Maudgalya II, 2, 4, 8,\nand Aupa _g_ andhani II, 2, 3,33, do not occur in other works of the same\nclass 1. Harita, who is mentioned II, 1, 2, 21, and who probably was a teacher\nof the Maitraya _n_ iya school, is named by Vasish _th_ a and \xc3\x82pastamba also.\nThe Gautama who is quoted I, 1, 2, 7 and II, 2, 4, 17, is, as has been shown\nin the Introduction to Gautama, most probably the author of the still existing\nInstitutes of Gautama. To the arguments for the latter view, adduced there, I\nmay add that two other passages of the Dharma-sutra, II, 6, 15 and 26, point\nto a close connexion between Baudhayana\'s and Gautama\'s works. The former of\nthe two Sutras contains, with the exception of one small clause in the\nbeginning, exactly the same description of the duties of a hermit in the\nforest as that given by Gautama III, 26-35. The second Sutra states, just as\nGautama\'s rule III, 36, that the venerable teacher (a _k_ arya _h_ )\nprescribes one order only, that of the householders. The reason given for this\nopinion differs, however, according to Baudhayana, from that adduced in\nGautama\'s text. The almost literal identity of the first long passage makes it\nnot improbable that Baudhayana borrowed in this instance also from Gautama\nwithout noting the source from which he drew. On the other hand, the argument\ndrawn from the fact that the tenth Adhyaya of Pra _s_ na III has been taken\nfrom Gautama\'s Sutra loses its force since, as I have shown above, it is\nimprobable that the third Pra _s_ na formed part of Baudhayana\'s\n\np. xli\n\noriginal work. A metrical work on the Sacred Law seems to be quoted II, 2, 4,\n14-15. For, as the second verse, adduced there, says that the penance for one\nwho violated his Guru\'s bed has been declared above, it seems impossible to\nassume that the two _S_ lokas belonged to the versified maxims of the Dharma\ncurrent among the learned Brahmans. If this quotation is not an interpolation,\nit proves that, side by side with the Dharma-sutras, metrical treatises on the\nSacred Law existed in very early times 1. One quotation, finally, which gives\na verse from the dialogue of the daughters of U _s_ anas and V _ri_ shaparvan\nseems to have been taken from an epic poem. The verse is actually found in the\nMahabharata I, 78, 10, and again 34, where the altercation between Sarmish\n_th_ a and Devayani forms part of the Yayatyupakhyana. Considering what has\nbeen said above regarding the state of the text of the Dharma-sutra, and our\nimperfect knowledge of the history of the Mahabharata, it would be hazardous\nto assert that the verse proves Baudhayana\'s acquaintance with Vyasa\'s great\nepic. It will be safer to wait for further proofs that it was known to the\nSutrakaras, before one bases far-going speculations on this hitherto solitary\nquotation.\n\nThe arguments which maybe brought forward to show that Baudhayana\'s home lay\nin Southern India are not as strong as those which permit us to determine the\nnative country of \xc3\x82pastamba. The portions of the Sutras, known to me, contain\nno direct mention of the south except in the de _s_ anir _n_ aya or\ndisquisition on the countries, Dharma-sutra I, 1, 2, where certain peculiar\ncustoms of the southern Brahmans are enumerated, and some districts of\nSouthern India, e _g_. Kali\xe1\xb9\x85ga, are referred to as barbarous countries which\nmust not be visited by \xc3\x82ryans. These utterances show an acquaintance with the\nsouth, but by no means prove that Baudhayana lived there. A more significant\nfact is that Baudhayana declares, I, 1, 2, 4, \'going to sea\' to be a custom\nprevailing among the northern Brahmans, and afterwards, II, I, 22, places that\nact at the head of the Pataniyas,\n\np. xlii\n\nthe more serious offences causing loss of caste. It is probable that by the\nlatter rule he wished to show his stand-point as a southerner. But the most\nconclusive argument in favour of the southern origin of the Baudhayaniyas is\nthat they, like the \xc3\x82pastambiyas and all other adherents of the Taittiriya\nschools, are entirely confined to the Dekhan, and are not found among the\nindigenous subdivisions of the Brahmans in Central and Northern India. This\nfact is, if not explicitly stated, at least implied by the passage of the\nMahar _n_ ava quoted in the Introduction to \xc3\x82pastamba 1. It is proved by the\npresent state of things, and by the evidence of the land grants of the\nsouthern dynasties, several of which have been made in favour of\nBaudhayaniyas. Thus we find a grant of Bukkaraya, the well-known ruler of Vi\n_g_ ayanagara 2, dated Sakasa _m_ vat 1276 or 1354-5 A _D_., in which a Brahma\n_n_ a, studying the Baudhayaniya-sutra, is mentioned as the donee of a village\nin Maisur. Again, in an inscription of Nandivarman Pallavamalla, which its\neditor, the Rev. Mr. Foulkes, places in the ninth century A D. 3, a\nconsiderable number of Brahma _n_ as of the Prava _k_ ana-sutra are named as\nrecipients of the royal bounty, together with some followers of the \xc3\x82pastambha\n4 school. As we have seen that Baudhayana is called in the G _ri_ hya-sutra\nthe Prava _k_ anakara, it is not doubtful that the Prava _k_ ana-sutra of this\ninscription is the Sutra of his school. The villages which the grantees\nreceived from Nandivarman were situated on the Palar river in the _K_ ittur\ndistricts of the Madras Presidency. Besides, the interesting tradition which\nasserts that Madhava-Saya _n_ a, the great commentator of the Vedas, was a\nBaudhayaniya 5 is another point which may be brought forward as evidence for\nthe location of the school in Southern India. Further,\n\np. xliii\n\nit must not be forgotten that most and the best MSS. of Baudhayana\'s Sutras\nare found in Southern India. There are also some faint indications that the\nAndhra country is the particular district to which Baudhayana belonged. For\nhis repeated references to voyages by sea and his rule regarding the duty\npayable on goods imported by sea show that he must have lived in a coast\ndistrict where sea-borne trade flourished, and the fact that he uses the\nAndhra recension of the Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka makes it probable that he was\nan inhabitant of the eastern coast.\n\nMy estimate of the distance between Baudhayana and \xc3\x82pastamba and of that\nbetween the latter and the historical period of India has been given in the\nIntroduction to \xc3\x82pastamba, pp. xxii and xliii, and I have nothing further to\nadd on that subject. The oldest witness for the existence of the _S_ rauta-\nsutra of Baudhayana is its commentator Bhavasvamin, whom Dr. Burnell places in\nthe eighth century A. D. The Dharma-sutra is first quoted by Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ane\n_s_ vara, circiter 1080-1100 A _D_. Several of the passages adduced by him\nare, however, not traceable in the MSS.\n\nAs regards the materials on which the translation is based, I had at my\ndisposal six MSS. of the text and two copies of Govindasvamin\'s commentary,\nthe Bodhayaniya-dharmavivara _n_ a 1, one of which (C. I.) gives the text\nalso. These MSS. belong to two chief groups, a northern and a southern one.\nThe northern group contains two subdivisions. The first comprises (1) D., a\nMS. bought by me for the Government of Bombay at Ahmadabad (no. 6 of the\nDekhan College collection of 1868-69), and about one hundred or one hundred\nand fifty years old; (2) P., an old MS. of my own collection, bought in 1865\nat Pu _n_ a; (3, 4) B. and Bh., two modern transcripts, made for me in Baroda\nand Bombay, Among these, D. alone is of real value, as P., B., and Bh.\nfaithfully reproduce all its clerical errors and add a good many new ones. The\nsecond subdivision of the northern group is represented by K., a modern\ntranscript, made for\n\np. xliv\n\nthe Government of Bombay at Kolhapur in the southern Mara _th_ a country\n(Elphinstone College collection of 1867-68, Class VI, no. 2). The MSS. of the\nnorthern group, which give the vulgata current since the times of Nilaka _n_\n_th_ a.(1650 A. D.) and Mitrami _s_ ra (circiter 2 700 A. D.) in Western and\nCentral India, can be easily recognised by the omission of the third Adhyaya\nof Pra _s_ na IV, and by their placing IV, 5, 1 b-25 after IV, 7, 7. One of\nthe chief differences between K. and the other MSS. of the northern group is\nthe omission of II, 5, 8, 4-II, 6, 11, 15 in the latter. The southern group of\nMSS. is formed by M., a slovenly Devanagari transcript of a Grantha MS., no.\n610/1929 of the Madras Government collection 1, and by the text of C. L, a\nDevanagari copy of the MS. of Govindasvamin\'s commentary, presented by Dr.\nBurnell to the India Office library 2, The second copy of the commentary, C.\nT., a Telugu paper MS. from Tanjore, I owe to the kindness of Dr. Burnell.\n\nAs might be expected, on account of the southern origin of the Baudhayaniya\nschool, M. gives on the whole the best form of the text. It also carefully\nmarks the Ka _n_ _d_ ikas 3 in the first two Pra _s_ nas, ignoring the\nAdhyayas altogether, and contains at the end of each Pra _s_ na the first\nwords of each Ka _n_ _d_ ika, beginning with the last and ending with the\nfirst, after the fashion which prevails in the MSS. of the Taittiriya Sa _m_\nhita, Brahma _n_ a, and \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. Very close to M. comes Govinda\'s copy,\nwhere, however, as in most northern MSS., the Adhyayas alone are marked. It\nis, however, perfectly certain that in some very difficult passages, which are\ndisfigured by ancient corruptions, he corrected the text conjecturally 4 In a\ncertain number of cases the northern MSS. present better and older readings\nthan M. and C. I. 5 Under these\n\np. xlv\n\ncircumstances it has not been possible to follow the commentary or M.\nthroughout. Though they had to be made the basis, they had in many passages to\nbe set aside in favour of readings of the northern group. In some cases I have\nalso been obliged to make conjectural emendations, which have all been\nmentioned in the notes. Three Sutras, I, 8, 16, 13-15, have been left\nuntranslated, because the MSS. offer no safe basis for a conjectural\nrestoration, and the commentary is defective.\n\nGovinda, who, as Dr. Burnell informs me, is said to be a modern writer, seems\nto have composed his vivara _n_ a without the aid of older v _ri_ ttis. Though\nhe apparently was well acquainted with the writings belonging to the\nTaittiriya-veda, with the ritual and with the common law-books, he has not\nsucceeded in explaining all the really difficult passages. Sometimes he is\nclearly mistaken, and frequently he passes by in silence words or whole\nSutras, the sense or the general bearing of which is by no means certain.\nThough it would be ungrateful on my part to underrate the importance of his\nwork for my translation, I cannot place him in the same rank with Haradatta,\nthe commentator of \xc3\x82pastamba and Gautama, and can only regret that no older\ncommentary based on the living tradition of the Baudhayaniyas has been\navailable. If such a work were found, better readings and better explanations\nof many difficult passages would probably come to light. With the materials at\nmy disposal the translation has been a work of some difficulty, and in trying\nto settle the text I have often experienced the feeling of insecurity which\ncomes over the decipherer of a difficult inscription when the facsimiles are\nbad. The short Adhyaya on adoption, given in the appendix to the Dharma-sutra,\nhas been taken from the Smarta or G _ri_ hya-sutra. It does not belong to\nBaudhayana, but is frequently quoted by the writers on civil law, who wrote in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries of our era.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxix:1](sbe1403.htm#fr_22) I must here state that during my residence in\nIndia I have never met with a follower of Baudhayana\'s school, and cannot\npersonally vouch for its existence.
