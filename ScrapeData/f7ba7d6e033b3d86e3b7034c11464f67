The sacrifice is a man; it is a man for the reason that a man\nspreads (prepares) it. In being spread it is made just as large 2 as a man:\nthis is why the sacrifice is a man.\n\n3:5:3:22\\. The Soma-cart (shed) is no other than his head, and has Vish _n_ u\nfor its deity 3. And because Soma is therein--Soma being havis (material for\noffering) for the gods--therefore it is called Havirdhana (receptacle of\nhavis).\n\n3:5:3:33\\. The \xc3\x82havaniya is no other than his mouth: hence, when he offers on\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya, it is as if he poured (food) into the mouth.\n\n3:5:3:44\\. The sacrificial stake is no other than his crest-lock; and the\n\xc3\x82gnidhriya and Mar _g_ aliya 4 are his arms.\n\np. 127\n\n3:5:3:55\\. The Sadas 1 (tent for the priests) is no other than his belly:\nwherefore they feed in the Sadas, for whatever food is eaten here on earth all\nthat settles down here in the belly. And because all the gods sat (sad) in it\ntherefore it is called Sadas: and so do these Brahmans of every family now sit\ntherein.\n\n3:5:3:66\\. And the two fires which are behind 2 it are his feet. In being\nspread it is made just as large as a man: this is why the sacrifice is a man.\n\n3:5:3:77\\. The cart-shed has doors on both sides; and so has the Sadas doors\non both sides: hence this man is perforated from one end to the other. He\nsteps to the Soma-carts when they have been -washed down.\n\n3:5:3:88\\. They turn them round, the southern one on the south side, and the\nnorthern one on the north side 3. The larger of the two should be the southern\n(or right) one 4.\n\n3:5:3:99\\. Over them, having been turned round (and placed on the altar), they\nput a mat of reed-grass; or, if he cannot procure a reed-mat, a frame of split\ncane\n\np. 128\n\nmade in like manner as a reed-mat. They fasten a front-band (to the posts of\nthe front door 1). They enclose (the carts) within two upright hurdles; and\nlay a (second) reed-mat, or a frame of split cane made in like manner as a\nreed-mat, behind (the first mat 2).\n\n3:5:3:1010\\. Now 3, having again entered (the hall), and\n\np. 129\n\ntaken ghee in four ladlings, he makes offering to Savit _ri_ for his\nimpulsion, for Savit _ri_ is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the gods: \'We\nwill perform the sacrifice, for one impelled by Savit _ri_ ,\' thus (the priest\nthinks and) therefore he makes offering to Savit _ri_.\n\n3:5:3:1111\\. He offers with the text (Va _g_. S. V, 14; Rig-veda V, 81, 1),\n\'They harness the mind and they harness the thoughts\'--with the mind and with\nspeech they truly perform the sacrifice. When he says, \'They harness the\nmind,\' he harnesses the mind; and when he says, \'and they harness the thoughts\n(dhi),\' he harnesses speech; for it is thereby 1 that people seek to make\ntheir living in accordance with their respective intelligence (dhi), either by\nreciting (the Veda), or by readiness of speech, or by songs,--with these two\nthus harnessed they perform the sacrifice.\n\n3:5:3:1212\\. \'The priests of the priest, of the great inspirer of devotion,\'--\nthe learned Brahmans versed in sacred writ, truly, are the priests: it is\nregarding them that he says this. And \'of the great inspirer of devotion 2,\'--\nthe great inspirer of devotion, truly, is the sacrifice: it is regarding the\nsacrifice that he says this. \'The knower of rites alone hath assigned the\npriestly offices,\' for, in performing\n\np. 130\n\nthe sacrifice, they indeed assign the priestly offices. \'Great is the praise\nof the divine Savit _ri_ ; Hail!\' Thus he offers to Savit _ri_ for his\nimpulsion.\n\n3:5:3:1313\\. Having then taken ghee a second time in four ladlings, he walks\nout (of the hall by the front door). The (sacrificer\'s) wife is led out by the\nsouth door. He then lays down a piece of gold in the right wheel-track of the\nsouthern Sonia-cart, and offers thereon, with (Va _g_. S. V, 15; Rig-veda I,\n22, 17), \'Vish _n_ u strode through this(universe),thrice he put down his\nfoot: it is enveloped in his dust; Hail!\' The residue (of ghee) he pours into\nthe wife\'s hand. She anoints the burning (part) of the axle 1 with (Va _g_. S.\nV, 17), \'Audible to the gods, announce ye unto the gods!\' He hands to his\nassistant both the offering-spoon and the melting-pot. They lead the wife\nround by the back of the two fires 2.\n\n3:5:3:1414\\. Having taken ghee in four ladlings, the assistant lays down a\npiece of gold in the right wheel-track of the northern Soma-cart, and offers\nthereon, with (Va _g_. S. V, 16; Rig-veda VII, 99, 3), \'Be ye too abundant in\nfood and milch kine and pastures, through benevolence to man! Thou proppedst\nasunder these two worlds, O Vish _n_ u; with beams of light didst thou hold\nfast 3 the earth on all sides; Hail!\' The residue (of ghee) he pours into the\nwife\'s hand. She anoints the burning (part) of the axle with,\n\np. 131\n\n[paragraph continues] \'Audible to the gods, announce ye unto the gods!\' Then\nas to why he thus offers.\n\n3:5:3:1515\\. Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were\nafraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas; and, the ghee being a\nthunderbolt, they kept off the evil spirits from the south by that\nthunderbolt, the ghee; and thus they came not after them on their way. And in\nlike manner does he now keep off the evil spirits from the south by that\nthunderbolt, the ghee; and thus they do not come after him on his way. And the\nreason why he offers with two verses relating to Vish _n_ u, is that the Soma-\ncart belongs to Vish _n_ u.\n\n3:5:3:1616\\. And in that the wife anoints the burning (part) of the axle,\nthereby a productive union is effected; for when woman and man become heated,\nthe seed flows, and thereupon birth takes place. She anoints in a direction\naway (from the cart), for away the seed is cast. He then says (to the Hot _ri_\n), \'Recite to the Soma-carts as they are wheeled forward 1!\'\n\n3:5:3:1717\\. He makes (the sacrificer) say, \'Go ye both forward, furthering\nthe cult!\' The cult, namely, is the sacrifice: \'go ye both forward, furthering\nthe sacrifice\' he thereby means to say. \'Convey ye the sacrifice upward; lead\nit not astray 2!\' whereby he means to say, \'convey this sacrifice upward to\nthe world of the gods;\' and by saying \'lead it not astray,\' he prays for this\n(sacrificer) that he may not\n\np. 132\n\nstumble. Let them wheel (the carts) forward, as it were lifting them, so that\nthey may not creak; for of the Asuras is that voice which is in the axle 1:\n\'Lest the Asuras\' voice should speak here!\' so he thinks. But if they should\ncreak,--\n\n3:5:3:1818\\. Let him make (the sacrificer) say this, \'Speak ye unto your own\ncow-pen, ye divine resorts; speak not my life away, speak not my offspring\naway!\' This, then, is the expiation thereof.\n\n3:5:3:1919\\. As to this they say, \'Let him stride three steps from the high\naltar westward and make the Soma-carts stop there: this is the measure for the\nSoma-carts.\' But there is no (fixed) measure in this; wherever he himself may\nthink fit in his mind, only not too near 2, nor too far (from the high altar),\nthere let him stop them.\n\n3:5:3:2020\\. He salutes them with, \'May ye rejoice here on the height of the\nearth!\' for this (altar) is verily the height 3 (top) of the earth, since his\noffering-fire is in the heaven. He makes them rest on their naves 4 for that\nis the appearance of repose.\n\np. 133\n\n3:5:3:2121\\. The Adhvaryu, having gone round along the north side (of the\ncarts), props the southern cart, with (Va _g_. S. V, 18; Rig-veda I, 154, 1),\n\'Now will I declare the heroic deeds of Vish _n_ u, who measured out the\nearthly regions; who propped the upper seat, striding thrice, the wide-\nstepping! For Vish _n_ u (I prop) thee!\' He fixes the prop in a different\nplace from where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice 1.\n\n3:5:3:2222\\. The assistant then props the northern cart, with (Va _g_. S. V,\n19), \'Either from the heaven, O Vish _n_ u, or from the earth, or from the\ngreat, wide airy region, O Vish _n_ u, fill both thine hands with wealth and\nbestow on us from the right and the left! For Vish _n_ u thee!\' He fixes the\nprop in a different place from where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice. The\nreason why he performs with prayers to Vish _n_ u is that the Soma-cart\nbelongs to Vish _n_ u.\n\n3:5:3:2323\\. He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching the middle\nreed-mat 2 (Va _g_. S. V, 20; Rig-veda I, 154, 2), \'Let Vish _n_ u then be\npraised for his power, terrible like a wild beast prowling about the\nmountains, on whose three wide strides all beings abide!\' Now that (mat-\ncovering) indeed is his (Vish _n_ u, the shed\'s) upper skull-bone 3\n\np. 134\n\nfor thereon, as it were, the other skull-bones rest: this is why he says \'they\nabide on.\'\n\n3:5:3:2424\\. Thereupon he makes him say, after touching the front-band (Va\n_g_. S. V, 2), \'Thou art Vish _n_ u\'s fillet;\' for it indeed is his fillet. He\nthen makes him say, after touching the two upright hurdles, \'Ye are the\ncorners of Vish _n_ u\'s mouth;\' for they indeed are the corners of his mouth.\nThen that mat which is behind there, that indeed is that skull-bone of his\nhere behind (viz. the occiput).\n\n3:5:3:2525\\. With \'Thou art Vish _n_ u\'s sewer 1,\' he sews (the hurdles to the\nfour door posts) with cord by means of a wooden pin. With, \'Thou art Vish _n_\nu\'s fixed (point) 2,\' he then makes a knot, \'lest it should fall asunder.\'\nThat same (knot) he undoes when the work is completed; and thus disease 3\nbefalls not either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer. The completed (cart-shed)\nhe touches with, \'Thou art Vish _n_ u\'s own,\' for the Soma-cart (and shed)\nbelongs to Vish _n_ u.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[126:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_341) Yavat-tavat would rather seem to mean here \'of\ncorresponding (or relatively the same) proportions\' as a man, viz. as the\nrespective sacrificer. \'Sa vai tayamano yavan eva purushas tavan vidhiyate,\npurushasyaiva vidham anu.\' Ka _n_ va rec.\n\n[126:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_342) Soma himself is Vish _n_ u.\n\n[126:4](sbe2621.htm#fr_343) See [III, 6, 1, 23](sbe2623.htm#3:6:1:23); [2,\n21](sbe2624.htm#3:6:2:21).\n\n[127:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_344) See [III, 6, 2, 21](sbe2624.htm#3:6:2:21).\n\n[127:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_345) That is, the (old) \xc3\x82havaniya and Garhapatya fires\nof the Pra _k_ ina-va _m_ _s_ a.\n\n[127:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_346) The southern (and larger) cart is under the charge\nof the Adhvaryu and the northern one under that of his assistant, the\nPratiprasthat _ri_. Each now drives his cart westward along the south and\nnorth sides respectively; and when they are opposite the hall ( _s_ ala), they\nmake the carts turn round from left to right; whereupon they drive back to the\naltar, and place them thereon with the shafts towards the east, near the anta\n_h_ pata (\'intermediate\' peg, see [III, 5, 1, 1](sbe2619.htm#3:5:1:1)), south\nand north of the \'spine\' (cf. [p. 112](sbe2619.htm#page_112), note\n[2](sbe2619.htm#fn_294)), each at the distance of one cubit from the latter.\n\n[127:4](sbe2621.htm#fr_347) In order to make the shed incline towards the\nnorth, cf. [III, 1, 1, 2](sbe2603.htm#3:1:1:2).\n\n[128:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_348) It is not clear to me whether the arrangements\nmentioned in this paragraph refer to the carts in the first place, and have\nthen to be repeated after the shed has been erected, or whether, as I think,\nsome of them refer to the shed only. Even at the time of the Katy. Sutras\nthere seems to have been some confusion in this respect, and the rules VIII,\n4, 7-12 (10-15, in edition) were entirely misunderstood by the commentator. It\nis, however, certain that the carts were covered with mats, previously to\nbeing shifted from the back to the front part of the altar. As regards the\nshed, it seems to have been constructed in the following way. In front of the\ncarts, as well as behind them, beams are driven into the ground, six on each\nside, according to Saya _n_ a on T. S. I, 2, 13; the two middle ones, one\ncubit north and south of the \'spine\' respectively, forming a gateway on each\nside (Katy. VIII, 4, 24 scholl.). On these two rows of beams other beams are\nlaid, running from south to north, and forming, as it were, the lintels of the\ngates; and thereon the tie-beams rest (west to east). This frame of timber is\nto form a square of nine (or ten) cubits. Over the tie-beams three mats of\nreed-grass( _k_ adis)--measuring nine (or ten) cubits by three (3\xc2\xbd)--are\nspread, from south to north; first the middle one and then the two others,\nbehind and in front of it. Upright hurdles (or reed-mats) are then stretched\nbetween the respective corner-posts, so as to form the south and north sides\nof the shed; and are \'sewn\' to the corner-posts. Between the tops of the two\nfront door-posts a band or garland of plaited reed-tufts (or, according to\nHaug, a bunch of Darbha grass, consisting of dry and green stalks) is hung up,\nto represent either a fillet or wreath worn on the forehead (?), or as a door-\ngarland.\n\n[128:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_349) This remark would seem to imply that there are\nonly two mats (cf. parags. [23](sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:23),\n[24](sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:24)), but perhaps it is merely intended to show that\ntwo mats are spread behind and in front of the first mat (i.e. from south to\nnorth, and not west to east); not that there are only two mats.\n\n[128:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_350) If the preceding paragraph refers (at least\npartly) to the shed, p. 129 then the atha here means \'Now, in the first\nplace,\' thereby introducing details preliminary to what has just been stated.\n\n[129:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_351) See [III, 2, 4, 16](sbe2610.htm#3:2:4:16). I now\nrefer \'etaya\' to \'va _k_ am,\' as does Saya _n_ a,--yada buddhir _g_ ayate tada\nkhalv etaya va _k_ a _g_ u _g_ yushanti. He explains \'prakamodya\' by \'mlai _k_\n_kh_ ika _m_ laukikam bhasha _n_ am,\' barbarous, worldly speech.\n\n[129:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_352) Vipa _s_ _k_ it, probably \'thinker of hymns.\' It\nremains doubtful what meaning our author assigned to the word. Mahidhara\nexplains it by sarva _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, \'all-knowing.\' Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. S. I, 2,\n13, refers \'viprasya b _ri_ hato vipa _s_ _k_ itah\' to the sacrificer.\n\n[130:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_353) That is, the iron pins driven into the axle, round\nwhich the naves of the wheels revolve. See also [p.\n121](sbe2620.htm#page_121), note [2](sbe2620.htm#fn_322).\n\n[130:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_354) They make her enter the hall by the south door and\nwalk round by the back of the (old) Garhapatya fire-place to the wheel-tracks\non the north side where the Pratiprasthat _ri_ is about to offer.\n\n[130:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_355) The rays of the sun are apparently likened to\nropes wherewith he keeps the earth straight and firm.\n\n[131:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_356) While reciting his hymn of eight verses (brought\nup, as usual, to twelve by repetitions of the first and last verses) the Hot\n_ri_ has to follow the carts so as to have the north wheel-track of the south\ncart between his feet. Cf. [p. 79](sbe2614.htm#page_79), note\n[1](sbe2614.htm#fn_208). For the verses recited by him, see Ait. Br. I, 29; \xc3\x82\n_s_ v. _S_ r. IV, 9.\n\n[131:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_357) Or, \'falter not!\'\n\n[132:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_358) The Taitt. S. VI, 2, 9 refers it to Varu _n_ a, on\naccount of the axle being bound firmly with strings (thongs), resembling Varu\n_n_ a\'s noose.\n\n[132:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_359) Rather, \'not so very near,\' \'nicht allzu nahe,\nnicht gar zu nahe.\'\n\n[132:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_360) Both here, and on Taitt. S. I, 2, 13, Saya _n_ a\ntakes \'varshman\' in the sense of body ( _s_ arira).\'\n\n[132:4](sbe2621.htm#fr_361) Or rather, \'nave-boards (nabhya).\' The cart wheels\nare described as consisting, after the fashion prevalent in Malaya (Katy.\nVIII, 4, 5 scholl.), of three parallel boards: the two outer ones form\nsegments, and the middle and largest one has the nave fixed to it, the axle-\npin running through its centre. It is on this middle board that he is to make\nthe carts stand. Perhaps \'kshema\' should be taken in the sense of \'security,\nfirm position,\' instead of repose, rest,\' in which case the upright position\nof the middle board would seem to be compared with a man in upright position;\n\'nabhi (nabhya)\' meaning both \'navel\' and \'nave.\'\n\n[133:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_362) Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. S. I, 2, 13, remarks:--\'The\nsouthern and northern parts of the yoke represent the ears of the cart.\nThrough a hole (is effected) the firm tying (of the yoke parts) to the shafts.\nAt the juncture (sandhi) at the (place of) fastening of the southern (part of\nthe yoke) the prop is fixed.\' In ordinary practice the prop is put up to\nsupport the extreme end of the shafts or pole.\n\n[133:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_363) See p. 128, note 1.\n\n[133:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_364) Apparently the parietal bone is meant; or perhaps\nthe frontal bone. The Ka _n_ va text reads: \'He then touches that reed-mat, or\np. 134 cane-frame, above, with "Let Vish _n_ u . . ." for that is for him\n(Vish _n_ u, the shed) what that skull-bone is up here. And when he says "they\nabide upon," it is because that rest on the other skull-bones [? adhi hy etad\nanyeshu kapaleshu kshiyanti!]. Then what two reed-mats there are on the two\ncarts, they indeed are for him what the two skull-bones are here on both\nsides. And that reed-mat, or cane-frame, which he puts on there behind (or\nbehind that one), that is for him what the skull-bone behind is.\'\n\n[134:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_365) Syu, explained by Saya _n_ a as \'thread, cord,\' by\nMahidhara as \'needle.\'\n\n[134:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_366) ? Dhruva _h_ , the \'firm one,\' (? \'pole-star.\')\nThe St. Petersburg Dictionary gives the tentative meaning \'knot.\' The Taitt.\nS. reads \'dhruvam.\'\n\n[134:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_367) Graha, lit. \'seizing.\' For Varu _n_ a, whose\nattribute the knot is, (I, 3, 1, 16), seizing upon men by means of disease;\nsee II, 5, 2, 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 5, 4.
