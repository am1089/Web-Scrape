Having sacrificed the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions, he should offer \xc3\x82 _g_ ya\noblations (to the following deities, viz.) Savitri, Brahman, Belief, Insight,\nWisdom, Memory, Sadasaspati, Anumati, the metres, and the _Ri_ shis.\n\n5\\. He then sacrifices grains with curds (with the following texts):\n\n6\\.

Sitting down to the west of the fire on Darbha grass, the tufts of\nwhich are directed towards the east, he should put Darbha blades into a water-\npot, and making a Brahma _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali (i.e. joining his hands as a sign of\nveneration for the Brahman), he should murmur (the following texts):\n\n12\\.

Perhaps the division of these Sutras\nshould be altered, so that _s_ rava _n_ asya would belong to Sutra 2. In this\ncase we should have to translate, '2. When the herbs appear, (on a day on\nwhich the moon stands in conjunction) with _S_ rava _n_ a. 3. Or on the fifth\n(Tithi) of the _S_ rava _n_ a month, under (the Nakshatra) Hasta.' Comp. _s_\nrava _n_ asya pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ amim, Par. II, 10, 2. If we count the month beginning\nwith the bright fortnight, and assume that the full moon day of _S_ rava _n_ a\nfalls, as the name of the month implies, on _S_ rava _n_ a, the fifth Tithi of\nthat month will fall indeed on Hasta.

On the grains with curds, comp. Sutra 5. The technical sense of the\n'cleaning' is explained in the _S_ rauta-sutra I, 8, 2; comp.
