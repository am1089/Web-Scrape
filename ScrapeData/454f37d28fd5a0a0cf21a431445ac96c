For this reason Badaraya _n_ a (opines that the released person is) of\nboth kinds; as in the case of the twelve days' sacrifice.\n\nThe teacher Badaraya _n_ a, again, thinks that for this reason, i.e. because\nscripture contains indications of both kinds, the proper conclusion is that\nthe released person exists in both\n\np. 413\n\nconditions. When he wishes to have a body, he appears with one; when he wishes\nto be disembodied, he is without one. For he has various wishes, and all his\nwishes are realised.--'As in the case of the twelve days' sacrifice.' As the\nsoma sacrifice extending over twelve days may be viewed either as a sattra or\nas an ahina sacrifice, because both alternatives are indicated by scriptural\npassages [1](sbe38331.htm#fn_234); so it is here also.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 13](sbe38329.htm)\n\n"
