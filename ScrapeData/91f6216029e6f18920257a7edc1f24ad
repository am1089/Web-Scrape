About us was the quiet of midnight.\nThe moon, so little waned, made the black sky seem blacker, and the bright\nstars brighter, and in the air was a touch of wintry cold. Now and then, as we\npressed onward to the temple, a couple of women, veiled and muffled, would\npass us hurriedly, their bare feet as they struck the earth making still less\nsound than our own. The path was narrow by which, at last, we must tread our\nway into the temple-precincts. The court formed a parallelogram, giving,\nthrough an arch at its further end, upon the street. To right and left its\nsides were formed of long rows of buildings. The entrance to the temple\nitself, the hall of worship, was at some distance in the wall upon our right.\nAnd here, at the approach, the near end was almost closed by a small circular\nbuilding, a sort of domed arcade, lifted high above the level of the ground\n\np. 65\n\nand surrounded by a procession path, with stairs to the right and left.\n\nThis was in fact the chapel of the exposition, standing open, silent, and\nempty, the year round. This morning, however, it was not empty: for on the\naltar beneath its dome stood the images, throned on flowers, of Radha and\nKrishna, brought there in procession from the sanctuary, some time after\nmidnight. And without, on the stairs and terrace of the ambulatory, a line of\nquiet women circulated, their bowed heads and wrapt faces, or the beads half-\nhidden beneath their veils, telling of the worship in which they were\nabsorbed. Even in the distance, outside the narrow precincts, the sight of\nthese women doing _pradakshina_ gave a feeling of unwonted stir. But nothing\ncould have prepared us for the sight that greeted us as we actually entered.\nThe whole court was ablaze with light. Inside square enclosures made of rope\ntwo separate choirs were seated on the ground, chanting the litanies to the\naccompaniment of stringed instruments. The walls right and left were lined\nwith scores of little booths, where small religious images, household\nutensils, and a great assortment of baskets, were being bought and sold. And\nbetween the two, between devotees and traffickers, were coming and going\nhundreds of women. Here and there, in some corner in the shadow, would be\nfound one seated alone and\n\np. 66\n\nlost in prayer; and high on the plinth, on a level with our heads, the quiet\nprocession of worshippers went on, ascending to join the line by one stair,\nand leaving it to mingle with the crowd by the other. But down here, on the\nfloor of the court, one met widows and family parties--mothers and their\ndaughters, girls and their companions, threading their way, their worship\ndone, from point to point; staying here and there to chat a moment with some\nfriend, or pausing at the stalls to chaffer over their wares, and perhaps to\nbuy a toy or a gift for someone at home. The crowd was constantly growing by\nthe addition of newcomers, and as constantly being depleted by the loss of\nthose who were drifting off for bathing to the Ganges side, or turning to go\nhome. Within half an hour of dawn the precincts would be deserted. By night\nthe images would be reinstalled amidst the shadows of their sanctuaries. For\nthe present, however, all was piety and gentle gaiety. Outside, the fading\nmoon smiled down upon the sleeping city. Nothing seemed to be moving beneath\nthe folds of darkness. Yet here, within the little space of brilliant\nlamplight, buzzed the crowd of graceful well-born women. Here was day before\ndaylight, in a world apart--a woman\'s world, whose very existence one sleeping\na stone\'s throw off might never have suspected.\n\nHow well has Hinduism understood how to\n\np. 67\n\nprovide opportunities, that each of her children, even her cloistered secluded\nwomanhood, may feast on the changing circling beauties of the year! In all the\nround of months, no other full moon is held so beautiful as this, the first of\nthe winter season. The rains are over; the festival of Durga, the Mother, is\npast; and now begins the out-of-doors life of forest and pasture. This was the\ntime at which the Lord Krishna--living among the cowherds on the bank of the\nJumna--went forth, with the herdsmen and herdswomen of Gokul, taking their\ncattle to the meadows of Brindaban. At this time of year began that wondrous\nlife--of play and conquest, of constant self-sacrifice and easy victory--that\nis, in fact, the idyll of the Indian peasant, the epos of the Indian Herakles.\nIn every woodland at this time of year may be heard, by the inner ear, the\nmusic of the Divine Flute-player. Out of any bush might peep the laughing face\nof the Holy Child, beneath its crown of peacocks\' feathers. Mothers and maids\nhave a reverence for all play: for He, the Lord, plays through these winter\nmonths in the forests round Gokul!\n\nThree evenings ago, when the moon was full, the images were carried from\ntemple to tabernacle at the hour of sunset with all the men of the village in\nprocession behind them. Thus was dramatised the idea of the cowherds going\nforth.\n\np. 68\n\n[paragraph continues] All night long the priests watched and served, and at\nmidnight began the women\'s worship. The Divine Cowherd was dwelling now in the\npasturelands, and they came, as it were, to visit and adore. The next night\nthe exposition began at two, and to-day it was opened at four. All these three\ndawns have been sacred to the women, and at eight o\'clock this morning the\nfestival will be over. But in rich mens\' gardens along the Ganges banks a\nspecial devotion may prolong it to a week, a fortnight, or a month. Each day,\nlong before sunrise, the images will be carried to their throne of flowers,\nand there, beneath the sky, their visitors will worship them and spend hours\nof prayer that is more like play with the Herdsmen of Souls, tending his cows\nas in the forest at Brindaban\n\nA little while and our feast will have vanished, for this year, into the past.\nBut in truth a note has been sounded for pious souls in whose key the winter\nwill be pitched. To mother and wife, will not the thought of any one of her\nbeloved be as a glimpse caught of the Divine Cowherd--now spouse of the soul,\nand again the laughing, playing human babe? Is there any impulse or memory of\nsweetness that is not like the sound of his flute, calling suddenly across the\nmeadows? Oh, when that note is heard, how eager should be the feet that haste\nto answer, along the forest paths in the secret places of the heart!\n\np. 69\n\n"When his flute calls," says a song of the people, "I must be ready! Early or\nlate, easy or hard, no matter, I must go; and go, let the way through the\nforest be thorny when it sounds. I spread thorns every day on the courtyard\nfloor, that on them I may learn to walk. And lest in the rains I should hear\nhis call, I throw water where I am to step. For when He calls me I must\nhasten, and on the way I must not slip."\n\nHow foolish are those who dream that _Ras Mela_ comes but once a year, and\nends! To the eyes of the wise man life itself is that forest on the banks of\nthe Jumna in which ever dwells the Lord, filling sweet days with mirthful\nlabour, and calling the soul from height to height of hidden joy.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Plague](seh15.htm)\n\n'
