And (there would follow from that doctrine) either finite duration or\nabsence of omniscience (on the Lord's part).\n\nThe hypothesis of the argumentative philosophers is invalid, for the following\nreason also.--They teach that the Lord is omniscient and of infinite duration,\nand likewise that the pradhana, as well as the individual souls, is of\ninfinite duration. Now, the omniscient Lord either defines the measure of the\npradhana, the souls, and himself, or does not define it. Both alternatives\nsubvert the doctrine under discussion. For, on the former alternative, the\npradhana, the souls, and the Lord, being all of them of definite measure, must\nnecessarily be of finite duration; since ordinary experience teaches that all\nthings of definite extent, such as jars and the like, at some time cease to\nexist. The numerical measure of pradhana, souls, and Lord is\n\np. 439\n\ndefined by their constituting a triad, and the individual measure of each of\nthem must likewise be considered as defined by the Lord (because he is\nomniscient). The number of the souls is a high one 1. From among this limited\nnumber of souls some obtain release from the sa _m_ sara, that means their sa\n_m_ sara comes to an end, and their subjection to the samsara comes to an end.\nGradually all souls obtain release, and so there will finally be an end of the\nentire sa _m_ sara and the sa _m_ sara state of all souls. But the pradhana\nwhich is ruled by the Lord and which modifies itself for the purposes of the\nsoul is what is meant by sa _m_ sara. Hence, when the latter no longer exists,\nnothing is left for the Lord to rule, and his omniscience and ruling power\nhave no longer any objects. But if the pradhana, the souls, and the Lord, all\nhave an end, it follows that they also have a beginning, and if they have a\nbeginning as well as an end, we are driven to the doctrine of a general void.\n--Let us then, in order to avoid these untoward conclusions, maintain the\nsecond alternative, i.e. that the measure of the Lord himself, the pradhana,\nand the souls, is not defined by the Lord.--But that also is impossible,\nbecause it would compel us to abandon a tenet granted at the outset, viz. that\nthe Lord is omniscient.\n\nFor all these reasons the doctrine of the argumentative philosophers,\naccording to which the Lord is the operative cause of the world, appears\nunacceptable.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[439:1](sbe34217.htm#fr_422) I.e. a high one, but not an indefinite one; since\nthe omniscient Lord knows its measure.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 42](sbe34218.htm)\n\n"
