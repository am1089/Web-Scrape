The eighth day of the dark fortnight that follows after the full moon of\nMagha, is called Ekasn _t_ aka.\n\n3\\. On the day before that Ash _t_ aka, under (the Nakshatra) Anuradhas, in\nthe afternoon he puts wood on the fire, strews southward-pointed and eastward-\npointed Darbha grass around it, and turns rice out of four shallow cups over\nwhich he has laid one purifier, with (the Mantra), 'I turn out, impelled by\nthe god Savit _ri_ , this cake prepared from four cups (of rice), which may\ndrive away all suffering from the Fathers in the other world. On the impulse\nof the god Savit _ri_ , with the arms of the two A _s_ vins, with Pushan's\nhands I turn thee out, agreeable to the fathers, the grandfathers, the great-\ngrandfathers.'\n\n4. 4 With the same purifier he silently strains the Proksha _n_ i water; he silently sprinkles (with that water the rice and the vessels), silently husks (the rice), silently bakes it in four dishes like a Puro _d_ a _s_ a, sprinkles (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on it, takes it from the fire, sprinkles (water) round (the fire) from right to left, and puts a piece of Udumbara wood on (the fire). With the (spoon called) Darvi which is made of Udumbara wood, he cuts off in one continual line which is directed towards south-east, (the Avadana portions)\n\np. 233\n\none after the other, spreading under and sprinkling over them (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya), and\nsacrifices them, one after the other, in one continual line which is directed\ntowards south-east, with (the Mantras), 'The mortars, the pressing-stones have\nmade their noise, preparing the annual offering. Ekash _t_ aka! May we be rich\nin offspring, in valiant sons, the lords of wealth. Svadha! Adoration!\n\n'God Agni! The cake which is prepared with ghee and accompanied by (the word)\nsvadha, that the Fathers may satiate themselves\xc2\x97(this our) offering carry\nduly, Agni. I, the son, sacrifice an oblation to my fathers. Svadha!\nAdoration!\n\n'Here is a cake, Agni, prepared from four cups (of rice), with ghee, rich in\nmilk, in wealth, in prosperity. May the Fathers gladly accept it all together;\nmay it be well sacrificed and well offered by me. Svadha! Adoration!'\n\n5\\. Then he makes oblations of (other) food with (the verses), 'The one who\nshone forth as the first,' 'The Ekash _t_ aka, devoting herself to\nausterities,' 'She who shone forth as the first' (Taitt. Sa _m_ hita IV, 3,\n11, I. 3. 5).\n\n6\\. Cutting off (the Avadanas destined for the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t oblation)\ntogether from the cake and from the (other) food and mixing them with\nclarified butter, he makes an oblation thereof with (the formula), 'To Agni\nKavyavahana Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t svadha! Adoration!'\n\n7. 7 That (cake) with ghee and honey and with the food (mentioned in Sutras 5. 6) he touches in the way prescribed for the _S_ raddha ceremony and puts\n\np. 234\n\ndown lumps (of it) according to the ritual of the Pi _n_ _d_ a offerings.\n\n8\\. (The remains of) that (cake, &c.) he serves to learned Brahma _n_ as.\n\n9\\. He gives them food and presents as at the _S_ raddha ceremony.\n\n10. 10 The known (rites) down to the pouring out of the handfuls of water (are performed here) as at the monthly ( _S_ raddha).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[232:1](sbe30086.htm#fr_685) 14, 1.
