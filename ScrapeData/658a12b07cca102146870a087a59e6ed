There 3 was formerly the proud Gargya Balaki 4, a man of great reading. He\nsaid to A _g_ ata _s_ atru of Ka _s_ i, 'Shall I tell you Brahman?' A _g_ ata\n_s_ atru said: 'We give a thousand (cows) for that speech (of yours), for\nverily all people run away, saying, _G_ anaka (the king of Mithila) is our\nfather (patron) 5.'\n\n2\\. Gargya said: 'The person that is in the sun 6, that I adore as Brahman.' A\n_g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him\n\np. 101\n\nverily as the supreme, the head of all beings, the king. Whoso adores him\nthus, becomes Supreme, the head of all beings, a king.'\n\n3\\. Gargya said: 'The person that is in the moon (and in the mind), that I\nadore as Brahman.' A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do not speak to me\non this. I adore him verily as the great, clad in white raiment, as Soma, the\nking.' Whoso adores him thus, Soma is poured out and poured forth for him day\nby day, and his food does not fail 1.\n\n4\\. Gargya said: 'The person that is in the lightning (and in the heart), that\nI adore as Brahman.' A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do not speak to\nme on this. I adore him verily as the luminous.' Whoso adores him thus,\nbecomes luminous, and his offspring becomes luminous.\n\n5\\. Gargya said: 'The person that is in the ether (and in the ether of the\nheart), that I adore as Brahman.' A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do\nnot speak to me on this. I adore him as what is full, and quiescent.' Whoso\nadores him thus, becomes filled with offspring and cattle, and his offspring\ndoes not cease from this world.\n\n6\\. Gargya said: 'The person that is in the wind (and in the breath), that I\nadore as Brahman.' A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do not speak to me\non this. I adore him as Indra Vaiku _n_ _th_ a, as the unconquerable army (of\nthe Maruts).' Whoso adores him thus, becomes victorious, unconquerable,\nconquering his enemies.\n\np. 102\n\n7\\. Gargya said: 'The person that is in the fire (and in the heart), that I\nadore as Brahman.' A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do not speak to me\non this. I adore him as powerful.' Whoso adores him thus, becomes powerful,\nand his offspring becomes powerful.\n\n8\\. Gargya said: 'The person that is in the water (in seed, and in the heart),\nthat I adore as Brahman.' A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do not\nspeak to me on this. I adore him as likeness.' Whoso adores him thus, to him\ncomes what is likely (or proper), not what is improper; what is born from him,\nis like unto him 1.\n\n9\\. Gargya said: 'The person that is in the mirror, that I adore as Brahman.'\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore\nhim verily as the brilliant.' Whoso adores him thus, he becomes brilliant, his\noffspring becomes brilliant, and with whomsoever he comes together, he\noutshines them.\n\n10\\. Gargya said: 'The sound that follows a man while he moves, that I adore\nas Brahman.' A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do not speak to me on\nthis. I adore him verily as life.' Whoso adores him thus, he reaches his full\nage in this world, breath does not leave him before the time.\n\n11\\. Gargya said: 'The person that is in space, that I adore as Brahman.' A\n_g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him\nverily as the second who never leaves us.'\n\np. 103\n\nWhoso adores him thus, becomes possessed of a second, his party is not cut off\nfrom him,\n\n12\\. Gargya said: 'The person that consists of the shadow, that I adore as\nBrahman.' A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do not speak to me on this.\nI adore him verily as death.' Whoso adores him thus, he reaches his whole age\nin this world, death does not approach him before the time.\n\n13\\. Gargya said: 'The person that is in the body 1, that I adore as Brahman.'\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: 'No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore\nhim verily as embodied.' Whoso adores him thus, becomes embodied, and his\noffspring becomes embodied 2.\n\nThen Gargya became silent.\n\n14\\. A _g_ ata _s_ atru said: 'Thus far only?' 'Thus far only,' he replied. A\n_g_ ata _s_ atru said: 'This does not suffice to know it (the true Brahman).'\nGargya replied: 'Then let me come to you, as a pupil.'\n\n15\\. A _g_ ata _s_ atru said: 'Verily, it is unnatural that a Brahma _n_ a\nshould come to a Kshatriya, hoping that he should tell him the Brahman.\nHowever, I shall make you know him clearly,' thus saying he took him by the\nhand and rose.\n\nAnd the two together came to a person who was asleep. He called him by these\nnames, 'Thou, great one, clad in white raiment, Soma, King 3.' He\n\np. 104\n\ndid not rise. Then rubbing him with his hand, he woke him, and he arose.\n\n16\\. A _g_ ata _s_ atru said: 'When this man was thus asleep, where was then\nthe person (purusha), the intelligent? and from whence did he thus come back?'\nGargya did not know this?\n\n17\\. A _g_ ata _s_ atru said: 'When this man was thus asleep, then the\nintelligent person (purusha), having through the intelligence of the senses\n(pra _n_ as) absorbed within himself all intelligence, lies in the ether,\nwhich is in the heart 1. When he takes in these different kinds of\nintelligence, then it is said that the man sleeps (svapiti) 2. Then the breath\nis kept in, speech is kept in, the ear is kept in, the eye is kept in, the\nmind is kept in.\n\n18\\. But when he moves about in sleep (and dream), then these are his worlds.\nHe is, as it were, a great king; he is, as it were, a great Brahma _n_ a; he\nrises, as it were, and he falls. And as a great king might keep in his own\nsubjects, and move about, according to his pleasure, within his own domain,\nthus does that person (who is endowed with intelligence) keep in the various\nsenses (pra _n_ as) and move about, according to his pleasure, within his own\nbody (while dreaming).\n\n19\\. Next, when he is in profound sleep, and knows\n\np. 105\n\nnothing, there are the seventy-two thousand arteries called Hita, which from\nthe heart spread through the body 1. Through them he moves forth and rests in\nthe surrounding body. And as a young man, or a great king, or a great Brahma\n_n_ a, having reached the summit of happiness, might rest, so does he then\nrest.\n\n20\\. As the spider comes out with its thread, or as small sparks come forth\nfrom fire, thus do all senses, all worlds, all Devas, all beings come forth\nfrom that Self The Upanishad (the true name and doctrine) of that Self is 'the\nTrue of the True.' Verily the senses are the true, and he is the true of the\ntrue.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[100:1](sbe15058.htm#fr_313) Madhyandina text, p. 1058.\n\n[100:2](sbe15058.htm#fr_314) Whatever has been taught to the end of the third\n(according to the counting of the Upanishad, the first) Adhyaya, refers to\navidya, ignorance. Now, however, vidya, the highest knowledge, is to be\ntaught, and this is done, first of all, by a dialogue between Gargya D _ri_\nptabalaki and king A _g_ ata _s_ atru, the former, though a Brahma _n_ a,\nrepresenting the imperfect, the latter, though a Kshatriya, the perfect\nknowledge of Brahman. While Gargya worships the Brahman as the sun, the moon,\n&c., as limited, as active and passive, A _g_ ata _s_ atru knows the Brahman\nas the Self.\n\n[100:3](sbe15058.htm#fr_315) Compare with this the fourth Adhyaya of the\nKaushitaki-upanishad, Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 300; Gough,\nPhilosophy of the Upanishads, p. 144.\n\n[100:4](sbe15058.htm#fr_316) Son of Balaka, of the race of the Gargyas.\n\n[100:5](sbe15058.htm#fr_317) _G_ anaka, known as a wise and liberal king.\nThere is a play on his name, which means father, and is understood in the\nsense of patron, or of teacher of wisdom. The meaning is obscure; and in the\nKaush. Up. IV. i, the construction is still more difficult. What is intended\nseems to be that A _g_ ata _s_ atru is willing to offer any reward to a really\nwise man, because all the wise men are running after _G_ anaka and settling at\nhis court.\n\n[100:6](sbe15058.htm#fr_318) The commentator expatiates on all these answers\nand brings them more into harmony with Vedanta doctrines. Thus he adds that\nthe person in the sun is at the same time the person in the eye, who is both\nactive and passive in the heart, &c.\n\n[101:1](sbe15058.htm#fr_319) We miss the annasyatma, the Self of food,\nmentioned in the Kaush. Up., and evidently referred to in the last sentence of\nour paragraph. Suta and prasuta, poured out and poured forth, are explained as\nreferring to the principal and the secondary sacrifices.\n\n[102:1](sbe15058.htm#fr_320) Here the Kaush. Up. has the Self of the name,\ninstead of pratirupa, likeness. The commentator thinks that they both mean the\nsame thing, because a name is the likeness of a thing. Another text of the\nKaush. Up. gives here the Self of light. Pratirupa in the sense of likeness\ncomes in later in the Kaush. Up., \xc2\xa7 11.\n\n[103:1](sbe15058.htm#fr_321) 'In the \xc3\x82tman, in Pra _g_ apati, in the Buddhi,\nand in the heart.' Comm.\n\n[103:2](sbe15058.htm#fr_322) It is difficult to know what is meant here by\natman and atmanvin. In the Kaush. Up. A _g_ ata _s_ atru refers to Pra _g_\napati, and the commentator here does the same, adding, however, buddhi and h\n_ri_ d. Gough translates atmanvin by 'having peace of mind.' Deussen, p. 195,\npasses it over.\n\n[103:3](sbe15058.htm#fr_323) These names are given here as they occur in the\nKaushitaki-upanishad, not as in the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka-upanishad, where\nthe p. 104 first name was atish _th_ a _h_ sarvesham bhutanam murdha ra _g_ a.\nThis throws an important light on the composition of the Upanishads.\n\n[104:1](sbe15058.htm#fr_324) The ether in the heart is meant for the real\nSelf. He has come to himself, to his Self, i.e. to the true Brahman.\n\n[104:2](sbe15058.htm#fr_325) Svapiti, he sleeps, is explained as sva, his own\nSelf, and apiti for apyeti, he goes towards, so that 'he sleeps' must be\ninterpreted as meaning 'he comes to his Self.' In another passage it is\nexplained by svam apito bhavati. See _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's Commentary on the B _ri_ h.\n\xc3\x82r. Up. vol. i, p. 372.\n\n[105:1](sbe15058.htm#fr_326) 'Not the pericardium only, but the whole body.'\nComm.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2](sbe15059.htm)\n\n"
