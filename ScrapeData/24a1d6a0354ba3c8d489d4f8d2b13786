He took it down without being\nfrightened by all its twistings and writhings, and quickly set out again. And\nas he walked along in silence as before, the goblin said: "O King, you are\nobstinate, and you are pleasing to look at. So to amuse you, I will tell\nanother story. Listen."\n\n\n\nThere is a city called Ujjain, famous throughout the world. There lived a king\nnamed Merit, who had as counsellor a Brahman named Hariswami, adorned with all\nnoble virtues. The counsellor had a worthy wife, and a son named Devaswami was\nborn to her, and was as good as she. And they had one daughter named\nMoonlight, who was worthy of her name, for she was famous for her matchless\nbeauty and charm.\n\nWhen the girl had grown out of childhood, she was proud of her wonderful\nbeauty, and she told her mother, her father, and her brother: "I will marry a\nbrave man or a wise man or a clever man. I should die if I were married to\nanyone else."\n\nNow while her father was busy looking for such a husband for her, he was sent\nby King Merit to another king in the southern country to make a treaty for war\nand peace. When he had finished his business, a Brahman youth, who had heard\nof his daughter\'s beauty, came and asked him for her.\n\nAnd he said: "My daughter will not marry anyone unless he is a clever man or a\nwise man or a brave man. Which of these are you? Tell me." And the Brahman\nsaid: "I am a clever man." "Show me," said the father, and the clever man made\na flying chariot by his skill. Then he took Hariswami in this magic chariot,\nand carried him to the sky. And he took the delighted father to the camp of\nthe king of the southern country where he had been on business. Then Hariswami\nappointed the marriage for the seventh day.\n\nAt this time another Brahman youth in Ujjain came to the girl\'s brother and\nasked him for her. And when he was told that she would marry only a wise man\nor a clever man or a brave man, he said he was a brave man. Then when he had\nshown his skill with weapons, the brother promised his sister to the brave\nman. And without telling his mother, he consulted the star-gazers and\nappointed the marriage for the seventh day.\n\nAt the same time a third Brahman youth came to the girl\'s mother and asked for\nthe girl. And the mother said: "My son, a wise man or a clever man or a brave\nman shall marry my daughter but no one else. Which of these are you? Tell me."\nAnd he said: "I am a wise man." So she asked him about the past and the\nfuture, and found that he was a wise man. Then she promised to give him her\ndaughter on the seventh day.\n\nThe next day Hariswami came home and told his wife and his son all that he had\ndone. And she and he each told him all that she or he had done. So Hariswami\nwas greatly perplexed, because three bridegrooms had been invited. Then the\nseventh day came and the three bridegrooms came to Hariswami\'s house.\n\nStrange to say, at that moment Moonlight disappeared. Then the wise man said:\n"A giant named Smoke-tail has carried her to his den in the Vindhya forest."\n\nWhen Hariswami heard this from the wise man, he was frightened and asked the\nclever man to find a remedy for the trouble. And the clever man made a chariot\nas before, full of all kinds of weapons, and brought Hariswami with the wise\nman and the brave man in a moment to the Vindhya forest. And the wise man\nshowed them the giant\'s den.\n\nWhen the giant saw what had happened, he came out in anger, and the brave man\nfought with him. Then came a famous duel with strange weapons between a man\nand a giant for the sake of a woman, like the ancient fight between Rama and\nRavana. Though the giant was a terrible fighter, the brave man presently cut\noff his head with an arrow shaped like a half-moon. When the giant was killed,\nthey found Moonlight in the den and all went back to Ujjain in the clever\nman\'s chariot.\n\nThen when the proper time for wedding came, there arose a great dispute among\nthe three in Hariswami\'s house.\n\nThe wise man said: "If I had not discovered her by my wisdom, how could you\nhave found her hiding-place? She should be given to me."\n\nThe clever man said: "If I had not made a flying chariot, how could you have\ngone there in a moment and come back like the gods, or how could you have had\na chariot-fight with him? She should be given to me."\n\nThe brave man said: "If I had not killed the giant in the fight, who would\nhave saved her in spite of all your pains? The girl should be given to me."\n\nAnd as they quarrelled, Hariswami stood silent, confused, and perplexed.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story, he said to the king: "O King, do you say\nto which of them she should be given. If you know and will not tell, then your\nhead will split into a hundred pieces."\n\nThen the king broke silence and said: "She should be given to the brave man,\nwho risked his life and killed the giant and saved the girl. The wise man and\nthe clever man were only helpers whom Fate gave him. A star-gazer and a\nchariot-maker work for other people, do they not?"\n\nWhen the goblin heard this answer, he suddenly escaped from the king\'s\nshoulder and went back. And the king determined to get him, and went again to\nthe sissoo tree.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sixth Goblin: The Girl who transposed the Heads of her Husband and\nBrother.
