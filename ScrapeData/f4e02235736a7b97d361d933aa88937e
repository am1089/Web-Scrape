There is a dispute regarding five (practices) both in the south and in the\nnorth. 1\n\n2\\. We will explain those (peculiar) to the south.\n\n3\\. They are, to eat in the company of an uninitiated person, to eat in the\ncompany of one's wife, to eat stale food, to marry the daughter of a maternal\nuncle or of a paternal aunt. 3\n\n4\\. Now (the customs peculiar) to the north are, to deal in wool, to drink\nrum, to sell animals that have teeth in the upper and in the lower jaws, to\nfollow the trade of arms, to go to sea. 4\n\np. 147\n\n5\\. He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they\nprevail, commits sin. 5\n\n6\\. For each (of these customs) the (rule of the) country should be\n(considered) the authority.\n\n7\\. Gautama declares that that is false. 7\n\n8\\. And one should not take heed of either (set of practices) because they are\nopposed to the tradition of the _S_ ish _t_ as.\n\n9\\. The country of the \xc3\x82ryas (\xc3\x82ryavarta) lies to the east of the region where\n(the river Sarasvati) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest\n(Kalakavana), to the north of the Paripatra (mountains), to the south of the\nHimalaya. The rule of conduct which (prevails) there, is authoritative. 9\n\n10\\. Some (declare) the country between the (rivers) Yamuna and Ganges (to be\nthe \xc3\x82ryavarta). 10\n\n11\\. Now the Bhallavins quote also the (following) verse: 11\n\n12\\. 'In the west the boundary-river, in the east the region where the sun\nrises,--as far as the black antelopes wander (between these two limits), so\nfar spiritual pre-eminence (is found).' 12\n\np. 148\n\n13\\. The inhabitants of Avanti, of A\xe1\xb9\x85ga, of Magadha, of Surash _t_ ra, of the\nDekhan, of Upav _ri_ t, of Sindh, and the Sauviras are of mixed origin. 13\n\n14\\. He who has visited the (countries of the) \xc3\x82ra _t_ _t_ as, Karaskaras, Pu\n_n_ _d_ ras, Sauviras, Va\xe1\xb9\x85gas, Kali\xe1\xb9\x85gas, (or) Pranunas shall offer a Punastoma\nor a Sarvap _ri_ sh _th_ a (ish _t_ i). 14\n\n15\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He commits sin through his\nfeet, who travels to the (country of the) Kali\xe1\xb9\x85gas. The sages declare the Vai\n_s_ vanari ish _t_ i to be a purification for him.' 15\n\np. 149\n\n16\\. 'Even if many offences have been committed, they recommend for the\nremoval of the sin the Pavitresh _t_ i. For that (sacrifice) is a most\nexcellent means of purification.'\n\n17\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who performs (by turns) in\neach season the Vai _s_ vanari (ish _t_ i), the Vratapati (ish _t_ i), and the\nPavitresh _t_ i is freed from (all) sins.' 17\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[146:1](sbe1435.htm#fr_742) **2**. The boundary between the north and south of\nIndia is, as Govinda also points out, the river Narmada.\n\n[146:3](sbe1435.htm#fr_743) Some of the customs mentioned here still prevail\nin parts of southern India. Thus the marriages between cousins occur among the\nDe _s_ astha and Karha _d_ a Brahma _n_ as of the Dekhan.\n\n[146:4](sbe1435.htm#fr_744) The first two customs mentioned still prevail in\nthe north, especially in Ka _s_ mir, where Brahma _n_ as commonly deal in wool\nand woollen cloth. Spirituous liquor is not now drunk openly, but its use is\nsanctioned in the Ka _s_ mirian Nilamata-pura _n_ a. Many Brahmanical families\nin the north, especially in the North-western Provinces, subsist by enlisting\nas soldiers in the British and native armies.\n\n[147:5](sbe1435.htm#fr_745)-6. A similar argument is given by the Ka _s_\nmirians for the lawfulness of the consumption of meat, which they justify by a\nde _s_ agu _n_ a or 'virtue of their country.'\n\n[147:7](sbe1435.htm#fr_746) Gautama XI, 20.\n\n[147:9](sbe1435.htm#fr_747) Vasish _th_ a I, 8, 10. Many MSS., and among them\nthe Telugu copy of the commentary, read Pariyatra instead of Paripatra, which\nlatter I consider to be the correct form of the word.\n\n[147:10](sbe1435.htm#fr_748) Vasish _th_ a I, 12.\n\n[147:11](sbe1435.htm#fr_749) Vasish _th_ a I, 14. Govinda remarks that the\nBhallavins are a school studying the Sama-veda. See also Max Muller, Hist.\nAnc. Sansk. Lit., pp. 193, 364.\n\n[147:12](sbe1435.htm#fr_750) Vasish _th_ a I, 15. There is a great uncertainty\nin the MSS. about the word following sindhu _h_. I have adopted the reading of\np. 148 M., sindhur vidhara _n_ i, 'the boundary-river,' which occurs also in\nthe parallel passage of Vasish _th_ a. The Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS. read vi\n_k_ ara _n_ i or vi _k_ ara _n_ a, and the two copies of the commentary visara\n_n_ i. The sense of these various readings appears to be 'the river that\nvanishes or looses itself,' i.e. the Sarasvati.\n\n[148:13](sbe1435.htm#fr_751) This and the following two Sutras are intended to\nshow that the customs prevailing in the countries named have no authority and\nmust not be followed. Avanti corresponds to western Malva, A\xe1\xb9\x85ga to western\nBengal, Magadha to Bihar, and Surash _t_ ra to southern Ka _th_ iava _d_. The\nSauviras, who are always associated with the Sindhians, probably dwelt in the\nsouth-west of the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ab, near Multan. The Upav _ri_ ts probably are\nthe same as the Upav _ri_ ttas mentioned Mahabharata VI, 49. But I am unable\nto deter-mine their seats.\n\n[148:14](sbe1435.htm#fr_752) The \xc3\x82ra _t_ _t_ as dwelt in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ab\n(Lassen, Ind. Alth. I, p. 973, sec. ed.), and are greatly blamed, Mahabharata\nVIII, 44, 36 seq. The Karaskaras are named in the same chapter of the\nMahabharata as a degraded tribe, but seem to belong to the south of India. The\nKali\xe1\xb9\x85gas are the inhabitants of the eastern coast of India, between Orissa and\nthe mouth of the K _ri_ sh _n_ a river. The Pu _n_ _d_ ras, who are mentioned\nas a degraded tribe in the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a VII, 18, and occur frequently\nin the Mahabharata, and the Va\xe1\xb9\x85gas belong to Bengal (see Lassen, Ind. Alth. I,\n669, sec. ed.; Cunningham, Anc. Geog. p. 480). Regarding the Pu _n_ a-stoma,\nsee Gautama XIX, 7 note; and regarding the Sarvap _ri_ sh _th_ a ish _t_ i,\nTaittiriya-sa _m_ hita II, 3, 7, 1-2.\n\n[148:15](sbe1435.htm#fr_753) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 32, 18.\n\n[149:17](sbe1435.htm#fr_754) Vasish _th_ a XXII, 10. The meaning is that in\neach of the three seasons of the year, Grishma, Varsha, Hemanta, one of the\nthree sacrifices is to be offered.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 2, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 3](sbe1436.htm)\n\n"
