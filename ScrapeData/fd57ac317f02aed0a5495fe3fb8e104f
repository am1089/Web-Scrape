When and where\nthe play was first produced we do not know, for the prologue is silent as to\nthese matters. It has been thought that it was the last work of Kalidasa, even\nthat it was never produced in his lifetime. Some support is lent to this\ntheory by the fact that the play is filled with reminiscences of Shakuntala,\nin small matters as well as in great; as if the poet\'s imagination had grown\nweary, and he were willing to repeat himself. Yet _Urvashi_ is a much more\nambitious effort than _Malavika_ , and invites a fuller criticism, after an\noutline of the plot has been given.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the stage-director and his assistant, who appear in the\nprologue, the characters of the play are these:\n\nPURURAVAS, _king in Pratishthana on the Ganges_ ,  \nAYUS, _his son_.  \nMANAVAKA, _a clown, his friend_.  \nURVASHI, _a heavenly nymph_.  \nCRITRALEKHA, _another nymph, her friend_.  \nAUSHINARI, _queen of Pururava_ s.  \nNIPUNIKA, _her maid_.\n\n_A charioteer, a chamberlain, a hermit-woman, various nymphs and other divine\nbeings, and attendants_.\n\n\n\nThe scene shifts as indicated in the following analysis. The time of the first\nfour acts is a few days. Between acts four and five several years elapse.\n\n\n\nACT I.--The prologue only tells us that we may expect a new play of Kalidasa.\nA company of heavenly nymphs then appear upon Mount Gold-peak wailing and\ncalling for help. Their cries are answered by King Pururavas, who rides in a\nchariot that flies through the air. In response to his inquiries, the nymphs\ninform him that two of their number, Urvashi and Chitralekha, have been\ncarried into captivity by a\n\np. 116\n\ndemon. The king darts in pursuit, and presently returns, victorious, with the\ntwo nymphs. As soon as Urvashi recovers consciousness, and has rejoined her\njoyful friends, it is made plain that she and the king have been deeply\nimpressed with each other\'s attractions. The king is compelled to decline an\ninvitation to visit Paradise, but he and Urvashi exchange loving glances\nbefore they part.\n\nACT II.--The act opens with a comic scene in the king\'s palace. The clown\nappears, bursting with the secret of the king\'s love for Urvashi, which has\nbeen confided to him. He is joined by the maid Nipunika, commissioned by the\nqueen to discover what it is that occupies the king\'s mind. She discovers the\nsecret ingeniously, but without much difficulty, and gleefully departs.\n\nThe king and the clown then appear in the garden, and the king expresses at\nsome length the depth and seeming hopelessness of his passion. The latter part\nof his lament is overheard by Urvashi herself, who, impelled by love for the\nking, has come down to earth with her friend Chitralekha, and now stands near,\nlistening but invisible. When she has heard enough to satisfy her of the\nking\'s passion, she writes a love-stanza on a birch-leaf, and lets it fall\nbefore him. His reception of this token is such that Urvashi throws aside the\nmagic veil that renders her invisible, but as soon as she has greeted the\nking, she and her friend are called away to take their parts in a play that is\nbeing presented in Paradise.\n\nThe king and the clown hunt for Urvashi\'s love-letter, which has been\nneglected during the past few minutes. But the leaf has blown away, only to be\npicked up and read by Nipunika, who at that moment enters with the queen. The\nqueen can hardly be deceived by the lame excuses which the king makes, and\nafter offering her ironical congratulations, jealously leaves him.\n\n\n\nACT III.--The act opens with a conversation between two minor personages in\nParadise. It appears that Urvashi had taken the heroine\'s part in the drama\njust presented there, and when asked, "On whom is your heart set?" had absent-\nmindedly replied, "On Pururavas." Heaven\'s stage-director\n\np. 117\n\nhad thereupon cursed her to fall from Paradise, but this curse had been thus\nmodified: that she was to live on earth with Pururavas until he should see a\nchild born of her, and was then to return.\n\nThe scene shifts to Pururavas\' palace. In the early evening, the chamberlain\nbrings the king a message, inviting him to meet the queen on a balcony bathed\nin the light of the rising moon. The king betakes himself thither with his\nfriend, the clown. In the midst of a dialogue concerning moonlight and love,\nUrvashi and Chitralekha enter from Paradise, wearing as before veils of\ninvisibility. Presently the queen appears and with humble dignity asks pardon\nof the king for her rudeness, adding that she will welcome any new queen whom\nhe genuinely loves and who genuinely returns his love. When the queen departs,\nUrvashi creeps up behind the king and puts her hands over his eyes.\nChitralekha departs after begging the king to make her friend forget Paradise.\n\n\n\nACT IV.--From a short dialogue in Paradise between Chitralekha and another\nnymph, we learn that a misfortune has befallen Pururavas and Urvashi. During\ntheir honey-moon in a delightful Himalayan forest, Urvashi, in a fit of\njealousy, had left her husband, and had inadvertently entered a grove\nforbidden by an austere god to women. She was straightway transformed into a\nvine, while Pururavas is wandering through the forest in desolate anguish.\n\nThe scene of what follows is laid in the Himalayan forest. Pururavas enters,\nand in a long poetical soliloquy bewails his loss and seeks for traces of\nUrvashi. He vainly asks help of the creatures whom he meets: a peacock, a\ncuckoo, a swan, a ruddy goose, a bee, an elephant, a mountain-echo, a river,\nand an antelope. At last he finds a brilliant ruby in a cleft of the rocks,\nand when about to throw it away, is told by a hermit to preserve it: for this\nis the gem of reunion, and one who possesses it will soon be reunited with his\nlove. With the gem in his hand, Pururavas comes to a vine which mysteriously\nreminds him of Urvashi, and when he embraces it, he finds his beloved in his\narms. After she has explained to him the reason of her transformation, they\ndetermine to return to the king\'s capital.\n\np. 118\n\nACT V.--The scene of the concluding act is the king\'s palace. Several years\nhave passed in happy love, and Pururavas has only one sorrow--that he is\nchildless.\n\nOne day a vulture snatches from a maid\'s hand the treasured gem of reunion,\nwhich he takes to be a bit of bloody meat, and flies off with it, escaping\nbefore he can be killed. While the king and his companions lament the gem\'s\nloss, the chamberlain enters, bringing the gem and an arrow with which the\nbird had been shot. On the arrow is written a verse declaring it to be the\nproperty of Ayus, son of Pururavas and Urvashi. A hermit-woman is then ushered\nin, who brings a lad with her. She explains that the lad had been entrusted to\nher as soon as born by Urvashi, and that it was he who had just shot the bird\nand recovered the gem. When Urvashi is summoned to explain why she had\nconcealed her child, she reminds the king of heaven\'s decree that she should\nreturn as soon as Pururavas should see the child to be born to them. She had\ntherefore sacrificed maternal love to conjugal affection. Upon this, the\nking\'s new-found joy gives way to gloom. He determines to give up his kingdom\nand spend the remainder of his life as a hermit in the forest. But the\nsituation is saved by a messenger from Paradise, bearing heaven\'s decree that\nUrvashi shall live with the king until his death. A troop of nymphs then enter\nand assist in the solemn consecration of Ayus as crown prince.\n\nThe tale of Pururavas and Urvashi, which Kalidasa has treated dramatically, is\nfirst made known to us in the Rigveda. It is thus one of the few tales that so\ncaught the Hindu imagination as to survive the profound change which came over\nIndian thinking in the passage from Vedic to classical times. As might be\nexpected from its history, it is told in many widely differing forms, of which\nthe oldest and best may be summarised thus.\n\nPururavas, a mortal, sees and loves the nymph Urvashi. She consents to live\nwith him on earth so long as he shall not break certain trivial conditions.\nSome time after the birth of a son, these conditions are broken, through no\nfault of the man, and she leaves him. He wanders disconsolate, finds her, and\npleads with her, by her duty as a wife, by her love for her child, even by a\nthreat of suicide. She rejects his\n\np. 119\n\nentreaties, declaring that there can be no lasting love between mortal and\nimmortal, even adding: "There are no friendships with women. Their hearts are\nthe hearts of hyenas." Though at last she comforts him with vague hopes of a\nfuture happiness, the story remains, as indeed it must remain, a tragedy--the\ntragedy of love between human and divine.\n\nThis splendid tragic story Kalidasa has ruined. He has made of it an ordinary\ntale of domestic intrigue, has changed the nymph of heaven into a member of an\nearthly harem. The more important changes made by Kalidasa in the traditional\nstory, all have the tendency to remove the massive, godlike, austere features\nof the tale, and to substitute something graceful or even pretty. These\nprincipal changes are: the introduction of the queen, the clown, and the whole\nhuman paraphernalia of a court; the curse pronounced on Urvashi for her\ncarelessness in the heavenly drama, and its modification; the invention of the\ngem of reunion; and the final removal of the curse, even as modified. It is\ntrue that the Indian theatre permits no tragedy, and we may well believe that\nno successor of Kalidasa could hope to present a tragedy on the stage. But\nmight not Kalidasa, far overtopping his predecessors, have put on the stage a\ndrama the story of which was already familiar to his audience as a tragic\nstory? Perhaps not. If not, one can but wish that he had chosen another\nsubject.\n\nThis violent twisting of an essentially tragic story has had a further ill\nconsequence in weakening the individual characters. Pururavas is a mere\nconventional hero, in no way different from fifty others, in spite of his\ndivine lineage and his successful wooing of a goddess. Urvashi is too much of\na nymph to be a woman, and too much of a woman to be a nymph. The other\ncharacters are mere types.\n\nYet, in spite of these obvious objections, Hindu critical opinion has always\nrated the _Urvashi_ very high, and I have long hesitated to make adverse\ncomments upon it, for it is surely true that every nation is the best judge of\nits own literature. And indeed, if one could but forget plot and characters,\nhe would find in _Urvashi_ much to attract and charm. There is no lack of\nhumour in the clever maid who worms the clown\'s secret out of him. There is no\nlack of a certain shrewdness in the clown, as when he observes:\n\np. 120\n\n[paragraph continues] "Who wants heaven? It is nothing to eat or drink. It is\njust a place where they never shut their eyes--like fishes!"\n\nAgain, the play offers an opportunity for charming scenic display. The\nterrified nymphs gathered on the mountain, the palace balcony bathed in\nmoonlight, the forest through which the king wanders in search of his lost\ndarling, the concluding solemn consecration of the crown prince by heavenly\nbeings--these scenes show that Kalidasa was no closet dramatist. And finally,\nthere is here and there such poetry as only Kalidasa could write. The fourth\nact particularly, undramatic as it is, is full of a delicate beauty that\ndefies transcription. It was a new and daring thought--to present on the stage\na long lyrical monologue addressed to the creatures of the forest and inspired\nby despairing passion. Nor must it be forgotten that this play, like all\nIndian plays, is an opera. The music and the dancing are lost. We judge it\nperforce unfairly, for we judge it by the text alone. If, in spite of all, the\nUrvashi is a failure, it is a failure possible only to a serene and mighty\npoet.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Dynasty of Raghu](sha15.htm)\n\n'
