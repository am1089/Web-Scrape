Suta said :-- Hearing these words of the king, Vyasa Deva, the son\nSatyavati addressed to him before the assembly, thus :-- \xc2\x93O king! I am now\nreciting to you a Bhagavata Pura _n_ a, holy, wonderful, filled with many\nanecdotes, and leading to auspicious results; listen. Before I made my son\nS'uka study this Pura _n_ a; O king! I will now recite before you that highest\nPura _n_ a, with all the secrets contained therein. I have extracted this from\nall the \xc3\x82gamas; it brings in Dharma (religion), Artha (wealth), Kama\n(fructification of desires) and Mok _s_ a (liberation); hearing this gives\nalways happiness and good results.\n\n\n\n5-6. At this Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Whose son is this Muni \xc3\x82stika? Why\ndid he come as an obstacle in my Sarpa Yaj\xc3\xb1a (sacrifice of snakes)? And what\nobject had he in preserving the snakes? O highly fortunate one! Kindly\ndescribe all this in detail; after this recite the Pura _n_ a, also, in detail\nto me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7-18. Vyasa Deva said :-- \xc2\x93O king! In former days there lived a Muni named\nJaratkaru. He always remained in the path of peace; and did not marry. Once he\nsaw, in a cave in a forest, his fathers and forefathers pendant. They spoke to\nJaratkaru thus :-- \xc2\x93O son! Marry; we will thereby be greatly pleased; if there\nbe a son of good character born to you, we all will be freed from all troubles\nand we would then able to go to Heavens.\xc2\x94 Hearing this Jaratkaru said :-- \xc2\x93O\nForefathers! If I get a girl of my name, without begging and asking and if she\nbe entirely obedient to me, I will marry and lead a householder's life; thus\n\n\n\np. 116\n\n\n\nI have spoken truly to you.\xc2\x94 Thus saying to his forefathers, Jaratkaru went on\ntour to the holy places. Now it happened so, that at that very time Kadru, the\nmother of snakes cursed her sons, saying \xc2\x93May you be burnt by fire.\xc2\x94 The\nmatters of this incident run as follows :-- \xc2\x93At that moment Kadru and Vinata,\nthe two co-wives of Kas'yapa saw the horses yoked in the chariot of the sun\nand thus argued with each other :-- Kadru, seeing the sun's horse, first asked\nVinata \xc2\x93O good one! Tell me soon, what is the colour of this horse?\xc2\x94 Vinata\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O auspicious one! What do you think?\xc2\x94 I said, the colour of the\nhorse is white; you also better say before hand what is its colour? We will\nthen lay a wager (and challenge). Kadru said :-- \xc2\x93O Smiling one! I think the\nthe horse is black. Now come; let us challenge; whoever will be defeated will\nbecome the slave of the other.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, Kadru told her sons that were\nobedient :-- \xc2\x93Cover by your bodies all the pores of the body of the horse of\nthe chariot of the Sun, so it may look black; go and do it.\xc2\x94 At this some\nsnakes replied \xc2\x93That cannot be.\xc2\x94 Kadru then cursed them saying :-- \xc2\x93Let you\nfall on the sacrificial fire of Janamejaya.\xc2\x94 Then the other snakes tried to\nplease their mother and coiled round the back of that horse so that the horse\nbegan to look black. Kadru and Vinata, the two co-wives went together and saw\nthe horse. Vinata saw it black and became very sorry.\n\n\n\n19-21. Now, Garu _d_ a, Vinata's son, very powerful and devourer of snakes was\npassing that way and seeing his mother very __ distressed asked her :-- \xc2\x93O\nMother! Why do you look so very sorry? It seems as if you are weeping. Aru _n_\na, the charioteer of the Sun and I myself are your two sons living. Fie to us\nthat, while we are living, you will have to suffer pains. O beautiful one! If\nmother suffers while the son is living, then what use is there in having such\na son? So, O Mother, give out the cause of your grief and I will remove it at\nonce.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22-31. Hearing this Vinata said :-- \xc2\x93O son! What shall I say to you of my\nmisery; I am now become the slave of my rival wife. By some pretext she\ndefeated me and is now telling me to carry her on my back. O son! For this\nreason I am sorry.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of the mother, Garuda said :-- \xc2\x93Very\nwell I will carry her on my shoulders wherever she wishes to go. O auspicious\none! You need not be sorry; I will remove all your cares.\xc2\x94 Vyasa Deva said :--\nThus spoken to by Garu _d_ a, Vinata went to Kadru. At that time the highly\npowerful Garu _d_ a went there also to free his mother of her slavery and\ncarried Kadru with all her sons on his back to the other side of the ocean.\nWhen Garu _d_ a went across the ocean, Garu _d_ a spoke to Kadru :-- \xc2\x93O\nmother! I bow down to thee; kindly say how my mother can be freed\n\n\n\np. 117\n\n\n\nof your slavery. Hearing this Kadru said :-- \xc2\x93O son! If you can bring to-day\nby your sheer force nectar from the Deva loka and give it to my sons then you\nwill be able to free your helpless mother. When Kadru said so, the highly\npowerful Vinata's son, Garu _d_ a immediately went to the abode of Indra and,\nfighting hard, stole away the jar of nectar and brought and gave it to Kadru\nand freed his mother Vinata from the slavery of Kadru. In the meantime, the\nsnakes went for their bath, after which they would drink the nectar. Indra\nstole away that jar which contained nectar. O king! Thus, by the sheer\nstrength of arms of Garu _d_ a Vinata was freed of her slavery. On the other\nhand, when the snakes returned from their bath and found that there was no jar\nof nectar, they began to lick the Ku _s_ a grass over which the jar of nectar\nwas kept, thinking that they would thereby get some drops of nectar which\nmight have trickled over; and the result was that by the sharp edges of ku _s_\na grasses, the tongues of all the snakes were cut asunder into two; hence the\nsnakes are called Dvijihva.\n\n\n\n32-36. The snake Vasuki and others, whom Kadru, the mother of snakes, cursed,\nwent to Brahma and took his refuge and informed all of the cause of their\nterror, the curse from their mother; when Brahma spoke to them :-- \xc2\x93Go and\ngive the sister of Vasuki, named Jaratkaru, in marriage to the great Muni\nJarat Karu, (both of the same name). In her womb, a son named \xc3\x82stika will be\nborn; and he will certainly deliver you from your difficulties. Hearing those\nbeneficial words of Brahma, Vasuki went to the forest and requested humbly the\ngreat Muni Jarat Karu to accept in marriage her own sister when the Muni,\nknowing the girl to be of his name, spoke out thus :-- \xc2\x93But when your sister\nwill act against my wishes, I will forsake her at once.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n37-46. Under these conditions, the Muni married her. And Vasuki, after giving\nher sister in marriage according to her own wishes to the Muni, returned to\nher own abode. O Tormentor of foes! Then the Muni Jaratkaru built a white hut\nof leaves in that great forest and began to pass his days happily in enjoyment\nwith his wife. Once, on an occasion, after he had taken his dinner he slept\nand told his wife not to awaken him under any circumstances and fell fast\nasleep. The beautiful sister of Vasuki sat by his side. When the evening time\ncame and the sun began to set, the Vasuki's sister Jaratkaru became afraid at\nthe thought that the evening Sandhya might not be performed by the Muni and\nthought thus :-- \xc2\x93What am I to do now? My heart finds not rest if I do not\nawaken him; and if I awaken him, he will forsake me at once. Now if I do not\nawaken him, the evening will pass away to no purpose. Whatever it be, if he\nquits me or if my death ensues, that is better than the non-observance of\nDharma; for when Dharma is destroyed, hell ensues.\n\n\n\np. 118\n\n\n\nThus thinking, the girl awakened him saying :-- \xc2\x93O One of good vows! It is\nevening time; so get up; etc.\xc2\x94 The Muni got up in great anger and addressed\nhis wife :-- \xc2\x93When you have disturbed my sleep, I now go away from you; you\nalso better go to your brother's house.\xc2\x94 When the Muni said so, Vasuki's\nsister spoke out, trembling :-- \xc2\x93O One of indomitable lustre! How will the\nobject be served for which my brother has given me in marriage with you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n47-50. The Muni then spoke firmly to his wife Jaratkaru :-- \xc2\x93That is within\nyour womb.\xc2\x94 Jaratkaru then, forsaken by the Muni, went to the abode of Vasuki.\nWhen her brother Vasuki asked her about her son, she said :-- \xc2\x93The Muni has\nforsaken me, saying that the son is within your womb.\xc2\x94 At this Vasuki trusted;\nand said :-- \xc2\x93The Muni won't ever tell lies\xc2\x94 and gave shelter to his sister. O\nKurusattama! After some time, a famous boy named the Muni \xc3\x82stika was born.\n\n\n\n51-56. O king! That Muni boy, the knower of truth, had desisted you __ from\nyour sacrifice of snakes for the preservation of his mother's family. It is\nwell and good, befitting you, that you respected the words of the Muni \xc3\x82stika,\nborn of Yayavara family and the cousin of Vasuki. O Mighty-armed! Let all\nauspiciousness come to you; you have heard the whole Mahabharata and gave away\nlots of things in charities. You have worshipped innumerable Munis. But, O\nking! Though you have done so many good things, yet your father has not\nattained heaven and you have not been able to sanctify your family. So, O king\nJanamejaya! Now install a capacious temple of the Devi with the highest\ndevotion; then all your desires will be fulfilled. The all auspicious Devi,\nthe Giver of all desires, makes the kingdoms more stable and increases the\nfamily, if She be always worshipped with the highest devotion.\n\n\n\n57-64. O king! You better perform duly the Devimakha Yaj\xc3\xb1a Yoti _st_ oma and\nothers, pleasing to the Devi, and hear the great Pura _n_ a S\xc2\x92rimad Devi\nBhagavatam, filled with accounts of the glorious deeds of the Devi. I will\nmake you hear now that Divine Pura _n_ a, filled with various sentiments,\nhighly sanctifying and capable to carry one across this ocean of world. O\nking! There is no other subject in this world worthy to be heard than the\nabove Pura _n_ a and there is no other thing to be worshipped then the lotus\nfeet of the Devi. O king! Those are certainly fortunate, those are intelligent\nand blessed, in whose hearts of love and devotion reign always the Devi\nBhagavati. O illustrious scion of Bharata's family! Know them to the always\nafflicted with troubles who do not worship in this world the great Mother\nMahamaya. O king! Who is there that will not worship Her when Brahma and all\nthe Devas\n\n\n\np. 119\n\n\n\nare always engaged in Her devotional service. O king! He who hears always this\nPura _n_ a gets all his desires fulfilled; in former days Bhagavati Herself\nspoke this excellent Pura _n_ a to Vi _sn_ u. O king! Your heart will be\nappeased and become peaceful when you hear this; and, as a result of your\nhearing this Pura _n_ am, all your ancestors will attain endless Heavenly\nlife.\n\n\n\nThus ends the Twelfth Chapter of the Second Skandha on the birth of \xc3\x82stika in\nthe Mahapura _n_ am S'rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa. Here ends as well the Second Book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 1](bk03ch01.htm)\n\n"
