Charm against poison.\n\n1\\. The Brahmana was the first to be born, with ten heads and ten mouths. He\nwas the first to drink the soma; that did render poison powerless.  \n2\\. As great as heaven and earth are in extent, as far as the seven streams\ndid spread, so far from here have I proclaimed forth this charm that destroys\npoison.  \n3\\. The eagle Garutmant did, O poison, first devour thee. Thou didst not\nbewilder him, didst not injure him, yea, thou didst turn into food for him.  \n4\\. The five-fingered hand that did hurl upon thee (the arrow) even from the\ncurved bow--from the point of the tearing (arrow) have I charmed away the\npoison.  \n5\\. From the point (of the arrow) have I charmed away the poison, from the\nsubstance that has been smeared upon it, and from its plume. From its barbed\nhorn, and its neck, I have charmed away the poison.  \n6\\. Powerless, O arrow, is thy point, and powerless is thy poison. Moreover of\npowerless wood is thy powerless bow, O powerless (arrow)!  \n7\\. They that ground (the poison), they that daubed it on, they that hurled\nit, and they that let it go, all these have been rendered impotent. The\nmountain that grows poisonous plants has been rendered impotent.  \n8\\. Impotent are they that dig thee, impotent art thou, O plant! Impotent is\nthat mountain height whence this poison has sprung.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 7. Charm against poison](av039.htm)\n\n'
