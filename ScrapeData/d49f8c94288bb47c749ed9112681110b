Pra _k_ ina _s_ ala Aupamanyava, Satyaya _g_ \xc3\xb1a Paulushi, Indradyumna\nBhallaveya, _G_ ana _S_ arkarakshya, and Bu _d_ ila \xc3\x82 _s_ vatara _s_ vi, these\nfive great householders and great theologians came once together and held a\ndiscussion as to What is our Self, and what is Brahman 2.\n\n2\\.
