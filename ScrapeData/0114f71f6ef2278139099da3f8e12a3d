O Indra, a thousand have been thy helps accorded to us, a thousand, O\ndriver of the bays, have been thy most delightful viands. May thousands of\ntreasures richly to enjoy, may goods [1](sbe3228.htm#an_1:167:1:1) come to us\na thousandfold.\n\n2\\. May the Maruts come towards us with their aids, the mighty ones, or with\ntheir best aids from the great heaven, now that their furthest steeds have\nrushed forth on the distant shore of the sea;\n\n3\\. There clings [1](sbe3228.htm#an_1:167:3:1) to the Maruts one who moves in\nsecret, like a man's wife (the lightning [2](sbe3228.htm#an_1:167:3:2)), and\nwho is like a spear carried behind [3](sbe3228.htm#an_1:167:3:3), well\ngrasped, resplendent, gold-adorned; there is also with them Va _k_ (the voice\nof thunder), like unto a courtly, eloquent woman.\n\n4\\. Far away the brilliant, untiring Maruts cling to their young maid, as if\nshe belonged to them all [1](sbe3228.htm#an_1:167:4:1); but the terrible ones\ndid not drive away Rodasi (the lightning), for they wished her to grow\n[2](sbe3228.htm#an_1:167:4:2) their friend.\n\n5\\. When the divine Rodasi with dishevelled locks, the manly-minded, wished to\nfollow them, she went, like Surya (the Dawn), to the chariot of her servant,\nwith terrible look, as with the pace of a cloud.\n\n6\\. As soon as the poet with the libations, O Maruts, had sung his song, at\nthe sacrifice, pouring out Soma, the youthful men (the Maruts) placed the\nyoung maid (in their chariot) as their companion for victory, mighty in\nassemblies.\n\np. 273\n\n7\\. I praise what is the praiseworthy true greatness of those Maruts, that the\nmanly-minded, proud, and strong one (Rodasi) drives with them towards the\nblessed mothers.\n\n8\\. They protect [1](sbe3228.htm#an_1:167:8:1) Mitra and Varu _n_ a from the\nunspeakable, and Aryaman also finds out the infamous. Even what is firm and\nunshakable is being shaken [2](sbe3228.htm#an_1:167:8:2); but he who dispenses\ntreasures [3](sbe3228.htm#an_1:167:8:3), O Maruts, has grown (in strength).\n\n9\\. No people indeed, whether near to us, or from afar, have ever found the\nend of your strength, O Maruts! The Maruts, strong in daring strength, have,\nlike the sea, boldly [1](sbe3228.htm#an_1:167:9:1) surrounded their haters.\n\n10\\. May we to-day, may we to-morrow in battle be called the most beloved of\nIndra. We were so formerly, may we truly be so day by day, and may the lord of\nthe Maruts be with us.\n\n11\\. May this praise, O Maruts, this song of Mandarya, the son of Mana, the\npoet, ask you with food for offspring for ourselves! May we have an\ninvigorating autumn, with quickening rain!\n\np. 274\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Agastya, addressed to the Maruts, but the first verse to Indra.\nMetre Trish _t_ ubh throughout.\n\nNo verse of this hymn occurs in the Sama-veda, nor in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. We must keep va _g_ a, as a general term, distinct from a _s_ va,\nhorses, and go, cows, for the poets themselves distinguish between gavyanta\n_h_ , a _s_ vayanta _h_ , and va _g_ ayanta _h_ ; see IV, 17, 16; VI, 8, 6.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. On mimyaksha, see before, I, 165, 1, note 2.\n\nNote 2. The spear of the Maruts is meant for the lightning, and we actually\nfind _ri_ sh _t_ i-vidyuta _h_ , having the lightning for their spear, as an\nepithet of the Maruts, I, 168, 5; V, 52, 13.\n\nThe rest of this verse is difficult, and has been variously rendered by\ndifferent scholars. We must remember that the lightning is represented as the\nwife or the beloved of the Maruts. In that character she is called Rodasi\xc2\xb4,\nwith the accent on the last syllable, and kept distinct from rodasi, the dual,\nwith the accent on the antepenultimate, which means heaven and earth.\n\nThis Rodasi\xc2\xb4 occurs:\n\nV, 56, 8. a\xc2\xb4 yasmin tasthau su-ra _n_ ani bibhrati sa _k_ a marutsu rodasi\xc2\xb4.\n\nThe chariot on which, carrying pleasant gifts, stands Rodasi among the Maruts.\n\nVI, 50, 5. mimyaksha yeshu rodasi\xc2\xb4 nu devi\xc2\xb4.\n\nTo whom clings the divine Rodasi.\n\nVI, 66, 6. adha sma eshu rodasi\xc2\xb4 sva- _s_ o _k_ i _h_ a\xc2\xb4 amavatsu tasthau na\nroka _h_.\n\nWhen they (the Maruts) had joined the two Rodas, i. e. heaven and earth, then\nthe self-brilliant Rodasi came among the strong ones.\n\nThe name of Rodasi, heaven and earth, is so much more frequent in the Rig-veda\nthan that of Rodasi\xc2\xb4, that in\n\np. 275\n\nseveral passages the iti which stands after duals, has been wrongly inserted\nafter Rodasi\xc2\xb4 in the singular. It is so in our hymn, verse 4, where we must\nread rodasi\xc2\xb4m instead of rodasi\xc2\xb4 iti, and again in X, 92, 11.\n\nBesides the lightning, however, the thunder also may be said to be in the\ncompany of the Maruts, to be their friend or their wife, and it is this double\nrelationship which seems to be hinted at in our hymn.\n\nThe thunder is called Va _k_ , voice, the voice of heaven, also called by the\nauthor of the Anukrama _n_ i, \xc3\x82mbh _ri_ _n_ i. It was natural to identify this\nambh _ri_ _n_ a with Greek \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xb2\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, terrible, particularly as it is used of\nthe thunder, \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xb2\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xb2\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xb7\xcf\x83\xce\xb5, Hes. Th. 839, and is applied to Athene as\n\xe1\xbd\x80\xce\xb2\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xce\xbf-\xcf\x80\xce\xac\xcf\x84\xcf\x81\xce\xb7. But there are difficulties pointed out by Curtius, Grundzuge,\np. 532, which have not yet been removed. This Va _k_ says of herself (X, 125,\n12) that she stretched the bow for Rudra, the father of the Maruts, that her\nbirth-place is in the waters (clouds), and that she fills heaven and earth.\nSee also X, 114, 8.\n\nIn I, 173, 3. anta _h_ duta _h_ na rodasi _k_ arat va\xc2\xb4k.\n\nThe voice (thunder) moved between heaven and earth, like a messenger.\n\nIn VIII, 100, 10 and 11, after it has been said that the thunderbolt lies\nhidden in the water, the poet says: yat va\xc2\xb4k vadanti avi- _k_ etana\xc2\xb4ni ra\xc2\xb4sh\n_t_ ri deva\xc2\xb4nam ni-sasa\xc2\xb4da mandra, when the voice, the queen of the gods, the\ndelightful, uttering incomprehensible sounds, sat down. If, in our verse, we\ntake Va _k_ in the sense of thunder, but as a feminine, it seems to me that\nthe poet, speaking of the lightning and thunder as the two companions of the\nMaruts, represents the first, Rodasi, or the lightning, as the recognised\nwife.. hiding herself in the house, while the other, the loud thunder. is\nrepresented as a more public companion of the Maruts, distinctly called\nvidatheshu pa _g_ ra (verse 6), a good speaker at assemblies. This contrast,\nif it is really what the poet intended, throws a curious light on the social\ncharacter of the Vedic times, as it presupposes two classes of wives, not\nnecessarily simultaneous, however,--a house-wife, who stays at home and is not\nmuch seen, and a wife who appears in\n\np. 276\n\npublic and takes part in the society and conversation of the sabha, the\nassembly-room, and the vidathas, the meetings. The loud voice of the thunder\nas well as the usual hiding of the lightning might well suggest this\ncomparison. That good manners, such as are required in public, and ready\nspeech, were highly esteemed in Vedic times, we learn from such words as\nsabheya and vidathya\xcc\x83. Sabheya, from sabha, assembly, court, comes to mean\ncourtly, polite; vidathya\xcc\x83, from vidatha, assembly, experienced, learned.\n\nVIII, 4, 9. _k_ andra _h_ yati sabha\xc2\xb4m upa.\n\nThy friend, Indra, goes brilliant towards the assembly.\n\nX, 34, 6. sabha\xc2\xb4m eti kitava _h_.\n\nThe gambler goes to the assembly.\n\nVI, 28, 6. b _ri_ hat va _h_ vaya _h_ u _k_ yate sabha\xc2\xb4su.\n\nYour great strength is spoken of in the assemblies.\n\nWealth is described as consisting in sabhas, houses, IV, 2, 5; and a friend is\ndescribed as sabhasaha, strong in the assembly, X, 71, 10.\n\nSabheya is used as an epithet of vipra (II, 24, 13), and a son is praised as\nsabheya, vidathya, and sadanya, i. e. as distinguished in the assemblies.\n\nVidathya\xcc\x83, in fact, means much the same as sabheya, namely, good for,\ndistinguished at vidathas, meetings for social, political, or religious\npurposes, IV, 21, 2; VII, 36, 8, &c.\n\nNote 3. \xc3\x9apara na _ri_ sh _t_ i _h_. I do not see how upara can here mean the\ncloud, if it ever has that meaning. I take upara as opposed to purva, i. e.\nbehind, as opposed to before. In that sense upara is used, X, 77, 3; X, 15, 2;\n44, 7, &c. It would therefore mean the spear on the back, or the spear drawn\nback before it is hurled forward.\n\nB. R. propose to read sa _m_ -vak, colloquium, but they give no explanation.\nThe reference to VS. IX, 2, is wrong.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The fourth verse carries on the same ideas which were hinted at in the\nthird. We must again change rodasi\xc2\xb4, the dual, into rodasi\xc2\xb4m, which is\nsufficiently indicated by the accent. Yavya I take as an instrumental of yavi,\nor of\n\np. 277\n\nyavya. It means the youthful maid, and corresponds to yuvati in verse 6. Yavya\nwould be the exact form which Curtius (Grundzuge, p. 589) postulated as the\nSanskrit prototype of Hebe a. Now, if the Maruts correspond to Mars in Latin,\nand to Ares in Greek, the fact that in the Iliad Hebe bathes and clothes Ares\nb, may be of some significance. Sadhara _n_ i is used in the sense of uxor\ncommunis, and would show a familiarity with the idea of polyandry recognised\nin the epic poetry of the Mahahharata.\n\nBut although the Maruts cling to this maid (the Vak, or thunder), they do not\ncast off Rodasi, their lawful wife, the lightning, but wish her to grow for\ntheir friendship, i. e. as their friend.\n\nAya\xc2\xb4sa _h_ yavya\xc2\xb4 must be scanned   \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84. In VI 66, 5, aya\xc2\xb4sa _h_\nmahna\xc2\xb4 must be scanned as   \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84 (mahimna?).\n\nNote 2. V _r i_dham, as the accent shows, is here an infinitive governed by\n_g_ ushanta.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nSee von Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p. 76.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nI translate arka by poet. The construction would become too cumbersome if we\ntranslated, 'as soon as the hymn with the libations was there for you, as soon\nas the sacrificer sang his song.'\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nThe meaning of the second line is obscure, unless we adopt Ludwig's ingenious\nview that Rodasi is here conceived as Eileithyia, the goddess who helps\nmothers in childbirth. I confess that it is a bold conjecture, and there is\nnothing in Vedic literature to support it. All I can say is that Eileithyia is\nin Greek, like Hebe (Yavya) and Ares (Marut), a child of Hera, and that\nlightning as well as dawn might become a symbol of birth. The etymology and\nthe\n\np. 278\n\nvery form of \xce\x95\xe1\xbc\xb0\xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xce\xaf\xce\xb8\xcf\x85\xce\xb9\xce\xb1 is doubtful, and so is that of Rodasi\xc2\xb4. It is tempting\nto connect rodasi, in the sense of heaven and earth, with O. S. radur, A. S.\nrodor (Grimm, Myth. p. 662), but that is impossible. Cf. I, 101, 7.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. I do not see how panti, the plural, can refer to Mitra and Varu _n_ a,\nnor how these gods could here be introduced as acting the part of the Maruts.\nI therefore refer panti to the Maruts, who may be said to protect Mitra and\nVaru _n_ a, day and night, and all that belongs to them, from evil and\ndisgrace. Aryaman is then brought in, as being constantly connected with\nMitra-varu _n_ au, and the finding out, the perceiving from a distance, of the\ninfamous enemies, who might injure Mitra-varu _n_ au, is parenthetically\nascribed to him. See Ludwig, Anmerkungen, p. 239.\n\nNote 2. _K_ yavante cannot and need not be taken for _k_ yavayanti, though a\n_k_ yuta _k_ ut is a common epithet of the Maruts. It is quite true that the\nshaking of the unshakable mountains is the work of the Maruts, but that is\nunderstood, even though it is not expressed. In V, 60, 3, we read, parvata _h_\n_k_ it mahi v _ri_ ddha _h_ bibhaya, even the very great mountain feared, i.\ne. the Maruts.\n\nNote 3. Dati in da\xc2\xb4tivara has been derived by certain Sanskrit scholars from\nda, to give. It means, no doubt, gift, but it is derived from da (do, dyati),\nto share, and means first, a share, and then a gift. Da\xc2\xb4tivara is applied to\nthe Maruts, V, 58, 2; III, 51, 9, and must therefore be applied to them in our\npassage also, though the construction becomes thereby extremely difficult. It\nmeans possessed of a treasure of goods which they distribute. The growing,\ntoo, which is here predicated by vav _ri_ dhe, leads us to think of the\nMaruts, as in I, 37, 5, or of their friend Indra, I, 52, 2; 81, I; VI, 30, 1.\nIt is never, so far as I know, applied to the sacrificer.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Dh _ri_ shata\xc2\xb4 is used as an adverb; see I, 71, 5; 174, 4; II, 30, 4,\n&c. Perhaps tmana may be supplied as in I, 54, 4.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[277:a](sbe3228.htm#fr_121) Wir mussen ein vorgriechisches yava oder\nmoglicherweise yavya annehmen.\n\n[277:b](sbe3228.htm#fr_122) Il.
