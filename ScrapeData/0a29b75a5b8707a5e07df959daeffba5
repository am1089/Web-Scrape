A kuntapa-hymn.\n\n### A.\n\n1\\. Listen, ye folks, to this: (a song) in praise of a hero shall be sung! Six\nthousand and ninety (cows) did we get (when we were) with Kaurama among the\nRusamas,--  \n2\\. Whose twice ten buffaloes move right along, touether with their cows; the\nheight of his chariot just misses the heaven which recedes from its touch.  \n3\\. This one (Kaurama) presented the seer with a hundred jewels, ten chaplets,\nthree hundred steeds, and ten thousand cattle.\n\n### B.\n\n4\\. Disport thyself, O chanter, disport thyself as a bird upon a flowering\ntree; thy tongue glides quickly over the lips as a razor over the strop.  \n5\\. The chanters with their pious song hurry on blithely as cows; at home are\ntheir children, and at home the cows do they attend.  \n6\\. Bring hither, O chanter, thy poem, that which earns cattle and earns good\nthings! Among the gods (kings) place thy voice as a manly archer his arrow!\n\n### C.\n\n7\\. Listen ye to the high praise of the king who rules over all peoples, the\ngod who is above mortals, of Vaisvanara Parikshit!  \n8\\. 'Parikshit has procured for us a secure dwelling when he, the most\nexcellent one, weat to his seat.' (Thus) the husband in Kuru-land, when he\nfounds his household, converses with his wife.  \n9\\. 'What may I bring to thee, curds, stirred drink, or liquor?' (Thus) I the\nwife asks her husband in the kingdom of king Parikshit.  \n10\\. Like light the ripe barley runs over beyond the mouth (of the vessels).\nThe people thrive merrily in the kingdom of king Parikshit.\n\n### D.\n\n11\\. Indra has awakened the poet, saying: 'Arise, move about, and sing; of me,\nthe strong, verily, sing the praises; full every pious one shall offer thee\n(sacrificial reward)!'  \n12\\. Here, O cattle, ye shall be born, here, ye horses, here, ye domestics!\nAnd Pushan also, who bestows a thousand (cows) as sacrificial reward, settles\ndown here.  \n13\\. May these cattle, O Indra, not suffer harm, and may their owner not\nsuffer harm; may the hostile folk, O Indra, may the thief not gain possession\nof them!  \n14\\. We shout to the hero with hymn and song we (shout) with a pleasing song.\nTake delight in our songs; may we not ever suffer harm!\n\n# X.\n\n# COSMOGONIC AND THEOSOPHIC HYMNS.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 1.
