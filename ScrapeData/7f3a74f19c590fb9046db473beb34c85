The Highest, _G_ aimini thinks; on account of primariness of meaning.\n\nThe teacher _G_ aimini is of opinion that those deities lead on the souls of\nthose only who meditate on the highest Brahman. For in the text 'a person not\nhuman leads them to Brahman' the word Brahman is naturally taken in its\nprimary sense (i.e. the highest Brahman); the secondary sense (i.e. the\neffected Brahman) can be admitted only if there are other valid reasons to\nrefer the passage to the effected Brahman. And the alleged impossibility of\nthe soul's going is no such valid reason; for although Brahman no doubt is\npresent everywhere, Scripture declares that the soul of the wise frees itself\nfrom Nescience only on having gone to some particular place. That the\norigination of true knowledge depends on certain conditions of caste, a _s_\nrama, religious duty, purity of conduct, time, place, and so on, follows from\ncertain scriptural texts, as e.g. 'Brahma _n_ as desire to know him through\nthe study of the Veda' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22); in the same way it follows\nfrom the text declaring the soul's going to Brahman that the final realisation\nof that highest knowledge which implies the cessation of all Nescience depends\non\n\np. 751\n\nthe soul's going to some particular place. The arguments founded on texts\nalleged to declare that the soul of the wise does not pass out of the body at\nall we have refuted above. The argument that the specification implied in the\ntext which mentions _Brahman-worlds_ clearly points to the effected Brahman,\ni.e. Hira _n_ yagarbha, is equally invalid. For the compound 'the Brahman-\nworld' is to be explained as'the world which is Brahman'; just as according to\nthe Purva Mima _m_ sa the compound 'Nishada-sthapati' denotes a sthapati who\nis a Nishada (not a sthapati of the Nishadas). A thing even which is known as\none only may be designated by a plural form, as in a mantra one girdle is\nspoken of as 'the fetters of Aditi.' And as to the case under discussion, we\nknow on the authority of Scripture, Sm _ri_ ti, Itihasa, and Pura _n_ a, that\nthe wonderful worlds springing from the mere will of a perfect and omnipresent\nbeing cannot be but infinite.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 12.
