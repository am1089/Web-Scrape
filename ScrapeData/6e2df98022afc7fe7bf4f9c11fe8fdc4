Usurers.\n\n* 110. 110 Thus has the rule been declared for the interest to be paid on loans offered through friendship. If, however, interest be demanded on grain, at the rate which has been mentioned, it is termed usury.\n\n* 111. 111 A Vai _s_ ya is at liberty to get over a period of distress by practising usury. A Brahman must never resort to usury, not even in the extremity of distress.\n\np. 69\n\n* 112. 112 If a debt is due to a (dead) Brahman creditor, whose issue is living, (it must be paid to them.) If there be no issue, the king must cause the debt to be paid to his kinsmen; on failure of kinsmen (it must be paid) to his relatives.\n\n* 113. 113 Where there are neither kinsmen, nor relatives, nor distant connexions, it shall be paid to (other) Brahmans. On failure of such, he must cast it into the waters.\n\n* 114. 114 When a creditor receives payment, he must give a receipt for it to the debtor. If he does not give a receipt, although he has been asked for it, he shall lose the remainder of the sum due to him.\n\n* 115. 115 If, though pressed by the debtor, he does not give an acquittance for the sum paid to him by the debtor, that sum shall yield interest to the debtor (henceforth), as (it had done) to the creditor (previously).\n\np. 70\n\n* 116. 116 On payment of the debt, he must restore the bond. On failure of a bond, he must give a written receipt. Thus the creditor and debtor will be quits.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[68:108](sbe3313.htm#fr_203) The chattels, which have been mentioned in the\npreceding paragraph, if lent in amicable intercourse, shall not yield any\ninterest before the expiration of six months, without a special stipulation to\nthat effect. Even without a stipulation to that effect, however, they shall\nyield interest after the lapse of six months. A.\n\n[68:109](sbe3313.htm#fr_204) A loan which is not restored, on demand even,\nshall yield interest at the rate of 5 per cent. from that day forward, even\nthough six months are not yet over. A.\n\n[68:110](sbe3314.htm#fr_205) The term karman is sometimes used as an\nequivalent for gold. A. This interpretation has not been followed.\n\n[68:111](sbe3314.htm#fr_206) Agriculture, the tending of cattle, &c., are\nlawful occupations for a Vai _s_ ya. Lending money at interest is also\npermitted to him. Therefore it is said here that a Vai _s_ ya may practise\nusury in times of distress, whereas a Brahman must not resort to usury even in\ntimes of overwhelming distress. A.\n\n[69:112](sbe3314.htm#fr_207) Sakulya, 'kinsman,' is derived from kulya, 'a\nbone,' and denotes those who have their bones in common (sic), i.e. a father,\na paternal uncle, their sons, and other (agnates). Bandhu, 'a relative,'\ndenotes a mother, a sister, a sister's son, and other (agnates). A.\n\n[69:113](sbe3314.htm#fr_208) This paragraph is intended to show the pre-\neminence of the Brahman caste. A.\n\n[69:114](sbe3314.htm#fr_209) In Colebrooke's Digest (I, 6, 287) the second\nhalf of this paragraph is referred to a refusal on the part of the creditor to\nrestore the money, which the debtor had asked him for, on his refusing to give\na receipt. This construction is based on the comment of _G_ agannatha, but it\nis not countenanced by the remarks of Asahaya, and is thoroughly artificial.\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 93; Vish _n_ u VI, 26.\n\n[69:115](sbe3314.htm#fr_210) If the creditor fails to receipt the sum which\nhas been restored to him, on the back of the document, it shall yield interest\nto the debtor, in the same way as it had yielded interest to the creditor\npreviously. A.\n\n[70:116](sbe3314.htm#fr_211) Where the bond is no longer in existence, because\nit has been stolen or destroyed, or met with some calamity, the creditor,\ninstead of it, shall give a written receipt to the debtor. Here ends the sixth\nsection of the law of debt, which treats of lending money at interest and of\nusurers. A.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8. Sureties](sbe3315.htm)\n\n"
