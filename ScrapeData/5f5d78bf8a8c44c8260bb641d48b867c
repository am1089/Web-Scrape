FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n7:1:1:11\\. Being about to build the Garhapatya (fire-place), he sweeps (its\nsite) with a Pala _s_ a (butea frondosa) branch. For when he builds the\nGarhapatya 1 he settles on that place; and whatsoever builders of fire-altars\n(there have been), they are indeed settled on this earth; and when he sweeps\n(that place) he thereby sweeps away those settled (there before hire),\nthinking, 'Lest I should settle on those already settled (here).'\n\n7:1:1:22\\. [He sweeps, with Va _g_. S. XII, 45] 'Off with you! away with you!\ncrawl away from here 2!'--that is, 'Go off, go away, and crawl away from\nhere!' he says this to those that crawl on their belly;--'Ye that are here of\nold and of late!' that is, 'both ye who were here of yore, and ye of the\npresent day.'\n\n7:1:1:33\\. 'Yama hath given the settlement on earth (to this Sacrificer);'--\nfor Yama indeed rules over the settling on this earth, and it is he who grants\nto this (Sacrificer) a settlement on this earth.\n\np. 299\n\n7:1:1:44\\. 'The Fathers have prepared this place for him!' for Yama is the\nKshatra (nobility, or ruling power), and the Fathers (deceased ancestors) are\nthe clansmen; and to whomsoever the chief (kshatriya), with the approval of\nthe clan, grants a settlement, that (settlement) is properly given: and in\nlike manner does Yama, the ruling power, with the consent of the Fathers, the\nclan, now grant to this (Sacrificer) a settlement on this earth.\n\n7:1:1:55\\. With a pala _s_ a branch he sweeps; for the Pala _s_ a tree is the\nBrahman 1: it is by the Brahman he thus sweeps away those already\nsettled;--with a prayer (he does so), for the prayer is the Brahman: it is by\nthe Brahman he thus sweeps away those already settled. He throws it (the\nbranch) out towards the north 2.\n\n7:1:1:66\\. He then scatters saline soil (over the hearth-site); for the\nGarhapatya is this world, and salt means cattle: he thus bestows cattle on\nthis world,--hence those cattle here in this world.\n\n7:1:1:77\\. And again why he scatters saline soil. Pra _g_ apati created\ncreatures; he created them with different kinds of amnions: they did not agree\ntogether. He desired, 'May they agree together!' He made them to be of the\nsame (kind of) amnion: hence even to this day, being of equal amnions, they\nagree together. And he who offers, offers thinking, 'May I be (born) with the\nsame (kind of) amnion as the gods!' and when he scatters saline salt (in the\nhearth-site) he thereby becomes of equal amnion with the gods.\n\np. 300\n\n7:1:1:88\\. [He does so, with Va _g_. S. XII, 46] 'Concord thou art!' for\nthereby they agreed together 1;--'fulfilment of desire;' for salt is cattle,\nand fulfilment of desire means cattle;--'In me may there be the fulfilment of\nthy desire!' that is, 'May there be on me cattle for thee!'--He covers with it\nthe whole (circular) Garhapatya; for the Garhapatya altar is the womb, and the\nsaline soil is the amnion: he thus covers the whole womb with the amnion.\n\n7:1:1:99\\. He then scatters sand to keep (the saline soil, or amnion) from\nbeing scorched 2;--for sand is nothing else than the ashes of Agni Vai _s_\nvanara, and him, Agni Vai _s_ vanara, he is indeed about to build up; and Agni\ndoes not scorch his own self.\n\n7:1:1:1010\\. And again why he scatters sand,--sand is nothing else than the\nseed of Agni Vai _s_ vanara 3, and him, Agni Vai _s_ vanara, he is about to\nbuild up; but nothing is fashioned from out of the seedless: 'May he (Agni) be\nfashioned from out of this seed!' so he thinks.\n\n7:1:1:1111\\. [He scatters it, with Va _g_. S. XII, 46] 'Agni's ashes thou art!\nAgni's soil thou art!' for Agni's ashes are useless, and the sand is not\nuseless: he thus makes it (the Garhapatya hearth) to be useful. He covers with\nit the whole Garhapatya; for the\n\np. 301\n\n[paragraph continues] Garhapatya altar is the womb, and the sand is seed: he\nthus fills the whole womb with seed.\n\n7:1:1:1212\\. He then encloses it with enclosing-stones; for the enclosing-\nstones are the womb: he thus encloses the seed here cast in the womb; and\nhence the seed which is cast is enclosed in the womb.\n\n7:1:1:1313\\. And, again, why he encloses it with enclosing-stones;--the\nGarhapatya hearth is this (terrestrial) world, and the enclosing-stones are\nthe waters: he thus surrounds this world with water,--it is with the ocean\nthat he thus surrounds it on all sides, and hence the ocean flows round this\nworld on all sides. (He puts up the stones) by turning to the right (or south)\n1, whence the ocean flows round this world (from the east) southwards;--by\nmeans of a dug out (hole, or moat) 2, whence the ocean flows round this world\nin a moat.\n\n7:1:1:1414\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 46] 'Ranging ye are!' for he does range\nthem;--'ranging around ye are!' for he does range them all round;--'upwards\nranging get ye fixed!' thus he says, placing them upright: hence the ocean\nsurges upwards; but were he to place them sideways, the ocean surely would all\nat once overflow all this (earth). He does not settle them, for unsettled are\nthe waters; nor does he pronounce the Sudadohas (verse) on them 3.\n\np. 302\n\n7:1:1:1515\\. For the enclosing-stones are the bones, and the Sudadohas is the\nbreath; and there is no breath in the bones. With one and the same formula he\nlays down many bricks 1, for of one and the same form are the waters; and as\nto there being many enclosing-stones, it is because there are many waters.\n\n7:1:1:1616\\. The enclosing-stones, then, are the womb; the saline earth is the\namnion, and the sand is the seed. The enclosing-stones are outside, and the\nsaline earth is inside; for the womb is outside, and the amnion inside. The\nsaline earth is outside, and the sand inside; for the amnion is outside, and\nthe seed inside. He who is born is born from these: it is from them that he\nthus causes him (Agni) to be born.\n\n7:1:1:1717\\. Thereon he now builds it (the hearth): he\n\n![G\xc3\x82RHAPATYA HEARTH.](img/30200.jpg)  \nG\xc3\x82RHAPATYA HEARTH.\n\nthereby fashions that infused seed; and hence the infused seed is fashioned in\nthe womb.\n\np. 303\n\n7:1:1:1818\\. He puts on (the circular site) four (bricks) running eastwards 1;\ntwo behind running crosswise (from south to north), and two (such) in front.\nNow the four which he puts on running eastwards are the body; and as to there\nbeing four of these, it is because this body (of ours) consists, of four parts\n2. The two at the back then are the thighs; and the two in front the arms; and\nwhere the body is that (includes) the head.\n\n7:1:1:1919\\. Now he here fashions him (Agni) with wings and tail; for whatlike\nthe seed is fashioned in the womb suchlike (offspring) is born: thus inasmuch\nas he now fashions him with wings and tail, he is born hereafter 3 with wings\nand tail.\n\n7:1:1:2020\\. While being indeed furnished with wings and tail, people do not\nsee him as one having wings and tail 4: hence one does not see the child in\nthe womb in its proper shape; but hereafter they (will) see him as one having\nwings and tail, and hence one sees the child after it is born in its proper\nshape.\n\n7:1:1:2121\\. Four (bricks) he puts on first, for of him that\n\np. 304\n\nis being produced it is the body (trunk) that is produced first. Sitting south\n(of the hearth-site) with his face to the north he puts on first one (brick)\nof the upper (north) part 1 (of the trunk); and in this manner that Agni of\nhis comes to be built up towards (or for the Sacrificer) himself.\n\n7:1:1:2222\\. [He puts it on, with Va _g_. S. XII, 47; _Ri_ k S. III, 22, 1,\n&c.] 'This is the Agni wherein Indra taketh the Soma-juice,' for the\nGarhapatya hearth is this (terrestrial) world, and the Soma-juice is the\nwaters: Indra thus took up the waters in this world;--'into his belly, craving\nit,'--for the belly is the centre;--'thousandfold strength, like a swift\nracer,'--the thousandfold strength, doubtless, is the waters,--'thou, having\ngained, art exalted, O knower of beings!' that is, 'thou, being built, art\nbuilt 2, O knower of beings!'\n\n7:1:1:2323\\. [The second brick, with Va _g_. S. XII, 48] 'O Agni, what\nsplendour is thine in the heaven,'--his splendour in the heaven doubtless is\nthe sun;--'on earth,' that on earth is this fire;--'and that which is in the\nplants, in the waters, O holy one!' he thereby means the fire that is both in\nthe plants, and in the waters;--'wherewith thou hast overspread the wide air,'\n--that is, the wind;--'brilliant is that light, surging, man-viewing;' that\nis, 'great is that light, surging, man-viewing.'\n\n7:1:1:2424\\. [The third, with Va _g_ . S. XII, 49] 'O Agni,\n\np. 305\n\nthou goest up to the flood of the heaven;' the flood of that heaven doubtless\nis the waters (of the atmosphere): to them he goes by his smoke;--'hither\ncallest thou the divine inspirers,'--the divine inspirers doubtless are the\nvital airs, for these inspire all thoughts;--'the waters approach (thee), they\nthat are beyond the luminous sphere of the sun, and they that are below here;'\n--the luminous sphere doubtless is that world yonder where that (sun) is\nburning: he thereby means both the waters which are beyond, and those which\nare below that (sun).\n\n7:1:1:2525\\. [The fourth one, with Va _g_. S. XII, 50] 'The Agnis Purishyas,'\n--that is, the Agnis favourable to cattle; 'together with those of the streams\n(prava _n_ a);' this is a form of starting 1 (praya _n_ a), for the Garhapatya\nis indeed a starting of the fire;--'may they, benevolent, accept the\nsacrifice, the copious, salutary draughts!' that is, 'may they benevolently\naccept the sacrifice, the copious, innocuous draughts!'\n\n7:1:1:2626\\. He puts them down separately: what different desires there are,\nthose he thereby lays into the self. He 'settles' them once: he thereby makes\nthe self one. He pronounces the Sudadohas 2 verse on them; for the Sudadohas\nis the vital air: by means of the vital air he thus makes him (Agni)\ncontinuous, joins him together.\n\n7:1:1:2727\\. Thereupon going round behind, he sits down on the north side with\nhis face to the south, and puts on first the southern one of the two behind,\n\np. 306\n\nwith (Va _g_. S. XII, 51), 'Potent nourishment, O Agni, the possession of\nkine,'--nourishment means cattle: he thus invokes for him the blessing of\ncattle;--'Grant thou perpetually unto him that calleth!'--he that calls\ndoubtless is the Sacrificer; 'May there be to us a son, the perpetuator of the\nrace,'--a son means offspring;--'let that, O Agni, be thy good-will unto us!'\nhe therewith invokes a blessing.\n\n7:1:1:2828\\. Then the northern one, with (Va _g_. S. XII, 52; _Ri_ k S. III,\n29, 10), 'This is thy natural womb, whence born thou shonest forth,'--that is,\n'this (householder's hearth) is thy primeval, perennial womb (birth-place),\nwhence born thou wert enkindled;'--'knowing it, ascend, O Agni, and increase\nour substance!' as the text, so its meaning.\n\n7:1:1:2929\\. These two are his (Agni's) thighs,--separately he puts them on,\nseparately he 'settles' them, separately he pronounces the Sudadohas verse\nupon them, for separate are these two thighs. There are two of them, for there\nare two thighs. Behind he puts them on, for behind are those thighs. At their\nupper ends they are joined (to the central ones 1), for so are these thighs\njoined (to the body) at their upper ends.\n\n7:1:1:3030\\. Thereupon, going round again by the same way, he sits down on the\nsouth side, with his face to the north, and puts on first the northern one of\nthe two (bricks) in front, with (Va _g_. S. XII, 53),\n\np. 307\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Ranging thou art: by that deity, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, lie thou\nsteady 1!' Then the southern one, with, 'Ranging round thou art: by that\ndeity, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, lie thou steady'!'\n\n7:1:1:3131\\. These two are his (Agni's) arms,--separately he puts them on,\nseparately he 'settles' them, separately he pronounces the Sudadohas 2 verse\non them; for separate are these two arms. There are two of them, for there are\ntwo arms. He puts them on in the forepart, for these arms are here in front.\nAt their upper ends they are joined (to the central ones), for so are these\ntwo arms joined (to the body) at the upper ends. Those two (arms) he puts on\nthus (from north to south), and those two (thighs) thus (from south to north):\nthat is (from east to) southward 3, for thus it is with the gods 4.\n\n7:1:1:3232\\. Eight bricks he puts on (the hearth-site),the Gayatri consists of\neight syllables, and Agni is Gayatra 5: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, so great he thus builds him. Five times he 'settles' (the\nbricks)--the fire-altar consists of five layers; five seasons are a year, and\nAgni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,\n\np. 308\n\nso great he thus builds him. Eight bricks he 'settles' five times, that makes\nthirteen,--thirteen months are a year, and there are thirteen layers of earth\nin the fire-altar: as great as Agni is, as great .as is his measure, so great\ndoes this become.\n\n7:1:1:3333\\. He then puts on a space-filling one: the significance of that one\n(will be explained) further on 1. Three there are in front 2,--threefold is\nAgni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds\nhim;--and ten those that follow 3,--the significance of these (will be\nexplained) further on. Or first two, then ten, and then one, for in this way\nthey build up the pile,--these amount to thirteen: the significance of this\nhas been told.\n\n7:1:1:3434\\. Both these kinds (of bricks) amount to twenty-one;--there are\ntwelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the twenty-\nfirst: that sun he thus establishes in this fire-altar.\n\n7:1:1:3535\\. Moreover, there are twenty-one enclosing-stones,--twelve months,\nfive seasons, these three worlds, and that Agni from yonder (sun) 4 as the\ntwenty-first: this Agni he thus establishes in yonder sun. And inasmuch as he\nputs on those (bricks) in this way, he thereby establishes those two (the sun\nand the fire) in each other, and (accordingly) those two are established in\neach other; for both of them he now makes out to be the twenty-first, and both\n\np. 309\n\nof them are then here 1, as the \xc3\x82havaniya and the Garhapatya.\n\n7:1:1:3636\\. He then throws thereon a layer of earth,--the significance of\nthis (will be told) further on 2. He takes it from the edge of the pit ( _K_\natvala); for the _K_ atvala is the same as Agni 3, and in this way does that\nwhich is of Agni's nature become his. It (the Garhapatya altar) should be even\nwith the mouth (of the fire-pan): the significance of this has been told 4.\n\n7:1:1:3737\\. It (the Garhapatya hearth) measures a fathom (in diameter 5), for\nman is a fathom high, and man is Pra _g_ apati (the lord of generation), and\nPra _g_ apati is Agni: he thus makes the womb of equal size to his (Agni's)\nbody. It is circular, for the womb is circular; and moreover the Garhapatya is\nthis (terrestrial) world, and this world doubtless is circular.\n\np. 310\n\n7:1:1:3838\\. He then pours those two (fires) together 1,--he thereby\nestablishes concord between them--with (Va _g_. S. XII, 57-60), 'Unite ye two,\nand get ye on together, loving, radiant, well-disposed, dwelling together for\nfood and drink!--Together have I brought your minds, together your rites,\ntogether your thoughts: O Agni Purishya 2, be thou the overlord, and bestow\nthou food and drink upon our Sacrificer!--O Agni, thou art the Purishya,\nwealthy, prosperous: having made happy all the regions, seat thee here in\nthine own seat!--Be ye two unto us of one mind, of one thought, without guile!\nInjure ye not the sacrifice, nor the lord of the sacrifice, and be ye\npropitious unto us this day, ye knowers of beings!' He therewith pacifies them\nfor (mutual) safety, so that they shall do no injury to one another.\n\n7:1:1:3939\\. With four (verses) he pours them together,--he thereby\nestablishes concord between them by whatever four-footed cattle there are; and\ncattle being food, it is by means of food that he establishes concord between\nthem.\n\n7:1:1:4040\\. Let him not look at that (pan) while empty: 'I must not look at\nthe empty one!' so he thinks. Were he to look at the empty (pan), it would\ncertainly devour him.\n\n7:1:1:4141\\. He then pours sand into it 3, for sand (sikata) is\n\np. 311\n\nthe seed of Agni Vai _s_ vanara: he thus pours (sic) Agni Vai _s_ vanara as\nseed into it. It should be even with the brim: the significance of this has\nbeen explained.\n\n7:1:1:4242\\. He then unlooses it, to keep it from chafing; for if that which\nis yoked is not unloosed it is chafed. Now when yoked there, it (the fire-pan)\nbore this Agni within it as seed, and him it has now brought forth. It now\nconceives a second time; for the 'Ukha' is a female, and hence when a female\nhas brought forth the seed the first time, it conceives a second time.\n\n7:1:1:4343\\. [He unlooses it from the netting, with Va _g_. S. XII, 61] 'Even\nas a mother her son, so hath the Earth borne Agni Purishya,'--that is, Agni,\nfavourable to cattle;--'she, the Ukha, in her own womb;' that is, the Ukha has\nborne Agni in her own womb;--'May Pra _g_ apati, the all-former, release her,\nin concert with the All-gods, the seasons!' the All-gods doubtless are the\nseasons: thus Pra _g_ apati, the all-former, releases it, in concert with the\nAll-gods, the seasons. He deposits it north of the fire, at a cubit's\ndistance: the significance of this has been explained 1.\n\n7:1:1:4444\\. He then pours milk into it,--it first receives seed, and now it\nreceives milk; for the fire-pan is a female: hence when a female receives\nseed, then it receives milk. The sand is below, and the milk above, for the\nseed is below, and the milk above. He pours it into the middle, so that\nthereon he may place the human head 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[298:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_556) That is, 'the householder's fire,' which\nrepresents the Sacrificer's domestic hearth.\n\n[298:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_557) This first pada is taken from _Ri_ k S. X, 14, 9.\nThe four padas of the verse are muttered by the Adhvaryu while sweeping the\nfour sides of the site respectively, beginning in the east and ending in the\nnorth. On this place when swept the circular site of the Garhapatya is then\nmarked off by saline soil being scattered over it (cf. Taitt. S. V, 2, 3,\n2-3).\n\n[299:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_558) For the identification of the Pala _s_ a with the\nBrahman (sacred writ, or the holy spirit embodied therein), see part i, p. 90,\nnote 1.\n\n[299:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_559) 'He throws it upwards,' Delbruck, Synt. F. V, 79.\n\n[300:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_560) Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. S. IV, 2, 4, takes 'sa _m_\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anam' in the sense of 'knowledge, recognition;' explaining it from the\nfact that cattle by their smell recognise the places of saline soil and lick\nthem.\n\n[300:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_561) Or, to keep (the fire) from burning over (or\nthrough the sand, and injuring the saline soil or amnion). For the\nconstruction, see [p. 198](sbe4134.htm#page_198), note\n[2](sbe4134.htm#fn_407).\n\n[300:3](sbe4155.htm#fr_562) This notion is apparently based on the supposed\netymological connection of ' _s_ ikata,' sand, with the root 'si _k_.'\n\n[301:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_563) That is, from east to south, &c., following the\ncourse of the sun.\n\n[301:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_564) ? That is, by digging in each stone, the circle\nconsisting of altogether twenty-one stones.\n\n[301:3](sbe4155.htm#fr_565) The two ceremonies here referred to, viz. the\n'sadana' (settling, setting, steadying, viz. by means of the formula, XII, 53,\n'with the help of that deity lie thou steady, like A\xe1\xb9\x85giras,' see [VII, 1, 1,\n30](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:30)) and the muttering of the Sudadohas verse (Va _g_.\nS. XII, 55, for which p. 302 see note *2* to [paragraph\n31](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:31)), are the so-called 'necessary' rites, because they\nhave as a rule to be performed on each (special) brick, when it has been laid\ndown in building up the fire-altar.\n\n[302:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_566) Viz. the so-called 'lokamp _ri_ _n_ a' (or space-\nfilling bricks), for which see [p. 153](sbe4129.htm#page_153), note\n*[1](sbe4129.htm#fn_306)*.\n\n[303:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_567) That is, with the lines by which they are marked\nrunning from west to east. Whilst these four bricks are oblong ones, measuring\ntwo feet by one, the four placed at the back and in front of them measure each\na foot square, as do also those placed in the corners of the square pile,\nexcept the south-east corner, where two bricks are to be placed measuring one\nfoot by half a foot each.\n\n[303:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_568) See [VI, 1, 1,\n3](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:3)-[6](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:6).\n\n[303:3](sbe4155.htm#fr_569) Or 'yonder,' that is, as the great fire-altar,\nsoon to be built, which is ultimately to receive the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, taken\nfrom the Garhapatya.\n\n[303:4](sbe4155.htm#fr_570) While in the form of the Garhapatya the wings and\ntail are not represented at all, these appendages form an important part of\nthe great altar of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire. In the Garhapatya hearth, Agni would\nseem represented rather as a man lying on his back with the head towards the\neast.\n\n[304:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_571) In laying down the bricks he again follows the\ncourse of the sun, that is, he lays down the four large or central ones from\nnorth to south, then the two back ones from south to north, and finally the\ntwo front ones from north to south.\n\n[304:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_572) ? That is, Thou, being built (as the Garhapatya),\nart built (once more as the \xc3\x82havaniya).\n\n[305:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_573) Viz. inasmuch as 'prava _n_ a' begins with the\npreposition 'pra,' forward, Say.\n\n[305:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_574) See p. 307, note 2.\n\n[306:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_575) They are joined to each other, according to Saya\n_n_ a, but this can hardly be the meaning intended, as the stones lie close to\neach other also at the lower (western) end.\n\n[307:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_576) This common portion of the two formulas forms the\nso-called 'settling' (or 'setting') formula (sadana); Katy. Sr. XVI, 7, 14;\ncf. [VI, 1, 2, 28](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:28), and p. 301, note 3. A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like'\napparently means, 'as (thou didst) in the case of, or with, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras.'\n\n[307:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_577) Va _g_. S. XII, 55; _Ri_ k S. VIII, 69, 3. 'At his\nbirth the well-like milking, speckled ones mix the Soma (draught), the clans\nof the gods in the three spheres of the heavens.' This difficult verse has\nbeen differently translated by different translators. The Brahma _n_ a itself\nalso gives a very different, doubtless quite fanciful, interpretation of it at\nVIII, 7, 3, 21.\n\n[307:3](sbe4155.htm#fr_578) That is, in accordance with the course of the sun.\n\n[307:4](sbe4155.htm#fr_579) Or, 'thus (it goes,--or, Agni, as a bird, flies)\nto the gods.'\n\n[307:5](sbe4155.htm#fr_580) See [VI, 1, 1, 15](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:15).\n\n[308:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_581) VIII, 7, 2, 1 seq.\n\n[308:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_582) Viz. one in the north-east, and two (of half the\nsize) in the south-east corner.\n\n[308:3](sbe4155.htm#fr_583) Viz. one in the south-west, and one in the north-\nwest corner; and further, eight more filling up the four segments of the\ncircle. See the outline of the Garhapatya altar at p. 302.\n\n[308:4](sbe4155.htm#fr_584) Or, perhaps that Agni on yonder sky (or fire-\naltar?). In any case it is the sun that is referred to.\n\n[309:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_585) That is to say, they will be here after the\ncompletion of the two altars,--the Garhapatya fire being the Agni proper, and\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya fire the sun.\n\n[309:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_586) For this, and the formula (Va _g_. S. XII, 56)\nused therewith, see VIII, 7, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[309:3](sbe4155.htm#fr_587) See part ii, p. 116, note 3, 'The earth taken from\nthe pit being used for constructing the high altar, both are of the same size\nor cubic extent.'\n\n[309:4](sbe4155.htm#fr_588) See [VI, 3, 3, 26](sbe4136.htm#6:3:3:26).\n\n[309:5](sbe4155.htm#fr_589) Or rather, it is a circle corresponding in area to\na square of one fathom; which gives a diameter somewhat exceeding in length a\nfathom (that is, the space between the tips of the middle fingers when the\narms are extended). The measurement is (at least theoretically) a relative\none, being adapted to the Sacrificer's size; but practically the fathom\n(vyama, or purusha, man) may be taken to be of about 6 feet, the vyama being\nequal to 4 aratnis (cubits) of 2 prade _s_ as (spans of some 18 inches each).\nThis allows for a central square of 4 feet, and about 1 foot (in reality\nsomewhat less) for each of the two bisectors of the segments.\n\n[310:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_590) That is, he pours the fire of the pan (ukhyagni)\non the Garhapatya (hearth).\n\n[310:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_591) 'Purishya' seems here to have the sense of 'rich,\nplentiful.' See [p. 201](sbe4134.htm#page_201), note\n*[1](sbe4134.htm#fn_415)*.\n\n[310:3](sbe4155.htm#fr_592) 'Ukha,' the pan, is feminine, and represents the\nwomb from which Agni is born.\n\n[311:1](sbe4155.htm#fr_593) [VI, 3, 1, 30](sbe4134.htm#6:3:1:30).\n\n[311:2](sbe4155.htm#fr_594) See [VII, 5, 2, 14](sbe4166.htm#7:5:2:14).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 1, 2.
