Now, the A _m_ _s_ u (cup of Soma) 1, indeed, is no other than Pra\n_g_ apati; and it is the body of this (sacrifice), for Pra _g_ apati, indeed,\nis the body. And the Adabhya 2 (cup of Soma) is no other than speech. When he\ndraws the A _m_ _s_ u-cup, and then the Adabhya-cup, he thereby constructs the\nbody of this (sacrifice) and then establishes that speech therein.\n\n11:5:9:22\\. And, indeed, the A _m_ _s_ u is also the mind, and the Adabhya\nspeech; and the A _m_ _s_ u is the out-breathing, and the Adabhya the up-\nbreathing; and the A _m_ _s_ u is the eye, and the Adabhya the ear: these two\ncups they draw for the sake of wholeness and completeness.\n\n11:5:9:33\\. Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_\napati, were contending,--it was for this very sacrifice, for Pra _g_ apati,\nthat they were contending, saying, 'Ours he shall be! ours he shall be!'\n\n11:5:9:44\\. The gods then went on singing praises, and toiling. They saw this\ncup of Soma, this Adabhya, and drew it: they seized upon the (three) Soma-\nservices, and possessed themselves of the whole sacrifice, and excluded the\nAsuras from the sacrifice.\n\n11:5:9:55\\. They spake, 'Surely, we have destroyed (adabhama) them;' whence\n(the cup is called) Adabhya;--'they have not destroyed (dabh) us;' whence also\n(it is called) Adabhya. And the Adabhya\n\np. 106\n\nbeing speech, this speech is indestructible, whence also it is (called)\nAdabhya; and, verily, in like manner does he who knows this possess himself of\nthe whole sacrifice of his spiteful enemy, and exclude and shut out his\nspiteful enemy from all participation in the sacrifice.\n\n11:5:9:66\\. Into the same vessel with which he draws the A _m_ _s_ u 1 he\npours water from the Nigrabhya _h_  2, and therein puts those Soma-plants 3\nwith (Va _g_. S. VIII, 47),--\n\n11:5:9:77\\. 'Thou art taken with a support 4: for Agni I take thee, possessed\nof the Gayatri metre!'--the morning-service is of Gayatri nature: he thus\npossesses himself of the morning-service;--'For Indra I take thee, possessed\nof the Trish _t_ ubh metre!'--the midday-service is of Trish _t_ ubh nature:\nhe thus possesses himself of the midday-service;--'For the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_\nI take thee, possessed of the _G_ agati metre!'--the evening-service is of _G_\nagati nature: he thus possesses himself of the evening-service;--'The Anush\n_t_ ubh is thy song of praise;'--whatever is subsequent to the (three)\nservices 5, that is of Anush _t_ ubh nature: it is thereof he thus possesses\n\np. 107\n\nhimself. He does not press this (batch of Soma-plants) lest he should injure\nspeech (or, the voice of the sacrifice), for the press-stone is a thunderbolt,\nand the Adabhya is speech.\n\n11:5:9:88\\. He merely shakes the (cup with the) plants with (Va _g_. S. VIII,\n48), 'In the flow of the streaming (waters) I waft thee! in the flow of the\ngurgling I waft thee! in the flow of the jubilant I waft thee! in the flow of\nthe most delightsome I waft thee! in the flow of the most sweet I waft thee!'\nThese doubtless are the divine waters: he thus bestows sap on him (Pra _g_\napati, the sacrifice) by means of both the divine and the human waters which\nthere are.\n\n11:5:9:99\\. 'Thee, the bright, I waft in the bright,'--for he indeed wafts the\nbright one in the bright;--'in the form of the day, in the rays of the sun;'--\nhe thus wafts it both in the form of the day and in the rays of the sun.\n\n11:5:9:1010\\. [Va _g_. S. VIII, 41], 'Mightily shineth the towering form of\nthe ball,'--for mightily indeed shines that towering form of the ball, to wit,\nyonder burning (sun);--'the bright one, the leader of the bright one, Soma,\nthe leader of Soma,'--he thereby makes that bright (sun) the leader of the\nbright (Soma), and Soma the leader of the Soma;--'what indestructible,\nwatchful name there is of thine, for that do I take thee;'--for this, to wit,\nspeech, is indeed his (Soma's) indestructible (adabhya), watchful name: it is\nthus speech he thereby takes for speech.\n\n11:5:9:1111\\. Then, stepping out (from the Havirdhana shed 1) to (the\n\xc3\x82havaniya), he offers with, 'O\n\np. 108\n\n[paragraph continues] Soma, to this thy Soma, hail!'--he thus offers Soma to\nSoma, and so does not throw speech into the fire 1. He breathes over gold 2:\nthe meaning of this is the same as there (on the occasion of the A _m_ _s_ u).\nHe gives as many presents (to the priests) as for the A _m_ _s_ u-graha.\n\n11:5:9:1212\\. He then puts the Soma-plants back (on the heap of plants in the\nHavirdhana) with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 50), 'Enter thou gladly Agni's dear seat, O\ndivine Soma!--Enter thou willingly Indra's dear seat, O divine Soma!--As our\nfriend enter thou, O divine Soma, the dear seat of the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_!' On\nthat former occasion he possessed himself of the (three) Soma services; he now\nrestores them again, and causes them to be no longer used up; and with them\nthus restored they perform the sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[105:1](sbe44033.htm#fr_337) See IV, 1, 1, 2; 6, 1, 1.\n\n[105:2](sbe44033.htm#fr_338) See part ii, p. 424, note 1.\n\n[106:1](sbe44033.htm#fr_339) See IV, 6, 1, 3 seq.\n\n[106:2](sbe44033.htm#fr_340) That is, the water originally taken from the Pra\n_n_ ita water, and poured into the (square) Hot _ri_ 's cup (made of Udumbara\nwood), to be used for moistening the Soma-plants.\n\n[106:3](sbe44033.htm#fr_341) For the Adabhya he puts three Soma-plants into\nthe Hot _ri_ 's cup.\n\n[106:4](sbe44033.htm#fr_342) According to Katy. XII, 6, 15, this portion of\nthe formula--the 'upayama,' or support--is repeated before the formulas of\neach of the three plants, hence also before 'For Indra . . .,' and 'For the Vi\n_s_ ve Deva _h_ . . .'\n\n[106:5](sbe44033.htm#fr_343) Viz. the Ukthyas, Sho _d_ a _s_ in, &c., in forms\nof Soma-sacrifice other than the Agnish _t_ oma.\n\n[107:1](sbe44033.htm#fr_344) It is there that the Soma-plants are kept.\n\n[108:1](sbe44033.htm#fr_345) Though the Adabhya-graha, that is, the water in\nwhich the three Soma-plants are contained, and which alone is offered, has\nbeen identified with speech, the wording of the formula is such as to protect\n(the faculty of) speech from being burned in the fire.\n\n[108:2](sbe44033.htm#fr_346) Just as, after the offering of the A _m_ _s_\nu-graha, he smelled at (or breathed over) a piece of gold fastened to (? or\ncontained in) the spoon, see IV, 6, 1, 6 seqq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 6, 1.
