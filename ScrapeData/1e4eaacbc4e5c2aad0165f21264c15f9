When he has finished the Veda, he should take the bath (by which he\nbecomes a Snataka);\n\n2 2. Or when (he has gone through) a studentship of forty-eight years;\n\n3 3. Or also after (a studentship) of twelve years, according to some\n(teachers).\n\n4\\. (Let him take the bath only) if his Guru has given his permission.\n\n5 5. Rules (regarding the performance of sacrifices), (texts) to be used (at\nthe sacrifices according to those rules), and reasoning (on the meaning of the\nrites and texts): that is the Veda.\n\n6 6. Some say (that the Veda should be studied) with its six A\xe1\xb9\x85gas;\n\np. 313\n\n7\\. Not so that he only knows the ceremonial.\n\n8\\. But optionally by one who knows the sacrifices (the bath may be taken).\n\n9\\. (The student) after having embraced (the feet of) his teacher, and put the\npieces of wood on the fire, places himself northwards of an enclosure, on\neastward-pointed Ku _s_ a grass, to the east of eight vessels with water.\n\n10 10. 'The fires that dwell in the waters; the fire which must be hidden, the\nfire which must be covered, the ray of light, the fire which kills the mind,\nthe unwavering one, the pain-causing one, the destroyer of the body, the fire\nwhich kills the organs\xc2\x97those I leave behind. The shining one, that I seize\nhere'\xc2\x97with (this formula) he draws water out of one (of the eight vessels);\n\n11\\. With that he besprinkles himself with (the words), 'Therewith I\nbesprinkle myself for the sake of prosperity, of glory, of holiness, of holy\nlustre.'\n\n12 12. (A second time he draws water out of a second of the eight vessels with\nthe formula given in Sutra 10, putting instead of the words, 'The shining one,\n&c.,' the verse): 'By which you have created prosperity, by which you have\ntouched sura, with which you have anointed the eyes, which is your' glory, O A\n_s_ vins.'\n\np. 314\n\n13\\. (And he draws water out of three other vessels) with (the three verses),\n'Ye waters are' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XI, 50-52), verse by verse.\n\n14\\. With (water drawn out of) the three other (vessels he besprinkles\nhimself) silently.\n\n15\\. Having loosened his girdle with (the verse), 'The highest band' (Va _g_.\nSa _m_ h. XII, 12), having put it down, having put on another garment, he\nworships the sun\xc2\x97\n\n16 16. With (the formulas), 'Rising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands\nwith the Maruts; he stands with the gods who walk in the morning. Thou art a\ntenfold winner; make me a tenfold winner. Make me attain to renown.\n\nRising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands with the Maruts; he stands with\nthe gods who walk in day-time. Thou art a hundredfold winner; make me a\nhundredfold winner. Make me attain to renown.\n\nRising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands with the Maruts; he stands with\nthe gods who walk in the evening. Thou art a thousandfold winner; make me a\nthousandfold winner. Make me attain to renown.'\n\n17\\. Having eaten curds or sesamum seeds, and having had his matted hair, the\nhair of his body, and his nails cut, he should cleanse his teeth with an\nUdumbara branch with (the verse), 'Array yourselves for the enjoyment of food.\nHere has come king Soma: he will purify my mouth with glory and fortune.'\n\np. 315\n\n18\\. Having anointed himself and bathed again, he takes up the salve for nose\nand mouth with (the words), 'Satiate my up-breathing and down-breathing;\nsatiate my eye; satiate my ear!'\n\n19\\. Having poured out to the south the water with which he has washed his\nhands, with (the words), 'Ye fathers, become pure,' he should salve himself\nand murmur, 'May I become well-looking with my eyes, well-shining with my\nface, well-hearing with my ears.'\n\n20 20. He then should put on a garment which has not yet been washed, or not\nbeen soaked in lie, with (the formula), 'For the sake of putting on, of\nbringing fame, of long life I shall reach old age. I live a hundred long\nautumns. For the sake of the increase of wealth I will clothe myself.'\n\n21\\. Then the upper garment with (the verse), 'With glory (come) to me, Heaven\nand Earth. With glory, Indra and B _ri_ haspati! May glory and fortune come to\nme! may glory be my lot!'\n\n22 22. If (he has only) one (garment), he should cover himself (with a part of\nthat garment as if it were an upper garment) with the second part of the\nformer (Mantra; Sutra 20).\n\n23 23. He takes flowers with (the formula), '(The\n\np. 316\n\nflowers) which _G_ amadagni has brought for the sake of faith (has brought to\n_S_ raddha?), of love, of the senses, them I take with glory and with\nfortune.'\n\n24\\. He then ties them (to his head) with (the verse), 'The high, wide glory,\nwhich Indra has created for the Apsarases, the flowers bound up with that, I\ntie on to me, to bring me glory!'\n\n25 25. He binds a turban to his head with (the verse), 'A youth, well\nattired.'\n\n26\\. (He puts on) the two ear-rings with (the words), 'An ornament art thou;\nmay more ornaments be mine.'\n\n27\\. He salves his two eyes with (the formula), 'V _ri_ tra\xc2\x92s' (Va _g_. Sa _m_\nh. IV, 3 b).\n\n28\\. With (the words), 'Brilliant art thou,' he looks at his image in a\nmirror.\n\n29\\. He takes a parasol with (the words), 'Thou art B _ri_ haspati's covering.\nShelter me from evil. Do not shelter me from splendour and glory.'\n\n30\\. With (the words), 'You are supports; protect me from all sides,' he puts\non the two shoes.\n\n31\\. With (the words), 'From all powers of destruction protect me on all\nsides,' he takes a bamboo staff.\n\n32\\. (For) the tooth-cleaner, &c. (the Mantras stated above are to be used) in\nevery case; (for) the garment, the parasol, and the shoes, the Mantra (should\nonly be recited) if they have not been used before.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[312:2](sbe29179.htm#fr_791) 6, 2. See above, chap. 5, 13.\n\n[312:3](sbe29179.htm#fr_792) See chap. 5, 14.\n\n[312:5](sbe29179.htm#fr_793) The expressions of the text for the three\ncategories are, vidhi, vidheya, tarka.\n\n[312:6](sbe29179.htm#fr_794) I.e. with the supplementary treatises on ritual,\ngrammar, astronomy, etymology, pronunciation of the Mantras, and metrics.\n\n[313:10](sbe29179.htm#fr_795) As to the names of the eight hostile powers of\nAgni, comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya V, 2; Atharva-veda XIV, I, 38; XVI, 1;\nMantrabrahma _n_ a I, 7, I.\n\n[313:12](sbe29179.htm#fr_796) The reading of the Mantra seems to be corrupt.\nCompare the form in which it is given by Bhavadeva, quoted in Professor\nStenzler's note on this Sutra. Instead of _s_ riyam we have probably to read,\nas Bhavadeva has, striyam; instead of akshyau, akshan. Professor Stenzler very\npertinently compares Atharva-veda XIV, 1, 35. 36. Comp. also Mantrabrahma _n_\na I, 7, 5.\n\n[314:16](sbe29179.htm#fr_797) In the Mantra the Paraskara MSS. give bhra _g_\nabh _ri_ sh _n_ u _h_ and bhra _g_ abh _ri_ sh _t_ i _h_ , and the Gobhila\nMSS. (G _ri_ hya III, 4) bhra _g_ abh _ri_ sh _t_ ibhi _h_. Possibly the\ninstrumental case is right. Bohtlingk and Roth propose to read bhra _g_ ad\n_ri_ sh _t_ i _h_.\n\n[315:20](sbe29179.htm#fr_798) Comp. Katyayana, _S_ rauta-sutra VII, 2, 18, to\nwhich Sutra Professor Stenzler refers.\n\n[315:22](sbe29179.htm#fr_799) I give this translation merely as tentative.\nProfessor Stenzler translates: Wenn er nur Ein Gewand hat, so bedecke er sich\n(noch einmal) mit dem oberen Theile des zuerst angelegten. _G_ ayarama (MS.\nChambers 373) says: eka _m_ _k_ et tatrapi paridhanamantra _m_ pa _th_ itva\nvastrardham paridhaya dvir a _k_ amya uttarardhe g _ri_ hitva uttariya _m_\n[sic] mantra _m_ pa _th_ itvottariya _m_ k _ri_ tva punar dvir a _k_ amed ity\nartha _h_.\n\n[315:23](sbe29179.htm#fr_800) Hira _n_ y.-G _ri_ hya I, 3, 11, 4.\n\n[316:25](sbe29179.htm#fr_801) See above, chap. 2, 9.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 7](sbe29180.htm)\n\n"
