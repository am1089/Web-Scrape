He had three\nmouths; and because he was thus shaped, his name was Vi _s_ varupa (\'All-\nshape\').\n\n1:6:3:22\\. One of his mouths was Soma-drinking, one spirit-drinking, and one\nfor other kinds of food. Indra hated him and cut off those heads of his.\n\n1:6:3:33\\. Now from the one which was Soma-drinking, a hazel-cock (francoline\npartridge) sprang forth; whence the latter is of brownish colour, for king\nSoma is brown.\n\n1:6:3:44\\. From the one which was spirit-drinking, further, a sparrow sprang;\nwhence the latter talks as if stammering, for he who has drunk spirits, talks\nas if he stammered.\n\n1:6:3:55\\. Then from the one which served for other kinds of food, a partridge\nsprang; whence the latter\n\np. 165\n\nis much variegated in colour: on its wings, namely, butter-drops, as it were,\nhave dropped in one place and honey- (or mead-) drops in another, for\nsuchlike, as it were, was the food which he consumed with that (mouth).\n\n1:6:3:66\\. Tvash _t_ _ri_ was furious: \'Has he indeed slain my son?\' he\nexclaimed. He brought Soma-juice from which Indra was excluded; and just as\nthe Soma-juice on being produced had Indra excluded from it (apendra), so it\nremained (when it was offered up).\n\n1:6:3:77\\. Indra thought with himself, \'They are now excluding me from Soma!\'\nand though uninvited, he consumed what pure (Soma) there was in the tub, even\nas the stronger (consumes) that of a weaker. That (Soma) however, injured him;\nit flowed in all directions from (the openings of) his vital airs; from his\nmouth alone it did not flow, but from all the other (openings of the) vital\nairs it flowed; hence (was instituted) at that time the ish _t_ i, called\nSautrama _n_ i: on the occasion of that (ceremony) it is explained how the\ngods healed him 1.\n\n1:6:3:88\\. Tvash _t_ _ri_ was furious, and exclaimed, \'Has he indeed consumed\nmy Soma uninvited?\' However, he himself desecrated the sacrifice, for what\npure (Soma) there was left in the tub he let flow (into the fire), saying,\n\'Grow thou, having Indra for thy foe 2!\' The moment it reached the fire, it\n\np. 166\n\ndeveloped (into human shape), or, as some say, it so developed whilst on its\nway (to the fire). It became possessed of 1 Agni and Soma, of all sciences,\nall glory, all nourishment, all prosperity.\n\n1:6:3:99\\. And since it so developed whilst rolling onwards (v _ri_ t), it\nbecame V _ri_ tra; and since he sprang forth footless, therefore he was a\nserpent. Danu and Danayu received him like mother and father 2, whence they\ncall him Danava.\n\n1:6:3:1010\\. And because he (Tvash _t_ _ri_ ) said, \'Grow thou, having Indra\nfor thy foe!\' therefore Indra slew him (V _ri_ tra). Had he said, \'Grow thou,\nthe foe (slayer) of Indra!\' he (V _ri_ tra) would certainly have forthwith\nslain Indra.\n\n1:6:3:1111\\. And because he (Tvash _t_ _ri_ ) said, \'Grow thou!\' therefore he\n(V _ri_ tra) grew an arrow\'s range sideways and an arrow\'s range forward: he\nforced back both the western ocean and the eastern one; and in proportion as\nhe extended did he devour the food.\n\n1:6:3:1212\\. In the fore-noon the gods offered him food, at mid-day the men,\nand in the after-noon the Fathers.\n\n1:6:3:1313\\. Now while Indra was thus moving on (in pursuit of V _ri_ tra), he\naddressed Agni and Soma, \'Ye belong to me and I belong to you! That one is\nnothing to you: why then do ye support that Dasyu against me? Come over to\nme!\'\n\np. 167\n\n1:6:3:1414\\. They replied, \'What is to be our reward in that case?\' He offered\nthem that Agni-Soma cake on eleven potsherds: this is the reason why there is\na cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma.\n\n1:6:3:1515\\. They went over to him, and after them went forth 1 all the gods,\nall the sciences, all glory, all nourishment, all prosperity: thus by offering\nthat (cake to Agni and Soma) Indra became what Indra now is. Such then is the\nsignificance of the full-moon offering; and he who, knowing this, performs the\nfull-moon offering in this wise, attains to the same state of prosperity,\nbecomes thus endowed with glory, becomes such a consumer of food (as V _ri_\ntra).\n\n1:6:3:1616\\. Now V _ri_ tra, on being struck, lay contracted like a leather\nbottle drained of its contents, like a skin bag with the barley-meal shaken\nout. Indra rushed at him, meaning to slay him.\n\n1:6:3:1717\\. He said, \'Do not hurl (thy thunderbolt) at me! thou art now what\nI (was before) Only cut me in twain; but do not let me be annihilated!\' He\n(Indra) said, \'Thou shalt be my food!\' He replied, \'So be it!\' He accordingly\ncut him in twain; and from that (part) of his which was of the Soma nature 2,\nhe made the moon, and that which was demoniacal (asurya) he made enter these\ncreatures as their belly; hence people say 3: \'V _ri_ tra was then a consumer\nof food, and V _ri_ tra is so now.\' For even now, whenever that one (the moon)\nwaxes fuller, it fills itself out of this world 4; and whenever\n\np. 168\n\nthese creatures crave for food, they pay tribute to this V _ri_ tra, the\nbelly. Whosoever knows that V _ri_ tra as a consumer of food, becomes himself\na consumer of food.\n\n1:6:3:1818\\. Those deities then said, \'Ye, Agni and Soma, whom we have\nfollowed hither, take the best part (of the sacrificial food): do let us share\nalong with you in what ye have!\'\n\n1:6:3:1919\\. They both said, \'What (share) shall then be ours?\' They replied,\n\'For whatever deity they shall take out sacrificial food, they shall in the\nfirst place offer to you some clarified butter!\' Whenever, therefore, they\ntake out sacrificial food for any deity, they in the first place offer two\nbutter-portions to Agni and Soma. This does not take place at the Soma-\nsacrifice, nor at the animal offering; for they said, \'for whatever deity they\ntake out . . .  1.\'\n\n1:6:3:2020\\. Agni then said, \'In me they shall sacrifice for all of you, and\nthus I give you a share in me!\' For this reason they sacrifice in Agni (the\nfire) to all the gods; and for this reason they say that Agni is all the\ndeities.\n\n1:6:3:2121\\. Soma then said, \'Me they shall offer up to all of you, and thus I\ngive you a share in me!\' For this reason they offer up Soma to all the gods;\nand hence they say that Soma is all the deities.\n\n1:6:3:2222\\. And further, since all the gods were abiding in Indra, for that\nreason they say that Indra is all the deities, that the gods have Indra for\ntheir chief ( _s_ resh _th_ a). Thus the gods came in a three-fold\n\np. 169\n\nway to consist of one deity; and he who knows this becomes individually the\nchief of his own (people).\n\n1:6:3:2323\\. Twofold, verily, is this, there is no third: to wit, the moist\nand the dry; and what is dry, that relates to Agni; and what is moist, that\nrelates to Soma. But (it may be objected) if this is twofold only, why then\nthis manifold performance:--the two butter-portions for Agni and Soma, the\nlow-voiced offering to Agni and Soma, and the rice-cake for Agni and Soma,--\nwhen by means of any one of these he obtains all, why then this manifold\nperformance? [The answer to this objection is that] so manifold is the power,\nthe generative force of Agni and Soma.\n\n1:6:3:2424\\. The sun, indeed, relates to Agni, and the moon to Soma; the day\nrelates to Agni, and the night to Soma; the waxing half-moon relates to Agni,\nand the waning one to Soma.\n\n1:6:3:2525\\. \'By means of the two butter-portions he obtains the sun and the\nmoon; by means of the low-voiced offering he obtains the day and the night;\nand by means of the rice-cake he obtains the two half-moons,\' thus say some.\n\n1:6:3:2626\\. \xc3\x82suri, on the other hand, said: \'By means of the two butter-\nportions he gains any two (of those objects 1); by means of the low-voiced\noffering he obtains any (other) two; and by means of the rice-cake he obtains\nany (other) two: "all has been obtained, all has been conquered by me! with\nthat All I will slay V _ri_ tra; with the All I will slay the\n\np. 170\n\nspiteful enemy!" thus he thinks, and for that reason there is this manifold\nperformance.\'\n\n1:6:3:2727\\. On this point it has also been remarked: \'Why this sameness (of\nperformance)? By what is introduced between the butter(-offering) to Agni and\nSoma and the rice-cake to Agni and Soma, a repetition of performance (is\ncommitted) 1.\' Sameness (of performance), nevertheless, is avoided in this\nway: the one (viz. the low-voiced offering) consists of butter, and the other\nof a rice-cake, hence the one is different from the other. Moreover, after\nreciting a _Ri_ k-verse as anuvakya, he pronounces the ya _g_ ya with the word\n\'pleased\' (in the case of the butter-portions to Agni and Soma); and after\nreciting a _Ri_ k-verse as anuvakya, he pronounces the ya _g_ ya in the form\nof a _Ri_ k-verse (in the case of the low-voiced offering to Agni and Soma),\nhence the one is (again) different from the other 2. Sameness of performance\nis also avoided in this way: in a low voice (he utters the formulas when) he\noffers of the butter, and with a loud voice of the cake; and what is (uttered)\nin a low voice, that is the manner of Pra _g_ apati: hence he recites for that\n(low-voiced\n\np. 171\n\noffering) an anush _t_ ubh-verse as the invitatory formula (anuvakya), for the\nanush _t_ ubh represents speech, and Pra _g_ apati also is speech.\n\n1:6:3:2828\\. By means of that low-voiced offering the gods stealing near slew,\nwith that thunderbolt, the vasha _t_ -call, whichever they wished of the\nAsuras; and so does this one, after stealing near by means of that low-voiced\noffering, slay with that thunderbolt, the vasha _t_ -call, the wicked,\nspiteful enemy 1. This is why he performs the low-voiced offering.\n\n1:6:3:2929\\. Having recited (at the butter-portions) a _Ri_ k-verse as the\nanuvakya, he recites the ya _g_ ya with the word \'pleased:\' in consequence of\nthis, creatures are brought forth here with teeth on one side (in one jaw);\nfor the _Ri_ k means bone and the tooth also is bone, so that he thereby\nproduces bone on one side.\n\n1:6:3:3030\\. Having recited (at the low-voiced offering) a _Ri_ k-verse as the\nanuvakya, he recites as the ya _g_ ya a (second) _Ri_ k-verse: in consequence\nof this, creatures with teeth on both sides are brought forth here; for the\n_Ri_ k means bone and the tooth also is bone, so that he thereby produces bone\non both sides. These creatures, indeed, are of two kinds, viz. such as have\nteeth on one side only, and such as have teeth on both sides 2; and verily he\nwho sacrifices, knowing\n\np. 172\n\nthus the generative power of Agni and Soma, becomes rich in offspring and\ncattle.\n\n1:6:3:3131\\. When he (the sacrificer) is about to enter upon the fast of the\nfull-moon ceremony, he may not be entirely sated. He therefore now compresses\n(that part of) his belly which relates to the Asuras; and next morning, by\nmeans of the oblations, that which relates to the gods. Now the practice\nregarding the full-moon ceremony is as follows:\n\n1:6:3:3232\\. One may (enter on the) fast at the very time (of full moon),\nthinking, \'Now I will slay V _ri_ tra, now I will slay the spiteful enemy!\'\n\n1:6:3:3333\\. One may also fast only on the following day. Now he who (enters\non the) fast at the very time (of full moon), gets, as it were, into collision\n1 (with some one); and when two come into collision with one another, it is\nindeed doubtful which of the two will get the better of the other. He, on the\nother hand, who prefers to fast on the second day (only), is as one who\ncrushes from behind a retreating (enemy) before he is able to resist the\nattack: striking in one direction 2, in fact, is he who thus keeps the fast on\nthe second day only.\n\n1:6:3:3434\\. Let him therefore enter on the fast at the very time (of full\nmoon). He who keeps the fast on the following day only is as one who finally\ncrushes one struck down by some one else; he only does what has been done\nbefore by some one else, he only\n\np. 173\n\nfollows another\'s lead; let him therefore enter on the fast at the very time\n(of full moon).\n\n1:6:3:3535\\. After Pra _g_ apati had created the living beings, his joints\n(parvan) were relaxed. Now Pra _g_ apati, doubtless, is the year, and his\njoints are the two junctions of day and night (i.e. the, twilights), the full\nmoon and new moon, and the beginnings of the seasons.\n\n1:6:3:3636\\. He was unable to rise with his relaxed joints; and the gods\nhealed him by means of these havis-offerings: by means of the Agnihotra they\nhealed that joint (which consists of) the two junctions of day and night,\njoined that together; by means of the full-moon and the new-moon sacrifice\nthey healed that joint (which consists of) the full and new moon, joined that\ntogether; and by means of the (three) _K_ aturmasyas (seasonal offerings) they\nhealed that joint (which consists of) the beginnings of the seasons, joined\nthat together.\n\n1:6:3:3737\\. With his joints thus repaired he betook himself to this food,--to\nthe food which is here (offered) to Pra _g_ apati; and he who, knowing this,\nenters upon the fast at the very time (of full moon), heals Pra _g_ apati\'s\njoint at the proper time, and Pra _g_ apati favours him. Thus he who, knowing\nthis, enters upon the fast at the very time (of full moon) becomes a consumer\nof food: let him therefore enter on the fast at the very time (of full moon).\n\n1:6:3:3838\\. These two butter-portions (to Agni and Soma), truly, are the eyes\nof the sacrifice; he, therefore, offers them in front (of, or before, the\nhavis), for these eyes are in the front (of the head). Hence he thereby places\nthe eyes in the front; and for this reason these eyes are in the front (of the\nhead).\n\np. 174\n\n1:6:3:3939\\. Some people offer Agni\'s butter-portion in the north-eastern part\n(of the fire), and Soma\'s butter-portion in the south-eastern part, thinking,\n\'Thereby we place the eyes in the front (of the head).\' This, however, is\nrather unintelligible; for the several dishes of sacrificial food (havis)\nrepresent the body of the sacrifice; when therefore he offers in front of (or\nbefore) the havis, he thereby places the eyes in the front. Let him rather\nmake the offerings (in that part of the fire) where he thinks the fiercest\nblaze is; for only by being offered in blazing (fire) are oblations successful\n1.\n\n1:6:3:4040\\. Having recited (at the butter-portions) a _Ri_ k-verse as\nanuvakya (invitatory formula), he recites by way of ya _g_ ya (offering-\nprayer) the (formula containing the word) \'pleased;\' thereby these boneless\neyes are set in what is bone. If, on the other hand, after reciting a _Ri_\nk-verse as anuvakya, he\n\np. 175\n\nwere to use a _Ri_ k-verse as the ya _g_ ya, he would make it bone instead of\neye.\n\n1:6:3:4141\\. Those two (qualities), truly, are related to the natures of Agni\nand Soma: that which is white is related to Agni, and that which is black is\nrelated to Soma. If, however (it were asserted), on the contrary, that what is\nblack is related to Agni, and what is white is related to Soma,--[the answer\nwould be:--] what sees is of the nature of Agni, for dry, as it were, are the\neyes of one who looks, and that which is dry relates to Agni;--and what sleeps\nis of the nature of Soma, for moist, as it were, are the eyes of one who is\nasleep, and moist also is Soma. And, verily, he who thus knows those two\nbutter-portions to be eyes, remains endowed with eye-sight till old age in\nthis world, and starts in yonder world possessed of eye-sight.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[164:1](sbe1227.htm#fr_383) See I, 3, 5, 10.\n\n[164:2](sbe1227.htm#fr_384) For these verses, the first of which begins \'Agni\nis the head of the sky,\' see Va _g_. S. XIII, 14 and 15.\n\n[164:3](sbe1227.htm#fr_385) That is, the ya _g_ ya (offering-prayer) and\npuro\'nuvakya (invitatory prayer) at the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, or oblation to\nAgni, as the maker of good offering, at the end of the chief oblations. The\ntwo vira _g_ formulas are Rig-veda VII, 1, 3 (Va _g_. XVII, 76; Taitt. S. IV\n5, 4) preddho agne didihi, and Rig-veda VII, 1, 18 (Taitt. S. IV, 3, 13, 6)\nimo agne. Cf. Ait. Br. I, 5.\n\n[165:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_386) See V, 5, 4, 2 seq., where the whole legend is\nrepeated; and Taitt. S. II, 4, 12, 1. One of the objects of the Sautrama _n_ i\nis the expiation of an immoderate consumption of Soma by a priest.\n\n[165:2](sbe1228.htm#fr_387) According to Taitt. S. II, 4, 12, 1, also the\nfault committed by Tvash _t_ _ri_ consisted in his faulty accentuation of the\ncompound indra _s_ atru in the formula. What he intended to say was that Agni,\non drinking the Soma, should grow strong so as to be \'the foe (slayer) of\nIndra,\' and the compound should therefore have been accented on the second\nmember, viz. indra _s_ atru (the foe of p. 166 Indra); but by accenting it on\nthe first member, indra _s_ atru, he made it \'having Indra for his foe\n(slayer).\' According to the version of the Taitt. S., Agni, the fire, on the\nSoma being poured into it, rose up (spirted) as if to execute Tvash _t_ _ri_\n\'s wish; but immediately relapsed into its former state of inertness on\nhearing the mis-pronounced word.\n\n[166:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_388) Abhisambabhuva, \'he grew by consuming,\' &c. Saya\n_n_ a.\n\n[166:2](sbe1228.htm#fr_389) The Ka _n_ va text has, \'Danu and Danavi received\nhim as mother and father.\'\n\n[167:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_390) Preyuh, \'the gods &c. that were in V _ri_ tra\'s\nmouth went out,\' Saya _n_ a; see preceding page, note 1.\n\n[167:2](sbe1228.htm#fr_391) \'Yat saumyam nyaktam asa\' [\'yat saumyo nya\xe1\xb9\x85ga\nasa,\' Ka _n_ va rec.], \'what was imbued with Soma,\' \'what had Soma inherent in\nit.\' Cf. \'yat somasya nyaktam asa,\' I, 7, 1, 1.\n\n[167:3](sbe1228.htm#fr_392) \'People say so when anybody eats much food.\' Saya\n_n_ a.\n\n[167:4](sbe1228.htm#fr_393) See I, 6, 4, 15.\n\n[168:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_394) The nirvapanam, or taking out (literally throwing\nout) of (handfuls of) havis from the receptacle and putting it into the\nwinnowing basket (or other vessels), does not apply to these two kinds of\nsacrifices. Cf. I, 1, 2, 5 seq.\n\n[169:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_395) \'Yatame va yatame va dve apnoti.\' Saya _n_ a\nsupplies vastuni, \'objects.\' The Ka _n_ va recension, on the other hand,\nreads, \'Yatame va yatame va dve devate apnoti.\'\n\n[170:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_396) See [p. 80](sbe1213.htm#page_80), note\n[2](sbe1213.htm#fn_240). The objection here raised is, that the low-voiced\noffering, which is intermediate between the two above-mentioned oblations to\nAgni-Soma, is made to the same two deities.\n\n[170:2](sbe1228.htm#fr_397) When the two butter-portions to Agni and Soma are\noffered, the Hot _ri_ recites the verses Rig-veda VI, 16, 34 (Va _g_. S. 33,\n9), and Rig-veda, I, 95, 5 (Va _g_. S. 19, 42) respectively, as anuvakyas, or\ninvitatory prayers, each of which is followed by the ya _g_ ya (offering-\nformula): \'We who pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni (or Soma\nrespectively),--may Agni (Soma) pleased ( _g_ usha _n_ a _h_ ) accept of the\nbutter-oblation! Vausha _t_!\' At the low-voiced offering (upa _m_ _s_ uya _g_\na) to Agni-Soma, on the other hand, he first utters (in a low voice) as\nanuvakya the verse Rig-veda I, 93, 2, and thereupon as ya _g_ ya Rig-veda I,\n93, 6.\n\n[171:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_398) The two prayers of the low-voiced offering are\nmuttered in a low voice; but the \'Vausha _t_!\' at the end of the offering-\nprayer (as the \'Om!\' at the end of the invitatory prayer) is uttered aloud.\nHence the above symbolical explanation.\n\n[171:2](sbe1228.htm#fr_399) The same distinction is made in Rig-veda X, 90,\n10, where it is stated that from the Purusha sprang the horse and what other\nanimals with two rows of teeth (viz. the ass and mule, according to Saya _n_\na) on the one hand, and cows, goats, and sheep on the other. In Taitt. II, 2,\n6, 3, also the horse is mentioned along with man as belonging to the former\nclass of living beings. Cf. also Taitt. V, 1, 2, 6; Ath.-veda V, 19, 2; 31, 3;\nWeber, Ind. Stud. X, 58.\n\n[172:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_400) Sam-kramate, literally \'comes together with, meets\n(somebody).\' This symbolical explanation was probably suggested by the\ncircumstance that the full moon marks the junction (sandhi) of the two pakshas\nor half months; whereas the new moon (amavasya, \'dwelling together\') marks the\npoint of least distance between sun and moon.\n\n[172:2](sbe1228.htm#fr_401) Anyatoghatin, ? thus St. Petersburg Dictionary.\n\n[174:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_402) Katy. III, 3, 20-22 admits either mode of offering\nthe butter-portions. These oblations are effected in the following way:--The\nAdhvaryu, having called on the Hot _ri_ to recite the anuvakya, takes with the\ndipping-spoon (sruva) butter from the dhruva and puts it into the _g_ uhu; he\nthen draws some with the sruva from the butter-pot and replenishes the dhruva\nwith it [according to the Ka _n_ vas, with the text \'May the dhruva fatten\nwith the havis-butter, sacrifice after sacrifice, for those who go to the\ngods,--the udder of Surya in the lap of Aditi: may the earth flow abundantly\nat this sacrifice!\']. The same process is then repeated three (additional)\ntimes (with a _G_ amadagni four times): hence the offering is said to consist\nof four (or five) cuttings. The Hot _ri_ then recites the anuvakya (see note\non I, 6, 3, 27), which is followed by the Adhvaryu\'s call \'om _s_ ravaya\' and\nthe \xc3\x82gnidhra\'s response \'astu _s_ rausha _t_.\' Thereupon the Hot _ri_ , having\nbeen called upon by the Adhvaryu to give the offering-prayer to Agni (or\nSoma), recites the respective ya _g_ ya, at the concluding vausha _t_ of which\nthe oblation is poured into the fire, (whilst the sacrificer utters the usual\ndedicatory formula, \'This for Agni (Soma), not for me!\')\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 6, 4.
