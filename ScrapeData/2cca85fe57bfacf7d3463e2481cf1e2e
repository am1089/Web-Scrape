Now, then, as to the taking of milk as fast-food: the initiated\nshould take milk for his fast-food. Once upon a time the nectar of immortality\ndeparted from the gods.\n\n9:5:1:22\\. They said, 'Let us seek for it here by toil and penance!' They\nsought for it by toil and penance. Having become initiated, they were living\non fast-milk, for penance it is when, after becoming initiated, one lives on\nfast-milk. They heard the sound of it.\n\n9:5:1:33\\. They said, 'It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance\nstill further!' They resorted to three teats: they saw it.\n\n9:5:1:44\\. They said, 'It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance\nstill further!' They resorted to two teats: they saw it still nearer.\n\n9:5:1:55\\. They said, 'It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance\nstill further!' They resorted to one teat: it came nigh unto them, but they\ncould not lay hold of it.\n\n9:5:1:66\\. They said, 'It has indeed come nigh unto us, but we cannot lay hold\nof it: let us undergo the whole (practice of) penance!' On the day of\npreparation they underwent entire abstention from food; for the whole\n(practice of) penance it is when one abstains from food: let him therefore eat\nnothing on the day of preparation.\n\n9:5:1:77\\. On the morrow, having laid hold of it and pressed it (the Soma),\nthey offered (of it) in the fire,\n\np. 256\n\nand thereby bestowed immortality upon Agni. And he, Agni (the fire-altar),\nindeed, is the body of all the gods; and hence, when they bestowed immortality\non Agni (the fire-altar), they bestowed immortality on their own selves, and\nthereby the gods became immortal.\n\n9:5:1:88\\. Now that same nectar of immortality is Soma. And even to this day\nthe Sacrificer seeks for it by toil and penance; having become initiated he\nlives on fast-milk; for penance it is when, after being initiated, one lives\non fast-milk; he hears the sound of it, saying, 'On such and such a day the\nbuying (will take place 1)!'\n\n9:5:1:99\\. He resorts to three teats (of the cow): he sees it. He resorts to\ntwo teats: he sees it nearer by. He resorts to one teat: it comes nigh to him,\nbut he cannot lay hold of it. He undergoes entire abstinence from food; for\nthe whole (practice of) penance it is when one abstains from food: let him\ntherefore eat nothing on the day of preparation.\n\n9:5:1:1010\\. And, on the morrow, having laid hold of it, and pressed it, he\noffers (of it) in the fire, and thereby bestows immortality on Agni. He then\ndrinks (of it), and thereby bestows immortality on his own self, and becomes\nimmortal; for this, assuredly, is immortality to man when he attains the whole\n(perfect) life: and so, in truth, he attains the whole life by this self of\nhis.\n\n9:5:1:1111\\. When he has offered in the fire, he drinks (Soma); for that\n(fire-altar) is his divine body, and this (Sacrificer's own body) is his human\none; and\n\np. 257\n\nthe gods were first, and then men: therefore he drinks (Soma), after offering\nin the fire.\n\n9:5:1:1212\\. Now, then, the discussion of the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us\n(oblations): The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_ apati,\nentered upon their father Pra _g_ apati's inheritance, to wit, speech--truth\nand untruth, both truth and untruth: they, both of them, spake the truth, and\nthey both spake untruth; and, indeed, speaking alike, they were alike.\n\n9:5:1:1313\\. The gods relinquished untruth, and held fast to truth, and the\nAsuras relinquished truth, and held fast to untruth.\n\n9:5:1:1414\\. The truth which was in the Asuras beheld this, and said, 'Verily,\nthe gods have relinquished untruth, and held fast to truth: well, then, I will\ngo thither!' Thus it went over to the gods.\n\n9:5:1:1515\\. And the untruth which was in the gods beheld this, and said,\n'Verily, the Asuras have relinquished truth, and held fast to untruth: well,\nthen, I will go thither!' Thus it went over to the Asuras.\n\n9:5:1:1616\\. The gods spake nothing but truth, and the Asuras nothing but\nuntruth. And the gods, speaking the truth diligently, were very contemptible,\nand very poor: whence he who speaks the truth diligently, becomes indeed very\ncontemptible, and very poor; but in the end he assuredly prospers, for the\ngods indeed prospered.\n\n9:5:1:1717\\. And the Asuras, speaking untruth diligently, throve even as salt\nsoil 1, and were very prosperous: whence he who speaks untruth diligently,\nthrives indeed, even as salt soil, and becomes very prosperous;\n\np. 258\n\nbut in the end he assuredly comes to naught, for the Asuras indeed came to\nnaught.\n\n9:5:1:1818\\. Now that same truth, indeed, is this threefold lore 1. The gods\nsaid, 'Now that we have made up the sacrifice, let us spread out 2 this\ntruth!'\n\n9:5:1:1919\\. They prepared the Initiation-offering. But the Asuras became\naware of it, and said, 'Having made up the sacrifice, the gods are now\nspreading out that truth: come, let us fetch hither what was ours!' The Samish\n_t_ aya _g_ us of that (offering) was not yet performed, when they arrived:\nwhence people offer no Samish _t_ aya _g_ us 3 for that sacrifice. The gods,\nespying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else\n4. They (the Asuras) went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are\ndoing.'\n\n9:5:1:2020\\. When they had gone away, they (the gods) prepared the Opening-\noffering. But the Asuras\n\np. 259\n\nbecame aware of this also. The _S_ amyos (formula) of that (offering) had been\npronounced, when they arrived; whence that sacrifice ends with the _S_ amyos\n1. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing\nsomething else. They went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are\ndoing.'\n\n9:5:1:2121\\. When they had gone away, they (the gods), having bought and\ndriven about the king (Soma), prepared the guest-offering for him. But the\nAsuras became aware of this also. The I _d_ a of that (offering) had been\ninvoked, when they arrived; whence that sacrifice ends with the I _d_ a 2. The\ngods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something\nelse. They went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'\n\n9:5:1:2222\\. When they had gone away, they (the gods) spread out (performed)\nthe Upasads 3. When they had recited three kindling-verses, and no more, they\nmade offering to the deities, but laid out 4 no fore-offerings and no after-\nofferings on either side of the sacrifice, for they were in too great haste at\nthat time; whence at the Upasads, when he has recited three kindling-verses,\nand no more, he\n\np. 260\n\nmakes offering to the deities, but lays out no fore-offerings and no after-\nofferings on either side of the sacrifice.\n\n9:5:1:2323\\. On the day of preparation they slaughtered the Agnishomiya\nvictim. But the Asuras became aware of this also. The Samish _t_ aya _g_ us\noblations of this (offering) had not yet been offered, when they arrived;\nwhence people offer no Samish _t_ aya _g_ us for this animal(-offering). The\ngods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something\nelse. They went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'\n\n9:5:1:2424\\. On the next morning after they had gone away, they (the gods)\nspread out (performed) the morning-service (of the Soma-sacrifice). But the\nAsuras became aware of this also. As much as the morning-service had been\nperformed of it, when they arrived. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up\nthe sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away, thinking, 'It\nis something else they are doing.'\n\n9:5:1:2525\\. When they had gone, they (the gods) spread out the midday-\nservice. But the Asuras became aware of this also. As much as the midday-\nservice had been performed of it, when they arrived. The gods, espying the\nAsuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went\naway, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'\n\n9:5:1:2626\\. When they had gone, (the gods) went on with the animal-offering\nof the Soma-sacrifice 1.\n\np. 261\n\n[paragraph continues] But the Asuras became aware of this also. As much of\nthis animal-offering as is done (at the evening-service) had been done, when\nthey arrived. The gods, espying them, snatched up the sacrifice, and began\ndoing something else. They went away, thinking, 'It is something else they are\ndoing.'\n\n9:5:1:2727\\. When they had gone away, they (the gods) spread the evening-\nservice and completed it; and by completing it they obtained that whole truth.\nThen the Asuras went down 1. Then the gods prevailed, and the Asuras came to\nnaught. And, indeed, he who knows this, himself prevails, and his spiteful\nenemy comes to naught.\n\n9:5:1:2828\\. The gods said, 'Those sacrifices of ours which are half-\ncompleted, and leaving behind which we went off 2,--think ye upon this, how we\nmay complete them!' They said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they meant to\nsay, 'Seek ye how we may complete these sacrifices!'\n\n9:5:1:2929\\. Whilst meditating, they saw these Samish _t_ aya _g_ us\n(oblations), and offered them, and thereby completed those sacrifices; and\ninasmuch as thereby they completed (sa _m_ sthapaya) them, they are 'sa _m_\nsthitaya _g_ us'; and inasmuch as thereby they sacrificed completely (sa _m_\n-ya _g_  3), they are 'samish _t_ aya _g_ us.'\n\n9:5:1:3030\\. Now there are nine such (incomplete) sacrifices,\n\np. 262\n\nand there are nine samish _t_ aya _g_ us-oblations 1; and by offering these,\nhe completes those sacrifices. He offers both kinds, those of the Soma-\nsacrifice, and those of the Agni(- _k_ ayana),--first those of the Soma-\nsacrifice, and afterwards those of the fire-altar: the significance of this\nhas been explained.\n\n9:5:1:3131\\. Two he offers of the fire-altar,--two-footed is the Sacrificer,\nand Agni is the Sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,\nwith so much he thus completes the sacrifice. [He offers them, with, Va _g_.\nS. XVIII, 56, 57], 'Sacrifice hath been offered, up by the Bh _ri_ gus . .\n.;'--'May Agni who hath received sacrifice and oblation speed our offered\nmeat!'\n\n9:5:1:3232\\. These two amount to eleven,--the Trish _t_ ubh consists of eleven\nsyllables, and the Trish _t_ ubh means strength: it is strength he thus\nimparts to the Sacrificer.\n\n9:5:1:3333\\. And, again, as to why there are eleven,--the Trish _t_ ubh\nconsists of eleven syllables, and Indra is of trish _t_ ubh nature, Indra is\nthe self (soul) of the sacrifice, Indra is the deity 2: he thus finally\nestablishes the sacrifice in him who is the self, the deity of the sacrifice.\n\n9:5:1:3434\\. Having performed the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us-oblations, they betake\nthemselves to the expiatory bath (avabh _ri_ tha 3). Having come out from the\nbath,\n\np. 263\n\nand performed the Udayaniya (concluding oblation) 1, he, after the animal cake\nof the offering of the barren cow 2, prepares oblations for the goddesses.\n\n9:5:1:3535\\. For now Pra _g_ apati, having gained his end, thought himself\nquite perfect. Establishing himself in the quarters he went on ordering (or\ncreating) and disposing everything here; and inasmuch as he went on ordering\nand disposing, he is the Orderer. And in like manner does the Sacrificer,\nestablishing himself in the quarters, order and dispose everything here.\n\n9:5:1:3636\\. And, again, as to why he prepares these oblations. This Agni (the\nfire-altar) is the quarters (regions), and these he lays down beforehand (in\nthe shape of) the bunch of Darbha grass 3 and the clod-bricks 4; the Pra _n_\nabh _ri_ ts 5 in the first layer, the whole of the second, the whole of the\nthird, and the whole of the fourth (layers 6); and of the fifth\n\np. 264\n\nlayer the Asapatnas, Nakasads and Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as 1,--these kept\ngoing out upwards 2 (from Pra _g_ apati, the altar). Pra _g_ apati was afraid\nof them, thinking, 'Whilst moving away, these will go beyond this universe.'\nHaving become the Orderer, he went round them and established himself in them.\n\n9:5:1:3737\\. Now the same as that Orderer is yonder sun; and that which was\nthe farthest gone of the regions is that in which that (sun) shines firmly\nestablished.\n\n9:5:1:3838\\. And the same as that Orderer is this cake to the Orderer on\ntwelve potsherds. On twelve potsherds (it is),--the year is (of) twelve\nmonths, Pra _g_ apati is the year, and Pra _g_ apati is the Orderer. And that\none which was the farthest gone of the regions is the same as these previous\noblations,--a pap to Anumati, a pap to Raka, a pap to Sinivali, and a pap to\nKuhu 3: when he prepares these oblations, he thereby establishes him (Pra _g_\napati) in that which was the farthest gone of the regions. That (cake) he\noffers whole, for the completeness of that (Pra _g_ apati).\n\n9:5:1:3939\\. These are goddesses, for they are the regions,\n\np. 265\n\nthe regions are the metres, and the metres are deities; and that Ka is Pra _g_\napati; and inasmuch as they are goddesses (devi) and Ka, they are 'devika _h_\n1.' There are five of them, for there are five regions.\n\n9:5:1:4040\\. As to this they say, 'He should not offer these oblations, lest\nhe should do what is excessive.' Let him nevertheless offer them; for these\noblations are offered for (the fulfilment) of (special) wishes, and in wishes\nthere is nothing excessive. And whatever oblation is offered after the cake of\nthe animal-offering that is placed inside the victim itself as its sacrificial\nsap. He offers both kinds (of oblations), those of the Soma-sacrifice and\nthose of the Agni(- _k_ ayana), to wit, first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and\nthen those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained. The\ncake-offering of the animal sacrifice is (performed) in a loud voice, and\nthese (five oblations) in a low voice, for they are an ish _t_ i 2. With the\nPa _s_ upuro _d_ a _s_ a he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Recite!--Urge!' and with\nthese (oblations), 'Recite!--Worship!' for they are an ish _t_ i 3. There is\nthe same Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, and the same I _d_ a 4.\n\n9:5:1:4141\\. Of that same animal-offering (of the barren cow) they perform the\nSamish _t_ aya _g_ us-oblations; they enter the expiatory bath with the heart-\nspit 5;\n\np. 266\n\nfor this animal-offering is the end. Having proceeded with the heart-spit;--\n\n9:5:1:4242\\. And having returned (to the fire-altar), he performs the\noblations to Vi _s_ vakarman;--This Agni(- _k_ ayana) indeed (includes) all\nsacrificial rites (vi _s_ vani karma _n_ i); and all these its rites have been\nperformed in this (agni _k_ ayana): he now gratifies them, and makes them a\ndeity by means of an offering of sacrificial food; for only that one is a\ndeity, for whom an oblation is prepared, but not one for whom it is not\n(prepared). Moreover, this Agni is Vi _s_ vakarman (the all-worker): it is him\nhe thereby gratifies.\n\n9:5:1:4343\\. And, again, as to why he offers the Vai _s_ vakarma _n_ a\n(oblations) 1. For the fire-altar there is both a beginning and an end: the\nSavitra 2 (formulas) are the beginning, and the Vai _s_ vakarma _n_ a\n(oblations) the end. Were he to offer only those to Savit _ri_ , and not those\nto Vi _s_ vakarman, it would be as if he made only a beginning and no end; and\nwere he to offer only those to Vi _s_ vakarman, and not those to Savit _ri_ ,\nit would be as if he made only an end and no beginning. He offers both of\nthem, and thus makes both a beginning and an end.\n\n9:5:1:4444\\. There are eight of those (Savitra), and so (there are eight of)\nthese: thus he makes the end\n\np. 267\n\n(the same) as the beginning. The Svaha-call is the ninth of those 1, and so it\nis of these: thus he makes the end as the beginning. The oblation (ahuti) is\nthe tenth of those 2, and so it is of these: thus he makes the end as the\nbeginning. On that occasion he offers the oblation continuously so as not to\nstop the seed, the sacrifice there being seed;--on this occasion (he offers)\nwith the dipping-spoon at the Svaha-call, for manifest is the seed when it is\nborn.\n\n9:5:1:4545\\. [He offers, with, Va _g_. S. XVII, 58-65], 'What hath flowed from\nout of the will, or the heart, or was gathered from the mind, or the eye,\nafter that go ye forward,--to the world of the righteous whither the first-\nborn seers went of old!' he thereby means those _Ri_ shis 3.\n\n9:5:1:4646\\. 'Unto thee, O (heavenly) seat, I commit this treasure which the\nknower of beings shall bring thither 4! Here the lord of the sacrifice will go\nafter you: acknowledge ye 5 him in the highest heaven!'--as the text, so the\nmeaning.\n\n9:5:1:4747\\. 'Acknowledge him, O ye gods, seated\n\np. 268\n\nin the highest heaven, know ye his form! When he cometh by the godward paths,\nreveal ye unto him the fulfilment of his wishes!'--as the text, so the\nmeaning.--'Awake, O Agni, and be watchful! . . .'--'Whereby thou carriest a\nthousand, . . .'--the meaning of these two has been explained 1.\n\n9:5:1:4848\\. 'With grass-bunch and enclosing-stick, with spoon, altar-ground\nand grass-cover, with verse of praise, lead thou this our sacrifice unto\nheaven, to go unto the gods!' that is, 'with these outward forms of our\nsacrifice make it go to the heavenly world!'\n\n9:5:1:4949\\. 'What gift, what bounty, what fulfilment, what offering-presents\nthere are of ours,--Agni Vai _s_ vakarma _n_ a shall deposit them in heaven\nwith the gods!'--that is, 'whatever we give, seasonably or unseasonably, that\nthis fire-altar of Vi _s_ vakarman shall place in the heavenly world!'\n\n9:5:1:5050\\. 'Where the streams of honey and ghee are never-failing,--there,\nin heaven, Agni Vai _s_ vakarma _n_ a shall place us with the gods!'--as the\ntext, so the meaning 2.\n\n9:5:1:5151\\. Eight Vai _s_ vakarma _n_ a (oblations) he offers,--the Gayatri\nconsists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gayatra nature: as great as Agni\nis, as great\n\np. 269\n\nas is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.\n\n9:5:1:5252\\. When he has performed the Vai _s_ vakarma _n_ a (oblations), he\ngives a name 1 (to the fire of the altar); for when any one has been born\nsound and safe, they give a name to him, and now this (Agni) has indeed been\nborn sound and safe.\n\n9:5:1:5353\\. Having given a name to him, he reverently approaches him; for\nthis (Sacrificer) builds him with his (own) whole self, and were he not to\ngive utterance now to this surrender of his own self, he (Agni) would now take\naway his (the Sacrificer's) self; but when he now gives utterance to this\nsurrender of his own self, he (Agni) does not take away his self. [He\napproaches the fire] with the Anush _t_ ubh verse (Va _g_. S. XVIII, 67),\n'What fires of the five races of men there are upon this earth,--thou art the\nchiefest of them: quicken us unto life!'--the Anush _t_ ubh, doubtless, is\nspeech, and all the metres are speech 2: he thus makes amends to him (Agni) by\nall the metres. Having stood by the fire, and lifted 3 it, and churned it out,\nhe offers the completing oblation 4.\n\np. 270\n\n9:5:1:5454\\. He then offers a dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varu _n_ a 1.\nNow he who performs this (Agni- _k_ ayana) rite comes to be with the gods; and\nthese two, Mitra and Varu _n_ a, are a divine pair. Now, were he to have\nintercourse with a human woman without having offered this (oblation), it\nwould be a descent, as if one who is divine would become human; but when he\noffers this dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varu _n_ a, he thereby\napproaches a divine mate 2: having offered it, he may freely have intercourse\nin a befitting way.\n\n9:5:1:5555\\. And, again, as to why he offers this dish of clotted curds to\nMitra and Varu _n_ a. When Pra _g_ apati was released, the seed fell from him.\nWhen the gods restored him, they, by means of this dish of clotted curds, put\nseed into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby put seed into\nhim.\n\n9:5:1:5656\\. Now that Pra _g_ apati who became released is this very fire-\naltar which is here being built; and the seed which fell from him is this dish\nof clotted curds of Mitra and Varu _n_ a; for Mitra and Varu _n_ a are the in-\nbreathing and up-breathing, and the in-breathing and up-breathing fashion the\ninfused seed. A dish of clotted curds it is, because seed is milk; and\nsacrifice it is, because sacrifice is the seed of sacrifice. In a low voice it\nis (offered), for silently seed is shed. At the end (of the sacrifice) it is\n(offered), for from the end seed is introduced.\n\np. 271\n\n9:5:1:5757\\. They proceed with the whey 1 of that (dish of clotted curds). At\nthis (oblation of whey) he gives a dakshi _n_ a (sacrificial gift): 'Let him\ngive a pair of hornless he-goats,' so (they say);--'Only by assignment, I\nthink 2:' said Mahitthi. And, verily, this libation of the fire-builder flows\naway as a libation of Soma which one offers on a (fire) without bricks.\n\n9:5:1:5858\\. He need only lay down the naturally-perforated (bricks) 3; for\nthe naturally-perforated ones are these worlds; and this built fire-altar is\nthe same as these worlds.\n\n9:5:1:5959\\. He need only lay down the seasonal (bricks); for the seasonal\nones are the year, and this built fire-altar is the year.\n\n9:5:1:6060\\. He need only lay down the all-light (bricks); for the all-light\n(bricks) are those deities 4, and this built fire-altar is those deities.\n\n9:5:1:6161\\. He need only lay down the Puna _s_ _k_ iti; for this is a\nrepeated sacrifice (punar-ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a), it is a later (higher) worship of the\ngods: it is thus a repeated sacrifice and the higher worship of the gods he\nthereby arranges, and the repeated sacrifice inclines to him 5!--so (they\nsay), but let him not do this,\n\np. 272\n\nfor, indeed, whenever Agni is placed on the built (altar), this whole Agni\npasses into that very brick 1: thus whenever he offers in the fire, then these\noblations of his will be offered even as would be his oblations, when offered\non a complete _S_ a _n_ _d_ ila fire-altar built up with wings and tail.\n\n9:5:1:6262\\. And, indeed, he who carries about Agni 2 becomes pregnant with\nall beings, and with all the gods; and he who builds him when he has not been\ncarried about for a year kills all beings in the form of an embryo. But,\nsurely, he who kills a human embryo, is despised, how much more then he who\nkills him (Agni), for he is a god: 'Let no one become an officiating priest\nfor an (Agni) who has not been carried about for a year,' said Vatsya, 'lest\nhe should be a participator in the killing of this, a god's seed 3!'\n\np. 273\n\n9:5:1:6363\\. 'A six-month (Agni) is the last 1 he may build,' they say, 'for\nsix-month embryos are the last 1 that live when born.' If he were to recite\nthe Great Litany on one not carried for a year, he should recite (only) the\neighties of verses, for something incomplete is (the Agni) not carried for a\nyear, and something incomplete are the eighties of verses 2. But, indeed, he\nwould only still further pull asunder that (Agni, already) pulled asunder 3;\nand, indeed, whether he (Agni) be carried for a year, or not carried for a\nyear, he (the Hot _ri_ ) should recite the whole of the Great Litany.\n\n9:5:1:6464\\. Now _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilyayana was once upon a time sojourning in the\neastern region. Daiyampati said to him, ' _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilyayana, how is Agni\nto be built? For, indeed, we are loth to carry him for a year, and yet we wish\nto build him.'\n\n9:5:1:6565\\. He said, 'Let him by all means build him by whom he has\npreviously been carried for a year; for that, that (Agni) alone He builds as\none that has been carried 4 (as a child in the womb).'\n\n9:5:1:6666\\. And, indeed, let him by all means build who\n\np. 274\n\nintends to press Soma for a year, for he, manifestly, supports him by food (in\nthe shape of) those libations.\n\n9:5:1:6767\\. And, indeed, let him by all means build who offers the Agnihotra\nfor a year, for he who offers the Agnihotra indeed supports him (Agni, the\nfire).\n\n9:5:1:6868\\. And, indeed, let him by all means build who was born a year\n(after conception); for Agni is the breath; it is thus him (Agni) he holds.\nAnd, indeed, as the breath, he enters into the infused seed, and takes\npossession of it; and inasmuch as he takes possession (vid) of every one that\nis born ( _g_ ata), he is _G_ atavedas. Wherefore by all means let even one\nwho knows this build him as one ever carried (within him). And, indeed, if one\nwho knows this either drinks (Soma), or offers drink to any one else, these\nlibations of his will be offered even as would be his libations, when offered\non a complete _S_ a _n_ _d_ ila fire-altar built up with wings and tail.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[256:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_455) That is, the buying of the Soma plants, for which\nsee part ii, p. 69 seq.\n\n[257:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_456) Both salt (V, 2, 1, 16; VII, 1, 1, 6) and saline\nsoil (VII, 3, 1, 8) mean cattle.\n\n[258:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_457) That is, the Veda, and hence the sacrificial\nritual as the sole end for which the three collections of hymn-verses ( _ri_\n_k_ ), hymn-tunes (saman), and sacrificial formulas (ya _g_ us) were made.\n\n[258:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_458) The verb 'tan,' 'to spread,' is the regular\nexpression for the 'performing' of the sacrifice,--a figure of speech taken\nfrom the spreading out of a web, in which literal sense it has to be taken\nhere.\n\n[258:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_459) See III, 1, 3, 6, where the injunction is given\nthat no Samish _t_ aya _g_ us should be performed for the Diksha _n_ iyesh _t_\ni, 'lest he who has put on the garment of initiation should reach the end of\nthe sacrifice before its completion; for the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us is the end\nof the sacrifice.' It should be remembered that the initiation-offering,\nhowever essential, is merely a preliminary ceremony of the Soma-sacrifice, at\nthe end of which latter sacrifice nine Samish _t_ aya _g_ us oblations are\noffered (IV, 4, 4, 1 seq.) instead of the single one offered at the ordinary\nhavirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a. The term signifies 'the formula (ya _g_ us) of the\ncompleted offering (samish _t_ a).'\n\n[258:4](sbe4343.htm#fr_460) Prof. Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, p. 429, makes this\nlast clause part of the Asuras' speech or  thoughts,--'one thing they have\nundertaken to do, and another they are doing.' This can hardly be right.\n\n[259:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_461) See III, 2, 3, 23, where it is stated that the\nPraya _n_ iya of the Soma-sacrifice is to end with the _S_ amyos (or _S_\namyuvaka, for which see part i, p. 254 seq.); the Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as (and\nSamish _t_ aya _g_ us) of the ordinary ish _t_ i being thus omitted.\n\n[259:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_462) For the \xc3\x82tithya, see part ii, p. 85 seq. It is\nshorn of the after-offerings (in addition to the Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as and\nSamish _t_ aya _g_ us).\n\n[259:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_463) For the Upasads, see part ii, p. 204 seq.\n\n[259:4](sbe4343.htm#fr_464) That is, performed; but the verb (ut-sadaya, 'to\nset out, or in order') is used purposely, as if laying out for display,--so as\nto be in keeping with the 'spreading out' of the sacrifice.\n\n[260:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_465) The portions from the Savaniya pa _s_ u, which is\nslain during the morning-service, continue being cooked until the evening-\nservice, when they are offered. See IV, 2, 5, 13; and part ii, p. 357, note.\n\n[261:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_466) Literally, leapt down (from their high station).\n\n[261:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_467) That is, which we left behind us when we went off.\n\n[261:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_468) Cf. IV, 4, 4, 6. For whatever deities this\nsacrifice is performed, they all are thereby 'sacrificed-to together' (sam-ish\n_t_ a); and because, after all those (deities) have been 'sacrificed-to\ntogether,' he now offers those (libations), therefore they are called Samish\n_t_ aya _g_ us. See also I, 9, 2, 26, with note thereto.\n\n[262:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_469) That is to say, the same nine Samish _t_ aya _g_\nus-oblations which are performed at the end of the Soma-sacrifice (IV, 4, 4, 1\nseq.). At the end of these, however, two additional such oblations are offered\non the present occasion.\n\n[262:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_470) See I, 4, 5, 4, 'Indra is the deity of (this?)\nsacrifice;' IV, 4, 2, 16, 'Indra is the leader of the sacrifice.' The first of\nthe nine Samish _t_ aya _g_ us-oblations of the Soma-sacrifice is offered to\nIndra.\n\n[262:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_471) See IV, 4, 5, 1 seq.\n\n[263:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_472) See IV, 5, 2, 1 seq.\n\n[263:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_473) For this offering to Mitra and Varu _n_ a, see IV,\n5, 1, 5.\n\n[263:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_474) The bunch of Darbha grass is placed in the centre\nof the newly ploughed altar-site; see VII, 2, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[263:4](sbe4343.htm#fr_475) The four logesh _t_ akas (clods of earth), being\nplaced at the ends of the two 'spines,' represent the four quarters, marking\nas they do the centre of the east, south, west, and north sides of the altar-\nsite, sown with seeds of all kinds; see VII, 3, I, 13 seq. The bunch of Darbha\ngrass, placed in the centre, would thus represent the fifth region, viz. the\none above.\n\n[263:5](sbe4343.htm#fr_476) Though the Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ts are said to\nrepresent, not the regions, but the (channels of the) vital airs, they are\nplaced in rows along the diagonals of the square body of the altar, thus\nmarking, as it were, the intermediate regions; whilst the fifth set is placed\nin a circle round the centre. See [VIII, 1, 1, 1](sbe4303.htm#8:1:1:1) seq.\n\n[263:6](sbe4343.htm#fr_477) The bricks of these layers are all of them\nsupposed to be marked by their position to relate to the regions or quarters.\n\n[264:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_478) For the Asapatnas, laid down near the ends of the\nspines, to drive off evil in all four quarters, see [VIII, 5, 1,\n1](sbe4319.htm#8:5:1:1); for the other two kinds of bricks, expressly\nidentified with the regions, see [VIII, 6, 1, 1](sbe4323.htm#8:6:1:1) seq.\n\n[264:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_479) That is, the altar was so full of regions that\nthey escaped at the top.\n\n[264:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_480) These deities are supposed to be personifications\nof the four phases of the moon; whilst Prof. Weber (Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 290)\nwould also take the Orderer (dhat _ri_ )--by the Brahma _n_ a identified with\nthe sun--to represent the moon. On Sinivali (identified with Va _k_ , VI, 5,\n1, 9), see also A. Kuhn, Zeitschr. f. v. Sprachf. II, p. 120; Weber, Ind.\nStud. V, 230. Anumati is identified with the earth, V, 2, 3, 4.\n\n[265:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_481) This is an etymological quibble resorted to in\norder to account for the oblation to Pra _g_ apati as one of the oblations of\nthe goddesses (devika).\n\n[265:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_482) See [p. 248](sbe4341.htm#page_248), note\n[1](sbe4341.htm#fn_426).\n\n[265:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_483) See ibid., note [2](sbe4341.htm#fn_427).\n\n[265:4](sbe4343.htm#fr_484) That is, for these five oblations which are\ninserted between the chief oblations and the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t of the Pa _s_\nupuro _d_ a _s_ a; as above, [IX, 4, 3, 12](sbe4341.htm#9:4:3:12) seq.\n\n[265:5](sbe4343.htm#fr_485) For this expiatory ceremony, called the _S_\nulavabh _ri_ tha (spit-bath), p. 266 and marking the conclusion of an ordinary\n(niru _dh_ a) animal sacrifice--not one belonging to the Soma-sacrifice--as\nwell as of the offering of a sterile cow, see part ii, p. 215.\n\n[266:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_486) Or, perhaps, formulas; the verses used along with\nthe oblations being ascribed to Vi _s_ vakarman. In any case, however, these\noblations are offered to Agni, as the Vi _s_ vakarman, or all-worker (vi _s_\nvakart _ri_ ), or (in the case of Agni = Agni _k_ ayana) as including all\nworks (or sacrificial performances).\n\n[266:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_487) See VI, 3, 1, 1 seq.; part iii, p. 290 seq.\n\n[267:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_488) See VI, 3, 1, 21.\n\n[267:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_489) The Savitra formulas accompany eight libations,\nwhich form, however, only one single continuous offering (ahuti) with one\nsvaha-call.\n\n[267:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_490) For the seven _Ri_ shis, identified with the vital\nairs, the first existing beings, see VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[267:4](sbe4343.htm#fr_491) Mahidhara (and apparently Saya _n_ a) seems to\nsupply 'ya _g_ amanam' to 'etam,' and construe thus: 'Unto thee, O heavenly\nsent, I commit this (Sacrificer), which treasure _G_ atavedas shall bring\nthither.'\n\n[267:5](sbe4343.htm#fr_492) 'O gods, honour ye him (the Sacrificer)!'\nMahidhara; but perhaps the _Ri_ shis are addressed in this second line.\nMahidhara takes 'atra' ('here') along with 'parame vyoman'--'in this highest\nheaven.'\n\n[268:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_493) See [VIII, 6, 3, 23](sbe4325.htm#8:6:3:23),\n[24](sbe4325.htm#8:6:3:24).\n\n[268:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_494) The meaning of the verse is, however, far from\ncertain. The above is Mahidhara's interpretation, except that he takes 'ya _h_\n' to mean 'and what (other) streams there are.' It might, however, also\nmean--'What streams of honey and ghee of ours are never-failing anywhere--Agni\nVai _s_ vakarma _n_ a shall deposit them in heaven with the gods!'--in which\ncase due reward for sacrifice would be prayed for.\n\n[269:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_495) According to VI, 1, 3, 20, the newly built Agni is\nto be called ' _K_ itra,' the Bright one.\n\n[269:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_496) Or, are Va _k_ , the Veda, cf. IV, 6, 7, 1 seq.\n\n[269:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_497) Or, 'having mounted it;'--that is to say, he heats\nthe churning-sticks (ara _n_ i) at the altar-fire, betakes himself with them\nto the old (Garhapatya) fire-place; 'churns out' the fire, and offers on the\nfire thus produced.\n\n[269:4](sbe4343.htm#fr_498) The Udavasaniya-ish _t_ i, consisting of a cake on\nfive potsherds for Agni (or a libation of ghee taken in five ladlings for Vish\n_n_ u), is the same as for the Soma-sacrifice, IV, 5, I, 13. But whilst there\nit is followed at once by the (evening) Agnihotra, or oblation of milk\nregularly performed twice a day; on the present occasion an additional\noblation is performed.\n\n[270:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_499) The same payasya-oblation is performed at the\nDakshaya _n_ a modification of the new and full-moon sacrifice (II, 4, 4, 10\nseq.); sec also the Sannayya of the new-moon sacrifice (part i, p. 178, note\n4) which is the same dish.\n\n[270:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_500) Or, he enters into a divine union.\n\n[271:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_501) The whey (va _g_ ina) is offered to the (divine)\nCoursers, i.e. the regions or quarters; see II, 4, 4, 22-25.\n\n[271:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_502) The meaning of this passage is not quite clear to\nme.\n\n[271:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_503) The three Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ as in the centre\nof the first, third, and fifth layers represent the three worlds. These, and\nthe subsequent injunctions, refer to one who, subsequent to the Agni _k_\nayana, wishes to perform a Soma-sacrifice, without being able to repeat the\nAgni _k_ ayana itself. Katy. Sr. XVIII, 6, 33.\n\n[271:4](sbe4343.htm#fr_504) See VI, 3, 3, 16; 5, 3, where the three Vi _s_ va\n_g_ yotis bricks are said to represent Agni, Vayu (wind), and \xc3\x82ditya (sun)\nrespectively.\n\n[271:5](sbe4343.htm#fr_505) Though there is nothing in the text to show where\nthis quotation p. 272 begins, it would seem, from Katyayana's rules, that it\nruns from the beginning of paragraph 58,--XVIII, 6, 33. In case of inability\n(to perform a second) _k_ itya, at a repeated Soma-sacrifice, (he may lay\ndown) one or other kind of the Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ as, Vi _s_ va _g_\nyotishas, or _Ri_ tavyas; 34. The Puna _s_ _k_ iti; 35. Or no building (at all\na second time); 36. Because the (Agni) _K_ itya has become the \xc3\x82havaniya.\n\n[272:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_506) That is (as would seem from Saya _n_ a's\ninterpretation), into the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, considered as the last brick of the\naltar; and hence the Sacrificer's offering-fire will for ever thereafter\nremain for him the _K_ itya Agni.\n\n[272:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_507) During the time of initiation (diksha), which, if\nat all possible, is to last for a year, the Ukhya Agni has to be carried about\nby the intending Sacrificer, for at least part of each day, in the fire-pan\n(ukha), suspended in a sling from his neck; the pan-fire being afterwards\ntransferred to the newly built Garhapatya and thence to the great fire-altar,\nto serve as the _K_ itya Agni, or the \xc3\x82havaniya fire. See VI, 7, I, 12 seq.\n\n[272:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_508) In the original this last clause is in the first\nperson,, or in the _oratio directa_ , from the point of view of him who is\nasked to officiate p. 273 as a priest, hence--Let no one become an officiating\npriest . . ., thinking, 'Lest I should be a participator . . .'\n\n[273:1](sbe4343.htm#fr_510) That is to say, he must have been carried about\nfor at least six months; and embryos less than six months old cannot live.\n\n[273:2](sbe4343.htm#fr_511) This is so for the reason that the Mahad uktham\nconsists of more than the eighties of verses; see [IX, 3, 3,\n19](sbe4337.htm#9:3:3:19). One might feel inclined to include this whole\nsentence in the preceding quotation.\n\n[273:3](sbe4343.htm#fr_512) That is, already too much attenuated, by being\nmade as large as one a year old (?).\n\n[273:4](sbe4343.htm#fr_513) Saya _n_ a remarks, that this reply does not\nrestrict the building of the fire-altar to one who has carried the fire for a\nfull year, but only discountenances the building in the case of one who has\nonly carried it for a few days (?).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 5, 2.
