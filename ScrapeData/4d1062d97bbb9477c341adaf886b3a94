Freedom of Will.--It follows that in so far as man shares in the\nempiric world his whole moral and physical life is at every instant strictly\npredestined. But at the same time his Self is implicitly free, inasmuch as in\nessence it is one with the Absolute Brahma, no matter how it be empirically\nsunk in the phenomenal world; and as soon as he attains the knowledge of this\nfundamental unity which is itself salvation, his freedom is complete; he is\nthe One Absolute Brahma, and beside him there exists no empiric world.\n[1](brk25.htm#fn_2)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: God](brk25.htm)\n\n'
