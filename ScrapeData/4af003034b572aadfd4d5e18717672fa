Wilkins, [1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 353\n\n### CHAPTER X.\n\n#### THE PUR\xc4\x80NIC DIVISIONS OF TIME.\n\nThe three main divisions of time employed in the Hindu Scriptures are Yugas,\nManvantaras, and Kalpas. * These will now be described.\n\nThere are four Yugas, which together extend to 12,000 _divine_ years. Their\nrespective duration is as follows:--\n\nThe Krita Yuga\n\n|\n\n= 4,800\n\n|\n\ndivine years.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nThe Tret\xc4\x81 Yuga\n\n|\n\n= 3,600\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e \xe2\x80\x9e  \n  \nThe Dv\xc4\x81para Yuga\n\n|\n\n= 2,400\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e \xe2\x80\x9e  \n  \nThe K\xc4\x81li Yuga\n\n|\n\n= 1,200\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e \xe2\x80\x9e  \n  \n"One year of mortals is equal to one day of the gods." As 360 is taken as the\nnumber of days in the year--\n\nThe Krita Yuga\n\n|\n\n= 4,800 x 360\n\n|\n\n=\n\n|\n\n1,728,000\n\n|\n\nyears of mortals.  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nThe Tret\xc4\x81, Yuga\n\n|\n\n= 3,600 x 360\n\n|\n\n=\n\n|\n\n1,296,000\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e \xe2\x80\x9e  \n  \nThe Dv\xc4\x81para Yuga\n\n|\n\n= 2,400 x 360\n\n|\n\n=\n\n|\n\n864,000\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e \xe2\x80\x9e  \n  \nThe K\xc4\x81li Yuga\n\n|\n\n= 1,200 x 360\n\n|\n\n=\n\n|\n\n432,000\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e \xe2\x80\x9e  \n  \nOne Mah\xc4\x81yuga, or Great Age, including the four lesser Yugas, therefore, being\n12,000 divine years = 4,320,000 years of mortals. "A thousand such Mah\xc4\x81yugas\nare a\n\np. 354\n\nday of Brahm\xc4\x81," and his nights are of equal duration; a _Kalpa_ , therefore,\nor Day, of Brahm\xc4\x81 extends over 4,320,000,000 ordinary years. "Within each\nKalpa 14 Manus reign; a Manvantara, or period of a Manu, therefore, is\nconsequently one-fourteenth part of a Kalpa, or day of Brahm\xc4\x81.\n\n"In the present Kalpa, six Manus, of whom Swyambhuva was the first, have\nalready passed away; the present being Vaivasata. In each Manvantara (period\nof a Manu), seven Rishis, certain deities, an Indra and a Manu, and the kings,\nhis sons, are created and perish. A thousand systems of the four Yugas occur\ncoincidentally with these fourteen Manvantaras, and consequently about 71\nsystems of four Yugas elapse during each Manvantara, and measure the lives of\nthe Manus and the deities of the period. At the close of this day of Brahm\xc4\x81, a\ncollapse of the universe takes place, which lasts through a night of Brahm\xc4\x81,\nequal in duration to his day, during which period the worlds are converted\ninto one great ocean, when the lotus-born god (Brahm\xc4\x81), expanded by his\ndeglutition of the universe, and contemplated by the Yogis and gods in\nJanaloka, sleeps on the serpent Sesha. At the end of that night he awakes and\ncreates anew.\n\n"A year of Brahm\xc4\x81 is composed of the proper number of such days and nights,\nand a hundred of such years constitute his whole life. The period of his life\nis called _Para_ , and the half of it _Par \xc4\x81rddha_, or the half of a _Para_.\nOne Par\xc4\x81rddha, or half of Brahm\xc4\x81\'s existence, has now expired, terminating\nwith the great Kalpa called the Padma Kalpa. The now existing Kalpa, or day of\nBrahm\xc4\x81, called Var\xc4\x81ha (or that of the boar), is the first of the second\nPar\xc4\x81rddha of Brahm\xc4\x81\'s existence. The dissolution which occurs at the end of\neach Kalpa,\n\np. 355\n\nor day of Brahm\xc4\x81, is called _naimittika_ , incidental, occasional, or\ncontingent." *\n\nThe dissolution of existing beings is of three kinds: "incidental, elemental,\nand absolute." \xe2\x80\xa0 The first is _naimittika_ , occasional, incidental, or\nBr\xc4\x81hmya, as occasioned by the intervals of Brahm\xc4\x81\'s days; the destruction of\ncreatures, though not of the substance of the world, occurring during the\nnight. The second is the general resolution of the elements into their\nprimitive source, or Prakriti, the Pr\xc4\x81kritika destruction, and occurs at the\nend of Brahm\xc4\x81\'s life. The third, the absolute, or final, \xc4\x80lyantika, is\nindividual annihilation, Moksha, exemption for ever from future existence.\n\nThe process of destruction is described as follows:--\n\n"At the end of a thousand periods of four ages the earth is for the most part\nexhausted. A total death then ensues, which lasts a hundred years, and in\nconsequence of the failure of food all beings become languid and exanimate,\nand at last entirely perish. The eternal Vishnu then assumes the character of\nRudra, the destroyer, and descends to reunite all his creatures with himself.\nHe enters into the seven rays of the sun, drinks up all the waters of the\nglobe, and causes all moisture whatever, in living bodies or in the soil, to\nevaporate, thus drying up the whole earth. The seas, the rivers, the mountain-\ntorrents, and springs are all exhaled, and so are all the waters of P\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81la,\nthe regions .below the earth.\n\n"Thus fed, through his intervention, with abundant moisture, the seven solar\nrays dilate to seven suns, whose radiance glows above, below, and on every\nside, and sets the three worlds and P\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81la on fire. The three worlds, consumed\nby these suns, become rugged and deformed\n\np. 356\n\nthroughout the whole extent of their mountains, rivers, and seas; and the\nearth, bare of verdure and destitute of moisture, alone remains, resembling in\nappearance the back of a tortoise. The destroyer of all things, Hari, in the\nform of Rudra, who is the flame of time, becomes the scorching breath of the\nserpent Sesha, and thereby reduces P\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81la to ashes. The great fire, when it\nhas burnt all the divisions of P\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81la, proceeds to the earth and consumes it\nalso. A vast whirlpool of eddying flame then spreads to the region of the\natmosphere and the sphere of the gods, and wraps them in ruin. The three\nspheres show like a frying-pan amidst the surrounding flames, that prey upon\nall movable or stationary things. The inhabitants of the two upper spheres,\nhaving discharged their functions, and being annoyed by the heat, remove to\nthe sphere above, or Maharloka. When that becomes heated, its tenants, who\nafter the full period of their stay, are desirous of ascending to higher\nregions, depart for the Janaloka." *\n\nThe "V\xc4\x81yu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0 gives more explicit teaching on this subject.\n\n"Those sainted mortals who have diligently worshipped Vishnu and are\ndistinguished for piety, abide at the time of dissolution in Maharloka, with\nthe Pitris, the Manus, the seven Rishis, the various orders of celestial\nspirits and the gods. These, when the heat of the flames that destroy the\nworld reaches to Maharloka, repair to Janaloka in their subtle forms, destined\nto become re-embodied in similar capacities as their former, when the world is\nrenewed, at the beginning of the succeeding Kalpa. This continues throughout\nthe life of Brahm\xc4\x81; at the expiration of his life all are destroyed; but those\nwho have then attained a residence in the Brahmaloka,\n\np. 357\n\nby having identified themselves in spirit with the Supreme, are finally\nresolved into the sole existing Brahma."\n\nThe "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" * continues as follows: "Jan\xc4\x81rddana, in the person of\nRudra, having consumed the whole world, breathes forth heavy clouds. Mighty in\nsize, and loud in thunder, they fill all space. Showering down torrents of\nwater, these clouds quench the dreadful fires which involve the three worlds,\nand then they rain uninterruptedly for a hundred years and deluge the whole\nworld. Pouring down in drops as large as dice, these rains overspread the\nearth, and fill the middle region and inundate heaven. The world is now\nenveloped in darkness, and all things, animate and inanimate, having perished,\nthe clouds continue to pour down their waters for more than a hundred years."\n\nThe four Yugas mentioned above--viz. the Krita, Tret\xc4\x81, Dv\xc4\x81para, and K\xc4\x81li--have\ncharacteristic qualities. The Krita is the golden, and K\xc4\x81li the iron age. The\nMah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata \xe2\x80\xa0 gives these characteristics very distinctly. Hanum\xc4\x81n, the\nmonkey-god, is the speaker, describing the four ages to Bh\xc4\xabmasena, one of the\nPandus.\n\n"The Krita is that age in which righteousness is eternal. In the time of that\nmost excellent of Yugas (everything) had been done ( _Krita_ ), and nothing\n(remained) to be done. Duties did not then languish, nor did the people\ndecline. Afterwards through (the influence of) time, this Yuga fell into a\nstate of inferiority. In that age there were neither gods, D\xc4\x81navas,\nGandharvas, Y\xc4\x81kshasas, R\xc4\x81kshasas, nor Pannagas; no buying and selling went on,\nno efforts were made by men; the fruit (of the earth was obtained) by their\nmere wish; righteousness and abandonment of the world (prevailed).\n\np. 358\n\n[paragraph continues] No disease or decline of the organs of sense arose\nthrough the influence of age; there was no malice, weeping, pride, or deceit;\nno contention, no hatred, cruelty, fear, affliction, jealousy, or envy. Hence\nthe Supreme Brahma was the transcendent resort of these Yogins. Then N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana,\nthe soul of all beings, was white. In that age were born creatures devoted to\ntheir duties. They were alike in the object of their trust, in observance, and\nin their knowledge. At that period the castes, alike in their functions,\nfulfilled their duties, were unceasingly devoted to one deity, and used one\nformula (mantra), one rule, and one rite. They had but one Veda.\n\n"Understand now the Tret\xc4\x81, in which sacrifice commenced, righteousness\ndecreased by a fourth, Vishnu became red; and men adhered to truth, and were\ndevoted to a righteousness dependent on ceremonies. Then sacrifices prevailed,\nwith holy arts and a variety of rites. In the Tret\xc4\x81 men acted with an object\nin view, seeking after reward for their rites and their gifts, and no longer\ndisposed to austerities, and to liberality from (a simple feeling of) duty. In\nthis age, however, they were devoted to their own duties and to religious\nceremonies.\n\n"In the Dv\xc4\x81para age righteousness was diminished by two quarters, Vishnu\nbecame yellow, and the Veda fourfold. Some studied four Vedas, some three,\nothers two, and some none at all. The scriptures being thus divided,\nceremonies were celebrated in a great variety of ways; and the people, being:\noccupied with austerity and the bestowal of gifts, became full of passion ( _r\n\xc4\x81jas\xc4\xab_). Owing to ignorance of the one Veda, Vedas were multiplied. And now\nfrom the decline of goodness ( _Sattva_ ), few only adhered to truth. When men\nhad fallen away from goodness, many diseases, desires, and calamities, caused\nby destiny, assailed them, by which they were\n\np. 359\n\nseverely afflicted, and driven to, practise austerities. Others, desiring\nenjoyments and heavenly bliss, offered sacrifices. Thus, when they had reached\nthe Dv\xc4\x81para, men declined through unrighteousness.\n\n"In the K\xc4\x81li, righteousness remained to the extent of one-fourth only. Arrived\nin that age of darkness, Vishnu became black; practices enjoined by the Vedas,\nworks of righteousness, and rites of sacrifices ceased. Calamities, diseases,\nfatigue, faults, such as anger, etc., distresses, anxiety, hunger, fear,\nprevailed. As the ages revolve, righteousness again declines; when this takes\nplace, the people also decline. When they decay, the impulses which actuate\nthem also decay. The practices generated by this declension of the Yugas\nfrustrate men\'s aims. Such is the K\xc4\x81li Yuga, which has existed for a short\ntime. Those who are long-lived act in conformity with the character of the\nage." In the "Bhishmaparvan" there is a paragraph in which it is said that\n"Four thousand years are specified as the duration of life in the Krita Yuga,\nthree thousand in the Tret\xc4\x81, and two thousand form the period at present\nestablished on earth in the Dv\xc4\x81para. There is no fixed measure in the Tishya\n(Kali)." *\n\nIt should be noticed that the immense duration of the ages as quoted above\nfrom the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" is peculiar to the Pur\xc4\x81nas. In the text of the\nMah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata "no mention is made of the years comprising the different Yugas\nbeing _divine years_ ," \xe2\x80\xa0 though the earlier books certainly favour far more\nextravagant notions of chronology than those which Western nations accept.\n\nIt is interesting to notice that in the account of the Krita Yuga, or Age of\nRighteousness, it is said that the castes were alike in their functions. This\nmust evidently\n\np. 360\n\nmean that the modern caste distinctions did not then exist, and that all were\ndevoted to the worship of one deity with one rule and one rite, evidently\npointing to the time when their forefathers were monotheists. And in the\njudgment of the writer this happy condition was in the age of which the\nprevailing characteristic was righteousness.\n\n![](img/36000.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[353:*](hmvp37.htm#fr_312) See "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," book i. chap. iii., and book\nvi. chap. i.\n\n[355:*](hmvp37.htm#fr_313) Muir, O.
