When a son has been born, (the father) should, before other people touch\nhim, give him to eat from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden\nspoon) butter and honey with which he has ground gold(-dust), with (the\nverse), 'I administer to thee the wisdom ('veda') of honey, of ghee, raised by\nSavit _ri_ the bountiful. Long-living, protected by the gods, live a hundred\nautumns in this world!'\n\n2\\. Approaching (his mouth) to (the child's) two ears he murmurs the\n'production of intelligence:' 'Intelligence may give to thee god Savit _ri_ ,\nintelligence may goddess Sarasvati, intelligence may give to thee the two\ndivine A _s_ vins, wreathed with lotus.'\n\n3 3. He touches (the child's) two shoulders with (the verse), 'Be a stone, be\nan axe, be insuperable gold. Thou indeed art the Veda, called son; so live a\nhundred autumns'\xc2\x97and with (the verses), 'Indra, give the best treasures' (Rig-\nveda II, 21, 6), Bestow on us, O bountiful one, O speedy one' (Rig-veda III,\n36, 10).\n\n4\\. And let them give him a name beginning with\n\np. 183\n\na sonant, with a semivowel in it, with the Visarga at its end, consisting of\ntwo syllables,\n\n5\\. Or of four syllables;\n\n6\\. Of two syllables, if he is desirous of firm position; of four syllables,\nif he is desirous of holy lustre;\n\n7\\. But in every case with an even number (of syllables) for men, an uneven\nfor women.\n\n8\\. And let him also find out (for the child) a name to be used at respectful\nsalutations (such as that due to the \xc3\x82 _k_ arya at the ceremony of the\ninitiation); that his mother and his father (alone) should know till his\ninitiation.\n\n9\\. When he returns from a journey, he embraces his son's head and murmurs,\n'From limb by limb thou art produced; out of the heart thou art born. Thou\nindeed art the self called son; so live a hundred autumns!'\xc2\x97(thus) he kisses\nhim three times on his head.\n\n10\\. The rite only (without the Mantra is performed) for a girl.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[182:1](sbe29114.htm#fr_442) 15, 1. Comp. \xc3\x82 _s_ v.-G _ri_ hya-Pari _s_ ish _t_\na I, 26.
