I have been at my book all the\nmorning.\n\nYou say it is only twelve o'clock. Suppose it isn't any later; can't you ever\nthink it is afternoon when it is only twelve o'clock?\n\nI can easily imagine now that the sun has reached the edge of that rice-field,\nand the old fisher-woman is gathering herbs for her supper by the side of the\npond.\n\nI can just shut my eyes and think that the shadows are growing darker under\nthe _madar_ tree, and the water in the pond looks shiny black.\n\nIf twelve o'clock can come in the night, why can't the night come when it is\ntwelve o'clock?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Authorship](cm31.htm)\n\n"
