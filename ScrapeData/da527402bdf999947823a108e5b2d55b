By light, food not being (mentioned in the text) of some.\n\nIn the text of some, viz. the Ka _n_ vas, where food is not mentioned, the\nfive-people are recognised to be the five senses, owing to the phrase 'of\nlights' which is met with in another complementary passage. In the mantra,\n'him the gods worship as the light of lights,' which precedes the mantra about\nthe 'five-people,' Brahman is spoken of as the light of lights, and this\nsuggests the idea of certain lights the activity of which depends on Brahman.\nThe mantra leaves it undetermined what these lights are; but from what follows\nabout the 'five-people,' &c., we learn that what is meant are the senses which\nlight up as it were their respective objects. In 'the breath of breath' the\nsecond 'breath' (in the genitive case) denotes the sense-organ of touch, as\nthat organ is connected with air, and as the vital breath (which would\notherwise suggest itself as the most obvious explanation of pra _n_ a) does\nnot harmonise with the metaphorical term 'light.' 'Of the eye' refers to the\norgan of sight; 'of the ear' to the organ of hearing. 'Of food' comprises the\nsenses of smell and taste together: it denotes the sense of smell on the\nground that that sense is connected with earth, which may be 'food,'\n\np. 374\n\nand the sense of taste in so far as 'anna' may be also explained as that by\nmeans of which eating goes on (adyate). 'Of mind' denotes mind, i. e. the so-\ncalled internal organ. Taste and smell thus being taken in combination, we\nhave the required number of five, and we thus explain the 'five-people' as the\nsense-organs which throw light on their objects, together with the internal\norgan, i.e. mind. The meaning of the clause about the 'five-people' therefore\nis that the senses--called 'five-people'--and the elements, represented by the\nEther, have their basis in Brahman; and as thus all beings are declared to\nabide in Brahman, the five 'five-people' can in no way be the twenty-five\ncategories assumed by the Sa _n_ khyas.--The general Conclusion is that the\nVedanta-texts, whether referring to numbers or not, nowhere set forth the\ncategories established in Kapila's system.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 14.
