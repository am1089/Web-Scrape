Charm for the removal of evil characteristics, and the\nacquisition of auspicious ones.\n\n1\\. Fly forth from here, O evil mark, vanish from here, fly forth to yonder\nplace! Upon him that hates us do we fasten thee with a brazen hook.  \n2\\. The unsavoury mark which flying has alighted upon me, as a creeper upon a\ntree, that mayest thou put away from us, away from here, O golden-handed  \n(golden-rayed) Savitar (the sun), bestowing goods upon us!  \n3\\. Together with the body of the mortal, from his birth, one and a hundred\nmarks are born. Those that are most foul do we drive away from here; the\nauspicious ones, O Gatavedas (Agni), do thou hold fast for us!  \n4\\. These (marks) here I have separated, as cows scattered upon the heather.\nThe pure marks shall remain, the foul ones I have made to disappear!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 18.
