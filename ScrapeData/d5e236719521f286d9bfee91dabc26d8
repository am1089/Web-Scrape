And the promotion (of knowledge is bestowed on them) through special\nacts.\n\nAlso for widowers, &c., the favour of knowledge is possible through special\nacts of duty, such as praying, fasting, propitiation of divinities, &c., which\nare not opposed to their a _s_ rama-less condition and may be performed by any\nman as such. Thus Sm _ri_ ti says, 'By mere prayer no doubt the Brahma _n_ a\nperfects himself. May he perform other works or not, the kindhearted one is\ncalled Brahma _n_ a (Manu Sa _m_ h. II, 87), which passage shows that where\nthe works of the a _s_ ramas are not possible prayer qualifies for knowledge.\nMoreover knowledge may be promoted by a _s_ rama works performed in previous\nbirths. Thus Sm _ri_ ti also declares, 'Perfected by many births he finally\ngoes the highest way' (Bha. Gita VI, 45); which passage shows that the\naggregate of the different purificatory ceremonies performed in former births\npromotes knowledge.--Moreover knowledge--as having a seen result (viz. the\nremoval of ignorance)--qualifies any one who is desirous of it for learning\nand so on, through the mere absence of obstacles 1. Hence there is no\ncontradiction in admitting qualification for knowledge on the part of widowers\nand the like.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[316:1](sbe38247.htm#fr_201) I.e. any one who wishes to learn may do so, if\nonly there is no obstacle in the way.
