There is the injunction of something else cooperating (towards knowledge)\n(which is) a third thing (with regard to balya and pa _n_ _d_ itya), (which\ninjunction is given) for the case (of perfect knowledge not yet having arisen)\nto him who is such (i.e. the Sa _m_ nyasin possessing knowledge); as in the\ncase of injunctions and the like.\n\n'Therefore let a Brahma _n_ a after he has done with learning wish to stand by\na childlike state; and after he has done with the childlike state and learning\n(he is, or, may be) a Muni; and after he has done with what constitutes\nMuniship and non-Muniship (he is, or, may be) a Brahma _n_ a' (B _ri_. Up.\nIII, 5). With reference to this passage a doubt arises whether it enjoins the\nstate of a Muni or not.--The purvapakshin maintains that it does not enjoin\nit, since the injunction is completed with the clause, 'Let him wish to stand\nby a childlike state.' The following clause 'then a Muni' contains no verbal\nform of injunctive force and therefore must be viewed as a mere anuvada\n(making a remark concerning the state of a Muni which is already established).\nShould it be asked how this conclusion is reached, we reply that Muniship is\nestablished by the clause 'having done with learning' (which forms part of the\ninjunctive portion of the passage), as 'Muni' and 'learned man' both denote\nknowledge 1. It is, moreover, clear also that the last clause,' and after he\nhas done with what constitutes Muniship and non-Muniship (he is) a Brahma _n_\na,' does not enjoin the condition of a Brahma _n_ a, as that state is\npreviously established (independently of that clause); but the words 'then a\nBrahma _n_ a' are a mere glorificatory anuvada. Now as the words 'then a Muni'\nshow an analogous form of enunciation (to the clause 'then a Brahma _n_ a'),\nthey also can embody a glorificatory anuvada only.\n\np. 323\n\nTo all this we reply as follows. 'There is an injunction of something else\nwhich co-operates.' The passage must be understood as enjoining the state of a\nMuni--which co-operates towards knowledge--in the same way as it enjoins\nlearning and a childlike state, because that state is something new (not\nenjoined before).--But it has been said above that the word 'learning' already\nintimates Muniship!--This, we reply, does not invalidate our case since the\nword 'muni' denotes (not only knowledge as the term 'learned man' does, but)\npre-eminence of knowledge, on the ground as well of its etymology from\n'manana,' i.e. thinking, as of common use, shown in such phrases as 'I am the\nVyasa of Munis also.'--But the term 'Muni' is also seen to denote the last\norder of life; cp. passages such as 'Householdership, studentship, the order\nof Munis, the order of hermits in the woods.'--Yes, but it has not that\nmeaning exclusively, as we see that it does not apply to phrases such as\n'Valmiki is the foremost among Munis.' In the passage quoted (about the four\norders) the last order is referred to, by the term 'Muni,' because there it\nstands in proximity to the other orders of life, and, as the state of the\nAscetic is the only one which remains (after we have assigned the three other\nterms to the stages of life clearly denoted by them), the last order may be\ndenoted 'mauna' because knowledge is its principal requirement.--We therefore\nconclude that in the passage under discussion the state of the Muni--whose\ncharacteristic mark is pre-eminence of knowledge--is enjoined as something\nthird--with regard to the childlike state and learning.--Against the objection\nthat the injunction terminates with the childlike state, we remark that all\nthe same we must view the Muniship also as something enjoined, as it is\nsomething new, so that we have to supplement the clause as follows: 'then _he\nis to be_ a Muni.' That the state of a Muni is something to be enjoined, in\nthe same way as the childlike state and 'earning, also follows from its being\nreferred to as something to be done with (like balya and pa _n_ _d_ itya. It\nis enjoined 'on him who is such,' i.e. on the Sa _m_ nyasin possessing\nknowledge.--How do we know this latter point?--Because\n\np. 324\n\nthe Sa _m_ nyasin who possesses knowledge forms the topic, as we see from the\npreceding passage, 'Having cognized the Self and risen above the desire for\nsons, &c., they wander about as mendicants.'--But if the Sa _m_ nyasin\npossesses knowledge, pre-eminence of knowledge is already established thereby;\nwhat then is the use of the injunction of Muniship?--To this the Sutra replies\n'in the case of.' That means: in the case of pre-eminence of knowledge not\nbeing established owing to the prevailing force of the (erroneous) idea of\nmultiplicity; for that case the injunction (of Muniship, i.e. of pre-eminence\nof knowledge) is given. 'As in the case of injunctions and the like.' With\nreference to sacrifices such as are enjoined in the passage, 'He who is\ndesirous of the heavenly world is to offer the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa-\nsacrifice,' the aggregate of subordinate members, such as the establishment of\nthe sacred fires, is enjoined as something helpful; similarly in this text\nwhose topic is knowledge and which therefore does not chiefly aim at\ninjunction, Muniship is enjoined as something helpful to knowledge.\n\nAs thus the order of the ascetic, as distinguished by a childlike state and so\non, is actually established by scripture, for what reason does the _Kh_\nandogya Upanishad wind up with the householder, viz. in the passage, 'After\nhaving received his discharge from his teacher he settles in his own house,'\n&c.? For by concluding with the householder, scripture manifests special\nregard for him.--To this doubt the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[322:1](sbe38256.htm#fr_203) The state of a Muni is already enjoined by the\nclause 'pa _n_ _d_ itya _m_ nirvidya;' the clause 'atha muni _h_ ,' therefore,\nmay be viewed as an anuvada (as which it could not be viewed, if there were no\nprevious injunction of mauna).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 48](sbe38257.htm)\n\n"
