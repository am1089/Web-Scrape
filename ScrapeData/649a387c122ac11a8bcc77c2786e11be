BHRIGU.\n\n"WHEN Brahm\xc4\x81 wished to populate the world, he created mind-born sons, like\nhimself; viz. Bhrigu, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Angiras, Marichi, Daksha, Atri,\nand Vasishtha: these are the nine Brahm\xc4\x81s or Brahm\xc4\x81rishis celebrated in the\nPur\xc4\x81nas." * Originally seven only were mentioned in the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata; but the\nlists found in different parts of that Epic do not agree with each other.\nThese seven are supposed to be visible in the Great Bear, as their wives shine\nin the Pleiades. These Brahm\xc4\x81rishis are also called Praj\xc4\x81patis (lords of\noffspring), Brahm\xc4\x81putras (sons of Brahm\xc4\x81), and Br\xc4\x81hmanas. The "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na"\nteaches that Bhrigu married his niece Khy\xc4\x81ti, a daughter of Daksha, who bore\nto him Sri or Lakshmi; but as it was the common belief that she was one of the\nproducts of the churning of the ocean, the reciter of the Pur\xc4\x81na is asked to\nexplain this discrepancy. The substance of his answer was, that\n\np. 364\n\n[paragraph continues] "of gods, animals, and man, Hari is all that is called\nmale, Lakshmi is all that is termed female."\n\nIn his account of the creation, Manu mentions ten Maharishis as having been\ncreated by himself, one of whom is Bhrigu, who in his turn created seven other\nManus, from whom all that is has sprung. * The Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata says: "Six great\nRishis are known as the mind-born sons of Brahm\xc4\x81;" but Bhrigu is not named\namongst them. In another passage it describes him as a son of Varuna, but\nBrahm\xc4\x81 is there identified with Varuna. At a sacrifice at which Brahm\xc4\x81\nofficiated, a portion of Varuna was thrown into the sacrificial fire, whence\nthere arose three men endowed with bodies. Bhrigu sprang first from _bhrik_\n(the blazing of the fire), Angiras from the cinders, and Kavi from a heap of\nashes. The god called Mah\xc4\x81deva, Varuna, and Pavana, claimed these three as his\nown. Agni and Brahm\xc4\x81 also claimed them. \xe2\x80\xa0 It was agreed that Bhrigu was\nVaruna\'s son. Agni received Angiras, and Brahm\xc4\x81 took Kavi. In another part of\nthat poem it is said, "We have heard that the great and venerable Rishi Bhrigu\nwas produced by Brahm\xc4\x81 from fire at the sacrifice of Varuna." \xe2\x80\xa1 The "Bh\xc4\x81gavata\nPur\xc4\x81na" says that "he sprang from the skin of the Creator;" and the\nMah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, in another verse, declares that "the venerable Bhrigu, having\nsplit Brahm\xc4\x81\'s heart, issued forth."\n\nAt the great sacrifice of Daksha, to which Siva was not invited, Bhrigu\nofficiated as priest; and because he reviled that god and his followers, and\njustified Daksha in slighting him, he suffered the loss of his beard.\n\nThe Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata gives a legend of Bhrigu cursing Indra. The Indra of that age,\nnamed Nahusha, being\n\np. 365\n\nfilled with pride, lost the benefit of his previous good works, and in his\npresumption caused the Rishis to carry him about. When it came to Agastya\'s\nturn to carry him, Bhrigu said to him, "Why do we submit to the insults of\nthis wicked king of the gods?" Agastya replied that none of the Rishis had\ncursed Nahusha, because he had received as a boon the power to subject to his\nservice any on whom he fixed his eye; but that at the same time he was quite\nready to act upon any suggestion Bhrigu might make. Bhrigu then told him that\nhe had been sent by Brahm\xc4\x81 to take vengeance on Nahusha, who would that very\nday attach Agastya to his car and kick him; but incensed at this insult, he\n(Bhrigu) would by a curse condemn the oppressor to become a serpent.\n\nThe mighty Nahusha summoned Agastya from the banks of the Sarasvati to carry\nhim. The glorious Bhrigu then said to Maitr\xc4\x81varum (Agastya), "Close thy eyes,\nwhilst I enter into the knot of thy hair!" With the view of overthrowing the\nking, Bhrigu hid himself in the hair of Agastya, who then stood motionless as\na stock. Nahusha came to Agastya, when the sage desired to be attached to the\nvehicle, and agreed to carry the king of the gods wherever he pleased. Nahusha\nattached him, but Bhrigu did not venture to look at him, knowing his power of\nsubduing by a glance. Agastya kept his temper; even when urged by a goad, he\nremained unmoved. The king at last kicked him; then Bhrigu, invisible in the\nhair of Agastya, became enraged, and violently cursed him: "Since, fool, thou\nhast in thine anger smitten the great Muni on the head with thy foot,\ntherefore become a serpent, and fall swiftly to the earth." * Thus cursed,\nNahusha fell to\n\np. 366\n\nthe earth; had the sage been seen by Indra, he would have been unable to\npunish the oppressor.\n\nBhrigu on another occasion cursed Agni. The Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata says:--A woman named\nPulom\xc4\x81 was betrothed to a demon; Bhrigu, seeing her beauty, married her\naccording to Vedic rites, and carried her off secretly. The demon, by the aid\nof Agni, discovered the bride\'s hiding-place, and took her away to his home.\nFor rendering the demon this assistance, Bhrigu, cursing Agni, said, "From\nthis day, you shall eat everything." Agni asked Bhrigu why he had cursed him,\nseeing that by speaking the truth he had simply done his duty; and reminded\nhim that "when a person is asked a question, and intentionally speaks what is\nfalse, he, with seven preceding and seven succeeding generations, is cast into\nhell; and that he who withholds information is equally guilty." He goes on to\nsay, "I, too, can curse, but respecting Br\xc4\x81hmans restrain my anger. I am\nreally the mouth of the gods and ancestors. When gh\xc4\xab is offered to them, they\npartake of it through me as their mouth; how then can I be said to eat\neverything?" Bhrigu hearing this consented to modify his curse, by saying\nthat, "as the Sun by his light and heat purifies all nature, so Agni should\npurify all that passed through him."\n\nBhrigu is said to have performed a most wonderful deed; the transforming of a\nKshattriya king into a Br\xc4\x81hman. The Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata * gives the following account\nof this unique work:--"Divod\xc4\x81sa, King of K\xc4\x81si (Benares), was attacked by the\nsons of Vit\xc4\x81havya, and all his family slain in battle. The afflicted monarch\ntherefore resorted to the sage Bharadv\xc4\x81ja, who performed for him a sacrifice,\nin consequence of which a son named\n\np. 367\n\n[paragraph continues] Pratardana was born to him. Pratardana, becoming an\naccomplished warrior, was sent by his father to take vengeance on the\nVit\xc4\x81havyas. Vit\xc4\x81havya had now to fly to another sage, Bhrigu, who promised his\nprotection. The avenger Pratardana, however, followed, and demanded that the\nrefugee should be given up. Bhrigu, the most eminent of religious men, filled\nwith compassion, said, \'There is no Kshattriya here; all these are Br\xc4\x81hmans.\'\nHearing this true assertion of Bhrigu, Pratardana was glad, and, gently\ntouching the sage\'s feet, rejoined, \'Even thus, O glorious saint, I have\ngained my object, for I have compelled this king to relinquish his caste.\'\nThis Vit\xc4\x81havya, by the mere word of Bhrigu, became a Br\xc4\x81hman Rishi, and an\nutterer of the Vedas."\n\nThe names of nineteen Bhrigus are given in the "Matsya Pur\xc4\x81na," who are said\nto be composers of hymns; Bhrigu himself being one of the narrators of the\nMah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata. Professor Roth * speaks of the Bhrigus as a class of mythological\nbeings, who belonged to the aerial or middle class of gods. They were the\ndiscoverers of fire, and then brought it to men. He adds that the race has a\nconnection with history, as one of the chief Br\xc4\x81hmanical families bears the\nname, and allusions are made to the fact in the hymns of the Rig-Veda.\n\nIn the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana there are not many references to Bhrigu; he is there called a\nMaharishi; and R\xc4\x81ma is induced to slay a female demon by the remembrance that\nVishnu slew Brigu\'s wife when she aspired to Indra\'s throne. He is the saint\nwhom the childless wives of S\xc4\x81gar worshipped in order to obtain a son; and he\ngave to one lady one, to the other sixty thousand. Parasur\xc4\x81ma was one of his\nmost illustrious descendants.\n\np. 368\n\n##### 2\\. PULASTYA.\n\nPulastya, another of Brahm\xc4\x81\'s mind-born sons, is reverenced because it was\nthrough him that the Pur\xc4\x81nas were made known to men. The reason of his being\nregarded as the Revealer of Scripture is taught in the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," *\nwhere the narrator Par\xc4\x81sara, in answer to a question of his disciple Maitreya,\nsays: "You recall to my mind what was of old narrated by my father\'s father,\nVasishtha. I had heard that my father had been devoured by a R\xc4\x81kshas, employed\nby Visvamitra: violent anger seized me, and I commenced a sacrifice for the\ndestruction of the R\xc4\x81kshasas; hundreds of them were reduced to ashes by the\nrite, when, as they were about to be entirely extirpated, my grandfather\nVasishtha thus spake to me: \'Enough, my child; let thy wrath be appeased; the\nR\xc4\x81kshasas are not culpable: thy father\'s death was the work of destiny.\'"\n\nPar\xc4\x81sara ceased from his sacrifice, and his grandfather was pleased; then\nPulastya coming said to him: "Since, in the violence of animosity, you have\nlistened to the words of your progenitor, and exercised clemency, you shall\nbecome learned in every science. Since you have forborne, even though\nincensed, to destroy my posterity, I will bestow on you another boon; you\nshall become the author of a summary of the Pur\xc4\x81nas, shall know the true\nnature of the deities, and your understanding through my favour shall be\nperfect and free from doubts." Par\xc4\x81sara relates the Pur\xc4\x81na as told him\nformerly "by Vasishtha and the wise Pulastya."\n\nPulastya married Prithi, a daughter of Daksha, by whom he had a son, the sage\nAgastya; the Bh\xc4\x81gavata\n\np. 369\n\ncalls his wife Havisbhu, whose sons were Agastya and Visravas, the father of\nKuvera, R\xc4\x81vana, and other R\xc4\x81kshasas.\n\nThe reason of Par\xc4\x81sara\'s attack upon the R\xc4\x81kshasas is given in a legend in the\nMah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata. King Kalm\xc4\x81shapada, meeting with Sakti (Par\xc4\x81sara\'s father) in a\nnarrow path in a forest, wished him to get out of his way. This the sage\nrefused to do; whereupon the king thrashed him with his whip; in return Sakti\ncursed him, and he became a cannibal R\xc4\x81kshas. When in this form, the king\nkilled and ate Sakti and all the other sons of Vasishtha. Sakti\'s wife being\npregnant at the time of his death, Par\xc4\x81sara was born soon after and brought up\nwith his grandfather. When he grew up, he commenced the slaughter of the\nR\xc4\x81kshasas, but was restrained by Vasishtha, Pulastya, and others.\n\n##### 3\\. PULAHA.\n\nThis Rishi does not figure largely in Hindu mythology. He married a daughter\nof Daksha named Ksham\xc4\x81 (Patience), by whom he had three sons.\n\n##### 4\\. KRATU.\n\nKratu is no more widely known than Pulaha. He married Sannati (Humility),\nanother daughter of Daksha, by whom he had "sixty thousand B\xc4\x81lakhilyas, pigmy\nsages no bigger than the joint of the thumb; chaste, pious, and resplendent as\nthe rays of the sun." *\n\n##### 5\\. ANGIRAS.\n\nAngiras is famed as the author of several hymns of Rig-Veda. He first married\nSmriti (Memory), by\n\np. 370\n\nwhom he had four daughters, and afterwards he married Swaddha (Oblation) and\nSati, also Daksha\'s daughters. His so-called daughters, the Pratyangirasa\nBichas, are thirty-five verses addressed to presiding divinities. There is\nsome ambiguity in the use of his name; it comes from the same root as Agni, of\nwhich deity it is used as an epithet; it is also used of Agni\'s father, and is\nthe name of a son of Agneya, Agni\'s daughter. Angiras is supposed to have been\nassociated with Bhrigu in introducing fire-worship into India.\n\n##### 6\\. MARICHI.\n\nMarichi is better known through his descendants than from any work of his own,\nhis most illustrious child being Kasyapa, as a son of whom Vishnu came, in his\nincarnation as a dwarf. Amongst Kasyapa\'s thirteen wives were Diti and Aditi,\nwho by him became the mothers of gods. "There were twelve celebrated deities\nin a former age called Tushitas, who, on the approach of the present period,\nor during the reign of the last Manu Chakshusa, said amongst themselves,\n\'Come, let us quickly enter into the womb of Aditi, that we may be born in the\nnext Manvantara, for thereby we shall again enjoy the rank of gods.\nAccordingly they were born the sons of Kasyapa, the son of Marichi by Aditi;\nthence named the twelve \xc4\x80dityas, whose names were Vishnu, Sakra, Aryaman,\nDhuti, Tvastri, Pushan, Vivasvat, Savitri, Mitra, Varuna, Ansa, and Bhaga." *\n\nAn explanation of the fact that gods undergo successive births is found in the\n"V\xc4\x81yu Pur\xc4\x81na." In the beginning of the Kalpa, twelve gods, named Jayas, were\ncreated by Brahm\xc4\x81 as his deputies and assistants in\n\np. 371\n\ncreation. They, lost in meditation, neglected his commands, on which he\ndeclared that they should be reborn in each Manvantara until the seventh. *\nThe writer of the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" tries to explain this fact: "These classes\nof divinities are born again at the end of a thousand ages according to their\nown pleasure, and their appearance and disappearance are spoken of as a birth\nand death; but they exist age after age in the same manner as the sun sets and\nrises again."\n\nBy his wife Diti, Kasyapa had two sons, Hiranyakasipu and Hirany\xc4\x81ksha, whom\nVishnu, here said to be the son of her sister Aditi; became incarnate to\ndestroy; these mortal enemies were therefore cousins.\n\n##### 7\\. ATRI.\n\nAtri was the author of many Vedic hymns, especially those "praising Agni,\nIndra, the Asvins, and the Viswadevas." He married Anas\xc5\xaby\xc4\x81, who bore him\nDurv\xc4\x81sas, the sage who was slighted by Indra. Soma, the moon, is said to\nproceed from the eyes of his father Atri.\n\nWhen this sage and his wife were old, they received a visit at their hermitage\nfrom R\xc4\x81ma, Sita, and Lakshman, who were then wandering from place to place--\n\n"He came to Atri\'s pure retreat,  \n Paid reverence to his holy feet,  \n And from the saint such welcome won  \n As a fond father gives his son." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nAtri, in introducing his wife to his illustrious guests, thus describes her--\n\n"Ten thousand years this votaress, bent  \n On sternest rites of penance, spent;\n\np. 372\n\n[paragraph continues]  She, when the clouds withheld their rain,  \n And drought ten years consumed the plain,  \n Caused grateful roots and fruits to grow  \n And ordered Gang\xc4\x81 here to flow;  \n So from their cares the saints she freed,  \n Nor let these checks their rites impede.  \n She wrought in heaven\'s behalf, and made  \n Ten nights of one, the gods to aid." *\n\nAnas\xc5\xaby\xc4\x81 then joins with her husband in welcoming the exiles to their\nhermitage, and, delighted with the princess, tells her to ask a boon. As,\nhowever, Sit\xc4\x81 appeared to want nothing particular, the aged saint said--\n\n                  "My gift to-day  \n Thy sweet contentment shall repay:  \n Accept this precious robe to wear,  \n Of heavenly fabric, rich and rare;  \n These gems thy limbs to ornament,  \n This precious balsam sweet of scent.  \n O Maithil dame! this gift of mine  \n Shall make thy limbs with beauty shine,  \n And, breathing o\'er thy frame, dispense  \n Its pure and lasting influence.  \n This balsam, on thy fair limbs spread,  \n New radiance on thy lord shall shed,  \n As Lakshmi\'s beauty lends a grace  \n To Vishnu\'s own celestial face." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\n##### 8\\. DAKSHA.\n\nDaksha, the father of Um\xc4\x81, the consort of Siva, has attained pre-eminence\namongst his brethren largely through the greatness of his son-in-law. He, too,\nis a mind-born son of Brahm\xc4\x81; or, according to other accounts, sprang from the\nthumb of his father. He is\n\np. 373\n\none of the chief Praj\xc4\x81patis. Before speaking of Daksha, as the term Praj\xc4\x81pati\nis of frequent occurrence, it will not be out of place here to describe the\nposition of these beings.\n\nThe term Praj\xc4\x81pati means a lord of creatures; the Praj\xc4\x81patis, therefore, are\nregarded as the progenitors of mankind. The word is used in much the same\nmanner\n\n[![DAKSHA.](tn/37300.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/37300.jpg)  \nDAKSHA.  \n\nas Patriarch in the Christian Scriptures. Sometimes Brahm\xc4\x81 alone is intended\nby the term Praj\xc4\x81pati; he is _the_ "lord of creatures;" sometimes it is\nemployed for the first-formed men from whom the human race sprang. The word\nwas originally employed as an epithet of Savitri and Soma, as well as of\nHirany\xc4\x81garbha, or Brahm\xc4\x81. It afterwards, however, came to denote a separate\ndeity, who appears in three places in the\n\np. 374\n\n[paragraph continues] Rig-Veda. Praj\xc4\x81pati is sometimes identified with the\nuniverse, and described (in the same way as Brahma, or entity, or non-entity\nin other places) as having alone existed in the beginning, as the source out\nof which creation was evolved: " _e.g._ Praj\xc4\x81pati was this universe; Vach was\na second to him. She became pregnant, she departed from him, she produced\nthese creatures. She again entered into Praj\xc4\x81pati." * At the same time he is\n"sometimes described as a secondary or subordinate deity, and treated as one\nof thirty-three deities."\n\nBy the time Manu wrote, creation had come to be regarded as the special work\nof Brahm\xc4\x81, hence the term Praj\xc4\x81pati is applied to him in the Dharmasastra, and\nin the later writings it is given to those who sprang from him, and carried on\nhis work of populating the world.\n\nThe Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata \xe2\x80\xa0 gives two distinct accounts of the origin of\nDaksha:--"Daksha, the glorious Rishi, tranquil in spirit, and great in austere\nfervour, sprang from the right thumb of Brahm\xc4\x81. From the left thumb sprang the\ngreat Muni\'s wife, by whom he begot fifty daughters." "Born with all\nsplendour, like that of the great Rishis, the ten sons of Prachetas (another\nPraj\xc4\x81pati) are reputed to have been virtuous and holy, and by them the\nglorious beings (trees, plants, etc.), were formerly burnt up by fire\nspringing from their mouth. From them was born Daksha Pr\xc4\x81chetasa; and from\nDaksha, the parent of the world, (were produced) these creatures. Cohabiting\nwith Virini, the Muni Daksha begat a thousand sons like himself, famous for\ntheir religious observances." In the Harivansa, Vishnu is identified with\nDaksha. At the end of a thousand Yugas the Br\xc4\x81hmans of a previous age,\n"perfect in knowledge and contemplation, became involved in the\n\np. 375\n\ndissolution of the world. Then. Vishnu, sprung from Brahma, removed beyond the\nsphere of sense, absorbed in contemplation, became the Praj\xc4\x81pati Daksha, and\nformed numerous creatures." *\n\nFuller particulars of Daksha\'s origin we find in the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na." \xe2\x80\xa0 "From\nBrahm\xc4\x81, continuing to meditate, were born mind-engendered progeny, with forms\nand faculties derived from his corporeal nature, embodied spirits produced\nfrom the person of that all-wise deity. But as they did not multiply\nthemselves, Brahm\xc4\x81 created other mind-born sons like himself, viz. Bhrigu,\netc. Considerable variety prevails in this list of Praj\xc4\x81patis, but the\nvariations are of the nature of additions made to an apparently original\nenumeration of but seven, whose names generally occur. The names mentioned in\nall the Pur\xc4\x81nas make up altogether seventeen. The simple statement that the\nfirst Praj\xc4\x81patis sprang from the mind or will of Brahm\xc4\x81 has not contented the\ndepraved taste of the mystics, and in some of the Pur\xc4\x81nas, as the Bh\xc4\x81gavata,\nV\xc4\x81yu and Linga, they are said to be derived from the body of their progenitor;\nBhrigu from his skin, Marichi from his mind, Atri from his eyes, Angiras from\nhis mouth, Pulastya from his ear, Pulaha from his navel, Kratu from his hand,\nVasishtha from his breath, Daksha from his thumb, and N\xc4\x81rada from his lips.\nThey do not exactly agree, however, in the [description of the places] whence\nthese beings proceed." \xe2\x80\xa1\n\nThe "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xc2\xa7 also speaks of Daksha as a son of the Pr\xc4\x81chetasas, and\ngets over the difficulty by the statement that he was born first as a son of\nBrahm\xc4\x81, and afterwards as the son of the Pr\xc4\x81chetasas. These\n\np. 376\n\nprogenitors of Daksha were the sons of a mighty patriarch named\nPrachinaverhis, so called "from his placing upon the earth the sacred grass\npointing to the East." At the termination of a season of rigid penance, he\nmarried Savarn\xc4\x81, the daughter of the ocean, who had by him ten sons, styled\nPr\xc4\x81chetasas, who were skilled in military science; "they all observed the same\nduties, practised religious austerities, and remained immersed in the bed of\nthe sea for ten thousand years." The reason for this prolonged penance was the\nfact that their father had been enjoined by Brahm\xc4\x81 to increase the human\nfamily. In harmony with his promise of obedience, he told his sons that the\nperformance of severe penance was the best way of fulfilling Brahm\xc4\x81\'s order;\n"for whoever worships Vishnu, the bestower of good, attains undoubtedly the\nobject of his desires: there is no other mode."\n\nAs the sons were immersed in the ocean, intent on the worship of Vishnu, that\ndeity appeared to them, and, hearing their request, said, "Receive the boon\nyou have desired; for I, the giver of good, am content with you." Whilst the\nPr\xc4\x81chetasas were absorbed in their devotions, "the trees grew and overshadowed\nthe unprotected earth, the people perished, the winds could not blow, the sky\nwas shut out from view by the boughs, and mankind unable to labour for ten\nthousand years. When the sages saw this, wind (which tore up the trees) and\nflames (which then consumed them) issued from their mouths, and the forests\nwere soon cleared away. Soma, the sovereign of the vegetable world, seeing\nnearly all the trees destroyed, went to the patriarchs and said, Restrain your\nindignation, and listen to me. I will make an alliance between you and the\ntrees. Prescient of futurity, I have nourished this maiden, the daughter\n\np. 377\n\nof the woods. She is called M\xc4\x81rish\xc4\x81, and, as your bride, she shall be the\nmultiplier of the race of Druva. From a portion of your and my lustre the\npatriarch Daksha shall be born, who, endowed with a part of me and composed of\nyour vigour, shall be resplendent as fire, and shall multiply the human\nrace.\'"\n\nSoma then informs the brothers respecting M\xc4\x81rish\xc4\x81\'s origin. "There was\nformerly a sage named Kandu, eminent in wisdom and austerity, on the banks of\nthe Gomati. Indra sent the nymph Pramloch\xc4\x81 to divert the sage from his\ndevotions: they lived together for 150 years, during which time the Muni was\ngiven up to pleasure. The nymph at the close of this period asked leave to\ndepart, but the Muni entreated her to continue with him. And though at the end\nof several centuries she preferred the same request, again and again she was\nasked to remain.\n\n"On one occasion, as the sage was going forth from their cottage in a great\nhurry, the nymph asked where he was going. \'The day,\' he replied, \'is drawing\nfast to a close. I must perform the Sandhya worship, or a duty will be\nneglected.\' The nymph smiled mirthfully as she rejoined, \'Why do you talk,\ngrave sir, of this day drawing to a close; your day is a day of many years, a\nday that must be a marvel to all: explain what this means.\' The Muni said,\n\'Fair maiden, you came to the river-side at dawn. I beheld you then, and you\nentered the hermitage. It is now the revolution of evening, and the day is\ngone. What is the meaning of this laughter? Tell me the truth.\' Pramloch\xc4\x81\nanswered, \'You say rightly, venerable Br\xc4\x81hman, that I carne hither at morning\ndawn, but several hundred years have passed since the time of my arrival. This\nis the truth.\'" She informed him that they had lived\n\np. 378\n\ntogether nine hundred and seven years, six months, and three days. The Muni\nsees now that the nymph must have been sent by Indra purposely to interrupt\nhis devotions, and deprive him of the divine knowledge he had desired. And\nthough very angry with her at first, he bids her depart in peace, as he says,\n"The sin is wholly mine."\n\n"Thus addressed by the Muni, Pramloch\xc4\x81 stood trembling, whilst big drops of\nperspiration started from every pore, till he angrily cried to her, \'Begone,\nbegone!\' She then, reproached by him, went forth from his dwelling, and,\npassing through the air, wiped the perspiration from her person with the\nleaves of the trees. The nymph went from tree to tree, and as with dusky\nshoots that crowned their summits she dried her limbs, which were covered with\nmoisture, the child she had conceived by the Rishi came forth from the pores\nof her skin in drops of perspiration. The trees received the living dews, and\nthe winds collected them into one mass. \'This,\' said Soma, \'I matured by my\nrays, and gradually it increased in size, till the exhalation that had rested\non the tree-tops became the lovely girl named M\xc4\x81rish\xc4\x81. The trees will give her\nto you, Pr\xc4\x81chetasas; let your indignation be appeased. She is the progeny of\nKandu, the child of Pramloch\xc4\x81, the nursling of the trees, the daughter of the\nwind and moon.\'"\n\nSoma then informs the Pr\xc4\x81chetasas that M\xc4\x81rish\xc4\x81, in her previous birth, was the\nwidow of a prince, but left childless. She therefore earnestly worshipped\nVishnu, who told her to desire some boon. She replied, "I pray thee that in\nsucceeding births I may have honourable husbands, and a son equal to a\npatriarch among men, . . . . and may I be born out of the ordinary course."\nVishnu promised her: "In another life you\n\np. 379\n\nshall have ten husbands of mighty prowess, and renowned for glorious acts; and\nyou shall have a son magnanimous and valiant, distinguished by the rank of a\npatriarch, from whom the various races of men shall multiply, and by whose\nposterity the universe shall be filled. You, virtuous lady, shall be of\nmarvellous birth, and delighting the hearts of men." Thus having spoken, the\ndeity disappeared, and Soma informs his hearers that it was this princess who\nwas born as M\xc4\x81rish\xc4\x81.\n\n"Soma having concluded, the Pr\xc4\x81chetasas took M\xc4\x81rish\xc4\x81, as he had enjoined them,\nrighteously to wife, [relinquishing](errata.htm#1) their indignation against\nthe trees, and upon her they begot the eminent patriarch Daksha, who had (in a\nformer life) been born as the son of Brahm\xc4\x81. This great sage, for the\nfurtherance of creation and the increase of mankind, created progeny. Obeying\nthe command of Brahm\xc4\x81, he made movable and immovable things, the bipeds and\nquadrupeds, and subsequently by his will gave birth to females, ten of whom he\nbestowed on Dharma, thirteen on Kasyapa, and twenty-seven, who regulate the\ncourse of time, on Soma (the moon). Of these the gods, the Titans, the snake\ngods, cattle and birds, the singers and dancers of the courts of heaven, the\nspirits of evil and other beings, were born. From that period forward living\ncreatures were engendered in an ordinary manner; before the time of Daksha,\nthey were variously propagated by the will, by sight, by touch, and by the\ninfluence of religious austerities by devout sages and holy saints."\n\nDaksha\'s first attempts at populating the world were unsuccessful. A thousand\nsons were born to him by Asikni, but these were induced by N\xc4\x81rada not to\npropagate offspring. A thousand other sons by the same wife were\n\np. 380\n\nborn, who also were advised by N\xc4\x81rada not to be troubled with children. The\nPraj\xc4\x81pati, incensed, cursed N\xc4\x81rada, and proceeded to create sixty daughters by\nAsikni, whom he gave to various husbands, by whom they had children. At\nlength, when a time of peace and prosperity prevailed on the earth, and the\ngods had their proper places assigned to them, to Daksha was given the\nposition as chief of the Praj\xc4\x81patis--progenitors of mankind.\n\nIn the account of Siva it was noticed that as a punishment for the insults\nDaksha had offered to his illustrious son-in-law, the great god changed his\nhead for that of a goat; a perpetual sign of his ignorance and stupidity.\n\n##### 9\\. VASISHTHA.\n\nVasishtha, together with Pulastya, is said to have narrated the "Vishnu\nPur\xc4\x81na," and he, too, is believed to have been the writer of many of the Vedic\nhymns. It was he who allayed the anger of Par\xc4\x81sara when that sage was about to\nextirpate the R\xc4\x81kshas race, because one of their kings had slain his father.\nHe is said to have been the Vy\xc4\x81sa, or arranger of the Vedas, in the Dv\xc4\x81para\nAge; this work of arranging having a different agent in each age.\n\nVasishtha served as the family priest of several kings. One of these, named\nSaud\xc4\x81sa, when out hunting, seeing a couple of tigers, shot one of them with an\narrow. It happened that these tigers were really R\xc4\x81kshasas, for, as the one\nshot by Saud\xc4\x81sa was dying, it assumed a fiendish shape; the other, threatening\nvengeance, disappeared. Not long after this, as the king was engaged in a\nsacrifice, Vasishtha being out of the room, the R\xc4\x81kshas who escaped, assuming\nthe form of Vasishtha,\n\np. 381\n\ncame to the king and said, "Now that the sacrifice is ended, give me something\nto eat.; let it be cooked, and I will presently return." The R\xc4\x81kshas next\ntransformed himself into the cook, and, having prepared a dish of human flesh,\nbrought it to the king. When the real Muni entered, the king offered him the\ndish; but he discovered, by the force of meditation, that it was human flesh\nthat was presented to him. Indignant at the insult, cursing the king, he said,\n"Your appetite shall be excited by similar food to that now offered me." The\nking was astonished at this outburst of anger, and Vasishtha, seeing this, by\nfurther meditation, discovered the whole trick; but as he could not entirely\nrecall the effects of his curse, he modified it so that it was to work for\ntwelve years only. * It was this same king who was cursed by Vasishtha\'s son\nSakti to become a R\xc4\x81kshas, and who, in that state, devoured the sage that\ncursed him.\n\nVasishtha also cursed a king named Nimi. As the king was about to commence a\nsacrifice that was to continue for a thousand years, he asked Vasishtha to\nofficiate as priest; but the Muni being engaged in a similar work for Indra,\nhe could not do so for the next five hundred years. The king proceeded with\nhis sacrifice, engaging Gautama as priest. As soon as his engagement was over\nwith Indra, the sage, coming to conduct Nimi\'s sacrifice, found another priest\nhad been appointed. He was so angry that, cursing the king, he declared that\nhe should cease to exist in a bodily form. On learning what was done, the king\nin return pronounced a similar curse upon the sage. Both took effect; but as\nVasishtha\'s spirit became united to the spirits of Mitra and Varuna, when\nthese deities were smitten with the beauty of the nymph Urvasi, the\n\np. 382\n\nspirit of the sage fell from them, and he became again incorporated through\nher. * A verse in the Rig-Veda ascribes Vasishtha\'s birth to Mitra and Varuna,\nin harmony with the legend just quoted: "Thou, O Vasishtha, art a son of Mitra\nand Varuna, born a Br\xc4\x81hman from the soul of Urvasi. All the gods placed in the\nvessel thee--the drop which had fallen through divine contemplation."\n\nThere are several stories of quarrels between this sage and Visvamitra, who\nwas anxious to obtain the position of priest to Saud\xc4\x81sa, which was held by\nVasishtha. At another time, when he was priest to Harischandra, he was so\ngreatly incensed at the treatment the king had received at Visvamitra\'s hands\nthat he cursed him, and he became a crane. His rival returned the compliment,\nand he too became a bird. In this form the sages fought so violently that it\nwas necessary for Brahm\xc4\x81 to pacify them. The real cause of all this\nunpleasantness was the fact that Visvamitra was a Kshattriya by birth, who, by\npenance and various rites, had obtained admission into the Br\xc4\x81hmanical caste.\nPrevious to his exaltation he was a king. Being desirous of obtaining a\nwonderful cow that belonged to Vasishtha, which had the power to grant\nwhatever her owner desired, as he could not overcome the Br\xc4\x81hmans, owing to\ntheir superhuman power, he first sought to raise himself to equality with\nthem, and at length his efforts were crowned with success.\n\n##### 10\\. N\xc4\x80RADA.\n\nN\xc4\x81rada\'s name is not found in the list of Brahm\xc4\x81\'s sons in the "Vishnu\nPur\xc4\x81na," yet he is generally regarded\n\np. 383\n\nas one, though, according to some authorities, he had a different origin. He\nis the messenger of the gods, and is often described as imparting information\nthat was only known to them. It was he who persuaded the sons of Daksha not to\nbeget offspring, and who was cursed for his interference; it was he who\ninformed Kansa of the approaching birth of Krishna, which led that king to\nslay the children of Vasudeva: hence his common name is Kalik\xc4\x81raka, the\nstrife-maker, and in modern plays he is introduced as a spy and marplot. The\nname N\xc4\x81rada is frequently employed as a term of abuse. It is used to describe\na quarrelsome, meddling person.\n\n"A distinguished son of Brahm\xc4\x81, named N\xc4\x81rada, whose actions are the subject of\na Pur\xc4\x81na, bears a strong resemblance to Hermes or Mercury. He was a wise\nlegislator, great in arts and arms, an eloquent messenger of the gods, either\nto one another or to favoured mortals, and a musician of exquisite skill. His\ninventing the _vina_ , or Indian lute, is thus described in the poem entitled\n\'M\xc4\x81gha:\' \'N\xc4\x81rada sat watching from time to time his large _vina_ , which, by\nthe impulse of the breeze, yielded notes that pierced successively the regions\nof his ear, and proceeded by musical intervals.\' The Law Tract, supposed to\nhave been revealed by N\xc4\x81rada, is at this hour cited by Pundits, and we cannot\ntherefore believe him to have been the patron of thieves, though an innocent\ntheft of Krishna\'s cattle, by way of putting his divinity to the test, he\nstrangely imputed, in the Bh\xc4\x81gavata Pur\xc4\x81na,\' to his father Brahm\xc4\x81." *\n\nThe accounts of N\xc4\x81rada\'s origin vary considerably. According to the Bh\xc4\x81gavata,\nhe was the third incarnation of Vishnu. Manu declares that he was one of the\nMaharishis whom he created at the beginning of the\n\np. 384\n\nage. Moor * quotes as . follows: "Brahm\xc4\x81 said, \'Rise up, Rudra, and form man\nto govern the world.\' Rudra obeyed; but the men he made were fiercer than\ntigers, having nothing but the destructive quality in their composition. Anger\nwas their only passion. Brahm\xc4\x81, Vishnu, and Rudra then joined their different\npowers, and created ten men whose names were N\xc4\x81rada," etc. The "Siva Pur\xc4\x81na"\nteaches that N\xc4\x81rada sprang from the thigh of his father: "Brahm\xc4\x81, in view of\npeopling the world, produced four beings, who, being refractory, caused their\nparent to weep. To comfort him, Siva, in the character of Rudra, issued from a\nfold in his forehead, with five heads and ten arms, and, endowing Brahm\xc4\x81 with\nadditional might, he (Brahm\xc4\x81) produced Bhrigu and the seven Rishis, and after\nthat N\xc4\x81rada from his thigh." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nIn another birth N\xc4\x81rada was the son of Kasyapa \xe2\x80\xa1 and a daughter of Daksha.\nDaksha was greatly incensed when he dissuaded the Praj\xc4\x81pati\'s sons from\npeopling the world, and declared that he should not have a resting-place;\nhence his wandering nature.\n\nOn one occasion N\xc4\x81rada was cursed by his own father, and he in return cursed\nBrahm\xc4\x81. "Brahm\xc4\x81 exhorted his son N\xc4\x81rada to take a wife, and assist in peopling\nthe world. N\xc4\x81rada, who was a votary of Krishna, becomes angry, affirms that\ndevotion to that god is the sole way to attain felicity, and denounces his\nfather as an erring instructor. Brahm\xc4\x81, in reply, curses N\xc4\x81rada, and dooms him\nto a life of sensuality, and subjection to women. N\xc4\x81rada pays back the\nimprecation as follows: \'Wretch! become no object of adoration: how shall any\n\np. 385\n\none be devoted to the forms of thy worship? Thou shalt without doubt lust\nafter her who is no fit object of thy desires!\' Through this curse of N\xc4\x81rada,\nthe creator of the world ceased to be an object of worship. Beholding the\nbeauty of his daughter, he ran after her. N\xc4\x81rada, having made obeisance to his\nlotus-born father, forsook his Br\xc4\x81hmanical body, and became a Gandharva, * a\nchorister of Indra\'s heaven."\n\nIn the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, N\xc4\x81rada figures as a religious teacher; and in the "Uttara\nK\xc4\x81nda" of the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana is a specimen of his teaching. \xe2\x80\xa0 A Br\xc4\x81hman, carrying\nthe dead body of his son, came to the door of R\xc4\x81ma\'s palace at Ayodha; and\nbewailing his loss, as he himself was unconscious of any fault, he believed it\nto be owing to some misconduct on the part of the king. R\xc4\x81ma summoned his\ncouncillors, when the divine sage N\xc4\x81rada spoke as follows: "Hear, O king, how\nthe boy\'s untimely death occurred; and, having heard the truth regarding what\nought to be done, do it." The story, briefly told, is as follows: "A\npresumptuous Sudra, paying no regard to the fact that during the age in which\nhe lived the prerogative of practising self-mortification had not descended to\nthe humble class to which he belonged, had been guilty of seeking to secure a\nstore of religious merit by its exercise. R\xc4\x81ma, after considerable search,\ncomes upon a person who was engaged in the manner described by N\xc4\x81rada. The\nSudra avows his caste, and his desire to conquer for himself the rank of a\ngod, by the self-mortification he was undergoing. R\xc4\x81ma instantly cuts off the\noffender\'s head; the gods applaud the deed, and, having been encouraged by\nthem to ask a boon, R\xc4\x81ma requests that the Br\xc4\x81hman\'s boy may be\n\np. 386\n\nresuscitated. He is informed that he was restored to life the very moment that\nthe Sudra was slain."\n\nN\xc4\x81rada was the friend and companion of Krishna, and was famed for his musical\ntalents, but, becoming presumptuous on account of them, he emulated the divine\nstrains of Krishna, who severely punished him for his presumption by placing\nhis vina in the paws of a bear, when it emitted sounds far sweeter than those\nof the minstrelsy of the mortified musician. Krishna played many practical\njokes on his friend; on one occasion he went so far as to metamorphose him\ninto a woman. *\n\nGreat honour is given to N\xc4\x81rada because he is said to have revealed to Valmiki\nthe "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," which opens as follows:--\n\n"To sainted N\xc4\x81rad, prince of those  \n Whose lore in words of wisdom flows,  \n Whose constant care and chief delights  \n Were scripture and ascetic rites,  \n The good Valmiki, first and best  \n Of hermit saints, these words addressed:  \n \'In all the world, I pray thee, who  \n Is virtuous, heroic, true?  \n Firm in his vows, of grateful mind,  \n To every creature good and kind?  \n Bounteous and holy, just and wise,  \n Alone most fair to all men\'s eyes?  \n Grant, saint divine, the boon I ask,  \n For thee, I ween, an easy task,  \n To whom the power is given to know  \n If such a man breathes here below.\'  \n Then N\xc4\x81rad, clear before whose eye  \n The present, past, and future lie,  \n Made ready answer!" \xe2\x80\xa0\n\np. 387\n\nN\xc4\x81rada proceeds to narrate the life of R\xc4\x81ma to Valmiki, who feels that the\ntask of writing down what was told him is too great a" work for his powers,\nuntil Brahm\xc4\x81 himself appears, and encourages him to proceed--\n\n"Then come, O best of seers, relate  \n The life of R\xc4\x81ma, good and great;  \n The tale that saintly N\xc4\x81rad told  \n In all its glorious length unfold." *\n\n![](img/38700.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[363:*](hmvp38.htm#fr_321) "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," p. 49.\n\n[364:*](hmvp38.htm#fr_322) Muir, O.
