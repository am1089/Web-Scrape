Declarations of extent are e.g. the following: 'By\nthis Person this whole Universe is filled'\n\np. 625\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _S_ vet. Up.

Up.);\n'The eternal, pervading, omnipresent, which the Wise consider as the source of\nall beings' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 6). The 'and the rest' in the Satra comprises\npassages such as 'Brahman indeed is all this,' 'The Self indeed is all this,'\nand the like. The conclusion is that the highest Brahman is absolutely\nsupreme.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the Highest.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 37.
