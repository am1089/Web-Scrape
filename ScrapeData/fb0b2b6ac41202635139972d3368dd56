 \nThree, with the crescent heads they bore,  \nDeep in his breast a passage tore.  \nThirteen, to which the stone had lent  \nThe keenest point, were swiftly sent  \nOn the fierce giant, every one  \nDestructive, gleaming like the sun.  \nWith four the dappled steeds he slew;  \nOne cleft the chariot yoke in two.  \nOne, in the heat of battle sped,  \nSmote from the neck the driver's head.  \nThe poles were rent apart by three;  \nTwo broke the splintered axle-tree.  \nThen from the hand of Rama, while  \nAcross his lips there came a smile.  \nThe twelfth, like thunderbolt impelled,  \nCut the great hand and bow it held.  \nThen, scarce by Indra's self surpassed,  \nHe pierced the giant with the last.  \nThe bow he trusted cleft in twain.  \nHis driver and his horses slain,  \nDown sprang the giant, mace in hand,  \nOn foot against the foe to stand.  \n   The Gods and saints in bright array  \n     Close gathered in the skies,  \n   The prince's might in battle-fray  \n     Beheld with joyful eyes.  \n   Uprising from their golden seats,  \n     Their hands in honour raised,  \n   They looked on Rama's noble feats,  \n     And blessed him as they praised.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[261:1b](ry226.htm#fr_474) 'This Asura was a friend of Indra, and taking\nadvantage of his friend's confidence, he drank up Indra's strength along with\na draught of wine and Soma.
