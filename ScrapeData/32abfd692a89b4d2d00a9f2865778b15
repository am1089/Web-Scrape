And on account of contradiction.\n\nThe origination of the _g_ iva is, moreover, distinctly controverted in the\nbooks of the Bhagavatas also. Thus in the Parama-sa _m_ hita 'The nature of\nPrak _ri_ ti consists therein that she is non-sentient, for the sake of\nanother, eternal, ever-changing, comprising within herself the three gu _n_\nas. and constituting the sphere of action and experience for all agents. With\nher the soul (purusha) is connected in the way of inseparable association;\nthat soul is known to be truly without beginning and without end.' And as all\nSa _m_ hitas make similar statements as to the eternity of the soul, the Pa _\xc3\xb1\nk_aratra doctrine manifestly controverts the view of the essential nature of\nthe _g_ iva being something that originates. How it is possible that in the\nVeda as well as in common life the soul is spoken of as being born, dying,\n&c., will be explained under Su. II, 3, 17. The conclusion, therefore, is that\nthe Bhagavata system also denies the origination of the soul, and that hence\nthe objections raised on this ground against its authoritativeness are without\nany force. Another objection is raised by some. Sa _nd_ ilya, they argue, is\nsaid to have promulgated the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra doctrine because he did not find a\nsure basis for the highest welfare of man in the Veda and its auxiliary\ndisciplines, and this implies that the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra is opposed to the Veda.\n--his objection, we reply, springs from nothing else but the mere unreasoning\nfaith of men who do not possess the faintest knowledge\n\np. 527\n\nof the teachings of the Veda, and have never considered the hosts of arguments\nwhich confirm that teaching. When the Veda says, 'Morning after morning those\nspeak untruth who make the Agnihotra offering before sunrise,' it is\nunderstood that the censure there passed on the offering before sunrise is\nreally meant to glorify the offering after sunrise. We meet with a similar\ncase in the 'bhuma-vidya' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 2). There at the beginning Narada\nsays, 'I know the _Ri_ g-veda, the Ya _g_ ur-veda, the Sama-veda, the \xc3\x82tharva\n_n_ a as the fourth, the Itihasa-pura _n_ a as the fifth,' and so on,\nenumerating all the various branches of knowledge, and finally summing up\n'with all this I know the mantras only, I do not know the Self.' Now this\ndeclaration of the knowledge of the Self not being attainable through any\nbranch of knowledge except the knowledge of the Bhuman evidently has no other\npurpose but to glorify this latter knowledge, which is about to be expounded.\nOr else Narada's words refer to the fact that from the Veda and its auxiliary\ndisciplines he had not obtained the knowledge of the highest Reality.\nAnalogous to this is the case of Sa _nd_ ilya's alleged objection to the Veda.\nThat the Bhagavata doctrine is meant to facilitate the understanding of the\nsense of the Veda which by itself is difficult of comprehension, is declared\nin the Paramasa _m_ hita,'I have read the Vedas at length, together with all\nthe various auxiliary branches of knowledge. But in all these I cannot see a\nclear indication, raised above all doubt, of the way to blessedness, whereby I\nmight reach perfection'; and 'The wise Lord Hari, animated by kindness for\nthose devoted to him, extracted the essential meaning of all the Vedanta-texts\nand condensed it in an easy form.' The incontrovertible fact then is as\nfollows. The Lord who is known from the Vedanta-texts, i.e. Vasudeva, called\nthere the highest Brahman--who is antagonistic to all evil, whose nature is of\nuniform excellence, who is an ocean, as it were, of unlimited exalted\nqualities, such as infinite intelligence, bliss, and so on, all whose purposes\ncome true--perceiving that those devoted to him, according as they are\ndifferently placed in the four castes and the\n\np. 528\n\nfour stages of life, are intent on the different ends of life, viz. religious\nobservances, wealth, pleasure, and final release; and recognising that the\nVedas--which teach the truth about his own nature, his glorious\nmanifestations, the means of rendering him propitious and the fruits of such\nendeavour--are difficult to fathom by all beings other than himself, whether\ngods or men, since those Vedas are divided into _Ri_ k, Ya _g_ us, Saman, and\nAtharvan; and being animated by infinite pity, tenderness, and magnanimity;\nwith a view to enable his devotees to grasp the true meaning of the Vedas,\nhimself composed the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra- _s_ astra. The author of the Sutras\n(Vyasa)--who first composed the Sutras, the purport of which it is to set\nforth the arguments establishing the Vedanta doctrine, and then the Bharata-sa\n_m_ hita (i.e. the Mahabharata) in a hundred thousand _s_ lokas in order to\nsupport thereby the teaching of the Veda--himself says in the chapter called\nMokshadharma, which treats of knowledge, 'If a householder, or a Brahma _k_\narin, or a hermit, or a mendicant wishes to achieve success, what deity should\nhe worship?' and so on; explains then at great length the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra\nsystem, and then says, 'From the lengthy Bharata story, comprising one hundred\nthousand _s_ lokas, this body of doctrine has been extracted, with the\nchurning-staff of mind, as butter is churned from curds--as butter from milk,\nas the Brahma _n_ a from men, as the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka from the Vedas, as Am _ri_\nta from medicinal herbs.--This great Upanishad, consistent with the four\nVedas, in harmony with Sa _n_ khya and Yoga, was called by him by the name of\nPa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra. This is excellent, this is Brahman, this is supremely\nbeneficial. Fully agreeing with the _Ri_ k, the Ya _g_ us, the Saman, and the\nAtharvan-giras, this doctrine will be truly authoritative.' The terms Sa _n_\nkhya and Yoga here denote the concentrated application of knowledge and of\nworks. As has been said, 'By the application of knowledge on the part of the\nSa _n_ khya, and of works on the part of the Yogins.' And in the Bhishmaparvan\nwe read, 'By Brahma _n_ as, Kshattriyas, Vai _s_ yas and _S_ udras, Madhava is\nto be honoured, served and worshipped--he who was proclaimed by Sa _n_ karsha\n_n_ a\n\np. 529\n\nin agreement with the Satvata law.'--How then could these utterances of\nBadaraya _n_ a, the foremost among all those who understand the teaching of\nthe Veda, be reconciled with the view that in the Sutras he maintains the non-\nauthoritativeness of the Satvata doctrine, the purport of which is to teach\nthe worship of, and meditation on, Vasudeva, who is none other than the\nhighest Brahman known from the Vedanta-texts?\n\nBut other passages in the Mahabharata, such as 'There is the Sa _n_ khya, the\nYoga, the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra, the Vedas, and the Pa _s_ upata doctrine; do all\nthese rest on one and the same basis, or on different ones?' and so on,\ndeclare that the Sa _n_ khya and other doctrines also are worthy of regard,\nwhile yet in the _S_ ariraka Sutras those very same doctrines are formally\nrefuted. Why, therefore, should not the same hold good in the case of the\nBhagavata doctrine?--Not so, we reply. In the Mahabharata also Badaraya _n_ a\napplies to the Sa _n_ khya and other doctrines the same style of reasoning as\nin the Sutras. The question, asked in the passage quoted, means 'Do the Sa _n_\nkhya, the Yoga, the Pa _s_ upata, and the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra set forth one and the\nsame reality, or different ones? If the former, what is that reality? If the\nlatter, they convey contradictory doctrines, and, as reality is not something\nwhich may be optionally assumed to be either such or such, one of those\ndoctrines only can be acknowledged as authoritative, and the question then\narises which is to be so acknowledged?'--The answer to the question is given\nin the passage beginning, 'Know, O royal Sage, all those different views. The\npromulgator of the Sa _n_ khya is Kapila,' &c. Here the human origin of the Sa\n_n_ khya, Yoga, and Pa _s_ upata is established on the ground of their having\nbeen produced by Kapila, Hira _n_ yagarbha, and Pa _s_ upati. Next the clause\n'Aparantatamas is said to be the teacher of the Vedas' intimates the non-human\ncharacter of the Vedas; and finally the clause 'Of the whole Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra,\nNaraya _n_ a himself is the promulgator' declares that Naraya _n_ a himself\nrevealed the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra doctrine. The connected purport of these different\nclauses is as follows. As the systems\n\np. 530\n\nof human origin set forth doctrines mutually contradictory, and, moreover,\nteach what is in conflict with the matter known from the Veda--which, on\naccount of its non-human character, is raised above all suspicion of error and\nother imperfections--they cannot be accepted as authoritative with regard to\nanything not depending on human action and choice. Now the matter to be known\nfrom the Veda is Naraya _n_ a, who is none other than the highest Brahman. It\nhence follows that the entities set forth in those different systems--the\npradhana, the soul (purusha), Pa _s_ upati, and so on--have to be viewed as\nreal only in so far as Naraya _n_ a, i.e. the highest Brahman, as known from\nthe Vedanta-texts, constitutes their Self. This the text directly declares in\nthe passage, 'In all those doctrines it is seen, in accordance with tradition\nand reasoning, that the lord Narayawa is the only basis.' This means--'To him\nwho considers the entities set forth in those systems with the help of\nargumentation, it is evident that Naraya _n_ a alone is the basis of all those\nentities.' In other words, as the entities set forth in those systems are not\nBrahman, any one who remembers the teaching of texts such as 'all this indeed\nis Brahman,' 'Naraya _n_ a is all,' which declare Brahman to be the Self of\nall, comes to the conclusion that Naraya _n_ a alone is the basis of those\nentities. As thus it is settled that the highest Brahman, as known from the\nVedanta-texts, or Naraya _n_ a, himself is the promulgator of the entire Pa _\xc3\xb1\nk_aratra, and that this system teaches the nature of Naraya _n_ a and the\nproper way of worshipping him, none can disestablish the view that in the Pa\n_\xc3\xb1 k_aratra all the other doctrines are comprised. For this reason the\nMahabharata says, 'Thus the Sa _n_ khya-yoga and the Veda and the \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka, being members of one another, are called the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra,' i.e. the\nSa _n_ khya, the Yoga, the Vedas, and the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, which are members of\none another because they are one in so far as aiming at setting forth one\nTruth, together are called the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra.--The Sa _n_ khya explains the\ntwenty-five principles, the Yoga teaches certain practices and means of mental\nconcentration, and the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas teach that all the subordinate\n\np. 531\n\nprinciples have their true Self in Brahman, that the mental concentration\nenjoined in the Yoga is a mode of meditation on Brahman, and that the rites\nand works which are set forth in the Veda are means to win the favour of\nBrahman--thus giving instruction as to Brahman's nature. Now all these\nelements, in their inward connexion, are clearly set forth in the Pa _\xc3\xb1\nk_aratra by the highest Brahman, i.e. Naraya _n_ a, himself. The _S_ ariraka\n_S_ astra (i.e. the Vedanta) does not disprove the principles assumed by the\nSa _n_ khyas, but merely the view of their not having Brahman for their Self;\nand similarly in its criticism on the Yoga and Pa _s_ upata systems, it merely\nrefutes the view of the Lord being a mere instrumental cause, the erroneous\nassumptions as to the relative position of higher and lower entities, and\ncertain practices not warranted by the Veda; but it does not reject the Yoga\nitself, nor again the lord Pa _s_ upati. Hence Sm _ri_ ti says,' The Sa _n_\nkhya, the Yoga, the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_aratra, the Vedas, and the P _s_ upata doctrine--\nall these having their proof in the Self may not be destroyed by arguments.'\nThe essential points in all these doctrines are to be adopted, not to be\nrejected absolutely as the teaching of _G_ ina. or Sugata is to be rejected.\nFor, as said in the Sm _ri_ ti text quoted above, in all those doctrines it is\nseen, according to tradition and reasoning, that the lord Naraya _n_ a is the\nonly basis.'--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the impossibility of\norigination.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Third Pada: 1.
