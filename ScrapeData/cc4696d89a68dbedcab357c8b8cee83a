Naraya _n_ a said :-- Now I am speaking of the very holy Sandhyopasana\nmethod of Sandhya worship of Gayatri, the Presiding Deity of the morning,\nmidday and evening, and of the twice-born. Listen. The greatness of using\nBhasma has been described in detail. No further need be stated on the subject.\nI shall talk, first of all, of the morning Sandhya. The morning Sandhya is to\nbe done early in the morning while the stars are visible. When the Sun is in\nthe meridian, the midday Sandhya is to be performed; and while the Sun is\nvisibly going down, the\n\n\n\np. 1099\n\n\n\nevening Sandhya is to be recited over. Now again, the distinctions are made in\nthe above three Sandhyas :-- The morning Sandhya with stars seen is the best;\nwith stars disappeared, middling; and with the Sun risen above the horizon,\ninferior. So the evening Sandhya, again, is of three kinds :-- best, middling,\nand inferior. When the Sun is visibly disappearing, the evening Sandhya is the\nbest; when the Sun has gone down the horizon, it is middling and when the\nstars are visible, it is inferior. The Brahma _n_ as are the root of the Tree,\nthe Sandhya Vandanam; the Vedas are the branches; the religious actions are\nthe leaves. Therefore its root should be carefully preserved. If the root be\ncut, no branches or leaves of the tree will remain. That Brahma _n_ a who\nknows not his Sandhya or who does not perform the Sandhyas is a living S\xc2\x92udra.\nThat Brahma _n_ a after his death verily becomes a dog. Therefore the Sandhyas\nmust be observed every day. Otherwise no right comes at all to do any action.\nAt the sunrise and the sunset the time for Sandhya is two Da _nd_ as (48\nminutes) and if Sandhya be not done or rather neglected in the interval, the\nPrayas\xc2\x92chitta (penance) is to he paid duly (performed duly). If the proper\ntime for Sandhya expires, one more offering of Arghya is to be made in\naddition to the three Arghayas daily made or the Gayatri is to be repeated one\nhundred and eight times before the Sandhya is commenced. In whichever time any\naction ought to be done, worship, first of all, the Sandhya Devi, the\nPresiding Deity of that time and do the actions proper to that time\nafterwards. The Sandhya performed in dwelling houses is ordinary; the Sandhya\ndone in enclosures of cows is middling and on the banks of the rivers is good\nand the Sandhya performed before the Devi\xc2\x92s temple or the Devi\xc2\x92s seat is very\nexcellent. The Sandhyopasana ought to be done before the Devi, because that is\nthe worship of the very Devi. The three Sandhyas done before the Devi give\ninfinitely excellent fruits. There is no other work of the Brahma _n_ as\nbetter than this Sandhya. One can rather avoid worshipping S\xc2\x92iva or Vi _sn_ u;\nbecause that is not daily done as obligatory; but the Sandhyopasana ought to\nbe done daily. The Gayatri of the Great Devi is the Essence of all the mantras\nin the Vedas. In the Veda S\xc2\x92astras, the worship of Gayatri is most definitely\npronounced. Brahma and the other Devas meditate in the Sandhya times on this\nDevi Gayatri and make a japam of that. The Vedas always make japams of Her.\nFor this reason the Gayatri has been mentioned as the object of worship by the\nVedas. The Brahma _n_ as are called S\xc2\x92aktas inasmuch as they worship the\nPrimal S\xc2\x92akti (Force) Gayatri, the Mother of the Vedas. They are not S\xc2\x92aivas\nnor Vai _sn_ avas.\n\n\n\np. 1100\n\n\n\nFirstly make the ordinary \xc3\x82chaman three times, and, while inhaling, drink a\nlittle of the water of \xc3\x82chaman, repeating \xc2\x93Om Kes\xc2\x92avaya Svaha, Om Naraya _n_\naya Svaha, Om Madhavaya Svaha.\xc2\x94 Then wash your two hands, repeating \xc2\x93Om\nGobindaya Nama _h_ , Om Vi _sn_ ave Nama _h_.\xc2\x94 Then by the root of the thumb\nrub the lips repeating \xc2\x93Om Madhu sudanaya Nama _h_ , Om Trivikramaya Nama\n_h_.\xc2\x94 So rub the mouth, repeating \xc2\x93Om Vamamaya Nama _h_ , Om S\xc2\x92ridharaya Nama\n_h_.\xc2\x94 Then sprinkle water on the left hand, saying \xc2\x93Om Hrisikes\xc2\x92aya Nama _h_.\xc2\x94\nSprinkle water on the legs, saying \xc2\x93Om Padmanabhaya Nama _h_.\xc2\x94 Sprinkle water\non the head, saying \xc2\x93Om Damodaraya Nama _h_.\xc2\x94 Touch the mouth with the three\nfingers of the right hand, saying \xc2\x93Om Samkar _s_ a _n_ aya Nama _h_.\xc2\x94 Touch\nthe nostrils with the thumb and forefinger saying \xc2\x93Om Vasudevaya Nama _h_ , Om\nPradyumnaya Nama _h_.\xc2\x94 Touch the eyes with the thumb and ring-finger, saying\n\xc2\x93Om Aniruddhaya Nama _h_ , Om Puru _s_ ottamaya Nama _h_.\xc2\x94 Touch the ears with\nthe thumb and ringfinger saying \xc2\x93Om Adhok _s_ ajaya Nama _h_ , Om Narasimhaya\nNama _h_.\xc2\x94 Touch the navel with the thumb and little finger saying \xc2\x93Om\nAchyutaya Nama _h_.\xc2\x94 Touch the breast with the palm, saying \xc2\x93Om Janardanaya\nNama _h_.\xc2\x94 Touch the head saying \xc2\x93Om Upendraya Nama _h_.\xc2\x94 Touch the roots of\nthe two arms saying \xc2\x93Om Haraye Nama _h_ , Om Kri _sn_ aya Nama _h_.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n25-50. While sipping the \xc3\x82chaman water on the right hand, touch the right hand\nwith your left hand; otherwise; the water does not become pure. While doing\n\xc3\x82chaman, make the palm and the fingers all united and close, of the form of a\nGokar _n_ a (the ear of a cow) and spreading the thumb and the little finger,\ndrink the water of the measure of a pea. If a greater or less quantity be\nsipped, then that would amount to drinking liquor. Then thinking of the Pra\n_n_ ava, make the Pra _n_ ayama, and repeat mentally the Gayatri with her head\nand the Turiya pada, i.e., \xc3\x82pojyoti _h_ rasomritam Brahma Bhurbhuvah svarom.\nInhale the air by the left nostril (Purak), close both the nostrils (Kumbhak)\nand exhale the air, by the right nostril (Rechak). Thus Pra _n_ ayama is\neffected. While doing Purak, Kumbhak and Rechak repeat the Gayatri every time;\nhold the right nostril with the right thumb and hold the left nostril with the\nringfinger and little finger (i.e., don\xc2\x92t use forefinger and middle finger).\n\n\n\nThe Yogis who have controlled their minds say that Pra _n_ ayama is effected\nby the three processes Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka. The external air is\ninhaled in Puraka; air is not exhaled nor inhaled (it is retained inside) in\nKumbhaka; and air is exhaled in Rechaka. While\n\n\n\np. 1101\n\n\n\ndoing Puraka, meditate on the navel, the four-armed high-souled Vi _sn_ u, of\nthe blue colour (Syama) like the blue lotus. While doing Kumbhaka, meditate in\nthe heart lotus the four-faced grandsire Brahma Prajapati, the Creator seated\non the lotus and while doing Rechaka meditate, on the fore-head, on the white\nsin-destroying S\xc2\x92ankara, pure as crystal. In Puraka, the union with Vi _sn_ u\nis obtained; in Kumbhaka, the knowledge of Brahma is attained and in Rechaka,\nthe highest position of \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92vara (S\xc2\x92iva) is attained. This is the method of\n\xc3\x82chaman according to the Pura _n_ as. Now I am speaking of the all sin\ndestroying Vaidik \xc3\x82chaman. Listen. Reciting the Gayatri mantra \xc2\x93Om\nBhurbhuvah,\xc2\x94 sip a little water; this is the Vaidik \xc3\x82chaman after repeating\nthe seven great Vyahritis Om Bhu _h_ ; Om Bhuva _h_ , Om Sva _h,_ Om Maha _h_\n, Om Jana _h_ , Om Tapa _h_ , Om Satyam, repeat Gayatri and the head of the\nGayatri \xc3\x82pojyoti Rasomritam Brahma Bhurbhuva _h_ svarom and practise Pra _n_\nayama three times. Hereby all sins are destroyed and all virtues spring. Now\nanother sort of Pra _n_ ayama Mudra is described :-- The Vanaprasthis and\nGrihasthas would do Pra _n_ ayama with five fingers, holding the tip of the\nnose; the Brahmacharis and Yatis would do Pra _n_ ayama with the thumbs,\nlittle finger, and ring finger (avoiding middle and fore). Now I am speaking\nof the \xc3\x82ghama _s_ a _n_ a Marjana mantra. Listen. The Mantra of this Marjana\nis \xc2\x93\xc3\x82pohi _st_ ha Mayobhuvah, etc.\xc2\x94 There are three mantras in this. There are\nthree Padas in every mantra, prefix Om to every pada (thus nine times Om is to\nbe prefixed); at the end of every pada sprinkle water on the head with the\nsacrificial thread and the Kus\xc2\x92a grass. Or at the end of every mantra do so.\nBy the above Marjana (cleaning) the sins of one hundred years are instantly\ndestroyed. Then making \xc3\x82chaman (taking a sip of water to rinse the mouth\nbefore worship), repeat the three Mantras \xc2\x93Om Suryas\xc2\x92cha ma manyus\xc2\x92cha, etc.\xc2\x94\nBy this act, the mental sins are destroyed. As marjana is done with Pra _n_\nava, Vyarhitis, and Gayatri, so make Marjana by the three mantras \xc2\x91\xc2\x91\xc3\x82pohi _st_\nha, etc.\xc2\x94 Make your right palm of the shape of a cow\xc2\x92s ear; take water in it\nand carry it before your nose and think thus :-- \xc2\x93There is a terrible sinful\nperson in my left abdomen, his colour is dark black and he is horrible\nlooking.\xc2\x94 Recite, then, the mantras \xc2\x93Om ritamcha satyamchabhidhyat, etc.\xc2\x94 and\n\xc2\x93Drupadadiva Mumuchana, etc.\xc2\x94 and bring that Sinful Person through your right\nnostril to the water in the palm. Don\xc2\x92t look at that water; throw it away on a\nbit of stone to your left. And think that you are now sinless. Next, rising\nfrom the seat, keep your two feet horizontal and with the fingers save\nforefinger and thumb, take a palmful of water and with your face towards the\nSun, recite the Gayatri three times\n\n\n\np. 1102\n\n\n\nand offer water to the Sun three times. Thus, O Muni! The method of offering\nthe Arghyas has been mentioned to you.\n\n\n\n51-80. Then circumambulate, repeating the Surya Mantra. The one thing to be\nnoted in offering Arghyas is this :-- Offer once in the midday, and three\ntimes in the morning and three times in the evening. While offering the Arghya\nin the morning, bend yourself a little low; in offering the arghya in the\nmidday, stand up; and while offering the arghya in the evening, it can be done\nwhile sitting. Now I will tell you why the Arghya is offered to the Sun. Hear.\nThirty Ko _t_ i Rak _s_ asas known as the Mandehas, always roam on the path of\nthe Sun (the mental Sun also). They are great heroes, treacherous and\nferocious. They always try to devour the Sun, while they assume terrible\nforms. For this reason the Devas and the Ri _s_ is combined offer the water\nwith their folded hands to the Sun, while they perform the great Sandhya\nUpasana. The water thus offered, becomes transformed into the thunderbolt and\nburns the heads of the cruel demons (and throws them on the island Mandeharu\n_n_ a) Therefore the Brahma _n_ as daily do their Sandhyopasana. Infinite\nmerits accrue from this Sandhya Upasana. O Narada! Now I am speaking to you of\nthe Mantras pertaining to the Arghya. No sooner they are pronounced the full\neffects of performing the Sandhyas are obtained. I am That Sun; I am That\nLight; I am That \xc3\x82tman (Self); I am S\xc2\x92iva; I am the Light of \xc3\x82tman; I am clear\nand transparently white; I am of the nature of all energy; and I am of the\nnature of Rasa (the sweetness, all the sweet sentiments). O Devi! O Gayatri! O\nThou! Who art of the nature of Brahma! Let Thee come and preside in my heart\nto grant me success in this Japa Karma. O Devi! O Gayatri! Entering into my\nheart, go out again with this water. But Thou wouldst have to come again. Sit\nthus on a pure seat and with a single intent repeat the Gayatri, the Mother of\nthe Vedas. O Muni! In this Sandhyopasana, the Khhechari Mudra ought to be done\nafter practising the Pra _n_ ayama. Hear now the meaning of the Khhechari\nMudra. When the soul of a being leaves the objects of senses, it roams in the\n\xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a, i.e., it becomes aimless when the tongue also goes to the \xc3\x82kas\xc2\x92a and\nroams there; and then the sight is fixed between the eyebrows; this is called\nthe Khhechari Mudra. There is no \xc3\x82sana (seat) equal to Siddhasana and there is\nno Vayu (air) equal to the Khumbaka Vaya (suspension of air in the body).\n\n\n\nO Narada! There is no Mudra equal to the Khhechari Mudra. One is to pronounce\nPra _n_ ava in Pluta (protracted) accents like the sound of a bell and,\nsuspending his breath, sit quiet motionless in Sthirasana without any Ahamkara\n(egoism). O Narada! I am now talking of\n\n\n\np. 1103\n\n\n\nSiddhasana and its characteristic qualities. Hear. Keep one heel below the\nroot of the genital and the other heel below the scrotum; keep the whole body\nand breast straight and motionless; withdraw the senses from their objects and\nlook at the point, the pituitary body, between the eyebrows. This posture is\ncalled the Siddhasan and is pleasant to the yogis. After taking this seat,\ninvoke the Gayatri. \xc2\x93O Mother of the Vedas! O Gayatri! Thou art the Devi\ngranting boons to the Bhaktas. Thou art of the nature of Brahma. Be gracious\nunto Me. O Devi! Whoever worships Thee in the day gets his day sins destroyed\nand in the night, night sins destroyed. O Thou! Who art all the letters of the\nalphabet! O Devi! O Sandhye! O Thou who art of the nature of Vidya! O\nSarasvati! O Ajaye! O Thou immortal! Free from disease and decay. O Mother!\nWho art all the Devas! I bow down to Thee.\xc2\x94 Invoke the Devi again by the\nmantra \xc2\x93Ojosi, etc ,\xc2\x94 and then pray :-- \xc2\x93O Mother! Let my japam and other acts\nin Thy worship be fulfilled with success by Thy Grace.\xc2\x94 Next for the freedom\nof the curse of Gayatri, do the things properly. Brahma gave a curse to\nGayatri; Vis\xc2\x92vamitra gave a curse to Her and Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha also cursed Her.\nThese are the three curses; they are removed in due order by recollecting\nBrahma, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra and Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha. Before doing Nyasa, one ought to\ncollect oneself and remember the Highest Self; think in the lotus of the heart\nthat Puru _s_ a (Person) who is Truth; who is all this Universe, who is the\nHighest Self and who is All knowledge and who cannot be comprehended by words.\nNow I am speaking of the Amganyasa of Sandhya; Hear. First utter Om and then\nutter the mantra.\n\n\n\nTouch the two legs, saying \xc2\x93Om Bhu _h_ padabhyam nama _h_ \xc2\x94\n\nTouch the knees, saying \xc2\x93Om Bhuva Janubhyam nama _h_ \xc2\x94\n\nTouch the hip, saying \xc2\x93Om Sva _h_ Ka _t_ ibhyam nama _h_ \xc2\x94\n\nTouch the navel, saying \xc2\x93Om Maharnabhyai nama _h_ \xc2\x94\n\nTouch the heart, saying \xc2\x93Om Jana _h_ Hridayaya nama _h_ \xc2\x94\n\nTouch the throat, saying \xc2\x93Om Tapa _h_ Ka _nt_ haya nama _h_ \xc2\x94\n\nTouch the forehead, saying \xc2\x93Om Satyam Lala _t_ aya nama _h_ \xc2\x94\n\nThus perform the Vyarhiti nyasa.\n\n\n\nNext perform the Karamganyasa thus :-- Om Tat savitu _h_ ramgu _st_ habhyam\nnama _h_ (referring to the thumb); Om Varenyam Tarjanibhyam nama _h_\n(referring to the forefinger); Om bhargo devasya madhyama bhyam nama _h_\n(referring to the middle finger); Om Dhimahi anamikabhyam nama _h_ (referring\nto the ringfinger); Om dhiyo yona _h_ , Kanisthabyam nama _h_ (referring to\nthe little finger); Om prachodayat kara tal pristhabhyam nama _h_ (referring\nto the upper part and lower part of the palm and all over the body).\n\n\n\n81-106. Now I am speaking of the Amganyasa. Hear. Om tat savitur Brahma tmane\nhridayaya nama _h_ (referring to the heart.)\n\n\n\np. 1104\n\n\n\nOm Varenyam Vi _sn_ va tmane S\xc2\x92irase nama _h_ (referring to the head); Om\nbhargo devasya Rudratmane S\xc2\x92ikhayai nama _h_ (referring to the crown of the\nhead);  Om dhimahi S\xc2\x92aktyatmane Kavachaya nama _h_ (referring to the Kavacha);\nOm dhiyoyona _h_ Kalatmane netratrayaya nama _h_ (referring to the three\neyes); Om prachodayat sarvatmane astraya nama _h_ (referring to the Astra or\narmour, protecting the body). Now I am speaking of the Var _n_ anyasa. O Great\nMuni! Hear. This Var _n_ anyasa is performed by the letters in the Gayatri\nmantra. If anybody does this, he becomes freed of sins.\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93Om Tat nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the two toes; (touching them).\n\n\xc2\x93Om Sa nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the two heels; (touching them).\n\n\xc2\x93Om Vi nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the legs;\n\n\xc2\x93Om Tu nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the two knees;\n\n\xc2\x93Om Va nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the two thighs;\n\n\xc2\x93Om re nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the anus;\n\n\xc2\x93Om _n_ i nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the generative organ;\n\n\xc2\x93Om ya nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the hip;\n\n\xc2\x93Om bha nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the navel;\n\n\xc2\x93Om Rgo nama _h_ on the heart;\n\n\xc2\x93Om De nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the breasts;\n\n\xc2\x93Om va nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the heart;\n\n\xc2\x93Om sya nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the throat;\n\n\xc2\x93Om dhi nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the mouth;\n\n\xc2\x93Om ma nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the palate;\n\n\xc2\x93Om hi nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the tip of the nose;\n\n\xc2\x93Om dhi nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the two eyes;\n\n\xc2\x93Om yo nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the space between the eye-brows;\n\n\xc2\x93Om yo nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the forehead;\n\n\xc2\x93Om na _h_ nama _h_ \xc2\x94 to the east;\n\n\xc2\x93Om pra nama _h_ \xc2\x94 to the south;\n\n\xc2\x93Om cho nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the west;\n\n\xc2\x93Om da nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the north;\n\n\xc2\x93Om ya nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the head;\n\n\xc2\x93Om ta nama _h_ \xc2\x94 on the whole body from head to foot.\n\n\n\nSome Japakas (those who do the Japam) do not approve of the above nyasa. Thus\nthe Nyasa is to be done. Then meditate on the Gayatri or the World-Mother. The\nbeauty of the body of the Gayatri Devi is like that of the full blown Java\nflower. She is seated on the big red lotus on the back of the Ha _n_ sa\n(Flamingo); She is holding the red coloured garland on Her neck and anointed\nwith red coloured unguent. She has four faces;\n\n\n\np. 1105\n\n\n\nevery face has two eyes. On her four hands are a wreath of flowers, a\nsacrificial ladle, a bead, and a Kama _nd_ alu. She is blazing with all sorts\nof ornaments. From the Devi Gayatri has originated first the Rig veda. Brahma\nworships the virgin Gayatri; on the idea of S\xc2\x92ri Parames\xc2\x92vari Gayatri has four\nfeet. The Rig Veda is one; the Yajurveda is the second, the Samaveda is the\nthird and the Atharva veda is the fourth foot. The Gayatri has eight bellies;\nthe east side is the one; the south is the second; the west is the third; the\nnorth is the fourth; the zenith is the fifth; the nadir is the sixth; the\nintermediate space is the seventh and all the corners are the eighth belly.\nGayatri has seven S\xc2\x92iras (heads); Vyakara _n_ am (Grammar) is one; S\xc2\x92ik _s_ a\nis the second (that Amga of the Veda, the science which teaches the proper\npronunciation of words and laws of euphony); Kalpa is the third (the Vedanga\nwhich lays down the ritual and prescribes rules for ceremonial and sacrificial\nacts); Nirukta is the fourth (the Vedanga that contains glossarial explanation\nof obscure words, especially those occurring in the Vedas); Jyotish or\nastronomy is the fifth; Itahasa (history) and Pura _n_ as is the sixth head;\nand Upani _s_ adas is the seventh head. Ag _n_ i (fire) is the mouth of\nGayatri; Rudra is the S\xc2\x92ikha (the chief part); Her gotra (lineage) is\nSamkhyaya _n_ a; Vi _sn_ u is the heart of Gayatri and Brahma is the armour of\nGayatri. Think of this Mahes\xc2\x92vari Gayatri in the middle of the Solar Orb.\nMeditating on the Gayatri Devi as above, the devotee should shew the following\ntwenty-four Mudras (signs by the fingers, etc., in religious worship) for the\nsatisfaction of the Devi :-- (1) Sanmukh; (2) Sampu _t_ ; (3) Vitata (4)\nVistrita; (5) Dvimukha; (6) Trimukha; (7) Chaturmukha; (8) Panchamukha; (9)\n_S_ a _n_ mukha; (10) Adhomukha; (11) Vyapaka; (12) Anjali; (13) S\xc2\x92aka _t_ a\n(14) Yamapas\xc2\x92a; (15) fingers intertwined end to end; (16) Vilamba (17) Mu _st_\nika; (18) Matsya; (19) Kurma; (20) Varaha; (21) Simhakranta; (22) Mahakranta;\n(23) Mudgara; (24) Pallava. Next make japam once only of one hundred syllabled\nGayatri. Thus twenty-four syllabled Savitri, \xc2\x93Jatavedase sunavama, etc.,\xc2\x94\nforty-four syllabled mantra; and the thirty two syllabled mantra, \xc2\x93Tryamvakam\nJajamahe, etc.\xc2\x94 These three mantras united make up one hundred lettered\nGayatri. (The full context of the last Mantra is this :-- Om Haum Om yum sa\n_h_ \\- Trayamvakam yajamahe Sugandhim Pu _st_ i Vardhanam. Urbharukamiva\nbandhanan mrityo muksiya ma mritat Bhur Bhhuvah. Svarom Yum Sva _h_ Bhurbhuvah\nSvarom Haum.) Next make japam of Bhurbhuvah Sva _h_ , twenty four lettered\nGayatri with Om. O Narada! The Brahma _n_ as are to perform daily the Sandhyo\npasana repeating Gayatri, completely adopting the rules above prescribed and\nthen he will be able to enjoy completely pleasures, happiness and bliss.\n\n\n\np. 1106\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixteenth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the description of\nSandhya Upasana in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagvatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 17](bk11ch17.htm)\n\n'
