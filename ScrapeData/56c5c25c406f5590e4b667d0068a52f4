VII.\n\nSons of Pururavas. Descendants of Amavasu. Indra born as Gadhi. Legend of\nRichika and Satyavati. Birth of Jamadagni and Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra. Para\xc5\x9burama the son\nof the former. (Legend of Para\xc5\x9burama.) Sunah\xc5\x9bephas and others the sons of\nVi\xc5\x9bwamitra, forming the Kau\xc5\x9bika race.\n\nPUR\xc3\x9aRAVAS had six sons, \xc3\x81yus, Dhimat, Amavasu, Vi\xc5\x9bwavasu, \xc5\x9aatayus, and\n\xc5\x9arutayus 1. The son of Amavasu was Bhima 2; his son was Kanchana 3; his son\nwas Suhotra 4, whose [son](errata.htm#19) was Jahnu. This prince, whilst\nperforming a sacrifice, saw the whole of the place overflowed by the waters of\nthe Ganges. Highly offended at this intrusion, his eyes red with anger, he\nunited the spirit of sacrifice with himself, by the power of his devotion, and\ndrank up the river. The gods and sages upon this came to him, and appeased his\nindignation, and reobtained Ganga from him, in the capacity of his daughter\n(whence she is called Jahnavi) 5.\n\np. 399\n\nThe son of Jahnu was Sumantu 6; his son was Ajaka; his son was Valaka\xc5\x9bwa 7;\nhis son was Ku\xc5\x9ba 8, who had four sons, Ku\xc5\x9bamba, Ku\xc5\x9banabha, Amurttaya, and\nAmavasu 9. Ku\xc5\x9bamba, being desirous of a son, engaged in devout penance to\nobtain one who should be equal to Indra. Observing the intensity of his\ndevotions, Indra was alarmed lest a prince of power like his own should be\nengendered, and determined therefore to take upon himself the character of\nKu\xc5\x9bamba\'s son 10. He was accordingly born as Gadhi, of the race of Ku\xc5\x9ba\n(Kau\xc5\x9bika). Gadhi had a daughter named Satyavati. Richika, of the descendants\nof Bhrigu, demanded her in marriage. The king was very unwilling to give his\ndaughter to a peevish old Brahman, and demanded of him, as the nuptial\npresent, a thousand fleet horses, whose colour should be white, with one black\near. Richika having propitiated Varun\xcc\x81a, the god of ocean, obtained from him,\nat the holy place called A\xc5\x9bwatirtha, a thousand such steeds; and giving them\nto the king, espoused his daughter 11.\n\nIn order to effect the birth of a son, Richika 12 prepared a dish of rice,\nbarley, and pulse, with butter and milk, for his wife to eat; and at her\n\np. 400\n\nrequest he consecrated a similar mixture for her mother, by partaking of which\nshe should give birth to a prince of martial prowess. Leaving both dishes with\nhis wife, after describing particularly which was intended for her, and which\nfor her mother, the sage went forth to the forests. When the time arrived for\nthe food to be eaten, the queen said to Satyavati, "Daughter, all persons wish\ntheir children to be possessed of excellent qualities, and would be mortified\nto see them surpassed by the merits of their mother\'s brother. It will be\ndesirable for you, therefore, to give me the mess your husband has set apart\nfor you, and to eat of that intended for me; for the son which it is to\nprocure me is destined to be the monarch of the whole world, whilst that which\nyour dish would give you must be a Brahman, alike devoid of affluence, valour,\nand power." Satyavati agreed to her mother\'s proposal, and they exchanged\nmesses.\n\nWhen Richika returned home, and beheld Satyavati, he said to her, "Sinful\nwoman, what hast thou done! I view thy body of a fearful appearance. Of a\nsurety thou hast eaten the consecrated food which was prepared for thy mother:\nthou hast done wrong. In that food I had infused the properties of power and\nstrength and heroism; in thine, the qualities suited to a Brahman, gentleness,\nknowledge, and resignation. In consequence of having reversed my plans, thy\nson shall follow a warrior\'s propensities, and use weapons, and fight, and\nslay. Thy mother\'s son shall be born with the inclinations of a Brahman, and\nbe addicted to peace and piety." Satyavati, hearing this, fell at her\nhusband\'s feet, and said, "My lord, I have done this thing through ignorance;\nhave compassion on me; let me not have a son such as thou hast foretold: if\nsuch there must be, let it be my grandson, not my son." The Muni, relenting at\nher distress, replied, "So let it be." Accordingly in due season she gave\nbirth to Jamadagni; and her mother brought forth Viswamitra. Satyavati\nafterwards became the Kau\xc5\x9biki river 13. Jamadagni married Ren\xcc\x81uka, the\ndaughter of Ren\xcc\x81u, of the\n\np. 401\n\nfamily of Ikshwaku, and had by her the destroyer of the Kshatriya race,\nPara\xc5\x9burama, who was a portion of Narayan\xcc\x81a, the spiritual guide of the\nuniverse 14.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[398:1](vp099.htm#fr_1046) Considerable variety prevails in these names, and\nthe Matsya, Padma, Brahma, and Agni enumerate eight. The lists are as follows:\n\nMahabharata.\n\n|\n\nMatsya.\n\n|\n\nAgni.\n\n|\n\nKurma.\n\n|\n\nBhagavata.  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n\xc3\x81yus\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x81yus\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x81yus\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x81yus\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x81yus  \n  \nDhimat\n\n|\n\nDhritimat\n\n|\n\nDhimat\n\n|\n\nMayus\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9arutayus  \n  \nAmavasu\n\n|\n\nVasu\n\n|\n\nVasu\n\n|\n\nAmayus\n\n|\n\nSatyayus  \n  \nDrid\xcc\x81hayus\n\n|\n\nDrid\xcc\x81hayus\n\n|\n\nU\xc5\x9brayus\n\n|\n\nVi\xc5\x9bwayus\n\n|\n\nRaya  \n  \nVanayus\n\n|\n\nDhanayus\n\n|\n\nAntayus\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9aatayus\n\n|\n\nVijaya  \n  \n\xc5\x9aatayus\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9aatayus\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9aatayus\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9arutayus\n\n|\n\nJaya  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nA\xc5\x9bwayus\n\n|\n\nRitayus\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nDivijata\n\n|\n\nDivijata.\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[paragraph continues] The list of the Brahma is that of the Mahabharata, with\nthe addition of \xc5\x9aatayus and Vi\xc5\x9bwayus; and the Padma agrees with the Matsya.\n\n[398:2](vp099.htm#fr_1047) Son of Vijaya: Bhagavata. This line of princes is\nfollowed only in our text, the Vayu, Brahma, and Hari V., and the Bhagavata.\n\n[398:3](vp099.htm#fr_1048) Kanchanaprabha: Brahma.\n\n[398:4](vp099.htm#fr_1049) Hotraka: Bhagavata.\n\n[398:5](vp099.htm#fr_1050) The Brahma P. and Hari V. add of this prince, that\nhe was the husband of Kaveri, the daughter of Yuvana\xc5\x9bwa, who by the\nimprecation of her husband became the Kaveri river: another indication of the\nDakshina origin of these works. The p. 399 Hari V. has another Jahnu, to whom\nit gives the same spouse, as we shall hereafter see.\n\n[399:6](vp099.htm#fr_1051) Sunuta: Brahma. Puru: Bhagavata.\n\n[399:7](vp099.htm#fr_1052) Valaka: Brahma. Ajaka: Bhagavata.\n\n[399:8](vp099.htm#fr_1053) The Brahma P. and Hari V. add that Ku\xc5\x9ba was in\nalliance with the Pahlavas and foresters.\n\n[399:9](vp099.htm#fr_1054) Our authorities differ as to these names:\n\nVayu.\n\n|\n\nBrahma and Hari V.\n\n|\n\nBhagavata.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nKu\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa or,  \nKu\xc5\x9basthamba\n\n|\n\nKu\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa\n\n|\n\nKu\xc5\x9bamba  \n  \nKu\xc5\x9banabha\n\n|\n\nKu\xc5\x9banabha\n\n|\n\nKu\xc5\x9banabha  \n  \nAmurttarayasa\n\n|\n\nAmurttimat\n\n|\n\nAmurttaraya  \n  \nVasu\n\n|\n\nKu\xc5\x9bika\n\n|\n\nVasu.  \n  \n[paragraph continues] The Ramayan\xcc\x81a has Ku\xc5\x9bamba, Ku\xc5\x9banabha, Amurttarayasa, and\nVasu; and makes them severally the founders of Kau\xc5\x9bambi, of Mahodaya (which\nafterwards appears the same as Kanoj), Dharmaran\xcc\x81ya, and Girivraja; the latter\nbeing in the mountainous part of Magadha. I. s. 29.\n\n[399:10](vp099.htm#fr_1055) The Brahma and Hari V. make Gadhi the son of\nKu\xc5\x9bika; the Vayu and Bhagavata, of Ku\xc5\x9banaba; the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, of Ku\xc5\x9banabha.\n\n[399:11](vp099.htm#fr_1056) The Ramayan\xcc\x81a notices the marriage, but has no\nlegend. The Mahabharata, Vans P., has a rather more detailed narration, but\nmuch the same as in the text. According to the commentator, A\xc5\x9bwatirtha is in\nthe district of Kanoj; perhaps at the confluence of the Kalanadi with the\nGanges. The agency of the god of Ocean in procuring horses, is a rather\ncurious additional coincidence between Varun\xcc\x81a and Neptune.\n\n[399:12](vp099.htm#fr_1057) In the Mahabharata, Bhrigu, the father of Richika,\nprepares the Charu.\n\n[400:13](vp099.htm#fr_1058) So the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, after stating that Satyavati\nfollowed her husband in death, adds, that she became the Kau\xc5\x9biki river; the\nCosi, which, rising in Nepal, flows through Puraniya into the Ganges, opposite\nnearly to Rajamahal.\n\n[401:14](vp099.htm#fr_1059) The text omits the story of Para\xc5\x9burama, but as the\nlegend makes a great figure in the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava works in general, I have\ninserted it from the Mahabharata, where it is twice related, once in the Vana\nParva, and once in the Rajadharma section of the \xc5\x9aanti Parva. It is told also\nat length in the ninth book of the Bhagavata, in the Padma and Agni Puran\xcc\x81as,\n&c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Legend of Para\xc5\x9burama](vp100.htm)\n\n'
