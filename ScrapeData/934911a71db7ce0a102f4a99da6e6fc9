Felicity to me may Vinayaka grant!  \nFelicity to me may Sarasvati grant!  \nFelicity to me may Mahesvara grant!  \nFelicity to me may Sadasiva grant!\n\n#### The purpose of the Hymn.\n\n2\\. The sages hold that there is no greater gain. than the gain of Atman, the\nSelf. With a view to this gain, the sage adores his own Self, the Paramesvara.\n\n3\\. In this Hymn is adored the Paramesvara Himself, who, having entered into\nthe Universe created by His own will, manifests Himself in the mind of every\none.\n\np. 3\n\n#### The fundamental questions.\n\nAs a result of the accumulated good Karma of many past births, a man attains\nsome control over his mind, conceives a certain amount of indifference to\nworldly objects, obtains slight glimpses of truth, is able to discriminate the\nreal and permanent from the unreal and impermanent, and is led to a study of\nthe scriptures. After a cursory study of the scriptural teaching and of human\nexperience, he becomes the disciple of a Teacher and asks him the following\nquestions:\n\n4\\. _Question_ 1.--We speak of things as _existing_ and _appearing_. Wherein\ndoes this _existence_ abide, as also the _light_ by which they appear?\n\n5\\. Is it in the things themselves severally, or in Isvara, the very Self of\nall?\n\nThough the external phenomena themselves vary from moment to moment, the ideas\nof _being_ and _consciousness_ invariably associated with all of them do not\nvary. Hence the question as to\n\np. 4\n\nwherein they essentially abide. Do they inhere in each object separately like\nits specific size, etc., as it is quite natural to suppose that they abide\nwhere they are observed; or do they inhere in the one Isvara who is said to\nexist everywhere in the universe as the Self of all, like the genus in the\nindividuals, as the Sruti declares in the Isavasyopanishad, "By Lord is all\nthis to be dwelt in," no distinction being observed as to being and\nconsciousness in all objects of perception except what prevails among the\nindividual objects themselves?\n\n_Q_. 2.--What is Isvara?\n\nIs Isvara, the author of the universe, quite external to it? Or, does He form\nthe very basis wherein the universe has its being?\n\n_Q_. 3.--What is Jiva?\n\nIs it in the very nature of Pratyagatman to be Jiva? Or, is it accidental, due\nto His connection with an upadhi?\n\n_Q_. 4.--What is meant by "the Self of all?"\n\nIs the Isvara, as a matter of fact, the Self of all? Or, is He so described by\ncourtesy?\n\n6\\. _Q_. 5.--How has Jiva to understand it?\n\nWhat is the right knowledge of these things?\n\np. 5\n\n_Q_. 6.--What is the means to that knowledge?\n\n_Q_. 7.--What good accrues to him from the knowledge?\n\n_Q_. 8.--How can Jiva and Isvara be one?\n\n7\\. How can Atman, the Self, be the All-knower and All-doer? To the pupil thus\nasking, the Guru proceeds to say as follows.\n\nBeing mutually opposed in their nature, either they (Jiva and Isvara) are said\nto be one only by courtesy; or, if they be one in reality, they are mutually\nopposed only in appearance. Which of these alternatives is meant here?\n\nIn answer to these questions, the Teacher chants this (Hymn to the Blessed\nDakshinamurti).\n\nThe meaning (of the first stanza) may be explained as follows:\n\n#### The Universe exists in the Self.\n\n8\\. All the things which we perceive exist here within (in our Self--the\nParamatman,\n\np. 6\n\nthe Highest Self). Within is the whole of this universe. By Maya it appears as\nexternal, like one\'s own body in a mirror.\n\n9\\. Just as in svapna (dream) the universe existing in one\'s own Self is seen\nas if it were external, so, be it known that even in the jagrat (waking) state\nthis universe exists within and yet appears to be external.\n\n10\\. It is certain that the existence of objects seen in svapna is not\nindependent of the existence of one\'s own Self. What difference is there in\nthe objects of jagrat consciousness, impermanent and insentient (jada) as they\nalways are?\n\n#### The Universe shines by the light of the Self.\n\np. 7\n\n11\\. In svapna, things appear by the light of one\'s own Self. There is then\nindeed no other light. The wise have concluded that the case is just the same\neven in jagrat.\n\n#### Realisation of Non-duality.\n\n12\\. Just as, when awake, a man sees not the things which were presented to\nhis view during sleep, so, subsequently to the rise of right knowledge, he\nsees not the universe.\n\n13\\. "When Jiva is awakened from the sleep of delusion which has no beginning,\nthen does he realise the Unborn, the Sleepless, the Dreamless, the One without\na second." ( _Gaudapadacharya\'s Karikas on the Mandukya Upanishad_ , i. 16).\n\np. 8\n\n14-15\\. When, by Sruti, by the master\'s favour, by practice of Yoga, and by\nthe Grace of God, there arises a knowledge of one\'s own Self, then, as a man\nregards the food he has eaten as one with himself, the Adept Yogin sees the\nuniverse as one with his Self, absorbed as the universe is in the Universal\nEgo which he has become.\n\nThus far has the first stanza been literally interpreted. Now the Vartikakara\nproceeds to develop answers to other questions. First he shows, on the analogy\nof svapna, how by Maya the one conscious Atman becomes Isvara and Jiva:\n\n#### Atman as Isvara and Jiva.\n\n16\\. Just as in svapna a man becomes a king, enjoys all the pleasures that can\nbe wished for, conquers the enemy in the battle-field with the aid of a well-\nequipped army;\n\np. 9\n\nThat is to say, like a man who in svapna regards himself to be an independent\nking, the Chidatman, the self-conscious Self, becomes Isvara, having subjected\nall external beings to his own control, and regarding Himself as the\nindependent Lord of them all. Similarly, the Jiva state of the Atman is\nillustrated as follows:\n\n17\\. then being defeated by the enemy, he goes to the forest and practises\npenance; in one short hour, he imagines himself to have lived for a long\nperiod;\n\nThat is to say, Atman is regarded as Jiva when he is under the control of\nanother, and seeks unattained objects of desire.\n\n18\\. so also, in jagrat state, he imagines a fancied world of his own; he is\nnot aware of life coming to an end in the swift current of Time.\n\np. 10\n\n19\\. Like the sun veiled by the cloud, Paramesvara, the Supreme Lord Himself,\nquite deluded by Maya, appears to be of limited power and limited knowledge.\n\nIsvara is Himself called Jiva when subject to the control of Maya. There is no\nindependent entity called Jiva.\n\n20\\. Whenever one does or knows a thing independently by one\'s own power, it\nis then that Paramesvara is said to be a king, a sage, a lord.\n\nThus the question as to what is meant by Isvara and Jiva has been answered.\nAtman becomes Isvara and Jiva by Maya. He is said to be Jiva or Paramesvara\nunder certain conditions, but not in Himself.\n\n#### Isvara is the Self in all.\n\n21\\. All Jivas are endued with intelligence and activity, because they are one\nwith Siva. Because Jivas are endued with\n\np. 11\n\nthe powers of Isvara, we may conclude that they are (identical with) Isvara.\n\nIntelligence [and](errata.htm#11) activity, _jnana_ and _kriya_ , are found\nassociated with Jivas because these are identical with Siva, the Paramatman\nwho alone has the power of knowing and acting quite independently of all. A\nmass of iron is said to burn only when regarded as identical with the fire\nburning in it. All Jivas being thus identical with Isvara, He is said to be\nSarvatman, the Self in all.\n\n#### Isvara\'s consciousness is one and self-luminous.\n\n22\\. In all our cognitions of external objects, such as are expressed in the\nwords \'this is a pot,\' \'this is a cloth,\' it is the consciousness, forming the\nvery nature of the Self, which manifests of itself, like the sun\'s light.\n\n23\\. If consciousness were not self-manifested, then the universe would be\nblind darkness.\n\np. 12\n\n#### Isvara\'s activity.\n\nIf there be no activity whatever in Him, how can any one be spoken of as the\ndoer of an act?\n\nThough formless, Isvara must possess activity inherent in Him, inasmuch as He\nis spoken of as the Creator, etc. What sort of activity it is, is explained in\nthe next verse:\n\n24\\. Activity, which is either motion or change of condition, becomes\nmanifested as an offshoot of consciousness moving towards the external.\n\nThe sort of activity here defined is possible even in the formless Being when\nassociated with an upadhi. When consciousness is in a state of motion as it\nwere, when it is associated with manas set vibrating by the sense-organs\ncoming in contact with sense-objects, then, as an effect thereof, the prana\nwhich is inseparable from the manas wherein consciousness abides is thrown\ninto a state of vibration which expresses itself as some form of activity in\nthe physical body ensouled by the prana. Thus the activity of prana, etc.,\nbeing\n\np. 13\n\ndependent on the presence of the indwelling Controller, the Isvara, all\nactivity seen in any being whatsoever pertains to none other than the Isvara.\n( _Vide_ Chap. IV., 7-8).\n\nThus far activity manifested in the form of vibration has been illustrated.\nIts manifestation as change of condition is shown as follows:\n\n25\\. Activity manifests itself in connection with a thing to be produced, or\nreached, or ceremonially regenerated, or modified in form; as when we say, he\nmakes a thing, he goes to a place, he wipes off a sacrificial twig, he cuts a\ntwig asunder.\n\n#### Isvara and Jiva differentiated by Upadhi.\n\nNow he proceeds to show that Omniscience and finite knowledge pertain to the\nOne alone according to the upadhi with which He is associated:\n\np. 14\n\n26-27\\. Siva manifests Himself as the Omniscient in the bodies of Brahma and\nthe like; and in Devas, lower animals and man, He manifests Himself with a\nfinite knowledge of various degrees. There are four kinds of bodies, the womb-\nborn, the egg-born, the sweat-born, and the earth-born,--arranged in their\ndescending order.\n\n#### All differentiation is due to Maya.\n\n28\\. When the Paramatman of infinite light is intuitively realized, all\ncreatures from Brahma down to the lowest plant melt into an illusion like unto\na dream.\n\n29\\. Vedas speak of Him as smaller than an atom and greater than the great;\nand the Rudra-Upanishad, too, extols Siva as the Sarvatman, the Self of all.\n\np. 15\n\n30\\. To Him who is manifested in the different forms as Isvara, as the\nTeacher, as the Self; who is all pervading like unto ether; to Sri-\nDakshinamurti,--to the Effulgent Form Facing the South; to Him (Siva) be this\nbow!\n\nTo bow to the Supreme Lord means to offer one\'s own Self to Him in the thought\nthat the two are one and identical. The term \'Dakshinamurti\' is variously\nexplained: (1) it is applied to a special incarnation of Siva in the form of a\nTeacher, who, seated at the foot of a fig-tree with His face towards the\nsouth, is engaged in imparting spiritual instruction to the highest sages of\nthe world such as Sanaka. (2) It is applied to Siva who, in His mighty form\ncomposed of Existence, Intelligence and Bliss, and with His beginningless and\nunthinkable power of Maya, can create, preserve and destroy the universe, and\nyet who has really no form whatever. (3) Siva is so called because the\nspiritual wisdom forms the only means by which He can be known and realised.\n\np. 16\n\n31\\. Thus ends the first chapter in brief in the work called Manasollasa\nexpounding the meaning of the Hymn to the Blessed Dakshinamurti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II.
