O Warrior thou, and show  \nWhat soldier can, 'gainst Brahman foe.  \nO Gadhi's son, thy days are told;  \nThy pride is tamed, thy dart is cold.  \nHow shall a warrior's puissance dare  \nWith Brahman's awful strength compare?  \nTo-day, base Warrior, shall thou feel  \nThat God-sent might is more than steel.'  \nHe raised his Brahman staff, nor missed  \nThe fiery dart that near him hissed:  \nAnd quenched the fearful weapon fell,  \nAs flame beneath the billow's swell.  \n\nThen Gadhi's son in fury threw  \nLord Varun's arm and Rudra's too:  \nIndra's fierce bolt that all destroys;  \nThat which the Lord of Herds employs:  \nThe Human, that which minstrels Keep,  \nThe deadly Lure, the endless Sleep:  \nThe Yawner, and the dart which charms;  \nLament and Torture, fearful arms:  \nThe Terrible, the dart which dries,  \nThe Thunderbolt which quenchless flies,  \nAnd Fate's dread net, and Brahma's noose,  \nAnd that which waits for Varun's use:  \nThe dart he loves who wields the bow  \nPinaka, and twin bolts that glow  \nWith fury as they flash and fly,  \nThe quenchless Liquid and the Dry:  \nThe dart of Vengeance, swift to kill:  \nThe Goblins' dart, the Curlew's Bill:  \n\np. 68  \n\nThe discus both of Fate and Right,  \nAnd Vishnu's, of unerring flight:  \nThe Wind-God's dart, the Troubler dread,  \nThe weapon named the Horse's Head.  \nFrom his fierce hand two spears were thrown,  \nAnd the great mace that smashes bone;  \nThe dart of spirits of the air,  \nAnd that which Fate exults to bear;  \nThe Trident dart which slaughters foes,  \nAnd that which hanging skulls compose: 1  \nThese fearful darts in fiery rain  \nHe hurled upon the saint amain,  \nAn awful miracle to view.  \nBut as the ceaseless tempest flew,  \nThe sage with wand of God-sent power  \nStill swallowed up that fiery shower.  \n\nThen Gadhi's son, when these had failed,  \nWith Brahma's dart his foe assailed.  \nThe Gods, with Indra at their head,  \nAnd Nagas, quailed disquieted,  \nAnd saints and minstrels, when they saw  \nThe king that awful weapon draw;  \nAnd the three worlds were filled with dread,  \nAnd trembled as the missile sped.  \n\nThe saint, with Brahman wand, empowered  \nBy lore divine that dart devoured.  \nNor could the triple world withdraw  \nRapt gazes from that sight of awe;  \nFor as be swallowed down the dart  \nOf Brahma, sparks from every part,  \nFrom finest pore and hair-cell, broke  \nEnveloped in a veil of smoke.  \nThe staff he waved was all aglow  \nLike Yama's sceptre, King below,  \nOr like the lurid fire of Fate  \nWhose rage the worlds will desolate.  \n\nThe hermits, whom that sight had awed,  \nExtolled the saint, with hymn and laud:  \n'Thy power, O Sage, is ne'er in vain:  \nNow with thy might thy might restrain.  \nBe gracious, Master, and allow  \n\nThe worlds to rest from trouble now;  \nFor Vis'vamitra, strong and dread,  \nBy thee has been discomfited.'  \n\nThen, thus addressed, the saint, well pleased.  \nThe fury of his wrath appeased.  \nThe king, o'erpowered and ashamed,  \nWith many a deep-drawn sigh exclaimed:  \n'Ah! Warriors' strength is poor and slight;  \nA Brahman's power is truly might.  \nThis Brahman staff the hermit held  \nThe fury of my darts has quelled.  \nThis truth within my heart impressed,  \nWith senses ruled and tranquil breast  \nMy task austere will I begin,  \nAnd Brahmanhood will strive to win.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[68:1](ry056.htm#fr_233) 'The names of many of these weapons which are\nmythical and partly allegorical have occurred in Canto XXIX. The general\nsignification of the story is clear enough. It is a contest for supremacy\nbetween the regal or military order and Brahmanical or priestly authority,\nlike one of those struggles which our own Europe saw in the middle ages when\nwithout employing warlike weapons the priesthood frequently gained the\nvictory.'
