He was a\nvery pious man, in the constant habit of performing penance and worship upon\nthe river Sidi. He modelled his own clay images instead of buying them from\nothers; he painted holy stones red at the top, and made to them offerings of\nflowers, fruit, water, sweetmeats, and fried peas. He had become a learned man\nsomewhat late in life, having, until twenty years old, neglected his reading,\nand addicted himself to worshipping the beautiful youth Kama-Deva[116] and\nRati his wife, accompanied by the cuckoo, the humming-bee, and sweet breezes.\n\nOne day his parents having rebuked him sharply for his ungovernable conduct,\nKeshav wandered to a neighbouring hamlet, and hid himself in the tall fig-tree\nwhich shadowed a celebrated image of Panchanan.[117] Presently an evil thought\narose in his head: he defiled the god, and threw him into the nearest tank.\n\nThe next morning, when the person arrived whose livelihood depended on the\nimage, he discovered that his god was gone. He returned into the village\ndistracted, and all was soon in an uproar about the lost deity.\n\nIn the midst of this confusion the parents of Keshav arrived, seeking for\ntheir son; and a man in the crowd declared that he had seen a young man\nsitting in Panchanan\'s tree, but what had become of the god he knew not.\n\nThe runaway at length appeared, and the suspicions of the villagers fell upon\nhim as the stealer of Panchanan. He confessed the fact, pointed out the place\nwhere he had thrown the stone, and added that he had polluted the god. All\nhands and eyes were raised in amazement at this atrocious crime, and every one\npresent declared that Panchanan would certainly punish the daring insult by\nimmediate death. Keshav was dreadfully frightened; he began to obey his\nparents from that very hour, and applied to his studies so sedulously that he\nsoon became the most learned man of his country.\n\nNow Keshav the Brahman had a daughter whose name was the Madhumalati or Sweet\nJasmine. She was very beautiful. Whence did the gods procure the materials to\nform so exquisite a face? They took a portion of the most excellent part of\nthe moon to form that beautiful face? Does any one seek a proof of this? Let\nhim look at the empty places left in the moon. Her eyes resembled the full-\nblown blue nymphaea; her arms the charming stalk of the lotus; her flowing\ntresses the thick darkness of night.\n\nWhen this lovely person arrived at a marriageable age, her mother, father, and\nbrother, all three became very anxious about her. For the wise have said, "A\ndaughter nubile but without a husband is ever a calamity hanging over a\nhouse." And, "Kings, women, and climbing plants love those who are near them."\nAlso, "Who is there that has not suffered from the sex? for a woman cannot be\nkept in due subjection, either by gifts or kindness, or correct conduct, or\nthe greatest services, or the laws of morality, or by the terror of\npunishment, for she cannot discriminate between good and evil."\n\nIt so happened that one day Keshav the Brahman went to the marriage of a\ncertain customer of his,[118] and his son repaired to the house of a spiritual\npreceptor in order to read. During their absence, a young man came to the\nhouse, when the Sweet Jasmine\'s mother, inferring his good qualities from his\ngood looks, said to him, "I will give to thee my daughter in marriage." The\nfather also had promised his daughter to a Brahman youth whom he had met at\nthe house of his employer; and the brother likewise had betrothed his sister\nto a fellow student at the place where he had gone to read.\n\nAfter some days father and son came home, accompanied by these two suitors,\nand in the house a third was already seated. The name of the first was\nTribikram, of the second Baman, and of the third Madhusadan. The three were\nequal in mind and body, in knowledge, and in age.\n\nThen the father, looking upon them, said to himself, "Ho! there is one bride\nand three bridegrooms; to whom shall I give, and to whom shall I not give? We\nthree have pledged our word to these three. A strange circumstance has\noccurred; what must we do?"\n\nHe then proposed to them a trial of wisdom, and made them agree that he who\nshould quote the most excellent saying of the wise should become his\ndaughter\'s husband.\n\nQuoth Tribikram: "Courage is tried in war; integrity in the payment of debt\nand interest; friendship in distress; and the faithfulness of a wife in the\nday of poverty."\n\nBaman proceeded: "That woman is destitute of virtue who in her father\'s house\nis not in subjection, who wanders to feasts and amusements, who throws off her\nveil in the presence of men, who remains as a guest in the houses of\nstrangers, who is much devoted to sleep, who drinks inebriating beverages, and\nwho delights in distance from her husband."\n\n"Let none," pursued Madhusadan, "confide in the sea, nor in whatever has claws\nor horns, or who carries deadly weapons; neither in a woman, nor in a king."\n\nWhilst the Brahman was doubting which to prefer, and rather inclining to the\nlatter sentiment, a serpent bit the beautiful girl, and in a few hours she\ndied.\n\nStunned by this awful sudden death, the father and the three suitors sat for a\ntime motionless. They then arose, used great exertions, and brought all kinds\nof sorcerers, wise men and women who charm away poisons by incantations. These\nhaving seen the girl said, "She cannot return to life." The first declared, "A\nperson always dies who has been bitten by a snake on the fifth, sixth, eighth,\nninth, and fourteenth days of the lunar month.\'\' The second asserted, "One who\nhas been bitten on a Saturday or a Tuesday does not survive." The third\nopined, "Poison infused during certain six lunar mansions cannot be got\nunder." Quoth the fourth, "One who has been bitten in any organ of sense, the\nlower lip, the cheek, the neck, or the stomach, cannot escape death." The\nfifth said, "In this case even Brahma, the Creator, could not restore life--of\nwhat account, then, are we? Do you perform the funeral rites; we will depart."\n\nThus saying, the sorcerers went their way. The mourning father took up his\ndaughter\'s corpse and caused it to be burnt, in the place where dead bodies\nare usually burnt, and returned to his house.\n\nAfter that the three young men said to one another, "We must now seek\nhappiness elsewhere. And what better can we do than obey the words of Indra,\nthe God of Air, who spake thus ?--\n\n"\'For a man who does not travel about there is no felicity, and a good man who\nstays at home is a bad man. Indra is the friend of him who travels. Travel!\n\n"\'A traveller\'s legs are like blossoming branches, and he himself grows and\ngathers the fruit. All his wrongs vanish, destroyed by his exertion on the\nroadside. Travel!\n\n"\'The fortune of a man who sits, sits also; it rises when he rises; it sleeps\nwhen he sleeps; it moves well when he moves. Travel!\n\n"\'A man who sleeps is like the Iron Age. A man who awakes is like the Bronze\nAge. A man who rises up is like the Silver Age. A man who travels is like the\nGolden Age. Travel!\n\n"\'A traveller finds honey; a traveller finds sweet figs. Look at the happiness\nof the sun, who travailing never tires. Travel!"\'\n\nBefore parting they divided the relics of the beloved one, and then they went\ntheir way.\n\nTribikram, having separated and tied up the burnt bones, became one of the\nVaisheshikas, in those days a powerful sect. He solemnly forswore the eight\ngreat crimes, namely: feeding at night; slaying any animal; eating the fruit\nof trees that give milk, or pumpkins or young bamboos: tasting honey or flesh;\nplundering the wealth of others; taking by force a married woman; eating\nflowers, butter, or cheese; and worshipping the gods of other religions. He\nlearned that the highest act of virtue is to abstain from doing injury to\nsentient creatures; that crime does not justify the destruction of life; and\nthat kings, as the administrators of criminal justice, are the greatest of\nsinners. He professed the five vows of total abstinence from falsehood, eating\nflesh or fish, theft, drinking spirits, and marriage. He bound himself to\npossess nothing beyond a white loin-cloth, a towel to wipe the mouth, a\nbeggar\'s dish, and a brush of woollen threads to sweep the ground for fear of\ntreading on insects. And he was ordered to fear secular affairs; the miseries\nof a future state; the receiving from others more than the food of a day at\nonce; all accidents; provisions, if connected with the destruction of animal\nlife; death and disgrace; also to please all, and to obtain compassion from\nall.\n\nHe attempted to banish his love. He said to himself, "Surely it was owing only\nto my pride and selfishness that I ever looked upon a woman as capable of\naffording happiness; and I thought, \'Ah! ah! thine eyes roll about like the\ntail of the water-wagtail, thy lips resemble the ripe fruit, thy bosom is like\nthe lotus bud, thy form is resplendent as gold melted in a crucible, the moon\nwanes through desire to imitate the shadow of thy face, thou resemblest the\npleasure-house of Cupid; the happiness of all time is concentrated in thee; a\ntouch from thee would surely give life to a dead image; at thy approach a\nliving admirer would be changed by joy into a lifeless stone; obtaining thee I\ncan face all the horrors of war; and were I pierced by showers of arrows, one\nglance of thee would heal all my wounds.\'\n\n"My mind is now averted from the world. Seeing her I say, \'Is this the form by\nwhich men are bewitched? This is a basket covered with skin; it contains\nbones, flesh, blood, and impurities. The stupid creature who is captivated by\nthis--is there a cannibal feeding in Currim a greater cannibal than he? These\npersons call a thing made up of impure matter a face, and drink its charms as\na drunkard swallows the inebriating liquor from his cup. The blind, infatuated\nbeings! Why should I be pleased or displeased with this body, composed of\nflesh and blood? It is my duty to seek Him who is the Lord of this body, and\nto disregard everything which gives rise either to pleasure or to pain.\'"\n\nBaman, the second suitor, tied up a bundle of his beloved one\'s ashes, and\nfollowed--somewhat prematurely--the precepts of the great lawgiver Manu. "When\nthe father of a family perceives his muscles becoming flaccid, and his hair\ngrey, and sees the child of his child, let him then take refuge in a forest.\nLet him take up his consecrated fire and all his domestic implements for\nmaking oblations to it, and, departing from the town to the lonely wood, let\nhim dwell in it with complete power over his organs of sense and of action.\nWith many sorts of pure food, such as holy sages used to eat, with green\nherbs, roots, and fruit, let him perform the five great sacraments,\nintroducing them with due ceremonies. Let him wear a black antelope-hide, or a\nvesture of bark; let him bathe evening and morning; let him suffer the hair of\nhis head, his beard and his nails to grow continually. Let him slide backwards\nand forwards on the ground; or let him stand a whole day on tiptoe; or let him\ncontinue in motion, rising and sitting alternately; but at sunrise, at noon,\nand at sunset, let him go to the waters and bathe In the hot season let him\nsit exposed to five fires, four blazing around him, with the sun above; in the\nrains let him stand uncovered, without even a mantle, where the clouds pour\nthe heaviest showers; in the cold season let him wear damp clothes, and let\nhim increase by degrees the austerity of his devotions. Then, having reposited\nhis holy fires, as the law directs, in his mind, let him live without external\nfire, without a mansion, wholly silent, feeding on roots and fruit."\n\nMeanwhile Madhusadan the third, having taken a wallet and neckband, became a\nJogi, and began to wander far and wide, living on nothing but chaff, and\npracticing his devotions. In order to see Brahma he attended to the following\nduties; 1. Hearing; 2. Meditation; 3. Fixing the Mind; 4. Absorbing the Mind.\nHe combated the three evils, restlessness, injuriousness, voluptuousness by\nsettling the Deity in his spirit, by subjecting his senses, and by destroying\ndesire. Thus he would do away with the illusion (Maya) which conceals all true\nknowledge. He repeated the name of the Deity till it appeared to him in the\nform of a Dry Light or glory. Though connected with the affairs of life, that\nis, with affairs belonging to a body containing blood, bones, and impurities;\nto organs which are blind, palsied, and full of weakness and error; to a mind\nfilled with thirst, hunger, sorrow, infatuation; to confirmed habits, and to\nthe fruits of former births: still he strove not to view these things as\nrealities. He made a companion of a dog, honouring it with his own food, so as\nthe better to think on spirit. He practiced all the five operations connected\nwith the vital air, or air collected in the body. He attended much to\nPranayama, or the gradual suppression of breathing, and he secured fixedness\nof mind as follows. By placing his sight and thoughts on the tip of his nose\nhe perceived smell; on the tip of his tongue he realized taste, on the root of\nhis tongue he knew sound, and so forth. He practiced the eighty-four Asana or\npostures, raising his hand to the wonders of the heavens, till he felt no\nlonger the inconveniences of heat or cold, hunger or thirst. He particularly\npreferred the Padma or lotus-posture, which consists of bringing the feet to\nthe sides, holding the right in the left hand and the left in the right. In\nthe work of suppressing his breath he permitted its respiration to reach at\nfurthest twelve fingers\' breadth, and gradually diminished the distance from\nhis nostrils till he could confine it to the length of twelve fingers from his\nnose, and even after restraining it for some time he would draw it from no\ngreater distance than from his heart. As respects time, he began by retaining\ninspiration for twenty-six seconds, and he enlarged this period gradually till\nhe became perfect. He sat cross-legged, closing with his fingers all the\navenues of inspiration, and he practiced Prityahara, or the power of\nrestraining the members of the body and mind, with meditation and\nconcentration, to which there are four enemies, viz., a sleepy heart, human\npassions, a confused mind, and attachment to anything but the one Brahma. He\nalso cultivated Yama, that is, inoffensiveness, truth, honesty, the forsaking\nof all evil in the world, and the refusal of gifts except for sacrifice, and\nNihama, i.e., purity relative to the use of water after defilement, pleasure\nin everything whether in prosperity or adversity, renouncing food when hungry,\nand keeping down the body. Thus delivered from these four enemies of the\nflesh, he resembled the unruffled flame of the lamp, and by Brahmagnana, or\nmeditating on the Deity, placing his mind on the sun, moon, fire, or any other\nluminous body, or within his heart, or at the bottom of his throat, or in the\ncentre of his skull, he was enabled to ascend from gross images of omnipotence\nto the works and the divine wisdom of the glorious original.\n\nOne day Madhusadan, the Jogi, went to a certain house for food, and the\nhouseholder having seen him began to say, "Be so good as to take your food\nhere this day!" The visitor sat down, and when the victuals were ready, the\nhost caused his feet and hands to be washed, and leading him to the Chauka, or\nsquare place upon which meals are served, seated him and sat by him. And he\nquoted the scripture: "No guest must be dismissed in the evening by a\nhousekeeper: he is sent by the returning sun, and whether he come in fit\nseason or unseasonably, he must not sojourn in the house without\nentertainment: let me not eat any delicate food, without asking my guest to\npartake of it: the satisfaction of a guest will assuredly bring the\nhousekeeper wealth, reputation, long life, and a place in heaven."\n\nThe householder\'s wife then came to serve up the food, rice and split peas,\noil, and spices, all cooked in a new earthen pot with pure firewood. Part of\nthe meal was served and the rest remained to be served, when the woman\'s\nlittle child began to cry aloud and to catch hold of its mother\'s dress. She\nendeavoured to release herself, but the boy would not let go, and the more she\ncoaxed the more he cried, and was obstinate. On this the mother became angry,\ntook up the boy and threw him upon the fire, which instantly burnt him to\nashes.\n\nMadhusadan, the Jogi, seeing this, rose up without eating. The master of the\nhouse said to him, "Why eatest thou not?" He replied, "I am \' Atithi,\' that is\nto say, to be entertained at your house, but how can one eat under the roof of\na person who has committed such a Rakshasa-like (devilish) deed? Is it not\nsaid, \'He who does not govern his passions, lives in vain\'? \'A foolish king, a\nperson puffed up with riches, and a weak child, desire that which cannot be\nprocured\'? Also, \'A king destroys his enemies, even when flying; and the touch\nof an elephant, as well as the breath of a serpent, are fatal; but the wicked\ndestroy even while laughing\'?"\n\nHearing this, the householder smiled; presently he arose and went to another\npart of the tenement, and brought back with him a book, treating on\nSanjivnividya, or the science of restoring the dead to life. This he had taken\nfrom its hidden place, two beams almost touching one another with the ends in\nthe opposite wall. The precious volume was in single leaves, some six inches\nbroad by treble that length, and the paper was stained with yellow orpiment\nand the juice of tamarind seeds to keep away insects.\n\nThe householder opened the cloth containing the book, untied the flat boards\nat the top and bottom, and took out from it a charm. Having repeated this\nMantra, with many ceremonies, he at once restored the child to life, saying,\n"Of all precious things, knowledge is the most valuable; other riches may be\nstolen, or diminished by expenditure, but knowledge is immortal, and the\ngreater the expenditure the greater the increase; it can be shared with none,\nand it defies the power of the thief."\n\nThe Jogi, seeing this marvel, took thought in his heart, "If I could obtain\nthat book, I would restore my beloved to life, and give up this course of\nuncomfortable postures and difficulty of breathing." With this resolution he\nsat down to his food, and remained in the house.\n\nAt length night came, and after a time, all, having eaten supper, and gone to\ntheir sleeping-places, lay down. The Jogi also went to rest in one part of the\nhouse, but did not allow sleep to close his eyes. When he thought that a\nfourth part of the hours of darkness had sped, and that all were deep in\nslumber, then he got up very quietly, and going into the room of the master of\nthe house, he took down the book from the beam-ends and went his ways.\n\nMadhusadan, the Jogi, went straight to the place where the beautiful Sweet\nJasmine had been burned. There he found his two rivals sitting talking\ntogether and comparing experiences. They recognized him at once, and cried\naloud to him, "Brother! thou also hast been wandering over the world; tell us\nthis--hast thou learned anything which can profit us?" He replied, "I have\nlearned the science of restoring the dead to life"; upon which they both\nexclaimed, "If thou hast really learned such knowledge, restore our beloved to\nlife."\n\nMadhusadan proceeded to make his incantations, despite terrible sights in the\nair, the cries of jackals, owls, crows, cats, asses, vultures, dogs, and\nlizards, and the wrath of innumerable invisible beings, such as messengers of\nYama (Pluto), ghosts, devils, demons, imps, fiends, devas, succubi, and\nothers. All the three lovers drawing blood from their own bodies, offered it\nto the goddess Chandi, repeating the following incantation, "Hail! supreme\ndelusion! Hail! goddess of the universe! Hail! thou who fulfillest the desires\nof all. May I presume to offer thee the blood of my body; and wilt thou deign\nto accept it, and be propitious towards me!"\n\nThey then made a burnt-offering of their flesh, and each one prayed, "Grant\nme, O goddess! to see the maiden alive again, in proportion to the fervency\nwith which I present thee with mine own flesh, invoking thee to be propitious\nto me. Salutation to thee again and again, under the mysterious syllables any!\nany!"\n\nThen they made a heap of the bones and the ashes, which had been carefully\nkept by Tribikram and Baman. As the Jogi Madhusadan proceeded with his\nincantation, a white vapour arose from the ground, and, gradually condensing,\nassumed a perispiritual form--the fluid envelope of the soul. The three\nspectators felt their blood freeze as the bones and the ashes were gradually\nabsorbed into the before shadowy shape, and they were restored to themselves\nonly when the maiden Madhuvati begged to be taken home to her mother.\n\nThen Kama, God of Love, blinded them, and they began fiercely to quarrel about\nwho should have the beautiful maid. Each wanted to be her sole master.\nTribikram declared the bones to be the great fact of the incantation; Baman\nswore by the ashes; and Madhusadan laughed them both to scorn. No one could\ndecide the dispute; the wisest doctors were all nonplussed; and as for the\nRaja--well! we do not go for wit or wisdom to kings. I wonder if the great\nRaja Vikram could decide which person the woman belonged to?\n\n"To Baman, the man who kept her ashes, fellow!" exclaimed the hero, not a\nlittle offended by the free remarks of the fiend.\n\n"Yet," rejoined the Baital impudently, "if Tribikram had not preserved her\nbones how could she have been restored to life? And if Madhusadan had not\nlearned the science of restoring the dead to life how could she have been\nrevivified? At least, so it seems to me. But perhaps your royal wisdom may\nexplain."\n\n"Devil!" said the king angrily, "Tribikram, who preserved her bones, by that\nact placed himself in the position of her son; therefore he could not marry\nher. Madhusadan, who, restoring her to life, gave her life, was evidently a\nfather to her; he could not, then, become her husband. Therefore she was the\nwife of Baman, who had collected her ashes."\n\n"I am happy to see, O king," exclaimed the Vampire, "that in spite of my\npresentiments, we are not to part company just yet. These little trips I hold\nto be, like lovers\' quarrels, the prelude to closer union. With your leave we\nwill still practice a little suspension."\n\nAnd so saying, the Baital again ascended the tree, and was suspended there.\n\n"Would it not be better," thought the monarch, after recapturing and\nshouldering the fugitive, "for me to sit down this time and listen to the\nfellow\'s story? Perhaps the double exercise of walking and thinking confuses\nme."\n\nWith this idea Vikram placed his bundle upon the ground, well tied up with\nturband and waistband; then he seated himself cross-legged before it, and bade\nhis son do the same.\n\nThe Vampire strongly objected to this measure, as it was contrary, he\nasserted, to the covenant between him and the Raja. Vikram replied by citing\nthe very words of the agreement, proving that there was no allusion to walking\nor sitting.\n\nThen the Baital became sulky, and swore that he would not utter another word.\nBut he, too, was bound by the chain of destiny. Presently he opened his lips,\nwith the normal prelude that he was about to tell a true tale.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vampire\'s Seventh Story.
