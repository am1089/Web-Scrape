And he shall take the foot of a bed instead of a staff and, proclaiming\nthe name of his deed, he shall go about (saying), 'Who (gives) alms to the\nmurderer of a Bhru _n_ a?' Obtaining thus his livelihood in the village, he\nshall dwell in an empty house or under a tree, (knowing that) he is not\nallowed to have intercourse with Aryans. According to this rule he shall act\nuntil his last breath. He cannot be purified in this world. But (after death)\nhis sin is taken away.\n\n2\\. He even who slays unintentionally, reaps nevertheless the result of his\nsin.\n\n3\\. (His guilt is) greater, (if he slays) intentionally.\n\n4\\. The same (principle applies) also to other sinful actions,\n\n5\\. And also to good works. 5\n\n6\\. A Brahma _n_ a shall not take a weapon into his hand, though he be only\ndesirous of examining it.\n\n7\\. In a Pura _n_ a (it has been declared), that he who\n\np. 91\n\nslays an assailant does not sin, for (in that case) wrath meets wrath.\n\n8\\. But Abhi _s_ astas shall live together in dwellings (outside the village);\nconsidering this their lawful (mode of life), they shall sacrifice for each\nother, teach each other, and marry amongst each other.\n\n9\\. If they have begot sons, let them. say to them: 'Go out from amongst us,\nfor thus the \xc3\x82ryas, (throwing the guilt) upon us, will receive you (amongst\ntheir number).' 9\n\n10\\. For the organs do not become impure together with the man.\n\n11\\. (The truth of) that may be learned from this (parallel case); a man\ndeficient in limbs begets a son who possesses the full number of limbs. 11\n\n12\\. Harita declares that this is wrong.\n\n13\\. A wife is similar to the vessel which contains the curds (for the\nsacrifice). 13\n\n14\\. For if one makes impure milk curdle (by mixing it with whey and water) in\na milk-vessel and stirs it, no sacrificial rite can be performed with (the\ncurds produced from) that. Just so no intercourse\n\np. 92\n\ncan be allowed with the impure seed which comes (from an Abhi _s_ asta).\n\n15\\. Sorcery and curses (employed against a Brahma _n_ a) cause a man to\nbecome impure, but not loss of caste.\n\n16\\. Harita declares that they cause loss of caste.\n\n17\\. But crimes causing impurity must be expiated, (when no particular penance\nis prescribed,) by performing the penance enjoined for crimes causing loss of\ncaste during twelve months, or twelve half months, or twelve twelve-nights, or\ntwelve se'nnights, or twelve times three days, or twelve days, or seven days,\nor three days, or one day.\n\n18\\. Thus acts causing impurity must be expiated according to the manner in\nwhich the (sinful) act has been committed (whether intentionally or\nunintentionally).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[90:5](sbe0232.htm#fr_495) **29**. Haradatta gives, as an example, the case\nwhere a warrior saves the property of a traveller from thieves. If the\ntraveller turns out to be a Brahma _n_ a, and the warrior did not know his\ncaste before rescuing his property, his merit will be less than if he had\nrescued knowingly the property of a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[91:9](sbe0232.htm#fr_496) It is impossible to agree with Haradatta's\nexplanation of the words to be addressed by Abhi _s_ astas to their children.\nNo Vedic license can excuse the use of the second person plural instead of the\nthird. I propose the following: 'Go out from among us; for thus (leaving the\nguilt) to us, you will be received (as) \xc3\x82ryas.' it is, however, not improbable\nthat our text is disfigured by several very old corruptions, compare\nBaudhayana II, 1, 2, 18.\n\n[91:11](sbe0232.htm#fr_497) 'In like manner a man who has lost his rights,\n(can) beget a son, who possesses the rights (of his caste). For the wife is\nalso a cause (of the birth of the son), and she is guiltless.'--Haradatta.\n\n[91:13](sbe0232.htm#fr_498) The statements now following are those with which\n\xc3\x82pastamba agrees. Those contained in Sutras 8-11 are merely the purvapaksha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 11, Kha _n_ _d_ a 30](sbe0233.htm)\n\n"
