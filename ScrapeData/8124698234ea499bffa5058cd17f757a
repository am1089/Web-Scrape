Vyasa said :-- O King Janamejaya! What is known in the S\xc2\x92rutis, in the\nSubala Upani _s_ ada, as the Sarvaloka over the Brahmaloka, that is Ma _n_\nidvipa. Here the Devi resides. This region is superior to all the other\nregions. Hence it is named \xc2\x93Sarvaloka.\xc2\x94 The Devi built this place of yore\naccording to Her will. In the very beginning, the Devi Mula Prakriti Bhagavati\nbuilt this place for Her residence, superior to Kailas\xc2\x92a, Vaiku _nt_ ha and\nGoloka. Verily no other place in this universe can stand before it. Hence it\nis called Ma _n_ idvipa or Sarvaloka as superior to all the Lokas. This Ma _n_\nidvipa is situated at the top of all the regions,\n\n\n\np. 1175\n\n\n\nand resembles an umbrella. Its shadow falls on the Brahma _nd_ a and destroys\nthe pains and sufferings of this world. Surrounding this Ma _n_ idvipa exists\nan ocean called the Sudha Samudra, many yojanas wide and many yojanas deep.\nMany waves arise in it due to winds. Various fishes and conches and other\naquatic animals play and here the beach is full of clear sand like gems. The\nsea-shores are kept always cool by the splashes of the waves of water striking\nthe beach. Various ships decked with various nice flags are plying to and fro.\nVarious trees bearing gems are adorning the beach. Across this ocean, there is\nan iron enclosure, very long and seven yojanas wide, very high so as to block\nthe Heavens. Within this enclosure wall the military guards skilled in war and\nfurnished with various weapons are running gladly to and fro. There are four\ngateways or entrances; at every gate there are hundreds of guards and various\nhosts of the devotees of the Devi. Whenever any Deva comes to pay a visit to\nthe Jagadis\xc2\x92vari, their Vahanas (carriers) and retinue are stopped here. O\nKing! This place is being resounded with the chimings of the bells of hundreds\nof chariots of the Devas and the neighings of their horses and the sounds of\ntheir hoofs. The Devas walk here and there with canes in their hands and they\nare chiding at intervals the attendants of the Devas. This place is so noisy\nthat no one can hear clearly another\xc2\x92s word. Here are seen thousands of houses\nadorned with trees of gems and jewels and tanks filled with plenty of tasteful\ngood sweet waters. O King! After this there is a second enclosure wall, very\nbig and built of white copper metal (an amalgam of zinc or tin and copper); it\nis so very high that it almost touches the Heavens. It is hundred times more\nbrilliant than the preceding enclosure wall; there are many principal entrance\ngates and various trees here. What to speak of the trees there more than this\nthat all the trees that are found in this universe are found there and they\nbear always flowers, fruits and new leaves! All the quarters are scented with\ntheir sweet fragrance!\n\n\n\n21-40. O King! Now hear, in brief, the names of some of the trees that are\nfound in abundance there :-- Panasa, Vakula, Lodhra, Kar _n_ ikara, S\xc2\x92ins\xc2\x92apa,\nDeodara, Kanchanara, mango, Sumeru, Likucha, Hingula, Ela, Labanga, Ka _t_\nfruit tree, Pa _t_ ala, Muchukunda, Tala, Tamala, Sala, Kankola, Nagabhdra,\nPunnaga, Pilu, Salvaka, Karpura, As\xc2\x92vakar _n_ a, Hastikar _n_ a, Talapar _n_\na, Pomegranate, Ga _n_ ika, Bandhujiva, Jamvira, Kura _nd_ aka, Champeya,\nBandhujiva, Kanakavrik _s_ a, Kalaguru (usually coiled all over with cobras,\nvery black poisonous snakes), Sandaltree, Datetree,Yuthika, Talapar _n_ i,\nSugarcane, K _s_ ira-tree,\n\n\n\np. 1176\n\n\n\nKhadira, Bhallataka, Ruchaka, Ku _t_ aja, Bel tree and others, the Talasi and\nMallika and other forest plants. The place is interspersed with various\nforests and gardens. At intervals there are wells, tanks, etc., adding very\nmuch to the beauty of the place. The cuckoos are perching on every tree and\nthey are cooing sweetly, the bees are drinking the honey and humming all\naround, the trees are emitting juices and sweet fragrance all around. The\ntrees are casting cool nice shadows. The trees of all seasons are seen here;\non the tops of these are sitting pigeons, parrots, female birds of the Mayana\nspecies and other birds of various other species. There are seen rivers\nflowing at intervals carrying many juicy liquids. The Flamingoes, swans, and\nother aquatic animals are playing in them. The breeze is stealing away the\nperfumes of flowers and carrying it all around. The deer are following this\nbreeze. The wild mad peacocks are dancing with madness and the whole place\nlooks very nice, lovely and charming. Next this Ka _m_ sya enclosure comes the\nthird enclosure wall of copper. It is square shaped and seven yojanas high.\nWithin this are forests of Kalpavrik _s_ as, bearing golden leaves and flowers\nand fruits like gems. Their perfumes spread ten yojanas and gladden things all\naround. The king of the seasons preserves always this place. The king\xc2\x92s seat\nis made of flowers; his umbrella is of flowers; ornaments made of flowers; he\ndrinks the honey of the flowers; and, with rolling eyes, he lives here always\nwith his two wives named Madhu S\xc2\x92ri and Madhava S\xc2\x92ri. The two wives of Spring\nhave their faces always smiling. They play with bunches of flowers. This\nforest is very pleasant. Oh! The honey of the flowers is seen here in\nabundance. The perfumes of the full blown flowers spread to a distance of ten\nyojanas. The Gandharbhas, the musicians, live here with their wives.\n\n\n\n41-60. The places round this are filled with the beauties of the spring and\nwith the cooing of cuckoos. No doubt this place intensifies the desires of the\namorous persons! O King! Next comes the enclosure wall, made of lead. Its\nheight is seven yojanas. Within this enclosure there is the garden of the\nSantanaka tree. The fragrance of its flowers extends to ten yojanas. The\nflowers look like gold and are always in full bloom. Its fruits are very\nsweet. They seem to be imbued with nectar drops. In this garden resides always\nthe Summer Season with his two wives S\xc2\x92ukra S\xc2\x92ri and S\xc2\x92uchi S\xc2\x92ri. The\ninhabitants of this place always remain under trees; otherwise they will be\nscorched by summer rays. Various Siddhas and Devas inhabit this place. The\nfemale sensualists here get their bodies all anointed with sandal paste and\nall decked with flower\n\n\n\np. 1177\n\n\n\ngarlands and they stalk to and fro with fans in their hands. There is water to\nbe found here very cool and refreshing. And owing to heat all the people here\nuse this water. Next to this lead enclosure comes the wall made of brass, the\nfifth enclosure wall. It is seven yojanas long. In the centre is situated the\ngarden of Hari Chandana trees. Its ruler is the Rainy Season.\n\n\n\nThe lightnings are his auburn eyes; the clouds are his armour, the thunder is\nhis voice and the rainbow is his arrow. Surrounded by his hosts he rains\nincessantly. He has twelve wives :-- (1) Nabhah S\xc2\x92ri, (2) Nabhahsya S\xc2\x92ri, (3)\nSvarasya, (4) Rasyasalini, (5) Amba, (6) Dula, (7) Niratni, (8) Abhramanti,\n(9) Megha Yantika, (10) Var _s_ ayanti, (11) Chivu _n_ ika, and (12) Varidhara\n(some say Madamatta). All the trees here are always seen with new leaves and\nentwined with new creepers. The whole site is covered all over with fresh\ngreen leaves and twigs. The rivers here always flow full and the current is\nstrong, indeed! The tanks here are very dirty like the minds of worldly\npersons attached to worldly things. The devotees of the Devi, the Siddhas and\nthe Devas and those that consecrated in their life times tanks, wells, and\nreservoirs for the satisfaction of the Devas dwell here with their wives. O\nKing! Next to this brass enclosure comes, the sixth enclosure wall made of\nfive fold irons. It is seven yojanas long. In the centre is situated the\nGarden of Mandara trees. This garden is beautified by various creepers,\nflowers and leaves. The Autumn season lives here with his two wives I _s_ alak\n_s_ mi and \xc3\x9brjalak _s_ mi and he is the ruler. Various Siddha persons dwell\nhere with their wives, well clothed. O King! Next to this comes the seventh\nenclosure wall, seven yojanas long and built of silver.\n\n\n\n61-80. In the centre is situated the garden of Parijata trees. They are filled\nwith bunches of flowers. The fragrance of these Parijatas extend upto the ten\nYojanas and gladden all the things all around. Those who are the Devi Bhaktas\nand who do the works of the Devi are delighted with this fragrance. The\nHemanta (Dewy) season is the Regent of this place. He lives here with his two\nwives Saha S\xc2\x92ri and Sahasya S\xc2\x92ri and with his hosts. Those who are of a loving\nnature are pleased hereby. Those who have become perfect by performing the\nVratas of the Devi live here also. O King! Next to this silver, there comes\nthe eighth enclosure wall built of molten gold. It is seven Yojanas long. In\nthe centre there is the garden of the Kadamba tree. The trees are always\ncovered with fruits and flowers and the honey is coming out always from the\ntrees from all the sides. The devotees of the Devi drink this honey always and\nfeel intense delight; the Dewy Season is the Regent of this\n\n\n\np. 1178\n\n\n\nplace. He resides here with his two wives Tapah S\xc2\x92ri and Tapasya S\xc2\x92ri and his\nvarious hosts, and enjoys gladly various objects of enjoyments. Those who had\nmade various gifts for the Devi\xc2\x92s satisfaction, those great Siddha Puru _s_ as\nlive here with their wives and relatives very gladly in various enjoyments. O\nKing! Next to this golden enclosure well comes the ninth enclosure made of red\nKum Kum like (saffron) Pu _s_ paraga gems. The ground inside this enclosure,\nthe ditches or the basins for water dug round their roots are all built of Pu\n_s_ paraga gems. Next to this wall there are other enclosure walls built of\nvarious other gems and jewels; the sites, forests, trees, flowers birds,\nrivers, tanks, lotuses, ma _nd_ apas (halls) and their pillars are all built\nrespectively of those gems. Only this is to be remembered that those coming\nnearer and nearer to the centre are one lakh times more brilliant than the\nones receding from them. This is the general rule observed in the construction\nof these enclosures and the articles contained therein. Here the Regents of\nthe several quarters, the Dikpalas, representing the sum total of the several\nDikpalas of every Brahma _nd_ a and their guardians reside. On the eastern\nquarter is situated the Amaravati city. Here the high-peaked mountains exist\nand various trees are seen. Indra, the Lord of the Devas, dwells here.\nWhatever beauty exists in the separate Heavens in the several places, one\nthousand times, rather more than that, exists in the Heaven of this cosmic\nIndra, the thousand-eyed, here. Here Indra mounting on the elephant Airavata,\nwith thunderbolt in his hand, lives with S\xc2\x92achi Devi and other immortal ladies\nand with the hosts of the Deva forces. On the Ag _n_ i (south-eastern) corner\nis the city of Ag _n_ i. This represents the sum total of the several cities\nof Ag _n_ i in different Brahma _nd_ as.\n\n\n\n81-100. Here resides the Ag _n_ i Deva very gladly with his two wives Svaha\nand Svadha and with his Vahana and the other Devas. On the south is situated\nthe city of Yama, the God of Death.

Here Varu _n_ a raja resides with his wife Varuni and intoxicated with\nthe drink of Varuni honey; his weapon is the noose, his Vahana is the King of\nfishes and his subjects are the aquatic animals. On the north-western corner\ndwells Vayudeva. Here Pavana Deva lives with his wife and with the Yogis\nperfect in the practice of Pranayama. He holds a flag in his hand.\n\n\n\np. 1179\n\n\n\nHis Vahana, is deer and his family consists of the forty nine Vayus. On the\nnorth resides the Yak _s_ as. The corpulent King of the Yak _s_ as, Kuvera,\nlives here with his S\xc2\x92aktis Vriddhi and Riddhi, and in possession of various\ngems and jewels. His generals Ma _n_ ibhadra, Pur _n_ a bhadra, Ma _n_ iman,\nMa _n_ ikandhara, Ma _n_ ibhusa, Manisragvi, Ma _n_ ikar-mukadhari, etc., live\nhere. On the north eastern corner is situated the Rudra loka, decked with\ninvaluable gems. Here dwells the Rudra Deva. On His back is kept the arrow-\ncase and he holds a bow in his left hand. He looks very angry and his eyes are\nred with anger. There are other Rudras like him with bows and spears and other\nweapons, surrounding him. The faces of some of them are distorted; some are\nvery horrible indeed! Fire is coming out from the mouths of some others. Some\nhave ten hands; some have hundred hands and some have thousand hands; some\nhave ten feet; some have ten heads whereas some others have three eyes. Those\nwho roam in the intermediate spaces between the heaven and earth, those who\nmove on the earth, or the Rudras mentioned in the Rudradhyaya all live here. O\nKing! \xc3\x8esana, the Regent of the north eastern quarter lives here with\nBhadrakali and other Matriga _n_ as, with Ko _t_ is and Ko _t_ is of Rudra _n_\nis and with _D_ amaris and Vira Bhadras and various other S\xc2\x92aktis. On his neck\nthere is a garland of skulls, on his hand there is a ring of snakes; he wears\na tiger skin; his upper clothing is a tiger skin and his body is smeared with\nthe ashes of the dead. He sounds frequently his _D_ amaru; this sound\nreverberates on all sides, he makes big laughs called A _tt_ ahasya,\nreverberating through the heavens. He remains always surrounded with Pramathas\nand Bhutas; they live here.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Tenth Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the description of Ma _n_ i\nDvipa in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk12ch11.htm)\n\n'
