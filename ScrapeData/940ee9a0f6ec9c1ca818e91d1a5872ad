 \nThe glory of the Warrior race  \nWith craven speech his lips debase?  \nCan one like thee so falsely speak,  \nExalling Fate, confessed so weak?  \nCanst thou, undoubting still restrain?  \nSuspicions of those sinful twain?  \n\nCanst thou, most duteous, fail to know  \nTheir hearts are set on duty's show?  \nThey with deceit have set their trains,  \nAnd now the fruit rewards their pains,  \nHad they not long ago agreed,  \nO Rama, on this treacherous deed,  \nThat promised boon, so long retained,  \nHe erst had given and she had gained.  \nI cannot, O my brother, bear  \nTo see another throned as heir  \nWith rites which all our people hate:  \nThen, O, this passion tolerate.  \nThis vaunted duty which can guide  \nThy steps from wisdom's path aside,  \nAnd change the counsel of thy breast,  \nO lofty-hearted, I detest.  \nWilt thou, when power and might are thine,  \nSubmit to this abhorred design?  \nThy father's impious hest fulfil,  \nThat vassal of Kaikeyi's will?  \nBut if thou still wilt shut thine eyes,  \nNor see the guile herein that lies.  \nMy soul is sad, I deeply mourn.  \nAnd duty seems a thing to scorn.  \nCanst thou one moment think to please  \nThis pair who live for love and ease,  \nAnd 'gainst thy peace, as foes, allied,  \nWith tenderest names their hatred hide  \nNow if thy judgment still refers  \nTo Fate this plot of his and hers,  \nMy mind herein can ne'er agree:  \nAnd O, in this be ruled by me.  \nWeak, void of manly pride are they  \nWho bend to Fate's imputed sway:  \nThe choicest souls, the nobly great  \nDisdain to bow their heads to Fate.  \nAnd he who dares his Fate control  \nWith vigorous act and manly soul,  \nThough threatening Fate his hopes assail.  \nUnmoved through all need never quail.  \nThis day mankind shall learn aright  \nThe power of Fate and human might,  \nSo shall the gulf that lies between  \nA man and Fate be clearly seen.  \nThe might of Fate subdued by me  \nThis hour the citizens shall see,  \nWho saw its intervention stay  \nThy consecrating rites to-day  \nMy power shall turn this Fate aside,  \nThat threatens, as, with furious stride,  \nAn elephant who scorns to feel,  \nIn rage unchecked, tne driver's steel.  \nNot the great Lords whose sleepless might  \nProtects the worlds, shall stay the rite  \nThough earth, hell, heaven combine their powers:  \nAnd shall we fear this sire of ours?  \nThen if their minds are idly bent  \nTo doom thee, King, to banishment,  \nThrough twice seven years of exile they  \n\np. 122  \n\nShall In the lonely forest stay.  \nI will consume the hopes that fire  \nThe queen Kaikeyi and our sire,  \nThat to her son this check will bring  \nAdvantage, making Bharat king.  \nThe power of Fate will ne'er withstand  \nThe might that arms my vigorous hand;  \nIf danger and distress assail,  \nMy fearless strength will still prevail.  \nA thousand circling years shall flee:  \nThe forest then thy home shall be,  \nAnd thy good sons, succeeding, hold  \nThe empire which their sire controlled.  \nThe royal saints, of old who reigned,  \nFor aged kings this rest ordained:  \nThese to their sons their realm commit  \nThat they, like sires, may cherish it.  \nO pious soul, if thou decline  \nThe empire which is justly thine,  \nLest, while the king distracted lies,  \nDisorder in the state should rise,  \nI,--or no mansion may I find  \nIn worlds to hero souls assigned,--  \nThe guardian of thy realm will be,  \nAs the sea-bank protects the sea.  \nThen cast thine idle fears aside:  \nWith prosperous rites be sanctified.  \nThe lords of earth may strive in vain:  \nMy power shall all their force restrain.  \nMy pair of arms, my warrior's bow  \nAre not for pride of empty show:  \nFor no support these shafts were made;  \nAnd binding up ill suits my blade:  \nTo pierce the foe with deadly breach--  \nThis is the work of all and each.  \nBut small, methinks the love I show  \nFor him I count my mortal foe.  \nSoon as my trenchant steel is bare,  \nFlashing its lightning through the air,  \nI heed no foe, nor stand aghast  \nThough Indra's self the levin cast.  \nThen shall the ways be hard to pass,  \nWhere chariots lie in ruinous mass;  \nWhen elephant and man and steed  \nCrushed in the murderous onslaught bleed,  \nAnd legs and heads tall, heap on heap,  \nBeneath my sword's tremendous sweep.  \nStruck by my keen brand's trenchant blade,  \nThine enemies shall fall dismayed,  \nLike towering mountains rent in twain,  \nOr lightning clouds that burst in rain.  \nWhen armed with brace and glove I stand,  \nAnd take my trusty bow in hand,  \nWho then shall vaunt his might? who dare  \nCount him a man to meet me there?  \nThen will I loose my shafts, and strike  \nMan, elephant, and steed alike:  \nAt one shall many an arrow fly,  \nAnd many a foe with one shall die.  \nThis day the world my power shall see,  \nThat none in arms can rival me:  \nMy strength the monarch shall abase,  \nAnd set thee, lord, in lordliest place.  \nThese arms which breathe the sandal's  \n   scent,  \nWhich golden bracelets ornament,  \nThese hands which precious gifts bestow,  \nWhich guard the friend and smite the foe,  \nA nobler service shall assay,  \nAnd fight in Rama's cause to-day,  \nThe robbers of thy rights to stay.  \n   Speak, brother, tell thy foeman's name  \n     Whom I, in conquering strife,  \n   May strip of followers and fame,  \n     Of fortune, or of life.  \n   Say, how may all this sea-girt land  \n     Be brought to own thy sway:  \n   Thy faithful servant here I stand  \n     To listen and obey.'  \n   Then strove the bride of Raghu's race  \n     Sad Lakshman's heart to cheer,  \n   While slowly down the hero's face,  \n     Unchecked, there rolled a tear.  \n   'The orders of my sire,' he cried,  \n     'My will shall ne'er oppose:  \n   I follow still, whate'er betide,  \n     The path which duty shows.'  \n\n        * * * * *  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[121:1](ry101.htm#fr_291) The Sanskrit word _hasta_ signifies both _hand_ ,\nand the trunk of the beast that bears between his eyes a serpent for a hand.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXIV.: Kaus'alya Calmed.](ry102.htm)\n\n"
