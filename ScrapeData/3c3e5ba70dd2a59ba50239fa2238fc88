Then Kausalya \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana asked: 'Sir, whence is that Pra _n_ a\n(spirit) born? How does it come into this body? And how does it abide, after\nit has divided itself? How does it go out? How does it support what is without\n4, and how what is within?'\n\n2\\. He replied: 'You ask questions more difficult, but you are very fond of\nBrahman, therefore I shall tell it you.\n\n3\\. This Pra _n_ a (spirit) is born of the Self. Like the shadow thrown on a\nman, this (the pra _n_ a) is\n\np. 277\n\nspread out over it (the Brahman) 1. By the work of the mind 2 does it come\ninto this body.\n\n4\\. As a king commands officials, saying to them: Rule these villages or\nthose, so does that Pra _n_ a (spirit) dispose the other pra _n_ as, each for\ntheir separate work.\n\n5\\. The Apana (the down-breathing) in the organs of excretion and generation;\nthe Pra _n_ a himself dwells in eye and ear, passing through mouth and nose.\nIn the middle is the Samana 3 (the on-breathing); it carries what has been\nsacrificed as food equally (over the body), and the seven lights proceed from\nit.\n\n6\\. The Self 4 is in the heart. There are the 101 arteries, and in each of\nthem there are a hundred (smaller veins), and for each of these branches there\nare 72,000 5. In these the Vyana (the back-breathing) moves.\n\np. 278\n\n7\\. Through one of them, the Udana (the out-breathing) leads (us) upwards to\nthe good world by good work, to the bad world by bad work, to the world of men\nby both.\n\n8\\. The sun rises as the external Pra _n_ a, for it assists the Pra _n_ a in\nthe eye 1. The deity that exists in the earth, is there in support of man's\nApana (down-breathing). The ether between (sun and earth) is the Samana (on-\nbreathing), the air is Vyana (back-breathing).\n\n9\\. Light is the Udana (out-breathing), and therefore he whose light has gone\nout comes to a new birth with his senses absorbed in the mind.\n\n10\\. Whatever his thought (at the time of death) with that he goes back to Pra\n_n_ a, and the Pra _n_ a, united with light 2, together with the self (the _g_\nivatma) leads on to the world, as deserved.\n\n11\\. He who, thus knowing, knows Pra _n_ a, his offspring does not perish, and\nhe becomes immortal. Thus says the _S_ loka:\n\n12\\. He who has known the origin 3, the entry, the place, the fivefold\ndistribution, and the internal state 4 of the Pra _n_ a, obtains immortality,\nyes, obtains immortality.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[276:4](sbe15108.htm#fr_892) All creatures and the gods.\n\n[277:1](sbe15108.htm#fr_893) Over Brahman, i.e. the Self, the parama purusha,\nthe akshara, the satya. The pra _n_ a being called a shadow, is thereby\nimplied to be unreal (an _ri_ ta). _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara.\n\n[277:2](sbe15108.htm#fr_894) Manok _ri_ ta is explained as an arsha sandhi. It\nmeans the good or evil deeds, which are the work of the mind.\n\n[277:3](sbe15108.htm#fr_895) I keep to the usual translation of Samana by on-\nbreathing, though it is here explained in a different sense. Samana is here\nsupposed to be between pra _n_ a and apana, and to distribute the food\nequally, samam, over the body. The seven lights are explained as the two eyes,\nthe two ears, the two nostrils, and the mouth.\n\n[277:4](sbe15108.htm#fr_896) Here the Li\xe1\xb9\x85gatma or _G_ ivatma.\n\n[277:5](sbe15108.htm#fr_897) A hundred times 101 would give us 10,100, and\neach multiplied by 72,000 would give us a sum total of 727,200,000 veins, or,\nif we add the principal veins, 727,210,201. \xc3\x82nandagiri makes the sum total, 72\nko _t_ is, 72 lakshas, six thousands, two hundred and one, where the six of\nthe thousands seems to be a mistake for da _s_ asahasram. In the B _ri_ hadar.\nUpanishad II, 1, 19, we read of 72,000 arteries, likewise in Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya III, 108. See also B _ri_ h. Up. IV, p. 2783, 20; _Kh_ and. Up. VI, 5,\n3, comm.; Kaush. Up. IV, 20; Ka _th_ a Up. VI, 16.\n\n[278:1](sbe15108.htm#fr_898) Without the sun the eye could not see.\n\n[278:2](sbe15108.htm#fr_899) With Udana, the out-breathing\n\n[278:3](sbe15108.htm#fr_900) This refers to the questions asked in verse 1,\nand answered in the verses which follow.\n\n[278:4](sbe15108.htm#fr_901) The adhyatma, as opposed to the vahya, mentioned\nin verse 1. Ayati instead of ayati is explained by _kh_ andasa _m_ hrasvatvam.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fourth Question](sbe15109.htm)\n\n"
