The writer has been brought up in\na family where texts of the Upanishads are used in daily worship; and he has\nhad before him the example of his father, who lived his long life in the\nclosest communion with God, while not neglecting his duties to the world, or\nallowing his keen interest in all human affairs to suffer any abatement. So in\nthese papers, it may be hoped, western readers will have an opportunity of\ncoming into touch with the ancient spirit of India as revealed in our sacred\ntexts and manifested in the life of to-day.\n\nAll the great utterances of man have to be judged not by the letter but by the\nspirit--the spirit which unfolds itself with the growth of life in history. We\nget to know the real meaning of Christianity by observing its living aspect at\nthe present moment--however different that may be, even in important respects,\nfrom the Christianity of earlier periods.\n\nFor western scholars the great religious scriptures of India seem to possess\nmerely a retrospective and archaelogical interest; but to us they are of\nliving importance, and we cannot help thinking that they lose their\nsignificance when exhibited in labelled cases--mummied specimens of human\nthought and aspiration, preserved for all time in the wrappings of erudition.\n\nThe meaning of the living words that come out of the experiences of great\nhearts can never be exhausted by any one system of logical interpretation.\nThey have to be endlessly explained by the commentaries of individual lives,\nand they gain an added mystery in each new revelation. To me the verses of the\nUpanishads and the teachings of Buddha have ever been things of the spirit,\nand therefore endowed with boundless vital growth; and I have used them, both\nin my own life and in my preaching, as being instinct with individual meaning\nfor me, as for others, and awaiting for their confirmation, my own special\ntestimony, which must have its value because of its individuality.\n\nI should add perhaps that these papers embody in a connected form, suited to\nthis publication, ideas which have been culled from several of the Bengali\ndiscourses which I am in the habit of giving to my students in my school at\nBolpur in Bengal; and I have used here and there translations of passages from\nthese done by my friends, Babu Satish Chandra Roy and Babu Ajit Kumar\nChakravarti. The last paper of this series, "Realisation in Action," has been\ntranslated from my Bengali discourse on "Karma- yoga" by my nephew, Babu\nSurendra Nath Tagore.\n\nI take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to Professor James H.\nWoods, of Harvard University, for his generous appreciation which encouraged\nme to complete this series of papers and read most of them before the Harvard\nUniversity. And I offer my thanks to Mr. Ernest Rhys for his kindness in\nhelping me with suggestions and revisions, and in going through the proofs.\n\nA word may be added about the pronouncing of S\xc4\x81dhan\xc4\x81: the accent falls\ndecisively on the first \xc4\x81, which has the broad sound of the letter.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Contents](sadh02.htm)\n\n'
