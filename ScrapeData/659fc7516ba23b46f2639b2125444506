On account of that (word which indicates origin) being enunciated at first\n(in connexion with the pra _n_ as).\n\nThat the scriptural statement about the origin of the\n\np. 78\n\npra _n_ as is to be taken in its literal sense just as the statements about\nthe ether, &c., appears from that circumstance also that the one word which\n(in the passage from the Mu. Up.) indicates origination, viz. 'is born' ( _g_\nayate in the first place connected with the pra _n_ as and has afterwards to\nbe joined with ether, &c., also ('from him is born breath, mind, and all\norgans of sense, ether, air,' &c.). Now as it is a settled matter that the\nphrase 'is born' must be taken in its primary sense with reference to ether\nand so on, it follows that the origin of the pra _n_ as also to which the same\nword is applied must be understood as a real origin. For it would be\nimpossible to decide that a word enunciated once only in one chapter and one\nsentence, and connected with many other words, has in some cases to be taken\nin its primary sense, and in others in a secondary sense; for such a decision\nwould imply want of uniformity.--So likewise in the passage, 'He sent forth\npra _n_ a, from pra _n_ a _s_ raddha (Pr. Up. VI, 4), the phrase 'he sent\nforth' which the text exhibits in conjunction with the pra _n_ as has to be\ncarried on to _s_ raddha the other things which have an origin.--The same\nreasoning holds good in those cases where the word expressing origination\noccurs at the end and has to be connected with the preceding words; as e.g. in\nthe passage ending 'all beings come forth from the Self,' where the word 'come\nforth' must be connected with the pra _n_ as, &c., mentioned in the earlier\npart of the sentence.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 4](sbe38058.htm)\n\n"
