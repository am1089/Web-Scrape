After marriage the rites prescribed for a householder and his wife (must\nbe performed). 1\n\n2\\. He shall eat at the two (appointed) times, (morning and evening) 2\n\np. 100\n\n3\\. And he shall not eat to repletion.\n\n4\\. And both (the householder and his wife) shall fast on (the days of) the\nnew, and full moon,\n\n5\\. To eat once (on those days in the morning) that also is called fasting. 5\n\n6\\. And they may eat (at that meal) until they are quite satisfied.\n\n7\\. And on (the anniversary of) that (wedding)-day they may eat that food of\nwhich they are fond. 7\n\n8\\. And (on the night of that day) they shall sleep on the ground (on a raised\nheap of earth). 8\n\n9\\. And they shall avoid connubial intercourse.\n\n10\\. And on the day after (that day) a Sthalipaka must be offered. 10\n\n11\\. The manner in which that offering must be 11\n\np. 101\n\nperformed has been declared by (the description of the Sthalipaka) to be\nperformed on the days of the new and full moon (the Parva _n_ a).\n\n12\\. And they declare (that this rite which is known) amongst the people (must\nbe performed) every (year). 12\n\n13\\. At every (burnt-offering), when he wishes to place the fire on the altar\n(called Stha _n_ _d_ ila), let him draw on that (altar) three lines from west\nto east and three lines from south to north, and sprinkle (the altar) with\nwater, turning the palm of the hand downwards, and let him then make the fire\nburn brightly by adding (fuel). 13\n\n14\\. He shall pour out (the remainder of) this water used for sprinkling, to\nthe north or to the east (of the altar), and take other (water into the\nvessel).\n\n15\\. The water-vessels in the house shall never be empty; that is the duty to\nbe observed by the householder and his wife. 15\n\np. 102\n\n16\\. Let him not have connubial intercourse (with his wife) in the day-time.\n\n17\\. But let him have connection with his wife at the proper time, according\nto the rules (of the law). 17\n\n18\\. Let him have connubial intercourse in the interval also, if his wife\n(desires it, observing the restrictions imposed by the law). 18\n\n19\\. (The duty of) connubial intercourse (follows from) the passage of a\nBrahma _n_ a, (\'Let us dwell together until a son be born.\') 19\n\n20\\. But during intercourse he shall be dressed in a particular dress kept for\nthis purpose.\n\n21\\. And during intercourse only they shall lie together,\n\n22\\. Afterwards separate.\n\n23\\. Then they both shall bathe;\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[99:1](sbe0236.htm#fr_527) **1**. According to Haradatta, this rule is\nintended to refute the opinion of those who hold that the sacred household-\nfire may be kept, and the prescribed offerings therein may be performed,\neither from the time of the marriage, or after the division of the family\nestate. He also states that the use of the dual g _ri_ hamedhino _h_ indicates\nthat husband and wife must perform the rites conjointly. Manu III, 67.\n\n[99:2](sbe0236.htm#fr_528) Haradatta thinks that this Sutra is intended to\nprevent householders from having more than two meals a day, and to keep them\nfrom gluttony. Others are of opinion that its object is to keep householders\nfrom excessive fasting, and to make them perform the Pra _n_ agnihotra at\neither meal. At the Pra _n_ agnihotra the sacrificer eats five mouthfuls\ninvoking successively, whilst he p. 100 eats, the five vital airs. At the\nfirst mouthful he says, \'To Pra _n_ a svaha;\' at the second, \'To Apana svaha,\'\n&c.\n\n[100:5](sbe0236.htm#fr_529) \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 10, 2.\n\n[100:7](sbe0236.htm#fr_530) Haradatta holds that the words \'on that day\' do\nnot refer to the days of the new and full moon, the Parvan-days, mentioned in\nSutra 4. His reasons are, first, that the permission to eat food, of which the\nhouseholder may be particularly fond, has already been given in Sutra 6, by\nthe term t _ri_ pi _h_ , \'satisfaction\'; and, secondly, that the singular \'on\nthis day\' does not agree with the plural \'on the Parvan-days.\' Hence he comes\nto the conclusion that the words \'on that day\' must refer to the wedding-day,\nmentioned in Sutra 1, as well as to its anniversary. Haradatta is, probably,\nright in his explanation, though the reasons adduced here are very weak. A\nstronger reason for detaching this Sutra from Sutra 4 will be brought forward\nbelow, under Sutra 11. Mahadeva, the commentator of the Hira _n_ yake _s_\nidharma, adopts the view rejected by Haradatta.\n\n[100:8](sbe0236.htm#fr_531) \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 3, 10.\n\n[100:10](sbe0236.htm#fr_532) A Sthalipaka is an offering at which rice cooked\nin a pot, sthali, is offered in the fire. A full description of this kind of\nsacrifice occurs, \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 10, 1 seq.\n\n[100:11](sbe0236.htm#fr_533) The Parva _n_ a Sthalipaka has been described by\n\xc3\x82pastamba p. 101 in the G _ri_ hya-sutra, III, 7. Again, Haradatta returns to\nthe question whether the words on that day (Sutra 7) refer to the Parvan-days,\nor the marriage-day and its anniversaries. He now adds, in favour of the\nlatter view, that the word Parva _n_ ena, \'by the rite to be performed on\nParvan-days,\' by which the Sthalipaka on Parvan-days is intended, clearly\nproves the impossibility to refer he preceding rules to the Parvan-days. He\nadds that some, nevertheless, adopt the explanation rejected by himself.\n\n[101:12](sbe0236.htm#fr_534) They, i.e. the _S_ ish _t_ as, those learned in\nthe law. \'Another commentator says, the rite which will be taught (in the\nfollowing Sutra), and which is known from the usage of the learned, is\nconstant, i.e. must be performed in every case. That it is what the "learned"\ndeclare.\'--Haradatta. The latter explanation of the Sutra is adopted by\nMahadeva.\n\n[101:13](sbe0236.htm#fr_535) \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 3, 1-3.\n\n[101:15](sbe0236.htm#fr_536) Haradatta states that the object of the\nrepetition of the words \'the householder and his wife\' is to show that they\nthemselves must fill the water-vessels, and not employ others for this\npurpose. He adds that, according to another commentator, the object of the\nrepetition is to show that Sutras 13 and 14 apply not only to householders,\nbut also to students, and that hence students, when they offer the daily\noblations of sacred fuel (above, I, 1, 4, 14 seq.), should also perform the\nrites taught in the preceding Sutras.\n\n[102:17](sbe0236.htm#fr_537) See Manu III, 46-48; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 79, 80.\n\n[102:18](sbe0236.htm#fr_538) Manu III, 45; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 81.\n\n[102:19](sbe0236.htm#fr_539) See Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita II, 5, 1, 5.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 1, Kha _n_ _d_ a 2](sbe0237.htm)\n\n'
