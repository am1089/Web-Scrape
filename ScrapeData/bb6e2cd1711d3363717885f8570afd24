Vyasa said :-- O King! When Varu _n_ a went away, the King was very much\nlaid down with that dropsy and daily his pains began to increase and he began\nto suffer extreme pains. O King! The prince, on the other hand, heard, in the\nforest, of the illness of his father and filled with affection, wanted to go\nto his father. A year had passed away and the prince desired very gladly to go\nto his father and see him. Knowing this, Indra came there. He came instantly\nin the form of a Brahmi _n_ and with favourable arguments desisted the prince,\nwho was about to go to his father.\n\n\n\n5-31. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O Prince! It seems you are silly; you know nothing of\nthe difficult state policies. Therefore it is that you are ready to go, out of\nsheer ignorance, to your father. O Fortunate One! If you go there, your father\nwill get his sacrifice, where a human victim is to be offered, performed by\nthe Vedic Brahma _n_ as and your flesh will be offered are oblations to the\nblazing Fire. O Child! The souls of all the beings are very dear; it is for\nthat reason, for the sake of soul, that sons, wife, wealth and jewels are all\ndear. Therefore, though you are his dear son, like his son, yet he will\ncertainly have you killed and get Homas offered, to free himself from the\ndisease. O Prince! You ought not to go home now; rather when your father dies,\nyou would certainly go there and inherit your Kingdom.\xc2\x94 O King! Thus hindered\nby Vasava, the prince remained in that forest for one year more. But when the\nprince again heard of the severe illness of his father, he wanted again to go\nto his father, resolved to court the death of his ownself. Indra also came\nthere in the form of a Brahma _n_ and, with reasonable words, repeatedly\nadvised him not to go there. Here, on the other hand, the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra\nbecame very much distressed and troubled by the disease and asked his family\npriest Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha Deva :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ a! What is the sure remedy for the\ncure of the disease?\xc2\x94 Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, the Brahma\xc2\x92s son, said :-- \xc2\x93O King!\nPurchase one son by giving his value; then perform the sacrifice with that\npurchased son and you will be free from the curse. O King! The Brahmi _n_ s,\nversed in the Vedas, say that sons are of ten kinds, of whom the son,\npurchased by paying its proper value, is one of them. So buy one son. There\nwill very probably be within your kingdom a Brahmi _n_ who might sell out of\navarice, his son. In that case Varu _n_ a Deva will certainly be\n\n\n\np. 648\n\n\n\npleased and grant your happiness.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of the high-souled\nVas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, the King became glad and ordered his minister to look after\nsuch a son. There lived in that King\xc2\x92s dominion one Brahmi _n_ , named\nAjigarta, very poor; he had three sons. The minister spoke to him to purchase\nhis son :-- \xc2\x93I will give you one hundred cows; give one son of yours for the\nsacrifice. You have three sons named respectively S\xc2\x92unahpuchcha, S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha\nand S\xc2\x92unolangula. Give me out of them one son and I will give you one hundred\ncows as his value.\xc2\x94 Ajigarta was very much distressed for want of food; so\nwhen he heard the proposal, he expressed his desire to sell his son. He\nthought that his eldest son was the rightful person to perform funeral\nobsequies and offer Pi _nd_ a and he therefore did not spare him. The youngest\nson, too, he did not spare also, as he considered that his own. At last, he\nsold his second son for the price of one hundred cows. The King then bought\nhim and made him the victim for the sacrifice. When that boy was fastened to\nthe sacrificial post, he began to tremble and very much distressed with sorrow\nbegan to cry. Seeing this, the Munis cried out in a very pitiful tone. When\nthe King gave permission for the immolation of that boy, the slaughterer did\nnot take weapons to slaughter him. He told that he would never be able to kill\nthe boy, since he is crying in a very pitiful tone. When he thus withdrew\nhimself from his work, the King then asked his councillors :-- O Devas! What\nought to be done now? S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha then began to cry in a very pitiful voice;\nthe people present there began to discuss and there arose a great noise on the\naffair. Then Ajigarta stood up in the midst of the assembly and spoke :-- \xc2\x93O\nKing! Be patient; I will fulfil your desire. I am desirous of wealth and if\nyou give me double the amount, I will slay immediately the victim; and you can\ncomplete early your sacrifice.\xc2\x94 O King! He who is hankering after money, can\nalways entertain\n\nfeelings of enmity even towards his own son. There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n32-35. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing those words of Ajigarta, Haris\xc2\x92chandra\ngladly spoke to him :-- \xc2\x93I will immediately give you another hundred excellent\ncows.\xc2\x94 Hearing thus, the son\xc2\x92s father, avaricious of wealth, immediately\nresolved and became ready to slay his son. All the councillors seeing the\nfather ready to slay his son, were struck with sorrow and began to lament\nexclaiming \xc2\x93Alas! This wretch, a disgrace to his family, is now ready to kill\nhis own son. Oh! We never saw before such a cruel vicious person. This Brahmi\n_n_ must be a Demon in a Brahmi _n_ body!\n\n\n\np. 649\n\n\n\n36-38. Fie on you! O Cha _nd_ ala! What a vicious work are you now going to\ndo? What happiness do you derive by slaying the son, the jewel of jewels, only\nto get some wealth? O Sinner! It is stated in the Vedas that the soul takes\nits birth from one\xc2\x92s body; so how are you going to slay your soul!\xc2\x94 When the\nhue and cry arose in the assembly, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, the son of Kaus\xc2\x92ika, went to\nthe King and, out of pity, said :--\n\n\n\n39-56. O King! S\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha is very piteously crying; so let him be free; and\nthen your sacrifice will be complete and you will be free of your disease.\nThere is no virtue like mercy and there is no vice like killing (Himsa). What\nis written about killing animals in the sacrifice, is only meant for the\npersons inclined to sensual objects and to give them a stimulus in that\ndirection. O King! He who wants his own welfare and who wants to preserve his\nown body ought not to cut another\xc2\x92s body. He who pities equally all the\nbeings, gets contended with a trivial gain and subdues all his senses; God is\nsoon pleased with him. O King! You should treat all the Jivas like yourself\nand thus always spend your life, so dear to all. You desire to preserve your\nbody by taking away the life of this boy; similarly why would he not try to\npreserve his own body, the receptacle of happiness and pleasures. O King! You\nhave desired to kill this innocent Brahmi _n_ boy; but he will never overlook\nthis enmity of yours done in previous lives. If anybody kills another\nwillingly, though he has got no enmity with him, then the one that is killed\nwill certainly kill afterwards the slayer. His father, out of greed for money,\nis deprived of intellect and so has sold away his son. The Brahmi _n_ is\ncertainly very cruel and sinful. There is no doubt in this. When one goes to\nGaya or one performs an As\xc2\x92vamedha sacrifice or when one offers a blue bull\n(Nila Vri _s_ abha), one does so on the consideration that one would desire to\nhave many sons. Moreover the King has to suffer for one-sixth of the sins\ncommitted by anyone in his Kingdom. There is no doubt in this. Therefore the\nKing ought certainly to prohibit any man when he wants to do a sinful act. Why\nthen did you not prevent this man when he desired to sell his son? O King! You\nare the son of Tris\xc2\x92anku; especially you are born in the Solar line of Kings.\nSo how have you desired, being born an \xc3\x82rya, to do an act becoming an An-\xc3\x82rya\n(non-aryan). If you take my word and quickly free this Brahmi _n_ boy, you\nwill certainly derive virtue in your body. Your father was converted into a\nCha _nd_ ala by a curse but I sent him in his very body to the Heavens. And\nyou are well acquainted with this fact. Therefore, O King! Keep my word out of\nyour love for that. This boy is very pitifully crying; so free him. I pray\nthis from you in this your Rajasuya sacrifice and if you do not keep my word,\nyou will incur the\n\n\n\np. 650\n\n\n\nsin of not keeping my word. Do you not realise this? O King! You will have to\ngive anything that a man wants from you in this sacrifice; but if you do\notherwise, sin will attack you, no doubt.\n\n\n\n57-59. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing these words of Kaus\xc2\x92ika, the King\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra spoke thus :-- O son of Gadhi! I am suffering very much from the\ndropsy; I will not be able therefore to free him. You can pray for some other\nthing. You ought not to throw obstacles in this my sacrifice. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra\nbecame very angry at this, and seeing the Brahmi _n_ boy very distressed,\nbecame sorrowful and mourned very much.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixteenth Chapter in the Seventh Book on the story of\nS\xc2\x92unahs\xc2\x92epha in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses,\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 17](bk07ch17.htm)\n\n'
