And on account of the indications of equality of enjoyment only.\n\nThe lordly power of those who take their stand on the effected Brahman is not\nabsolute, for that reason also that scripture teaches that their enjoyment\nonly is equal to that of the eternally perfect Lord. For scripture contains\nstatements and indications of the difference (of the Lord and the released\nsoul); compare 'To him he says, Water indeed is enjoyed\n[1](sbe38338.htm#fn_237) (by me); that world (is to be enjoyed by thee also)'\n(Kau. Up. I, 7); 'As all beings honour that deity, so do all beings honour him\nwho knows that' (B _ri_. Up. I, 5, 20); 'He obtains through it equality (in\nbody) and sameness of abode with that deity' (B _ri_. Up. I, 5, 23). But from\nthe circumstance of the lordly power of the released souls not being absolute\nit follows that it comes to an end, and then they will have to return from the\nworld of Brahman!--To this objection the reverend Badaraya _n_ a replies in\nthe following Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 22](sbe38338.htm)\n\n"
