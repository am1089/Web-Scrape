On the day of preparation, early in the morning, when the sun has\nrisen, he releases his speech.\n\np. 182\n\n[paragraph continues] Having released his speech, he takes clarified butter,\nin five ladlings, and throws five chips of gold thereon. Then these three\n(materials), sour curds, honey and ghee, are poured together, either into a\ndish, or a pot with a wide mouth; and he puts a handful of sacrificial grass\nthereon.\n\n9:2:1:22\\. He then mounts the fire-altar, with (Va _g_. S. XVII, II), 'Homage\nbe to thy heat, thy fire 1! homage be to thy flame!'--for that Agni has now\nbeen completely restored, and he now is equal to injuring whomever he might\nwish to injure; and whomever he injures, he injures either by his heat, or by\nhis fire, or by his flame; in this way he does not injure him thereby (etai\n_h_ );--'Let thy darts burn others than us! unto us be thou bright and\npropitious!' as the text, so the sense.\n\n9:2:1:33\\. Having mounted the altar, he makes the libation of fivefold-taken\nghee on the naturally-perforated (brick): the significance of this has been\nexplained 2.\n\n9:2:1:44\\. On the naturally-perforated (brick) he makes the libation--the\nnaturally-perforated one is the breath: into (the channel of) the breath he\nthus puts food.\n\n9:2:1:55\\. And, again, as to why he offers on the naturally-perforated\none;--this (brick) is an uttara-vedi (high-altar) of Agni (the fire-altar);\nand that former libation which he makes 3 belongs to the\n\np. 183\n\n[paragraph continues] Soma-sacrifice, but this one belongs to the fire-altar;\nthis he now offers.\n\n9:2:1:66\\. On that (former) occasion he makes the libation whilst looking at\nthe gold; for distinct is what one sees, and distinct was that high-altar; and\nthrown down 1, indeed, are (the gold chips) on this occasion, and indistinct\nis what is thrown down, and indistinct is this high-altar.\n\n9:2:1:77\\. With the Svaha-call he makes the libation on that (high-altar), for\ndistinct (manifest) is the Svaha, and distinct is that high-altar; but with\nthe Ve _t_ -call (he offers) on this (brick), for indistinct is the Ve _t_\n-call, and indistinct is this high-altar. With ghee (they offer), for with\nghee they offer on the high-altar;--with fivefold-taken (ghee), for with\nfivefold-taken (ghee) they offer on the high-altar:--by turns (he makes the\nlibations), for by turns 2 they make the libations on the high-altar.\n\n9:2:1:88\\. [He offers, with, Va _g_. S. XVII, 12, a-c resp.], 'To the man-\nseated, ve _t_!'--the man-seated one, doubtless, is the breath, and men mean\nhuman beings: he thereby gratifies that fire (or Agni), the breath, which is\nin human beings;--'To the water-seated, ve _t_!--he thereby gratifies the fire\nwhich is in the waters;--'To the barhis-seated, ve _t_!' he\n\np. 184\n\nthereby gratifies the fire which is in plants 1;--'To the wood-seated, ve\n_t_!'--he thereby gratifies the fire which is in trees;--'To the heaven-\nwinning, ve _t_!'--the heaven-winning one is this Agni ( _k_ itya): it is this\nAgni he thereby gratifies.\n\n9:2:1:99\\. And as to why he says, 'To the man-seated, ve _t_! To the water-\nseated, ve _t_!' &c., these are names of this Agni: these names he thereby\npleases. By means of the oblation he makes them a deity: for whatever deity\nthe oblation is prepared, that deity (they are), not that deity for whom it is\nnot prepared. And, in calling them by their names, he also thereby places\nthose fires along with this fire.\n\n9:2:1:1010\\. These are five oblations he offers,--the fire-altar consists of\nfive layers, the year of five seasons, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni\nis, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.\n\n9:2:1:1111\\. He then sprinkles him (Agni, the fire-altar) with the sour curds,\nhoney and ghee; when he is built up, he is born, and he is born for every\n(kind of) food; and these, to wit, sour curds, honey and ghee, are every (kind\nof) food: with every (kind of) food he thus gratifies him. Everywhere (he\nsprinkles the altar): everywhere he thus gratifies him with every (kind of)\nfood.\n\n9:2:1:1212\\. And, again, as to why he sprinkles him;--here that Agni has been\nbuilt up complete: on him the gods now bestowed the highest (or last) form;\nand in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now bestow on him the highest (or\nlast) form; but form means\n\np. 185\n\nfood, and these, to wit, sour curds, honey and ghee, are the most excellent\nkind of food: this, the most excellent form he thus bestows upon him as his\nhighest (property). Everywhere he sprinkles, even outside the enclosing-\nstones; everywhere he thus bestows on him the highest form;--by means of\nsacrificial grass-stalks (he sprinkles), for they are pure and meet for\nsacrifice; by means of their tops (he sprinkles), for the top (is sacred) to\nthe gods.\n\n9:2:1:1313\\. And, again, as to why he sprinkles them;--of old, when the _Ri_\nshis, the vital airs, joined him together, they made that 'sa _g_ urabdiya'\n(oblation) 1 his special fore-share, and, when he had been built up, they made\nthis (sprinkling) his after-share: thus, in sprinkling him, he gratifies those\n_Ri_ shis, the vital airs, who, when he (Agni) had been built up, made this\nhis after-share. With sour curds, honey and ghee (he sprinkles): the\nsignificance of this has been explained.\n\n9:2:1:1414\\. [He sprinkles, with, Va _g_. S. XVII, 13, 14], 'The gods of the\ngods, the worshipful of the worshipful,'--'for they (the vital airs) are\nindeed the gods of (among) the gods, and the worshipful of the\nworshipful';--'who draw nigh unto the yearlong share,' for they do indeed draw\nnear to this their year-long share;--'not eaters of oblations,--at this\noffering of sacrificial food,'--for the vital airs, indeed, are not eaters of\noblations;--'may themselves drink of the honey and the ghee!'\n\np. 186\n\nthat is, 'should themselves drink of this honey and ghee.'\n\n9:2:1:1515\\. 'The gods who attained godhead over the gods,'--for these gods\nhave indeed attained a divine state over the gods; 'who are the forerunners of\nthis holy work,'--the holy work is this fire-altar (and sacrifice), and they\nare the forerunners thereof;--'without whom no dwelling-place becometh pure;'\nfor without the vital airs no dwelling-place becomes pure 1;--'they are not on\nthe backs of the sky and the earth,'--that is, 'they are neither in the sky\nnor on earth: whatever breathes therein they are.'\n\n9:2:1:1616\\. With two (verses) he sprinkles, two-footed is the Sacrificer, and\nthe Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with\nso much he thus sprinkles him.\n\n9:2:1:1717\\. He then descends again (from the altar), with (Va _g_. S. XVII,\n15), 'Givers of in-breathing, givers of off-breathing,'--for this Agni who has\nbeen built up is all these breathings; were he not to utter at this time this\n(declaration of) self-surrender, then that (Agni) would possess himself of\nthose breathings of his (the Sacrificer's); but now that he gives utterance to\nthis self-surrender, that (Agni) does not possess himself of those breathings\nof his;--'Givers of in-breathing, givers of off-breathing, givers of through-\nbreathing, givers of lustre, givers of room,'--he thereby says, 'A giver of\nthis thou art to me,'--'let thy darts burn\n\np. 187\n\nothers than us! unto us be thou bright and propitious!'--as the text, so the\nmeaning.\n\n9:2:1:1818\\. Having returned (to the hall-fire) he proceeds with the (forenoon\nperformance of the) Pravargya 1 and Upasad 1; and having performed the\nPravargya and Upasad, he hands to him (the Sacrificer) the fast-food or semi-\nfast-food. He then (proceeds) with the (afternoon performance of the)\nPravargya and Upasad, and having obtained the object for which he puts the\n(Pravargya-) cauldron on the fire, he sets out (the apparatus of) the\nPravargya.\n\n9:2:1:1919\\. Let him set it out on an island; for, when heated, that\n(cauldron) is suffering pain; and were he to set it out on this (earth) its\npain would enter this (earth); and were he to set it out on water, its pain\nwould enter the water; but when he sets it out on an island, then it does not\ninjure either the water or this (earth): in that he does not throw it into the\nwater, it does not injure the water; and in that the water goes all round it--\nwater being a means of soothing--it does not injure this earth;--let him\ntherefore set it out on an island.\n\n9:2:1:2020\\. But let him rather set it out on the fire-altar;--for that fire-\naltar is these worlds, and the enclosing-stones are the waters;--so that when\nhe sets it out on the fire-altar, he indeed sets it out on an island.\n\n9:2:1:2121\\. And, again, as to why he sets it out on the fire-altar;--that\nfire-altar is these worlds, and those Pravargya (vessels) are Agni (fire),\nVayu (wind), and \xc3\x82ditya (sun): hence, were he to set them out in any other\nplace than the fire-altar, he would place those gods outside these worlds; but\nin that he sets them\n\np. 188\n\nout on the fire-altar, he places those gods in these worlds.\n\n9:2:1:2222\\. And, again, as to why he sets it out on the fire-altar,--the\nPravargya is the head of the sacrifice, and this built-up fire-altar is the\nbody: hence were he to set it out in any other place than the fire-altar, he\nwould place that head away from that (body), but in that he sets it out on the\nfire-altar, he, having put together that body of him (Agni), restores the head\nto it.\n\n9:2:1:2323\\. The first Pravargya (vessel) he sets out close to the naturally-\nperforated (brick);--the naturally-perforated one is the breath, and the\nPravargya is the head, and this built-up Agni is the body: he thus connects\nand puts together the head and the body by means of (the channel of) the\nbreath. Having set out the Pravargya as is the way of its setting out,--\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[182:1](sbe4332.htm#fr_313) Or, 'Homage be to thy burning (consuming) fire!'\nas Mahidhara takes 'harase _s_ o _k_ ishe,' and perhaps also the Brahma _n_ a,\nthough 'etai _h_ ,' used in reference to Agni's weapons, would rather seem to\nindicate a plurality of them.\n\n[182:2](sbe4332.htm#fr_314) See VII, 2, 3, 4; [VIII, 6, 3,\n15](sbe4325.htm#8:6:3:15).\n\n[182:3](sbe4332.htm#fr_315) See III, 5, 2, 9-11; the libation of ghee there\noffered on the p. 183 uttara-vedi being preparatory to the leading forward of\nthe fire to the high-altar.\n\n[183:1](sbe4332.htm#fr_316) Each time he has poured out some of the ghee on\none of the corners, or in the centre, of the stone; he throws one of the chips\nof gold thereon, without looking at it.\n\n[183:2](sbe4332.htm#fr_317) That libation was made crosswise--first on the\nright shoulder, then on the left thigh, then on the right thigh, then on the\nleft shoulder, and finally in the centre, of the (navel of the) high-altar. In\nthe same way he offers crosswise on the svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a brick.\n\n[184:1](sbe4332.htm#fr_318) Inasmuch as 'barhis' is the sacrificial grass\nspread over the vedi, or altar-ground.\n\n[185:1](sbe4332.htm#fr_319) That is, the oblation (made on the bunch of\nsacrificial grass placed in the centre of the freshly ploughed altar-site,\nwhere the furrows meet) with the formula (Va _g_. S. XII, 74) beginning 'sa\n_g_ ur abdo.' See VII, 2, 3, 8.\n\n[186:1](sbe4332.htm#fr_320) It is doubtful in what sense the author\nunderstands this part of the verse. Mahidhara takes it to mean, 'without whom\nno body moves.'\n\n[187:1](sbe4332.htm#fr_322) For the Pravargya, see part i, p. 44 note; and the\nUpasads, part ii, p. 104 seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 2, 2.
