Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! Thus saying, the Lord of the World\nstopped. And Lak _s_ mi, Ganga and Sarasvati wept bitterly, embracing one\nanother. All of them then looked to S'ri Kri _sn_ a, and gave vent to their\nfeelings one by one with tears in their eyes, and with their hearts throbbing\nwith fears and sorrows.\n\n\n\n3-4. Sarasvati said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! What is now, the way out of this curse, so\nsevere and paining since our births? How long can helpless women live,\nseparated from their husbands? O Lord! I certainly say that I will sacrifice\nmy body when I go to Bharata, by taking recourse to yoga. The Mahatmas always\nprotect all the persons without fail.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n5-6. Ganga said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of the Universe! Why have I been abandoned by You.\nWhat fault have I committed? I will quit my body. And You will have to partake\nof the sin due to the killing of an innocent woman. He is surely to go to hell\neven if he be the Lord of all, who forsakes in this world an innocent wife.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7-15. Padma said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Thou art of the nature of Sattva Gu _n_ a in\nfullness; what wonder, then, how Thou hast become angry! However let Thou be\npleased now with Sarasvati and Ganga. Forgiveness is the best quality of a\ngood husband. I am ready just now to go to Bharata when Sarasvati has cursed\nme. But tell me, how long I will have to stay there? After how many days I\nshall be able to see again Thy lotus-feet? The sinners will wash away their\ndirts of sins in my waters by their constant baths and ablutions? By what\nmeans shall I be freed again and get back to Thy lotus-feet. How long shall I\nhave to remain in my part, the daughter of Dharma Dhvaja, at the expiry of\nwhich I will be able to see Thee again? How long shall I have to assume the\nform of Tulasi tree, the abode of Thine. O Thou, the Ocean of mercy! Say, when\nwilt Thou deliver me? And if Ganga have to go to Bharata, by the curse of\nBharata, when shall She be freed of the curse and sin and when shall She see\nback Thy feet? Again if Sarasvati have to go to Bharata out of Ganga's curse,\nwhen will that period of curse expire? How many days after shall She be able\nto come back to Thy feet? Now, be pleased to cancel Thy order for them to go\nto Brahma and S'iva respectively.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Thus speaking to Jagannatha, the\nDevi Kamala bowed down\n\n\n\np. 831\n\n\n\nat His feet and embracing them by Her own hairs of the bead, cried frequently.\n\n\n\n16-37. Now the lotus-navelled Hari, always eager to shew favour to the\ndevotees, smiled and with a gracious heart took up Padma on His breast and\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O Sures'vari! I will keep my own word, also I will act according as\nyou like. O Lotus-eyed! Hear. How the two ends can be made to meet. Let\nSarasvati go in her one part to have the form of a river and in her one half\npart to Brahma and remain with me in Vaiku _nt_ ha in Her full parts. Ganga\nwill have to go in one part to Bharata - to purify the three worlds as she\nwill be urged eagerly to do so by Bhagiratha. And She will remain in her one\npart in the matted hair of Chandra S'ekhara (the Mahadeva with Moon on his\nforehead), obtained with a great difficulty, and so will remain there purer\nthan her natural pure state. And let her remain with me in full parts. O\nPadme! O Lovely-eyed One! You are most innocent; so part of your part will go\nto Bharata and be the Padmavati river and you will be the Tulasi tree. After\nthe expiry of five thousand years of Kali Yuga, your curse will expire. Again\nyou all will come to My abode. O Padme! Calamities are the causes of the\nhappiness of the embodied beings. Without dangers no one can understand the\ntrue nature of happiness. The saint worshippers of My mantra who will perform\ntheir ablutions in your water will free you all of your curse by touch and\nsight. O Fair One! By the sight and touch (Dar _s_ an, Spars'an) of My bhaktas\n(devotees), all the sacred places of pilgrimages in the world will be\npurified. For uplifting and sanctifying the holy earth, My mantropasakas,\ni.e., S'aivas, S'aktas, Ga _n_ apatyas, etc., that are devoted to Brahma all\nare residing in Bharata. Where My Bhaktas reside and wash their feet, that\nplace is undoubtedly reckoned as the holy places of pilgrimages. So much so\nthat by the sight and touch of My devotees, the murderer of a woman, of a cow,\nof a Brahmin, the treacherous and even the stealer of the wife of one's Guru\nwill be sanctified and liberated while living. Those who do not perform the\nvow of Ekadas'i, who do not perform Sandhyas, who are Nastikas (atheists), the\nmurderers, all are free of their sins by the sight and touch of My devotees.\nBy the sight and touch of My devotees, those who live on their swords, pens,\nand the royal officials, the beggars in a village and the Brahma _n_ as who\ncarry (deal in) bullocks are also freed of their sins. The traitors, the\nmischief makers of their friends, those who give false evidence, those that\nsteal other's trust properties, are also freed of their sins by the sight and\ntouch of My devotees. Those who are foul-mouthed, bastards, the husbands and\nsons of unchaste women are all purified by the sight and touch of My Bhaktas.\nThe Brahmi _n_ cooks of S'udras, Brahmi _n_ s of an inferior order (who\nsubsist\n\n\n\np. 832\n\n\n\nupon the offerings made to the images which he attends), the village\nmendicants, those who are not initiated by their Gurus, these all are purified\nby the sight and touch of My devotees. O Fair One! The sins of those persons\nwho do not maintain their fathers, mothers, brothers, wives, sons, daughters,\nsisters, the blind, friends, the families of the Gurus, the fathers-in-law,\nthe mothers-in-law are also removed by the sight and touch of My devotees.\nThose that cut the As'vattha trees, that slander My devotees, and the Brahmi\n_n_ s that eat the food of S'udras, are also freed of their sins. Those who\nsteal the Deva's articles, the Brahma _n_ a's articles, those that sell lac,\niron, and daughters, those who commit Maha Patakas (Brahmahatya, Surapanam,\nSteyam, Gurbanganaganah, Mahanti patakanyahuh, tatsam-sargahseha Pa\xc3\xb1chamam)\nand those that burn the S'udra's dead bodies, these also are freed of their\nrespective sins by the sight and touch of My devotees.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n38-42. Maha Lak _s_ mi said :-- \xc2\x93O Thou gracious to faithful attendants! What\nare the characteristics, the marks of those Bhaktas of Thine that Thou hast\nspoken of just now whose sight and touch destroy instantly the Mahapatakas\n(five great sins), that are destroyed after a long time by the water of the\nTirthas and the earthen and stone images of the Gods. The sins of the vilest\nof men, devoid of Hari bhakti, vain and egoistic, cheats, hvpocrites,\nslanderers of saints, vicious souls are destroyed by your Bhaktas, whose touch\nand ablations sanctify the sacred places of pilgrimages; by the touch of the\ndust and water of whose feet, the earth is purified; whom the Bhaktas of\nBharata always pray to see; and there is nothing higher than the meeting of\nthose Bhaktas.\xc2\x94 Suta said :-- \xc2\x93O Great Ri _s_ i! Thus hearing the words of\nMaha Lak _s_ mi, the Lord smiled and began to speak about the secret things or\nthe marks of the Bhaktas.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n43-54. O Lak _s_ mi! The marks of the Bhaktas are all mentioned very hiddenly\nin S'rutis and Pura _n_ as. These are very sanctifying; destructive of sins,\ngiving happiness, devotion, and liberation. These are never to be described to\ndeceitful persons; these are the essences and to be kept hidden. But you are\nvery simple and like my life. I therefore speak to you. Hear. O Fair One! All\nthe Vedas declare him to be holy and the best of men, in whose ears are\npronounced from the mouth of a Guru, the Vi _sn_ u mantra. At the very moment\nof his being born into this world, one hundred generations back of that\nperson, whether they be at that time in heaven or hell, get instantaneous\nliberation and if any of them happen to be born then as Jivas, they become\nliberated at once while living and finally get Vi _sn_ upadam (the place of Vi\n_sn_ u). That mortal is My Bhakta (devotee) who is full of devotion to Me, who\nalways repeats My glories and acts according to My directions, who hears with\nall his heart My topics, and hearing which, whose mind dances with joy, whose\nvoice gets choked and\n\n\n\np. 833\n\n\n\ntears incessantly flow out from whose eyes, who loses his outward\nconsciousness. Such a man is indeed, My Bhakta. My Bhaktas do not long for\nhappiness or Mukti, or the four states Salokya, Sayujya, Samipya and Sar _st_\ni, nor the Brahmahood, nor the Devahood (the state of immortality); they want\nonly to do Seva (service) to Me and they are solely intent on doing this. Even\nin dreams they do not desire the Indraship, Manuship, the state of Brahma so\nvery difficult to be had; nor do they want the enjoyment of kingdoms and\nheavens. My Bhaktas roam in Bharata, eager to hear My glories, and always very\nglad to recite My sweet glorious deeds. The birth of such Bhaktas in Bharata\nis very rare. They purify the world and go ultimately to My abode, the best of\nall Tirthas (sacred places). Thus I have spoken O Padme! all that you wanted\nto hear. Now do as you like. Then Ganga and others all went to obey the order\nof Sri Hari, Who went to His own abode.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventh Chapter of the Ninth Book on the curses Ganga,\nSarasvati, and Lak _s_ mi and the way to freedom thereof in the Mahapura _n_\nam S'rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk09ch08.htm)\n\n"
