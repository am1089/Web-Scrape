Elderly people like you talk abundantly about\nthe good old days that were, and about the degeneracy of the days that are. I\nwonder what you would say if you could but look forward a few hundred years.\n\nBrahmans shall disgrace themselves by becoming soldiers and being killed, and\nServiles (Shudras) shall dishonour themselves by wearing the thread of the\ntwiceborn, and by refusing to be slaves; in fact, society shall be all "mouth"\nand mixed castes.[173] The courts of justice shall be disused; the great works\nof peace shall no longer be undertaken; wars shall last six weeks, and their\ncauses shall be clean forgotten; the useful arts and great sciences shall die\nstarved; there shall be no Gems of Science; there shall be a hospital for\ndestitute kings, those, at least, who do not lose their heads, and no\nVikrama----\n\nA severe shaking stayed for a moment the Vampire\'s tongue.\n\nHe presently resumed. Briefly, building tanks feeding Brahmans; lying when one\nought to lie; suicide, the burning of widows, and the burying of live\nchildren, shall become utterly unfashionable.\n\nThe consequence of this singular degeneracy, O mighty Vikram, will be that\nstrangers shall dwell beneath the roof tree in Bharat Khanda (India), and\nimpure barbarians shall call the land their own. They come from a wonderful\ncountry, and I am most surprised that they bear it. The sky which ought to be\ngold and blue is there grey, a kind of dark white; the sun looks deadly pale,\nand the moon as if he were dead.[174] The sea, when not dirty green, glistens\nwith yellowish foam, and as you approach the shore, tall ghastly cliffs, like\nthe skeletons of giants, stand up to receive or ready to repel. During the\ngreater pert of the sun\'s Dakhshanayan (southern declination) the country is\ncovered with a sort of cold white stuff which dazzles the eyes; and at such\ntimes the air is obscured with what appears to be a shower of white feathers\nor flocks of cotton. At other seasons there is a pale glare produced by the\nmist clouds which spread themselves over the lower firmament. Even the faces\nof the people are white; the men are white when not painted blue; the women\nare whiter, and the children are whitest: these indeed often have white hair.\n\n"Truly," exclaimed Dharma Dhwaj, "says the proverb, \'Whoso seeth the world\ntelleth many a lie.\'"\n\nAt present (resumed the Vampire, not heeding the interruption), they run about\nnaked in the woods, being merely Hindu outcastes. Presently they will change--\nthe wonderful white Pariahs! They will eat all food indifferently, domestic\nfowls, onions, hogs fed in the street, donkeys, horses, hares, and (most\nhorrible!) the flesh of the sacred cow. They will imbibe what resembles meat\nof colocynth, mixed with water, producing a curious frothy liquid, and a fiery\nstuff which burns the mouth, for their milk will be mostly chalk and pulp of\nbrains; they will ignore the sweet juices of fruits and sugar-cane, and as for\nthe pure element they will drink it, but only as medicine, They will shave\ntheir beards instead of their heads, and stand upright when they should sit\ndown, and squat upon a wooden frame instead of a carpet, and appear in red and\nblack like the children of Yama.[175] They will never offer sacrifices to the\nmanes of ancestors, leaving them after their death to fry in the hottest of\nplaces. Yet will they perpetually quarrel and fight about their faith; for\ntheir tempers are fierce, and they would burst if they could not harm one\nanother. Even now the children, who amuse themselves with making puddings on\nthe shore, that is to say, heaping up the sand, always end their little games\nwith "punching," which means shutting the hand and striking one another\'s\nheads, and it is soon found that the children are the fathers of the men.\n\nThese wonderful white outcastes will often be ruled by female chiefs, and it\nis likely that the habit of prostrating themselves before a woman who has not\nthe power of cutting off a single head, may account for their unusual\ndegeneracy and uncleanness. They will consider no occupation so noble as\nrunning after a jackal; they will dance for themselves, holding on to strange\nwomen, and they will take a pride in playing upon instruments, like young\nmusic girls.\n\nThe women, of course, relying upon the aid of the female chieftains, will soon\nemancipate themselves from the rules of modesty. They will eat with their\nhusbands and with other men, and yawn and sit carelessly before them showing\nthe backs of their heads. They will impudently quote the words, "By\nconfinement at home, even under affectionate and observant guardians, women\nare not secure, but those are really safe who are guarded by their own\ninclinations "; as the poet sang--\n\nWoman obeys one only word, her heart.\n\nThey will not allow their husbands to have more than one wife, and even the\nsingle wife will not be his slave when he needs her services, busying herself\nin the collection of wealth, in ceremonial purification, and feminine duty; in\nthe preparation of daily food and in the superintendence of household\nutensils. What said Rama of Sita his wife?" If I chanced to be angry, she bore\nmy impatience like the patient earth without a murmur; in the hour of\nnecessity she cherished me as a mother does her child; in the moments of\nrepose she was a lover to me; in times of gladness she was to me as a friend."\nAnd it is said, "a religious wife assists her husband in his worship with a\nspirit as devout as his own. She gives her whole mind to make him happy; she\nis as faithful to him as a shadow to the body, and she esteems him, whether\npoor or rich, good or bad, handsome or deformed. In his absence or his\nsickness she renounces every gratification; at his death she dies with him,\nand he enjoys heaven as the fruit of her virtuous deeds. Whereas if she be\nguilty of many wicked actions and he should die first, he must suffer much for\nthe demerits of his wife."\n\nBut these women will talk aloud, and scold as the braying ass, and make the\nhouse a scene of variance, like the snake with the ichneumon, the owl with the\ncrow, for they have no fear of losing their noses or parting with their ears.\nThey will (O my mother!) converse with strange men and take their hands; they\nwill receive presents from them, and, worst of all, they will show their white\nfaces openly without the least sense of shame; they will ride publicly in\nchariots and mount horses, whose points they pride themselves upon knowing,\nand eat and drink in crowded places--their husbands looking on the while, and\nperhaps even leading them through the streets. And she will be deemed the\npinnacle of the pagoda of perfection, that most excels in wit and\nshamelessness, and who can turn to water the livers of most men. They will\ndance and sing instead of minding their children, and when these grow up they\nwill send them out of the house to shift for themselves, and care little if\nthey never see them again.[176] But the greatest sin of all will be this: when\nwidowed they will ever be on the look-out for a second husband, and instances\nwill be known of women fearlessly marrying three, four, and five times.[177]\nYou would think that all this licence satisfies them. But no! The more they\nhave the more their weak minds covet. The men have admitted them to an\nequality, they will aim at an absolute superiority, and claim respect and\nhomage; they will eternally raise tempests about their rights, and if anyone\nshould venture to chastise them as they deserve, they would call him a coward\nand run off to the judge.\n\nThe men will, I say, be as wonderful about their women as about all other\nmatters. The sage of Bharat Khanda guards the frail sex strictly, knowing its\nfrailty, and avoids teaching it to read and write, which it will assuredly use\nfor a bad purpose. For women are ever subject to the god[178] with the sugar-\ncane bow and string of bees, and arrows tipped with heating blossoms, and to\nhim they will ever surrender man, dhan, tan--mind, wealth, and body. When, by\nexceeding cunning, all human precautions have been made vain, the wise man\nbows to Fate, and he forgets, or he tries to forget, the past. Whereas this\nrace of white Pariahs will purposely lead their women into every kind of\ntemptation, and, when an accident occurs, they will rage at and accuse them,\nkilling ten thousand with a word, and cause an uproar, and talk scandal and be\nscandalized, and go before the magistrate, and make all the evil as public as\npossible. One would think they had in every way done their duty to their\nwomen!\n\nAnd when all this change shall have come over them, they will feel restless\nand take flight, and fall like locusts upon the Aryavartta (land of India).\nStarving in their own country, they will find enough to eat here, and to carry\naway also. They will be mischievous as the saw with which ornament-makers trim\ntheir shells, and cut ascending as well as descending. To cultivate their\nfriendship will be like making a gap in the water, and their partisans will\never fare worse than their foes. They will be selfish as crows, which, though\nthey eat every kind of flesh, will not permit other birds to devour that of\nthe crow.\n\nIn the beginning they will hire a shop near the mouth of mother Ganges, and\nthey will sell lead and bullion, fine and coarse woollen cloths, and all the\nmaterials for intoxication. Then they will begin to send for soldiers beyond\nthe sea, and to enlist warriors in Zambudwipa (India). They will from\nshopkeepers become soldiers: they will beat and be beaten; they will win and\nlose; but the power of their star and the enchantments of their Queen Kompani,\na daina or witch who can draw the blood out of a man and slay him with a look,\nwill turn everything to their good. Presently the noise of their armies shall\nbe as the roaring of the sea; the dazzling of their arms shall blind the eyes\nlike lightning; their battle-fields shall be as the dissolution of the world;\nand the slaughter-ground shall resemble a garden of plantain trees after a\nstorm. At length they shall spread like the march of a host of ants over the\nland They will swear, "Dehar Ganga[179]!" and they hate nothing so much as\nbeing compelled to destroy an army, to take and loot a city, or to add a rich\nslip of territory to their rule. And yet they will go on killing and capturing\nand adding region to region, till the Abode of Snow (Himalaya) confines them\nto the north, the Sindhu-naddi (Incus) to the west, and elsewhere the sea.\nEven in this, too, they will demean themselves as lords and masters, scarcely\nallowing poor Samudradevta[180] to rule his own waves.\n\nRaja Vikram was in a silent mood, otherwise he would not have allowed such\nill-omened discourse to pass uninterrupted. Then the Baital, who in vain had\noften paused to give the royal carrier a chance of asking him a curious\nquestion, continued his recital in a dissonant and dissatisfied tone of voice.\n\nBy my feet and your head,[181] O warrior king! it will fare badly in those\ndays for the Rajas of Hindustan, when the red-coated men of Shaka[182] shall\ncome amongst them. Listen to my words.\n\nIn the Vindhya Mountain there will be a city named Dharmapur, whose king will\nbe called Mahabul. He will be a mighty warrior, well-skilled in the dhanur-\nveda (art of war)[183], and will always lead his own armies to the field. He\nwill duly regard all the omens, such as a storm at the beginning of the march,\nan earthquake, the implements of war dropping from the hands of the soldiery,\nscreaming vultures passing over or walking near the army, the clouds and the\nsun\'s rays waxing red, thunder in a clear sky, the moon appearing small as a\nstar, the dropping of blood from the clouds, the falling of lightning bolts,\ndarkness filling the four quarters of the heavens, a corpse or a pan of water\nbeing carried to the right of the army, the sight of a female beggar with\ndishevelled hair, dressed in red, and preceding the vanguard, the starting of\nthe flesh over the left ribs of the commander-in-chief, and the weeping or\nturning back of the horses when urged forward.\n\nHe will encourage his men to single combats, and will carefully train them to\ngymnastics. Many of the wrestlers and boxers will be so strong that they will\noften beat all the extremities of the antagonist into his body, or break his\nback, or rend him into two pieces. He will promise heaven to those who shall\ndie in the front of battle and he will have them taught certain dreadful\nexpressions of abuse to be interchanged with the enemy when commencing the\ncontest. Honours will be conferred on those who never turn their backs in an\nengagement, who manifest a contempt of death, who despise fatigue, as well as\nthe most formidable enemies, who shall be found invincible in every combat,\nand who display a courage which increases before danger, like the glory of the\nsun advancing to his meridian splendour.\n\nBut King Mahabul will be attacked by the white Pariahs, who, as usual, will\nemploy against him gold, fire, and steel. With gold they will win over his\nbest men, and persuade them openly to desert when the army is drawn out for\nbattle. They will use the terrible "fire weapon,[184]\'\' large and small tubes,\nwhich discharge flame and smoke, and bullets as big as those hurled by the bow\nof Bharata.[185] And instead of using swords and shields, they will fix\ndaggers to the end of their tubes, and thrust with them like lances.\n\nMahabul, distinguished by valour and military skill, will march out of his\ncity to meet the white foe. In front will be the ensigns, bells, cows\'-tails,\nand flags, the latter painted with the bird Garura,[186] the bull of Shiva,\nthe Bauhinia tree, the monkey-god Hanuman, the lion and the tiger, the fish,\nan alms-dish, and seven palm-trees. Then will come the footmen armed with\nfire-tubes, swords and shields, spears and daggers, clubs, and bludgeons. They\nwill be followed by fighting men on horses and oxen, on camels and elephants.\nThe musicians, the water-carriers, and lastly the stores on carriages, will\nbring up the rear.\n\nThe white outcastes will come forward in a long thin red thread, and vomiting\nfire like the Jwalamukhi.[187] King Mahabul will receive them with his troops\nformed in a circle; another division will be in the shape of a halfmoon; a\nthird like a cloud, whilst others shall represent a lion, a tiger, a carriage,\na lily, a giant, and a bull. But as the elephants will all turn round when\nthey feel the fire, and trample upon their own men, and as the cavalry\ndefiling in front of the host will openly gallop away; Mahabul, being thus\nwithout resource, will enter his palanquin, and accompanied by his queen and\ntheir only daughter, will escape at night-time into the forest.\n\nThe unfortunate three will be deserted by their small party, and live for a\ntime on jungle food, fruits and roots; they will even be compelled to eat\ngame. After some days they will come in sight of a village, which Mahabul will\nenter to obtain victuals. There the wild Bhils, famous for long years, will\ncome up, and surrounding the party, will bid the Raja throw down his arms.\nThereupon Mahabul, skilful in aiming, twanging and wielding the bow on all\nsides, so as to keep off the bolts of the enemy, will discharge his bolts so\nrapidly, that one will drive forward another, and none of the barbarians will\nbe able to approach. But he will have failed to bring his quiver containing an\ninexhaustible store of arms, some of which, pointed with diamonds, shall have\nthe faculty of returning again to their case after they have done their duty.\nThe conflict will continue three hours, and many of the Bhils will be slain:\nat length a shaft will cleave the king\'s skull, he will fall dead, and one of\nthe wild men will come up and cut off his head.\n\nWhen the queen and the princess shall have seen that Mahabul fell dead, they\nwill return to the forest weeping and beating their bosoms. They will thus\nescape the Bhils, and after journeying on for four miles, at length they will\nsit down wearied, and revolve many thoughts ir; their minds.\n\nThey are very lovely (continued the Vampire), as I see them with the eye of\nclear-seeing. What beautiful hair! it hangs down like the tail of the cow of\nTartary, or like the thatch of a house; it is shining as oil, dark as the\nclouds, black as blackness itself. What charming faces! likest to water-\nlilies, with eyes as the stones in unripe mangos, noses resembling the beaks\nof parrots, teeth like pearls set in corals, ears like those of the\nredthroated vulture, and mouths like the water of life. What excellent forms!\nbreasts like boxes containing essences, the unopened fruit of plantains or a\ncouple of crabs; loins the width of a span, like the middle of the viol; legs\nlike the trunk of an elephant, and feet like the yellow lotus.\n\nAnd a fearful place is that jungle, a dense dark mass of thorny shrubs, and\nropy creepers, and tall canes, and tangled brake, and gigantic gnarled trees,\nwhich groan wildly in the night wind\'s embrace. But a wilder horror urges the\nunhappy women on; they fear the polluting touch of the Bhils; once more they\nrise and plunge deeper into its gloomy depths.\n\nThe day dawns. The white Pariahs have done their usual work, They have cut off\nthe hands of some, the feet and heads of others, whilst many they have crushed\ninto shapeless masses, or scattered in pieces upon the ground. The field is\nstrewed with corpses, the river runs red, so that the dogs and jackals swim in\nblood; the birds of prey sitting on the branches, drink man\'s life from the\nstream, and enjoy the sickening smell of burnt flesh.\n\nSuch will be the scenes acted in the fair land of Bharat.\n\nPerchance two white outcastes, father and son, who with a party of men are\nscouring the forest and slaying everything, fall upon the path which the women\nhave taken shortly before. Their attention is attracted by footprints leading\ntowards a place full of tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, and wild dogs. And\nthey are utterly confounded when, after inspection, they discover the sex of\nthe wanderers.\n\n"How is it," shall say the father, "that the footprints of mortals are seen in\nthis part of the forest?"\n\nThe son shall reply, "Sir, these are the marks of women\'s feet: a man\'s foot\nwould not be so small."\n\n"It is passing strange," shall rejoin the elder white Pariah, "but thou\nspeakest truth. Certainly such a soft and delicate foot cannot belong to\nanyone but a woman."\n\n"They have only just left the track," shall continue the son, "and look! this\nis the step of a married woman. See how she treads on the inside of her sole,\nbecause of the bending of her ankles." And the younger white outcaste shall\npoint to the queen\'s footprints.\n\n"Come, let us search the forest for them," shall cry the father, "what an\nopportunity of finding wives fortune has thrown in our hands. But no! thou art\nin error," he shall continue, after examining the track pointed out by his\nson, "in supposing this to be the sign of a matron. Look at the other, it is\nmuch longer; the toes have scarcely touched the ground, whereas the marks of\nthe heels are deep. Of a truth this must be the married woman." And the elder\nwhite outcaste shall point to the footprints of the princess.\n\n"Then," shall reply the son, who admires the shorter foot, "let us first seek\nthem, and when we find them, give to me her who has the short feet, and take\nthe other to wife thyself."\n\nHaving made this agreement they shall proceed on their way, and presently they\nshall find the women lying on the earth, half dead with fatigue and fear.\nTheir legs and feet are scratched and torn by brambles, their ornaments have\nfallen off, and their garments are in strips. The two white outcastes find\nlittle difficulty, the first surprise over, in persuading the unhappy women to\nfollow them home, and with great delight, conformably to their arrangement,\neach takes up his prize on his horse and rides back to the tents. The son\ntakes the queen, and the father the princess.\n\nIn due time two marriages come to pass; the father, according to agreement,\nespouses the long foot, and the son takes to wife the short foot. And after\nthe usual interval, the elder white outcaste, who had married the daughter,\nrejoices at the birth of a boy, and the younger white outcaste, who had\nmarried the mother, is gladdened by the sight of a girl.\n\nNow then, by my feet and your head, O warrior king Vikram, answer me one\nquestion. What relationship will there be between the children of the two\nwhite Pariahs?\n\nVikram\'s brow waxed black as a charcoal-burner\'s, when he again heard the most\nirreverent oath ever proposed to mortal king. The question presently attracted\nhis attention, and he turned over the Baital\'s words in his head, confusing\nthe ties of filiality, brotherhood, and relationship, and connection in\ngeneral.\n\n"Hem!" said the warrior king, at last perplexed, and remembering, in his\nperplexity, that he had better hold his tongue--"ahem!"\n\n"I think your majesty spoke? " asked the Vampire, in an inquisitive and\ninsinuating tone of voice.\n\n"Hem!" ejaculated the monarch.\n\nThe Baital held his peace for a few minutes, coughing once or twice\nimpatiently. He suspected that the extraordinary nature of this last tale,\ncombined with the use of the future tense, had given rise to a taciturnity so\nunexpected in the warrior king. He therefore asked if Vikram the Brave would\nnot like to hear another little anecdote.\n\n"This time the king did not even say "hem!" Having walked at an unusually\nrapid pace, he distinguished at a distance the fire kindled by the devotee,\nand he hurried towards it with an effort which left him no breath wherewith to\nspeak, even had he been so inclined.\n\n"Since your majesty is so completely dumbfoundered by it, perhaps this acute\nyoung prince may be able to answer my question?" insinuated the Baital, after\na few minutes of anxious suspense.\n\nBut Dharma Dhwaj answered not a syllable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Conclusion.](vav16.htm)\n\n'
