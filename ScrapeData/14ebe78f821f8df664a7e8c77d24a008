Thee, O Agni, the men who love _Ri_ ta have kindled, the ancient ones thee\nthe ancient, for the sake of bliss, O (god) who art produced by strength; the\nhighly-brilliant, worshipful, in whom all refreshment dwells, the household\ngod, the lord of the house, the chosen.\n\n2\\. Thee, O Agni, the clans have set down, the ancient guest, the flame-haired\nlord of the house, with mighty light, with many shapes, the winner of prizes,\ngiving good shelter and good help, who is busy among the decayed (wood)\n[1](sbe46112.htm#an_5:8:2:1).\n\n3\\. Thee, O Agni, the human clans magnify, who knowest (the art of\nsacrificial) libations, who separatest (what was mixed)\n[1](sbe46112.htm#an_5:8:3:1), the highest bestower of treasures, who, (though)\ndwelling in secret, O blessed one, (yet) art visible to all, mightily roaring,\nan excellent sacrificer, shining with ghee.\n\n4\\. Thee, O Agni, the supporter, we always have praised with our songs and\nhave sat down near thee with adoration. Thus being kindled, O A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, be\npleased with us, as a god through the mortal's brilliant (offering)\n[1](sbe46112.htm#an_5:8:4:1), with thy glorious splendours.\n\n5\\. Thou, O Agni, manifold-shaped, bestowest vigour on every house in thy\nancient way, O much-praised one.! Thou rulest with might over much food. This\nimpetuousness of thine, when thou rushest forward impetuously, is not to be\ndefied.\n\n6\\. Thee, O Agni, when kindled, O youngest one, the gods have made their\nmessenger and bearer of\n\np. 386\n\noblations. Thee who extendest over wide spaces, who dwellest in ghee, into\nwhom offerings are poured, they have made their eye, impetuous, stirring\nthoughts.\n\n7\\. Thee, O Agni, on whom offerings of ghee are poured, (men) desirous of thy\nfavour have kindled from of old with good fuel. Thus, grown strong, increased\nby the plants, thou spreadest thyself over the terrestrial spaces.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, _G_ agati.--Verse 3 = TS. III, 3, 11, 2. Verses 6, 7\n= TB. I, 2, 1, 12.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The Padapa _th_ a gives _g_ arat-visham. I prefer this explanation to\n_g_ ara-dvisham ('who hates decay').\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Agni is, in the later ritual, worshipped as 'separator' (vivi _k_ i),\nif the sacrificer's fires have become mixed with other fires. See Taittiriya\nBrahma _n_ a III, 7, 3, 5; _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a XII, 4, 4, 2 (where this\nvery verse is quoted), &c.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. For ya _s_ asa, Bohtlingk-Roth conjecture ya _s_ asa, which seems to\nme a conjectura nimis facilis. I think that the adjective ya _s_ asa is right,\nand that a noun, meaning 'offering' or the like, should be supplied. Cf.\nabove, IV, 1, 16, note 4.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 9](sbe46113.htm)\n\n"
