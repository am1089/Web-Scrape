Soshyantim adbhir abhyukshaty e _g_ atu da _s_ amasya iti (Va _g_. Sa _m_\nh. VIII, 28) prag yasyai to iti (ibid. 29).\n\n2 2 Athavaravapatanam, avaitu p _ri_ _s_ ni _s_ evala _m_ _s_ une _g_ arayv\nattave, naiva ma _m_ sena pivari na kasmi _m_ _s_ _k_ anayatam ava _g_ arayu\npadyatam iti.\n\n3\\. When the boy is born, he performs for him, before the navel-string is cut\noff, the medha _g_ anana\n\np. 294\n\n[paragraph continues] (production of intelligence) and the ayushya (rite for\nprocuring long life).\n\n4 4. (The medha _g_ anana is performed in the following way:) With his fourth\nfinger and with (an instrument of) gold he gives (to the child) honey and\nghee, or ghee (alone), to eat with (the formulas), 'Bhu _h_ I put into thee;\nbhuva _h_ I put into thee; sva _h_ I put into thee. Bhur bhuva _h_ sva _h_\neverything I put into thee.'\n\n5\\. He then performs the ayushya.\n\n6\\. Near his navel or his right ear he murmurs: 'Agni is long-lived; through\nthe trees he is long-lived. By that long life I make thee long-lived.\n\n'Soma is long-lived; through the herbs he is, &c.\n\n'The Brahman is long-lived; through the Brahma _n_ as it is, &c.\n\n'The gods are long-lived; through ambrosia (am _ri_ ta) they are, &c.\n\n'The _Ri_ shis are long-lived; through their observances they are, &c.\n\n'The Fathers are long-lived; through the Svadha oblations (or oblations made\nto the Manes) they are, &c.\n\n'Sacrifice is long-lived; through sacrificial fee it is, &c.\n\n'The ocean is long-lived; through the rivers it is long-lived. By that long\nlife I make thee long-lived;'\n\n7\\. And three times the verse, 'The threefold age' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. III,\n62).\n\n8\\. If he desires, 'May he live his full term of\n\np. 295\n\nlife,' he should touch him with the Vatsapra hymn (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XII,\n18-29).\n\n9\\. From the Anuvaka beginning with 'From heaven' (XII, 18 seqq.) he omits the\nlast _Ri_ _k_ (XII, 29).\n\n10\\. Having placed five Brahma _n_ as towards the (five) regions, he should\nsay to them, 'Breathe ye upon this (child).'\n\n11 11. The (Brahma _n_ a placed) to the east should say, Up-breathing!\n\n12\\. The one to the south, 'Back-breathing!'\n\n13\\. The one to the west, 'Down-breathing!'\n\n14\\. The one to the north, 'Out-breathing!'\n\n15\\. The fifth one, looking upwards, should say, 'On-breathing!'\n\n16\\. Or (the father) may do that himself, going round (his child), if he can\nfind no (Brahma _n_ as).\n\n17 17. He recites over the place at which (the child) is born: 'I know, O\nearth, thy heart that dwells in heaven, in the moon. That I know; may it know\nme. May we see a hundred autumns; may we live a hundred autumns; may we hear a\nhundred autumns.'\n\n18 18. He then touches him with (the verse), 'Be a stone, be an axe, be\nimperishable gold. Thou indeed art the Self called son; thus live a hundred\nautumns.'\n\np. 296\n\n19 19. He then recites over his mother (the verse), 'Thou art I _d_ a, the\ndaughter of Mitra and Varu _n_ a; thou strong woman hast born a strong son. Be\nthou blessed with strong children, thou who hast blessed us with a strong\nson.'\n\n20\\. He then washes her right breast, and gives it to the child with (the\nverse), 'This breast' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XVII, 87);\n\n21 21. The left (breast) with (the verse), 'Thy breast which' (ibid. XXXVIII,\n5)\xc2\x97with these two (verses).\n\n22\\. He puts down a pot of water near her head with (the verse), 'O waters,\nyou watch with the gods. As you watch with the gods, thus watch over this\nmother who is confined, and her child.'\n\n23 23. Having established near the door the fire that has been kept from (the\nwife's) confinement, he throws into that fire at the time of the morning and\nevening twilight, until (the mother) gets up (from childbed), mustard seeds\nmixed with rice chaff (pronouncing the following names of demons and goblins):\n'May _S_ a _n_ _d_ a and Marka, Upavira, _S_ au _n_ _d_ ikeya, Ulukhala,\nMalimlu _k_ a, Dro _n_ asa, _K_ yavana vanish hence. Svaha!\n\n'May \xc3\x82likhat, Animisha, Ki _m_ vadanta, Upa _s_ ruti, Haryaksha, Kumbhin, _S_\natru, Patrapa _n_ i, N _ri_ ma _n_ i, Hantrimukha, Sarshaparu _n_ a, _K_\nyavana vanish hence. Svaha!'\n\n24 24. If (the demon bringing disease) Kumara attacks the boy, the father\ncovers him with a net\n\np. 297\n\nor with an upper garment, takes him on his lap, and murmurs: Kurkura,\nSukurkura, Kurkura, who holds fast children. _K_ et! _k_ et! doggy! let him\nloose. Reverence be to thee, the Sisara, barker, bender.\n\n'That is true that the gods have given a boon to thee. Hast thou then chosen\neven this boy?\n\n' _K_ et! _k_ et! doggy! let him loose. Reverence be to thee, the Sisara,\nbarker, bender.\n\n'That is true that (the divine she-dog) Sarama is thy mother, Sisara thy\nfather, the black and the speckled (two dogs of Yama) thy brothers.\n\n' _K_ et! _k_ et! doggy! let him loose. Reverence be to thee, the Sisara,\nbarker, bender.'\n\n25\\. He then touches (the boy) with (the words), 'He does not suffer, he does\nnot cry, he is not stiff, he is not sick, when we speak to him and when we\ntouch him.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[293:1](sbe29170.htm#fr_741) 16, 1. _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a XIV, 9, 4, 22.\n\n[293:2](sbe29170.htm#fr_742) Atharva-veda I, II, 4.\n\n[294:4](sbe29170.htm#fr_743) Comp. _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a XIV, 9, 4, 23\nseqq.
