This (aggregate of the elements) (continues to exist) up to the (final\nabsolute) union (with Brahman); on account of the declarations of the sa _m_\nsara state (made by scripture).\n\nWith regard to the final clause, 'Heat in the highest deity,' the force of its\nconnexion with what precedes shows that the meaning is 'the heat of the dying\nman is--together with the individual soul, the pra _n_ a, the aggregate of the\norgans and the other elements--merged in Brahman.'--We now have to consider of\nwhat kind that merging is.--The purvapakshin maintains that it is an absolute\nabsorption of the things merged, since it is proved that those things have the\nhighest deity for their causal matter. For it has been established that the\ndeity is the causal substance of all things that have an origin. Hence that\npassing into the state of non-separation is an absolute one.\n\nTo this we reply as follows. Those subtle elements--heat and so on--which\nconstitute the abode of hearing and the other organs persist up to the\n'union,' i.e. up to final release from the sa _m_ sara, which is caused by\nperfect knowledge. 'On account of the declarations of the sa _m_ sara state'\nmade in passages such as 'Some enter the womb, for embodied existence as\norganic beings; others go into inorganic matter, according to their work and\naccording to their knowledge' (Ka. Up. II, 5, 7). Otherwise the limiting\nadjuncts of every soul would, at the time of death, be absorbed and the soul\nwould enter into absolute union with Brahman; which would render all\nscriptural injunction and scriptural doctrine equally purportless. Moreover\nbondage, which is due to wrong knowledge, cannot be dissolved but through,\nperfect knowledge. Hence, although Brahman is the causal substance of those\nelements, they are at the time of death--as in the case of deep sleep and a\npralaya of the world--merged in it only in such a way as to continue to exist\nin a seminal condition.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 9](sbe38289.htm)\n\n"
