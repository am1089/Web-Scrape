'Be queen with thy father-in-law,' with this verse (Rig-veda X, 85, 46)\nher father or brother sacrifices with a sword's point on her head, or with the\nSruva, standing while she is sitting, with his face turned to the west, while\nher face is turned to the east.\n\n2\\. 'I seize thy hand for the sake of happiness' (Rig-veda X, 85, 36), with\nthese words (the bridegroom) seizes with his right hand her right hand with\nthe thumb, both hands being turned with the palms upwards, he standing while\nshe is sitting, with his face turned to the west, while her face is turned to\nthe east.\n\n3\\. And when he has murmured the following five verses,\n\n4 4. (He continues thus,) 'This am I, that art thou;\n\np. 36\n\nthat art thou, this am I; the heaven I, the earth thou; the _Ri_ _k_ art thou,\nthe Saman I. So be thou devoted to me.\n\n'Well! Let us here marry. Let us beget offspring. Let us acquire many sons who\nmay reach old age.'\n\n5\\. (The \xc3\x82 _k_ arya) fills, with the words bhur bhuva _h_ sva _h_ , a new\nwater-pot,\n\n6 6. Throws into it (branches) with milky sap and leaves, of a tree the name\nof which is masculine, together with Ku _s_ a grass,\n\n7\\. And gold, according to some (teachers),\n\n8\\. And hands it over to a student who observes silence.\n\n9 9. They should walk round this Stheya water, (placed) to the north-east, so\nthat they turn their right sides . towards it.\n\np. 37\n\n10\\. And after (the \xc3\x82 _k_ arya) has placed a stone towards the northern\ndirection,\n\n11\\. (The bridegroom) makes her rise with the words, 'Come, thou joyful one,'\n\n12\\. And makes her tread with the tip of her right foot on the stone, with the\nwords, 'Come, tread on the stone; like a stone be firm. Tread the foes down;\novercome the enemies.'\n\n13\\. He then leads her round the fire so that their right sides are turned to\nit,\n\n14\\. And gives her a second garment with the same text (chap. 12, \xc2\xa7 3).\n\n15\\. Her father or brother pours out of a basket fried grain mixed with _S_\nami leaves into her joined hands.\n\n16\\. The spreading under, the sprinkling over, and the second sprinkling over\n(are done) with \xc3\x82 _g_ ya.\n\n17 17. She sacrifices those (fried grains).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[35:4](sbe29015.htm#fr_78) 13, 4. Naraya _n_ a states that here four Brahma\n_n_ as should repeat p. 36 the Surya hymn (Rig-veda X, 85) to the bride. That,\naccording to _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, that hymn is recited at the wedding, is clear from\nchap. 14, 12.\n\n[36:6](sbe29015.htm#fr_79) Sakshirant sapala _s_ ant saku _s_ an. Naraya _n_\na's commentary divides sa ku _s_ an, and refers sa to the a _k_ arya. But this\nsa would be superfluous, and the substantive to which sakshiran and sapala _s_\nan are to be referred, is, as both the nature of the case and the\ncorresponding passages show, _s_ akhan and not ku _s_ an. Comp. the _S_ rauta-\nsutra IV, 17, 5: palasa _s_ akha _m_ sapala _s_ a _m_ nikhaya, and a passage\nconcerning the very rite here described, \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-pari _s_ ish _t_ a I,\n24: audumbaryarddhaya. (read, ardraya?) _s_ akhaya sapala _s_ aya sahira _n_\nyapavitraya sadurvapavitraya. The MS. of the _S_ ambavya-sutra has sakshiran\npala _s_ an saku _s_ an.\n\n[36:9](sbe29015.htm#fr_80) 'The Stheya water has to be so placed that when the\nbride and the bridegroom walk (their seven steps, see chap. 14, 5 seq.), their\nright sides are turned towards it.' Naraya _n_ a. Comp., regarding the Stheya\nwater and its bearer, the G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha-pari _s_ ish _t_ a II, 26.\n30. 35.\n\n[37:17](sbe29015.htm#fr_81) I believe that the words forming this Sutra, ta\n_\xc3\xb1_ _g_ uhoti, are taken from the same lost old G _ri_ hya text which _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana has followed word for word also in I, 5, 1-5 and elsewhere. This is\nmade probable by the comparison of Paraskara I, 6, 2. The author of our text,\nwhile literally adopting the words of his original, has not quite succeeded in\nwelding them together with his own statements; thus the sacrifice of grains is\ntreated of in this Sutra and in the first Sutra of the next chapter, as if\nthere were two different acts, while indeed it is one and the same.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 14](sbe29016.htm)\n\n"
