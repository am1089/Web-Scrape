The Himalayas said :-- "O Mother! Now describe your Bhaki Yoga, by which\nordinary men who have no dispassion get the knowledge of Brahma easily.\n\n2-10. The Devi said:--"O Chief of Mountains! There are three paths, widely\nknown, leading to the final liberation (Mok _s_ a). These are Karma Yoga,\nJ\xc3\xb1ana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga. Of these three, Bhakti Yoga is the easiest in all\nrespects; people can do it very well without incurring any suffering to the\nbody, and bringing the mind to a perfect concentration. This Bhakti (devotion)\nagain is of three kinds as the Gu _n_ as are three. His Bhakti is Tamasi who\nworships Me, to pain others, being filled with vanity and jealousy and anger.\nThat Bhakti is Rajasic, when one worships Me for one\'s own welfare and does\nnot intend to do harm to others. He has got some desire or end in view, some\nfame or to attain some objects of enjoyments and ignorantly, and thinking\nhimself different from Me, worships Me with greatest devotion. Again that\nBhakti is Sattviki when anybody worships Me to purify his sins, and offers to\nMe the result of all his Karmas, thinking that Jiva and \xc3\x8es\'vara are separate\nand knowing that this action of his is authorized in the Vedas and therefore\nmust be observed. This Sattviki Bhakti is different from the Supreme Bhakti as\nthe worshippers\n\np. 729\n\nthink Me separate; but it leads to the Supreme Bhakti. The other two Bhaktis\ndo not lead to Para Bhakti (the Supreme Bhakti or the Highest unselfish Love.)\n\n11-20. Now hear attentively about the Para Bhakti that I am now describing to\nyou. He who hears always My Glories and recites My Name and whose mind dwells\nalways, like the incessant flow of oil, in Me Who is the receptacle of all\nauspicious qualities and Gu _n_ as. But he has not the least trace of any\ndesire to get the fruits of his Karma; yea he does not want Samipya, Sar _st_\ni, Sayujya, and Salokya and other forms of liberations! He becomes filled with\ndevotion for Me alone, worships Me only; knows nothing higher than to serve Me\nand he does not want final liberation even. He does not like to forsake this\nidea of Sevya (to he served) and Sevaka (servant who serves). He always\nmeditates on Me with constant vigilance and actuated by a feeling of Supreme\nDevotion; he does not think himself separate from Me but rather thinks himself\n"that I am the Bhagavati." He considers all the Jivas as Myself and loves Me\nas he loves himself. He does not make any difference between the Jivas and\nmyself as he finds the same Chaitanya everywhere and mainfested in all. He\ndoes not quarrel with anybody as he has abandoned all ideas about\nseparateness; he bows down, and worships the Chandalas and all the Jivas. He\nwho becomes filled with devotion to Me whenever he sees My place, My devotees,\nand hears the Sastras, describing My deeds, and whenever he meditates on My\nMantras, he becomes filled with the highest love and his hairs stand on their\nends out of love to Me and tears of love flow incessantly from both his eyes;\nhe recites My name and My deeds in a voice, choked with feelings of love for\nMe. [ _N. B._ \\--The Para Prema Bhakti is like the maddening rush of a river\nto the Ocean; thence in the shape of vapour to the highest; Himalayan Mountain\npeaks to be congealed into snow where various plays of bright colours take\nplace.]\n\n21-30. O Lord of the mountains! He worships Me with intense feeling as the\nMother of this Universe and the Cause of all causes. He performs the daily and\noccasional duties and all My vows and sacrifices without showing any miserly\nfeeling in his expenditure of money. He naturally longs to perform My\nfestivities and to visit places where My Utsabs are held. He sings My name\nloudly and dances, being intoxicated with My love, and has no idea of egoism\nand is devoid of his body-idea, thinking that the body is not his. He thinks\nthat whatever is Prarabdha (done in his previoas lives) must come to pass and\ntherefore does not become agitated as to the preservation of his body and\nsoul. This sort of Bhakti is called the Para Bhakti or the Highest Devotion.\nHere the\n\np. 730\n\npredominent idea is the idea of the Devi and no other idea takes its place. O\nMountain! He gets immediately dissolved in My Nature of Consciousness whose\nheart is really filled with such Para Bhakti or All Love. The sages call the\nlimiting stage of this devotion and dispassion as J\xc3\xb1ana (knowledge). When this\nJ\xc3\xb1ana arises, Bhakti and dispassion get their ends satisfied. Yea! He goes\nthen to the Ma _n_ i Dvipa, when his Ahamkara does not crop up by his\nPrarabdba Karma, though he did not fail to give up his life in devotion. O\nMountain! That man enjoys there all the objects of enjoyments, though\nunwilling and at the end of the period, gets the knowledge of My\nConsciousness. By that he attains the Final Liberation for ever. Without this\nJ\xc3\xb1ana, the Final Liberation is impossible.\n\n31-33. He realises Para Brahma who gets in this body of his the above J\xc3\xb1ana of\nthe Pratyak \xc3\x82tma in his heart; when his Pra _n_ a leaves his body, he does not\nget re-birth. The S\'ruti says :-- "He, who knows Brahma, becomes Brahma." In\nthe logic of Kan _t_ ha, Chamikara, (gold on the neck) the ignorance vanishes.\nWhen this ignorance is destroyed by knowledge, he attains all his knowledge\nthe object to be attained, when he recoginises the gold on his neck.\n\n34-37. O Best of Mountains! This My consciousness is different from the\nperceived pots, etc., and unperceived Maya. The image of this Paramatma is\nseen in bodies other than the \xc3\x82tma as the image falls in a mirror; as the\nimage falls in water, so this Paramatma is seen in the Pitrilokas. As the\nshadow and light are quite distinct, so in My Ma _n_ idvipa, the knowledge of\noneness without a second arises. That man resides in the Brahma Loka for the\nperiod of a Kalpa who leaves his body without attaining J\xc3\xb1ana, though he had\nhis Vairagyam. Then he takes his birth in the family of a pure prosperous\nfamily and practising again his Yoga habits, gets My Consciousness.\n\n38-45. O King of Mountains! This J\xc3\xb1ana arises after many births it does not\ncome in one birth; so one should try one\'s best to get this J\xc3\xb1ana. If,\nattaining this rare human birth, one does not attain this J\xc3\xb1ana, know that a\ngreat calamity has befallen to him. For this human birth is very hard to\nattain; and then the birth in a Brahmi _n_ family is rarer; moreover amongst\nthe Brahmi _n_ s, the knowledge of the Veda (the Consciousness is exceedingly\nrare.) The attaining of the six qualities (which are considered as six\nwealth), restraint of passions, etc.; the success in Yoga and the acquisition\nof a pure real Guru, all these are very hard to be attained in this life. O\nMountain! The maturity and the activities of the organs of the senses, and the\npurification of the body according to the Vedic rites are all very difficult\nto attain. Know this again that to get a desire for final liberation is\nacquired by the merits acquired in many births. That man\'s birth is entirely\nfutile, who attaining all the above qualifications does not try his best to\nattain this J\xc3\xb1ana, So one should\n\np. 731\n\ntry one\'s best to acquire the J\xc3\xb1ana. Then, at every moment, he gets the fruits\nof the As\'vamedha sacrifice. There is no doubt in this. As _ghee_ (clarified\nbutter) resides potentially in milk, so the Vij\xc3\xb1ana Brahma resides in every\nbody. So make the mind the churning rod and always churn with it. Then, by\nslow degrees, the knowledge of Brahma will be attained.\n\nMan attains blessedness when he gets this J\xc3\xb1ana; so the Vedanta says: Thus I\nhave described to you in brief, O King of Mountains! all that you wanted to\nhear. Now what more do you want?\n\nHere ends the Thirty-seventh Chapter of the Seventh Book on the glories of\nBhakti in the Maha Pura _n_ am, S\'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 Verses, by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 38](bk07ch38.htm)\n\n'
