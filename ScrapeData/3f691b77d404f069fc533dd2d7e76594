Of him who has merely read the Veda.\n\nNor is there any force in the argument that knowledge is only auxiliary to\nwork because works are enjoined on him who possesses knowledge. For the text\nwhich refers to the man 'who has read the Veda' enjoins works on him who has\nmerely _read_ the texts, and _reading_ there means nothing more than the\napprehension of the aggregate of syllables called Veda, without any insight\ninto their meaning. A man who has thus mastered the words of the Veda\napprehends therefrom that it makes statements as to works having certain\nresults, and then on his own account\n\np. 692\n\napplies himself to the enquiry into the meaning of those declarations; he who\nis desirous of work applies himself to the knowledge of works; he who is\ndesirous of Release applies himself to the knowledge of Brahman. And even if\nthe injunction of _reading_ were understood as prompting to the understanding\nof the text also, all the same, knowledge would not be a subsidiary to works.\nFor _knowledge_ , in the sense of the Upanishads, is something different from\nmere cognition of sense. In the same way as the performance of such works as\nthe _G_ yotish _t_ oma sacrifice is something different from the cognition of\nthe true nature of those works; so that vidya, which effects the highest\npurpose of man, i. e. devout meditation (dhyana, upasana), is something\ndifferent from the mere cognition of the true nature of Brahman. Knowledge of\nthat kind has not the most remote connexion even with works.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13. Not so, on account of non-specification](sbe48460.htm)\n\n"
