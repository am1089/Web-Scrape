Janamejaya asked :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! I have heard all that you have described\nabout the sweet nectar-like characters of the Kings of the Solar and the Lunar\ndynasties. Now kindly describe the real Tattva of the Vira _t_ Form of the\nGreat Devi and how She was worshipped in every Manvantara by the Regent of\nthat Manvantara and the Kings thereof. In what part of the year and in which\nplace, under what circumstances and in what form and with what Mantras was the\nDevi worshipped? I am very anxious to hear all this. O Guru! In fact describe\nthe gross forms of the \xc3\x82dya S'akti, the Devi Bhagavati by concentrating\nattention to Which, I can have the power to understand the subtle forms of the\nDevi and I can get the highest good in this world.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n5-7. Vyasa said :-- O King! Now hear. I am describing to you in detail about\nthe worship of the Devi Bhagavati that leads to the welfare of the Whole\nWorld; the hearing of which or the practice of which enables one to get the\nhighest good. In days of yore, the Devar _s_ i Narada asked Naraya _n_ a about\nthis very point; I will now tell you what the Bhagavan, the Promulgator of the\nYoga Tattva, advised Narada. Once on a time the all powerful Devar _s_ i\nNarada entitled with all the Yogic powers, and born from the body of Brahma\nwas travelling all over this earth and came to the hermitage of the Ri _s_ i\nNaraya _n_ a. Resting a while, and the troubles of the journey over, he bowed\ndown to the Yogi Naraya _n_ a and asked Him what you ask me now. Narada said\n:-- O Deva Deva Mahadeva! O Thou, the Ancient Puru _s_ a, the Excellent One!\n\n\n\n8-9. O Omniscient ! O Thou, the Holder of the Universe! O Thou Who art the\nrepository of the good qualities and Who art praised by all!\n\n\n\n10-12. O Deva! Now tell me what is the ultimate cause of this Universe: whence\nhas this Universe its origin? And how does it rest? To whom does it take\nrefuge? Where does it dissolve in the time of Pralaya? Where do all the Karmas\nof these beings go to? And what Object is that whose knowledge destroys\nforever the Maya, the Cause\n\n\n\np. 742\n\n\n\nof all this Moha (illusion)? Whose worship, what Japam, and Whose meditation\nin the lotus of heart are to he made, by which, O Deva! the knowledge of\nParamatman rises in the heart, as the darkness of the night vanishes by the\nrising of the Sun.\n\n\n\n13\\. O Deva! Kindly reply to these my questions in such a clear manner as the\nignorant people in this Samsara can understand and get themselves across this\nocean of Samsara.\n\n\n\n14-15. Vyasa said :-- Thus asked by the Devar _s_ i, the ancient Naraya _n_ a,\nthe Best of the Munis, the great Yogi gladly spoke :-- O Devar _s_ i! Hear I\nwill now speak to you all the Tattvas of this world, knowing which the mortal\nnever falls into the illusion of this world.\n\n\n\n16\\. O Child! The original cause of this Universe is the Devi Maha Maya (the\nimage of the Supreme Chaitanya Para Brahma); this is the opinion of the Ri _s_\nis, the Devas, Gandharvas, and other intelligent persons.\n\n\n\n17-23. It is written in the Vedas and other S'astras that the Devi Bhagavati,\nworshipped by all in the Universe, creates, preserves and destroys the\nUniverse by the influence of Her three Gu _n_ as. I now describe to you the\nnature of the Devi, worshipped by the Siddhas, Gandharbas and Ri _s_ is, the\nmere remembering of Whom destroys all sins, and gives final liberation Mok _s_\na (and Dharma, Artha, and Kama also). The powerful Svayambhuva Manu, the\nFirst, the husband of S'atarupa, the prosperous and the Ruler of all the\nManvantaras worshipped the sinless Prajapati Brahma, his Father with due\ndevotion and satisfied Him when the Grandsire of the Lokas, the Hira _n_\nyagarbha spoke to his son :-- The excellent worship of the Devi should be done\nby you. By Her Grace, O Son, your work of creating worlds will be successful.\nThus spoken by Brahma, the Bibhu Svayambhuva Manu, the Vira _t_ incarnate,\nworshipped the World Mother with great austerities. And with his concentrated\ndevotion, he satisfied the Devi Deves'i and began to chant hymns to Her, the\nFirst-born, the Maya, the S'akti of all, and the Cause of all causes.\n\n\n\n24-36. Manu said :-- Thou art Brahma, the ocean of the Vedas, Kri _sn_ a, the\nabode of Lak _s_ mi, Purandara. I bow down again and again to Thee, the\nDeves'i, the Cause of Maya, the Cause of this Universe. Thou holdest s'ankha\n(the conchshell), chakra, gada, etc., in Thy hands and Thou residest in the\nheart of Naraya _n_ a; Thou art the Vedas incarnate, the World Mother, the\nAuspicious One, bowed down by all the Devas, and the Knower of the Three\nVedas. O Thou, endowed with all\n\n\n\np. 743\n\n\n\npowers and glory! O Mahamaye! Mahabhage! Mahodaye! (the Self-manifested). Thou\nresidest as the better half of Maha Deva, and Thou dost all what are dear to\nHim. Thou art the most beloved of Nanda, the Cow-herd (in the form of Maha\nMaya, the daughter who concealed Kri _sn_ a and slipped from the hands of\nKamsa and got up in the air and remained as Vindhyavasini; also in the form of\nS'ri Kri _sn_ a). Thou gavest much pleasure and wert the cause of all the\nfestivities; Thou takest away the fear due to plague, etc.; Thou art\nworshipped by the Devas. O Thou, the auspicious Bhagavati! Thou art the\nwelfare of all incarnate; Thou fructifiest the desires of all to success! Thou\nart the One to Whom all take refuge and Thou removest their all the dangers; O\nThou the three-eyed! Gauri! Narayani! Obeisance to Thee. I bow down to that\nocean of all brightness and splendour, without beginning or end, the One\nConsciousness, wherein this endless Universe rises and remains interwoven\ntherein. I bow down to the Devi, whose Gracious Glance enables Brahma, Vi _sn_\nu, and Mahes'vara to do their respective works of creating, preserving, and\ndestroying the Universe. O Devi! Thou art the Only One, whom all can bow,\nsince the lotus-born Brahma, terrified by the horrible Daityas, was freed by\nThy prowess only. O Bhagavati! Thou art modesty, fame, memory, lustre; Thou\nart Lak _s_ mi, Girija, the daughter of Himalaya, Thou art Sati, the Dak _s_\na's daughter; Thou art the Savitri the Mother of the Vedas, Thou art the\nintelligence of all and Thou art the cause of fearlessness. So I now engage\nmyself reciting Thy Japam, Thy hymns and Thy worship. I meditate on Thee and\nsee Thy form within my heart and hear Thy praises. Be graciously pleased on\nme, O Devi! It is by Thy Grace that Brahma is the Revealer of the Four Vedas,\nVi _sn_ u is the Lord of Lak _s_ mi, Indra is the Lord of the Devas and of the\nthree worlds; Varu _n_ a is the Lord of waters, Kuvera is the Lord of wealth,\nYama is the Lord of the dead, Nairrita is the Lord of the Rak _s_ asas, and\nSoma is the Lord of the water element and praised by the three worlds.\nTherefore, O Auspicious World Mother! I bow down again and again to Thee.\n\n\n\n37-45. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Child! When Svayambhuva Manu, the son of\nBrahma, chanted thus the hymns to the \xc3\x82dya S'akti Bhagavati Narayani, She\nbecame pleased and spoke to him thus :-- The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93O King, the\nBrahma's son! I am pleased with your devoted worship and hymns; so ask boon\nfrom Me that you desire.\xc2\x94 Manu said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! If Thou art graciously\npleased, grant that my creation be finished without any hitch.\xc2\x94 The Devi said\n:-- \xc2\x93O King of Kings! By My blessing, your work of creation will be completed\nwithout any obstruction. And by your pu _n_ ya (merits) they will no doubt\nmultiply on and on. He who reads\n\n\n\np. 744\n\n\n\nwith devotion this hymn (stotra) composed by you, will get sons, fame and\nbeauty in the world and, in the end, he will be entitled to get the Highest\nPlace. The people will have powers unopposed by anybody, will get wealth and\ngrains, will get victory everywhere and happiness; and his enemies will be\nruined.\xc2\x94 Naraya _n_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Child! The Devi Bhagavati \xc3\x82dya S'akti\ngranted thus the desired boon to Svayambhuva Manu and vanished away at once\nfrom his sight.\xc2\x94 Then the powerful Manu, obtaining thus the boon, spoke to his\nfather :-- O Father! Now give me a solitary place where I can worship the Devi\nwith sacrifices and do my work of creating a good number of people.\n\n\n\n46-48. Hearing thus the words of the son, the Prajapati, the Lord thought over\nthe matter for a long time :-- \xc2\x93How this work would be done? Alas! I have\nspent an endless time in this work of creation; but as yet nothing has been\ndone. For the Earth, the receptacle of all the Jivas is submerged in water and\nhas gone down to the Rasatala. What is to be done now? There is only one hope\nand that is this :-- If the Bhagavan, the Primeval Person, under Whose Command\nI am engaged in this work of creation, helps me in this work of mine, no doubt\nit will be accomplished then and then only.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the First Chapter of the Eighth Book on the description of the\nworlds in the Mahapura _n_ am, S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk08ch02.htm)\n\n"
