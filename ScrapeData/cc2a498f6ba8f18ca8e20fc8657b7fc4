By the sole nature of intelligence (the soul manifests itself), as that is\nits Self; thus Au _d_ ulomi (opines).\n\nAlthough the text enumerates different qualities, such as freeness from sin,\n&c., these qualities rest only on fanciful conceptions due to difference of\nwords; for what the text intimates is only absence in general of all qualities\nsuch as sin and the rest. Intelligence alone constitutes the nature of the\nSelf, and hence it is proper to conclude that it manifests itself in a nature\nconsisting of that only. This conclusion will also agree with other scriptural\ntexts, such as B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 13. 'Thus this Self has neither inside nor\noutside, but is altogether a mass of knowledge.' Qualities, on the other hand,\nsuch as having true wishes, are indeed mentioned by the text as real\n(positive) attributes, the meaning being that his wishes are true, i.e. truly\nexistent; but all the same they, as depending on the connexion with limiting\nadjuncts, cannot constitute the true nature of the\n\np. 410\n\n[paragraph continues] Self, as intelligence does. For all manifoldness of\ncharacter has to be denied of Brahman, as we have shown under III, 2, 11. For\nthe same reason the mention made of eating and so on, means only the absence\nof all pain in general, and aims at glorification, just as the passage about\n'loving the Self' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 25, 2). For love, play, and the like cannot\nin their literal sense be ascribed to the action of the Self, because they\npresuppose something second (beyond the Self). Hence the soul manifests itself\nin the nature of pure intelligence, free from all manifoldness, calm, not\ncapable of being expressed by any terms. This is the view of the teacher Au\n_d_ ulomi.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 7](sbe38324.htm)\n\n"
