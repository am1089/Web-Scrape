Yoga, as a technical term, means\napplication, concentration, effort; the idea that it meant originally union\nwith the deity has long been given up. This Yoga, however, was soon elaborated\ninto an artificial system, and though supplying the means only that are\nsupposed to be helpful for philosophy, it has been elaborated into a complete\nsystem of philosophy, the Yoga philosophy ascribed to Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali, a variety\nof Kapila's Sa _m_ khya-philosophy. As described by Svamin Ramak _ri_ sh _n_\nananda in the Brahmavadin, p. 511 seq., it consists, as practised at present,\nof four kinds--Mantra, Laya, Ra _g_ a, and Ha _th_ a-yoga. Mantra-yoga\nconsists in repeating a certain word again and again, particularly a word\nexpressive of deity, and concentrating all one's thoughts on it. Laya-yoga is\nthe concentration of all our thoughts on a thing or the idea of a thing, so\nthat we become almost one with it. Here again the ideal image of a god, or\nnames expressive of the Godhead, are the best, as producing absorption in God.\nRa _g_ a-yoga consists in controlling the breath so as to control the mind. It\nwas observed that when fixing our attention suddenly on anything new we hold\nour breath, and it was supposed therefore that concentration of the mind would\nbe sure to follow the holding back of the breath, or the Pra _n_ ayama. Ha\n_th_ a-yoga is concerned with the general health of the body, and is supposed\nto produce concentration by certain portions of\n\np. 9\n\nthe body, by fixing the eyes on one point, particularly the tip of the nose,\nand similar contrivances. All this is fully described in the Yoga-Sutras, a\nwork that gives one the impression of being perfectly honest. No doubt it is\ndifficult to believe all the things which the ancient Yogins are credited\nwith, and the achievements of modern Yogins also are often very startling. I\nconfess I find it equally difficult to believe them or not to believe them. We\nare told by eye-witnesses and trustworthy witnesses that these Yogins go\nwithout food for weeks and months, that they can sit unmoved for any length of\ntime, that they feel no pain, that they can mesmerise with their eyes and read\npeople's thoughts. All this I can believe, but if the same authorities tell us\nthat Yogins can see the forms of gods and goddesses moving in the sky, or that\nthe ideal God appears before them, that they hear voices from the sky,\nperceive a divine fragrance, and lastly that they have been seen to sit in the\nair without any support, I must claim the privilege of St. Thomas a little\nlonger, though I am bound to say that the evidence that has come to me in\nsupport of the last achievement is most startling 1.\n\nThat what is called a state of Samadhi, or a trance, can be produced by the\nvery means which are employed by the Yogins in India, is, I believe, admitted\nby medical and psychiatric authorities; and though impostors certainly exist\namong the Indian Yogins, we should be careful not to treat all these Indian\nSaints as mere impostors. The temptation, no doubt, is great for people, who\nare believed\n\np. 10\n\nto be inspired, to pretend to be what they are believed to be, nay, in the\nend, not only to pretend, but really to believe what others believe of them.\nAnd if they have been brought up in a philosophical atmosphere, or are filled\nby deep religious feelings, they would very naturally become what the\nMahatmans are described to be--men who can pour out their souls in perfervid\neloquence and high-flown poetry, or who are able to enter even on subtle\ndiscussions of the great problems of philosophy and answer any questions\naddressed to them.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[9:1](rls06.htm#fr_3) See also H.
