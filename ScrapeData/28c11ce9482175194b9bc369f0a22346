And for the same reason all (sense-organs) (follow) after (mind).\n\n'Therefore he whose light has gone out comes to a new birth with his senses\nmerged in the mind' (Pr. Up. III, 9); this passage states that all senses\nwithout difference are merged in the mind. 'For the same reason,' i.e. because\nthere also as in the case of speech, it is observed that the eye and so on\ndiscontinue their functions, while the mind together with its functions\npersists, and because the organs\n\np. 366\n\nthemselves cannot be absorbed, and because the text admits of that\ninterpretation; we conclude that the different organs follow after, i.e. are\nmerged in, the mind only as far as their functions arc concerned.--As all\norgans 1 without difference are merged in the mind, the special mention made\nof speech (in Sutra 1) must be viewed as made in agreement with the special\nexample referred to by scripture, 'Speech is merged in mind.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[366:1](sbe38282.htm#fr_219) I.e. the functions of all organs.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 3](sbe38283.htm)\n\n"
