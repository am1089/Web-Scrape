The absence (of a body and sense-organs, on the part of the released)\nBadari (asserts); for thus scripture says.\n\nThe passage, 'By his mere wish the fathers rise,' shows that the released\npossesses a mind (internal organ, manas) whereby he wills. A question however\narises whether he\n\np. 412\n\nwho knows, after having reached lordly power, possesses a body and senses, or\nnot. Here the teacher Badari is of opinion that the glorified possessor of\nknowledge is without body and sense-organs.--Why so?--Because scripture\ndeclares this, With the mind seeing those wishes he rejoices' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 12, 5). If he rejoiced with the mind, the body, and the senses,\nscripture would not specially say 'with the mind.' Hence there are neither\nbody nor sense-organs in the state of release.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 11](sbe38327.htm)\n\n"
