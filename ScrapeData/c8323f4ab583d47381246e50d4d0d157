Professor Wilson\nobserves ( _Vishnu Pur ana_, p. 139. Dr. Hall\'s Edition) \'States, and tribes,\nand cities have disappeared, even from recollection; and some of the natural\nfeatures of the country, especially the rivers, have undergone a total\nalteration.\n\nNotwithstanding these impediments, however, we should be able to identify at\nleast mountains and rivers, to a much greater extent than is now practicable,\nif our maps were not so miserably defective in their nomenclature. None of our\nsurveyors or geographers have been oriental scholars. It may be doubted if any\nof them have been conversant with the spoken language of the country. They\nhave, consequently, put down names at random, according to their own\ninaccurate appreciation of sounds carelessly, vulgarly, and corruptly uttered;\nand their maps of India are crowded with appellations which bear no similitude\nwhatever either to past or present denominations. "We need not wonder that we\ncannot discover Sanskrit names in English maps, when, in the immediate\nvicinity of Calcutta, Barnagore represents Barahanagar, Dakshineswar is\nmetamorphosed into Duckinsore, Ulubaria into Willoughbury.......There is\nscarcely a name in our Indian maps that does not afford proof of extreme\nindifference to accuracy in nomenclature, and of an incorrectness in\nestimating sounds, which is, in some degree, perhaps, a national defect.\'\n\nFor further information regarding the road from Ayodhya to Rajagriha, see\n_Additional Notes_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXX.: Bharat\'s Departure.](ry148.htm)\n\n'
