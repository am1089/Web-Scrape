The Dhish _n_ ya-hearths 4, forsooth, are no other\n\np. 149\n\nthan its (the sacrifice\'s) congeners 1. They have the same marks, and those\nwhich have the same marks are congeners; and these, then, are those\n(corresponding limbs) of its trunk.\n\n3:6:2:22\\. Now Soma was in heaven, and the gods were here on earth. The gods\ndesired, \'Would that Soma might come to us; we might sacrifice with him, when\ncome.\' They produced those two illusions, Supar _n_ i and Kadru 2; Supar _n_\ni, forsooth, was Va _k_ (speech) 3, and Kadru was this (earth). They caused\ndiscord between them.\n\n3:6:2:33\\. They then disputed and said, \'Which of us shall spy furthest, shall\nwin the other 4.\'--\'So be it!\' Kadru then said, \'Espy thou!\'\n\n3:6:2:44\\. Supar _n_ i said, \'On yonder shore of this ocean there stands a\nwhite horse at a post, that I see; doest thou also see it?\'--\'I verily do!\'\nThen said Kadru \'Its tail was just now hanging down; there, now the wind\ntosses it, that I see.\'\n\n3:6:2:55\\. Now when Supar _n_ i said, \'On yonder shore of this ocean,\' the\nocean, forsooth, is the altar, she thereby meant the altar; \'there stands a\nwhite horse at a post,\' the white horse, forsooth, is Agni, and the post means\nthe sacrificial stake. And when Kadru said, \'Its tail was just now hanging\ndown;\n\np. 150\n\nthere, now the wind tosses it, that I see;\' this is nothing else than the\nrope.\n\n3:6:2:66\\. Supar _n_ i then said, \'Come, let us now fly thither to know which\nof us is the winner.\' Kadru said, \'Fly thou thither; thou wilt tell us, which\nof us is the winner.\'\n\n3:6:2:77\\. Supar _n_ i then flew thither; and it was even as Kadru had said.\nWhen she had returned, she (Kadru) said to her, \'Hast thou won, or\nI?\'--\'Thou!\' she replied. Such is the story called Supar _n_ i-Kadrava 1.\'\n\n3:6:2:88\\. Then said Kadru, \'Verily I have won thine own self; yonder is Soma\nin the heaven: fetch him hither for the gods, and thereby redeem thyself from\nthe gods 2!\'--\'So be it!\' She brought forth the metres; and that Gayatri\nfetched Soma from heaven.\n\n3:6:2:99\\. He was enclosed between two golden cups 3; sharp-edged they closed\ntogether at every twinkling of the eye; and these two, forsooth, were\nConsecration and Penance. Those Gandharva Soma-wardens watched over him; they\nare these hearths, these fire-priests.\n\n3:6:2:1010\\. She tore off one of the two cups, and gave it to the gods,--this\nwas Consecration: therewith the gods consecrated themselves,\n\np. 151\n\n3:6:2:1111\\. She then tore off the second cup, and gave it to the gods,--this\nwas Penance: therewith the gods underwent penance, to wit the Upasads, for the\nUpasads are penance.\n\n3:6:2:1212\\. She took possession (a- _k_ akhada) 1 of Soma by means of (a\nstick of) khadira wood (Acacia Catechu), whence (the name) Khadira; and\nbecause she thereby took possession of him, therefore the sacrificial stake\nand the wooden sword (sphya) are of khadira wood.\n\nShe then carried him off while he was under the charge of the A _kh_ avaka,\nwherefore this A _kh_ avaka priest was excluded (from drinking Soma).\n\n3:6:2:1313\\. Indra and Agni preserved him for the production of creatures,\nwhence the A _kh_ avaka priest belongs to Indra and Agni.\n\n3:6:2:1414\\. Therefore the consecrated keep charge of the king (Soma), \'lest\n(the Gandharvas) should carry him off.\' Let him therefore guard him\ndiligently, for verily in whosesoever charge they carry him off, he is\nexcluded (from the Soma).\n\n3:6:2:1515\\. Wherefore the students guard their teacher, his house, and\ncattle, lest he should be taken from them. Let him therefore guard him (Soma)\ndiligently in that place, for verily in whosesoever charge they carry him off,\nhe is excluded therefrom. By means of him Supar _n_ i redeemed herself from\nthe gods; wherefore they say, \'He who has sacrificed shares in the world of\nbliss.\'\n\np. 152\n\n3:6:2:1616\\. Verily, even in being born, man, by his own self, is born as a\ndebt (owing) to death. And in that he sacrifices, thereby he redeems himself\nfrom death, even as Supar _n_ i then redeemed herself from the gods.\n\n3:6:2:1717\\. The gods worshipped with him. Those Gandharva Soma-wardens came\nafter him; and having come up they said, \'Do ye let us share in the sacrifice,\nexclude us not from the sacrifice; let there be for us also a share in the\nsacrifice!\'\n\n3:6:2:1818\\. They said, \'What will there be for us, then?\'--\'Even as in yonder\nworld we have been his keepers, so also will we be his keepers here on earth!\'\n\n3:6:2:1919\\. The gods spake, \'So be it!\' By saying, \'(Here are) your Soma-\nwages . . .\' he assigns to them the price of the Soma 1. They then said unto\nthem, \'At the third pressing an offering of ghee shall fall to your share, but\nnot one of Soma, for the Soma-draught has been taken from you, wherefore ye\nare not worthy of a Soma-offering!\' And accordingly, when he pours ghee on the\nhearths by means of fagots 2, at the evening libation, that same offering of\nghee falls to their share, but not one of Soma.\n\n3:6:2:2020\\. \'And what they will offer in the fire that will satiate you;\'\nhence that which they offer in the fire satiates them. \'And when they will\nmove about, holding the Soma over each 3, that will satiate you;\' hence when\nthey move about, holding the Soma over each (hearth), that satiates them.\n\np. 153\n\n[paragraph continues] Wherefore let not the Adhvaryu pass between 1 the\nhearths, for the Adhvaryu carries the Soma, and they sit waiting for him\n(Soma) with open mouths, and he would enter into their open mouths; and either\nAgni would burn him, or else that god who rules over beasts (Rudra) would seek\nafter him; hence whenever the Adhvaryu should have business in the hall, let\nhim pass north of the \xc3\x82gnidhra shed.\n\n3:6:2:2121\\. Now it is for the protection of Soma that those (hearths) are\nthrown up, to wit the \xc3\x82havaniya in front (on the high altar), the Mar _g_\naliya in the south, and the \xc3\x82gnidhriya in the north; and those that are in the\nSadas (protect him) from behind.\n\n3:6:2:2222\\. They are in part raised 2, in part they are assigned 3. And, in\ntruth, they themselves insisted thereon, saying, \'They shall in part raise us,\nand in part they shall assign us; thus we shall know again that heavenly world\nfrom which we have come, thus we shall not go astray.\'\n\n3:6:2:2323\\. And whichever of them are raised they are\n\np. 154\n\nthereby visibly in this world; but whichever of them are assigned they are\nthereby visibly in yonder world.\n\n3:6:2:2424\\. They have two names; for, in truth, they themselves insisted\nthereon, saying, \'We have not prospered with these names, since Soma has been\ntaken away from us; well, then, let us take each a second name!\' They took\neach a second name, and therewith prospered, inasmuch as they from whom the\nSoma-draught had been taken had a share in the sacrifice assigned to them;\nhence they have two names. Wherefore let a Brahman, if he prosper not, take a\nsecond name, for verily he prospers, whosoever, knowing this, takes a second\nname.\n\n3:6:2:2525\\. Now what he offers in the fire, that he offers unto the gods,\nthereby the gods exist; and what (Soma) is consumed in the Sadas, that he\noffers unto men, thereby men exist; and in that the Nara _s_ a _m_ sa 1 cups\nof Soma) stand with the Soma-carts, thereby he offers unto the Fathers,\nthereby the Fathers exist.\n\n3:6:2:2626\\. But those creatures which are not admitted to the sacrifice are\nforlorn; wherefore he now admits to the sacrifice those creatures here on\nearth that are not forlorn; behind 2 the men are the beasts; and behind the\ngods are the birds, the plants, and\n\np. 155\n\nthe trees; and thus whatsoever exists here on earth all that is admitted to\nthe sacrifice. And verily both the gods and men, and the Fathers drink\ntogether 1, and this is their symposium; of old they drank together visibly,\nbut now they do so unseen.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[148:4](sbe2624.htm#fr_394) There are altogether eight dhish _n_ yas, two of\nwhich, viz. the \xc3\x82gnidhra and the Mar _g_ aliya, are raised north and south of\nthe back part of the cart-shed (havirdhana) respectively; while the other six\nare raised inside the Sadas along the east side of it, viz. five of them north\nof the \'spine,\' belonging (from south to north) to the Hot _ri_ , Brahma _n_ a\n_kh_ a _m_ si, Pot _ri_ , Nesh _t_ _ri_ , and A _kh_ avaka respectively; and\none south of the spine, exactly south-east of the Udumbara post, for the\nMaitravaru _n_ a (or Pra _s_ ast _ri_ ) priest. These six priests, together\nwith the \xc3\x82gnidhra, are called the \'seven Hot _ri_ s.\' The \xc3\x82gnidhra and Mar _g_\naliya have square sheds with four posts erected over them, open on the east\nside and on the side facing the cart-shed. The \xc3\x82gnidhra hearth is thrown up\nfirst, and the Mar _g_ aliya last of all; and the Maitravaru _n_ a\'s\nimmediately after that of the Hot _ri_. For the formulas by which they are\nconsecrated, see Va _g_. S. V, 32, 32.\n\n[149:1](sbe2624.htm#fr_395) That is, the parts of the body corresponding to\none another, as arms, loins, &c.\n\n[149:2](sbe2624.htm#fr_396) See [III, 2, 4, 1](sbe2610.htm#3:2:4:1) seq.;\nOldenberg, Zeitsch. d.
