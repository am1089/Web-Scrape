The Hot _ri_ who is found on the Hot _ri_ \'s seat has sat down (there),\nthe fierce, the resplendent, the dexterous one, the protector of (his own)\ninfallible laws [1](sbe46059.htm#an_2:9:1:1), the highest Vasu, he who brings\nthousandfold (gain), the pure-tongued Agni.\n\n2\\. Be thou our messenger, be our protector far and wide; be thou, O bull, a\nleader towards greater wealth. O Agni! for the continuation of our children\nand of ourselves be thou an unremitting, brilliant protector.\n\n3\\. May we worship thee at thy highest birth (-place), O Agni; may we worship\nthee with praises in thy lower abode. I honour the womb from which thou hast\nsprung. When thou hast been kindled, they have offered offerings in thee.\n\n4\\. Agni, being the best sacrificer perform thou the sacrifice with the\noblation. With thy readiness to hear (us) hail our gift, the wealth (which we\noffer). For thou art the treasure-lord of treasures; thou art the deviser of\nbrilliant speech.\n\n5\\. Thy wealth of both kinds [1](sbe46059.htm#an_2:9:5:1) never fails, when\nthou art born (kindled) day by day, "O wonderful one. Make thy singer, O Agni,\nrich in food; make him the lord of wealth with excellent offspring.\n\n6\\. With this face of thine, as a bounteous (lord), a sacrificer to the gods,\nthe best performer of sacrifices with happiness, as an undeceivable guardian\nand far-reaching protector, shine among us, O Agni, with light and wealth.\n\np. 216\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh.--According to an observation of\nBergaigne\'s, hymns of six verses composed in Trish _t_ ubh should precede\nhymns of the same extent composed in Gayatri. Though this law is not without\nexceptions (see H. O., Die Hymnen des Rigveda, I, 202 seq.), the suspicion is\nraised that the hymns 9 and 10 should each be divided into two T _ri_ _k_ as.\n--Verse 1 = VS. XI, 36; TS. III, 3, 11, 2; IV, 1, 3, 3; MS. II, 7, 3. Verse 2\n= TS. III, 5, 11, 2; MS. IV, 10, 4. Verse 3 = VS. XVII, 75; TS. IV, 6, 5, 4;\nMS. II, 10, 6. Verse 6 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 2; MS. IV, 10, 5.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The long compound looks suspicious; possibly it should be read\nadabdhavrata _h_ pramati _h_.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Vasu and dhana frequently receive the epithet ubhaya; see VI, 19, 10;\nVII, 82, 4; 83, 5; X, 84, 7. No doubt celestial and terrestrial goods are\nreferred to, see II, 14, 11; V, 68, 3; VI, 59, 9; VII, 97, 10; IX, 19, 1; 100,\n3.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 19](sbe46060.htm)\n\n'
