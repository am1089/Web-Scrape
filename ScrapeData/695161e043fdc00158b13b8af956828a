The Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O Suta! Your words sound wonderful to us indeed!\nbut you have not as yet definitely spoken to us the original events in detail;\nso a great doubt has arisen in our minds. We know that the king S\xc2\x92antanu\nmarried Vyasa's mother, Satyavati. Now say, in detail in how Vyasa became her\nson? How such a chaste woman Satyavati, remaining in her own house, came to be\nmarried again by S\xc2\x92antanu? and how the two sons came to be born of S\xc2\x92antanu's\nsperm and Satyavati's' ovum? Now O highly fortunate Suvrata? Kindly describe\nin detail this highly sanctifying historical fact. These Ri _s_ is, who are\nobserving vows, are desirous to hear of the birth of Veda Vyasa and\nSatyavati.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n6-23. Suta said :-- I bow down with devotion to the Highest Primordial Force,\nthe bestower of the four fold aims of existence of human life, who grants to\nall, their desires when so prayed by the help of the Vagbhava Vijamantra with\ntheir heart and soul, for the success of all their desires. The above vija is\nso potent in its effect that even pronounced very lightly, even under a\npretext, it grants all siddhis. So the Devi should be remembered by all means;\nand now saluting Her, I begin my narration of the auspicious Pura _n_ ic\nevents. In days gone by there reigned a king, named Uparichara; he ruled over\nthe Chedi country and respected the Brahmins; he was truthful and very\nreligious. Indra, the lord of the Devas, became very pleased by his asceticism\nand presented him an auspicious celestial car (going in the air) made of\npearls, and crystals, helping him in doing what he liked best. Mounting on\nthat divine chariot, that religious king used to go everywhere; he never\nremained on earth; he used to remain always in the atmosphere and therefore be\nhad his name as \xc2\x93Uparichara Vasu\xc2\x94 (moving in the upper regions). He had a very\nbeautiful wife, named Girika; and five powerful sons, of indomitable vigour,\nwere born to him.\n\n\n\nThe king give separate kingdoms to each of his sons and made them kings. Once\non an occasion, Girika, the wife of the Uparichara Vasu, after her bath after\nthe menstruation and becoming pure came to the\n\n\n\np. 79\n\n\n\nking and informed him of her desire to get a son; but that very day his Pitris\n(ancestors) requested him also to kill deer, etc., for their Sraddha (solemn\nobsequies performed in honour of the manes of deceased ancestors). Hearing the\nPitris, the king of Chedi became somewhat anxious for his menstruous wife; but\nthinking his Pitris words more powerful and more worthy to be obeyed, went out\non an hunting expedition to kill deer and other animals, with the thought of\nhis wife Girika in his breast. Then while he was in the forest, he remembered\nhis Girika, who was equal in her beauty and loveliness to Kamala, and the\nemission of semen virile took place. He kept this semen on the leaf of a\nbanyan tree and thought \xc2\x93How the above semen be not futile; my semen cannot\nremain unfruitful; my wife has just now passed her menstruous condition; I\nwill send this semen to my dear wife.\xc2\x94 Thus thinking the time ripe, he closed\nthe semen under the leaves of the banyan tree and charging it with the mantra\npower (some power) addressed a falcon close by thus :-- \xc2\x93O highly fortunate\none! Take this my semen virile and go to my palace. O Beautiful one! Do this\nmy work: take this semen virile and go quick to my palace and hand it over to\nmy wife Girika for to-day is her menstruation period.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n24\\. Suta said :-- \xc2\x93O Ri _s_ is! Thus saying, the king gave that leaf with the\nvirile therein to the falcon, who is capable of going quick in the air, took\nit and immediately rose high up in the air.\n\n\n\n25-26. Another falcon, seeing this one flying in the air with leaf in his\nbeak, considered it to be some piece of flesh and fell upon him. Immediately a\ngallant fighting ensued between the two birds with their beaks.\n\n\n\n27\\. While the fighting was going on, that leaf with semen virile fell down\nfrom their beaks on the waters of the Jumna river. Then the two faIcons flew\naway as they liked.\n\n\n\n28-39. O Ri _s_ is! While the two falcons were fighting with each other, one\nApsara (celestial nymph) named Adrika came to a Brahmin, who was performing\nhis Sandhya Bandanam on the banks of the Jumna. That beautiful woman began to\nbathe in the waters and took a plunge for playing sports and caught hold of\nthe feet of the Brahma _n_ a. The Dvija, engaged in Pra _n_ ayama (deep\nbreathing exercise), saw that the woman had amorous intentions, and cursed\nher, saying :-- \xc2\x93As you have interrupted me in my meditation, so be a fish.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nAdrika, one of the best Apsaras, thus cursed, assumed the form of a fish\nSafari and spent her days in the Jumna waters. When the semen virile of\nUparichara Vasu fell from the beak of the falcon, that fish Adrika came\n\n\n\np. 80\n\n\n\nquickly and ate that and became pregnant. When ten months passed, a fisherman\ncame there and caught in a net that fish Adrika. When the fish's belly was\ntorn asunder, two human beings instantly came out the the womb. One was a\nlovely boy and the other a beautiful girl. The fisherman was greatly\nastonished to see this. He went and informed the king of that place who was\nUparichara Vasu that the boy and the girl were born of the womb of a fish. The\nking also was greatly surprised and accepted the boy who seemed auspicious.\nThis Vasu's son was highly energetic and powerful, truthful and religious like\nhis father and became famous by the name of the king Matsyaraj. Uparichara\nVasu gave away the girl to the fisherman. This girl was named Kali and she\nbecame famous by the name of Matsyodari. The smell of the fish came out of her\nbody and she was named also Matsyagandha. Thus the auspicious Vasu's daughter\nremained and grew in that fisherman's house.\n\n\n\nThe Ri _s_ is __ said :-- The beautiful Apsara, cursed by the Muni, turned\ninto fish; she was afterwards cut asunder and eaten up by the fisherman. Very\nwell! What happened afterwards to that Apsara? How was she freed of that\ncurse? and how did she go back to the Heavens?\n\n\n\nThus questioned by the Ri _s_ is, __ Suta spoke as follows :-- When the Apsara\nwas first cursed by the Muni, she was greatly astonished; she began to weep\nand cry like one greatly distressed and afterwards began to praise him. The\nBrahmi _n_ , seeing her weeping, took pity on her and said :-- \xc2\x93O good one!\nDon't weep; I am telling you how your curse will expire. As an effect of\nhaving incurred my wrath, you will be born as a fish and when you will give\nbirth to two human children, you will be freed of your curse.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThe Brahmin having spoken thus, Adrika got a fish-body in the waters of the\nJumna. Afterwards she gave birth to two human children and became freed of the\ncurse when she, quitting the fish form assumed the divine form and went up to\nthe Heavens. O Ri _s_ is! The beautiful girl Matsyagandha thus took her birth\nand was nourished in the fisherman's house and grew up there. When the\nextraordinarily lovely girl of Vasu, Matsyagandha attained her youth, she\ncontinued to do all the household duties of the fisherman and remained there.\n\n\n\nThus ends the first chapter of the Second Skandha on the birth of Matsyagandha\nin the Mahapura _n_ a S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk02ch02.htm)\n\n"
