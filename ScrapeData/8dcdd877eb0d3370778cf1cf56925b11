 \nSome pity to thy suitor show,  \nFor love's hot flames within me glow.  \nThis isle a hundred leagues in length,  \nEncompassed by the ocean's strength,  \nWould all the Gods and fiends defy  \nThough led by Him who rules the sky.  \nNo God in heaven, no sage on earth,  \nNo minstrel of celestial birth,  \n\np. 295  \n\nNo spirit in the worlds I see  \nA match in power and might for me.  \nWhat wilt tbou do with Rama, him  \nWhose days are short, whose light is dim,  \nExpelled from home and royal sway,  \nWho treads on foot his weary way?  \nLeave the poor mortal to his fate.  \nAnd wed thee with a worthier mate.  \nMy timid love, enjoy with me  \nThe prime of youth before it flee.  \nDo not one hour the hope retain  \nTo look on Rama's face again.  \nFor whom would wildest thought beguile  \nTo seek thee in the giants' isle?  \nSay who is he has power to bind  \nIn toils of net the rushing wind.  \nWhose is the mighty hand will tame  \nAnd hold the glory of the flame?  \nIn all the worlds above, below.  \nNot one, O fair of form, I know  \nWho from this isle in fight could rend  \nThe lady whom these arms defend.  \nFair Queen, o'er Lanka's island reign,  \nSole mistress of the wide domain.  \nGods, rovers of the night like me,  \nAnd all the world thy slaves will be.  \nO'er thy fair brows and queenly head  \nLet conscerating balm be shed,  \nAnd sorrow banished from thy breast,  \nEnjoy my love and take thy rest.  \nHere never more thy soul shall know  \nThe memory of thy former woe,  \nAnd here shall thou enjoy the meed  \nDeserved by every virtuous deed.  \nHere garlands glow of flowery twine,  \nWith gorgeous hues and scent divine.  \nTake gold and gems and rich attire:  \nEnjoy with me thy heart's desire.  \nThere stand, of chariots far the best,  \nThe car my brother once possessed.  \nWhich, victor in the stricken field,  \nI forced the Lord of Gold to yield.  \n'Tis wide and high and nobly wrought,  \nBright as the sun and swift as thought.  \nTherein O Sita, shalt tbou ride  \nDelighted by thy lover's side.  \nBut sorrow mars with lingering trace  \nThe splendour of thy lotus face.  \nA cloud of woe is o'er it spread,  \nAnd all the light of joy is fled.'  \n   The lady, by her woe distressed,  \nOne corner of her raiment pressed  \nTo her sad cheek like moonlight clear.  \nAnd wiped away a falling tear.  \nThe rover of the night renewed  \nHis eager pleading as he viewed  \nThe lady stand like one distraught,  \nStriving to fix her wandering thought:  \n' Think not, sweet Lady, of the shame  \nOf broken vows, nor fear the blame.  \nThe Saints approve with favouring eyes  \n\nThis union knit with marriage ties.  \nO beauty, at thy radiant feet  \nI lay my heads, and thus entreat.  \nOne word of grace, one look I crave:  \nHave pity on thy prostrate slave.  \nThese idle words I speak are vain,  \nWrung forth by love's consuming pain,  \nAnd ne'er of Ravan be it said  \nHe wooed a dame with prostrate head.'  \nThus to the Maithil lady sued  \nThe monarch of the giant brood,  \nAnd 'She is now mine own,' he thought,  \nIn Death's dire coils already caught.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LVI.: Sita's Disdain.](ry254.htm)\n\n"
