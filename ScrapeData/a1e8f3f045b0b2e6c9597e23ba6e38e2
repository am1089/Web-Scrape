 \nHow weak the sun, how cold the breeze!  \nHow white the rime on grass and trees!  \nThe leaves are sere, the woods have lost  \nTheir blossoms killed by nipping frost.  \nNeath open skies we sleep no more:  \nDecember's nights with rime are hoar:  \nTheir triple watch  3 in length extends  \nWith hours the shortened daylight lends.  \nNo more the moon's sun-borrowed rays  \nAre bright, involved in misty haze,  \nAs when upon the mirror's sheen  \nThe breath's obscuring cloud is seen.  \nE'en at the full the faint beams fail  \nTo struggle through the darksome veil:  \nChanged like her hue, they want the grace  \nThat parts not yet from Sita's face.  \nCold is the western wind, but how  \nIts piercing chill is heightened now,  \nBlowing at early morning twice  \nAs furious with its breath of ice!  \nSee how the dewy tears they weep  \nThe barley, wheat, and woodland steep,  \nWhere, as the sun goes up the sky.  \nThe curlew and the saras cry.  \nSee where the rice plants scarce uphold  \nTheir full ears tinged with paly gold,  \nBending their ripe heads slowly down  \nFair as the date tree's flowery crown.  \nThough now the sun has mounted high  \nSeeking the forehead of the sky,  \nSuch mist obscures his struggling beams,  \nNo bigger than the moon he seems.  \nThough weak at first, his rays at length  \nGrow pleasant in their noonday strength,  \nAnd where a while they chance to fall  \nFling a faint splendour over all.  \n\np. 249  \n\nSee, o'er the woods where grass is wet  \nWith hoary drops that cling there yet,  \nWith soft light clothing earth and bough  \nThere steals a tender glory now.  \nYon elephant who longs to drink,  \nStill standing on the river's brink,  \nPlucks back his trunk in shivering haste  \nFrom the cold wave he fain would taste.  \nThe very fowl that haunt the mere  \nStand doubtful on the bank, and fear  \nTo dip them in the wintry wave  \nAs cowards dread to meet the brave.  \nThe frost of night, the rime of dawn  \nBind flowerless trees and glades of lawn:  \nBenumbed in apathetic chill  \nOf icy chains they slumber still.  \nYou hear the hidden saras cry  \nFrom floods that wrapped in vapour lie,  \nAnd frosty-shining sands reveal  \nWhere the unnoticed rivers steal.  \nThe hoary rime of dewy night,  \nAnd suns that glow with tempered light  \nLend fresh cool flavours to the rill  \nThat sparkles from the tompost hill.  \nThe cold has killed the lily's pride:  \nLeaf, filament, and flower have died:  \nWith chilling breath rude winds have blown,  \nThe withered stalk is left alone.  \nAt this gay time, O noblest chief,  \nThe faithful Bharat, worn by grief,  \nLives in the royal town where he  \nSpends weary hours for love of thee.  \nFrom titles, honour, kingly sway,  \nFrom every joy he turns away:  \nCouched on cold earth, his days are passed  \nWith scanty fare and hermit's fast.  \nThis moment from his humble bed  \nHe lifts, perhaps, his weary head,  \nAnd girt by many a follower goes  \nTo bathe where silver Sarju flows.  \nHow, when the frosty morn is dim,  \nShall Sarju be a bath for him  \nNursed with all love and tender care,  \nSo delicate and young and fair.  \nHow bright his hue! his brilliant eye  \nWith the broad lotus leaf may vie.  \nBy fortune stamped for happy fate,  \nHis graceful form is tall aud straight.  \nIn duty skilled, his words are truth:  \nHe proudly rules each lust of youth.  \nThough his strong arm smites down the foe,  \nIn gentle speech his accents flow.  \nYet every joy has he resigned  \nAnd cleaves to thee with heart and mind.  \nThus by the deeds that he has done  \nA name in heaven has Bharat won,  \nFor in his life he follows yet  \nThy steps, O banished anchoret.  \nThus faithful Bharat, nobly wise,  \nThe proverb of the world belies:  \n'No men, by mothers' guidance led,  \nThe footsteps of their fathers tread.'  \nHow could Kaikeyi, blest to be  \nSpouse of the king our sire, and see  \nA son like virtuous Bharat, blot  \nHer glory with so foul a plot!'  \n   Thus in fraternal love he spoke,  \nAnd from his lips reproaches broke:  \nBut Rama grieved to hear him chide  \nThe absent mother, and replied:  \n   'Cease, O beloved, cease to blame  \nOur royal father's second dame.  \nStill speak of Bharat first in place  \nOf old Ikshvaku's princely race.  \nMy heart, so firmly bent but now  \nTo dwell in woods and keep my vow,  \nHalf melting as I hear thee speak  \nOf Bharat's love, grows soft and weak,  \nWith tender joy I bring to mind  \nHis speeches ever sweet and kind.  \nThat dear as Amrit took the sense  \nWith most enchanting influence.  \nAh, when shall I, no more to part,  \nMeet Bharat of the mighty heart?  \nWhen, O my brother, when shall we  \nThe good and brave S'atrughna see?'  \nThus as he poured his fond lament  \nThe son of Raghu onward went:  \nThey reached the river, and the three  \nBathed them in fair Godavari.  \nLibations of the stream they paid  \nTo every deity and shade,  \nWith hymns of praise, the Sun on high  \nAnd sinless Gods to glorify.  \nFresh from the purifying tide  \n   Resplendent Rama came,  \nWith Lakshman ever by his side,  \n   And the sweet Maithil dame.  \nSo Rudra shines by worlds adored,  \n   In glory undefiled,  \nWhen Nandi  [1](ry215.htm#fn_455) stands beside his lord,  \nAnd King Himalaya's child.
