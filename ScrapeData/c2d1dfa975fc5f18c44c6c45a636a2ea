Coming thus by\nsteps, it became known to royal sages. But, O terror of (your) foes! that\ndevotion was lost to the world by long (lapse of) time. That same primeval\ndevotion I have declared to you to-day, seeing. that you are my devotee and\nfriend, for it is the highest mystery.\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nLater is your birth the birth of the sun is prior. How then shall I understand\nthat you declared (this) first?\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nI have passed through many births, O Ar _g_ una I and you also. I know them\nall, but you, O terror of (your) foes! do not know them. Even though I am\nunborn and inexhaustible in (my) essence, even though I am lord of all beings,\nstill I take up the control of my own nature 3, and am born by means\n\np. 59\n\nof my delusive power. Whensoever, O descendant of Bharata! piety languishes,\nand impiety is in the ascendant, I create myself. I am born age after age, for\nthe protection of the good, for the destruction of evil-doers, and the\nestablishment of piety. Whoever truly knows thus my divine birth and work,\ncasts off (this) body and is not born again. He comes to me, O Ar _g_ una!\nMany from whom affection, fear 1, and wrath have departed, who are full of me,\nwho depend on me, and who are purified by the penance of knowledge 2, have\ncome into my essence. I serve men in the way in which they approach me 3. In\nevery way, O son of P _ri_ tha! men follow in my path 4. Desiring the success\nof actions 5, men in this world worship the divinities, for in this world of\nmortals, the success produced by action is soon obtained. The fourfold\ndivision of castes was created by me according to the apportionment of\nqualities and duties. But though I am its author, know me to be inexhaustible,\nand not the author. Actions defile me not. I have no attachment to the fruit\nof actions. He who knows me thus is not tied down by actions. Knowing this,\nthe men of old who wished for final emancipation, performed action. Therefore\ndo you, too, perform action as was done by men of old in olden times. Even\nsages are confused as to what\n\np. 60\n\nis action, what inaction. Therefore I will speak to you about action, and\nlearning that, you will be freed from (this world of) evil. One must possess\nknowledge about action; one must also possess knowledge about prohibited\naction; and again one must possess knowledge about inaction. The truth\nregarding action is abstruse. He is wise among men, he is possessed of\ndevotion, and performs all actions 1, who sees inaction in action, and action\nin inaction. The wise call him learned, whose acts are all free from desires\nand fancies, and whose actions are burnt down by the fire of knowledge.\nForsaking all attachment to the fruit of action, always contented, dependent\non none, he does nothing at all, though he engages in action. Devoid of\nexpectations, restraining the mind and the self, and casting off all\nbelongings 2, he incurs no sin, performing actions merely for the sake of the\nbody 3. Satisfied with earnings coming spontaneously 4, rising above the pairs\nof opposites, free from all animosity, and equable on success or ill-success,\nhe is not fettered down, even though he performs (actions). The acts of one\nwho is devoid of attachment, who is free 5, whose mind is fixed on knowledge,\nand who performs action for (the purpose of) the sacrifice 6 are all\ndestroyed.\n\np. 61\n\nBrahman is the oblation; with Brahman (as a sacrificial instrument) it is\noffered up; Brahman is in the fire; and by Brahman it is thrown; and Brahman,\ntoo, is the goal to which he proceeds who meditates on Brahman in the action\n1. Some devotees perform the sacrifice to the gods, some offer up the\nsacrifice by the sacrifice itself in the fire of Brahman 2. Others offer up\nthe senses, such as the sense of hearing and others, in the fires of restraint\n3; others offer up the objects of sense, such as sound and so forth, into the\nfires of the senses 4. Some again offer up all the operations of the senses\nand the operations of the life-breaths into the fire of devotion by self-\nrestraint 5, kindled by knowledge. Others perform the sacrifice of wealth, the\nsacrifice of penance, the sacrifice of concentration of mind, the sacrifice of\nVedic study 6, and of knowledge, and others are ascetics of rigid vows. Some\noffer up the upward life-breath into the downward life-breath, and the\ndownward life-breath into the upper life-breath, and stopping up the motions\nof the upward and downward life-breaths, devote themselves to the restraint of\nthe life-breaths 7. Others, who (take) limited food, offer up the life-breaths\ninto\n\np. 62\n\nthe life-breaths. All of these, conversant with the sacrifice, have their sins\ndestroyed by the sacrifice. Those who eat the nectar-like leavings of the\nsacrifice repair to the eternal Brahman 1. This world is not for those who\nperform no sacrifice, whence (then) the other, O best of the Kauravas! Thus\nsacrifices of various sorts are laid down in the Vedas. Know them all to be\nproduced from action 2, and knowing this you will be released (from the\nfetters of this world). The sacrifice of knowledge, O terror of (your) foes!\nis superior to the sacrifice of wealth, for action, O son of P _ri_ tha! is\nwholly and entirely comprehended in knowledge. That 3 you should learn by\nsalutation, question, and service 4. The men of knowledge who perceive the\ntruth will teach knowledge to you. Having learnt that, O son of Pa _nd_ u! you\nwill not again fall thus into delusion; and by means of it, you will see all\nbeings, without exception, first in yourself, and then in me 5. Even if you\nare the most sinful of all sinful men, you will cross over all trespasses by\nmeans of the boat of knowledge alone. As a fire well kindled, O Ar _g_ una!\nreduces fuel to ashes, so the fire of knowledge reduces all actions to ashes\n6. For there is in this world no means of sanctification like knowledge 7, and\nthat one perfected by devotion finds within one's self in time. He who has\nfaith, whose\n\np. 63\n\nsenses are restrained, and who is assiduous, obtains knowledge\n[1](sbe0807.htm#fn_212). Obtaining knowledge, he acquires, without delay, the\nhighest tranquillity. He who is ignorant and devoid of faith, and whose self\nis full of misgivings, is ruined. Not this world, not the next, nor happiness,\nis for him whose self is full of misgivings. Actions, O Dhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya! do not\nfetter one who is self-possessed [2](sbe0807.htm#fn_213), who has renounced\naction by devotion, and who has destroyed misgivings by knowledge. Therefore,\nO descendant of Bharata! destroy, with the sword of knowledge, these\nmisgivings of yours which fill your mind, and which are produced from\nignorance. Engage in devotion. Arise!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:1](sbe0806.htm#fr_185) Because its fruit is imperishable, viz. final\nemancipation.\n\n[58:2](sbe0806.htm#fr_186) In the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad, Manu is the channel\nof communication for some doctrine taught by Pra _g_ apati, which Manu teaches\nthe 'people,' interpreted by _S_ a _n_ kara to mean Ikshvaku, &c. (p. 178; see\ntoo p. 625).\n\n[58:3](sbe0806.htm#fr_187) Nature is what goes to the formation of the\nmaterial form in which he is born; the 'power' includes knowledge,\nomnipotence, &c. It is delusive because he is still really 'unborn.'\n\n[59:1](sbe0806.htm#fr_188) Cf. Sutta Nipata, p. 73.\n\n[59:2](sbe0806.htm#fr_189) Cf. infra, p. 61.\n\n[59:3](sbe0806.htm#fr_190) I. e. I give to each worshipper what is proper for\nhim.\n\n[59:4](sbe0806.htm#fr_191) The original words used here occur before in a\ndifferent sense (see [p. 55](sbe0805.htm#page_55)). Here the meaning is that\nto whomsoever directly addressed, all worship is worship of me (see [p.\n84](sbe0811.htm#page_84)). In the whole passage, K _ri_ sh _n_ a says that the\nDeity is not chargeable with partiality on account of the variety of human\nqualities and states.\n\n[59:5](sbe0806.htm#fr_192) Such as acquisition of sons, cattle, &c.\n\n[60:1](sbe0806.htm#fr_193) Devoted though performing all actions.\n\n[60:2](sbe0806.htm#fr_194) 'Appropriating nothing,' at Sutta Nipata, p. 101,\nseems to be the same idea. 'Self' just before this means senses.\n\n[60:3](sbe0806.htm#fr_195) Preferably, perhaps, 'with the body only.' But _S_\na _n_ kara rejects this.\n\n[60:4](sbe0806.htm#fr_196) Cf. infra, [p. 101](sbe0814.htm#page_101); and\nSutta Nipata, p. 12.\n\n[60:5](sbe0806.htm#fr_197) The commentators vary in their interpretations of\nthis word (mukta), but the common point appears to be 'free from attachment to\nworldly concerns,' Cf. Sutta Nipata, p. 8.\n\n[60:6](sbe0806.htm#fr_198) Sacrifice here apparently means every act for the\nattainment of p. 61 the supreme; cf. supra, [p. 53](sbe0805.htm#page_53). In \xc3\x82\n_s_ valayana G _ri_ hya-sutra III, 1, 5, a text is cited meaning 'salutation\nverily is a sacrifice.'\n\n[61:1](sbe0806.htm#fr_199) This thorough identification with the Brahman\nexplains why the action is 'destroyed' and does not 'fetter' the doer.\n\n[61:2](sbe0806.htm#fr_200) I. e. all acts, religious and other, offered up to\nthe Brahman in the mode above stated.\n\n[61:3](sbe0806.htm#fr_201) Practise 'yoga' and other like exercises.\n\n[61:4](sbe0806.htm#fr_202) Remaining unattached to sensuous enjoyments.\n\n[61:5](sbe0806.htm#fr_203) Stopping the bodily operations mentioned, and\nengaging in contemplation.\n\n[61:6](sbe0806.htm#fr_204) This is called Brahmaya _g_ \xc3\xb1a, \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana\nGrihya-sutra III, 1, 3.\n\n[61:7](sbe0806.htm#fr_205) Maitri-upanishad, p. 129.\n\n[62:1](sbe0806.htm#fr_206) Supra, [p. 53](sbe0805.htm#page_53).\n\n[62:2](sbe0806.htm#fr_207) Operations of mind, senses, &c.; cf. supra, [p.\n54](sbe0805.htm#page_54).\n\n[62:3](sbe0806.htm#fr_208) I. e. knowledge.\n\n[62:4](sbe0806.htm#fr_209) Addressed to men of knowledge.
