He who knows the oldest and the best becomes himself the oldest and the\nbest. Breath indeed is the oldest and the best.\n\n2\\. He who knows the richest, becomes himself the richest. Speech indeed is\nthe richest.\n\n3\\. He who knows the firm rest, becomes himself firm in this world and in the\nnext. The eye indeed is the firm rest.\n\n4\\. He who knows success, his wishes succeed, both his divine and human\nwishes. The ear indeed is success.\n\n5\\. He who knows the home, becomes a home of his people. The mind indeed is\nthe home.\n\n6\\. The five senses quarrelled together 2, who was the best, saying, I am\nbetter, I am better.\n\np. 73\n\n7\\. They went to their father Pra _g_ apati and said: 'Sir, who is the best of\nus?' He replied: 'He by whose departure the body seems worse than worst, he is\nthe best of you.'\n\n8\\. The tongue (speech) departed, and having been absent for a year, it came\nround and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied:\n'Like mute people, not speaking, but breathing with the breath, seeing with\nthe eye, hearing with the ear, thinking with the mind. Thus we lived.' Then\nspeech went back.\n\n9\\. The eye (sight) departed, and having been absent for a year, it came round\nand said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied: 'Like\nblind people, not seeing, but breathing with the breath, speaking with the\ntongue, hearing with the ear, thinking with the mind. Thus we lived.' Then the\neye went back.\n\n10\\. The ear (hearing) departed, and having been absent for a year, it came\nround and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied:\n'Like deaf people, not hearing, but breathing with the breath, speaking with\nthe tongue, thinking with the mind. Thus we lived.' Then the ear went back.\n\n11\\. The mind departed, and having been absent for a year, it came round and\nsaid: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied: 'Like\nchildren whose mind is not yet formed, but breathing with the breath, speaking\nwith the tongue, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear. Thus we lived.'\nThen the mind went back.\n\n12\\. The breath, when on the point of departing, tore up the other senses, as\na horse, going to start,\n\np. 74\n\nmight tear up the pegs to which he is tethered [1](sbe01096.htm#fn_228). They\ncame to him and said: 'Sir, be thou (our lord); thou art the best among us. Do\nnot depart from us!'\n\n13\\. Then the tongue said to him: 'If I am the richest, thou art the richest.'\nThe eye said to him: 'If I am the firm rest, thou art the firm rest\n[2](sbe01096.htm#fn_229).'\n\n14\\. The ear said to him: 'If I am success, thou art success.' The mind said\nto him: 'If I am the home, thou art the home.'\n\n15\\. And people do not call them, the tongues, the eyes, the ears, the minds,\nbut the breaths (pra _n_ a, the senses). For breath are all these.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[72:1](sbe01095.htm#fr_227) The chief object is to show the different ways on\nwhich people proceed after death. One of these ways, the Devapatha that leads\nto Brahman and from which there is no return, has been described, IV, 15. The\nother ways for those who on earth know the conditioned Brahman only, have to\nbe discussed now.\n\n[72:2](sbe01095.htm#fr_228) The same fable, the pra _n_ asa _m_ vada or pra\n_n_ avidya, is told in the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka VI, 1, 1-14, the Aitareya\n\xc3\x82r. II, 4, the Kaush. Up. III, 3, and the Pra _s_ na Up. II, 3. The last is\nthe simplest version of all, but it does not follow therefore that it is the\noldest. It would be difficult to find two fables apparently more alike, yet in\nreality differing from each other more characteristically than this fable and\nthe fable told to the plebeians by Menenius Agrippa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 2](sbe01096.htm)\n\n"
