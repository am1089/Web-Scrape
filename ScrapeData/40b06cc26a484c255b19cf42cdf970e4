The ceremony of Samaroha _n_ a, by which\nthe duties towards the sacred fire are suspended, by causing the fire to\n\'enter\' into the sacrificer\'s body, or into the two Ara _n_ is, or into\nanother piece of wood, is already mentioned in several passages of the Brahma\n_n_ a texts; comp. the quotations given by Professor Weber, Indische Studien,\nIX, 3r 1. Comp. besides \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana- _S_ rauta-sutra III 10; Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-\n_S_ raut. II, 17. The Samaroha _n_ a into the sacrificer\'s own body is done by\nwarming the hands at the sacred fire; see \xc3\x82 _s_ v., loc. cit., Sutra 6. In the\nSa\xe1\xb9\x85khayana- _S_ rauta-sutra the corresponding rule, which regards there of\ncourse the \xc3\x82hitagni, runs thus, \'If he performs the Samaroha _n_ a, he warms\nhis hands at the Garhapatya fire, and then touches his Pra _n_ as with the\nwords, "Come, enter into my Pra _n_ as."\' On the two other cases, see the\nSutras 3 and 4. Sutras 2, 3, 5 are taken word for word from the _S_ rauta-\nsutra.\n\n[133:2](sbe29082.htm#fr_298) This Sutra refers only to the case where he\ncauses the fire to enter into himself.\n\n[133:5](sbe29082.htm#fr_299) Comp. the commentary on \xc3\x82 _s_ v.- _S_ raut., loc.\ncit. 8. He makes the fire redescend from his body or from the Ara _n_ is by\nperforming the Manthana (kindling the fire by attrition of the Ara _n_ is).\n\n[133:7](sbe29082.htm#fr_300) The Mantra alluded to here is given in the _S_\nrauta-sutra. It p. 134 runs thus, \'Redescend, O _G_ atavedas; carry again\nofferings to the gods, knowing us. Long life, offspring, wealth bestow on us;\nuninjured shine in our dwelling!\'\n\n[134:8-9](sbe29082.htm#fr_301) These Sutras stand in no connection with the\nSamaroha _n_ a treated of before.\n\nOn the two Sarvapraya _s_ _k_ itta oblations see above, I, 9, 12 and the note\nthere.\n\nThe vow spoken of in Sutra 9 Naraya _n_ a refers to the restrictions regarding\nthe food which the sacrificer and his wife are to eat on the Upavasatha days,\nconnected with the festivals of the full and new moon.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 2](sbe29083.htm)\n\n'
