But with a view to the efforts made (the Lord makes the soul act) on\naccount of the (thus resulting) non-meaninglessness of injunctions and\nprohibitions and the rest.\n\nThe inwardly ruling highest Self promotes action in so far as it regards in\nthe case of any action the volitional effort made by the individual soul, and\nthen aids that effort by granting its favour or permission (anumati); action\nis not possible without permission on the part of the highest Self. In this\nway (i.e. since the action primarily depends on the volitional effort of the\nsoul) injunctions and prohibitions are not devoid of meaning. The 'and the\nrest' of the Sutra is meant to suggest the grace and punishments awarded by\nthe Lord.--The case is analogous to that of property of which two men are\njoint owners. If one of these wishes to transfer that property to a third\nperson he cannot do so without the permission of his partner, but that that\npermission is given is after all his own doing, and hence the fruit of the\naction (reward or anything) properly belongs to him only.--That, in the case\nof evil\n\np. 558\n\nactions, allowance of the action on the part of one able to stop it does not\nnecessarily prove hardheartedness, we have shown above when explaining the Sa\n_n_ khya doctrine.--But there is a scriptural text.--'He (the Lord) makes him\nwhom he wishes to lead up from these worlds do a good deed, and the same makes\nhim whom he wishes to lead down from these worlds do a bad deed' (Kau. Up.\nIII, 8)--which means that the Lord himself causes men to do good and evil\nactions, and this does not agree with the partial independence claimed above\nfor the soul.--The text quoted, we reply, does not apply to all agents, but\nmeans that the Lord, wishing to do a favour to those who are resolved on\nacting so as fully to please the highest Person, engenders in their minds a\ntendency towards highly virtuous actions, such as are means to attain to him;\nwhile on the other hand, in order to punish those who are resolved on lines of\naction altogether displeasing to him, he engenders in their minds a delight in\nsuch actions as have a downward tendency and are obstacles in the way of the\nattainment of the Lord. Thus the Lord himself says, 'I am the origin of all,\neverything proceeds from me; knowing this the wise worship me with love. To\nthem ever devoted, worshipping me in love, I give that means of wisdom by\nwhich they attain to me. In mercy only to them, dwelling in their hearts, do I\ndestroy the darkness born of ignorance, with the brilliant light of knowledge'\n(Bha. Gi. X, 8; 10-11). And further on the Lord--after having described\n'demoniac' people, in the passus beginning 'they declare the world to be\nwithout a Truth, without a resting-place, without a Ruler,' and ending\n'malignantly hating me who abides in their own bodies and those of others'--\ndeclares, 'These evil and malign haters, most degraded of men, I hurl\nperpetually into transmigrations and into demoniac wombs' (XVI, 8-19).\n\nHere terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'that which depends on the Highest.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 42.
