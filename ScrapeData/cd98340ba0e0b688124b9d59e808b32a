O golden rings,  \nThat tap against cheeks of small magnolia leaves,  \nO whitest so soft parchment where  \nMy poor divorced lips have written excellent  \nStanzas of kisses, and will write no more.\n\nEven now  \nDeath sends me the flickering of powdery lids  \nOver wild eyes and the pity of her slim body  \nAll broken up with the weariness of joy;  \nThe little red flowers of her breasts to be my comfort  \nMoving above scarves, and for my sorrow  \nWet crimson lips that once I marked as mine.\n\nEven now  \nBy a cool noise of waters in the spring  \nThe asoka with young flowers that feign her fingers  \nAnd bud in red; and in the green vest pearls kissing  \nAs it were rose leaves in the gardens of God; the shining at night  \nOf white cheeks in the dark; smiles from light thoughts within,  \nAnd her walking as of a swan; these trouble me.\n\nEven now  \nThe pleased intimacy of rough love  \nUpon the patient glory of her form  \nRacks me with memory; and her bright dress  \nAs it were yellow flame, which the white hand  \nShamefastly gathers in her rising haste,  \nThe slender grace of her departing feet.\n\nEven now  \nWhen all my heavy heart is broken up  \nI seem to see my prison walls breaking  \nAnd then a light, and in that light a girl  \nHer fingers busied about her hair, her cool white arms  \nFaint rosy at the elbows, raised in the sunlight,  \nAnd temperate eyes that wander far away.\n\nEven now  \nI seem to see my prison walls come close,  \nBuilt up of darkness, and against that darkness  \nA girl no taller than my breast and very tired,  \nLeaning upon the bed and smiling, feeding  \nA little bird and lying slender as ash-trees,  \nSleepily aware as I told of the green  \nGrapes and the small bright-coloured river flowers.\n\nEven now  \nI see her, as I used, in her white palace  \nUnder black torches throwing cool red light,  \nWoven with many flowers and tearing the dark.  \nI see her rising, showing all her face  \nDefiant timidly, saying clearly;  \nNow I shall go to sleep, good-night, my ladies.\n\nEven now  \nThough I am so far separate, a flight of birds  \nSwinging from side to side over the valley trees,  \nPassing my prison with their calling and crying,  \nBring me to see my girl. For very bird-like  \nIs her song singing, and the state of a swan  \nIn her light walking, like the shaken wings  \nOf a black eagle falls her nightly hair.\n\nEven now  \nI know my princess was happy. I see her stand  \nTouching her breasts with all her flower-soft fingers,  \nLooking askance at me with smiling eyes.  \nThere is a god that arms him with a flower  \nAnd she was stricken deep. Her, oh die here.  \nKiss me and I shall be purer than quick rivers.\n\nEven now  \nThey chatter her weakness through the two bazaars  \nWho was so strong to love me. And small men  \nThat buy and sell for silver being slaves  \nCrinkle the fat about their eyes; and yet  \nNo Prince of the Cities of the Sea has taken her,  \nLeading to his grim bed. Little lonely one,  \nYou clung to me as a garment clings, my girl.\n\nEven now  \nOnly one dawn shall rise for me. The stars  \nRevolve to-morrow's night and I not heed.  \nOne brief cold watch beside an empty heart  \nAnd that is all. This night she rests not well;  \nOh, sleep; for there is heaviness for all the world  \nExcept for the death-lighted heart of me.\n\nEven now  \nMy sole concern the slipping of her vests,  \nHer little breasts the life beyond this life.  \nOne night of disarray in her green hems,  \nHer golden cloths, outweighs the order of the earth,  \nMaking of none effect the tides of the sea.  \nI have seen her enter the temple meekly and there seem  \nThe flag of flowers that veils the very god.\n\nEven now  \nI mind the coming and talking of wise men from towers  \nWhere they had thought away their youth. And I, listening,  \nFound not the salt of the whispers of my girl,  \nMurmur of confused colours, as we lay near sleep;  \nLittle wise words and little witty words  \nWanton as water, honeyed with eagerness.\n\nEven now  \nI call to mind her weariness in the morning  \nClose lying in my arms, and tiredly smiling  \nAt my disjointed prayer for her small sake.  \nNow in my morning the weariness of death  \nSends me to sleep. Had I made coffins  \nI might have lived singing to three score.\n\nEven now  \nThe woodcutter and fisherman turn home,  \nWith on his axe the moon and in his dripping net  \nCaught yellow moonlight. The purple flame of fire  \nCalls them to love and sleep. From the hot town  \nThe maker of scant songs for bread wanders  \nTo lie under the clematis with his girl.  \nThe moon shines on her breasts, and I must die.\n\nEven now  \nI have a need to make up prayers, to speak  \nMy last consideration of the world  \nTo the great thirteen gods, to make my balance  \nEre the soul journeys on. I kneel and say:  \nFather of Light. Leave we it burning still  \nThat I may look at you. Mother of the Stars,  \nGive me your feet to kiss; I love you, dear.\n\nEven now  \nI seem to see the face of my lost girl  \nWith frightened eyes, like a wood wanderer,  \nIn travail with sorrowful waters, unwept tears  \nLabouring to be born and fall; when white face turned  \nAnd little ears caught at the far murmur,  \nThe pleased snarling of the tumult of dogs  \nWhen I was buried away down the white road.\n\nEven now  \nWhen slow rose-yellow moons looked out at night  \nTo guard the sheaves of harvest and mark down  \nThe peach's fall, how calm she was and love worthy.  \nGlass-coloured starlight falling as thin as dew  \nWas wont to find us at the spirit's starving time  \nSlow straying in the orchard paths with love.\n\nEven now  \nLove is a god and Rati the dark his bride;  \nBut once I found their child and she was fairer,  \nThat could so shine. And we were each to each  \nWonderful and a presence not yet felt  \nIn any dream. I knew the sunset earth  \nBut as a red gold ring to bear my emerald  \nWithin the little summer of my youth.\n\nEven now  \nI marvel at the bravery of love,  \nShe, whose two feet might be held in one hand  \nAnd all her body on a shield of the guards,  \nLashed like a gold panther taken in a pit  \nTearfully valiant, when I too was taken'  \nBearding her black-beard father in his wrath,  \nStriking the soldiers with white impotent hands.\n\nEven now  \nI mind that I loved cypress and roses, dear,  \nThe great blue mountains and the small grey hills,  \nThe sounding of the sea. Upon a day  \nI saw strange eyes and hands like butterflies;  \nFor me at morning larks flew from the thyme  \nAnd children came to bathe in little streams.\n\nEven now  \nSleep left me all these nights for your white bed  \nAnd I am sure you sistered lay with sleep  \nAfter much weeping. Piteous little love,  \nDeath is in the garden, time runs down,  \nThe year that simple and unexalted ran till now  \nFerments in winy autumn, and I must die.\n\nEven now  \nI mind our going, full of bewilderment  \nAs who should walk from sleep into great light,  \nAlong the running of the winter river,  \nA dying sun on the cool hurrying tide  \nNo more by green rushes delayed in dalliance,  \nWith a clear purpose in his flower-flecked length  \nInformed, to reach Nirvana and the sea.\n\nEven now  \nI love long black eyes that caress like silk,  \nEver and ever sad and laughing eyes,  \nWhose lids make such sweet shadow when they close  \nIt seems another beautiful look of hers.  \nI love a fresh mouth, ah, a scented mouth,  \nAnd curving hair, subtle as a smoke,  \nAnd light fingers, and laughter of green gems.\n\nEven now  \nI mind asking: Where love and how love Rati's priestesses?  \nYou can tell me of their washings at moon-down  \nAnd if that warm basin have silver borders.  \nIs it so that when they comb their hair  \nTheir fingers, being purple-stained, show  \nLike coral branches in the black sea of their hair?\n\nEven now  \nI remember that you made answer very softly,  \nWe being one soul, your hand on my hair,  \nThe burning memory rounding your near lips;  \nI have seen the priestesses of Rati make love at moon-fall  \nAnd then in a carpeted hall with a bright gold lamp  \nLie down carelessly anywhere to sleep.\n\nEven now  \nI have no surety that she is not Mahadevi  \nRose red of Siva, or Kapagata  \nThe wilful ripe Companion of the King,  \nOr Krishna's own Lakshmi, the violet-haired.  \nI am not certain but that dark Brahma  \nIn his high secret purposes  \nHas sent my soft girl down to make the three worlds mad  \nWith capering about her scented feet.\n\nEven now  \nCall not the master painters from all the world,  \nTheir thin black boards, their rose and green and grey,  \nTheir ashes of lapis ultramarine, Their earth of shadows the umber. Laughing\nat art  \nSunlight upon the body of my bride,  \nFor painting not nor any eyes for ever.  \nOh warm tears on the body of my bride.\n\nEven now  \nI mind when the red crowds were passed and it was raining  \nHow glad those two that shared the rain with me;  \nFor they talked happily with rich young voices  \nAnd at the storm's increase, closer and with content,  \nEach to the body of the other held  \nAs there were no more severance for ever.\n\nEven now  \nThe stainless fair appearance of the moon  \nRolls her gold beauty over an autumn sky  \nAnd the stiff anchorite forgets to pray;  \nHow much the sooner I, if her wild mouth  \nTasting of the taste of manna came to mine  \nAnd kept my soul at balance above a kiss.\n\nEven now  \nHer mouth careless scented as with lotus dust  \nIs water of love to the great heat of love,  \nA tirtha very holy, a lover's lake  \nUtterly sacred. Might I go down to it  \nBut one more time, then should I find a way  \nTo hold my lake for ever and ever more  \nSobbing out my life beside the waters.\n\nEven now  \nI mind that the time of the falling of blossoms started my dream  \nInto a wild life, into my girl;  \nThen was the essence of her beauty spilled  \nDown on my days so that it fades not,  \nFails not, subtle and fresh, in perfuming  \nThat day, and the days, and this the latest day.\n\nEven now  \nShe with young limbs as smooth as flower pollen,  \nWhose swaying body is laved in the cool  \nWaters of languor, this dear bright-coloured bird,  \nWalks not, changes not, advances not  \nHer weary station by the black lake  \nOf Gone Forever, in whose fountain vase  \nBalance the water-lilies of my thought.\n\nEven now  \nSpread we our nets beyond the farthest rims  \nSo surely that they take the feet of dawn  \nBefore you wake and after you are sleeping  \nCatch up the visible and invisible stars  \nAnd web the ports the strongest dreamer dreamed,  \nYet is it all one, Vidya, yet it is nothing.\n\nEven now  \nThe night is full of silver straws of rain,  \nAnd I will send my soul to see your body  \nThis last poor time. I stand beside our bed;  \nYour shadowed head lies leaving a bright space  \nUpon the pillow empty, your sorrowful arm  \nHolds from your side and clasps not anything.  \nThere is no covering upon you.\n\nEven now  \nI think your feet seek mine to comfort them.  \nThere is some dream about you even now  \nWhich I'll not hear at waking. Weep not at dawn,  \nThough day brings wearily your daily loss  \nAnd all the light is hateful. Now is it time  \nTo bring my soul away.\n\nEven now  \nI mind that I went round with men and women,  \nAnd underneath their brows, deep in their eyes,  \nI saw their souls, which go slippng aside  \nIn swarms before the pleasure of my mind;  \nThe world was like a flight of birds, shadow or flame  \nWhich I saw pass above the engraven hills.  \nYet was there never one like to my woman.\n\nEven now  \nDeath I take up as consolation.  \nNay, were I free as the condor with his wings  \nOr old kings throned on violet ivory,  \nNight would not come without beds of green floss  \nAnd never a bed without my bright darling.  \n Most fit that you strike now, black guards,  \nAnd let the fountain out before the dawn.\n\nEven now  \nI know that I have savoured the hot taste of life  \nLifting green cups and gold at the great feast.  \nJust for a small and a forgotten time  \nI have had full in my eyes from off my girl  \nThe whitest pouring of eternal light.  \nThe heavy knife. As to a gala day.\n\n\\--E. Powys Mathers  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n"
