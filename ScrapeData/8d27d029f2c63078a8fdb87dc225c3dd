"Oh dear," she exclaimed, "has it come to this that you must make\ncakes for your own birthday?"\n\n"Is there no one else for whom I could be making them?" I asked.\n\n"But this is not the day when you should think of feasting others. It is for\nus to feast you. I was just thinking of making something up  29 when I heard\nthe staggering news which completely upset me. A gang of five or six hundred\nmen, they say, has raided one of our treasuries and made off with six thousand\nrupees. Our house will be looted next, they expect."\n\nI felt greatly relieved. So it was our own money after all. I wanted to send\nfor Amulya at once and tell him that he need only hand over those notes to my\nhusband and leave the explanations to me.\n\n"You are a wonderful creature!" my sister-in-law broke out, at the change in\nmy countenance. "Have you then really no such thing as fear?"\n\n"I cannot believe it," I said. "Why should they loot our house?"\n\n"Not believe it, indeed! Who could have believed that they would attack our\ntreasury, either?"\n\nI made no reply, but bent over my cakes, putting in the cocoa-nut stuffing.\n\n"Well, I\'m off," said the Bara Rani after a prolonged stare at me. "I must see\nBrother Nikhil and get something done about sending off my money to Calcutta,\nbefore it\'s too late."\n\nShe was no sooner gone than I left the cakes to take care of themselves and\nrushed to my dressing-room, shutting myself inside. My husband\'s tunic with\nthe keys in its pocket was still hanging there--so forgetful was he. I took\nthe key of the iron safe off the ring and kept it by me, hidden in the folds\nof my dress.\n\nThen there came a knocking at the door. "I am dressing," I called out. I could\nhear the Bara Rani saying: "Only a minute ago I saw her making cakes and now\nshe is busy dressing up. What next, I wonder! One of their _Bande Mataram_\nmeetings is on, I suppose. I say, Robber Queen," she called out to me, "are\nyou taking stock of your loot?"\n\nWhen they went away I hardly know what made me open the safe. Perhaps there\nwas a lurking hope that it might all be a dream. What if, on pulling out the\ninside drawer, I should find the rolls of gold there, just as before? ...\nAlas, everything was empty as the trust which had been betrayed.\n\nI had to go through the farce of dressing. I had to do my hair up all over\nagain, quite unnecessarily. When I came out my sister-in-law railed at me:\n"How many times are you going to dress today?"\n\n"My birthday!" I said.\n\n"Oh, any pretext seems good enough," she went on. "Many vain people have I\nseen in my day, but you beat them all hollow."\n\nI was about to summon a servant to send after Amulya, when one of the men came\nup with a little note, which he handed to me. It was from Amulya. "Sister," he\nwrote, you invited me this afternoon, but I thought I should not wait. Let me\nfirst execute your bidding and then come for my _prasad_. I may be a little\nlate."\n\nTo whom could he be going to return that money? into what fresh entanglement\nwas the poor boy rushing? O miserable woman, you can only send him off like an\narrow, but not recall him if you miss your aim.\n\nI should have declared at once that I was at the bottom of this robbery. But\nwomen live on the trust of their surroundings--this is their whole world. If\nonce it is out that this trust has been secretly betrayed, their place in\ntheir world is lost. They have then to stand upon the fragments of the thing\nthey have broken, and its jagged edges keep on wounding them at every turn. To\nsin is easy enough, but to make up for it is above all difficult for a woman.\n\nFor some time past all easy approaches for communion with my husband have been\nclosed to me. How then could I burst on him with this stupendous news? He was\nvery late in coming for his meal today--nearly two o\'clock. He was absent-\nminded and hardly touched any food. I had lost even the right to press him to\ntake a little more. I had to avert my face to wipe away my tears.\n\nI wanted so badly to say to him: "Do come into our room and rest awhile; you\nlook so tired." I had just cleared my throat with a little cough, when a\nservant hurried in to say that the Police Inspector had brought Panchu up to\nthe palace. My husband, with the shadow on his face deepened, left his meal\nunfinished and went out.\n\nA little later the Bara Rani appeared. "Why did you not send me word when\nBrother Nikhil came in?" she complained. "As he was late I thought I might as\nwell finish my bath in the meantime. However did he manage to get through his\nmeal so soon?"\n\n"Why, did you want him for anything?"\n\n"What is this about both of you going off to Calcutta tomorrow? All I can say\nis, I am not going to be left here alone. I should get startled out of my life\nat every sound, with all these dacoits about. Is it quite settled about your\ngoing tomorrow?"\n\n"Yes," said I, though I had only just now heard it; and though, moreover, I\nwas not at all sure that before tomorrow our history might not take such a\nturn as to make it all one whether we went or stayed. After that, what our\nhome, our life would be like, was utterly beyond my ken--it seemed so misty\nand phantom-like.\n\nIn a very few hours now my unseen fate would become visible. Was there no one\nwho could keep on postponing the flight of these hours, from day to day, and\nso make them long enough for me to set things right, so far as lay in my\npower? The time during which the seed lies underground is long--so long indeed\nthat one forgets that there is any danger of its sprouting. But once its shoot\nshows up above the surface, it grows and grows so fast, there is no time to\ncover it up, neither with skirt, nor body, nor even life itself.\n\nI will try to think of it no more, but sit quiet--passive and callous--let the\ncrash come when it may. By the day after tomorrow all will be over--publicity,\nlaughter, bewailing, questions, explanations--everything.\n\nBut I cannot forget the face of Amulya--beautiful, radiant with devotion. He\ndid not wait, despairing, for the blow of fate to fall, but rushed into the\nthick of danger. In my misery I do him reverence. He is my boy-god. Under the\npretext of his playfulness he took from me the weight of my burden. He would\nsave me by taking the punishment meant for me on his own head. But how am I to\nbear this terrible mercy of my God?\n\nOh, my child, my child, I do you reverence. Little brother mine, I do you\nreverence. Pure are you, beautiful are you, I do you reverence. May you come\nto my arms, in the next birth, as my own child--that is my prayer.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[29](hw44.htm#fr_28) Any dainties to be offered ceremonially should be made by\nthe lady of the house herself.
