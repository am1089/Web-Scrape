M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81.--The word _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81,_ magic illusion, is commonly used in the later\nVed\xc4\x81nta to denote the phantom character of the phenomenal world; and in this\nsense it does not appear in the Upanishads until the \xc5\x9avet\xc4\x81\xc5\x9bvatara (IV. 10). It\nis not found in the Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra; and hence the question has often been raised\nwhether the idea denoted by it was actually present in the minds of the\nauthors of the older Upanishads.\n\nThat phenomena, even to the first principles under which they are cognised\n(space, time, and causality), are unreal relatively to Absolute Being, is a\ncardinal doctrine not only of the Upanishads but of all metaphysics. Even the\nVedic poets assert a real being of primal unity concealed behind the manifold\nof experience; and on this is founded the Upanishadic principle that the\nuniverse exists only in and by virtue of a World-Idea essentially identical\nwith the individual consciousness. This, however, is still far from the _m\n\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_-theory of the later Ved\xc4\x81nta. The authors of the older Upanishads were\nstill much influenced by the realism of the Vedas, and it is therefore\ndoubtful whether they could have agreed with the Vedantists who treat the\nworld of experience as _absolutely_ unreal, a mere phantom\n\np. 39\n\nconjured up by the Self for its own delusion. As typical of the Upanishadic\nattitude we may regard the theory of the Five \xc4\x80tm\xc4\x81s (\xc2\xa7 12) and the long\npassage of the B\xe1\xb9\x9bihad-\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87yaka (III. vii. 3 f.) where the Self is described in\ndetail as the _antary \xc4\x81m\xc4\xab,_ or "inward controller," functioning as soul within\nmatter as its body. Their view was in the main somewhat as follows. Phenomena\nare evolved from the Self, and hold their existence as _intelligibilia_ in fee\nfrom the Self; with the knowledge of the Self they become known as phases of\nit; hence they are, to this extent, and no further, really existent ( _satya,_\nB.A. I. vi. 3), provisionally true, although it is only ignorance of the Self\nthat regards them as really independent of the Self and manifold. The\nUpanishads on the whole conceive the empiric soul\'s ignorance as a negative\nforce, an absence of light; with \xc5\x9aankara and the later Ved\xc4\x81nta it is positive,\na false light, a constructive illusion. Brahma as cause of phenomena is in the\nUpanishads a _real_ material, in \xc5\x9aankara\'s school an _unreal_ material.\n\nThe difficulties besetting \xc5\x9aankara when he endeavours to bring logical order\ninto the vague idealism of the Upanishads are very serious. On the one hand he\nmaintains that the whole phenomenal world is unreal _(avastu)_. As a magician\n_(m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81v\xc4\xab)_ causes a phantom or wraith to issue from his person which has no\nreal existence and by which the magician himself is entirely unaffected,\n\np. 40\n\nso Brahma creates from himself a universe which is an utter phantom and nowise\nmodifies his absolute existence. His creative "powers" (which are real only\nwhen regarded from the standpoint of his creation, the world of finite\nsubjects and objects) constitute the demiurgic principle of an empiric\nuniverse, which is, from its own standpoint, coextensive with him, whereas\nabsolutely speaking it does not exist at all (see commentary on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra,\nII. i. 6, 9, etc., and above, \xc2\xa7 9). On the other hand, the universe, phantom\nas it is, nevertheless is a fact of consciousness. Illusion though it be, the\nillusion _is._ This predicate of existence is the bond uniting it with its\nsource, the truly existent, Brahma (on II. i. 6). Brahma is absolute thought,\nthe world is false thought; but the subject in both cases is the same, the\nthinking Self. Thus _M \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ denotes the sum of phenomena--or, as more narrowly\ndefined by some later Vedantists, the sum of matter--as illusively conceived\nby the Self; it is the Ignorance which creates the phantom of a universe and\nof an individual ego by imposing its figments upon pure Thought (\xc2\xa7 12).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Relation of Universal to Individual Soul](brk20.htm)\n\n'
