It has to be performed on the full-moon day (of the month _S_ rava _n_ a).\n\n3\\. Having besmeared (a surface) to the east of the house (with cow-dung),\nthey carry forward (to that place) fire taken from the (sacred) domestic fire.\n\n4\\. He besmears four spots to the four sides (of the fire),\n\n5\\. Towards the (four) directions,\n\n6\\. (To the extent) of more than one prakrama (i.e. step).\n\n7\\. He puts a dish on the fire and fries (in that\n\np. 90\n\ndish) one handful of barley-grains, without burning them.\n\n8. 8 To the west of the fire he places a mortar so that it stands firmly, and husks (the grains), separating (the husked and the unhusked grains?).\n\n9\\. After he has carefully ground them to flour, and has thrown (that) into a\nwooden cup ( _k_ amasa), and covered it with a winnowing-basket, he puts it up\n(in the house).\n\n10\\. Between (the besmeared surface) towards the south, and that towards the\neast (there should be) a passage.\n\n11. 11 After sunset he takes the wooden cup, (the spoon called) Darvi, and the winnowing-basket, and goes to (the fire) which has been carried forward (Sutra 3).\n\n12\\. He throws the flour into the winnowing-basket and fills the wooden cup\nwith water.\n\n13\\. He takes once a quantity of flour with the Darvi spoon, pours out water\non the besmeared place to the east (of the fire), and offers (there) a Bali\nwith (the words), \'O king of Serpents, dwelling towards the east, this is thy\nBali!\' (MB. II, 1, 1).\n\n14\\. He pours the rest of the water over (that Bali, taking care) that it does\nnot carry away the Bali.\n\np. 91\n\n15. 15 Turning round from right to left, he besprinkles the wooden cup and the Darvi spoon, warms them, and (repeats the offering of a Bali) in the same way towards the south, towards the west, and towards the north, as the Mantra (MB. II, I, 1. 2) runs, without turning away (between the single Bali-offerings).\n\n16. 16 After he has thrown the remnants (of flour) out of the basket into the fire, he goes to that fire which has not been carried forward.\n\n17. 17 To the west of that fire he touches the earth with his two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the Mantra, \'Adoration to the Earth\xc2\x92s\'\xc2\x97(MB. II, 1, 3).\n\n18\\. In the evening boiled rice-grains with milk (are prepared).\n\n19\\. Of that (milk-rice) he should make oblations with (the formulas), \'To _S_\nrava _n_ a, to Vish _n_ u, to Agni, to Pra _g_ apati, to the Vi _s_ ve devas\nSvaha!\'\n\n20. 20 The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthalipaka rite.\n\n21\\. To the north of the fire he places a bunch of Darbha grass with roots,\nand murmurs the Mantra, \'Soma the king\' (ibid. 4), and, \'The agreement which\nyou have made\' (ibid. 5).\n\np. 92\n\n22\\. On the following day he has flour of fried barley-grains prepared, and in\na new pot, covering (it with another pot), he puts it up (in his house).\n\n23. 23 (Of that flour) he should silently offer Balis day by day in the evening, before the sacrifice, until the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i day.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[89:1](sbe30029.htm#fr_317) 7, 1 seq.
