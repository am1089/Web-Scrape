Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# MAHABHARATA - CONCLUSION\n\nTHE real Epic ends with the war and with the funerals of the deceased\nwarriors, as we have stated before, and Yudhishthir\'s Horse-Sacrifice is\nrather a crowning ornament than a part of the solid edifice. What follows the\nsacrifice is in no sense a part of the real Epic; it consists merely of\nconcluding personal narratives of the heroes who have figured in the poem.\n\nDhrita-rashtra retires into a forest with his queen Gandhari, and Pritha, the\nmother of the Pandav brothers, accompanies them. In the solitude of the forest\nthe old Dhrita-rashtra sees as in a vision the spirits of all the slain\nwarriors, his sons and grandsons and kins men, clad and armed as they were in\nbattle. The spirits disappear in the morning at the bidding of Vyasa, who had\ncalled them up. At last Dhrita-rashtra and Gandhari and Pritha are burnt to\ndeath in a forest conflagration, death by fire being considered holy.\n\nKrishna at Dwarka meets with strange and tragic adventures. The Vrishnis and\nthe Andhakas become irreligious and addicted to drinking, and fall a prey to\ninternal dissensions. Valadeva and Krishna die shortly after, and the city of\nthe Yadavas is swallowed up by the ocean.\n\nThen follow the two concluding Books of the Epic, the _Great Journey_ and the\n_Ascent to Heaven_ , so beautifully rendered into English by Sir Edwin Arnold.\nOn hearing of the death of their friend Krishna, the Pandav brothers place\nPrakshit, the grandson of Arjun, on the throne, and retire to the Himalayas.\nDraupadi drops down dead on the way, then Sahadeva, then Nakula, then Arjun,\nand then Bhima. Yudhishthir alone proceeds to heaven in person in a celestial\ncar.\n\nThere Yudhishthir undergoes some trial, bathes in the celestial Ganges, and\nrises with a celestial body. He then meets Krishna, now in his heavenly form,\nblazing in splendour and glory. He meets his brothers whom he had lost on\nearth, but who are now Immortals in the sky, clad in heavenly forms. INDRA\nhimself appears before Yudhishthir, and introduces him to others who were dear\nto him on earth, and are dear to him in heaven. Thus speaks INDRA to\nYudhishthir:\n\n"This is She the fair Immortal! Her no human mother bore,  \nSprung from altar as Draupadi human shape for thee she wore,\n\nBy the Wielder of the Trident she was waked to form and life,  \nBorn in royal Drupad\'s mansion, righteous man, to be thy wife,\n\nThese are bright aerial beings, went for thee to lower earth,  \nBorne by Drupad\'s stainless daughter as thy children took their birth!\n\nThis is monarch Dhrita-rashtra who doth o\'er _Gandharvas_ reign,  \nThis is peerless archer Karna, erst on earth by Arjun slain,\n\nLike the Sun in ruddy splendour, for the Sun inspired his birth,  \nAs the son of chariot-driver he was known upon the earth!\n\nMidst the _Sadhyas_ and the _Maruts_ , \'midst Immortals pure and bright,  \nSeek thy friends the faithful Vrishnis matchless in their warlike might.\n\nSeek and find the brave Satyaki who upheld thy cause so well,  \nSeek the Bhojas and Andhakas who in Kuru-kshetra fell!\n\nThis is gallant Abhimanyu whom the fair Subhadra bore,  \nStill unconquered in the battle, slain by fraud in yonder shore,\n\nAbhimanyu son of Arjun, wielding Arjun\'s peerless might,  \nWith the Lord of Night he ranges, beauteous as the Lord of Night!\n\nThis, Yudhishthir, is thy father, by thy mother joined in heaven,  \nOft he comes into my mansions in his flowery chariot driven.\n\nThis is Bhishma stainless warrior, by the _Vasus_ is his place,  \nBy the god of heavenly wisdom teacher Drona sits in grace!\n\n_\n\nThese and other mighty warriors in the earthly battle slain,  \nBy their valour and their virtue walk the bright ethereal plain,\n\nThey have cast their mortal bodies, crossed the radiant gate of heaven,  \nFor to win celestial mansions unto mortals it is given,\n\nLet them strive by kindly action, gentle speech, endurance long,  \nBrighter life and holier future into sons of men belong!"\n\n_\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Epilogue](mahaepi.htm)\n\n'
