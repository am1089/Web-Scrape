Suta said :-- Thus asked by the son of Parik _s_ it, the king Janamejaya,\nthe best of the Brahma _n_ as, the son of Satyavati, Vyasa spoke, in detail,\nthe following :--\n\n\n\n2\\. The virtuous Janamejaya became very much sorry and despondent when he\nheard in detail the improper acts of his own father Parik _s_ it, the son of\nUttara.\n\n\n\n3\\. Owing to insulting the Brahmi _n_ boy, his father had to go to hell; and\nhe was constantly thinking how to release his father.\n\n\n\n4\\. The son is called \xc2\x93Puttra\xc2\x94 for he releases his father from the hell, named\n\xc2\x93Put\xc2\x94. He is the true son that can do so.\n\n\n\np. 277\n\n\n\n5-6. The fortunate son of Parik _s_ it became very much tormented and\nbewildered with fear when he heard what was the fate of his father, who died\nbitten by a serpent on the top of a palace, due to the curse of a Brahmi _n_ ,\nvoid of any bathing, charities, and the purificatory acts.\n\n\n\n7\\. When Vyasa returned home, Janamejaya asked him, the whole course of events\nof Nara Naraya _n_ a.\n\n\n\n8\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! When the terrible Hira _n_ ya Kas'ipoo was slain,\nhis son Prahlada was installed on his throne.\n\n\n\n9\\. During the government of Prahlada, the chief of the Daityas, the\nworshipper of the Brahma _n_ as and Devas, the kings on earth began with faith\nto do many sacrifices for the satisfaction of the Devas.\n\n\n\n10\\. The Brahma _n_ as were engaged in their Tapasya, Dharma, and in\nfrequenting the places of pilgrimages; the Vais'yas, in their trade; and the\nS'udras, in serving the other three classes.\n\n\n\n11\\. The incarnation of Hari, the Nri Simha (Man-Lion) made Prahlada, the king\nof the Daityas in the Patala (Nether regions); and Prahlada, engaged there,\nspent his time in the preservation and welfare of his subjects.\n\n\n\n12\\. Once, on a time, the great ascetics Chyavana Muni, the son of Bhrigu went\non his way to bathing in the river Narmada, at the place of pilgrimage, called\nVyarhitis'vara.\n\n\n\n13\\. There he saw the great river Reva and, while he was descending in the\nriver, a dreadful snake caught hold of him and carried him to the Patala. The\nMuni was greatly terrified and began to think of the Deva of the Devas,\nJanardana Vi _sn_ u.\n\n\n\n14-15. On remembering the lotus eyed Vi _sn_ u, the serpent lost his poison,\nand Chyavana Muni did not find any trouble, though carried to the Patala.\n\n\n\n16\\. Then the serpent, coming to know of the power of the Muni, left him for\nfear that the Muni might curse him; the snake afterwards repented very much.\n\n\n\n17\\. Chyavana, the best of the Munis, worshipped by the daughters of the\nserpents, roamed there and entered once into a beautiful palace of the Nagas\nand the Danavas.\n\n\n\n18\\. While he was walking, he was seen by the religious king of the Daityas,\nthe Prahlada.\n\n\n\n19\\. The lord of the Daityas on seeing him worshipped him and enquired of him\nthe cause of his coming there.\n\n\n\np. 278\n\n\n\n20\\. Are you sent here by Indra? Speak truly, O best of the Brahma _n_ as. Is\nit to pry into my kingdom out of the enmity between the Devas and the Daityas?\n\n\n\n21\\. Chyavana said :-- What have I to do with Indra? That I might be sent by\nhim, as his spy, messenger, to your city!\n\n\n\n22\\. O Chief of the Daityas! Know me as Chyavana, the son of Bhrigu, prompt in\nreligious duties and whose eye is illumined by knowledge. Do not fear that I\nam sent here by Indra.\n\n\n\n23\\. When I went to bathe in a place of pilgrimage, in the holy Narmada, and\ndropped into the river, a poisonous snake caught hold of me (and carried me\nhere).\n\n\n\n24\\. I took the name of Vi _sn_ u; and the serpent, hearing the Vi _sn_ u's\nname, became void of poison, and left me here as you see.\n\n\n\n25\\. O king! Coming here, I see you. You are a devotee of Vi _sn_ u; know me,\ntoo, a devotee of the same Vi _sn_ u.\n\n\n\n26\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Prahlada, the son of Hira _n_ ya Kas'ipu, on\nhearing his sweet words, gladly asked him about the various places of\npilgrimages.\n\n\n\n27\\. Prahlada said :-- O Best of Munis! Kindly describe to me, in detail,\nwhich are the places of pilgrimages on the earth, Patala, and in the Heavens,\nthat verily lead to holiness.\n\n\n\n28\\. Chyavana said :-- O King! He whose body, words, and mind have grown pure,\nto him, his every footstep is a place of pilgrimage; he, whose heart is impure\nand defiled, to him the holy Ganges even is a thing more hated and worse than\nthe Kika _t_ a country (the name of Behar).\n\n\n\n29\\. Every holy place will impart holiness to him whose mind is first pure and\ndeprived of sin.\n\n\n\n30-31. O Best of the Daityas! On the banks of the Ganges, are situated good\nmany cities, towns, villages, places to assemble, mines, small villages, the\nliving places of the aborigines, the chandalas, and kaivartas, the Hu _n_ as,\nBangas, the Khasas and the other Mlechchas.\n\n\n\n32\\. The inhabitants of the above places drink at their will the holy Ganges\nwater, equivalent to Brahma, and bathe therein and do other works.\n\n\n\n33\\. O King! There not even a single soul becomes pure. What use is a holy\nplace to him, whose heart becomes attached to the sensual objects and who can\ntherefore be called the lost souls.\n\n\n\np. 279\n\n\n\n34\\. Know, O king! the mind as the principal factor in any religious act or in\nany holy place. He who wants purity, let him first make his own mind pure.\n\n\n\n35\\. The residents in any holy place deceive others and thus incur great sins.\nThe sins committed in a place of pilgrimage can never be removed; they become\nunending and inexhaustible.\n\n\n\n36\\. As the fruit, Indravaru _n_ a, is never sweet though fully ripe, so whose\nheart is defiled, he can never be pure though he bathes hundreds and thousands\nof times in the Tirtha water.\n\n\n\n37\\. He who wants welfare of his own and others, he should first make his mind\npure; when his mind becomes pure, then, the purity of material things and the\npurity of conduct can have any effect; then and then only resorting to places\nof pilgrimages becomes efficacious.\n\n\n\n38-39. Always avoid company with the lowest class of persons in the holy\nplaces; it is far better to shew one's good will and compassion to all the\nsouls (jivas) by one's intellect and by one's acts. You have asked me about\nthe holy places of pilgrimages; I will now tell you those that are the best.\n\n\n\n40\\. O king! The holy Naimis'ara _n_ ya is the first, next Chakratirtha; next\nPuskaratirtha; there are many others besides these that cannot be counted. O\nBest of kings! There are lots of other holy places in this world.\n\n\n\n41-42. Vyasa said :-- O king! Prahlada, the king of the Daityas, on hearing\nthe Muni's words, became ready to go Naimis'ra _n_ ya and, with very much\ngladness, exclaimed to his followers, the Daityas :-- O Good Ones! Get up;\ntoday we will go to Naimis'ara _n_ ya and we will see the lotus eyed, yellow\nrobed S\xc2\x92ri Achyutam, the Vi _sn_ u.\n\n\n\n43\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! When thus addressed by Prahlada, the Demons were\nexceedingly glad; and they all marched out of Patala.\n\n\n\n44\\. The Daityas, and Demons all united went to Naimis'ara _n_ yam and filled\nwith much pleasure, they all bathed on reaching that holy place.\n\n\n\n45\\. There, accompanied by the Daityas, Prahlada roamed about the sacred\nplaces and saw the holy Sarasvati river and Her pure clean water.\n\n\n\n46\\. The highsouled Prahlada bathed in the Sarasvati river and his mind was\nsatisfied.\n\n\n\n47\\. The king of the Daityas was very much pleased and he perform ablutions\nand charities according to due rites in that most auspicious sacred place of\npilgrimage.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighth Chapter in the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam,\nthe Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa on going to\nthe Tirthas.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk04ch09.htm)\n\n"
