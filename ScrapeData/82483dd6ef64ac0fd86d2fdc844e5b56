Again shall I tell thee that supreme knowledge which is above all\nknowledge, having known which all the Munis have attained to high perfection\nafter this life. 1\n\np. 309\n\n2\\. They who having devoted themselves to this knowledge, have attained to My\nBeing, are neither born at the time of creation, nor are they troubled at the\ntime of dissolution.\n\n3\\. My womb is the great Prakriti; in that I place the germ; from thence, O\ndescendant of Bharata, is the birth of all beings. 3\n\np. 310\n\n4\\. Whatever forms are produced, O son of Kunti, in all the wombs, the great\nPrakriti is their womb, and I the seed-giving Father.\n\n5\\. Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas,--these Gunas, O mighty-armed, born of Prakriti,\nbind fast in the body the indestructible embodied one. 5\n\np. 311\n\n6\\. Of these Sattva, from its stainlessness luminous and free from evil,\nbinds, O sinless one, by attachment to happiness, and by attachment to\nknowledge. 6\n\n7\\. Know Rajas to be of the nature of passion, giving rise to thirst and\nattachment;\n\np. 312\n\nit binds fast, O son of Kunti, the embodied one, by attachment to action. 7\n\n8\\. And know Tamas to be born of ignorance, stupefying all embodied beings; it\nbinds fast, O descendant of Bharata, by miscomprehension, indolence, and\nsleep. 8\n\np. 313\n\n9\\. Sattva attaches to happiness, and Rajas to action, O descendant of\nBharata; while Tamas, verily, shrouding discrimination, attaches to\nmiscomprehension.\n\n10\\. Sattva arises, O descendant of Bharata, predominating over Rajas and\n'Tamas; and Rajas over Sattva and Tamas; so, Tamas over Sattva and Rajas. 10\n\np. 314\n\n11\\. When through every sense in this body, the light of intelligence shines,\nthen it should be known that Sattva is predominant. 11\n\n12\\. Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, unrest, longing--these arise\nwhen Rajas is predominant, O bull of the: Bharatas. 12\n\np. 315\n\n13\\. Darkness, inertness, miscomprehension, and delusion,--these arise when\nTamas is predominant, O descendant of Kuru. 13\n\n14\\. If the embodied one meets death when Sattva is predominant, then he\nattains to the spotless regions of the worshippers of the Highest. 14\n\np. 316\n\n15\\. Meeting death in Rajas he is born among those attached to action; so\ndying in Tamas, he is born in the wombs of the irrational. 15\n\n16\\. The fruit of good action, they say, is Sattvika and pure; verily, the\nfruit of Rajas is pain, and ignorance is the fruit of Tamas. 16\n\np. 317\n\n17\\. From Sattva arises wisdom, and greed from Rajas; miscomprehension,\ndelusion and ignorance arise from Tamas.\n\n18\\. The Sattva-abiding go upwards; the Rajasika dwell in the middle; and the\nTamasika, abiding in the function. of the lowest Guna, go downwards.\n\n19\\. When the seer beholds no agent other than the Gunas and knows That which\nis higher than the Gunas, he attains to My being. 19\n\np. 318\n\n20\\. The embodied one having gone beyond these three Gunas out of which the\nbody is evolved, is freed from birth, death, decay and pain, and attains to\nimmortality.\n\np. 319\n\nArjuna said:\n\n21\\. By what marks, O Lord, is he (known) who has gone beyond these three\nGunas? What is his conduct, and how does he pass beyond these three Gunas?\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n22\\. He who hates not the appearance of light, (the effect of Sattva),\nactivity (the effect of Rajas), and delusion (the effect of Tamas), (in his\nown mind), O Pandava, nor longs for them when absent; 22\n\np. 320\n\n23\\. He who, sitting like one unconcerned, is moved not by the Gunas, who,\nknowing that the Gunas operate, is Self-centred and swerves not;\n\n24\\. Alike in pleasure and pain, Self-abiding, regarding a clod of earth, a\nstone and gold alike; the same to agreeable and disagreeable, firm, the same\nin censure and, praise; 24\n\np. 321\n\n25\\. The same in honour and disgrace, the same to friend and foe,\nrelinquishing all undertakings--he is said to have gone beyond the Gunas. 25\n\n26\\. And he who serves Me with an unswerving devotion, he, going beyond the\nGunas, is fitted for becoming Brahman. 26\n\np. 322\n\n27\\. For I am the abode of Brahman, the Immortal and Immutable, of everlasting\nDharma and of Absolute Bliss. 27\n\n\n\nThe end of the fourteenth chapter designated, The Discrimination of the Three\nGunas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[308:1](sbg19.htm#fr_298) _After this life_ --after being freed from this\nbondage of the body.\n\n[309:3](sbg19.htm#fr_299) _Brahma:_ This word is derived from Brimh, 'to\nexpand,' and means here the vast seed or womb (the Prakriti) out of which the\ncosmos is evolved or expanded.\n\n_I place the germ:_ I infuse the reflection of My Intelligence, and this act\nof impregnation is the cause of the evolution of the cosmos.\n\n[310:5](sbg19.htm#fr_300) _These Gunas_ --are the primary constituents of the\nPrakriti and are the bases of all substances; they cannot therefore be said to\nbe attributes or qualities inhering in the substances as opposed to the\nsubstances.\n\n_Embodied one:_ he who abides in the body as if identified therewith.\n\n[311:6](sbg19.htm#fr_301) _Binds by attachment to happiness &c.:_ Binds the\nSelf by the consciousness of happiness and knowledge in the shape of 'I am\nhappy,' 'I am wise,' which belongs properly to the Kshetra, but which is\nassociated with the Self, the Absolute Intelligence and Bliss, through Avidya.\n\n[312:7](sbg19.htm#fr_302) _It binds &c._--Though the Self is not the agent,\nRajas makes Him act with the idea 'I am the doer.'\n\n[312:8](sbg19.htm#fr_303) _Stupefying:_ causing delusion or non-\ndiscrimination.\n\n[313:10](sbg19.htm#fr_304) When one or the other of the Gunas asserts itself\npredominating over the other two, it produces its own effect. Sattva produces\nknowledge and happiness; Rajas, action; Tamas, veiling of discrimination &c.\n\n[314:11](sbg19.htm#fr_305) _Every sense_ --lit., all the gates. All the senses\nare for the Self the gateways of perception.\n\n[314:12](sbg19.htm#fr_306) _Unrest_ --being agitated with joy, attachment &c.\n\n[315:13](sbg19.htm#fr_307) _Darkness, inertness:_ Absence of discrimination,\nand its results, inertness &c.\n\n[315:14](sbg19.htm#fr_308) _Spotless regions:_ The Brahma-loka and the like.\n\n_The Highest_ --Deities such as Hiranyagarbha.\n\n[316:15](sbg19.htm#fr_309) _Meeting . . . Rajas:_ If he dies when Rajas is\npredominant in him.\n\n[316:16](sbg19.htm#fr_310) _Rajas_ --means Rajasika action, and Tamas,--\nTamasika action, as this section treats of actions.\n\n[317:19](sbg19.htm#fr_311) _The Gunas_ --which transform themselves into the\nbodies, senses and sense-objects, and which in p. 318 all their modifications\nconstitute the agent in all actions.\n\n_Knows . . . the Gunas:_ Sees Him who is distinct from the Gunas, who is the\nWitness of the Gunas and of their functions.\n\n[319:22](sbg19.htm#fr_312) This answers Arjuna's first question. The man of\nright knowledge does not hate the effects of the three Gunas when they clearly\npresent themselves as objects of consciousness; nor does he long after things\nwhich have disappeared.\n\n[320:24](sbg19.htm#fr_313) _Self-abiding:_ He remains in his own true-nature.\n\n[321:25](sbg19.htm#fr_314) Inclining to neither of the dual throng, he firmly\ntreads the path of Self-knowledge, and rises above the Gunas.\n\nThese three Slokas are in answer to Arjuna's second question.\n\n[321:26](sbg19.htm#fr_315) This answers Arjuna's third question.\n\n[322:27](sbg19.htm#fr_316) _I_ --the Pratyagatman, the true Inner-Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fifteenth Chapter.
