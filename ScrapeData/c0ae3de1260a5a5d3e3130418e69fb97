She\nwould say, 'Poor little thing, her life is sad. Her mother wished so long for\na daughter, and then the girl was born and the mother died and never saw her\npoor child, or was able to ask any one to take care of her.' At which the\nwives of the six elder brothers would answer, 'You only take such notice of\nthe girl in order to vex us.' Then, while their husbands were away, they\ninvented wicked stories against their sister-in-law, which they told them on\ntheir return home; and their husbands believed them rather than her, and were\nvery angry with her, and ordered her to be turned out of the house. But the\nwife of the seventh brother did not believe what the six others said, and was\nvery kind to the little Princess, and sent her secretly as much food as she\ncould spare from her own dinner. But as they drove her from their door, the\nsix wives of the elder brothers cried out, 'Go away, wicked girl, go away, and\nnever let us see your face again until you marry Chundun Rajah!  1 When you\ninvite us to the wedding, and give us six eldest six common wooden stools to\nsit on, but the seventh sister (who always takes your part) a fine emerald\nchair, we will believe you innocent of all the evil deeds of which you are\naccused, but not till then!' This they said scornfully, railing at her; for\nChundun Rajah, of whom they spoke (who was the great Rajah of a neighbouring\ncountry) had been dead many months.\n\nSo, sad at heart, the Princess wandered forth into the jungle; and when she\nhad gone through it, she came upon another, still denser than the first. The\ntrees grew so thickly overhead that she could scarcely see the sky, and there\nwas no village nor house of living creature near. The food her youngest\nsister-in-law had given her was nearly exhausted, and she did not know where\nto get more. At last, however, after journeying on for many days, she came\nupon a large tank, beside which was a fine house that belonged to a Rakshas.\nBeing very tired, she sat down on the edge of the tank to eat some of the\nparched rice that remained of her store of provisions; and as she did so she\nthought, 'This house belongs doubtless to a Rakshas, who, perhaps, will see me\nand kill and eat me; but since no one cares for me, and I have neither home\nnor friends, I hold life cheap enough.' It happened, however, that the Rakshas\nwas then out, and there was no one in his house but a little cat and dog, who\nwere his servants.\n\nThe dog's duty was to take care of the saffron with which the Rakshas coloured\nhis face on high days and holidays, and the cat had charge of the antimony\nwith which he blackened his eyelids. Before the Princess had been long by the\ntank, the little cat spied her out, and running to her said, 'O sister,\nsister, I am so hungry, pray give me some of your dinner.' The Princess\nanswered, 'I have very little rice left; when it is all gone I shall starve.\nIf I give you some, what have you to give me in exchange?' The cat said, 'I\nhave charge of the antimony with which my Rakshas blackens his eyelids, I will\ngive you some of it;' and running to the house she fetched a nice little pot\nfull of antimony, which she gave to the Princess in exchange for the rice.\nWhen the little dog saw this, he also ran down to the tank, and said, 'Lady,\nLady, give me some rice, I pray you; for I, too, am very hungry.' But she\nanswered, 'I have very little rice left, and when it is all gone I shall\nstarve. If I give you some of my dinner, what will you give me in exchange?'\nThe dog said, 'I have charge of my Rakshas' saffron, with which he colours his\nface. I will give you some of it. So he ran to the house and fetched a\nquantity of saffron and gave it to the Princess, and she gave him also some of\nthe rice. Then, tying the antimony and saffron up in her saree, she said good-\nbye to the dog and cat and went on her way.\n\nThree or four days after this, she found she had nearly reached the other side\nof the jungle. The wood was not so thick, and in the distance she saw a large\nbuilding that looked like a great tomb. The Princess determined to go and see\nwhat it was, and whether she could find any one there to give her any food,\nfor she had eaten all the rice and felt very hungry, and it was getting\ntowards night.\n\nNow the place towards which the Princess went was the tomb of the Chundun\nRajab, but this she did not know.\n\nChundun Rajah had died many months before, and his father and mother and\nsisters, who loved him very dearly, could not bear the idea of his being\nburied under the cold ground; so they had built a beautiful tomb, and inside\nit they had placed the body on a bed under a canopy, and it had never decayed,\nbut continued as fair and perfect as when first put there. Every day Chundun\nRajah's mother and sisters would come to the place to weep and lament from\nsunrise to sunset; but each evening they returned to their own homes. Hard by\nwas a shrine and small hut where a Brahman lived, who had charge of the place;\nand from far and near people used to come to visit the tomb of their lost\nRajah, and see the great miracle, how the body of him who had been dead so\nmany months remained perfect and undecayed; but none knew why this was. When\nthe Princess got near the place a violent storm came on. The rain beat upon\nher and wetted her, and it grew so dark she could hardly see where she was\ngoing. She would have been afraid to go into the tomb had she known about\nChundun Rajah; but, as it was, the storm being so violent and night\napproaching, she ran in there for shelter as fast as she could, and sat down\nshivering in one corner. By the light of an oil lamp that burnt dimly in a\nniche in the wall, she saw in front of her the body of the Rajah lying under\nthe canopy, with the heavy jewelled coverlet over him, and the rich hangings\nall round. He looked as if he were only asleep, and she did not feel\nfrightened. But at twelve o'clock, to her great surprise, as she was watching\nand waiting, the Rajah came to life; and when he saw her sitting shivering in\nthe corner, he fetched a light and came towards her and said, 'Who are you?'\nShe answered, 'I am a poor lonely girl. I only came here for shelter from the\nstorm. I am dying of cold and hunger.' And then she told him all her story--\nhow that her sisters-in-law had falsely accused her, and driven her from among\nthem into the jungle, bidding her see their faces no more until she married\nthe Chundun Rajah, who had been dead so many months; and how the youngest had\nbeen kind to her and sent her food, which had prevented her from starving by\nthe way.\n\nThe Rajah listened to the Princess's words, and was certain that they were\ntrue, and she no common beggar from the jungles. For, for all her ragged\nclothes, she looked a royal lady, and shone like a star in the darkness.\nMoreover, her eyelids were darkened with antimony, and her beautiful face\npainted with saffron, like the face of a Princess. Then he felt a great pity\nfor her, and said, 'Lady, have no fear, for I will take care of you,' and\ndragging the rich coverlet off his bed he threw it over her to keep her warm,\nand going to the Brahman's house, which was close by, fetched some rice, which\nhe gave her to eat. Then he said, 'I am the Chundun Rajah of whom you have\nheard. I die every day, but every night I come to life for a little while.'\nShe cried, 'Do none of your family know of this? and if so, why do you stay\nhere in a dismal tomb?' He answered, 'None know it but the Brahman who has\ncharge of this place. Since my life is thus maimed, what would it avail to\ntell my family? It would but grieve them more than to think me dead.\nTherefore, I have forbidden him to let them know; and as my parents only come\nhere by day, they have never found it out. May be I shall some time wholly\nrecover, and till then I will be silent about my existence.' Then he called\nthe Brahman who had charge of the, tomb and the shrine (and who daily placed\nan offering of food upon it for the Rajah to eat when he came to life) and\nsaid to him, 'Henceforth place a double quantity of food upon the shrine, and\ntake care of this lady. If I ever recover, she shall be my Ranee.' And having\nsaid these words he died again. Then the Brahman took the Princess to his\nlittle hut, and bade his wife see that she wanted for nothing, and all the\nnext day she rested in that place. Very early in the morning Chundun Rajah's\nmother and sisters came to visit the tomb, but they did not see the Princess;\nand in the evening, when the sun was setting, they went away. That night when\nthe Chundun Rajah came to life he called the Brahman, and said to him, 'Is the\nPrincess still here?'--.'Yes,' he answered; 'for she is weary with her\njourney, and she has no home to go to.' The Rajah said, 'Since she has neither\nhome nor friends, if she be willing, you shall marry me to her, and she shall\nwander no further in search of shelter.' So the Brahman fetched his shastra  2\nand called all his family as witnesses, and married the Rajah to the little\nPrincess, reading prayers over them, and scattering rice and flowers upon\ntheir heads. And there the Chundun Ranee lived for some time. She was very\nhappy; she wanted for nothing, and the Brahman and his wife took as much care\nof her as if she had been their daughter. Every day she would wait outside the\ntomb, but at sunset she always returned to it and watched for her husband to\ncome to life. One night she said to him, 'Husband, I am happier to be your\nwife, and hold your hand and talk to you for two or three hours every evening,\nthan were I married to some great living Rajah for a hundred years. But oh!\nwhat joy it would be if you could come wholly to life again! Do you know what\nis the cause of your daily death? and what it is that brings you to life each\nnight at twelve o'clock?'\n\n'Yes,' he said, 'it is because I have lost my Chundun Har,  3 the sacred\nnecklace that held my soul. A Pen stole it. I was in the palace garden one\nday, when many of those winged ladies flew over my head, and one of them, when\nshe saw me, loved me, and asked me to marry her. But I said no, I would not;\nand at that she was angry, and tore the Chundun Har off my neck, and flew away\nwith it. That instant I fell down dead, and my father and mother caused me to\nbe placed in this tomb; but every night the Pen comes here and takes my\nnecklace off her neck, and when she takes it off I come to life again, and she\nasks me to come away with her, and marry her, and she does not put on the\nnecklace again for two or three hours, waiting to see if I will consent.\nDuring that time I live. But when she finds I will not, she puts on the\nnecklace again, and flies away, and as soon as she puts it on, I die. 4\\--'\nCannot the Pen be caught?' asked the Chundun Ranee; but her husband answered,\n'No, I have often tried to seize back my necklace--for if I could regain it I\nshould come wholly to life again,--but the Pen can at will render herself\ninvisible and fly away with it, so that it is impossible for any mortal man to\nget it.' At this news the Chundun Ranee was sad at heart, for she saw no hope\nof the Rajah's being restored to life; and grieving over this she became so\nill and unhappy, that even when she had a little baby boy born, it did not\nmuch cheer her, for she did nothing but think, 'My poor child will grow up in\nthis desolate place and have no kind father day by day to teach him and help\nhim as other children have, but only see him for a little while by night; and\nwe are all at the mercy of the Peri, who may any day fly quite away with the\nnecklace and not return.' The Brahman, seeing how ill she was, said to the\nChundun Rajah, 'The Ranee will die unless she can be somewhere where much care\nwill be taken of her, for in my poor home my wife and I can do but little for\nher comfort. Your mother and sister are good and charitable, let her go to the\npalace, where they will only need to see she is ill to take care of her.'\n\nNow it happened that in the palace courtyard there was a great slab of white\nmarble, on which the Chundun Rajah had been wont to rest on the hot summer\ndays; and because he used to be so fond of it, when he died his father and\nmother ordered that it should be taken great care of, and no one was allowed\nto so much as touch it. Knowing this, Chundun Rajah said to his wife, 'You are\nill; I should like you to go to the palace, where my mother and sisters will\ntake the greatest care of you. Do this, therefore--take our child and sit down\nwith him upon the great slab of marble in the palace courtyard. I used to be\nvery fond of it; and so now for my sake it is kept with the greatest care, and\nno one is allowed to so much as touch it. They will most likely see you there\nand order you to go away; but if you tell them you are ill, they will, I know,\nhave pity on you and befriend you.' The Chundun Ranee did as her husband told\nher; placing her little boy on the great slab of white marble in the palace\ncourtyard and sitting down herself beside him. Chundun Rajah's sister, who was\nlooking out of the window, saw her and cried, 'Mother, there are a woman and\nher child resting on my brother's marble slab; let us tell them to go away.'\nSo she ran down to the place; but when she saw Chundun Ranee and the little\nboy she was quite astonished. The Chundun Ranee was so fair and lovable-\nlooking, and the baby was the image of her dead brother. Then returning to her\nmother, she said, 'Mother, she who. sits upon the marble stone is the\nprettiest little lady I ever saw; and do not let us blame the poor thing, she\nsays she is ill and weary; and the baby (I know not if it is fancy, or the\nseeing him on that stone) seems to me the image of my lost brother.'\n\nAt this the old Ranee and the rest of the family went out, and when they saw\nthe Chundun Ranee they all took such a fancy to her and to the child that they\nbrought her into the palace, and were very kind to her, and took great care of\nher; so that in a\n\nwhile she got well and strong again, and much less unhappy; and they all made\na great pet of the little boy, for they were struck with his strange likeness\nto the dead Rajah; and after a time they gave his mother a small house to live\nin, close to the palace, where they often used to go and visit her. There also\nthe Chundun Rajah would go each night when he came to life, to laugh and talk\nwith his wife, and play with his boy, although he still refused to tell his\nfather and mother of his existence. One day it happened, however, that the\nlittle child told one of the Princesses (Chundun Rajah's sister) how every\nevening some one who came to the house used to laugh and talk with his mother\nand play with him, and then go away. The Princess also heard the sound of\nvoices in the Chundun Ranee's house, and saw lights flickering about there\nwhen they were supposed to be fast asleep. Of this she told her mother,\nsaying, 'Let us go down to-morrow night and see what this means; perhaps the\nwoman we thought so poor, and befriended thus, is nothing but a cheat, and\nentertains all her friends every night at our expense.'\n\nSo the next evening they went down softly, softly to the place, when they saw\n--not the strangers they had expected, but their long-lost Chundun Rajah!\nThen, since he could not escape he told them all. How that every night for an\nhour or two he came to life, but was dead all day. And they rejoiced greatly\nto see him again, and reproached him for not letting them know he ever lived,\nthough for so short a time. He then told them how he had married the Chundun\nRanee, and thanked them for all their loving care of her.\n\nAfter this he used to come every night and sit and talk with them; but still\neach day, to their great sorrow, he died; nor could they divine any means for\ngetting back his Chundun Han, which the Pen wore round her neck.\n\nAt last one evening, when they were all laughing and chatting together, seven\nPens flew into the room unobserved by them, and one of the seven was the very\nPen who had stolen Chundun Rajah's necklace, and she held it in her hand.\n\nAll the young Pens were very fond of the Chundun Rajah and Chundun Ranee's\nboy, and used often to come and play with him, for he was the image of his\nfather's and mother's loveliness, and as fair as the morning; and he used to\nlaugh and clap his little hands when he saw them coming; for though men and\nwomen cannot see Pens, little children can.\n\nChundun Rajah was tossing the child up in the air when the Pens flew into the\nroom, and the little boy was laughing merrily. The winged ladies fluttered\nround the Rajah and the child, and she that had the necklace hovered over his\nhead. Then the boy, seeing the glittering necklace which the Peri held,\nstretched out his little arms and caught hold of it; and, as he seized it, the\nstring broke, and all the beads fell upon the floor. At this the seven Pens\nwere frightened, and flew away, and the Chundun Ranee, collecting the beads,\nstrung them, and hung them round the Rajah's neck; and there was great joy\namongst those that loved him, because he had recovered the sacred necklace,\nand that the spell which doomed him to death was broken.\n\nThe glad news was soon known throughout the kingdom, and all the people were\nhappy and proud to hear it, crying, 'We have lost our young Rajah for such a\nlong, long time, and now one little child has brought him back to life.' And\nthe old Rajah and Ranee (Chundun Rajah's father and mother) determined that he\nshould be married again to the Chundun Ranee with great pomp and splendour,\nand they sent letters into all the kingdoms of the world, saying, 'Our son the\nChundun Rajah has come to life again, and we pray you come to his wedding.'\n\nThen, among those who accepted the invitation were the Chundun Ranee's seven\nbrothers and their seven wives; and for her six sisters-in-law, who had been\nso cruel to her, and caused her to be driven out into the jungle, the Chundun\nRanee prepared six common wooden stools; but for the seventh, who had been\nkind to her, she made ready an emerald throne, and a footstool adorned with\nemeralds.\n\nWhen all the Ranees were taken to their places, the six eldest complained,\nsaying, 'How is this? Six of us are given only common wooden stools to sit\nupon, but the seventh has an emerald chair?' Then the Chundun Ranee stood up,\nand before the assembled guests told them her story, reminding her six elder\nsistersin-law of their former taunts, and how they had forbidden her to see\nthem again until the day of her marriage with the Chundun Rajah, and she\nexplained how unjustly they had accused her to her brothers. When the Ranees\nheard this they were struck dumb with fear and shame, and were unable to\nanswer a word; and all their husbands, being much enraged to learn how they\nhad conspired to kill their sister-in-law, commanded that these wicked women\nshould be instantly hanged, which was accordingly done.\n\nThen, on the same day that the Chundun Rajah remarried their sister, the six\nelder brothers were married to six beautiful ladies of the court, amid great\nand unheard-of rejoicings, and from that day they all lived together in\nperfect peace and harmony unto their lives' end.\n\n![](img/43.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd24.htm#fr_73) King Sandalwood.\n\n[2](odd24.htm#fr_74) Sacred books.\n\n[3](odd24.htm#fr_75) Sandalwood necklace.\n\n[4](odd24.htm#fr_76) See Notes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXI.
