Because release is taught of him who takes his stand on it.\n\n_\n\nS_ vetaketu, who is desirous of final release, is at first--by means of the\nclause 'Thou art that'--instructed to meditate on himself as having his Self\nin that which truly is; and thereupon the passage 'for him there is delay'\nonly as long as 'I shall not be released, then I shall\n\np. 204\n\nbe united' teaches that for a man taking his stand upon that teaching there\nwill be Release, i.e. union with Brahman--which is delayed only until this\nmortal body falls away. If, on the other hand, the text would teach that the\nnon-intelligent Pradhana is the general cause, it could not possibly teach\nthat meditation on this Pradhana being a man's Self is the means towards his\nRelease. A man taking his stand on such meditation rather would on death be\nunited with a non-sentient principle, according to the scriptural saying,\n'According as his thought is in this world, so will he be when he has departed\nthis life' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 1). And Scripture, which is more loving than\neven a thousand parents, cannot possibly teach such union with the Non-\nsentient, which is acknowledged to be the cause of all the assaults of\nsuffering in its threefold form. Moreover, those who hold the theory of the\nPradhana being the cause of the world do not themselves maintain that he who\ntakes his stand upon the Pradhana attains final release.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8.
