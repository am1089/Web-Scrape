Then she, in lowly mood,  \nTo that high saint her speech renewed:  \n'So judge not they who wisest are:  \nThe Brahman's might is mightier far.  \nFor Brahmans strength from Heaven derive,  \nAnd warriors bow when Brahmans strive.  \nA boundless power 'tis thine to wield:  \nTo such a king thou shouldst not yield,  \nWho, very mighty though he be,--  \nSo fierce thy strength,--must bow to thee.  \nCommand me, Saint. Thy power divine  \nHas brought me here and made me thine;  \nAnd I, howe'er the tyrant boast,  \nWill tame his pride and slay his host.'  \nThen cried the glorious sage: 'Create  \nA mighty force the foe to mate,'  \n\nShe lowed, and quickened into life,  \nPahlavas, 1 burning for the strife,  \nKing Vis'vamitra's army slew  \nBefore the very leader's view.  \nThe monarch in excessive ire,  \nHis eyes with fury darting fire,  \nRained every missile on the foe  \nTill all the Pahlavas were low.  \nShe, seeing all her champions slain,  \nLying by thousands on the plain.  \nCreated, by her mere desire,  \nYavans and S'akas, fierce and dire.  \nAnd all the ground was overspread  \nWith Yavans and with S'akas dread:  \nA host of warriors bright and strong,  \nAnd numberless in closest throng:  \nThe threads within the lotus stem,  \nSo densely packed, might equal them.  \nIn gold-hued mail 'gainst war's attacks,  \nEach bore a sword and battle-axe.  \nThe royal host, where'er these came,  \nFell as if burnt with ravening flame.  \n\nThe monarch, famous through the world  \nAgain his fearful weapons hurled,  \n\nThat made Kambojas, [1b](ry055.htm#fn_227) Barbars, [2b](ry055.htm#fn_228)\nall,  \nWith Yavans, troubled, flee and fall.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[66:1](ry054.htm#fr_226) It is well known that the Persians were called\nPahlavas by the Indians. The _S'akas_ are nomad tribes inhabiting Central\nAsia, the Scythes of the Greeks, whom the Persians also, as Herodotus tells\nus, called S'akas just as the Indians did. Lib.

The name Yavana seems to be used rather\nindefinitely for nations situated beyond Persia to the west.... After the time\nof Alexander the Great the Indians as well as the Persians called the Greeks\nalso Yavans.' SCHLEGEL.\n\nLassen thinks that the Pahlavas were the same people as the \xce\xa0\xce\xac\xce\xba\xcf\x84\xcf\x85\xce\xb5\xcf\x82 of\nHerodotus, and that this non-Indian people, dwelt on the north-west confines\nof India.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LV.: The Hermitage Burnt.](ry055.htm)\n\n"
