Though he was the head of a wealthy and influential\nfamily, he spent most of his life in retirement from the world, in study,\nmeditation, and contemplation. He has reached now what is considered a very\nhigh age in India, eighty-two, and we are glad to hear that he has written an\nautobiography to be published after his death. As the friend and protector of\nKeshub Chunder Sen, though for a time separated from him, he has acted a far\nmore important part in the history of the Brahma-Samaj than is commonly\nsupposed. The following account of a visit lately paid to him by some members\nof the Brahma-Samaj will give us an idea of the life of this\n\np. 17\n\nman. I am in possession of some of his letters, which are very instructive,\nbut which are hardly fit for publication. Some friends who visited him lately\ngive the following account of their interview with the old Saint.\n\n\'We were conducted to the spacious verandah on the second story, where the\nvenerable old man was seated on a chair. We bowed down reverentially and took\nour seats. The Maharshi was the first to speak. He said: "Since you came here\nthree months ago, my communication with the external world has been much\ndiminished. I see things much less and hear much fewer words. But that is no\nloss to me. As my dealings with the external world are decreasing, my Yoga\nwith the internal world is rapidly increasing. No effort on my part is now\nrequired for communion. I sit by myself and enjoy this company." As he spoke\nthese words his countenance glowed with emotion.\n\nOn being asked if he remembered the different occasions on which he selected\nthe verses from the Vedantic texts to form the liturgy of the Brahma-Samaj\n(published by him many years ago), the Saint replied: "I cannot call back to\nmy mind after such a length of time the process through which these texts were\nbrought together from different Upanishads. I have got the essence of these\nthings within me now, and I am enjoying the sweetness thereof. So there is now\nno more need for me to go to the texts. I fully agree with you, that from the\nTrue and the Intelligent we go to the Infinite person, and that then we find\nin the Infinite infinite splendours and behold his infinite mercy and other\nattributes. I might have talked much\n\np. 18\n\nwith you on these subjects, had you come a short time before this. Now my mind\nis mostly occupied with things which the eyes see not nor the ears hear, so I\nshall not be able to talk much with you. . . . I have written an account of my\nlife as I have been moved by the Spirit of God, but I do not know of what use\nit will be. Now I have become quite useless to the world. I have now very\nlittle to connect me with the world." When we replied that we did not consider\nhis life to have been in vain, as he had given the world an example of a life\nlived in and with God, the Maharshi continued, "I am living the life of a\nrecluse, I have no energy left. The energy and earnestness you see in me now\nis roused only by seeing you. Long, long ago, while I was studying the\nUpanishads, a great light dawned upon my soul and I felt that India would one\nday worship Brahman, the Only True God. I then badly wanted a companion, a man\nafter my own heart, who would have my feelings and join hands with me. I tried\nalmost all the men of light and leading of the time, but could find none. I\nthen left Calcutta in despair and repaired to the hills. After a two years\'\nstay there, the fall of the river Sutlej suggested to my mind a sacred lesson.\nI heard a voice urging me to go to Calcutta and resume my holy work. I was so\nmuch engrossed with this divine voice that nothing would give me rest. Every\nobject seemed to reverberate the Divine injunction and press me to fulfil the\nLord\'s will. In all haste I came back, and as I came back, Brahmananda (Keshub\nChunder Sen) made my acquaintance. I saw at once that he was exactly the\n\np. 19\n\nright man whom I wanted. I could then discern why I was led by the Spirit to\ncome back to Calcutta. My joy knew no bounds. We passed the greater portion of\nthe nights in conversation about deep spiritual matters, even up to two in the\nmorning. Brahmananda even told me that when he would be gone, those whom he\nwould leave behind would express and promote my cause. I find his words are\ngoing to be fulfilled now." "Yes," we replied, "that is very true. While our\nminister was with us in the flesh, we did not realise our nearness unto you so\nmuch. Our impression is that the Brahma-Samaj has accepted Raja Rammohun Roy,\nbut has not yet accepted you. As you represent Yoga or direct vision of God,\nthe Brahma-Samaj will not be able to attain to that feature of spirituality,\nunless it accepts you. The present deplorable state of the Brahma-Samaj is\nowing to its non-acceptance of you." The Maharshi replied: "God has called you\nto preach the Brahma Dharma to this poor country of India, and particularly to\nBengal--our weak, indigent, and helpless country. As the mother loves her\ndecrepit child more tenderly, so God has shown this greater love to these His\npoor ones. For this special grace we are peculiarly thankful to God. God has\nshown special favour to you, and has made you particularly fit for your work.\nI have published my last work about Paraloka and Mukti, the next world and\nsalvation, in a small volume. I make an offering of it to you." After these\nwords the pilgrims departed, much comforted and helped 1.\'\n\np. 20\n\nI thought that this glimpse at what passes in India within doors, and is but\nseldom seen or even suspected by those who tell us so much about the palaces,\nthe Rajahs and Maharajahs, the car of Juggernath, the Towers of Silence, or\nthe Caves of Ellora, was worth preserving and might interest the true friends\nof India.\n\nWe have but to open the Indian papers to meet with notices of men who have led\nthe same saintly and God-devoted life as Debendranath Tagore, but who\nnevertheless have not reached the rank of a Paramaha _m_ sa in the eyes of the\npeople of India. It is quite possible that some of them who are venerated as\nSaints in their own country, would be disposed of as fools or fanatics by\nEuropean critics. Still they hold their own place in their own country, and\nthey represent a power which ought not to be entirely neglected by the rulers\nof \'weak, indigent, helpless Bengal.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[19:1](rls10.htm#fr_6) Unity and the Minister, 1896, July 12.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Rai Shaligram Saheb Bahadur](rls11.htm)\n\n'
