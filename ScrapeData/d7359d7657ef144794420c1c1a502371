Having set free the horse, he (the Adhvaryu) spreads a cushion\nwrought of gold (threads) south of the Vedi: thereon the Hot _ri_ seats\nhimself. On the right (south) of the Hot _ri_ , the Sacrificer on a gold stool\n2; on the right of him, the Brahman\n\np. 361\n\nand Udgat _ri_ on cushions wrought of gold; in front of them, with his face to\nthe west, the Adhvaryu on a gold stool, or a slab of gold.\n\n13:4:3:22\\. When they are seated together, the Adhvaryu calls upon (the Hot\n_ri_ ), saying, 'Hot _ri_ , recount the beings: raise thou this Sacrificer\nabove the beings 1!' Thus called upon, the Hot _ri_ , being about to tell the\nPariplava 2 Legend, addresses (the Adhvaryu), 'Adhvaryu!'--'Havai 3 hotar!'\nreplies the Adhvaryu.\n\n13:4:3:33\\. 'King Manu Vaivasvata,' he says;--'his people are Men, and they\nare staying here 4;'--\n\np. 362\n\nhouseholders, unlearned in the scriptures, have come thither 1: it is these he\ninstructs;--'The _Ri_ k (verses) are the Veda 2: this it is;' thus saying, let\nhim go over a hymn of the _Ri_ _k_ , as if reciting it 3. Masters of lute-\nplayers have come\n\np. 363\n\nthither: these he calls upon, 'Masters of lute-players,' he says, 'sing ye of\nthis Sacrificer along with righteous kings of yore 1!' and they accordingly\nsing of him; and in thus singing of him, they make him share the same world\nwith the righteous kings of yore.\n\n13:4:3:44\\. Having called (on the masters of lute-players), the Adhvaryu\nperforms the Prakrama oblations 2, either on the southern fire, or on a\nfootprint of the horse, after drawing lines round it--whichever is the\npractice there; but the former 3 is the established rule.\n\np. 364\n\n13:4:3:55\\. Prior to the (first) offering to Savit _ri_ he offers, once only,\nthe (oblations relating to the) Forms 1 in the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, whilst going\nrapidly over (the formulas). And in the evening, whilst the Dh _ri_ tis 2\n(oblations for the safe keeping of the horse) are being offered, a Ra _g_ anya\nlute-player, striking up the uttaramandra (tune) south (of the vedi), sings\nthree stanzas composed by himself (on topics 3 such as), 'Such war he waged,--\nSuch battle he won:' the meaning of this has been explained.\n\n13:4:3:66\\. And on the morrow, the second day, after those (three) offerings\nto Savit _ri_ have been performed in the same way, there is that same course\n\np. 365\n\nof procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hot _ri_ ) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the\nAdhvaryu.--'King Yama Vaivasvata 1,' he (the Hot _ri_ ) says, 'his people are\nthe Fathers, and they are staying here;'--old men have come thither: it is\nthese he instructs;--'The Ya _g_ us-formulas are the Veda: this it is;' thus\nsaying, let him go over a chapter (anuvaka) of the Ya _g_ us 2, as if reciting\nit. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but\ndoes not perform the Prakrama oblations.\n\n13:4:3:77\\. And on the third day, after those (three) offerings have been\nperformed in the same way, there is that same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!'\nhe (the Hot _ri_ ) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Varu _n_\na \xc3\x82ditya,' he says; 'his people are the Gandharvas, and they are staying\nhere;'--handsome youths have come thither: it is these he instructs;--'The\nAtharvans are the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him go over one section\n(parvan) of the Atharvan 3, as if reciting\n\np. 366\n\nit. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but\ndoes not perform the Prakrama oblations.\n\n13:4:3:88\\. And on the fourth day, after those (three) offerings have been\nperformed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!'\nhe (the Hot _ri_ ) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Soma\nVaish _n_ ava 1,' he says; 'his people are the Apsaras, and they are staying\nhere;'--handsome maidens have come thither: it is these he instructs 2;--'The\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras are the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him go over one section of\nthe A\xe1\xb9\x85giras 3, as if reciting it. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the\nmasters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.\n\n13:4:3:99\\. And on the fifth day, after those (three) offerings have been\nperformed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!'\nhe (the Hot _ri_ ) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the\n\np. 367\n\n[paragraph continues] Adhvaryu.--'King Arbuda Kadraveya 1,' he says; 'his\npeople are the Snakes, and they are staying here;'--both snakes and snake-\ncharmers 2 have come thither: it is these he instructs--'The Sarpavidya\n(science of snakes) is the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him go over one\nsection of the Sarpavidya 3 as if reciting it. The Adhvaryu calls in the same\nway (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama\noblations.\n\n13:4:3:1010\\. And on the sixth day, after those (three) offerings have been\nperformed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!'\nhe (the Hot _ri_ ) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Kubera\nVai _s_ rava _n_ a,' he says; 'his people are the Rakshas, and they are\nstaying here;'--evil-doers, robbers 4, have come thither: it\n\np. 368\n\nis these he instructs;--'The Deva _g_ anavidya 1 (demonology) is the Veda:\nthis it is;' thus saying, let him go over one section of the Deva _g_\nanavidya, as if he were reciting it. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on\nthe masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.\n\n13:4:3:1111\\. And on the seventh day, after those (three) offerings have been\nperformed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!'\nhe (the Hot _ri_ ) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Asita\nDhanva 2,' he says; 'his people are the Asura; and they are staying here;'--\nusurers have come thither: it is these he instructs;--'Magic 3 is the Veda:\nthis it is;' thus saying, let him perform some magic trick. The Adhvaryu calls\nin the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the\nPrakrama oblations.\n\n13:4:3:1212\\. And on the eighth day, after those (three) offerings have been\nperformed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!'\nhe (the Hot _ri_ ) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the\n\np. 369\n\n[paragraph continues] Adhvaryu.--'King Matsya Sammada 1,' he says; 'his people\nare the water-dwellers, and they are staying here;'--both fish and fishermen 2\nhave come thither: it is these he instructs;--'the Itihasa 3 is the Veda: this\nit is;' thus saying, let him tell some Itihasa. The Adhvaryu calls in the same\nway (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama\noblations.\n\n13:4:3:1313\\. And on the ninth day, after those (three) offerings have been\nperformed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!'\nhe (the Hot _ri_ ) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Tarkshya\nVaipa _s_ yata 4,' he says; 'his people are the Birds, and they are staying\nhere;'--both birds and bird-catchers 5 have come thither: it is these he\ninstructs;--'the Pura _n_ a 3 is the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him\ntell some Pura _n_ a 6. The Adhvaryu calls\n\np. 370\n\nin the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the\nPrakrama oblations.\n\n13:4:3:1414\\. And on the tenth day, after those (three) offerings have been\nperformed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!'\nhe (the Hot _ri_ ) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Dharma\nIndra 1,' he says, 'his people are the Gods, and they are staying here;'--\nlearned _s_ rotriyas (theologians), accepting no gifts 2, have come thither:\nit is these he instructs; 'the Saman (chant-texts) are the Veda: this it is;'\nthus saying, let him repeat 3 a decade of the Saman. The Adhvaryu calls in the\nsame way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama\noblations.\n\n13:4:3:1515\\. [In telling] this revolving (legend), he tells all royalties,\nall regions, all Vedas, all gods, all beings; and, verily, for whomsoever the\nHot _ri_ , knowing this, tells this revolving legend, or whosoever even knows\nthis, attains to fellowship and communion with these royalties, gains the\nsovereign rule and lordship over all people, secures for himself all the\nVedas, and, by gratifying the gods, finally establishes himself on all beings.\nThis very same legend revolves again and again for a year; and. inasmuch as it\nrevolves again and again, therefore\n\np. 371\n\nit is (called) the revolving (legend). For thirty-six ten-days' periods he\ntells it,--the B _ri_ hati (metre) consists of thirty-six syllables, and\ncattle are related to the B _ri_ hati metre: by means of the B _ri_ hati he\nthus secures cattle for him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[360:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_930) At [XI, 5, 3, 4](sbe44027.htm#11:5:3:4);\n[7](sbe44027.htm#11:5:3:7) 'kur _k_ a' seems to mean a bunch or pad of grass,\nused as a seat. In the present instance it is explained as p. 361 a seat with\nfeet (sapadam asanam, Schol. on Katy. XX, 2, 19), or as a seat or stool which\nhas the appearance of a pad (pi _th_ a _m_ kur _k_ ak _ri_ ti,? i.e. with a\npad on it). According to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. X, 6, 19) the king is surrounded by\nhis sons and ministers.\n\n[361:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_931) Or, perhaps, 'raise this Sacrificer above (or, up\nto) the things of the past;' but see [paragraph 15](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:15).\n\n[361:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_932) That is, the 'revolving, recurrent, or cyclic\nlegend,' so called because it is renewed every ten days during the year.\n\n[361:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_933) Harisvamin explains this interjection, as if it\nwere 'hvayai' = pratihvayai, 'I will respond, I am ready to respond;' and,\nthough this is probably a fanciful explanation, the arrangements made on this\noccasion are clearly such as to suggest a studied resemblance to the call and\ncounter-call of the two priests on all occasions of a solemn utterance of\nsacrificial formulas, or the recitation of hymns, as at the Prataranuvaka\n(part ii, p. 226 seqq.). Katy. XX, 3, 2, accordingly, calls it the Adhvaryu's\n'pratigara,' or response. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. X, 6, 13 makes the Adhvaryu's answer\n'ho hotar'; and Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kh. _S_ r. XVI, 1 'hoyi hotar.'\n\n[361:4](sbe44104.htm#fr_934) The Hot _ri_ 's utterances on the ten days of the\nrevolving period (as set forth in passages 2-14) occur also, with some\nvariations of detail, in the manuals defining the Hot _ri_ 's duties, viz. the\n\xc3\x82 _s_ valayana (X, 7) and _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana (XVI, 2) Sutras (whilst the works of\nthe Taittiriyakas seem to have nothing corresponding to this performance).\nBoth Sutras omit 'ra _g_ a' each time. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, moreover, omits also\nthe 'iti' along with it, because he does not interrupt the formula by an\ninsertion, as is done here (ity aha) p. 362 and in the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. (iti\nprathame, &c.). Gargya Naraya _n_ a, on \xc3\x82 _s_ v. X, 7, 1, takes the opening\nwords 'prathame (&c.) \xe0\xa4\xbdhani' to form part of the formulas:--'on the first day\nManu Vaivasvata (is king); but it is clear from the other two authorities that\nthis cannot have been intended by the author of that Sutra.--The commentator\non _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. XVI, 2 remarks, 'Manur Vaivasvato ra _g_ ety-evam-adikam\nakhyana _m_ pariplavakhya _m_ prathamahany a _k_ ash _t_ e . . . tasya ra _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ o manushya vi _s_ a _h_ pra _g_ as ta ima asate\xe0\xa4\xbddyapi svadharman na _k_\nalanti,' thus apparently taking 'ra _g_ a' to form part of the formula, or\nrather of the topic of which the legend to be recited was to treat. This\ncommentary thus apparently assumes that the legend begins with 'Manur\nVaivasvato ra _g_ a'; and that the subsequent clause leads on to the\nrecitation of the Vedic text that is to follow (cf. note on paragraph\n8);--though. possibly this latter clause (as Professor M. Muller seems to take\nit) may only be an argumentative one, giving the reason why the householders\nare to be instructed. Cf. M. Muller, Hist. of Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 37 seqq.\n\n[362:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_935) 'Householders should be brought thither' (i.e.\nshould be made to join this performance); \xc3\x82 _s_ v.-sutra. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. has merely\n'thereby he instructs householders.' G _ri_ hamedhina _h_ are those who\nregularly perform the five great domestic sacrifices (mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a).\n\n[362:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_936) Or, more closely, the Veda is the, or consists\nof, _Ri_ _k_ (verses). Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. reads ' _ri_ _k_ o veda _h_ ' (the Veda of\nthe _Ri_ _k_ , gen. sing.) instead of ' _ri_ _k_ a _h_ ' (nom. pl.), and in\nthe subsequent paragraph also, it repeats the word 'veda' (Ya _g_ urveda,\nAtharvaveda, A\xe1\xb9\x85 _g_ iraso veda _h_ ).\n\n[362:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_937) That is, as would seem,--as if he were to recite\nit (or, as when he recites it) in the course of the ordinary sacrificial\nperformance--as in _S_ astras, the Prataranuvaka, &c. The text would, however,\nalso admit of the translation--'thus saying, let him go over (the legend) as\nif he were reciting a hymn of the _Ri_ _k_ ,' but it is not quite easy to see\nhow a similar interpretation would suit subsequent paragraphs (11-14).\nMoreover, both \xc3\x82 _s_ v. and Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kh. omit 'vya _k_ aksha _n_ a iti,' and read\n'nigadet,' 'let him recite (a hymn),' p. 363 instead of 'anudravet (let him\nrun, or go, over = anupurvam u _k_ _k_ arayet, Harisv.).' Yet, the commentary\non _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. supplies the 'iva,' explaining as he does, 'sukta _m_ ki _m_ _k_\nid a _k_ aksha _n_ a ivanuvadet;' from which (if it is not simply quoted from\nour Brahma _n_ a) it would almost seem as if he, too, thought of the legend\nrather than a hymn of the _Ri_ _k_. The verb 'vya- _k_ aksh,' as against 'ni-\ngad,' seems to imply a clear articulation--perhaps even with all the stops or\npauses, at the end of every half-verse, or pada, as the case might be. Saya\n_n_ a (on Taitt. Br. II, 2, 1, 4; 2, 6) explains 'vya _k_ akshita' by 'vispash\n_t_ am u _k_ _k_ arayet (or, pa _th_ et).' The available MS. of Harisvamin's\ncommentary on our text is, as usual, incorrect, but as far as it goes, it\nseems to favour the recitation of the legend at this place,--'vya _k_ aksha\n_n_ a iti vakya _s_ as _k_ idan (r. _kh_ indan) agai _s_ _k_ abhidad (?) ity\nartha _h_ ,'--which I take to mean that he is to pause after each sentence, as\nhe would do when reciting a hymn.\n\n[363:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_938) That is, according to Harisvamin,--'Compare this\nSacrificer in song with the old righteous kings.' Katy. XX, 3, 8 refers to\nthese latter as 'ra _g_ arshis,' or royal sages--in which case the recitation\nof the legend itself would only come in here.\n\n[363:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_939) For the formulas used with this series of forty-\nnine oblations, see [XIII, 1, 3, 5](sbe44076.htm#13:1:3:5) with notes thereon.\n\n[363:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_940) That is to say, according to Harisvamin, the\ncourse of procedure laid down in [XIII, 1, 3, 7](sbe44076.htm#13:1:3:7),\naccording to which these oblations are to be made on the \xc3\x82havaniya, and not\neither on the southern fire, or on a footprint of the horse.\n\n[364:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_941) That is to say, the Prakramas which are only\nperformed on the first day of the year, whilst the three oblations to Savit\n_ri_ are repeated each day.\n\n[364:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_942) See XIII, 1, 4, 3; 6, 2. These oblations are made\njust prior to the evening performance of the Agnihotra, when the \xc3\x82havaniya has\nbeen got ready for the latter. The Taittiriyakas seem to make these four\noblations on the horse's feet at the place where the keepers pass the night\n(viz. the carpenter's house) during the greater part of the year; and only in\nthe last month, when a stable of A _s_ vattha wood has been put up for the\nhorse near (or on) the offering-ground, these oblations take place on the\n\xc3\x82havaniya. See comm. on Taitt. Br. III, 8, 12 (p. 609; cp. p. 700). At III, 9,\n14 (p. 703), on the other hand, it is stated that the Ra _g_ anya's singing is\nto take place in the evening at the time of the Dh _ri_ ti-homas.\n\n[364:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_943) Taitt. Br. III, 9, 54, 4, again mentions three\ntopics, one for each stanza--viz. 'thus (i.e. in the same way as P _ri_ thu,\nBharata, Bhagiratha, Yudhish _th_ ira &c., comm.) didst thou overpower (the\nenemies), thus (i.e. surrounded by heroic warriors, fighting on elephants,\nsteeds, chariots, and on foot, with bows and arrows, spears, swords, &c.)\ndidst thou battle, thus didst thou fight such and such battle (i.e. like\nYudhish _th_ ira, Dushyanta, &c., having engaged in a battle attended by\nthousands of great heroes, thou, armed only with thy sharp sword, didst slay\nthe king of Kashmir, Magadha, Pu _n_ _d_ ra, &c., comm.).'\n\n[365:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_944) When the comm. on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. remarks, 'Yamo\nVaivasvato ra _g_ ety aheti divitiya evahani _S_ atapathe dar _s_ anat,' this\nwould seem to refer to the addition of either 'ra _g_ a,' or 'ahani,' but not\nto any legend of Y. V., since such a one does not occur in this work; though\nvarious passages in the _Ri_ _k_ might no doubt have sufficed to construct\nsome such legend as would have served on this occasion.\n\n[365:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_945) The same commentator refers to the '\xc3\x82 _s_\nvamedhika' as the section to be recited,--'prakara _n_ at,' because of the\ntreatment (therein of this subject).\n\n[365:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_946) Instead of 'atharva _n_ am eka _m_ parva,' the\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. has 'bhesha _g_ am (medicine),' which the commentator--against\nthe opinion of those who take it to mean the hymn _Ri_ g-veda X, 97 (treating\nof the magic powers of herbs)--makes a special work of the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas;\nwhilst the \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. reads 'yad bhesha _g_ a _m_ ni _s_ anta _m_ p. 366 syat\ntan nigadet'--'let him tell some approved medicine (i. e: some specific, or\ncharm against disease).'\n\n[366:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_947) The comm. on Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. remarks, 'Somo Vaish _n_\nava iti _k_ aturthe; Somo Vaish _n_ avo ra _g_ eti Satapatha _s_ rute _h_ ;\npratikagraha _n_ any etani.' This seems to show clearly that he takes this as\nmerely the opening words of the legend. Here, again, his words can hardly be\ntaken to refer to a legend regarding Soma in the Satapatha-Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[366:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_948) 'Yuvati _h_ _s_ obhana upadi _s_ ati, tasyaita\n_h_ (? tasyaitabhya _h_ ) sabhayam anyasam aprave _s_ at,' comm. on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh.\nS., --? because no other (Apsaras) but these come to his court.\n\n[366:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_949) The _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. has 'let him recite the Ghora'--\nwhich the commentator again takes to be the title of a special work of the\nAtharvans--whilst the \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. reads 'let him recite some approved ghora\n(magic spell or operation).'\n\n[367:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_950) 'Arbuda _h_ Kadraveyo ra _g_ ety aheti _s_ rute\n_h_ (thus also on the name of the next king),' comm. on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S.\n\n[367:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_951) Lit. '(men) knowing about snakes'--which the\ncomm. on \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. explains by 'those knowing the Ka _s_ yapiya and other\ntreatises (tantra) on venoms.' Instead of the conjunctive double ' _k_ a,' the\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. has a single 'va'--the snakes, or (rather) snake-charmers--and \xc3\x82\n_s_ v. S. an explanatory 'iti'--the snakes, i.e. snake-charmers.\n\n[367:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_952) The _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. has, 'let hire recite the\nSarpavidya' (i.e. either the Garu _d_ a or Ka\xe1\xb9\x85kaniya sarpavidya, as the comm.\nexplains); the \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. 'let him recite the Vishavidya (science of\nvenoms).'\n\n[367:4](sbe44104.htm#fr_953) The etymology and exact meaning of 'selaga' is\ndoubtful:--here, again, whilst 'papak _ri_ ta _h_ ' is added either\nappositionally, or attributively (wicked selagas), the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. adds it by\nmeans of 'va,' and the \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. by 'iti'--both apparently meant in an\nexplanatory sense. The Ait. Br., on the other hand, has VII, 1, 'selaga va\npapak _ri_ to va;' and VIII, 11, 'nishada va selaga va papak _ri_ to va.' The\ncomm. on \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. explains 'selaga' by 'maddened by a snake;' the comm. on\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. by 'selaga _h_ se _n_ yagayanya _h_ (?) papak _ri_ to va mle _kh_\na _h_.'\n\n[368:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_954) That is, the science, or knowledge of the divine\n(or supernatural) beings. The _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. has, 'the Rakshovidya is the Veda,\n. . . let him recite the Rakshovidya'--on which the commentator remarks\n'prasiddhaiva kuhukurupa rakshovidyeti.' (? = 'kuhakarupa,' cheats, or\ndeceitful imps). \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. has 'yat ki _m_ _k_ it pi _s_ a _k_ asa _m_ yukta\n_m_ ni _s_ antam,' 'some approved (spell or operation?) connected with the Pi\n_s_ a _k_ as, or demons.'\n\n[368:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_955) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. has 'Asita Dhanvana.'\n\n[368:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_956) The two Sutras read 'Asuravidya'--asuravidyendra\n_g_ aladina tannirde _s_ an mayam api ka _m_ _k_ it kuryad a\xe1\xb9\x85gulinyasarupam\n('a trick by sleight of hand,' M. Muller), comm. on Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S. On 'indra _g_\nalavidya' ('magic art, trickery'), cf. Da _s_ akum., p. 25, 1. 12. The\nassociation of the black art with the usurer or money-lender (kusidin) is\nrather curious.\n\n[369:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_957) 'Matsya _h_ Sammada ity ash _t_ ame, Matsya _h_\nSammado ra _g_ eti _s_ rute _h_ pratikagraha _n_ am etat,' comm. on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh.\nS.\n\n[369:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_958) ' _G_ atisambandhena matsyavido va, mainikan pa\n_th_ inadivi _s_ eshavikalpan vidanti ye tan va,' comm. on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S.\n\n[369:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_962) Regarding the Itihasa (cosmogonic account) and\nPura _n_ a (ancient legend), see [p. 98](sbe44030.htm#page_98), note\n[4](sbe44030.htm#fn_317). The \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. connects the Itihasa with the ninth,\nand the Pura _n_ a with the eighth day. 'Itihasam a _k_ akshita,\nitihasavedasya p _ri_ thagbhavena dar _s_ a _n_ at,' comm. on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S.\n\n[369:4](sbe44104.htm#fr_960) \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. has Tarkshya Vaipa _s_ _k_\nita.--'Tarkshyo Vaipa _s_ yato ra _g_ ety aheti pratika( _m_ ) _s_ rute _h_ ,'\ncomm. on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S.\n\n[369:5](sbe44104.htm#fr_961) Lit., men acquainted with the science of birds\n(vayovidyika). The two Sutras, on the other hand, here identify the birds with\n'brahma _k_ ari _n_ a _h_ ,' or religious students.\n\n[369:6](sbe44104.htm#fr_963) According to the comm. on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S., it is the\nVayupura _n_ a (pura _n_ a _m_ vayuproktam) that is to be recited (from), and\nnot the hymn _Ri_ g-veda X, 130 ('tasya vedaikade _s_ atvat'). This hymn is\nprobably referred to in this connection chiefly on account of the passage 'ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e _g_ ate pura _n_ e' in verse 6.\n\n[370:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_964) 'Dharma Indra iti da _s_ ame, Dharma Indro ra _g_\nety aheti _S_ atapathe pratikadar _s_ anat,' comm. on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S.\n\n[370:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_965) The two Sutras still further qualify them as\n'young _s_ rotriyas who accept no gifts,' 'manu(shya)deva hi ta ity\nabhiprayat,' comm. on _S_ aab.; cp. _S_ at. Br. II, 2, 2, 6, 'ye brahma _n_ a\n_h_ _s_ u _s_ ruva _m_ so\xe0\xa4\xbdnu _k_ anas te manushyadeva _h_.'\n\n[370:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_966) The text has 'bruyat,' 'let him say;' whilst the\ntwo Sutras read 'sama gayat,' 'let him sing a Saman' ('yat ki _m_ _k_ id\nanindyam eva _s_ vamedhika _m_ va prakara _n_ at,' comm. on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. S.).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 4, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe44105.htm)\n\n"
