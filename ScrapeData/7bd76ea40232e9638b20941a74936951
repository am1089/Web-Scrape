(On account of the scriptural declarations) of (the soul's) passing out,\ngoing and returning, (the soul is of atomic size).\n\nWe now have to consider of what size the soul is, whether of atomic size or of\na medium size, or of great (infinite) size.--But, it has been shown above that\nthe soul is not a product and that eternal intelligence constitutes its\nnature, whence it follows that it is identical with the highest Self. Now the\ninfinity of the highest Self is clearly stated in scripture; what need then is\nthere of a discussion of the soul's size?--True, we reply; but certain\nscriptural passages which speak of the soul's passing out, going and\nreturning, establish the prima facie view that the soul is of limited size,\nand moreover in some places scripture expressly declares it to be of atomic\nsize. The present discussion is therefore begun for the purpose of clearing up\nthis doubtful point.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that, on account of its being said to pass out, go\nand return, the soul must be held to be of limited, atomic size. Its passing\nout is mentioned (Kau. Up. III, 3), 'And when he passes out of this body he\npasses out together with all these;' its going (Kau. Up. I, 3), 'All who\ndepart from this world go to the moon;' its returning (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 6),\n'From that world he returns again to this world of action.' From these\nstatements as to the soul's passing out, going and returning it follows that\nit is of limited size. For motion is impossible in the case of an all-\npervading being. And a limited size being once admitted, we have to conclude\nmore especially that the size is atomic, since the hypothesis\n\np. 36\n\nof the soul being of the same size as the body has already been refuted in our\nexamination of the \xc3\x82rhata-system.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 20](sbe38021.htm)\n\n"
