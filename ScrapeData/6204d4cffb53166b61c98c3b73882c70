One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, "You can hunt\nwherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the fourth\nside." This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth side he would\nhear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he would leave his father\nand mother and seek for the princess.\n\nThe young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time; but one\nday, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go, he\nremembered what she had said to him about the fourth side, and he determined\nto go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side. When be got\nthere, he found himself in a jungle, and nothing in the jungle but a quantity\nof parrots, who, lived in it. The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once\nthey all flew away up to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their\nRaja, who was called Hiraman parrot.\n\nWhen Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the other\nparrots, "Don\'t fly away and leave me alone when the Raja\'s son shoots. If you\ndesert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam."\n\nThen the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince was\ngreatly surprised, and said, "Why, these birds can talk!" Then he said to the\nparrots, "Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?" But the parrots\nwould not tell him where she lived. "You can never get to the Princess Labam\'s\ncountry." That is all they would say.\n\nThe prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more; and he\nthrew his gun away and went home. When he got home, he would not speak or eat,\nbut lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed very ill.\n\nAt last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the\nPrincess Labam. "I must go," be said; "I must see what she is like. Tell me\nwhere her country is."\n\n"We do not know where it is," answered his father and mother.\n\n"Then I must go and look for it," said the prince.\n\n"No, no," they said, "you must not leave us. You are our only son. Stay with\nus. You will never find the Princess Labam."\n\n" I must try and find her," said the prince. "Perhaps God will show me the\nway. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but perhaps I shall\ndie, and then I shall never see you again. Still I must go."\n\nSo they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with him.\nHis father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And he took his\ngun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other weapons; "for," he said,\n"I may want them." His father too, gave him plenty of rupees.\n\nThen he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said goodbye\nto his father and mother; and his mother took her handkerchief and wrapped\nsome sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her son. "My child," she said to him,\n"when you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats."\n\nHe then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a jungle in\nwhich were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his horse in the\ntank, and then sat down under a tree. "Now," he said to himself, "I will eat\nsome of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I will drink some \'water, and\nthen I will continue my journey." He opened his handkerchief and took out a\nsweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He took out another. There was an ant in\nthat one too. So he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out\nanother, and another, and another, until he had taken them all out; but in,\neach he found an ant. "Never mind," he said, "I won\'t eat the sweetmeats; the\nants shall eat them." Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said,\n"You have been good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will\ncome to you."\n\nThe Raja\'s son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his journey. He\nrode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there he saw a tiger who\nhad a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly from the pain.\n\n"Why do you roar like that?\' said the young Raja. "What is the matter with\nyou?"\n\n"I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years," answered the tiger, "and it\nhurts me so; that is why I roar."\n\n"Well," said the Raja\'s son, "I will take it out for you. But perhaps, as you\nare a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat me?"\n\n"Oh no," said the tiger, "I won\'t eat you. Do make me well."\n\n![](img/09.jpg)\n\nThen the prince took a little knife from his pocket and cut the thorn out of\nthe tiger\'s foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than ever--so loud\nthat his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came bounding along to see\nwhat was the matter. The tiger saw her coming, and hid the prince in the\njungle, so that she should not see him.\n\n"What man hurt you that you roared so loud?" said the wife.\n\n"No one hurt me," answered the husband; "but a Raja\'s son came and took the\nthorn out of my foot."\n\n"Where is he? Show him to me," said his wife.\n\n"If you promise not to kill him, I will call him," said the tiger.\n\n"I won\'t kill him; only let me see him," answered his wife.\n\n![](img/10.jpg)\n\nThen the tiger called the Raja\'s son, and when he came the tiger and his wife\nmade him a great many salaams. Then they gave him a good dinner, and he stayed\nwith them for three days. Every day he looked at the tiger\'s foot, and the\nthird day it was quite healed. Then he said good-bye to the tigers, and the\ntiger said to him, "If ever you are in trouble, think of me, and we will come\nto you."\n\nThe Raja\'s son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. Here he found\nfour fakirs whose teacher and master had died, and had left four things,--a\nbed, which carried whoever sat on it whithersoever he wished to go; a bag,\nthat gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels, food or clothes; a stone bowl\nthat gave its owner as much water as he wanted, no matter how far he might be\nfrom a tank; and a stick and rope, to which its owner had only to say, if any\none came to make war on him, "Stick, beat as many men and soldiers as are\nhere," and the stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up.\n\nThe four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things. One said, "I want\nthis;" another said,." You cannot have it, for I want it;" and so on.\n\nThe Raja\'s son said to them, "Do not quarrel for these things. I will shoot\nfour arrows in four different directions. Whichever of you gets to my first\narrow, shall have the first thing--the bed. Whosoever gets to the second\narrow, shall have the second thing--the bag. He who gets to the third arrow,\nshall have the third thing--the bowl. And he who gets to the fourth arrow,\nshall have the last things--the stick and rope." To this they agreed. And the\nprince shot off his first arrow. Away raced the fakirs to get it. When they\nbrought it back to him he shot off the second, and when they had found and\nbrought it to him he shot off his third, and when they had brought him the\nthird he shot off the fourth.\n\nWhile they were away looking for the fourth arrow the Raja\'s son let his horse\nloose in the jungle and sat on the bed, taking the bowl, the stick and rope,\nand the bag with him. Then he said, "Bed, I wish to go to the Princess Labam\'s\ncountry." The little bed instantly rose up into the air and began to fly, and\nit flew and flew till it came to the Princess Labam\'s country, where it\nsettled on the ground. The Raja\'s son asked some men he saw, "Whose country is\nthis?"\n\n"The Princess Labam\'s country," they answered. Then the prince went on till he\ncame to a house where he saw an old woman.\n\n"Who are you? "she said. "Where do you come from?"\n\n"I come from a far country," he said; "do let me stay with you to-night."\n\n"No," she answered, "I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has ordered\nthat men from other countries may not stay in his country. You cannot stay in\nmy house."\n\n"You are my aunty," said the prince; "let me remain with you for this one\nnight. You see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then the wild\nbeasts will eat me."\n\n"Well," said the old woman, "you may stay here tonight; but to-morrow morning\nyou must go away, for if the king hears you have passed the night in my house,\nhe will have me seized and put into prison."\n\nThen she took him into her house, and the Raja\'s son was very glad. The old\nwoman began preparing dinner, but he stopped her. "Aunty," he said, " I will\ngive you food." He put his hand into his bag, saying, "Bag, I want some\ndinner," and the. bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner, served up on two\ngold plates. The old woman and the Raja\'s son then dined together.\n\nWhen they had finished eating, \'the old woman said, "Now I will fetch some\nwater."\n\n"Don\'t go," said the prince. "You shall have plenty of water directly." So he\ntook his bowl and said to it, "Bowl, I want some water," and then it filled\nwith water. When it was full, the prince cried out, "Stop, bowl!" and the bowl\nstopped filling. "See, aunty," he said, "with this bowl I can always get as\nmuch water as I want."\n\nBy this time night had come. "Aunty," said the Raja\'s son, "why don\'t you\nlight a lamp?"\n\n"There is no need," she said. "Our king has forbidden the people in his\ncountry to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his daughter, the\nPrincess Labam, comes and sits on her roof, and she shines so that she lights\nup all the country and our houses, and we can see to do our work as if it were\nday."\n\nWhen it was quite black night the princess got up. She dressed herself in her\nrich clothes and jewels, and rolled up her hair, and across her head she put a\nband of diamonds and pearls. Then she shone like the moon and her beauty made\nnight day. She came out of her room and sat on the roof of her palace. In the\ndaytime she never came out of her house; she only came out at night. All the\npeople in her father\'s country then went about their work and finished it.\n\nThe Raja\'s son watched the princess quietly, and was very happy. He said to\nhimself, " How lovely she is!"\n\nAt midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down from her\nroof and went to her room; and when she was in bed and asleep, the Raja\'s son\ngot up softly and sat on his bed. "Bed," he said to it, "I want to go to the\nPrincess Labam\'s bed-room." So the little bed carried him to the room where\nshe lay fast asleep.\n\nThe young Raja took his bag and said, "I want a great deal of betel-leaf," and\nit at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf. This he laid near the princess\'s\nbed, and then his little bed carried him back to the old woman\'s house.\n\nNext morning all the princess\'s servants found the betel-leaf, and began to\neat it.\n\n"Where did you get all that betel-leaf?" asked the princess.\n\n"We found it near your bed," answered the servants. Nobody knew the prince had\ncome in the night and put it all there.\n\nIn the morning the old woman came to the Raja\'s son. "Now it is morning," she\nsaid, "and you must go; for if the king finds out all I have done for you, he\nwill seize me."\n\n"I am ill to-day, dear aunty," said the prince; "do let me stay till to-morrow\nmorning."\n\n"Good," said the old woman. So he stayed, and they took their dinner out of\nthe bag, and the bowl gave them water.\n\nWhen night came the princess got up and sat on her roof, and at twelve\no\'clock, when every one was in bed, she went to her bed-room, and was soon\nfast asleep. Then the Raja\'s son sat on his bed, and it carried him to the\nprincess. He took his bag and said, "Bag, I want a most lovely shawl;" It gave\nhim a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the princess as she lay asleep.\nThen he went back to the old woman\'s house and slept till morning.\n\nIn the morning, when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted. "See,\nmother," she said; "Khuda must have given me this shawl, it is so beautiful."\nHer mother was very glad too.   "Yes, my child," she said; "Khuda must have\ngiven you this splendid shawl."\n\nWhen it was morning the old woman said to the Raja\'s son, "Now you must really\ngo."\n\n"Aunty," he answered, "I am not well enough yet. Let me stay a few days\nlonger. I will remain hidden in your house, so that no one may see me." So the\nold woman let him stay.\n\nWhen it was black night, the princess put on her lovely. clothes and jewels\nand sat on her roof. At midnight she went to her room and went to sleep. Then\nthe Raja\'s son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room. There he said to his\nbag, "Bag, I want a very, very beautiful ring." The bag gave him a glorious\nring. Then he took the Princess Labam\'s hand gently to put on the ring, and\nshe started up very much frightened.\n\n"Who are you?" she said to the prince. "Where do you come from? Why do you\ncome to my room?"\n\n"Do not be afraid, princess," he said; "I am no thief. I am a great Raja\'s\nson. Hiraman parrot, who lives in the jungle where I went to hunt, told me\nyour name, and then I left my father and mother and came to see you."\n\n"Well," said the princess, "as you are the son of such a great kaja, I will\nnot have you killed, and I will tell my father and mother that I wish to marry\nyou."\n\nThe prince then returned to the old woman\'s house; and when morning came the\nprincess said to her mother, "The son of a great Raja has come to this\ncountry, and I wish to marry him." Her mother told this to the king.\n\n"Good," said the king; "but if this Raja\'s son wishes to marry my daughter, he\nmust first do whatever I bid him. If he fails I will kill him. I will give him\neighty pounds weight of mustard seed, and out of this he must crush the oil in\none day. If he cannot do this he shall die."\n\nIn the morning the Raja\'s son told the old woman that he intended to marry the\nprincess. "Oh," said the old woman, "go away from this country, and do not\nthink of marrying her. A great many Rajas and Rajas\' sons have come here to\nmarry her, and her father has had them all killed. He says whoever wishes to\nmarry his daughter must first do whatever he bids him. If he can, then he\nshall marry the princess; if he cannot, the king will have him killed. But no\none can do the things the king tells him to do; so all the Rajas and Rajas\'\nsons who have tried have been put to death. You will be killed too, if you\ntry. Do go away." But the prince would not listen to anything she said.\n\nThe king sent for the prince to the old woman\'s. house, and his servants\nbrought the Raja\'s son to the king\'s courthouse to the king. There the king\ngave him eighty pounds of mustard seed, and told him to crush all the oil out\nof it that day, and bring it next morning to him to the courthouse. "Whoever\nwishes to marry my daughter." he said to the prince, "must first do all I tell\nhim. If he cannot, then I have him killed. So if you cannot crush all the oil\nout of this mustard seed you will die."\n\nThe prince was very sorry when he heard this. "How can I crush the oil out of\nall this mustard seed in one thy?" he said to himself; "and if I do not, the\nking will kill me." He took the mustard seed to the old woman\'s house, and did\nnot know what to do. At last he remembered the Ant-Raja, and the moment he did\nso, the Ant-Raja and his ants came to him. "Why do you look so sad?" said the\nAnt-Raja.\n\nThe prince showed him the mustard seed, and said to him, "How can I crush the\noil out of all this mustard seed in one day? And if I do not take the oil to\nthe king to-morrow morning, he will kill me."\n\n"Be happy," said the Ant-Raja; "lie down and sleep; we will crush all the oil\nout for you during the day, and to-morrow morning you shall take it to the\nking." The Raja\'s son lay down and slept, and the ants crushed out the oil for\nhim. The prince was very glad when he saw the oil.\n\nThe next morning he took it to the court-house to the king. But the king\nsaid," You cannot yet marry my daughter. If you wish to do so, you must first\nfight with my two demons, and kill them." The king a long time ago had caught\ntwo demons, and then, as he did not know what to do with them, he had shut\nthem up in a cage. He was afraid to let them loose for fear they would eat up\nall the people in his country; and he did not know how to kill them. So all\nthe kings and kings\' sons who wanted to marry the Princess Labam had to fight\nwith these demons; "for," said the king to himself, "perhaps the demons may be\nkilled, and then I shall be rid of them."\n\nWhen he heard of the demons the Raja\'s son was very sad. "What can I do?" he\nsaid to himself. "How can I fight with these two demons?" Then he thought of\nhis tiger: and the tiger and his wife came to him and said, "Why are you so\nsad?" The Raja\'s son answered, "The king has ordered me to fight with his two\ndemons and kill them. How can I do this? " "Do not be frightened," said the\ntiger. "Be happy. I and my wife will fight with them for you."\n\nThen the Raja\'s son took out of his bag two splendid coats. They were all gold\nand silver, and covered with pearls and diamonds. These he put on the tigers\nto make them beautiful, and he took them to the king, and said to him,. "May\nthese tigers fight your demons for me?"\n\n"Yes," said\' the king, who did not care in the least who killed his demons,\nprovided they were killed. "Then call your demons," said the Raja\'s son, "and\nthese tigers will fight them." The king did so, and the tigers and the demons\nfought and fought until the tigers had killed the demons.\n\n![](img/11.jpg)\n\n"That is good," said the king. "But you must do something else before I give\nyou my daughter. Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum. You must go and beat it.\nIf you cannot do this, I will kill you."\n\nThe Raja\'s son thought of his little bed; so he went to the old woman\'s house\nand sat on his bed. "Little bed!\' he said, "up in the sky is the king\'s\nkettle-drum. I want to go to it." The bed flew up with him, and the Raja\'s son\nbeat the drum, and the king heard him. Still, when he came down, the king\nwould not give him his daughter. "You have," he said to the prince, "done the\nthree things I told you to do; but you must do one thing more."\n\n"If I can, I will," said the Raja\'s son.\n\nThen the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his court-\nhouse. It was a very, very, thick trunk. He gave the prince a wax hatchet, and\nsaid, "Tomorrow morning you must cut this trunk in two with this wax hatchet."\n\nThe Raja\'s son went back to the old woman\'s house. He was very sad, and\nthought that now the Raja would certainly kill him. "I had his oil crushed out\nby the ants," he said to himself. "I had his demons killed by the tigers. My\nbed helped me to beat his kettle-drum. But now what can I do? How can I cut\nthat thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet?"\n\nAt night he went on his bed to see the princess. "To morrow," he said to her,\n"your father will kill me." "Why?" asked the princess.\n\n"He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet. How can I\never do that?" said the Raja\'s son. "Do not be afraid," said the princess; "do\nas I bid you, and you will cut it in two quite easily."\n\nThen she pulled out a hair from her head and gave it to the prince. "To-\nmorrow," she said, "when no one is near you, you must say to the tree-trunk,\n\'The Princess Labam commands you to let yourself be cut in two by this hair.\nThen stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet\'s blade."\n\nThe prince next day did exactly as the princess had told him; and the minute\nthe hair that was stretched down the edge of the hatchet-blade touched the\ntree-trunk it split into two pieces.\n\nThe king said, "Now you can marry my daughter." Then the wedding took place.\nAll the Rajas and kings of the countries round were asked to come to it, and\nthere were great rejoicings. After a few days the prince\'s son said to his\nwife, "Let us go to my father\'s country." The Princess Labam\'s father gave\nthem a quantity of camels and horses and rupees and servants; and they\ntravelled in great state to the prince\'s country, where they lived happily.\n\nThe prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only, as no one ever\ncame to make war on him, he never needed to use the stick.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Lambikin](ift04.htm)\n\n'
