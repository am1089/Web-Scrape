'There are the two 1, drinking their reward in the world of their own\nworks, entered into the cave (of the heart), dwelling on the highest summit\n(the ether in the heart). Those who know Brahman call them shade and light;\nlikewise, those householders who perform the Tri _n_ a _k_ iketa sacrifice.'\n\n2\\. 'May we be able to master that Na _k_ iketa rite which is a bridge for\nsacrificers; also that which is the highest, imperishable Brahman for those\nwho wish to cross over to the fearless shore 2.'\n\n3\\. 'Know the Self to be sitting in the chariot, the body to be the chariot,\nthe intellect (buddhi) the charioteer, and the mind the reins 3.'\n\n4\\. 'The senses they call the horses, the objects of the senses their roads.\nWhen he (the Highest Self) is in union with the body, the senses, and the\nmind, then wise people call him the Enjoyer.'\n\n5\\. 'He who has no understanding and whose mind\n\np. 13\n\n[paragraph continues] (the reins) is never firmly held, his senses (horses)\nare unmanageable, like vicious horses of a charioteer.'\n\n6\\. 'But he who has understanding and whose mind is always firmly held, his\nsenses are under control, like good horses of a charioteer.'\n\n7\\. 'He who has no understanding, who is unmindful and always impure, never\nreaches that place, but enters into the round of births.'\n\n8\\. 'But he who has understanding, who is mindful and always pure, reaches\nindeed that place, from whence he is not born again.'\n\n9\\. 'But he who has understanding for his charioteer, and who holds the reins\nof the mind, he reaches the end of his journey, and that is the highest place\nof Vish _n_ u.'\n\n10\\. 'Beyond the senses there are the objects, beyond the objects there is the\nmind, beyond the mind there is the intellect, the Great Self is beyond the\nintellect.'\n\n11\\. 'Beyond the Great there is the Undeveloped, beyond the Undeveloped there\nis the Person (purusha). Beyond the Person there is nothing--this is the goal,\nthe highest road.'\n\n12\\. 'That Self is hidden in all beings and does not shine forth, but it is\nseen by subtle seers through their sharp and subtle intellect.'\n\n13\\. 'A wise man should keep down speech and mind 1; he should keep them\nwithin the Self which is knowledge; he should keep knowledge within the Self\nwhich is the Great; and he should keep that (the Great) within the Self which\nis the Quiet.'\n\n14\\. 'Rise, awake! having obtained your boons 2,\n\np. 14\n\nunderstand them! The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the\nwise say the path (to the Self) is hard.'\n\n15\\. 'He who has perceived that which is without sound, without touch, without\nform, without decay, without taste, eternal, without smell, without beginning,\nwithout end, beyond the Great, and unchangeable, is freed from the jaws of\ndeath.'\n\n16\\. 'A wise man who has repeated or heard the ancient story of Na _k_ iketas\ntold by Death, is magnified in the world of Brahman.'\n\n17\\. 'And he who repeats this greatest mystery in an assembly of Brahmans, or\nfull of devotion at the time of the _S_ raddha sacrifice, obtains thereby\ninfinite rewards.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[12:1](sbe15012.htm#fr_114) The two are explained as the higher and lower\nBrahman, the former being the light, the latter the shadow. _Ri_ ta is\nexplained as reward, and connected with suk _ri_ ta, lit. good deeds, but\nfrequently used in the sense of svak _ri_ ta, one's own good and evil deeds.\nThe difficulty is, how the highest Brahman can be said to drink the reward (\n_ri_ tapa) of former deeds, as it is above all works and above all rewards.\nThe commentator explains it away as a metaphorical expression, as we often\nspeak of many, when we mean one. (Cf. Mu _n_ _d_. Up. III, 1, 1.) I have\njoined suk _ri_ tasya with loke, loka meaning the world, i.e. the state, the\nenvironment, which we made to ourselves by our former deeds.\n\n[12:2](sbe15012.htm#fr_115) These two verses may be later additions.\n\n[12:3](sbe15012.htm#fr_116) The simile of the chariot has some points of\nsimilarity with the well-known passage in Plato's Phaedros, but Plato did not\nborrow this simile from the Brahmans, as little as Xenophon need have\nconsulted our Upanishad (II, 2) in writing his prologue of Prodikos.\n\n[13:1](sbe15012.htm#fr_117) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara interprets, he should keep down speech\nin the mind.\n\n[13:2](sbe15012.htm#fr_118) Comm., excellent teachers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4](sbe15013.htm)\n\n"
