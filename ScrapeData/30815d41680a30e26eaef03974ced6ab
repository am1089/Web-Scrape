And there is another one (i.e. the Lord who is different from the\nindividual souls animating the sun, &c.), on account of the declaration of\ndistinction.\n\nThere is, moreover, one distinct from the individual souls which animate the\nsun and other bodies, viz. the Lord who rules within; whose distinction (from\nall individual souls) is proclaimed in the following scriptural passage, 'He\nwho dwells in the sun and within the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose\nbody the sun is, and who rules the sun within; he is thy Self, the ruler\nwithin, the immortal' (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 9). Here the expression, 'He within\nthe sun whom the sun does not know,' clearly indicates that the Ruler within\nis distinct from that cognising individual soul whose body is the sun. With\nthat Ruler within we have to identify the person within the sun, according to\nthe tenet of the sameness of purport of all Vedanta-texts. It thus remains a\nsettled conclusion that the passage under discussion conveys instruction about\nthe highest Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 22](sbe34028.htm)\n\n"
