He recites the Va _s_ a hymn 1, wishing, May everything be in my power.\n\n2\\. They (its verses) are twenty-one 2, for twenty-one are the parts (the\nlungs, spleen, &c.) in the belly.\n\n3\\. Then the Ekavi _m_ sa is verily the support of all Stomas, and the belly\nthe support of all food.\n\n4\\. They consist of different metres. Verily, the intestines are confused,\nsome small, some large.\n\n5\\. He recites them with the pra _n_ ava 3, according to the metre 4, and\naccording to rule 5. Verily, the intestines are according to rule, as it were;\nsome shorter, some longer.\n\n6\\. Next comes the Sudadohas verse. Sudadohas verily is breath. He joins the\njoints; with breath.\n\n7\\. After having recited that verse twelve times he\n\np. 194\n\nleaves it off there. These pra _n_ as are verily twelvefold, seven in the\nhead, two on the breast, three below. In these twelve places the pra _n_ as\nare contained, there they are perfect. Therefore he leaves it off there\n[1](sbe01200.htm#fn_480).\n\n8\\. The hymn indragni yuva _m_ su nah (Rv. VIII, 40) forms the two thighs (of\nthe bird) belonging to Indra and Agni, the two supports with broad bones.\n\n9\\. These (verses) consist of six feet, so that they may stand firm. Man\nstands firm on two feet, animals on four. He thus places man (the sacrificer),\nstanding on two feet, among four-footed cattle.\n\n10\\. The second verse has seven feet, and he makes it into a Gayatri and Anush\n_t_ ubh. Gayatri is Brahman, Anush _t_ ubh is speech; and he thus puts\ntogether speech with Brahman.\n\n11\\. He recites a Trish _t_ ubh at the end. Trish _t_ ubh is strength, and\nthus does he come round animals by strength. Therefore animals come near where\nthere is strength (of command, &c.); they come to be roused and to rise up,\n(they obey the commands of a strong shepherd.)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[193:1](sbe01199.htm#fr_477) Having recited the verses which form the body,\nneck, head, wings, and tail of the bird, also the food intended for the bird,\nhe now describes the Va _s_ a hymn, i.e. the hymn composed by Va _s_ a, Rv.\nVIII, 46. That hymn takes the place of the stomach which receives the food\nintended for the bird. Cf. Ait. \xc3\x82r. V, 2, 5. In I, 5, 2, 4 it is called a\nNivid.\n\n[193:2](sbe01199.htm#fr_478) Verses 1-20 of the Vasa hymn, and one Sudadohas.\n\n[193:3](sbe01199.htm#fr_479) Pra _n_ avam means 'with pra _n_ ava,' i.e.\ninserting Om in the proper places.\n\n[193:4](sbe01199.htm#fr_480) According as the metres of the different verses\nare fixed by _S_ aunaka, Ait. \xc3\x82r. V, 2, 5, who says that verse 15 is Dvipada,\nand that the last four words, nunam atha, form an Ekapada.\n\n[193:5](sbe01199.htm#fr_481) According to rule, i.e. so that they should come\nright as \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana has prescribed the recitation of Dvipada and Ekapada\nverses. In a Dvipada there should be a stop after the first foot, and Om at\nthe end o f the second. Ira an Ekapada there should be Om at the beginning and\nat the end.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 5, 2](sbe01200.htm)\n\n"
