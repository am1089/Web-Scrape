We think clearly and continuously--not of Egypt, Judaea, Syria, Greece,\nItaly, Spain and Africa--but of Memphis, Thebes, Jerusalem, Tyre, Damascus,\nEphesus, Athens, Rome, Carthage, and it may be a score or two of others. The\nstate appears in our minds as merely a vague hinterlandlike appanage of the\ncity thus conceived. Nor can we fail to see the influence which the pursuit of\ncivic ideals has had upon the religious conceptions both of Judaism and of the\nChristianity which succeeds it.\n\nIt strikes upon an Indian ear as somewhat strange that the Jew should be able,\nin such good faith, to denote so much as he does simply by the use of the name\nof a municipality. "Send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee\n\np. 98\n\nout of Zion." We should find it difficult to say; "Send thee help from the\nsanctuary, and strengthen thee out of--Indraprastha," for instance. And yet\nwhy? But so deep was the habit of thought with the Jew that he has been able,\nthrough his incomparable literature, to stamp with a like vividness the names\nof many cities even outside Palestine proper, so that Babylon, Nineveh, and\nDamascus call up to this day certain larger than civic attributes which he,\nmore or less justly, associated with them. It was natural enough, then, that a\nJudaic apostle should delineate Heaven as the New Jerusalem, that beloved city\nof his race. And it was in accordance with the ancestry of the Faith that the\ndreamers of the European Middle Ages should constantly present us with a\nParadise that resembles a city or township much more closely than a country or\na fatherland. Even Dante and Giotto, in spite of the enormous grasp of their\nminds, were both civic dreamers, and it seemed natural to them that Beatrice\nshould shine as fair in Heaven as she shone in Florence.\n\nThe cursory reader might regard it as a foregone conclusion that such civic\npassion as this was never known in India. For even Benares--which resembles\nJerusalem in being a sacred city of no less than three religions--even Benares\nis more strictly national than civic in its character. Every\n\np. 99\n\nstate in India had built a palace within the sacred area. Every religion\npossesses there a cathedral, and its charities from the municipal point of\nview are apt to fail. Colleges of Sanskrit learning, almonries of daily doles\nfor pilgrims and poor students; monasteries filled with devotees--all these do\nnot suffice for the needs of the city from that purely territorial point of\nview which is the civic spirit proper, and the evolution of charities having\nthis aim has been left for modern times. And yet, there have in all ages been\ngreat and resonant names in India that should give us pause ere we venture to\narrive at the sweeping conclusion that civic passion is foreign to the Indian\nspirit. What about Chitore, that rock-built crown of the Rajput deserts? What\nabout Delhi, Amritsar, Poona, Conjeeveram, and a hundred others? Yes, and one\nmore, one which stands revealed in this picture newly brought to Calcutta--\nwhat about Ayodhya?\n\nIt is a small picture, measuring not many inches either way. The colours are\nrich and mellow, in the old missal-like style of Indian painting, The\nforeground is filled with a scarf-like band of figures, painted for the most\npart in ginger-shades of orange and yellow. Behind riset he white marble walls\nand towers of Ayodhya, and beyond only a narrow strip of sky is seen above the\nhorizon.\n\np. 100\n\nTo those familiar with the Madonna and Child of Italian painters the figures\nin the front are easy to understand. Under the umbrella of state--which, by\nthe way, is decorated with real pearls, and suggests the _baldachino_ of Roman\nchurches--sit Sita and Rama on a double throne. In Rama\'s hand is an\nexquisitely decorative white lotus, reminiscent of the Annunciation lily of\nthe angelic messenger. On the right of the king stand his brothers, on the\nleft of the queen her ladies of honour, and Hanuman kneels at the feet of the\nroyal pair. The scene is laid in the gardens of Ayodhya. In the moat behind,\nbathers and a couple of elephants are seen, swimming and sporting in the\nwater, and the royal barge is shown in all its glory.\n\nBut it is on the snow-white buildings of Ayodhya that stretch from beyond the\nmoat into the blue that the artist has spent all his powers. Intending perhaps\nto delineate a palace, he has actually given us a city, filled with life and\nmotion and happiness. But it is the city of Paradise. No human scene, alas,\nwas ever poised so dream-like between earth and heaven. No human scene was\never so perfect, growing more and more distinct as we examine it closer and in\ngreater detail.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chitore](seh19.htm)\n\n'
