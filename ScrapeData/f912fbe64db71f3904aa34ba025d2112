Jets of wit and humour are\nbeing splashed about, and the lies thus scattered are convulsing the whole\ncountry. They know that the monopoly of mud-throwing is theirs, and the\ninnocent passerby cannot escape unsoiled.\n\nThey are saying that the residents in my estates, from the highest to the\nlowest, are in favour of _Swadeshi_ , but they dare not declare themselves,\nfor fear of me. The few who have been brave enough to defy me have felt the\nfull rigour of my persecution. I am in secret league with the police, and in\nprivate communication with the magistrate, and these frantic efforts of mine\nto add a foreign title of my own earning to the one I have inherited, will\nnot, it is opined, go in vain.\n\nOn the other hand, the papers are full of praise for those devoted sons of the\nmotherland, the Kundu and the Chakravarti _zamindars_. If only, say they, the\ncountry had a few more of such staunch patriots, the mills of Manchester would\nhave, had to sound their own dirge to the tune of _Bande Mataram_.\n\nThen comes a letter in blood-red ink, giving a list of the traitorous\n_zamindars_ whose treasuries have been burnt down because of their failing to\nsupport the Cause. Holy Fire, it goes on to say, has been aroused to its\nsacred function of purifying the country; and other agencies are also at work\nto see that those who are not true sons of the motherland do cease to encumber\nher lap. The signature is an obvious _nom-de-plume_.\n\nI could see that this was the doing of our local students. So I sent for some\nof them and showed them the letter.\n\nThe B.A. student gravely informed me that they also had heard that a band of\ndesperate patriots had been formed who would stick at nothing in order to\nclear away all obstacles to the success of _Swadeshi_.\n\n"If," said I, "even one of our countrymen succumbs to these overbearing\ndesperadoes, that will indeed be a defeat for the country!"\n\n"We fail to follow you, Maharaja," said the history student. "\'Our country," I\ntried to explain, "has been brought to death\'s door through sheer fear--from\nfear of the gods down to fear of the police; and if you set up, in the name of\nfreedom, the fear of some other bogey, whatever it may be called; if you would\nraise your victorious standard on the cowardice of the country by means of\ndownright oppression, then no true lover of the country can bow to your\ndecision."\n\n"Is there any country, sir," pursued the history student, "where submission to\nGovernment is not due to fear?"\n\n"The freedom that exists in any country," I replied, "may be measured by the\nextent of this reign of fear. Where its threat is confined to those who would\nhurt or plunder, there the Government may claim to have freed man from the\nviolence of man. But if fear is to regulate how people are to dress, where\nthey shall trade, or what they must eat, then is man\'s freedom of will utterly\nignored, and manhood destroyed at the root."\n\n"Is not such coercion of the individual will seen in other countries too?"\ncontinued the history student.\n\n"Who denies it?" I exclaimed. "But in every country man has destroyed himself\nto the extent that he has permitted slavery to flourish."\n\n"Does it not rather show," interposed a Master of Arts, "that trading in\nslavery is inherent in man--a fundamental fact of his nature?"\n\n"Sandip Babu made the whole thing clear," said a graduate. "He gave us the\nexample of Harish Kundu, your neighbouring _zamindar_. From his estates you\ncannot ferret out a single ounce of foreign salt. Why? Because he has always\nruled with an iron hand. In the case of those who are slaves by nature, the\nlack of a strong master is the greatest of all calamities."\n\n"Why, sir!" chimed in an undergraduate, "have you not heard of the\nobstreperous tenant of Chakravarti, the other _zamindar_ close by--how the law\nwas set on him till he was reduced to utter destitution? When at last he was\nleft with nothing to eat, he started out to sell his wife\'s silver ornaments,\nbut no one dared buy them. Then Chakravarti\'s manager offered him five rupees\nfor the lot. They were worth over thirty, but he had to accept or starve.\nAfter taking over the bundle from him the manager coolly said that those five\nrupees would be credited towards his rent! We felt like having nothing more to\ndo with Chakravarti or his manager after that, but Sandip Babu told us that if\nwe threw over all the live people, we should have only dead bodies from the\nburning-grounds to carry on the work with! These live men, he pointed out,\nknow what they want and how to get it--they are born rulers. Those who do not\nknow how to desire for themselves, must live in accordance with, or die by\nvirtue of, the desires of such as these. Sandip Babu contrasted them--Kundu\nand Chakravarti-- with you, Maharaja. You, he said, for all your good\nintentions, will never succeed in planting _Swadeshi_ within your territory."\n\n"It is my desire," I said, "to plant something greater than _Swadeshi_. I am\nnot after dead logs but living trees--and these will take time to grow."\n\n"I am afraid, sir," sneered the history student, "that you will get neither\nlog nor tree. Sandip Babu rightly teaches that in order to get, you must\nsnatch. This is taking all of us some time to learn, because it runs counter\nto what we were taught at school. I have seen with my own eyes that when a\nrent-collector of Harish Kundu\'s found one of the tenants with nothing which\ncould be sold up to pay his rent, he was made to sell his young wife! Buyers\nwere not wanting, and the _zamindar\'s_ demand was satisfied. I tell you, sir,\nthe sight of that man\'s distress prevented my getting sleep for nights\ntogether! But, feel it as I did, this much I realized, that the man who knows\nhow to get the money he is out for, even by selling up his debtor\'s wife, is a\nbetter man than I am. I confess it is beyond me--I am a weakling, my eyes fill\nwith tears. If anybody can save our country it is these Kundus and these\nChakravartis and their officials!"\n\nI was shocked beyond words. "If what you say be true," I cried, "I clearly see\nthat it must be the one endeavour of my life to save the country from these\nsame Kundus and Chakravartis and officials. The slavery that has entered into\nour very bones is breaking out, at this opportunity, as ghastly tyranny. You\nhave been so used to submit to domination through fear, you have come to\nbelieve that to make others submit is a kind of religion. My fight shall be\nagainst this weakness, this atrocious cruelty!" These things, which are so\nsimple to ordinary folk, get so twisted in the minds of our B.A.\'s and M.A.\'s,\nthe only purpose of whose historical quibbles seems to be to torture the\ntruth!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI](hw33.htm)\n\n'
