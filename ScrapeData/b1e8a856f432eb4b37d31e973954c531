The four castes are distinguished by their origin and by particular\nsacraments. 1\n\n2\\. There is also the following passage of the Veda, 'The Brahma _n_ a was his\nmouth, the Kshatriya formed his arms, the Vai _s_ ya his thighs; the _S_ udra\nwas born from his feet.' 2\n\n3\\. It has been declared in (the following passage\n\np. 26\n\nof) the Veda that (a _S_ udra) shall not receive the sacraments, 'He created\nthe Brahma _n_ a with the Gayatri (metre), the Kshatriya with the Trish _t_\nubh, the Vai _s_ ya with the _G_ agati, the _S_ udra without any metre.'\n\n4\\. Truthfulness, suppression of anger, liberality, abstention from injuring\nliving beings, and the procreation of offspring (are duties common to) all\n(castes). 4\n\n5\\. The Manava (Sutra states), 'Only when he worships the manes and the gods,\nor honours guests, he may certainly do injury to animals.' 5\n\n6\\. 'On offering a Madhuparka (to a guest), at a sacrifice, and at the rites\nin honour of the manes, but on these occasions only may an animal be slain;\nthat (rule) Manu proclaimed.' 6\n\np. 27\n\n7\\. 'Meat can never be obtained without injuring living beings, and to injure\nliving beings does not procure heavenly bliss; therefore the (sages declare)\nthe slaughter (of beasts) at a sacrifice not to be slaughter (in the ordinary\nsense of the word).' 7\n\n8\\. 'Now he may also cook a full-grown ox or a full-grown he-goat for a Brahma\n_n_ a or Kshatriya guest; in this manner they offer hospitality to such (a\nman).' 8\n\n9\\. Libations of water (must be poured out) for all (deceased relatives) who\ncompleted the second year and (their death causes) impurity.\n\n10\\. Some declare that (this rule applies also to children) that died after\nteething.\n\n11\\. After having burnt the body (of the deceased, the relatives) enter the\nwater without looking at (the place of cremation), 11\n\n12\\. Facing the south, they shall pour out water with both hands on (those\ndays of the period of impurity) which are marked by odd numbers. 12\n\np. 28\n\n13\\. The south, forsooth, is the region sacred to the manes.\n\n14\\. After they have gone home, they shall sit during three days on mats,\nfasting. 14\n\n15\\. If they are unable (to fast so long), they shall subsist on food bought\nin the market or given unasked. 15\n\n16\\. It is ordered that impurity caused by a death shall last ten days in the\ncase of Sapi _n_ _d_ a relations.\n\n17\\. It has been declared in the Veda that Sapi _n_ _d_ a relationship extends\nto the seventh person (in the ascending or descending line). 17\n\n18\\. It has been declared in the Veda that for married females it extends to\nthe third person (in the ascending or descending line).\n\n19\\. Others (than the blood-relations) shall perform (the obsequies) of\nmarried females, 19\n\n20\\. (The rule regarding impurity) should be exactly the same on the birth of\na child for those men who desire complete purity, 20\n\n21\\. Or for the mother and the father (of the child alone); some (declare that\nit applies) to the 21\n\np. 29\n\nmother (only), because she is the immediate cause of that (event).\n\n22\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): On the birth (of a child) the\nmale does not become impure if he does not touch (the female); on that\n(occasion) the menstrual excretion must be known to be impure, and that is not\nfound in males.'\n\n23\\. If during (a period of impurity) another (death or birth) happens, (the\nrelatives) shall be pure after (the expiration of) the remainder of that\n(first period); 23\n\n24\\. (But) if one night (and day only of the first period of impurity) remain,\n(they shall be pure) after two (days and nights); 24\n\n25\\. (If the second death or birth happens) on the morning (of the day on\nwhich the first period of impurity expires, they shall be purified) after\nthree (days and nights). 25\n\n26\\. A Brahma _n_ a is freed from impurity (caused by a death or a birth)\nafter ten days, 26\n\n27\\. A Kshatriya after fifteen days,\n\n28\\. A Vai _s_ ya after twenty days,\n\n29\\. A _S_ udra after a month. 29\n\n30\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'But (a twice-born man) who\nhas eaten (the food) of a _S_ udra during impurity caused by a death or a\n\np. 30\n\nbirth, will suffer dreadful (punishment in) hell and be born again in the womb\nof an animal.'\n\n31\\. 'A twice-born man who eats by appointment in the house of a stranger\nwhose ten days of impurity, caused by a death, have not expired, after death\nwill become a worm and feed on the ordure of that (man who fed him).'\n\n32\\. It has been declared in the Veda, '(Such a sinner) becomes pure by\nreciting the Sa _m_ hita of the Veda for twelve months or for twelve half-\nmonths while fasting.' 32\n\n33\\. On the death of a child of less than two years or on a miscarriage, the\nimpurity of the Sapi _n_ _d_ as lasts three (days and) nights. 33\n\n34\\. Gautama (declares that on the former occasion they become) pure at once.\n34\n\n35\\. If (a person) dies in a foreign country and (his Sapi _n_ _d_ as) hear\n(of his death) after ten days (or a longer period), the impurity lasts for one\n(day and) night.\n\n36\\. Gautama (declares that) if a person who has kindled the sacred fire dies\non a journey, (his Sapi _n_ _d_ as shall) again celebrate his obsequies,\n(burning a dummy made of leaves or straw), and remain impure (during ten days)\nas if (they had actually buried) his corpse. 36\n\n37\\. When he has touched a sacrificial post, a pyre, a burial-ground, a\nmenstruating or a lately confined woman, impure men or ( _K_ a _n_ _d_ alas\nand so forth), he shall bathe, submerging both his body and his head. 37\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[25:1](sbe1407.htm#fr_164) **IV**. Manu I, 87.\n\n[25:2](sbe1407.htm#fr_165) Rig-veda X, 90, 12.\n\n[26:4](sbe1407.htm#fr_166) Vish _n_ u II, 17.\n\n[26:5](sbe1407.htm#fr_167) Manavam, 'the Manava (Sutra),' means literally 'a\nwork proclaimed by Manu' (manuna proktam). It is probable that the work\nreferred to by Vasish _th_ a is the lost Dharma-sutra of the Manava _S_ akha,\nwhich is a subdivision of the Maitraya _n_ iyas, and on which the famous\nmetrical Manava Dharma _s_ astra is based. The words of the Sutra may either\nbe a direct quotation or a summary of the opinion given in the Manava-sutra. I\nthink the former supposition the more probable one, and believe that not only\nSutra 5, but also Sutras 6-8 have been taken bodily from the ancient Dharma-\nsutra. For Sutra 6 agrees literally with a verse of the metrical Manusm _ri_\nti, and at the end of Sutra 8 several MSS. have the word iti, the\ncharacteristic mark that a quotation is finished, while the language of Sutra\n8 is more antiquated than Vasish _th_ a's usual style. If my view is correct,\nit follows that the lost Manava Dharma-sutra consisted, like nearly all the\nknown works of this class, partly of prose and partly of verse.\n\n[26:6](sbe1407.htm#fr_168) Identical with Manu V, 41; Vish _n_ u LI, 64; and\nSa\xe1\xb9\x85khayana G _ri_ hya-sutra II, 16, 1. I take pi _t_ ridaivata, against\nKulluka's and K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita's view, as a bahuvrihi compound,\nand dissolve it by pitaro daivata _m_ ya _s_ mi _m_ stat, literally 'such (a\nrite) where the manes are the deities,' The other explanation, '(rites) p. 27\nto the manes or to the gods,' which is also grammatically correct, recommends\nitself less, because the rites to the gods are already included by the word ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e, 'at a sacrifice.' As to the Madhuparka, see \xc3\x82pastamba II, 4, 8,\n8-9, and below XI, 1.\n\n[27:7](sbe1407.htm#fr_169) Manu V, 48, and Vish _n_ u LI, 71, where, however,\nthe conclusion of the verse has been altered to suit the ahi _m_ sa-doctrines\nof the compilers of the metrical Sm _ri_ tis. The reason why slaughter at a\nsacrifice is not slaughter in the ordinary sense may be gathered from Vish _n_\nu LI, 61, 63.\n\n[27:8](sbe1407.htm#fr_170) _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a III, 4, I, 2; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya I, 109. 9-10. Vish _n_ u XIX, 7; Manu V, 58. Regarding the length of\nthe period of impurity, see below, Sutras 16, 26-29.\n\n[27:11](sbe1407.htm#fr_171) Vish _n_ u XIX, 6.\n\n[27:12](sbe1407.htm#fr_172) Vish _n_ u XIX, 7; Gautama XIV, 40. 'On those days\nof the period of impurity which are marked by odd numbers,' i.e. 'on the\nfirst, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth, as has been declared by Gautama.'--K\n_ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita.\n\n[28:14](sbe1407.htm#fr_173) Vish _n_ u XIX, 16; Gautama XIV, 37.\n\n[28:15](sbe1407.htm#fr_174) Vish _n_ u XIX, 14.\n\n[28:17](sbe1407.htm#fr_175) Vish _n_ u XXII, 5.\n\n[28:19](sbe1407.htm#fr_176) Gautama XIV, 36; Paraskara G _ri_ hya-sutra III,\nxo, 42. Others than the blood-relations,' i.e. 'the husband and his\nrelatives.' The MSS. have another Sutra following this, which K _ri_ sh _n_\napa _n_ _d_ ita leaves out. Ta _s_ _k_ a tesham, 'and they (the married\nfemales shall perform the obsequies) of those (i.e. their husbands and his\nSapi _n_ _d_ as).' It seems to me very probable that the passage is genuine,\nespecially as Paraskara, G _ri_ hya-sutra III, 10, 43, has the same words.\n\n[28:20](sbe1407.htm#fr_177) Vish _n_ u XXII, 1.\n\n[28:21](sbe1407.htm#fr_178) Gautama XIV, 15-16, The Sutra ought to have been\ndivided into two.\n\n[29:23](sbe1407.htm#fr_179) Vish _n_ u XXII, 35.\n\n[29:24](sbe1407.htm#fr_180) Vish _n_ u XXII, 36.\n\n[29:25](sbe1407.htm#fr_181) Vish _n_ u. XXII, 37. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_\nita explains prabhate, 'on the morning (of the day on which the first period\nof impurity expires),' in accordance with Nandapa _n_ _d_ ita's explanation of\nVish _n_ u's text by 'during the last watch (of the last night of the period\nof impurity).' See also the slightly different explanation of the identical\nswords by Haradatta, Gautama XIV, 8.\n\n[29:26](sbe1407.htm#fr_182) Vish _n_ u XXII, 1.\n\n[29:29](sbe1407.htm#fr_183) Vish _n_ u XXII, 4.\n\n[30:32](sbe1407.htm#fr_184) Regarding the penance prescribed here, the so-\ncalled ana _s_ natparaya _n_ a, see below XX, 46, and Baudhayana III, 9.\n\n[30:33](sbe1407.htm#fr_185) Vish _n_ u XXII, 27-30.\n\n[30:34](sbe1407.htm#fr_186) Gautama XIV, 44, and introduction to Gautama, p.\nliii.\n\n[30:36](sbe1407.htm#fr_187) Introduction to Gautama, pp. liii and liv.\n\n[30:37](sbe1407.htm#fr_188) Vish _n_ u XXII, 69. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\nand MS. B. read puya, p. 31 'pus,' instead of yupa, 'a sacrificial post.' The\nreading is, however, wrong, because the parallel passages of most Sm _ri_ tis\nenjoin that a man who has touched a sacrificial post shall bathe. The cause of\nthe mistake is probably a mere clerical error. The MSS. repeat the last word\nof this chapter, apa ityapa _h_. The reason is not, as K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_\n_d_ ita imagines, that the author wishes to indicate the necessity of bathing\nwhen one touches a person who has touched some impure thing or person. It is\nthe universal practice of the ancient authors to repeat the last word of a\nchapter in order to mark its end, see e _g_. Gautama note on I, 61. If it is\nneglected in the earlier chapters of the Vasish _th_ a Dharma-sutra, the\nbadness of the MSS. is the cause.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V](sbe1408.htm)\n\n"
