To thee, who dost not carp, verily shall I now declare this, the most\nprofound knowledge, united with realisation, having known which, thou shalt be\nfree from evil (Samsara).\n\np. 198\n\n2\\. Of sciences, the highest; of profundities, the deepest; of purifiers, the\nsupreme, is this; realisable by direct perception, endowed with (immense)\nmerit, very easy to perform, and of an imperishable nature.\n\n3\\. Persons without Shraddha for this Dharma, return, O scorcher of foes,\nwithout attaining Me, to the path of re-birth fraught with death. 3\n\np. 199\n\n4\\. All this world is pervaded by me in My unmanifested form: all beings exist\nin Me, but I do not dwell in them. 4\n\n5\\. Nor do beings exist in Me (in reality), behold My Divine Yoga! Bringing\nforth and supporting the beings, My Self does not dwell in them. 5\n\np. 200\n\n6\\. As the mighty wind, moving always everywhere, rests ever in the Akasha,\nknow thou, that even so do all beings rest in Me. 6\n\np. 201\n\n7\\. At the end of a Kalpa, O son of Kunti, all beings go back to My Prakriti:\nat the beginning of (another) Kalpa, I send them forth again. 7\n\n8\\. Animating My Prakriti, I project again and again this whole multitude of\nbeings, helpless under the sway of Prakriti. 8\n\np. 202\n\n9\\. These acts do not bind Me, sitting as one neutral, unattached to them, O\nDhananjaya. 9\n\n10\\. By reason of My proximity, Prakriti produces all this, the moving and the\nunmoving; the world wheels round and round, O son of Kunti, because of this.\n10\n\np. 203\n\n11\\. Unaware of My higher state, as the great Lord of beings, fools disregard\nMe, dwelling in the human form. 11\n\np. 204\n\n12\\. Of vain hopes, of vain works, of vain knowledge, and senseless, they\nverily are possessed of the delusive nature of Rakshasas and Asuras. 12\n\n13\\. But the great-souled ones, O son\n\np. 205\n\nof Pritha, possessed of the Divine Prakriti, knowing Me to be the origin of\nbeings, and immutable, worship Me with a single mind. 13\n\n14\\. Glorifying Me always and striving with firm resolve, bowing down to Me in\ndevotion, always steadfast, they worship Me.\n\n15\\. Others, too, sacrificing by the Yajna of knowledge ( _i.e._ , seeing the\nSelf in all), worship Me the All-Formed, as one, as distinct, as manifold. 15\n\np. 206\n\n16\\. I am the Kratu, I the Yajna, I the Svadha, I the Aushadham, I the Mantra,\nI the Ajyam, I the fire, and I the oblation. 16\n\np. 207\n\n17\\. I am the Father of this world, the Mother, the Sustainer, the\nGrandfather; the Purifier, the (one) thing to be known, (the syllable) Om, and\nalso the Rik, Saman and Yajus. 17\n\n18\\. The Goal, the Supporter, the Lord, the Witness, the Abode, the Refuge,\nthe Friend, the Origin, the Dissolution, the Substratum, the Storehouse, the\nSeed immutable. 18\n\np. 208\n\n19\\. (As sun) I give heat: I withhold and send forth rain; I am immortality\nand also death; being and non-being am I, O Arjuna! 19\n\np. 209\n\n20\\. The knowers of the three Vedas, worshipping Me by Yajna, drinking the\nSoma, and (thus) being purified from sin, pray for passage to heaven; reaching\nthe holy world of the Lord of the Devas, they enjoy in heaven the divine\npleasures of the Devas. 20\n\np. 210\n\n21\\. Having enjoyed the vast Swarga-world, they enter the mortal world, on the\nexhaustion of their merit: Thus, abiding by the injunctions of the three\n(Vedas), desiring desires, they (constantly) come and go. 21\n\n22\\. Persons who, meditating on Me as non-separate, worship Me in all beings,\nto them thus ever jealously engaged, I carry what they lack and preserve what\nthey already have. 22\n\np. 211\n\n23\\. Even those devotees, who endued with Shraddha, worship other gods, they\ntoo worship Me alone, O son of Kunti, (but) by the wrong method. 23\n\n24\\. For I alone am the Enjoyer, and Lord of all Yajnas; but because they do\nnot know Me in reality, they return, (to the mortal world). 24\n\np. 212\n\n25\\. Votaries of the Devas go to the Devas; to the Pitris, go their votaries;\nto the Bhutas, go the Bhuta worshippers; My votaries too come unto Me. 25\n\np. 213\n\n26\\. Whoever with devotion offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water, that\nI accept--the devout gift of the pure-minded. 26\n\n27\\. Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest, whatever thou offerest in\nsacrifice, whatever thou givest away, whatever austerity thou practisest, O\nson of Kunti, do that as an offering unto Me.\n\np. 214\n\n28\\. Thus shalt thou be freed from the bondages of actions, bearing good and\nevil results: with the heart steadfast in the Yoga of renunciation, and\nliberated, thou shalt come unto Me. 28\n\n29\\. I am the same to all beings: to Me there is none hateful or dear. But\nthose who worship Me with devotion, are in Me, and I too am in them. 29\n\np. 215\n\n30\\. If even a very wicked person worships Me, with devotion to none else, he\nshould be regarded as good, for he has rightly resolved. 30\n\np. 216\n\n31\\. Soon does he become righteous, and attain eternal Peace, O son of Kunti\nboldly canst thou proclaim, that My devotee is never destroyed.\n\n32\\. For, taking refuge in Me, they also, O son of Pritha, who might be of\ninferior birth,--women, Vaishyas, as well as Sudras,--even they attain to the\nSupreme Goal. 32\n\np. 217\n\n33\\. What need to mention holy Brahmanas, and devoted Rajarshis! Having\nobtained this transient, joyless world, worship thou Me. 33\n\np. 218\n\n34\\. Fill thy mind with Me, be My devotee, sacrifice unto Me, bow down to Me;\nthus having made thy heart steadfast in Me, taking Me as the Supreme Goal,\nthou shalt come to Me.\n\n\n\nThe end of the ninth chapter, designated The Way of the Kingly Knowledge and\nthe Kingly Secret.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[198:3](sbg14.htm#fr_195) _Without . . . Dharma:_ Who have no faith in this\nknowledge of the Self, regarding the physical body itself as the Self.\n\n[199:4](sbg14.htm#fr_196) _Unmanifested:_ being invisible to the senses.\n\n_Exist in Me_ --have an individual existence through Me, the Self, underlying\nthem all.\n\n_Do not dwell in them_ --like corporeal things--in contact with them, or\ncontained as though in a receptacle.\n\n[199:5](sbg14.htm#fr_197) p. 200 Vide vii. 12.\n\n_Nor do &c._--Because of the Self Being unattached to or unconnected with any\nobject. "Devoid of attachment. He is never attached."-- _Brih. Upa._ III--\nix-26.\n\n[200:6](sbg14.htm#fr_198) _Rests ever in the Ak asha_--without being attached\nto it.\n\nThe idea is that beings rest in the Lord without contact with, and so without\nproducing any effect on Him.\n\n[201:7](sbg14.htm#fr_199) _Prakriti:_ The inferior one composed of the three\nGunas.\n\n_Kalpa_ --a period of cosmic manifestation.\n\n[201:8](sbg14.htm#fr_200) _Animating My Prakriti_ --invigorating and\nfertilising the Prakriti dependent on Him, which had gone to sleep at the\nuniversal dissolution, at the end of the Kalpa.\n\n[202:9](sbg14.htm#fr_201) _These acts_ --which involve the unequal creation\nand dissolution of the universe.\n\nAs in the case of Ishvara, so in the case of others also, the absence of the\negotistic feeling of agency and attachment for results, is the cause of\nfreedom (from Dharma and Adharma).\n\n[202:10](sbg14.htm#fr_202) In verses VII to X the Lord defines His position,\nfollowing the Arundhati Nyaya. When a bride is brought to her husband\'s house\nfor the first time, he shows her a very tiny star, called Arundhati. To do\nthis, he has to direct her gaze the right way, p. 203 which he does by asking\nher to look at something near and something big, in the direction of the star,\n_e.g._ , a branch of a tree. Next, he draws her attention to a large bright\nstar observed beyond this branch, and so on, till by several steps, he\nsucceeds in leading her eyes to the right thing. This method of leading to a\nsubtle object through easy steps, is called Arundhati Nyaya. The Lord begins\nby stating that He projects all beings at the beginning of evolution: Prakriti\nis only an instrument in His hands. Next, He says, He is not affected by that\nact, since He sits by, as one neutral, perfectly unattached. Lastly, He leads\nup to the final truth that really He does nothing, that it is Prakriti, who\nanimated by His proximity produces all that is. It is His Light that lights up\nPrakriti, and makes her live and act. That is all the relation between Him and\nher.\n\n[203:11](sbg14.htm#fr_203) _Great Lord_ --Supreme Self.\n\n[204:12](sbg14.htm#fr_204) _Vain_ --because they neglect their own Self. They\nsee no Self beyond the body.\n\n_They_ --refers to those described in the preceding Sloka.\n\nRakshasas have Rajasika nature, Asuras, Tamasika.\n\n[205:13](sbg14.htm#fr_205) _Divine:_ Sattvika.\n\n[205:15](sbg14.htm#fr_206) _All-Formed:_ He who has assumed all the manifold\nforms in the universe.\n\n_As one_ --identifying himself with the All-Formed;--the Advaita view.\n\n_As distinct_ --making a distinction in essence between the Lord and\nhimself:--the Dualistic view.\n\n_As manifold_ --as the various divinities, Brahma, Rudra &c.\n\n[206:16](sbg14.htm#fr_207) _Kratu_ is a particular Vedic rite.\n\n_Yajna:_ The worship enjoined in the Smriti.\n\n_Svadh a:_ food offered to the manes (Pitris).\n\n_Aushadham:_ all vegetable food and medicinal herbs.\n\n_Mantra:_ the chant with which oblation is offered. Ajyam: articles of\noblation.\n\n_The fire_ --into which the offering is poured.\n\n[207:17](sbg14.htm#fr_208) _Sustainer_ --by dispensing fruit of action.\n\n[207:18](sbg14.htm#fr_209) p. 208 _Seed:_ cause of the origin of all things.\n\n_Immutable_ --because it endures so long as the Samsara endures.\n\n[208:19](sbg14.htm#fr_210) _Being:_ The manifested world of effects.\n\n_Non-being_ --means, the cause which is unmanifested only, and not non-\nexistence; otherwise we have to conceive existence coming out of nonexistence,\nwhich is absurd. The Sruti says, "How can existence come out of non-\nexistence?"-- _Chhand. Upa._ 6.\n\n[209:20](sbg14.htm#fr_211) _Lord of the Devas_ --Indra, who is called\nSatakratu, because he had performed a hundred sacrifices.\n\n[210:21](sbg14.htm#fr_212) _Injunctions_ --Ritualistic, the Karma-Kanda.\n\n[210:22](sbg14.htm#fr_213) _Anany ah_--as non-separate, _i.e._ , looking upon\nthe Supreme Being as not separate from their own self. Or Ananyah may mean,\nwithout any other (thought). Then the translation of the Sloka should be--\npersons who worship Me in all beings, never harbouring any other thought, to\nthem &c.\n\n_I carry &c._--Because while other devotees work for their own gain and\nsafety, those who do not see p. 211 anything as separate from themselves, do\nnot do so; they even do not cherish a desire for life; so the Lord secures to\nthem gain and safety.\n\n[211:23](sbg14.htm#fr_214) _Wrong method_ --ignorantly, not in the way by\nwhich they can get Moksha.\n\n[211:24](sbg14.htm#fr_215) p. 212 _They return_ --by worshipping other gods\nthey attain no doubt to the spheres of their sacrifice, but after the\nexhaustion of this merit, they fall from those spheres and return to the\nmortal world.\n\n[212:25](sbg14.htm#fr_216) _Bhutas_ --beings lower than the Devas, but higher\nthan human beings.\n\n_Me_ --The Imperishable.\n\n[213:26](sbg14.htm#fr_217) Not only does the single-minded devotion to the\nSupreme lead to imperishable result, but it is also so easy and simple to\nperform,--says Krishna in this Sloka.\n\n[214:28](sbg14.htm#fr_218) _The Yoga of renunciation_ --This way of\npurification of the heart by offering everything to the Lord.\n\n_Liberated &c._--thou shalt be liberated while in the body, and at its death,\nbecome Me.\n\n[214:29](sbg14.htm#fr_219) I am like fire. As fire gives heat to those who\ndraw near to it, and not to those who move away from it, even so do I. My\ngrace falls upon My p. 215 devotees, but not owing to any attachment on My\npart. As the sun\'s light, though pervading everywhere, is reflected in a clean\nmirror, so also I, the Supreme Lord, present as a matter of course everywhere,\nmanifest Myself in those persons only, from whose minds all the dirt of\nignorance has been removed by devotion.\n\n[215:30](sbg14.htm#fr_220) _He has rightly resolved_ --He is one who has\nformed a holy resolution, to abandon the evil ways of his life.\n\n[216:32](sbg14.htm#fr_221) _Of inferior birth . . . Sudras_ --Because by\nbirth, the Vaishyas are engaged only in agriculture &c., and the women and\nSudras are debarred from the study of the Vedas.\n\n[217:33](sbg14.htm#fr_222) _R ajarshis_--kings who have attained to sainthood\n(Rishihood).\n\n_What need &c.:_ How much more easily then do the holy Brahmanas and the\ndevoted royal saints attain that Goal!\n\n_Having . . . world_ --Being born in this human body which is hard to get, one\nshould exert oneself immediately for perfection, without depending on the\nfuture, as everything in this world is transient, and without seeking for\nhappiness, as this world is joyless.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Tenth Chapter.
