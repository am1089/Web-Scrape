(The pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _g_ ana _h_ are) the breath and so on, (as is seen) from\nthe complementary passage.\n\nThe mantra in which the pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _g_ ana _h_ are mentioned is followed by\nanother one in which breath and four other things are mentioned for the\npurpose of describing the nature of Brahman. 'They who know the breath of\nbreath, the eye of the eye, the ear of the ear, the food of food, the mind of\nmind  1.' Hence we conclude, on the ground of proximity, that the five-people\nare the beings mentioned in this latter mantra.--But how, the Sa _n_ khya\nasks, can the word 'people' be applied to the breath, the eye, the ear, and so\non?--How, we ask in return, can it be\n\np. 261\n\napplied to your categories? In both cases the common meaning of the word\n'people' has to be disregarded; but in favour of our explanation is the fact\nthat the breath, the eye, and so on, are mentioned in a complementary passage.\nThe breath, the eye, &c. may be denoted by the word 'people' because they are\nconnected with people. Moreover, we find the word 'person,' which means as\nmuch as 'people,' applied to the pra _n_ as in the passage, 'These are the\nfive persons of Brahman' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 13, 6); and another passage runs,\n'Breath is father, breath is mother,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 15, 1). And, owing\nto the force of composition, there is no objection to the compound being taken\nin its settled conventional meaning  1.--But how can the conventional meaning\nbe had recourse to, if there is no previous use of the word in that meaning?--\nThat may be done, we reply, just as in the case of udbhid and similar words\n2. We often infer that a word of unknown meaning refers to some known thing\nbecause it is used in connexion with the latter. So, for instance, in the case\nof the following words: 'He is to sacrifice with the udbhid; he cuts the yupa;\nhe makes the vedi.' Analogously we conclude that the term pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _g_ ana\n_h_ , which, from the grammatical rule quoted, is known to be a name, and\nwhich therefore demands a thing of which it is the name, denotes the breath,\nthe eye, and so on, which are connected with it through their being mentioned\nin a complementary passage.--Some commentators explain the word pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _g_\nana _h\n\n_\n\np. 262\n\nto mean the Gods, the Fathers, the Gandharvas, the Asuras, and the Rakshas.\nOthers, again, think that the four castes together with the Nishadas are\nmeant. Again, some scriptural passage ( _Ri_ g-veda Sa _m_ h. VIII, 53, 7)\nspeaks of the tribe of 'the five-people,' meaning thereby the created beings\nin general; and this latter explanation also might be applied to the passage\nunder discussion. The teacher (the Sutrakara), on the other hand, aiming at\nshowing that the passage does not refer to the twenty-five categories of the\nSa _n_ khyas, declares that on the ground of the complementary passage breath,\n&c. have to be understood.\n\nWell, let it then be granted that the five-people mentioned in the\nMadhyandina-text are breath, &c. since that text mentions food also (and so\nmakes up the number five). But how shall we interpret the Ka _n_ va-text which\ndoes not mention food (and thus altogether speaks of four things only)?--To\nthis question the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[260:1](sbe34123.htm#fr_241) So in the Madhyandina recension of the Upanishad;\nthe Ka _n_ va recension has not the clause 'the food of food.'\n\n[261:1](sbe34123.htm#fr_242) This in answer to the Sa _n_ khya who objects to\n_g_ ana when applied to the prana, &c. being interpreted with the help of\nlaksha _n_ a; while if referred to the pradhana, &c. it may be explained to\nhave a direct meaning, on the ground of yaugika interpretation (the pradhana\nbeing _g_ ana because it produces, the mahat &c. being _g_ ana because they\nare produced). The Vedantin points out that the compound pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _g_ ana _h_\nhas its own ru _dh_ i-meaning, just as a _s_ vakar _n_ a, literally horse-ear,\nwhich conventionally denotes a certain plant.\n\n[261:2](sbe34123.htm#fr_243) We infer that udbhid is the name of a sacrifice\nbecause it is mentioned in connexion with the act of sacrificing; we infer\nthat the yupa is a wooden post because it is said to be cut, and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 13](sbe34124.htm)\n\n"
