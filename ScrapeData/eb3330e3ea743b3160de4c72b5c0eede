Vyasa said :-- O Bharata! I now narrate to you about the relief of the\nburden of the Earth, the destruction by the Yoga Maya of the armies Kuruk _s_\nettra and Prabhasa, the two sacred places, and about the birth, due to the\ncurse of Bhrigu, of the Bhagavan Hari, of unparalleled prowess, under the\ninfluence of Mahamaya, in the race of Yadu. Now hear.\n\n\n\n3\\. Vi _sn_ u\xc2\x92s taking birth in the world was effected under the circumstances\ncaused by Yoga Maya, to relieve the burden of the Earth; this is my opinion.\n\n\n\nN. B. :-- Prabhasa is a well-known place of pilgrimage near Dvarka, in\nGujerat.\n\n\n\n4\\. O king! When the Goddess Mahamaya, the Incarnate of the three qualities\ncan make Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and the other Devas dance incessantly as their\nInternal Controller, then what wonder, that She would appear charming to the\nother Jivas and make them dance incessantly, as wooden dolls.\n\n\n\n5\\. All the troubles incurred in remaining in the womb, amidst the urine,\nexcreta and tissues, She had brought to bear finally on Vi _sn_ u by Her ever\nfamous Leela (Divine Sport).\n\n\n\n6\\. In days of yore, in Rama incarnation, She, That Supreme Goddess made the\nGods become monkeys and you know very well already, what amount of trouble\nBhagavan Vi _sn_ u had to undergo by the hard iron chain of bondage, \xc2\x93This is\nmine, this is I,\xc2\x94 etc., imposed by Maya.\n\n\n\n7\\. The Yogis who want final liberation and who have abandoned all their\nattachments and who want devotion, they worship the Supreme Goddess of the\nUniverse, the Incarnate of Auspiciousness.\n\n\n\n8\\. O king! Who will not serve Her? A trace of devotion towards Whom effects\nat once the salvation of the Jivas.\n\n\n\n9\\. If any human being utters simply the name \xc2\x93Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari\xc2\x94 (the Goddess of\nUniverse) She gives him the three worlds; and if any one cries and utters for\nhelp \xc2\x93Save me,\xc2\x94 then the Goddess of the Universe, being unable to find\nanything that She can repay him as a fit recompense for his utterance, becomes\nHerself indebted to that man.\n\n\n\n10\\. O King! Know Vidya (knowledge) and Avidya (non-knowledge, spiritual\nignorance, lower knowledge) Her two forms; Vidya gives liberation; Avidya\ncauses bondage.\n\n\n\n11\\. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra, all these and their Avataras are Her\ninstruments and are under Her subjection, as if they are all fastened by a\ncord.\n\n\n\n12-14. The Bhagavan Hari sometimes resides in Vaikun _t_ ha, sometimes resides\nin the sea of milk and enjoys pleasures, sometimes fights the powerful\nDanavas, sometimes performs extensive sacrificial ceremonies\n\n\n\np. 324\n\n\n\nsometimes performs severe asceticism and sometimes takes to deep sleep under\nthe guidance of Yoga Maya. Thus He never becomes free and independent.\n\n\n\n15-16. O King! And like Vi _sn_ u, Brahma, Rudra, the other Gods Indra, Varu\n_n_ a, Yama, Kuvera, Agni, the Sun, Moon and other celestial gods, the Sanaka\nand other Munis, Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha and other Ri _s_ is, all are incessantly\ncontrolled by the Supreme Goddess, as if they are the dolls in the hands of a\nplaying magician.\n\n\n\n17\\. All the Devas are controlled by the noose of Time, just as oxen are\nbrought under control by men, by strings passed within their noses.\n\n\n\n18\\. O King! Pleasure, pain, sleep, lassitude, idleness, and other passions\nand feelings are always found inherent in every embodied being.\n\n\n\n19-23. The Devas are written down by authors in their books as not subject to\ndeath or decay; this statement is merely nominal and not real; for whoever is\nalways subject to birth, growth, decay and death how can we call him immortal\nor beyond old age and death? Why do the Devas get into sorrows, and troubles?\nHow can they be called gods? How can one enjoy when one is involved in a\ntrouble? In this world, it is seen mosquitoes and other insects born from\nwater die after a very short time; so, like these, the Devas at the expiry of\ntheir ordained life-period, die too. Then why not the Devas be treated like\nthose insects? Why not shall we term them, \xc2\x93Mortal\xc2\x94?\n\n\n\n24-25. Some human beings live one year; some others live upto one hundred\nyears, the Devas live longer than men; the life of the Prajapati Brahma\nexceeds those of the Devas; Rudra lives longer than Brahma; and Vi _sn_ u\nlives longer than Rudra. All these are thus subject by turns to birth, growth,\nand decay.\n\n\n\n26\\. Those who are born, they die; those that die are again born. Thus O King!\nIn this world all the Jivas, no doubt, move round and round like a wheel.\n\n\n\n27\\. The Jivas are deluded by the network of Moha (charms) and thus deluded.\nThey can never gain final release. So long as Maya exists in them, their\ndelusion is not destroyed.\n\n\n\n28\\. O King! At the time of creation Brahma and all other things came into\nexistence, in due order, and these will duly dissolve at the time of the Great\nDissolution (the Pralaya)?\n\n\n\np. 325\n\n\n\n29\\. Whatever is the cause of destruction to anybody here, that destroys the\nbody in question. According to the Will Power of the Supreme Goddess, whatever\nis created by Brahma, no none can undo that. Know this as perfectly certain.\n\n\n\n30\\. Know this the predestined law that the birth, death, old age, diseases,\npain or pleasure overtake all the Jivas according to the prescribed order of\nNature; never these laws fail to operate in their actions.\n\n\n\n31\\. See! The Devas that we see with our physical eyes, the Sun and Moon yield\npleasure to all; still they suffer always troubles at the hands of their\nenemies (i.e., Rahu and Ketu, i.e., there always take place regularly solar\nand lunar eclipses, when they are in the ascending and descending modes.) This\nsuffering is never removed.\n\n\n\n32\\. The son of the Sun (Saturn) is always injurious to people; hence it is\ntermed \xc2\x93Manda\xc2\x94 (bad); the Moon was attacked with consumption and bears stain\non his body (spots in the Moon disc). What to speak of ordinary men? The great\nmen even are subject to the prescribed laws of Fate and Nature.\n\n\n\n33\\. The Creator of the world, the four faced Brahma is the author of the\nVedas and awarder of Intelligence. He, too, on seeing Sarasvati, his own\ndaughter, was afflicted with passion.\n\n\n\n34\\. When Sati, the wife of S\xc2\x92iva, left off Her mortal coil, Mahadeva, though\nHe could remove the sorrows of all, was very much moved with passion and\ngreatly afflicted.\n\n\n\n35\\. Then, being burnt very much as it were by the fire of passion, he threw\nhimself down into the water of the river Kalindi; and the water of that river\nbecame black-coloured, as if burnt by the burning fire of the sorrows of\nS\xc2\x92iva.\n\n\n\n36-37. O King! When Mahadeva, being infatuated with Kama, went into the forest\nof Bhrigu and becoming naked, began to copulate, the ascetic Bhrigu, seeing\nhim in that state, exclaimed \xc2\x93O You are very shameless\xc2\x94 and cursed Him thus\n:-- Let your penis drop off just now. Mahadeva, then to satisfy his thirst for\npassion, began to drink the water of the lake Amrita Vapi, dug by the Danavas.\n\n\n\n38-39. Indra, too, the Lord of the Devas, turned into a bull and carried Vi\n_sn_ u on his back on the face of the earth. What to speak where the\nomniscience and omnipotence disappeared of Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, Who is the\nFirst of all created beings and possessed of reason, and discrimination? Oh!\nWhat a great wonder, that He could not know about the golden deer?\n\n\n\n40-41. Judge, O King! for yourself, the great power of Maya, that even Rama\nChandra was deluded by passion, and very much grieved for the\n\n\n\np. 326\n\n\n\nseparation from his dear wife Sita, and wept much for Her. Greatly deluded, he\nbegan to cry aloud and ask the trees \xc2\x93Where has gone My Sita, the daughter of\nJanaka? Is she devoured by the rapacious animals? or whether is she stolen by\nsome mischievous person?\n\n\n\n42-44. O Brother Lak _s_ ma _n_ a! I am being consumed by the fire of\nseparation from my beloved; I will commit suicide now; and you too will die\ndue to the separation from me; our mother, too, would die when they will hear\nof our deaths; Satrugh _n_ a, too, will be very much afflicted at our death\nand will not hold his life. The mother Sumitra, too, will destroy her life,\nbeing afflicted with her son\xc2\x92s demise; and then Bharata\xc2\x92s and his mother\xc2\x92s\ndesires will certainly be fulfilled.\n\n\n\n45\\. O Sita! I am very much moved by your separation; where have you gone,\nleaving me here! O deer-eyed, O one of thin waist! come; give life unto me!\n\n\n\n46\\. What shall I do? Where shall I go? My life is entirely dependent on you,\nO daughter of Janaka! I am your darling! Now I am very much depressed owing to\nyour separation. Please come and speak to me words of hope and courage.\n\n\n\n47\\. Though Rama, of unequalled prowess, roamed about weeping from forest to\nforest, yet he could not find out Sita.\n\n\n\n48-49. He, who is the Refuge of all the worlds, the lotus-eyed Rama, got\nentangled into the delusion of Maya and had to take refuge Himself under the\nmonkeys, and with their help, constructed the bridge across the ocean, crossed\nthe ocean and was thus able to kill the valiant warriors Kumbhakar _n_ a and\nRava _n_ a.\n\n\n\n50\\. Then Rama got back His Sita before him but suspecting, since she had been\nstolen by the vicious Rava _n_ a, made her take an oath, though it is to, be\nremembered that Rama was all-knowing.\n\n\n\n51\\. O King! The power of Yoga Maya is very great; what shall I speak of Her\ngreat power? This whole cosmos is always urged into activity by Her and thus\ngoes rolling on and on incessantly.\n\n\n\n52\\. Thus, in various incarnations, Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u was always under the\ninfluence of previous curse and also under the control of Destiny and had to\ndo various functions incessantly.\n\n\n\n53\\. O King! Now I will speak to you about the birth of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a in the\nworld for serving the purposes of gods, and will narrate His Leela.\n\n\n\np. 327\n\n\n\n54\\. In days of yore, on the delightful banks of the river Kalindi, there was\na place, called Madhuban, where lived a powerful Daitya named Lavana, the son\nof Madhu.\n\n\n\n55-56. That wicked Demon was exceedingly arrogant, on getting a boon, and he\nused to give an enormous amount of trouble to the Dvijas. Satrugh _n_ a the\nyounger of Lak _s_ ma _n_ , killed that uncontrollable Daitya and built a very\nbeautiful city there and named it Mathura.\n\n\n\n57\\. The intelligent Satrugh _n_ a, the destroyer of enemies, installed his\ntwo lotus-eyed sons in that kingdom and, when his end came, went to Heaven.\n\n\n\n58\\. Afterwards on the decline of the Solar race, the Yadavas, born of the\nrace of Yayati, occupied that Mathura city, giving salvation to all.\n\n\n\n59\\. O King! There reigned in Mathura city one Yadava king, valiant warrior,\nnamed S\xc2\x92urasena; and he enjoyed all the pleasures Mathura.\n\n\n\n60\\. Under the curse of Varu _n_ a, Vasudeva took his birth as the son of the\nrenowned S\xc2\x92urasena, as the part incarnate of Kas\xc2\x92yapa.\n\n\n\n61\\. He took up the profession of a Vais\xc2\x92ya and engaged himself in\nagriculture. And on the death of his father, the prosperous and wealthy\nUgrasena became the King of Mathura. The powerful Kamsa was the son Ugrasena.\n\n\n\n62\\. On the other hand, the King Devaka had a daughter born to him named\nDevaki, the part incarnate of Aditi. She under the curse of Varu _n_ a,\nfollowed Kas\xc2\x92yapa.\n\n\n\n63\\. The high souled King Devaka performed the marriage ceremony of his\ndaughter Devaki with Vasudeva.\n\n\n\n64\\. When this marriage ceremony was over, a voice was heard from Heaven,\nsaying :-- O fortunate Kamsa! The eighth son of this Devaki will take away\nyour life.\n\n\n\n65\\. The powerful Kamsa, hearing that voice from Heaven, was surprised and\ntook it to be true and became very anxious.\n\n\n\n66-67. Kamsa began to argue in his mind. Once he thought \xc2\x93I would today\ndestroy her; then my death won\xc2\x92t take place; for I can\xc2\x92t see any other way of\nescape from this difficulty,\xc2\x94 again he thought, \xc2\x93She is my sister, daughter of\nmy paternal uncle and therefore fit to be worshipped; how can I kill her!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n68\\. Lastly, he came to the final conclusion, thus \xc2\x93She is the cause of my\ndeath, though she is my sister, fit to be worshipped; to kill her will not\n\n\n\np. 328\n\n\n\nlead me to sin; for it is enjoined by the wise :-- Do even a sin to avert\none\xc2\x92s own death.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n69\\. The sins can be remedied always by penances. Therefore to save one\xc2\x92s\nlife, by committing even a sinful act, ought to be done by the wise.\n\n\n\n70-71. The vicious Kamsa thus arguing, holding the scabbard in his hand, drew\nfrom it the sword and dragged and caught hold of the newly married handsome\nwoman by her hair to kill her before the presence of the public.\n\n\n\n72\\. A cry of universal consternation and distress arose on all sides, seeing\nKamsa thus ready to kill Devaki; then the warriors, under Vasudeva, at once\nraised their bows and arrows, ready to fight.\n\n\n\n73\\. These wonderfully valorous warriors loudly exclaimed to Kamsa, \xc2\x93Leave\nDevaki at once\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Leave Devaki at once\xc2\x94 and then they were finally able out of\ntheir mercy to release the Devamata Devaki, from the hold of the vicious\nKamsa.\n\n\n\n74\\. Deadly battles ensued then between the powerful Kamsa and those valorous\nwarriors on Vasudeva\xc2\x92s side.\n\n\n\n75-76. Seeing the exceedingly terrible battle, the old Yadavas asked Kamsa to\ndesist from such a battle and advised him thus. This Devaki is your sister;\nyou ought to pay her respects. Did you not consider even for a moment that she\nis as yet a girl. O Hero! You ought not to kill her at the time of this joyous\nmarriage ceremony.\n\n\n\n77\\. O Valiant Warrior! The murder of a woman is intolerable! Destroyer of\nfame, and most heinous crime! You should also consider that learned persons\nought not to commit such dastardly acts as the murdering of females, depending\nsimply on a voice from heaven, a very ordinary thing!\n\n\n\n78\\. It may be that some of your Vasudeva\xc2\x92s enemy has uttered that harmful\nword, hiding himself from your sight. No reason can be shewn contrary to this.\n\n\n\n79\\. We are of opinion that to ruin your name and to destroy the house of\nVasudeva, some magician, expert in black magic, your enemy has framed this\nvoice from Heaven.\n\n\n\n80\\. O king! You are a hero; why do you fear the words of a devil. We firmly\nbelieve, there is no doubt, that this is done by your malicious enemy to ruin\nyour name.\n\n\n\n81\\. O king! What is destined to take place, will take place; no one can stand\nagainst it otherwise. Therefore, at this marriage festivity, you ought never\nto kill this your respected sister.\n\n\n\np. 329\n\n\n\n82-83. O King Janamejaya! Though made to understand thus by the old wise\nYadavas, the king Kamsa did not desist from his purpose; S\xc2\x92ri Vasudeva, versed\nin morals, told him \xc2\x93Kamsa! These three worlds are established on Truth. I say\non Truth that I will hand over to you all my sons, born of the womb of Devaki,\nno sooner they are born.\n\n\n\n84\\. And if I do not deliver to you all those sons, no sooner they are born\nthen all my forefathers will fall down into the hell called Kumbihpaka.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n85-86. The descendants of Puru, that were present there, hearing his truthful\nwords, praised him repeatedly and told Kamsa \xc2\x93Vasudeva is a high minded\npersonage; he is surely not to tell a lie. Therefore, O Thou, blessed one! Now\nleave Devaki and be free from committing the murder of woman.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n87\\. O king! Thus made to understand by the aged high minded Yadavas the king\nKamsa accepted the truthful words of Vasudeva and abandoned his anger.\n\n\n\n88\\. Then the Dunduvis and other sounding instruments were sounded; and their\nsounds filled the place; and all repeatedly uttered jai, jai.\n\n\n\n89\\. Then the famous Vasudeva, the son of S\xc2\x92urasena, thus pleased the king\nKamsa and freed Devaki; and, surrounded by his relatives, he went quickly\nwithout any fear to his own house, accompanied by Devaki.\n\n\n\nHere ends the 20th chapter in the 4th Adhyaya of S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam, the\nMaha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa, on Devaki\xc2\x92s\nmarriage.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 21](bk04ch21.htm)\n\n'
