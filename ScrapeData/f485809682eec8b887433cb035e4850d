Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! This Aru _n_ oda river that I mentioned\nto you rises from the Mandara mountain and flows by the east of Ilavar _s_ a.\nThe Pavana Deva (the God of wind) takes up the nice smell from the bodies of\nthe wives of the Yak _s_ as and Gandharbas, etc., and the attendants of the\nDevi Bhavani and keeps the surroundings of the earth there filled with nice\nsmell for ten Yoyanas around. Again the rose-apples with their nuts, of the\nsize of an elephant, fall down upon the earth from the high peaks of the\nmountain Mandara and break into pieces; the sweet scented juices flow down as\na river. This is called the Jambu river and this flows by the south of Ilavar\n_s_ a. The Devi Bhagavati there is pleased with the Juice of that rose-apple\n(Jambu) and is known by the name of Jambadini. The Devas, Nagas, and Ri _s_ is\nall always worship with great devotion, the lotus-feet of the merciful Devi,\nwishing the welfare of all the Jivas. The mere remembering of the name of the\nDevi destroys all the disease, and all the sins of the sinner. Therefore the\nDevas always worship and chant the names of the Devi, the Remover of all\nobstacles. She is installed on both the banks of the Jambu river. If men\nrecite Her names Kokilak _s_ i, Karu _n_ a, Kamapujita, Ka _t_ horavigraha,\nDevapujya, Dhanya, Gavastini and worship, so they get their welfare both in\nthis world and in the next. With the juice of the Jambu fruit aided by the\ncombination of the wind and the rays of the Sun, is created the gold. Out of\nthis are made the ornaments for the wives of the Immortals and the\nVidyadharas. This gold, created by the Daiva, is known by the name of the\nJambunada gold. The love-stricken Devas make their crowns, waist bands and\narmlets out of this gold for their sweet-hearts. There is a big Kadamba tree\non the mountain Supars'va; the five streams of honey called Madhu Dhara get\n\n\n\np. 753\n\n\n\nout from its cavities and running by the west of Ilavrita Var _s_ a, flow over\nthe land. The Devas drink its waters; and their mouths become filled with the\nsweet fragrance. The air carries this sweet fragrant smell to a distance of\neven one hundred Yoyanas. The Dhares'vari Maha Devi dwells there, the\nFulfiller of the desires of the Bhaktas, highly energetic, of the nature of\nKala (the Time, the Destroyer), and having large face (Mahanana), faces\neverywhere, worshipped by the Devas and is the presiding Deity of the woods\nand forests all around. The Devi, the Lady of the Devas, is to be worshipped\nby the names \xc2\x93Karala Deha,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Kalamgi\xc2\x94, \xc2\x93Kamako _t_ ipravartini\xc2\x94. The great\nBanyan tree named S'atabala is situated on the top of the Kumud mountain. From\nits trunk many big rivers take their origin. These rivers possess such\ninfluences as to give to the holy persons there, the milk, curd, honey,\nclarified butter, raw sugar, rice, clothing, ornaments, seats, and beddings,\netc., whatever they desire. Therefore these rivers are called Kamadugh. They\ncome gradually down the earth and flow by the north of Ilavar _s_ a. The\nBhagavati Minak _s_ i dwell there and is worshipped by the Suras and the\nAsuras alike. That Deity clothed blue, of fearful countenance, and ornamented\nwith hairs of blue colour, always fulfil the desires of the Devas dwelling in\nthe Heavens. Those that worship Her, remember Her or praise Her by the names\nAtimanya, Atipujya, Mattamata _n_ ga Gamini, Madanonmadini, Manapriya,\nManapriyatara, Marabegadhara, Marapujita, Maramadini, Mayuravaras'obhadhya,\nS'ikhivahanagarbhabhu, etc., are honoured by the Deity Minalochana Ekangarupi\n_n_ i and the Parames'vara and get all sorts of happiness. Those drink the\nclear waters of these rivers become free from old age or decay, worry,\nperspiration, bad smell, from any disease, or premature death. They do not\nsuffer anything from error, from cold, heat, or rains, or from any paleness in\ntheir colour. They enjoy extreme happiness as long as they live and no dangers\ncome to them. O Child! Now hear the names of the other twenty mountains that\nencircle the Golden Sumeru mountain at its base, as if they were the filaments\nround the pericarp of a flower. The first is Kura _n_ ga; they come in order\nKuraga, Kus'umbha, Vikankata, Triku _t_ a, S'is'ira, Patanga, Ruchaka, Ni _s_\nadha, S'itivasa, Kapila, S'amkha, Vaidurya, Charudhi, Hamsa, Ri _s_ abha,\nNaga, Kalanjara and lastly Narada. The central one is the twentieth.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the rivers and the mountains\nSumeru and others in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000\nverses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7](bk08ch07.htm)\n\n"
