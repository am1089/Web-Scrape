He recites after uttering (the syllable) \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85!\' Sacrifice, they\nsay, is not (performed) without the Saman; and neither is the Saman chanted\nwithout \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85\' having been uttered. By his uttering \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85!\' the peculiar nature\n(rupam) of the word \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85\' is produced (in the sacrifice); and by the sacred\nsyllable (om) it assumes the nature of the Saman. By uttering \'Om! Om 1!\' this\nhis entire sacrifice becomes endowed with the Saman.\n\np. 101\n\n1:4:1:22\\. And (another reason) why he utters \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85!\' is this. The word \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85\'\nmeans breath, for the word Hi\xe1\xb9\x85\' does indeed mean breath: he cannot therefore\npronounce the word \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85,\' when he closes his nostrils. The _ri_ _k_ (verse) he\nrecites with his voice. Now, voice and breath are a pair, so that a productive\nunion of the samidhenis is thereby effected at the outset: for this reason he\nrecites, after uttering \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85!\'\n\n1:4:1:33\\. He utters the word \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85\' in a low voice. Were he, on the contrary,\nto pronounce \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85\' aloud, he would make \'voice\' of both the one and the other:\nfor this reason he utters the word \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85\' in a low voice.\n\n1:4:1:44\\. He recites with \'a (hither)!\' and \'pra (forth or thither) 1!\' He\nthereby joins a gayatri verse directed hitherward to one directed away from\nhere: the one which tends from hence carries the sacrifice to the gods, and\nthe one which tends hitherward pleases the men. For this reason he recites\nwith \'a\' and \'pra.\'\n\n1:4:1:55\\. And (another reason) why he recites with \'a\' and \'pra,\' is this.\n\'Pra (forth)\' clearly means out-breathing, and \'a (hither)\' means in-\nbreathing: hence he thereby obtains out-breathing and in-breathing (for the\nsacrificer). For this reason he recites with \'a\' and \'pra.\'\n\np. 102\n\n1:4:1:66\\. Yet (other reasons) why he recites with \'hither (a)\' and \'thither\n(pra),\' are these. \'Thither\' the seed is cast, and \'hither\' birth takes place.\n\'Thither\' the cattle disperse (for grazing), \'hither\' they return. Indeed,\neverything here (moves) \'hither\' and \'thither:\' for this reason he recites\nwith \'a\' and \'pra.\'\n\n1:4:1:77\\. He recites 1, \'Forth go your viands, heavenward!\'--\n\np. 103\n\nhereby, then, the \'thither\' is (realised). And (in the second verse), \'Come\nhither, Agni, to expand 1!\'--by this, on the other hand, the \'hither\' is\n(realised).\n\n1:4:1:88\\. Now, in reference to this point, some people say, \'Both these\n(texts) surely result in a "thither 2."\' This, however, is beyond the ordinary\nunderstanding: the text, \'forth go your viands, heavenward!\' is clearly\n(directed) away from (the sacrificer); and the text, \'Come hither, Agni, to\nexpand!\' is (directed) towards (him).\n\n1:4:1:99\\. He recites (the first kindling verse), \'Forth go your viands,\nheavenward!\' this, then, tends in a forward direction. \'Viands\' (va _g_ a) 3\nhe says, because viands mean food: hence food is obtained (for the sacrificer)\nby this recitation. \'Heavenward\' he says, because those that tend heavenward\nare the half-moons:\n\np. 104\n\nit is, therefore, the half-moons which he obtains by this recitation. \'In\nhavis rich\' he further says, because those that are rich in havis (milk,\nbutter) are the cattle; it is cattle, therefore, that he thereby obtains\nthrough the recitation.\n\n1:4:1:1010\\. \'With buttered (spoon)--\' he adds. Now Mathava, the (king of)\nVidegha 1, carried Agni Vai _s_ vanara in his mouth. The _Ri_ shi Gotama\nRahuga _n_ a was his family priest. When addressed (by the latter), he made no\nanswer to him, fearing lest Agni might fall from his mouth.\n\n1:4:1:1111\\. He (the priest) began to invoke the latter with\n\np. 105\n\nverses of the Rig-veda, \'We kindle thee at the sacrifice, O wise Agni, thee\nthe radiant, the mighty caller to the sacrificial feast (Rig-veda V, 26, 3)!--\nO Videgha!\'\n\n1:4:1:1212\\. He (the king) did not answer. (The priest went on), \'Upwards, O\nAgni, dart thy brilliant, shining rays, thy flames, thy beams (Rig-veda VIII,\n44, 16)!--O Videgha-a-a!\'\n\n1:4:1:1313\\. Still he did not answer. (The priest continued), \'Thee, O butter-\nsprinkled one, we invoke! (Rig-veda V, 26, 2);\' so much he uttered, when at\nthe very mentioning of butter, Agni Vai _s_ vanara flashed forth from the\n(king\'s) mouth: he was unable to hold him back; he issued from his mouth, and\nfell down on this earth.\n\n1:4:1:1414\\. Mathava, the Videgha, was at that time on the (river) Sarasvati\n1. He (Agni) thence went burning along this earth towards the east; and Gotama\nRahuga _n_ a and the Videgha Mathava followed after him as he was burning\nalong. He burnt over (dried up) all these rivers. Now that (river), which is\ncalled \'Sadanira,\' flows from the northern (Himalaya) mountain: that one he\ndid not burn over. That one the Brahmans did not cross in former times,\nthinking, \'it has not been burnt over by Agni Vai _s_ vanara.\'\n\n1:4:1:1515\\. Now-a-days, however, there are many Brahmans to the east of it.\nAt that time it (the land east of the Sadanira) was very uncultivated, very\nmarshy, because it had not been tasted by Agni Vai _s_ vanara.\n\n1:4:1:1616\\. Now-a-days, however, it is very cultivated, for the Brahmans have\ncaused (Agni) to taste it through\n\np. 106\n\nsacrifices. Even in late summer that (river), as it were, rages along 1: so\ncold is it, not having been burnt over by Agni Vai _s_ vanara.\n\n1:4:1:1717\\. Mathava, the Videgha, then said (to Agni), \'Where am I to abide?\'\n\'To the east of this (river) be thy abode!\' said he. Even now this (river)\nforms the boundary of the Kosalas and Videhas; for these are the Mathavas (or\ndescendants of Mathava).\n\n1:4:1:1818\\. Gotama Rahuga _n_ a then said (to Mathava), \'Why didst thou not\nanswer when addressed by us?\' He replied, \'Agni Vai _s_ vanara was in my\nmouth; I did not reply, lest he should escape from my mouth.\'\n\n1:4:1:1919\\. \'How then did this happen?\'--\'At the moment when thou didst utter\nthe words, "(Thee), O butter-sprinkled one, we invoke!" just then, at the\nmention of butter, Agni Vai _s_ vanara flashed forth from my mouth; I was\nunable to hold him back, he issued from my mouth.\'\n\n1:4:1:2020\\. That (word) in the samidhenis, therefore, which contains butter\n(gh _ri_ ta) is especially suitable for kindling (sam-indh); and by it he\naccordingly kindles him (Agni, the fire) and bestows vigour on this\n(sacrificer).\n\n1:4:1:2121\\. Now that (word) is gh _ri_ ta _k_ ya, \'with the buttered\n(spoon).\'--\'He nears 2 the gods, wishful of bliss.\' Wishful of bliss, truly,\nis the sacrificer, since he wishes to approach the gods, to go to 3\n\np. 107\n\nthe gods: therefore he says, \'he nears the gods, wishful of bliss.\' This\n(verse), which is addressed to Agni, is undefined (vague); and undefined,\ndoubtless, is the \'All;\' he thus commences (this holy work) with the All.\n\n1:4:1:2222\\. [He recites the second samidheni]: \'Come hither, Agni, to\nexpand!\'--\'To expand\' he says, because at the beginning these worlds were\nwell-nigh contiguous to one another: at that time one could touch the sky thus\n1.\n\n1:4:1:2323\\. The gods desired, \'How could these worlds of ours become farther\napart from one another? How could there be more space for us?\' They breathed\nthrough them (the worlds) with these three syllables (forming the word)\n\'vitaye 2,\' and these worlds became far apart from one another; and there was\nthen ampler space for the gods: ample space, therefore, he will have for whom,\nknowing this, they recite this (verse) containing (the word) \'vitaye.\'\n\n1:4:1:2424\\. He proceeds, \'Invoked for the giver of oblations!\' \'The giver of\noblations 3,\' of course, is the\n\np. 108\n\nsacrificer: hence \'invoked for the sacrificer\' is what he thereby means to\nsay.--\'As Hot _ri_ on the barhis sit!\' Agni, indeed, is the Hot _ri_ , and the\nbarhis (the covering of sacrificial grass on the altar) is this world: hence\nhe thereby establishes Agni (the fire) in this world, as this fire is\nestablished (or, beneficial, hita) in this world. This (verse), then, is\nrecited with reference to this world (the earth): through it this world is\nconquered by him for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse).\n\n1:4:1:2525\\. [He recites the third samidheni]: \'With samidhs thee, O A\xe1\xb9\x85giras!\'\n--with samidhs (kindling-sticks), indeed, the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras kindled him. \'O\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras!\' he says, for Agni is indeed A\xe1\xb9\x85giras 1.--\'With butter we exhilarate!\'\nThis (viz. gh _ri_ tena, \'with butter\') is a word which is especially suitable\nfor the kindling of Agni: by it he kindles him, and bestows vigour on this\n(sacrificer).\n\n1:4:1:2626\\. \'Shine forth, O youngest, brilliantly!\' he adds; for brilliantly\nhe shines, when kindled; and \'O youngest!\' he says, because he is really the\nyoungest Agni 2: therefore he says, \'O youngest!\' This (verse) is recited with\nreference to yonder world, to wit, the aerial world; hence this (verse), which\nis addressed to Agni, is undefined, for undefined is yonder world: that world\nhe thereby gains, for whom, knowing this, they recite this verse.\n\n1:4:1:2727\\. [He recites the fourth samidheni]: \'Agni, do thou obtain for us\nthat (region) wide and\n\np. 109\n\nglorious!\' For wide, indeed, is yonder (region) wherein the gods (dwell), and\nglorious is that (region) wherein the gods (dwell). When he says, \'Do thou\nobtain for us 1,\' he means to say, \'make us go to it!\'\n\n1:4:1:2828\\. \'That great and mighty one, O God!\' For great, indeed, is yonder\n(region) wherein the gods (dwell), and mighty 2 is that wherein the gods\n(dwell). This (verse), then, is recited with reference to yonder world: that\nheavenly world he thereby gains, for whom, knowing this, they recite this\n(verse).\n\n1:4:1:2929\\. He recites (the fifth samidheni): \'Praiseworthy he, adorable,\'\nfor worthy of praise he is, and worthy of adoration;--\'visible through the\nveil of gloom,\' for when kindled he is seen right through the gloom;--\'Agni,\nthe mighty one (bull), is lit,\' for he is indeed lit up, the mighty one.\n\n[He recites the sixth samidheni]: \'The mighty Agni is lit up,\' for he is\nindeed lit up.\n\n1:4:1:3030\\. \'Yea 3, as a horse that bears the gods,\' for having become a\nhorse he does indeed carry the sacrifice to the gods: the (word) \'na\' which\noccurs in this verse has the meaning of \'om\' (verily); hence he says, \'Yea, as\na horse that bears to the gods.\'\n\np. 110\n\n1:4:1:3131\\. \'With offerings him they glorify,\' for with offerings men indeed\nglorify him; therefore he says, \'with offerings him they glorify.\'\n\n1:4:1:3232\\. [He recites the seventh samidheni): \'O mighty one 1! we mighty\nmen do kindle thee, the mighty one!\' for they indeed kindle him;--\'O Agni,\nthee that brightly shines!\' for he indeed shone brightly when he was kindled.\n\n1:4:1:3333\\. He recites this tristich which contains the word (v _ri_ shan),\n\'mighty.\' All these kindling verses, it is true, are addressed to Agni; Indra,\nhowever, is the deity of sacrifice, Indra is the mighty (hero); hence these\nhis (the sacrificer\'s) kindling verses thereby become possessed of Indra: this\nis the reason why he recites the tristich containing the word \'mighty.\'\n\n1:4:1:3434\\. He recites [the eighth samidheni]: \'Agni we choose as messenger!\'\nNow the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprang from Pra _g_ apati, were\ncontending for superiority. When they were thus contending, the gayatri stood\nbetween them. That gayatri was the same as this earth, and this earth indeed\nlay between them 2. Now both of them knew that whichever she would side with,\nthey would be victorious and the others would be defeated. Both parties then\ninvited her secretly to come to them. Agni acted as messenger for the gods;\nand an Asura-Rakshas, named\n\np. 111\n\n[paragraph continues] Saharakshas 1, for the Asuras. She then followed Agni:\nhe therefore recites, \'Agni we choose for messenger,\' because he was the\nmessenger of the gods.--\'As Hot _ri_ the all-knowing, him!\'\n\n1:4:1:3535\\. Here now some people recite, \'He who is the Hot _ri_ of the all-\nknowing 2;\' lest (in saying \'for Hot _ri_ , the all-knowing, him\') one should\nsay to oneself \'enough (i.e. have done)!\' This, however, he should not do; for\nby (doing) so they do at the sacrifice what is human; and what is human, is\ninauspicious at a sacrifice. Therefore, lest he should do what is inauspicious\nat the sacrifice, he should recite, just as it is recited by the _Ri_ k, \'for\nHot _ri_ , the all-knowing, him!\' [He continues], \'Performing well this\nsacrifice!\' for he, Agni, is indeed a good performer of the sacrifice: for\nthis reason he says, \'performing well this sacrifice.\' She (gayatri, or the\nearth) sided with the gods, and the gods thereupon were victorious and the\nAsuras were defeated: and verily he for whom, knowing this, they recite this\n(verse), is himself victorious and his adversaries are defeated.\n\n1:4:1:3636\\. He therefore recites this, the eighth samidheni). This, indeed,\nis peculiarly a gayatri verse, since it is of eight syllables that the gayatri\n(metre) consists: for this reason he recites the eighth (samidheni).\n\np. 112\n\n1:4:1:3737\\. Here now some people place the two (dhayyas) additional kindling\nverses before (the eighth samidheni), arguing, \'The two dhayyas 1 mean food:\nthis edible food we place in front (or, in the mouth, mukhata _h_ ).\' But let\nhim not do this: for with him who inserts the additional verses before (the\neighth), the latter (the eighth) is clearly out of its place 2, since in that\ncase it (and the succeeding verse) become the tenth and eleventh verses. With\nhim, on the other hand, for whom they recite this as the eighth (kindling\nverse), it is indeed in its proper place: let him therefore insert the two\nadditional verses after (the ninth).\n\n1:4:1:3838\\. [He recites the ninth kindling verse]: \'He who is kindled at the\ncult\'--the cult (adhvara), doubtless, is the sacrifice: \'he who is kindled at\nthe sacrifice\' he thereby says;--\'Agni, the bright, the laudable,\' for he is\nboth bright and laudable;--\'the flaming-locked, him we adore!\' for when he is\nkindled, his locks, as it were, flame. Previously to (the beginning of the\ntenth verse), \'O Agni, worshipped, thou art lit!\' let him (the Adhvaryu) put\non\n\np. 113\n\nall the kindling-sticks with the exception of the one stick (which is to be\nput on at the after-offerings 1); for it is now that the Hot _ri_ completes\n(the kindling); and what then is left of the kindling-sticks, other than the\none stick, that is left (unused altogether); and what is left (unused) of the\nsacrifice, that is left for his (the sacrificer\'s) spiteful enemy: let him,\ntherefore, previously to this (verse), put on all the samidhs, save one.\n\n1:4:1:3939\\. [He continues]: \'Adore, good worshipper, the gods!\' worship\n(adhvara) doubtless means sacrifice: \'adore the gods, good sacrificer,\' he\nthereby says;--\'Oblation-bearer, sure, art thou!\' for he, Agni, is indeed the\nbearer of oblations: for this reason he says \'oblation-bearer, sure, art\nthou.\'\n\n[He recites the last samidheni]: \'Make offerings! do reverence! Him, Agni,\nwhile the cult proceeds, for your oblation-bearer choose!\' by this (verse) he\nurges them on: \'make offerings and worship! do this for (the accomplishment)\nof whatever desire you kindled him!\' this is what he thereby means to say.\n\'Him, Agni, while the cult proceeds,\' he says, because cult means sacrifice:\nhence he thereby says, \'him, Agni, whilst the sacrifice proceeds;\'--\'for your\noblation-bearer choose!\' for he, Agni, is indeed the oblation-bearer, and for\nthis reason he says \'for your oblation-bearer choose (him)!\'\n\n40\\. This tristich, containing (the word) \'cult (adhvara),\' he thus recites.\nFor once when the gods were engaged in sacrificing, their rivals, the Asuras,\nwished to injure (dhurv, dhvar) them; but, though desirous of injuring them,\nthey were\n\np. 114\n\nunable to injure them and were foiled: for this reason the sacrifice is called\nadhvara (\'not damaged, uninterrupted\'); and for whomsoever, that knows this,\nthey recite this tristich containing (the word) adhvara (\'cult, sacrifice\'),\nhis rival, though desirous of injuring him, is foiled; and he, (the\nsacrificer), moreover, gains as much as one gains by offering a Soma-sacrifice\n1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[100:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_276) That is, by uttering \'Om!\' after each verse. The\nrecitation of the first verse is preceded by the mystic words \'Hi\xe1\xb9\x85 bhur bhuva\n_h_ svar om!\' \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. I, 2, 3. Both syllables \'hi\xe1\xb9\x85\' and \'om\' are\nessential elements in the recitation of Saman hymns, See II, 2, 4, 11 seq.\n\n[101:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_277) The particles pra and a were apparently used in\nphrases wishing one a safe journey and return (cf. Ait. Br. 3, 26, with Haug\'s\nnote). The first samidheni begins, \'pra vo va\xc2\xb4ga abhidyava _h_ \' (forth go\nyour viands, heavenward); and the second \'agna a\xc2\xb4 yahi vitaye\' (come hither,\nAgni, to the feast!). It is from these verses that the above symbolical\nexplanation is derived. Cf. Taitt. S. II, 5, 7, 3 [pra _k_ ina _m_ reto\ndhiyate--prati _k_ i _h_ pra _g_ a _g_ ayante].\n\n[102:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_278) The following is a connected translation (as\nliteral as possible, if not elegant) of the eleven samidhenis, or kindling\nverses, in the same octosyllabic metre as the original. The first and eleventh\nverses are recited three times; and when at the end of each verse the Hot _ri_\npronounces the syllable o _m_ , the Adhvaryu throws a stick (samidh) into the\nfire,--up to the eighth verse, at the end of which the tenth stick is thrown\nin. At the end of the ninth verse five of the remaining six sticks are thrown\ninto the fire. The throwing of the first stick is accompanied by the\nsacrificer pronouncing the dedicatory formula (tyaga), \'For Agni this, not for\nme!\'\n\n1\\. Forth go your viands, heavenward,  \nIn havis rich; with buttered (spoon)  \nHe nears the gods, wishful of bliss.\n\n2\\. Come hither, Agni, to the feast;  \nInvoked for the offering-gift,  \nAs Hot _ri_ on the barhis sit!\n\n3\\. With samidhs thee, O A\xe1\xb9\x85giras,  \nWith butter we exhilarate:  \nShine forth, O youngest, brilliantly!\n\n4\\. Agni, do thou obtain for us  \nThat region wide and glorious,  \nThat great and mighty one, O God!\n\n5\\. Praiseworthy he, adorable,  \nVisible through the veil of gloom,  \nAgni, the mighty one, is lit.\n\n6\\. The mighty Agni is lit up,  \nYea, as a horse that bears the gods:  \nWith offerings him they glorify.\n\n7\\. O mighty one! we mighty men  \nDo kindle thee, the mighty one,--  \nO Agni, thee that brightly shines. p. 103\n\n8\\. Agni we choose as messenger,  \nAs Hot _ri_ the all-knowing,--him,  \nPerforming well this sacrifice.\n\n9\\. He who is kindled at the cult,  \nAgni, the bright, the laudable,  \nThe flaming-locked, him we adore.\n\n10\\. O Agni, worshipped, thou art lit:  \nAdore, good worshipper, the gods!  \nOblation-bearer, sure, art thou.\n\n11\\. Make offerings! do reverence!--  \nHim, Agni, while the cult proceeds,  \nFor your oblation-bearer choose!\n\n[103:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_279) See further on, par. 22 seq.\n\n[103:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_280) Inasmuch as Agni, whilst coming to the sacrifice,\ngoes away from the gods. Say.\n\n[103:3](sbe1217.htm#fr_281) In the Taitt. S. II, 5, 7, 3-4 also va _g_ a is in\nthe first place rendered by \'food,\' while afterwards it is identified with the\nmonths (i.e. the coursers? gamana _s_ ila, Say.); as abhidyava _h_ (in the\nsense of \'shining in both directions,\' i.e. in the form of the waxing and\nwaning moon, Say.) is referred to the half-moons.\n\n[104:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_282) To this important legend attention was first drawn\nby Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. I, 170 seq. (cf. also Ind. Streifen, I, p. 13;\nJ. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, II, p. 402). It was pointed out by Weber that this\nlegend distinguishes three successive stages of the eastward migration of the\nBrahmanical Hindus. In the first place the settlements of the \xc3\x82ryans had\nalready been extended from the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ab (where they were settled in the\ntimes of the hymns of the Rig-veda) as far as the Sarasvati. They thence\npushed forward, led by the Videgha Mathava and his priest, according to our\nlegend, as far east as the river Sadanira (that is, \'she that is always filled\nwith water\'), which, according to Saya _n_ a, is another name for the Karatoya\n(the modern Kurattee, on which Bograh lies), which formed the eastern boundary\nof the Videhas; or more probably the Ga _n_ _d_ aki (the modern Gunduck, a\nnoble river which falls into the Ganges opposite Patna, and) which formed the\nboundary between the Kosalas and the Videhas (cf. par. 17). It would appear\nfrom our legend, that for some time the Aryans did not venture to cross this\nriver; but at the time of the author the country to the east of it had long\nbeen occupied by them. Saya _n_ a takes the hero of the legend to be Videgha,\nthe Madhava or son of Madhu; but Videgha, an older form of Videha, is more\nprobably intended here (as Weber takes it) for the name of that people and\ncountry (corresponding to the modern Tirhut). The Agni Vai _s_ vanara (or Agni\nwho is common to all men) of our legend Professor Weber considers a\npersonification of Brahmanical worship and civilisation and the destructive\neffects of their extension.\n\n[105:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_283) Or, according to Saya _n_ a, he was then in the\nSarasvati, plunged into the river in order to quench the heat produced by\nAgni.\n\n[106:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_284) That is to say, it is not affected by the heat of\nthe summer, as the other rivers, but rushes along as rapidly and as well-\nfilled as ever.\n\n[106:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_285) _G_ igati is taken by Saya _n_ a in the sense of\n\'he sings, praises.\' Our author, on the other hand, seems to interpret it by\n\'he conquers ( _g_ i);\' see, however, next note.\n\n[106:3](sbe1217.htm#fr_286) The text has, \'Sa hi devan _g_ igishati sa hi\ndevan _g_ iga _m_ sati.\' The Ka _n_ va recension has the same reading, except\nthat it omits \'hi\' p. 107 in both cases. Instead of _g_ iga _m_ sati, however,\nsome MSS., as well as Saya _n_ a, read _g_ igha _m_ sati (\'he wishes to\nconquer, or beat, the gods\'), probably an old corruption, easily accounted for\nby the circumstance that _g_ igishati is the regular desiderative of _g_ i,\n\'to conquer,\' though it also occurs in some passages as the desiderative of\nga, \'to go.\' Saya _n_ a, however, though he reads _g_ igha _m_ sati, here\nallows to the root han (with Naigh. 2, 14) the meaning of \'to go.\' Cf.

Saya _n_ a.\n\n[107:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_288) That is, vi-itaye, \'for going asunder,\' a fanciful\nanalysis of the word viti; the correct rendering is \'for the meal or food,\'\n\'for the feast.\'\n\n[107:3](sbe1217.htm#fr_289) Havyadati, the correct meaning of the word is \'the\ngiving of oblations.\'\n\n[108:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_290) Rig-veda I, 31, 1, he is called the first of the\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras.\n\n[108:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_291) The fire which has just been kindled is frequently\ncalled the youngest (yavish _th_ a). Saya _n_ a takes it as \'the ever young.\'\nSee also the legend regarding the three Agnis who preceded the present Agni in\nthe office of divine Hot _ri_ , I, 2, 3, 1; 3, 3, 13.\n\n[109:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_292) Vivasasi, Saya _n_ a explains it by prakasaya,\n\'illuminate it;\' but cf. Saya _n_ a on Rig-veda VI, 16, asman a _k_ _kh_ a\nabhigamaya, \'make it (dhanam) come to us.\'\n\n[109:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_293) Suvirya is taken by our author as an adjective,\nco-ordinate with the others; but it is evidently a noun (\'abundance of heroes\'\nor \'manliness, manly power,\' St. Petersburg Dictionary) qualified by the\nadjectives.\n\n[109:3](sbe1217.htm#fr_294) Na is taken by our author as a particle of\nasseveration; though in reality it is a particle of comparison. In later\nSanskrit na is only used as particle of negation.\n\n[110:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_295) V _ri_ shan, \'the male, the vigorous one, the\nbull;\' cf. Max Muller, Translation of Rig-veda Sanhita, I, p. 121 seq.\n\n[110:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_296) \'On the top of Mount Meru lies the city of\nAmaravati, wherein the gods dwell; and beneath Meru lies Iravati, the city of\nthe Asuras: between these two lies the earth.\' Saya _n_ a.\n\n[111:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_297) Cf. the corresponding passage in Taitt. S. II, 5,\n11, 8, where Daivya is given as the name of the messenger of the Asuras.\n\n[111:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_298) That is to say, instead of \'Hotara _m_ vi _s_\nvavedasam,\' they recite \'Hota yo vi _s_ vavedasa _h_ ;\' for the reason that\nHotaram (accusative of hot _ri_ ) might be understood to be \'hota aram,\' aram,\n\'enough,\' being a particle implying a prohibition. Our author, however,\npromptly sets his face against this application of human reasoning to an\ninspired text.\n\n[112:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_299) Whenever thirteen kindling verses are recited\ninstead of eleven (or counting the repetitions of the first and last verses,\nseventeen instead of fifteen), the two verses Rig-veda III, 27, 5 and 6 are\ninserted according to our author after the ninth, and according to others\nbefore the eighth, samidheni. They are called dhayya, probably derived from\ndha, \'to put, add,\' whilst those ritualists whose practice is here rejected\napparently connect the word with the root dha (dhe), \'to suck.\'\n\n[112:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_300) According to Saya _n_ a, because it no longer\noccupies the eighth place for which it is specially appropriate on account of\nits being, according to our author, \'peculiarly a gayatri (eight-syllabled)\nverse.\' This reasoning is far from satisfactory, since the two dhayyas (Rig-\nveda III, 27, 5 and 6) are also gayatri verses.\n\n[113:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_301) See I, 8, 2, 3.\n\n[114:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_302) Saumya adhvara is the common designation of the\nsolemn Soma-sacrifice; hence, our author argues, the word adhvara is here used\nfor sacrifice (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) with a view to insure to this offering the\nefficacy of a Soma-sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 2.
