Speech is Agni, sight that \xc3\x82ditya (sun), mind the moon, hearing the Di _s_\n(quarters): this is the prahita _m_ sa _m_ yoga 2, the union of the deities as\nsent forth. These deities (Agni, &c.) are thus in the body, but their\n(phenomenal) appearance yonder is among the deities--this was intended.\n\n3\\. And Hira _n_ yadat Vaida also, who knew this (and who by his knowledge had\nbecome Hira _n_ yagarbha or the universal spirit), said: 'Whatever they do not\ngive to me, they do not possess themselves.' I know the prahita _m_ sa _m_\nyoga, the union of the deities, as entered into the body 3. This is it.\n\np. 209\n\n4\\. To him who knows this all creatures, without being constrained, offer\ngifts.\n\n5\\. That breath is (to be called) sattya (the true), for sat is breath, ti is\nfood, yam is the sun 1. This is threefold, and threefold the eye also may be\ncalled, it being white, dark, and the pupil. He who knows why true is true\n(why sattya is sattya), even if he should speak falsely, yet what he says is\ntrue.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[208:1](sbe01206.htm#fr_517) All these are plays on words, pratar being\nderived from pratayi, sayam from samagat. The real object, however, is to show\nthat breath, which is the uktha, which is the worshipper, is endowed with\ncertain qualities, viz. time, speech, &c.\n\n[208:2](sbe01206.htm#fr_518) The meaning is, that the four deities, Agni,\n\xc3\x82ditya, Moon, and the Di _s_ proceed from their own places to dwell together\nin the body of man, and that this is called the prahita _m_ sa _m_ yoga _h_.\nPrahit is explained as prahita, placed, sent. It is probably formed from hi,\nnot from dha. Prahito _h_ sa _m_ yoganam is the name of a Saman, Ind. Stud.\nIII, 225. As Devas or gods they appear each in its own place. The whole\npassage is very obscure.\n\n[208:3](sbe01206.htm#fr_519) All this is extremely obscure, possibly\nincorrect. For yam, unless it refers to some other word, we expect yan. For\ndadyu _h_ one expects dadyat. What is intended is that Hira _n_ yadat had p.\n209 through meditation acquired identity with the universal spirit, and that\ntherefore he might say that whatever was not surrendered to him did not really\nbelong to anybody. On Hiranyadat, see Ait. Brahm. III, 6.\n\n[209:1](sbe01206.htm#fr_520) Cf. _Kh_. Up. VIII, 3, 5.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 6](sbe01207.htm)\n\n"
