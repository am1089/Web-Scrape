The Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O Saumya! Just now you have spoken of the fight\nfor five thousand years, in that great ocean, between Bhagavan S\xc2\x92auri and\nMadhu Kai _t_ abha. How was it that the two greatly powerful Danavas,\ninvincible of the Devas came to be born there? And why did Bhagavan Hari kill\nthem? O highly intelligent one! Kindly describe that greatly wonderful event.\nWe all are extremely eager to hear it, and you are the great Pundit and\nspeaker, present before us. It is our good luck that we have come across you\nhere. As the contact with the illiterate is very painful, so the contact with\nthe literate is very happy like nectar. The animals in this world live like\nilliterates; they eat, call for their nature, void urines and faeces, and know\nwonderfully well the sexual intercourse. Only they want discriminative\nknowledge of right and wrong, of the real\n\n\n\n\n\nand unreal, and a knowledge of discrimination, leading to Mok _s_ a or final\nliberation; this is the only point of difference. Therefore the persons that\nhave no liking to hear of Bhagavata and books like it, are like beasts; there\nis no doubt in this. Behold! Deer and some other animals can enjoy well the\nsense of hearing like men; and the serpents, though wanting in the organ of\nhearing, become charmed quite like men, as if tasting the pleasure of hearing\nsweet sounds. Verily out of the five organs of perception the organ of hearing\nand the organ of sight are benefitting, for the knowledge of things arises\nfrom hearing and the heart is pleased by seeing. Therefore the Pundits divide\nin three classes, the objects of hearing, as :-- (1) Sattvik, (2) Rajasik and\n(3) Tamasik. The Vedas and other S\xc2\x92astras are Sattvik; the literature Sahitya\nis the Rajasik and war news and finding fault with others is Tamasik. The wise\npersons again sub-divide the Sattvik in three sub-classes :-- good, middling\nand worst. That which gives Mok _s_ a is good or excellent; that which gives\nHeavens is middling and that which gives this worldly pleasure is worst. In\nthe same way, the literature Sahitya is of three kinds :-- That which\ndescribes the people to live with their legitimate wives is the best; which\ndescribes about prostitutes is the middling; and that which makes people live\nwith other's wives is the worst.\n\n\n\nThe seers of Sastras, the learned men divide the subjects of the Tamasik\nhearing into three classes :-- That in which fight with the enemies is\ndescribed is best; where the fight, as of the Pandavas, with the enemies out\nof hatred, ill-feeling, is described is middling; and that where fighting is\ndescribed without any cause is worst. Therefore, O highly intelligent one!\nHearing the Pura _n_ as is far superior to hearing other S\xc2\x92astras, for thereby\nsins are destroyed, intellect is increased and Pu _n_ yam (good merits) is\nstored. So, O intelligent one! Kindly describe to us, the Pura _n_ as,\nfulfilling all the requirements of life, that you heard before from the mouth\nof Kri _sn_ a Dvaipayana\xc2\x94. Hearing these words of the Ri _s_ is, Suta said :--\n\xc2\x93O highly fortunate ones! When you all are desirous to hear the Pura _n_ as\nand I am ready to tell them, then both of us are blessed on the surface of the\nearth\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\nIn days of yore, in the time of Pralaya (universal dissolution) when the three\nlokas and the entire universe dissolved in water, when the Devadeva Janardana\nwas lying asleep on the bed of Ananta, the thousand headed serpent, arose from\nthe was of the ear of Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, the two very powerful Daityas Madhu\nand Kaitabha; they grew in the waters of the ocean and played around in the\nwaters and thus passed some of their time. Once, on a time, when the two huge\nbodied Danavas were playing with each other like two brothers, they thought\nthat the general\n\n\n\np. 21\n\n\n\nrule of the universe is that no effect takes place without a cause and nothing\ncan rest without the receptacle thereof. But we cannot understand what is our\nreceptacle or who is resting on us. Whereon rests this pleasant expanse of\nwide ocean? Who was it that created this? How was this created? Why are we\nliving here merged within the water? Who created us? and who are our father\nand mother. Nothing of a these we know. Thus thinking, when they could not\ncome to any conclusion, Kaitabha spoke to Madhu, beside him, within the waters\n:-- \xc2\x93O Brother! It seems to me the great immoveable force that makes us rest\nin this water is the cause of all. This whole mass of water, too, pervaded by\nthat force, rests on that; that Highest Devi must be the Cause of us\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\nWhen the two Asuras, merged in this thought, understood this, they heard in\nthe air the beautiful Vagvija (the seed mantra of Vak, the speech, the Devi\nSarasvati). They then began to pronounce repeated the Vagvija mantra and\npractised it with the great steadfastness. Next they saw, risen high up in the\nair, the auspicious lightning and thought that certainly our mantra that we\nare repeating has made Herself visible in this form of light and thus we have\nseen certainly in the air, the sagu _n_ a form (form with attributes) of\nSarasvati, the goddess of Speech. Thus thinking in their minds they, without\nany food, with their minds controlled, constantly thought of that, with their\nwhole mind collected on that, and repeating and meditating the mantra became\none with that. Thus they passed one thousand years in practising that great\ntapas; when the Highest \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti became pleased with them and seeing the\ntwo Danavas, steadfast in the practice of Tapas, tired, address them,\ninvisibly in the way of celestial voice thus :-- \xc2\x93O two Danavas! I am\nexceedingly pleased with your tapasya; so ask boon whatever you desire; I will\ngrant it.\xc2\x94 Hearing, then, the celestial voice, thus the two Danavas said :--\n\xc2\x93O Devi! O Suvrate! Grant us that we will die when _we_ will.\xc2\x94 Hearing this,\nVagdevi said :-- \xc2\x93O two Danavas! Certain by My grace, you two will die when\nyou will and you two brothers will be invincible of all the Suras and Asuras.\nThere is no doubt in this\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\nSuta said :-- When the Devi granted them this boon, the two Danavas, puffed up\nwith pride, began to play with the aquatic animals in the ocean. O Brahmins!\nSome days thus passed away when the two powerful Danavas saw the Brahma, the\nPrajapati, seated on the lotus of navel of Hari. Doubt came on their minds and\nthey told him with a view to fight :-- \xc2\x93O Suvrata! Either fight with us, or\nleave off this lotus seat and go any where you like. If you be so weak, this\nauspicious lotus seat not fit for you. For this should be enjoyed by the\nheroes. So if you\n\n\n\np. 22\n\n\n\nbe a coward, leave it quickly\xc2\x94. Hearing these words of the Danavas, Prajapati,\nengaged in the practice of Tapasya, saw the two great powerful heroes and\nbegan to think anxiously \xc2\x93What should be done now\xc2\x94 and waited there.\n\n\n\nThus ends the sixth chapter of the first Skandha on the preparation for war by\nMadhu Kaitabha in the Mahapura _n_ a S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7](bk01ch07.htm)\n\n"
