And there is permission of all food, (only) in the case of danger of\nlife; on account of this being shown (by scripture).\n\nIn the colloquy of the pra _n_ as the _Kh_ andogas record, 'To him who knows\nthis there is nothing which is not food' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 1, 2); and the Va _g_\nasaneyins,' By him nothing is eaten that is not food, nothing is received that\nis not food' (B _ri_. Up. VI, 1, 14). The sense of the two passages is that\nanything may be eaten by him.--A doubt here arises whether the texts enjoin\nthe permission of eating anything\n\np. 310\n\nas an auxiliary to knowledge--as calmness of mind, &c., are--or mention them\nfor the purpose of glorification.--The purvapakshin maintains that the\npassages are injunctions because thus we gain an instruction which causes a\nspecial kind of activity. What, therefore, the text teaches is the non-\noperation of a definite rule, in so far as auxiliary to the knowledge of the\npra _n_ as in proximity to which it is taught. But this interpretation implies\nthe sublation of the scriptural rules as to the distinction of lawful and\nunlawful food!--Such sublation, we reply, is possible, because the present\ncase is one of general rule and special exception. The prohibition of doing\nharm to any living creature is sublated by the injunction of the killing of\nthe sacrificial animal; the general rule which distinguishes between such\nwomen as may be approached and such as may not, is sublated by the text\nprescribing, with reference to the knowledge of the Vamadevya, that no woman\nis to be avoided ('Let him avoid no woman, that is the vow,' _Kh_. Up. II, 13,\n2); analogously the passage which enjoins, with reference to the knowledge of\nthe pra _n_ as, the eating of all food may sublate the general rule as to the\ndistinction of lawful and unlawful food.\n\nTo this we reply as follows. The permission to eat any food whatever is not\nenjoined, since the passages do not contain any word of injunctive power; for\nthe clause, 'To him who knows this there is nothing,' &c., expresses only\nsomething actually going on. And where the conception of an injunction does\nnot naturally arise we may not assume one from the mere wish of something\ncausing a special line of activity. Moreover the text says that 'for him who\nknows this there is nothing that is not food,' only after having said that\neverything even unto dogs and the like is food for the Pra _n_ a. Now food\nsuch as dogs and the like cannot be enjoyed by the human body; but all this\ncan be thought of as food of the Pra _n_ a. From this it follows that the\npassage is an arthavada meant to glorify the knowledge of the food of the Pra\n_n_ a, not an injunction of the permission of all food.--This the Sutra\nindicates in the words, 'and there is permission of all food\n\np. 311\n\nin danger of life.' That means: Only in danger of life, in cases of highest\nneed, food of any kind is permitted to be eaten. 'On account of scripture\nshowing this.' For scripture shows that the _ri_ shi _K_ akraya _n_ a when in\nevil plight proceeded to eat unlawful food. In the brahma _n_ a beginning,\n'when the Kurus had been destroyed by hailstones,' it is told how the _ri_ shi\n_K_ akraya _n_ a having fallen into great wretchedness ate the beans half\neaten by a chief, but refused to drink what had been offered on the ground of\nits being a mere leaving; and explained his proceeding as follows: 'I should\nnot have lived if I had not eaten them; but water I can drink wherever I\nlike.' And again on the following day he ate the stale beans left by himself\nand another person. Scripture, in thus showing how the stale leaving of a\nleaving was eaten, intimates as its principle that in order to preserve one's\nlife when in danger one may eat even unlawful food. That, on the other hand,\nin normal circumstances not even a man possessing knowledge must do this,\nappears from _K_ akraya _n_ a refusing to drink. From this it follows that the\npassage, 'For to him who knows this,' &c., is an arthavada.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[309:1](sbe38236.htm#fr_197) The passage quoted occurs in the Veda under the\nheading of the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa. But as Pushan has no share in the\nfundamental form of that sacrifice, we conclude that the injunction implied in\nthe passage is valid for those vik _ri_ tis of the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa in\nwhich offerings are made to Pushan.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 29](sbe38238.htm)\n\n"
