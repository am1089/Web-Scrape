And on account of the designation (of the Self as the agent) in actions.\nIf not so, there would be change of grammatical expression.\n\nBecause in the text 'Knowledge performs the sacrifice, it performs all works'\n(Taitt. Up. II, 5) the Self is designated as the agent in all worldly and\nVedic works, for this reason also the Self must be held to be an agent. And\nshould it be said that the word 'knowledge' in that text denotes not the Self,\nbut the internal organ or buddhi, we point out that in that case there would\nbe a change of grammatical expression, that is to say, as the buddhi is the\ninstrument of action, the text would exhibit the instrumental case instead of\nthe nominative case 'by knowledge, and so on' (vi _g \xc3\xb1_anena instead of vi _g\n\xc3\xb1_anam).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 36.
