And like the Sanatsu _g_ atiya, it\nappears here for the first time in an English, or, indeed, it is believed, in\nany European garb. It forms part of the A _s_ vamedha Parvan of the\nMahabharata, and is contained in thirty-six chapters of that Parvan. These\nchapters--being chapters XVI to LI--together with all the subsequent chapters\nof the A _s_ vamedha Parvan, form by themselves what in some of our copies is\ncalled the Anugita Parvan-a title which affords a parallel to the title\nBhagavadgita Parvan, which we have already referred to. The Anugita is not now\na work of any very great or extensive reputation. But we do find some few\nquotations from it in the Bhashyas of Sa _n_ kara _k_ arya, and one or two in\nthe Sa _n_ khya-sara of Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana Bhikshu, to which reference will be made\nhereafter. And it is included in the present volume, partly because it affords\nan interesting, glimpse of sundry old passages of the Upanishad literature in\na somewhat modified, and presumably later, form; and partly, perhaps I may say\nmore especially, because it professes to be a sort of continuation, or rather\nrecapitulation, of the Bhagavadgita. At the very outset of the work, we read,\nthat, after the great fratricidal war of the Mahabharata was over, and the Pa\n_nd_ avas had become sole and complete masters of their ancestral kingdom, K\n_ri_ sh _n_ a and Ar _g_ una--the two interlocutors in the\nBhagavadgita\\--happened to take a stroll together in the great magical palace\nbuilt for the Pa _nd_ avas by the demon Maya. In the course of the\nconversation which they held on the occasion, K _ri_ sh _n_ a communicated to\nAr _g_ una his wish to return to his own people at Dvaraka, now that the\nbusiness which had called\n\np. 198\n\nhim away from them was happily terminated. Ar _g_ una, of course, was unable\nto resist the execution of this wish; but he requested Krishna, before leaving\nfor Dvaraka, to repeat the instruction which had been already conveyed to him\non 'the holy field of Kurukshetra,' but which had gone out of his 'degenerate\nmind.' K _ri_ sh _n_ a thereupon protests that he is not equal to a verbatim\nrecapitulation of the Bhagavadgita, but agrees, in lieu of that, to impart to\nAr _g_ una the same instruction in other words, through the medium of a\ncertain 'ancient story'--or puratana itihasa. And the instruction thus\nconveyed constitutes what is called the Anugita, a name which is in itself an\nembodiment of this anecdote.\n\nNow the first question which challenges investigation with reference to this\nwork is, if we may so call it, the fundamental one-how much is properly\nincluded under the name? The question is not one quite easy of settlement, as\nour authorities upon it are not all reconcilable with one another. In the\ngeneral list of contents of the A _s_ vamedha Parvan, which is given at the\nend of that Parvan in the edition printed at Bombay, we read that the first\nsection is the Vyasa Vakya, the second the Samvartamaruttiya. With neither of\nthese have we aught to do here. The list then goes on thus: 'Anugita,\nVasudevagamana, Brahma _n_ a Gita, Guru _s_ ishyasamvada, Uttankopakhyana,'\nand so forth. With the later sections, again, we arc not here concerned. Now\nlet us compare this list with the list which may be obtained from the titles\nof the chapters in the body of the work itself. With the sixteenth chapter,\nthen, of the A _s_ vamedha Parvan, begins what is here called the Anugita\nParvan; and that chapter and the three following chapters are described as the\nsixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth chapters respectively of\nthe Anugita Parvan, which forms part of the A _s_ vamedha Parvan. The title of\nthe twentieth chapter contains a small, but important, addition. It runs thus,\n'Such is the twentieth chapter of the Anugita Parvan, forming part of the A\n_s_ vamedha Parvan--being the Brahma Gita' This form is continued down to the\nthirty-fourth chapter, only Brahma _n_ a\n\np. 199\n\n[paragraph continues] Gita being substituted for Brahma Gita. At the close of\nthe thirty-fifth chapter, there is another alteration caused by the\nsubstitution of Guru _s_ ishyasamvada for Brahma _n_ a Gita; and this\ncontinues down to the fifty-first chapter, where the thread of the narrative\nis again taken up--the philosophical parenthesis, if I may so say, having come\nto an end. With the fifty-first chapter our present translation also ends. Now\nit appears from the above comparison., that the list of contents set out above\nis accurate, save in so far as it mentions Vasudevagamana as a distinct\nsection of the A _s_ vamedha Parvan. No such section seems to be in existence.\nAnd there appears to be nothing in the A _s_ vamedha Parvan to which that\ntitle could be appropriately allotted. The edition printed at Madras agrees in\nall essential particulars with the Bombay edition; with this difference, that\neven at the close of the twentieth chapter, the name is Brahma _n_ a Gita, and\nnot Brahma Gita as it is in the Bombay edition. The Calcutta edition also\nagrees in these readings. Turning now to a MS. procured for me by my excellent\nfriend Professor \xc3\x82ba _g_ i Vish _n_ u Kathava _t_ e at Ahmedabad, and bearing\ndate the 15th of Phalguna Vadya 1823, Sunday, we find there at the end of the\nA _s_ vamedha Parvan a list of contents like that which we have seen in the\nprinted edition. The relevant portion of that list is as follows:\n'Samvartamaruttiya, Anugita, Guru _s_ ishyasa _m_ vada, and Uttankopakhyana.'\nHere we find neither the erroneous entry of Vasudevagamana, nor the correct\nentry of Brahma Gita, which are both contained in the other list. In another\nMS. which I have now before me, and which has been lent me by Professor Bha\n_nd_ arkar, who purchased it in Puna for the Government of Bombay--in this\nMS., which contains the commentary of Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, the earlier\nchapters are described not as chapters of the Anugita Parvan, but of the\nAnugita contained in the A _s_ vamedha Parvan, and they are numbered there as\nthey are numbered in our translation, not continuously with the numbering of\nthe previous chapters of the A _s_ vamedha Parvan. At the close of chapter IV,\nwe have an explicit statement that the Anugita ends there. Then the Brahma\nGita begins. And the first chapter is\n\np. 200\n\ndescribed as a chapter of the Brahma Gita in the A _s_ vamedha Parvan. The\nnumbering of each of these chapters of the Brahma Gita is not given in. the\ncopy before us--the titles and descriptions of the various chapters being\nthroughout incomplete. Some of the later chapters are described as chapters of\nthe Brahma Gita, and some as chapters of the Brahma _n_ a Gita; but this\ndiscrepancy is probably to be put to the account of the particular copyist who\nwrote out the copy used by us. With what is chapter XX in our numbering the\nGuru _s_ ishyasa _m_ vada begins. This MS. omits all reference to any Anugita\nParvan, and fails to number the various chapters. Its list of sections agrees\nwith that in the Bombay edition. It bears no date.\n\nSo much for what may be described as our primary sources of information on\nthis subject. Let us now glance at the secondary sources. And, first, Nilaka\n_nth_ a in commenting on what is, according to his numbering, chapter XV,\nstanza 43, apparently distinguishes that chapter from what he speaks of as the\nBrahma _n_ a Gita and Guru _s_ ishyasa _m_ vada, which he implies follow after\nthat chapter--thus indicating that he accepted in substance the tradition re\ncorded in the passages We have already set forth, viz. that the first four\nchapters of our translation form the Anugita, the next fifteen the Brahma _n_\na Gita, and the last seventeen the Guru _s_ ishyasa _m_ vada. This is also the\nview of Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. At the close of his gloss on chapter IV, he\ndistinctly states that the Anugita ends at that chapter; and again at the\nclose of the gloss on chapter XIX, he explicitly says that the Brahma _n_ a\nGita ends there. He also adds the following interesting observation: 'The\nfeminine form (Gita, namely) is used in consequence of (the word) Upanishad\nbeing feminine.' The full title of that part of the Mahabharata would then be,\naccording to this remark of Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, 'the Upanishads sung by the\nBrahma _n_ a,' a title parallel to that of the Bhagavadgita, 'the Upanishads\nsung by the Deity.' It is to be further remarked, that the last chapter of the\nGuru _s_ ishyasa _m_ vada is called in this commentary the eighteenth chapter\nof the Guru _s_ ishyasa _m_ vada, a fact which seems to indicate that Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra either found\n\np. 201\n\nin the MS. which he used, or himself established, a separate numbering for the\nchapters in the several sections 1 of which the A _s_ vamedha Parvan is made\nup.\n\nAlthough the information here set out from these various sources is not easily\nto be harmonised in all its parts, the preponderance of testimony seems to he\nin favour of regarding the portion of the A _s_ vamedha Parvan embraced in our\ntranslation as containing three distinct sections, viz. the Anugita, the\nBrahma _n_ a Gita, and the Guru _s_ ishyasa _m_ vada. And some indirect\nsupport may be derived for this conclusion, from one or two other\ncircumstances. In the Sa _n_ khya-sara of Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana Bhikshu--a work which,\nas we shall see in the sequel, expressly mentions the Anugita\\--we have a\npassage cited as from the 'Bharata 2' which coincides almost precisely with a\npassage occurring at chapter XXVII of our translation (see p. 335). And, in\nthe Bhashya of _S_ a _n_ kara _k_ arya, on the Bhagavadgita, chapter XV,\nstanza 1, we have a citation as from a 'Pura _n_ a' of a passage which\ncoincides pretty closely with one which occurs at chapter XX of our\ntranslation (see [p. 313](sbe0847.htm#page_313)). If the discrepancies between\nthe quotations as given by Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana Bhikshu and _S_ a _n_ kara, and the\npassages occurring in our text, may be treated merely as various readings-and\nthere is nothing inherently improbable in this being the case-it may be fairly\ncontended, that neither _S_ a _n_ kara nor Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana Bhikshu would have used\nthe vague expressions, 'a Pura _n_ a,' or even 'the Bharata,' if they could\nhave correctly substituted in lieu of them the specific name Anugita. And\nthis, it may be said, is a contention of some weight, when it is remembered,\nthat both _S_ a _n_ kara and Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana show, in other parts of their\nwritings, an acquaintance with this very Anugita. If this reasoning is\ncorrect,\n\np. 202\n\nthe conclusion to be derived from it must be, that _S_ a _n_ kara and Vi _g_\n\xc3\xb1ana must have considered the chapters of the A _s_ vamedha Parvan from which\ntheir respective quotations are taken as not forming part of the Anugita.\n\nThe testimony we have thus collected is apparently of considerable weight.\nAgainst it, however, we have to weigh some testimony which appears to me to be\nentitled, upon the whole, to even greater weight. In the Sa _n_ khya-sara of\nVi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana Bhikshu, to which we have already referred, we have two quotations\n1 from the Anugita which are distinctly stated to be taken from that work. The\nfirst occurs in our translation at [p. 332](sbe0852.htm#page_332), the second\nat [p. 313](sbe0847.htm#page_313). Now, if we adopt the conclusion above\nreferred to, regarding the correct titles of the thirty-six chapters which we\nhave translated, it is a mistake to attribute the passages in question to the\nAnugita. They would, on that view, form part of the Guru _s_ ishyasa _m_ vada.\nAgain, in his commentary on the Sanatsu _g_ atiya, _S_ a _n_ kara refers to\nsundry passages which he expressly says are taken from the Anugita, but which\nare not contained in the Anugita as limited by the evidence we have considered\nabove. One of the passages referred to is taken from chapter XI of our\ntranslation, and others are contained in the comments on Sanatsu _g_ atiya I,\n6, and on I, 20 and I, 41 2. It is difficult to resist the conclusion to which\nthis positive evidence leads. One cannot possibly explain this evidence upon\nthe view which we have first stated; while, on the other hand, the points\nwhich apparently support that view are capable of some explanation on the\ntheory that the Anugita includes all the chapters here translated. And that in\nthis wise. The passages which we have referred to as cited by _S_ a _n_ kara\nand Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana from a Purana and from the Bharata may have been actually\ntaken from some other work than the Anugita. Even waiving the fact that the\nreadings are different,--though in regard especially to the quotation given by\n_S_ a _n_ kara it is not one to be entirely lost sight of,--there is this fact\nwhich is of great and almost conclusive weight on such a point as this,\nnamely, that we\n\np. 203\n\nhave many instances of passages common, almost verbatim et literatim, to the\nMahabharata and other works. For one instance, take the very passage on which\na chronological argument has been founded by us in the Introduction to the\nSanatsu _g_ atiya 1. It ought to have been there pointed out, that the stanza\nabout a young man being bound to rise to receive an elderly person, also\noccurs in the Manu Sm _ri_ ti 2 in exactly the same words. The omission to\nnote this circumstance in its proper place in the Introduction to the Sanatsu\n_g_ atiya was due to a mere inadvertence. But the conclusion there hinted at\nwas expressed in very, cautious language, and with many qualifications, out of\nregard to circumstances such as those which we are now considering. Similar\nrepetitions may be pointed out in other places. The passage about the Kshetra\n_g_ \xc3\xb1a and Sattva and their mutual relations (see [p.\n374](sbe0860.htm#page_374)) occurs, as pointed out in the note there,. in at\nleast two other places in the Mahabharata. The passage likewise which occurs\nat Gita, [p. 103](sbe0815.htm#page_103), about the 'hands, feet, &c., on all\nsides,' is one which may be seen, to my own knowledge, in about half a dozen\nplaces in the Mahabharata. Such cases, I believe, may be easily multiplied;\nand they illustrate and are illustrated by Mr. Freeman's proposition\nrespecting the epic age in Greece, to which we have already alluded. It\nfollows, consequently, that the quotations from _S_ a _n_ kara and Vi _g_\n\xc3\xb1ana, to which we have referred above, do not militate very strongly against\nthe final conclusion at which we have arrived. The testimony of the MSS. and\nthe commentators is, no doubt, of considerably greater force. But Nilaka _nth_\na, whatever his merits as an exegete--and even these are often marred by a\npersistent effort to read his own foregone conclusions into the text he\ncomments on Nilaka _nth_ a is but an indifferent authority in the domain of\nhistorical criticism. In his commentary on the Sanatsu _g_ atiya, for\ninstance, he tells us that he has admitted into his text sundry verses which\nwere not in the copy used by _S_ a _n_ kara, and for which he had none but a\nvery modern voucher, and he very naively adds that he has done so\n\np. 204\n\non the principle of collecting all good things to a focus. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra is a very much more satisfactory commentator. But he is not likely to be a\nwriter of much antiquity. I assume, that he must be more recent than Sa _n_\nkara _k_ arya, though I cannot say that I have any very tenable ground for the\nassumption. But assuming that, I think it more satisfactory to adopt Sa _n_\nkara _k_ arya's nomenclature, and to treat the thirty-six chapters here\ntranslated as constituting the Anugita. It is not improbable, if our\nassumption is correct, that the division of the thirty-six chapters in the\nmanner we have seen may have come into vogue after the date of Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana\nBhikshu, who, according to Dr. F. E. Hall, 'lived in all probability in the\nsixteenth or seventeenth century, and whom there is some slight reason for\ncarrying back still further 1.'\n\nDo these thirty-six chapters, then, form one integral work? Are they all the\nwork of one and the same author? These are the questions which next present\nthemselves for consideration. The evidence bearing upon them, however, is, as\nmight be expected, excessively scanty. Of external evidence, indeed, we have\nreally none, barring _S_ a _n_ kara's statement in his commentary on the B\n_ri_ hadara _n_ yaka-upanishad 2 that the verse which he there quotes from the\nAnugita has Vyasa for its author. That statement indicates that _S_ a _n_ kara\naccepted the current tradition of Vyasa's authorship of the Anugita; and such\nacceptance, presumably, followed from his acceptance of the tradition of\nVyasa's authorship of the entire Mahabharata. If that tradition is incorrect,\nand Vyasa is not the author of the Anugita, we have no means of ascertaining\nwho is the author. And as to the tradition in question, it is difficult, in\nthe present state of our materials, to form any satisfactory judgment. We\ntherefore proceed at once to consider whether the Anugita is really one work.\nAnd I must admit at the outset that I find it difficult to answer this\nquestion. There are certainly some circumstances connected with the work which\nmight be regarded as indicating\n\np. 205\n\na different authorship of different parts of it. Thus in an early portion of\nthe work, we find the first personal pronoun is used, where the Supreme Being\nis evidently intended to be signified, and yet the passage is not put into the\nmouth of K _ri_ sh _n_ a, but of the Brahma _n_ a. A similar passage occurs a\nlittle later on also. Now it must be taken to be a somewhat strained\ninterpretation of the words used in the passages in question to suppose that\nthe speaker there used the first personal pronoun, identifying himself for the\nnonce with the Supreme Being 1. Again, in a passage still further on, we have\nthe vocative O Partha! where the person addressed is not Ar _g_ una at all,\nbut the Brahma _n_ a's wife. Now these lapses are susceptible of two\nexplanations--either we are to see in them so many cases of 'Homer nodding,'\nor we may suppose that they are errors occasioned by one writer making\nadditions to the work of a previous writer, without a vivid recollection of\nthe framework of the original composition into which his own work had to be\nset 2. I own, that on balancing the probabilities on the one side and the\nother, my mind rather leans to the hypothesis of one author making a slip in\nthe plexus of his own story within story, rather than the hypothesis of a\ndeliberate interpolator forgetting the actual scheme of the original work into\nwhich he was about to foist his own additions 3. And this the rather, that we\nfind a similar slip towards the very beginning of the work, where we have the\nBrahma _n_ a Ka _s_ yapa addressed as Parantapa, or destroyer of foes--an\nepithet which, I think, is exclusively reserved for Kshatriyas, and is, in any\ncase, a very inappropriate one to apply to a humble seeker for spiritual\nlight. This slip appears to me to be incapable of explanation on any theory of\ninterpolation 4. And hence the other slips above noted can hardly be regarded\nas supporting any such theory. Another circumstance, not indeed bearing\n\np. 206\n\nout that theory, but rendering interpolations possible, deserves to be noted.\nThe scheme of the Anugita certainly lends itself to interpolations. A story\nmight without much difficulty be added to the series of story joined to story\nwhich it contains. Against this, however, it must not be forgotten, that the\n_S_ anti Parvan of the Mahabharata, and the Yogavasish _th_ a exhibit a\nprecisely similar framework of contents, and that the Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ atantra and the\nKathasaritsagara, among other works, follow the same model. And from this fact\nit may, be fairly argued, that while there is, doubtless, room for suspecting\ninterpolations in such cases, there is this to be remembered, that with\nrespect to any particular one of these cases, such suspicion can carry us but\na very short way. And further, it is to be observed, valeat quantum, that the\nconnexion of the several chapters of the Anugita one with the other is not\naltogether a loose one, save at one or two points only, while they are all\nlinked on to the main body of the narrative, only in what we have treated as\nthe last chapter of the Anugita, without any trace of any other connecting\nlink anywhere else. Upon the whole, therefore, we here conclude, though not\nwithout doubt, that the whole of the Anugita is the work of one author.\n\nThe next question to be discussed is the important one of the age of the work.\nThe quotations already given above from Sa _n_ kara _k_ arya's works, and one\nother which is referred to in the note below 1, suffice to show that the\nAnugita must have been some few centuries old in the time of Sa _n_ kara _k_\narya. For whether we treat the Anugita as a part of the original Mahabharata\nor not, it is not likely that such a scholar as _S_ a _n_ kara would have\naccepted the book as a genuine part of the Mahabharata, and as a work of\nVyasa, if it had not been in his day of some respectable antiquity, of\nantiquity sufficient to have thrown the real author into oblivion, and to have\nsubstituted\n\np. 207\n\nin his place Vyasa, who lived at the junction of the Dvapara and Kali ages 1,\nupwards of thirty centuries before the Christian era. The calculation is\navowedly a very rough one, but I think we may, as the result of it, safely fix\nthe third century of the Christian era as the latest date at which the Anugita\ncan have been composed. Let us now endeavour to find out whether we can fix\nthe date as lying within any better defined period. It is scarcely needful to\nsay, that the Anugita dates from a period considerably subsequent to the age\nof the Upanishads. The passages relating to the Pra _n_ asa _m_ vada and so\nforth, which occur originally in the Upanishads, are referred to in the\nAnugita as 'ancient stories'--an indication that the Upanishads had already\ncome to be esteemed as ancient compositions at the date of the latter work. It\nis not necessary, therefore, to go through an elaborate examination of the\nversions of the ancient stories alluded to above, as contained in the\nUpanishads and in the Anugita, more especially because it is possible for us\nto show that the Anugita is later than the Bhagavadgita, which latter work, as\nwe have seen, is later than the Upanishads. And to this point we shall now\naddress ourselves. We have already observed upon the story referred to at the\nopening of this Introduction, which, historically interpreted, indicates the\npriority of the Bhagavadgita to the Anugita. This conclusion is confirmed by\nsundry other circumstances, which we must now discuss in some detail, as they\nare also of use in helping to fix the position of the work in the history of\nSanskrit literature and philosophy. First, then, it seems to me, that the\nstate of society mirrored in the Anugita indicates a greater advance in social\nevolution than we have already seen is disclosed in the Bhagavadgita. Not to\nmention decorations of houses and so forth, which are alluded to in one\npassage of the Anugita, we are here told of royal oppressions, of losses of\nwealth accumulated with great difficulty, and of fierce captivities; we are\ntold, to adapt the language of a modern English poet, of laws grinding the\nweak, for strong men rule the\n\np. 208\n\nlaw; we have references to the casting of images with liquefied iron, and to\nthe use of elephants as vehicles 1; and we meet with protests against the\namusements of music and dancing, and against the occupation of artisans 2.\nTrue it is, that all these indications put together, fail to constitute\naccording to the standard of modern times, would be called a highly artificial\nstate of society. But it seems to me to mark a very perceptible and distinct\nadvance beyond the social condition in which mankind was divided into four\ncastes or classes, with such a division of duties, to put it briefly, as that\nof preparation for a future world, government of this world, agriculture and\ntrade, and service respectively 3. Artisans, it will be observed, are not even\nreferred to in the Bhagavadgita, nor is there any trice of royal oppressions,\nor unequal laws. Then as regards music, it may be noted, that there are\nreferences to it in the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka and Kaushitaki-upanishads 4,\nwithout any indications of disapprobation. The protest against music,\ntherefore, and the sister art of dancing, is probably to be explained as\nevoked by some abuses of the two arts which must have come into prevalence\nabout the time of the composition of the Anugita. A similar protest is found\nrecorded in the Dharma _s_ astras of Manu and \xc3\x82pastamba and Gautama 5. We\nshall consider in the sequel the chronological positions of the Anugita with\nreference to those Dharmasastras. But we have already pointed out that the\nGita stands prior to them both 6.\n\nLook again at the views on caste which are embodied in the Anugita, and the\nBhagavadgita respectively. The reference to the Kshatriya as representing the\nquality of passion, while the Brahma _n_ a represents the quality of goodness\n7, seems to place a considerably larger distance between the Brahma _n_ a, and\nthe Kshatriya than is suggested by the Bhagavadgita, and thus marks an advance\nin the direction of the later doctrine on the subject. And in connexion\n\np. 209\n\nwith this, perhaps, the discrepancy between the reading of the Bhagavadgita at\n[p. 85](sbe0811.htm#page_85), and that of the Anugita at [p.\n255](sbe0831.htm#page_255), is not entirely without significance, though much\nweight would not be due to it, if it stood alone. The expression 'devoted\nroyal sages,' which we find in- the one work, makes way for 'well-read\nKshatriyas who are intent on their own duties' in the other. Again, although\nthe passage at [p. 353](sbe0856.htm#page_353) is undoubtedly susceptible of a\ndifferent interpretation, it seems to me, that the word 'twice-born' there\nemployed, was meant to be interpreted as meaning the Brahma _n_ as, and not\nthe three twice-born castes; and if this interpretation is correct, we have\nhere the very proposition upon the absence of which in the Bhagavadgita we\nhave already made some observations 1. That twice-born in the passage in\nquestion means Brahma _n_ a only, is, of course, not a proved fact. But-having\nregard to the passages noted above and to the passage at [p.\n320](sbe0848.htm#page_320), where reference is made to disparagement of Brahma\n_n_ as--it is not twice-born there--and in the same clause with disparagement\nof gods and Vedas, it seems to me that the interpretation we have suggested\nmust be taken to be the true one. And it is to be further noted, that this\nconclusion is corroborated by a comparison of the passage now under\nconsideration with a passage occurring in the _S_ anti Parvan 2, in the Ra _g_\nadharma section of it, where we read that 'the cow is the first among\nquadrupeds, gold among metals, a mantra among words, and the Brahma _n_ a is\nthe first among bipeds.' The cow and gold occur in the passage in the Anugita\nalso, very near the clause we are now discussing. And it is allowable to\nargue, that reading the two together, twice-born in the Anugita must be\ninterpreted to be synonymous with Brahma _n_ a in the Ra _g_ adharma. And the\nsame conclusion is, to my mind, confirmed indirectly by comparing the clause\n'the twice-born among men' of the Anugita with 'the ruler of men among men of\nthat Bhagavadgita, the teaching of which the former work professes to\nrecapitulate.\n\np. 210\n\nA similar inference seems to be derivable from a comparison of the specific\ndoctrines as to the duties of Brahma _n_ as which are enunciated in the Gita\nand the Anugita. In the latter work, the famous six duties are expressly\nmentioned. We have already argued in our Introduction to the Gita, that a\ncomparison of the teaching of that work upon this point with the teaching of\n\xc3\x82pastamba and Manu shows the former to have been older than the latter. The\nsix duties mentioned in the Anugita are those also mentioned by Manu and\n\xc3\x82pastamba. It follows, therefore, that the Gita is prior to the Anugita also.\nWhether the Anugita is prior or subsequent to Manu and \xc3\x82pastamba, is a\nquestion which will have to be discussed in the sequel.\n\nThe net result of the whole of this comparison appears to me to clearly show\nthe Anugita to be a work of considerably more recent date than the\nBhagavadgita. What interval of time lay between the two, is a most\ninteresting, but also a most difficult, question. The differences we have\nnoted appear to me to indicate a pretty wide interval. If I am right in\nregarding the Gita as a work of what may be called, for practical purposes,\nthe age of the older Upanishads, I am inclined to think that the interval\nbetween the Gita, and the Anugita must have been one of larger extent than\neven three or four centuries. For as we have already pointed put, the\ndescription of the various 'Itihasas' mentioned in the Anugita as 'puratana'--\nancient--points to at least three or four centuries having elapsed between the\nclose of the Upanishad period and the composition of the Anugita. It is\nobvious, however, that this result is not one with which we can rest\nsatisfied. Even if it were more precise and accurate, it would only fix the\nage of the Anugita with reference to the age of another work itself of unknown\nand unascertained date. We must therefore endeavour to compare the Anugita\nwith some other work, the date of which is better known. For this purpose, it\nseems to be not of any great use to refer to the Sankhya and Yoga-sutras,\nalthough it is not improbable that some materials might be forthcoming for a\nuseful comparison between them and the Anugita. Neither the Sa _n_ khya nor\nthe Yoga-sutras can\n\np. 211\n\nbe said to have their ages fixed with even any approach to accuracy. And in\nthe case of the Sa _n_ khya-sutras there is the further difficulty presented\nby the circumstance, that there is room for very serious doubts as to whether\nthe current Sutras are really of the authorship of Kapila, or whoever else was\nthe original founder of the system. With regard to the Yoga, one or two\nobservations from a different point of view may not, however, be entirely out\nof place. At [p. 248](sbe0831.htm#page_248) the Yoga _S_ astra is referred to\neo nomine. What _S_ astra is here alluded to? Is it Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali's, or some\nother _S_ astra dealing with similar topics? Or, again, is it an entirely\ndifferent matter that is alluded to, and are we not to see in the expression\nin question an allusion to any system formally propounded? I own, as stated in\nthe note on the passage, that my mind inclines to the last view. There is not\nvery much to say on either side of the question, as far as I am able to\nunderstand it. But the view I incline to appears to have one small\ncircumstance in its favour. At [p. 249](sbe0831.htm#page_249) we have an\nallusion to persons who understand the Yoga, and to a certain illustration\npropounded by them. Now who are these persons? My limited knowledge of Yoga\nliterature has not enabled me to trace the illustration anywhere else than in\nthe Ka _th_ opanishad, and in the Sanatsu _g_ atiya. It seems to me very\nunlikely, that the illustration can have been put forward in any work older\nthan the Kathopanishad. And we may, I think, assume it as most probable that\nthe Sanatsu _g_ atiya borrowed it from that work. If so, it is not likely that\nthe Anugita can have referred to any other master of the Yoga than, the author\nof the Kathopanishad. And then it would seem to follow, that the Anugita must\nhave been composed at a time when, although the Upanishads were looked on with\nreverence and as works of authority, they were not yet regarded as part and\nparcel of the Vedic revelation 1. It is impossible not to perceive, that the\ntrain of reasoning here is at every stage hedged round with difficulties and\ndoubts. And the inference therefore to which we are led by it must be accepted\nwith proportionate\n\np. 212\n\ncaution. But if the reasoning is correct, it seems to be certain, that the\nAnugita belongs to some period prior to the second, and probable, that it\nbelongs to some period prior to the third century, before Christ. For in the\nsecond century before Christ was composed the Mahabhashya of Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali, in\nwhich Rahasyas--which is another name for Upanishads--are mentioned as forming\npart of the Vedic literature. And in \xc3\x82pastamba's Dharma-sutras, which are\nolder than Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali, Upanishads 1 are mentioned in the same way. I am\naware that it may be said, that because Upanishads as a class of works are\nmentioned by Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali and \xc3\x82pastamba, it does not follow that any\nparticular Upanishad, such as the Ka _th_ a, for instance, also existed at\nthat time. This is quite true. But without going now into the general\nquestion, it is sufficient to point out, that on. argument here is concerned\nmerely with the recognition of the Upanishads as a class of works forming part\nof the Vedic canon. Such recognition must have come later than the period at\nwhich the Anugita could speak of a passage in the Ka _th_ a-upanishad as the\nutterance of Yogavids, or persons who understood the Yoga.\n\nTurning now to the materials available for ascertaining the relative\nchronological positions of the Anugita and the rise of Buddhism, we have again\nto complain of their unsatisfactory character. We will briefly note the two or\nthree circumstances which appear to have a bearing upon this question. In the\nfirst place, we have the word Nirva _n_ a used in one passage of the Anugita\nin the sense of the highest tranquillity, and there the simile of the\nextinction of the fire Is expressly adduced. On this it may be argued, that if\nthe term Nirva _n_ a had become the well-understood property of Buddhism, such\na use of it as we find here would probably not have occurred. Again, we have\nthe injunction that an ascetic must dwell in a town only for one day and no\nmore, while he may, stay at one place during the rains. This is very similar\nto an injunction prescribed by the Buddhistic teachers also. But\n\np. 213\n\nthis fact furnishes, I think, no safe ground for a chronological inference,\nmore especially because, as pointed out by Dr. Buhler, the Buddhistic\ninjunction is itself only borrowed from the Brahmanical rules on the subject\n1. It is impossible, therefore, to say that the Anugita borrowed its doctrine\nfrom Buddhism. It is, of course, equally impossible on the other hand to say,\nthat Buddhism borrowed its rule from the Anugita. And, therefore, we can build\nno safe inference upon this fact either. We have next the very remarkable\npassage at chapter XXXIV, where various contradictory and mutually exclusive\nviews of piety are stated, or rather passingly and briefly indicated--a\npassage which one most devoutly wishes had been clearer than it is. In that\npassage I can find no reference to Buddhism. True it is that Nilaka _nth_ a's\ncommentary refers some of the doctrines there stated to Buddhistic schools 2.\nBut that commentary, unsatisfactory enough in other places, is particularly\nunsatisfactory here. And its critical accuracy may be judged from its\nreference to Saugatas and Yoga _k_ aras apparently as two distinct schools,\nwhereas in truth the Saugatas are Buddhists, and Yoga _k_ aras one of the four\nprincipal Buddhist sects. And it must be further remembered, that the\ninterpretations of Nilaka _nth_ a, upon which his specifications of the\ndifferent schools are based, are by no means such as necessarily claim\nacceptance. If then we d o not find any reference to Buddhism in this passage,\nthat fact becomes certainly a remarkable one. Still, on the other hand, I am\nnot prepared to apply the 'negative argument' here, and to say that inasmuch\nas Buddhism is not referred to where so many different opinions are referred\nto, Buddhism cannot have come into existence at the date of the Anugita. It\nseems to me that the argument will here be a very hazardous one, because if\nthe author of the Anugita was, as we may assume he was, an orthodox Hindu, he\nmight well have declined, although not unacquainted with Buddhism, to put into\nthe mouths of the-seven sages even as a possible view, that\n\np. 214\n\nwhich was the view of a school esteemed heretical by the author and his co-\nreligionists. This passage, therefore, also fails to furnish any tangible\nground for a chronological inference, at all events in the present state of\nour knowledge. Lastly, we come to the allusion to those who indulge in\nconstant talk in disparagement of Vedas and Brahma _n_ as, the two being thus\nbracketed together in the original. That seems, at the first blush, to be a\nsomewhat more distinct allusion to Buddhism than any of those we have noted\nabove. But even that is not unambiguous. If the stanzas quoted by Madhava _k_\narya, in his Sarvadar _s_ anasa _n_ graha in its first section, are the\ncomposition of the original founder of the _K_ arvaka school, or even if they\ncorrectly represent the earliest opinions of that school, it is at least quite\nas likely that the _K_ arvakas were the target for the denunciations of the\nAnugita in the passage in question as that the Buddhists were so. To me,\nindeed, it appears to be more likely. For Buddha's opinion with regard to the\nVedas is, that they are inadequate; with regard to the Brahma _n_ as, that\nthey are in no sense the chosen of God as they claim to be. The opinion of the\n_K_ arvakas, on the other hand, is a far, more aggressive one, so to say.\nAccording to Madhava _k_ arya, they taught that the Vedas were either simple\nfatuity or imposture, and that the Brahma _n_ as were impostors. It seems to\nme much more likely, that this, which I have called a comparatively aggressive\nattitude, was the one at which the remarks of the Anugita were levelled; and\nmore especially does this appear to be correct when we remember, that the view\ntaught by Gautama Buddha regarding the Vedas and the Brahma _n_ as was\npropounded by him only in its strongest form; and that even before his time,\nthe doctrine of the inadequacy of the Vedas for the purpose of securing the\nsummum bonum of humanity had been taught by other teachers. It is further to\nbe recollected, that we have evidence showing that other thinkers also than\nBuddha, or B _ri_ haspati, had in early days attacked the authority of the\nVedas. Kautsa is the name of one who was probably the most distinguished among\nthem. It is certainly possible that his followers\n\np. 215\n\nwere the people branded as of 'the dark quality' by the Anugita in the passage\nin question. We have, therefore, at least two different recognised bodies of\nthinkers, and one individual thinker, to whom the words under discussion may\napply, and it is plainly unsafe, under these circumstances, to draw any\nchronological inference based on the hypothesis of one particular body out of\nthose three being the one intended by the author. Before closing this part of\nthe investigation, it may be interesting to note, that the phrase 'turning the\nwheel,' a phrase now so familiar to us as one of the household words of\nBuddhism, is used in the Anugita with respect to King _G_ anaka. I do not\nthink, however, that either alone, or even coupled with the word Nirvana, that\nphrase can be made the basis of any legitimate deduction in favour of the\npriority of the Anugita, to Buddhism. At the outside, the only deduction\nadmissible, if any deduction were admissible, would be, that the Anugita was\ncomposed prior to the recognition, of Nirva _n_ a and _K_ akrapravartana as\nspecially Buddhistic words. But priority to such recognition is not, I\napprehend, necessarily synonymous with priority to the rise of Buddhism.\n\nThe net result of this part of the investigation appears to be, that we have\npretty strong grounds for holding the Anugita to belong to a period very\nconsiderably removed from the period of the Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita;\nbut that we have no tangible grounds on which to base any deduction regarding\nits priority or otherwise to the Sa _n_ khya, and Yoga systems of philosophy,\nor to the great movement of Gautama Buddha. There is only one other point,\nwhich we can establish in a not entirely unsatisfactory way, and which enables\nus to draw closer the limits within which the Anugita must have been composed.\nThat point is the position of the Anugita with reference to \xc3\x82pastamba's\nDharma-sutra. I need not say again, that I accept here the proposition about\nthe age of \xc3\x82pastamba which has been laid down by Dr. Buhler, as a sufficiently\nsatisfactory working hypothesis. And accepting that proposition, I venture to\nsuggest the fourth century B.C. as a not unlikely date for the Anugita. It\nappears to me, that a comparison of\n\np. 216\n\nthe Anugita and the rules of \xc3\x82pastamba upon one important point which they\nboth deal with shows the priority of the former work. I allude to the rules\nand regulations touching the four \xc3\x82 _s_ ramas or orders contained in the\nAnugita and in the Dharma-sutra of \xc3\x82pastamba. One circumstance strikes us at\nonce on I comparing the two works on this point. \xc3\x82pastamba goes into a very\ngreat deal of minute details more than the Anugita, although the latter work\ndoes not deal with the topic in any very summary mode. Taking all the\ndifferences between the two works together, and the fact that the Anugita sets\nabout the discussion of the topic in a manner which seems intended to be--not,\nindeed, absolutely exhaustive, but still--very full, I am very strongly\ninclined to attribute the differences. to an actual development and progress\nof doctrine. I will endeavour to illustrate this view by means of a few\ndetailed instances 1. And let us first take the order of householders to which\nthe Anugita gives precedence over the others. One of the injunctions laid down\nby the Anugita is that the householder should always be devoted to his wife.\nAgainst this simple precept, we have a very minute series of rules prescribed\nby \xc3\x82pastamba, which it is not necessary to refer to specifically, but which\nmay be seen in several of the Sutras contained in the first Kha _nd_ a of the\nfirst Pa _t_ ala of the Second Pra _s_ na. Compare again the excessive\nminuteness of the rules regarding the Bali-offering or the reception of\nguests, as given by \xc3\x82pastamba, with the simple statement of the Anugita that\nthe five great sacrifices should be performed. There again, I think, we are to\nsee in this difference of treatment the result of a pretty long course of\nceremonial progress. Proceeding to the rules regarding the Brahma _k_ arin or\nstudent, an analogous phenomenon meets us there. Taking first the subject of\nfood, we have a considerable number of detailed injunctions in \xc3\x82pastamba,\ncompared with the simple rule of the Anugita, that the student should, with\nthe leave of his preceptor, eat his food without decrying it. Again with\nregard to alms, whereas the Anugita simply\n\np. 217\n\nsays that the student should take his food out of the alms received by him,\n\xc3\x82pastamba has an elaborate catena of rules as to how the alms are to be\ncollected, and from whom, and so forth. Take again the provisions in the two\nworks regarding the description of the cloth, staff, and girdle of the\nstudent. \xc3\x82pastamba refers to various opinions on this subject, of which there\nis not even a trace in the Anugita 1. It appears that even before \xc3\x82pastamba's\ntime, distinctions had been laid down as to the description of girdle staff\nand cloth to be used by the different castes--distinctions of which there is\nno hint in the Anugita, where all students, of whatever caste, are spoken of\nunder the generic name. These distinctions appear to me to point very strongly\nto that ceremonial and doctrinal progress of which we have spoken above. The\ntendency is visible in them to sever the Brahma _n_ as from the other castes--\nby external marks. And that tendency, it seems to me, must have set in, as the\nmerits which had given the Brahma _n_ a caste its original position at the\nhead of Hindu society were ceasing to be a living reality, and that caste was\nintrenching itself, so to say, more behind the worth and work of the early\nfounders of its greatness, than the worth and work of their degenerating\nrepresentatives. These comparisons, taken together, appear to me to warrant\nthe proposition we have already laid down with regard to the priority of the\nAnugita to \xc3\x82pastamba. If we have not referred to the rules relating to the two\nother orders of forester and ascetic, it is because the scope for a comparison\nof those is very limited. Those rules alone would scarcely authorise the\ninference drawn above; but I can perceive nothing in them to countervail the\neffect of the comparisons already made. And it must be remembered, that the\nrules as to foresters and ascetics would be less apt to undergo change than\nchose as to students and householders.\n\nIt appears to me that the view we have now expressed may be also supported by\na comparison of the doctrines of the Anugita and \xc3\x82pastamba touching the duties\nof Brahma _n_ as. According to \xc3\x82pastamba, the occupations lawful\n\np. 218\n\nto Brahma _n_ as are the famous six referred to in our Introduction to the\nBhagavadgita, and two others superadded, namely, inheritance and gleaning corn\nin the fields. These last are not mentioned in the Anugita, or in Manu either,\nand are, even according to \xc3\x82pastamba, common to Brahma _n_ as with Kshatriyas\nand Vai _s_ yas. But as regards the six above referred to, it is worthy of\nnote, that the Anugita apparently groups them into two distinct sets of three.\nThe first set of three consists of those which, in our Introduction to the\nBhagavadgita, we have characterised as constituting rather the rights than the\nduties of Brahma _n_ as, and which the Anugita describes as 'means of\nlivelihood for Brahmanas.' The other set of three consists of real duties, and\nthese the Anugita speaks of as 'pious duties.' This grouping appears to me to\nfurnish powerful corroboration of the view put forward in our introduction to\nthe Bhagavadgita. It would seem, that the possession of the moral and\nspiritual merits which, according to the Gita, constituted the duty of Brahma\n_n_ as, in the simple and archaic society there disclosed, was developed, in a\nmore advanced and artificial state of society, into the performance of the\n'pious duties' of the Anugita and the duties which are 'the means of\nlivelihood.' Then in the further social evolution, in the course of which the\nold spiritual view began to be forgotten, and the actual facts of the past\nbegan to be transmuted into the dogmatic rules of the future, the occupations\nof receiving presents, imparting instruction, and officiating at sacrifices,\nbecame the special occupations of the Brahma _n_ as, and the distinction\nbetween these occupations from their higher duties was thrown into the\nbackground; and accordingly we find no allusion to any such distinction in\n\xc3\x82pastamba or Manu, or, as far as I know, in any other later embodiment of the\ncurrent ideas on the subject 1. If all this has been correctly argued, the\nconclusion derivable from it is in entire accord with that which we have\nalready drawn, namely, that the Bhagavadgita, the Anugita, and the Dharma-\nsutra of \xc3\x82pastamba, belong to different\n\np. 219\n\nstages of ancient Indian history, and that the stage to which the Gita belongs\nis the earliest, and that to which \xc3\x82pastamba belongs, the latest of such\nstages.\n\nI am unable to find anything else in the way of internal evidence bearing upon\nthe date of the Anugita. It appears to me, that the date to which the\ninvestigation we have now gone through leads us, is one which, in the present\nstate of our information, may be fairly accepted as a provisional hypothesis.\nIt does not appear to me to conflict with any ascertained dates, while it is\npointed to as probable by the various lines of testimony which we have here\nconsidered. We now proceed to discuss one or two other points which may have a\nbearing upon this topic, but which at present cannot yield us any positive\nguidance in our search for the date of the Anugita. And first among these, let\nus consider the various names of deities that occur in different parts of the\nwork. We have, then, Vish _n_ u, _S_ ambhu, Gish _n_ u, Soma, \xc3\x82ditya, Surya,\nMitra, Agni, _K_ andra, Rudra, _S_ iva, Varu _n_ a, Pra _g_ apati, Maghavat,\nPurandara, Indra, Brahman, _S_ atakratu, Dharma, Naraya _n_ a, Vayu, Yama,\nTvash _tr_ i, Hari, \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, and lastly Uma under three different names,\nnamely, Uma, Mahe _s_ vari, and Parvati. Now, leaving aside for the moment the\nthree names of Uma, which appear from the passage where they are used to be\nall three the names of the same goddess, there is no doubt that in the list\nabove set out, some of the names are merely used in different passages, but\nstill to indicate the same being. Thus, Indra, Satakratu, Purandara, and\nMaghavat are really the names of one and the same deity. But when Soma is\nmentioned as the deity presiding over the tongue, and _K_ andramas as the\ndeity presiding over the mind, it becomes doubtful whether the two names do\nreally indicate the same deity, albeit in later Sanskrit Soma and _K_ andramas\nboth signify the moon. Similarly, when Arka is said to be the deity presiding\nover the eye, and Mitra over another organ, it seems open to question whether\nArka and Mitra both signify the sun there, as they undoubtedly do in classical\nSanskrit. True it is, that even in such a recent work as the Sa _n_ khya-sara,\nthis mention\n\np. 220\n\nof Arka and Mitra as presiding deities of two several organs does occur. But\nit is plain, that that circumstance can have, no bearing on the inquiry before\nits, for the Sa _n_ khya-sara is avowedly a compilation based on older\nauthorities, and in the particular part under consideration, really reproduces\na passage from some older work. It cannot, therefore, be argued, that because\nArka and Mitra were identified with one another at the time of the Sa _n_\nkhya-sara, and yet are mentioned as deities of two separate organs, therefore,\nthey must have also been regarded as one in the older original work where they\nare also mentioned as deities of two separate organs. And it may, perhaps, be\nremarked here in passing, that the Vedanta Paribhasha has M _ri_ tyu instead\nof Mitra, which would get rid of the difficulty here altogether; while as\nregards Soma and _K_ andramas, the passage in the Sa _n_ khya-sara reads Pra\n_k_ etas instead of Soma, which would get rid of the other difficulty above\npointed out. Whether these discrepancies are owing to any tampering with the\nlists of organs and deities, at a time when the later identifications between\ndifferent deities took place, or whether they are to be explained on some\nother theory, it is impossible at present to say. And, therefore, it is also\nunnecessary to pursue the inquiry here any further. It must suffice for the\npresent to have drawn attention to the matter.\n\nAkin to this point, though quite distinct from it, is one which arises on a\npassage where the emancipated being is identified with Vish _n_ u, Mitra,\nAgni, Varuna, and Pra _g_ apati 1. Now it is reasonable to suppose, that the\ndeities thus specified here must have been among those held in highest repute\nat the time, the whole significance of the passage where they are mentioned\nrequiring that that should be so. But in our Pantheon as disclosed by our\nlater literature, Mitra and Agni and Varuna occupy but a very subordinate\nposition. Even in Kalidasa 2, the subordination of these deities to our\ncelebrated Trinity seems to be quite\n\np. 221\n\nfully established. But, on the other hand, in the Vedic theogony they are\namong the most prominent deities. In the Taittiriya-upanishad, we have in the\nvery first sentence Mitra, Varu _n_ a, Vish _n_ u, and Brahman (who may be\nidentified with Pra _g_ apati) all mentioned together, and their blessings\ninvoked. This does not help in fixing a date for the Anugita; but it lends\nsome support to the conclusion already arrived at on that point, by showing\nthat the theogony of the Anugita is not yet very far removed from the theogony\nof the Vedic times, while it is separated by a considerable interval from the\ntheogony disclosed in the works of even such an early writer of the classical\nperiod' as Kalidasa.\n\nAnother point of similar bearing on our present investigation is the mode in\nwhich the story of Para _s_ urama is dealt with in the Anugita. There is in\nthe first place no allusion to his being an incarnation of Vish _n_ u, nor to\nthe encounter between him and his namesake, the son of Da _s_ aratha and the\nhero of the Ramaya _n_ a. We have, on the contrary, an explicit statement,\nthat after the advice of the 'Pit _ri_ s' he entirely abandons the slaughter\nof the Kshatriyas, and resorting to penance thereby achieves final\nemancipation. We have elsewhere argued 1, that the theory of Para _s_ urama\nbeing an incarnation of Vish _n_ u, must have probably originated prior to the\ntime of Bhart _ri_ hari, but later than the time of Kalidasa. The allusion to\nParasurama in the work before us does not, however, enable us to judge of its\nchronological position with reference to Kalidasa. But the last point\ndiscussed renders it unnecessary to consider this question further. It may be\nnoted, by the way, that the Anugita represents Para _s_ urama, although living\nin the \xc3\x82 _s_ rama or hermitage of his father, who was a _Ri_ shi, as mounting\na chariot for the purpose of sweeping away the kinsmen of Kartavirya. Whence\nhe obtained a chariot in a hermitage, the Anugita does not explain.\n\nIn connexion with the episode of Parasurama, may be noted the list which\noccurs in the course of it, of the\n\np. 222\n\ndegraded Kshatriya tribes, of Dravi _d_ as, Sabaras, &c. I am unable to see\nthat those names can give us any further help in our present investigation\nthan in so far as they show that, at the time of the Anugita, there must have\nbeen some information about the south of India available in the districts\nwhere the author of the Anugita lived. Some of the tribes mentioned appear to\nhave been located far in the south of the Indian peninsula. But this is a\npoint on which we shall have to say something more in discussing, the next\nitem of internal evidence to which we shall refer. Here it is enough to point\nout that some of the tribes mentioned in the Anugita are also referred to in\nno less a work than the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a 1.\n\nWe come next to the enumeration of the principal mountains which is contained\nin one passage of the Anugita. Those mountains are the Himalaya, the\nPariyatra, the Sahya, the Vindhya, the. Triku _t_ avat, the _S_ veta, the\nNila, the Bhasa, the Kosh _th_ avat, the Mahendra, the Malyavat, and perhaps\nthe Guruskandha. I am not sure whether the last name is intended to be taken\nas a proper name, or only as an epithet of Mahendra. Now compared with the\nmountains mentioned in the Bhagavadgita, this is certainly a remarkable list.\nThe Gita mentions only Meru 2 and Himalaya; while here we have in the Anugita\nthe Sahya,. and Malaya, and Triku _t_ avat, and Nila (the same, I presume,\nwith the modem Nilgiri, the Sanatarium of the Madras Presidency), which take\nus far to the west and south of the Indian peninsula; and the Mahendra and\nMalyavat, which, coupled with the mention of the river Ganges, cover a\nconsiderable part of the eastern districts. The Pariyatra and Vindhya occupy\nthe regions of Central India. The Anugita, therefore, seems to belong to that\nperiod in the history of India, when pretty nearly the whole,\n\np. 223\n\nif not absolutely the whole, of the Indian continent was known to the\nSanskrit-speaking population of the country. When was this knowledge reached?\nIt is difficult to fix the precise period; and even if it could be fixed, it\nwould not help us to fix satisfactorily any point of time to which the Anugita\ncould be attributed. But it may be pointed out here, that in Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali's\nMahabhashya we have evidence of such knowledge having been possessed by the\n\xc3\x82ryas in the second century B.C. In truth, the evidence available in the\nMahabhashya is even fuller than this in the Anugita. For Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali tells\nus of a town or city in the south named Ka\xc3\xb1 _ki_ pura 1; he speaks of the\ndominions of the Pa _nd_ ya kings, and of the Kola and Kerala districts 2; he\nrefers also to the large tanks of the south; and he makes allusions to\nlinguistic usages current in the southern and other provinces 3. Before Pata\xc3\xb1\n_g_ ali's time there had taken place Mahendra's invasion of Ceylon, and the\ninvading army must have penetrated through the southern provinces. And there\nhad been also put up the great Inscriptions of Asoka, which have attracted so\nmuch interest, and are proving such prolific sources of information in various\ndepartments of knowledge. One of these inscriptions was at Ga\xc3\xb1 _g_ am, which\nis not very far from the Mahendra mountain alluded to in the Anugita 4. All\nthese facts support the conclusion drawn by General Cunningham from the\ncorrectness of the information given to Alexander the Great by the Hindus of\nhis time, namely, that 'the Indians, even at that early date in their history,\nhad a very accurate knowledge of the form and extent of their native land 5.'\nAnd not only do they support that conclusion, they show that the knowledge\ncovered other facts regarding\n\np. 224\n\ntheir native land than its form and extent. It follows consequently that this\nenumeration of mountains does not require the date of the Anugita to be\nbrought down to a later period than the fourth century B.C., and leaves it\nopen to us, therefore, to accept whatever conclusion the other evidence\navailable may seem to justify. On the other hand, it is plain also, that it\naffords no positive information as to when the Anugita was composed, and\ntherefore we need not dwell any further upon the point on the present\noccasion.\n\nThere are a few other points which arise upon the contents of the Anugita, but\nwhich are not, in the present condition of our knowledge, capable of affording\nany certain guidance in our present investigation. Thus we have the story of\nDharma appearing before king _G_ anaka disguised as a Brahma _n_ a. I am not\naware of any case of such disguises occurring in any of the Upanishads,\nalthough there are numerous parallel instances throughout the Puranik\nliterature 1. It is, however, difficult to draw any definite chronological\ninference from this fact. There is further the reference to the attack of Rahu\non the sun. It is difficult, in the present state of our knowledge, to say for\ncertain, when the theory of eclipses there implied was prevalent. In the _Kh_\nandogya-upanishad 2 we have the emancipated self compared to the moon escaped\nfrom the mouth of Rahu. And a text of the Rig-veda, quoted by Mr. Ya _g_\n\xc3\xb1esvara _S_ astrin in his \xc3\x82ryavidyasudhakara 3, speaks of the demon Rahu\nattacking the sun with darkness. Here again we have another matter of some\ninterest; but I cannot see that any safe deduction can be derived from it,\nwithout a more ample knowledge of other relevant matters than is at present\naccessible. Take again the references to certain practices which look very\nmuch like the practices of the _G_ ainas of the present day. Is the Anugita,\nthen, earlier or later than the rise of the _G_ aina system? It is not safe, I\nthink, to found an answer to this question upon the very narrow basis afforded\nby the\n\np. 225\n\npassage referred to. But it may be observed, that the precepts laid down in\nthe passage in question are laid down as precepts for orthodox Hindus, and not\nas the doctrines of a heretical sect. They are also very general, and not so\nminute as those which the _G_ ainas of the present day observe as binding upon\nthem. If, therefore, any conclusion is to be drawn from these precepts, it\nmust be that the Anugita must have been composed prior to the rise of _G_\nainism; and that _G_ ainism must have appropriated and developed this doctrine\nwhich it obtained from the current Brahmanism 1. If this is so, the Anugita\nmust be a very ancient work indeed. It is not, however, necessary to further\nwork out this line of argument, having regard to the opinions recently\nexpressed by Mr. Thomas 2, rehabilitating the views enunciated long ago by\nColebrooke and others. If those views are correct, and if _G_ ainism was a\ndominant system in this country prior even to the time of Gautama Buddha, and\nif, further, we are right in the suggestion--for it is no more it must be\nremembered--that the Anugita dates from a period prior to the rise of _G_\nainism, then it would seem to follow that the Anugita belongs to some period\nprior to the sixth century B.C. All this, however, is at present very\nhypothetical, and we draw attention to it only that the question may be\nhereafter considered when fuller materials for adjudicating upon it become\naccessible. Meanwhile, having regard to the views above alluded to as so\nelaborately put forward by Mr. Thomas, it is possible for us still to hold\nthat, in the present state of our knowledge, the third or fourth century B.C.\nis not too early a date to, assign to the Anugita, even on the assumption that\nthe precepts contained in that work regarding the care to be taken of worms\nand insects were borrowed by it from the _G_ aina system. With this negative\nresult, we must for the present rest contented.\n\nOne other fact of similar nature to those we have now\n\np. 226\n\ndealt with may, perhaps, be also noticed here. We allude to the stanzas which\nwe find in the Anugita and also in the Santi Parvan of the Mahabharata and in\nthe Manusm _ri_ ti. There is also one which the Anugita has in common with the\nPari _s_ ish _t_ a of Yaska's Nirukta 1. It is not possible, I conceive, to\nsay finally whether one of these works borrowed these stanzas from the other\nof them; while, on the other hand, it is quite possible, as already argued by\nus in the Introduction to the Gita, that all these works were only reproducing\nfrom some entirely different work, or that the stanzas in question were the\ncommon property of the thinkers of the time. We have no means available for\ndeciding between these conflicting hypotheses.\n\nWe have thus noticed all the salient points in the evidence, external and\ninternal, which is available for determining the position of the Anugita in\nour ancient literature. Nobody who has seen even a little of the history of\nthat literature will be surprised at the quantity or quality of that evidence,\nor the nature of the conclusions legitimately yielded by it. We have\nendeavoured to express those conclusions in language which should not indicate\nany greater certainty as attaching to them than can fairly be claimed for\nthem. The net result appears to be this. The Anugita may be taken with\nhistorical certainty to have been some centuries old in the time of the great\nSankara _k_ arya. It was very probably older than the Dharma-sutras of\n\xc3\x82pastamba, but by what period of time we are not in a position at present to\ndefine. It was, perhaps, older also than the rise of Buddhism and Gainism, and\nof the Yoga philosophy; but on this it is impossible to say anything with any\napproach to confidence. It is, on the other hand, almost certain that it\nbelongs to a period very considerably removed from the older Upanishads.;\nprobably removed by a distance of some centuries, during which 'stories' not\ncontained in the Upanishads had not only obtained currency, but also come to\nbe regarded as belonging to antiquity 2. And yet the period to\n\np. 227\n\nwhich the work belongs was one in which the Upanishads were only reverenced as\nthe authoritative opinions of eminent men, not as the words of God himself 1.\nIn this respect, it may be said that the Anugita seems rather to belong to an\nearlier stratum of thought than even the Sanatsu _g_ atiya, in which a _G_\n\xc3\xb1anaka _nd_ a, as forming a part of the Vedic canon, seems to be recognised 2.\nBut it is abundantly clear, that the Anugita stands, at a very considerable\nchronological distance from the Bhagavadgita.\n\nSuch are the results of our investigation. We have not thought it necessary to\ndiscuss the verse or the language of the work. But it must in fairness be\npointed out, that upon the whole, the verse and language are both pretty near\nthe classical model. There are, it is true, a few instances of the metrical\nanomalies we have noticed elsewhere, but having regard to the extent of the\nwork, those instances are far from being very numerous. The language and\nstyle, too, are not quite smooth and polished; though, judging from them\nalone, I should rather be inclined to place the Sanatsu _g_ atiya prior to the\nAnugita. But that suggests a question which we cannot now stop to discuss.\n\nOne word, in conclusion, about the translation. The text used has been chiefly\nthat adopted in the commentary of Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, a commentary which on\nthe whole I prefer very much to that of Nilaka _nth_ a, which has been printed\nin the Bombay edition of the Mahabharata. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, as a rule,\naffords some explanation where explanation is wanted, and does not endeavour\nto suit his text to any foregone conclusion. His comments have been of the\ngreatest possible help to me; and my only regret is that the only copy of his\ncommentary which was available to me, and the use of which I owe to the\nkindness of my friend Professor Bha _nd_ arkar, was not as correct a one as\ncould be desired. I have also looked into the Vishama _s_ loki, a short work\ncontaining notes on difficult passages of the Mahabharata.\n\np. 228\n\n[paragraph continues] The MS. of it belonging to the Government Collection of\nMSS. deposited in Deccan College was lent me also by Professor Bha _nd_ arkar.\nThe principles adopted in the translation and notes have been the same as\nthose followed in the other pieces contained in this volume.\n\nP. S. I take this opportunity of stating that it is not at all certain that Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra is the name of the author of the commentary which I have\nused. I find that in supposing Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra to be the author, I\nconfounded that commentary, which does not mention its author's name, with the\ncommentary on another section of the Mahabharata which does give its author's\nname as Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, and which is also among the MSS. purchased by\nProfessor Bha _nd_ arkar for the Government of Bombay. (See with regard to\nthese MSS. Professor Bha _nd_ arkar's recently published Report on the search\nfor Sanskrit MSS. Of 7th July, 1880.)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[201:1](sbe0827.htm#fr_983) In the beginning of his gloss on the Anugita he\nsays, that it proposes to explain difficult passages in the Anugita, &c.--\nAnugatadishu.
