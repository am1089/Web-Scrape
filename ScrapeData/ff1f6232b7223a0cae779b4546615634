Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! Mahar _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha was the mind-\nborn son of Brahma; how is it then that you have named him as Maitra-Varu _n_\ni. Is it that he got this name by some action or by some Gu _n_ as? Kindly\ntell me the origin of this name, O Best of speakers!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n3-4. Vyasa said :-- O King! It is quite true that the illustrious Vas\xc2\x92i _st_\nha was the noble son of Brahma but he had to quit that body due to the curse\nof the King Nimi and he had to take a second body from Mitra Varu _n_ a; hence\nhe is named in this world as Maitra-Varu _n_ i.\n\n\n\n5-6. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! How was it that the religious Vas\xc2\x92i _st_\nha, the best of the Munis, the son of Brahma was cursed by the King? Oh! The\nMunis have to suffer the dreadful curse of K _s_ attriya kings! This seems\nvery wonderful to me. O Knower of Dharma! Why did that king curse the innocent\nMuni? I am very curious to hear the cause of this; kindly tell me the cause of\nthe curse.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7-30. Vyasa said :-- O King! I told you already in particular all the causes\nof these. This Samsara is pervaded by the three Gu _n_ as of Maya, Sattva,\nRaja and Tama. Whether the kings practise their Dharma or the ascetics\npractise their tapas, all their actions are interpenetrated with these Gu _n_\nas; therefore they cannot shine so brightly. The Kings, Munis performed very\nsevere penances and austerities under the influence of lust, anger, greed and\nAhamkara. O King! All, whether they be the K _s_ attriyas or the Brahma _n_\nas, who perform their sacrifices overpowered with this Rajo Gu _n_ a, really,\nnone of them performs these actions guided by Sattva Gu _n_ a. The King Nimi\nwas cursed by the Ri _s_ i and the Ri _s_ i was cursed again by the King Nimi;\nthus they met with greater calamities and painful sufferings, the fruits from\nthe hands of the powerful Fate. O King! In this world of the three Gu _n_ as,\nit is very difficult for the beings to get the Dravya S\xc2\x92uddhi, Kriya S\xc2\x92uddhi,\nand the pure effulgent Chitta S\xc2\x92uddhi, O King! Know this as the influence\nwielded\n\n\n\np. 531\n\n\n\nby the Highest S\xc2\x92akti, the Mother of this Universe. Nobody is able to overstep\nit; but he, whom She favours, can cross in a moment this world, bounded by the\nthree Gu _n_ as. What more can be said than the fact that Hari, Hara, and\nBrahma and the other Gods cannot free themselves without Her grace. Moreover,\nthe sinners like Satyavrata and others become free when Her Grace comes upon\nthem. Nobody in these three worlds can know what reigns in Her mind; again,\nthis is also a certain fact that She gets Herself bound by Her own will to Her\ndevotees. Therefore it is extremely desirable that one should have recourse to\nSattviki devotion for the complete removal of faults and sins. And as the\ndevotion with attachment and vanity is always injurious to men, therefore it\nis highly beneficial to quit it; there is no doubt in this. O King! There was\na king named Nimi, born of the family of Ik _s_ aku. He was beautiful, well\nqualified, virtuous, truthful, charitable, endearing to his people, a\nsacrificer, of pure conduct and manners, ready to govern his subjects,\nintelligent and endowed with knowledge. For the benefit of the Brahma _n_ as,\nthat high-souled king established a city named Jayantupur in close vicinity to\nthe hermitage of Gautama. Thus some time passed when this Rajasik idea arose\nin his mind that \xc2\x93I will perform a sacrifice extending for a good many years\nwhen I will give exhorbitant Dak _s_ i _n_ as (remunerations to the priests\nand Brahmi _n_ s).\xc2\x94 Getting permission from his own father Ik _s_ aku, he\nbegan to collect all the ingredients necessary for the sacrifice, as advised\nby the high-souled persons. He invited the all-knowing Munis and ascetics,\nversed in the Vedas and in conducting sacrifices, e.g., Bhrigu, Angira,\nVamadeva, Gautama, Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, Pulastya, Richika, Pulaha, Kratu and others,\nall well-versed in the Vedas. Then that religious King Nimi, collecting all\nthe materials necessary for sacrifice worshipped his own Guru Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha\nand then spoke to him (the Guru) with great humility. O Best of Munis! I will\nperform a sacrifice; kindly perform this my sacrificial act; you are my Guru\nand therefore you know everything; so do this sacrifice for me. All the\narticles for this purpose are brought and cleansed. O Guru! Know that for five\nthousand years I mean to be engaged in this sacrifice, this is my Sankalpa\n(will). I will worship the Goddess Ambika in this sacrifice and for Her\nsatisfaction I am arranging for it according to the prescribed rules. Hearing\nthe King Nimi\xc2\x92s words, Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha said :-- \xc2\x93O best of Kings! Indra, the\nKing of the Devas, has already selected me for his sacrificial ceremony. Now\nIndra is ready to do the sacrifice for the propitiation of the Highest S\xc2\x92akti\nand I have initiated him for five hundred years. Therefore, O King! You will\nhave to wait till I complete the Indra\xc2\x92s Yaj\xc3\xb1a. After fully completing all his\nworks, I will come here. Therefore, O King! Wait till then.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 532\n\n\n\n31-42. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Best of Munis! I have already invited other Munis\nfor this sacrifice and have collected all the materials; how, then, can I wait\nfor you? O Brahma _n_ a! You are the foremost of those versed in the Vedas and\nyou are the family Guru of the noble Ik _s_ aku. How is it, then, avoiding my\nwork you are ready to go elsewhere O Best of Brahmi _n_ s! Under the\nuncontrollable greed of wealth you have lost all senses and you are ready to\ngo away without doing my work. This does not behove you.\xc2\x94 O King! Though thus\ntempted by the King Nimi, the Ri _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha went to the Indra\xc2\x92s\nsacrifice. The King, too, became absent-minded and selected for the sacrifice\nthe Ri _s_ i Gautama. He then commenced his sacrificial ceremony close to the\nocean by the side of the Himalayan range and gave profusely the Dak _s_ i _n_\nas. The King Nimi was engaged in this sacrificial act for five thousand years.\nIn this the Rittviks (priests) were worshipped with sufficient wealth and\ncows; they were extremely glad. Then, when the five hundred years extending\nsacrifice of Indra was completed, the Ri _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha came to see the\nKing Nimi\xc2\x92s sacrifice and waited there to see the King. The king was then\nasleep; so the servants did not awake him from his sleep; and the King did not\ncome to the Ri _s_ i. Feeling insult at this, the Mahar _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha\nbecame infuriated with rage. Not seeing the King, he became very angry; and,\nsubject to this, he cursed the King, When I am your lifelong Guru, especially\nwhen I prohibited you and you have forsaken me and selected another Guru and\nby your sheer force you are initiated, then be devoid of your body. Let your\nbody fall off today.\n\n\n\n43-50. Vyasa said :-- The King\xc2\x92s attendants, hearing thus the curse given by\nVas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha to the King, instantly awoke him from his sleep and informed him\nthat the Ri _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha not seeing you, became very angry. The King\nNimi, quite sinless, went then to the angry Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha and humbly spoke to\nhim the following reasonable words, pregnant with meaning. O Knower of Dharma!\nI am your Yajamana; though I repeatedly requested you to perform my sacrifice,\nyet you quitted me out of the covetousness and went somewhere else. I cannot\nbe charged with any fault. You are the foremost of Brahmi _n_ s; and knowing\nthat contentment is the substance of your Dharma, you did not feel ashamed to\ndo this blameable act. You are the son of Brahma; and, being versed in the\nVedas and Vedangas, you are yet unaware of the subtle and very difficult\nnature of the Brahmi _n_ ic religion. Now you want to cast your own fault on\nmy shoulders and you are trying in vain to curse me. Anger is more to be\nblamed than Cha _nd_ ala! The wise men should overcome it by all means. When\nyou, infuriated with rage, have been able to curse me for nothing, then I now\ncurse you, \xc2\x93Let your this body, inflamed with\n\n\n\np. 533\n\n\n\nanger, drop off.\xc2\x94 O King! Thus the King cursed the Muni and the Muni cursed\nthe King; and both of them were, therefore, very sorry.\n\n\n\n51-52. Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha then became troubled with cares and took shelter with\nBrahma and informing him about the great curse given by the King Nimi said :--\nFather! The King has cursed me saying, \xc2\x93Let your body fall off today. Now the\ngreat trouble due to the falling off of the body has arisen. What am to do\nnow?\n\n\n\n53-69. O Father! Kindly tell me from whom shall I take my birth and take such\nmeans as I can get a body like what I have now. Also by Your unbounded power,\ndo so that I can retain the knowledge in that body as I have at present; You\nare fully competent to do this.\xc2\x94 O King! Hearing thus the words of Vas\xc2\x92i _st_\nha, Brahma spoke thus to his dear son :-- Go and enter into the Tejas\n(essence) of Mitra Varu _n_ a and remain contented; then you will get, in due\ntime, a body not born of any womb and you will be again religious, truthful,\nknower of the Vedas, all-knowing and worshipped by all; there is no doubt in\nthis. When Brahma said this, the Mahar _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha bowed down to the\nGrand Sire, and circumambulating him, went to the abode of Varu _n_ a. Then he\nquitted his excellent body; and, with his subtle body, the part of his Jiva,\nentered into the body of Mitra Varu _n_ a. Then once on a time Urvas\xc2\x92i,\nexquisitely beautiful and lovely, surrounded by her comrades, went wilfully\ninto the abode of Varu _n_ a. Mitra-Varu _n_ a, the two Devas became very\npassionate to see that Apsara (the celestial nymph) endowed with youth and\nbeauty and being enchanted with the arrows of cupid, and, being senseless,\naddressed to the Deva Kanya Urvas\xc2\x92i, beautiful in all her parts, thus :-- \xc2\x93O\nLovely One! Seeing you, we are very much troubled with the arrows of cupid; O\nBeautiful One! Select us and remain and enjoy here at your pleasure.\xc2\x94 When\nthey said thus, Urvas\xc2\x92i became attached to them; and, under their control,\nbegan to stay in the house of Mitra Varu _n_ a. When Urvas\xc2\x92i began to remain\nthere, strongly attached to them, the semen of Mitra Varu _n_ a dropped in an\nuncovered jar. And the two beautiful sons of the Ri _s_ is were born out of\nthat; Agasti was the first child and Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha the second. Thus, out of\nthe semen of Mitra Varu _n_ a, the two ascetics were born. The first Agasti\nturned out a great ascetic in his childhood and resorted to forest; Ik _s_ aku\nthe best of Kings, selected Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha as his family priest. O King! Ik _s_\naku, the best of Kings, nursed him for the welfare of his own line; the more\nso, because to know that he was the Muni Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha; and thus he was very\npleased with him. Janamejaya! Thus I have described to you about the getting\nof another body by Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha, due to the curse of Nimi, and have also\ndescribed his re-birth in Mitra-Varu _n_ a\xc2\x92s family.\n\n\n\np. 534\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourteenth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the birth of Vas\xc2\x92i _st_\nha from Mitra Varu _n_ a in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 15](bk06ch15.htm)\n\n'
