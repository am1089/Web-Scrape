They now prepare a\nburial-place ( _s_ ma _s_ ana 3) for him,\n\np. 422\n\n[paragraph continues] (to serve him) either as a house or as a monument; for\nwhen any one dies, he is a corpse ( _s_ ava), and for that (corpse) food\n(anna) is thereby prepared, hence ' _s_ avanna,' for, indeed, ' _s_ avanna' is\nwhat is mystically called ' _s_ ma _s_ ana.' But ' _s_ ma _s_ a _h_ ' also are\ncalled the eaters amongst the Fathers, and they, indeed, destroy in yonder\nworld the good deeds of him who has had no sepulchre prepared for him: it is\nfor them that he prepares that food, whence it is ' _s_ ma _s_ anna,' for '\n_s_ ma _s_ anna' is what is mystically called ' _s_ ma _s_ ana.'\n\n13:8:1:22\\. Let him 1 not make it too soon (after the deceased man's death)\nlest he should freshen up his sin; but let him make it a long time after, as\nthereby he obscures the sin;--and when people do not even remember the years\n(that have passed 2), as thereby one causes the sin to pass into oblivion. If\nthey do remember 3,--\n\np. 423\n\n13:8:1:33\\. Let him make it in uneven years, since the uneven belongs to the\nFathers; and under a single Nakshatra 1, since the single Nakshatra belongs to\nthe Fathers; and at new-moon, since the new-moon is a single Nakshatra;--for\nhe (the Sacrificer) is a single (person); and in that all the beings dwell\ntogether during that night, thereby he obtains that object of desire which is\n(contained) in all Nakshatras.\n\n13:8:1:44\\. Let him make it in autumn, for the autumn is the Svadha, and the\nSvadha is the food of the Fathers: he thus places him along with food, the\nSvadha;--or in (the month of) Magha, thinking, 'Lest (ma) sin (agha) be in\nus;'--or in summer (nidagha), thinking, 'May thereby be removed (nidha) our\nsin (agha)!'\n\n13:8:1:55\\. Four-cornered (is the sepulchral mound). Now the gods and the\nAsuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_ apati, were contending in the (four)\nregions (quarters). The gods drove out the Asuras, their rivals and enemies,\nfrom the regions, and, being regionless, they were overcome. Wherefore the\npeople who are godly make their burial-places four-cornered, whilst those who\nare of the Asura nature, the Easterns and others 2, (make them)\n\np. 424\n\nround, for they (the gods) drove them out from the regions. He arranges it so\nas to lie between the two regions, the eastern and the southern 1, for in that\nregion assuredly is the door to the world of the Fathers: through the above he\nthus causes him to enter the world of the Fathers; and by means of the (four)\ncorners he (the deceased) establishes himself in the regions, and by means of\nthe other body 2 (of the tomb) in the intermediate regions: he thus\nestablishes him in all the regions.\n\n13:8:1:66\\. Now as to the choosing of the ground. He makes it on ground\ninclining towards the north, for the north is the region of men: he thus gives\nhim (the deceased) a share in the world of men; and in that respect, indeed,\nthe Fathers share in the world of men that they have offspring; and his (the\ndeceased man's) offspring will, indeed, be more prosperous.\n\n13:8:1:77\\. 'Let him make it on ground inclining towards the south,' they say,\n'for the world of the Fathers inclines towards the south: he thus gives him a\nshare in the world of the Fathers.' Let him not do so, however, for, indeed,\nsuch a one is an opening tomb, and certainly another of these (members of the\ndead man's family) quickly follows him in death.\n\np. 425\n\n13:8:1:88\\. And some, indeed, say, 'Let him make it on a counter-cutting 1 in\nground inclined towards the south, for such (a tomb) indeed becomes rising sin\n2.' But one must not do so, for indeed such (a burial place) alone becomes\nrising sin which one makes, on ground inclining towards the north.\n\n13:8:1:99\\. On any level (ground) where the waters, flowing thither from a\nsouth-easterly direction 3, and coming to a stand-still, will, on reaching\nthat (north-westerly) quarter, without pressing forward 4, join imperishable\nwater 5, on that (ground) one may make (the tomb); for, water being food, one\nthereby offers food to him from the front towards the back; and, water being\nthe drink of immortality, and that region between the rising of the seven _Ri_\nshis 6 and the setting of the sun being the quarter of the living, one thereby\nbestows the drink of immortality upon the living:--and such a one, indeed, is\na closing tomb; and verily what is good for the living that is also good for\nthe Fathers.\n\np. 426\n\n13:8:1:1010\\. Let him make it in a pleasant (spot), in order that there should\nbe pleasure for him; and in a peaceful (spot), in order that there should be\npeace for him. He must not make it either on a path, or in an open space, lest\nhe should make his (the deceased's) sin manifest.\n\n13:8:1:1111\\. Whilst being secluded it should have the sun shining on it from\nabove 1: in that it is secluded one hides his sin; and in that it has the sun\nshining on it from above---yonder sun being the remover of evil--he, indeed,\nremoves the evil from him, and he also causes him to be endowed with the\nradiance of the sun.\n\n13:8:1:1212\\. Let him not make it where it would be visible from here 2, for\nassuredly it is beckoning, and another of these (members of his family)\nquickly follows (the deceased) in death.\n\n13:8:1:1313\\. Let there be beautiful objects 3 at the back,--for beautiful\nobjects mean offspring: beautiful objects, offspring, will thus accrue to him.\nIf there be no beautiful objects, let there be water either at the back or on\nthe left (north) side, for water is indeed a beautiful object; and beautiful\nobjects, offspring, will indeed accrue to him.\n\n13:8:1:1414\\. He makes it on salt (barren) soil, for salt means seed; the\nproductive thus makes him partake in productiveness, and in that respect,\nindeed, the\n\np. 427\n\n[paragraph continues] Fathers partake in productiveness that they have\noffspring: his offspring assuredly will be more prosperous.\n\n13:8:1:1515\\. On such (ground) as is filled with roots, for to the Fathers\nbelongs the (sod) filled with roots;--it is (sod) of viri _n_ a (Andropogon\nmuricatus) and other grasses, for thus the Fathers' share in this (earth) is\nnot excessive 1; and he also thereby makes (the deceased's) sin to be\nrestricted 2.\n\n13:8:1:1616\\. Let him not put it near (where grows) Bhumipa _s_ a 3, or reeds,\nor A _s_ magandha 4, or Adhya _n_ _d_ a, or P _ri_ _s_ nipar _n_ i ('speckled-\nleaf,' Hemionitis cordifolia); nor let him make it near either an A _s_ vattha\n(Ficus religiosa), or a Vibhitaka (Terminalia bellerica), or a Tilvaka\n(Symplocos racemosa), or a Sphur _g_ aka (Diospyros embryopteris), or a\nHaridru (Pinus deodora), or a Nyagrodha (Ficus indica), or\n\np. 428\n\nany other (trees) of evil name 1, so as to avoid (such) names from a desire of\ngood luck.\n\n13:8:1:1717\\. Now as to the order of procedure. For an Agni _k_ it (builder of\na fire-altar) one makes the tomb after the manner of the fire-altar; for when\na Sacrificer builds a fire-altar he thereby constructs for himself by\nsacrifice a (new) body for yonder world; but that sacrificial performance is\nnot complete until the making of a tomb; and when he makes the tomb of the\nAgni _k_ it after the manner of the fire-altar, it is thereby he completes the\nAgni _k_ itya.\n\n13:8:1:1818\\. One must not make it (too) large lest he should make the sin (of\nthe deceased) large. 'Let him make it as large as the fire-altar without wings\nand tail,' say some, 'for like that of the fire-altar is this his (the\nSacrificer's) body.'\n\n13:8:1:1919\\. But let him rather make it just of man's size: he thus leaves no\nroom for another;--broader (variyas) behind 2, for what is (left) behind is\noffspring: he thus makes the (dead man's) offspring more excellent 3\n(variyas);--and broader on the left (north 4 or higher, uttara) side, for the\nlater (uttara)\n\np. 429\n\nare offspring: he thus makes the offspring more excellent. Having attended to\nthis, he encloses it with cords twisted (and extended) in the non-sunwise way\n1; for the (sacrificial) performance connected with the Fathers is done in the\nnon-sunwise way.\n\n13:8:1:2020\\. He then bids them cut out (the earth). He should cut it out to\nwhatever extent he intends to raise (the sepulchral mound), but let him rather\ncut it out so as to be just of man's size: he thus leaves no room for another.\nFor, on the one hand 2, the Fathers are the world of plants, and amongst the\nroots of plants they (are wont to) hide; and, on the other 2, (he does so)\nlest he (the deceased) should be separated from this (earth).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[421:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1118) The commentator is at pains to show that 'atha'\nhere has not the force of 'thereupon'--that is after the performance of the\nSarvamedha--but that of introducing a new topic ('Now, they do . . .'); and\nthat therefore the directions about to be given are by no means intended to\napply only to one who has performed the Sarvamedha, or even to the Agni _k_\nit, or builder of a fire-altar, but also to others.\n\n[421:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1119) Yaska (Nir. III, 5) resolves this word into '\n_s_ man' (body) + ' _s_ ayana' (couch); whilst Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p.\n189, proposes 'a _s_ man' (stone) + ' _s_ ayana' (couch). The _s_ ma _s_ ana;\nor burial-place, sepulchre, is constructed in the form of a tumulus, or grave-\nmound.\n\n[422:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1120) Viz. the Sacrificer, the performer of the\nfuneral rites, being the next of kin.\n\n[422:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1121) This is the way in which the scholiasts\ninterpret the corresponding rule, Katy. Sr. XXI, 3, 1 (pit _ri_ mdha _h_ sa\n_m_ vatsarasm _ri_ tau), instead of 'when they do not remember it (even once)\nfor years, he brings it about that the sin is forgotten, even in case they\nshould remember it,' as Prof. Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, p. 351 translates the\npassage. For the subject of the verb 'they remember it,' Prof. Delbruck\nsupplies 'pitara _h_ ,' i.e. the dead man's deceased ancestors, instead of the\nliving people, which seems rather improbable. The comment is very corrupt, but\nit makes at least some allusion to 'people's talk':--na _s_ ruti _h_ _s_\nrutyabhavas (ta _m_ ) tena _k_ irakara _n_ ena agha _m_ papakara _n_ a _m_\ngamayati, _k_ irat _s_ ma _s_ ana _m_ kurva _s_ rara _n_ a _m_ (? kurvata _h_\n_s_ rava _n_ a _m_ ) _g_ anavado\xe0\xa4\xbdpi na _s_ _ri_ _n_ otity (!) artha _h_.\n\n[422:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1122) In this way Harisvamin, as well as the\nscholiasts on Katy. XXI, 3, 2, construes the clause with the next paragraph,\nand it is difficult to see how otherwise any satisfactory sense could be\nextracted from it. At the same time, it can evidently only qualify the first\nspecification of time, as the others will apply in any case.\n\n[423:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1123) That is, a lunar mansion consisting of a single\nstar, such as _K_ itra and Pushya (in contradistinction to such in the dual,\nas Punarvasu and Vi _s_ akhe, and to those in the plural number, as the K _ri_\nttikas). As regards the symbolic connection of the uneven number with the\ndeceased ancestors, the commentator reminds us of the fact that it is the\nfather, grandfather, and great-grandfather who represent the Fathers.--The\nonly available MS. of the commentary (Ind. Off. 149) terminates at this place.\n\n[423:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1124) Ya asurya _h_ pra _k_ yas tvad ye tvat parima\n_n_ _d_ alani ( _s_ ma _s_ anani kurvate),--Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 189,\ntakes this in the sense of 'part of the pra _k_ ya, the asurya _h_ pra _g_ a\n_h_ of them (hence probably p. 424 the non-\xc3\x82ryan portion of them), have round\n_s_ ma _s_ ana.' J. Muir, Orig. Sansk. Texts, vol. ii, p. 485, takes no\naccount of the words 'tvad ye tvat.' For our rendering of these words, cp. V,\n3, 2, 2 _s_ udra _m_ s tvad ya _m_ s tvat, ' _S_ udras and others,' or ' _S_\nudras and suchlike people.'\n\n[424:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1125) That is to say, its front side is towards the\nsouth-east. Cp. p. 428, note 4.\n\n[424:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1126) That is, by means of the sides of the grave\nwhich are to face the intermediate points of the compass.\n\n[425:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1127) This is meant as a literal rendering of\n'pratyarsha.' What is intended thereby would seem to be either a cutting made\ninto southward sloping ground, in such a way as to make the cut piece of\nground rise towards the south, or perhaps such a part of the southward\ninclined ground as naturally rises towards the south. The St. Petersburg Dict.\nsuggests 'steep bank (escarpment), or side (of a hill).' Katy. XXI, 3, 15\n(kakshe) seems also to imply some kind of hollow ground, surrounded by bushes\nand trees.\n\n[425:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1128) That is, apparently, lightened, or improving,\nsin.\n\n[425:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1129) It might also mean, in a south-easterly\ndirection, but the comparison with food introduced into the mouth from the\nfront (east) and the specification of the opposite direction evidently point\nto the above meaning.\n\n[425:4](sbe44113.htm#fr_1130) That is, without urging forward the standing\nwater which they join, but quickly flowing into it.\n\n[425:5](sbe44113.htm#fr_1131) That is, apparently, such a lake as never dries\nup.\n\n[425:6](sbe44113.htm#fr_1132) That is, _Ursa major_ , the Great Bear, or\nCharles's Wain.\n\n[426:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1133) That is, it should be in a place where at midday\nthe rays of the sun do not fall obliquely on it, Katy. XXI, 3, 15 comm.\n\n[426:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1134) That is, from the village, cf. Katy. XXI, 3, 18.\n\n[426:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1135) Or, beautiful ground ( _k_ itra). According to\nthe comments on Katy. XXI, 3, 23 this means that the site of the grave should\nbe so chosen that there are at the back (or west) of it, either woods of\nvarious kinds, or ground diversified by woods, hills, temples (!) &c.\n\n[427:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1136) Whilst their share would have been excessive, if\nall the ground covered with vegetation were assigned to them. It is also\nworthy of note that Katy. Sr. XXV, 7, 17, in enumerating the plants which are\nto be removed from the site of the funeral pile, mentions (apparently in the\nplace of our Bhumipa _s_ a) the Vi _s_ akha, explained by the commentator as\nidentical with 'durva'; and Sir H. M. Elliott, Races of the N. W. Province of\nIndia, II, p. 303, remarks, on the Dub grass (Agrestis linearis, or Cynodon\ndactylon), that 'its tenacity whenever it once fixes its roots has caused it\nto be used in a common simile when the attachment of Zami\xe1\xb9\x85dars to their native\nsoil is spoken of.'\n\n[427:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1137) Apparently lit. 'binding (itself),'? i.e. either\nrestricted in quantity, or limited to his own person, not transmitted to his\nson. Cf. XIII, 8, 3, 10. It can hardly be taken in the sense of 'binding the\nsin.'\n\n[427:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1138) Literally, 'Earth-net,' apparently some\ntroublesome creeping plant corresponding to our rest-harrow (Ononis arvensis\nor spinosa), or couch-grass (Triticum repens), but of tropical dimensions.\n\n[427:4](sbe44113.htm#fr_1139) Lit. 'rock-smell,' perhaps identical with A _s_\nvagandha (lit. 'horse-smell,' Physalis flexuosa).\n\n[428:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1140) The commentator, on Katy. XXI, 3, 20, and Va\n_g_. S. XXXV, 1, instances the _s_ leshmantaka ('antiphlegmatic,' i.e. Cordia\nlatifolia or myxa) and the kovidara ('bad for splitting,' Bauhinia variegata;\nwhich, according to Stewart and Brandis, shows vertical cracks in the bark).\n\n[428:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1141) The grave being constructed in such a way that\nthe four corners lie in the direction of the four quarters, the back, or west\nside of the grave would really mean the side facing the north-west.\n\n[428:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1142) Or, perhaps, more extended, more numerous or\nprosperous.\n\n[428:4](sbe44113.htm#fr_1143) In reality, the north means here the side facing\nthe north-east. The side of the tumulus is to form a quadrilateral, of which\nthe two sides intersecting each other at the north corner, are to be longer\nthan the two which intersect at the south corner; viz. each of the p. 429\nformer is to measure one man's length plus 9\xc2\xbc a\xe1\xb9\x85gulas (thumb's breadths), and\neach of the latter one man's length minus 9\xc2\xbc a\xe1\xb9\x85gulas. See comm. on Va _g_. S.\nXXXV, 1.\n\n[429:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1144) That is, by twisting or spinning the strands\nfrom right to left, or contrary to the sun's course. The cord is extended\nround the grave from right to left (east, north, west, south) by means of pegs\ndriven into the ground at the four corners; see [XIII, 8, 4,\n1](sbe44116.htm#13:8:4:1).\n\n[429:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1146) I do not see how the usual force of 'atho'--viz.\nthat of introducing a new element or argument either analogous, or not quite\nconformable, to what precedes (cf. Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, p. 513)--can\napply to this double use of the particle. The two 'atho' seem to introduce the\nreasons for his digging up the ground, and for his not digging up more than a\nman's size.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 8, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe44114.htm)\n\n"
