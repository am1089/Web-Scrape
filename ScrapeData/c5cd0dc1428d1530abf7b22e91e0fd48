On one side of a stretch of water there is held a daily bazar; on\nthe other, a weekly market. During the rains when this piece of water gets\nconnected with the river, and boats can come through, great quantities of\ncotton yarns, and woollen stuffs for the coming winter, are brought in for\nsale.\n\nAt the height of our enthusiasm, Sandip laid it down that all foreign\narticles, together with the demon of foreign influence, must be driven out of\nour territory.\n\n"Of course!" said I, girding myself up for a fight.\n\n"I have had words with Nikhil about it," said Sandip. "He tells me, he does\nnot mind speechifying, but he will not have coercion."\n\n"I will see to that," I said, with a proud sense of power. I knew how deep was\nmy husband\'s love for me. Had I been in my senses I should have allowed myself\nto be torn to pieces rather than assert my claim to that, at such a time. But\nSandip had to be impressed with the full strength of my _Shakti_.\n\nSandip had brought home to me, in his irresistible way, how the cosmic Energy\nwas revealed for each individual in the shape of some special affinity.\nVaishnava Philosophy, he said, speaks of the _Shakti_ of Delight that dwells\nin the heart of creation, ever attracting the heart of her Eternal Lover. Men\nhave a perpetual longing to bring out this _Shakti_ from the hidden depths of\ntheir own nature, and those of us who succeed in doing so at once clearly\nunderstand the meaning of the music coming to us from the Dark. He broke out\nsinging:\n\n"My flute, that was busy with its song,  \nIs silent now when we stand face to face.  \nMy call went seeking you from sky to sky  \n   When you lay hidden;  \nBut now all my cry finds its smile  \n   In the face of my beloved."\n\nListening to his allegories, I had forgotten that I was plain and simple\nBimala. I was _Shakti_ ; also an embodiment of Universal joy. Nothing could\nfetter me, nothing was impossible for me; whatever I touched would gain new\nlife. The world around me was a fresh creation of mine; for behold, before my\nheart\'s response had touched it, there had not been this wealth of gold in the\nAutumn sky! And this hero, this true servant of the country, this devotee of\nmine--this flaming intelligence, this burning energy, this shining genius--him\nalso was I creating from moment to moment. Have I not seen how my presence\npours fresh life into him time after time?\n\nThe other day Sandip begged me to receive a young lad, Amulya, an ardent\ndisciple of his. In a moment I could see a new light flash out from the boy\'s\neyes, and knew that he, too, had a vision of _Shakti_ manifest, that my\ncreative force had begun its work in his blood. "What sorcery is this of\nyours!" exclaimed Sandip next day. "Amulya is a boy no longer, the wick of his\nlife is all ablaze. Who can hide your fire under your home-roof? Every one of\nthem must be touched up by it, sooner or later, and when every lamp is alight\nwhat a grand carnival of a _Dewali_ we shall have in the country!"\n\nBlinded with the brilliance of my own glory I had decided to grant my devotee\nthis boon. I was overweeningly confident that none could baulk me of what I\nreally wanted. When I returned to my room after my talk with Sandip, I loosed\nmy hair and tied it up over again. Miss Gilby had taught me a way of brushing\nit up from the neck and piling it in a knot over my head. This style was a\nfavourite one with my husband. "It is a pity," he once said, "that Providence\nshould have chosen poor me, instead of poet Kalidas, for revealing all the\nwonders of a woman\'s neck. The poet would probably have likened it to a\nflower-stem; but I feel it to be a torch, holding aloft the black flame of\nyour hair." With which he ... but why, oh why, do I go back to all that?\n\nI sent for my husband. In the old days I could contrive a hundred and one\nexcuses, good or bad, to get him to come to me. Now that all this had stopped\nfor days I had lost the art of contriving.\n\n### Nikhil\'s Story\n\n#### VI\n\nPanchu\'s wife has just died of a lingering consumption. Panchu must undergo a\npurification ceremony to cleanse himself of sin and to propitiate his\ncommunity. The community has calculated and informed him that it will cost one\nhundred and twenty-three rupees.\n\n"How absurd!" I cried, highly indignant. "Don\'t submit to this, Panchu. What\ncan they do to you?"\n\nRaising to me his patient eyes like those of a tired-out beast of burden, he\nsaid: "There is my eldest girl, sir, she will have to be married. And my poor\nwife\'s last rites have to be put through."\n\n"Even if the sin were yours, Panchu," I mused aloud, "you have surely suffered\nenough for it already."\n\n"That is so, sir," he naively assented. "I had to sell part of my land and\nmortgage the rest to meet the doctor\'s bills. But there is no escape from the\nofferings I have to make the Brahmins." What was the use of arguing? When will\ncome the time, I wondered, for the purification of the Brahmins themselves who\ncan accept such offerings?\n\nAfter his wife\'s illness and funeral, Panchu, who had been tottering on the\nbrink of starvation, went altogether beyond his depth. In a desperate attempt\nto gain consolation of some sort he took to sitting at the feet of a wandering\nascetic, and succeeded in acquiring philosophy enough to forget that his\nchildren went hungry. He kept himself steeped for a time in the idea that the\nworld is vanity, and if of pleasure it has none, pain also is a delusion.\nThen, at last, one night he left his little ones in their tumble-down hovel,\nand started off wandering on his own account.\n\nI knew nothing of this at the time, for just then a veritable ocean-churning\nby gods and demons was going on in my mind. Nor did my master tell me that he\nhad taken Panchu\'s deserted children under his own roof and was caring for\nthem, though alone in the house, with his school to attend to the whole day.\n\nAfter a month Panchu came back, his ascetic fervour considerably worn off. His\neldest boy and girl nestled up to him, crying: "Where have you been all this\ntime, father?" His youngest boy filled his lap; his second girl leant over his\nback with her arms around his neck; and they all wept together. "O sir!"\nsobbed Panchu, at length, to my master. "I have not the power to give these\nlittle ones enough to eat--I am not free to run away from them. What has been\nmy sin that I should be scourged so, bound hand and foot?"\n\nIn the meantime the thread of Panchu\'s little trade connections had snapped\nand he found he could not resume them. He clung on to the shelter of my\nmaster\'s roof, which had first received him on his return, and said not a word\nof going back home. "Look here, Panchu," my master was at last driven to say.\n"If you don\'t take care of your cottage, it will tumble down altogether. I\nwill lend you some money with which you can do a bit of peddling and return it\nme little by little."\n\nPanchu was not excessively pleased--was there then no such thing as charity on\nearth? And when my master asked him to write out a receipt for the money, he\nfelt that this favour, demanding a return, was hardly worth having. My master,\nhowever, did not care to make an outward gift which would leave an inward\nobligation. To destroy self-respect is to destroy caste, was his idea.\n\nAfter signing the note, Panchu\'s obeisance to my master fell off considerably\nin its reverence--the dust-taking was left out. It made my master smile; he\nasked nothing better than that courtesy should stoop less low. "Respect given\nand taken truly balances the account between man and man," was the way he put\nit, "but veneration is overpayment."\n\nPanchu began to buy cloth at the market and peddle it about the village. He\ndid not get much of cash payment, it is true, but what he could realize in\nkind, in the way of rice, jute, and other field produce, went towards\nsettlement of his account. In two months" time he was able to pay back an\ninstalment of my master\'s debt, and with it there was a corresponding\nreduction in the depth of his bow. He must have begun to feel that he had been\nrevering as a saint a mere man, who had not even risen superior to the lure of\nlucre.\n\nWhile Panchu was thus engaged, the full shock of the _Swadeshi_ flood fell on\nhim.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII](hw25.htm)\n\n'
