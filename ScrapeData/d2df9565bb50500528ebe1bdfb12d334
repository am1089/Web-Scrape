The ether is (Brahman), as it is designated as something different, &c.\n(from name and form).\n\nScripture says, 'He who is called ether, (aka _s_ a) is the revealer of all\nforms and names. That within which these\n\np. 233\n\nforms and names are contained is the Brahman, the Immortal, the Self ( _Kh_.\nUp. VIII, 14, 1).\n\nThere arising a doubt whether that which here is called ether is the highest\nBrahman or the ordinary elemental ether, the purvapakshin declares that the\nlatter alternative is to be embraced, firstly, because it is founded on the\nconventional meaning of the word 'ether;' and, secondly, because the\ncircumstance of revealing names and forms can very well be reconciled with the\nelemental ether, as that which affords room (for all things). Moreover, the\npassage contains no clear indicatory mark of Brahman, such as creative power,\nand the like.\n\nTo this we reply, that the word 'ether' can here denote the highest Brahman\nonly, because it is designated as a different thing, &c. For the clause, 'That\nwithin which these two are contained is Brahman,' designates the ether as\nsomething different from names and forms. But, excepting Brahman, there is\nnothing whatever different from name and form, since the entire world of\neffects is evolved exclusively by names and forms. Moreover, the complete\nrevealing of names and forms cannot be accomplished by anything else but\nBrahman, according to the text which declares Brahman's creative agency, 'Let\nme enter (into those beings) with this living Self ( _g_ iva atman), and\nevolve names and forms' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2). But--it may be said--from this\nvery passage it is apparent that the living Self also (i.e. the individual\nsoul) possesses revealing power with regard to names and forms.--True, we\nreply, but what the passage really wishes to intimate, is the non-difference\n(of the individual soul from the highest Self). And the very statement\nconcerning the revealing of names and forms implies the statement of signs\nindicatory of Brahman, viz. creative power and the like.--Moreover, the terms\n'the Brahman, the Immortal, the Self (VIII, 14) indicate that Brahman is\nspoken of.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 42](sbe34111.htm)\n\n"
