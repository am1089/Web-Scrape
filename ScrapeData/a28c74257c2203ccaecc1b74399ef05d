S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- This (Highest) Prak _r_ iti is recognised as\nfive-fold. When She is engaged in the work of Creation, She appears as :-- (1)\nDurga, the Mother of Ga _n_ es\xc2\x92a, (2) Radha, (3) Laksmi, (4) Sarasvati and (5)\nSavitri.\n\n\n\n2-3. Narada replied :-- O Thou, the best of J\xc3\xb1anins! Who is this Prak _r_ iti?\n(Whether She is of the nature of Intelligence or of matter?) Why did She\nmanifest Herself and then again why did She reveal Herself in these five\nforms? And what are Her characteristics? Now Thou oughtest to describe the\nlives of all, the different modes of their worship, and the fruits that are\naccrued thereby. Please also inform me which Forms of them manifested\nthemselves in which different places. Dost Thou please narrate to me all\nthese.\n\n\n\n4-18. Narayana said :-- \xc2\x93O Child! Who is there in this world that can describe\nfully the characteristics of Prak _r_ iti! However I will describe to you that\nmuch which I heard from my own father, Dharma. Hear. The prefix \xc2\x93Pra\xc2\x94 in the\nword Prak _r_ iti means exalted, superior, excellent; and the affix \xc2\x93K _r_\niti\xc2\x94 denotes creation. So the Goddess, the Devi Who is the most excellent in\nthe work of creation is known as the Devi Prak _r_ iti. To come closer :--\n\xc2\x93Pra\xc2\x94 signifies the Sattva Gu _n_ a, the most exalted quality, \xc2\x93K _r_ i\xc2\x94\ndenotes the Rajo Gu _n_ a and \xc2\x93Ti\xc2\x94 denotes the Tamo Gu _n_ a. (The Sattva Gu\n_n_ a is considered as the Highest as it is perfectly clear and free from any\nimpurities whatsoever; the Rajo Gu _n_ a is considered intermediate as it has\nthis defect :-- that it spreads a veil over the reality of things, so as not\nto allow men to understand the True Reality, while the Tamo Gu _n_ a is\nconsidered worst as it completely hides the Real Knowledge).\n\n\n\nSo when this Intelligence of the nature of Brahma, beyond the three\nattributes, gets tinged with the above three Gu _n_ as and becomes omnipotent,\nthen She is superior (Pradhana) in the work of creation. Hence She is styled\nas Prak _r_ iti.\n\n\n\np. 798\n\n\n\nO Child Narada! The state just preceding that of creation is denoted by \xc2\x93Pra\xc2\x94;\nand \xc2\x93K _r_ i\xc2\x94 signifies creation. So the Great Devi that exists before\ncreation is called Prak _r_ iti after creation. The Paramatma by His Yoga\n(i.e., Maya S\xc2\x92akti, the Holy Ghost) divided Himself into two parts; the right\nside of which was male and the left side was the female Prak _r_ iti.\n\n(Note :-- The Holy Ghost is the principle of Conception and Emanation,\nCreation). So the Prak _r_ iti is of the nature of Brahma. She is eternal. As\nthe fire and its burning power are not different, so there is no separate\ndistinction between \xc3\x82tman and His S\xc2\x92akti, between Puru _s_ a and Prak _r_ iti.\nTherefore those that are foremost and the highest of the Yogis do not\nrecognise any difference between a male and a female. All is Brahman. He is\neverywhere as male and female forever. There is nothing in this world that can\nexist for a moment even without this Brahman consisting of male and female.\n(i.e. they are Brahman with Maya manifested). Out of the Will of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_\na, to create the world Whose Will is all in all, came out at once the Mula\nPrak _r_ iti, the Great Devi \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92vari, (the Lady Controller of the Universe)\nBrahma with Maya in a state of equilibrium). By Her command came out five\nForms of Her, either for the purpose of creation or for bestowing Favour and\nGrace to the Bhaktas (devotees). Durga the Mother of Ga _n_ es\xc2\x92a, comes, as\nthe first, the most auspicious, loved by S\xc2\x92iva. She is Naraya _n_ i, Vi _sn_ u\nMaya, and of the nature of Pur _n_ a Brahma (the Supreme Brahma). This\neternal, all auspicious Devi is the Presiding Deity of all the Devas and is,\ntherefore, worshipped and praised by Brahma and the other Devas, Munis, and\nManus. This Bhagavati Durga Devi, (when She gets pleased) destroys all the\nsorrows, pains and troubles of the Bhaktas that have taken Her refuge, and\ngives them Dharma, everlasting name and fame, all auspicious things and bliss\nand all the happiness, nay, the Final Liberation! She is the Greatest Refugeof\nthese Bhaktas that come to Her wholly for protection and are in great\ndistress, whom She saves from all their dangers and calamities. In fact, know\nthis Durga Devi as, verily, the Presiding Deity of the heart of Kri _sn_ a and\nas His Highest S\xc2\x92akti, of the nature of the Holy Fire and the Holy Light. She\nis Omnipotent and resides always with Kri _sn_ a, the Great God. She is\nworshipped by all the Siddha Puru _s_ as (those that have attained success);\nthe (eighteen) Siddhis all go to Her and when pleased She gives whatever\nSiddhis (success) that Her Bhaktas want.\n\n\n\n19-40. This Great Devi is the intelligence, sleep, hunger, thirst, shadow,\ndrowsiness, fatigue, kindness, memory, caste, forbearance, errors, peace,\nbeauty, and consciousness, contentment, nourishment, prosperity, and\nfortitude. She is sung in the Vedas and in other S\xc2\x92astras\n\n\n\np. 799\n\n\n\nas the Maha Maya, of the nature of the Universe. In reality, She is the\nAll-S\xc2\x92akti of the Universe and She is the S\xc2\x92akti of Kri _sn_ a. All these\nqualities are also mentioned in the Vedas. What is mentioned here is a tithe\nmerely, in comparison to that of the Vedas. She has infinite qualities. Now\nhear of other S\xc2\x92aktis. The second S\xc2\x92akti of the Paramatman is named Padma (Lak\n_s_ mi). She is of the nature of S\xc2\x92uddha Sattva (Higher than Sattva Gu _n_ a)\nand is Kri _sn_ a\xc2\x92s Presiding Deity of all wealth and prosperity. This very\nbeautiful Lak _s_ mi Devi is the complete master of the senses; She is of a\nvery peaceful temper, of good mood and all-auspicious. She is free from greed,\ndelusion, lust, anger, vanity and egoism. She is devoted to Her husband and to\nHer Bhaktas; Her words are very sweet and She is very dear to Her husband,\nindeed, the Life and Soul of Him. This Devi is residing in all the grains and\nvegetables and so She is the Source of Life of all the beings. She is residing\nin Vaikun _t_ ha as Maha Laksmi, chaste and always in the service of Her\nhusband. She is the Heavenly Lak _s_ mi, residing in the Heavens and the royal\nLak _s_ mi in palaces and the Griha Lak _s_ mi in the several families of\nseveral householders. O Narada! All the lovely beauty that you see in all the\nliving beings and all the things, it is She; She is the glory and fame of\nthose that have done good and pious works and it is She that is the prowess of\nthe powerful kings. She is the trade of merchants, the mercy of the saints,\nengaged in doing good to others and the seed of dissensions in those sinful\nand vicious persons as approved of in the Vedas. She is worshipped by all,\nreverenced by all. Now I will describe to you about the third S\xc2\x92akti of the\nGreat God who is the Presiding Deity of knowledge, speech, intelligence, and\nlearning. This third S\xc2\x92akti is named Sarasvati. She is all the learning of\nthis endless Universe and She resides as medha (intelligence) in the hearts of\nall the human beings; She is the power in composing poetry; She is the memory\nand She is the great wit, light, splendour and inventive genius. She gives the\npower to understand the real meaning of the various difficult Siddhanta works;\nShe explains and makes us understand the difficult passages and She is the\nremover of all doubts and difficulties. She acts when we write books, when we\nargue and judge, when we sing songs of music; She is the time or measure in\nmusic; She holds balance and union in vocal and instrumental music. She is the\nGoddess of speech; She is the Presiding Deity in the knowledge of various\nsubjects; in argumentations and disputations. In fact all the beings earn\ntheir livelihood by taking recourse to Her. She is peaceful and holds in Her\nhands Vi _n_ a (lute) and books. Her nature is purely Sattvic (S\xc2\x92uddha\nSattva), modest and very loving to S\xc2\x92ri Hari. Her colour is white like ice-\nclad mountains, like that of the white sandal, like that of the Kunda flower,\nlike that of the Moon, or white lotus. She always repeats\n\n\n\np. 800\n\n\n\nthe name of Paramatma S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a while She turns Her bead composed of\njewels. Her nature is ascetic; She is the bestower of the fruits of the\nascetism of the ascetics; She is the Siddhi and Vidya of all; She grants\nalways success to all. Were She not here, the whole host of Brahmi _n_ s would\nalways remain speechless like the dead cluster of persons. What is recited in\nthe Vedas as the Third Devi is the Holy Word, The Third S\xc2\x92akti, Sarasvati.\nThus I have described Her. Now hear the glories of the other Devi in\naccordance with the Vedas. She is the mother of the four colours (castes), the\norigin of the (six) Vedamgas (the limbs of the Vedas and all the Chhandas, the\nSeed of all the mantrams of Sandhya vandanam and the Root, the Seed of the\nTantras; She Herself is versed in all the subjects. Herself an ascetic, She is\nthe Tapas of the Brahmi _n_ s; She is the Tejas (Fire) and the caste of the\nBrahmi _n_ caste and embodies in Herself all sorts of Samskaras (tendencies;\ninclinations); She is the Japam. Pure, known by the names of Savitri and\nGayatri, She resides always in the Brahma Loka (the Sphere of Brahma) and is\nsuch as all the sacred places of pilgrimages want Her touch for their\npurification.\n\n\n\n41-47. Her colour is perfectly white like the pure crystal. She is purely\nS\xc2\x92uddha Sattva, of the nature of the Highest Bliss; She is eternal and\nsuperior to all. She is of the nature of Para Brahma and is the bestower of\nMok _s_ a. She is the Fiery S\xc2\x92akti and the Presiding Deity of the Brahma Teja\n(the fiery spirit of Brahma, and the Brahma _n_ as). The whole world is\npurified by the touch of Whose Feet, this Savitri Devi is the Fourth S\xc2\x92akti. O\nChild Narada! Now I will describe to you about the Fifth S\xc2\x92akti, the Devi\nRadhika. Hear. She is the Presiding Deity of the five Pra _n_ as; She Herself\nis the Life of all; dearer than life even to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a; and She is\nhighly more beautiful and superior to all the other Prak _r_ iti Devis. She\ndwells in everything; She is very proud of Her good fortune (Saubhagyam); Her\nglory is infinite; and She is the wife, the left body, as it were, of S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a and She is not in any way inferior to Him, either in quality or in the\nTejas (Fiery Spirit) or in any other thing. She is higher than the Highest;\nthe Essence of all, infinitely superior, the First of all, Eternal, of the\nnature of the Highest Bliss, fortunate, highly respected, and worshipped by\nall. She is, the Presiding Devi of the Rasa Lila of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. From Her\nhas sprung the Rasa ma _nd_ alam and She is the Grace and the Ornament of the\nRasa ma _nd_ alam (the dance in a circle in Rasa).\n\n\n\n[Note :-- Extracts from a paper on Creation as explained by Hon\xc2\x92ble Justice\nSir G. Woodroffe.\n\nThe lecturer commenced by pointing out that an examination of any doctrine of\ncreation reveals two fundamental concepts: Those of Being\n\n\n\np. 801\n\n\n\n(Ku _t_ astha) and Becoming (Bhava); Changelessness and Change; the one and\nMany. The Brahman or Spirit in its own nature (Svarupa) is and never becomes.\nIt is the evolutes derived from the Principle of Becoming (Mula Prak _r_ iti)\nwhich constitute what is called Nature. The latter principle is essentially\nMovement. The world is displayed by consciousness (chit) in association with\nMula Prak _r_ iti in cosmic vibration (spandana). Recent Western hypotheses\nhave made scientific \xc2\x93matter\xc2\x94 into Maya in the sense that it is but the varied\nappearances produced in our mind by vibration of and in the single substance\nether. The doctrine of vibration (Spandana) is however in India an ancient\ninheritance. The whole world is born from the varied forms of the initial\nmovement in Mula Prak _r_ iti. The problem is how does such multiplicity exist\nwithout derogation to the essential unit of its efficient cause, the spirit?\nThe lecturer then made a rapid survey of the Sankhya philosophy on this point\nwhich assumes two real and independent principles of Being and Becoming which\nit calls Puru _s_ a and Prak _r_ iti and passed from this the easiest\ndualistic answer to the pure monism of S\xc2\x92ankara which asserted that there was\nbut one Principle of Being, the Sadvastu and Maya, whether considered as a\nS\xc2\x92akti of \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92vara or as the product of such S\xc2\x92akti was Avastu or nothing. He\nthen pointed out that the Tantrik doctrine with which he dealt occupied a\nmiddle position between those two points of view. S\xc2\x92iva in the Kularnava\nTantra says \xc2\x93Some desire Monism\xc2\x94 (Advaitavada), others Dualism (Dvaitavada).\nSuch, however, know not My Truth which is neither Monism nor Dualism\n(Dvaitadvaita Vivarjita). Tantra is not Dvaitavada for it does not recognise\nPrak _r_ iti as an independent unconscious principle (Achit). It differs from\nS\xc2\x92ankara\xc2\x92s Advaitavada in holding that Prak _r_ iti as a conscious principle\nof Becoming, that is as S\xc2\x92akti, is not Avastu, though its displayed picture,\nthe world is Maya. It effects a synthesis of the S\xc2\x92ankhya dualism by the\nconversion of the twin principles of Puru _s_ a and Prak _r_ iti into the\nunity which is the Ardhanaris\xc2\x92vara S\xc2\x92iva S\xc2\x92akti.\n\n\n\nAs regards other matters it adopts the notions of the Sankhya such as the\nconcepts of Mula Prak _r_ iti with the three Gu _n_ as, vibration (spandana),\nevolution (Parinama) of the Vikritis and the order of emanation of the\nTattvas. S\xc2\x92akti which effects this exists and is Herself never unconscious\n(Achit) though It has the power to make the Jiva think It is such. If this\nwere understood one would not hear such nonsense as that the S\xc2\x92aktas (whose\nreligion is one of the oldest in the world) worship material force or gross\nmatter (Ja _d_ a).\n\n\n\np. 802\n\n\n\nThe lecturer then shortly explained the nature of S\xc2\x92akti (S\xc2\x92akti Tattva), a\nterm which derived from the root \xc2\x93S\xc2\x92ak\xc2\x94 meant the Divine Power whereby the\nworld was created, manifested and destroyed. In Tantra the power and the Lord\nwho wields it (S\xc2\x92aktiman) are one and the same, S\xc2\x92iva and S\xc2\x92akti are one and\nthe same, S\xc2\x92iva is Brahman, S\xc2\x92akti is Brahman. The first is the transcendent,\nthe second the immanent aspect of the one Brahman, Who is both S\xc2\x92iva and\nS\xc2\x92akti. The Mother creates (Karya-Vibhavini). The Father wills what She does\n(Karya-Vibhavaka). From their union creation comes. S\xc2\x92akti is not like the\ndiminutive female figure which is seen on the lap of some Indian images, to\nwhich is assigned the subordinate position which some persons consider a Hindu\nwife should occupy. She is not a handmaid of the Lord but the Lord Himself in\nHer aspect as Mother of the worlds. This S\xc2\x92akti is both Nirgu _n_ a and Sagu\n_n_ a that is Chit S\xc2\x92akti and Maya S\xc2\x92akti.\n\n\n\nAfter this defining the nature of S\xc2\x92akti by which the world was created, the\nlecturer commenced an account of its manifestation as the universe, following\nin the main the S\xc2\x92arada Tilaka written in the eleventh century by\nLaksmanacharya, the guru of the celebrated Kashmiran Tantrik, Abhinava Gupta.\nThe following is a very abbreviated summary of this, the main portion of the\npaper. The lecturer first referred to the Aghanavastha state which was that Ni\n_s_ kala S\xc2\x92iva and touching upon the question why S\xc2\x92iva became Sakala\n(associated with Kala) and creative explained the term Kala and the theory of\nAdri _st_ asri _st_ i taught by the Tantra as by other S\xc2\x92astras. The former is\naccording to Sankhya, Mula Prak _r_ iti; according to Vedanta, Avidya and\naccording to the S\xc2\x92iva Tantra, S\xc2\x92akti. The latter is the doctrine that the\nimpulse to creation is proximately caused by the Karma of the Jivas. It is the\nseed of Karma which contains the germ of cosmic will to life. When Karma\nbecomes ripe, there arises the state called \xc3\x8ek _s_ a _n_ a and other names\nindicative of creative desire and will. There then takes place a development\nwhich is peculiar to the Tantra called Sadris\xc2\x92a Pari _n_ ama, which is a kind\nof Vivartta. The development is only apparent for there is no real change in\nthe \xc3\x82nandamaya Ko _s_ a. S\xc2\x92akti which exists in Sakala S\xc2\x92iva in a purely\npotential state is said to issue from Him. This is the first kinetic aspect of\nS\xc2\x92akti in which Sattagu _n_ a is displayed. This is the Paramaka _s_ avastha.\nNada (sound, word) then appears. S\xc2\x92akti becomes further kinetic through the\nenlivening of the Rajo Gu _n_ a. This is the Aksaravastha. Then under the\ninfluence of Tamas, \xc3\x8e _s_ vara becomes Ghanibhuta and what is called the\nParavindu. This is the Avyaktavastha. Thus the Supreme Vindu men call by\ndifferent names, Maha Vi _sn_ u, Brahma Puru _s_ a, or Devi. It is compared to\na grain of gram which under its sheath contains two seeds in undivided\n\n\n\np. 803\n\n\n\nunion. These are S\xc2\x92iva S\xc2\x92akti and their encircling sheath is Maya. This Vindu\nunfolds and displays itself, in the threefold aspect of Vindu, Vija, Nada; or\nS\xc2\x92iva, S\xc2\x92akti, and S\xc2\x92iva S\xc2\x92akti; the three S\xc2\x92aktis of will, knowledge and\naction. This is the mysterious Kama Kala which is the root of all Mantras.\nThese seven :-- Sakala, S\xc2\x92iva, S\xc2\x92akti, Nada, Paravindu, Vindu, Vija, Nada are\nall aspects of S\xc2\x92akti which are the seven divisions of the Mantra Om and\nconstitute what is called the creation of Para sound in the \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92vara creation.\n\n\n\nThe lecturer having explained the nature of these S\xc2\x92aktis which formed part of\nthe sound (S\xc2\x92abda), Sadri _s_ a Parinama, referred to the form or meaning\n(Artha) creation in the same development by the appearance of the six S\xc2\x92ivas\nfrom S\xc2\x92ambu to Brahma which were aggregate (Sama _st_ i) sound powers. It was\nhe said, on the differentiation of the Paravindu that there existed the\ncompleted causal S\xc2\x92abda which is the Hidden Word. The causal body or Para\nS\xc2\x92abda and Artha being complete, there then appeared the displayed word or\nS\xc2\x92abdartha. This is a composite like the Greek Logos. The S\xc2\x92abda Brahman or\nBrahman as cause of S\xc2\x92abda is the Chaitanya in all beings. The S\xc2\x92abdartha in\nthe Vedantin Namarupa or world of name and form of this S\xc2\x92abdartha the subtle\nand gross bodies are constituted, the S\xc2\x92aktis of which are the Hira _n_\nyagarbha sound, called Madhyama and the Vira _t_ sound Vaikhari. By S\xc2\x92abda is\nnot meant merely physical sound which as a quality of atomic ether is evolved\nfrom Tamasik Ahamkara.\n\n\n\nThe lecturer then pointed out that there had been Adri _st_ a Sri _st_ i up to\nthe appearance of S\xc2\x92akti and Vivartta development up to the completion of the\n\xc2\x93word\xc2\x94 or causal sound. Then there takes place real evolution (Pari _n_ ama)\nin which the Tattvas (or elements discovered as a result of psychological\nanalysis of our worldly experience) are said to emanate according to the\nSankhya and not the Vedantic scheme, though there were some peculiarities in\nthe Tantrik exposition which the lecturer noted. Finally Yogika Sri _st_ i was\naccepted in so far as it was the elements which in varied combinations made up\nthe gross world.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion the lecturer pointed out that Indian S\xc2\x92astra was a mutually\nconnected whole. Such peculiarities as existed in any particular S\xc2\x92astra were\ndue to a variety of standpoints or purpose in view. The main point in this\nconnection to be remembered was that the Tantra was practical S\xc2\x92adhana\nS\xc2\x92astra. Whilst S\xc2\x92ankara dealt with the subject from the standpoint of\nJ\xc3\xb1anakan _d_ a, the Tantra treated it from the point of view of worship\n(Upasanakan _d_ a) the Tantrik doctrine is compounded of various elements some\nof which it shared with other S\xc2\x92astras, some of which are its own, the whole\nbeing set forth according to a method and terminology which is peculiar to\nitself.]\n\n\n\np. 804\n\n\n\n48-70. She is the Lady of the Rasa Lila, the Foremost of the Jovial, humourous\n(witty) persons and dwells always in Rasa. Her abode is in Goloka and from Her\nhave come out all the Gopikas. Rasa \xc2\x96 the circular dance of Kri _sn_ a and the\ncow-herdesses of Vrindavana. Her nature is the Highest Bliss, the Highest\nContentment, and Excessive Joy; She transcends the three Sattva, Rajo and Tamo\nGu _n_ as and is Nirakara (without any particular form); but She dwells\neverywhere but unconnected with any. She is the soul of all. She is without\nany effort to do anything and void of Ahamkara. She assumes forms only to show\nHer favour to Her Bhaktas. The intelligent learned men (Pundits) read Her\nMahima (glories) in meditating on Her according to the Vedas. The chief of the\nDevas and the Munis could never see Her; Her clothings are fire-proof and She\nis decorated with many ornaments all over Her body. Her body looks as if the\ncrores of moons have risen all at once; She is the Giver of Bhakti (devotion)\ntowards Kri _sn_ a, services towards Kri _sn_ a; and She bestows all wealth\nand prosperity. In Varaha Kalpa, i.e., when the Varaha incarnation took place,\nShe incarnated Herself as the daughter of one Gopa (cow-herd), named\nVrisabhanu. And Earth was blessed by the touch of Her feet. She is such as\nBrahma and the other Devas could never perceive Her by any of their senses,\nyet everyone at Vrindavan saw Her very easily. She is the Gem amongst women.\nAnd when She is seen on the breast of Kri _sn_ a, it seems that lightnings\nflash in the blue mass of clouds in the sky. In days gone by, Brahma practised\nseveral austerities for sixty thousand years to purify Himself by seeing the\nnails of Her toe; but far from seeing that, He could not have that even in his\ndreams. At last He succeeded in seeing Her at Vrindavana and became blessed. O\nChild Narada! This is the fifth Prak _r_ iti and She is denominated as Radha.\nEvery female in every Universe is sprung from a part of S\xc2\x92ri Radha or part of\na part. O Narada! Thus I have described to you the five Highest Prakritis,\nDurga and others. Now I am going to describe those that are parts of these\nPrak _r_ itis. Hear. The Ganges, Ganga has sprung from the lotus feet of Vi\n_sn_ u; Her form is fluid-like; She is eternal. And She is the veritable\nburning fire to burn away the sins of the sinners. She is sweet to touch in\ntaking baths and in drinking; She gives final liberation to the Jivas, and\nleads easily to the Goloka abode. She is the holiest amongst the places of\npilgrimage and is the first of the running rivers. She is the rows of pearls\nin the clotted hairs of Mahadeva\xc2\x92s head and She is the Tapasya (asceticism)\nincarnate of the Tapasvis (ascetics) of the Bharata Var _s_ a. This Ganges\npurifies the three worlds and is the part of Mula Prak _r_ iti; She shines\nlike the Full Moon, is white like white lotus and like milk; She is pure\nS\xc2\x92uddha Sattva, clear, free from any Ahamkara, chaste and\n\n\n\np. 805\n\n\n\nbeloved of Narayana. The Tulasi Devi is the consort of Vi _sn_ u. She is the\nornament of Naraya _n_ a, and dwells always at the lotus feet of Narayana. By\nHer are performed all the acts of worship, all austerities, and all Sankalpas\n(resolves). She is the chief of all the flowers, holy and able to give merits\n(Pu _n_ yam) to others. At Her sight and touch, Nirva _n_ a can be obtained;\nand, were it not for Her, there could be no other fire in this Kali Yuga to\nburn the sins. She Herself is of the nature of Fire and at the touch of Whose\nlotus-feet, the earth is purified; all the Tirthas desire to have Her sight\nand touch for purification and without Her all acts in this world become\nfruitless. She bestows Mok _s_ a (liberation) to those who want final\nliberation, grants all sorts of desires to several people, Who Herself is like\na Kalpa Vrik _s_ a, Who is the Presiding Deity of all the trees in Bharata and\nWho has come here to grant satisfaction to the ladies of Bharata Var _s_ a and\nShe is considered very superior throughout all parts of India. This Tulasi\nDevi is the chief factor of Mula Prak _r_ iti.\n\n\n\n71-95. Then comes the Manasa Devi, the daughter of Kas\xc2\x92yapa. She is the dear\ndisciple of S\xc2\x92ankara and is therefore very learned in matters of S\xc2\x92astras. She\nis the daughter of Ananta Deva, the Lord of Snakes and is very much respected\nby all the Nagas. She Herself is very beautiful, the Lady of the Nagas, the\nmother of the Nagas and is carried by them. She is decorated with ornaments of\nthe Snakes; She is respected by the Nagendras and She sleeps on the bed of\nSnakes. She is Siddha Yogini, the devotee of Vi _sn_ u and always ready in the\nworship of Vi _sn_ u; She is the Tapas and the bestower of the fruits of\nTapas. Herself an ascetic, She spent three lakh years (according to the Deva\nmeasure) and has become the foremost of the ascetics in Bharatva _r_ sa. She\nis the Presiding Deity of all the mantras; Her whole body shines with\nBrahmateja (the Holy Fire of Brahma). Herself of the nature of Brahma, She\nagain meditates on Brahman. She is sprung from a part of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a and\nthe chaste wife of Jarat Karu Muni, the mother of \xc3\x82stika, the great Muni; She\nis the part of Mula Prak _r_ iti. O Child Narada! Now comes the S\xc2\x92a _st_ hi\nDevi, the Mother of Devasena. She is the most superior amongst the Gauri and\nthe sixteen Matrikas. This chaste woman is the giver of sons and grandsons in\nthe three worlds and the nurse, the foster mother of all. She is the sixth\npart of Mula Prak _r_ iti and is hence known by the name of S\xc2\x92a _st_ hi. She\nlives near to every child as an aged Yogini. Her worship is everywhere\nprevalent in the twelve months Vais\xc2\x92akha, etc. When the child gets born, on\nthe sixth day of Her worship is done in the lying-in-chamber and again on the\n21st day (after twenty days have passed away) the most auspicious worshipful\nceremony of Her is performed. The Munis bow down to Her with reverence and\nwant to visit Her daily.\n\n\n\np. 806\n\n\n\nShe protects all children always with a mother\xc2\x92s affectionate heart. This S\xc2\x92a\n_st_ hi Devi is again the part of Mula Prak _r_ iti. Then appears the Devi\nMangala Cha _nd_ ika. She goes from one house to another, on land or through\nwater or in air, doing great good to them; She has come out of the face of the\nPrak _r_ iti Devi and is doing always all sorts of good to this world. Her\nname is Mangala Cha _nd_ i because She is all auspicious at the time of\ncreation and assumes very furious angry appearance at the time of destruction.\nSo the Pundits say. On every Tuesday in all the worlds Her worship is done;\nand She, when pleased, gives to women sons, grandsons, wealth, prosperity,\nfame and good of all sorts and grants all desires. This Mangala Cha _nd_ i is\nagain the part of Mula Prak _r_ iti. Now comes the lotus-eyed Mahes\xc2\x92vari Kali\nwho when angry can destroy all this universe in a moment, who sprang from the\nforehead of the Mula Prak _r_ iti, Durga to slay the two demons S\xc2\x92umbha and\nNis\xc2\x92umbha. She is the half-portion of Durga and qualified like Her, fiery and\nenergetic. The beauty and splendour of whose body make one think as if the\nmillions of suns have arisen simultaneously. Who is the foremost of all the\nS\xc2\x92aktis and is more powerful than any of them, Who grants success to all the\npersons, Who is superior to all and is of Yogic nature, Who is exceedingly\ndevoted to Kri _sn_ a and like Him fiery, well-qualified, and valorous, Whose\nbody has become black by the constant meditation of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, Who can\ndestroy in one breath this whole Brahma _nd_ a, Who was engaged in fighting\nwith the Daityas simply for sport and instruction to the people and Who, when\npleased in worship can grant the four fruits Dharma, Artha, Kama and Mok _s_\na. This Kali is also the part of Prak _r_ iti. The Devi Basundhara (Earth) is\nagain the part of Mula Prak _r_ iti. Brahma and the other Devas, all the Muni\nma _nd_ alams (the spheres of Munis), fourteen Manus and all men sing hymns to\nHer. She is the support of all and filled with all sorts of grains. She is the\nsource of all gems and jewels, She bears in Her womb all the precious metals.\nAll sorts of best things issue from Her. She is the Refuge of all. The\nsubjects and kings worship Her always and chant hymns to Her. All the Jivas\nlive through Her and She bestows all sorts of wealth and prosperity. Without\nHer, all this, moving or non-moving, become void of any substratum. Where to\nrest on!\n\n\n\n96-143. O Child Narada! Now hear about them who are issued again from the\nparts of Mula Prak _r_ iti as well as the names of their wives. I will now\nnarrate duly. The Devi \xc2\x93Svaha\xc2\x94 is the wife of Agni (Fire), and the whole\nUniverse worships Her. Without her, the Devi can never take any oblations. Dak\n_s_ i _n_ a and Diksa are both the wives of Yaj\xc3\xb1a (Sacrifice). They are\nhonoured everywhere. So much so that without Dak _s_ i _n_ a (the fees given\nat the end of the Sacrifice) no sacrificial ceremonies\n\n\n\np. 807\n\n\n\ncan be complete and fructifying. The Devi \xc2\x93Svadha\xc2\x94 is the wife of the Pitris.\nAll worship this Devi \xc2\x93Svadha\xc2\x94 whether they are Munis, Manus, or men. If this\nmantra \xc2\x93Svadha\xc2\x94 be not uttered while making an offering to the Pitris, all\nturn out useless. The Devi \xc2\x93Svasti\xc2\x94 is the wife of the Vayu Deva; She is\nhonoured everywhere in the Universe. Without this \xc2\x93Svasti\xc2\x94 Devi, no giving nor\ntaking nor any action can be fructifying and useful. \xc2\x93Pu _st_ i\xc2\x94 (nourishment)\nis the wife of Ga _n_ apati. All in this world worship this Pu _st_ i Devi.\nWithout this \xc2\x93Pu _st_ i\xc2\x94, women or men alike all become weaker and weaker. Tu\n_st_ i (satisfaction, contentment) is the wife of Ananta Deva. She is praised\nand worshipped everywhere in this world. Without Her no one anywhere in the\nworld can be happy. \xc2\x93Sampatti\xc2\x94 is the wife of \xc3\x8esana Deva. The Suras, the men\nall alike worship Her. Were it not for Her, all in this world would be\noppressed with dire poverty. The Devi \xc2\x93Dhriti\xc2\x94 is the wife of Kapila Deva. She\nis honoured equally in all places. Were it not for Her, all the people in this\nworld would have become impatient. The \xc2\x93Sati\xc2\x94 Devi is the wife of Satya Deva\n(Truth). She is endearing to the whole world. The liberated ones worship Her\nalways. Were it not for the truth loving Sati, the whole world would have lost\nthe treasure in friendship. \xc2\x93Daya\xc2\x94 (Mercy) endearing to the whole world is the\nchaste wife of \xc2\x93Moha Deva\xc2\x94. She is liked by all. Were it not for Her, all the\nworld would have become hopeless. The Devi \xc2\x93Prati _st_ ha\xc2\x94 (fame, celebrity)\nis the wife of Pu _n_ ya Deva (merit).She gives merits to persons according as\nthey worship Her. Were it not for Her, all the persons would remain dead while\nliving. The Devi \xc2\x93Kirti\xc2\x94 (fame) is the wife of Sukarma (good works). Herself a\nSiddha (one who has acquired the result of one\xc2\x92s success), all the blessed\npeople honour Her with great reverence. Were it not for Her, all the persons\nin this world would have been dead, devoid of any fame. Kriya (work-efforts,\naction, doing) is the wife of \xc2\x93Udyoga\xc2\x94 (enthusiasm). All honour Her greatly. O\nMuni Narada! Were it not for Her, the whole people would be void of any rules\nand regulations. Falsehood is the wife of Adharma (unrighteousness). She is\nhonoured greatly by all the cheats that are extant in this world. Were she not\nliked by them, then all the cheats would become extinct. She did not fall in\nthe sight of anybody in the Satya Yuga. Her subtle form became visible in the\nTreta Yuga. When the Dvapara Yuga came, She became half developed. And at last\nwhen the Kali Yuga has come, She is fully developed and there is no second to\nHer whether in bold confidence and shamelessness or in talking much and\npervading everywhere. With her brother Deceitfulness, She roams from one house\nto another. Peace and modesty and shame are both the wives of good behaviour.\nWere they not existent, all in this\n\n\n\np. 808\n\n\n\nworld would have turned out deluded and mad. Intelligence, genius and\nfortitude, these three are the wives of J\xc3\xb1ana (knowledge). Had they not lived,\nevery one would become stupid and insane. Murti is the wife of Dharma Devi.\nShe is of the nature of Beauty to all and very charming. Were it not for Her,\nParamatman would not get any resting place; and the whole universe would have\nbecome Niralamba (without anything to rest). This chaste Murti Devi is of the\nnature of splendour, loveliness and Lak _s_ mi. She is everywhere respected,\nworshipped and reverenced. \xc2\x93Sleep\xc2\x94, the Siddha Yogini, is the wife of Rudra\nDeva, who is of the nature of Kalagni (the universal conflagration at the\nbreak-up of the world). All the Jivas spend their nights with Her. The\ntwilights, night and day are the wives of Kala (Time). If they were not, the\nCreator even would not be able to reckon time. Hunger and thirst are the wives\nof Lobha (covetousness). They are thanked, respected and worshipped by the\nwhole world. Had they not lived, the whole world would have merged ever in an\nocean of anxieties. Splendour and burning capacity are the wives of Tejas\n(fire). Without these, the Lord of the world could never have created and\nestablished order in this universe. Death and old age are the daughters of the\nKala, and the dear wives of Jvara (the disease). Without these, all the\ncreation would come to an end. The Tandra (drowsiness, lassitude) and Priti\n(satisfaction) are the daughters of Nidra (sleep). And they are the dear wives\nof Sukha (pleasure). They are present everywhere in this world. O Best of\nMunis! S\xc2\x92raddha (faith) and Bhakti (devotion) are the wives of Vairagyam\n(dispassion). For then all the persons can become liberated while living\n(Jivanmuktas). Besides these there is Aditi, the Mother of the Gods, Surabhi,\nmother of cows; Diti, the mother of the Daityas; Kadru, the mother of the\nNagas (serpents); Vinata, the mother of Ga _r_ u _d_ a, the prince of birds;\nand Danu, the mother of the Danavas. All are very useful for the purpose of\ncreation. But these all are parts of Mula Prak _r_ iti. Now I will mention\nsome of the other parts of Prak _r_ iti. Hear. Rohi _n_ i, the wife of the\nMoon, Sanj\xc3\xb1a, the wife of the Sun; S\xc2\x92atarupa, the wife of Manu; S\xc2\x92achi, the\nwife of Indra; Tara, the wife of Brihaspati; Arundhati, the wife of Vas\xc2\x92i _st_\nha; Anasuya, the wife of Atri; Devahuti, the wife of Kardama; Prasuti, the\nwife of Dak _s_ a; Menaka, the mind born daughter of the Pitris and the mother\nof Ambika, Lopamudra, Kunti, the wife of Kuvera, the wife of Varu _n_ a,\nBindhyavali, the wife of the King Bali; Damayanti, Yas\xc2\x92oda, Devaki, Gandhari,\nDraupadi, S\xc2\x92aivya, Satyavati, the chaste and noble wife of Bri _s_ abhanu and\nthe mother of Radha; Mandidari; Kaus\xc2\x92alya, Kauravi,; Subhadra; Revati,\nSatyabhama, Kalindi, Laksmana; Jambavati; Nagnajiti, Mitrabinda,\n\n\n\np. 809\n\n\n\nLak _s_ a _n_ a, Rukmi _n_ i, Sita, the Laksmi incarnate; Kali, Yojana Gandha,\nthe chaste mother of Vyasa, \xc3\x9b _s_ a, the daughter of Va _n_ a, her companion\nChitralekha; Prabhavati, Bhanumati, the Sati Mayavati, Re _n_ uka, the mother\nof Paras\xc2\x92urama; Rohi _n_ i, the mother of Balarama, Ekananda and the sister of\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, Sati Durga and many other ladies are the parts of Prak _r_\niti and all the female sex, everywhere in the Universe are all come from the\nparts of Prak _r_ iti. So to insult any woman is to insult the Prak _r_ iti.\nIf one worships a chaste Brahmi _n_ woman, who has her husband and son living,\nwith clothings, ornaments, and sandal paste, etc., one worships, as it were,\nPrak _r_ iti. If any Vipra worships a virgin girl, eight years old, with\nclothings, ornaments and sandal paste, know that he has worshipped the Prak\n_r_ iti Devi. The best, middling, and worst are all sprung from Prak _r_ iti.\nThose women that are sprung from Sattva Gu _n_ a are all very good natured and\nchaste; those that are sprung from Rajo Gu _n_ a are middling and very much\nattached to worldly enjoyments and do their selfish ends and those that are\nsprung from Tamo Gu _n_ a are recognised as worst and belonging to the unknown\nfamilies. They are very scurrilous, cheats, ruining their families, fond of\ntheir own free ways, quarrelsome and no seconds are found equal to them. Such\nwomen become prostitutes in this world and Apsaras in the Heavens. The\nHermaphrodites are parts of Prak _r_ iti but they are of the nature of Tamo Gu\n_n_ as.\n\n\n\n144-159. Thus I have described to you the nature of Prak _r_ iti. So in this\nPunyabhumi Bharata Var _s_ a, to worship the Devi is by all means desirable.\nIn days past by, the King Suratha worshipped the Mula Prak _r_ iti Durga, the\nDestructrix of all evils. Then again S\xc2\x92ri Rama Chandra worshipped Her when he\nwanted to kill Rava _n_ a. Since then Her worship is extant in the three\nworlds. She was first born as the honourable daughter of Dak _s_ a. She\ndestroyed the whole hosts of Daityas and Danavas. It was She who, hearing the\nabusive words uttered against Her husband at the Yaj\xc3\xb1a by Dak _s_ a, Her\nfather, gave up Her body and took up again Her birth. She took Her birth in\nthe womb of Menaka and got again Pas\xc2\x92upati as Her husband. And of the two\nsons, Kartika and Ga _n_ es\xc2\x92a, born to Her, Kartika was the A _n_ sa (part) of\nNarayana and Ga _n_ apati was S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a Himself, the Lord of Radha. O\nDevar _s_ i! After the two sons, Laksmi Devi came out of Durga. Mangala Raja,\nthe King Mars first worshipped Her. Since then, all in the three worlds began\nto worship Her, whether they are Devas or men. The King As\xc2\x92vapati first\nworshipped Savitri Devi; and since then the Devas, Munis, all began to worship\nHer. When the Devi Saravasti was born, the Bhagavan Brahma first worshipped\nHer; next the greatest Munis, Devas all began\n\n\n\np. 810\n\n\n\nto worship Her. On the full moon night of the month of Kartik, it was Bhagavan\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, The Highest Spirit, that worshipped, first of all, the Devi\nRadha within the Rasa Mandalam, the enclosure, within which the Rasa Lila was\nperformed (the circular dance) in the region Goloka. Then under the command of\nS\xc2\x92ri Krisna, all the Gopas (cow-herds), Gopis, all the boys, girls, Surabhi,\nthe queen of the race of the cows, and the other cows worshipped Her. So since\nHer worship by the inhabitants of Goloka, by Brahma and the other Devas and\nthe Munis, all began to worship ever S\xc2\x92ri Radha with devotion and incense,\nlight and various other offerings. On earth She was first worshipped by\nSuyaj\xc3\xb1a, in the sacred field of Bharatvar _s_ a, under the direction of\nBhagavan Mahadeva. Subsequently, under the command of the Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a, the Highest Spirit, the inhabitants of the three worlds began to\nworship Her. The Munis with great devotion, with incense, flowers and various\nother offerings worship always the Devi Radha. O Child Narada! Besides these,\nall the other Devis that have issued from Prak _r_ iti Devi are all\nworshipped. So much so that in the villages, the village Deities, in the\nforests, the forest Deities and in the cities, the city Deities are\nworshipped. Thus I have described to you all according to the S\xc2\x92astras the\nglorious lives of the Devi Prak _r_ iti and Her parts. What more do you want\nto hear?\n\n\n\nHere ends the First Chapter on the Description of Prakriti in the Ninth Book\nof the S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk09ch02.htm)\n\n'
