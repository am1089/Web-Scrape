When she did not find Krishnu there, being agitated in mind,\nJusodha went about calling out, and repeating the name of Mohun--"Where has he\ngone, that was tied down? Has any one seen my boy Kunhya any where?" In the\nmeantime, (or at this time,) a woman of Bruj, having come before Jusodha,\nsaid, "Two trees have fallen down, and there Krishnu has escaped."\n\nHaving heard this, they all advanced and saw that two trees had indeed fallen\ndown, uprooted, and Krishnu was sitting between them, tied to the wooden\nmortar, and contracted in size. Going up to him, Nund\'s wife, loosing him from\nthe wooden mortar, and weeping, clasped Krishnu to her bosom; and all the\ncowherdesses, supposing that he was alarmed, began to snap their fingers, and\nclap their hands to make Krishnu laugh. Upon this, Nund and Oopnund began to\nsay to each other, "How have these trees, which have been growing up for ages,\nfallen down, uprooted; this strange occurrence cannot be understood, nor is\nthe secret of it comprehensible."\n\np. 48\n\n[paragraph continues] Having heard this, a young boy explained the\ncircumstances of the trees falling, exactly as they had occured; but no one\ncould understand them. One said, "How can these children understand such a\nsecret as this?" Another said, "Perhaps it may be so, for who can comprehend\nthe state of Huri?" Thus making remarks of various kinds, and taking Shree\nKrishnu with them, they all came with delight to Gokool: then Nund Jee gave\nmany presents, and performed many charitable acts. After the lapse of some\ndays, Krishnu\'s birth-day came round: Jusodha sent an invitation to all their\nrelations; and having given an entertainment, tied the anniversary birth-day\nknot. When they all sat down to eat, Nund Rae said, "Brethren! how can we\npossibly remain in Gokool? Every day, many acts of injustice are committed;\nlet us go somewhere, where we can have grass and water"--Oopnund said, "If you\ngo and live at Brindabun, you will live there with delight." Having heard this\nspeech, Nund Jee entertaining them all, and giving them seats after\ndistributing pawn, sent for an astrologer, and enquired the proper division of\ntime of (48) forty-eight minutes for the journey. He, considering, said, "To-\nmorrow is a very good day for a journey in that direction; the spirits,\nattendant on good and bad luck, are on the left; the unlucky quarter is behind\nus, and the moon before us: you may start off early in the morning without any\nanxiety." Having heard this, all the cowherdesses and cowherds went to their\nhomes, but early in the morning they all assembled together, having packed up\nall their goods and chattels on carts. Nund Jee also accompanied them, with\nall his relations; and proceeding on their journey, and crossing the river,\nthey arrived in the evening. Having propitiated the goddess Toolsee, they\noccupied Brindabun; and all began to live there with ease and pleasure.\n\nWhen Shree Krishnu was five years old, he said to his mother, "I will go out\nto graze the calves; tell Buldao not\n\np. 49\n\nto leave me alone in the jungle." She replied, "Son! there are many servants\nof yours, whose business it is to take the calves out to graze; do not you go,\nwho are the protection of my eye-lids, and dearer to me than my eyes." Krishnu\nsaid, "If I am allowed to go into the jungle to amuse myself, I will eat my\nfood; if not, I will not." On hearing this, Jusodha having called the\ncowherds\' children, and entrusted Krishnu and Bulram to them, said, "Do not go\nfar to graze the calves, and bring them both home together before evening. Do\nnot leave them by themselves in the jungle; remain with them; you are their\nguardians." Saying this, and giving them food, she made over Ram and Krishnu\nto them. They having gone to the banks of the Jumna, began to graze the calves\nand to play with the cowherds\' children. At this time, Buchasoor, who had been\nsent by Kuns, came there under a disguised form: on seeing him, the frightened\ncalves ran off in all directions. Upon this, Shree Krishnu remarked to Buldeo\nwith a wink, "Brother! this is some demon that has come here." Afterwards,\nwhen in the act of feeding he approached near to accomplish his treacherous\ndesign (lit: to arrange his ambuscade,) Shree Krishnu having seized him by the\nhind leg, and twisted him round his head, dashed him down with such violence,\nthat life left his body. Having heard of the death of Buchasoor, Kuns sent\nBukasoor, who having come to Brindabun, and arranged his snare, went and sat\non the bank of the Jumna, in the appearance of a hill--On beholding him, the\ncowherds began, through fear, to say to Krishnu, "Brother! this is some demon,\nwho has come in the form of a crane; how shall we escape from him?" On the one\nhand, the cowherds were speaking thus to Krishnu; on the other, the demon was\nrevolving in his mind, "That he would certainly destroy Krishnu on that day."\nIn the meantime, when Shree Krishnu went near him, he raised him up with his\nbill, and shut his mouth. The cowherds\' children being perplexed, looking\nround on all sides and crying, began to call out, and say, "Alas! alas!\n\np. 50\n\n[paragraph continues] Huldhur too is not here, what shall we go and tell\nJusodha?" Seeing that they were greatly distressed, Shree Krishnu became so\nhot, that the crane could not retain him in his mouth. When the crane vomited\nhim out, Krishnu having seized his beak, and pressed it under his feet, tore\nit in pieces; and collecting the calves, he returned home with his companions,\nlaughing and playing.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIII](psa14.htm)\n\n'
