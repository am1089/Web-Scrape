XXIII.\n\nBirth of Kalayavana: he advances against Mathura. Krishn\xcc\x81a builds Dwaraka, and\nsends thither the Yadava tribe: he leads Kalayavana into the cave of\nMuchukunda: the latter awakes, consumes the Yavana king, and praises Krishn\xcc\x81a.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--\xc5\x9ayala having called Gargya the Brahman, whilst at the cow-pens,\nimpotent, in an assembly of the Yadavas, they all laughed; at which he was\nhighly offended, and repaired to the shores of the western sea, where he\nengaged in arduous penance to obtain a son, who should be a terror to the\ntribe of Yadu. Propitiating Mahadeva, and living upon iron sand for twelve\nyears, the deity at last was pleased with him, and gave him the desired boon.\nThe king of the Yavanas, who was childless, became the friend of Gargya; and\nthe latter begot a son by his wife, who was as black as a bee, and was thence\ncalled Kalayavana 1. The Yavana king having placed his son, whose breast was\nas hard as the point of the thunderbolt, upon the throne, retired to the\nwoods. Inflated with conceit of his prowess, Kalayavana demanded of Narada who\nwere the most mighty heroes on earth. To which the sage answered, "The\nYadavas." Accordingly Kalayavana assembled many myriads of Mlechchhas and\nbarbarians 2, and with a vast armament of\n\np. 566\n\nelephants, cavalry, chariots, and foot, advanced impatiently against Mathura\nand the Yadavas; wearying every day the animal that carried him, but\ninsensible of fatigue himself.\n\nWhen Krishn\xcc\x81a knew of his approach, he reflected that if the Yadavas\nencountered the Yavana, they would be so much weakened by the conflict, that\nthey would then be overcome by the king of Magadha; that their force was much\nreduced by the war with Magadha, whilst that of Kalayavana was unbroken; and\nthat the enemy might be therefore victorious. Thus the Yadavas were exposed to\na double danger. He resolved therefore to construct a citadel for the Yadu\ntribe, that should not be easily taken; one that even women might defend, and\nin which therefore the heroes of the house of Vrishn\xcc\x81i should be secure; one\nin which the male combatants of the Yadavas should dread no peril, though he\nhimself should be drunk or careless, asleep or abroad. Thus reflecting,\nKrishn\xcc\x81a solicited a space of twelve furlongs from the ocean, and there he\nbuilt the city of Dwaraka 3, defended by high ramparts, and beautified with\ngardens and reservoirs of water, crowded with houses and buildings, and\nsplendid as the capital of Indra, Amaravati. Thither Janarddana conducted the\ninhabitants of Mathura, and then awaited at that city the approach of\nKalayavana.\n\nWhen the hostile army encamped round Mathura, Krishn\xcc\x81a unarmed went forth, and\nbeheld the Yavana king. Kalayavana, the strong-armed, recognizing Vasudeva,\npursued him; him whom the thoughts of perfect ascetics cannot overtake. Thus\npursued, Krishn\xcc\x81a entered a large cavern, where Muchukunda, the king of men,\nwas asleep. The rash Yavana entering the cave, and beholding a man lying\nasleep there, concluded it\n\np. 567\n\nmust be Krishn\xcc\x81a, and kicked him; at which Muchukunda awoke, and casting on\nhim an angry glance, the Yavana was instantly consumed, and reduced to ashes.\nFor in a battle between the gods and demons, Muchukunda had formerly\ncontributed to the defeat of the latter; and, being overcome with sleep, he\nsolicited of the gods as a boon that he should enjoy a long repose. "Sleep\nlong and soundly," said the gods; "and whoever disturbs you shall be instantly\nburnt to ashes by fire emanating from your body 4."\n\nHaving burnt up the iniquitous Yavana, and beholding the foe of Madhu,\nMuchukunda asked him who he was. "I am born," he replied, "in the lunar race,\nin the tribe of Yadu, and am the son of Vasudeva." Muchukunda, recollecting\nthe prophecy of old Garga, fell down before the lord of all, Hari, saying,\n"Thou art known, supreme lord, to be a portion of Vishn\xcc\x81u; for it was said of\nold by Garga, that at the end of the twenty-eighth Dwapara age Hari would be\nborn in the family of Yadu. Thou art he, without doubt, the benefactor of\nmankind; for thy glory I am unable to endure. Thy words are of deeper tone\nthan the muttering of the rain cloud; and earth sinks down beneath the\npressure of thy feet. As in the battle between the gods and demons the Asuras\nwere unable to sustain my lustre, so even am I incapable of bearing thy\nradiance. Thou alone art the refuge of every living being who has lighted on\nthe world. Do thou, who art the alleviator of all distress, shew favour upon\nme, and remove from me all that is evil. Thou art the oceans, the mountains,\nthe rivers, the forests: thou art earth, sky, air, water, and fire: thou art\nmind, intelligence, the unevolved principle, the vital airs, the lord of life\n--the soul; all that is beyond the soul; the all-pervading; exempt from the\nvicissitudes of birth; devoid of sensible\n\np. 568\n\nproperties, sound and the like; undecaying, illimitable, imperishable, subject\nneither to increase nor diminution: thou art that which is Brahma, without\nbeginning or end. From thee the immortals, the progenitors, the Yakshas,\nGandharbhas, and Kinnaras, the Siddhas, the nymphs of heaven, men, animals,\nbirds, deer, reptiles, and all the;, vegetable world, proceed; and all that\nhas been, or will be, or is now, moveable or fixed. All that is amorphous or\nhas form, all that is subtile, gross, stable, or moveable, thou art, O creator\nof the world; and beside thee there is not any thing. O lord, I have been\nwhirled round in the circle of worldly existence for ever, and have suffered\nthe three classes of affliction, and there is no rest whatever. I have\nmistaken pains for pleasures, like sultry vapours for a pool of water; and\ntheir enjoyment has yielded me nothing but sorrow. The earth, dominion,\nforces, treasures, friends, children, wife, dependants, all the objects of\nsense, have I possessed, imagining them to be sources of happiness; but I\nfound that in their changeable nature, O lord, they were nothing but vexation.\nThe gods themselves, though high in heaven, were in need of my alliance. Where\nthen is everlasting repose? Who without adoring thee, who art the origin of\nall worlds, shall attain, O supreme deity, that rest which endures for ever?\nBeguiled by thy delusions, and ignorant of thy nature, men, after suffering\nthe various penalties of birth, death, and infirmity, behold the countenance\nof the king of ghosts, and suffer in hell dreadful tortures, the reward of\ntheir own deeds. Addicted to sensual objects, through thy delusions I revolve\nin the whirpool of selfishness and pride; and hence I come to thee, as my\nfinal refuge, who art the lord deserving of all homage, than whom there is no\nother asylum; my mind afflicted with repentance for my trust in the world, and\ndesiring the fulness of felicity, emancipation from all existence."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[565:1](vp140.htm#fr_1525) This legend of the origin of Kalayavana is given\nalso by the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba. The Bhagavata, like our text, comes\n[at](errata.htm#23) once to the siege of Mathura by this chief; but the Hari\nVan\xc5\x9ba suspends the story, for more than thirty chapters, to narrate an origin\nof the Yadavas, and sundry adventures of Krishn\xcc\x81a and Rama to the south-west.\nMost of these have no other authority, and are no doubt inventions of the\nDakhini compiler; and the others are misplaced.\n\n[565:2](vp140.htm#fr_1526) So the Bhagavata describes him as leading a host of\nMlechchhas, or barbarians, against Krishn\xcc\x81a; but in the Mahabharata, Sabha\nParvan, vol. I. p. 330, where Krishn\xcc\x81a describes the power of Jarasandha, he\nadmits that he and the Yadavas fled from Mathura to the west, through fear of\nthat king, but no account is given of any siege of Mathura by Kalayavana. The\nonly indication of such a person is the mention that Bhagadatta, the Yavana\nking, who rules over Muru and Naraka in the west and south, is one of his most\nattached feudatories. This king is in various other places called king of\nPragjyotish, as he is in a subsequent passage of the same book, Sabha P., p.\n374; and this name is always applied to the p. 566 the west of Asam. His\nsubjects are, however, still Yavanas and Mlechchhas, and he presents horses,\ncaps set with jewels, and swords with ivory hilts; articles scarcely to be\nfound in Asam, which cannot well be the seat of his sovereignty. It seems most\nlikely therefore that the story may have originated in some knowledge of the\npower and position of the Greek-Bactrian princes, or their Scythian\nsuccessors, although in the latter compilations it has been mixed up with\nallusions to the first Mohammedan aggressions. See As. Res. V. 506 and XV.\n100.\n\n[566:3](vp140.htm#fr_1527) According to the Mahabharata, he only enlarged and\nfortified the ancient city of Ku\xc5\x9basthali, founded by Raivata. Sabha P.: see\nalso [p. 356](vp093.htm#page_356) of our text.\n\n[567:4](vp140.htm#fr_1528) The name of Muchukunda, as one of the sons of\nMan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81hatri, occurs [p. 363](vp094.htm#page_363); but no further notice is\ntaken of him. The Bhagavata specifies his being the son of that king, and\nrelates the same story of his long sleep as the text. The same occurs in the\nHari Van\xc5\x9ba. The general character of the legends in this chapter is that of\nreference to something familiar, rather than its narration. In the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba\nthe opposite extreme is observable, and there the legends are as prolix as\nhere they are concise. The Bhagavata follows a middle course; but it seems\nunlikely that in either of the three we have the original fables.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXVI](vp141.htm)\n\n'
