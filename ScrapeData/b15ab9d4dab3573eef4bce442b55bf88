This old\nwoman was very poor, and her hut was but a tumble-down place, through the roof\nof which the rain came drip, drip, drip, on more sides than one. This troubled\nher much, and she went running about from side to side, dragging first one\nthing and then another out of the way of the leaky places in the roof, and as\nshe did so, she kept saying to herself, \'Oh dear! oh dear I how tiresome this\nis! I \'m sure the roof will come down! If an elephant, or a lion, or a tiger\nwere to walk in, he wouldn\'t frighten me half as much as this perpetual\ndripping.\' And then she would begin dragging the bed and all the other things\nin the room about again, to get them out of the way of the rain. The Tiger,\nwho was crouching down just outside, heard all that she said, and thought to\nhimself, \'This old woman says she would not be afraid of an elephant, or a\nlion, or a tiger, but that this perpetual dripping frightens her more than\nall. What can this "perpetual dripping" be? it must be something very\ndreadful.\' And, hearing her immediately afterwards dragging all the things\nabout the room again, he said to himself, \'What a terrible noise! Surely that\nmust be the _"perpetual dripping_."\n\nAt this moment a Chattee-maker,  1 who was in search of his donkey which had\nstrayed away, came down the road. The night being very cold, he had, truth to\nsay, taken a little more toddy  2than was good for him, and seeing, by the\nlight of a flash of lightning, a large animal lying down close to the old\nwoman\'s hut, mistook it for the donkey he was looking for. So, running up to\nthe Tiger, he seized hold of it by one ear, and commenced beating, kicking,\nand abusing it with all his might and main.\n\n\'You wretched creature,\' he cried, \'is this the way you serve me, obliging me\nto come out and look for you in such pouring rain, and on such a dark night as\nthis? Get up instantly, or I\'ll break every bone in your body;\' and he went on\nscolding and thumping the Tiger with his utmost power, for he had worked\nhimself up into a terrible rage. The Tiger did not know what to make of it\nall, but he began to feel quite frightened, and said to himself, \'Why, this\nmust be the "perpetual dripping"; no wonder the old woman said she was more\nafraid of it than of an elephant, a lion, or a tiger, for it gives most\ndreadfully hard blows.\'\n\nThe Chattee-maker, having made the Tiger get up, got on his back, and forced\nhim to carry him home, kicking and beating him the whole way (for all this\ntime he fancied he was on his donkey), and then he tied his fore feet and his\nhead firmly together, and fastened him to a post in front of his house, and\nwhen he had done this he went to bed.\n\nNext morning, when the Chattee-maker\'s wife got up and looked out of the\nwindow, what did she see but a great big Tiger tied up in front of their\nhouse, to the post to which they usually fastened the donkey; she was very\nmuch surprised, and running to her husband, awoke him, saying, \'Do you know\nwhat animal you fetched home last night? \'--\' Yes, the donkey, to be sure,\' he\nanswered. \'Come and see,\' said she, and she showed him the great Tiger tied to\nthe post. The Chattee-maker at this was no less astonished than his wife, and\nfelt himself all over to find out if the Tiger had not wounded him. But no\nthere he was, safe and sound, and there was the Tiger tied to the post, just\nas he had fastened it up the night before.\n\nNews of the Chattee-maker\'s exploit soon spread through the village, and all\nthe people came to see him and hear him tell how he had caught the Tiger and\ntied it to the post; and this they thought so wonderful, that they sent a\ndeputation to the Rajah, with a letter to tell him how a man of their village\nhad, alone and unarmed, caught a great Tiger, and tied it to a post.\n\nWhen the Rajah read the letter he also was much surprised, and determined to\ngo in person and see this astonishing sight. So he sent for his horses and\ncarriages, his lords and attendants, and they all set off together to look at\nthe Chattee-maker and the Tiger he had caught.\n\nNow the Tiger was a very large one, and had long been the terror of all the\ncountry round, which made the whole matter still more extraordinary; and this\nbeing represented to the Rajah, he determined to confer every possible honour\non the valiant Chattee-maker. So he gave him houses and lands, and as much\nmoney as would fill a well, made him lord of his court, and conferred on him\nthe command of ten thousand horse.\n\nIt came to pass, shortly after this, that a neighbouring Rajab, who had long\nhad a quarrel with this one, sent to announce his intention of going instantly\nto war with him; and tidings were at the same time brought that the Rajah who\nsent the challenge had gathered a great army together on the borders, and was\nprepared at a moment\'s notice to invade the country.\n\nIn this dilemma no one knew what to do. The Rajah sent for all his generals,\nand inquired which of them would be willing to take command of his forces and\noppose the enemy. They all replied that the country was so ill-prepared for\nthe emergency, and the case was apparently so hopeless, that they would rather\nnot take the responsibility of the chief command. The Rajah knew not whom to\nappoint in their stead. Then some of his people said to him, \'You have lately\ngiven command of ten thousand horse to the valiant Chattee-maker who caught\nthe Tiger, why not make him Commander-in-Chief? A man who could catch a Tiger\nand tie him to a post must surely be more courageous and clever than most.\'--\'\nVery well,\' said the Rajah, \'I will make him Commander-in-Chief.\' So he sent\nfor the Chattee-maker and said to him, \'In your hands I place all the power of\nthe kingdom; you must put our enemies to flight.\'--\' So be it,\' answered the\nChattee-maker, \'but, before I lead the whole army against the enemy, suffer me\nto go by myself and examine their position; and, if possible, find out their\nnumbers and strength.\'\n\nThe Rajah consented, and the Chattee-maker returned home to his wife, and\nsaid, \'They have made me Commander-in-Chief which is a very difficult post for\nme to fill, because I shall have to ride at the head of all the army, and you\nknow I never was on a horse in my life. But I have succeeded in gaining a\nlittle delay, as the Rajah has given me permission to go first alone, and\nreconnoitre the enemy\'s camp. Do you, therefore, provide a very quiet pony,\nfor you know I cannot ride, and I will start to-morrow morning.\'\n\nBut before the Chattee-maker had started, the Rajah sent over to him a most\nmagnificent charger, richly caparisoned, which he begged he would ride when\ngoing to see the enemy\'s camp. The Chattee-maker was frightened almost out of\nhis life, for the charger that the Rajah had sent him was very powerful and\nspirited, and he felt sure that, even if he ever got on it, he should very\nsoon tumble off; however, he did not dare to refuse it, for fear of offending\nthe Rajah by not accepting his present. So he sent him back a message of\ndutiful thanks, and said to his wife, \'I cannot go on the pony now that the\nRajah has sent me this fine horse, but how am I ever to ride it? \'--\' Oh,\ndon\'t be frightened,\' she answered, \'you \'ye only got to get upon it, and I\nwill tie you firmly on, so that you cannot tumble off, and if you start at\nnight no one will see that you are tied on.\'--\' Very well,\' he said. So that\nnight his wife brought the horse that the Rajah had sent him to the door.\n\'Indeed,\' said the Chattee-maker, \'I can never get into that saddle, it is so\nhigh up.\'--\' You must jump,\' said his wife. Then he tried to jump several\ntimes, but each time he jumped he tumbled down again. \'I always forget when I\nam jumping,\' said he, \'which way I ought to turn.\'--\' Your face must be\ntowards the horse\'s head,\' she answered. \'To be sure, of course,\' he cried,\nand giving one great jump he jumped into the saddle, but with his face towards\nthe horse\'s tail. \'This won\'t do at all,\' said his wife as she helped him down\nagain; \'try getting on without jumping.\'--\'I never can remember,\' he\ncontinued, \'when I have got my left foot in the stirrup, what to do with my\nright foot, or where to put it.\'--\' That must go in the other stirrup,\' she\nanswered; \'let me help you.\' So, after many trials, in which he tumbled down\nvery often, for the horse was fresh and did not like standing still, the\nChattee-maker got into the saddle; but no sooner had he got there than he\ncried, \'O wife, wife! tie me very firmly as quickly as possible, for I know I\nshall jump down if I can.\' Then she fetched some strong rope and tied his feet\nfirmly into the stirrups, and fastened one stirrup to the other, and put\nanother rope round his waist, and another round his neck, and fastened them to\nthe horse\'s body, and neck, and tail.\n\nWhen the horse felt all these ropes about him he could not imagine what queer\ncreature had got upon his back, and he began rearing, and kicking, and\nprancing, and at last set off full gallop, as fast as he could tear, right\nacross country. \'Wife, wife,\' cried the Chattee-maker, \'you forgot to tie my\nhands.\'--\'Never mind,\' said she; \'hold on by the mane.\' So he caught hold of\nthe horse\'s mane as firmly as he could. Then away went horse, away went\nChattee-maker, away, away, away, over hedges, over ditches, over rivers, over\nplains, away, away, like a flash of lightning, now this way, now that, on, on,\non, gallop, gallop, gallop, until they came in sight of the enemy\'s camp.\n\nThe Chattee-maker did not like his ride at all, and when he saw where it was\nleading him he liked it still less, for he thought the enemy would catch him\nand very likely kill him. So he determined to make one desperate effort to be\nfree, and stretching out his hand as the horse shot past a young banyan-tree,\nseized hold of it with all his might, hoping the resistance it offered might\ncause the ropes that tied him to break. But the horse was going at his utmost\nspeed, and the soil in which the banyan-tree grew was loose, so that when the\nChattee-maker caught hold of it and gave it such a violent pull, it came up by\nthe roots, and on he rode as fast as before, with the tree in his hand.\n\nAll the soldiers in the camp saw him coming, and having heard that an army was\nto be sent against them, made sure that the Chattee-maker was one of the\nvanguard. \'See,\' cried they, \'here comes a man of gigantic stature on a mighty\nhorse! He rides at full speed across the country, tearing up the very trees in\nhis rage! He is one of the opposing force; the whole army must be close at\nhand. If they are such as he, we are all dead men.\' Then, running to their\nRajah, some of them cried again, \'Here comes the whole force of the enemy\'\n(for the story had by this time become exaggerated); \'they are men of gigantic\nstature, mounted on mighty horses; as they come they tear up the very trees in\ntheir rage; we can oppose men, but not monsters such as these.\' These were\nfollowed by others, who said, \'It is all true,\' for by this time the Chattee-\nmaker had got pretty near the camp, \'they \'re coming! they \'re coming! let us\nfly! let us fly! fly, fly for your lives!\' And the whole panic stricken\nmultitude fled from the camp (those who had seen no cause for alarm going\nbecause the others did, or because they did not care to stay by themselves)\nafter having obliged their Rajah to write a letter to the one whose country he\nwas about to invade, to say that he would not do so, and propose terms of\npeace, and to sign it, and seal it with his seal. Scarcely had all the people\nfled from the camp, when the horse on which the Chattee-maker was came\ngalloping into it, and on his back rode the Chattee-maker, almost dead from\nfatigue, with the banyan-tree in his hand. Just as he reached the camp the\nropes by which he was tied broke, and he fell to the ground. The horse stood\nstill, too tired with its long run to go further. On recovering his senses,\nthe Chattee-maker discovered, to his surprise, that the whole camp, full of\nrich arms, clothes, and trappings, was entirely deserted. In the principal\ntent, moreover, he found a letter addressed to his Rajah, announcing the\nretreat of the invading army, and proposing terms of peace.\n\nSo he took the letter, and returned home with it as fast as he could, leading\nhis horse all the way, for he was afraid to mount him again. It did not take\nhim long to reach his house by the direct road, for whilst riding he had gone\na more circuitous journey than was necessary, and he got there just at\nnightfall. His wife ran out to meet him, overjoyed at his speedy return. As\nsoon as he saw her, he said, \'Ah, wife, since I saw you last I\'ve been all\nround the world, and had many wonderful and terrible adventures. But never\nmind that now, send this letter quickly to the Rajah by a messenger, and also\nthe horse that he sent for me to ride. He will then see, by the horse looking\nso tired, what a long ride I \'ye had, and if he is sent on beforehand, I shall\nnot be obliged to ride him up to the palace-door to-morrow morning, as I\notherwise should, and that would be very tiresome, for most likely I should\ntumble off.\' So his wife sent the horse and the letter to the Rajah, and a\nmessage that her husband would be at the palace early next morning, as it was\nthen late at night And next day he went down there as he had said he would,\nand when the people saw him coming, they said, \'This man is as modest as he is\nbrave; after having put our enemies to flight, he walks quite simply to the\ndoor, instead of riding here in state; as any other man would.\'\n\n![](img/35.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd20.htm#fr_65) Potter.\n\n[2](odd20.htm#fr_66) An intoxicating drink made of palm juice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XVII.
