Vyasa said :--- O King! The Suras that wanted to create hindrance in V\n_r_ itra's tapasya, seeing him firmly resolved, became disappointed in the\nfulfilment of their objects and returned to their own abodes. Thus full one\nhundred years passed away. The four-faced Brahma, the Grandsire of the Lokas,\ncame there mounted on his carrier the Swan, and said :-- \xc2\x93O V _r_ itra! Be\nhappy; now quit your meditation and ask boon; I will grant you the boon that\nyou choose. O Child! Your body has become very lean and thin through your\npenance. I am now very pleased to see your this very hard tapasya. Welfare be\nto you. Now ask the boon that you desire.\xc2\x94 Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus\nthe clearly distinct nectar-like sweet words of the Creator Brahma, V _r_ itra\nshed tears of joy and suddenly stood up. And going to him, bowed down gladly\nbefore His feet, and, with folded hands, spoke to Him, Who is desirous to\ngrant him boons, in a tremulous voice. O Lord! Today I have been fortunate to\nsee Thee who art generally seen with great difficulty; and I have acquired\nthus the posts of all the Devas; O Lotus-seated One! I have got an insatiable\ndesire burning within me. Thou art omniscient, Thou knowest everything; still\nI am speaking out my mind. O Lord! Grant that my death does not occur with\niron, wood, dry or wet substances or with bamboos or any other weapons and let\nmy strength and valour be increased very much in the battle; for, then, I will\nbe unconquerable by all the Devas with all\n\n\n\np. 492\n\n\n\ntheir armies. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus prayed for, Brahma said to him\nsmiling :-- \xc2\x93O Child! get up; I grant that your desired boon will always be\nfulfilled; now go to your own place. Your death won't occur with dry or wet\nsubstances or with stones or wood. I say this truly unto you.\xc2\x94 Thus granting\nthe boon, Brahma went to His Brahmaloka. V _r_ itra, too, became very glad on\nreceiving his desired object, and returned to his own abode. The highly\nintelligent V _r_ itra informed the father about the boon granted to him;\nVis'vakarma became very glad to hear it. O highly fortunate One! Let all bliss\nand good fortune come unto you; kill Indra, my greatest enemy. Go and kill the\nmurderer of my son Tris'ira, the vicious Indra and return to me. Be victorious\nin the battle and become the Lord of all the Devas and remove my mental agony\ndue to the killing of my son. A son becomes then really a son when he obeys\nthe commands of his father and when he feeds plentifully good many people on\nthe Sraddha day (after his father's death) and when he offers Pi _nd_ a at\nGaya. Therefore, O Son! Keep my words and try to remove my sorrows. Know this\nas certain that Tris'ira never vanishes from my mind. Tris'ira was very\ntruthful, amiable and good-natured; he was an ascetic and foremost amongst the\nVedic scholars. The wicked Indra killed my dear son without any offence.\n\n\n\n18-33. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing the father's words, that extremely\nindomitable V _r_ itrasura mounted on his chariot and quickly got out of his\nfather's house. The proud Asura, then, marched to the battle, accompanied with\nhis vast army, to the sounding of the conch-shells and war drums. V _r_ itra,\nversed in politics and morals, exhorted his soldiers before marching and said\n:-- \xc2\x93To-day we will kill Indra and possess the kingdom of the Immortals, freed\nof all enemies.\xc2\x94 O King! Thus, accompanied by his soldiers, and raising a\ntremendous war-cry terrifying to the Devas, the Asura set out for battle. O\nBharata! The King of the Devas, knowing that the Asura is quite at hand,\nbecame overwhelmed with terror and ordered at once the soldiers to be ready\nfor the battle and called quickly all the Lokapalas and sent them all for the\nbattle. The highly lustrous Indra, the tormentor of the foes, arrayed his\ntroops in order according to Gridhra Vyuha (the method in which the vultures\narrange themselves while flying) and stayed there. On the other hand V _r_\nitra, the slayer of enemies, dashed unto that place with all swiftness. A\ndreadful fight then ensued between the Devas and Danavas; the two parties,\ndesirous to get victory over the other, fought awfully hard. When the blaze of\nthe battle fire shone to a very high pitch, the Devas dropped with sorrow\nwhile the Asuras became\n\n\n\np. 493\n\n\n\nexcited with joy. The Devas and Danavas struck each other with Tomaras,\nBhindipalas, axes, Paras'us, Pattis'as, and various other weapons. When the\ndreadful battle rose to a high pitch causing horripilation, V _r_ itra became\nvery angry and suddenly caught hold of Indra and denuding him of all clothes\nand armours swallowed him; he, then, remembering his former enmity, became\nvery glad and stayed there. When Indra was thus devoured by V _r_ itra, the\nDevas were overwhelmed with terror and cried out frequently, with great\ndistress :-- \xc2\x93O Indra! O Indra!\xc2\x94 All the Devas became very dejected and\ngrieved in their hearts to see Indra denuded of his armour and clothes in the\nbelly of V _r_ itra and bowed down to B _r_ ihaspati and said :-- \xc2\x93O Indra of\nthe Brahmans! You are our best Guru what are we to do now? Though the gods\ntried their best to save Indra still V _r_ itra has devoured him. We are all\npowerless, what can we do without Indra? O Lord! Perform quickly magic spells\n(Abhichara process) which will lead to our Indra's liberation.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n34\\. B _r_ ihaspati said :-- \xc2\x93O Suras! The king of the gods is swallowed by V\n_r_ itra, he has been quite disabled; but Indra is living in his bowels;\nattempt therefore must be made that he comes out while living.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n35-54. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Devas became very anxious to see Indra in\nthat plight and took all the ways and means carefully how he might be freed.\nThen they created a state tending to cause yawning, very powerful and\nirresistible and calculated to destroy one's enemy. V _r_ itrasura then yawned\nand his mouth got widely opened and extended. In the meanwhile Indra, the\ndestroyer of one's enemies' strength, contracted all his limbs and came out of\nthe expanded mouth of the Asura and fell down. Since that time, this state of\nyawning has become prevalent amongst the beings. The Devas were all glad to\nsee Indra thus come out. When Indra thus got out, he fought again with V _r_\nitra for 10,000 years (Ajuta years). The fight was very dreadful, causing\nhorripilation. On one side all the Devas joined in the battle; on the other\nside, the pre-eminently powerful V _r_ itra, the son of Vis'vakarma fought.\nWhen V _r_ itrasura got more and more energy in the battle, Indra became\ngradually dwindled and was at last defeated. Indra became very much grieved\nwhen he found himself defeated; the Devas also were very dejected to see this.\nIndra and the other Devas quitted the battle-field and fled away. V _r_\nitrasura too, quickly arrived and occupied the Heavens. V _r_ itra began to\nenjoy by force the Heavenly gardens and took the Airavata elephant. O King!\nThe Asura, the son of Tvasta, took away all Vimanas (the self-moving chariots\nof gods), Uchchais'rava, the best of horses, the heavenly cow, the giver of\ndesires, the Parijata tree, the Apsaras, and all other jewels of the Heavens.\nThe Devas, on the other hand, deprived of their shares in sacrifices\n\n\n\np. 494\n\n\n\nand driven away from their Heavens, suffered very much. V _r_ itrasura became\npuffed up with vanity, when he got possession of the Heavens. Vis'vakarma,\ntoo, became very happy at that time and began to enjoy pleasures along with\nhis son. O Bharata! The Devas, then, united with the Munis and they began to\nconsult about their own welfare. When the Devas took Indra with them and went\nto Maha Deva in the Mount Kailas'a and bowed down to His feet very humbly and,\nwith folded hands, spoke thus :-- O Deva of the Devas! O Maha Deva! Thou art\nthe Mahes'vara and the unbounded Ocean of Mercy! We are defeated by V _r_\nitrasura and we are very much terrified. Save us, O S'ambhu! Thou dost good to\nall the beings; dost thou tell us, therefore, truly what are we to do now,\nwhen that powerful Danava has dispossessed us of our Heavens. O Mahes'a! Now\ndislodged, where are we to go? We are not finding any remedy by which our\nmiseries can be destroyed. O Bhuta Bhavana! We are very much pained; help us;\nO merciful One! That V _r_ itrasura has become intoxicated with vanity due to\nhis being granted the boon. Therefore destroy him.\n\n\n\n55-57. S'ankara said :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! We will keep Brahma in the front and let\nall of us go to the residence of Hari and there consult with Him how to\ndestroy this unruly V _r_ itra. The Janardana Vasudeva is fully capable to do\nall actions. He is powerful, knower of pretexts, highly intelligent, ocean of\nmercy, and fit to be asked by all for protection. Without Him, the Deva of the\nDevas, no success is possible in any action. Therefore all of us ought to go\nthere for the success in our undertaking.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n58-62. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus settling their plan of action, Indra and\nother Devas took S'ankara and Brahma with them and went to the abode of Hari,\nwho protects all and is gracious to His devotees. They, then, began to chant\nPuru _s_ asukta hymns to Him and thus they praised the God Hari, the Guru of\nthis Universe. The Janardan Hari, the Lord of Kamala, then, appeared before\nthem and, after showing his respect, addressed them thus :-- O Lord of the\nseveral Lokas! What have brought you all together with Brahma and S'ankara\nhither? O best of Suras! Please tell me the reason of your coming here. Vyasa\nsaid :-- O King! Thus hearing Hari's words, the Devas could not reply\nanything; rather almost all of them remained with an anxious look with their\nhands folded, overwhelmed with cares.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the defeat of the Devas by V\n_r_ itra in the Maha Pura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk06ch05.htm)\n\n"
