Sattwan, Rajas, Tamas? Say!  \nKrishna. Threefold the faith is of mankind, and springs  \nFrom those three qualities,- becoming "true,"  \nOr "passion-stained," or "dark," as thou shalt hear!\n\nThe faith of each believer, Indian Prince!  \nConforms itself to what he truly is.  \nWhere thou shalt see a worshipper, that one  \nTo what he worships lives assimilate,  \n[Such as the shrine, so is the votary,]  \nThe "soothfast" souls adore true gods; the souls  \nObeying Rajas worship Rakshasas  \nOr Yakshas; and the men of Darkness pray  \nTo Pretas and to Bhutas. Yea, and those  \nWho practise bitter penance, not enjoined  \nBy rightful rule- penance which hath its root  \nIn self-sufficient, proud hypocrisies-  \nThose men, passion-beset, violent, wild,  \nTorturing- the witless ones- My elements  \nShut in fair company within their flesh,  \n(Nay, Me myself, present within the flesh!)  \nKnow them to devils devoted, not to Heaven!  \nFor like as foods are threefold for mankind  \nIn nourishing, so is there threefold way  \nOf worship, abstinence, and almsgiving!  \nHear this of Me! there is a food which brings  \nForce, substance, strength, and health, and joy to live,  \nBeing well-seasoned, cordial, comforting,  \nThe "Soothfast" meat. And there be foods which bring  \nAches and unrests, and burning blood, and grief  \nBeing too biting, heating, salt, and sharp,  \nAnd therefore craved by too strong appetite.  \nAnd there is foul food- kept from over-night,  \nSavourless, filthy, which the foul will eat,  \nA feast of rottenness, meet for the lips  \nOf such as love the "Darkness."\n\nThus with rites;-  \nA sacrifice not for rewardment made,  \nOffered in rightful wise, when he who vows  \nSayeth, with heart devout, "This I should do!  \nIs "Soothfast" rite. But sacrifice for gain,  \nOffered for good repute, be sure that this,  \nO Best of Bharatas! is Rajas-rite,  \nWith stamp of "passion." And a sacrifice  \nOffered against the laws, with no due dole  \nOf food-giving, with no accompaniment  \nOf hallowed hymn, nor largesse to the priests,  \nIn faithless celebration, call it vile,  \nThe deed of "Darkness!"- lost!  \nWorship of gods  \nMeriting worship; lowly reverence  \nOf Twice-borns, Teachers, Elders; Purity,  \nRectitude, and the Brahmacharya\'s vow,  \nAnd not to injure any helpless thing,-  \nThese make a true religiousness of Act.\n\nWords causing no man woe, words ever true,  \nGentle and pleasing words, and those ye say  \nIn murmured reading of a Sacred Writ,-  \nThese make the true religiousness of Speech.\n\nSerenity of soul, benignity,  \nSway of the silent Spirit, constant stress  \nTo sanctify the Nature,- these things make  \nGood rite, and true religiousness of Mind.\n\nSuch threefold faith, in highest piety  \nKept, with no hope of gain, by hearts devote  \nIs perfect work of Sattwan, true belief.\n\nReligion shown in act of proud display  \nTo win good entertainment, worship, fame,  \nSuch- say I- is of Rajas, rash and vain.\n\nReligion followed by a witless will  \nTo torture self, or come at power to hurt  \nAnother,- \'tis of Tamas, dark and ill.\n\nThe gift lovingly given, when one shall say  \n"Now must I gladly give!" when he who takes  \nCan render nothing back; made in due place,  \nDue time, and to a meet recipient,  \nIs gift of Sattwan, fair and profitable.\n\nThe gift selfishly given, where to receive  \nIs hoped again, or when some end is sought,  \nOr where the gift is proffered with a grudge,  \nThis is of Rajas, stained with impulse, ill.\n\nThe gift churlishly flung, at evil time,  \nIn wrongful place, to base recipient,  \nMade in disdain or harsh unkindliness,  \nIs gift of Tamas, dark; it doth not bless!\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER XVII OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Sraddhatrayavibhagayog,"  \nOr "The Book of Religion by the Threefold  \nKinds of Faith."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 18: Of Religion by Deliverance and Renunciation](bg18.htm)\n\n'
