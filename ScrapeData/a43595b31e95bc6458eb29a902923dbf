I think of that Agni who is a Vasu, to whom the milch-cows go home, the\nswift horses (go) home, (our) own racers (go) home. Bring food to thy\npraisers!\n\n2\\. He is Agni who is praised as the Vasu, he to whom the milch-cows come\ntogether, and the quickly running horses, and the well-born liberal patrons.\nBring food to thy praisers!\n\n3\\. For Agni, dwelling among all tribes, gives a racer to the clan. Agni\n(gives a racer) that is truly helpful for (winning) wealth\n[1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:3:1): he (the racer) being well cherished, will attain\nprecious gain. Bring food to thy praisers!\n\n4\\. May we kindle thee [1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:4:1), Agni, O god, the\nbrilliant, never ageing, in order that yon highly miraculous fuel of thine\n[2](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:4:2) may shine in the sky. Bring food to thy praisers!\n\n5\\. To thee [1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:5:1), O Agni, our oblation is offered with\na _Ri_ _k_ , O lord of bright splendour, highly brilliant, wonderful lord of\nthe clan, carrier of oblations! Bring food to thy praisers!\n\n6\\. Those Agnis make everything precious prosper in the Agnis; they drive\nforward (precious wealth); they incite it; they speed it hither in the due way\n[1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:6:1). Bring food to thy praisers!\n\n7\\. Those flames of thine, O Agni, the racers, have boasted mightily--they who\nwith the flight of their\n\np. 380\n\nhoofs have made tremble [1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:7:1) the stables of the cows.\nBring food to thy praisers!\n\n8\\. Bring fresh food with fine dwellings, O Agni, to us, thy praisers! May we\nbe of those who have praised (thee), who have thee as their messenger, house\nby house. Bring food to thy praisers!\n\n9\\. Thou warmest in thy mouth, O highly brilliant one, the two (sacrificial)\nladles full of butter. And mayst thou fill us (with gifts) at our hymns, O\nlord of strength! Bring food to thy praisers!\n\n10\\. Thus [1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:10:1) they have driven, they have led\n[2](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:10:2), Agni in the due way by prayers and sacrifices.\nMay he bestow on us plenty of valiant men, and that plenty of swift horses\n(wished for) [3](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:10:3). Bring food to thy praisers!\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti.--Verse 1 = SV. I, 425. Verses 1-2 =\nVS. XV, 41, 42; MS. II, 13, 7. Verses 1, 3, 2 = SV. II, 1087-1089\\. Verse 3 =\nTB. III, 11, 6, 4. Verse 4 = SV. I, 419; AV. XVIII, 4, 88; MS. II, 13, 7.\nVerses 4, 5, 9 = SV. II, 372-374; TS. IV, 4, 4, 6. Verse 9 = VS. XV, 43; TS.\nII, 2, 12, 7.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. At first sight the conjecture of Bohtlingk-Roth and Grassmann, rayim,\nis very tempting, cf. IX, 12, 9. rayim \xe2\x80\xa6 su-abhuvam; X, 122, 3. rayi _n_ a \xe2\x80\xa6\nsu-abuva. I believe, nevertheless, that on closer examination the traditional\ntext will prove correct. Sa prita _h_ evidently refers to the racer (va _g_\nin) cf. I, 66, 4 = 69, 5. va _g_ i\xc2\xb4 na prita _h_ (cf. also X, 101, 7. pri _n_\nita a _s_ van): then it follows that su-abhuvam also refers to the racer, and\nraye (cf. I, 100, 16; III, 53, 16) will be quite right.\n\np. 381\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Te stands for the accusative; see Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen\nMorgenland. Gesellschaft, XXXV, 715; Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, p. 205.\n\nNote 2. This refers to the sun. By kindling the sacred fire men make the sun\nrise. See H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 110.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The pronoun 'to thee' stands twice, to in the first Pada (where it is\nrepeated from the first Pada of verse 4, a\xc2\xb4 te agne), and tubhyam (or rather\ntubhya) in the fourth Pada, unless we construe to havi _h_.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 127.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. See Gaedicke, Der Accusativ, p. 57.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. On the nasalization of eva\xc2\xb4n\xcc\x90, cf. H. O., Prolegomena, p. 469 seq.\n\nNote 2. Pischel (Vedische Studien, II, 127) explains a _g_ u _h_ as a _g_ ush,\nthe contrary of sa _g_ u\xc2\xb4sh. Bartholomae (Studien zur Indogermanischen\nSprachgeschichte, II, 159, note 2; cf. Indogermanische Forschungen, III, 108,\nnote I) conjectures a _g_ ur (= a _g_ man) yamu _h_ : 'sie haben ihn jetzt auf\nseiner Bahn festgehalten.' I believe, as Saya _n_ a does, that this a _g_\nuryamu _h_ contains two independent verbs, a _g_ u _h_ and yamu _h_ , which\nare quite correct forms of the roots a _g_ and yam (see Delbruck, Altindisches\nVerbum, p. 65). As to a _g_ , cf. VI, 2, 8. a _g_ yase agne va _g_ i\xc2\xb4 na; V,\n30, 14. atya _h_ na va _g_ i\xc2\xb4 raghu _h_ a _g_ yamana _h_ ; as to yam II, 5, 1.\n_s_ akema va _g_ ina _h_ (i. e. agne _h_ ) yamam. But should not the accent be\nyamu _h_?\n\nNote 3. The fourth Pada is identical with VIII, 6, 24.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 7](sbe46111.htm)\n\n"
