Water (is produced from fire).\n\nWe have to supply from the preceding Sutra the words 'thence' and 'for thus\nthe text declares.'--Water is produced from fire; for the text says, 'it sent\nforth water' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 3), and 'from fire (sprang) water' (Taitt. Up.\nII, 1). These explicit statements allow no room for doubt 2. The Sutrakara,\nhowever, having explained the creation of fire, and being about to explain the\ncreation of\n\np. 23\n\nearth, propounds this Sutra in order to insert water (and thus to point out\nits position in the s _ri_ sh _t_ ikrama).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[22:2](sbe38012.htm#fr_20) So that the Sutra might possibly be looked upon as\nno called for.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 12](sbe38013.htm)\n\n"
