There was (once) a royal sage,\nnamed Alarka, whose penance was very great, who understood duty, who was\nveracious, high-souled, and very firm in his vows. Having with his bow\nconquered this world as far as the ocean,--having performed very difficult\ndeeds 2,--he turned his mind to subtle 3 (subjects). While he was sitting at\nthe foot of a tree, O you of great intelligence! his thoughts, abandoning\n(those) great deeds, turned to subtle (questions).\n\nAlarka said:\n\nMy mind is become (too) strong 4; that conquest is constant in which the mind\nis conquered. (Though) surrounded by enemies, I shall direct my arrows\nelsewhere 5. As by its unsteadiness, it wishes 6, to\n\np. 297\n\nmake all mortals perform action, I will cast very sharp-edged arrows at the\nmind.\n\nThe mind said:\n\nThese arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will, only\npierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you will die.\nLook out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.\n\nHearing that, he then spoke these words after consideration:--\n\nAlarka said:\n\nSmelling very many perfumes, one hankers after them only. Therefore I will\ncast sharp arrows at the nose.\n\nThe nose 1 said.\n\nThese arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will only\npierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you will die.\nLook out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.\n\nHearing that, he then spoke these words after consideration:--\n\nAlarka said:\n\nEnjoying savory tastes, this (tongue) hankers after\n\np. 298\n\nthem only. Therefore I will cast sharp arrows at the tongue.\n\nThe tongue said:\n\nThese arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will only\npierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you will die.\nLook out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.\n\nHearing that, he then spoke these words after consideration:--\n\nAlarka said:\n\nTouching various (objects of) touch, the skin hankers after them only.\nTherefore I will tear off the skin by various feathered arrows.\n\nThe skin said:\n\nThese arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will only\npierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you will die.\nLook out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.\n\nHearing that, he then said after consideration:--\n\nAlarka said:\n\nHearing various sounds, the (ear) hankers after them only. Therefore I (will)\ncast sharp arrows at the ear.\n\nThe ear said:\n\nThese arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will only\npierce your own vital part, and then you will lose (your) life. Look out for\nother arrows by which you may destroy me.\n\nHearing that, he then said after consideration:--\n\np. 299\n\nAlarka said:\n\nSeeing numerous colours, the eye hankers after them only. Therefore I will\ndestroy the eye with sharp arrows.\n\nThe eye said:\n\nThese arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will only\npierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you will die.\nLook out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.\n\nHearing that, he then said after consideration:--\n\nAlarka said:\n\nThis (understanding) forms various determinations by its operation. Therefore\nI will cast sharp arrows at the understanding.\n\nThe understanding said:\n\nThese arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will only\npierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you will die.\nLook out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a 1 said:\n\nThen Alarka even there employed himself in a fearful penance 2 difficult to\nperform; but he did not obtain any arrows for these seven by his devotions.\nThen that king deliberated with a mind very intent on one (subject), and after\ndeliberating for a long time, O best of the twice-born! Alarka, the best of\ntalented (men), could not arrive at anything better\n\np. 300\n\nthan concentration of mind [1](sbe0843.htm#fn_1437). Then directing his mind\nto one point [2](sbe0843.htm#fn_1438), he became steady, and applied himself\nto concentration of mind. And (then) the brave man forthwith destroyed the\nsenses with one arrow; and entering the self by means of concentration of\nmind, he reached the highest perfection. And the royal sage, amazed, then\nuttered this verse, 'O! Alas! that we should have engaged in all external\n(matters); that being possessed of a desire for enjoyments, we should have\ndevoted ourselves before now to sovereignty! I have now subsequently learnt\nthat there is no higher happiness than concentration of mind.' Do you\nunderstand this too, O Rama! and do not kill Kshatriyas. Perform a fearful\n[3](sbe0843.htm#fn_1439) penance, thence you will obtain the highest good.\nThus spoken to by (his) grandfathers, the noble son of Gamadagni engaged\nhimself in fearful penance, and attained that perfection which is difficult to\nreach.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[296:1](sbe0842.htm#fr_1433) The impropriety or sinfulness of slaughter.\n\n[296:2](sbe0842.htm#fr_1434) Such as the subjugation of enemies and so forth.\n\n[296:3](sbe0842.htm#fr_1435) The Brahman, says Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[296:4](sbe0842.htm#fr_1436) I. e. too strong to be under control.\n\n[296:5](sbe0842.htm#fr_1437) That is to say, elsewhere than towards the\nexternal foes with whom he was waging war.\n\n[296:6](sbe0842.htm#fr_1438) The text is unsatisfactory here. I adopt Nilaka\n_nth_ a's reading.\n\n[297:1](sbe0842.htm#fr_1439) This and the other corresponding words must be\nunderstood to refer not to the physical nose and so forth, but the sense\nseated there. The nose here, for instance, stands for the sense of smell.\nNilaka _nth_ a understands all these words of Alarka as indicating the so-\ncalled Ha _th_ a-yoga, which, he adds, invariably occasions death. As to the\nthrowing of arrows at the mind, he says, it means, 'I will subdue the mind by\nthe restraint of the excretive organs by means of the Ha _th_ a-yoga.' And\nfinally he says, A man, having restrained all the senses by means of the Ha\n_th_ a-yoga, merely droops away; becoming deficient in those senses, he does\nnot accomplish his end.\n\n[299:1](sbe0842.htm#fr_1440) Sic in our copies. It should be the Pit _ri_ s,\nseeing that they are relating Alarka's story to Para _s_ urama.\n\n[299:2](sbe0842.htm#fr_1441) Meditation, or pondering, according to Nilaka\n_nth_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVI](sbe0843.htm)\n\n"
