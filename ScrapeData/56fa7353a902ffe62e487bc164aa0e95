The one (word 'sprang') may be (taken in its secondary as well as in its\nprimary sense), like the word 'Brahman.'\n\nThis Sutra contains the reply to a doubt.--If we admit the opinion maintained\nhitherto, how can one and the same word 'sprang' ('from that Self sprang the\nether') be used, in the same chapter, in its primary (real) meaning with\nregard to fire and so on, and in a secondary meaning with regard to ether?--\nThe answer to this objection is that the one word 'sprang' may, according to\nthe nature of the things to which it refers, be used in its primary as well as\nits secondary sense, just as the word 'Brahman' is used. For the one word\n'Brahman' is, in the passage Taitt. Up. III, 2-6 ('Try to know Brahman by\npenance, for penance is Brahman'), used in a secondary sense with regard to\nfood, &c., and in its primary sense with regard to bliss; and the same word\nBrahman is, in the way of figurative identification (bhakti), applied to\npenance, which is merely the means of knowing Brahman, and again directly to\nBrahman as the object of knowledge.--But how--to raise another question--can\nwe, on the supposition of ether having no beginning, uphold the validity of\nthe statement made in the clause 'one only, without a second?' For if ether is\na second entity (co-existing with Brahman from eternity), it follows that\nBrahman has a second. And if so, how can it be said that when Brahman is known\neverything is known? ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 1).--The word 'one,' the purvapakshin\nreplies, may be used with reference to (the absence of) effects. As in\nordinary life a person, who on a certain\n\np. 8\n\nday sees in a potter's house a lump of clay, a staff, a wheel and so on, and\non the following day a number of finished vessels, might say, 'Yesterday there\nwas only clay,' meaning thereby only that on the preceding day there were no\nthings made of clay, not that there were no staff, wheel and the like; so the\npassage under discussion also is to be understood.--The term 'without a\nsecond' (does not exclude the existence from eternity of ether, but) excludes\nthe existence of any other superintending being (but Brahman). While there is\na superintending potter in addition to the material cause of the vessels, i.e.\nthe clay, there is no other superintendent in addition to Brahman, the\nmaterial cause of the world. Nor does the existence of ether as a second\nentity involve Brahman's being associated with a second (and therefore not\nbeing of a simple nature). For diversity is founded on difference of\ncharacteristic attributes, and before the origin (of the creation) no\ndifference of attributes separating Brahman and ether exists; the two being\nmixed like water and milk, and having the common attributes of all-\npervadingness, immateriality and so on. At the time of creation however a\ncertain diversity of the two determines itself, Brahman putting forth energy\nin order to produce the world, while the ether remains immoveable.--And also\nfrom the passages quoted above--such as 'Brahman has the ether for its body'--\nit follows that the two are identical. Thence again it follows that through\nthe knowledge of Brahman everything is known.--Moreover every effect, which is\nproduced, is produced in such a way as not to be separated from ether in place\nas well as in time, and ether itself is non-separated in place and time from\nBrahman; hence, if there are known Brahman and its effects, the ether also is\nknown. The case is similar to that of a few drops of water poured into a jug\nfull of milk. Those drops are taken when the milk is taken; the taking of the\ndrops does not constitute something additional to the taking of the milk.\nAnalogously the ether, as being non-separate in place and time from Brahman\nand its effects, is comprised within Brahman, and consequently we have to\nunderstand the passages\n\np. 9\n\nabout the origin of the ether in a secondary sense.--To this argumentation we\nmake the following reply.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 6](sbe38007.htm)\n\n"
