The only real and eternal element in the\nsevenfold man--for real and eternal are, for \xc5\x9aankara, synonymous terms--is the\nperfect Self, which is one with the Eternal. In manifestation this Self\nappears in three degrees: the intuitional self, the emotional self, the\nphysical self; and, for each of these there is a vesture suited to its nature.\nThus the divine Self, with its three degrees, and their three vestures, make\nup the perfect seven.\n\nThe three lesser degrees of the Self are its representatives in the three\nmanifest worlds: the spiritual world, the middle world, the physical world.\nAnd, very naturally, the middle world partakes in some degree of the nature of\nthe other two; so that its highest layer is touched with the nature of the\nspiritual world, while its lowest layer is touched with the nature of the\nphysical world.\n\nThis threefold nature of the middle world finds its counterpart in the three\nveils which make up the vesture of the middle self, which we have called the\nemotional self as perhaps the best description of its total nature.\n\nThe three veils of the middle self are the vital veil,\n\np. 131\n\nthe sensuous veil, and the intellectual veil; and the regents of the last two\nare 'mind' and 'soul,' as we have translated the original terms--Manas and\nBuddhi.\n\nDevelopment takes place, therefore, by the gradually raising of the self\nthrough these vestures and veils; so that, having begun as the physical self\nin pure animal life, it gradually becomes the emotional and intellectual self\nof human life, then the intuitional self of life that is something more than\nhuman, and at last realizes itself as the eternal Self which is one with the\nEternal.\n\nTo this, the first part of the Catechism, is then added the outline of\n\xc5\x9aankara's idealistic physics, the doctrine of the three potencies of\nsubstance, force, space; or, as one might call it, from a different point of\nview, the three modes of subject, predicate, object: of the knower, the\nknowing, the known. And as perception is of five types, the subject,\npredicate, and object are divided into the five types of sensuous perception.\nBut as the objects of sensuous perception are not simple, but each respond to\nseveral different sensations, a description is found for this fact in the\n'process of five-folding' of the object. As an example, a piece of camphor\nresponds not only to the sense of sight but to other senses, touch, taste,\nsmell; it is therefore conceived as made up of the five natures that are\nobjects of sensuous perception, so mingled that one nature is dominant. The\nthree potencies and the five natures are the three vestures and the five\nveils, from another point of view.\n\nVery important are the definitions: 'mind' is the power of intending and\ndoubting; 'soul' is the power of affirmation; the latter approaching the\nintuitional self\n\np. 132\n\nwhich is the 'enlightened spiritual will.' To express in terms of morals this\npsychological analysis, we may say that at first through the power of self-\nassertion, the idea of selfhood is falsely attributed to the physical body and\nits animal nature, and then to the mental picture of the physical body, which\nis the emotional self or lower personality. The task of regeneration, of\ninitiating true life, consists in first checking this false self-assertion--\nselfishness and sensuality--and then through the stages of 'intending and\ndoubting' and strong 'affirmation' substituting for the lower personality the\nenlightened spiritual will, which is the direct expression of the real Self,\nre-becoming the Eternal.\n\nThen this chapter of physics and psychology is followed by one of metaphysics.\nThere is the real Self, which is the Eternal. But we do not realize our life\nas that real Self. Why do we not realize it? Because of two errors, or\nillusions, which make up the double 'heresy of separateness.' The first error\nis the error of our apartness from the Eternal. The second error is the error\nof our apartness from each other. The removal of these two errors constitutes\n'our duty towards God' and 'our duty towards our neighbor'; in both cases the\nreal gain is our own, is the gain of our real Self.\n\n\xc5\x9aankara calls the first error glamor;, the second, unwisdom. The picture of\nthe self formed through the first is the Lord; the picture of the self formed\nthrough the second is the Life. And the real nature of both is the same--pure\nconsciousness--though there is a verbal difference, a difference of\ndefinition, between them.\n\np. 133\n\nThen, in conclusion, the three forms of 'deeds' or Karma. We may compare\n'accumulated deeds' to capital; 'deeds entered on,' to interest; and 'deeds to\ncome,' to the earnings of an unselfish man for the good of others. And we must\nremember that each of these has a debit as well as a credit side.\n\nThe real value of this little treatise is as a key and outline of longer and\nmore complicated works; yet it has a high excellence of its own.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Essence of the Teaching](cjw19.htm)\n\n"
