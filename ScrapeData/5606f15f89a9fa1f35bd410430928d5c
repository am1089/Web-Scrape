That water (used for working the clay) has been boiled by means of\nresin of the pala _s_ a tree (butea frondosa), just for the sake of firmness.\nAnd as to why (it is done) by pala _s_ a resin;--the pala _s_ a tree doubtless\nis Soma 1, and Soma is the moon, and that (moon) indeed is one of Agni's\n\np. 230\n\nforms: it is for the obtainment of that form of Agni (that pala _s_ a resin is\nused).\n\n6:5:1:22\\. He pours it on (the clay), with (Va _g_. S. XI, 50-52; _Ri_ k S. X,\n9, 1-3), 'Refreshing ye are, O waters 1!' To whatever deity a _Ri_ k-verse,\nand to whatever deity a Ya _g_ us formula applies, that _Ri_ k-verse is that\nvery deity, and that Ya _g_ us formula is that very deity: hence this triplet\n(XI, 50-52) is these waters, and they are those very waters which appeared as\none form 2: that form he now makes it.\n\n6:5:1:33\\. He then produces foam and puts it thereto: the second form which\nwas created (in the shape of) foam 3, that form he thus makes it. And the clay\nhe now mixes is that very clay which was created as the third form. It was\nfrom these forms that he (Agni) was created at the beginning, and from them he\nnow produces him.\n\n6:5:1:44\\. He then mixes it with the goat's hair, just for the sake of\nfirmness. And as to why with goat's hair,--the gods then collected him (Agni)\nfrom out of the cattle, and in like manner does this one now collect him from\nout of the cattle. And as to why with goat's hair, it is because in the he-\ngoat (is contained) the form of all cattle; and as to its being hair, form is\nhair 4.\n\n6:5:1:55\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 53] 'Mitra having mixed the earth and ground with\nlight,'--Mitra doubtless\n\np. 231\n\nis the breath, and the breath first did this sacred work;--'I mix (fashion)\nthee, the well-born knower of beings, for health to creatures,'--as the text,\nso its meaning.\n\n6:5:1:66\\. Then there are these three kinds of powder (dust)--(sand of)\ngravel, stone, and iron-rust--therewith he mixes (the clay), just for\nfirmness. And as to why (it is mixed) therewith, it is because thereof this\n(earth) consisted when it was created in the beginning: thus whatlike this\n(earth) was created in the beginning, such he now makes it (the earth, or\nfire-pan).\n\n6:5:1:77\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 54] 'The Rudras, having mixed the earth, kindled\nthe great light;'--for this Agni is yonder sun: thus it is that great light\nwhich the Rudras, having mixed the earth, did kindle;--'yea, never-failing and\nbrilliant, their light shineth among the gods;'--for that never-failing and\nbrilliant light of theirs does indeed shine among the gods.\n\n6:5:1:88\\. With two (verses) he mixes (the clay),--two-footed is the\nSacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, so great he thus mixes (fashions) him.\n\n6:5:1:99\\. He then kneads it, with(Va _g_. S. XI, 55), 'Mixed by the Vasus,\nthe Rudras,'--for this (clay) has indeed been mixed both by the Vasus and the\nRudras: by the Vasus, because by Mitra and by the Rudras, because by the\nRudras;--'by the wise, the clay suitable for the work;'--for wise those (gods)\nare, and suitable for the (sacred) work is this clay;--'making it soft with\nher hands, may Sinivali fashion it!'--Sinivali doubtless is speech: thus, 'May\nshe, having made it soft with her hands, fashion it!'\n\np. 232\n\n6:5:1:1010\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 56] 'Sinivali, the fair-knotted, fair-braided,\nfair-locked,'--for Sinivali is a woman, and that is indeed the perfect form of\nwoman, to wit, the fair-knotted, fair-braided, fair-locked: he thus makes her\nperfect;--'may she place the fire-pan into thy hands, O great Aditi!'--the\ngreat Aditi doubtless is this earth: it is to this earth that he says this.\n\n6:5:1:1111\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 57] 'Let Aditi fashion the fire-pan, by her\nskill, her arms, her wisdom!'--for by her skill, by her arms, and by her\nwisdom she does indeed fashion it;--'may she bear Agni in her womb, even as a\nmother (bears) her son in her lap!'--that is, 'as a mother would bear her son\nin her lap, so may she (Aditi) bear Agni in her womb!'\n\n6:5:1:1212\\. With three (formulas) he kneads (the clay),--threefold is Agni:\nas great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus kneads\nhim. With two (verses) he mixes,--that makes five;--of five layers consists\nthe fire-altar (Agni); five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great\nas Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. With three\n(formulas) he pours water thereto,--that makes eight;--of eight syllables the\nGayatri metre consists, and Agni is Gayatra: as great as Agni is, as great as\nis his measure, so great does this become. And, moreover, as one of eight\nsyllables 1 this (earth) was created in the beginning: thus as great as this\n(earth) was created in the beginning, so great he thus makes this (fire-pan\nrepresenting the earth).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[229:1](sbe4141.htm#fr_461) See part i, p. 183.\n\n[230:1](sbe4141.htm#fr_462) The whole triplet runs thus: 'Refreshing ye are, O\nwaters; lead us to strength, to see great joy!--whatever is your most benign\nsap, therein let us share, like loving mothers!--For you we will readily go to\nhim, to whose abode ye urge us, O waters, and quicken us.'\n\n[230:2](sbe4141.htm#fr_463) See [VI, 1, 1, 12](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:12).\n\n[230:3](sbe4141.htm#fr_464) [VI, 1, 1, 13](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:13).\n\n[230:4](sbe4141.htm#fr_465) That is, the hair of cattle is the most obvious\ncharacteristic of their outward appearance.\n\n[232:1](sbe4141.htm#fr_466) See [VI, 1, 2,\n6](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:6)-[7](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:7).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 5, 2.
