In the enclosed space (of the cart) 1 he (the Adhvaryu) lays down\nthe black deer-skin, with the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 30), 'Thou art Aditi's\nskin;' its significance is the same (as before) 2. Thereon he places him\n(Soma), with, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!' for Aditi being this (earth), and\nshe being indeed a safe resting-place, he thereby places him on that safe\nresting-place: therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!'\n\n3:3:4:22\\. He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching (the Soma), 'The\nbull hath propped the sky, the welkin 3.' For, when the gods were spreading\nthe sacrifice, they were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas.\nNow by what he says, 'The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin,'\n\np. 76\n\nthereby they rendered it (the sacrifice or Soma) superior to the deadly shaft\n1.\n\n3:3:4:33\\. 'He hath measured the breadth of the earth;'--thus he gains through\nhim (Soma) these worlds, for there is no slayer, no deadly shaft for him by\nwhom these worlds have been gained: therefore he says, 'He hath measured the\nbreadth of the earth.'\n\n3:3:4:44\\. 'As all-ruler hath he taken his seat over all things existing\n(bhuvana);'--thus he gains through him this All, for there is no slayer, no\ndeadly shaft for him by whom this All has been gained: therefore he says, 'As\nall-ruler hath he taken his seat over all things existing.'\n\n3:3:4:55\\. 'Verily, all these are Varu _n_ a's ordinances;'--thereby he makes\nhere everything whatsoever obedient to him, and every one that is refractory:\ntherefore he says, 'Verily, all these are Varu _n_ a's ordinances.'\n\n3:3:4:66\\. Thereupon he wraps (the Soma) up in the Soma-wrapper, lest the evil\nspirits should touch him. For this one doubtless is an embryo, and hidden\n(tiras), as it were, are embryos, and hidden also is that (which is) wrapped\nup;--hidden, as it were, are the gods to men, and hidden is that which is\nwrapped up: therefore he wraps him up.\n\n3:3:4:77\\. He wraps him up, with the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 31; Rig-veda V, 85,\n2), 'Over the woods he hath stretched the welkin,' for over the woods, over\nthe tops of the trees, that welkin (or air) is indeed stretched;--'strength\n(hath he laid) into the coursers, milk into the kine,'--strength means\n\np. 77\n\nmanliness and the coursers are the men: he thereby bestows manliness upon men;\nand 'milk into the kine' he says, because this milk is indeed contained in the\nkine;--'Into the hearts Varu _n_ a (hath laid) wisdom, into the homesteads 1\nfire;' for into the hearts that wisdom, the swiftness of thought, has indeed\nentered; and 'into the homesteads fire' he says, because that fire is in the\nhomesteads, with the people;--'Into the heaven hath he placed the Sun, and\nSoma upon the rock;' for that sun is indeed placed in the heaven; and 'Soma on\nthe rock' he says, because Soma is in the mountains. This is why he says, 'In\nthe heaven hath he placed the Sun, and Soma upon the rock.'\n\n3:3:4:88\\. If there are two deer-skins 2, he then puts up the other by way of\na flag 3;--and if there is only one, he cuts off the neck of the deer-skin and\nputs it up by way of a flag;--with the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 32), 'Mount thou\nthe eye of Surya, the eye-ball of Agni, where thou fliest along with the\ndappled (horses), shining through the wise (Surya).' He thereby places Surya\n(the sun) in front, thinking, 'May Surya, in front, ward off the evil\nspirits!' They now drive (Soma) about on a safe (cart), unmolested by evil\nspirits.\n\n3:3:4:99\\. At the fore-part of the shafts two boards have been put up: between\nthem the Subrahma _n_ ya 4\n\np. 78\n\nstands and drives. He (Soma), indeed, is too high for (the driver) mounting\nbeside him, for who is worthy of mounting beside him? Therefore he drives\nwhile standing between (the boards).\n\n3:3:4:1010\\. He drives with a pala _s_ a branch. Now when Gayatri flew towards\nSoma 1, a footless archer aiming at her while she was carrying him off,\nsevered one of the feathers (or leaves, par _n_ a), either of Gayatri or of\nking Soma; and on falling down it became a par _n_ a (pala _s_ a) tree; whence\nits name par _n_ a. 'May that which was there of the Soma nature, be here also\nnow!' so he thinks, and for this reason he drives with a pala _s_ a branch.\n\n3:3:4:1111\\. He urges on the two oxen. If they be both black, or if either of\nthem be black, then let him know that it will rain, that Par _g_ anya will\nhave abundance of rain that year: such indeed is science.\n\n3:3:4:1212\\. He (the Adhvaryu) first yokes them, with the text (Va _g_. S. IV,\n33), 'Ye oxen, come hither, patient of the yoke!' for they are indeed oxen,\nand they are patient of the yoke;--'Let yourselves be yoked, tearless!' for\nthey are now being yoked; and tearless means unscathed;--'not man-slaying,'\nthis means 'not doing wrong;'--'speeding the Brahman,' for they are indeed\nspeeders of the Brahman (worship, or the priests);--'Go ye happily to the\nsacrificer's dwelling!' this he says in order that the evil spirits may not\ninjure them on the way.\n\n3:3:4:1313\\. Having then gone round to the back (of the\n\np. 79\n\ncart) and taken hold of the drag 1, he says (to the Hot _ri_ ) 2, 'Recite to\nthe bought Soma!' or,'--to Soma, now driven about!' whichever way he pleases.\n\n3:3:4:1414\\. He then makes (the sacrificer 3) say the text (Va _g_. S. IV,\n34), 'Thou art gracious unto me, go forth, O Lord of the world--,' for he\n(Soma) is indeed gracious to him, wherefore he heeds no other but him. Even\nhis (Soma's own) kings 4 come (to\n\np. 80\n\nhim) to attend the assembly, and he is the first to salute the kings, for he\nis gracious. This is why he says, 'Thou art gracious.' 'Go forth, O Lord of\nthe world,' he says, because he (Soma) is the lord of beings. 'To all\ndwellings,' 'all dwellings' doubtless means the limbs; with reference to his\nlimbs he says this, 'May no prowling enemies meet thee! may no waylayers meet\nthee! May no malicious wolves meet thee!' this he says lest the evil spirits\nshould meet him on his way.\n\n3:3:4:1515\\. 'Having become a falcon, fly away!' he thereby makes him fly\nforward after becoming a falcon; for the evil spirits fly not after what is\nfearful: now he, the falcon, forsooth is the most fearful, the strongest of\nbirds, and as such a one he makes him (Soma) fly forwards when he says,\n'Having become a falcon, fly away!'\n\n3:3:4:1616\\. Now they (can) only hit his body 1. 'Go to the sacrificer's\ndwelling,--that is the place prepared for us.' In this there is nothing\nobscure.\n\np. 81\n\n3:3:4:1717\\. Thereupon he recites the Subrahma _n_ ya litany. Even as one\nwould say to those for whom he intends to prepare a meal, 'On such and such a\nday I will prepare a meal for you;' so does he thereby announce the sacrifice\nto the gods. 'Subrahma _n_ yom! Subrahma _n_ yom! Subrahma _n_ yom!' thus he\ncalls, for the Brahman indeed moves the gods onward. Thrice he says it,\nbecause the sacrifice is threefold.\n\n3:3:4:1818\\. 'Come, O Indra!' Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore\nhe says, 'Come, O Indra!' 'Come, O lord of the bay steeds! Ram of Medhatithi\n1! Wife of V _ri_ sha _n_ a _s_ va 2! Bestriding buffalo! Lover of Ahalya 3!'\nThereby he wishes him joy in those affairs of his.\n\np. 82\n\n3:3:4:1919\\. 'O Kau _s_ ika 1, Brahman, thou who callest thee Gautama 2.' Just\nso has this (formula) been devised in these days by \xc3\x82ru _n_ i, to wit, 'thou\nwho callest thee Gautama:' he may say it, if he choose, and if he does not\nchoose, he need not attend to it 3. 'In so and so many days, to the Soma-\nfeast,' (stating) in how many days from hence the pressing is to be.\n\n3:3:4:2020\\. 'Ye gods and priests, come hither 4!' This he says to the gods\nand Brahmans, because it is of these two, the gods and Brahmans, that he has\nneed.\n\n3:3:4:2121\\. Thereupon the Pratiprasthat _ri_ steps up to the front of the\nhall with the victim for Agni and Soma. Now Agni and Soma have seized him, who\nconsecrates himself, between their jaws, for that consecration-offering above\n5 belongs to Agni and Vish _n_ u, and Vish _n_ u, forsooth, is no other than\n\np. 83\n\n[paragraph continues] Soma, and the offering is he himself who is consecrated:\nthus they have seized him between their jaws; and by this victim he now\nredeems himself 1.\n\n3:3:4:2222\\. Now, some take a firebrand from the \xc3\x82havaniya, saying, 'Here is\nAgni, and here is Soma: with these two thus being together we will redeem\nourselves.' But let him not do this; for wheresoever these two are, there they\nare indeed together.\n\n3:3:4:2323\\. It (the victim) is two-coloured, because it belongs to two\ndeities: 'For the sake of concord between the two deities let it be a black-\nspotted (buck)!' they say; 'for that is most like those two (gods).' If he be\nunable to obtain a black-spotted buck, it may be a red-spotted one.\n\n3:3:4:2424\\. Thereon he makes (the sacrificer) say (Va _g_. S. IV, 35; Rig-\nveda X; 37, 1); 'Homage be to the eye of Mitra and Varu _n_ a! perform ye\ndiligently this holy service to the god! sing ye unto the far-seeing, god-born\nlight, to Surya, the son of the sky!' Thereby he renders homage to it (the\nvictim) and makes it a token of the covenant.\n\n3:3:4:2525\\. The Adhvaryu then removes the Soma-wrapper. With (Va _g_. S. IV,\n36) 'Thou art Varu _n_ a's stay,' he props (the cart) with the prop. With 'Ye\ntwo are the rest of Varu _n_ a's stay,' he pulls out the two wedges. The\nreason why he says, 'Ye two are the rest of Varu _n_ a's stay 2,' is that he,\nthe bought Soma, now indeed is of Varu _n_ a 3.\n\np. 84\n\n3:3:4:2626\\. Thereupon four men take up the king's throne; two men, it is\ntrue, take it up for the human king, but four take up this for him who rules\nover everything here.\n\n3:3:4:2727\\. It is of udumbara wood--udumbara meaning sap and food--for (the\nsacrificer's) obtainment of sap and food: therefore it is of udumbara wood.\n\n3:3:4:2828\\. It reaches up to his navel, for it is there that the food\nsettles, and Soma is food: therefore it reaches up to his navel. Moreover,\nthere is the seat of the seed, and Soma is seed: therefore it reaches up to\nhis navel.\n\n3:3:4:2929\\. He (the Adhvaryu) touches it with, 'Thou art the rightful seat (\n_ri_ tasadani) of Varu _n_ a!' He then spreads on it the black deerskin with,\n'Thou art the rightful seat ( _ri_ tasadanam) of Varu _n_ a!' and places him\n(Soma) thereon with, 'Seat thee on the rightful seat of Varu _n_ a!' The\nreason why he says, 'Seat thee on the rightful seat of Varu _n_ a,' is that he\n(Soma) is now of Varu _n_ a's nature.\n\n3:3:4:3030\\. Thereupon he makes him (king Soma) enter the hall; and in making\nhim enter, he causes (the sacrificer) to say (Va _g_. S. IV, 37; Rig-veda I,\n91, 19), 'Whatsoever powers of thine they worship with offering, may they all\nencompass the sacrifice 1! Go forth to our dwellings, O Soma, prospering our\nhomes, ever helpful, bestowing abundance of men, not slaying our\n\np. 85\n\nmen!' dwellings meaning houses, he thereby means to say, 'Go forth to our\nhouses, kind, propitious, not doing evil.'\n\n3:3:4:3131\\. Some now pour out a vessel of water beside him, saying that this\nwould be as. one would bring water for a king that has come to him. But let\nhim not do this, for they (who do this) do at the sacrifice what is human, and\ninauspicious for the sacrifice forsooth is that which is human: let him\ntherefore not pour out water, lest he should do at the sacrifice what is\ninauspicious.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[75:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_200) The cart stands south of the place where the\npurchase of Soma took place, with the shafts towards the east, fitted with all\nthe appliances, and yoked with a pair of oxen. The antelope skin is spread\nwith the hairy side upwards, and the neck part towards the east.\n\n[75:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_201) See I, 1, 4, 1 seq. The Ka _n_ va text has: 'the\nsignificance of this ya _g_ us is the same.'\n\n[75:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_202) In Rig-veda VIII, 42, 1, this verse relates to Varu\n_n_ a. In adapting it to the present sacrificial requirements, 'v _ri_ shabho\n( _ri_ shabho, K.) antariksham' has been substituted for the original 'asuro\nvi _s_ vaveda _h_ ;' Soma being meant by 'the bull.'\n\n[76:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_203) Or, superior to (beyond the reach of) the slayer\n(or the blow), ' _g_ yaya _m_ sa _m_ vadhat.'\n\n[77:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_204) 'Into the waters (apsu),' Rig-veda.\n\n[77:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_205) See [III, 2, 1, 1](sbe2607.htm#3:2:1:1) seq.\n\n[77:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_206) He is to fasten it to a staff fixed to the pole of\nthe cart near the yoke. Katy. VII, 9, 9.\n\n[77:4](sbe2614.htm#fr_207) The Subrahma _n_ ya is one of the assistants of the\nUdgat _ri_ (chanter of Sama-hymns). He stands on the ground between the two\nshafts in front of the yoke; the two planks, according to Saya _n_ a, reaching\nup to his chin.\n\n[78:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_208) See I, 7, 1, I; part i, p. 183. According to Ait.\nBr. III, 26, K _ri_ sanu the Soma-keeper's arrow cut off one of the talons of\nGayatri's left foot, which was turned into a porcupine.\n\n[79:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_209) Apalamba, a piece of wood fastened to the back part\nof the cart to prevent its running backwards when going up-hill; or, according\nto others, a rope used for retarding the progress of the cart in going down-\nhill. Katy. VII, 9, 15 comm. The cart stands with the oxen towards the east;\nit is then wheeled round towards the right to the west and driven to the hall,\nin front of which it is turned towards the north; the Soma being then taken\ndown. See Ait. Br. I, 14.\n\n[79:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_210) The duties of the Hot _ri_ , while the Soma-cart is\ndriven to the hall, are set forth \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ rautas. IV, 4: He stands three\nfeet behind the cart between the two wheel tracks, and throws thrice dust\ntowards the south with the fore-part of his foot without moving the heel, with\nthe formula, 'Thou art wise, thou art intelligent, thou upholding all things:\ndrive away the danger arising from men!' Thereupon, after uttering the sound\n'Him,' he recites eight verses, or, the first and last being recited thrice\neach, in all twelve verses. Cf. Ait. Br. I, 13. He first remains standing in\nthe same place and recites thrice the first verse. Then in following the cart\nhe recites the five following verses. The cart having now stopped, he walks\nround it on its right (south) side, and while looking on the Soma follows it\nwhile it is placed on the throne. He then touches it and completes his\nrecitation by the last two verses. The first of these two verses is the same\nwhich the sacrificer is to mutter (with the Adhvaryu) while Soma is carried\ninto the hall, and which is given in [paragraph 30](sbe2614.htm#3:3:4:30).\n\n[79:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_211) While the Soma is driven to the hall, the\nsacrificer has to hold on to it from behind.\n\n[79:4](sbe2614.htm#fr_212) 'Asya ra _g_ ana _h_ sabhaga _h_ ;'--Soma seems to\nbe compared here with an emperor or overlord of kings (adhira _g_ o ra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nam, V, 4,2,2), who is holding a royal court (ra _g_ asabha), or a Darbar, to\nwhich the under-kings are flocking. Saya _n_ a seems to interpret the passage\ndifferently: apy asya ra _g_ ana _h_ iti sabhaga ity anena ra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am\nanatikrama _n_ iyam p. 80 uktam bhavati; api sambhavanayam madhuparkam aha 'ra\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e _k_ a _k_ arya _s_ va _s_ urapit _ri_ vyamatulana _m_ _k_ eti' (\xc3\x82\n_s_ v. G _ri_ hyas. I, 24) sambhavaniyanam madhye ra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am prathamato\nnirdi _s_ ena (!) _s_ resh _th_ yavagamad itarapu _g_ yopalakshakatvenapy asya\nra _g_ ana iti nirde _s_ a iti mantavyam, ra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a agatan svayam prahva\neva san purvas tebhya _h_ prag evabhivadati vagvyavahara _m_ karoti. The Ka\n_n_ va text reads: For he is his gracious lord, therefore he heeds not even a\nking; and yet (?) he is the first to salute the kings: thus he is indeed\ngracious to him: 'esha va etasya bhadro bhavati, tasmad esha na ra _g_ ana _m_\n_k_ anadriyate 'tho purvo ra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ o 'bhivadati tathasyaisha eva bhadro\nbhavati(!).'\n\n[80:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_213) Or, they can only shoot after his body, ' _s_\nariram evanvavahanti.' The Ka _n_ va text has athasyeda _m_ _s_ ariram evanasa\n'nvavahanti,' i.e. 'Now they only bring his body with the cart.' The MS. of\nSaya _n_ a also has 'anvavahanti,' but it explains it by ' _s_ yenibhavad\nupadeyasya sara _m_ _s_ asya badhabhavad dhanta _s_ ariram evanugatya hanti\nnatmanam.'\n\n[81:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_214) This myth, according to which Indra was supposed to\nhave assumed the form of a ram and to have carried off Medhatithi, the Ka _n_\nva (or, according to others, to have robbed him of his Soma), appears to be\nalluded to in Rig-veda VIII, 2, 40. On the possible connection of the myth\nwith the Greek one of Ganymede, see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 40. Saya _n_ a\ndoes not explain the Subrahma _n_ ya formula, but remarks, that he has already\ndone so in the Sama-brahma _n_ a (viz. in the Sha _d_ vi _m_ _s_ a).\n\n[81:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_215) According to Rig-veda I, 51, 13, Indra became the\nwife (mena) of V _ri_ sha _n_ a _s_ va (Mena); the reason for this\ntransformation being, according to the Sha _d_ vi _m_ _s_ a Br., that he was\nin love with Mena or Menaka, the daughter of that king (or sage). Ind. Stud.\nI, p. 38. The later explanation of the simple statement of the _Ri_ k seems of\ndoubtful authenticity, unless the choice of the word mena for 'wife' was\nintended by the bard as an allusion to the name of the king's daughter. It is\nmore likely that the myth alluded to in the _Ri_ k had been forgotten at the\ntime of the Brahma _n_ as, and a new version of it was invented, based on the\n'mena' of the original. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 383, takes Mena here as a\nname.\n\n[81:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_216) This is another of Indra's love-myths about which\nvery little is known. Ahalya (Maitreyi) is said to have been the wife of the\n_Ri_ shi Gautama (or of Kau _s_ ika, according to Sha _d_ v. Br.) and to have\nbeen loved by Indra.\n\n[82:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_217) According to Saya _n_ a on Rig-veda I, 10, 11\n(where Indra is called Kau _s_ ika, 'favourable to the Ku _s_ ikas') Ku _s_\nika desired to have a son equal to Indra, whence the latter was born as Ku _s_\nika's son Gathin (Gadhin). Differently Say. on Taitt. \xc3\x82r. I, 12, 4.\n\n[82:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_218) The Sha _d_ v. Br. (Ind. Stud. I, p. 38) explains\nthis as follows:--The Gods and Asuras were at war with each other. Gotama was\nperforming austerities between them. Indra went up to him and said, 'Go out as\nour spy.' 'I cannot,' he replied. 'Then I will go in your form.' 'As thou\nthinkest fit!' And because he (Indra) went about in the form of Gotama,\npassing himself off as Gotama, therefore he says, 'thou who callest thee\nGotama.'\n\n[82:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_219) The Ka _n_ va text also states that this last\nportion of the formula was devised by \xc3\x82ru _n_ i, but nothing is said as to its\nuse being optional.\n\n[82:4](sbe2614.htm#fr_220) For variations of this concluding part of the\nSubrahma _n_ ya in different schools, see La _t_ y. _S_ r. I, 3, 3 seq.; also\nnotes to [III, 9, 3, 10](sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:10); IV, 9, 6, 25 (?); Haug,\nTransl. Ait. Br. p. 383.\n\n[82:5](sbe2614.htm#fr_221) See [III, 1, 3, 1](sbe2605.htm#3:1:3:1) seq.\n\n[83:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_222) 'By this victim he redeems himself, the victim, and\nwith that redeemed self, now his own, he sacrifices.' Ka _n_ va rec.\n\n[83:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_223) Skambha visar _g_ ani ('support or pin of the\nprop') is taken by Saya _n_ a in the sense of 'offshoot of the prop' or 'that\nwhich is let go (s _ri_ sh _t_ a) by the prop.'\n\n[83:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_224) I.e. belongs to Varu _n_ a or is of Varu _n_ a's\nnature (varu _n_ yo p. 84 bhavati). Saya _n_ a (if the MS. is correct) takes\nit in the sense of 'is Varu _n_ a himself,' etasmin kritavasare somo varu _n_\no bhavati.\n\n[84:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_225) Or, 'may the sacrifice encompass them all,' if,\nwith Grassmann and Ludwig, we read 'ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_ ' instead of 'ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nam.' This verse is likewise recited (? at the same time) by the Hot _ri_ , see\np. 79, note 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 1. Fourth Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe2615.htm)\n\n"
