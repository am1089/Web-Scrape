Verily, he who purifies (Vayu) is the sacrifice, for he (the air) moving\nalong purifies everything.\n\np. 69\n\n[paragraph continues] Because moving along he purifies everything, therefore\nhe is the sacrifice. Of that sacrifice there are two ways, by mind and by\nspeech.\n\n2\\. The Brahman priest performs one of them in his mind 1, the Hot _ri_ ,\nAdhvaryu, and Udgat _ri_ priests perform the other by words. When the Brahman\npriest, after the Prataranuvaka ceremony has begun, but before the recitation\nof the Paridhaniya hymn, has (to break his silence and) to speak,\n\n3\\. He performs perfectly the one way only (that by words), but the other is\ninjured. As a man walking on one foot, or a carriage going on one wheel, is\ninjured, his sacrifice is injured, and with the injured sacrifice the\nsacrificer is injured; yes, having sacrificed, he becomes worse.\n\n4\\. But when after the Prataranuvaka ceremony has begun, and before the\nrecitation of the Paridhaniya hymn, the Brahman priest has not (to break his\nsilence and) to speak, they perform both ways perfectly, and neither of them\nis injured.\n\n5\\. As a man walking on two legs and a carriage going on two wheels gets on,\nso his sacrifice gets on, and with the successful sacrifice the sacrificer\ngets on; yes, having sacrificed, he becomes better.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[68:3](sbe01093.htm#fr_221) If any mistakes happen during the performance of a\nsacrifice, as described before, they are remedied by certain interjectional p.\n69 syllables (vyah _ri_ ti), the nature of which is next described. All this\nis supposed to take place in the forest.\n\n[69:1](sbe01093.htm#fr_222) While the other priests perform the sacrifice, the\nBrahman priest has to remain silent, following the whole sacrifice in his\nmind, and watching that no mistake be committed. If a mistake is committed, he\nhas to correct it, and for that purpose certain corrective penances (praya _s_\n_k_ itta) are enjoined. The performance of the Brahman priest resembles the\nmeditations of the sages in the forest, and therefore this chapter is here\ninserted.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 17](sbe01094.htm)\n\n'
