Behold it thus by the vision of the higher\nSelf, with mind full of peace, in every mode of being. A certain Being, apart\nfrom form, is seen everywhere, of those who have eyes to see. Therefore\nknowers of the Eternal understand that whatever is other than this, is but the\nsport and workmanship of intellect.\n\nWho, being wise, and tasting that essence of supreme bliss, would delight any\nmore in things of emptiness? Who desires to look on a painted moon, when the\nmoon, the giver of delight, is shining?\n\nFor through enjoyment of unreal things, there is no contentment at all, nor\nany getting rid of pain. Therefore contented by enjoying the essence of\nsecondless bliss, stand thou rejoicing, resting on the Self that is true\nBeing.\n\np. 82\n\nTherefore beholding thyself everywhere, and considering thyself as secondless,\nlet the time go by for thee, mighty minded one, rejoicing in the bliss that is\nthine own.\n\nAnd wavering doubt in the Self of partless awakening which wavers not, is but\nof fancy\'s building; therefore through the Self which is formed of secondless\nbliss, entering into lasting peace, adore in silence.\n\nIn the silence is the highest peace, because wavering is the intellect\'s\nunreal work; there the knowers of the Eternal, mighty-souled, enjoy unbroken\nhappiness of partless bliss, recognizing the Self as the Eternal.\n\nThere is no higher cause of joy than silence where no mind-pictures dwell; it\nbelongs to him who has understood the Self\'s own being; who is full of the\nessence of the bliss of the Self.\n\nWhether walking or standing, sitting or lying down, or wherever he may be, let\nthe sage dwell according to his will, the wise man finding joy ever within\nhimself.\n\nNo distinctions of place or time, position or space are to be regarded as\nbringing release from bondage, for the mighty-souled, who has perfectly\nattained to reality. Of what avail are the rites of religion for one who has\nattained to wisdom?\n\nWhat religious rite will help one to know a jar, without having perceived it?\nBut where there is direct perception, the object is perfectly understood.\n[530]\n\nSo when there is direct perception, the Self shines forth clearly, without\nregard to place or time or rites of purification.\n\nThe direct knowledge, that "I am Devadatta," depends\n\np. 83\n\non nothing else; and it is precisely thus with the knowledge that "l am the\nEternal," in the case of the knower of the Eternal.\n\nHow could the not Self, the mere chaff of unreality, be the illuminer of that\nthrough the radiance of which the whole world shines, as through the sun?\n\nHow can the scriptures or laws or traditions, or even all beings, illumine\nthat by which alone they gain their worth?\n\nThis Self, self-illumined, is of unending power, immeasurable, the direct\nknowledge of all; knowing this, the knower of the Eternal, freed from bondage,\nmost excellent, gains the victory.\n\nThings of sense neither distress nor elate him beyond measure, nor is he\nattached to, or repelled by them; in the Self he ever joys, the Self is his\nrejoicing; altogether contented by the essence of uninterrupted bliss.\n\nAs a child, who is free from hunger and bodily pain, finds delight in play, so\nthe wise man rejoices, free from the sorrow of "I" and "mine."\n\nHis food is what is freely offered, eaten without anxiety or sense of poverty;\nhis drink is the pure water of the streams; he moves where fancy leads him,\nunconstrained; he sleeps by the river-bank, or in the wood; for his vesture\nis- one that grows not old or worn; his home is space; his couch, the world;\nhe moves in paths where the beaten road is ended; the wise man, delighting in\nthe supreme Eternal.\n\nDwelling in this body as a mere temporary halting-place, he meets the things\nof sense just as they come, like a child subject to another\'s will; thus lives\nthe\n\np. 84\n\nknower of the Self, who shows no outward sign, nor is attached to external\nthings.\n\nWhether clothed in space alone, or wearing other vestures, or clothed in\nskins, or in a vesture of thought; like one in trance, or like a child, or\nlike a shade, he walks the earth. [540]\n\nWithdrawing desire from the things of desire, ever contented in the Self, the\nsage stands firm through the Self alone.\n\nNow as a fool, now a wise man; now as a great and wealthy king; now a\nwanderer, now a sage; now dwelling like a serpent, solitary; now full of\nhonor; now rejected and unknown; thus the sage walks, ever rejoicing in\nperfect bliss.\n\nThough without wealth, contented ever; ever rejoicing, though without sensuous\nenjoyments; though not like others, yet ever seeming as the rest.\n\nEver active, though acting not at all; though tasting no experience, yet\nexperiencing all; bodiless, though possessing a body; though limited, yet\npenetrating all.\n\nThis knower of the Eternal, ever bodiless, things pleasant or painful touch\nnot at all, nor things fair or foul.\n\nFor pleasure and pain, things fair and foul, are for him who is bound by the\nvestures, who believes them real; but for him whose bonds are broken, for the\nsage whose Self is real Being, what fruit is fair, or what is foul?\n\nJust as in an eclipse of the sun, people say, "the sun is darkened," though\nthe sun indeed is not darkened,\n\np. 85\n\nand they speak ignorantly, knowing not the truth of things.\n\nThus verily they behold the most excellent knower of Brahma as though bound to\na body, while he is in truth freed for ever from the body, and they are\ndeluded by the mere seeming of the body.
