Now the consecration-ceremony 3 (for the sacrificial session) is a\nsitting down, is a session (sattra): hence they say of them, 'they sit.' And\nwhen thereafter they perform the sacrifice, then they (under)go; then he, who\nis the leader, leads: hence they say of them, 'they (under)go 4.'\n\np. 441\n\n4:6:8:22\\. The consecration-ceremony, then, is a sitting down, it is a\nsession, it is an (under)going, it is the (under)going of a session. And when\nafterwards, having reached the end of the sacrifice, they rise, that is 'the\nrising:' hence they say of them, 'They have risen.' So much, then, for\npreliminary remark.\n\n4:6:8:33\\. Now those who are about to consecrate themselves settle (the time\nand place) between them. If they intend to construct a fire-altar, they take\nup their (ordinary sacrificial) fires on churning-sticks 1 and betake\nthemselves together to where they are about to perform the animal offering to\nPra _g_ apati. Having churned (the fire), and put fire-wood on, they take out\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya fire, and perform that animal offering to Pra _g_ apati.\n\n4:6:8:44\\. Its head they keep 2. If their consecration does not fall upon that\nsame day (of the animal offering), then, taking up the fires (again) on the\nchurning-sticks, they disperse to their several (homes) and perform the\n(daily) offerings.\n\n4:6:8:55\\. But if their consecration falls upon that same day, then, taking up\nthe fires (again) on the churning-sticks, they betake themselves to where they\nintend to perform the consecration-ceremony. The G _ri_ hapati 3 churns (his\nfire) first somewhere about the centre of the hall; and one half of the others\nsettle down south and one half north of him. Having\n\np. 442\n\nchurned (their fires), and put on fire-wood, they take one fire-brand each and\nbetake themselves together to the G _ri_ hapati's Garhapatya fire. Having\ntaken out the \xc3\x82havaniya from the G _ri_ hapati's Garhapatya, they perform the\nconsecration-ceremony. They have one and the same \xc3\x82havaniya, but different\nGarhapatyas, during the consecration and the Upasads 1.\n\n4:6:8:66\\. Then, on whatever day their purchase (of Soma-plants) takes place,\non that day he raises the Garhapatya hearth; and on the Upavasatha day 2 the\ndhish _n_ ya hearths for the others. At the time of the Vaisar _g_ ina 3\nofferings, the wives come forward together and they (the sacrificers) abandon\nthose other (Garhapatya) fires 4. As soon as the Vaisar _g_ ina offering has\nbeen performed,--\n\n4:6:8:77\\. He leads forward the king (Soma). That \xc3\x82gnidhriya fire has just\nbeen taken up on the support 5, when they take one fire-brand each (from the\nfire at the hall-door) and disperse to their several dhish _n_ ya hearths:\n'They who do so,' said Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, 'slay with those fire-brands of\ntheirs.' This now is one way.\n\np. 443\n\n4:6:8:88\\. Then there is this second. Having taken up their fires on churning-\nsticks, they betake themselves to where they intend to perform the animal\noffering to Pra _g_ apati. Having churned (the fire), and put on (fire-wood),\nthey take out the \xc3\x82havaniya and perform that animal offering to Pra _g_ apati.\n\n4:6:8:99\\. Its head they keep. If their consecration does not fall upon the\nsame day, then, taking up the fires (again) on the churning-sticks, they\ndisperse to their several (homes), and perform (the ordinary) offerings.\n\n4:6:8:1010\\. But if their consecration falls upon the same day, then, taking\nup the fires (again) on the churning-sticks, they betake themselves to where\nthey intend to perform the consecration-ceremony. The G _ri_ hapati churns\nfirst, and then the others churn, seated round about him, and throw each the\n(fire) produced by him on the G _ri_ hapati's Garhapatya. Having taken out the\n\xc3\x82havaniya from the G _ri_ hapati's Garhapatya, they perform the Diksha. Theirs\nis the same \xc3\x82havaniya and the same Garhapatya during the consecration and the\nUpasads.\n\n4:6:8:1111\\. Then, on whatever day their purchase (of Soma-plants) takes\nplace, on that day he piles up the Garhapatya hearth, and on the Upavasatha\nday the dhish _n_ ya hearths for the others. At the time of the Vaisar _g_ ina\nofferings the wives come forward together; they (the sacrificers) abandon that\n(common Garhapatya) fire. As soon as the Vaisar _g_ ina offering has taken\nplace,--\n\n4:6:8:1212\\. He leads forward the king. That \xc3\x82gnidhriya fire has just been\ntaken up on the support, when they take one fire-brand each and disperse to\ntheir several dhish _n_ ya hearths. But those who do it thus, raise\n\np. 444\n\nup strife, and strife comes upon them; they become contentious, and, moreover,\nstrife comes upon that community where they sacrifice. This is the second way.\n\n4:6:8:1313\\. Then there is this third. They commune with each other over the G\n_ri_ hapati's churning-sticks,--'What fire shall be produced therefrom, be\nthat ours in common! what we shall gain by this sacrifice, by this animal\noffering, be that ours in common! In common be our good work! whosoever shall\ndo evil, be that his alone!' Having thus spoken, the G _ri_ hapati first takes\nup (the fire on the churning-sticks) for himself, then he takes it up for the\nothers, or they take it 1 up for themselves. They betake themselves to where\nthey intend to perform the animal offering to Pra _g_ apati. Having churned\n(the fire) and put on (fire-wood), they take out the \xc3\x82havaniya and perform\nthat animal offering to Pra _g_ apati.\n\n4:6:8:1414\\. Its head they keep. If their consecration does not fall on the\nsame day, then, taking up (again) the fires on the churning-sticks, they\ndisperse to their several (homes), and perform (the ordinary) offerings.\n\n4:6:8:1515\\. But if their consecration falls on the same day, they commune\nwith each other over the G _ri_ hapati's churning-sticks,--'What fire shall be\nproduced therefrom, be that ours in common! what we shall gain by this\nsacrifice, by this session, be that ours in common! In common be our good\nwork! Whosoever shall do evil, be that his alone!' Having thus spoken, the G\n_ri_ hapati first takes up (the fire) on the churning-sticks for himself, then\nhe takes it up for\n\np. 445\n\nthe others, or they take it up for themselves. They betake themselves to where\nthey intend to perform the consecration-ceremony. Having churned (the fire)\nand put on (fire-wood), they take out the \xc3\x82havaniya and perform the\nconsecration-ceremony. Theirs is the same \xc3\x82havaniya and the same Garhapatya\nduring the consecration and the Upasads.\n\n4:6:8:1616\\. And on whatever day their purchase (of Soma-plants) takes place,\non that day he piles up the Garhapatya hearth, and on the Upavasatha day the\ndhish _n_ ya hearths for the others. At the time of the Vaisar _g_ ina\nofferings the wives come forward together; and they (the sacrificers) abandon\nthat (Garhapatya) fire. As soon as the Vaisar _g_ ina offering has been\nperformed,\n\n4:6:8:1717\\. He leads forward the king. That \xc3\x82gnidhriya fire has just been\ntaken up on the support, when they take one fire-brand each and disperse to\ntheir several dhish _n_ ya hearths. Thus is this done, and not (left) undone.\nThe reason why they have different dhish _n_ yas, is that there may be wider\nspace for moving about; and why they have different puro _d_ a _s_ as 1, is\nthat more sacrificial food may be left over for completeness.\n\n4:6:8:1818\\. Now then the sacrificial session is explained, whereby the gods\nquickly drove out evil, and gained the supreme authority which they now wield:\nhaving one G _ri_ hapati, one puro _d_ a _s_ a, one dhish _n_ ya, they quickly\ndrove out mischief and quickly were born again. And in like manner will these\n(sacrificers), by having one G _ri_ hapati, one puro _d_ a _s_ a, one dhish\n_n_ ya, quickly drive out evil and be born again.\n\np. 446\n\n4:6:8:1919\\. Now, in that former case, there is a hall with the roof-beams\nrunning from south to north [1](sbe2678.htm#fn_1030),--that is human practice.\nThere are one and the same \xc3\x82havaniya, and different Garhapatyas--that is\ndissimilar. On the G _ri_ hapati's Garhapatya they perform the Patnisa _m_ ya\n_g_ as with the tail (of the victim), and the others sit offering in response\nwith ghee--that is dissimilar:\n\n4:6:8:2020\\. But here there is a hall with the roof-beams running from west to\neast [2](sbe2678.htm#fn_1031): that is as with the gods. There are the same\n\xc3\x82havaniya, the same Garhapatya, and the same \xc3\x82gnidhriya: thus this sacrificial\nsession is successful, even as the one day's Soma-sacrifice was successful,\nthere is no failure for it. Its course is one and the same in everything\nexcept the dhish _n_ yas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[440:3](sbe2677.htm#fr_1024) For the Diksha see [III, 1, 1,\n1](sbe2603.htm#3:1:1:1) seq. In the Ka _n_ va text I have found nothing\ncorresponding to the present Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[440:4](sbe2677.htm#fr_1025) That is to say, the verb 'i' (to go; more\nespecially its compound upa-i, to undergo, go through, undertake) is used of\nsacrificial performances in the Sattra lasting for twelve (pressing) days and\nupward, to distinguish the latter from the ahina-sacrifices, lasting for from\ntwo to twelve (pressing) days.\n\n[441:1](sbe2677.htm#fr_1026) That is to say, they hold their churning-sticks\nto the fires to get warm; see part i, p. 396, note 1.\n\n[441:2](sbe2677.htm#fr_1027) The head of the victim (or victims, see VI, 2, 1\nseq.) will have to be put in the bottom layer of the fire-altar, to impart\nstability to the latter.\n\n[441:3](sbe2677.htm#fr_1028) See [p. 97](sbe2616.htm#page_97), note\n[1](sbe2616.htm#fn_255). At a Sattra the G _ri_ hapati, as well as all the\nother _ri_ tvig, should be a Brahman; Katy. I, 6, 13-16.\n\n[442:1](sbe2677.htm#fr_1029) At Sattras there are usually twelve Upasad days.\nSee [p. 105](sbe2618.htm#page_105), note [1](sbe2618.htm#fn_273). Ait. Br. IV,\n24 enjoins twelve days for the Diksha and as many for the Upasads of the Dvada\n_s_ aha. Katy. XII, 1, 19; 2, 14 gives no special rule regarding the duration\nof the Diksha, but enjoins twelve Upasads. See also La _t_ y. III, 3, 27; \xc3\x82\n_s_ v.

XII, 2, 8-9, each takes up\ntwo fires, viz. his own and that of the G _ri_ hapati.\n\n[445:1](sbe2677.htm#fr_1035) The usual Savaniya-puro _d_ a _s_ as ([III, 8, 3,\n1](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:1)) are to be offered separately on each fire.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 6, 9.
