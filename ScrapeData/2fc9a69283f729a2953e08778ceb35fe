But on account of the teaching of the different one, Badaraya _n_ a's\n(view is valid); as this is seen.\n\nKnowledge by itself benefits man; since Scripture teaches that the object of\nknowledge is the highest Brahman which, as it is of an absolutely faultless\nand perfect nature, is other than the active individual soul.\n\nBadaraya _n_ a, therefore, holds that knowledge has an independent fruit of\nits own. Let the inferential marks (referred to by the Purvapakshin) be; the\ndirect teaching of the texts certainly refers to a being different from the\n\np. 690\n\n[paragraph continues] Self that acts; for we clearly see that their object is\nthe highest creative Brahman with all its perfections and exalted qualities,\nwhich cannot possibly be attributed to the individual Self whether in the\nstate of Release or of bondage: 'Free from evil, free from old age,' &c. &c.\nIn all those texts there is not the slightest trace of any reference to the\nwretched individual soul, as insignificant and weak as a tiny glow-worm,\nimplicated in Nescience and all the other evils of finite existence. And the\nfruit of that knowledge of the highest Person the texts expressly declare, in\nmany places, to be immortality--which consists in attaining to Him. The view\nof knowledge by itself benefitting man therefore is well founded.--The Sutras\nproceed to dispose of the so-called inferential marks.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9.
