[1897], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n8:4:1\n\n#### THE FOURTH LAYER.\n\n### FOURTH ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n8:4:1:11\\. He lays down the fourth layer. For the gods having laid down the\nthird layer, now ascended; but, the third layer being the air; it was the air\nwhich, having completed it, they ascended.\n\n8:4:1:22\\. They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed,\n\np. 59\n\nthey meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!'\nWhilst meditating, they saw that fourth layer, (to wit) what is above the air\nand below the heavens; that world was to their minds, as it were, unstable and\nunsettled.\n\n8:4:1:33\\. They said to the Brahman, 'We will lay thee down (or, set thee up)\nhere!'--'What will therefrom accrue to me?'--'Thou shalt be the highest of\nus!'--'So be it!' They accordingly laid the Brahman down here, whence people\nsay that the Brahman is the highest of gods. Now, by this fourth layer these\ntwo, heaven and earth, are upheld, and the fourth layer is the Brahman, whence\npeople say that heaven and earth are upheld by the Brahman. He lays down the\nStomas (hymn-forms) 1: the stomas being the vital airs, and the Brahman also\nbeing the vital airs, it is the Brahman he thereby lays down.\n\n8:4:1:44\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. The gods, at that\ntime, said to Pra _g_ apati, 'We will lay thee down here! So be it!' He did\nnot say, 'What will therefrom accrue unto me?' but whenever Pra _g_ apati\nwished to obtain anything from the gods, they said, 'What will therefrom\naccrue to us?' And hence even now if a father wishes to obtain anything from\nhis sons, they say, 'What will therefrom\n\np. 60\n\naccrue unto us?' and when the sons (wish to obtain anything) from the father,\nhe says, 'So be it!' for in this way Pra _g_ apati and the gods used of old to\nconverse together. He lays down the Stomas: the stomas being the vital airs,\nand Pra _g_ apati also being the vital airs, it is Pra _g_ apati he thus lays\ndown.\n\n8:4:1:55\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. Those vital airs,\nthe _Ri_ shis 1, that saw this fourth layer 2, and who stepped nigh with that\nessential element (of the altar), are these (vital airs): it is them he now\nlays down. He lays down the Stomas:--the stomas being the vital airs, and the\n_Ri_ shis also being the vital airs, it is the _Ri_ shis he thus lays down.\n\n8:4:1:66\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. When Pra _g_ apati\nhad become relaxed (disjointed), the gods took him and went away. Vayu, taking\nthat (part) of him which was above the waist and below the head, kept going\naway from him, having become the deities and the forms of the year.\n\n8:4:1:77\\. He spake to him, 'Come to me and restore to me that wherewith thou\nhast gone from me!'--'What will therefrom accrue unto me?'--'That part of my\nself shall be sacred unto thee!'--'So be it!' thus Vayu restored that unto\nhim.\n\n8:4:1:88\\. Those eighteen (bricks 3) which there are at\n\np. 61\n\nfirst, are that very (part) of his (Pra _g_ apati's) body; and when he places\nthem in this (layer), he thereby restores to him that (part) of his body which\nthese (form): therefore he places them in this (layer). He lays down the\nStomas: the stomas being the vital airs, and Vayu (the wind) also being the\nvital airs, it is Vayu he thus lays down.\n\n8:4:1:99\\. In front he lays down one, with (Va _g_. S. XIV, 23), 'The swift\none, the Triv _ri_ t!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is triv\n_ri_ t (threefold, or thrice-three-versed). And as to why he calls it 'the\nswift one,' it is because this, indeed, is the swiftest of stomas. But the\nswift threefold one, doubtless, is Vayu: he exists in these three worlds. And\nas to why he calls him 'the swift one,' it is because he is the swiftest of\nall beings: being (or, in the form of) Vayu it remained in front,--it is that\nform he now lays down,\n\n8:4:1:1010\\. [The back one 1, with], 'The bright one 2, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_\na!' he therewith lays down that\n\np. 62\n\nhymn-form which is fifteenfold (fifteen-versed). And when he calls it 'the\nbright one,' it is that the bright one is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt\nis fifteenfold. But the bright, fifteenfold one, doubtless, also is the Moon:\nhe waxes during fifteen days, and wanes during fifteen days. And as to his\ncalling him 'the bright one,' the Moon indeed shines: being the Moon it\nremained on the right side,--it is that form he now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:1111\\. [The left (north) one, with], 'The (aerial) space, the Saptada\n_s_ a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is seventeenfold. And as\nto his calling it 'the space,'--the (aerial) space is Pra _g_ apati, and the\nseventeenfold one is Pra _g_ apati. But indeed the seventeenfold space also is\nthe year: in it there are twelve months and five seasons. And as to his\ncalling it space, the year indeed is space: being space, it remained on the\nleft side,--it is that form he now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:1212\\. [The right (south) one, with], 'The upholder, the Ekavi _m_ _s_\na!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-one-fold. And as to\nhis calling it 'the upholder,'--the upholder means a foothold, and the Ekavi\n_m_ _s_ a is a foothold. But indeed the twenty-one-fold upholder also is\nyonder sun: to him belong the twelve months, the five seasons, these three\nworlds, and yonder sun himself is the upholder, the twenty-one-fold. And as to\nhis calling him 'the upholder,'--when he sets everything here holds its peace:\nbeing the sun, it remained at the back,--it is that form he now lays down; and\nthe forms of the year he lays down.\n\n8:4:1:1313\\. 'Speed, the Ash _t_ ada _s_ a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-\nform which is eighteenfold. Now,\n\np. 63\n\nspeed, the eighteenfold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve\nmonths, five seasons, and the year itself is speed, the eighteenfold. And as\nto his calling it 'speed,' the year indeed speeds all beings: it is that form\nhe now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:1414\\. 'Heat, the Navada _s_ a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form\nwhich is nineteenfold. But heat, the nineteenfold one, doubtless, is the year:\nin it there are twelve months, six seasons, and the year itself is heat, the\nnineteenfold. And as to his calling it 'heat,' the year indeed burns all\nbeings: it is that form he now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:1515\\. 'Victorious assault, the Savi _m_ _s_ a!' he therewith lays down\nthat hymn-form which is twentyfold. But victorious assault, the twentyfold\none, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve months, seven seasons, and\nthe year itself is victorious assault, the twentyfold. And as to why he calls\nit 'victorious assault,' the year indeed assails all beings: it is that form\nhe now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:1616\\. 'Vigour, the Dvavi _m_ _s_ a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-\nform which is twenty-two-fold. But vigour, the twenty-two-fold one, doubtless\nis the year: in it there are twelve months, seven seasons, the two, day and\nnight, and the year itself is vigour, the twenty-two-fold. And as to why he\ncalls it 'vigour,' the year is indeed the most vigorous of all existing\nthings: it is that form he now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:1717\\. 'The array, the Trayovi _m_ _s_ a!' he therewith lays down that\nhymn-form which is twenty-three-fold. But array, the twenty-three-fold one,\ndoubtless, means the year: in it there are thirteen months, seven seasons, the\ntwo, day and night, and the year itself is the array, the twenty-three-fold.\n\np. 64\n\n[paragraph continues] And as to his calling it 'array,' the year is indeed\narrayed over all beings: it is that form he now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:1818\\. 'The womb, the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a!' he therewith lays down that\nhymn-form which is twenty-four-fold. But the womb, the twenty-four-fold one,\ndoubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months. And as to his\ncalling it 'the womb,' the year is indeed the womb of all beings: it is that\nform he now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:1919\\. 'The embryos, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avi _m_ _s_ a!' he therewith lays\ndown that hymn-form which is twenty-five-fold. But the embryos, the twenty-\nfive-fold one, doubtless; is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-\nmonths, and the year itself is the embryos, the twenty-five-fold. And as to\nhis calling it 'the embryos,'--the year, as an embryo, in the shape of the\nthirteenth month, enters the seasons: it is that form he now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:2020\\. 'Strength, the Tri _n_ ava!' he therewith lays down that hymn-\nform which is thrice ninefold. And as to his calling it 'strength,'--strength\n(o _g_ as) means the thunderbolt (va _g_ ra), and the Tri _n_ ava is a\nthunderbolt. But strength also means the year: in it there are twenty-four\nhalf-months, the two, day and night, and the year itself is strength, the\nthrice-ninefold. And as to his calling it 'strength,' the year indeed is the\nstrength of all beings: it is that form he now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:2121\\. 'Design, the Ekatri _m_ _s_ a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-\nform which is thirty-one-fold. But design, the thirty-one-fold, doubtless,\nmeans the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, six seasons, and the\nyear itself is design, the thirty-one-fold. And\n\np. 65\n\nas to his calling it 'design,' the year indeed designs (makes, forms) all\nbeings: it is that form he now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:2222\\. 'The foundation, the Trayastri _m_ _s_ a!' he therewith lays down\nthat hymn-form which is thirty-three-fold. And as to why he calls it 'the\nfoundation,' the thirty-three-fold is indeed a foundation. But indeed the\nfoundation, the thirty-three-fold, also is the year: in it there are twenty-\nfour half-months, six seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is\nthe foundation, the thirty-three-fold. And as to his calling it 'the\nfoundation,' the year is indeed the foundation of all beings: it is that form\nhe now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:2323\\. 'The range of the ruddy one, the _K_ atustri _m_ _s_ a!' he\ntherewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-four-fold. But the range of\nthe ruddy one (the sun), the thirty-four-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in\nit there are twenty-four half-months, seven seasons, the two, day and night,\nand the year itself is the range of the ruddy one, the thirty-four-fold. And\nas to his calling it 'the range of the ruddy one,' the range of the ruddy one,\ndoubtless, means supreme sway, and the thirty-four-fold one means supreme\nsway: it is that form he now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:2424\\. 'The firmament, the Sha _t_ tri _m_ _s_ a!' he therewith lays\ndown that hymn-form which is thirty-six-fold. But the firmament, the thirty-\nsix-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-moons,\nand twelve months. And as to why he calls it 'the firmament' (nakam), it is\nbecause there is no pain (na akam) for whosoever goes there. And the firmament\nindeed is the year, the heavenly world is the year: it is that form he now\nlays down.\n\np. 66\n\n8:4:1:2525\\. 'The revolving sphere, the Ash _t_ a _k_ atvari _m_ _s_ a!' he\ntherewith lays down that hymn-form which is forty-eight-fold. But the\nrevolving sphere, the forty-eight-fold, doubtless, is the year: in it there\nare twenty-six half-months, thirteen months, seven seasons, and the two, day\nand night. And as to his calling it 'the revolving sphere,' from the year all\ncreatures indeed are evolved: it is that form he now lays down.\n\n8:4:1:2626\\. 'The stay, the _K_ atush _t_ oma!' he therewith lays down the\nchant of praise consisting of four stomas 1. And as to his calling it 'the\nstay,'--stay means support, and the _K_ atush _t_ oma is a support. But the\nstay, the _K_ atush _t_ oma, doubtless, is Vayu (the wind), for he sings from\nall those four quarters. And as to his calling him 'the stay,'--stay means\nsupport; and the wind indeed is the support of all beings: it is that form he\nnow lays down. The wind he places first and last: by the wind he thus encloses\nall these beings on both sides.\n\n8:4:1:2727\\. These, then, are eighteen bricks he lays down; this makes two\nTriv _ri_ ts,--the Triv _ri_ t being breath, and breath being wind, this layer\nis Vayu.\n\n8:4:1:2828\\. And as to why there are eighteen,--the year is eighteenfold:\ntwelve months and six seasons. And Pra _g_ apati indeed is the year, Pra _g_\napati is eighteenfold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so\ngreat he makes it when he lays it down.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[59:1](sbe4315.htm#fr_131) This refers to the first eighteen bricks of the\nfourth layer; but as the names of the bricks (ish _t_ aka, f.) are invariably\nof the feminine gender, it is doubtful whether stoma (m.), in this case, is\nmeant as the designation of these bricks, or merely as their symbolical\nanalogon. In the former case, one would rather, from the analogy of other\nbricks, expect some such term as 'stomya.' To the first four of them\nMahidhara, on Va _g_. S. XIV, 23, applies the epithet m _ri_ tyumohini, or\n'confounders of death.'\n\n[60:1](sbe4315.htm#fr_132) See VI, 1, 1, 1; VII, 2, 3, 5.\n\n[60:2](sbe4315.htm#fr_133) See VI, 2, 3, 7. 8.\n\n[60:3](sbe4315.htm#fr_134) These eighteen bricks, representing the Stomas, or\nhymn-forms, are laid down in the following order. At each end of the spine\n(running from west to east) one brick, of the size of the shank (from knee to\nankle), is placed, with its line-marks running from west to east; the eastern\none being placed north, and the western one south, of the spine. Thereupon an\nordinary brick, a foot square, is placed p. 61 at the southern end of the\n'cross-spine,' so as to lie on the spine (though not apparently exactly in the\nmiddle, but so that only one-fourth of the brick lies on one side of the\nspine) with its line-marks running from south to north; and a second brick of\nthe same size is placed on the north, but so as to leave the full space of\nanother such brick between it and the northern edge of the altar. Behind (west\nof) the front brick, fourteen half-foot bricks are then laid down, in a row\nfrom north to south, seven on each side of the spine.\n\n[61:1](sbe4315.htm#fr_135) The formulas of the first four of these (stoma)\nbricks are not given here (in paragraphs\n[9](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:9)-[12](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:12)) in the order in which the\nbricks are actually laid down, viz. E. W. S. N., but in the order E. S. N. W.;\ncp. Katyay. _S_ rautas. XVII, 10, 6-9. For a symbolic explanation of this\nchange of order see [VIII, 4, 4, 1](sbe4318.htm#8:4:4:1) seq.\n\n[61:2](sbe4315.htm#fr_136) Or, perhaps, 'the angry one.' The author of the\nBrahma _n_ a, however, evidently connects 'bhanta' with the root 'bha,' to\nshine.\n\n[66:1](sbe4315.htm#fr_137) For particulars on the _K_ atush _t_ oma, see note\non [XIII, 1, 3, 4](sbe4305.htm#8:1:3:4).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 4, 2.
