The Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93The great legendary story, the life of S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a, supremely divine, destructive of all sins, has been narrated by you, O\nSuta! But, O Blessed One! You, though highly intelligent, have dwelt on it not\nat a great length; hence many doubts are cropping up in our minds. A very\ndifficult tapasya was performed by Vasudeva the part incarnate of Vi _sn_ u,\nwho had to go to forest to worship S\xc2\x92iva. Next, it has been known that the\nDevi Parvati, the part incarnate of the Great Mother, the Mother of the\nuniverse, the Supreme, and Perfect offered boons to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. How did\nit then come to pass that S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, being himself the God, had to\nworship Parvati and Mahadeva? Is it that S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a was inferior to\nMahadeva and Parvati? This is our doubt.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n6-7. Suta spoke :-- \xc2\x93Hear then, the reasons, O noble Ri _s_ is! that I heard\nfrom Vyasa; I will now sing before you those meritorious deeds S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_\na.\xc2\x94 The son of Parik _s_ it, the intelligent Janamejaya had also the same\ndoubts that you now have, when he heard the story before from Vyasa; and he\nasked the same questions that you now ask.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n8-11. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O son of Bhagavati! I have heard from you much\nabout the Supreme Goddess, the Highest Cause; still the doubts are not leaving\nme. O Fortunate One! Kri _sn_ a the Deva of the Devas, the Vi _sn_ u\nincarnate, worshipped Sambhu and had to perform dire penances; this is my\ngreat wonder! He is the soul of all the Jivas, the One Ruler and Lord of this\nworld and He is able to confer all the Siddhis; how is it, then, that the Lord\nHari had to perform very difficult asceticism like an ordinary mortal. He who\nis able to create this universe, moving and non-moving, He who is able to\npreserve and destroy it, why did He practise such a terrible penance.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n12-54. Vyasa said :-- \xc2\x93True it has been said by you that Vasudeva the\nJanardana, is the destroyer of the Daityas and He is able to create\n\n\n\np. 354\n\n\n\nand preserve the Devas and do all other acts for them. But the Great Lord\nassumed a human body; therefore he had to perform his duties like a man and\nobserve the Var _n_ a and \xc3\x82s'rama Dharmas pertaining to human beings.\nRespecting the elderly persons, worshipping the spiritual teachers, doing\nservice to the Brahma _n_ as, adoring and propitiating the Devas, feeling\nsorrow at times of sorrow, feeling pleasure at times of happiness, feeling\ndejection or expressing censure or scandal, or having sexual intercourse with\nwomen, in other words, to feel lust, anger, greediness and other passions when\ntheir proper time arises. All these are natural to all human beings; how can,\nthen, S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a though intrinsically of pure qualities, become Nirgu _n_\na (devoid of human qualities) when he assumed a human body which is Sagu _n_\na, i.e., with qualities. O Ruler of men! The extinction of the Yadava race by\nthe curse of Gandhari, the daughter of Subala, and the curse of a Brahmi _n_ ,\nKri _sn_ a's leaving his human coil, the stealing away of his wives, the\nrobbing of their wealth on the way by the dacoits of the \xc3\x82vira tribe, Arjuna's\nbecoming powerless to hurl any weapons on those dacoits, Kri _sn_ a's not\nknowing anything about the stealing away of Pradyumna and Aniruddha from his\nDvarka palace, these all correspond verily to exertions and failings\nappropriate to human bodies. Again the Ri _s_ i Naraya _n_ a is the part\nincarnate of Vi _sn_ u, and Vasudeva is the part incarnate of the Ri _s_ i\nNaraya _n_ a; hence what wonder is there, if Vasudeva be seen to adore and\npropitiate S\xc2\x92iva? S\xc2\x92iva is the God of gods; and He is the Lord of all the\ncausal bodies that exist; in the state of Su _s_ upti (deep sleep). In this\nrespect, S\xc2\x92iva is the creator of Vi _sn_ u and Vi _sn_ u worships Him in this\nlight. Rama, Kri _sn_ a and others are all part incarnations of Vi _sn_ u; so\nthere is no wonder if they worship S\xc2\x92iva. The letter A is Bhagvan Brahma ; the\nletter \xc2\x93U\xc2\x94 is Bhagvan Hari; the letter \xc2\x93M\xc2\x94 is Bhagvan Rudra and the half\nletter _m_ is Mahes'vari, the Supreme Mother of the universe. The sages,\ntherefore, consider Vi _sn_ u superior to Brahma; they again consider Rudra\nsuperior to Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'vari (Turiya State) again superior to Rudra.\nThe speciality of the half letter is that it can never be uttered; it is the\nsymbol of the Eternal Devi. In all the S'astras, therefore, the superiority of\nthe Devi is established. Vi _sn_ u is superior to Brahma; Rudra is superior to\nVi _sn_ u. Therefore no doubt can arise in Kri _sn_ a's worshipping S\xc2\x92iva. It\nis through the will of S\xc2\x92iva that a second Rudra originated from the forehead\nof Brahma to offer boons to him (i. e., to Brahma). This second Rudra is\nvenerable and entitled to all worship; what to speak of the First Rudra? O\nKing! It is through the proximity of the Devi that the importance and\nsuperiority of S\xc2\x92iva is thus established. Thus the incarnations of Hari arise\nin yugas after yugas through the intervention of the Yoga\n\n\n\np. 355\n\n\n\nMaya; so there is no need to discuss on this point. Why to Achyuta alone, to\nBrahma and S\xc2\x92iva also She gives troubles for getting involved into\nincarnations, She the Yoga Maya who is indirectly, with the twinklings of Her\neyes, creating, preserving and destroying this universe. It is the Yoga Maya\nthat caused Kri _sn_ a to be transferred from his lying-in chamber to the\nvillage Vraja and then protected him in the house of the cowherd Nanda;\nafterwards took him to Mathura for the destruction of Kamsa, whence he was led\nagain out of Jarasandha's fear to the city Dvarka. It is She that created from\nHer Ownself the eight Naikas (the leading mistresses) and also sixteen\nthousand and fifty women for the pleasure and enjoyment of Kri _sn_ a Bhagwan,\nthe incarnation of Ananta (Vi _sn_ u Bhagavan); thus Kri _sn_ a Bhagavan was\nmade completely subservient to them just like a perfect slave. When a young\nwoman, though she is alone, can bind a man down by the network of Maya, like\nstrong iron chain, what wonder is there that the sixteen thousand and fifty\nwomen would make Kri _sn_ a play in their hands like a S\xc2\x92uka bird and make him\nan instrument to serve any purpose that they liked. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a got\nhimself so much under the control of Satyabhama that He went gladly under her\ncommands to Indra's heavens to get the Parijata flowers. There he had to fight\nwith Indra and subsequently stole away the Parijata tree and gave it to\nSatyabhama as a very valuable ornament to be kept in her room. Behold! The\nsame Kri _sn_ a, by His own prowess, defeated S\xc2\x92is'upala and others for the\npreservation of religion and then stole away Rukmi _n_ i, the daughter of\nBhima and afterwards married her as his legal wife; where is the rule, then\nobserved that it is a sin to take away another's wife? Thus all embodied\nbeings get themselves subdued by Ahamkara and do acts, good or bad, confounded\nand deluded by the network of Moha that always drags one down below. From the\nMula Prakriti are born Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Hara and from the Tamasic\nAhamkara of Prakriti is created this whole cosmos, moving and non-moving. The\nlotus-born Brahma becomes free when he is free from Ahamkara; otherwise He\nbecomes engaged in this world affairs. When freed from this Ahamkara, all the\nJivas become free; and their houses, wealth, wives, sons and brothers are\nquite powerless to tie them down; but when bound by Ahamkara, the Jivas come\nunder their control. O king! This Ahamkara is the cause bondage to all the\nbeings; \xc2\x93I am the doer, this work is done by my power; or this I will do\nmyself\xc2\x94 thinking thus, the embodied beings fall themselves under this bondage.\nAn earthen pot cannot be made without earth; no effects can be visible without\na cause; consequently Vi _sn_ u is preserving this universe, because of this\nAhamkara (imposed on\n\n\n\np. 356\n\n\n\nhim by Prakriti). The human beings are always drowned in their cares and\nanxieties simply because they are bound by this Ahamkara; when they become\nfree from this Ahamkara, their cares and anxieties at once vanish. Moha\n(delusion) comes out of Ahamkara; world and the enjoyments thereof come out of\nMoha; otherwise how can it be accounted for, that Hari and others, the mine of\nall good and auspiciousness, take their several incarnations in various wombs?\nNeither Moha nor this world comes to those that are bereft of Ahamkara. Men\nare of three kinds, Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic; O king! Brahma, Vi _sn_ u\nand S'iva are sprung respectively from the Rajasic, Sattvic, and Tamasic\nAhamkaras. In these three, the three Ahamkaras are always to be found, so the\nMunis, that have realised the Real Essence, declare. They are all bound by\nthis Ahamkara; there is no doubt in this. The Pundits of dull intellect, and\ndeluded by Maya declare that Vi _sn_ u takes various incarnations out of his\nown free will; for when it is seen that men of even inferior intellects do not\nentertain any desire to enter into the wombs, painful and terrible; how will\nVi _sn_ u, then, the Holder of the discus, like to come into this womb! The\nslayer of Madhu, the Vai _sn_ avas say, entered all at once into the wombs of\nKaus'alya and Devaki, full of faeces and other dirty things, of His own free\nwill. But you must think out what happiness can Madhusudana, quitting his\nVaikun _t_ ha Heavens, attain in this womb, full of so many troubles, and\nwhere arise, like poisons, hundreds of cares and thoughts to torment an\nindividual! Especially when it is seen that human beings perform asceticism,\nsacrifice Yaj\xc3\xb1as and do various charities, that they would avoid thus entering\nin wombs, which is very painful and terrible. How can Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u be\ncalled independent? If so, He would never have yielded to enter into various\nwombs. Therefore, O king! Know this that this whole universe is under the\ncontrol of Yoga Maya; the Devas, men, birds, what more everything from Brahma\ndown to a blade of grass are all under the control of Yoga Maya. Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u and Hara all are bound by the rope of Her Maya. So they roam easily by\nHer Maya from womb to womb like a spider.\n\n\n\nHere ends the First Chapter of the Fifth Book on the superiority of Rudra over\nVi _sn_ u in the Maha Pura _n_ am of S'rimad Devi Bhagavatam by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa, consisting of eighteen thousand verses.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk05ch02.htm)\n\n"
