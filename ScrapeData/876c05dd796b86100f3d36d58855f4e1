In the beginning there arose the Golden Child (Hira _n_ ya-garbha\n[1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:1:1)); as soon as born, he alone was the lord of all\nthat is. He stablished the earth and this heaven:--Who is the God to whom we\nshall offer sacrifice?\n\n2\\. He who gives breath, he who gives strength, whose\n[1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:2:1) command all the bright gods revere, whose\nshadow [2](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:2:2) is immortality, whose shadow is\ndeath:--Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?\n\n3\\. He who through his might became the sole king of the breathing and\ntwinkling [1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:3:1) world, who governs all this, man and\nbeast:--Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?\n\n4\\. He through whose might [1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:4:1) these snowy\nmountains are, and the sea, they say, with the distant river (the Rasa\n[2](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:4:2)), he of whom these regions are indeed the two\narms:--Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?\n\n5\\. He through whom the awful heaven and the earth were made fast\n[1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:5:1), he through whom the ether was stablished, and\nthe firmament; he who measured the air in the sky\n[2](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:5:2):--Who is the God to whom we shall offer\nsacrifice?\n\np. 2\n\n6\\. He to whom heaven and earth [1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:6:1), standing firm\nby his will, look up, trembling in their mind; he over whom the risen sun\nshines forth:--Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?\n\n7\\. When the great waters [1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:7:1) went everywhere,\nholding the germ (Hira _n_ ya-garbha), and generating light, then there arose\nfrom them the (sole [2](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:7:2)) breath of the gods:--Who\nis the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?\n\n8\\. He who by his might looked even over the waters which held power (the\ngerm) and generated the sacrifice (light [1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:8:1)), he\nwho alone is God above all gods [2](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:8:2):--Who is the\nGod to whom we shall offer sacrifice?\n\n9\\. May he not hurt us, he who is the begetter of the earth, or he, the\nrighteous, who begat the heaven; he who also begat the bright and mighty\nwaters:--Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?\n\n[10 [1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:10:1). Pra _g_ apati, no other than thou\nembraces all these created things. May that be ours which we desire when\nsacrificing to thee: may we be lords of wealth!]\n\np. 3\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Hira _n_ yagarbha Pra _g_ apatya, and is supposed to\nbe addressed to Ka, Who, i. e. the Unknown God.\n\nFirst translated in my History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 1859, p. 569;\nsee also Hibbert Lectures; 1882, p. 301; Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, IV, p.\n15.\n\nVerse 1 = VS. XIII, 4; XXIII, 1; XXV, 10; TS. IV, 1, 8, 3; 2, 8, 2; AV. IV, 2,\n7.\n\nVerse 2 = VS. XXV, 13; TS. IV, 1, 8, 4; VII, 5, 17, 1; AV. IV, 2, I; XIII, 3,\n24.\n\nVerse 3 = VS. XXIII, 3; XXV, 11; TS. IV, 1, 8, 4; VII, 5, 16, 1; AV. IV, 2, 2.\n\nVerse 4 = VS. XXV, 12; TS. IV, 1, 8, 4; AV. IV, 2, 5.\n\nVerse 5 = VS. XXXII, 6; TS. IV, 1, 8, 5; AV. IV, 2, 4.\n\nVerse 6 = VS. XXXII, 7; TS.

XII, 102; TS. IV, 2, 7, 1.\n\nVerse 10 = VS. X, 20; XXIII, 65; TS. I, 8, 14, 2; III, 2, 5, 6; TB. II, 8, 1,\n2; III, 5, 7, 1; AV. VII, 79, 4; 80, 3.\n\nThis is one of the hymns which has always been suspected as modern by European\ninterpreters. The reason is clear. To us the conception of one God, which\npervades the whole of this hymn, seems later than the conception of many\nindividual gods, as recognised in various aspects of nature, such as the gods\nof the sky, the sun, the storms, or the fire. And in a certain sense we may be\nright, and language also confirms our sentiment. In our hymn there are several\nwords which do not occur again in the Rig-veda, or which occur in places only\nwhich have likewise been suspected to be of more modern date. Hira _n_\nyagarbha\n\np. 4\n\nitself is an \xe1\xbc\x85\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xce\xbe \xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbd. Sam avartata is found only in the last Ma _n_ _d_\nala, X, 90, 14; 129, 4. Bhuta also, in the sense of what is, occurs in the\ntenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala only. It is used three times (X, 55, 2; 58, 12; 90, 2) as\nopposed to bhavya, i. e. what is and what will be; and once more in the sense\nof all that is (X, 85, 17). \xc3\x82tmada\xc2\xb4 _h_ , in the sense of giving life, is\nanother \xe1\xbc\x85\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xce\xbe \xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbd. Pra _s_ ish is restricted to Ma _n_ _d_ alas I (I,\n145, 1), IX (IX, 66, 6; 86, 32), and our passage. Himavat, \xe1\xbc\x85\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xce\xbe \xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbd. The\nrepetition of the relative pronoun in verses 2 and 4 is unusual. In the tenth\nverse the compound yat-kama _h_ is modern, and the insertion of eta\xc2\xb4ni between\ntvat and anya _h_ is at all events exceptional. The passage V, 31, 2 is not\nparallel, because in tvat indra vasya _h_ anyat, the ablative tvat is governed\nby vasya _h_. In VI, 21, 10, na tva\xc2\xb4van anya _h_ am _ri_ ta tvat asti, anya\n_h_ is separated from tvat by a vocative only, as in VIII, 24, 11.\n\nBut when we say that a certain hymn is modern, we must carefully consider what\nwe mean. Our hymn, for instance, must have existed not only previous to the\nBrahma _n_ a period, for many Brahma _n_ as presuppose it, but previous to the\nMantra period also. It is true that no verse of it occurs in the Sama-veda,\nbut in the Sama-veda-brahma _n_ a IX, 9, 12, verse 1 at least is mentioned a.\nMost of its verses, however, occur in the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita, in the\nTaittiriya-sa _m_ hita, and in the Atharva-veda-sa _m_ hita, nay, the last\nverse, to my mind the most suspicious of all, occurs most frequently in the\nother Sa _m_ hitas and Brahma _n_ as.\n\nBut though most of the verses of our hymn occur in other Sa _m_ hitas, they do\nnot always occur in the same order.\n\nIn the Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. we have the first verse in XIII, 4, but no other\nverse of our hymn follows. We have the first verse again in XXIII, 1, but not\nfollowed by verse 2, but by verse 3 (XXIII, 3) b. Then we have verse 1 once\nmore\n\np. 5\n\nin XXV, 10, followed by verse 3 (XXV, 11), by verse 4 (XXV, 12), and then by\nverse 2 (XXV, 13).\n\nWe have verses 5, 6, 7, 8 in VS. XXXII, 6 and 7, and verses 7 and 8 in VS.\nXXVII, 25 and 26, while verse 9 is found in XII, 102 only a, and the last\nverse in X, 20 b, and XXIII, 65.\n\nIn the Taitt. Sa _m_ hita the verses follow more regularly, still never quite\nin the same order as in the Rig-veda. In TS. IV, 1, 8, 3 c we have verses 1 to\n8, but verse 3 before verse 2, and verse 6 before verse 5, while verse 9\nfollows in IV, 2, 7, 1.\n\nIn TS. v. 3 stands before v. 2, in VII, 5, 16, 1, and VII, 5, 17, 1.\n\nIn TS. II, 2, 12, the pratikas of verses 1, 7, 10 are quoted in succession.\n\nVerse 7 occurs with important various readings in TA. I, 23, 8, a\xc2\xb4po ha yad b\n_ri_ hati\xc2\xb4r garbham a\xc2\xb4yan daksha _m_ dadhana ganayanti _h_ svayambhum, tata\nime\xe0\xa4\xbddhyasri _g_ yanta sarga _h_.\n\nLastly in the AV. we find verses 1 to 7 from IV, 2, 1, to IV, 2, 7, but\narranged in a different order, viz. as 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 1, and with important\nvarious readings.\n\nVerse 2, yo\xc2\xb4 3 sye _s_ e dvipado ya _s_ _k_ atushpada _h_ , as third pada;\nalso in XIII, 3, 24.\n\nVerse 3, eko ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ a; yasya _kh_ aya\xc2\xb4m _r i_ta _m_ yasya m _ri_ tyu _h_ , as\nthird pada.\n\nVerse 4, yasya vi _s_ ve; samudre yasya rasa\xc2\xb4m id ahu _h_ ; ima\xc2\xb4 _s_ _k_ a.\n\nVerse 5, yasya dyaur urvi\xc2\xb4 p _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4 _k_ a mahi\xc2\xb4 yasyada urvamtariksham,\nyasyasau su\xc2\xb4ro vitato mahitva\xc2\xb4.\n\nVerse 6, avata _s_ _k_ askabhane bhiyasane rodasi ahvayetham (sic), yasyasau\npantha\xc2\xb4 ra _g_ aso vimana _h_.\n\nVerse 7, a\xc2\xb4po agre vi _s_ vam avan garbha _m_ dadhana am _r i_ta _ri_ ta _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a\xc2\xb4 _h_ , ya\xc2\xb4su devi\xc2\xb4shv adhi deva asit.\n\nVerse 10, vi\xc2\xb4 _s_ va rupa\xc2\xb4 _n_ i paribhur _g_ agana, see VII, 79, 4, and 80,\n3.\n\nWe are justified, therefore, in looking upon the verses, composing this hymn,\nas existing before the\n\np. 6\n\nfinal arrangement of the four Sa _m_ hitas, and if we persist in calling a\nhymn, dating from that period, a modern hymn, we must make it quite clear\nthat, according to the present state of our knowledge, such a hymn cannot well\nbe more modern than 1000 b.c. Besides the variations in the arrangement of the\nverses of our hymn, the very considerable various readings which we find in\nthe VS., TS., and AV. are highly instructive, as showing the frequent\nemployment of our hymn for sacrificial purposes. In several cases these\nvarious readings are of great importance, as we shall see.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nMuir: Hira _n_ yagarbha arose in the beginning; born, he was the one lord of\nthings existing. He established the earth and this sky: to what god shall we\noffer our oblation?\n\nLudwig: Hira _n_ yagarbha hat zuerst sich gebildet, er ward geboren als\neinziger herr alles gewordenen, dise erde and disen himel halt er; Ka, dem\ngotte, mochten wir mit havis aufwarten.\n\nNote 1. Hira _n_ yagarbha a has been translated in different ways, and it\nwould perhaps be best to keep it as a proper name, which it is in later times.\nIt means literally the golden embryo, the golden germ or child, or born of a\ngolden womb, and was no doubt an attempt at naming the sun. Soon, however,\nthat name became mythological. The golden child was supposed to have been so\ncalled because it was Pra _g_ apati, the lord of creation, when dwelling as\nyet in the golden egg, and Hira _n_ yagarbha became in the end a recognised\nname of Pra _g_ apati, see Say. on X, 121, 1. All this is fully explained by\nSaya _n_ a, TS. IV, 1, 8, 3; IV, 2, 8, 2; by Mahidhara, VS. XIII, 4.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nMuir: He who gives breath, who gives strength, whose command all, [even] the\ngods, reverence, whose shadow is immortality, whose shadow is death: to what\ngod shall we offer our oblation?\n\np. 7\n\nLudwig: Geber des lebendigen hauches, geber der kraft, zu des unterweisung\nalle Otter sich einfinden, des glanz die unsterblichkeit, dessen der tod ist,\nKa, dem gotte, mochten wir mit havis aufwarten.\n\nNote 1. In order to account for the repetition of yasya, Saya _n_ a and\nMahidhara take vi _s_ ve for men, and deva _h_ for gods.\n\nNote 2. It is difficult to say what is meant by _kh_ aya, shadow. I take it in\nthe sense of what belongs to the god, as the shadow belongs to a man, what\nfollows him, or is determined by him. In that sense Saya _n_ a also takes it,\nTS. IV, 1, 8, 4, yasya pra _g_ apate _s_ _kh_ ayavat svadhinam am _ri_ tam,\nmoksharupam, m _ri_ tyu _h_ , pra _n_ inam mara _n_ am api, yasya _kh_ ayeva\nsvadhina _h_ ; and, though not quite so clearly, in RV. X, 121, 2. Mahidhara\non the contrary takes _kh_ aya in the sense of refuge, and says, whose shadow,\ni. e. whose worship, preceded by knowledge, is am _ri_ ta, immortality, a\nmeans of deliverance a, while ignorance of him is death, or leads to sa _m_\nsara.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nMuir: Who by his might became the sole king of the breathing and winking\nworld, who is the lord of this two-footed and four-footed [creation]: to what\ngod shall we offer our oblation?\n\nLudwig: Der des atmenden, augenbewegenden lebendigen durch seine grosze der\neinzige konig geworden; der verfugt uber disz zwei- und vier-fuszige, Ka, dem\ngotte, mochten wir mit havis aufwarten.\n\nNote 1. It is difficult to say whether nimishata _h_ means twinkling or\nsleeping. It has both meanings as to wink has in English. Saya _n_ a (X, 121,\n3; TS. IV, 1, 8, 4) and Mahidhara (VS. XXIII, 3 b) explain it by winking. This\nmay be right as expressing sensuous perception, in addition to mere breathing.\nIn X, 190, 2, vi _s_ vasya mishato va _s_ i\xc2\xb4 means, lord of all that winks, i.\ne.\n\np. 8\n\nlives. The later idea, that the gods do not wink, has nothing to do with our\npassage.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nMuir: Whose greatness these snowy mountains, and the sea with the Rasa\n(river), declare,--of whom these regions, of whom they are the arms: to what\ngod shall we offer our oblation?\n\nLudwig: Dessen die schneebedeckten (berge, die Himavan) vermoge seiner grosze,\nals des eigentum man ocean und Rasa nennt, des dise himelsgegenden, des arme\nsie, Ka, dem gotte, mochten wir mit havis aufwarten.\n\nNote 1. Muir's translation, which suggests itself very naturally to a European\nmind, is impossible, because mahitva\xc2\xb4 cannot be either mahitvam (as Saya _n_ a\nalso and Mahidhara suggest), or mahitva\xc2\xb4ni; and because ahu _h_ does not mean\ndeclare. Otherwise nothing could be better than his rendering: 'Whose\ngreatness these snowy mountains, and the sea with the Rasa (river), declare.'\n\nMahitva\xc2\xb4, as Saya _n_ a also rightly perceives, TS. IV, 1, 8, 4, is a very\ncommon instrumental (see Lanman, Noun-inflection, pp. 335-6), and the same\nmahitva\xc2\xb4 must be supplied for samudra _m_. We might make the whole sentence\ndependent on ahu _h_ without much change of meaning. The Atharva-veda text\nsupplies a lectio facilior, but not therefore melior.\n\nNote 2. The Rasa is a distant river, in some respects like the Greek Okeanos.\nDr. Aufrecht takes it as a name of the milky way, Z. D. M. G. XIII, 498: see\nMuir, S. T. II, p. 373, n. 19.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nMuir: By whom the sky is fiery, and the earth fixed, by whom the firmament and\nthe heaven were established, who in the atmosphere is the measurer of the\naerial space: to what god shall we offer our oblation?\n\nLudwig: Durch den gewaltig der himel and fest die erde, durch den gestutzt\nSvar, and das gewolbe, der die raume im mittelgebiete ausgemeszen, Ka, dem\ngotte, mochten wir mit havis aufwarten.\n\np. 9\n\nNote 1. In this verse I decidedly prefer the reading of the Atharva-veda, yena\ndyaur ugra p _ri_ thivi ka d _ri_ _lh_ e. It seems not a lectio facilior, and\nwe avoid the statement that the heaven has been made ugra. Ugra, as applied to\ndyaus, means awful and grand, as an inherent quality rather, and not simply\nstrong. See Ludwig, Notes, p. 441.\n\nNote 2. Ra _g_ aso vima\xc2\xb4na _h_ has been fully discussed by Muir, S. T. IV, p.\n71, but it is difficult to find a right translation for it, because the\ncosmography of the Veda is so different from our own (see I, 6, 9, note 1, and\nI, 19, 3, note 1). I think we may translate it here by the air, or even by\nspace, particularly the bright air in the sky, the sky (antariksha or nabhas)\nbeing between heaven (dyu) and earth (p _ri_ thivi), while sva _h_ and naka\nare still higher than the heaven (dyu), sva _h_ being sometimes explained as\nthe abode of the sun, the ether, or empyrean, naka, the firmament, as svarga\n(Mahidhara); or sva _h_ as svarga, and naka as aditya (Saya _n_ a). Vimana is\nhere simply the measurer, though vima, from meaning to measure, is apt to take\nthe meaning of to make, which is an excuse for Saya _n_ a's rendering, 'who\nmakes the rain in the sky.'\n\nThe Atharva-veda rendering is very free, and certainly no improvement.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nMuir: To whom two contending armies, sustained by his succour, looked up,\ntrembling in mind; over whom the risen sun shines: to what god shall we offer\nour oblation?\n\nLudwig: Auf den die beiden schlachtreihen durch (ihre) begirde aufgestellt in\nordnung ihren blick richten, zitternd, im geiste, wo daru\xc2\xb4ber hin aufgegangen\nSura ausstralt, Ka, dem gotte, mochten wir mit havis aufwarten.\n\nNote 1. It would be well to read rodasi for krandasi (which B. R. explain by\n'two armies'), and the various reading in AV. IV, 2, 3 decidedly points in\nthat direction. But even if krandasi stands, it must be taken in the same\nsense as rodasi. Uditau vyeti in TS. IV, 1, 8, 5 is explained by udayavishaye\nvividha _m_ ga _k_ _kh_ ati.\n\np. 10\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nMuir: When the great waters pervaded the universe containing an embryo, and\ngenerating fire, thence arose the one spirit (asu) of the gods: to what god\nshall we offer our oblation?\n\nLudwig: Als die groszen waszer kamen, die allen keim in sich faszten, zeugend\nden Agni, da kam zu Stande der gotter einziger lebensgeist; Ka, dem gotte,\nmochten wir mit havis aufwarten.\n\nNote 1. The waters here referred to have to be understood as the waters in the\nbeginning of the creation, where, as we read (RV. X, 129, 3), 'everything was\nlike a sea without a light,' or, as the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a (XI, 1, 6,\n1) says, 'everything was water and sea.' These waters held the germ a, and\nproduced the golden light, the sun b, whence arose the life of all the gods,\nviz. Pra _g_ apati. The Atharva-veda adds a verse which repeats the same idea\nmore clearly: a\xc2\xb4po vatsa _m_ _g_ anayantir garbham agre samairayan, tasyota\n_g_ a\xc2\xb4yamanasyolba asid dhira _n_ yaya _h_ , 'In the beginning the waters,\nproducing a young, brought forth an embryo, and when it was being born, it had\na golden covering.' The sunrise serves here as elsewhere as an image of the\ncreation.\n\nNote 2. Grassmann proposes to omit eka, because it is absent in the Maitraya\n_n_ i _S_ akha. The metre shows the same.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nMuir: He who through his greatness beheld the waters which contained power,\nand generated sacrifice, who was the one god above the gods: to what god shall\nwe offer our oblation?\n\nLudwig: Der in seiner grosze sogar die waszer uberschaute, wie sie die\nfahigkeit besitzend erzeugten das opfer, der der einzige gott war uber den\ngottern, Ka, dem gotte, mochten wir mit havis aufwarten.\n\nNote 1. In daksha _m_ dadhana _g_ anayantir ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am, we have a\nrepetition of what was said in the preceding verse,\n\np. 11\n\ndaksham standing for garbham, ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am for agnim, which is actually the\nreading of TS. The Atharva-veda does not contain this verse, which is used as\nan anya vikalpita ya _g_ ya in TS.\n\nNote 2. It is curious that one of the most important sentences in the Rig-\nveda, yo deveshv adhi deva eka asit, should have been changed in the Atharva-\nveda IV, 2, 6 into yasu devishv adhi deva asit, 'over which divine waters\nthere was the god.' See Ludwig, Notes, p. 441.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nMuir: May he not injure us, he who is the generator of the earth, who, ruling\nby fixed ordinances, produced the heavens, who produced the great and\nbrilliant waters: to what god shall we offer our oblation?\n\nLudwig: Nicht schadige uns, der der erde erzeuger, oder der den himel bereitet\nmit warhafter satzung, der auch die wasser, die hellen, die machtigen erzeugt\nhat, Ka, dem gotte, mochten wir mit havis aufwarten.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nMuir: Pra _g_ apati, no other than thou is lord over all these created things:\nmay we obtain that, through desire of which we have invoked thee: may we\nbecome masters of riches.\n\nLudwig: Pra _g_ apati, kein anderer als du hat umfasst die wesen alle, der\nwunsch, um deswillen wir dir opfern, der werde uns zu teil, besitzer von\nreichtumern mogen wir sein.\n\nNote 1. This verse is certainly extremely weak after all that preceded, still,\nto judge from its frequent occurrence, we cannot well discard it. All we can\nsay is that nowhere, except in the Rig-veda, does it form the final verse of\nour hymn, and thus spoil its whole character.\n\nThat character consists chiefly in the burden of the nine verses, Kasmai\ndevaya havisha vidhema, 'To what god shall we offer sacrifice?' This is\nclearly meant to express a desire of finding out the true, but unknown god,\nand to do so, even after all has been said that can be said of a supreme god.\nTo finish such a hymn with a statement\n\np. 12\n\nthat Pra _g_ apati is the god who deserves our sacrifice, may be very natural\ntheologically, but it is entirely uncalled for poetically. The very phrase\nKasmai devaya havisha vidhema must have been a familiar phrase, for we find in\na hymn-addressed to the wind, X, 168, 4, after all has been said that can be\nsaid of him, the concluding line: ghosha _h_ it asya _s_ _ri_ _n_ vire na\nrupam tasmai va\xc2\xb4taya havisha vidhema, 'his sound indeed is heard, but he is\nnot seen--to that Vata let us offer sacrifice.'\n\nBut more than this, on the strength of hymns like our own in which the\ninterrogative pronoun ka, 'who,' occurs, the Brahmans actually invented a god\nof the name of Ka. I pointed this out many years ago in my History of Ancient\nSanskrit Literature (1860, p. 433), where I said: In accordance with the same\nsystem, we find that the authors of the Brahma _n_ as had so completely broken\nwith the past that, forgetful of the poetical character of the hymns, and the\nyearning of the poets after the unknown god, they exalted the interrogative\npronoun into a deity,' and acknowledged a god 'Ka, or Who.' In the Taittiriya-\nsa _m_ hita (I, 7, 6, 6), in the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a (XXIV, 4), in the Ta\n_n_ _d_ ya-brahma _n_ a (XV, 10), and in the Satapatha-brahma _n_ a a,\nwhenever interrogative verses occur, the author states, that Ka is Pra _g_\napati, or 'the Lord of Creatures' (Pra _g_ apatir vai Ka _h_ ). Nor did they\nstop there. Some of the hymns in which the interrogative pronoun occurred were\ncalled Kadvat, i. e. having kad or quid. But soon a new adjective was formed,\nand not only the hymns, but the sacrifices also, offered to the god, were\ncalled Kaya, or who-ish b. This word, which is not to be identified with the\nLatin cujus, cuja, cujum, but is merely the artificial product of an effete\nmind, is found in the Taittiriya-sa _m_ hita (I, 8, 3, 1), and in the Va _g_\nasaneyi-sa _m_ hita (XXIV, 15). At the time of Pa _n_ ini\n\np. 13\n\nthis word had acquired such legitimacy as to call for a separate rule\nexplaining its formation (Pa _n_. IV, 2, 25). The commentator there explains\nKa by Brahman. After this we can hardly wonder that in the later Sanskrit\nliterature of the Pura _n_ as, Ka appears as a recognised god, as the supreme\ngod, with a genealogy of his own, perhaps even with a wife; and that in the\nLaws of Manu, one of the recognised forms of marriage, generally known by the\nname of Pra _g_ apati-marriage, occurs under the monstrous title of 'Kaya.'\nStranger still, grammarians who know that ka forms the dative kasmai only if\nit is an interrogative pronoun, consider kasmai in our hymn as irregular,\nbecause, as a proper name, Ka ought to form the dative Kaya.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[4:a](sbe3215.htm#fr_76) The last line is here, tasmai ta indo havisha\nvidhema, let us sacrifice to him with thy oblation, O Soma!\n\n[4:b](sbe3215.htm#fr_77) Var. lect. nimeshata _h_.\n\n[5:a](sbe3215.htm#fr_78) Var. lect. ma\xc2\xb4 ma, satyadharma vya\xc2\xb4na _t_ , prathamo\nfor b _ri_ hati\xc2\xb4h.\n\n[5:b](sbe3215.htm#fr_79) Var. lect., rupa\xc2\xb4ni for bhuta\xc2\xb4ni.\n\n[5:c](sbe3215.htm#fr_80) Var. lect., ver. 5, d _ri_ _dh_ e, dual for d _ri_\n_lh_ a\xc2\xb4; ver. 6, uditau vyeti for udito vibha\xc2\xb4ti; ver. 8, agnim for ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nam.\n\n[6:a](sbe3215.htm#fr_81) M.
