Verily, Pra _g_ apati, the year, is Agni, and King Soma, the moon.\nHe himself, indeed, proclaimed (taught) his own self to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ava _k_ as\nRa _g_ astambayana, saying, 'As many lights as there are of mine, so many are\nmy bricks.'\n\n10:4:2:22\\. Now in this Pra _g_ apati, the year, there are seven hundred and\ntwenty days and nights, his lights, (being) those bricks; three hundred and\nsixty\n\np. 350\n\nenclosing-stones 1, and three hundred and sixty bricks with (special)\nformulas. This Pra _g_ apati, the year, has created all existing things, both\nwhat breathes and the breathless, both gods and men. Having created all\nexisting things, he felt like one emptied out, and was afraid of death.\n\n10:4:2:33\\. He bethought himself, 'How can I get these beings back into my\nbody? how can I put them back into my body? how can I be again the body of all\nthese beings?'\n\n10:4:2:44\\. He divided his body into two; there were three hundred and sixty\nbricks in the one, and as many in the other: he did trot succeed 2.\n\n10:4:2:55\\. He made himself three bodies,--in each of them there were three\neighties of bricks I he did not succeed.\n\n10:4:2:66\\. He made himself four bodies of a hundred and eighty bricks each:\nhe did not succeed.\n\n10:4:2:77\\. He made himself five bodies,--in each of them there were a hundred\nand forty-four bricks: he did not succeed.\n\n10:4:2:88\\. He made himself six bodies of a hundred and twenty bricks each: he\ndid not succeed. He did not develop himself sevenfold 3.\n\n10:4:2:99\\. He made himself eight bodies of ninety bricks each: he did not\nsucceed.\n\n10:4:2:1010\\. He made himself nine bodies of eighty bricks each: he did not\nsucceed.\n\np. 351\n\n10:4:2:1111\\. He made himself ten bodies of seventy-two bricks each: he did\nnot succeed. He did not develop elevenfold.\n\n10:4:2:1212\\. He made himself twelve bodies of sixty bricks each: he did not\nsucceed. He did not develop either thirteenfold or fourteenfold.\n\n10:4:2:1313\\. He made himself fifteen bodies of forty-eight bricks each: he\ndid not succeed.\n\n10:4:2:1414\\. He made himself sixteen bodies of forty-five bricks each: he did\nnot succeed. He did not develop seventeenfold.\n\n10:4:2:1515\\. He made himself eighteen bodies of forty bricks each: he did not\nsucceed. He did not develop nineteenfold.\n\n10:4:2:1616\\. He made himself twenty bodies of thirty-six bricks each: he did\nnot succeed. He did not develop either twenty-one-fold, or twenty-two-fold, or\ntwenty-three-fold.\n\n10:4:2:1717\\. He made himself twenty-four bodies of thirty bricks each. There\nhe stopped, at the fifteenth; and because he stopped at the fifteenth\narrangement 1 there are fifteen forms of the waxing, and fifteen of the waning\n(moon).\n\n10:4:2:1818\\. And because he made himself twenty-four bodies, therefore the\nyear consists of twenty-four half-months. With these twenty-four bodies of\nthirty bricks each he had not developed (sufficiently). He saw the fifteen\nparts of the day, the muhurtas 2,\n\np. 352\n\nas forms for his body, as space-fillers (Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as 1), as well as\nfifteen of the night; and inasmuch as they straightway (muhu) save (trai),\nthey are (called) 'muhurta _h_ '; and inasmuch as, whilst being small, they\nfill (pur) these worlds (or spaces, 'loka') they are (called) 'lokamp _ri_ _n_\na _h_.'\n\n10:4:2:1919\\. That one (the sun) bakes everything here, by means of the days\nand nights, the half-moons, the months, the seasons, and the year; and this\n(Agni, the fire) bakes what is baked by that one: 'A baker of the baked (he\nis),' said Bharadva _g_ a of Agni; 'for he bakes what has been baked by that\n(sun).'\n\n10:4:2:2020\\. In the year these (muhurtas) amounted to ten thousand and eight\nhundred: he stopped at the ten thousand and eight hundred.\n\n10:4:2:2121\\. He then looked round over all existing things, and beheld all\nexisting things in the threefold lore (the Veda), for therein is the body of\nall metres, of all stomas, of all vital airs, and of all the gods: this,\nindeed, exists, for it is immortal, and what is immortal exists; and this\n(contains also) that which is mortal.\n\n10:4:2:2222\\. Pra _g_ apati bethought himself, 'Truly, all existing things are\nin the threefold lore: well, then, I will construct for myself a body so as to\ncontain the whole threefold lore.'\n\n10:4:2:2323\\. He arranged the _Ri_ k-verses into twelve thousand of B _ri_\nhatis 2, for of that extent are the\n\np. 353\n\nverses created by Pra _g_ apati. At-the thirtieth arrangement they came to an\nend in the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis; and because it was at the thirtieth arrangement that they\ncame to an end, there are thirty nights in the month; and because it was in\nthe Pa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis, therefore Pra _g_ apati is 'pa\xe1\xb9\x85kta' (fivefold) 1. There are one\nhundred-and-eight hundred 2 Pa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis.\n\n10:4:2:2424\\. He then arranged the two other Vedas into twelve thousand B _ri_\nhatis,--eight (thousand) of the Ya _g_ us (formulas), and four of the Saman\n(hymns)--for of that extent is what was created by Pra _g_ apati in these two\nVedas. At the thirtieth arrangement these two came to an end in the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis;\nand because it was at the thirtieth arrangement that they came to an end,\nthere are thirty nights in the month; and because it was in the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis,\ntherefore Pra _g_ apati is 'pa\xe1\xb9\x85kta.' There were one hundred-and-eight hundred\n2 Pa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis.\n\n10:4:2:2525\\. All the three Vedas amounted to ten thousand eight hundred\neighties (of syllables) 3; muhurta by muhurta he gained a fourscore (of\nsyllables), and muhurta by muhurta a fourscore was completed 4.\n\n10:4:2:2626\\. Into these three worlds, (in the form of) the\n\np. 354\n\nfire-pan 1, he (Pra _g_ apati) poured, as seed into the womb, his own self\nmade up of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities. In the course of a\nhalf-moon the first body was made up, in a further (half-moon) the next\n(body), in a further one the next,--in a year he is made up whole and\ncomplete.\n\n10:4:2:2727\\. Whenever he laid down an enclosing-stone 2, he laid down a\nnight, and along with that fifteen muhurtas, and along with the muhurtas\nfifteen eighties (of syllables of the sacred texts) 3. And whenever he laid\ndown a brick with a formula (ya _g_ ushmati), he laid down a day 4, and along\nwith that fifteen muhurtas, and along with the muhurtas fifteen eighties (of\nsyllables). In this manner he put this threefold lore into his own self, and\nmade it his own; and in this very (performance) he became the body of all\nexisting things, (a body) composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and\ndeities; and having become composed of all that, he ascended upwards; and he\nwho thus ascended is that moon yonder.\n\n10:4:2:2828\\. He who shines yonder (the sun) is his foundation,\n\np. 355\n\n[paragraph continues] (for) over him he was built up 1, on him he was built\nup: from out of his own self he thus fashioned him, from out of his own self\nhe generated him.\n\n10:4:2:2929\\. Now when he (the Sacrificer), being about to build an altar,\nundergoes the initiation-rite,--even as Pra _g_ apati poured his own self, as\nseed, into the fire-pan as the womb,--so does he pour into the fire-pan, as\nseed into the womb, his own self composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs,\nand deities. In the course of a half-moon, his first body is made up, in a\nfurther (half-moon) the next (body), in a further one the next,--in a year he\nis made up whole and complete.\n\n10:4:2:3030\\. And whenever he lays down an enclosing-stone, he lays down a\nnight, and along with that fifteen muhurtas, and along with the muhurtas\nfifteen eighties (of syllables). And whenever he lays down a Ya _g_ ushmati\n(brick), he lays down a day, and along with that fifteen muhurtas, and along\nwith the muhurtas fifteen eighties (of syllables of the sacred texts). In this\nmanner he puts this threefold lore into his own self, and makes it his own;\nand in this very (performance) he becomes the body of all existing things, (a\nbody) composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities; and having\nbecome composed of all that, he ascends upwards.\n\n10:4:2:3131\\. And he who shines yonder is his foundation, for over him he is\nbuilt up, on him he is built up: from out of his own self he thus fashions\nhim, from out of his own self he generates him. And when\n\np. 356\n\nhe who knows this departs from this world, then he passes into that body\ncomposed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities; and verily having\nbecome composed of all that, he who, knowing this performs this sacrificial\nwork, or he who even knows it, ascends upwards.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[350:1](sbe4362.htm#fr_690) See [X, 4, 2, 27](sbe4362.htm#10:4:2:27) with\nnote.\n\n[350:2](sbe4362.htm#fr_691) Na vyapnot, intrans., 'he did not attain (his\nobject),' cf. vyapti, in the sense of 'success';--(svaya _m_ tesham atma\nbhavitum) asamartho\xe0\xa4\xbdbhavat.

I do not see how any division of the 'muhurta'\nitself into eighty parts (as supposed by Professor Weber, Ind. Streifen, I, p.\n92, note 1) can be implied here.\n\n[354:1](sbe4362.htm#fr_702) On the construction of the Ukha, as representing\nthe universe, see VI, 5, 2 seq.\n\n[354:2](sbe4362.htm#fr_703) The number of 'pari _s_ rits' by which the great\naltar is enclosed is only 261; but to these are usually added those of the\nother brick-built hearths, viz. the Garhapatya (21) and the eight Dhish _n_\nyas (78),--the whole amounting to 360 enclosing-stones, or one for each day\n(or night) in the year.\n\n[354:3](sbe4362.htm#fr_704) According to [paragraph\n25](sbe4362.htm#10:4:2:25), a fourscore of syllables was completed in each\nmuhurta; and day and night consist of fifteen muhurtas each.\n\n[354:4](sbe4362.htm#fr_705) See [IX, 4, 3, 6](sbe4341.htm#9:4:3:6), where the\nnumber of Ya _g_ ushmati bricks is said to be equal to that of the pari _s_\nrits, or enclosing-stones--with, however, 35 (36) added for the intercalary\nmonth, hence altogether 395 (396); cf. [X, 4, 3,\n14](sbe4363.htm#10:4:3:14)-[19](sbe4363.htm#10:4:3:19).\n\n[355:1](sbe4362.htm#fr_706) Viz. inasmuch as the round gold plate,\nrepresenting the sun, was laid down in the centre of the altar-site, before\nthe first layer was built.
