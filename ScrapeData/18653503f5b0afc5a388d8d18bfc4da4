THE BALAR\xc4\x80MA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.\n\nAccording to some accounts of Vishnu\'s incarnations, Balar\xc4\x81ma is the _eighth;_\nKrishna in that case not being called an incarnation, but an appearance of the\ndeity himself; whilst, according to others, the two brothers together form the\neighth, Krishna having been produced from a black and Balar\xc4\x81ma from a white\nhair of Vishnu: As they were constant companions during their stay on earth,\nmany of the exploits in which Balar\xc4\x81ma shared have already been narrated in\nspeaking of Krishna. There are a few legends, * however, referring chiefly to\nBalar\xc4\x81ma.\n\np. 221\n\nBalar\xc4\x81ma is an incarnation of the serpent Sesha, * who himself was part of\nVishnu, and thus is said to be "a part of a part" of that deity. When appealed\nto by the\n\n[![BALAR\xc4\x80MA.](tn/22100.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/22100.jpg)  \nBALAR\xc4\x80MA.  \n\ndistressed gods to appear on earth to save them from their oppressor Kansa,\nVishnu, a year before his own birth, transferred by means of Yoganindra, the\nembryo\n\np. 222\n\nof Balar\xc4\x81ma from Devaki to Rohini, another wife of Vasudeva, residing at\nGokula, to save it from the cruel anger of Kansa, who had ordered the\ndestruction of Devaki\'s children as soon as they were born. When about a year\nold, this child was placed under the care of a herdsman named Nanda and his\nwife Yasoda, the reputed parents of Krishna, that the two boys might be\nbrought up together; Vasudeva, on the night of Krishna\'s birth, having carried\nhim to the house of Nanda, and substituted him for the infant daughter of\nthese people.\n\nBalar\xc4\x81ma was second only to Krishna in the possession of miraculous powers.\nOne day, as he was with the young cow-keepers in a wood, his companions asked\nhim to shake some fruit trees belonging to a demon called Dhenuka, that they\nmight enjoy the fruit. As he was complying with their request, the demon, in\nthe form of a monster ass, appeared. As he tried to kick Balar\xc4\x81ma, the hero\nseized him by his hind legs, swung him round his head, and threw him to the\nground with such force that he died immediately: the dead body Balar\xc4\x81ma threw\nto the top of a palm tree, and the demon\'s relatives who came to his rescue\nreceived similar treatment at his hands. After Dhenuka\'s death, his orchard\nbecame a favourite spot of the cowherds. Whilst they were playing there, a\ndemon named Pralamba came in the form of a boy, and joining them in their\ngame, persuaded Balar\xc4\x81ma to get up on his shoulders. No sooner had he mounted\nthan the demon ran off with him, and, feeling the hero to be heavy, he\nincreased his bulk until he became like a mountain in size, causing Balar\xc4\x81ma\nto tremble with fear, and to call upon Krishna for help. Krishna reminding him\nof his divine nature says, "Calling to memory who thou art, O being of\nillimitable might, destroy the demon yourself. Suspending\n\np. 223\n\nawhile your mortal character, do what is right." Balar\xc4\x81ma acting upon this\nadvice, squeezed the demon with his knees, and pommelled him with his fists so\nfiercely that he fell down dead. When boxing with Kansa\'s wrestler in the\nlists at Mathura he easily managed to slay his antagonist.\n\nAfter Balar\xc4\x81ma had dwelt for some time in Dwaraka, a city Krishna had provided\nfor the safety of the people of Mathura, Krishna sent him to Vraja to see\ntheir old friends the herdsmen, with whom they had been brought up as boys.\nDuring his stay there, Varuna, addressing Varuni his wife, said, "Thou,\nMadira, art ever acceptable to the powerful Ananta (Sesha); go therefore and\npromote his enjoyments." Thus ordered by her husband, she took up her abode in\na Kadamba tree in the forest of Vrind\xc4\x81vana. Balar\xc4\x81ma, in his walks smelling\nthe pleasant fragrance of the liquor produced from that tree, resumed his\nancient passion for strong drink. Whilst in a state of intoxication caused by\nthis juice he ordered the river Yamuna to come to him that he might bathe in\nher. As she refused, he threw his ploughshare into the stream, and dragging\nher towards him, made her follow him wherever he went, until, his anger being\nappeased, he set her free.\n\nOn his return to Dwaraka, after this visit to his friends, he married Revati,\ndaughter of King Raivata. This king wishing to obtain a suitable husband for\nhis daughter repaired to Brahm\xc4\x81 for advice, who, expatiating on the glories of\nVishnu, detained his suppliant in heaven for ages. On his return, he was\nsurprised to find that during his long absence men had deteriorated in\ngoodness, size, and strength; but following Brahm\xc4\x81\'s counsel, he went to\nDwaraka, and offered his daughter to Balar\xc4\x81ma, who accepted the offer.\nBalar\xc4\x81ma was\n\np. 224\n\nastonished at her immense height, but by the use of his ploughshare, however,\nmanaged to reduce her to a proper size. On one occasion, as Balar\xc4\x81ma and\nDevaki were together, they were greatly annoyed by a demon named Dwivida, who\nhad the power to assume various forms. He came as a monkey, and being a source\nof annoyance to gods and men, chiefly through interrupting the sacrifices, was\nfelled by a blow of Balar\xc4\x81ma\'s heavy fist.\n\nThough the brothers Krishna and Balar\xc4\x81ma were generally the best of friends,\nthere was once a most violent quarrel between them. A man named Satadhanwan\nwas suspected of stealing a most valuable jewel. * Krishna and Balar\xc4\x81ma\npursuing him, came to a part of the country where the roads were so bad that\nthe horses could not drag their chariot. Balar\xc4\x81ma therefore remained behind,\nwhilst Krishna followed the supposed thief on foot. When within reach, the\nnever-missing discus was thrown, and the man fell headless, but the gem was\nnot to be found. On Krishna\'s return to his brother without the jewel,\nBalar\xc4\x81ma, believing he had stolen it, "flew into a violent rage, and said to\nV\xc4\x81sudeva: \'Shame light upon you to be thus greedy of wealth! I acknowledge no\nbrotherhood with you. Here lies my path; go whither you please, I have done\nwith you, with Dwaraka, with all our house. It is of no use to seek to impose\non me with your perjuries." Balar\xc4\x81ma proceeded to Videha, where for three\nyears he remained the guest of King Janaka; then, his anger being appeased, he\nacknowledged that he had misjudged his brother, and returned to his home at\nDwaraka.\n\nAs the two brothers died about the same time an account of Balar\xc4\x81ma\'s end will\nbe found in the chapter descriptive of Krishna.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[220:*](hmvp27.htm#fr_214) "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," book v.\n\n[221:*](hmvp27.htm#fr_215) Sesha (the end), or Ananta (endless), the serpent\ndeity, has a thousand heads, and forms the couch on which Vishnu reposes\nduring the intervals of creation. The world is said to rest on the head of\nSesha, who stands upon a tortoise; when, therefore, the tortoise moves his\nfeet, or Sesha yawns, earthquakes result. It was this serpent that formed the\nrope at the churning of the ocean; and by fires that issue from his body the\nworld is destroyed at the end of each age, or Kalpa.
