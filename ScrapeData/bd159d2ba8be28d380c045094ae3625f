(These details) are recorded by Sm _ri_ ti with reference to the Yogins;\nand both (Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya and Yoga) are Sm _ri_ ti (only).\n\nThe rules as to dying by day and so on in order not to return are given by Sm\n_ri_ ti for the Yogins only. And those two, viz. Yoga and Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya are mere Sm\n_ri_ ti, not of scriptural character. As thus it has a different sphere of\napplication and is based on a special kind of authority, the Sm _ri_ ti rule\nas to the time of dying has no influence on knowledge based on scripture.--\nBut, an objection is raised, we have such passages as the following one,\n'Fire, light, the day, the light half of the month, the six months of the\nnorthern progress; smoke, night, the dark half of the month, the six months of\nthe southern progress' (Bha. Gita VIII, 24; 25); in which though belonging to\nSm _ri_ ti we recognise the path of the gods and the path of the fathers just\nas determined by scripture!--Our refutation, we reply, of the claims of Sm\n_ri_ ti applies only to the contradiction which may arise from the teaching of\nSm _ri_ ti regarding the legitimate time of dying. 'I will tell you the time,'\n&c. In so far as Sm _ri_ ti also mentions Agni and the other divinities which\nlead on the departed soul, there is no contradiction whatever.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 1](sbe38302.htm)\n\n"
