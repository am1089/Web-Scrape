A lighting up of the point of the abode of that; having the door\nilluminated by that (the soul), owing to the power of its knowledge and the\napplication of remembrance of the way which is an element of that (viz. of\nknowledge), being assisted by him who abides within the heart, (passes out) by\nway of the hundred and first artery.\n\nSo far it has been shown that, up to the beginning of the journey, the souls\nof them as well who possess true knowledge as of those who do not, pass out of\nthe body in the same way. Now a difference is stated in the case of those who\nhave true knowledge. We have on this point the following text: 'There are a\nhundred and one arteries of the heart; one of them penetrates the crown of the\nhead; moving upwards by that a man reaches immortality; the others serve for\ndeparting in different directions' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 5). The doubt here\narises whether he who knows departs by this hundred and first artery in the\ntop of the head, while those who do not know depart by way of the other\narteries; or whether there is no definite rule on this point.--There is no\ndefinite rule, the Purvapakshin holds. For as the arteries are many and\nexceedingly minute, they are difficult to distinguish, and the soul therefore\nis not able to follow any particular one. The text therefore (is not meant to\nmake an original authoritative statement as to different arteries being\nfollowed by\n\np. 739\n\ndifferent souls, but) merely refers in an informal way to what is already\nsettled (viz. by the reason of the thing), i.e. the casual departure of any\nsoul by any artery.--This view the Sutra rejects 'By way of the hundred and\nfirst.' The soul of him who possesses true knowledge departs only by way of\nthe hundred and first artery in the crown of the head. Nor is that soul unable\nto distinguish that particular artcry. For, through the power of his supremely\nclear knowledge which has the effect of pleasing the Supreme Person, and\nthrough the application of remembrance of the way--which remembrance is a part\nof that knowledge--the soul of him who knows wins the favour of the Supreme\nPerson who abides within the heart, and is assisted by him. Owing to this the\nabode of that, i.e. the heart which is the abode of the soul, is illuminated,\nlit up at its tip, and thus, through the grace of the Supreme Soul, the\nindividual soul has the door (of egress from the body) lit up and is able to\nrecognise that artery. There is thus no objection to the view that the soul of\nhim who knows passes out by way of that particular artery only.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the abode of that.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 17.
