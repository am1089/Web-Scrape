In the numberless odes, sonnets, and acrostics addressed to her by a\nhundred Pandits and poets her charms were sung with prodigious triteness. Her\npresence was compared to light shining in a dark house; her face to the full\nmoon; her complexion to the yellow champaka flower; her curls to female\nsnakes; her eyes to those of the deer; her eyebrows to bent bows; her teeth to\nstrings of little opals; her feet to rubies and red gems,[153] and her gait to\nthat of the wild goose. And none forgot to say that her voice affected the\nauthor like the song of the kokila bird, sounding from the shadowy brake, when\nthe breeze blows coolly, or that the fairy beings of Indra\'s heaven would have\nshrunk away abashed at her loveliness.\n\nBut, Raja Vikram! all the poets failed to win the fair Unmadini\'s love. To\npraise the beauty of a beauty is not to praise her. Extol her wit and talents,\nwhich has the zest of novelty, then you may succeed. For the same reason, read\ninversely, the plainer and cleverer is the bosom you would fire, the more\npersonal you must be upon the subject of its grace and loveliness. Flattery\nyou know, is ever the match which kindles the Flame of love. True it is that\nsome by roughness of demeanour and bluntness in speech, contrasting with those\nwhom they call the "herd," have the art to succeed in the service of the\nbodyless god.[154] But even they must--\n\nThe young prince Dharma Dhwaj could not help laughing at the thought of how\nthis must sound in his father\'s ear. And the Raja hearing the ill-timed\nmerriment, sternly ordered the Baital to cease his immoralities and to\ncontinue his story.\n\nThus the lovely Unmadini, conceiving an extreme contempt for poets and\nliterati, one day told her father who greatly loved her, that her husband must\nbe a fine young man who never wrote verses. Withal she insisted strongly on\nmental qualities and science, being a person of moderate mind and an adorer of\ntalent--when not perverted to poetry.\n\nAs you may imagine, Raja Vikram, all the beauty\'s bosom friends, seeing her\nrefuse so many good offers, confidently predicted that she would pass through\nthe jungle and content herself with a bad stick, or that she would lead ring-\ntailed apes in Patala.\n\nAt length when some time had elapsed, four suitors appeared from four\ndifferent countries, all of them claiming equal excellence in youth and\nbeauty, strength and understanding. And after paying their respects to\nHaridas, and telling him their wishes, they were directed to come early on the\nnext morning and to enter upon the first ordeal--an intellectual conversation.\n\nThis they did.\n\n"Foolish the man," quoth the young Mahasani, "that seeks permanence in this\nworld--frail as the stem of the plantain-tree, transient as the ocean foam.\n\n"All that is high shall presently fall; all that is low must finally perish.\n\n"Unwillingly do the manes of the dead taste the tears shed by their kinsmen:\nthen wail not, but perform the funeral obsequies with diligence."\n\n"What ill-omened fellow is this?" quoth the fair Unmadini, who was sitting\nbehind her curtain;" besides, he has dared to quote poetry! "There was little\nchance of success for that suitor.\n\n"She is called a good woman, and a woman of pure descent," quoth the second\nsuitor, "who serves him to whom her father and mother have given her; and it\nis written in the scriptures that a woman who in the lifetime of her husband,\nbecoming a devotee, engages in fasting, and in austere devotion, shortens his\ndays, and hereafter falls into the fire. For it is said--\n\n"A woman\'s bliss is found not in the smile Of father, mother, friend, nor in\nherself; Her husband is her only portion here, Her heaven hereafter."\n\nThe word "serve," which might mean "obey," was peculiarly disagreeable to the\nfair one\'s ears, and she did not admire the check so soon placed upon her\ndevotion, or the decided language and manner of the youth. She therefore\nmentally resolved never again to see that person, whom she determined to be\nstupid as an elephant.\n\n"A mother," said Gunakar, the third candidate, "protects her son in babyhood,\nand a father when his offspring is growing up. But the man of warrior descent\ndefends his brethren at all times. Such is the custom of the world, and such\nis my state. I dwell on the heads of the strong!"\n\nTherefore those assembled together looked with great respect upon the man of\nvelour.\n\nDevasharma, the fourth suitor, contented himself with listening to the others,\nwho fancied that he was overawed by their cleverness. And when it came to his\nturn he simply remarked, "Silence is better than speech." Being further\npressed, he said, "A wise man will not proclaim his age, nor a deception\npracticed upon himself, nor his riches, nor the loss of riches, nor family\nfaults, nor incantations, nor conjugal love, nor medicinal prescriptions, nor\nreligious duties, nor gifts, nor reproach, nor the infidelity of his wife."\n\nThus ended the first trial. The master of the house dismissed the two former\nspeakers, with many polite expressions and some trifling presents. Then having\ngiven betel to them, scented their garments with attar, and sprinkled rose-\nwater over their heads, he accompanied them to the door, showing much regret.\nThe two latter speakers he begged to come on the next day.\n\nGunakar and Devasharma did not fail. When they entered the assembly-room and\ntook the seats pointed out to them, the father said, "Be ye pleased to explain\nand make manifest the effects of your mental qualities. So shall I judge of\nthem."\n\n"I have made," said Gunakar, "a four-wheeled carriage, in which the power\nresides to carry you in a moment wherever you may purpose to go."\n\n"I have such power over the angel of death," said Devasharma, "that I can at\nall times raise a corpse, and enable my friends to do the same."\n\nNow tell me by thy brains, O warrior King Vikram, which of these two youths\nwas the fitter husband for the maid?\n\nEither the Raja could not answer the question, or perhaps he would not, being\ndetermined to break the spell which had already kept him walking to and fro\nfor so many hours. Then the Baital, who had paused to let his royal carrier\ncommit himself, seeing that the attempt had failed, proceeded without making\nany further comment.\n\nThe beautiful Unmadini was brought out, but she hung down her head and made no\nreply. Yet she took care to move both her eyes in the direction of Devasharma.\nWhereupon Haridas, quoting the proverb that "pearls string with pearls,"\nformally betrothed to him his daughter. The soldier suitor twisted the ends of\nhis mustachios into his eyes, which were red with wrath, and fumbled with his\nfingers about the hilt of his sword. But he was a man of noble birth, and\npresently his anger passed away.\n\nMahasani the poet, however, being a shameless person--and when can we be safe\nfrom such?--forced himself into the assembly and began to rage and to storm,\nand to quote proverbs in a loud tone of voice. He remarked that in this world\nwomen are a mine of grief, a poisonous root, the abode of solicitude, the\ndestroyers of resolution, the occasioners of fascination, and the plunderers\nof all virtuous qualities. From the daughter he passed to the father, and\nafter saying hard things of him as a "Maha-Brahman,"[155] who took cows and\ngold and worshipped a monkey, he fell with a sweeping censure upon all priests\nand sons of priests, more especially Devasharma. As the bystanders\nremonstrated with him, he became more violent, and when Haridas, who was a\nweak man, appeared terrified by his voice, look, and gesture, he swore a\nsolemn oath that despite all the betrothals in the world, unless Unmadini\nbecame his wife he would commit suicide, and as a demon haunt the house and\ninjure the inmates.\n\nGunakar the soldier exhorted this shameless poet to slay himself at once, and\nto go where he pleased. But as Haridas reproved the warrior for inhumanity,\nMahasani nerved by spite, love, rage, and perversity to an heroic death, drew\na noose from his bosom, rushed out of the house, and suspended himself to the\nnearest tree.\n\nAnd, true enough, as the midnight gong struck, he appeared in the form of a\ngigantic and malignant Rakshasa (fiend), dreadfully frightened the household\nof Haridas, and carried off the lovely Unmadini, leaving word that she was to\nhe found on the topmost peak of Himalaya.\n\nThe unhappy father hastened to the house where Devasharma lived. There,\nweeping bitterly and wringing his hands in despair, he told the terrible tale,\nand besought his intended son-in-law to be up and doing.\n\nThe young Brahman at once sought his late rival, and asked his aid. This the\nsoldier granted at once, although he had been nettled at being conquered in\nlove by a priestling.\n\nThe carriage was at once made ready, and the suitors set out, bidding the\nfather be of good cheer, and that before sunset he should embrace his\ndaughter. They then entered the vehicle; Gunakar with cabalistic words caused\nit to rise high in the air, and Devasharma put to flight the demon by reciting\nthe sacred verse,[156] "Let us meditate on the supreme splendour (or adorable\nlight) of that Divine Ruler (the sun) who may illuminate our understandings.\nVenerable men, guided by the intelligence, salute the divine sun (Sarvitri)\nwith oblations and praise. Om!"\n\nThen they returned with the girl to the house, and Haridas blessed them,\npraising the sun aloud in the joy of his heart. Lest other accidents might\nhappen, he chose an auspicious planetary conjunction, and at a fortunate\nmoment rubbed turmeric upon his daughter\'s hands.\n\nThe wedding was splendid, and broke the hearts of twenty-four rivals. In due\ntime Devasharma asked leave from his father-in-law to revisit his home, and to\ncarry with him his bride. This request being granted, he set out accompanied\nby Gunakar the soldier, who swore not to leave the couple before seeing them\nsafe under their own roof-tree.\n\nIt so happened that their road lay over the summits of the wild Vindhya hills,\nwhere dangers of all kinds are as thick as shells upon the shore of the deep.\nHere were rocks and jagged precipices making the traveller\'s brain whirl when\nhe looked into them. There impetuous torrents roared and flashed down their\nbeds of black stone, threatening destruction to those who would cross them.\nNow the path was lost in the matted thorny underwood and the pitchy shades of\nthe jungle, deep and dark as the valley of death. Then the thunder-cloud\nlicked the earth with its fiery tongue, and its voice shook the crags and\nfilled their hollow caves. At times, the sun was so hot, that wild birds fell\ndead from the air. And at every moment the wayfarers heard the trumpeting of\ngiant elephants, the fierce howling of the tiger, the grisly laugh of the foul\nhyaena, and the whimpering of the wild dogs as they coursed by on the tracks\nof their prey.\n\nYet, sustained by the five-armed god[157] the little party passed safely\nthrough all these dangers. They had almost emerged from the damp glooms of the\nforest into the open plains which skirt the southern base of the hills, when\none night the fair Unmadini saw a terrible vision.\n\nShe beheld herself wading through a sluggish pool of muddy water, which\nrippled, curdling as she stepped into it, and which, as she advanced, darkened\nwith the slime raised by her feet. She was bearing in her arms the semblance\nof a sick child, which struggled convulsively and filled the air with dismal\nwails. These cries seemed to be answered by a multitude of other children,\nsome bloated like toads, others mere skeletons lying upon the bank, or\nfloating upon the thick brown waters of the pond. And all seemed to address\ntheir cries to her, as if she were the cause of their weeping; nor could all\nher efforts quiet or console them for a moment.\n\nWhen the bride awoke, she related all the particulars of her ill-omened vision\nto her husband; and the latter, after a short pause, informed her and his\nfriend that a terrible calamity was about to befall them. He then drew from\nhis travelling wallet a skein of thread. This he divided into three parts, one\nfor each, and told his companions that in case of grievous bodily injury, the\nbit of thread wound round the wounded part would instantly make it whole.\nAfter which he taught them the Mantra,[158] or mystical word by which the\nlives of men are restored to their bodies, even when they have taken their\nallotted places amongst the stars, and which for evident reasons I do not want\nto repeat. It concluded, however, with the three Vyahritis, or sacred\nsyllables--Bhuh, Bhuvah, Svar!\n\nRaja Vikram was perhaps a little disappointed by this declaration. He made no\nremark, however, and the Baital thus pursued:\n\nAs Devasharma foretold, an accident of a terrible nature did occur. On the\nevening of that day, as they emerged upon the plain, they were attacked by the\nKiratas, or savage tribes of the mountain.[159] A small, black, wiry figure,\narmed with a bow and little cane arrows, stood in their way, signifying by\ngestures that they must halt and lay down their arms. As they continued to\nadvance, he began to speak with a shrill chattering, like the note of an\naffrighted bird, his restless red eyes glared with rage, and he waved his\nweapon furiously round his head. Then from the rocks and thickets on both\nsides of the path poured a shower of shafts upon the three strangers.\n\nThe unequal combat did not last long. Gunakar, the soldier, wielded his strong\nright arm with fatal effect and struck down some threescore of the foes. But\nnew swarms came on like angry hornets buzzing round the destroyer of their\nnests. And when he fell, Devasharma, who had left him for a moment to hide his\nbeautiful wife in the hollow of a tree, returned, and stood fighting over the\nbody of his friend till he also, overpowered by numbers, was thrown to the\nground. Then the wild men, drawing their knives, cut off the heads of their\nhelpless enemies, stripped their bodies of all their ornaments, and departed,\nleaving the woman unharmed for good luck.\n\nWhen Unmadini, who had been more dead than alive during the affray, found\nsilence succeed to the horrid din of shrieks and shouts, she ventured to creep\nout of her refuge in the hollow tree. And what does she behold? her husband\nand his friend are lying upon the ground, with their heads at a short distance\nfrom their bodies. She sat down and wept bitterly.\n\nPresently, remembering the lesson which she had learned that very morning, she\ndrew forth from her bosom the bit of thread and proceeded to use it. She\napproached the heads to the bodies, and tied some of the magic string round\neach neck. But the shades of evening were fast deepening, and in her\nagitation, confusion and terror, she made a curious mistake by applying the\nheads to the wrong trunks. After which, she again sat down, and having recited\nher prayers, she pronounced, as her husband had taught her, the life-giving\nincantation.\n\nIn a moment the dead men were made alive. They opened their eyes, shook\nthemselves, sat up and handled their limbs as if to feel that all was right.\nBut something or other appeared to them all wrong. They placed their palms\nupon their foreheads, and looked downwards, and started to their feet and\nbegan to stare at their hands and legs. Upon which they scrutinized the very\nscanty articles of dress which the wild men had left upon them, and lastly one\nbegan to eye the other with curious puzzled looks.\n\nThe wife, attributing their gestures to the confusion which one might expect\nto find in the brains of men who have just undergone so great a trial as\namputation of the head must be, stood before them for a moment or two. She\nthen with a cry of gladness flew to the bosom of the individual who was, as\nshe supposed, her husband. He repulsed her, telling her that she was mistaken.\nThen, blushing deeply in spite of her other emotions, she threw both her\nbeautiful arms round the neck of the person who must be, she naturally\nconcluded, the right man. To her utter confusion, he also shrank back from her\nembrace.\n\nThen a horrid thought flashed across her mind: she perceived her fatal\nmistake, and her heart almost ceased to beat.\n\n"This is thy wife!" cried the Brahman\'s head that had been fastened to the\nsoldier\'s body.\n\n"No; she is thy wife!" replied the soldier\'s head which had been placed upon\nthe Brahman\'s body.\n\n"Then she is my wife!" rejoined the first compound creature.\n\n"By no means! she is my wife," cried the second.\n\n"What then am I?" asked Devasharma-Gunakar.\n\n"What do you think I am?" answered GunakarDevasharma, with another question.\n\n"Unmadini shall be mine," quoth the head.\n\n"You lie, she shall be mine," shouted the body.\n\n"Holy Yama,[160] hear the villain," exclaimed both of them at the same moment.\n\n* * * * * In short, having thus begun, they continued to quarrel violently, each one declaring that the beautiful Unmadini belonged to him, and to him only. How to settle their dispute Brahma the Lord of creatures only knows. I do not, except by cutting off their heads once more, and by putting them in their proper places. And I am quite sure, O Raja Vikram! that thy wits are quite unfit to answer the question, To which of these two is the beautiful Unmadini wife? It is even said--amongst us Baitals--that when this pair of half-husbands appeared in the presence of the Just King, a terrible confusion arose, each head declaiming all the sins and peccadilloes which its body had committed, and that Yama the holy ruler himself hit his forefinger with vexation.[161]\n\nHere the young prince Dharma Dhwaj burst out laughing at the ridiculous idea\nof the wrong heads. And the warrior king, who, like single-minded fathers in\ngeneral, was ever in the idea that his son had a velleity for deriding and\notherwise vexing him, began a severe course of reproof. He reminded the prince\nof the common saying that merriment without cause degrades a man in the\nopinion of his fellows, and indulged him with a quotation extensively used by\ngrave fathers, namely, that the loud laugh bespeaks a vacant mind. After which\nhe proceeded with much pompousness to pronounce the following opinion:\n\n"It is said in the Shastras----"\n\n"Your majesty need hardly display so much erudition! Doubtless it comes from\nthe lips of Jayudeva or some other one of your Nine Gems of Science, who know\nmuch more about their songs and their stanzas than they do about their\nscriptures," insolently interrupted the Baital, who never lost an opportunity\nof carping at those reverend men.\n\n"It is said in the Shastras," continued Raja Vikram sternly, after hesitating\nwhether he should or should not administer a corporeal correction to the\nVampire, "that Mother Ganga[162] is the queen amongst rivers, and the mountain\nSumeru[163] is the monarch among mountains, and the tree Kalpavriksha[164] is\nthe king of all trees, and the head of man is the best and most excellent of\nlimbs. And thus, according to this reason, the wife belonged to him whose\nnoblest position claimed her."\n\n"The next thing your majesty will do, I suppose," continued the Baital, with a\nsneer, "is to support the opinions of the Digambara, who maintains that the\nsoul is exceedingly rarefied, confined to one place, and of equal dimensions\nwith the body, or the fancies of that worthy philosopher Jaimani, who,\nconceiving soul and mind and matter to be things purely synonymous, asserts\noutwardly and writes in his books that the brain is the organ of the mind\nwhich is acted upon by the immortal soul, but who inwardly and verily believes\nthat the brain is the mind, and consequently that the brain is the soul or\nspirit or whatever you please to call it; in fact, that soul is a natural\nfaculty of the body. A pretty doctrine, indeed, for a Brahman to hold. You\nmight as well agree with me at once that the soul of man resides, when at\nhome, either in a vein in the breast, or in the pit of his stomach, or that\nhalf of it is in a man\'s brain and the other or reasoning half is in his\nheart, an organ of his body."\n\n"What has all this string of words to do with the matter, Vampire?" asked Raja\nVikram angrily.\n\n"Only," said the demon laughing, "that in my opinion, as opposed to the\nShastras and to Raja Vikram, that the beautiful Unmadini belonged, not to the\nhead part but to the body part. Because the latter has an immortal soul in the\npit of its stomach, whereas the former is a box of bone, more or less thick,\nand contains brains which are of much the same consistence as those of a\ncalf."\n\n"Villain!" exclaimed the Raja, "does not the soul or conscious life enter the\nbody through the sagittal suture and lodge in the brain, thence to\ncontemplate, through the same opening, the divine perfections?"\n\n"I must, however, bid you farewell for the moment, O warrior king,\nSakadhipati-Vikramadityal[165]! I feel a sudden and ardent desire to change\nthis cramped position for one more natural to me."\n\nThe warrior monarch had so far committed himself that he could not prevent the\nVampire from flitting. But he lost no more time in following him than a grain\nof mustard, in its fall, stays on a cow\'s horn. And when he had thrown him\nover his shoulder, the king desired him of his own accord to begin a new tale.\n\n"O my left eyelid flutters," exclaimed the Baital in despair, "my heart\nthrobs, my sight is dim: surely now beginneth the end. It is as Vidhata hath\nwritten on my forehead--how can it be otherwise[166]? Still listen, O mighty\nRaja, whilst I recount to you a true story, and Saraswati[167] sit on my\ntongue."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vampire\'s Tenth Story.
