A pattern, drawn on the\npavement, in lines of powdered rice, with flowers arranged at regular points\nwithin it, remains for a few hours, to mark the fact that cleansing and\nworship have been performed. The joy of home finds silent expression in the\nartistic zest of the design. Wealth or poverty betrays itself, according as\nthe flowers are a bright network of neuter gourd-blossoms, a stiff little row\nof two or three white daisies, or some other offering, more or less humble, as\nthe case may be.\n\nBut everywhere we read a habit of thought, to which all things are symbolic:\nthe air upon the doorstep full of dim boding and suggestiveness as to the\nincomings and outgoings which the day shall witness; and the morning opening\nand setting wide the door an act held to be no way safe unless done by one who\nwill brood in doing it upon the divine security and benediction of her\nbeloved.\n\nSuch thought was the fashion of a very ancient world--the world in which myths\nwere born, out of which religions issued, and wherein our vague and mysterious\nideas of "luck" originated. The custom bears its age upon its brow. For\nthousands of years\n\np. 58\n\nmust Indian women have risen with the light to perform the Salutation of the\nThreshold. Thousands of years of simplicity and patience, like that of the\npeasant, like that of the grass, speak in the beautiful rite. It is this\npatience of woman that makes civilisations. It is this patience of the Indian\nwoman, with this her mingling of large power of reverie, that has made and\nmakes the Indian nationality.\n\nOn its ideal side, the life of an Indian woman is a poem of the Indian soil.\nFor all that coherence and social unity which the West has lost within the\nlast few centuries remain still in the Orient intact. Eastern life is an\norganic whole, not only as regards the connectedness of its parts amongst\nthemselves, but also in the larger matter of their common relation to place.\nEven in a city, the routine of a Hindu home is an unbroken reminiscence of the\nancestral village; orthodox life is simply rural life maintained unmodified\nunder adverse conditions.\n\nPerhaps this is nowhere more strikingly illustrated than in all that concerns\nthe place of the cow in domestic life. Journeying over the country, the eye\nlearns to look to the grazing-lands in order to gauge the prosperity of\ndistricts. For in climates which horses support with difficulty the patient\nbullock is the friend of agriculture, and without his aid the fields could not\nbe kept under the plough. * Thus the Aryan and the cow between them have made\nIndia what she is; and never does the peasant forget the fact. Five thousand\nyears of love and gratitude have been sufficient, on the other hand, to\nhumanise the quadruped; and the soft eyes of the gentle beast, as we see it in\nthis Eastern land, look out on\n\np. 59\n\nus, with a satisfied conviction of kinship and mutual, trust, for which the\nWestern barbarian is but little prepared. Its breeds and sizes are almost\ninnumerable. Benares, and the rich mercantile quarters of Northern cities,\nmaintain the lordly Siva\'s bulls, who come and go about the streets eating\nfrom what shop-front or stall they choose, entirely unmolested. The south,\nagain, possesses a kind of bullock little larger than a Newfoundland dog,\nwhich is nevertheless strong enough to draw a cart containing a couple of men;\nand perhaps there are no beasts of draught in the world finer than the Mysore\nbullocks. But almost all Indian cattle are smaller than their Western compeers\nand all are characterised by a prominent hump, in front of which the yoke is\nplaced.\n\nIt is no wonder that the life of the cow has so large a place in that scheme\nof the national wellbeing which we call Hinduism. Who has realised the ages\nthat it must have taken to stock the country with the necessary numbers--ages\nin which the destruction of one life so precious under the weight of hunger\nwould be an irredeemable crime against society? It is only natural that the\npoetry of the people should find in these animals one of its central motives;\nfor all that domestic affection which we spend on the dog and cat, making of\nsuch dumb creatures actual comrades and hearthside friends, is here lavished\non them. Even in the towns, where the stones of the courtyard are the sole\npasture, they are kept, and in the huts of the poor the room occupied by the\nmilk-giver is to the full as good as that of any of the family.\n\nWe find it difficult in the North to distinguish the natural festivals of\nfruit gathering and harvest home from purely religious rites. There is an\nexaltation of feeling and imagination, and a closeness to the powers of\nnature, in the one case as in the other, which forms a link between them. The\noccasion of\n\np. 60\n\nreceiving a new cow into a Hindu family is tinged with a like sentiment. The\nwhole household turns out to welcome the incoming member, who is decorated\nwith flowers and fed daintily as soon as she enters the gates of the dwelling,\nwhile endearments are lavished on her in the effort to make her accept the\nstrange abode as home. The psychology of this is not purely self-interested,\nas when we butter the cat\'s paws that she may never be happy at a distance\nfrom our hearth. There is a habitual, almost an instinctive, recognition in\nIndia of the fact that mind is the controlling element in life, and it has\nbecome a second nature with them to appeal directly to it. Even in the case of\nwhat we are pleased to term the lower animals, it requires no argument to show\na Hindu that the cow will maintain her health and perform all her functions\nbetter if her feeling goes with, instead of against, her new environment. The\nfact is self-evident to him. And in the ceremony of welcome, the intrusion of\nany violent thought or emotion upon the family circle would be earnestly\ndeprecated, and every effort put forth to hold the mental atmosphere in\ngentleness and calm.\n\nThis way of looking at things finds striking illustration in the education of\ngirls. For throughout a woman\'s life the cow is to be her constant companion.\nIt is important, therefore, that she be duly equipped with the knowledge of\nits management and treatment. This necessity is expressed in folk-form by the\nstatement that few families are blessed with good fortune in the three matters\nof children, of money, and of milk. Even if the home be full of the laughter\nof little voices, and if there be money enough to feed them, is not the milk\napt to turn sour or the cow to run dry? It is essential, then, to choose\nbrides for our sons who have "a lucky hand with the cow"; and to attain the\n"lucky hand" little girls are made to rise at five o\'clock in the mornings,\nand to sit for an hour or more before hers\n\np. 61\n\nhanging garlands on her neck, offering flowers at her feet, giving her\ndelectable things to eat, and repeating texts and verses full of the\nexpression of reverence and gratitude. *\n\nAnd, indeed, there is no end to the household debt. "Milk is the only food,"\nsaid a Hindu, "that is the product of love." Probably for this reason--in a\ncountry where so much thought is given to the mental effects of what is eaten\n--it is the favourite, being held, with fruit and honey, to be fit nourishment\nfor the saints. But fuel and medicine also are provided by the bovine mother.\nCowdung is held to have antiseptic and purifying properties, and to spread it\nwith her own hands, making the mud floor damp proof, and giving it the breath\never fragrant to the peasant, would be thought no more disgraceful to the\nprincess fallen upon evil days of poverty than to the humbler daughter of any\npoor but well-descended house.\n\nFrom the Punjab to Cape Comorin, evenfall--the _who is it?_ moment of Japan,\nand the _yellow dust hour_ of China--is known as the _time of cowdust_ ,\nrecalling in a word the picture of the village, and the herds driven home\nalong the lanes for the night.\n\nIt is one of the great glories of countries of the Asiatic type, ranking\nbeside their universal recognition of the sacredness of letters, that in them\nthe simple life of the commonwealth as a whole, and not the artificial and\nluxurious routine of courts, has always been regarded as the social type.\nHence in India, labour, rising into government, stands side by side with\nprayer and motherhood as the main opportunity of woman, and as her integral\ncontribution\n\np. 62\n\nto the national righteousness. The domestic necessities of pastoral, may bear\nless heavily upon her than those of peasant communities, leaving her more time\nfor the use of the needle; but in Arabia, as in India, the ideal must needs be\nfulfilled, and "Our Lady of the Moslems" * is loved for the fact that, though\nthe daughter of the Prophet, she turned the millstone with her own delicate\nhands, and toiled in frugal household ways for the good of those dependent on\nher care, almost as much as for the sweet intercession by which she named "the\nsalvation of all Mussulmans" as the dowry she would claim of God on the Day of\nJudgment.\n\nIn India, the cowhouse, the dairy, the kitchen, the granary, the chapel, with\nnumerous other offices, divide the day-long attentions of the ladies of the\nfamily. In rich old houses there will be a large cooking-room and verandah for\nthe cooks, and in addition, not one but a series of kitchens for the use of\nmother, daughters, and daughters-in-law. And the herb gardens and orchards are\naccessible only from the zenana. In all these things nothing is more\nnoticeable than the readiness and spontaneity with which work is subdivided,\nand the peaceable way in which it is carried out. This is most striking with\nregard to the preparation of food, a service into which the Indian has been\ntaught from childhood to pour a concentrated sweetness of love and\nhospitality. Perhaps there is no single institution amongst ourselves by which\nwe can convey an idea of the joy it gives the master of a household to see\nmany mouths fed at his cost, or the mistress to feel that she serves them all.\nEvery woman being a cook, and often of great skill, it was in years gone by\nconsidered as the highest compliment to receive an invitation from a\n\np. 63\n\nneighbouring family on the occasion of some important festivity, to come and\nhelp _faire la cuisine_. Even Hindu society, however, is affected by the\nideals of Western organisation, and emergency-work nowadays tends more and\nmore to be laid on the shoulders of Brahmins imported for the occasion, but\nnot regarded socially as servants, in spite of the fact that they accept a\ndaily wage.\n\nThere is thus a point of view from which the lives of Indian women may be\nconsidered as a vast co-operation of the race to perform necessary labour,\ndignifying it meanwhile by every association of refinement, tenderness, and\nself-respect. And it might also be claimed that the orthodox Hindu household\nis the only one in the world which combines a high degree of civilisation with\nthe complete elimination of any form of domestic slavery. Certainly slavery in\nAsia, under the _r egimes_ of great religious systems, has never meant what\nEurope and America have made of it. There are still living persons who were\nbought in their childhood as _Ghulams_ by Rajputni and Bengali families. These\nwere orphans. brought up and educated along with the children of the\nhousehold, but made useful in minor ways. It never occurred to any one that\nwhen the days of wage-earning arrived, the quondam master and mistress had any\nclaim whatever upon the emoluments of their dependents, yet they could not be\nheld to have done their duty until they had married and settled them in life\nappropriately. It is a curious consequence of this humanity of custom that the\nword "slave" cannot be made to sting the Asiatic consciousness, as it does the\nEuropean.\n\nAs one travels through regions not yet exhausted by famine, the signs of\nIndian peasant happiness become familiar to the eye. The mud homestead, built\non its high plinth with deep verandahs, decently thatched or tiled, and almost\nhidden in clusters of\n\np. 64\n\ncocoanut palms, bamboos, and plantains, the stretch of green with its grazing\ncows, or rice-fields and mango orchards, the unbroken dome of blue, edged off,\non the horizon, by the tremulous line of foliage where new bamboos veil some\nfresh village or farmhouse, such is the picture beloved by the Indian heart.\nEven in the distant cities, every festival-day brings back its memory; for the\njars of water, with cocoanuts for lids, and the green shoots of plantain,\nstanding against the pillars, with the garlands of mango-leaves above the\ndoorway, are the "auspicious," and therefore universal decoration.\n\nIt is her longing for this natural setting of grove, river, and meadow, that\nmakes the housewife so contented with the severe architectural form of her\nhome, bidding her seek for no irrelevant decorative detail. The Indian does\nnot live in whom the passion for nature is not conscious and profound. And the\nmarble palaces of Rajputana and the North, in which buildings are made\nbeautiful, instead of having beautiful things put into them, are directly\nrelated, through this ideal, to the peasant cottages and farmhouses of Bengal.\n\nIndeed, if we would draw the life of an Indian woman truly, it is in a long\nseries of peasant pictures that it must be outlined. Every plant, flower,\nfruit, in its own season, calls up some historic or poetic association. Under\nthe kodhumba tree, whose blossoms occur in stiff balls, like those of our\nplane, stood Krishna, playing on the flute. In the magnificent shade and\ncoolness of the bo--the tree whose leaves are so delicately poised that they\nquiver like those of our aspen, even in the stillest noon--Buddha, in the\nheart of the night, attained Nirvana. The soft sirisha flower that "can bear\nthe weight of bees, but not of humming-birds," reminds one of all exquisite\nand tender things--the lips of a woman, the heart of a child, and so on,\n\np. 65\n\n[paragraph continues] The amloki fruit is not only wholesome and delicious for\nhousehold use, making the work of preserving it an act of merit, but its very\nname is famous throughout Buddhist Asia, carrying one back to the great age\nwhen it was a constant architectural ornament. The fragrance of the mango-\nblossom is one of the five arrows of Cupid\'s bow. The custard-apple was the\nfavourite fruit of Sita.\n\nSuch are a few only of the complex associations that have in the course of\nages accumulated about the common Indian life. No home is so bare that it is\nnot beautified by this wealth of dreams, for it has long ago sunk into the\nvery structure of the language. No caste is so high, nor is any outcast so\nlow, as to be beyond its reach. It is an immense national possession, creating\nmutual sentiment and common memory, offering abundance of material also for\nthe development of individual taste and imagination, and above all acting as\nan organic and indestructible bond, to attach the Indian mind eternally to its\nown soil, and in every sense involving permanence of relation, silently and\nrigorously to exclude the foreigner.\n\nMen are of course initiated into their share of this inheritance in infancy.\nAfterwards, from their study of letters, they may return and refresh the\ndomestic folklore with a greater accuracy. But the women live always in its\natmosphere. This is the actuality against whose background their simple pious\nlives are set. And through them it maintains unabated its volume and\ncontinuity.\n\nWe see thus that the Indian organisation of life and society is coherent and\nnecessary, and that its methods and ideals, having sprung directly from the\nsoil, have a stability due to correspondence with their environment which is\ninconceivable to persons who are themselves content to be favoured members of\nmost favoured nations.\n\np. 66\n\nThe social unity, as of an individual organism, was expressed in quaint form\nin the old-time myth that Brahmins sprang from the lips of the Creator,\nwarriors from His arms, the people from His thighs, and the working classes\nfrom His feet. But the way in which physical conditions imposed themselves\nupon the Creator Himself in this process could not be recognised by early\nobservers, who had seen nothing outside their own country.\n\nThe modern student, however, educated by a wide range of geographical\nimpressions, cannot fail to be struck with another feature of the Indian\nsynthesis--its completely organic character in a territorial sense. Every\nprovince within the vast boundaries fulfils some necessary part in the\ncompleting of a nationality. No one place repeats the specialised function of\nanother. And what is true of the districts holds equally good of the people as\na whole, and the women in particular. In a national character we always find a\nsummary of the national history. Of no country is this more true than of\nIndia.\n\nThe Bengali wife worships her husband, and serves her children and her\nhousehold with all the rapt idealism of the saints. The women of Maharashtra\nare as strong and as actual as any in the West. The Rajputni queen prides\nherself on the unflinching courage of her race, that would follow her husband\neven into the funeral fire, yet will not permit a king to name his wife as\namongst his subjects. The woman of Madras struggles with agony to reach the\nspiritual pole-star, building up again and again, like some careful beaver,\nany fragment of her wall of custom that the resistless tides of the modern\nworld may attempt to break away. And the daughters of Guzerat are, like the\nwomen of merchant-peoples everywhere, soft and silken and flower-like, dainty\nand clinging as a dream.\n\nOr we may penetrate into the Moslem zenana, to\n\np. 67\n\nfind the same graceful Indian womanhood, sometimes clad in the sari, sometimes\nin the short Turkish jacket, but always the self-same gentle and beautiful\nwifehood and motherhood, measuring itself in all its doings as much against\nthe standards of religious obligation, and as little against those of fashion,\nas any of its Hindu compatriots might do.\n\nNor, amongst these strong outstanding types, is there any failure of\nindividual achievement. Brynhild herself was not more heroic than thousands of\nwhom the Rajput chronicles tell. Nay, in the supreme act of her life, the\nmystic death on the throne of flame beside the dead Sigurd, many a quiet\nlittle Bengali woman has been her peer. Joan of Arc was not more a patriot\nthan Chand Bibi, * or the wonderful Queen of Jhansi, who, in the year 1857,\nfought in person with the British troops. The children of men who saw it talk\nto this day of the form of this woman\'s father swinging on the gibbet, high\nabove the city walls, hanged there by her order for the crime of making a\ntreaty with the English, to deliver the keys into their hands. They talk, too,\nof her swift rush at the head of her troops across the drowsy midday camp, her\nlance poised to pierce, her bay mare Lakshmi straining every muscle, the whizz\nof the charge so unexpected that only here and there a dazed white soldier\ncould gather presence of mind to fire a shot at the cavalcade already passed.\nAnd old men still sing her glory with tears choking the voice.\n\nBut the Rani of Jhansi, though a queen, was no purdah woman. She was a\nMahratta, with a passion for her country, and practised from girlhood in the\nchase. She had been the real heart of the kingdom ever since her marriage, for\nher husband was only a\n\np. 68\n\nhandsome figure-head, who spent in making feeble poetry the time he might have\ngiven to rule or to his wife. Her life had been, in fact, as solitary as that\nof a mediaeval saint. And her ostensible reason for fighting was the right to\nadopt an heir. There has always indeed been a great development of the\npolitical faculty amongst Mahratta women, a development which is by no means\nlost at the present day. It is well known that, long before the time of the\nQueen of Jhansi, Sivaji owed the inspiration that led to the national\nreawakening to his mother rather than to his father.\n\nIf again we desire to hear of the woman of romance, is it not sufficient to\ncite the name of that Empress to whom the Taj Mahal was built? To Hindus as to\nMohammedans this palace of the dead is holy, for to the one as to the other it\nspeaks with silent eloquence of the perfect wife. We may dream as inadequately\nas we please of the Queen Arjmand Banu, Crown of the Palace, but two things we\ncannot forget. One is the tender thought of the woman who could detach herself\nfrom the very pains of death to assure her husband that she desired a tomb\nworthy of his love; and the other is the image of the passing of Shah Jehan,\nin the sunset-lighted balcony, with his eyes fixed on the snow-white pile at\nthe bend in the river, and his heart full of the consolation of having wrought\nfor her he loved, through the space of twenty years, a work that she had\nsurely accepted at the last. The words, "Even I, even I, am Beatrice," are not\nmore full of the triumphant close of love than this picture of the death of\nthe Mogul Emperor.\n\nYet we have to admit that to the Asiatic woman in general society does not\noffer the kingdom of beauty and charm as her sphere. The foster-mother of\nMoses, the mother of Jesus, the wife of the Prophet, Khadijah, and his\ndaughter Fatima, are the true\n\np. 69\n\nexemplars of the Moslem woman. And the ideal achievements of Hindu womanhood\nare likewise of wisdom and service and renunciation, rather than of power and\nlove. Hindu lyrics of romance are always put into the mouth of Radha the\nshepherdess, singing to Krishna; and it is interesting to note how the motive\nof each lover is placed always in the feeling of the other, and how quickly\nany departure from this canon would disgust Indian taste. Even Persian poetry,\nthe classic of the Mohammedan, is said by those who know it to have avoided in\na wonderful way the use of "he and she." "Be I the string, the note be thou!\nBe thou the body, I the life! Let none hereafter say of us that one was I,\nanother thou." Is this spoken between two lovers, or is it entirely of the\nsoul?\n\nThere is doubtless some truth in the idea that society in a military state\ntends always to seclude its women. The fact that in the aristocratic\nstrictness of retreat the Mussulmannin ranks first, the Rajputni second, and\nthe Bengali woman only third, in India, goes far to support this conclusion.\nBut the case of the Rani of Jhansi is sufficient indication that the custom is\nby no means so universal as is often stated. The lower classes move freely in\nall countries, for household work and the earning of their livelihood compel;\nand the screen is always more easily lifted for the Hindu than for the\nMohammedan. A thousand considerations intervene to mitigate its severity in\nthe case of the former, while in the South and West, where Moslem rule was\nbrief, and Moslem fashions had little force, it is actually non-existent.\n\nBy this it is not to be understood that any Hindu women meet men outside their\nkindred with the freedom and frankness of their Western sisters. Very old\nadaptations of the Ramayana show us the brother-in-law who has never looked\nhigher than\n\np. 70\n\nthe heroine\'s feet, and the wife who blushes rather than mention her husband\'s\nname. But the power of the individual to isolate himself in the midst of\napparently unrestrained social intercourse is necessary in all communities,\nand has its correspondence in Western society itself. Freedom is granted only\nto the self-disciplined. It might be added that a good wife has as little\noccasion to realise the possible jealousy of her husband in the East as in the\nWest, and that an unreasonable fit of suspicion would be considered the same\nweakness and insult by the one society as by the other.\n\nThe liberty of Madras and Bombay is, however, a reality for all its\nlimitations. And in certain parts of the province of Malabar woman is actually\nin the ascendency. This curious country, of women learned in Sanskrit, and\nkings who rule as the regents of their sisters, will have many disclosures to\nmake to the world when India shall have produced a sufficient number of\ncompetent sociologists of her own blood. It is commonly said to be\ncharacteristically polyandrous; but it is not so, in the same sense as Tibet\nand some of the Himalayan tribes, for no woman regards herself as the wife of\ntwo men at once. The tern matriarchal is more accurate, inasmuch as the\nhusband visits the wife in her own home, and the right of inheritance is\nthrough the mother. Thus, far from India\'s being the land of the uniform\noppression of woman by a uniform method, it represents the whole cycle of\nfeminist institutions. There is literally no theory of feminine rights and\nposition that does not find illustration somewhere within her boundaries.\n\nWith regard to the seclusion of women by Hindus, the statement that it arose\nas a protection against the violence of a ruling race is thoughtless and\nuntrue. The custom in its present rigour dates undoubtedly from the period of\nMoslem rule.\n\np. 71\n\n[paragraph continues] Where that rule was firm and long established, it has\nsunk deep into Hindu habit, and in Bombay and Madras, under opposite\nconditions, leas been almost passed by. In the plays of Kalidas, and in old\nSanskrit literature generally, there is abundant evidence that it was not\npractised in its modern form in the Vedic, Buddhistic, or Puranic periods.\n\nBut although it dates from the era of Ghazni or Ghor--except where the Rajput\nmade an independent introduction of the purdah--there is nothing to show that\nthe cloistering of women was spread in Hindostan by other means than by the\nforce of fashion and imperial prestige. Indeed, sooner or later we have to\nface the question: What induced the Mohammedan to screen his women? Islam\nderives the religious sanction of its social institutions from Arabia, and the\nArab woman is said to enjoy considerable freedom and power. Hence it is\nsometimes claimed that the Mussulman himself adopted the practice from Persia,\nfrom China, or from Greece. Such explanations are little more than\nrecrimination. What are we to regard as the root of a convention which in\ncertain parts of the Orient appears to be almost instinctive? Climate,\ninducing scantiness of clothing, cannot be the whole secret, for in that case\nMadras would be more deeply permeated by the custom than Bengal, whereas the\nvery opposite is the fact.\n\nMight we not as well reverse the inquiry, and try to assign some reason for\nthe Western assumption of _equality_ between man and woman? The first point\nthat strikes us is the very uneven distribution of the theory in Europe\nitself. It is by no means so strong in Latin as in Teutonic countries, nor so\nclearly formulated amongst the Germanic peoples as in the Norse Sagas. This\nfact lends colour to the theory of modern sociologists that fisher-life is the\nsource of all equality between the sexes. For the\n\np. 72\n\nman, pursuing the conquest of the sea, must leave his wife regnant over the\naffairs of field and farm. It is supposed by some that the very use of the\nwedding-ring originated in the investiture of woman at marriage, by means of\nthe signet-ring, with a fulness of authority similar to the husband\'s outside,\nover all that lay within the house. Surely it is clear that land and sea are\nnot the only possible antitheses, but that wherever a race is employed in a\nsustained and arduous conquest of Nature there it will tend towards fulness of\nco-operation, similarity of manners, and equality of rights as between men and\nwomen; and that, other things being equal, under long-settled conditions, from\nwhich anxiety is largely eliminated, there is a progressive inclination\ntowards divergence of their lines of activity, accompanied by the more\ncomplete surrender of woman to the protection of man, and the seeking of her\nindividuality in the sphere of morals and emotion.\n\nThe tendency to divergence of function would be accelerated in Asia by the\nnature of the climate, which makes stillness and passivity the highest luxury.\nThis fact would combine again with military prepossessions, to make the custom\nof seclusion especially characteristic of royal households, and having once\nachieved such social prestige it would speedily extend over wide areas. Thus\nit becomes characteristic of conquering races, and among Hindus is imitated\nwith marked energy by Bengal, which is not only the most idealistic of all the\nIndian provinces, but also--owing to the existence of the zemindar class--the\nmost persistently feudal, after Rajputana.\n\nIf this theory be correct, the freedom of the Indian woman of the first Aryan\nperiod is to be explained as an outcome of the struggle with earth and forest.\nThe early immigrations of agricultural races across the Himalayas from Central\nAsia must have meant a combat with Nature of the severest\n\np. 73\n\nkind. It was a combat in which the wife was the helpmeet of the husband. If he\ncleared the jungle and hunted the game, she had to give aid in field and\ngarden. The Aryan population was scanty, and she would often be required to\ntake his place. Vicissitudes were many. At a moment\'s notice she must be\nprepared to meet an emergency, brave, cheerful, and self-helpful. In such a\nlife woman must move as easily as man.\n\nIt began to be otherwise, however, when the country was cleared, agriculture\nestablished on the Aryan scale, and the energy of the race concentrated on the\nhigher problem of conserving and extending its culture of mind and spirit. It\nis doubtful whether Indian philosophy could ever have been completed on other\nterms than on those of some measure of seclusion for woman. "This world is all\na dream: God alone is real," such an ultimatum could hardly have been reached\nin a society like that of Judaism, where love and beauty were held as the seal\nof divine approval on a successful life. Not that India would decry these\nhappy gifts. But they are secular joys in her eyes, not spiritual. "The\nreligion of the wife lies in serving her husband: the religion of the widow\nlies in serving God," say the women; and there is no doubt in their minds that\nthe widow\'s call is the higher of the two.\n\nWhile we talk of the seclusion of woman, however, as if it were a fact, we\nmust be careful to guard against misconception. In society and in the streets\nof Indian cities, it is practically true that we see men alone. This fact\nmakes it a possibility for the religious to pass his life without looking on\nthe face of any woman, save such as he may call "Mother." Inside the house, if\nwe penetrate so far, we shall probably meet with none but women. But if we\nlive there day after day, we shall find that every woman has familiar\nintercourse with some man or men in\n\np. 74\n\nthe family. The relation between brothers and sisters-in-law is all gaiety and\nsweetness. Scarcely any children are so near to a woman as the sons of her\nhusband\'s sisters. It is the proud prerogative of these, whatever be their\nage, to regard her as their slave. There is a special delicacy of affection\nand respect between the husband\'s father and his daughter-in-law. Cousins\ncount as brothers and sisters. And from the fact that every woman has her\nrightful place in some family it follows that there is more healthy human\nintercourse with men in almost every Hindu woman\'s life than in those of\nthousands of single women, living alone, or following professional careers, in\nthe suburbs of London and other Western cities,\n\nIt is an intercourse, too, that is full of a refined and delicate sense of\nhumour. Indian men who have been to Europe always declare that the zenana\nwoman stands unrivalled in her power of repartee. English fun is apt to strike\nthe Eastern ear as a little loud. How charming is the Bengali version of "the\nbad penny that always turns up," in, "I am the broken cowrie that has been to\nseven markets"! That is to say, "I may be worthless, but I am knowing."\n\nWe are too apt to define the ideal as that towards which we aspire, thinking\nbut rarely of those assimilated ideals which reveal themselves as custom. If\nwe analyse the conventions that dominate an Indian woman\'s life we cannot fail\nto come upon an exceedingly stern canon of self-control. The closeness and\nintimacy of the family life, and the number of the interests that have to be\nconsidered, make strict discipline necessary, doubtless, for the sake of\npeace. Hence a husband and wife may not address each other in the presence of\nothers. A wife may not name her husband, much less praise him, and so on. Only\nlittle children are perfectly untrammelled,\n\np. 75\n\nand may bestow their affection when and where they will. All these things are\nfor the protection of the community, lest it be outraged by the parading of a\nrelationship of intimacy, or victimised by an enthusiast which it could not be\nexpected to share.\n\nThis constant and happy subordination of oneself to others does not strike the\nobserver, only because it is so complete. It is not the characteristic of the\nspecially developed individual alone, for it is recognised and required, in\nall degrees of delicacy, by society at large. Unselfishness and the thirst for\nservice stand out in the Western personality against a background of\nindividualistic conventions, and convey an impression of the eagerness and\nstruggle of pity, without which the world would certainly be the poorer. But\nthe Eastern woman is unaware of any defiance of institutions. She is the\nproduct of an ethical civilisation. Her charities are required of her. Her\nvows and penances are unknown even to her husband; but were they told, they\nwould scarcely excite remark in a community where all make similar sacrifices.\n\nThis is only to say that she is more deeply self-effacing and more effectively\naltruistic than any Western. The duty of tending the sick is so much a matter\nof course to her that she does not dream of it as a special function, for\nwhich one might erect hospitals or learn nursing. Here, no doubt, she misses a\ngreat deal, for the modern organisation of skill has produced a concentration\nof attention on method that avails to save much suffering. Still, we must not\ntoo carelessly assume that our own habit of massing together all the hungry,\nsick, and insane, and isolating them in worlds visited throughout with like\nafflictions to their own, is the product of a higher benevolence on our part.\n\nThroughout the world women are the guardians of humanity\'s ethical ideals. The\nboy would not\n\np. 76\n\nbe so anxious to carry the dead to the burning ghat if his mother had not\nfilled his babyhood with admiration of the deed. The husband would not be so\nstrenuous to return home at his best if his wife did not understand and\nappreciate his noblest qualities. But, even beyond this, women give themselves\nas the perpetual illustration of the ideal. The words, "He that will be chief\namong you let him be your servant," fall on Western ears with a certain sense\nof sublime paradox. But the august Speaker uttered the merest truism of that\nsimple Eastern world in which He moved. He roused no thrill of surprise in the\nminds of His hearers, for to each his own mother was chief, and yet servant of\nall.\n\nThose who, knowing the East, read the list of the seven corporal works of\nmercy, may well start to imagine themselves back in the Hindu home watching\nits laborious, pious women as they move about their daily tasks, never\nquestioning the first necessity of feeding the hungry, harbouring the\nharbourless, and the like. Truly the East is eternally the mother of\nreligions, for the reason that she has assimilated as ordinary social\nfunctions what the West holds to be only the duty of officialism or the\nmessage of the Church, and to those who deeply understand it may well seem\nthat Christianity in Europe is neither more nor less than the mission of the\nAsiatic Life.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:*](wil07.htm#fr_1) It is a fundamental law of Indian economics, but one\nlittle known to present administrators, that for every acre of land kept in\ncultivation, the village should have the grant of one acre of grazing land\nfree.
