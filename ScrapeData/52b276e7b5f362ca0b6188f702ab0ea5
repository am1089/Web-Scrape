Kuns\' counsellor having taken many devils with\nhim, was roaming about and destroying, when Kuns, having sent for a female\ndevil, named Pootna, said to her, go and kill as many of the family of Judoo,\nas you can find. She, hearing this, being highly pleased, and making a\nsalutation, departed. She began to say to herself, "Nund has had a son, I\nheard it in the village of Gokool, I will now lay hold of it by stratagem; I\nwill go as a cowherdess."\n\nHaving said this, ornamenting herself in a most elaborate manner, putting\npoison in her breast, assuming a fascinating appearance, practising deceit,\ntaking a lotus in her hand, being fully adorned, she went forth like Luchmee,\nwhen arrayed in all the ornaments of dress, she goes to meet her lord. Having\narrived in Gokool, she came laughing into the house of Nund.\n\nOn seeing her, all being fascinated, remained as though dispossessed of their\nsenses--She went and sat near Jusodha, and asking the news, gave her a\nblessing. "Sister, may your Krishnu live a crore of years!" Having thus\nproffered friendship, taking the child from Jusodha, and placing it in her\nbosom, when she offered to suckle it, Shree Krishnu, having seized her breast\nwith both his hands, began fastening his\n\np. 32\n\nmouth on her breast, to suck her life with the milk; upon this, Pootna being\ngreatly agitated, exclaimed, "Jusodha, what sort of son is this of your\'s, he\nis not a mortal, but the messenger of death--Thinking it a cord, I have laid\nhold of a snake. If I escape alive from his hands, I will never come to Gokool\nagain." Saying this, she ran off outside the village, but Krishnu did not let\ngo his hold; and all of a sudden, he took her life. She fell down, just as a\nthunderbolt would fall from heaven. Having heard a very great noise, Rohnee\nand Jusodha, weeping and lamenting, came to the spot where Pootna, occupying a\nspace of two koss, had fallen dead; and the whole village came running out\nafter them; they saw Krishnu upon her breast and in the act of sucking the\nmilk--Taking him up quickly, and kissing him, they pressed him to their\nbosoms, and brought him home.\n\nHaving sent for charmers, they began to exorcise him; and the cowherdesses and\ncowherds, standing near Pootna, began to say to each other, "Friend! hearing\nthe sound of her fall, we were so alarmed, that our bosoms are still\npalpitating--Who can say, what the child\'s state may be?"\n\nIn the meantime, Nund Jee having cone from Muttra, saw that a female devil had\nfallen dead, and that a crowd of the inhabitants of Bruj had surrounded her.\nHe enquired how this act of violence had occurred--They began to explain to\nhim, "O great king! first of all she came to your house in a beautiful form,\nand gave a blessing; on seeing her, all the women of Bruj were like persons\ndeprived of their senses. She took Krishnu, and began to suckle him, and after\nthat, we do not know what occurred." On hearing this, Nund Jee said, it is\nvery lucky the child has escaped, and that she did not fall upon Gokool; had\nshe fallen, not one would have escaped; all would have been crushed under her,\nand died. Having thus spoken, Nund Jee came home, and bestowed gifts and\npresents; and the cowherds having brought axes, spades, mattocks and hoes, and\ncutting off the bones and feet of Pootna, dug\n\np. 33\n\nholes, and buried them; and collecting the flesh and skin together burnt them.\n\nFrom her burning, there was such a sweet scent spread abroad, that it filled\nthe whole world with perfume. Having heard thus much, Raja Pureechit said to\nShookdeo Jee, "O great king! that female devil was very unclean, an eater of\nflesh and drinker of wine, please explain how it happened, that a sweet smell\ncame from her body." The sage replied, Raja! Shree Krishnu Chund, having drank\nher milk, granted her absolution, and that was the cause of the perfume coming\nfrom her body.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII](psa09.htm)\n\n'
