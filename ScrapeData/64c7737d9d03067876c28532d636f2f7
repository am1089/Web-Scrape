He now digs that (hole) 3 in the earth; for the gods now were\nafraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this\n(Agni) of\n\np. 242\n\nours!' They made this (earth) to be his self (body), for protection, thinking,\n'The self will protect itself.'\n\n6:5:4:22\\. He digs him out with (the help of) Aditi, in order to guard him\nfrom injury; for Aditi is this earth, and one does not injure one's own self;\nbut were he to dig with (the help of) another deity, he surely would injure\nhim (Agni).\n\n6:5:4:33\\. [Va, . S. XI, 61] 'May the divine Aditi, clear to all the gods, dig\nthee, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, O hole, in the lap of the earth!'--for this hole (is dug)\namong the gods. That bamboo spade now disappears. This hole is four-cornered,\nfor there are four quarters: he thus digs it from all the quarters 1. Having\nthen laid down fuel in it, he silently puts the 'invincible' (brick) thereon,\nfor that is made first.\n\n6:5:4:44\\. He then sets down the fire-pan (with the bottom part upwards),\nwith, 'May the divine wives of the gods, dear to all the gods, place thee,\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine\nwives of the gods, dear to all the gods, indeed, like A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, placed that\n(fire-pan) into the lap of the earth, and by (the help of) them he now places\nit. But, surely, these are the plants,--the wives of the gods are indeed the\nplants; for by the plants everything here is supported: by means of the plants\nhe thus supports this (fire-pan). He then lays down silently the all-light'\n(bricks). Having then placed fuel thereon he kindles it.\n\n6:5:4:55\\. 'May the divine Dhisha _n_ as, dear to all the gods, kindle thee,\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine\n\np. 243\n\n[paragraph continues] Dhisha _n_ as, dear to all the gods, indeed kindled it,\nlike A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, in the lap of the earth, and with their help he now kindles it.\nBut, surely, this is Va _k_ (speech),--the Dhisha _n_ as are indeed speech 1,\nfor by speech everything is kindled here: by means of speech he thus kindles\nthis (fire-pan). Whilst looking at it, he then mutters these three formulas:\n\n6:5:4:66\\. 'May the divine protectresses, dear to all the gods, heat thee, O\nfire-pan, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine\nprotectresses, dear to all the gods, indeed, like A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, heated it in the\nlap of the earth; and by them he now heats it. But, surely, these are the days\nand nights,--the protectresses are indeed the days and nights; for by days and\nnights everything is covered here: by means of the days and nights he thus\nheats it.\n\n6:5:4:77\\. 'May the divine ladies, dear to all the gods, bake thee, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-\nlike, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine ladies, dear\nto all the gods, did, like A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, bake it in the lap of the earth, and with\ntheir help he now bakes it. But, surely, these are the metres,--the ladies\n(gna) are indeed the metres (scripture texts), for by means of these men go\n(gam) to the celestial world: by means of the metres he thus bakes it.\n\n6:5:4:88\\. 'May the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods,\nbake thee, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for\n\np. 244\n\nof old the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, did bake\nit, like A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, in the lap of the earth; and with their help he now bakes\nit. But, surely, these are the stars,--the women ( _g_ ani) are indeed the\nstars, for these are the lights of those righteous men ( _g_ ana) who go to\nthe celestial world: it is by means of the stars that he thus bakes it.\n\n6:5:4:99\\. Now he digs with one (formula), he sets down (the fire-pan) with\none, he kindles with one, he heats with one, he bakes (pa _k_ ) with two,\nwhence twice in the year food is ripened (pa _k_ ); these amount to six,--six\nseasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, so great does this become.\n\n6:5:4:1010\\. And as often as he attends to (the fire by adding fresh fuel) 1\nhe attends to it with the prayer relating to Mitra, '[The protection] of\nMitra, the preserver of men 2 . . .;' for a friend (mitra) does not injure any\none, nor does any one injure his friend; and in like manner does this one not\ninjure that (fire-pan), nor does it (injure) him. By day he should put (fuel)\non it, by day he should clear it (of the ashes).\n\n6:5:4:1111\\. He clears it (of the ashes) with a prayer relating to Savit _ri_\n,--for Savit _ri_ is the impeller: impelled\n\np. 245\n\nby Savit _ri_ , he thus clears it--[Va _g_. S. XI, 63] 'May the divine Savit\n_ri_ , the well-handed, well-fingered, and well-armed, clear thee by his\nmight!'--for Savit _ri_ is all that.\n\n6:5:4:1212\\. He then turns it (the fire-pan) round, with. 'Not tottering upon\nthe earth, fill the regions, the quarters!'--that is, 'not tottering, fill\nthou with sap the regions and quarters on earth!'\n\n6:5:4:1313\\. He then takes it up, with [Va _g_. S. XI, 641 'Having risen, do\nthou become great,'--for these worlds, having risen, are great;--'and stand up\nsteadfast!' that is, 'stand thou up firm and fixed!'\n\n6:5:4:1414\\. Having taken it in both hands, he sets it down, with, 'O Mitra,\nunto thee I consign this fire-pan for safety: may it not break!' for Mitra is\nthat wind which blows yonder: it is to him he thus consigns it for\n.protection; for these worlds are protected by Mitra (or by a friend), whence\nnothing whatever is harmed in these worlds.\n\n6:5:4:1515\\. He then pours (milk) into it,--just for strength, or to (mark)\nthe progress of the work. And, again, why he pours (milk) into it,--that fire-\npan is the head of the sacrifice, and milk is breath: he thus lays breath into\nthe head. Moreover, the fire-pan (ukha, f.) is a female: he thus lays milk\ninto the female, whence there is milk in the female.\n\n6:5:4:1616\\. He pours goat's milk into it to avoid injury 1; for the goat\nsprang from Pra _g_ apati's head, and Pra _g_ apati is Agni; and one does not\ninjure one's own self. And as to why it is goat's (milk),--the goat eats all\n(kinds of) herbs: he thus pours into it (the pan) the sap of all (kinds of)\nherbs.\n\np. 246\n\n6:5:4:1717\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 65] 'May the Vasus fill thee with the Gayatri\nmetre, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like!--May the Rudras fill thee with the Trish _t_ ubh metre,\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like!--May the \xc3\x82dityas fill thee with the _G_ agati metre, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-\nlike!--May the All-gods, dear to all men, fill thee with the Anush _t_ ubh\nmetre, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like!'--by these deities he thus moistens it: by whatever\ndeities he fashions it, by them he fumigates it, and by them he moistens it.\nFor he who performs a work, knows the practice of it: hence by whatever\ndeities he fashions it, by them he fumigates and moistens it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[241:3](sbe4144.htm#fr_477) One might take 'athainam asya _m_ khanati' to\nmean, 'he now digs for him (Agni) in the earth,' or 'digs him into the earth.'\nCf. [VI, 4, 1, 1](sbe4137.htm#6:4:1:1), 'athainam ata _h_ khanati.' Saya _n_\na, however (in accordance with the formula in [paragraph\n3](sbe4144.htm#6:5:4:3)), supplies 'ava _t_ am,' 'a hole.'\n\n[242:1](sbe4144.htm#fr_478) Sarvabhyo digbhya enam ava _t_ a _m_ khanati ta\n_m_ _k_ a sarvasu dikshu nash _t_ ra na hi _m_ santi, Say.\n\n[243:1](sbe4144.htm#fr_479) Whether 'Dhisha _n_ a' (the name of certain female\ndivinities who have the power of bestowing prosperity and granting wishes) is\nhere connected with 'dhish _n_ ya,' fire-hearth; or whether it is taken by the\nauthor in some such primary sense as 'intelligence' or 'inspiration,' it were\ndifficult to decide. Saya _n_ a connects it with 'dhi,'--vag vai dhisha _n_ a,\nsa hi dhiya _m_ karma _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avasani (?) sambha _g_ ate.\n\n[244:1](sbe4144.htm#fr_480) The St. Petersburg dictionary seems to take 'yavat\nkiya _k_ _k_ opanya _k_ arati' in the sense of 'as much (or, as deep) as he\nenters (into the pan).' But see III, 2, 2, 29, where 'yavat kiya _k_ _k_ a . .\n. upasp _ri_ _s_ et' has likewise the meaning 'as often as he touches.' Cf.\nalso Katy. Sr. XVI, 4, 15, He keeps up (the fire by adding fuel), with\n'Mitrasya . . .;' 16, [He repeats the formula] as often (or long) as he keeps\nit up (or, adds fuel).\n\n[244:2](sbe4144.htm#fr_481) Va _g_. S. XI, 62; _Ri_ k S. III, 59, 6, 'The\ngainful protection of the God Mitra, the preserver of men, is glorious and of\nmost wonderful renown.'\n\n[245:1](sbe4144.htm#fr_482) The construction of this, and similar previous\npassages, is the same as that referred to in part ii, p. 15, note 3.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 6, 1.
