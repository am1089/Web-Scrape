Enough of this! ( _Turning toward the dressing-room_.)\nMadam, if you are ready, pray come here. ( _Enter an actress_.)\n\n_Actress_. Here I am, sir. What am I to do?\n\n_Director_. Our audience is very discriminating, and we are to offer them a\nnew play, called _Shakuntala and the ring of recognition_ , written by the\nfamous Kalidasa. Every member of the cast must be on his mettle.\n\n_Actress_. Your arrangements are perfect. Nothing will go wrong.\n\n_Director_ ( _smiling_ ). To tell the truth, madam,\n\nUntil the wise are satisfied,  \n  I cannot feel that skill is shown;  \nThe best-trained mind requires support,  \n  And does not trust itself alone.\n\n_Actress_. True. What shall we do first?\n\n_Director_. First, you must sing something to please the ears of the audience.\n\n_Actress_. What season of the year shall I sing about?\n\np. 4\n\n_Director_. Why, sing about the pleasant summer which has just begun. For at\nthis time of year\n\nA mid-day plunge will temper heat;  \n  The breeze is rich with forest flowers;  \nTo slumber in the shade is sweet;  \n  And charming are the twilight hours.\n\n_Actress_ ( _sings_ ).\n\nThe siris-blossoms fair,  \n  With pollen laden,  \nAre plucked to deck her hair  \n  By many a maiden,  \nBut gently; flowers like these  \n  Are kissed by eager bees.\n\n_Director_. Well done! The whole theatre is captivated by your song, and sits\nas if painted. What play shall we give them to keep their good-will?\n\n_Actress_. Why, you just told me we were to give a new play called _Shakuntala\nand the ring_.\n\n_Director_. Thank you for reminding me. For the moment I had quite forgotten.\n\nYour charming song had carried me away  \nAs the deer enticed the hero of our play.\n\n( _Exeunt ambo_.)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act I. The Hunt](sha05.htm)\n\n"
