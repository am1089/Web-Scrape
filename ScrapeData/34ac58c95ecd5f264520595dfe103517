On account of (such) conduct being seen.\n\nIt is seen, viz in Scripture, that those who knew Brahman busied themselves\nchiefly with sacrifices.--A _s_ vapati Kaikeya had a deep knowledge of the\nSelf; but when three _Ri_ shis had come to him to receive instruction\nregarding the Self, he told them 'I am about, to perform a sacrifice, Sirs' (\n_Kh_. Up. V, II). Similarly we learn from Sm _ri_ ti that _G_ anaka and other\nprinces deeply versed in the knowledge of Brahman applied themselves to\nsacrificial works, 'By works only _G_ anaka and others attained to\nperfection'; 'He also, well founded in knowledge, offered many sacrifices.'\nAnd this fact--that those who know Brahman apply themselves to works chiefly--\nshows that knowledge (or meditation) has no independent value, but serves to\nset forth the true nature of the active Self, and thus is subordinate to work.\n--An even more direct proof is set forth in the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
