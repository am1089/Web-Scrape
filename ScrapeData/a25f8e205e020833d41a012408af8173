Badaraya _n_ a, on the other hand, (maintains) the existence (of\nqualification for Brahma-vidya on the part of the gods); for there are\n(passages indicatory of that).\n\nThe expression 'on the other hand' is meant to rebut the purvapaksha. The\nteacher, Badaraya _n_ a, maintains the existence of the qualification on the\npart of the gods, &c. For, although the qualification of the gods cannot be\nadmitted with reference to the madhu-vidya, and similar topics of knowledge,\nin which the gods themselves are implicated, still they may be qualified for\nthe pure knowledge of Brahman, qualification in general depending on the\npresence of desire, capability, &c. 2 Nor does the impossibility of\nqualification in certain cases interfere with the presence of qualification in\nthose other cases where it is not impossible. To the case of the gods the same\nreasoning applies as to the case of men; for among men also, all are not\nqualified for everything, Brahma _n_ as, for instance, not for the ra _g_\nasuya-sacrifice 3.\n\np. 219\n\n[paragraph continues] And, with reference to the knowledge of Brahman,\nScripture, moreover, contains express hints notifying that the devas are\nqualified; compare, for instance, _Br_ i. Up. 1, 4, 10, 'Whatever Deva was\nawakened (so as to know Brahman) he indeed became that; and the same with _ri_\nshis;' _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 2, 'They said: Well, let us search for that Self by\nwhich, if one has searched it out, all worlds and all desires are obtained.\nThus saying, Indra went forth from the Devas, Viro _k_ ana from the Asuras.'\nSimilar statements are met with in Sm _ri_ ti, so, for instance, in the\ncolloquy of the Gandharva and Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya 1.--Against the objection raised\nin the preceding Sutra (32) we argue as follows. Words like aditya, and so on,\nwhich denote devas, although having reference to light and the like, yet\nconvey the idea of certain divine Selfs (persons) endowed with intelligence\nand pre-eminent power; for they are used in that sense in mantras and\narthavada passages. For the devas possess, in consequence of their pre-eminent\npower, the capability of residing within the light, and so on, and to assume\nany form they like. Thus we read in Scripture, in the arthavada passage\nexplaining the words 'ram of Medhatithi,' which form part of the Subrahma _n_\nya-formula, that 'Indra, having assumed the shape of a ram, carried off\nMedhatithi, the descendant of Ka _n_ va' (Sha _d_ v. Br. I, 1). And thus Sm\n_ri_ ti says that '\xc3\x82ditya, having assumed the shape of a man, came to Kunti.'\nMoreover, even in such substances as earth, intelligent ruling beings must be\nadmitted to reside, for that appears from such scriptural passages as 'the\nearth spoke,' 'the waters spoke,' &c. The non-intelligence of light and the\nlike, in so far as they are mere material elements, is admitted in the case of\nthe sun (aditya), &c. also; but--as already remarked--from the use of the\nwords in mantras and\n\np. 220\n\narthavadas it appears that there are intelligent beings of divine nature\n(which animate those material elements).\n\nWe now turn to the objection (raised above by the purvapakshin) that mantras\nand arthavadas, as merely subserving other purposes, have no power of setting\nforth the personality of the devas, and remark that not the circumstance of\nsubordination or non-subordination to some other purpose, but rather the\npresence or absence of a certain idea furnishes a reason for (our assuming)\nthe existence of something. This is exemplified by the case of a person who,\nhaving set out for some other purpose, (nevertheless) forms the conviction of\nthe existence of leaves, grass, and the like, which he sees lying on the road.\n--But, the purvapakshin may here object, the instance quoted by you is not\nstrictly analogous. In the case of the wanderer, perception, whose objects the\ngrass and leaves are, is active, and through it he forms the conception of\ntheir existence. In the case of an arthavada, on the other hand, which, as\nforming a syntactical unity with the corresponding injunctory passage, merely\nsubserves the purpose of glorifying (the latter), it is impossible to\ndetermine any energy having a special object of its own. For in general any\nminor syntactical unity, which is included in a more comprehensive syntactical\nunity conveying a certain meaning, does not possess the power of expressing a\nseparate meaning of its own. Thus, for instance, we derive, from the\ncombination of the three words constituting the negative sentence, '(Do) not\ndrink wine,' one meaning only, i.e. a prohibition of drinking wine, and do not\nderive an additional meaning, viz. an order to drink wine, from the\ncombination of the last two words, 'drink wine.'--To this objection we reply,\nthat the instance last quoted is not analogous (to the matter under\ndiscussion). The words of the sentence prohibiting the drinking of wine form\nonly one whole, and on that account the separate sense which any minor\nsyntactical unity included in the bigger sentence may possess cannot be\naccepted. In the case of injunction and arthavada, on the other hand, the\nwords constituting the arthavada form a separate group of their own which\nrefers to some accomplished\n\np. 221\n\nthing 1, and only subsequently to that, when it comes to be considered what\npurpose they subserve, they enter on the function of glorifying the\ninjunction. Let us examine, as an illustrative example, the injunctive\npassage, 'He who is desirous of prosperity is to offer to Vayu a white\nanimal.' All the words contained in this passage are directly connected with\nthe injunction. This is, however, not the case with the words constituting the\ncorresponding arthavada passage, 'For Vayu is the swiftest deity; Vayu he\napproaches with his own share; he leads him to prosperity.' The single words\nof this arthavada are not grammatically connected with the single words of the\ninjunction, but form a subordinate unity of their own, which contains the\npraise of Vayu, and glorify the injunction, only in so far as they give us to\nunderstand that the action enjoined is connected with a distinguished\ndivinity. If the matter conveyed by the subordinate (arthavada) passage can be\nknown by some other means of knowledge, the arthavada acts as a mere anuvada,\ni.e. a statement referring to something (already known) 2. When its contents\nare contradicted by other means of knowledge it acts as a so-called gu _n_\navada, i.e. a statement of a quality 3. Where, again, neither of the two\nmentioned conditions is found, a doubt may arise whether the arthavada is to\nbe taken as a gu _n_ avada on account of the absence of other means of\nknowledge, or as an arthavada referring to something known (i.e. an anuvada)\non account of the absence of contradiction by other means of proof. The latter\nalternative is, however, to be embraced by reflecting people.--The same\nreasoning applies to mantras also.\n\nThere is a further reason for assuming the personality of the gods. The Vedic\ninjunctions, as enjoining sacrificial offerings to Indra and the other gods,\npresuppose certain characteristic shapes of the individual divinities, because\n\np. 222\n\nwithout such the sacrificer could not represent Indra and the other gods to\nhis mind. And if the divinity were not represented to the mind it would not be\npossible to make an offering to it. So Scripture also says, 'Of that divinity\nfor which the offering is taken he is to think when about to say vausha _t_ '\n(Ai. Br. III, 8, 1). Nor is it possible to consider the essential form (or\ncharacter) of a thing to consist in the word only 1; for word (denoting) and\nthing (denoted) are different. He therefore who admits the authoritativeness\nof the scriptural word has no right to deny that the shape of Indra, and the\nother gods, is such as we understand it to be from the mantras and arthavadas.\n--Moreover, itihasas and pura _n_ as also--because based on mantra and\narthavada which possess authoritative power in the manner described--are\ncapable of setting forth the personality, &c. of the devas. Itihasa and pura\n_n_ a can, besides, be considered as based on perception also. For what is not\naccessible to our perception may have been within the sphere of perception of\npeople in ancient times. Sm _ri_ ti also declares that Vyasa and others\nconversed with the gods face to face. A person maintaining that the people of\nancient times were no more able to converse with the gods than people are at\npresent, would thereby deny the (incontestable) variety of the world. He might\nas well maintain that because there is at present no prince ruling over the\nwhole earth, there were no such princes in former times; a position by which\nthe scriptural injunction of the ra _g_ asuya-sacrifice  2would be stultified.\nOr he might maintain that in former times the spheres of duty of the different\ncastes and a _s_ ramas were as generally unsettled as they are now, and, on\nthat account, declare those parts of Scripture which define those different\nduties to be purposeless. It is therefore altogether unobjectionable to assume\nthat the men of ancient times, in consequence of their eminent religious\n\np. 223\n\nmerit, conversed with the gods face to face. Sm _ri_ ti also declares that\n'from the reading of the Veda there results intercourse with the favourite\ndivinity' (Yoga Sutra II, 44). And that Yoga does, as Sm _ri_ ti declares,\nlead to the acquirement of extraordinary powers, such as subtlety of body, and\nso on, is a fact which cannot be set aside by a mere arbitrary denial.\nScripture also proclaims the greatness of Yoga, 'When, as earth, water, light,\nheat, and ether arise, the fivefold quality of Yoga takes place, then there is\nno longer illness, old age, or pain for him who has obtained a body produced\nby the fire of Yoga' ( _S_ vet. Up. II, 12). Nor have we the right to measure\nby our capabilities the capability of the _ri_ shis who see the mantras and\nbrahma _n_ a passages (i.e. the Veda).--From all this it appears that the\nitihasas and pura _n_ as have an adequate basis.--And the conceptions of\nordinary life also must not be declared to be unfounded, if it is at all\npossible to accept them.\n\nThe general result is that we have the right to conceive the gods as\npossessing personal existence, on the ground of mantras, arthavadas, itihasas,\npura _n_ as, and ordinarily prevailing ideas. And as the gods may thus be in\nthe condition of having desires and so on, they must be considered as\nqualified for the knowledge of Brahman. Moreover, the declarations which\nScripture makes concerning gradual emancipation 1agree with this latter\nsupposition only.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[218:2](sbe34102.htm#fr_215) See above, [p. 197](sbe34094.htm#page_197).\n\n[218:3](sbe34102.htm#fr_216) Which can be offered by kshattriyas only.\n\n[219:1](sbe34102.htm#fr_217) _S_ rautali _n_ genanumanabadha _m_ dar _s_\nayitva smartenapi tadbadha _m_ dar _s_ ayati smartam iti.
