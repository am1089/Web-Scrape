Those devotees who, ever-steadfast, thus worship Thee, and those also who\nworship the Imperishable, the Unmanifested,--which of them are better versed\nin Yoga? 1\n\np. 277\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n2\\. Those who, fixing their mind on Me, worship Me, ever-steadfast, and\nendowed with supreme Shraddha, they in My opinion are the best versed in Yoga.\n\np. 278\n\n3-4. But those also, who worship the Imperishable, the Indefinable, the\nUnmanifested, the Omnipresent, the Unthinkable, the Unchangeable, the\nImmovable, the Eternal,--having subdued all the senses, even-minded\neverywhere, engaged in the welfare of all beings, verily, they reach only\nMyself. 3\n\n5\\. Greater is their trouble whose minds are set on the Unmanifested; for the\ngoal of the Unmanifested is very hard for the embodied to reach. 5\n\np. 279\n\n6-7. But those who worship Me, resigning all actions in Me, regarding Me as\nthe Supreme Goal, meditating on Me with single-minded Yoga,--to these whose\n\np. 280\n\nmind is set on Me, verily, I become ere long, O son of Pritha, the Saviour out\nof the ocean of the mortal Samsara. 6\n\n8\\. Fix thy mind on Me only, place thy intellect in Me: (then) thou shalt no\ndoubt live in Me hereafter. 8\n\n9\\. If thou art unable to fix thy mind\n\np. 281\n\nsteadily on Me, then by Abhyasa-Yoga do thou seek to reach Me, O Dhananjaya. 9\n\n10\\. If also thou art unable to practise Abhyasa, be thou intent on doing\nactions -for My sake. Even by doing actions for My sake, thou shalt attain\nperfection.\n\n11\\. If thou art unable to do even\n\np. 282\n\nthis, then taking refuge in Me, abandon the fruit of all action, self-\ncontrolled. 11\n\n12\\. Better indeed is knowledge than (blind) Abhyasa; meditation (with\nknowledge) is more esteemed than (mere) knowledge; than meditation the\nrenunciation\n\np. 283\n\nof the fruit of action; peace immediately follows renunciation. 12\n\np. 284\n\n13-14. He who hates no creature, and is friendly and compassionate towards\nall, who is free from the feelings of \'I and mine,\' even-minded in pain and\npleasure, forbearing, ever content, steady in meditation, self-controlled, and\npossessed of firm conviction, with mind and intellect fixed on Me,--he who is\nthus devoted to Me, is dear to Me.\n\n15\\. He by whom the world is not agitated and who cannot be agitated by the\nworld, who is freed from joy, envy, fear and anxiety,--he is dear to Me.\n\np. 285\n\n16\\. He who is free from dependence, who is pure, prompt, unconcerned,\nuntroubled, renouncing every undertaking,--he who is thus devoted to Me, is\ndear to Me. 16\n\n17\\. He who neither rejoices, nor hates, nor grieves, nor desires, renouncing\ngood and evil, full of devotion, he is dear to Me. 17\n\np. 286\n\n18-19. He who is the same to friend and foe, and also in honour and dishonour;\nwho is the same in heat and cold, and in pleasure and pain; who is free from\nattachment; to whom censure and praise are equal; who is silent, content with\nanything, homeless, steady-minded, full of devotion,--that man is dear to Me.\n18\n\np. 287\n\n20\\. And they who follow this Immortal Dharma, as described above, endued with\nShraddha, regarding Me as the Supreme Goal, and devoted,--they are exceedingly\ndear to Me.\n\nThe end of the twelfth chapter designated, The Way of Devotion.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[276:1](sbg17.htm#fr_265) _Thus:_ as declared in the last preceding verse (xi.\n55).\n\n_The Unmanifested_ --Avyaktam-- _i.e._ , That which is incomprehensible to the\nsenses, as devoid of all Upadhis.\n\n[278:3](sbg17.htm#fr_266) _Worship_ --Upasana--is approaching the object of\nworship by way of meditating on it, in accordance with the teachings of the\nShastras and the Guru, and dwelling steadily in the current of that one\nthought, even as a thread of oil poured from one vessel to another.\n\n_Unchangeable_ --Kutastha: lit., remaining like a mass. He who is seated in\nMaya as its Witness.\n\n[278:5](sbg17.htm#fr_267) p. 279 _The embodied_ --Those who are attached to,\nor have identified themselves with, their bodies.\n\nNo comparison between the worshippers of the qualified and unqualified Brahman\nis meant here--since by the context, both reach the same goal. The path of the\nqualified Brahman is described as superior only because it is easier. The path\nof the unqualified Brahman is harder, because of the necessity of having to\nabandon all attachment to the body, from the very beginning of the practice.\n\n[280:6](sbg17.htm#fr_268) _Mortal Sams ara:_ The round of birth and death.\n\n[280:8](sbg17.htm#fr_269) _Mind_ --Manas: purpose and thought.\n\n_Intellect_ --the faculty which resolves and determines.\n\n_Live in Me_ --as My Self.\n\n[281:9](sbg17.htm#fr_270) _Abhy asa-Yoga:_ the practice of repeatedly\nwithdrawing the mind from the objects to which it wanders, and trying to fix\nit on one thing.\n\n[282:11](sbg17.htm#fr_271) In the preceding Slokas,--first, the concentration\nof the mind on the Lord is enjoined; in case of inability to do that, Abhyasa-\nYoga is advised; if one finds that to be too hard, the performance of actions\nfor the sake of the Lord alone, has been taught. Those who cannot do this\neven, who want to do things impelled by personal or other desires, are\ndirected to give up the fruits of those actions to the Lord-- _i.e._ , not to\nanticipate, dwell or build on, or care for, the results, knowing them to be\ndependent upon the Lord. Those who cannot control their desire for work are\ntaught to practise: indifference to the effects thereof.\n\n[283:12](sbg17.htm#fr_272) Renunciation of the fruit of all action, as a means\nto the attainment of Bliss, is merely extolled here by the declaration of the\nsuperiority of one over another. Wherefore? Because it constitutes a common\nfactor which immediately precedes Peace, both in the case of the man of wisdom\nwho is steadily engaged in devout contemplation, and also of the ignorant one\nwho, unable to tread the paths taught before, takes it up as the easiest means\nto Bliss.\n\n[285:16](sbg17.htm#fr_273) _Free from dependence_ --on the body, the senses,\nthe sense-objects, and their mutual connections.\n\nPrompt: able to decide rightly and immediately in matters demanding prompt\naction.\n\n_Every undertaking_ --calculated to secure objects of desire, whether of this\nworld or of the next.\n\n[285:17](sbg17.htm#fr_274) _Hates:_ Frets at receiving anything undesirable.\n\n_Grieves_ --at parting with a beloved object.\n\n_Desires_ --the unattained.\n\n[286:18](sbg17.htm#fr_275) _Content with anything, homeless:_ content with the\nbare means of bodily sustenance. Says the Mahabharata,--p. 287\n\n"Who is clad with anything, who is fed on any food, who lies down anywhere,\nhim the gods call a Brahman."-- _Shanti Parva_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Thirteenth Chapter.
