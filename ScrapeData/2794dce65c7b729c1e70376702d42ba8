Now follows the ceremony of setting a bull at liberty, (which should take\nplace)\n\n2\\. On the days of full moon in Karttika or \xc3\x82 _s_ vina.\n\nWhen performing this rite, he must first examine the bull.\n\n[63. The term mano _g_ \xc3\xb1a, 'a pleasant spot,' means 'a place close by the\nhouse, where sacred basil is planted,' or other such places. (Nand.)\n\n67\\. 1 See the next chapter,\n\nLXXXVI. 1-18. Par. III, 9; _S_ a _n_ kh. III, 11. Regarding the corresponding\nsection of the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra, see Introduction.]\n\np. 261\n\n4\\. (The bull must be) the offspring of a milch cow having young ones living.\n\n5\\. He must have all marks.\n\n6\\. He must be dark-coloured;\n\n7\\. Or red, but having a white mouth, a white tail.. and white feet and horns.\n\n8\\. He must be one who protects the herd.\n\n9\\. Then, after having (kindled) a blazing fire among the cows (in the cow-\npen) and strewed Ku _s_ a grass around it, let him boil with milk a dish\nsacred to Pushan, and offer (two oblations) in the fire with the Mantras, 'May\nPushan follow our cows[1],' and 'Here is pleasure[2].' And let a blacksmith\nmark the bull.\n\n10\\. On the one flank (the right), with a discus; on the other flank (the\nleft), with a trident.\n\n11\\. After he has been marked, let him wash the bull with the four Mantras,\n(beginning with the words), 'The golden-coloured[1],' and with (the five\nMantras, beginning with the words), 'May the divine (waters help and\npropitiate us')[2].\n\n12\\. Having washed and adorned the bull, he must bring him near, together with\nfour young cows,\n\n[5. 'I.e. the bull must not be deficient in any limb.' (Nand.) This\ninterpretation is supported by the G _ri_ hya-sutras.\n\n6\\. Nand. mentions two interpretations of the term nila, 'dark-coloured:' 1. a\nbull who is all white, and is therefore said to be of the 'Brahma _n_ a kind;'\n2. one whose body is white, whereas his tail, his hoofs, and his face are\nblack, and his horns blue. Cf. L, 25.\n\n8\\. Nand. interprets yuthasya _kh_ adakam by nishektaram, 'one who covers the\ncows.' My rendering is based upon Devapala's comment on the corresponding\npassage of the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra. See also Par. and Sa _n_ kh. loc.\ncit.\n\n9\\. 1 Rig-veda VI, 54, 5, &c.--2 Vagas. Sa _m_ h. VIII, 51; Ka _th_. \xc3\x82 _s_ v.\nIV, 6, &c.\n\n11\\. 1 Taitt. Sa _m_ h. V, 6, 1, 1, 2, &c. Rig-veda X, 9, 4 -8. &c.]\n\np. 262\n\nwhich must also have been washed and decorated, and he must mutter the\nRudras[1], the Purushasukta, and the Kushma _nd_ is[2].\n\n13\\. Then let him pronounce in the bull's right ear the Mantra, 'The father of\ncalves;'\n\n14\\. And the following (Mantras):\n\n15\\. 'Holy law is a bull and is declared to have four feet[1]: him I choose\nfor the object of my worship; may he protect me wholly.\n\n16\\. 'This young (bull) I give you as husband (O ye calves), roam about\nsportingly with him for your lover. May we not be deficient in progeny, O king\nSoma, and may we live long, and may we not be oppressed by our enemies.'\n\n17\\. He must drive away the bull together with the calves in a north-eastern\ndirection and give a pair of garments, gold, and a vessel made of white copper\nto the officiating priest.\n\n18\\. The blacksmith shall receive as wages as much as he claims, and food\nprepared with a great deal of butter, and (three) Brahma _n_ as shall be fed.\n\n19\\. Any pool from which the bull drinks after\n\n[12. 'Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 5, 1-11.--2 See LVI, 7.\n\n13\\. Nand. states expressly that this Mantra is from the Ka _th_ aka. It is\nfound Ka _th_. XIII, 9; Taitt. Sa _m_ h. III, 3, 9, 2; Ka _th_. G _ri_ hya-\nsutra XLVII.\n\n15\\. 1 This term refers perhaps to the 'four feet of a judicial proceeding.'\nSee Narada I, 11; 2, 9.\n\n16\\. Taitt. Sa _m_ h. III, 3, 9, 1, &c. The second half of this Mantra is\nfound in the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra only.\n\n18\\. The clause regarding the 'food,' which has been rendered in accordance\nwith Nand.'s Commentary, might also be construed with 'fed,' which would bring\nthe whole into accordance with the precepts of the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-\nsutra and of the two other G _ri_ hya-sutras.]\n\np. 263\n\nhaving been set at liberty) that entire pool will refresh the manes of him who\nhas set the bull at liberty.\n\n20\\. The earth which is anywhere dug up by the bull exulting in his strength,\nis converted into delicious food and drink to satisfy the manes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXXXVII.](sbe07089.htm)\n\n"
