The higher psychic powers are developed\nthrough Mantras, Postures, Mudras, etc., but the true Jnani (truth seeker)\ndoes not seek or need the higher psychic powers. The truth seeker will ever\ntry to attain the true vision of the Atma. The Jnani always tries to rest in\nwisdom but never goes in quest of psychic powers, levitation, etc.. Desire for\nworldly things or possessions are mere Maya (illusion).\n\n"These Jnanis (truth seekers) who have risen above Maya (illusion) will never\nsink into it again. Jnanis who desire [psychic](errata.htm#21) power may\ndevelop it by Mantras, Postures, Mudras, etc., but psychic powers in their\ndevelopment will never bring beneficent liberation. That is the goal of the\ntrue Jnani (truth\n\np. 166\n\nseeker). Desire for psychic powers tends to bondage; for that reason it will\nnever appeal to the truth seeker.\n\n"To those who have given up all desires, the Atma Jnana (Wisdom of Self) will\narise without any doubt. But those who are after Sidhas (psychic powers) only,\nwhich is the seed of desire, will never attain Atma (the Self) ."\n\n"Please explain the secret of the Yogis who live as long as a Kalpa",\n(4,380,000 years) asked Ram, of Rishi Vashisht.\n\nThe Master answered: "As long as Prana is moving, the Yogi is moving, but When\nmovement or Prana ceases, the Yogi becomes as immovable as a rock. Those Yogis\nwho can control Prana (vital force) may live as long as they desire. By\ncontrolling Prana (vital force), the mind also is controlled, externally and\ninternally. He who controls Prana and mind arrests old age and death. Old age\nand death will never come near him. As the body becomes spiritualized, it will\nnever retrograde.\n\n"Those Yogis only can be said to have found the [Reality](errata.htm#22), who\nalways follow the path of Atma Jnani (wisdom of the Self). They, who have\n\np. 167\n\ngiven up all their desires and have been liberated from mental bonds, are\nfree."\n\n"By giving up all desires, the mind is merged into its Reality; then what\nbecomes of the four gunas (qualities)?" asked Ram, of the Master.\n\nRishi Vashisht answered: "There are two ways in which the mind may be\ncontrolled, as the mind consists of the formless and the formed. By\ncontrolling the Rupa (with form) mind, one will bring about the Jivanmukti\nstate (embodied emancipation or liberation in this life). By controlling Arupa\n(formless) mind, one will bring the Videhmukti state (emancipation of the\nSoul).\n\n"Uncontrolled Rupa (with form) mind, generates all kinds of pain. But by\ncontrol bliss will come. You must master Rupa (with form) mind, as it\nidentifies itself with matter. Then it is not able to find its Reality, and\ntherefore it brings pain. This form mind is the ego. This form mind is ever\ninvolved in pleasures and pain. It is the seed of Maya (illusion). This will\ngive you the idea of the Rupa (with form) mind.\n\n"Now I will deal with the controlling of the\n\np. 168\n\nmind. Please listen. It is said by the wise that the fruitless mind can be\ncontrolled by looking with equal eyes upon all, and not being affected by\npleasure or pain. As the mountain is not affected by the storm, also one is\nable to retain his poise in the presence of riches or poverty, joy or sorrow.\nOf such a person it may be said; he has control over his mind; he has overcome\nignorance, which is the lower mind itself. Through control it brings out high\n[spiritual](errata.htm#23) intelligence. Such a mind does not subject itself\nto rebirth. By the desires of the four gunas (qualities), one will come to the\nstate which belongs to the Jivanmukta (embodied emancipation) or (liberation)\nin this life.\n\n"This Rupa (with form) mind, is the destroyer of the peace of mind. In this\nmind the four gunas (qualities) will grow as the lotus in the lake. By\ncontrolling the Arupa (formless mind), one may gain the state of Videhmukti\n(emancipation of the soul.) This state will be attained by overcoming the four\ngunas (qualities) known as: Sattva (truthfulness), Raja (ambition for name and\nfame), Tamas (evildoing), etc..\n\n"There is no other way of controlling the\n\np. 169\n\n[paragraph continues] Arupa (formless) mind, than doing away with differences.\nThe Brahmic state is that in which one does not see differences. What has or\nhas not been, that which has or has not qualities, which has or has not\nwealth, contentment or discontentment, light or darkness, day or night.\n\n"This state is the home of those who have conquered all desires toward this\nuniverse. One becomes like Akasa (ether) or air, which is not affected, but\ntakes odors. These great Yogis, living as if their bodies were Akasa (ether)\nare in the Brahmic state, that is all bliss. Pain, pleasure, name or fame does\nnot affect them in any way. These great ones have controlled their minds."\n\n"What is its seed? "What is the seed of this seed? And what is the seed of the\nlast one?", asked Ram. "Please explain to me."\n\nRishi Vashisht answered: "The body is the first seed, it generates all\npleasure and pain. It gives rise to the ever revolving Samsara (universe). The\nseed of this seed is the mind, which always pursues the track of desires and\nis the cause of pleasure and of pain, birth and death. By the mind, hosts of\nbodies are generated, which\n\np. 170\n\nseem to exist though they do not exist. It enjoys these bodily objects as in a\ndream.\n\n"To this mind, which is always surrounded or encircled by the worldly action,\nthere are two seeds. One is desire, the other is Prana (life force). These are\nthe four seeds. O Ram, the all-pervading one wisdom becomes the visible\nwisdom, by the motion of Prana (life force). If this Prana (life force)\nstopped expanding in every direction, then it would attend one\'s welfare and\nprogress.\n\n"The intelligence becomes attached to the visible world by desire. The visible\nworld is the root of all misery. If the intelligence could always remain in\nthe dreamless state, without lapsing into the dreaming state, that would be\nthe real Nirvana or the Atma. It would result in liberation, or freedom from\nrebirth.\n\n"If the desire for sensual objects, which arise through the Prana movement are\ngradually controlled, the accumulation of these thoughts will constitute mind.\nWith such a mind alone, people live in this world. For controlling this kind\nof mind, the wise and the Yogi practice or perform Pranayama. Pranayama is the\npractice\n\np. 171\n\nof controlling Prana (life force) and concentration. The wise say, that the\nbenefit of control of the Prana (vital force) brings the equality of mind--the\nability to look upon all as one. This generates blessed joy and not pain.\n\n"The seed of the mind seed is the ego, which with its partner, desire, enjoys\nthe external objects. The desires make people slaves [of](errata.htm#24) the\nsensual objects. The power of true discrimination is developed through firm\ndetermination. If this power is lost, the ego or false self binds itself to\nthe mercy of desires, which make it see, that which is real as unreal and\nregards that which is unreal, as the real. The power of desire makes\neverything appear in an illusory light. This mind is most disgraceful, as it\nidentifies the "I" with that which is not "I". Through this mind, old age,\ndeath and birth are brought about.\n\n"As the oscillating of the mind arises through its confusion with objects,\nbirth and death, also arise. It is only when this mind is subdued and has no\nmore attraction or repulsion toward objects, that it will cease oscillating.\n\n"If thoughts are controlled by giving up desires,\n\np. 172\n\nthe result will surely be peace of mind. If there is no desire for worldly\nthings, then how can this mind go roaming in the sky? O Ram!\n\n"I think so long as sensual thought exists in the mind, so long will desires\nremain. The idea of their reality, and the enjoyment of pleasure therein, can\nbe said to be the thought of the mind. All thought or desire makes karma.\n\n"How can mind oscillate in the wise, who are purer than ether, and have risen\nabove desires? It is said, that the realization of Reality by one who\nunderstands true discrimination, is that he is not in this material world, and\nthe world is all Maya (illusion), made by the mind.\n\n"The wise say that the mind denudes itself of its form, even though engaged in\nactions. When mind has dissolved all things into itself, then it becomes as\ncool and refreshing as ambrosia. Those Jivanmuktas (liberated in this life)\nwho have freed themselves from desires, will live to wear out their past\nkarma. Those Jivanmuktas are in [possession](errata.htm#25) of pure desires,\nwithout any pain or rebirth. It is these emancipated ones, whose minds have\nfound the Reality of Being, and have reached the highest wisdom. It is these\n\np. 173\n\n[paragraph continues] Jivanmuktas (bodily emancipated) who, when they give up\nthe body, attain the highest state, as they are the lofty ones.\n\n"The two seeds of mind as has been stated before, are the desires, and the\nmovement of Prana, and if one of them is controlled, both are controlled. By\ndesire, Prana is moved, and by Prana desire is moved. Therefore, we may say\nthat these seed motions of Prana and desire are the dried fruits of the mind,\nand their roots are in the external world. Hence, if they are released from\nthe external world, then the movement of Prana and desires are also\ncontrolled. The mental actions are the seeds of the eternal world. If the\nintelligence does not play its part in the external world, then the external\nworld will cease to exist. As the sesame oil cannot exist without the sesame\nseed, so the existence of the external and the internal are not different.\n\n"The awakening of pure wisdom will produce a kind of creation, through which\npure wisdom will see in itself the external objects. As in a dream, though one\nforgets himself, still he sees things in himself by some inherent power:\n\np. 174\n\nso the external is known by mental knowledge. Those who by their knowledge of\ndiscrimination control this reflected mind, whether they have analyzed it or\nnot, will also control disease and death. It is the non-control of the\nreflected of the external, that puts us into the great universe, but through\nits control the goal is attained. Who can say that the external does not bring\ngreat pain upon us, O Ram?\n\n"Through the absence, of the external and the nonrelation of objects, arises\ndivine bliss. You may stop your mind from oscillating, give up all love for\nworldly enjoyment, forget the objective world, and still not be in a dull\nstate. Thou art above the [Paramatma](errata.htm#26) (universal soul). In the\nwisdom state, the external is not seen. This is true, without doubt."\n\nRam asked: "How can non-intelligence arise, where there is no visible or\nexternal? How can the external or visible vanish, from where there is no\nwisdom?"\n\n\'Master Vashisht answered: "Atma (the self) is the All-pervading One, without\nany attraction. It has no power of knowing nor not-knowing. Any inert object\nis without the visible or intelligence.\n\np. 175\n\n[paragraph continues] If Atma attains, then that wisdom will not be mixed with\nthe visible or objective. It will stand alone. Though engaged in all actions,\nit will not be affected by the visible or objective. He, alone, is the Jnani\n(True wise); he alone, is the Jivanmukta (emancipated). Such a person by\ncontrolling all desires is as a child in intelligence. At this stage when all\nexternal subjects are given up, he attains full Atmic Wisdom, without any\nmental knowledge. Then he will not be attached to any object, but liberated\nfront pain through Divine Bliss, or Samadhi. He will have all bliss. A truth\nseeker should always cling to such meditation, without longing for the unreal,\nand he will always enjoy himself in his own Blessed Atma, whether walking,\ntalking or working. He will be above all of those conditions, as they have no\nattraction for him. He is not attracted by the external with its enjoyment,\nbut lives in consciousness of perfect bliss.\n\n"Understand thoroughly this wisdom, and you become conscious of the truth that\nyou are the All-pervading Wisdom itself, after rising above the sea of pain,\nalthough engaged in worldly activities.\n\np. 176\n\n"To this wisdom the Eternal Absolute is the seed. Out of this One-ness, wisdom\narises as the light from a flame. The One-ness has two appearances. Now, I\nshall explain them; jars, vases and other objects appear to be different, but\nstill they are all one, as they are all made of earth. The seat of the Truth\nis in One-ness alone, non-dual, without any attributes. Therefore, you should\nbe free from the three elements--time, space, and causation, and sink thyself\ninto the Eternal Absolute. Time, space and causation seem to be three\ndifferent elements in their action, but they belong to One-ness. These three\nelements are the cause of creating diversified action, in this world.\n\n"Meditate alone upon the Non-dual or One-ness which is common to all. You may\npervade everywhere with the Self-bliss, that which is the goal of One-ness.\nThat state is the seed of this pure One-ness. From this One-ness the universal\nconsciousness arises. From this point all thought of doubt vanishes, and one\ngains a blessed consciousness, of ever present joy. This is the primal seed,\nbut there is no seed to the state of Pure Wisdom. He, who is capable of\nholding\n\np. 177\n\nthe Pure Wisdom without wavering, will never sink himself into illusion. This\nis the cause of al, but it is a causeless cause, it is the essence of all, but\nthere is no essence to it.\n\n\'In this great glass (the Self), all things will appear as images, as do the\ntrees in the bank of a lake, where they are reflected in the water. This is\nthe Pure One. It alone is the ageless; it alone is the Atmic Reality. By\nattaining this state, the mind will become peaceful. May you, after realizing\nit firmly, become that Atma. May you attain that Nirvanic state."\n\nRam said to the Master: "Thou hast been kind enough to explain about the\nnature of four seeds. With what effort, can one attain that state of bliss and\nwisdom?"\n\nMaster Vashisht replied: "By proper efforts in the direction of overcoming\nthose seeds, and the cause of the pains, which I have explained, the state of\nbliss and wisdom may be attained. To reach that state is the highest of all\nother states, and is the common goal of all. You will have to give up the\nentire host of desires, for if any are left lingering with you, it may be a\nhindrance to your progress. Realize your Higher Self,\n\np. 178\n\nand at that very moment, you will have attained that highest state. Should\nthat One-ness, just referred to, be first attained by you, then, with a little\nmore effort you will attain the highest state. Therefore, direct your\nmeditation toward attainment of this state of One-ness, and the rest will\nfollow.\n\n"O Ram, it is difficult indeed, to reach this blissful state, as long as one\nclings to the external world. With all your might you should endeavor to give\nup the idea of duality and desires, then, all mental discord, disease and pain\nwill vanish. One will find it as difficult to control the desires, as to\nremove the mountain. As long as the desires are not controlled, the mind will\nbe uncontrolled. As long as the mind is not mastered, so long desires will not\nbe mastered, as they are one. As long as Pure Wisdom has not arisen, so long\nthe desires will be uncontrolled. Pure Wisdom, the controlling power of mind\nand mastery of desires, is naturally dependent upon no other cause than it-\nself, for its control or mastery. It is by effort of his will, that the Yogi\nwalks in the right path."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: How to Live](yvhf14.htm)\n\n'
