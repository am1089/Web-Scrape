"Have we\nbeen able," I began, "to believe with all our heart in the god for whose\nworship we have been born all these millions of years, until he actually made\nhimself visible to us?\n\n"How often have I told you," I continued, "that had I not seen you I never\nwould have known all my country as One. I know not yet whether you rightly\nunderstand me. The gods are invisible only in their heaven--on earth they show\nthemselves to mortal men."\n\nBimala looked at me in a strange kind of way as she gravely replied: "Indeed I\nunderstand you, Sandip." This was the first time she called me plain Sandip.\n\n"Krishna," I continued, "whom Arjuna ordinarily knew only as the driver of his\nchariot, had also His universal aspect, of which, too, Arjuna had a vision one\nday, and that day he saw the Truth. I have seen your Universal Aspect in my\ncountry. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra are the chains of gold that wind round\nand round your neck; in the woodland fringes on the distant banks of the dark\nwaters of the river, I have seen your collyrium-darkened eyelashes; the\nchangeful sheen of your _sari_ moves for me in the play of light and shade\namongst the swaying shoots of green corn; and the blazing summer heat, which\nmakes the whole sky lie gasping like a red-tongued lion in the desert, is\nnothing but your cruel radiance.\n\n"Since the goddess has vouchsafed her presence to her votary in such wonderful\nguise, it is for me to proclaim her worship throughout our land, and then\nshall the country gain new life. \'Your image make we in temple after temple.\'\n20 But this our people have not yet fully realized. So I would call on them in\nyour name and offer for their worship an image from which none shall be able\nto withhold belief. Oh give me this boon, this power."\n\nBimala\'s eyelids drooped and she became rigid in her seat like a figure of\nstone. Had I continued she would have gone off into a trance. When I ceased\nspeaking she opened wide her eyes, and murmured with fixed gaze, as though\nstill dazed: "O Traveller in the path of Destruction! Who is there that can\nstay your progress? Do I not see that none shall stand in the way of your\ndesires? Kings shall lay their crowns at your feet; the wealthy shall hasten\nto throw open their treasure for your acceptance; those who have nothing else\nshall beg to be allowed to offer their lives. O my king, my god! What you have\nseen in me I know not, but I have seen the immensity of your grandeur in my\nheart. Who am I, what am I, in its presence? Ah, the awful power of\nDevastation! Never shall I truly live till it kills me utterly! I can bear it\nno longer, my heart is breaking!"\n\nBimala slid down from her seat and fell at my feet, which she clasped, and\nthen she sobbed and sobbed and sobbed.\n\nThis is hypnotism indeed--the charm which can subdue the world! No materials,\nno weapons--but just the delusion of irresistible suggestion. Who says "Truth\nshall Triumph"?"  21 Delusion shall win in the end. The Bengali understood\nthis when he conceived the image of the ten-handed goddess astride her lion,\nand spread her worship in the land. Bengal must now create a new image to\nenchant and conquer the world. _Bande Mataram_!\n\nI gently lifted Bimala back into her chair, and lest reaction should set in, I\nbegan again without losing time: "Queen! The Divine Mother has laid on me the\nduty of establishing her worship in the land. But, alas, I am poor!"\n\nBimala was still flushed, her eyes clouded, her accents thick, as she replied:\n"You poor? Is not all that each one has yours? What are my caskets full of\njewellery for? Drag away from me all my gold and gems for your worship. I have\nno use for them!"\n\nOnce before Bimala had offered up her ornaments. I am not usually in the habit\nof drawing lines, but I felt I had to draw the line there.  22 I know why I\nfeel this hesitation. It is for man to give ornaments to woman; to take them\nfrom her wounds his manliness.\n\nBut I must forget myself. Am I taking them? They are for the Divine Mother, to\nbe poured in worship at her feet. Oh, but it must be a grand ceremony of\nworship such as the country has never beheld before. It must be a landmark in\nour history. It shall be my supreme legacy to the Nation. Ignorant men worship\ngods. I, Sandip, shall create them.\n\nBut all this is a far cry. What about the urgent immediate? At least three\nthousand is indispensably necessary--five thousand would do roundly and\nnicely. But how on earth am I to mention money after the high flight we have\njust taken? And yet time is precious!\n\nI crushed all hesitation under foot as I jumped up and made my plunge: "Queen!\nOur purse is empty, our work about to stop!"\n\nBimala winced. I could see she was thinking of that impossible fifty thousand\nrupees. What a load she must have been carrying within her bosom, struggling\nunder it, perhaps, through sleepless nights! What else had she with which to\nexpress her loving worship? Debarred from offering her heart at my feet, she\nhankers to make this sum of money, so hopelessly large for her, the bearer of\nher imprisoned feelings. The thought of what she must have gone through gives\nme a twinge of pain; for she is now wholly mine. The wrench of plucking up the\nplant by the roots is over. It is now only careful tending and nurture that is\nneeded.\n\n"Queen!" said I, "that fifty thousand rupees is not particularly wanted just\nnow. I calculate that, for the present, five thousand or even three will\nserve."\n\nThe relief made her heart rebound. "I shall fetch you five thousand," she said\nin tones which seemed like an outburst of song--the song which Radhika of the\nVaishnava lyrics sang:\n\nFor my lover will I bind in my hair  \nThe flower which has no equal in the three worlds!\n\n\\--it is the same tune, the same song: five thousand will I bring! That flower\nwill I bind in my hair!\n\nThe narrow restraint of the flute brings out this quality of song. I must not\nallow the pressure of too much greed to flatten out the reed, for then, as I\nfear, music will give place to the questions "Why?" "What is the use of so\nmuch?" "How am I to get it?"--not a word of which will rhyme with what Radhika\nsang! So, as I was saying, illusion alone is real--it is the flute itself;\nwhile truth is but its empty hollow. Nikhil has of late got a taste of that\npure emptiness--one can see it in his face, which pains even me. But it was\nNikhil\'s boast that he wanted the Truth, while mine was that I would never let\ngo illusion from my grasp. Each has been suited to his taste, so why complain?\n\nTo keep Bimala\'s heart in the rarefied air of idealism, I cut short all\nfurther discussion over the five thousand rupees. I reverted to the demon-\ndestroying goddess and her worship. When was the ceremony to be held and\nwhere? There is a great annual fair at Ruimari, within Nikhil\'s estates, where\nhundreds of thousands of pilgrims assemble. That would be a grand place to\ninaugurate the worship of our goddess!\n\nBimala waxed intensely enthusiastic. This was not the burning of foreign cloth\nor the people\'s granaries, so even Nikhil could have no objection--so thought\nshe. But I smiled inwardly. How little these two persons, who have been\ntogether, day and night, for nine whole years, know of each other! They know\nsomething perhaps of their home life, but when it comes to outside concerns\nthey are entirely at sea. They had cherished the belief that the harmony of\nthe home with the outside was perfect. Today they realize to their cost that\nit is too late to repair their neglect of years, and seek to harmonize them\nnow.\n\nWhat does it matter? Let those who have made the mistake learn their error by\nknocking against the world. Why need I bother about their plight? For the\npresent I find it wearisome to keep Bimala soaring much longer, like a captive\nballoon, in regions ethereal. I had better get quite through with the matter\nin hand.\n\nWhen Bimala rose to depart and had neared the door I remarked in my most\ncasual manner: "So, about the money ..."\n\nBimala halted and faced back as she said: "On the expiry of the month, when\nour personal allowances become due ..."\n\n"That, I am afraid, would be much too late."\n\n"When do you want it then?"\n\n"Tomorrow.\n\n"Tomorrow you shall have it."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[20](hw31.htm#fr_19) A line from Bankim Chatterjee\'s national song _Bande\nMataram_.\n\n[21](hw31.htm#fr_20) A quotation from the Upanishads.\n\n[22](hw31.htm#fr_21) There is a world of sentiment attached to the ornaments\nworn by women in Bengal.\n\nThey are not merely indicative of the love and regard of the giver, but the\nwearing of them symbolizes all that is held best in wifehood--the constant\nsolicitude for her husband\'s welfare, the successful performance of the\nmaterial and spiritual duties of the household entrusted to her care. When the\nhusband dies, and the responsibility for the household changes hands, then are\nall ornaments cast aside as a sign of the widow\'s renunciation of worldly\nconcerns. At any other time the giving up of omaments is always a sign of\nsupreme distress and as such appeals acutely to the sense of chivalry of any\nBengali who may happen to witness it [Trans.].\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X](hw32.htm)\n\n'
