She replied: 'It is Brahman. It is through the victory of Brahman that you\nhave thus become great.' After that he knew that it was Brahman.\n\n2\\. Therefore these Devas, viz. Agni, Vayu, and Indra, are, as it were, above\nthe other gods, for they touched it (the Brahman) nearest 2.\n\n3\\. And therefore Indra is, as it were, above the other gods, for he touched\nit nearest, he first knew it.\n\n4\\. This is the teaching of Brahman, with regard to the gods (mythological):\nIt is that which now\n\np. 152\n\nflashes forth in the lightning, and now vanishes again.\n\n5\\. And this is the teaching of Brahman, with regard to the body\n(psychological): It is that which seems to move as mind, and by it imagination\nremembers again and again 1.\n\n6\\. That Brahman is called Tadvana 2, by the name of Tadvana it is to be\nmeditated on. All beings have a desire for him who knows this.\n\n7\\. The Teacher: 'As you have asked me to tell you the Upanishad, the\nUpanishad has now\n\np. 153\n\nbeen told you. We have told you the Brahmi Upanishad.\n\n8\\. 'The feet on which that Upanishad stands are penance, restraint,\nsacrifice; the Vedas are all its limbs 1, the True is its abode.\n\n9\\. 'He who knows this Upanishad, and has shaken off all evil, stands in the\nendless, unconquerable 2 world of heaven, yea, in the world of heaven.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[151:2](sbe01179.htm#fr_374) The next phrase was borrowed from \xc2\xa7 3, without\neven changing the singular to the plural. As Indra only found out that it was\nBrahman, the original distinction between Indra and the other gods, who only\ncame near to it, was quite justified. Still it might be better to adopt the\nvar. lect. sa hy etat in \xc2\xa7 2.\n\n[152:1](sbe01179.htm#fr_375) I have translated these paragraphs very\ndifferently from _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara and other interpreters. The wording is extremely\nbrief, and we can only guess the original intention of the Upanishad by a\nreference to other passages. Now the first teaching of Brahman, by means of a\ncomparison with the gods or heavenly things in general, seems to be that\nBrahman is what shines forth suddenly like lightning. Sometimes the relation\nbetween the phenomenal world and Brahman is illustrated by the relation\nbetween bubbles and the sea, or lightning and the unseen heavenly light (Mait.\nUp. V 1, 35). In another passage, _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 2, lightning, when no\nlonger seen, is to facilitate the conception of the reality of things, as\ndistinct from their perceptibility. I think, therefore, that the first simile,\ntaken from the phenomenal world, was meant to show that Brahman is that which\nappears for a moment in the lightning, and then vanishes from our sight.\n\nThe next illustration is purely psychological. Brahman is proved to exist,\nbecause our mind moves towards things, because there is something in us which\nmoves and perceives, and because there is something in us which holds our\nperceptions together (sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa), and revives them again by memory.\n\nI give my translation as hypothetical only, for certainty is extremely\ndifficult to attain, when we have to deal with these enigmatical sayings\nwhich, when they were first delivered, were necessarily accompanied by oral\nexplanations.\n\n[152:2](sbe01179.htm#fr_376) Tadvana, as a name of Brahman, is explained by\n'the desire of it,' and derived from van, to desire, the same as va\xc3\xb1 _kh_.\n\n[153:1](sbe01179.htm#fr_377) It is impossible to adopt _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's first\nrendering, 'the Vedas and all the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas,' i.e. the six subsidiary doctrines.\nHe sees himself that sarva\xe1\xb9\x85gani stands in opposition to pratish _th_ a and\nayatana, but seeing Veda and A\xe1\xb9\x85ga together, no Brahman could help thinking of\nthe Veda\xe1\xb9\x85gas.\n\n[153:2](sbe01179.htm#fr_378) Might we read a _g_ yeye for _g_ yeye? cf. Satap.\nBrahm. XI, 5, 7, 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 1](sbe01180.htm)\n\n"
