Not inequality and cruelty, on account of there being regard; for so\n(Scripture) declares.\n\nIt must indeed be admitted that the Lord, who differs in nature from all other\nbeings, intelligent and non-intelligent,\n\np. 478\n\nand hence possesses powers unfathomable by thought, is capable of creating\nthis manifold world, although before creation he is one only and without\nparts. But the assumption of his having actually created the world would lay\nhim open to the charge of partiality, in so far as the world contains beings\nof high, middle, and low station--gods, men, animals, immovable beings; and to\nthat of cruelty, in so far as he would be instrumental in making his creatures\nexperience pain of the most dreadful kind.--The reply to this is 'not so, on\naccount of there being regard'; i.e. 'on account of the inequality of creation\ndepending on the deeds of the intelligent beings, gods, and so on, about to be\ncreated.'-- _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti alike declare that the connexion of the\nindividual souls with bodies of different kinds--divine, human, animal, and so\non--depends on the karman of those souls; compare 'He who performs good works\nbecomes good, he who performs bad works becomes bad. He becomes pure by pure\ndeeds, bad by bad deeds' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 5). In the same way the reverend\nPara _s_ ara declares that what causes the difference in nature and status\nbetween gods, men, and so on, is the power of the former deeds of the souls\nabout to enter into a new creation--'He (the Lord) is the operative cause only\nin the creation of new beings; the material cause is constituted by the\npotentialities of the beings to be created. The being to be embodied requires\nnothing but an operative cause; it is its own potentiality which leads its\nbeing into that condition of being (which it is to occupy in the new\ncreation).' Potentiality here means karman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 35. If it be said 'not so, on account of non-distinction of\ndeeds'...](sbe48204.htm)\n\n"
