But it is through mind alone, that the ills of mind can be\ncured and eradicated. Those who live in this world without attachment to\nworldly objects, like a duck in a pond, are the true conquerors of the mind.\nFor what are they--but vermin--those who cling to the objects of the senses,\nand taste not of the fruit of renunciation? One ought to rid the mind of all\nthoughts of ego, and fix it on the Soul Supreme, according to the teachings of\nthe Vedas (Four books of Wisdom), to attain complete bliss and harmony in\nlife.\n\n"Even as one thorn removes another thorn, so the higher mind of a man, will\nremove the\n\np. 50\n\nimpurities from the lower mind of man. To cleanse the mind of its defilements\nand desires is the first step on the high road to salvation, trodden by the\ngreat Saint and Sages.\n\n"When the mind that wavers and flickers like a flame in the wind, is steadied\nand made one-pointed, as it were, through desirelessness, then alone is the\nReal Truth that sustains the Universe made manifest in all its refulgent\nmajesty. May you tread this Sacred and Ancient Path (Yoga), O Ram, and by\nknowing the true nature of your own self, and freeing your mind from all\nworldly entanglements, attain to the highest bliss of salvation. May your\nmind, freed from hankerings and longings for the objects of the world, be\nmerged in God-Consciousness. Past, present and future become as one, to he who\nhas controlled his mind, and conquered his worldly desires. When all the\nshining tinsel of the world becomes a mere nothing. then alone is mind\nconquered. These thoughts of attachment and possession,--that this is mine,\nthat is thine, etc., belong to the realm of the lower mind. When all such\nlower thoughts of differentiation are lost, and the Atma, One behind\n\np. 51\n\nall, is recognized, then alone the sorrows of the world cease to exist. May\nyou, O Ram, attain to that Divine State. When the mind is fully controlled and\nthe desires arising from it are destroyed, then alone comes surcease from\npains and afflictions that torment humanity. When the baser passions of the\nmind are slain, then one attains perfect peace, and becomes, as it were, the\nfountain head of peace in the world for the salvation of suffering humanity.\n\n"By meditating on the heart, spiritual Wisdom awakens, all doubts vanish, and\nthe mind is contented. This mind of ours, is susceptible to all kinds of\ninfluences, hankering after [worldly](errata.htm#2) pleasures, and this is the\ngreatest obstacle in the path of salvation. Control your. mind with the\nthought that these worldly objects are the merest tinsel compared to the\nliberation which is a veritable treasure-trove of all bliss and happiness.\nThen will you be freed from all worldly thoughts of possession and\ndifferentiation, arising from an overgrown ego.\n\nThe Divine State of liberation, where one is freed from the cycle of birth and\ndeath, confers untold bliss, and is everlasting like the Eternal One Himself.\n\np. 52\n\n"It is indeed hard to find in this world, a mind really free from the snare of\nthe senses. To control this ever-fluctuating mind and make it one-pointed is\nthe aim of all meditation, and is the theme of all discourses on metaphysics.\nConstant meditation on the One Unchanging Reality of the Universe, which is\nGod, the Self Supreme. The mind takes on the qualities it meditates upon. For\nthat reason the wise keep within strict control, those tendencies of the mind\nwhich incline it toward the baser objects, and in the end attain the Bliss of\ncomplete freedom, liberation, or Nirvana.\n\n"The moment desires and distractions crop up in the mind, they should be\nweeded out. The destruction of sensuous desires is akin to the destruction of\nignorance. Desirelessness leads to the peace of salvation. Constant effort is\nnecessary to attain such bliss. With the realization of the Supreme and\nSustaining Reality of the Universe, one sees that all worldly objects are\nfalse and unreal to the core,--mere illusions, nothing else, like bubbles on\nthe deep."\n\nPrince Ram asked: "Tell us, O Saint, how one can destroy ignorance?"\n\np. 53\n\nRishi Vashisht, the Preceptor, replied; "Through ignorance it is, O Ram, that\nthe Atma, which is eternal, is forced to go though the cycle of births and\ndeaths. To conceive of the illusion, which besets the embodied soul as real,\nis ignorance, and a barrier to seeing true reality. A man, free from births\nand deaths, and realizing the all-refulgent reality of the Universe, perceives\nthat desires are a creation of Maya. Extinction of lower desires is the\nextinction of ignorance."\n\nPrince Ram asked his preceptor, the Holy Vashisht: "All visible objects of\nname and form, O Lord, you say are illusions, and that illusion is destroyed\nby meditation on the true reality of the Atma. Pray, what is this thing called\nAtma?"\n\nRishi Vashisht replied: "It is the Wisdom of the Brahma (God), who has no\nvisible form. All things of the world, perceived through our senses, contain\nthe essence of Brahma, such as growth, mind, birth and death, which are\nillusory, not real. Brahma alone is true and self-existent, the Creator and\nUpholder of the Universe. Out of that Supreme Soul, which is Eternal,\nImmortal, and Absolute, arose the intelligence that governs\n\np. 54\n\nthe Universe. This Atmic Jnan is the Absolute Self shining every where.\n\n"From the Brahma arise different forces and powers like waves and currents in\nthe ocean. To realize Oneself as Brahma is the goal; but to know the soul as\ndistinct from the body is to know the truth and be free from ignorance. It is\nonly the fancy of fools, that gives illusion the garb of reality. The wise\nhave pierced the veil of illusion by the shafts of their Jnan (Wisdom). Know\nthen, this body, this wealth, these kith and kin are not real. Atma alone is\nreal and eternal. Perform actions in this world without being absorbed by\nthem."\n\nSri Ram then said: "How marvelous it is that illusion, which is unreal, should\ncause so much pain and suffering in the world, and that which appears so solid\nand concrete should be but a manifestation of Maya. O Master, I cannot believe\nthis Universe really came out of the unreality. How do you account for the\npains of King Lavana?"\n\nSaint Vashisht answered: "King Lavana was not bound by the results of his\nactions, as he performed them without attachment, and with complete\nindifference to the outcome. One morning\n\np. 55\n\nwhile sitting in solitude, the King fell into a profound reverie and thought\nof performing mentally the Raj-suya Vajna, as performed by his powerful\nancestor Harish Chandra. He thought of all the accessories to the Sacrifice,\nand in imagination offered oblations to the gods, and went through all the\ndetails of the sacrifice. When he awoke from his reverie, it was night-fall.\nIt is a rule that whoever performs the Royal Sacrifice, must undergo great\npain and suffering. So the King of the gods, Indra, sent a celestial messenger\nto inflict suffering on King Lavana. The mendicant, who appeared before the\nKing, and put him into a trance in which he suffered cruelly, was none other\nthan Indra\'s messenger. This I discovered by my ascetic powers. So you will\nsee from this episode, that actions performed even mentally have far-reaching\nconsequences.\n\nThe story of King Lavana is as follows: A mendicant came to the Court of King\nLavana and besought him to witness has powers. On the King consenting, the\nmendicant waved a peacock feather before the King\'s face, and immediately the\nKing sank into unconsciousness, while his body writhed fearfully. When some\ntime later the King recovered consciousness, his minister asked him what he\n\np. 56\n\nhad experienced. The King replied "I felt dizzy when the mendicant waved the\nfan. Then I saw a horse coming toward me. On the mendicant\'s suggestion I rode\nthe horse and was carried away to a dense forest, where I fell from the horse\nand felt very thirsty. While I lay dying of thirst, I saw a young woman pass\nmy way with a pitcher of water. I asked for water, but the girl refused,\nsaying that she was low-born and could not give water to the King unless he\nmarried her and promised to live with her folks. In my extremity, I consented.\nI married the girl, but found it very hard to live with her folks, who were no\nbetter than barbarians. I moved up on the hill top and built a house. There I\nlived with the girl for eight years, and we had two sons. Then there was a\nsevere draught, and as a result, terrible famine. People died by the hundreds\nand thousands for want of food. I started, with my wife and sons, for some\nother land. On the way, my wife died from fatigue and exhaustion and my sons\ncried for food. Unable to see them suffer, I killed myself. Just at this point\nI recovered consciousness." So said the King, and all present marvelled at the\nstrangeness of the dream. They looked around for the ascetic but he was\nnowhere to be found.--by the Author.\n\n"O Ram," continued the Rishi Vashisht, "I will speak to you of the nature of\nJnan and Ajnana--Wisdom and Ignorance. Each of these is seven-fold in\ncharacter. Wisdom enables men to perceive the true reality of the Universe and\nthereby obtain salvation; whereas, ignorance, by\n\np. 57\n\nregarding the physical body as the real "I", leads to bondage.\n\n"Now, the difference between a seer and one who is denied spiritual vision.\nThe seers are those who have conquered illusions, and have awakened to a\nrealization of the true reality of the Universe. The ignorant slaves of\nillusion. Shallow human intelligence causes doubts and disbeliefs and leads\nmen astray. This is but delusion. Wisdom leaves no room for doubts or\ndisbeliefs. To the man who has attained true Wisdom, the human soul and the\nSupreme Soul becomes One.\n\n"The seven states of ignorance are Bindu-jagrat, Jagrat, Maha-jagrat,\nSwapnajagrat, Swapuna, Sushupti, Bindu-jagrat is the primary state of partial\nperception. In the second state the individual begins to perceive the\ndifference of mine, thine and his. In the third state the man begins to have\nsome conception of the relationship between man and the Universe. In the\nfourth state the mind realizes its supremacy over matter. The fifth state is\nreally the dream state. In the sixth state the individual recalls to mind\nthings long past. In the seventh state the individual realizes the futility\n\np. 58\n\nof all his previous states, fraught with pain and suffering.\n\n\n\n"There are likewise seven states of Wisdom, although any number of divisions\nand subdivisions can be made. These seven states of Wisdom lead to Nirvana.\nThey are Subeccha or right desire, Vicharan or contemplation, Tanumansi, the\nstate in which the mind is alert, Satwapatti or the generation of the serenity\nof the mind, Asansakti or detachment of the mind from [worldly](errata.htm#3)\nthings, Padarth Bhavana, the perception of the truth and reality, and Turya or\nlight. These states free the seeker from delusion, and lead gradually to\ncomplete Nirvana or salvation and to the end of pain and suffering. Subhecha\nor right desire is of course the longing and desire for spiritual\nenlightenment. Vicharana is defined as meditation or contemplation of the\nthings of spirit and mind, contemplation of the Divinity that pervades the\nUniverse, and the realization of the Godhead, These two states lead to the\nthird stage of keen intellectual perception, which naturally leads to the real\ntruth or divine philosophy. Atma Jnan (Wisdom of the self) brings about\nemancipation\n\np. 59\n\nfrom the thraldom of worldly things. This state confers ineffable bliss and\nenlightenment on the seeker. By logical sequence in that state of advancement,\nthe student realizes his relationship with the Divine, and his relationship\nwith the Universe. here he sees, knows and understands all. Then the last\nstate of complete enlightenment and mastery is reached, when the very presence\nof the man radiates spiritual light. Such a soul is free from the cycle of\nbirth and death. He is called Jivan-mukta (bodily emancipated). These souls\nare free indeed. Free front worldly longings and desires, pleasure, pair,\nsuccess, failure, praise, blame, profit, loss, victory and defeat are as one\nto them. They have attained salvation by the continued discipline of their\nmind, by unceasing effort in the realm of divine philosophy.\n\n"Rising by degrees from one spiritual stage of enlightenment to another, until\nhaving passed through the seven stages, you attain liberation. Those who have\nsubjected their mind and acquired true perception of the Divine within, are\ntruly great, worthy of every respect, and adoration. Others have to go through\ninnumerable births and deaths. One desire leading\n\np. 60\n\nto another, thus the wheels of Maya move on, and the soul is bound more and\nmore, until true awakening comes, and the man starts on the path of\nenlightenment. This path begins with the desire for spiritual light, and\nattains completion with acquirement of that light, by means of the seven\nstages described above. Such a one realizes Brahma and becomes one with\nBrahma, the first Cause of the Universe, the Source of Ineffable Bliss, the\nOcean of Power, the Sun of Spiritual Illumination, Immortal, Untreated, All-\npervading, All-seeing, All-knowing, All-powerful, Supreme Creator, Preserver\nand Destroyer of the Universe."\n\n\n\nRishi Vashisht continued: "O Ram, I will narrate further the story of King\nLavana to illustrate the working of the Maya. On recovering consciousness, the\nKing was seized with a great longing to visit the strange country he had\ndreamed of, so he started for the Vindhya mountains. and in due time reached\nthe impenetrable forest that cover its slopes.\n\n\n\nHe wandered about hither and thither unlit he reached the North, where he came\nupon a settlement of the very people he had dreamed\n\np. 61\n\nabout. And wonder of wonders, these people were actually suffering from famine\nand in a miserable plight. The King and his courtiers saw an old woman\nbewailing the loss of her children, who had died during the famine. As they\nlistened to her lament, they discovered with much surprise that the old woman\nwas weeping for the girl whom the King had married in his dream, by whom he\nhad two sons, and who had died while on the way to a land of plenty. Greatly\nmoved by the incident, the King pacified the old woman, giving she and her\ntribesmen food and clothing, and conducting them to his kingdom. He then\nsought an explanation of the mystery, at the feet of the learned. After due\ndiscipline, meditation, and study he attained the Bliss of Nirvana. It is\nthus, O Ram, O Ram, that illusion works and gives the unreal, the appearance\nof the real."\n\nRam asked: "How was it, O Master, that what the King saw in his dream actually\ncame to pass?"\n\nMuni Vashisht replied: "You will better understand this incident by the story\nof Gandhi, which I will narrate for your benefit later on. What happened in\nthis case was not really true,\n\np. 62\n\nonly a conjurer\'s trick played by Indra\'s messenger on the consciousness of\nthe King and those aborigines on the Vindhya Mountains. The King experienced\nin his unconscious state, and the tribesmen saw in their conscious state, that\nwas all. But that is how illusion works, tricking us into believing as real\nthat which is not, piercing the veil of illusion, O Ram, by the shining shaft\nof Jnan (Wisdom of the self). May you attain that state of bliss, my son, in\nwhich the human soul becomes one with the Divine--the state of complete\nNirvana. May you realize the Divinity within you, and know it to be the same\nthat brought the world into being and pervades and sustains it. Conquer, O\nRam, by ceaseless meditation, the ignorance of illusion, and attain the One\nOmnipotent and Omniscient God, from whom the world evolved, and in whom it\nresolves itself."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Queen Chundalai, The Great Yogin](yvhf08.htm)\n\n'
