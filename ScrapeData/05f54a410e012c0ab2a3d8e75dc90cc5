The Kurma Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n15\\. Kurma Puran\xcc\x81a. "That in which Janarddana, in the form of a tortoise, in\nthe regions under the earth, explained the objects of life--duty, wealth,\npleasure, and liberation--in communication with Indradyumna and the Rishis in\nthe proximity of \xc5\x9aakra, which refers to the Lakshmi Kalpa, and contains\nseventeen thousand stanzas, is the Kurma Puran\xcc\x81a 76."\n\nIn the first chapter of the Kurma Puran\xcc\x81a it gives an account of itself, which\ndoes not exactly agree with this description. Suta, who is repeating the\nnarration, is made to say to the Rishis, "This most excellent Kaurma Puran\xcc\x81a\nis the fifteenth. Sanhitas are fourfold, from the variety of the collections.\nThe Brahmi, Bhagavati, Sauri, and Vaishn\xcc\x81avi, are well known as the four\nSanhitas which confer virtue, wealth, pleasure, and liberation. This is the\nBrahmi Sanhita, conformable to the four Vedas; in which there are six thousand\n\xc5\x9blokas, and by it the importance of the four objects of life, O great sages,\nholy knowledge and Parame\xc5\x9bwara is known." There is an irreconcilable\ndifference in this specification of the number of stanzas and that given\nabove. It is not very clear what is meant by a Sanhita as here used. A\nSanhita, as observed above (p. xi), is something different from a Puran\xcc\x81a. It\nmay be an assemblage of prayers and legends, extracted professedly from a\nPuran\xcc\x81a, but is not usually applicable to the original. The four Sanhitas here\nspecified refer rather to their religious character than to their connexion\nwith any specific work, and in fact the same terms are applied to what are\ncalled Sanhitas of the Skanda. In this sense a Puran\xcc\x81a might be also a\nSanhita; that is, it might be an assemblage of formulae and legends belonging\nto a division of the Hindu system; and the work in question, like the Vishn\xcc\x81u\nPuran\xcc\x81a, does adopt both titles. It says, "This is the excellent Kaurma\nPuran\xcc\x81a, the fifteenth (of the series):" and again, "This is the Brahmi\nSanhita." At any rate, no other work has been met with pretending to be the\nKurma Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\np. l\n\nWith regard to the other particulars specified by the Matsya, traces of them\nare to be found. Although in two accounts of the traditional communication of\nthe Puran\xcc\x81a no mention is made of Vishn\xcc\x81u as one of the teachers, yet Suta\nrepeats at the outset a dialogue between Vishn\xcc\x81u, as the Kurma, and\nIndradyumna, at the time of the churning of the ocean; and much of the\nsubsequent narrative is put into the mouth of the former.\n\nThe name, being that of an Avatara of Vishn\xcc\x81u, might lead us to expect a\nVaishn\xcc\x81ava work; but it is always and correctly classed with the \xc5\x9aaiva.\nPuran\xcc\x81as, the greater portion of it inculcating the worship of \xc5\x9aiva and Durga.\nIt is divided into two parts, of nearly equal length. In the first part,\naccounts of the creation, of the Avataras of Vishn\xcc\x81u, of the solar and lunar\ndynasties of the kings to the time of Krishn\xcc\x81a, of the universe, and of the\nManwantaras, are given, in general in a summary manner, but not unfrequently\nin the words employed in the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a. With these are blended hymns\naddressed to Mahe\xc5\x9bwara by Brahma and others; the defeat of Andhakasura by\nBhairava; the origin of four \xc5\x9aaktis, Mahe\xc5\x9bwari, \xc5\x9aiva, \xc5\x9aati, and Haimavati,\nfrom \xc5\x9aiva; and other \xc5\x9aaiva legends. One chapter gives a more distinct and\nconnected account of the incarnations of \xc5\x9aiva in the present age than the\nLinga; and it wears still more the appearance of an attempt to identify the\nteachers of the Yoga school with personations of their preferential deity.\nSeveral chapters form a Ka\xc5\x9bi Mahatmya, a legend of Benares. In the second part\nthere are no legends. It is divided into two parts, the \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara Gita 77 and\nVyasa Gita. In the former the knowledge of god, that is, of \xc5\x9aiva, through\ncontemplative devotion, is taught. In the latter the same object is enjoined\nthrough works, or observance of the ceremonies and precepts of the Vedas.\n\nThe date of the Kurma Puran\xcc\x81a cannot be very remote, for it is avowedly\nposterior to the establishment of the Tantrika, the Sakta, and the Jain sects.\nIn the twelfth chapter it is said, "The Bhairava, Vama, \xc3\x81rhata, and Yamala\n\xc5\x9aastras are intended for delusion." There is no\n\np. li\n\nreason to believe that the Bhairava and Yamala Tantras are very ancient works,\nor that the practices of the left-hand \xc5\x9aaktas, or the doctrines of Arhat or\nJina were known in the early centuries of our era.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xlix:76](vp019.htm#fr_75) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_04900.jpg)\n\n[l:77](vp019.htm#fr_76) This is also translated by Col.
