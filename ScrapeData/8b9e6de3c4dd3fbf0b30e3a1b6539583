When he has chosen the _Ri_ tvi _g_ as, he should offer the Madhuparka\n(i.e. honey-mixture) to them (in the way described in Sutras 5 and following);\n\n2\\. To a Snataka, when he comes to his house;\n\n3\\. And to a king;\n\n4\\. And for a teacher, the father-in-law, a paternal uncle, and a maternal\nuncle.\n\n5\\. He pours honey into curds,\n\n6\\. Or butter, if he can get no honey.\n\n7\\. A seat, the water for washing the feet, the Arghya water (i.e. perfumed\nwater into which flowers have been thrown), the water for sipping, the honey-\nmixture,\n\np. 198\n\na cow: every one of these things they announce three times (to the guest).\n\n8\\. With (the verse), 'I am the highest one among my people, as the sun among\nthe thunderbolts. Here I tread on him whosoever infests me'\xc2\x97he should sit down\non the seat (made of) northward-pointed (grass).\n\n9\\. Or (he should do so) after he has trodden on it.\n\n10\\. He should make (his host) wash his feet.\n\n11\\. The right foot he should stretch out first to a Brahma _n_ a,\n\n12\\. The left to a _S_ udra.\n\n13\\. When his feet have been washed, he receives the Arghya water in the\nhollow of his joined hands and then sips the water destined thereto, with (the\nformula), 'Thou art the first layer for Ambrosia.'\n\n14\\. He looks at the Madhuparka when it is brought to him, with (the formula),\n'I look at thee with Mitra's eye.'\n\n15\\. He accepts it with his joined hands with (the formula), 'By the impulse\nof the god Savitri, with the arms of the two A _s_ vins, with the hands of\nPushan I accept thee.' He then takes it into his left hand, looks at it with\nthe three verses, 'Honey the winds to the righteous one' (Rig-veda I, 90, 6\nseqq.), stirs it about three times from left to right with the fourth finger\nand the thumb, and wipes (his fingers) with (the formula), 'May the Vasus eat\nthee with the Gayatri metre'\xc2\x97to the east;\n\n16\\. With (the formula), 'May the Rudras eat thee with the Trish _t_ ubh\nmetre'\xc2\x97to the south;\n\n17\\. With (the formula), 'May the \xc3\x82dityas eat thee with the _G_ agati\nmetre'\xc2\x97to the west;\n\np. 199\n\n18\\. With (the formula), 'May the Vi _s_ ve devas eat thee with the Anush _t_\nubh metre'\xc2\x97to the north.\n\n19\\. With (the formula), 'To the beings thee'\xc2\x97he three times takes (some of\nthe Madhuparka substance) out of the middle of it.\n\n20\\. With (the formula), 'The milk of Vira _g_ art thou'\xc2\x97he should partake\nthereof the first time,\n\n21\\. With, 'The milk of Vira _g_ may I obtain'\xc2\x97the second time,\n\n22 22. With, 'In me (may) the milk of Padya Vira _g_ (dwell)'\xc2\x97the third time.\n\n23\\. (He should) not (eat) the whole (Madhuparka).\n\n24\\. He should not satiate himself.\n\n25\\. To a Brahma _n_ a, to the north, he should give the remainder.\n\n26\\. If that cannot be done, (he should throw it) into water.\n\n27\\. Or (he may eat) the whole (Madhuparka).\n\n28 28. He then makes a rinsing of his mouth follow (on the eating of the\nMadhuparka) with the water destined thereto, with (the formula), 'Thou art the\ncovering of Ambrosia.'\n\n29\\. With (the formula), 'Truth! Glory! Fortune! May fortune rest on me!'\xc2\x97a\nsecond time.\n\n30\\. When he has sipped water, they announce to him the cow.\n\n31\\. Having murmured, 'Destroyed is my sin; my sin is destroyed,' (he says,)\n'Om, do it,' if he chooses to have her killed.\n\n32\\. Having murmured, 'The mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus'\n(Rig-veda VIII, 101, 15),\n\np. 200\n\n[paragraph continues] (he says,) 'Om, let her loose,' if he chooses to let her\nloose.\n\n33 33. Let the Madhuparka not be without flesh, without flesh.\n\nEnd of the First Adhyaya.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[197:1](sbe29123.htm#fr_481) 24, 1 seqq.
