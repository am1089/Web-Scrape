Exorcism of disease by means of an amulet from the varana-tree.\n\n1\\. This divine tree, the varana, shall shut out (varayatai). The gods, too,\nhave shut out (avivaran) the disease that hath entered into this man!  \n2\\. By Indra's command, by Mitra's and by Varuna's, by the command of all the\ngods do we shut out thy disease.  \n3\\. As Vritra did bold fast these ever-flowing waters, thus do I shut out\n(varaye) disease from thee with (the help of) Agni Vaisvanara.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 127.
