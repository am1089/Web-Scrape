(Having true) wishes and other (qualities) (have to be combined) there\nand here, on account of the abode and so on.\n\nIn the chapter of the _Kh_ andogya which begins with the passage, 'There is\nthis city of Brahman and in it the palace, the small lotus, and in it that\nsmall ether' (VIII, 1, 1), we read, 'That is the Self free from sin, free from\nold age, from death and grief, from hunger and thirst, whose desires are true,\nwhose imaginations are true.' A similar passage is found in the text of the Va\n_g_ asaneyins, 'He is that great unborn Self who consists of knowledge, is\nsurrounded by the Pra _n_ as, the ether within the heart. In it there reposes\nthe ruler of all' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22).\n\nA doubt here arises whether these two passages constitute one vidya, and\nwhether the particulars stated in one text are to be comprehended within the\nother text also.\n\nThere is oneness of vidya 1.--Here (the Sutrakara) says, 'Wishes and so on'\ni.e. 'The quality of having true wishes and so on' (the word kama standing for\nsatyakama, just\n\np. 248\n\nas people occasionally say Datta for Devadatta and Bhama for Satyabhama). This\nquality and the other qualities, which the _Kh_ andogya attributes to the\nether within the heart, have to be combined with the Va _g_ asaneyaka-passage,\nand vice versa the qualities stated in the Va _g_ asaneyaka, such as being the\nruler of all, have also to be ascribed to the Self free from sin, proclaimed\nin the _Kh_ andogya. The reason for this is that the two passages display a\nnumber of common features. Common to both is the heart viewed as abode, common\nagain is the Lord as object of knowledge, common also is the Lord being viewed\nas a bank preventing these worlds from being confounded; and several other\npoints.--But, an objection is raised, there are also differences. In the _Kh_\nandogya the qualities are attributed to the ether within the heart, while in\nthe Va _g_ asaneyaka they are ascribed to Brahman abiding in that ether.--This\nobjection, we reply, is unfounded, for we have shown under I, 3, 14 that the\nterm 'ether' in the _Kh_ andogya designates Brahman.\n\nThere is, however, the following difference between the two passages. The _Kh_\nandogya-vidya has for its object the qualified Brahman, as we see from the\npassage VIII, 1, 6, 'But those who depart from hence after having discovered\nthe Self and those true desires,' in which certain desires are represented as\nobjects of knowledge equally as the Self. In the Va _g_ asaneyaka, on the\nother hand, the highest Brahman devoid of all qualities forms the object of\ninstruction, as we conclude from the consideration of the request made by _G_\nanaka, 'Speak on for the sake of emancipation,' and the reply given by Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, 'For that person is not attached to anything' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3,\n14; 15). That the text ascribes to the Self such qualities as being the Lord\nof all and the like is (not for the purpose of teaching that the Self really\npossesses those qualities, but is) merely meant to glorify the Self. Later on\nalso (IV, 5, 15) the chapter winds up with a passage clearly referring to the\nSelf devoid of all qualities, 'That Self is to be described by No, no!' But as\nthe qualified Brahman is (fundamentally) one (with the unqualified Brahman),\nwe\n\np. 249\n\nmust conclude that the Sutra teaches the combination of the qualities to the\nend of setting forth the glory of Brahman, not for the purpose of devout\nmeditation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[247:1](sbe38182.htm#fr_156) This clause must apparently be taken as stating\nthe siddhanta-view, although later on it is said that the two vidyas are\ndistinct (that, however, in spite of their distinctness, their details have to\nbe combined).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 40](sbe38183.htm)\n\n"
