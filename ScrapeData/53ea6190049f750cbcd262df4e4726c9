Those (qualities which are attributed to the subject of a vidya in one\n_S_ akha only) (are to be inserted) in other places (also), since (the vidyas)\nare non-different on the whole.\n\nIn the colloquy of the pra _n_ as recorded by the Va _g_ asaneyins and the\n_Kh_ andogas the pra _n_ a, endowed with various qualities such as being the\nbest and so on, is represented as the object of meditation, and various\nqualities such as being the richest and the like are ascribed to speech and\nthe other organs. And these latter qualities are in the end attributed to the\npra _n_ a also, 'If I am the richest thou art the richest,' &c. Now in other\n_S_ akhas also, as e.g. that of the Kaushitakins, the former set of qualities\nsuch as being the best and so on is ascribed to the pra _n_ a (cp. Kau. Up.\nII, 14, 'Now follows the Ni _h_ _s_ reyasadana,' &c.), but at the same time\nthe latter set of attributes, viz. being the richest and so on, is not\nmentioned.--The question then is whether those qualities which are mentioned\nin some places only are, for the purposes of meditation, to be inserted there\nalso where nothing is said about them.\n\nThey are not so to be inserted, the purvapakshin maintains, on account of the\nemployment of the word 'thus.' In the Kaushitakin-text we meet with the\nclause, 'He who knows thus, having recognised the pre-eminence in pra _n_ a.'\nNow the word 'thus' which here indicates the object of knowledge always refers\nto something mentioned not far off, and cannot therefore denote a set of\nqualities mentioned in other _S_ akhas only. We therefore maintain that each\nof the colloquies of the pra _n_ as must be considered complete with the\nqualities stated in itself.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. The qualities mentioned in one text are\nto be inserted in the other corresponding texts also, 'Since on the whole they\nare non-different,' i.e. because the pra _n_ a-vidyas are recognised to be the\nsame in all essential points. And if they are the same,\n\np. 201\n\nwhy should the qualities stated in one not be inserted in the others also?--\nBut how about the objection founded by the purvapakshin on the employment of\nthe word 'thus?'--Although it is true, we reply, that the word 'thus' in the\nKaushtiakin-brahma _n_ a does not denote the set of qualities mentioned in the\nVa _g_ asaneyin-brahma _n_ a, yet that set of qualities is denoted by the\n'thus' met within the Va _g_ asaneyin-brahma _n_ a, while the vidya is, as\nproved by us, one and the same; hence no difference has to be made between\nqualities mentioned in one's own _S_ akha and qualities mentioned in another\n_S_ akha, as long as the vidya is one and the same. Nor does this by any means\nimply a disregard of the text of scripture, and the assumption of things not\nwarranted by the text. The qualities declared in one _S_ akha are valid for\nall scripture as long as the thing to which the qualities belong is the same.\nDevadatta, who in his own country is known to possess valour and certain other\nqualities, does not lose those qualities by going to a foreign land, although\nthe inhabitants of that land may know nothing about them. And through better\nacquaintance his qualities will become manifest to the people of the foreign\ncountry also. Similarly the qualities stated in one _S_ akha may, through\nspecial application, be inserted in another _S_ akha.--Hence the attributes\nbelonging to one and the same subject have to be combined wherever that\nsubject is referred to, although they may be expressly stated in one place\nonly.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 11](sbe38154.htm)\n\n"
