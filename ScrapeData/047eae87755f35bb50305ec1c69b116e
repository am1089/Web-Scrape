Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! What is that great Yaj\xc3\xb1a (sacrifice)\nnamed Amba Yaj\xc3\xb1a about which you referred just now? Who is the Amba? Where was\nShe born? From whom and what for did Her birth take place? What are Her\nqualities? What is Her form and nature? O Ocean of mercy! You are all-knowing;\nkindly describe everything duly. Along with this, describe in detail the\norigin of Brahmanda. O Brahma _n_ a! You know every thing of this whole\nUniverse. I heard that Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Rudra are the three Devatas, who\nare successively originated to create, preserve, and destroy this Universe.\nAre these three highsouled entities independent? or Do they do their\nrespective duties, being subservient to another Person? Now I am very eager to\nknow all these. So Paras'ara's son! Describe all these to me. Are these highly\npowerful Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'vara subject to Death like ordinary\nbeings? Or are they of the nature of everlasting Existence, Intelligence and\nBliss? Are they subject to the three fold pains arising from their own selves\nfrom elements and from those arising from gods? Are they subject Time? How and\nwherefrom were they originated? Do they feel the influence of pleasure, pain,\nsleep or laziness? O Muni! Do their bodies consist of seven Dhatus? (blood,\netc.) or are they of some other kinds? A great doubt has arisen in me on all\nthese points. If these bodies be not made up of five elements, then of what\nsubstance are they built of? And of what gu _n_ as are their senses built\nalso? How do they enjoy objects of enjoyments? How long is their longevity? O\nBrahma _n_ a! where do they, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahes'vara, the best of\nthe gods live? And of what nature are their powers and prosperities? I like\nvery much to hear all these. So describe all these in detail to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n11-24. Vyasa said :-- \xc2\x93O highly intelligent king! The questions that you have\nasked me today whence and how Brahma, etc., were born ? etc., are\n\n\n\np. 120\n\n\n\nvery difficult. In ancient days, once, on an occasion, I asked many questions\nlike you to the Muni Narada. At first he was greatly suprised to hear my\nqueries, afterwards he gave due replies to them. O king! I will answer to you\nin the same way; listen. Once I saw that the all-knowing, peaceful Narada, the\nknower of the Vedas was sitting on the banks of the Ganges. I became very glad\nand fell at his feet. By his order I took one excellent seat. Hearing, then,\nof his welfare and seeing him sitting on the sands I asked him :-- \xc2\x93O highly\nintelligent One! Who is the Supreme Architect of this widely extended\nUniverse? Whence is this Brahmanda born? Is it eternal or temporary? When it\nis an effect, then it is natural that it cannot be created without a cause.\nNow when the cause, the creator, is certain, is he one or many? O sage! as\nregards this wide Samsara, I have expressed my doubt; now answer me what is\nthe Real and True, and thus remove my doubts. Many believe Maha Deva, the Lord\nof all the other Devas as the Supreme God, the Cause of all. He is the source\nof deliverance to all the Jivas; devoid of birth and death; always auspicious;\npeaceful in Himself and the controller of the three gu _n_ as. He is the one\nand only cause of creation, preservation and destruction. Some Pundits believe\nVi _sn_ u as the God of all and praise Him as such. It is Vi _sn_ u that is\nthe powerful Supreme Self, the Lord of all and the First Person \xc3\x82dipuru _s_ a.\nIt is He that has no birth nor death, the Deliverer of the whole Jivas,\nOmnipresent; His faces are everywhere; He is the Granter of enjoyments and\nliberation to the devotees. Some others call again Brahma, the Cause of all.\nIt is He that is omniscient and the Stimulator of all beings.\n\n\n\nThe four-faced Brahma, the best of all the Devas is born from the navel lotus\nof some One of endless force. He resides in Satyaloka; He is the Creator of\nall and the Lord of all the Devas. Again some other Pundits call the Sun,\nSurya as God. In the morning and in the evening they chant His hymns, without\nany lack of slackness and laziness. Again there are some others, who say that\nIndra is the lord of all the Jivas; He is thousand-eyed; it is Indra, the\nhusband of S\xc2\x92achi, that is the God of all. Those who perform Yaj\xc3\xb1as\n(sacrifices) worship Vasava, the king of the Devas. He drinks Soma juice\nHimself and those who drink Soma are his beloved. He is the one and only Lord\nof Sacrifices. Thus all men worship, according to their respective wishes,\nVaru _n_ a, Soma, Agni, Pavana (wind), Yama (the god of Death), Kuvera, the\nlord of wealth; there are some again who worship the elephant-faced Ga _n_\napati, the Fructifier of all actions, the Granter of desires of all the\ndevotees, and the Giver of success to all in all enterprises, no sooner He is\nremembered. Some \xc3\x82charyas (professors) say again that the All auspicious the\n\xc3\x82di Maya, the Great S\xc2\x92akti Bhavani, the Giver of everything, Who is the nature\nof with and without attributes\n\n\n\np. 121\n\n\n\nWho is not different from Brahma, who is both Puru _s_ a and Prakriti, the\nCreatrix, the Preservatrix and the Destructrix of all, the Mother of all the\ngods, beings and lokas, is the Great Goddess of this Brahma _n_ da. She is\nwithout beginning and end, full, present in all the beings and everywhere. It\nis this Bhavani that assumes the various endless forms such as Vaisnavi\nS\xc2\x92ankari, Brahmi, Vasavi, Varu _n_ i, Varahi, Nara Simhi, Maha Lak _s_ mi the\none and secondless Vedamata, and others. It is this Vidya nature that is the\nOne and the only Root of this tree of Samsara (universe).\n\n\n\nThe mere act of remembering Her destroys heaps of afflictions of the devotees\nand fulfills all their desires. She gives Mok _s_ a to those who are desirous\nof liberation and gives rewards to those who want such. She is beyond the\nthree Gu _n_ as and still She emanates them. Therefore the Yogis that want\nrewards meditate Her, Who is of the nature of Vidya and Who is devoid of\nattributes. The best Munis, the knowers of the truths of Vedanta meditate on\nHer as formless, immutable, stainless, omnipresent Brahma devoid of all\nDharma. She is described in some Vedas and Upanishads as full of Light\n(Tejas). Some intelligent persons describe God as of infinite hands, infinite\nears, infinite legs, infinite faces, peaceful, Vira _t_ Puru _s_ a and\ndescribe sky as the Pada (place) of Vi _sn_ u. Other knowers of the Pura _n_\nas describe Him as Puru _s_ ottama. There are some others again who declare\nthat this creation cannot be done by a single individual. Some atheists say\nthat this inconceivable infinite Universe can never be created by one God. So\nthere is no such definite God that can be called its Creator. Though without\nany creator, this Brahma _n_ da is sprung from the Nature and conducted by\nHer. The followers of the Samkhya system say that Puru _s_ a is not the\ncreator of this Universe; they declare that Prakriti is the Mistress of this\nUniverse O Muni! Thus I have expressed to you what the Muni Kapila, the\nAcharya of the Sankhyas and the other philosophers declare as their opinions;\nvarious doubts, thus, reign always in my breast. Owing to these doubts my mind\nis so confused that I cannot arrive at any definite conclusion. My mind is\nvery much unsettled as to what is Dharma and what is Adharma. What are the\ncharacteristics of Dharma? I cannot make out them. For the Devas are all\nsprung from the Sattva Gu _n_ a and are always attached to the true Dharma;\nyet they are frequently troubled by the sinful Danavas. How, then, can I place\nmy confidence on the permanence of the Dharma? My forefathers, the Pa _nd_\navas were always endowed with good behaviours and good actions and they\nremained always in the path of the Dharma; yet they suffered a good deal of\ntroubles and sufferings. In these cases it is very difficult understand the\ngreatness of Dharma. So, O Father! Seeing all these, my mind is thrown into a\nsea of doubts and troubles. O Great Muni!\n\n\n\np. 122\n\n\n\nThere is nothing impracticable with you; so remove my doubts. O Muni! I am\nalways plunged and raised and plunged again in this sea of delusion. So save\nme by lifting me on a boat of wisdom and carry me across this ocean of samsara\n(this world).\n\n\n\nThus ends the first chapter on the third Skandha on the questions put by\nJanamejaya in the Mahapura _n_ a S'rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyas.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk03ch02.htm)\n\n"
