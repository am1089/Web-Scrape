It is stated that day was first and then night; that months\nhave the bright 5 first, the Nakshatras _S_ ravana 6 as the first (among\nthem), and the seasons the winter as the first (among them). The earth is the\nsource 7 of smells, water of tastes, the light (of) the sun is the source of\ncolours, the wind is stated to be the source of (the feelings of) touch;\nlikewise space is the source of sound. These are the qualities of the\nelements. Now I shall proceed to state the highest and first of all entities.\nThe sun is\n\np. 353\n\nthe first among shining bodies 1; fire is said to be the first of the elements\n2; Savitri 3 of all branches of learning; Pra _g_ apati of deities; the\nsyllable Om of all the Vedas; and the Pra _n_ a life-wind, of all words 4;\nwhatever is prescribed in this world, all that is called Savitri 5. The\nGayatri is the first among metres; among (sacrificial) animals, the goat 6 is\nmentioned (as the first). Cows are the first among quadrupeds, and the twice-\nborn among men 7. The _S_ yena is first among birds; among sacrifices, the\noffering (into the fire) is the best; and among all reptiles, O best of the\ntwice-born! the snake 8 is the highest. Of all ages the K _ri_ ta is the\nfirst, there is no doubt of that., Among all precious things, gold (is the\nfirst),and among vegetable (products) likewise the barley seed 9. Among all\nthings to. be eaten or swallowed food is the highest; and of\n\np. 354\n\nall liquid substances which are to be drunk, water is the best. And among all\nimmovable entities, without distinction, the Plaksha, the ever holy field of\nBrahman 1, is stated to be the first. I, too, (am the first) among all the\npatriarchs 2, there is no doubt of that. And the unthinkable, self-existent\nVish _n_ u is stated to be my own self. Of all mountains, the great Meru is\nstated to be the first-born. And among all quarters and sub-quarters,\nlikewise, the eastern quarter 3 is the first. Likewise the Ga _n_ ga going in\nthree paths is stated to be the first-born among rivers. And likewise of all\nwells and reservoirs of water, the ocean is the first-born. And of all gods,\nDanavas, Bhutas, Pi _s_ a _k_ as, snakes, and Rakshases, and of men, Kinnaras,\nand Yakshas, \xc3\x8e _s_ vara 4 is the lord. The great Vish _n_ u, who is full of\nthe Brahman, and than whom there is no higher being in these three worlds, is\nthe source of all the universe. Of all orders 5, that of householders (is the\nfirst), there is no doubt of that. The unperceived is the source of the\nworlds; and the same is also the end of everything. Days end with (the sun's)\nsetting 6; the night ends with (the sun's) rising; the end of pleasure is ever\ngrief;\n\np. 355\n\nthe end of grief ever pleasure. All accumulations end in exhaustion; all\nascents end in falls; all associations end in dissociations; and life ends in\ndeath. All action ends in destruction; death is certain for whatever is born\n[1](sbe0857.htm#fn_1771); (everything) movable or immovable in this world is\never transient. Sacrifice, gift, penance, study, observances, and regulations,\nall this ends in destruction [2](sbe0857.htm#fn_1772). There is no end for\nknowledge. Therefore one whose self is tranquil, whose senses are subjugated,\nwho is devoid of (the idea that this or that is) mine, who is devoid of\negoism, is released from all sins by pure knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[352:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1756) See [p. 324](sbe0849.htm#page_324) supra.\n\n[352:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1757) See Gita, [p. 101](sbe0814.htm#page_101).\nUnmoving probably means 'not perturbed by the qualities' (Gita, [p.\n110](sbe0816.htm#page_110)), or perhaps the same thing as 'of steady mind' at\nGita, [p. 101](sbe0814.htm#page_101). The sense is pretty much the same in\nboth places.\n\n[352:3](sbe0856.htm#fr_1758) Which has birth &c., Nilaka _nth_ a, i.e. all the\ncreation, I presume.\n\n[352:4](sbe0856.htm#fr_1759) The names, that is to say, of the various\nelements, and their qualities.\n\n[352:5](sbe0856.htm#fr_1760) This must mean fortnights.\n\n[352:6](sbe0856.htm#fr_1761) This is specified, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, as\nthe six months of the northern solstice are caused by the sun being at this\nNakshatra. As to those six months, cf. Gita, [p. 81](sbe0810.htm#page_81). For\nthe same reason, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra adds, the winter season is mentioned as\nthe best.\n\n[352:7](sbe0856.htm#fr_1762) The word adi, literally beginning, is used in the\nwhole of this passage in different senses; it means the source, it means the\nbest, and it means the first in order.\n\n[353:1](sbe0856.htm#fr_1763) This should be compared with the enumeration at\n[p. 345](sbe0854.htm#page_345) supra, and that in the Gita there referred to.\n\n[353:2](sbe0856.htm#fr_1764) Cf. [p. 346](sbe0855.htm#page_346) supra. Nilaka\n_nth_ a takes fire to mean the gastric fire, and bhuta, rendered by us\nelements, to mean the species of beings born from eggs and wombs.\n\n[353:3](sbe0856.htm#fr_1765) The famous verse 'Tat savitur,' &c. See inter\nalia Brihadaranyaka, p. 999; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 9; Manu II, 77 seq., 104-170.\n\n[353:4](sbe0856.htm#fr_1766) See pp. [264](sbe0833.htm#page_264),\n[265](sbe0833.htm#page_265) supra.\n\n[353:5](sbe0856.htm#fr_1767) Here he turns back to the Savitri, 'looking back\nin the manner of the lion,' says Nilaka _nth_ a, and for purposes of upasana.\nHe does not give up the thread of his discourse entirely, but simply\ninterjects this little clause. Nilaka _nth_ a adds, Savitri here includes\nevery mode of worship prescribed for Brahma _n_ as, &c., and even for Mle\n_kkh_ as. Cf. note 3, and Gautama.(Buhler's ed.), p. 74 note.\n\n[353:6](sbe0856.htm#fr_1768) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 109, and _S_ a _n_ kara's\ncommentary. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra compares this text, Tasmadesha etesham pa _s_\nunam sresh _th_ atamogab. Where it occurs I know not.\n\n[353:7](sbe0856.htm#fr_1769) Cf. Santi Parvan (Ra _g_ adharma), chap. II, st.\n11.\n\n[353:8](sbe0856.htm#fr_1770) I. e. Vasuki, Nilaka _nth_ a. More probably it\nrefers to the species.\n\n[353:9](sbe0856.htm#fr_1771) As it is used in various ceremonies.\n\n[354:1](sbe0856.htm#fr_1772) I. e. the Creator; his field means, I presume his\nspecial seat.\n\n[354:2](sbe0856.htm#fr_1773) Beings from whom all creatures were born. See\ninter alia _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 208, st. 5; Manu I, 34.\n\n[354:3](sbe0856.htm#fr_1774) At [p. 347](sbe0855.htm#page_347) the north is\nmentioned. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra has 'urdhva,' or upward here, and yet 'north'\nbefore. Is the north the best as the seat of the higher world mentioned at _S_\nanti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 192, st. 8 seq.?\n\n[354:4](sbe0856.htm#fr_1775) I. e. Rudra, says Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[354:5](sbe0856.htm#fr_1776) Viz. Brahma _k_ arin, householder, forester, and\nSamnyasin. Cf. _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha),ch. 191, st. 10; Manu VI, 89; Gautama,\np. 190.\n\n[354:6](sbe0856.htm#fr_1777) These stanzas also occur in the _S_ anti Parvan,\nchap. 27, st. 31 seq. (Ra _g_ adharma). A part of them appears to be quoted in\nSa _n_ khya-sutra V, 80. And the commentator Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana Bhikshu introduces it\nwith the expression 'iti _s_ ruyate.' But it is not a Vedic text.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXX](sbe0857.htm)\n\n"
