Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: You have spoken fully about the gifts for the diseased. Tell\nnow, O Lord, of the rites for the dying.\n\n2\\. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, and I will explain the rites for\none leaving the body, and by what rites men after death reach a good\ncondition.\n\n3-5. When, by the effects of karma, the embodied leaves his ordinary body,\nthen, near to a holy basil tree one should make a ring with cowdung. 1\n\nNext, having scattered sesamum seeds, he should strew darbha-grass, and then\nhave the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81lagr\xc4\x81ma stone placed on the cleaned platform.\n\nLiberation is certain for the being who dies near the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81lagr\xc4\x81ma stone, which\nremoves all ills and sins,\n\np. 77\n\n6-9 Where is the shade of the holy basil tree, which removes the pain of\nbeing, there is always liberation for the dying, difficult to obtain by gifts.\n\nThe house in which the holy basil tree is enshrined is like a holy bathing\nplace,--the servants of Yama do not come to it.\n\nYama is not able to see him who gives up his life while having a holy basil\nshoot, though he have hundreds of sins.\n\nThe man who dies with a leaf of it in his mouth, upon a seat of sesamum and\ndarbha-grass, goes to the city of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, unfailingly, though he have no son.\n\n10-13. Sesamums, darbha-grasses and holy basil are three holy things, and they\nprevent an ailing man from going to a miserable condition.\n\nBecause the sesamum is produced from My sweat it is holy; hence Asuras,\nD\xc4\x81navas and Daityas run away from sesamum.\n\nThe darbha grasses, my riches, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3hya, are produced from my hairs; hence\nby the mere touch of them men attain heaven.\n\nBrahma is seated at the root of the ku\xc5\x9ba-grass; in the middle of the ku\xc5\x9ba is\nJan\xc4\x81rdana; 1 at the tip of the ku\xc5\x9ba is \xc5\x9aa\xe1\xb9\x85karadeva 2\\--three shining ones are\nseated in the ku\xc5\x9ba grass.\n\n14-15. Hence ku\xc5\x9ba, fire, mantras, holy basil; Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s and cows do not lose\ntheir purity by being used again and again.\n\nDarbha-grass becomes unclean with rice-balls; Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s, by eating the\nofferings for the departed; mantras, cows and holy basil, when basely used;\nand fire, on a cremation-ground.\n\np. 78\n\n16-20. One should lay the dying man on the ground cleaned with cow-dung and\nspread over with darbha-grasses; not support him in the air. 1\n\nBrahm\xc4\x81, Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, Rudra 2 all the shining ones, and Sacrificial Fire stand upon\nthe ring,---therefore should one make a ring.\n\nThe ground must he pure everywhere, with no stain to be seen. If there is a\nstain it should be cleaned away by further plastering.\n\nDemons, goblins, elementals, spooks, and the followers of Yama enter an impure\nplace, and a cot above the ground.\n\nHence without this ring one should not perform oblations to the fire, \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha,\nthe feeding of Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s, the worship of the Holy Ones; nor place the dying man\nupon the ground.\n\n21-22. Next, placing him on the cleaned ground, one should put gold and jewels\nupon his lips, and give him the Water of the Feet of Vishnu in the form of the\n\xc5\x9a\xc4\x81lagr\xc4\x81ma.\n\nHe who drinks even a drop of the water of the water of the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81lagr\xc4\x81ma stone 3\nis absolved from all sins, and goes to the residence Vaiku\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb8\xa5a. 4\n\np. 79\n\n23-30. Then one should give him the water of the Ganges, which is the effacer\nof great sins, and gives fruit of merit equal to bathings and gifts at all the\nsacred waters.\n\nHe who performs a thousand times the Ch\xc4\x81ndr\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a fast which purifies his body,\nand he who drinks the water of the Ganges, are both equal.\n\nJust as, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, a bundle of cotton is destroyed by falling into the fire,\nso, by his drinking the water of the Ganges, is his sin reduced to ashes.\n\nHe who drinks the water of the Ganges, heated by the rays of the sun 1 is\nfreed from all births and goes to the abode of Hari.\n\nBy bathing in other rivers men are purified,--so also by merely touching,\ndrinking or calling upon the Ganges.\n\nIt sanctifies meritless men by hundreds and thousands. Therefore should one\ndrink of the Ganges, whose water helps one over the ocean of transmigration.\n\nHe who calls, "O Ganges, Ganges" while life is flickering in the throat, goes\nwhen dead to the city of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, and is not born again on earth.\n\nAnd the man who, when his life is leaving, contemplates with faith the Ganges,\ngoes to the highest goal.\n\np. 80\n\n31-33. Therefore he should contemplate, salute, keep in mind the Ganges, and\ndrink its water. Then he should listen, however little, to the Bh\xc4\x81gavata, 1\nwhich is a giver of liberation.\n\nHe who in his last moments repeats a verse, or half or quarter of a verse of\nthe Bh\xc4\x81gavata never returns hither from the world of Brahm\xc4\x81.\n\nThe repeating of the Vedas and the Upani\xe1\xb9\xa3ads; the hymning of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u and \xc5\x9aiva--\nthese bring liberation at death to Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s, K\xe1\xb9\xa3attriyas and Vai\xe1\xb9\xa3yas.\n\n34-35. At the time when the breath is leaving the body, he should make a fast,\nO Bird. Dissatisfied with worldly things the twice-born should take up\nrelinquishment. 2\n\nHe who says, 3 while life is still flickering in his throat, "I have\nrelinquished," goes at death to the city of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, and is not born again on\nearth.\n\n36-39. Then, of him who is righteous and has thus performed the rites, O Bird,\nthe life breaths easily pass out through the higher opening. The mouth, eyes,\nnostrils and ears are the seven gateways through which go those of good deeds.\nYogins go through an opening in the head.\n\nWhen the rising and descending life-breaths, which are joined, become\nseparate, then, becoming subtle, the life-breath departs from the inert body.\n\np. 81\n\nWhen the Lord of Breath departs, the body falls like a tree unsupported and\nstricken by time.\n\n40-41. The motionless body, left by the vital breath, becomes detestable and\nunfit to touch; foul smells soon arise in it, and it is disliked by everybody.\n\nHow can men, who perish in a moment, be proud of the body, with its three\nconditions,--worm, dung and ashes?\n\n42-43. Earth is dissipated to earth; likewise water to water; fire is\ndissipated in fire; also air in air.\n\nAnd, similarly, ether to ether: and the Self that is in the bodies is happy,\nall-pervading, eternally free, witness of the world, birthless and deathless.\n\n44-45. The individual, possessing all the senses, surrounded with sense-\nobjects of sound and the rest, clinging to desire and love, environed by the\nsheath of karma,\n\nEndowed with good tendencies, enters a new body created by his own karma, as\ndoes a householder whose house has been burnt.\n\n46-47: Then the messengers of the Shining Ones, resplendent with flashing\nplumes, arrive, bringing a chariot wreathed with countless bells,\n\nAnd they, knowing the true righteousness, wise, always beloved by the\nrighteous, carry him, who has performed the rites, away in their own chariot.\n\np. 82\n\n48\\. That great man, in a resplendent body, with shining garments and\ngarlands, possessed of gold and diamond ornaments, by virtue of gifts attains\nheaven, and is honoured by the Holy Ones.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[76:1](gpu11.htm#fr_84) Cowdung is extensively used in India as a purifier and\nantiseptic.\n\n[77:1](gpu11.htm#fr_85) Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\n[77:2](gpu11.htm#fr_86) \xc5\x9aiva.\n\n[78:1](gpu11.htm#fr_87) When the people of the house are aware that one is\nabout, to die they remove him from the couch to the ground.\n\n[78:2](gpu11.htm#fr_88) Siva.\n\n[78:3](gpu11.htm#fr_89) Water is [poured over](errata.htm#6) the stone, and\nthus consecrated to Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\n[78:4](gpu11.htm#fr_90) The heaven of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\n[79:1](gpu11.htm#fr_91) Here is a mystical suggestion.\n\n[80:1](gpu11.htm#fr_92) The Bh\xc4\x81gvata Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\n[80:2](gpu11.htm#fr_93) Sanny\xc4\x81sa, giving up attachment to worldly life and its\nobjects.\n\n[80:3](gpu11.htm#fr_94) That is, _truly_ says.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter X.
