(The possibility of) injunctions and prohibitions (results) from the\nconnexion (of the Self) with bodies; as in the case of light and so on.\n\nPassages such as 'He is to approach his wife at the proper time,' and 'he is\nnot to approach the wife of his guru,' are examples of permissions (or\ninjunctions) and prohibitions; or again passages such as 'He is to kill the\nanimal devoted to Agnishomau,' and 'He is not to hurt any being.'\nCorresponding examples from ordinary life are: 'A friend is to be served,' and\n'Enemies are to be shunned.' Permissions and prohibitions of this kind are\npossible, because the Self although one only is connected with various bodies.\n--Of what kind then is that connexion?--It consists in the origination in the\nSelf of the erroneous notion that the Self is the aggregate consisting of the\nbody and so on. This erroneous notion is seen to prevail in all living beings,\nand finds its expression in thoughts such as the following: ' _I_ go,' ' _I_\ncome,' ' _I_ am blind,' ' _I_ am not blind,' ' _I_ am confused,'\n\np. 67\n\n[paragraph continues] ' _I_ am not confused.' That erroneous notion cannot be\nremoved by anything but perfect knowledge, and before the latter supervenes,\nit remains spread among all living beings. And thus, although the Self must be\nadmitted to be one only, injunctions and prohibitions are possible owing to\nthe difference effected by its connexion with bodies and other limiting\nadjuncts, the products of Nescience.--It then follows that for him who has\nobtained perfect knowledge, injunctions and prohibitions are purportless.--No,\nwe reply, (they are not purportless for him, but they do not refer to him),\nsince to him who has obtained the highest aim no obligation can apply. For\nobligations are imposed with reference to things to be avoided or desired; how\nthen should he, who sees nothing, either to be wished or avoided, beyond the\nuniversal Self, stand under any obligation? The Self certainly cannot be\nenjoined on the Self.--Should it be said that injunctions and prohibitions\napply to all those who discern that the soul is something different from the\nbody (and therefore also to him who possesses perfect knowledge), we reply\nthat (such an assertion is too wide, since) obligation depends on a man's\nimagining his Self to be (actually) connected with the body. It is true that\nobligation exists for him only who views the soul as something different from\nthe body; but fundamentally all obligation is an erroneous imagination\nexisting in the case of him only who does not see that his Self is no more\nconnected with a body than the ether is with jars and the like. For him, on\nthe other hand, who does not see that connexion no obligation exists, much\nless, therefore, for him who discerns the unity of the Self.--Nor does it\nresult from the absence of obligation, that he who has arrived at perfect\nknowledge can act as he likes; for in all cases it is only the wrong\nimagination (as to the Self's connexion with a body) that impels to action,\nand that imagination is absent in the case of him who has reached perfect\nknowledge.--From all this it follows that injunctions and prohibitions are\nbased on the Self s connexion with the body; 'as in the case of light' The\ncase under discussion is analogous to cases such as the following: Light is\none only, and yet we shun\n\np. 68\n\na fire which has consumed dead bodies, not any other fire. The sun is one\nonly; yet we shun only that part of his light which shines on unholy places,\nnot that part which falls on pure ground. Some things consisting of earth, are\ndesired, e.g. diamonds and beryls; other things likewise consisting of earth\nare shunned, e.g. dead bodies. The urine and dung of cows are considered pure\nand used as such; those of other animals are shunned. And many similar cases.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 49](sbe38050.htm)\n\n"
