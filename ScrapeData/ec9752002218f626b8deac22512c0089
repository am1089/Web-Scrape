The Matsya says that\nAyodhya was the capital of Divakara. The Vayu omits the next twelve names;\nprobably a defect in the copies.\n\n[463:9](vp115.htm#fr_1316) Dhruva\xc5\x9bwa: Mats.\n\n[463:10](vp115.htm#fr_1317) Bhanumat: Bhag.

Varhish: Bhag.\n\n[463:18](vp115.htm#fr_1325) The Bhagavata and Vayu have \xc5\x9aakya. My copy of the\nMatsya has \xc5\x9aadhya, but the Radcliffe MS., more correctly, no doubt, \xc5\x9aakya.\n\n[463:19](vp115.htm#fr_1326) In some copies Krodhodana; but it is also\n\xc5\x9auddhodana, Mats. and Vayu; \xc5\x9auddhoda, Bhag.\n\n[463:20](vp115.htm#fr_1327) Rahula: Vayu. Siddhartha or Pushkala: Mats.\nLangala: Bhag. This and the two preceding names are of considerable\nchronological interest; for \xc5\x9aakya is the name of the author or reviver of\nBuddhism, whose birth appears to have occurred in the seventh, and death in\nthe sixth century before Christ (B. C. 621-543). There can be no doubt of the\nindividual here intended, although he is out of his place, for he was the son,\nnot the father, of \xc5\x9auddhodana, and the father of Rahula; as he is termed in\nthe Amara p. 464 and Haima Koshas, \xc5\x9aaudhodani or \xc5\x9auddhodana suta the son of\n\xc5\x9auddhodana, and Rahulasu the parent of Rahula: so also in the Mahawan\xc5\x9bo,\nSiddhartha or \xc5\x9aakya is the son of \xc5\x9auddhodano, and father of Rahulo. Turnour\'s\ntranslation, p. 9. Whether they are rightly included amongst the princes of\nthe race of Ikshwaku is more questionable; for \xc5\x9auddhodana is usually described\nas a petty prince, whose capital was not Ayodhya, but Kapila or Kapilavastu.\nAt the same time it appears that the provinces of the Doab had passed into the\npossession of princes of the lunar line, and the children of the sun may have\nbeen reduced to the country north of the Ganges, or the modern Gorakhpur, in\nwhich Kapila was situated. The Buddhists do usually consider their teacher\n\xc5\x9aakya to be descended from Ikshwaku. The chronology is less easily adjusted,\nbut it is not altogether incompatible. According to the lists of the text,\n\xc5\x9aakya, as the twenty-second of the line of Ikshwaku, is cotemporary with\nRipunjaya, the twenty-second and last of the kings of Magadha, of the family\nof Jarasandha; but, agreeably to the Buddhist authorities, he was the friend\nof Bimbasara, a king who in the Pauran\xcc\x81ik list appears to be the fifth of the\n\xc5\x9aai\xc5\x9bunaga dynasty, and tenth from Ripunjaya. The same number of princes does\nnot necessarily imply equal duration of dynasty, and Ikshwaku\'s descendants\nmay have outlasted those of Jarasandha; or, as is more likely--for the dynasty\nwas obscure, and is evidently imperfectly preserved--several descents may have\nbeen omitted, the insertion of which would reconcile the Pauran\xcc\x81ik lists with\nthose of the Buddhists, and bring \xc5\x9aakya down to the age of Bimbasara. It is\nevident, from what occurs in other authorities, that the Aikshwakava princes\nare regarded as cotemporaries even of the \xc5\x9aai\xc5\x9bunaga dynasty: see c. 24. n. 17.\n\n[464:21](vp115.htm#fr_1328) Kshulika: Vayu. Kulaka or Kshullaka: Mats.\nOmitted: Bhag. In the Mahavira Charitra, a work written by the celebrated\nHemachandra, in the twelfth century, we have a Prasenajit, king of Magadha,\nresiding at Rajgriha, succeeded by \xc5\x9arenika, and he by Kulika. The Bauddhas\nhave a Prasenajit cotemporary with \xc5\x9aakya, son of Mahapadma, king of Magadha.\nThere is some confusion of persons either in the Pauran\xcc\x81ik genealogies or in\nthe Buddhist and Jain traditions, but they agree in bringing the same names\ntogether about the same period.\n\n[464:22](vp115.htm#fr_1329) Omitted: Bhag.\n\n[464:23](vp115.htm#fr_1330) The Vayu and Bhagavata have the same stanza. We\nhave here twenty-nine or thirty princes of the later solar line, cotemporary\nwith the preceding twenty-six or twenty-seven of the later dynasty of the\nmoon.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXIII](vp116.htm)\n\n'
