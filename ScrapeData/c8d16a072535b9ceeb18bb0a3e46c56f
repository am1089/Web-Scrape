All\nthe rashes and eruptions they share amongst them, and the youngest of the\nseven is the old friend of our childhood, no less a personage than Measles\nherself. It is strange, we feel, this element of fear that seems so often\nassociated in ancient mythology with the idea of femininity. Head of the Fates\nis she who cuts the thread of life, and all the three are womenkind. Ate, the\nsleepless doom that pursues after the shedder of blood, is a woman. The\nHarpies and avenging Erinys are daughters, not sons, of the gods and of Night.\nAnd here in India the power that is seen in the burning of fever and the\nwasting of disease is conceived as the presence within a man of the Mother\nHerself.\n\nThe fact is an added token of the antiquity of the association. When the\nadministration of justice took the form of a curse or a vendetta, pronounced\nby the grey-haired women of the\n\np. 142\n\nvillage; when all power was as yet in the hands of the Mothers, and men were\nat best but their fierce and courageous children; when rulership could not be\nconceived of apart from the feminine--thus early awoke the idea of the\ndivinity that is seen in the terrible and the irrevocable. Among peoples whose\ngeographical compactness and comparative density hastened their political\ndifferentiation, the terror was more apt to take the form of a reflection of\nthe fear of man and his just wrath. Righteous punishment was a thing to be\nlooked for. The avenger of blood was most to be dreaded of all foes. But in\nIndia, that land of vast spaces and extended populations, the ideal of malign\npower remained mysterious, incalculable, and supernatural. From the beginning\nthere was something inexplicable in the exercise of omnipotence. Could any\nsign of divine presence be more convincing, because more incomprehensible,\nthan the spells of fever, or the anger of a rash? Naturally, then, the\npractice of worship developed the opposite power, that of healing.\n\nVery quaint are the descriptions given by the faithful of the Seven Fearsome\nSisters. That Smallpox makes affrighted goes without saying. Her power is open\nand irrepressible, afflicting men at noonday. But each one, even the youngest,\nhas a potency of her own. Being the youngest, indeed, gives to Measles, it is\nsaid, a peculiar\n\np. 143\n\nability to do mischief. Her very age makes her the pet of her father and\nmother. She is therefore much indulged. She lives suppressed: that is to say,\nshe is apt to exercise her powers in secret, and to leave behind her when she\ngoes some terrible memento of her visit, in a permanent blindness, deafness,\nor lameness. It is evident here that a good deal of fine medical observation\nhas been put into the curious old myth of the seven sisters.\n\nIt would be strange, however, if so careful an index of diagnosis were\nentirely dissociated from all consideration of methods of treatment. As we\nmight have expected, the priests of Sitola come from a peculiar caste, being\nknown as Dom Brahmins, and are, in fact, doctors of a very ancient order. The\noldest worships are connected with libations, the pouring-out of water before\nGod; but in the worship of Sitola the idea of a sanative cleanliness is very\nprominently brought forward. One will sometimes, in the by-ways of some busy\ncity, see women after nightfall pouring out water in the road before a temple\nand sweeping the place with a broom. They are praying to Sitola, the guide\nwill tell us. For those who know have laid down the law that this goddess\ndemands salutation with water and a broom. Indeed she clasps these in her own\narms as represented in her images; and she comes to us, they\n\np. 144\n\nsay, riding on the washerman\'s donkey, an unclean beast. In this last point,\nthough undeniably forcible, public opinion is probably wrong. Sitola is\nrepresented, it is true, as riding on an ass, but in all likelihood this is\nbecause, in that remote past out of which she rose, the ass was the fleet\ncourser, the splendid and romantic steed, hero of all the poetry that now\ncentres in the horse. He may, in an age of degeneration, be relegated to the\nuse of the laundryman\'s caste, daily parading the town with his load of soiled\nlinen for the wash. But he is most emphatically one of those who have seen\nbetter days. Once upon a time he held a ruling position amongst animals, and\nin the Semitic races his appearance in a procession would seem to have\nindicated semi-royal state as late as the opening of the Christian era. Wild\nin the deserts of Arabia, he appears in the liturgy of ancient Egypt as the\nSun-god, and scholars hold that traces of this identification may still be\nfound in the _Rig-Veda_ itself. Even now there is a breed in Persia which is\nfamous and honoured, transcending even the horse in swiftness, and making it\nseem in no wise ludicrous that a goddess should be seated on an ass.\n\nMany students will feel that the assignment of one whole divinity to the\nprovince of a single disease argues a state of society in which there was a\nvery elaborate division of labour. Nor can\n\np. 145\n\nwe help connecting this advance in social organisation with that sudden\naccession of medical science of which the worship of Sitola constitutes a\nremnant. The whole idea is a rare mixture of piety and wisdom. When the\npatient first succumbs to the malady, there is many a village-wife whose\ndiagnosis is as valuable as the physician\'s or the priest\'s. The one anxiety\nis that the eruption should have free way. Should it remain suppressed, the\ncase is regarded as grave. But if this is not so, and matters appear\npromising, the next step is to feed with a sufficient quantity of milk. The\namount of this food that can be digested by a smallpox patient of robust\nconstitution is said to be quite incredible. If the case is bad, however,\nthere is nothing to be done but call for the special attendance of a priest of\nSitola. In this case the sick man will be laid on the floor on cool banana\nleaves. He is also given medicine brought by the priest. A twig of _neem_ is\nsupplied to him, and except with it he is not allowed to touch his own skin.\nTo tickle it with the sacred twig is an invocation of blessing. At the same\ntime devotions are going on. At first, when the fell visitant was announced,\nthe women of the household repaired in the evening to temple or tree, to offer\ntheir worship. Part of this consisted in placing flowers on top of an inverted\npot, at the feet of the goddess, If the flowers fall, she is\n\np. 146\n\npleased, and grants the prayer of her suppliant. But if they remain where they\nwere placed, she is obdurate, and the end can hardly be bright. I have been\ntold of one case in which the women had placed their flowers and sat in the\nattitude of prayer to see what was to be their fate. The blossoms did not\nfall, and in agony of mind the whole party bent still lower in prayer,\nimploring with clasped hands that the Devi might take pity and grant a life\nmuch loved. At this second prayer, as they watched and waited, the flowers\nfluttered down, slowly, slowly, and each one felt that an invisible hand had\ntaken them, and the prayer would be fulfilled.\n\nOnly half the necessary offering is thus made, however. The idea, in Bengal at\nleast, is that the Mother has been asked to visit the abode of her children\nand bless them with a healing touch. This is the element in the myth to which\nprominence is given, though it is not quite clear that there is not mixed with\nit an older notion that it is the presence of the goddess that has brought\ndisaster, and that she is being begged to withdraw. Outside Bengal this last\nseems to be frankly the thought. But here we are mainly in the attitude of\nentreating the Mother to enter the house and bear away its misfortune. The\nmore archaic fear may be traced in the fact that, while the illness remains,\nnone in the house will venture to call it\n\np. 147\n\nby any name but "the mercy." And the visitors who generally throng to see an\ninvalid remain here, it is true, on the threshold; but still they come, saying\nthey are adoring the divine Mother, present in the sick. So the conception of\nthe healing divinity of sweetness has not yet wholly emancipated itself from\nan older and less noble worship of fear; but it is on the way to do so, for\nwhen the recovery has taken place it is always unhesitatingly attributed to a\nvisit of benediction, and many are the household tales of special experiences\nillustrating this. From the moment of the announcement, then, when the worship\nis offered, the house and everyone in it has to be kept in a state of such\nexceptional purity as is meet for those who expect a divine advent. No meat or\nfish may be cooked within the walls. Only after bathing, and wearing the\ncleanest of garments, may the sick be attended. Fresh flowers and incense are\nto be offered daily. Water and the broom must do even more than their ordinary\nwork in constant cleansing. And finally, when the last remnant of his illness\nis well past, the patient marks his own recovery by a delightful bath, for\nwhich he has been prepared by massage, being rubbed with sandal-paste and\nturmeric, ancient luxuries of the toilet, full of coolness and fragrance.\n\nThe sons of Askr, or the ash, carried into Europe,\n\np. 148\n\nit is said, the use of bronze, the domesticated horse, and also the knowledge\nof massage and of healing drugs and oils. We have seen that the horse must\nhave been subjugated by man and have reached the world\'s great trade-routes at\nBabylon and Nineveh only after the ass had been long familiar. We know also\nthat it must have come from Central Asia, and the probability is that it had\nbeen tamed long enough before the memorising of the present _Rig-Veda_ for its\npredecessor to be even then, amongst the Aryans, only a dim and half-conscious\ntradition. That Sitola and her sisters should number seven in all shows that\nthey were the creation of some race in whom astronomic studies and planetary\nlore had already made the number seven peculiarly sacred and impressive, as it\nwas among the singers of the Vedas. They appear also, on comparing their\ncharacters with those of the corresponding fear-creating goddesses of Europe,\nto belong to a civilisation in which political and military ideas were slower\nof growth and personal culture a larger factor. Bronze is held by some\nscholars to have been the result of the exchange of copper at Tamralipti or\nTamluk, with the tin of Malacca, in the ages of the Asiatic merchant-\ncivilisation, which preceded the rise of nationalities. In Asia, as also among\nthe nomads of North America, there seems to have been a short Copper Age\npreceding the Bronze, Copper\n\np. 149\n\nrazors and copper axes have been found in India, and copper knives on the site\nof ancient Troy. After this came bronze, and with bronze, as far as Europe was\nconcerned, the knowledge of medicine and the use of the horse. Older, far\nolder, than any of these, was that worship of the rude stone beneath the\n_neem_ tree, as the throne of the Mother, and those seasonal dances that may\nhave given rise to the tradition of the birth of Askr, the first man, from the\nash. Holy indeed is the ground beneath the olive and the _neem_. Sacred homes\nof the Oil-Mother, from them and their long past has come every notion of\npriestly anointing that a younger world has seen. The chrism of baptism, the\noil of coronation, and the last sad rite of unction and benediction to the\nforth-going soul--here, in the cool breeze that blows through our Indian tree\nof healing, may have been the birth of all these, and of how much more\nthroughout the ages of aid and fellowship between man and man.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Kashmir Shawl](seh25.htm)\n\n'
