Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! Hearing thus the supreme nature of Mula\nPrakriti from Dharmaraja Yama, the two eyes of Savitri were filled with tears\nof joy and her whole body was filled with a thrill of rapture, joy and\necstacy. She again addressed Yama :-- \xc2\x93O Dharmaraja! To sing the glories of\nMula Prakriti is the only means of saving all. This takes away the old age and\ndeath of both the speaker and the hearer.\n\n\n\n3-12. This is the Supreme Place of the Danavas, the Siddhas, the ascetics.\nThis is the Yoga of the Yogins and this is studying the Vedas of the Vaidiks.\nNothing can compare even to one sixteenth of the sixteenth parts of the (full)\nmerits of those who are in S\xc2\x92akti\xc2\x92s Service; call it Mukti, immortality, or\nattaining endless Siddhis, nothing can come to it. O Thou, the foremost of the\nKnowers of the Vedas! I have heard by and by everything from Thee. Now\ndescribe to me how to worship Mula Prakriti and what are the ends of karmas,\nauspicious and inauspicious.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the chaste Savitri bowed down her\nhead and began to praise Yama in stotras according to the Vedas. She said :--\n\xc2\x93O Dharmarajan! The Sun practised of yore very hard austerities at Pu _s_ kara\nand worshipped Dharma. On this, Dharma Himself became born of Surya as his\nson. And Thou art that son of Surya, the incarnation of Dharma. So I bow down\nto Thee. Thou art the Witness of all the Jivas; Thou seest them equally; hence\nThy name is Samana. I bow down to Thee. Sometimes Thou by Thy own will takest\naway the lives of beings. Hence Thy name is Kritanta. Obeisance to Thee! Thou\nholdest the rod to distribute justice and pronounce sentence on them and to\ndestroy the sins of the Jivas; hence Thy name is Da _nd_ adhara; so I bow down\nto Thee. (Note :-- Any Jiva, in course of his travelling towards Mukti, can\nexpect to pass through the stage Yamaship; and if he pleases, he can become a\nYama.) At all times Thou destroyest the universe. None can resist Thee. Hence\nThou art named Kala; so obeisance to Thee! Thou art an ascetic, devoted to\nBrahma, self-controlled, and the distributor of the fruits of Karmas to the\nJivas; Thou restrainest Thy senses. Hence Thou art called Yama. Therefore I\nbow down to Thee.\n\n\n\np. 926\n\n\n\n13-17. Thou art delighted with Thy Own Self; Thou art omniscient; Thou art the\nTormentor of the sinners and the Friend of the Virtuous. Hence Thy name is Pu\n_n_ ya Mitra; so I bow down to Thee. Thou art born as a part of Brahma; the\nfire of Brahma is shining through Thy body. Thou dost meditate on Para Brahma,\nThou art the Lord. Obeisance to Thee!\xc2\x94 O Muni! Thus praising Yama, She bowed\ndown at the feet of Him. Yama gave her the mantra of Mula Prakriti. How to\nworship Her and He began to recite the fruition of good Karmas. O Narada! He\nwho recites these eight hymns to Yama early in the morning, getting up from\nhis bed, is freed of the fear of death. Rather he becomes freed of all his\nsins. So much so, that even if he be a veritable awful sinner and if he\nrecites daily with devotion this Yama _st_ akam, Yama purifies him thoroughly.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-first Chapter of the Ninth Book on the Yama\xc2\x92s giving\nS\xc2\x92akti Mantra to Savitri in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 32](bk09ch32.htm)\n\n"
