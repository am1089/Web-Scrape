That (viz. breath) (is merged) in the ruler (i.e. the individual soul), on\naccount of the (statements as to the pra _n_ as) coming to it and so on.\n\nWe have ascertained that a thing which has not originated from another is not\nitself merged in the latter, but only through its functions. A doubt now\narises whether, according to the word of scripture, the function of breath is\nmerged in heat, or in the individual soul which is the ruler of the body and\nsenses.--According to the purvapakshin we must conclude that the breath is\nmerged in heat only, since the scriptural statement allows no room for doubt\nand we are not entitled to assume something not declared by scripture. The\nbreath under discussion persists 'in the ruler,' i.e. the intelligent Self\n(the individual soul) which possesses nescience, work, and former knowledge as\nlimiting adjuncts; i.e. the function of breath has that soul for its\nsubstratum.--Why so?--'On account of (the pra _n_ as) going towards him,' &c.\n--Another scriptural passage declares that all pra _n_ as without any\ndifference go to the soul, 'All the pra _n_ as go to the Self at the time of\ndeath when a man is thus going to expire' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 38). Another\npassage again specially declares that the pra _n_ a with its five functions\nfollows the individual soul, 'After him thus departing the pra _n_ a departs,\n'and that the other pra _n_ as follow that pra _n_ a, 'And after the pra _n_ a\nthus departing all the other pra _n_ as depart' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 2). And\nthe text, 'He is furnished with intelligence' (ibid.), by declaring the\nindividual soul to\n\np. 368\n\nbe of intimately intelligent nature, suggests that in it, viz. the soul, the\npra _n_ a--into which the different organs of knowledge have been merged--has\ntaken its abode.--But scripture also says, 'The pra _n_ a (is merged) in\nheat;' why then make the addition implied in the doctrine--that breath is\nmerged in the individual soul?--We must make that addition, we reply, because\nin the process of departure &c. the soul is the chief agent, and because we\nmust pay regard to specifications contained in other scriptural passages also.\n--How then do you explain the statement, 'Breath is merged in heat?'--To this\nquestion the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 5](sbe38285.htm)\n\n"
