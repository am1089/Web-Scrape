Vyasa said :-- O King! S\xc2\x92umbha, the Lord of the Daityas, hearing the words\nof the soldiers, began to say, then, with eyes rolling with anger.\n\n\n\n2-15. S\xc2\x92umbha said :-- \xc2\x93O Fools! What are you saying all this? How can I do\nthis unspeakably mean act and then hope to live? How shall I be able to roam\nin this world when I have become the cause the slaying of my brothers and\nministers? Time is the more powerful cause of all that takes place, good or\nbad; so when this formless Time is the Supreme Ruler, what use is there in my\nbrooding over the result? Let whatever come that is inevitable, let whatever\nbe done that is destined to take place; death or life, I do not think of\neither. The more so when Time is never able, even when worshipped, to thwart\noff death or life when their proper moment arrives. See! The God of rain gives\nus rain in the rainy season; but, it is seen that sometimes it does not rain\nin the month of S\xc2\x92ravan (the rainy season); whereas it rains sometimes in the\nmonth Agrahayana, Pau _s_ a, Magha, or Phalguna (not the rainy season).\nTherefore it is evident that Time is not the chief factor. Fate is stronger\nthan Time; Time is merely the instrumental cause. It is this Fate that has\ncreated all this universe; it cannot be rendered otherwise. I consider Fate\nSupreme; Fie on this one\xc2\x92s own exertion! For, Lo! Nis\xc2\x92umbha, who had before\nconquered all the Devas, is slain today by an ordinary woman! Alas!\n\n\n\np. 462\n\n\n\nWhen Raktabija, too, had been slain, how can I desire to hold on to my life,\nforegoing all my name and fame! Even Brahma, who has created all this\nuniverse, will not sooner come to an end than his longevity expires. Four\nthousand Yugas constitute one day of Brahma; and in that one day fourteen\nIndras perished; so twice the life of Brahma constitute the life of Vi _sn_ u;\nsimilarly twice the life period of Vi _sn_ u constitute the life period of\nMahes\xc2\x92a; and when their longevities expire, they come to an end. This visible\nearth, mountains, sun and moon all will perish; so it has been specially\nordained by the Destiny; therefore, O Fools! I do not care a bit for the\ndeath. When a being is born, he must die; and when anyone dies, he will be\nborn again, there is no doubt in this. So one ought to preserve one\xc2\x92s name and\nfame which is more permanent in this transitory body. Prepare my chariot; I\nwill go today to the battlefield; let victory or defeat come what it may, as\nFate has ordained. I will soon go to fight.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n16-33. Thus saying, S\xc2\x92umbha mounted on the chariot quickly and went where the\nDevi Ambika was staying. Then the four-fold army, cavalry, infantry, chariots,\nhorses and elephants and innumerable soldiers, followed him with weapons in\ntheir hands. Going there to the Himalaya mountain, he saw the Divine Mother\nsitting on Her Lion. She appeared so very lovely as to enchant the three\nworlds. Her body was decorated with various ornaments, all the auspicious gems\nwere manifest; the Devas, Gandarbhas, Yak _s_ as and Kinnaras in the heavens\nwere all worshipping Her with hymns and Parijata flowers; and the Devi was\nmaking beautiful sounds with bells and conches, indicative of Her victory.\nSeeing Her S\xc2\x92umbha was very much enchanted with passionate love and struck\nwith, the five arrows of cupid, thought thus :-- How wonderful is Her lovely\ncountenance! See! How wonderful and amazing is Her skilfulness! Delicacy and\ncapability to endure the hardships of war, though quite contrary to each\nother, are both in Her. What a wonder is this! Her bodies are extremely\ndelicate and limbs are lean and thin; besides She is lately blooming into\nwomanhood; still She does not feel any passion; this is undoubtedly very\nwonderful! She is exquisitely beautiful that can be desired of in one\xc2\x92s mind;\nand though She is endowed with all the auspicious signs, yet She has no\ninclinations for all the pleasures and allurements of the world and is now\nslaying the powerful Asuras; this is wonderful indeed! Now what steps are to\nbe taken so that this Lady comes under my control? All the Mantrams also are\nnot with me now to bring over this Swan-eyed Lady unto me. This proud lovely\nLady is the incarnate of all Mantrams; how will She come under my control?\nThis heroic Lady cannot be controlled by conciliatory words, allurements,\ndissensions; it is not advisable, too, to fly away from the battlefield and to\n\n\n\np. 463\n\n\n\ngo to Patala. What am I to do? Where shall I go in this critical moment? And\nif I die at the hands of this Lady, that death is not a glorious one; it will\ntake away my fame. The death in a battlefield is conducive to one\xc2\x92s well\nbeing, so the sages say, when both the parties are equally strong. The Devas\nhave created this Lady stronger than even hundred strong men; She is a woman\nmerely in name. This Lady is very powerful and has come here to destroy the\nDanavas; there is no doubt in this. What effect will conciliatory words now\nproduce on Her; She has come to slay us; Will She be appeased with good words?\nNeither will allurements of precious things be of any avail, for She is decked\nwith various arms and weapons; nor will it be of any use to sow dissensions\nbetween the Devas and Her. Further all the Devas are under Her control.\nTherefore it is far better to die than to fly; victory or death would come\nunto me today as Fate has ordained.\n\n\n\n34-46. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus thinking in his mind, S\xc2\x92umbha became ready\nto shew his strength; and firmly resolved to fight, he said to the Devi before\nhim :-- Devi! Fight. But, O One of delicate limbs! Thy so much toil is in\nvain. Thou hast no sense at all; for Thou art doing contrary to the doings of\nwoman-kind. The pair of eyes of women are their arrows; the eyebrows are their\nbows; their gestures and postures are their weapons and their hits are those\npersons who are skilled in amorous love sentiments. The dyes used in painting\nthe bodies are their armours, their mental desires are their chariots, so\nsweet soft words and conversations are their trumpet sounds; women have no\nother things for their war preparations. Therefore, O Beloved! Any other\nweapons are mere mockeries and ridiculous; their modesty is their ornament;\nimpudence can never grace them. An exquisitely beautiful woman, if engaged in\na fight will look harsh; especially when Thou wilt draw Thy bow, how wilt Thou\nbe able to hide Thy breasts? When Thou wilt run with Thy club, where will Thy\ngentle treadings go? O Beautiful! Thy councillors are this Kalika and the\nstupid Chamu _nd_ a. Cha _nd_ ika is Thy adviser; her voice is very hoarse;\nhow can then she be able to nurse Thee? Again this Lion, the terror of all the\nbeings, is Thy carrier. Therefore, O Dear! Leave aside all these and come over\nunto me. O Beautiful One! That Thou art ringing Thy bells and dost not sound.\nThy lute goes quite against Thy beauty and youth. O Sensitive One! If Thou\nlikest to fight, better assume an ugly appearance, let Thy nature be ferocious\nand cruel; let Thy colour be black like a crow; lips elongated, legs long,\nnails ugly, teeth horrible, and let Thy eyes be ugly or yellow like those of a\ncat. O Devi! Assume such an ugly appearance and stand firmly for the fight. O\nDeer-eyed One! Speak first harsh words\n\n\n\np. 464\n\n\n\nunto me; then I will fight with Thee; my hand does not get up to strike Thee\nwith handsome teeth, in the battlefield, Who art like a second Rati.\n\n\n\n47\\. Vyasa said :-- O Best of the descendants of Bharata! When S\xc2\x92umbha said\nthus, the Divine Mother, seeing him passionate, smiled and said :--\n\n\n\n48-50. O Stupid One! Why are you so much distressed with passion? O Fool! If\nyour hand does not come forward to strike weapons at Me, then fight with this\nugly Kalika or Chamu _nd_ a; they are your best compeers in the battlefield;\nthey will fight with you; I will stand as a mere Witness. Thus saying, the\nDevi Bhagavati said to Kalika, in sweet words :-- \xc2\x93O Kalika! Your nature is\nfierce; this S\xc2\x92umbha likes also the fierce; so kill him.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n51-69. Vyasa said :-- O King! That Kalika, the incarnate of Death, thus\nordered, took up Her club immediately and became ready to fight, as if sent\nthere direct by the God of Death. A dreadful fight then ensued between the\ntwo; and the highsouled Munis and the Devas were present there and witnessed\nthe great event. S\xc2\x92umbha first struck at Kalika, raising his club. Kalika,\nthen, struck S\xc2\x92umbha in return with her club violently. Instantly she made a\ndreadful sound, broke down his chariot, glittering like gold, into pieces,\nkilled the horses of the chariot and slew the charioteer. Walking, then, on\nfoot with a very heavy club in his hand, S\xc2\x92umbha struck with great anger on\nthe breast of Kalika and began to laugh. Kalika, in the meanwhile, rendering\nhis stroke useless, soon took up Her axe and cut off his left hand, pasted\nwith sandal and decked with arms and weapons. His left hand thus out off, his\nwhole body was drenched with torrents of blood; yet he came up with club in\nhis hand and struck Kalika with it. Kalika, too, laughed and with Her scimitar\ncut off his right arm holding the club and ornamented with armlet. S\xc2\x92umbha\nbecame angry and came up violently to kick Her when Kalika quickly cut off his\ntwo legs. His arms and legs thus severed from his body, the Demon frightened\nKalika and told Her, \xc2\x93Wait, wait.\xc2\x94 And soon he came up before Her. Seeing the\nDemon coming, Kalika severed his neck from his body like a lotus; blood began\nto gush out in continuous streams. O King! The head of S\xc2\x92umbha, thus severed\nfrom his body, fell on the ground like a mountain. Immediately the life left\nthe body. Seeing the Danava fall down lifeless, Indra and the other hosts of\nDevas began to worship the Devi Bhagavati, Chamu _nd_ a, and Kalika and\nchanted lovely hymns to them. The winds then began to blow pleasantly; all the\nquarters looked very clear and Fire in sacrificial altars, being\ncircumambulated, became very propitious. On the other hand, those Daityas that\nremained alive quitted\n\n\n\np. 465\n\n\n\ntheir arms and weapons, bowed down to the Divine Mother, and fled away one and\nall to the Patala. O King! I have now described in regular order to you how\nthe Devi protected the Devas and destroyed S\xc2\x92umbha and other Asuras. Those\nhuman beings on the surface of the earth that read this anecdote from the\nbeginning to the very end or hear it constantly, get all their desires\nfulfilled; there is no doubt in this. O King! Verily he gets a son who has not\ngot any son; he gets abundance of wealth who is without any wealth; the\ndiseased become cured of their diseases; what more can be said than the fact\nthat he who hears this glorious deed of the Devi in its entirety, gets all\nthat he desires. O King! That man who reads daily this holy anecdote or hears\nit, has never to fear from his enemies; in addition be gets liberation after\nleaving his this body.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-first Chapter of the Fifth Book on the death of S\xc2\x92umbha\nin the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 32](bk05ch32.htm)\n\n'
