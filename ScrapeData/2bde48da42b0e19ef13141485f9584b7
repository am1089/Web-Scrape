I told thee, blameless Lord! there be paths  \nShown to this world; two schools of wisdom. First  \nThe Sankhya\'s, which doth save in way of works  \nPrescribed by reason; next, the Yog, which bids  \nAttain by meditation, spiritually:  \nYet these are one! No man shall \'scape from act  \nBy shunning action; nay, and none shall come  \nBy mere renouncements unto perfectness.  \nNay, and no jot of time, at any time,  \nRests any actionless; his nature\'s law  \nCompels him, even unwilling, into act;  \n[For thought is act in fancy]. He who sits  \nSuppressing all the instruments of flesh,  \nYet in his idle heart thinking on them,  \nPlays the inept and guilty hypocrite:  \nBut he who, with strong body serving mind,  \nGives up his mortal powers to worthy work,  \nNot seeking gain, Arjuna! such an one  \nIs honourable. Do thine allotted task!  \nWork is more excellent than idleness;  \nThe body\'s life proceeds not, lacking work.  \nThere is a task of holiness to do,  \nUnlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not  \nThe faithful soul; such earthly duty do  \nFree from desire, and thou shalt well perform  \nThy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati --  \nIn the beginning, when all men were made,  \nAnd, with mankind, the sacrifice -- "Do this!  \nWork! sacrifice! Increase and multiply  \nWith sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk,  \nYour \'Cow of Plenty,\' giving back her milk  \nOf all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;  \nThe gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye  \nThe gods will grant to Labour, when it pays  \nTithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats  \nFruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven  \nNo gift of toil, that thief steals from his world."\n\nWho eat of food after their sacrifice  \nAre quit of fault, but they that spread a feast  \nAll for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin.  \nBy food the living live; food comes of rain,  \nAnd rain comes by the pious sacrifice,  \nAnd sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil;  \nThus action is of Brahma, who is One,  \nThe Only, All-pervading; at all times  \nPresent in sacrifice. He that abstains  \nTo help the rolling wheels of this great world,  \nGlutting his idle sense, lives a lost life,  \nShameful and vain. Existing for himself,  \nSelf-concentrated, serving self alone,  \nNo part hath he in aught; nothing achieved,  \nNought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope  \nOf help for all the living things of earth  \nDepends from him. Therefore, thy task prescribed  \nWith spirit unattached gladly perform,  \nSince in performance of plain duty man  \nMounts to his highest bliss. By works alone  \nJanak and ancient saints reached blessedness!  \nMoreover, for the upholding of thy kind,  \nAction thou should\'st embrace. What the wise choose  \nThe unwise people take; what best men do  \nThe multitude will follow. Look on me,  \nThou Son of Pritha! in the three wide worlds  \nI am not bound to any toil, no height  \nAwaits to scale, no gift remains to gain,  \nYet I act here! and, if I acted not --  \nEarnest and watchful -- those that look to me  \nFor guidance, sinking back to sloth again  \nBecause I slumbered, would decline from good,  \nAnd I should break earth\'s order and commit  \nHer offspring unto ruin, Bharata!  \nEven as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense,  \nSo let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set  \nTo bring the world deliverance, and its bliss;  \nNot sowing in those simple, busy hearts  \nSeed of despair. Yea! let each play his part  \nIn all he finds to do, with unyoked soul.  \nAll things are everywhere by Nature wrought  \nIn interaction of the quahties.  \nThe fool, cheated by self, thinks, "This I did"  \nAnd "That I wrought;" but -- ah, thou strong-armed Prince! --  \nA better-lessoned mind, knowing the play  \nOf visible things within the world of sense,  \nAnd how the qualities must qualify,  \nStandeth aloof even from his acts. Th\' untaught  \nLive mixed with them, knowing not Nature\'s way,  \nOf highest aims unwitting, slow and dull.  \nThose make thou not to stumble, having the light;  \nBut all thy dues discharging, for My sake,  \nWith meditation centred inwardly,  \nSeeking no profit, satisfied, serene,  \nHeedless of issue -- fight! They who shall keep  \nMy ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts,  \nHave quittance from all issue of their acts;  \nBut those who disregard My ordinance,  \nThinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss,  \nConfused and foolish. \'Sooth, the instructed one  \nDoth of his kind, following what fits him most:  \nAnd lower creatures of their kind; in vain  \nContending \'gainst the law. Needs must it be  \nThe objects of the sense will stir the sense  \nTo like and dislike, yet th\' enlightened man  \nYields not to these, knowing them enemies.  \nFinally, this is better, that one do  \nHis own task as he may, even though he fail,  \nThan take tasks not his own, though they seem good.  \nTo die performing duty is no ill;  \nBut who seeks other roads shall wander still.  \nArjuna. Yet tell me, Teacher! by what force doth man  \nGo to his ill, unwilling; as if one  \nPushed him that evil path?  \nKrishna. Kama it is!  \nPassion it is! born of the Darknesses,  \nWhich pusheth him. Mighty of appetite,  \nSinful, and strong is this! -- man\'s enemy!  \nAs smoke blots the white fire, as clinging rust  \nMars the bright mirror, as the womb surrounds  \nThe babe unborn, so is the world of things  \nFoiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh.  \nThe wise fall, caught in it; the unresting foe  \nIt is of wisdom, wearing countless forms,  \nFair but deceitful, subtle as a flame.  \nSense, mind, and reason -- these, O Kunti\'s Son!  \nAre booty for it; in its play with these  \nIt maddens man, beguiling, blinding him.  \nTherefore, thou noblest child of Bharata!  \nGovern thy heart! Constrain th\' entangled sense!  \nResist the false, soft sinfulness which saps  \nKnowledge and judgment! Yea, the world is strong  \nBut what discerns it stronger, and the mind  \nStrongest; and high o\'er all the ruling Soul.  \nWherefore, perceiving Him who reigns supreme,  \nPut forth full force of Soul in thy own soul!  \nFight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear Hero! slay  \nWhat haunts thee in fond shapes, and would betray!\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER III OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,\n\n_Entitled "Karma-Yog,"  \nOr "The Book of Virtue in Work."_\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4: Of the Religion of Knowledge](bg04.htm)\n\n'
