XXVIII.\n\nWives of Krishn\xcc\x81a. Pradyumna has Aniruddha: nuptials of the latter. Balarama\nbeat at dice, becomes incensed, and slays Rukmin and others.\n\nRUKMIN\xc3\x8d bare to Krishn\xcc\x81a these other sons, Charudeshn\xcc\x81a, Sudeshn\xcc\x81a, Charudeha,\nSushena, Charugupta, Bhadracharu, Charuvinda, Sucharu, and the very mighty\nCharu; also one daughter, Charumati. Krishn\xcc\x81a had seven other beautiful wives,\nKalindi, Mitravrinda, the virtuous Nagnajiti, the queen Jambavati; Rohin\xcc\x81i, of\nbeautiful form; the amiable and excellent daughter of the king of Madra,\nMadri; Satyabhama, the daughter of \xc5\x9aatrujit; and Lakshman\xcc\x81a, of lovely smiles\n1. Besides these, he had sixteen thousand other wives 2.\n\np. 579\n\nThe heroic Pradyumna was chosen for her lord, at her public choice of a\nhusband, by the daughter of Rukmin; and he had by her the powerful and gallant\nprince Aniruddha, who was fierce in fight, an ocean of prowess, and the tamer\nof his foes. Ke\xc5\x9bava demanded in marriage for him the granddaughter of Rukmin;\nand although the latter was inimical to Krishn\xcc\x81a, he betrothed the maiden (who\nwas his son\'s daughter) to the son of his own daughter (her cousin Aniruddha).\nUpon the occasion of the nuptials Rama and other Yadavas attended Krishn\xcc\x81a to\nBhojakat\xcc\x81a, the city of Rukmin. After the wedding had been solemnized, several\nof the kings, headed by him of Kalinga, said to Rukmin, "This wielder of the\nploughshare is ignorant of the dice, which may be converted into his\nmisfortune: why may we not contend with him, and beat him, in play?" The\npotent Rukmin replied to them, and said, "So let it be:" and he engaged\nBalarama at a game of dice in the palace. Balarama soon lost to Rukmin a\nthousand Nishkas 3: he then staked and lost another thousand; and then pledged\nten thousand, which Rukmin, who was well skilled in gambling, also won. At\nthis the king of Kalinga laughed aloud, and the weak and exulting Rukmin\ngrinned, and said, "Baladeva is losing, for he knows nothing of the game;\nalthough, blinded by a vain passion for play, he thinks he understands the\ndice." Halayudha, galled by the broad laughter of the Kalinga prince, and the\ncontemptuous speech of Rukmin, was exceedingly angry, and, overcome with\npassion, increased his stake to ten millions of Nishkas. Rukmin accepted the\nchallenge, and therefore threw the dice. Baladeva won, and cried aloud, "The\nstake is mine." But Rukmin called out as loudly, that he was the winner. "Tell\nno lies, Bala," said he: "the stake is yours; that is true; but I did not\nagree to it: although this be won by you, yet still I am the winner." A deep\nvoice was then heard in the sky, inflaming still more the anger of the high-\nspirited Baladeva, saying, "Bala has rightly won the whole sum, and Rukmin\nspeaks falsely: although he did\n\np. 580\n\nnot accept the pledge in words, he did so by his acts (having cast the dice)."\nBalarama thus excited, his eyes red with rage, started up, and struck Rukmin\nwith the board on which the game was played, and killed him 4. Taking hold of\nthe trembling king of Kalinga, he knocked out the teeth which he had shewn\nwhen he laughed. Laying hold of a golden column, he dragged it from its place,\nand used it as a weapon to kill those princes who had taken part with his\nadversaries. Upon which the whole circle, crying out with terror, took to\nflight, and escaped from the wrath of Baladeva. When Krishn\xcc\x81a heard that\nRukmin had been killed by his brother, he made no remark, being afraid of\nRukmini on the one hand, and of Bala on the other; but taking with him the\nnewly wedded Aniruddha, and the Yadava tribe, he returned to Dwaraka.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[578:1](vp145.htm#fr_1542) The number specified, however, both in this place\nand in c. 32, is nine, instead of eight. The commentator endeavours to explain\nthe difference by identifying Rohin\xcc\x81i with Jambavati; but in the notices of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a\'s posterity, both in this work and in the Bhagavata, she is distinct\nfrom Jambavati. She seems, however, to be an addition to the more usually\nspecified eight, of whose several marriages the Bhagavata gives the best\naccount. In addition to the three first, respecting whom particulars are found\nin all, Kalindi, or the Yamuna, is the daughter of the sun, whom Krishn\xcc\x81a\nmeets on one of his visits to Indraprastha, and who claims him as the reward\nof her penance. His next wife, Mitravinda, is the daughter of his maternal\naunt, Rajadhidevi ([p. 437](vp107.htm#page_437)), and sister of Vinda and\nAnuvinda, kings of Avanti: she chooses him at her Swayambara. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba\ncalls her Saudatta, daughter of \xc5\x9aivi; and she is subsequently termed \xc5\x9aaivya by\nour text. Nagnajiti or Satya, the next wife, was the daughter of Nagnajit,\nking of Kausala, and was the prize of Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s overcoming seven fierce\nbulls, whom no other hero had encountered with success. Bhadra, princess of\nKekaya, also Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s cousin, the daughter of \xc5\x9arutakirtti ([p.\n437](vp107.htm#page_437)), was his next: and his eighth wife was Madri, the\ndaughter of the king of Madra; named, according to the Bhagavata, Lakshan\xcc\x81a;\nand to the Hari V., Saubhima; distinguishing, as does our text, clearly\nLakshman\xcc\x81a from Madri, and like it having no satisfactory equivalent for\nBhadra. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba does not name Rohin\xcc\x81i, but specifies other names, as\nVrihati, &c. In the life of Krishn\xcc\x81a, taken from the Bhagavata through a\nPersian translation, published by Maurice, there is a curious instance of the\nbarbarous distortion of Sanscrit names by the joint labours of the English and\nPersian translators: the wives of Krishn\xcc\x81a are written, Rokemenee (Rukmini),\nSeteebhavani (Satyabhama), Jamoometee (Jambavati), Kalenderee (Kalindi),\nLechmeena (Lakshman\xcc\x81a), Soeta (Satya?), Bhedravatee (Bhadra), Mihrbenda\n(Mitravinda).\n\n[578:2](vp145.htm#fr_1543) These, according to the Mahabharata, p. 579 \xc3\x81di P.,\nwere Apsarasas, or nymphs. In the Dana Dharma they become Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s wives\nthrough a boon given him by Uma.\n\n[579:3](vp145.htm#fr_1544) The Nishka is a weight of gold, but according to\ndifferent authorities of very different amount. The commentator here terms it\na weight of four Suvarn\xcc\x81as, each about 175 grains troy.\n\n[580:4](vp145.htm#fr_1545) The Bhagavata and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, which both tell this\nstory, agree in the death of Rukmin; but in the Mahabharata he appears in the\nwar, on the side of the Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81avas. The occurrence is a not very favourable\npicture of courtly manners; but scenes of violence have never been infrequent\nat the courts of Rajput princes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXIX](vp146.htm)\n\n'
