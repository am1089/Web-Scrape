This is a _S_ raddha offered on the day of the new moon.\n\n3. 3 Another ( _S_ raddha) is the Anvaharya.\n\n4\\. (It is performed) monthly.\n\n5. 5 The Havis is prepared (by one who has set up the sacred _S_ rauta fires) in the Dakshi _n_ agni (i.e. in that of the three fires which is situated towards the south).\n\n6\\. And from the same (fire the fire is taken which)\n\np. 112\n\nis carried forward (in order to be used at the ceremonies).\n\n7\\. In the domestic fire (the Havis is prepared) by one who has not set up the\n( _S_ rauta) fires.\n\n8\\. One pit (only is made);\n\n9. 9 To the south of it the fire has its place.\n\n10. 10 Here the laying down of the fire-brand is omitted,\n\n11. 11 And (the spreading out of) the layer (of grass),\n\n12. 12 And the anointing (of the bunches of Darbha grass), and the anointing (of the Fathers),\n\n13. 13 And the (offering of) perfume,\n\n14. 14 And the ceremony of deprecation.\n\n15. 15 (The ceremony performed with) the vessel of water forms the conclusion (of the Pi _n_ _d_ apit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a).\n\n16. 16 He should, however, put down one garment (for the Fathers in common).\n\n17. 17 On the eighth day after the full moon of Magha a Sthalipaka (is prepared).\n\n18\\. He should sacrifice of that (Sthalipaka).\n\n19\\. 'To the Ash _t_ aka Svaha!'\xc2\x97with (these words) he sacrifices.\n\n20. 20 The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthalipaka rite.\n\n21. 21 Vegetables (are taken instead of meat) as ingredient to the Anvaharya(-rice).\n\n22\\. At animal sacrifices offered to the Fathers let\xc2\x97\n\np. 113\n\nhim sacrifice the omentum with (the verse), 'Carry the omentum, O _G_\natavedas, to the Fathers' (MB. II, 3, 16);\n\n23\\. At (such sacrifices) offered to the gods, with (the verse), ' _G_\natavedas, go to the gods with the omentum' (ibid. 17).\n\n24\\. If no (god to whom the sacrifice should be offered, and no Mantra with\nwhich the oblation should be made) is known, he sacrifices, assigning (his\noffering to the personified rite which he is performing), thus as (for\ninstance), 'To the Ash _t_ aka Svaha!'\n\n25. 25 The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthalipaka rite.\n\n26. 26 If a debt turns up (which he cannot pay), he should sacrifice with the middle leaf of Golakas, with (the verse), 'The debt which' (MB. II, 3, 18).\n\n27\\. Now (follows) the putting into motion of the plough.\n\n28\\. Under an auspicious Nakshatra he should cook a mess of sacrificial food\nand should sacrifice to the following deities, namely, to Indra, to the\nMaruts, to Par _g_ anya, to A _s_ ani, to Bhaga.\n\n29. 29 And he should offer (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) to Sita, \xc3\x82 _s_ a, Ara _d_ a, Anagha.\n\n30\\. The same deities (receive offerings) at the\n\np. 114\n\nfurrow-sacrifice, at the thrashing-floor-sacrifice, at the sowing, at the\nreaping of the crop, and at the putting of the crop into the barn.\n\n31\\. And at mole hills he should sacrifice to the king of moles.\n\n32. 32 To Indra _n_ i a Sthalipaka (is prepared).\n\n33\\. Of that he should make an offering with (the verse), 'The Ekash _t_ aka,\nperforming austerities' (MB. II, 3, 19).\n\n34\\. The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthalipaka ritual. The\nrest according to the Sthalipaka ritual.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[111:1](sbe30036.htm#fr_387) 4, 1. Khadira-G _ri_ hya III, 5, 35. Comp. M.M.,\n'India, what can it teach us?' p. 240. The word Sthalipaka is used here, as is\nobserved in the commentary, in order to exclude the mess of meat (chap. 2, 14)\nfrom the rites of the Pi _n_ _d_ apit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a.\n\n[111:3](sbe30036.htm#fr_388) Anvaharya literally means, what is offered (or\ngiven) after something else, supplementary. In the commentary on Gobhila, p.\n666, a verse is quoted:\n\namavasya _m_ dvitiya _m_ yad anvaharya _m_ tad u _k_ yate,\n\n'The second ( _S_ raddha) which is performed on the day of the new moon, that\nis called anvaharya.' First comes the Pi _n_ _d_ apit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, and\nthen follows the Anvaharya _S_ raddha; the last is identical with the Parva\n_n_ a _S_ raddha, which is described as the chief form of _S_ raddha\nceremonies, for instance in _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya IV, 1. Comp. Manu III,\n122. 123, and Kulluka's note; M.M., 'India, what can it teach us?' p. 200.\n\n[111:5](sbe30036.htm#fr_389) According to the commentary this and the\nfollowing Sutras refer only to the Pi _n_ _d_ apit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, not to\nthe Anvaharya _S_ raddha. Comp. Khadira-G _ri_ hya III, 5, 36-39.\n\n[112:9](sbe30036.htm#fr_390) See chap. 2, 18.\n\n[112:10](sbe30036.htm#fr_391) See chap. 3, 3.\n\n[112:11](sbe30036.htm#fr_392) Chap. 2, 23.\n\n[112:12](sbe30036.htm#fr_393) Chap. 2, 30; 3, 13.\n\n[112:13](sbe30036.htm#fr_394) Chap. 3, 16.\n\n[112:14](sbe30036.htm#fr_395) Chap. 3, 17 seq.\n\n[112:15](sbe30036.htm#fr_396) Chap. 3, 26.\n\n[112:16](sbe30036.htm#fr_397) Comp. chap. 3, 24. 25.\n\n[112:17](sbe30036.htm#fr_398) 17-21. Description of the third Ash _t_ aka\nfestival.\n\n[112:20](sbe30036.htm#fr_399) Comp. above, III, 7, 20 note.\n\n[112:21](sbe30036.htm#fr_400) Comp. IV, I, 12.\n\n[113:25](sbe30036.htm#fr_401) See III, 7, 20 note.\n\n[113:26](sbe30036.htm#fr_402) I am not sure about the translation of the words\ngolakana _m_ madhyamapar _n_ ena. The ordinary meaning of golaka is 'ball,'\nsee, for instance, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya IV, 19, 4. The commentary says,\ngolakana _m_ pala _s_ ana _m_ madhyamapar _n_ ena madhyama _k_ _kh_ adena.\n\n[113:29](sbe30036.htm#fr_403) The name of the third of those rural deities is\nspelt differently; Dr. Knauer gives the readings, Ara _d_ am, Ara _th_ am,\nAragam, Araram, Aram.\n\n[114:32](sbe30036.htm#fr_404) 32-34. Khadira-G _ri_ hya III, 5, 40. I\nunderstand that this sacrifice stands in connection with the rural festivals\nwhich are treated of in the preceding Sutras. In the commentary, from the\nmantra the conclusion is drawn that the ceremony in question belongs to the\nday of the Ekash _t_ aka. But the Ekash _t_ aka is the Ash _t_ aka of the dark\nfortnight of Magha (see S.B.E. XXIX, 102), and the description of the rites\nbelonging to that day has already been given above, Sutras 17-21. It very\nfrequently occurs in the G _ri_ hya ritual that Mantras are used at sacrifices\nstanding in no connection with those for which they have originally been\ncomposed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 5](sbe30037.htm)\n\n"
