Why am I allowing my life\nto become entangled with Bimala\'s? Am I a drifting log to be caught up at any\nand every obstacle?\n\nNot that I have any false shame at Bimala becoming an object of my desire. It\nis only too clear how she wants me, and so I look on her as quite legitimately\nmine. The fruit hangs on the branch by the stem, but that is no reason why the\nclaim of the stem should be eternal. Ripe fruit cannot for ever swear by its\nslackening stem-hold. All its sweetness has been accumulated for me; to\nsurrender itself to my hand is the reason of its existence, its very nature,\nits true morality. So I must pluck it, for it becomes me not to make it\nfutile.\n\nBut what is teasing me is that I am getting entangled. Am I not born to rule?\n--to bestride my proper steed, the crowd, and drive it as I will; the reins in\nmy hand, the destination known only to me, and for it the thorns, the mire, on\nthe road? This steed now awaits me at the door, pawing and champing its bit,\nits neighing filling the skies. But where am I, and what am I about, letting\nday after day of golden opportunity slip by?\n\nI used to think I was like a storm--that the torn flowers with which I strewed\nmy path would not impede my progress. But I am only wandering round and round\na flower like a bee--not a storm. So, as I was saying, the colouring of ideas\nwhich man gives himself is only superficial. The inner man remains as ordinary\nas ever. If someone, who could see right into me, were to write my biography,\nhe would make me out to be no different from that lout of a Panchu, or even\nfrom Nikhil!\n\nLast night I was turning over the pages of my old diary ... I had just\ngraduated, and my brain was bursting with philosophy. Even so early I had\nvowed not to harbour any illusions, whether of my own or others\' imagining,\nbut to build my life on a solid basis of reality. But what has since been its\nactual story? Where is its solidity? It has rather been a network, where,\nthough the thread be continuous, more space is taken up by the holes. Fight as\nI may, these will not own defeat. Just as I was congratulating myself on\nsteadily following the thread, here I am badly caught in a hole! For I have\nbecome susceptible to compunctions.\n\n"I want it; it is here; let me take it"--This is a clear-cut, straightforward\npolicy. Those who can pursue its course with vigour needs must win through in\nthe end. But the gods would not have it that such journey should be easy, so\nthey have deputed the siren Sympathy to distract the wayfarer, to dim his\nvision with her tearful mist.\n\nI can see that poor Bimala is struggling like a snared deer. What a piteous\nalarm there is in her eyes! How she is torn with straining at her bonds! This\nsight, of course, should gladden the heart of a true hunter. And so do I\nrejoice; but, then, I am also touched; and therefore I dally, and standing on\nthe brink I am hesitating to pull the noose fast.\n\nThere have been moments, I know, when I could have bounded up to her, clasped\nher hands and folded her to my breast, unresisting. Had I done so, she would\nnot have said one word. She was aware that some crisis was impending, which in\na moment would change the meaning of the whole world. Standing before that\ncavern of the incalculable but yet expected, her face went pale and her eyes\nglowed with a fearful ecstasy. Within that moment, when it arrives, an\neternity will take shape, which our destiny awaits, holding its breath.\n\nBut I have let this moment slip by. I did not, with uncompromising strength,\npress the almost certain into the absolutely assured. I now see clearly that\nsome hidden elements in my nature have openly ranged themselves as obstacles\nin my path.\n\nThat is exactly how Ravana, whom I look upon as the real hero of the\n_Ramayana_ , met with his doom. He kept Sita in his Asoka garden, awaiting her\npleasure, instead of taking her straight into his harem. This weak spot in his\notherwise grand character made the whole of the abduction episode futile.\nAnother such touch of compunction made him disregard, and be lenient to, his\ntraitorous brother Bibhisan, only to get himself killed for his pains.\n\nThus does the tragic in life come by its own. In the beginning it lies, a\nlittle thing, in some dark under-vault, and ends by overthrowing the whole\nsuperstructure. The real tragedy is, that man does not know himself for what\nhe really is.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI](hw19.htm)\n\n'
