Narada said :-- On hearing these words of her daughter from her nurse,\nthe King addressed the queen Kaikeyi, of lovely eyes, standing close by, thus\n:-- \xc2\x93Have you heard what the nurse has said? Damayanti has mentally chosen the\nmonkey-faced Narada as her husband. What has she thought? Whatever it be, it\nis no doubt, an act of great foolishness. His face is monkey-like; how can I\nbetroth my daughter to him? Where is an ugly beggar Narada? And where is my\ndaughter Damayanti? The marriage between them is quite unjust; never it should\ntake place. O Beautiful One of good hairs! Better call her before you in\nprivate and show her reasons approved of the S\xc2\x92astras and of the aged persons\nand make her desist from such a rash course.\xc2\x94 On hearing her husband\xc2\x92s words,\nthe mother of Damayanti called her in private and said :-- \xc2\x93O Child! Where is\nyour this beautiful face? And where is the monkey-like face of Narada? You are\nsmart and quick; how have you been, then, deluded by such a Moha? O Child! You\nare the daughter of a king! Your body is gentle like a creeper. And Narada\nalways besmears his body with ashes; so his body is very rough. O Spotless\nOne! How will you change your words with him? Why do you shew your attachment\nto an ugly person? What pleasure do you feel thereby? You would be married to\na beautiful prince; never follow this rash course; your father is very sorry\nto hear these from your nurse. O One of soft body! Judge this yourself, what\nintelligent man is there that is not sorry at the soft Malati creeper\nentwining a thorny tree? Even a stupid silly man would never\n\n\n\np. 579\n\n\n\nfeed a camel, that likes thorns, with soft betel-leaves. When your marriage\ntime arrives, say yourself, who will not be sorry to see you going to Narada\nand embracing him by his arms! Nobody likes to speak with an ugly faced one;\nhow will you be able to spend your time with him till your death!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n14-29. Narada said :-- On hearing the mother\xc2\x92s words, the gentle Damayanti,\nwith her mind intently fixed on me, spoke to her mother, very much depressed\nin her spirits. \xc2\x93O Mother! What good face and beautiful form will avail, who\nis not in the path of love and who is quite ignorant of amorous feelings and\nsentiments! And what will the wealth and kingdoms of that unskilled illiterate\nperson avail! The deer, that roam in the forest, getting enchanted by the Nada\n(sound) Rasa, give up their lives even to the singers. So they are fortunate.\nBut fie to the persons who are illiterate and void of feelings of love! O\nMother! Narada Ri _s_ i is well conversant with the science of music with\nseven Svaras. No other man save Maha Deva knows this. Living with an\nilliterate person is courting death at every moment. One devoid of\nqualifications should be always avoided, by all means, though he be wealthy\nand of a beautiful form. Fie on the friendship with kings that are illiterate\nand puffed up with vain arrogance! A well-qualified man, be he even a beggar,\nis far better to be cultivated friendship with. Leaving other circumstances\nout of account, even to change words with such a well qualified man, makes one\nhighly delighted. The man is very rare in this world, though he be weak, if he\nbe well versed in the science of music and if he knows Svara, Grama,\nMurchchana and be skilled in eight sentiments of love. [Note :-- Svara - _S_ a\n_d_ aja, Ri _s_ abha, Ga _n_ dhara, Madhyama, Panchama, Dhaivata and Ni _s_\nada. Grama - the gradual increase and decrease in Svaras. Murchchana - the\nrising of sounds, an intonation; a duly regulated rise and fall of sound\nconducting the air and the harmony through the keys in a pleasing manner;\nchanging the key or passing from one key to another; modulation; melody]. The\nman versed in the knowledge of Svara leads one to the Heaven of Kailas\xc2\x92a as\nthe rivers Ganges and Sarasvati by their own merits lead one to Kailas\xc2\x92a.\nThere is not the least doubt in this. He is a Deva in his human body who knows\nthe Svara measure; and he who does not know the Svara and its seven grades is\na beast though he has a human form - he who finds no delight when he hears the\ntune regulated by Murchchana and the seven Svaras. Do not consider the deer as\nbeasts for they get enchanted when they hear the musical notes. The venomous\nsnakes, though they have no ears, get delighted to hear the enchanting Svara\nNada by their eyes. They even are to be praised;\n\n\n\np. 580\n\n\n\nbut fie on those human beings who have ears but who do not find any delight\nwhen they hear the Nada! The little children feel intense pleasure to hear the\nmusic, but fie, fie on those elders who are void of this musical sentiments!\nDoes not my father know that Narada is ornamented with many qualifications?\nWho is there in the three worlds like him in singing the Sama songs! For this\nvery reason, indeed! I have already selected him as my husband; afterwards,\ndue to a curse, the Muni, the ocean of qualifications, got his face changed\ninto that of a monkey. The Kinnaras, skilled in the science of music, have\ntheir faces horse-like; but are they not dear to all? What business have they\nto get good faces? They enchant the Devas even by their sweet ravishing songs.\nO Mother! Kindly tell my father that I have already chosen Narada as my\nhusband. Therefore let him deliver me to his hands, without making any further\nrequests in this matter.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n30-40. Narada said :-- On hearing the words of her daughter Damayanti, that\nunblameable pure queen knowing her attachment deep towards me, spoke to the\nKing thus :-- \xc2\x93O King! Now celebrate in an auspicious day and on an auspicious\nmoment the auspicious marriage of Damayanti; the daughter has said that she\nhas already selected Narada as her bridegroom and it cannot be other-wise.\xc2\x94\nThus prompted by the queen, the King S\xc2\x92anjaya performed the marriage ceremony\nof her daughter in accordance with due rites and customs and in an exceedingly\nbecoming manner. O Ri _s_ i! Thus I entered into the married life and remained\nthere though my heart constantly burned with the thought of my monkey-face.\nWhenever the princess used to come to me for my service, I used to get\ntormented with the remembrance of my monkey-face; but her face beamed with\ngladness whenever she saw me; never she became sorry nor dejected, even for a\nmoment, to see my face monkey-like. Thus time passed on. One day the Muni\nParvata suddenly came there, after making his sojourn to many places of\npilgrimages. I showed him a great respect and gladly loved him and greeted him\nduly; he got himself seated in an excellent \xc3\x82sana and became very sorry to see\nme. I am his uncle and have entered into a married life; my face has become\nmonkey-like. Therefore I am very much depressed in spirits and worried with\nthe sad thought and has become lean and thin. Seeing this he was overwhelmed\nwith pity. He then said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! The curse that I cast on you before out\nof my anger, I now withdraw. Hear. O Mahar _s_ i! Let your face be by my\nmerits, again as good as it was before; I now feel pity for the daughter of\nthe King.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n41-52. Hearing thus, my heart also became gentle and instantly with a view to\nfree him of my curse, I said :-- \xc2\x93Let your journey to\n\n\n\np. 581\n\n\n\nthe Heavens be re-established. I now make this special favour on you as\nregards my curse on you before.\xc2\x94 O Dvaipayana! At his word, before our sight,\nmy face became exceedingly handsome as it was before. The princess Damayanti\nbecame very glad and instantly she went to the mother and said :-- \xc2\x93O Mother!\nAt the word of Parvata, the great Muni, the curse of your son-in-law has been\nremoved and his face has become handsome as before and the lustre of his body\nhas also increased.\xc2\x94 The queen was very much filled with ecstasy and joy at\nDamayanti\xc2\x92s words and went hurriedly and informed the King. The King S\xc2\x92anjaya\ngladly went at once to see the Muni. The great King became very glad and gave\nlots of wealth, gems and jewels to me and my nephew Parvata as a dowry. O\nDvaipayana! Thus I have described to you my old story how I felt the strong\ninfluence of Maya. O Fortunate One! Owing to the illusory nature of the Gu _n_\nas, like a magic, no embodied being in this world could have been happy\nbefore, or he is happy now or he will be happy hereafter. Lust, anger, greed,\njealousy, attachment, egoism, and vanity, each one of these is very powerful;\nnobody is able to conquer these. O Muni! The three Gu _n_ as Sattva, Rajas and\nTamas are the entire causes of the coming into this bodily existence of every\nbeing. O Dvaipayana! Once I was passing with Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, laughing and\njoking, making merriments through a forest, when suddenly I was transformed\ninto a woman. Next I became the wife of a king enchanted by Maya, I remained\nin his house and gave birth to many children.\n\n\n\n53-56. Vyasa said :-- O Devar _s_ i! A great doubt has now arisen in my mind\nat your word. O Muni! You are very wise; how then did you get womanhood; how\nagain did you regain your manhood? Who was the king at whose house you stayed\nand how did you give birth to children; describe fully and satisfy my\ncuriosity. Describe to me, now, the nature of Maya, extremely wonderful, by\nwhich this entire universe, moving and non-moving, all are enchanted. O Muni!\nThough I have heard your nectar-like words, capable to remove all the doubts,\nembodying the essence of all the S\xc2\x92astras, yet I am not fully satiated.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-seventh Chapter of the Sixth Book on the marriage of\nNarada and his face getting transformed into that of a monkey in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 28](bk06ch28.htm)\n\n'
