Vyasa said :-- The thousand eyed Indra, hearing this, again asked to\nBrihaspati that he would make preparations for war against Mahi _s_ asura.\nWithout effort kingdoms are not attained; no - nor happiness, nor fame, nor\nanything; those who are weak, they extol effortlessness; but the powerful\nnever praise that. Knowledge is the ornament of the ascetics and contentment\nis the ornament of the Brahma _n_ as; but those who desire lordship over\npowers, effort and prowess to destroy one's enemies are their excellent\nornaments. O Muni! I will kill this Mahi _s_ asura by my heroism as I had, of\nold, destroyed Vritra, Namuchi and Balasura. You are the Deva Guru; therefore\nyou and my thunderbolt are my strength. The immortal Hari and Hara also will\nhelp me in this. O Guru! Preserver of my honour and prestige! Now recite the\nmantras calculated to remove all the obstacles towards my victory. I, too, am\nmaking preparations and raising up my own forces to wage up war against that\nDanava Mahi _s_ a.\n\n\n\n7-13. Vyasa said :-- On hearing Indra's words, Brihaspati smiled and said \xc2\x93O\nLord of the Devas! I see you are bent on fight. I will neither stimulate you\nto fight nor shall I make you desist from the purpose. The issue is doubtful.\nThere may be defeat or there may be victory. O Lord of S'achi! You are not to\nblame at all in this matter; what is written in the Book of Fate will come to\npass, be it victory or defeat. I am not aware of the future in this respect. O\nChild! You know already what an amount of suffering I had to endure in times\ngone by when my wife had\n\n\n\np. 367\n\n\n\nbeen stolen. O Destroyer of the enemies! My wife had been stolen by Moon who\nturned out my enemy; living in my stage of an householder I was put to all\nsort of miseries, deprived of all my happiness. O Lord of the Suras! I am\nrenowned in all the worlds as a man of much wisdom and intelligence. Where\nthen was my intelligence, when Moon carried away, perforce, my wife. O Lord of\nthe Suras! To my mind, the success or failure depends entirely on destiny; yet\nintelligent ones should always resort to efforts and be energetic.\n\n\n\n14-17. Vyasa said :-- O King! On hearing the words of Brihaspati, pregnant\nwith truth, Indra went with him to Brahma, took his refuge and saluting him\nsaid :-- O Grand Sire! The Danava is collecting a big army, and wants to\nconquer and take possession of the Heavens. All the other Danavas have\nenrolled themselves in the list of his army; they are eager to fight and they\nare all very powerful and skilled in arts of warfare. I am therefore very\nafraid and have come to you. You know everything; please help me in this\nmatter.\n\n\n\n18-20. Brahma said :-- We all will go today to the Mount Kailas\xc2\x92a and take\nS'ankara with us and go to Vi _sn_ u. There all the Devas, assembled, will\nhold a council and consider the time and place, when it will be settled\nwhether it is proper or not to fight. For one who dares to do any act without\nconsidering one's strength and without any judgment, certainly courts his own\ndownfall.\n\n\n\n21-35. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing this, Indra with the other Lokapalas and\nDevas, headed by Brahma, went to Kailas'a. Then they came to S'ankara and sang\nvedic hymns to him. Mahes'vara became very much pleased and they taking Him\nwent to Vaikun _t_ ha, the abode of Vi _sn_ u. Indra saluted Vi _sn_ u and\nsang hymns to him, and told him about his errand thus :-- \xc2\x93Mahi _s_ a has\nbecome very haughty on account of the favour bestowed on him and therefore we\nare very afraid (and therefore ask your help to relieve us from this danger).\xc2\x94\nVi _sn_ u, then, hearing the cause of fear, told them :-- \xc2\x93We all will fight\nand kill that Demon.\xc2\x94 Vyasa said :--O king! Thus settling the question,\nBrahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Hari and Indra and the other Devas riding on their own\nVahanas (means of conveyance) respectively dispersed. While Brahma on his\nvehicle Swan, Vi _sn_ u on his Garu _d_ a, S'ankara on his Bull, Indra on his\nelephant Airavata, Kartika on his peacock, and Yama, the god of death on his\nVahana, the Buffalo, were on the point of going with the other Deva forces,\nthe army of the Danava Mahi _s_ a met them on their way, all fully equipped\nwith arms and weapons. A dreadful fight then ensued between the Devas and the\nDanavas.\n\n\n\np. 368\n\n\n\nArrows, axes, Prasas, Mu _s_ alas (clubs), Paras'us (pick axes), Gadas\n(clubs), Pattis'as, S'ulas (tridents), chakras (discus) S'akti (weapons),\nTomaras, Mudgaras, Bhindipalas, Langalas, and various other deadly weapons\nappeared on the scenes with which they fought against one another. The\nCommander-in-Chief of Mahi _s_ a, the very powerful Chik _s_ ura, shot five\nsharp arrows at Indra. The ever-ready and light-handed Indra too, with his\narrows cut off all of them and struck at his heart heavily with his\nArdhachandra (half moon) arrow. The Commander-in-Chief, struck by this arrow\nfell senseless on the back of his elephant. Indra, then struck the trunk of\nthe elephant with his Vajra (thunderbolt); the elephant then severely struck\nwith the Vajra fled away into the Danava's forces. The Lord of the Danavas\nseeing this, got very angry and addressed the general Vidala \xc2\x93O Hero! You are\nvery powerful; go then and kill first that haughty Indra; then kill Varu _n_ a\nand other Devas and come back to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n36-57. Vyasa said :-- The very powerful Asura Vi _d_ ala, on receiving the\norder came up at once to Indra, mounted on a very furious elephant. Seeing him\ncoming, Vasava shot at him angrily with very terrible and most powerful arrows\nthat looked like deadly snakes. But the Demon, too, out off those arrows at\nonce with his excellent arrows and quickly shot at Vasava fifty arrows,\nsharpened on stones. Indra cut off all those and, being infuriated, shot again\nsharp deadly serpent-like arrows at him, and cutting off again all his\nenemies' arrows by arrows discharged from his bow, struck the elephant's trunk\nwith his Gada (club). The elephant, being thus struck on his head, cried aloud\nin a distressed tone and being afraid turned back, thus killing the Danava\nforces as he fled away. The general Vi _d_ ala, seeing the elephant fleeing\naway from the battle-field, mounted on a beautiful chariot and instantly\nappeared before the Devas to fight with them. Seeing the Danava coming again\non a chariot, Indra shot at him sharp arrows after arrows like venomous\nsnakes. The powerful Danava, too, infuriated hurled at him terrible arrows;\nthen a sharp conflict ensued between Vasava and the Danava. Finding the Danava\npowerful, Vasava's senses were confounded with anger; he then took his son\nJayanta before him and began to fight. Jayanta stretched his bow tight and\nshot at the breast of the Danava swelled with pride, five sharp arrows with\nhis full strength. Thus shot at by the network of arrows, the Danava fell\nunconscious on the chariot; the charioteer then fled away with his chariot\nfrom the battle-field. Thus on the Danava Vi _d_ ala becoming unconscious and\nbeing taken away from the field, the Dunduvis (drums) of the Devas were\nresounded and great acclamations\n\n\n\np. 369\n\n\n\nof \xc2\x93Victory to the Devas\xc2\x94 were heard. The Devas were very glad and sounded\nhymns before Indra; the Gandarbhas began to sing and the Apsaras began to\ndance. O king! Hearing the loud acclamations of victory to the Devas, Mahi _s_\na became very angry and ordered the Danava Tamra, the destroyer of enemy's\npride, to go to the battle-field. Tamra appeared in the battle, and, coming\nface to face with many Deva warriors, hurled on them showers of arrows. Varu\n_n_ a appeared with his Pas'a weapon and Yama, mounted on his buffalo,\nappeared with his Da _nd_ a (staff). A terrible fight then ensued between the\nDevas and Danavas and the weapons, arrows, axes, Musalas, S'aktis and Paras'us\nglittered in the fields. Yama raising his Da _nd_ a with his hands struck at\nTamra; but the powerful Tamra, though severely struck, was not at all moved\nand remained firm in his place in the field. On the other hand Tamra,\nviolently drawing his bow, hurled a mass of sharp arrows at Indra and the\nother Devas. The Devas got angry and shot at the Danava multitudes of divine\narrows sharpened on stone, and frequently called aloud \xc2\x93Wait, wait.\xc2\x94 The\nDanava Tamra thus shot at by the arrows of the Devas, fell unconscious in the\nbattle-field; the Danava forces got afraid and a cry of universal\nconsternation and distress arose.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifth Chapter of the Fifth Skandha on the defeat of the Danava\nforces of Mahi _s_ a in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk05ch06.htm)\n\n"
