'Next follows the explanation of the Infinite as the Self: Self is below,\nabove, behind, before, right and left--Self is all this.\n\n'He who sees, perceives, and understands this, loves the Self, delights in the\nSelf, revels in the Self, rejoices in the Self--he becomes a Svara _g_ , (an\nautocrat or self-ruler); he is lord and master in all the worlds.\n\n'But those who think differently from this, live in perishable worlds, and\nhave other beings for their rulers.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[123:1](sbe01157.htm#fr_322) Bhuman is sometimes translated by grandeur, the\nsuperlative, the akme. It is the highest point that can be reached, the\ninfinite and the true.\n\n[123:2](sbe01158.htm#fr_323) This phrase reminds one of the last verse in the\nNo sad asid hymn, where, likewise, the expression of the highest certainty is\nfollowed by a misgiving that after all it may be otherwise. The commentator\ntakes yadi va in the sense of, if you ask in the highest sense, then I say no;\nfor the Infinite cannot rest in anything, not even in greatness.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 26](sbe01160.htm)\n\n"
