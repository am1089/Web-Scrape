But the hands and so on also; (since they assist the soul) abiding (in the\nbody). Hence (it is) not so.\n\nThe organs are not seven only, but eleven, since the hands and the rest also\ncontribute towards the experience and fruition of that which abides in the\nbody, i.e. the soul, and have their separate offices, such as seizing, and so\non. Hence it is not so, i.e. it must not be thought that the hands and the\nrest are not organs. Buddhi, ahankara and _k_ itta, on the other hand, are(not\nindependent organs but) mere designations of the manas, according as the\nlatter is engaged in the functions of deciding (adhyavasaya), or misconception\n(abhimana, or thinking ( _k_ inta). The organs therefore are eleven. From this\nit follows that in the passage 'Ten are these pra _n_ as in man, and \xc3\x82tman is\nthe eleventh'(B _ri_. Up. II, 4, ii), the word \xc3\x82tman denotes the manas. The\nnumber _eleven_ is confirmed by scriptural and Sm _ri_ ti passages, cp. 'the\nten organs and the one' (Bha. Gi. XIII, 5); 'ten are the vaikarika beings, the\nmanas is the eleventh,' and others. Where more organs\n\np. 572\n\nare mentioned, the different functions of the manas are meant; and references\nto smaller numbers are connected with special effects of the organs, such as\naccompanying the soul, and the like.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of\n'the going of the seven.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 6.
