Now (follow) the ceremonies of the days of the new and full moon.\n\nHe fasts.\n\n2 2. In the morning, when the sun shines on the\n\np. 17\n\ntop of the great trees, that is the most auspicious time for all kinds of\nsacrifices, unless there be a special rule.\n\n3 3. With a genial mind, clean, on a pure, protected spot, having cooked a\nfull, thin mess of rice, he offers that cooked oblation to the deities of the\nfestivals of the new and full moon, distributing it in the due way.\n\n4 4. In the oblations of cooked food the acts of taking (the intended\noblation), of putting it down (near the fire), and of sprinkling it (with\nwater) are performed with regard to the deities of the (respective) Mantras.\n\np. 18\n\n5 5. And the rules about the portions to be cut off (from the sacrificial\nfood, are valid).\n\n6 6. But before the sacrifices of the new and full moon one should make\nofferings to the deities of the Anvarambha _n_ iya ceremony.\n\n7 7. The time for the new moon sacrifice is not elapsed until the full moon,\nnor that for the full moon sacrifice until the new moon.\n\n8 8. And some say that the morning oblation may be made at the time of the\nevening oblation, in the case of danger.\n\n9\\. But the time is fixed, as at the Agnihotra an expiation has been\nprescribed for him who has neglected the time.\n\n10\\. At the two daily oblations one should use as sacrificial food either rice\nor barley or grains.\n\n11\\. In case these are not at hand, other (sorts of sacrificial food are) not\nprohibited.\n\n12\\. Some say that if he uses grains, he should wash them.\n\n13\\. With the other (kinds of food) no such preparation takes place.\n\np. 19\n\n14 14-15. In the evening (he makes the oblation) to Agni, in the morning to\nSurya,\n\n15\\. And after both silently to Pra _g_ apati.\n\n16\\. Some (say that) before the first oblation a piece of wood (is to be put\non the fire).\n\n17 17.

Most probably this rule should be divided\ninto two Sutras, so that atha darsapur _n_ amasau would stand as the heading\nof the chapter; comp. below, chap. 18, 1, atha _k_ aturthikarma; chap. 24, 1,\natha _g_ atakarma, &c.\n\n[16:2](sbe29005.htm#fr_22) \'If this is expressly stated, the oblation is to be\nmade in night-time; for instance, at the Vastoshpatiya ceremony it is stated,\n"The tenth oblation of the Sthalipaka, to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t at night"\n(see below, III, 4, 8).\' Naraya _n_ a.\n\n[17:3](sbe29005.htm#fr_23) On vighana, which I have translated thin, see the\nnote in the German edition, pp. 119 seq.\n\nThe deities of the festivals of the new and full moon (i.e. of the rites which\nin the _S_ rauta ritual correspond to that taught here) are, at the full moon,\nAgni and Agnishomau, at the new moon, Agni, Vish _n_ u, and Indragni, who are\npreceded in both cases by Agni and Soma as the deities of the two a _g_\nyabhagas (see below, ch. 9, 7), and followed by Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.

A number of ceremonies common to the Sthalipaka ritual\nand to the ordinary ritual of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations, such as the strewing of Ku\n_s_ a grass round the fire, the ceremonies regarding the Pavitras (strainers),\n&c., have to be supplied here from the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya ritual given below (ch. 7\nseq.); this may be looked upon as an argument in favour of our conjecture\nwhich will be stated in the preface (vol. ii of the G _ri_ hya-sutras), that\nour text, as probably is the case also with the Paraskara-sutra, is based on\nan original, the opening sentences of which are preserved to us in _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh.\nI, 5, 1-5 = Paraskara I, 4, 1-5, so that the first chapters of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana,\nand among them the exposition of the festivals of the full and new moon, would\nhave been prefixed to the original commencement of the text.\n\n[18:5](sbe29005.htm#fr_25) On the avadanadharmas comp.
