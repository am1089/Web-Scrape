Now (follows) the _S_ rava _n_ a ceremony,\n\n2\\. On the full-moon day of the _S_ rava _n_ a month.\n\n3\\. He cooks a mess of sacrificial food, fried grains, and a cake in one dish,\npounds the greater part of the grains, sacrifices the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions,\nand two (other) \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations (with the following verses):\n\n4 4. 'Beat away, O white one, with thy foot, with the fore-foot and with the\nhind-foot, these seven [children] of Varu _n_ a and all (daughters) of the\nking's tribe. Svaha!'\n\n5 5. 'Within the dominion of the white one, the Serpent has seen nobody. To\nthe white one, the son of Vidarva, adoration! Svaha!'\n\n6\\. He makes oblations of the mess of cooked sacrificial food to Vish _n_ u,\nto _S_ rava _n_ a, to the full moon of _S_ rava _n_ a, and to the rainy\nseason,\n\n7\\. (And oblations) of the grains with (the verse), 'Accompanied with grains'\n(Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XX, 29).\n\np. 328\n\n8\\. He sacrifices flour, over which ghee has been poured, to the serpents\n(with the following Mantras):\n\n9\\. 'To the lord of the serpents belonging to Agni, of the yellowish,\nterrestrial ones, svaha!\n\n'To the lord of the white serpents belonging to Vayu, of the aerial ones,\nsvaha!\n\n'To the lord of the overpowering serpents belonging to Surya, of the celestial\nones, svaha!\n\n10\\. The (cake) in one dish he offers entirely (without leaving a remainder\nfor the sacrificer) with (the formula), 'To the firm one, the son of the\nEarth, svaha!'\n\n11 11. After he has eaten (of the sacrificial food), he throws a portion of\nthe flour into a basket, goes out, besmears an elevated spot outside the hall\n(with cowdung), says, while a fire-brand is held (before him), 'Do not step\nbetween (myself and the fire),' and without speaking (anything except the\nMantras), he causes the serpents to wash themselves, (pouring out water for\nthem, with the formulas:)\n\n12\\. 'Lord of the serpents belonging to Agni, of the yellowish, terrestrial\nones, wash thyself!\n\n'Lord of the white serpents belonging to Vayu, of the aerial ones, wash\nthyself!\n\n'Lord of the overpowering serpents belonging to Surya, of the celestial ones,\nwash thyself!'\n\n13 13. Each time after the washing has been done, he offers to the serpents a\nBali of flour, picking out\n\np. 329\n\n[paragraph continues] (portions of it) with (the spoon called) Darvi (with the\nformulas):\n\n14\\. 'Lord of the serpents belonging to Agni, of the yellowish, terrestrial\nones, this is thy Bali!\n\n'Lord of the white serpents belonging to Vayu, of the aerial ones, this is thy\nBali!\n\n'Lord of the overpowering serpents belonging to Surya, of the celestial ones,\nthis is thy Bali!'\n\n15 15. After he has made them wash themselves as above, he combs them with\ncombs (with the formulas)\n\n16\\. 'Lord of the serpents belonging to Agni, of the yellowish, terrestrial\nones, comb thyself!\n\n'Lord of the white serpents belonging to Vayu, of the aerial ones, comb\nthyself!\n\n'Lord of the overpowering serpents belonging to Surya, of the celestial ones,\ncomb thyself!'\n\n17\\. (He offers) collyrium, ointment, and garlands with (the same formulas),\nputting at their end, respectively, the words, 'Salve thy eyes!' 'Anoint\nthyself!' 'Put on garlands!'\n\n18\\. The remainder of the flour he pours out on the elevated spot (mentioned\nin Sutra 11), pours water on it out of a water-pot, and worships the\n\np. 330\n\nserpents with the three (verses), 'Adoration be to the serpents' (Va _g_. Sa\n_m_ h. XIII, 6 seqq.).\n\n19\\. At that distance in which he wishes the serpents not to approach (the\nhouse), he should three times walk round the house, sprinkling an\nuninterrupted stream of water round it, with the two (verses), 'Beat away, O\nwhite one, with thy foot' (Sutras 4 and 5).\n\n20\\. He gives away the (spoon called) Darvi (Sutra 13) and the basket (Sutra\n11), having washed and warmed them.\n\n21\\. Near the door (of the house) they clean themselves with the three\n(verses), 'O waters, ye are' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XI, 50 seqq.).\n\n22 22. Having put away that remainder of flour in a hidden place, he should\nfrom that time daily till the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i, after sunset, when he has\nperformed the service to the fire, offer to the serpents a Bali of flour,\npicking out (portions of it) with the Darvi (spoon).\n\n23 23. When he is offering (the Bali), let no one step between (the sacrificer\nand the Bali).\n\n24 24. With the Darvi (spoon) he rinses his mouth. Having washed it, he puts\nit away.\n\n20\\. According to the commentators he gives these things to the man who holds\nthe fire-brand (Sutra 11).\n\np. 331\n\n25 25. They eat the (rice) grains which must not form one coherent mass.\n\n26\\. Then (follows) the feeding of the Brahma _n_ as.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[327:1](sbe29187.htm#fr_839) 14, 1 seqq. Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana IV, 5; \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana II, 1; Gobhila III, 7.\n\n[327:4](sbe29187.htm#fr_840) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana II, 3, 3; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana IV, 18, 1.\nFor Varu _n_ ai _h_ and ra _g_ abandhavai _h_ I read Varu _n_ i _h_ , ra _g_\nabandhavi _h_. Pra _g_ a _h_ is an interpolation.\n\n[327:5](sbe29187.htm#fr_841) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, loc. cit. One is rather tempted\nto correct ahir dada _m_ _s_ a ka _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ana, but Rama _k_ andra's Paddhati\non _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana gives the reading dadar _s_ a, as the Paraskara MSS. do.\n\n[328:11](sbe29187.htm#fr_842) The ceremony with the fire-brand seems to stand\nin connection with the rule given by \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, II, 1, 13, that before\nthe sacrificer has given himself in charge' to the serpents, nobody is allowed\nto step between him and the Bali destined for the serpents. Comp. also below,\nSutra 23.\n\n[328:13](sbe29187.htm#fr_843) I have translated upaghatam by 'picking out.' On\nthe full p. 329 technical meaning of the term, which implies the omission of\nthe upastara _n_ a and abhighara _n_ a, see Bloomfield's note on G _ri_ hya-sa\n_m_ graha I, 111 (Zeitschrift der deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft,\nXXXV, 568).\n\n[329:15](sbe29187.htm#fr_844) The words as above refer to Sutra 11.\nPralikhati, which I have translated 'he combs them,' is the same act for which\nSa\xe1\xb9\x85khayana (IV, 15, 7) says, pha _n_ ena _k_ esh _t_ ayati. I think Professor\nStenzler is wrong in translating: Er scharrt (das Mehl) mit Kammen zusammen.\n_G_ ayarama says: pralekhana _m_ _k_ a krame _n_ a pratimantram balika _n_ _d_\nuyana _m_ ka\xe1\xb9\x85katai _h_. tani _k_ a vaika\xe1\xb9\x85katiyani prade _s_ amatra _n_ y\nekatodantani kash _th_ ani bhavanti.\n\n[330:22](sbe29187.htm#fr_845) The \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i is the full-moon day of Marga\n_s_ irsha, on which the Pratyavaroha _n_ a ceremony is celebrated. See below,\nIII, 2; Weber, die vedischen Nachrichten von den Naxatra, II, 332. The\nexpression darvyopaghata _m_ is the same that has occurred above in Sutra 13.\n\n[330:23](sbe29187.htm#fr_846) Comp. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya II, 1, 13, and\nsee above, Sutra 11.\n\n[330:24](sbe29187.htm#fr_847) Prakshalya seems to me to refer to the Darvi;\nsee Sutra 20.\n\n[331:25](sbe29187.htm#fr_848) Asa _m_ syuta _h_.
