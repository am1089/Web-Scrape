And on account of the statement as to abode, and so on.\n\np. 273\n\nAbiding within the eye, ruling the eye, and so on are predicated by scripture\nof the highest Self only, viz. in B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 18, 'He who dwells\nwithin the eye, who rules the eye within.' We therefore recognise that highest\nSelf in the text, 'That Person which is seen within the eye.' The argument\nfounded on reference to 'something well known' thus suits the highest Self\nvery well; and also the clause which denotes immediate perception ('is seen')\nappears quite suitable, since the highest Self is directly intuited by persons\npractising mystic concentration of mind (Yoga).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15.
