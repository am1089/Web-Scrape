Drive ye away death! May we walk with him safely; may he walk here in bliss; (may he) walk in bliss until (he returns) to his house\'\xc2\x97this (verse the teacher repeats) while (the boy) walks round the fire so as to keep his right side turned towards it.\n\n2. 2 (The teacher) then causes him to say, \'I have come hither to be a student. Initiate me! I will be a student, impelled by the god Savitri.\'\n\n3\\. (The teacher then) asks him:\n\n4\\. \'What is thy name?\'\n\n5. 5 He says, \'N.N!\'\xc2\x97what his name is.\n\n6. 6 (The teacher says), \'Happily, god Savit _ri_ , may I attain the goal with this N.N.\'\xc2\x97here he pronounces (the student\'s) two names.\n\n7. 7 With (the verse), \'For bliss may the goddesses afford us their protection; may the waters afford drink to us. With bliss and happiness may they overflow us\'\xc2\x97both wipe themselves off.\n\np. 151\n\n8. 8 Then (the teacher) touches with his right hand (the boy\'s) right shoulder, and with his left (hand) his left (shoulder), and draws (the boy\'s) right arm towards himself with the Vyah _ri_ tis, the Savitri verse, and with (the formula), \'By the impulse of the god Savit _ri_ , with the arms of the two A _s_ vins, with Pushan\'s hands I initiate thee, N.N.!\'\n\n9. 9 He then seizes with his right hand (the boy\'s) right hand together with the thumb, with (the words), \'Agni has seized thy hand; Soma has seized thy hand; Savit _ri_ has seized thy hand; Sarasvati has seized thy hand; Pushan has seized thy hand; B _ri_ haspati has seized thy hand; Mitra has seized thy hand; Varu _n_ a has seized thy hand; Tvash _t_ _ri_ has seized thy hand; Dhat _ri_ has seized thy hand; Vish _n_ u has seized thy hand; Pra _g_ apati has seized thy hand.\'\n\n10. 10 \'May Savit _ri_ protect thee. Mitra art thou by rights; Agni is thy teacher.\n\n\'By the impulse of the god Savit _ri_ become B _ri_ haspati\'s pupil. Eat\nwater. Put on fuel. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time\'\xc2\x97thus (the\nteacher) instructs him.\n\n11. 11 Then (the teacher) gradually moves his right\n\np. 152\n\nhand down over (the boy\'s) right shoulder and touches the place of his heart\nwith (the formulas), \'Thy heart shall dwell in my heart; my mind thou shalt\nfollow with thy mind; in my word thou shalt rejoice with all thy heart; may B\n_ri_ haspati join thee to me!\n\n\'To me alone thou shalt adhere. In me thy thoughts shall dwell. Upon me thy\nveneration shall be bent. When I speak, thou shalt be silent.\'\n\n12\\. With (the words), \'Thou art the knot of all breath; do not loosen\nthyself\'\xc2\x97(he touches) the place of his navel.\n\n13. 13 After (the teacher) has recited over him (the formula),\n\n\'Bhu _h_! Bhuva _h_! Suva _h_! By offspring may I become rich in offspring! By\nvaliant sons, rich in valiant sons! By splendour, rich in splendour! By\nwealth, rich in wealth! By wisdom, rich in wisdom! By pupils, rich in holy\nlustre!\'\n\nAnd (again the formulas),\n\n\'Bhu _h_! I place thee in the _Ri_ _k_ as, in Agni, on the earth, in voice, in\nthe Brahman, N.N.!\n\n\'Bhuva _h_! I place thee in the Ya _g_ us, in Vayu, in the air, in breath, in\nthe Brahman, N.N.!\n\n\'Suva _h_! I place thee in the Samans, in Surya, in heaven, in the eye, in the\nBrahman, N.N.!\n\n\'May I be beloved (?) and dear to thee, N.N.!\n\np. 153\n\n[paragraph continues] May I be dear to thee, the fire (?), N.N.! Let us dwell\nhere! Let us dwell in breath and life! Dwell in breath and life, N.N.!\'\xc2\x97\n\n14. 14 He then seizes with his right hand (the boy\'s) right hand together with the thumb, with the five sections, \'Agni is long-lived.\'\n\n15\\. \'May (Agni) bestow on thee long life everywhere\' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 3,\n14, 4)\xc2\x97\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[150:1](sbe30048.htm#fr_500) 5, 1. I read, pra su m _ri_ tyu _m_ yvyotana;\ncomp.

Gobhila II, 20, 21 seq.; Paraskara\nII, 2, 6; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 2, 4, &c.\n\n[150:5](sbe30048.htm#fr_502) Mat _ri_ datta, \'As it is said below, "he\npronounces his two names" (Sutra 6), the student should here also pronounce\nhis two names, for instance, "I am Devadatta, Karttika."\'\n\n[150:6](sbe30048.htm#fr_503) \'His common (vyavaharika) name and his Nakshatra\nname.\' Mat _ri_ datta.\n\n[150:7](sbe30048.htm#fr_504) _Ri_ g-veda X, 9, 4.\n\n[151:8](sbe30048.htm#fr_505) The word which I have translated \'draws . . .\ntowards himself\' is the same which is also used in the sense of \'he initiates\nhim\' (upanayate). Possibly we should correct the text: dakshi _n_ a _m_ bahum\nanv abhyatmam upanayate, \'he turns him towards himself from left to right\n(literally, following his right arm).\' Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 3, 2.\xc2\x97Regarding\nthe Mantra, comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 2, 12, &c.\n\n[151:9](sbe30048.htm#fr_506) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 2, 11; 3, 1, &c.\n\n[151:10](sbe30048.htm#fr_507) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 3, 1; 4, 5. We ought to read\napo\xe0\xa4\xbd _s_ ana, instead of apo\xe0\xa4\xbdsana _h_ as the MSS. have.\n\n[151:11](sbe30048.htm#fr_508) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 4, 1, &c.\n\n[152:13](sbe30048.htm#fr_509) The reading of the last Mantra is doubtful. Ish\n_t_ atas should possibly be ish _t_ as, but the genitive analasya, or, as some\nof the MSS. have, ana _l_ asya (read, analasasya?), points rather to a\ngenitive like i _k_ _kh_ atas. If we write i _k_ _kh_ atas and analasasya, the\ntranslation would be: \'May I be dear to thee, who loves me, N.N.! May I be\ndear to thee, who art zealous, N.N.!\' Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 3, 3.\n\n[153:14](sbe30048.htm#fr_510) Comp. above, Sutra 9.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 6](sbe30049.htm)\n\n'
