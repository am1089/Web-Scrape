When Matari _s_ van \xe2\x80\xa6 [1](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:1:1) had produced by\nattrition the Hot _ri_ , the \xe2\x80\xa6 [2](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:1:2) who belongs to\nall gods, whom they have established among the human clans, shining like the\nsun, resplendent that (he might show his beautiful) shape--\n\n2\\. They did not deceive him [1](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:2:1) who had granted a\nhymn (to the worshipper). Agni is my protection; therewith he is satisfied.\nThey took pleasure in all his [2](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:2:2) works--(in the\nworks) of the singer who brought praise.\n\n3\\. Whom the worshipful (gods) [1](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:3:1) took and placed\nin his own seat (as priest) with their praises: him they\n[2](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:3:2) have carried forward, taking hold of him in\ntheir search, hastening like horses that draw a chariot.\n\n4\\. The marvellous one destroys many things with his jaws. Then\n[1](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:4:1) the resplendent one shines in the forest. Then\nthe wind blows after his flame day by day as after the arrow of an archer,\nafter a weapon that has been shot.\n\n5\\. Him whom no impostors, no harmful foes [1](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:5:1), no\nharm-doers may harm when he dwells in (his mother's) womb, him the blind ones\nbereft of sight did not damage by looking at him\n[2](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:5:2). His own friends have protected him.\n\np. 174\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 1 = MS. IV, 14, 15.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The first Pada is identical with the first Pada of I, 71, 4 (see our\nnote there) with the exception of the word vish _t_ a _h_ , instead of which\nthat parallel passage has the reading vi-bh _ri_ ta _h_. It seems impossible\nto explain vish _t_ a _h_ , and the concurrence of the metrical irregularity\nin the same part of the Pada--though metrical irregularities are not\ninfrequent in this hymn--invites to a correction of the text. If vi-bh _ri_ ta\n_h_ in I, 71, 4 (see note there) refers to Matari _s_ van, which I consider as\ndoubtful, it would be easy to find for our passage an equivalent of that word\nlittle differing from the traditional vish _t_ a _h_ , namely, visthita _h_ :\n'when Matari _s_ van, standing in different places, had produced him by\nattrition.' Of course whoever adopts a conjecture like this, can scarcely\navoid understanding vi-bh _ri_ ta _h_ in I, 71, 4 as an epithet of Matari _s_\nvan, not of Agni. Another way to correct our passage would be to put into the\ntext a form derived from the root vish, 'to accomplish a work,' for instance,\nvish _t_ ya\xc2\xb4 (to be read as trisyllabic): 'when Matari _s_ van by his effort,'\n&c. Grassmann's vi-sita _h_ is quite improbable.\n\nNote 2. Vi _s_ va-apsum (Sa _m_ hita text, vi _s_ va\xc2\xb4psum), evidently an\nepithet of Agni the Hot _ri_ , seems corrupt. Shall we read vi _s_ va-psum\n('endowed with all food')--comp. VIII, 22, 12. havam vi _s_ vapsum vi _s_\nvavaryam--or vi _s_ va-pusham (Sa _m_ h., vi _s_ vapusham, 'all-nourishing')\nor vi _s_ va-apasam ('doing all works')? Also vi _s_ va-psnyam may be thought\nof. It is impossible, of course, to arrive at any certain conclusion.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. 'He' seems to be Agni. Saya _n_ a, however, explains: dadanam id\nagnaye kurva _n_ am eva mam. This would lead to a translation like this: '(The\nenemies) did\n\np. 175\n\nnot deceive (me, the worshipper) who had addressed a hymn (to Agni).'\n\nNote 2. On 'his' Saya _n_ a remarks, 'ya _g_ amanasya mama.' But the word may\nrefer to Agni.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. There is no reason for abandoning here the usual meaning of ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\niya. On the gods seeking after Agni, comp. Bergaigne, I, 110.\n\nNote 2. It is very probable, to say the least, that 'they' are again the gods.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Is the first a\xc2\xb4t dissyllabic? More probably the Pada is deficient by\none syllable.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Two syllables are wanting before the caesura of the first Pada.\n\nNote 2. Was there a belief that a blind man by turning his blind eyes on\nsomebody could do him harm? Possibly we might have to translate: 'Him (his\nfoes) blind and bereft of sight did not damage though looking at him (i. e.\nthough turning their blind eyes on him).'--Prof. Max Muller writes: 'Could it\nbe: Even the blind saw, but did not injure him (andha\xc2\xb4 _h_ apa _s_ yan na\ndabhan); abhikhya\xc2\xb4, when he was seen, no longer in the womb?'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 149](sbe46047.htm)\n\n"
