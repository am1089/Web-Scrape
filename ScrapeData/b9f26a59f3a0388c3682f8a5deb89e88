( _cont_.)\n\n51\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LI.\n\nIt is the same with numbers.\n\n51c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIf we read that, as in the case of fees to be given to priests, two, seven,\neleven, twelve, twenty-one, sixty, or a hundred, this means that either one or\nthe other, not that all should be given at the same time.\n\n52\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LII.\n\nBut accumulation is meant in the buying (of Soma), in the redemption, and in\ninitiation.\n\n52c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nWhen it is said that Soma is bought for a goat, gold, &c., that it is re-\nbought from the priests by means of a fee, or that at the time of the Diksha,\nthe purification and initiation of a sacrificer, clothes, gold, grain, &c.,\nshould be given, these are cases not of aut-aut but of et-et.\n\nThe Soma-plant, which is supposed to be bought from northern barbarians, is\nbotanically described in an \xc3\x82yur-vedic extract, quoted in the Dhurtasvami-\nbhashya _t_ ika (MS. E.I.H. 531, p. 3b), as\n\np. 330\n\n_s_ yamalamla _k_ a nishpatra kshiri _n_ i tva _k_ i ma _m_ sala, _s_ leshmala\nvamani valli somakhya _kh_ agabho _g_ anam. 'The creeper called Soma is dark,\nsour, without leaves, milky, fleshy on the surface, producing phlegm and\nvomiting, food for goats.'\n\nThis passage, quoted from some \xc3\x82yur-vedic text, is still the only one which\ngives an approximative description of the Soma-plant. Dr. Hooker says that the\npredicates 'sour and milky' point to Sarcostemma, but the question is not\ndecided yet. For further information see George Watt, The Soma Plant, an\nextract from the third volume of the Dictionary of Economic Products of India,\nand Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, pp. 14 seq.\n\n53\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LIII.\n\nIf one has performed an offering to Rudra, to the Rakshasas, to Nir _ri_ ti,\nor to the Pit _ri_ s, if one has cut or broken or thrown away anything, or\nrubbed oneself, &c., one should touch water.\n\n53c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe touching of water is for the sake of purification. Nirasana is left out in\nsome MSS. The _k_ a, inserted after abhimar _s_ anani, is explained, as usual,\nas including other acts also, corresponding to our etc.\n\n54\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LIV.\n\nAll priestly performances take place on the northern side of the Vihara.\n\n54c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nUttarata-upa _k_ ara _h_ has to be taken as a compound. Vihara is explained as\nvihriyante\xe0\xa4\xbdgnaya _h_ patra _n_ i _k_ a yasmin de _s_ e, i.e. the sacrificial\nground. Upa _k_ ara is explained as adhvaryvadina _m_ sa _m_ _k_ ara _h_ , and\nthis sa _m_ _k_ ara, according to Katyayana I, 3, 42, is the path between the\n_K_ atvala and Utkara, the Utkara being on the west, the pra _n_ itas on the\neast of the Vihara. Katyayana I, 8, 26, expresses the same rule by uttarata-\nupa _k_ aro ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_ , the vihara being the place where the ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\na takes place.\n\np. 331\n\n55\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LV.\n\nThe priest should never turn away from the fire, i.e. should never turn his\nback on the altar.\n\n56\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LVI.\n\nNor from the Vihara.\n\n57\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LVII.\n\nSacrificial utensils should be turned inside, the performers being outside.\n\n57c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe meaning is that the priest should carry such things is spoons, vessels,\n&c., holding them towards the altar. The sacrificer and his wife should\nlikewise be on the inside of the priest, and the priests should take\nprecedence sideways according to their rank.\n\n58\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LVIII.\n\nAfter a sacrificial object has been hallowed by a Mantra, the priest should\nnot toss it about.\n\n59\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LIX.\n\nSacrificial acts intended for the gods, should be performed by the priest\ntowards the east or towards the north, after he has placed the Brahmanic cord\nover the left and under the right arm (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ opavitin), and turning\ntowards the right.\n\n60\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LX.\n\nSacrificial acts intended for the Fathers should be performed by the priest\ntowards the south, after he has placed the Brahmanic cord over the right and\n\np. 332\n\nunder the left arm (pra _k_ inavitin), and turning towards the left.\n\n61\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXI.\n\nRopes which have to be joined, should be joined by the priest from left to\nright, after having tied them from right to left.\n\n62\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXII.\n\nRopes which are not joined (single ropes), should be tied by the priest from\nleft to right.\n\n62c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe exact process here intended is not quite clear. The ropes seem to have\nbeen made of vegetable fibres. See Katy. I, 3,15-17.\n\n63\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXIII.\n\nLet a man sacrifice with the Amavasya sacrifice at the time of the Amavasya,\nnew moon.\n\n63c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nAma-vasya is the dwelling together, i.e. the conjunction, of sun and moon, an\nastronomical expression which was adopted in the common language of the people\nat a very early time. It does not occur, however, in the _Ri_ g-veda. In our\nSutra amavasya is used in the sense both of new moon and new-moon sacrifice.\n\n64\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXIV.\n\nAnd let a man sacrifice with the Paur _n_ amasya sacrifice at the time of the\nPaur _n_ amasi, full moon, thus it is said.\n\n64c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nHere the full moon is called paur _n_ amasi, the sacrifice paur _n_ amasya.\nSatyavrata joins the two Sutras in one, and leaves out ya _g_ eteti, which may\nhave belonged to the commentary.\n\np. 333\n\n65\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXV.\n\nLet a man observe that full-moon day as a day of abstinence on which the moon\ncomes out full before.\n\n65c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe full moon (paur _n_ amasi) is really the very moment on which the moon is\nfull and therefore begins to decrease. That moment on which sun and moon are,\nas the Hindus said, at the greatest distance from each other, is called the\nparva-sandhi, the juncture of the two phases of the moon. Thus the name of\npaur _n_ amasi belongs to the last day of the one and to the first day\n(pratipad) of the other phase, and both days might be called paur _n_ amasi.\nIf therefore the moon is full on the afternoon, the evening, or the twilight\nof one day, that day should be observed as a fast-day, and the next day should\nbe the day of sacrifice.\n\nThe meaning of purastad, which I have translated by before, is doubtful. One\ncommentator says it has no object, and should be dropped, purastad ity etat\npadam asmin sutra idanim anvaya _m_ na labhate prayo _g_ anabhavat. Purastad,\nbefore, may, however, mean before the second day, on which the real sacrifice\ntakes place, and the commentator mentions purastat-paur _n_ amasi as a name of\nthe _k_ aturda _s_ i-yukta, i.e. the full moon beginning on the fourteenth\nday. The same kind of full moon is also called Anumati, Purva-paur _n_ amasi,\nand Sandhya-paur _n_ amasi, while that which takes place on the pratipad, the\nfirst day of the lunar phase, is called Raka, Uttara-paur _n_ amasi,\nAstamitodita, and _S_ va _h_ purita.\n\nCorresponding to these two kinds of Paur _n_ amasi there are also two kinds of\nAmavasya. That which falls on the fourteenth day is called Purva-amavasya, or\nSinivali, the \xe1\xbc\x95\xce\xbd\xce\xb7 \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xb1; that which falls on the pratipad, the first day of\nthe new phase, is called Kuhu, Uttara-amavasya. _S_ voyukta. See also\nAit.-Brahm. II, 4; Nir. XI, 31-32.\n\np. 334\n\n66\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXVI.\n\nOr the day when one says, To-morrow it will be full.\n\n66c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIn that case the day before should be observed as a day of abstinence. The\nreal full moon would then take place in the fore-noon, purvah _n_ e, of the\nnext day. Abstinence, upavasa, consists in abstaining from meat and from\nmaithuna, in shaving beard and head, cutting the nails, and, what seems a\ncurious provision, in speaking the truth. See Katy.- _S_ rauta-sutras II, I,\n8-12.\n\n67\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXVII.\n\nThe Va _g_ asaneyins mention a third, the Kharvika full moon.\n\n67c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nKharva means small. If one divides the night into twelve parts, and if in a\nportion of the twelfth part the greatest distance of sun and moon takes place,\nthen the full moon is called kharvika, also kshi _n_ a. Or, if on the\nsixteenth day, the full moon takes place before noon, that also is called\nkharvika paur _n_ amasi. In that case abstinence or fasting takes place on the\nsixteenth day (tasya _m_ sho _d_ a _s_ e\xe0\xa4\xbdhany upavasa _h_ ). Both paur _n_\namasis are also called sadyaskala.\n\n68\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXVIII.\n\nLet a man observe that new-moon day (amavasya) as a day of abstinence, on\nwhich the moon is not seen.\n\n68c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis Sutra has to be connected with Sutra LXV. The abstinence takes place on\nthe day, if the actual new moon, the nearest approach of sun and moon, falls\non the afternoon, at night, or at twilight. And this new moon, the junction of\nthe fifteenth day and the pratipad, is called Kuhu. We should read amavasyam.\n\np. 335\n\n69\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXIX.\n\nOr the day when one says, To-morrow they will not see it.\n\n69c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIn that case, when the real new moon takes place in the fore-noon, abstinence\nis observed on the day before, and the new moon is called Sinivali. Satyavrata\nreads _s_ vo yukta iti va instead of _s_ vo na drash _t_ ara iti va. Drash _t_\nara _h_ should be explained as ikshitara _h_ , 'they will not see it.' There\nis much difference of opinion on this subject among different _S_ akhas,\nSutrakaras, and their commentators; see Taitt. Sa _m_ h. III, 4, 9; Weber,\nInd. Stud., V, p. 228.\n\n70\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXX.\n\nThe principal acts (pradhana), prescribed in one (typical) performance, follow\nthe same special rules (vidhana).\n\n70c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis Sutra is variously explained: Satyavrata's commentary, which I have\nfollowed in the translation, explains pradhanani as agneyadini, i.e. the chief\nparts of such a sacrifice as the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa; vidhanani as a\xe1\xb9\x85gani.\nKapardisvamin's commentary also explains vidhanani as the a\xe1\xb9\x85gani of a\npradhanam; pradhanam as pur _n_ amasa, &c. It would therefore mean that such\nceremonies as the agneya (ash _t_ a-kapala), agnishomiya (ekada _s_ a-kapala),\nand upa _m_ _s_ u, which form the pradhanas of the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa,\nretain throughout the same vidhanas or a\xe1\xb9\x85gas as prescribed in one Prakara _n_\na, viz. the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa. The A\xe1\xb9\x85gas or members are all the things\nused for sacrificial purposes, milk, butter, grains, animals, &c.\n\n71\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXI.\n\nThe special rules are limited by (the purpose of) the (typical) performance\n(prakara _n_ a).\n\np. 336\n\n71c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nHere the rules (vidhis) are again the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas, which belong to a sacrifice, as\nthe members belong to the body.\n\n72\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXII.\n\nIf no special instruction is given (in the _S_ ruti), the acts are general.\n\n73\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXIII.\n\nIf a special instruction is given, they are restricted.\n\n73c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nNirde _s_ a is explained as vi _s_ esha- _s_ ruti, and the meaning is supposed\nto be that unless such a special rule is given, the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas of all the Pradhana\nacts remain the same, as, for instance, the Paryagnikara _n_ a, the Praya _g_\nas, &c. Special instructions are when it is said: payasa maitravaru _n_ a _m_\nsri _n_ ati, sruve _n_ a puro _d_ a _s_ am anakti, he cooks the Maitravaru _n_\na with milk, he anoints the Puro _d_ a _s_ a with the spoon, &c.\n\n74\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXIV.\n\nThe Ash _t_ a-kapala for Agni, the Ekada _s_ a-kapala for Agni-Shomau, and the\nUpa _m_ _s_ uyaga (the muttered offering of butter), form the principal acts\nat the Paur _n_ amasi, the full moon.\n\n74c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Ash _t_ a-kapala is the cake baked in eight cups, the Ekada _s_ a-kapala\nthat baked in eleven cups, and respectively destined for Agni and Soma. What\nis meant are the sacrificial acts for which these cakes are used.\n\n75\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXV.\n\nThe other Homas are A\xe1\xb9\x85ga.\n\n75c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe other acts, such as the praya _g_ as and anuya _g_ as, are auxiliary, and\nhave no promise of reward by themselves.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sutras 76-100](sbe30122.htm)\n\n"
