Sacrifice here, thou, O Agni, to the Vasus, the Rudras, and the \xc3\x82dityas,\nto the (divine) host that receives good sacrifices\n[1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:1:1), the Gh _ri_ ta-sprinkling offspring of Manu\n[2](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:1:2).\n\n2\\. The wise gods, O Agni, are ready to listen to the worshippers: conduct\nthem hither, the thirty-three, O lord of red horses, thou who lovest our\npraises.\n\n3\\. As thou hast heard Priyamedha and Atri [1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:3:1), O\n_G_ atavedas, as thou hast heard Virupa and A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, thus hear the invocation\nof Praska _n_ va, O lord of high laws.\n\n4\\. The Mahikerus [1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:4:1), the Priyamedhas have invoked\nfor their protection the lord of worship, Agni with his bright splendour.\n\n5\\. O thou to whom Gh _ri_ ta oblations are poured out, good (Agni), hear\nthese praises with which the sons of Ka _n_ va invoke thee for their\nprotection.\n\n6\\. O Agni, whose glory is brightest, beloved of many, the people in the clans\ninvoke thee, the radiant-haired, to convey the sacrificial food.\n\n7\\. The priests have established thee, O Agni, in the striving for day\n[1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:7:1), as their Hot _ri_ , the ministrant, the\ngreatest acquirer of wealth, with attentive ears, the most widely extended\n[2](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:7:2).\n\n8\\. The wise who have pressed Soma have made thee speed hither to the feast\n(which is offered to the gods), bringing great light\n[1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:8:1) and sacrificial food, O Agni, on behalf of the\nmortal worshipper.\n\np. 43\n\n9\\. O strength-made, good (Agni), make the gods who come in the morning, the\ndivine host, sit down here to-day on our sacrificial grass, O Vasu, to drink\nthe Soma.\n\n10\\. Sacrifice, O Agni, with joint invocations, and bring hither the divine\nhost. This is the Soma, O rain-giving gods. Drink (the Soma) which has been\nkept over night [1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:10:1).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe hymn is ascribed to Praska _n_ va. It is evidently addressed to Agni in\nhis matutinal character; comp. the note on I, 44. The metre is Anush _t_ ubh.\nVerse 1 = SV. I, 96. Verse 6 = VS. XV, 31; TS. IV, 4, 4, 3; MS. II, 13, 7.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VIII, 5, 33. a _k_ _kh_ a svadhvaram _g_ anam.\n\nNote 2. As to the gods being considered here as offspring of Manu, comp.\nespecially X, 53, 6. manu _h_ bhava _g_ anaya daivyam _g_ anam, 'become Manu,\nprocreate the divine hosts.' See also Bergaigne, Rel. Vedique, I, 69.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. This passage is one of those which show that the Atris stood in\nespecially friendly connection with the Ka _n_ vas. Of the Priyamedhas the\nsame may be said, or perhaps we may even go further and consider them as one\nbranch of the Ka _n_ vas. For a fuller discussion of these questions I refer\nto my paper, 'Ueber die Liedverfasser des Rig-veda,' Zeitschr. der D. Morg.\nGesellschaft, XLII, 213 seq.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Mahikerava _h_ , which I have translated as a proper name, may be an\nadjective belonging to Priyamedha _h_. Possibly it is derived from the root\nkar, 'to praise:' 'the\n\np. 44\n\n[paragraph continues] Priyamedhas with mighty hymns.' Comp. Bartholomae,\nKuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 341.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. As go-ish _t_ i means 'the striving for cows,' thus div-ish _t_ i\nmeans 'the striving for day,' or possibly 'the striving for heaven.' Ludwig\n(III, 383) takes it for 'morgenopfer,' and it is true that most of the\npassages, in which the word occurs, are addressed to matutinal deities. Thus\nour passage belongs to a hymn addressed to the matutinal Agni; I, 48, 9 is\naddressed to Ushas; I, 139, 4; VII, 74, 1; VIII, 87, 3 to the A _s_ vins; IV,\n46, I; 47, 1 to Vayu who was invoked in the Prauga- _s_ astra belonging to the\nPrata _h_ -savana, and who received the Soma offering before the other\ndeities. There is, nevertheless, at least one passage which shows that Ludwig\nhas gone too far: VIII, 76, 9. piba it indra marutsakha sutam somam divish _t_\nishu, 'Drink, O Indra, with the Maruts thy friends the Soma which has been\npressed at the divish _t_ is.' The Soma oblation offered to Indra Marutvat\nformed part of the second (midday) Savana.\n\nNote 2. 'Saprathastamam, the most renowned, repandu.' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Comp. IV, 5, 1. katha\xc2\xb4 da _s_ ema agnaye b _ri_ hat bha\xc2\xb4 _h_ , 'how\nmay we offer great light to Agni?'--which seems to mean, 'how may we make Agni\nbrilliant?' Thus in our passage the meaning seems to be: the priests kindle\nAgni and perform oblations.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. The tira _h_ -ahnya Soma, which was kept from one day to the next day\n(not, as Ludwig translates, 'der von vorgestern'), was offered to the A _s_\nvins at the Atiratra sacrifice. Comp. Rig-veda I, 47, 1; III, 58, 7; VIII, 35,\n19; Katyayana _S_ rautasutra XII, 6, 10; XXIV, 3, 42. There the commentary\nsays, a _s_ vina _s_ astrakayagasambandhina _h_ _k_ amasastha _h_ soma _h_\npurvadinanishpannatvat tirohnya ity u _k_ yante.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 58](sbe46012.htm)\n\n"
