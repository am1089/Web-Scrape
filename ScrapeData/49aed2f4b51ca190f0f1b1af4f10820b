VII.\n\nCreation continued. Production of the mind-born sons of Brahma; of the\nPrajapatis; of Sanandana and others; of Rudra and the eleven Rudras; of the\nManu Swayambhuva, and his wife \xc5\x9aatarupa; of their children. The daughters of\nDaksha, and their marriage to Dharma and others. The progeny of Disarms and\nAdharma. The perpetual succession of worlds, and different modes of mundane\ndissolution.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--From Brahma, continuing to meditate, were born mind-engendered\nprogeny, with forms and faculties derived from his corporeal nature; embodied\nspirits, produced from the person of that all-wise deity. All these beings,\nfront the gods to inanimate things, appeared as I have related to you 1, being\nthe abode of the three qualities: but as they did not multiply themselves,\nBrahma created other mind-born sons, like himself; namely, Bhrigu, Pulastya,\nPulaha, Kratu, Angiras, Marichi, Daksha, Atri, and Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha: these are the\nnine Brahmas (or Brahma rishis) celebrated in the Puran\xcc\x81as 2. Sanandana and\nthe other sons of\n\np. 50\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahma were previously created by him, but they were\nwithout desire or passion, inspired with holy wisdom, estranged from the\nuniverse, and undesirous of progeny. This when Brahma perceived, he was filled\nwith wrath capable of consuming the three worlds, the flame of which invested,\nlike a garland, heaven, earth, and hell. Then from his forehead,\n\np. 51\n\ndarkened with angry frowns, sprang Rudra 3, radiant as the noon-tide sun,\nfierce, and of vast bulk, and of a figure which was half male, half female.\nSeparate yourself, Brahma said to him; and having so spoken, disappeared.\nObedient to which command, Rudra became twofold, disjoining his male and\nfemale natures. His male being he again divided into eleven persons, of whom\nsome were agreeable, some hideous, some fierce, some mild; and he multiplied\nhis female nature manifold, of complexions black or white 4.\n\nThen Brahma 5 created himself the Manu Swayambhuva, born of, and identical\nwith, his original self, for the protection of created beings; and the female\nportion of himself he constituted \xc5\x9aatarupa, whom austerity\n\np. 52\n\npurified from the sin (of forbidden nuptials), and whom the divine Manu\nSwayambhuva took to wife. From these two were born two sons, Priyavrata\n\np. 53\n\nand Uttanapada 6, and two daughters, named Prasuti and \xc3\x81kuti,\n\np. 54\n\ngraced with loveliness and exalted merit 7. Prasuti he gave to Daksha, after\ngiving \xc3\x81kuti to the patriarch Ruchi 8, who espoused her. \xc3\x81kuti bore to Ruchi\ntwins, Yajna and Dakshina 9, who afterwards became husband and wife, and had\ntwelve sons, the deities called Yamas 10, in the Manwantara of Swayambhuva.\n\nThe patriarch Daksha had by Prasuti twenty-four daughters 11: hear from me\ntheir names: Sraddha (faith), Lakshmi (prosperity), Dhriti (steadiness),\nTusht\xcc\x81i (resignation), Pusht\xcc\x81i (thriving), Medha (intelligence), Kriya\n(action, devotion), Buddhi (intellect), Lajja (modesty), Vapu (body), Santi\n(expiation), Siddhi (perfection), Kirtti (fame): these thirteen daughters of\nDaksha, Dharma (righteousness) took to wife. The other eleven bright-eyed and\nyounger daughters of the patriarch were, Khyati (celebrity), Sati (truth),\nSambhuti (fitness), Smriti (memory), Priti (affection), Kshama (patience),\nSannati (humility), Anasuya (charity), \xc3\x9arjja (energy), with Swaha (offering),\nand Swadha (oblation). These maidens were respectively wedded to the Munis,\nBhrigu, Bhava, Marichi, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Atri, and\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha; to Fire (Vahni), and to the Pitris (progenitors) 12.\n\np. 55\n\nThe progeny of Dharma by the daughters of Daksha were as follows: by Sraddha\nhe had Kama (desire); by Lakshmi, Darpa (pride); by Dhriti, Niyama (precept);\nby Tusht\xcc\x81i, Santosha (content); by Pusht\xcc\x81i, Lobha (cupidity); by Medha, Sruta\n(sacred tradition); by Kriya, Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, Naya, and Vinaya (correction, polity,\nand prudence); by Buddhi, Bodha (understanding); by Lajja, Vinaya (good\nbehaviour); by Vapu, Vyavasaya (perseverance). Santi gave birth to Kshema\n(prosperity); Siddhi to Sukha (enjoyment); and Kirtti to Yasas (reputation\n13). These were the sons of Dharma; one of whom, Kama, had Hersha (joy) by his\nwife Nandi (delight).\n\nThe wife of Adharma 14 (vice) was Hinsa (violence), on whom he begot\n\np. 56\n\na son Anrita (falsehood), and a daughter Nikriti (immorality): they\nintermarried, and had two sons, Bhaya (fear) and Naraka (hell); and twins to\nthem, two daughters, Maya (deceit) and Vedana (torture), who became their\nwives. The son of Bhaya and Maya was the destroyer of living creatures, or\nMrityu (death); and Dukha (pain) was the offspring of Naraka and Vedana. The\nchildren of Mrityu were Vyadhi (disease), Jara (decay), Soka (sorrow),\nTrishn\xcc\x81a (greediness), and Krodha (wrath). These are all called the inflictors\nof misery, and are characterised as the progeny of Vice (Adharma). They are\nall without wives, without posterity, without the faculty to procreate; they\nare the terrific forms of Vishn\xcc\x81u, and perpetually operate as causes of the\ndestruction of this world. On the contrary, Daksha and the other Rishis, the\nelders of mankind, tend perpetually to influence its renovation: whilst the\nManus and their sons, the heroes endowed with mighty power, and treading in\nthe path of truth, as constantly contribute to its preservation.\n\nMAITREYA.--Tell me, Brahman, what is the essential nature of these\nrevolutions, perpetual preservation, perpetual creation, and perpetual\ndestruction.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Madhusudana, whose essence is incomprehensible, in the forms of\nthese (patriarchs and Manus), is the author of the uninterrupted vicissitudes\nof creation, preservation, and destruction. The dissolution of all things is\nof four kinds; Naimittika, \'occasional;\' Prakritika, \'elemental;\' Atyantika,\n\'absolute;\' Nitya, \'perpetual 15: The first, also\n\np. 57\n\ntermed the Brahma dissolution, occurs when the sovereign of the world reclines\nin sleep. In the second, the mundane egg resolves into the primary element,\nfrom whence it was derived. Absolute non-existence of the world is the\nabsorption of the sage, through knowledge, into supreme spirit. Perpetual\ndestruction is the constant disappearance, day and night, of all that are\nborn. The productions of Prakriti form the creation that is termed the\nelemental (Prakrita). That which ensues after a (minor) dissolution is called\nephemeral creation: and the daily generation of living things is termed, by\nthose who are versed in the Puran\xcc\x81as, constant creation. In this manner the\nmighty Vishn\xcc\x81u, whose essence is the elements, abides in all bodies, and\nbrings about production, existence, and dissolution. The faculties of Vishn\xcc\x81u\nto create, to preserve, and to destroy, operate successively, Maitreya, in all\ncorporeal beings and at all seasons; and he who frees himself from the\ninfluence of these three faculties, which are essentially composed of the\nthree qualities (goodness, foulness, and darkness), goes to the supreme\nsphere, from whence he never again returns.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[49:1](vp041.htm#fr_199) It is not clear which of the previous narratives is\nhere referred to, but it seems most probable that the account in p.\n[35](vp039.htm#page_35), [36](vp039.htm#page_36). is intended.\n\n[49:2](vp041.htm#fr_200) Considerable variety prevails in this list of\nPrajapatis, Brahmaputras, Brahmanas, or Brahmarshis; but the variations are of\nthe nature of additions made to an apparently original enumeration of but\nseven, whose names generally recur. Thus in the Mahabharata, Moksha Dharma, we\nhave in one place, Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, and\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, \'the seven highminded sons of the self-born Brahma.\' In another\nplace of the same, however, we have Daksha substituted for Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha: \'Brahma\nthen created mind-begotten sons, of whom Daksha was the seventh, with\nMarichi,\' &c. These seven sons of Brahma are also identified with the seven\nRishis as in the Vayu; although, with palpable inconsistency, eight are\nimmediately enumerated, or, Bhrigu, Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha,\nKratu, and Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. The Uttara Khanda of the Padma P. substitutes Kardama\nfor Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. The Bhagavata includes Daksha, enumerating nine. The Matsya\nagrees with Manu in adding Narada to the list of our text. The Kurma P. adds\nDharma and Sankalpa. The Linga, Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, and Vayu P. also add them, and\nextend the list to Adharma and Ruchi. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba in one place inserts\nGautama, and p. 50 in another Manu. Altogether therefore we have seventeen,\ninstead of seven. But the accounts given of the origin of several of these,\nshew that they were not originally included amongst the Manasa putras, or sons\nof Brahma\'s mind; for even Daksha, who finds a place in all the lists except\none of those given in the Mahabharata, is uniformly said to have sprung from\nBrahma\'s thumb: and the same patriarch, as well as Dharma, is included in some\naccounts, as in the Bhagavata and Matsya P., amongst a different series of\nBrahma\'s progeny, or virtues and vices; or, Daksha (dexterity), Dharma\n(virtue), Kama (desire), Krodha (passion), Lobha (covetousness), Moha\n(infatuation), Mada (insanity), Pramoda (pleasure), Mrityu (death), and Angaja\n(lust). These are severally derived from different parts of Brahma\'s body: and\nthe Bhagavata, adding Kardama (soil or sin) to this enumeration, makes him\nspring from Brahma\'s shadow. The simple statement, that the first Prajapatis\nsprang from the mind or will of Brahma, has not contented the depraved taste\nof the mystics, and in some of the Puran\xcc\x81as, as the Bhagavata, Linga, and\nVayu, they also are derived from the body of their progenitor; or, Bhrigu from\nhis skin, Marichi from his mind, Atri from his eyes, Angiras from his mouth,\nPulastya from his ear, Pulaha from his navel, Kratu from his hand, Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha\nfrom his breath, Daksha from his thumb, and Narada from his hip. They do not\nexactly agree, however, in the places whence these beings proceed; as for\ninstance, according to the Linga, Marichi springs from Brahma\'s eyes, not\nAtri, who there proceeds, instead of Pulastya, from his ears. The Vayu has\nalso another account of their origin, and states them to have sprung from the\nfires of a sacrifice offered by Brahma; an allegorical mode of expressing\ntheir probable original, considering them to be in some degree real persons,\nfrom the Brahmanical ritual, of which they were the first institutors and\nobservers. The Vayu P. also states, that besides the seven primitive Rishis,\nthe Prajapatis are numerous, and specifies Kardama, Ka\xc5\x9byapa, \xc5\x9aesha, Vikranta,\nSusravas, Bahuputra, Kumara, Vivaswat, Suchisravas, Prachetasa (Daksha),\nArisht\xcc\x81anemi, Bahula. These and many others were Prajapatis. In the beginning\nof the Mahabharata (A. P.) we have again a different origin, and first Daksha,\nthe son of Prachetas, it is said, had seven sons, after whom the twenty-one\nPrajapatis were born, or appeared. According to the commentator, the seven\nsons of Daksha were the allegorical persons Krodha, Tamas, Dama, Vikrita,\nAngiras, Kardama, and Aswa; and the twenty-one Prajapatis, the seven usually\nspecified Marichi and the rest, and the fourteen Manus. This looks like a\nblending of the earlier and later notions.\n\n[51:3](vp041.htm#fr_201) Besides this general notice of the origin of Rudra\nand his separate forms, we have in the next chapter an entirely different set\nof beings so denominated; and the eleven alluded to in the text are also more\nparticularly enumerated in a subsequent chapter. The origin of Rudra, as one\nof the agents in creation, is described in most of the Puran\xcc\x81as. The\nMahabharata, indeed, refers his origin to Vishn\xcc\x81u, representing him as the\npersonification of his anger, whilst Brahma is that of his kindness. The Kurma\nP. makes him proceed from Brahma\'s mouth, whilst engaged in meditating on\ncreation. The Varaha P. makes this appearance of Rudra the consequence of a\npromise made by \xc5\x9aiva to Brahma, that he would become his son. In the parallel\npassages in other Puran\xcc\x81as the progeny of the Rudra created by Brahma is not\nconfined to the eleven, but comprehends infinite numbers of beings in person\nand equipments like their parent; until Brahma, alarmed at their fierceness,\nnumbers, and immortality, desires his son Rudra, or, as the Matsya calls him,\nVamadeva, to form creatures of a different and mortal nature. Rudra refusing\nto do this, desists; whence his name Sthanu, from Stha, \'to stay.\' Linga, Vayu\nP. &c.\n\n[51:4](vp041.htm#fr_202) According to the Vayu, the female became first\ntwofold, or one half white, and the other black; and each of these, again,\nbecomes manifold, being the various energies, or \xc5\x9aaktis, of Mahadeva, as\nstated by the Kurma, after the words ### which are those of our text: ###. The\nLinga and Vayu specify many of their names. Those of the white complexion, or\nmild nature, include Lakshmi, Saraswati, Gauri, Uma, &c. Those of the dark\nhue, and fierce disposition, Durga, Kali, Chandi, Maharatri, and others.\n\n[51:5](vp041.htm#fr_203) Brahma, after detaching from himself the property of\nanger, in the form of Rudra, converted himself into two persons, the first\nmale, or the Manu Swayambhuva, and the first woman, or \xc5\x9aatarupa: so in the\nVedas; \'So himself was indeed (his) son.\' The commencement of production\nthrough sexual agency is here described with sufficient distinctness, but the\nsubject has been rendered p. 52 obscure by a more complicated succession of\nagents, and especially by the introduction of a person of a mythic or mystical\ncharacter, Viraj. The notion is thus expressed in Manu: "Having divided his\nown substance, the mighty power Brahma became half male and half female; and\nfrom that female he produced Viraj. Know me to be that person whom the male\nViraj produced by himself." I. 32, 33. We have therefore a series of Brahma,\nViraj, and Manu, instead of Brahma and Manu only: also the generation of\nprogeny by Brahma, begotten on Satarupa, instead of her being, as in our text,\nthe wife of Manu. The idea seems to have originated with the Vedas, as Kulluka\nBhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a quotes a text; \'Then (or thence) Virat was born.\' The procreation of\nprogeny by Brahma, however, is at variance with the whole system, which almost\ninvariably refers his creation to the operation of his will: and the\nexpression in Manu, \'he created Viraj in her,\' does not necessarily imply\nsexual intercourse. Viraj also creates, not begets, Manu. And in neither\ninstance does the name of \xc5\x9aatarupa occur. The commentator on Manu, however,\nunderstands the expression asrijat to imply the procreation of Viraj; and the\nsame interpretation is given by the Matsya Puran\xcc\x81a, in which the incestuous\npassion of Brahma for \xc5\x9aatarupa, his daughter in one sense, his sister in\nanother, is described; and by her he begets Viraj, who there is called, not\nthe progenitor of Manu, but Manu himself. This therefore agrees with our text,\nas far as it makes Manu the son of Brahma, though not as to the nature of the\nconnexion. The reading of the Agni and Padma P. is that of the Vishn\xcc\x81u; and\nthe Bhagavata agrees with it in one place, stating distinctly that the male\nhalf of Brahma, was Manu, the other half, \xc5\x9aatarupa: ### Bhagav. III. 12. 35:\nand although the production of Viraj is elsewhere described, it is neither as\nthe son of Brahma, nor the father of Manu. The original and simple idea,\ntherefore, appears to be, the identity of Manu with the male half of Brahma,\nand his being thence regarded as his son. The Kurma P. gives the same account\nas Manu, and in the same words. The Linga P. and Vayu P. describe the origin\nof Viraj and \xc5\x9aatarupa from Brahma; and they intimate the union of \xc5\x9aatarupa\nwith Purusha or Viraj, the male portion of Brahma, in the first instance; and\nin the second, with Manu, who is termed Vairaja, or the son of Viraj. The\nBrahma P., the words of which are repeated in the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, introduces a new\nelement of perplexity in a new name, that of \xc3\x81pava. According to the\ncommentator, this is a name of the Prajapati Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. As, however, he\nperforms the office of Brahma, he should be regarded as that divinity: but\nthis is not exactly the case, although it has been so rendered by the French\ntranslator. \xc3\x81pava becomes twofold, and in the capacity of his male half begets\noffspring by the female. Again, it is said Vishn\xcc\x81u created p. 53 Viraj, and\nViraj created the male, which is Vairaja or Manu; who was thus the second\ninterval (Antaram), or stage, in creation. That is, according to the\ncommentator, the first stage was the creation of \xc3\x81pava, or Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, or\nViraj, by Vishn\xcc\x81u, through the agency of Hiranyagarbha or Brahma; and the next\nwas that of the creation of Manu by Viraj. \xc5\x9aatarupa appears as first the bride\nof \xc3\x81pava, and then as the wife of Manu. This account therefore, although\nobscurely expressed, appears to be essentially the same with that of Manu; and\nwe have Brahma, Viraj, Manu, instead of Brahma and Manu. It seems probable\nthat this difference, and the part assigned to Viraj, has originated in some\nmeasure from confounding Brahma with the male half of his individuality, and\nconsidering as two beings that which was but one. If the Purusha or Viraj be\ndistinct from Brahma, what becomes of Brahma? The entire whole and its two\nhalves cannot coexist; although some of the Pauran\xcc\x81ics and the author of Manu\nseem to have imagined its possibility, by making Viraj the son of Brahma. The\nperplexity, however, is still more ascribable to the personification of that\nwhich was only an allegory. The division of Brahma into two halves designates,\nas is very evident from the passage in the Vedas given by Mr. Colebrooke, (As.\nR. VIII. 425,) the distinction of corporeal substance into two sexes; Viraj\nbeing all male animals, \xc5\x9aatarupa all female animals. So the commentator on the\nHari Van\xc5\x9ba explains the former to denote the horse, the bull, &c.; and the\nlatter, the mare, the cow, and the like. In the Bhagavata the term Viraj\nimplies, Body, collectively, as the commentator observes; \'As the sun\nilluminates his own inner sphere, as well as the exterior regions, so soul,\nshining in body (Viraja), irradiates all without and within.\' All therefore\nthat the birth of Viraj was intended to express, was the creation of living\nbody, of creatures of both sexes: and as in consequence man was produced, he\nmight be said to be the son of Viraj, or bodily existence. Again, \xc5\x9aatarupa,\nthe bride of Brahma, or of Viraj, or of Manu, is nothing more than beings of\nvaried or manifold forms, from Sata, \'a hundred,\' and \'form;\' explained by the\nannotator on the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba by Anantarupa, \'of infinite,\' and Vividharupa, \'of\ndiversified shape;\' being, as he states, the same as Maya, \'illusion,\' or the\npower of multiform metamorphosis. The Matsya P. has a little allegory of its\nown, on the subject of Brahma\'s intercourse with \xc5\x9aatarupa; for it explains the\nformer to mean the Vedas, and the latter the Savitri, or holy prayer, which is\ntheir chief text; and in their cohabitation there is therefore no evil.\n\n[53:6](vp041.htm#fr_204) The Brahma P. has a different order, and makes Vira\nthe son of the first pair, who has Uttanapada, &c. by Kamya. The commentator\non the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba quotes the Vayu for a confirmation of this account; but the\npassage there is, \'\xc5\x9aatarupa bore to the male Vairaja (Manu) two Viras,\' i. e.\nheroes or heroic sons, p. 54 Uttanpada and Priyavrata. It looks as if the\ncompiler of the Brahma P. had made some very unaccountable blunder, and\ninvented upon it a new couple, Vira and Kamya: no such person as the former\noccurs in any other Puran\xcc\x81a, nor does Kamya, as his wife.\n\n[54:7](vp041.htm#fr_205) The Bhagavata adds a third daughter, Devahuti; for\nthe purpose apparently of introducing a long legend of the Rishi Kardama, to\nwhom she is married, and of their son Kapila: a legend not met with any where\nelse.\n\n[54:8](vp041.htm#fr_206) Ruchi is reckoned amongst the Prajapatis by the Linga\nand Vayu Puran\xcc\x81as.\n\n[54:9](vp041.htm#fr_207) These descendants of Swayambhuva are all evidently\nallegorical: thus Yajna is \'sacrifice,\' and Dakshin\xcc\x81a \'donation\' to Brahmans.\n\n[54:10](vp041.htm#fr_208) The Bhagavata (b. IV. c. 1) says the Tushitas, but\nthey are the divinities of the second, not of the first Manwantara, as appears\nalso in another part of the same, where the Yamas are likewise referred to the\nSwayambhuva Manwantara.\n\n[54:11](vp041.htm#fr_209) These twenty-four daughters are of much less\nuniversal occurrence in the Puran\xcc\x81as than the more extensive series of fifty\nor sixty, which is subsequently described, and which appears to be the more\nancient legend.\n\n[54:12](vp041.htm#fr_210) The twenty-four daughters of Daksha are similarly\nnamed and disposed of in most of the Puran\xcc\x81as which notice them. The\nBhagavata, having introduced a third daughter. of Swayambhuva, has a rather\ndifferent enumeration, in order to assign some of them, the wives of the\nPrajapatis, to p. 55 Kardama and Devahuti. Daksha had therefore, it is there\nsaid (b. IV. c. 1), sixteen daughters, thirteen of whom were married to\nDharma, named Sraddha, Maitri (friendship), Daya (clemency), Santi Tusht\xcc\x81i,\nPusht\xcc\x81i, Kriya, Unnati (elevation), Buddhi, Medha, Titiksha (patience), Hri\n(modesty), Murtti (form); and three, Sati, Swaha, and Swadha, married, as in\nour text. Some of the daughters of Devahuti repeat these appellations, but\nthat is of slight consideration. They are, Kala (a moment), married to\nMarichi; Anasuya to Atri; Sraddha to Angiras; Havirbhu (oblation-born) to\nPulastya; Gati (movement) to Pulaha; Kriya to Kratu; Khyati to Bhrigu;\nArundhati to Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha; and Santi to Atharvan. In all these instances the\npersons are manifestly allegorical, being personifications of intelligences\nand virtues and religious rites, and being therefore appropriately wedded to\nthe probable authors of the Hindu code of religion and morals, or to the\nequally allegorical representation of that code, Dharma, moral and religious\nduty.\n\n[55:13](vp041.htm#fr_211) The same remark applies here. The Puran\xcc\x81as that give\nthese details generally concur with our text, but the Bhagavata specifies the\nprogeny of Dharma in a somewhat different manner; or, following the order\nobserved in the list of Dharma\'s wives, their children are, Rita (truth),\nPrasada (favour), Abhaya (fearlessness), Sukha, Muda (pleasure), Smaya\n(wonder), Yoga (devotion), Darpa, Artha (meaning), Smriti (memory), Kshema,\nPrasraya (affection), and the two saints Nara and Narayan\xcc\x81a, the sons of\nDharma by Murtti. We have occasional varieties of nomenclature in other\nauthorities; as, instead of \xc5\x9aruta, Sama; Kurma P.: instead of Dandanaya,\nSamaya; and instead of Bodha, Apramada; Linga P.: and Siddha in place of\nSukha; Kurma P.\n\n[55:14](vp041.htm#fr_212) The text rather abruptly introduces Adharma and his\nfamily. He is said by the commentator to be the son of Brahma, and the Linga\nP. enumerates him among the Prajapatis, as well as Dharma. According to the\nBhagavata, he is the husband of Mrisha (falsehood), and the father of Dambha\n(hypocrisy) and Maya (deceit), who were adopted by Nirritti. The series p. 56\nof their descendants is also somewhat varied from our text; being in each\ndescent, however, twins which intermarry, or Lobha (covetousness) and Nikriti,\nwho produce Krodha (wrath) and Hinsa: their children are, Kali (wickedness)\nand Durukti (evil speech): their progeny are, Mrityu and Bhi (fear); whose\noffspring are, Niraya (hell) and Yatana (torment).\n\n[56:15](vp041.htm#fr_213) The three first of these are more particularly\ndescribed in the last book: the last, the Nitya, or constant, is differently\ndescribed by Col. Vans Kennedy (Ancient and Hindu Mythology, p. 224, note).\n"In the 7th chapter," he observes, "of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a four kinds of\nPralaya are described. The Naimittika takes place when Brahma slumbers: the\nPrakritika when this universe returns to its original nature: Atyantika\nproceeds from divine knowledge: and Nitya is the extinction of life, like the\nextinction of a lamp, _in sleep_ at night." For this last characteristic,\nhowever, our text furnishes no warrant; nor can it be explained to signify,\nthat the Nitya Pralaya means no more p. 57 than "a man\'s falling into a sound\nsleep at night." All the copies consulted on the present occasion concur in\nreading ### as rendered above. The commentator supplies the illustration,\n\'like the flame of a lamp;\' but he also writes, \'That which is the destruction\nof all that are born, night and day, is the Nitya, or constant.\' Again, in a\nverse presently following we have the Nitya Sarga, \'constant or perpetual\ncreation,\' as opposed to constant dissolution: \'That in which, oh excellent\nsages, beings are daily born, is termed constant creation, by those learned in\nthe Puran\xcc\x81as.\' The commentator explains this, \'The constant flow or succession\nof the creation of ourselves and other creatures is the Nitya or constant\ncreation: this is the meaning of the text.\' It is obvious, therefore, that the\nalternation intended is that of life and death, not of waking and sleep.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII](vp042.htm)\n\n'
