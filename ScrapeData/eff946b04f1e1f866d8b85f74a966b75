Naraya _n_ a said said :-- O Narada! I will tell you now the excellent\nanecdote of Svadha, pleasing to the Pitris and enhancing the fruits of the\nS\xc2\x92radh ceremony when foods are offered to the Pitris. Listen. Before the\ncreation, the Creator created seven Pitris. Four out of them are with forms\nand the other three are of the nature of Teja (light).\n\n\n\nNote :-- Kavyavahoanalah Somo Yamaschaivaryama tatha, Agni _s_ vattah Barhi\n_s_ adah Somapa Pitri Devatah. These seven Pitris are according to the other\nPura _n_ as. Seeing the beautiful and lovely forms of the Pitris, He made\narrangements for their food in the form of S\xc2\x92raddhas and\n\n\n\np. 977\n\n\n\nTarpa _n_ as, etc. (funeral ceremony and peace-offerings), etc. (S\xc2\x92radh,\nsolemn obsequies performed in honour of the manes of deceased ancestors.)\n\n\n\nTaking bath, performing S\xc2\x92radh ceremony upto Tarpa _n_ am (peace-offerings),\nworshipping the Devas and doing Sandhya thrice a day; these are the daily\nduties of the Brahma _n_ as. If any Brahma _n_ a does not perform daily the\nTrisandhyas, S\xc2\x92raddha, Tarpa _n_ am, worship and the reciting of the Vedas, he\nbecomes devoid of fire like a snake without any poison. He who does not\nperform the devotional service of the Devi, who eats food not offered to S\xc2\x92ri\nHari, who remains impure till death, is not entitled to do any karma\nwhatsoever. Thus, introducing the S\xc2\x92raddhas, etc., for the Pitris, Brahma went\nto His own abode. The Brahma _n_ as went on doing the S\xc2\x92raddhas for the\nPitris, but the Pitris could not enjoy them and so they remained without food\nand were not satisfied. They all, being hungry and sad, went to the Council of\nBrahma and informed Him everything from beginning to end. Brahma then created\nout of His mind one daughter very beautiful, full of youth and having a face\nlovely, as if equal to one hundred moons. That woman was best in all respects\nwhether in form, beauty, qualities or in learning. Her colour was white like\nthe white Champaka flower and her body was adorned all over with jewel\nornaments. This form was very pure, ready to grant boons, auspicious and the\npart of Prakriti. Her face was beaming with smiles; her teeth were very\nbeautiful and her body showed signs of Lak _s_ mi (i.e., of wealth and\nprosperity). Her name was Svadha. Her lotus-feet were situated on one hundred\nlotuses. She was the wife of the Pitris. Her face resembled that of a lotus\nand Her eyes looked like water lilies. She was born of the lotus born Brahma.\nThe Grand-father Brahma made over that daughter of the nature of Tu _st_ i\n(Contentment) to the hands of the Pitris and they were satisfied. Brahma\nadvised the Brahma _n_ as privately that whenever they would offer anything to\nthe Pitris, they should offer duly with the mantra Svadha pronounced at the\nend. Since then the Brahma _n_ as are offering everything to the Pitris, with\nthe Mantra Svadha uttered in the end. Svaha is laudable, when offerings are\npresented to the Gods and Svadha is commendable when offerings are made to the\nPitris. But in both the cases, Dak _s_ i _n_ a is essential. Without Dak _s_ i\n_n_ a (sacrificial fee), all sacrifices are useless and worthless. The Pitris,\nDevatas, Brahma _n_ as, the Munis, the Manus worshipped the peaceful Svadha\nand chanted hymns to Her with great love. The Devas, Pitris, Brahma _n_ as,\nall were pleased and felt their ends achieved when they got the boon from\nSvadha Devi. Thus I have told you everything about Svadha. It is pleasing to\nall. What more do you want to hear? Say. I will answer all your questions.\n\n\n\np. 978\n\n\n\n19\\. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Thou, the Best of the knowers of the Vedas! O Muni\nSattama! I want now to hear the method of worship, the meditation and the\nhymns of Svadha Devi. Kindly tell me all about this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n20-27. Naraya _n_ a said :-- You know everything about the all-auspicious\nDhyan, Stotra, as stated in the Vedas; then why do you ask me again? However I\nwill speak out this for the enhancement of knowledge. On the thirteenth day of\nthe Dark Fortnight in autumn when the Magha asterism is with the Moon and on\nthe S\xc2\x92raddha day. One should worship with care Svadha Devi; then one should\nperform S\xc2\x92raddha. If, out of vanity, a Brahmi _n_ performs S\xc2\x92radh without\nfirst worshipping Svadha Devi then he will never get the fruits of Tarpa _n_\nam or S\xc2\x92radh. \xc2\x93O Devi Svadhe! Thou art the mind-born daughter of Brahma,\nalways young and worshipped by the Pitris. Thou bestowest the fruits of\nS\xc2\x92raddh. So I meditate on Thee.\xc2\x94 Thus meditating, the Brahmi _n_ is to\npronounce the motto (mula mantra) and offer the Padyam, etc., on the\nS\xc2\x92alagrama stone or on the auspicious earthen jar. This is the ruling of the\nVedas. The motto is \xc2\x93Om Hrim, S\xc2\x92rim, Klim, Svadha Devyai Svaha.\xc2\x94 She should be\nworshipped with this Mantra. After reciting hymns to the Devi, one is to bow\ndown to the Svadha Devi. O Son of Brahma! O Best of Munis! O Skilled in\nhearing! I now describe the stotra which Brahma composed at the beginning for\nthe bestowal of the desired fruits to mankind. Listen.\n\n\n\nNaraya _n_ a said :-- The instant the Mantra Svadha is pronounced, men get at\nonce the fruits of bathing in the holy places of pilgrimages. No trace of sin\nexists in him at that time; rather the religious merits of performing the\nVajapeya sacrifice accrue to him.\n\n\n\n28-36. \xc2\x93Svadha,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Svadha,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Svadha,\xc2\x94 thrice this word if one calls to mind,\none gets the fruits of S\xc2\x92radh, Tarpa _n_ am, and Bali (offering sacrifices).\nSo much so, if one hears with devotion during the S\xc2\x92radh time the recitation\nof the hymn to Svadha, one gets, no doubt, the fruit of S\xc2\x92radh. If one recites\nthe Svadha mantra thrice every time in the morning, midday and evening, every\nday, one gets an obedient, chaste wife begetting sons. The following is the\nhymn (Stotra) to Svadha :-- \xc2\x93O Devi Svadhe! Thou art dear to the Pitris as\ntheir vital breaths and thou art the lives of the Brahma _n_ as. Thou art the\nPresiding Deity of the S\xc2\x92radh ceremonies and bestowest the fruits thereof. O\nThou of good vows! Thou art eternal, true, and of the nature of religious\nmerits. Thou appearest in creation and disappearest in dissolution. And this\nappearing and disappearing go on forever. Thou art Om, thou art Svasti, Thou\nart Namas Kara (salutation); Thou art Svadha, Thou art Dak _s_ i _n_ a, Thou\nart the various works as designated in the Vedas. These the Lord of the world\nhas\n\n\n\np. 979\n\n\n\ncreated for the success of actions.\xc2\x94 No sooner Brahma, seated in His assembly\nin the Brahma Loka, reciting this stotra remained silent, than Svadha Devi\nappeared there all at once. When Brahma handed over the lotus-faced Svadha\nDevi over to the hands of the Pitris, and they gladly took Her to their own\nabodes. He who hears with devotion and attention this stotra of Svadha, gets\nall sorts of rich fruits that are desired and the fruits of bathing in all the\nTirthas.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Forty-fourth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the story of Svadha\nDevi in the discourse between Narada and Naraya _n_ a in the Maha Pura _n_ am\nS\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 45](bk09ch45.htm)\n\n'
