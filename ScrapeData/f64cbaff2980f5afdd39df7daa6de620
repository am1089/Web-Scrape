Adhik. I (1) 1 treats of what the study of the Vedanta\npresupposes. Adhik. II (2) defines Brahman as that whence the world\noriginates, and so on. Adhik. III (3) declares that Brahman is the source of\nthe Veda. Adhik. IV (4) proves Brahman to be the uniform topic of all Vedanta-\ntexts. Adhik. V (5-11) is engaged in proving by various arguments that the\nBrahman, which the Vedanta-texts represent as the cause of the world, is an\nintelligent principle, and cannot be identified with the non-intelligent\npradhana from which the world springs according to the Sankhyas.\n\nWith the next adhikara _n_ a there begins a series of discussions of\nessentially similar character, extending up to the end of the first adhyaya.\nThe question is throughout whether certain terms met with in the Upanishads\ndenote Brahman or some other being, in most cases the _g_ iva, the individual\nsoul. _S_ a _n_ kara remarks at the outset that, as the preceding ten Sutras\nhad settled the all-important point that all the Vedanta-texts refer to\nBrahman, the question now arises why the enquiry should be continued any\nfurther, and thereupon proceeds to explain that the acknowledged distinction\nof a higher Brahman devoid of all qualities and a lower Brahman characterised\nby qualities necessitates an investigation whether certain Vedic texts of\nprima facie doubtful import set forth the lower Brahman as the object of\ndevout meditation, or the higher Brahman as the object of true knowledge. But\nthat such an investigation is actually carried on in the remaining portion of\nthe first adhyaya, appears neither from the wording of the Sutras nor even\nfrom _S_ a _n_ kara's own treatment of the Vedic\n\np. xxxiii\n\ntexts referred to in the Sutras. In I, 1, 20, for instance, the question is\nraised whether the golden man within the sphere of the sun, with golden hair\nand beard and lotus-coloured eyes--of whom the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad speaks\nin I, 6, 6--is an individual soul abiding within the sun or the highest Lord.\n_S_ a _n_ kara's answer is that the passage refers to the Lord, who, for the\ngratification of his worshippers, manifests himself in a bodily shape made of\nMaya. So that according to _S_ a _n_ kara himself the alternative lies between\nthe sagu _n_ a Brahman and some particular individual soul, not between the\nsagu _n_ a Brahman and the nirgu _n_ a Brahman.\n\nAdhik. VI (12-19) raises the question whether the anandamaya, mentioned in\nTaittiriya Upanishad II, 5, is merely a transmigrating individual soul or the\nhighest Self. _S_ a _n_ kara begins by explaining the Sutras on the latter\nsupposition--and the text of the Sutras is certainly in favour of that\ninterpretation--gives, however, finally the preference to a different and\nexceedingly forced explanation according to which the Sutras teach that the\nanandamaya is not Brahman, since the Upanishad expressly says that Brahman is\nthe tail or support of the anandamaya 1.--Ramanu _g_ a's interpretation of\nAdhikara _n_ a VI, although not agreeing in all particulars with the former\nexplanation of _S_ a _n_ kara, yet is at one with it in the chief point, viz.\nthat the anandamaya is Brahman. It further deserves notice that, while _S_ a\n_n_ kara looks on Adhik. VI as the first of a series of interpretatory\ndiscussions, all of which treat the question whether certain Vedic passages\nrefer to Brahman or not, Ramanu _g_ a separates the adhikara _n_ a from the\nsubsequent part of the pada and connects it with what had preceded. In Adhik.\nV it had been shown that Brahman cannot be\n\np. xxxiv\n\nidentified with the pradhana; Adhik. VI shows that it is different from the\nindividual soul, and the proof of the fundamental position of the system is\nthereby completed 1.--Adhik. VII (20, 31) demonstrates that the golden person\nseen within the sun and the person seen within the eye, mentioned in _Kh_. Up.\nI, 6, are not some individual soul of high eminence, but the supreme Brahman.\n--Adhik. VIII (22) teaches that by the ether from which, according to _Kh_.\nUp. I, 9, all beings originate, not the elemental ether has to be understood\nbut the highest Brahman.--Adhik. IX (23). The pra _n_ a also mentioned in\n_Kh_. Up. I, ii, 5 denotes the highest Brahman 2\\--Adhik. X (24-27) teaches\nthat the light spoken of in _Kh_. Up. III, 13, 7 is not the ordinary physical\nlight but the highest Brahman 3.--Adhik. XI (28-31) decides that the pra _n_ a\nmentioned in Kau. Up. III, 2 is Brahman.\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA II.\n\nAdhik. I (1-8) shows that the being which consists of mind, whose body is\nbreath, &c., mentioned in _Kh_. Up. III, 14, is not the individual soul, but\nBrahman. The Sutras of this adhikara _n_ a emphatically dwell on the\ndifference of the individual soul and the highest Self, whence _S_ a _n_ kara\nis obliged to add an explanation--in his comment on Sutra 6--to the effect\nthat that difference is to be understood as not real, but as due to the false\nlimiting adjuncts of the highest Self.--The comment of Ramanu _g_ a throughout\nclosely follows the words of the Sutras; on Sutra 6 it simply remarks that the\ndifference of the highest Self\n\np. xxxv\n\nfrom the individual soul rests thereon that the former as free from all evil\nis not subject to the effects of works in the same way as the soul is 1.--\nAdhik. II (9, 10) decides that he to whom the Brahmans and Kshattriyas are but\nfood (Ka _th_ a. Up. I, 2, 25) is the highest Self.--Adhik. III (11, 12) shows\nthat the two entered into the cave (Ka _th_ a Up. I, 3, 1) are Brahman and the\nindividual soul 2.--Adhik. IV (13-17) shows that the person within the eye\nmentioned in _Kh_. Up. IV, 15, 1 is Brahman.--Adhik. V (18-20) shows that the\nruler within (antaryamin) described in B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 3 is Brahman. Sutra\n2,0 clearly enounces the difference of the individual soul and the Lord; hence\n_S_ a _n_ kara is obliged to remark that that difference is not real.--Adhik.\nVI (21-23) proves that that which cannot be seen, &c, mentioned in Mu _nd_ aka\nUp. I, 1, 3 is Brahman.--Adhik. VII (24-32) shows that the atman vai _s_\nvanara of _Kh_. Up. V, 11, 6 is Brahman.\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA III.\n\nAdhik. I (1-7) proves that that within which the heaven, the earth, &c. are\nwoven (Mu _nd_. Up. II, 2, 5) is Brahman.--Adhik. II (8, 9) shows that the\nbhuman referred to in _Kh_. Up. VII, 23 is Brahman.--Adhik. III (10-12)\nteaches that the Imperishable in which, according to B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 8,\nthe ether is woven is Brahman.--Adhik. IV (13) decides that the highest person\nwho is to be meditated upon with the syllable Om, according to Pra _s_ na Up.\nV, 5, is not the\n\np. xxxvi\n\nlower but the higher Brahman.--According to Ramanu _g_ a the two alternatives\nare Brahman and Brahma ( _g_ ivasa-mash _t_ irupo # _nd_ adhipati _s_ _k_\naturmukha _h_ ).--Adhik. V and VI (comprising, according to-- _S_ a _n_ kara,\nSutras 14-21) 1 discuss the question whether the small ether within the lotus\nof the heart mentioned in _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1 is the elemental ether or the\nindividual soul or Brahman; the last alternative being finally adopted. In\nfavour of the second alternative the purvapakshin pleads the two passages\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 3, 4 and VIII, 12, 3, about the serene being (samprasada); for\nby the latter the individual soul only can be understood, and in the chapter,\nof which the latter passage forms part, there are ascribed to it the same\nqualities (viz. freeness from sin, old age, death, &c.) that were predicated\nin VIII, 1, of the small ether within the heart.--But the reply to this is,\nthat the second passage refers not to the (ordinary) individual soul but to\nthe soul in that state where its true nature has become manifest, i.e. in\nwhich it is Brahman; so that the subject of the passage is in reality not the\nso-called individual soul but Brahman. And in the former of the two passages\nthe soul is mentioned not on its own account, but merely for the purpose of\nintimating that the highest Self is the cause through which the individual\nsoul manifests itself in its true nature.--What Ramanu _g_ a understands by\nthe avirbhava of the soul will appear from the remarks on IV, 4.\n\nThe two next Sutras (22, 23) constitute, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, a new\nadhikara _n_ a (VII), proving that he 'after whom everything shines, by whose\nlight all this is lighted' (Ka _th_ a Up. II, 5,15) is not some material\nluminous body, but Brahman itself.--According to Ramanu _g_ a the two Sutras\ndo not start a new topic, but merely furnish some further arguments\nstrengthening the conclusion arrived at in the preceding Sutras.) 2\n\np. xxxvii\n\nAdhik. VIII (24, 25) decides that the person of the size of a thumb mentioned\nin Ka _th_ a Up. II, 4, 12 is not the individual soul but Brahman.\n\nThe two next adhikara _n_ as are of the nature of a digression. The passage\nabout the a _n_ gush _th_ amatra was explained on the ground that the human\nheart is of the size of a span; the question may then be asked whether also\nsuch individuals as belong to other classes than mankind, more particularly\nthe Gods, are capable of the knowledge of Brahman: a question finally answered\nin the affirmative.--This discussion leads in its turn to several other\ndigressions, among which the most important one refers to the problem in what\nrelation the different species of beings stand to the words denoting them\n(Sutra 28). In connexion herewith _S_ a _n_ kara treats of the nature of words\n( _s_ abda), opposing the opinion of the Mima _m_ saka Upavarsha, according to\nwhom the word is nothing but the aggregate of its constitutive letters, to the\nview of the grammarians who teach that over and above the aggregate of the\nletters there exists a super-sensuous entity called 'spho _t_ a,' which is the\ndirect cause of the apprehension of the sense of a word (Adhik. IX; Sutras\n26-33).\n\nAdhik. X (34-38) explains that _S_ udras are altogether disqualified for\nBrahmavidya.\n\nSutra 39 constitutes, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, a new adhikara _n_ a (XI),\nproving that the pra _n_ a in which everything trembles, according to _K_ a\n_th_ a Up. II, 6, 2, is Brahman.--According to Ramanu _g_ a the Sutra does not\nintroduce a new topic but merely furnishes an additional reason for the\n\np. xxxviii\n\ndecision arrived at under Sutras 24, 25, viz. that the a _n_ gush _th_ amatra\nis Brahman. On this supposition, Sutras 24-39 form one adhikara _n_ a in which\n26-38 constitute a mere digression led up to by the mention made of the heart\nin 25.--The a _n_ gush _th_ amatra is referred to twice in the Ka _th_ a\nUpanishad, once in the passage discussed (II, 4, 12), and once in II, 6, 17\n('the Person not larger than a thumb'). To determine what is meant by the a\n_n_ gush _th_ amatra, Ramanu _g_ a says, we are enabled by the passage II, 6,\n2, 3, which is intermediate between the two passages concerning the a _n_ gush\n_th_ amatra, and which clearly refers to the highest Brahman, of which alone\neverything can be said to stand in awe.\n\nThe next Sutra (40) gives rise to a similar difference of opinion. According\nto _S_ a _n_ kara it constitutes by itself a new adhikara _n_ a (XII), proving\nthat the 'light' ( _g_ yotis) mentioned in _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 3 is the\nhighest Brahman.--According to Ramanu _g_ a the Sutra continues the preceding\nadhikara _n_ a, and strengthens the conclusion arrived at by a further\nargument, referring to Ka _th_ a Up. II, 5, 15--a passage intermediate between\nthe two passages about the a _n_ gush _th_ amatra--which speaks of a primary\nlight that cannot mean anything but Brahman. The Sutra has in that case to be\ntranslated as follows: '(The a _n_ gush _th_ amatra is Brahman) because (in a\npassage intervening between the two) a light is seen to be mentioned (which\ncan be Brahman only).'\n\nThe three last Sutras of the pada are, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, to be\ndivided into two adhikara _n_ as (XIII and XIV), Sutra 41 deciding that the\nether which reveals names and forms ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 14) is not the elemental\nether but Brahman; and 42, 43 teaching that the vi _g \xc3\xb1_anamaya, 'he who\nconsists of knowledge,' of B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 7 is not the individual soul but\nBrahman.--According to Ramanu _g_ a the three Sutras make up one single\nadhikara _n_ a discussing whether the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad passage about the\nether refers to Brahman or to the individual soul in the state of release; the\nlatter of these two alternatives being suggested by the circumstance that the\nreleased soul is the subject of the passage immediately preceding ('Shaking\noff\n\np. xxxix\n\nall evil as a horse shakes off his hair,' &c.). Sutra 41 decides that 'the\nether (is Brahman) because the passage designates the nature of something\nelse,' &c. (i.e. of something other than the individual soul; other because to\nthe soul the revealing of names and forms cannot be ascribed, &c.)--But, an\nobjection is raised, does not more than one scriptural passage show that the\nreleased soul and Brahman are identical, and is not therefore the ether which\nreveals names and forms the soul as well as Brahman?--(The two, Sutra 42\nreplies, are different) 'because in the states of deep sleep and departing\n(the highest Self) is designated as different' (from the soul)--which point is\nproved by the same scriptural passages which _S_ a _n_ kara adduces;--and\n'because such terms as Lord and the like' cannot be applied to the individual\nsoul (43). Reference is made to IV, 4, 14, where all _g_ agadvyapara is said\nto belong to the Lord only, not to the soul even when in the state of release.\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA IV.\n\nThe last pada of the first adhyaya is specially directed against the Sa _n_\nkhyas.\n\nThe first adhikara _n_ a (1-7) discusses the passage Ka _th_ a Up. I, 3, 10;\n11, where mention is made of the Great and the Undeveloped--both of them terms\nused with a special technical sense in the _S_ a _n_ khya- _s_ astra, avyakta\nbeing a synonym for pradhana.-- _S_ a _n_ kara shows by an exhaustive review\nof the topics of the Ka _th_ a Upanishad that the term avyakta has not the\nspecial meaning which the Sa _n_ khyas attribute to it, but denotes the body,\nmore strictly the subtle body (sukshma _s_ arira), but at the same time the\ngross body also, in so far as it is viewed as an effect of the subtle one.\n\nAdhik. II (8-10) demonstrates, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, that the\ntricoloured a _g_ a spoken of in _S_ ve. Up. IV, 5 is not the pradhana of the\nSa _n_ khyas, but either that power of the Lord from which the world springs,\nor else the primary causal matter first produced by that power.--What Ramanu\n_g_ a\n\np. xl\n\nin contradistinction from _S_ a _n_ kara understands by the primary causal\nmatter, follows from the short sketch given above of the two systems.\n\nAdhik. III (11-13) shows that the pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a pa _\xc3\xb1 k_a _g_ ana _h_ mentioned in\nB _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 17 are not the twenty-five principles of the Sa _n_ khyas.\n--Adhik. IV (14, 15) proves that Scripture does not contradict itself on the\nall-important point of Brahman, i.e. a being whose essence is intelligence,\nbeing the cause of the world.\n\nAdhik. V (16-18) is, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, meant to prove that 'he who\nis the maker of those persons, of whom this is the work,' mentioned in Kau.\nUp. IV, 19, is not either the vital air or the individual soul, but Brahman.--\nThe subject of the adhikara _n_ a is essentially the same in Ramanu _g_ a's\nview; greater stress is, however, laid on the adhikara _n_ a being polemical\nagainst the Sa _n_ khyas, who wish to turn the passage into an argument for\nthe pradhana doctrine.\n\nThe same partial difference of view is observable with regard to the next\nadhikara _n_ a (VI; Sutras 19-22) which decides that the 'Self to be seen, to\nbe heard,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 5) is the highest Self, not the individual\nsoul. This latter passage also is, according to Ramanu _g_ a, made the subject\nof discussion in order to rebut the Sa _n_ khya who is anxious to prove that\nwhat is there inculcated as the object of knowledge is not a universal Self\nbut merely the Sa _n_ khya purusha.\n\nAdhik. VII (23-27) teaches that Brahman is not only the efficient or operative\ncause (nimitta) of the world, but its material cause as well. The world\nsprings from Brahman by way of modification (pari _n_ ama; Sutra 26).--Ramanu\n_g_ a views this adhikara _n_ a as specially directed against the Se _s_ vara-\nsa _n_ khyas who indeed admit the existence of a highest Lord, but postulate\nin addition an independent pradhana on which the Lord acts as an operative\ncause merely.\n\nAdhik. VIII (28) remarks that the refutation of the Sa _n_ khya views is\napplicable to other theories also, such as the doctrine of the world having\noriginated from atoms.\n\np. xli\n\nAfter this rapid survey of the contents of the first adhyaya and the succinct\nindication of the most important points in which the views of _S_ a _n_ kara\nand Ramanu _g_ a diverge, we turn to a short consideration of two questions\nwhich here naturally present themselves, viz., firstly, which is the principle\non which the Vedic passages referred to in the Sutras have been selected and\narranged; and, secondly, if, where _S_ a _n_ kara and Ramanu _g_ a disagree as\nto the subdivision of the Sutras into Adhikara _n_ as, and the determination\nof the Vedic passages discussed in the Sutras, there are to be met with any\nindications enabling us to determine which of the two commentators is right.\n(The more general question as to how far the Sutras favour either _S_ a _n_\nkara's or Ramanu _g_ a's general views cannot be considered at present.)\n\nThe Hindu commentators here and there attempt to point out the reason why the\ndiscussion of a certain Vedic passage is immediately followed by the\nconsideration of a certain other one. Their explanations--which have\noccasionally been referred to in the notes to the translation--rest on the\nassumption that the Sutrakara in arranging the texts to be commented upon was\nguided by technicalities of the Mima _m_ sa-system, especially by a regard for\nthe various so-called means of proof which the Mima _m_ saka employs for the\npurpose of determining the proper meaning and position of scriptural passages.\nBut that this was the guiding principle, is rendered altogether improbable by\na simple tabular statement of the Vedic passages referred to in the first\nadhyaya, such as given by Deussen on page 130; for from the latter it appears\nthat the order in which the Sutras exhibit the scriptural passages follows the\norder in which those passages themselves occur in the Upanishads, and it would\ncertainly be a most strange coincidence if that order enabled us at the same\ntime to exemplify the various prama _n_ as of the Mima _m_ sa in their due\nsystematic succession.\n\nAs Deussen's statement shows, most of the passages discussed are taken from\nthe _Kh_ andogya Upanishad, so many indeed that the whole first adhyaya may be\nsaid to consist of a discussion of all those _Kh_ andogya passages of which it\n\np. xlii\n\nis doubtful whether they are concerned with Brahman or not, passages from the\nother Upanishads being brought in wherever an opportunity offers. Considering\nthe prominent position assigned to the Upanishad mentioned, I think it likely\nthat the Sutrakara meant to begin the series of doubtful texts with the first\ndoubtful passage from the _Kh_ andogya, and that hence the sixth adhikara _n_\na which treats of the anandamaya mentioned in the Taittiriya Upanishad has, in\nagreement with Ramanu _g_ a's views, to be separated from the subsequent\nadhikara _n_ as, and to be combined with the preceding ones whose task it is\nto lay down the fundamental propositions regarding Brahman's nature.--The\nremaining adhikara _n_ as of the first pada follow the order of passages in\nthe _Kh_ andogya Upanishad, and therefore call for no remark; with the\nexception of the last adhikara _n_ a, which refers to a Kaushitaki passage,\nfor whose being introduced in this place I am not able to account.--The first\nadhikara _n_ a of the second pada returns to the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad. The\nsecond one treats of a passage in the Ka _th_ a Upanishad where a being is\nreferred to which eats everything. The reason why that passage is introduced\nin this place seems to be correctly assigned in the _S_ ri-bhashya, which\nremarks that, as in the preceding Sutra it had been argued that the highest\nSelf is not an enjoyer, a doubt arises whether by that being which eats\neverything the highest Self can be meant 1.--The third adhikara _n_ a again,\nwhose topic is the 'two entered into the cave' (Ka _th_ a Up. I, 3, 1),\nappears, as Ramanu _g_ a remarks, to come in at this place owing to the\npreceding adhikara _n_ a; for if it could not be proved that one of the two is\nthe highest Self, a doubt would attach to the explanation given above of the\n'eater' since the 'two entered into the cave,' and the 'eater' stand under the\nsame prakara _n_ a, and must therefore be held to refer to the same matter.--\nThe fourth adhikara _n_ a is again occupied with a _Kh_ andogya passage.--The\nfifth adhikara _n_ a, whose topic is the Ruler within (antaryamin), manifestly\nowes its place, as remarked by Ramanu _g_ a also,\n\np. xliii\n\nto the fact that the Vedic passage treated had been employed in the preceding\nadhikara _n_ a (I, 2, 14) for the purpose of strengthening the argument 1.--\nThe sixth adhikara _n_ a, again, which discusses 'that which is not seen'\n(adre _s_ ya; Mu _nd_. Up. I, 1, 6), is clearly introduced in this place\nbecause in the preceding adhikara _n_ a it had been said that ad _ri_ sh _t_\na, &c. denote the highest Self;--The reasons to which the last adhikara _n_ a\nof the second pada and the first and third adhikara _n_ as of the third pada\nowe their places are not apparent (the second adhikara _n_ a of the third pada\ntreats of a _Kh_ andogya passage). The introduction, on the other hand, of the\npassage from the Pra _s_ na Upanishad treating of the akshara O _m_ kara is\nclearly due to the circumstance that an akshara, of a different nature, had\nbeen discussed in the preceding adhikara _n_ a.--The fifth and sixth adhikara\n_n_ as investigate _Kh_ andogya passages.--The two next Sutras (22, 23) are,\nas remarked above, considered by _S_ a _n_ kara to constitute a new adhikara\n_n_ a treating of the 'being after which everything shines' (Mu _nd_. Up. II,\n2, 10); while Ramanu _g_ a looks on them as continuing the sixth adhikara _n_\na. There is one circumstance which renders it at any rate probable that Ramanu\n_g_ a, and not _S_ a _n_ kara, here hits the intention of the author of the\nSutras. The general rule in the first three padas is that, wherever a new\nVedic passage is meant to be introduced, the subject of the discussion, i.e.\nthat being which in the end is declared to be Brahman is referred to by means\nof a special word, in most cases a nominative form 2. From this rule there is\nin the preceding part of the adhyaya only one real exception, viz. in I, 2, 1,\nwhich possibly may be due to the fact that there a new pada begins, and it\ntherefore was considered superfluous\n\np. xliv\n\nto indicate the introduction of a new topic by a special word. The exception\nsupplied by I, 3, 19 is only an apparent one; for, as remarked above, Sutra 19\ndoes not in reality begin a new adhikara _n_ a. A few exceptions occurring\nlater on will be noticed in their places.--Now neither Sutra 22 nor Sutra 23\ncontains any word intimating that a new Vedic passage is being taken into\nconsideration, and hence it appears preferable to look upon them, with Ramanu\n_g_ a, as continuing the topic of the preceding adhikara _n_ a.--This\nconclusion receives an additional confirmation from the position of the next\nadhikara _n_ a, which treats of the being 'a span long' mentioned in Ka _th_ a\nUp. II, 4, 12; for the reason of this latter passage being considered here is\nalmost certainly the reference to the alpa _s_ ruti in Sutra 21, and, if so,\nthe a _n_ gush _th_ amatra properly constitutes the subject of the adhikara\n_n_ a immediately following on Adhik. V, VI; which, in its turn, implies that\nSutras 22, 23 do not form an independent adhikara _n_ a.--The two next\nadhikara _n_ as are digressions, and do not refer to special Vedic passages.--\nSutra 39 forms anew adhikara _n_ a, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, but not\naccording to Ramanu _g_ a, whose opinion seems again to be countenanced by the\nfact that the Sutra does not exhibit any word indicative of a new topic. The\nsame difference of opinion prevails with regard to Sutra 40, and it appears\nfrom the translation of the Sutra given above, according to Ramanu _g_ a's\nview, that ' _g_ yoti _h_ ' need not be taken as a nominative.--The last two\nadhikara _n_ as finally refer, according to Ramanu _g_ a, to one _Kh_ andogya\npassage only, and here also we have to notice that Sutra 42 does not comprise\nany word intimating that a new passage is about to be discussed.\n\nFrom all this we seem entitled to draw the following conclusions. The Vedic\npassages discussed in the three first padas of the Vedanta-sutras comprise all\nthe doubtful--or at any rate all the more important doubtful--passages from\nthe _Kh_ andogya Upanishad. These passages are arranged in the order in which\nthe text of the Upanishad exhibits them. Passages from other Upanishads are\ndiscussed as opportunities offer, there being always a special reason why a\ncertain _Kh_ andogya passage is followed by\n\np. xlv\n\na certain passage from some other Upanishad. Those reasons can be assigned\nwith sufficient certainty in a number of cases although not in all, and from\namong those passages whose introduction cannot be satisfactorily accounted for\nsome are eliminated by our following the subdivision of the Sutras into\nadhikara _n_ as adopted by Ramanu _g_ a, a subdivision countenanced by the\nexternal form of the Sutras.\n\nThe fourth pada of the first adhyaya has to be taken by itself. It is directed\nspecially and avowedly against Sankhya-interpretations of Scripture, not only\nin its earlier part which discusses isolated passages, but also--as is brought\nout much more clearly in the _S_ ri-bhashya than by _S_ a _n_ kara--in its\nlatter part which takes a general survey of the entire scriptural evidence for\nBrahman being the material as well as the operative cause of the world.\n\nDeussen (p. 221) thinks that the selection made by the Sutrakara of Vedic\npassages setting forth the nature of Brahman is not in all cases an altogether\nhappy one. But this reproach rests on the assumption that the passages\nreferred to in the first adhyaya were chosen for the purpose of throwing light\non what Brahman is, and this assumption can hardly be upheld. The Vedanta-\nsutras as well as the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras are throughout Mima _m_ sa i.e.\ncritical discussions of such scriptural passages as on a prima facie view\nadmit of different interpretations and therefore necessitate a careful enquiry\ninto their meaning. Here and there we meet with Sutras which do not directly\ninvolve a discussion of the sense of some particular Vedic passage, but rather\nmake a mere statement on some important point. But those cases are rare, and\nit would be altogether contrary to the general spirit of the Sutras to assume\nthat a whole adhyaya should be devoted to the task of showing what Brahman is.\nThe latter point is sufficiently determined in the first five (or six)\nadhikara _n_ as; but after we once know what Brahman is we are at once\nconfronted by a number of Upanishad passages concerning which it is doubtful\nwhether they refer to Brahman or not. With their discussion all the remaining\nadhikara _n_ as of the\n\np. xlvi\n\nfirst adhyaya are occupied. That the Vedanta-sutras view it as a particularly\nimportant task to controvert the doctrine of the Sa _n_ khyas is patent (and\nhas also been fully pointed out by Deussen, p. 23). The fifth adhikara _n_ a\nalready declares itself against the doctrine that the world has sprung from a\nnon-intelligent principle, the pradhana, and the fourth pada of the first\nadhyaya returns to an express polemic against Sa _n_ khya interpretations of\ncertain Vedic statements. It is therefore perhaps not saying too much if we\nmaintain that the entire first adhyaya is due to the wish, on the part of the\nSutrakara, to guard his own doctrine against Sa _n_ khya attacks. Whatever the\nattitude of the other so-called orthodox systems may be towards the Veda, the\nSa _n_ khya system is the only one whose adherents were anxious--and actually\nattempted--to prove that their views are warranted by scriptural passages. The\nSa _n_ khya tendency thus would be to show that all those Vedic texts which\nthe Vedantin claims as teaching the existence of Brahman, the intelligent and\nsole cause of the world, refer either to the pradhana or some product of the\npradhana, or else to the purusha in the Sankhya sense, i.e. the individual\nsoul. It consequently became the task of the Vedantin to guard the Upanishads\nagainst misinterpretations of the kind, and this he did in the first adhyaya\nof the Vedanta-sutras, selecting those passages about whose interpretation\ndoubts were, for some reason or other, likely to arise. Some of the passages\nsingled out are certainly obscure, and hence liable to various\ninterpretations; of others it is less apparent why it was thought requisite to\ndiscuss them at length. But this is hardly a matter in which we are entitled\nto find fault with the Sutrakara; for no modern scholar, either European or\nHindu, is--or can possibly be--sufficiently at home, on the one hand, in the\nreligious and philosophical views which prevailed at the time when the Sutras\nmay have been composed, and, on the other hand, in the intricacies of the Mima\n_m_ sa, to judge with confidence which Vedic passages may give rise to\ndiscussions and which not.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxxii:1](sbe34003.htm#fr_5) The Roman numerals indicate the number of the\nadhikara _n_ a; the figures in parentheses state the Sutras comprised in each\nadhikara _n_ a.\n\n[xxxiii:1](sbe34003.htm#fr_6) Deussen's supposition (pp. 30, 150) that the\npassage conveying the second interpretation is an interpolation is liable to\ntwo objections. In the first place, the passage is accepted and explained by\nall commentators; in the second place, _S_ a _n_ kara in the passage\nimmediately preceding Sutra 12 quotes the adhikara _n_ a 'anandamayo #\nbhyasat' as giving rise to a discussion whether the param or the aparam\nbrahman is meant. Now this latter point is not touched upon at all in that\npart of the bhashya which sets forth the former explanation, but only in the\nsubsequent passage, which refutes the former and advocates the latter\ninterpretation.\n\n[xxxiv:1](sbe34003.htm#fr_7) Eva _m_ _g_ i _g \xc3\xb1_asitasya brahma _n_ a _s_ _k_\netanabhogyabhuta _g_ a _d_ arupasattvara _g_ astamomayapradhanad vyav _ri_\nttir ukta idani _m_ karmava _s_ vat trigu _n_ atmakaprak _ri_ tisa _m_\nsarganimittananavidhantadukhasagaranima _gg_ anena _s_ uddha _k_ _k_ a\npratyagatmano # nyan nikhilaheyapratayanika _m_ nirati _s_ ayanandam brahmeti\npratipadyate, anandamayo # bhyasat.\n\n[xxxiv:2](sbe34003.htm#fr_8) There is no reason to consider the passage 'atra\nke _k_ it' in _S_ a _n_ kara's bhashya on Sutra 23 an interpolation as Deussen\ndoes (p. 30). It simply contains a criticism passed by _S_ a _n_ kara on other\ncommentators.\n\n[xxxiv:3](sbe34003.htm#fr_9) To the passages on pp. 150 and 153 of the\nSanskrit text, which Deussen thinks to be interpolations, there likewise\napplies the remark made in the preceding note.\n\n[xxxv:1](sbe34003.htm#fr_10) _G_ ivaysa iva parasyapi brahma _n_ a _h_ _s_\narirantarvaititvam abbyupagata _m_ _k_ et tadvad eva _s_\narirasambandhaprayuktasukhadukhopabhogapraptir iti _k_ en na, hetuvai _s_\neshyat, na hi _s_ arirantarvartitvam eva sukhadukhopabhogahetu _h_ api tu pu\n_n_ yapaparupakarmaparava _s_ atva _m_ ta _k_ _k_ apahatapapmana _h_\nparamatmano na sambhavati.\n\n[xxxv:2](sbe34003.htm#fr_11) The second interpretation given on pp. 184-5 of\nthe Sanskrit text (beginning with apara aha) Deussen considers to be an\ninterpolation, caused by the reference to the Pai _n_ gi-upanishad in _S_ a\n_n_ kara's comment on I, 3, 7 p. 232). But there is no reason whatsoever or\nsuch an assumption. The passage on p. 232 shows that _S_ a _n_ kara considered\nthe explanation of the mantra given in the Pai _n_ gi-upanishad worth quoting,\nand is in fact fully intelligible only in case of its having been quoted\nbefore by _S_ a _n_ kara himself.--That the 'apara' quote the B _ri_ hadara\n_n_ yaka not according to the Ka _n_ va text--to quote from which is _S_ a _n_\nkara's habit--but from the Madhyandina text, is due just to the circumstance\nof his being an 'apara,' i.e. not _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\n[xxxvi:1](sbe34003.htm#fr_12) Sutras 14-21 are divided into two adhikara _n_\nas by the Adhikara _n_ aratnamala, but really constitute a simple adhikara _n_\na only.\n\n[xxxvi:2](sbe34003.htm#fr_13) Ita _s_ _k_ aitad evam.
