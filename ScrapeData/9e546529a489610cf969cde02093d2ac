Brahma said :-- \xc2\x93We were very much astonished not to find water where our\nbeautiful aeroplane landed us. We saw __ earth resonated with the sweet\ncooings of the cuckoos, filled with beautiful fruit-laden trees, forests and\ngardens. Big rivers, wells, tanks, ponds, water-springs, small pools, women,\nmen all are there. Next we saw, in front of us, a nice city enclosed by a\ndivine wall, containing many sacrificial halls and various palatial buildings\nand magnificent edifices. Oh! We thought :-- It is Heaven! What a great\nwonder! Who built this?\n\n\n\n6-11. Next we saw a king looking like a Deva is going out on a hunting\nexcursion in the forest. The Devi Ambika, Whom we saw before, is staying on\nthe chariot. In an instant, our aeroplane, propelled by air got high up above\nthe sky and reached in the twinkling of an eye at a lovely place. We saw there\na divine Nandana garden. There Surabhi, the cow of plenty, was staying under\nthe shade of the Parijata tree. Close by her, there was an elephant having\nfour tusks; and Menaka and other hosts of Apsaras were there with their\nvarious gestures and postures, playing, dancing and singing. There were\nhundred of Yak _s_ as, Gandharbhas, Vidyadharas within that Mandara garden\nplaying and singing. Within this there was the Lord Satakratu with S'achi, the\ndaughter of Puloma.\n\n\n\n12-34. Next we saw with great wonder, Varu _n_ a, the lord of the aquatic\nanimals, Kuvera, Yama, Surya (sun), fire and the other Devas; then we saw that\nin our front, Indra the Lord of the Devas, was coming out from a well\ndecorated city. He was there situated in his palanquin, calm and quiet and\ncarried by men. Then the car, where we were situated, began to\n\n\n\n\n\nget up high in the sky, and in the twinkling of an eye, we reached Brahma\nloka, that is saluted by all the Devas. There S'ambhu and Kes'ava were greatly\nbewildered to see Brahma of that place. In the council hall of Brahma, the\nVedas with their Angas, the serpents, hills, oceans and rivers were seen.\nSeeing all these, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'vara asked me :-- \xc2\x93O Four-faced one! Who\nis this eternal Brahma? I replied :-- I do not know who is this Brahma? Who am\nI? and who is He? why has this error come over me? You, too, also are gods so\nyou can better ponder over it.\xc2\x94 Next our car, going with the swiftness of mind\nwent, in the twinkling of an eye, to the beautiful all auspicious Kailas'a\nmountain surrounded by bliss-giving Yak _s_ as. It was beautified by the\nMandara garden, resonated by the sweet cooings of S'ukas and cuckoos and the\nsweet sounds of lutes and small drums and tabors. When we reached there we saw\nthe five faced, three-eyed Bhagavan S'ashi S'ekhara, with ten hands, wearing\ntiger skin, and the upper garment of the elephant skin. He was then, getting\nout of his abode, riding on a bull. His two sons, the great heroes, Ganes'a\nand Kartikeya, beautifully adorned, were attending Him as His body guards.\nNandi and all other hosts were following Him, chanting victories to Him. O\nMuni Narada! we were greatly wondered to see another S'ankara, surrounded by\nthe Matrikas. So much so, that perplexed with doubts, I sat down there. Next\nour aeroplane went on with the force of wind; and in an instant reached the\nabode of Vaiku _nt_ ha, the amusement court of Laksmi. O Suta! There at Vaiku\n_nt_ ha, we saw a wonderful manifestation of power. Our companion Vi _sn_ u\nwas greatly surprised to see that excellent city. We saw there four-armed Vi\n_sn_ u, of the colour of \xc3\x82tasi flower, wearing yellow garments, adorned with\ndivine ornaments sitting on Garu _d_ a. Lak _s_ mi Devi is fanning wonderful\nchowry to Him. Struck with wonder at the sight of the eternal Vi _sn_ u, we\ntook our seat on the car and looked at one another's face.\n\n\n\nNext the balloon ascended with the swiftness of wind; and, in the twinkling of\nan eye, reached to the ocean of nectar, the Sudha-Sagar, with waves playing\nsweetly on it. This ocean Sudha Sagara is filled with aquatic animals and\nagitated with ripples. We saw and went along and came to a very wonderful\nplace called the Ma _n_ i Dvipa (the island of gems) in the midst of the\nOcean. It was adorned with Mandara and Parijata an other heavenly flower trees\n(plants?), with various beautiful carpets, with variegated trees As'oka,\nVakula, Ketaki, Champaka, Kuravaka, etc., adorned with lustrous gems and\npearls. It was resonated with the sweet cooings of the cuckoos and the humming\nsounds of bees; and it presented the sight of a sweet harmonious music playing\nthere.\n\n\n\n35-67. Sitting on our aeroplane, we saw, from a distance, within that\n\n\n\np. 126\n\n\n\nDvipa, a __ beautiful cot known as S'ivakara (i.e. whose four legs represent\nBrahma, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra, etc., and whose top portion represents Sada S\xc2\x92iva\nlooking like a rainbow, with exquisitely beautiful carpet spread over it and\ndecked with various gems and jewels and inlaid with pearls. We saw a Divine\nLady, sitting on the cot, wearing a red garment __ and a garland of red cloth\nand bedewed with red sandal paste. Her eyes were dark-red; that beautiful\nfaced red-lipped lady looked more beautiful than ten millions of lightnings\nand ten millions of Lak _s_ mis and lustrous like the Sun. The Bhagavati\nBhuvanes'vari was sitting with a sweet smile on Her lips and holding in Her\nfour hands noose, goad, and signs indicating as if She was ready to grant\nboons and asking Her devotees discard all fear. We never saw before such a\nform. Even the birds of that place repeat the mystic incantation Hrim and\nserve that Lady, Who is of the colour of the rising Sun, all merciful, and in\nthe full bloom of youth. That lotus-faced smiling lady was adorned with all\nthe beauties of Nature. Her high breasts defied the lotus bud. She was holding\nvarious jewelled ornaments, e.g., armplates, bracelets, diadems, etc.\n\n\n\nHer lotus-face looked exceedingly beautiful with jewelled ear-rings of the\nshape of the S\xc2\x92ri Yantra (yantra of Tripura Sundari). Hrillekha and other Deva\ngirls were surrounding Her. There were Sakhis on the four sides -- always\nchanting hymns to Mahes'vari, the Lady of the world. She was surrounded on Her\nall sides by Ananga kusuma and other Devis. She was sitting in the middle of\nthe Satkona (six angled) Yantra. We were all wondered at the sight of this\nWonderful Form never seen before and we __ thought :-- \xc2\x93Who is this Lady? What\nis Her name? we know nothing of Her, from such a distance.\xc2\x94 Thus while we were\ngazing at Her, that four armed Lady became gradually thousand eyed, with\nthousand hands and thousand feet; so it seemed to us. O Narada! We became very\nmuch embarrassed with doubts and thought within ourselves \xc2\x93Is She Apsara\n(nymph) or a Gandharva daughter or any other Deva Girl? who is She ?\xc2\x94 At this\njuncture Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u saw closely the sweet smiling Devi and by his\nintelligence came to a definite conclusion and spoke to us :-- \xc2\x93This is the\nDevi Bhagavati Mahavidya Maha Maya, undecaying and eternal; She is the Full,\nthe Prakriti; She is the Cause of us all. This Devi is inconceivable to those\nwho are of dull intellects; only the Yogis can see Her by their Yoga-powers.\nShe is eternal (Brahma) and also non-eternal (Maya). She is the Will-force of\nthe Supreme Self. She is the First Creatrix of this world.\n\n\n\nThis Devi with wide eyes, the Lady of the Universe, has produced the Vedas.\nThe less-fortunate persons cannot worship Her. During the time of Pralaya, She\ndestroys all the Universe, draws within Her body all\n\n\n\np. 127\n\n\n\nthe subtle bodies (Linga-Sariras), and plays. O two Devas! At present She is\nresiding in the form of the Seed of the Universe. Behold! On Her sides are __\nseen duly all the Vibhutis (manifestations of powers). They are all adorned\nwith divine ornaments and anointed with divine scents and are serving __ Her.\nO Brahman! O S'ankara! To-day we are blessed and highly fortunate that we have\ngot the sight of this Devi. The tapasya (asceticisms) that we practised of\nyore have yielded to us this fruit. Else why Bhagavati has shown so carefully\nHer own form? Those who are highly meritorious by tapasyas and gifts of\nabundant wealth, those high souled persons are able to see this all-auspicious\nBhagavati. The person attached to sensual objects can never see Her. It is She\nthat is the Mula Prakriti, united with the Chidananda Person. It is She that\ncreates this Brahmanda and exhibits it to the Paramatma (the Supreme Self). O\ntwo Devas! This whole Universe and all the Seers and Seen and other things\ncontained therein owe to Her as their sole cause. She is the Maya assuming all\nforms; She is the Goddess of all. Where is I myself! Where are the Devas!\nWhere are Laksmi and the other Devis! We cannot compare to one-hundred\nthousandth part of Her. It is this all-excellent Lady, Whom I saw in the great\nOcean when She reckoned Me who was baby then with greatest gladness. In former\ndays, when I was sleeping on the cot made of immoveable fixed leaves of a\nbanyan tree and licking my toe, making it enter within my mouth and playing\nlike an ordinary baby, this Lady rocked my gentle body to and fro on the\nbanyan leaves singing songs like a Mother. Now I recollect all what I felt\nbefore at Her sight and recognise that She is the Bhagavati. These very things\nI now communicate to you. Hear attentively that She is __ this Lady and She is\n__ our Mother.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the third chapter of the Third Skandha on seeing the Devi in the\nMaha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyas.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4](bk03ch04.htm)\n\n"
