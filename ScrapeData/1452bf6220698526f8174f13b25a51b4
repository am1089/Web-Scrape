Janamejaya said :-- "O Muni! You told before that "the Highest Light took\nHer birth on the top of the Himalayas." Now describe to me in detail about\nthis Highest Light. What intelligent man\n\np. 702\n\ncan desist from hearing these nectar-like words about the S\'akti? The danger\nof death may come even to the Devas that drink nectars but no such danger can\npossibly come to those that drink the nectar of the Devi\'s glorious deeds.\n\n3-43. Vyasa said :-- "O King! You are blessed; you have attained what you are\nto attain in this life; you are taught by the high-souled men; you are\nfortunate since you are so sincerely devoted to the Devi. O King! Hear the\nancient history :--Wherever the Deva of the Devas, the Mahes\'vara rested while\nHe was wandering all over the world in a distracted state, carrying the Sati\'s\nbody that as burnt by fire, He spent his time there with his senses\ncontrolled, in Samadhi, forgetting all his knowledge of Samsara in deep\nmeditation of the form of the Devi. At this time, the three worlds, with their\nobjects, moving and immoving, with their oceans, mountains and islands became\nvoid of prosperity and power. The hearts of all the embodied beings became\ndried up, without any trace of joy; they were all burdened with anxious\nthoughts and remained indifferent. All were merged in the ocean of sorrows and\nbecame diseased. Planets retrograded and the Devas had their states reversed.\nThe Kings were attacked with a series of ills and misfortunes. \xc3\x82dhibhantik and\n\xc3\x82dhidaivik (from material causes and from divine interference). At this time a\ngreat Asura, named Taraka, became unconquerable owing to his receiving a boon\nfrom Brahma. Being intoxicated by his power and heroism, he conquered the\nthree worlds and became the sovereign ruler.The Brahma Prajapati, gave him\nboon to this effect that the legitimate son of S\'iva would be able to kill\nhim. And as at that time S\'iva had no son, the great Asura, elated with joy,\nbecame infatuated and carried off all victories. All the Devas were banished\nfrom their places by his oppression; they remained always anxious owing to the\nwant felt by them of a son of S\'iva. "S\'ankara has now no wife; how can He\nthen have a son! We are very unfortunate; how can our work be accomplished?\nThus oppressed with thoughts, all the Devas went to Vaiku _nt_ ha and informed\nthe Bhagava _n_ Vi _sn_ u of all that had happened, in privacy. The Bhagavan\nVi _sn_ u began to tell them the means, thus :-- "O Devas! Why are you all so\nanxious when the Auspicious Goddess of the Universe, the Dweller in the Ma _n_\ni Dvipa, the Yielder of all desires like a Kalpa Vrik _s_ a is always wakeful\nfor you. It is due to your faults that She is showing Her indifference; it is\nmeant to teach us (not for our destruction but to show Her Infinite mercy).\nWhen a mother nourishes and frightens and reprimands a son, it is not that she\nhas became merciless; so the World Mother, the Controller of the Universe,\nwill never be merciless to you as regards your qualifications and defects. A\nson commits offence at every step who can bear that in these three\n\np. 703\n\nworlds except the mother! So soon take refuge to the Highest Mother, the\nGoddess of the universe, with the sincerest devotion. She will certainly take\naction and help your cause. Thus ordering the Devas, Vi _sn_ u with His\nconsort Lak _s_ mi and the other Devas quickly went out to worship the Devi.\nGoing to the Himalayas, they soon engaged themselves in doing the Puras\'chara\n_n_ a Karma (act of repeating the names of the Deity, attended with burnt\noblations and offerings, etc.). O King! Those who were well versed with the\nperformance of sacrifice to the Mother, began their sacrificial ceremonies and\nall began to hold vows, _viz_ , Tritiyadi Vrata _n_ i. Some were engaged in\nincessantly meditating on the Devi; some began to repeat Her names constantly;\nsome began to repeat the Devi Sukta. Thus some devoted themselves to repeating\nnames; others to repeating mantrams. Again some wore engaged in performing\nsevere (painful) Chandraya _n_ a and other Vratas. Some were doing Antarayagas\n(inner sacrifices); some wore doing Pranagnihotra Yagas; whereas others\nengaged themselves in Nyasadi, etc. Again some began to worship the Highest\nS\'akti, the Goddess of the Universe, without any sleep or rest, by the seed\nmantra of Maya. O King! Thus many years of the Devas passed away. When the\nninth Tithi came in the month of Chaitra on Friday, the Highest Light of the\nSupreme Force suddenly appeared in front of them. That Light was equal to Ko\n_t_ i lightnings, of a red colour, and cool like the Ko _t_ i Moons. Again the\nlustre was like the Ko _t_ i Suns. The four Vedas personified, were chanting\nhymns all round Her. That mass of fire was above, below, on all sides, in the\nmiddle; nowhere it was obstructed. It had no beginning, nor end. It was of the\nform of a female with hands and feet and all the limbs. The appearance was not\nthat of a male nor that of an hermophrodite. The Devas, dazzled by the\nbrilliant lustre, first closed their eyes; but at the next moment, holding\npatience when they opened again their eyes, they found the Highest Light\nmanifesting in the form of an exceedingly beautiful Divine Woman. Her youth\nwas just blooming and Her rising breasts, plump and prominent, vying as it\nwere, with a lotus bud, added to the beauty all around. Bracelets were on Her\nhands; armlets on Her four arms; necklace on Her neck; and the garland made of\ninvaluable gems and jewels spread very bright lustre all arouud. Lovely\nornaments on Her waist making tinkling sounds and beautiful anklets were on\nHer feet. The hairs of Her head, flowing between Her ears and cheek sparkled\nbright like the large black bees shining on the flower leaves of the blooming\nKetaki flower. Her loins were nicely shaped and exquisitely lovely and the\nhairs on Her navel gave additional beauty. Her exquisitely lively lotus mouth\nrendered more lustrous and beautiful by the shining golden ear-ornaments, was\nfilled with betel leaves mixed with camphor, etc.; on Her forehead there was\n\np. 704\n\nthe half crescaut moon; Her eye-brows were extended and Her eyes looked bright\nand beautifully splendid like the red lotus; Her nose was elevated and Her\nlips very sweet. Her teeth were very beautiful like the opening buds of Kunda\nflowers; from Her neck was suspended a necklace of pearls; on Her head was the\nbrilliant crown decked with diamonds and jewels; on Her ears, earrings were\nsuspended like the lines on the Moon; Her hairs were ornamented with Mallika\nand Malati flowers; Her forehead was pasted with Ka _s_ mira Kunkuma drops;\nand Her three eyes gave unparallelled lustre to Her face. On Her one hand\nthere was the noose and on Her other hand there was the goad; her two other\nhands made signs granting boons and dispelling fears; Her body shed lustre\nlike the flowers of a Darima tree. Her wearing is a red coloured cloth. All\nthese added great beauty. Thus the Devas saw before them the Mother Goddess,\nthe Incarnate of unpretended mercy, with a face ready to offer Her Grace, the\nMother of the Whole Universe, the Enchantress of all, sweet-smiling, saluted\nby all the Devas, yielding all desires, and wearing a dress, indicative of all\nlovely feelings. The Devas bowed at once they saw Her; but they could not\nspeak with their voice as it was choked with tears. Then holding their\npatience, with much difficulty, they began to praise and chant hymns to the\nWorld Mother with their eyes filled with tears of love and devotion and with\ntheir heads bent low.\n\n44-54. The Devas said :-- We bow down to Thee, the Devi and the Maha Devi,\nalways obeisance to Thee! Thou art the Prak _r_ iti, and the Auspicious One;\nwe always salute to Thee. O Mother! Thou art of a fiery colour (residing as a\nRed Flame in the heart of a Yogi) and burning with Asceticism and Wisdom\n(shedding lustre all around). Thou art specially shining everywhere as the\nPure Chaitanya; worshipped by the Devas and all the Jivas) for the rewards of\ntheir actions; We take refuge to Thee, the Durga, the Devi, we bow down to\nThee, that can well make others cross the ocean of Samsara; so that Thou\nhelpest us in crossing this terrible ocean of world. Mother! The Devas have\ncreated the words ( _i.e._ , the words conveying ideas are uttered by the five\nVayus, Pra _n_ a, etc., which are called the Devas) which are of the nature of\nVis\'varupa, pervading everywhere, like the Kama Dhenu (the Heavenly Cow\nyielding all desires, riches, honor, food, etc.), and by which the brutes (the\ngods) become egotistical, O Mother! Thou art that language to us; so Thou\nfulfillest our desires when we praise and chant hymns to Thee. O Devi! Thou\nart the Night of Destruction at the end of the world; Thou art worshipped by\nBrahma; Thou art the Lak _s_ mi, the S\'akti of Vi _sn_ u; Thou art the Mother\nof Skanda; the S\'akti of S\'iva; Thou art the S\'akti Sarasvati of Brahma. Thou\nart Aditi,\n\np. 705\n\nthe Mother of the gods and Thou art Sati, the daughter of Dak _s_ a. Thus Thou\nart purifying the worlds in various forms and giving peace to all. We bow down\nto Thee. We know Thee to be the great Maha Lak _s_ mi; we meditate on Thee as\nof the nature of all the S\'aktis as Bhaghavati. O Mother! Illumine us so that\nwe can meditate and know Thee. O Devi! Obeisance to Thee, the Vira _t_!\nObeisance to Thee, the Sutratma, the Hira _n_ yagarbha; obeisance to Thee, the\ntransformed into sixteen Vikritis (or transformations). Obeisance to Thee, of\nthe nature of Brahma. We bow down with great devotion to Thee, the Goddess of\nthe Universe, the Creatrix of Mayic Avidya (the Nescience) under whose\ninfluence this world is mistaken as the rope as a garland is mistaken for a\nrope and again that mistake is corrected by whose Vidya.\n\nWe bow down to Thee who art indicated by both the letters Tat and Tvam in the\nsentence Tat Tvamasi (Thou art That), Tat indicating the Chit (Intelligence)\nof the nature of oneness and Tvam indicating the nature of Akha _nd_ a Brahma\n(beyond the Annamaya, Pra _n_ amaya, Manomaya, Vijnanamaya and the \xc3\x82nandamaya\n--the five Kos\'as, the Witness of the three states of wakefulness, dream, and\ndeep sleep states) and indicating Thee. O Mother! Thou art of the nature of\nPra _n_ ava Om; Thou art Hrim; Thou art of the nature of various Mantras and\nThou art merciful; we bow down again and again to Thy lotus Feet. When the\nDevas thus praised the Devi, the In-dweller of the Ma _n_ i Dvipa, the\nBhagavati spoke to them in a sweet cuckoo voice.\n\n55\\. O Devas! What for have you come here? What do you want? I am always the\nTree, yielding all desires to my Bhaktas; and I am ready to grant boons to\nthem.\n\n56-57. You are my devotees; why do you care, when I am on your side? I will\nrescue you from the ocean of troubles, O Devas! Know this as My true resolve.\nO King! Hearing these words of deep love, the Devas became very glad and gave\nout all their causes of troubles.\n\n58-65. O Parames\'vari! Thou art omniscient and witness of all these worlds.\nWhat is there in the three worlds that is not known to Thee! O Auspicious\nMother! The Demon Taraka is giving us troubles day and night. Brahma has given\nhim boon that he will be killed by the S\'iva\'s son. O Mahes\'vari! Sati, the\nwife of S\'iva has cast aside Her body. It is known to Thee. What will the\nignorant low people inform the one, Who is Omniscient? O Mother! We have\ndescribed in brief all what we had to say. What more shall we say? Thou\nknowest all our other troubles and causes of sorrows. Bless us so that our\ndevotion remains unflinched at Thy lotus feet; this is our earnest prayer.\nThat Thou\n\np. 706\n\ntakest the body to have a son of S\'iva is our fervent prayer to Thee. Hearing\nthe Dava\'s words, Parames\'vari, with a graceful countenance, spoke to them,\nthus :-- "My S\'akti will incarnate as Gauri in the house of Himalayas; She\nwill be the wife of S\'iva and will beget a son that will destroy Taraka De\n\nmon and will serve your purpose. And your devotion will remain steadfast at My\nLotus feet. Himalayas, too, is worshipping Me with his wholehearted devotion;\nso to take birth in his house is to my greatest liking; know this.\n\n66-73. Vyasa said :-- "O King! Hearing the kind words of the Devi, the King of\nmountains was filled with love; and, with voice choked with feelings and with\ntears in his eyes spoke to the Goddess of the world, the Queen. of the three\nworlds. Thou hast raised me much higher, that Thou dost me so great a favour;\notherwise where am I inert, and unmoving and where art Thou, of the nature of\nExistence, Intelligence and Bliss! It manifests the Greatness of Thy Glory. O\nSinless One! My becoming the father of Thee indicates nothing less than the\nmerits earned by me for doing, countless As\'vamedha sacrifices or for my\nendless Samadhi. Oh! What a favour hast Thou shewn towards me! Henceforth my\nunparalleled fame will be spread throughout the whole Universe of five\noriginal elements that "The Upholder of the Universe, the World Mother has\nbecome the daughter of this Himalayas! This man is blessed and fortunate!" Who\ncan be so fortunate, virtuous and merited as he whose daughter She has become,\nWhose belly contains millions of Brahma _nd_ as! I cannot describe what pre-\neminent heavens are intended for my Pitris, my family predecessors, wherein\nvirtuous persons like myself are born. O Mother! O Parames\'vari! Now describe\nto me Thy Real Self as exemplified in all the Vedantas; and also J\xc3\xb1ana with\nBhakti approved by the Vedas in the same way that Thou hast shown already this\nfavour to me, so that by That Knowledge I will be able to realise Thy Self.\n\n74\\. Vyasa said :-- "O King! Thus hearing the praise of Himalayas, the Goddess\nof the Universe, with a graceful look, began to speak the very secret essences\nof the S\'rutis.\n\nHere ends the Thirty-first Chapter of the Seventh Book on the birth of Parvati\nin the House of Himalayas in the Mahapura _n_ am S\'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 32](bk07ch32.htm)\n\n'
