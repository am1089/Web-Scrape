We implore [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:1) with well-spoken words the\nvigorous [2](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:2) Agni who belongs to many people\n[3](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:3), to the clans that worship the gods\n[4](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:4), whom other people (also) magnify.\n\n2\\. Men have placed Agni (on the altar) as the augmenter of strength. May we\nworship thee, rich in sacrificial food. Thus be thou here to-day gracious to\nus, a helper in our striving for gain, O good one!\n\n\n\n3\\. We choose thee, the all-possessor, as our messenger and as our Hot _ri_.\nThe flames of thee, who art great, spread around; thy rays touch the heaven.\n\n4\\. The gods, Varu _n_ a, Mitra, Aryaman, kindle thee, the ancient messenger.\nThe mortal, O Agni, who worships thee, gains through thee every prize.\n\n\n\n5\\. Thou art the cheerful Hot _ri_ and householder, O Agni, the messenger of\nthe clans. In thee all the firm laws are comprised which the gods have made\n[1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:5:1).\n\n6\\. In thee, the blessed one, O Agni, youngest god, all sacrificial food is\noffered. Sacrifice then thou who art gracious to us to-day and afterwards\n[1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:6:1), to the gods that we may be rich in valiant men.\n\n\n\n7\\. Him, the king, verily the adorers approach reverentially. With oblations\nmen kindle Agni, having overcome all failures.\n\n8\\. Destroying the foe [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:8:1), they (victoriously) got\nthrough Heaven and Earth and the waters; they\n\np. 32\n\nhave made wide room for their dwelling. May the manly (Agni)\n[2](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:8:2), after he has received the oblations, become\nbrilliant at the side of Ka _n_ va; may he neigh as a horse in battles.\n\n\n\n9\\. Take thy seat; thou art great. Shine forth, thou who most excellently\nrepairest to the gods. O Agni, holy god, emit thy red, beautiful smoke, O\nglorious one!\n\n10\\. Thou whom the gods have placed here for Manu as the best performer of the\nsacrifice, O carrier of oblations, whom Ka _n_ va and Medhyatithi, whom V _ri_\nshan and Upastuta [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:10:1) (have worshipped,) the winner\nof prizes.\n\n\n\n11\\. That Agni's nourishment has shone brightly whom Medhyatithi and Ka _n_ va\nhave kindled on behalf of _Ri_ ta [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:11:1). Him do these\nhymns, him do we extol.\n\n12\\. Fill (us with) wealth, thou self-dependent one, for thou, O Agni, hast\ncompanionship with the gods. Thou art lord over glorious booty. Have mercy\nupon us; thou art great.\n\n\n\n13\\. Stand up straight for blessing us, like the god Savit _ri_ , straight a\nwinner of booty, when we with our worshippers and with ointments\n[1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:13:1) call thee [2](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:13:2) in\nemulation (with other people).\n\n14\\. Standing straight, protect us by thy splendour from evil; burn down every\nghoul [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:14:1). Let us stand straight that we may walk\nand live. Find out our worship [2](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:14:2) among the gods.\n\n\n\n15\\. Save us, O Agni, from the sorcerer, save us from mischief, from the\nniggard. Save us from him\n\np. 33\n\nwho does us harm or tries to kill us, O youngest god with bright splendour!\n\n16\\. As with a club [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:16:1) smite the niggards in all\ndirections, and him who deceives us, O god with fiery jaws. The mortal who\nmakes (his weapons) very sharp by night, may that impostor not rule over us.\n\n\n\n17\\. Agni has won abundance in heroes, Agni prosperity (for Ka _n_ va). Agni\nand the two Mitras (i. e. Mitra and Varu _n_ a) have blessed Medhyatithi, Agni\n(has blessed) Upastuta in the acquirement (of wealth)\n[1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:17:1).\n\n18\\. Through Agni we call hither from afar Turva _s_ a, Yadu, and Ugradeva.\nMay Agni, our strength against the Dasyu, conduct Navavastva, B _ri_ hadratha,\nand Turviti [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:18:1).\n\n\n\n19\\. Manu has established thee, O Agni, as a light for all people. Thou hast\nshone forth with Ka _n_ va, born from _Ri_ ta, grown strong, thou whom the\nhuman races worship.\n\n20\\. Agni's flames are impetuous and violent; they are terrible and not to be\nwithstood. Always burn down the sorcerers, and the allies of the Yatus, every\nghoul [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:20:1).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe authorship of this hymn, and of the whole collection to which it belongs\n(I, 36-43), is ascribed to Ka _n_ va Ghaura. Numerous passages show indeed\nthat it was the family of the Ka _n_ vas, or rather, to speak more accurately,\na branch of that family, among which this group of hymns has been composed.\nBut it is as great a mistake in this as in\n\np. 34\n\na number of similar cases to accept the founder of one of the great\nBrahmanical families as an author of Vedic poems. Comp. Zeitschrift der\nDeutschen Morg. Gesellschaft, XLII, 215 seq.\n\nThe metre is alternately B _ri_ hati and Satob _ri_ hati, so that the hymn\nconsists of strophes (Pragatha) of two verses. Verse 1 = SV. I, 59. Verse 9 =\nVS. XI, 37; TS. IV, 1, 3, 3 (V, 1, 4, 5); T\xc3\x82r. IV, 5, 2 (V, 4, 6); MS. II, 7,\n3; IV, 9, 3. Verse 13 = SV. I, 57; VS. XI, 42; TS. IV, 1, 4, 2 (V, 1, 5, 3);\nMS. II, 7, 4. Verses 13, 14 = TB. III, 6, 1, 2; T\xc3\x82r. IV, 20, 1; MS. IV, 13, 1.\nVerse 19 = SV. I, 54.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Literally, we entreat for you. Comp. on this use of the pronoun va _h_\n, Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, 206. See also Neisser, Bezzenberger's\nBeitrage, XX, 64.\n\nNote 2. The meaning of yahva cannot be determined with full certainty.\n\nNote 3. There is no sufficient reason to change with Ludwig (IV, 254) puru _n_\na\xc2\xb4m to Puru _n_ a\xc2\xb4m, and thus to convert the metrically correct Pada into an\nirregular one.--Comp. Bollensen, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl.\nGesellschaft, XXII, 593.\n\nNote 4. On devayati\xc2\xb4nam, comp. Lanman, p. 399.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. 'On thee all the eternal works are united, i. e. depend, which the\ngods have wrought; such as sun, stars, lightning.' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. With the third Pada compare the third Pada of verse 2. It is a galita.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The word 'the foe' (v _ri_ tra) alludes to the name of the demon\nconquered by Indra; see H. O., Religion des Veda, 135, note 2.\n\np. 35\n\nNote 2. The metre would become more correct by reading v _ri_ shabha _h_\ninstead of v _r i_sha. Or V _r i_sha _n_ i, 'with V _ri_ shan'? Comp. verse\n10.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Medhyatithi or Medhatithi is very frequently mentioned in connection\nwith Ka _n_ va.\n\nV _ri_ shan is taken as a proper name by Boehtlingk-Roth and by Grassmann (not\nby Ludwig) in VI, 16, 15. Possibly they are right, but in no case can V _ri_\nshan of the sixth book, named by the side of Dadhya _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ and Atharvan, be\nidentified with any probability with the V _ri_ shan mentioned in our passage,\nwho evidently belongs to the ancestors of the Ka _n_ vas.\n\nUpastuta is mentioned again together with Ka _n_ va and Medhyatithi in verse\n17 of our hymn, together with Ka _n_ va in VIII, 5, 25. Comp. I, 112, 15;\nVIII, 103, 8; X, 115, 8. 9; Bergaigne, Rel. Ved., II, 448.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Comp. I, 139, 2. yat ha tyat mitravaru _n_ av _ri_ ta\xc2\xb4t adhi adada\xc2\xb4the\nan _ri_ tam svena manyuna; X, 73, 5. mandamana _h_ _ri_ ta\xc2\xb4t adhi.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. A _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ibhi _h_ can possibly mean 'who have salved themselves.'\nThere is no reason to think of the anointing of the yupa (sacrificial post),\nto which Saya _n_ a refers the word.\n\nNote 2. On vi-hva, comp. Pischel-Geldner, I, 144. There must be a technical\nreason, unknown to me, for the connection in which this verb repeatedly\noccurs, as is the case in our passage, with the noun vaghat: comp. III, 8, 10\n(see below); VIII, 5, 16. purutra\xc2\xb4 _k_ it hi vam nara vihvayante manishi _n_ a\n_h_ vaghadbhi _h_ a _s_ vina a\xc2\xb4 gatam.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. The exact meaning of atrin is unknown.\n\nNote 2. Geldner's conjectures on duvas seem rather bold\n\np. 36\n\nto me (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 233). Comp. vol. xxxii, pp. 203-206 (I, 165,\n14).\n\n##### Verse 16.\n\nNote 1. On ghaneva, see Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 334.\n\n##### Verse 17.\n\nNote 1. On Medhyatithi and Upastuta, see the note on verse 10. Aufrecht\n(Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVI, 612) believes that in mitrota an abbreviation of\nthe name Mitratithi (X, 33, 7) is contained; he translates: 'Agni has promoted\nMitratithi, Medhyatithi, and Upastuta in the acquirement of wealth.' This is\nvery ingenious, but I do not think that the reason which Aufrecht gives is\nsufficient: it cannot be understood, he says, why Mitra (or Mitra and Varu _n_\na) should be mentioned in a hymn exclusively addressed to Agni. But similar\ncases are quite frequent.--Prof. Max Muller writes: 'Could mitra stand for\nmitra _n_ i? Agni has protected his friends and also Medhyatithi.' Comp. also\nLanman, p. 342.\n\n##### Verse 18.\n\nNote 1. On Turva _s_ a and Yadu, comp. Muir, V, 286; Bergaigne, II, 354 seq.;\nZeitschr. der D. Morg. Ges. XLII, 220. There is not the slightest reason for\nLudwig's statement (IV, 254) that this hymn is a 'gebet um sig fur den auf\neinem kriegszuge befindlichen Turva\xc3\xa7akonig.'\n\nUgradeva is not mentioned again. On Navavastva and B _ri_ hadratha, comp. X,\n49, 6; VI, 20, 11; on Turviti, the materials collected by Bergaigne, Rel.\nVed., II, 358 seq.\n\n##### Verse 20.\n\nNote 1. See verse 14, note 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 44](sbe46010.htm)\n\n"
