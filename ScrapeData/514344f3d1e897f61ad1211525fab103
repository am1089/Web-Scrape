Be not effeminate, O son of P _ri_ tha! it is not\nworthy of you. Cast off this base weakness of heart, and arise, O terror of\n(your) foes!\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nHow, O destroyer of Madhu! shall I encounter with arrows in the battle Bhishma\nand Dro _n_ a--both, O destroyer of enemies! entitled to reverence? Not\n\np. 43\n\nkilling (my) preceptors--(men) of great glory--it is better to live even on\nalms in this world. But killing them, though they are avaricious of worldly\ngoods, I should only enjoy blood-tainted enjoyments. Nor do we know which of\nthe two is better for us-whether that we should vanquish them, or that they\nshould vanquish us. Even those, whom having killed, we do not wish to live--\neven those sons of Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra stand (arrayed) against us. With a\nheart contaminated by the taint of helplessness 1, with a mind confounded\nabout my duty, I ask you. Tell me what is assuredly good for me. I am your\ndisciple; instruct me, who have thrown myself on your (indulgence). For I do\nnot perceive what is to dispel that grief which will dry up my organs 2 after\nI shall have obtained a prosperous kingdom on earth without a foe, or even the\nsovereignty of the gods 3.\n\nSa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya said:\n\nHaving spoken thus to Hrishikesa, O terror of (your) foes! Gu _d_ ake _s_ a\nsaid to Govinda, 'I shall not engage in battle;' and verily remained silent.\nTo him thus desponding between the two armies, O descendant of Bharata! H _ri_\nshikesa spoke these words with a slight smile.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nYou have grieved for those who deserve no grief,\n\np. 44\n\nand you talk words of wisdom 1. Learned men grieve not for the living nor the\ndead. Never did I not exist, nor you, nor these rulers of men; nor will any\none of us ever hereafter cease to be. As, in this body, infancy and youth and\nold age (come) to the embodied (self) 2, so does the acquisition of another\nbody; a sensible man is not deceived about that The contacts of the senses 3,\nO son of Kunti! which produce cold and heat, pleasure and pain, are not\npermanent, they are ever coming and going. Bear them, O descendant of Bharata!\nFor, O chief of men! that sensible man whom they 4 (pain and pleasure being\nalike to him) afflict not, he merits immortality. There is no existence for\nthat which is unreal; there is no non-existence for that which is real. And\nthe (correct) conclusion about both 5 is perceived by those who perceive the\ntruth. Know that to be indestructible which pervades all this; the destruction\nof that inexhaustible (principle) none can bring about. These bodies\nappertaining to the embodied (self) which is eternal, indestructible, and\nindefinable, are said 6 to be perishable; therefore do engage in battle, O\ndescendant of Bharata! He who thinks it to be the killer and he who thinks\n\np. 45\n\nit to be killed, both know nothing. It kills not, is not killed 1. It is not\nborn, nor does it ever die, nor, having existed, does it exist no more.\nUnborn, everlasting, unchangeable, and primeval, it is not killed when the\nbody is killed 2. O son of P _ri_ tha! how can that man who knows it thus to\nbe indestructible, everlasting, unborn, and inexhaustible, how and whom can he\nkill, whom can he cause to be killed? As a man, casting off old clothes, puts\non others and new ones, so the embodied (self) casting off old bodies, goes to\nothers and new ones. Weapons do not divide it (into pieces); fire does not\nburn it, waters do not moisten it; the wind does not dry it up. It is not\ndivisible; it is not combustible; it is not to be moistened; it is not to be\ndried up. It is everlasting, all-pervading, stable, firm, and eternal 3. It is\nsaid to be unperceived, to be unthinkable, to be unchangeable. Therefore\nknowing it to be such, you ought not to grieve, But even if you think that it\nis constantly born, and constantly dies, still, O you of mighty arms! you\nought not to grieve thus. For to one that is born, death is certain; and to\none that dies, birth is certain 4. Therefore\n\np. 46\n\nabout (this) unavoidable thing, you ought not to grieve. The source of things,\nO descendant of Bharata! is unperceived; their middle state is perceived; and\ntheir end again is unperceived. What (occasion is there for any) lamentation\nregarding them 1? One looks upon it 2 as a wonder; another similarly speaks of\nit as a wonder; another too hears of it as a wonder; and even after having\nheard of it, no one does really know it 3. This embodied (self), O descendant\nof Bharata! within every one's body is ever indestructible. Therefore you\nought not to grieve for any being. Having regard to your own duty also, you\nought not to falter, for there is nothing better for a Kshatriya 4 than a\nrighteous battle. Happy those Kshatriyas, O son of P _ri_ tha! who can find\nsuch a battle (to fight)--come of itself 5\\--an open door to heaven! But if\nyou will not fight this righteous battle, then you will have abandoned your\nown duty and your fame, and you will incur sin. All beings, too, will tell of\nyour everlasting infamy; and to one who has been honoured, infamy is (a)\ngreater (evil) than death. (Warriors who are) masters of great cars will think\nthat you abstained from the battle through fear, and having been highly\nthought of by them, you will fall down to littleness. Your enemies, too,\n\np. 47\n\ndecrying your power, will speak much about you that should not be spoken. And\nwhat, indeed, more lamentable than that? Killed, you will obtain heaven;\nvictorious, you will enjoy the earth. Therefore arise, O son of Kunti!\nresolved to (engage in) battle. Looking alike on pleasure and pain, on gain\nand loss, on victory and defeat, then prepare for battle, and thus you will\nnot incur sin. The knowledge here declared to you is that relating to the Sa\n_n_ khya, 1. Now hear that relating to the Yoga. Possessed of this knowledge,\nO son of P _ri_ tha! you will cast off the bonds of action. In this (path to\nfinal emancipation) nothing that is commenced becomes abortive; no obstacles\nexist; and even a little of this (form of ) piety protects one from great\ndanger 2. There is here  3, O descendant of Kuru! but one state of mind\nconsisting in firm understanding. But the states of mind of those who have no\nfirm understanding are many-branched and endless. The state of mind consisting\nin firm understanding regarding steady contemplation 4 does not belong to\nthose, O son of P _ri_ tha! who are strongly attached to (worldly) pleasures\nand power, and whose minds are drawn away by that flowery talk which is full\nof (ordinances of) specific acts for the attainment of (those) pleasures and\n(that) power, and which promises\n\np. 48\n\nbirth as the fruit of acts 1\\--(that flowery talk) which those unwise ones\nutter, who are enamoured of Vedic words, who say there is nothing else, who\nare full of desires, and whose goal is heaven 2. The Vedas (merely) relate to\nthe effects of the three qualities 3; do you, O Ar _g_ una! rise above those\neffects of the three qualities, and be free from the pairs of opposites 4,\nalways preserve courage 5, be free from anxiety for new acquisitions or\nprotection of old acquisitions, and be self-controlled 6. To the instructed\nBrahma _n_ a, there is in all the Vedas as much utility as in a reservoir of\nwater into which waters flow from all sides 7. Your business is with action\nalone; not by any means with fruit. Let not the fruit of action be your motive\n(to action). Let not your attachment be (fixed) on inaction 8. Having recourse\nto devotion, O Dhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya! perform actions, casting off (all) attachment,\nand being equable in success or\n\np. 49\n\nill-success; (such) equability is called devotion. Action, O Dhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya!\nis far inferior to the devotion of the mind. In that devotion seek shelter.\nWretched are those whose motive (to action) is the fruit (of action). He who\nhas obtained devotion in this world casts off both merit and sin 1. Therefore\napply yourself to devotion; devotion in (all) actions is wisdom. The wise who\nhave obtained devotion cast off the fruit of action; and released from the\nshackles of (repeated)births 2, repair to that seat where there is no\nunhappiness 3. When your mind shall have crossed beyond the taint of delusion,\nthen will you become indifferent to all that you have heard or will heard 4.\nWhen your mind, confounded by what you have heard 5, will stand firm and\nsteady in contemplation 6, then will you acquire devotion.\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nWhat are the characteristics, O Kesava! of one whose mind is steady, and who\nis intent on contemplation? How should one of steady mind speak, how sit, how\nmove?\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nWhen a man, O son of P _ri_ tha! abandons all the\n\np. 50\n\ndesires of his heart, and is pleased in his self only and by his self 1, he is\nthen called one of steady mind. He whose heart is not agitated in the midst of\ncalamities, who has no longing for pleasures, and from whom (the feelings of)\naffection, fear, and wrath 2 have departed, is called a sage of steady mind.\nHis mind is steady, who, being without attachments anywhere, feels no\nexultation and no aversion on encountering the various agreeable and\ndisagreeable 3 (things of this world). A man's mind is steady, when he\nwithdraws his senses from (all) objects of sense, as the tortoise (withdraws)\nits limbs from all sides. Objects of sense draw back from a person who is\nabstinent; not so the taste (for those objects). But even the taste departs\nfrom him, when he has seen the Supreme 4. The boisterous senses, O son of\nKunti! carry away by force the mind even of a wise man, who exerts himself\n(for final emancipation). Restraining them all, a man should remain engaged in\ndevotion, making me his only resort. For his mind is steady whose senses are\nunder his control. The man who ponders over objects of sense forms an\nattachment to them; from (that) attachment is produced desire; and from desire\nanger is produced 5; from anger results want of discrimination 6; from want of\ndiscrimination,\n\np. 51\n\nconfusion of the memory; from confusion of the memory, loss of reason; and in\nconsequence of loss of reason. he is utterly ruined. But the self-restrained\nman who moves among 1 objects with senses under the control of his own self,\nand free from affection and aversion, obtains tranquillity 2. When there is\ntranquillity, all his miseries are destroyed, for the mind of him whose heart\nis tranquil soon becomes steady. He who is not self-restrained has no\nsteadiness of mind; nor has he who is not self-restrained perseverance 3 in\nthe pursuit of self-knowledge; there is no tranquillity for him who does not\npersevere in the pursuit of self-knowledge; and whence can there be happiness\nfor one who is not tranquil? For the heart which follows the rambling senses\nleads away his judgment, as the wind leads a boat astray upon the waters.\nTherefore, O you of mighty arms! his mind is steady whose senses are\nrestrained on all sides from objects of sense. The self-restrained man is\nawake, when it is night for all beings; and when all beings are awake, that is\nthe night of the right-seeing sage 4. He into whom all objects of desire\nenter, as waters enter the ocean, which, (though) replenished, (still) keeps\nits position unmoved,-he only obtains tranquillity; not he who desires (those)\nobjects of desire. The man who, casting\n\np. 52\n\noff all desires, lives free from attachments, who is free from egoism\n[1](sbe0805.htm#fn_151), and from (the feeling that this or that is) mine\n[2](sbe0805.htm#fn_152), obtains tranquillity. This, O son of P _ri_ tha! is\nthe Brahmic [3](sbe0805.htm#fn_153) state; attaining to this, one is never\ndeluded; and remaining in it in (one's) last moments, one attains (brahma-\nnirva _n_ a) the Brahmic bliss [4](sbe0805.htm#fn_154).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[43:1](sbe0804.htm#fr_106) The commentators say that 'heart' here signifies\nthe dispositions which are stated in chapter XVIII infra, [p.\n126](sbe0820.htm#page_126). The feeling. of 'helplessness' is incompatible\nwith what is there stated as the proper disposition for a Kshatriya.\n\n[43:2](sbe0804.htm#fr_107) I. e. by the heat of vexation; the meaning is,\n'which will cause constant vexation of spirit.'\n\n[43:3](sbe0804.htm#fr_108) I. e. if the means employed are the sinful acts\nreferred to.\n\n[44:1](sbe0804.htm#fr_109) Scil. regarding family-rites, &c.,. for, says\nNilaka _nth_ a, they indicate knowledge of soul as distinct from body.\n\n[44:2](sbe0804.htm#fr_110) A common word in the Gita, that which presides over\neach individual body.\n\n[44:3](sbe0804.htm#fr_111) Scil. with external objects.\n\n[44:4](sbe0804.htm#fr_112) I.e. the. 'contacts.'\n\n[44:5](sbe0804.htm#fr_113) The sense is this--there are two things apparently,\nthe soul which is indestructible, and the feelings of pain &c. which 'come and\ngo.' The true philosopher knows that the former only is real and exists; and\nthat the latter is unreal and non-existent. He therefore does not mind the\nlatter.\n\n[44:6](sbe0804.htm#fr_114) Scil. by those who are possessed of true knowledge.\n\n[45:1](sbe0804.htm#fr_115) Cf. Ka _th_ a-upanishad, p. 104.\n\n[45:2](sbe0804.htm#fr_116) Ka _th_ a-upanishad, pp. 103, 104.\n\n[45:3](sbe0804.htm#fr_117) 'Eternal.' Nilaka _nth_ a explains this by\n'unlimited by time, place,' &c. _S_ a _n_ kara and others as 'uncreated,'\n'without cause.' Stable =not assuming new forms; firm = not abandoning the\noriginal form. ( _S_ ridhara.) The latter signifies a slight change; the\nformer a total change.\n\n[45:4](sbe0804.htm#fr_118) Cf. the following from the Sutta Nipata (Sir M. C.\nSwamy's translation), pp. 124, 125: 'There is, indeed, no means by which those\nborn could be prevented from dying.' Even thus the world is afflicted with\ndeath and decay; therefore wise men, knowing the course of things in the\nworld, do not give way to grief.\n\n[46:1](sbe0804.htm#fr_119) Cf. Sutta Nipata, p. 125. 'In vain do you grieve,\nnot knowing well the two ends of him whose manner either of coming or going\nyou know not.'\n\n[46:2](sbe0804.htm#fr_120) I. e. the self spoken of above.\n\n[46:3](sbe0804.htm#fr_121) Ka _th_ a-upanishad, p. 96.\n\n[46:4](sbe0804.htm#fr_122) One of the warrior caste.\n\n[46:5](sbe0804.htm#fr_123) Without any effort, that is to say, of one's own.\n\n[47:1](sbe0804.htm#fr_124) Sa _n_ khya is explained in different modes by the\ndifferent commentators, but the resulting meaning here seems to be, that the\ndoctrine stated is the doctrine of true knowledge and emancipation by its\nmeans. See infra, p. 52.\n\n[47:2](sbe0804.htm#fr_125) Viz. this mortal mundane life.\n\n[47:3](sbe0804.htm#fr_126) I. e. for those who enter on this 'path.'\n\n[47:4](sbe0804.htm#fr_127) I.e. of the supreme Being; Yoga meaning really the\ndedication of all acts to that Being.\n\n[48:1](sbe0804.htm#fr_128) See Sutta Nipata, p. 4.\n\n[48:2](sbe0804.htm#fr_129) This is a merely temporary good, and not therefore\ndeserving to be aspired to before final emancipation.\n\n[48:3](sbe0804.htm#fr_130) I. e. the whole course of worldly affairs. As to\nqualities, see chapter XIV.\n\n[48:4](sbe0804.htm#fr_131) Heat and cold, pain and pleasure, and so forth. Cf.\nManu I, 26.\n\n[48:5](sbe0804.htm#fr_132) Cf. Sutta Nipata, p. 17 and other places.\n\n[48:6](sbe0804.htm#fr_133) Keeping the mind from worldly objects.\n\n[48:7](sbe0804.htm#fr_134) The meaning here is not easily apprehended. I\nsuggest the following explanation:--Having said that the Vedas are concerned\nwith actions for special benefits, K _ri_ sh _n_ a compares them to a\nreservoir which provides water for various special purposes, drinking,\nbathing, &c. The Vedas similarly prescribe particular rites and ceremonies for\ngoing to heaven, or destroying an enemy, &c. But, says K _ri_ sh _n_ a, man's\nduty is merely to perform the actions prescribed for him among these, and not\nentertain desires for the special benefits named. The stanza occurs in the\nSanatsu _g_ atiya, too.\n\n[48:8](sbe0804.htm#fr_135) Doing nothing at all.\n\n[49:1](sbe0804.htm#fr_136) Merit merely leads to heaven, as to which see note\non last page. Cf. Sutta Nipata, pp. 4, 136, 145 note.\n\n[49:2](sbe0804.htm#fr_137) Sutta Nipata, pp. 3-7, &c.\n\n[49:3](sbe0804.htm#fr_138) Sutta Nipata, p. 21.\n\n[49:4](sbe0804.htm#fr_139) This, according to \xc3\x82nandagiri, means all writings\nother than those on the science of the soul.\n\n[49:5](sbe0804.htm#fr_140) I. e. about the means for the acquisition of\nvarious desired things.\n\n[49:6](sbe0804.htm#fr_141) I. e. of the soul ( _S_ a _n_ kara), of the supreme\nBeing ( _S_ ridhara). Substantially they both mean the same thing.\n\n[50:1](sbe0804.htm#fr_142) I. e. pleased, without regard to external objects,\nby self-contemplation alone.\n\n[50:2](sbe0804.htm#fr_143) Cf. Sutta Nipata, p. 3.\n\n[50:3](sbe0804.htm#fr_144) The word _s_ ubha _s_ ubha in this sense also\noccurs in the Dhammapada, stanza 78, and in the Maitri-upanishad, p. 34.\n\n[50:4](sbe0804.htm#fr_145) See on this, Wilson's Essays on Sanskrit\nLiterature, vol. iii, p. 130.\n\n[50:5](sbe0804.htm#fr_146) I. e. when the desire is frustrated.\n\n[50:6](sbe0804.htm#fr_147) I. e. between right and wrong. Confusion of memory\n= forgetfulness of _S_ astras and rules prescribed in them.\n\n[51:1](sbe0804.htm#fr_148) Cf. Sutta Nipata, p. 45.\n\n[51:2](sbe0804.htm#fr_149) Cf. Maitri-upanishad, p. 134, where the commentator\nexplains it to mean freedom from desires.\n\n[51:3](sbe0804.htm#fr_150) For a somewhat similar use of the word bhavana in\nthis sense, comp. Dhammapada, stanza 301.\n\n[51:4](sbe0804.htm#fr_151) Spiritual matters are dark as night to the common\nrun of men, while they are wide awake in all worldly pursuits. With the sage\nthe case is exactly the reverse.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III](sbe0805.htm)\n\n"
