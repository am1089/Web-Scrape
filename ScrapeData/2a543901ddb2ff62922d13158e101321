Narada said :-- O Bhagavan! Thou art the ocean of mercy; kindly speak out\nto me in brief all the things and the duties to be observed and applied in the\nS\xc2\x92anti Karmas (the peace bringing acts) of Gayatri.\n\n\n\n2-20. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! The question asked by you is esoteric.\nNever divulge this to a wicked person or any hypocrite. It is to be kept\nsecret. While doing this S\xc2\x92anti Karma, the Brahma _n_ as are to perform the\nHomas with fuel soaked in milk (Paya _h_ ). If the fuel of the S\xc2\x92ami tree be\noffered in Homa ceremony, then diseases caused by planets are cured. If the\nHoma be performed with wet As\xc2\x92vaththa or Udumbara or other k _s_ ira trees,\nthe diseases caused by demons and hob-goblins are cured. If one offers Tarpa\n_n_ am with one palmful of water, repeating the mantra \xc2\x93Suryam Tarpayami nama\n_h_ \xc2\x94, the pending evils are also averted and troubles are ceased. The\nrepetition of the Gayatri mantra with knees immersed in water averts all\nevils. The repetition of Gayatri with body immersed in water upto the throat,\naverts the danger of life; and the same with whole body immersed grants all\nsuccess. This is the best of all the S\xc2\x92anti karmas, the acts that bring\nhealth, wealth, happiness and peace. While performing Homa, light with the\nfuel of K _s_ iravrik _s_ a (the trees that emit milky juice); place\nPa\xc3\xb1chagavya in a vessel made of gold, silver, copper or wood of k _s_ ira\ntrees, or in the vessels made of earth, without any knot or crack; utter the\nGayatri mantra and offer one thousand homas. Sprinkle with water at every\noffering, touching the Pa\xc3\xb1chagavya with Kus\xc2\x92a grass, thousand times. Then\noffer the sacrifices there where calamities or nuisances are seen and meditate\non the Highest Devata. Thus all the magic spells used by other persons for a\nmalevolent purpose will be rendered nugatory. Bring under your control any\nDeva yoni, Bhute Yoni, or Pis\xc2\x92acha Yoni that causes you troubles; then they\nwill quit the house, village, city, way, even that kingdom. Now hear how they\nare brought under control. Prepare a sacrificial altar with sand, draw a\nsquare on it, place a Sula (spear) in its centre and plaster with A _st_\nagandha. For the sake of converting all the evils, repeat Gayatri mantra\nthousand times and impregnate it with the mantra, dig the ground and place or\nbury the Sula under it. Place on the level ground or stha _nd_ ila a jar or\nNavaphala, a fruit made of gold, silver, or copper or a newly made earthen jar\nand enclose it with thread. Then have the sacred waters brought from the\nseveral Tirthas by the Brahmi _n_ s and fill the jar, repeating the Gayatri\nMantra. Put within this jar the twigs,\n\n\n\np. 1133\n\n\n\nthen of Cardamom tree, sandal tree, karpura tree, jati, aparajita. Saha Devi,\nPa _t_ ala, Mallika flower, Bel leaves, rice, barley, Til, mustard, as\xc2\x92vattha,\nand udumbara trees and throw them within the jar. (The K _s_ ira trees are\nAs\xc2\x92vaththa, Udumbara, Plak _s_ a, and Nyagrodha.) Doing all these, prepare one\nKus\xc2\x92a Kurcha made of twenty seven Kus\xc2\x92a grass in the form of a braid of hair,\nround one end of a straight rod and tied in a knot and place it there. Then\ntake your bath and repeat the Gayatri mantra over it one thousand times with\nyour whole mind fully concentrated. Then the Veda knowing Brahma _n_ as would\nrecite the Saura mantra and sprinkle the man attacked by the demon with water\nand make him drink also the water saturated with the mantra and bathe him also\nwith that. Then that person will be dispossessed of the devil and be happy.\nEven when the man (possessed by a devil), is going to die, he gets his life\nagain if he be made to drink this water saturated with this mantra and have\nhis bath with that. So a wise King must do this, with a desire to have a long\nlife; and after he is sprinkled with this mantra-charged water he is to give\none hundred cows to the Brahma _n_ as as the Dak _s_ i _n_ a.\n\n\n\n21-44. The Dak _s_ i _n_ a is to be given according to one\xc2\x92s might; and\nspecially what gives satisfaction to the Brahma _n_ as. If one be terrified by\na Devil or so or by the mischievous magic spells of others, one is to sit on\nSaturday under an As\xc2\x92vattha tree and repeat one hundred Gayatris. For the cure\nof all diseases, if one has to perform the Mrityunjaya Homa, one will have to\ndo Homa with the Gulancha creeper, soaked in milk and deducting the knots\nthereof. For the pacification of fever, mango leaves soaked with milk ought to\nbe used in the Homa ceremony. The wasting diseases are cured if Homa be\nperformed with the leaves of the Vacha soaked in milk; phthisis or consumption\nis cured if Homa be performed with curd, milk and ghee. Again, if offerings be\ngiven to the Solar Deity and if Payasannam be given to him and if this be\ngiven to the consumptive patient, his disease will be cured. Again, on the\nAmavasya tithi (new moon day) if Homa be performed with Soma creeper\n(excluding the knot joints) soaked in milk, then consumption will be cured. If\nHoma be made with the flowers of the S\xc2\x92amkhya tree, then leprosy is cured; if\nthe Homa be done with the seed of Apamarga, the Mrigis or the hysteric and\nepileptic fits are cured. So if Homa be performed with the fuel of K _s_ ira\ntrees, lunacy is cured; if, with the fuel of udumbara, meha (spermatorrhea) is\ncured; if with sugarcane juice, gonorrhea is cured; if with curd, milk and\nghee or with the ghee of Kapila cow, the homa be performed, the Masurika\ndisease or smallpox will be cured, and if Homa be performed with the fuels of\nUdumbara, Va _t_ a, and As\xc2\x92vatha be performed, then the diseases of cows,\nelephants\n\n\n\np. 1134\n\n\n\nand horses are cured. If the trouble be caused by many ants and ant-hills\n(Madhu Valmika) then perform the Homa ceremony with the fuel of Sami tree one\nhundred times and with the food prepared of ghee one hundred times and offer\nsacrifices with the rest of the food; then the above troubles will cease. If\nthere be a earth quake or if there be seen flashes of lightnings, then homa is\nto be performed with the fuel of Vana Vetasa and the whole kingdom will be\nhappy. If you surcharge any piece of iron with Gayatri mantra repeated hundred\ntimes and if you throw it in any direction then no fear will arise from that\nquarter out of fire, air, or any other enemy. If one be imprisoned, and if he\nrepeats the Gayatri mentally, he will be liberated from the prison. If you\ntouch the man possessed by a devil, disease or mortification and sorrow with\nthe Kus\xc2\x92a grass and repeat the Gayatri mantra, and thus charge him with Divine\nelectricity, that man will be liberated from the fear caused thereby. If you\nmake the man possessed by devils, etc., drink the water charged with the\nGayatri mantra or if you cast on his body the ashes charged with hundred\nGayatris or tie those ashes on his head repeating the Gayatri mantra, he will\nbe instantly freed of all diseases and will live for one hundred years in\nhappiness. In case a man is unable to do fully all these himself, he can get\nall these done by other Brahma _n_ as and pay Dak _s_ i _n_ a (fees) to them\nduly for the same.\n\n\n\nO Narada! Now I will tell you how nourishment and wealth are attained. Wealth\nis attained if the Homa be performed with red lotus or fresh Jati flower or\nwith the S\xc2\x92ali rice or with the fuel of Bel tress, leaves, flowers, fruits or\nroots or with any portions thereof. If for one week the oblations be offered\nwith fuel of Bel tree mixed with Payasa or with ghee one hundred times, then\nLak _s_ mi Devi will surely be attained. If the Homa be performed with Laja\n(fried rice) mixed with curd, milk, and ghee, the daughter will be obtained.\nIf for one week, the Homa be performed with red lotus, then gold is obtained.\nIf the Tarpa _n_ am (peace offering) be offered to the Sun, then the\ntreasures, gold hidden under the water, are obtained. If the Homa be performed\nwith food (Anna) then Anna is obtained; if Homa be performed with rice, then\nrice is obtained.\n\n\n\n45-51. If Homa be performed with calfdung, dried and powdered, then animals\nare obtained. If Homa be performed with Priyangu, Payasa or ghee then the\nprogeny is obtained. If the oblations of Payasanna be offered to the Solar\nDeity and if the Prasadam (remnant) be given to one\xc2\x92s wife under menstruation\nto eat, then\n\n\n\np. 1135\n\n\n\nexcellent sons will be obtained. If the Homa be performed with the fuel of wet\npointed K _s_ ira trees, then longevity is attained. If Homa be performed with\nthe fuel of the Palas\xc2\x92a tree, pointed and wet and mixed with curd, milk, and\nghee for one hundred times consecutively, then longevity and gold are\nattained. If the Homa be performed with Durba grass, milk, honey or ghee, one\nhundred times, then longevity and golden lotus are obtained. If for one week\nthe Homa ceremony be performed with the fuel of S\xc2\x92ami tree mixed with food,\nmilk or ghee one hundred times of each or if for one week the Homa he\nperformed with the fuel of Nyagrodha tree and afterwards one hundred Homas be\nmade with Payasanna, the fear of unnatural death is removed.\n\n\n\n52-60. That man can conquer death who can remain for one week living on milk\nonly and who performs during that time hundreds, and hundreds of Homas and\nrepeats the Gayatri, controlling his speech. If anybody can fast three nights\nand control his speech and repeat Gayatri he gets himself freed from the hands\nof Death; or totally immersed in water if he repeats Gayatri, he will be saved\nfrom the impending danger of death. If anybody repeats the Gayatri mantra for\none month, taking his seat under a Bel tree or performs Homa with Bel fruit,\nroot or leaves, he gets kingdoms. (Know all the Mantrams are electric in their\neffects). Similarly if anybody performs Homa with one hundred lotuses, he gets\na foeless kingdom. So one becomes the lord of a village if one performs Homa\nwith Yavagu (barley gruel) and Salidhanya. If the Homa be performed with the\nfuel of Asvaththa tree, victory in battle is ensured and if the Homa be\nperformed with the fuel of \xc3\x82kanda tree, then victory everywhere is ensured. If\none hundred Homas be performed extending a week with Vetasa tree\xc2\x92s leaves or\nfruits, dipped in milk and mixed with Payasa, the rainfall is ensured.\nSimilarly if anybody repeats Gayatri for one week with his body upto navel\nimmersed in water, the rainfall is ensured; on the contrary if the Homa be\nperformed with ashes in water, then the cessation of heavy rainfall is\nensured. The Homa with the fuel of Palasa gives Brahmateja; Homa with the\nflowers of Palasa gives everything desired. Homa with milk or drinking\nBrahmarasa, charged with mantra, increases the intellect; and the Homa with\nghee gives Buddhi (medha) (intelligence).\n\n\n\n61-69. Homa with flowers gives good smell; Homa with thread gives cloth; Homa\nwith salt and honey mixed or Bel flowers gives one power to control anything\nand everything that is desired. If anybody bathes everyday immersed completely\nwithin water and sprinkles water on his body, he becomes cured of diseases and\n\n\n\np. 1136\n\n\n\nhe becomes very healthy. If any Brahma _n_ a does these things for others, he\nbecomes also no doubt healthy. If anybody wants to increase his life period he\nshould practise good deeds and repeat Gayatri thousand times daily for one\nmonth. Thus his longevity will be increased. Two months\xc2\x92 such practice gives\nlong life and perpetual health; three month\xc2\x92s such practice will give life,\nhealth, and wealth, four months such practice gives longevity, wealth, fame,\nwomen, sons, etc., five months such practice gives longevity, health, wealth,\nwife, sons and learning. So one should repeat this as many months in\nproportion to the number of his desires and he would get them. Again any\nBrahma _n_ a who stands on one leg without holding any other thing and raises\nboth his hands and daily repeats three hundred Gayatris for one month, gets\nall his desires fulfilled. And if he repeats one thousand one hundred\nGayatris, there is nothing in this world that is not met and attained with\nsuccess. Controlling the Pra _n_ a (inhaling) and Apana (exhaling) Vayu\n(breath), he who repeats daily three hundred Gayatris to the Devi, his highest\ndesires are satisfied.\n\n\n\n70-77. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra Ri _s_ i says :-- Standing on one leg, with both hands\nraised and controlling Vayu he who repeats daily one hundred Gayatris for one\nmonth, gets all his desires fulfilled. Similarly with three hundred or\nthousand repeatings, all things are attained. Submerged under water, if one\nrepeats Gayatris as many times as mentioned above, he gets everything. If, for\none year, with hands uplifted and without holding anything, anyone stands on\none leg, controls one\xc2\x92s breath and repeats Gayatri mantra three hundred times\nor thousand times, eating Havisyannam only in the night time, he becomes a Ri\n_s_ i (Seer). This thing repeated two years gives infallible speech; three\nyears gives knowledge of the present, past and future; four years will enable\none to see face to face the Solar God; five years will give the eight Siddhis,\nlightness, etc., six years will enable one to assume forms as he desires;\nseven years gives immortality; nine years gives Manuhood; ten years gives\nIndrahood; eleven years gives Brahma-hood; and twelve years gives the state of\nParama Brahma.\n\n\n\n78-90. O Narada! By these practices of Tapasyas you and other Ri _s_ is have\nbeen able to conquer the three Lokas (regions). Some ate only vegetables; some\nfruits; some, roots; some simply water; some, ghee; some, Somarasa; whereas\nsome others ate only charu and did tapasya. Some Ri _s_ is practised this\ngreat Tapasya by eating very little for a fortnight only. Some ate food, only\nwhat they got by begging during the day; and some ate only Havi _s_ yanna. O\nNarada! Now hear the rules for the purification and expiation of sins. For the\nexpiation of the sin incurred in stealing gold, one is to repeat three\nthousand Gayatris (daily) for one\n\n\n\np. 1137\n\n\n\nmonth; then the sin will be destroyed. By this act also the sins incurred by\ndrinking or by going to one\xc2\x92s Guru\xc2\x92s wife are destroyed. Vis\xc2\x92vamitra Ri _s_ i\nsays :-- The sin incurred by killing a Brahma _n_ a (Brahmahatya) is destroyed\nif one erects a shed in a forest and, living there, repeats three thousand\nGayatris daily for one month. Those Brahma _n_ as that have committed the\nGreat Sins (i.e., Mahapatakas), become free, if they repeat one thousand\nGayatris daily, submerged under water, for twelve successive days. By\ncontrolling speech and by practising Pra _n_ ayama, if one repeats three\nthousand Gayatris daily for one month, one will be free from the Mahapatakas.\nIf one practises one thousand Pra _n_ ayamas repeating the Gayatri, one\nbecomes freed also of Brahmahatya. If one draws upwards the Pra _n_ a and\nApana Vayus six times, repeating the Gayatri with collected mind, this\ndestroys all the sins and it is called all-sin destroying Pra _n_ ayama. If\none practises this Pra _n_ ayama one thousand times for one month, the lord of\nthe earth becomes freed of all sins. If any Brahma _n_ a incurs the sin of\nkilling a cow, for twelve days he is to repeat three thousand Gayatris daily\nfor expiation. Similarly the repetition of ten thousand Gayatris removes the\nsin of going to those not fit to be gone into, eating the uneatables, stealing\nand killing and this act brings in peace. All sins are destroyed by performing\none hundred Pra _n_ ayamas with Gayatri. Again if there be a mixture of\nvarious sins, one will have to live in the forest for one month and repeat one\nthousand Gayatris or practise fasting and repeat three thousand Gayatris; thus\nall sins will be destroyed.\n\n\n\n91-100. To repeat Gayatri twenty-four thousand times is equal to performing\nthe Krichchhra vrata and to repeat sixty four thousand Gayatris duly is equal\nto performing the Chandrayana. If anybody repeats, in the morning and evening\nSandhya times, the merit giving Gayatri one hundred times, with Pra _n_ ayama,\nall his sins are destroyed. So, submerged under water, if one repeats the\nGayatri Devi, meditating Her in the Sun, one hundred times daily, one\xc2\x92s all\nthe sins are fully destroyed. O Narada! Thus I have described to you all about\naverting or destroying the evils and the purification of various sins. All\nthis is secret. Keep it carefully concealed. Never divulge this. Whoever\ndivulges this will bring his own ruin. I have spoken to you, in brief, all\nabout Sadachara (right way of living). If anybody practises this duly,\naccording to rules, S\xc2\x92ri Mahamaya Durga Devi becomes pleased with him. If\nanybody wants to have both enjoyment and liberation, he is to practise all\nthese daily, as well as the occasional, and Kamya (desired) duties duly\naccording to rules. It is stated in all the S\xc2\x92astras, that this \xc3\x82chara (right\nway of living) is the foremost and the chief Dharma, the Deity of which is\n\n\n\np. 1138\n\n\n\nthe Supreme Mother Herself. O Narada! That man who practises duly this \xc3\x82chara\nis, in this world, holy, happy and blessed. This I speak to you truly. If\nanybody desires to get the Devi Bhagavati\xc2\x92s Grace, he should first of all set\nhimself at once to practise this Sadachara. He who hears this gets wealth and\ngreat happiness. There is no doubt in this. Now speak what more you want to\nhear.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty fourth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on Sadachara in the\nMahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa. The Eleventh Book Completed.\n\n\n\n[Here ends the Eleventh Book.]\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 1](bk12ch01.htm)\n\n'
