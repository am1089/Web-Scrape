If death were not\npresent with us from the first, how should it at last visit us. (Our ultimate\ngood or bad fate is but a continuation of our present lot).\n\n1201\n\nThis frail body suffers numberless changes in many ways. Do we nourish and\nfoster it? At last it is given to the funeral flames or to the foxes of the\nwilderness.\n\n1202\n\nIf a soldier skilled in war serves a base master he will disobey and turn\nagain from seeking his favour. He will roam the towns and hamlets like a\nmonkey.\n\n1203\n\nSand, coals, stones, grass, skin, dirt, sticks, where is the sinner who does\nnot [bless](errata.htm#207) his teeth with some of these things.\n\n1204\n\nWill not those who are ignorant of swimming fall into a deep well? How should\nthose who understand swimming fall into the pit, alas, so as to be reduced to\npowder.\n\np. 287\n\n1205\n\nIf numerous vessels be placed in one house they are all in various shapes. If\nthis diversity be removed, all will become space.\n\n1206\n\nWhy O ye men do ye always think on the body? Cannot ye perceive that the body\nis perishable? Like to a bandicote caught and dying in a trap.\n\n1207\n\nIf thou consider the deity far removed from thee, he shall be far from thee.\nIf thou consider the body as his dwelling he shall dwell therein and if thou\nhold life to be his vehicle, such men shall remain stable as gods.\n\n1208\n\nClasses and customs vary; but birth is one. Viands differ but hunger is one.\n\n1209\n\nThe Sun, Moon, Tusda, Woden (Bhouma), Thor (lit. the teacher, Brihaspati),\nFrida (sucra), and Saturn--These are signs only but each day is the same.\n\np. 288\n\n1210\n\nWhat is Borax--a substance that is luminous coalesces with metals, uniting\nthem in love. The life is united to the body in a similar manner.\n\n1211\n\nHe proceeded from woman and longs for woman. Why all this love of woman and\naffection for her. He who gives up woman shall gain wisdom.\n\n1212\n\nAll fear belongs to the animal body; if fear depart the whole essence shall\nbecome the divine spirit. All destruction belongs to the body and all victory\nto the soul.\n\n1213\n\nWhatever difficulties a man meets within this world, it is not a place that\ncan be instrumental to the attainment of the next world. Then they are not\nworthy however closely you view them.\n\n1214\n\np. 289\n\nHow many are they that live on earth, in heaven, and between them; has any one\nthe power to count them. Those who live are indeed those who die.\n\n1215\n\nIf God be ours (if the Deity has been attained by us) in even the destruction,\nwe shall rejoice in glorious majesty. He that knows not God shall remain a\ncaptive.\n\n'
