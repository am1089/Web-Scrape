The Imperishable (is Brahman), on account of its supporting that which is\nthe end of ether.\n\nThe Va _g_ asaneyins, in the chapter recording the questions asked by Gargi,\nread as follows: 'He said, O Gargi, the Brahma _n_ as call that the\nImperishable. It is neither coarse nor fine, neither short nor long, it is not\nred, not fluid, it is without a shadow,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 8). A doubt\nhere arises whether that Imperishable be the Pradhana, or the individual soul,\nor the highest Self.--The Pradhana, it may be maintained in the first place.\nFor we see that in passages such as 'higher than that which is higher than the\nImperishable' the term 'Imperishable' actually denotes the Pradhana; and\nmoreover the qualities enumerated, viz. not being either coarse or fine, &c.,\nare characteristic of the Pradhana.--But, an objection is raised, in texts\nsuch as 'That knowledge by which the Imperishable is apprehended' (Mu. Up. I,\n1, 5), the word 'Imperishable' is seen to denote the highest Brahman!--In\ncases, we reply, where the meaning of a word may be determined on the basis\neither of some\n\np. 309\n\nother means of proof or of Scripture, the former meaning presents itself to\nthe mind first, and hence there is no reason why such meaning should not be\naccepted.--But how do you know that the ether of the text is not ether in the\nordinary sense?--From the description, we reply, given of it in the text,\n'That above the heavens,' &c. There it is said that all created things past,\npresent and future rest on ether as their basis; ether cannot therefore be\ntaken as that elementary substance which itself is comprised in the sphere of\nthings created. We therefore must understand by 'ether' matter in its subtle\nstate, i.e. the Pradhana; and the Imperishable which thereupon is declared to\nbe the support of that Pradhana, hence cannot itself be the Pradhana.--Nor is\nthere any force in the argument that a sense established by some other means\nof proof presents itself to the mind more immediately than a sense established\nby Scripture; for as the word 'akshara' (i.e. the non-perishable) intimates\nits sense directly through the meaning of its constituent elements other means\nof proof need not be regarded at all.\n\nMoreover Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya had said previously that the ether is the cause and\nabode of all things past, present and future, and when Gargi thereupon asks\nhim in what that ether 'is woven,' i.e. what is the causal substance and abode\nof ether, he replies 'the Imperishable.' Now this also proves that by the\n'Imperishable' we have to understand the Pradhana which from other sources is\nknown to be the causal substance, and hence the abode, of all effected things\nwhatsoever.\n\nThis prima facie view is set aside by the Sutra. The 'Imperishable' is the\nhighest Brahman, because the text declares it to support that which is the\nend, i. e. that which lies beyond ether, viz. unevolved matter (avyak _ri_\ntam). The ether referred to in Gargi's question is not ether in the ordinary\nsense, but what lies beyond ether, viz. unevolved matter, and hence the\n'Imperishable' which is said to be the support of that 'unevolved' cannot\nitself be the 'unevolved,' i.e. cannot be the Pradhana. Let us, then, the\nPurvapakshin resumes, understand by the 'Imperishable,'\n\np. 310\n\nthe individual soul; for this may be viewed as the support of the entire\naggregate of non-sentient matter, inclusive of the elements in their subtle\ncondition; and the qualities of non-coarseness, &c., are characteristic of\nthat soul also. Moreover there are several texts in which the term\n'Imperishable' is actually seen to denote the individual soul; so e.g. 'the\nnon-evolved' is merged in the 'Imperishable'; 'That of which the non-evolved\nis the body; that of which the Imperishable is the body'; 'All the creatures\nare the Perishable, the non-changing Self is called the Imperishable' (Bha.\nG\xc3\x8e. XV, 16).\n\nTo this alternative prima facie view the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10. And this supporting springs from command...](sbe48109.htm)\n\n"
