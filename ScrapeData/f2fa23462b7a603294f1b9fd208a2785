Sri\nRamakrishna was seated on the southern veranda of His room, and He was\nsmiling. After a short conversation He asked: "Do you prefer to meditate on\nGod with form or without form?" The disciple hesitated and answered: "I prefer\nto meditate upon God as the formless Being rather than as a Being with form."\nThe Bhagavan replied: "That is good. There is no harm in looking at Him from\nthis or the other point of view. Yes, to think of Him as the formless Being is\nquite right. But do not go away with the idea that that alone is true and that\nall else is false. Meditating\n\np. 63\n\nupon Him as a Being with form is equally right. You, however, must hold on to\nyour particular conception of God until you have realized and seen God."\n\nImage Worship.The disciple asked: "Bhagavan, one may believe that God is with\nform, but surely He is not in the earthen images that are worshipped?" Sri\nRamakrishna replied: "My dear sir, why do you say earthen images? The image of\nthe Divine Being is made of the spirit." The disciple could not understand the\nmeaning of this, but answered: "Yet should it not be one\'s duty to make clear\nto those who worship images that God is not the same as the images and that at\nthe time of worship they should think of God Himself and not of the image made\nof clay?" The Bhagavan said: "The Lord of the universe teaches mankind. He who\nhas made the sun and moon, men and brutes; He who has created things for them\nto live upon, parents to tend and rear them; He who has done so many things\nwill surely do something to bring them to the light. The Lord dwells in the\ntemple of the human body. He knows our innermost thoughts. If there is\nanything wrong in image worship, does He not know that all worship is\n\np. 64\n\nmeant for Him? He will be pleased to accept it knowing that it is for Him. Why\nshould you worry yourself about things which are beyond your reach? Try to\nrealize God and love Him. This is your first duty.\n\n"You speak of images made of clay. Well, there often comes a necessity for\nworshipping such images and symbols. In Vedanta it is said, the absolute\nExistence-Intelligence-Bliss pervades the universe and manifests itself\nthrough all forms. What harm is done by worshipping the Absolute through\nimages and symbols? We see little girls with their dolls. How long do they\nplay with them? So long as they are not married. After marriage they put away\nthose dolls. Similarly, one needs images and symbols so long as God is not\nrealized in His true form. It is God Himself who has provided these various\nforms of worship. The Master of the universe has done all this to suit\ndifferent men in different stages of spiritual growth and knowledge. The\nmother so arranges the food for her children that each one gets what is best\nfor him. Suppose a mother has five children with one fish to cook for all. She\nwill make different dishes of it that she may give to each just what suits\nhim,--the rich\n\np. 65\n\n_pol ao_ for one, soup for another, fried fish for a third, fish with sour\ntamarind for a fourth. and so on, exactly according to the power of digestion\nof each. Do you now understand?"\n\nThe disciple replied: "Yes, Bhagavan, now I do. But, Revered Sir, how can one\nfix one\'s mind on God?"\n\nHow to fix one\'s mind on God.Sri Ramakrishna: To that end one must always sing\nforth the Holy Name of God and talk without ceasing of His glory and\nattributes. Then one must seek the company of holy men. One must from time to\ntime visit the Lord\'s devotees or those who have given up attachment to the\nthings of the world for the sake of the Lord. It is, however, difficult to fix\none\'s mind upon God in the midst of worldly cares and anxieties; hence the\nnecessity of going into solitude now and again with a view to meditating on\nHim. Solitude necessary.In the first stage of one\'s spiritual life one cannot\ndo without solitude. When plants are young, they stand in need of fences\naround them for their protection; otherwise goats and cattle will destroy\nthem. The depth of the heart, the retired corner, and the forest are the three\nplaces for meditation.\n\np. 66\n\n[paragraph continues] One should also practise discrimination. One should\ndiscriminate between the Real and the unreal, between matter and spirit. It is\nthus that one will shake off one\'s love for the things of the world and\nattachment to sensual pleasures, wealth, fame, power.\n\nAvadhuta and a kite.Turning to Bijoy, who had come in, the Bhagavan continued:\nShivanath, the leader of the Brahmo Samaj, has great cares, he has to edit a\nnewspaper and do various other works In attending to worldly affairs, one\nnaturally loses peace of mind and is overwhelmed with worries and anxieties.\nIt is said in the Bhagavat that Avadhuta * made twenty-four Gurus. The kite\nwas one of them. In a certain place some fishermen were catching fish, a kite\nswooped down and snatched a fish. Seeing the kite with the fish in its claw,\nhundreds of crows flew after him and began to caw, making a great noise. In\nwhatever direction the kite flew, the crows followed. When he flew to the\n\np. 67\n\nsouth, they pursued him; when he flew to the north, they were after him, and\nhe found no peace in any direction. At last the kite dropped the fish. Then\nthe crows flew after the fish and the kite rested calmly on the branch of a\nhigh tree. He thought within himself: "That fish was the cause of all this\ntrouble. Now that I no longer have it, I am happy and in perfect peace." The\nAvadhuta learned from this kite that as long as a man is attached to worldly\nobjects, so long he has toil, cares, anxiety, unrest and unhappiness. When\nattachment is gone, all works end, and then comes peace. But work without\nattachment is good; it does not bring unrest.\n\nAvadhuta and a bee.It is very difficult, however, to work and remain\nunattached. A few only can accomplish it. Those who have attained to God-\nconsciousness, like the sage Narada, work for the good of humanity. Avadhuta\nmade another Guru--a bee. What trouble a bee takes to collect honey! But it is\nnot for its own use; some one else comes and takes the honey from the comb.\nThe Avadhuta learned from the bee that it is not wise to collect anything.\nTruly spiritual men should depend absolutely upon God and should not\n\np. 68\n\ndesire to possess anything. But this is not possible for householders. They\nwill have to support their families and therefore they should gather and\npossess. A fowl does not gather into barns, but when it has a number of young\nones, then it brings food for them in its bill.\n\nPractice of non-attachment.Perform all your duties with your mind always fixed\non God. As for your parents, wife and children, serve them as your own, but\nalways remember they do not belong to you, that they are the children of God.\nYou are also a child of God and your own people are those who love God. The\ntortoise moves about in the water in quest of food; where do you think her\nmind is? On the water\'s edge where her eggs are laid. In the same manner you\nmay go about in the world, but take good care that your mind always rests upon\nthe hallowed feet of the Lord.\n\nSuppose you have not acquired true love for the Lord? If in this state you\nenter the world, then you will surely get entangled. Misfortune, grief,\nmisery, sorrow, suffering and the various diseases of the body will disturb\nthe balance of your mind; and the more you will throw yourself into the\naffairs of the world and trouble\n\np. 69\n\nyourself about worldly matters, the more your attachment to the world will be\nincreased. Rub your hand with oil if you desire to break open the jackfruit,\nelse the milky exudation of the fruit will stick to your hands. First rub your\nsoul with the oil of love and devotion to the Lord, then you may come in\ncontact with the affairs of the world. Need of solitude.But to this end\nsolitude is the one thing needful. If you want butter, you must curdle the\nmilk and set it in a place where no one can disturb it; otherwise the curd\nwill not stand. Then churn it and the butter will rise. Similarly the neophyte\nshould sit in solitude and not be disturbed by worldly-minded people; then\nthrough the churning of the settled mind by the practice of meditation the\nbutter of Divine Love will be acquired. If you give your mind to God in\nsolitude, you will obtain the spirit of true renunciation and absolute\ndevotion. If you give the same mind to the world, it will grow worldly and\nthink of woman and gold.\n\nThe world may be likened to water, and the mind to milk. Pure milk once mixed\nwith water cannot be separated from it; but if it is first turned into butter\nand then placed in water,\n\np. 70\n\nit can remain separate. Let the milk of your mind be turned into the butter of\nDivine Love by means of religious practices in solitude. The mind then will\nnever get mixed with the water of worldliness, but will rise above and remain\nunattached to the world. Having attained true knowledge and devotion the mind\nwill stand apart from the world.\n\nLust and gold unreal.Along with this, practise discrimination. "Lust and gold"\nare unreal; God is the one Reality. What uses has money? It can give one food,\nclothes, house, the luxuries and comforts of life, but it cannot bring\nspiritual perfection or God-vision. Therefore the acquisition of wealth should\nnot be the highest end and aim of life. In this manner you should\ndiscriminate. Similarly by discrimination you will overcome your attachment to\npersonal beauty. Think what the body of a beautiful woman is made of. Like all\nbodies it is of flesh and blood, skin and bones, fat and marrow, etc. The\nwonder is that man loses sight of God and gives his mind purely to such\ntransitory objects of sense.\n\nThe disciple asked: "Bhagavan, is it possible to see God?"\n\nSri Ramakrishna: Certainly. The following\n\np. 71\n\nMeans of God-vision.are some of the means of seeing God: Going from time to\ntime into solitude; singing forth His name and His attributes; discrimination.\n\nThe disciple: Bhagavan, what state of mind leads to God-vision?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: Cry to God with a yearning heart and then you will see Him.\nPeople will shed a jugful of tears for the sake of their wife or children;\nthey will be carried away by a stream of their own tears for the sake of\nmoney; but who sheds a tear for God? Cry for Him, not for show, but with a\nlonging and yearning heart. The rosy light of the dawn comes before the rising\nsun; likewise a longing and yearning heart is the sign of God-vision that\ncomes after.\n\nExtreme longing is the surest way to God-vision. Through extreme longing the\nmind remains fixed on the Supreme Being. One should have faith like that of an\ninnocent child and such longing as a child has when it wants to see its\nmother. There was a boy named Jatila. He used to go to school alone through\nthe woods. Often he felt lonely and afraid. He told his mother about it and\nshe said to him: "Why art thou fearful, my child? Thou\n\np. 72\n\nmust call Krishna whenever thou art frightened." "Who is Krishna, mother?" the\nboy asked. The mother answered: "Krishna is thy brother." Power of faith and\ntrue longing.After that when Jatila was passing true through the woods alone\nand felt frightened, he called aloud, "Brother Krishna!" When no one came, he\ncried again: "O Brother Krishna, where art thou? Come to me and protect me; I\nam frightened." Hearing the call of this faithful child, Krishna could no\nlonger remain away. He appeared in the form of a young boy and said: "Here am\nI, thy brother! Why art thou frightened? Come with me, I will take thee to\nschool." Then having escorted him to school, Lord Krishna said to him: "I will\ncome to thee whenever thou callest me; do not be afraid." Such is the power of\ntrue faith and true longing.\n\nYou can see God if your love for Him he as strong as the strength of these\nthree attachments How to love put together: namely, the attachment God. of a\nmiser to his wealth, that of a mother to her new-born child, and that of a\nchaste wife to her husband.\n\nTo see God one must love Him with the whole heart and soul. One must make\none\'s prayers\n\np. 73\n\nreach the Divine Mother. Absolute self-resignation to the will of the Divine\nMother is the surest way to God-vision. As the kitten resigns itself to the\nwill of its mother, so a devotee shall resign himself to the will of the\nDivine Mother. The kitten knows nothing more than to cry "Mew, mew," and the\nmother-cat may keep her young one on the bare floor of the kitchen or on the\ndowny bed of the householder. The kitten is always contented. Similarly the\ntrue devotee should always cry unto the Divine Mother and be contented with\nwhatever She wishes to do with him.\n\nFetters of the soul.God-consciousness does not come so long as there are three\nthings in the heart,--shame, hatred and fear. These three and caste pride are\nthe fetters of the soul. When these fetters are broken, freedom is attained.\nBound by fetters is Jiva (the ego), free from fetters is Shiva (God).\n\nEvery man has certain debts to pay,--a debt to the Divine Spirit, a debt to\nthe sages, debt to mother, to father, to the wife. No man can renounce\neverything without paying off these debts. But if his soul be intoxicated with\nDivine Love and become mad after God, then he is free from all duties and\ndebts. Then who\n\np. 74\n\nis his father, who is his mother and who is his wife? Madness of Divine\nLove.He behaves like a madman who is free from all bondage and who has no duty\nto perform. Do you know what that madness of Divine Love is? In that state one\nforgets the world and becomes unconscious of one\'s own body which is so dear\nto one. Chaitanya Deva possessed this madness of ecstasy. He had neither\nhunger, nor thirst, nor sleep, nor consciousness of his physical form. The\nmeaning of the word Chaitanya is "indivisible and absolute intelligence."\nVaishnava Charan used to say that Chaitanya Deva, the Incarnation of Divine\nLove, was like a bubble on the ocean of that Absolute Intelligence.\n\nDivine Love and ecstasy.Divine Love is the rarest thing in the world. He who\ncan love God as a devoted wife loves her husband, attains to Divine Love. Pure\nlove is difficult to acquire. In pure love the whole heart and soul must be\nabsorbed in God. Then will come ecstasy. In ecstasy a man remains dumb with\nwonder. Outward breathing stops entirely, but inward breathing continues: as\nwhen aiming a gun, a man remains speechless and without breathing. In Divine\nLove one entirely forgets the external world with all its charms and\nattractions;\n\np. 75\n\neven one\'s own body, which is so dear to one, is easily forgotten. In ecstasy,\nwhen the breathing stops, the whole mind remains absolutely fixed upon the\nSupreme. All nerve currents run upward with tremendous force and the result is\nSamadhi or God-consciousness. Those who are mere scholars (Pandits) and have\nnot attained Divine Love, confound the minds of others.\n\nPride.Some people are proud of their wealth, their fame and social position,\nbut these things are transitory. None can take them away after death. It is\nnot good to be proud of wealth. You may say, "I am wealthy," but then there\nare millionaires, multimillionaires, and so on. In the evening fireflies think\nthat they are lighting the world; but when the stars begin to shine, their\npride is subdued. The stars in turn think that they are lighting the world,\nbut when the moon shines, the stars are put to shame. The moon, too, believes\nthat her light illumines everything; but lo! the dawn appears and the rising\nsun effaces the light of the moon. If wealthy people thought of these things,\nthey would no longer be proud of their wealth.\n\nA householder! Revered Sir, we are householders;\n\np. 76\n\nplease give us some further instructions.\n\nSri Ramakrishna: First know God, then perform the duties of a householder.\n\nHouseholder: Revered Sir, is this world unreal?\n\nThe world unreal.Sri Ramakrishna: So long as a man does not realize God, so\nlong it is real; because at that time he makes mistakes and through self-\ndelusion says: "Me and mine." Being fettered by this self-delusion, he drowns\nin the sea of lust and worldliness, and becomes so blinded by ignorance that\nhe cannot see the way out. You yourself can notice how transitory the world\nis. Look at this house; how many people have come and gone; how many people\nhave been born and have died in it! Now it exists, now it does not; it is\nephemeral. Those whom you call your own will vanish when your eyes are closed.\nIf you have no one in the household, still you are bound and cannot go\nanywhere because of some distant relative. The way is open, but the fish\ncannot escape from the net. The silkworm makes its own cocoon, but does not\nknow how to get out and consequently dies in it.\n\nA householder should take care of his children,\n\np. 77\n\nHow a householder should live in the world.but at the same time he should\nthink of them as Baby Krishna, or as children of God. Serve your father as\nGod, and your mother as Divine Mother. After realizing God, if a man lives\nwith his wife, he has no physical relation with her. Both live like Bhaktas or\ntrue devotees. They talk of spiritual subjects and spend their time in\nthinking of God and in caring for His Bhaktas. They serve God who dwells in\nall beings.\n\nHouseholder: But, Revered Sir, we do not find any such husbands and wives.\n\nRamakrishna: Yes, there are some, but they are very rare. Worldly people do\nnot easily recognize them. But in order to live like this both must he\nspiritual. If both enjoy Divine Love, then such a life is possible; otherwise\nthere will be no harmony, but discord and trouble between husband and wife.\nPerhaps the wife will complain, saying: "Why did I marry this man! What\npleasure does he give me? He simply sits quietly and thinks of God. He is\nlosing his mind."\n\nA devotee: These are some of the obstacles; but there may be others. The\nchildren may be disobedient or may be diseased. Then, Revered Sir, what is to\nbe done?\n\np. 78\n\nRamakrishna: It is very difficult for a householder to practise devotion.\nThere are many obstacles. You all know them very well,--disease, sorrow,\npoverty, disharmony with the wife, disobedience and evil tendencies in the\nchildren; but there is a way out of it. One should occasionally live in\nsolitude and pray and struggle hard to attain to God.\n\nA householder: Revered Sir, is it necessary to leave one\'s home?\n\nRamakrishna: Not for good; but occasionally when you find opportunity, for a\nday or two, leaving behind responsibility, care and anxiety. But during this\ntime you should not mix with worldly people or think of worldly affairs.\nEither live alone, or in the company of some saint or holy man.\n\nHouseholder: Revered Sir, how can we know or recognize a saint?\n\nHow to recognize a saint.Ramakrishna: He is a saint whose heart, soul, and\ninner nature have turned towards God; he who has renounced woman and wealth. A\nsaint does not look at women with the eye of desire; if he comes near a woman,\nhe sees the Divine Mother in her and worships her. His thoughts are always on\nGod and his words are of Him. He sees God everywhere\n\np. 79\n\nand knows that by serving others, he serves Him. These are some of the outward\nsigns of a saint.\n\nHouseholder: Revered Sir, is it necessary to remain long in solitude?\n\nRamakrishna: Until right discrimination is acquired.\n\nHouseholder: Revered Sir, what is right discrimination?\n\nRight discrimination.Ramakrishna: God is Truth, the world is untruth; this is\ndiscrimination. Truth means that which is unchangeable and permanent, and\nuntruth is that which is changeable and transitory. He who has right\ndiscrimination knows that God alone is the Reality; all other things are\nunreal. When right discrimination comes, then rises intense desire to know\nGod. As long as one loves untruth, such as the pleasures and comforts of the\nbody, fame, honor and wealth, so long one does not desire to know God, the\nTruth. Right discrimination between Truth and untruth leads one to search\nafter God.\n\nAnother householder devotee: Bhagavan, we have heard that Thou hast attained\nto ecstasy and God-consciousness; wilt Thou please explain when and how such a\nstate comes?\n\np. 80\n\nEcstasy.Ramakrishna: Ecstasy does not come to one who has not realized God.\nWhen a fish rises from deep water, it disturbs the surface of the water, and\nthe larger the fish, the greater the disturbance. Therefore, a person in the\nstate of ecstasy sometimes laughs, sometimes weeps, sometimes sings, sometimes\ndances, but one cannot remain in that state of ecstasy for a long time.\n\nHouseholder devotee: Bhagavan, we have heard that Thou hast seen God. If this\nbe true, please make us see Him also.\n\nWork necessary for God-vision.Ramakrishna: Everything depends upon the will of\nthe Lord. What can man do? One may repeat His Holy Name, but sometimes tears\nflow and sometimes not. At the time of meditation, one day you may have\nperfect concentration and another day you will not be able to fix your mind at\nall. Work is necessary for God-vision. Once I was passing by a pool, the\nsurface of which was covered by a thick scum; I saw a poor man pushing the\nscum to one side to look at the water. This showed me that if you wish to see\nthe water, you must push aside the scum. That act of pushing is like the work\nwhich removes all the impurities of the heart, Then\n\np. 81\n\n[paragraph continues] God is visible. Concentration, meditation, repetition of\nthe Name of the Lord, charitable works, self-sacrifice, these works will\nremove the scum of ignorance which covers the water of Divinity in the pool of\nthe heart.\n\nMahima, * who had joined the group of devotees, exclaimed: Oh yes, Bhagavan,\nsuch works are absolutely necessary. Tireless labor is needed to attain great\nresults. How much we must study! Innumerable are the sciences, Scriptures and\nphilosophies.\n\nRamakrishna: How much can you study? What results can you get by mere\ndiscrimination? First try to realize God. Have faith in the words of your\nGuru, and perform some good work. If you have not found a Guru, a true\nspiritual master, earnestly pray to God. He will show you what He is like.\nWhat can you know by reading books? Before you enter a market-place, you can\nhear only a loud confused uproar; but when you go near, all confusion will\nvanish and you will distinguish what each\n\np. 82\n\none is calling. Before you reach the shore, you hear the roar of the waves;\nbut when you come near, you see vessels, sea-gulls, birds, and you can count\nthe waves. Book knowledge and realization.One cannot realize Divinity by\nreading books. There is a vast difference between book knowledge and\nrealization. After realization, all books, sciences and Scriptures seem to he\nlike worthless straw. It is necessary first to make acquaintance with the\nlandlord. Why are you so anxious to know beforehand how many houses, how many\ngardens, how many stocks and bonds he possesses? If you ask the servants, they\nwill not tell you; nor will they notice you. But if you can once become\nacquainted with the landlord, by whatever means, you will learn about his\npossessions in a moment, and the servants then will bow down to you and honor\nyou.\n\nA devotee: Bhagavan, how can one make acquaintance with the Landlord?\n\nRamakrishna: For that, I say, work is necessary. What is the use of sitting\nquietly and saying, "God exists"? If you merely sit on the shore of a lake and\nsay: "There are fish in this lake," will you catch any? Go and get the things\nnecessary for fishing, get a rod and line\n\np. 83\n\nand bait and throw some lure in the water. Then from the deep water the fish\nwill rise and come nearer, and you will be able to see and catch them. You\nwish me to show you God while you sit quietly by, without making the least\neffort. How unreasonable! You would have me set the curds, churn the butter,\nand hold it before your mouths. You ask me to catch the fish and place it in\nyour hands. How unreasonable! If a man desires to see the King in his palace,\nhe will have to go to the palace and pass through all the gates; but if after\nentering the outermost gate he exclaims, "Where is the King?" he will not find\nhim. He must go on through the seven gates, then he will see the King.\n\nMahima: Bhagavan, by what kind of work can God be attained?\n\nWork and grace.Ramakrishna: There is no difference in work. Do not think that\nthis work will lead to God and that will not. Everything depends upon His\nGrace. Whatever work you perform with sincerity and earnest longing will\nattract His Grace and help towards realization. Through His Grace the\nconditions for realization will become perfect. These conditions are\nassociation with the holy, right discrimination\n\np. 84\n\nof the Real from the unreal, and the finding of the real Guru, or true\nspiritual master. If your family depends upon you, perhaps your brother will\nassume its responsibility for you. Perhaps your wife will not hinder you in\nyour spiritual life, but will rather help you; or perhaps you will not marry\nat all and will not be attached to the world in any way. When such conditions\nbecome absolutely favorable, the realization of God becomes easy.\n\nParable of the father and his dying son.Once a man\'s son lay at the point of\ndeath and none could help him. Some one, however, said: "There is but one\nhope. If you can get the venom of a cobra mixed with a few drops of rain-water\nfallen under the constellation of _Sw ati_ in a human skull, by it your son\'s\nlife will be saved." The father looked and found that the constellation of _Sw\nati_ would be in the ascendant on the morrow; so he prayed, saying: "O Lord,\ndo Thou make possible all these conditions and spare the life of my son." With\nextreme earnestness and longing in his heart he set out on the following\nevening and searched diligently in a deserted spot for a human skull. At last\nhe found one under a tree and watched, praying. Suddenly a shower came up and\na few drops of\n\np. 85\n\nrain lodged in the upturned skull. He said to himself: "Now I have the water\nin the skull under the right constellation." Then he prayed earnestly: "Grant,\nLord, that the rest may also come." In a short time he discovered a toad not\nfar from the skull, and he prayed again. Then from the grass sprang a cobra to\nsnatch the toad, but at that moment the toad jumped over the skull and the\nvenom of the cobra fell into it. With overwhelming gratitude the anxious\nfather cried out: "Lord, by Thy Grace all impossible things are possible. Now\nI know that my son\'s life will be saved." Therefore I say, if you have true\nfaith and earnest longing, you will get everything by the Grace of the Lord.\nNon-attachment necessary.God cannot be obtained so long as the mind is not\nabsolutely free from all worldly attachment. A true sage is one who cannot\nhoard anything for himself. There is a saying: "A fowl of the air and a true\nsage do not gather stores; they do not keep anything for the morrow." As\nregards myself, I cannot keep anything even for my personal needs. I cannot\nput away any object, even a clove, for the future. At one time I thought of\ngoing to Benares, but afterwards I discovered that I had to carry clothes and\ntake money with\n\np. 86\n\nme, so it was impossible for me to go. (Turning to Mahima) But you are\nhouseholders, you can have both this and that, both the world and the\nspiritual life.\n\nMahima: Bhagavan, "this" cannot remain long.\n\nRamakrishna: When I was practising renunciation, one day I went to the Ganges\nnear the _Panchavati_ and took up a handful of earth and a handful of coins;\nthen I began to discriminate, saying that earth and gold are one and the same;\nearth is gold and gold is earth; and after realizing the sameness, I threw\nboth into the river. I prayed to my Divine Mother, saying: "O Mother, I do not\ndesire material wealth or earthly prosperity, but only that Thou dwell within\nmy heart." When the mind renounces attachment to lust and wealth, it turns\ntowards God and ultimately becomes attached to Him. Then that which was bound\nbecomes free. To be turned away from God is bondage. The mind is like the\nneedle of a scale and God is the central point of balance. When the weight of\nworldly attachment is in the heart, the scale drops to one side and the needle\nof the mind is deflected from the central point or God. The heavier the\nweight, the\n\np. 87\n\ngreater is the deflection. Why does a child cry after its birth? It thinks, as\nit were: "I was enjoying Divine Communion, but now I have lost it. Where have\nI come and where is my God, where is my God?" For you (to Mahima) the\nrenunciation should be in the mind only. You should remain in the world, but\nunattached to it.\n\nMahima: Revered Sir, can the world exist for the mind which is fixed on God?\n\nRamakrishna: Of course it will exist; otherwise where will it go? I see that\nwherever I remain, I am in the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is\neverywhere.Verily I say unto you, this world is the kingdom of God.\nRamachandra, the Divine Incarnation and the Hero of the epic Ramayana, said to\nhis father that he would renounce the world and go to a spiritual Guru in\norder to attain spiritual wisdom. The father summoned the great sage Vashishta\nto reason with his son. Vashishta saw that Rama had intense dispassion for the\nworld; he then said to him. "O Rama, first discriminate with me, then renounce\nthe world." By right discrimination Rama realized that God manifests Himself\nin the form of Jiva, or the individual soul and the world. Everything lives\nand exists\n\np. 88\n\nin and through His Being. Then Rama kept silent.\n\nSome time ago Vaishnava Charan said that perfect knowledge of God is attained\nwhen one perceives Him in all human beings. I have now come to a stage of\nrealization in which I see that God is walking in every human form and\nmanifesting Himself alike through the sage and the sinner, the virtuous and\nthe vicious. Therefore when I meet different people, I say to myself: "God in\nthe form of the saint, God in the form of the sinner, God in the form of the\nunrighteous and God in the form of the righteous." He who has attained to such\nrealization goes beyond good and evil, above virtue and vice, and realizes\nthat the Divine will is working everywhere.\n\nParable of the monk and the Zemindar.There was a Hindu monastery in a certain\nvillage. The monks of the monastery went out every day with begging bowls to\ngather food. One day, a monk, passing by, saw a Zemindar severely beating a\npoor man. The holy man, being very kind-hearted, entreated the Zemindar to\nstop beating the man. The Zemindar, blind with rage, immediately turned on the\nmonk and poured upon him the venom of his anger. He\n\np. 89\n\nbeat him until he was knocked unconscious on the ground. Another man, seeing\nhis condition, went to the monastery and told what had happened. His brother\nmonks ran to the spot where the holy man was lying. They lifted him and\nbrought him to the monastery and laid , him in a room; but the holy man still\nremained unconscious for a long time. Sorrowful and anxious, his brothers\nfanned him, bathed his face, put milk into his mouth and tried to nurse him\nback to life. Gradually they brought him back to consciousness. The holy man\nopened his eyes and looked at his fellow-brethren. One of them, desiring to\nknow whether he could recognize his friends, asked him in a loud voice:\n"Maharaj, dost thou recognize him who is feeding thee with milk?" The holy man\nanswered in a feeble voice: "Brother, he who beat me is now feeding me." And\nRamakrishna added: But one cannot realize this oneness of the Spirit unless\none has reached God-consciousness.\n\nResignation.Live in the world like a dead leaf. As a dead leaf is carried by\nthe wind into a house or on the roadside and has no choice of its own, so let\nthe wind of Divine Will blow you wherever it chooses. Now it has placed you in\nthe world, be contented.\n\np. 90\n\n[paragraph continues] Again when it will carry you to a better place, be\nequally resigned. The Lord has kept you in the world, what can you do? Resign\neverything to Him, even your own dear self; then all trouble will be over. You\nwill see then that He is doing everything; everywhere is the will of Rama *\n(God).\n\nParable of the pious weaver.In a certain village there lived a weaver. He was\nvery spiritual; everyone trusted and loved him. The weaver went to the market\nto sell his cloth. If a customer asked the price of it, he would say: "By the\nwill of Rama the thread cost one Rupee, by the will of Rama the labor cost\nfour Annas, by the will of Rama the profit is two Annas, by the will of Rama\nthe price of the cloth as it stands is one Rupee and six Annas." People had\nsuch confidence in him that they would immediately pay the price and take the\ncloth. This man was a true devotee. At night after dinner he would sit for a\nlong time and meditate on God and repeat His Holy Name. Once it was late into\nthe night; he could not sleep;\n\np. 91\n\nhe was sitting alone in the courtyard near the entrance, smoking. A gang of\nrobbers was passing that way. They wanted a carrier, and seeing this man, they\ndragged him away with them. Then they broke into a house and stole a great\nmany things, some of which they piled on the poor weaver\'s head. At this\nmoment the watchman came up, the robbers ran away and the poor weaver with his\nload was caught. He had to spend that night in confinement. Next morning he\nwas brought before the judge. The people of the village, hearing what had\nhappened, came to see the weaver. They unanimously declared: "My lord, this\nman has not stolen anything." The judge then asked the weaver to describe what\nhad occurred. The weaver said: "My lord, by the will of Rama, I was sitting in\nthe courtyard; by the will of Rama it was very late in the night; I, by the\nwill of Rama, was meditating upon God and repeating His Holy Name; when, by\nthe will of Rama, a band of robbers passed that way; by the will of Rama they\ndragged me away with them; by the will of Rama they broke into a house; by the\nwill of Rama they piled a load on my head; when, by the will of Rama, the\nwatchman came up and, by the will of Rama, I was caught.\n\np. 92\n\n[paragraph continues] Then, by the will of Rama, I was kept in prison, and\nthis morning the will of Rama has brought me before thee." The judge, seeing\nthe innocence and spirituality of the man, ordered him to be released. Coming\nout, the weaver said to his friends, "The will of Rama has released me."\nEverything depends on God\'s will.Whether you live in the world or renounce it,\neverything depends upon the will of Rama. Throwing your whole responsibility\nupon God, do your work in the world. If you cannot do this, what else can you\ndo?\n\nIf a clerk be imprisoned, when the term of his sentence is over and he comes\nout, tell me, will he pass his time in dancing for joy over his release or\nresume his work as clerk? So when the householder is liberated from the prison\nof the world, will he spend his life in rejoicing over his liberation? He may\ncontinue to perform his duties as householder, if he so desires. He who has\nattained wisdom makes no distinction between this place and that place; to him\nall positions are equal. He who has found God here has also found Him there.\nWhen the tail of a tadpole drops off, it can live both in water and on land.\nWhen the tail of ignorance drops off, man becomes free. He\n\np. 93\n\ncan then live both in God and in the world equally well.\n\nThe world like a dream.Those who follow monistic (Advaita) Vedanta, however,\nlook upon this world as unreal, like a dream. According to them Paramatman, or\nthe Over-Soul, is the witness of the three states of consciousness,--waking,\ndream and dreamless sleep. All these are ideas. The dream state is just as\nreal as the waking state. Let me tell you a story.\n\nParable of the farmer and his only child.There was a farmer who was a monist;\nhe had attained to some realization. He lived like any other farmer with his\nfamily, and he had a child. He and his wife had extreme love for this son\nbecause he was their only child. The farmer himself was a very spiritual man.\nHe was respected and loved by everyone in the village. Once he was working in\nthe field, when suddenly a man brought the news of his son\'s severe illness.\nHe went home, called physicians, took great care, but could not save the\nchild\'s life. Everybody in the household was overwhelmed with grief, but the\nfarmer looked as if nothing had happened. He consoled others by saying, "What\ncan be gained by mourning over the child?" The next day he went to the field\nas\n\np. 94\n\nusual, and after finishing his work he came home and found his wife and the\nother members of the family still weeping and wailing and plunged in deep\nsorrow. The wife reproached him, saying: "How heartless you are! you have not\nshed a single tear for your only child." The farmer then calmly replied:\n"Shall I tell you why I do not weep? Last night I had a wonderful dream. I saw\nthat I was a king, and the father of eight beautiful children, and that I was\nenjoying all the pleasures and comforts of life. Suddenly I woke up and the\ndream passed away. Now I am in great confusion,--whether I shall weep and wail\nfor my eight children or for this only one." The farmer was an Advaita Jnani,\ntherefore he realized that the waking state was as unreal as the dream state,\nand that the one permanent Reality was \xc3\x82tman. But I accept all states as true,\n--the state of Samadhi, which is the fourth state, and again, the waking,\ndream and dreamless sleep state. I accept Brahman the Absolute and Maya, Jiva\n(the individual soul) and the world. If I do not take all, a portion will be\nmissing and the weight will be less.\n\nA devotee: How could the weight be less?\n\nRamakrishna: Brahman the Absolute is with\n\np. 95\n\nThe Absolute and the phenomenal.the individual souls and the phenomenal world.\nFirst, when a person is discriminating by saying: "Not this, not this," he\nleaves the individual egos and the phenomenal world aside; then after reaching\nthe Absolute, when he returns, he realizes that the Absolute appears as the\nphenomenal world. In a wood-apple there are seeds, pulp and the shell. When I\ntake the pulp, I leave out the seeds and the shell; but when I speak of the\nweight of the wood-apple, the weight of the pulp alone would not be equal to\nit. You will have to weigh the pulp, seeds, shell and everything. That which\nhas pulp has also seeds and shell. Similarly, that which is the Absolute has\nalso all phenomena. Therefore I take both the Absolute Reality and the\nphenomenal reality. I do not blow away the phenomenal world by calling it a\ndream, because then the weight will be less.\n\nMahima: This is a wonderful harmony. From the Absolute to the phenomenal and\nfrom the phenomenal to the Absolute.\n\nRamakrishna: Those who are Jnanis (monists) look at the world as a dream, but\nthe realistic Bhaktas take every state as real. There are some cows who pick\nonly certain tufts of grass\n\np. 96\n\nand give very little milk; but there are other cows who eat all kinds of grass\nand give plenty of milk. The Jnanis may be compared to the former, and the\nBhaktas to the latter. The highest of the Bhaktas take both the Absolute and\nthe phenomenal; therefore when they come down from the Absolute to the plane\nof relativity, they continue to enjoy the Absolute through the phenomenal.\nMeaning of Om.(To Mahima) You explain Om as containing three letters, A-u-m.\n\nMahima: Revered Sir, A-u-m means creation, preservation and destruction.\n\nRamakrishna: But for me it is like the sound d-o-n-g of a big bell, which is\nat first audible, then inaudible, and ultimately melts away into infinite\nspace. So the phenomenal melts away in the Absolute; the gross, subtle and\ncausal states lose themselves in the Great Cause, the Absolute; the waking,\ndream and dreamless sleep states become merged in the fourth state, Samadhi.\nWhen the bell sounds, it creates waves like those in the ocean when a heavy\nstone is thrown into it. From the Absolute phenomena come out, from the same\nAbsolute, which is the great First Cause, have also evolved the gross, subtle\nand causal bodies.\n\np. 97\n\n[paragraph continues] From the same Absolute, again, which is the fourth\nstate, come the other three states of consciousness. The waves of the ocean\nare once more dissolved in the ocean. By this illustration of d-o-n-g I show\nthat the eternal word _Om_ is symbolic of the evolution and involution of\nphenomena from and into the Absolute. I have _seen_ all these things. My\nDivine Mother has shown me that in the infinite ocean of the Absolute, waves\nrise and again merge into it. In that infinite spiritual space millions of\nplanets and worlds rise and are dissolved. I do not know what is written in\nyour books; I have seen all this.\n\nMahima: Those who had realized, did not write the books. They were intoxicated\nby their own realization. They forgot everything, how could they write? To\nwrite something is to have a calculating intellect. Others having learned from\nthem, have written and their writings are known as Scriptures.\n\nWhen is attained worldly attachment vanishes.God Ramakrishna: Worldly people\nsay that it is impossible to be free from attachment to worldliness. But when\nGod is attained, all worldly attachment vanishes. After realizing the absolute\nbliss of God-consciousness one cannot enjoy sense-pleasures or run after fame,\nhonor or any\n\np. 98\n\nworldly object. Moths after once seeing the light do not return to the\ndarkness. As much as one thinks of God and meditates on Him, by so much will\none lose one\'s taste for worldly pleasures. As much as one\'s love and devotion\nfor God increases, by so much will diminish worldly desires and care for the\nbody. Then one will look upon every woman as mother, upon his own wife as a\nspiritual helpmate; all animal passions will disappear; Divine spirituality\nwill come, and non-attachment to the world; then one will become absolutely\nemancipated even in this life.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[66:*](gork06.htm#fr_18) "Avadhuta" is a Sanskrit title which is given to one\nwho has become the absolute master of nature and who has realized God. Such a\ngreat soul was Dattatreya. In the Puranas he is called the Avadhuta. He was\nalso the author of the "Avadhuta Gita," a famous work on the Advaita Vedanta.\n\n[81:*](gork06.htm#fr_19) Mahima was the first name of a Brahmin Zemindar and a\nscholar who was known as Mahima Charan Chuckravarti. He lived the life of a\npure and spiritual householder and regarded Ramakrishna as the greatest Hindu\nsage of the age.\n\n[90:*](gork06.htm#fr_20) The word Rama refers to the Divine Hero described in\nthe Hindu epic called "Ramayana." It is also a name which the Hindu Bhaktas\nuse for the Supreme Lord of the universe.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV. Visit to the Pandit Vidyasagara](gork07.htm)\n\n'
