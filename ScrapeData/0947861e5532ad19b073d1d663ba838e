So he spoke unto his pupils and said: "Go\nforth against Drupada, Rajah of Panchala; smite him in battle and bring him to\nme."\n\nThe cousins could not agree to wage war together by reason of their\njealousies. So the Kauravas, led by Duryodhana, were first to attack Drupada;\nthey rode in their chariots and invaded the hostile capital, and slaked their\nthirst for battle. The warriors of Panchala arose to fight; their shouting was\nlike the roaring of lions, and their arrows were showered as thickly as rain\ndropping from the clouds. The Kauravas were defeated, and they retired in\ndisorder, uttering cries of despair.\n\nThe Pandavas then rushed against the enemies of Drona. Arjuna swept forward in\nhis chariot like to the fire which consumeth all things at the end of time,\nand he destroyed horses and cars and warriors. The battle-roar of Bhima was\nlike to the roar of ocean stricken\n\np. 196\n\nby a tempest; wielding his mace, he struck down elephants big as mountains,\nand many horses and charioteers also, and he covered the ground with rivers of\nblood; as a herdsman driveth his cattle before him, so did Bhima drive before\nhim with his mace the terror-stricken hosts of Panchala.\n\nDrupada endeavoured to turn the tide of battle; surrounded by his mightiest\nmen, he opposed Arjuna. Then a great uproar arose among the Panchala forces,\nfor as the lion leaps upon the leader of a herd of elephants, so did Arjuna\nrush against Drupada. A boastful warrior intervened, but the strong Pandava\novercame him, and at length, after fierce fighting, Arjuna seized Drupada as\nGaruda, king of birds, 1 seizeth a mighty snake after disturbing the waters of\nthe ocean.\n\nThe remnant of the Panchala host then broke and fled, and the Pandavas began\nto lay waste the capital. Arjuna, however, cried unto Bhima: "Remember that\nDrupada is the kinsman of the Kauravas; therefore cease slaying his warriors."\n2\n\nDrupada was led before Drona, who, remembering the proud words of the fallen\nrajah, spoke and said: "At last I have conquered thy kingdom, and thy life is\nin my hands. Is it thy desire now to revive our friendship?"\n\nDrona smiled a little and continued thus: "Brahmans are full of forgiveness;\ntherefore have no fear for thy life, O king. I have not forgotten that we were\nchildren together. So once again I ask for thy friendship, and I grant thee,\nunasked, the half of the kingdom; the other half will be mine, and if it\npleaseth thee we will be friends."\n\np. 197\n\nSaid Drupada: "Thou art indeed noble and great. I thank thee, and desire to be\nthy friend."\n\nSo Drona took possession of half of the kingdom. Drupada, who sorrowed\ngreatly, went to rule the southern Panchalas; he was convinced that he could\nnot defeat Drona by Kshatriya power alone, which is inferior to Brahman power,\nand he resolved to discover means whereby he might obtain a son who could\novercome his Brahman enemy.\n\nThereafterwards the Pandavas waged war against neighbouring kings, and they\nextended the territory over which the blind maharajah held sway.\n\nThe Kauravas were rendered more jealous than ever by the successes achieved by\nthe Pandavas, and also because the people favoured them. Now Duryodhana\ndesired to become heir to the throne, but the elder prince of the conquering\nPandavas could not be set aside. In the end Yudhishthira was chosen, although\nunwillingly, by the blind king, and he became Yuva-rajah, "Little Rajah",\nsupplanting Bhishma, who had been regent during the minority. Yudhishthira,\naccordingly, ruled over the kingdom, and he was honoured and beloved by the\npeople; for although he was not a mighty warrior like Arjuna, or powerful like\nto Bhima, he had great wisdom, and he was ever just and merciful, and a lover\nof truth. 1\n\nDuryodhana remonstrated with his blind father, the maharajah, and he spoke to\nhim, saying: "Why, O my father, hast thou thus favoured the Pandavas and\nforgotten thine own sons? Thou wert Pandu\'s elder brother, and should have\nreigned before him. Now the children of thy younger brother are to succeed\nthee. The kingdom is thine own by right of birth, and thy sons are thine\n\np. 198\n\nheirs. Why, then, hast thou lowered us in the eyes of thy subjects?"\n\nSaid the blind Dhritarashtra: "Duryodhana, my son, know thou that Pandu, my\nbrother, was the mightiest ruler in the world. Could I, who have ever been\nblind, have set him aside? His sons have great wisdom and worth, and are loved\nby the people. How, then, could I pass them over? Yudhishthira hath greater\naccomplishments for governing than thou dost possess, my son. How could I turn\nagainst him and banish him from my council?"\n\nDuryodhana said: "I do not acknowledge Yudhishthira\'s superiority as a ruler\nof men. And this I know full well, I could combat against half a score of\nYudhishthiras on the field of battle. . . . If, my father, thou wilt set me\naside and deny me my right to a share of government in the kingdom, I will\ntake mine own life and thus end my sorrow."\n\nSaid Dhritarashtra: "Be patient, O my son, nor give way to thy vexation. If\nsuch is thy desire, I will divide the kingdom between thee and Yudhishthira,\nso that no jealousy may exist between you both."\n\nDuryodhana was well pleased, hearing these words, and he said: "I agree, O my\nfather, and will accept thine offer. Let the Pandavas take their own land and\nrule over it, and I and my brethren will remain at Hastinapur with thee. If\nthe Kauravas and Pandavas continue to dwell here together, there will be\nconflicts and much shedding of blood."\n\nSaid Dhritarashtra: "Neither Bhishma, the head of our family, nor Vidura, my\nbrother, nor Drona, thy preceptor, will consent to the Pandavas being sent\nhence."\n\nDuryodhana made answer: "Consult them not; they are beneath thee, my sire.\nCommand the Pandavas to\n\np. 199\n\ndepart unto the city of Varanavartha 1 and dwell there; when they have gone no\none will speak to thee regarding this matter."\n\nDhritarashtra listened to his son and followed his counsel. He commanded\nYudhishthira to depart with his brethren to the city of Varanavartha, rich in\njewels and gold, to dwell there until he recalled them. Accordingly the\nPandava brethren bade farewell to Dhritarashtra and left Hastinapur, taking\nwith them their mother, the widowed queen Pritha, and went towards the city of\nVaranavartha. The people of Hastinapur mourned for them greatly.\n\nEre they departed, Vidura spoke to them in secret, bidding them to be aware of\nthe perils of fire. He repeated a verse to Yudhishthira and said: "Put thy\ntrust in the man who will recite these words unto thee; he will be thy\ndeliverer."\n\nNow Duryodhana had plotted with Shakuni, the brother of Queen Gandhari, to\naccomplish the destruction of his kinsmen. Then their ally, Kanika the\nBrahman, said in secret to Dhritarashtra: "When thine enemy is in thy power,\ndestroy him by whatever means is at thy disposal, in secret or openly. Show\nhim no mercy, nor give him thy protection. If thy son, or brother, or kinsman,\nor thy father even, should become thine enemy, do not hesitate to slay if thou\nwouldst have prosperity. Let him be overcome either by spells, or by curses,\nor by deception, or by payment of money. Do not forget thine enemy, even\nalthough thou mayst disdain him."\n\nThe maharajah lent a willing ear thereafter to the counsel of his son, whom,\nin his secret heart, he favoured most.\n\np. 200\n\nEre the Pandavas had left Hastinapur, Duryodhana sent unto Varanavartha his\nsecret agent, Purochana, to erect a commodious new dwelling for them. This was\naccomplished with all speed, and it became known as the "house of lac". It was\nbuilt of combustible material: much hemp and resin were packed in the walls\nand between the floors, and it was plastered over with mortar well mixed with\npitch and clarified butter.\n\nPurochana welcomed the Pandavas when they arrived at Varanavartha, and they\nwondered at the splendour of the great new dwelling. But Yudhishthira smelt\nthe mortar, and he went over the whole house examining it closely; then he\nsaid unto Bhima: "The enemy hath caused this mansion to be erected for us, and\ntheir trusted workers have done well for them, for it is full of hemp and\nstraw, resin and bamboo, and the mortar is mixed with pitch and clarified\nbutter."\n\nIn due time a stranger visited the Pandavas, and he repeated the secret verse\nwhich Vidura had communicated to Yudhishthira. He said: "I will construct for\nyou a secret passage underground which will lead to a place of safety, lest\nyou should have to escape from this house when the doors are made secure and\nit is set on fire."\n\nSo the man set to work in secret, and ere long the underground passage was\nready. Then Bhima resolved to deal with Purochana in the very manner that he\nhad undertaken to deal with the princes.\n\nOne evening Pritha gave a feast in the new dwelling to all the poor people in\nVaranavartha. When the guests had taken their departure, there remained behind\na poor Bhil woman and her five sons, who had drunken heavily, as was the\ncustom of their people, and were unable to rise up. They slumbered on the\nfloor.\n\np. 201\n\nA great windstorm had arisen, and the night was dark. So Bhima deemed that the\ntime had come to accomplish his purpose. He went outside and secured the doors\nof the dwelling of Purochana, which stood beside that of the Pandavas; then he\nset it on fire. Soon the flames spread towards the new mansion which had been\nerected according to Duryodhana\'s desire, and it burned fiercely and speedily.\nPritha and her sons made swift escape by the underground passage and took\nrefuge in the jungle. In the morning the people discovered among the embers of\nPurochana\'s house the blackened remains of his body and the bodies of his\nservants. In the ruins of the Pandavas\' dwelling they found that a woman and\nfive men had perished, and they lamented, believing that Pritha and her sons\nwere dead. There was great sorrow in Hastinapur when the tidings were borne\nthither. All the people bewailed the fate of the Pandavas. Bhishma and Vidura\nwept, and blind Dhritarashtra was moved to tears also. But Duryodhana rejoiced\nin secret, believing that his enemies had all been destroyed.\n\nThe Pandavas, having escaped through the subterranean passage, hastened\nsouthwards and entered the forest, which abounded with reptiles and wild\nanimals and with ferocious man-eating Asuras and Rakshasas of gigantic\nstature. Weary and footsore were they all, and greatly oppressed with\nsleepiness and fear. At length the mighty Bhima lifted up all the others and\nhastened on through the darkness: he took his mother on his back, and Madri\'s\nsons on his shoulders, and Yudhishthira and Arjuna under his arms. He went\nswifter than the wind, breaking down trees by his breast and furrowing the\nground that he stamped upon. The whole forest was shaken as with fear.\n\np. 202\n\nAt length the Pandavas, fatigued and athirst and heavy with sleep, found a\nplace to rest in safety; and they all lay down to slumber below a great and\nbeautiful Banyan tree except mighty Bhima, who kept watch over them.\n\nNow there lived in the forest on a Shala tree a ferocious Rakshasa named\nHidimva. He was of grim visage and terrible to behold; his eyes were red, and\nhe was red-haired and red-bearded; his cheeks were of cloud colour and his\nmouth was large, with long, sharp-pointed teeth, which gleamed in darkness;\nhis ears were shaped like to arrows; his neck was broad as a tree, his belly\nwas large, and his legs were of great length.\n\nThe monster was exceedingly hungry on that fateful night. Scenting human flesh\nin the forest, he yawned and scratched his grizzly beard, and spoke to his\nsister, saying: "I smell excellent food, and my mouth waters; to-night I will\ndevour warm flesh and drink hot, frothy blood. Hasten, now, and bring the\nsleeping men unto me; we will eat them together, and afterwards dance merrily\nin the wood."\n\nThen the Rakshasa woman went towards the place where the Pandavas slept. When\nshe beheld Bhima, the long-armed one, clad in royal garments and wearing his\njewels, she immediately fell in love with him, and she said to herself: "This\nman with the shoulders of a lion and eyes like to lotus blooms is worthy to be\nmy husband. I will not slay him for my evil brother."\n\nNow a Rakshasa woman has power to transform herself, and this one at once\nassumed the shape of a beautiful woman; her face became as fair as the full\nmoon; on her head was a garland of flowers, her hair hung in ringlets;\ndelicate was the hue of her skin, and she wore rich ornaments of gold with\nmany gems. Timidly she approached\n\np. 203\n\n[paragraph continues] Bhima and spoke to him, saying: "O bull among men, who\nart thou and whence comest thou? Who are these fair ones lying in slumber\nthere? Hear and know that this forest is the abode of the wicked chieftain of\nthe Rakshasas. He is my brother, and hath sent me hither to kill you all for\nfood, but I desire to save thee, O long-armed one. Be thou my husband. I will\ntake thee to a secret place among the mountains, for I can speed through the\nair at will."\n\nSaid Bhima: "I cannot leave my mother and my brethren to become food for a\nRakshasa."\n\nThe woman said: "Let me be thy servant. Awaken thy mother and thy brethren and\nI will rescue you all from my fierce brother."\n\nSaid Bhima: "I will not awaken them from pleasant and needful slumber, because\nI do not fear a Rakshasa. O fair one, thou canst go as it pleaseth thee, and I\ncare not if thou dost send thy brother unto me."\n\nMeantime the Rakshasa chieftain had grown impatient. He descended from his\ntree and hastened after his sister, with gaping mouth and head thrown back.\nDarkly blue was his body, like to a raincloud.\n\nThe Rakshasa woman said to Bhima: "He cometh hither in wrath. Awaken thy\nkinsfolk, and I will carry you all through the air to escape him."\n\nSaid Bhima: "Look on my arms, which are strong as the trunks of elephants; my\nlegs are like iron maces, and my chest is indeed powerful and broad. I will\nslay this man-eater, thy brother."\n\nThe Rakshasa chieftain heard the boast of Bhima, and he fumed with rage when\nhe beheld his sister in comely human guise, and said to her: "I will slay thee\nand those whom thou wouldst fain help against me." Then he rushed against her,\nbut Bhima cried: "Thou\n\np. 204\n\nwilt not kill a woman while I am near. I challenge thee to single combat now.\nThis night will thy sister behold thee slain by me as an elephant is slain by\na lion."\n\nSaid the Rakshasa: "Boast not until thou art the victor. I will kill thee\nfirst of all, then thy friends, and last of all my treacherous sister."\n\nHaving spoken thus, he rushed towards Bhima, who nimbly seized the monster\'s\noutstretched arms and, wrestling violently, cast him on the ground. Then as a\nlion drags off his prey, Bhima dragged the struggling Rakshasa into the depths\nof the forest, lest his yells should awaken the sleepers. There they fought\ntogether like furious bull elephants, tearing down branches and overthrowing\ntrees.\n\nAt length the dread clamour awoke the Pandavas, and they gazed with wonder on\nthe beautiful woman who kept watch in Bhima\'s place.\n\nSaid Pritha: "O celestial being, who art thou? If thou art the goddess of\nwoods or an Apsara, tell me why thou dost linger here?"\n\nThe fair demon said: "I am the sister of the chieftain of the Rakshasas, and I\nwas sent hither to slay you all; but when I beheld thy mighty son the love god\nwounded me, and I chose him for my husband. Then my brother followed angrily,\nand thy son is fighting with him, and they are filling the forest with their\nshouting."\n\nAll the brethren rushed to Bhima\'s aid, and they saw the two wrestlers\nstruggling in a cloud of dust, and they appeared like two high cliffs shrouded\nin mist.\n\nArjuna cried out: "O Bhima, I am here to help thee. Let me slay the monster."\n\nBhima answered: "Fear not, but look on. The Rakshasa will not escape from my\nhands."\n\nSaid Arjuna: "Do not keep him alive too long. We\n\np. 205\n\nmust hasten hence. The dawn is near, and Rakshasas become stronger at\ndaybreak; they exercise their powers of deception during the two twilights. Do\nnot play with him, therefore, but kill him speedily."\n\nAt these words Bhima became strong as Vayu, his sire, when he is angered, 1\nand, raising aloft the Rakshasa, he whirled him round and round, crying: "In\nvain hast thou gorged on unholy food. I will rid the forest of thee. No longer\nwilt thou devour human beings."\n\nThen, dashing the monster to the ground, Bhima seized him by the hair and by\nthe waist, laid him over a knee, and broke his back. So was the Rakshasa\nslain.\n\nDay was breaking, and Pritha and her sons immediately turned away to leave the\nforest. The Rakshasa woman followed them, and Bhima cried to her: "Begone! or\nI will send thee after thy brother."\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "It is unseemly to slay a woman. Besides, she is the sister\nof that Rakshasa, and even although she became angry, what harm can she do\nus?"\n\nKneeling at Pritha\'s feet, the demon wailed: "O illustrious and blessed lady,\nthou knowest the sufferings women endure when the love god wounds them. Have\npity upon me now, and command thy son to take me for his bride, If he\ncontinues to scorn me, I will slay myself. Let me be thy slave, and I will\ncarry you all wheresoever you desire and protect you from perils."\n\nPritha heard her with compassion, and prevailed upon Bhima to take her for his\nbride. So the two were married by Yudhishthira; then the Rakshasa took Bhima\nupon her back and sped through the air to a lonely place among the mountains\nwhich is sacred to the gods. They lived together beside silvery streams and\nlakes sparkling with\n\np. 206\n\nlotus blooms; they wandered through woods of blossoming trees where birds sang\nsweetly, and by celestial sea-beaches covered with pearls and nuggets of gold.\nThe demon bride had assumed celestial beauty, and ofttimes played sweet music,\nand she made Bhima happy.\n\nIn time the woman became the mother of a mighty son; his eyes were fiercely\nbright, like arrows were his ears, and his mouth was large; he had copper-\nbrown lips and long, sharp teeth. He grew to he a youth an hour after he was\nborn, but, still remaining bald, his mother named him Ghatotkacha, which\nsignifies "pot-headed". 1\n\nBhima then returned to his mother and his brethren with his demon bride and\nher son. They abode together for a time in the forest; then the Rakshasa bade\nall the Pandavas farewell and departed with Ghatotkacha, who promised to come\nto aid the Pandavas whenever they called upon him.\n\nOne day thereafter Vyasa appeared before the Pandavas and counselled them to\ngo towards the city of Eka-chakra 2 and to live there for a time in the house\nof a Brahman. Then he vanished from sight, promising to come again.\n\nThe Pandavas went therefore to Eka-chakra and lived with a Brahman who had a\nwife and a daughter and an infant son. Disguised as holy men, the brethren\nbegged for food as alms. Every evening they brought home what they had\nobtained, and Pritha divided the whole into two portions; the one half she\ngave to wolf-bellied Bhima, and the rest she kept for his brethren and\nherself.\n\nNow the city of Eka-chakra was protected against every enemy by a forest-\ndwelling Rakshasa named Vaka,\n\np. 207\n\nwho was king of the Asuras. 1 Each day the people had to supply him with food,\nwhich consisted of a cartload of rice, two bullocks, and the man who conveyed\nthe meal to him.\n\nOne morning a great wailing broke forth in the Brahman\'s house because that\nthe holy man was required to supply the demon\'s feast. He was too poor to\npurchase a slave, and he said he would deliver himself unto Vaka. "Although I\nreach Heaven," he cried, "I will have no joy, for my family will perish when I\nam gone." His wife and his daughter pleaded in turn to take his place, and the\nthree wept together. Then the little boy of tender years plucked a long spear\nof grass, and with glowing eyes he spoke sweetly and said: "Do not weep,\nFather; do not weep, Mother; do not weep, Sister. With this spear I will slay\nthe demon who devours human beings."\n\nAs they wept there they heard him, nor could forbear smiling.\n\nPritha was deeply moved by the lamentations of the Brahman family, and she\nsaid: "Sorrow not. I will send forth my son Bhima to slay the Asura king."\n\nThe Brahman made answer, saying: "That cannot be. Thy sons are Brahmans and\nare under my protection. If I go forth, I will but obey the rajah; if I send\nthy son, I will be sin-guilty of his death, for the gods abhor the man who\ncauseth a guest to be slain, or permits a Brahman to perish."\n\nSaid Pritha: "Bhima is strong and mighty, nor can a demon do him any harm. He\nwill slay this bloodthirsty Rakshasa and return again in safety. But, O\nBrahman, thou must not reveal unto anyone who hath performed\n\np. 208\n\nthis mighty deed, lest the people should trouble my son and desire to obtain\nthe secret of his power, for he is skilled in mantras." 1\n\nThen was the household made happy, and Bhima prepared to go forth. That mighty\nhero collected the rice and drove the bullocks towards the forest. When he\ndrew nigh to the appointed place, he began to eat the food himself; and called\nthe Rakshasa by name over and over again. Vaka heard and came through the\ntrees towards Bhima. Red were his eyes, and his hair and his beard were red\nalso; his ears were pointed like arrows; he had a mouth like a cave, and his\nforehead was puckered in three lines. Terrible was he to look upon; his body\nwas huge, indeed. 2\n\nThe Rakshasa saw Bhima eating his meal, and approached angrily, biting his\nlower lip. "Fool," he cried, "wouldst thou devour my food before my very\neyes?"\n\nBhima smiled, and continued eating with face averted. The demon smote him, but\nthe hero only glanced round as if one had touched his shoulder, and he went on\neating as before.\n\nRaging furiously, the Rakshasa tore up a tree, and Bhima rose leisurely and\nwaited until it was flung at him. When that was done, he caught the trunk\nnimbly and hurled it back. Many trees were uprooted and flung by one at the\nother. Then Vaka sprung forward to wrestle, but the Pandava overthrew him and\ndragged\n\np. 209\n\nhim round and round until the demon gasped with fatigue. The earth shook;\ntrees were splintered in pieces. Then Bhima began to strike the monster with\nhis iron fists, and at length he broke Vaka\'s back across his knee. Terrible\nwere the loud screams of the Rakshasa while Bhima was bending him double. He\ndied howling.\n\nA mighty clamour was then awakened in the forest. All the other Asuras were\nterror-stricken, and, bellowing horribly, they hastened towards Bhima and made\nobeisance before him. Then Bhima made them take vows never again to eat human\nflesh or to oppress the people of the city. They promised willing obedience,\nand he allowed them to depart.\n\nThereafter Pritha\'s son dragged the monster\'s body to the main gate of Eka-\nchakra. He entered the city secretly and hastened to the Brahman\'s house, and\nhe told Yudhishthira all that had taken place.\n\nWhen the people of the city discovered that the Asura king had been slain,\nthey rejoiced greatly, and hastened towards the house of the Brahman. But that\nholy man made evasive answer to them, and said that his deliverer was a\ncertain high-souled Brahman who had offered to supply food to the demon.\nThereafter the people established a festival in honour of Brahmans.\n\nThe Pandavas remained a time in the city, and they studied the Vedas. One day\nthere came to their dwelling a saintly man of rigid vows, and he told the\nstory of the miraculous births of Drupada\'s son and daughter from sacrificial\nfire.\n\nWhen Drupada had lost half of his kingdom, he paid pilgrimages to holy places.\nHe promised great rewards to superior Brahmans, so that he might have\noffspring, ever desiring greatly to be avenged upon Drona. He\n\np. 210\n\noffered the austere Upayaja a million cows if he would procure a son for him,\nand that sage sent him unto his brother Yaja. Now Yaja was reluctant to aid\nthe rajah thus; but at length he consented to perform the sacrificial rite,\nand prevailed upon Upayaja to help him.\n\nSo the rite was performed, and when the vital moment came, the Brahmans called\nfor the queen to partake in it. But Drupada\'s wife was not prepared, and said:\n"My mouth is still filled with saffron and my body is scented. I am not fit to\nreceive the libation which will bring offspring. Tarry a little time for me."\n\nBut the Brahmans could not delay the consummation of the sacrificial rite. Ere\nthe queen came, a son sprang forth from the flames: he was clad in full\narmour, and carried a falchion and bow, and a diadem gleamed brightly upon his\nhead. A voice out of the heavens said: " _This Prince hath come to destroy\nDrona and to increase the fame of the Panchalas_ ".\n\nNext arose from the ashes on the altar a daughter of great beauty. She was\nexceedingly dark, with long curling locks and lotus eyes, and she was deep-\nbosomed and slender-waisted. A sweet odour clung to her body.\n\nA voice out of heaven said: " _This dusky girl will become the chief of all\nwomen. Many Kshatriyas must die because of her, and the Kauravas will suffer\nfrom her. She will accomplish the decrees of the gods_."\n\nThen the son was called Dhrishta-dyumna 1 and the daughter Draupadi. 2 Drona\nthereafter took the Panchala prince to his palace, and instructed him to\nbecome an accomplished warrior. He knew that he could not thwart destiny, and\nhe desired to perpetuate his own mighty deeds.\n\np. 211\n\nHaving heard these words, Pritha desired to journey towards Panchala, and she\nand her sons took leave of their host. Ere they went away, the high-souled\nascetic said that Draupadi had been destined to become a Pandava queen.\n\nPritha and her sons wandered from the banks of the Ganges and went northwards,\nand soon they fell in with great numbers of people all going the same way.\nYudhishthira spake to a troop of Brahmans, and asked them whither they were\nbound, and they answered saying that Drupada of Panchala was observing a great\nfestival, and that all the princes of the land were hastening to the\nswayamvara of his peerless and slender-waisted daughter, the beautiful\nDraupadi.\n\nIn that great and increasing company were Brahmans who were to perform the\nsacred rites, and youths who were to take part in joyous revelry--dancers and\njugglers, boxers and wrestlers, and those who displayed feats of strength and\nskill at arms; there were also bards there and singers to chant the praises of\nheroes.\n\nThe Brahmans praised the beauty of Draupadi, and said to the Pandava brethren:\n"Come with us to the festival and the sports and the swayamvara; you will be\nfeasted and will receive gifts. You are all as comely as princes and as fair\nas the bright gods; mayhap Draupadi may choose from among ye this stalwart and\nnoble youth, strongly armed and of fearless bearing, and if he should perform\nmighty feats, the garland may be thrown upon his shoulders."\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "So be it. We will hasten with you to the swayamvara and\nshare banquet and bounty."\n\nSo the Pandavas went towards Panchala with the troop of Brahmans. When they\nreached the city they\n\np. 212\n\ntook up their abode in the humble dwelling of a potter, still disguised as\nBrahmans, and they went out and begged food from the people.\n\nIn their secret hearts the brethren desired greatly to win the fair bride\nwhose fame had been bruited abroad.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[196:1](iml17.htm#fr_233) Half man and half eagle, and enemy of the serpent\nrace.\n\n[196:2](iml17.htm#fr_234) The Kurus and Panchalas were allies.\n\n[197:1](iml17.htm#fr_235) The modern-day Hindu regards Yudhishthira as an\nideal man.\n\n[199:1](iml17.htm#fr_236) Allahabad, then probably a frontier town of the area\nof Aryan control, pronounced Var\xc2\xb4an-a-vart\xe2\x80\xb3ha.\n\n[205:1](iml17.htm#fr_237) The god of wind.\n\n[206:1](iml17.htm#fr_238) Bald as a pot. _Pron_. gat-ot-katch\xc2\xb4a.\n\n[206:2](iml17.htm#fr_239) _Pron_. eka-chak\xc2\xb4ra.\n\n[207:1](iml17.htm#fr_240) As a rule the Asuras are the enemies of the gods and\nthe Rakshasas the enemies of mankind.

When a late wayfarer began to walk over, the\nmonster growled, "Tramp, tramp, tramp", so as to terrify him and obtain him\nfor food. According to local belief, the demon "had eyes like a saucer, a nose\nlike a poker, and a mouth like a cave". The Egyptian demon set was red like\nthe Indian Rakshasa.
