After one year the _K_ u _d_ akarman (i.e. the tonsure of the child's\nhead);\n\n2\\. Or in the third year;\n\n3\\. In the fifth for a Kshatriya;\n\n4\\. In the seventh for a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n5\\. Having placed the fire (in the outer hall; see chap. 5, 2)\xc2\x97\n\n6\\. And having filled vessels with rice and barley, sesamum seeds and beans,\n\n7\\. And having put down northwards bull-dung and a layer of Ku _s_ a grass for\nreceiving the hair, a mirror, fresh butter, and a razor of copper,\n\n8\\. He pours cold water into warm with (the verse), 'Mix yourselves, ye holy\nones, with your waves, ye honied ones, mixing milk with honey, ye lovely ones,\nfor the obtaining of wealth.'\n\n9\\. 'May the waters moisten thee for life, for old age and splendour. The\nthreefold age of _G_ amadagni, Ka _s_ yapa's threefold age, the threefold age\nof\n\np. 56\n\n[paragraph continues] Agastya, the threefold age that belongs to the gods,\nthat threefold age I produce for thee! N.N.!'\xc2\x97with these words he sprinkles\nthe right part of his hair three times with lukewarm water.\n\n10\\. Having loosened the tangled locks, according to some (teachers), with a\nporcupine's quill,\n\n11\\. And having anointed (his hair)with fresh butter,\n\n12\\. He puts a young Ku _s_ a shoot among (the hairs) with the words, 'Herb,\nprotect him!'\n\n13\\. Having touched the hair and the Ku _s_ a shoot with the mirror,\n\n14\\. He takes up the copper razor with the words, Sharpness art thou; the axe\nis thy father. Do no harm to him!'\n\n15 15. With (the words), 'The razor with which in the beginning Savitar, the\nknowing one, has shaven the beard of king Varu _n_ a, and with which Dhatar B\n_ri_ haspati has shaven Indra's head, with that, ye Brahma _n_ as, shave this\n(head) to-day; blessed with long life, with old age be this man N.N.!' he cuts\nthe tips of the hairs and the Ku _s_ a shoot.\n\n16\\.

So the\ncorrect translation would be, '. . . with what Dhatar has shaven B _ri_\nhaspati's and Indra's head, with that do ye Brahma _n_ as shave this head of\nthis (child).'\n\n[57:24](sbe29030.htm#fr_119) See Sutra 6.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1](sbe29031.htm)\n\n"
