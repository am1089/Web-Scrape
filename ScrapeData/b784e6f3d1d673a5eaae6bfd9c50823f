But there are\ntome who say, that there was non-Being in the beginning, alone and secondless;\nso that Being would be born from non-Being; but how could this be so, dear?\nsaid he; how could Being be born from non-Being? So there was Being, dear, in\nthe beginning, alone and secondless.\n\np. 47\n\nThen Being beholding said: Let me become great; let me give birth.\n\nThen it put forth Radiance.\n\nThen Radiance beholding said: Let me become great; let me give birth.\n\nThen it put forth the Waters. Just as a man is hot and sweats, so from\nradiance the waters are born.\n\nThen the Waters beholding said: Let us become great; let us give birth.\n\nThey put forth the world-food. Just as when it rains much food is produced, so\nfrom the Waters the world-food-- _Earth_ --is born.\n\n\n\nOf all these, of beings, there are three germs: what is born of the Egg, what\nis born of Life, what is born of Division.\n\nThat power-- _Being_ --beholding said: Let me enter these three powers--\n_Radiance, Waters, Earth_ --by this life, by my Self, let me give them\nmanifold forms and names. Let me make each one of them threefold, threefold.\n\nSo that power-- _Bring_ --entered those three powers-- _Radiance, Waters,\nEarth_ --by this life, by the Self,\n\np. 48\n\nand gave them manifold forms and names; and so made each one of them\nthreefold, threefold. And now learn, dear, how these three powers are, how\neach one of them becomes threefold, threefold.\n\n\n\nIn fire, the radiant form is from Radiance; the dear form, from the Waters;\nthe dark form, from Earth. But the separate nature of fire is a thing of names\nand words only, while the real thing is the three forms.\n\nSo of the sun, the radiant form is from Radiance; the dear form, from the\nWaters; the dark form, from Earth. But the separate nature of the sun is a\nthing of names and words only, while the real thing is the three forms.\n\nSo of the moon, the radiant form is from Radiance; the clear form, from the\nWaters; the dark form, from Earth. But the separate nature of the moon is a\nthing of names and words only, while the real thing is the three forms.\n\nSo of lightning, the radiant form is from Radiance; the clear form, from the\nWaters; the dark form, from\n\np. 49\n\n[paragraph continues] Earth. But the separate nature of lightning is a thing\nof names and words only, the real thing is the three forms.\n\nTherefore of old time those who knew this, the great sages and teachers of\nold, spoke thus: None of us may now speak of anything as unheard, unthought,\nunknown.\n\nFor by these three forms they knew everything. For whatever was like radiant,\nits form was from Radiance, they said, and thus knew it. And whatever was like\nclear, its form was from the Waters, they said, and so knew it. And whatever\nwas like dark, its form was from Earth, they said, and so knew it. Thus\nwhatever was known they took to be a union of these three powers, and thus\nthey knew it.\n\nBut how these three powers are, dear, when they come to man, bow each of them\nbecomes threefold, this learn from me now.\n\n\n\nFood that is eaten is divided threefold. Its grossest part becomes waste; its\nmiddle part becomes flesh; its lightest part becomes Mind.\n\np. 50\n\nWaters that are drunk are divided threefold. The grossest part becomes waste;\nthe middle part becomes blood; the lightest part becomes vital Breath.\n\nThings that produce radiant heat, when absorbed, are divided threefold. The\ngrossest part becomes bone; the middle part becomes nerve; the lightest part\nbecomes formative Voice.\n\nFor Mind, dear, is formed of the world-food-- _Earth_ ; vital Breath is formed\nof the Waters; formative Voice is formed of Radiance.\n\nLet my master teach me further; said he.\n\nBe it so, dear; said he.\n\n\n\nOf churned milk, dear, the lightest part rises to the top and becomes butter.\nJust so of eaten food, dear, the lightest part rises to the top and becomes\nMind. And so of waters that are drunk, the lightest part rises to the top, and\nbecomes vital Breath. And so when heat-giving things are eaten, the lightest\npart rises to the top, and becomes formative Voice.\n\nFor Mind, dear, is formed of Food;\n\np. 51\n\nvital Breath is formed of the Waters; formative Voice is formed of Radiance.\n\nLet my Master teach me further; said he.\n\n\n\nBe it so, dear; said he.\n\nMan, dear, is made of sixteen parts. Eat nothing for fifteen days, but drink\nas much as you wish; for vital Breath, being formed of the Waters, is cut off\nif you do not drink.\n\nHe ate nothing for fifteen days, and then returned to the Master, saying: What\nshall I repeat, Master?\n\nRepeat the songs and liturgies and chants, dear; said he.\n\nNone of them come back into my mind, Master; said he.\n\nHe said to him: As, dear, after a big fire, if a single spark remain, as big\nas a fire-fly, it will not burn much; just so, dear, of your sixteen parts one\nremains, and by this one part you cannot remember the teachings.\n\nGo, eat; and then you will understand me.\n\nHe ate, and then returned to the Master; and whatever the Master asked, all\ncame back to his mind.\n\np. 52\n\nThe Master said to him: As, dear, after a big fire, if even a single spark\nremain, as big as a fire-fly, and if it be fed with straw, it will blaze up\nand will then burn much; just so, dear, of your sixteen parts, one part was\nleft; and this, being fed with food, blazed up, and through it you remembered\nthe teachings.\n\nFor Mind is formed of Food; vital Breath is formed of the Waters; formative\nVoice is formed of Radiance.\n\nThus he learned; thus, verily, he learned.\n\n\n\n![](img/ainit.jpg)  \n---  \nARUNA'S son Uddalaka addressed his son Shvetaketu, saying: Learn from me,\ndear, the reality about sleep. When a man sinks to sleep, as they say, then,\ndear, he is wrapped by the Real; he has slipped back to his own. And so they\nsay he sleeps, because he has slipped back to his own. And just as an eagle\ntied by a cord, flying hither and thither, and finding no other resting place,\ncomes to rest where he is tied, so indeed, dear, the man's Mind flying hither\nand thither, and\n\np. 53\n\nfinding no other resting place, comes to rest in vital Breath; for Mind, dear,\nis bound by vital Breath.\n\nLearn from me, dear, the meaning of hunger and thirst. When a man hungers, as\nthey say, the Waters guide what he eats. And as there are guides of cows,\nguides of horses, guides of men, so they call the Waters the guides of what is\neaten. Thus you must know, dear, that what he eats grows and sprouts forth;\nand it cannot grow without a root.\n\nAnd where can the root of what he eats be? Where, but in the world-food--\n_Earth?_\n\nAnd through the world-food-- _Earth_ --that has sprouted forth, you must seek\nthe root, the Waters. And through the waters that have sprouted forth, you\nmust seek the root, Radiance. And through Radiance that has sprouted forth,\nyou must seek the root, the Real. For all these beings, dear, are rooted in\nthe Real, resting in the Real, abiding in the Real.\n\nAnd so when the man thirsts, as they say, the Radiance guides what he drinks.\nAnd as there are guides\n\np. 54\n\nof cows, guides of horses, guides of men, so, they say, the Radiance guides\nthe Waters. Thus you must know, dear, that what he drinks grows and sprouts\nforth; and it cannot grow without a root.\n\nAnd where can the root of what he drinks be? Where, but in the Waters? And\nthrough the Waters that sprout forth, you must seek their root, the Radiance.\nAnd through the Radiance, dear, that sprouts forth, you must seek its root,\nthe Real. For all these beings, dear, are rooted in the Real, resting in the\nReal, abiding in the Real. And how these three: the world-food--Earth--the\nWaters, Radiance, coming to a man, become each threefold, threefold, this has\nbeen taught already.\n\nAnd of a man who goes forth, formative Voice sinks back into Mind; Mind sinks\nback into vital Breath, vital Breath to Radiance, and Radiance to the higher\nDivinity. This is the soul, the Self of all that is, this is the Real, this\nthe Self, That thou art, O Shvetaketu.\n\nLet the Master teach me more; said he.\n\np. 55\n\nLet it be so, dear; said he.\n\nAs the honey-makers, dear, gather the honey from many a tree, and weld the\nnectars together in a single nectar; and as they find no separateness there,\nnor say: Of that tree I am the nectar, of that tree I am the nectar. Thus,\nindeed, dear, all these beings, when they reach the Real, know not, nor say:\nWe have reached the Real. But whatever they are here, whether tiger or lion or\nwolf or boar or worm or moth or gnat or fly, that they become again. And this\nsoul is the Self of all that is, this is the Real, this the Self. That thou\nart, O Shvetaketu.\n\nLet the Master teach me more; said he.\n\nLet it be so, dear; said he.\n\n\n\nThese eastern rivers, dear, roll eastward; and the western, westward. From the\nocean to the ocean they go, and in the ocean they are united. And there they\nknow no separateness, nor say: This am I, this am I. Thus indeed, dear, all\nthese beings, coming forth from the Real, know not, nor say: We have come from\nthe Real.\n\np. 56\n\nAnd whatever they are here, whether tiger or lion or wolf or boar or worm or\nmoth or gnat or fly or whatever they are, that they become again. And that\nsoul is the Self of all that is, this is the Real, this the Self. That thou\nart, O Shvetaketu.\n\nLet the Master teach me more; said he.\n\nLet it be so, dear; said he.\n\n\n\nIf any one strike the root of this great tree, dear, it will flow and live, if\nany one strike the middle of it, it will flow and live; if any one strike the\ntop of it, it will flow and live. So filled with Life, with the Self, drinking\nin and rejoicing, it stands firm. But if the life of it leaves one branch,\nthat branch dries up; it leaves a second, that dries up; it leaves a third,\nthat dries up; it leaves the whole, the whole dries up. Thus indeed, dear, you\nmust understand; said he. When abandoned by Life, verily, this dies; but Life\nitself does not die. For that soul is the Self of all that is, this is the\nReal, this the Self. That thou art, O Shvetaketu.\n\np. 57\n\nLet the Master teach me more; said he.\n\nLet it be so, dear; said he.\n\n\n\nBring me a fruit of that fig-tree. Here is the fruit, Master.\n\nDivide it into two; said he.\n\nI have divided it, Master.\n\nWhat do you see irk it? said he.\n\nAtom-like seeds, Master.\n\nDivide one of them in two; said he.\n\nI have divided it, Master.\n\nWhat do you see in it? said he.\n\nI see nothing at all, Master.\n\nSo he said to him:\n\nThat soul that you perceive not at all, dear,--from that very soul the great\nfig-tree comes forth. Believe then, dear, that this soul is the Self of all\nthat is, this is the Real, this the Self. That thou art, O Shvetaketu.\n\nLet the Master teach me more; said he.\n\n\n\nLet it be so, dear; said he.\n\nPut this salt in water, and come to me early in the morning.\n\nAnd he did so, and the Master said to him:\n\np. 58\n\nThat salt you put in the water last night--bring it to me! And looking for its\nappearance, he could not see it, as it was melted in the water.\n\nTaste the top of it; said he. How is it?\n\nIt is salt; said he.\n\nTaste the middle of it; said he. How is it?\n\nIt is salt; said he.\n\nTaste the bottom of it; said he. How is it?\n\nIt is salt; said he.\n\nTake it away, then, and return to me.\n\nAnd he did so; but that exists for ever. And the master said to him:\n\nJust so, dear, you do not see the Real in the world. Yet it is here all the\nsame. And this soul is the Self of all that is, this is the Real, this the\nSelf. That thou art, O Shvetaketu.\n\nLet the Master teach me more; said he.\n\nLet it be so, dear; said he.\n\n\n\nJust as if they were to blindfold a man, and lead him far away from Gandhara,\nand leave him in the\n\np. 59\n\nwilderness; and as he cried to the east and the north and the west: I am led\naway blindfolded; I am deserted blindfolded. And just as if one came, and\nloosing the bandage from his eyes, told him: In that direction h Gandhara; in\nthat direction you must go. And he asking from village to village like a wise\nman and learned, Mould come safe to Gandhara. Thus, eerily, a man who has\nfound the true Teacher, knows. He must wait only till he is free, there he\nreaches the renting-place. And that soul is the Self of all that is, this is\nthe Real, this the Self. That thou art, O Shvetaketu.\n\nLet the Master teach me more; said he.\n\nLet it be so, dear; said he.\n\n\n\nWhen a man is near his end, his fiends gather round him: Do you mow me, do you\nknow me? they say. And until formative Voice sinks back into Mind, and Mind\ninto Breath, and Breath into the Radiance, and the Radiance into the higher\nDivinity, he still knows them. But when formative Voice sinks back into Mind,\nand Mind\n\np. 60\n\ninto Breath, and Breath into the Radiance, and the Radiance into the higher\nDivinity, he knows them not. And that soul is the Self of all that is, this is\nthe Real, this the Self. That thou art, O Shvetaketu.\n\nLet the Master teach me more; said he.\n\nLet it be so, dear; said he.\n\n\n\nThey bind a man and bring him: He has stolen, they say; he has committed\ntheft. Heat the axe _for the ordeal:_ and if he is the doer of its and makes\nhimself untrue; maintaining untruth, and wrapping himself it untruth, he\ngrasps the heated axe; bums, and so dies. But if he be not the doer of it, he\nmakes himself true; maintaining truth, and wrapping himself in truth, he\ngrasps the heated axe; he burns not, and so goes free. And the truth that\nsaves him from burning is the Self of all that is, this is the Real, this the\nSelf. That thou art, O Shvetaketu.\n\nThus he learned the truth; thus he learned it.\n\np. 61\n\nFOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY COPIES OF THIS BOOK (SECOND EDITION) HAVE BEEN PRINTED\nON VAN GILDER HAND-MADE PAPER, AND TYPE DISTRIBUTED, IN THE MONTH OF\nSEPTEMBER, A.
