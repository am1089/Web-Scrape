The forms of Vishn\xcc\x81u worshipped\nin different Varshas.\n\nMAITREYA.--You have related to me, Brahman, the creation of Swayambhuva; I am\nnow desirous to hear from you a description of the earth: how many are its\noceans and islands, its kingdoms and its mountains, its forests and rivers and\nthe cities of the gods, its dimensions, its contents, its nature, and its\nform.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--You shall hear, Maitreya, a brief account of the earth from me: a\nfull detail I could not give you in a century.\n\nThe seven great insular continents are Jambu, Plaksha, Salmali, Ku\xc5\x9ba,\nKrauncha, \xc5\x9aaka, and Pushkara: and they are surrounded severally by seven great\nseas; the sea of salt water (Lavan\xcc\x81a), of sugar-cane juice (Ikshu), of wine\n(Sura), of clarified butter (Sarpi), of curds (Dadhi), of milk (Dugdha), and\nof fresh water (Jala) 1.\n\nJambu-dwipa is in the centre of all these: and in the centre of this continent\nis the golden mountain Meru. The height of Meru is eighty-four thousand\nYojanas; and its depth below the surface of the earth is\n\np. 167\n\nsixteen thousand. Its diameter at the summit is thirty-two thousand Yojanas;\nand at its base, sixteen thousand: so that this mountain is like the seed-cup\nof the lotus of the earth 2.\n\nThe boundary mountains (of the earth) are Himavan, Hemakut\xcc\x81a, and Nishadha,\nwhich lie south of Meru; and Nila, \xc5\x9aweta, and \xc5\x9aringi, which are situated to\nthe north of it. The two central ranges (those next to Meru, or Nishadha and\nNila) extend for a hundred thousand (Yojanas, running east and west). Each of\nthe others diminishes ten thousand Yojanas, as it lies more remote from the\ncentre. They are two thousand Yojanas in height, and as many in breadth 3. The\nVarshas or countries between these ranges are Bharata (India), south of the\nHimavan mountains;\n\np. 168\n\nnext Kimpurusha, between Himavan and Hemakut\xcc\x81a; north of the latter, and south\nof Nishadha, is Hariversha; north of Meru is Ramyaka, extending from the Nila\nor blue mountains to the \xc5\x9aweta (or white) mountains; Hiran\xcc\x81maya lies between\nthe \xc5\x9aweta and \xc5\x9aringi ranges; and Uttarakuru is beyond the latter, following\nthe same direction as Bharata 4. Each of these is nine thousand Yojanas in\nextent. Ilavrita is of similar dimensions, but in the centre of it is the\ngolden mountain Meru, and the country extends nine thousand Yojanas in each\ndirection from the four sides of the mountain 5. There are four mountains in\nthis Varsha, formed as buttresses to Meru, each ten thousand Yojanas in\nelevation: that on the east is called Mandara; that on the south,\nGandhamadana; that on the west, Vipula; and that on the north, Supar\xc5\x9bwa 6: on\neach of these stands severally a Kadamba-tree, a Jambu-tree, a Pipal, and a\nVat\xcc\x81a 7; each spreading over eleven hundred Yojanas, and towering aloft like\nbanners on the mountains. From the Jambu-tree the insular continent Jambu-\ndwipa derives its appellations. The apples of that tree are as large as\nelephants: when they are rotten, they fall upon the crest of the mountain, and\nfrom their expressed juice is formed the Jambu river, the waters of which are\ndrunk by the inhabitants; and in consequence of drinking of that stream, they\npass their days in content and health, being subject neither to perspiration,\nto foul odours, to decrepitude, nor organic decay. The soil on the banks of\nthe river, absorbing the Jambu juice, and being dried by gentle breezes,\nbecomes the gold termed Jambunada, of which the ornaments of the Siddhas are\nfabricated.\n\np. 169\n\nThe country of Bhadra\xc5\x9bwa lies on the east of Meru, and Ketumala on the west;\nand between these two is the region of Ilavrita. On the east of the same is\nthe forest Chaitraratha; the Gandhamadana wood is on the south; the forest of\nVaibhraja is on the west; and the grove of Indra, or Nandana, is on the north.\nThere are also four great lakes, the waters of which are partaken of by the\ngods, called Arun\xcc\x81oda, Mahabhadra, \xc5\x9aitoda, and Man\xcc\x81asa 8.\n\nThe principal mountain ridges which project from the base of Meru, like\nfilaments from the root of the lotus, are, on the east, \xc5\x9aitanta, Mukunda,\nKurari, Malyavan, and Vaikanka; on the south, Trikut\xcc\x81a, \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bira, Patanga,\nRuchaka, and Nishadha; on the west, \xc5\x9aikhivasas, Vaidurya, Kapila,\nGandhamadana, and Jarudhi; and on the north, \xc5\x9aankhakut\xcc\x81a, Rishabha, Naga,\nHansa, and Kalanjara. These and others extend from between the intervals in\nthe body, or from the heart, of Meru 9.\n\nOn the summit of Meru is the vast city of Brahma, extending fourteen thousand\nleagues, and renowned in heaven; and around it, in the cardinal points and the\nintermediate quarters, are situated the stately cities of Indra and the other\nregents of the spheres 10. The capital of Brahma\n\np. 170\n\nis enclosed by the river Ganges, which, issuing from the foot of Vishn\xcc\x81u, and\nwashing the lunar orb, falls here from the skies 11, and, after encircling the\ncity, divides into four mighty rivers, flowing in opposite directions. These\nrivers are the \xc5\x9aita, the Alakananda, the Chakshu, and the Bhadra. The first,\nfalling upon the tops of the inferior mountains, on the east side of Meru,\nflows over their crests, and passes through the country of Bhadra\xc5\x9bwa to the\nocean: the Alakananda flows south, to the country of Bharata, and, dividing\ninto seven rivers on the way, falls into the sea: the Chakshu falls into the\nsea, after traversing all the western mountains, and passing through the\ncountry of Ketumala: and the\n\np. 171\n\n[paragraph continues] Bhadra washes the country of the Uttara kurus, and\nempties itself into the northern ocean 12.\n\nMeru, then, is confined between the mountains Nila and Nishadha (on the north\nand south), and between Malyavan and Gandhamadana (on the west and east 13):\nit lies between them like the pericarp of a lotus. The countries of Bharata,\nKetumala, Bhadra\xc5\x9bwa, and Uttarakuru lie, like leaves of the lotus of the\nworld, exterior to the boundary mountains. Jat\xcc\x81hara and Devakut\xcc\x81a are two\nmountain ranges, running north and south, and connecting the two chains of\nNishadha and Nila. Gandhamadana\n\np. 172\n\nand Kailasa extend, east and west, eighty Yojanas in breadth, from sea to sea.\nNishadha and Pariyatra are the limitative mountains on the west, stretching,\nlike those on the east, between the Nila and Nishadha ranges: and the\nmountains Tri\xc5\x9bringa and Jarudhi are the northern limits of Meru, extending,\neast and west, between the two seas 14. Thus I have repeated to you the\nmountains described by great sages as the boundary mountains, situated in\npairs, on each of the four sides of Meru. Those also, which have been\nmentioned as the filament mountains (or spurs), \xc5\x9aitanta and the rest, are\nexceedingly delightful. The vallies embosomed amongst them are the favourite\nresorts of the Siddhas and Charan\xcc\x81as: and there are situated upon them\nagreeable forests, and pleasant cities, embellished with the palaces of\nVishn\xcc\x81u, Lakshmi, Agni, Surya, and other deities, and peopled by celestial\nspirits; whilst the Yakshas, Rakshasas, Daityas, and Danavas pursue their\npastimes in the vales. These, in short, are the regions of Paradise, or\nSwarga, the seats of the righteous, and where the wicked do not arrive even\nafter a hundred births.\n\np. 173\n\nIn the country of Bhadra\xc5\x9bwa, Vishn\xcc\x81u resides as Hayasira (the horse-headed);\nin Ketumala, as Varaha (the boar); in Bharata, as the tortoise (Kurma); in\nKuru, as the fish (Matsya); in his universal form, every where; for Hari\npervades all places: he, Maitreya, is the supporter of all things; he is all\nthings. In the eight realms of Kimpurusha and the rest (or all exclusive of\nBharata) there is no sorrow, nor weariness, nor anxiety, nor hunger, nor\napprehension; their inhabitants are exempt from all infirmity and pain, and\nlive in uninterrupted enjoyment for ten or twelve thousand years. Indra never\nsends rain upon them, for the earth abounds with water. In those places there\nis no distinction of Krita, Treta, or any succession of ages. In each of these\nVarshas there are respectively seven principal ranges of mountains, from\nwhich, oh best of Brahmans, hundreds of rivers take their rise 15.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[166:1](vp059.htm#fr_374) The geography of the Puran\xcc\x81as occurs in most of\nthese works; and in all the main features, the seven Dwipas, seven seas, the\ndivisions of Jambu-dwipa, the situation and extent of Meru, and the\nsubdivisions of Bharata, is the same. The Agni and Brahma are word for word\nthe same with our text; and the Kurma, Linga, Matsya, Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, and Vayu\npresent many passages common to them and the Vishn\xcc\x81u, or to one another. The\nVayu, as usual, enters most fully into particulars. The Bhagavata differs in\nits nomenclature of the subordinate details from all, and is followed by the\nPadma. The others either omit the subject, or advert to it but briefly. The\nMahabharata, Bhishma Parva, has an account essentially the same, and many of\nthe stanzas are common to it and different Puran\xcc\x81as. It does not follow the\nsame order, and has some peculiarities; one of which is calling Jambu-dwipa,\nSudar\xc5\x9bana, such being the name of the Jambu-tree: it is said also to consist\nof two portions, called Pippala and \xc5\x9aa\xc5\x9ba, which are reflected in the lunar\norb, as in a mirror.\n\n[167:2](vp059.htm#fr_375) The shape of Meru, according to this description, is\nthat of an inverted cone; and by the comparison to the seed-cup its form\nshould be circular: but there seems to be some uncertainty upon this subject\namongst the Pauran\xcc\x81ics. The Padma compares its form to the bell-shaped flower\nof the Dhatura. The Vayu represents it as having four sides of different\ncolours; or, white on the east, yellow on the south, black on the west, and\nred on the north; but notices also various opinions of the outline of the\nmountain, which, according to Atri, had a hundred angles; to Bhrigu, a\nthousand: Savarni calls it octangular; Bhaguri, quadrangular; and Varshayani\nsays it has a thousand angles: Galava makes it saucer-shaped; Garga, twisted,\nlike braided hair; and others maintain that it is circular. The Linga makes\nits eastern face of the colour of the ruby; its southern, that of the lotus;\nits western, golden; and its northern, coral. The Matsya has the same colours\nas the Vayu, and both contain this line: \'Four-coloured, golden, four-cornered\nlofty:\' but the Vayu compares its summit, in one place, to a saucer; and\nobserves that its circumference must be thrice its diameter. The Matsya also,\nrather incompatibly, says the measurement is that of a circular form, but it\nis considered quadrangular. According to the Buddhists of Ceylon, Meru is said\nto be of the same diameter throughout. Those of Nepal conceive it to be shaped\nlike a drum. A translation of the description of Meru and its surrounding\nmountains, contained in the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, which is the same exactly as that in\nthe Vayu, occurs in the As. Researches, VIII. 343. There are some differences\nin Col. Wilford\'s version from that which my MSS. would authorize, but they\nare not in general of much importance. Some, no doubt, depend upon variations\nin the readings of the different copies: of others, I must question the\naccuracy.\n\n[167:3](vp059.htm#fr_376) This diminution is the necessary consequence of the\ndiminished radius of the circle of Jambu-dwipa, as the mountain ranges recede\nfrom the centre.\n\n[168:4](vp059.htm#fr_377) These, being the two outer Varshas, are said to take\nthe form of a bow; that is, they are exteriorly convex, being segments of the\ncircle.\n\n[168:5](vp059.htm#fr_378) The whole diameter of Jambu-dwipa has been said to\nbe 100,000 Yojanas. This is thus divided from north to south: Ilavrita, in the\ncentre, extends each way 9000, making 18000: Meru itself; at the base, is\n16000: the six Varshas, at 9000 each, are equal to 54000: and the six ranges,\nat 2000 each, are 12000: and 18 + 16 + 54 + 12 = 100. From east to west the\nVarshas are of the extent necessary to occupy the space of the circle.\n\n[168:6](vp059.htm#fr_379) The Bhagavata and Padma call these Mandara,\nMerumandara, Supar\xc5\x9bwa, and Kumuda.\n\n[168:7](vp059.htm#fr_380) Nauclea Kadamba, Eugenia Jambu, Ficus religiosa, and\nF. Indica. The Bhagavata substitutes a mango-tree for the Pipal; placing it on\nMandara, the Jambu on Merumandara, the Kadamba on Supar\xc5\x9bwa, and the Vat\xcc\x81a on\nKumuda.\n\n[169:8](vp059.htm#fr_381) The Bhagavata substitutes Sarvatobhadra for the\nGandhamadana forest; and calls the lakes, lakes of milk, honey, treacle, and\nsweet water.\n\n[169:9](vp059.htm#fr_382) The Vayu gives these names, and many more; and\ndescribes at great length forests, lakes, and cities of gods and demigods upon\nthese fabulous mountains, or in the valleys between them. (As. Res. VIII.\n354.)\n\n[169:10](vp059.htm#fr_383) The Lokapalas, or eight deities in that character,\nIndra, Yama, Varun\xcc\x81a, Kuvera, Vivaswat, Soma, Agni, and Vayu. Other cities of\nthe gods are placed upon the spurs, or filament mountains, by the Vayu; or\nthat of Brahma on Hema\xc5\x9bringa, of \xc5\x9aankara on Kalanjara, of Garud\xcc\x81a on Vaikanka,\nand of Kuvera on Kailasa. Himavat is also specified by the same work as the\nscene of \xc5\x9aiva\'s penance, and marriage with Uma; of his assuming the form of a\nKirata, or forester: of the birth of Kartikeya, in the \xc5\x9aara forest; and of his\ndividing the mountain Krauncha with his spear. This latter legend, having been\nsomewhat misunderstood by Col. Wilford, is made the theme of one of his\nfanciful verifications. "Here, he (the author of the Vayu) says, in the forest\nof \xc5\x9aankha, was born Shad\xcc\x81anana or Kartikeya, Mars with six faces. Here he\nwished or formed the resolution of going to the mountains of Crauncha,\nGermany, part of Poland, &c. to rest and recreate himself after his fatigues\nin the wars of the gods with the giants. There, in the skirts of the mountains\np. 170 of Crauncha, he flung his sword; the very same which Attila, in the\nfifth century, asserted he had found under a clod of earth. It was placed in\nhis tomb, where it is probably to be found." As. Res. VIII. 364. The text of\nwhich this is in part a representation is, ###. The legend here alluded to is\ntold at length in the Vamana Puran\xcc\x81a. Mahishasura, flying from the battle, in\nwhich Taraka had been slain by Kartikeya, took refuge in a cave in the\nKrauncha mountain. A dispute arising between Kartikeya and Indra, as to their\nrespective prowess, they determined to decide the question by circumambulating\nthe mountain; the palm to be given to him who should first go round it.\nDisagreeing about the result, they appealed to the mountain, who untruly\ndecided in favour of Indra. Kartikeya, to punish his injustice, hurled his\nlance at the mountain Krauncha, and pierced at once it and the demon Mahisha.\nAnother division of Krauncha is ascribed to Para\xc5\x9burama. Megha Duta, v.59.\nKrauncha is also sometimes considered to be the name of an Asura, killed by\nKartikeya; but this is perhaps some misapprehension of the Pauran\xcc\x81ic legend by\nthe grammarians, springing out of the synonymes of Kartikeya, Kraunchari,\nKraunchadaran\xcc\x81a, &c., implying the foe or destroyer of Krauncha, occurring in\nthe Amara, and other Koshas.\n\n[170:11](vp059.htm#fr_384) The Bhagavata is more circumstantial. The river\nflowed over the great toe of Vishn\xcc\x81u\'s left foot, which had previously, as he\nlifted it up, made a fissure in the shell of the mundane egg, and thus gave\nentrance to the heavenly stream. The Vayu merely brings it from the lunar orb,\nand takes no notice of Vishn\xcc\x81u\'s interposition. In a different passage it\ndescribes the detention of Ganga amidst the tresses of \xc5\x9aiva, in order to\ncorrect her arrogance, until the divinity was moved by the penance and prayers\nof king Bhagiratha to set her free. The Mahabharata represents \xc5\x9aiva\'s bearing\nthe river for a hundred years on his head, merely to prevent its falling too\nsuddenly on the mountains.\n\n[171:12](vp059.htm#fr_385) Although the Vayu has this account, it subsequently\ninserts another, which is that also of the Matsya and Padma. In this the\nGanges, after escaping from \xc5\x9aiva, is said to have formed seven streams; the\nNalini, Hladini, and Pavani going to the east; the Chakshu, \xc5\x9aita, and Sindhu\nto the wrest; and the Bhagirathi to the south. The Mahabharata calls them\nVaswaukasara, Nalini, Pavani, Ganga, \xc5\x9aita, Sindhu, and Jambunadi. The more\nusual legend, however, is the first, and it offers some trace of actual\ngeography. Mr. Faber, indeed, thinks that Meru, with the surrounding Varsha of\nIlavrita, and its four rivers, is a representation of the garden of Eden.\n(Pagan Idolatry, I. 315.) However this may he, it seems not unlikely to have\noriginated in some imperfect account of four great rivers flowing from the\nHimalaya, and the high lands north of that range, towards the cardinal points:\nthe Bhadra, to the north, representing the Oby of Siberia; and the \xc5\x9aita, the\nriver of China, or Hoangho. The Alakananda is well known as a main branch of\nthe Ganges, near its source; and the Chakshus is very possibly, as Major\nWilford supposed, the Oxus. (As. Res. VIII. 309.) The printed copy of the\nBhagavata, and the MS. Padma, read Bankshu; but the former is the more usual\nreading. It is said, in the Vayu, of Ketumala, through which this river runs,\nthat it is peopled by various races of barbarians.\n\n[171:13](vp059.htm#fr_386) The text applies the latter name so variously as to\ncause confusion: it is given to one of the four buttresses of Meru, that on\nthe south; to one of the filament mountains, on the west; to a range of\nboundary mountains, on the south; and to the Varsha of Ketumala: here another\nmountain range is intended, or a chain running north and south, upon the east\nof Ilavrita, connecting the Nila and Nishadha ranges. Accordingly the Vayu\nstates it to be 34000 Yojanas in extent; that is, the diameter of Meru 16000,\nand the breadth of Ilavrita on each side of it, or together 18000. A similar\nrange, that of Malyavan, bounds Ilavrita on the west. It was probably to avoid\nthe confusion arising from similarity of. nomenclature, that the author of the\nBhagavata substituted different names for Gandhamadana in the other instances,\ncalling the buttress, as we have seen, Merumandara; the southern forest,\nSarvatobhadra; and the filament mountain, Hansa; restricting the term\nGandhamadana to the eastern range: a correction, it may be remarked,\ncorroborative of a subsequent date.\n\n[172:14](vp059.htm#fr_387) These eight mountains are similarly enumerated in\nthe Bhagavata and Vayu, but no mention is made in them of any seas, and it is\nclear that the eastern and western oceans cannot be intended, as the mountains\nMalyavat and Gandhamadana intervene. The commentator would seem to understand\n\'Arn\xcc\x81ava\' as signifying \'mountain,\' as he says between the seas means within\nMalyavat and Gandhamadana; The Bhagavata describes these eight mountains as\ncircling Meru for 18000 Yojanas in each direction, leaving, according to the\ncommentator, an interval of a thousand Yojanas between them and the base of\nthe central mountain, and being 2000 high, and as many broad: they may be\nunderstood to be the exterior barriers of Meru, separating it from Ilavritta.\nThe names of these mountains, according to the Bhagavata, are Jat\xcc\x81hara and\nDevakut\xcc\x81a on the east, Pavana and Paripatra on the west, Tri\xc5\x9bringa and Makara\non the north, and Kailasa and Karavira on the south. Without believing it\npossible to verify the position of these different creations of the legendary\ngeography of the Hindus, it can scarcely admit of doubt that the scheme was\nsuggested by imperfect acquaintance with the actual character of the country,\nby the four great ranges, the Altai, Muztag or Thian-shan, Ku-en-nun, and\nHimalaya, which traverse central Asia in a direction from east to west, with a\ngreater or less inclination from north to south, which are connected or\ndivided by many lofty transverse ridges, which enclose several large lakes,\nand which give rise to the great rivers that water Siberia, China, Tartary,\nand Hindustan. (Humboldt on the mountains of Central Asia, and Ritter. Geogr.\nAsia.)\n\n[173:15](vp059.htm#fr_388) More ample details of the Varshas are given in the\nMahabharata, Bhagavata, Padma, Vayu, Kurma, Linga, Matsya, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya\nPuran\xcc\x81as; but they are of an entirely fanciful nature. Thus of the Ketumala-\nvarsha it is said, in the Vayu, the men are black, the women of the complexion\nof the lotus; the people subsist upon the fruit of the Panasa or jack-tree,\nand live for ten thousand years, exempt from sorrow or sickness: seven Kula or\nmain ranges of mountains in it are named, and a long list of countries and\nrivers is added, none of which can be identified with any actually existing,\nexcept perhaps the greats river the Suchakshus, the Amu or Oxus. According to\nthe Bhagavata, Vishn\xcc\x81u is worshipped as Kamadeva in Ketumala. The Vayu says\nthe object of adoration there is \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara, the son of Brahma. Similar\ncircumstances are asserted of the other Varshas. See also As. Res. VIII. 352.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III](vp060.htm)\n\n'
