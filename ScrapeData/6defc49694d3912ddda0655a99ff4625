And on account of the text referring only to what is characterised by\npleasure.\n\nThe Person abiding within the eye is the highest Person, for the following\nreason also. The topic of the whole section is Brahman characterised by\ndelight, as indicated in the passage 'Ka(pleasure) is Brahman, Kha(ether) is\nBrahman' ( _Kh_. Up. IV,10, 5). To that same Brahman the passage under\ndiscussion ('The Person that is seen in the eye') refers for the purpose of\nenjoining first a place with which Brahman is to be connected in meditation,\nand secondly some special qualities--such as comprising and leading all\nblessings--to be attributed to Brahman in meditation.--The word 'only' in the\nSutra indicates the independence of the argument set forth.\n\nBut--an objection is raised--between the Brahman introduced in the passage 'Ka\nis Brahman,'&c.,and the text under discussion there intervenes the vidya of\nthe Fires ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 11-13), and hence Brahman does not readily connect\nitself with our passage. For the text says that after the Fires had taught\nUpakosala the knowledge of Brahman ('Breath is Brahman, Ka is Brahman,' &c.),\nthey taught him a meditation on themselves ('After that the (Garhapatya fire\ntaught him,' &c., _Kh_. Up. IV, 11, 1). And this knowledge of the Fires cannot\nbe considered a mere subordinate part of the knowledge of Brahman, for the\ntext declares that it has special fruits of its own--viz. the attainment of a\nripe old age and prosperous descendants,\n\np. 274\n\n[paragraph continues] &c.--which are not comprised in the results of the\nknowledge of Brahman, but rather opposed to them in nature.--To this we make\nthe following reply. As both passages (viz. IV, 10, 5, 'Breath is Brahman,'\n&c.; and IV, 15, 1, 'this is Brahman') contain the word Brahman, and as from\nthe words of the Fires, 'the teacher will tell you the way,' it follows that\nthe knowledge of Brahman is not complete before that way has been taught, we\ndetermine that the knowledge of the Fires which stands between the two\nsections of the knowledge of Brahman is a mere subordinate member of the\nlatter. This also appears from the fact that the Garhapatya fire begins to\ninstruct Upako _s_ ala only after he has been introduced into the knowledge of\nBrahman. Upako _s_ ala moreover complains that he is full of sorrows (I, 10,\n3), and thus shows himself to be conscious of all the sufferings incidental to\nhuman life-birth, old age, death, &c.--which result from man being troubled by\nmanifold desires for objects other than the attainment of Brahman; when\ntherefore the Fires conclude their instruction by combining in saying, 'This,\nO friend, is the knowledge of us and the knowledge of the Self which we impart\nto thee,' it is evident that the vidya of the Fires has to be taken as a\nsubordinate member of the knowledge of the Self whose only fruit is Release.\nAnd from this it follows that the statement of the results of the Agnividya\nhas to be taken (not as an injunction of results-phalavidhi--but) merely as an\narthavada (cp. Pu. Mi. Su. IV, 3, 1). It, moreover, is by no means true that\nthe text mentions such fruits of the Agnividya as would be opposed to final\nRelease; all the fruits mentioned suit very well the case of a person\nqualified for Release. 'He destroys sin' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 11, 2; 12, 2; 13, 2),\ni.e. he destroys all evil works standing in the way of the attainment of\nBrahman. 'He obtains the world,' i. e. all impeding evil works having been\ndestroyed he obtains the world of Brahman. 'He reaches his full age,' i.e. he\nfully reaches that age which is required for the completion of meditation on\nBrahman. 'He lives long,' i.e. he lives unassailed by afflictions until he\nreaches Brahman. 'His descendants do not perish,'\n\np. 275\n\ni.e. his pupils, and their pupils, as well as his sons, grandsons, &c., do not\nperish; i.e. they are all knowers of Brahman, in agreement with what another\ntext declares to be the reward of knowledge of Brahman--'In his family no one\nis born ignorant of Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9). 'We guard him in this world\nand the other,' i.e. we Fires guard him from all troubles until he reaches\nBrahman.--The Agnividya thus being a member of the Brahmavidya, there is no\nreason why the Brahman introduced in the earlier part of the Brahmavidya\nshould not be connected with the latter part--the function of this latter part\nbeing to enjoin a place of meditation (Brahman being meditated on as the\nPerson within the eye), and some special qualities of Brahman to be included\nin the meditation.--But (an objection is raised) as the Fires tell Upako _s_\nala 'the teacher will tell you the way,' we conclude that the teacher has to\ngive information as to the way to Brahman only; how then can his teaching\nrefer to the place of meditation and the special qualities of Brahman?--We\nhave to consider, we reply, in what connexion the Fires address those words to\nUpako _s_ ala. His teacher having gone on a journey without having imparted to\nhim the knowledge of Brahman, and Upako _s_ ala being dejected on that\naccount, the sacred fires of his teacher, well pleased with the way in which\nUpako _s_ ala had tended them, and wishing to cheer him up, impart to him the\ngeneral knowledge of the nature of Brahman and the subsidiary knowledge of the\nFires. But remembering that, as scripture says, 'the knowledge acquired from a\nteacher is best,' and hence considering it advisable that the teacher himself\nshould instruct Upako _s_ ala as to the attributes of the highest Brahman, the\nplace with which it is to be connected in meditation and the way leading to\nit, they tell him 'the teacher will tell you the way,' the 'way' connoting\neverything that remains to be taught by the teacher. In agreement herewith the\nteacher--having first said, 'I will tell you this; and as water does not cling\nto a lotus leaf, so no evil clings to one who knows it'--instructs him about\nBrahman as possessing certain\n\np. 276\n\nauspicious attributes, and to be meditated upon as abiding within the eye, and\nabout the way leading to Brahman.--It is thus a settled conclusion that the\ntext under discussion refers to that Brahman which was introduced in the\npassage 'Ka is Brahman,' and that hence the Person abiding within the eye is\nthe highest Self.\n\nBut--an objection is raised--how do you know that the passage 'Ka (pleasure)\nis Brahman, Kha (ether) is Brahman' really refers to the highest Brahman, so\nas to be able to interpret on that basis the text about the Person within the\neye? It is a more obvious interpretation to take the passage about Ka and Kha\nas enjoining a meditation on Brahman viewed under the form of elemental ether\nand of ordinary worldly pleasure. This interpretation would, moreover, be in\nagreement with other similarly worded texts (which are generally understood to\nenjoin meditation on Brahman in a definite form), such as 'Name is Brahman',\n'Mind is Brahman.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 16.
