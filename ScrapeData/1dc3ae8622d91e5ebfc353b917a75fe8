Thus the sutikagni is to be kept through one year.\nAfter the lapse of that year one should sacrifice every month on the domestic\nfire as long as his life lasts. As it is said "in the domestic fire," the\nsutikagni is not to be kept any longer.\' Naraya _n_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 26](sbe29028.htm)\n\n'
