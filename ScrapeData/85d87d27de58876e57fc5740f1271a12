III, 10, 4.\n\n[61:2](sbe15041.htm#fr_227) In giving the various degrees of happiness, the\nauthor of the Upanishad gives us at the same time the various classes of human\nand divine beings which we must suppose were recognised in his time. We have\nMen, human Gandharvas, divine Gandharvas, Fathers (pitara _s_ _k_ iralokaloka\n_h_ ), born Gods (agana _g_ a deva _h_ ), Gods by merit (karmadeva _h_ ),\nGods, Indra, B _ri_ haspati, Pra _g_ apati, Brahman. Such a list would seem to\nbe the invention of an individual rather than the result of an old tradition,\nif it did not occur in a very similar form in the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a,\nMadhyandina- _s_ akha XIV, 7, 1 ,31, Ka _n_ va- _s_ akha (B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. Up.\nIV, 3, 32). Here, too, the highest measure of happiness is ascribed to the\nBrahmaloka, and other beings are supposed to share a certain measure only of\nits supreme happiness. The scale begins in the Madhyandina- _s_ akha with men,\nwho are followed by the Fathers (pitaro _g_ italoka _h_ ), the Gods by merit\n(karmadeva _h_ ), the Gods by birth (aganadeva _h_ , with whom the _S_ rotriya\nis joined), the world of Gods, the world of Gandharvas, the world of Pra _g_\napati, the world of Brahman. In the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka-upanishad we have\nMen, Fathers, Gandharvas, Gods by merit, Gods by birth, Pra _g_ apati, and\nBrahman. If we place the three lists side by side, we find--\n\nTAITTIR\xc3\x8eYA-UPAN.\n\n|\n\n_S_ ATAPATHA-BR\xc3\x82H.\n\n|\n\nB _RI_ HAD\xc3\x82RAN.-UPAN.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nMen\n\n|\n\nMen\n\n|\n\nMen  \n  \nHuman Gandharvas  \n(and _S_ rotriya)\n\n|\n\n\\----\n\n|\n\n\\----  \n  \nDivine Gandharvas\n\n|\n\n\\----\n\n|\n\n\\----  \n  \nFathers ( _k_ iraloka)\n\n|\n\nFathers ( _g_ italoka)\n\n|\n\nFathers ( _g_ italoka)  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n\\----\n\n|\n\nGandharvas  \n  \nGods by birth\n\n|\n\nGods by merit\n\n|\n\nGods by merit  \n  \nGods by merit\n\n|\n\nGods by birth  \n(and _S_ rotriya)\n\n|\n\nGods by birth  \n(and _S_ rotriya)  \n  \nGods\n\n|\n\nGods\n\n|\n\n\\----  \n  \nIndra\n\n|\n\nGandharvas\n\n|\n\n\\----  \n  \nB _ri_ haspati\n\n|\n\n\\----\n\n|\n\n\\----  \n  \nPra _g_ apati\n\n|\n\nPra _g_ apati\n\n|\n\nPra _g_ apati  \n  \nBrahman\n\n|\n\nBrahman\n\n|\n\nBrahman.  \n  \n\n\nThe commentators do not help us much. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara on the Taittiriyaka-upanishad\np. 62 explains the human Gandharvas as men who have become Gandharvas, a kind\nof fairies; divine Gandharvas, as Gandharvas by birth. The Fathers or Manes\nare called Kiraloka, because they remain long, though not for ever, in their\nworld. The agana _g_ a Gods are explained as born in the world of the Devas\nthrough their good works (smarta), while the Karmadevas are explained as born\nthere through their sacred works (vaidika). The Gods are the thirty-three,\nwhose lord is Indra, and whose teacher B _ri_ haspati. Pra _g_ apati is Vira\n_g_ , Brahman Hira _n_ yagarbha. Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga, in his commentary on the _S_\natapatha-brahma _n_ a, explains the Fathers as those who, proceeding on the\nSouthern path, have conquered their world, more particularly by having\nthemselves offered in their life sacrifices to their Fathers. The Karmadevas,\naccording to him, are those who have become Devas by sacred works ( _s_\nrauta), the \xc3\x82ganadevas those who were gods before there were men. The Gods are\nIndra and the rest, while the Gandharvas are not explained. Pra _g_ apati is\nVira _g_ , Brahman is Hira _n_ yagarbha. Lastly, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, in his commentary\non the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yakaupanishad, gives nearly the same explanation as\nbefore; only that he makes aganadeva _h_ still clearer, by explaining them as\ngods aganata _h_ , i.e. utpattita _h_ , from their birth.\n\nThe arrangement of these beings and their worlds, one rising above the other,\nreminds us of the cosmography of the Buddhists, but the elements, though in a\nless systematic form, existed evidently before. Thus we find in the so-called\nGargi-brahma _n_ a (Satapatha-brahma _n_ a XIV, 6, 6, 1) the following\nsuccession: Water, air, ether a, the worlds of the sky b, heaven, sun, moon,\nstars, gods, Gandharvas c, Pra _g_ apati, Brahman. In the Kaushitaki-upanishad\nI, 3 (Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 275) there is another series, the\nworlds of Agni, Vayu, Varu _n_ a, Indra, Pra _g_ apati, and Brahman. See\nWeber, Ind. Stud. II, p. 224.\n\n[61:a](sbe15041.htm#fr_228) Deest in Kanva- _s_ akha.\n\n[61:b](sbe15041.htm#fr_229) Between sky and sun, the Ka _n_ va- _s_ akha\nplaces the Gandharvaloka (B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. Up. III, 6, 1, p. 609).\n\n[61:c](sbe15041.htm#fr_230) Instead of Gandharvas, the B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. Up.\nplaces Indra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 9](sbe15042.htm)\n\n"
