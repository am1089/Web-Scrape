Having smoothed (the sand) down with the two verses containing (the\nverb) 'to grow,' and returned (to the hall) he proceeds with the guest\noffering. Having performed the guest offering, he proceeds with the Pravargya\nand the Upasad 2. Having performed the Pravargya and the Upasad, they appease\nthat (first) layer on the (red ox-)skin. And as to why on a skin: for the\nobtainment of the forms, the skin being outward form;--on the hairy side: for\nthe obtainment of the forms, hair being outward form;--on a ruddy (skin): for\nthe obtainment of all forms, all forms (colours being contained) in the\nruddy;--on (the skin) of an ox: for the obtainment of Agni's forms, the ox\nbeing the same as Agni;--on (the skin spread) with the neck towards the east,\nfor that (tends) godward.\n\np. 356\n\n7:3:2:22\\. He spreads it in front of the Garhapatya, on the Vedi, with the\nhairy side upwards, and the neck towards the east: thereon they appease that\nlayer. Now he sprinkles (the bricks);--when he sprinkles, he thereby makes it\npure, sacrificially clean;--with clarified butter (he sprinkles), for that is\npure, sacrificially clean; and also with the view of its being unsurpassed 1,\nfor no other sacrificial food is sprinkled with ghee;--silently (he\nsprinkles), for what is (done) silently is undefined, and the undefined is\neverything: by means of everything he thus makes it pure, and sacrificially\nclean; and also with the view of its being unsurpassed, for no other\nsacrificial food is sprinkled silently.\n\n7:3:2:33\\. And, again, why he sprinkles,--this (layer of bricks) is\nsacrificial food, and as such he bastes it 2; for whatever sacrificial food is\nbuttered, and basted, that is palatable and sacrificially clean. With ghee (he\nbastes it), for sacrificial food is basted with ghee; silently (he does so),\nfor silently sacrificial food is basted;--by means of stalks of Ku _s_ a\ngrass, for these are pure, and sacrificially clean;--by means of the tops, for\nthe top is sacred to the gods.\n\n7:3:2:44\\. As to this they say, 'When he sprinkles only the first layer, how\ndoes that whole fire-altar of his come to be sprinkled, how does it come to be\nled forward on the skin, and how led forward by the horse 3?' Inasmuch as in\nthis (layer) he (symbolically) 4 sprinkles the bricks of all the layers; and\n\np. 357\n\nthus indeed that whole fire-altar of his comes to be sprinkled, and led\nforward on the skin, and led forward by the horse. They lift up this (first)\nlayer 1.\n\n7:3:2:55\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then says (to the Hot _ri_ ), 'Recite to the\nfires being led forward!' For at that time when the gods were setting out to\nspread the sacrifice, the Rakshas, the fiends, sought to smite them, saying,\n'Ye shall not sacrifice! ye shall not spread the sacrifice!!' Having made\nthose fires, those bricks, to be sharp-edged thunderbolts, they hurled these\nat them, and laid them low thereby; and having laid them low, they spread that\nsacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.\n\n7:3:2:66\\. Now, what the gods did is done here,--even now those Rakshas are\nindeed smitten by the gods themselves; and when he nevertheless does this, it\nis because he thinks, 'I must do what the gods did.' And so, having made those\nfires, those bricks, to be sharp-edged thunderbolts, he hurls them at whatever\nRakshas, whatever evildoers there may be, and lays them low thereby; and\nhaving laid them low, he spreads the sacrifice in a place free from danger and\ndevilry.\n\n7:3:2:77\\. And as to why (he recites) to the fires,--it is because there are\nhere many fires, to wit, those layers; and as to (his reciting) to them being\nled forward (pra-har), it is because he hurls (pra-har) them forward (as\nthunderbolts).\n\np. 358\n\n7:3:2:88\\. Now some recite (Va _g_. S. XII, 50), 'The Agnis Purishyas,\ntogether with those of the streams,'--a form of starting 1. Let him not do so;\nlet him recite gayatri verses addressed to Agni, and relating to (objects of)\ndesire: (Va _g_. S. XII, 115; _Ri_ k S. VIII, II, 7), 'Hither may Vatsa lead\nthy mind even from the highest seat, O Agni, with the song desirous of\nthee!'--(Va _g_. S. XII, 116; _Ri_ k S. VIII, 43,18), 'To thee, O Agni, best\nof A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, all good homesteads have laid themselves out for (the obtainment\nof) their desire.'--(Va _g_. S. XII, 117), 'Agni, the one all-ruler, shineth\nin the beloved homes, the (object of) desire of all that is and shall be.'\n\n7:3:2:99\\. Verses addressed to Agni he recites for the obtainment of Agni's\nforms;--and such as relate to desire, for the obtainment of his\ndesires;--Gayatri ones,--Agni is Gayatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much he thus pours him forth as seed;--with three\n(verses),--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,\nwith so much he thus pours him forth as seed. These (three), with the (first\nand last verses) recited thrice, amount to seven,--of seven layers consists\nthe fire-altar 2, seven seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. He recites in\na low voice, for here in the sacrifice seed is (cast), and seed is cast\nsilently. He (the Hot _ri_ ) marches reciting behind (the bricks carried by\nthe attendants); he thus marches, defending the sacrifice by the metres from\nbehind.\n\np. 359\n\n7:3:2:1010\\. And in front they lead a white horse. For at that time the gods\nwere afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should smite them here. They saw\nthat thunderbolt, even yonder sun; for that horse is yonder sun: having driven\noff the Rakshas, the fiends, in front, by that thunderbolt, they obtained\nwell-being in a place free from danger and devilry. They arrive at the (site\nof) the fire-altar; south of the tail (of the altar) they set down the layer\n(of bricks); from the north they make the horse step (on the site of the\naltar).\n\n7:3:2:1111\\. They lead it eastward on the left (north) side of the altar,\ninside the enclosing-stones, whereby they ward off evil from the eastern\nregion; then southward, whereby they ward off evil from the south; then\nwestward, whereby they ward off evil from the western region; then northward,\nwhereby they ward off evil from the northern region. Having thus warded off\nthe Rakshas, the fiends, from all the regions, he sets it (the horse) free\ntowards northeast: the significance of this has been explained.\n\n7:3:2:1212\\. Whilst it goes westward he makes it smell (kiss) that layer (of\nbricks);--that horse is yonder sun, and those bricks are the same as all these\ncreatures (on earth): thus even as he makes (the horse) smell, so yon sun\nkisses these creatures 1. And hence, by Pra _g_ apati's power, every one now\nthinks, 'I am!' And as to why he makes it smell while going westward, it is\nbecause, whilst going (from east) to west, that (sun) kisses all these\ncreatures.\n\np. 360\n\n7:3:2:1313\\. And, again, why he makes it smell;--that horse is yonder sun, and\nthose naturally-perforated (bricks) are these worlds; and even as he makes it\nsmell, so yonder sun strings these worlds to himself on a thread 1. And as to\nthat thread, the significance of that (will be explained) further on.\n\n7:3:2:1414\\. And, again, why he makes it smell; Agni went away from the gods;\nhe entered the water. The gods said to Pra _g_ apati, 'Go thou in search of\nhim: to thee, his own father, he will reveal himself.' He became a white\nhorse, and went in search of him. He found him on a lotus leaf, having crept\nforth from the water. He eyed him, and he (Agni) scorched him: hence the white\nhorse has, as it were, a scorched mouth 2, and indeed is apt to become weak-\neyed. He (Agni) thought he had hit and hurt him, and said to him, 'I grant\nthee a boon!'\n\n7:3:2:1515\\. He (Pra _g_ apati) said, 'Whoever shall seek thee in that form\n(of a white horse), shall find thee!' And, accordingly, he who seeks him\n(Agni) in that form, finds him; and having found him, he then builds him up.\n\n7:3:2:1616\\. It should be a white (horse), for that is a form of him (the sun)\nwho burns yonder. If he cannot obtain a white one, one that is not white might\ndo; but a horse it should be. If he cannot obtain a horse, even an ox might\ndo, for the ox is of Agni's nature, and Agni is the repeller of all evils.\n\np. 361\n\n7:3:2:1717\\. Now, then, as to the mounting 1 (of the altar). Now some mount it\nfrom the front (east) towards the back, or from the back towards the front:\nlet him not do so; for that Agni (the fire-altar) is an animal; and if one\nmounts an animal (ox) from the front towards the back, it strikes him with its\nhorns; and if he mounts it from the back towards the front, it does so with\nits feet. Let him mount it only by the middle body 2; for the animal which\npeople mount by the (middle) body, carries them forward, and does not hurt\nthem. From the left (north) side (he should mount it), for any animal which\npeople mount they mount from the left side. By mounting the (body of the)\naltar from the left side, and performing the work connected with the Uttara-\nvedi, he takes hold of Agni in the (middle) body (or, into himself); and\nhaving taken Agni into his own self, he sings the 'true hymn.' He puts a\nlotus-leaf on (the altar): thereof further on.\n\n7:3:2:1818\\. Now that horse they lead about when evening is closing in; for at\nthat time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should there\nsmite that (Agni, or altar) of theirs. They made that thunderbolt, to wit,\nyonder sun, his protector, for that horse is yonder sun; and in like manner\ndoes this one now make that thunderbolt his (Agni's) protector.\n\n7:3:2:1919\\. He leads it about towards the setting of the sun; for he (the\nsun) is manifestly his protector by day; and the Rakshas are the associates of\nthe\n\np. 362\n\nnight: for the night he thus makes that thunderbolt his protector. He leads it\nabout on every side: on every side he thus makes that thunderbolt his\nprotector. Thrice he leads it about: he thus makes that thunderbolt his\n(Agni's) threefold protector. He then lets it loose towards north-west: the\npurport of this has been explained. It afterwards returns (to the sacrificial\nground): the purport of this (will be explained) further on.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[355:2](sbe4162.htm#fr_667) See part ii, p. 104.\n\n[356:1](sbe4162.htm#fr_668) Literally, for not surmounting.\n\n[356:2](sbe4162.htm#fr_669) See part i, p. 192, note 1.\n\n[356:3](sbe4162.htm#fr_670) On the leading forward of the fire, and laying it\ndown on the foot-print of a horse, see II, 1, 4, 23 seq.\n\n[356:4](sbe4162.htm#fr_671) According to Katy.

Regarding this Thread, or spiritual\nbond, holding together all sentient existences of the universe, see XIV, 6, 7,\n2 seq.\n\n[360:2](sbe4162.htm#fr_677) That is, according to Saya _n_ a, a reddish mouth.\n\n[361:1](sbe4162.htm#fr_678) That is, as to the way in which the priests and\nsacrificer are to step on the body of the altar-site, when coming from\noutside.\n\n[361:2](sbe4162.htm#fr_679) That is to say, from sideways as in getting on the\nsaddle of a horse.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 4, 1.
