Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1899], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 264\n\n### BOOK THE THIRTY-SECOND.\n\nAGNI is That; the Sun is That; Vayu and Chandramas are  \nThat.  \nThe Bright is That; Brahma is That, those Waters, that  \nPrajapati.  \n2 All twinklings of the eyelid sprang from Purusha,  \nresplendent One.  \nNo one hath comprehended him above, across, or in the  \nmidst.  \n3 There is no counterpart of him whose glory verily is great.  \nIn the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, etc. Let not him  \nharm me, etc. Than whom there is no other born, etc.  \n4 This very God pervadeth all the regions; yea, born aforetime,  \nin the womb he dwelleth.  \nHe verily born and to be born hereafter meeteth his offspring,  \nfacing all directions.  \n5 Before whom naught whatever sprang to being; who with  \nhis presence aids all living creatures,  \nPrajapati, rejoicing in his offspring, he, Shodasi, maintains  \nthe Three great Lustres.  \n6 By whom the heavens are strong and earth stands firmly,  \nby whom light's realm and sky-vault are supported;  \nBy whom the regions in mid-air were measured. What  \nGod shall we adore with our oblation?\n\np. 265\n\n7 To whom, supported by his help, two armies embattled look  \nwhile trembling in their spirit,  \nWhere over them the risen Sun is shining. What God shall  \nwe adore with our oblation?  \nWhat time the mighty waters, etc. He in his might surveyed, etc.  \n8 The Sage beholdeth That mysterious Being wherein this  \nAll hath found one only dwelling.  \nTherein unites the Whole, and thence it issues: far-spread it  \nis the warp and woof in creatures.  \n9 Knowing Eternity, may the Gandharva declare that station,  \nparted, kept in secret.  \nThree steps thereof in mystery are hidden: he who knows  \nthese shall be the father's father.  \n10 He is our kin, our Father and Begetter: he knows all beings  \nand all Ordinances,  \nIn whom the Gods obtaining life eternal have risen upward  \nto the third high station.  \n11 Having encompassed round existing creatures, the world;  \nand all the Quarters and Mid-quarters,  \nHaving [approached](errata.htm#15) the first-born Child of Order he with his  \nSelf into The Self hath entered.\n\np. 266\n\n12 Having gone swiftly round the earth and heaven, around  \nthe worlds, around the sky, the Quarters,  \nHaving spread out the lengthened thread of Order, he views,  \nand he becomes and is That Being.  \n13 To the Assembly's wondrous Lord, to Indra's lovely Friend  \nwho gives  \nWisdom. have I drawn near in prayer.  \n14 That wisdom which the Companies of Gods, and Fathers,  \nrecognize,  \nEven with that intelligence, O Agni, make me wise to-day.  \nAll-hail!  \n15 Varuna grant me wisdom! grant it Agni and Prajapati!  \nWisdom may Indra, Vayu grant. May the Creator grant it  \nme. All-hail!  \n16 Let these the Priests and Nobles both enjoy the splendour  \nthat is mine.  \nBest splendour may the Gods bestow on me. To thee, that  \nsplendour, hail!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XXXIII](wyvbk33.htm)\n\n"
