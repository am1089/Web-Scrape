Into (plants) animated by other souls, because the statement is as in the\nprevious cases.\n\nThe text declares that (he descending souls are born as rice, corn, &c., 'they\nare born here as rice, corn, herbs, trees,' &c. The question here is whether\nthe souls cling to plants animated by other souls which have those plants for\ntheir bodies; or whether the descending souls themselves are born with those\nplants for their bodies.--The latter view is the right one; for the text says,\n'they are born as rice, grain,' and so on, and this expression is of the same\nkind as when we say 'he is born as a man, as a deva,' and so on. The text\ntherefore means that the souls are embodied in the different plants.--This\nview the Sutra rejects. The souls merely cling to those plants which\nconstitute the bodies of other souls; 'since the statement is as in the\nprevious cases,' i.e. because the text only says that the souls become plants\nas it had previously been said that they become ether, and so on. Where the\ntext means to say that the soul enters on the condition of an enjoying soul\n(i.e. of a soul assuming a new body for the purpose of retributive enjoyment),\nit refers to the deeds which lead to such enjoyment; so e. g. in the passage,\n'Those whose works have been good obtain a good birth,' &c. But in the text\nunder discussion there is no such reference to karman. For those works--viz.\nsacrifices and the like--which were undertaken with a view to reward, such as\nenjoyment of the heavenly world, are, in the case of the descending souls,\ncompletely wiped out by the enjoyment of the heavenly world (which precedes\nthe descent of the souls); and those works on the other hand, the action of\nwhich has not yet begun, lead to the embodiments mentioned\n\np. 598\n\nfurther on ('Those whose works are good'). And in the interval between those\ntwo conditions no new karman originates. When, therefore, the text says that\nthe souls are born as plants, the statement cannot be taken in its literal\nsense.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 25. It is unholy.
