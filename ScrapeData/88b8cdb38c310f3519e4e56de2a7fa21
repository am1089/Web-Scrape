(The meditations are) separate, on account of the difference of words,\nand so on.\n\nThe instances coming under this head of discussion are all those meditations\non Brahman which have for their only result final Release, which consists in\nattaining to Brahman--such as the meditation on that which is, the meditation\non the bhuman, the meditation on the small space within the heart, the Upako\n_s_ ala meditation, the _S_ a _nd_ ilya meditation, the meditation on Vai _s_\nvanara, the meditation on the Self of bliss, the meditation on the\nImperishable, and others--whether they be recorded in one _s_ akha only or in\nseveral _s_ akhas. To a different category belong those meditations which have\na special object such as Pra _n_ a, and a special result.--The doubt here\narises whether the meditations of the former class are all to be considered as\nidentical, or as separate--The Purvapakshin holds that they are all one; for,\nhe says, they all have one and the same object of meditation, viz. Brahman.\nFor the nature of all cognition depends on the object cognised; and the nature\nof the meditations thus being one, the meditations themselves are one.--This\nview the Sutra controverts.\n\np. 680\n\n[paragraph continues] The meditations are different, on account of the\ndifference of terms and the rest. The 'and the rest' comprises repetition\n(abhyasa), number (sa _m_ khya), quality (gu _n_ a), subject-matter\n(prakriya), and name (namadheya; cp. Pu. Mi. Su. II, 2, 1 ff.). We meet in\nthose meditations with difference of connexion, expressing itself in\ndifference of words, and so on; which causes difference on the part of the\nmeditations enjoined. The terms enjoining meditation, 'he knows,' 'he is to\nmeditate' (veda; upasita), and so on, do indeed all of them denote a certain\ncontinuity of cognition, and all these cognitions have for their object\nBrahman only, but all the same those cognitions differ in so far as they have\nfor their object Brahman, as variously qualified by special characteristics\nmentioned in the meditation; in one meditation he is spoken of as the sole\ncause of the world, in another as free from all evil, and so on. We therefore\narrive at the decision that clauses which describe special forms of meditation\nhaving for their result the attainment to Brahman, and are complete in\nthemselves, convey the idea of separate independent meditations, and thus\neffect separation of the vidyas. This entire question was indeed already\ndecided in the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras (II, 2, 1), but it is here argued\nagain to the end of dispelling the mistaken notion that the Vedanta-texts aim\nat knowledge only, and not at the injunction of activities such as meditation.\nThe meditations, therefore, are separate ones.--Here terminates the adhikara\n_n_ a of 'difference of words and the rest.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 57.
