[1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n11:2:3\n\n### THIRD BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n11:2:3:11\\. Verily, in the beginning, this (universe) was the Brahman (neut.)\n2. It created the gods; and, having created the gods, it made them ascend\nthese worlds: Agni this (terrestrial) world, Vayu the air, and Surya the sky.\n\n11:2:3:22\\. And the deities who are above these he made ascend the worlds\nwhich are above these; and, indeed, just as these (three) worlds and these\n(three) deities are manifest, so are those (higher) worlds and those (higher)\ndeities manifest--(the worlds) which he made those deities ascend.\n\n11:2:3:33\\. Then the Brahman itself went up to the sphere beyond. Having gone\nup to the sphere beyond, it considered, 'How can I descend again into these\nworlds?' It then descended again by means of these two--Form and Name.\nWhatever has a name,\n\np. 28\n\nthat is name; and that again which has no name, and which one knows by its\nform, 'This is (of a certain) form,' that is form: as far as there are Form\nand Name so far, indeed, extends this (universe).\n\n11:2:3:44\\. These, indeed, are the two great forces of the Brahman; and,\nverily, he who knows these two great forces of the Brahman becomes himself a\ngreat force.\n\n11:2:3:55\\. These, indeed, are the two great manifestations 1 of the Brahman;\nand, verily, he who knows these two great manifestations of the Brahman\nbecomes himself a great manifestation. One of these two is the greater, namely\nForm; for whatever is Name, is indeed Form; and, verily, he who knows the\ngreater of these two, becomes greater than he whom he wishes to surpass in\ngreatness.\n\n11:2:3:66\\. In the beginning, indeed, the gods were mortal, and only when they\nhad become possessed 2 of the Brahman they were immortal. Now, when he makes\nthe libation to Mind 3\\--form being mind, inasmuch as it is by mind that one\nknows, 'This is form'--he thereby obtains Form; and when he makes the libation\nto Speech--name being speech, inasmuch as it is by speech that he seizes\n(mentions) the name--he thereby obtains Name;--as far as there are Form and\nName, so far, indeed, extends this whole (universe): all this he obtains; and\n--the\n\np. 29\n\nall being the imperishable--imperishable merit and the imperishable world thus\naccrue to him.\n\n11:2:3:77\\. There, on the occasion of the offering to Agni 1, it has been told\nhow the sacrifice then pleased the _Ri_ shis, and how they performed it. Now,\nwhen the _Ri_ shis were performing the sacrifice, the Gandharvas came nigh to\nthem. They looked on, thinking, 'Here, surely, they have done too much,--here\nthey have done too little.' And when their sacrifice was completed, they\npointed it out to them, saying, 'Here, surely, ye have done too much,--here ye\nhave done too little.'\n\n11:2:3:88\\. Now, wherever they had done too much it was like a hill; and\nwherever they had done too little it was like a pit.\n\n11:2:3:99\\. Now, when he pronounces the _S_ amyos (all-hail and blessing), he\ntouches (the earth 2) with (Va _g_. S. II, 19), 'O Sacrifice, homage be unto\nthee: mayest thou complete thy course up to the success of the sacrifice and\nup to mine own right offering!' Wherever (in the course of the sacrifice) he\nhas committed any excess, he makes amends for it by doing homage; and wherever\nhe has left anything defective, it ceases to be defective by his saying, 'up\nto.' In saying, 'Mayest thou complete thy course up to the success of the\nsacrifice,'--success being whatever in the sacrifice is neither defective nor\nexcessive--he thereby makes amends for both of these (mistakes); and in\nsaying, 'Mayest thou complete thy\n\np. 30\n\ncourse up to mine own right offering,'--right offering being whatever in the\nsacrifice is neither defective nor excessive--he thereby also makes amends for\nboth of these (mistakes); and thus that sacrifice of his comes to be performed\nas one that is neither defective nor excessive by whosoever, knowing this,\nthus touches (the earth): let him therefore touch it just in this way. But,\nindeed, those Gandharvas were Yavaman (rich in barley), the winnowing-basket;\nUddalavan (rich in paspalum frumentaceum), husbandry; and Antarvan (the\npregnant), grain 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[27:2](sbe44013.htm#fr_136) On this speculative myth, see John Muir, Orig. S.\nTexts, vol. v, pp. 387-89.\n\n[28:1](sbe44013.htm#fr_137) Or, phantasmagories, illusive representations.\n\n[28:2](sbe44013.htm#fr_138) The use of 'ap' with the instrumental (brahma _n_\na apu _h_ ) is peculiar,--brahma _n_ a vyapta _h_ , Say.\n\n[28:3](sbe44013.htm#fr_139) The two libations (aghara) of ghee, forming the\nfirst oblations of an ish _t_ i, made on the newly kindled fire, are offered\nto Mind and Speech respectively; cf. part i, p. 224 seqq.\n\n[29:1](sbe44013.htm#fr_140) Saya _n_ a explains this by 'adhanakara _n_ e';\nbut the passage referred to occurs I, 6, 2, 3. 4, in connection with the first\nbutter-portion (a _g_ yabhaga), that of Agni.\n\n[29:2](sbe44013.htm#fr_141) Or, perhaps, the altar; see I, 9, 1, 29.\n\n[30:1](sbe44013.htm#fr_142) On these names, Saya _n_ a merely remarks,--te\ngandharva _h_ _s_ urpadibhavam apanna babhuvu _h_ , yavaman ityadyas tesha _m_\nsa _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_.--Mahidhara, on the other hand, on Va _g_. S. II, 19,\nmakes them to be five names, Yavamat, _S_ urpa (n.), Uddalavat, K _ri_ shi\n(f.), and Dhanantarvat. This is very improbable; the last name, especially,\nbeing accented on the first syllable, showing it to be two words.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 2, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe44014.htm)\n\n"
