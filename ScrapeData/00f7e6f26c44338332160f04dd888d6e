 \nThe Bel-trees see, so loved of men,  \nHanging their boughs in every glen.  \nO'erburthened with their fruit and flowers:  \nA plenteous store of food is ours.  \n   See, Lakshman, in the leafy trees,  \n     Where'er they make their home.  \n   Down hangs, the work of labouring bees  \n     The ponderous honeycomb.  \n   In the fair wood before us spread  \n     The startled wild-cock cries:  \n   Hark, where the flowers are soft to tread,  \n     The peacock's voice replies.  \n   Where elephants are roaming free,  \n     And sweet birds' songs are loud,  \n   The glorious Chitrakuta see:  \n     His peaks are in the cloud.  \n   On fair smooth ground he stands displayed,  \n     Begirt by many a tree:  \n   O brother, in that holy shade  \n     How happy shall we be!' 1  \n\nThen Rama, Lakshman, Sita, each  \nSpoke raising suppliant hands this speech  \nTo him, in woodland dwelling met,  \nValmiki, ancient anchoret:  \n'O Saint, this mountain takes the mind,  \nWith creepers, trees of every kind,  \nVith fruit and roots abounding thus,  \nA pleasant life it offers us:  \nHere for a while we fain would stay,  \nAnd pass a season blithe and gay.'  \n   Then the great saint, in duty trained,  \nWith honour gladly entertained:  \nHe gave his guests a welcome fair,  \nAnd bade them sit and rest them there,  \nRama of mighty arm and chest  \nHis faithful Lakshman then addressed:  \n'Brother, bring hither from the wood  \nSelected timber strong and good,  \nAnd build therewith a little cot;  \nMy heart rejoices in the spot  \nThat lies beneath the mountain's side,  \nRemote, with water well supplied.'  \nSumitra's son his words obeyed,  \nBrought many a tree, and deftly made,  \nWith branches in the forest cut,  \nAs Rama bade, a leafy hut.  \nThen Rama, when the cottage stood  \nFair, firmly built, and walled with wood,  \nTo Lakshman spake, whose eager mind  \nTo do his brother's will inclined:  \n'Now, Lakshman as our cot is made,  \nMust sacrifice be duly paid  \nBy us, for lengthened life who hope,  \nWith venison of the antelope.  \nAway, O bright-eyed Lakshman, speed:  \nStruck by thy bow a deer must bleed:  \nAs Scripture bids, we must not slight  \nThe duty that commands the rite.'  \n   Lakshman, the chief whose arrows laid  \nHis foemen low, his word obeyed;  \nAnd Rama thus again addressed  \nThe swift performer of his hest:  \n'Prepare the venison thou hast shot,  \nTo sacrifice for this our cot.  \nHaste, brother dear, for this the hour,  \nAnd this the day of certain power.'  \nThen glorious Lakshman took the buck  \nHis arrow in the wood had struck;  \nBearing his mighty load he came,  \nAnd laid it in the kindled flame.  \n\np. 162  \n\nSoon as he saw the meat was done,  \nAnd that the juices ceased to run  \nFrom the broiled carcass, Lakshman then  \nSpoke thus to Rama best of men:  \n'The carcass of the buck, entire,  \nIs ready dressed upon the fire.  \nNow be the sacred rites begun  \nTo please the God, thou godlike one.'  \n\nRama the good, in ritual trained,  \nPure from the bath, with thoughts restrained,  \nHasted those verses to repeat  \nWhich make the sacrifice complete.  \nThe hosts celestial came in view,  \nAnd Rama to the cot withdrew,  \nWhile a sweet sense of rapture stole  \nThrough the unequalled hero's soul.  \nHe paid the Vis'vedevas  [1](ry135.htm#fn_332) due.  \nAnd Rudra's right, and Vishnu's too,  \nNor wonted blessings, to protect  \nTheir new-built home, did he neglect.  \nWith voice repressed he breathed the prayer,  \nBathed duly in the river fair,  \nAnd gave good offerings that remove  \nThe stain of sin, as texts approve.  \nAnd many an altar there he made,  \nAnd shrines, to suit the holy shade,  \nAll decked with woodland chaplets sweet,  \nAnd fruit and roots and roasted meat,  \nWith muttered prayer, as texts require,  \nWater, and grass and wood and fire.  \nSo Rama, Lakshman, Sita paid  \nTheir offerings to each God and shade,  \nAnd entered then their pleasant cot  \nThat bore fair signs of happy lot.  \nThey entered, the illustrious three,  \nThe well-set cottage, fair to see,  \nRoofed with the leaves of many a tree,  \n   And fenced from wind and rain;  \nSo, at their Father Brahma's call,  \nThe Gods of heaven, assembling all,  \nTo their own glorious council hall  \n   Advance in shining train.  \nSo, resting on that lovely hill,  \nNear the fair lily-covered rill,  \n   The happy prince forgot,  \nSurrounded by the birds and deer,  \nThe woe, the longing, and the fear  \n   That gloom the exile's lot.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[161:1](ry134.htm#fr_331) 'We have often looked on that green hill: it is the\nholiest spot of that sect of the Hindu faith who devote themselves to this\nincarnation, of Vishnu. The whole neighbourhood is Rama's country. Every\nheadland has some legend, every cavern is connected with his name; some of the\nwild fruits are still called _St aphal_, being the reputed food of the exile.\nThousands and thousands annually visit the spot, and round the hill is a\nraised foot-path, on which the devotee, with naked feet, treads full of pious\nawe.' _Calcutta Review_ , Vol. XXIII.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LVII.: Sumantra's Return.](ry135.htm)\n\n"
