Then they live\nby food, and in the end they return to food. For food is the oldest of all\nbeings, and therefore it is called panacea (sarvaushadha, i.e. consisting of\nall herbs, or quieting the heat of the body of all beings).'\n\nThey who worship food as Brahman 3, obtain all food. For food is the oldest of\nall beings, and therefore it is called panacea. From food all creatures are\nproduced; by food, when born, they grow. Because it is fed on, or because it\nfeeds on beings, therefore it is called food (anna).\n\nDifferent from this, which consists of the essence of food, is the other, the\ninner Self, which consists of breath. The former is filled by this. It also\nhas the shape of man. Like the human shape of the former is the human shape of\nthe latter. Pra _n_ a (up-breathing) is its head. Vyana (back-breathing) is\nits right arm. Apana (down-breathing) is its left arm. Ether is its trunk. The\nearth the seat (the support).\n\nOn this there is also the following _S_ loka:\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[55:1](sbe15034.htm#fr_214) The text has 'the tail, which is his support.' But\npratish _th_ a seems to have been added, the Anuvaka ending originally with pu\n_k_ _kh_ a, which is explained by nabher adhastad yad a\xe1\xb9\x85gam. In the Persian\ntranslation the different members are taken for members of a bird, which is\nnot unlikely.\n\n[55:2](sbe15035.htm#fr_215) Anna is sometimes used in the more general sense\nof matter.\n\n[55:3](sbe15035.htm#fr_216) Worship consisting in the knowledge that they are\nborn of food, live by food, and end in food, which food is Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3](sbe15036.htm)\n\n"
