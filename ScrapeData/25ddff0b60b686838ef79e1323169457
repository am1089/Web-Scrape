X.\n\nDescription of autumn. Krishn\xcc\x81a dissuades Nanda from worshipping Indra:\nrecommends him and the Gopas to worship cattle and the mountains.\n\nWHILST Ke\xc5\x9bava and Rama were sporting thus in Vraja, the rainy season ended,\nand was succeeded by the season of autumn, when the lotus is full blown. The\nsmall Saphari fish, in their watery burrows, were oppressed by the heat, like\na man by selfish desires, who is devoted to his family. The peacocks, no\nlonger animated by passion, were silent amidst the woods, like holy saints,\nwho have come to know the unreality of the world. The clouds, of shining\nwhiteness, exhausted of their watery wealth, deserted the atmosphere, like\nthose who have acquired wisdom, and depart from their homes. Evaporated by the\nrays of the autumnal sun, the lakes were dried up, like the hearts of men when\nwithered by the contact of selfishness. The pellucid waters of the season were\nsuitably embellished by white water-lilies, as are the minds of the pure by\nthe apprehension of truth. Brightly in the starry sky shone the moon with\nundiminished orb, like the saintly being, who has reached the last stage of\nbodily existence, in the company of the pious. The rivers and lakes slowly\nretired from their banks, as the wise by degrees shrink from the selfish\nattachment that connects them with wife and child. First abandoned by the\nwaters of the lake, the swans again began to congregate, like false ascetics,\nwhose devotions are interrupted, and they are again assailed by innumerable\nafflictions. The ocean was still and calm, and exhibited no undulations, like\nthe perfect sage, who has completed his course of restraint, and has acquired\nundisturbed tranquillity of spirit. Every where the waters were as clear and\npure as the minds of the wise, who behold Vishn\xcc\x81u in all things. The autumnal\nsky was wholly free from clouds, like the heart of the ascetic, whose care\'s\nhave been consumed by the fire of devotion. The moon allayed the fervours of\nthe sun, as discrimination alleviates the pain to which egotism gives birth.\nThe clouds of the atmosphere, the muddiness of the earth, the discoloration of\nthe waters, were all removed by autumn, as abstraction detaches the senses\n\np. 523\n\nfrom the objects of perception. The exercise of inspiring, suppressing, and\nexpiring the vital air, was as if performed daily by the waters of the lakes\n(as they were full, and stationary, and then again declined) 1.\n\nAt this season, when the skies were bright with stars, Krishn\xcc\x81a, repairing to\nVraja, found all the cowherds busily engaged in preparing for a sacrifice to\nbe offered to Indra 2; and going to the elders, he asked them, as if out of\ncuriosity, what festival of Indra it was in which they took so much pleasure.\nNanda replied to his question, and said, "\xc5\x9aatakratu or Indra is the sovereign\nof the clouds and of the waters: sent by him, the former bestow moisture upon\nthe earth, whence springs the grain, by which we and all embodied beings\nsubsist; with which also, and with water, we please the gods: hence too these\ncows bear calves, and yield milk, and are happy, and well nourished. So when\nthe clouds are seen distended with rain, the earth is neither barren of corn,\nnor bare of verdure, nor is man distressed by hunger. Indra, the giver of\nwater, having drank the milk of earth by the solar ray, sheds it again upon\nthe earth for the sustenance of all the world. On this account all sovereign\nprinces offer with pleasure sacrifices to Indra at the end of the rains, and\nso also do we, and so do other people."\n\nWhen Krishn\xcc\x81a heard this speech from Nanda in regard to the worship of Indra,\nhe determined to put the king of the celestials into a\n\np. 524\n\npassion, and replied, "We, father, are neither cultivators of the soil, nor\ndealers in merchandise; we are sojourners in forests, and cows are our\ndivinities. There are four branches of knowledge, logical, scriptural,\npractical, and political 3. Hear me describe what practical science is.\nAgriculture, commerce, and tending of cattle; the knowledge of these three\nprofessions constitutes practical science. Agriculture is the subsistence of\nfarmers; buying and selling, of traders. Kine are our support. Thus the\nknowledge of means of support is threefold. The object that is cultivated by\nany one should be to him as his chief divinity; that should be venerated and\nworshipped, as it is his benefactor. He who worships the deity of another, and\ndiverts from him the reward that is his due, obtains not a prosperous station\neither in this world or in the next. Where the land ceases to be cultivated\nthere are bounds assigned, beyond which commences the forest; the forests are\nbounded by the hills, and so far do our limits extend. We are not shut in with\ndoors, nor confined within walls; we have neither fields nor houses; we wander\nabout happily wherever we list, travelling in our waggons 4. The spirits of\nthese mountains, it is said, walk the woods in whatever forms they will, or in\ntheir proper persons sport upon their own precipices. If they should be\ndispleased with those who inhabit the forests, then, transformed to lions and\nbeasts of prey, they will kill the offenders. We then are bound to worship the\nmountains; to offer sacrifices to cattle. What have we to do with Indra?\ncattle and mountains are our gods. Brahmans offer worship with prayer;\ncultivators of the earth adore their landmarks; but we who tend our herds in\nthe forests and mountains should worship them and our kine. Let prayer and\nofferings then be addressed\n\np. 525\n\nto the mountain Govarddhana, and kill a victim in due form. Let the whole\nstation collect their milk without delay, and feed with it the Brahmans and\nall who may desire to partake of it. When the oblations have been presented,\nand the Brahmans have been fed, let the Gopas circumambulate the cows,\ndecorated with garlands of autumnal flowers. If the cowherds will attend to\nthese suggestions, they will secure the favour of the mountain, of the cattle,\nand also mine."\n\nWhen Nanda and the other Gopas heard these words of Krishn\xcc\x81a, their faces\nexpanded with delight, and they said that he had spoken well. "You have judged\nrightly, child," exclaimed they; "we will do exactly as you have proposed, and\noffer adoration to the mountain." Accordingly the inhabitants of Vraja\nworshipped the mountain, presenting to it curds and milk and flesh; and they\nfed hundreds and thousands of Brahmans, and many other guests, who came to the\nceremony, even as Krishn\xcc\x81a had enjoined: and when they had made their\nofferings, they circumambulated the cows and the bulls, that bellowed as loud\nas roaring clouds. Upon the summit of Govarddhana, Krishn\xcc\x81a presented himself,\nsaying, "I am the mountain," and partook of much food presented by the Gopas;\nwhilst in his own form as Krishn\xcc\x81a he ascended the hill along with the\ncowherds, and worshipped his other self 5. Having promised them many\nblessings, the mountain-person of Krishn\xcc\x81a vanished; and the ceremony being\ncompleted, the cowherds returned to their station.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[523:1](vp127.htm#fr_1485) A set of very poor quibbles upon the terms of the\nPran\xcc\x81ayama: or, Puran\xcc\x81a, drawing in the breath through one nostril; literally,\n\'filling:\' Kumbhaka, closing the nostrils, and suppressing the breath; keeping\nit stationary or confined, as it were in a Kumbha, or waterpot: and Rechaka,\nopening the other nostril, and emitting the breath; literally, \'purging\' or\n\'depletion.\' The waters of the reservoirs, replenished in the beginning of the\nautumnal season by the previous rains, remain for a while full, until they are\ndrawn off for irrigation, or reduced by evaporation: thus representing the\nthree operations of Puran\xcc\x81a, Kumbhaka, and Rechaka.\n\n[523:2](vp127.htm#fr_1486) No public worship is offered to Indra at present;\nand the only festival in the Hindu kalendar, the \xc5\x9aakradhwajotthana, the\nerection of a flag in honour of \xc5\x9aakra or Indra, should be held on the twelfth\nor thirteenth of Bhadra, which is in the very middle of the rainy season;\naccording to the Tithi Tatwa, following the authority of the Kalika and\nBhavishyottara Puran\xcc\x81as. The \xc5\x9aakradhwajotthana is also a rite to be performed\nby kings and princes. It may be doubted, therefore, if the text intends any\nparticular or appointed celebration.\n\n[524:3](vp127.htm#fr_1487) Or, \xc3\x81nvikshiki, the science of inquiring by\nreasoning, Tarka, or logic: Trayi, the three Vedas collectively, or the\ndoctrines they teach: Vartta, rendered \'practical,\' is the knowledge of the\nmeans of acquiring subsistence: the fourth is Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81aniti, the science of\ngovernment, both domestic and foreign.\n\n[524:4](vp127.htm#fr_1488) These nomadic habits are entirely lost sight of in\nthe parallel passages of those Puran\xcc\x81as in which the juvenile life of Krishn\xcc\x81a\nis narrated. The text of the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba is in most of the other verses\nprecisely the same as that of the Vishn\xcc\x81u P., putting however into the mouth\nof Krishn\xcc\x81a a long additional eulogium on the season of autumn.\n\n[525:5](vp127.htm#fr_1489) The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba says, \'an illusory Krishn\xcc\x81a, having\nbecome the mountain, ate the flesh that was offered.\' Of course the\n\'personified\' mountain is intended, as appears from several of the ensuing\npassages; as for instance, he says presently, \'I am satisfied; and then in his\ndivine form he smiled.\' The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba affords here, as in so many other\nplaces, proofs of its Dakhini origin. It is very copious upon the homage paid\nto the cattle, and their decoration with garlands and plumes of peacocks\'\nfeathers, of which our text takes no notice. But in the south of India there\nis a very popular festival, that of the Punjal, scarcely known in the north,\nwhen cattle are decorated and worshipped; a celebration which has no doubt\nsuggested to the compiler of the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba the details which he describes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI](vp128.htm)\n\n'
