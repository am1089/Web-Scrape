Now (follow the rules regarding) legal proceedings.\n\n2\\. Let the king (or) his minister transact the business on the bench. 2\n\n3\\. When two (parties) have a dispute, let him not be partial to one of them.\n3\n\np. 79\n\n4\\. Let him reason properly regarding an offence; finally the offence (will\nbecome evident thereby). 4\n\n5\\. He who properly reasons regarding an offence, in accordance with the sum\nof the science of the first two castes, is equitable towards all created\nbeings. 5\n\n6\\. And let him protect what has been gained; 6\n\n7\\. (Likewise) the property of infants (of the) royal (race). 7\n\np. 80\n\n8\\. (Likewise the property) of persons unfit to transact legal business\n(minors, widows, and so forth). 8\n\n9\\. But if (a minor) comes of age, his property must be made over to him.\n\n10\\. 'It is declared in the Sm _ri_ ti that there are three kinds of proof\nwhich give a title to (property, viz.) documents, witnesses, and possession;\n(thereby) an owner may recover property which formerly belonged to him (but\nwas lost).' 10\n\n11\\. From fields through which (there is a right of) road (a space sufficient\nfor the road) must be set apart, likewise a space for turning (a cart). 11\n\n12\\. Near new-built houses (and) other things (of the same description there\nshall be) a passage three feet broad. 12\n\n13\\. In a dispute about a house or a field, reliance (may be placed on the\ndepositions of) neighbours. 13\n\n14\\. If the statements of the neighbours disagree, documents (may be taken as)\nproof.\n\np. 81\n\n15\\. If conflicting documents are produced, reliance (may be placed) on (the\nstatements of) aged (inhabitants) of the village or town, and on (those of)\nguilds and corporations (of artisans or traders). 15\n\n16\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Property inherited from a\nfather, a thing bought, a pledge, property given to a wife after marriage by\nher husband's family, a gift, property obtained for performing a sacrifice,\nthe property of reunited coparceners, and wages as the eighth.' 16\n\n17\\. Whatever belonging to these (eight kinds of property) has been enjoyed\n(by another person) for ten years continuously (is lost to the owner). 17\n\n18\\. They quote also (a verse) on the other side: 'A pledge, a boundary, and\nthe property of minor's, an (open) deposit, a sealed deposit, women, the\nproperty of a king, (and) the wealth of a _S_ rotriya are not lost by being\nenjoyed (by others).' 18\n\n19\\. Property entirely given up (by its owner) goes to the king. 19\n\n20\\. If it be otherwise, the king with his ministers and the citizens shall\nadminister it. 20\n\np. 82\n\n21\\. A king will be superior even to Brahman if he lives surrounded by\nservants (who are keen-eyed) like vultures.\n\n22\\. But a king will not be exalted if he lives surrounded by servants (who\nare greedy) like vultures.\n\n23\\. Let him live surrounded by servants (who are keen-eyed) like vultures,\nlet him not be a vulture surrounded by vultures.\n\n24\\. For through his servants blemishes become manifest (in his kingdom),\n\n25\\. (Such as) theft, robbery, oppression, and (so forth).\n\n26\\. Therefore let him question his servants before-hand.\n\n27\\. Now (follow the rules regarding) witnesses:\n\n28\\. _S_ rotriyas, men of unblemished form, of good character, men who are\nholy and love truth (are fit to be) witnesses, 28\n\n29\\. Or (men of) any (caste may give evidence) regarding (men of) any (other\ncaste). 29\n\n30\\. Let him make women witnesses regarding women; for twice-born men twice-\nborn men of the same caste (shall be witnesses), and good _S_ udras for _S_\nudras, and men of low birth for low-caste men. 30\n\n31\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'A son need not pay money due\nby a surety, any-thing idly promised, money due for losses at play or for\nspirituous liquor, nor what remains unpaid of a fine or a toll.' 31\n\n32\\. 'Depose, O witness, according to the truth; expecting thy answer, thy\nancestors hang in suspense;\n\np. 83\n\n[paragraph continues] (in accordance with its truth or falsehood) they will\nrise (to heaven) or fall (into hell).'\n\n33\\. 'Naked and shorn, tormented with hunger and thirst, and deprived of sight\nshall the man who gives false evidence go with a potsherd to beg food at the\ndoor of his enemy.' 33\n\n34\\. 'He kills five by false testimony regarding a maiden; he kills ten by\nfalse testimony regarding kine; he kills a hundred by false evidence regarding\na horse, and a thousand by false evidence regarding a man.' 34\n\n35\\. (Men) may speak an untruth at the time of marriage, during dalliance,\nwhen their lives are in danger or the loss of their whole property is\nimminent, and for the sake of a Brahma _n_ a; they declare that an untruth\nspoken in these five cases does not make (the speaker) an outcast. 35\n\n36\\. Those who give partial evidence in a judicial proceeding for the sake of\na relative or for money, deprive the ancestors of their spiritual family and\nthose of their natural family of their place in heaven. 36\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[78:2](sbe1419.htm#fr_461) **XVI**. Vish _n_ u III, 72-73. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa\n_n_ _d_ ita gives a second explanation of the Sutra, which also appears\nadmissible, 'Let the king transact the business on the bench, taking counsel\n(with learned Brahma _n_ as as assessors);' see Vish _n_ u III, 72.\n\n[78:3](sbe1419.htm#fr_462) Translated as above the Sutra is nearly equivalent\nto Gautama p. 79 XI, 5. But the phrase 'when two parties have a dispute' may\nalso indicate, as K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita suggests, that the king or\njudge shall not promote litigation, see Gautama XIII, 27. As K _ri_ sh _n_ apa\n_n_ _d_ ita states, the Sutra may, however, mean also, 'when one case is being\nargued, let him not begin another (without finishing the first);' see Manu\nVIII, 43. Owing to the particular nature of the Sutra style and the\ninclination of the Brahmanical mind to double-entendres, I do not think it\nimprobable that the author may have intended, both in this and in the\npreceding Sutras, that his words should be interpreted in two ways.\n\n[79:4](sbe1419.htm#fr_463) Gautama XI, 23-24. I divide the words of the text,\nas follows, 'yathasanam (i.e. yatha-asanam) aparadhohi; antena aparadha _h_ ,'\nand interpolate syat at the end of the first clause.\n\n[79:5](sbe1419.htm#fr_464) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita wrongly divides this\nSutra into two, and wrongly adopts the reading of MSS. B. and E., consequently\nhe obtains a sense only by the most astonishing tricks of interpretation. I\nread with MSS. Bh. and F., yathasanam aparadhohyadyavar _n_ ayor vidyantata\n_h_ , to which the reading of I. O. 913 adyavar _n_ ayor vidhanata _h_ points\nalso. The meaning of the expression, 'according to the sum of the science of\nthe first two castes,' I take to be according to the rules of sacred learning\nand of the mima _m_ sa, which is peculiar to the Brahma _n_ as and of logic\n(anvikshiki) and polity (da _n_ _d_ aniti), which are peculiar to or at least\nrecommended to the particular attention of the Kshatriyas.\n\n[79:6](sbe1419.htm#fr_465) I read with MSS. Bh. and F., sa _m_ panna _m_ _k_ a\nrakshayet. I consider this Sutra to contain an admonition addressed to the\nking for himself; see Manu VII, 99. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita and B. read\nsapattra _m_ _k_ a rakshayet, 'Let him protect that which is attested by\nwritings,' i, e. the donations of former kings, attested by writings; see Vish\n_n_ u III, 83.\n\n[79:7](sbe1419.htm#fr_466) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita thinks that the rule\nrefers to the property of p. 80 the infant children of a hostile king who has\nbeen conquered and slain. It is, however, not improbable that it has a wider\nsense, and exhorts the king to look after the property of the children of his\npredecessor and of deceased feudal barons.\n\n[80:8](sbe1419.htm#fr_467)-9. Gautama X, 48; Vish _n_ u III, 65.\n\n[80:10](sbe1419.htm#fr_468) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 22.\n\n[80:11](sbe1419.htm#fr_469) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita quotes in\nillustration of this Sutra the following passage of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kha and Likhita: 'In\na field through which (there is a right of) road, (space) for the road must be\nset apart, and on the king's high-road a space sufficient for turning a\nchariot.'\n\n[80:12](sbe1419.htm#fr_470) Arthantareshu, 'near other things (of the same\ndescription),' means, according to K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita, 'near\npleasure-gardens and the like: No doubt, buildings of all kinds, fenced or\nwalled gardens, and so forth are meant. I read tripadamatram.\n\n[80:13](sbe1419.htm#fr_471) Manu VIII, 258, 262; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 150,\n152, 154.\n\n[81:15](sbe1419.htm#fr_472) Manu VIII, 259.\n\n[81:16](sbe1419.htm#fr_473) In translating anvadheya by 'property given to a\nwife by her husband or his family after marriage,' I have followed K _ri_ sh\n_n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita's explanation. It may, however, mean also 'a deposit to be\ndelivered to a third person' (anvahita or anvadhi). Pratigraha, 'a gift,' is\nelsewhere explained as 'property promised, but not actually given.'\n\n[81:17](sbe1419.htm#fr_474) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 24; see also Vish _n_ u V,\n187; Manu VIII, 148.\n\n[81:18](sbe1419.htm#fr_475) Identical with Manu VIII, 149; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nII, 25.\n\n[81:19](sbe1419.htm#fr_476) Manu VIII, 30.\n\n[81:20](sbe1419.htm#fr_477) 'If it be otherwise,' i.e. if the owner gave his\nproperty up temporarily only, e.g. went on a journey or a pilgrimage, leaving\nit without anybody to take care of.\n\n[82:28](sbe1419.htm#fr_478) Vish _n_ u VIII, 8; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 68;\nManu VIII, 62-63.\n\n[82:29](sbe1419.htm#fr_479) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 69.\n\n[82:30](sbe1419.htm#fr_480) Manu VIII, 68.\n\n[82:31](sbe1419.htm#fr_481) Vish _n_ u VI, 41; Manu VIII, 159; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 47.\n\n[83:33](sbe1419.htm#fr_482) Identical with Manu VIII, 93.\n\n[83:34](sbe1419.htm#fr_483) Identical with Manu VIII, 98. Regarding the\nexplanation of the words 'he kills,' see Manu VIII, 97, and Haradatta on\nGautama XIII, 14.\n\n[83:35](sbe1419.htm#fr_484) Gautama XXIII, 29. Between this and the preceding\nSutras the MSS. as well as K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita insert another one,\nwhich is so corrupt that I am unable to translate it. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_\n_d_ ita's explanation is opposed to all rules of interpretation, and not worth\ngiving.\n\n[83:36](sbe1419.htm#fr_485) This verse, too, is corrupt, though the general\nsense is not doubtful. I read sva _g_ anasyarthe yadi varthaheto _h_ paksha\n_s_ raye _n_ aiva vadanti karyam--te _s_ abdava _m_ _s_ asya kulasya purvan\nsvargasthita _m_ stanapi patayanti. 'The ancestors of their spiritual family,'\ni.e. the teacher, the teacher's teacher, and so forth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVII](sbe1420.htm)\n\n"
