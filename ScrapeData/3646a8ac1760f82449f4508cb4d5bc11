Charm with the apamarga-plant, against sorcerers and demons.\n\n1\\. Night is like unto the sun, the (starry) night is similar to day. The\ntruth do I engage for help: the enchantments shall be devoid of force!  \n2\\. He, O ye gods, who prepares a spell, and carries it to the house of one\nthat knows not (of it), upon him the spell, returning, shall fasten itself\nlike a suckling calf upon its mother!  \n3\\. The person that prepares evil at home, and desires with it to harm\nanother, she is consumed by fire, and many stones fall upon her with a loud\ncrash.  \n4\\. Bestow curses, O thou (apamarga), that hast a thousand homes, upon the\n(demons) visikha ('crestless'), and vigriva ('crooked-neck')! Turn back the\nspell upon him that has performed it, as a beloved maid (is brought) to her\nlover!  \n5\\. With this plant I have put to naught all spells, those that they have put\ninto thy field, thy cattle, and into thy domestics.  \n6\\. He that has undertaken them has not been able to accomplish them: he broke\nhis foot, his toe. He performed a lucky act for us, but for himself an injury.  \n7\\. The apamarga-plant shall wipe out (apa marshtu) 'inherited ills, and\ncurses; yea, it shall wipe out all witches, and all grudging demons (arayi)!  \n8\\. Having wiped out all sorcerers, and all grudging demons, with thee, O\napamarga, we wipe all that (evil) out.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 19.
