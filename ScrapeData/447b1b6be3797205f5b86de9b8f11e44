Hari _h_ , Om. There lived once _S_ vetaketu \xc3\x82ru _n_ eya (the grandson of\nAru _n_ a). To him his father (Uddalaka, the son of Aru _n_ a) said: ' _S_\nvetaketu, go to school; for there is none belonging to our race, darling, who,\nnot having studied (the Veda), is, as it were, a Brahma _n_ a by birth only.'\n\n2\\. Having begun his apprenticeship (with a teacher) when he was twelve years\nof age 1, _S_ vetaketu returned to his father, when he was twenty-four, having\nthen studied all the Vedas,--conceited, considering himself well-read, and\nstern.\n\n3\\. His father said to him: ' _S_ vetaketu, as you are so conceited,\nconsidering yourself so well-read, and so stern, my dear, have you ever asked\nfor that instruction by which we hear what cannot be heard, by which we\nperceive what cannot be perceived, by which we know what cannot be known?'\n\n4\\. 'What is that instruction, Sir?' he asked.\n\nThe father replied: 'My dear, as by one clod of clay all that is made of clay\nis known, the difference 2 being only a name, arising from speech, but the\ntruth being that all is clay;\n\n5\\. 'And as, my dear, by one nugget of gold 3\n\np. 93\n\nall that is made of gold is known, the difference being only a name, arising\nfrom speech, but the truth being that all is gold?\n\n6\\. 'And as, my dear, by one pair of nail-scissors all that is made of iron\n(karsh _n_ ayasam) is known, the difference being only a name, arising from\nspeech, but the truth being that all is iron,--thus, my dear, is that\ninstruction.'\n\n7\\. The son said: 'Surely those venerable men (my teachers) did not know that.\nFor if they had known it, why should they not have told it me? Do you, Sir,\ntherefore tell me that.' 'Be it so,' said the father.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[92:1](sbe01119.htm#fr_268) This was rather late, for the son of a Brahman\nmight have begun his studies when he was seven years old. \xc3\x82pastamba-sutras I,\n1, 18.
