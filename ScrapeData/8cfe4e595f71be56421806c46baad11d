On account of the unseen principle being non-limitative.\n\nWhile there are many souls, all-pervading like ether, and in equal proximity\nto all bodies from within as well as without, the so-called unseen principle\n(ad _ri_ sh _t_ a), which is of the nature of religious merit or demerit, is\nacquired through mind, speech, and body (i.e. thoughts, words, and actions).--\nNow, according to the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khyas, that principle inheres not in the Self, but\nabides in the pradhana and cannot, on account of the pradhana being the same\n(for all souls), be the limitative cause of the enjoyment of pleasure and pain\nfor each individual Self.--And according to the Ka _n_ adas also the unseen\nprinciple is due to the non-particular conjunction of the Selfs with the\ninternal\n\np. 71\n\norgans, and as thus there is no limitative reason for any particular ad _ri_\nsh _t_ a belonging to any particular soul, the doctrine is open to the same\nobjection.--Well, but there are at work in every particular Self resolutions,\n&c., such as, 'I wish to obtain that result,' 'I wish to avoid that other\nresult,' 'I am striving for that purpose,' 'I wish to act in that way,' &c.\n&c., and these may, we assume, define the relation of ownership in which\nparticular Selfs stand to particular ad _ri_ sh _t_ as.--This objection is\nnegatived in the following Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 52](sbe38053.htm)\n\n"
