One\nafternoon he was seen coming in a carriage with some of his disciples all the\nway from Dakshineswara, a distance of about six miles, to pay a visit to the\nPandit at Badurbagan in Calcutta. As the carriage passed before Raja Rammohun\nRoy\'s \xe2\x80\xa0\n\np. 100\n\nhouse, the Bhagavan suddenly grew silent. His mind wais absorbed in meditation\non the Divine Mother. One of his disciples, not perceiving the sudden change\nthat had come over him, said: "This is Rammohun Roy\'s house." The Bhagavan\nreplied: "Ah! Now my mind is not on such things"; and immediately he entered\ninto the ecstatic state (Bhava).\n\nRamakrishna\'s childlike nature.The carriage, a short while after, drew up in\nfront of the Pandit\'s house. Sri Ramakrishna alighted, supported by one of His\ndisciples. Before reaching the staircase which led to the Pandit\'s study,\nwhich was also the drawing-room, the Bhagavan, putting his hand on His shirt,\nasked a disciple with some concern: "My shirt is unbuttoned; is it necessary\nto button it?" The disciple answered: "Do not trouble Thyself, Lord; none will\nfind fault with Thee on that\n\np. 101\n\naccount." The Bhagavan, like a child, seemed to be satisfied and did not think\nabout it again. The party was then led upstairs into a room where the Pandit\nwas seated in a chair facing the south. A table after the European fashion,\nwith books and papers lying about on it, was before him, and he was talking\nwith some of his friends. As the Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna entered the room,\nthe Pandit rose to receive Him. The Lord stood with His face to the west and\nwith one hand resting upon the table. He looked upon the Pandit intently as if\nhe was an old acquaintance, and with a smile on His sweet, childlike radiant\nface, lost all sense-consciousness, and went into the ecstatic Samadhi.\n\nAfter a while, taking his seat on a bench, the Bhagavan in his semiconscious\nstate uttered, "I wish some water to drink." Thereupon Vidyasagara inquired of\na disciple whether the Bhagavan would also like some delicious sweetmeats\nwhich he had just received from Burdwan. * Finding no objection, the Pandit\nwent into his inner apartments and returned with water and the sweetmeats. He\nplaced them\n\np. 102\n\nbefore the Lord. The disciples partook of the sweetmeats, but when they were\noffered to one young man, Vidyasagara said: "Oh, he is a child of the house;\ndo not trouble about him."\n\nThe Bhagavan then said, referring to a young man who was sitting before him:\n"Yes, this young man is good. He is like the river Falgu, * covered with dry\nsand, but if you dig a little you will find a strong invisible current\nunderneath. He has a spiritual current inside, although he does not show it on\nthe outside."\n\nRamakrishna\'s love of humor.Then addressing Vidyasagara he continued: "To-day\nI have at last reached the ocean (referring to the literal meaning of  the\nword Vidyasagara,--the ocean of knowledge). So long I have seen only canals,\nlakes, or, at most, rivers, but now I see the ocean itself.\n\nVidyasagara: Then, Sir, Thou art welcome to take some salt water from it.\n\nBhagavan: No, my dear sir, why salt water? You are not the ocean of Avidya\n(ignorance),\n\np. 103\n\nwhich leads away from God, but you are the ocean of milk, the ocean of Vidya,\nor true knowledge leading Godward.\n\nVidyasagara: Revered Sir, Thou mayest say _that_.\n\nGood works and compassion for all.Bhagavan: Your Karma proceeds from the\nSattwa element of nature. From it rises compassion. Whatever work is done for\nthe good of others is absolutely free from fault. It may be called Rajasika,\nbut it is the activity of Sattwa. There is no harm in such works. Sukadeva and\nothers like him had compassion for all. They worked for humanity and helped\nmankind in the path of Divinity. You are giving free education and doing\ncharitable works; that is good. He who performs good works through love,\nwithout seeking results, attains to God. But he who works for name, fame or\nany other selfish purpose remains bound. Further, I may say that you have\nalready become _Siddha_ (perfected).\n\nVidyasagara: Sir, how is that?\n\nBhagavan: You know that _Siddha_ , or well-boiled potato, becomes soft and\ntender. Have you not become tender-hearted by your compassion for all?\n\np. 104\n\nVidyasagara: But the paste of Kalai (a kind of pulse) when boiled (Siddha)\nbecomes harder. Is it not so?\n\nBook-learned Pandits like vultures.Bhagavan, laughing: Yes, but you are not\nlike that. Mere book-learned Pandits (scholars) are hard-hearted. They do good\nneither to themselves nor to others. They are like vultures who soar high in\nthe sky, but always search after carrion-pits. They may talk about Divine\ntruths, but their minds are attached to woman and wealth. Their attachment is\nto worldly things (Avidya). Compassion, Devotion (Bhakti), Dispassion\n(Vairagya)--these are the manifestations of Vidya.\n\nVidyasagara was listening to the words of wisdom with whole attention, while\nthe eyes of other gentlemen present were fixed upon the blissful face of\nRamakrishna radiant with Divine glory.\n\nVidya and Avidya.The Bhagavan continued: The Absolute Brahman is beyond the\nreach of Vidya (knowledge) as well as of Avidya (ignorance), which keeps one\naway from the realization of the Absolute.\n\nThe absolute Brahman is beyond the reach of Maya, while Maya is either Vidya\nor Avidya.\n\np. 105\n\n[paragraph continues] Vidya-Maya and Avidya-Maya both exist in this world. As\nthere are knowledge (Jnana) and Devotion (Bhakti), so also there are lust and\ngreed for wealth. Good and evil, virtue and vice, are to be found in this\nworld of relativity; but Brahman is unaffected by them. They exist in relation\nto Jiva (individual ego), but cannot touch the Absolute Brahman.\n\nBrahman untouched by good and evil.Brahman may be compared to the light of a\nlamp. As by the same light one may read the Holy Scriptures and another may\nforge a document, while the light remains unaffected by the good and evil\ndeeds, so is the Absolute Brahman untouched by the good and evil of the world.\nHe is like the Sun who shines equally upon the virtuous and the wicked.\n\nIf you ask, misery, sin, suffering, unhappiness,--whose are these? I should\nanswer, they are for the Jiva. They do not affect the Brahman. Evil to Jiva is\nnot evil to Brahman any more than the venom in the fangs of a snake is poison\nto the snake. Others may die of snake-bite, but as the poison does not hurt\nthe snake, so indeed is the existence of sin and evil in relation to Jiva\nalone. Who can describe what the absolute Brahman is? Whatever\n\np. 106\n\nBrahman indescribable.can be uttered by the mouth has become defiled as it\nwere, like the leavings of food. The Revealed Scriptures, Vedas, Tantras,\nPuranas and all Holy Books, have become defiled as it were, like leavings of\nfood, for they have been uttered by human mouths. But there is one thing that\nis never defiled in this manner and that is the Absolute Brahman. No one has\never succeeded in describing the Absolute by words of mouth. Brahman is\nunspeakable, indescribable, unthinkable.\n\nVidyasagara, interrupting, said to his friends: This is a grand idea. To-day I\nhave learned this truth, that the Brahman is the one substance that has never\nbeen defiled by the mouth.\n\nBhagavan: Yes, that is so.\n\nParable of the Vedic father and his two sons.A certain father had two sons. To\ninstruct them in the knowledge of Brahman he sent them to an \xc3\x82charya\n(preceptor). After a few years they returned home and saluted their father.\nThe father was anxious to know how far they had learned about Brahman, so he\nasked his eldest son: "My dear son, you have studied all the Scriptures and\nphilosophies, tell me what is Brahman like?" The eldest son then tried to\ndescribe\n\np. 107\n\nthe Absolute Brahman by quoting various passages from the Vedas. The father\nkept silent.\n\nTurning to his younger son he asked the same question. The younger son did not\nanswer in words, but remained motionless and communed with the Brahman in\nsilence. The father then exclaimed: "My dear child, thou hast approached the\nrealization of the Brahman. Thy silence is a better answer than the recitation\nof a hundred texts of the Vedas, for Brahman is indescribable by words. It is\nindeed the Absolute Silence." The knowledge of the Absolute Brahman is\nattained in the state of Samadhi. In that superconscious state Brahman is\nrealized. Then all thoughts cease to rise and perfect silence prevails in the\nsoul. Even the power of speech remains unmanifested. How can one describe\nBrahman by words of mouth? Man thinks that he has known the Absolute Brahman.\n\nParable of the ant and the sugar.An ant went to a mount of sugar. The ant did\nnot realize how high was the mountain, but ate a small particle of sugar and\nwas satisfied. It carried home another mount of particle in its mouth. On its\nway it thought: "Next time I will carry the whole mountain." Such, alas, is\nthe thought of\n\np. 108\n\nsmall minds. They think that they have known the Absolute, not realizing that\nBrahman is beyond the reach of mind and thought. However great the mind may be\nit cannot fully comprehend the Absolute Brahman. Sukadeva * and other great\nspiritual teachers may be compared to large ants. They could carry in their\nmouth at utmost eight or ten grains from the mountain of sugar. It is as\nabsurd to say that Brahman has been fully comprehended by a great man as it is\nabsurd to say that the whole mountain of sugar was carried away by a large\nant.\n\nWhat the Vedas and other Scriptures have said about the Absolute is like the\ndescription of the ocean given by a man who saw the vast ocean. When asked\nwhat the ocean was like, he exclaimed in utter amazement: "Oh! what I have\nseen; how vast is the expanse! How big are the waves! What a thundering roar!"\n\nLike unto this is the talk about the Absolute Brahman. The Vedas declare that\nBrahman is\n\np. 109\n\nthe ocean of the Absolute Existence, Intelligence and Bliss. Sukadeva and\nother great\n\nspiritual teachers stood on the shore of that Infinite Ocean, saw it and\ntouched its waters.\n\nSome believe that even those great souls did not go into the Ocean, for\nwhoever enters into that ocean of Brahman does not return to this mundane\nexistence.\n\nParable of a salt doll.A doll made of salt once went to the ocean to measure\nits depth. It had a desire to tell others how deep was the ocean. Alas! Its\ndesire was never satisfied. No sooner had it plunged into the ocean than it\nmelted away and became one with the ocean. Who would bring the news regarding\nthe depth? Similar is the condition of the Jiva (individual ego) who enters\ninto the Infinite Ocean of the Absolute Brahman.\n\nSome one asked: Bhagavan, is it true that the man who has entered into\nSamadhi, or who has acquired _Brahma Jn anam_, does not speak?\n\nBrahman is silence.Ramakrishna to Vidyasagara: Yes, he who has realized\nBrahman becomes silent. Discussions and argumentations exist so long as the\nrealization of the Absolute does not come. If you melt butter in a pan over\nfire, how long does it make a noise?\n\np. 110\n\n[paragraph continues] So long as there is water in it. When the water is\nevaporated it ceases to make further noise. Again if you throw a piece of\ndough in that hot clarified butter (Ghee) there will be noise until the cake\nis thoroughly fried. The soul of a seeker after Brahman may be compared to\nfresh butter. It is mixed with the water of egoism and worldliness.\nDiscussions and argumentations (Vichara) of a seeker are like the noise caused\nduring the process of purification by the fire of knowledge. As the water of\negoism and worldliness is evaporated and the soul becomes purer, all noise of\ndebates and discussions ceases and absolute silence reigns in the state of\nSamadhi.\n\nEgoism of a saint.Thus realizing the Absolute Brahman in silence, the soul\ncomes down on the plane of relativity to help others and to teach mankind the\nhighest wisdom of Brahman. Then he talks again and makes a noise again, as the\nhot Ghee does when in contact with a piece of dough. Such a soul retains the\nsense of "I" simply to help mankind. Sankaracharya and other spiritual\nteachers kept the purified sense of "I" without which all teaching is\nimpossible.\n\nThe bee buzzes so long as it is outside the\n\np. 111\n\nSages teach for the good of others.lotus and does not settle down in its heart\nto drink of the honey. As soon as it tastes of the honey all buzzing is at an\nend. Similarly all noise of discussion ceases when the soul of the neophyte\nbegins to drink the nectar of Divine Love in the Lotus Feet of the Almighty.\nSometimes, however, the bee after being intoxicated by the honey makes a sweet\nhumming sound. So the God-intoxicated soul sometimes speaks for the good of\nothers.\n\nA pitcher makes a noise when it is being filled with water in a tank. But all\nnoise stops as soon as the pitcher is full to the brim. The noise will be\nheard again if some water of the pitcher be poured into another pitcher. (Here\nwater means the water of the Divine Wisdom, and the soul of a wise man is the\npitcher.)\n\nRelation between Guru and disciples.The question flow arises, how do we\nexplain the relation between a perfect Guru and his disciples? The Guru must\ntalk in order to drive away the ignorance of his disciples. This kind of\ndiscrimination, however, does no harm. The boiling butter after it is\nclarified ceases to make any noise; but if the raw cake made of flour is\nthrown into it, it will produce much noise because\n\np. 112\n\nof the water in the cake. The noise will continue until the cake is properly\nfried. The unfried cake may be compared to the disciple, and the boiling\nbutter to the Guru, the spiritual teacher. The sound of teaching is heard so\nlong as the disciple is not perfectly enlightened.\n\nNon-attachment.Sri Ramakrishna continued: So long as the individual soul has\nthe slightest attachment to the world of senses and desires it cannot attain\nto Brahma-Jnana. He is a Jnani who relinquishes all worldly desires and sense-\npleasures by saying, "not this, not this," and then realizes the Supreme\nBrahman in Samadhi.\n\nA Jnani knows that all phenomena of the universe which are subject to\nevolution, whether physical or mental, are within the realm of Maya; they are\nunreal and transitory like the objects of vision in a dream. Therefore as one\nclimbs the stairway step by step until the roof is reached, so he rises above\nthem step by step, saying "not this," until he reaches the Absolute Brahman,\nwhich is the roof of the phenomenal universe.\n\nA Jnani goes so far as to realize that Brahman is the Absolute Reality and all\nphenomena unreal. A Vijnani, however, goes farther and\n\np. 113\n\nAll phenomena unreal.realizes more. He sees that the roof and the steps are\nall made of the same substance. Few can stay long on the roof (the realm of\nthe Absolute). All those who reach this state of Samadhi must return to lower\nplanes, just as no one can sing on "Si," the highest note of the gamut, for a\nlong time. The sense of "I" drags one down. But when a Vijnani returns from\nSamadhi to a lower plane of consciousness and perceives the world of\nrelativity, he sees the Brahman everywhere, and that the same Absolute Being\nappears as Jiva and all the phenomena of the universe. He realizes, "I am\nBrahman," "I am He."\n\nJnana-Yoga and Bhakti-Yoga.There are various paths which lead to the\nrealization of the Absolute Brahman. The path of a Jnani is as good as that of\na Bhakta. Jnana-Yoga is true; so is Bhakti-Yoga. There is another path of\nBhakti mixed with Jnana which is equally true. So long as the sense of "I, me,\nmine" remains in the devotee, the path of Bhakti is easier for him.\n\nA Vijnani, however, realizes the Absolute Brahman as the unchangeable Reality\nof the universe, firm and immutable like the Mount _Sumeru_. It is beyond all\nactivity of Maya.\n\np. 114\n\n[paragraph continues] He also sees that the world has evolved out of the three\n_Gunas_ (Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas) of the Prakriti or Cosmic energy.\n\nMaya.Maya or Prakriti consists of Vidya and Avidya. Vidya is that energy which\nleads Godward. It manifests itself as discrimination (Viveka), non-attachment\n(Vairagya), devotion and love of God (Bhakti, Prema). But Avidya leads to\nworldliness. This energy expresses itself as various passions, desire for\nwealth and honor, ambition, work with attachment, selfishness. All these Vidya\nand Avidya forces rise from the Divine Energy of Brahman--they cannot affect\nthe Brahman. Vijnani and BhaktaThe Vijnani realizes that the same Absolute.\nBrahman appears as the Personal God (Iswara), that He who is beyond all\nattributes is also the Personal God with all attributes and blessed qualities.\nThe Vijnani sees that Jiva (individual ego), phenomenal world, mind,\nintellect, Bhakti, dispassion, knowledge--all these are the glory of the\nsupreme Personal Deity. If these manifestations of the Divine Glory did not\nexist, who would have worshipped Him as the Lord of the universe? If a rich\nman does not possess wealth and property, but becomes bankrupt, nobody will\ncall him rich.\n\np. 115\n\n[paragraph continues] Do you not see how beautiful is this world? How many\nvarieties of phenomena--the Sun, moon, stars, various kinds of animals and\nvegetables, things large and small, good and bad, some men with great powers,\nothers with few.\n\nVidyasagara: Is it then true, Revered Sir, that God has given to some greater\npowers than to others? Is the Lord partial?\n\nUnity in diversity.Bhagavan: The Lord dwells as the all-pervading Being\n(Vibhu) equally within all living creatures great or small, nay, even in the\nsmallest ant or animalcule. The difference lies in the manifestation of powers\n(Sakti), otherwise how will it be possible for one strong man to defeat ten\nmen in a hand-to-hand fight, while a weakling will run away from the presence\nof an ordinary mortal?\n\nIf there were no difference in powers, why should people respect and honor\nyou? You have no monstrosity, like two horns on the forehead, that people will\ncome to see you out of curiosity. You have more compassion, more wisdom than\nothers, therefore people come to see you and pay respects to you. Do you not\nthink so?\n\nThere is nothing in mere book-learning.\n\np. 116\n\n[paragraph continues] Book-learning.One should study books simply to find out\nthe ways by which He (the Absolute Brahman) can be realized.\n\nA holy man had a manuscript with him. Some one asked what it contained. The\nsaint opened it and showed that on every page was written the sacred formula\n"Om Rama, "the holy name of the Lord.\n\nTrue meaning of Gita.Take the sacred book of Bhagavad Gita. What does it\nteach? If you wish to know it repeat the name "Gita" ten times in quick\nsuccession--"Gi-ta, gi-ta, gi-," etc. It will sound like "tagi, tagi," which\nhas the same meaning as the Sanskrit word "Tyagi," that is, one who has\nrenounced everything of the world for the sake of the Lord. One truth which\nBhagavad Gita teaches is this: "O Jiva, giving up attachment to objects and\npleasures of the world, struggle to realize God." The mind of a man (whether a\nsaint or a householder) must be free from all attachment to the world. Then\nand then alone the heart will be purified and the Absolute will be realized.\n\nChaitanya Deva * (God Incarnate of Nuddea),\n\np. 117\n\nwhen travelling on a pilgrimage in the Deccan (Southern India), saw in one\nplace a man reading aloud the texts of the Gita. At a little distance another\nman, with unrestrainable tears running down his cheeks, was listening.\nChaitanya Deva asked him whether he understood the meaning of the texts. The\npoor man replied: "My Lord, I do not understand one word of what the Pandit is\nreading." Chaitanya Deva questioned him: "Why are you weeping, then?" The\ndevotee answered: "I see the chariot of Arjuna, and the Blessed Lord Krishna\nis speaking before him. This Divine vision brings tears of love to my eyes."\n\nSri Ramakrishna continued: You may ask why does a Vijnani prefer to have\nBhakti (love and devotion)? The answer is--Because it is difficult for one to\nbe free from the sense of "I." In the state of _Nirvikalpa Sam adhi_, * it may\nvanish for the time being, but it comes back again; while for ordinary\nindividuals it is almost impossible to eliminate this sense of "I, me and\nmine." However many times you may cut\n\np. 118\n\nSense of "I."off the branches of the _Aswatthwa_ tree, so long as the root is\nalive new branches will sprout; similarly you may try to get rid of the sense\nof "I, "but so long as the root is alive it will sprout up again and again.\nEven after acquiring Brahma-Jnana the emancipated soul is forced back to the\nplane of this "Aham" sense of "I."\n\nIf you dream of a tiger you will tremble in every limb and your heart will\nthrob violently. When you wake up you may realize that it was a mere dream,\nbut still your heart will go on palpitating all the same. Similarly the sense\nof "I" remains even after the realization of the Absolute.\n\nThus, if the sense of "I" is the cause of all troubles and it is impossible to\nhe free from it, let it stay on as "I," the servant of the Lord.\n\nRama Chandra (the God Incarnate) once asked his great devotee Hanuman: "My\nson, in what relation do you regard me?" The devotee replied: "When I think of\nmyself as embodied, I am Thy servant and Thou art the Lord. When I think of\nmyself as the Jiva (Ego) I am Thy part and Thou art the Universal Whole; but\nwhen I think of myself as the\n\np. 119\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc3\x82tman, I am one with Thee. Then I realize \'I am Thou and\nThou art I.\'"\n\nIf the sense of "I" clings to one so persistently, let it remain like that of\na true Bhakta who thinks of himself as the servant of the Lord.\n\nAjnanam and Jnanam"I" and "mine"--these two are the signs of _Ajn anam_,\nignorance. My house, my wealth, my learning, my glory, all these are mine--\nthis idea proceeds from ignorance of one\'s true Self, but _Jn anam_ or divine\nknowledge means that state where Jiva realizes: "O Lord, Thou art the Master\nof all; house, family, children, friends, relatives, nay, whatever exists in\nthe universe belongs to Thee." "Whatever is mine is Thine." "Nothing belongs\nto me"--such ideas rise from true knowledge.\n\nIt is good for everyone to remember that after death nothing of this world\nwill remain with us. We have come here simply to perform certain Karma and\ngain some experience. Just as country people come to a big city like Calcutta\nto do some work, so we have come to fulfil our desires according to the\ntendencies with which we were born.\n\nA rich man has given the charge of his beautiful\n\np. 120\n\nParable of the rich man and his Sircar.garden to his _Sircar_ (steward). When\nvisitors come to see the garden the _Sircar_ waits on them attentively. He\nshows them the beautiful parts of the garden with luxurious fruit-trees,\nflower-beds, palace-like buildings, lakes, etc., saying. "These are,\ngentlemen, our mango-trees. This is our orchard; this is our lake; how\nbeautiful are our flowers! Here you see is our drawing-room with most\nexpensive furniture, fine paintings by the best artists--all these belong to\nus." The same _Sircar_ may be found fault with and dismissed by his master at\nany time with peremptory order to leave the garden at once. He will not be\nallowed sufficient time to pack up his trunk and take his own baggage with\nhim. Such is the miserable plight of those who lay claim upon things which do\nnot in reality belong to them.\n\nEverything belongs to the Lord. It is ridiculous for man to say, "I am Karta"\n(the doer), "All these things are mine."\n\nThe Lord smiles on two occasions.On two occasions the Lord cannot help\nsmiling: A person is taken seriously ill and is about to die. The physician\nsays to the mother of the patient: "Mother, there is no cause for fear. I\nshall save\n\np. 121\n\nyour son\'s life." The physician forgets that the will of the Lord is at the\nroot of every event of life and death. The Lord then smiles, thinking: "How\nfoolish this man must be who boasts of saving the life of his patient when the\nlatter is dying under My will." The Lord smiles again when two brothers are\nengaged in partitioning their estate. They take a measuring-tape and, putting\nit out across the land, say: "This portion is mine, and that is yours." The\nLord smiles, thinking: "The whole Universe belongs to Me, but these foolish\nbrothers say: \'This portion is mine and that is yours.\'"\n\n"O Lord, Thou makest everything and Thou art my nearest and dearest One. This\nhouse, this family, these relatives, these friends of mine, nay, this whole\nuniverse belongs to Thee, O Lord." Such is the nature of true Jnana\n(knowledge). But "I do everything, I am the doer. My house, my family, my\nchildren, my friends, everything belongs to me"; all this proceeds from Ajnana\n(ignorance).\n\nThe Lord alone is thine own.A Guru was giving this instruction to his\ndisciple: "The Lord alone is thine own and no one else belongs to thee." The\ndisciple replied: "But my mother and my wife, who take such good care of me,\nwho love\n\np. 122\n\nme and feel extremely unhappy when they do not see me, are also my own, are\nthey not?" The Guru answered: "In this you are mistaken. I will show you that\nnone of them truly cares for you. Never believe for a moment that your mother\nor wife will sacrifice her life for your sake. You can try and see. Go home\nand feign excruciating pain and I will come and show you." The disciple acted\naccordingly. Doctors were called in, but no one could afford relief. The\nmother of the patient was sorrowing and sighing. The wife and children were\nweeping. At this moment the Sannyasin (Guru) appeared. "The disease is of a\nserious nature," he said, "and I do not see any chance of the patient\'s\nrecovery unless some one come forward to give his or her life for the\npatient." At this all of them looked aghast. The Sannyasin, addressing the old\nmother of the sick man, said: "To live or to die will be the same thing to\nyou, if in your old age you lose your son who earns for himself and for you\nall. If you can give your life in exchange for his, I can save your son. If\nyou, as mother, cannot make this sacrifice for him, who else in the world will\ncare to do it?" The old woman stammered through her tears: "Revered father, I\nam ready to do\n\np. 123\n\nanything you order for the sake of my son. But the thing is, my own life--and\nwhat is my life in comparison to that of my son? The thought--what will become\nof my little ones after my death, makes me a coward. Unfortunate that I am,\nthese little ones are in my way!"\n\nWhile listening to this dialogue between the Sannyasin and her mother-in-law,\nthe wife wept bitterly and, addressing her parents, said: "For your sake, dear\nfather and mother, I cannot make the sacrifice." In this way everyone found an\nexcuse. Then the Sannyasin turned to the patient and said: "Do you see, no one\nhere is ready to sacrifice his life for you. Do you understand now what I\nmeant by saying that there was no depending on anybody?" When the disciple saw\nall this, he abandoned his so-called home and followed the Sannyasin, his\nGuru.\n\nSelf-surrender and prayer.Sri Ramakrishna continued: The Absolute Brahman\ncannot be known by reasoning. Be his servant and taking refuge with Him pray\nto Him with earnestness and sincerity. He will surely reveal Himself unto you.\nBook-learning or intellectual discussions cannot reveal the Divinity.\n\nThus saying the Blessed One sang:\n\np. 124\n\nThe Glory of the Divine Mother\n\n1\\. Who knoweth what is Kali (my Divine Mother)?  \nEven the Six Schools of Philosophy get not a glimpse of Her.\n\n2\\. The Yogi ever meditateth upon Her at the Muladhara and the Sahasrara.  \nAs the swans, male and female, commune with each other, so in this lotus\n(Lotus here is a symbol of Plexus) forest doth Kali commune with Her consort\n(Shiva).\n\n3\\. Kali, the soul of \xc3\x82tmarama (Shiva), is as beloved as Sita is of Rama. The\nmajesty of Kali, Shiva (Kala) alone can know, forsooth who else may know it?\n\n4\\. For She giveth birth unto the universe; think how vast She is.  \nShe dwelleth within all things as the will omnipotent.\n\n5\\. The Psalmist (Prasad) * singeth: "Mortals\n\np. 125\n\nmay laugh at the thought of swimming across the mighty ocean," and this my\nmind perceiveth, but my heart enfoldeth it not; yet it still aspireth to touch\nthe moon.\n\nThe Blessed One, referring to this song, said: See how Ramaprasad describes\nthat books and reasoning cannot reveal the Divine Mother. Faith is necessary.\n\nThe omnipotence of faith.Reason is weak. Faith is omnipotent. Reason cannot go\nfar enough and must stop short of the goal. Faith will work wonders.\n\nThe parable of a Brahmin priest and his boy.There was a certain Brahmin priest\nwho served in a household chapel. Once he went away leaving the charge of the\nservice to his son. He told the boy to place the daily offering of food before\nthe Deity and see that He ate it. The boy, following the instructions of his\nfather, placed the offering before the image and silently waited. But the\nimage neither spoke nor ate. The boy watched for a long tinge. He had firm\nfaith that the Deity would come down from the altar, take the seat before the\noffering and eat it. Then he prayed: "O Lord, come and eat. It is\n\np. 126\n\ngetting very late; I cannot wait any longer." But the Lord did not speak. Then\nthe boy began to cry, saying: "Lord, my father told me to see that Thou didst\neat the offering. Why dost Thou not come. Thou comest to my father and eatest\nhis offering. What have I done that Thou dost not come to me and eat my\noffering?" He cried bitterly and for a long time. Then as he looked up at the\nseat, he saw the Deity in a human form eating the offering. When the service\nwas ended and the boy came out, the members of the household said to him, "If\nthe service is over, bring out the offering." The boy replied: "Yes, but the\nLord has eaten everything." In amazement they asked: "What did you say?" With\nabsolute innocence the boy repeated: "Why, the Lord has eaten all that I\noffered." Then they entered the chapel and were dumbfounded at the sight of\nthe empty dishes. Such is the power of true faith and true yearning!\n\nYes, faith will enable a man to cross the mighty ocean itself without the\nleast difficulty. In the epic Ramayana it is said: Rama Chandra (God\nIncarnate) worked hard to throw a bridge over the part of the sea separating\nLanka (Ceylon) from the mainland of India. But as if\n\np. 127\n\nto prove the majesty, the omnipotence of faith, He gave it to His Bhakta, the\ngreat Hanuman, * to jump across the ocean by the unaided power of faith.\n\nIt is also told that once a Bhakta, a friend of Vibhishana, \xe2\x80\xa0 wanted to go\nacross the sea. Vibhishana, to whom he appealed for help, had the name of Rama\n(God) written on a leaf, without the knowledge of his friend. He then said to\nthe Bhakta: "Take this and be careful that you have it tied to the end of your\ncloth. It will enable you to walk across the ocean in safety. But mind, never\nlook inside, for you will go under the water if you open it." The Bhakta put\nfaith in his friend\'s words and walked on the ocean in safety for some time,\nbut unfortunately his curiosity became his enemy. He wanted to see what\nprecious thing Vibhishana had given him that had the power\n\np. 128\n\nof taking him unhurt over the mighty deep. When he opened it he discovered a\nleaf with the name of Rama written on it. He thought what a trifling thing it\nwas; no sooner did that thought arise in his mind than he was drowned.\n\nThose who belong to this class of Jivas cannot easily have faith in God, but\nthose who are born with Divine qualities possess the highest faith naturally.\nWhen Prahlada * tried to write the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, "K,"\nit brought up before his mind the name Krishna, and he began to cry. The\nnatural tendency of a Jiva is to doubt and to become sceptical. Hazra \xe2\x80\xa0 will\nnot believe in the truth that Brahman and Divine Mother, the Absolute and His\nEnergy, are one and the same. Yet, faith is omnipotent. Before it all the\npowers of nature shrink and give way. It carries one over seas and mountains\nwith perfect ease. Sin and\n\np. 129\n\niniquity, worldliness and ignorance all vanish before true faith.\n\nThe Bhagavan sang:\n\nThe Name of the Lord\n\n1\\. O my Divine Mother, if I die with Thy hallowed name (Durga, Durga) on my\nlips.  \nThen in the end, O Giver of all Bliss, shall it be seen whether Thou savest\nThy poor child drowning in the ocean of sin.\n\n2\\. I might have slain a cow or a Brahmin or an unborn child!  \nI might be a drunkard, nay more, the slayer of a woman!  \nBut of all these dire sins I have not the slightest fear.  \nThrough faith in Thy Holy Name I can reach the highest bliss of Brahman.\n\nYes, faith is at the root of all spiritual progress. Thou canst do without all\nother things, only thou must have faith. Have but faith in the Lord and thou\nshalt become at once free from the vilest, the blackest, of all sins.\n\nThe one thing needed is faith and Bhakti--love, devotion, prayerfulness, self-\nsurrender. It\n\np. 130\n\nis exceedingly difficult, especially in this age, for a man with his limited\nfaculties to come to my Mother through Vichara ([discrimination](errata.htm#3)\nof the Real Brahman from the unreal phenomenal universe), unaided by the\nDivine Person. Verily has Prasad, the "Sweet Psalmist" of Bengal, laid stress\non this difficulty in his well-known song:\n\nThe Divine Mother and the Absolute Brahman\n\n1\\. Like a mad man, O mind, what seekest thou in the dark room?  \nHe (Divine Being) cometh in deep meditation; without that, who can approach\nHim?\n\n2\\. The moon of desire still shineth in thy secret chamber.  \nFirst bring it under control with all thy might. It will hide itself at the\ndawn of Divine wisdom.\n\n3\\. Holding this as the ideal, the great Yogi practiseth meditation for ages.\nWhen realization cometh it attracts the soul as a, magnet draws unto itself a\npiece of iron.\n\np. 131\n\n4\\. Thou shalt not find It in the Six Schools of Philosophy, in the Vedas,\nTantras or in the Holy Scriptures. It loveth the sweetness of true devotion\n(Bhakti) and abideth in the body with everlasting Bliss.\n\n5\\. Prasad says: O mind, shall I disclose in public ( _Ch ator_) the true\nnature of that which I worship as my Divine Mother? Guess and understand it\nfrom these hints.\n\nThere was a deep silence at the close of this song, which had been listened to\nwith rapt attention. Everyone was moved.\n\nRamakrishna\'s samadhi.At the end of this song the Bhagavan was once more found\nto be in that indescribable state of _Sam adhi_. His sweet divine voice became\nstill. His eyes remained fixed and steadfast. But his spiritual eye was\nfeasting on the beatific Vision of the Divine Glory! There was left just\nenough of self-consciousness to bring the soul face to face with the Divine\nMother. This blessed Vision the Bhagavan enjoyed for a long time. His face was\nradiant with celestial light and expressed by sweet smiles the unbounded\nhappiness which He was enjoying within Himself, and\n\np. 132\n\nin His semiconscious state He uttered these words:\n\nWhat is Bhakti?Bhakti, or devotion, means whole-hearted love for the Lord. The\nAbsolute Brahman is called "Divine Mother" by the Psalmist. Prasad asks his\nmind to understand it by hints; He who is described in the Vedas as the\nAbsolute Brahman is my Divine Mother; I am praying to Her.\n\nBrahman impersonal and personal.That which is the Absolute (Nirguna),\nimpersonal beyond all attributes, is also the same as the Personal God who is\nwith all attributes and blessed qualities. The Absolute Brahman again is\ninseparable from the Divine energy (Sakti).\n\nThe term "Brahman" refers to that aspect of Divinity which is impersonal and\nwhich is beyond all activity. But when we think of Him as creating, preserving\nand destroying all phenomena, then we call Him the Personal God, Divine Mother\nor Kali.\n\nBrahman and Sakti are one.In reality there is no distinction between\n"Brahman," or the Impersonal Absolute, and "Sakti," the Divine Mother. The\nBrahman and the Sakti are one just as fire and its burning power are one. As\nby the word fire we understand its power of burning,\n\np. 133\n\nso by the latter we know that it is the same as fire. By realizing the one\nboth are realized.\n\nThey are one just as much as milk and its whiteness are one. We cannot\nconceive the milk without the whiteness.\n\nThey are one just as a gem and its brightness are one. We cannot conceive a\ngem without the brightness.\n\nThey are one just as the serpent and its sinuous motion are one. We cannot\nconceive of the serpent without the serpentine movements.\n\nHe who knows what "light" is has the knowledge of darkness also. He who has\nthe conception of the phenomenal world must have also some conception of the\nAbsolute Noumenon. He who knows the Sakti, or the Personal aspect of the\nAbsolute Being, knows also the Impersonal Brahman. Again, he who has realized\nthe Absolute Noumenon has also realized the phenomenon. He who has realized\nBrahman has also realized the Personal God or Divine Mother (Sakti).\n\nThe power the Divine Mother.This Divine Mother bestows the highest of\nknowledge of Brahman (Brahma-jnana) by bringing her devotee into the state of\n_Sam adhi_. She it is who brings him down on the plane of sense-consciousness\n\np. 134\n\nand allows him to retain the sense of "I" and "me."\n\nBy the power of my Divine Mother all mortals (Jiva) possess the sense of "I"\nand "mine." She again reveals to the soul of one who is in _Sam adhi_, that\nall living beings, nay, the whole universe, is but the manifestation of the\nDivine Energy.\n\nIt is She who makes one reach the Brahma-jnana, the highest knowledge of the\nAbsolute, and She again makes another Her beloved devotee who surrenders\nhimself to Her omnipotent Will. This truth is the great secret of all secrets.\nTherefore the Psalmist says: "Shall I disclose it in the _Ch ator_?"\n\nVidyasagara asked his friend who was sitting near by: "Do you understand the\nmeaning of _Ch ator_?" The friend replied: "I know that \' _Chattara\'_ means a\ncourtyard within a house."\n\nVidyasagara: Exactly. It may also mean a public market-place. So Rama Prasad\ndoes not want to make this secret known to the public.\n\nBhagavan with his smiling face spoke to Vidyasagara: "Oh, you are a Pandit, a\ngreat scholar, you must know all this." When I sing the praise of my Divine\nMother I refer to the\n\np. 135\n\nsame Absolute Brahman. The term "Mother" is very sweet. Therefore I like to\ncall Him "Mother." We must learn to love the Personal God (Iswara). Through\nlove He can be easily attained. Love, devotion and faith are the most\nvaluable. Listen to another song. The Bhagavan sang again:\n\nLove for the Divine Mother\n\n1\\. Ecstasy dawneth when I meditate upon my Divine Mother.  \nAs is the ardor of thought so is the attainment; but the root must be perfect\nfaith.\n\n2\\. If the mind diveth into the sea of Bliss at the feet of my Mother, then is\nthere no further need of worship, rituals, sacrifice or repetition of the\nLord\'s name.\n\n3\\. The devotee of the Divine Mother is free even in this life and doth enjoy\neverlasting Bliss.\n\nThe Lord, the Ocean of Immortality.He who can dive into the sea of Bliss\nbecomes immortal. The Lord is described in the Vedas as the Ocean of Immortal\nBliss. Whosoever enters into it becomes free from death. Some people have a\nwrong idea that too much meditation upon\n\np. 136\n\nthe Absolute will unbalance the mind. No one becomes unbalanced by meditating\nupon the Absolute.\n\nDevotional exercises, rituals, ceremonials, sacrifices or the pouring of\noblations into the sacred fire--such works are needless when true love for the\nLord comes in the heart of the devotee. A fan is needed so long as there is no\nbreeze. So when the breeze of Divine Love blows all ritualistic works become\nunnecessary.\n\nselfless works purify the heart.Referring to Vidyasagara the Bhagavan\ncontinued: The works which you are doing are good works. If you can perform\nthem without seeking their result and without thinking that you are the "doer,\n"then it will he still better. The highest result of works done in this\nselfless manner is the attainment of true love for God. Such works purify the\nheart and bring God-consciousness in the end. But as your love for the Lord\nbecomes more and more intense, your religious works will become less and less.\nA married woman diligently performs the household duties, but she is not\nallowed to do any heavy work when she is about to give birth to her child. You\nare doing charitable works and other works for the good of humanity. In\n\np. 137\n\nDoing good to the world.reality, however, they are of great help to yourself.\nThey will purify your heart and bring unselfish love for God. Man has no power\nto do good to the world; the Lord doth everything. He who hath made the Sun\nand the moon, He who hath given affection in the hearts of parents, He who\nhath bestowed compassion upon the great souls, He who hath brought unselfish\nlove and devotion in the hearts of saints and sages, doth everything for the\ngood of His world; who else hath the power to perform any good act? Whosoever\nperformeth good works without holding any desire for their fruits will do good\nfor himself.\n\nThere is gold inside, under the cover of earth. You have not discovered it\nyet. If you once realize this secret treasure your worldly duties will vanish\nand you will not care for other works, just as a mother loves nothing better\nthan to fondle and kiss her new-born baby. Go onward and do not stop in one\nplace. Remember the parable * of the wood-cutter and stop not until the goal\nis reached. The goal is the realization of God. By His grace His true\n\np. 138\n\ndevotee can see Him and can talk with Him just as I am talking with you.\n\nAbsolute silence prevailed when the Blessed Lord spoke these words with fire\nand eloquence. Everyone\'s heart was moved by that divine love which was\nflowing with mighty force within the soul of Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna.\n\nWith a smiling face the Bhagavan said: You know all that I have told, but you\ndo not realize how much you possess, in the same manner as Varuna, the Lord of\nthe ocean, does not care to know how many beautiful and valuable jewels there\nare in His boundless treasury of the deep.\n\nVidyasagara: Revered Sir, Thou canst say so.\n\nBhagavan: Yes; do you not know that very often a millionaire Babu does not\nknow even the names of his own attendants? He does not remember in what places\nhis valuable things are kept.\n\nEveryone was listening to this interesting conversation when Bhagavan suddenly\nasked Vidyasagara: "Will you not come to the Temple garden? It is a beautiful\nplace."\n\nVidyasagara: O yes; certainly. Thou hast been so kind as to come to me, shall\nI not return my visit to Thee?\n\np. 139\n\nBhagavan: A visit to me! Oh, for shame! for shame!\n\nVidyasagara: My dear Sir, this from Thee! I wish to know why dost Thou say so?\n\nHumility of Ramakrishna.Bhagavan: Well, we are like fishing-boats, small and\nlight enough to row about on ponds, narrow canals or even on large rivers, but\nyou are like a big steamer. Who can tell?--you might founder on the sand-bank\nif you venture too far up the stream; but now at this season steamers may go\nup without much danger.\n\nVidyasagara: Oh I see; this is the rainy season.\n\nAt about eight in the evening it was announced that the carriage was ready to\ntake Sri Ramakrishna back to the Thakurbadi at Dakshineswara. The Bhagavan\nbecame absent-minded for a while; perhaps His mind was fixed upon the Divine\nMother, or perhaps He was asking Her blessing upon His kind host. The Bhagavan\nthen rose to bid him farewell and Vidyasagara, with a lighted candle in his\nhand, led the way down-stairs and through the compound of his house to the\ngate. Outside the gate a carriage was waiting to receive the honored guest and\nHis devoted companions from the Thakurbadi. An unexpected sight greeted the\neyes of the\n\np. 140\n\nparty as they came out. It was a man who might have been a little under forty\nstanding before the gate with folded hands. He was dressed in white and wore a\nwhite turban on his head. He had a fair complexion and expressive eyes and a\nsmile was on his face. No sooner did he see the Bhagavan than he fell at His\nfeet with his head touching the ground.\n\nThe Bhagavan said: Is it you, Balaram? How is it that I find you here?\n\nBalaram * replied, smiling: O Revered Sir, I have been waiting for some time\nhere at the gate to see Thee.\n\nBhagavan: Why did you not come in?\n\nBalaram: I came late, so I would not interrupt Thee, but thought it better to\nstay here.\n\nThe Bhagavan then stepped into the carriage with His companions.\n\nVidyasagara asked a disciple: Shall I see the carriage hire paid?\n\nThe disciple replied: No, Sir, you need not\n\np. 141\n\ntrouble yourself. It has already been paid by a friend.\n\nRamakrishna leaves Vidyasagara.The Pandit then folded his hands and bent his\nheld and body to make his Pranama (Salutation) to the Bhagavan. All assembled\nabout the carriage did the same.  The little group at the gate, with the\nvenerable Vidyasagara at their head still holding the lighted candle in his\nhand, stood for a while looking in the direction of the carriage, wondering\nwho this God-intoxicated Man might be, so wise yet so child-like, so full of\njoy, so sweet, so godly! Verily a Light come down to set ablaze the dry bones\nof a workaday world! Embodied Love, like the dew of heaven falling on the dry\nthirsty heart of man! A Voice crying unto sunken, self-weary man, "Thou must\nbe born again and love!" A Healer from another clime of this strange disease\nof modern life! A Man among men, eager to solve for them the enigma of the\nuniverse!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[99:*](gork07.htm#fr_21) Pandit Iswara Chandra Vidyasagara was the greatest\nHindu scholar of his time in Calcutta.
