Now, pickpocket, tell us where you\nfound this ring. It is the king\'s ring, with letters engraved on it, and it\nhas a magnificent great gem.\n\n_Fisherman_ ( _showing fright_ ). Be merciful, kind gentlemen. I am not guilty\nof such a crime.\n\n_First policeman_. No, I suppose the king thought you were a pious Brahman,\nand made you a present of it.\n\n_Fisherman_. Listen, please. I am a fisherman, and I live on the Ganges, at\nthe spot where Indra came down.\n\n_Second policeman_. You thief, we didn\'t ask for your address or your social\nposition.\n\n_Chief_. Let him tell a straight story, Suchaka. Don\'t interrupt.\n\n_The two policemen_. Yes, chief. Talk, man, talk.\n\n_Fisherman_. I support my family with things you catch fish with--nets, you\nknow, and hooks, and things.\n\n_Chief_ ( _laughing_ ). You have a sweet trade.\n\n_Fisherman_. Don\'t say that, master.\n\nYou can\'t give up a lowdown trade  \n  That your ancestors began;  \nA butcher butchers things, and yet  \n  He\'s the tenderest-hearted man.\n\n_Chief_. Go on. Go on.\n\n_Fisherman_. Well, one day I was cutting up a carp. In its maw I see this ring\nwith the magnificent great gem. And then I was just trying to sell it here\nwhen you kind gentlemen grabbed me. That is the only way I got it. Now kill\nme, or find fault with me.\n\n_Chief_ ( _smelling the ring_ ). There is no doubt about it,\n\np. 64\n\n_Januka_. It has been in a fish\'s maw. It has the real perfume of raw meat.\nNow we have to find out how he got it. We must go to the palace.\n\n_The two policemen_ ( _to the fisherman_ ). Move on, you cutpurse, move on. (\n_They walk about_.)\n\n_Chief_. Suchaka, wait here at the big gate until I come out of the palace.\nAnd don\'t get careless.\n\n_The two policemen_. Go in, chief. I hope the king will be nice to you.\n\n_Chief_. Good-bye. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_Suchaka_. Januka, the chief is taking his time.\n\n_Januka_. You can\'t just drop in on a king.\n\n_Suchaka_. Januka, my fingers are itching ( _indicating the fisherman_ ) to\nkill this cutpurse.\n\n_Fisherman_. Don\'t kill a man without any reason, master.\n\n_Januka_ ( _looking ahead_ ). There is the chief, with a written order from\nthe king. ( _To the fisherman_.) Now you will see your family, or else you\nwill feed the crows and jackals. ( _Enter the chief_.)\n\n_Chief_. Quick! Quick! ( _He breaks off_.)\n\n_Fisherman_. Oh, oh! I\'m a dead man. ( _He shows dejection_.)\n\n_Chief_. Release him, you. Release the fishnet fellow. It is all right, his\ngetting the ring. Our king told me so himself.\n\n_Suchaka_. All right, chief. He is a dead man come back to life. ( _He\nreleases the fisherman_.)\n\n_Fisherman_ ( _bowing low to the chief_ ). Master, I owe you my life. ( _He\nfalls at his feet_.)\n\n_Chief_. Get up, get up! Here is a reward that the king was kind enough to\ngive you. It is worth as much as the ring. Take it. ( _He hands the fisherman\na bracelet_.)\n\n_Fisherman_ ( _joyfully taking it_ ). Much obliged.\n\n_Januka_. He is much obliged to the king. Just as if he had been taken from\nthe stake and put on an elephant\'s back.\n\n_Suchaka_. Chief, the reward shows that the king thought a lot of the ring.\nThe gem must be worth something.\n\n_Chief_. No, it wasn\'t the fine gem that pleased the king. It was this way.\n\n_The two policemen_. Well?\n\n_Chief_. I think, when the king saw it, he remembered\n\np. 65\n\nsomebody he loves. You know how dignified he is usually. But as soon as he saw\nit, he broke down for a moment.\n\n_Suchaka_. You have done the king a good turn, chief.\n\n_Januka_. All for the sake of this fish-killer, it seems to me. ( _He looks\nenviously at the fisherman_.)\n\n_Fisherman_. Take half of it, masters, to pay for something to drink.\n\n_Januka_. Fisherman, you are the biggest and best friend I\'ve got. The first\nthing we want, is all the brandy we can hold. Let\'s go where they keep it. (\n_Exeunt omnes_.)\n\n#### SCENE II.-- _In the Palace Gardens_.\n\n( _Enter_ MISHRAKESHI, _flying through the air_.)\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. I have taken my turn in waiting upon the nymphs. And now I will\nsee what this good king is doing. Shakuntala is like a second self to me,\nbecause she is the daughter of Menaka. And it was she who asked me to do this.\n( _She looks about_.) It is the day of the spring festival. But I see no\npreparations for a celebration at court. I might learn the reason by my power\nof divination. But I must do as my friend asked me. Good! I will make myself\ninvisible and stand near these girls who take care of the garden. I shall find\nout that way. ( _She descends to earth. Enter a maid, gazing at a mango\nbranch, and behind her, a second_.)\n\n_First maid_.\n\nFirst mango-twig, so pink, so green,  \n  First living breath of spring,  \nYou are sacrificed as soon as seen,  \n  A festival offering.\n\n_Second maid_. What are you chirping about to yourself, little cuckoo?\n\n_First maid_. Why, little bee, you know that the cuckoo goes crazy with\ndelight when she sees the mango-blossom.\n\n_Second maid_ ( _joyfully_ ). Oh, has the spring really come?\n\n_First maid_. Yes, little bee. And this is the time when you too buzz about in\ncrazy joy.\n\np. 66\n\n_Second maid_. Hold me, dear, while I stand on tiptoe and offer this blossom\nto Love, the divine.\n\n_First maid_. If I do, you must give me half the reward of the offering.\n\n_Second maid_. That goes without saying, dear. We two are one. ( _She leans on\nher friend and takes the mango-blossom_.) Oh, see! The mango-blossom hasn\'t\nopened, but it has broken the sheath, so it is fragrant. ( _She brings her\nhands together_.) I worship mighty Love,\n\nO mango-twig I give to Love  \n  As arrow for his bow,  \nMost sovereign of his arrows five,  \n  Strike maiden-targets low.\n\n( _She throws the twig. Enter the chamberlain_.)\n\n_Chamberlain_ ( _angrily_ ). Stop, silly girl. The king has strictly forbidden\nthe spring festival. Do you dare pluck the mango-blossoms?\n\n_The two maids_ ( _frightened_ ). Forgive us, sir. We did not know.\n\n_Chamberlain_. What! You have not heard the king\'s command, which is obeyed\neven by the trees of spring and the creatures that dwell in them. See!\n\nThe mango branches are in bloom,  \n  Yet pollen does not form;  \nThe cuckoo\'s song sticks in his throat,  \n  Although the days are warm;\n\nThe amaranth-bud is formed, and yet  \n  Its power of growth is gone;  \nThe love-god timidly puts by  \n  The arrow he has drawn.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. There is no doubt of it. This good king has wonderful power.\n\n_First maid_. A few days ago, sir, we were sent to his Majesty by his brother-\nin-law Mitravasu to decorate the garden. That is why we have heard nothing of\nthis affair.\n\n_Chamberlain_. You must not do so again.\n\n_The two maids_. But we are curious. If we girls may know about it, pray tell\nus, sir. Why did his Majesty forbid the spring festival?\n\np. 67\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. Kings are fond of celebrations. There must be some good reason.\n\n_Chamberlain_ ( _to himself_ ). It is in everybody\'s mouth. Why should I not\ntell it? ( _Aloud_.) Have you heard the gossip concerning Shakuntala\'s\nrejection?\n\n_The two maids_. Yes, sir. The king\'s brother-in-law told us, up to the point\nwhere the ring was recovered.\n\n_Chamberlain_. There is little more to tell. When his Majesty saw the ring, he\nremembered that he had indeed contracted a secret marriage with Shakuntala,\nand had rejected her under a delusion. And then he fell a prey to remorse.\n\nHe hates the things he loved; he intermits  \nThe daily audience, nor in judgment sits;  \nSpends sleepless nights in tossing on his bed;  \nAt times, when he by courtesy is led  \nTo address a lady, speaks another name,  \nThen stands for minutes, sunk in helpless shame.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. I am glad to hear it.\n\n_Chamberlain_. His Majesty\'s sorrow has forbidden the festival.\n\n_The two maids_. It is only right.\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. Follow me.\n\n_Chamberlain_ ( _listening_ ). Ah, his Majesty approaches. Go, and attend to\nyour duties. ( _Exeunt the two maids. Enter the king, wearing a dress\nindicative of remorse; the clown, and the portress_.)\n\n_Chamberlain_ ( _observing the king_ ). A beautiful figure charms in whatever\nstate. Thus, his Majesty is pleasing even in his sorrow. For\n\nAll ornament is laid aside; he wears  \n  One golden bracelet on his wasted arm;  \nHis lip is scorched by sighs; and sleepless cares  \n  Redden his eyes. Yet all can work no harm  \nOn that magnificent beauty, wasting, but  \nGaining in brilliance, like a diamond cut.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_ ( _observing the king_ ). No wonder Shakuntala pines for him,\neven though he dishonoured her by his rejection of her.\n\np. 68\n\n_King_ ( _walks about slowly, sunk in thought_ ).\n\nAlas! My smitten heart, that once lay sleeping,  \n  Heard in its dreams my fawn-eyed love\'s laments,  \nAnd wakened now, awakens but to weeping,  \n  To bitter grief, and tears of penitence.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. That is the poor girl\'s fate.\n\n_Clown_ ( _to himself_ ). He has got his Shakuntala-sickness again. I wish I\nknew how to cure him.\n\n_Chamberlain_ ( _advancing_ ). Victory to your Majesty. I have examined the\ngarden. Your Majesty may visit its retreats.\n\n_King_. Vetravati, tell the minister Pishuna in my name that a sleepless night\nprevents me from mounting the throne of judgment. He is to investigate the\ncitizens\' business and send me a memorandum.\n\n_Portress_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_King_. And you, Parvatayana, return to your post of duty.\n\n_Chamberlain_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_Clown_. You have got rid of the vermin. Now amuse yourself in this garden. It\nis delightful with the passing of the cold weather.\n\n_King_ ( _sighing_ ). My friend, the proverb makes no mistake. Misfortune\nfinds the weak spot. See!\n\nNo sooner did the darkness lift  \n  That clouded memory\'s power,  \nThan the god of love prepared his bow  \n  And shot the mango-flower.\n\nNo sooner did the ring recall  \n  My banished maiden dear,  \nNo sooner do I vainly weep  \n  For her, than spring is here.\n\n_Clown_. Wait a minute, man. I will destroy Love\'s arrow with my stick. ( _He\nraises his stick and strikes at the mango branch_.)\n\n_King_ ( _smiling_ ). Enough! I see your pious power. My friend, where shall I\nsit now to comfort my eyes with the vines? They remind me somehow of her.\n\n_Clown_. Well, you told one of the maids, the clever painter,\n\np. 69\n\nthat you would spend this hour in the bower of spring-creepers. And you asked\nher to bring you there the picture of the lady Shakuntala which you painted on\na tablet.\n\n_King_. It is my only consolation. Lead the way to the bower of spring-\ncreepers.\n\n_Clown_. Follow me. ( _They walk about_. MISHRAKESHI _follows_.) Here is the\nbower of spring-creepers, with its jewelled benches. Its loneliness seems to\nbid you a silent welcome. Let us go in and sit down. (They do so.)\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. I will hide among the vines and see the dear girl\'s picture.\nThen I shall be able to tell her how deep her husband\'s love is. ( _She\nhides_.)\n\n_King_ ( _sighing_ ). I remember it all now, my friend. I told you how I first\nmet Shakuntala. It is true, you were not with me when I rejected her. But I\nhad told you of her at the first. Had you forgotten, as I did?\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. This shows that a king should not be separated a single moment\nfrom some intimate friend.\n\n_Clown_. No, I didn\'t forget. But when you had told the whole story, you said\nit was a joke and there was nothing in it. And I was fool enough to believe\nyou. No, this is the work of fate.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. It must be.\n\n_King_ ( _after meditating a moment_ ). Help me, my friend.\n\n_Clown_. But, man, this isn\'t right at all. A good man never lets grief get\nthe upper hand. The mountains are calm even in a tempest.\n\n_King_. My friend, I am quite forlorn. I keep thinking of her pitiful state\nwhen I rejected her. Thus:\n\nWhen I denied her, then she tried  \nTo join her people. "Stay," one cried,  \nHer father\'s representative.  \nShe stopped, she turned, she could but give  \nA tear-dimmed glance to heartless me--  \nThat arrow burns me poisonously.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. How his fault distresses him!\n\n_Clown_. Well, I don\'t doubt it was some heavenly being that carried her away.\n\n_King_. Who else would dare to touch a faithful wife? Her friends told me that\nMenaka was her mother. My heart\n\np. 70\n\npersuades me that it was she, or companions of hers, who carried Shakuntala\naway.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. His madness was wonderful, not his awakening reason.\n\n_Clown_. But in that case, you ought to take heart. You will meet her again.\n\n_King_. How so?\n\n_Clown_. Why, a mother or a father cannot long bear to see a daughter\nseparated from her husband.\n\n_King_. My friend,\n\nAnd was it phantom, madness, dream,  \n  Or fatal retribution stern?  \nMy hopes fell down a precipice  \n  And never, never will return.\n\n_Clown_. Don\'t talk that way. Why, the ring shows that incredible meetings do\nhappen.\n\n_King_ ( _looking at the ring_ ). This ring deserves pity. It has fallen from\na heaven hard to earn.\n\nYour virtue, ring, like mine,  \n  Is proved to be but small;  \nHer pink-nailed finger sweet  \n  You clasped. How could you fall?\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. If it were worn on any other hand, it would deserve pity. My\ndear girl, you are far away. I am the only one to hear these delightful words.\n\n_Clown_. Tell me how you put the ring on her finger.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. He speaks as if prompted by my curiosity.\n\n_King_. Listen, my friend. When I left the pious grove for the city, my\ndarling wept and said: "But how long will you remember us, dear?"\n\n_Clown_. And then you said------\n\n_King_. Then I put this engraved ring on her finger, and said to her-------\n\n_Clown_. Well, what?\n\n_King_.\n\nCount every day one letter of my name;  \n  Before you reach the end, dear,  \nWill come to lead you to my palace halls  \n  A guide whom I shall send, dear.\n\n[paragraph continues] Then, through my madness, it fell out cruelly.\n\np. 71\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. It was too charming an agreement to be frustrated by fate.\n\n_Clown_. But how did it get into a carp\'s mouth, as if it had been a fish-\nhook?\n\n_King_. While she was worshipping the Ganges at Shachitirtha, it fell.\n\n_Clown_. I see.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. That is why the virtuous king doubted his marriage with poor\nShakuntala. Yet such love does not ask for a token. How could it have been?\n\n_King_. Well, I can only reproach this ring.\n\n_Clown_ ( _smiling_ ). And I will reproach this stick of mine. Why are you\ncrooked when I am straight?\n\n_King_ ( _not hearing him_ ).\n\nHow could you fail to linger  \nOn her soft, tapering finger,  \n  And in the water fall?\n\n[paragraph continues] And yet\n\nThings lifeless know not beauty;  \nBut I--I scorned my duty,  \n  The sweetest task of all.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. He has given the answer which I had ready.\n\n_Clown_. But that is no reason why I should starve to death.\n\n_King_ ( _not heeding_ ). O my darling, my heart burns with repentance because\nI abandoned you without reason. Take pity on me. Let me see you again. (\n_Enter a maid with a tablet_.)\n\n_Maid_. Your Majesty, here is the picture of our lady. ( _She produces the\ntablet_.)\n\n_King_ ( _gazing at it_ ). It is a beautiful picture. See!\n\nA graceful arch of brows above great eyes;  \nLips bathed in darting, smiling light that flies  \nReflected from white teeth; a mouth as red  \nAs red karkandhu-fruit; love\'s brightness shed  \nO\'er all her face in bursts of liquid charm--  \nThe picture speaks, with living beauty warm.\n\n_Clown_ ( _looking at it_ ). The sketch is full of sweet meaning. My eyes seem\nto stumble over its uneven surface. What\n\np. 72\n\nmore can I say? I expect to see it come to life, and I feel like speaking to\nit.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. The king is a clever painter. I seem to see the dear girl\nbefore me.\n\n_King_. My friend,\n\nWhat in the picture is not fair,  \n  Is badly done;  \nYet something of her beauty there,  \n  I feel, is won.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. This is natural, when love is increased by remorse.\n\n_King_ ( _sighing_ ).\n\nI treated her with scorn and loathing ever;  \n  Now o\'er her pictured charms my heart will burst:  \nA traveller I, who scorned the mighty river,  \n  And seeks in the mirage to quench his thirst.\n\n_Clown_. There are three figures in the picture, and they are all beautiful.\nWhich one is the lady Shakuntala?\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. The poor fellow never saw her beauty. His eyes are useless, for\nshe never came before them.\n\n_King_. Which one do you think?\n\n_Clown_ ( _observing closely_ ). I think it is this one, leaning against the\ncreeper which she has just sprinkled. Her face is hot and the flowers are\ndropping from her hair; for the ribbon is loosened. Her arms droop like weary\nbranches; she has loosened her girdle, and she seems a little fatigued. This,\nI think, is the lady Shakuntala, the others are her friends.\n\n_King_. You are good at guessing. Besides, here are proofs of my love.\n\nSee where discolorations faint  \n  Of loving handling tell;  \nAnd here the swelling of the paint  \n  Shows where my sad tears fell.\n\n[paragraph continues] Chaturika, I have not finished the background. Go, get\nthe brushes.\n\n_Maid_. Please hold the picture, Madhavya, while I am gone.\n\np. 73\n\n_King_. I will hold it. ( _He does so. Exit maid_.)\n\n_Clown_. What are you going to add?\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. Surely, every spot that the dear girl loved.\n\n_King_. Listen, my friend.\n\nThe stream of Malini, and on its sands  \nThe swan-pairs resting; holy foot-hill lands  \nOf great Himalaya\'s sacred ranges, where  \nThe yaks are seen; and under trees that bear  \nBark hermit-dresses on their branches high,  \nA doe that on the buck\'s horn rubs her eye.\n\n_Clown_ ( _aside_ ). To hear him talk, I should think he was going to fill up\nthe picture with heavy-bearded hermits.\n\n_King_. And another ornament that Shakuntala loved I have forgotten to paint.\n\n_Clown_. What?\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. Something natural for a girl living in the forest.\n\n_King_.\n\nThe siris-blossom, fastened o\'er her ear,  \n  Whose stamens brush her cheek;  \nThe lotus-chain like autumn moonlight soft  \n  Upon her bosom meek.\n\n_Clown_. But why does she cover her face with fingers lovely as the pink\nwater-lily? She seems frightened. ( _He looks more closely_.) I see. Here is a\nbold, bad bee. He steals honey, and so he flies to her lotus-face.\n\n_King_. Drive him away.\n\n_Clown_. It is your affair to punish evil-doers.\n\n_King_. True. O welcome guest of the flowering vine, why do you waste your\ntime in buzzing here?\n\nYour faithful, loving queen,  \n  Perched on a flower, athirst,  \nIs waiting for you still,  \n  Nor tastes the honey first.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. A gentlemanly way to drive him off!\n\n_Clown_. This kind are obstinate, even when you warn them.\n\n_King_ ( _angrily_ ). Will you not obey my command? Then listen:\n\np. 74\n\n\'Tis sweet as virgin blossoms on a tree,  \nThe lip I kissed in love-feasts tenderly;  \nSting that dear lip, O bee, with cruel power,  \nAnd you shall be imprisoned in a flower.\n\n_Clown_. Well, he doesn\'t seem afraid of your dreadful punishment. (\n_Laughing. To himself_.) The man is crazy, and I am just as bad, from\nassociating with him.\n\n_King_. Will he not go, though I warn him?\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. Love works a curious change even in a brave man.\n\n_Clown_ ( _aloud_ ). It is only a picture, man.\n\n_King_. A picture?\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. I too understand it now. But to him, thoughts are real\nexperiences.\n\n_King_. You have done an ill-natured thing.\n\nWhen I was happy in the sight,  \n  And when my heart was warm,  \nYou brought sad memories back, and made  \n  My love a painted form. ( _He sheds a tear_.)\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. Fate plays strangely with him.\n\n_King_. My friend, how can I endure a grief that has no respite?\n\nI cannot sleep at night  \n  And meet her dreaming;  \nI cannot see the sketch  \n  While tears are streaming.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. My friend, you have indeed atoned--and in her friend\'s presence\n--for the pain you caused by rejecting dear Shakuntala. ( _Enter the maid_\nCHATURIKA.)\n\n_Maid_. Your Majesty, I was coming back with the box of paint-brushes\n\n_King_. Well?\n\n_Maid_. I met Queen Vasumati with the maid Pingalika. And the queen snatched\nthe box from me, saying: "I will take it to the king myself."\n\n_Clown_. How did you escape?\n\n_Maid_. The queen\'s dress caught on a vine. And while her maid was setting her\nfree, I excused myself in a hurry.\n\np. 75\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. Follow me, your Majesty.\n\n_Clown_ ( _listening_ ). Man, the she-tiger of the palace is making a spring\non her prey. She means to make one mouthful of the maid.\n\n_King_. My friend, the queen has come because she feels touched in her honour.\nYou had better take care of this picture.\n\n_Clown_. "And yourself," you might add. ( _He takes the picture and rises_.)\nIf you get out of the trap alive, call for me at the Cloud Balcony. And I will\nhide the thing there so that nothing but a pigeon could find it. ( _Exit on\nthe run_.)\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. Though his heart is given to another, he is courteous to his\nearly flame. He is a constant friend. ( _Enter the portress with a document_.)\n\n_Portress_. Victory to your Majesty.\n\n_King_. Vetravati, did you not meet Queen Vasumati?\n\n_Portress_. Yes, your Majesty. But she turned back when she saw that I carried\na document.\n\n_King_. The queen knows times and seasons. She will not interrupt business.\n\n_Portress_. Your Majesty, the minister sends word that in the press of various\nbusiness he has attended to only one citizen\'s suit. This he has reduced to\nwriting for your Majesty\'s perusal.\n\n_King_. Give me the document. ( _The portress does so_.)\n\n_King_ ( _reads_ ). "Be it known to his Majesty. A seafaring merchant named\nDhanavriddhi has been lost in a shipwreck. He is childless, and his property,\namounting to several millions, reverts to the crown. Will his Majesty take\naction?" ( _Sadly_.) It is dreadful to be childless. Vetravati, he had great\nriches. There must be several wives. Let inquiry be made. There may be a wife\nwho is with child.\n\n_Portress_. We have this moment heard that a merchant\'s daughter of Saketa is\nhis wife. And she is soon to become a mother.\n\n_King_. The child shall receive the inheritance. Go, inform the minister.\n\n_Portress_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _She starts to go_.)\n\n_King_. Wait a moment.\n\n_Portress_ ( _turning back_ ). Yes, your Majesty.\n\np. 76\n\n_King_. After all, what does it matter whether he have issue or not?\n\nLet King Dushyanta be proclaimed  \n  To every sad soul kin  \nThat mourns a kinsman loved and lost,  \n  Yet did not plunge in sin.\n\n_Portress_. The proclamation shall be made. ( _She goes out and soon\nreturns_.) Your Majesty, the royal proclamation was welcomed by the populace\nas is a timely shower.\n\n_King_ ( _sighing deeply_ ). Thus, when issue fails, wealth passes, on the\ndeath of the head of the family, to a stranger. When I die, it will be so with\nthe glory of Puru\'s line.\n\n_Portress_. Heaven avert the omen!\n\n_King_. Alas! I despised the happiness that offered itself to me.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. Without doubt, he has dear Shakuntala in mind when he thus\nreproaches himself.\n\n_King_.\n\nCould I forsake the virtuous wife  \nWho held my best, my future life  \nAnd cherished it for glorious birth,  \nAs does the seed-receiving earth?\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. She will not long be forsaken.\n\n_Maid_ ( _to the portress_ ). Mistress, the minister\'s report has doubled our\nlord\'s remorse. Go to the Cloud Balcony and bring Madhavya to dispel his\ngrief.\n\n_Portress_. A good suggestion. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_King_. Alas! The ancestors of Dushyanta are in a doubtful case.\n\nFor I am childless, and they do not know,  \n  When I am gone, what child of theirs will bring  \nThe scriptural oblation; and their tears  \n  Already mingle with my offering.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. He is screened from the light, and is in darkness.\n\n_Maid_. Do not give way to grief, your Majesty. You are in the prime of your\nyears, and the birth of a son to one of your other wives will make you\nblameless-before your ancestors. ( _To herself_.) He does not heed me. The\nproper medicine is needed for any disease.\n\np. 77\n\n_King_ ( _betraying his sorrow_ ). Surely,\n\nThe royal line that flowed  \n  A river pure and grand,  \nDies in the childless king,  \n  Like streams in desert sand.\n\n( _He swoons_.)\n\n_Maid_ ( _in distress_ ). Oh, sir, come to yourself.\n\n_Mishrakeshi_. Shall I make him happy now? No, I heard the mother of the gods\nconsoling Shakuntala. She said that the gods, impatient for the sacrifice,\nwould soon cause him to welcome his true wife. I must delay no longer. I will\ncomfort dear Shakuntala with my tidings. (Exit through the air.)\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. Help, help!\n\n_King_ ( _comes to himself and listens_ ). It sounds as if Madhavya were in\ndistress.\n\n_Maid_. Your Majesty, I hope that Pingalika and the other maids did not catch\npoor Madhavya with the picture in his hands.\n\n_King_. Go, Chaturika. Reprove the queen in my name for not controlling her\nservants.\n\n_Maid_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_The voice_. Help, help!\n\n_King_. The Brahman\'s voice seems really changed by fear. Who waits without? (\n_Enter the chamberlain_.)\n\n_Chamberlain_. Your Majesty commands?\n\n_King_. See why poor Madhavya is screaming so.\n\n_Chamberlain_. I will see. ( _He goes out, and returns trembling_.)\n\n_King_. Parvatayana, I hope it is nothing very dreadful.\n\n_Chamberlain_. I hope not.\n\n_King_. Then why do you tremble so? For\n\nWhy should the trembling, born  \n  Of age, increasing, seize  \nYour limbs and bid them shake  \n  Like fig-leaves in the breeze?\n\n_Chamberlain_. Save your friend, O King!\n\n_King_. From what?\n\n_Chamberlain_. From great danger.\n\n_King_. Speak plainly, man.\n\np. 78\n\n_Chamberlain_. On the Cloud Balcony, open to the four winds of heaven------\n\n_King_. What has happened there?\n\n_Chamberlain_.\n\nWhile he was resting on its height,  \nWhich palace peacocks in their flight  \nCan hardly reach, he seemed to be  \nSnatched up--by what, we could not see.\n\n_King_ ( _rising quickly_ ). My very palace is invaded by evil creatures. To\nbe a king, is to be a disappointed man.\n\nThe moral stumblings of mine own,  \nThe daily slips, are scarcely known;  \nWho then that rules a kingdom, can  \nGuide every deed of every man?\n\n_The voice_. Hurry, hurry!\n\n_King_ ( _hears the voice and quickens his steps_ ). Have no fear, my friend.\n\n_The voice_. Have no fear! When something has got me by the back of the neck,\nand is trying to break my bones like a piece of sugar-cane!\n\n_King_ ( _looks about_ ). A bow! a bow! ( _Enter a Greek woman with a bow_.)\n\n_Greek woman_. A bow and arrows, your Majesty. And here are the finger-guards.\n( _The king takes the bow and arrows_.)\n\n_Another voice behind the scenes_.\n\nWrithe, while I drink the red blood flowing clear  \nAnd kill you, as a tiger kills a deer;  \nLet King Dushyanta grasp his bow; but how  \nCan all his kingly valour save you now?\n\n_King_ ( _angrily_ ). He scorns me, too! In one moment, miserable demon, you\nshall die. ( _Stringing his bow_.) Where is the stairway, Parvatayana?\n\n_Chamberlain_. Here, your Majesty. ( _All make haste_.)\n\n_King_ ( _looking about_ ). There is no one here.\n\n_The Clown\'s voice_. Save me, save me! I see you, if you can\'t see me. I am a\nmouse in the claws of the cat. I am done for.\n\np. 79\n\n_King_. You are proud of your invisibility. But shall not my arrow see you?\nStand still. Do not hope to escape by clinging to my friend.\n\nMy arrow, flying when the bow is bent,  \nShall slay the wretch and spare the innocent;  \nWhen milk is mixed with water in a cup,  \nSwans leave the water, and the milk drink up.\n\n( _He takes aim. Enter_ MATALI _and the clown_.)\n\n_Matali_. O King, as Indra, king of the gods, commands,\n\nSeek foes among the evil powers alone;  \n  For them your bow should bend;  \nNot cruel shafts, but glances soft and kind  \n  Should fall upon a friend.\n\n_King_ ( _hastily withdrawing the arrow_ ). It is Matali. Welcome to the\ncharioteer of heaven\'s king.\n\n_Clown_. Well! He came within an inch of butchering me. And you welcome him.\n\n_Matali_ ( _smiling_ ). Hear, O King, for what purpose Indra sends me to you.\n\n_King_. I am all attention.\n\n_Matali_. There is a host of demons who call themselves Invincible--the brood\nof Kalanemi.\n\n_King_. So Narada has told me.\n\n_Matali_.\n\nHeaven\'s king is powerless; you shall smite  \n  His foes in battle soon;  \nDarkness that overcomes the day,  \n  Is scattered by the moon.\n\n[paragraph continues] Take your bow at once, enter my heavenly chariot, and\nset forth for victory.\n\n_King_. I am grateful for the honour which Indra shows me. But why did you act\nthus toward Madhavya?\n\n_Matali_. I will tell you. I saw that you were overpowered by some inner\nsorrow, and acted thus to rouse you. For\n\nThe spurned snake will swell his hood;  \n  Fire blazes when \'tis stirred;  \nBrave men are roused to fighting mood  \n  By some insulting word.\n\np. 80\n\n_King_. Friend Madhavya, I must obey the bidding of heaven\'s king. Go,\nacquaint the minister Pishuna with the matter, and add these words of mine:\n\nYour wisdom only shall control  \n  The kingdom for a time;  \nMy bow is strung; a distant goal  \n  Calls me, and tasks sublime.\n\n_Clown_. Very well. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_Matali_. Enter the chariot. ( _The king does so. Exeunt omnes_.)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act VII](sha11.htm)\n\n'
