He recites the hymn, asat su me _g_ arita _h_ sabhivega _h_ (Rv. X, 27,\n1), (and in. it the word) satyadhv _ri_ tam, the destroyer of truth. Verily,\nthat day\n\np. 169\n\nis truth, and as endowed with the word satya, truth, the form of this day is\nperfect 1.\n\n2\\. That hymn is composed by Vasukra. Verily, Vasukra is Brahman, and that day\nis Brahman. Thus he obtains Brahman by means of Brahman 2.\n\n3\\. Here they say: 'Why then is that Marutvatiya, hymn completed by the hymn\nof Vasukra?' Surely because no other _Ri_ shi but Vasukra brought out a\nMarutvatiya hymn, or divided it properly 3. Therefore that Marutvatiya hymn is\ncompleted by the hymn of Vasukra.\n\n4\\. That hymn, asat su me, is not definitely addressed to any deity, and is\ntherefore supposed to be addressed to Pra _g_ apati. Verily, Pra _g_ apati is\nindefinite, and therefore the hymn serves to win Pra _g_ apati.\n\n5\\. Once in the hymn (Rv. X, 27, 22) he defines Indra (indraya sunvat);\ntherefore it does not fall off from its form, as connected with Indra.\n\n6\\. He recites the hymn (Rv. VI, 17, 1) piba somam abhi yam ugra tarda _h_.\n\n7\\. In the verse urvam gavyam mahi g _ri_ _n_ ana indra the word mahi, great,\noccurs. Endowed with the word mahat, the form of this day is perfect.\n\n8\\. That hymn is composed by Bharadva _g_ a, and Bharadva _g_ a was he who\nknew most, who lived longest, and performed the greatest austerities among the\n_Ri_ shis, and by this hymn he drove away evil. Therefore if he recites the\nhymn of Bharadva _g_ a,\n\np. 170\n\nthen, after having driven away evil, he becomes learned, long-lived, and full\nof austerities.\n\n9\\. He recites the hymn kaya subha savayasa _h_ sanila _h_ (Rv. I, 165, 1).\n\n10\\. In the verse a _s_ asate prati haryanty uktha (Rv. I, 165, 4) the word\nuktha occurs. Verily, that day (the mahavrata) is uktha (hymn). Endowed with\nthe word uktha, the form of this day becomes perfect.\n\n11\\. That hymn is called Kaya _s_ ubhiya 1. Verily, that hymn, which is called\nKaya _s_ ubhiya, is mutual understanding and it is lasting. By means of it\nIndra, Agastya, and the Maruts came to a mutual understanding. Therefore, if\nhe recites the Kaya _s_ ubhiya hymn, it serves for mutual understanding.\n\n12\\. The same hymn is also long life. Therefore, if the sacrificer is dear to\nthe Hot _ri_ , let him recite the Kaya _s_ ubhiya hymn for him.\n\n13\\. He recites the hymn marutva _n_ indra v _ri_ shabo ra _n_ aya (Rv. III,\n47, 1).\n\n14\\. In it the words indra v _ri_ shabha (powerful) occur. Verily, powerful is\na form of Indra 2, this day belongs to Indra, and this is the perfect form of\nthat day.\n\n15\\. That hymn is composed by Vi _s_ vamitra. Verily, Vi _s_ vamitra was the\nfriend (mitra) of all (vi _s_ va).\n\n16\\. Everybody is the friend of him who knows this, and for whom a Hot _ri_\npriest who knows this, recites this hymn.\n\n17\\. The next hymn, _g_ anish _th_ a ugra _h_ sahase turaya (Rv. I, 73, 1),\nforms a Nividdhana 3, and,\n\np. 171\n\naccording to the one-day (ekaha) ceremonial, is perfect in form. On that day\nmuch is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be atoned for (by\nrecitation of hymns). Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at\nthe end of the year (on the last day but one of the sacrifice that lasts a\nwhole year) the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest.\n\nHe who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot _ri_ priest who\nknows this, recites this hymn 1.\n\n18\\. These, if recited straight on, are ninety-seven verses 2. The ninety are\nthree Vira _g_ , each consisting of thirty, and then the seven verses which\nare over. Whatever is the praise of the seven, is the praise of ninety also.\n\np. 172\n\n19\\. By repeating the first and last verses three times each, they become one\nhundred and one verses.\n\n20\\. There are five fingers, of four joints each, two pits (in the elbow and\nthe arm), the arm, the eye, the shoulder-blade; this makes twenty-five. The\nother three parts have likewise twenty-five each 1. That makes a hundred, and\nthe trunk is the one hundred and first.\n\n21\\. Hundred is life, health, strength, brightness. The sacrificer as the one\nhundred and first rests in life, health, strength, and brightness.\n\n22\\. These verses become Trish _t_ ubh 2, for the noonday-libation consists of\nTrish _t_ ubh verses.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[168:6](sbe01185.htm#fr_409) The type after which the Marutvatiya- _s_ astra\nis to be performed is the _K_ aturvi _m_ sa day. Hitherto (from a tva ratham\nto naki _h_ sudasa _h_ ), all that is taken over from the type to the\nmodification, i. e. the Marutvatiya, has been explained. Now follow the verses\nwhich are new and peculiar to the Marutvatiya of the Mahavrata.\n\n[169:1](sbe01185.htm#fr_410) The commentator endeavours to make the meaning\nmore natural by taking in the word prahanta, he who kills the destroyer of\ntruth. But considering the general character of these remarks, this is hardly\nnecessary.\n\n[169:2](sbe01185.htm#fr_411) Cf. I, 1, 3, 3.\n\n[169:3](sbe01185.htm#fr_412) By separating the first t _ri_ _k_ a from the\nsecond, and so forth.\n\n[170:1](sbe01185.htm#fr_413) Cf. Ait. Brahm. V, 16.\n\n[170:2](sbe01185.htm#fr_414) Cf. Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 2, 1, 8.\n\n[170:3](sbe01185.htm#fr_415) The hymn consists of eleven verses. In the\nmiddle, after the sixth verse, nivids or invocations, such as indro marutvan,\nare inserted, and therefore it is called a nividdhana hymn.\n\n[171:1](sbe01185.htm#fr_416) With this hymn the Marutvatiya- _s_ astra is\nfinished. All the hymns from a tva ratham to asat su me _g_ aritar are simply\ntaken over from the _K_ aturvi _m_ sa ceremonial, the rest are peculiar to the\nMahavrata day, the day preceding the Udayaniya or final day of the Gavamayana\nsattra. All this is more fully described in the fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka (V, 1, 1,\n8), containing the Sutras or rules of _S_ aunaka, while the earlier \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyakas are reckoned as Brahma _n_ as, and are therefore mixed up with matters\nnot actually required for the performance of the sacrifice.\n\n[171:2](sbe01185.htm#fr_417)\n\nThe first Stotriya and \xc3\x82nurupa t _ri_ _k_ as =\n\n|\n\n6 (I, 2, 1, 1).  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nThe six Pragathas, each of 2 verses raised to 3 (but the text gives seven\nPragathas) =\n\n|\n\n18 (I, 2, 1, 3; 4; 5; 6; 11; 12; 13).  \n  \nThree Dhayyas =\n\n|\n\n3 (I, 2, 1, 7; 8; 9).  \n  \nAsat su =\n\n|\n\n24 (I, 2, 2, 1).  \n  \nPiba somam =\n\n|\n\n15 (I,2,2,6).  \n  \nKaya _s_ ubha =\n\n|\n\n15 (I, 2,2,9).  \n  \nMarutva _n_ indra =\n\n|\n\n5 (I, 2, 2, 13).  \n  \n_G_ anish _th_ a ugra _h_ =\n\n|\n\n_11_ (1, 2, 2, 17).  \n  \n(TOTAL)\n\n|\n\n_97_  \n  \n\n\n[172:1](sbe01185.htm#fr_418) The left side as well as the right, and then the\nleft and right side of the lower body. Thus we have twenty joints of the five\ntoes, a thigh, a leg, and three joints, making twenty-five on each side.\n\n[172:2](sbe01185.htm#fr_419) Approach the Trish _t_ ubh metre of the last\nhymn.
