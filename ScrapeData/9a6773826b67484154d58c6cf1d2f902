On the Ash _t_ aka festivals, of which\nsome texts reckon three, while others have four, comp. Weber, Naxatra (second\narticle), pp. 337, 341 seq.; Buhler, S.B.E., II, p. 214; Ludwig, Rig-veda,\nvol. iv, pp. 424 seq.; Atharva-veda III, 10. The last Ash _t_ aka, which is\ncelebrated in the dark fortnight of Magha, is called Ekash _t_ aka; this Ash\n_t_ aka is called the \'wife of the year,\' \'the image of the year,\' \'the\ndisposer of the days.\' If the Phalguna month is reckoned as the first of the\nyear, this Ash _t_ aka precedes the year\'s beginning only by a few days; there\nare also some Vedic passages which point to the Ekash _t_ aka\'s following\nshortly after the beginning of the year; see Weber, loc. cit., p. 342.\n\n[102:3](sbe29060.htm#fr_224) Instead of navak _ri_ t the parallel texts\n(except the Mantrabrahma _n_ a II, 2, 12) have navagat, which is explained by\nnutanavivahavati (Ludwig, loc. cit.); the \'three powers\' are understood by\nMadhava (in the commentary on Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 3, 11) as Agni, Surya, and\n_K_ andra.\n\n[102:5](sbe29060.htm#fr_225) After pavamana _h_ there is evidently a word\nwanting that p. 103 indicated the limb of the Ash _t_ aka\'s body identified\nwith the months and half-months.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 13](sbe29061.htm)\n\n'
