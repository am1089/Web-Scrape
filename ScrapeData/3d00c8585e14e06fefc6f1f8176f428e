(A student) shall mutter the morning prayer standing, and the evening\nprayer sitting.\n\n4\\.

The sense of this injunction, according to Nand., is, that he must not\npronounce any bathing Mantras. But more probably it {footnote p. 117} is\nmeant, that he shall swim motionless like a stick (see \xc3\x82past. I, 1, 2, 30,\nwith Dr. Buhler's note). According to a third explanation, which is mentioned\nboth by Haradatta and by Devapala in his Commentary on the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_\nhya-sutra, the sense would be, that he is not allowed, while bathing, to rub\nhis skin, in order to clean himself with bathing powder and the like.]\n\np. 117\n\n6\\. Let him study when called (by his teacher).\n\n7\\. He shall act so as to please his Guru (spiritual teacher) and to be\nserviceable to him.\n\n8\\. He shall wear his girdle, his staff, his skin, and his sacrificial string.\n\n9\\. He shall go begging at the houses of virtuous persons, excepting those of\nhis Guru's (and of his own) relatives.\n\n10\\. He may eat (every morning and evening) some of the food collected by\nbegging, after having received permission to do so from his Guru.\n\n11\\. He must avoid _S_ raddhas, factitious salt, food turned sour[1], stale\nfood, dancing, singing, women, honey, meat, ointments, remnants of the food\n(of other persons than his teacher), the killing of living beings, and rude\nspeeches.\n\n12.. He must occupy a low couch.\n\n13\\. He must rise before his Guru and go to rest after him.\n\n14\\. He must salute his Guru, after having performed his morning devotion.\n\n15\\. Let him embrace his feet with crossed hands.\n\n[11. 1 Nand. interprets _s_ ukta, 'food turned sour,' by 'rude speeches,'\nbecause if taken in its other meaning, it would be included in the next term,\nparyushita, 'stale food.' However, if Nand.'s interpretation were followed, it\nwould coincide with the last term of this enumeration, a _s_ lila, 'rude\nspeeches;' and its position between two articles of food renders the above\ninterpretation more plausible.]\n\np. 118\n\n16\\. The right foot with his right hand, and the left foot with his left.\n\n17\\. After the salutation (abhivadaye, 'I salute') he must mention his own\nname and add the word 'bhos' (Venerable Sir) at the end of his address.\n\n18\\. He must not speak to his Guru while he is himself standing, or sitting,\nor lying, or eating, or averting his face.\n\n19\\. And let him speak, if his teacher sits, standing up; if he walks,\nadvancing towards him; if he is coming near, meeting him; if he runs, running\nafter him;\n\n20\\. If his face is averted, turning round so as to face him;\n\n21\\. If he is at some distance, approaching him;\n\n22\\. If he is in a reclining position, bending to him;\n\n23\\. Let him not sit in a careless attitude (such as e. g. having a cloth tied\nround his legs and knees, while sitting on his hams) before the eyes of his\nteacher,\n\n24\\. Neither must he pronounce his mere name (without adding to it the word\n_S_ ri or a similar term at the beginning).\n\n25\\. He must not mimic his gait, his manner, his speech, and so on.\n\n26\\. Where his Guru is censured or foully belied, there let him not stay.\n\n27\\. Nor must he sit on the same seat with him,\n\n28\\. Unless it be on a rock[1], on a wooden bench, in a boat, or in a\ncarriage.\n\n[28. 1 Thus according to Kulluka, (on M. II, 204). Nand. takes the term _s_\nilaphalaka as a compound denoting a stone seat.']\n\np. 119\n\n29\\. If his teacher's teacher is near, let him behave towards him as if he\nwere his own teacher.\n\n30\\. He must nor salute his own Gurus without his teacher's leave.\n\n31\\. Let him behave towards the son of his teacher, who teaches him the Veda,\nas towards his teacher, even though he be younger or of an equal age with\nhimself;\n\n32\\. But he must not wash his feet,\n\n33\\. Nor eat the leaving of his food.\n\n34\\. Thus let him acquire by heart one Veda, or two Vedas, or (all) the Vedas.\n\n35\\. Thereupon, the Veda _n_ gas (that treating of phonetics and the rest)[1].\n\n36\\. He who, not having studied the Veda, applies himself to another study,\nwill degrade himself, and his progeny with him, to the state of a _S_ udra.\n\n37\\. From the mother is the first birth; the second, from the girding with the\nsacrificial string.\n\n38\\. In the latter, the Savitri hymn is his mother, and the teacher his\nfather.\n\n39\\. It is this which entitles members of the three higher castes to the\ndesignation of 'the twice-born.'\n\n40\\. Previous to his being girded with the sacrificial string, a member of\nthese castes is similar to a _S_ udra (and not allowed to study the Veda).\n\n[30. Nand. here interprets Guru by 'a paternal uncle and the rest.'\n\n31\\. This rule refers to a son of his spiritual teacher, who teaches him one\nor two chapters of the Veda, while the teacher himself is gone out for bathing\nor some such reason. Va, 'or,' is added in order to include a son of the\nteacher, who is himself a pupil, as Manu (II, 208) says. (Nand.)\n\n35\\. 1 See Max Muller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 108 seq.\n\n38\\. 1 Rig-Veda, III, 62, 10.]\n\np. 120\n\n41\\. A student shall shave all his hair, or wear it tied in one lock.\n\n42\\. After having mastered the Veda, let him take leave of his teacher and\nbathe, after having presented, him with a gift.\n\n43\\. Or let him spend the remainder of his life at his teacher's house.\n\n44\\. If, while he is living there, his teacher should die, let him behave to\nhis teacher's son as towards his teacher himself;\n\n45\\. Or[1] towards one of his wives, who is equal to him in caste.\n\n46\\. On failure of such, let him pay homage to the fire, and live as a\nperpetual student.\n\n47\\. A Brahma _n_ a who passes thus without tiring (of the discharge of his\nduties) the time of his studentship will attain to the most exalted heavenly\nabode (that of Brahman) after his death, and will not be born again in this\nworld.\n\n48\\. A voluntary effusion of the semen by a twice-born youth (in sexual\nintercourse with a woman), during the period of his studentship, has been\npronounced a transgression of the rule prescribed for students by expounders\nof the Vedas well acquainted with the system of duties.\n\n49\\. Having loaded himself with that crime, be must go begging to seven\nhouses, clothed only with the skin of an ass, and proclaiming his deed.\n\n[42. After the solemn bath (see \xc3\x82 _s_ v. III, 8, 9; Gobh. III, 4; Par. II, 6;\n_S_ a _n_ kh. III, 1), which terminates the period of studentship, the\nstudent, who is henceforth called Snataka, 'one who has bathed,' is allowed to\nreturn home.\n\n45\\. 'According to Nand., the particle va, 'or,' is used in order to include\nanother alternative, that of living with an old fellow-student, as directed by\nGautama, III, 8.]\n\np. 121\n\n50\\. Eating once a day only a meal consisting of the alms obtained at those\n(houses), and bathing at the three Savanas (dawn, noon, and evening), he will\nbe absolved from guilt at the end of the year.\n\n51\\. After an involuntary effusion of the semen during sleep, a twice-born\nstudent must bathe (on the next morning), worship the sun (by offerings of\nperfumes and the like), and mutter three times the Mantra, 'Again shall my\nstrength return to me[1].'\n\n52\\. He who for seven days omits to collect alms and to kindle the sacred\nfire, must perform the penance of an Avakir _n_ in (breaker of his vow),\nprovided that he has not been prevented from the discharge of his duties by an\nillness.\n\n53\\. If the sun should rise or set while a student is purposely indulging in\nsleep, ignoring (the precepts of law), he must fast for a day, muttering (the\nGayatri one thousand and eight times).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXIX.](sbe07031.htm)\n\n"
