 \nOur ruler on his throne install,  \nAnd with thy presence cheer us all.\'  \n   Then, skilled in lore and arts that guide  \nThe speaker, Raghu\'s son replied:  \n\'For fourteen years I might not break  \nThe mandate that my father spake;  \nNor can I, till that time be fled,  \nThe street of town or village tread.  \nLet King Sugriva seek the town  \nMost worthy of her high renown,  \nThere let him be without delay  \nAnointed, and begin his sway.  \n   This answered, to Sugriva then  \nThus spake anew the king of men:  \n\'Do thou who knowest right ordain  \nPrince Angad consort of thy reign;  \nFor he is noble, true, and bold,  \nAnd trained a righteous course to hold  \nGifts like his sire\'s thait youth adorn  \nBorn eldest to the eldest born.  \n\np. 356  \n\nThis is the month of Sravana 1first  \nOf those that see the rain-clouds burst.  \nFour months, thou knowest well, extends  \nThe season when the rain descends.  \nNo time for deeds of war is this.  \nSeek thou thy fair metropolis,  \nAnd I with Lakshman, O my friend,  \nThe time upon this hill will spend.  \nAn ample cavern opens there  \nMade lovely by the mountain air,  \nAnd lotuses and lilies fill  \nThe pleasant lake and murmuring rill.  \nWhen Kartik\'s  2 month shall clear the skies,  \nThen tempt the mighty enterprise.  \nNow, chieftain to thy home repair,  \nAnd be anointed sovereign there.\'  \n\nSugriva heard: he bowed his head:  \nWithin the lovely town he sped  \nWhich Bali\'s royal will had swayed,  \nWhere thousand Vanar chiefs arrayed  \nGathered in order round their king,  \nAnd led him on with welcoming.  \nLow on the earth the lesser crowd  \nFell in prostration as they bowed.  \nSugriva looked with grateful eyes,  \nSpake to them all and bade them rise.  \nThen through the royal bowers he strode  \nWherein the monarch\'s wives abode.  \nSoon from the inner chambers came  \nThe Vanar of exalted fame;  \nAnd joyful friends drew near and shed  \nKing-making balm upon his head,  \nLike Gods anointing in the skies  \nTheir sovereign of the thousand eyes.  3  \nThen brought they, o\'er their king to hold  \nThe white umbrella decked with gold,  \nAnd chouries with their waving hair  \nIn golden handles wondrous fair;  \nAnd fragrant herbs and seed and spice,  \nAnd sparkling gems exceeding price,  \nAnd every bloom from woods and leas,  \n\nAnd gum distilled from milky trees;  \nAnd precious ointment white as milk,  \nAnd spotless robes of cloth and silk,  \nWreaths of sweet flowers whose glories gleam  \nIn grassy grove, on lake or stream.  \nAnd fragrant sandal and each scent  \nThat makes the soft breeze redolent;  \nGrain, honey, odorous seed, and store  \nOf oil and curd and golden ore;  \nA noble tiger\'s skin, a pair  \nOf sandals wrought with costliest care,  \nEight pairs of damsels drawing nigh  \nBrought unguents stained with varied dye.  \nThen gems and cates and robes displayed  \nBefore the twice-born priests were laid,  \nThat they would deign in order due  \nTo consecrate the king anew.  \nThe sacred grass was duly spread  \nAnd sacrificial flame was fed,  \nWhich Scripture-learned priests supplied  \nWith oil which texts had sanctified.  \nThen, with all rites ordained of old,  \nHigh on the terrace bright with gold,  \nWhereon a glorious carpet lay,  \nAnd fresh-culled garlands sweet and gay,  \nPlaced on his throne, Sugriva bent  \nHis looks toward the Orient.  \nIn horns from forehead of the bull.  \nIn pitchers bright and beautiful,  \nIn urns of gold the Vanara took  \nPure water brought from stream and brook,  \nFrom every consecrated strand  \nAnd every sea that beats the land.  \nThen, as prescribed by sacred lore  \nAnd many a mighty sage of yore,  1b  \nThe leaders of the Vanars poured  \nThe sacred water on their lord.  2b  \nFrom every Vanar at the close  \nOf that imperial rite arose  \nShouts of glad triumph, loud and long  \nRepeated by the high-souled throng.  \nSugriva, when the rite was done,  \nObeyed the hest of Raghu\'s son.  \nPrince Angad to his breast he strained.  \nAnd partner of his sway ordained.  \nOnce more from all the host rang out  \nThe loud huzza and jovful shout.  \n\'Well done! well done!\' each Vanar cried.  \nAnd good Sugriva glorified.  \n\np. 357  \n\nThen with glad voices loudly raised  \nWere Rama and his brother praised;  \nAnd bright Kishkindha shone that day  \nWith happy throngs and banners gay.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[356:1](ry300.htm#fr_613) S\'ravan: July-August.
