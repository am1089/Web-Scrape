Not so, on account of the impossibility in one.\n\nThe Bauddhas have been refuted. As now the _G_ ainas also hold the view of the\nworld originating from atoms and similar views, their theory is reviewed next.\n--The _G_ ainas hold that the world comprises souls ( _g_ iva), and non-souls\n(a _g_ iva), and that there is no Lord. The world further comprises six\nsubstances (dravya), viz. souls ( _g_ iva), merit (dharma), demerit (adharma),\nbodies (pudgala), time (kala), and space (aka _s_ a). The souls are of three\ndifferent kinds-bound (in the state of bondage), perfected by Yoga\n(Yogasiddha), and released (mukta). 'Merit' is that particular world-pervading\nsubstance which is the cause of the motion of all things moving; 'demerit' is\nthat all-pervading substance which is the cause of stationariness, 'Body' is\nthat substance which possesses colour, smell, taste, and touch. It is of two\nkinds, atomic or compounded of atoms; to the latter kind belong wind, fire,\nwater, earth, the bodies of living creatures, and so on. 'Time' is a\nparticular atomic substance which is the cause of the current distinction of\npast, present, and future. 'Space' is one, and of infinite extent. From among\nthese substances those which are not atomic are comprehended under the term\n'the five astikayas (existing bodies)'--the astikaya of souls, the astikaya of\nmerit, the astikaya of demerit, the astikaya of matter, the astikaya of space.\nThis term 'astikaya' is applied to\n\np. 517\n\nsubstances occupying several parts of space.--They also use another division\nof categories which subserves the purpose of Release; distinguishing souls,\nnon-souls, influx (asrava), bondage, ni _g_ ara, sa _m_ vara, and Release.\n_Release_ comprises the means of Release also, viz. perfect knowledge, good\nconduct, and so on. The soul is that which has knowledge, seeing, pleasure,\nstrength (virya) for its qualities. Non-soul is the aggregate of the things\nenjoyed by the souls. 'Influx' is whatever is instrumental towards the souls\nhaving the fruition of objects, viz. the sense-organs, and so on.--Bondage is\nof eight different kinds, comprising the four ghatikarman, and the four\naghatikarman. The former term denotes whatever obstructs the essential\nqualities of the soul, viz. knowledge, intuition, strength, pleasure; the\nlatter whatever causes pleasure, pain, and indifference, which are due to the\npersistence of the wrong imagination that makes the soul identify itself with\nits body.--'Decay' means the austerities (tapas), known from the teaching of\nthe Arhat, which are the means of Release.--Sa _m_ vara is such deep\nmeditation (Samadhi) as stops the action of the sense-organs.--Release,\nfinally, is the manifestation of the Self in its essential nature, free from\nall afflictions such as passion, and so on.--The atoms which are the causes of\nearth and the other compounds, are not, as the Vai _s_ eshikas and others\nhold, of four different kinds, but have all the same nature; the distinctive\nqualities of earth, and so on, are due to a modification (pari _n_ ama) of the\natoms. The _G_ ainas further hold that the whole complex of things is of an\nambiguous nature in so far as being existent and non-existent, permanent and\nnon-permanent, separate and non-separate. To prove this they apply their so-\ncalled sapta-bha _n_ gi-nyaya ('the system of the seven paralogisms')--'May\nbe, it is'; 'May be, it is not'; 'May be, it is and is not'; 'May be, it is\nnot predicable'; 'May be, it is and is not predicable'; 'May be, it is not,\nand is not predicable'; 'May be, it is and is not, and is not predicable.'\nWith the help of this they prove that all things--which they declare to\nconsist of substance (dravya), and paryaya--to be existing, one and permanent\n\np. 518\n\nin so far as they are substances, and the opposite in so far as they are\nparyayas. By paryaya they understand the particular states of substances, and\nas those are of the nature of Being as well as Non-being, they manage to prove\nexistence, non-existence, and so on.--With regard to this the Sutra remarks\nthat no such proof is possible,'Not so, on account of the impossibility in\none'; i.e. because contradictory attributes such as existence and non-\nexistence cannot at the same time belong to one thing, not any more than light\nand darkness. As a substance and particular states qualifying it--and (by the\n_G_ ainas), called paryaya--are different things (padartha), one substance\ncannot be connected with opposite attributes. It is thus not possible that a\nsubstance qualified by one particular state, such as existence, should at the\nsame time be qualified by the opposite state, i.e. non-existence. The non-\npermanency, further, of a substance consists in its being the abode of those\nparticular states which are called origination and destruction; how then\nshould permanency, which is of an opposite nature, reside in the substance at\nthe same time? Difference (bhinnatva) again consists in things being the\nabodes of contradictory attributes; non-difference, which is the opposite of\nthis, cannot hence possibly reside in the same things which are the abode of\ndifference; not any more than the generic character of a horse and that of a\nbuffalo can belong to one animal. We have explained this matter at length,\nwhen--under Sutra I, 1--refuting the bhedabheda-theory. Time we are conscious\nof only as an attribute of substances (not as an independent substance), and\nthe question as to its being and non-being, and so on, does not therefore call\nfor a separate discussion. To speak of time as being and non-being in no way\ndiffers from generic characteristics ( _g_ ati), and so on, being spoken of in\nthe same way; for--as we have explained before--of _g_ ati and the like we are\nconscious only as attributes of substances.--But (the _G_ aina may here be\nsupposed to ask the Vedantin), how can you maintain that Brahman, although one\nonly, yet at the same time is the Self of all?--Because, we reply, the whole\naggregate of sentient and non-sentient\n\np. 519\n\nbeings constitutes the body of the Supreme Person, omniscient, omnipotent, and\nso on. And that the body and the person embodied and their respective\nattributes are of totally different nature (so that Brahman is not touched by\nthe defects of his body), we have explained likewise.--Moreover, as your six\nsubstances, soul, and so on, are not one substance and one paryaya, their\nbeing one substance, and so on, cannot be used to prove their being one and\nalso not one, and so on.--And if it should be said that those six substances\nare such (viz. one and several, and so on), each owing to its own paryaya and\nits own nature, we remark that then you cannot avoid contradicting your own\ntheory of everything being of an ambiguous nature. Things which stand to each\nother in the relation of mutual non-existence cannot after all be identical.--\nHence the theory of the ( _G_ ainas is not reasonable. Moreover it is liable\nto the same objections which we have above set forth as applying to all\ntheories of atoms constituting the universal cause, without the guidance of a\nLord.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 33.
