 \nFor not the mightiest lord of these  \nCan brave my will and live at ease.  \nFate finds in me a mightier fate  \nTo burn the fires that devastate.  \nWith unresisted influence I  \nCan force e'en Death himself to die,  \nWith all-surpassing might restrain  \nThe fury of the hurricane,  \nAnd burn in my tremendous ire  \nThe glory of the sun and fire.'  \n\nAs thus the fiend's hot fury blazed,  \nHis trembling hands Akampan raised,  \nAnd with a voice which fear made weak,  \nPermission craved his tale to speak.  \nKing Ravan gave the leave he sought,  \nAnd bade him tell the news he brought.  \nHis courage rose, his voice grew bold,  \nAnd thus his mournful tale he told:  \n\n'A prince with mighty shoulders, sprung  \nFrom Das'aratha, brave and young,  \nWith arms well moulded, bears the name  \nOf Rama with a lion's frame.  \nRenowned, successful, dark of limb,  \nEarth has no warrior equals him.  \nHe fought in Janasthan and slew  \nDushan the fierce and Khara too.'  \n\nRavan the giants' royal chief.  \nReceived Akampan's tale of grief.  \nThen, panting like an angry snake,  \nThese words in turn the monarch spake:  \n\n'Say quick, did Rama seek the shade  \nOf Janasthan with Indra's aid,  \nAnd all the dwellers in the skies  \nTo back his hardy enterprise?'  \n\nAkampan heard, and straight obeyed  \nHis master, and his answer made.  \nThen thus the power and might he told  \nOf Raghu's son the lofty-souled:  \n\n'Best is that chief of all who know  \nWith deftest art to draw the bow.  \nHis are strange arms of heavenly might,  \nAnd none can match him in the fight.  \nHis brother Lakshman brave as he,  \nFair as the rounded moon to see,  \nWith eyes like night and voice that comes  \nDeep as the roll of beaten drums,  \nBy Rama's side stands ever near,  \nLike wind that aids the flame's career.  \nThat glorious chief, that prince of kings,  \nOn Janasthan this ruin brings.  \nNo Gods were there,--dismiss the thought  \nNo heavenly legions came and fought.  \nHis swift-winged arrows Rama sent,  \nEach bright with gold and ornament.  \nTo serpents many-faced they turned:  \n\np. 266  \n\nThe giant hosts they ate and burned.  \nWhere'er these fled in wild dismay  \nRama was there to strike and slay.  \nBy him O King of high estate,  \nIs Janasthan left desolate.'  \n\nAkampan ceased: in angry pride  \nThe giant monarch thus replied:  \n'To Janasthan myself will go  \nAnd lay these daring brothers low.'  \n\nThus spoke the king in furious mood;  \nAkampan then his speech renewed:  \n'O listen while I tell at length  \nThe terror of the hero's strength.  \nNo power can check, no might can tame  \nRama, a chief of noblest fame.  \nHe with resistless shafts can stay  \nThe torrent foaming on its way.  \nSky, stars, and constellations, all  \nTo his fierce might would yield and fall.  \nHis power could earth itself uphold  \nDown sinking as it sank of old. 1  \nOr all its plains and cities drown,  \nBreaking the wild sea's barrier down;  \nCrush the great deep's impetuous will,  \nOr bid the furious wind be still.  \nHe glorious in his high estate  \nThe triple world could devastate,  \nAnd there, supreme of men, could place  \nHis creatures of a new-born race.  \nNever can mighty Rama be  \nO'vercome in fight, my King, by thee.  \nThy giant host the day might win  \nFrom him, if heaven were gained by sin.  \nIf Gods were joined with demons, they  \nCould ne'er, I ween, that hero slay,  \nBut guile may kill the wondrous man;  \nAttend while I disclose the plan.  \nHis wife, above all women graced,  \nIs Sita of the dainty waist,  \nWith limbs to fair proportion true,  \nAnd a soft skin of lustrous hue,  \nRound neck and arm rich gems are twined:  \nShe is the gem of womankind.  \nWith her no bright Gandharvi vies,  \nNo nymph or Goddess in the skies;  \nAnd none to rival her would dare  \n'Mid dames who part the long black hair.  \nThat hero in the wood beguile,  \nAnd steal his lovely spouse the while.  \n'Reft of his darling wife, be sure,  \nBrief days the mourner will endure.'  \n\nWith flattering hope of triumph moved  \nThe giant king that plan approved,  \nPondered the counsel in his breast,  \nAnd then Akampan thus addressed:  \n'Forth in my car I go at morn,  \nNone but the driver with me borne,  \nAnd this fair Sita will I bring  \nBack to my city triumphing.'  \n\nForth in his car by asses drawn  \nThe giant monarch sped at dawn,  \nBright as the sun, the chariot cast  \nLight through the sky as on it passed.  \nThen high in air that best of cars  \nTraversed the path of lunar stars,  \nSending a fitful radiance pale  \nAs moonbeams shot through cloudy veil.  \nFar on his airy way he flew:  \nNear Tadakeya's 1b grove he drew,  \nMaricha welcomed him, and placed  \nBefore him food which giants taste,  \nWith honour led him to a seat,  \nAnd brought him water for his feet;  \nAnd then with timely words addressed  \nSuch question to his royal guest:  \n\n'Speak, is it well with thee whose sway  \nThe giant multitudes obey?  \nI know not all, and ask in fear  \nThe cause, O King, why thou art here.'  \n\nRavan, the giants' mighty king,  \nHeard wise Maricha's questioning,  \nAnd told with ready answer, taught  \nIn eloquence, the cause he sought:  \n'My guards, the bravest of my band.  \nAre slain by Rama's vigorous hand,  \nAnd Janasthan, that feared no hate  \nOf foes, is rendered desolate.  \nCome, aid me in the plan I lay  \nTo steal the conqueror's wife away.'  \n\nMaricha heard the king's request,  \nAnd thus the giant chief addressed:  \n\n'What foe in friendly guise is he  \nWho spoke of Sita's name to thee?  \nWho is the wretch whose thought would bring  \nDestruction on the giants' king?  \nWhose is the evil counsel, say,  \nThat bids thee bear his wife away,  \nAnd careless of thy life provoke  \nEarth's loftiest with threatening stroke?  \nA foe is he who dared suggest  \nThis hopeless folly to thy breast,  \nWhose ill advice would bid thee draw  \nThe venomed fang from serpent's jaw.  \nBy whose unwise suggestion led  \nWilt thou the path of ruin tread?  \nWhence falls the blow that would destroy  \nThy gentle sleep of ease and joy?  \nLike some wild elephant is he  \nThat rears his trunk on high,  \nLord of an ancient pedigree,  \nHuge tusks, and furious eye.  \nRavan, no rover of the night  \nWith bravest heart can brook,  \nMet in the front of deadly fight,  \nOn Raghu's son to look.  \n\np. 267  \n\nThe giant hosts were brave and strong,  \n   Good at the bow and spear:  \nBut Rama slew the routed throng,  \n   A lion 'mid the deer.  \nNo lion's tooth can match his sword,  \n   Or arrows fiercely shot:  \nHe sleeps, he sleeps--the lion lord;  \n   Be wise and rouse him not.  \nO Monarch of the giants, well  \n   Upon my counsel think,  \nLest thou for ever in the hell  \n   Of Rama's vengeance sink:  \nA hell, where deadly shafts are sent  \n   From his tremendous-bow,  \nWhile his great arms all flight prevent,  \n   Like deepest mire below:  \nWhere the wild floods of battle rave  \n   Above the foeman's head,  \nAnd each with many a feathery wave  \n   Of shafts is garlanded.  \nO, quench the flames that in thy breast  \n   With raging fury burn;  \nAnd pacified and self-possessed  \n   To Lanka's town return.  \nRest thou in her imperial bowers  \n   With thine own wives content,  \nAnd in the wood let Rama's hours  \n   With Sita still be spent.'  \n\nThe lord of Lanka's isle obeyed  \nThe counsel, and his purpose stayed.  \nBorne on his car he parted thence  \nAnd gained his royal residence.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[265:1](ry229.htm#fr_481) The capital of the giant king Ravan.\n\n[265:1b](ry229.htm#fr_482) Kuvera, the God of gold\n\n[266:1](ry229.htm#fr_483) In the great deluge.\n\n[266:1b](ry229.htm#fr_484) The giant Maricha, son of Tadaka.
