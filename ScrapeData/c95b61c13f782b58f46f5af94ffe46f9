Damn! Damn! Damn! I\'m tired of being friends with this\nsporting king. "There\'s a deer!" he shouts, "There\'s a boar!" And off he\nchases on a summer noon through woods where shade is few and far between. We\ndrink hot, stinking water from the mountain streams, flavoured with leaves--\nnasty! At odd times we get a little tepid meat to eat. And the horses and the\nelephants make such a noise that I can\'t even be comfortable at night. Then\nthe hunters and the bird-chasers--damn \'em--wake me up bright and early. They\ndo make an ear-splitting rumpus when they start for the woods. But even that\nisn\'t the whole misery. There\'s a new pimple growing on the old boil. He left\nus behind and went hunting a deer. And there in a hermitage they say he found\n--oh, dear! oh, dear! he found a hermit-girl named Shakuntala. Since then he\nhasn\'t a thought of going back to town. I lay awake all night, thinking about\nit. What can I do? Well, I\'ll see my friend when he is dressed and beautified.\n( _He walks and looks about_.) Hello! Here he comes, with his bow in his hand,\nand his girl in his heart. He is wearing a wreath of wild flowers! I\'ll\npretend to be all knocked up. Perhaps I can get a rest that way. ( _He stands,\nleaning on his stag. Enter the king, as described_.)\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ).\n\nAlthough my darling is not lightly won,  \n  She seemed to love me, and my hopes are bright;  \nThough love be balked ere joy be well begun,  \n  A common longing is itself delight.\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _Smiling_.) Thus does a lover deceive himself. He\njudges his love\'s feelings by his own desires.\n\np. 18\n\nHer glance was loving--but \'twas not for me;  \nHer step was slow--\'twas grace, not coquetry;  \nHer speech was short--to her detaining friend.  \nIn things like these love reads a selfish end!\n\n_Clown_ ( _standing as before_ ). Well, king, I can\'t move my hand. I can only\ngreet you with my voice.\n\n_King_ ( _looking and smiling_ ). What makes you lame?\n\n_Clown_. Good! You hit a man in the eye, and then ask him why the tears come.\n\n_King_. I do not understand you. Speak plainly.\n\n_Clown_. When a reed bends over like a hunchback, do you blame the reed or the\nriver-current?\n\n_King_. The river-current, of course.\n\n_Clown_. And you are to blame for my troubles.\n\n_King_. How so?\n\n_Clown_. It\'s a fine thing for you to neglect your royal duties and such a\nsure job--to live in the woods! What\'s the good of talking? Here I am, a\nBrahman, and my joints are all shaken up by this eternal running after wild\nanimals, so that I can\'t move. Please be good to me. Let us have a rest for\njust one day.\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). He says this. And I too, when I remember Kanva\'s\ndaughter, have little desire for the chase. For\n\nThe bow is strung, its arrow near;  \n  And yet I cannot bend  \nThat bow against the fawns who share  \n  Soft glances with their friend.\n\n_Clown_ ( _observing the king_ ). He means more than he says. I might as well\nweep in the woods.\n\n_King_ ( _smiling_ ). What more could I mean? I have been thinking that I\nought to take my friend\'s advice.\n\n_Clown_ ( _cheerfully_ ). Long life to you, then. ( _He unstiffens_.)\n\n_King_. Wait. Hear me out.\n\n_Clown_. Well, sir?\n\n_King_. When you are rested, you must be my companion in another task--an easy\none.\n\n_Clown_. Crushing a few sweetmeats?\n\n_King_. I will tell you presently.\n\n_Clown_. Pray command my leisure.\n\np. 19\n\n_King_. Who stands without? ( _Enter the door-keeper_.)\n\n_Door-keeper_. I await your Majesty\'s commands.\n\n_King_. Raivataka, summon the general.\n\n_Door-keeper_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _He goes out, then returns with the\ngeneral_.) Follow me, sir. There is his Majesty, listening to our\nconversation. Draw near, sir.\n\n_General_ ( _observing the king, to himself_ ). Hunting is declared to be a\nsin, yet it brings nothing but good to the king. See!\n\nHe does not heed the cruel sting  \nOf his recoiling, twanging string;  \nThe mid-day sun, the dripping sweat  \nAffect him not, nor make him fret;  \nHis form, though sinewy and spare,  \nIs most symmetrically fair;  \nNo mountain-elephant could be  \nMore filled with vital strength than he.\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _He approaches_.) Victory to your Majesty! The forest\nis full of deer-tracks, and beasts of prey cannot be far off. What better\noccupation could we have?\n\n_King_. Bhadrasena, my enthusiasm is broken. Madhavya has been preaching\nagainst hunting.\n\n_General_ ( _aside to the clown_ ). Stick to it, friend Madhavya. I will\nhumour the king a moment. ( _Aloud_.) Your Majesty, he is a chattering idiot.\nYour Majesty may judge by his own case whether hunting is an evil. Consider:\n\nThe hunter\'s form grows sinewy, strong, and light;  \nHe learns, from beasts of prey, how wrath and fright  \nAffect the mind; his skill he loves to measure  \nWith moving targets. \'Tis life\'s chiefest pleasure.\n\n_Clown_ ( _angrily_ ). Get out! Get out with your strenuous life! The king has\ncome to his senses. But you, you son of a slave-wench, can go chasing from\nforest to forest, till you fall into the jaws of some old bear that is looking\nfor a deer or a jackal.\n\n_King_. Bhadrasena, I cannot take your advice, because I am in the vicinity of\na hermitage. So for to-day\n\nThe horned buffalo may shake  \nThe turbid water of the lake; p. 20  \nShade-seeking deer may chew the cud,  \nBoars trample swamp-grass in the mud;  \nThe bow I bend in hunting, may  \nEnjoy a listless holiday.\n\n_General_. Yes, your Majesty.\n\n_King_. Send back the archers who have gone ahead. And forbid the soldiers to\nvex the hermitage, or even to approach it. Remember:\n\nThere lurks a hidden fire in each  \n  Religious hermit-bower;  \nCool sun-stones kindle if assailed  \n  By any foreign power.\n\n_General_. Yes, your Majesty.\n\n_Clown_. Now will you get out with your strenuous life? ( _Exit genera_ l.)\n\n_King_ ( _to his attendants_ ). Lay aside your hunting dress. And you,\nRaivataka, return to your post of duty.\n\n_Raivataka_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_Clown_. You have got rid of the vermin. Now be seated on this flat stone,\nover which the trees spread their canopy of shade. I can\'t sit down till you\ndo.\n\n_King_. Lead the way.\n\n_Clown_. Follow me. ( _They walk about and sit down_.)\n\n_King_. Friend Madhavya, you do not know what vision is. You have not seen the\nfairest of all objects.\n\n_Clown_. I see you, right in front of me.\n\n_King_. Yes, every one thinks himself beautiful. But I was speaking of\nShakuntala, the ornament of the hermitage.\n\n_Clown_ ( _to himself_ ). I mustn\'t add fuel to the flame. ( _Aloud_.) But you\ncan\'t have her because she is a hermit-girl. What is the use of seeing her?\n\n_King_. Fool!\n\nAnd is it selfish longing then,  \n  That draws our souls on high  \nThrough eyes that have forgot to wink,  \n  As the new moon climbs the sky?\n\n[paragraph continues] Besides, Dushyanta\'s thoughts dwell on no forbidden\nobject.\n\n_Clown_. Well, tell me about her.\n\np. 21\n\n_King_.\n\nSprung from a nymph of heaven  \n  Wanton and gay,  \nWho spurned the blessing given,  \n  Going her way;\n\nBy the stern hermit taken  \n  In her most need:  \nSo fell the blossom shaken,  \n  Flower on a weed.\n\n_Clown_ ( _laughing_ ). You are like a man who gets tired of good dates and\nlongs for sour tamarind. All the pearls of the palace are yours, and you want\nthis girl!\n\n_King_. My friend, you have not seen her, or you could not talk so.\n\n_Clown_. She must be charming if she surprises you.\n\n_King_. Oh, my friend, she needs not many words.\n\nShe is God\'s vision, of pure thought  \n  Composed in His creative mind;  \nHis reveries of beauty wrought  \n  The peerless pearl of womankind.  \nSo plays my fancy when I see  \nHow great is God, how lovely she.\n\n_Clown_. How the women must hate her!\n\n_King_. This too is in my thought.\n\nShe seems a flower whose fragrance none has tasted,  \n  A gem uncut by workman\'s tool,  \nA branch no desecrating hands have wasted,  \n  Fresh honey, beautifully cool.\n\nNo man on earth deserves to taste her beauty,  \n  Her blameless loveliness and worth,  \nUnless he has fulfilled man\'s perfect duty--  \n  And is there such a one on earth?\n\n_Clown_. Marry her quick, then, before the poor girl falls into the hands of\nsome oily-headed hermit.\n\n_King_. She is dependent on her father, and he is not here.\n\n_Clown_. But how does she feel toward you?\n\np. 22\n\n_King_. My friend, hermit-girls are by their very nature timid. And yet\n\nWhen I was near, she could not look at me;  \n  She smiled--but not to me--and half denied it;  \nShe would not show her love for modesty,  \n  Yet did not try so very hard to hide it.\n\n_Clown_. Did you want her to climb into your lap the first time she saw you?\n\n_King_. But when she went away with her friends, she almost showed that she\nloved me.\n\nWhen she had hardly left my side,  \n"I cannot walk," the maiden cried,  \nAnd turned her face, and feigned to free  \nThe dress not caught upon the tree.\n\n_Clown_. She has given you some memories to chew on. I suppose that is why you\nare so in love with the pious grove.\n\n_King_. My friend, think of some pretext under which we may return to the\nhermitage.\n\n_Clown_. What pretext do you need? Aren\'t you the king?\n\n_King_. What of that?\n\n_Clown_. Collect the taxes on the hermits\' rice.\n\n_King_. Fool! It is a very different tax which these hermits pay--one that\noutweighs heaps of gems.\n\nThe wealth we take from common men,  \n  Wastes while we cherish;  \nThese share with us such holiness  \n  As ne\'er can perish.\n\n_Voices behind the scenes_. Ah, we have found him.\n\n_King_ ( _listening_ ). The voices are grave and tranquil. These must be\nhermits. ( _Enter the door-keeper_.)\n\n_Door-keeper_. Victory, O King. There are two hermit-youths at the gate.\n\n_King_. Bid them enter at once.\n\n_Door-keeper_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _He goes out, then returns with the\nyouths_.) Follow me.\n\n_First youth_ ( _looking at the king_ ). A majestic presence, yet it inspires\nconfidence. Nor is this wonderful in a king who is half a saint. For to him\n\np. 23\n\nThe splendid palace serves as hermitage;  \nHis royal government, courageous, sage,  \nAdds daily to his merit; it is given  \nTo him to win applause from choirs of heaven  \nWhose anthems to his glory rise and swell,  \nProclaiming him a king, and saint as well.\n\n_Second youth_. My friend, is this Dushyanta, friend of Indra?\n\n_First youth_. It is.\n\n_Second youth_.\n\nNor is it wonderful that one whose arm  \nMight bolt a city gate, should keep from harm  \n  The whole broad earth dark-belted by the sea;  \nFor when the gods in heaven with demons fight,  \nDushyanta\'s bow and Indra\'s weapon bright  \n  Are their reliance for the victory.\n\n_The two youths_ ( _approaching_ ). Victory, O King!\n\n_King_ ( _rising_ ). I salute you.\n\n_The two youths_. All hail! ( _They offer fruit_.)\n\n_King_ ( _receiving it and bowing low_ ). May I know the reason of your\ncoming?\n\n_The two youths_. The hermits have learned that you are here, and they\nrequest------\n\n_King_. They command rather.\n\n_The two youths_. The powers of evil disturb our pious life in the absence of\nthe hermit-father. We therefore ask that you will remain a few nights with\nyour charioteer to protect the hermitage.\n\n_King_. I shall be most happy to do so.\n\n_Clown_ ( _to the king_ ). You rather seem to like being collared this way.\n\n_King_. Raivataka, tell my charioteer to drive up, and to bring the bow and\narrows.\n\n_Raivataka_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_The two youths_.\n\nThou art a worthy scion of  \n  The kings who ruled our nation  \nAnd found, defending those in need,  \n  Their truest consecration.\n\np. 24\n\n_King_. Pray go before. And I will follow straightway.\n\n_The two youths_. Victory, O King! ( _Exeunt_.)\n\n_King_. Madhavya, have you no curiosity to see Shakuntala?\n\n_Clown_. I did have an unending curiosity, but this talk about the powers of\nevil has put an end to it.\n\n_King_. Do not fear. You will be with me.\n\n_Clown_. I\'ll stick close to your chariot-wheel. ( _Enter the door-keeper_.)\n\n_Door-keeper_. Your Majesty, the chariot is ready, and awaits your departure\nto victory. But one Karabhaka has come from the city, a messenger from the\nqueen-mother.\n\n_King_ (respectfully). Sent by my mother?\n\n_Door-keeper_. Yes.\n\n_King_. Let him enter.\n\n_Door-keeper_ ( _goes out and returns with_ KARABHAKA). Karabhaka, here is his\nMajesty. You may draw near.\n\n_Karabhaka_ ( _approaching and bowing low_ ). Victory to your Majesty. The\nqueen-mother sends her commands------\n\n_King_. What are her commands?\n\n_Karabhaka_. She plans to end a fasting ceremony on the fourth day from to-\nday. And on that occasion her dear son must not fail to wait upon her.\n\n_King_. On the one side is my duty to the hermits, on the other my mother\'s\ncommand. Neither may be disregarded. What is to be done?\n\n_Clown_ ( _laughing_ ). Stay half-way between, like Trishanku.\n\nKing. In truth, I am perplexed.\n\nTwo inconsistent duties sever  \n  My mind with cruel shock,  \nAs when the current of a river  \n  Is split upon a rock.\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _He reflects_.) My friend, the queen-mother has always\nfelt toward you as toward a son. Do you return, tell her what duty keeps me\nhere, and yourself perform the offices of a son.\n\n_Clown_. You don\'t think I am afraid of the devils?\n\n_King_ ( _smiling_ ). O mighty Brahman, who could suspect it?\n\n_Clown_. But I want to travel like a prince.\n\n_King_. I will send all the soldiers with you, for the pious grove must not be\ndisturbed.\n\np. 25\n\n_Clown_ ( _strutting_ ). Aha! Look at the heir-apparent!\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). The fellow is a chatterbox. He might betray my\nlonging to the ladies of the palace. Good, then! ( _He takes the clown by the\nhand. Aloud_.) Friend Madhavya, my reverence for the hermits draws me to the\nhermitage. Do not think that I am really in love with the hermit-girl. Just\nthink:\n\nA king, and a girl of the calm hermit-grove,  \nBred with the fawns, and a stranger to love!  \nThen do not imagine a serious quest;  \nThe light words I uttered were spoken in jest.\n\n_Clown_. Oh, I understand that well enough.\n\n( _Exeunt ambo_.)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act III. The Love-Making](sha07.htm)\n\n'
