At every monthly _S_ raddha he shall use, in whatever manner he may be\nable, one dro _n_ a of sesamum. 1\n\n2\\. And he shall feed Brahma _n_ as endowed with all (good qualities), and\nthey shall not give the fragments (of the food) to a person who does not\npossess the same good qualities (as the Brahma _n_ as).\n\n3\\. He who desires prosperity shall fast in the half of the year when the sun\ngoes to the north, under the constellation Tishya, in the first half of the\nmonth, for (a day and) a night at least, prepare a Sthalipaka-offering, offer\nburnt-oblations to Kubera (the god of riches), feed a Brahma _n_ a with that\n(food prepared for the Sthalipaka) mixed with clarified butter, and make him\nwish prosperity with (a Mantra) implying prosperity. 3\n\n4\\. This (rite he shall repeat) daily until the next Tishya(-day).\n\n5\\. On the second (Tishya-day and during the second month he shall feed) two\n(Brahma _n_ as).\n\n6\\. On the third (Tishya-day and during the third month he shall feed) three\n(Brahma _n_ as).\n\n7\\. In this manner (the Tishya-rite is to be performed) for a year, with a\n(monthly) increase (of the number of Brahma _n_ as fed).}\n\np. 152\n\n8\\. (Thus) he obtains great prosperity.\n\n9\\. But the fasting takes place on the first (Tishya-day) only.\n\n10\\. He shall avoid to eat those things which have lost their strength (as\nbutter-milk, curds, and whey).\n\n11\\. He shall avoid to tread on ashes or husks of grain. 11\n\n12\\. To wash one foot with the other, or to place one foot on the other,\n\n13\\. And to swing his feet,\n\n14\\. And to place one leg crosswise over the knee (of the other),\n\n15\\. And to make his nails\n\n16\\. Or to make (his finger-joints) crack without a (good) reason, 16\n\n17\\. And all other (acts) which they blame.\n\n18\\. And let him acquire money in all ways that are lawful.\n\n19\\. And let him spend money on worthy (persons or objects). 19\n\n20\\. And let him not give anything to an unworthy (person), of whom he does\nnot stand in fear.\n\n21\\. And let him conciliate men (by gifts or kindness).\n\n22\\. And he may enjoy the pleasures which are not forbidden by the holy law.\n\n23\\. (Acting) thus he conquers both worlds.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[151:1](sbe0255.htm#fr_717) **20**. A dro _n_ a equals 128 seers or _s_ eras.\nThe latter is variously reckoned at 1-3 lbs.\n\n[151:3](sbe0255.htm#fr_718) The reason why the constellation Tishya has been\nchosen for this rite seems to be that Tishya has another name, Pushya, i.e.\n'prosperous'. This sacrifice is to begin on the Tishya-day of the month called\nTaisha or Pausha (December-January), and to continue for one year.\n\n[152:11](sbe0255.htm#fr_719) Manu IV, 7 8.\n\n[152:16](sbe0255.htm#fr_720) 'Good reasons for cracking the joints are fatigue\nor rheumatism.'--Haradatta.\n\n[152:19](sbe0255.htm#fr_721) Manu XI, 6, and passim.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 9, Kha _n_ _d_ a 21](sbe0256.htm)\n\n"
