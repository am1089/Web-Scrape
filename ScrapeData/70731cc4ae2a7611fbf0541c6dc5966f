XXXII.\n\nChildren of Krishn\xcc\x81a. Usha, the daughter of Ban\xcc\x81a, sees Aniruddha in a dream,\nand becomes enamoured of him.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--I have enumerated to you Pradyumna and the other sons of Rukmini.\nSatyabhama bore Bhanu and Bhairika. The sons of Rohin\xcc\x81i were Diptimat,\nTamrapakshi, and others. The powerful \xc5\x9aamba and other sons were born of\nJambavati. Bhadravinda and other valiant youths were the sons of Nagnajiti.\n\xc5\x9aaivya (or Mitravinda) had several sons, of whom Sangramajit was the chief.\nVrika and others were begotten by Hari on Madri. Lakshmana had Gatravat and\nothers: and \xc5\x9aruta and others were the sons of Kalindi 1. Krishn\xcc\x81a had sons\nalso by his other wives, in all one hundred and eighty thousand. The eldest of\nthe whole was Pradyumna, the son of Rukmini: his son was Aniruddha, from whom\nVraja was born: his mother was Usha, the daughter of Ban\xcc\x81a, and grand-daughter\nof Bali, whom Aniruddha won in war. On that occasion a fierce battle took\nplace between Hari and \xc5\x9aankara, in which the thousand arms of Ban\xcc\x81a were\nlopped away by the discus of the former.\n\nMAITREYA.--HOW happened it, venerable Brahman, that a contest on account of\nUsha arose between \xc5\x9aiva and Krishn\xcc\x81a? and in what manner did Hari cut off the\nthousand arms of Ban\xcc\x81a? This, illustrious sir, thou art able to narrate.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Usha, the daughter of Ban\xcc\x81a, having seen Parvati sporting with her\nlord, \xc5\x9aambhu, was inspired with a wish for similar dalliance. The beautiful\nGauri, who knows the hearts of all, said to Usha, "Do not grieve; you shall\nhave a husband." "But when will this be?" thought Usha to herself, "or who\nwill be my lord?" On which Parvati continued; "He who shall appear to you,\nprincess, in a dream on the twelfth lunation of the light half of Vai\xc5\x9bakha, he\nwill be your husband."\n\np. 592\n\n[paragraph continues] Accordingly, as the goddess had foretold, on that lunar\nday a youth appeared to Usha in a dream, of whose person she became enamoured.\nWhen she woke, and no longer perceived him, she was overcome with sorrow, and,\nunrestrained by modesty, demanded of her companion whither he had gone. The\ncompanion and friend of the princess was Chitralekha, the daughter of\nKubhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, the minister of Ban\xcc\x81a. "Of whom do you speak?" inquired she of\nUsha. But the princess, recollecting herself, was ashamed, and remained\nsilent. At length, however, Chitralekha conciliated her confidence, and she\nrelated to her what had passed, and what the goddess had foretold; and she\nrequested her friend to devise some means of uniting her with the person whom\nshe had beheld in her dream.\n\nChitralekha then delineated the most eminent gods, demons, spirits, and\nmortals, and shewed them to Usha. Putting aside the portraits of gods,\nspirits, snake-gods, and demons, the princess selected those of mortals, and\namongst them the heroes of the races of Andhaka and Vrishn\xcc\x81i. When she came to\nthe likenesses of Krishn\xcc\x81a and Rama, she was confused with shame; from the\nportrait of Pradyumna she modestly averted her eyes; but the moment she beheld\nthe picture of his son, the object of her passion, her eyes wide expanded, and\nall her bashfulness was discarded. "This is he! this is he!" said she to\nChitralekha; and her friend, who was endowed with magic power, bade her be of\ngood cheer, and set off through the air to Dwaraka.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[591:1](vp149.htm#fr_1551) The Bhagavata says, each of his eight queens had\nten sons, and gives the ten names of each set, with one or two exceptions.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXIII](vp150.htm)\n\n'
