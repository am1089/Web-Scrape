And (the pradhana cannot be meant) because\n\np. 246\n\nthere is no statement as to (the avyakta) being something to be cognised.\n\nThe Sa _n_ khyas, moreover, represent the pradhana as something to be cognised\nin so far as they say that from the knowledge of the difference of the\nconstitutive elements of the pradhana and of the soul there results the\ndesired isolation of the soul. For without a knowledge of the nature of those\nconstitutive elements it is impossible to cognise the difference of the soul\nfrom them. And somewhere they teach that the pradhana is to be cognised by him\nwho wishes to attain special powers.--Now in the passage under discussion the\navyakta is not mentioned as an object of knowledge; we there meet with the\nmere word avyakta, and there is no sentence intimating that the avyakta is to\nbe known or meditated upon. And it is impossible to maintain that a knowledge\nof things which (knowledge) is not taught in the text is of any advantage to\nman.--For this reason also we maintain that the word avyakta cannot denote the\npradhana.--Our interpretation, on the other hand, is unobjectionable, since\naccording to it the passage mentions the body (not as an object of knowledge,\nbut merely) for the purpose of throwing light on the highest place of Vish _n_\nu, in continuation of the simile in which the body had been compared to a\nchariot.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 5](sbe34116.htm)\n\n'
