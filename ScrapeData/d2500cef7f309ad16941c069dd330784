It appears to have evolved from a cycle of popular hero songs, but\nafter assuming epic form it was utilized by the Brahmans for purposes of\nreligious propaganda. The warriors were represented as sons of gods or allies\nof demons, and the action of the original narrative was greatly hampered by\ninserting long speeches and discussions regarding Brahmanic conceptions and\nbeliefs. An excellent example of this process is afforded by the famous\n_Bhagavad-gita_ , from which we have quoted in the previous chapter. The\nnarrative of the first day\'s battle is interrupted to allow Krishna to expound\nthe\n\np. 139\n\ndoctrines of the Vaishnava faith, with purpose to make converts to the cult of\nVishnu. Almost every incident in the poem is utilized in a similar manner. In\nfact the epic, as we are informed in the opening section, "furnisheth the\nmeans of arriving at the knowledge of Brahma". The priests, with this aim in\nview, loaded the chariots of heroes with religious treatises, and transformed\na tribal struggle for supremacy into a great holy war. If the _Iliad_ survived\nto us only in Pope\'s translation, and our theologians had scattered through\nit, say, metrical renderings of Bunyan\'s _Pilgrim\'s Progress_ , the Thirty-\nnine Articles of the Church of England, the _Westminster Confession of Faith_\n, Fox\'s _Book of Martyrs_ , and a few representative theological works of\nrival sects, a fate similar to that which has befallen the _Mahabharata_ would\nnow overshadow the great Homeric masterpiece. The "Iliad of India" is a part\nof what may be called the Hindu Bible, which embraces the _Ramayana_ , the\n_Vedas_ , the _Upanishads_ , the _Puranas_ , &c.\n\nThe _Ram ayana_, which is called "the Odyssey of India", because it deals with\nthe wanderings and adventures of the exiled prince Rama, was utilized mainly\nby the cult of Vishnu, but both Vishnu and Shiva figure as great gods in the\n_Mah abharata_, and now one and anon the other is given first place.\n\nIf the documentary material, which is available in India for dealing with its\nancient religious beliefs, were as scanty as those which survive to us from\nAncient Egypt, comparisons might have been drawn between the Brahmanic cults\nand the priestly theorists of Heliopolis, Memphis, Sais, &c., and it might\nhave been remarked of the one nation as of the other that its people clung to\narchaic beliefs long after new and higher religious conceptions obtained as\ntenets of orthodox religion. In India\n\np. 140\n\nthe process of change and development can, however, be not only traced, but\npartially accounted for, as we have shown. Old myths were embraced in the\nepics and the _Puranas_ for the purpose of educating the people by effecting a\ncompromise between folk religion and the profound doctrines of the ancient\nforest sages.\n\n"Father Manu" of the _Vedas_ , who appears to have been worshipped as a\npatriarchal ancestor, was, for instance, embraced in the _Mah abharata_ by the\ncult of Vishnu. He had been exalted by the ritualists as one who was greater\nthan the gods, because he had been the first to inaugurate sacrificial rites,\nand he was afterwards associated with Brahma in performing some of the acts of\nCreation at the beginning of one of the Yugas (Ages). It was necessary,\ntherefore, to show that he owed his power and opportunities to Vishnu.\n\nIn the _Mah abharata_ the sage Markandeya refers to Manu as the great Rishi,\nwho was equal unto Brahma in glory. He had practised rigid austerities in a\nforest for ten thousand years, standing on one leg with uplifted hand. One day\nwhile he brooded in wet clothes, a fish rose from a stream and asked for his\nprotection against the greater fish which desired to swallow it, at the same\ntime promising to reward him. Manu placed the fish in an earthen jar and\ntended it carefully till it increased in size; then he put it in a tank. The\nfish continued to grow until the tank became small for it, and Manu heard it\npleading to be transferred to the Ganges, "the favourite spouse of Ocean". He\ncarried it to the river, and in time the fish spoke to him, saying: "I cannot\nmove about in the river on account of my great length and bulk. Take me\nquickly to the Ocean." Manu was enabled to carry the fish from the Ganges to\nthe sea, and then it spoke with a smile and said:\n\n\n\n[![INTERIOR OF A ROCK-HEWN BUDDHIST TEMPLE \\(AJANTA\\)](tn/14000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/14000.jpg)  \nINTERIOR OF A ROCK-HEWN BUDDHIST TEMPLE (AJANTA)  \n\n\n\np. 141\n\n"Know thou, O worshipful one, my protector, that the dissolution of the\nUniverse is at hand. The time is ripe for purging the world. I will therefore\nadvise thee what thou shouldst do, so that it may be well with thee. Build a\nstrong and massive ark, and furnish it with a long rope; thou wilt ascend in\nit with the seven Rishis (the Celestial Rishis), and take with thee all the\ndifferent seeds enumerated by Brahmans in days of yore, and preserve them\ncarefully. Wait for me and I will appear as a horned animal. Act according to\nmy instructions, for without mine aid thou canst not save thyself from the\nterrible deluge."\n\nManu gathered together all the different seeds and "set sail in an excellent\nvessel on the surging sea". He thought of the fish, and it arose out of the\nwaters like an island; he cast a noose which he fastened to the horns on its\nhead, and the fish towed the ark over the roaring sea; tossed by the billows\nthe vessel reeled about like one who is drunk. No land was in sight. "There\nwas water everywhere, and the waters covered the heaven and the firmament\nalso. . . . When the world was thus flooded none but Manu, the seven Rishis,\nand the fish could be seen."\n\nAfter many long years the vessel was towed to the highest peak of the Himavat,\nwhich is still called Naubandhana (the harbour), and it was made fast there.\nThe fish then spoke and said: "I am Brahma, the Lord of all Creatures; there\nis none greater than me. I have saved thee from this cataclysm. Manu will\ncreate again all beings--gods, Asuras, and men, and all those divisions of\ncreation which have the power of locomotion and which have it not. By\npractising severe austerities he will acquire this power. . . ."\n\nThen Manu set about creating all beings in proper and exact order. 1\n\nMarkandeya elsewhere described the universal cataclysm\n\np. 142\n\nwith more detail. After a drought lasting for many years, seven blazing suns\nwill appear in the firmament; they will drink up all the waters. Then wind-\ndriven fire will sweep over the earth, consuming all things; penetrating to\nthe nether world it will destroy what is there in a moment; it will burn up\nthe Universe. Afterwards many-coloured and brilliant clouds will collect in\nthe sky, looking like herds of elephants decked with wreaths of lightning.\nSuddenly they will burst asunder, and rain will fall incessantly for twelve\nyears until the whole world with its mountains and forests is covered with\nwater. The clouds will vanish. Then the Self-created Lord, the First Cause of\neverything, will absorb the winds and go to sleep. The Universe will become\none dread expanse of water.\n\nAccount has to be taken of the persistent legend regarding the ambrosia which\ngave strength to the gods and prolonged their existence. In "Teutonic\nmythology" it is snatched by Odin from the giants of the Underworld, and is\nconcealed in the moon, which is ever pursued by the demon wolf Managarm, who\nseeks to devour it.\n\nThe development of the Indian form of the myth is found in the story of "The\nChurning of the Ocean", which is dealt with in the _Mah abharata_, the _Ram\nayana_, and several of the _Puranas_.\n\nAccording to the epics, the ambrosia, the Indian name of which is amrita (both\nwords implying immortality), was required by the gods so as to enable them to\novercome the demons. In _Vishnu Parva_ , however, a Brahmanic addition to the\nmyth was made so as to exalt a sage and illustrate the power he could exercise\nover the old Vedic deities. It is related that Durvasas obtained from a merry\nnymph a sweet-scented, inspiring garland which made him dance. He presented it\nto Indra, who\n\np. 143\n\nplaced it on the head of his elephant. The elephant then began to prance\nabout, and grew so excited that it cast the garland on the ground. Durvasas\nwas enraged because that his gift was slighted in this manner, and cursed\nIndra and foretold the ruin of his kingdom. Thereafter the king of the gods\nbegan to suffer loss of power, whereat the other deities became alarmed,\nfearing that the demons would overcome him in battle. Appeal was made to\nBrahma, who referred the gods to Vishnu, the Preserver. That supreme being\ncommanded that the ocean should be churned for amrita.\n\nIn the epics the gods allied themselves with the demons to procure amrita from\nVishnu\'s Sea of Milk. The "churning stick" was the mountain Mandara, and the\n"churning rope" the serpent Vasuka 1 (Ananta or Shesha). Vishnu said: "The\ndemons must share in the work of churning, but I will prevent them from\ntasting of the amrita, which must be kept for Indra and the gods only."\n\nThe gods carried the mountain Mandara to the ocean, and placed it on the back\nof Kurma, the king of tortoises, who was an incarnation of Vishnu. 2 Round the\nmountain they twisted the serpent, which was "a part of a part of Vishnu", the\nAsuras holding its hood and the gods its tail. As a result of the friction\ncaused by the churning, masses of vapour issued from the serpent\'s mouth\nwhich, becoming clouds charged with lightning, poured down refreshing rains on\nthe weary workers. Fire darted forth and enwrapped the mountain, burning its\ntrees and destroying many birds, and the lions and elephants that crouched on\nits slopes. In time the Sea of Milk produced butter flavoured by the gums and\njuices which dropped from\n\np. 144\n\nthe mountain. The gods grew weary, but Vishnu gave them fresh strength to\nproceed with the work. At length the moon emerged from the ocean; then arose\nthe Apsaras, who became nymphs in Indra\'s heaven; they were followed by the\ngoddess Lakshmi, Vishnu\'s white steed, and the gleaming gem which the god\nwears on his breast. Then came Dhanwantari, the physician of the gods, who\ncarried a golden cup brimming with amrita. Beholding him, the Asuras cried\nout: "The gods have taken all else; the physician must be ours."\n\nNext arose the great elephant Airavata, which Indra took for himself. The\nchurning still went on until the blue, devastating poison appeared and began\nto flow over the earth, blazing like a flame mixed with fumes. To save the\nworld from destruction, Shiva swallowed the poison and held it in his throat.\nFrom that time he was called Nilakantha, "the blue-throated".\n\nMeanwhile the demons desired to combat against the gods for the possession of\nthe beautiful goddess Lakshmi and the amrita. But Vishnu assumed a bewitching\nfemale form, and so charmed the Asuras that they presented the amrita to that\nfair woman.\n\nVishnu immediately gave the amrita to the gods, but soon it was discovered\nthat a demon named Rahu had assumed Celestial form with purpose to drink it.\nThe amrita had only reached his throat when the sun and moon discovered him\nand informed Vishnu. The divine Preserver then flung his discus and cut off\nRahu\'s huge head, which resembled a mountain peak. Rendered immortal by the\namrita the head soared to the sky, roaring loud and long. From that day Rahu\'s\nhead, with mouth agape, has followed sun and moon, and when he swallows one or\nthe other he causes the eclipses.\n\nMeanwhile the demons fought against the gods, but\n\n\n\n[![LAKSHMI ARISING FROM THE SEA OF MILK<br> From a sculpture at\nM\xc3\xa1mallapuram](tn/14400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/14400.jpg)  \nLAKSHMI ARISING FROM THE SEA OF MILK  \nFrom a sculpture at Mamallapuram  \n\n\n\np. 145\n\nwere defeated, although they flung rocks and mountains. Thousands were slain\nby the sky-scouring discus of Vishnu, and those who survived concealed\nthemselves in the bowels of the earth and the depths of the ocean of salt\nwaters.\n\nOnce upon a time the ambrosia was robbed from the gods by Gar\xc2\xb4uda, half giant\nand half eagle, the enemy of serpents. This "lord of birds" was hatched from\nan enormous egg five hundred years after it had been laid by Diti, mother of\ngiants; his father was Kas\xc2\xb4yapa, a Brahman identified with the Pole Star, who\nhad sacrificed with desire for offspring. It happened that Diti, having lost a\nwager, was put under bondage by the demons, and could not be released until\nshe caused the amrita to be taken from a Celestial mountain where it was\nsurrounded by terrible flames, moved by violent winds, which leapt up to the\nsky. Assuming a golden body, bright as the sun, Garuda drank up many rivers\nand extinguished the fire. A fiercely revolving wheel, sharp-edged and\nbrilliant, protected the amrita, but Garuda diminished his body and entered\nbetween the spokes. Two fire-spitting snakes had next to be overcome. Garuda\nblinded them with dust and cut them to pieces. Then, having broken the\nrevolving wheel, that bright sky-ranger flew forth with the amrita which was\ncontained in the moon goblet.\n\nThe gods went in pursuit of Garuda. Indra flung his thunderbolt, but the bird\nsuffered no pain and dropped but a single feather. When he delivered the\namrita to the demons his mother was released, but ere the demons could drink\nIndra snatched up the golden moon-goblet and wended back to the heavens. The\ndemon snakes licked the grass where the goblet had been placed by Garuda, and\ntheir tongues were divided. From that day all the snakes have had divided\ntongues. . . . Garuda\n\np. 146\n\nbecame afterwards the vehicle of Vishnu; he has ever "mocked the wind with his\nfleetness".\n\nShiva, as we have indicated, developed from Rudra, the storm god. He is first\nmentioned as Mahadeva, "the great god", in the _Yajurveda_ , and in the _Mah\nabharata_ he is sometimes exalted above Vishnu. In one part he is worshipped\nby Krishna. He is the "blue-necked, three-eyed trident-bearing lord of all\ncreatures". The trident is a lightning symbol which appears to have developed\nfrom the three wriggling flashes held in the left hand of hammer-gods like\nTarku and Rammon. Shiva\'s third eye was on his forehead, and from it issued on\noccasion a flame of fire which could consume an enemy; once he slew Kamadeva,\nthe love god, who wounded him with flowery arrows, by causing the flame to\nspring forth.\n\nBalor, the night god of Irish mythology, had similarly a destroying eye; "its\ngaze withered all who stood before it"; 1 he was the god of lightning and\ndeath, the "eye-flame" being the thunderbolt.\n\nShiva\'s dwelling is on the Himalayan mount Kaila\xc2\xb4sa 2. He is Girisha, "the\nlord of the hills", and Chandra-Shekara, "the moon crested", Bhuteswara, "lord\nof goblins", and Sri Kanta, "beautiful throated". When he is depicted with\nfive heads, he is regarded as the source of the five sacred rivers flowing\nfrom the mountains. As the god with snow-white face, he is the spirit of\nasceticism (Maha-Yogi) adored by Brahmans performing penances. In the _Mah\nabharata_ Arjuna, the warrior, invoked him by engaging in austerities until\nsmoke issued from the earth. Then Shiva, "the illustrious Hara", appeared in\nhuge and stalwart form and wrestled with him. Arjuna\'s limbs were bruised and\nhe was deprived of his senses. When he recovered he hailed the god, saying:\n"Thou art\n\np. 147\n\n[paragraph continues] Shiva in the form of Vishnu and Vishnu in the form of\nShiva . . . . 1 O Hari, O Rudra, I bow to thee. Thou hast a (red) eye on thy\nforehead. . . . Thou art the source of universal blessing, the cause of the\ncause of the Universe. . . . Thou art worshipped of all the worlds. I worship\nthee to obtain thy grace. . . . This combat in which I was engaged with thee\n(arose) from ignorance. . . . I seek thy protection. Pardon me all I have\ndone."\n\nShiva, whose sign is the bull, embraced Arjuna and said, "I have pardoned\nthee."\n\nThe god was invoked by another warrior, Ashwattaman; son of Drona. Having\nnaught else to sacrifice, the worshipper flung himself upon the altar fire;\nShiva accepted him and entered his body so as to assist him in slaughtering\nhis sleeping enemies. Bloody rites were at one time associated with Shiva\nworship. As the Destroyer of the Hindu Trinity, he is armed with a discus, a\nsword, a bow, and a club; but his most terrible weapon is the trident.\nSometimes he is clad in the skin of an elephant and sometimes in that of a\nleopard, the tail dangling behind. A serpent, coiled on his head, rears itself\nto strike; another serpent darts from his right shoulder against an enemy.\n\nThe bull symbol, Nandi, the moon crescent on his forehead, and the serpent\ngirdle, indicate that Shiva is a god of fertility. A phallic symbol is\nassociated with his worship. In localities he is adored at the present day in\nthe form of a great boulder painted red which usually stands below a tree.\nOfferings are made to this stone, and women visit it during the period of the\nmoon\'s increase to pray for offspring.\n\nAs Natesa, the dancer, Shiva dances triumphantly on the body of a slain Asura.\nA fine bronze in the Madras\n\np. 148\n\n[paragraph continues] Museum depicts him with four arms, and a beaming,\nbenevolent face, wearing a tiara, and surrounded by a halo of fire; he\nabsorbed the attributes of Agni as well as those of Rudra. He is the destroyer\nof evil and disease, the giver of long life and the god of medicine, and is\naccordingly invoked to cure sickness. Victims of epilepsy are believed to be\npossessed by Shiva.\n\nIn early Puranic times, when Brahmanism was revived and reformed, the worship\nof goddesses came into prominence. This was one of the most pronounced\nfeatures of the anti-Buddhist movement, and was due probably to the influence\nof Great Mother worshippers. In the Vedic Age, as we have seen, the goddesses\nwere vague and shadowy; as wives of the gods they were strictly subordinate,\nreflecting, no doubt, the social customs which prevailed among the Aryans.\nUshas, the dawn, and Ratri, the night, were mainly poetic conceptions. Even\nPrithivi, the Earth Mother, who was symbolized as a cow, played no prominent\npart in Vedic religion: a magical influence was exercised by water goddesses.\nThe male origin of life appears to have been an accepted tenet of Vedic\nbelief. Aditi, mother of the Adityas, is believed to be of more recent origin\nthan her sons. Indra seems to have similarly had existence before his mother,\nlike the other hammer gods, and especially P\'an Ku and Ptah.\n\nFemale water spirits are invariably regarded as givers of boons, inspiration\nand wisdom; holy wells have from remote times been regarded as sources of\nluck; by performing ceremonial acts those who visit them obtain what they wish\nfor in silence; their waters have, withal, curative properties, or they may be\nused for purposes of divination. The name of the goddess Saraswati signifies\n"waters"; she was originally the spirit of the Saraswati river, and was\nprobably identical with Bharati, the goddess\n\n\n\n[![SHIVA DANCING ON TRIPURA<br> <i>From a bronze in the Madras\nMuseum</i>.](tn/14800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/14800.jpg)  \nSHIVA DANCING ON TRIPURA  \n_From a bronze in the Madras Museum_.  \n\n\n\np. 149\n\nof the Vedic Bharata tribe. In Puranic times she became the wife of Brahma and\nthe Minerva of the Hindu Pantheon. She is identical with Vach, "Mother of the\nVedas", the goddess of poetry and eloquence, and Viraj, the female form of\nPurusha, who divided himself to give origin to the gods and demons and all\nliving creatures. When Brahma took for a second wife Gayatri, the milk-maid,\nshe cursed him so that he could only be worshipped once a year.\n\nSaranyu, who may have developed from Ushas, the Dawn, is the bride of Surya,\nthe sun god, and mother of the twin Aswins; she fashioned the trident of Shiva\nand the discus of Vishnu, and other weapons besides.\n\nLakshmi, or Sri, who had her origin at the Churning of the Ocean, became the\nwife of Vishnu, and the goddess of beauty, love, and prosperity. She has had\nseveral human incarnations, and in each case was loved by the incarnation of\nVishnu. She is Sita in the _Ram ayana_, and the beautiful herdswoman beloved\nby Krishna. Lakshmi is "the world-mother, eternal, imperishable; as Vishnu is\nall-pervading, she is omnipresent. Vishnu is meaning, she is speech; Vishnu is\nrighteousness, she is devotion; Sri is the earth, and Vishnu is the support of\nthe earth." This benevolent goddess is usually depicted as a golden lady with\nfour arms, seated on a lotus.\n\nShiva\'s complex character is reflected in the various forms assumed by his\nbride. As the Destroyer he is associated with Durga, who has great beauty and\nis also a war goddess. As Kali she is the black earth-mother, and as\nJagadgauri, the yellow woman, the harvest bride. Armed with Celestial weapons,\nDurga is a renowned slayer of demons. In her Kali form she is of hideous\naspect. Sculptors and painters have depicted her standing on the prostrate\nform of Shiva and grinning with outstretched\n\np. 150\n\ntongue. Her body is smeared with blood because she has waged a ferocious and\nsuccessful war against the giants. Like Shiva, she has a flaming third eye on\nher forehead. Her body is naked save for a girdle of giants\' hands suspended\nfrom her waist; round her neck she wears a long necklace of giants\' skulls:\nlike the Egyptian Isis, Kali can conceal herself in her long and abundant\nhair. She has four arms: in one she holds a weapon, and in another the\ndripping head of a giant; two empty hands are raised to bless her worshippers.\nLike the Egyptian Hathor or Sekhet, the "Eye of Ra", she goes forth to slay\nthe enemies of the gods, rejoicing in slaughter. Like Hathor, too, she is\nasked to desist, but heeds not. Then Shiva approaches her and lies down among\nher victims. Kali dances over the battlefield and leaps on her husband\'s body.\nWhen she observes, however, what she has done, she ejects her tongue with\nshame.\n\nAs Sati, Shiva\'s wife is the ideal of a true and virtuous Hindu woman. When\nSati\'s husband was slighted by her father, the Deva-rishi, Daksha, she cast\nherself on the sacrificial fire. Widows who died on the funeral pyres of their\nhusbands were called Sati 1, because in performing this rite they imitated the\nfaithful goddess.\n\nSati was reborn as Uma, "Light", the impersonation of divine wisdom; as Amvika\nthe same goddess was a sister of Rudra, or his female counterpart, Rudra\ntaking the place of Purusha, the first man. Par\xc2\xb4vati was another form of the\nmany-sided goddess. Shiva taunted her for being black, and she went away for a\ntime and engaged in austerities, with the result that she assumed a golden\ncomplexion.\n\nA trinity of goddesses is formed by Saraswati, the white one, Lakshmi, the red\none, and Par\xc2\xb4vati, the black one. The three were originally one--a goddess who\n\n\n\n[![GANESA<br> <i>From a sculpture in the Victoria and Albert\nMuseum</i>.](tn/15000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/15000.jpg)  \nGANESA  \n_From a sculpture in the Victoria and Albert Museum_.  \n\n(see page 151)\n\n\n\np. 151\n\ncame into existence when Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva spoke of the dreaded Asura,\nAndhaka (Darkness) and looked one at another. The goddess was coloured white,\nred, and black, and divided herself, according to the Varaha Purana, into\nthree forms representing the Past, Present, and Future.\n\nIt was after Sati burned herself that the sorrowing Shiva was wounded by\nKamadeva, the love god, whom he slew by causing a flame of fire to dart from\nhis third eye. This god is the son of Vishnu and Lakshmi. He is usually\ndepicted as a comely youth like the Egyptian Khonsu; he shoots flowery arrows\nfrom his bow; his wife Rati symbolizes Spring, the cuckoo, the humming bee,\nand soft winds. As Manmatha he is the "mind-disturber"; as Mara, "the\nwounder"; as Madan, "he who makes one love-drunk"; and as Pradyumna he is the\n"all-conqueror".\n\nGane\xc2\xb4sa 1, the four-armed, elephant-headed god of wisdom, is the son of Shiva\nand Parvati. He is the general of Shiva\'s army, the patron of learning and the\ngiver of good fortune. At the beginning of books he is invoked by poets, his\nimage is placed on the ground when a new house is built, and he is honoured\nbefore a journey is begun or any business is undertaken. The elephant\'s head\nis an emblem of sagacity. A myth in one of the Puranas relates that the planet\nSaturn, being under a curse, decapitated Ganesa simply by looking at him.\nVishnu mounted on the back of the man-eagle Garuda and came to the child\'s\naid. He cut off the head of Indra\'s elephant and placed it on Ganesa\'s neck.\nIn a conflict with a Deva-rishi Ganesa lost one of his tusks. Several myths\nhave gathered round this popular, elephant-headed deity, who is also\nidentified with the wise rat.\n\np. 152\n\nAnother son of Shiva and Parvati is Kartikeya, the Celestial general and\nslayer of demons. He is also regarded as the son of Agni and the Ganges.\n\nThe goddess of the Ganges is Ganga. This most sacred of all Indian rivers, the\ncleanser of sins and the giver of immortality, was originally confined to the\nCelestial regions, where it flowed from a toe of Vishnu. How it came to earth\nis related in the following myth: Sag\xc2\xb4ara, a King of Ayodha (Oude), had great\ndesire for offspring. He performed penance, with the result that one wife\nbecame the mother of a single son and the other of sixty thousand sons. He\nprepared to perform a horse sacrifice, but Indra stole the sacred animal. All\nthe sons went in search of it by digging each for the depth of a league\ntowards the centre of the earth. They were, however, consumed by the fire of\nKapila, a form of Vishnu, who protected the earth goddess, his bride. Sagara\nwas informed that his sons would come to life again and rise to heaven when\nthe Ganges flowed down to the earth. His grandson went through rigid penances,\nand at length Brahma consented to grant the prayer that the sacred river\nshould descend from the Himalayas. Shiva broke the fall of the waters by\nallowing them to flow through his hair, and they were divided into seven\nstreams. When the waters reached the ashes of the slain princes, their spirits\nrose to heaven and secured eternal bliss. Sagra island, at the mouth of the\nGanges, is invested with great sanctity, on account of its association with\nthe King of Ayodha of this legend. All the Indian rivers are female, with the\nexception of the Sona and Brahmaputra, the spirits of which are male.\n\nOther goddesses include Man\xc2\xb4asa, sister of Vasuka, King of the Nagas, who\ngives protection against snake bites, and is invoked by the serpent\nworshippers: Sasti,\n\n\n\n[![KARTIKEYA, THE WAR GOD<br> <i>From a painting by Surendra Nalh\nGangoly</i>.<br> \\(By permission of the Indian Society of Oriental Art,\nCalcutta\\)](tn/15200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/15200.jpg)  \nKARTIKEYA, THE WAR GOD  \n_From a painting by Surendra Nalh Gangoly_.  \n(By permission of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, Calcutta)  \n\n\n\np. 153\n\nthe feline goddess of maternity and protectress of children, who rides on a\ncat; and Shitala, the Bengali goddess of smallpox, who is mounted on an ass,\ncarries a bundle of reeds in her hand, and is clad in red; she is propitiated\non behalf of victims of the dreaded disease.\n\nA prominent part is played in the Brahmanic mythology of the Restoration\nperiod by the Deva-rishis, the deified Vedic poets, sages, and priests, who\nstand between the Vedic gods and the Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.\n\nOriginally there were seven Deva-rishis, and these were identified with the\nseven stars of the Great Bear, their wives being represented by the Pleiades.\nTheir number was, however, increased in time. 1 Sometimes they visit the earth\nin the form of swans, but more often they are brooding sages who curse gods\nand mortals on receiving the slightest provocation.\n\nOne of the most prominent of these Rishis is Na\xc2\xb4rada 2, who cursed and was\ncursed by Brahma. In the _Mah abharata_ he is a renowned teacher and a\ncounsellor of kings, and also a messenger between Indra and heroes. He is a\npatron of music, and invented the Vina (lute) on which he loves to play. His\ngreat rival is Parvata, who also acts as a Celestial messenger.\n\nDaksha is the father of Sati, the peerless wife of Shiva. It was on account of\nthis rishi\'s quarrel with her husband, who was not invited to a great feast,\nthat she flung herself upon the sacrificial fire. Shiva cut off Daksha\'s head\nand replaced it with the head of a goat.\n\nBhrigu was the patriarch of a Vedic priestly family. He married a daughter of\nDaksha, and was the father of\n\np. 154\n\n[paragraph continues] Lakshmi, wife of Vishnu, who rose from the ocean of\nmilk. Bhrigu once cursed Agni, whom he compelled to consume everything.\nAngiras, Kratu, and Pulaha were Deva-rishis who also married daughters of\nDaksha. Pulastya was a famous slayer of Rakshasas. He once cursed a king who\nrefused to make way for him on a narrow forest path, and the king became a\nRakshasa.\n\nMarichi was the grandfather of the dwarf incarnation of Vishnu, and Atri was\nthe father of the irascible sage Durvasas, a master curser.\n\nVasishtha is sometimes referred to as identical with Vyasa, the reputed\narranger of the Vedas, and author of the _Mah abharata_. He possessed a\nwonderful cow which granted whatever he wished for. A king named Vishwamitra\ndesired to possess this wonderful animal, and when he found that he was unable\nto obtain it by force, he determined to raise himself from the Kshatriya to\nthe Brahman caste by performing prolonged austerities. When Vishwamitra\nsecured this elevation he fought with his rival.\n\nSome Vedic scholars regard Vishwamitra and Vasishtha as actual historical\npersonages. They argue that Vishwamitra was originally a Purohita (family\npriest) in the service of Sudas, the king of an Aryan tribe called the\nTritsus. References are found in the _Rigveda_ to the wars of Sudas, who once\ndefeated a coalition of ten kings. Vishwamitra is believed to have been\ndeposed by Sudas in favour of Vasishtha, and to have allied himself afterwards\nwith the enemies of the Tritsus. 1\n\nProfessor Oldenberg, the German Sanskrit scholar, is convinced, however, that\nthere is no evidence in the _Rigveda_ of the legendary rivalry between\nVishwamitra and Vasishtha. He regards the Vasishthas as the family priests of\nthe Bharata tribe and identical with the Tritsus.\n\n\n\n[![PARVATI, WIFE OF SHIVA<br> <i>From a South Indian\ntemple</i>.](tn/15400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/15400.jpg)  \nPARVATI, WIFE OF SHIVA  \n_From a South Indian temple_.  \n\n(see page 150)\n\n\n\np. 155\n\nAmong the tribes which opposed the advance of the conquering King Sudas, who\nappears to have been a late comer, was the Puru people on the banks of the\nSaraswati river. We find that the early authors suddenly cease to refer to\nthem, and the problem is presented: What fate had befallen the Purus?\nProfessor Oldenberg, whose view is accepted by Professor Macdonell, Oxford,\nexplains that the Purus merged in the Kuru coalition. The Kurus gave their\nname to Kuru-kshetra, the famous battlefield of the epic _Mah abharata_; they\nhad already fused with the Panchala tribe and formed the Kuru-Panchala nation\nin Madhyadesa, the "Middle Country", the home of Brahmanic culture, the\nbirthplace of the famous old _Upanishads_.\n\nThe Bharatas, and their priestly aristocracy of Tritsus, the Vasishthas,\nappear to have joined the Kuru-Panchala confederacy about the time that the\n_Brahmanas_ were being composed, and these were probably influenced by the\nritualistic practices of the Vasishthas. There are references to Agni of the\nBharatas, and a goddess Bharati is mentioned in connection with the Saraswati\nriver.\n\nIt appears highly probable that the Bharatas and the Kuru-Panchalas represent\nlate invasions of peoples who displaced the earlier Aryan settlers in\nHindustan. Among the enemies of the invaders were the Kasis, a tribe which\nbecame associated with Benares. It is not possible to prove the theory that\nthis people had any connection with the Kassites who established a Dynasty at\nBabylon. The Kassites are believed to be identical with the Cossaei of later\ntimes, who were settled between Babylon and the Median highlands. Some think\nthe Kassites came from Asia Minor after the Hittite raid on Babylon, if the\nKassites, as Hittite allies, were not the actual raiders. The fact that the\nMaltese cross, which is found on\n\np. 156\n\n[paragraph continues] Elamite neolithic pottery, first appears on Babylonian\nseals during the Kassite Dynasty, suggests, however, that the Kassites came\nfrom the east and not the west, with the horse, called in Babylon "the ass of\nthe east".\n\nThe great epic _Mah abharata_, "the Iliad of India", may have been founded on\nthe hero songs which celebrated the Aryan tribal wars in India. Its action is\ncentred in Kuru-kshetra, "the country of the Kurus", in which the Bharatas had\nsettled. Two rival families contend for supremacy; these are the Kauravas (the\nKurus) and the Pandavas who are supported by the Panchalas and others. The\nPandavas and Kauravas are cousins and the descendants of the eponymous King\nBharata. In the royal family tree the tribal names of Kuru and Puru appear as\nnames of kings.\n\nA popular rendering is given in several chapters which follow of the epic\nnarrative embedded in the _Mah abharata_, which is about eight times as long\nas the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ combined. This monumental work is divided into\neighteen books; a supplementary nineteenth book alone exceeds in length the\ntwo famous Greek epics.\n\nAs we have stated, the _Mah abharata_ had its origin as an epic prior to B.C.\n500. It was added to from time to time until it assumed its present great\nbulk. The kernel of the narrative, however, which appears to have dealt with\nthe early wars between the Kurus and Panchalas, must be placed beyond B.C.\n1000.\n\nOur narrative begins with the romantic stories which gathered round the names\nof the legendary ancestors of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. The sympathies of\nthe Brahmanic compilers are with the latter, who are symbolized as "a vast\ntree formed of religion and virtue", while their opponents are "a great tree\nformed of passion".\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[141:1](iml13.htm#fr_178) Condensed from Vana Parva section of _Mah abharata_,\nsec. clxxxvii, Roy\'s trans.\n\n[143:1](iml13.htm#fr_179) Va\xc2\xb4suki.\n\n[143:2](iml13.htm#fr_180) Brahma, as Prajapati, assumes, in one of the myths,\nthe form of a tortoise to "create offspring".\n\n[146:1](iml13.htm#fr_181) _Celtic Myth and Legend_ , p. 49.\n\n[146:2](iml13.htm#fr_182) Or Kail\xc4\x81sa.\n\n[147:1](iml13.htm#fr_183) Combined with Vishnu he is Hari-hara.\n\n[150:1](iml13.htm#fr_184) Often spelled Suttee.\n\n[151:1](iml13.htm#fr_185) A familiar Bengali rendering is "Gonesh", which is\noften given as a pet name to an exemplary boy.\n\n[153:1](iml13.htm#fr_186) In _Vishnu Purana_ the Rishis are divided as\nfollows: 1, Brahmarishis, sons of Brahma; 2, Devarishis, semi-divine saints;\n3, Rajarishis, royal saints who had practised austerities.
