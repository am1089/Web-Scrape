On account of the connexion and so on (the agnis built, of mind, &c. are\nindependent); in the same way as other cognitions are separate. And there is\nseen (another case of something having to be withdrawn from the leading\nsubject-matter); this has been explained (in the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras).\n\nIndependence has, against the general subject-matter, to be assumed for the\nfire-altars built of mind and so on, for that reason also that the text\nconnects the constituent\n\np. 265\n\nmembers of the sacrificial action with activities of the mind, &c.; viz. in\nthe passage, 'With mind only they are established, with mind only they are\npiled, with mind only the cups were taken, with mind the udgat _ri_ s praised,\nwith mind the hot _ri_ s recited; whatever work is done at the sacrifice,\nwhatever sacrificial work, was done as consisting of mind, by mind only, at\nthose fire-altars made of mind, piled by mind,' &c. For that connexion has for\nits result an imaginative combination (of certain mental energies with the\nparts of the sacrifice), and the obtainment of the parts of the sacrifice\nwhich are objects of actual perception cannot be made dependent on such\nimaginative combination 1. Nor must it be supposed that, because here also, as\nin the case of the meditation on the udgitha, the vidya is connected with\nmembers of the sacrificial action, it enters into that action as a constituent\npart; for the statements of the text differ in the two cases. For in our case\nscripture does not say that we are to take some member of a sacrificial action\nand then to superimpose upon it such and such a name; but rather takes six and\nthirty thousand different energies of the mind and identifies them with the\nfire-altars, the cups, and so on, just as in some other place it teaches a\nmeditation on man viewed as the sacrifice. The number given by the text is\noriginally observed as belonging to the days of a man's life, and is then\ntransferred to the mental energies connected therewith.--From the connexion\n(referred to in the Sutra) it therefore follows that the agnis piled of mind,\n&c. are independent.--The clause 'and so on' (met with in the Sutra) must be\nexplained as comprehending 'transference' and the like as far as possible. For\nif the text says, 'Each of those Agnis is as great as that prior one,' it\ntransfers the glory of the fire-altar consisting of the work (i.e. the real\naltar piled of bricks) to the altars consisting of knowledge and so on, and\nthereby\n\np. 266\n\nexpresses want of regard for the work. Nor can it be said that if there is\nconnexion (of all the agnis) with the sacrificial action, the later ones (i.e.\nthose made of mind) may optionally be used instead of the original agnis made\nof bricks (as was asserted by the purvapakshin in Sutra 45). For the later\nagnis are incapable of assisting the sacrificial action by means of those\nenergies with which the original agni assists it, viz. by bearing the\nahavaniya fire and so on.--The assertion, again, made by the purvapakshin\n(Sutra 46) that 'transference' strengthens his view in so far as transference\nis possible only where there is equality, is already refuted by the remark\nthat also on our view transference is possible, since the fanciful fire-altars\nare equal to the real fire-altar in so far as both are fire-altars.--And that\ndirect enunciation and so on favour our conclusion has been shown.--From\nconnexion and so on it therefore follows that the agnis piled of mind, &c. are\nindependent.--'As in the case of the separateness of other cognitions.' As\nother cognitions, such as e.g. the Sa _n_ _d_ ilya-vidya, which have each\ntheir own particular connexion, separate themselves from works and other\ncognitions and are independent; so it is in our case also.--Moreover 'there is\nseen' an analogous case of independence from the leading subject-matter. The\noffering called avesh _t_ i which is mentioned in the sacred texts under the\nheading of the ra _g_ asuya-sacrifice, is to be taken out from that heading\nbecause it is connected with the three higher castes, while the ra _g_ asuya\ncan be offered by a member of the warrior caste only. This has been explained\nin the first section (i.e. in the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[265:1](sbe38193.htm#fr_168) Kimartham idam anubandhakara _n_ a _m_ tad aha,\nsampad iti, upastyartho hy anubandhas tathapi mana _s_ _k_ idadinam\nakriya\xe1\xb9\x85gatve kim ayata _m_ tad aha, na _k_ eti, tesha _m_ kriya\xe1\xb9\x85gatve sakshad\nevadhanadiprasiddher anarthika sampad ity artha _h_. \xc3\x82n.
