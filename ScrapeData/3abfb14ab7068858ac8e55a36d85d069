[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n3:2:1\n\n### SECOND ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n3:2:1:11\\. South of the \xc3\x82havaniya he spreads two black antelope skins on the\nground, with the neck parts towards the east: thereon he consecrates him. If\nthere are two (skins), they are an image of these two worlds (heaven and\nearth), and thus he consecrates him on these two worlds.\n\np. 26\n\n3:2:1:22\\. They are joined (fitted) together along their edge 1, for these two\nworlds are also, as it were, joined together at their edge. At the hind part\nthey are fastened together through holes: thus, after uniting (mithunik _ri_\ntya) these two worlds, he consecrates him thereon.\n\n3:2:1:33\\. But if there be only one (skin), then it is an image of these\n(three) worlds; then he consecrates him on these (three) worlds. Those (hairs)\nwhich are white are an image of the sky; those which are black are (an image)\nof this (earth);--or, if he likes, conversely: those which are black are an\nimage of the sky, and those which are white are (an image) of this (earth).\nThose which are of a brownish yellow colour 2, are an image of the atmosphere.\nThus he consecrates him on these (three) worlds.\n\n3:2:1:44\\. And let him, in that case, turn in the hind end (of the skin) 3:\nthus, after uniting these worlds with each other, he consecrates him thereon.\n\n3:2:1:55\\. He then squats down behind the two skins, with his face towards the\neast and with bent (right) knee; and while touching them thus 4 at a place\n\np. 27\n\nwhere the white and black (hair) join, he mutters (Va _g_. S. IV, 9), \'Ye are\nthe images of the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman;\'--an image doubtless is what is\nconformable 1: \'Ye are conformable to, the _ri_ _k_ s and samans\' he thereby\nmeans to say.\n\n3:2:1:66\\. \'I touch you.\' Now, he who is consecrated becomes an embryo, and\nenters into the metres: hence he has his hands closed, since embryos have\ntheir hands closed.\n\n3:2:1:77\\. And when he says, \'I touch you,\' he means to say, \'I enter into\nyou.\' \'Do ye guard me up to the goal of this sacrifice!\' whereby he says, \'Do\nye protect me until the completion of this sacrifice!\'\n\n3:2:1:88\\. He then kneels down with his right knee (on the skin), with the\ntext, \'Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge!\' for the skin ( _k_ arma) of the\nblack deer it is indeed among men, but among the gods it is a refuge ( _s_\narma): therefore he says, \'Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge.\' \'Homage be to\nthee: injure me not!\' Now he who raises himself upon the sacrifice 1 doubtless\nraises himself to one that is his better; for the black deer skin is a (means\nof) sacrifice. Hereby, now, he propitiates that sacrifice, and thus that\nsacrifice does not injure him: for this reason he says, \'Homage be to thee:\ninjure me not!\'\n\n3:2:1:99\\. He must indeed sit down first on the hind part (of the skin). Were\nhe, on the other hand, to sit down at once in the middle (of the skin), and\nwere\n\np. 28\n\nany one there to curse him, saying, \'He shall either become demented or fall\ndown headlong!\' then that would indeed come to pass. Let him therefore first\nsit down on the hind part (of the skin).\n\n3:2:1:1010\\. He then girds himself with the zone. For once upon a time when\nthe A\xe1\xb9\x85giras were consecrated, they were seized with weakness, for they had\nprepared no other food but fast-milk. They then perceived this (source of)\nstrength (viz. the zone), and this (source of) strength they put in (or round)\nthe middle of their body as a (means of attaining) completion: and thereby\nthey attained completion. And so does he now put that (source of) strength in\nthe middle of his body and thereby attain completion.\n\n3:2:1:1111\\. It is made of hemp. Hempen it is in order to be soft. Now when\nPra _g_ apati, having become an embryo, sprung forth from that sacrifice, that\nwhich was nearest to him, the amnion, became hempen threads: hence they smell\nputrid. And that which was the outer membrane (and placenta) became the\ngarment of the consecrated. Now the amnion lies under the outer membrane, and\nhence that (zone) is worn under the garment. And in like manner as Pra _g_\napati, having become an embryo, sprung forth from that sacrifice, so does he\nbecome an embryo and spring forth from that sacrifice.\n\n3:2:1:1212\\. It (the cord) is a triple one, because food is threefold, food\nbeing cattle. (Moreover) the father and mother (are two), and that which is\nborn is a third: hence it is a triple (cord).\n\n3:2:1:1313\\. It is intertwined with a shoot of reed (mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a) grass, for\nthe sake of chasing away the evil spirits, the reed being a thunderbolt. It is\nplaited after\n\np. 29\n\nthe manner of a braid of hair. For were it to be twisted 1 sunwise (from left\nto right) as any other cords, it would be human; and were it twisted contrary\nto the course of the sun, it would be sacred to the Fathers: hence it is\nplaited after the manner of a braid of hair.\n\n3:2:1:1414\\. He girds himself with it, with the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 10),\n\'Thou art the strength of the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras,\'--for the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras perceived this\n(source of) strength; \'soft as wool, bestow thou strength on me!\' there is\nnothing obscure in this.\n\n3:2:1:1515\\. He then tucks up the end of his (nether) garment, with the text,\n\'Thou art Soma\'s tuck.\' For heretofore it was the tuck of him, the\nunconsecrated; but now that he is consecrated, it is that of Soma 2: therefore\nhe says, \'Thou art Soma\'s tuck.\'\n\n3:2:1:1616\\. He then wraps up (his head) 3. For he who is consecrated becomes\nan embryo; and embryos are enveloped both by the amnion and the outer\nmembrane: therefore he covers (his head).\n\n3:2:1:1717\\. He covers himself, with the text, \'Thou art Vish _n_ u\'s refuge,\nthe refuge of the sacrificer.\' He who is consecrated indeed becomes both Vish\n_n_ u and a sacrificer; for when he is consecrated, he is Vish _n_ u; and when\nhe sacrifices, he is the sacrificer: therefore he says, \'Thou art Vish _n_ u\'s\nrefuge, the refuge of the sacrificer.\'\n\n3:2:1:1818\\. Thereupon he ties a black deer\'s horn to the\n\np. 30\n\nend (of his garment 1). Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from\nPra _g_ apati, entered upon their father Pra _g_ apati\'s inheritance: the gods\ncame in for the Mind and the Asuras for Speech. Thereby the gods came in for\nthe sacrifice and Asuras for speech; the gods for yonder (heaven) and the\nAsuras for this (earth).\n\n3:2:1:1919\\. The gods said to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (m., the sacrifice), \'That Va _k_\n(f., speech) is a woman: beckon her, and she will certainly call thee to her.\'\nOr it may be, he himself thought, \'That Va _k_ is a woman: I will beckon her\nand she will certainly call me to her.\' He accordingly beckoned her. She,\nhowever, at first disdained him from the distance: and hence a woman, when\nbeckoned by a man, at first disdains him from the distance. He said, \'She has\ndisdained me from the distance.\'\n\n3:2:1:2020\\. They said, \'Do but beckon her, reverend sir, and she will\ncertainly call thee to her.\' He beckoned her; but she only replied to him, as\nit were, by shaking her head: and hence a woman, when beckoned by a man, only\nreplies to him, as it were, by shaking her head. He said, \'She has only\nreplied to me by shaking her head.\'\n\n3:2:1:2121\\. They said, \'Do but beckon her, reverend sir, and she will\ncertainly call thee to her.\' He beckoned her, and she called him to her; and\nhence a woman at last calls the man to her. He said, \'She has indeed called\nme.\'\n\np. 31\n\n3:2:1:2222\\. The gods reflected, \'That Va _k_ being a woman, we must take care\nlest she should allure him 1.--Say to her, "Come hither to me where I stand!"\nand report to us her having come.\' She then went up to where he was standing.\nHence a woman goes to a man who stays in a well-trimmed (house). He reported\nto them her having come, saying, \'She has indeed come.\'\n\n3:2:1:2323\\. The gods then cut her off from the Asuras; and having gained\npossession of her and enveloped her completely in fire, they offered her up as\na holocaust, it being an offering of the gods 2. And in that they offered her\nwith an anush _t_ ubh verse, thereby they made her their own; and the Asuras,\nbeing deprived of speech, were undone, crying, \'He \'lava _h_! he \'lava _h_\n3!\'\n\np. 32\n\n3:2:1:2424\\. Such was the unintelligible speech which they then uttered,--and\nhe (who speaks thus) is a Mle _k_ _kh_ a (barbarian). Hence let no Brahman\nspeak barbarous language, since such is the speech of the Asuras. Thus alone\nhe deprives his spiteful enemies of speech; and whosoever knows this, his\nenemies, being deprived of speech, are undone.\n\n3:2:1:2525\\. That Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (sacrifice) lusted after Va _k_ (speech 1),\nthinking, \'May I pair with her!\' He united with her.\n\n3:2:1:2626\\. Indra then thought within himself, \'Surely a great monster will\nspring from this union of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a and Va _k_ : [I must take care] lest it\nshould get the better of me.\' Indra himself then became an embryo and entered\ninto that union.\n\n3:2:1:2727\\. Now when he was born after a year\'s time, he thought within\nhimself, \'Verily of great vigour is this womb which has contained me: [I must\ntake care] that no great monster shall be born from it after me, lest it\nshould get the better of me!\'\n\n3:2:1:2828\\. Having seized and pressed it tightly, he tore it off and put it\non the head of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (sacrifice 2);for the black (antelope) is the\nsacrifice: the black deer skin is the same as that sacrifice, and the black\ndeer\'s horn is the same as that womb. And because it was by pressing it\ntightly together that Indra tore out (the womb), therefore it (the horn) is\nbound tightly (to the end of the garment); and as Indra,\n\np. 33\n\nhaving become an embryo, sprang from that union, so is he (the sacrificer),\nafter becoming an embryo, born from that union (of the skin and the horn).\n\n3:2:1:2929\\. He ties it (to the end of the garment) with the open part\nupwards, for it is in this way that the womb bears the embryo. He then touches\nwith it his forehead close over the right eyebrow, with the text, \'Thou art\nIndra\'s womb,\'--for it is indeed Indra\'s womb, since in entering it he enters\nthereby 1, and in being born he is born therefrom: therefore he says, \'Thou\nart Indra\'s womb.\'\n\n3:2:1:3030\\. Thereupon he draws (with the horn) the (\'easterly\') line, with\nthe text, \'Make the crops full-eared!\' Thereby he produces the sacrifice; for\nwhen there is a good year, then there is abundant (material) for sacrifice;\nbut when there is a bad year, then there is not even enough for himself: hence\nhe thereby produces the sacrifice.\n\n3:2:1:3131\\. And let not the consecrated henceforth scratch himself either\nwith a chip of wood or with his nail. For he who is consecrated becomes an\nembryo; and were any one to scratch an embryo either with a chip of wood or\nhis nail, thereby expelling it, it would die 2. Thereafter the consecrated\nwould be liable to be affected with the itch; and--offspring (retas) coming\nafter the consecrated--that offspring would then also be liable to be born\nwith the itch. Now his\n\np. 34\n\nown womb 1 does not injure its offspring, and that black deer\'s horn being\nindeed his own womb, that (horn) does not injure him; and therefore the\nconsecrated should scratch himself with the black deer\'s horn and with nothing\nbut the black deer\'s horn.\n\n3:2:1:3232\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then hands to him a staff, for driving away the\nevil spirits,--the staff being a thunderbolt.\n\n3:2:1:3333\\. It is of Udumbara wood (Ficus Glomerata), for him to obtain food\nand strength,--the Udumbara means food and strength: therefore it is of\nUdumbara wood.\n\n3:2:1:3434\\. It reaches up to his mouth,--for so far extends his strength: as\ngreat as his strength is, so great it (the staff) is when it reaches up to his\nmouth.\n\n3:2:1:3535\\. He makes it stand upright, with the text, \'Stand up, O tree,\nerect; guard me from injury on to the goal of this sacrifice!\' whereby he\nmeans to say, \'Standing erect, protect me till the completion of this\nsacrifice!\'\n\n3:2:1:3636\\. It is only now that some bend the fingers inward 2 and restrain\ntheir speech, because, they argue, only from now will he not have to mutter\nanything. But let him not do so; for in like manner as if one were to try to\novertake some one who runs away, but could not overtake him, so does he not\novertake the sacrifice. Let him therefore turn in his fingers and restrain his\nspeech on that (former) occasion.\n\n3:2:1:3737\\. And when the consecrated (after restraining his speech) utters\neither a _ri_ _k_ , or a saman, or a ya _g_ us 3,\n\np. 35\n\nhe thereby takes a firmer and firmer hold of the sacrifice: let him therefore\nturn in his fingers and restrain his speech on that (former) occasion.\n\n3:2:1:3838\\. And when he restrains his speech--speech being sacrifice--he\nthereby appropriates the sacrifice to himself 1. But when, from speech\nrestrained, he utters any sound (foreign to the sacrifice), then that\nsacrifice, being set free, flies away. In that case, then, let him mutter\neither a _ri_ _k_ or a ya _g_ us addressed to Vish _n_ u, for Vish _n_ u is\nthe sacrifice: thereby he again gets hold of the sacrifice; and this is the\natonement for that (transgression).\n\n3:2:1:3939\\. Thereupon some one 2 calls out, \'Consecrated is this Brahman,\nconsecrated is this Brahman:\' him, being thus announced, he thereby announces\nto the gods: \'Of great vigour is this one who has obtained the sacrifice; he\nhas become one of yours: protect him!\' this is what he means to say. Thrice he\nsays it, for threefold is the sacrifice.\n\n3:2:1:4040\\. And as to his saying, \'Brahman,\' uncertain, as it were, is his\norigin heretofore 3; for the Rakshas, they say, pursue women here oil earth,\nand so the Rakshas implant their seed therein. But he, forsooth, is truly\nborn, who is born of the Brahman (neut.), of the sacrifice: wherefore let him\naddress even a Ra _g_ anya, or a Vai _s_ ya, as Brahman, since he who is born\nof the sacrifice is born of the Brahman (and hence a Brahma _n_ a). Wherefore\nthey say, \'Let no one slay a sacrificer of Soma; for by (slaying) a Soma-\nsacrificer he becomes guilty of a heinous sin 4!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[25:1](sbe2606.htm#fr_75) Saisha mima _m_ saiva, \'This, however, is mere\nspeculation,\' Ka _n_ va recension.\n\n[25:2](sbe2606.htm#fr_76) See I, 2, 5, 14, with note.
