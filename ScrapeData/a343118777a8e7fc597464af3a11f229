When the error is destroyed, the reality of the snake\nthat was seen shines forth as the rope; thus the own-nature of all is the\nSelf.\n\nThe Evolver is the Self, the Pervader is the Self, the Sky-lord is the Self,\nthe Destroyer is the Self; all this universe is the Self; there is nothing but\nthe Self.\n\nInward is the Self, outward also is the Self; the Self is to the east, the\nSelf is also to the west. The Self is to the south, the Self is also to the\nnorth. The Self is above, the Self is beneath.\n\nJust as wave and foam, eddy and bubble are in their own nature water; so, from\nthe body to the personality, all is consciousness, the pure essence of\nconsciousness. [390]\n\nBeing verily is all this world, that is known of voice and mind, there is\nnothing else than Being, standing on nature\'s other shore. Are cup and water-\npot and jar anything but earth? He who is deluded by the wine of glamor speaks\nof "thou" and "I."\n\n"When by repeated effort naught remains but this," the scripture says,\ndeclaring absence of duality, to put an end to false transference of reality.\n\nLike the ether, free from darkness, free from wavering, free from limits, free\nfrom motion, free from change; having neither a within nor a without, having\nno other\n\np. 64\n\nthan it, having no second, is the Self, the supreme Eternal; what else is\nthere to be known?\n\nWhat more is there to be said? The Eternal, the Life, the Self is seen here\nunder many forms; all in this world is the Eternal, the secondless Eternal;\nthe scripture says "I am the Eternal"; knowing this clearly, those whose minds\nare awakened, who have abandoned the outward, becoming the Eternal, dwell in\nthe Self, which is extending consciousness and bliss. This, verily, is sure.\n\nKill out desire that springs up through thought of self in the body formed of\ndarkness, then violent passion in the formal body woven of the breath. Knowing\nthe Self whose fame is sung in the hymns, who is eternal and formed of bliss,\nstand in the being of the Eternal.\n\nAs long as the son of man enjoys this body of death, he is impure; from the\nenemies arises the weariness that dwells in birth and death and sickness. When\nhe knows the pure Self of benign form, immovable, then he is free from\nthese;--thus says the scripture too.\n\nWhen all delusive qualities attributed to the Self are put away, the Self is\nthe supreme eternal, perfect, secondless, changeless.\n\nWhen the activity of the imagination comes to rest in the higher Self, the\nEternal that wavers not, then no more wavering is seen, and vain words only\nremain.\n\nThe belief in this world is, built up of unreality. In the one substance,\nchangeless, formless, undifferentiated, what separateness can exist?\n\nIn the one substance, in which no difference of seer, seeing, seen, exists,\nwhich is changeless, formless, undifferentiated,\n\np. 65\n\nwhat separateness can exist? [400]\n\nIn the one substance, like the world-ocean full to overflowing, changeless,\nformless, undifferentiated, whence can separateness come?\n\nWhere the cause of delusion melts away, like darkness in light, in the\nsecondless, supreme reality, undifferentiated, what separateness can there be?\n\nIn the supreme reality, the very Self of oneness, how could any word of\ndifference dwell? By whom is difference perceived in purely blissful\ndreamlessness?\n\nFor this world no longer is, whether past, present, or to come, after\nawakening to the supreme reality, in the real Self, the Eternal, from all\nwavering free. The snake seen in the rope exists not, nor even a drop of water\nin the desert mirage, where the deer thirsts.\n\nThis duality is mere glamor, for the supreme reality is not twofold; thus the\nscripture says, and it is directly experienced in dreamlessness.\n\nBy the learned it has been perceived that the thing attributed has no\nexistence apart from the substance, as in the case of the serpent and the\nrope. The distinction comes to life through delusion.\n\nThis distinction has its root in imagining; when imagining ceases it is no\nmore. Therefore bring imagining to rest in the higher Self whose form is\nconcealed.\n\nIn soul-vision the wise man perceives in his heart a certain wide-extending\nawakening, whose form is pure bliss, incomparable, the other shore, for ever\nfree, where is no desire, limitless as the ether, partless, from wavering\nfree, the perfect Eternal. t\n\nIn soul-vision the wise man perceives in his heart\n\np. 66\n\nthe reality free from growth and change, whose being is beyond perception, the\nessence of equalness, unequalled, immeasurable, perfectly taught by the words\nof inspiration, eternal, praised by us.\n\nIn soul-vision the wise man perceives in his heart the unfading, undying\nreality, which by its own being can know no setting, like the shimmering water\nof the ocean, bearing no name, where quality and change have sunk to rest,\neternal, peaceful, one. [410]\n\nThrough intending the inner mind to it, gain vision of the Self, in its own\nform, the partless sovereignty. Sever thy bonds that are stained with the\nstain of life, and effortfully make thy manhood fruitful.\n\nStanding in the Self, realize the Self in being, the Self from every disguise\nset free, Being, Consciousness, Bliss, the secondless; thus shalt thou build\nno more for going forth.\n\nThe mighty soul no more regards this body, cast aside like a corpse, seen to\nbe but the shadow of the man, come into being as his reflection, through his\nentering into the result of his works.\n\nDrawing near to the eternal, stainless awakening, whose nature is bliss, put\nvery far away this disguise whose nature is inert and foul; nor let it be\nremembered again at all, for the remembrance of what has been cast forth\nbuilds for disdain.\n\nBurning this up with its root in the flame of the real Self, the unwavering\nEternal, the wise man stands excellent as the Self, through the Self which is\neternal, pure, awakening bliss.\n\nThe body is strung on the thread of works already\n\np. 67\n\ndone, and is impure as the blood of slaughtered kine; whether it goes forward\nor stands, the knower of reality regards it not again, for his life is\ndissolved in the Eternal, the Self of bliss.\n\nKnowing the partless bliss, the Self as his own self, with what desire or from\nwhat cause could the knower of reality cherish the body?\n\nOf the perfect adept this is the fruit, of the seeker for union, free even in\nlife--to taste without and within the essence of being and bliss in the Self.\n\nThe fruit of cleanness is awakening, the fruit of awakening is quiescence;\nfrom realizing the bliss of the Self comes peace, this fruit, verily,\nquiescence bears.\n\nWhen the latter of these is absent, the former is fruitless. The supreme end\nis the incomparable enjoyment of the Self\'s bliss. [420]\n\nThe famed fruit of wisdom is not to tremble before manifest misfortune. The\nvarious works that were done in the season of delusion, worthy of all blame\n-how could a man deign to do them after discernment has been gained?\n\nLet the fruit of wisdom be cessation from unreality, a continuation therein is\nthe fruit of unwisdom;--this is clearly seen. If there be not this difference\nbetween him who knows and him who knows not, as in the presence of the mirage\nto the thirsty deer, where is the manifest fruit of wisdom?\n\nIf the heart\'s knot of unwisdom be destroyed without remainder, how could\nsensual things cause continuance in unreality, in him who has no desire?\n\nWhen mind-images arise not in the presence of sensual\n\np. 68\n\nthings, this is the limit of purity; when the personal idea does not arise,\nthis is the limit of illumination. When life-activity that has been dissolved\ndoes not arise again, this is the limit of quiescence.\n\nHe whose thought is free from outward objects, through standing ever in the\nnature of the Eternal, who is as lightly concerned with the enjoyment of\nsensual things followed by others as a sleeping child, looking on this world\nas a land beheld in dream, when consciousness comes back, enjoying the fruit\nof endless holy deeds, he is rich and worthy of honor in the world.\n\nThis sage, standing firm in wisdom, reaches Being and Bliss, he is changeless,\nfree from all acts, for his Self is dissolved in the Eternal.\n\nBeing that is plunged in the oneness of the Eternal and the Self made pure,\nthat wavers not and is pure consciousness alone, is called wisdom.\n\nThey say he stands firm in wisdom, in whom this wisdom steadfastly dwells. He\nin whom wisdom is firmly established, who enjoys unbroken bliss, by whom the\nmanifested world is almost unheeded, is called free even in life.\n\nHe who with thought dissolved is yet awake, though free from the bondage of\nwaking life, whose illumination is free from impure mind-images, he, verily,\nis called free even in life.\n\nHe who perceives that his soul\'s pilgrimage is ended, who is free from\ndisunion even while possessing division, whose imagination is free from\nimaginings, he, verily, is called free even in life.\n\nHe who even while this body exists, regards it as a\n\np. 69\n\nshadow, who has no sense of personality or possessions--these are the marks of\nhim who is free in life. [430]\n\nWhose mind lingers not over the past, nor goes out after the future, when\nperfect equanimity is gained, this is the mark of him who is free even in\nlife.\n\nIn this world, whose very nature is full of differences, where quality and\ndefect are distinguished, to regard all things everywhere as the same, this is\nthe mark of him who is free even in life.\n\nAccepting wished and unwished objects with equanimity in the Self, and\nchanging not in either event, is the mark of him who is free even in life.\n\nWhen the sage\'s imagination is fixed on tasting the essence of the bliss of\nthe Eternal, so that he distinguishes not between what is within and without,\nthis is the mark of him who is free even in life.\n\nWho is free from thought of "I" and "my," in body and senses and their works,\nwho stands in equanimity, bears the mark of one who is free even in life.\n\nHe who has discerned the Eternal in the Self, through the power of sacred\nbooks, who is free from the bondage of the world, bears the mark of one who is\nfree even in life.\n\nHe who never identifies himself with the body and senses, nor separates\nhimself in thought from what is other than these, bears the mark of one who is\nfree even in life.
