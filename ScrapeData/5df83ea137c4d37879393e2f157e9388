Pra _g_ apati said: \'The Self which is free from sin, free from old age,\nfrom death and grief, from hunger and thirst, which desires nothing but what\nit ought to desire, and imagines nothing but what it ought to imagine, that it\nis which we must search out, that it is which we must try to understand. He\nwho has searched out that Self and understands it, obtains all worlds and all\ndesires.\'\n\n2\\. The Devas (gods) and Asuras (demons) both heard these words, and said:\n\'Well, let us search for that Self by which, if one has searched it out, all\nworlds and all desires are obtained.\'\n\nThus saying Indra went from the Devas, Viro _k_ ana from the Asuras, and both,\nwithout having communicated with each other, approached Pra _g_ apati,\n\np. 135\n\nholding fuel in their hands, as is the custom for pupils approaching their\nmaster.\n\n3\\. They dwelt there as pupils for thirty-two years. Then Pra _g_ apati asked\nthem: \'For what purpose have you both dwelt here?\'\n\nThey replied: \'A saying of yours is being repeated, viz. "the Self which is\nfree from sin, free from old age, from death and grief, from hunger and\nthirst, which desires nothing but what it ought to desire, and imagines\nnothing but what it ought to imagine, that it is which we must search out,\nthat it is which we must try to understand. He who has searched out that Self\nand understands it, obtains all worlds and all desires." Now we both have\ndwelt here because we wish for that Self.\'\n\nPra _g_ apati said to them: \'The person that is seen in the eye 1, that is the\nSelf. This is what I have said. This is the immortal, the fearless, this is\nBrahman.\'\n\nThey asked: \'Sir, he who is perceived in the water, and he who is perceived in\na mirror, who is he?\'\n\nHe replied: \'He himself indeed is seen in all these 2.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[134:1](sbe01166.htm#fr_342) Prasna Up. II, 1.\n\n[134:2](sbe01166.htm#fr_343) The same verse occurs in the Ka _th_ a 6, 16, and\nis frequently quoted elsewhere, for instance, Mait. comm. p. 164. For vishva\n_nn_ , the right reading would seem to be vishvak. In the Mait. Up. VI, 30,\nthe Trish _t_ ubh are reduced to Anush _t_ ubh verses. See also Prasna Up.\nIII, 6-7; Mu _n_ _d_. Up. II, 2.\n\n[134:3](sbe01167.htm#fr_344) Here the highest problem is treated again, the\nknowledge of the true Self, which leads beyond the world of Brahma (masc.),\nand enables the individual self to return into the Highest Self.\n\n[135:1](sbe01167.htm#fr_345) The commentator explains this rightly. Pra _g_\napati means by the person that is seen in the eye, the real agent of seeing,\nwho is seen by sages only, even with their eyes shut. His pupils, however,\nmisunderstand him. They think of the person that is seen, not of the person\nthat sees (Yoga-sutras II, 6). The person seen in the eye is to them the small\nfigure imaged in the eye, and they go on therefore to ask, whether the image\nin the water or in a mirror is not the Self.\n\n[135:2](sbe01167.htm#fr_346) The commentators are at great pains to explain\nthat Pra _g_ apati told no falsehood. He meant by purusha the personal element\nin the highest sense, and it was not his fault that his pupils took purusha\nfor man or body.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 8](sbe01168.htm)\n\n'
