 \nThen with his pupil humbly bent  \nBefore the saint most eloquent.  \nThus honoured and dismissed the seer  \nDeparted to his heavenly sphere.  \nThen from his cot Valmiki hied  \nTo Tamasa's  1 sequestered side,  \nNot far remote from Gangaa's tide.  \nHe stood and saw the ripples roll  \nPellucid o'er a pebbly shoal.  \nTo Bharadvaja  2 by his side  \nHe turned in ecstasy, and cried:  \n'See, pupil dear, this lovely sight,  \nThe smooth-floored shallow, pure and bright,  \nWith not a speck or shade to mar,  \nAnd clear as good men's bosoms are.  \nHere on the brink thy pitcher lay,  \nAnd bring my zone of bark, I pray.  \nHere will I bathe: the rill has not,  \nTo lave the limbs a fairer spot.  \nDo quickly as I bid, nor waste  \nThe precious time; away, and haste.'  \n   Obedient to his master's best  \nQuick from the cot he brought the vest;  \nThe hermit took it from his hand,  \nAnd tightened round his waist the band;  \nThen duly dipped and bathed him there,  \nAnd muttered low his secret prayer.  \nTo spirits and to Gods he made  \nLibation of the stream, and strayed  \nViewing the forest deep and wide  \nThat spread its shade on every side.  \nClose by the bank he saw a pair  \nOf curlews sporting fearless there.  \nBut suddenly with evil mind  \nAn outcast fowler stole behind,  \nAnd, with an aim too sure and true,  \nThe male bird near the hermit slew.  \n\nThe wretched hen in wild despair  \nWith fluttering pinions beat the air,  \nAnd shrieked a long and bitter cry  \nWhen low on earth she saw him lie,  \nHer loved companion, quivering, dead,  \nHis dear wings with his lifebiood red;  \nAnd for her golden crested mate  \nShe mourned, and was disconsolate.  \n   The hermit saw the slaughtered bird,  \nAnd all his heart with ruth was stirred.  \nThe fowler's impious deed distressed  \nHis gentle sympathetic breast,  \nAnd while the curlew's sad cries rang  \nWithin his ears, the hermit sang:  \n'No fame be thine for endless time,  \nBecause, base outcast, of thy crime,  \nWhose cruel hand was fain to slay  \nOne of this gentle pair at play!'  \nE'en as he spoke his bosom wrought  \nAnd laboured with the wondering thought  \nWhat was the speech his ready tongue  \nHad uttered when his heart was wrung.  \nHe pondered long upon the speech,  \nRecalled the words and measured each,  \nAnd thus exclaimed the saintly guide  \nTo Bharadvaja by his side:  \n'With equal lines of even feet,  \nWith rhythm and time and tone complete,  \nThe measured form of words I spoke  \nIn shock of grief be termed a s'loke.'  1b  \nAnd Bharadvaja, nothing slow  \nHis faithful love and zeal to show,  \nAnswered those words of wisdom, 'Be  \nThe name, my lord, as pleases thee.'  \n   As rules prescribe the hermit took  \nSome lustral water from the brook.  \nBut still on this his constant thought  \nKept brooding, as his home he sought;  \nWhile Bharadvaja paced behind,  \nA pupil sage of lowly mind,  \nAnd in his hand a pitcher bore  \nWith pure fresh water brimming o'er.  \nSoon as they reached their calm retreat  \nThe holy hermit took his seat;  \nHis mind from worldly cares recalled,  \nAnd mused in deepest thought enthralled.  \n   Then glorious Brahma,  2b Lord Most High.  \nCreator of the earth and sky,  \n\np. 8  \n\nThe four-faced God, to meet the sage  \nCame to Valmiki's hermitage.  \nSoon as the mighty God he saw,  \nUp sprang the saint in wondering awe.  \nMute, with clasped hands, his head he bent,  \nAnd stood before him reverent.  \nHis honoured guest he greeted well,  \nWho bade him of his welfare tell;  \nGave water for his blessed feet,  \nBrought offerings, 1 and prepared a seat,  \nIn honoured place the God Most High  \nSate down, and bade the saint sit nigh.  \nThere sate before Valmiki's eyes  \nThe Father of the earth and skies;  \nBut still the hermit's thoughts were bent  \nOn one thing only, all intent  \nOn that poor curlew's mournful fate  \nLamenting for her slaughtered mate;  \nAnd still his lips, in absent mood,  \nThe verse that told his grief, renewed:  \n'Woe to the fowler's impious hand  \nThat did the deed that folly planned;  \nThat could to needless death devote  \nThe curlew of the tuneful throat!'  \n   The heavenly Father smiled in glee,  \nAnd said, 'O best of hermits', see,  \nA verse, unconscious thou hast made;  \nNo longer be the task delayed.  \nSeek not to trace, with labour vain,  \nThe unpremeditated strain.  \nThe tuneful lines thy lips rehearsed  \nSpontaneous from thy bosom burst,  \nThen come, O best of seers, relate  \nThe life of Rama good and great,  \nThe tale that saintly Narad told,  \nIn all its glorious length unfold.  \nOf all the deeds his arm has done  \nUpon this earth, omit not one,  \nAnd thus the noble life record  \nOf that wise, brave, and virtuous lord.  \n\nHis every act to day displayed,  \nHis secret life to none betrayed:  \nHow Lakshman, how the giants fought;  \nWith high emprise and hidden thought:  \nAnd all that Janak's child  [1b](ry005.htm#fn_48) befell  \nWhere all could see, where none could tell,  \nThe whole of this shall truly be  \nMade known, O best of saints, to thee.  \nIn all thy poem, through my grace,  \nNo word of falsehood shall have place.  \nBegin the story, aud rehearse  \nThe tale divine in charming verse.  \nAs long as in this firm-set land  \nThe streams shall flow, the mountains stand,  \nSo long throughout the world, be sure,  \nThe great Ramayan shall endure. [2b](ry005.htm#fn_49)  \nWhile the Ramayan's ancient strain  \nShall glorious in the earth remain,  \nTo higher spheres shalt thou arise  \nAnd dwell with me above the skies!  \n   He spoke, and vanished into air,  \nAnd left Valmiki wondering there.  \nThe pupils of the holy man,  \nMoved by their love of him, began  \nTo chant that verse, and ever more  \nThey marvelled as they sang it o'er:  \n'Behold, the four-lined balanced rime,  \nRepeated over many a time,  \nIn words that from the hermit broke  \nIn shock of grief, becomes a s'loke.'  \nThis measure now Valmiki chose  \nWherein his story to compose.  \nIn hundreds of such verses, sweet  \nWith equal lines and even feet,  \nThe saintly poet, lofty-souled,  \nThe glorious deeds of Rama told.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[7:1](ry004.htm#fr_43) There are several rivers in India of this name, now\ncorrupted into _Tarse_. The river here spoken of is that which falls into the\nGanges a little below Allahabad.\n\n[7:2](ry004.htm#fr_44) In Book II, Canto LIV, we meet with a saint of this\nname presiding over a convent of disciples in his hermitage at the confluence\nof the Ganges and the Jumna. Thence the later author of these introductory\ncantos has borrowed the name and person, inconsistently indeed, but with the\nintention of enhancing the dignity of the poet by ascribing to him so\ncelebrated a disciple. SCHLEGEL\n\n[7:1b](ry004.htm#fr_45) The poet plays upon the similarity in sound of the two\nwords: _s'oka_ , means grief, _s'loka_ , the heroic measure in which the poem\nis composed. It need scarcely be said that the derivation is fanciful.\n\n[7:2b](ry004.htm#fr_46) Brahma, the Creator, is usually regarded as the first\nperson of the divine triad of India. Tne four heads with which he is\nrepresented are supposed to have allusion to the four corners of the earth\nwhich he is sometimes considered to personify. As an object of adoration\nBrahma has been entirely superseded by S'iva and Vishnu. In the whole of India\nthere is, I believe, but one temple dedicated to his worship. In this point\nthe first of the Indian triad curiously resembles the last of the divine\nfraternity of Greece, Aides the brother of Zeus and Foseidon. 'In all Greece,\nsays Pausanias, there is no single temple of Aides except at a single spot in\nEhs. See Gladstone's Juventus Mundi, p. 253.\n\n[8:1](ry004.htm#fr_47) The _argha_ or _arghya_ was a libation or offering to a\ndeity, a Brahman, or other venerable personage. According to one authority it\nconsisted of water, milk, the points of Kusa-grass, curds, clarified butter,\nrice, barley, and white mustard, according to another, of saffron, bel,\nunbroken grain, flowers, curds, durba-grass, kusa-grass, and sesamum.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto III.: The Argument.](ry005.htm)\n\n"
