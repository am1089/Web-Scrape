And on account of the impossibility of the connexion (of the Lord with\nthe souls and the pradhana).\n\nAgainst the doctrine which we are at present discussing there lies the further\nobjection that a Lord distinct from the pradhana and the souls cannot be the\nruler of the latter without being connected with them in a certain way. But of\nwhat nature is that connexion to be? It cannot be conjunction (sa _m_ yoga),\nbecause the Lord, as well as the pradhana and the souls, is of infinite extent\nand devoid of parts. Nor can it be inherence, since it would be impossible to\ndefine who should be the abode and who the abiding thing. Nor is it possible\nto assume some other connexion, the special nature of which would have to be\ninferred from the effect, because the relation of cause and effect is just\nwhat is not settled as yet 1.--How, then, it may be asked, do you--the\nVedantins--establish the relation of cause and effect (between the Lord and\nthe world)?--There is, we reply, no difficulty in our case, as the connexion\nwe assume is that of identity (tadatmya). The adherent of Brahman, moreover,\ndefines the nature of the cause, and so on, on the basis of Scripture, and is\ntherefore not obliged to render his tenets throughout conformable to\nobservation. Our adversary, on the other hand, who defines the nature of the\ncause and the like according to instances furnished by experience,\n\np. 437\n\nmay be expected to maintain only such doctrines as agree with experience. Nor\ncan he put forward the claim that Scripture, because it is the production of\nthe omniscient Lord, may be used to confirm his doctrine as well as that of\nthe Vedantin; for that would involve him in a logical see-saw, the omniscience\nof the Lord being established on the doctrine of Scripture, and the authority\nof Scripture again being established on the omniscience of the Lord.--For all\nthese reasons the Sa _n_ khya-yoga hypothesis about the Lord is devoid of\nfoundation. Other similar hypotheses which likewise are not based on the Veda\nare to be refuted by corresponding arguments.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[436:1](sbe34214.htm#fr_421) The special nature of the connexion between the\nLord and the pradhana and the souls cannot be ascertained from the world\nconsidered as the effect of the pradhana acted upon by the Lord; for that the\nworld is the effect of the pradhana is a point which the Vedantins do not\naccept as proved.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 39](sbe34215.htm)\n\n'
