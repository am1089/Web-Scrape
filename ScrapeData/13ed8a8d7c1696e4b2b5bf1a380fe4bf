b"[![](../../cdshop/cdinfo.jpg)](../../cdshop/index.htm)  \n[Sacred Texts](../../index.htm)  [Hinduism](../index.htm)  [Index](index.htm)\n[Previous](sbe0857.htm)  [Next](sbe0859.htm)\n\n* * *\n\n# CHAPTER XXXI\n\nBrahman said .\n\nThus 1 duly studying to the best of his power, in the way above 2 stated, and\nlikewise living as a Brahma _k_ arin, one who is devoted to his own. duty and\nlearned, who is a sage with all his senses restrained, who applies himself to\nwhat is agreeable and beneficial to the preceptor, who is pure 3, and constant\nin veracity and piety, should, with the permission of the preceptor, take food\nwithout decrying it 4, should eat (the leavings) of sacrificial offerings, and\nalms, and should stand, sit, and take exercise 5 (duly), should sacrifice\ntwice to the fire after becoming clean and with a concentrated (mind), and\nshould always bear a staff of the Bilva or Pala _s_ a 6 (wood). The clothing\nof the twice-born (man) should be of linen, or of cotton, or also a deerskin,\nor a cloth entirely (dyed with) reddish colour. There should also be a girdle\nof mu\xc3\xb1 _g_ a; he should have matted hair, and likewise always (carry) water\n(with him), and have his sacred thread, be engaged in sacred\n\np. 361\n\nstudy, and free from avarice, and of rigid observances. (Such) a Brahma _k_\narin, always making offerings likewise of pure water to satisfy the deities,\nbeing restrained in mind 1, is esteemed. One who is thus devoted 2, who is\nconcentrated in mind, and continent 3, conquers heaven, and reaching the\nhighest seat, does not return to birth. Refined by means of all ceremonies,\nand likewise living as a Brahma _k_ arin 4, a sage who has renounced 5 (all)\nshould go out of towns and dwell in forests 6. Wearing a skin or the bark of a\ntree, he should bathe (every) morning and evening, and always living within\nthe forest, should not enter a town again. He should honour guests, and should\nalso give them shelter at (the proper) time, living on fruits and leaves, and\nroots and _S_ yamaka grain. He should without sloth feed on water, air, and\nall forest-products down to grass as they come, in order 7, in accordance with\nthe (regulations 8 at his) initiation. He should honour a guest who comes, by\n(giving him) water accompanied with roots, fruits, and leaves. And he should\nalways without sloth give alms out of whatever he has for food. He should also\neat always after the deities and guests 9\n\np. 362\n\n(are satisfied) and with his speech restrained, having a mind free from envy\n1, eating little, and depending on the deities. Restraining the external\nsenses, kind, full of forgiveness, preserving his hair and moustache,\nperforming sacrifices, addicted to sacred study, and devoted to veracity and\npiety, pure in body 2, always dexterous 3, always in forests, and concentrated\nin mind,--a forester whose senses are subdued and who is thus devoted 4\nconquers the worlds. A householder, or a Brahma _k_ arin, or again a forester,\nwho wishes to apply himself to final emancipation should adopt the best (line\nof) conduct 5. Offering safety to all beings, the sage should become free from\nall action 6, and be agreeable to all beings, kind, and restrained in all his\nsenses. He should make a fire 7 and feed on the alms (obtained) without asking\n8 and without trouble 9, and which have come spontaneously 10, in a place free\nfrom smoke and where people have already 11 eaten. One who\n\np. 363\n\nunderstands final emancipation should seek to obtain alms after the cleaning 1\nof the vessels (used for cooking), and should not rejoice if he obtains, and\nshould not be dejected if he does not obtain (alms). Nor should he beg for too\nmuch alms 2, seeking merely to sustain life. Eating only a little, he should\ngo about for alms with a concentrated mind, looking out for the (proper) time.\nHe should not wish for earnings in common with another, nor should he eat when\nhonoured; for an ascetic should be averse from all earnings (accompanied) with\nhonour 3. When eating, he should not taste any articles of food which have\nbeen eaten by others 4, or which are pungent, astringent, or bitter, and\nlikewise no sweet juices. He should eat just enough for his livelihood-for the\nsupport of life. One who understands final emancipation should seek for a\nlivelihood without obstructing (other) creatures; and when he goes about for\nalms, he should not go following after another 5. He should not parade (his)\npiety, he should move about in a secluded place, free from passion. He should\nresort for shelter to an empty house, or a forest, or the foot of a tree, or a\nriver likewise, or the cavern of a mountain. In summer, (he should pass) but a\nsingle night 6 in a town; and in the rains, he may dwell in one place. He\nshould move about the\n\np. 364\n\nworld like a worm 1, his path being pointed out by the sun, and he should walk\nwith circumspection over the earth out of compassion to all beings 2. He\nshould not make any accumulations; and should eschew dwelling with friends 3.\nAnd the man who understands final emancipation should verily do all acts which\nhe has to do, always with clean water. A man should always bathe in clean\nwater. And with his senses restrained, he should devote himself to these eight\nobservances 4\\--harmlessness, life as a Brahmakarin, veracity, and also\nstraightforwardness, freedom from anger, freedom from (the habit of) carping,\nrestraint of the external organs, and habitual freedom from (the habit of)\nbackbiting. He should always practice a sinless (mode of) conduct, not\ndeceptive and not crooked; and free from attachment should always make one who\ncomes (as a guest) take a morsel of food. He should eat just enough for\nlivelihood-for the support of life. And he should eat (only) what has been\nobtained with piety 5, and should not follow his own (mere) desire 6. He\nshould not accept anything at all other than food and clothing. And he should\naccept as much as he eats and no more. He should not receive from others, nor\nshould he ever give to others 7.\n\np. 365\n\n[paragraph continues] But owing to the helplessness of people, a wise man\nshould always share (with others). He should not appropriate another's riches,\nand should not take (anything) unasked. Nor, verily, after enjoying any object\nshould one become afterwards attached to it. One who has anything to do 1\nshould take earth, water, pebbles likewise, and leaves, flowers, and fruits\nwhich are not secured 2 (by anybody), as they come 3. One should not live by\nthe occupation of an artisan 4, nor should one wish for gold. One should not\nhate, should not teach 5, and should be void of (all) belongings 6. One should\neat what is consecrated by faith 7, and should avoid (all) controversies,\nshould act without a purpose 8, should be free from attachment, and without\nfixed appointments with people 9. One should not perform, or cause to be\nperformed, any action involving expectation of fruit, or involving any\ndestruction of life, or the assemblage of people 10. Rejecting all things,\n\np. 366\n\nand being equable to all beings, moving and unmoving, one should become an\nascetic with small belongings. One should not perturb any other (person), nor\nshould one be perturbed by any other (person 1). He who is trusted by all\nbeings is said to be the foremost among those who understand final\nemancipation. One should not think of what is not come 2, nor reflect on that\nwhich is past; one should disregard the present, being concentrated (in mind)\nand indifferent to time 3. He should not defile 4 anything by the eye, or the\nmind, or by speech, nor should he do anything wrong openly or in secret. One\nwho draws in the senses from all sides as a tortoise (draws in) his limbs 5,\nand in whom the senses, mind, and understanding are absorbed 6, who is free\nfrom desires, who understands all truth, who is free from the pairs of\nopposites, and from the ceremony of svaha, and who is free from salutations 7,\nand who is free from (the thought that this or that is) mine, who is free from\negoism, who is free from anxiety for new acquisitions or protection of old\nacquisitions, and self-controlled 8, who is free from\n\np. 367\n\nexpectations, who is free from attachments to any entity, and who is dependent\non none 1, who is attached to the self, and who understands the truth, is\nemancipated, there is no doubt of that. Those who perceive the self, which is\nwithout hands, foot, or back, without a head, without a stomach, which is free\nfrom the operations of the qualities 2, absolute, untainted, and stable,\ndevoid of smell, devoid of taste or touch, devoid. of colour, and also devoid\nof sound, which is to be understood 3, which is unattached, and which is also\ndevoid of flesh, which is free from anxiety 4, imperishable, divine, and\nthough dwelling in a house 5, always dwelling in all entities, they never die\n6. There the understanding reaches not, nor the senses, nor the deities, nor\nVedas, sacrifices, nor worlds 7, nor penance., nor valour 8; the attainment to\nit of those who are possessed of knowledge is stated to be without\ncomprehension of symbols 9. Therefore the learned man who knows (the) property\nof being void of symbols 10, being devoted to pious conduct, and\n\np. 368\n\nresorting to concealed 1 piety should adopt the mode of life (necessary) for\nexperience 2. Though undeluded, he should act in the manner of the deluded 3,\nnot finding fault with piety 4. He should perform piety, behaving so that\nothers would always disrespect him 5, and should not find fault with the ways\nof the good 6. That sage is said to be the best who has adopted this (line of)\nconduct. The senses, and the objects of the senses, and the five great\nelements, and mind, understanding, egoism, the unperceived, and the Purusha\nlikewise 7, by an accurate determination about the truth, after understanding\nall these, one attains heaven 8, being released from all bonds. One who knows\nthe truth, understanding these same (entities) at the time of the termination\n(of his life), should meditate, exclusively pondering on one point 9; and\nthen, depending on none 10, he gets emancipation. Freed from all attachments,\nlike the atmosphere dwelling in space 11, with his accumulations 12 exhausted,\nand free from distress 13, he attains to the highest seat.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[360:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1820) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, 'Having described\nfirst the order of householder, as that is the chief, he now describes that of\nBrahmakarin.' Cf. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 21, 1, and note.\n\n[360:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1821) Where? This is obscure.\n\n[360:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1822) Both internally and externally, I presume.\n\n[360:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1823) Cf. Taittiriya, p. 129; _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha),\nchap. 192, st. 6.\n\n[360:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1824) Cf. Gita, [p. 69](sbe0808.htm#page_69). Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra says, 'Having exercise by means of standing and sitting; the\nmeaning is not sleeping except at the proper time.'\n\n[360:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1825) Cf. Manu II, 41 seq.\n\n[361:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1826) Or it may be, 'being self-restrained and with\n(all his) heart.' The constructions in the original vary greatly, and so they\ndo in the translation.\n\n[361:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1827) Applying himself to his duties.\n\n[361:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1828) Cf. Maitri, p. 18, and comment there.\n\n[361:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1829) Cf. Manu VI, 1 seq.\n\n[361:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1830) I. e. who is a mendicant ascetic.\n\n[361:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1831) Cf. [p. 173](sbe0824.htm#page_173) supra, note\n[9](sbe0824.htm#fn_810). Here he gives a. description of the third order of\nforester, as to which compare generally Manu VI.\n\n[361:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1832) First the jungle-products, then air, &c., Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra. The sense seems to be that the restrictions should become\ngradually harder. Cf. Manu VI, 24-31; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 22, 2 seq.; II, 9, 23,\n2.\n\n[361:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1833) I. e. whatever restriction he put on himself when\nentering upon the particular mode of life.\n\n[361:9](sbe0858.htm#fr_1834) Supra, [p. 358](sbe0857.htm#page_358), and cf.\nTaittiriya, p. 38.\n\n[362:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1835) I. e. of others for obtaining more, and so forth.\nAr _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's reading is different, and he renders it to mean, 'one\nby whom the rule of life as a Brahma _k_ arin has not been violated.'\n\n[362:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1836) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's reading, 'one who has cast\naway (all attachment to) the body.' Compare as to hair and moustache, Manu VI,\n6 seq.\n\n[362:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1837) See Gita, [p. 127](sbe0820.htm#page_127). Here\nthe meaning is probably assiduous in the performance of duties, vows, and so\nforth.\n\n[362:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1838) I. e. applies himself to his duties.\n\n[362:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1839) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says this means ananda _s_\nramam, but there must be some bad copying here. I take the word as it stands\nto mean something like the 'godlike endowments' at Gita, [p.\n114](sbe0817.htm#page_114).\n\n[362:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1840) See Gita, pp. [54](sbe0805.htm#page_54),\n[127](sbe0820.htm#page_127). The meaning here is probably that of action\nwithout egoism. See Gita, [p. 55](sbe0805.htm#page_55).\n\n[362:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1841) I. e. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, 'not at night.'\nThe readings are unsatisfactory. I read k _ri_ tva vahnim, but diffidently. Is\nthe allusion to the rule at \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 2 1, 10? Cf. Gautama III, 2 7.\n\n[362:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1842) Cf. Kaushitaki, p. 32.\n\n[362:9](sbe0858.htm#fr_1843) I. e. to the giver. Cf. Gita, [p.\n120](sbe0819.htm#page_120).\n\n[362:10](sbe0858.htm#fr_1844) See Gita, [p. 10](sbe0802.htm#page_10).\n\n[362:11](sbe0858.htm#fr_1845) Cf. Manu VI, 56; Gautama III, 15.\n\n[363:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1846) I. e., I presume, in order to avoid interfering\nwith others' comforts. And see last note.\n\n[363:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1847) See Manu VI, 55. As to proper time further on,\nsee last note.\n\n[363:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1848) Cf. Sanatsu _g_ atiya, pp.\n[45](sbe0804.htm#page_45)-[147](sbe0821.htm#page_147); 'without respect' at\nGita, [p. 120](sbe0819.htm#page_120), means probably with disrespect,\notherwise that passage and this would be somewhat inconsistent. See too Manu\nII, 162.\n\n[363:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1849) Cf. Manu II, 56; Gita, [p.\n118](sbe0819.htm#page_118); and [p. 269](sbe0834.htm#page_269) supra.\n\n[363:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1850) As that other may get nothing if they go\ntogether, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra Cf. Manu VI, 51.\n\n[363:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1851) Cf. Gautama III, 21.\n\n[364:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1852) I. e. not very fast, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra; 'the\npath being pointed out by the sun' = not at night, for fear of destroying\nworms, &c.\n\n[364:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1853) This seems to be very like the practice of the\nGainas of the present day. And cf. Manu VI, 69.\n\n[364:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1854) Cf. Gita, pp.\n[68](sbe0808.htm#page_68)-[103](sbe0815.htm#page_103).\n\n[364:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1855) Cf. Gita, [p. 114](sbe0817.htm#page_114), and cf.\nalso Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p. 153](sbe0823.htm#page_153).\n\n[364:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1856) That is to say, obtained without violation of any\nbinding obligation, or rule of the Sastras.\n\n[364:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1857) Cf. Gita, [p. 117](sbe0818.htm#page_117).\n\n[364:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1858) This is not very clear, and Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra's comments are not intelligible. The sense seems to be this, 'He should not\ntake more than is wanted, nor should he keep any accumulations from which to\ngive to others, but should at once share with others all that is earned.'\n\n[365:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1859) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says that this means if he\nwants them for any particular purpose he should take the earth, &c.\n\n[365:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1860) I. e. apparently, taken possession of and\npreserved as one's own by anybody.\n\n[365:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1861) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra renders this by 'which lead\nto action.' Is it not rather the 'spontaneous earnings' at Gita, [p.\n60](sbe0806.htm#page_60)?\n\n[365:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1862) Cf. Manu III, 64; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 6, 18, 18; Gautama\nXVII, 7.\n\n[365:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1863) I. e. teach one who does not ask to be\ninstructed. Cf. Manu II, 110.\n\n[365:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1864) Cf. Gita, [p. 60](sbe0806.htm#page_60); the\noriginal word, however, is not the same.\n\n[365:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1865) See [p. 360](sbe0857.htm#page_360), note  3\nsupra; Manu II, 54-55; Gautama IX) 59. 'Controversies;' the original is\nnimitta, and the interpretation is what appears to be Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's.\nIt may also mean 'omens.' That this is the true sense appears from Manu VI,\n50.\n\n[365:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1866) Cf. Gita, [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48).\n\n[365:9](sbe0858.htm#fr_1867) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, 'e. g. I shall come to\nyou to-morrow for alms,' &c. Cf. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 6, 19, 12.\n\n[365:10](sbe0858.htm#fr_1868) The words are the same as at Gita, [p.\n54](sbe0805.htm#page_54), keeping people (to p. 366 their duties),' but the\nsense seems to be different. The commentators say nothing on this.\n\n[366:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1869) Cf. Gita, [p. 101](sbe0814.htm#page_101).\n\n[366:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1870) I. e. one should not look to the future with any\naspirations or expectations, and should not look back on the past with grief.\nAr _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. See too [p. 170](sbe0824.htm#page_170), note\n[9](sbe0824.htm#fn_784) supra.\n\n[366:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1871) I am not sure if this is a correct\ninterpretation. But it does not seem likely that the other possible sense--\nliterally 'expecting time'--can be intended here.\n\n[366:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1872) This is obscure. Is the sense this, that one\nshould not observe, or think, or speak badly or of the bad side of things?\n\n[366:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1873) Cf. [p. 342](sbe0854.htm#page_342) supra, note\n[1](sbe0854.htm#fn_1670).\n\n[366:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1874) Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 151.\n\n[366:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1875) See [p. 352](sbe0855.htm#page_352) supra, note\n[1](sbe0856.htm#fn_1749).\n\n[366:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1876) Cf. Gita, [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48), where the\noriginal words are the same.\n\n[367:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1877) Cf. Gita, [p. 60](sbe0806.htm#page_60).\n\n[367:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1878) These are effects of Prak _ri_ ti by which the\nPurusha is unaffected.\n\n[367:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1879) Literally, 'pursued.'\n\n[367:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1880) This is obscure. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's text is\nnis _k_ ityam. Does that mean 'which should be accurately understood?' The\nrendering in the text of Nilaka _nth_ a's reading may mean that the Brahman\nhas no such thoughts ( _k_ inta) as are referred to at Gita, [p.\n115](sbe0818.htm#page_115).\n\n[367:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1881) Does this mean the body?\n\n[367:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1882) I. e. are free from birth and death. Cf.\n\xc3\x82pastamba I, 8, 22, 4.\n\n[367:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1883) This, again, is not quite clear. Probably the\nexplanation is to be found in the passage at Gita [p.\n79](sbe0810.htm#page_79).\n\n[367:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1884) Nilaka _nth_ a's reading is 'observances or\nvows.'\n\n[367:9](sbe0858.htm#fr_1885) I. e. 'not to be acquired by inference,' Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra, [p. 35](sbe0802.htm#page_35), supra.\n\n[367:10](sbe0858.htm#fr_1886) See [p. 309](sbe0846.htm#page_309) supra; 'who\nis without symbols, and knows piety,' according to Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's\nreading.\n\n[368:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1887) See [p. 159](sbe0823.htm#page_159) supra, note\n[7](sbe0823.htm#fn_685), and cf. Manu III, 109, which is the text referred to\nin note 5 there.\n\n[368:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1888) I. e. direct perception of the Brahman. See Gita,\n[p. 57](sbe0805.htm#page_57), note  [5](sbe0805.htm#fn_181).\n\n[368:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1889) See [p. 160](sbe0823.htm#page_160) supra, note\n[8](sbe0823.htm#fn_693), and cf. also Manu II, 110.\n\n[368:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1890) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra compares Gita, [p.\n55](sbe0805.htm#page_55), about 'shaking convictions.'\n\n[368:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1891) Cf. pp.\n[159](sbe0823.htm#page_159)-[161](sbe0823.htm#page_161) supra.\n\n[368:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1892) This means, I presume, the good devoted to action\nand not to knowledge only.\n\n[368:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1893) These are the famous elements of the Sa _n_\nkhyas; see Sutra I, 61.\n\n[368:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1894) Cf. [p. 159](sbe0823.htm#page_159) and note\n[2](sbe0823.htm#fn_680).\n\n[368:9](sbe0858.htm#fr_1895) Cf. [p. 300](sbe0842.htm#page_300) supra.\n\n[368:10](sbe0858.htm#fr_1896) Cf.
