Charm with the plant agasringi to drive out Rakshas, Apsaras and\nGandharvas.\n\n1\\. With thee, O herb, the Atharvans first slew the Rakshas, with thee Kasyapa\nslew (them), with thee Kanva and Agastya (slew them).  \n2\\. With thee do we scatter the Apsaras and Gandharvas. O agasringi (odina\npinnata), goad (aga) the Rakshas, drive them all away with thy smell!  \n3\\. The Apsaras, Guggulil, I'lli, Naladi, Aukshagandhi, and Pramandani (by\nname), shall go to the river, to the ford of the waters, as if blown away!\nThither do ye, O Apsaras, pass away, (since) ye have been recognised!  \n4\\. Where grow the asvattha (ficus religiosa) and the banyan-trees, the great\ntrees with crowns, thither do ye, O Apsaras, pass away, (since) ye have been\nrecognised!  \n5\\. Where your gold and silver swings are, where cymbals and lutes chime\ntogether, thither do ye, O Apsaras, pass away, (since) ye have been recog~\nnised.  \n6\\. Hither has come the mightiest of the plants and herbs. May the agasringi\narataki pierce with her sharp horn (tikshmasringi)!  \n7\\. Of the crested Gandharva, the husband of the Apsaras, who comes dancing\nhither, I crush the two mushkas and cut off the sepas.  \n8\\. Terrible are the missiles of Indra, with a hundred points, brazen; with\nthese he shall pierce the Gandharvas, who devour oblations, and devour the\navaka-reed.  \n9\\. Terrible are the missiles of Indra, with a hundred points, golden; with\nthese he shall pierce the Gandharvas, who devour oblations, and devour the\navakd-reed.  \n10\\. All the Pisakas that devour the avaka-reeds, that burn, and spread their\nlittle light in the waters, do thou, O herb, crush and overcome!  \n11\\. One is like a dog, one like an ape. As a youth, with luxuriant locks,\npleasant to look upon, the Gandharva hangs about the woman. Him do we drive\nout from here with our powerful charm.  \n12\\. The Apsaras, you know, are your wives; ye, the Gandharvas, are their\nhusbands. Speed away, ye immortals, do not go after mortals!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 9.
