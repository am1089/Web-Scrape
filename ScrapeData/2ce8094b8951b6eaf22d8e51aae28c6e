D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n\xc2\xa7 24\\. Salvation.--I. _Upanishads._ --Release of the soul _(mukti, moksha)_ ,\nwhich falls to the lot of the elect few, consists in enlightenment, intuitive\nvision of the eternal unity of the thinker\'s Self with Brahma, to which he has\nhitherto been blind. When once this saving knowledge has been gained, the\nenlightened man is no longer under the power of "works." He has everything in\nhimself, for he is one with the All; together with the false idea of a self\ndistinct from the universal Self the forces of former works have vanished\naway; thus he has no desire and no pain, and can have none. And when his soul\nhas cast off the body, it will be reborn nevermore; it is united for ever with\nthe Absolute Brahma. See especially the fine exposition in B.A. IV. ii.-iv.;\nalso Ch. VII. xxvi. 2, Taitt. II. 9, Kena 11-12,\n\np. 51\n\n[paragraph continues] Mu\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d. II. ii. 8, III. ii. 9, and \xc5\x9aankara on Brahma-\ns\xc5\xabtra, I. i. 4, III. iv. 1 f., IV. i. 13 f.\n\nII. _Later Ved \xc4\x81nta._--\xc5\x9aankara points out that this saving intuition is\nunattainable by effort of will or thought; it arises from the power of the\ninner self, the metaphysical ego within us, which from a theistic and\ntherefore empiric standpoint may be conceived as personal God, "the Lord," or\n"qualified Brahma" (\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 12, 22). This knowledge annuls not only all sins, but\nlikewise all works, no matter whether good or bad, which have not yet begun to\nbear fruit in present experience. The works however which are the cause of the\npresent series of experience must continue in operation even after the\nattainment of enlightenment, until their power is exhausted, whereupon the\nsoul leaves the flesh for ever, as the potter\'s wheel continues to run round\nfor a while after the potter\'s hand has been removed; but this subsequent\nbodily experience no longer has any influence upon the soul. The B.A. IV. iv.\n6 teaches that, whereas on death the souls of those who have only exoteric\nknowledge or no knowledge at all go forth to continue in empiric conditions,\nthe Self of the enlightened man does not "go out" _(na utkr \xc4\x81manti)_, but\nenters into Brahma, with entire annihilation of spatial conditions; its _up\n\xc4\x81dhis_ or "determinations" wholly vanish, and it is absorbed in abstract\nentirety into the abstract Brahma (on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra III. iii. 30, IV. ii. 12\nf.). See \xc2\xa7 15.\n\np. 52\n\nThere has been much speculation upon the divisions of _karma._ A common\nclassification is that which divides it into _sanchita, pr \xc4\x81rabdha,_ and\n_kriyam \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a._ The _sanchita_ or "accumulated" _karma_ is that which was\ncreated in former births and has not yet begun to operate upon the soul. _Pr\n\xc4\x81rabdha_ or "commenced" _karma_ is that which has already begun to affect the\nsoul. _Kriyam \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a_ is "being made," that is, it is the activity of the present\nwhich will influence the soul in future births. The intellectual illumination\nof perfect "Brahma-knowledge" annuls both _sanchita_ and _kriyam \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a;_ only\nthe _pr \xc4\x81rabdha_ remains, and this exhausts itself mechanically by prolonging\nthe sage\'s physical life until all influence of _karma_ is spent, and his body\nthen dies.\n\nThe later Ved\xc4\x81nta designates by the term _j \xc4\xabvanmukti_ the condition of the\nenlightened sage previous to death, while his _pr \xc4\x81rabdha_ karma is exhausting\nitself; his subsequent condition is called _videha-mukti,_ "emancipation in\nfreedom from the body."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The After Life](brk28.htm)\n\n'
