(To salute) every day on meeting (by) an embrace of the feet, 1\n\n2\\. And (particularly) on return from a journey,\n\n3\\. (Is prescribed in the case) of parents, of their blood relations, of elder\n(brothers), of persons venerable 3\n\np. 208\n\non account, of their learning, and of the Gurus of the latter.\n\n4\\. On meeting (several persons, to whom such a salutation is due), together,\nthe most venerable (must be saluted first). 4\n\n5\\. On meeting persons who understand (the rule of returning salutes) one\nshall salute (them) pronouncing one\'s name, and (saving) \'I N. N. (ho! salute\nthee).\' 5\n\n6\\. Some (declare that) there is no restrictive rule for salutations between\nman and wife. 6\n\np. 209\n\n7\\. (The feet of) other female (relations) than the mother, a paternal uncle\'s\nwife and (elder) sisters (need) not (be embraced, nor need they be saluted)\nexcept on return from a journey. 7\n\n8\\. The feet of wives of brothers and of the mother-in-law (need) not be\nembraced (on any occasion).\n\n9\\. But (on the arrival of an) officiating priest, a father-in-law, paternal\nand maternal uncles who are younger (than oneself), one must rise; they need\nnot be saluted (as prescribed above, Sutra 5). 9\n\n10\\. In like manner (any) other aged fellow-citizen, even a _S_ udra of eighty\nyears and more, (must be honoured) by one young enough to be his son, 10\n\n11\\. (And) an \xc3\x82rya, though (he be) younger, by a _S_ udra; 11\n\n12\\. And he shall avoid (to pronounce) the name of that (person who is worthy\nof a salutation). 12\n\n13\\. And an official who (is) not (able to) recite (the Veda shall avoid to\npronounce the name) of the king.\n\np. 210\n\n14\\. A contemporary who is born on the same day (shall be addressed with the\nterms) bho _h_ or bhavan (your honour), 14\n\n15\\. (Likewise) a fellow-citizen who is ten years older (than oneself), 15\n\n16\\. (Also) an artist who is five years (older), 16\n\n17\\. And a _S_ rotriya belonging to one\'s own Vedic school who is three years\nolder, 17\n\n18\\. (Further), Brahma _n_ as destitute of learning and those who follow the\noccupations of Kshatriyas or Vai _s_ yas, 18\n\n19\\. And (a contemporary) who has performed the Diksha _n_ iyesh _t_ i of a\nSoma-sacrifice before he buys (the Soma).\n\n20\\. Wealth, relations, occupation, birth, learning, and age must be honoured;\n(but) each later named 20\n\np. 211\n\n[paragraph continues] (quality) is more important (than the preceding ones).\n\n21\\. But sacred learning is more important than all (other good qualities), 21\n\n22\\. Because that is the root of the sacred law,\n\n23\\. And because the Veda (expressly declares it). 23\n\n24\\. Way must be made for a man seated in a carriage, for one who is in his\ntenth (decade), for one requiring consideration, for a woman, for a Snataka,\nand for a king. 24\n\n25\\. But a king (must make way) for a _S_ rotriya. 25\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[207:1](sbe0270.htm#fr_977) **VI**. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 14, 7-9; I, 2, 5, 18; I,\n2, 8, 17-18.\n\n[207:3](sbe0270.htm#fr_978) \'Their blood relations, i.e. paternal and maternal\nuncles and the rest; elders, i.e. elder brothers; persons venerable on account\nof their learning, i.e. the teacher who has initiated him (a _k_ arya), the\nteacher who has instructed him (upadhyaya), and the rest.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[208:4](sbe0270.htm#fr_979) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 6, 29; 1, 2, 8, 19. \'on meeting\nhis mother and other persons whose feet must be embraced, he shall first\nembrace the highest, i.e. the most excellent, afterwards the others. Who the\nmost excellent is has been declared above, II, 50-51.\n\n[208:5](sbe0270.htm#fr_980) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 5, 12-15. Professor Stenzler reads\na _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asamavaye, while my copies and their commentary show that _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nasamavaye has to be read. Besides, it seems impossible to make any sense out\nof the former reading without assuming that the construction is strongly\nelliptical. \'On meeting, i.e. on corning together with him who knows the rule\nof returning a salute, he shall utter, i.e. loudly pronounce his name, i.e.\nthe name which he has received on the tenth day (after his birth), and which\nis to be employed in saluting, and speak the word "I" as well as the word\n"this." They declare that instead of the word "this," which here is explicitly\nprescribed, the word "I am" must be used. Some salute thus, "I Haradatta by\nname" others, "I Haradatta _s_ arman;" and the common usage is to say, "I\nHaradatta _s_ arman by name." Thus the salutation must be made. Salutation\nmeans saluting. The affix a _k_ is added to causatives and the rest. With\nreference to this matter the rule for returning salutes has been described by\nManu II, 126. . . . As (in the above Sutra) the expression "on meeting persons\nknowing" is used, those who are unacquainted with the manner of returning a\nsalute must not be saluted in this manner. How is it then to be done? It is\ndescribed by Manu III, 123.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[208:6](sbe0270.htm#fr_981) \'As Gautama says, "Some declare," the restrictive\nrule must, in his opinion, be followed.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[209:7](sbe0270.htm#fr_982) Manu II, 132; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 14, 6, 9.\n\n[209:9](sbe0270.htm#fr_983) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 14, 11.\n\n[209:10](sbe0270.htm#fr_984) \'Old (purva), i.e. of greater age. . A _S_ udra\neven, who answers this description, must be honoured by rising, not, however,\nbe saluted by one young enough to be his son, i.e. by a Brahma _n_ a who is\nvery much younger. The _S_ udra is mentioned as an instance of a man of\ninferior caste. Hence a _S_ udra must (under these circumstances) be honoured\nby rising, not be saluted by men of the three higher castes, a Vai _s_ ya by\nthose of the two higher castes, and a Kshatriya by a Brahma _n_ a.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[209:11](sbe0270.htm#fr_985) \'An \xc3\x82rya, i.e. a man of the three twice-born\ncastes, though he be inferior, i.e. younger, must be honoured by rising, not\nbe saluted by a _S_ udra. The _S_ udra is mentioned in order to give an\ninstance of (a man of) inferior caste.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[209:12](sbe0270.htm#fr_986) \'An inferior shall avoid to take his name, i.e.\nthat of a superior.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[210:14](sbe0270.htm#fr_987) Haradatta says that samanehani, \'on the same\nday,\' means \'in the same year.\' He is probably right in thinking that the\nexpression must not be interpreted too strictly. But his assertion that aha\n_h_ means also \'year\' cannot be proved by his quotation from the Nigha _n_ _t_\nuka, abde sa _m_ vatsaram ahar _g_ aram.\n\n[210:15](sbe0270.htm#fr_988) \'A person aged by ten years, i.e. at least ten\nyears older, who lives in the same town as oneself, is to be addressed as bho\n_h_ , bhavan, though he may be deficient in good qualities.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[210:16](sbe0270.htm#fr_989) \'The words "years older" must be understood. He\nwho lives by the fine arts (kala), i.e. the knowledge of music, painting leaf-\ncutting, and the like, and is at least five years older than oneself, must be\naddressed as bho _h_ or bhavan.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[210:17](sbe0270.htm#fr_990) Haradatta notes that \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 14, 13 gives\na somewhat different rule.\n\n[210:18](sbe0270.htm#fr_991) Haradatta adds that a person destitute of\nlearning, be he ever so old, may still be treated as an equal, and addressed\nas bho _h_ , bhavan, by a more learned man,\n\n[210:20](sbe0270.htm#fr_992) Manu II, 136. \'As wealth and the rest cannot be\ndirectly honoured, the persons possessing them are to be honoured . . . . .\nRespect (mana) means honour shown by saluting and the like.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[211:21](sbe0270.htm#fr_993) Manu II, 154.\n\n[211:23](sbe0270.htm#fr_994) Haradatta says that a passage to this effect\noccurs in the _Kh_ andogya-brahma _n_ a. He also refers to Manu II, 151.\n\n[211:24](sbe0270.htm#fr_995) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 11, 5, 7-9. \'A person requiring\nconsideration, i.e. one afflicted by disease. A woman, i.e. a bride or a\npregnant woman. A Snataka, i.e. a person who has bathed after completing his\nstudies and after having kept the vow of studentship.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[211:25](sbe0270.htm#fr_996) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 11, 6.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VII](sbe0271.htm)\n\n'
