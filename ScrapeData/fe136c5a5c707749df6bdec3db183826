 \nCan one of Das'aratha's seed  \nBe guilty of so vile a deed?  \nThe realm and I are Rama's: thou,  \nShouldst speak the words of justice now.  \nFor he, to claims of virtue true,  \nIs eldest born and noblest too:  \nNahush, Dilipa could not be  \nMore famous in their lives than he.  \nAs Das'aratha ruled of right,  \nSo Rama's is the power and right.  \nIf I should do this sinful deed  \nAnd forfeit hope of heavenly need,  \nMy guilty act would dim the shine  \nOf old Ikshvaku's glorious line.  \nNay, as the sin my mother wrought  \nIs grievous to my inmost thought,  \nI here, my hands together laid,  \nWill greet him in the pathless shade,  \nTo Rama shall my steps be bent,  \nMy King, of men most excellent,  \nRaghu's illustrious son, whose sway  \nMight, hell, and earth, and heaven obey.'  \n   That righteous speech, whose every word  \nBore virtue's, stamp, the audience heard;  \nOn Rama every thought was set,  \nAnd with glad tears each eye was wet.  \n'Then, if the power I still should lack  \nTo bring my noble brother back,  \nI in the wood will dwell, and share  \nHis banishment with Lakshman there.  \nBy every art persuasive I  \nTo bring him from the wood will try,  \nAnd show him to your loving eyes.  \nO Brahmans noble, good, and wise.  \nE'en now, the road to make and clear,  \nEach labourer pressed, and pioneer  \nHave I sent forward to precede  \nThe army I resolve to lead.'  \n   Thus, by fraternal love possessed,  \nHis firm resolve the prince expressed.  \nThen to Sumantra, deeply read  \nIn holy texts, he turned and said:  \n'Sumantra, rise without delay,  \nAnd as I bid my words obey.  \nGive orders for the march with speed,  \nAnd all the army hither lead.'  \n   The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,  \nObeyed the high-souled chief's behest.  \nHe hurried forth with joy inspired  \nAnd gave the orders he desired.  \nDelight each soldier's bosom filled,  \nAud through each chief and captain thrilled,  \n\np. 191  \n\nTo hear that march proclaimed, to bring  \nDear Rama back from wandering.  \nFrom house to house the tidings flew:  \nEach soldier's wife the order knew,  \nAnd as she listened blithe and gay  \nHer husband urged to speed away.  \nCaptain and soldier soon declared  \nThe host equipped and all prepared  \nWith chariots matching thought for speed,  \nAnd wagons drawn by ox and steed.  \nWhen Bharat by Vas'ishtha's side,  \nHis ready host of warriors eyed,  \nThus in Sumantra's ear he spoke.:  \n'My car and horses quickly yoke.'  \nSumantra hastened to fulfil  \nWith ready joy his master's will,  \nAnd quickly with the chariot sped  \nDrawn by fleet horses nobly bred.  \nThen glorious Bharat, true, devout,  \nWhose genuine valour none could doubt,  \nGave in fit words his order out;  \nFor he would seek the shade  \nOf the great distant wood, and there  \nWin his dear brother with his prayer:  \n'Sumantra, haste! my will declare  \n   The host be all arrayed.  \nI to the wood my way will take,  \nTo Rama supplication make,  \nAnd for the world's advantage sake,  \n   Will lead him home again.'  \nThen, ordered thus, the charioteer  \nWho listened with delighted ear,  \nWent forth and gave his orders clear  \n   To captains of the train.  \nHe gave the popular chiefs the word,  \nAnd with the news his friends he stirred,  \nAnd not a single man deferred  \n   Preparing for the road.  \nThen Brahman, Warrior, Merchant, thrall,  \nObedient to Sumantra's call,  \nEach in his house arose, and all  \nYoked elephant or camel tall,  \nOr ass or noble steed in stall,  \n   And full appointed showed.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[190:1](ry159.htm#fr_358) Not Bharat's uncle, but some councillor.\n\n[190:2](ry159.htm#fr_359) _S'atakratu_ , Lord of a hundred sacrifices, the\nperformance of a hundred _As'vamedhas_ or sacrifices of a horse entitling the\nsacrificer to this exalted dignity.\n\n[190:3](ry160.htm#fr_360) The modern Malabar.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXXIII.: The Journey Begun.](ry161.htm)\n\n"
