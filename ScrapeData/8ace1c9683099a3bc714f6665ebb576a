When the Kurus had been destroyed by (hail) stones 1, Ushasti _K_ akraya\n_n_ a lived as a beggar with his virgin 2 wife at Ibhyagrama.\n\n2\\. Seeing a chief eating beans, he begged of him. The chief said: 'I have no\nmore, except those which are put away for me here.'\n\n3\\. Ushasti said: 'Give me to eat of them.' He gave him the beans, and said:\n'There is something to drink also! Then said Ushasti: 'If I drank of it, I\nshould have drunk what was left by another, and is therefore unclean.'\n\n4\\. The chief said: 'Were not those beans also left over and therefore\nunclean?'\n\n'No,' he replied; 'for I should not have lived, if I had not eaten them, but\nthe drinking of water would be mere pleasure 3.'\n\n5\\. Having eaten himself, Ushasti gave the remaining beans to his wife. But\nshe, having eaten before, took them and put them away.\n\n6\\. Rising the next morning, Ushasti said to her: 'Alas, if we could only get\nsome food, we might gain a little wealth. The king here is going to offer a\nsacrifice, he should choose me for all the priestly offices.'\n\np. 19\n\n7\\. His wife said to him: 'Look, here are those beans of yours.' Having eaten\nthem, he went to the sacrifice which was being performed.\n\n8\\. He went and sat down on the orchestra near the Udgat _ri_ s, who were\ngoing to sing their hymns of praise. And he said to the Prastot _ri_ (the\nleader):\n\n9\\. 'Prastot _ri_ , if you, without knowing 1 the deity which belongs to the\nprastava (the hymns &c. of the Prastot _ri_ ), are going to sing it, your head\nwill fall off.'\n\n10\\. In the same manner he addressed the Udgat _ri_ : 'Udgat _ri_ , if you,\nwithout knowing the deity which belongs to the udgitha (the hymns of the Udgat\n_ri_ ), are going to sing it, your head will fall off.'\n\n11\\. In the same manner he addressed the Pratihart _ri_ : 'Pratihart _ri_ , if\nyou, without knowing the deity which belongs to the pratihara (the hymns of\nthe Pratihart _ri_ ), are going to sing it, your head will fall off.'\n\nThey stopped, and sat down in silence.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[18:1](sbe01031.htm#fr_109) When they had been killed either by stone weapons,\nor by a shower of stones, which produced a famine in the land.

Another commentator says, G _ri_ had bahirgantumarha anupa _g_\natapayodhara.\n\n[18:3](sbe01031.htm#fr_111) Or, according to the commentator, 'water I can get\nwhenever I like.'\n\n[19:1](sbe01031.htm#fr_112) The commentator is at great pains to show that a\npriest may officiate without knowing the secret meanings here assigned to\ncertain parts of the sacrifice, and without running any risk of punishment.\nOnly, if another priest is present, who is initiated, then the uninitiated,\ntaking his place, is in danger of losing his head.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 11](sbe01032.htm)\n\n"
