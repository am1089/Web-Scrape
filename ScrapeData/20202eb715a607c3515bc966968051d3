I have therefore tried to collect as much\ninformation as I could about this lately-deceased Indian Saint (died in 1886),\npartly from his own devoted disciples, partly from Indian newspapers,\njournals, and books in which the principal events of his life were chronicled,\nand his moral and religious teaching described and discussed, whether in a\nfriendly or unfriendly spirit.\n\nWhatever may be said about the aberrations of the Indian ascetics to whom\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a belonged,\n\np. vi\n\nthere are certainly some of them who deserve our interest, nay even our\nwarmest sympathy. The tortures which some of them, who hardly deserve to be\ncalled Sa _m_ nyasins, for they are not much better than jugglers or Ha _th_\nayogins, inflict on themselves, the ascetic methods by which they try to\nsubdue and annihilate their passions, and bring themselves to a state of\nextreme nervous exaltation accompanied by trances or fainting fits of long\nduration, are well known to all who have lived in India and have become\nacquainted there not only with Rajahs and Maharajahs, but with all the various\nelements that constitute the complicated system of Indian society. Though some\nof the stories told of these martyrs of the flesh and of the spirit may be\nexaggerated, enough remains of real facts to rouse at all events our\ncuriosity. When some of the true Sa _m_ nyasins, however, devote their\nthoughts and meditations to philosophical and religious problems, their\nutterances, which sway large multitudes that gather round them in their own\ncountry, cannot fail to engage our attention and sympathy, particularly if, as\nin the case of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, their doctrines are being spread by\nzealous advocates not only in India, but in America also, nay even in England.\n\nWe need not fear that the Sa _m_ nyasins of India will ever find followers or\nimitators in Europe, nor would it be at all desirable that they should, not\neven for\n\np. vii\n\nthe sake of Psychic Research, or for experiments in Physico-psychological\nLaboratories. But apart from that, a better knowledge of the teachings of one\nof them seems certainly desirable, whether for the statesmen who have to deal\nwith the various classes of Indian society, or for the missionaries who are\nanxious to understand and to influence the inhabitants of that country, or\nlastly for the students of philosophy and religion who ought to know how the\nmost ancient philosophy of the world, the Vedanta, is taught at the present\nday by the Bhaktas, that is the friends and devoted lovers of God,' and\ncontinues to exercise its powerful influence, not only on a few philosophers,\nbut on the large masses of what has always been called a country of\nphilosophers. A country permeated by such thoughts as were uttered by Ramak\n_ri_ sh _n_ a cannot possibly be looked upon as a country of ignorant\nidolaters to be converted by the same methods which are applicable to the\nraces of Central Africa.\n\nAs the Vedanta forms the background of the sayings of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, I\nthought it useful to add a short sketch of some of the most characteristic\ndoctrines of that philosophy. Without it, many readers would hardly be able to\nunderstand the ideals of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a and his disciples.\n\nI am quite aware that some of his sayings may sound strange to our ears, nay\neven offensive. Thus the conception of the Deity as the Divine Mother is apt\nto\n\np. viii\n\nstartle us, but we can understand what Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a really meant by it,\nwhen we read his saying (No. 89):\n\n'Why does the God-lover find such pleasure in addressing the Deity as Mother?\nBecause the child is more free with its mother, and consequently she is dearer\nto the child than any one else.'\n\nSometimes the language which these Hindu devotees use of the Deity must appear\nto us too familiar, nay even irreverent. They themselves seem to be aware of\nthis and say in excuse:\n\n'A true devotee who has drunk deep of Divine Love is like a veritable\ndrunkard, and, as such, cannot always observe the rules of propriety' (104).\n\nOr again:\n\n'What is the strength of a devotee? He is a child of God, and tears are his\ngreatest strength' (92).\n\nUnless we remember that harem means originally no more than a sacred and\nguarded place, the following saying will certainly jar on our ears:\n\n'The Knowledge of God may be likened to a man, while the Love of God is like a\nwoman. Knowledge has entry only up to the outer rooms of God, but no one can\nenter into the inner mysteries of God save a lover, for a woman has access\neven into the harem of the Almighty' (172).\n\nHow deep Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a has seen into the mysteries of knowledge and love\nof God, we see from the next saying:\n\np. ix\n\n'Knowledge and love of God are ultimately one and the same. There is no\ndifference between pure knowledge and pure love.'\n\nThe following utterances also show the exalted nature of his faith:\n\n'Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he who yearns for God, finds Him' (159).\n\n'He who has faith has all, and he who wants faith wants all' (201).\n\n'So long as one does not become simple like a child, one does not get Divine\nillumination. Forget all the worldly knowledge that thou hast acquired, and\nbecome as ignorant about it as a child, and then thou wilt get the knowledge\nof the True' (241).\n\n'Where does the strength of an aspirant lie? It is in his tears. As a mother\ngives her consent to fulfil the desire of her importunately weeping child, so\nGod vouchsafes to His weeping son whatever he is crying for' (306).\n\n'As a lamp does not burn without oil, so a man cannot live without God' (288).\n\n'God is in all men, but all men are not in God: that is the reason why they\nsuffer' (215).\n\nFrom such sayings we learn that though the real presence of the Divine in\nnature and in the human soul was nowhere felt so strongly and so universally\nas in India, and though the fervent love of God, nay the sense of complete\nabsorption in the Godhead, has nowhere found a stronger and more eloquent\nexpression than in the utterances of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, yet\n\np. x\n\nhe perfectly knew the barriers that separate divine and human nature.\n\nIf we remember that these utterances of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a reveal to us not\nonly his own thoughts, but the faith and hope of millions of human beings, we\nmay indeed feel hopeful about the future of that country. The consciousness of\nthe Divine in man is there, and is shared by all, even by those who seem to\nworship idols. This constant sense of the presence of God is indeed the common\nground on which we may hope that in time not too distant the great temple of\nthe future will be erected, in which Hindus and non-Hindus may join hands and\nhearts in worshipping the same Supreme Spirit--who is not far from every one\nof us, for in Him we live and move and have our being.\n\nF.M.M.\n\nIGHTHAM MOTE,  \n    _Oct. 18_ , 1898.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Contents](rls02.htm)\n\n"
