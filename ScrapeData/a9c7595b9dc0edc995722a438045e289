Verily Dadhyak \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a proclaimed this honey (the madhu-vidya) to\nthe two A _s_ vins, and a _Ri_ shi, seeing this, said (Rv.

Verily Dadhyak \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a 3 proclaimed this honey to the two A _s_\nvins, and a _Ri_ shi, seeing this, said (Rv.

Verily Dadhyak \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a proclaimed this honey to the two A _s_ vins,\nand a _Ri_ shi, seeing this, said:\n\n'He (the Lord) made bodies with two feet, he made bodies with four feet.\nHaving first become a bird, he entered the bodies as purusha (as the person).'\nThis very purusha is in all bodies the puri _s_ aya, i.e. he who lies in the\nbody (and is therefore called purusha). There is nothing that is not covered\nby him, nothing that is not filled by him.\n\n19\\. Verily Dadhya _k_ \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a proclaimed this honey to the two A _s_\nvins, and a _Ri_ shi, seeing this, said (Rv. VI, 47, 18):\n\n'He (the Lord) became like unto every form 2, and this is meant to reveal the\n(true) form of him (the \xc3\x82tman). Indra (the Lord) appears multiform through the\nMayas (appearances), for his horses (senses) are yoked, hundreds and ten.'\n\nThis (\xc3\x82tman) is the horses, this (\xc3\x82tman) is the ten, and the thousands, many\nand endless. This is the Brahman, without cause and without effect, without\nanything inside or outside; this Self is Brahman, omnipresent and omniscient.\nThis is the teaching (of the Upanishads).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[113:1](sbe15061.htm#fr_368) Instead of the last line, B. adds (IV, 5, 15):\nThat Self is to be described by No, no! He is incomprehensible, for be cannot\nbe comprehended; he is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached,\nfor he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not\nfail. How, O beloved, should he know the Knower? Thus, O Maitreyi, thou hast\nbeen instructed. Thus far goes immortality.' Having said so, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya went away (into the forest). 15. See also _Kh_ and. Up. VII, 24, 1.\n\n[113:2](sbe15062.htm#fr_369) Madhyandina text, p. 1064.\n\n[113:3](sbe15062.htm#fr_370) Madhu, honey, seems to be taken here as an\ninstance of something which is both cause and effect, or rather of things\nwhich are mutually dependent on each other, or cannot exist without one other.\nAs the bees make the honey, and the honey makes or supports the bees, bees and\nhoney are both cause and effect, or at all events are mutually dependent on\none other. In the same way the earth and all living beings are looked upon as\nmutually dependent, living beings presupposing the earth, and the earth\npresupposing living beings. This at all events seems to be the general idea of\nwhat is called the Madhuvidya, the science of honey, which Dadhya _k_\ncommunicated to the A _s_ vins.\n\n[115:1](sbe15062.htm#fr_371) Stanayitnu, thunder, is explained by the\ncommentator as Par _g_ anya.\n\n[115:2](sbe15062.htm#fr_372) Satyam, the true, the real, not, as it is\ngenerally translated, the truth.\n\n[116:1](sbe15062.htm#fr_373) The translation here follows the commentary.\n\n[116:2](sbe15062.htm#fr_374) Tanyatu, here explained as Par _g_ anya.\n\n[116:3](sbe15062.htm#fr_375) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara distinguishes here between Atharva _n_\na and \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a, if the text is correct.\n\n[117:1](sbe15062.htm#fr_376) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains Tvasht _ri_ as the sun, and\nthe sun as the head of the sacrifice which, having been cut off, was to be\nreplaced by the pravargya rite. The knowledge of this rite forms the honey of\nTvasht _ri_. The other honey which is to be kept secret is the knowledge of\nthe Self, as taught before in the Madhu-brahma _n_ a.\n\n[117:2](sbe15062.htm#fr_377) He assumed all forms, and such forms, as two-\nfooted or four-footed animals, remained permanent.
