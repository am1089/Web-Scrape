Breath said: 'What shall be my food?' They answered: 'Whatever there is,\neven unto dogs and birds.' Therefore this is food for Ana (the breather). His\nname is clearly Ana 3. To him who knows this there is nothing that is not\n(proper) food.\n\n2\\. He said: 'What shall be my dress?' They answered: 'Water.' Therefore wise\npeople, when they are going to eat food, surround their food before and after\nwith water 4.' He (pra _n_ a) thus gains a dress, and is no longer naked 5'.\n\np. 75\n\n3\\. Satyakama _G_ abala, after he had communicated this to Go _s_ ruti\nVaiyaghrapadya, said to him: 'If you were to tell this to a dry stick,\nbranches would grow, and leaves spring from it.'\n\n________________\n\n4\\. If 1 a man wishes to reach greatness, let him perform the Diksha 2\n(preparatory rite) on the day of the new moon, and then, on the night of the\nfull moon, let him stir a mash of all kinds of herbs with curds and honey, and\nlet him pour ghee on the fire (avasathya laukika), saying; 'Svaha to the\noldest and the best.' After that let him throw all that remains (of the ghee)\n3 into the mash.\n\n5\\. In the same manner let him pour ghee on. the fire, saying, 'Svaha to the\nrichest.' After that let him throw all that remains together into the mash.\n\nIn the same manner let him pour ghee on the fire, saying, 'Svaha to the firm\nrest.' After that let him throw all that remains together into the mash.\n\nIn the same manner let him pour ghee on the fire, saying, 'Svaha to success.'\nAfter that let him throw all that remains together into the mash.\n\n6\\. Then going forward and placing the mash\n\np. 76\n\nin his hands, he recites: 'Thou (Pra _n_ a) art Ama 1 by name, for all this\ntogether exists in thee. He is the oldest and best, the king, the sovereign\nMay he make me the oldest, the best, the king, the sovereign. May I be all\nthis.'\n\n7\\. Then he eats with the following _Ri_ _k_ verse at every foot: 'We choose\nthat food'--here he swallows--'Of the divine Savit _ri_ (pra _n_ a)'--here he\nswallows--'The best and all-supporting food'--here he swallows--'We meditate\non the speed of Bhaga (Savit _ri_ , pra _n_ a)'--here he drinks all.\n\n8\\. Having cleansed the vessel, whether it be a ka _m_ sa or a _k_ amasa, he\nsits down behind the fire on a skin or on the bare ground, without speaking or\nmaking any other effort. If in his dream he sees a woman, let him know this to\nbe a sign that his sacrifice has succeeded.\n\n9\\. On this there is a _S_ loka: 'If during sacrifices which are to fulfil\ncertain wishes he sees in his dreams a woman, let him know success from this\nvision in a dream, yea, from this vision in a dream.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[74:1](sbe01095.htm#fr_229) Pa _d_ vi _s_ a, fetter, \xcf\x80\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xb4\xce\xb7, pedica, a word now\nwell known, but which Burnouf (Commentaire sur le Ya\xc3\xa7na, Notes, CLXXIV) tried\nin vain to decipher.\n\n[74:2](sbe01095.htm#fr_230) Burnouf rightly preferred pratish _th_ asi to\npratish _th_ o 'si, though the commentary on the corresponding passage of the\nB _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka seems to favour tatpratish _th_ o 'si.\n\n[74:3](sbe01096.htm#fr_231) Ana, breather, more general than pra-ana = pra _n_\na, forth-breather, and the other more specified names of breath.\n\n[74:4](sbe01096.htm#fr_232) They rinse the mouth before and after every meal.\n\n[74:5](sbe01096.htm#fr_233) We expect, 'He who knows this' instead of pra _n_\na, but as p. 75 pra _n_ a may apply to every individual pra _n_ a, the usual\nfinishing sentence was possibly dropt on purpose.\n\n[75:1](sbe01096.htm#fr_234) The oblation here described is called mantha, a\nmortar, or what is pounded in a mortar, i. e. barley stirred in some kind of\ngravy. See _G_ aim. N. M. V. P. 406.\n\n[75:2](sbe01096.htm#fr_235) Not the real diksha, which is a preparatory rite\nfor great sacrifices, but penance, truthfulness, abstinence, which take the\nplace of diksha with those who live in the forest and devote themselves to\nupasana, meditative worship.\n\n[75:3](sbe01096.htm#fr_236) What is here called sampatam avanayati is the same\nas sa _m_ sravam avanayati in the B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. VI, 3, 2. The commentator\nsays: Sruvavalepanam a _g_ yam mantham sa _m_ sravayati.\n\n[76:1](sbe01096.htm#fr_237) Cf. B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. I, 1, 3, 22.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 3](sbe01097.htm)\n\n"
