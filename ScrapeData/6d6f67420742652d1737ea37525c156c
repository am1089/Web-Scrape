IX.\n\nDescendants of Raji, son of \xc3\x81yus: Indra resigns his throne to him: claimed\nafter his death by his sons, who apostatize from the religion of the Vedas,\nand are destroyed by Indra. Descendants of Pratikshatra, son of\nKshatravriddha.\n\nRAJI had five hundred sons, all of unequalled daring and vigour. Upon the\noccurrence of a war between the demons and the gods, both parties inquired of\nBrahma which would be victorious. The deity replied, "That for which Raji\nshall take up arms." Accordingly the Daityas immediately repaired to Raji, to\nsecure his alliance; which he promised them, if they would make him their\nIndra after defeating the gods. To this they answered and said, "We cannot\nprofess one thing, and mean another; our Indra is Prahlada, and it is for him\nthat we wage war." Having thus spoken, they departed; and the gods then came\nto him on the like errand. He proposed to them the said conditions, and they\nagreed that he should be their Indra. Raji therefore joined the heavenly host,\nand by his numerous and formidable weapons destroyed the army of their\nenemies.\n\nWhen the demons were discomfited, Indra placed the feet of Raji upon his head,\nand said, "Thou hast preserved me from a great danger, and I acknowledge thee\nas my father; thou art the sovereign chief over all the regions, and I, the\nIndra of the three spheres, am thy son." The Raja. smiled, and said, "Even be\nit so. The regard that is conciliated by many agreeable speeches is not to be\nresisted even when such language proceeds from a foe (much less should the\nkind words of a friend fail to win our affection)." He accordingly returned to\nhis own city, and Indra remained as his deputy in the government of heaven.\n\nWhen Raji ascended to the skies, his sons, at the instigation of Narada,\ndemanded the rank of Indra as their hereditary right; and as the deity refused\nto acknowledge their supremacy, they reduced him to submission by force, and\nusurped his station. After some considerable time had elapsed, the god of a\nhundred sacrifices, Indra, deprived of his share of offerings to the\nimmortals, met with Vrihaspati in a retired\n\np. 412\n\nplace, and said to him, "Cannot you give me a little of the sacrificial\nbutter, even if it were no bigger than a jujube, for I am in want of\nsustenance?" "If," replied Vrihaspati, "I had been applied to by you before, I\ncould have done any thing for you that you wished; as it is, I will endeavour\nand restore you in a few days to your sovereignty." So saying, he commenced a\nsacrifice for the purpose of increasing the might of Indra, and of leading the\nsons of Raji into error, and so effecting their downfall 1. Misled by their\nmental fascination, the princes became enemies of the Brahmans, regardless of\ntheir duties, and contemners of the precepts of the Vedas; and thus devoid of\nmorality and religion, they were slain by Indra, who by the assistance of the\npriest of the gods resumed his place in heaven. Whoever hears this story shall\nretain for ever his proper place, and shall never be guilty of wicked acts.\n\nRambha, the third son of \xc3\x81yus, had no progeny 2. Kshatravriddha had a son\nnamed Pratikshatra 3; his son was Sanjaya; his son was Vijaya 4; his son was\nYajnakrit 5; his son was Harshavarddhana 6; his son was Sahadeva; his son was\nAdina 7; his son was Jayasena; his son was Sankriti; his son was\nKshatradharman 8. These were the descendants of Kshatravriddha. I will now\nmention those of Nahusha.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[412:1](vp102.htm#fr_1086) The Matsya says he taught the sons of Raji the\nJinadharma or Jain religion.\n\n[412:2](vp102.htm#fr_1087) The Bhagavata enumerates however, as his\ndescendants, Rabhasa, Gambhira, and Akriya, whose posterity became Brahmans.\nThe same authority gives as the descendants of Anenas, the fourth son of \xc3\x81yus,\n\xc5\x9auddha, \xc5\x9auchi, Trikakud, and \xc5\x9aantakhya.\n\n[412:3](vp102.htm#fr_1088) The Vayu agrees with our text in making Pratipaksha\n(Pratikshatra) the son of Kshattravriddha; but the Brahma P. and Hari V.\nconsider Anenas to be the head of this branch of the posterity of \xc3\x81yus. The\nBhagavata substitutes Ku\xc5\x9ba, the Le\xc5\x9ba, of our text, the grandson of\nKshatravriddha, for the first name; and this seems most likely to be correct.\nAlthough the different MSS. agree in reading ### it should be perhaps ### the\npatronymic Kshatravriddha; making then, as the Bhagavata does, Pratikshatra\nthe son of the son of Kshatravriddha.\n\n[412:4](vp102.htm#fr_1089) Jaya: Bhagavata, Vayu.\n\n[412:5](vp102.htm#fr_1090) Vijaya: Vayu. Krita: Bhagavata,\n\n[412:6](vp102.htm#fr_1091) Harya\xc5\x9bwa: Brahma, Hari V. Haryavana: Bhagavata.\n\n[412:7](vp102.htm#fr_1092) The last of the list: Vayu. Ahina: Bhagavata.\n\n[412:8](vp102.htm#fr_1093) Kshatravriddha: Brahma, Hari V.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter X](vp103.htm)\n\n'
