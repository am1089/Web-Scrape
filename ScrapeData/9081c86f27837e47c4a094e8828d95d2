Finally, that by aid of the lessons\ninculcated in the following pages, man will pass happily through this world\ninto the state of absorption, where fables will be no longer required.\n\nHe then teaches us how Vikramaditya the Brave became King of Ujjayani.\n\nSome nineteen centuries ago, the renowned city of Ujjayani witnessed the birth\nof a prince to whom was given the gigantic name Vikramaditya. Even the\nSanskrit-speaking people, who are not usually pressed for time, shortened it\nto "Vikram", and a little further West it would infallibly have been docked\ndown to "Vik".\n\nVikram was the second son of an old king Gandharba-Sena, concerning whom\nlittle favourable has reached posterity, except that he became an ass, married\nfour queens, and had by them six sons, each of whom was more learned and\npowerful than the other. It so happened that in course of time the father\ndied. Thereupon his eldest heir, who was known as Shank, succeeded to the\ncarpet of Rajaship, and was instantly murdered by Vikram, his "scorpion", the\nhero of the following pages.[15]\n\nBy this act of vigour and manly decision, which all younger- brother princes\nshould devoutly imitate, Vikram having obtained the title of Bir, or the\nBrave, made himself Raja. He began to rule well, and the gods so favoured him\nthat day by day his dominions increased. At length he became lord of all\nIndia, and having firmly established his government, he instituted an era--an\nuncommon feat for a mere monarch, especially when hereditary.\n\nThe steps,[16] says the historian, which he took to arrive at that pinnacle of\ngrandeur, were these:\n\nThe old King calling his two grandsons Bhartari-hari and Vikramaditya, gave\nthem good counsel respecting their future learning. They were told to master\neverything, a certain way not to succeed in anything. They were diligently to\nlearn grammar, the Scriptures, and all the religious sciences. They were to\nbecome familiar with military tactics, international law, and music, the\nriding of horses and elephants--especially the latter--the driving of\nchariots, and the use of the broadsword, the bow, and the mogdars or Indian\nclubs. They were ordered to be skilful in all kinds of games, in leaping and\nrunning, in besieging forts, in forming and breaking bodies of troops; they\nwere to endeavour to excel in every princely quality, to be cunning in\nascertaining the power of an enemy, how to make war, to perform journeys, to\nsit in the presence of the nobles, to separate the different sides of a\nquestion, to form alliances, to distinguish between the innocent and the\nguilty, to assign proper punishments to the wicked, to exercise authority with\nperfect justice, and to be liberal. The boys were then sent to school, and\nwere placed under the care of excellent teachers, where they became truly\nfamous. Whilst under pupilage, the eldest was allowed all the power necessary\nto obtain a knowledge of royal affairs, and he was not invested with the regal\noffice till in these preparatory steps he had given full satisfaction to his\nsubjects, who expressed high approval of his conduct.\n\nThe two brothers often conversed on the duties of kings, when the great\nVikramaditya gave the great Bhartari-hari the following valuable advice[17]:\n\n"As Indra, during the four rainy months, fills the earth with water, so a king\nshould replenish his treasury with money. As Surya the sun, in warming the\nearth eight months, does not scorch it, so a king, in drawing revenues from\nhis people, ought not to oppress them. As Vayu, the wind, surrounds and fills\neverything, so the king by his officers and spies should become acquainted\nwith the affairs and circumstances of his whole people. As Yama judges men\nwithout partiality or prejudice, and punishes the guilty, so should a king\nchastise, without favour, all offenders. As Varuna, the regent of water, binds\nwith his pasha or divine noose his enemies, so let a king bind every\nmalefactor safely in prison. As Chandra,[18] the moon, by his cheering light\ngives pleasure to all, thus should a king, by gifts and generosity, make his\npeople happy. And as Prithwi, the earth, sustains all alike, so should a king\nfeel an equal affection and forbearance towards every one."\n\nBecome a monarch, Vikram meditated deeply upon what is said of monarchs:--"A\nking is fire and air; he is both sun and moon; he is the god of criminal\njustice; he is the genius of wealth; he is the regent of water; he is the lord\nof the firmament; he is a powerful divinity who appears in human shape." He\nreflected with some satisfaction that the scriptures had made him absolute,\nhad left the lives and properties of all his subjects to his arbitrary will,\nhad pronounced him to be an incarnate deity, and had threatened to punish with\ndeath even ideas derogatory to his honour.\n\nHe punctually observed all the ordinances laid down by the author of the Niti,\nor institutes of government. His night and day were divided into sixteen\npahars or portions, each one hour and a half, and they were disposed of as\nfollows:--\n\nBefore dawn Vikram was awakened by a servant appointed to this special duty.\nHe swallowed--a thing allowed only to a khshatriya or warrior--Mithridatic\nevery morning on the saliva[19], and he made the cooks taste every dish before\nhe ate of it. As soon as he had risen, the pages in waiting repeated his\nsplendid qualities, and as he left his sleeping-room in full dress, several\nBrahmans rehearsed the praises of the gods. Presently he bathed, worshipped\nhis guardian deity, again heard hymns, drank a little water, and saw alms\ndistributed to the poor. He ended this watch by auditing his accounts.\n\nNext entering his court, he placed himself amidst the assembly. He was always\narmed when he received strangers, and he caused even women to be searched for\nconcealed weapons. He was surrounded by so many spies and so artful, that of a\nthousand, no two ever told the same tale. At the levee, on his right sat his\nrelations, the Brahmans, and men of distinguished birth. The other castes were\non the left, and close to him stood the ministers and those whom he delighted\nto consult. Afar in front gathered the bards chanting the praises of the gods\nand of the king; also the charioteers, elephanteers, horsemen, and soldiers of\nvalour. Amongst the learned men in those assemblies there were ever some who\nwere well instructed in all the scriptures, and others who had studied in one\nparticular school of philosophy, and were acquainted only with the works on\ndivine wisdom, or with those on justice, civil and criminal, on the arts,\nmineralogy or the practice of physic; also persons cunning in all kinds of\ncustoms; riding-masters, dancing- masters, teachers of good behaviour,\nexaminers, tasters, mimics, mountebanks, and others, who all attended the\ncourt and awaited the king\'s commands. He here pronounced judgment in suits of\nappeal. His poets wrote about him:\n\nThe lord of lone splendour an instant suspends His course at mid~noon, ere he\nwestward descends; And brief are the moments our young monarch knows, Devoted\nto pleasure or paid to repose!\n\nBefore the second sandhya,[20] or noon, about the beginning of the third\nwatch, he recited the names of the gods, bathed, and broke his fast in his\nprivate room; then rising from food, he was amused by singers and dancing\ngirls. The labours of the day now became lighter. After eating he retired,\nrepeating the name of his guardian deity, visited the temples, saluted the\ngods conversed with the priests, and proceeded to receive and to distribute\npresents. Fifthly, he discussed political questions with his ministers and\ncouncillors.\n\nOn the announcement of the herald that it was the sixth watch--about 2 or 3\nP.M.--Vikram allowed himself to follow his own inclinations, to regulate his\nfamily, and to transact business of a private and personal nature.\n\nAfter gaining strength by rest, he proceeded to review his troops, examining\nthe men, saluting the officers, and holding military councils. At sunset he\nbathed a third time and performed the five sacraments of listening to a\nprelection of the Veda; making oblations to the manes; sacrificing to Fire in\nhonour of the deities; giving rice to dumb creatures; and receiving guests\nwith due ceremonies. He spent the evening amidst a select company of wise,\nlearned, and pious men, conversing on different subjects, and reviewing the\nbusiness of the day.\n\nThe night was distributed with equal care. During the first portion Vikram\nreceived the reports which his spies and envoys, dressed in every disguise,\nbrought to him about his enemies. Against the latter he ceased not to use the\nfive arts, namely--dividing the kingdom, bribes, mischief-making,\nnegotiations, and brute-force--especially preferring the first two and the\nlast. His forethought and prudence taught him to regard all his nearest\nneighbours and their allies as hostile. The powers beyond those natural\nenemies he considered friendly because they were the foes of his foes. And all\nthe remoter nations he looked upon as neutrals, in a transitional or\nprovisional state as it were, till they became either his neighbours\'\nneighbours, or his own neighbours, that is to say, his friends or his foes.\n\nThis important duty finished he supped, and at the end of the third watch he\nretired to sleep, which was not allowed to last beyond three hours. In the\nsixth watch he arose and purified himself. The seventh was devoted to holding\nprivate consultations with his ministers, and to furnishing the officers of\ngovernment with requisite instructions. The eighth or last watch was spent\nwith the Purohita or priest, and with Brahmans, hailing the dawn with its\nappropriate rites; he then bathed, made the customary offerings, and prayed in\nsome unfrequented place near pure water.\n\nAnd throughout these occupations he bore in mind the duty of kings, namely--to\npursue every object till it be accomplished; to succour all dependents, and\nhospitably to receive guests, however numerous. He was generous to his\nsubjects respecting taxes, and kind of speech; yet he was inexorable as death\nin the punishment of offenses. He rarely hunted, and he visited his pleasure\ngardens only on stated days. He acted in his own dominions with justice; he\nchastised foreign foes with rigour; he behaved generously to Brahmans, and he\navoided favouritism amongst his friends. In war he never slew a suppliant, a\nspectator, a person asleep or undressed, or anyone that showed fear. Whatever\ncountry he conquered, offerings were presented to its gods, and effects and\nmoney were given to the reverends. But what benefited him most was his\nattention to the creature comforts of the nine Gems of Science: those eminent\nmen ate and drank themselves into fits of enthusiasm, and ended by\nimmortalizing their patron\'s name.\n\nBecome Vikram the Great he established his court at a delightful and beautiful\nlocation rich in the best of water. The country was difficult of access, and\nartificially made incapable of supporting a host of invaders, but four great\nroads met near the city. The capital was surrounded with durable ramparts,\nhaving gates of defence, and near it was a mountain fortress, under the\nespecial charge of a great captain.\n\nThe metropolis was well garrisoned and provisioned, and it surrounded the\nroyal palace, a noble building without as well as within. Grandeur seemed\nembodied there, and Prosperity had made it her own. The nearer ground, viewed\nfrom the terraces and pleasure pavilions, was a lovely mingling of rock and\nmountain, plain and valley, field and fallow, crystal lake and glittering\nstream. The banks of the winding Lavana were fringed with meads whose herbage,\npearly with morning dew, afforded choicest grazing for the sacred cow, and\nwere dotted with perfumed clumps of Bo-trees, tamarinds, and holy figs: in one\nplace Vikram planted 100,000 in a single orchard and gave them to his\nspiritual advisers. The river valley separated the stream from a belt of\nforest growth which extended to a hill range, dark with impervious jungle, and\ncleared here and there for the cultivator\'s village. Behind it, rose another\nsub-range, wooded with a lower bush and already blue with air, whilst in the\nbackground towered range upon range, here rising abruptly into points and\npeaks, there ramp-shaped or wall- formed, with sheer descents, and all of\nlight azure hue adorned with glories of silver and gold.\n\nAfter reigning for some years, Vikram the Brave found himself at the age of\nthirty, a staid and sober middle-aged man, He had several sons--daughters are\nnaught in India--by his several wives, and he had some paternal affection for\nnearly all--except of course, for his eldest son, a youth who seemed to\nconduct himself as though he had a claim to the succession. In fact, the king\nseemed to have taken up his abode for life at Ujjayani, when suddenly he\nbethought himself, "I must visit those countries of whose names I am ever\nhearing." The fact is, he had determined to spy out in disguise the lands of\nall his foes, and to find the best means of bringing against them his\nformidable army.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nWe now learn how Bhartari Raja becomes Regent of Ujjayani.\n\nHaving thus resolved, Vikram the Brave gave the government into the charge of\na younger brother, Bhartari Raja, and in the garb of a religious mendicant,\naccompanied by Dharma Dhwaj, his second son, a youth bordering on the age of\npuberty, he began to travel from city to city, and from forest to forest.\n\nThe Regent was of a settled melancholic turn of mind, having lost in early\nyouth a very peculiar wife. One day, whilst out hunting, he happened to pass a\nfuneral pyre, upon which a Brahman\'s widow had just become Sati (a holy woman)\nwith the greatest fortitude. On his return home he related the adventure to\nSita Rani, his spouse, and she at once made reply that virtuous women die with\ntheir husbands, killed by the fire of grief, not by the flames of the pile. To\nprove her truth the prince, after an affectionate farewell, rode forth to the\nchase, and presently sent back the suite with his robes torn and stained, to\nreport his accidental death. Sita perished upon the spot, and the widower\nremained inconsolable--for a time.\n\nHe led the dullest of lives, and took to himself sundry spouses, all equally\ndistinguished for birth, beauty, and modesty. Like his brother, he performed\nall the proper devoirs of a Raja, rising before the day to finish his\nablutions, to worship the gods, and to do due obeisance to the Brahmans. He\nthen ascended the throne, to judge his people according to the Shastra,\ncarefully keeping in subjection lust, anger, avarice, folly, drunkenness, and\npride; preserving himself from being seduced by the love of gaming and of the\nchase; restraining his desire for dancing, singing, and playing on musical\ninstruments, and refraining from sleep during daytime, from wine, from\nmolesting men of worth, from dice, from putting human beings to death by\nartful means, from useless travelling, and from holding any one guilty without\nthe commission of a crime. His levees were in a hall decently splendid, and he\nwas distinguished only by an umbrella of peacock\'s feathers; he received all\ncomplainants, petitioners, and presenters of offenses with kind looks and soft\nwords. He united to himself the seven or eight wise councillors, and the sober\nand virtuous secretary that formed the high cabinet of his royal brother, and\nthey met in some secret lonely spot, as a mountain, a terrace, a bower or a\nforest, whence women, parrots, and other talkative birds were carefully\nexcluded.\n\nAnd at the end of this useful and somewhat laborious day, he retired to his\nprivate apartments, and, after listening to spiritual songs and to soft music,\nhe fell asleep. Sometimes he would summon his brother\'s "Nine Gems of\nScience," and give ear to their learned discourses. But it was observed that\nthe viceroy reserved this exercise for nights when he was troubled with\ninsomnia--the words of wisdom being to him an infallible remedy for that\ndisorder.\n\nThus passed onwards his youth, doing nothing that it could desire, forbidden\nall pleasures because they were unprincely, and working in the palace harder\nthan in the pauper\'s hut. Having, however, fortunately for himself, few\npredilections and no imagination, he began to pride himself upon being a\nphilosopher. Much business from an early age had dulled his wits, which were\nnever of the most brilliant; and in the steadily increasing torpidity of his\nspirit, he traced the germs of that quietude which forms the highest happiness\nof man in this storm of matter called the world. He therefore allowed himself\nbut one friend of his soul. He retained, I have said, his brother\'s seven or\neight ministers; he was constant in attendance upon the Brahman priests who\nofficiated at the palace, and who kept the impious from touching sacred\nproperty; and he was courteous to the commander-in-chief who directed his\nwarriors, to the officers of justice who inflicted punishment upon offenders,\nand to the lords of towns, varying in number from one to a thousand. But he\nplaced an intimate of his own in the high position of confidential councillor,\nthe ambassador to regulate war and peace.\n\nMahi-pala was a person of noble birth, endowed with shining abilities,\npopular, dexterous in business, acquainted with foreign parts, famed for\neloquence and intrepidity, and as Menu the Lawgiver advises, remarkably\nhandsome.\n\nBhartari Raja, as I have said, became a quietist and a philosopher. But\nKama,[21] the bright god who exerts his sway over the three worlds, heaven and\nearth and grewsome Hades,[22] had marked out the prince once more as the\nvictim of his blossom- tipped shafts and his flowery bow. How, indeed, could\nhe hope to escape the doom which has fallen equally upon Brahma the Creator,\nVishnu the Preserver, and dreadful Shiva the Three-eyed Destroyer[23]?\n\nBy reason of her exceeding beauty, her face was a full moon shining in the\nclearest sky; her hair was the purple cloud of autumn when, gravid with rain,\nit hangs low over earth; and her complexion mocked the pale waxen hue of the\nlarge-flowered jasmine. Her eyes were those of the timid antelope; her lips\nwere as red as those of the pomegranate\'s bud, and when they opened, from them\ndistilled a fountain of ambrosia. Her neck was like a pigeon\'s; her hand the\npink lining of the conch-shell; her waist a leopard\'s; her feet the softest\nlotuses. In a word, a model of grace and loveliness was Dangalah Rani, Raja\nBhartari\'s last and youngest wife.\n\nThe warrior laid down his arms before her; the politician spoke out every\nsecret in her presence. The religious prince would have slaughtered a cow--\nthat sole unforgivable sin--to save one of her eyelashes: the absolute king\nwould not drink a cup of water without her permission; the staid philosopher,\nthe sober quietist, to win from her the shadow of a smile, would have danced\nbefore her like a singing-girl. So desperately enamoured became Bhartari Raja.\n\nIt is written, however, that love, alas! breeds not love; and so it happened\nto the Regent. The warmth of his affection, instead of animating his wife,\nannoyed her; his protestations wearied her; his vows gave her the headache;\nand his caresses were a colic that made her blood run cold. Of course, the\nprince perceived nothing, being lost in wonder and admiration of the beauty\'s\ncoyness and coquetry. And as women must give away their hearts, whether asked\nor not, so the lovely Dangalah Rani lost no time in lavishing all the passion\nof her idle soul upon Mahi-pala, the handsome ambassador of peace and war. By\nthis means the three were happy and were contented; their felicity, however,\nbeing built on a rotten foundation, could not long endure. It soon ended in\nthe following extraordinary way.\n\nIn the city of Ujjayani,[24] within sight of the palace, dwelt a Brahman and\nhis wife, who, being old and poor, and having nothing else to do, had applied\nthemselves to the practice of austere devotion.[25] They fasted and refrained\nfrom drink, they stood on their heads and held their arms for weeks in the\nair; they prayed till their knees were like pads; they disciplined themselves\nwith scourges of wire; and they walked about unclad in the cold season, and in\nsummer they sat within a circle of flaming wood, till they became the envy and\nadmiration of all the plebeian gods that inhabit the lower heavens. In fine,\nas a reward for their exceeding piety, the venerable pair received at the\nhands of a celestial messenger an apple of the tree Kalpavriksha--a fruit\nwhich has the virtue of conferring eternal life upon him that tastes it.\n\nScarcely had the god disappeared, when the Brahman, opening his toothless\nmouth, prepared to eat the fruit of immortality. Then his wife addressed him\nin these words, shedding copious tears the while:\n\n"To die, O man, is a passing pain; to be poor is an interminable anguish.\nSurely our present lot is the penalty of some great crime committed by us in a\npast state of being.[26] Callest thou this state life? Better we die at once,\nand so escape the woes of the world!"\n\nHearing these words, the Brahman sat undecided, with open jaws and eyes fixed\nupon the apple. Presently he found tongue: "I have accepted the fruit, and\nhave brought it here; but having heard thy speech, my intellect hath wasted\naway; now I will do whatever thou pointest out."\n\nThe wife resumed her discourse, which had been interrupted by a more than\nusually copious flow of tears. "Moreover, O husband, we are old, and what are\nthe enjoyments of the stricken in years? Truly quoth the poet--\n\nDie loved in youth, not hated in age.\n\nIf that fruit could have restored thy dimmed eyes, and deaf ears, and blunted\ntaste, and warmth of love, I had not spoken to thee thus."\n\nAfter which the Brahman threw away the apple, to the great joy of his wife,\nwho felt a natural indignation at the prospect of seeing her goodman become\nimmortal, whilst she still remained subject to the laws of death; but she\nconcealed this motive in the depths of her thought, enlarging, as women are\napt to do, upon everything but the truth. And she spoke with such success,\nthat the priest was about to toss in his rage the heavenly fruit into the\nfire, reproaching the gods as if by sending it they had done him an injury.\nThen the wife snatched it out of his hand, and telling him it was too precious\nto be wasted, bade him arise and gird his loins and wend him to the Regent\'s\npalace, and offer him the fruit--as King Vikram was absent--with a right\nreverend brahmanical benediction. She concluded with impressing upon her\nunworldly husband the necessity of requiring a large sum of money as a return\nfor his inestimable gift. "By this means, "she said, "thou mayst promote thy\npresent and future welfare.[27]"\n\nThen the Brahman went forth, and standing in the presence of the Raja, told\nhim all things touching the fruit, concluding with "O, mighty prince!\nvouchsafe to accept this tribute, and bestow wealth upon me. I shall be happy\nin your living long!"\n\nBhartari Raja led the supplicant into an inner strongroom, where stood heaps\nof the finest gold-dust, and bade him carry away all that he could; this the\npriest did, not forgetting to fill even his eloquent and toothless mouth with\nthe precious metal. Having dismissed the devotee groaning under the burden,\nthe Regent entered the apartments of his wives, and having summoned the\nbeautiful Queen Dangalah Rani, gave her the fruit, and said, "Eat this, light\nof my eyes! This fruit--joy of my heart!--will make thee everlastingly young\nand beautiful."\n\nThe pretty queen, placing both hands upon her husband\'s bosom, kissed his eyes\nand lips, and sweetly smiling on his face--for great is the guile of women--\nwhispered, "Eat it thyself, dear one, or at least share it with me; for what\nis life and what is youth without the presence of those we love?" But the\nRaja, whose heart was melted by these unusual words, put her away tenderly,\nand, having explained that the fruit would serve for only one person,\ndeparted.\n\nWhereupon the pretty queen, sweetly smiling as before, slipped the precious\npresent into her pocket. When the Regent was transacting business in the hall\nof audience she sent for the ambassador who regulated war and peace, and\npresented him with the apple in a manner at least as tender as that with which\nit had been offered to her.\n\nThen the ambassador, after slipping the fruit into his pocket also, retired\nfrom the presence of the pretty queen, and meeting Lakha, one of the maids of\nhonour, explained to her its wonderful power, and gave it to her as a token of\nhis love. But the maid of honour, being an ambitious girl, determined that the\nfruit was a fit present to set before the Regent in the absence of the King.\nBhartari Raja accepted it, bestowed on her great wealth, and dismissed her\nwith many thanks.\n\nHe then took up the apple and looked at it with eyes brimful of tears, for he\nknew the whole extent of his misfortune. His heart ached, he felt a loathing\nfor the world, and he said with sighs and groans[28]:\n\n"Of what value are these delusions of wealth and affection, whose sweetness\nendures for a moment and becomes eternal bitterness? Love is like the\ndrunkard\'s cup: delicious is the first drink, palling are the draughts that\nsucceed it, and most distasteful are the dregs. What is life but a restless\nvision of imaginary pleasures and of real pains, from which the only waking is\nthe terrible day of death? The affection of this world is of no use, since, in\nconsequence of it, we fall at last into hell. For which reason it is best to\npractice the austerities of religion, that the Deity may bestow upon us\nhereafter that happiness which he refuses to us here!"\n\nThus did Bhartari Raja determine to abandon the world. But before setting out\nfor the forest, he could not refrain from seeing the queen once more, so hot\nwas the flame which Kama had kindled in his heart. He therefore went to the\napartments of his women, and having caused Dangalah Rani to be summoned, he\nasked her what had become of the fruit which he had given to her. She answered\nthat, according to his command, she had eaten it. Upon which the Regent showed\nher the apple, and she beholding it stood aghast, unable to make any reply.\nThe Raja gave careful orders for her beheading; he then went out, and having\nhad the fruit washed, ate it. He quitted the throne to be a jogi, or religious\nmendicant, and without communicating with any one departed into the jungle.\nThere he became such a devotee that death had no power over him, and he is\nwandering still. But some say that he was duly absorbed into the essence of\nthe Deity.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nWe are next told how the valiant Vikram returned to his own country.\n\nThus Vikram\'s throne remained empty. When the news reached King Indra, Regent\nof the Lower Firmament and Protector of Earthly Monarchs, he sent Prithwi\nPala, a fierce giant,[29] to defend the city of Ujjayani till such time as its\nlawful master might reappear, and the guardian used to keep watch and ward\nnight and day over his trust.\n\nIn less than a year the valorous Raja Vikram became thoroughly tired of\nwandering about the woods half dressed: now suffering from famine, then\nexposed to the attacks of wild beasts, and at all times very ill at ease. He\nreflected also that he was not doing his duty to his wives and children; that\nthe heir-apparent would probably make the worst use of the parental absence;\nand finally, that his subjects, deprived of his fatherly care, had been left\nin the hands of a man who, for ought he could say, was not worthy of the high\ntrust. He had also spied out all the weak points of friend and foe. Whilst\nthese and other equally weighty considerations were hanging about the Raja\'s\nmind, he heard a rumour of the state of things spread abroad; that Bhartari,\nthe regent, having abdicated his throne, had gone away into the forest. Then\nquoth Vikram to his son,"We have ended our wayfarings, now let us turn our\nsteps homewards!"\n\nThe gong was striking the mysterious hour of midnight as the king and the\nyoung prince approached the principal gate. And they were pushing through it\nwhen a monstrous figure rose up before them and called out with a fearful\nvoice, "Who are ye, and where are ye going ? Stand and deliver your names!"\n\n"I am Raja Vikram," rejoined the king, half choked with rage, "and I am come\nto mine own city. Who art thou that darest to stop or stay me?"\n\n"That question is easily answered," cried Prithwi Pala the giant, in his\nroaring voice; "the gods have sent me to protect Ujjayani. If thou be really\nRaja Vikram, prove thyself a man: first fight with me, and then return to\nthine own."\n\nThe warrior king cried "Sadhu!" wanting nothing better. He girt his girdle\ntight round his loins, summoned his opponent into the empty space beyond the\ngate, told him to stand on guard, and presently began to devise some means of\nclosing with or running in upon him. The giant\'s fists were large as\nwatermelons, and his knotted arms whistled through the air like falling trees,\nthreatening fatal blows. Besides which the Raja\'s head scarcely reached the\ngiant\'s stomach, and the latter, each time he struck out, whooped so\nabominably loud, that no human nerves could remain unshaken.\n\nAt last Vikram\'s good luck prevailed. The giant\'s left foot slipped, and the\nhero, seizing his antagonist\'s other leg, began to trip him up. At the same\nmoment the young prince, hastening to his parent\'s assistance, jumped\nviciously upon the enemy\'s naked toes. By their united exertions they brought\nhim to the ground, when the son sat down upon his stomach, making himself as\nweighty as he well could, whilst the father, climbing up to the monster\'s\nthroat, placed himself astride upon it, and pressing both thumbs upon his\neyes, threatened to blind him if he would not yield.\n\nThen the giant, modifying the bellow of his voice, cried out--\n\n"O Raja, thou hast overthrown me, and I grant thee thy life."\n\n"Surely thou art mad, monster," replied the king, in jeering tone, half\nlaughing, half angry. "To whom grantest thou life? If I desire it I can kill\nthee; how, then, cost thou talk about granting me my life?"\n\n"Vikram of Ujjayani," said the giant, "be not too proud! I will save thee from\na nearly impending death. Only hearken to the tale which I have to tell thee,\nand use thy judgment, and act upon it. So shalt thou rule the world free from\ncare, and live without danger, and die happily."\n\n"Proceed," quoth the Raja, after a moment\'s thought, dismounting from the\ngiant\'s throat, and beginning to listen with all his ears.\n\nThe giant raised himself from the ground, and when in a sitting posture, began\nin solemn tones to speak as follows:\n\n"In short, the history of the matter is, that three men were born in this same\ncity of Ujjayani, in the same lunar mansion, in the same division of the great\ncircle described upon the ecliptic, and in the same period of time. You, the\nfirst, were born in the house of a king. The second was an oilman\'s son, who\nwas slain by the third, a jogi, or anchorite, who kills all he can, wafting\nthe sweet scent of human sacrifice to the nostrils of Durga, goddess of\ndestruction. Moreover, the holy man, after compassing the death of the\noilman\'s son, has suspended him head downwards from a mimosa tree in a\ncemetery. He is now anxiously plotting thy destruction. He hath murdered his\nown child--"\n\n"And how came an anchorite to have a child?" asked Raja Vikram, incredulously.\n\n"That is what I am about to tell thee," replied the giant. "In the good days\nof thy generous father, Gandharba-Sena, as the court was taking its pleasure\nin the forest, they saw a devotee, or rather a devotee\'s head, protruding from\na hole in the ground. The white ants had surrounded his body with a case of\nearth, and had made their home upon his skin. All kinds of insects and small\nanimals crawled up and down the face, yet not a muscle moved. Wasps had hung\ntheir nests to its temples, and scorpions wandered in and out of the matted\nand clotted hair; yet the hermit felt them not. He spoke to no one; he\nreceived no gifts; and had it not been for the opening of his nostrils, as he\ncontinually inhaled the pungent smoke of a thorn fire, man would have deemed\nhim dead. Such were his religious austerities.\n\n"Thy father marvelled much at the sight, and rode home in profound thought.\nThat evening, as he sat in the hall of audience, he could speak of nothing but\nthe devotee; and his curiosity soon rose to such a pitch, that he proclaimed\nabout the city a reward of one hundred gold pieces to any one that could bring\nto court this anchorite of his own free will.\n\n"Shortly afterwards, Vasantasena, a singing and dancing girl more celebrated\nfor wit and beauty than for sagesse or discretion, appeared before thy sire,\nand offered for the petty inducement of a gold bangle to bring the anchorite\ninto the palace, carrying a baby on his shoulder.\n\n"The king hearing her speak was astonished, gave her a betel leaf in token\nthat he held her to her promise, and permitted her to depart, which she did\nwith a laugh of triumph.\n\n"Vasantasena went directly to the jungle, where she found the pious man faint\nwith thirst, shriveled with hunger, and half dead with heat and cold. She\ncautiously put out the fire. Then, having prepared a confection, she\napproached from behind and rubbed upon his lips a little of the sweetmeat,\nwhich he licked up with great relish. Thereupon she made more and gave it to\nhim. After two days of this generous diet he gained some strength, and on the\nthird, as he felt a finger upon his mouth, he opened his eyes and said, "Why\nhast thou come here?"\n\n"The girl, who had her story in readiness, replied: "I am the daughter of a\ndeity, and have practiced religious observances in the heavenly regions. I\nhave now come into this forest!" And the devotee, who began to think how much\nmore pleasant is such society than solitude, asked her where her hut was, and\nrequested to be led there.\n\n"Then Vasantasena, having unearthed the holy man and compelled him to purify\nhimself, led him to the abode which she had caused to be built for herself in\nthe wood. She explained its luxuries by the nature of her vow, which bound her\nto indulge in costly apparel, in food with six flavours, and in every kind of\nindulgence.[30] In course of time the hermit learned to follow her example; he\ngave up inhaling smoke, and he began to eat and drink as a daily occupation.\n\n"At length Kama began to trouble him. Briefly the saint and saintess were made\nman and wife, by the simple form of matrimony called the Gandharba-vivaha,[31]\nand about ten months afterwards a son was born to them. Thus the anchorite\ncame to have a child.\n\n"Remained Vasantasena\'s last feat. Some months passed: then she said to the\ndevotee her husband, \'Oh saint! let us now, having finished our devotions,\nperform a pilgrimage to some sacred place, that all the sins of our bodies may\nbe washed away, after which we will die and depart into everlasting\nhappiness.\' Cajoled by these speeches, the hermit mounted his child upon his\nshoulder and followed her where she went--directly into Raja Gandharba-Sena\'s\npalace.\n\n"When the king and the ministers and the officers and the courtiers saw\nVasantasena, and her spouse carrying the baby, they recognized her from afar.\nThe Raja exclaimed, \'Lo! this is the very singing girl who went forth to bring\nback the devotee. \'And all replied: \'O great monarch! thou speakest truly;\nthis is the very same woman. And be pleased to observe that whatever things\nshe, having asked leave to undertake, went forth to do, all these she hath\ndone!\' Then gathering around her they asked her all manner of questions, as if\nthe whole matter had been the lightest and the most laughable thing in the\nworld.\n\n"But the anchorite, having heard the speeches of the king and his courtiers,\nthought to himself, \'They have done this for the purpose of taking away the\nfruits of my penance.\' Cursing them all with terrible curses, and taking up\nhis child, he left the hall. Thence he went to the forest, slaughtered the\ninnocent, and began to practice austerities with a view to revenge that hour,\nand having slain his child, he will attempt thy life. His prayers have been\nheard. In the first place they deprived thee of thy father. Secondly, they\ncast enmity between thee and thy brother, thus dooming him to an untimely end.\nThirdly, they are now working thy ruin. The anchorite\'s design is to offer up\na king and a king\'s son to his patroness Durga, and by virtue of such\ndevotional act he will obtain the sovereignty of the whole world!\n\n"But I have promised, O Vikram, to save thee, if such be the will of Fortune,\nfrom impending destruction. Therefore hearken well unto my words. Distrust\nthem that dwell amongst the dead, and remember that it is lawful and right to\nstrike off his head that would slay thee. So shalt thou rule the universal\nearth, and leave behind thee an immortal name!"\n\nSuddenly Prithwi Pala, the giant, ceased speaking, and disappeared. Vikram and\nhis son then passed through the city gates, feeling their limbs to be certain\nthat no bones were broken, and thinking over the scene that had occurred.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nWe now are informed how the valiant King Vikram met with the Vampire.\n\nIt was the spring season when the Raja returned, and the Holi festival[32]\ncaused dancing and singing in every house. Ujjayani was extraordinarily happy\nand joyful at the return of her ruler, who joined in her gladness with all his\nkingly heart. The faces and dresses of the public were red and yellow with\ngulal and abir,--perfumed powders,[33]--which were sprinkled upon one another\nin token of merriment. Musicians deafened the citizens\' ears, dancing girls\nperformed till ready to faint with fatigue, the manufacturers of comfits made\ntheir fortunes, and the Nine Gems of Science celebrated the auspicious day\nwith the most long- winded odes. The royal hero, decked in regal attire, and\nattended by many thousands of state palanquins glittering with their various\nornaments, and escorted by a suite of a hundred kingly personages, with their\nmartial array of the four hosts, of cavalry, elephants, chariots, and\ninfantry, and accompanied by Amazon girls, lovely as the suite of the gods,\nhimself a personification of majesty, bearing the white parasol of dominion,\nwith a golden staff and tassels, began once more to reign.\n\nAfter the first pleasures of return, the king applied himself unremittingly to\ngood government and to eradicating the abuses which had crept into the\nadministration during the period of his wanderings. Mindful of the wise\nsaying, "if the Rajadid not punish the guilty, the stronger would roast the\nweaker like a fish on the spit," he began the work of reform with an iron\nhand. He confiscated the property of a councillor who had the reputation of\ntaking bribes; he branded the forehead of a sudra or servile man whose breath\nsmelt of ardent spirits, and a goldsmith having been detected in fraud he\nordered him to be cut in shreds with razors as the law in its mercy directs.\nIn the case of a notorious evil-speaker he opened the back of his head and had\nhis tongue drawn through the wound. A few murderers he burned alive on iron\nbeds, praying the while that Vishnu might have mercy upon their souls. His\nspies were ordered, as the shastra called "The Prince" advises, to mix with\nrobbers and thieves with a view of leading them into situations where they\nmight most easily be entrapped, and once or twice when the fellows were too\nwary, he seized them and their relations and impaled them all, thereby\nconclusively proving, without any mistake, that he was king of earth.\n\nWith the sex feminine he was equally severe. A woman convicted of having\npoisoned an elderly husband in order to marry a younger man was thrown to the\ndogs, which speedily devoured her. He punished simple infidelity by cutting\noff the offender\'s nose--an admirable practice, which is not only a severe\npenalty to the culprit, but also a standing warning to others, and an\nefficient preventative to any recurrence of the fault. Faithlessness combined\nwith bad example or brazen-facedness was further treated by being led in\nsolemn procession through the bazar mounted on a diminutive and crop-eared\ndonkey, with the face turned towards the crupper. After a few such examples\nthe women of Ujjayani became almost modest; it is the fault of man when they\nare not tolerably well behaved in one point at least.\n\nEvery day as Vikram sat upon the judgment-seat, trying causes and punishing\noffenses, he narrowly observed the speech, the gestures, and the countenances\nof the various criminals and litigants and their witnesses. Ever suspecting\nwomen, as I have said, and holding them to be the root of all evil, he never\nfailed when some sin or crime more horrible than usual came before him, to ask\nthe accused, "Who is she?" and the suddenness of the question often elicited\nthe truth by accident. For there can be nothing thoroughly and entirely bad\nunless a woman is at the bottom of it; and, knowing this, Raja Vikram made\ncertain notable hits under the most improbable circumstances, which had almost\ngiven him a reputation for omniscience. But this is easily explained: a man\nintent upon squaring the circle will see squares in circles wherever he looks,\nand sometimes he will find them.\n\nIn disputed cases of money claims, the king adhered strictly to established\npractice, and consulted persons learned in the law. He seldom decided a cause\non his own judgment, and he showed great temper and patience in bearing with\nrough language from irritated plaintiffs and defendants, from the infirm, and\nfrom old men beyond eighty. That humble petitioners might not be baulked in\nhaving access to the "fountain of justice," he caused an iron box to be\nsuspended by a chain from the windows of his sleeping apartment. Every morning\nhe ordered the box to be opened before him, and listened to all the placets at\nfull length. Even in this simple process he displayed abundant cautiousness.\nFor, having forgotten what little of the humanities he had mastered in his\nyouth, he would hand the paper to a secretary whose business it was to read it\nout before him; after which operation the man of letters was sent into an\ninner room, and the petition was placed in the hands of a second scribe. Once\nit so happened by the bungling of the deceitful kayasths(clerks) that an\nimportant difference was found to occur in the same sheet. So upon strict\ninquiry one secretary lost his ears and the other his right hand. After this\npetitions were rarely if ever falsified.\n\nThe Raja Vikram also lost no time in attacking the cities and towns and\nvillages of his enemies, but the people rose to a man against him, and hewing\nhis army to pieces with their weapons, vanquished him. This took place so\noften that he despaired of bringing all the earth under the shadow of his\numbrella.\n\nAt length on one occasion when near a village he listened to a conversation of\nthe inhabitants. A woman having baked some cakes was giving them to her child,\nwho leaving the edges would eat only the middle. On his asking for another\ncake, she cried, "This boy\'s way is like Vikram\'s in his attempt to conquer\nthe world!" On his inquiring "Mother, why, what am I doing; and what has\nVikram done?" "Thou, my boy," she replied, "throwing away the outside of the\ncake eatest the middle only. Vikram also in his ambition, without subduing the\nfrontiers before attacking the towns, invades the heart of the country and\nlays it waste. On that account, both the townspeople and others rising, close\nupon him from the frontiers to the centre, and destroy his army. That is his\nfolly."\n\nVikram took notice of the woman\'s words. He strengthened his army and resumed\nhis attack on the provinces and cities, beginning with the frontiers, reducing\nthe outer towns and stationing troops in the intervals. Thus he proceeded\nregularly with his invasions. After a respite, adopting the same system and\nmarshalling huge armies, he reduced in regular course each kingdom and\nprovince till he became monarch of the whole world.\n\nIt so happened that one day as Vikram the Brave sat upon the judgment-seat, a\nyoung merchant, by name Mal Deo, who had lately arrived at Ujjayani with\nloaded camels and elephants, and with the reputation of immense wealth,\nentered the palace court. Having been received with extreme condescension, he\ngave into the king\'s hand a fruit which he had brought in his own, and then\nspreading a prayer carpet on the floor he sat down. Presently, after a quarter\nof an hour, he arose and went away. When he had gone the king reflected in his\nmind: "Under this disguise, perhaps, is the very man of whom the giant spoke."\nSuspecting this, he did not eat the fruit, but calling the master of the\nhousehold he gave the present to him, ordering him to keep it in a very\ncareful manner. The young merchant, however, continued every day to court the\nhonour of an interview, each time presenting a similar gift.\n\nBy chance one morning Raja Vikram went, attended by his ministers, to see his\nstables. At this time the young merchant also arrived there, and in the usual\nmanner placed a fruit in the royal hand. As the king was thoughtfully tossing\nit in the air, it accidentally fell from his fingers to the ground. Then the\nmonkey, who was tethered amongst the horses to draw calamities from their\nheads,[34] snatched it up and tore it to pieces. Whereupon a ruby of such size\nand water came forth that the king and his ministers, beholding its\nbrilliancy, gave vent to expressions of wonder.\n\nQuoth Vikram to the young merchant severely--for his suspicions were now\nthoroughly roused--"Why hast thou given to us all this wealth?"\n\n"O great king," replied Mal Deo, demurely, "it is written in the scriptures\n(shastra) \'Of Ceremony\' that \'we must not go empty- handed into the presence\nof the following persons, namely, Rajas, spiritual teachers, judges, young\nmaidens, and old women whose daughters we would marry.\' But why, O Vikram,\ncost thou speak of one ruby only, since in each of the fruits which I have\nlaid at thy feet there is a similar jewel?" Having heard this speech, the king\nsaid to the master of his household, "Bring all the fruits which I have\nentrusted to thee." The treasurer, on receiving the royal command, immediately\nbrought them, and having split them, there was found in each one a ruby, one\nand all equally perfect in size and water. Raja Vibram beholding such\ntreasures was excessively pleased. Having sent for a lapidary, he ordered him\nto examine the rubies, saying, "We cannot take anything with us out of this\nworld. Virtue is a noble quality to possess here below--so tell justly what is\nthe value of each of these gems.[35]"\n\nTo so moral a speech the lapidary replied, " Maha-Raja[36]! thou hast said\ntruly; whoever possesses virtue, possesses everything; virtue indeed\naccompanies us always, and is of advantage in both worlds. Hear, O great king!\neach gem is perfect in colour, quality and beauty. If I were to say that the\nvalue of each was ten million millions of suvarnas (gold pieces), even then\nthou couldst not understand its real worth. In fact, each ruby would buy one\nof the seven regions into which the earth is divided."\n\nThe king on hearing this was delighted, although his suspicions were not\nsatisfied; and, having bestowed a robe of honour upon the lapidary, dismissed\nhim. Thereon, taking the young merchant\'s hand, he led him into the palace,\nseated him upon his own carpet in presence of the court, and began to say, "My\nentire kingdom is not worth one of these rubies: tell me how it is that thou\nwho buyest and sellest hast given me such and so many pearls?"\n\nMal Deo replied: "O great king, the speaking of matters like the following in\npublic is not right; these things--prayers, spells, drugs, good qualities,\nhousehold affairs, the eating of forbidden food, and the evil we may have\nheard of our neighbour--should not be discussed in full assembly. Privately I\nwill disclose to thee my wishes. This is the way of the world; when an affair\ncomes to six ears, it does not remain secret; if a matter is confided to four\nears it may escape further hearing; and if to two ears even Brahma the Creator\ndoes not know it; how then can any rumour of it come to man?"\n\nHaving heard this speech, Raja Vikram took Mal Deo aside, and began to ask\nhim, saying, "O generous man! you have given me so many rubies, and even for a\nsingle day you have not eaten food with me; I am exceedingly ashamed, tell me\nwhat you desire."\n\n"Raja," said the young merchant, "I am not Mal Deo, but Shanta- Shil,[37] a\ndevotee. I am about to perform spells, incantations and magical rites on the\nbanks of the river Godavari, in a large smashana, a cemetery where bodies are\nburned. By this means the Eight Powers of Nature will all become mine. This\nthing I ask of you as alms, that you and the young prince Dharma Dhwaj will\npass one night with me, doing my bidding. By you remaining near me my\nincantations will be successful."\n\nThe valiant Vikram nearly started from his seat at the word cemetery, but,\nlike a ruler of men, he restrained his face from expressing his feelings, and\nhe presently replied, "Good, we will come, tell us on what day!"\n\n"You are to come to me," said the devotee, "armed, but without followers, on\nthe Monday evening the 14th of the dark half of the month Bhadra.[38]" The\nRaja said: "Do you go your ways, we will certainly come." In this manner,\nhaving received a promise from the king, and having taken leave, the devotee\nreturned to his house: thence he repaired to the temple, and having made\npreparations, and taken all the necessary things, he went back into the\ncemetery and sat down to his ceremonies.\n\nThe valiant Vikram, on the other hand, retired into an inner apartment, to\nconsult his own judgment about an adventure with which, for fear of ridicule,\nhe was unwilling to acquaint even the most trustworthy of his ministers.\n\nIn due time came the evening moon\'s day, the 14th of the dark half of the\nmonth Bhadra. As the short twilight fell gloomily on earth, the warrior king\naccompanied by his son, with turband-ends tied under their chins, and with\ntrusty blades tucked under their arms ready for foes, human, bestial, or\ndevilish, slipped out unseen through the palace wicket, and took the road\nleading to the cemetery on the river bank.\n\nDark and drear was the night. Urged by the furious blast of the lingering\nwinter-rains, masses of bistre-coloured cloud, like the forms of unwieldy\nbeasts, rolled heavily over the firmament plain. Whenever the crescent of the\nyoung moon, rising from an horizon sable as the sad Tamala\'s hue,[39] glanced\nupon the wayfarers, it was no brighter than the fine tip of an elephant\'s tusk\nprotruding from the muddy wave. A heavy storm was impending; big drops fell in\nshowers from the forest trees as they groaned under the blast, and beneath the\ngloomy avenue the clayey ground gleamed ghastly white. As the Raja and his son\nadvanced, a faint ray of light, like the line of pure gold streaking the dark\nsurface of the touchstone, caught their eyes, and directed their footsteps\ntowards the cemetery.\n\nWhen Vikram came upon the open space on the riverbank where corpses were\nburned, he hesitated for a moment to tread its impure ground. But seeing his\nson undismayed, he advanced boldly, trampling upon remnants of bones, and only\ncovering his mouth with his turband-end.\n\nPresently, at the further extremity of the smashana, or burning ground,\nappeared a group. By the lurid flames that flared and flickered round the\nhalf-extinguished funeral pyres, with remnants of their dreadful loads, Raja\nVikram and Dharma Dhwaj could note the several features of the ill-omened\nspot. There was an outer circle of hideous bestial forms; tigers were roaring,\nand elephants were trumpeting; wolves, whose foul hairy coats blazed with\nsparks of bluish phosphoric light, were devouring the remnants of human\nbodies; foxes, jackals, and hyenas were disputing over their prey; whilst\nbears were chewing the livers of children. The space within was peopled by a\nmultitude of fiends. There were the subtle bodies of men that had escaped\ntheir grosser frames prowling about the charnel ground, where their corpses\nhad been reduced to ashes, or hovering in the air, waiting till the new bodies\nwhich they were to animate were made ready for their reception. The spirits of\nthose that had been foully slain wandered about with gashed limbs; and\nskeletons, whose mouldy bones were held together by bits of blackened sinew,\nfollowed them as the murderer does his victim. Malignant witches with\nshriveled skins, horrid eyes and distorted forms, crawled and crouched over\nthe earth; whilst spectres and goblins now stood motionless, and tall as lofty\npalm trees; then, as if in fits, leaped, danced, and tumbled before their\nevocator. The air was filled with shrill and strident cries, with the fitful\nmoaning of the storm-wind, with the hooting of the owl, with the jackal\'s long\nwild cry, and with the hoarse gurgling of the swollen river, from whose banks\nthe earth-slip thundered in its fall.\n\nIn the midst of all, close to the fire which lit up his evil countenance, sat\nShanta-Shil, the jogi, with the banner that denoted his calling and his magic\nstaff planted in the ground behind him. He was clad in the ochre-coloured\nloin-wrap of his class; from his head streamed long tangled locks of hair like\nhorsehair; his black body was striped with lines of chalk, and a girdle of\nthighbones encircled his waist. His face was smeared with ashes from a funeral\npyre, and his eyes, fixed as those of a statue, gleamed from this mask with an\ninfernal light of hate. His cheeks were shaven, and he had not forgotten to\ndraw the horizontal sectarian mark. But this was of blood; and Vikram, as he\ndrew near saw that he was playing upon a human skull with two shank bones,\nmaking music for the horrid revelry.\n\nNow Raja Vibram, as has been shown by his encounter with Indra\'s watchman, was\na bold prince, and he was cautious as he was brave. The sight of a human being\nin the midst of these terrors raised his mettle; he determined to prove\nhimself a hero, and feeling that the critical moment was now come, he hoped to\nrid himself and his house forever of the family curse that hovered over them.\n\nFor a moment he thought of the giant\'s words, "And remember that it is lawful\nand right to strike off his head that would slay thee." A stroke with his good\nsword might at once and effectually put an end to the danger. But then he\nremembered that he had passed his royal word to do the devotee\'s bidding that\nnight. Besides, he felt assured that the hour for action had not yet sounded.\n\nThese reflections having passed through his mind with the rapid course of a\nstar that has lost its honours,[40] Vikram courteously saluted Shanta-Shil.\nThe jogi briefly replied, "Come sit down, both of ye." The father and son took\ntheir places, by no means surprised or frightened by the devil dances before\nand around them. Presently the valiant Raja reminded the devotee that he was\ncome to perform his promise, and lastly asked, "What commands are there for\nus?"\n\nThe jogi replied, "O king, since you have come, just perform one piece of\nbusiness. About two kos[41] hence, in a southerly direction, there is another\nplace where dead bodies are burned; and in that place is a mimosa tree, on\nwhich a body is hanging. Bring it to me immediately."\n\nRaja Vikram took his son\'s hand, unwilling to leave him in such company; and,\ncatching up a fire-brand, went rapidly away in the proper direction. He was\nnow certain that Shanta-Shil was the anchorite who, enraged by his father, had\nresolved his destruction; and his uppermost thought was a firm resolve "to\nbreakfast upon his enemy, ere his enemy could dine upon him." He muttered this\nold saying as he went, whilst the tom-toming of the anchorite upon the skull\nresounded in his ears, and the devil-crowd, which had held its peace during\nhis meeting with Shanta-Shil, broke out again in an infernal din of whoops and\nscreams, yells and laughter.\n\nThe darkness of the night was frightful, the gloom deepened till it was hardly\npossible to walk. The clouds opened their fountains, raining so that you would\nsay they could never rain again. Lightning blazed forth with more than the\nlight of day, and the roar of the thunder caused the earth to shake. Baleful\ngleams tipped the black cones of the trees and fitfully scampered like\nfireflies over the waste. Unclean goblins dogged the travellers and threw\nthemselves upon the ground in their path and obstructed them in a thousand\ndifferent ways. Huge snakes, whose mouths distilled blood and black venom,\nkept clinging around their legs in the roughest part of the road, till they\nwere persuaded to loose their hold either by the sword or by reciting a spell.\nIn fact, there were so many horrors and such a tumult and noise that even a\nbrave man would have faltered, yet the king kept on his way.\n\nAt length having passed over, somehow or other, a very difficult road, the\nRaja arrived at the smashana, or burning place pointed out by the jogi.\nSuddenly he sighted the tree where from root to top every branch and leaf was\nin a blaze of crimson flame. And when he, still dauntless, advanced towards\nit, a clamour continued to be raised, and voices kept crying, "Kill them! kill\nthem! seize them! seize them! take care that they do not get away! let them\nscorch themselves to cinders! let them suffer the pains of Patala.[42]"\n\nFar from being terrified by this state of things the valiant Raja increased in\nboldness, seeing a prospect of an end to his adventure. Approaching the tree\nhe felt that the fire did not burn him, and so he sat there for a while to\nobserve the body, which hung, head downwards, from a branch a little above\nhim.\n\nIts eyes, which were wide open, were of a greenish-brown, and never twinkled;\nits hair also was brown,[43] and brown was its face--three several shades\nwhich, notwithstanding, approached one another in an unpleasant way, as in an\nover-dried cocoa-nut. Its body was thin and ribbed like a skeleton or a bamboo\nframework, and as it held on to a bough, like a flying fox,[44] by the toe-\ntips, its drawn muscles stood out as if they were ropes of coin. Blood it\nappeared to have none, or there would have been a decided determination of\nthat curious juice to the head; and as the Raja handled its skin it felt icy\ncold and clammy as might a snake. The only sign of life was the whisking of a\nragged little tail much resembling a goat\'s.\n\nJudging from these signs the brave king at once determined the creature to be\na Baital--a Vampire. For a short time he was puzzled to reconcile the\nappearance with the words of the giant, who informed him that the anchorite\nhad hung the oilman\'s son to a tree. But soon he explained to himself the\ndifficulty, remembering the exceeding cunning of jogis and other reverend men,\nand determining that his enemy, the better to deceive him, had doubtless\naltered the shape and form of the young oilman\'s body.\n\nWith this idea, Vikram was pleased, saying, "My trouble has been productive of\nfruit." Remained the task of carrying the Vampire to Shanta-Shil the devotee.\nHaving taken his sword, the Raja fearlessly climbed the tree, and ordering his\nson to stand away from below, clutched the Vampire\'s hair with one hand, and\nwith the other struck such a blow of the sword, that the bough was cut and the\nthing fell heavily upon the ground. Immediately on falling it gnashed its\nteeth and began to utter a loud wailing cry like the screams of an infant in\npain. Vikram having heard the sound of its lamentations, was pleased, and\nbegan to say to himself, "This devil must be alive." Then nimbly sliding down\nthe trunk, he made a captive of the body, and asked " Who art thou?"\n\nScarcely, however, had the words passed the royal lips, when the Vampire\nslipped through the fingers like a worm, and uttering a loud shout of\nlaughter, rose in the air with its legs uppermost, and as before suspended\nitself by its toes to another bough. And there it swung to and fro, moved by\nthe violence of its cachinnation.\n\n"Decidedly this is the young oilman!" exclaimed the Raja, after he had stood\nfor a minute or two with mouth open, gazing upwards and wondering what he\nshould do next. Presently he directed Dharma Dhwaj not to lose an instant in\nlaying hands upon the thing when it next might touch the ground, and then he\nagain swarmed up the tree. Having reached his former position, he once more\nseized the Baital\'s hair, and with all the force of his arms--for he was\nbeginning to feel really angry--he tore it from its hold and dashed it to the\nground, saying, "O wretch, tell me who thou art?"\n\nThen, as before, the Raja slid deftly down the trunk, and hurried to the aid\nof his son, who in obedience to orders, had fixed his grasp upon the Vampire\'s\nneck. Then, too, as before, the Vampire, laughing aloud, slipped through their\nfingers and returned to its dangling-place.\n\nTo fail twice was too much for Raja Vikram\'s temper, which was right kingly\nand somewhat hot. This time he bade his son strike the Baital\'s head with his\nsword. Then, more like a wounded bear of Himalaya than a prince who had\nestablished an era, he hurried up the tree, and directed a furious blow with\nhis sabre at the Vampire\'s lean and calfless legs. The violence of the stroke\nmade its toes loose their hold of the bough, and when it touched the ground,\nDharma Dhwaj\'s blade fell heavily upon its matted brown hair. But the blows\nappeared to have lighted on iron-wood--to judge at least from the behaviour of\nthe Baital, who no sooner heard the question, "O wretch, who art thou?" than\nit returned in loud glee and merriment to its old position.\n\nFive mortal times did Raja Vikram repeat this profitless labour. But so far\nfrom losing heart, he quite entered into the spirit of the adventure. Indeed\nhe would have continued climbing up that tree and taking that corpse under his\narm--he found his sword useless--and bringing it down, and asking it who it\nwas, and seeing it slip through his fingers, six times sixty times, or till\nthe end of the fourth and present age,[45] had such extreme resolution been\nrequired.\n\nHowever, it was not necessary. On the seventh time of falling, the Baital,\ninstead of eluding its capturer\'s grasp, allowed itself to be seized, merely\nremarking that "even the gods cannot resist a thoroughly obstinate man."[46]\nAnd seeing that the stranger, for the better protection of his prize, had\nstripped off his waistcloth and was making it into a bag, the Vampire thought\nproper to seek the most favourable conditions for himself, and asked his\nconqueror who he was, and what he was about to do?\n\n"Vile wretch," replied the breathless hero, "know me to be Vikram the Great,\nRaja of Ujjayani, and I bear thee to a man who is amusing himself by drumming\nto devils on a skull."\n\n"Remember the old saying, mighty Vikram!" said the Baital, with a sneer, "that\nmany a tongue has cut many a throat. I have yielded to thy resolution and I am\nabout to accompany thee, bound to thy back like a beggar\'s wallet. But hearken\nto my words, ere we set out upon the way. I am of a loquacious disposition,\nand it is well nigh an hour\'s walk between this tree and the place where thy\nfriend sits, favouring his friends with the peculiar music which they love.\nTherefore, I shall try to distract my thoughts, which otherwise might not be\nof the most pleasing nature, by means of sprightly tales and profitable\nreflections. Sages and men of sense spend their days in the delights of light\nand heavy literature, whereas dolts and fools waste time in sleep and\nidleness. And I purpose to ask thee a number of questions, concerning which we\nwill, if it seems fit to thee, make this covenant:\n\n"Whenever thou answerest me, either compelled by Fate or entrapped by my\ncunning into so doing, or thereby gratifying thy vanity and conceit, I leave\nthee and return to my favourite place and position in the siras-tree, but when\nthou shalt remain silent, confused, and at a loss to reply, either through\nhumility or thereby confessing thine ignorance, and impotence, and want of\ncomprehension, then will I allow thee, of mine own free will, to place me\nbefore thine employer. Perhaps I should not say so; it may sound like bribing\nthee, but--take my counsel, and mortify thy pride, and assumption, and\narrogance, and haughtiness, as soon as possible. So shalt thou derive from me\na benefit which none but myself can bestow."\n\nRaja Vikram hearing these rough words, so strange to his royal ear, winced;\nthen he rejoiced that his heir apparent was not near; then he looked round at\nhis son Dharma Dhwaj, to see if he was impertinent enough to be amused by the\nBaital. But the first glance showed him the young prince busily employed in\npinching and screwing the monster\'s legs, so as to make it fit better into the\ncloth. Vikram then seized the ends of the waistcloth, twisted them into a\nconvenient form for handling, stooped, raised the bundle with a jerk, tossed\nit over his shoulder, and bidding his son not to lag behind, set off at a\nround pace towards the western end of the cemetery.\n\nThe shower had ceased, and, as they gained ground, the weather greatly\nimproved.\n\nThe Vampire asked a few indifferent questions about the wind and the rain and\nthe mud. When he received no answer, he began to feel uncomfortable, and he\nbroke out with these words: "O King Vikram, listen to the true story which I\nam about to tell thee."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vampire\'s First Story.
