On account of the acting after (i.e. the shining after), (that after\nwhich sun, moon, &c. are said to shine is the highest Self), and (because by\nthe light) of him (all this is said to be lighted).\n\nWe read (Mu. Up. II, 2, 10, and Ka. Up. V, 15), 'The sun does not shine there,\nnor the moon and the stars, nor these lightnings, much less this fire. After\nhim when he shines everything shines; by the light of him all this is\nlighted.' The question here arises whether he 'after whom when he shines\neverything shines, and by whose light all this is lighted,' is some luminous\nsubstance, or the highest Self (pra _g \xc3\xb1_a atman).\n\nA luminous substance, the purvapakshin maintains.--Why?--Because the passage\ndenies the shining only of such luminous bodies as the sun and the like. It is\nknown (from every-day experience) that luminous bodies such as the moon and\nthe stars do not shine at daytime when the sun, which is itself a luminous\nbody, is shining. Hence we infer that that thing on account of which all this,\nincluding the moon, the stars, and the sun himself, does not\n\np. 193\n\nshine is likewise a thing of light. The 'shining after' also is possible only\nif there is a luminous body already, for we know from experience that 'acting\nafter' (imitation) of any kind takes place only when there are more than one\nagent of similar nature; one man, for instance, walks after another man who\nwalks himself. Therefore we consider it settled that the passage refers to\nsome luminous body.\n\nTo this we reply that the highest Self only can be meant.--Why?--On account of\nthe acting after. The shining after mentioned in the passage, 'After him when\nhe shines everything shines,' is possible only if the pra _g \xc3\xb1_a Self, i.e.\nthe highest Self, is understood. Of that pra _g \xc3\xb1_a Self another scriptural\npassage says, 'His form is light, his thoughts are true' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14,\n2). On the other hand, it is not by any means known that the sun, &c. shines\nafter some other luminous body. Moreover, on account of the equality of nature\nof all luminous bodies such as the sun and the like, there is no need for them\nof any other luminous body after which they should shine; for we see that a\nlamp, for instance, does not 'shine after' another lamp. Nor is there any such\nabsolute rule (as the purvapakshin asserted) that acting after is observed\nonly among things of similar nature. It is rather observed among things of\ndissimilar nature also; for a red-hot iron ball acts after, i.e. burns after\nthe burning fire, and the dust of the ground blows (is blown) after the\nblowing wind.--The clause 'on account of the acting after' (which forms part\nof the Sutra) points to the shining after (mentioned in the scriptural _s_\nloka under discussion); the clause 'and of him' points to the fourth pada of\nthe same _s_ loka. The meaning of this latter clause is that the cause\nassigned for the light of the sun, &c. (in the passage 'by the light of him\neverything is lighted') intimates the pra _g \xc3\xb1_a Self. For of that Self\nScripture says, 'Him the gods worship as the light of lights, as immortal\ntime' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 16). That, on the other hand, the light of the sun,\nthe moon, &c, should shine by some other (physical) light is, in the first\nplace, not known; and, in the second place, absurd\n\np. 194\n\nas one (physical) light is counteracted by another.--Or else the cause\nassigned for the shining does not apply only to the sun and the other bodies\nmentioned in the _s_ loka; but the meaning (of the last pada) rather is--as we\nmay conclude from the comprehensive statement 'all this'--that the\nmanifestation of this entire world consisting of names and forms, acts, agents\nand fruits (of action) has for its cause the existence of the light of\nBrahman; just as the existence of the light of the sun is the cause of the\nmanifestation of all form and colour.--Moreover, the text shows by means of\nthe word 'there' ('the sun does not shine there,' &c.) that the passage is to\nbe connected with the general topic, and that topic is Brahman as appears from\nMu. Up. II, 2, 5, 'In whom the heaven, the earth, and the sky are woven,' &c.\nThe same appears from a passage subsequent (on the one just quoted and\nimmediately preceding the passage under discussion). 'In the highest golden\nsheath there is the Brahman without passion and without parts; that is pure,\nthat is the light of lights, that is it which they know who know the Self.'\nThis passage giving rise to the question, 'How is it the light of lights?'\nthere is occasion for the reply given in 'The sun does not shine there,' &c.--\nIn refutation of the assertion that the shining of luminous bodies such as the\nsun and the moon can be denied only in case of there being another luminous\nbody--as, for instance, the light of the moon and the stars is denied only\nwhen the sun is shining--we point out that it has been shown that he (the\nSelf) only can be the luminous being referred to, nothing else. And it is\nquite possible to deny the shining of sun, moon, and so on with regard to\nBrahman; for whatever is perceived is perceived by the light of Brahman only\nso that sun, moon, &c. can be said to shine in it; while Brahman as self-\nluminous is not perceived by means of any other light. Brahman manifests\neverything else, but is not manifested by anything else; according to such\nscriptural passages as, 'By the Self alone as his light man sits,' &c. (B\n_ri_. Up. IV, 3, 6), and 'He is incomprehensible, for he cannot be\ncomprehended '(B _ri_. Up. IV, 2, 4).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 23](sbe34092.htm)\n\n"
