The new (thing is enjoined); on account of the statement of what has to\nbe done.\n\nThe Sutra discusses an additional question connected with the meditation on\nbreath. Both texts--the _Kh_ andogya as well as the Va _g_ asaneyaka-declare\nthat water constitutes a dress for pra _n_ a, and refer to the rinsing of the\nmouth\n\np. 641\n\nwith water. The doubt here arises whether what the texts mean to enjoin is the\nrinsing of the mouth, or a meditation on pra _n_ a as having water for its\ndress.--The Purvapakshin maintains the former view; for, he says, the Va _g_\nasaneyaka uses the injunctive form \'he is to rinse,\' while there is no\ninjunctive form referring to the meditation; and what the text says in praise\nof the breath thus not being allowed to remain naked may be taken as a mere\nglorification of the act of rinsing. And as ordinary rinsing of the mouth,\nsubsequent to eating, is already established by Sm _ri_ ti and custom, we must\nconclude that the text means to enjoin rinsing of the mouth of a different\nkind, viz. as auxiliary to the meditation on pra _n_ a.--To this the Sutra\nreplies that what the text enjoins is the new\' thing, i.e. the previously non-\nestablished meditation on water as forming the dress of pra _n_ a. \'On account\nof the statement of what has to be done,\' i.e. on account of the statement of\nwhat is not established--for only on the latter condition Scripture has a\nmeaning. The beginning as well as the end of the Va _g_ asaneyaka-text clearly\nrefers to a meditation on the water used for rinsing as forming a dress for\npra _n_ a; and as rinsing is already established by Sm _ri_ ti and custom, we\nnaturally infer that what the text enjoins is a meditation on breath as having\nthe water used in rinsing for its dress. This also explains why the _Kh_\nandogya-text does not mention the rinsing at all, but merely the clothing of\nbreath with water.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of \'the statement of\nwhat has to be done."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
