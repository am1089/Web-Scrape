The footmen are merely\nsaid to have been 'unnumbered.'\n\n[488:2b](ry473.htm#fr_1015) I omit Cantos XCVII., XCVIII,and XCIX, which\ndescribe in the usual way three single combats between Sugriva and Angad on\nthe Vanar side and Virupaksha, Mahodar, and Mahapars'va on the side of the\ngiants. The weapons of the Vanars are trees and rocks: the giants fight with\nswords, axes, and bows and arrows. The details are generally the same as those\nof preceding duels. The giants fall, one in each Canto.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto C.: Ravan In The Field.](ry474.htm)\n\n"
