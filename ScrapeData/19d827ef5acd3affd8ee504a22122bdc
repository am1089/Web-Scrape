Then the Asuras, even through arrogance,\nthinking, 'Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?' went on offering\ninto their own mouths. They came to naught, even through arrogance: wherefore\nlet no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the cause of ruin 2.\n\n11:1:8:22\\. But the gods went on offering unto one another. Pra _g_ apati gave\nhimself up to them, and the sacrifice became theirs; for, indeed, the\nsacrifice is the food of the gods.\n\n11:1:8:33\\. Having given himself up to the gods, he created that counterpart\nof himself, to wit, the sacrifice: whence people say, 'The sacrifice is Pra\n_g_ apati;' for he created it as a counterpart of himself.\n\n11:1:8:44\\. By this (Full and New-moon) sacrifice he redeemed himself from the\ngods. Now when he (the Sacrificer) enters on the fast, he thereby gives\nhimself up to the gods, even as Pra _g_ apati thereby gave himself up to the\ngods. Let him therefore endeavour to pass that night (with his mind)\ncompletely restrained 3, in the same way as he would\n\np. 23\n\nproceed with (material for) an oblation, for he becomes an oblation to the\ngods.\n\n11:1:8:55\\. And when (on the following day) he performs the sacrifice, then he\nredeems himself by sacrifice from the gods, even as Pra _g_ apati thereby\nredeemed himself: when he takes out the material for (the chief) sacrificial\ndish, he redeems the sacrifice by the material for the sacrificial dish; the\nsacrificial dish (he redeems) by the invitatory formula, the invitatory\nformula by the portion cut (from the sacrificial dish), the portion by the\noffering-formula, the offering--formula by the Vasha _t_ -call, and the Vasha\n_t_ -call by the oblation. His oblation itself is still unredeemed,--\n\n11:1:8:66\\. And that sacrifice of his is like a tree with its top broken off.\nHe redeems the oblation by the Anvaharya (mess of rice) 1; and because he\nthereby supplies (anv-a-harati) what is wanting in the sacrifice, therefore it\nis called Anvaharya. Thus, then, that entire sacrifice of his comes to be\nredeemed; and that sacrifice becomes the Sacrificer's self in yonder world.\nAnd, verily, the Sacrificer who, knowing this, performs that (offering of)\nredemption comes into existence in yonder world with a complete body.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[22:2](sbe44010.htm#fr_120) See V, 1, 1, 1. 2.\n\n[22:3](sbe44010.htm#fr_121) Professor Delbruck, Altind.
