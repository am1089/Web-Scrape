Narada said :-- When the Devi Tulasi has been made so dear to Naraya _n_\na and thus an object for worship, then describe Her worship and Stotra (the\nhymn of Tulasi) now. O Muni! By whom was She first worshipped? By whom were\nHer glories first sung? And how did She become therefore an object of worship?\nSpeak out all these to me.\n\n\n\n3\\. Suta said :-- Hearing these words of Narada, Naraya _n_ a, laughing, began\nto describe this very holy and sin-destroying account of Tulasi.\n\n\n\n4-15. Naraya _n_ a said :-- Bhagavan Hari duly worshipped Tulasi, and began to\nenjoy her with Lak _s_ mi; He raised Tulasi to the rank of Lak _s_ mi and thus\nmade her fortunate and glorious Lak _s_ mi and Ganga allowed and bore this new\nunion of Naraya _n_ a and Tulasi. But Sarasvati could not endure this high\nposition of Tulasi owing to Her anger. She became self-conceited and beat\nTulasi on some quarrel before Hari. Tulasi became abashed and insulted and\nvanished off. Being the \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92vari of all the Siddhis, the Devi, the Self-\nmanifest and the Giver of the Siddhiyoga to the J\xc3\xb1anins, Tulasi, Oh! what a\nwonder, became angry and turned out as invisible to S\xc2\x92ri Hari even.\n\n\n\nNot seeing Tulasi, Hari appeased Sarasvati and getting Her permission went to\nthe Tulasi forest. Going there and taking a bath in due accord, and with due\nrites, worshipped with His whole heart the chaste Tulasi and then began to\nmeditate on Her with devotion. O Narada! He gets certainly all siddhis who\nworships Tulasi duly with the ten lettered mantra :-- \xc2\x93S\xc2\x92rim Hrim Klim Aim\nVrindavanyai Svaha,\xc2\x94 the King of mantras, yielding fruits and all\ngratifications like the Kalpa Tree. O Narada! At the time of worship, the lamp\nof ghee, was\n\n\n\np. 904\n\n\n\nlighted and dhup, sindura, sandal, offerings of food, flowers, etc., were\noffered to Her. Thus hymned by Hari, Tulasi came out of the tree, pleased. And\nShe gladly took refuge at His lotus feet. Vi _sn_ u, then, granted her boon\nthat, \xc2\x93You will be worshipped by all; I will keep you in My breast and in My\nhead and the Devas also will hold you on their heads.\xc2\x94 And He then took her to\nHis own abode.\n\n\n\n16\\. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Highly Fortunate One! What is Tulasi\xc2\x92s dhyan, stotra\nand method of worship? Kindly describe all these.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n17\\. Naraya _n_ a said :-- When Tulasi vanished, Hari became very much\nagitated at her bereavement and went to Vrindavana and began to praise her.\n\n\n\n18-44. The Bhagavan said :-- The Tulasi trees collect in multitudinous groups;\nhence the Pundits call it Vrinda. I praise that dear Tulasi. Of old, She\nappeared in the Vrindavana forest and therefore known as Vrindavani. I worship\nthat fortunate and glorious One. She is worshipped always in innumerable\nuniverses and is, therefore, known as Vis\xc2\x92vapujita (worshipped by all). I\nworship that Vis\xc2\x92vapujita. By whose contact, those countless universes are\nalways rendered pure and holy; and therefore She is called Vis\xc2\x92vapavani\n(purifying the whole universe). I am suffering from her bereavement, I\nremember the Devi. Without Tulasi, the Devas do not get pleased, though other\nflowers be heaped on them; therefore She is considered as the essence of all\nthe flowers. Now I am in sorrow and trouble and I am very eager to see her,\nwho is of the nature of purity incarnate. The whole universe gets delighted\nwhen the Bhaktas receive her; hence She is called Nandini; so may She be\npleased with me. There is nothing in the universe that can be compared to Her;\nhence She is called Tulasi; I take refuge of that clear Tulasi. That chaste\ndear one is the life of Kri _sn_ a, hence She is known as Kri _sn_ ajivani.\nNow may She save my life. O Narada! Thus praising, Ramapati remained there.\nThe chaste Tulasi then came to His sight and bowed down to His lotus feet;\nwhen She becoming sensitive out of the insult, began to weep. Bhagavan Vi _sn_\nu, seeing that sensitive dear one, immediately took her to His breast. Taking,\nthen, Sarasvati\xc2\x92s permission, He took her to His own home and brought about,\nfirst of all, the agreement between her and Sarasvati. Then He granted her the\nboon, \xc2\x93You will be worshipped by all, respected by all, and honoured by all;\nand all will carry you on their heads.\xc2\x94 I will also worship, respect and\nhonour you and keep you on My head. Receiving this boon from Vi _sn_ u, the\nDevi Tulasi became very glad.\n\n\n\np. 905\n\n\n\nSarasvati then attracted her to her side, made her sit close to her. Lak _s_\nmi and Ganga both with smiling faces attracted her and made her enter into the\nhouse. O Narada! Whosoever worships her with her eight names Vrinda,\nVrindavani, Vis\xc2\x92vapujita, Vis\xc2\x92vapavani, Tulasi, Pu _s_ pasara, Nandani and Kri\n_sn_ a Jivani and their meanings and sings this hymn of eight verses duly,\nacquires the merit of performing As\xc2\x92vamedha Yaj\xc3\xb1a (horse sacrifice).\nSpecially, on the Full Moon night of the month of Kartik, the auspicious birth\nceremony of Tulasi is performed. Of old Vi _sn_ u worshipped her at that time.\nWhoever worships with devotion on that Full Moon combination, the universe\npurifying Tulasi, becomes freed of all sins and goes up to the Vi _sn_ u Loka.\nOfferings of Tulasi leaves to Vi _sn_ u in the month of Kartik bring merits\nequal to those in giving away Ayuta Cows. Hearing this stotra at that period\ngives sons to the sonless persons, wives to the wifeless persons and friends\nto friendless persons. On hearing this stotra, the diseased become free of\ntheir diseases, the persons in bondage become free, the terrified become\nfearless, and the sinners are freed of their sins. O Narada! Thus it has been\nmentioned how to chant stotra to her. Now hear her dhyan and method of\nworship. In the Vedas, in the Ka _n_ va S\xc2\x92akha branch, the method of worship\nis given. You know that one is to meditate on the Tulasi plant, without any\ninvocation (avahana) and then worship her with devotion, presenting all sorts\nof offerings as required to her. Now hear Her Dhyanam. Of all the flowers,\nTulasi (the holy basil) is the best, very holy, and captivating the mind. It\nis a flame burning away all the fuel of sins committed by man. In the Vedas it\nis stated that this plant is called Tulasi, because there can be made no\ncomparison with Her amongst all the flowers. She is the holiest of them all.\nShe is placed on the heads of all and desired by all and gives holiness to the\nuniverse. She gives Jivanmukti, mukti and devotion to S\xc2\x92ri Hari. I worship\nHer. Thus meditating on Her and worshipping Her according to due rites, one is\nto bow down to Her. O Narada! I have described to you the full history of S\xc2\x92ri\nTulasi Devi. What more do yo want to hear now, say.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-fifth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the method of worship\nof Tulasi Devi in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 26](bk09ch26.htm)\n\n'
