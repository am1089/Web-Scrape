In non-division; because that is seen.\n\nIs the soul, when it has reached the highest light and freed itself from all\nbondage, conscious of itself as separate from the highest Self or as non-\nseparate in so far as being a mere 'mode' (prakara) of that Self?--The former\nview is the right one. For Scriptural and Sm _ri_ ti texts alike declare that\nthe released soul stands to the highest Self in the relation of fellowship,\nequality, equality of attributes, and all this implies consciousness of\nseparation. Compare 'He attains all desires together with the all-knowing\nBrahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); 'When the seer sees the shining maker, the\nLord, the Person who has his source in Brahman; then, possessing perfect\nknowledge, and shaking off good and evil, free from all passions he reaches\nthe highest equality' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 3); 'Taking their stand upon this\nknowledge they, attaining to an equality of attributes\n\np. 759\n\nwith me, are neither born at the time of a creation nor are they agitated when\na pralaya takes place' (Bha. Gi. XIV, 2).--Against this view the Sutra\ndeclares itself 'in non-division.' The released soul is conscious of itself as\nnon-divided from the highest Brahman. 'For this is seen,' i.e. for the soul\nhaving reached Brahman and freed itself from the investment of Nescience sees\nitself in its true nature. And this _true nature_ consists herein that the\nsouls have for their inner Self the highest Self while they constitute the\nbody of that Self and hence are _modes_ (prakara) of it. This is proved by all\nthose texts which exhibit the soul and Brahman in co-ordination--'Thou art\nthat' 'this Self is Brahman'; 'In that all this has its Self; 'All this in\ntruth is Brahman'; and by other texts, such as 'He who dwells within the Self,\nwhom the Self does not know, of whom the Self is the body,' &c.; and 'He who\nabides within, the ruler of creatures, he is thy Self; as explained by us\nunder Sutra I, 4, 22. The consciousness of the released soul therefore\nexpresses itself in the following form: 'I am Brahman, without any division.'\nWhere the texts speak of the soul's becoming equal to, or having equal\nattributes with, Brahman, the meaning is that the nature of the individual\nsoul--which is a mere mode of Brahman--is equal to that of Brahman, i.e. that\non putting off its body it becomes equal to Brahman in purity. The text\ndeclaring that the soul 'attains all its desires together with Brahman'\nintimates that the soul, together with Brahman of which it is a mode, is\nconscious of the attributes of Brahman. The different texts are thus in no\nconflict. Nor, on this view of the soul being non-divided from Brahman in so\nfar as being its mode, is there any difficulty on account of what is said\nabout the soul under Su. IV, 4, 8; or on account of the doctrines conveyed in\nII, 1, 22; III, 4, 8.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'non-division, on\naccount of its being seen.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5.
