How the \'old Toughs\' (H. M.\'s royal Regiment, now 2d Bn. Royal\nDublin Fusiliers), the only European corps within reach, when at last slipped\nfrom the leash at Panwell, marched seventy-two miles straight up over the\nGhauts to Poona, with but a single three hours\' halt en route; how they closed\nup their ranks of travel-soiled warriors and entered the British lines with\nband playing and colours flying; and how not a straggler dropped behind, \'for\nall knew that there must be a battle soon.\' Their arrival was the signal for\nthe Peishwa to throw off the mask, and the British Residency being untenable,\nour troops moved out to take up a safer position at Kirkee, about three miles\nfrom the city of Poona; and as they marched they saw all the houses of the\nResident and his suite fired by the enemy, who swarmed out of the city. As\nthey formed in line of battle, they anxiously watched the native regiments\ncoming up on their flank from Dapoorie, for that was the moment for successful\ntreachery, if the native soldiers were untrue! Not a Sepoy, however, in the\nBritish ranks wavered, though before the junction was complete a cloud of\nMahratta cavalry poured down upon them, dashed through the opening left\nbetween the two lines, enveloped either flank of the little army, and attacked\nthe European regiment in the rear. Then, as a last resource, the European\nregiment faced about their second rank, and kept up such a steady rolling fire\nto front and rear at the same time, that but few of the eager horsemen ever\ncame within spear\'s-length of the British bayonets.\n\nIn these days of rapid and far-reaching musketry fire, such a manoeuvre bids\nfair to supersede the formation of squares to resist cavalry, but up to that\nday it bad been but twice successfully attempted, as far as our military\nhistories told, even by \'the terrible infantry\' of England, and the veterans\nof the \'old Toughs\' were not a little proud to have succeeded in a movement\nwhich bad won for H. M.\'s 28th Regiment (now 1st Bnt Gloucestershire Regt.)\nthe unique honour of having a double number, on the back as well as the front\nof their caps.\n\nOne of the most touching recollections of those times attracted our notice\nalmost the last day we spent at Kirkee. An old chief, Jadowrow of Malagaom,\nhad come to take his ancestors were famous as a very ancient royal house,\nbefore the Mahomedans invaded the Deccan. The old man had borne arms as a\nyouthful commander of horse, when the great Duke was at Poona in 1802, just\nbefore the battle of Assaye; had been greatly distinguished for his gallantry\nin the battle of Kirkee, so fatal to his race, and had followed the fortunes\nof the Peishwa to the last. Disdaining to make separate terms for himself with\nthe English conqueror, he remained one of the few thoroughly faithful to his\nsovereign, not from love, for he loved not Bajee Row, but \'because he had\neaten his salt,\' and only after the Peishwa\'s surrender returned to his old\ncastle near Poona. There for many years he lived, hunting and hawking over his\ndiminished acres, and greatly respected as a model of a gallant and honourable\nold chief; but he could never be persuaded to revisit the capital of the\nMahrattas after its occupation by the English. \'He had no child,\' he said,\n\'and his race would die with him.\' At last, as years rolled on, an only son\nwas born to him; and then, touched by some unexpected act of liberality on the\npart of the British Government which would secure his ancestral estate to this\nchild of his old age,he resolved to go to Poona, and visited the Governor,\nwhose temporary residence happened to overlook the battle-field of Kirkee. He\ngazed long and wistfully from the drawing-room windows and said, \'This place\nis much changed since I was here last, fifty years ago. It was here the battle\nwas fought, and it was from near this very spot that we charged down that\nslope on the English line as it formed beyond that brook. I never thought to\nhave seen this place again.\'\n\nAs these pages are written the overland mail brings a letter written on gold-\nflowered paper, in beautiful square Mahratta characters. It is from the old\nchief. It asks no favour, save a photograph of an old friend he can never see\nagain, and conveys in terms of stately courtesy an assurance of his good-will\nand cordial recollection.\n\nNot many miles from Poona a beautiful obelisk of black basalt, rising from the\ngreat plain which stretches eastward, marks the village of Koreigaom. There, a\nfew weeks after the battle of Kirkee, a single battalion of Sepoys (the 1st\nBombay Grenadiers), with a few British gunners of the Madras Artillery, and\ntroopers of the Poona Horse, defended the open village for a whole day against\nthe Mahratta army, commanded by the Peishwa in person, and infuriated by their\nthen recent defeat at Kirkee.\n\nOf the heroes of that little band few, of course, now survive. When we visited\nKoreigaom, the most conspicuous among the crowd of villagers was a little\nMahratta boy, who over his ordinary garments had donned the full dress coatee\nof a native officer\'s uniform of half a century ago. He was the son of a\nJemadar (captain of native infantry), selected by Sir John Malcolm from among\nthe heroes of the Grenadiers, to hold a small grant of land which the wise\nliberality of the old Court of Directors had given in perpetuity to insure the\nsafeguard of the monument. The lad had carefully preserved his father\'s sword,\nsash, and cap, and had ranged them on a carpet in the little courtyard in\nfront of his door, that we might see them as we passed by to examine the scene\nof the struggle. A few only of the elders of the village remembered the day,\nwhen, as terrified children, they had hidden themselves while the battle\nraged; but all could point out the spots where every incident occurred. The\nmud houses of the village are clustered now, as then, on the summit of a large\nmound which overlooks the river Bheema, and on the highest point, at the\nintersection of the two irregular streets, is a little open space (as usual in\nMahratta villages), with the sacred tree, under which the elders congregate\nevery evening to hear the news, and to sit in conclave in front of the village\ntemple and choultry (or resting-place for travellers). These were the only\nstone buildings in the village. The massive square pillars of black basalt\nbear in bas-relief carvings of ages ago, scenes of battles of heroes and\ndemigods taken from the ancient national epic. This little temple though not\nmany feet square inside, was, from its strength and situation, the key of the\nposition. Commanding the street on one side, and overlooking the river on the\nother, it enabled a few men to protect the guns posted in the open space. Here\nwas the only shelter for the wounded. Our men had but partial possession of\nthe village, small as it was, for on the morning of the battle as they marched\nin to occupy it from one side, the advanced guard of the Mahratta army, of\nwhose approach they had, till a few minutes before, been unaware, swarmed in\nfrom the other (the river side), and the contest began when a few yards only\nseparated the leading combatants. The Peishwa took up his position on an\neminence at a little distance, and through the livelong day one body after\nanother of his choicest troops, Arabs and others, were Sent to overwhelm the\nhandful of British Sepoys. The enemy moved up under cover of the mud wails,\nand more than once succeeded in seizing our guns; but each time the Sepoys,\nadvancing with the bayonet, as long as an English officer remained to lead\nthem on, drove their foes back. Here, we were told, fell Pattinson, the\ngigantic adjutant. He was the son of a Cumberland clergyman, and was greatly\nbeloved by his men. Early in the day he bad been shot through the body, and\notherwise sorely wounded, and the men thought he was dead; but when he heard\nthe guns were taken by the enemy, he struggled to his feet, and, clubbing the\nmusket of a fallen Sepoy, struck down an Arab, and led his men once more with\na rush to recover the guns. At length every combatant European officer in that\npart of the position was killed or disabled, and then the young Assistant\nSurgeons Wylie and Wingate, leaving their wounded in the temple, took their\nswords, and, calling the almost exhausted men to follow them, twice led them\nto the charge, retook the precious guns, and restored the fortune of the day.\nIn one of these charges Wingate fell mortally wounded.\n\nThe greatest sufferings of the Sepoys were from thirst; the villagers had\ndepended on the sacred waters of the Bheema, and our men could see the clear\nstream running within a hundred yards of them; but it was death to drink it,\nfor those hundred yards were swept by the fire of the whole Peishwa\'s army,\nand no man could live to cross that space and return.\n\nAt length night closed on the unequal combat. The Peishwa, utterly dispirited\nby his failure to overwhelm even such a handful of British Sepoys unsupported\nby any body of Europeans, withdrew, and never again attempted to try the\nfortune of war in the field. The surviving remnant of the victors made good\ntheir retreat, carrying with them, among their other wounded, their gallant\nadjutant, to die and be laid in a soldier\'s grave at Seroor. 1\n\nAlmost every hill-fort and large village round Poona has some tradition, not\nonly of the days of Alumgeer, Sivagee, and of early Mahratta history, but of\nthe campaigns of Wellesley in 1802 and of the last great struggle in 1817-18;\nand many were the tales. like those above referred to, that still survive,\nmingled with recollections of Elphinstone\'s wisdom and noble generosity, and\nMalcolm\'s frankness; which it was pleasant to hear and verify in these days of\ncynical scepticism which affects to doubt alike the power of unsupported\nEuropean heroism, and the existence of courage, unselfish fidelity, and real\ngratitude among the natives; and which too often really does doubt the\npossibility of holding and governing India by the same means and in the same\nspirit by which our empire was acquired. Do we not, by such disbelief;\nsometimes risk the power to do such deeds as the last generation witnessed?\n\n### NOTE B.\n\nAnna\'s remarks on the contrast between the present dearth and the \'good old\ntimes\' of cheap bread, when the rupee went so much further than it does now,\nare very char. acteristic. The complaint, too, is very universal, and Is to be\nheard in the household of public functionaries, the highest as well as the\nlowest, in every grade of native society, and more or less in all parts of\nIndia. It is a complaint which deserves far more attentive consideration than\nit has hitherto received. Economists and statisticians are well aware that the\ngreat and steady rise in prices of late years in India is one of the\nconsequences of a great and long continued influx of the precious metals, and\ntherefore a symptom of the growing prosperity of the country; but the English\nsubaltern or railway engineer finds only that it leaves him at the end of the\nyear a poorer man than he would have been at home, when he expected to have\nbeen richer, and he is very apt to attribute his disappointment to the\nGovernment, and to imagine that he has been entrapped into a bad bargain.\n\nThe natives are naturally still less likely to weigh against the\ninconveniences of rising prices, the many advantages to all the labouring and\nmercantile classes with which high prices are accompanied, when caused by a\ncheapening of the precious metals; and very bitter are the invectives often\ndirected against the \'Government which makes bread dear.\'\n\nThe Narrator\'s notion that \'the English fixed the rupee at sixteen annas\' is\nanother specimen of a very widespread Indian popular delusion. The rupee\nalways consisted of sixteen annas, for the anna means only the sixteenth part\nof anything, but to the poor the great matter for consideration in all\nquestions of currency is the quantity of small change they can get for the\ncoin in which their wages are paid. Formerly this used to fluctuate with the\nprice of copper, and the quantity of copper change which a silver rupee would\nfetch varied as copper was cheap or dear, and was always greatest when the\ncopper currency was most debased. The English introduced all over India a\nuniform currency of copper as well as of silver, and none of course were\ngreater gainers in the long-run by this uniformity than the very poor. But, as\nusually happens in such cases, the memory of the occasional gain when the\nrupee brought more than its formal proportion of change, has outlived the\nrecollection of the more frequent loss when it brought less; and the popular\nintelligence, however it may smart under the evils of an uncertain and\nirregular currency, is slow to recognise the benefits of uniformity.\n\n### NOTE C.\n\nI am unable, at present, to give either the native words or music of this\ncurious little Calicut song. It is probably of Portuguese origin, or may have\nbeen derived from the Syrian Christians who have been settled on that coast\nsince the earliest ages.\n\nThe English translation of the words as explained to me by Anna, is as\nfollows:--\n\nPART I.\n\nTHE SONG FROM THE SHIP.\n\n(To be sung by one or more voices.)\n\n1\\. Very far went the ship, in the dark, up and down, up and down. There was\nvery little sky; the sailors couldn\'t see anything; rain was coming.\n\n2.. Now darkness, lightning, and very little rain; but big flashes, two yards\nlong, that looked as if they fell into the sea.\n\n3\\. On the third day the Captain looks Out for land, shading his eyes with his\nhand. There may be land. The sailors say to him, \'What do you see?" He\nanswers, \'Far off is the jungle, and, swinging in a tree, is an old monkey\nwith two little monkeys in her arms. We must be nearing land.\'\n\n4\\. Again the Captain looks out; the sailors say to him, \'What do you see?\' He\nanswers, \'On the shore there walks a pretty little maiden, with a chattee on\nher head; she skips, and runs, and dances as she goes. We must be nearing\nland.\n\n5\\. The storm begins to rage again, and hides the land: at last it clears a\nlittle. The sailors say to the Captain, \'What do you see?\' He answers \'I see a\nman ploughing; two bullocks draw the plough. We must be nearing land.\n\nIt is all true, they have gained the shore.\n\nPART II.\n\nSONG FROM THE SHORE.\n\n( _To be sung by one or more voices_.)\n\n1\\. The ship\'s on the sea--  \nWhich way is it coming?  \nRight home to land.  \nWhat cargo has it?  \nThe ship brings the sacrament and praying beads.\n\n2\\. The ship\'s on the sea--  \nWhich way is it coming?  \nRight home to land.  \nWhat cargo has it?  \nThe ship brings white paper and the Twelve Apostles.\n\n3\\. The ship comes home to land--  \nWhat cargo does it bring?  \nSilver money, prophets, and holy people.\n\n4\\. The ship comes home to land--  \nWhat does it bring?  \nAll the saints, and holy people, and Jesus Christ of Nazareth.\n\n5\\. The ship comes to our doors--  \nWho brings it home?  \nOur Saviour.  \nOur Saviour bless the ship, and bring it safely house.\n\nThe second song, \'The little Wife watching for her Husband\'s Return,\' Anna had\nalmost entirely forgotten.\n\nIt was, she said, very pretty, being the song of the little wife, as she decks\nherself in her jewels to please her husband when he comes home. She laments\nhis absence, and fears he has forgotten her, and bemoans her loneliness.\n\n![](img/51.jpg)\n\n(M.
