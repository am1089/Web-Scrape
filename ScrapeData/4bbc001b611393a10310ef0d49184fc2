On account of (its) passing out, moving and returning.\n\nThe Self is not omnipresent, but on the contrary, of atomic size (a _n_ u).--\nHow is this known?--Since Scripture says that it passes out, goes and returns.\nIts passing out is described in the following passage 'by that light this Self\ndeparts, either through the eye, or through the skull, or through other parts\nof the body' (B _ri._ Up. IV, 4, 2). Its going in the following text 'all\nthose who pass away out of this world go to the moon,' and its returning in\nthe text 'from that world he comes again into this world, for action.' All\nthis going, and so on, cannot be reconciled with the soul being present\neverywhere.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 21. And on account of the latter two being effected through the\nSelf](sbe48267.htm)\n\n"
