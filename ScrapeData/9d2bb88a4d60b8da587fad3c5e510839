Soma and Rudra, may you maintain your divine dominion, and may the\noblations reach you properly. Bringing the seven treasures to every house, be\nkind to our children and our cattle.\n\n2\\. Soma and Rudra, draw far away in every direction\n[1](sbe3258.htm#an_6:74:2:1) the disease [2](sbe3258.htm#an_6:74:2:2) which\nhas entered our house. Drive far away Nir _ri_ ti\n[3](sbe3258.htm#an_6:74:2:3), and may auspicious glories belong to us!\n\n3\\. Soma and Rudra, bestow all these remedies on our bodies. Tear away and\nremove from us  [1](sbe3258.htm#an_6:74:3:1) whatever evil we have committed,\nwhich clings to our bodies.\n\n4\\. Soma and Rudra, wielding sharp weapons and sharp bolts, kind friends, be\ngracious unto us here! Deliver us from the snare of Varu _n_ a, and guard us,\nas kind-hearted gods!\n\np. 435\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Bharadva _g_ a Barhaspatya. Verse 2 occurs TS. I, 8, 22, 5; AV.\nVII, 42, 1; verse 3, TS. I, 8, 22, 5; AV. VII, 42, 2. All the four verses, but\nin a different order (3, 1, 2, 4), in MS. IV, 11, 2; see also Ka _th_. XI, 12.\nMetre, Trish _t_ ubh.\n\nThis is the only hymn addressed to Soma and Rudra. In the _Kh_ andogya Up.\nIII, 7 and 9, the Rudras are said to have Indra, while the Maruts have Soma at\ntheir head.\n\nIt is translated by Geldner and Kaegi.\n\nThe whole hymn betrays its secondary character; first by violating the law of\ndecrease, secondly by duals in au before consonants, and thirdly by using a\nvery large number of passages from other hymns. Compare verse 1, pada c, with\nV, 1, 5, c; verse 2, pada c, with I, 24, 9, c; verse 2, pada d, with VI, 1,\n12, d. Phrases like verse 1, pada d, _s_ am na _h_ bhutam dvipade _s_ am _k_\natu _h_ pade, occur again and again, with slight modifications; see I, 114, 1;\n157, 3; VII, 54, 1; X, 165, 1. Sumanasyamana also is suspicious. It occurs\nagain in the next hymn, the last of the Ma _n_ _d_ ala, in VII, 33, 14,\nlikewise a suspected hymn, and in the tenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala, X, 51, 5; 7.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On vishu _k_ im, see II, 33, 2.\n\nNote 2. \xc3\x81miva has been identified with \xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xbd\xe1\xbf\x91\xce\xb1 by Fick, Orient und Occident, III,\np. 121. The difficulty is m = n.\n\nNote 3. The AV. reads ba\xc2\xb4dhetham duram nir _ri_ tim, the AV. and TS. read para\n_k_ ai _h_ k _ri_ tam _k_ id ena _h_ pra mumuktam asmat.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. AV. reads asmat for asme, and asat for asti. Verse 4. In the Maitr. S.\nthe second half of this verse is, mumuktam asma\xc2\xb4n grasita\xc2\xb4n abhi\xc2\xb4ke pra ya _k_\n_kh_ atam v _ri_ sha _n_ a _s_ antamani.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 46.
