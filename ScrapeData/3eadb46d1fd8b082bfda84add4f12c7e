In the intermediate place there is (a real) creation; for (scripture) says\n(that).\n\nIn the preceding pada we have set forth, with reference to the knowledge of\nthe five fires, the various stages of the soul's passing through the sa _m_\nsara. We shall now set forth the soul's different states (waking, dreaming,\n&c.)--Scripture says (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 9; 10), 'When he falls asleep--;\nthere are no chariots in that state, no horses, no roads, but he himself\ncreates chariots, horses, and roads,' &c.--Here a doubt arises whether the\ncreation thus taking place in dreams is a real one (paramarthika) like the\ncreation seen in the waking state, or whether it consists of illusion (maya).\n--The purvapakshin maintains that 'in the intermediate place (or state) there\nis (a real) creation.' By intermediate place we have to understand the place\nof dreams, in which latter sense the word is used in the Veda, 'There is a\nthird intermediate state, the state of dreams' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 9). That\nplace is called the intermediate place because it lies there where the two\nworlds, or else the place of waking and the place of bliss (deep sleep), join.\nIn that intermediate place the creation must be real; because scripture, which\nis authoritative, declares it to be so, 'He creates chariots, horses, roads,'\n&c. We, moreover, infer this from the concluding clause, 'He indeed is the\nmaker' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 10).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 2](sbe38105.htm)\n\n"
