The small (ether) (is Brahman), on account of the subsequent (arguments).\n\nThe _Kh_ andogas have the following text, \'Now in that city of Brahman there\nis the palace, the small lotus, and in it that small ether. Now what is within\nthat small ether that is to be sought for, that is to be understood\' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VIII, 1, 1).--The question here arises whether that small ether (space)\nwithin the lotus of the heart be the material clement called ether, or the\nindividual Self, or the highest Self.--The first view presenting itself is\nthat the element is meant, for the reason that the word \'ether\' is generally\nused in that sense; and because the clause \'what is within that small ether\'\nshows that the ether mentioned constitutes the abode of something else that is\nto be enquired into.--This view is set aside by the Sutra. The small ether\nwithin the heart is the highest Brahman, on account of the subsequent reasons,\ncontained in clauses of the same section. The passage \'That Self which is free\nfrom evil, free from old age, free from death, free from grief, free from\nhunger and thirst, whose wishes and purposes come true\' (VIII, 7, 1) ascribes\nto that small ether qualities--such as unconditioned Selfhood, freedom from\nevil, &c.--which clearly show that ether to be the highest Brahman. And this\nconclusion is confirmed by what other texts say about him who knows the small\nether attaining the power of realising his own wishes,\'Those who\n\np. 315\n\ndepart from hence having come to know the Self and those real wishes, for them\nthere is freedom in all worlds\'; and \'whatever object he desires, by his mere\nwill it comes to him; having obtained it he is happy\' ( _Kh_ , Up. VIII, 1, 6;\n2, 9). If moreover the ether within the heart were the elemental ether, the\ncomparison instituted in the passage \'As large as that (elemental) ether is,\nso large is this ether within the heart\' would be wholly inappropriate. Nor\nmust it be said that that comparison rests on the limitation of the ether\nwithin the heart (so that the two terms compared would be the limited\nelemental ether within the heart, and the universal elemental ether); for\nthere still would remain the inappropriate assertion that the ether within the\nheart is the abode of heaven, earth and all other things.--But, an objection\nis raised, also on the alternative of the small ether being the highest\nBrahman, the comparison to the universal elemental ether is unsuitable; for\nscripture explicitly states that the highest Self is (not as large but) larger\nthan everything else, \'larger than the earth, larger than the sky,\' &c. (\n_Kh_. Up. III, 14, 3). Not so, we reply; what the text says as to the ether\nwithin the heart being as large as the universal ether is meant (not to make a\nconclusive statement as to its extent but only) to negative that smallness of\nthe ether which is established by its abiding within the heart. Similarly we\nsay \'the sun moves with the speed of an arrow\'; the sun indeed moves much\nfaster than an arrow, but what our assertion means is merely that he does not\nmove slowly.--But, a further doubt is started, the passage \'That Self which is\nfree from sin,\' &c. does not appear to refer back to the small ether within\nthe heart. For the text makes a distinction between that ether and that within\nthat ether which it declares to be the due object of search and enquiry. This\nlatter object therefore is the topic of discussion, and when the text says\nlater on \'That Self, free from sin, &c. is to be searched out\' we must\nunderstand it to refer to the same object of search.--This would be so, we\nreply, if the text did not distinguish the small ether and that which abides\nwithin it; but as a matter of fact it\n\np. 316\n\ndoes distinguish the two. The connexion is as follows. The text at first\nrefers to the body of the devotee as the city of Brahman, the idea being that\nBrahman is present therein as object of meditation; and then designates an\norgan of that body, viz. the small lotus-shaped heart as the palace of\nBrahman. It then further refers to Brahman--the all knowing, all powerful,\nwhose love towards his devotees is boundless like the ocean--as the small\nether within the heart, meaning thereby that Brahman who for the benefit of\nhis devotees is present within that palace should be meditated upon as of\nminute size, and finally--in the clause \'that is to be searched out\'--enjoins\nas the object of meditation that which abides in that Brahman, i.e. on the one\nhand, its essential freedom from all evil qualities, and on the other the\nwhole treasure of its auspicious qualities, its power of realising its wishes\nand so on. The \'that\' (in \'that is to be searched out\') enjoins as objects of\nsearch the small ether, i.e. Brahman itself as well as the qualities abiding\nwithin it.--But how, it may be asked, do you know that the word \'that\' really\nrefers to both, viz. the highest Brahman, there called \'small ether,\' and the\nqualities abiding in it, and that hence the clause enjoins an enquiry into\nboth these entities?--Listen, attentively, we reply, to our explanation! The\nclause \'As large as this ether is, so large is this ether within the heart\'\ndeclares the exceeding greatness of the small ether; the clause \'Both heaven\nand earth are contained within it\' up to \'lightning and stars\' declares that\nsame small ether to be the abode of the entire world; and the clause \'And\nwhatever there is for him in this world, and whatever there is not, all that\nis contained within it\' declares that whatever objects of enjoyment there are\nfor the devotee in this world, and whatever other objects there are not for\nhim, i.e. are merely wishes but not obtained by him, all those objects are\ncontained within that same small ether. The text next declares that that small\nether, although dwelling within the heart which is a part of the body, is not\naffected by the body\'s old age and decay, for being extremely minute it is not\ncapable of change; and adds \'that true\n\np. 317\n\nbeing is the Brahman-city,\' i.e. that Reality which is the cause of all is the\ncity called Brahman, i.e. the abode of the entire Universe. The following\nclause \'in it all desires are contained\' again referring to the small ether\n(\'in it\') declares that in it all desires, i.e. all desirable qualities are\ncontained. The text next proceeds to set forth that the small ether possesses\nSelfhood and certain desirable auspicious qualities-this is done in the\npassage \'It is the Self free from sin\' &c. up to \'whose purposes realise\nthemselves.\' The following section--\'And as here on earth\' down to \'for them\nthere is freedom in all the worlds \'--declares that those who do not know\nthose eight qualities and the Self, called \'small ether,\' which is\ncharacterised by them, and who perform actions aiming at objects of enjoyment\ndifferent from that Self, obtain perishable results only, and do not attain\nthe power of realising their wishes; while those on the other hand who know\nthe Self called \'small ether\' and the qualities abiding within it, through the\ngrace of that very same highest Self, obtain all their wishes and the power of\nrealising their purposes. On the ground of this connected consideration of the\nwhole chapter we are able to decide that the text enjoins as the object of\nsearch and enquiry both the highest Brahman and the whole body of auspicious\nqualities abiding within it. This the Vakyakara also renders clear in the\npassage beginning \'In the text "what is within that" there is designation of\nwishes (i.e. desirable qualities).\'--For all these reasons the small ether is\nthe highest Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 14.
