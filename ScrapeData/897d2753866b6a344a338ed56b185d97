But it is mere Maya; on account of the true nature (of the soul) not being\nfully manifested.\n\nThe things appearing in dreams-chariots, lotus tanks, and so on--are absolute\nMaya, i.e. things created by the Supreme Person. For the term 'Maya' denotes\nwonderful things, as appears from passages such as 'She was born in the race\nof _G_ anaka, appearing like the wonderful power of the divine being in bodily\nshape' (devamaya). The sense of the passage 'there are no chariots,' &c. then\nis--there are no chariots and horses to be perceived by any other person but\nthe dreaming one; and then 'he creates chariots,' &c.--i. e. the Supreme\nPerson creates things to be perceived by the dreamer and persisting for a\ncertain time only. Those things therefore are of a wonderful nature (but not\nillusions). And the creation of such wonderful things is possible for the\nSupreme Person who can immediately realise all his wishes; but not for the\nindividual soul. The latter also, indeed, fundamentally possesses that power;\nbut as in the Sa _m_ sara state the true nature of the soul is not fully\nmanifested, it is then incapable of accomplishing such wonderful creations.\nThe text 'the person shaping one desired thing after the other' declares the\nSupreme Person to be the creator, for the clauses immediately preceding and\nfollowing that text (viz. 'He who is awake in those who sleep'; and 'that is\nthe Bright, that is Brahman, that alone is called the Immortal; all worlds are\ncontained in it and no one goes beyond'--Ka. Up. II, 5, 8) mention attributes\ndistinctively characteristic of the Supreme Person. And the B _ri_. Up. text,\n'For he is the maker,' must therefore, in agreement with the Ka _th_ a-text,\nalso be understood as declaring that it is the Supreme Person only that\ncreates the things seen in a dream.--But if it is the true nature of the soul\nto be free from all imperfections, and so on, why then does this not manifest\nitself?--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
