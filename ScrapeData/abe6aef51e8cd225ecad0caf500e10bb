He said, 'Gautama, what like is thy Agnihotra cow? what like the\ncalf? what like the cow joined by the calf? what like their meeting? what like\n(the milk) when being milked? what like when it has been milked? what like\nwhen brought (from the stable)? what like when put on the fire? what like when\nthe light is thrown on it 4; what like when water is poured thereto? what like\nwhen being taken off (the fire)? what like when taken off? what like when\n\np. 80\n\nbeing ladled out 1? what like when ladled out? what like when lifted up (to be\ntaken to the \xc3\x82havaniya)? what like when being taken there? what like when held\ndown 2?\n\n11:5:3:33\\. 'What like is the log thou puttest on? what like the first\nlibation? why didst thou put it down (on the Vedi 3)? why didst thou look away\n(towards the Garhapatya 4)? what like is the second libation?\n\n11:5:3:44\\. 'Why, having offered, dost thou shake it (the spoon)? why, having\ncleansed the spoon all round (the spout), didst thou wipe it on the grass-\nbunch? why, having cleansed it a second time all over, didst thou place thy\nhand on the south (part of the Vedi)? why didst thou eat (of the milk) the\nfirst time, and why the second time? why, on creeping away (from the Vedi),\ndidst thou drink (water)? why, having poured water into the spoon, didst thou\nsprinkle therewith? why didst thou sprinkle it away a second time, and why a\nthird time in that (northerly) direction? why didst thou pour down water\nbehind the \xc3\x82havaniya? why didst thou bring (the offering) to a close? If thou\nhast offered the Agnihotra knowing this, then it has indeed been offered by\nthee;\n\np. 81\n\nbut if (thou hast offered it) not knowing this, then it has not been offered\nby thee.'\n\n11:5:3:55\\. He (Uddalaka) said, 'My Agnihotra cow is I _d_ a, Manu's daughter\n1; my calf is of Vayu's nature; the (cow) joined by the calf is in conjunction\ntherewith 2; their meeting is the Vira _g_ ; (the milk) when being milked\nbelongs to the A _s_ vins, and when it has been milked, to the Vi _s_ ve Deva\n_h_ ; when brought (from the stable) it belongs to Vayu; when put on (the\nfire), to Agni; when the light is thrown on it, it belongs to Indra and Agni;\nwhen water is poured thereto it belongs to Varu _n_ a; when being taken off\n(the fire), to Vayu; when it has been taken off, to Heaven and Earth; when\nbeing ladled out, to the A _s_ vins; when it has been ladled out, to the Vi\n_s_ ve Deva _h_ ; when lifted up, to Mahadeva; when being taken (to the\n\xc3\x82havaniya), to Vayu; when held down, to Vish _n_ u.\n\n11:5:3:66\\. 'And the log I put on (the fire) is the resting-place of the\nlibations; and as to the first libation, I therewith gratified the gods; and\nwhen I laid down (the spoon with the milk), that belongs to B _ri_ haspati;\nand when I looked away, then I joined together this and yonder world; and as\nto the second libation, I thereby settled myself in the heavenly world.\n\n11:5:3:77\\. 'And when, having offered, I shake (the spoon), that belongs to\nVayu; and when, having cleansed the spoon all round (the spout), I wiped it on\nthe grass-bunch, then I gratified the herbs and trees;\n\np. 82\n\nand when, having cleansed it a second time all over, I placed my hand on the\nsouth (part of the altar-ground), then I gratified the Fathers 1; and when I\nate (of the milk) the first time, then I gratified myself; and when (I ate) a\nsecond time, then I gratified my offspring; and when, having crept away (from\nthe altar-ground), I drank (water), then I gratified the cattle; and when,\nhaving poured water into the spoon, I sprinkled therewith, then I gratified\nthe snake-deities; and when (I sprinkled) a second time, then (I gratified)\nthe Gandharvas and Apsaras; and when, a third time, I sprinkled it away in\nthat (northerly) direction, then I opened the gate of heaven; and when I\npoured down water behind the altar, then I bestowed rain on this world; and\nwhen I brought (the sacrifice) to a close, then I filled up whatever there is\ndeficient in the earth.'--'This much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in\ncommon 2,' said ( _S_ au _k_ eya).\n\n11:5:3:88\\. _S_ au _k_ eya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a\nquestion, reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Pra _k_ inayogya!' he replied. He ( _S_\nau _k_ eya) said, 'If, at the time when thy fires are taken out, and the\nsacrificial vessels brought down, thou wert going to offer, and the offering-\nfire were then to go out, dost thou know what danger there is in that case for\nhim who offers?' 'I know,' he replied; 'before long the eldest son would die\nin the case of him who would\n\np. 83\n\nnot know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What is\nthat knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.--'The breath of the mouth\nhas entered the upward breathing--such (is the knowledge); and I should make\nthe offering in the Garhapatya fire--that would be the atonement, and I should\nnot be committing that sin.'--'This much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in\ncommon,' said ( _S_ au _k_ eya).\n\n11:5:3:99\\. _S_ au _k_ eya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a\nquestion, reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Pra _k_ inayogya!' he replied. He said,\n'If, at that very time, the Garhapatya fire were to go out, dost thou know\nwhat danger there is in that case for him who offers? I know it,' he replied;\n'before long the master of the house 1 would die in the case of him who would\nnot know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What is\nthat knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.--'The upward breathing has\nentered the breath of the mouth--this (is the knowledge); and I would make the\noffering on the \xc3\x82havaniya--this would be the atonement, and I should not be\ncommitting that sin.'--'This much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in\ncommon,' said ( _S_ au _k_ eya).\n\n11:5:3:1010\\. _S_ au _k_ eya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a\nquestion, reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Pra _k_ inayogya!' he replied. He said,\n'If, at that very time, the Anvaharyapa _k_ ana fire were to go out, dost thou\nknow what danger there is in that case for him who offers?'--'I know it,' he\nreplied; 'before long all the cattle would die in the case of him who would\n\np. 84\n\nnot know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What is\nthat knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.---'The through-breathing\nhas entered the upward breathing--this (is the knowledge); and I would make\nthe offering on the Garhapatya fire--this is the atonement; and I should not\nbe committing that sin.'--'This much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in\ncommon,' said ( _S_ au _k_ eya).\n\n11:5:3:1111\\. _S_ au _k_ eya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a\nquestion, reverend sir.'--'Ask, then, Pra _k_ inayogya!' he replied. He said,\n'If, at that very time, all the fires were to go out, dost thou know what\ndanger there is in that case for him who offers?'--'I know it,' he replied;\n'before long the family would be without heirs in the case of him who would\nnot know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What is\nthat knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.--'Having, without delay,\nchurned out fire, and taken out an offering-fire in whatever direction the\nwind might be blowing, I would perform an offering to Vayu (the wind): I would\nthen know that my Agnihotra would be successful, belonging as it would to all\ndeities; for all beings, indeed, pass over into the wind, and from out of the\nwind they are again produced 1. This would be the atonement, and I should not\nbe committing that sin.'--'This much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in\ncommon,' said ( _S_ au _k_ eya).\n\n11:5:3:1212\\. _S_ au _k_ eya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a\nquestion, reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Pra _k_ inayogya!'\n\np. 85\n\nhe replied. He said, 'If at that very time all the fires were to go out, when\nthere should be no wind blowing, dost thou know what danger there would be for\nhim who offers?'--'I know it,' he replied; 'unpleasant things, indeed, he\nwould see in this world, and unpleasant things in yonder world, were he not to\nknow this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What is that\nknowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.--'Having, without delay, churned\nout fire, and taken out an offering-fire towards the east, and sat down behind\nit, I myself would drink (the Agnihotra milk): I should then know that my\nAgnihotra would be successful, belonging as it would to all deities, for all\nbeings, indeed, pass into the Brahma _n_ a 1, and from the Brahma _n_ a they\nare again produced. That would be the atonement; and I should not be\ncommitting that sin.'--'And, verily, I did not know this,' said ( _S_ au _k_\neya).\n\n11:5:3:1313\\. _S_ au _k_ eya, thus instructed, said, 'Here are logs for fuel:\nI will become thy pupil, reverend sir.' He replied, 'If thou hadst not spoken\nthus, thy head would have flown off 2: come, enter as my pupil!'--'So be it,'\nhe said. He then initiated him, and taught him that pain-conquering utterance,\nTruth: therefore let man speak naught but truth 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[79:3](sbe44027.htm#fr_268) Saya _n_ a takes 'brahmodyam agnihotram' together,\nin the sense 'the sacred truth' regarding (or, in the form of) the Agnihotra,\n--agnihotravishaya _m_ brahmodya _m_ brahmatattvasya rupa _m_ pratipadyate\nyena tad vividishami tadvishaya _m_ vedane _k_ _kh_ a _m_\nkarishyamityadinabhipraye _n_ agata _h_. Unless 'brahmodyam' could be taken as\nan adjective, I do not see how it is possible to adopt Saya _n_ a's\ninterpretation.\n\n[79:4](sbe44027.htm#fr_269) For letting the light of a burning straw fall on\nthe milk to see whether it is done, see II, 3, 1, 16.\n\n[80:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_270) Viz. by the dipping-spoon (sruva) into the ladle\n(agnihotrahavani), see II, 3, 1, 17.\n\n[80:2](sbe44027.htm#fr_271) Whilst taking the oblation to the \xc3\x82havaniya, he\nholds the spoon level with his mouth, except when he is in a line between the\ntwo fires, when for a moment he lowers the spoon so as to be level with his\nnavel.\n\n[80:3](sbe44027.htm#fr_272) This refers to the putting down of the spoon\ncontaining the milk on the grass-bunch prior to the second libation; cf. II,\n3, 1, 17. One might also translate, 'what is that (or does it mean) that thou\ndidst put it down?'\n\n[80:4](sbe44027.htm#fr_273) Thus Saya _n_ a,--apaikshish _th_ a _h_\ngarhapatasyaiksha _n_ am k _ri_ tavan asi.\n\n[81:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_274) See the legend, I, 8, 1, 1 seqq.\n\n[81:2](sbe44027.htm#fr_275) That is, according to Saya _n_ a, 'the sky allied\nwith Vayu, the wind,'--vayuna sa _m_ s _ri_ sh _t_ a dyau _h_.\n\n[82:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_276) The departed ancestors are supposed to reside in\nthe southern region.\n\n[82:2](sbe44027.htm#fr_277) He bhagavann Uddalaka bhavatoktam etat sava (?\nsaha) nav avayo _h_ saha sahita _m_ samanam ekarupam iti _S_ au _k_ eyo ha\nbhuktavan (? hy uktavan) anyapra _s_ na _m_ dar _s_ ayita _m_ prastauti, Sau\n_k_ eyo _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ apta iti, Say.\n\n[83:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_278) That is, the Sacrificer himself.\n\n[84:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_279) At the time of dissolution (layakale) they pass\ninto the wind; and at the time of creation (s _ri_ sh _t_ ikale) they are\nagain created, Say.\n\n[85:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_280) Viz. as the representative of the Brahman, or\nworld-spirit.\n\n[85:2](sbe44027.htm#fr_281) Yadaiva _m_ navakshya _h_ yadaivam a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana\n_m_ navishkaroshi to murdha vyapatishyat, murdha(va)patana _m_ sva _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nanapraka _t_ anenatrabhavata _h_ parih _ri_ tam iti, Say.--Prof. Delbruck,\nAltind. Syntax, p. 366, takes 'vi-pat' in the sense of--(thy head would have)\nflown asunder, or burst; which is indeed possible; cf. XI, 4, I, 9.\n\n[85:3](sbe44027.htm#fr_282) Cf. F.
