Now follows the udgitha of the dogs. Vaka Dalbhya, or, as he was also\ncalled, Glava Maitreya, went out to repeat the Veda (in a quiet place).\n\n2\\. A white (dog) appeared before him, and other dogs gathering round him,\nsaid to him: 'Sir, sing and get us food, we are hungry.'\n\n3\\. The white dog said to them: 'Come to me to-morrow morning.' Vaka Dalbhya,\nor, as he was also called, Glava Maitreya, watched.\n\n4\\. The dogs came on, holding together, each dog keeping the tail of the\npreceding dog in his mouth, as the priests do when they are going to sing\npraises with the Vahishpavamana hymn 2. After they had settled down, they\nbegan to say Hi\xe1\xb9\x85.\n\n5\\. 'Om, let us eat! Om, let us drink! Om, may the divine Varu _n_ a, Pra _g_\napati, Savit _ri_  3 bring us food! Lord of food, bring hither food, bring it,\nOm!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[21:1](sbe01032.htm#fr_114) There are certain etymological fancies for\nassigning each deity to a certain portion of the Sama-veda ceremonial. Thus\npra _n_ a is assigned to the prastava, because both words begin with pra.\n\xc3\x82ditya is assigned to the udgitha, because the sun is ut. Anna, food, is\nassigned to the pratihara, because food is taken, pratih _ri_ yate, &c.\n\n[21:2](sbe01033.htm#fr_115) This alludes to a ceremony where the priests have\nto walk in procession, each priest holding the gown of the preceding priest.\n\n[21:3](sbe01033.htm#fr_116) The commentator explains Varu _n_ a and Pra _g_\napati as epithets of Savit _ri_ , or the sun, meaning rain-giver and man-\nprotector.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 13](sbe01034.htm)\n\n"
