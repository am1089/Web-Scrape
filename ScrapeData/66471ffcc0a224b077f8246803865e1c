And Sm _ri_ ti also says that.\n\nIn the Mahabharata also it is said that those who know do not go or depart,\n'He who has become the Self of all beings and has a complete intuition of all,\nat his way the gods themselves are perplexed, seeking for the path of him who\nhas no path.'--But, an objection is raised, other passages speak of men\nknowing Brahman as going, so e.g. ' _S_ uka the son of Vyasa being desirous of\nrelease travelled to the sphere of the sun; being called by his father who had\nfollowed him, he gave an answering shout.'--That passage, we reply, describes\n(not the effects of the highest knowledge but only) how an embodied person,\nthrough the power of Yoga (which is of the nature of the lower knowledge),\nreached some special place and freed himself from the body. This appears from\nit being mentioned that he was seen by all beings; for the beings could not\nsee a person moving without a body. The conclusion of the story makes all this\nclear, ' _S_ uka having moved through the air more rapidly than wind, and\nhaving shown his power, was known by all beings.'--It thus follows that he who\nknows Brahman neither moves nor departs. To what sphere the scriptural texts\nabout going and so on refer we shall explain later on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 15](sbe38295.htm)\n\n"
