My parents  \nare by me unharmed.  \nUnited are ye all: with bliss unite me. Parted are ye, keep  \nme apart from evil.  \n12 The Asvins, the Physicians, Gods, stretched out the healing  \nsacrifice,  \nSarasvati with speech was a Physician, all with heroic powers  \ninvesting Indra.  \n13 Symbols of Diksha are grass buds, of Prayaniya sprouts of  \ncorn,  \nOf Soma-purchasing fried grains are symbols, Soma-shoots  \nand meath.  \n14 \xc3\x82tithya's sign is Masara, the Gharma's symbol Nagnahu.  \nThree nights with Sura poured, this is the symbol of the  \nUpasads.  \n15 Emblem of purchased Soma is Parisrut, foaming drink effused:  \nIndra's balm milked for Indra by the Asvins and Sarasvati.  \n16 The Sacrificer's seat is the throne's symbol, the jar containing  \nSura of the Altar.  \nThe mid-space is the northern Altar's symbol: the cloth for  \nfiltering is the physician.  \n17 Altar by Altar is produced, power, holy grass by holy grass.  \nThe stake is by the stake obtained, by Agni Agni carried  \nforth.  \n18 The Asvins are the Soma store, Sarasvati the sacred hearth.  \nFor Indra formed is Indra s seat, the Matrons' Hall, the  \nhouse-lord's fire.\n\np. 175\n\n19 Orders he gains by orders, by \xc3\x82pris \xc3\x82pris of sacrifice,  \nPost-offerings by fore-offerings, and by calls of Vashat \xc3\x82hutis.  \n20 By victims he gains victims, by ground rice-cakes sacrificial  \nfood,  \nBy metres kindling-verses, and Vashat-calls by Inviting  \nprayers.  \n21 Grain roasted, gruel, barley-meal, grains of rice roasted, milk  \nand curd  \nAre types of Soma: mingled milk, sweet whey, of sacrificial  \nfood.  \n22 Type of parched corn is jujube-fruit; wheat of the roasted  \ngrains of rice; Jujube the type of barley-meal, and Indra-grains  \nof gruel-groats.  \n23 Symbol of milk are barley-grains, symbol of curd are  \njujube-fruits.  \nWhey is the type of Soma, and milk-mixture type of  \nSoma's pap.  \n24 The Strophe is the cry, Bid hear? the answer is the antistrophe.  \nSacrifice! is the Dhayya's form, Pragathas\xc2\x92 the Yajamahas.  \n25 By verse-halves comes the Ukthas\xc2\x92 type, Nivids by Padas he  \nobtains.  \nThe type of Sastras is obtained by Pranavas, Soma by milk.\n\np. 176\n\n26 Gained by the Asvins is the morn's libation, Indra's libation  \nof mid-day by Indra.  \nSarasvati obtains the third outpouring, the offering sacred  \nto the Visve Devas.  \n27 By Vayu cups he gains the cups of Vayu, and by the basket  \ngains the vat for Soma.  \nBy the two jars he gains two cleansing-vessels, and by the  \ncooking-pot the pot for cooking.  \n23 By sacrificial texts are gained the Grahas, and by the Grahas  \nlauds and laud-arrangements.  \nBy metres are obtained Ukthas and praise-songs, and by the  \nSama-chant the Avabhritha.  \n29 Draughts he obtains by pouring out libations, and wishes  \nby the utterance of praises,  \nBy Samyu he obtains Patnisamyajas, and Consummation by  \nSamishtayajus.  \n30 He gains by vow of fasting Consecration, by Consecration  \ngains the priestly guerdon.  \nHe gains by priestly guerdon faith: by faith comes knowledge  \nof the truth.  \n31 So far the type of sacrifice was formed by Brahma, and the  \nGods.  \nAll this he gains, when juice is shed, in the Santramani  \nsacrifice.  \n32 The rite with sacred grass, wine, store of heroes, the mighty  \nones speed on with adorations.  \nMay we, sweet-singing sacrificers, setting Soma mid Gods in  \nheaven, give joy to Indra.\n\np. 177\n\n33 All essence of thine own in plants collected, all strength of  \nSoma when poured out with Sura\xc2\x97  \nTherewith impel with joy the sacrifice, Sarasvati, the Asvins,  \nIndra, Agni.  \n34 That which Sarasvati poured out for Indra, by Asvins  \nbrought from Namuchi the demon,  \nThis flowing drop, brilliant and full of sweetness, I drink  \nand feed on here, the King, the Soma.  \n35 Whatever portion of the savoury fluid is clinging here,  \nwhat Indra drank with powers,  \nThat drop thereof with pure and holy spirit I drink and  \nfeed upon, the King, the Soma.  \n36 To Fathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage!  \nTo Grandfathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and homage!  \nTo Great-grandfathers who claim Svadha be Svadha and  \nhomage!  \nThe Fathers have eaten. The Fathers have rejoiced. The  \nFathers have been satisfied, Fathers, be ye purified.  \n37 Cleanse me the Fathers who enjoy Soma! Grandfathers  \nmake me clean!  \nMay Great-grandfathers cleanse me with a sieve that brings  \na century.  \nMay my Grandfathers cleanse me, may my Great-grand-fathers  \nmake me clean.  \nWith sieve that brings a century may I obtain full length  \nof life.  \n33 Agni, thou poorest life: send down upon us food and vigorous  \nstrength.  \nDrive thou misfortune far away.\n\np. 178\n\n39 Cleanse me the companies of Gods! May thoughts with  \nspirit make me clean.  \nCleanse me all things that be! Do thou, O Jatavedas, make  \nme clean.  \n40 Purify me, O Agni, God, refulgent with thy pure bright  \nsieve,  \nWith powers according to thine own.  \n41 O Agni, may the cleansing sieve, diffused through all thy  \nfiery glow,  \nHoly devotion, make me clean.  \n42 May Pavamana with his sieve, Guest of all tribes, cleanse  \nus to-day,  \nHe who is Cleanser make us clean.  \n43 Savitar, God, by both of these, libation, purifying power,  \nPurify me on every side.  \n44 Dear to all Gods hath come the cleansing Goddess, she who  \ncontains these many smooth-backed figures.  \nThrough her may we in sacrificial banquets taking our pleasure  \nbe the lords of riches.  \n45 The Fathers who in Yama's realm are equal and unanimous\xc2\x97  \nTheir world is Svadha, reverence. To Gods let sacrifice be  \npaid.  \n46 Equals, unanimous, my folk yet living among those who  \nlive\xc2\x97  \nOn me be set their glory through a hundred years in this  \nour world.\n\np. 179\n\n47 I have heard mention of two several pathways, way of the  \nFathers, way of Gods and mortals.  \nOn these two roads each moving creature travels, each  \nthing between the Father and the Mother.  \n48 May this my sacrifice bring store of children, with ten  \nbrave sons, full-companied, for welfare\xc2\x97  \nLife-winning, winning offspring, winning cattle, winning this  \nworld of ours and peace and safety.  \nMay Agni make nay progeny abundant. Do ye confer food,  \nmilk, and wanly vigour.  \n49 May they ascend, the lowest, highest, midmost, the Fathers  \nwho deserve a share of Soma.  \nMay Fathers who have gained the world of spirits, gentle  \nand righteous, aid us when we call them.  \n50 Our Fathers are Angirases, Navagvas, Atharvans, Bhrigus,  \nwho deserve the Soma.  \nMay these the holy look on us with favour: may we enjoy  \ntheir gracious loving-kindness.  \n51 Our ancient Fathers who deserve the Soma, who came, most  \nnoble, to our Soma banquet\xc2\x97  \nWith these let Yama, yearning with the yearning, rejoicing  \neat our offerings at his pleasure.  \n52 Thou, Soma, art preeminent for wisdom: along the straightest  \npath thou art our leader.  \nOur prudent Fathers by thy wisdom, Soma, dealt out  \namong the Gods their share of treasure.  \n53 For our sage Fathers, Soma Pavamana, of old performed by  \nthee their sacred duties.  \nFighting unvanquished, open the enclosures: enrich us  \nwith large gifts of steeds and heroes.\n\np. 180\n\n54 Associate with the Fathers thou, O Soma, hast spread thyself  \nabroad through earth and heaven.  \nSo with oblation let us serve thee, Indu, and so let us become  \nthe lords of riches.  \n55 Fathers who sit on sacred grass, come help us: these offerings  \nwe have made for you; accept them.  \nSo come to us with most auspicious favour, and give us  \nhealth and strength without a trouble.  \n56 I have attained the gracious-minded Fathers, have gained  \na son and progeny from Vishnu.  \nThey who enjoy pressed juices with oblation, seated on  \nsacred grass, come oftenest hither.  \n57 May they, the Fathers, worthy of the Soma, invited to their  \nfavourite oblations  \nLaid on the sacred grass, come nigh and listen: may they  \nbe gracious unto us and bless us.  \n58 May they our Fathers whom the flames have tasted, worthy  \nof Soma, come on God-ward pathways.  \nEnjoying at this sacrifice their portion, may they be gracious  \nunto us and bless us.  \n59 Fathers whom Agni's flames have tasted, come ye nigh:  \nye kindly leaders, take ye each your proper place.  \nEat sacrificial food presented on the grass: grant riches  \nwith a multitude of hero sons.\n\np. 181\n\n60 For those who, burnt with fire or not cremated, joy in their  \nportion in the midst of heaven,  \nMay the Self-Ruler form the world of spirits and this their  \nbody as his pleasure wills it.  \n61 We call the Agnishvattas, true to seasons, those who drank  \nSoma in the Narasamsa.  \nPrompt to give ear to us be they, the sages, and then let  \nus be lords of wealth and treasure.  \n62 Bowing the bended knee and seated southward, accept ye,  \nall, this sacrifice with favour.  \nInjure us not for any sin, O Fathers, which we through  \nhuman frailty have committed.  \n63 Lapped in the bosom of the purple Mornings give riches  \nto the man who brings oblation.  \nGrant to his sons a portion of your treasure, and, present,  \ngive us energy, ye Fathers.  \n64 O Agni Kavyavahana, cause us to praise before the Gods,  \nAs our associate meet for lauds, wealth which e\xc2\x92en thou reputest  \nwealth.  \n65 May Agni, Kavya-bearer, who hath worshipped Fathers  \ntrue to Law.  \nAnnounce to Gods and Fathers these our sacrificial offerings.  \n66 Thou. Agni Kavya-bearer, when entreated, didst bear the  \nofferings which thou madest fragrant,  \nAnd gayest to the Fathers who did eat them with Svadha.  \nEat, thou God, the gifts we bring thee.\n\np. 182\n\n67 Thou, Jatavedas, knowest well the number of Fathers who  \nare here and who are absent,  \nOf Fathers whom we know and whom we know not. Accept  \nthe sacrifice arranged with portions.  \n68 Now let us pay this homage to the Fathers, to those who  \npassed of old and those who followed,  \nThose who have rested in the earthly region and those who  \ndwell among the Mighty Races.  \n69 As in the days of old our ancient Fathers speeding the work  \nof holy worship, Agni!  \nSought pure light and devotion, singing praises, they cleft  \nthe ground and made red Dawns apparent.  \n70 Right gladly do we set thee down, right gladly make thee  \nburn and glow.  \nGladly bring yearning Fathers nigh to eat the food of  \nsacrifice.  \n71 Indra, with waters\xc2\x92 foam didst thou wrench off the head of  \nNamuchi,  \nSubduing all contending hosts.  \n72 King Soma, pressed, the Drink of Life, left Death behind  \nwith Soma-dregs.  \nBy Law came truth and Indra-power, the pure bright drinking-off  \nof juice. The power of Indra was this sweet immortal  \nmilk.  \n73 The Snipe of Angiras by thought from out the waters  \ndrank up milk.  \nBy Law came truth, etc., as in 72.\n\np. 183\n\n74 The Hamsa throned in light drank up by metre Soma from  \nthe floods.  \nBy Law, etc.  \n75 Prajapati by Brahma drank the essence from the foaming  \nfood, the princely power, milk, Soma juice. By Law, etc.  \n76 The generative part enters the _yoni:_ it leaves aside the  \n_retas_ and the _m utra_.  \nThe caul-invested embryo leaves by its birth the covering  \nfolds. By Law, etc.  \n77 Viewing both forms Prajapati gave truth and falsehood  \ndifferent shapes.  \nPrajapati assigned the lack of faith to falsehood, faith to  \ntruth. By Law, etc.  \n78 By holy lore Prajapati drank up both forms, pressed and  \nunpressed.  \nBy Law, etc.  \n79 Seeing the farming liquor's sap, Prajapati with the bright  \ndrank nut the bright the milk, the Soma juice. By Law,  \netc.  \n80 Wise, with mind, lead, and thread of wool the sages twine  \nan amulet.  \nSarasvati, Savitar, Varuna, the Asvins span sacrifice and  \nhealed his form for Indra.  \n81 This his immortal shape with mighty powers three Deities  \nbestowing gifts compounded.  \nHis hair they made with sprouts of grass and barley, and  \nroasted grain with skin and flesh supplied him.  \n82 His inner shape Sarasvati arranges and, borne on bright  \npaths, the Physician Asvins:  \nWith Masaras and sieve his bone and marrow, as on the  \nOxen's hide they lay the liquor.\n\np. 184\n\n83 By thought Sarasvati with both Nasatyas forms lovely treasure  \nand a beauteous body.  \nLike shuttle through the loom the steady ferment mixes  \nthe red juice with the foaming spirit.  \n84 By milk they generated bright immortal, productive seed,  \nby Sura seed from urine,  \nChasing afar folly and ill intention, crude food and wind  \nand meat that loads the stomach.  \n85 Heart with his heart Indra Good Guardian gendered: with  \nrice-cake Savitar gave truth its being.  \nVaruna, doctoring the lungs and liver, forms, as with Vayu  \ncups, the gall and kidneys.  \n86 Cooking-pots pouring honey were the entrails: like a  \nwell-milking cow the pans were bowels.  \nA hawk's wing was the spleen: through mighty powers the  \nstool as mother was navel and belly.  \n87 The pitcher was the father of the rectum by powers, the  \nwomb which first contained the infant.  \nPlain was the hundred-streaming fount as penis: the jar  \npoured forth libations to the Father.  \n88 His face the basket, thence his head; the strainer his  \ntongue, his mouth Sarasvati and Asvins.  \nThe Chapya was his rump, his leech the filter, the bladder  \nwas his penis keen with ardour.  \n89 Asvins with both cups made his eye immortal, the goat and  \ncooked oblation gave it keenness.  \nWith wheat eyelashes and with jujube eyebrows they clothe  \nas \xc2\x92twere a black and brilliant figure.  \n90 The sheep, the ram to give his nostril vigour. the immortal  \npath of breath by both libations.  \nBy Indra-grains and sacrificial jujubes Sarasvati produced  \nthrough-breath and nose hairs.\n\np. 185\n\n91 The hull for strength made Indra's form: the immortal  \nbearing for both his ears by two libations.  \nBarley and sacred grass composed his eyebrows: from his  \nmouth came the jujube and sweet honey.  \n92 Hair of the wolf was on his waist and body: the beard upon  \nhis face was hair of tigers.  \nLions hair were his locks, for fame and beauty, worn on  \nhis head, his crest and sheen and vigour.  \n93 The Asvins, Leeches, joined his limbs and body, Sarasvati  \nput limbs and frame together,  \nGiving the form and vital power of Indra, hundredfold,  \ndeathless and delightful lustre.  \n94 Sarasvati, as Consort of the Asvins, bears in her womb the  \nnobly fashioned Infant.  \nKing Varuna with waters\xc2\x92 wealthy essence begetting Indra  \nin the floods for glory.  \n95 Splendour of victims, powerful oblation, honey and meath  \nwith milk and foaming liquor,  \nHealing Sarasvati effused, and Asvins; from pressed and  \nunpressed Soma, deathless Indu.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XX](wyvbk20.htm)\n\n"
