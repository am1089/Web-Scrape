XIII.\n\nLegend of Bharata. Bharata abdicates his throne, and becomes an ascetic:\ncherishes a fawn, and becomes so much attached to it as to neglect his\ndevotions: he dies: his successive births: works in the fields, and is pressed\nas a palankin-bearer for the Raja of Sauvira: rebuked for his awkwardness: his\nreply: dialogue between him and the king.\n\nMAITREYA.--Reverend sir 1, all that I asked of you has been thoroughly\nexplained; namely, the situation of the earth, oceans, mountains, rivers, and\nplanetary bodies; the system of the three worlds, of which Vishn\xcc\x81u is the\nstay. The great end of life has also been expounded by you, and the\npreeminence of holy knowledge. It now remains that you fulfil the promise you\nmade some time since 2, of relating to me the story of king Bharata, and how\nit happened that a monarch like him, residing constantly at the sacred place\n\xc5\x9aalagrama, and engaged in devotion, with his mind ever applied to Vasudeva,\nshould have failed, through time sanctity of the shrine, and the efficacy of\nhis abstractions, to obtain final emancipation; how it was that he was born\nagain as a Brahman; and what was done by the magnanimous Bharata in that\ncapacity: all this it is fit that you inform me.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The illustrious monarch of the earth resided, Maitreya, for a\nconsiderable period at \xc5\x9aalagrama, his thoughts being wholly dedicated to god,\nand his conduct distinguished by kindness and every virtue, until he had\neffected, in the highest degree, the entire control over his mind. The Raja\nwas ever repeating the names, Yajne\xc5\x9ba, Achyuta, Govinda, Madhava, Ananta,\nKe\xc5\x9bava, Krishn\xcc\x81a, Vishn\xcc\x81u, Hrishike\xc5\x9ba; nothing else did be utter, even in his\ndreams; nor upon anything but those names, and their import, did he ever\nmeditate. He accepted fuel, flowers, and holy grass, for the worship of the\ndeity, but\n\np. 244\n\nperformed no other religious rites, being engrossed by disinterested, abstract\ndevotion.\n\nOn one occasion he went to the Mahanadi 3, for the purpose of ablution: he\nbathed there, and performed the ceremonies usual after bathing, Whilst thus\noccupied, there came to the same place a doe big with young, who had come out\nof the forest to drink of the stream. Whilst quenching her thirst, there was\nheard on a sudden the loud and fearful roaring of a lion; on which the doe,\nbeing excessively alarmed, jumped out of the water upon the bank. In\nconsequence of this great leap, her fawn was suddenly brought forth, and fell\ninto the river; and the king, seeing it carried away by the current, caught\nhold of the young animal, and saved it from being drowned. The injury received\nby the deer, by her violent exertion, proved fatal, and she lay down, and\ndied; which being observed by the royal ascetic, he took the fawn in his arms,\nand returned with it to his hermitage: there he fed it and tended it every\nday, and it throve and grew up under his care. It frolicked about the cell,\nand grazed upon the grass in its vicinity; and whenever it strayed to a\ndistance, and was alarmed at a wild beast, it ran back thither for safety.\nEvery morning it sallied forth from home, and every evening returned to the\nthatched shelter of the leafy bower of Bharata.\n\nWhilst the deer was thus the inmate of his hermitage, the mind of the king was\never anxious about the animal, now wandering away, and now returning to his\nside, and he was unable to think of anything else. He had relinquished his\nkingdom, his children, all his friends, and now indulged in selfish affection\nfor a fawn. When absent for a longer time than ordinary, he would fancy that\nit had been carried off by wolves, devoured by a tiger, or slain by a lion.\n"The earth," he would exclaim, "is embrowned by the impressions of its hoofs.\nWhat has become of the young deer, that was born for my delight? How happy I\nshould be\n\np. 245\n\nif he had returned from the thicket, and I felt his budding antlers rubbing\nagainst my arm. These tufts of sacred grass, of which the heads have been\nnibbled by his new teeth, look like pious lads chanting the Sama-veda 4." Thus\nthe Muni meditated whenever the deer was long absent from him; and\ncontemplated him with a countenance animated with pleasure as he stood by his\nside. His abstraction was interrupted, the spirit of the king being engrossed\nby the fawn, even though he had abandoned family, wealth, and dominion. The\nfirmness of the prince\'s mind became unsteady, and wandered with the\nwanderings of the young deer. In the course of time the king became subject to\nits influence. He died, watched by the deer, with tears in its eyes, like a\nson mourning for his father; and he himself, as he expired, cast his eyes upon\nthe animal, and thought of nothing else, being wholly occupied with one idea.\n\nIn consequence of this predominant feeling at such a season, he was born\nagain, in the Jambumarga forests, as a deer 5, with the faculty of\nrecollecting his former life; which recollection inspiring a distaste for the\nworld, he left his mother, and again repaired to the holy place \xc5\x9aalagrama.\nSubsisting there upon dry grass and leaves, he atoned for the acts which had\nled to his being born in such a condition; and upon his death he was next born\nas a Brahman, still retaining the memory of his prior existence. He was born\nin a pious and eminent family of ascetics, who were rigid observers of\ndevotional rites. Possessed of all true wisdom, and acquainted with the\nessence of all sacred writings, he beheld soul as contradistinguished from\nmatter (Prakriti). Embued with knowledge of self, he beheld the gods and all\nother beings as in reality the same. It did not happen to him to undergo\ninvestiture with the Brahmanical thread, nor to read the Vedas with a\nspiritual preceptor, nor to perform ceremonies, nor to study the scriptures.\nWhenever spoken to, he replied incoherently and in ungrammatical and\nunpolished\n\np. 246\n\nspeech. His person was unclean, and he was clad in dirty garments. Saliva\ndribbled from his mouth, and he was treated with contempt by all the people.\nRegard for the consideration of the world is fatal to the success of devotion.\nThe ascetic who is despised of men attains the end of his abstractions. Let\ntherefore a holy man pursue the path of the righteous, without murmuring; and\nthough men contemn him, avoid association with mankind. This, the counsel of\nHiran\xcc\x81yagarbha 6, did the Brahman call to mind, and hence assumed the\nappearance of a crazy ideot in the eyes of the world. His food was raw pulse,\npotherbs, wild fruit, and grains of corn. Whatever came in his way he ate, as\npart of a necessary, but temporary infliction 7. Upon his father\'s death he\nwas set to work in the fields by his brothers and his nephews, and fed by them\nwith vile food; and as he was firm and stout of make, and a simpleton in\noutward act, he was the slave of every one that chose to employ him, receiving\nsustenance alone for his hire.\n\nThe head servant of the king of Sauvira, looking upon him as an indolent,\nuntaught Brahman, thought him a fit person to work without pay (and took him\ninto his master\'s service to assist in carrying the palankin.)\n\nThe king having ascended his litter, on one occasion, was proceeding to the\nhermitage of Kapila, on the banks of the Ikshumati river 8, to consult the\nsage, to whom the virtues leading to liberation were known, what was most\ndesirable in a world abounding with care and sorrow. Amongst those who by\norder of his head servant had been compelled gratuitously to carry the litter\nwas the Brahman, who had been equally pressed into this duty, and who, endowed\nwith the only universal knowledge, and remembering his former existence, bore\nthe burden as the means of expiating the faults for which he was desirous to\natone. Fixing his eyes upon the pole, he went tardily along, whilst the other\n\np. 247\n\nbearers moved with alacrity; and the king, feeling the litter carried\nunevenly, called out, "Ho bearers! what is this? Keep equal pace together."\nStill it proceeded unsteadily, and the Raja again exclaimed, "What is this?\nhow irregularly are you going!" When this had repeatedly occurred, the\npalankin-bearers at last replied to the king, "It is this man, who lags in his\npace." "How is this?" said the prince to the Brahman, "are you weary? You have\ncarried your burden but a little way; are you unable to bear fatigue? and yet\nyou look robust." The Brahman answered and said, "It is not _I_ who am robust,\nnor is it by me that your palankin is carried. _I_ am not wearied, prince, nor\nam _I_ incapable of fatigue." The king replied, "I clearly see that you are\nstout, and that the palankin is borne by you; and the carriage of a burden is\nwearisome to all persons." "First tell me," said the Brahman, "what it is of\nme that you have clearly seen 9, and then you may distinguish my properties as\nstrong or weak. The assertion that you behold the palankin borne by me, or\nplaced on me, is untrue. Listen, prince, to what I have to remark. The place\nof both the feet is the ground; the legs are supported by the feet; the thighs\nrest upon the legs; and the belly reposes on the thighs; the chest is\nsupported by the belly; and the arms and shoulders are propped up by the\nchest: the palankin is borne upon the shoulders, and how can it be considered\nas my burden? This body which is seated in the palankin is defined as Thou;\nthence what is elsewhere called This, is here distinguished as I and Thou. I\nand thou and others are constructed of the elements; and the elements,\nfollowing the stream of qualities, assume a bodily shape; but qualities, such\nas goodness and the rest, are dependant upon acts; and acts, accumulated in\nignorance, influence the condition of all beings 10. The pure, imperishable\nsoul, tranquil, void of qualities, preeminent over nature (Prakriti), is one,\nwithout increase or diminution, in all bodies. But if it be equally exempt\nfrom increase or diminution, then with what propriety\n\np. 248\n\ncan you say to me, \'I see that thou art robust?\' If the palankin rests on the\nshoulders, and they on the body; the body on the feet, and the feet on the\nearth; then is the burden borne as much by you as by me 11. When the nature of\nmen is different, either in its essence or its cause, then may it be said that\nfatigue is to be undergone by me. That which is the substance of the palankin\nis the substance of you and me and all others, being an aggregate of elements,\naggregated by individuality."\n\nHaving thus spoken, the Brahman was silent, and went on bearing the palankin;\nbut the king leaped out of it, and hastened to prostrate himself at his feet;\nsaying, "Have compassion on me, Brahman, and cast aside the palankin; and tell\nme who thou art, thus disguised under the appearance of a fool." The Brahman\nanswered and said, "Hear me, Raja,. Who I am it is not possible to say:\narrival at any place is for the sake of fruition; and enjoyment of pleasure,\nor endurance of pain, is the cause of the production of the body. A living\nbeing assumes a corporeal form to reap the results of virtue or vice. The\nuniversal cause of all living creatures is virtue or vice: why therefore\ninquire the cause (of my being the person I appear)." The king said,\n"Undoubtedly virtue and vice are the causes of all existent effects, and\nmigration into several bodies is for the purpose of receiving their\nconsequences; but with respect to what you have asserted, that it is not\npossible for you to tell me who you are, that is a matter which I am desirous\nto hear explained. How can it be impossible, Brahman, for any one to declare\nhimself to be that which he is? There can be no detriment to one\'s-self from\napplying to it the word _I_." The Brahman said, "It is true that there is no\nwrong done to that which is one\'s-self by the application to it of the word\n_I_ ; but the term is characteristic of error, of conceiving that to be the\nself (or soul) which is not self or soul. The tongue articulates the word _I_\n, aided by the lips, the teeth, and the palate; and these are the origin of\nthe expression, as they are the causes of the production of speech. If by\nthese instruments speech is able to utter the word _I_ , it is nevertheless\n\np. 249\n\nimproper to assert that speech itself is _I_  12. The body of a man,\ncharacterized by hands, feet, and the like, is made up of various parts; to\nwhich of these can I properly apply the denomination _I_? If another being is\ndifferent specifically from me, most excellent monarch, then it may be said\nthat _this_ is I; _that_ is the other: but when one only soul is dispersed in\nall bodies, it is then idle to say, Who are you? who am I? Thou art a king;\nthis is a palankin; these are the bearers; these the running footmen; this is\nthy retinue: yet it is untrue that all these are said to be thine. The\npalankin on which thou sittest is made of timber derived from a tree. What\nthen? is it denominated either timber or a tree? People do not say that the\nking is perched upon a tree, nor that he is seated upon a piece of wood, when\nyou have mounted your palankin. The vehicle is an assemblage of pieces of\ntimber, artificially joined together: judge, prince, for yourself in what the\npalankin differs really from the wood. Again; contemplate the sticks of the\numbrella, in their separate state. Where then is the umbrella? Apply this\nreasoning to thee and to me 13. A man, a woman, a cow, a goat, a horse, an\nelephant, a bird, a tree, are names assigned to various bodies, which are the\nconsequences of acts. Man 14 is neither a god, nor a man, nor a brute, nor a\ntree; these are mere varieties of shape, the effects of acts. The thing which\nin the world is called a king, the servant of a king, or by any other\nappellation, is not a reality; it is the creature of our imaginations: for\nwhat is there in the world, that is subject to vicissitude, that does not in\nthe course of time go by different names. Thou art called the monarch of the\nworld; the son of thy father; the enemy\n\np. 250\n\nof thy foes; the husband of thy wife; the father of thy children. What shall I\ndenominate thee? How art thou situated? Art thou the head or the belly? or are\nthey thine? Art thou the feet? or do they belong to thee? Thou art, oh king,\ndistinct in thy nature from all thy members! Now then, rightly understanding\nthe question, think who I am; and how it is possible for me, after the truth\nis ascertained (of the identity of all), to recognise any distinction, or to\nspeak of my own individuality by the expression _I_.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[243:1](vp071.htm#fr_726) One copy addresses Para\xc5\x9bara, Bhagavan sarvabhutesa,\n\'Sacred sovereign, lord of all creatures;\' rather an unusual title for a sage,\neven though an inspired one.

It may be here\nnoticed that \xc5\x9aalagrama is named amongst the Tirthas in the Mahabharata: see\n[p. 163](vp058.htm#page_163).\n\n[245:4](vp071.htm#fr_729) The applicability of this simile is not explained by\nthe commentator: it refers possibly to the cropped or shaven heads of the\nreligious students.\n\n[245:5](vp071.htm#fr_730) According to the Bhagavata, Jambumarga is the\nKalanjara mountain or Kalanjar in Bundelkhand.\n\n[246:6](vp071.htm#fr_731) Hiran\xcc\x81yagarbha or Brahma is named here instead of\nthe Yoga doctrine, which is sometimes ascribed to him as its author.\n\n[246:7](vp071.htm#fr_732) As a Kala sanyama, a state of suffering or\nmortification lasting only for a season; or, in other words, bodily existence;\nthe body being contemplated as a sore, for which food is the unguent; drink,\nthe lotion; and dress, the bandage.\n\n[246:8](vp071.htm#fr_733) A river in the north of India.\n\n[247:9](vp071.htm#fr_734) That is, What have you discerned of me, my body,\nlife, or soul?\n\n[247:10](vp071.htm#fr_735) The condition--that is, the personal individuality\n--of any one is the consequence of his acts; but the same living principle\nanimates him which is common to all living things.\n\n[248:11](vp071.htm#fr_736) The body is not the individual; therefore it is not\nthe individual, but the body, or eventually the earth, which bears the burden.\n\n[249:12](vp071.htm#fr_737) That is, speech, or any or all of the faculties or\nsenses, is not soul.\n\n[249:13](vp071.htm#fr_738) The aggregate limbs and senses no more constitute\nthe individual, than the accidental combination of certain pieces of wood\nmakes the fabric anything else than wood: in like manner as the machine is\nstill timber, so the body is still mere elementary matter. Again; the senses\nand limbs, considered separately, no more constitute the man, than each\nindividual stick constitutes the umbrella. Whether separate or conjoined,\ntherefore, the parts of the body are mere matter; and as matter does not make\nup man, they do not constitute an individual.\n\n[249:14](vp071.htm#fr_739) T\xcc\x81he term in this and the preceding clause is\nPuman; here used generically, there specifically.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIV](vp072.htm)\n\n'
