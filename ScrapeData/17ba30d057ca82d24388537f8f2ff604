Tell me the means by which this knowledge is acquired. I\n(wish to) learn from you the source from which that knowledge proceeds.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said\n\nKnow that he who devotes himself to the Brahman is the (lower) Arani, the\ninstructor is the upper Arani. Penance and sacred learning cause the attrition\n2, and from that the fire of knowledge is produced.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a's wife said:\n\nAs to this symbol of the Brahman which is denominated the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a,\nwhere, indeed, is (to be found) a description of it, by which it 3 is capable\nof being comprehended?\n\np. 309\n\nThe Brahmana said:\n\nHe is without symbols 1, and also without qualities; nothing exists that is a\ncause of him. I will only state the means by which he can be comprehended or\nnot. A good means is found, namely, action 2 and knowledge, by which that 3\n(entity), which has the symbols (useful) for knowledge 4 attributed to it\nthrough ignorance, is perceived as by bees 5. In the (rules for) final\nemancipation, it is not laid down, that a certain thing should be done, and a\ncertain thing should not 6. But the knowledge of the things beneficial to the\nself is produced in one who sees and hears 7. One should adopt as many of\nthese things, (which are) means of direct perception, as may here be\npracticable--unperceived, and those whose form is perceived 8, in hundreds and\nin thousands, all of various descriptions. Then one reaches near that beyond\nwhich nothing exists.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nThen the mind of the Brahma _n_ a's wife, after the\n\np. 310\n\ndestruction of the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a [1](sbe0847.htm#fn_1482), turned to that\nwhich is beyond (all) Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1as by means of a knowledge of the Kshetra\n[2](sbe0847.htm#fn_1483).\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nWhere, indeed, O K _ri_ sh _n_ a! is that Brahma _n_ a's wife, and where is\nthat chief of Brahma _n_ as, by both of whom this perfection was attained?\nTell me about them both, O undegraded one!\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nKnow my mind to be the Brahma _n_ a, and know my understanding to be the\nBrahmana's wife. And he, O Dhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya! who has been spoken of as the\nKshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a, is I myself [3](sbe0847.htm#fn_1484).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[308:1](sbe0846.htm#fr_1476) I. e. mind, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[308:2](sbe0846.htm#fr_1477) Scil. of the Ara _n_ is (i. e. the wood used for\nkindling fire); the sense is, that the pupil who has penance and Vedic\nlearning goes to a teacher for knowledge. See _S_ veta _s_ vatara pp. 307,\n308.\n\n[308:3](sbe0846.htm#fr_1478) I. e. the Brahman, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, of\nwhich the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a is only a symbol. For a definition of Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a,\nsee _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 187, st. 23.\n\n[309:1](sbe0846.htm#fr_1479) See Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p.\n160](sbe0823.htm#page_160).\n\n[309:2](sbe0846.htm#fr_1480) Viz. that which is required as a preliminary to\nthe acquisition of knowledge, and hence is necessary for final emancipation.\n\n[309:3](sbe0846.htm#fr_1481) The Brahman.\n\n[309:4](sbe0846.htm#fr_1482) I. e. symbols which are to convey a knowledge of\nthe Brahman.\n\n[309:5](sbe0846.htm#fr_1483) I. e. in a way not perfect; as bees hovering\nabove a flower get the fragrance of it without grasping the flower itself, so\nthese means give one an imperfect knowledge of the Brahman to be afterwards\nperfected by constant meditation upon it (nididhyasa).\n\n[309:6](sbe0846.htm#fr_1484) As it is in the prior portion of the Vedas, as to\nsacrifices, &c.\n\n[309:7](sbe0846.htm#fr_1485) Sees, i. e. by contemplation; hears, i. e. from a\nteacher, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[309:8](sbe0846.htm#fr_1486) This seems to mean such things as hearing,\nreading, &c., which would be 'perceived' scil. by the senses; and all\nintellectual operations which would be 'unperceived.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XX](sbe0847.htm)\n\n"
