He (breath) is likewise a Bibhradvaga (bringer of offspring). Offspring is\nva _g_ a, and he (breath) supports offspring. Because he supports it,\ntherefore there is (the poet of the sixth Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the Rig-veda,\ncalled) Bharadvaga. Therefore people call him who is really Pra _n_ a\n(breath), Bharadvaga.\n\n2\\. The Devas (speech, &c.) said to him: 'He it is who chiefly causes us to\ndwell on earth.' Because the Devas said of him, that he chiefly caused them to\ndwell on earth, therefore there is (the poet of the seventh Ma _n_ _d_ ala of\nthe Rig-veda, called) Vasish _th_ a. Therefore people call him who is really\nPra _n_ a (breath), Vasish _th_ a 1.\n\n3\\. He (breath) went forth towards 2 all this whatsoever. Because he went\nforth toward all this whatsoever, therefore there are (the poets of the eighth\nMa _n_ _d_ ala of the Rig-veda, called) the Pragathas. Therefore people call\nhim who is really Pra _n_ a (breath), the Pragathas.\n\n4\\. He (breath) purified all this whatsoever. Because he purified all this\nwhatsoever, therefore there\n\np. 217\n\nare (the hymns and also the poets 1 of the ninth Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the Rig-\nveda, called) the Pavamanis. Therefore people called him who is really Pra _n_\na (breath), the Pavamanis.\n\n5\\. He (breath) said: 'Let me be everything whatsoever, small (kshudra) and\ngreat (mahat), and this became the Kshudrasuktas and Mahasuktas.' Therefore\nthere were (the hymns and also the poets of the tenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala of the\nRig-veda, called) the Kshudrasuktas (and Mahasuktas). Therefore people call\nhim who is really Pra _n_ a (breath), the Kshudrasuktas (and Mahasuktas).\n\n6\\. He (breath) said once: 'You have said what is well said (su-ukta) indeed.\nThis became a Sukta (hymn).' Therefore there was the Sukta. Therefore people\ncall him who is really Pra _n_ a (breath), Sukta 2.\n\n7\\. He (breath) is a _Ri_ _k_ (verse), for he did honour 3 to all beings (by\nentering into them). Because he did honour to all beings, therefore there was\nthe _Ri_ _k_ verse. Therefore people call him who is really Pra _n_ a\n(breath), _Ri_ _k_.\n\n8\\. He (breath) is an Ardhar _k_ a (half-verse), for he did honour to all\nplaces (ardha) 4. Because he did honour to all places, therefore there was the\nArdhar _k_ a. Therefore people call him who is really Pra _n_ a (breath),\nArdhar _k_ a.\n\np. 218\n\n9\\. He (breath) is a Pada (word) 1, for he got into all these beings. Because\nhe got (padi) into all these beings, therefore there was the Pada (word).\nTherefore people call him who is really Pra _n_ a (breath), Pada.\n\n10\\. He (breath) is an Akshara (syllable), for he pours out (ksharati) gifts\nto all these beings, and without him no one can pour out (atiksharati) gifts.\nTherefore there was the Akshara (syllable). Therefore people call him who is\nreally Pra _n_ a (breath), Akshara 2.\n\n11\\. Thus all these _Ri_ _k_ verses, all Vedas, all sounds 3 are one word,\nviz. Pra _n_ a (breath). Let him know that Pra _n_ a is all _Ri_ _k_ verses.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[216:1](sbe01211.htm#fr_530) I translate in accordance with the commentator,\nand probably with the intention of the author. The same etymology is repeated\nin the commentary on II, 2, 4, 2. It would be more natural to take vasish _th_\na in the sense of the richest.\n\n[216:2](sbe01211.htm#fr_531) This is the interpretation of the commentator,\nand the preposition abhi seems to show that the author too took that view of\nthe etymology of pragatha.\n\n[217:1](sbe01211.htm#fr_532) It seems, indeed, as if in the technical language\nof the Brahmans, the poets of the ninth Ma _n_ _d_ ala were sometimes called\nPavamanis, and the hymns of the tenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala Kshudrasuktas and\nMahasuktas (masc.) Cf. \xc3\x82rsheya-brahma _n_ a, ed. Burnell, p. 42.\n\n[217:2](sbe01211.htm#fr_533) The poet also is called Sukta, taddrash _t_ api\nsuktanamako 'bhut. Comm.\n\n[217:3](sbe01211.htm#fr_534) I translate according to the commentator.\n\n[217:4](sbe01211.htm#fr_535) Ardha means both half and place.\n\n[218:1](sbe01211.htm#fr_536) It may also be intended for pada, foot of a\nverse.\n\n[218:2](sbe01211.htm#fr_537) The Pra _n_ a (breath) is to be meditated on as\nall hymns, all poets, all words, &c. Comm.\n\n[218:3](sbe01211.htm#fr_538) All aspirated sonant consonants. Comm.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 3](sbe01212.htm)\n\n"
