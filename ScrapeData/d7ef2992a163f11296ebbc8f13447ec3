And the Soul, lying on a housetop on the Earth,\nand [looking](errata.htm#6) forth into the uttermost of space, realised the\nsolitude and trembled.\n\nThen came one whose voice spake within the heart, saying very gently, "Come\nthou away into that quiet place and rest awhile. There it may be that thou\nshalt speak with Him." And that soul arose, following after, as it were, the\nAngel of the Presence,--who bore white lilies, and about his feet played\nflames, and his eyes to look into were like mighty waters--and carne by many\nways unto the Lord\'s own garden, and rested there.\n\nAnd there was in that garden a place where five trees grew together, beneath\nwhich oftentimes had the Master sat and prayed and entered into glory. Thither\nwent the soul, laden with sorrowful queries and needs, and being received into\nthe silence, waited.\n\nOn the left flowed the river, and the great barges went past swiftly,\n\np. 94\n\nwith sails full set. Beneath, the dead leaves stirred in the breeze, or\nrustled under the footsteps of a mouse. And on the branches above fell the\nflood of moonlight, dropping through and making spaces on the brickwork, all\noutlined by quivering leaves and moving stems.\n\nThe whispers of river and trees and lone night-creatures were the only sounds\nthat could be heard.\n\n.      .      .      .      .      .\n\n"Those with whom I was wont to come, O Master, are absent now. In far distant\nand separate lands think they upon this place. I would make memorial for them\nat Thy feet to-night!"\n\nAnd the Lord said--"It is well. My own are ever Mine. I bear their burdens; I\nguide their footsteps; and at last I bring them to that haven where they would\nbe. There are three here to-night, My child, not one. Be assured."\n\n\n\n"Some whom we love, O Lord, are in fetters of suffering. With hearts cramped\nby fear they look\n\np. 95\n\nout upon their world. One longs for death because life is bitter: to others,\nlife comes so hard that we almost ask for death for them. We pray Thee, give\nthese ease, or that light that makes ease of no account."\n\nAnd the Lord, smiling, listened--\n\n"It cannot be, O Lord, that for the People we can do nothing! In the midst of\nterrible calamity, shrinking from the gaze of death, or striving against the\nblow that will rob them of the beloved: sleeping hard in the air of poisonous\nswamps, ill-fed, ignorant, and oppressed, it cannot be that we, so much more\nfortunate, can share nothing with them. It cannot be that Thou wilt tell us it\nis vain to struggle.\n\n\n\n"And what would you have?"\n\n"Only the right to share their danger, if nothing can be done. Only to hold\ntheir hands and hearten them--to perform some menial service for them--not to\nfeel utterly cut off from fellowship, while they tread the winepress of\ndespair!"\n\np. 96\n\n"Is this all?"\n\n"Nay, if it were granted to us to serve truly--that would be blessedness. If\nwe might indeed bring help, then the cup were full. But even without this we\npray to be allowed the freedom where men do what they can, without thought o\nself. Command us not forever to think of the necessities of life. Grant us to\ngive, and leave with Thee, and remember not whether life or death we shall\ntake away."\n\n\n\nAnd there was long silence. And at last the Voice, very gentle and\nreproachful--\n\n"O foolish Children! Have ye yet to learn that this love that speaks in your\nhearts is not yours but Mine? Must ye struggle and plead with me for My own?\nKnow ye not that difficulties and discouragements but point out the way in\nwhich I would guide you? Strive on and fear not! That way shall be found! Can\n_My_ love be baffled? . . . Is yours more than its feeblest utterance?\nRemember\n\np. 97\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--\'Thy right is only to action: thy right is never to\nthe fruit thereof.\' Maybe this struggle is itself your action. Yours not to\nask how it shall end . . . . Your love is not separate from Mine. Know that\nthese two are one . . . ."\n\nAnd as the words died away, those souls rested for a moment in the sight of a\nUniverse that was all Mother--of a love of which the love of human mothers for\ntheir children is but a feeble glimmer--of a life that whether hard or happy-\nseeming, was all alike the dealing of that Universe-Mother with Her babes.\n\n.      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .\n\n\n\nAnd the Master put forth His hand in that place and blessed His worshippers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: An Intercession](ktm07.htm)\n\n'
