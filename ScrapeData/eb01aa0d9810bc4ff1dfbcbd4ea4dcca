Once on a time the gods deposited with Agni all their beasts, both\ndomestic and wild; either because they were about to engage in battle or from\na desire of free scope, or because they thought that he (Agni) would protect\nthem as the best protector.\n\n2:3:4:22\\. Now Agni coveted them, and seizing them he entered the night with\nthem. 'Let us go back thither,' said the gods, and betook themselves to where\nAgni was concealed. Now they knew that he had entered there, that he had\nentered the night; and when the night returned in the evening, they approached\nhim and said, 'Give us our beasts! give us back our beasts!' Agni then gave\nthem back their beasts.\n\n2:3:4:33\\. For this then let him respectfully approach the two fires: the\nfires are givers, and thereby he supplicates them. Let him approach them in\nthe evening, for in the evening the gods approached (Agni). And whosoever,\nknowing this, approaches (the two fires), to him, indeed, they grant cattle.\n\n2:3:4:44\\. Then as to why he should not approach them. Now in the beginning\nboth the gods and men were together here. And whatever did not belong to the\nmen, for that they importuned the gods, saying, 'This is not ours: let it be\nours!' Being indignant\n\np. 348\n\nat this importunity, the gods then disappeared. Hence (it may be argued) one\nshould not approach (the fires), fearing lest he should offend them, lest he\nshould become hateful to them.\n\n2:3:4:55\\. Then as to why he should nevertheless approach (the fires). The\nsacrifice, assuredly, belongs to the gods, and the prayer for blessing to the\nsacrificer. Now the (Agnihotra) libation, doubtless, is the same as the\nsacrifice; and what he does 1 in now approaching (the fires), that indeed is\nthe sacrificer's prayer for blessing.\n\n2:3:4:66\\. And again, why he should not approach (the fires). Whosoever\nfollows either a Brahman or Kshatriya, praising him, thinking, 'He will give\nme gifts, he will build me a house,' to him, if he strives to please him both\nin speech and deed, that (master of his) will think himself bound to give\ngifts. Whosoever, on the other hand, says, 'What art thou to me, that givest\nme nothing?' him that (master) is likely to hate, to become disgusted with.\nHence one should not approach (the fire); for by kindling and offering in it,\nhe already supplicates it, and he should not therefore approach (and importune\nit again).\n\n2:3:4:77\\. And again, why he should nevertheless approach (the fires). He\nalone that asks finds a giver; and the master, moreover, knows nothing of his\ndependent. But when the latter says, 'I am thy dependent: support me!' then he\ndoes know him, and feels himself bound to support him. Let him therefore\napproach (the fires). This then is the\n\np. 349\n\nwhole (argument) as to why one should approach (the fires).\n\n2:3:4:88\\. Now that (fire) being Pra _g_ apati,--when the Agnihotra is\noffered, he casts the seed of all that he rules over, of all that is after his\nmanner: and by approaching (the fire) one imitates (him in) all this, one\nreproduces all this 1.\n\n2:3:4:99\\. He begins to pray 2 with the verse (Va _g_. S. III, 11) containing\nthe word 'upon (upa).' Now the word 'upon' means this (earth), and that in a\ntwofold way: for whatever is produced here, that is produced upon (upa- _g_\nan) this (earth); and whatever decays, that is buried (upa-vap 3) in this\n(earth): hence there is here imperishable, ever-increasing abundance, and with\nthat imperishable abundance he begins.\n\n2:3:4:1010\\. He prays, 'Entering upon the worship--,' worship (adhvara)\ndoubtless means sacrifice: 'entering upon the sacrifice' is what he means to\nsay. '--Let us offer prayer to Agni--,' for he is indeed about to offer prayer\nto him; '--to him who hears us even from afar!' thereby he means to say,\n'Although thou art afar from us, yet do thou hear this our (prayer), do thou\nso far think well of it!'\n\n2:3:4:1111\\. [He continues, Va _g_. S. III, 12], 'Agni, the head,\n\np. 350\n\nthe summit of the sky; he, the lord of the earth, animates the seeds of the\nwaters.' He thereby follows (and praises) him:--even as a supplicant would\nspeak politely, 'Surely thou art the descendant of so and so! surely thou art\nable to do this!' so (he does) by this (verse).\n\n2:3:4:1212\\. Thereupon the verse to Indra and Agni (Va _g_. S. III, 13), 'You\ntwo, O Indra and Agni, I will invoke; you two I will delight together with\nkindly office; you two, the givers of strength and wealth,--you two I invoke\nfor the obtainment of strength!' Indra, doubtless, is the same as that burning\n(sun); when he sets, then he enters the \xc3\x82havaniya;--hence he now approaches\nthese two that are thus united, thinking, 'May the two, united, grant me\nfavours:' this is why the Indra-Agni (verse is muttered).\n\n2:3:4:1313\\. [He continues, ib. 14 seq.], 'This is thy natural womb, whence\nborn thou shonest forth: knowing this, arise, O Agni, and increase our\nsubstance!'--substance, doubtless, means affluence: 'grant to us ever-\nincreasing affluence!' is what he thereby says.\n\n2:3:4:1414\\. 'First was he founded by the founders here, the best offering\npriest, worthy of praise at the sacrifices; he whom Apnavana and the Bh _ri_\ngus kindled 1, shining brightly in the wood, and spreading from house to\nhouse:'--even as a supplicant would speak politely, 'Surely thou art the\ndescendant of so and so! surely thou art able to do this!' so in this (verse).\nAnd what he (Agni) really is, as such he speaks of him when he says 'spreading\nfrom house to house,' for he does indeed spread from house to house.\n\np. 351\n\n2:3:4:1515\\. 'In accordance with his old (pratna) splendour, the dauntless\nhave milked the shining juice from the wise one that giveth a hundredfold.'\nThe richest of gifts, indeed, is the hundredfold gift; and in order to obtain\nthat (giver) he says, 'the wise one that giveth a hundredfold.'\n\n2:3:4:1616\\. This is a hymn of six verses collected (from the _Ri_ k); the\nfirst of them containing (the word) 'upon,' and the last containing (the word)\n'old' (pratna). And this we recited, because she (the earth) is the one that\ncontains the (word) 'upon;' and that which is 'old' doubtless is yonder (sky),\nfor as many gods as there were 'of old,' in the beginning, so many gods there\nare now, and hence the 'old' means yonder (sky). Now within these two (worlds)\nall desires are contained; and these two are in accord with each other for his\n(the sacrificer's) benefit, and concede all his wishes.\n\n2:3:4:1717\\. Thrice he mutters the first (verse) and thrice the last; for of\nthreefold beginning are sacrifices, and of threefold termination: therefore he\nmutters thrice the first and the last (verses).\n\n2:3:4:1818\\. Now, in offering the Agnihotra, whatever mistake one commits,\neither in word or deed, thereby he injures either his own body, or his life,\nor his vigour, or his offspring.\n\n2:3:4:1919\\. Accordingly (he mutters the texts, V. S. III, 17), 'Thou, O Agni,\nart the protector of bodies: protect my body! Thou, O Agni, art the giver of\nlife: give me life! Thou, O Agni, art the giver of vigour: give me vigour! O\nAgni, what defect there is in my body, supply that for me!'\n\n2:3:4:2020\\. And whatever mistake he commits, in offering the Agnihotra,\neither in word or deed, thereby he\n\np. 352\n\ninjures either his own body, or his life, or his vigour, or his offspring:\n'make that up for me!' he thereby says; and accordingly that (defect) is again\nmade up for him.\n\n2:3:4:2121\\. [He continues, Va _g_. S. III, 18], 'Kindled, we enkindle thee,\nthe brilliant one, a hundred winters--;' he thereby says, 'may we live a\nhundred years;' and 'so long we enkindle thee, the great one,' he says, when\nhe says 'we enkindle thee, the brilliant one.' '--We, the vigorous--thee, the\ninvigorating; we, the strong--thee, the giver of strength--;' whereby he says,\n'may we be vigorous, mayest thou be invigorating! may we be strong, mayest\nthou be a giver of strength!' '--We, the uninjured--thee, the uninjurable\ninjurer of enemies!' whereby he says, 'by thine aid may we render our enemies\nutterly miserable!'\n\n2:3:4:2222\\. 'O thou, rich in lights, may I safely reach thine end!' this he\nmutters thrice. She that is rich in lights ( _k_ itravasu) doubtless is the\nnight, since the latter, as it were, rests (vas) after gathering together the\nlights ( _k_ itra): hence (at night) one does not see clearly ( _k_ itram)\nfrom afar.\n\n2:3:4:2323\\. Now it was by means of this same (text) that the _Ri_ shis\nreached safely the end of the night; and because of it the evil spirits, the\nRakshas, did not find them: by it, therefore, he also now reaches safely the\nend of the night; and because of it the evil spirits, the Rakshas, find him\nnot.--This much he mutters while standing.\n\n2:3:4:2424\\. Thereupon, while seated, (he mutters, Va _g_. S. III, 19 seq.),\n'Thou, O Agni, hast attained to Surya's lustre--;' this he says, because, in\nsetting, the sun enters the \xc3\x82havaniya; '--to the praise\n\np. 353\n\nof the _Ri_ shis--;' this he says, because he himself now approaches (and\nworships, praises, the fire); '--to the favourite abode (or dainty);' his\n(Agni's) favourite abode doubtless are the offerings: 'to offerings' he\nthereby says. '--May I attain to long life, to lustre, to offspring, to\nincrease of wealth!' whereby he says, 'Even as thou didst attain to those\n(qualities), so may I attain to long life, lustre, offspring, affluence,--that\nis to say, to prosperity.'\n\n2:3:4:2525\\. He then approaches the cow 1, with the text (Va _g_. S. III, 20),\n'Food ye are: may I enjoy your food! wealth ye are: may I enjoy your wealth!'\n--whereby he means to say, 'whatever energies are yours, whatever riches are\nyours, may I enjoy them.'--'Strength ye are: may I enjoy your strength!'\nwhereby he says, 'sap ye are: may I enjoy your sap!'--'Affluence ye are: may I\nenjoy your affluence!' whereby he says, 'abundance ye are: may I enjoy your\nabundance!'\n\n2:3:4:2626\\. 'Ye prosperous ones, disport yourselves--;' cattle are\nprosperous: therefore he says, 'ye prosperous ones, disport yourselves--;' '--\nin this seat, in this fold, in this place, in this homestead: remain here, go\nnot from hence!' this he says with reference to himself,--'go not away from\nme!'\n\n2:3:4:2727\\. He then touches the cow, with the text (Va _g_. S. III, 22 a),\n'Motley thou art, of all shapes;'--for cattle are indeed of all shapes:\ntherefore he calls her all-shaped; '--come to me with sap and possession of\ncattle!' when he says 'with sap,' he means\n\np. 354\n\nto say 'with juice;' and when he says with possession of cattle,' he means to\nsay 'with abundance.'\n\n2:3:4:2828\\. He then steps up to the Garhapatya, and renders homage to it,\nwith the text (ib. 22 b), 'Thee, O Agni, illuminer of the night 1, we approach\nday by day with prayer, paying homage unto thee.' He thus renders homage to it\nin order that it may not injure him.\n\n2:3:4:2929\\. [He continues, ib. 23 seq.], 'Thee that rulest over the\nsacrifices, the brilliant guardian of the sacred rite, thriving in thine own\nhouse;'--whereby he means to say, 'thine own house is this (house) of mine:\nmake it ever more flourishing for us!'\n\n2:3:4:3030\\. 'O Agni, be thou accessible unto us, even as a father is to his\nson! lead us unto well-being!'--whereby he says, 'As a father is easy of\naccess to his son, and the latter in no wise injures him, so be thou easy of\naccess to us, and may we in no wise injure thee!'\n\n2:3:4:3131\\. Then the dvipada verses (Va _g_. S. III, 25, 26), 'O Agni, be\never nigh unto us, a kindly guardian and protector! as wealthy Agni, famed for\nwealth, come hither and bestow on us glorious riches! Thee, the most bright\nand resplendent, we now approach for happiness to our friends: be with us,\nhear our call, and keep us safe from every evil-doer!'\n\n2:3:4:3232\\. Now when he approaches the \xc3\x82havaniya, he prays for cattle: he\ntherefore approaches it with metres great and small, since cattle are of great\nand small size. And when he approaches the Garhapatya,\n\np. 355\n\nhe prays for men: hence the first tristich is in the gayatri metre, since the\ngayatri is Agni's metre, and he thus approaches him with his own metre.\n\n2:3:4:3333\\. Thereupon (he mutters) the dvipada (two-footed) verses. The\ndvipada, doubtless, is man's metre, since man is two-footed, and men are\ntherewith prayed for: and as he now prays for men, therefore (he uses) dvipada\nverses. And whosoever, knowing this, approaches (the two fires), becomes\npossessed both of cattle and men.\n\n2:3:4:3434\\. He then goes (again) to the cow, with the text (Va _g_. S. III,\n27), 'O I _d_ a, come hither! O Aditi, come hither!' for both I _d_ a and\nAditi are cows. He touches her with, 'Come hither, ye much-desired!'--for\nmen's wishes are fixed on them, and hence he says, 'come hither, ye much-\ndesired;'--'Let there be for me the fulfilment of wishes from you!' whereby he\nsays, 'may I be dear to you!'\n\n2:3:4:3535\\. Thereupon, while standing between the \xc3\x82havaniya and Garhapatya\nand looking eastward at the (former) fire, he mutters (Va _g_. S. III, 28-30),\n'O Lord of prayer, make him sweet-voiced, the offerer of Soma, Kakshivat, U\n_s_ i _g_ 's son!--Be he with us, he the opulent, the killer of woe, the\nbestower of wealth, the increaser of prosperity, he the nimble!--Let not the\ncurse of the evil-doer reach us, nor the guile of the mortal: preserve us, O\nLord of prayer!'\n\n2:3:4:3636\\. Now when he approaches the \xc3\x82havaniya, he approaches the sky; and\nwhen (he approaches) the Garhapatya, (he approaches) the earth. Hereby now (he\napproaches) the ether, that being B _ri_ haspati's region; and that region he\nthereby approaches: this is why he mutters the prayer to B _ri_ haspati.\n\n2:3:4:3737\\. [He continues, Va _g_. S. III, 31-33], 'May the\n\np. 356\n\nmighty, the heavenly, the unassailable favour of the three, Mitra, Aryaman,\nand Varu _n_ a, be (with us)! For the wicked enemy lords it not over them\n(that are protected by these gods), neither at home nor on dangerous paths:\nfor those sons of Aditi bestow undying light on the mortal that he may live!'\n--In this (prayer) he says, 'nor on dangerous paths;' for dangerous indeed are\nthe paths that lie between heaven and earth: those he now walks, and therefore\nhe says, 'nor on dangerous paths.'\n\n2:3:4:3838\\. Then follows a verse to Indra (Va _g_. S. III, 34); for Indra is\nthe deity of the sacrifice, and with Indra therefore he now connects the fire-\nworship: 'At no time, O Indra, art thou barren; and never dost thou fail the\nworshipper--;' the worshipper, doubtless, is the sacrificer: 'never dost thou\nharm the sacrificer,' this is what he thereby says: '--but more and evermore\nis thy gift increased, O mighty god!' thereby he says, 'do thou make us ever\nmore prosperous here!'\n\n2:3:4:3939\\. Then follows a verse to Savit _ri_  1 (Va _g_. S. III, 35),--for\nSavit _ri_ is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the gods; and thus all his (the\nsacrificer's) wishes are fulfilled, impelled as they are by Savit _ri_.--(He\nmutters), 'May we obtain the glorious light of the divine Savit _ri_ , who, we\ntrust, may inspire our prayers!'\n\n2:3:4:4040\\. Thereupon a verse to Agni (Va _g_. S. III, 36),--whereby he\nfinally makes himself over to Agni for protection: 'May thine unapproachable\nchariot, wherewith thou protectest the worshippers, encircle us on every\nside!' The worshippers, doubtless, are\n\np. 357\n\nthe sacrificers; and what unassailable chariot he (Agni) possesses, therewith\nhe protects the sacrificers. Hence he thereby means to say, 'what unassailable\nchariot thou possessest, wherewith thou protectest the sacrificers, therewith\ndo thou guard us on every side.' This (verse) he mutters thrice.\n\n2:3:4:4141\\. He then pronounces his son's name [1](sbe1252.htm#fn_787): 'May\nthis son (N.N.) carry on this manly deed of mine!' Should he have no son, let\nhim insert his own name.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[348:1](sbe1251.htm#fr_783) The Ka _n_ va text has: 'And when he approaches\n(the fires), that (represents) the sacrificer's wish for blessing: what there\nis here for him, that indeed he thereby makes his own (atmani kurute).'\n\n[349:1](sbe1251.htm#fr_784) Or, 'this All' (ida _m_ sarvam). The Ka _n_ va\ntext has bhumanam, 'abundance,' instead.\n\n[349:2](sbe1251.htm#fr_785) The mode of approaching and worshipping the fires\n(agnyupasthana) detailed in pars. 9-41 is ascribed to Vatsapri (author of Rig-\nveda IX, 68; X, 45 and 46), and therefore termed vatsapraupasthana. It is,\nhowever, also called mahopasthana (or dirghopasthana), or great (long)\nworship, as distinguished from the so-called kshullakopasthana (or\nlaghupasthana), or little (short) worship, described in II, 4, 1, and ascribed\nto \xc3\x82suri.\n\n[349:3](sbe1251.htm#fr_786) Or 'upa-kiryate,' according to the Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[350:1](sbe1251.htm#fr_787) Or, as Grassmann, in his translation of the _Ri_\nksa _m_ hita, takes it, 'he whom the active Bh _ri_ gus kindled.'\n\n[353:1](sbe1251.htm#fr_788) Viz. the Agnihotra cow, which has supplied the\nmilk for the morning and evening libation; or any cow, if other material than\nmilk be used.\n\n[354:1](sbe1251.htm#fr_789) Doshavastar, 'the illuminer of the dusk;' or\nperhaps, as Professor Ludwig proposes, 'We approach thee, day by day, at dusk\nand dawn (in the evening and morning), with prayer.'\n\n[356:1](sbe1251.htm#fr_790) Or, the Savitri, that is, the sacred prayer to\nSavit _ri_ , the sun, also called Gayatri, Rig-veda III, 62, to. Cf. [p.\n344](sbe1250.htm#page_344), note [1](sbe1250.htm#fn_772).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 1. Fourth Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe1252.htm)\n\n"
