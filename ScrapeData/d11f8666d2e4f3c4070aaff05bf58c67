On the full-moon day of Marga _s_ irsha the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i ceremony (is\nperformed).\n\n2 2. He cooks a mess of sacrificial food, sacrifices two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations as\nat the _S_ rava _n_ a sacrifice, and other oblations with (the following\nverses):\n\n'The night whom men welcome like a cow that comes to them, (the night) which\nis the consort of the year, may that (night) be auspicious to us. Svaha!\n\np. 339\n\n'The night which is the image of the year, that we worship. May I reach old\nage, imparting strength to my offspring. Svaha!\n\n'To the Sa _m_ vatsara, to the Parivatsara, to the Idavatsara, to the\nIdavatsara, to the Vatsara bring ye great adoration. May we, undecayed,\nunbeaten, long enjoy the favour of these (years) which are worthy of\nsacrifices. Svaha!\n\n'May summer, winter and spring, the rains be friendly, and may autumn be free\nof danger to us. In the safe protection of these seasons may we dwell, (and)\nmay (they) last (to us) through a hundred years. Svaha!'\n\n3\\. He makes oblations of the cooked food to Soma, to (the Nakshatra) M _ri_\nga _s_ iras, to the full moon of Marga _s_ irsha, and to the winter.\n\n4 4. After he has eaten (of the sacrificial food), he throws the remainder of\nthe flour into a basket, (and then follow the same rites that have been stated\nabove) from (the sacrificer's) going out down to their cleaning themselves.\n\n5\\. After the cleaning he says, 'The Bali offering is finished.'\n\n6 6. After they have spread out to the west of the fire a layer (of straw) and\na garment that has\n\np. 340\n\nnot yet been washed, they 'redescend,' having bathed, wearing garments which\nhave not yet been washed: the master (of the house) southward, his wife to the\nnorth (of her husband, and then the other persons belonging to the house) so\nthat each younger one lies more to the north.\n\n7\\. Having caused the Brahman to sit down southward, and having placed to the\nnorth a water-pot, a _S_ ami branch, an earth-clod taken out of a furrow, and\na stone, he murmurs, looking at the fire: 'This Agni is most valiant, he is\nmost blessed, the best giver of a thousand boons, highly powerful. May he\nestablish us both in the highest place.'\n\n8\\. To the west of the fire he joins his hands (and holds them) towards the\neast.\n\n9\\. With the three (verses), 'The divine ship' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XXI, 6-8)\nthey ascend the layer (of straw).\n\n10 10-11. He addresses the Brahman: 'Brahman, we will redescend.'\n\n11\\. The Brahman having given his permission, they redescend with (the words),\n'Life, fame, glory, strength, enjoyment of food, offspring!'\n\n12 12. Those who have received the initiation murmur, 'May a good winter, a\ngood spring, a good summer be bestowed on us. Blessed may be to us the rains;\nmay the autumns be blessed to us.'\n\n13\\. With (the verse), 'Be soft to us, O earth' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XXXV, 21),\nthey lie down on their right sides, their heads turned towards the east.\n\np. 341\n\n14 [14](sbe29193.htm#fn_875). They arise with (the verse), 'Up! with life,\nwith blessed life. Up! with Par _g_ anya's eye, with the seven spaces of the\nearth.'\n\n15\\. This (they repeat) two other times, with the Brahman's permission.\n\n16\\. Let them sleep on the ground four months (after the Pratyavaroha _n_ a),\nor as long as they like.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[338:2](sbe29192.htm#fr_871) 2, 2.
