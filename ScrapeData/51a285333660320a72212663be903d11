S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! When Giris'a thus explained to\nKartikeya the greatness of Rudrak _s_ am, he became satisfied. Now I have\nspoken to you of the glories of the Rudrak _s_ ams as far as I know. Now, as\nto our subject of right way of acting, I will now speak on other things that\nought to be known. Listen. The seeing of Rudrak _s_ am brings in a lakh times\nof Pu _n_ yam and ko _t_ i times the merit arises from touching that; holding\nit brings in ko _t_ i times merit; again if one makes the japam of a Mantra\nwith that Rudrak _s_ am, one obtains merit one hundred lakh ko _t_ i times and\none thousand lakh ko _t_ i times the merit. The merit in holding the Rudrak\n_s_ am is far superior to that in holding Bhadrak _s_ am. The Rudrak _s_ am\nseed that is of the size of an \xc3\x82malaki is the best; which is the of the size\nof a plum, is middling; and which is of the size of a gram is the worst.\n\n\n\np. 1073\n\n\n\nthis is my word and promise. The Rudrak _s_ am tree is of four kinds :--\nBrahma _n_ a, K _s_ attriya, Vais\xc2\x92ya, and S\xc2\x92udra. The white colour is Brahma\n_n_ a; the red colour is K _s_ attriya; the yellow colour is Vais'ya and the\nblack coloured Rudrak _s_ am seed is S\xc2\x92udra. The Brahma _n_ as are to use the\nwhite coloured Rudrak _s_ ams; the K _s_ attriyas, the red coloured ones, the\nVais'yas, the yellow coloured ones; and the S\xc2\x92udras, the black ones. Those\nRudrak _s_ a seeds that are nicely circular, smooth, hard, and whose thorns or\npoints are distinctly visible, are the best. Those that are pierced by\ninsects, broken in parts, whose thorns are not clearly visible, with swells\nand holes and those that are coated over, these six varieties of Rudrak _s_\nams are faulty. Those Rudrak _s_ ams that have their holes by nature running\nthrough and through are best; and those that base their holes pierced by men\nare middling. The Rudrak _s_ a seeds that are all of uniform shape, bright,\nhard, and beautifully circular should be strung together by a silken thread.\nHow to test the Rudrak _s_ a seed? As gold is tested by a touch stone; so the\nRudrak _s_ am is tested by drawing lines on it; those on which the lines are\nmost uniform, bright and beautiful are the best and they should be worn by the\nS\xc2\x92aivas. One should hold one Rudrak _s_ am on the crown hair, thirty on the\nhead, thirty six on the neck; sixteen on each arm, twelve on each wrist, fifty\non the shoulders, one hundred and eight Rudrak _s_ ams in the place of the\nsacrificial thread; and the devotee should have two or three rounds on the\nneck. On the earrings, on the crown of the head, the head, on bracelets, on\narmlets, on necklace, on the ornament worn on the loins one should hold Rudrak\n_s_ am always, whether one sleeps or eats. Holding three hundred Rudrak _s_\nams is the lowest; holding five hundred is middling; holding one thousand\nRudrak _s_ ams is the best; so one ought to wear one thousand Rudrak _s_ ams.\nAt the time of taking Rudrak _s_ am, on one's head, one should utter the\nMantra of \xc3\x8esana; the mantra of Tat Puru _s_ a while holding on one's ears;\nAghora mantra on one's forehead and heart; and the vija of Aghora mantra,\ni.e., \xc2\x93hasau\xc2\x94 while holding on one's hands. One should wear the rosary of\nfifty Rudrak _s_ a seeds, suspended up to the belly, uttering the Vamadeva\nmantra, i.e., Sadyojatadi, etc., the five Brahma mantras, and the six-limbed\nS\xc2\x92iva mantra. One is to string every Rudrak _s_ a seed, uttering the root\nmantra and then hold it. One-faced Rudrak _s_ a reveals Paratattva (the\nhighest Tattva); when worn, the knowledge of the highest Tattva arises; the\nBrahma is seen then. The two-faced Rudrak _s_ am is Ardhanaris'vara, the Lord\nof the other half which represents women (in the same person); if worn,\nArdhanarisvara S\xc2\x92iva is always pleased with that man who holds it. The three-\nfaced Rudrak _s_ am is Fire made manifest; it destroys in a moment the sin of\nkilling a woman.\n\n\n\np. 1074\n\n\n\nThe three-faced Rudrak _s_ am is the three Agnis, Dak _s_ i _n_ agni,\nGarhapatya, and \xc3\x82havaniya; Bhagavan Agni is always pleased with that man who\nwears the three-faced Rudrak _s_ am. The four-faced Rudrak _s_ am is Brahma\nHimself. The wearer gets his prosperity enhanced, his diseases destroyed, the\ndivine knowledge springs in him and his heart is always pleased. The five-\nfaced Rudrak _s_ am is the five faced S\xc2\x92iva Himself; Mahadeva gets pleased\nwith him who holds it. The Presiding Deity of the six faced Rudrak _s_ am is\nKartikeya. Some Pundits take Ga _n_ apati to be the Presiding Deity of the\nsix-faced Rudrak _s_ am. The presiding Deity of the seven-faced Rudrak _s_ am\nis the seven Matrikas, the Sun and the seven Ri _s_ is. By putting on this,\nthe prosperity is increased, health and the pure knowledge are established. It\nshould be put on when one becomes pure. The Presiding Deity of the eight-faced\nRudrak _s_ am is Brahmi, the eight Matrikas. By holding this, the eight Vasus\nare pleased and the river Ganges is also pleased. The putting on of this makes\nthe Jivas truthful and pleasant-minded. The Devata of the nine-faced Rudrak\n_s_ am is Yama; holding this puts off the fears of Death. The Devata of the\neleven-faced Rudrak _s_ am is ten quarters, the ten quarters are pleased with\nhim who wears the ten-faced Rudrak _s_ am. The Devata of the eleven mouthed\nRudrak _s_ am is the eleven Rudras and Indra. Holding this enhances happiness.\nThe twelve-faced Rudrak _s_ am is Vi _sn_ u made manifest; its Devatas are the\ntwelve \xc3\x82dityas; the devotees of S\xc2\x92iva should hold this. The thirteen-faced\nRudrak _s_ am, if worn, enables one to secure one's desires; he does nowhere\nexperience failures. The Kama Deva becomes pleased with him who wears this.\nThe fourteen-faced Rudrak _s_ am destroys all diseases and gives eternal\nhealth. While holding this, one ought not to take wine, flesh, onion, garlic,\nSaj\xc3\xb1a fruit, Chalta fruit and the flesh of the boar which eats excrements,\netc. During the Lunar and Solar eclipses, during the Uttaraya _n_ a S\xc2\x92amkranti\nor the Dak _s_ i _n a_yana S\xc2\x92amkranti, during the full Moon or the New Moon\nday, if Rudrak _s_ am be worn, one becomes instantly freed of all one's sins.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventh Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the greatness of one\nfaced, etc., Rudrak _s_ am in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk11ch08.htm)\n\n"
