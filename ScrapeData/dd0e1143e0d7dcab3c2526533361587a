They also say, 'If the fire were to go out after the first\nlibation has been offered, what rite and what expiation would there be in that\ncase?' Having thrown down (on the fire-place) any log of wood he may find\nlying near by 1, let him offer thereon, saying, 'In every (piece of) wood\nthere is a fire,' for, indeed, there is a fire in every (piece of) wood. But\nif his heart should at all misgive him, he may offer upon gold; for gold,\ndoubtless, is Agni's seed; and the father is the same as the son, and the son\nis the same as the father: he may therefore offer upon gold. This, then, is\nthe rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:3:22\\. They also say, 'If, after being taken out (from the Garhapatya),\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya were to go out\n\np. 188\n\nbefore the Agnihotra (has been offered), what rite and what expiation would\nthere be in that case?' Let him take it out (again) from the Garhapatya (and\nbring it) forward, and, having laid it down (on the \xc3\x82havaniya hearth), let him\noffer the Agnihotra thereon. And were it to go out again and again, after\nbeing taken out even a hundred times, let him take it out (again) from the\nGarhapatya, and, having laid it down, let him offer the Agnihotra thereon.\nThis, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:3:33\\. They also say, 'If the Garhapatya were to go out, what rite and\nwhat expiation would there be in that case?' Well, some churn it out from a\nfirebrand, saying, 'Whereby man's (body) is destroyed in the end, it is\ntherefrom he desires the expiation of this (mishap).' Let him, however, not do\nthis; but let them proceed by taking either a firebrand, or a piece from a\nfirebrand;--let him do it in this way:--having taken a coal from a firebrand,\nlet him crumble it on the two churning-sticks, for (in this way) he obtains\nboth that desire which is contained in the (fire) churned out of a firebrand,\nand that which is contained in (the fire churned out from) the churning-\nsticks. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:3:44\\. They also say, 'If they take out fire for any one and put it with\n(the burning \xc3\x82havaniya) fire, what rite and what expiation would there be in\nthat case?' When uniting, these two (fires), if unappeased, would indeed be\nliable to burn up the Sacrificer's family and cattle: let him therefore utter\nupon them the text (Va _g_. S. XII, 57, 58), 'Unite ye two, and get ye on\ntogether, loving, radiant, well disposed, dwelling together for food and\ndrink!--Together have I brought\n\np. 189\n\nyour minds, together your rites, together your thoughts: O Agni Purishya, be\nthou the overlord, and bestow thou food and drink upon our Sacrificer!' He\nthereby bespeaks peace on the part of those two for the safety of the\nSacrificer's family and cattle.\n\n12:4:3:55\\. But if his heart should at all misgive him, let him prepare a cake\non eight potsherds to Agni Agnimat (the fire possessed of a fire). The course\nof procedure thereof (is as follows):--he should recite seventeen kindling-\nverses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of V _ri_ tra 1; the sa\n_m_ ya _g_ yas 2 are two Vira _g_ verses; and the invitatory and offering\nformulas (of the chief oblation) are as follows:--(the anuvakya, _Ri_ g-veda\nS. I, 12, 6), 'Agni is kindled by Agni, he, the sage, the youthful house-lord,\nthe tongue-mouthed bearer of oblations;' and the ya _g_ ya, 'For thou, O Agni,\nart kindled by Agni, priest, as thou art, by a priest, friend by friend.' He\nthereby bespeaks peace on the part of those two, for the safety of the\nSacrificer's family and cattle. This, then, is the rite performed in that\ncase.\n\n12:4:3:66\\. They also say, 'If any one's Garhapatya were to go out when the\n\xc3\x82havaniya has not gone out, what rite and what expiation would there be in\nthat case?' Now, some take (a new fire) out from that same (\xc3\x82havaniya hearth,\nand carry it) forwards 3,\n\np. 190\n\nsaying, 'The fires are the vital airs: it is the vital airs we thus take up\nfor him.' But let him not do this, for if, in that case, any one were to say\nof him, 'Surely this one has obstructed the forward vital airs 1: this\nSacrificer will die,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.\n\n12:4:3:77\\. And some, indeed, take (the \xc3\x82havaniya) back (to the Garhapatya 2),\nsaying, 'These two are the out-breathing and the up-breathing.' But let him\nnot do this; for conducive to heaven, indeed, is the Agnihotra; and if, in\nthat case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this one has descended again\nfrom the heavenly world: this (offering) will be in no wise conducive to\nheaven for him,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.\n\n12:4:3:88\\. And some, indeed, churn out another Garhapatya; but let him not do\nthis, for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this one has\nraised a spiteful enemy from out of the fire 3: speedily a spiteful enemy will\nbe raised to him; he (the Sacrificer) will weep 4 for him who is dearest to\nhim,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.\n\n12:4:3:99\\. And some, again, extinguish (the \xc3\x82havaniya fire) and churn out\nanother;--let him not yield to a desire for this; (for if, in that case, any\none were to\n\np. 191\n\nsay of him 1), 'He has caused to be extinguished even what was left him: no\nheir will remain to him,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.\n\n12:4:3:1010\\. Let him rather proceed thus:--having lifted the two fires on the\ntwo churning-sticks 2, let him betake himself northwards, and, having churned\nout (the fire), let him remain there offering; for in this way he passes no\ncensure on any one, and towards night offering is made by him at his new\nresting-place.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[187:1](sbe44060.htm#fr_521) Pratyasanno vi _s_ atiti prative _s_ a _h_\nsamipastha _h_ , comm.\n\n[189:1](sbe44060.htm#fr_522) That is, their Anuvakyas refer to V _ri_ trahan.\n\n[189:2](sbe44060.htm#fr_523) That is, the anuvakya (invitatory formula) and ya\n_g_ ya (offering-formula) recited for the oblation to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_\nt.
