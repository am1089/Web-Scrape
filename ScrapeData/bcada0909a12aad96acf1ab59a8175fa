 \nThat thou content with scanty food  \nAll touch of ire hast long subdued;  \nThat all thy vows are well maintained;  \n\np. 317  \n\nWhile peace of mind is surely gained:  \nThat reverence of the saints who taught  \nThe faithful heart due fruit has brought.'  \n   The aged votaress pure of taint,  \nRevered by every perfect saint,  \nRose to her feet by Rama's side  \nAnd thus in gentle tones replied:  \n'My penance' meed this day I see  \nComplete, my lord, in meeting thee.  \nThis day the fruit of birth I gain,  \nNor have I served the saints in vain,  \nI reap rich fruits of toil and vow,  \nAnd heaven itself awaits me now,  \nWhen I, O chief of men, have done  \nHonour to thee the godlike one.  \nI feel, great lord, thy gentle eye  \nMy earthly spirit purify,  \nAnd I, brave tamer of thy foes,  \nShall through thy grace in bliss repose.  \nThy feet by Chitrakata strayed  \nWhen those great saints whom I obeyed,  \nIn dazzling chariots bright of hue,  \nHence to their heavenly mansions flew.  \nAs the high saints were borne away  \nI heard their holy voices say:  \n   'In this pure grove, O devotee,  \nPrince Rama soon will visit thee.  \nWhen he and Lakshman seek this shade,  \nBe to thy guests all honour paid.  \nHim shalt thou see, and pass away  \nTo those blest worlds which ne'er decay.'  \nTo me, O mighty chief, the best  \nOf lofty saints these words addressed.  \nLaid up within my dwelling lie  \nFruits of each sort which woods supply,--  \nFood culled for thee in endless store  \nFrom every tree on Pampa's shore.'  \n   Thus to her virtuous guest she sued  \nAnd he, with heavenly lore endued,  \nWords such as these in turn addressed  \nTo her with equal knowledge blest:  \n'Danu himself the power has told  \nOf thy great masters lofty-souled.  \nNow if thou will, mine eyes would fain  \nAssurance of their glories gain.'  \n   She heard the prince his wish declare:  \nThen rose she, and the royal pair  \nOf brothers through the wood she led  \nThat round her holy dwelling spread.  \n'Behold Matanga's wood' she cried,  \n'A grove made famous far and wide,  \nDark as thick clouds and tilled with herds  \nOf wandering deer, and joyous birds.  \nIn this pure spot each reverend sire  \nWith offerings fed the holy fire.  \nSee here the western altar stands  \nWhere daily with their trembling hands  \nThe aged saints, so long obeyed  \nBy me, their gifts of blossoms laid.  \nThe holy power, O Raghu's son,  \nBy their ascetic virtue won,  \nStill keeps their well-loved altar bright.  \nFilling the air with beams of light.  \nAnd those seven neighbouring lakes behold  \nWhich, when the saints infirm and old,  \nWorn out by fasts, no longer sought,  \nMoved hither drawn by power of thought.  \nLook, Rama, where the devotees  \nHung their bark mantles on the trees.  \nFresh from the bath: those garments wet  \nThrough many a day are dripping yet.  \nSee, through those aged hermits' power  \nThe tender spray, this bright-hued flower  \nWith which the saints their worship paid,  \nFresh to this hour nor change nor fade.  \nHere thou hast seen each lawn and dell,  \nAnd heard the tale I had to tell:  \nPermit thy servant, lord, I pray,  \nTo cast this mortal shell away,  \nFor I would dwell, this life resigned,  \nWith those great saints of lofty mind,  \nWhom I within this holy shade  \nWith reverential care obeyed.'  \n   When Rama and his brother heard  \nThe pious prayer the dame preferred,  \nFilled full of transport and amazed  \nThey marvelled as her words they praised.  \nThen Rama to the votaress said  \nWhose holy vows were perfected  \n   'Go, lady, where thou fain wouldst be,  \nO thou who well hast honoured me.'  \n   Her locks in hermit fashion tied,  \nClad in hark coat and black deer-hide,  \nWhen Rama gave consent, the dame  \nResigned her body to the flame.  \nThen like the fire that burns and glows.  \nTo heaven the sainted lady rose,  \nIn all her heavenly garments dressed,  \nImmortal wreaths on neck and breast,  \nBright with celestial gems she shone  \nMost beautiful to look upon,  \nAnd like the flame of lightning sent  \nA glory through the firmament.  \nThat holy sphere the dame attained,  \nBy depth of contemplation gained,  \nWhere roam high saints with spirits pure  \nIn bliss that shall for aye endure.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXVI.: Pampa.](ry274.htm)\n\n"
