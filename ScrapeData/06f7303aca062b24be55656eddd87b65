Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! How did the eternal Devi Maha Lak _s_ mi the\ndweller in Vaiku _nt_ ha, the beloved of Naraya _n_ a, the Presiding Deity of\nVaiku _nt_ ha, come down to the earth and how She, became the daughter of the\nocean? By whom was She first praised? Kindly describe all these in detail to\nme and oblige.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n3-10. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! In ancient days when on Durvasa\xc2\x92s curse,\nIndra was dispossesed of his kingdom, all the Devas came down to earth. Lak\n_s_ mi, too, getting angry, quitted the Heavens, out of pain and sorrow and\nwent to Vaiku _nt_ ha and took the shelter of Naraya _n_ a. The Devas, then,\nwent to Brahma with their hearts full of sorrow and, taking Him from there,\nthey all went to Naraya _n_ a in Vaiku _nt_ ha. Going there they all took\nrefuge of the Lord of Vaiku _nt_ ha. They were very much distressed and their\nthroats, palate and lips were quite dry. At that time Lak _s_ mi, the wealth\nand prosperity of all, came down on earth by the command of Naraya _n_ a and\nbecame born in part as the daughter of the ocean. The Devas, then with the\nDaityas churned the K _s_ iroda Ocean and, out of that, Maha\n\n\n\np. 960\n\n\n\nLak _s_ mi appeared. Vi _sn_ u looked on Her. Her joy knew no bounds. She\nsmiling, granted boons to the Devas and then offered a garland of flowers on\nthe neck of Naraya _n_ a (as a symbol of marriage celebrated). O Narada! the\nDevas, on the other hand, got back their kingdoms from the Asuras. They then\nworshipped and chanted hymns to Maha Lak _s_ mi and since then they became\nfree from further dangers and troubles.\n\n\n\n11-12. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! Durvasa was the best of the Munis; he was\nattached to Brahma and had spiritual knowledge. Why did he curse Indra? What\noffence had he committed? How did the Devas and Daityas churn the ocean? How,\nand by what hymns Lak _s_ mi became pleased and appeared before Indra? What\npassed on between them. Say all this, O Lord.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13-25. Naraya _n_ a said :-- In ancient days, Indra the Lord of the three\nworlds, intoxicated with wine and becoming lustful and shameless, began to\nenjoy Rambha in a lonely grove. After having enjoyed her, he became attracted\nto her; his mind being wholly drawn to her, he remained there in that forest,\nhis mind becoming very passionate. Indra then saw the Muni Durvasa on his way\nfrom Vaiku _nt_ ha to Kailas\xc2\x92a burning with the fire of Brahma. From the body\nof the Ri _s_ i, emitted, as it were, the rays of the thousand midday Suns. On\nhis head was the golden matted hair. On his breast there was the hoary holy\nthread; he wore torn clothes; on his hands there was the Da _nd_ a and Kama\n_nd_ alu; on his forehead there was the bright Tilaka in the form of the\nCrescent Moon. (Tilaka - a sectarian mark on the forehead made with coloured\nearth or sandalpaste.)\n\n\n\nOne hundred thousand disciples, thoroughly-versed in the Vedas and the\nVedangas, were attending him. The intoxicated Purandara, seeing him, bowed\ndown to him and he began to chant with devotion hymns to his disciples also.\nThey were very glad. The Ri _s_ i with his disciples then blessed Indra and\ngave him one Parijata flower.\n\n\n\nWhen the Muni was returning from the region of Vaiku _nt_ ha, Vi _sn_ u, gave\nhim that beautiful Parijata flower. Old age, death, disease, sorrows, etc.,\nall are removed by the influence of the flower; and the final liberation is\nalso attained. The Devendra was intoxicated with his wealth; so taking the\nflower given by the Ri _s_ i, he threw it on the head of the elephant\nAirarata. No sooner the elephant touched the flower, than he became suddenly\nlike Vi _sn_ u, as it were, in beauty, form, qualities, fire and age. The\nelephant, then, forsook Indra and\n\n\n\np. 961\n\n\n\nentered into a dense forest. The Lord of the Devas could, in no way, get him\nunder his control. On the other hand, the Muni Durvasa seeing that Mahendra\nhad thus dishonoured the flower, became inflamed with rage and cursed him\nsaying, \xc2\x93O Indra! You are so mad with wealth that you have dishonoured me. The\nflower that I gave you so lovingly, you have thrown that, out of vanity, on\nthe elephant\xc2\x92s head!\n\n\n\n26-46. No sooner one gets the food, water, fruits that had been offered to Vi\n_sn_ u, one should eat that at once. Otherwise one incurs the sin of\nBrahmahattya. If anybody forsakes the things offered to Vi _sn_ u, that he has\ngot perchance, he becomes destitute of wealth, prosperity, intelligence, and\nhis kingdom. And if he eats the food already offered to Vi _sn_ u with\ndevotion, he then elevates his hundred families passed before him and he\nhimself becomes liberated while living. If anybody daily eats Vi _sn_ u\xc2\x92s\nNaivedyam (food offered to Vi _sn_ u) and bow down before Him or worships Hari\nwith devotion and chants hymns to Him, he becomes like Vi _sn_ u in energy and\nwealth. By mere touch with the air round about his body, the places of\npilgrimage become all purified. O You Stupid! The earth becomes purified by\nthe contact of the dust of the feet of such a one devoted to Vi _sn_ u. If\nanybody eats the food unoffered to Hari and flesh that is not offered to any\nDeity; if he eats the food of any unchaste woman, any woman without husband\nand sons, the food offered at any S\xc2\x92udra\xc2\x92s Sradh (funeral) ceremony, the food\noffered by a Brahma _n_ a, who is a priest to the S\xc2\x92udras in honour of a S\xc2\x92iva\nLingam, the food of a Brahma _n_ priest who subsists on the presents of a\ntemple, the food of one who sells his daughter, the food of one who subsists\non dealing with womb concerns, the leavings of others, the stale food left\nafter all others had eaten, the food of the husband of an unmarried girl\n(twelve years old in whom menstruation has commenced), the driver of oxen, the\nfood of one uninitiated in one\xc2\x92s I _st_ amantram, of one who burns a corpse,\nof a Brahmi _n_ who goes to one not fit for going, the food of a rebel against\nfriends, of one who is faithless, treacherous, who gives false evidence, the\nfood of a Brahmi _n_ who accepts offerings in a sacred place of pilgrimage,\nall his sins (incurred in the ways above-mentioned) will be removed if he eats\nthe prasadam of Vi _sn_ u, i.e., the food offered to Vi _sn_ u. Even if a Cha\n_nd_ ala be attached to the service of Vi _sn_ u, he sanctifies his millions\nof persons born in his family before him. And the man who is devoid of the\ndevotion to Hari is not able even to save himself. If anybody takes\nunknowingly the remains of an offering (such as flowers) made to Vi _sn_ u,\n\n\n\np. 962\n\n\n\nhe will certainly be freed from all the sins incurred in his seven births. And\nif he does this knowingly and with intense devotion, he will certainly be\nfreed of all sorts of sins incurred in his Ko _t_ i births. So, O Indra! I am\na devotee of S\xc2\x92ri Hari. And when you have cast away the Parijata to flower\noffered by me on the elephant\xc2\x92s head, then I say unto you that the Maha Lak\n_s_ mi will leave you and She will go back to Naraya _n_ a. I am highly\ndevoted to Naraya _n_ a; so I do not fear anybody, I fear neither the Creator,\nnor Kala, the Destroyer, nor old age, nor death; what to speak of other petty\npersons! I do not fear your father Prajapati Kas\xc2\x92yapa nor do I fear your\nfamily priest Brihaspati. Now he, on whose head there lies the flower Parijata\noffered by me, verily he should be worshipped by all means.\xc2\x94 Hearing these\nwords of Durvasa, Indra became bewildered with fear, and being greatly\ndistressed and holding the feet of Muni, cried out loudly. He said :-- \xc2\x93The\ncurse is now well inflicted on me; and it has caused my delusion to vanish.\nNow I do not want back my Raja Lak _s_ mi from you; instruct me on knowledge.\nThis wealth is the source of all coils; it is the cause of the veil to all\nknowledge, it hides the final liberation and it is a great obstacle on the way\nto get the highest devotion.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n47-67. The Muni said :--\xc2\x93This birth, death, old age, disease, and afflictions,\nall come from wealth and the manipulation of great power. Being blind by the\ndarkness of wealth, he does not see the road to Mukti. The stupid man that is\nintoxicated with wealth is like the one that is intoxicated with wine.\nSurrounded by many friends, he is surrounded by the unbreakable bondage. The\nman that is intoxicated with wealth, blind with property and overwhelmed with\nthese things has no thought for the real knowledge. He who is Rajasik, is very\nmuch addicted to passions and desires; he never sees the path to Sattvagu _n_\na. The man that is blind with sense-objects is of two kinds, firstly, Rajasik\nand secondly Tamasik. He who has no knowledge of the S\xc2\x92astras is Tamasik and\nhe who has the knowledge of the S\xc2\x92astras is Rajasik. O Child of the Devas! Two\npaths are mentioned in the S\xc2\x92astras; one is Pravritti, going towards the sense\nobjects and the other is Nivritti, going away from them. The Jivas first\nfollow the path of Pravritti, the path that is painful, gladly and of their\nown accord like a mad man. As bees, blind with the desire of getting honey, go\nto the lotus bud and get themselves entangled there, so the Jivas, the\nembodied souls, desirous first of getting enjoyments come to this very painful\ncircle of births and deaths, this worldly life, which in the end is realised\nas vapid and the only cause of old age, death, and sorrow and get themselves\nenchained there.\n\n\n\np. 963\n\n\n\nFor many births he travels gladly in various wombs, ordained by his own\nKarmas, till at last by the favour of gods, he comes in contact with the\nsaints. Thus one out of a thousand or out of a hundred finds means to cross\nthis terrible ocean of world. When the saintly persons kindle the lamp of\nknowledge and show the way to Mukti, then the Jiva makes an attempt to sever\nthis bondage to the world. After many births, many austerities and many\nfastings, he then finds safely the way to Mukti, leading to the highest\nhappiness. O Indra! What you asked me, I thus heard from my Guru.\xc2\x94 O Narada!\nhearing the words of the Muni Durvasa Indra became dispassionate towards the\nSamsara. Day by day his feeling of dispassion increased. One day, when he\nreturned to his own home from the hermitage of the Muni, he saw the Heavens\noverspread by the Daityas and it had become terrible. At some places outrage\nand oppression knew no bounds; some places were devoid of friends; at some\nplaces, some persons had lost their fathers, mothers, wives, relations; so no\nrest and repose could be found. Thus, seeing the Heavens in the hands of the\nenemies, Indra went out in quest of Brihaspati, the family preceptor of the\nDevas. Seeking to and fro Indra ultimately went to the banks of the Mandakini\nand saw that the Guru Deva had bathed in the waters of the Mandakini and\nsitting with his face turned towards the East towards the Sun, was meditating\non Para Brahma, Who has His faces turned everywhere. Tears were flowing from\nhis eyes and the hairs of the body stood erect with delight. He was elderly in\nknowledge; the spiritual Teacher of all, religious, served by all great men;\nhe was held as most dear to all the friends. Those who are J\xc3\xb1anins regard him\nas their Guru. He was the eldest of all his brothers; he was considered as\nvery unpopular to the enemies of the Devas. Seeing the family priest\nBrihaspati merged in that state of meditation, Indra waited there. When after\none Prahara (three hours), the Guru Deva got up, Indra bowed down to his feet\nand began to weep and cry out repeatedly. Then he informed his Guru about his\ncurse from a Brahmi _n_ , his acquiring the true knowledge as so very rare,\nand the wretched state of Amaravati, wrought by the enemies.\n\n\n\n68-92. O Best of Brahma _n_ as! Hearing thus the words of the disciple, the\nintelligent speaker Brihaspati spoke with his eyes reddened out of anger. \xc2\x93O\nLord of the Devas! I have heard everything that you said; do not cry; have\npatience; hear attentively what I say. The wise politicians of good behaviour,\nwith moral precepts, never lose their heads and get themselves distressed in\ntimes of danger. Nothing is everlasting; whether property or adversity; all\nare transient;\n\n\n\np. 964\n\n\n\nthey only give troubles. All are under one\xc2\x92s own Karma; one is master of one\xc2\x92s\nown Karma. What had been done in previous births, so one will have to reap the\nfruits afterwards. (Therefore property or adversity, all are due to one\xc2\x92s own\nKarma.) This happens to all persons eternally, births after births. Pain and\nhappiness are like the ring of a rolling wheel. So what pain is there? It is\nalready stated that one\xc2\x92s own Karma must be enjoyed in this Holy Bharata. The\nman enjoys the effects of his own Karmas, auspicious or inauspicious. Never\nthe Karma gets exhausted in one hundred Ko _t_ i Kalpas, without their effects\nbeing enjoyed. The Karma, whether auspicious or inauspicious must be enjoyed.\nThus it is stated in the Vedas and as well by S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Supreme\nSpirit. Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a addressed Brahma, the lotus-born, in the Sama\nVeda Sakha that all persons acquire their births, whether, in Bharata or in\nany other country, according to the Karma that he had done. The course of a\nBrahma _n_ a comes though this Karma; and the blessings of a Brahma _n_ a come\nagain by this Karma. By Karma one gets great wealth and prosperity and by\nKarma again one gets poverty. You may take one hundred Ko _t_ i births; the\nfruit of Karma must follow you. O Indra! The fruit of Karma follows one like\none\xc2\x92s shadow. Without enjoyment, that can never die. The effects of Karma\nbecome increased or decreased according to time, place, and the person\nconcerned. As you will give away anything to persons, of different natures, in\ndifferent times and in different places, your merit acquired will also vary\naccordingly. Gifts made on certain special days bring in Ko _t_ i times the\nfruits (merits, pu _n_ yam) or infinite times or even more than that. Again\ngifts, similar in nature, made in similar paces yield pu _n_ yam the same, in\ncharacter also. Gifts made in different countries yield pu _n_ yams, Ko _t_ i\ntimes, infinite times, or even more than that. But similar things given to\nsimilar persons yield similar pu _n_ yams. As the grains vary in their natures\nas the fields differ, so gifts made to different persons yield different\ngrades of pu _n_ yas infinitely superior or infinitely inferior as the case\nmay be.\n\n\n\nGiving things to a Brahma _n_ a on any ordinary day yields simple pu _n_ ya\nonly. But if the gift be made to a Brahma _n_ on an Amavasya day (new moon\nday) or on a Sankranti day (the day when the Sun enters another\xc2\x92s sign) then\nhundred times more pu _n_ yam is acquired. Again charities made on the\nChaturmasya period (the vow that lasts for four months in the rainy season) or\non the full moon day, yield infinite pu _n_ yams. So charities made on the\noccasion of the lunar eclipses yield Ko _t_ i times the result and if made on\nthe occasion of the solar eclipse yield ten times more pu _n_ yams. Charities\nmade on Ak _s_ ayaya Tritiya or the Navami day yield infinite and endless\nresults. So charities on other holy days yield religious merits\n\n\n\np. 965\n\n\n\nhigher than those made on ordinary days. As charities made on holy days yield\nreligious merits, so bathing, reciting mantrams, and other holy acts yield\nmeritorious results. As superior results are obtained by pious acts; inferior\nresults are obtained by impious acts. As an earthen potter makes pots, jars,\netc., out of the earth with the help of rod, wheel, earthen cups or plates and\nmotion, so the Creator awards respective fruits to different persons, by the\nhelp of this thread (continuity) of Karma. Therefore if you want to have\ncessation of this fruition of Karma, then worship Naraya _n_ a, by whose\ncommand all these things of Nature are created. He is the Creator of even\nBrahma, the Creator, the Preserver of Vi _sn_ u, the Preserver, the Destroyer\nof S\xc2\x92iva, the Destroyer and the Kala (the great Time) of Kala (the Time).\nS\xc2\x92ankara has said :-- He who remembers Madhusudana (a name of Vi _sn_ u) in\ngreat troubles, his dangers cease and happiness begins.\xc2\x94 O Narada! The wise\nBrihaspati thus advised Indra and then embraced him and gave him his hearty\nblessings and good wishes.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fortieth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the birth of Lak _s_ mi in\nthe discourse of Narada and Naraya _n_ a in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 41](bk09ch41.htm)\n\n'
