And in the second place Sadasaspati (cf. Mantrap. I, 9, 8).\n\n3\\. They reject a sacrifice performed by a wife or by one who has not received\nthe Upanayana initiation, and a sacrifice of salt or pungent food, or of such\nfood as has an admixture of a despised sort of food.\n\n4\\. Sacrifices connected with special wishes and Bali sacrifices (should be\nperformed) as stated (even against the clauses of the last Sutra).\n\n5\\. Whenever the fire flames up of itself, he should put two pieces of wood on\nit with the next two (verses: M. I, 9, 9-10),\n\n6\\. Or with (the two formulas), 'May fortune reach me! May fortune come to\nme!'\n\n7\\. Let him notice the day on which he brings his wife home.\n\n8\\. (From that day) through three nights they should both sleep on the ground,\nthey should be chaste, and should avoid salt and pungent food.\n\n9\\. Between their sleeping-places a staff is interposed, which is anointed\nwith perfumes and wrapped round with a garment or a thread.\n\n10\\. In the last part of the fourth night he takes up the (staff) with the\nnext two (verses; M. I, 10, 1-2), washes it and put it away; then (the\nceremonies) from the putting of wood on the fire down to the \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhaga\noblations (are performed), and while she takes hold of him, he sacrifices the\noblations (indicated by the) next (Mantras; M. I, 10, 3-9); then he enters\nupon the performance of the _G_ aya and following oblations, and performs (the\n\np. 268\n\nrites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire). Then he makes her\nsit down to the west of the fire, facing the east, and pours some \xc3\x82 _g_ ya of\nthe remains (of those oblations) on her head with the (three) Vyah _ri_ tis\nand the word Om as the fourth (M. I, 10, 10-13). Then they look at each other\nwith the next two verses (M. I, 11, 1-2), according to the characteristics\n(contained in those verses); with the next verse (M. I, 11, 3) he besmears the\nregion of their hearts with remains of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya; then he should murmur the\nnext three verses (I, 11, 4-6), and should murmur the rest (of the Anuvaka; I,\n11, 7-11) when cohabiting with her.\n\n11\\. Or another person should recite (the rest of the Anuvaka) over her,\n(before they cohabit).\n\n12. 12 During her (first) monthly illness he instructs her about the things forbidden (to menstruous women), contained in the Brahma _n_ a, in the section, 'A menstruous woman with whom,' &c.\n\n13\\. After the appearance of her monthly illness, he should, when going to\ncohabit with her after her illness, recite over her, after she has bathed, the\nnext verses (M. I, 12, 1-13, 4).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[266:1](sbe30101.htm#fr_752) 8, 1.
