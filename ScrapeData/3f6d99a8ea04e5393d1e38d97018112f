On it, in low relief, is a quaint design of peacocks, pecking their\nmutual beaks into a conventional-looking pot of basil that stands between\nthem. Its worth, in money, is some few farthings. For little more it was\nbought; sold, doubtless, for something less; and it is worn only by such as\ncan at no time in their frugal lives afford the few shillings necessary to buy\nits like in silver.\n\nAnd yet, poor as it is, this Indian amulet may have been an heirloom in its\ntime. Generation after generation of mothers may have worn it daily, as they\nwent forth at dawn, and came back at sunset; worn it alike at toil and at\nrest. Time after time may it have been handed on to the little daughter on her\nmarriage, or to the daughter-in-law when welcomed for the first time to the\npeasant-home. Or the chain, or string of coins, on which it hung, has been\nunclasped for ever maybe by the wearer in the bitter hours of widowhood, or\nreverently lifted by a sorrowful son or daughter\n\np. 106\n\nere the dead form of the mother was borne forth to the village burning-ghat.\nFor it belongs, this simple rustic ornament, to another order than the\npresent. It comes of the time when no hard-and-fast line divided art from\nindustry; when, every need being met by manual toil, the enthusiasm of the\ncreator limited his work, and possessions could not be quickly changed but\nmust be made strong to accumulate from age to age. The farmhouse kitchen of a\ncentury ago in Europe, shining with oak and brass; the border of the Kashmir\nshawl in India, transferred by skilful fingers from one web to another; and\nthis amulet of mine, are not modern in kind and origin, but mediaeval.\n\nIf only it could utter all the secrets it may remember, what might we not hope\nto hear! For according to the customs of Silao, whence it came, the place of\nthis amulet is over the heart of the village maid. Thus it has lain year in\nyear out; and of the things that tell themselves in silence, by the catching\nof a breath or the quickening of a pulse; of the long sweet tale of wifely\nhappiness and motherly cares; of the struggle with poverty and the achievement\nof prosperity; of moments of rapture and insight, kneeling before some image\nin a temple, or watching the cows wend home at time of cowdust--of all these\nthings how much it has heard! How much, could it but speak, it might reveal!\n\np. 107\n\nAnd yet the story, told in such fashion and from such a viewpoint, might after\nall seem strangely familiar. For it is open to question whether there be much\ndistance between the humanity of any two villages, though one be Indian and\nthe other English or Italian. In externals, of course, their characteristics\nare strongly marked--there is no mistaking one for another. I cannot forget\nthe first time I saw that ancient market-town in Behar, which is known as\nSilao. How interesting a province is Behar itself! The traveller in Brittany\nhas heard the peasants talk of "going into France," and similarly in Behar,\nthough it is an integral part of Bengal, one drops instinctively into the\nBreton attitude, and thinks of the Gangetic Plain as of a foreign country. And\nSilao is really ancient, in the Eastern sense. It is only a tiny township,\nbuilt of mud, yet it is quite possible that its popped rice was as famous in\nthe countryside thirty-five centuries ago as it is to-day. So long since, at\nleast, was probably the first appearance of the neighbourhood on the stage of\nhistory. The very dust is fraught with memories. On the time-worn highroad,\nbetween Baragaon, the old university of Nalanda, and Rajgir, the pre-Asokan\ncapital of the kings of Bengal, stands the village, in the midst of the far-\nstretching green of its fields of rice. And through it Buddha must have\npassed, ere he overtook\n\np. 108\n\nthe great multitude of goats going up to the sacrifice, and, according to the\nlegend, lifted the lame kid and carried it on his neck, that it might keep\npace with the herds. Often and often, even now, one may meet with such good\nshepherds on the roads about Silao, and still better, a few miles farther on,\noutside the modern village of Rajgir. Daily there, from dawn almost till noon,\nthe constant patter of hoofs large and small betokens the passing of hundreds\nof cows, buffaloes, sheep, and goats out of the village, through the mountain-\ndefile, with its hot springs, into the pastures that cover to-day the\nhillsides and the ruins of Old Rajgir. And here again, as afternoon draws on\nto dusk, one may witness the return homeward of the flocks, or, later, watch\nwhile a missing cow or two comes crashing through the brushwood, in answer to\nthe call of the herdsman from the outstanding rocks by the stream-side. It is\nthen that one may be happy enough to meet a belated goat-herd, his form\nlooming larger than common through the quickly-passing twilight, who could not\nbut have lingered, because, while he bears some footsore little one, he also\nleads perhaps a weary mother, tenderly, along the darkening road.\n\nThere are women-tenders of the herds, as well as men. Tall they are, and free\nof gait, very gentle, and very very proud, these Hindu women of the old rustic\nworld. Their costumes alone\n\np. 109\n\nwould be sufficient to mark them out as beautiful and distinguished, though\nthey are mere peasant folk; for it is rarely that one meets here even a widow\nwearing the stainless white of the higher classes of Bengal. Crimson and green\nand scarlet are, in Behar, the favourite colours for the _sari_ \\--that long\nbroad scarf, which forms the main garment as well as the veil of the Indian\nwoman. The coarse clinging cotton, covering the head and falling thence to the\nwaist to form the skirt, is embroidered all over, in a bold effective stitch,\nwith the little curling pine-cone, or palmetto, that is so characteristic an\nelement in Indian decoration. Long long ago these women have forgotten its why\nand wherefore. They would not dream of connecting their adoption of the\nadmired design with the emblematic jewel on a royal turban; and yet it is not\nunlikely that their constant use of the pattern perpetuates the fact that six\nhundred years, or perhaps a thousand, before Christ, Rajgir was a King\'s\nburgh.\n\nQuite as beautiful as the _sari_ , in its own way, is the little bodice--\noftenest of dark blue, outlined with scarlet--that covers the bust and falls\nseverely from the throat to conceal the head of the skirt. It is cut back at\nthe neck leaving the head free, and the tight sleeves go only half-way to the\nelbow. Its greatest beauty, however, lies in its straightness; there is very\nlittle cutting-out in\n\np. 110\n\nancient costume. In the Greek _chiton_ , the Japanese _kimono_ , the Himalayan\n_choga_ , and in this _jama_ and _sari_ of Northern India there is too much\nrespect for the lines of material to suffer the figure-modelling that we call\ndress-making. So this Behari blouse or _jama_ is made only of four pieces--two\nbreadths back and front and a half-breadth added under each arm, as _modistes_\nmight say--and they are all straight. But oh, how lissom and willowy is the\nfigure within! And how commandingly beautiful is often the dark face, with its\nlarge brown eyes shadowed by the rich colours of the veil!\n\nIt was our first visit to Silao, and we were in the very middle of the bazaar,\nwhere three roads meet. We had clattered in our noisy vehicles up the village\nstreet; past the old brass-shop, where an Indian girl-friend, who had come\nlike myself from the city, would one day find and bring to me my amulet; past\nthe village school, where twelve or fifteen tousle-headed urchins were\nlearning the three R\'s with the mud floor for writing-surf ace; past the\nconfectioners\' shops, with the fishes and peacocks cut in brass swinging in a\nrow along the front for sign-boards. We had reached the very thickest part of\nthe modest traffic, and had swung recklessly round the corner to the right,\nwhen, a few paces down the street we were leaving on one side, we caught sight\nof a girl\n\np. 111\n\nstanding--tall, starry-eyed, and queenly. Her age may have been eighteen or\ntwenty. She was dressed in green, and stood there--sky and temple in the\nbackground--with the frank look of a child, entirely unconscious of\nobservation. But her arms held the long stems, while the white buds slept\nagainst each shoulder, of two great sheaves of water-lilies.\n\nSo buying and selling and eating and clothing are not the whole life of Silao.\nIt was another proof, could one have been so foolish as to need more, that no\npoet from the city can ever gaze so deep as the farm and forest folk\nthemselves into the beauty of Nature. For these blossoms had been gathered but\nan hour before, from the ponds among the rice-fields. They are the commonest\nwild things of that peasant world, where they are known as "the lovers of the\nmoon," because they open at nightfall--unlike the lordly lotus, who watches\nopen-eyed the footsteps of the sun. And here they were offered for sale by one\nwho had looked into their golden hearts and known their loveliness, to any who\nmight be fain to lay flowers and prayers at the feet of God in the temple\nbeyond. The green-clad woman with her lilies stood in the busy market-place,\nas the silent incarnation of the call to morning worship.\n\nO sane and simple life of the Indian villages, firm-poised betwixt the Unseen\nand the Seen! is\n\np. 112\n\nit of this my amulet would speak to me? Coming from some other peasant woman,\nin all likelihood dead and gone, is the message that her lips too would utter\nthrough it if they could, this same, of priest and chant and worshipper, and\nof some tiny tabernacle, shadowed and lily-strewn and cool, that stands in an\nIndian village as the place of morning-prayer?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: King Parikshit and the Frog Maiden](seh21.htm)\n\n'
