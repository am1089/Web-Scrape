Not the\nmultitudes of gods, nor the great sages know my source; for I am in every way\n3 the origin of the gods and great sages. Of (all) mortals, he who knows me to\nbe unborn, without beginning, the great lord of the world, being free from\ndelusion, is released from all sins. Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from\ndelusion, forgiveness, truth, restraint of the senses, tranquillity, pleasure,\npain, birth, death, fear, and also security, harmlessness, equability,\ncontentment, penance, (making) gifts, glory, disgrace, all these different\ntempers 4 of living beings are from me alone. The seven great sages, and\nlikewise the four ancient Manus 5, whose descendants are (all) these people in\nthe world, were all born from my\n\np. 87\n\nmind 1, (partaking) of my powers. Whoever correctly knows these powers and\nemanations of mine, becomes possessed of devotion free from indecision; of\nthis (there is) no doubt. The wise, full of love 2, worship me, believing that\nI am the origin of all, and that all moves on through me. (Placing their)\nminds on me, offering (their) lives to me, instructing each other, and\nspeaking about me, they are always contented and happy. To these, who are\nconstantly devoted, and who worship with love,, I give that knowledge by which\nthey attain to me. And remaining in their hearts, I destroy, with the\nbrilliant lamp of knowledge, the darkness born of ignorance in such (men)\nonly, out of compassion for them.\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nYou are the supreme Brahman, the supreme goal, the holiest of the holy. All\nsages, as well as the divine sage Narada, Asita 3, Devala, and Vyasa, call you\nthe eternal being, divine, the first god, the unborn, the all-pervading. And\nso, too, you tell me yourself, O Kesava! I believe all this that you tell me\n(to be) true; for, O lord! neither the gods nor demons understand your\nmanifestation 4. You only know your self by your self. O best of beings!\ncreator of all things! lord of all things! god of gods! lord of the universe!\nbe pleased to declare without, exception your divine emanations, by which\nemanations\n\np. 88\n\nyou stand pervading all these worlds. How shall I know you, O you of mystic\npower! always meditating on you? And in what various entities 1, O lord!\nshould I meditate on you? Again, O Ganardana! do you yourself declare your\npowers and emanations; because hearing this nectar, I (still) feel no satiety.\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nWell then, O best of Kauravas! I will state to you my own divine emanations;\nbut (only) the chief (ones), for there is no end to the extent of my\n(emanations). I am the self, O Gu _d_ akesa! seated in the hearts of all\nbeings 2. I am the beginning and the middle and the end also of all beings. I\nam Vish _n_ u among the \xc3\x82dityas 3, the beaming sun among the shining (bodies);\nI am Mari _k_ i among the Maruts 4, and the moon among the lunar mansions 5.\nAmong the Vedas, I am the Sama-veda 6. I am Indra among the gods. And I am\nmind among the senses 7. I am consciousness in (living) beings. And I am _S_ a\n_n_ kara 8 among the Rudras, the lord of wealth 9 among Yakshas and Rakshases.\nAnd I am fire among the Vasus, and Meru 10 among the high-topped (mountains).\nAnd know me, O Ar _g_ una! to\n\np. 89\n\nbe B _ri_ haspati, the chief among domestic priests. I am Skanda among\ngenerals. I am the ocean among reservoirs of water 1. I am Bh _ri_ gu among\nthe great sages. I am the single syllable (Om  2) among words. Among\nsacrifices I am the _G_ apa sacrifice 3; the Himalaya among the firmly-fixed\n(mountains); the A _s_ vattha 4 among all trees, and Narada among divine\nsages; _K_ itraratha among the heavenly choristers, the sage Kapila among the\nSiddhas 5. Among horses know me to be U _kk_ ai _ss_ ravas 6, brought forth by\n(the labours for) the nectar; and Airavata among the great elephants, and the\nruler. of men among men 7. I am the thunderbolt among weapons, the wish-giving\n(cow) among cows. And I am love which generates 8. Among serpents I am Vasuki.\nAmong Naga 9 snakes I am Ananta; I am Varu _n_ a among aquatic beings. And I\nam Aryaman among the manes, and Yama 10 among rulers. Among demons, too, I am\nPralhada. I am the king of death (Kala, time) among those that count 11. Among\nbeasts I\n\np. 90\n\nam the lord of beasts, and the son of Vinata 1 among birds. I am the wind\namong those that blow 2. I am Rama 3 among those that wield weapons. Among\nfishes I am Makara 4, and among streams the _G_ ahnavi 5. Of created things I\nam the beginning and the end and the middle also, O Ar _g_ una! Among\nsciences, I am the science of the Adhyatma, and I am the argument of\ncontroversialists. Among letters I am the letter A 6, and among the group of\ncompounds the copulative 7 compound. I myself am time inexhaustible, and I the\ncreator whose faces are in all directions. I am death who seizes all, and the\nsource of what is to be. And among females, fame 8, fortune, speech, memory,\nintellect, courage. forgiveness. Likewise among Saman hymns, I am the B _ri_\nhat-saman 9, and I the Gayatri 10 among metres. I am Marga _s_ irsha among the\nmonths, the spring\n\np. 91\n\namong the seasons 1; of cheats, I am the game of dice; I am the glory of the\nglorious, I am victory, I am industry, I am the goodness of the good. I am\nVasudeva among the descendants of V _ri_ sh _ni_  2, and Ar _g_ una among the\nPa _nd_ avas. Among sages also, I am Vyasa 3; and among the discerning ones, I\nam the discerning U _s_ anas 4. I am the rod of those that restrain, and the\npolicy 5 of those that desire victory. I am silence respecting secrets. I am\nthe knowledge of those that have knowledge And, O Ar _g_ una! I am also that\nwhich is the seed of all things. There is nothing movable or immovable which\ncan exist without me. O terror of your foes! there is no end to my divine\nemanations. Here I have declared the extent of (those) emanations only in\npart. Whatever thing (there is) of power, or glorious, or splendid, know all\nthat to be produced from portions of my energy. Or rather, O Ar _g_ una! what\nhave you to do, knowing all this at large? I stand supporting all this by\n(but) a single portion (of myself) 6.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[86:1](sbe0811.htm#fr_342) Cf.
