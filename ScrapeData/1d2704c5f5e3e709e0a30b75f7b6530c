For Gods and for  \nPrajapati, O Brahman,  \nWill I tie up the horse. Thence may I prosper! Binding  \nhim for Prajapati and Gods be thou successful.  \n5 Thee welcome to Prajapati I sprinkle. I sprinkle thee  \nwelcome to Indra-Agni. I sprinkle thee acceptable to Vayu.  \nThee welcome to the All-Gods I besprinkle. Thee  \nwelcome to all Deities I sprinkle.  \nWith fury Varuna attacks the man who fain would slay the  \nsteed.  \nAvaunt the man! Avaunt the dog!\n\np. 206\n\n6 To Agni Hail! To Soma Hail!
