You are quite right, my friend. For see!\n\nThe trees, like merchants, show their wares;  \nEach several tree his blossoms bears,  \nWhile bees, like officers, are flitting,  \nTo take from each what toll is fitting.1\n\n_Maitreya_. This simple stone is very attractive. Pray be seated.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Seats himself_.] How Vardham\xc4\x81naka lingers, my friend!\n\n_Maitreya_. I told Vardham\xc4\x81naka to bring Vasantasen\xc4\x81 and come as quickly as he\ncould.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Why then does he linger?\n\nIs he delayed by some slow-moving load?  \n  Has he returned with broken wheel or traces?  \nObstructions bid him seek another road?  \n  His bullocks, or himself, choose these slow paces?2\n\n[ _Enter Vardham \xc4\x81naka with the bullock-cart, in which Aryaka lies hidden_.]\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. Get up, bullocks, get up!\n\n_Aryaka_. [ _Aside_.]\n\nAnd still I fear the spies that serve the king;  \nEscape is even yet a doubtful thing,  \nWhile to my foot these cursed fetters cling.\n\nSome good man \xc2\x92tis, within whose cart I lie,  \nLike cuckoo chicks, whose heartless mothers fly,  \nAnd crows must rear the fledglings, or they die.3\n\nI have come a long distance from the city. Shall I get out of the\n\np. 106\n\ncart and seek a hiding-place in the grove? or shall I wait to see the owner of\nthe cart? On second thoughts, I will not hide myself in the grove; for men say\nthat the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta is ever helpful to them that seek his protection. I\nwill not go until I have seen him face to face.\n\n\xc2\x92Twill bring contentment to that good man's heart  \nTo see me rescued from misfortune's sea.  \nThis body, in its suffering, pain, and smart,  \nIs saved through his sweet magnanimity.4\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. Here is the garden. I'll drive in. [ _He does so_.] Maitreya!\n\n_Maitreya_. Good news, my friend. It is Vardham\xc4\x81naka's voice. Vasantasen\xc4\x81 must\nhave come.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Good news, indeed.\n\n_Maitreya_. You son of a slave, what makes you so late?\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. Don't get angry, good Maitreya. I remembered that I had\nforgotten the cushion, and I had to go back for it, and that is why I am late.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Turn the cart around, Vardham\xc4\x81naka. Maitreya, my friend, help\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 to get out.\n\n_Maitreya_. Has she got fetters on her feet, so that she can't get out by\nherself? [ _He rises and lifts the curtain of the cart_.] Why, this isn't\nmistress Vasantasen\xc4\x81\xc2\x97this is Mister Vasantasena.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. A truce to your jests, my friend. Love cannot wait. I will help\nher to get out myself. [ _He rises_.]\n\n_Aryaka_. [ _Discovers him_.] Ah, the owner of the bullock-cart! He is\nattractive not only to the ears of men, but also to their eyes. Thank heaven!\nI am safe.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Enters the bullock-cart and discovers Aryaka_.] Who then is\nthis?\n\nAs trunk of elephant his arms are long,  \nHis chest is full, his shoulders broad and strong, p. 107  \n  His great eyes restless-red; 1  \nWhy should this man be thus enforced to fight\xc2\x97  \nSo noble he\xc2\x97with such ignoble plight,  \n  His foot to fetters wed?5\n\nWho are you, sir?\n\n_Aryaka_. I am one who seeks your protection, Aryaka, by birth a herdsman.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Are you he whom King P\xc4\x81laka took from the hamlet where he lived\nand thrust into prison?\n\n_Aryaka_. The same.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. \xc2\x92Tis fate that brings you to my sight;\n\nMay I be reft of heaven's light,  \nEre I desert you in your hapless plight.6\n\n[ _Aryaka manifests his joy_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Vardham\xc4\x81naka, remove the fetters from his foot.\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. Yes, sir. [ _He does so_.] Master, the fetters are removed.\n\n_Aryaka_. But you have bound me with yet stronger fetters of love.\n\n_Maitreya_. Now you may put on the fetters yourself. He is free anyway. And\nit's time for us to be going.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Peace! For shame!\n\n_Aryaka_. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, my friend, I entered your cart somewhat unceremoniously.\nI beg your pardon.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. I feel honored that you should use no ceremony with me.\n\n_Aryaka_. If you permit it, I now desire to go.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Go in peace.\n\n_Aryaka_. Thank you. I will alight from the cart.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. No, my friend. The fetters have but this moment been removed,\nand you will find walking difficult. In this spot\n\np. 108\n\nwhere men seek pleasure, a bullock-cart will excite no suspicion. Continue\nyour journey then in the cart.\n\n_Aryaka_. I thank you, sir.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_. Seek now thy kinsmen. Happiness be thine!\n\n_Aryaka_. Ah, I have found thee, blessed kinsman mine!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_. Remember me, when thou hast cause to speak.\n\n_Aryaka_. Thy name, and not mine own, my words shall seek.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_. May the immortal gods protect thy ways!\n\n_Aryaka_. Thou didst protect me, in most perilous days.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_. Nay, it was fate that sweet protection lent.\n\n_Aryaka_. But thou wast chosen as fate's instrument.7\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. King P\xc4\x81laka is aroused, and protection will prove difficult.\nYou must depart at once.\n\n_Aryaka_. Until we meet again, farewell.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_. From royal wrath I now have much to fear;\n\nIt were unwise for me to linger here.  \nThen throw the fetters in the well; for spies  \nServe to their king as keen, far-seeing eyes.8\n\n[ _His left eye twitches_.] Maitreya, my friend, I long to see Vasantasen\xc4\x81.\nFor now, because\n\nI have not seen whom I love best,  \nMy left eye twitches; and my breast  \nIs causeless-anxious and distressed.9\n\nCome, let us go. [ _He walks about_.] See! a Buddhist monk approaches, and the\nsight bodes ill. [ _Reflecting_.] Let him enter by that path, while we depart\nby this.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[107:1](lcc13.htm#fr_70) Lall\xc4\x81d\xc4\xabkshita says that these are signs of royalty.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act the Eighth: The Strangling of Vasantasen\xc4\x81](lcc14.htm)\n\n"
