Killing a Kshatriya or Vai _s_ ya engaged in a sacrifice, or a woman in\nher courses, or a pregnant woman, or a woman (of the Brahma _n_ a caste) who\nhas bathed after temporary uncleanness[1], or an embryo\n\n[5. \'Intercourse of marriage\' means sexual connection with an outcasted man or\nwoman, or giving a damsel in marriage to an outcasted man, \'Intercourse in\nsacrificing\' means sacrificing for, or with, an outcast. \'Mouthly intercourse\'\nmeans teaching, or being taught by, or studying together with, an outcast. The\npresent rule holds good in cases of voluntary intercourse only; if the\nintercourse was involuntary, the loss of caste does not follow till after a\nyear. Others assert that the immediate loss of caste is entailed by\nparticularly intimate intercourse only. (Nand.)\n\nXXXVI. 1. M. XI, 88; Y. III, 251; \xc3\x82past. I, 9, 24, 6, 8, 9.--2-7. M. XI,\n57-59, 171, 172; Y. III, 228-233.--2. Gaut. XXI, 10.--5. Gaut. XXI, I.--7.\n\xc3\x82past. I, 7, 21, 9.\n\n1\\. I The term atreyi (atrigotra) has been translated here and in {footnote p.\n134} other places in accordance with that interpretation which is sanctioned\nby the majority among the commentators of law works. Nand., on the other hand,\ngives the preference to the opinion of those who tender it by \'a woman\ndescended from or married to a man of the race of Atri.\']\n\np. 134\n\nof unknown sex, or one come for protection, are crimes equal to the crime of\nkilling a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n2\\. Giving false evidence and killing a friend: these two crimes are equal to\nthe drinking of spirituous liquor.\n\n3\\. Appropriating to one\'s self land belonging to a Brahma _n_ a or a deposit\n(belonging to a Brahma _n_ a and not consisting of gold) are crimes equal to a\ntheft of gold (belonging to a Brahma _n_ a).\n\n4\\. Sexual connection with the wife of a paternal uncle, of a maternal\ngrandfather, of a maternal uncle, of a father-in-law, or of the king, are\ncrimes equal to sexual connection with a Guru\'s wife;\n\n5\\. And so is sexual intercourse with the father\'s or mother\'s sister and with\none\'s own sister;\n\n6\\. And sexual connection with the wife of a learned Brahma _n_ a, or a\npriest, or an Upadhyaya, or a friend;\n\n7\\. And with a sister\'s female friend (or with one\'s own female friend), with\na woman of one\'s own race, with a woman belonging to the Brahma _n_ a caste,\nwith a (Brahma _n_ a) maiden (who is not yet betrothed to a man), with a low-\ncaste woman, with a woman in her courses, with a woman come for protection,\n\n[2. \'The term etau, "these," is used in order to include the forgetting of\nVeda texts and other crimes, which are mentioned as equal to drinking\nspirituous liquor by Manu (XI, 57) and Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya (III, 229).\' (Nand.)\n\n5\\. \'The particle _k_ a in this Sutra refers to little girls, as ordained by\nManu, XI, 59.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 131\n\nwith a female ascetic, and with a woman entrusted to one\'s own care.\n\n8\\. Such minor offenders become pure, like mortal sinners, by a horse-\nsacrifice and by visiting Tirthas.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXXVII.](sbe07039.htm)\n\n'
