O ye worshipful, your company of Maruts is fond of honey, they who delight\nin their strength at the sacrifices, the Maruts, who shake even the wide\nheaven and earth, and fill the well, when they move about, the terrible ones.\n\n2\\. Truly the Maruts find out the man who praises them, and guide the thoughts\nof the sacrificer. Sit down then to rejoice to-day, on the altar\n[1](sbe3247.htm#an_7:57:2:1) in our assemblies [2](sbe3247.htm#an_7:57:2:2)\nwell pleased.\n\n3\\. Others do not shine so much as these Maruts with their golden chains,\ntheir weapons, and their own bodies; the all-adorned, adorning heaven and\nearth, brighten themselves with the same brightness, when starting for\ntriumph.\n\n4\\. May your shining thunderbolt be far from us, O Maruts, whatever sin we may\ncommit against you, men as we are: O worshipful, let us not fall under\n[1](sbe3247.htm#an_7:57:4:1) its power, let your best favour rest on us.\n\n5\\. May the Maruts be pleased with whatever little we have done here, they the\nfaultless, the bright, the pure. Protect us, ye worshipful, with your favours,\nlead us to prosperity through booty.\n\n6\\. And let the manly Maruts, when they have been praised, under whatever\nnames, enjoy these offerings! Grant that our offspring may not die\n[1](sbe3247.htm#an_7:57:6:1), raise up for us riches\n[2](sbe3247.htm#an_7:57:6:2), glory, and wealth.\n\n7\\. O Maruts, when you have thus been praised, come all together with help\ntowards our lords who with their hundredfold wealth freely prosper\nus;--protect us always with your favours!\n\np. 380\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Vasish _th_ a. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS.,\nTB., MS. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nThis hymn has been translated by Geldner and Kaegi. The first verse is most\ndifficult. G.-K. avoid all difficulties by translating, 'Beim Fest des sussen\nTrankes weiss man tuchtig euch zu begeistern, hehre Schaar der Marut.' Ludwig\ngrapples with them by translating; 'An eures madhu kraft, o zu vererende,\nfreut bei den opfern sich der Marut geschlecht.' I doubt, however, whether _s_\navas is ever ascribed to madhu, though it is ascribed to Soma. Oldenberg\nsuggests, 'The sweet ones' is your Marut-name, O worshipful, they who rejoice\nin their strength at the sacrifices.' Here the difficulty would be that\nMarutam nama is the recognised term for the name, i. e. the kin of the Maruts.\nStill, unless we venture on a conjecture, this would seem to be the best\nrendering. Could we change madhva _h_ va _h_ na\xc2\xb4ma ma\xc2\xb4rutam into madhvad va\n_h_ na\xc2\xb4ma ma\xc2\xb4rutam? Madhvad is a Vedic word, though it occurs once only, in I,\n164, 22, and as trisyllabic. Its very rarity would help to account for the\nchange. The meaning would then be, 'your Marut kin eats honey, is fond of\nhoney.'\n\nIt has been proved that the present madati is always neutral, meaning to\nrejoice, while mand (Par.) is transitive, to make rejoice. Otherwise madhva\n_h_ might possibly have been taken in the sense of sweet things, as in I, 180,\n4; IX, 89, 3, and construed with madanti.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Barhis, which I translate by altar, is the simplest form of an altar,\nmere turf or ku _s_ a-grass, on which the offerings are placed. See note to\nVII, 46, 4.\n\nNote 2. On vidatha, see my note, V, 59, 2.\n\np. 381\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nSee Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 241; his rendering would be acceptable but for the\na. Without any verb of motion a ra _g_ as can hardly mean 'through the air,'\nnor a\xc2\xb4 rodasi 'through the worlds.'\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. On api bhu and api as, see B.-R. s. v.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Am _ri_ ta cannot be rendered by immortality in our sense, it simply\nmeans not dying.\n\nNote 2. _G_ ig _ri_ ta, imp. aor. caus. of gar. Raya _h_ , acc. plur.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 58.
