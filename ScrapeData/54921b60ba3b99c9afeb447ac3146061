D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n#### XVI. The Advaita-Makaranda of Lakshm\xc4\xabdhara 3\n\n1\\. Homage to K\xe1\xb9\x9bish\xe1\xb9\x87a of infinite bliss, the incarnate blessing of the world,\nwho by the sunbeams\n\np. 102\n\nof his glances evaporates the ocean of delusion!\n\n2\\. Always I 1 am, I give light; never am I unbeloved; thus I am proved to be\nBrahma, consisting in Being, Thought, and Bliss.\n\n3\\. In me, the sky of Thought, arises the mirage of the universe 2; then how\ncan I be aught but Brahma, knowing all, cause of all?\n\n4\\. Destruction cannot come upon me from myself, because of my recognition;\nnor from anything else, for I have no parts; nor from the destruction of an\n[external] basis, for I have no such basis. 3\n\n5\\. I, the ether of Thought, cannot be dried, burned, soaked, or cut even by\nreal wind, fire, water, or weapons, much less by imaginary ones. 4\n\n6\\. The universe, having no light of its own,\n\np. 103\n\ncould not possibly come to light but for the presence of light; I am the\nLight, and therefore am everywhere. 1\n\n7\\. Without manifestation there can be no Being, without consciousness there\ncan be no manifestation of the unconscious, and without transference there can\nbe no union with consciousness. Thus I have none beside me. 2\n\n8\\. I am not body, nor organ of sense, nor vital function, nor mind, nor\nintelligence; for they are embraced by the idea of "mine" and are a playground\nfor the conception of "this." 3\n\n9\\. I am the Witness, related to all things, most\n\np. 104\n\ndear; I am never the Ego, for that is plunged in affections, limitations, and\npains. 1\n\n10\\. When the Ego is [dreamlessly] slumbering, sorrow, guilt, and activity do\nnot appear; thus it is he who wanders, not I, who am the wanderer\'s witness. 2\n\n11\\. The sleeper 3 knows not his sleeping; in him who sleeps not there is no\ndreaming and no waking. I am the Witness of waking, dreaming, and dreamless\nsleep, and thus am not under these conditions.\n\n12\\. [Dreamless] sleep is a halting of [finite] understanding, dreaming and\nwaking are the rise thereof; how can these three exist in me, who am the\nWitness of them and infinite of knowledge?\n\np. 105\n\n13\\. I am the one who knows the beings of sixfold change, 1 and myself\nchangeless; were it not so, I should be altogether incapable of observing\ntheir changes.\n\n14\\. For a changing thing goes again and again through birth and dissolution\nin this and that form; how can it be an observer of these [changes]?\n\n15\\. Nor can any one behold his own birth and destruction; for these are\n[respectively] the last and first moments of antecedent and subsequent non-\nbeing. 2\n\n16\\. How can the not-Light touch the Self which is Light itself, and by whose\nlight alone are caused the words, "I give not light"? 3\n\n17\\. Nevertheless there is apparent in the sky\n\np. 106\n\nof Thought a certain mist which subsists on the lack of reflection and ends\nwith the rise of the sun of reflection. 1\n\n18\\. In this long-drawn dream of which our world is made, and which arises\nfrom the great slumber of Self-ignorance, there appear Heaven, Salvation, and\nthe other phantoms. 2\n\n19\\. This distinction between unconscious and conscious being is imaginarily\nimposed on me, the conscious being, like the distinction between moving and\nmotionless figures in a picture on a level wall.\n\n20\\. Even my Witnesshood is unreal, is but a colouring reflected from the\nobjects of thought; it merely suggests the billowless ocean of Thought. 3\n\n21\\. I, the ocean of ambrosia, decay not because phantom bubbles arise; I, the\nmountain of crystal, am not flushed by the play of dream-fashioned evening\nclouds. 4\n\np. 107\n\n22\\. _Being_ is my very essence, not a property, like ether\'s being; for as\nthere is no Being save me, no class-concept [of Being] can be allowed. 1\n\n23\\. _Knowledge_ is my very essence, not a quality; if it were a quality,\n[Soul] would be if intelligible not-Self, and if unintelligible non-being. 2\n\n24\\. _Bliss_ am I, which is naught else [but me]; were it aught else, it would\nnot be bliss; for if not subordinate to me, it would not be agreeable, and if\nsubordinate, it could not be of itself agreeable.\n\n25\\. No real thing forsooth can ever be of diverse essences; thus I am without\ninward distinction, void of the differences arising from the world.\n\n26\\. By the words "That art thou" is indicated a Power of single essence, pure\nby the absence of the variety [consisting in] the transcendence [of\n\np. 108\n\nthe Supreme] and the distinction [of individual souls]. 1\n\n27\\. I am the Power self-authoritative and absolute, in which are stilled the\nphantom figures of the world and separate souls, of disciples and masters.\n\n28\\. May this "Nectar of Monism" of the poet Lakshm\xc4\xabdhara, gathered from the\nautumnal lotuses of poesy, be drunk by the scholar-bees.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[101:1](brk43.htm#fr_72) See above, \xc2\xa7 4.\n\n[101:2](brk43.htm#fr_73) The light of the sun; \xe1\xb9\x9aig-veda, III. lxii. 10\n\n[101:3](brk44.htm#fr_74) This is a somewhat modern poem, which is here added\nas it conveys with great clearness the leading psychological doctrines of the\nlater Ved\xc4\x81nt.\n\n[102:1](brk44.htm#fr_75) Throughout this little work the pronoun "I" is used\nto denote the individual soul as witness of the sense of personality, ( _aha\n\xe1\xb9\x83-k\xc4\x81ra,_ egoity), and the other "determinations" of soul, while itself it\nconsciously transcends them. The verse means that as the same predicates--\nexistence, thought, and agreeableness--apply both to the soul and to Brahma,\nthese two are identical.\n\n[102:2](brk44.htm#fr_76) See above, \xc2\xa7 16.\n\n[102:3](brk44.htm#fr_77) The soul is eternal; for it cannot be destroyed from\nwithin, since it has self-recognition, i.e. continuous consciousness of self-\nidentity; and it cannot be destroyed from without, for as it has no parts it\ncannot be dissolved into its parts; and as it is dependent upon nothing but\nitself it cannot suffer from the destruction of its basis.\n\n[102:4](brk44.htm#fr_78) The physical elements, which seem real, are in truth\nimaginary.\n\n[103:1](brk44.htm#fr_79) In the process of cognition, according to the\nVed\xc4\x81nta, there are two elements--viz. the object or matter of the cognition\nand the subject of it. The former, being wholly lifeless and inert, can only\nemerge into consciousness when the light of subject Thought falls upon it from\nwithout. The first word of this verse, _abh \xc4\x81-r\xc5\xabpasya,_ is wrongly printed _\xc4\x81\nbh\xc4\x81r\xc5\xabpasya_ and accordingly mistranslated in the "Pandit" of 1873, pp. 11,\n130.\n\n[103:2](brk44.htm#fr_80) No object exists unless it becomes cognised--i.e. it\nbecomes the object of a subject conscious thereof. Thus conscious being enters\ninto relation with unconscious being; and how is this possible? It can only be\nexplained by assuming an _adhy \xc4\x81sa_ or "transference," an inveterate error of\nthe individual consciousness making it identify itself with the phenomenal\nworld, which is properly nothing more than an unreal emanation of the\nconsciousness. Hence there exists in reality nothing but consciousness. See\n\xc5\x9aankara on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra, i. 1.\n\n[103:3](brk44.htm#fr_81) The sense-organs _(indriya)_ , vital functions _(pr\n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a)_, sensorium _(manas)_ , and intelligence _(dh \xc4\xab,_ i.e. _buddhi)_ , are\nonly "determinants," _up \xc4\x81dhis,_ external to the soul; see p. 28 f.\n\n[104:1](brk44.htm#fr_82) The "witness" is the consciousness impassively\ncognising the affections of the psychical _up \xc4\x81dhis,_ such as love or hate. It\nis "related to all things," for things exist only in so far as they are\nobjects of thought (see v. 7). It is thus universal Being, Thought, and Bliss.\nOn the error of confusing the absolute Self with the Ego, see p. 45. The Ego\n_(aha \xe1\xb9\x83-k\xc4\x81ra)_ is really the subject of dreaming and dreamless sleep and\nwaking, not the transcendental Self, according to the later, Ved\xc4\x81nta.\n\n[104:2](brk44.htm#fr_83) In deep sleep or swoons the Ego or sense of\npersonality disappears and with it disappear its resultant activities and\naffections; hence the _sa \xe1\xb9\x83s\xc4\x81ra,_ or continuance of rebirth, which consists\nessentially of these activities, cannot co-exist with the absence of the Ego,\ni.e. with the condition of abstract impersonal self-consciousness.\n\n[104:3](brk44.htm#fr_84) The Ego, or sense of personality, which in dreamless\nsleep is unconscious that it is sleeping. On the other hand the transcendental\nSoul or Self is everlastingly conscious; it is the "Witness" of the three\nstates.\n\n[105:1](brk44.htm#fr_85) The six changes of finite being are origin,\ncontinuance, increase, attainment of maturity, commencement of decay, and\ndissolution. As subject of the cognition of these phenomena, the Soul must be\nitself devoid of these properties.\n\n[105:2](brk44.htm#fr_86) If the Soul were liable to changes, it would be\nconscious of its changes, which is not the case (verse 14). Every change of a\nthing implies destruction of its previous condition; hence, even if we could\nimagine soul as passing through the six changes, we should have to admit that\nwhen it is in a particular state it cannot as such be conscious of itself at\nthe beginning of that state (which is the last moment of the previous state),\nnor can it be conscious of itself at the end of that state (which is the first\nmoment of the next state).\n\n[105:3](brk44.htm#fr_87) The illusion of a phenomenal world cannot be in any\nreal connection with the pure consciousness of the absolute Soul; for the\nconception of a physical world opposed to thought is essentially a partial\nnegation of consciousness by consciousness, and nothing more.\n\n[106:1](brk44.htm#fr_88) The illusion of the phenomenal world, which falsely\nappears as really existent, until its unreality is proved by "reflection."\n\n[106:2](brk44.htm#fr_89) Even salvation, or release of the Soul _(moksha)_ ,\nis only real from the standpoint of empiric thought. The transcendent Self is\nnever in bondage, and therefore is never released.\n\n[106:3](brk44.htm#fr_90) Since the objects of finite Thought are strictly\nunreal, there cannot be a _real_ consciousness of them in the real Self. The\nfunction of witness of phenomena which apparently is exercised by the Self is\nreally a mere indication of the absolute supra-phenomenal immobility of\nconsciousness which is characteristic of the real Self.\n\n[106:4](brk44.htm#fr_91) The essential nature of the Soul is in no way\naffected byp. 107 the emergence from it of an imaginary universe, nor by the\nfalse idea, reflected upon it from the illusory universe without, that it is a\nsubject or object of action, etc.\n\n[107:1](brk44.htm#fr_92) We must not say that "existence" is only a property\nor attribute of the Soul. For an attribute is a generic concept implying more\nthan one individual in which it resides; but in the case of Soul there is only\none individual, the Soul itself, in which resides the attribute "existence,"\nin the same way as in the phenomenal world there is only one ether, or space,\nin which therefore "etherhood" is essence, not attribute.\n\n[107:2](brk44.htm#fr_93) If the Self is an object to its assumed property of\nknowledge, it is no longer Self; for the object of knowledge cannot be\nidentical with the subject (which here is the property of knowledge). If again\nthe Self is not an object of its know ledge, the Self is non-existent; for the\nincogitable is unreal.\n\n[108:1](brk44.htm#fr_94) See Appendix I.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Appendix I: The Sambandhas](brk45.htm)\n\n'
