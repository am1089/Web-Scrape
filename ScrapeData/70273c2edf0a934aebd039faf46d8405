Shree Shookdeo Jee replied,--O great king! the lord, who is the\nauthor of the intellect, of the organs of action and perception, of the mind,\nsoul, religious and moral merit, wealth, desire and salvation, constantly\nremains in a passionless form, without human qualities, but when he creates\nthe world, he is possessed of all qualities, and assumes his own natural form;\nfor this reason, that one [deity](errata.htm#28) is both without, and with\npassions and qualities.\n\nHaving thus said, Shookdeo, the sage, added, Raja! Narud Jee on one occasion\nasked Nurnarain the question you have now asked me. Raja Pureechit said, "O\ngreat king! please explain this subject to me, that the perplexities of my\nmind may be removed."\n\nShookdeo Jee replied, Raja! once on a time during the age of truth, Narud Jee\nwent into the world of truth (that is, the world of the virtuous age) to the\nplace where Nurnarain was sitting engaged with many other sages in devout\nreligious austerities, and enquired, "O great king? be pleased to do me the\n\np. 426\n\nfavour to say, how the Vedas glorify the incorporeal Bruhm." Nurnarain said,\n"Hear me Narud! the perplexity, which you have asked me to explain, is the\nsame as occurred in the world of mortals, at a place where Sunatun and other\nsages were seated, occupied with religious penance. Sunundun, a sage, then\nnarrated a story, and entirely removed the doubts of all present." Narud Jee\nsaid, "O great king! I also dwell there, and if this story had been told, I\nshould have heard it." Nurnarain said, "Narud Jee! this story was told, when\nyou had gone to the white island to visit Bhugwut and, therefore, you did not\nhear it." Having heard this, Narud Jee said, "O great king! kindly inform me\nwhat story was related there," Nurnarain replied, "Listen! Narud, when the\nsages asked this question, Sunundun, the saint, began to say to them, \'Listen\nto me! at the time of the general destruction, when fourteen worlds became the\nsemblence of water, then the complete Bruhm remained alone asleep, when\nBhugwan wished to create the world, the Vedas having come forth from his\nbreath and joined their hands, sang praises to him, just as bards, by singing\nsongs of eulogy of his renown very early in the morning, might awaken a Raja,\nwho was asleep in his own house; in order, that being awake, he might quickly\nperform any business he had to do.\'"\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the story, Nurnarain added, "Listen to me, O\nNarud! the Vedas having come forth from the mouth of the lord were saying, \'O\nlord! awake quickly and create the world, and remove your deceptive power far\nfrom the minds of animated beings; then they will recognize your appearance;\nyour deceptive power is predominant, and deprives all beings of intelligence;\nthe being who escapes from it, will have knowledge to understand you. O lord!\nno one except you can reduce this power to subjection; he, in whose breast you\ndwell in the form of knowledge, overcomes this deceptive power; otherwise, who\nhas ability to escape from the influence of this power? You are the creator of\nall;\n\np. 427\n\nall animated beings, having derived their origin from you, are contained in\nyou; just as many things being produced from the earth, are again mixed up in\nthe earth; whoever worships or glorifies any god whatsoever, worships and\nglorifies you, just as a man may make many ornaments of gold, and give them\nvarious names, but it is still gold; so you have many forms; and consider this\npoint, that not one of those forms is any thing, and that on what sidesoever\nwe look, there you are presented to our sight. O lord! your deceptive power is\ninfinite; this power becoming the three qualities of truth, passion and\ndarkness; having assumed three forms, and created the universe, preserves and\ndestroys it; no one has discovered its mystery, and no one ever will discover\nit; wherefore, it is right for an animated being to abandon all desires and\nmeditate upon you; his welfare depends upon his doing so.\'"\n\nO great king! having proceeded thus far in his story, Nurnarain said to Narud,\n"Narud! when Sunundun, the sage, having related this history of a former age,\nhad removed the perplexities of all their minds, then Sunuk and the other\nsages offered worship to Sunundun according to the sacred precepts of the\nVedas."\n\nHaving related thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja!\nwhoever shall hear this conversation of Narain and Narud, shall without doubt\nobtain the fulfilment of all his desires, and be saved hereafter. The account\nof the complete Bruhm, which the Vedas sang of, Sunundun, the sage, recited to\nSunuk and other saints, then Nurnarain related it before Narud; and Byas\nobtained it from Narud; and Byas explained it to me, and I have now mentioned\nit to you; whoever shall hear or relate this history, shall obtain whatever\nbenefits he desires, whatever virtue there is in penance, sacrifice, gifts,\nfasting and pilgrimage, there is the same merit in reciting and hearing this\nhistory.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXXVIII](psa89.htm)\n\n'
