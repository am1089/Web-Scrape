Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing the two Demons slain by the Devi, Mahi _s_\nasura became very much amazed and sent the powerful Asiloma and Vi _d_ alak\n_s_ a and the other Danavas to the battle to kill the Devi. The Danavas, all\nvery skilled in the art of warfare, marched on for battle, fully equipped with\nweapons and clad in armour, and we attended by a vast army. They arrived there\nand saw the Divine Mother with eighteen hands taking Her stand on a lion, with\naxes and shield in Her hands.\n\n\n\n4-5. The calm-tempered Asiloma appeared before the Devi ready to kill the\nDaityas, saluted Her and smilingly said :-- O Devi! Why have You come here?\nand what for You are killing these faultless Daityas? O Beautiful One! Tell\nall these to me truly. We will make treaty with you.\n\n\n\n6-17. Take gold, jewels, pearls and any other excellent things the you like\nand retire from the field as early as passible. Why do you like this warfare\ntending to increase misery; the wise persons say that it leads to the\ndestruction of all happiness. Your body is very delicate; it cannot bear the\nstroke of flowers even; then why are you suffering the stroke of weapons on\nyour bodies; I am very much puzzled to think these things. See! The cleverness\nis judged when peace is the result thereof; for it leads always to happiness.\nThen why are you liking to fight which will lead only to pain and suffering.\nHappiness is only to be had and pain is to be avoided; this is the rule. O\nDevi! That happiness is again of two kinds :-- Permanent and transitory. The\npleasure that comes out of the knowledge of Atmaj\xc3\xb1an is permanent and that\nwhich is derived from enjoyments is transitory; these who know truly the Veda\nS\xc2\x92astra, they avoid this transitory pleasure of enjoyments. If you follow the\nopinion of the Mimamsakas and do not believe in the\n\n\n\np. 404\n\n\n\nexistence of future births, even then you ought not to fight; when you have\ngot this youthful age, you ought to enjoy the excellent pleasures in this\nworld. O One of lean stomach! And if you doubt in the existence of the other\nworlds after death, even then you ought to desert from fighting and perform,\nin this life, such actions as will lead you to the attainment of Heavens. This\nfully developed womanhood is transient; knowing this do virtuous actions\nalways; the wise ones always avoid tormenting others; thus one ought to\nperform things not contradictory to Dharma, Artha and Kama. Therefore, O\nAuspicious One! Do You also things virtuous always. O Mother! Why are you\nkilling these Daityas without any cause? There is, again, the feeling of\nmercy; the lives again of all are dependent on Truth. Therefore the sages\nalways preserve piety, mercy and Truth. O Beautiful One! Then what is the use\nin Your killing these Demons? Please say explicitly on this point.\n\n\n\n18-27. The Devi said :-- O Powerful one! Hear why I have come here and why I\nam killing the Daityas? I answer your question on the above points. O Demon!\nI, though merely a spectator, always go about all over the worlds, seeing the\njustices and injustices done by the several souls there. Never I possess any\ndesire of enjoyment, nor have I greed for anything, nor have I enmity with any\ncreature. Only to preserve the virtue and religion and to keep up the\nrighteous, I roam over the worlds. This is My vow and I always adhere to it.\nTo preserve the good and to put down the evil doers is My duty. Many Avataras\nare to take their incarnations, cycles after cycles, to preserve the Vedas;\ntherefore I incarnate Myself in yugas after yugas. Now the wicked Mahi _s_ a\nis ready to destroy the Devas; seeing this, I have come here to kill him. I\ntell you verily that I will slay that vicious powerful Mahi _s_ asura, the\nenemy of the gods. Knowing this, you remain or depart, as you desire. Or you\ncan go to Mahi _s_ a, that impious son of a she-buffalo, and say what is the\nuse in sending other Asuras to the battle; he can come himself and fight. If\nyour king likes to make a treaty, then let him avoid his enmity with the Devas\nand go down to the Patala. Let him return to the Devas whatever he has taken\nperforce from them and go to the Patala, where Prahlada is residing.\n\n\n\n28-29. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the Devi\xc2\x92s words, Asiloma asked\ngladly, before the Devi, the powerful Asura Vi _d_ alak _s_ a :-- Well, Vi _d_\nalak _s_ a! You have heard just now all what the Devi has said; now are we to\nobserve treaty or declare war. What are we to do under the circumstances?\n\n\n\n30-34. Vi _d_ alak _s_ a said :-- Our king knows full well that his death will\ncertainly take place in the battle; knowing this, he is not willing\n\n\n\np. 405\n\n\n\nto make peace, out of his egoism and vanity. He is seeing before him daily the\ndeaths of the Danavas and still he has sent us to battle. Who can overcome the\ndestiny? The duty of a servant is a very difficult one; he will have to be\nalways submissive and obedient, without caring the least for his own self-\nrespect; just as the dancing dolls are completely under the hands of the\nactors and their movements vary according to the pulling of the wires employed\nin making them dance. How can we then go to our master and say such hard words\nas he would give away to the Devas all the gems and jewels and go down to\nPatala with other Danavas. One considers it one\xc2\x92s duty to speak pleasant words\nthough untrue; true words cannot be beneficial; true and at the same time\nbeneficial words are very rare in this world; at such critical cases, one\nought to remain silent. Especially heroes ought never to excite their kings by\nuseless words; this is the essence of politics. We should never go and advise\nour king with eagerness what is best or to ask advice from him about such\nthings; the king would then certainly be very angry. Therefore we ought to do\nour duties to the king, even if our lives be at stake. To consider our lives\nas nothing and to fight for our king are what is best for us.\n\n\n\n35-57. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus thinking, the two heroes then wore their\ncoats of armour, mounted on their chariots and, with bows and arrows in their\nhands, became ready for fight. First Vi _d_ alak _s_ a shot seven arrows; the\ngreat warrior Asiloma stood aloof at a distance as a mere witness. The Divine\nMother cut off those arrows to pieces with Her arrows, no sooner they reached\nHer, and then shot at Vi _d_ alak _s_ a three arrows sharpened on stone. The\ndemon Vidalaksa fell senselss by these arrows on the battle-field and after a\nshort while died, as if ordained by Fate. Seeing Vi _d_ alak _s_ a thus dead,\nAsiloma took up his bows and arrows and came up, for fight. The hero, then,\nraising his left hand, said briefly, thus :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! I know that death is\ninevitable to the Danavas; still I am ready to fight; for I am dependent and\nMahi _s_ a is of very dull intellect; he cannot make any distinction between\nwhat is really good and what is merely pleasant. I will never speak before him\nunpleasant words, though beneficial. Rather I will sacrifice my life in the\nbattle-field than advise him anything, be that auspicious or inauspicious. The\nDanavas are being killed no sooner they are shot at by your arrows; seeing\nthis I consider Fate superior to all. Prowess does not lead to any success;\nFie on one\xc2\x92s prowess! Thus saying, the Demon began to shower arrows after\narrows on the Devi; the Devi, too, cut them to pieces with Her own arrows\nbefore they came to Her; and, becoming angry, soon pierced him with arrows.\nThe Devas witnessed this sight from above. The body of the\n\n\n\np. 406\n\n\n\nDemon was then covered with cuts and wounds; blood began to flow from them;\nthe Demon consequently began to shine like the jovial Kimsuka tree. Asiloma\nthen lifted aloft his heavy iron club and ran after Cha _nd_ ika and hurt the\nlion on his head with anger. Not caring at all this severe stroke of the club\ninflicted by that powerful Demon, the lion tore asunder his arms with his\nclaws. Then that dreadful Demon leapt with club in his hand and got up the\nshoulder of the lion and hit the Devi very hard. O King! The Devi, then,\nbaffled the hit and cut off the Demon\xc2\x92s head with Her sharp axe. The head\nbeing thus severed, the Demon was thrown on the ground with great force;\nseeing this, a general cry of distress arose among his soldiers. The Devas\nshouted aloud \xc2\x93Victory to the Devi\xc2\x94 and chanted hymns to Her. The drums of the\nDevas resounded and the Gandarbhas began to dance in great joy. Seeing the two\nDemons thus lying dead on the battlefield, the lion killed some of the\nremaining forces by his sheer strength and ate up others, and made the\nbattlefield void of any persons. Some fled away in great distress to Mahi _s_\nasura. The fugitives began to cry aloud, \xc2\x93Save us, save us\xc2\x94 and said, \xc2\x93O King!\nAsiloma and Vi _d_ alak _s_ a are both slain; and those soldiers that remained\nwere eaten up by the lion.\xc2\x94 Thus they told and plunged the King in an ocean of\ndire distress. Hearing their words, Mahi _s_ a became absent minded through\npain and grief and began to think over the matter with great anxiety.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifteenth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the slaying of Vi _d_\nalak _s_ a and Asiloma in S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 16](bk05ch16.htm)\n\n'
