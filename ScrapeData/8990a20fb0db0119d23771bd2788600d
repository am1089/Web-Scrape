Now, the Ya _g_ us, indeed, is he who blows here, for even whilst\npassing along he (Vayu, the wind) generates (vivifies) everything here, and\nafter him passing along everything is generated: this is why the Ya _g_ us is\nno other than Vayu.\n\n10:3:5:22\\. And the course 1 ( _g_ u _h_ ) is this space, to wit, this air 2,\nfor along this space it (the wind) courses; and the Ya _g_ us is both the wind\nand the air--the \'yat\' and the \' _g_ u _h_ \'--whence (the name) Ya _g_ us. And\nthe \'yat\' (that which goes) is this (Adhvaiyu) 3, for when he \'goes\' on\n(performing), the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman carry that Ya _g_ us established on the\n_Ri_ _k_ and Saman. Hence the Adhvaryu performs his work with the very same\nGrahas (cups of Soma), (while) there are each time 4 different stotras\n(chants) and _s_ astras (recitations): it is just as if, after driving with a\nfirst pair (of horses), one drives with a second pair.\n\np. 337\n\n10:3:5:33\\. Now Agni is in front 1 (puras), for placing Agni in front (of\nthem) these creatures attend upon him; and the sun is motion ( _k_ ara _n_ a),\nfor as soon as he rises everything here moves about. Such is the Ya _g_ us\nwith the preparatory performance (pura _s_ _k_ ara _n_ a 2) as regards the\ndeities.\n\n10:3:5:44\\. Now as regards the body. The Ya _g_ us is the breath, for whilst\nmoving (yat) it generates (vivifies) everything here, and along with the\nmoving breath birth takes place here: hence the Ya _g_ us is the breath.\n\n10:3:5:55\\. And this course ( _g_ u _h_ ) is space--this space which is inside\nthe body--for along this space it (the breath) courses; and the Ya _g_ us is\nboth the breath and space,--the \'yat\' and the \' _g_ u _h_ \': hence \'ya _g_\nus.\' And the \'yat\' (moving) is the breath, for the breath moves.\n\n10:3:5:66\\. The Ya _g_ us, indeed, is food, for by food one is produced, and\nby food one moves. And food carries along that Ya _g_ us established on food,\nwhence even different food is introduced into the same (channel of the)\nbreath.\n\n10:3:5:77\\. And the Mind is in front (puras), for the mind is the first of\nvital airs; and the eye is motion ( _k_ ara _n_ a), for it is in accordance\nwith the eye that this\n\np. 338\n\nbody moves. Such is the Ya _g_ us with the preparatory performance, firmly\nestablished both as regards the deity and the body; and, indeed, whosoever\nthus knows this Ya _g_ us with the preparatory performance to be firmly\nestablished both as regards the deity and the body,--\n\n10:3:5:88\\. He, indeed, reaches successfully the end of the sacrifice,\nunscathed and uninjured: he who knows this becomes the first, the leader\n(pura-et _ri_ ), of his own people, an eater of food (i.e. prosperous), and a\nruler.\n\n10:3:5:99\\. And if any one strives to become a rival 1 among his own people to\none who knows this, he does not satisfy his dependants; but, indeed, only he\nsatisfies his dependants, who is faithful 2 to that one and who, along with\nhim, strives to support his dependants.\n\n10:3:5:1010\\. And this is the greatest Brahman (n., mystic science), for than\nthis there is no thing greater; and, he who knows this, being himself the\ngreatest, becomes the highest among his own people.\n\n10:3:5:1111\\. This Brahman has nothing before it and nothing after it 3; and\nwhosoever thus knows this Brahman to have nothing before it and nothing\n\np. 339\n\nafter it, than he there is no one higher among his equals in station; and ever\nhigher will be the descendants that spring from him. Wherefore, if any one\nwould be greater than he, let him reverentially approach the regions in front\n(to the eastward) of that one in this way, and he will do him no injury 1.\n\n10:3:5:1212\\. But, indeed, the mystic import (upanishad) is the essence of\nthis Ya _g_ us; and thus, if, with ever so small a ya _g_ us-formula, the\nAdhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, that (essence) is equal to both the Stotra and\nthe _S_ astra, and comes up to both the Stotra and the _S_ astra: hence,\nhowever small the essence (flavour) of food, it benefits (renders palatable)\nthe whole food, and pervades the whole food.\n\n10:3:5:1313\\. Satiation (contentment), doubtless, is the successful issue\nthereof (to wit, of food, and the Ya _g_ us): hence when one is satiated by\nfood he feels like one who has succeeded. And joy, the knowledge thereof (viz.\nof the essence, the mystic import), is its soul (self); and, assuredly, all\nthe gods are of joyful soul; and this, the true knowledge, belongs to the gods\nalone,--and, indeed, whosoever knows this is not a man, but one of the gods.\n\np. 340\n\n10:3:5:1414\\. And Priyavrata Rauhi _n_ ayana, knowing this (truth), once spake\nunto the blowing wind, \'Thy soul 1 is joy: blow thou either hither or\nthither!\' and so, indeed, it now blows. Wherefore, if one desire to invoke any\nblessing from the gods, let him approach them with this, \'Your soul is joy,--\nmy wish is such and such: let it be fulfilled unto me!\' and whatever the wish\nhe entertains, it will be fulfilled to him; for, assuredly, he who knows this\nattains this contentment, this successful issue, this joy, this soul.\n\n10:3:5:1515\\. This Ya _g_ us is silent 2, indistinct; for the Ya _g_ us is the\nbreath, and the breath is of silent (secret) abode; and if any one were to say\nof that (Adhvaryu) who pronounces (the Ya _g_ us) distinctly, \'He has uttered\ndistinctly the indistinct deity: his breath shall fail him!\' then that would,\nindeed, come to pass.\n\n10:3:5:1616\\. And, assuredly, he who knows the indistinct (secret)\nmanifestation of this (Ya _g_ us) becomes manifest in fame and glory. Silently\nthe Adhvaryu draws the cup of Soma with the (muttered) Ya _g_ us, and, when\ndrawn and deposited, it becomes manifest;--silently he builds the fire-altar\nwith the Ya _g_ us, and, when built and completed, it becomes\nmanifest;--silently he takes out (material for) the oblation with the Ya _g_\nus, and, when cooked and ready (for offering), it becomes manifest: thus,\nwhatever he performs silently, when performed and completed, it becomes\nmanifest. And, assuredly, he who thus knows this secret manifestation of this\n\np. 341\n\n[paragraph continues] (Ya _g_ us) becomes manifest in fame, and glory, and\nsanctity; and quickly, indeed, he becomes known: he becomes the Ya _g_ us\nitself, and by the Ya _g_ us people call him 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[336:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_657) \' _G_ u _h_ \' would rather seem to mean \'the\nurger, or speeder.\'\n\n[336:2](sbe4360.htm#fr_658) \'Yad idam antariksham,\' perhaps, with the double\nsense--\'this air is the "yat (the going, moving thing)"\'--made use of in the\nsequel. The construction, however, is not quite clear. Saya _n_ a explains:\nayam evaka _s_ o _g_ ur iti; _g_ u iti sautro dhatur gatyartha _h_ ; yad idam\npratiyamanam antariksham asti tad eva _g_ ur iti; yad evo _k_ yate--etam aka\n_s_ am anulakshya _g_ avate, vayur ga _k_ _kh_ ati, vayu _g_ avamadakara _n_ a\n--tva _g_ _g_ ur aka _s_ a _h_.\n\n[336:3](sbe4360.htm#fr_659) Or, whence (the name) Ya _g_ us, to wit, this\n(Adhvaryu).\n\n[336:4](sbe4360.htm#fr_660) That is, in different Soma-sacrifices.\n\n[337:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_661) Literally, apparently, \'The in-front is Agni.\'\n\n[337:2](sbe4360.htm#fr_662) This term, literally, \'moving in front,\' seems\nvirtually to imply the entire manual work connected with the sacrifice, and\nwhich, along with the muttering of the Ya _g_ us-formulas, forms the official\nduty of the Adhvaryu. It would thus include all the sacrificial performances\nprior to the muttering of a Ya _g_ us, as the finishing or consecratory rite.\nFor a somewhat similar discussion, see IV, 6, 7, 20. 21. The commentary\nintroduces the present discussion thus: atha brahma _n_ aparanamadheyasya pura\n_s_ _k_ ara _n_ a _s_ abdasya purvavan nirva _k_ anapura _h_ saram adhidaivam\nartham aha.\n\n[338:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_663) Or, tries to make opposition, as Saya _n_ a takes\nit--ya _h_ purusha _h_ sveshu madhye eva _m_ vidam uktavidya _m_ _g_ anana _m_\npurusha _m_ pratibubhushati (!) pratikulyam a _k_ aritum i _k_ _kh_ ati.\n\n[338:2](sbe4360.htm#fr_664) Thus \'anu-bhu\' is taken by the St. Petersb. Dict.\n(\'to serve, be helpful to\'), and by Saya _n_ a--\'yas tv eva _m_ vidam\nanukulayet sa poshyan poshayitu _m_ _s_ aknoti.\'\n\n[338:3](sbe4360.htm#fr_665) Saya _n_ a seems to take \'aparavat\' in the sense\nof \'it has (only) something after it\'--srash _t_ avya _g_ agadrupaparavat--and\nthe use of the word \'aparapurusha _h_ (descendants)\' immediately after might\nindeed seem to favour that interpretation.\n\n[339:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_666) The MISS. of the commentary (I. O. 613. 149) are\nunfortunately not in a very satisfactory condition:--sa yo haitad iti, evam\nupasitety artha _h_ ; yadi veditu _h_ saka _s_ at gyayasa _h_ purushasya\nsadbhave tada svayam badhyo bhavatity a _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kya tasmad adhikapurushad\nadhikam (a _kh_ adikat B) [vastu di _s_ yopasitavyam (!) ity aha, yo\xe0\xa4\xbdsma _g_\n_g_ yayan iti; yadi asmad upasakat yo\xe0\xa4\xbddhika _h_ syat tarhi tasmad adhikat, om.\nB] di _s_ a _h_ purva ity upasita; tata _h_ _g_ yayaso\xe0\xa4\xbdpi _g_ yaya-upasane\nsvasyadhikyat badhako nasti _t_ y artha _h_. The commentary would thus seem to\ntake it to mean that by showing reverence to something before, or higher than,\nhis rival, he would turn aside his schemes.\n\n[340:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_667) Or, thine own self, thy nature--tavatma svarupam.\nSaya _n_ a.\n\n[340:2](sbe4360.htm#fr_668) That is, pronounced in an undertone, muttered.\n\n[341:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_669) Ya _g_ ushaivainam a _k_ akshata iti _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ at\n_ri_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ eyayor abhedopa _k_ are _n_ a tasya vidusha eva ya _g_ u _h_\ntasya vyavaharyatvam bhavatity artha _h_.
