And on account of the permanence of this (viz. the embodied soul).\n\nThis embodied soul abides permanently in this body as the enjoyer, since it\ncan be affected by good and evil and can experience pleasure and pain. Not so\nthe gods; for they exist in the state of highest power and glory and cannot\npossibly enter, in this wretched body, into the condition of enjoyers. So\nscripture also says, 'Only what is good approaches him; verily evil does not\napproach the devas' (B _ri_. Up. I, 5. 20).--And only with the embodied soul\nthe pra _n_ as are permanently connected, as it is seen that when the soul\npasses out &c. the pra _n_ as follow it. This we see from passages such as the\nfollowing: 'When it passes out the pra _n_ a passes out after it, and when the\npra _n_ a thus passes out all the other pra _n_ as pass after it' (B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 4, 2). Hence although there are ruling divinities of the organs, the\nembodied soul does not cease to be the enjoyer; for the divinities are\nconnected with the organs only, not with the state of the soul as enjoyer.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 17](sbe38071.htm)\n\n"
