On account of the inferential sign further on, together with _K_\naitraratha.\n\nThe kshattriya-hood of _G_ ana _s_ ruti is further to be accepted on account\nof the Kshattriya Abhipratarin _K_ aitraratha, who is mentioned further on in\nthis very same Sa _m_ vargavidya which Raikva imparts to _G_ ana _s_ ruti.--\nBut why?--As follows. The section beginning 'Once a Brahma _k_ arin\n\np. 342\n\nbegged of Saunaka Kapeya and Abhipratarin Kakshaseni while being waited on at\ntheir meal,' and ending 'thus do we, O Brahma _k_ arin, meditate on that\nbeing,' shows Kapeya, Abhipratarin, and the Brahma _k_ arin to be connected\nwith the Sa _m_ varga-vidya. Now Abhipratarin is a Kshattriya, the other two\nare Brahma _n_ as. This shows that there are connected with the vidya, Brahma\n_n_ as, and from among non-Brahma _n_ as, a Kshattriya only, but not a _S_\nudra. It therefore appears appropriate to infer that the person, other than\nthe Brahma _n_ a Raikva, who is likewise connected with this vidya, viz. _G_\nanasruti, is likewise a Kshattriya, not a _S_ udra.--But how do we know that\nAbhipratarin is a _K_ aitraratha and a Kshattriya? Neither of these\ncircumstances is stated in the legend in the Sa _m_ varga-vidya! To this\nquestion the Sutra replies, 'on account of the inferential mark.' From the\ninferential mark that _S_ aunaka Kapeya and Abhipratarin Kakshaseni are said\nto have been sitting together at a meal we understand that there is some\nconnexion between Abhipratarin and the Kapeyas. Now another scriptural passage\nruns as follows: 'The Kapeyas made _K_ aitraratha perform that sacrifice' (Ta\n_nd_ Bra. XX, 12, 5), and this shows that one connected with the Kapeyas was a\n_K_ aitraratha; and a further text shows that a _K_ aitraratha is a\nKshattriya. 'from him there was descended a _K_ aitraratha who was a prince.'\nAll this favours the inference that Abhipratarin was a _K_ aitraratha and a\nKshattriya.\n\nSo far the Sutras have shown that there is no inferential mark to prove what\nis contradicted by reasoning, viz. the qualification of the _S_ udras. The\nnext Sutra declares that the non-qualification of the _S_ udra proved by\nreasoning is confirmed by Scripture and Sm _ri_ ti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 36.
