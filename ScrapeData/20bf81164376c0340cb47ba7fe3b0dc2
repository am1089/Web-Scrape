INDEX OF WORDS.\n\nII. LIST OF THE MORE IMPORTANT PASSAGES QUOTED IN THE PREFACE AND IN THE\nNOTES.\n\nIII. A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL LIST OF THE MORE IMPORTANT PUBLICATIONS ON THE RIG-\nVEDA.\n\np. 453 p. 454\n\nNote that the original lexicographic ordering of this index, preserved in this\ntranscription, is based on the Sanskrit alphabet. Also see the transcription\nnotes, below.-- _JBH_\n\nThe following Index of Words was commenced by Professor Thibaut, and continued\nand finished by Dr. Winternitz. I beg to express my gratitude to both of them,\nmore particularly to Dr. Winternitz, who has spared no pains in order to make\nthe Index as complete and as accurate as possible.--F. M. M.\n\nThe Index contains all the words of the hymns translated in this volume, and\nbesides, all the words about which something is said in the Notes.\n\nThe lists of passages are complete, except when three dots (\xe2\x80\xa6) are put after\nthe word (e. g. a _k_ _kh_ a \xe2\x80\xa6).\n\nThree figures refer to Ma _n_ _d_ ala, hymn, and verse, a small figure to a\nnote, e. g. X, 77, 2:1, stands for Ma _n_ _d_ ala X, hymn 77, verse 2, note 1\n(the word occurs in X, 77, 2, and also in note 1).\n\nIf a word occurs in a note only, the passage is put in parentheses, e. g. (V,\n61, 41) means that the word occurs in note 1 on V, 61, 4, but _not_ in V, 61,\n4.\n\nIn the case of longer notes, it seemed advisable to refer to the page. _One_\nnumber refers to the page, e. g. (287) means that the word occurs in a note on\npage 287.\n\n#### NOTES ON THE TRANSCRIPTION OF THIS INDEX.\n\nThe format of this transcription of the index varies slightly from the printed\nversion so that this section can be parsed automatically if needed.\n\nIn the printed edition, the main entry appeared on a line by itself, followed\nby a colon, with successive forms on the next line indented one level. Sub-\nentries appeared on separate lines, with more indentation. The entries have\nbeen, essentially, flattened in this transcription: in other words, there is a\none-to-one correspondence between entries and lines.\n\nOnly explicit page number references have been hyperlinked.\n\nIn the printed version, footnotes are indicated by superscripts. In this\ntranscription, footnotes are prefixed by a colon following the verse number.\nFor instance, X, 77, 2:1 originally appeared as X, 77, 21. In the case where\nmultiple superscripts appeared, a colon followed by the footnotes in square\nbrackets: X, 77, 2:[1, 2] was originally X, 77, 21, 2. However, footnotes with\nlowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.) are transcribed with a superscript, e. g.\nNote a, as in the original. This only applies to the Index of Words section:\neverywhere else in the transcription of this book, superscripts are used to\nindicate footnotes as in the original.-- _JBH_\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: A](sbe3265.htm)\n\n'
