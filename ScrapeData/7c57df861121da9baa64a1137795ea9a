Now the Seasons were desirous to have a share in the sacrifice\namong the gods, and said, 'Let us share in the sacrifice! Do not exclude us\nfrom the sacrifice! Let us have a share in the sacrifice!'\n\n1:6:1:22\\. The gods, however, did not approve of this. The gods not approving,\nthe Seasons went to the Asuras, the malignant, spiteful enemies of the gods.\n\n1:6:1:33\\. Those (Asuras) then throve in such a manner that they (the gods)\nheard of it; for even while the foremost (of the Asuras) were still ploughing\nand sowing, those behind them were already engaged in reaping and threshing:\nindeed even without tilling the plants ripened forthwith for them.\n\n1:6:1:44\\. This now caused anxiety to the gods: 'That owing to that (desertion\nof the Seasons), enemy\n\np. 156\n\n[paragraph continues] (viz. the Asuras) seeks to injure enemy (viz. us) is of\nlittle consequence; but this indeed goes too far: try to find out how\nhenceforth this may be different 1!'\n\n1:6:1:55\\. They then said, 'Let us invite the Seasons!'--'How? Let us offer\nprayer to them first of all at the sacrifice!'\n\n1:6:1:66\\. Agni then said, 'But whereas hitherto you used to offer prayer to\nme in the first place, what is now to become of me?' 'We will not remove you\nfrom your place!' said they. And since, in inviting the Seasons, they did not\nremove Agni from his place, for that reason Agni is immutable 2; and verily,\nhe who knows that Agni to be immutable, does not move from the place where he\nbides.\n\n1:6:1:77\\. The gods said to Agni, 'Go and invite them hither!' Agni went to\nthem and said, 'O Seasons, I have obtained for you a share in the sacrifice\namong the gods.' They said, 'In what form hast thou obtained it for us?' He\nreplied, 'They will offer prayer to you first at the sacrifice.'\n\n1:6:1:88\\. The Seasons said to Agni, 'We will let thee share along with us in\nthe sacrifice who hast obtained for us a share in the sacrifice among the\ngods!' And because Agni has been allowed a share along with the Seasons (the\noffering-prayers are): 'The Samidhs, O Agni, (may accept the butter) 3 . . .\n!'\n\np. 157\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Tanunapat, O Agni . . .!' 'The I _d_ s, O Agni . . .!'\n'The Barhis, O Agni. . .!' 'Svaha Agni!' And verily, whosoever knows that Agni\nis thus allowed to share (in the sacrifice) along with the Seasons, he is\nallowed to participate in whatever auspicious rite is performed by one who\nprofesses to be equal (in that knowledge) to him;--for him, being possessed of\nAgni, the Seasons, themselves possessed of Agni, ripen the plants and\neverything here.\n\n1:6:1:99\\. Now, as to this point, some raise the objection, 'But since they\ninvite the fore-offerings last of all (at the two libations of butter) 1, why\ndo they offer prayer to them first of all?'--Because they established them\nlast of all in the sacrifice 2; and because they said, 'we will offer prayer\nto you first:' for that reason they invite them last, and offer prayer to them\nfirst.\n\n1:6:1:1010\\. By the fourth fore-offering the gods, assuredly, obtained the\nsacrifice, and by the fifth they firmly established it; and by what part of\nthe sacrifice after that remained unaccomplished they gained the world of\nheaven.\n\n1:6:1:1111\\. In going to heaven they were afraid of an attack from the Asuras\nand Rakshas. They placed Agni at their head, as the Rakshas-killer, the\nrepeller of the Rakshas; they placed Agni in their midst, as the Rakshas-\nkiller, the repeller of the Rakshas; they placed Agni in their rear, as the\nRakshas-killer, the repeller of the Rakshas.\n\np. 158\n\n1:6:1:1212\\. And if the Asuras and Rakshas wished to attack them in front,\nAgni repelled them, as the Rakshas-killer, the repeller of the Rakshas; if\nthey wished to attack in the centre, Agni repelled them, as the Rakshas-\nkiller, the repeller of the Rakshas; and if they wished to attack in the rear,\nAgni repelled them, as the Rakshas-killer, the repeller of the Rakshas: being\nthus guarded on all sides by Agnis, they reached the world of heaven.\n\n1:6:1:1313\\. And in the same way this one now obtains the sacrifice by means\nof the fourth fore-offering, and by means of the fifth he establishes it; and\nby what part of the sacrifice after that remains un-accomplished, he gains the\nworld of heaven.\n\n1:6:1:1414\\. Now when he pronounces the offering-prayer over Agni's butter-\nportion, he thereby places Agni in front, as the Rakshas-killer, the repeller\nof the Rakshas; and when Agni's sacrificial cake is (offered), he thereby\nplaces Agni in the midst, as the Rakshas-killer, the repeller of the Rakshas;\nand when he pronounces the offering-prayer to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (the\nmaker of good offering), he thereby places Agni in the rear, as the Rakshas-\nkiller, the repeller of the Rakshas.\n\n1:6:1:1515\\. And if the Asuras and Rakshas try to attack him (the sacrificer)\nin front, Agni repels them, as the Rakshas-killer, the Repeller of the\nRakshas: if they try to attack him in the centre, Agni repels them, as the\nRakshas-killer, the repeller of the Rakshas; and if they try to attack him\nfrom behind, Agni repels them, as the Rakshas-killer, the repeller of the\nRakshas: being thus guarded on every side by Agnis, he gains the world of\nheaven.\n\n1:6:1:1616\\. And if any one were to imprecate evil on him\n\np. 159\n\npreviously to (or, in the fore-part of) the (chief) sacrifice, let him be thus\nspoken to, 'Thou shalt suffer some disease of the face! thou shalt become\neither blind or deaf!' for these, in truth, are diseases of the face: and thus\nit would indeed fare with him.\n\n1:6:1:1717\\. If any one were to imprecate evil on him in the middle of the\nsacrifice, let him be thus spoken to, 'Thou shalt be without offspring,\nwithout cattle!' for offspring and cattle, indeed, constitute the centre (i.e.\nthe substantial possession of man): and thus it would indeed fare with him.\n\n1:6:1:1818\\. If any one were to imprecate evil on him after the completion of\nthe (chief) sacrifice, let him be thus spoken to, 'Unstable and poor, thou\nshalt swiftly go to yonder world!' for thus it would indeed fare with him. One\nshould not therefore utter imprecations: for whosoever thus understands this\nhas the advantage.\n\n1:6:1:1919\\. He who gains by means of the fore-offerings, assuredly, gains the\nyear 1. But he alone gains it who knows its doors; for what were he to do with\na house who cannot find his way inside? Even as those (fore-offerings) are\n(the doors) of this (sacrifice), so is the spring a door, and so is the winter\na door, of that (year). This same year he enters, as the world of heaven; for,\nassuredly, the year is all, and the All (universe) is imperishable: his\nthereby becomes imperishable merit, the imperishable world.\n\n#### THE TWO BUTTER-PORTIONS (\xc3\x82 _G_ YABH\xc3\x82GA) TO AGNI AND SOMA.\n\n1:6:1:2020\\. Here now some say, 'To what deity belong the butter-portions?'\nLet him reply, 'To Pra _g_ apati;'\n\np. 160\n\nfor, assuredly, Pra _g_ apati is undefined [1](sbe1227.htm#fn_373)\n(mysterious); and undefined are the butter-portions, because they have the\nsacrificer for their deity; for the sacrificer is Pra _g_ apati at his own\nsacrifice, since it is by his order that the priests spread and produce it.\n\n1:6:1:2121\\. Having basted the havis with butter and made two cuttings from\nit, he pours some of the butter thereon: thus the oblation is offered combined\nwith butter, and thereby indeed it is offered combined with the sacrificer;\nand for one who knows this,--whether he has a sacrifice performed for him\nwhile he is far away, or while he is near,--the sacrifice is performed in the\nsame way as it would be performed if he were near; and he who knows this, even\nthough he do much evil, is not shut out from the sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[156:1](sbe1226.htm#fr_370) 'Kaniya in nv ato dvishan dvishate 'ratiyati kim v\netavanmatram upa _g_ anita yathedam ito 'nyathasad iti.'
