Where the cognising person is one only,\nrepetition of the same matter under a new heading can only be explained as\nmeaning difference of object enjoined, and hence separation of the two vidyas.\nBut where the cognising persons are different (and this of course is eminently\nso in the case of different _s_ akhas), the double statement of one and the\nsame matter explains itself as subserving the cognition of those different\npersons, and hence does not imply difference of matter enjoined.--The next\nSutra\n\np. 631\n\nrefutes the argument founded on a rite enjoined in the Mu _nd_ aka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3.
