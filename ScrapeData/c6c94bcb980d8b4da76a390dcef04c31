He had collected a quantity of\nrice by begging, and after having dined off it, he filled a pot with what was\nleft over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall, placed his couch beneath, and\nlooking intently at it all the night, he thought, "Ah, that pot is indeed\nbrimful of rice. Now, if there should be a famine, I should certainly make a\nhundred rupees by it. With this I shall buy a couple of goats. They will have\nyoung ones every six months, and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats.\nThen, with the goats, I shall buy cows. As soon as they have calved, I shall\nsell the calves. Then, with the calves, I shall buy buffaloes; with the\nbuffaloes, mares. When the mares have foaled, I shall have plenty of horses;\nand when I sell them, plenty of gold. With that gold I shall get a house with\nfour wings. And then a Brahman will come to my house, and will give me his\nbeautiful daughter, with a large dowry. She will have a son, and I shall call\nhim Somasarman. When he is old enough to be danced on his father\'s knee, I\nshall sit with a book at the back of the stable, and while I am reading, the\nboy will see me, jump from his mother\'s lap, and run towards me to be danced\non my knee. He will come too near the horse\'s hoof, and, full of anger, I\nshall call to my wife, \'Take the baby; take him!\' But she, distracted by some\ndomestic work, does not hear me. Then I get up, and give her such a kick with\nmy foot." While he thought this, he gave a kick with his foot, and broke the\npot. All the rice fell over him, and made him quite white. Therefore, I say,\n"He who makes foolish plans for the future will be white all over, like the\nfather of Somasarman."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Magic Fiddle](ift07.htm)\n\n'
