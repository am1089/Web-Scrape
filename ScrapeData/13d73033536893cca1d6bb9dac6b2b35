Thus, from the denial of anything else.\n\nNor can we allow the assertion that there is something higher than the highest\nbecause certain texts (\'the Person which is higher than the highest\'; \'beyond\nthe Imperishable there is the highest,\' &c.) refer to such a difference.\n\np. 624\n\n[paragraph continues] For the same texts expressly deny that there is anything\nelse higher than the highest--\'than whom there is nothing else higher, than\nwhom there is nothing smaller or larger\' ( _S_ vet. Up. III, 9). So also other\ntexts: \'For there is nothing else higher than this "not so"\' (i.e. than this\nBrahman designated by the phrase \'not so\'; B _ri_. Up. II, 3, 6); \'Of him none\nis the Lord, his name is great glory\' (Mahanar. Up. I, 10).\n\nBut what then is the entity referred to in the text \'tato yad uttarataram \'? (\n_S_ vet. Up. III, 10)?--The passage immediately preceding (8), \'I know that\ngreat person, &c.; a man who knows him passes over death,\' had declared that\nthe knowledge of Brahman is the only way to immortality; and the clause (9),\n\'Higher than whom there is nothing else,\' had confirmed this by declaring that\nBrahman is the Highest and that there is no other thing higher. In agreement\nherewith we must explain stanza 10 as giving a reason for what had been said,\n\'Because that which is the highest (uttarataram), viz. the Supreme Person is\nwithout form and without suffering, therefore (tata _h_ ) those who know him\nbecome immortal,\' &c. On any other explanation stanza 10 would not be in\nharmony with stanza 8 where the subject is introduced, and with what is\ndeclared in stanza 9.--Analogously in the text \'He goes to the divine Person\nwho is higher than the highest\' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8) \'the highest\' means the\naggregate soul (samasha-purusha), which in a previous passage had been said to\nbe \'higher than the high Imperishable\' (II, 1, 2); and the \'higher\' refers to\nthe Supreme Person, with all his transcendent qualities, who is superior to\nthe aggregate soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 36.
