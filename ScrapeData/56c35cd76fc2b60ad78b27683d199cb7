Victor named;  \nAnd let a thousand coins of gold,  \nGreat Brahman, with the gift be told.'  \nThus Rama spoke: nor he declined  \nThe noble gitts for him designed.  \nOn Rama, Lakshman, Sita he  \nInvoked all high felicity.  \n\nIn pleasant words then Rama gave  \nHis hest to Lakshman prompt and brave,  \nAs Brahma speaks for Him to hear  \nWho rules the Gods' celestial sphere:  \n'To the two best of Brahmans run;  \nAgastya bring, and Kus'ik's son,  \nAnd precious gifts upon them rain,  \nLike fostering floods upon the grain.  \nO long-armed Prince of Raghu's line,  \nDelight them with a thousand kine,  \nAnd many a fair and costly gem,  \nWith gold and silver, give to them.  \nTo him, so deep in Scripture, who,  \nTo Queen Kaus'alya, ever true,  \nServes her with blessing and respect,  \nChief of the Taittiriya sect  1b\\--  \nTo him. with women-slaves, present  \nA chariot rich with ornament,  \nAnd costly robes of silk beside,  \nUntil the sage be satisfied.  \nOn Chitraratha. true aud dear,  \nMy tuneful bard and charioteer,  \nGems, robes, and plenteous wealth confer--  \nMine ancient friend and minister.  \nAnd these who go with staff in hand,  \nGrammarians trained, a numerous band.  \nWho their deep study only prize,  \nNor think of other exercise,  \nWho toil not, loving dainty fare,  \nWhose praises e'en the good declare--  \nOn these be eighty cars bestowed,  \nAnd each with precious treasures load.  \n\np. 133  \n\nA thousand bulls for them suffice,  \nTwo hundred elephants of price,  \nAnd let a thousand kine beside  \nThe dainties of each meal provide.  \nThe throng who sacred girdles wear,  \nAnd on Kausalya wait with care--  \nA thousand golden coins shall please,  \nSon of Sumitra, each of these.  \nLet all, dear Lakshman, of the train  \nThese special gifts of honour gain;  \nMy mother will rejoice to know  \nHer Brahmans have been cherished so.'  \n\nThen Raghu's son addressed the crowd  \nWho round him stood and wept aloud,  \nWhen he to all who thronged the court  \nHad dealt his wealth for their support:  \n'In Lakshman's house and mine remain,  \nAnd guard them till I come again,'  \nTo all his people sad with grief.  \nIn loving ords thus spoke their chief,  \nThen bade his treasure-keeper bring  \nGold, silver, and each precious thing.  \nThen straight the servants went and bore  \nBack to their chief the wealth in store,  \nBefore the people's eyes it shone,  \nA glorious pile to look upon.  \nThe prince of men with Lakshman's aid  \nParted the treasuures there displaved,  \nGave to the poor, the young, the old,  \nAnd twice-born men, the gems and gold.  \n   A Brahman, long in evil case.  \nNamed Trijat, born of Garga's race,  \nEarned ever toiling in a wood  \nWith spade and plough his livelihood.  \nThe youthful wife, his babes who bore,  \nTheir indigence felt more and more.  \nThus to the aged man she spake:  \n'Hear this my word: my counsel take.  \nCome, throw thy spade and plough away;  \nTo virtuous Rama go to-day.  \nAnd somewhat of his kindness pray.'  \n   He heard the word she spoke: around  \nHis limbs his ragged cloth he wound.  \nAnd took his journey by the road  \nThat led to Rama's fair abode.  \nTo the fifth court be made his way;  \nNor met the Brahman check or stay.  \nBrighu, Angiras 1 could not be  \nBrighter with saintly light than Vie,  \nTo Rama's presence on he pressed.  \nAnd thus the noble chief addressed:  \n'O Rama, poor and weak am I,  \nAnd many children round me cry.  \nScant living in the woods I earn:  \nOn me thine eye of pity turn.'  \nAnd Rama, bent on sport and jest,  \nThe suppliant Brahman thus addressed:  \n\n'O aged man, one thousand kine,  \nYet undistributed, are mine.  \nThe cows on thee will I bestow  \nAs far as thou thy staff canst throw.  \n   The Brahman heard. In eager haste  \nHe bound his cloth around his waist.  \nThen round his head his staff he whirled,  \nAnd forth with mightiest effort hurled.  \nCast from his hand it flew, and sank  \nTo earth on Sarju's farther bank,  \nWhere herds of kine in thousands fed  \nNear to the well-stocked bullock shed.  \nAnd all the cows that wandered o'er  \nThe meadow, far as Sarju's shore.  \nAt Rama's word the herdsmen drove  \nTo Trijat's cottage in the grove.  \nHe drew the Brahman to his breast,  \nAnd thus with calming words addressed:  \n'Now be not angry, Sire. I pray:  \nThis jest of mine was meant in play.  \nThese thousand kine, but not alone.  \nTheir herdsmen too, are all thine own.  \nAnd wealth beside I give thee: speak.  \nThine shall be all thy heart can seek.'  \n   Thus Rama spake. And Trijat prayed  \nFor means his sacrifice to aid.  \nAnd Rama gave much wealth, required  \nTo speed his offering as desired.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[132:1](ry110.htm#fr_307) The chapel where the sacred fire used in worship is\nkept.\n\n[132:1b](ry110.htm#fr_308) The students and teachers of the Taittiriya portion\nof the Yajur Veda.\n\n[133:1](ry110.htm#fr_309) Two of the divine persaonnges called _prej apatis_\nand _*Brahmadikas*_ who were first created by Brahma.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXIII.: The People's Lament.](ry111.htm)\n\n"
