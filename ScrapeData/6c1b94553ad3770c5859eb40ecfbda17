For Asia is one, and the wondrous Maiden of all Christian art, from the\nByzantines down to yesterday--who is she, of what is she aware, save that she\nis a simple Eastern mother? Of what fasts and vigils are we told in her case,\nthat she should have known herself, or been known, as Queen of Saints? A rapt\nhumility, as of one whose robe was always, indeed, her veil; a touch of deep\nsilence, and that gracious richness of maternity which we can infer from the\nfull and rounded sweetness of the Child who grew within her shadow--what more\ndo we know of the Blessed Virgin than these things?\n\nWhat more we may desire to know we can learn in the East itself--in India as\nwell as anywhere. For in the period before Islam had defined itself,\noverflowing Chaldea, with the impulse, perhaps, of the pastoral life, become\naggressive, to re-make the desert--in the days when Palestine and Lebanon were\ncultivated lands, inhabited by peasants of the early type, not as yet made a\nburnt-offering on the altar of crusading fury, in the closing centuries of the\npre-Christian era--the common life of Syria had a still wider identity with\nthat of Hindus than it has to-day. The ceremonial washings of Pharisees and\nSadducees, the constant purifying of the cup and\n\np. 18\n\nplatter, the habitual repetition of a single name or prayer, which some later\nphase of the Christianising consciousness has stigmatised as "vain"--these\nthings were not _like_ , they _were_ , what we know today as Hinduism, being\nmerely those threads of the one great web of Asiatic life that happened to\ntouch the Mediterranean coast.\n\nAnd in matters so fundamental as the relation of mother and child, religious\nteachers come only to enforce the message of the race. Is it not said by the\nProphet himself that the man who kisses the feet of his mother finds himself\nin Paradise?\n\nYet how frail and slight and young is often the mother so tenderly adored! No\nMadonna of the Sistine Chapel can give that lofty purity of brow or delicate\nuntouched virginity of look of any one of these Hindu mother-maidens, whose\nveil half covers, half reveals, as he rests on her left arm, her son!\n\nThe picture is too central to Indian life to have demanded literary\nidealising. Poetic and mythological presentments of the perfect wife there are\nin plenty: of motherhood, none. Only God is worshipped as such by men and\nchildren and by mothers themselves as the Holy Child! Here the half pathos of\nWestern maternity, with its perpetual suggestion of the brood-hen whose\nfledglings are about to escape her, is gone, and an overwhelming sense of\ntenderness and union takes its place. To one\'s mother one always remains a\nbaby. It would be unmanly to disguise the fact. And yet for her sake most of\nall it is needful to play the man, that she may have a support on which to\nlean in the hour of darkness and need. Even a wife has no power to bring\ndivision between a mother and her son, for the wife belongs almost more to her\nhusband\'s mother than to himself. There can, therefore, be no jealousy at the\nentry of another woman into his life. Instead of this, it is she who urges the\nmarriage; every\n\np. 19\n\noffering is sent out in her name; and the procession that wends from the\nbridegroom\'s house to the bride\'s some few days before the wedding, bearing\nunguents and fragrant oils for the ceremonial bath, carries her loving\ninvitation and goodwill to the new and longed-for daughter.\n\nEven in Indian home life, then, full as this is of intensity of sweetness,\nthere is no other tie to be compared in depth to that which binds together the\nmother and her child. With the coming of her firstborn, be it boy or girl, the\nyoung wife has been advanced, as it were, out of the novitiate. She has become\na member of the authoritative circle. It is as if the whole world recognises\nthat henceforth there will be one soul at least to whom her every act is holy,\nbefore whom she is entirely without fault, and enters into the conspiracy of\nmaintaining her child\'s reverence.\n\nFor there are no circumstances sufficient in Eastern eyes to justify criticism\nof a mother by her child. Their horror of the fault of Gertrude is almost\nexaggerated, yet Hamlet\'s spell is invariably broken when he speaks of the\nfact. To him, her sin should be sacred, beyond reproach; he ought not to be\nable to think of it as other than his own.\n\nThe freedom and pleasantries of filial sentiment in the West are thus largely\nwanting in that of the East. A determined stampede of babies of from three to\nsix may, indeed, take place day after day through the room where their mother\nis at prayer. There may even be an attempt at such an hour to take the city by\nassault, the children leaping vociferously on the back of that good mother,\nwhose quiet of conscience depends, as they well know, on her perfect silence,\nso that she can punish them only by turning towards them the sweetest of\nsmiles. "Why, mother," said her family priest to one who appealed to him\nregarding devotions interrupted\n\np. 20\n\nthus, "the Lord knows that you are a mother, and He makes allowance for these\nthings!" But though, in the Oriental home, the wickedness of rive years old\nmay find such vent as this, the off-hand camaraderie that learns later to dub\nits parents "mater" and "governor" suggests a state little short of savagery,\nand the daughter who permits herself to precede her father is held guilty of\nsacrilege. The tenderness of parents corresponds to this veneration of\nchildren, and we only learn the secret of feelings so deep-rooted when we find\nthat every child is a nurseling for its first two years of life. Consciousness\nand even thought are thus awakened long before the closest intimacy is broken,\nand a dependence that to us of the West is but a vague imagination, to the\nEastern man or woman is a living memory.\n\nHow completely this may become an ingrained motive we see in the case of that\nMogul Emperor who is remembered simply as "the Great." For Akbar had a foster-\nbrother in the Rajput household whither his father Humayum had fled before his\nbirth and where his first six years of life were passed. Akbar\'s mother dying,\nthe Rajput Queen took the babe to nurse with her own son, and brought up the\nboys in this respect as brothers, though the guest was a Mussulman of\nTamerlane\'s descent, and her own the proudest Hindu blood on earth. Events\nswept the children apart in boyhood, and, destiny fulfilling itself, he who\ncame of a race of conquerors ascended the throne of Delhi, after many years,\nas Emperor of India. Then he found his Rajput subjects difficult indeed to\nsubjugate. In them, the national idea renewed itself again and again, and\ninsurrection followed insurrection. There was one name, moreover, in every\nlist of rebels, and men wondered at the indulgence with which the august ruler\npassed it by so often. At last some\n\np. 21\n\none ventured to point it out, protesting that justice must surely be done now.\n"Justice, my friend!" said the lofty Akbar, turning on his counsellor, "there\nis an ocean of milk between him and me and that justice cannot cross!"\n\nThis long babyhood creates a tie that nothing can break. The thoughts and\nfeelings of womanhood never become ridiculous in the eyes of the Indian man.\nIt is no shame to him that his mother could not bear a separation; it is right\nand natural that he should be guided by this wish of hers. None but the\nhopelessly degraded ever reacts against woman\'s weakness in active cruelty. If\none asks some hard worker in his old age to what he owes his habit of industry\nor his determined perseverance over detail, it is more than likely that his\nreply will take us back to his infancy, and the wishes that a young mother,\nlong dead, may have expressed for him. Or the man, in perplexity as to the\ncourse he should pursue, will go as naturally as a child, to test his question\nin the light of her feminine intuition. In all probability, she is utterly\nunlearned, but he knows well the directness of her mind, and judges rightly\nthat wisdom lies in love and experience, having but little to do with letters.\n\nSurely one of the sweetest happenings was that of a little boy of six who\nbecame in later life extremely distinguished. His mother, too shy to express\nthe wish for instruction to her learned husband, confided in her son, and day\nafter day he would toddle home from the village school, slate and pencil in\nhand, to go once more through his morning\'s lesson with her, and so, with\nmutual secrecy, she was taught to read by her own child! With almost all great\nmen in India the love of their mothers has been a passion. It is told of a\nfamous Bengali judge who died some twenty-five years ago--one whose judicial\ndecisions were recorded and\n\np. 22\n\nquoted, even by the Englishmen who heard them, as precedents in English law,\nit is told of this man, when on his deathbed, that his mother stumbled and\nhurt her foot on the threshold of his room one morning, as she came after\nbathing to visit him. Another moment, and, weak as he was, he had crept across\nthe floor, and lay before her, kissing the wounded foot again and again, and\nbathing it in hot tears of self-reproach for the pain it suffered. Such\nstories are remembered and repeated in Indian society, not because they\noccasion. surprise, but because they make the man\'s own name holy. The death\nscene with Aase would redeem Peer Gynt himself. None who is sound in this\nbasic relationship of life can be altogether corrupt in the rest, nor can his\ndecisions, however adverse, be completely repugnant to us. How curious are the\ndisputes that agitate Christendom as to the sentiment one may fittingly\nindulge towards the mother of a beloved Son! Is her supreme position in His\nlife not self-evident? What, then, could be more convincing of union with Him\nthan sweetness of feeling and words of endearment addressed to her? And so,\nwith its wonderful simplicity, the great heart of the East sweeps aside our\nflimsy arguments and holds up to us the fact itself.\n\nBut it is not the great alone who worship motherhood in India. Never can I\nforget the long hours of one hot March day, when I sat by the bedside of a boy\nwho was dying of plague. His home was of the humblest, a mud hut with a\nthatched roof. His family were Sudras, or working-folk. Even his father, it\nappeared, could not read or write. The boy was eleven or twelve years of age,\nan only child, and he was doomed. The visitor\'s sole real usefulness lay in\ntaking precautions against the spread of the disease.\n\nAmongst the veiled and silent women who came\n\np. 23\n\nand went at the other side of the little court where the boy lay, was one who\nslipped noiselessly to his bedside whenever she could, and exposed herself to\nthe infection with a recklessness born of ignorance. At last I attempted to\nreason with her, urging her, as gently as I could, to remain at some distance\nfrom the lad, and thus avoid the danger for herself and others.\n\nShe turned to obey without a word, but as she went the tears poured down her\npoor thin cheeks, and lifting the corner of her sari to wipe them away, she\ntried to stifle the sobs she could not altogether repress. At that moment the\nwords reached me from the doorway. "She is his mother." What I did can be\nimagined. Suddenly I discovered that the boy must be fanned, and that there\nwas a place behind his pillow out of the line of the air current. Here, with\nhis head almost resting on her feet, his mother sat henceforth, crouched up,\nattending to her child through happy hours.\n\nOften he would grow delirious, and forget her presence. Then he would toss his\nhead from side to side, and his fever-lighted eyes stared blankly at me, while\nhe uttered his one cry, "Ma! Ma! Mataji!--Mother! Mother? _honoured_ Mother!"\nTo my Western ears it seemed a strange cry for a child of the slums!\nSometimes, as memory returned, he would smile at me, mistaking me for her, and\nonce he snatched at my hand and then carried his own to his lips. Sweet,\nunknown mother, forgive me these thefts of love, that rent the veil from a\ngraciousness so perfect, an adoration so deep!\n\nThat day, alas, was their last together. All through the hours, the child had\nstruggled to repeat the name of God. Late in the afternoon he stumbled on a\nhymn that was much sung at the time about the streets; but he could not say\nit, and it was my part to take up the words and stand repeating them\n\np. 24\n\nbeside him. A smile of relief passed over his face; he lay quiet for a moment.\nThen his breath came shorter and shorter, and as the sun set, with his\nmother\'s eyes upon his face, he died.\n\nOf such stuff as this are the teeming millions of the Hindu people made. In\nmoments of mortal agony, when Western lips would frame a prayer, perhaps half\nan oath, the groan that they utter is ever the cry of the child in its deepest\nneed, "Oh, Mother!"\n\nBut it is easy to multiply instances. What we want is that epic of motherhood,\nof which each separate mother and her child are but a single line or stanza,\nthat all-compelling imagination of the race, which must for ever be working\nitself out through the individual.\n\nWe talk glibly of Dante\'s "Vision of Hell." How many of us have looked into\nhell, or even seen it from afar off, that we should appreciate what it means\nto descend there? When the gloom of insanity falls upon the soul so that it\nturns to rend and destroy its dearest and best, when the blight of some dread\nimagination covers us with its shadow, is it lover, or child, or servant, who\nwill still find in our maimed and maleficent presence his chiefest good? There\nis One indeed whom we cannot imagine as forsaking us. One whose will for us\nhas been the law of righteousness, and yet for whose help we shall cry out\ninstinctively in the moment of the commission of a crime. And like the love of\nGod in this respect is, to Hindu thinking, that of a mother. Transcending the\nwife\'s, which may fluctuate with the sweetness bestowed upon it, the mother\'s\naffection, by its very nature, grows deeper with deep need, and follows the\nbeloved even into hell. A yearning love that can never refuse us; a\nbenediction that for ever abides with us; a presence from which we cannot grow\naway; a heart in which\n\np. 25\n\nwe are always safe; sweetness unfathomed, bond unbreakable, holiness without a\nshadow--all these indeed, and more, is motherhood. Small wonder that the\ninnermost longing of every Hindu is to find himself at home in the Universe,\nwith all that comes thereby of joy or sorrow, even as a baby lying against its\nmother\'s heart! This is the dream that is called Nirvana, Freedom. It is the\nceasing from those preferences that withhold us that is called Renunciation.\n\nThe very word "mother" is held to be sacred, and good men offer it to good\nwomen for their protection. There is no timely service that may not be\nrendered to one, however young or beautiful, by the passing stranger, if only\nhe first address her thus. Even a father, looking at some small daughter, and\nstruggling to express the mystery of futurity that he beholds in her, may\naddress her as "little mother." And the mother of the nation, Uma Himavutee,\nis portrayed always as a child, thought of always as a daughter of the house.\nIn motherhood alone does marriage become holy; without it, the mere indulgence\nof affection has no right to be. This is the true secret of the longing for\nchildren. And to reach that height of worship in which the husband feels his\nwife to be his mother, is at once to crown and end all lower ties.\n\nWho that has ever watched it can forget a Hindu woman\'s worship of the Holy\nChild? A small brass image of the Baby Krishna lies, or kneels at play, in a\ntiny cot, and through the hours of morning, after her bath and before her\ncooking, the woman, who may or may not herself be wife and mother, sits\noffering to this image flowers and the water of the bath, fruits, sweets, and\nother things--her oblations interspersed with constant acts of meditation and\nsilent prayer. She is striving to\n\np. 26\n\nworship God as the Child Saviour, struggling to think of herself as the Mother\nof God. She is ready enough to give her reason, if we ask her. "Does my\nfeeling for my children change according to what they do for me?" she\nquestions in return: "Even so should one love God. Mothers love most those who\nneed most. Even so should one love God." The simple answer is worth a world of\ntheology. Nor is it forgotten presently that the other children, made of flesh\nand blood, and answering to her call, are likewise His images. In every moment\nof feeding, or training, or play, of serving or using or enjoying, she may\nmake her dealing with these an act of devotion. It was her object, during the\nhours of worship, to come face to face with the Universal Self. Has she done\nthis, or has she brooded over the ideal sentiment till she has made of herself\nthe perfect mother?\n\nBy her child, again, her intention can never be doubted. She may turn on him\nnow a smile and then a face of sorrow, now a word of praise and again an\nindignant reproach. But always, equally, she remains the mother. The heart of\nhearts of her deed is unfailing love. She knows well, too, that nothing her\nbabies do can mean anything else. The sunny and the petulant, the obedient and\nthe wilful, are only seeking so many different ways to express a self-same\ndependence. To each she accords the welcome of his own nature. In such a\nreconciliation of opposites, in such a discovery of unity in variety, lies the\nwhole effort and trend of Eastern religion.\n\nFor what thought is it that speaks supremely to India in the great word\n"Mother"? Is it not the vision of a love that never seeks to possess, that is,\ncontent simply to _be_ \\--a giving that could not wish return: a radiance that\nwe do not even dream of grasping, but in which we are content to bask,\n\np. 27\n\nletting the eternal sunshine play around and through us?\n\nAnd yet, and yet, was there ever an ideal of such strength as this, that was\nnot firm-based on some form of discipline? What, then, is the price that is\npaid by Hindu women for a worship so precious? The price is the absolute\ninviolability of marriage. The worship is, at bottom, the worship of\nsteadfastness and purity. If it were conceivable to the Hindu son that his\nmother could cease for one moment to be faithful to his father--whatever the\nprovocation, the coldness, or even cruelty, to which she might be subjected--\nat that moment his idealism of her would become a living pain. A widow\nremarried is no better in Hindu eyes than a woman of no character, and this is\nthe case even where the marriage was only betrothal, and the young _fianc ee_\nhas become what we know as a child-widow.\n\nThis inviolability of the marriage tie has nothing whatever to do with\nattraction and mutual love. Once a wife, always a wife, even though the bond\nbe shared with others, or remain always only a name. That other men should be\nonly as shadows to her, that her feet should be ready at all times to go forth\non any path, even that of death, as the companion of her husband, these things\nconstitute the purity of the wife in India. It is told of some wives with\nbated breath, how, on hearing of the approaching death of the beloved, they\nhave turned, smiling, and gone to sleep, saying, "I must precede, not follow!"\nand from that sleep they never woke again.\n\nBut if we probe deep enough, what, after all, is purity? Where and when can we\nsay it is, and how are we to determine that here and now it is not? What is\nthere sacred in one man\'s monopoly? or if it be of the mind alone, how can any\nphysical test be rightly imposed?\n\np. 28\n\nPurity in every one of its forms is the central pursuit of Indian life. But\neven the passion of this search grows pale beside the remorseless truthfulness\nof Hindu logic. There is ultimately, admits India, no single thing called\npurity: there is the great life of the impersonal, surging through the\nindividual, and each virtue in its turn is but another name for this.\n\nAnd so the idea of the sanctity of motherhood, based on the inviolability of\nmarriage, finds due and logical completion in the still greater doctrine of\nthe sacredness of religious celibacy. It is the towering ideal of the\nsupersocial life--"As Mount Meru to a fire-fly" compared to that of the\nhouseholder--which gives sanction and relation to all social bonds. In\nproportion as the fact of manhood becomes priesthood, does it attain its full\nglory; and the mother, entering into the prison of a sweet dedication, that\nshe may bestow upon her own child the mystery of breath, makes possible in his\neyes, by the perfect stainlessness of her devotion, the thought of that other\nlife whose head touches the stars.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III.
