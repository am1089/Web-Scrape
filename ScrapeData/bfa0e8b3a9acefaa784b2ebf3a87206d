He was Rajah of\nall the country round; and every day he used to leave his den, in the deepest\nshadow of the rocks, and roar with a loud, angry voice; and when he roared,\nthe other animals in the jungle, who were all his subjects, got very much\nfrightened, and ran here and there; and Singh Rajab would pounce upon them,\nand kill them, and gobble them up for his dinner.\n\nThis went on for a long, long time, until, at last, there were no living\ncreatures left in the jungle but two little jackals,--a Rajah Jackal and a\nRanee Jackal--husband and wife.\n\nA very hard time of it the poor little Jackals had, running this way and that\nto escape the terrible Singh Rajah; and every day the little Ranee Jackal\nwould say to her husband, 'I am afraid he will catch us to-day,--do you hear\nhow he is roaring? Oh dear oh dear!' And he would answer her, 'Never fear; I\nwill take care of you. Let us run on a mile or two. Come, come,--quick, quick,\nquick!' And they would both run away as fast as they could.\n\nAfter some time spent in this way, they found, however, one fine day, that the\nLion was so close upon them that they could not escape. Then the little Ranee\nJackal said, 'Husband, husband! I feel very frightened. The Singh Rajah is so\nangry he will certainly kill us at once. What can we do?' But he answered,\n'Cheer up; we can save ourselves yet. Come, and I'll show you how we may\nmanage it.'\n\nSo what did these cunning little Jackals do, but they went to the great Lion's\nden; and when he saw them coming, he began to roar and shake his mane, and he\nsaid, 'You little wretches, come and be eaten at once I I have had no dinner\nfor three whole days, and all that time I have been running over hill and dale\nto find you. Ro-a-ar! Ro-a-ar! Come and be eaten, I say!' and he lashed his\ntail and gnashed his teeth, and looked very terrible indeed. Then the Jackal\nRajah, creeping quite close up to him, said, '0 great Singh Rajah, we all know\nyou are our master, and we would have come at your bidding long ago; but\nindeed, sir, there is a much bigger Rajah even than you in this jungle, and he\ntried to catch hold of us and eat us up, and frightened us so much that we\nwere obliged to run away.'\n\n'What do you mean?' growled Singh Rajab. 'There is no King in this jungle but\nme!' 'Ah, Sire,' answered the Jackal, 'in truth one would think so, for you\nare very dreadful. Your very voice is death. But it is as we say, for we, with\nour own eyes, have seen one with whom you could not compete; whose equal you\ncan no more be than we are yours; whose face is as flaming fire, his step as\nthunder, and his power supreme.' 'It is impossible!' interrupted the old Lion;\n'but show me this Rajah of whom you speak so much, that I may destroy him\ninstantly!'\n\nThen the little Jackals ran on before him until they reached a great well,\nand, pointing down to his own reflection in the water, they said, 'See, Sire,\nthere lives the terrible King of whom we spoke.' When Singh Rajah looked down\nthe well he became very angry, for he thought he saw another Lion there. He\nroared and shook his great mane, and the shadow Lion shook his, and looked\nterribly defiant. At last, beside himself with rage at the insolence of his\nopponent, Singh Rajah sprang down to kill him at once, but no other Lion was\nthere--only the treacherous reflection; and the sides of the well were so\nsteep that he could not get out again, to punish the two Jackals, who peeped\nover the top. After struggling for some time in the deep water, he sank to\nrise no more. And the little Jackals threw stones down upon him from above,\nand danced round and round the well, singing, 'Ao! Ao! Ao! Ao! The King of the\nForest is dead, is dead We have killed the great Lion who would have killed\nus! Ao! Ao! Ao! Ao! Ring-a-ting--ding-a-ting! Ring-a-ting--ding-a-ting! Ao! Ao\nl Ao!' 2\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd15.htm#fr_58) Lion King.\n\n[2](odd15.htm#fr_59) See Notes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII.
