This is the truth 1: the sacrificial works which they (the poets) saw in\nthe hymns (of the Veda) have been performed in many ways in the Treta age 2.\nPractise 3 them diligently, ye lovers of truth, this is your path that leads\nto the world of good works 4!\n\n2\\. When the fire is lighted and the flame flickers, let a man offer his\noblations between the two portions of melted butter, as an offering with\nfaith.\n\n3\\. If a man's Agnihotra sacrifice 5 is not followed\n\np. 31\n\nby the new-moon and full-moon sacrifices, by the four-months' sacrifices, and\nby the harvest sacrifice, if it is unattended by guests, not offered at all,\nor without the Vaisvadeva ceremony, or not offered according to rule, then it\ndestroys his seven worlds 1.\n\n4\\. Kali (black), Karali (terrific), Mano _g_ ava (swift as thought), Sulohita\n(very red), Sudhumravar _n_ a (purple), Sphuli\xe1\xb9\x85gini (sparkling), and the\nbrilliant Vi _s_ varupi 2 (having all forms), all these playing about are\ncalled the seven tongues (of fire).\n\n5\\. If a man performs his sacred works when these flames are shining, and the\noblations follow at the right time, then they lead him as sun-rays to where\nthe one Lord of the Devas dwells.\n\n6\\. Come hither, come hither! the brilliant oblations say to him, and carry\nthe sacrificer on the rays of the sun, while they utter pleasant speech and\npraise him, saying: 'This is thy holy Brahma-world (Svarga), gained by thy\ngood works.'\n\n7\\. But frail, in truth, are those boats, the sacrifices, the eighteen, in\nwhich this lower ceremonial has been told 3. Fools who praise this as the\nhighest good, are subject again and again to old age and death.\n\np. 32\n\n8\\. Fools dwelling in darkness, wise in their own conceit, and puffed up with\nvain knowledge, go round and round staggering to and fro, like blind men led\nby the blind 1.\n\n9\\. Children, when they have long lived in ignorance, consider themselves\nhappy. Because those who depend on their good works are, owing to their\npassions, improvident, they fall and become miserable when their life (in the\nworld which they had gained by their good works) is finished.\n\n10\\. Considering sacrifice and good works as the best, these fools know no\nhigher good, and having enjoyed (their reward) on the height of heaven, gained\nby good works, they enter again this world or a lower one.\n\n11\\. But those 2 who practise penance and faith in the forest, tranquil, wise,\nand living on alms, depart free from passion through the sun to where that\nimmortal Person dwells whose nature is imperishable 3.\n\n12\\. Let a Brahma _n_ a, after he has examined all these worlds which are\ngained by works, acquire freedom from all desires. Nothing that is eternal\n(not made) can be gained by what is not eternal (made). Let him, in order to\nunderstand this, take\n\np. 33\n\nfuel in his hand and approach a Guru who is learned and dwells entirely in\nBrahman.\n\n13\\. To that pupil who has approached him respectfully, whose thoughts are not\ntroubled by any desires, and who has obtained perfect peace, the wise teacher\ntruly told that knowledge of Brahman through which he knows the eternal and\ntrue Person.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[30:1](sbe15017.htm#fr_162) In the beginning of the second Kha _n_ _d_ a the\nlower knowledge is first described, referring to the performance of sacrifices\nand other good deeds. The reward of them is perishable, and therefore a desire\nis awakened after the higher knowledge.\n\n[30:2](sbe15017.htm#fr_163) The Treta age is frequently mentioned as the age\nof sacrifices. I should prefer, however, to take treta in the sense of trayi\nvidya, and santata as developed, because the idea that the Treta age was\ndistinguished by its sacrifices, seems to me of later origin. Even the theory\nof the four ages or yugas, though known in the Ait. Brahma _n_ a, is not\nfrequently alluded to in the older Upanishads. See Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p.\n283.\n\n[30:3](sbe15017.htm#fr_164) The termination tha for ta looks suspiciously\nBuddhistic; see 'Sanskrit Texts discovered in Japan,' J. R. A. S. 1880, p.\n180.\n\n[30:4](sbe15017.htm#fr_165) Svak _ri_ ta and suk _ri_ ta are constantly\ninterchanged. They mean the same, good deeds, or deeds performed by oneself\nand believed to be good.\n\n[30:5](sbe15017.htm#fr_166) At the Agnihotra, the first of all sacrifices, and\nthe type of many others, two portions of a _g_ ya are sacrificed on the right\nand left side of the \xc3\x82havaniya altar. The place between the two is called the\n\xc3\x82vapasthana, and here the oblations to the gods are to be offered. There are.\ntwo oblations in the morning to Surya and Pra _g_ apati, two in the evening to\nAgni and Pra _g_ apati. Other sacrifices, such as the Dar _s_ a and Pur _n_\namasa, and those mentioned in verse 3, are connected with the Agnihotra.\n\n[31:1](sbe15017.htm#fr_167) The seven worlds form the rewards of a pious\nsacrificer, the first is Bhu _h_ , the last Satya. The seven worlds may also\nbe explained as the worlds of the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,\nof the son, the grandson, and great-grandson, and of the sacrificer himself.\n\n[31:2](sbe15017.htm#fr_168) Or Vi _s_ varu _k_ i, if there is any authority\nfor this reading in Mahidhara's commentary to the Va _g_ as. Sa _m_ hita XVII,\n79. The Rajah of Besmah's edition has vi _s_ varuki, which is also the reading\nadopted by Rammohun Roy, see Complete Works, vol. i, p. 579.\n\n[31:3](sbe15017.htm#fr_169) The commentator takes the eighteen for the sixteen\npriests, the sacrificer, and his wife. But such an explanation hardly yields a\nsatisfactory meaning, nor does plava mean perishable.\n\n[32:1](sbe15017.htm#fr_170) Cf. Ka _th_. Up. II, 5.\n\n[32:2](sbe15017.htm#fr_171) According to the commentator, this verse refers to\nthose who know the uselessness of sacrifices and have attained to a knowledge\nof the qualified Brahman. They live in the forest as Vanaprasthas and Sa _m_\nnyasins, practising tapas, i.e. whatever is proper for their state, and _s_\nraddha, i.e. a knowledge of Hira _n_ yagarbha. The wise are the learned G _ri_\nhasthas, while those who live on alms are those who have forsaken their\nfamily.\n\n[32:3](sbe15017.htm#fr_172) That person is Hira _n_ yagarbha. His immortality\nis relative only, it lasts no longer than the world (sa _m_ sara).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1](sbe15018.htm)\n\n"
