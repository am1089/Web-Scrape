I will now tell\nyou exhaustively about knowledge together with experience; that being known,\nthere is nothing further left in this world to know. Among thousands of men,\nonly some 2 work for perfection 3; and even of those who have reached\nperfection, and who are assiduous, only some know me truly. Earth, water,\nfire, air, space, mind, understanding,\n\np. 74\n\nand egoism 1, thus is my nature divided eightfold. But this is a lower (form\nof my) nature. Know (that there is) another (form of my) nature, and higher\nthan this, which is animate, O you of mighty arms! and by which this universe\nis upheld. Know that all things have these (for their) source 2. I am the\nproducer and the destroyer of the whole universe. There is nothing else, O\nDhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya! higher than myself; all this is woven upon me, like numbers of\npearls upon a thread 3. I am the taste in water, O son of Kunti! I am the\nlight of the sun and moon. I am 'Om 4' in all the Vedas, sound 5 in space, and\nmanliness in human beings; I am the fragrant smell in the earth, refulgence in\nthe fire; I am life in all beings, and penance 6 in those who perform penance.\nKnow me, O son of P _ri_ tha! to be the eternal seed of all beings; I am the\ndiscernment of the discerning ones, and I the glory of the glorious 7. I am\nalso the strength, unaccompanied by fondness or desire 8, of the strong. And,\nO chief of the descendants of Bharata! I am love unopposed to piety 9 among\nall\n\np. 75\n\nbeings. And all entities which are of the quality of goodness, and those which\nare of the quality of passion and of darkness, know that they are, indeed, all\nfrom me; I am not in them, but they are in me 1. The whole universe deluded by\nthese three states of mind, developed from the qualities, does not know me,\nwho am beyond them and inexhaustible; for this delusion of mine, developed\nfrom the qualities, is divine and difficult to transcend. Those cross beyond\nthis delusion who resort to me alone. Wicked men, doers of evil (acts), who\nare deluded, who are deprived of their knowledge by (this) delusion, and who\nincline to the demoniac state of mind 2, do not resort to me. But, O Ar _g_\nuna! doers of good (acts) of four classes worship me: one who is distressed,\none who is seeking after knowledge, one who wants wealth, and one, O chief of\nthe descendants of Bharata! who is possessed of knowledge. Of these, he who is\npossessed of knowledge, who is always devoted, and whose worship is\n(addressed) to one (Being) only, is esteemed highest. For to the man of\nknowledge I am dear above all things, and he is dear to me. All these are\nnoble. But the man possessed of knowledge is deemed by me to be my own self.\nFor he with (his) self devoted to abstraction, has taken to me as the goal\nthan which there is nothing higher. At the end of many lives, the man\npossessed of knowledge approaches me, (believing) that Vasudeva is everything.\nSuch a high-souled man is very hard to find. Those who are deprived of\nknowledge by various desires approach other\n\np. 76\n\ndivinities, observing various regulations 1, and controlled by their own\nnatures 2. Whichever form (of deity) any worshipper wishes to worship with\nfaith, to that form I render his faith steady. Possessed Of that faith, he\nseeks to propitiate (the deity in) that (form), and obtains from it those\nbeneficial things which he desires, (though they are) really given by me. But\nthe fruit thus (obtained) by them, who have little judgment, is perishable.\nThose who worship the divinities go to the divinities 3, and my worshippers,\ntoo, go to me. The undiscerning ones, not knowing my transcendent and\ninexhaustible essence, than which there is nothing higher, think me, who am\nunperceived, to have become perceptible 4. Surrounded by the delusion of my\nmystic power 5, I am not manifest to all. This deluded world knows not me\nunborn and inexhaustible. I know, O Ar _g_ una! the things which have been,\nthose which are, and those which are to be. But me nobody knows. All beings, O\nterror of (your) foes! are deluded at the time of birth by the delusion, O\ndescendant of Bharata! caused by the pairs of opposites arising from desire\nand aversion. But the men of meritorious actions, whose sins have terminated,\nworship me, being released from the delusion (caused) by the pairs of\n\np. 77\n\nopposites, and being firm in their beliefs [1](sbe0810.htm#fn_288). Those who,\nresting on me, work for release from old age and death\n[2](sbe0810.htm#fn_289), know the Brahman [3](sbe0810.htm#fn_290), the whole\nAdhyatma, and all action. And those who know me with the Adhibhuta, the\nAdhidaiva, and the Adhiya _g_ \xc3\xb1a, having minds devoted to abstraction, know me\nat the time of departure (from this world).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[73:1](sbe0808.htm#fr_270) As distinguished from the others who work half-\nheartedly, so to say.

See\nchapter I. sutra 61 of the current aphorisms.\n\n[74:2](sbe0809.htm#fr_274) Cf. infra, [p. 105](sbe0815.htm#page_105).\n\n[74:3](sbe0809.htm#fr_275) Cf.

Cf.\nGoldstucker's Remains, I, 14, 122; Yoga-sutras I, 27.\n\n[74:5](sbe0809.htm#fr_277) I. e. the occult essence which underlies all these\nand the other qualities of the various things mentioned.\n\n[74:6](sbe0809.htm#fr_278) I. e. power to bear the pairs of opposites.\n\n[74:7](sbe0809.htm#fr_279) Glory here seems to mean dignity, greatness.\n\n[74:8](sbe0809.htm#fr_280) Desire is the wish to obtain new things; fondness\nis the anxiety to retain what has been obtained. The strength here spoken of,\ntherefore, is that which is applied to the performance of one's own duties\nonly.\n\n[74:9](sbe0809.htm#fr_281) I. e. indulged within the bounds allowed by the\nrules of the _S_ astras, namely, for the procreation of sons &c. only.\n\n[75:1](sbe0809.htm#fr_282) They do not dominate over me, I rule them.\n\n[75:2](sbe0809.htm#fr_283) Infra, [p. 115](sbe0818.htm#page_115).\n\n[76:1](sbe0809.htm#fr_284) Fasts and so forth.\n\n[76:2](sbe0809.htm#fr_285) Which are the result of the actions done in\nprevious lives.\n\n[76:3](sbe0809.htm#fr_286) And the divinities are not eternal, so the fruit\nobtained is ephemeral.\n\n[76:4](sbe0809.htm#fr_287) The ignorant do not know the real divinity of Vish\n_n_ u, thinking him to be no higher than as he is seen in the human form. This\ngives them an inadequate notion of the purity and eternity of the happiness to\nbe obtained by worshipping him; cf. infra, [p. 83](sbe0811.htm#page_83).\n\n[76:5](sbe0809.htm#fr_288) The veil surrounding me is created by my mysterious\npower, and that everybody cannot pierce through; cf.
