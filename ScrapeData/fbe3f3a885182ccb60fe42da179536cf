Therefore he shall always\ncarry one.\' 1\n\n\'He who desires his own welfare, shall use it without hesitation, for\npurifying (his person), for drinking, and for performing his twilight\ndevotions.\'\n\n2\\. Let him do it with a believing heart; a wise man must not corrupt his\nmind. The self-existent 2\n\np. 164\n\n[paragraph continues] (Brahman) came into existence with a water-vessel.\nTherefore let him perform (his rites) with a water-vessel.\n\n3\\. Let him hold it in his right hand when he voids urine and excrements, in\nthe left when he sips water. That is (a) settled (rule) for all good men.\n\n4\\. For as the sacrificial cusp ( _k_ amasa) is declared to be pure on account\nof its contact with the Soma-juice, even so the water-vessel is constantly\npure through its contact with water.\n\n5\\. Therefore let him avoid (to use) it for the worship of the manes, the\ngods, and the fire. 5\n\n6\\. Therefore let him not go on a journey without a waterpot, nor to the\nboundary of the village, nor from one house to the other.\n\n7\\. Some (declare that he must not go without it) a step further than the\nlength of an arrow.\n\n8\\. Baudhayana (says that he shall not go without it) if he wishes to fulfil\nhis duties constantly.\n\n9\\. (The divine) Word declares that (this is con-firmed) by a _Ri_ k-shaped\n(passage). 9\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[163:1](sbe1440.htm#fr_822) **7**. The division of this chapter into two\nsections occurs in the M. manuscript only. The Dekhan MSS., which give the\ndivision into Ka _n_ _d_ ikas, do not note it, and have at the end of the Pra\n_s_ na the figure 20, while M. has 21 and in words ekavi _m_ _s_ ati _h_ after\nthe enumeration of the Pratikas.\n\n[163:2](sbe1440.htm#fr_823) \'A wise man must not corrupt his mind,\' i.e. must\nnot doubt or adopt erroneous views regarding the teaching of the _S_ astras\nwith respect to the waterpot. It seems to me that this passage indicates the\nexistence of an opposition to the constant carrying of the waterpot in\nBaudhayana\'s times. This is so much more probable, as the custom is now\nobsolete, and is mentioned in some Pura _n_ as and versified Sm _ri_ tis as\none of the practices forbidden in the Kali age; see e _g_. the general note\nappended to Sir W. Jones\' translation of Manu.\n\n[164:5](sbe1440.htm#fr_824) According to Govinda the word \'therefore\' refers\nback to Sutra I, 4, 6, 14.\n\n[164:9](sbe1440.htm#fr_825) \' _Ri_ gvidham, "a _Ri_ k-shaped (passage)," means\n_Ri_ gvidhanam, "a prescription consisting of a _Ri_ k." The Brahma _n_ a is\nindicated by (the word) vak, ("the goddess of) speech." The meaning is, "The\nBrahma _n_ a says that there is also a _Ri_ k-verse to this effect. That is as\nfollows, tasyaisha bhavati yat te _s_ ilpam ityadi\' (Taittiriya-\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka\nI, 7, a).--Govinda.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 5, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 8](sbe1441.htm)\n\n'
