He shall retire to rest after having received (the teacher's permission).\n2\n\n3\\. And he shall not stretch out his feet towards him.\n\n4\\. Some say, that it is not (sinful) to stretch out the feet (towards the\nteacher), if he be lying on a bed. 4\n\n5\\. And he shall not address (the teacher), whilst he himself is in a\nreclining position. 5\n\n6\\. But he may answer (the teacher) sitting (if the teacher himself is sitting\nor lying down). 6\n\n7\\. And if (the teacher) stands, (he shall answer him,) after having risen\nalso.\n\np. 23\n\n8\\. He shall walk after him, if he walks.\n\n9\\. He shall run after him, if he runs.\n\n10\\. He shall not approach (his teacher) with shoes on his feet, or his head\ncovered, or holding (implements) in his hand.\n\n11\\. But on a journey or occupied in work, he may approach him (with shoes on,\nwith his head covered, or with implements in his hand),\n\n12\\. Provided he does not sit down quite near (to his teacher).\n\n13\\. He shall approach his teacher with the same reverence as a deity, without\ntelling idle stories, attentive and listening eagerly to his words.\n\n14\\. (He shall not sit near him). with his legs crossed.\n\n15\\. If (on sitting down) the wind blows from the pupil towards the master, he\nshall change his place. 15\n\n16\\. (He shall sit) without supporting himself with his hands (on the ground),\n\n17\\. Without leaning against something (as a wall or the like).\n\n18\\. If the pupil wears two garments, he shall wear the upper one after the\nfashion of the sacred thread at the sacrifices. 18\n\n19\\. But, if he wears a (lower) garment only, he shall wrap it around the\nlower part of his body.\n\n20\\. He shall turn his face towards his teacher though the latter does not\nturn his towards him. 20\n\n21\\. He shall sit neither too near to, nor too far (from the teacher),\n\np. 24\n\n22\\. (But) at such a distance, that (the teacher) may be able to reach him\nwith his arms (without rising).\n\n23\\. (He shall not sit in such a position) that the wind blows from the\nteacher, towards himself. 23\n\n24\\. (If there is) only one pupil, he shall sit at the right hand (of the\nteacher).\n\n25\\. (If there are) many, (they may sit) as it may be convenient.\n\n26\\. If the master (is not honoured with a seat and) stands, the (pupil) shall\nnot sit down.\n\n27\\. (If the master is not honoured with a couch) and sits, the (pupil) shall\nnot lie down on a couch.\n\n28\\. And if the teacher tries (to do something), then (the pupil) shall offer\nto do it for him, if it is in his power.\n\n29\\. And, if his teacher is near, he shall not embrace (the feet of) another\nGuru who is inferior (in dignity), 29\n\n30\\. Nor shall he praise (such a person in the teacher's presence) by\n(pronouncing the name of) his family.\n\n31\\. Nor, shall he rise to meet such an (inferior Guru) or rise after him, 31\n\n32\\. Even if he be a Guru of his teacher.\n\n33\\. But he shall leave his place and his seat, (in order to show him honour.)\n\np. 25\n\n34\\. Some say, that (he may address) a pupil of his teacher by (pronouncing)\nhis name, if he is also one of his (the pupil's) own Gurus. 34\n\n35\\. But towards such a person who is generally revered for some other reason\nthan being the teacher (e.g. for his learning), the (student) should behave as\ntowards his teacher, though he be inferior in dignity to the latter.\n\n36\\. After having eaten in his (teacher's) presence, he shall not give away\nthe remainder of the food without rising. 36\n\n37\\.
