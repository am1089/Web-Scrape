The ether, on account of the designation of something different, and so\non.\n\nWe read in the _Kh_ andogya. \'The ether is the evolver of forms and names.\nThat within which these forms and names are (or "that which is within--or\nwithout--these forms and names") is Brahman, the Immortal, the Self\' (VIII,\n14). A doubt here arises whether the being here called ether be the released\nindividual soul, or the highest Self.--The Purvapakshin adopts the former\nview. For, he says, the released soul is introduced as subject-matter in an\nimmediately preceding clause,\'Shaking off all as a horse shakes his hair, and\nas the moon frees himself from the mouth of Rahu; having shaken off the body I\nobtain, satisfied, the uncreated world of Brahman\' Moreover, the clause \'That\nwhich is without forms and names\' clearly designates the released soul freed\nfrom name and form. And \'the evolver of names and forms\' is again that same\nsoul characterised with a view to its previous condition; for the individual\nsoul in its non-released state supported the shapes of gods, and so on, and\ntheir names. With a view, finally, to its present state in which it is free\nfrom name and form, the last clause declares \'that is Brahman, the Immortal\'.\nThe term \'ether\' may very well be applied to the released soul which is\ncharacterised by the possession of non-limited splendour.--But, as the text\nunder discussion is supplementary to the section dealing with the small ether\nwithin the heart (VIII, 1, 1 ff.), we understand that\n\np. 350\n\nthat small ether is referred to here also; and it has been proved above that\nthat small ether is Brahman!--Not so, we reply. The text under discussion is\nseparated from the section treating of the small ether within the heart, by\nthe teaching of Pra _g_ apati. and that teaching is concerned with the\ncharacteristics of the individual soul in its different conditions up to\nRelease; and moreover the earlier part of the section under discussion speaks\nof the being which shakes off evil, and this undoubtedly is the released\nindividual soul introduced in the teaching of Pra _g_ apati. All this shows\nthat the ether in our passage denotes the released individual soul.\n\nThis view is set aside by the Sutra. The ether in our passage is the highest\nBrahman, because the clause \'Ether is the evolver of forms and names\'\ndesignates something other than the individual soul. The ether which evolves\nnames and forms cannot be the individual soul either in the state of bondage\nor that of release. In the state of bondage the soul is under the influence of\nkarman, itself participates in name and form, and hence cannot bring about\nnames and forms. And in its released state it is expressly said not to take\npart in the world-business (Ve. Su. IV, 4, 17), and therefore is all the less\nqualified to evolve names and forms. The Lord, on the other hand, who is the\nruling principle in the construction of the Universe is expressly declared by\nscripture to be the evolver of names and forms; cp. \'Entering into them with\nthis living Self, let me evolve names and forms\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2); \'Who\nis all-knowing, whose brooding consists of knowledge, from him is born this\nBrahman, name, form, and matter\' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9), &c. Hence the ether which\nbrings about names and forms is something different from the soul for which\nname and form are brought about; it is in fact the highest Brahman. This the\nnext clause of the text confirms, \'That which is within those forms and\nnames\'; the purport of which is: because that ether is within names and forms,\nnot being touched by them but being something apart, therefore it is the\nevolver of them; this also following from his being free from evil and endowed\nwith the power of realising his\n\np. 351\n\npurposes. The \'and so on\' in the Sutra refers to the Brahma-hood, Self-hood,\nand immortality mentioned in the text (\'That is the Brahman, the Immortal, the\nSelf\'). For Brahma-hood, i.e. greatness, and so on, in their unconditioned\nsense, belong to the highest Self only. It is thus clear that the ether is the\nhighest Brahman.--Nor is the Purvapakshin right in maintaining that a clause\nimmediately preceding (\'shaking off all evil\') introduces the individual soul\nas the general topic of the section. For what the part of the text immediately\npreceding the passage under discussion does introduce as general topic, is the\nhighest Brahman, as shown by the clause \'I obtain the Brahma-world.\' Brahman\nis, it is true, represented there as the object to be obtained by the released\nsoul; but as the released soul cannot be the cvolver of names and forms, &c.,\nwe must conclude that it is Brahman (and not the released soul), which\nconstitutes the topic of the whole section. Moreover (to take a wider view of\nthe context of our passage) the term \'ether\' prompts us to recognise here the\nsmall ether (mentioned in the first section of the eighth book) as the general\ntopic of the book; and as the teaching of Pra _g_ apati is meant to set forth\n(not the individual soul by itself but) the nature of the soul of the\nmeditating devotee, it is proper to conclude that the text under discussion is\nmeant finally to represent, as the object to be obtained, the small ether\npreviously inculcated as object of meditation. In conclusion we remark that\nthe term \'ether\' is nowhere seen to denote the individual Self.--The ether\nthat evolves names and forms, therefore, is the highest Brahman.\n\nBut, an objection is raised, there is no other Self different from the\nindividual Self; for scripture teaches the unity of all Sclfs and denies\nduality. Terms such as \'the highest Self, \'the highest Brahman,\' \'the highest\nLord,\' are merely designations of the individual soul in the state of Release.\nThe Brahma-world to be attained, therefore, is nothing different from the\nattaining individual soul; and hence the ether also that evolves names and\nforms can be that soul only.--To this objection the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 43.
