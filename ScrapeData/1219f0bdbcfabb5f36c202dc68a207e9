Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: O Lord of the Holy Ones, tell me about the eleventh-day rite\nalso, and, O Ruler of the universe, explain the ceremony of the dedication of\nthe bull.\n\n2\\. The Blessed Lord said: In the early morning on the eleventh day one should\ngo to a water-reservoir, and perform diligently all the funeral ceremonies.\n\n3\\. He should invite Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s, well-read in Vedas and \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras, and bowing\ntheir heads, with hands folded together, pray for the release of the departed.\n\n4\\. Even a preceptor should become purified by bathing, and performing the\n_Sandhy \xc4\x81_ and other ceremonies 1; one should do the eleventh-day ceremony, as\nprescribed.\n\n5\\. One should perform the tenth-day \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha in the family name, without\nmantras; and on the eleventh day, offer a rice-ball to the departed, with\nmantras.\n\np. 104\n\n6-10. One should make a golden image of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, a silver one of Brahm\xc4\x81, a\ncopper one of Rudra, and an iron one of Yama, O Bird.\n\nTo the west there should be a pot filled with Ganges water for Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u; and upon\nit one should place Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, clad in yellow robes.\n\nTo the east there should be a pot of milk and water for Brahma; and there one\nshould place Brahm\xc4\x81, clad in white robes.\n\nTo the north there should be a pot of honey and clarified butter for Rudra,\nand there one should place Rudra, clad in red robes.\n\nTo the south there should be a pot of rain-water for Yama; and upon it one\nshould place Yama, clad in black robes.\n\n11-13. The son, having made a circle in the middle, and placed therein ku\xc5\x9ba-\ngrass, facing southward, with the sacred thread over the right shoulder 1,\nshould make the water-offering.\n\nHe should make water-offering, with Vaidic mantras, to Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, to the creator\n2, to \xc5\x9aiva and to Justice, 3 perform the offering to the fire and then the\neleventh-day \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha,\n\nAnd he should next make a gift of a cow for the helping along of his\nforefathers: "this cow is given by me. May it please Thee, O M\xc4\x81dhava."\n\np. 105\n\n12-15. His clothes, his ornaments, his conveyances,--these, which he has used,\n--a brass vessel filled with clarified butter, the seven grains which he\nliked,\n\nSesamum and the rest, the eight great gifts: if one does not offer these in\nhis last days, they should be brought to his bedside and he should have them\ngiven.\n\n16\\. Having washed the feet of a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 he should honour him with cloths and\nother things, and give him cooked food, sweetmeats, flour-cakes and milk.\n\n17-.19. Then the son should place upon the bed a golden image, and having\nworshiped it, give the bed as prescribed, for the sake of the dead.\n\n"This bed is given by me to you, O Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87, for the sake of the departed, with\nthe image of the departed, and the other things."\n\nWith these words it should be given to a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 preceptor who has a family;\nso going round him he should salute him and present it.\n\n20\\. By this gift of the bed, and \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddhas of the ninth and other days, and by\nthe [rite](errata.htm#9) of the dedication of a bull, the departed goes to the\nhighest condition.\n\np. 106\n\n21-30. On the eleventh day the [rite](errata.htm#10) of the dedication of a\nbull should be performed as prescribed. He should not use a cow which is\ncrippled, ill or too young, but one having well-marked characteristics.\n\nThat which has red eyes, a reddish colour, red horns, neck and hoofs, white\nbelly and black back is suitable for a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87;\n\nA glossy and red complexion is suitable for a K\xe1\xb9\xa3attriya; yellow colour for a\nVai\xc5\x9bya; black is suitable for a \xc5\x9a\xc5\xabdra.\n\nOne with all limbs red-brown, with tail and feet white, is called a reddish\nbull, and increases the satisfaction of the forefathers.\n\nThe bull whose face, legs and tail are white, and which is the colour of lac\ndye is called dark.\n\nThat which has a red colour, with white face and tail, and brown hoofs and\nhorns is called dark-coloured.\n\nThat which has one colour over all its limbs and tail and hoofs is called\ndark-brown, and is the uplifter of the ancestors.\n\nThat which is dove-coloured and has a tilaka-mark 1 on its forehead is called\ndeep-brown, and is entirely beautiful in all its limbs.\n\nThat which is dark over all its body, and red in its eyes, is called very dark\n--of which five varieties are known.\n\nThis should by all means be dedicated, and should not be used for domestic\npurposes. It exists in the world on this account,--so runs an ancient saying.\n\np. 107\n\n31-35. One should desire for many sons, of whom one perchance may go to Gay\xc4\x81,\nor marry a virgin Gaur\xc4\xab or dedicate a dark bull.\n\nHe alone should be considered a son who performs the dedication of a bull and\nthe Gay\xc4\x81 \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha---who does not do so verily is like unto excrement.\n\nAny one whose ancestors are tormented in Raurava and other hells helps them\nall out for twenty-one generations by the dedication of a bull.\n\nEven the forefathers who have gone to heaven desire the dedication of a bull:\n"which son in our lineage will perform the dedication of a bull,\n\n"By whose dedication, all of us will go to the highest condition? Among all\nsacrifices, the bull-sacrifice is the certain giver of release to us."\n\n36\\. Therefore, for the release of the forefathers, one should perform the\nbull-sacrifice. He should do everything with diligence according to the\nprescribed rite.\n\n37\\. Having cast the positions of the planets and worshipped them with their\nrespective mantras, the ailing man should make the fire-offering, according to\nthe \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras, and worship a bull.\n\np. 108\n\n38-42. Having brought together a young bull and cow, he should bind them\ntogether with a marriage string in accordance with marriage rites, and then\ntether them to a post;\n\nAnd should bathe the bull and young cow with the water from the pot of Rudra,\nand, having worshipped them with fragrances and garlands, walk round them.\n\nHe should [mark] the right side with the trident of \xc5\x9aiva and the, left side\nwith a discus. Having released the bull, the son, with hands folded together,\nshould recite this mantra:--\n\n"Thou art Justice in the form of a bull. Thou wert formerly created by Brahma.\nOn account of your being released, help over this ocean of existence!"\n\nHaving thus bowed to it, with this mantra, he should release the bull and the\nyoung cow. "I shall always be the grantor of boons to you, and will give\nrelease to the departed."\n\n43\\. Therefore this should be done. Its fruit comes even during life. The man\nwho has no son, doing it himself, goes easily to the highest condition.\n\n44-45. In the month of K\xc4\x81rtika 1 and in other auspicious months, when the sun\nis going north, in the bright fortnight, or the dark on the twelfth and\nfollowing days,\n\nIn the two eclipses, at a sacred bathing place, at the equinoctial and\nsolstitial points, one should perform the dedication of a bull.\n\np. 109\n\n46-49. At the hour when the sun enters an auspicious constellation, and in a\npure place, a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 who knows the rites and has the auspicious signs should\nbe invited.\n\nBy recitation, by fire-offerings, likewise by gifts, the purification of the\nbody should be done. As in the former case, all the rites should be done; such\nas the fire-offering and the rest;\n\nAnd having placed a \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81lagr\xc4\x81ma one should do the Vai\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87ava \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha, and then\nperform the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha for himself and give gifts to the twice-born.\n\nHe who does this, O Bird, whether having a son or not, by the performance of\nthe dedication of a bull obtains the fruit of all his desires.\n\n50\\. That condition which is obtained by the performance of the release of a\nbull, is not reached by oblations to the fire and other sacrifices, nor by\nmanifold gifts.\n\n51-53. The sins which are committed in infancy, in childhood, in youth, in\nmanhood and in old age are destroyed, without doubt, by the dedication of a\nbull.\n\nThe betrayer of friends, the ungrateful, the drinker of intoxicants, he who\ngoes with his teacher\'s wife, the slayer of a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87, the stealer of gold are\nall absolved by the dedication of a bull.\n\nTherefore should one perform the bull sacrifice with all diligence, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya;\nthere is no merit in all the three worlds equal to that from the dedication of\na bull.\n\n54\\. If a woman, having a husband and a son, predeceases both, the dedication\nof a bull should not be performed,--one should present a milk-giving cow.\n\np. 110\n\n55-56. He who burdens a bull on the shoulder or on the back, falls into a\ndreadful hell, O bird! until the coming of the deluge.\n\nThe man who cruelly strikes a bull with his fists or with sticks, suffers the\ntorments of Yama until the end of the age.\n\n57-59. Having thus carried out the dedication of a bull, one should perform\nthe sixteen \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddhas. I will tell you what should be done prior to\nsapi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\xabkara\xe1\xb9\x87a ceremony.\n\nThat at the place of death; at the threshold; half-way on the road; at the\nfuneral pyre; in the hand of the corpse; and at the collection of the\nbones;--these six, and the ten pi\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8das given in the ten days:--\n\nThese first sixteen are called impure. And next I will tell you about the\nsecond, the [middle](errata.htm#11), sixteen:--\n\n30-64. One should offer the first rice-ball to Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, the second to the\nblessed \xc5\x9aiva; one should present the third to the retinue of Yama.\n\nThe fourth to king Soma, the fifth to the bearer of oblations to the Shining\nOnes, 1 and the sixth to the bearer of oblations to the forefather; the\nseventh one should present to Death;\n\np. 111\n\nThe eighth one should give to Rudra, 1 the ninth to Puru\xe1\xb9\xa3a, 2 the tenth to the\ndeparted, and the eleventh reverently to Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u;\n\nThe twelfth one should give to Brahm\xc4\x81, the thirteenth to Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, the fourteenth\nto \xc5\x9aiva, the fifteenth to Yama;\n\nThe sixteenth rice-ball, O bird, one should give to Puru\xe1\xb9\xa3a: These are called\nthe middle sixteen by men who know the truth.\n\n65-67, One should give rice-balls in each one of the twelve months, on the\nfortnight, the third fortnight, before the six months, and also before the\nyear,--\n\nThis is the last sixteen, I have declared to you. Having had food cooked, O\nT\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya.\n\nThe forty-eight \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddhas destroy the condition of the ghost-life. He for whom\nthis series is performed becomes a member of the assembly of the forefathers.\n\n68-69. The three sixteens should be performed so that the departed may join\nthe assembly of the forefathers; if deprived of \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddhas the ghost remains as\npreta always.\n\nIf the performance of the three sixteens of \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddhas is not carried out,\neither by himself or another, then he certainly does not join them.\n\np. 112\n\n70-72. Therefore the three sixteens should be performed by the son, as\nprescribed, or if the wife does them for the husband there is uninterrupted\nprosperity.\n\nShe who does the funeral ceremonies on the death of her husband, and the\nannual and the fortnightly is called by me, "the Faithful."\n\nThis faithful wife lives for the good of her husband: the life is fruitful of\nher who worships her dead lord.\n\n73-78. Also, for any one who, owing to carelessness, is killed by fire, or by\nwater, one should perform the sacrament and other rites as prescribed.\n\nIf he is killed through recklesness or wilfully, or by a serpent, then me\nshould worship a serpent on the fifth day of each fortnight.\n\nOne should form a picture of a hooded serpent upon the ground with ricepowder,\nand worship with white sweet-smelling flowers and sandalpaste.\n\nOne should offer a serpent incenses and lights, much strew rice and sesamum,\nand should dedicate 1 uncooked rice-flour, 2 eatables and milk.\n\nOne should offer a serpent made of gold, according to his means, and a cow, to\na twice-born. Then one should, with hands together "may the King of Serpents\nbe pleased;"\n\nAnd should further perform for them the rite N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a-bali, by which they are\nabsolved of all sins and obtain residence in heaven,\n\np. 113\n\n79\\. Thus, having done all the rites, one should give every day a jar with\nfood and water until the end of the year, or rice-balls with water regularly.\n\n80\\. Having done this on the eleventh day he should then offer the rice-balls\nfor all the ancestors, 1 and when free from pollution he should have made a\ngift of a bed and other gifts.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[103:1](gpu14.htm#fr_119) For an account of these ceremonies, see the _Daily\nPractice of the Hindus_ by Mr. Sris Chandra Vasu, Panini Office, Allahabad.\n\n[104:1](gpu14.htm#fr_120) It is usually worn ever the left shoulder under the\nright arm, for this ceremony, he mast change it.\n\n[104:2](gpu14.htm#fr_121) Brahm\xc4\x81.\n\n[104:3](gpu14.htm#fr_122) Dharma or Yama.\n\n[106:1](gpu14.htm#fr_123) Orthodox Hindus place a mark on the forehead to show\ncaste and other things.\n\n[108:1](gpu14.htm#fr_124) Including the latter part of October and the first\npart of November.\n\n[110:1](gpu14.htm#fr_125) That is Fire.\n\n[111:1](gpu14.htm#fr_126) \xc5\x9aiva.\n\n[111:2](gpu14.htm#fr_127) The primeval man; Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\n[112:1](gpu14.htm#fr_128) The food is placed near the image, and passes of the\nhands are made as though a influence it towards the image.\n\n[112:2](gpu14.htm#fr_129) Made into a ball, usually with sugar and cocoanut.\n\n[113:1](gpu14.htm#fr_130) This ceremony is performed on the twelfth day, as it\nwere in anticipation of the annual event.
