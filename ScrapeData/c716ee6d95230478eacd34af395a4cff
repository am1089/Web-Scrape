And on account of abiding and eating.\n\n'Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same tree. One of them eats the\nsweet fruit; without eating, the other looks on' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1). This\ntext declares that one enjoys the fruit of works while the other, without\nenjoying, shining abides within the body. Now this shining being which does\nnot enjoy the fruit of works can only be the being previously described as the\nabode of heaven, earth, &c., and characterised as all knowing, the bridge of\nimmortality, the Self of all; it can in no way be the individual Self which,\nlamenting, experiences the results of its works. The settled conclusion,\ntherefore, is that the abode of heaven, earth, and so on, is none other than\nthe highest Self.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'heaven, earth, and\nso on.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7.
