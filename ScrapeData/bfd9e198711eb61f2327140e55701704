The fore-offerings (praya _g_ a), assuredly, are the seasons: hence\nthere are five of them, for there are five seasons.\n\n1:5:3:22\\. The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprang from Pra _g_ apati,\nwere once contending for this sacrifice, (which is) their father Pra _g_\napati, the year: \'Ours it (he) shall be!\' \'Ours it (he) shall be!\' they said.\n\n1:5:3:33\\. Then the gods went on praising and toiling. They saw these fore-\nofferings and worshipped with them. By means of them they gained (pra- _g_ i)\nthe seasons, the year; they deprived their rivals of the seasons, of the year:\nhence (the fore-offerings are) victories (pra _g_ aya), for, assuredly, pra\n_g_ aya is the very same term as praya _g_ a (fore-offering) 1. And in the\nsame way this one (the sacrificer) wins by means of them the seasons, the\nyear; deprives his rivals of the seasons, of the year. This is the reason why\nhe performs the fore-offerings.\n\n1:5:3:44\\. The sacrificial food at these offerings consists of\n\np. 145\n\nclarified butter. Now the butter, indeed, is a thunderbolt, and with that\nthunderbolt, the butter, the gods gained the seasons, the year, and deprived\ntheir rivals of the seasons, of the year. And with that thunderbolt, the\nbutter, he now, in the same way, gains the seasons, the year, and deprives his\nenemies of the seasons, of the year. For this reason clarified butter forms\nthe sacrificial food at these (offerings).\n\n1:5:3:55\\. Now this butter is the year\'s own liquor: hence the gods gained it\n(the year) by means of its own liquor; and in the same way he also now gains\nit by means of its own liquor. This is the reason why clarified butter forms\nthe sacrificial food at these (fore-offerings).\n\n1:5:3:66\\. Let him (the Adhvaryu) not move from that same spot where he may be\nstanding when he calls for the fore-offerings. A battle, it is true, is\nwitnessed whenever any one performs the fore-offerings, and whichever of the\ntwo combatants is worsted, that one, no doubt, retreats; and he who obtains\nthe victory, advances still nearer: he (the Adhvaryu) might therefore (feel\ninclined to) step nearer and nearer (to the fire), and offer the oblations\n(while moving) nearer and nearer 1.\n\n1:5:3:77\\. This, however, he should not do; he should not move from that same\nspot where he may be standing when he calls for the fore-offerings. Let\n\np. 146\n\nhim rather offer the (five) oblations in that part (of the fire) where he\nthinks there is the fiercest blaze; for only by being offered in blazing\n(fire), oblations are successful.\n\n1:5:3:88\\. He (the Adhvaryu), having called (on, and having been responded to\nby, the \xc3\x82gnidhra), says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Pronounce the offering-prayer (ya\n_g_ ya) to the Samidhs (kindling-sticks)!\' Thereby he kindles the spring; the\nspring, when kindled, kindles the other seasons; the seasons, when kindled,\ngenerate the creatures and ripen the plants. In the same (formula) he also\nimplies the (four) remaining seasons, and in order to avoid sameness, he\nintroduces the others by merely saying each time, \'Pronounce the offering-\nprayer!\' For were he to say, \'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Tanunapat!\'\n\'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the I _d_ s!\' and so on, he would commit\n(the fault of) repetition: hence he introduces the remaining (seasons or fore-\nofferings) by merely saying each time, \'Pronounce the offering-prayer 1!\'\n\n1:5:3:99\\. He (the Hot _ri_ ) now pronounces the offering-prayer (ya _g_ ya)\nto the Samidhs. The samidh (kindler), doubtless, is the spring. The gods, at\nthat time, appropriated the spring, and deprived their rivals of the spring;\nand now this one (the\n\np. 147\n\nsacrificer) also appropriates the spring, and deprives his rivals of the\nspring: this is the reason why he pronounces the offering-prayer to the\nSamidhs.\n\n1:5:3:1010\\. After that he pronounces the offering-prayer to Tanunapat.\nTanunapat, doubtless, is the summer; for the summer burns the bodies (tanun\ntapati) of these creatures. The gods, at that time, appropriated the summer,\nand deprived their rivals of the summer; and now this one also appropriates\nthe summer, and deprives his rivals of the summer: this is the reason why he\npronounces the offering-prayer to Tanunapat.\n\n1:5:3:1111\\. He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the I _d_ s. The I _d_\ns (praises), doubtless, are the rains; they are the rains, inasmuch as the\nvile, crawling (vermin) 1 which shrink during the summer and winter, then (in\nthe rainy season) move about in quest of food, as it were, praising (i _d_ )\nthe rains: therefore the I _d_ s are the rains. The gods, at that time,\nappropriated the rains, and deprived their rivals of the rains; and now this\none also appropriates the rains, and deprives his rivals of the rains: this is\nthe reason why he pronounces the offering-prayer to the I _d_ s.\n\n1:5:3:1212\\. He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the Barhis (covering of\nsacrificial grass on the altar). The barhis, doubtless, is the autumn; the\nbarhis is the autumn, inasmuch as these plants which shrink during the summer\nand winter grow by the rains, and in autumn lie spread open after the fashion\nof barhis: for this reason the barhis is the autumn. The gods, at that time,\nappropriated the autumn, and deprived their rivals of the autumn;\n\np. 148\n\nand now this one also appropriates the autumn, and deprives his rivals of the\nautumn: this is why he pronounces the prayer to the barhis.\n\n1:5:3:1313\\. He then pronounces the offering-prayer with \'Svaha! Svaha 1!\' The\nSvaha-call, namely, marks the end of the sacrifice, and the end of the year is\nthe winter, since the winter is on the other (remoter) side of the spring. By\nthe end (of the sacrifice) the gods, at that time, appropriated the end (of\nthe year); by the end they deprived their rivals of the end; and by the end\nthis one also now appropriates the end; by the end he deprives his rivals of\nthe end: this is why he pronounces the offering-prayers with \'Svaha! Svaha!\'\n\n1:5:3:1414\\. Now the spring, assuredly, comes into life again out of the\nwinter, for out of the one the other is born again: therefore he who knows\nthis, is indeed born again in this world.\n\n1:5:3:1515\\. In order to avoid sameness he prays (alternately) with \'may they\naccept!\' and \'may he (or it) accept 2!\' for he would commit (the fault) of\nrepetition,\n\np. 149\n\nif he were to pray with \'may they accept!\' each time, or with \'may he accept!\'\neach time. By \'may they accept!\' doubtless, females (are implied); and by \'may\nhe accept!\' a male (is implied): thereby a productive union is effected, and\nfor this reason he prays (alternately) with \'may they accept!\' and \'may he (or\nit) accept!\'\n\n1:5:3:1616\\. Now at the fourth fore-offering, to the barhis, he pours (butter)\ntogether (into the _g_ uhu 1). The barhis, namely, represents descendants, and\nthe butter seed: hence seed is thereby infused into the descendants, and by\nthat infused seed descendants are generated again and again. For this reason\nhe pours together (butter) at the fourth fore-offering, that to the barhis.\n\n1:5:3:1717\\. Now, a battle, as it were, is going on here when any one performs\nthe fore-offerings; and whichever of the two combatants a friend (an ally)\njoins, he obtains the victory: hence a friend thereby joins the _g_ uhu from\nout of the upabh _ri_ t, and by him it (or he) obtains the victory. This is\nwhy he pours together (butter) at the fourth fore-offering, that to the\nbarhis.\n\n1:5:3:1818\\. The sacrificer, doubtless, (stands) behind the _g_ uhu, and he\nwho means evil to him, (stands)\n\np. 150\n\nbehind the upabh _ri_ t: hence he thereby makes the spiteful enemy pay tribute\nto the sacrificer. The consumer, doubtless, (stands) behind the _g_ uhu, and\nthe one to be consumed behind the upabh _ri_ t hence he thereby makes the one\nthat is to be consumed pay tribute to the consumer. This is the reason why he\npours (butter) together at the fourth fore-offering, that to the barhis.\n\n1:5:3:1919\\. He pours (the butter) together without (the two spoons) touching\n(each other). If he were to touch (the one spoon with the other) he would\ntouch the sacrificer with his spiteful enemy, he would touch the consumer with\nthe one to be consumed: for this reason he pours (the butter) together without\ntouching.\n\n1:5:3:2020\\. He holds the _g_ uhu over the upabh _ri_ t). Thereby he keeps the\nsacrificer above his spiteful enemy, he keeps the consumer above the one to be\nconsumed: for this reason he holds the _g_ uhu over (the upabh _ri_ t).\n\n1:5:3:2121\\. The gods once said, \'Well then, now that the battle has been won,\nlet us establish the entire sacrifice on a firm basis; and should the Asuras\nand Rakshas (again) trouble us, our sacrifice will then be firmly\nestablished!\'\n\n1:5:3:2222\\. At the last fore-offering they established the entire sacrifice\nby means of the Svaha (\'hail!\'). With \'Svaha Agni!\' they established the\nbutter-portion for Agni; with \'Svaha Soma!\' they established the butter-\nportion for Soma; and with (the second) \'Svaha Agni!\' they established that\nindispensable sacrificial cake which there is on both occasions (i.e. at the\nnew- and full-moon sacrifices).\n\n1:5:3:2323\\. And so with the (other) deities\n\np. 151\n\nrespectively 1. With \'Svaha the butter-drinking gods!\' they established the\nfore-offerings and the after-offerings (anuya _g_ as), for the fore-offerings\nand after-offerings, doubtless, represent the butter-drinking gods. With the\nformula \'May Agni graciously accept of the butter!\' they established Agni as\nSvish _t_ ak _ri_ t (\'maker of good offering\'), for Agni is indeed the maker\nof good offering. And till this day that sacrifice stands as firm as the gods\nestablished it. This is the reason why at the last fore-offering he prays with\nSvaha! Svaha!\' according to the number of oblations (there are at the chief\nsacrifice). After he (the sacrificer) has won his battle, he establishes the\nentire sacrifice on a firm basis, so that, if after this he should violate the\nproper order of the sacrifice, he need not heed it; for he will know that his\nsacrifice is firmly established. Now what with exclaiming \'Vashat,\' with\noffering, and with calling out \'Svaha,\' this same sacrifice was well-nigh\nexhausted.\n\n1:5:3:2424\\. The gods were anxious as to how they might replenish it, how they\nmight again render it efficient and practise (worshipping) with it, when\nefficient.\n\n1:5:3:2525\\. Now what was left in the _g_ uhu of the butter wherewith they had\nestablished the sacrifice, with that they sprinkled the havis (dishes, or\nkinds, of sacrificial food) one after another, and thereby replenished them\nand again rendered them efficient, because the butter is indeed efficient.\nHence after offering the last fore-offering, he sprinkles the havis one after\nanother, and thereby replenishes them and again renders them efficient,\nbecause the butter is indeed efficient 2. Hence also from whatever sacrificial\n\np. 152\n\nfood he (afterwards at the principal oblations) cuts off (a portion for a\ndeity), that he again sprinkles (with butter), that he replenishes and renders\nefficient for the (Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t) maker of good offering. But when he\ncuts off the portion for the maker of good offering, then he does not again\nsprinkle (the sacrificial food out of which the portion has been cut), since\nafter that he will not make any other oblation in the fire from the\nsacrificial food 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[144:1](sbe1224.htm#fr_358) In reality praya _g_ a (from ya _g_ , \'to\nsacrifice\') has, of course, nothing to do with pra _g_ aya (from _g_ i, \'to\nconquer\').\n\n[145:1](sbe1224.htm#fr_359) Though the author does not state expressly that\nthis change of position in performing the five fore-offerings is advocated by\nsome other ritualists, he apparently argues in this passage against an\nactually adopted theory and practice, which the Sutras also mention as\noptional. In the case of the Adhvaryu changing his position, he is at each\nsuccessive fore-offering to pour the butter on a part of the fire east of the\npreceding one. Katy. III, 2, 18-21.\n\n[146:1](sbe1224.htm#fr_360) On the necessity of avoiding sameness of\nritualistic practices cf. note on I, 3, 2, 8. The five fore-offerings (praya\n_g_ a, here identified with the five seasons) are addressed respectively to\nthe kindling-sticks (samidh), to Tanunapat (or Nara _s_ a _m_ sa, both\nmystical forms of Agni), to the I _d_ s (personifications of the forms of\ndevotional feeling), to the sacrificial grass-covering of the altar (barhis),\nand to Agni and Soma (or other deities). Since, in introducing the first fore-\noffering, the Adhvaryu has mentioned its recipient, he is not to do so in the\ncase of the remaining four.\n\n[147:1](sbe1224.htm#fr_361) Such as lizards, alligators. Saya _n_ a.\n\n[148:1](sbe1224.htm#fr_362) See further on, par. 22. As to Svaha! marking the\nconclusion of the sacrifice, see the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us I, 9, 2, 25-28.\n\n[148:2](sbe1224.htm#fr_363) The first offering-prayer (to the logs) is \'ye ya\n_g_ amahe samidha _h_ , samidho agna a _g_ yasya vyantu vausha _t_!\' i.e. \'we\nwho pronounce the offering-prayer to the Samidhs,--the Samidhs, O Agni, may\naccept the butter! vausha _t_!\' Similarly at the other fore-offerings; but at\nthe second and fourth, where the object of worship is a single one (viz.\nTanunapat and the Barhis respectively), \'may he (or it) accept (vetu)!\' has to\nbe substituted for \'may they accept (vyantu)!\' The difference of number in\nthese verbal forms is symbolically explained as implying a distinction of sex,\nfor the reason that there may be more wives to one man, but only one husband\nto a woman. The elliptic expression ye ya _g_ amahe is thus explained by Saya\n_n_ a on Taitt. S. I, 6, 11: \'All we Hot _ri_ priests that are urged on by the\nAdhvaryu calling "Recite (thou)!" we do recite, we do pronounce p. 149 the ya\n_g_ ya.\' This introductory part of the offering-formula is called agur,\n\'acclamation, assent\' (\xc3\x82 _s_ v. I, 5, 4); it is alluded to in Mahabhar. Vanap.\nI2480 (cf. Muir, O. S. T. I, p. 135), and apparently by Pa _n_. VIII, 2, 88\n(cf. Haug, Ait. Br. II, p. 133 n.).\n\n[149:1](sbe1224.htm#fr_364) In making the oblation, the Adhvaryu holds the _g_\nuhu over the upabh _ri_ t and pours some of the butter from the _g_ uhu over\nthe spout of the upabh _ri_ t into the fire. At the third praya _g_ a he\nempties all the butter remaining in the _g_ uhu into the fire, and thereupon,\nfor the fourth oblation, replenishes the empty spoon with half the contents of\nthe upabh _ri_ t, after which he proceeds as before.\n\n[151:1](sbe1224.htm#fr_365) Cf. [p. 118](sbe1218.htm#page_118), note\n[3](sbe1218.htm#fn_309). The words \'Svaha Agnim\' &c. are preceded by \'ye ya\n_g_ amahe,\' see before, p. 148, note 2.\n\n[151:2](sbe1224.htm#fr_366) After the Adhvaryu has performed the last fore-\noffering, he p. 152 steps back behind the altar and sitting down beside the\ndishes of sacrificial food, anoints, with the butter remaining in the _g_ uhu,\nfirst the (butter in the) dhruva, then the several sacrificial dishes; and\nfinally the (butter in the) upabh _ri_ t. Katy. III, 3, 9.\n\n[152:1](sbe1224.htm#fr_367) What remains of the dish of sacrificial food,\nafter the oblation to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (I, 7, 3, 1 seq.) has been\nmade, is eaten by the priests and the sacrificer, and in their case the\nseveral portions are basted with butter, as they are cut off, but not the dish\nof food from which the portions have been taken.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 5, 4.
