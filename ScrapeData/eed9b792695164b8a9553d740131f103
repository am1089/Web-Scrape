The fire that has been kindled by means of the kindling verses,\nassuredly, blazes more brightly than any other fire; for, indeed, it is\nunassailable, unapproachable.\n\n1:4:3:22\\. And in like manner as the fire blazes when kindled by means of the\nkindling verses, so also blazes the priest (brahma _n_ a) that knows and\nrecites the kindling verses; for, indeed, he is unassailable, unapproachable.\n\n1:4:3:33\\. He recites, \'Pra va _h_  1;\' for the (word) pra _n_ a contains the\nsyllable pra (\'forwards;\' or, is directed forwards):. hence it is the pra _n_\na (out-breathing) which he kindles by this (the first samidheni). [He further\nrecites the second verse], \'Come hither, Agni, to expand!\' the backward\nbreathing (apana) 2, doubtless, is of this nature: the backward breathing he\naccordingly kindles with this (verse). Further (in the third verse), \'Shine\nforth, O youngest, brilliantly!\' the high-flaming one 3, indeed, is the upward\nbreathing (udana): the upward\n\np. 121\n\nbreathing he accordingly kindles with this (the third verse).\n\n1:4:3:44\\. Further, \'Sa na _h_ p _ri_ thu _s_ ravayyam 1,\' the \'far-hearing\none,\' indeed, is the ear, for it is with the ear that one hears here far or\nwidely: the ear he accordingly kindles with this (the fourth verse).\n\n1:4:3:55\\. Further, \'Praiseworthy he, adorable;\' the praiseworthy 2 one,\ndoubtless, is the voice; for it is the voice which praises everything here; by\nthe voice everything is praised here: he accordingly kindles the voice with\nthis (the fifth verse).\n\n1:4:3:66\\. Further, \'Yea, as a horse that bears (to) the gods;\' that which\nconveys to the gods is indeed the mind, for it is the mind which chiefly\nconveys the wise man (to the gods): the mind he accordingly kindles with this\n(the sixth verse).\n\n1:4:3:77\\. Further, \'O Agni, thee, that brightly shines!\' the eye, assuredly,\nshines: the eye he accordingly kindles by this (the seventh verse).\n\n1:4:3:88\\. Further, \'Agni we choose for messenger,\'--what central breath there\nis (in the body), that he kindles with this (the eighth verse): that one\nindeed is the internal motive force of the breathings; from it (two) others\ntend upwards, and from it (two) others tend downwards, for it is indeed the\ninternal motive force. And whosoever knows that internal motive force of the\nbreathings, him they regard as the internal motive force.\n\np. 122\n\n1:4:3:99\\. Further, \'The flaming-locked, him we adore!\' the flaming-locked,\ndoubtless, is the _s_ i _s_ na, for it is that organ which chiefly burns\n(torments) him who is endowed with it: the _s_ i _s_ na he accordingly kindles\nby this (the ninth verse).\n\n1:4:3:1010\\. Further, \'O Agni, worshipped, thou art lit! what downward\nbreathing there is that he kindles with this (the tenth verse); \'make\nofferings, do reverence!\' with this (the eleventh verse) he kindles the entire\nbody from the nails to the hair.\n\n1:4:3:1111\\. And if any one were to curse this one (the Hot _ri_ ) at the\n(recitation of the) first kindling verse, then he (the Hot _ri_ ) should say\nto him, \'Thereby thou hast put thine own out-breathing into the fire: by that\nout-breathing of thine shalt thou undergo suffering!\' for this is what would\ntake place.\n\n1:4:3:1212\\. If any one were to curse him at the second (verse), he should say\nto him, \'Thereby thou hast put thine own in-breathing into the fire: by that\nin-breathing of thine shalt thou undergo suffering!\' for this is what would\ntake place.\n\n1:4:3:1313\\. If any one were to curse him at the third (verse), he should say\nto him, \'Thereby thou hast put thine own up-breathing into the fire: by that\nup-breathing of thine shalt thou undergo suffering!\' for this is what would\ntake place.\n\n1:4:3:1414\\. If any one were to curse him at the fourth (verse), he should say\nto him, \'Thereby thou hast put thine own ear into the fire: by that ear of\nthine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt become deaf!\' for this is what\nwould take place.\n\n1:4:3:1515\\. If any one were to curse him at the fifth (verse), he should say\nto him, \'Thereby thou hast put thine own voice into the fire: by that voice of\n\np. 123\n\nthine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt become dumb!\' for this is what\nwould take place.\n\n1:4:3:1616\\. If any one were to curse him at the sixth (verse), he should say\nto him, \'Thereby thou hast put thine own mind into the fire: by that mind of\nthine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt move about as one possessed\nwith the (demon) "mind-stealer," as one deranged in mind!\' for this is what\nwould take place.\n\n1:4:3:1717\\. If any one were to curse him at the seventh (verse), he should\nsay to him, \'Thereby thou hast put thine own eye into the fire: by that eye of\nthine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt become blind!\' for this is what\nwould take place.\n\n1:4:3:1818\\. If any one were to curse him at the eighth (verse), he should say\nto him, \'Thereby thou hast put thine own central breath into the fire: by that\ncentral breath of thine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt expire and\ndie!\' for this is what would take place.\n\n1:4:3:1919\\. If any one were to curse him at the ninth (verse), he should say\nto him, \'Thereby thou hast put thine own organ into the fire: by that organ of\nthine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt become emasculate!\' for this is\nwhat would take place.\n\n1:4:3:2020\\. If any one were to curse him at the tenth (verse), he should say\nto him, \'Thereby thou hast put thine own down-breathing into the fire: by that\ndown-breathing of thine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt die from\nconstipation!\' for this is what would take place.\n\n1:4:3:2121\\. If any one were to curse him at the eleventh (verse), he should\nsay to him, \'Thereby thou hast\n\np. 124\n\nput thine entire body into the fire: with that entire body of thine shalt thou\nundergo suffering, thou shalt swiftly pass to yonder world!\' for this is what\nwould take place.\n\n1:4:3:2222\\. For in like manner as one undergoes suffering on approaching the\nfire that has been kindled by means of the kindling verses, so also does one\nundergo suffering for cursing a priest (brahma _n_ a) who knows and recites\nthe kindling verses.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[120:1](sbe1219.htm#fr_315) The first two words of the first samidheni, cf.\n[p. 101](sbe1217.htm#page_101) note. A mystic meaning is obtained for them by\nour author combining them and identifying the form obtained with the adjective\npravant, meaning both \'containing the syllable pra\' and \'directed forwards,\'\nboth of which meanings apply to the breathing-forth or expiration (pra _n_ a,\ncf. I, 1, 3, 2).\n\n[120:2](sbe1219.htm#fr_316) Bahir nirgatasya vayor atmabhimukhi v _ri_ ttir by\napana _h_ , udanavayur dehasyotkshepa _n_ ad adhikate _g_ oyukta _h_. Saya _n_\na.\n\n[120:3](sbe1219.htm#fr_317) The author apparently takes b _ri_ ha _k_ _kh_ o\n_k_ a( _h_ ) as a compound.\n\n[121:1](sbe1219.htm#fr_318) \'That (region) wide and glorious\' (do thou obtain\nfor us); but the author takes p _ri_ thu _s_ ravayyam as \'that widely hearing\none\' or \'the wide hearing.\' Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8, interprets it\nby \'that (holy work) which is extended and worthy of being heard by the gods.\'\n\n[121:2](sbe1219.htm#fr_319) He apparently takes idenya in an active sense.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 4.
