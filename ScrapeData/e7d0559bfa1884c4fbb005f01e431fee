Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1899], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 210\n\n### BOOK THE TWENTY-THIRD.\n\nIN the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, etc:  \n2 Taken upon a base art thou. I take thee welcome to Prajapati.  \nThis is thy place: Surya thy majesty.  \nThe majesty that has accrued to thee in the day, in a year,  \nthat majesty which has accrued in the wind, in the firmament,  \nto that majesty of thine, to Prajapati, to the Gods,  \nAll-hail!  \n3 Who, by his, grandeur hath become sole Ruler of all the.  \nmoving world that breathes and slumbers;  \nHe who is Sovran of these men and cattle\xc2\x97what God shall  \nwe adore with our oblation?  \n4 Taken upon a base art thou. I take thee welcome to Prajapati,  \nThis is thy place: the Moon thy majesty.  \nThy majesty that has accrued to thee by night, in a year,  \nthy majesty that has accrued in the earth, in Agni, in the  \nstars and in the Moon, to that majesty of thine, to Prajapati  \nand to the Gods, All-hail!  \n5 They who stand round hills as he moves harness the bright,  \nthe ruddy Steed:  \nThe lights are shining in the sky.  \n6 On both sides to the car they yoke the two. Bay Coursers  \ndear to him,  \nBold; tawny, bearers of the Chief.  \n7 When, swift as wind, the Horse has reached the form that  \nIndra loves, the flood,  \nAgain, O singer, by this path bring thou our Courser hitherward.\n\np. 211\n\n8 Let the Vasus anoint thee with Gayatri metre. Let the  \nRudras anoint thee with Trishtup metre. Let the \xc3\x82dityas  \nanoint thee with Jagati metre. Earth! Ether! Heaven!  \nO Gods, eat this food, parched grains and groats in the  \nproduct of barley and in the product of cows: eat this  \nfood, Prajapati.  \n9 Who moveth single and alone? Who is brought forth to life  \nagain?  \nWhat is the remedy of cold, or what the great receptacle?  \n10 The Sun moves single and alone. The Moon is brought to  \nlife again,  \nFire is the remedy of cold; Earth is the great receptacle.  \n11 What was the antecedent thought? What was the bird of  \nmighty size?  \nThe slippery matron, who was she? Who was the  \nreddish-coloured one?  \n12 Heaven was the antecedent thought. The Courser was the  \nmighty bird.  \nThe slippery matron was the earth, Night was the  \nreddish-coloured one.  \n13 Vayu help thee with cooked viands! Blackneck with goats;  \nNyagrodha with cups; Salmali with increase; this Stallion  \nhere, good for the chariot\xc2\x97let him verily come with  \nhis four feet. Brahmakrishna help us! Obeisance to Agni!\n\np. 212\n\n14 The car is fitted with the rein, the steed is fitted with the rein.  \nFitted in waters, water-born, is Brahma following Soma's lead.  \n15 Steed, from thy body, of thyself, sacrifice and accept thyself.  \nThy greatness can be gained by none but thee.  \n16 No, here thou diest not, thou art not injured: only by  \nfair paths to the Gods thou guest,  \nMay Savitar the God in that world place thee where dwell  \nthe pious, whether they have journeyed.  \n17 Agni was the victim. With him they sacrificed. He won this  \nworld in which Agni is. This shall become thy world.  \nThis shalt thou win. Drink these waters. Vayu was the  \nvictim. With him they sacrificed. He won this world  \nin which Vayu is. This shall become, etc., as above.  \nSurya was the victim, etc, He won the world in which  \nSurya is. This shall become, etc.  \n18 To vital breath, Hail! To out-breathing, Hail! To diffusive  \nbreath, Hail!  \nAmba! Ambika! Ambalika! No one is taking me away.  \nThe sorry horse will lie beside another, as Subhadra, the  \ndweller in Kampila.\n\np. 213\n\n19 Thee we invoke, troop-lord of troops, Thee we invoke, the  \nloved ones\xc2\x92 lord.  \nThee, lord of treasures, we invoke. My precious wealth!  \n.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .  \n.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .  \n32 Now have I glorified with praise strong Dadhikravan,  \nconquering steed,  \nSweet may he make our mouths: may he prolong the days  \nwe have to live.  \n33 Gayatri, Trishtup, Jagati, and Pankti with Anushtup joined,  \nBrihati, Kakup, Ushniha pacify thee with needle-points!  \n34 Two-footed, those that have four feet, those with three feet  \nand those with five,  \nMetteless, with one metre; these pacify thee with needle-points!  \n35 May Mahanamnis, Revatis, all far-spread Regions of the sky,  \nVoices, and lightnings from the cloud pacify thee with needle-points!  \n36 May married dames of human birth skilfully separate thy hair:  \nThe Regions, Consorts of the Gods, pacify thee with needle-points!\n\np. 214\n\n37 They, made of silver, gold, and lead, are used as helpers in  \nthe work.  \nAs lines on the strong Courser's skin may they console and  \ngive thee rest.  \n38 What then? As men whose fields are full of barley, etc., as  \nin X. 32.  \n39 Who flays thee? Who dissects thee? Who prepares thy limbs  \nfor sacrifice?  \nWho is the Sage that slaughters thee?  \n40 In due time let the seasons as thy Slaughterers divide thy  \njoints,  \nAnd with the splendour of the Year sacrifice thee with holy  \nrites.  \n41 Let the Half-months and let the Months, while sacrificing,  \nflay thy limbs:  \nLet Day and Night and Maruts mend each fault in sacrificing  \nthee.  \n42 Let the divine Adhvaryus flay thy body and dissect thy  \nframe,  \nAnd let the sacrificing lines prepare thy members joint by  \njoint,  \n43 May Sky, Earth, Air, and Wind supply each failing and  \ndefect of thine:  \nMay Surya with the Stars of heaven duly prepare a world  \nfor thee.  \n44 Well be it with thine upper parts, well be it with the parts  \nbelow!  \nWell he it with thy bones and with thy marrow and with all  \nthy frame!  \n45 Who moveth singly? etc., as in verse 9.  \n46 The Sun moves singly, etc., as in verse 10.  \n47 What lustre is like Surya's light? What lake is equal to the  \nSea?\n\np. 215\n\nWhat is more spacious than the Earth? What thing is that  \nwhich naught can mete?  \n48 Brahma is lustre like the Sea. Heaven is a flood to match  \nthe Sea.  \nIndra is vaster than the Earth. Beyond all measure is the  \nCow.  \n49 Friend of the Gods, I ask, for information, if thou in spirit  \nhast obtained the knowledge,  \nHath Vishnu this whole Universe pervaded in the three steps  \nwherein the God is worshipped?  \n50 I also am in those three steps of Vishnu wherewith this Universe  \nhe permeated.  \nThe earth and heaven I circle in a moment and this heaven's  \nsummit with a single organ.  \n51 What are the things which Purusha hath entered? What  \nthings hath Purusha contained within him?  \nThis riddle we propound to thee, O Brahman. Why dost  \nthou give no answer to my question?  \n52 Within five things hath Purusha found entrance; these  \nPurusha hath within himself connected.  \nThis is the thought which I return in answer. Thou art  \nnot my superior in wisdom.  \n53 What was the antecedent thought? etc., as in verse 11.  \n54 Heaven was the antecedent thought, etc., as in 12.  \n55 Who, tell me, is the yellowish she? Who is the darkly-  \nyellowish?  \nWho moves with rapid spring and bound? Who glides and  \nwinds along the path?\n\np. 216\n\n56 The she-goat, Sir, is yellowish, dark-yellowish is the porcupine.  \nThe hare moves swift with leap and bound: the snake creeps  \nwinding on the path.  \n57 How many different forms hath this, how many syllables,  \nburnt-oblations, brands for kindling?  \nHere, of the rites of sacrifice I ask thee. How many Hotars  \nin due season worship?  \n68 Sixfold its form, its syllables a hundred, eighty burnt-offerings,  \njust three brands for kindling.  \nTo thee I tell the rites of sacrificing. Seven Hotars worship  \nin appointed season.  \n59 Who knoweth this world's central point? Who knoweth the  \nheaven, the earth, and the wide air between them?  \nWho knows the birthplace of the mighty Surya? Who knows  \nthe Moon, whence he was generated?  \n60 I know the centre of the world about us. I know heaven,  \nearth, and the wide air between them.  \nI know the birthplace of the mighty Surya. I know the  \nMoon, whence he was generated.  \n61 I ask thee of the earth's extremest limit, where is the  \ncentre of the world, I ask thee.  \nI ask thee of the Stallion's genial humour, I ask of highest  \nheaven where Speech abideth.  \n62 This altar is the earth's extremest limit; this sacrifice of  \nours is the world's centre.  \nThis Soma is the Stallion's genial humour, this Brahman  \nhighest heaven where Speech abideth.\n\np. 217\n\n63 The Strong, the Self-existent One, the First, within the  \nmighty flood  \nLaid down the timely embryo from which Prajapati was born.  \n64 Let the Hotar sacrifice to Prajapati from the Mahiman-Soma.  \nLet him accept. Let him drink the Soma. Hotar, sacrifice.  \n65 Prajapati, thou only, etc., as in X. 20.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XXIV](wyvbk24.htm)\n\n"
