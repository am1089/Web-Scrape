Next comes the meditation as taught by _S_ akalya.\n\np. 249\n\n2\\. The first half is the earth, the second half heaven, their uniting the\nrain, the uniter Par _g_ anya 1.\n\n3\\. And so it is when he (Par _g_ anya) rains thus strongly, without ceasing,\nday and night 2,\n\n4\\. Then they say also (in ordinary language), 'Heaven and earth have come\ntogether.'\n\n5\\. So much with regard to the deities; now with regard to the body:--\n\n6\\. Every man is indeed like an egg 3. There are two halves 4 (of him), thus\nthey say: 'This half is the earth, that half heaven.' And there between them\nis the ether (the space of the mouth), like the ether between heaven and\nearth. In this ether there (in the mouth) the breath is fixed, as in that\nother ether the air is fixed. And as there are those three luminaries (in\nheaven), there are these three luminaries in man.\n\n7\\. As there is that sun in heaven, there is this eye in the head. As there is\nthat lightning in the sky, there is this heart in the body; as there is that\nfire on earth, there is this seed in the member.\n\n8\\. Having thus represented the self (body) as the whole world, _S_ akalya\nsaid: This half is the earth, that half heaven.\n\n9\\. He who thus knows this union, becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame,\nglory of countenance,\n\np. 250\n\nand the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.\n\n### THIRD KHA _N_ _D_ A 1.\n\n1\\. Next come the reciters of the Nirbhu _g_ a 2.\n\n2\\. Nirbhu _g_ a abides on earth, Prat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a in heaven, the\nUbhayamantare _n_ a in the sky.\n\n3\\. Now, if any one should chide him who recites the Nirbhu _g_ a, let him\nanswer: 'Thou art fallen from the two lower places 3.' If any one should chide\nhim who recites the Prat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a, let him answer: 'Thou art fallen from\nthe two higher places 4.' But he who recites the Ubhayamantare _n_ a, there is\nno chiding him.\n\n4\\. For when he turns out the Sandhi (the union of words), that is the form of\nNirbhu _g_ a 5; and when be pronounces two syllables pure (without\nmodification), that is the form of Prat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a 6. This comes\n\np. 251\n\nfirst 1. By the Ubhayamantara (what is between the two) both are fulfilled\n(both the sandhi and the pada).\n\n5\\. Let him who wishes for proper food say the Nirbhu _g_ a; let him who\nwishes for Svarga, say the Prat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a; let him who wishes for both\nsay the Ubhayamantare _n_ a.\n\n6\\. Now if another man (an enemy) should chide him who says the Nirbhu _g_ a,\nlet him say to him: 'Thou hast offended the earth, the deity; the earth, the\ndeity, will strike thee.'\n\nIf another man should chide him who says the Prat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a, let him say\nto him: 'Thou hast offended heaven, the deity; heaven, the deity, will strike\nthee.'\n\nIf another man should chide him who says the Ubhayamantare _n_ a, let him say\nto him: 'Thou hast offended the sky, the deity; the sky, the deity, will\nstrike thee.'\n\n7\\. And whatever the reciter shall say to one who speaks to him or does not\nspeak to him, depend upon it, it will come to pass.\n\n8\\. But to a Brahma _n_ a let him not say anything except what is auspicious.\n\n9\\. Only he may curse a Brahma _n_ a in excessive wealth 2.\n\n10\\. Nay, not even in excessive wealth should he curse a Brahma _n_ a, but he\nshould say, 'I bow before Brahma _n_ as,'--thus says _S_ uravira Ma _n_ _d_\nukeya.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[248:1](sbe01228.htm#fr_626) Both views are tenable, for it is not the actual\nair and ether which are meditated on, but their names, as declared and\nexplained in this peculiar act of worship. We should read aka _s_ a _s_ _k_\neti, a reading confirmed both by the commentary and by the Kashmir MS.\n\n[248:2](sbe01228.htm#fr_627) The man among heroes. Comm.\n\n[248:3](sbe01228.htm#fr_628) The Kashmir MS. reads manasaivagre.\n\n[248:4](sbe01228.htm#fr_629) Both views are admissible. Comm.\n\n[248:5](sbe01228.htm#fr_630) Pra _n_ asa _m_ hitah, Kashmir MS.\n\n[249:1](sbe01229.htm#fr_631) If i is followed by a, the i is changed to y, and\nboth are united as ya. Here a is the cause which changes i into y. Thus Par\n_g_ anya, the god of rain, is the cause which unites earth and heaven into\nrain. Comm.\n\n[249:2](sbe01229.htm#fr_632) When it rains incessantly, heaven and earth seem\nto be one in rain.\n\n[249:3](sbe01229.htm#fr_633) \xc3\x82ndam, a _n_ _d_ asad _ri_ _s_ am. Comm.\n\n[249:4](sbe01229.htm#fr_634) The one half from the feet to the lower jaw, the\nother half from the upper jaw to the skull. Comm.\n\n[250:1](sbe01229.htm#fr_635) Cf. Rig-veda-prati _s_ akhya, ed. Max Muller, p.\niii, and Nachtrage, p. ii.\n\n[250:2](sbe01229.htm#fr_636) Nirbhu _g_ a(n) is the recitation of the Veda\nwithout intervals, therefore the same as Sa _m_ hita. Prat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a is\nthe recitation of each word by itself (pada-pa _th_ a); Ubhayamantarena, the\nbetween the two, is the intertwining of Sa _m_ hita and Pada-pa _th_ a, the\nso-called Krama-pa _th_ a. By reciting the Sa _m_ hita inattentively, one may\nuse forms which belong to the Pada-text; and by reciting the Pada\ninattentively, one may use forms which belong to the Sa _m_ hita-text. But in\nreciting the Krama both the Sa _m_ hita and Pada forms are used together, and\ntherefore mistakes are less likely to happen.\n\n[250:3](sbe01229.htm#fr_637) From earth and sky. Cf. _Kh_. Up. II, 22, 3.\n\n[250:4](sbe01229.htm#fr_638) From the sky and from heaven.\n\n[250:5](sbe01229.htm#fr_639) Nirbhu _g_ a may mean without arms, as if the\narms of the words were taken away, or with two arms stretched out, the two\nwords forming, as it were, two arms to one body.\n\n[250:6](sbe01229.htm#fr_640) Prat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a means cut asunder, every word\nbeing separated from the others.\n\n[251:1](sbe01229.htm#fr_641) The words were first each separate, before they\nwere united according to the laws of Sandhi.\n\n[251:2](sbe01229.htm#fr_642) He may curse him, if he is exceeding rich; or he\nmay wish him the curse of excessive wealth; or he may curse him, if something\ngreat depends on it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 4](sbe01230.htm)\n\n"
