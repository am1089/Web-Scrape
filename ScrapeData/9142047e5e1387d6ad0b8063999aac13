On hearing these words,\nBulram Jee arose, and said to the cowherds\' children, his friends, "Brothers!\nlet us go and see the preparations at the place of amusement." At these words\nthey all accompanied him. Shree Krishnu and Bulram afterwards assumed the\nappearance of jugglers, and proceeding with their companions, the cowherds\'\nchildren, came to the gate of the place of amusement, and stood near where the\n" _must_ " elephant Koobliya, possessing the strength of ten thousand\nelephants, was moving to and fro. Beholding the elephant in a state of the\ngreatest excitement at the gate, Bulram called out to the keeper, "Mahout!\nlisten to what I say, and drive away the elephant from the gate. Let us have\naccess to the Raja; lest the elephant should be destroyed. I tell you\nbeforehand it will not be our fault, do not consider Huri a child. He is lord\nof the three worlds, and has descended upon the earth to destroy the wicked\nand\n\np. 154\n\nremove the burdens of the world." To this speech, the driver replied angrily,\n"I am aware that while tending herds, he has become lord of the three worlds,\nand for this reason has made his appearance here as a very great hero. Do not\nlook upon his breaking the bow as any thing: my elephant possesses the\nstrength of ten thousand. You shall not obtain entrance, until you fight with\nit. You have destroyed many powerful creatures; but if you escape to-day from\nthis elephant, I will acknowledge that you are very strong." Huldhur was\nenraged, and said, "Hear me! you foolish, low creature, be cautious what you\nsay, or I will presently dash you in pieces, and the elephant also; to\nhesitate is not advisable, as the elephant will be put to death immediately.\nBelieve what I am saying, and calling out to you." At these words the driver\nwas in a great passion, and drove the elephant towards them. As the elephant\ncharged Buldeo Jee, he struck it such a blow with his hand, that it folded up\nits trunk, and reeled back, screaming. When the strong men of Kuns, who were\nstanding near, beheld this wonderful act, they began to despair, and say to\nthemselves, "Who can possibly win against two such powerful antagonists?" And\nthe elephant driver, perceiving that the elephant had been forced back, was\nvery much alarmed, and began to reflect, "That unless these two children were\nkilled, Kuns would not allow him to escape with life." With these thoughts in\nhis mind, he goaded on the elephant again, with his iron goad, and made it\nenraged, and impelled it against the two brothers. When he laid hold of Huri\nwith his trunk, and, in his rage, endeavoured to crush him between his teeth,\nKrishnu assumed a very subtile body, and escaped between his teeth.\n\nAt this time all rose up through fear, gods, sages, men and women. Krishnu\nescaped between the elephant\'s two tusks, and the treasury of strength clapped\nhis hands. He rose up with the elephant, and then in sport drove him forward.\nAll became conscious of being restored to their lord, on beholding\n\np. 155\n\nthe exploits of Krishnu. On hearing the sound of Krishnu impelling Koobliya,\nmany more elephants rushed to the spot, enraged, and with trunks uplifted.\nMoorari remained crouched under Koobliya\'s belly, who thinking he had gone,\ncontinued looking after him. Huri then appearing behind the animal called out,\nand Buldeo circumvented it in front. They both began to make the elephant\nsport and gambol; and all were frightened at seeing this. O great king!\nsometimes Bulram laid hold of its trunk, and Krishnu of its tail; and when the\nelephant ran to lay hold of them, they slipped away.\n\nThey remained sporting with it for some time in the same way that they used to\nplay with calves in their infancy. At length Huri seizing it by the tail, and\nwhirling it round, dashed it on the ground, and killed it with blows. He\npulled out the elephant\'s tusks, and blood streamed like a river from its\nmouth.\n\nOn the death of the elephant, the driver came bawling out to Krishnu, who\ninstantly destroyed him, and threw him under the feet of the elephant. And the\ntwo brothers laughing and disguised as jugglers, each with an elephant\'s tusk\nin his hand, went and stood in the centre of the place, which had been\nprepared for amusement (the theatre.) Whoever beheld Nund Lal at this time, he\nappeared to him in the same form as the beholder; wrestlers thought him a\nwrestler; Rajas a Raja; the gods as their lord; the cowherds\' children, as a\ncompanion; Nund and Oopnund as their child; the women of the city regarded him\nas the abode of beauty; Kuns and all evil spirits looked upon him in the light\nof death.\n\nO great king! whilst looking at Krishnu and Buldeo, Kuns being very much\nafraid called out to the wrestlers, "To knock them down and destroy them; or\ndrive them away from his presence." When Kuns had thus spoken, the wrestlers,\naccompanied by their instructors, their sons and pupils, and adopting various\ndifferent appearances, striking their arms in preparation for battle,\ncollected together on all sides to attack Krishnu\n\np. 156\n\nand Bulram, who remained firm, as they advanced. Chanoor, one of the\nwrestlers, looking towards them, said with sly impertinence of manner, "Our\nRaja is a little out of spirits to-day, and wishes to see you fight by way of\namusing his mind; because during your abode in the jungle, you have learnt all\nthe science of fighting. Be not at all anxious in your minds, but come and\nwrestle with us, and give pleasure to our Raja." Shree Krishnu replied, "The\nRaja Jee has acted with great kindness in having invited us to-day; what shall\nwe be able to do for him? You are very powerful, and possessed of skill; and\nwe are ignorant children; how shall we be able to encounter you? It is said,\nthat we ought to marry, and have friendship and enmity with equals; but we\nhave no power over the Raja Jee; and therefore consent to what you propose;\nsave us and do not exert your strength to dash us to pieces. It is proper that\nboth parties should act with due regard to justice, and unite in endeavouring\nto please the Raja"\n\nOn hearing these words, Chanoor was alarmed and said, "It is impossible to\nunderstand your nature and condition. You are not two children, but powerful\nmen in disguise. Whilst playing with the bow you broke it into two pieces; the\nelephant Koobliya was immediately killed and obtained deliverance. You never\nsustain defeat in fighting, every one knows these circumstances."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XLV](psa46.htm)\n\n'
