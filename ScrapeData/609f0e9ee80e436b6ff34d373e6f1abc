Vyasa said :--  O King! That King Mandhata, true to his promise,\nconquered one after another the whole world and became the paramount sovereign\nof all the other emperors and got the title \xc2\x93Sarvabhauma\xc2\x94 (Sovereign of all\nthe earth). O King! What more to speak of Mandhata's influence at that time\nthan this that all the robbers, struck with his terror, all fled to the\nmountain caves. For this reason, Indra gave him the title \xc2\x93Trasadasyu.\xc2\x94 He\nmarried Bindumati, the daughter of S'as'avindu. Her limbs were proportioned\nand perfect and so she was very beautiful. Mandhata had by that wife two sons\n:-- (1) the famous Purukutstha and (2) Muchukunda. Purukutstha had his son\nAnara _n_ ya; this prince was celebrated by the name of Brihadas'va. He was\nvery religious and deeply devoted to his father. His son was Haryas'va; he was\nreligious and knew the Highest Reality. His son was Tridhanva; his son was Aru\n_n_ a. Aru _n_ a's son was Satyavrata; he was very avaricious, lustful, wicked\nand wilful. Once on an occasion that vicious prince, overpowered by lust,\nstole away the wife of one Brahmi _n_ and so created an hindrance in his\nmarriage. O King! The Brahmi _n_ s, united in a body, came to the King Aru _n_\na, bewailing and lamenting and uttered repeatedly :-- Alas! We are ruined! The\nKing addressed to the grieved subjects, the Brahmi _n_ s :-- \xc2\x93O Brahmi _n_ s!\nWhat harm has been done to you by my son.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHearing thus the good words of the King, the Dvijas, versed in the Vedas,\nrepeatedly blessed him and said :--\n\n\n\np. 627\n\n\n\nO King! You are the foremost of the powerful. So your son is like you. Today\nhe has forcibly stolen away during the marriage ceremony a Brahmi _n_ daughter\nalready given over in marriage.\n\n\n\n12-36. Vyasa said :-- O King! The highly religious King hearing the words of\nthe Brahmi _n_ s, took them to be true and said to his son :-- \xc2\x93O One of evil\nunderstanding! You have rendered to-day your name useless by perpetrating this\nevil act. O Vicious One! Get away from my house! O Sinner! You will never be\nable to live in my territory!\xc2\x94 Seeing his father angry, Satyavrata repeatedly\nsaid :-- Father! Where shall I go?  He said :-- \xc2\x93Live with the Cha _nd_ alas.\nYou have stolen a Brahmi _n_ 's wife and so has acted like a Cha _nd_ ala. Go\nand live with them happily. O Disgrace to your family! I don't like to get\nissues through you: you have obliterated this family's name. So, O Sinner! go\nwherever you like.\xc2\x94 Hearing the the words from his angry father, Satyavrata\ninstantly quitted the house and went to the Cha _nd_ alas. The prince, wearing\nhis coat of armour and holding bows and arrows, began to spend away his time\nwith the Cha _nd_ alas; but he could not get out of his breast his feeling of\nsympathy and mercy. When he was banished by his liberal minded angry father\nthe Guru Vas'i _st_ ha instigated the King to the above purpose. Satyavrata\nwas therefore angry with Vas'i _st_ ha, inasmuch as he, versed the Dharma\nS'astras, did not dissuade the father from banishing his son. His father,\nthen, owing to some inexplicable cause, quitted the city and, for the sake of\nhis son, went to the forest to practise austerities. O King! Owing to that\nsinful act, Indra did not rain at all in his kingdom for twelve years. O King!\nJust then Vis'vamitra, too, keeping his wife and children in that kingdom,\nbegan to practise severe austerities on the banks of the river Kaus'iki. The\nbeautiful wife of Kus'ika then fell into great trouble how she could maintain\nthe family. All the children, pained with hunger, began to cry, begging for\nNibar rice food. The chaste wife of Kaus'ika became very much troubled seeing\nall this. She thought, seeing the children hungry, \xc2\x93Where am I to go now and\nfrom whom to beg, and what to do, inasmuch as the King was not then staying in\nthe Kingdom. The husband is not also near; so who would protect my children?\nThe boys are incessantly crying. Fie therefore to my life!\xc2\x94 She thought also\nthus :-- \xc2\x93My husband left me in this penniless state; we are suffering for\nwant of money. He does not know these, though he is quite able. Save my\nhusband, who else will support my sons? They will all die now of starvation. I\nmight sell one of my sons, whatever I get out of that, I can support the\nothers; this is now my highest duty. I ought not to do otherwise\n\n\n\np. 628\n\n\n\nand kill all my children; so I will now sell one of my sons to support the\nothers.\xc2\x94 Thus hardening her mind, she went out, tying the child by a rope\nround his neck. The Muni's wife, for the sake of the other children, fastened\nthe middle son by a cord and got out of her house. The prince Satyavrata saw\nher distressed with pain and sorrow and asked :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful One! What are\nyou now going to do? Who are you? This boy is crying; Why have you tied him by\na rope round his neck? O Fair One! Speak out truly to me the cause of all\nthis.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n37-38. The wife said :-- \xc2\x93O Prince! I am the wife of Vis'vamitra. These are my\nsons. I am now going, for want of food, to sell one of these out of my own\naccord. O King! My husband has gone away to practise tapasya; I do not know\nwhere he has gone. There is no food in the house; so I will sell one to\nsupport the other sons.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39-56. Satyavrata said :-- \xc2\x93O Chaste One! Save your children. I will bring to\nyou your articles of food from the forest till your husband does not come\nhere. Daily I will fasten some food on a tree close by your \xc3\x82s'rama. This I\nspeak truly.\xc2\x94 The wife of Vis'vamitra, hearing these words of the prince,\nfreed the child of the fastening and took him to her \xc3\x82s'rama. The child was\nnamed afterwards as Galaba, due to his being fastened by the neck. He became a\ngreat Ri _s_ i afterwards. The Vis'vamitra's wife then felt great pleasure in\nher home, surrounded by her children. Filled with regard, and mercy,\nSatyavrata duly performed his task and provided daily the family of\nVis'vamitra with their food. He used to hunt wild boars, deer, buffaloes,\netc., and used to take their flesh to the place where used to dwell the wife\nof Vis'vamitra and the children and tie that up to an adjoining tree. The Ri\n_s_ i's wife used to give those to her children. Thus getting excellent food,\nshe felt very happy. Now when the King Aru _n_ a went for tapasya to the\nforest, the Muni Vas'i _st_ ha carefully guarded the Ayodhya city, and the\npalace and the household. Satyavrata, too, used to sustain his livelihood\ndaily by hunting, accordig to his father's order; and abiding by Dharma, lived\nin the forest outside the city. Satyavrata cherished always in his heart, for\nsome cause, a feeling of anger towards Vas'i _st_ ha. When his father banished\nhis religious son, Vas'i _st_ ha did not prevent his father. This is the cause\nof Satyavrata's anger. Marriage does not become valid until seven footsteps\nare trodden (a ceremony); so the stealing away of a girl within that period is\nnot equivalent to stealing away a Brahmi _n_ 's wife. The virtuous Vas'i _st_\nha knew that; yet he did not prevent the King. One day the prince did not find\nanything for hunting; he saw in the\n\n\n\np. 629\n\n\n\nforest the cow of Vas'i _st_ ha giving milk. Very much distressed by hunger,\nthe King killed the cow like a dacoit, partly out of anger and partly out of\ndelusion. He fastened part of the flesh to that tree for the wife of\nVis'vamitra and the remainder he ate himself. O One of good vows! The\nVis'vamitra's wife did not know that to be beef and thought it to be deer's\nand so fed her sons with that. Now when Vas'i _st_ ha came to know that his\ncow had been killed, he was inflamed with anger and spoke to Satyavrata \xc2\x93O\nVicious One! What a heinous crime have you committed, like a Pis'acha, by\nkilling the cow? For the killing of the cow, the stealing of a Brahmi _n_ 's\nwife and the fiery anger of your father, for these three crimes, let there\ncome out on your head three S'ankus or three marks of leprosy as the signs for\nyour crimes. From this day you will be widely known by the name of Tris'anku\nand you will show your Pis'acha form to all the beings.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n57\\. Vyasa said : -- O King! The prince Satyavrata thus cursed by Vais'i _st_\nha remained in that retreat and practised severe tapasya.\n\n\n\n58\\. But he got from a Muni's son the excellent Mantram of the Highest\nauspicious Devi Bhagavati and became merged in the contemplation of that.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Tenth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the story of Satyavrata in\nthe Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk07ch11.htm)\n\n"
