In considering\nthese spiritual powers, two things must be understood and kept in memory. The\nfirst of these is this: These spiritual powers can only be gained when the\ndevelopment described in the first and second books has been measurably\nattained; when the Commandments have been kept, the Rules faithfully followed,\nand the experiences which are described have been passed through. For only\nafter this is the spiritual man so far grown, so far disentangled from the\npsychical bandages and veils which have confined and blinded him, that he can\nuse his proper powers and faculties. For this is the secret of all spiritual\npowers: they are in no sense an abnormal or supernatural overgrowth upon the\nmaterial man, but are rather the powers and faculties inherent in the\nspiritual man, entirely natural to him, and coming naturally into activity, as\nthe spiritual man is disentangled and liberated from psychical bondage,\nthrough keeping the Commandments and Rules already set forth.\n\nAs the personal man is the limitation and inversion of the spiritual man, all\nhis faculties and powers are inversions of the powers of the spiritual man. In\na single phrase, his self seeking is the inversion of the Self-seeking which\nis the very being of the spiritual man: the ceaseless search after the divine\nand august Self of all beings. This inversion is corrected by keeping the\nCommandments and Rules, and gradually, as the inversion is overcome, the\nspiritual man is extricated, and comes into possession and free exercise of\nhis powers. The spiritual powers, therefore, are the powers of the grown and\nliberated spiritual man. They can only be developed and used as the spiritual\nman grows and attains liberation through obedience. This is the first thing to\nbe kept in mind, in all that is said of spiritual powers in the third and\nfourth books of the Sutras. The second thing to be understood and kept in mind\nis this:\n\nJust as our modern sages have discerned and taught that all matter is\nultimately one and eternal, definitely related throughout the whole wide\nuniverse; just as they have discerned and taught that all force is one and\neternal, so coordinated throughout the whole universe that whatever affects\nany atom measurably affects the whole boundless realm of matter and force, to\nthe most distant star or nebula on the dim confines of space; so the ancient\nsages had discerned and taught that all consciousness is one, immortal,\nindivisible, infinite; so finely correlated and continuous that whatever is\nperceived by any consciousness is, whether actually or potentially, within the\nreach of all consciousness, and therefore within the reach of any\nconsciousness. This has been well expressed by saying that all souls are\nfundamentally one with the Oversoul; that the Son of God, and all Sons of God,\nare fundamentally one with the Father. When the consciousness is cleared of\npsychic bonds and veils, when the spiritual man is able to stand, to see, then\nthis superb law comes into effect: whatever is within the knowledge of any\nconsciousness, and this includes the whole infinite universe, is within his\nreach, and may, if he wills, be made a part of his consciousness. This he may\nattain through his fundamental unity with the Oversoul, by raising himself\ntoward the consciousness above him, and drawing on its resources. The Son, if\nhe would work miracles, whether of perception or of action, must come often\ninto the presence of the Father. This is the birthright of the spiritual man;\nthrough it he comes into possession of his splendid and immortal powers. Let\nit be clearly kept in mind that what is here to be related of the spiritual\nman, and his exalted powers, must in no wise be detached from what has gone\nbefore. The being, the very inception, of the spiritual man depends on the\npurification and moral attainment already detailed, and can in no wise\ndispense with these or curtail them.\n\nLet no one imagine that the true life, the true powers of the spiritual man,\ncan be attained by any way except the hard way of sacrifice, of trial, of\nrenunciation, of selfless self-conquest and genuine devotion to the weal of\nall others. Only thus can the golden gates be reached and entered. Only thus\ncan we attain to that pure world wherein the spiritual man lives, and moves,\nand has his being. Nothing impure, nothing unholy can ever cross that\nthreshold, least of all impure motives or self seeking desires. These must be\nburnt away before an entrance to that world can be gained.\n\nBut where there is light, there is shadow; and the lofty light of the soul\ncasts upon the clouds of the mid-world the shadow of the spiritual man and of\nhis powers; the bastard vesture and the bastard powers of psychism are easily\nattained; yet, even when attained, they are a delusion, the very essence of\nunreality.\n\nTherefore ponder well the earlier rules, and lay a firm foundation of courage,\nsacrifice, selflessness, holiness.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book III](ysp06.htm)\n\n'
