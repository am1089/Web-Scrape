Pra _n_ a (breath) is Brahman, that being understood from a connected\nconsideration (of the passages referring to pra _n_ a).\n\nIn the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a-upanishad there is recorded a legend of Indra\nand Pratardana which begins with the words, 'Pratardana, forsooth, the son of\nDivodasa came by means of fighting and strength to the beloved abode of Indra'\n(Kau. Up. III, 1). In this legend we read: 'He said: I am pra _n_ a, the\nintelligent Self (pra _g \xc3\xb1_atman), meditate on me as Life, as Immortality'\n(III, 2). And later on (III, 3), 'Pra _n_ a alone, the intelligent Self,\nhaving laid hold of this body, makes it rise up.' Then, again (III, 8), 'Let\nno man try to find out what speech is, let him know the speaker.' And in the\nend (III, 8), 'That breath indeed is the intelligent Self, bliss,\nimperishable, immortal.'--Here the doubt presents itself whether the word pra\n_n_ a denotes merely breath, the modification of air, or the Self of some\ndivinity, or the individual soul, or the highest Brahman.--But, it will be\nsaid at the outset, the Sutra I, 1, 21 already has shown that the word pra _n_\na refers to Brahman, and as here also we meet with characteristic marks of\nBrahman, viz. the words 'bliss, imperishable, immortal,' what reason is there\nfor again raising the same doubt?--We reply: Because there are observed here\ncharacteristic marks of different kinds. For in the legend we meet not only\nwith marks indicating Brahman, but also with marks pointing to other beings\nThus Indra's words, 'Know me only' (III, 1) point to the Self of a divinity;\nthe words, 'Having laid hold of this body it makes it rise up,' point to the\nbreath; the words, 'Let no man try to find out what speech is, let him know\n\np. 98\n\nthe speaker,' point to the individual soul. There is thus room for doubt.\n\nIf, now, the purvapakshin maintains that the term pra _n_ a here denotes the\nwell-known modification of air, i.e. breath, we, on our side, assert that the\nword pra _n_ a must be understood to denote Brahman.--For what reason?--On\naccount of such being the consecutive meaning of the passages. For if we\nexamine the connexion of the entire section which treats of the pra _n_ a, we\nobserve that all the single passages can be construed into a whole only if\nthey are viewed as referring to Brahman. At the beginning of the legend\nPratardana, having been allowed by Indra to choose a boon, mentions the\nhighest good of man, which he selects for his boon, in the following words,\n'Do you yourself choose that boon for me which you deem most beneficial for a\nman.' Now, as later on pra _n_ a is declared to be what is most beneficial for\nman, what should pra _n_ a denote but the highest Self? For apart from the\ncognition of that Self a man cannot possibly attain what is most beneficial\nfor him, as many scriptural passages declare. Compare, for instance, _S_ ve.\nUp. III, 8, 'A man who knows him passes over death; there is no other path to\ngo.' Again, the further passage, 'He who knows me thus by no deed of his is\nhis life harmed, not by theft, not by bhru _n_ ahatya' (III, 1), has a meaning\nonly if Brahman is supposed to be the object of knowledge. For, that\nsubsequently to the cognition of Brahman all works and their effects entirely\ncease, is well known from scriptural passages, such as the following, 'All\nworks perish when he has been beheld who is the higher and the lower' (Mu. Up.\nII, 2, 8). Moreover, pra _n_ a can be identified with the intelligent Self\nonly if it is Brahman. For the air which is non-intelligent can clearly not be\nthe intelligent Self. Those characteristic marks, again, which are mentioned\nin the concluding passage (viz. those intimated by the words 'bliss,'\n'imperishable,' 'immortal') can, if taken in their full sense, not be\nreconciled with any being except Brahman. There are, moreover, the following\npassages, 'He does not increase by a good action, nor decrease by a bad\naction. For he makes him whom he wishes\n\np. 99\n\nto lead up from these worlds do a good deed; and the same makes him whom he\nwishes to lead down from these worlds do a bad deed;' and, 'He is the guardian\nof the world, he is the king of the world, he is the Lord of the world' (Kau.\nUp. III, 8). All this can be properly understood only if the highest Brahman\nis acknowledged to be the subject-matter of the whole chapter, not if the\nvital air is substituted in its place. Hence the word pra _n_ a denotes\nBrahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 29](sbe34035.htm)\n\n"
