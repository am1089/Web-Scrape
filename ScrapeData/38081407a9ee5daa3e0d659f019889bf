Shining Agni has awoke over against the Dawns, the priest who traces the\nfootsteps of the sages [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:1:1). With his broad stream of\nlight kindled by the pious, the carrier (of the gods) has opened the two doors\nof darkness.\n\n2\\. Agni has grown strong by praises, by the speeches of the praisers, by\nhymns, the adorable one. Loving many aspects of _Ri_ ta the messenger has\nshone up at the bursting forth of the Dawn.\n\n3\\. Agni has been established among the tribes of men, the son of the waters,\nMitra [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:3:1), acting in the right way. The delightful,\nworshipful one has reached the top; the priest has become one who should be\ninvoked by prayers.\n\n4\\. Agni becomes Mitra [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:4:1), when he has been kindled;\nhe the Hot _ri_ (Agni becomes) Mitra; he, _G_ atavedas, (becomes) Varu _n_ a.\nThe quick Adhvaryu, the domestic (god, Agni, becomes) Mitra, the Mitra (i. e.\nfriend or ally) of the rivers and of the mountains.\n\n5\\. He observes the deceiver's dear summit [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:1), the\nfootstep of the bird [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:1); the vigorous one\n[2](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:2) observes the course of the Sun. Agni observes at\nhis (?) navel the seven-headed (song?) [3](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:3); tall\n(Agni) observes the enjoyment of the gods.\n\n6\\. The _Ri_ bhu [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:6:1) has created for himself a good\nname worthy of being magnified, he, the god who knows all laws. The skin of\nthe herbs [2](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:6:2), the bird's footstep\n[3](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:6:3) rich in ghee: Agni watches (all) that, never\nfailing.\n\np. 241\n\n7\\. Agni has approached the place [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:7:1) rich in ghee\n(the altar), with broad passages, (the place) longing (for him), longing\n(himself). He the resplendent, bright, tall purifier has made his two parents\n[2](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:7:2) new again and again.\n\n8\\. As soon as born he has grown by the grass [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:8:1),\nwhen the sprouting (grass-)blades strengthen him with ghee. Like waters\nbeautiful on their precipitous path, Agni, being in the lap of his parents,\nhas escaped into wide space.\n\n9\\. Receiving praise the vigorous one [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:9:1) has shone\nforth with his fuel, on heaven's summit, on the earth's navel. May Agni worthy\nof being magnified, (being) Mitra and Matari _s_ van, the messenger, carry\nhither the gods that they may receive our sacrifice.\n\n10\\. The tall one has, by (receiving) fuel, upheld the firmament, Agni,\nbecoming the highest of lights, when Matari _s_ van for the sake of the Bh\n_ri_ gus [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:10:1) kindled the carrier of oblations,\n(Agni) who dwelt in secret.\n\n11 = III, 1, 23.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--No verse occurs in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. On pada-vi\xc2\xb4, comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 299.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Mitra has here and in verse 4 two meanings: it is the name of the god\nMitra, with whom Agni is identified (Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, III, 134\nseq.), and it means also 'friend' or 'ally' (comp. H. O., Religion des Veda,\n186, note 1). See von Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p. 13.\n\np. 242\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. See verse 3, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. All this is very enigmatical. In the parallel passage, IV, 5, 8, we\nhave, instead of ripa _h_ agram, the reading rupa _h_ agram, which is\nconfirmed by verse 7 of the same hymn (agre rupa _h_ ) and by X, 13, 3 (pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ a pada\xc2\xb4ni rupa _h_ anu aroham); in support of the reading ripa _h_ , on\nthe other side, the verse, X, 79, 3 (ripa _h_ upasthe anta _h_ ), may be\nquoted. The meaning of rup is unknown; rip means 'deceit' and 'deceiver:' but\nwhat is the summit of the deceiver? Bergaigne (Religion Vedique, II, 77 seq.)\nhas tried to solve the riddle, but it is really hopeless.--The meaning of the\nfollowing words, pada _m_ ve _h_ , is not quite so obscure; there is at least\nsome probability that the bird is Agni himself (cf. below, III, 7, 7), or\npossibly the sun. The latter explanation is advocated by Prof. Max Muller, who\nwrites: 'May it not be a description of sunrise? priyam ripa _h_ agram I do\nnot understand; but padam ve _h_ is the place of the bird, as in I, 130, 3. ve\n_h_ na garbham, the nest of the bird or of the sun. This nest is covered by a\nstone, is in fact the vra _g_ a, which has to be opened to let out the light\nof day. It is also the yoni or the altar. Ripa _h_ agram may possibly be the\nsummit of the Pa _n_ i or of V _ri_ tra, X, 79, 3.'\n\nNote 2. See above, I, 36, 1, note 2.\n\nNote 3. Sapta- _s_ irshan ('seven-headed') occurs again in two other passages\nof the Rig-veda (VIII, 51, 4, and X, 67, 1); in both it is an epithet of words\nwhich signify 'hymn' or 'prayer' (arka, dhi\xc2\xb4). Possibly a similar word should\nbe supplied here. But why are the prayers called 'seven-headed?' Does this\nrefer to unknown technicalities of the Vedic liturgy? Does it stand in\nconnection with the seven tones of the scale, with the expression sapta\ndhitaya _h_ , with the number of the seven Hot _ri_ s? 'Celui qui a sept tetes\nest sans doute un personnage equivalent a lui seul au\n\np. 243\n\ngroupe des sept pretres,' says Bergaigne (II, 145), which is very ingenious,\nbut should not be given as a doubtless fact.--Prof. Max Muller observes that\nsapta _s_ irshan may be, like saptasya, the vra _g_ a of Pa _n_ i, opened by\nAgni, IV, 51, 4, and that B _ri_ haspati is called saptasya, IV, 50, 4, and\nsaptagu, X, 47, 6.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Agni is here called _Ri_ bhu in his quality as a skilful artisan. See\nBergaigne, Religion Vedique, II, 408.\n\nNote 2. There seems to be no doubt that sasa (comp. sasya) means 'herb' or\npossibly 'grain' in X, 79, 3; the text there has sasam na pakvam; comp. I, 66,\n2. yava _h_ na pakva _h_. The same meaning is quite admissible in I, 51, 3; V,\n21, 4; VIII, 72, 3; though these passages are too uncertain for deciding\nanything. I cannot find any reason for believing that we have here and in IV,\n5, 7; 7, 7 (see below), another word derived from the root sas, and meaning\n'the sleeper.' At all events I neither pretend to know what mysteries are\nhidden under the 'skin of the herbs,' nor what stories may have happened to\nthe 'peau du dormeur' (Bergaigne, II, 78 seq.).\n\nNote 3. See verse 5, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Yonim, literally 'womb.'\n\nNote 2. Probably Heaven and Earth.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Prof. Max Muller refers this to the grass of the barhis, or the tender\nblades in which the spark is caught and kept alive by ghee.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, I, 36, 1, note 2.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. I have adopted, though I do not believe it certain, Grassmann's\nopinion on the meaning of pari in this connection. Comp. H. O., Religion des\nVeda, 123, note 4.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 6](sbe46066.htm)\n\n"
