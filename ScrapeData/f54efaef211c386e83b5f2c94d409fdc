Charm for conducting a river into a new channel.\n\n1\\. Because of yore, when the (cloud-) serpent was slain (by Indra), ye did\nrush forth and shout (anadata), therefore is your name 'shouters' (nadyah\nrivers'): that is your designation, ye streams!  \n2\\. Because, when sent forth by Varuna, ye then quickly did bubble up; then\nIndra met (apnot) you, as ye went, therefore anon are ye 'meeters' (apah\nwaters')!  \n3\\. When reluctantly ye flowed, Indra, forsooth, did with might choose\n(avivarata) you as his own, ye goddesses! Therefore 'choice' (var 'water') has\nbeen given you as your name!  \n4\\. One god stood upon you, as ye flowed according to will. Up breathed (ud\nanishuh) they who are known as 'the great' (mahih). Therefore 'upbreather'\n(udakam 'water') are they called!  \n5\\. The waters are kindly, the waters in truth were ghee. These waters, truly,\ndo support Agni and Soma. May the readily flowing, strong sap of the honey-\ndripping (waters) come to me, together with life's breath and lustre!  \n6\\. Then do I see them and also do I hear them; their sound, their voice doth\ncome to me. When, ye golden-coloured, I have refreshed myself with you, then I\nween, ambrosia (amrita) am I tasting!  \n7\\. Here, ye waters, is your heart, here is your calf, ye righteous ones! Come\nye, mighty ones, by this way here, by which I am conducting you here!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 106. Charm to ward off danger from fire](av175.htm)\n\n"
