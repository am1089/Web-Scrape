She saw\nRituparna stepping down, and Varshneya, who followed him, while Vahuka began\nto unyoke the foaming steeds.\n\nKing Bhima, who knew naught of his daughter\'s stratagem, received the royal\nRajah of Ayodhya with much courtesy, and said: "I bid thee welcome, O king. .\n. . Why hast thou come hither?"\n\nNow Rituparna wondered greatly that he beheld no kings or kings\' sons, or even\nsigns that a swayamvara was about to be held, but he kept his counsel and\nsaid: "I have come to salute thee, O Bhima."\n\nThe royal sire of Damayanti smiled thereat and said unto himself: "He hath not\ncome so speedily through many cities for such a purpose. But we shall know\nbetimes why he hath made this journey."\n\nRituparna was conducted to his chamber for rest and\n\np. 365\n\nrefreshment by a company of royal servants, and Varshneya went with them.\n\nMeanwhile Vahuka led his horses to the stables, and Damayanti descended to her\nchamber, thinking again and again that the sound of the coming chariot was\nlike to the sound of Nala drawing nigh. So she called her fair handmaid, who\nwas named Ke\xc5\x9bini, and said unto her: "Go forth and speak to the misshapen\ncharioteer with short arms, for methinks he is Nala. . . . Ask thou him who he\nis, and be mindful of his answer."\n\nThe handmaiden went forth and spoke unto Vahuka, saying: "Lo! the Princess\nDamayanti would fain know whence ye come and for what purpose."\n\nSaid Vahuka: "King Rituparna hath heard that the swayamvara is to be held at\ndawn to-morrow, so he set forth from Ayodhya and came hither swifter than the\nwind. I am his charioteer."\n\nKe\xc5\x9bini asked him: "Who is the third man who hath come?"\n\nSaid Vahuka: "Varshneya is his name. He departed unto Ayodhya when Nala fled\naway. . . . I am skilled in taming steeds and in preparing viands."\n\nThe handmaiden then asked: "And doth this Varshneya know whither Nala hath\nfled and how he fares. Hath he told thee aught regarding him?"\n\nSaid Vahuka: "Varshneya carried away the children of Nala from Nishadha, but\nhe knows not aught of the rajah, O fair one. Indeed, no man knoweth. He hath\nassumed a strange form, and wanders disguised about the world. . . . Nala\nalone knoweth, nor will he reveal himself."\n\nKe\xc5\x9bini then spake, saying: "When the holy Brahman went unto the city of\nAyodhya he uttered those words of Damayanti once and once again:\n\np. 366\n\n\' _Whither art thou gone, O gambler, who didst sever my garment in twain? Thou\ndidst leave thy loved one as she lay slumbering in the savage wood. Lo! she is\nawaiting thy return. By day and by night she sitteth alone, consumed by her\ngrief. Oh! hear her prayer and have compassion, thou noble hero, because that\nshe ever weepeth for thee in the depths of her despair_.\'\n\nNow speak again, I pray thee, the words which thou didst utter to the Brahman,\nfor they gave healing to the stricken heart of Damayanti. Fain would the\nprincess hear that speech once more."\n\nThen was the soul of Nala rent with grief, hearing the message of Damayanti,\nand with tearful voice he said, repeating his former utterance:\n\n" _In the excess of her sorrow a noble woman will compose herself and remain\nconstant, and so win heaven by her virtues. She is protected by the\nbreastplate of her chastity, and will suffer no harm. Nor will she yield to\nanger, although she be deserted by her lord, whose robe the birds have taken\naway, leaving him in sore distress. She will not be moved to wrath against her\nhusband, the sorrow-stricken and famine-wasted, who hath been bereft of his\nkingdom and despoiled of happiness_."\n\nNala could scarce restrain his emotion as he spoke these words. Then the fair\nKe\xc5\x9bini hastened unto Damayanti and told all.\n\nIn her distress the princess said unto her handmaiden: "Go thou and observe\nthis man closely, and return betimes to inform me of all he doeth. When he\ndoth prepare viands for his royal master let no fire be given unto him nor any\nwater."\n\nKe\xc5\x9bini hastened forth to watch the charioteer, and\n\np. 367\n\nwhen she returned she said: "O princess, this man is like unto a god. When he\napproacheth a low-built entrance he doth not stoop; the portal rises before\nhim. Much flesh was given unto him to prepare viands for Rituparna. He but\ngazed on the empty vessels and they were filled with water. No fire was lit,\nand he took a handful of withered grass and held it up to the sun, whereupon\nit blazed instantly, and oh! the marvel, his fingers were unscorched by the\nflames. Water flows at his will, and as quickly it vanisheth. And lo! I beheld\nanother marvel. When he lifted up flowers that had faded they were immediately\nrefreshed, so that they had greater beauty and richer fragrance than before."\n1\n\nDamayanti was fully assured that Vahuka was no other than her husband in\naltered form, and, weeping, she said softly: "Ah! go once again to the\nkitchen, fair Ke\xc5\x9bini, and obtain without his knowledge a small portion of the\nfood which he hath prepared."\n\nEre long the handmaiden returned with a morsel of well-cooked meat, and when\nDamayanti, who had oft-times tried the food which had been cooked by her\nhusband, tasted thereof, she uttered a loud cry in her anguish, and said: "Yon\ncharioteer is Nala!"\n\nThen she sipped water of ablution, 2 and sent her two children with Ke\xc5\x9bini to\nthe kitchen. Immediately that the charioteer beheld Indrasena and her brother\nhe embraced them tenderly: he gazed lovingly upon the children, who were as\nbeautiful as the children of the gods, and his soul was deeply moved, while\ntears ran down his cheeks. Seeing that the handmaiden observed him closely, he\nsaid: "Ah! the little ones are so like unto\n\np. 368\n\nmine own children that I could not restrain my tears. . . . Let us part now, O\ninnocent maiden; we are in a land of strangers, and if thou comest so often\nmen will speak ill of thee."\n\nWhen Damayanti was told how the charioteer had been so profoundly moved when\nhe saw the royal children, she sent Ke\xc5\x9bini unto her mother, the queen, for she\nwas impatient to behold her husband once again. The handmaiden spake to the\nqueen, saying: "Lo! we have observed the charioteer closely, and believe that\nhe is Nala, although misshapen of form. Damayanti is fain he would come before\nher, with or without the knowledge of her sire, and that quickly."\n\nThe queen at once went unto Bhima and told him all, and the rajah gave\npermission that the charioteer should be summoned. In an instant word was sent\nunto Nala, and soon he stood before Damayanti and gazed upon her, and was\nmoved to anguish. The princess was clad in a robe of scarlet, and her hair was\nthrown into disarray and defiled with dust: she wept and trembled with\nemotion.\n\nAt length Damayanti spoke, saying: "O Vahuka, hast thou ever heard of a noble\nand upright man who fled away, abandoning his sleeping wife in a forest?\nInnocent was she, and worn out with grief. Who was he who thus forsook his\nwife but the lordly Nala? . . . What offence did I give unto him that he\nshould have deserted me while I slept? Was he not chosen by me as mine husband\neven before the gods? . . . How could he abandon her who loved him--the mother\nof his children? . . . Before the celestial beings he pledged his faith. How\nhath he kept his vow?"\n\nShe spoke with broken voice, and her dark eyes were dewed by sorrow.\n\np. 369\n\nNala made answer, gazing upon his beloved wife, and said: "My kingdom I lost\nby the dice, but I was innocent of evil, because Kali possessed my soul, and\nby that demon was I also swayed to desert thee, O timid one! But thou didst\nsmite him with thy curse when thou wert in the forest mourning for me, yet he\nremained in my body until, in the end, he was conquered by my long-suffering\nand devotion. Lo! now, O beauteous one, our grief is nigh to its end. The evil\none hath departed, and through love of thee I come hither right speedily. . .\n. But how," he asked sternly, "may a high-born lady choose her another\nhusband, as thou wouldst fain do, even now, O faint heart? The heralds have\ngone up and down the land saying: \' _The daughter of Bhima will hold her\nsecond swayamvara because such is her fancy_.\' And for this reason Rituparna\nmade haste to come hither." 1\n\nDamayanti shook with emotion when these hard words were spoken, and she\naddressed Nala, saying: "Do not suspect me, O noble one, of such shameful\nguilt. It was for thee and thee alone that the Brahmans went forth repeating\nthe message which I addressed unto them. Lo! when I learned of the words thou\ndidst speak unto the wise Parnada, I conceived this stratagem with purpose to\nbring thee hither. Faithful of heart have I remained, nor ever have I thought\nevil of thee. I call upon the wind to slay me now if I have sinned: on the sun\nI call also and on the moon, which enters into every thought of living beings.\nLet these three gods who govern the three worlds 2 speak now to prove my\nwords, or else turn against me."\n\np. 370\n\nThen the wind which the princess had adjured spake from without and said: "O\nNala, Damayanti hath done no evil, nor hath she thought on evil. For three\nlong years she hath treasured up her virtue in its fullness. She speaketh what\nis true even now. Thou hast found the daughter of Bhima: the daughter of Bhima\nhath found thee. Take now thine own wife to thy bosom."\n\nEven as the wind was speaking, flowers fell out of heaven all around them, 1\nand the soft music of the gods floated down the wind. Nala marvelled greatly,\nand gazed with love upon the innocent Damayanti. Then he put on the holy\ngarment and thought upon the king of serpents. Immediately he resumed his own\nform, and the daughter of Bhima beheld her lost husband once again.\n\nDamayanti shrieked and embraced Nala, and she hid her face in his bosom. He\nwas again travel-worn and dust-stained as he clasped her to his heart, and she\nsighed softly. Long they stood there, speaking no words, in silent ecstasy. .\n. . The children were brought in and Nala embraced them once more.\n\nThen did the queen, who rejoiced greatly, inform Bhima of Nala\'s return, and\nhe said: "When he has performed his ablutions he will be re-united to\nDamayanti on the morrow."\n\nThe whole night long the happy pair sat together in the palace relating all\nthat had befallen them during the years that they were parted one from\nanother.\n\nOn the morn that followed Nala was again wedded to Damayanti, and thereafter\nhe paid homage to Bhima. The glad tidings of his return spread swiftly through\nthe city, and there was great rejoicing. Soon all the houses were decorated\nwith banners and garlands; the streets\n\np. 371\n\nwere watered and strewn with flowers. The altars of the gods were also\nadorned.\n\nWhen Rituparna came to know that his charioteer, Vahuka, was the Rajah of\nNishadha, he was well pleased, and he went into Nala\'s presence and said: "May\nthou have joy with thy queen to whom thou art re-united. Have I ever done\naught unjustly unto thee whilst thou wert in my palace? If so, I now seek thy\nforgiveness."\n\nSaid Nala, "No injustice have I ever suffered from thee, mine old friend and\nkinsman. . . . I give thee fully all I have--my skill in steeds."\n\nRituparna was grateful unto Nala for his gift. He gave in return fuller\ninstruction in the science of dice, and thereafter departed to his own city.\n\nWhen a month had gone past Nala took leave of King Bhima and went towards\nNishadha with one great chariot, sixteen elephants, fifty armed horsemen, and\nsix hundred foot soldiers. The whole force entered the city boldly and made\nthe earth to shake. Nala at once went before Pushkara and said: "I would fain\nthrow dice with thee once again. I have much wealth and will stake all my\ntreasure and even Damayanti upon the hazard. Thou, Pushkara, must stake thy\nkingdom. Let us stake everything; let us play for our lives. And know, too,\nthat, according to ancient law, he who wins a kingdom by gambling must accept\nthe challenge to play the counter game. . . . If thou wilt not play, then let\nus settle our difference in single combat."\n\nPushkara restrained from smiling, for he was confident of success, so with\nhaughty contempt he made answer:\n\n"It is joy to me that thou dost again possess great treasure to enable thee to\nplay. It is joy also to me that I can win Damayanti with faultless limbs.\nSoon,\n\np. 372\n\nindeed, will Bhima\'s daughter be decorated with the treasure which I shall\nwin; she shall stand by my side as Apsaras, queen of heaven, stands beside\nIndra. Long have I waited for thee so that I might win Damayanti and be fully\nsatisfied."\n\nNala would fain have drawn his sword, but composed himself, and, with angry\neyes and scornful smile, he said: "Cease this idle chatter and let us play.\nThereafter thou wilt have no desire to speak."\n\nImmediately the two brothers set to the game, and Nala won at a single hazard\nall that he had lost. Then he smiled and said: "Now the whole kingdom is mine\nonce again. Fallen monarch! never wilt thou behold the fair Damayanti because\nthou art become her slave. . . . Know now, that thou didst not triumph\nheretofore by reason of thine own skill, but because Kali aided thee, nor\ndidst thou perceive this, O fool! . . . But fear not that I will take\nvengeance. . . . I give thee back thy life. Thou wilt have an estate and\nrevenues and my friendship, because I remember, O Pushkara, that thou art my\nbrother. . . . Mayst thou live for a hundred years!"\n\nThen Nala embraced his brother, who did homage with hands folded, saying: "May\nthy splendour endure for ever! May thou live for ten thousand years! Thou hast\ngiven me my life and a city in which to live."\n\nPushkara remained with Nala for a month, and then went his way to his own\ndomain.\n\nAll Nishadha rejoiced because that their rightful king had returned. The\ncounsellors of state did homage before Nala, and said: "There is great joy now\nin city and country, and the people come to honour thee even as Indra is\nhonoured by all the gods."\n\nWhen the rejoicings were over, and the city of Nishadha\n\np. 373\n\nwas again tranquil, Damayanti returned home escorted by a great army, and she\nbrought great treasures which her royal sire Bhima, the terrible in strength,\nhad conferred upon her. With the long-eyed queen came her children also.\n\nThereafter Nala lived in happiness like unto the mighty Indra, being happily\nrestored to his kingdom, and once again the monarch among men. He achieved\ngreat renown as a ruler, and he performed every holy rite with munificence and\ndevotion.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[367:1](iml28.htm#fr_321) The powers given Nala by the gods as marriage gifts\nare here illustrated.\n\n[367:2](iml28.htm#fr_322) A part of the ceremony of purification.
