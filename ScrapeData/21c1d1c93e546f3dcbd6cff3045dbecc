But (the pra _n_ a is subordinate to the soul) like the eye, &c., on\naccount of being taught with them (the eye, &c.), and for other reasons.\n\nThe word 'but' sets aside the independence of the pra _n_ a. As the eye and so\non stand, like the subjects of a king, in mere subordinate relation to the\nacting and enjoying of the soul and are not independent, so the chief vital\nair also, occupying a position analogous to that of a king's minister, stands\nin an entirely subordinate relation to the soul and is not independent.--Why?\n--Because it is taught (spoken of) together with them, i.e. the eye and the\nother organs, in such passages as the colloquy of the pra _n_ as, &c. For to\nbe mentioned together is appropriate only in the case of things with the same\nattributes, as e.g. the B _ri_ hat-saman and the Rathantara-saman. 1 The words\n'and so on' (in the Sutra) indicate other reasons refuting the independence of\nthe pra _n_ a, such as its being composed of parts, its being of a non-\nintelligent nature and the like.--Well, but if it be admitted that the pra _n_\na stands to the soul in the relation of an instrument as the eye and so on. it\nwill follow that we must assume another sense-object analogous to colour and\nso on. For the eyes, &c., occupy their specific subordinate position with\nregard to the soul through their functions which consist in the seeing of\ncolour and so on. Now we can enumerate only eleven classes of functions, viz.\nthe seeing of colour and so on, on whose account we assume eleven different\npra _n_ as, and there is no twelfth class of effects on account of which a\ntwelfth pra _n_ a could be assumed.--To this objection the following Sutra\nreplies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[88:1](sbe38064.htm#fr_58) Which go together because they are both samans.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 11](sbe38065.htm)\n\n"
