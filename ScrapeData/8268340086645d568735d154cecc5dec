In the eleventh year after the conception a Kshatriya,\n\n3\\. In the twelfth year after the conception a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n4\\. Until the sixteenth year the time has not passed for a Brahma _n_ a, until\nthe twenty-second for a Kshatriya, until the twenty-fourth for a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n5. 5 After that (time has passed), they become patitasavitrika (i.e. they have lost their right of being taught the Savitri).\n\n6\\. Let them not initiate such men, nor teach them, nor perform sacrifices for\nthem, nor form matrimonial alliances with them.\n\n7\\. On the day on which the youth is going to receive the initiation, on that\nday, early in the morning, they give him to eat, and have his hair arranged,\nand wash him, and deck him with ornaments, and put on him a (new) garment\nwhich has not yet been washed.\n\np. 64\n\n8. 8 Their garments are made of linen, of hempen cloth, of cotton, or of wool (according to the caste to which the student belongs).\n\n9\\. The skins (which they wear), are an antelope-skin, or the skin of a\nspotted deer, or a goat's skin.\n\n10. 10 Their girdles are made of Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass, of Ka _s_ a grass, of Tambala.\n\n11\\. Their staffs are of Par _n_ a wood, of Bilva wood, of A _s_ vattha wood.\n\n12\\. The garment of a Brahma _n_ a is made of linen, or of hempen cloth, that\nof a Kshatriya, of cotton, that of a Vai _s_ ya, of wool.\n\n13. 13 Thereby also the other articles have been explained.\n\n14\\. Or if (the proper articles prescribed) cannot be got, all (of them may be\nused) by (persons of) all castes.\n\n15. 15 To the east of the house on a surface besmeared (with cow-dung) wood has been put on the fire.\n\n16\\. Having sacrificed with (the Mantras which the student recites) 'Agni!\nLord of the vow' (MB. I, 6, 9-13), the teacher stations himself to the west\n\np. 65\n\nof the fire, on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.\n\n17\\. Between the fire and the teacher the student (stands), raising his joined\nhands, turning his face towards the teacher, on northward-pointed Darbha\ngrass.\n\n18\\. Standing on his south side a Brahma _n_ a versed in the Mantras fills\n(the student's) joined hands with water,\n\n19\\. And afterwards (those) of the teacher.\n\n20\\. Looking (at the student the teacher) murmurs (the verse), 'With him who\ncomes to us, we have come together' (MB. I, 6, 14).\n\n21\\. He causes (the student) to say, 'I have come hither to studentship'\n(ibid. 16).\n\n22. 22 In (the words), 'What is thy name' (ibid. 17), he asks after his name.\n\n23\\. The teacher chooses for him a name which he is to use at respectful\nsalutations,\n\n24\\. (A name) derived from (the name of) a deity or a Nakshatra,\n\n25\\. Or also of his Gotra, according to some (teachers).\n\n26\\. Having let the water run out of his joined\n\np. 66\n\nhands (over the student's hands), the teacher with his right hand seizes (the\nstudent's) right hand together with the thumb, with (the formula), 'By the\nimpulse of the god Savit _ri_ , with the arms of the two A _s_ vins, with\nPushan's hands I seize thy hand, N.N.!' (ibid. 18).\n\n27\\. He then makes him turn round from left to right with (the formula), 'Move\nin the sun's course after him, N.N.!' (ibid. 19).\n\n28\\. Grasping down with his right hand over his right shoulder he should touch\nhis uncovered navel with (the formula), 'Thou art the knot of all breath'\n(ibid. 20).\n\n29\\. Raising himself (from the position implied in Sutra 28, he should touch)\nthe place near the navel with (the formula), 'Ahura' (ibid. 21).\n\n30\\. Raising himself (still more, he should touch) the place of the heart with\n(the formula), 'K _ri_ _s_ ana' (ibid. 22).\n\n31\\. Having touched from behind with his right hand (the student's) right\nshoulder with (the formula), 'I give thee in charge to Pra _g_ apati, N.N.!'\n(ibid. 23)\xc2\x97\n\n32\\. And with his left (hand) the left (shoulder) with (the formula), 'I give\nthee in charge to the god Savit _ri_ , N.N.!' (ibid. 24)\xc2\x97\n\n33. 33 He then directs him (to observe the duties of Brahma _k_ arya, by the formula), 'A student art thou, N.N.!' (ibid. 25).\n\n34\\. 'Put on fuel. Eat water. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time'\n(ibid. 26).\n\n35\\. Having gone in a northerly direction from\n\np. 67\n\nthe fire, the teacher sits down to the east, on northward-pointed Darbha\ngrass,\n\n36\\. The student to the west, bending his right knee, turning his face towards\nthe teacher, also on northward-pointed Darbha grass.\n\n37\\. (The teacher) then ties round (the student) thrice from left to right the\ngirdle made of Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass and causes him to repeat (the verse),\n'Protecting us from evil word' (ibid. 27), and (the verse), 'The protectress\nof right' (ibid. 28).\n\n38\\. Then (the student) respectfully sits down near (the teacher) with (the\nwords), 'Recite, sir! May the reverend one recite the Savitri to me.'\n\n39\\. He then recites (the Savitri, ibid. 29) to him, Pada by Pada, hemistich\nby hemistich, and the whole verse,\n\n40\\. And the Mahavyah _ri_ tis one by one, with the word Om at the end (ibid.\n30).\n\n41\\. And handing over to him the staff, which should be made of (the wood of)\na tree, he causes him to repeat (the formula), 'O glorious one, make me\nglorious' (ibid. 31).\n\n42\\. Then (the student) goes to beg food,\n\n43\\. First of his mother, and of two other women friends, or of as many as\nthere are in the neighbourhood.\n\n44\\. He announces the alms (received) to his teacher.\n\n45\\. The rest of the day he stands silently.\n\n46\\. After sunset he puts a piece of wood on the fire with (the Mantra), 'To\nAgni I have brought a piece of wood' (ibid. 32).\n\n47\\. Through a period of three nights he avoids eating pungent or saline food.\n\np. 68\n\n48\\. At the end of that (period) a mess of boiled rice-grains (is offered) to\nSavit _ri_.\n\n49. 49 Then he may do what he likes.\n\n50\\. A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.\n\nEnd of the Second Prapa _th_ aka.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[63:1](sbe30022.htm#fr_249) 10, 1 seq. The initiation of the student.\nKhadira-G _ri_ hya II, 4, 1 seq.\n\n[63:4](sbe30022.htm#fr_250) 1-4. On the number of years given for the\nUpanayana of persons of the three castes, see the note on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_\nhya II, I, 1.\n\n[63:5](sbe30022.htm#fr_251) 5, 6. See the note on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya II,\nI, 9.\n\n[64:8](sbe30022.htm#fr_252) There are four kinds of garments indicated, though\nonly persons of three castes are concerned. The explanation of this apparent\nincongruence follows from Sutra 12.\n\n[64:10](sbe30022.htm#fr_253) Tambala is stated to be a synonym for _s_ a _n_ a\n(hemp).\n\n[64:13](sbe30022.htm#fr_254) As the garments indicated in Sutra 8 belong, in\nthe order in which they are stated, to persons of the three castes\nrespectively, thus also of the skins (Sutra 9), of the girdles (Sutra 10), and\nof the staffs (Sutra 11); the first is that belonging to a Brahma _n_ a, the\nsecond, to a Kshatriya, and the third, to a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n[64:15](sbe30022.htm#fr_255) Comp. above, chap. 9, 2.\n\n[65:22](sbe30022.htm#fr_256) 22, 23. It is evident that the words tasya _k_\narya _h_ belong to Sutra 23, and not to Sutra 22, to which the traditional\ndivision of the Sutras assigns them. The corresponding section of the Mantra-\nBrahma _n_ a runs thus: 'What is thy name?'\xc2\x97'My name is N.N.!' It is not clear\nwhether the student, being questioned by the teacher, had to indicate his\nordinary name, and then to receive from the teacher his 'abhivadaniya\nnamadheya,' or whether he had to pronounce, on the teacher's question,\ndirectly the abhivadaniya name chosen for him by the teacher. The commentary\nand the corresponding passage of the Khadira-G _ri_ hya (II, 4, 12) are in\nfavour of the second alternative.\n\n[66:33](sbe30022.htm#fr_257) 33, 34. Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya II, 4, 5\nnote.\n\n[68:49](sbe30022.htm#fr_258) 49, 50. Dr. Knauer very pertinently calls\nattention to the fact that these Sutras are not repeated, as is the rule with\nregard to the concluding words of an Adhyaya or Prapa _th_ aka.
