And the best.\n\nBy 'the best' we have to understand the chief vital air (mukhya pra _n_ a),\nwhich, in the colloquy of the pra _n_ as, is determined to be the best because\nit is the cause of the preservation of the body. This chief vital air the\nPurvapakshin maintains to be something non-created, since Scripture ( _Ri_. Sa\n_m_ h. V, 129, 2), 'By its own law the One was breathing without wind,' shows\nthat an effect of it, viz. the act of breathing, existed even previously to\ncreation, at the time of a great pralaya; and because texts declaring it to\nhave been created--such as 'from him is born breath' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3)--may\nbe interpreted in the same way as the texts declaring that the soul is\nsomething created (sec p. 540 ff.).--To this the reply is that, since this\nview contradicts scriptural statements as to the oneness of all, previous to\ncreation; and since the Mu _nd_ aka-text declares the pra _n_ a to have been\ncreated in the same way as earth and the other elements; and since there are\nno texts plainly denying its createdness, the chief vital air also must\n\np. 573\n\nbe held to have been created. The words 'the One was breathing without wind'\nby no means refer to the vital breath of living creatures, but intimate the\nexistence of the highest Brahman, alone by itself; as indeed appears from the\nqualification 'without wind.'--That the vital breath, although really disposed\nof in the preceding Sutras, is specially mentioned in the present Sutra, is\nwith a view to the question next raised for consideration.--Here terminates\nthe adhikara _n_ a of 'the minuteness of the pra _n_ as.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8.
