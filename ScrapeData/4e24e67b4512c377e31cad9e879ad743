Our\nconversation nowadays has become full of modern sex-problems, and various\nother matters, with a sprinkling of poetry, both old Vaishnava and modern\nEnglish, accompanied by a running undertone of melody, low down in the bass,\nsuch as I have never in my life heard before, which seems to me to sound the\ntrue manly note, the note of power.\n\nThe day had come when all cover was gone. There was no longer even the\npretence of a reason why Sandip Babu should linger on, or why I should have\nconfidential talks with him every now and then. I felt thoroughly vexed with\nmyself, with my sister-in-law, with the ways of the world, and I vowed I would\nnever again go to the outer apartments, not if I were to die for it.\n\nFor two whole days I did not stir out. Then, for the first time, I discovered\nhow far I had travelled. My life felt utterly tasteless. Whatever I touched I\nwanted to thrust away. I felt myself waiting--from the crown of my head to the\ntips of my toes-- waiting for something, somebody; my blood kept tingling with\nsome expectation.\n\nI tried busying myself with extra work. The bedroom floor was clean enough but\nI insisted on its being scrubbed over again under my eyes. Things were\narranged in the cabinets in one kind of order; I pulled them all out and\nrearranged them in a different way. I found no time that afternoon even to do\nup my hair; I hurriedly tied it into a loose knot, and went and worried\neverybody, fussing about the store-room. The stores seemed short, and\npilfering must have been going on of late, but I could not muster up the\ncourage to take any particular person to task-- for might not the thought have\ncrossed somebody\'s mind: "Where were your eyes all these days!"\n\nIn short, I behaved that day as one possessed. The next day I tried to do some\nreading. What I read I have no idea, but after a spell of absentmindedness I\nfound I had wandered away, book in hand, along the passage leading towards the\nouter apartments, and was standing by a window looking out upon the verandah\nrunning along the row of rooms on the opposite side of the quadrangle. One of\nthese rooms, I felt, had crossed over to another shore, and the ferry had\nceased to ply. I felt like the ghost of myself of two days ago, doomed to\nremain where I was, and yet not really there, blankly looking out for ever.\n\nAs I stood there, I saw Sandip come out of his room into the verandah, a\nnewspaper in his hand. I could see that he looked extraordinarily disturbed.\nThe courtyard, the railings, in front, seemed to rouse his wrath. He flung\naway his newspaper with a gesture which seemed to want to rend the space\nbefore him.\n\nI felt I could no longer keep my vow. I was about to move on towards the\nsitting-room, when I found my sister-in-law behind me. "O Lord, this beats\neverything!" she ejaculated, as she glided away. I could not proceed to the\nouter apartments.\n\nThe next morning when my maid came calling, "Rani Mother, it is getting late\nfor giving out the stores," I flung the keys to her, saying, "Tell Harimati to\nsee to it," and went on with some embroidery of English pattern on which I was\nengaged, seated near the window.\n\nThen came a servant with a letter. "From Sandip Babu," said he. What unbounded\nboldness! What must the messenger have thought? There was a tremor within my\nbreast as I opened the envelope. There was no address on the letter, only the\nwords:\n\n_\n\nAn urgent matter--touching the Cause. Sandip_.\n\nI flung aside the embroidery. I was up on my feet in a moment, giving a touch\nor two to my hair by the mirror. I kept the _sari_ I had on, changing only my\njacket--for one of my jackets had its associations.\n\nI had to pass through one of the verandahs, where my sister-in-law used to sit\nin the morning slicing betel-nut. I refused to feel awkward. "Whither away,\nChota Rani?" she cried.\n\n"To the sitting-room outside."\n\n"So early! A matinee, eh?"\n\nAnd, as I passed on without further reply, she hummed after me a flippant\nsong.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX](hw15.htm)\n\n'
