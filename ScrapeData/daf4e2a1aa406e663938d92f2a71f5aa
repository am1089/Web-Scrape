The Subtle Body.--According to the later Ved\xc4\x81nta, the Soul in its\nwanderings from birth to birth is accompanied by the sense-organs and\n"breaths" as sums of potential faculties, and has for its vehicle the "subtle\nbody," _s \xc5\xabkshma\xc5\x9bar\xc4\xabra._ The latter consists of portions of the five elements\nin their higher suprasensual form, and thus is as it were a seed which on\noccasion grows by the accession of gross matter into a physical body.\n\nThere is no clear evidence for the existence of\n\np. 46\n\nthis idea in the Upanishads until the mention of a _linga_ (the term used in\nthe S\xc4\x81nkhya school for "subtle body") in B.A. IV. iv. 6; cf. Ka\xe1\xb9\xadh. VI. 8,\n\xc5\x9avet. VI. 9, Maitr. VI. 10. For \xc5\x9aankara\'s view see especially on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra,\nIII. i. 1 f., IV. ii. 6 f. The "subtle body" adheres to the soul until it\nattains perfect enlightenment and release in Brahma; the souls which never\nreach this goal are always attended by it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Karma](brk23.htm)\n\n'
