S\xc5\xabta said: Having heard this, Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da, trembling like a leaf of the holy\nfig-tree, again questioned Ke\xc5\x9bava for the benefit of men.\n\n2\\. Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: Tell me by what means men who have committed sins unknowingly\nor knowingly escape from the torments of the servants of Yama.\n\n3-4. For those men who are immersed in the ocean of transmigration, of weak\nintelligence, their reason clouded by sin, their self dimmed by attachment to\nsense-objects--\n\nFor their uplifting tell me, O Lord, the exact meaning of the Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as; and the\nmeans by which people attain a happy condition, O M\xc4\x81dhava.\n\n5\\. The Blessed Lord said: O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, you have done well in asking for the\nbenefit of men, Listen attentively, and I will tell you all.\n\n6\\. Hard indeed, as already said, is the fate of the sinful and those without\nsons; but never so, O Lord of Birds, that of those who have sons and who are\nrighteous,\n\np. 53\n\n7\\. If by any past action of his the birth of a son has been prevented, then\nsome means should be taken for obtaining a son.\n\n8\\. Having listened to the Harivan\xc5\x9ba, or performed the \xc5\x9aatacha\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\xab, or\nworshipped the Blessed \xc5\x9aiva with devotion, the intelligent should beget a son.\n\n9\\. The son saves his father from the hell called Put; therefore he was named\n"putra" by the Self-existent himself.\n\n10\\. Even a single son, if righteous, carries the whole family over. \'By the\nson he conquers the worlds,\' is the ancient saying.\n\n11\\. The Vedas also proclaim the great importance of the son. Accordingly,\nhaving seen the face of a son, one is released from the debt to the\nforefathers.\n\n12\\. By the touch of his grandson a mortal is released from the three-fold\ndebt. With the help of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons he goes from the\nworlds and obtains heaven.\n\n13\\. The son of a Br\xc4\x81hma marriage uplifts, but the illegitimate drags down.\nKnowing this, O Best of Birds, one should avoid a woman of lower caste.\n\n14\\. Sons having father and mother of the same caste are legitimate, O Bird.\nThey alone, by making \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha-gifts are the means of their fathers\' attaining\nheaven.\n\np. 54\n\n15\\. Need I say one attains heaven by means of the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha performed by a son,\nwhen a Departed One went to heaven even when it was offered by another. Now\nlisten.\n\n16\\. Concerning this I will give you, from ancient history, an example of the\nefficacy of gifts for the higher body.\n\n17-19. Formerly, in the Treta age, T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, there reigned over the delightful\ncity of Mahodaya a king named Babhruv\xc4\x81hana, who was very powerful, and firm in\nrighteousness,\n\nA sacrificer, Lord of Gifts, prosperous, a lover of Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87s, valuing the\ngood, endowed with good character and of good conduct, compassionate, skilled,\n\nRighteously protecting his subjects as though they were his own sons, always\ndelighting in K\xe1\xb9\xa3attriya duties, and punishing the guilty.\n\n20-21. Once, that powerful king, with his army, went hunting. He entered a\nthick forest, full of various kinds of trees,\n\nCrowded with various species of animals, and resounding with the cries of\nvarious birds. In the midst of the forest the king saw a deer in the distance.\n\n22\\. The deer, severely wounded by his very hard arrow, ran out of sight into\nthe interior of the forest, carrying the arrow with him.\n\n23\\. The king, following the blood-stains on the grass, pursued the deer and\ncame into another forest.\n\np. 55\n\n24\\. That leader of men, hungry and with parched throat, fainting with the\nheat and with fatigue, coming to a lake bathed in it with his horse.\n\n25-27. Then, having drunk of that cool water, rendered fragrant by the-pollen\nof the lotus, Babhruv\xc4\x81hana came out of the water refreshed,\n\nAnd saw a delightful fig-tree, giving cool shade with its large spreading\nboughs, sounding with many birds,\n\nAnd standing like a big standard over the whole forest. The king approached\nand sat at its root.\n\n28\\. Now he beheld a Departed One, of terrible appearance, humpbacked and\nfleshless, with hair erect, dirty, and with senses discomposed by hunger and\nthirst.\n\n29-31. Seeing him deformed and dreadful Babhruv\xc4\x81hana wondered. The Departed\nOne, also seeing the king who had come to that dreadful forest,\n\nAnd becoming filled with curiosity, came near to him. Then, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, this\nking of the Departed spoke thus to the king:\n\n"I have escaped the condition of the Departed and reached the highest\ncondition, by being in touch with you, O Great-Armed one,--I am highly\nblessed."\n\np. 56\n\n32-33. The king said: "O Black-complexioned and Gaping-mouthed, by what bad\ndeeds did you reach this state of the Departed, dreadful to see, and highly\nunhappy?"\n\n"Tell me in detail the cause of your condition, dear. Who are you, and by what\ngifts will your condition as Departed pass away?"\n\n34-38. The Departed one said: "I will tell you everything from the beginning,\nO Best of Kings. You will surely have compassion upon me when you have heard\nthe cause of my condition as Departed,\n\n"There is a town named Vaida\xc5\x9ba, possessed of all prosperity, having many\ndistricts, and abounding in precious stones of various kinds,\n\n"Beautiful with palaces and mansions, and in which many religious acts are\nperformed. There, O Reverend Sir, I dwelt, always engaged in worship of the\nShining Ones.\n\n"By caste I am a Vaishya, by name Sudeva, please know. By fire-offering I\npleased the Shining Ones, and likewise the forefathers by food.\n\n"I gladdened the twice-born by offering various gifts. I gave food of various\nkinds to the poor, the blind and the wretched.\n\n39-41. "All this, O King, through my evil fate has proved fruitless. How my\ngood deeds proved fruitless I will relate to you.\n\np. 57\n\n"I have no offspring, no companion, no relative and no friend like you, who\nwill perform for me the ceremonies for the-higher body.\n\n"If the sixteen monthly \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddhas, O great king, are not performed, the\ncondition as Departed becomes firmly fixed, even if hundreds of annual\n\xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddhas are performed for him.\n\n42-45. "Uplift me then, O Lord of Earth, by doing the ceremonies for my higher\nbody. It is said that in this world the king is the kinsman of all castes.\n\n"Therefore, O Lord of Kings, help me over, and I will give you a most precious\njewel, so that my departed condition may be destroyed, and my higher state\narise.\n\n"In that manner please act, O warrior, if you desire my welfare. Suffering\nfrom the misery of hunger and thirst, I cannot endure this departed condition.\n\n"In this forest there is sweet and cool water, and pleasant fruits, but I am\nnot able to grasp them at all, although afflicted with hunger and thirst.\n\n46-48. "If the great N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a rite is performed for me, O King, along with all\nthe ceremonies for the higher body, with Vaidic mantras,\n\n"Then surely my condition as departed will unfailingly pass away. Vaidic\nmantras, austerities, gifts, and compassion to all beings,\n\n"Listening to holy scriptures, worship of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, association with the good,--\nthese, I have heard, are the destroyers of the departed condition.\n\np. 58\n\n49-50. "So I will tell you about the worship of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, the destroyer of the\ndeparted condition. Bring two pieces of gold, honestly gained, and make one\nimage of N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a from them, O King.\n\n"Dress it with a pair of yellow cloths, put on it various ornaments, bathe it\nin many waters,--and placing it, you should worship thus.\n\n51-56. "Place \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xabdhara 1 to the east of it, Madhus\xc5\xabdana 2 to the south, to the\nwest V\xc4\x81manadeva 3, to the north Gad\xc4\x81dhara, 4\n\n"In the middle Pit\xc4\x81maha 5 and also Mahe\xc5\x9bwara. 5 Worship these in turn with\nsandal-paste and flowers, according to the rite.\n\n"Then, having gone round them, make offerings in the fire to these deities.\nMake offerings to the universal deities with clarified butter, curds and milk.\n\n"Next, having bathed, calm and controlled in mind, the sacrificer should\nperform, according to the rite, in front of N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, the ceremony for the\nupper body.\n\n"He must commence, as prescribed in the scriptures, by giving up anger and\ngreed, and perform all the ceremonies and the release of a bull.\n\np. 59\n\n"Then he must give thirteen sets of pots to Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s, and having made the gift\nof a bed, consecrate a pot of water for the sake of the departed."\n\n57\\. The king said, "How is the pot for the departed to be prepared, and in\naccordance with what: rites must it be given? Tell me, on account of my\nsympathy for all, about the pot which gives release to the departed."\n\n58-63. The departed said: "Oh Great King, you have done well in asking this.\nPlease take notice and l will describe that good gift by which the departed\ncondition cannot exist.\n\n"The gift which is named \'the pot for the departed,\' is a destroyer of all\nevil. In all the worlds it is difficult to obtain this dissipator of evil\nconditions.\n\n"Having prepared a pot of refined gold, consecrated it to Brahm\xc4\x81, \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9ba 1 and\nKe\xc5\x9bava 2, and all the guardians of the quarters, filled it with clarified\nbutter and worshipped before it with devotion, give it to a twice-born. What\ngood are a hundred other gifts from you?\n\np. 60\n\n"Brahm\xc4\x81 in the middle, likewise Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, and \xc5\x9aa\xe1\xb9\x85kara, eternal giver of\nhappiness; in the east and other directions, in the neck of it, the guardians\nof the universe, in order--\n\n"These having duly worshipped, O King, with incenses, flowers and sandal-\npaste, one should give away the golden pot, full of milk and clarified butter.\n\n"This gift, O King, which is superior to all other gifts in removing great\nsins, should be made with faith, for the release of the departed."\n\n64-65. The Blessed Lord spoke on: His army, while he was thus conversing with\nthe departed, followed him up, with elephants, horses and chariots, O K\xc4\x81\xc5\x9byapa.\n\nOn the arrival of the army the departed one, having given the great jewel to\nthe king, bowed to him, again implored him, and became invisible.\n\n66-68. Having come out of the forest, the king returned to his city, and\narrived there remembering all that was said by the departed one.\n\nHe duly performed; O Bird, the rites and ceremonies for the dweller in the\nupper body, and the departed, released by these sacred gifts, attained heaven.\n\nBy the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha, performed even by a stranger, the departed attain a happy\nstate,--what wonder then that when the son performs it the father should reach\nit!\n\n60\\. He who hears, and he who causes others to hear this holy history, never\ngo to the departed condition, though they may. have acted sinfully.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:1](gpu09.htm#fr_60) Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, a form of.\n\n[58:2](gpu09.htm#fr_61) Another form of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, slayer of the demon Madhu.\n\n[58:3](gpu09.htm#fr_62) The divine dwarf Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\n[58:4](gpu09.htm#fr_63) The club-bearing Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\n[58:5](gpu09.htm#fr_65) A name for \xc5\x9aiva.\n\n[59:1](gpu09.htm#fr_66) \xc5\x9aiva.\n\n[59:2](gpu09.htm#fr_67) Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII.
