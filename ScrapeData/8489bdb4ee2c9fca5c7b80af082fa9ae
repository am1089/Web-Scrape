Wilkins, [1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 13\n\n### CHAPTER III.\n\n#### DYAUS AND PRITHIVI.\n\nThe general opinion respecting Dyaus (Heaven) and Prithivi (Earth) is that\nthey are amongst the most ancient of the Aryan deities, hence they are spoken\nof in the hymns of the Rig-Veda as the parents of the other gods. * They are\ndescribed as "great, wise and energetic;" those who "promote righteousness,\nand lavish gifts upon their worshippers." And in another place they are said\nto have "made all creatures," and through their favour "immortality is\nconferred upon their offspring." Not only are they the creators, but also the\npreservers of all creatures; and are beneficent and kind to all. In other\npassages Heaven and Earth are said to have been formed by Indra, who is\ndeclared to transcend them in greatness, whom they follow "as a chariot\nfollows the horse." They are described as bowing down before him; as trembling\nwith fear on account of him; and as being subject to his control. Again, they\nare said to have been formed by Soma; and in other verses other deities are\nsaid to have made them. This confusion of thought respecting the origin of the\ngods led very naturally to the question being asked in other hymns, "How have\nthey been produced? Who of the sages knows?"\n\np. 14\n\nThere seems to be considerable ground for the opinion that Indra gradually\nsuperseded Dyaus in the worship of the Hindus soon after their settlement in\nIndia. As the praises of the newer god were sung, the older one was forgotten;\nand in the present day, whilst Dyaus is almost unknown, Indra is still\nworshipped, though in the Vedas both are called the god of heaven. The\nfollowing statement of Professor Benfey * gives a natural explanation of this.\n"It may be distinctly shown that Indra took the place of the god of heaven,\nwho, in the Vedas, is invoked in the vocative as Dyauspitar (Heaven-father).\nThis is proved by the fact that this phrase is exactly reflected in the Latin\nJupiter, and the Greek Ze\xc5\xab-pater as a religious formula, fixed, like many\nothers, before the separation of the languages. When the Sanskrit people left\nthe common country, where for them, as well as for other kindred tribes, the\nbrilliant radiance of heaven appeared to them, in consequence of the climate\nthere prevailing, as the holiest thing, and settled in sultry India, where the\nglow of the heavens is destructive, and only its rain operates beneficially,\nthis aspect of the Deity must have appeared the most adorable, so that the\nepithet Pluvius, in a certain sense, absorbed all the other characteristics of\nDyauspitar. This found its expression in the name In-dra, in which we\nunhesitatingly recognize a word (which arose in some local dialect, and was\nthen diffused with the spread of the worship) standing for Sind-ra, which\nagain was derived from Syand, \'to drop.\' The conceptions which had been\nattached to Dyaus were then transferred to Indra." The opinion that Indra has\ntaken the place of Dyaus is now pretty generally believed, and the above\nexplanation appears natural.\n\nOf Prithivi we hear again. The "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0\n\np. 15\n\ngives the following account of her birth. There was a king named Ven\xc4\x81,\nnotorious for his wickedness and general neglect of religious duties. When the\nRishis of that age could bear with his impiety no longer, they slew him. But\nnow a worse evil happened; anarchy prevailed, and they felt that a bad king\nwas better than none at all. Upon this they rubbed the thigh of Ven\xc4\x81, when\nthere came forth a black dwarf, resembling a negro in appearance. Immediately\nafter his birth the dwarf asked, "What am I to do?" He is told, "Nis\xc4\xabda" (sit\ndown), and from this his descendants are called "Nisidis" unto this day. The\ncorpse was now pure, as all sin had left it in the body of this black dwarf.\nThe right arm was then rubbed, and from it there came a beautiful shining\nprince, who was named Prithu, and reigned in the place of his father. Now\nduring his reign there was a terrible famine. As the Earth would not yield her\nfruits, great distress prevailed. Prithu said, "I will slay the Earth, and\nmake her yield her fruits." Terrified at this threat, the Earth assumed the\nform of a cow, and was pursued by Prithu, even to the heaven of Brahm\xc4\x81. At\nlength, weary with the chase, she turned to him and said, "Know you not the\nsin of killing a female, that you thus try to slay me?" The king replied that\n"when the happiness of many is secured by the destruction of one malignant\nbeing, the slaughter of that being is an act of virtue." "But," said the\nEarth, "if, in order to promote the welfare of your subjects, you put an end\nto me, whence, best of monarchs, will thy people derive their support?"\nOvercome at length, the Earth declared that all vegetable products were old,\nand destroyed by her, but that at the king\'s command she would restore them\n"as developed from her milk." "Do you, therefore, for the benefit of mankind,\ngive me that\n\np. 16\n\ncalf by which I may be able to secrete milk. Make also all places level, so\nthat I may cause my milk, the seed of all vegetation, to flow everywhere\naround."\n\nPrithu acted upon this advice. "Before his time there was no cultivation, no\npasture, no agriculture, no highways for merchants; all these things (or all\ncivilization) originated in the reign of Prithu. Where the ground was made\nlevel, the king induced his subjects to take up their abode. . . . He\ntherefore having made Swayambhuva Manu the calf, milked the Earth, and\nreceived the milk into his own hand, for the benefit of mankind. Thence\nproceeded all kinds of corn and vegetables upon which people now subsist. By\ngranting life to the Earth, Prithu was as her father, and she thence derived\nthe patronymic appellation Prithivi."\n\nIn a note Professor Wilson adds, * the commentator observes that "by the\n\'calf,\' or Manu in that character, is typified the promoter of the\nmultiplication of progeny;" Manu, as will be seen in the account of the\nCreation, being regarded by some of the Pur\xc4\x81nas as the first parent of\nmankind. This legend, with considerable variation, is found in most of the\nPur\xc4\x81nas; Soma, Indra, Yama, and others taking the place of Manu as the calf,\nwhilst Prithu\'s place as the milker is taken by the Rishis, Mitra, etc. In the\nsame note Professor Wilson says, "These are all probably subsequent\nmodifications of the original simple allegory, which typified the earth as a\ncow, who yielded to every class of beings the milk that they desired, or the\nobject of their wishes."\n\nIt should be noticed that, later in the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," Prithivi is said to\nhave sprung from the foot of Vishnu.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[13:*](hmvp07.htm#fr_8) Muir, O.
