The Gayatri 3 (verse) is everything whatsoever here exists. Gayatri indeed\nis speech, for speech\n\np. 45\n\nsings forth (gaya-ti) and protects (traya-te) everything that here exists.\n\n2\\. That Gayatri is also the earth, for everything that here exists rests on\nthe earth, and does not go beyond.\n\n3\\. That earth again is the body in man, for in it the vital airs (pra _n_ as\n1, which are everything) rest, and do not go beyond.\n\n4\\. That body again in man is the heart within man, for in it the pra _n_ as\n(which are everything) rest, and do not go beyond.\n\n5\\. That Gayatri has four feet 2 and is sixfold 3. And this is also declared\nby a _Ri_ _k_ verse (Rig-Veda X, 90, 3):--\n\n6\\. 'Such is the greatness of it (of Brahman, under the disguise of Gayatri\n4); greater than it is the Person 5 (purusha). His feet are all things. The\nimmortal with three feet is in heaven (i. e. in himself).'\n\np. 46\n\n7\\. The Brahman which has been thus described (as immortal with three feet in\nheaven, and as Gayatri) is the same as the ether which is around us;\n\n8\\. And the ether which is around us, is the same as the ether which is within\nus. And the ether which is within us,\n\n9\\. That is the ether within the heart. That ether in the heart (as Brahman)\nis omnipresent and unchanging. He who knows this obtains omnipresent and\nunchangeable happiness.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[44:3](sbe01070.htm#fr_170) The Gayatri is one of the sacred metres, and is\nhere to be meditated on as Brahman. It is used in the sense of verse, and as\nthe name of a famous hymn. The Gayatri is often praised as the most powerful\nmetre, and whatever can be obtained by means of the recitation of Gayatri\nverses is described as the achievement of the Gayatri. The etymology of\ngayatri from gai and tra is, of course, fanciful.\n\n[45:1](sbe01070.htm#fr_171) The pra _n_ as may be meant for the five senses,\nas explained in _Kh_. I, 2, 1; II, 7, 1; or for the five breathings, as\nexplained immediately afterwards in III, 13, 1. The commentator sees in them\neverything that here exists ( _Kh_. Up. III, 15, 4), and thus establishes the\nlikeness between the body and the Gayatri. As Gayatri is the earth, and the\nearth the body, and the body the heart, Gayatri is in the end to be considered\nas the heart.\n\n[45:2](sbe01070.htm#fr_172) The four feet are explained as the four quarters\nof the Gayatri metre, of six syllables each. The Gayatri really consists of\nthree feet of eight syllables each.\n\n[45:3](sbe01070.htm#fr_173) The Gayatri has been identified with all beings,\nwith speech, earth, body, heart, and the vital airs, and is therefore called\nsixfold. This, at least, is the way in which the commentator accounts for the\nepithet 'sixfold.'\n\n[45:4](sbe01070.htm#fr_174) Of Brahman modified as Gayatri, having four feet,\nand being sixfold.\n\n[45:5](sbe01070.htm#fr_175) The real Brahman, unmodified by form and name.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 13](sbe01071.htm)\n\n"
