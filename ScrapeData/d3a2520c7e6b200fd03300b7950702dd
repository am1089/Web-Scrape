There are many that remind us of old Sanskrit sayings, of\nwhich there are several collections, all, however, in metrical form. The\nsayings of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a are different, because they are in prose,\nuttered evidently on the spur of the moment, and tinged here and there with\nEuropean ideas which must have reached Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a through his\nintercourse with Anglo-Indians, and not from books, for he was ignorant of\nEnglish. I received a complete collection of them from Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's\nown pupil, Vivekananda, well known by his missionary labours in the United\nStates and England. I give them as they were sent to me, with such corrections\nonly as seemed absolutely necessary. I thought at first of arranging them\nunder different heads, but found that this would have destroyed their\ncharacter and made them rather monotonous reading. I believe as they are, they\ngive a true picture of the man and of his way of teaching, suggested by the\nimpulses of the moment, but by no means systematic, and by no means free from\nrepetitions and contradictions. I should have liked very much to leave out\nsome of his sayings, because, to our mind, they seem insipid, in bad taste, or\neven blasphemous. But should I not in doing so have offended against historic\ntruth? We want to know the man who has exercised and is exercising so wide an\ninfluence, such as he was, not such as we wish him to have been. He himself\nnever wished to appear different from what he was, and he often seems to have\nmade himself out worse than he was. Besides, if I had done so, I know that\nthere are men who would not have been ashamed of suspecting me\n\np. 97\n\nof a wish to represent the religions of the East, both modern and ancient, as\nbetter than they really are. These are the very men who would find many a\nlesson to learn from Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's sayings. No, I said, let the wheat\nand the tares remain together. Few thoughtful readers will go through them\nwithout finding some thought that makes them ponder, some truth that will\nstartle them as coming from so unexpected a quarter. Nothing, on the other\nhand, would be easier than to pick out a saying here and there, and thus to\nshow that they are all insipid and foolish. This is a very old trick,\ndescribed in India as the trick of the rice-merchants who wish to sell or to\nbuy a rice-field, and who offer you a handful of good or bad grains to show\nthat the field is either valuable or worthless. To my mind these sayings, the\ngood, the bad, and the indifferent, are interesting because they represent an\nimportant phase of thought, an attempt to give prominence to the devotional\nand practical side of the Vedanta, and because they show the compatibility of\nthe Vedanta with other religions. They will make it clear that the Vedanta\nalso possesses a morality of its own, which may seem too high and too\nspiritual for ordinary mortals, but which in India has done good, is doing\ngood, and may continue to do good for centuries to come.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to thank my friend Mozoomdar, and several of the\ndisciples of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, more particularly Vivekananda and the editor\nof the Brahmavadin, for the ready help they have rendered me in publishing\nthis collection of the sayings of their departed Master.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Sayings of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a: 1-99](rls25.htm)\n\n"
