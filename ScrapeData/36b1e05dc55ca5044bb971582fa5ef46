Professor Cowell, in his edition and translation of it, calls it Maitri\nor Maitraya _n_ iya-upanishad, and states that it belongs to the Maitraya _n_\niya- _s_ akha of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda, and that it formed the concluding\nportion of a lost Brahma _n_ a of that _S_ akha, being preceded by the\nsacrificial (karma) portion, which consisted of four books.\n\nIn his MSS. the title varied between Maitry-upanishad and Maitri- _s_ akha-\nupanishad. A Poona MS. calls it Maitraya _n_ iya- _s_ akha-upanishad, and a\nMS. copied for Baron von Eckstein, Maitraya _n_ iyopanishad. I myself in the\nAlphabetical List of the Upanishads, published in the journal of\n\np. xliv\n\nthe German Oriental Society, called it, No. 104, Maitraya _n_ a or Maitri-\nupanishad, i.e. either the Upanishad of the Maitraya _n_ as, or the Upanishad\nof Maitri, the principal teacher.\n\nIn a MS. which I received from Dr. Burnell, the title of our Upanishad is\nMaitraya _n_ i-brahma _n_ a-upanishad, varying with Maitraya _n_ i-brahma _n_\na-upanishad, and Sriyagus _s_ akhayam Maitraya _n_ iya-brahma _n_ a-upanishad.\n\nThe next question is by what name this Upanishad is quoted by native\nauthorities. Vidyaranya, in his Sarvopanishad-arthanubhutipraka _s_ a 1, v. 1,\nspeaks of the Maitraya _n_ iyanamni ya _g_ ushi _s_ akha, and he mentions\nMaitra (not Maitri) as the author of that _S_ akha. (vv. 55,150).\n\nIn the Muktika-upanishad 2 we meet with the name of Maitraya _n_ i as the\ntwenty-fourth Upanishad, with the name of Maitreyi as the twenty-ninth; and\nagain, in the list of the sixteen Upanishads of the Sama-veda, we find\nMaitraya _n_ i and Maitreyi as the fourth and fifth.\n\nLooking at all this evidence, I think we should come to the conclusion that\nour Upanishad derives its name from the _S_ akha of the Maitraya _n_ as, and\nmay therefore be called Maitraya _n_ a-upanishad or Maitraya _n_ i Upanishad.\nMaitraya _n_ a-brahma _n_ a-upanishad seems likewise correct, and Maitraya _n_\ni-brahma _n_ a-upanishad, like Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a-upanishad and Va _g_\nasaneyi-sa _m_ hitopanishad, might be defended, if Maitrayanin were known as a\nfurther derivative of Maitraya _n_ a. If the name is formed from the teacher\nMaitri or Maitra, the title of Maitri-upanishad would also be correct, but I\ndoubt whether Maitri-upanishad would admit of any grammatical justification 3.\n\nBesides this Maitraya _n_ a-brahma _n_ a-upanishad, however, I possess a MS.\nof what is called the Maitreyopanishad, sent to me likewise by the late Dr.\nBurnell. It is very short, and contains no more than the substance of the\nfirst Prapa _th_ aka of the Maitraya _n_ a-brahma _n_ a-upanishad. I give\n\np. xlv\n\nthe text of it, as far as it can be restored from the one MS. in my\npossession:\n\nHari _h_ Om.

The title of Maitreyi-brahma _n_\na has, of course, a totally different origin, and simply means the Brahma _n_\na which tells the story of Maitreyi 15.\n\nAs Professor Cowell, in the Preface to his edition and translation of the\nMaitraya _n_ a-brahma _n_ a-upanishad, has discussed its peculiar character, I\nhave little to add on that subject. I agree with him in thinking that this\nUpanishad has grown, and contains several accretions. The Sanskrit commentator\nhimself declares the sixth and seventh chapters to be Khilas or supplementary.\nPossibly the Maitreya-upanishad, as printed above, contains the earliest\nframework. Then we have traces of various recensions. Professor Cowell\n(Preface, p. vi) mentions a MS., copied\n\np. xlvii\n\nfor Baron Eckstein, apparently from a Telugu original, which contains the\nfirst five chapters only, numbered as four. The verses given in VI, 34 (p.\n177), beginning with \'atreme _s_ loka bhavanti, are placed after IV, 3. In my\nown MS. these verses are inserted at the beginning of the fifth chapter 1.\nThen follows in Baron Eckstein\'s MS. as IV, 5, what is given in the printed\ntext as V, 1, 2 (pp. 69-76). In my own MS., which likewise comes from the\nSouth, the Upanishad does not go beyond VI, 8, which is called the sixth\nchapter and the end of the Upanishad.\n\nWe have in fact in our Upanishad the first specimen of that peculiar Indian\nstyle, so common in the later fables and stories, which delights in enclosing\none story within another. The kernel of our Upanishad is really the dialogue\nbetween the Valakhilyas and Pra _g_ apati Kratu. This is called by the\ncommentator (see p. 331, note) a Vyakhyana, i.e. a fuller explanation of the\nSutra which comes before, and which expresses in the few words, \'He is the\nSelf, this is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman,\' the gist of the\nwhole Upanishad.\n\nThis dialogue, or at all events the doctrine which it was meant to illustrate,\nwas communicated by Maitri (or Maitra) to _S_ akayanya, and by _S_ akayanya to\nKing B _ri_ hadratha Aikshvaka, also called Marut (II, 1; VI, 30). This\ndialogue might seem to come to an end in VI, 29, and likewise the dialogue\nbetween _S_ akayanya and B _ri_ hadratha; but it is carried on again to the\nend of VI, 30, and followed afterwards by a number of paragraphs which may\nprobably be considered as later additions.\n\nBut though admitting all this, I cannot bring myself to follow Professor\nCowell in considering, as he does, even the earlier portion of the Upanishad\nas dating from a late period, while the latter portions are called by him\ncomparatively modern, on account of frequent Vaish _n_ ava quotations. What\nimparts to this Upanishad, according to my opinion, an exceptionally genuine\nand ancient character, is the preservation in it of that peculiar Sandhi\nwhich,\n\np. xlviii\n\nthanks to the labours of Dr. von Schroeder, we now know to be characteristic\nof the Maitraya _n_ a- _s_ akha. In that _S_ akha final unaccented as and e\nare changed into a, if the next word begins with an accented vowel, except a.\nBefore initial a, however, e remains unchanged, and as becomes o, and the\ninitial a is sometimes elided, sometimes not. Some of these rules, it must be\nremembered, run counter to Pa _n_ ini, and we may safely conclude therefore\nthat texts in which they are observed, date from the time before Pa _n_ ini.\nIn some MSS., as, for instance, in my own MS. of the Maitraya _n_ a-brahma _n_\na-upanishad, these rules are not observed, but this makes their strict\nobservation in other MSS. all the more important. Besides, though to Dr. von\nSchroeder belongs, no doubt, the credit of having, in his edition of the\nMaitraya _n_ i Samhita, first pointed out these phonetic peculiarities, they\nwere known as such to the commentators, who expressly point out these\nirregular Sandhis as distinctive of the Maitraya _n_ i _s_ akha. Thus we read\nMaitr. Up. II, 3 (p. 18), that tigmate _g_ asa urdhvaretaso, instead of\ntigmate _g_ asa, is eva _m_ vidha eta _k_ _kh_ akhasa\xe1\xb9\x85ketapa _th_ as _kh_\nandasa _h_ sarvatra, i.e. is throughout the Vedic reading indicatory of that\nparticular _S_ akha, namely the Maitraya _n_ i.\n\nA still stranger peculiarity of our _S_ akha is the change of a final t before\ninitial _s_ into _\xc3\xb1_. This also occurs in our Upanishad. In VI, 8, we read _s_\nva _\xc3\xb1_ _s_ arirad; in VI, 2 7, ya _\xc3\xb1_ _s_ arirasya. Such a change seems\nphonetically so unnatural, that the tradition must have been very strong to\nperpetuate it among the Maitraya _n_ as.\n\nNow what is important for our purposes is this, that these phonetic\npeculiarities run through all the seven chapters of our Upanishad. This will\nbe seen from the following list:\n\nI. Final as changed into a before initial vowel 1:\n\nII, 3, tigmatega _s_ a urdhvaretaso (Comm. eta _k_ _kh_ akhasa\xe1\xb9\x85ketapa _th_ as\n_kh_ andasa _h_ sarvatra).\n\nII, 5, vibodha evam. II, 7, avasthita iti.\n\np. xlix\n\nIII, 5, etair abhibhuta iti. IV, i, vidyata iti.\n\nVI, 4, pra _n_ ava iti; bhamyadaya eko.\n\nVI, 6, aditya iti; ahavaniya iti; surya iti; aha\xe1\xb9\x85kara iti; vyana iti. VI, 7,\nbharga iti.\n\nVI, 7, sannivish _t_ a iti. VI, 23, deva o\xe1\xb9\x85karo.\n\nVI, 30, prayata iti. VI, 30, vinirgata iti.\n\nII. Final e before initial vowels becomes a. For instance:\n\nI, 4, d _ri_ _s_ yata iti. II, 2, nishpadyata iti.\n\nIII, 2, apadyata iti. III, 2, pushkara iti.\n\nIV, i, vidyata iti. VI, 10, bhu\xe1\xb9\x85kta iti.\n\nVI, 20, a _s_ nuta iti. VI, 30, eka ahur.\n\nEven prag _ri_ hya e is changed to a in--\n\nVI, 23, eta upasita, i.e. ete uktalaksha _n_ e brahma _n_ i.\n\nIn VI, 31, instead of te etasya, the commentator seems to have read te va\netasya.\n\nIII. Final as before a, u, and au becomes a, and is then contracted. For\ninstance:\n\nI, 4, vanaspatayodbhuta, instead of vanaspataya, udbhuta. (Comm. Sandhi _s_\n_kh_ andaso va, ukaro vatra lupto drash _t_ avya _h_.)\n\nII, 6, devaush _n_ yam, instead of deva aush _n_ yam. (Comm. Sandhi _s_ _kh_\nandasa _h_.)\n\nVI, 24, atamavish _t_ am, instead of atama-avish _t_ am (Comm. Sandhi _s_ _kh_\nandasa _h_ ); cf. Kha _n_ _d_. Up. VI, 8, 3, a _s_ anayeti (Comm. visar _g_\naniyalopa _h_ ).\n\nIV. Final e before i becomes a, and is then contracted. For instance:\n\nVI, 7, atma _g_ aniteti for _g_ anita iti. (Comm. _g_ anite, _g_ anati.)\n\nVI, 28, ava _t_ aiva for avata iva. (Comm. Sandhiv _ri_ ddhi _kh_ andase.)\n\nV. Final au before initial vowels becomes a. For instance:\n\nII, 6, yena va eta anug _ri_ hita iti.\n\nVI, 22, asa abhidhyata.\n\nOn abhibhuyamanay iva, see p. 295, note 2.\n\nV, 2, asa atma (var. lect. asav atma).\n\np. l\n\nVI. Final o of atho produces elision of initial short a. For instance:\n\nIII, 2, atho \'bhibhuatvat. (Comm. Sandhi _s_ _kh_ andasa _h_.) Various\nreading, ato \'bhibhutatvat.\n\nVI, 1, so antar is explained as sa u.\n\nVII. Other irregularities:\n\nVI, 7, apo pyayanat, explained by pyayanat and apyayanat. Might it be, apo \'py\nayanat?\n\nVI, 7, atmano tma neta.\n\nII, 6, so tmanam abhidhyatva.\n\nVI, 35, dvidharmondharn for dvidharmandham. (Comm. _kh_ andasa.)\n\nVI, 35, te _g_ asendham, i. e. tegasa-iddhan. (In explaining other irregular\ncompounds, too, as in I, 4, the commentator has recourse to a _kh_ andasa or\npramadika licence.)\n\nVI, 1, hira _n_ yavasthat for hira _n_ yavasthat. Here the dropping of a in\navasthat is explained by a reference to Bhaguri (vash _t_ i Bhagurir allopam\navapyor upasargayo _h_ ). See Vopadeva III, 171.\n\nVIII. Vi _s_ lish _t_ apatha:\n\nVII, 2, brahmadhiyalambana. (Comm. vi _s_ lish _t_ apatha _s_ _kh_ andasa\n_h_.)\n\nVI, 35, apyay a\xe1\xb9\x85kura for apy a\xe1\xb9\x85kura. (Comm. yakara _h_ pramadapa _th_ ita\n_h_.)\n\nOn the contrary VI, 35, vliyante for viliyante.\n\nIf on the grounds which we have hitherto. examined there seems good reason to\nascribe the Maitraya _n_ a-brahma _n_ a-upanishad to an early rather than to a\nlate period, possibly to an ante-Pa _n_ inean period, we shall hardly be\npersuaded to change this opinion on account of supposed references to\nVaishnava or to Bauddha doctrines which some scholars have tried to discover\nin it.\n\nAs to the worship of Vishnu, as one of the many manifestations of the Highest\nSpirit, we have seen it alluded to in other Upanishads, and we know from the\nBrahma _n_ as that the name of Vishnu was connected with many of the earliest\nVedic sacrifices.\n\np. li\n\nAs to Bauddha doctrines, including the very name of Nirva _n_ a (p. xlvi, l.\n19), we must remember, as I have often remarked, that there were Bauddhas\nbefore Buddha. B _ri_ haspati, who is frequently quoted in later philosophical\nwritings as the author of an heretical philosophy, denying the authority of\nthe Vedas, is mentioned by name in our Upanishad (VII, 9), but we are told\nthat this Brihaspati, having become Sukra, promulgated his erroneous doctrines\nin order to mislead the Asuras, and thus to insure the safety of Indra, i.e.\nof the old faith.\n\nThe fact that the teacher of King B _ri_ hadratha in our Upanishad is called\n_S_ akayanya, can never be used in support of the idea that, being a\ndescendant of _S_ aka 1, he must have been, like _S_ akyamuni, a teacher of\nBuddhist doctrines. He is the very opposite in our Upanishad, and warns his\nhearers against such doctrines as we should identify with the doctrines of\nBuddha. As I have pointed out on several occasions, the breaking through the\nlaw of the \xc3\x82sramas is the chief complaint which orthodox Brahmans make against\nBuddhists and their predecessors, and this is what _S_ akayanya condemns. A\nBrahman may become a Sannyasin, which is much the same as a Buddhist Bhikshu,\nif he has first passed through the three stages of a student, a householder,\nand a Vanaprastha. But to become a Bhikshu without that previous discipline,\nwas heresy in the eyes of the Brahmans, and it was exactly that heresy which\nthe Bauddhas preached and practised. That this social laxity was gaining\nground at the time when our Upanishad was written is clear (see VII, 8). We\nhear of people who wear red dresses (like the Buddhists) without having a\nright to them; we even hear of books, different from the Vedas, against which\nthe true Brahmans are warned. All this points to times when what we call\nBuddhism was in the air, say the sixth century B. C., the very time to which I\nhave always assigned the origin of the genuine and classical Upanishads. The\nUpanishads are to my mind the germs of Buddhism,\n\np. lii\n\nwhile Buddhism is in many respects the doctrine of the Upanishads carried out\nto its last consequences, and, what is important, employed as the foundation\nof a new social system. In doctrine the highest goal of the Vedanta, the\nknowledge of the true Self, is no more than the Buddhist Samyaksambodhi; in\npractice the Sannyasin is the Bhikshu, the friar, only emancipated alike from\nthe tedious discipline of the Brahmanic student, the duties of the Brahmanic\nhouseholder, and the yoke of useless penances imposed on the Brahmanic dweller\nin the forest. The spiritual freedom of the Sannyasin becomes in Buddhism the\ncommon property of the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85gha, the Fraternity, and that Fraternity is open\nalike to the young and the old, to the Brahman and the Sudra, to the rich and\nthe poor, to the wise and the foolish. In fact there is no break between the\nIndia of the Veda and the India of the Tripitaka, but there is an historical\ncontinuity between the two, and the connecting link between extremes that seem\nwidely separated must be sought in the Upanishads 1.\n\nF.
