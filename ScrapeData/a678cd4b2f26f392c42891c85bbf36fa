I meditate on the beginningless Brahmavidya who is Sarvachaitanyarupa, of\nthe nature of all-consciousness; May She stimulate our buddhi to the\nrealisation of That (or who stimulates our buddhi in different directions).\n\n\n\n2\\. S\xc2\x92aunaka said :-- \xc2\x93O highly fortunate Suta! O noble Suta! You are the best\nof persons; you are blessed inasmuch as you have thoroughly studied all the\nauspicious Pura _n_ as.\n\n\n\n3\\. O sinless one! you have gone through all the eighteen Pura _n_ as composed\nby Kri _sn_ a Dvaipayana; these are endowed with five excellent\ncharacteristics and full of esoteric meanings.\n\n\n\n_Note_ :-- The characteristics are to make the mantras reveal to one's own\nself, to realise, to transfer to others the S\xc2\x92akti, force thereof, to prove\nthe various manifestations of the several effects thereof, etc.\n\n\n\n4-5. O Sinless one! It is not that you have read them like a parrot, but you\nhave thoroughly grasped the meaning of them all as you have learnt them from\nVyasa himself, the son of Satyavati. Now it is our good merits that you have\ncome at this divine holy excellent Vis'vasan Ksettra (place), free from any\ndefects of the Kali age.\n\n\n\n6-10. O Suta! These Munis assembled here are desirous to hear the holy Pura\n_n_ a Samhita, that yields religious merits. So describe this to ns with your\nmind concentrated. O all-knowing Suta! Live long and be free from the\nthreefold sorrows of existence. O highly fortunate one! Narrate to us the Pura\n_n_ a equivalent to the Vedas. O Suta! Those persons that do not hear the Pura\n_n_ as, are certainly deprived by the Creator, though they have apparently the\norgan of hearing, of the power of tasting the sweet essence of words; because,\nthe organ of hearing is gratified then and then only when it hears the words\nof the wise men, just as the organ of taste is satisfied then and then only\nwhen it tastes the six kinds of rasas (flavour, taste) (sweet, sour, pungent,\nbitter, salty, and astringent). This is known to all. The serpents that are\nvoid of the organ of hearing are enchanted by sweet music; then why should not\nthose persons that have the organs of hearing and are averse to hear the Pura\n_n_ as, be thrown under the category of the deaf?\n\n\n\np. 2\n\n\n\n11-18. O Saumya! Hence all these Brahmi _n_ s, being distressed with the fear\nof this Kali, have come here to this Naimisara _n_ ya, eager to hear\nattentively the Pura _n_ as, and are staying here with this one object. Time\nmust be spent away anyhow or other; those that are fools while away their\ntimes in sports and other evil practices and those that are learned pass away\ntheir times in meditating on the S\xc2\x92astras; but these S\xc2\x92astras are too vast and\nvery varied; they contain Jalpas (debates or wrangling discussions to win over\nthe opposite party), Vadas (sound doctrines to arrive at just conclusions),\nand various Arthavadas (explanations and assertions, recommending Vidhis or\nprecepts by stating the good arising from its proper observance and evils\narising from its omission and also by adducing historical instances for its\nsupport; praises and eulogies) and filled with many argumentations. And,\namongst these S\xc2\x92astras again, the Vedanta is the Sattvik, the Mimamsas are the\nRajasik and the Nyaya S\xc2\x92astras with Hetuvadas, are the Tamasik; so the\nS\xc2\x92astras are varied. Similarly, the Pura _n_ as are of three kinds :-- (1)\nS\xc2\x92attvik, (2) Rajasik and (3) Tamasik. O Saumya! (one of gentle appearance)\nyou have recited those Pura _n_ as endowed with five characteristics and full\nof many narratives; of these, the fifth Pura _n_ a, equivalent to the Vedas\nand with all the good qualities, the Bhagavata yields Dharma and Kama\n(religion and desires), gives liberation to those who desire for emancipation\nand is very wonderful; you mentioned this before but ordinarily; you did not\ndwell on this specially. Now these Brahma _n_ as are eager to hear gladly this\ndivine auspicious Bhagavata, the best of the Pura _n_ as; so kindly describe\nthis in detail.\n\n\n\n19-25. O knower of Dharma! By your faith and devotion to your Guru, you have\nbecome Sattvik and thus have thoroughly known the Pura _n_ a Samhitas spoken\nby Veda Vyas. O Omniscient one! Therefore it is that we have heard many Pura\n_n_ as from your mouth; but we are not satisfied as the Devas are not\nsatisfied with the drinking of the nectar. O Suta! Fie to the nectar even as\nthe drinking of nectar is quite useless in giving Mukti. But hearing the\nBhagavata gives instantaneous Mukti from this Samsara or round of birth and\ndeath. O Suta! we performed thousands and thousands of Yaj\xc3\xb1as for the drinking\nof the nectar (Amrita), but never we got the full peace. The reason being that\nYaj\xc3\xb1as lead to heaven only; on the expiry of the period of punya (good merits,\nthe heavenly life ceases and one is expelled, as it were from the Heavens.\nThus incessant sojourns in this wheel of Samsara, the constant rounds of\nbirths and deaths never end. O Knower of every thing! Thus, without J\xc3\xb1ana\n(knowledge, wisdom) Mukti never comes to men, wandering in this wheel of Time\n(Kalachakra) composed\n\n\n\np. 3\n\n\n\nof the three Gu _n_ as. So describe this holy Bhagavata, always beloved of the\nMumuk _s_ as (those that desire Mukti), this secret work yielding liberation,\nholy and full of all sentiments (rasas).\n\n\n\nThus ends the first chapter of the first Skandha on the questioning about the\nPura _n_ a by Saunaka and other Rishis in the Mahapurana S\xc2\x92rimad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\nHere ends the First Chapter of the First Skandha of S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam on\nthe questions by S\xc2\x92aunaka and other Risis.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk01ch02.htm)\n\n"
