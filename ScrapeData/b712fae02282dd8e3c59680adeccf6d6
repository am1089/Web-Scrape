There I have to\nacknowledge the rule of universal law. That is where the foundation of my\nexistence lies, deep down below. Its strength lies in its being held firm in\nthe clasp of comprehensive world, and in the fullness of its community with\nall things.\n\nBut at the other pole of my being I am separate from all. There I have broken\nthrough the cordon of equality and stand alone as an individual. I am\nabsolutely unique, I am I, I am incomparable. The whole weight of the universe\ncannot crush out this individuality of mine. I maintain it in spite of the\ntremendous gravitation of all things. It is small in appearance but great in\nreality. For it holds its own against the forces that would rob it of its\ndistinction and make it one with the dust.\n\nThis is the superstructure of the self which rises from the indeterminate\ndepth and darkness of its foundation into the open, proud of its isolation,\nproud of having given shape to a single individual idea of the architect\'s\nwhich has no duplicate in the whole universe. If this individuality be\ndemolished, then though no material be lost, not an atom destroyed, the\ncreative joy which was crystallised therein is gone. We are absolutely\nbankrupt if we are deprived of this specialty, this individuality, which is\nthe only thing we can call our own; and which, if lost, is also a loss to the\nwhole world. It is most valuable because it is not universal. And therefore\nonly through it can we gain the universe more truly than if we were lying\nwithin its breast unconscious of our distinctiveness. The universal is ever\nseeking its consummation in the unique. And the desire we have to keep our\nuniqueness intact is really the desire of the universe acting in us. It is our\njoy of the infinite in us that gives us our joy in ourselves.\n\nThat this separateness of self is considered by man as his most precious\npossession is proved by the sufferings he undergoes and the sins he commits\nfor its sake. But the consciousness of separation has come from the eating of\nthe fruit of knowledge. It has led man to shame and crime and death; yet it is\ndearer to him than any paradise where the self lies, securely slumbering in\nperfect innocence in the womb of mother nature.\n\nIt is a constant striving and suffering for us to maintain the separateness of\nthis self of ours. And in fact it is this suffering which measures its value.\nOne side of the value is sacrifice, which represents how much the cost has\nbeen. The other side of it is the attainment, which represents how much has\nbeen gained. If the self meant nothing to us but pain and sacrifice, it could\nhave no value for us, and on no account would we willingly undergo such\nsacrifice. In such case there could be no doubt at all that the highest object\nof humanity would be the annihilation of self.\n\nBut if there is a corresponding gain, if it does not end in a void but in a\nfullness, then it is clear that its negative qualities, its very sufferings\nand sacrifices, make it all the more precious. That it is so has been proved\nby those who have realised the positive significance of self, and have\naccepted its responsibilities with eagerness and undergone sacrifices without\nflinching.\n\nWith the foregoing introduction it will be easy for me to answer the question\nonce asked by one of my audience as to whether the annihilation of self has\nnot been held by India as the supreme goal of humanity?\n\nIn the first place we must keep in mind the fact that man is never literal in\nthe expression of his ideas, except in matters most trivial. Very often man\'s\nwords are not a language at all, but merely a vocal gesture of the dumb. They\nmay indicate, but do not express his thoughts. The more vital his thoughts the\nmore have his words to be explained by the context of his life. Those who seek\nto know his meaning by the aid of the dictionary only technically reach the\nhouse, for they are stopped by the outside wall and find no entrance to the\nhall. This is the reason why the teachings of our greatest prophets give rise\nto endless disputations when we try to understand them by following their\nwords and not be realising them in our own lives. The men who are cursed with\nthe gift of the literal mind are the unfortunate ones who are always busy with\ntheir nets and neglect the fishing.\n\nIt is not only in Buddhism and the Indian religions, but in Christianity too,\nthat the ideal of selflessness is preached with all fervour. In the last the\nsymbol of death has been used for expressing the idea of man\'s deliverance\nfrom the life which is not true. This is the same as Nirvn\xc4\x81na, the symbol of\nthe extinction of the lamp.\n\nIn the typical thought of India it is held that the true deliverance of man is\nthe deliverance from _avidy \xc4\x81_, from ignorance. It is not in destroying\nanything that is positive and real, for that cannot be possible, but that\nwhich is negative, which obstructs our vision of truth. When this obstruction,\nwhich is ignorance, is removed, then only is the eyelid drawn up which is no\nloss to the eye.\n\nIt is our ignorance which makes us think that our self, as self, is real, that\nit has its complete meaning in itself. When we take that wrong view of self\nthen we try to live in such a manner as to make self the ultimate object of\nour life. Then we are doomed to disappointment like the man who tries to reach\nhis destination by firmly clutching the dust of the road. Our self has no\nmeans of holding us, for its own nature is to pass on; and by clinging to this\nthread of self which is passing through the loom of life we cannot make it\nserve the purpose of the cloth into which it is being woven. When a man, with\nelaborate care, arranges for an enjoyment of the self, he lights a fire but\nhas no dough to make his bread with; the fire flares up and consumes itself to\nextinction, like an unnatural beast that eats its own progeny and dies.\n\nIn an unknown language the words are tyrannically prominent. They stop us but\nsay nothing. To be rescued from this fetter of words we must rid ourselves of\nthe _avidy \xc4\x81_, our ignorance, and then our mind will find its freedom in the\ninner idea. But it would be foolish to say that our ignorance of the language\ncan be dispelled only by the destruction of the words. No, when the perfect\nknowledge comes, every word remains in its place, only they do not bind us to\nthemselves, but let us pass through them and lead us to the idea which is\nemancipation.\n\nThus it is only _avidy \xc4\x81_ which makes the self our fetter by making us think\nthat it is an end in itself, and by preventing our seeing that it contains the\nidea that transcends its limits. That is why the wise man comes and says, "Set\nyourselves free from the _avidy \xc4\x81_; know your true soul and be saved from the\ngrasp of the self which imprisons you."\n\nWe gain our freedom when we attain our truest nature. The man who is an artist\nfinds his artistic freedom when he finds his ideal of art. Then is he freed\nfrom laborious attempts at imitation, from the goadings of popular\napprobation. It is the function of religion not to destroy our nature but to\nfulfil it.\n\nThe Sanskrit word _dharma_ which is usually translated into English as\nreligion has a deeper meaning in our language. _Dharma_ is the innermost\nnature, the essence, the implicit truth, of all things. _Dharma_ is the\nultimate purpose that is working in our self. When any wrong is done we say\nthat _dharma_ is violated, meaning that the lie has been given to our true\nnature.\n\nBut this _dharma_ , which is the truth in us, is not apparent, because it is\ninherent. So much so, that it has been held that sinfulness is the nature of\nman, and only by the special grace of God can a particular person be saved.\nThis is like saying that the nature of the seed is to remain enfolded within\nits shell, and it is only by some special miracle that it can be grown into a\ntree. But do we not know that the _appearance_ of the seed contradicts its\ntrue nature? When you submit it to chemical analysis you may find in it carbon\nand proteid and a good many other things, but not the idea of a branching\ntree. Only when the tree begins to take shape do you come to see its _dharma_\n, and then you can affirm without doubt that the seed which has been wasted\nand allowed to rot in the ground has been thwarted in its _dharma_ , in the\nfulfilment of its true nature. In the history of humanity we have known the\nliving seed in us to sprout. We have seen the great purpose in us taking shape\nin the lives of our greatest men, and have felt certain that though there are\nnumerous individual lives that seem ineffectual, still it is not their\n_dharma_ to remain barren; but it is for them to burst their cover and\ntransform themselves into a vigorous spiritual shoot, growing up into the air\nand light, and branching out in all directions.\n\nThe freedom of the seed is in the attainment of its _dharma_ , its nature and\ndestiny of becoming a tree; it is the non-accomplishment which is its prison.\nThe sacrifice by which a thing attains its fulfilment is not a sacrifice which\nends in death; it is the casting-off of bonds which wins freedom.\n\nWhen we know the highest ideal of freedom which a man has, we know his\n_dharma_ , the essence of his nature, the real meaning of his self. At first\nsight it seems that man counts that as freedom by which he gets unbounded\nopportunities of self gratification and self-aggrandisement. But surely this\nis not borne out by history. Our revelatory men have always been those who\nhave lived the life of self-sacrifice. The higher nature in man always seeks\nfor something which transcends itself and yet is its deepest truth; which\nclaims all its sacrifice, yet makes this sacrifice its own recompense. This is\nman\'s _dharma_ , man\'s religion, and man\'s self is the vessel which is to\ncarry this sacrifice to the altar.\n\nWe can look at our self in its two different aspects. The self which displays\nitself, and the self which transcends itself and thereby reveals its own\nmeaning. To display itself it tries to be big, to stand upon the pedestal of\nits accumulations, and to retain everything to itself. To reveal itself it\ngives up everything it has; thus becoming perfect like a flower that has\nblossomed out from the bud, pouring from its chalice of beauty all its\nsweetness.\n\nThe lamp contains its oil, which it holds securely in its close grasp and\nguards from the least loss. Thus is it separate from all other objects around\nit and is miserly. But when lighted it finds its meaning at once; its relation\nwith all things far and near is established, and it freely sacrifices its fund\nof oil to feed the flame.\n\nSuch a lamp is our self. So long as it hoards its possessions it keeps itself\ndark, its conduct contradicts its true purpose. When it finds illumination it\nforgets itself in a moment, holds the light high, and serves it with\neverything it has; for therein is its revelation. This revelation is the\nfreedom which Buddha preached. He asked the lamp to give up its oil. But\npurposeless giving up is a still darker poverty which he never could have\nmeant. The lamp must give up its oil to the light and thus set free the\npurpose it has in its hoarding. This is emancipation. The path Buddha pointed\nout was not merely the practice of self- abnegation, but the widening of love.\nAnd therein lies the true meaning of Buddha\'s preaching.\n\nWhen we find that the state of _Nirv \xc4\x81na_ preached by Buddha is through love,\nthen we know for certain that _Nirv \xc4\x81na_ is the highest culmination of love.\nFor love is an end unto itself. Everything else raises the question "Why?" in\nour mind, and we require a reason for it. But when we say, "I love," then\nthere is no room for the "why"; it is the final answer in itself.\n\nDoubtless, even selfishness impels one to give away. But the selfish man does\nit on compulsion. That is like plucking fruit when it is unripe; you have to\ntear it from the tree and bruise the branch. But when a man loves, giving\nbecomes a matter of joy to him, like the tree\'s surrender of the ripe fruit.\nAll our belongings assume a weight by the ceaseless gravitation of our selfish\ndesires; we cannot easily cast them away from us. They seem to belong to our\nvery nature, to stick to us as a second skin, and we bleed as we detach them.\nBut when we are possessed by love, its force acts in the opposite direction.\nThe things that closely adhered to us lose their adhesion and weight, and we\nfind that they are not of us. Far from being a loss to give them away, we find\nin that the fulfilment of our being.\n\nThus we find in perfect love the freedom of our self. That only which is done\nfor love is done freely, however much pain it may cause. Therefore working for\nlove is freedom in action. This is the meaning of the teaching of\ndisinterested work in the _G \xc4\xabta_.\n\nThe _G \xc4\xabta_ says action we must have, for only in action do we manifest our\nnature. But this manifestation is not perfect so long as our action is not\nfree. In fact, our nature is obscured by work done by the compulsion of want\nor fear. The mother reveals herself in the service of her children, so our\ntrue freedom is not the freedom _from_ action but freedom _in_ action, which\ncan only be attained in the work of love.\n\nGod\'s manifestation is in his work of creation and it is said in the\nUpanishad, _Knowledge, power, and action are of his nature_  35 ; they are not\nimposed upon him from outside. Therefore his work is his freedom, and in his\ncreation he realises himself. The same thing is said elsewhere in other words:\n_From joy does spring all this creation, by joy is it maintained, towards joy\ndoes it progress, and into joy does it enter_.  36 It means that God\'s\ncreation has not its source in any necessity; it comes from his fullness of\njoy; it is his love that creates, therefore in creation is his own revealment.\n\nThe artist who has a joy in the fullness of his artistic idea objectifies it\nand thus gains it more fully by holding it afar. It is joy which detaches\nourselves from us, and then gives it form in creations of love in order to\nmake it more perfectly our own. Hence there must be this separation, not a\nseparation of repulsion but a separation of love. Repulsion has only the one\nelement, the element of severance. But love has two, the element of severance,\nwhich is only an appearance, and the element of union which is the ultimate\ntruth. Just as when the father tosses his child up from his arms it has the\nappearance of rejection but its truth is quite the reverse.\n\nSo we must know that the meaning of our self is not to be found in its\nseparateness from God and others, but in the ceaseless realisation of _yoga_ ,\nof union; not on the side of the canvas where it is blank, but on the side\nwhere the picture is being painted.\n\nThis is the reason why the separateness of our self has been described by our\nphilosophers as _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_, as an illusion, because it has no intrinsic reality\nof its own. It looks perilous; it raises its isolation to a giddy height and\ncasts a black shadow upon the fair face of existence; from the outside it has\nan aspect of a sudden disruption, rebellious and destructive; it is proud,\ndomineering and wayward; it is ready to rob the world of all its wealth to\ngratify its craving of a moment; to pluck with a reckless, cruel hand all the\nplumes from the divine bird of beauty to deck its ugliness for a day; indeed\nman\'s legend has it that it bears the black mark of disobedience stamped on\nits forehead for ever; but still all this _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_, envelopment of _avidy \xc4\x81_;\nit is the mist, it is not the sun; it is the black smoke that presages the\nfire of love.\n\nImagine some savage who, in his ignorance, thinks that it is the paper of the\nbanknote that has the magic, by virtue of which the possessor of it gets all\nhe wants. He piles up the papers, hides them, handles them in all sorts of\nabsurd ways, and then at last, wearied by his efforts, comes to the sad\nconclusion that they are absolutely worthless, only fit to be thrown into the\nfire. But the wise man knows that the paper of the banknote is all _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_,\nand until it is given up to the bank it is futile. It is only _avidy \xc4\x81_, our\nignorance, that makes us believe that the separateness of our self like the\npaper of the banknote is precious in itself, and by acting on this belief our\nself is rendered valueless. It is only when the _avidy \xc4\x81_ is removed that this\nvery self comes to us with a wealth which is priceless. For _He manifests\nHimself in forms which His joy assumes_.  37 These forms are separate from\nHim, and the value that these forms have is only what his joy has imparted to\nthem. When we transfer back these forms into that original joy, which is love,\nthen we cash them in the bank and we find their truth.\n\nWhen pure necessity drives man to his work it takes an accidental and\ncontingent character, it becomes a mere makeshift arrangement; it is deserted\nand left in ruins when necessity changes its course. But when his work is the\noutcome of joy, the forms that it takes have the elements of immortality. The\nimmortal in man imparts to it its own quality of permanence.\n\nOur self, as a form of God\'s joy, is deathless. For his joy is _amritham_ ,\neternal. This it is in us which makes us sceptical of death, even when the\nfact of death cannot be doubted. In reconcilement of this contradiction in us\nwe come to the truth that in the dualism of death and life there is a harmony.\nWe know that the life of a soul, which is finite in its expression and\ninfinite in its principle, must go through the portals of death in its journey\nto realise the infinite. It is death which is monistic, it has no life in it.\nBut life is dualistic; it has an appearance as well as truth; and death is\nthat appearance, that _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_, which is an inseparable companion to life. Our\nself to live must go through a continual change and growth of form, which may\nbe termed a continual death and a continual life going on at the same time. It\nis really courting death when we refuse to accept death; when we wish to give\nthe form of the self some fixed changelessness; when the self feels no impulse\nwhich urges it to grow out of itself; when it treats its limits as final and\nacts accordingly. Then comes our teacher\'s call to die to this death; not a\ncall to annihilation but to eternal life. It is the extinction of the lamp in\nthe morning light; not the abolition of the sun. It is really asking us\nconsciously to give effect to the innermost wish that we have in the depths of\nour nature.\n\nWe have a dual set of desires in our being, which it should be our endeavour\nto bring into a harmony. In the region of our physical nature we have one set\nof which we are conscious always. We wish to enjoy our food and drink, we\nhanker after bodily pleasure and comfort. These desires are self-centered;\nthey are solely concerned with their respective impulses. The wishes of our\npalate often run counter to what our stomach can allow.\n\nBut we have another set, which is the desire of our physical system as a\nwhole, of which we are usually unconscious. It is the wish for health. This is\nalways doing its work, mending and repairing, making new adjustments in cases\nof accident, and skilfully restoring the balance wherever disturbed. It has no\nconcern with the fulfilment of our immediate bodily desires, but it goes\nbeyond the present time. It is the principle of our physical wholeness, it\nlinks our life with its past and its future and maintains the unity of its\nparts. He who is wise knows it, and makes his other physical wishes harmonise\nwith it.\n\nWe have a greater body which is the social body. Society is an organism, of\nwhich we as parts have our individual wishes. We want our own pleasure and\nlicense. We want to pay less and gain more than anybody else. This causes\nscramblings and fights. But there is that other wish in us which does its work\nin the depths of the social being. It is the wish for the welfare of the\nsociety. It transcends the limits of the present and the personal. It is on\nthe side of the infinite.\n\nHe who is wise tries to harmonise the wishes that seek for self- gratification\nwith the wish for the social good, and only thus can he realise his higher\nself.\n\nIn its finite aspect the self is conscious of its separateness, and there it\nis ruthless in its attempt to have more distinction than all others. But in\nits infinite aspect its wish is to gain that harmony which leads to its\nperfection and not its mere aggrandisement.\n\nThe emancipation of our physical nature is in attaining health, of our social\nbeing in attaining goodness, and of our self in attaining love. This last is\nwhat Buddha describes as extinction--the extinction of selfishness--which is\nthe function of love, and which does not lead to darkness but to illumination.\nThis is the attainment of _bodhi_ , or the true awakening; it is the revealing\nin us of the infinite joy by the light of love.\n\nThe passage of our self is through its selfhood, which is independent, to its\nattainment of soul, which is harmonious. This harmony can never be reached\nthrough compulsion. So our will, in the history of its growth, must come\nthrough independence and rebellion to the ultimate completion. We must have\nthe possibility of the negative form of freedom, which is licence, before we\ncan attain the positive freedom, which is love.\n\nThis negative freedom, the freedom of self-will, can turn its back upon its\nhighest realisation, but it cannot cut itself away from it altogether, for\nthen it will lose its own meaning. Our self-will has freedom up to a certain\nextent; it can know what it is to break away from the path, but it cannot\ncontinue in that direction indefinitely. For we are finite on our negative\nside. We must come to an end in our evil doing, in our career of discord. For\nevil is not infinite, and discord cannot be an end in itself. Our will has\nfreedom in order that it may find out that its true course is towards goodness\nand love. For goodness and love are infinite, and only in the infinite is the\nperfect realisation of freedom possible. So our will can be free not towards\nthe limitations of our self, not where it is _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ and negation, but towards\nthe unlimited, where is truth and love. Our freedom cannot go against its own\nprinciple of freedom and yet be free; it cannot commit suicide and yet live.\nWe cannot say that we should have infinite freedom to fetter ourselves, for\nthe fettering ends the freedom.\n\nSo in the freedom of our will, we have the same dualism of appearance and\ntruth--our self-will is only the appearance of freedom and love is the truth.\nWhen we try to make this appearance independent of truth, then our attempt\nbrings misery and proves its own futility in the end. Everything has this\ndualism of _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ and _satyam_ , appearance and truth. Words are _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_\nwhere they are merely sounds and finite, they are _satyam_ where they are\nideas and infinite. Our self is _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ where it is merely individual and\nfinite, where it considers its separateness as absolute; it is _satyam_ where\nit recognises its essence in the universal and infinite, in the supreme self,\nin _param \xc4\x81tman_. This is what Christ means when he says, "Before Abraham was\nI am." This is the eternal _I am_ that speaks through the _I am_ that is in\nme. The individual _I am_ attains its perfect end when it realises its freedom\nof harmony in the infinite _I am_. Then is it _mukti_ , its deliverance from\nthe thraldom of _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_, of appearance, which springs from _avidy \xc4\x81_, from\nignorance; its emancipation in _\xc3\xa7 \xc4\x81ntam \xc3\xa7ivam advaitam_, in the perfect repose\nin truth, in the perfect activity in goodness, and in the perfect union in\nlove.\n\nNot only in our self but also in nature is there this separateness from God,\nwhich has been described as _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ by our philosophers, because the\nseparateness does not exist by itself, it does not limit God\'s infinity from\noutside. It is his own will that has imposed limits to itself, just as the\nchess-player restricts his will with regard to the moving of the chessmen. The\nplayer willingly enters into definite relations with each particular piece and\nrealises the joy of his power by these very restrictions. It is not that he\ncannot move the chessmen just as he pleases, but if he does so then there can\nbe no play. If God assumes his role of omnipotence, then his creation is at an\nend and his power loses all its meaning. For power to be a power must act\nwithin limits. God\'s water must be water, his earth can never be other than\nearth. The law that has made them water and earth is his own law by which he\nhas separated the play from the player, for therein the joy of the player\nconsists.\n\nAs by the limits of law nature is separated from God, so it is the limits of\nits egoism which separates the self from him. He has willingly set limits to\nhis will, and has given us mastery over the little world of our own. It is\nlike a father\'s settling upon his son some allowance within the limit of which\nhe is free to do what he likes. Though it remains a portion of the father\'s\nown property, yet he frees it from the operation of his own will. The reason\nof it is that the will, which is love\'s will and therefore free, can have its\njoy only in a union with another free will. The tyrant who must have slaves\nlooks upon them as instruments of his purpose. It is the consciousness of his\nown necessity which makes him crush the will out of them, to make his self-\ninterest absolutely secure. This self-interest cannot brook the least freedom\nin others, because it is not itself free. The tyrant is really dependent on\nhis slaves, and therefore he tries to make them completely useful by making\nthem subservient to his own will. But a lover must have two wills for the\nrealisation of his love, because the consummation of love is in harmony, the\nharmony between freedom and freedom. So God\'s love from which our self has\ntaken form has made it separate from God; and it is God\'s love which again\nestablishes a reconciliation and unites God with our self through the\nseparation. That is why our self has to go through endless renewals. For in\nits career of separateness it cannot go on for ever. Separateness is the\nfinitude where it finds its barriers to come back again and again to its\ninfinite source. Our self has ceaselessly to cast off its age, repeatedly shed\nits limits in oblivion and death, in order to realise its immortal youth. Its\npersonality must merge in the universal time after time, in fact pass through\nit every moment, ever to refresh its individual life. It must follow the\neternal rhythm and touch the fundamental unity at every step, and thus\nmaintain its separation balanced in beauty and strength.\n\nThe play of life and death we see everywhere--this transmutation of the old\ninto the new. The day comes to us every morning, naked and white, fresh as a\nflower. But we know it is old. It is age itself. It is that very ancient day\nwhich took up the newborn earth in its arms, covered it with its white mantle\nof light, and sent it forth on its pilgrimage among the stars.\n\nYet its feet are untired and its eyes undimmed. It carries the golden amulet\nof ageless eternity, at whose touch all wrinkles vanish from the forehead of\ncreation. In the very core of the world\'s heart stands immortal youth. Death\nand decay cast over its face momentary shadows and pass on; they leave no\nmarks of their steps--and truth remains fresh and young.\n\nThis old, old day of our earth is born again and again every morning. It comes\nback to the original refrain of its music. If its march were the march of an\ninfinite straight line, if it had not the awful pause of its plunge in the\nabysmal darkness and its repeated rebirth in the life of the endless\nbeginning, then it would gradually soil and bury truth with its dust and\nspread ceaseless aching over the earth under its heavy tread. Then every\nmoment would leave its load of weariness behind, and decrepitude would reign\nsupreme on its throne of eternal dirt.\n\nBut every morning the day is reborn among the newly-blossomed flowers with the\nsame message retold and the same assurance renewed that death eternally dies,\nthat the waves of turmoil are on the surface, and that the sea of tranquillity\nis fathomless. The curtain of night is drawn aside and truth emerges without a\nspeck of dust on its garment, without a furrow of age on its lineaments.\n\nWe see that he who is before everything else is the same to-day. Every note of\nthe song of creation comes fresh from his voice. The universe is not a mere\necho, reverberating from sky to sky, like a homeless wanderer--the echo of an\nold song sung once for all in the dim beginning of things and then left\norphaned. Every moment it comes from the heart of the master, it is breathed\nin his breath.\n\nAnd that is the reason why it overspreads the sky like a thought taking shape\nin a poem, and never has to break into pieces with the burden of its own\naccumulating weight. Hence the surprise of endless variations, the advent of\nthe unaccountable, the ceaseless procession of individuals, each of whom is\nwithout a parallel in creation. As at the first so to the last, the beginning\nnever ends--the world is ever old and ever new.\n\nIt is for our self to know that it must be born anew every moment of its life.\nIt must break through all illusions that encase it in their crust to make it\nappear old, burdening it with death.\n\nFor life is immortal youthfulness, and it hates age that tries to clog its\nmovements--age that belongs not to life in truth, but follows it as the shadow\nfollows the lamp.\n\nOur life, like a river, strikes its banks not to find itself closed in by\nthem, but to realise anew every moment that it has its unending opening\ntowards the sea. It is a poem that strikes its metre at every step not to be\nsilenced by its rigid regulations, but to give expression every moment to the\ninner freedom of its harmony.\n\nThe boundary walls of our individuality thrust us back within our limits, on\nthe one hand, and thus lead us, on the other, to the unlimited. Only when we\ntry to make these limits infinite are we launched into an impossible\ncontradiction and court miserable failure.\n\nThis is the cause which leads to the great revolutions in human history.\nWhenever the part, spurning the whole, tries to run a separate course of its\nown, the great pull of the all gives it a violent wrench, stops it suddenly,\nand brings it to the dust. Whenever the individual tries to dam the ever-\nflowing current of the world-force and imprison it within the area of his\nparticular use, it brings on disaster. However powerful a king may be, he\ncannot raise his standard or rebellion against the infinite source of\nstrength, which is unity, and yet remain powerful.\n\nIt has been said, _By unrighteousness men prosper, gain what they desire, and\ntriumph over their enemies, but at the end they are cut off at the root and\nsuffer extinction._  38 Our roots must go deep down into the universal if we\nwould attain the greatness of personality.\n\nIt is the end of our self to seek that union. It must bend its head low in\nlove and meekness and take its stand where great and small all meet. It has to\ngain by its loss and rise by its surrender. His games would be a horror to the\nchild if he could not come back to his mother, and our pride of personality\nwill be a curse to us if we cannot give it up in love. We must know that it is\nonly the revelation of the Infinite which is endlessly new and eternally\nbeautiful in us, and which gives the only meaning to our self.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[35](sadh06.htm#fr_34) "Sv\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81vik\xc4\xab jn\xc4\x81na bala kriy\xc4\x81cha."\n\n[36](sadh06.htm#fr_35) \xc4\x80nand\xc4\x81dhy\xc4\x93va khalvim\xc4\x81ni bh\xc5\xabt\xc4\x81ni j\xc4\x81yant\xc4\x93, \xc4\x81nand\xc4\x93na\nj\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81ni j\xc4\xabvanti, \xc4\x81nandamprayantyabhisamvi\xc3\xa7anti.\n\n[37](sadh06.htm#fr_36) \xc4\x80nandar\xc5\xabpamamritam yadvibh\xc4\x81ti.\n\n[38](sadh06.htm#fr_37) Adharm\xc4\x93naidhat\xc4\x93 t\xc4\x81vat tat\xc5\x8d bahdr\xc4\x81\xc5\x86i pa\xc3\xa7yati tatah\nsapatn\xc4\x81n jayati sam\xc5\xablastu vina\xc3\xa7yati.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V: Realisation in Love](sadh07.htm)\n\n'
