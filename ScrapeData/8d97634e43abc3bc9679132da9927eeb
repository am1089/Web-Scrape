Then, when the king put the body with the goblin in it on his\nshoulder and started to carry him off quickly and silently, the goblin on his\nshoulder said to him: "Oh King, you have fallen into a very disagreeable task\nwhich you do not deserve. So to amuse you I will tell another story. Listen."\n\n\n\nOn the bank of Kalindi River is a farm where a very learned Brahman lived. And\nhe had a very beautiful daughter named Coral. When the Creator fashioned her\nfresh and peerless loveliness, surely he must have despised the cleverness he\nshowed before in fashioning the nymphs of heaven.\n\nWhen she had grown out of childhood, there came from the city of Kanauj three\nBrahman youths, endowed with all the virtues. And each of them asked her\nfather for her, that she might be his own. And though her father would rather\nhave died than give her up to anyone, he made up his mind to give her to one\nof them. But the girl would not marry any one of them for some time, because\nshe was afraid of hurting the feelings of the other two. So they stayed there\nall three of them day and night, feasting on the beauty of her face, like the\nbirds that live on moonbeams.\n\nThen all at once Coral fell sick of a burning fever and died. And when the\nBrahman youths saw that she was dead, they were smitten with grief. But they\nadorned her body, took it to the cemetery, and burned it.\n\nAnd one of them built a hut there, slept on a bed made of her ashes, and got\nhis food by begging. The second took her bones and went to dip them in the\nsacred Ganges river. And the third became a monk and wandered in other\ncountries.\n\nAnd as he wandered, the monk came to a village called Thunderbolt, and was\nentertained in the house of a Brahman. But when he had been honoured by the\nmaster of the house and had begun to eat dinner there, the little boy began to\ncry and would not stop even when they petted him. So his mother took him on\nher arm, and angrily threw him into the blazing fire. And being tender, he was\nreduced to ashes in a moment.\n\nWhen the monk saw this, his hair stood on end, and he said: "Alas! I have come\ninto the house of a devil. I will not eat this food. It would be like eating\nsin." But the master of the house said to him: "Brahman, I have studied to\ngood purpose. See my skill in bringing the dead to life." So he opened a book,\ntook out a magic spell, read it, and sprinkled water on the ashes. And the\nmoment the water was sprinkled, the boy stood up alive just as before. Then\nthe monk was highly delighted and finished his dinner with pleasure.\n\nAnd the master of the house hung the book on an ivory peg, took dinner with\nthe monk, and went to bed. When he was asleep, the monk got up quietly, and\ntremblingly took the book, hoping to bring his darling Coral back to life. He\nwent away and travelled night and day, until he finally reached the cemetery.\nAnd he caught sight of the second youth, who had come back after dipping the\nbones in the Ganges. And he also found the third youth, who had made a hut and\nlived there, sleeping on the girl\'s ashes.\n\nThen the monk cried: "Brother, leave your hut. I will bring the dear girl back\nto life." And while they eagerly questioned him, he opened the book, and read\nthe magic spell, and sprinkled holy water on the ashes. And Coral immediately\nstood up, alive. And the girl was more beautiful than ever. She looked as if\nshe were made of gold.\n\nWhen the three youths saw her come back to life like that, they went mad with\nlove, and fought with one another to possess her.\n\nOne said: "I brought her to life by my magic spell. She is my wife."\n\nThe second said: "She came to life because of my journey to the sacred river.\nShe is my wife."\n\nThe third said: "I kept her ashes. That is why she came to life. She is my\ndear wife."\n\n\n\nO King, you are able to decide their dispute. Tell me. Whose wife should she\nbe? If you know and say what is false, then your head will split.\n\nWhen the king heard this, he said to the goblin: "The man who painfully found\nthe magic spell and brought her back to life, he did only what a father ought\nto do. He is not her husband. And the man who went to dip her bones in the\nsacred river, he did only what a son ought to do. He is not her husband. But\nthe man who slept with her ashes and lived a hard life in the cemetery, he did\nwhat a lover ought to do. He deserves to be her husband."\n\nWhen the goblin heard this answer of King Triple-victory, he suddenly escaped\nfrom his shoulder and went back. And the king wished to do as the monk had\nasked him; so he decided to go back and get him. Great-minded people do not\nwaver until they have kept their promises, even at the cost of life.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Third Goblin: The Parrot and the Thrush.
