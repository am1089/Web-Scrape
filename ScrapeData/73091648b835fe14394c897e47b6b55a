Vyasa said :-- O king! The Dharma's son, of excellent prowess, hearing\nthus, the words of these damsels, thought within himself, thus :-- what shall\nI do under the above circumstances.\n\n\n\np. 273\n\n\n\n2\\. If I indulge now in sexual pleasures, I will be an object of laughter\namongst the Munis. This present trouble has, no doubt, arisen from my Ahamkara\n(egoism). This Ahamkara is the first and foremost in ruining one's Dharma.\n\n\n\n3-5. The wise sages have declared this Ahamkara as the root of this tree of\nworld. I did not observe the vow of silence on seeing those damsels come here;\nI have held much conversations with them; therefore I have got into this\ntroublesome anxiety and sorrow. I have created these damsels at the expense of\nmy Dharma and Tapasya. The beautiful and lovely damsels sent by Indra are now\nfull of lust; and are bent on ruining my tapasaya. Now if through Ahamkara I\nhad not created the damsels, I would not have fallen into this difficulty. Now\nI am caught firmly in the meshes of my own creation like a spider; what am I\nto do next!\n\n\n\n6-7. If I abandon these damsels, thinking that there is no necessity to\nreconsider the matter, then these would be broken hearted; and they would go\naway cursing me?\n\n\n\nYet I would be free from this present danger at least and then be able to\npractise excellent tapasya in a lonely place. Therefore, now, I will get angry\nand tell these damsels go away from me.\n\n\n\n8\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Muni Naraya _n_ a thought that he would become\nthus happy; but, at the next moment, he discussed in his mind thus :--\n\n\n\n9\\. The second great enemy is anger; it is greater than causing hurt to\nothers; and it is greater than lust and avarice.\n\n\n\n10\\. Out of anger people commit murder; this murder is the source of hell and\nis giving pains to all.\n\n\n\n11\\. As trees, rubbing against each other, generate fire; and are themselves\nburnt up in this fire, so fire arising from this body ultimately burns this\nbody to death.\n\n\n\n12\\. Vyasa said :-- The younger brother Nara on seeing his elder brother\nanxious and low-spirited, spoke out what is right, as follows :--\n\n\n\n13\\. O Naraya _n_ a! You are very intelligent and very good; therefore\nreliquish this feeling of anger and betake to quietude and peace, and kill the\ndreadful anger.\n\n\n\n14\\. Do you not remember that it is through this Ahamkara and anger that our\ntapasya was destroyed on a previous occasion; and we had to fight severely\nwith Prahlada, the Lord of the Asuras for one full divine thousand years.\n\n\n\n15-16. O Lord of the Devas! We were put to much difficulties then; therefore O\nLord of the Munis! Get rid of this anger; be quiet! The sages declare the\npeace is the root cause and the only object of Tapasya.\n\n\n\np. 274\n\n\n\n17.Vyasa said :-- On hearing these words of his younger brother Nara, the\nDharma's son Naraya _n_ a took to peace.\n\n\n\n18\\. Janamejaya said :-- O Lord of the Munis! The high souled Prahlada was a\ndevotee of Vi _sn_ u and of a peace loving heart: how it was that, in the\nancient days, the battle took place between him and these Ri _s_ is; how could\nthe Ri _s_ is fight? There is this great doubt in my mind.\n\n\n\n19-20. These two Dharma's sons were ascetics and peace loving; how the fight\ncould come to pass between these and the Daityasuras? How did these two Ri _s_\nis fight with the high souled Prahlada?\n\n\n\n21-22. Prahlada was very religious, full of knowledge and very much devoted to\nVi _sn_ u. Nara Naraya _n_ a were Sattvik and ascetics; therefore if there had\noccurred enmity between those, it appears that the religion and asceticism,\nTapasya and Dharma were matters in name only; and the labour was spent in vain\nin the golden age even. What was the value of asceticism and meditation and\nmuttering silently the mantras! No one can make out.\n\n\n\n23\\. Oh! Persons like them could not conquer their hearts full of anger and\negoism! Anger and jealousy cannot spring unless there be at the bottom a\nfeeling of egoism (Ahamkara).\n\n\n\n24\\. All the passions, lust, greed, anger, etc., come out of Ahamkara\n(egoism), there is no doubt of it; one hundred lakh years of severe asceticism\nare rendered quite useless by the cropping up afterwards of a bit of Ahamkara.\n\n\n\n25\\. As darkness is dispelled entirely on sunrise, so no trace of religious\nmerit can exist on the rising of a bit of Ahamkara.\n\n\n\n26\\. When Prahlada could fight with S'ri Bhagavan Hari, then, Oh! all his\nmerits in this world are rendered of no use whatsoever.\n\n\n\n27\\. Where is the religious merit and where is peace when the quiet souled\npersons Nara Naraya _n_ a, the two Ri _s_ is began to fight, without paying\nany heed to their highest end, the Tapasya?\n\n\n\n28\\. When Ahamkara became invincible by the two Ri _s_ is, then what can be\nexpected from the weak trivial persons like us in the matter of subjugating\nthis Ahamkara?\n\n\n\n29\\. Who can be free from Ahamkara in these three worlds, when the high souled\npersons like the above were not free from it? I am now quite confident that,\nin this Universe, no body was ever before free from Ahamkara nor will there be\nany such in the distant future.\n\n\n\n30\\. One can be free if bound by an iron or a wooden chain; but when one is\npierced by Ahamkara, one can never become free from it.\n\n\n\np. 275\n\n\n\n31\\. This whole Universe, moving and unmoving, is rolling in this Samsara\n(migration and transmigration) polluted by urine and faeces, being covered by\nAhamkara.\n\n\n\n32\\. Where is, then the Brahma J\xc3\xb1ana? O Good One in vows! The Karma theory,\naccording to the Mimamsakas, seems reasonable and true.\n\n\n\n33\\. O Muni! What can you expect from the weak-minded persons like me in this\nKali yuga, when the great persons are always overpowered with lust, anger,\netc.\n\n\n\n34-35. Vyasa said :-- O Descendant of Bharata! How can the effect be different\nfrom its cause? Gold and golden ear-rings though different in form owing to\nupadhis, are both similar to their original cause, the metal gold.\n\n\n\nThread is the cause of cloth; therefore as cloth cannot be different from its\nthread, so this whole universe, moving and unmoving, is sprung from Ahamkara;\nthen how can it be free from Ahamkara?\n\n\n\n36\\. All this, moving and unmoving, including a blade of grass, are fashioned\nout of the three qualities of Maya; so if it be formed of those qualities,\nwhat repentance can come to those who are wise and know every phenomenon as\nunreal?\n\n\n\n37\\. O Best of kings! Brahma, Vi _sn_ u or Mahes'a, even these are all rolling\nin this vast ocean of Samsara, being bewildered and fascinated by Ahamkara.\n\n\n\n38\\. The great sages like Vas'i _st_ ha, Narada and the other Munis are\nfrequently taking their births in this Samsara.\n\n\n\n39\\. In this Triloki, there is not even one embodied soul, who is entirely\nfree from this Maya and has become quiet and immersed in the high bliss of the\nSupreme Self.\n\n\n\n40\\. O Best of kings! Lust, anger, avarice, and fascination, all, arise from\nAhamkara. These do not leave any embodied person.\n\n\n\n41-42. Studying all the Vedas and Pura _n_ as, going to all the sacred places\npilgrimages, making charities, thinking on Paramatman and worshipping the\ngods, doing all these, the people still get attached to sensual objects and\nact like a thief.\n\n\n\n43\\. O Son of Kuru! In the three yugas, the Satya, Treta, Dwapara, Dharma had\nbeen pierced and wounded very much; what to say of Dharma in this Kali Yuga!\n\n\n\n44\\. You will find quarrels, avarice, anger raging always in this Kali yuga.\nTherefore there is no wonder that you will not find any one thinking and doing\nwhat is worth thinking, and doing what is not worth doing?\n\n\n\n45\\. Free from envy, anger, and jealousy, such persons are rare now-a-days in\nthis Kali yuga. Some peaceful persons exist here and there to keep up the\nideal.\n\n\n\np. 276\n\n\n\n46\\. The king said :-- O Muni! They are blessed and holy who are free from\nthis fascination of Maya, self controlled, who have conquered their passions,\nand who follow good conduct. They have risen above the Triloki.\n\n\n\n47\\. O Best of Munis! My high minded father put a dead serpent round the neck\nof an ascetic without any fault; I am very sorry to think of his act.\n\n\n\n48\\. Therefore, O Muni ! Kindly suggest any means by which I can now redress\nthat act. O Bhagavan! I do not know what will be the result of this act,\ncommitted out of the bewildering of intellect.\n\n\n\n49\\. Fools in search of honey see only honey before them but not the falls,\nwhence they might tumble down and die. So the stupid men do disgraceful acts\nand do not get afraid of the tortures of hell.\n\n\n\n50\\. Kindly describe, in detail, how the fight incurred between Prahlada and\nNaraya _n_ a in ancient times.\n\n\n\n51\\. How was it that Prahlada went out of Patala (the nether regions) and went\nto the great holy place, the hermitage of Badarikas'rama in the Sarasvata\ncountry, the great place for pilgrimage.\n\n\n\n52\\. O Muni! What was it that led the best of the Munis, the two ascetics to\nfight with Prahlada?\n\n\n\n53\\. The enmity springs where there is wealth, wife, or land. The two Mahar\n_s_ is were desireless, had nothing of these; how, then, without any cause,\nthey fought such a battle!\n\n\n\n54\\. Prahlada was also very religious and knew that those two Ri _s_ is were\nthe Devas; knowing this, why did he fight with them?\n\n\n\n55\\. So describe in detail the cause of all these.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventh Chapter in the 4th Book of S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses on Ahamkara by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk04ch08.htm)\n\n"
