All the less can their respective attributes be identified.\nHence it follows that it is wrong to superimpose 3 upon the subject--whose\nSelf is intelligence, and which has for its sphere the notion of the Ego--the\nobject whose sphere is the notion of the Non-Ego, and the attributes of the\nobject, and _vice vers a_ to superimpose the subject and the attributes of the\nsubject on the object. In spite of this it is on the part of man a natural 4\nprocedure--\n\np. 4\n\nwhich has its cause in wrong knowledge--not to distinguish the two entities\n(object and subject) and their respective attributes, although they are\nabsolutely distinct, but to superimpose upon each the characteristic nature\nand the attributes of the other, and thus, coupling the Real and the Unreal 1,\nto make use of expressions such as 'That am I,' 'That is mine 2.'--But what\nhave we to understand by the term 'superimposition?'--The apparent\npresentation, in the form of remembrance, to consciousness of something\npreviously observed, in some other thing 3. Some indeed define the term\n'superimposition' as the superimposition of the attributes of one thing on\nanother thing 4. Others, again, define superimposition as the error\n\np. 5\n\nfounded on the non-apprehension of the difference of that which is\nsuperimposed from that on which it is superimposed 1. Others 2, again, define\nit as the fictitious assumption of attributes contrary to the nature of that\nthing on which something else is superimposed. But all these definitions agree\nin so far as they represent superimposition as the apparent presentation of\nthe attributes of one thing in another thing. And therewith agrees also the\npopular view which is exemplified by expressions such as the following:\n'Mother-of-pearl appears like silver,' 'The moon although one only appears as\nif she were double.' But how is it possible that on the interior Self which\nitself is not an object there should be superimposed objects and their\nattributes? For every one superimposes an object only on such other objects as\nare placed before him (i.e. in contact with his sense-organs), and you have\nsaid before that the interior Self which is entirely disconnected from the\nidea of the Thou (the Non-Ego) is never an object. It is not, we reply, non-\nobject in the absolute sense. For it is the object of the notion of the Ego 3,\nand the interior Self is well known to exist on account of its immediate\n(intuitive) presentation. 4 Nor is it an exceptionless rule that objects\n\np. 6\n\ncan be superimposed only on such other objects as are before us, i.e. in\ncontact with our sense-organs; for non-discerning men superimpose on the\nether, which is not the object of sensuous perception, dark-blue colour.\n\nHence it follows that the assumption of the Non-Self being superimposed on the\ninterior Self is not unreasonable.\n\nThis superimposition thus defined, learned men consider to be Nescience\n(avidya), and the ascertainment of the true nature of that which is (the Self)\nby means of the discrimination of that (which is superimposed on the Self),\nthey call knowledge (vidya). There being such knowledge (neither the Self nor\nthe Non-Self) are affected in the least by any blemish or (good) quality\nproduced by their mutual superimposition 1. The mutual superimposition of the\nSelf and the Non-Self, which is termed Nescience, is the presupposition on\nwhich there base all the practical distinctions--those made in ordinary life\nas well as those laid down by the Veda--between means of knowledge, objects of\nknowledge (and knowing persons), and all scriptural texts, whether they are\nconcerned with injunctions and prohibitions (of meritorious and non-\nmeritorious actions), or with final release 2.--But how can the means of right\n\np. 7\n\nknowledge such as perception, inference, &c., and scriptural texts have for\ntheir object that which is dependent on Nescience 1?--Because, we reply, the\nmeans of right knowledge cannot operate unless there be a knowing personality,\nand because the existence of the latter depends on the erroneous notion that\nthe body, the senses, and so on, are identical with, or belong to, the Self of\nthe knowing person. For without the employment of the senses, perception and\nthe other means of right knowledge cannot operate. And without a basis (i.e.\nthe body 2) the senses cannot act. Nor does anybody act by means of a body on\nwhich the nature of the Self is not superimposed 3. Nor can, in the absence of\nall that 4, the Self which, in its own nature is free from all contact, become\na knowing agent. And if there is no knowing agent, the means of right\nknowledge cannot operate (as said above). Hence perception and the other means\nof right knowledge, and the Vedic texts have for their object that which is\ndependent on Nescience. (That human cognitional activity has for its\npresupposition the superimposition described above), follows also from the\nnon-difference in that respect of men from animals. Animals, when sounds or\nother sensible qualities affect their sense of hearing or other senses, recede\nor advance according as the idea derived from the sensation is a comforting or\ndisquieting one. A cow, for instance, when she sees a man approaching with a\nraised stick in his hand, thinks that he wants to beat her, and therefore\nmoves away; while she walks up to a man who advances with some fresh grass in\nhis hand. Thus men also--who possess a higher intelligence--run away when\n\np. 8\n\nthey see strong fierce-looking fellows drawing near with shouts and\nbrandishing swords; while they confidently approach persons of contrary\nappearance and behaviour. We thus see that men and animals follow the same\ncourse of procedure with reference to the means and objects of knowledge. Now\nit is well known that the procedure of animals bases on the non-distinction\n(of Self and Non-Self); we therefore conclude that, as they present the same\nappearances, men also--although distinguished by superior intelligence--\nproceed with regard to perception and so on, in the same way as animals do; as\nlong, that is to say, as the mutual superimposition of Self and Non-Self\nlasts. With reference again to that kind of activity which is founded on the\nVeda (sacrifices and the like), it is true indeed that the reflecting man who\nis qualified to enter on it, does so not without knowing that the Self has a\nrelation to another world; yet that qualification does not depend on the\nknowledge, derivable from the Vedanta-texts, of the true nature of the Self as\nfree from all wants, raised above the distinctions of the Brahma _n_ a and\nKshattriya-classes and so on, transcending transmigratory existence. For such\nknowledge is useless and even contradictory to the claim (on the part of\nsacrificers, &c. to perform certain actions and enjoy their fruits). And\nbefore such knowledge of the Self has arisen, the Vedic texts continue in\ntheir operation, to have for their object that which is dependent on\nNescience. For such texts as the following, 'A Brahma _n_ a is to sacrifice,'\nare operative only on the supposition that on the Self are superimposed\nparticular conditions such as caste, stage of life, age, outward\ncircumstances, and so on. That by superimposition we have to understand the\nnotion of something in some other thing we have already explained. (The\nsuperimposition of the Non-Self will be understood more definitely from the\nfollowing examples.) Extra-personal attributes are superimposed on the Self,\nif a man considers himself sound and entire, or the contrary, as long as his\nwife, children, and so on are sound and entire or not. Attributes of the body\nare superimposed on the Self, if a man\n\np. 9\n\nthinks of himself (his Self) as stout, lean, fair, as standing, walking, or\njumping. Attributes of the sense-organs, if he thinks 'I am mute, or deaf, or\none-eyed, or blind.' Attributes of the internal organ when he considers\nhimself subject to desire, intention, doubt, determination, and so on. Thus\nthe producer of the notion of the Ego (i.e. the internal organ) is\nsuperimposed on the interior Self, which, in reality, is the witness of all\nthe modifications of the internal organ, and vice versa the interior Self,\nwhich is the witness of everything, is superimposed on the internal organ, the\nsenses, and so on. In this way there goes on this natural beginning--and\nendless superimposition, which appears in the form of wrong conception, is the\ncause of individual souls appearing as agents and enjoyers (of the results of\ntheir actions), and is observed by every one.\n\nWith a view to freeing one's self from that wrong notion which is the cause of\nall evil and attaining thereby the knowledge of the absolute unity of the Self\nthe study of the Vedanta-texts is begun. That all the Vedanta-texts have the\nmentioned purport we shall show in this so-called _S_ ariraka-mima _m_ sa 1.\n\nOf this Vedanta-mima _m_ sa about to be explained by us the first Sutra is as\nfollows.\n\n1\\. Then therefore the enquiry into Brahman.\n\nThe word 'then' is here to be taken as denoting immediate consecution; not as\nindicating the introduction of a new subject to be entered upon; for the\nenquiry into Brahman (more literally, the desire of knowing Brahman) is not of\nthat nature 2. Nor has the word 'then' the sense\n\np. 10\n\nof auspiciousness (or blessing); for a word of that meaning could not be\nproperly construed as a part of the sentence. The word 'then' rather acts as\nan auspicious term by being pronounced and heard merely, while it denotes at\nthe same time something else, viz. immediate consecution as said above. That\nthe latter is its meaning follows moreover from the circumstance that the\nrelation in which the result stands to the previous topic (viewed as the cause\nof the result) is non-separate from the relation of immediate consecution 1.\n\nIf, then, the word 'then' intimates immediate consecution it must be explained\non what antecedent the enquiry into Brahman specially depends; just as the\nenquiry into active religious duty (which forms the subject of the Purva Mima\n_m_ sa) specially depends on the antecedent reading of the Veda. The reading\nof the Veda indeed is the common antecedent (for those who wish to enter on an\nenquiry into religious duty as well as for those desirous of knowing Brahman).\nThe special question with regard to the enquiry into Brahman is whether it\npresupposes as its antecedent the understanding of the acts of religious duty\n(which is acquired by means of the Purva Mima _m_ sa). To this question we\nreply in the negative, because for a man who has read the Vedanta-parts of the\nVeda it is possible to enter on the enquiry into Brahman even before engaging\nin the enquiry into religious duty. Nor is it the purport of the word 'then'\nto indicate order of succession; a purport which it serves in other passages,\nas, for instance, in the one enjoining the cutting off of pieces from the\nheart and other\n\np. 11\n\nparts of the sacrificial animal. 1 (For the intimation of order of succession\ncould be intended only if the agent in both cases were the same; but this is\nnot the case), because there is no proof for assuming the enquiry into\nreligious duty and the enquiry into Brahman to stand in the relation of\nprincipal and subordinate matter or the relation of qualification (for a\ncertain act) on the part of the person qualified 2; and because the result as\nwell as the object of the enquiry differs in the two cases. The knowledge of\nactive religious duty has for its fruit transitory felicity, and that again\ndepends on the performance of religious acts. The enquiry into Brahman, on the\nother hand, has for its fruit eternal bliss, and does not depend on the\nperformance of any acts. Acts of religious duty do not yet exist at the time\nwhen they are enquired into, but are something to be accomplished (in the\nfuture); for they depend on the activity of man. In the Brahma-mima _m_ sa, on\nthe other hand, the object of enquiry, i.e. Brahman, is something already\naccomplished (existent),--for it is eternal,--and does not depend on human\nenergy. The two enquiries differ moreover in so far as the operation of their\nrespective fundamental texts is concerned. For the fundamental texts on which\nactive religious duty depends convey information to man in so far only as they\nenjoin on him their own particular subjects (sacrifices, &c.); while the\nfundamental texts about Brahman merely instruct man, without laying on him the\ninjunction of being instructed, instruction being their immediate result. The\ncase is analogous to that of the information regarding objects of sense which\nensues as soon as the objects are approximated to the senses. It therefore is\nrequisite that something should be\n\np. 12\n\nstated subsequent to which the enquiry into Brahman is proposed.--Well, then,\nwe maintain that the antecedent conditions are the discrimination of what is\neternal and what is non-eternal; the renunciation of all desire to enjoy the\nfruit (of one's actions) both here and hereafter; the acquirement of\ntranquillity, self-restraint, and the other means 1, and the desire of final\nrelease. If these conditions exist, a man may, either before entering on an\nenquiry into active religious duty or after that, engage in the enquiry into\nBrahman and come to know it; but not otherwise. The word 'then' therefore\nintimates that the enquiry into Brahman is subsequent to the acquisition of\nthe above-mentioned (spiritual) means.\n\nThe word 'therefore' intimates a reason. Because the Veda, while declaring\nthat the fruit of the agnihotra and similar performances which are means of\nhappiness is non-eternal (as, for instance. _Kh._ Up. VIII, 1, 6, 'As here on\nearth whatever has been acquired by action perishes so perishes in the next\nworld whatever is acquired by acts of religious duty'), teaches at the same\ntime that the highest aim of man is realised by the knowledge of Brahman (as,\nfor instance, Taitt. Up. II, I, 'He who knows Brahman attains the highest');\ntherefore the enquiry into Brahman is to be undertaken subsequently to the\nacquirement of the mentioned means.\n\nBy Brahman is to be understood that the definition of which will be given in\nthe next Sutra (I, 1, 2); it is therefore not to be supposed that the word\nBrahman may here denote something else, as, for instance, the brahminical\ncaste. In the Sutra the genitive case ('of Brahman;' the literal translation\nof the Sutra being 'then therefore the desire of knowledge of Brahman')\ndenotes the object, not something generally supplementary ( _s_ esha 2); for\nthe desire of knowledge\n\np. 13\n\ndemands an object of desire and no other such object is stated.--But why\nshould not the genitive case be taken as expressing the general complementary\nrelation (to express which is its proper office)? Even in that case it might\nconstitute the object of the desire of knowledge, since the general relation\nmay base itself on the more particular one.--This assumption, we reply, would\nmean that we refuse to take Brahman as the direct object, and then again\nindirectly introduce it as the object; an altogether needless procedure.--Not\nneedless; for if we explain the words of the Sutra to mean 'the desire of\nknowledge connected with Brahman' we thereby virtually promise that also all\nthe heads of discussion which bear on Brahman will be treated.--This reason\nalso, we reply, is not strong enough to uphold your interpretation. For the\nstatement of some principal matter already implies all the secondary matters\nconnected therewith. Hence if Brahman, the most eminent of all objects of\nknowledge, is mentioned, this implies already all those objects of enquiry\nwhich the enquiry into Brahman presupposes, and those objects need therefore\nnot be mentioned, especially in the Sutra. Analogously the sentence 'there the\nking is going' implicitly means that the king together with his retinue is\ngoing there. Our interpretation (according to which the Sutra represents\nBrahman as the direct object of knowledge) moreover agrees with Scripture,\nwhich directly represents Brahman as the object of the desire of knowledge;\ncompare, for instance, the passage, 'That from whence these beings are born,\n&c., desire to know that. That is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III, I). With passages\nof this kind the Sutra only agrees if the genitive case is taken to denote the\nobject. Hence we do take it in that sense. The object of the desire is the\nknowledge of Brahman up to its complete comprehension, desires having\nreference to results 1. Knowledge thus constitutes the\n\np. 14\n\nmeans by which the complete comprehension of Brahman is desired to be\nobtained. For the complete comprehension of Brahman is the highest end of man,\nsince it destroys the root of all evil such as Nescience, the seed of the\nentire Sa _m_ sara. Hence the desire of knowing Brahman is to be entertained.\n\nBut, it may be asked, is Brahman known or not known (previously to the enquiry\ninto its nature)? If it is known we need not enter on an enquiry concerning\nit; if it is not known we can not enter on such an enquiry.\n\nWe reply that Brahman is known. Brahman, which is all-knowing and endowed with\nall powers, whose essential nature is eternal purity, intelligence, and\nfreedom, exists. For if we consider the derivation of the word 'Brahman,' from\nthe root b _ri_ h, 'to be great,' we at once understand that eternal purity,\nand so on, belong to Brahman 1. Moreover the existence of Brahman is known on\nthe ground of its being the Self of every one. For every one is conscious of\nthe existence of (his) Self, and never thinks 'I am not.' If the existence of\nthe Self were not known, every one would think 'I am not.' And this Self (of\nwhose existence all are conscious) is Brahman. But if Brahman is generally\nknown as the Self, there is no room for an enquiry into it! Not so, we reply;\nfor there is a conflict of opinions as to its special nature. Unlearned people\nand the Lokayatikas are of opinion that the mere body endowed with the quality\nof intelligence is the Self; others that the organs endowed with intelligence\nare the Self; others maintain that the internal organ is the Self; others,\nagain, that the Self is a mere momentary idea; others, again, that it is the\nVoid. Others, again (to proceed to the opinion of such as acknowledge the\nauthority of the Veda), maintain that there is a transmigrating being\ndifferent from the body, and so on, which is both agent and enjoyer (of the\nfruits of action); others teach\n\np. 15\n\nthat that being is enjoying only, not acting; others believe that in addition\nto the individual souls, there is an all-knowing, all-powerful Lord 1. Others,\nfinally, (i.e. the Vedantins) maintain that the Lord is the Self of the\nenjoyer (i.e. of the individual soul whose individual existence is apparent\nonly, the product of Nescience).\n\nThus there are many various opinions, basing part of them on sound arguments\nand scriptural texts, part of them on fallacious arguments and scriptural\ntexts misunderstood 2. If therefore a man would embrace some one of these\nopinions without previous consideration, he would bar himself from the highest\nbeatitude and incur grievous loss. For this reason the first Sutra proposes,\nunder the designation of an enquiry into Brahman, a disquisition of the\nVedanta-texts, to be carried on with the help of conformable arguments, and\nhaving for its aim the highest beatitude.\n\nSo far it has been said that Brahman is to be enquired into. The question now\narises what the characteristics of that Brahman are, and the reverend author\nof the Sutras therefore propounds the following aphorism.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[3:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_36) The subject is the universal Self whose nature is\nintelligence ( _k_ it); the object comprises whatever is of a non-intelligent\nnature, viz. bodies with their sense organs, internal organs, and the objects\nof the senses, i.e. the external material world.\n\n[3:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_37) The object is said to have for its sphere the notion\nof the 'thou' (yushmat), not the notion of the 'this' or 'that' (idam), in\norder better to mark its absolute opposition to the subject or Ego. Language\nallows of the co-ordination of the pronouns of the first and the third person\n('It is I,' 'I am he who,' &c.; ete vayam, ime vayam asmahe), but not of the\nco-ordination of the pronouns of the first and second person.\n\n[3:3](sbe34007.htm#fr_38) Adhyasa, literally 'superimposition' in the sense of\n(mistaken) ascription or imputation, to something, of an essential nature or\nattributes not belonging to it. See later on.\n\n[3:4](sbe34007.htm#fr_39) Natural, i.e. original, beginngless; for the modes\nof speech p. 4 and action which characterise transmigratory existence have\nexisted, with the latter, from all eternity.\n\n[4:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_40) I.e. the intelligent Self which is the only reality\nand the non-real objects, viz. body and so on, which are the product of wrong\nknowledge.\n\n[4:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_41) 'The body, &c. is my Self;' 'sickness, death,\nchildren, wealth, &c., belong to my Self.'\n\n[4:3](sbe34007.htm#fr_42) Literally 'in some other place.' The clause 'in the\nform of remembrance' is added, the Bhamati remarks, in order to exclude those\ncases where something previously observed is recognised in some other thing or\nplace; as when, for instance, the generic character of a cow which was\npreviously observed in a black cow again presents itself to consciousness in a\ngrey cow, or when Devadatta whom we first saw in Pa _t_ aliputra again appears\nbefore us in Mahishmati. These are cases of recognition where the object\npreviously observed again presents itself to our senses; while in mere\nremembrance the object previously perceived is not in renewed contact with the\nsenses. Mere remembrance operates in the case of adhyasa, as when we mistake\nmother-of-pearl for silver which is at the time not present but remembered\nonly.\n\n[4:4](sbe34007.htm#fr_43) The so-called anyathakhyativadins maintain that in\nthe act of adhyasa the attributes of one thing, silver for instance, are\nsuperimposed on a different thing existing in a different place, mother-of-\npearl for instance (if we take for our example of adhyasa the case of some man\nmistaking a piece of mother-of-pearl before him for a piece of silver). The\natmakhyativadins maintain that in adhyasa the modification, in the form of\nsilver, of the internal organ and action which characterise transmigratory\nexistence have existed, with the latter, from all eternity.p. 5 is\nsuperimposed on the external thing mother-of-pearl and thus itself appears\nexternal. Both views fall under the above definition.\n\n[5:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_44) This is the definition of the akhyativadins.\n\n[5:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_45) Some anyathakhyativadins and the Madhyamikas\naccording to \xc3\x82nanda Giri.\n\n[5:3](sbe34007.htm#fr_46) The pratyagatman is in reality non-object, for it is\nsvayampraka _s_ a, self-luminous, i.e. the subjective factor in all cognition.\nBut it becomes the object of the idea of the Ego in so far as it is limited,\nconditioned by its adjuncts which are the product of Nescience, viz. the\ninternal organ, the senses and the subtle and gross bodies, i. e. in so far as\nit is _g_ iva, individual or personal soul. Cp. Bhamati, pp. 22, 23: ' _k_\nidatmaiva svayampraka _s_ os#pi buddhyadivishayavi _kkh_ ura _n_ at katha _mk_\nid asmatpratyayavishayos#ha _m_ karaspada _m_ giva iti _k_ a _g_ antur iti _k_\na kshetra _g \xc3\xb1_a iti _k_ akhyayate.'\n\n[5:4](sbe34007.htm#fr_47) Translated according to the Bhamati. We deny, the\nobjector says, the possibility of adhyasa in the case of the Self, not on the\nground that it is not an object because self-luminous (for that it p. 6 may be\nan object although it is self-luminous you have shown), but on the ground that\nit is not an object because it is not manifested either by itself or by\nanything else.--It is known or manifest, the Vedantin replies, on account of\nits immediate presentation (aparokshatvat), i.e. on account of the intuitional\nknowledge we have of it. \xc3\x82nanda Giri construes the above clause in a different\nway: asmatpratyayavishayatves#py aparokshatvad ekantenavishayatvabbavat\ntasminn aha _n_ karadyadhyasa ity artha _h_. Aparokshatvam api kai _sk_ id\natmano nesh _t_ am ity asa _n_ kyaha pratyagatmeti.\n\n[6:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_48) Tatraiva _m_ sati evambhutavastutattvavadhara _n_ e\nsati. Bha.

The senses cannot act unless guided by a\nsuperintending principle, i.e. the individual soul.\n\n[7:3](sbe34007.htm#fr_52) If activity could proceed from the body itself, non-\nidentified with the Self, it would take place in deep sleep also.\n\n[7:4](sbe34007.htm#fr_53) I.e. in the absence of the mutual superimposition of\nthe Self and the Non-Self and their attributes.\n\n[9:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_54) The Mima _m_ sa, i.e. the enquiry whose aim it is to\nshow that the embodied Self, i.e. the individual or personal soul is one with\nBrahman. This Mima _m_ sa being an enquiry into the meaning of the Vedanta-\nportions of the Veda, it is also called Vedanta mima _m_ sa.\n\n[9:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_55) Nadhikarartha iti. Tatra hetur brahmeti.

But in the case of verbs of desiring object and result\ncoincide.\n\n[14:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_62) That Brahman exists we know, even before entering\non the Brahma-mima _m_ sa, from the occurrence of the word in the Veda, &c.,\nand from the etymology of the word we at once infer Brahman's chief\nattributes.\n\n[15:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_63) The three last opinions are those of the followers\nof the Nyaya, the Sa _n_ khya, and the Yoga-philosophy respectively. The three\nopinions mentioned first belong to various materialistic schools; the two\nsubsequent ones to two sects of Bauddha philosophers.\n\n[15:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_64) As, for instance, the passages 'this person\nconsists of the essence of food;' 'the eye, &c. spoke;' 'non-existing this was\nin the beginning,' &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 2](sbe34008.htm)\n\n"
