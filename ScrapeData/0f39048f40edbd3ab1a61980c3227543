Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1899], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 260\n\n### BOOK THE THIRTY-FIRST.\n\nPURUSHA hath a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a  \nthousand feet.  \nPervading earth on every side he fills a space ten fingers  \nbroad.  \n2 Purusha is in truth this All, what hath been and what yet  \nshall be;  \nLord, too, of immortality which waxes greater still by food.  \n3 So mighty in his grandeur; yea, greater than this is Purusha.  \nAll creatures are one fourth of him, three fourths eternal  \nlife in heaven.\n\np. 261\n\n4 With three fourths Purusha rose up: one fourth of him  \nagain was here.  \nThence he moved forth to every side over what eats not  \nand what eats.  \n5 From him Viraj was born; again Purusha from Viraj was  \nborn.  \nWhen born, he spread to west and east beyond the boundaries  \nof earth.  \n6 From that great General Sacrifice the dripping fat was  \ngathered up.  \nHe formed the creatures of the air and animals both wild  \nand tame.  \n7 From that great General Sacrifice Richas and Sama hymns  \nwere born:  \nTherefrom were spells and charms produced; the Yajus  \nhad its birth from it.  \n8 From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows  \nof teeth  \nFrom it were generated kine, from it were goats and sheep  \nproduced.  \n9 They balmed as victim on the grass Purusha born in earliest  \ntime.  \nWith him the Deities and all Sadhyas and Rishis sacrificed.  \n10 When they divided Purusha how many portions did they  \nmake?\n\np. 262\n\nWhat was his mouth? what were his arms? what are the  \nnames of thighs and feet?  \n11 The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the  \nRajanya made.  \nHis thighs became the Vaisya, from his feet the Sudra was  \nproduced.  \n12 The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye  \nthe Sun had birth;  \nVayu and Prana from his ear, and from his mouth was Agni  \nborn.  \n13 Forth from his navel came mid-air; the sky was fashioned  \nfrom his head;  \nEarth from his feet, and from his ear the Quarters. Thus  \nthey formed the worlds.  \n14 When Gods performed the sacrifice with Purusha as offering  \nSpring was the butter, Autumn the oblation, Summer was  \nthe wood.  \n15 Then seven were his enclosing-sticks, his kindling-brands  \nwere three times seven,  \nWhen Gods, performing sacrifice, bound as their victim  \nPurusha.  \n16 Gods, sacrificing, sacrificed the victim: these were the earliest  \nholy ordinances.  \nThe Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where  \nthe Sadhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.\n\np. 263\n\n17 In the beginning he was formed, collected from waters, earth,  \nand Visvakarman's essence.  \nFixing the form thereof Tvashtar proceedeth. This was at  \nfirst the mortal's birth and godhead.  \n18 I know this mighty Purusha whose colour is like the Sun,  \nbeyond the reach of darkness.  \nHe only who knows him leaves Death behind him. There is  \nno path save this alone to travel.  \n19 In the womb moves Prajapati: he, never becoming born, is  \nborn in sundry figures.  \nThe wise discern the womb from which he springeth. In  \nhim alone stand all existing creatures.  \n20 He who gives light and heat to Gods, first, foremost Agent  \nof the Gods,  \nBorn ere the Gods\xc2\x97to him the bright, the holy One, be  \nreverence  \n21 Thus spake the Gods at first, as they begat the bright and  \nholy One:  \nThe Brahman who may know thee thus shall have the Gods  \nin his control.  \n22 Beauty and Fortune are thy wives: each side of thee are  \nDay and Night.  \nThe constellations are thy form: the Asvins are thine open  \njaws.  \nWishing, wish yonder world for me, wish that the Universe  \nbe mine.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XXXII](wyvbk32.htm)\n\n"
