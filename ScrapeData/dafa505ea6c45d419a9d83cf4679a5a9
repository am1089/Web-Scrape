He puts a Svayam-at _ri_ _n_ _n_ a (naturally-perforated brick) on\n(the gold man);--the (first) naturally-perforated one being this earth, he\nthus puts this earth thereon. He puts it on so as not to be separate from the\nman; for the naturally-perforated one means food, and the naturally-perforated\none means this earth, and this earth is food, since it is on her that all food\nripens: he thus places food close to him (the man, Agni). Upon (the man he\nputs it): he thus places the food upon him 1.\n\n7:4:2:22\\. And, again, why he puts on a naturally-perforated one;--the\nnaturally-perforated (brick) is the breath (or vital air), for the breath thus\nbores itself (svayam at _ri_ ntte) through the body: it is breath he thus\nbestows on it. He puts it so as not to be separate from the man; for the\nnaturally-perforated one is the breath, and the naturally-perforated one is\nthis earth, and this earth is the breath, since this earth bears everything\nthat breathes: he thus puts the breath so as not to be separate from him. Upon\n(the man he places the brick): he thus puts the breath upon him 1.\n\n7:4:2:33\\. And, again, why he puts thereon the naturally-perforated one. The\ndeities, taking up the disjointed Pra _g_ apati, separated; and, having\nobtained a resting-place in them, thus separated, he settled down.\n\n7:4:2:44\\. Now that Pra _g_ apati who became disjointed is this very Agni\n(fire-altar) that is now being built up; and that resting-place (or,\nfoundation) is this first\n\np. 378\n\nnaturally-perforated (brick);--thus when he now puts it on, he thereby puts\nupon this (altar-site) that (foundation 1) which there was for his body: that\nis why he now puts it on.\n\n7:4:2:55\\. He puts it on by means of Pra _g_ apati, for Pra _g_ apati thereby\ntook back to himself (that foundation) of his body. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 16]\n'Steady thou art,' that is, 'Firm thou art, or established thou\nart;'--'supporting,' for that which supports is a foundation;--'laid down by\nVi _s_ vakarman;' Vi _s_ vakarman is Pra _g_ apati, thus, 'laid down by that\none;'--'May the ocean, may the bird not injure thee!' the ocean doubtless is\nthe gold plate, and the bird is the man: thus, 'May those two not injure\nthee!'--'Not shaking, steady thou the earth!' as the text, so the meaning.\n\n7:4:2:66\\. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 17] 'May Pra _g_ apati settle thee'--for Pra _g_\napati saw this first layer 2;--'on the back of the waters, on the way of the\nocean,' the back of the waters doubtless is this earth, and the way of the\nocean is this earth;--'thee, the wide, the broad one!' for this earth is both\nwide and broad;--'broaden thou: thou art the broad one!' that is, 'broaden\nthou, and thou art the broad (earth, p _ri_ thivi).'\n\n7:4:2:77\\. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 18] 'Thou art the earth (bhu),' for this is the\nearth;--'thou art the ground (bhumi),' for this is the ground;--'Thou art\nAditi,'--Aditi is this earth, for this earth gives (dad)\n\np. 379\n\neverything here;--'the all-containing,' for on this earth everything is\ncontained;--'supporter of all the world,' that is, supporter of the whole\nworld;--'sustain the earth, steady the earth, injure not the earth!' that is,\nsustain thyself, steady thyself, injure, not thyself!\n\n7:4:2:88\\. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 19] 'For all breathing, out-breathing, through-\nbreathing, and up-breathing;' for the naturally-perforated (brick) is the\nbreath, and the breath serves for all that;--'for a resting-place, for a\nmoving-place;' the naturally-perforated (bricks) are these worlds 1, and these\nworlds are the resting-place, the moving-place;--'May Agni guard thee'--that\nis, may Agni protect thee!--'with mighty well-being!' that is, with great\nwell-being;--'with the safest roof,' that is, with whatever roof (abode) is\nthe safest. Having 'settled' it 2, he pronounces the Sudadohas 3 on it: the\nmeaning of this has been explained. He then sings a Saman: the meaning of this\n(will be explained) further on.\n\n7:4:2:99\\. Here now they say, 'How is it that that (gold) man is not held\n(weighed) down by the naturally-perforated (brick) 4?' Well, the naturally-\nperforated (brick) is food and breath; and man is not held down either by food\nor by his breath.\n\n7:4:2:1010\\. He then lays the Darya-brick 5 thereon;--the Durva-brick being\ncattle; it is with cattle he\n\np. 380\n\nthus endows it: these are the same cattle together with which Agni on that\nformer occasion approached 1; it is them he now puts thereon. He lays it down\nimmediately on the naturally-perforated (brick); the naturally-perforated\n(brick) being this earth, he thus places the cattle immediately on this earth.\nUpon (the brick he places it): upon this earth he thereby places cattle.\n\n7:4:2:1111\\. And, again, why he lays down the Durva-brick. The hair of Pra _g_\napati which were lying on the ground when he was disjointed became these\nherbs. The vital air then went out from within him, and, that having gone out,\nhe fell down.\n\n7:4:2:1212\\. He said, 'Verily, this (vital air) has undone me!' and because he\nsaid, 'it has undone (dhurv) me,' hence (the name) 'dhurva;' 'dhurva'\ndoubtless being what is mystically called 'durva,' for the gods love the\nmystic. That (durva grass) is the ruling power (Kshatra), for it is this vital\nsap, the breath; and the other plants are the hair: in laying down that (durva\nplant) he lays down all (kinds of) plants.\n\n7:4:2:1313\\. When the gods restored him, they put that life-sap, the breath,\ninside him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now put it into him. He\nlays it down immediately on the naturally-perforated (brick); the naturally-\nperforated one being this earth, he thus places the plants immediately on this\nearth. Upon (the brick he lays it): upon this earth he thus places the plants.\nIt should be with root and top, for completeness' sake. Let him lay it on in\nsuch manner that while lying on the naturally-perforated (brick) it touches\nthe ground (with its\n\np. 381\n\ntops) 1, for on this earth those (plants) spring up, and along her they grow.\n\n7:4:2:1414\\. He lays it on, with (Va _g_. S. XIII, 20-21), 'Growing up joint\nby joint, knot by knot;' for joint by joint, and knot by knot that (grass)\ndoes grow up;--'so do thou prolong us, O Durva (plant), by a thousand, and a\nhundred (descendants)!' as the text, so its meaning.\n\n7:4:2:1515\\. 'Thou that spreadest by a hundred, and branchest out by a\nthousand (shoots);' for by a hundred (shoots) it spreads, and by a thousand it\nbranches out;--'to thee, O divine brick, we will do homage by offering;' as\nthe text, so the meaning. With two (verses) he puts it on: the meaning of this\nhas been explained. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sudadohas upon it:\nthe meaning of this has been explained.\n\n7:4:2:1616\\. He then puts down a Dviya _g_ us 2 (brick). Indra and Agni\ndesired, 'May we go to the heavenly world!' They saw that dviya _g_ us brick,\neven this earth, and laid it down; and having laid it down, they went to the\nheavenly world from that foundation. In like manner when this Sacrificer lays\ndown a dviya _g_ us (brick), (he does so) thinking, 'I want to go to the\nheavenly world by the same means (rupa), by performing the same rite by which\nIndra and Agni went to the heavenly world!' And as to its being called 'dviya\n_g_ us,' it is because two deities saw it. And as to why he lays down a dviya\n_g_ us one: the dviya _g_ us doubtless is the Sacrificer.\n\np. 382\n\n7:4:2:1717\\. Here now they say, 'If (the dviya _g_ us) is that same Sacrificer\nwho is that gold man, which then is that (real) form of his?' Well, that (gold\nman) is his divine body, and this (brick) is his human one. As to that gold\nman, that is his immortal form, his divine form; gold being immortal. And as\nto this (brick) being made of clay, it is because this is his human form.\n\n7:4:2:1818\\. Now were he only to lay down that (golden man), and not to let\nthis dviya _g_ us (brick) remain 1, the Sacrificer surely would quickly pass\naway from this world; but now that he allows this (brick) to remain, he\nthereby leaves to him this human form of his; and so he attains with this body\nthe full (measure of) life.\n\n7:4:2:1919\\. And were he not to put it on after (the gold man), he assuredly\nwould not afterwards find out that divine body 2; but now that he puts it on\nthereafter, he does so afterwards find out that divine body. He lays it down\nclose to the durva-brick the durva-brick being cattle, he thus establishes the\nSacrificer in (the possession of) cattle.\n\n7:4:2:2020\\. Here now they say, 'How do those two bodies of his come to be\nconnected together by the breath, and not severed?' Well, the naturally-\nperforated (brick) is the breath, and the durva-brick is the breath, and the\ndviya _g_ us (-brick) is the Sacrificer:\n\np. 383\n\nand inasmuch as he lays down the durva-brick close to the naturally-perforated\none, he thereby connects and joins breath with breath; and inasmuch as he lays\ndown the dviya _g_ us one close to the durva-brick--the durva-brick being the\nbreath, and the dviya _g_ us the Sacrificer--those two bodies of his (the\nhuman one and the divine one) thus become connected together by the breath,\nand not severed.\n\n7:4:2:2121\\. [He lays down the dviya _g_ us brick, with Va _g_. S. XIII, 22,\n23] 'O Agni, what lights of thine in the sun overspread the sky by their\nbeams, with all those help us to light and to people!--O ye gods, what lights\nof yours are in the sun, and what lights are in kine and horses, O Indra and\nAgni, with all those bestow light upon us, O B _ri_ haspati!' for 'light' he\nprays each time: light being immortality, it is immortality he thus bestows on\nhim (Agni, and the Sacrificer). With two (verses) he lays it down: the\nsignificance of this has been explained. And, moreover, it is because that\nmaterial form (of the brick) is a twofold one, (consisting as it does of) clay\nand water. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sudadohas upon it: the\nsignificance of this has been explained.\n\n7:4:2:2222\\. He then lays down two Reta _h_ si _k_ (seed-shedding\nbricks);--the seed-shedders doubtless are these two worlds, for these two\nworlds do shed seed;--this (terrestrial world) sheds seed upwards from here\n(in the form of) smoke; it becomes rain in yonder world, and that rain yonder\nworld (sheds) from above: hence (creatures) are born within these two worlds,\nand therefore these two worlds are seed-shedders.\n\n7:4:2:2323\\. [He lays them down, with Va _g_. S. XIII, 24]\n\np. 384\n\n[paragraph continues] 'The wide-ruling one contained the light;' the wide-\nruling ones doubtless is this (terrestrial) world: it contains this fire, the\nlight.--'The self-ruling one contained the light,' the self-ruling 1 one\ndoubtless is yonder world: it contains yonder sun, the light. And the wide-\nruling one and the self-ruling one being these two worlds, he lays them down\nseparately, for separate are these two worlds. He 'settles' them once: he\nthereby makes them one and the same (or, joined together), whence the ends of\nthese two worlds meet.\n\n7:4:2:2424\\. And, again, why he lays down two seed-shedders; the seed-shedders\nare the testicles, for only he who has testicles sheds seed. 'The wide-ruling\none contained the light;--the self-ruling one contained the light,' he says;\nfor the wide-ruling and the self-ruling ones are the testicles: they contain\nthat light, the seed, Pra _g_ apati. He lays them down separately, for\nseparate are these testicles. He 'settles' them once: he thereby makes them\none and the same, whence they have a common connecting-part. He lays them down\nclose to the dviya _g_ us (brick) 2: the dviya _g_ us being the Sacrificer, he\nthus puts the testicles together with the Sacrificer.\n\n7:4:2:2525\\. He then lays down a Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis (all-light brick) 3;--the\nfirst 'all-light' (brick) 4 is Agni, for Agni\n\np. 385\n\nis all the light in this (terrestrial) world: it is Agni he thus lays down. He\nlays it down close to the seed-shedding ones,--the seed-shedding ones being\nthese two worlds, he thus places Agni together with these two worlds. He lays\nit down between (the two Reta _h_ si _k_  1), for Agni (the fire) is within\nthese two worlds.\n\n7:4:2:2626\\. And, again, why he lays down an 'all-light' (brick);--the 'all-\nlight' (brick) is progeny, for progeny is all the light: he thus lays\ngenerative power (into Agni). He lays it down so as not to be separated from\nthe seed-shedding (bricks),--the seed-shedders being the testicles, he thus\nmakes the generative power inseparable from the testicles. He lays it down\nbetween (those two), for within the testicles progeny is produced.\n\n7:4:2:2727\\. [He lays it down, with Va _g_. S. XIII, 24] 'May Pra _g_ apati\nsettle thee'--for Pra _g_ apati saw this first layer 2;--'on the back of the\nearth, thee the brilliant one!' for on the back of the earth this brilliant\nAgni indeed is.\n\n7:4:2:2828\\. 'For all breathing, out-breathing, through-breathing,'--the all-\nlight (brick) is breath, and breath is (necessary) for this entire\nuniverse;--'give all the light!' that is, 'give the whole light;'--'Agni is\nthine over-lord,' he thus makes Agni the over-lord of this earth. Having\n'settled' it 3, he\n\np. 386\n\npronounces the Sudadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.\n\n7:4:2:2929\\. He then lays down two _Ri_ tavya (seasonal bricks);--the two\nseasonal (bricks) being the same as the seasons, it is the seasons he thus\nlays down. [Va _g_. S. XIII, 25] 'Madhu and Madhava, the two spring seasons,'\n--these are the names of those two: it is thus by their names that he lays\nthem down. There are two (such) bricks, for two months are a season. He\n'settles' them once 1: he thereby makes (the two months) one season.\n\n7:4:2:3030\\. And as to why he now lays down these two;--this Agni (fire-altar)\nis the year, and the year is these worlds; the first layer is this\n(terrestrial) world thereof, and the spring season also is this world thereof;\nand when he now lays down those two (bricks), he thereby puts back into him\n(Agni-Pra _g_ apati) what those two (the first layer and the spring) are to\nthat body of his 2: this is why he now lays down those two (bricks).\n\n7:4:2:3131\\. And, again, why he now lays down these two;--this Agni is Pra _g_\napati, and Pra _g_ apati is the year; the first layer is his foundation, and\nthe spring season also is his foundation;--thus when he now lays down these\ntwo (bricks), he thereby puts back into him what those two are to that body of\nhis: this is why he now lays down those two (bricks). He lays them down close\nto the 'all-light' brick: the 'all-light' brick being progeny, he thus lays\nprogeny close together with the seasons; whence progeny is produced in\naccordance with the seasons, for by seasons people compute (the age of man)\n\np. 387\n\nwhilst in the state of embryo, and by seasons when he is born.\n\n7:4:2:3232\\. He then lays down the Asha _dh_ a (invincible brick) 1,--the\n'invincible one' being this earth, it is this earth he thus lays down. He puts\nit on the fore-part (of the altar-site), for this earth was created first.\n\n7:4:2:3333\\. And as to its being called Asha _dh_ a. The gods and the Asuras,\nboth of them sprung from Pra _g_ apati, strove together. The gods saw this\ninvincible brick, even this earth; they put it on (the altar); and having put\nit on, they conquered (and drove) the Asuras, the enemies, the rivals, from\nthis universe; and inasmuch as (thereby) they conquered (asahanta), it is\ncalled Asha _dh_ a. In like manner the Sacrificer, after putting on that\n(brick), conquers (and drives) his spiteful rival from this universe (or, from\neverything here).\n\n7:4:2:3434\\. And, again, why he lays down the Asha _dh_ a. The Asha _dh_ a is\nspeech, and by speech 2 the gods then indeed conquered (and drove) the Asuras,\nthe enemies, the rivals, from this universe; and in like manner the\nSacrificer, by means of speech, conquers (and drives) his spiteful rival from\nthis universe: it was speech the gods then laid down (or bestowed on Agni),\nand in like manner the Sacrificer now lays down speech.\n\n7:4:2:3535\\. This earth is the bearer of what is desirable; for--the desirable\nbeing the vital airs--this earth bears everything that breathes, and for that\nreason this earth is the bearer of what is desirable. But\n\np. 388\n\nspeech (the mouth) also indeed is the bearer of what is desirable; for the\ndesirable is the vital airs, and for the (channels of) the vital airs food is\nput into the mouth: therefore speech is the bearer of what is desirable.\n\n7:4:2:3636\\. Now the Asha _dh_ a is the same as those vital airs; he lays it\ndown in the fore-part (of the altar): he thus bestows (on Agni the organs of)\nthe vital airs in front; whence there are here (organs of) the vital airs in\nfront (of the body). Let him not in this layer enclose this (Asha _dh_ a) in\nfront by any other brick which has a special prayer of its own, lest he close\nup (the organs of) the vital airs.\n\n7:4:2:3737\\. And as to why he lays down in front five Apasyas 1,--water (ap)\nis food, and by food (the organs of) the vital airs are not closed up. He lays\ndown (the Asha _dh_ a) close to the two seasonal ones: he thereby establishes\nspeech in the seasons, and hence speech (the mouth) speaks here, firmly\nestablished in the seasons.\n\n7:4:2:3838\\. Here now they say, 'If the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis (brick) is\nprogeny, and the Asha _dh_ a speech, why does he put the two seasonal ones\nbetween them?' Well, the seasonal ones being the year, he thus separates\nspeech from progeny by the year, and hence children utter speech at the time\n(or age) of a year.\n\n7:4:2:3939\\. [He lays down the Asha _dh_ a, with Va _g_. S. XIII, 26] 'Thou\nart Asha _dh_ a, the conquering,' for the gods thereby conquered the\nAsuras,--'conquer the enemies! conquer the hostile!' as the text, so the\nmeaning;--'thou hast a thousand energies: do thou speed me!' a thousand means\n\np. 389\n\nall: thus, 'thou hast all energies, do thou speed me!' When he has 'settled'\nit, he pronounces the Sudadohas on it: the significance of this has been\nexplained.\n\n7:4:2:4040\\. Here now they say, 'Why are those other bricks placed in front of\nthe naturally-perforated one?' Let him say, There are two wombs\n(birthplaces)--the one being the womb of the gods, the other the womb of men:\nthe gods have their birthplace in the east, and men in the west; and when he\nlays down those (bricks) in front, he thereby causes the Sacrificer to be born\nfrom the womb of the gods.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[377:1](sbe4164.htm#fr_698) ? Viz. inasmuch as the food is introduced into the\nbody from above. It might also mean, he makes the food superior to the body,\ninasmuch as the body cannot exist without it. Similarly as regards the breath\nin the next paragraph.\n\n[378:1](sbe4164.htm#fr_699) The 'pratish _th_ a' (basis) of the bird-shaped\nAgni includes the parts on which the bird stands or sits, viz. the feet, and\nthe hind-part of the body.
