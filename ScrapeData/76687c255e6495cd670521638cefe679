The Upa _m_ _s_ u (graha), forsooth, is the out-breathing of the\nSacrifice 1, the Upa _m_ _s_ u-savana (press-stone) the through-breathing, and\nthe Antaryama (graha) the in-breathing.\n\n4:1:1:22\\. Now as to why it is called Upa _m_ _s_ u. There is a graha called A\n_m_ _s_ u 2, that is Pra _g_ apati: his out-breathing is this (graha); and\nbecause it is his out-breathing, therefore it is called Upa _m_ _s_ u.\n\n4:1:1:33\\. This (graha) he draws without a strainer 3: whereby he puts the\nout-breathing into him as one tending away from him, and thus this forward-\ntending out-breathing of his streams forth from him. He purifies it with\nsprigs of Soma, thinking 'it shall be pure.' He purifies it with six (sprigs),\nfor there are six seasons: it is by means of the seasons that he thus purifies\nit.\n\n4:1:1:44\\. As to this they say, 'When he purifies the Upa _m_ _s_ u by means\nof sprigs, and all (other) Soma-draughts\n\np. 249\n\nare purified by means of a strainer, whereby, then, do its sprigs become\npure?'\n\n4:1:1:55\\. He throws them down again (on the unpressed plants) with (Va _g_.\nS. VII, 2), 'What inviolable, quickening name is thine, to that Soma of thine,\nO Soma, be Hail!' Thus his sprigs become purified by means of the Svaha\n('Hail!'). But this graha means everything, for it is the type of all the\npressings 1.\n\n4:1:1:66\\. Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were\nafraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They said, 'Let us completely\nestablish the sacrifice: if the Asura-Rakshas should then attack us, our\nsacrifice will at least be completely established.'\n\n4:1:1:77\\. Even at the morning Soma-feast they then completely established the\nentire sacrifice 2,--at this same (upa _m_ _s_ u) graha by means of the Ya _g_\nus; at the first chant (stotra) by means of the Saman; and at the first\nrecitation ( _s_ astra) by means of the _Ri_ k: with that sacrifice thus\ncompletely established they subsequently worshipped. And in like manner does\nthis sacrifice now become completely established,--by means of the Ya _g_ us\nat this same graha; by means of the Saman at the first chant; and by means of\nthe _Ri_ k at the first recitation; and with this sacrifice thus completely\nestablished he subsequently worships.\n\n4:1:1:88\\. He presses (the Soma) eight times; for of eight\n\np. 250\n\nsyllables consists the Gayatri, and the morning Soma-feast belongs to the\nGayatri; thus this (first turn of pressing) is made to be the morning Soma-\nfeast.\n\n4:1:1:99\\. He draws (the juice of the first turn of pressing into the cup)\nwith (Va _g_. S. VII, 1), 'Grow thou pure for Va _k_ aspati!' for Va _k_\naspati (lord of speech) is the out-breathing, and this (Upa _m_ _s_ u) graha\nis the out-breathing: hence he says, 'Grow thou pure for Va _k_\naspati!'--'purified by the hands with the sprigs of the bull;' for he purifies\nit with sprigs of Soma: hence he says, 'with the sprigs of the bull;' and\n'purified by the hands (gabhasti-puta 1),' he says; for--'gabhasti' being the\nsame as 'pani' (hand)--he indeed purifies it with his hands.\n\n4:1:1:1010\\. He then presses eleven times; for of eleven syllables consists\nthe Trish _t_ ubh, and the midday Soma-feast belongs to the Trish _t_ ubh:\nthus this (second turn of pressing) is made to be the midday Soma-feast.\n\n4:1:1:1111\\. He draws (the juice into the cup) with, 'Grow thou pure, a god,\nfor the gods--;' for he (Soma) is indeed a god, and for the gods he becomes\npure;--'whose portion thou art;' for he indeed is their portion.\n\n4:1:1:1212\\. He then presses twelve times; for of twelve syllables consists\nthe _G_ agati, and the evening Soma-feast belongs to the _G_ agati: thus this\n(third turn of pressing) is made to be the evening Soma-feast.\n\np. 251\n\n4:1:1:1313\\. He draws (the juice) with, 'Make thou our draughts sweet!'\nwhereby he imbues him (Soma) with sap, and renders him palatable for the gods:\nhence, when slain, he does not become putrid 1. And when he offers (that\ngraha) he thereby completely establishes him.\n\n4:1:1:1414\\. 'For one desirous of spiritual lustre (brahmavar _k_ asa) he\nshould press eight times at each (turn),' so they say;--for of eight syllables\nconsists the Gayatri, and the Gayatri is the Brahman: he indeed becomes\nendowed with spiritual lustre.\n\n4:1:1:1515\\. Thus the pressing amounts to twenty-four times (of beating). Now\nthere are twenty-four half-moons in the year; and Pra _g_ apati (the lord of\ncreatures) is the year, and the sacrifice is Pra _g_ apati: thus as great as\nthe sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, so great he thereby establishes\nit.\n\n4:1:1:1616\\. 'For one desirous of cattle he should press five times at each\n(turn),' so they say;--the cattle (animal victims) consist of five parts: he\nindeed gains cattle; and there are five seasons in the year; and Pra _g_ apati\nis the year, and the sacrifice is Pra _g_ apati thus as great as the sacrifice\nis, as great as is its measure, so great he thereby establishes it. This,\nhowever, is mere speculation: it is the other (manner) which is practised.\n\n4:1:1:1717\\. Having drawn the graha, he wipes (the vessel) all round, lest any\n(Soma-juice) should trickle down. He does not deposit it; for this is his out-\nbreathing, whence this out-breathing passes unceasingly. Should he, however,\ndesire to exorcise, he may\n\np. 252\n\ndeposit it 1 with, 'I put thee down, the out-breathing of N.N.!' Thus,\nforsooth, inasmuch as he (the Adhvaryu) does not quit his hold of it, it is\nnot again in that (enemy); and thus both the Adhvaryu and the Sacrificer live\nlong.\n\n4:1:1:1818\\. Or he may merely cover (the vessel by his hand) with, 'I shut\nthee off, the out-breathing of N.N.!' Thus, forsooth, inasmuch as he does not\ndeposit it, it is not again in that enemy; and thus he does not disorder the\nvital airs.\n\n4:1:1:1919\\. While he is still inside (the Havirdhana) he utters 'Hail!' For\nthe gods were afraid lest the Asura-Rakshas should destroy what part of this\ngraha was previous to the offering. They offered it (symbolically) by means of\nthe Svaha, while they were still inside (the cart-shed), and what was thus\noffered they afterwards offered up in the fire. And in like manner does he now\noffer it up by means of the Svaha, while he is still inside, and what has thus\nbeen offered he afterwards offers up in the fire.\n\n4:1:1:2020\\. He then walks out (of the Havirdhana) with, 'I walk along the\nwide air 2.' For along the air\n\np. 253\n\nthe Rakshas roams rootless and unfettered on both sides, even as man here\nroams along the air, rootless and unfettered on both sides 1; and, that\nformula being the Brahman (prayer), a slayer of the Rakshas, he, by means of\nthat Brahman, renders the air free from danger and injury.\n\n4:1:1:2121\\. Thereupon he (the Sacrificer) asks a boon. For the gods,\nforsooth, greatly desire to obtain the offering of that graha, and they grant\nto him that boon, in order that he may forthwith offer that graha to them:\nthis is why he asks a boon.\n\n4:1:1:2222\\. He (the Adhvaryu) offers with (Va _g_. S. VII, 3), 'Self-made\nthou art,' for, this graha being his (Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a's) out-breathing, it is\nindeed made by itself, born of itself 2: hence he says, 'Self-made thou\nart;'--'for all powers, divine and earthly,'--for it is born of itself for all\ncreatures 3;--'May the mind obtain thee!'--the mind being Pra _g_ apati, he\nthereby means to say, 'may Pra _g_ apati obtain thee!' 'Hail! thee, O well-\nborn, for Surya!' thus he utters the second 4\n\np. 254\n\n[paragraph continues] (or inferior) 'Hail!' with regard to a subsequent 1 (or\nhigher; the highest) deity.\n\n4:1:1:2323\\. Now it is in him that burns yonder (the sun) that he has just\noffered that (libation); and the latter is the All: hence he makes that (sun)\nthe highest of the All. But were he to utter the second (or higher) 'Hail!'\nwith regard to a preceding (or lower) deity 2, then it would be even higher\nthan yonder sun: therefore he utters the second 'Hail!' with regard to a\nsubsequent deity.\n\n4:1:1:2424\\. And, having offered, he wipes the (vessel of the) graha upwards;\nwhereby he puts that out-breathing into him as one tending away from him.\nThereupon he rubs (the wiped-off Soma) upon the middle enclosing stick from\nwest to east with the palm of his hand turned upwards 3\\--whereby he puts that\nout-breathing into him as one tending away from him--with, 'Thee to the gods\nsipping motes of light!'\n\n4:1:1:2525\\. For in that orb which burns yonder he has just offered this\n(libation), and those rays thereof are the gods sipping motes of light: it is\nthese he thereby gratifies; and thus gratified those gods convey him to the\nheavenly world.\n\n4:1:1:2626\\. For this same graha there is neither an invitatory prayer nor an\noffering prayer 4: he offers it\n\np. 255\n\nwith a (Ya _g_ us) formula, and thereby it becomes for him supplied with both\nan invitatory and an offering prayer. And if he desire to exorcise, let him\noffer some spray (of Soma) which may adhere either to his arm, or to his\nbreast, or to his garment, with, 'O divine plant, let that be true wherefore I\npray thee: let N.N. be struck down by destruction falling from above, crash!'\nEven as one of (enemies) that are being slain might escape, so does this\n(sprig) fly away from those that are being pressed: thus nothing\n(hostile)--either running thither or running away 1\\--remains to him for whom\nhe performs this. He deposits that (cup) with, 'Thee for the out-breathing!'\nfor this (graha) indeed is his out-breathing.\n\n4:1:1:2727\\. Now some deposit it on the south part (of the khara 2), for, they\nsay, it is in that direction that\n\np. 256\n\nyonder (sun) moves. Let him, however, not do this, but let him deposit it on\nthe north (uttara) part (of the khara), because there is not any higher\n(uttara) graha than this. He deposits it with, 'Thee for the out-breathing!'\nfor this (graha) is indeed his out-breathing.\n\n4:1:1:2828\\. He then takes the Upa _m_ _s_ u-savana (pressing-stone). He\nneither touches it with the fringe nor with the straining-cloth, for that\nwould be like rinsing it in water. If there be any spray adhering to it, let\nhim remove it with his hand, and then lay down (the stone) beside (the Upa _m_\n_s_ u cup), with the face towards the north, with, 'Thee for the through-\nbreathing!' for this (stone) is indeed his (Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a's) through-breathing.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[248:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_602) That is, the sacrificial man, or the sacrifice\npersonified in Soma and the sacrificer.\n\n[248:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_603) Lit. 'the Soma-plant,' hence the (Soma)-sacrifice\nitself, or Pra _g_ apati. See [IV, 6, 1, 1](sbe2670.htm#4:6:1:1) seq.\n\n[248:3](sbe2640.htm#fr_604) Bahishpavitrat, lit. from (a vessel, or Soma)\nhaving the strainer outside (away from) it. While no proper strainer is used\nfor the Upa _m_ _s_ u-graha, the Soma-juice being poured through Soma-plants\n(see [p. 244](sbe2639.htm#page_244), note [2](sbe2639.htm#fn_596)); at the\ngreat pressing it is passed through a fringed straining-cloth (da _s_\napavitra) spread over the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a (the largest of the three Soma-\ntroughs, the others being the \xc3\x82dhavaniya and Putabh _ri_ t). See [IV, 1, 2,\n3](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:3).\n\n[249:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_605) Viz. inasmuch as the Upa _m_ _s_ u-graha is\nobtained by three turns of pressing, and each of the three Savanas (pressings,\nSoma-feasts) consists of three rounds of pressing of three turns each. See p.\n256, note [1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619).\n\n[249:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_606) Cf. Taitt. S. VI, 4, 5, where this theory\n(divested of its legendary form) is ascribed to Aru _n_ a Aupave _s_ i.\n\n[250:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_607) Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. S. I, 4, 2, interprets it,\n'Having been purified by the ray of the sun (while growing in the forest), do\nthou now become pure for the gods through the sprigs of the bull!' Cf.,\nhowever, Taitt. S. VI, 4, 5, 'gabhastina hy enam pavayati,' where 'gabhasti'\nwould seem to be taken in the sense of hand' (? the forked one). See [p.\n244](sbe2639.htm#page_244), note [2](sbe2639.htm#fn_596).\n\n[251:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_608) The Ka _n_ va text adds, 'while whosoever else is\nslain becomes putrid.'\n\n[252:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_609) That is, he may set it down on the khara for a\nmoment without quitting his hold of it. While the subsequent cups of Soma are\ndeposited in their respective places after they have been drawn, the Upa _m_\n_s_ u and Antaryama are offered immediately.\n\n[252:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_610) With the Taittiriyas the order of proceeding is\nsomewhat different: The Adhvaryu pours the Soma through the Soma-plants into\nthe Upa _m_ _s_ u cup after each turn of pressing, with, 'Become pure for Va\n_k_ aspati, O courser!'--'The bull purified by the hand with the plants of the\nbull!'--'Thou, a god, art a purifier of the gods whose share thou art: thee,\nto them!' respectively. He then takes the cup from the Pratiprasthat _ri_\nwith, 'Thou art self-made' eyes it with, 'Make our drinks sweet;' and wipes it\nclean upwards with, 'Thee for all powers, divine and earthly!' He then rises\nwith, 'May the mind obtain thee!' steps to the \xc3\x82havaniya with, 'I move p. 253\nalong the wide air,' and offers, while the sacrificer holds on to him from\nbehind, with, 'Hail! thee, O well-born, to Surya!'\n\n[253:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_611) See [III, 1, 3, 13](sbe2605.htm#3:1:3:13).\n\n[253:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_612) 'For this libation is the out-breathing, and the\nout-breathing is he that blows yonder (the wind); and he indeed is made by\nhimself, begotten ( _g_ ata) of himself, since there is no other maker nor\nbegetter of him.' Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[253:3](sbe2640.htm#fr_613) Perhaps we ought to translate the passage, 'from\nall the powers, divine and earthly,' for it is born by itself from all the\ncreatures. But cf. Taitt. S. VI, 4, 5: 'Thereby he puts out-breathing both\ninto gods and men.'\n\n[253:4](sbe2640.htm#fr_614) While, in its force of 'subsequent,' avara here\nrefers back to the first Svaha, pronounced by the Adhvaryu ([par.\n19](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:19)); it also has here the meaning of 'lower,' and,\ndeveloped out of this, that of 'preceding' (in which meaning it occurs in the\n_Ri_ kprati _s_ akhya). Hence it is quite impossible adequately to render this\nplay on the words avara, 'subsequent, lower, preceding,' and para, 'higher,\nsubsequent.'\n\n[254:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_615) That is, coming after Svaha in the formula.\n\n[254:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_616) The Ka _n_ va text reads: etasmin va etan ma _n_\n_d_ ale 'haushid ya esha tapati; sarvam u va esha graha _h_ ; sarvasmad\nevaitad asmad enam uttara _m_ karoti ya esho 'smat sarvasmad uttaro yad\ndhavara _m_ devata _m_ kuryat para _m_ svahakaram anyad dhaitasmad uttara _m_\nkuryat.\n\n[254:3](sbe2640.htm#fr_617) That is to say, he is to pass his hand, palm\nupwards, under the middle enclosing stick.\n\n[254:4](sbe2640.htm#fr_618) Such ( _Ri_ k verses) as are ordinarily recited by\nthe Hot _ri_ : When p. 255 the Upa _m_ _s_ u cup is drawn, the Hot _ri_ says,\n'Restrain the out-breathing (pra _n_ a)! Hail! thee, O well-calling one, to\nSurya!' whereupon he breathes into (or towards) the cup with, 'O out-\nbreathing, restrain my out-breathing!' After that he remains silent till the\nAntaryama is drawn, when he addresses that graha with, 'Restrain the in-\nbreathing (apana)! Hail! thee, O well-calling one, to Surya!' whereupon he\ndraws in his breath over the cup, and says, 'O in-breathing, restrain my in-\nbreathing!' He then touches the pressing-stone with, 'Thee to the through-\nbreathing!' and therewith frees his speech from restraint. Ait. Br. II, 21. On\nthe terms out-breathing (pra _n_ a) and in-breathing (apana, or up-breathing,\nudana) see part i, p. 19, note 2; J. S. Speijer, Jatakarma, p. 64; Saya _n_ a\non Taitt. S. I, 4, 3 (vol. i, p.603); Taitt. S. VI, 4: 6. Different Haug, Ait.\nBr. Transl. p. 118.\n\n[255:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_619) 'Na dhavan napadhavat pari _s_ ishyate;' perhaps\nwe ought to read 'napadhavan;' unless indeed 'tasya' refers to Soma, as Saya\n_n_ a seems to take it. The Ka _n_ va text has: tatha ha tesha _m_ napadhava\n_\xc3\xb1_ s _k_ ana mu _k_ yate yebhyas tatha karoti.\n\n[255:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_620) According to the Sutras of the Black Ya _g_ us\n(cf. Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S. I, 4, 2, p. 598), the Upa _m_ _s_ u cup is\n'deposited' on the south-east and the Antaryama cup on the north-east corner\nof the p. 256 khara or mound; the Upa _m_ _s_ u-savana stone being placed\nbetween them. Before depositing the vessel, the Adhvaryu pours some of the\nresidue of Soma-juice from the Upa _m_ _s_ u cup into the \xc3\x82graya _n_ asthali,\nand having put a large twig of Soma into it for the evening pressing (? the\nAdabhya graha, cf. Say. on Taitt. S. I, 603), he deposits it on the mound.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe2641.htm)\n\n"
