Offer ye these songs to Rudra whose bow is strong, whose arrows are swift,\nthe self-dependent [1](sbe3259.htm#an_7:46:1:1) god, the unconquered\nconqueror, the intelligent, whose weapons are sharp--may he hear us!\n\n2\\. For, being the lord [1](sbe3259.htm#an_7:46:2:1), he looks after what is\nborn on earth; being the universal ruler, he looks after what is born in\nheaven. Protecting us, come to our protecting doors, be without illness among\nour people, O Rudra!\n\n3\\. May that thunderbolt of thine, which, sent from heaven, traverses the\nearth, pass us by! A thousand medicines are thine, O thou who art freely\naccessible [1](sbe3259.htm#an_7:46:3:1); do not hurt us in our kith and kin!\n\n4\\. Do not strike us, O Rudra, do not forsake us! May we not be in thy way\nwhen thou rushest forth furiously. Let us have our altar and a good report\namong men [1](sbe3259.htm#an_7:46:4:1)--protect us always with your favours!\n\np. 437\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Vasish _th_ a. Verse 1 occurs TB. II, 8, 6, 8. Metre, 1-3 _G_\nagati; 4 Trish _t_ ubh.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The TB. has svadha\xc2\xb4mne for svadha\xc2\xb4vne, mi _d_ kushe for vedhase, and\n_s_ _ri_ _n_ otana for _s_ _ri_ _n_ otu na _h_. The commentator explains both\nsvadhamne = svakiyasthanayuktaya, and svadhavne = svadha _s_ abdava _k_\nyenannena yuktaya va. On vedhas, see Bartholomae, K. Z. XXVII, 361; Ludwig, Z.\nD. M. G. XL, 716.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Geldner translates kshaye _n_ a by \'from his high seat.\' The meaning\nof kshaya in this place seems defined by the parallel expression sa\xc2\xb4mra _g_\nyena.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Svapivata has been variously translated. Grassmann gives\nVielbegehrter; Ludwig, des windhauch in schlaf versenkt; Roth, wohl\nverstehend, denkend; Geldner, freundlicher; Muir, thou who art easy of access,\nwhich seems to me the right rendering; cf. supayana. It is derived from api +\nvat, which occurs six times in the Rig-veda. As a simple verb it means \'to go\nnear, to attend,\' as a causative, the same, or \'to bring near.\' Thus, VII; 3,\n10. api kratum su- _k_ etasam vatema, may we obtain wisdom, full of good\nthoughts. VII, 60, 6. api kratum su- _k_ etasam vatanta _h_ , (the gods)\nobtaining wisdom, full of good thoughts (for their worshippers). X, 20, 1 (X,\n25, 1). bhadram na _h_ api vataya mana _h_ , let us obtain a good mind. I,\n128, 2. tam ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-sa\xc2\xb4dham api vatayamasi, we go near to, or we bring\nnear Agni, the performer of the sacrifice. I, 165, 13. manmani--api-vatayanta\n_h_ , bringing the prayers near, or attending to the prayers. X, 13, 5. pitre\nputra\xc2\xb4sa _h_ api avivatan _ri_ tam, the sons brought the sacrifice to the\nfather.\n\nApi-vata would then mean approach, or in a more\n\np. 438\n\nspiritual sense, attention, regard, and su-apivata would mean either of easy\napproach, opposed to durdharsha, or full of kind attention and regard. See\nMuir, S _T_. IV, p. 314. note. Bergaigne, III, 306, does not help us much,\nthough he points out where the difficulty lies.\n\nThe following are the Zend passages in which api-vat occurs, with some notes\nsent me by Dr. Stein: Apivatahe, Y. 9, 27, 2. p. sg. med. c. Gen. \'Hom, du\nverstehst dich auf rechte Preisspruche\' d. h. kannst sie wurdigen;\' apivataite\ndaenayao mazdaya\xc3\xa7nois, V. 9, 2, 47, \'vertraut mit dem Gesetz; daena\xc2\xb4m zarazca\ndat\xcc\xa3 apaeca aotat, yt. 9, 26: \'wer das Gesetz lernt und in dasselbe\neindringt;\' verezyotuca fraca vatoyotu, Y. 35, 6, \'das richtig erkannte fuhre\ner aus und theile es mit;\' Y. 44, 18 scheint apivaiti 1. p. sg. med. in der\nBedeutung: \'in Erfahrung gebracht haben;\' die Stelle ist indess sehr dunkel.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x82\xc2\xb4 na _h_ bha _g_ a barhishi _g_ iva _s_ a _m_ se seems a very simple\nsentence. It has been translated without any misgivings by Grassmann, Ludwig,\nGeldner and Kaegi and others.\n\nGrassmann translates: \'Lass lange lebend uns die Streu noch schmucken.\'\n\nLudwig: \'Gib uns anteil an dem barhis als verheiszung des lebens.\'\n\nKaegi and Geldner (or Roth): \'Verstatt uns Theil an Opfer und an Herrschaft.\'\n\nBergaigne often points to such translations with scorn, but after he has\nwritten several pages on the words in question, here on _g_ iva _s_ a _m_ sa,\nhe is indeed very positive that it means \'formule qui donne la vie\' (I, p.\n306), but what such a \'formule\' is, and how this meaning fits the whole\nsentence, he does not tell us.\n\nLet us begin with what is clear. \xc3\x82\xc2\xb4 bha _g_ a na _h_ with locative, means\n\'appoint us to something,\' i. e. \'give us something.\' Thus I, 121, 15. a\xc2\xb4 na\n_h_ bha _g_ a goshu, means \'divide us, distribute us, appoint us to cows,\' i.\ne. \'give us cows as our share.\' The same expression is used when\n\np. 439\n\ninstead of cows or riches, the gods are asked to give long life, glory, or\nsinlessness. Thus we read, I, 104, 6. sa _h_ tvam na _h_ indra su\xc2\xb4rye sa _h_\napsu anagastve a\xc2\xb4 bha _g_ a _g_ iva _s_ a _m_ se, that is,\' Indra, allow us to\nshare and rejoice in the sun, in water, in sinlessness and praise of men.\' X,\n45, 10. a\xc2\xb4 tam bha _g_ a sau _s_ ravaseshu, \'give him, let him share in, good\nrenown.\'\n\nWhen we are once familiar with this phraseology, we cannot doubt that in our\npassage also we have to translate, let us have our barhis, our homely altar,\nand good report among men.\'\n\nAnother word nara _s_ a _m_ sa had originally the same meaning as _g_ iva _s_\na _m_ sa, but it was chiefly used as a name of Agni. He was called Nara _s_ a\n_m_ sa, i. e. Mannerlob, or dyo _h_ _s_ a _m_ sa, Himmelslob, as a German poet\nwas once called Frauenlob, not only because he praised women, but because he\nwas praised by women. As we can say, God is my song, the Vedic _Ri_ shis might\ncall any god the _s_ a _m_ sa, i. e. the praise or song of men, of the\nfathers, or of the gods. So far from agreeing with Bergaigne, \'on comprendrait\nmoins bien qu\'une locution dont le sens propre aurait ete "eloge mortel" e.ut\ndesigne celui qui est loue par le mortel,\' nothing is easier and better\nconfirmed by other languages, while the invocation of \'une formule sacree\' is\nalmost unintelligible. If in a later hymn Indra is called _g_ yesh _th_ a _h_\nmantra _h_ , in X, 50, 4, I should translate, \'thou art the oldest or the best\nsong,\' that is, \'the theme of the oldest song,\' but not thou art a magic\nformula. There is no necessity therefore for taking nara _s_ a _m_ sa as a\npossessive compound, possessed of the praise of men, nor must we forget that\nin words which become almost proper names the accent is by no means always a\nsafe guide.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2.
