Let a man meditate on the syllable Om, for the udgitha is sung beginning\nwith Om. And this is the full account of the syllable Om--\n\n2\\. The Devas, being afraid of death, entered upon (the performance of the\nsacrifice prescribed in) the threefold knowledge (the three Vedas). They\ncovered themselves with the metrical hymns. Because they covered ( _kh_ ad)\nthemselves with the hymns, therefore the hymns are called _kh_ andas.\n\n3\\. Then, as a fisherman might observe a fish in the water, Death observed the\nDevas in the _Ri_ _k_ , Ya _g_ us, and Saman-(sacrifices). And the Devas\nseeing this, rose from the _Ri_ _k_ , Ya _g_ us, and Saman-sacrifices, and\nentered the Svara 1, i.e. the Om (they meditated on the Om).\n\n4\\. When a man has mastered the Rig-veda, he says quite loud Om; the same,\nwhen he has mastered the Saman and the Ya _g_ us. This Svara is the\nimperishable (syllable), the immortal, free from fear. Because the Devas\nentered it, therefore they became immortal, and free from fear.\n\n5\\. He who knowing this loudly pronounces (pra _n_ auti) 2\\- that syllable,\nenters the same (imperishable) syllable, the Svara, the immortal, free from\nfear, and having entered it, becomes immortal, as the Devas are immortal.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[11:1](sbe01025.htm#fr_91) Cf.
