Means of Livelihood for a Brahman in Times of Distress.\n\n56. 56 In times of distress, a Brahman is allowed to gain his substance in the mode prescribed for the caste next to him in rank; or he may gain his substance like a Vai _s_ ya. But he must never resort to\n\np. 56\n\nthe mode of livelihood prescribed for a member of the lowest caste.\n\n57. 57 At no time must a Brahman follow the occupations of a man of vile caste, or a vile man the occupations of a Brahman. In either case, expulsion from caste would be the immediate consequence.\n\n* 58. 58 For neither of them are such occupations permitted as are either far above or far below their own rank. Those two occupations are lawful for them which lie between these two extremes; for they are common to all (castes).\n\n59. 59 When a Brahman has lived through the times of distress, with the wealth acquired by following the occupations of a Kshatriya, he must perform a penance and relinquish the occupations of a Kshatriya.\n\n60. 60 When, however, a Brahman takes delight in those occupations and persists in them, he is declared a Ka _n_ _d_ ap _ri_ sh _th_ a (professional soldier) and must be expelled from society, because he has swerved from the path of duty.\n\np. 57\n\n61. 61 When a Brahman is living by the occupations of a Vai _s_ ya, he must never sell milk, sour milk, clarified butter, honey, beeswax, lac, pungent condiments, liquids used for flavouring, spirituous liquor,\n\n62. 62 Meat, boiled rice, sesamum, linen, the juice of the Soma plant, flowers, fruit, precious stones, men, poison, weapons, water, salt, cakes, plants,\n\n63. 63 Garments, silk, skins, bone, blankets made of the hair of the mountain-goat, animals whose foot is not cloven, earthen pots, buttermilk, hair, dregs, vegetables, fresh ginger, and herbs.\n\n64. 64 A Brahman may sell dry wood and (dry) grass, excepting fragrant substances, Eraka grass, ratan, mulberry, roots, and Ku _s_ a grass.\n\n65\\. (He may sell) twigs of bamboo that have fallen spontaneously, of fruits,\nthe fruits of the jujube tree,\n\np. 58\n\nand of the I\xe1\xb9\x85guda plant, ropes, and thread of cotton, if its shape has not\nbeen altered (by working it up).\n\n66\\. If it is for a medicament used to cure a disease, or for an offering, or\nif necessity can be shown, he may sell sesamum for a corresponding quantity of\ngrain.\n\n67\\. A Brahman who swerves from the path of duty by selling prohibited\narticles, must be reminded of his duty by the king by inflicting a severe\nchastisement on him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[55:56](sbe3311.htm#fr_165) 'The class next to him in rank,' i.e. the\nKshatriya or warrior caste. If he should find himself unable to support his\nfamily by the mode of livelihood of his own caste, he may gain his substance\nlike a Kshatriya. At the time of a drought or famine, he may gain his\nsubstance like a Vai _s_ ya even. 'The lowest caste,' i.e. the _S_ udra caste.\nA. Manu X, 81, 82; Vish _n_ u II, 15; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 35; Gautama VII,\n6, 7; Baudhayana II, 4, 16, &c.\n\n[56:57](sbe3311.htm#fr_166) By the term 'a vile man,' a member of the _S_ udra\ncaste is referred to. The occupations of such a man, i.e. the acceptance of\nfood from everybody and the sale of all sorts of commodities, must never be\nresorted to by a Brahman, even in times of distress. And so must a _S_ udra\navoid the occupation of a Brahman, such as wearing the sacred thread, study of\nthe Vedas, pronouncing sacred benedictions, offering burnt-oblations, and the\nrest. A.\n\n[56:58](sbe3311.htm#fr_167) 'Such occupations as are either far above or far\nbelow their own rank,' i.e. the occupations of a Brahman and of a _S_ udra\nrespectively. 'Those two occupations,' i.e. those peculiar to the Kshatriya\nand Vai _s_ ya. A. hitva seems a faulty reading (for hite).\n\n[56:59](sbe3311.htm#fr_168) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 35.\n\n[56:60](sbe3311.htm#fr_169) 'Ejected from society,' i.e. he must not be\nadmitted to obsequial repasts and other religious ceremonies. A.\n\n[57:61](sbe3311.htm#fr_170) 61-66. Manu X, 85-90; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III,\n36-39; Gautama VII, 8-22; Vasish _th_ a II, 24-31; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 20, 11\nfoll.\n\n61\\. 'Pungent condiments,' such as sugar. 'Liquids,' such as clarified butter\nand oil. A.\n\n[57:62](sbe3311.htm#fr_171) A. explains the term Soma, 'the juice of the Soma\nplant,' which is offered to the gods at a sacrifice, as denoting sacrificial\nimplements generally; 'men,' i.e. servants; 'plants,' i.e. shrubs, creeping\nplants, and others. A.\n\n[57:63](sbe3311.htm#fr_172) 'Blankets,' i.e. what is made of wool. 'Animals\nwhose foot is not cloven,' i.e. whole-hoofed animals, such as horses. 'Dregs,'\ni.e. the deposit of oil. 'Vegetables,' i.e. fresh pot-herbs. A.\n\n[57:64](sbe3311.htm#fr_173) 'Fragrant substances,' such as the fragrant root\nof the plant Andropogon Muricatus, Balaka, the root of the Musta grass, and\nothers. A. If the reading of a single MS. be followed, the sale of the\narticles enumerated in pars. 64 and 65 is also prohibited for a Brahman.\nSeveral of these articles are included among those substances the sale of\nwhich is prohibited by other. legislators. See Manu X, 86-89; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya III, 36-39. However, the reading translated above is distinctly\nsupported by the Commentary of Asahaya, and by the analogous rules of Vasish\n_th_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5. Modes of Proof](sbe3312.htm)\n\n"
