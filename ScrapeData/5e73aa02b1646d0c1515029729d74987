'Look at your Self in a pan of water, and whatever you do not understand\nof your Self 1, come and tell me.'\n\nThey looked in the water-pan. Then Pra _g_ apati said to them: 'What do you\nsee?'\n\nThey said: 'We both see the self thus altogether, a picture even to the very\nhairs and nails.'\n\n2\\. Pra _g_ apati said to them: 'After you have adorned yourselves, have put\non your best clothes and cleaned yourselves, look again into the water-pan.\n\nThey, after having adorned themselves, having put on their best clothes and\ncleaned themselves, looked into the water-pan.\n\nPra _g_ apati said: 'What do you see?'\n\n3\\. They said: 'Just as we are, well adorned, with our best clothes and clean,\nthus we are both there, Sir, well adorned, with our best clothes and clean.'\n\nPra _g_ apati said: 'That is the Self, this is the immortal, the fearless,\nthis is Brahman.'\n\nThen both went away satisfied in their hearts.\n\n4\\. And Pra _g_ apati, looking after them, said: 'They both go away without\nhaving perceived and without having known the Self, and whoever of these two\n2, whether Devas or Asuras, will follow this doctrine (upanishad), will\nperish.'\n\nNow Virokana, satisfied in his heart, went to the Asuras and preached that\ndoctrine to them, that the self (the body) alone is to be worshipped, that the\n\np. 137\n\nself (the body) alone is to be served, and that he who worships the self and\nserves the self, gains both worlds, this and the next.\n\n5\\. Therefore they call even now a man who does not give alms here, who has no\nfaith, and offers no sacrifices, an \xc3\x82sura, for this is the doctrine\n(upanishad) of the Asuras. They deck out the body of the dead with perfumes,\nflowers, and fine raiment by way of ornament, and think they will thus conquer\nthat world 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[136:1](sbe01168.htm#fr_347) I take atmana _h_ as a genitive, governed by yad,\nnot as an accusative plural.\n\n[136:2](sbe01168.htm#fr_348) The commentator reads yatare for yata _h_.\n\n[137:1](sbe01168.htm#fr_349) This evidently refers to the customs and teaching\nof tribes not entirely conforming to the Brahmanic system. Whether the\nadorning of the dead body implies burial instead of burning, seems doubtful.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 9](sbe01169.htm)\n\n"
