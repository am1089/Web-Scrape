Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.\n\n1\\. Beyond measure they waxed strong, just fell short of touching the heavens.\nWhen they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished, the Sri\xc3\xb1gaya Vaitahavyas.  \n2\\. The persons who pierced Brihatsaman, the descendant of Angiras, the\nBrahmana--a ram with two rows of teeth, a sheep devoured their offspring.  \n3\\. They who spat upon the Brahmana, who desired tribute from him, they sit in\nthe middle of a pool of blood, chewing hair.  \n4\\. The cow of the Brahman, when roasted, as far as she reaches does she\ndestroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is born (there).  \n5\\. A cruel (sacrilegious) deed is her slaughter, her meat, when eaten, is\nsapless; when her milk is drunk, that surely is accounted a crime against the\nFathers.  \n6\\. When the king, weening himself mighty, desires to destroy the Brahmana,\nthen royal power is dissipated, where the Brahmana is oppressed.  \n7\\. Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed, two-mouthed,\ntwo-tongued, she dispels the rule of the oppressor of the Brahman.  \n8\\. That (kingdom) surely she swamps, as water a leaking ship; misfortune\nstrikes that kingdom, in which they injure a Brahmana.  \n9\\. The trees chase away with the words: 'do not come within our shade,' him\nwho covets the wealth that belongs to a Brahmana, O Narada!  \n10\\. King Varuna pronounced this (to be) poison, prepared by the gods: no one\nwho has devoured the cow of a Brahmana retains the charge of a kingdom.  \n11\\. Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off, because they had\ninjured the offspring of a Brahmana, were ruined irretrievably.  \n12\\. The kudi-plant (Christ's thorn) that wipes away the track (of death),\nwhich they fasten to the dead, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the\ngods did declare (to be) thy couch.  \n13\\. The tears which have rolled from (the eyes of) the oppressed (Brahman),\nas he laments, these very ones, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did assign\nto thee as thy share of water.  \n14\\. The water with which they bathe the dead, with which they moisten his\nbeard, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did assign to thee as\nthy share of water.  \n15\\. The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the oppressor of Brahmans;\nthe assembly is not complacent for him, he does not guide his friend according\nto his will.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 7.
