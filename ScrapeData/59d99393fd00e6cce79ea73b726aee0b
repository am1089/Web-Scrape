When morning  \n   broke,  \nThe heroes from their rest awoke.  \nBetimes the son of Raghu rose,  \nWith gentle Sita, from repose,  \nAnd sipped the cool delicious wave  \nSweet with the scent the lotus gave,  \nThen to the Gods and sacred flame  \nThe heroes and the lady came,  \nAnd bent their heads in honour meet  \nWithin the hermit's pure retreat.  \nWhen every stain was purged away,  \nThey saw the rising Lord of Day:  \nThen to Sutikhna's side they went,  \nAnd softly spoke, most reverent:  \n   'Well have we slept, O holy lord,  \nHonoured of thee by all adored:  \nNow leave to journey forth we pray:  \nThese hermits urge us on our way.  \nWe haste to visit, wandering by,  \nThe ascetics' homes that round you lie,  \nAnd roaming Dandak's mighty wood  \nTo view each saintly brotherhood,  \nFor thy permission now we sue,  \nWith these high saints to duty true,  \nBy penance taught each sense to tame,--  \nIn lustre like the smokeless flame.  \nEre on our brows the sun can beat  \nWith fierce intolerable heat.  \nLike some unworthy lord who wins  \nHis power by tyranny and sins,  \nO saint, we fain would part.' The three  \nBent humbly to the dovotee.  \nHe raised the princes as they pressed  \nHis feet, and strained them to his breast;  \nAnd then the chief of devotees  \nBespake them both in words like these.  \n'Go with thy brother, Rama, go,  \nPursue thy path untouched by woe:  \nGo with thy faithful Sita, she  \nStill like a shadow follows thee  \nRoam Dandak wood observing well  \nThe pleasant homes where hermits dwell,--  \nPure saints whose ordered souls adhere  \nTo penance rites and vows austere.  \n\nThere plenteous roots and berries grow,  \nAnd noble trees their blossoms show,  \nAnd gentle deer and birds of air  \nIn peaceful troops are gathered there.  \nThere see the full-blown lotus stud  \nThe bosom of the lucid flood,  \nAnd watch the joyous mallard shake  \nThe reeds that fringe the pool and lake.  \nSee with delighted eye the rill  \nLeap sparkling from her parent hill,  \nAnd hear the woods that round thee lie  \nReecho to the peacock's cry.  \nAnd as I bid thy brother, so,  \nSumitra's child, I bid thee go.  \nGo forth, these varied beauties see,  \nAnd then once more return to me.'  \n   Thus spake the sage Sutikshna: both  \nThe chiefs assented, nothing loth.  \nRound him with circling steps they paced,  \nThen for the road prepared with haste.  \nTnere Sita stood, the dame long-eyed,  \nFair quivers round their waists she tied,  \nAnd gave each prince his trusty bow,  \nAnd sword which ne*er a spot might know.  \nEach took his quiver from her *and.  \nAnd clanging bow and gleaming brand:  \nThen from the hermits' home the two  \nWent forth each woodland scene to view.  \nEavh beauteous in the bloom of age,  \nDismissed by that illustrious sage,  \nWith bow and sword accoutred, hied  \nAway, and Sita by their side.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto IX.: Sita's Speech.](ry207.htm)\n\n"
