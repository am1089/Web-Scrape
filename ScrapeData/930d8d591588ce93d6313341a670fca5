Here (follows the student's) going the rounds for alms.\n\n2 2-4. A Brahma _n_ a should beg, addressing (the woman from whom he begs\nalms) with the word 'Lady' put at the beginning (of his request),\n\n3\\. A Ra _g_ anya, with the word 'Lady' inserted in the middle,\n\n4\\. A Vai _s_ ya, with the word 'Lady' put at the end.\n\n5 5. (He should beg) from three women who will not refuse;\n\np. 309\n\n6\\. From six, twelve, or an indefinite number.\n\n7\\. From his own mother first, according to some (teachers).\n\n8 8. Having announced the alms received to his teacher, he should stand,\nkeeping silence, through the rest of the day, according to some.\n\n9 9. Having fetched fire-wood out of the forest without damaging (trees), he\nshould put them on that fire as above, and should abandon his silence.\n\n10\\. He should sleep on the ground and eat no pungent or saline food.\n\n11\\. Wearing the staff, worshipping the fire, being obedient to his Guru,\ngoing the rounds for alms\xc2\x97(these are the standing duties of students).\n\n12 12. He should avoid honey or flesh, bathing (for pleasure), sitting on high\nseats, going to women, falsehood, and taking what is not given to him.\n\n13 13-15. Let him live forty-eight years as a student for the (four) Vedas,\n\n14\\. Or twelve years for each Veda,\n\n15\\. Or until he has learnt it.\n\n16\\. The garment (of a student) should be made of hemp, flax, or wool\n(accordingly as he is a Brahma _n_ a, a Kshatriya, or a Vai _s_ ya).\n\n17\\. The upper garment of a Brahma _n_ a should be an antelope-skin,\n\n18\\. That of a Ra _g_ anya the skin of a spotted deer,\n\np. 310\n\n19\\. That of a Vai _s_ ya a goat's or cow's skin.\n\n20\\. Or if (the prescribed sort of garment) is not to be had, a cow's hide\n(should be worn) by all, because to that belongs the first place (among all\nkinds of garments).\n\n21\\. The girdle of a Brahma _n_ a should be of Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass,\n\n22\\. That of a Kshatriya should be a bowstring,\n\n23\\. That of a Vai _s_ ya, made of Murva (i.e. Sanseveria Roxburghiana).\n\n24 24. If there is no Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a (or the other articles prescribed in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 22,\n23, the girdles should be made) of Ku _s_ a grass, of the plant A _s_ mantaka,\nor of Balba _g_ a grass (respectively).\n\n25\\. The staff of a Brahma _n_ a is of Pala _s_ a wood,\n\n26\\. That of a Ra _g_ anya of Bilva wood,\n\n27\\. That of a Vai _s_ ya of Udumbara wood.\n\n28\\. Or all (sorts of staffs may be used) by all.\n\n29\\. If the teacher calls him, he shall rise and then answer..\n\n30\\. If (the teacher calls him) while he is lying down, (he should answer)\nsitting; if sitting, standing; if standing, walking up (to the teacher); if\nwalking up, running up.\n\n31\\. If he behaves thus, his fame when he has become a Snataka (i.e. when he\nhas taken the bath at the end of his studentship) will be (such that people\nwill say of him), 'To-day he stays there; to-day he stays there.'\n\n32 32-35. There are three (kinds of) Snatakas: a Vidya-snataka (i.e. a Snataka\nby knowledge), a Vrata-snataka\n\np. 311\n\n[paragraph continues] (i.e. a Snataka by the completion of his vows), and a\nVidya-vrata-snataka (i.e. a Snataka both by knowledge and by the completion of\nhis vows).\n\n33\\. He who performs the Samavartana ceremony, after having finished the study\nof the Veda, but before the time of his vows has expired, is a Vidya-snataka.\n\n34\\. He who performs the Samavartana, after his vows have expired, but before\nhe has finished the study of the Veda, is a Vrata-snataka.\n\n35\\. He who performs the Samavartana, after having finished both, is a Vidya-\nvrata-snataka.\n\n36 36-40. Until the sixteenth year the time (for being initiated) has not\npassed for a Brahma _n_ a,\n\n37\\. Until the twenty-second for a Ra _g_ anya,\n\n38\\. Until the twenty-fourth for a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n39\\. After that (time has passed), they become patitasavitrika (or persons who\nhave lost the right of learning the Savitri).\n\n40\\. No one should initiate such men, nor teach them, nor perform sacrifices\nfor them, nor have intercourse with them.\n\n41 41. After the time has passed, (they should do) as has been prescribed.\n\n42 42. A person whose ancestors through three generations have been\npatitasavitrikas, is excluded\n\np. 312\n\nfrom the sacrament (of initiation) and from being taught the Veda.\n\n43 43. Of such persons those who desire to receive the sacrament, may perform\nthe sacrifice of Vratyastoma and then study the Veda, if they like. For (of\npersons who have done that) it is said, 'Intercourse with them is permitted.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[308:2-4](sbe29178.htm#fr_779) 5, 2-4. Comp. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 28 seqq.

XXII, 4, 28).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 6](sbe29179.htm)\n\n"
