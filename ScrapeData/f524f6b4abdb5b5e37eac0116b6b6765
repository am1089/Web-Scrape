(If it be said that the vidyas are separate) on account of the difference\n(of secondary matters), we deny that, since even in one and the same vidya\n(different secondary matters may find place).\n\nIn spite of the preceding argumentation we cannot admit that the different\ncognitions of Brahman are equally intimated by all Vedanta-texts, because we\nmeet with differences in secondary matters (gu _n_ a). Thus the Va _g_\nasaneyins mention in their text of the knowledge of the five fires a sixth\nfire ('And then the fire is indeed fire,' B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 14), while the\n_Kh_ andogas mention no sixth fire but conclude their text of the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\nagnividya with the express mention of five fires ('But he who thus knows the\nfive fires,' _Kh_. Up. V, 10, 10).\n\nNow it is impossible to admit that the cognition of those who admit that\nparticular qualification (i.e. the sixth fire) and of those who do not should\nbe one and the same. Nor may we attempt to evade the difficulty by saying that\nthe sixth fire may be tacitly included in the vidya of the _Kh_ andogas; for\nthat would contradict the number 'five' expressly stated by them.--In the\ncolloquy of the pra _n_ as\n\np. 188\n\nagain the _Kh_ andogas mention, in addition to the most important pra _n_ a,\nfour other pra _n_ as, viz. speech, the eye, the ear, and the mind; while the\nVa _g_ asaneyins mention a fifth one also, 'Seed indeed is generation. He who\nknows that becomes rich in offspring and cattle' (B _ri_. Up. VI, 1, 6).--Now\na difference of procedure in the point of addition and omission effects a\ndifference in the object known, and the latter again effects a difference in\nthe vidya, just as a difference in the point of material and divinity\ndistinguishes one sacrifice from another.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--Your objection is without force, since\nsuch differences of qualification as are met with in the above instances are\npossible even in one and the same vidya. In the _Kh_ andogya-text a sixth fire\nis indeed not included; yet, as five fires, beginning with the heavenly world,\nare recognised as the same in both texts the mentioned difference cannot\neffect a split of the vidya; not any more than the atiratra-sacrifice is\ndifferentiated by the sho _d_ a _s_ in-rite being either used or not-used.\nMoreover, the _Kh_ andogya-text also actually mentions a sixth fire, viz. in\nthe passage, V, 9, 2, 'When he has departed, his friends carry him, as\nappointed, to the fire'. The Va _g_ asaneyins, on the other hand, mention\ntheir sixth fire ('and then the fire is indeed fire, the fuel fuel,' &c.) for\nthe purpose of cutting short the fanciful assumption regarding fuel, smoke,\nand so on, which runs through the description of the five fires with which the\nheavenly world and so on are imaginatively identified. Their statement\nregarding the sixth fire (has therefore not the purpose of enjoining it as an\nobject of meditation but) is merely a remark about something already\nestablished (known) 1. And even if we assume that the statement about the\nsixth fire has the purpose of representing that fire as an object of devout\nmeditation, yet the fire may be inserted in the vidya of the _Kh_ andogas\nwithout any fear of its being in conflict with the number five mentioned\nthere;\n\np. 189\n\nfor that number is not an essential part of the injunction 1, but merely makes\nan additional statement regarding something known already from the text, viz.\nthe five fires with which the heavenly world and so on are identified 2.\nSimilarly nothing stands in the way of some additional qualification being\nincluded in the vidya concerning the colloquy of the pra _n_ as and so on. The\naddition or omission of some particular qualification is unable to introduce\ndifference into the object of knowledge and thereby into the knowledge itself;\nfor although the objects of knowledge may differ partly, yet their greater\npart and at the same time the knowing person are understood to be the same.\nHence the vidya also remains the same.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[188:1](sbe38145.htm#fr_125) Viz. the real fire in which the dead body is\nburned and which is known from perception.\n\n[189:1](sbe38145.htm#fr_126) I.e. the _Kh_ andogya-text contains no injunction\nthat five fires only are to be meditated upon.\n\n[189:2](sbe38145.htm#fr_127) So that there stands nothing in the way of our\namplifying our meditation by the addition of a sixth fire.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 3](sbe38146.htm)\n\n"
