The fact is, I had\nno time to think about myself. My days and nights were passing in a whirl,\nlike an eddy with myself in the centre. No gap was left for hesitation or\ndelicacy to enter.\n\nOne day my sister-in-law remarked to my husband: "Up to now the women of this\nhouse have been kept weeping. Here comes the men\'s turn.\n\n"We must see that they do not miss it," she continued, turning to me. "I see\nyou are out for the fray, Chota  12 Rani! Hurl your shafts straight at their\nhearts."\n\nHer keen eyes looked me up and down. Not one of the colours into which my\ntoilet, my dress, my manners, my speech, had blossomed out had escaped her. I\nam ashamed to speak of it today, but I felt no shame then. Something within me\nwas at work of which I was not even conscious. I used to overdress, it is\ntrue, but more like an automaton, with no particular design. No doubt I knew\nwhich effort of mine would prove specially pleasing to Sandip Babu, but that\nrequired no intuition, for he would discuss it openly before all of them.\n\nOne day he said to my husband: "Do you know, Nikhil, when I first saw our\nQueen Bee, she was sitting there so demurely in her gold- bordered _sari_. Her\neyes were gazing inquiringly into space, like stars which had lost their way,\njust as if she had been for ages standing on the edge of some darkness,\nlooking out for something unknown. But when I saw her, I felt a quiver run\nthrough me. It seemed to me that the gold border of her _sari_ was her own\ninner fire flaming out and twining round her. That is the flame we want,\nvisible fire! Look here, Queen Bee, you really must do us the favour of\ndressing once more as a living flame."\n\nSo long I had been like a small river at the border of a village. My rhythm\nand my language were different from what they are now. But the tide came up\nfrom the sea, and my breast heaved; my banks gave way and the great drumbeats\nof the sea waves echoed in my mad current. I could not understand the meaning\nof that sound in my blood. Where was that former self of mine? Whence came\nfoaming into me this surging flood of glory? Sandip\'s hungry eyes burnt like\nthe lamps of worship before my shrine. All his gaze proclaimed that I was a\nwonder in beauty and power; and the loudness of his praise, spoken and\nunspoken, drowned all other voices in my world. Had the Creator created me\nafresh, I wondered? Did he wish to make up now for neglecting me so long? I\nwho before was plain had become suddenly beautiful. I who before had been of\nno account now felt in myself all the splendour of Bengal itself.\n\nFor Sandip Babu was not a mere individual. In him was the confluence of\nmillions of minds of the country. When he called me the Queen Bee of the hive,\nI was acclaimed with a chorus of praise by all our patriot workers. After\nthat, the loud jests of my sister-in-law could not touch me any longer. My\nrelations with all the world underwent a change. Sandip Babu made it clear how\nall the country was in need of me. I had no difficulty in believing this at\nthe time, for I felt that I had the power to do everything. Divine strength\nhad come to me. It was something which I had never felt before, which was\nbeyond myself. I had no time to question it to find out what was its nature.\nIt seemed to belong to me, and yet to transcend me. It comprehended the whole\nof Bengal.\n\nSandip Babu would consult me about every little thing touching the Cause. At\nfirst I felt very awkward and would hang back, but that soon wore off.\nWhatever I suggested seemed to astonish him. He would go into raptures and\nsay: "Men can only think. You women have a way of understanding without\nthinking. Woman was created out of God\'s own fancy. Man, He had to hammer into\nshape."\n\nLetters used to come to Sandip Babu from all parts of the country which were\nsubmitted to me for my opinion. Occasionally he disagreed with me. But I would\nnot argue with him. Then after a day or two--as if a new light had suddenly\ndawned upon him--he would send for me and say: "It was my mistake. Your\nsuggestion was the correct one." He would often confess to me that wherever he\nhad taken steps contrary to my advice he had gone wrong. Thus I gradually came\nto be convinced that behind whatever was taking place was Sandip Babu, and\nbehind Sandip Babu was the plain common sense of a woman. The glory of a great\nresponsibility filled my being.\n\nMy husband had no place in our counsels. Sandip Babu treated him as a younger\nbrother, of whom personally one may be very fond and yet have no use for his\nbusiness advice. He would tenderly and smilingly talk about my husband\'s\nchildlike innocence, saying that his curious doctrine and perversities of mind\nhad a flavour of humour which made them all the more lovable. It was seemingly\nthis very affection for Nikhil which led Sandip Babu to forbear from troubling\nhim with the burden of the country.\n\nNature has many anodynes in her pharmacy, which she secretly administers when\nvital relations are being insidiously severed, so that none may know of the\noperation, till at last one awakes to know what a great rent has been made.\nWhen the knife was busy with my life\'s most intimate tie, my mind was so\nclouded with fumes of intoxicating gas that I was not in the least aware of\nwhat a cruel thing was happening. Possibly this is woman\'s nature. When her\npassion is roused she loses her sensibility for all that is outside it. When,\nlike the river, we women keep to our banks, we give nourishment with all that\nwe have: when we overflow them we destroy with all that we are.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[12](hw09.htm#fr_11) Bimala. the younger brother\'s wife, was the _Chota_ or\nJunior Rani.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II](hw10.htm)\n\n'
