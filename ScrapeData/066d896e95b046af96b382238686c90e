He offers a full-offering 1; for the full means the All: \'May I be\nconsecrated after encompassing the All!\' thus he thinks. At this (offering) he\nbestows a boon; for a boon means all: \'Having encompassed the All (the\nuniverse), may I be consecrated! thus he thinks. He may perform this offering,\nif he chooses; or, if he chooses, he may disregard it.\n\n5:2:3:22\\. And on the following day he prepares a cake on eight potsherds, as\nsacrificial food for Anumati 2. And whatever portion of (the grains) being\nground,--either flour or rice-grains,--falls down behind the pin, that he\nthrows together into the dipping-spoon\n\np. 43\n\n[paragraph continues] (sruva) 1. They take a firebrand from the Anvaharyapa\n_k_ ana (or southern) fire, and therewith go southward. And where he finds a\nself-produced hollow 2 or cleft,--\n\n5:2:3:33\\. Having there made up a fire, he offers with (Va _g_. S. IX, 35),\n\'This, O Nir _ri_ ti, is thy portion: accept it graciously, hail!\' For Nir\n_ri_ ti is this (Earth); whomsoever she seizes upon with evil, him she seizes\nupon with destruction (nir _ri_ ti): hence whatever part of this (Earth) is of\nthe Nir _ri_ ti nature, that he thereby propitiates; and thus Nir _ri_ ti does\nnot seize upon him, while being consecrated. And the reason why he offers in a\nself-produced hollow or\n\np. 44\n\ncleft, is that that much of this (earth) is possessed with Nir _ri_ ti.\n\n5:2:3:44\\. They then return (to the sacrificial ground) without looking\nbackward. He now proceeds with the cake on eight potsherds for Anumati. For\nAnumati is this (Earth); and whosoever knows to do that work which he intends\nto do, for him indeed she approves (arm-man) thereof: hence it is her he\nthereby pleases, thinking \'May I be consecrated, approved by that (genius of)\napproval!\'\n\n5:2:3:55\\. And as to why it is a (cake) on eight potsherds,--the Gayatri\nconsists of eight syllables, and this earth is Gayatri. And as to why he\noffers of the same sacrificial food 1 both (oblations): thereby, indeed, both\nof it comes to be this latter one (viz. Anumati, or approval). A garment is\nthe sacrificial fee for this (offering): for even as one clad in a garment\ndoes not venture into the forest, but having deposited that garment\n(somewhere) escapes (robbers), in like manner no assault befalls him while\nbeing consecrated.\n\n5:2:3:66\\. And on the following day he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for\nAgni and Vish _n_ u, and offers it in the same way as the (regular) ish _t_ i:\nthis indeed is just what that approved initiation-offering to Agni and Vish\n_n_ u is there 2. Now Agni is all the deities, since in Agni one offers to all\ndeities; and Agni forsooth is the lower end, and Vish _n_ u is the upper end:\n\'May I be consecrated, after thus encompassing all the deities, and after\nencompassing\n\np. 45\n\nthe whole sacrifice!\' thus he thinks, and hence there is a cake on eleven\npotsherds to Agni and Vish _n_ u. Gold is the sacrificial fee for this\n(offering); for to Agni belongs this sacrifice, and gold is Agni\'s seed. As to\nVish _n_ u, he is the sacrifice, and Agni forsooth is the sacrifice:\nnevertheless this is Agni\'s alone, therefore gold is the fee.\n\n5:2:3:77\\. And on the following day he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for\nAgni and Soma, and offers it in the same way as an (ordinary) ish _t_ i, for\nit was thereby Indra slew V _ri_ tra, and thereby he gained that universal\nconquest which now is his. And in like manner does this (king, the Sacrificer)\nthereby slay his wicked, hateful enemy, and in like manner does he gain the\nvictory. \'May I be consecrated, when safety and security from evil-doers have\nbeen gained!\' thus. he thinks: hence there is a cake on eleven potsherds for\nAgni and Soma. For this (offering) a bull set at liberty is the sacrificial\nfee; for yonder moon 1 they slay while setting him at liberty 2: to wit, by\nthe full-moon offering they slay him, and by the new-moon offering they set\nhim at liberty;--therefore a bull set at liberty is the fee.\n\n5:2:3:88\\. And on the following day he prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for\nIndra and Agni, and offers it in the same way as an (ordinary) ish _t_ i. Now\nwhen\n\np. 46\n\n[paragraph continues] Indra slew V _ri_ tra, that vigour and energy of his\nwent out of him, being frightened: by this offering he again possessed himself\nof that vigour and energy. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by this\noffering possess himself of vigour and energy; for Agni is fiery spirit, and\nIndra is vigour and energy: \'May I be consecrated, having embraced both these\nenergies!\' thus he thinks: hence there is a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra\nand Agni. A bull is the fee for this (offering), for by his shoulder he is of\nAgni\'s nature 1, and by his testicles he is of Indra\'s nature: therefore a\nbull is the fee for it.\n\n5:2:3:99\\. Thereupon he performs the offering of first-fruits 2; for verily he\nwho performs the Ra _g_ asuya secures for himself (the benefits of) all\nsacrificial rites, all ish _t_ is, even the spoon-offerings; and instituted by\nthe gods, in truth, is that ish _t_ i, the \xc3\x82graya _n_ esh _t_ i: \'May this\nalso be offered by me! May I be consecrated by this (offering) also!\' thus he\nthinks, and therefore he performs the offering of first-fruits. Moreover, it\nis for the plants that he who is consecrated, is consecrated; therefore he now\nmakes the plants healthy and faultless, thinking, \'May I be consecrated for\n(the obtainment of) healthy, faultless plants (crops)!\' A cow is the fee for\nthis (offering).\n\n5:2:3:1010\\. Thereupon he performs the Seasonal offerings 3; for verily he who\nperforms the Ra _g_ asuya secures for himself (the benefits of) all\nsacrificial\n\np. 47\n\nrites, all ish _t_ is, even the spoon-offerings; and instituted by the gods,\nin truth, is that sacrificial rite, the Seasonal offerings: \'May these also be\noffered by me! May I be consecrated by these (offerings) also!\' thus he\nthinks, and therefore he performs the Seasonal offerings.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[42:1](sbe4110.htm#fr_98) On the pur _n_ ahuti, or libation of a spoonful of\nghee, see part i, p. 302 note. According to Katy. _S_ r. XV, 1, 4 seq. \xc3\x82 _s_\nv. _S_ r. IX, 3, 2, and other authorities, this full-offering is preceded by\nthe Pavitra (purificatory ceremony), a Soma-sacrifice with four dikshas or\ninitiation days (? commencing on the first day of the bright fortnight of\nPhalguna), serving as the ordinary opening offering (anvarambha _n_ iyesh _t_\ni). That it formed part of the ceremonial .at the time of the composition of\nthe Brahma _n_ a there can be little doubt (cf. Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ av. Br. 18, 8. 1),\nbut as it is an ordinary Agnish _t_ oma, the author had no reason to refer to\nit.\n\n[42:2](sbe4110.htm#fr_99) I. e. the approval or favour of the deities,\npersonified,--According to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ika Deva (to Katy. _S_ r. XV, 1, 8), the\nceremonies now beginning would commence on the 10th day of the bright half of\nPhalguni: the fifth day\'s ceremony from this day, viz. the first of the four\nseasonal offerings, having to be performed on the Full-moon of that month; see\np. 47, note [1](sbe4111.htm#fn_109).\n\n[43:1](sbe4110.htm#fr_100) The authorities of the Black Ya _g_ us prepare\ntherewith a cake on one kapala. Taitt. S. I, 8, 1.\n\n[43:2](sbe4110.htm#fr_101) Saya _n_ a, perhaps rightly, takes \'iri _n_ a\' here\n(and on Taitt. S. vol. ii, p. 6) in the sense of \'ushara,\' a spot of barren\n(or saline) soil. Cf. VII, 2; 1, 8: \'In whatever part of this (earth) there is\nproduced (of itself) a cleft, or in whatever part of it plants are not\nproduced, verily that part of it Nir _ri_ ti seizes upon.\'--Kau _s_ ika-sutra\nXIII, 28 (A. Weber, Omina and Portenta, p. 386) recommends the following\npropitiatory rites in case of a sudden cleft in the ground: \'If in the\nvillage, or house, or fire-house, or meeting-place, (the ground) should burst\nopen, four cows are got ready, a white, a black, a red, and a one-coloured\none. For twelve days he puts down the butter, milked together from these. In\nthe morning of the twelfth, having made up a fire north of where there was\nthat cleft, having swept and sprinkled it, and strewn sacrificial grass around\nit; and having mixed (the butter) with ghee from the white (cow), and\naddressed it (the spot) with the three verses, Ath.-veda XII, x, 19-21 ("Agni\nis in the earth, in the plants, the waters carry Agni, Agni is in the flints,\nAgni is within men; in cows, in horses are Agnis," &c.), and touched it, let\nhim then offer. In the same way on the south side; in the same way on the\nwestern side. Having concluded on the north side, let him offer with the\n(formulas addressed) to Vastoshpati (the tutelary genius of the dwelling).\nHaving poured the refuse in the cleft, and completed the oblations, he\nsprinkles the cleft with lustral water.\'\n\n[44:1](sbe4110.htm#fr_102) Though he has offered twice (to Nir _ri_ ti and\nAnumati), he has only once taken out rice for oblation.\n\n[44:2](sbe4110.htm#fr_103) Viz. at the ordinary Soma-sacrifice; for the Diksha\n_n_ iyesh _t_ i, see part ii, p. 22.\n\n[45:1](sbe4110.htm#fr_104) On the identification of V _ri_ tra with the moon\n(and Soma), see I, 6, 3, 27. On the moon serving as food to the gods, see part\nii, Introduction, p. xiii. According to a later conception, one kala (or\nsixteenth part of the moon\'s disc) was taken off each day during the period of\nthe waning, and again added to it during the period of the waxing moon.\n\n[45:2](sbe4110.htm#fr_105) Utsar _g_ am . . . ghnanti; perhaps the former has\nto be taken here as infinitive (in order to set him at liberty) rather than as\ngerund.\n\n[46:1](sbe4110.htm#fr_106) Cp. I, 1, 2, 9, \'(Like) fire, verily, is the yoke\nof that cart: hence the shoulder of those (oxen) that draw it becomes as if\nburnt by fire.\'\n\n[46:2](sbe4110.htm#fr_107) For the \xc3\x82graya _n_ esh _t_ i, see part i, p. 369\nseq.\n\n[46:3](sbe4110.htm#fr_108) For the four _K_ aturmasya (enumerated in the next\nchapter), see part i, p. 383 seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 2, 4.
