The life and character of each of these\nwere as wonderful, superhuman, and divine as were those of the illustrious Son\nof Man. Each has been like the embodiment of all Divine attributes; each has\nbeen the giver of new life to the old spiritual truths, and the generator of\nthat tidal wave of spirituality which has again and again inundated the\nreligious world, surmounting the\n\np. 2\n\nbarriers of superstition and prejudice and carrying the stream of individual\nsouls toward the ocean of Divinity.\n\nThe present upheaval of the spiritual tide, the waves of which, traversing\nnearly half the world, have touched the shores of America, was produced by the\nChristlike character and Divine personality of Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna--\nrevered and worshipped in India to-day as an ideal manifestation of the Divine\nglory. His life was so extraordinary and unparalleled that within ten years\nafter His departure from earth it aroused the admiration, wonder and reverence\nnot only of all classes of people in His own country, but of many\ndistinguished English and German scholars of the nineteenth century.\n\nLife of Sri Ramakrishna by European Scholars.A short account of the life of\nBhagavan Sri Ramakrishna appeared for the first time in the January number of\nthe "Imperial and Quarterly Review" of 1896 under the title of "A Modern Hindu\nSaint." It was an able article penned by Prof. C. H. Tawney, who was for many\nyears the professor of Sanskrit in Calcutta University and the distinguished\nLibrarian of India House in London. This article excited the interest of many\n\np. 3\n\n[paragraph continues] European scholars, among whom Professor Max Muller\nshowed his appreciation by publishing in the August number of the "Nineteenth\nCentury" of 1896 a short sketch of this Hindu Saint\'s life entitled "A Real\nMahatman." In this celebrated article, which was for some time the subject of\nmost severe criticism both in England and India among many of the Christian\nmissionaries and the Theosophists, the noted Professor showed the difference\nbetween the imaginary Mahatmas of the Theosophists and the Real Mahatman or\nthe Great Soul of India who had reached God-consciousness and had manifested\nDivinity in all the actions of His daily life. He gave a brief account of the\nextraordinary life of Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna, paying Him the highest tribute\nof honor and respect that a Christian scholar could give to a Divine\nmanifestation in the so-called heathen land. Later, in 1898, he compiled and\npublished "Ramakrishna, His Life and Sayings," collecting more facts of His\nlife and the sayings of this exemplary character perfumed with Divine\npersonality.\n\nProfessor Max Muller was deeply impressed by the originality of this great\nSaint and real Mahatman, who was not brought up within the\n\np. 4\n\nRamakrishna a real Mahatman.precincts of any university and who drew the water\nof His wisdom neither from any book nor Scripture nor from any ancient prophet\nbut directly from the eternal Fountainhead of all Knowledge and Wisdom. He was\nalso struck by the broad, liberal and absolutely unsectarian spirit which\npervades the utterings of Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna. Indeed the life and\nsavings of the Bhagavan have given a death-blow to the sectarian bigotry and\nfanaticism of the so-called religious world. Whosoever has read His Sayings is\nimpressed with the universality of His spiritual ideals which embraced the\nideals of all mankind.\n\nFrom His childhood Sri Ramakrishna fought against all sectarian doctrines and\ndogmas, but yet at the same time He showed that all sects and creeds were but\nthe paths which lead sincere and earnest souls to the one universal goal of\nall religions. Having realized the highest ideal of every religion by\nfollowing the methods and practices of the various sects and creeds of the\nworld, Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna gave to humanity whatever spiritual experience\nand realization He had acquired. Every idea which He gave was fresh from above\nand unadulterated\n\np. 5\n\nby the product of human intellect, culture or scholastic education. Each step\nof His life from babyhood to the last moment was extraordinary. Every stage\nwas like the unfoldment of a chapter of a new scripture especially written out\nby the Unseen Hand to fit the minds of the East and the West and to fulfil the\nspiritual needs of the twentieth century.\n\nBhagavan Sri Ramakrishna is not only the greatest saint of modern India but He\nis the "Real Mahatman." A real Mahatman as described in the Bhagavad Gita\n(Chapter VII, verse 19) is one who, having realized the Absolute, perceives\nthe Divine Being in all animate and inanimate objects of the universe. His\nheart and soul never turn away from God. He lives in God-consciousness, and\nDivine qualities constantly flow through his soul. He cares neither for fame\nnor power nor worldly prosperity. A true Mahatman has no attachment to His\nbody or to sense-pleasures; He is a living God; He is absolutely free and His\ninner nature is illumined by the self-effulgent light of Divine wisdom and His\nheart is overflowing with Divine Love. His soul becomes the playground of the\nAlmighty, His body and mind become the instrument of the Divine will. And\nBhagavan\n\np. 6\n\n[paragraph continues] Sri Ramakrishna was such a real Mahatman.\n\nEven in this age when the vast majority of educated people do not believe in\nthe existence of God and of the human soul, when scientific knowledge has\nturned the minds of students away from the path of spirituality, when sense\npleasures and the luxuries of life have become the ideals of earthly existence\nand human beings have degenerated into money-making machines, we have\nwitnessed with our eyes a Great Soul who is recognized as a Real Mahatman by\nhundreds and thousands of thoughtful men and women of India, Europe and\nAmerica. This Great Soul manifested His Divine qualities and lived in God-\nconsciousness at every moment of His earthly career, and to-day thousands of\npeople prostrate before His picture and, worship Him as the latest\nmanifestation of Divinity. Whosoever has heard of His most wonderful life has\nfelt in his soul that Ramakrishna was the perfect Ideal of mankind.\n\nHe made His appearance in an obscure part of Bengal where He passed His early\nboyhood, but His youth and maturity were spent near Calcutta, the capital of\nBritish India, as cosmopolitan a city as London, New York,\n\np. 7\n\nRamakrishna\'s influence upon the mind of Scholars.or any other large city of\nthe civilized world and the seat of education, refinement and scientific\nknowledge. He allowed the sceptical minds of the students and professors of\ncolleges and universities as well as of educated men and women of the world to\ncome in direct touch with the self-effulgent light of Divine wisdom which was\nshining in its full glory through His childlike, soft, and tender form.\nScholars and intelligent people of all classes poured from every quarter to\nthat spot which was sanctified by the presence of the Bhagavan. He was the\nliving example of the spiritual greatness and Divinity which had been\nmanifested by the great Incarnations like Christ, Buddha, Krishna, Rama,\nChaitanya * and other Saviours of the world.\n\nWe know a number of sceptics and agnostics who had never believed in Christ or\nBuddha or Krishna as Divine Incarnations, who had never accepted the authority\nof the Scriptures, but on\n\np. 8\n\nthe contrary had maintained that the lives of Christ and of other Saviours\nwere but exaggerated accounts based upon the imagination of their disciples,\nanxious to deify their human masters--such sceptics and unbelievers when they\nmet Ramakrishna and watched His superhuman life, were convinced that the lives\nof Christ, Buddha, Krishna, and other Avataras must have been true and real.\nThe same sceptics, when they beheld His Divine powers, were so deeply\nimpressed with His personality that they prostrated before Him, kissed the\ndust of His holy feet and realized that He was the Personification of the\nSermon on the Mount, the Incarnation of Divinity on earth, and the\nremanifestation of Christ, Buddha, Krishna, and Chaitanya in one form. All the\nspecial qualities and Divine powers that had adorned the wonderful character\nof each of these great personages were witnessed by them in this uncommon\nDivine manifestation of the nineteenth century.\n\nHave we not watched with admiration when the followers of all the great\nreligions of the world recognized in Sri Ramakrishna their Divine Ideals? Have\nwe not seen how Quakers and orthodox Christians knelt and prayed before\n\np. 9\n\nRamakrishna as the Divine  Ideal of all Sects.[paragraph continues] Him and\nworshipped Him as the Christ when the Bhagavan went into superconscious\ncommunion with the Heavenly Father after hearing the holy name of Jesus of\nNazareth? The Mahometan saints who came to see Him, prostrated at His holy\nfeet and recognized in Him the highest Ideal of Islam. The Buddhists regarded\nHim as Sambuddha, the Enlightened. The followers of Chaitanya, like Vaishnava\nCharan, * and others, worshipped Him as the second Prophet of Nuddea when\nBhagavan Sri Ramakrishna occupied the altar which was reverentially dedicated\nto Sri Chaitanya by hundreds of devoted Vaishnavas, who always prostrated\nbefore that altar and prayed to their Lord Guaranga. The worshippers of\nKrishna called Him the Incarnation of Krishna. The devotees of the Divine\nMother realized that the Mother of the universe was playing through Him; the\nfollowers of Shiva declared that Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna was their living\nDeity; while the Sikhs, the faithful votaries of Guru Nanaka, \xe2\x80\xa0\n\np. 10\n\nregarded Him as their Holy Master. His followers, seeing all these powers,\nmarvelled at His greatness and believed that His many-sided personality was\nthe living example and the consummation of all the previous Avataras and\nDivine manifestations. And the truth of this was again and again verified and\nconfirmed by His acts as well as by His own words: "He who was Krishna, Rama,\nChrist, Buddha, Chaitanya has _now_ become Ramakrishna." Bhagavan was always\nconscious of this truth and spoke of it before the world as well as before His\ndearest disciples.\n\nHis mission.As His Divine personality was many-sided yet one, so was His great\nmission. It was to show the underlying unity in the variety of religions and\nto establish that universal religion of which sectarian religions are each but\npartial expressions. Like all other Saviours the life of the Bhagavan\nexemplified His mission. He spent the best part of His life in practising in\nfull the different\n\np. 11\n\nmethods of Yoga. He went through every minute detail of the devotional\nexercises and different forms of worship ordained by the Scriptures of\ndifferent nations and practised by the followers of the various sects and\ncreeds of the world. His object in devoting so much time to these practices\nwas to find out whether they had any real value in the path which leads to\nperfection.\n\nRamakrishna\'s mind was always open to Truth. He would not accept anything on\nsecond-hand authority. He would not believe in anything because it was written\nin a book or because it was declared by some great personage. He must know the\nTruth first hand. Before accepting any statement, He must realize it in His\nown life and then He would speak of His personal experience to others in order\nthat they might gain benefit from it. For nearly twelve years before He\nappeared in public or made any disciples Sri Ramakrishna, like a scientific\ninvestigator, inquired into the beliefs of the various sects of every\nreligion, followed their methods and performed their rituals and ceremonies\nwith perfect faith and earnest devotion that He might realize the goal which\ncould be reached by each of them. To His great\n\np. 12\n\nsurprise, however, He discovered that He arrived at God-consciousness through\neach sectarian method. Whenever, furthermore, He desired to follow any\nparticular path, there came to Him a perfected soul of each sect who had\nrealized the Ideal, to direct Him in that path. Everyone of these great saints\nrecognized in Sri Ramakrishna the manifestation of Divine powers, when in a\nshort time He attained to that which they had not been able to acquire during\nyears of austerity, worship and extreme devotion.\n\nHaving finished His investigations, He was ready to proclaim His message and\ngive to the world the fruits of His own experience and realization. But unlike\nother spiritual teachers, He did not go out in search after His disciples and\nfollowers. As a fragrant flower does not hunt for bees but waits patiently for\nthe bees to come, so the full-blown flower of spirituality in the form of Sri\nRamakrishna waited for His disciples to come to Him in the Temple garden at\nDakshineswara on the bank of the Ganges.\n\nWhen Ramakrishna had attained to the highest ideal of each Yoga and had\nrealized the spiritual oneness with the Absolute Brahman and the Mother of the\nuniverse, rumor spread from mouth to mouth that Ramakrishna had\n\np. 13\n\nreached perfection in this life. People from all quarters began to crowd\naround Him. Pandits and scholars of every nationality as well as hundreds of\ndevout men and women of all sects came to see Him and listen to His original\nand wonderful teachings. This was the beginning of His public life as\nspiritual leader and guide, which continued for nearly sixteen years. During\nthis period He did nothing but help mankind by freely distributing the\npriceless jewels of spiritual truths which he had earned through such\nstruggle, hardship and austerities.\n\nHis  spiritual insight.Ramakrishna had a marvellous intellect and keen insight\ninto the true nature of things and events, and using the commonest occurrences\nof every-day life as illustrations, He succeeded in making the dull minds of\nworldly people grasp the spiritual depth, beauty and grandeur of His sublime\nideals. He poured new life into every word that He uttered so as to touch the\nsoul of His hearers. People listened with wonder and admiration to His\noriginal discourses on the most difficult problems concerning life and death,\nthe nature and origin of the soul, the origin of the universe and our relation\nto God.\n\nIn this age of scientific rationalism Bhagavan\n\np. 14\n\nRealization of God.[paragraph continues] Sri Ramakrishna has shown to the\nworld how the Lord of the universe can be realized and attained in this life,\nand no one except Him has ventured to go through all the tests of sceptics and\nagnostics to prove that He had attained to God-consciousness. Those who have\nseen Him, lived with Him for years and watched Him by day and by night, have\nproclaimed before the world that He was the embodiment of the highest\nspiritual ideals of all nations, and that whoever worships Him with faith and\nreverence worships the latest manifestation of Divinity.\n\nThe Bhagavan proved by His example that wherever there is extreme longing to\nsee God, there is the nearness of the realization of the absolute Truth. His\nlife has given to the world a grand demonstration that even in this age\nDivinity can be reached and Divine perfection can be acquired by one who is\npure, chaste, simple and whose devotion is whole-hearted and whole-souled. We\nhave neither seen nor heard of a character purer, simpler, more chaste, more\ntruthful and more godly than that of this ideal Mahatman. He was like the\npersonification of purity and chastity and the embodiment of truthfulness.\n\np. 15\n\nHis life was the life of absolute renunciation. Earthly pleasures and comforts\nmeant nothing to Him. The only pleasure, comfort or happiness which He cared\nfor was the blissful state of Samadhi or God-consciousness, when His soul,\nliberated from the bondage of body and mind, soared high in the infinite space\nof the Absolute. This Samadhi was a natural state with Ramakrishna. He never\nhad to make a special effort to attain it. We often heard Him say that when He\nwas four years old He went into Samadhi at the sight of the beautiful coloring\nof a tropical cloud. This realization He always remembered and often described\nin His conversation. And as He grew older His Samadhi or ecstasy became\nstronger and deeper.\n\nHis Samadhi.In His Samadhi His body would become absolutely motionless, His\npulse and heart-beat imperceptible, His eyes would be half open and if anyone\npressed His eyeball with the finger, His body would not move or show the least\nsign of sensation. He would remain in this state sometimes for a few minutes,\nsometimes for half an hour or an hour, and on one occasion He continued in it\nfor three days and nights. Then He would come down on the plane of sense-\nconsciousness and relate His\n\np. 16\n\nexperiences. He had the power to separate Himself from the cage of the\nphysical organism and to go into this state of Divine communion at His will\nand stay there as long as He wished. Frequently He told us that He reached\nsuch a height in Samadhi that if He had been like an ordinary mortal He could\nnever have returned to His body; that no mortal had ever come back from that\nkind of Samadhi; and that the Divine Mother gave Him this power to return to\nthis plane simply to help mankind and to establish His mission.\n\nHis renunciation.To Him God was father, mother, brother, sister, and\neverything. He recognized no earthly relations. He never coveted wealth, nor\nhad He any earthly possession. He realized that gold had no more value than\nearth and became absolutely unattached to riches, understanding the\ntransitoriness of the objects which can be acquired by wealth. He often said\nthat immortality could not be purchased by money, and emphasized by His\nexample the true meaning of the Vedic passage: "Neither by meritorious deed,\nnor by progeny, nor by wealth, but by renunciation alone the Immortal Truth\ncan be acquired." Renunciation of the attachment to worldly things is the\n\np. 17\n\ngate to God-consciousness. Christ, Buddha, Chaitanya, Sankaracharya and all\nother Saviours and spiritual leaders of the world exemplified this by living\nthe life of absolute renunciation. It is very rare to find in this age a\nperfect ideal of the renunciation of lust and of worldly attachment. Bhagavan\nSri Ramakrishna practised the ideal of the renunciation of riches to such an\nextent that He was able to make His body respond involuntarily to the touch of\ncoin by shrinking from it even in sound sleep. We have often seen Him suffer\npain when he was obliged to touch a coin of any metal. Who could be a more\nperfect ideal of renunciation in this age of materialism!\n\nHe uplifted womanhood.Sri Ramakrishna taught that every woman, old or young,\nwas the representative of the Divine Mother. He worshipped God as the Mother\nof the universe and frequently declared that His Divine Mother had shown Him\nthat all women represent Divine Motherhood on earth. For the first time in the\nreligious history of the world was this ideal preached by any Divine\nIncarnation. And upon this depends the salvation of men and especially of\nwomen of all countries from immorality, corruption and such other vices as\nprevail in a civilized community.\n\np. 18\n\nBy His living example the Bhagavan established the truth of spiritual marriage\non the soul plane even in this age of sensuality. He had a wife whom He always\ntreated with reverence and whom He regarded as the manifestation of His Divine\nMother. He never had any sex relation with her or with any woman on the\nphysical plane. His wife, the Blessed Virgin Sarada Devi, is still living like\nan embodiment of Holy Motherhood with innumerable spiritual children around\nHer. She in turn has always regarded the Bhagavan as Her Blessed Mother Divine\nin a human form. Up to the last moment of His earthly career the Bhagavan was\nabsolutely pure, chaste, and a perfect child of His Divine Mother of the\nuniverse. Furthermore, Ramakrishna uplifted the ideal of womanhood on the\nspiritual plane by accepting His first Guru or spiritual instructor in a woman\nform. No other Saviour or spiritual leader has ever given such an honor to\nwomanhood in the annals of religious history.\n\nHis mission.The mission of Bhagavan Sri [Ramakrishna](errata.htm#1) was to\nshow by His living example how a truly spiritual man, being dead to the world\nof senses, can live on the spiritual plane of God-consciousness; it was to\nprove\n\np. 19\n\nthat each individual soul is immortal and potentially Divine. His mission was\nto establish harmony between religious sects and creeds. For the first time it\nwas absolutely demonstrated by Ramakrishna that all religions are like so many\npaths leading to the same Goal, that the realization of the same Almighty\nBeing is the highest Ideal of Christianity, Mahometanism, Judaism,\nZoroastrianism, Hinduism, as well as of all other smaller religions of the\nworld. Sri Ramakrishna\'s mission was to proclaim the eternal Truth that God is\none but has many aspects, and that the same one is worshipped by different\nnations under various names and forms; that He is personal, impersonal and\nbeyond both; that He is with name and form and yet nameless and formless. His\nmission was to establish the worship of the Divine Mother and thus to elevate\nthe ideal of womanhood into Divine Motherhood. His mission was to show by His\nown example that true spirituality can be transmitted and that salvation can\nbe obtained through the grace of a Divine Incarnation. His mission was to\ndeclare before the world that psychic powers and the power of healing are\nobstacles in the path of the attainment of God-consciousness.\n\np. 20\n\nHis Divine powers.Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna possessed all the Yoga powers but\nHe seldom exercised those powers, especially the power of healing diseases.\nMoreover, He always prevented His disciples from either seeking or exercising\nthose powers. But one power which we have seen Him frequently exercise was the\nDivine power to transform the character of a sinner and to lift a worldly soul\nto the plane of superconsciousness by a single touch. He would take the sins\nof others upon His own shoulders and would purify them by transmitting His own\nspirituality and opening the spiritual eyes of His trite followers.\n\nThe days of prophecy have passed before our eyes. The manifestations of the\nDivine powers of One who is worshipped to-day by thousands as the latest\nIncarnation of Divinity, we have witnessed with our eyes. Blessed are they who\nhave seen Him and touched His holy feet. May the glory of Sri Ramakrishna be\nfelt by all nations of the earth; may His Divine power be manifested in the\nearnest and sincere souls of His devotees of all countries in all ages to\ncome, is the prayer of His child and servant,\n\nAbhedananda.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[7:*](gork03.htm#fr_1) Chaitanya, the Founder of a sect of the Vaishnavas, is\nregarded in India as the Incarnation of Krishna.
