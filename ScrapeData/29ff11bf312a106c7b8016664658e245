The sky watches over you when you\nsleep in your mother's arms, and the morning comes tiptoe to your bed and\nkisses your eyes.\n\nThe wind carries away in glee the tinkling of your anklet bells.\n\nThe fairy mistress of dreams is coming towards you, flying through the\ntwilight sky.\n\nThe world-mother keeps her seat by you in your mother's heart.\n\nHe who plays his music to the stars is standing at your window with his flute.\n\nAnd the fairy mistress of dreams is coming towards you, flying through the\ntwilight sky.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sleep-Stealer](cm08.htm)\n\n"
