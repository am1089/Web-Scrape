What  \nGod shall we adore with our oblation?  \n14 May powers auspicious come to us from every side, never  \ndeceived, unhindered and victorious,  \nThat the Gods ever may be with us for our gain, our guardians  \nday by day, unceasing in their care.  \n15 May the auspicious favour of the Gods be ours, on us  \ndescend the bounty of the righteous Gods.  \nThe friendship of the Gods have we devoutly sought: so  \nmay the Gods extend our life that we may live.\n\np. 227\n\n16 We call them hither with a hymn of olden time, Bhaga, the  \nfriendly Daksha, Mitra, Aditi,  \nAryaman, Varuna, Soma, the Asvins. May Sarasvati, auspicious,  \ngrant felicity.  \n17 May the Wind waft to us that pleasant medicine, may Earth  \nour Mother give it, and our Father Heaven,  \nAnd the joy-giving stones that press the Soma's juice. Asvins,  \nmay ye, for whom our spirits long, hear this.  \n18 Him we invoke for aid who reigns supreme, the Lord of all  \nthat stands or moves, inspirer of the soul,  \nThat Pushan may promote the increase of our wealth, our  \nkeeper and our guard infallible for our good.  \n19 Illustrious far and wide, may Indra prosper us: may Pushan  \nprosper us, the Master of all wealth.  \nMay Tarkshya with uninjured fellies prosper us: Brihaspati  \nvouchsafe to us prosperity.  \n20 The Maruts, Sons of Prisni, borne by spotted steeds, moving  \nin glory, oft visiting holy rites,  \nSages whose tongue is Agni and their eyes the Sun,\xc2\x97\xc2\x97hither  \nlet all the Gods for our protection come.  \n21 Gods, may we with our ears listen to what is good, and with  \nour eyes see what is good, ye Holy Ones.  \nWith limbs and bodies firm may we extolling you attain the  \nterm of life appointed by the Gods.  \n22 A hundred autumns stand before us, O ye Gods, within  \nwhose space ye bring our bodies to decay;  \nWithin whose space our sons become fathers in turn. Break  \nye not in the midst our course of fleeting life.  \n23 Aditi is the heaven, Aditi is mid-air, Aditi is the Mother  \nand the Sire and Son.\n\np. 228\n\nAditi is all Gods, Aditi five-classed men, Aditi all that hath  \nbeen born and shall be born.  \n24 Slight us not Varuna, Aryaman, or Mitra, Ribhukshan,  \nIndra, \xc3\x82yu, or the Maruts,  \nWhen we declare amid the congregation the virtues of the  \nStrong Steed, God-descended.  \n25 What time they bear before the Courser, covered with  \ntrappings and with wealth, the grasped oblation,  \nThe dappled goat goeth straightforward, bleating, to the  \nplace dear to Indra and to Pushan.  \n26 Dear to all Gods, this goat, the share of Pushan, is first led  \nforward with the vigorous Courser,  \nWhile Tvashtar sends him forward with the Charger, acceptable  \nfor sacrifice, to glory.  \n27 When thrice the men lead round the Steed, in order, who  \ngoeth to the Gods as meet oblation,  \nThe goat precedeth him, the share of Pushan, and to the  \nGods the sacrifice announceth.  \n28 Invoker, ministering priest, stoner, fire-kindler, Soma-presser,  \nsage, reciter,  \nWith this well ordered sacrifice, well finished, do ye fill full  \nthe channels of the rivers.  \n29 The hewers of the post and those who carry it, and those  \nwho carve the knob to deck the Horse's stake;  \nThose who prepare the cooking-vessels for the Steed,\xc2\x97may  \nthe approving help of these promote our work.  \n30 Forth, for the regions of the Gods, the Charger with his  \nsmooth back is come; my prayer attends him.  \nIn him rejoice the singer and the sages. A good friend  \nhave we won for the Gods\xc2\x92 banquet.\n\np. 229\n\n31 May the fleet Courser's halter and his heel-ropes, the headstall  \nand the girths and cords about him,  \nAnd the grass put within his mouth to bait him,\xc2\x97among  \nthe Gods, too, let all these be with thee.  \n32 What part of the Steed's flesh the fly hath eaten, or is left  \nsticking to the post or hatchet,  \nOr to the slayer's hands and nails adhereth,\xc2\x97among the  \nGods, tog, may all this he with thee.  \n33 Food undigested steaming from his belly, and any odour of  \nraw flesh remaining,  \nThis let the immolators set in order and dress the sacrifice  \nwith perfect cooking.  \n34 What from thy body which with fire is roasted, when thou  \nart set upon the spit, distilleth,\xc2\x97  \nLet not that lie on earth or grass neglected, but to the longing  \nGods let all be offered.  \n35 They who, observing that the Horse is ready, call out and  \nsay, The smell is good; remove it;  \nAnd, craving meat, await the distribution,\xc2\x97may their  \napproving help promote our labour.  \n36 The trial-fork of the flesh cooking caldron, the vessels out  \nof which the broth is sprinkled,  \nThe warming-pots, the covers of the dishes, hooks,  \ncarving-boards,\xc2\x97all these attend the Charger.  \n37 Let not the fire, smoke-scented, make thee crackle, nor  \nglowing caldron smell and break to pieces.  \nOffered, beloved, approved, and consecrated,\xc2\x97such Charger  \ndo the Gods accept with favour.  \n38 The starting-place, his place of rest and rolling, the ropes  \nwherewith the Charger's feet were fastened,  \nThe water that he drank, the food he tasted,\xc2\x97among the  \nGods, too, may all these attend thee.  \n39 The robe they spread upon the Horse to clothe him, the  \nupper covering and the golden trappings,  \nThe halters which restrain the Steed, the heel-ropes,\xc2\x97all  \nthese, as grateful to the Gods, they offer.  \n40 If one, when seated, with excessive urging hath with his  \nheel or with his whip distressed thee,  \nAll these thy woes, as with oblation's ladle at sacrifices,  \nwith my prayer I banish.  \n41 The four-and-thirty ribs of the swift Courser, kin to the  \nGods, the slayer's hatchet pierces.\n\np. 230\n\nCut ye with skill so that the parts be flawless, and piece by  \npiece declaring them dissect them.  \n42 Of Tvashtar's Courser there is one dissector: this is the  \ncustom: two there are who guide him.  \nSuch of his limbs as I divide in order, all these, amid the  \nlumps, in fire I offer.  \n43 Let not thy dear soul burn thee as thou comest, let not the  \nhatchet linger in thy body.  \nLet not a greedy clumsy immolator, missing the joints,  \nmangle thy limbs unduly.  \n44 No, here thou diest not, thou art not injured: only by easy  \npaths to Gods thou goest.  \nBoth Bays, both Spotted Mares are now thy fellows, and to  \nthe Ass's pole is yoked the Courser.  \n45 May this Steed bring us all-sustaining riches, wealth in  \ngood kine, good horses, manly offspring.  \nFreedom from sin may Aditi vouchsafe us; the Steed with  \nour oblations gain us lordship!  \n46 We will, with Indra and all Gods to help us, bring these  \nexisting worlds into subjection.  \nWith the \xc3\x82dityas, with the band of Maruts, may Indra  \ngive us medicine to heal us.  \nOur sacrifice, our bodies, and our offspring may Indra  \nregulate with the \xc3\x82dityas.  \n47 O Agni, be our nearest Friend, etc., as in III. 25.  \nTo thee then, O Most Bright, etc., as in III. 26.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XXVI](wyvbk26.htm)\n\n"
