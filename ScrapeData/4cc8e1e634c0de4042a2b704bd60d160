Is there one single rule of prosody that has been spared? Is there\none single short syllable that must always remain short, or a long syllable\nthat must always remain long? If all restrictions of prosody are thus removed,\nour metres, no doubt, become perfectly regular. But it should be remembered\nthat these metrical rules, for which all this carnage has been committed, are\nnot founded upon any a priori principles, but deduced by ancient or modern\nmetricians from those very hymns which seem so constantly to violate\n\np. cxi\n\nthem. Neither ancient nor modern metricians had, as far as we know, any\nevidence to go upon besides the hymns of the Rig-veda; and the philosophical\nspeculations as to the origin of metres in which some of them indulge, and\nfrom which they would fain derive some of their unbending rules, are, as need\nhardly be said, of no consequence whatever. I cannot understand what definite\nidea even modern writers connect with such statements as that, for instance,\nthe Trish _t_ ubh metre sprang from the _G_ agati metre, that the eleven\nsyllables of the former are an abbreviation of the twelve syllables of the\nlatter. Surely, metres are not made artificially, and by addition or\nsubtraction. Metres have a natural origin in the rhythmic sentiment of\ndifferent people, and they become artificial and arithmetical in the same way\nas language with its innate principles of law and analogy becomes in course of\ntime grammatical and artificial. To derive one metre from another is like\nderiving a genitive from a nominative, which we may do indeed for grammatical\npurposes, but which no one would venture to do who is at all acquainted with\nthe natural and independent production of grammatical forms. Were we to\narrange the Trish _t_ ubh and _G_ agati metres in chronological order, I\nshould decidedly place the Trish _t_ ubh first, for we see, as it were before\nour eyes, how sometimes one foot, sometimes two and three feet in a Trish _t_\nubh verse admit an additional syllable at the end, particularly in set phrases\nwhich would not submit to a Trish _t_ ubh ending. The phrase _s_ a _m_ no\nbhava dvipade _s_ a _m_ _k_ atushpade is evidently a solemn phrase, and we see\nit brought in without hesitation, even though every other line of the same\nstrophe or hymn is Trish _t_ ubh, i. e. hendecasyllabic, not dodecasyllabic.\nSee, for instance, VI, 74, 1; VII, 54, 1; X, 85, 44; 165, 1. However, I\nmaintain by no means that this was the actual origin of _G_ agati metres; I\nonly refer to it in order to show the groundlessness of metrical theories\nwhich represent the component elements, a foot of one or two or four syllables\nas given first, and as afterwards compounded into systems of two, three or\nfour such feet, and who therefore would wish us to look upon the\nhendecasyllabic Trish _t_ ubh as originally a dodecasyllabic _G_ agati, only\n\np. cxii\n\ndeprived of its tail. If my explanation of the name of Trish _t_ ubh, i. e.\nThree-step, is right, its origin must be ascribed to a far more natural\nprocess than that of artificial amputation. It was to accompany a choros, i.\ne. a dance, which after advancing freely for eight steps in one direction,\nturned back (v _ri_ tta) with three steps, the second of which was strongly\nmarked, and would therefore, whether in song or recitation, be naturally\naccompanied by a long syllable. It certainly is so in the vast majority of\nTrish _t_ ubhs which have been handed down to us. But if among these verses we\nfind a small number in which this simple and palpable rhythm is violated, and\nwhich nevertheless were preserved from the first in that imperfect form,\nalthough the temptation to set them right must have been as great to the\nancient as it has proved to be to the modern students of the Veda, are we to\nsay that nearly all, if not all, the rules that determine the length and\nshortness of syllables, and which alone give character to every verse, are to\nbe suspended? Or, ought we not rather to consider, whether the ancient\nchoregic poets may not have indulged occasionally in an irregular movement? We\nsee that this was so with regard to Gayatri verses. We see the greater freedom\nof the first and second padas occasionally extend to the third; and it will be\nimpossible, without intolerable violence, to remove all the varieties of the\nlast pada of a Gayatri of which I have given examples above, pages\n[civ](sbe3213.htm#page_civ) seqq.\n\nIt is, of course, impossible to give here all the evidence that might be\nbrought forward in support of similar freedom Traish _t_ ubha V _ri_ tta.in\nTrish _t_ ubh verses, and I admit that the number of real varieties with them\nis smaller than with the Gayatris. In order to make the evidence which I have\nto bring forward in support of these varieties as unassailable as possible, I\nhave excluded nearly every pada that occurs only in the first, second, or\nthird line of a strophe, and have restricted myself, with few exceptions, and\nthose chiefly referring to padas that had been quoted by other scholars in\nsupport of their own theories, to the final padas of Trish _t_ ubh verses. Yet\neven with this limited evidence, I think I shall be able to establish at least\nthree\n\np. cxiii\n\nvarieties of Trish _t_ ubh. Preserving the same classification which I adopted\nbefore for the Gayatris, so as to include the important eighth syllable of the\nTrish _t_ ubh, which does not properly belong to the v _ri_ tta, I maintain\nthat class 4.  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84, class 5.  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84, and class 8.  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84 must\nbe recognised as [legitimate](errata.htm#1) endings in the hymns of the Veda,\nand that by recognising them we are relieved from nearly all, if not all, the\nmore violent prosodial licences which Professor Kuhn felt himself obliged to\nadmit in his theory of Vedic metres.\n\n\xc2\xa74\\.  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84.\n\nThe verses which fall under \xc2\xa7 4 are so numerous that after those of the first\nMa _n_ _d_ ala, mentioned above, they need not be given here in full. They are\nsimply cases where the eighth syllable is not lengthened, and they cannot be\nsupposed to run counter to any rule of the Prati _s_ akhya, for the simple\nreason that the Prati _s_ akhya never gave such a rule as that the eighth\nsyllable must be lengthened, if the ninth is short. Examples will be found in\nthe final pada of Trish _t_ ubhs: II, 30, 6; III, 36, 4; 53, 15; 54, 12; IV,\n1, 16; 2, 7; 9; 11; 4, 12; 6, 1; 2; 4; 7, 7; 11, 5; 17, 3; 23, 6; 24, 2; 27,\n1; 28, 5; 55, 5; 57, 2; V, 1, 2; VI, 17, 10; 21, 8; 23, 7; 25, 5; 29, 6; 33,\n1; 62, 1; 63, 7; VII, 21, 5; 28, 3; 42, 4; 56, 15; 60, 10; 84, 2; 92, 4; VIII,\n1, 33; 96, 9; IX, 92, 5; X, 61, 12; 13; 74, 3; 117, 7.\n\nIn support of \xc2\xa7 5\\.  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84, the number of cases is smaller, but it should\nbe remembered that it might be considerably increased if I had not restricted\nmyself to the final pada of each Trish _t_ ubh, while the first, second, and\nthird padas would have yielded a much larger harvest:\n\n\xc2\xa75\\.  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84.\n\nI, 89, 9. ma no madhya ririshata\xcc\x84yu\xcc\x84r ga\xcc\x84nto\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nI, 92, 6. supratika saumanasa\xcc\x84ya\xcc\x84 _g_ i\xcc\x84ga\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nI, 114, 5; 117, 2; 122, 1; 122, 8; 186, 3; II, 4, 2; III, 49, 2; IV, 3, 9; 26,\n6; V, 41, 14; VI, 25, 2; 66, 11; VII, 8, 6; 28, 4; 68, 1; 71, 2; 78, 1; 93,\n7b; IX, 90, 4; X, 11, 8.\n\np. cxiv\n\nI do not wish to deny that in several of these lines it would be possible to\nremove the long syllable from the ninth place by conjectural emendation.\nInstead of a\xc2\xb4yur in I, 89, 9, we might read a\xc2\xb4yu; in I, 92, 6, we might drop\nthe augment of a _g_ i _g_ ar; in II, 4, 2, we might admit synizesis in\na\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x86*tir, and then read _g_ i\xcc\x84ra\xcc\x86-a\xcc\x84 _s_ va\xcc\x84 _h_ , as in I, 141, 12. In VI,\n25, 2, after eliding the a of ava, we might read d\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84si\xcc\x84 _h_. But even if, in\naddition to all this, we were to admit the possible suppression of final m in\nasmabhyam, mahyam, and in the accusative singular, or the suppression of s in\nthe nominative singular, both of which would be extreme measures, we should\nstill have a number of cases which could not be righted without even more\nviolent remedies. Why then should we not rather admit the occasional\nappearance of a metrical variation which certainly has a powerful precedent in\nthe dispondeus of Gayatris? I am not now acquainted with the last results of\nmetrical criticism in Virgil, but, unless some new theories now prevail, I\nwell recollect that spondaic hexameters, though small in number, much smaller\nthan in the Veda, were recognised by the best scholars, and no emendations\nattempted to remove them. If then in Virgil we read,\n\n'Cum patribus populoque, penatibusque et magnis dis,'\n\nwhy not follow the authority of the best MSS. and the tradition of the Prati\n_s_ akhyas and admit a dispondeus at the end of a Trish _t_ ubh rather than\nsuspend, in order to meet this single difficulty, some of the most fundamental\nrules of prosody?\n\nI now proceed to give a more numerous list of Traish _t_ ubha padas ending in\na choriambus,  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84, again confining myself, with few exceptions, to\nfinal padas:\n\n\xc2\xa7 8\\.  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\n\nI, 62, 3. sam usriyabhir vava _s_ a\xcc\x84nta\xcc\x86 na\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nI, 103, 4. yad dha sunu _h_ _s_ ravase na\xcc\x84ma\xcc\x86 da\xcc\x86dhe\xcc\x84.\n\nI, 121, 9; 122, 10b; 173, 8; 186, 2; II, 4, 3; 19, 1; 33, 14; IV, 1, 19c a;\n25, 4; 39, 2; V, 30, 12; 41, 4; 41, 15;\n\np. cxv\n\n[paragraph continues] VI, 4, 7; 10, 5; 11, 4; 13, 1b; 13, 1d; 20, 1b; 20, 1d;\n29, 4; 33, 3; 33, 5; 44, 11; 49, 12; 68, 5; 68, 7; VII, 19, 10; 62, 4; IX, 97,\n26; X, 55; 8; 99, 9; 108, 6; 169, 1.\n\nIt is perfectly true that this sudden change in the rhythm of Trish _t_ ubh\nverses, making their ending iambic instead of trochaic, grates on our ears.\nBut, I believe, that if we admit a short stop after the seventh syllable, the\nintended rhythm of these verses will become intelligible. We remarked a\nsimilar break in the verses of hymn X, 77, where the sudden transition to an\niambic metre was used with great effect, and the choriambic ending, though\nless effective, is by no means offensive. It should be remarked also, that in\nmany, though not in all cases, a caesura takes place after the seventh\nsyllable, and this is, no doubt, a great help towards a better delivery of\nthese choriambic Trish _t_ ubhs.\n\nWhile, however, I contend for the recognition of these three varieties of the\nnormal Trish _t_ ubh metre, I am quite willing to admit that other variations\nbesides these, which occur from time to time in the Veda, form a legitimate\nsubject of critical discussion.\n\n\xc2\xa7 2\\.  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84.\n\nTrish _t_ ubh verses, the final pada of which ends in  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84, I should\ngenerally prefer to treat as ending in a _G_ agata pada, in which this ending\nis more legitimate.

Cf. IV, 51, 2; VI, 5, 2; 10, 4; 51, 3; VII, 3, 1; 9;\n9, 1b; 56, 12; X, 46, 7b.\n\nI must reserve what I have to say about other metres of the Veda for another\nopportunity, but I cannot leave Omission of final m and s.this subject without\nreferring once more to a metrical licence which has been strongly advocated by\nProfessor Kuhn and others, and by the admission of which there is no doubt\nthat many difficulties might be removed, I mean the occasional omission of a\nfinal m and s, and the subsequent contraction of the final and initial vowels.\nThe arguments that have been brought forward in support of this are very\npowerful. There is the general argument that final s and m are liable to be\ndropt in other Aryan languages, and particularly for metrical purposes. There\nis the stronger argument that in some cases final s and m in Sanskrit may or\nmay not be omitted, even apart from any metrical stress. In Sanskrit we find\nthat the demonstrative pronoun sas appears most frequently as sa (sa dadati),\nand if followed by liquid vowels, it may coalesce with them even in later\nSanskrit. Thus we see saisha for sa esha, sendra _h_ for sa indra _h_\nsanctioned for metrical purposes even by Pa _n_ ini, VI, 1, 134. We might\nrefer also to feminines which have s in the nominative singular after bases in\nu, but drop it after bases in i. We find in the Sa _m_ hita text, V, 7, 8,\nsvadhitiva, instead of svadhiti _h_ -iva in the Pada text, sanctioned by the\nPrati _s_ akhya 259; likewise IX, 61, 10, Sa _m_ hita, bhu\xc2\xb4my a\xc2\xb4 dade, instead\nof Pada, bhu\xc2\xb4mi _h_ a\xc2\xb4 dade. But before we draw any general conclusions from\nsuch instances, we should consider whether they do not admit of a grammatical\ninstead of a metrical explanation. The nominative singular of the\ndemonstrative pronoun was sa before it was sas; by the side of bhu\xc2\xb4mi _h_ we\nhave a secondary form bhu\xc2\xb4mi; and we may conclude from svadhiti-van, I, 88, 2,\nthat the Vedic poets knew of a form svadhiti, by the side of svadhiti _h_.\n\nAs to the suppression of final m, however, we see it admitted by the best\nauthorities, or we see at least alternate forms with or without m, in tubhya,\nwhich occurs\n\np. cxviii\n\nfrequently instead of tubhyam a, and twice, at least, without apparently any\nmetrical reason b. We find asma\xc2\xb4ka instead of asma\xc2\xb4kam (I, 173, 10), yushma\xc2\xb4ka\ninstead of yushma\xc2\xb4kam (VII, 59, 9-10), ya _g_ adhva instead of ya _g_ adhvam\n(VIII, 2, 37) sanctioned both by the Sa _m_ hita and Pada texts c.\n\nIf then we have such precedents, it may well be asked why we should hesitate\nto adopt the same expedient, the omission of final m and s, whenever the Vedic\nmetres seem to require it. Professor Bollensen's remark, that Vedic verses\ncannot be treated to all the licences of Latin scanning d, is hardly a\nsufficient answer; and he himself, though under a slightly different form,\nwould admit as much, if not more, than has been admitted on this point by\nProfessors Kuhn and Roth. On a priori grounds I should by no means feel\nopposed to the admission of a possible elision of final s or m, or even n; and\nmy only doubt is whether it is really necessary for the proper scanning of\nVedic metres.\n\nMy own opinion has always been, that if we admit on a larger scale what in\nsingle words can hardly be doubted Synizesis.by anybody, viz. the\npronunciation of two syllables as one, we need not fall back on the elision of\nfinal consonants in order to arrive at a proper scanning of Vedic metres. On\nthis point I shall have to say a few words in conclusion, because I shall\nfrequently avail myself of this licence, for the purpose of righting\napparently corrupt verses in the hymns of the Rig-veda; and I feel bound to\nexplain, once for all, why I avail myself of it in preference to other\nemendations which have been proposed by scholars such as Professors Benfey,\nKuhn, Roth, Bollensen, and others.\n\nThe merit of having first pointed out-some cases where\n\np. cxix\n\ntwo syllables must be treated as one, belongs, I believe, to Professor\nBollensen in his article, 'Zur Herstellung des Veda,' published in Benfey's\nOrient and Occident, vol. ii, p. 461. He proposed, for instance, to write\nhyana\xc2\xb4 instead of hiyana\xc2\xb4, IX, 13, 6; dhyano instead of dhiyano, VIII, 49, 5;\nsahyase instead of sahiyase, I. 71, 4; yano instead of iyano, VIII, 50, 5, &c.\nThe actual alteration of these words seems to me unnecessary; nor should we\nthink of resorting to such violent measures in Greek where, as far as metrical\npurposes are concerned, two vowels have not unfrequently to be treated as one.\n\nThat iva counts in many passages as one syllable is admitted by everybody. The\nonly point on which I differ is that I do not see why iva, when monosyllabic,\nshould be changed to va, instead of being pronounced quickly, or, to adopt the\nterminology of Greek grammarians, by synizesis a. Synizesis is well explained\nby Greek scholars as a quick pronunciation of two vowels so that neither\nshould be lost, and as different thereby from synaloephe, which means the\ncontraction of two vowels into one b. This synizesis is by no means restricted\nto iva and a few other words, but seems to me a very frequent expedient\nresorted to by the ancient _Ri_ shis.\n\nOriginally it may have arisen from the fact that language allows in many cases\nalternate forms of one or two syllables. As in Greek we have double forms like\n\xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xce\xb3\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82 and \xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xbb\xce\xb3\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, \xce\xb3\xce\xb1\xce\xbb\xce\xb1\xce\xba\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xcf\x86\xce\xac\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 and \xce\xb3\xce\xbb\xce\xb1\xce\xba\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xcf\x86\xce\xac\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, \xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xcf\x84\xce\xb7\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82 and \xcf\x80\xcf\x84\xce\xb7\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82,\n\xcf\x80\xcf\x85\xce\xba\xce\xb9\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82 and \xcf\x80\xcf\x85\xce\xba\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82 c, and as in Latin we have the shortening\n\np. cxx\n\nor suppression of vowels carried out on the largest scale a. we find in\nSanskrit, too, such double forms as p _ri_ thvi or p _ri_ thivi, adhi and dhi,\napi and pi, ava and va. The occurrence of such forms which have nothing to do\nwith metrical considerations, but are perfectly legitimate from a grammatical\npoint of view, would encourage a tendency to treat two syllables--and\nparticularly two short syllables--as one, whenever an occasion arose. There\nare, besides, in the Vedic Sanskrit a number of forms where, as we saw, a long\nsyllable has to be pronounced as two. In some of these cases this\npronunciation is legitimate, i. e. it preserves an original dissyllabic form\nwhich in course of time had become monosyllabic. In other cases the same\nprocess takes place through a mistaken sense of analogy, where we cannot prove\nthat an original dissyllabic form had any existence even in a prehistoric\nstate of language. The occurrence of a number of such alternate forms would\nnaturally leave a general impression in the minds of poets that two short\nsyllables and one long syllable were under certain circumstances\ninterchangeable. So considerable a number of words in which a long syllable\nhas to be pronounced as two syllables has been collected by Professors Kuhn,\nBollensen, and others, that no doubt can remain on this subject. Vedic poets,\nbeing allowed to change a semivowel into a vowel, were free to say na\xcc\x84sa\xcc\x84tya\xcc\x84\nand na\xcc\x84sa\xcc\x84\xcc\x86 _t_ y\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84, VIII, 5, 32; p _ri \xcc\x86_thi\xcc\x84vya\xcc\x84s and p _ri \xcc\x86_thi\xcc\x84\xcc\x86vy\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84\n_h_ ; pi\xcc\x84tro\xcc\x84 _h_ and pi\xcc\x84\xcc\x86tr\xcc\x86o\xcc\x84 _h_ , I, 31, 4. They could separate compound\nwords, and pronounce gh _ri \xcc\x85_ta\xcc\x84nna\xcc\x84 _h_ or gh _ri \xcc\x86_ta\xcc\x86-a\xcc\x84nna\xcc\x84 _h_ , VII, 3,\n1. They could insert a kind of shewa or svarabhakti in words like sa\xcc\x84mne\xcc\x84, or\nsa\xcc\x84mn\xcc\x86e\xcc\x84, VIII, 6, 47; dha\xcc\x84mne\xcc\x84 or dha\xcc\x84mn\xcc\x86e\xcc\x84, VIII, 92, 25; a\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x84v _n_ a\xcc\x84 _h_\nand a\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x84vn\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84 _h_ , IX, 63, 5.

Need we wonder then\nif we find that, on the other hand, they allowed themselves to pronounce p\n_ri_ \xcc\x86thi\xcc\x86vi\xcc\x84 as p _ri_ \xcd\xa1\xcc\x86thi\xcc\x86*vi\xcc\x84, I, 191, 6; VII, 34, 7; 99, 3; dh _ri \xcc\x85_sh\n_n_ a\xcc\x86va\xcc\x86 as dh _ri \xcc\x85_sh _n_ \xcd\xa1\xcc\x86ava\xcc\x86*, V, 52, 14; su\xcc\x86va\xcc\x84na\xcc\x84 as su\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86va\xcc\x84*na\xcc\x84?\nThere is no reason why we should change the spelling of su\xcc\x86va\xcc\x84na\xcc\x86 into\nsva\xcc\x84na\xcc\x84. The metre itself tells us at once where suvana is to be pronounced as\ntwo or as three syllables. Nor is it possible to believe that those who first\nhanded down and afterwards wrote down the text of the Vedic hymns, should have\nbeen ignorant of that freedom of pronunciation. Why, there is not one single\npassage in the whole of the ninth Ma _n_ _d_ ala, where, as far as I know,\nsuvana should not be pronounced as dissyllabic, i. e. as su\xcc\x86\xcd\xa1va\xcc\x84*na\xcc\x84; and to\nsuppose that the scholars of India did not know how that superfluous syllable\nshould be removed, is really taking too low an estimate of men like Vya _li_\nor _S_ aunaka.\n\nBut if we once admit that in these cases two syllables separated by a single\nconsonant were pronounced as one and were metrically counted as one, we can\nhardly resist the evidence in favour of a similar pronunciation in a large\nnumber of other words, and we shall find that by the admission of this rapid\npronunciation, or of what in Plautus we should call irrational vowels, many\nverses assume at once their regular form without the necessity of admitting\nthe suppression of final s, m, n, or the introduction of other prosodial\nlicences. To my mind the most convincing passages are those where, as in the\nAtyash _t_ i and similar hymns, a poet repeats the same phrase twice, altering\nonly one or two words, but without endeavouring to avoid an excess of\nsyllables which, to our mind, unless we resort to synizesis, would completely\ndestroy the uniformity of the metre. Thus we read:\n\nI, 133, 6. a\xcc\x86pu\xcc\x84ru\xcc\x86sha\xcc\x84ghno\xcd\xa1\xcc\x84\xe0\xa4\xbdpra\xcc\x86*ti\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x86 _s_ u\xcc\x84ra\xcc\x86 sa\xcc\x84tva\xcc\x86bhi\xcc\x84 _h_ ,  \n                             tri\xcc\x86sa\xcc\x84ptai\xcc\x84 _h_ _s_ u\xcc\x84ra\xcc\x86 sa\xcc\x84tva\xcc\x86bhi\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\np. cxxii\n\nHere no\xe0\xa4\xbdpra must be pronounced with one ictus only, in order to get a complete\nagreement between the two iambic diameters.\n\nI, 134, 5.\n\nu\xcc\x84gra\xcc\x84 i\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86sha\xcc\x86* _n_ a\xcc\x84nta\xcc\x86 bhu\xcc\x84rva\xcc\x86 _n_ i\xcc\x84,  \na\xcc\x86pa\xcc\x84m i\xcc\x86sha\xcc\x84nta\xcc\x86 bhu\xcc\x84rva\xcc\x86 _n_ i\xcc\x84.\n\nAs ishanta never occurs again, I suspect that the original reading was isha\n_n_ anta in both lines, and that in the second line isha _n_ anta, pronounced\nrapidly, was mistaken for ishanta. Is not bhurva _n_ i a locative,\ncorresponding to the datives in vane which are so frequently used in the sense\nof infinitives? See note to I, 6, 8, page 47 seq. In I, 138, 3, we must read:\n\na\xcc\x86he\xcc\x84 _l_ a\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84na\xcc\x86 u\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86ru\xcc\x86* _s_ a\xcc\x84 _m_ sa\xcc\x86 sa\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x84 bha\xcc\x86va\xcc\x84,  \n             va\xcc\x84 _g_ e\xcc\x84-va\xcc\x84 _g_ e\xcc\x84 sa\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x84 bha\xcc\x86va\xcc\x84.\n\nIn I, 129, I I,\n\na\xcc\x86dha\xcc\x84 hi\xcc\x86 tva\xcc\x84 _g_ a\xcc\x86ni\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _g_ i\xcc\x84 _g_ a\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84d va\xcc\x86so\xcc\x84,  \n               ra\xcc\x84ksho\xcc\x84ha\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86 _n_ a\xcc\x84* _m_ tva\xcc\x84 _g_ i\xcc\x84 _g_ a\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84*d va\xcc\x86so\xcc\x84,\n\nwe might try to remove the difficulty by omitting vaso at the end of the\nrefrain, but this would be against the general character of these hymns. We\nwant the last word vaso, if possible, at the end of both lines. But, if so, we\nmust admit two cases of synizesis, or, if this seems too clumsy, we must omit\ntva.\n\nI shall now proceed to give a number of other examples in which the same\nconsonantal synizesis seems necessary in order to make the rhythm of the\nverses perceptible to our ears as it was to the ears of the ancient _Ri_ shis.\n\nThe preposition anu takes synizesis in\n\nI, 127, 1. gh _ri \xcc\x86_ta\xcc\x84sya\xcc\x86 vi\xcc\x84bhra\xcc\x84sh _t_ i\xcc\x86m a\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86nu\xcc\x86* va\xcc\x84sh _t_ i\xcc\x86 _s_ o\xcc\x84 _k_\ni\xcc\x86sha\xcc\x84. Cf.

But in altering the text of the\nVeda many things have to be considered, and in our case it might be objected\nthat sahasva _h_ never occurs again as an epithet of Soma.\n\np. cxxiii\n\n[paragraph continues] As an invocation sahasva _h_ refers to no deity but\nAgni, and even in its other cases it is applied to Agni and Indra only.\nHowever, I do not by any means maintain that sahasva _h_ could not be applied\nto Soma, for nearly the same arguments could be used against sahasavan, if\nconjecturally put in the place of sahasva _h_ ; I only wish to point out how\neverything ought to be tried first, before we resort in the Veda to\nconjectural emendations. Therefore, if in our passage there should be any\nobjection to admitting the synizesis in abhi, I should much rather propose\nsynizesis of sahasavan, than change it into sahasva _h_. There is synizesis in\nmaha, e _g_. I, 133, 6. a\xcc\x86va\xcc\x84r ma\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86ha\xcc\x86* i\xcc\x84ndra\xcc\x86 da\xcc\x84d _ri \xcc\x86_hi\xcc\x86 _s_ ru\xcc\x86dhi\xcc\x84 na\xcc\x84\n_h_. Although this verse is quoted by the Prati _s_ akhya, Sara 522, as one in\nwhich the lengthened syllable dhi of _s_ rudhi does not occupy the tenth\nplace, and which therefore required special mention, the original poet\nevidently thought otherwise, and lengthened the syllable, being a syllable\nliable to be lengthened, because it really occupied the tenth place, and\ntherefore received a peculiar stress.\n\nThe preposition pari:\n\nVI, 52, 14.\n\nma\xcc\x84 vo\xcc\x84 va\xcc\x86 _k_ a\xcc\x84 _m_ si\xcc\x86 pa\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x86* _k_ a\xcc\x84kshya\xcc\x84ni\xcc\x86 vo\xcc\x84 _k_ a\xcc\x84m,  \nsu\xcc\x84mne\xcc\x84shv\xcc\x86 i\xcc\x84d vo\xcc\x84\xcc\x86 a\xcc\x84nta\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84 ma\xcc\x86de\xcc\x84ma\xcc\x84.\n\n[paragraph continues] Here Professor Kuhn (Beitrage, vol. iv, p. 197) begins\nthe last pada with vo _k_ am, but this is impossible, unless we change the\naccent of vo _k_ am, though even then the separation of the verb from ma and\nthe accumulation of two verbs in the last line would be objectionable.\n\nHa\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x86 is pronounced as ha\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x86*:\n\nVII, 32, 12. ya\xcc\x86 i\xcc\x84ndro\xcc\x84 ha\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x86*va\xcc\x84n na\xcc\x86 da\xcc\x86bha\xcc\x84nti\xcc\x86 ta\xcc\x84 _m_ ri\xcc\x86pa\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nII, 18, 5. a\xcc\x84 _k_ a\xcc\x84tva\xcc\x84ri\xcc\x84 _m_ _s_ a\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 ha\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x86*bhi\xcc\x84r yu\xcc\x86 _g_ a\xcc\x84na\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nHence I propose to scan the difficult verse I, 167, 1, as follows:\n\nsa\xcc\x86ha\xcc\x84s\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x86 _m_ ta\xcc\x86 i\xcc\x84ndra\xcc\x86-u\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x86yo\xcc\x84 na\xcc\x84 _h_ ,  \nsa\xcc\x86ha\xcc\x84sra\xcc\x86m i\xcc\x86sho\xcc\x84 ha\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x86*vo\xcc\x84 gu\xcc\x84rta\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84 _h_  a,\n\np. cxxiv\n\nsa\xcc\x86ha\xcc\x84s\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x84m r\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84yo\xcc\x84 ma\xcc\x84da\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84dhya\xcc\x84i,  \nsa\xcc\x86ha\xcc\x84sri\xcc\x86 _n_ a\xcc\x86 u\xcc\x86pa\xcc\x86 no\xcc\x84 ya\xcc\x84ntu\xcc\x86 va\xcc\x84 _g_ a\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\nThat the final o instead of as is treated as a short syllable we saw before,\nand in I, 133, 6, we observed that it was liable to synizesis.

Professor\nBollensen's proposal to change iyam to im, and ayam to am (Orient and\nOccident, vol. ii, p. 461), would only cause obscurity, without any adequate\ngain, while other words would by a similar suppression of vowels or consonants\nbecome simply irrecognisable. In I, 169, 6, for instance, adha has to be\n\np. cxxv\n\npronounced with one ictus; in VI, 26, 7, sa\xcd\xa1\xcc\x86dha\xcc\x86*vi\xcc\x84ra\xcc\x86 is tri-syllabic.

I know I shall seem to some to have been too timid in retaining\nwhatever can possibly be retained in the traditional text of these ancient\nhymns, while others will look upon the emendations which I have suggested as\nunpardonable temerity. Let everything be weighed in the just scales of\nargument. Those who argue for victory, and not for truth, can have no hearing\nin our court. There is too much serious work to be done to allow time for\nwrangling or abuse. Any dictionary will supply strong words to those who\ncondescend to such warfare, but strong arguments require honest labour, sound\njudgment, and, above all, a genuine love of truth.\n\nThe second volume, which I am now preparing for Press, will contain the\nremaining hymns addressed to the Maruts. The notes will necessarily have to be\nreduced to smaller dimensions, but they must always constitute the more\nimportant part in a translation or, more truly, in a deciphering of Vedic\nhymns.\n\nF.
