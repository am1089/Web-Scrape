As in the case of the offerings, (Vayu and Pra _n_ a. must be held\napart). This has been explained (in the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutra).\n\nThe section of the Va _g_ asaneyaka which begins, 'Voice held, I shall speak'\n(B _ri_. Up. I. 5, 21). determines Pra _n_ a to be the best among the organs\nof the body, viz. speech and so on, and Vayu to be the best among the Devas,\nviz. Agni and so on.--Similarly in the _Kh_ andogya, Vayu is affirmed to be\nthe general absorber of the Devas, 'Vayu indeed is the absorber' (IV, 3, 1),\nwhile Pra _n_ a is said to be the general absorber of the organs of the body,\n'Breath indeed is the absorber' (IV, 3, 3).--The doubt here arises whether\nVayu and Pra _n_ a are to be conceived as separate or not.\n\nAs non-separate, the purvapakshin maintains; because in\n\np. 257\n\ntheir true nature they do not differ. And as their true nature does not differ\nthey must not be meditated upon separately. Another scriptural passage also\ndeclares that the organs of the body and the divinities are non-different in\ntheir true nature, 'Agni having become speech entered the mouth,' &c. (Ait.\n\xc3\x82r. II, 4, 2, 4). Moreover, the passage B _ri_. Up. I, 5, 13, 'These are all\nalike, all endless,' declares that the powers of the Devas constitute the Self\nof the organs of the body. And various other passages also testify to the\nfundamental non-difference of the two. In some places we have even a direct\nidentification of the two, 'What Pra _n_ a is, that is Vayu.' And in the _s_\nloka concluding the Va _g_ asaneyaka-chapter to which the passage under\ndiscussion belongs, the text refers to pra _n_ a only ('He verily rises from\nthe breath and sets in the breath'), and thus shows the breath to be one with\nthe previously mentioned Vayu. This conclusion is moreover confirmed by the\nfact that the observance enjoined in the end refers to pra _n_ a only,\n'Therefore let a man perform one observance only, let him breathe up and let\nhim breathe down' (B _ri_. Up. I, 5, 23). Similarly, the _Kh_ andogya-passage,\nIV, 3, 6, 'One god swallowed the four great ones,' intimates that there is one\nabsorber only, and does not say that one god is the absorber of the one set of\nfour, and another the absorber of the other set of four.--From all this it\nfollows that Vayu and Pra _n_ a are to be conceived as one.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. Vayu and Pra _n_ a are to be conceived\nseparately, because the text teaches them in separation. The separate\ninstruction given by the text with reference to the organs and the Devas for\nthe purposes of meditation would be meaningless if the meditations were not\nheld apart.--But the purvapakshin maintains that owing to the essential non-\ndifference of Vayu and Pra _n_ a the meditations are not to be separated!--\nAlthough, we reply, there may be non-difference of true nature, yet there may\nbe difference of condition giving rise to difference of instruction, and,\nthrough the latter, to difference of meditation. And although the introduction\nof the concluding _s_ loka. may be accounted for on the ground of its\n\np. 258\n\nshowing the fundamental non-difference of the two, it yet has no power to\nsublate the previously declared difference of the objects of meditation.\nMoreover, the text institutes a comparison between Vayu and Pra _n_ a, which\nagain shows that the two are different, 'And as it was with the central breath\namong the breaths, so it was with Vayu, the wind among those deities' (B _ri_.\nUp. I, 5, 22).--This explains also the mention made of the observance (I, 5,\n23). The word 'only' (in 'Let a man perform one observance only') has the\npurpose of establishing the observance with regard to Pra _n_ a, by sublating\nthe observances with regard to speech and so on, regarding which the text had\nremarked previously that they were disturbed by Death ('Death having become\nweariness took them'), and does not by any means aim at sublating the\nobservance with regard to Vayu; for the section beginning 'Next follows the\nconsideration of the observances' distinctly asserts that the observances of\nVayu and Pra _n_ a were equally unbroken.--Moreover, the text, after having\nsaid, 'Let a man perform one observance only,' declares in the end that the\nfruit of that observance is the obtaining of (union with) Vayu ('Then he\nobtains through it union and oneness with that deity'), and thus shows that\nthe observance with regard to Vayu is not to be considered as sublated. That\nby that 'deity' we have to understand Vayu, we conclude from the circumstance\nthat what the worshipper wishes to obtain is non-limitation of his Self 1, and\nthat previously the term 'deity' had been applied to Vayu, 'Vayu is the deity\nthat never sets.'--Analogously in the _Kh_ andogya-passage the text represents\nVayu and Pra _n_ a as different, 'These are the two absorbers, Vayu among the\nDevas, Pra _n_ a among the pra _n_ as,' and in the concluding paragraph also\n(IV, 3,8) refers to them as distinct, 'These five and the other five make ten,\nand that is the K _ri_ ta.'--For these reasons Vayu and Pra _n_ a are to be\nconceived as different.\n\nThe Sutra compares the case under discussion to a\n\np. 239\n\nparallel one from the karmaka _n_ _d_ a, by means of the clause, 'as in the\ncase of the offerings.' With regard to the ish _t_ i comprising three\nsacrificial cakes, which is enjoined in the passage, Taitt. Sa _m_ h. II, 3,\n6, 'A puro _d_ a _s_ a on eleven potsherds to Indra the ruler, to Indra the\nover-ruler, to Indra the self-ruler,' it might be supposed that the three\ncakes are to be offered together because they are offered to one and the same\nIndra, and because the concluding sentence says, 'conveying to all (gods) he\ncuts off to preclude purposelessness.' But as the attributes (viz. 'ruler' and\nso on) differ, and as scripture enjoins that the ya _g_ ya and anuvakyamantras\nare to exchange places with regard to the different cakes 1, the divinity is\neach time a different one according to the address, and from this it follows\nthat the three offerings also are separate.--Thus, in the case under\ndiscussion, Vayu and Pra _n_ a, although fundamentally non-different, are to\nbe held apart as objects of meditation, and we have therefore to do with two\nseparate meditations.--This is explained in the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85karsha-ka _n_ _d_ a, 'The\ndivinities are separate on account of their being cognized thus.'\n\nBut while in the case of the three puro _d_ a _s_ as the difference of\nmaterial and divinity involves a difference on the part of the oblations, we\nhave in the case under discussion to do with one vidya only; for that the text\nenjoins one vidya only we conclude from the introductory and concluding\nstatements. There is contained, however, in this one vidya a double meditative\nactivity with regard to the bodily organs and the divinities, just as the\nagnihotra which is offered in the morning as well as in the evening requires a\ndouble activity. In this sense the Sutra says, 'as in the case of the\nofferings.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[258:1](sbe38186.htm#fr_163) Agnyadin apekshyanava _k_ _kh_ ino devo vayus te\ntu tenaivava _k_ _kh_ inna iti sa _m_ vargagu _n_ o vayur anava _k_ _kh_ inna\ndevata. \xc3\x82n.
