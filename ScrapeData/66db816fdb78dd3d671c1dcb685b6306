O friends, (bring) together your united food and praise to Agni, the\nstrongest (god) of (human) dwellings, the offspring of Vigour, the mighty\none--\n\n2\\. At whose onslaught [1](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:2:1), wherever it be, men\nrejoice in the seat of men, whom the worthy ones kindle, whom (human)\ncreatures produce.\n\n3\\. When we get together the food and the offerings of men, he has grasped,\nwith the strength of his splendour, the rein of _Ri_ ta.\n\n4\\. He indeed produces light even by night to him who is afar, when he, the\never-young purifier, destroys the lords of the forest.\n\n5\\. He at whose officiating (men) pour down the offering of their sweat on the\npaths--to Him who is noble by his own nature, the worlds have risen as to\nridges (of hills)--\n\n6\\. He whom the mortal has acquired, the much-desired (god), for the\nrefreshment of every one, the sweetener of nourishment, the homestead for the\n\xc3\x82yu--\n\n7\\. He indeed, the beast, mows off deserts and habitable land like a mower,\nthe golden-bearded with brilliant teeth, the _Ri_ bhu of undecaying strength.\n\n8\\. The bright one for whom (the gh _ri_ ta) streams (quickly) like an axe\n[1](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:8:1), as at (the sacrifice of) Atri. Him the well-\nbearing mother has born, as soon as [2](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:8:2) she had\nenjoyed love [3](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:8:3).\n\n9\\. He who satisfies thee for refreshment, O Agni\n\np. 383\n\nwho drinkest butter: mayst thou bestow splendour, renown, and (wise) mind on\nsuch mortals [1](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:9:1).\n\n10\\. Thus I have seized upon the spirit of Adhri _g_ (?) as upon a head of\ncattle given by thee [1](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:10:1). May then Atri, O Agni,\novercome the Dasyus who do not give (to the Brahmans); may Isha overcome the\nmen (who do not give).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Isha \xc3\x82treya (cf. verse 10); the metre is Anush _t_ ubh (verse\n10, Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti).--Verse 1 = VS. XV, 29; TS. II, 6, 11, 4; IV, 4, 4, 3; MS. IV, 11,\n1. Verses 2, 3 = TS. II, 1, 11, 3; MS. IV, 12, 4.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Yasya sam- _ri_ tau: see I, 127, 3.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. With the expression svadhiti _h_ -iva ri\xc2\xb4yate (Lanman, Noun-\nInflection, p. 375), compare V, 48, 4. ri _t_ im para _s_ o _h_ -iva. Of\ncourse we must ask: what is the thing that streams so brightly and quickly as\nan axe moves? The thing in question is stated to stream (riyate) for Agni now\nas it did at Atri's sacrifice. The expression 'as at Atri's sacrifice' seems\nto show that something like prayers or libations is alluded to. The verb\nriyate, on the other hand, seems to point either to rivers, or to streams of\nSoma or of Gh _ri_ ta. Thus, considering that Gh _ri_ ta is mentioned much\nmore frequently in connection with Agni than Soma, we are led to the\nconclusion that the poet speaks here of streams of Gh _ri_ ta. Should we not\nfor _s_ u _k_ i _h_ read _s_ u _k_ i, which would be here as in IV, 1, 6; VI,\n10, 2; IX, 67, 12, an epithet of Gh _ri_ ta? 'He for whom the bright (Gh _ri_\nta) streams quickly like an axe.' The origin of the reading\n\np. 384\n\nsu _k_ i _h_ may easily be accounted for; the word was thought to refer to\nAgni.--Another interpretation of this hemistich has been given by Benfey,\nVedica and Linguistica, p. 177.\n\nNote 2. Kra _n_ a\xc2\xb4: cf. I, 58, 3, note 1 ([p. 47](sbe46012.htm#page_47)).\n\nNote 3. 'Sobald sie den Liebesgenuss erlangt hatte.' Pischel, Ved. Studien, 1,\n71.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The first hemistich speaks of the worshipper in the singular, the\nsecond in the plural.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. This hemistich is quite obscure. With manyum a\xc2\xb4 dade, cf., for\ninstance, X, 48, 2. da _s_ yubhya _h_ pari n _ri_ m _n_ am a\xc2\xb4 dade. Adhri _g_\na _h_ may be the genitive of a proper name, as I have translated it; but this\nis quite doubtful. Was the hymn intended for a charm in which the sacrificer\nseized a head of cattle which represented the spirit of an enemy, and thus\ndeprived that enemy of his courage?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 8](sbe46112.htm)\n\n"
