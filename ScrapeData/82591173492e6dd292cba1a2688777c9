The Veda declares, The quality of the offspring depends on the quality of\nthe marriage rite.\' 1\n\n2\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): \'It is declared that a female\nwho has been purchased for money is not a wife. She cannot (assist) at\nsacrifices offered to the gods or the manes. Ka _s_ yapa has stated that she\nis a slave.\' 2\n\np. 208\n\n3\\. \'Those wicked men who, seduced by greed, give away a daughter for a fee,\nwho (thus) sell themselves and commit a great crime, fall (after death) into a\ndreadful place of punishment and destroy their family down to the seventh\n(generation). Moreover they will repeatedly die and be born again. All (this)\nis declared (to happen), if a fee (is taken).\'\n\n4\\. On the day of the full moon, on the eighth day (of each half month), on\nthe day of the new moon, on the appearance of a meteor, on the occasion of an\nearthquake, on visiting a burial-ground, and on the death of the king of the\ncountry, of a _S_ rotriya or of one who has the same Guru (satirthya), the\nstudy of the Veda must be discontinued for a day and a night. 4\n\n5\\. (The study of the Veda must be interrupted) while (a strong) wind (blows),\na foul smell (is perceptible), or hoar-frost (lies on the ground), when\ndancing (is going on), and while the sounds of singing, musical instruments,\nweeping, or of the Saman (melodies are audible). 5\n\n6\\. When thunder, lightning, and rain come together, (the interruption shall\nlast) three days except in the rainy season. 6\n\np. 209\n\n7\\. In the rainy season, too, (the reading must be interrupted) until the same\nhour of the (next) day or night, (if thunder and lightning come together), not\non account of rain. 7\n\n8\\. If (he has) received anything or dined on the occasion of a sacrifice in\nhonour of the manes, (he shall not read) during the remainder of the day, 8\n\n9\\. (Nor) after meals until (the food) has been digested. 9\n\n10\\. For the hand of a Brahma _n_ a is his mouth. 10\n\n11\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): According to the revealed\ntexts there is no difference whether one has eaten or received (a present at a\n_S_ raddha).\'\n\n12\\. (A student shall discontinue the study of the Veda) during three days in\ncase his father has died. 12\n\n13\\. \'Of two kinds, forsooth, is the virile energy of a famous Brahma _n_ a\nwho is learned in the Vedas, (that which resides) above the navel and the\nother (that resides) below the\' navel. Through that which 13\n\np. 210\n\n(resides) above the navel, his offspring is produced when he initiates Brahma\n_n_ as, when he teaches them, when he causes them to offer sacrifices, when he\nmakes them holy. All these are his children. But through that which resides\nbelow the navel the children of his body are produced. Therefore they never\nsay to a _S_ rotriya who is versed in the Vedas, \'Thou art destitute of\noffspring.\'\n\n14\\. \'Therefore a Brahma _n_ a has two names, two mouths, two kinds of virile\nenergy, and two births.\'\n\n15\\. (Let him discontinue the recitation of the Veda) as long as he is within\nhearing or sight of _S_ udras and Apapatras. 15\n\n16\\. When at night the howl of a solitary jackal is heard, he shall not study\nuntil he has slept. 16\n\n17\\. Let him not study in the evening and morning twilights nor on the Parva-\ndays. 17\n\n18\\. He shall not eat meat nor approach his wife (on those days). 18\n\n19\\. It is declared in the Veda, \'For on the Parva-days the Rakshasas and the\nPi _s_ a _k_ as roam about (in order to injure men).\'\n\n20\\. And on (the appearance of) other omens and portents (he shall not repeat\nthe Veda), except mentally, during a day and a night.\n\np. 211\n\n21\\. The mental recitation of the Veda must also be interrupted on births and\ndeaths (occurring in the family).\n\n22\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): \'The eighth day destroys the\nteacher, the fourteenth destroys the pupil, the fifteenth destroys learning;\ntherefore let him avoid (studying the Veda) on the Parva-days.\' 22\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[207:1](sbe1454.htm#fr_1030) **21**. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 12, 4.\n\n[207:2](sbe1454.htm#fr_1031) Vasish _th_ a I, 36-38. Govinda inserts after the\nwords \'Now they quote also,\' two Sutras in prose: 1. \'Ten virtuous sons and\ndaughters (spring) from a Daiva marriage, ten from a Pra _g_ apatya marriage.\nIt is declared in the Veda that the son of a wife wedded according to the\nBrahma rite (sanctifies) ten ancestors, ten descendants, and oneself.\' 2. \'The\npower of learning the Veda also p. 208 belongs to such sons.\' None of my MSS.\nof the text has these words, and they are suspicious, because the phrase \'Now\nthey quote also\' usually precedes verses only. The Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat\nMSS., except K., omit these and the next Sutra too.\n\n[208:4](sbe1454.htm#fr_1032) Vasish _th_ a XIII, 22, 32-35; Vish _n_ u XXX,\n23. Govinda explains agnyutpata, \'on the appearance of meteor,\' by \'if a fire\nbreaks out in the village.\'\n\n[208:5](sbe1454.htm#fr_1033) Vasish _th_ a XIII, 17, 30; Vish _n_ u XXX, 7,\n13; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 11, 31; I, 3, 10, 17.\n\n[208:6](sbe1454.htm#fr_1034) Gautama XVI, 41.\n\n[209:7](sbe1454.htm#fr_1035) Govinda takes ahoratrayo _s_ _k_ a tatkalam to\nmean until the end of the day or night.\n\n[209:8](sbe1454.htm#fr_1036) Vasish _th_ a XIII, 15. Govinda adds that the\nrecitation must be stopped as soon as the invitation to a _S_ raddha is\nreceived.\n\n[209:9](sbe1454.htm#fr_1037) Vasish _th_ a XIII, 31.\n\n[209:10](sbe1454.htm#fr_1038) Vasish _th_ a XIII, 16. The word \'for\' used in\nthis Sutra gives the reason for the rule in Sutra 8.\n\n[209:12](sbe1454.htm#fr_1039) \'This (rule) refers to a student who has not\nreturned home. But on one who has returned home it is obligatory to interrupt\nthe Veda-study until he becomes pure. Here he calls the sub-teacher\n(upadhyaya) "father," because he gives the Veda. For (an interruption of)\ntwelve days\' duration is prescribed on (the death of) a real father (by the\nSutra); "on the death of the mother, the father, and the teacher twelve\ndays."\'--Govinda.\n\n[209:13](sbe1454.htm#fr_1040) Vasish _th_ a II, 5. This Sutra is intended to\nshow how the p. 210 Upadhyaya can be called a father. Govinda states that the\nprecise meaning of anu _k_ ana, \'versed or learned in the Veda,\' is \'one who\nknows the Veda, its meaning, and the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas: See also Baudhayana G _ri_ hya-\nsutra I, 10, 5.\n\n[210:15](sbe1454.htm#fr_1041) Vasish _th_ a XVIII, 12.

The explanation of the\nterm Parvaday is given below, Sutra 22.\n\n[210:18](sbe1454.htm#fr_1044) Vish _n_ u LXIX, 1.\n\n[211:22](sbe1454.htm#fr_1045) Vish _n_ u XXX, 29-30. In accordance with the\npractice usual in Vedic works the best MSS. of the text repeat the beginning\nof each Ka _n_ _d_ ika at the end of the Pra _s_ na, giving the last first.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Adhyaya 1, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 1](sbe1455.htm)\n\n'
