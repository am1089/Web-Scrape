But there is guidance (of the pra _n_ as) by fire, &c., on account of\nthat being declared by scripture.\n\nHere there arises a discussion whether the pra _n_ as of which we have been\ntreating are able to produce their effects by their own power or only in so\nfar as guided by divinities.--The purvapakshin maintains that the pra _n_ as\nbeing endowed with the capacity of producing their effects act from their own\npower. If we, moreover, admitted that the pra _n_ as act only in so far as\nguided by divinities, it would follow that those guiding divinities are the\nenjoyers (of the fruits of the actions), and the individual soul would thus\ncease to be an enjoyer. Hence the pra _n_ as act from their own power.--To\nthis we reply as follows. 'But there takes place guidance by fire,' &c.--The\nword 'but' excludes the purvapaksha. The different classes of organs, speech,\n&c., the Sutra says, enter on their peculiar activities, guided by the\ndivinities animating fire, and so on. The words, 'on account of that being\ndeclared by scripture,' state the reason. For different passages declare this,\ncp. Ait. \xc3\x82r, II, 4, 2, 4, 'Agni having become speech entered the mouth.' This\nstatement about Agni (fire) becoming speech and entering the mouth is made on\nthe assumption of Agni acting as a ruler with his divine Self (not as a mere\nelement). For if we abstract from the connexion with the divinity we do not\nsee that there is any special connexion of fire either with speech or the\nmouth. The subsequent passages, 'Vayu having become breath entered into the\nnostrils,' &c, are to be explained in the same way.\n\np. 92\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--This conclusion is confirmed by other passages also,\nsuch as 'Speech is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman; that foot shines with\nAgni as its light and warms' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 18, 3), which passage declares\nthat speech is made of the light of Agni. Other passages intimate the same\nthing by declaring that speech, &c., pass over into Agni, &c., cp. B _ri_. Up.\nI, 3, 12, 'He carried speech across first; when speech had become freed from\ndeath it became Agni.' Everywhere the enumeration of speech and so on on the\none side and Agni and so on on the other side--wherein is implied a\ndistinction of the personal and the divine element--proceeds on the ground of\nthe same relation (viz. of that which is guided and that which guides). Sm\n_ri_ ti-passages also declare at length that speech, &c., are guided by Agni\nand the other divinities, cp. for instance,' Brahma _n_ as knowing the truth\ncall speech the personal element, that which is spoken the natural element and\nfire (Agni) the divine element.'--The assertion that the pra _n_ as being\nendowed with the capability of producing their effects act from their own\npower is unfounded, as we see that some things which possess the capability of\nmotion, e.g. cars, actually move only if dragged by bulls and the like. Hence,\nas both alternatives are possible 1, we decide on the ground of scripture that\nthe pra _n_ as act under the guidance of the divinities.--The next Sutra\nrefutes the assertion that from the fact of the divinities guiding the pra _n_\nas it would follow that they--and not the embodied soul--are the enjoyers.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[92:1](sbe38068.htm#fr_60) Viz. that something should act by itself, and that\nit should act under guidance only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 15](sbe38069.htm)\n\n"
