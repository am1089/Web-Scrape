The chest which has the sky for its circumference and the earth for its\nbottom, does not decay, for the quarters are its sides, and heaven its lid\nabove. That chest is a treasury, and all things are within it.\n\n2\\. Its eastern quarter is called _G_ uhu, its southern Sahamana, its western\nRa _g_ \xc3\xb1i, its northern Subhuta 2. The child of those quarters is Vayu, the\nair, and he who knows that the air is indeed the child of the quarters, never\nweeps for his sons. 'I know the wind to be the child of the quarters, may I\nnever weep for my sons.'\n\n3\\. 'I turn to the imperishable chest with such and such and such 3.' 'I turn\nto the Pra _n_ a (life) with such and such and such.' 'I turn to Bhu _h_ with\nsuch and such and such.' 'I turn to Bhuva _h_ with such and such and such.' 'I\nturn to Sva _h_ with such and such and such.'\n\n4\\. 'When I said, I turn to Pra _n_ a, then Pra _n_ a means all whatever\nexists here--to that I turn.'\n\n5\\. 'When I said, I turn to Bhu _h_ , what I said is, I turn to the earth, the\nsky, and heaven.'\n\np. 50\n\n6\\. 'When I said, I turn to Bhuva _h_ , what I said is, I turn to Agni (fire),\nVayu (air), \xc3\x82ditya (sun).'\n\n7\\. 'When I said, I turn to Sva _h_ , what I said is, I turn to the _Ri_ _g_\n-veda, Ya _g_ ur-veda, and Sama-veda. That is what I said, yea, that is what I\nsaid.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[49:1](sbe01073.htm#fr_183) The object of this section, the Ko _s_ avi _g_\n\xc3\xb1ana, is to show how the promise made in III, 13, 6, 'that a strong son should\nbe born in a man's family,' is to be fulfilled.\n\n[49:2](sbe01073.htm#fr_184) These names are explained by the commentator as\nfollows: Because people offer libations ( _g_ uhvati), turning to the east,\ntherefore it is called _G_ uhu. Because evil doers suffer (sahante) in the\ntown of Yama, which is in the south, therefore it is called Sahamana. The\nwestern quarter is called Ra _g_ \xc3\xb1i, either because it is sacred to king Varu\n_n_ a (ra _g_ an), or on account of the red colour (ra _g_ a) of the twilight.\nThe north is called Subhuta, because wealthy beings (bhutimat), like Kuvera\n&c., reside there.\n\n[49:3](sbe01073.htm#fr_185) Here the names of the sons are to be pronounced.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 16](sbe01074.htm)\n\n"
