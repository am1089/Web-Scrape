Referring to deaths and births, they declare that the impurity of Sapi _n_\n_d_ as lasts ten days; excepting officiating priests, men who have performed\nthe initiatory ceremony of a Soma-sacrifice, and students of the Veda. 1\n\n2\\. But amongst Sapi _n_ _d_ as Sapi _n_ _d_ a-relationship (extends) to the\nseventh person. 2\n\n3\\. (If children die) before the completion of the seventh month or before\nteething, (the relatives) shall bathe. 3\n\n4\\. In (the case of a child) that dies before the completion of its third year\nor before teething, offerings of funeral cakes and water are not prescribed,\nand one should not burn its (body); 4\n\n5\\. Nor when unmarried maidens die.\n\n6\\. Some do it in the case of married daughters. 6\n\n7\\. That (is done) in order to gain the good-will 7\n\np. 178\n\nof the people. Women are considered to have no business with the sacred texts.\n\n8\\. 'The relatives of unmarried women become pure after three days. But the\nuterine brothers become pure by (following) the rule mentioned before.' 8\n\n9\\. Moreover, the great-grandfather, the grand-father, the father, oneself,\nthe uterine brothers, the son by a wife of equal caste, the grandson, (and)\nthe great-grandson--these they call Sapi _n_ _d_ as, but not the (great-\ngrandson's) son;--and amongst these a son and a son's son (together with their\nfather are) sharers of an undivided oblation. 9\n\n10\\. The sharers of divided oblations they call Sakulyas. 10\n\np. 179\n\n11\\. If no other (relations) are living, the property (of a deceased male)\ndescends to them (the Sapi _n_ _d_ as). 11\n\n12\\. On failure of Sapi _n_ _d_ as, the Sakulyas (inherit). 12\n\n13\\. On failure of them, the teacher who (holds the place of a spiritual)\nfather, a pupil, or an officiating priest shall take it, 13\n\n14\\. On failure of them, the king. Let him give that property to persons well-\nversed in the three Vedas. 14\n\n15\\. But the king should never take for himself the property of a Brahma _n_\na. 15\n\n16\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): The property of a Brahma _n_ a\ndestroys (him who\n\np. 180\n\ntakes it), together with sons and grandsons; poison kills one man only.\n(Therefore) they do not declare poison to be (the worst) poison. The property\nof a Brahma _n_ a is called (the worst) poison.'\n\n17\\. If a birth and a death occur together, one. and the same period of ten\n(days and) nights (shall serve for both).\n\n18\\. Now if (other deaths or births) happen before the completion of the ten\n(days and) nights (of impurity), the first period of ten (days and) nights\n(shall suffice, provided the new cause of impurity occurs) before the end of\nthe ninth day. 18\n\n19\\. On a birth, indeed, the parents (alone) become impure during ten days. 19\n\n20\\. Some (declare that) the mother (alone becomes impure), because (people)\navoid (lying-in women alone). 20\n\n21\\. Others (say that) the father (alone becomes impure) because the semen is\nthe chief cause (of the generation). 21\n\n22\\. For sons who were born without mothers, are mentioned in the revealed\ntexts.\n\n23\\. But (the correct opinion is that) both the parents (become impure)\nbecause they are equally connected (with the event).\n\np. 181\n\n24\\. But when a death (has happened, the relatives of the deceased), allowing\nthe youngest to begin, shall pass their sacrificial threads over the right\nshoulder and under the left arm, descend into the water at a bathing-place,\nsubmerge (their bodies), emerge (out of the water), ascend the bank, sip\nwater, pour out libations for the (deceased, repeating the last four acts)\nseverally three times thereafter, ascend the bank, sip water, touch a coal,\nwater or the like at the door of their house, and sit during ten days on mats,\neating food that does not contain pungent condiments or salt. 24\n\n25\\. (Let him perform) a funeral sacrifice on the eleventh or the twelfth\n(day). 25\n\n26\\. In (performing) the remaining rites (one should) conform to (the customs\nof) the people. 26\n\n27\\. In case of a (death) let him also keep (a period of impurity) for\n(persons who are) not (his) Sapi _n_ _d_ as, according to the degree of\nnearness, three (days and) nights, a day and a night, one day and so forth, 27\n\np. 182\n\n28\\. For a teacher, a sub-teacher (upadhyaya), and their sons, three (days\nand) nights, 28\n\n29\\. Likewise for officiating priests, 29\n\n30\\. Let hire keep. on account of a pupil, for one who has the same spiritual\nguide, for a fellow-student (sabrahma _k_ arin) three (days and) nights, one\nday and a night, one day and so forth (as periods of impurity). 30\n\n31\\. On a miscarriage females (remain impure) as many (days and) nights as\nmonths (elapsed after conception). 31\n\n32\\. If he unintentionally touches the corpse of a stranger, he becomes at\nonce pure after bathing dressed in his clothes.\n\n33\\. (If he does it) intentionally, (he will remain impure) during three (days\nand) nights.\n\n34\\. And (the same rules apply if he touches a woman) during her courses. 34\n\n35\\. A son who is born from (intercourse with a temporarily unclean woman)\nbecomes an Abhi _s_ asta. Thereby the penances (to be performed) by him have\nbeen explained.\n\np. 183\n\n36\\. On touching one who sells the Veda, a sacrificial post, an outcast, a\nfuneral pile, a dog, or a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala he shall bathe. 36\n\n37\\. Now if a worm is produced in an open wound that is filled with pus and\nsanies, how shall, in that case, a penance be performed? 37\n\n38\\. He who is bitten by a worm will become pure on bathing (daily) during\nthree days and drinking (a mixture of) cow's urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk,\nbutter, and water boiled with Ku _s_ a grass.\n\n39\\. He who has been touched by a dog shall bathe dressed in his clothes; 39\n\n40\\. Or he becomes pure by washing that spot (where he has been touched), by\ntouching it with fire, by (afterwards) again washing it and his feet, and by\nsipping water.\n\n41\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'But a Brahma _n_ a who has\nbeen bitten by a dog, is purified if he goes to a river that flows into the\nocean, (bathes there and) suppresses his breath one hundred times and\n(afterwards) eats clarified butter. He will (also) become pure at, once on\nbathing (in water brought) in golden or silver (vessels), or in a cow's horn,\nor in new (earthen pots).' 41\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[177:1](sbe1444.htm#fr_888) **11**. Vasish _th_ a IV, 16. Officiating priests,\nSoma-sacrificers, and students do not become impure by deaths or births\noccurring among their relatives; see Vasish _th_ a XIX, 48; Gautama XIV, 1.\n\n[177:2](sbe1444.htm#fr_889) Vasish _th_ a IV, 17. For the specification of the\nextent of the Sapi _n_ _d_ a-relationship, see below, Sutra 9.\n\n[177:3](sbe1444.htm#fr_890) Vish _n_ u XXII, 27.\n\n[177:4](sbe1444.htm#fr_891) Vish _n_ u XXII, 28; Gautama XIV, 34, 43.\n\n[177:6](sbe1444.htm#fr_892) Gautama XIV, 36. 'That refers to the Sapi _n_ _d_\nas on the father's side.'--Govinda.\n\n[177:7](sbe1444.htm#fr_893) Manu IX, 18.\n\n[178:8](sbe1444.htm#fr_894) This verse, which occurs in all my MSS. of the\ntext, is left out in the two copies of Govinda's commentary.\n\n[178:9](sbe1444.htm#fr_895) Colebrooke, Dayabhaga XI, 1, 37; V. Digest\nCCCXCVII. The text on which Colebrooke's two versions are based differs from\nthat of my MSS. and of Govinda by reading avibhaktadayadan instead of tesha\n_m_ _k_ a putrapautram [v. l. \xc2\xb0pautrakam] avibhaktadayam. The meaning of the\nlatter clause, which is placed parenthetically before sapi _n_ _d_ an a _k_\nakshate, '(these) they call Sapi _n_ _d_ as,' seems to be that a father with\nhis son and grandson share the cakes offered at one funeral sacrifice by the\nfourth descendant. Its object is to show that the group called Sapi _n_ _d_ as\nconsists of two such subdivisions, between whom the middlemost forms the\nconnecting link. For the middlemost, the svayam, 'oneself,' of the text, first\noffers the cakes to his three ancestors and later receives the cakes, together\nwith his first two descendants, from his great-grandson. Govinda gives no\nhelp. He merely remarks that the Sutra contains a paribhasha or technical rule\nof interpretation, and that the words api _k_ a, 'moreover,' indicate that it\nis an expansion of Sutra 2.\n\n[178:10](sbe1444.htm#fr_896) Colebrooke, loc. cit. According to _G_\nimutavahana the Sakulyas are the three ascendants beyond the great-grandfather\nand the three descendants beyond the great-grandson. Others, among p. 179 whom\nGovinda takes his place, explain the word sakulya to mean 'members of one\nfamily' in general. Govinda says, sambandhavi _s_ esha _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ane sati sapi\n_n_ _d_ a u _k_ yante sambandhamatra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ane sakulya _h_ || Ata _s_ _k_ a\nsapi _n_ _d_ a api sakulya _h_ || 'If a particular relationship is known, they\nare called Sapi _n_ _d_ as; and if (the fact) only is known that relationship\nexists, Sakulyas. Hence the Sapi _n_ _d_ as are also Sakulyas.'\n\n[179:11](sbe1444.htm#fr_897) Colebrooke, loc. cit. Both the Dayabhaga and the\nDigest read satsvanga _g_ eshu, 'when there is male issue,' and the\nViramitrodaya, fol. 218, p. 2, l. 7, agrees with them. The MSS. read all satsv\nanyeshu, which may, however, be taken with Govinda for asatsv anyeshu, because\nthe preceding word ends in _e_. Govinda explains anyeshu, 'others,' by\naurasadishu, 'legitimate sons of the body, and so forth.'\n\n[179:12](sbe1444.htm#fr_898) Colebrooke, Dayabhaga, loc. cit. The digest omits\nthis Sutra.\n\n[179:13](sbe1444.htm#fr_899) Colebrooke, loc. cit. Gimutavahana wrongly reads\npita _k_ a _k_ arya _h_ , 'the father and the teacher.' Govinda gives the\nexplanation adopted above. Regarding the spiritual fatherhood of the teacher,\nsee e.g. Vasish _th_ a II, 4.\n\n[179:14](sbe1444.htm#fr_900) Colebrooke, loc. ca. Govinda reads satsvam, 'the\nproperty of a holy man,' instead of tatsvam, 'that property.'\n\n[179:15](sbe1444.htm#fr_901) Colebrooke V, Dig. CCCCXLIV; Vasish _th_ a XVII,\n86.\n\n[180:18](sbe1444.htm#fr_902) Vasish _th_ a IV, 23-25. Govinda points out that\nin case the second birth or death happens after the completion of the ninth\nday, the rule given (Gautama XIV, 7) applies.\n\n[180:19](sbe1444.htm#fr_903) Vasish _th_ a IV, 20-21.\n\n[180:20](sbe1444.htm#fr_904) Vasish _th_ a IV, 21-22. Tatparihara _n_ at,\nliterally, 'because she is avoided, i.e. because people avoid newly-confined\nwomen (not their husbands).'--Govinda.\n\n[180:21](sbe1444.htm#fr_905) E.g. Agastya and Vasish _th_ a. See Rig-veda VII,\n33, 11, and Saya _n_ a's commentary thereon.\n\n[181:24](sbe1444.htm#fr_906) Vasish _th_ a IV, 9-15. When the libations of\nwater are poured out, the name of the deceased must be pronounced. Govinda\ncorrectly states that iti, 'or the like,' which stands after 'a coal, water,'\nis intended to include 'cowdung, and yellow mustard seed,' which are mentioned\nby Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 13. Regarding the clause sak _ri_ ttri _h_ ,\n'(repeating these last four acts) severally three times,' see \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6,\n15, 10.\n\n[181:25](sbe1444.htm#fr_907) Vish _n_ u XXI, 2 seq., and especially 19.\n\n[181:26](sbe1444.htm#fr_908) Govinda, in explanation of this Sutra, refers to\nthe last words of \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 15, 10, where it is said that relatives\nshall perform those rites for the dead which the women declare to be\nnecessary,' and to \xc3\x82pastamba II, II, 29, 15.\n\n[181:27](sbe1444.htm#fr_909) Gautama XIV, 20. Govinda is of opinion that the\nduration of the impurity shall depend on the good qualities, learning, &c. of\nthe deceased.\n\n[182:28](sbe1444.htm#fr_910) Vish _n_ u XXII, 42, 44. Govinda asserts that the\nimpurity on account of an Upadhyaya lasts one night, together with the\npreceding and following days, and on account of a teacher's or Upadhyaya's\nsons one day only. It looks as if he had read the words pakshi _n_ yekaham in\nhis text.\n\n[182:29](sbe1444.htm#fr_911) Govinda asserts that ka, 'likewise,' indicates\nthat the rule applies also on the death of persons for whom one sacrifices.\n\n[182:30](sbe1444.htm#fr_912) Vish _n_ u XXII, 44. Govinda explains satirthya\nto mean 'one who has the same guru or spiritual guide,' while according to\nothers it means 'one who studies under the same sub-teacher' (upadhyaya). See\nalso the Ka _s_ ika on Pa _n_ ini IV, 4, 117, and note.\n\n[182:31](sbe1444.htm#fr_913) Vish _n_ u XXII, 25. 3233. Gautama XIV, 27.\n\n[182:34](sbe1444.htm#fr_914) Vish _n_ u XXII, 69.\n\n[183:36](sbe1444.htm#fr_915) This verse, which is another version of I, 5, 9,\n5, is left out in the Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS.; I consider its genuineness\nvery doubtful.\n\n[183:37](sbe1444.htm#fr_916) Vasish _th_ a XVIII, 16.\n\n[183:39](sbe1444.htm#fr_917)-40. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 15, 16-17. Govinda, too,\nstates that the second mode of purification is to be adopted, if the dog\ntouches any part of the body below the navel.\n\n[183:41](sbe1444.htm#fr_918) Vasish _th_ a XXIII, 31.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 5, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 12](sbe1445.htm)\n\n"
