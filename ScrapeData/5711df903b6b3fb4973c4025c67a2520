We will separately explain the various penances for the several offences,\nboth heavier and lighter ones.\n\n2\\. Let him prescribe whatever may be befitting for each (case),--heavier\n(penances) for great (crimes) and easier ones for trivial (faults).\n\n3\\. Let him perform the penances according to the rule given in the Institutes\n(of the Sacred Law in cases) where an offence has been committed with the\norgan or with the feet (and) the arms, through 3\n\np. 313\n\nthoughts or speech, through the ear, the skin, the nose or the eye.\n\n4\\. Or, in (the case of) transgressions committed through the organ of vision,\nof hearing, of sensation, of smelling, and through thoughts, he also becomes\npure by three suppressions of the breath.\n\n5\\. In case (he commits the offences) of eating the food of a _S_ udra or of\ncohabiting with a _S_ udra female, severally, he must perform, during seven\ndays, seven suppressions of the breath on each day. 5\n\n6\\. For partaking of food unfit for eating or drinking, and for selling\nforbidden merchandise, excepting honey, meat, clarified butter, oil, pungent\ncondiments and bad food, and for similar (offences), he must perform, during\ntwelve days, twelve suppressions of the breath on each day. 6\n\n7\\. For other transgressions excepting mortal sins (pataka), crimes causing\nloss of caste (pataniya), and the minor faults (called upapataka), he must\nperform, during half a month, twelve suppressions of the breath on each day. 7\n\n8\\. For other transgressions excepting mortal sins 8\n\np. 314\n\nand crimes causing loss of caste, he must perform, during twelve periods of\ntwelve days, twelve suppressions of the breath on each day.\n\n9\\. For other transgressions excepting mortal sins he must perform, during\ntwelve half-months, twelve suppressions of the breath on each day. 9\n\n10\\. But for mortal sins he must perform, during a year, twelve suppressions\nof the breath on each day.\n\n11\\. Let him give his daughter, while she still goes naked, to a man who has\nnot broken the vow of chastity and who possesses good qualities, or even to\none destitute of good qualities; let him not keep (the maiden) in (his house)\nafter she has reached the age of puberty. 11\n\n12\\. He who does not give away a marriageable daughter during three years\ndoubtlessly contracts a guilt equal to (that of) destroying an embryo.\n\n13\\. Such will be the case if anybody asks her in marriage, and also if nobody\ndemands her. Manu has declared that at each appearance of the menses (the\nfather incurs the guilt of) a mortal sin.\n\n14\\. Three years let a marriageable damsel wait for the order of her father.\nBut after (that) time let her choose for herself in the fourth year a husband\n(of) equal (rank). If no man (of) equal (rank) be found, she may take even one\ndestitute of good qualities.\n\n15\\. If a damsel has been abducted by force, and has not been wedded with\nsacred texts, she may lawfully be given to another man; she is even like a\nmaiden. 15\n\np. 315\n\n16\\. If, after (a damsel) has been given away, or even after (the nuptial\nsacrifices) have been offered, the husband dies, she who (thus) has left (her\nfather's house) and has returned, may be again wedded according to the rule\napplicable to second weddings, provided the marriage had not been consummated.\n16\n\n17\\. He who does not approach, during three years, a wife who is marriageable,\nincurs, without doubt, a guilt equal to that of destroying an embryo.\n\n18\\. But the ancestors of that man who does not approach his wife who bathed\nafter her temporary uncleanness, though he dwells near her, lie during that\nmonth in the menstrual excretions (of the wife).\n\n19\\. They declare that the guilt of the husband who does not approach his wife\nin due season, of him who approaches her during her temporary uncleanness, and\nof him who commits an unnatural crime (with her), is equally (great).\n\n20\\. Let him proclaim in the village a wife who, being obdurate against her\nhusband, makes herself sterile, as one who destroys embryos, and drive her\nfrom his house.\n\n21\\. But for the transgression of that husband who does not approach a wife\nwho bathed after temporary uncleanness, (the performance of) one hundred\nsuppressions of the breath is prescribed (as a penance). 21\n\np. 316\n\n22\\. Seated with Ku _s_ a grass in his hands, let him repeatedly suppress his\nbreath, and again and again recite purificatory texts, the Vyah _ri_ tis, the\nsyllable Om, and the daily portion of the Veda. 22\n\n23\\. Always intent on the practice of Yoga, let him again and again suppress\nhis breath. (Thus) he performs the highest austerity up to the ends of his\nhair and up to the ends of his nails.\n\n24\\. Through the obstruction (of the respiration) air is generated, through\nair fire is produced, then through heat water is formed; hence he is\ninternally purified by (those) three.\n\n25\\. Through the practice of Yoga (true) knowledge is obtained, Yoga is the\nsum of the sacred law, all good qualities are gained through Yoga; therefore\nlet him always be absorbed in the practice of Yoga. 25\n\n26\\. The Vedas likewise begin with the syllable Om, and they end with the\nsyllable Om. The syllable Om and the Vyah _ri_ tis are the eternal,\neverlasting Brahman. 26\n\n27\\. For him who is constantly engaged in (reciting) the syllable Om, the\nseven Vyah _ri_ tis, and the three-footed Gayatri, no danger exists anywhere.\n27\n\n28\\. If, restraining his breath, he thrice recites the Gayatri together with\nthe syllable Om and with the (text called) _S_ iras, that is called one\nsuppression of breath. 28\n\n29\\. But sixteen suppressions of breath, accompanied 29\n\np. 317\n\nby (the recitation of) the Vyah _ri_ tis and of the syllable Om, repeated\ndaily, purify after a month even the slayer of a learned Brahma _n_ a.\n\n30\\. That is the highest austerity, that is the best description of the sacred\nlaw. That, indeed, is the best means of removing all sin.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[312:3](sbe1483.htm#fr_1399) The construction is certainly elliptical. I\nunderstand tatra with the first half-verse. Govinda separates the two half-\nverses, yad upasthak _ri_ tam papa _m_ , &c., from the first, and reads at the\nend p. 313 of the half-verse pra _n_ ayaman sama _k_ aret, 'one should perform\nsuppressions of the breath (in even or equal numbers).'\n\n[313:5](sbe1483.htm#fr_1400) Govinda tries to reconcile this rule with the one\ngiven above, I, I, 2, 7, by assuming that the word _S_ udra denotes here a\nBrahma _n_ a who lives like a _S_ udra and neglects his sacred duties.\n\n[313:6](sbe1483.htm#fr_1401) I read, conjecturally, dvada _s_ aham, 'twelve\ndays.' The MSS. of the text have dvada _s_ a dvada _s_ aham, or corruptions\npointing to this reading, and C. I. reads ardhamasam. Regarding avaranna, 'bad\nfood,' see note on \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 15, 16.\n\n[313:7](sbe1483.htm#fr_1402) I read, conjecturally, ardhamasa _m_ , 'half a\nmonth;' D. has ardhamasan; K. dvada _s_ aha _m_ ; M. dvada _s_ ardhamasam; C.\nI. dvada _s_ ardhamasan, which is explained by sha _n_ masan.\n\n[313:8](sbe1483.htm#fr_1403) I read with M. dvada _s_ a dvada _s_ ahan. D. K.\nhave dvada _s_ aham. The commentary omits the Sutra altogether.\n\n[314:9](sbe1483.htm#fr_1404) I read with D., K., and M., dvada _s_ ardhamasan.\nThe commentary omits also this Sutra.\n\n[314:11](sbe1483.htm#fr_1405) Vasish _th_ a XVII, 67-71, and above.\n\n[314:15](sbe1483.htm#fr_1406) Vasish _th_ a XVII, 73.\n\n[315:16](sbe1483.htm#fr_1407) Vasish _th_ a XVII, 74.\n\n[315:21](sbe1483.htm#fr_1408) The MSS. of the text read, _ri_ tusnata _m_ to\nyo bharya _m_ niyata _m_ brahma _k_ ari _n_ im | niyamatikrame tasya pra _n_\nayama _s_ ata _m_ sm _ri_ tam. The commentary omits the first half of the\nverse altogether. The latter, as read in the MSS., gives no sense. It seems to\nme that p. 316 either its end must have been sa _m_ nidhau nopaga _k_ _kh_ ati\n(as in Sutra 17), or that a whole half-verse has been lost.\n\n[316:22](sbe1483.htm#fr_1409)-24. Vasish _th_ a XXV, 4-6.\n\n[316:25](sbe1483.htm#fr_1410) Vasish _th_ a XXV, 8.\n\n[316:26](sbe1483.htm#fr_1411) Vasish _th_ a XXV, 10.\n\n[316:27](sbe1483.htm#fr_1412) Vasish _th_ a XXV, 9.\n\n[316:28](sbe1483.htm#fr_1413) Vasish _th_ a XXV, 13.\n\n[316:29](sbe1483.htm#fr_1414) Vasish _th_ a XXVI, 4.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na IV, Adhyaya 2](sbe1484.htm)\n\n"
