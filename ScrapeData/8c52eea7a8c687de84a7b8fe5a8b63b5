Against vishkandha and kabava (hostile demons).\n\n1\\. Of karsapha and visapha heaven is the father and earth the mother. As, ye\ngods, ye have brought on (the trouble), thus do ye again remove it!  \n2\\. Without fastening the), (the protecting plants?) held fast, thus it has\nbeen arranged by Manu. The vishkandha do I render impotent, like one who gelds\ncattle.  \n3\\. A talisman tied to a reddish thread the active (seers) then do fasten on:\nmay the fastenings render impotent the eager, fiery kabava!  \n4\\. And since, O ye eager (demons), ye walk like gods by the wile of the\nAsuras, the fastening (of the amulet) is destructive to the kabava, as the ape\nto the dog.  \n5\\. I revile thee, the kabava, unto misfortune, (and) shall work harm for\nthee. Accompanied with curses ye shall go out like swift chariots!  \n6\\. A hundred and one vishkandha are spread out along the earth; for these at\nthe beginning they brought out thee, the amulet, that destroys vishkandha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 20.
