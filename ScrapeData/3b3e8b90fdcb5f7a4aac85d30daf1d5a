Shree Krishnu Chund Jee allowed the\nbrahmin to take leave, who brought the message of the Rajas, having first said\nto him, "O divine being! go and say from me to all the Rajas not to be at all\nanxious, as I shall come soon and liberate them." With these words, O great\nking! Shree Krishnu Chund dismissed the brahmin, and having taken Oodho Jee\nwith him, went into the court of the Rajas Oogursen and Soorsen, and mentioned\nall the news he had heard in their presence. On hearing which they were\nsilent; upon this Oodho Jee said, "O great king! do these two things; first,\nrelease the Rajas from the power of Joorasindhoo, and afterwards go and make\narrangements for the sacrifice; because no one, except a Raja, can take part\nin a royal sacrifice; and there are twenty thousand Rajas collected at that\nplace; if you will set them free, they will, without invitation, assist in the\nsacrifice, showing you the greatest respect for your favour to them. O great\nking! if any one else were to conquer the ten quarters of the world, he would\nnot find so many Rajas collected together; it is therefore most advisable that\nyou go to Hustinapoor; and, uniting and consulting with the Panduvus, do what\nis necessary to be done." O great king! Oodho Jee\n\np. 357\n\nafter this again said, "Raja Joorasindhoo is very liberal, and a great\nrespecter and worshipper of the cow and brahmin; every one who asks him for\nany thing receives it; no beggar ever returns disappointed from his presence;\nhe never speaks falsely, and fulfils every promise he makes, and he has the\nstrength of ten thousand elephants; which strength is equal to that of\nBheemsen. Lord! if you go there, take Bheemsen also with you, I have an idea,\nthat he will perish by Bheemsen\'s hand."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--Raja! when Oodho Jee had thus spoken Shree Krishnu Chund,\nhaving taken leave of Rajas Oogursen and Soorsen, said to the descendants of\nJudoo, "Get my army ready, as I shall go to Hustinapoor." On hearing this, the\ndescendants of Judoo arranged and brought the whole army, and Krishnu\naccompanied it with his eight queens.\n\nO great king! when Shree Krishnu Chund, accompanied by his family and army,\nand sounding the great kettledrum, proceeded from the city of Dwarka to\nHustinapoor, the beauty of the scene exceeded all description; in front of all\nwere the castles of the elephants; on the right and left was the protection of\nchariots and horses; in the centre was the seraglio; and in rear of all,\naccompanied by his army, and affording universal protection, came Shree\nKrishnu Chund Jee; Wherever they encamped, a handsome, elegant city of many\ncoss in extent was formed. The Rajas of different countries came in a state of\nalarm to pay visits, and offer presents; and Krishnu, seeing that they were\nterrified, consoled them in every way; at length, having proceeded with this\ngreat pomp and show, Huri arrived with them all in the neighbourhood of\nHustinapoor. Upon this some one went, and said to the Raja Joodisthur, "O\ngreat king! some monarch with a very large army and a great retinue of\nfollowers, has advanced into your country, be pleased to take measures\n\np. 358\n\nquickly for arresting his progress, otherwise he will be here immediately."\n\nThe Raja Joodisthur, O great king! was alarmed at these words and sent his two\nyounger brothers, Nukool and Suhdeo, to confront Krishnu, having given them\nthis instruction, "See and come and inform me what Raja is coming to attack\nus." On receiving the Raja\'s order Suhdeo and Nukool went to see who had come,\nand on their return reported to the Raja, "O lord of our lives! Huri has\ncome." On hearing this the Raja banished all anxiety. Raja Joodisthur, being\ngreatly delighted, sent afterwards for Bheem and Urjoon and said to his four\nbrothers, "Go all of you in advance to meet Krishnu and bring him here with\nyou."\n\nHaving received, O great king! the Raja\'s order, and heard of Krishnu\'s\narrival, the four brothers were very much pleased and taking with them the\nnecessary presents and materials for offering adoration and accompanied by\nlearned pundits, they went forth with music playing, and singing songs to\nbring Krishnu in; at length, having met him with great respect and reverence,\nand offered presents and adoration in the manner prescribed by the Vedas, the\nfour brothers brought Krishnu with them into the city in musical procession,\nspreading silken cloths on the road for him to walk upon, showering down\nflowers of silver and gold, sprinkling perfumes, sandal and rosewater, and\npresenting sweet scents, lamps and consecrated food. The Raja Joodisthur was\nexceedingly gratified to meet Krishnu, and considered that all his wishes in\nlife had been accomplished. After this all persons outside and inside the city\nhad cordial meetings, observing the usual ceremonies, and mutually\ninterchanged civilities and kindnesses, and were in the highest degree\npleased; joy was diffused every where, and Shree Krishnu. Chund, by staying\nthere, made them all happy.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXIII](psa74.htm)\n\n'
