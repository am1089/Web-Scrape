And on account of the two latter (i.e. going and returning) being\nconnected with their Self (i.e. the agent), (the soul is of atomic size).\n\nWe admit that 'passing out' might possibly be attributed to the soul even if\nit does not move, viz. if that expression be taken to mean the soul's ceasing\nto be the ruler of the body, in consequence of the results of its former\nactions having become exhausted; just as somebody when ceasing to be the ruler\nof a village may be said to 'go out.' But the two latter activities, viz.\ngoing and returning, are not possible in the ease of something which does not\nmove; for they are both connected with the own Self (of the agent), going (and\ncoming back) being activities abiding in the agent 1. Now going and coming are\npossible for a being that is not of medium size, only if it is of atomic size.\nAnd as going and coming must be taken in their literal sense, we conclude that\nthe passing out also means nothing but the soul's actual moving out of the\nbody. For the soul cannot go and return without first having moved out of the\nbody. Moreover certain parts of the body are mentioned as the points from\nwhich the soul starts in passing out, viz. in the following passage, 'Either\nfrom the eye or from the skull or from other places of the body (the Self\npasses out)' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 2). Other passages mention that the embodied\nsoul goes and comes within the body also; so, for instance, 'He taking with\nhim those elements of light descends into the heart' B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 1);\n'Having assumed light he again goes to his place' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 11).--\nThereby the atomic size of the soul is established as well.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[36:1](sbe38021.htm#fr_23) Going is known to be an activity inherent in the\nagent, from the fact of its producing effects inherent in him, such as his\nconjunction with--or disjunction from--other things.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 21](sbe38022.htm)\n\n"
