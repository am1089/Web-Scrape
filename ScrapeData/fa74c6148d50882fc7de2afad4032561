According to Nand., the use of the term sarva, \'all,\' implies that _S_\nudras may also follow the occupations of a Vai _s_ ya, tillage and the rest,\nas ordained by Devala.\n\n16\\. The term Guru, \'superior,\' generally denotes the parents and the teacher,\nor Guru in the narrower sense of the term; see XXXI, 1, 2.

Chapters III-XVIII contain the section on vyavahara,\n\'jurisprudence.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 14\n\n3\\. And to keep the four castes and the four orders[1] in the practice of\ntheir several duties.\n\n4\\. Let the king fix his abode in a district containing open plains, fit for\ncattle, and abounding in grain;\n\n5\\. And inhabited by many Vaisyas and _S_ udras.\n\n6\\. There let him reside in a stronghold (the strength of which consists)\neither in (its being surrounded by) a desert, or in (a throng of) armed\n\n[3. 1 Of student, householder, hermit, and ascetic.\n\n5\\. \'And there should be many virtuous men in it, as stated by Manu, VII, 69.\'\n(Nand.)]\n\np. 15\n\nmen, or in fortifications (of stone, brick, or others), or in water (enclosing\nit on all sides), or in trees, or in mountains (sheltering it against a\nforeign invasion).\n\n7\\. (While he resides) there, let him appoint chiefs (or governors) in every\nvillage;\n\n8\\. Also, lords of every ten villages;\n\n9\\. And lords of every hundred villages;\n\n10\\. And lords of a whole district.\n\n11\\. If any offence has been committed in a village, let the lord of that\nvillage suppress the evil (and give redress to those that have been wronged).\n\n12\\. If he is unable to do so, let him announce it to the lord of ten\nvillages;\n\n13\\. If he too is unable, let him announce it to the lord of a hundred\nvillages;\n\n14\\. If he too is unable, let him announce it to the lord of the whole\ndistrict.\n\n15\\. The lord of the whole district must eradicate the evil to the best of his\npower.\n\n16\\. Let the king appoint able officials for the working of his mines, for the\nlevying of taxes and of the fares to be paid at ferries, and for his elephants\nand forests.\n\n17\\. (Let him appoint) pious persons for performing acts of piety (such as\nbestowing gifts on the indigent, and the like);\n\n18\\. Skilled men for financial business (such as examining gold and other\nprecious metals);\n\n[11. See 67 and Dr. Buhler\'s note on \xc3\x82past. II, 10, 26, 8.\n\n16\\. The term nagavana, which has been translated as a Dvandva compound,\ndenoting elephants and forests, may also be taken to mean \'forests in which\nthere are elephants;\' or naga may mean \'situated in the mountains\' or I a\nmountain fort.\' (Nand.)\n\n18\\. Or, \'he must appoint men skilled in logic as his advisers in knotty\npoints of argument.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 16\n\n19\\. Brave men for fighting;\n\n20\\. Stern men for acts of rigour (such as beating and killing);\n\n21\\. Eunuchs for his wives (as their guardians).\n\n22\\. He must take from his subjects as taxes a sixth part every year of the\ngrain;\n\n23\\. And (a sixth part) of all (other) seeds;\n\n24\\. Two in the hundred, of cattle, gold, and clothes;\n\n25\\. A sixth part of flesh, honey, clarified butter, herbs, perfumes, flowers,\nroots, fruits, liquids and condiments, wood, leaves (of the Palmyra, tree and\nothers), skins, earthen pots, stone vessels, and anything made of split\nbamboo.\n\n26\\. Let him not levy any tax upon Brahma _n_ as.\n\n27\\. For they pay taxes to him in the shape of their pious acts.\n\n28\\. A sixth part both of the virtuous deeds and of the iniquitous acts\ncommitted by his subjects goes to the king.\n\n29\\. Let him take a tenth part of (the price of) marketable commodities (sold)\nin his own country;\n\n30\\. And a twentieth part of (the price of) goods (sold) in another country.\n\n31\\. Any (seller or buyer) who (fraudulently) avoids a toll-house (situated on\nhis road), shall lose all his goods.\n\n[23. This rule relates to _S_ yamaka grain and other sorts of grain produced\nin the rainy season. (Nand.)\n\n25\\. \'Haradatta says that "a sixth part" means "a sixtieth part." But this is\nwrong, as shown by M. VII, 131.\' (Nand.) Haradatta\'s false interpretation was\nmost likely called forth by Gaut. X, 2 7.]\n\np. 17\n\n32\\. Artizans (such as blacksmiths), manual labourers (such as carpenters),\nand _S_ udras shall do work for the king for a day in each month.\n\n33\\. The monarch, his council, his fortress, his treasure, his army, his\nrealm, and his ally are the seven constituent elements of a state.\n\n34\\. (The king) must punish those who try to subvert any one among them.\n\n35\\. He must explore, by means of spies, both the state of his own kingdom and\nof his foe\'s.\n\n36\\. Let him show honour to the righteous;\n\n37\\. And let him punish the unrighteous.\n\n38\\. Towards his (neighbour and natural) enemy, his ally (or the power next\nbeyond his enemy), a neutral power (situated beyond the latter), and a power\nsituated between (his natural enemy and an aggressive power): let him adopt\n(alternately), as the occasion and the time require, (the four modes of\nobtaining success, viz.) negotiation, division, presents, and force of arms.\n\n39\\. Let him have resort, as the time demands, to (the six measures of a\nmilitary monarch, viz.) making alliance and waging war, marching to battle and\nsitting encamped, seeking the protection (of a more powerful king) and\ndistributing his forces.\n\n[32. According to Nand., the particle _k_ a, \'and,\' implies that servile\npersons, who get their substance from their employers, are also implied. See\nManu VII, 138.\n\n35\\. The particle _k_ a, according to Nand., is used in order to include the\nkingdoms of an ally and of a neutral prince.\n\n38\\. 1 The term madhyama has been rendered according to Nand.\'s and Kulluka\'s\n(on M. VII, 156) interpretation of it. Kullaka, however, adds, as a further\ncharacteristic, that it denotes a prince, who is equal in strength to one foe,\nbut no match for two when allied.]\n\np. 18\n\n40\\. Let him set out on an expedition in the months of _K_ aitra or Marga _s_\nirsha;\n\n41\\. Or when some calamity has befallen his foe.\n\n42\\. Having conquered the country of his foe, let him not abolish (or\ndisregard) the laws of that country.\n\n43\\. And when he has been attacked by his foe, let him protect his own realm\nto the best of his power.\n\n44\\. There is no higher duty for men of the military caste, than to risk their\nlife in battle.\n\n45\\. Those who have been killed in protecting a cow, or a Brahma _n_ a, or a\nking, or a friend, or their own property, or their own wedded wife, or their\nown life, go to heaven.\n\n46\\. Likewise, those (who have been killed) in trying to prevent mixture of\ncastes (caused by adulterous connections).\n\n47\\. A king having conquered the capital of his foe, should invest there a\nprince of the royal race of that country with the royal dignity.\n\n48\\. Let him not extirpate the royal race\n\n49\\. Unless the royal race bc of ignoble descent.\n\n50\\. He must not take delight in hunting, dice, women, and drinking;\n\n51\\. Nor in defamation and battery.\n\n52\\. And let him not injure his own property (by bootless expenses).\n\n53\\. He must not demolish (whether in his own town, or in the town of his foe\nconquered by him,\n\n[40. The particle va indicates, according to Nand., that he may also set out\nin the month Phalguna.]\n\np. 19\n\nor in a fort) doors which had been built there before his time (by a former\nking).\n\n54\\. He must not bestow largesses upon unworthy persons (such as dancers,\neulogists, bards, and the like).\n\n55\\. Of mines let him take the whole produce.\n\n56\\. Of a treasure-trove he must give one half to the Brahma _n_ as;\n\n57\\. He may deposit the other half in his own treasury.\n\n58\\. A Brahma _n_ a who has found a treasure may keep it entire.\n\n59\\. A Kshatriya (who has found a treasure) must give one fourth of it to the\nking, another fourth to the Brahma _n_ as, and keep half of it to himself\n\n60\\. A Vai _s_ ya (who has found a treasure) must give a fourth part of it to\nthe king, one half to the Brahma _n_ as, and keep the (remaining fourth) part\nto himself.\n\n61\\. A _S_ udra who has found a treasure must divide it into twelve parts, and\ngive five parts to the king, five parts to the Brahma _n_ as, and keep two\nparts to himself.\n\n62\\. Let the king compel him who (having found a treasure) does not announce\nit (to the king) and is found out afterwards, to give up the whole.\n\n63\\. Of a treasure anciently hidden by themselves let (members of) all castes,\nexcepting Brahma _n_ as, give a twelfth part to the king.\n\n64\\. The man who falsely claims property hidden by another to have been hidden\nby himself, shall be\n\n[63. This rule refers to a treasure, which has been found by some one and\nannounced to the king. -The original owner is bound to prove his ownership.\n(Nand.) See "M. VIII, 35.]\n\np. 20\n\ncondemned to pay a fine equal in amount to the property falsely claimed by\nhim.\n\n65\\. The king must protect the property of minors, of (blind, lame or other)\nhelpless persons (who have no guide), and of women (without a guardian).\n\n66\\. Having recovered goods stolen by thieves, let him restore them entire to\ntheir owners, to whatever caste they may belong.\n\n67\\. If he has been unable to recover them, he must pay (their value) out of\nhis own treasury.\n\n68\\. Let him appease the onsets of fate by ceremonies averting evil omens and\npropitiatory ceremonies;\n\n69\\. And the onsets of his foe (let him repel) by force of arms.\n\n70\\. Let him appoint as Purohita (domestic priest) a man conversant with the\nVedas, Epics, the Institutes of Sacred Law, and (the science of) what is\nuseful in life, of a good family, not deficient in limb, and persistent in the\npractice of austerities.\n\n71\\. And (let him appoint) ministers (to help and advise him) in all his\naffairs, who are pure, free from covetousness, attentive, and able.\n\n72\\. Let him try causes himself, accompanied by well-instructed Brahma _n_ as.\n\n73\\. Or let him entrust a Brahma _n_ a, with the judicial business.\n\n74\\. Let the king appoint as judges men of good\n\n[70. \'The science of what is useful in life\' comprises the fine arts, except\nmusic, and all technical knowledge.\n\n74\\. According to Nand., the particle _k_ a indicates that the judges should\nbe well acquainted, likewise, with the sacred revelation, {footnote p. 21} and\nintent upon performing their daily study of the Veda, as ordained by Ya _g_\n\xc3\xb1avalkya, II, 2.]\n\np. 21\n\nfamilies, for whom the ceremonies (of initiation and so forth) have been\nperformed, and who are eager in keeping religious vows, impartial towards\nfriend and foe, and not likely to be corrupted by litigants either by\n(ministering to their) lustful desires or by (stimulating them to) wrath or by\n(exciting their) avarice or by other (such practices).\n\n75\\. Let the king in all matters listen to (the advice of) his astrologers.\n\n76\\. Let him constantly show reverence to the gods and to the Brahma _n_ as.\n\n77\\. Let him honour the aged;\n\n78\\. And let him offer sacrifices;\n\n79\\. And he must not suffer any Brahma _n_ a in his realm to perish with want;\n\n80\\. Nor any other man leading a pious life.\n\n81\\. Let him bestow landed property upon Brahma _n_ as.\n\n82\\. To those upon whom he has bestowed (land) he must give a document,\ndestined for the information of a future ruler, which must be written upon a\npiece of (cotton) cloth, or a copper-plate, and must contain the names of his\n(three) immediate ancestors, a declaration of the extent of the land, and an\nimprecation against him who should appropriate the\n\n[75. According to Nand., the particle ka indicates that the king\'s ministers\nshould also consult the astrologers.\n\n76\\. \'The particle ka is used here in order to imply that the king should\nbestow presents upon the Brahma _n_ as, as Ordained by Manu, VII, 79.\' (Nand.)\nSee Introduction.\n\n82\\. The repeated use of the particle _k_ a in this Sutra signifies that the\ndocument in question should also contain the name of the {footnote p. 22}\ndonor, the date of the donation, and the words, written in the donor\'s own\nhand, \'What has been written above, by that is my own will declared.\' The term\ndana _kkh_ edopavar _n_ anam, \'containing a declaration of the punishment\nawaiting the robber of a grant,\' may also mean, \'indicating the boundaries\n(such as fields and the like) of the grant.\' The seal must contain the figure\nof a flamingo, boar, or other animal. (Nand.) Numerous grants on copper-\nplates, exactly corresponding to the above description, have been actually\nfound in divers parts of India. See, particularly, Dr. Burnell\'s Elements of\nSouth Indian Palaeography.]\n\np. 22\n\ndonation to himself, and should be signed with his own seal.\n\n83\\. Let him not appropriate to himself landed property bestowed (upon Brahma\n_n_ as) by other (rulers).\n\n84\\. Let him present the Brahma _n_ as with gifts of every kind.\n\n85\\. Let him be on his guard, whatever he may be about.\n\n86\\. Let him be splendid (in apparel and ornaments).\n\n87\\. Let him be conversant with incantations dispelling the effects of poison\nand sickness.\n\n88\\. Let him not test any aliments, that have not been tried before (by his\nattendants, by certain experiments).\n\n89\\. Let him smile before he speaks to any one.\n\n90\\. Let him not frown even upon (criminals) doomed to capital punishment.\n\n91\\. Let him inflict punishments, corresponding to the nature of their\noffences, upon evil-doers.\n\n[83. According to Nand., the particle _k_ a is used in order to include in\nthis prohibition a grant made by himself.\n\n86\\. Nand. proposes a second interpretation of the term sudar _s_ ana besides\nthe one given above, \'he shall often show himself before those desirous of\nseeing him.\' {footnote p. 23} IV. 1-14. M. VIII, 132-138; Y. I, 361-365.]\n\np. 23\n\n92\\. Let him inflict punishments according to justice (either personally or\nthrough his attendants).\n\n93\\. Let him pardon no one for having offended twice.\n\n94\\. He who deviates from his duty must certainly not be left unpunished by\nthe king.\n\n95\\. Where punishment with a black hue and a red eye advances with\nirresistible might, the king deciding causes justly, there the people will\nprosper.\n\n96\\. Let a king in his own domain inflict punishments according to justice,\nchastise foreign foes with rigour, behave without duplicity to his\naffectionate friends, and with lenity to Brahma _n_ as.\n\n97\\. Of a king thus disposed, even though he subsist by gleaning, the fame is\nfar spread in the world, like a drop of oil in the water.\n\n98\\. That king who is pleased when his subjects are joyful, and grieved when\nthey are in grief, will obtain fame in this world, and will be raised to a\nhigh station in heaven after his death.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV.](sbe07006.htm)\n\n'
