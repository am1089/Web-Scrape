It was continued, as they appeared in themselves curious\nillustrations of Indian popular tradition, and in the hope that something\nmight thus be done to rescue them from the danger of oral transmission.\n\nThough varied in their imagery, the changes between the different legends are\nrung upon very few themes, as if purposely confined to what was most familiar\nto the people. The similarity between the incidents in some of these and in\nfavourite European stories is curious; and the leading characteristics\npeculiar to all orthodox fairy tales are here preserved intact. Step-mothers\nare always cruel, and step-sisters their willing instruments; giants and ogres\nalways stupid; youngest daughters more clever than their elder sisters; and\nthe Jackal (like his European cousin the Fox) usually overcomes every\ndifficulty, and proves a bright moral example of the success of wit against\nbrute force--the triumph of mind over matter.\n\nIt is remarkable that in the romances of a country where women are generally\nsupposed by us to be regarded as mere slaves or intriguers, their influence\n(albeit most frequently put to proof behind the scenes) should be made to\nappear so great, and, as a rule, exerted wholly for good; and that, in a land\nwhere despotism has such a firm hold on the hearts of the people, the\nliberties of the subject should be so boldly asserted as by the old Milk-woman\nto the Rajah in 'Little Surya Bai, 1 or the Malee to the Rajah in 'Truth's\nTriumph'; and few, probably, would have expected to find the Hindoos owning\nsuch a romance as 'Brave Seventee Bai'; or to meet with such stories as 'The\nValiant Chatteemaker,' and 'The Blind Man, the Deaf Man, and the Donkey,'\namong a nation which, it has been constantly asserted, possesses no humour, no\nsense of the ridiculous, and cannot understand a joke.\n\nIn 'The Narrator's Narrative' Anna Liberata de Souza's own story is related,\nas much as possible, in her own words of expressive but broken English. She\ndid not, however, tell it in one continuous narrative; it is the sum of many\nconversations I had with her, during the eighteen months that she was with us.\n\nThe legends themselves are altered as little as possible; half their charm,\nhowever, consisted in the Narrator's eager, flexible voice and graphic\ngestures.\n\nI often asked her if there were no stories of elephants having done wonderful\ndeeds (as from their strength and sagacity one would have imagined them to\npossess all the qualifications requisite to heroes of romance); but, strange\nto say, she knew of none in which elephants played any part whatsoever.\n\nAs regards the Oriental names, they have generally been written as Anna\npronounced them. It was frequently not possible to give the true orthography,\nand the correctly spelt name does not always give a clue to the popular\npronunciation. So with the interpretations and geography. Where it is possible\nto identify what is described, an attempt has been made to do so; but for\nother explanations. Anna's is the sole authority: she was quite sure that\n'Seventee Bai' meant the 'Daisy Lady,' though no botanist would acknowledge\nthe plant under that name, and she was satisfied that all gentlemen who have\ntravelled know where 'Agra Brum' is, though she had never been there, and no\nsuch province appears in any ordinary Gazetteer or description of the city of\nAkbar.\n\nThese few legends, told by one old woman to her grandchildren, can only be\nconsidered as representatives of a class. 'That world,' to use her own words,\n'is gone'; and those who can tell us about it in this critical and\nunimaginative age are fast disappearing too, before the onward march of\ncivilisation; yet there must be in the country many a rich gold-mine\nunexplored. Will no one go to the diggings?\n\nM.
