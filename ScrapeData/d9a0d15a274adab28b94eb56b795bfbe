[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n4:5:10\n\n### TENTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A 3.\n\n4:5:10:11\\. If the Soma is carried off, let him say, 'Run about and seek!' If\nthey find it, why should they care? But if they do not find it, atonement is\nmade therefore.\n\n4:5:10:22\\. Now there are two kinds of Phalguna plants,\n\np. 422\n\nthe red-flowering and the brown-flowering. Those Phalguna plants which have\nbrown flowers one may press; for they, the brown-flowering Phalgunas, are akin\nto the Soma-plant: therefore he may press those with brown flowers.\n\n4:5:10:33\\. If they cannot get brown-flowering (Phalgunas), he may press the\nSyenah _ri_ ta 1 plant. For when Gayatri flew up for Soma, a sprig of Soma\nfell from her, as she was bringing him: it became the Syenah _ri_ ta plant:\ntherefore he may press the Syenah _ri_ ta plant.\n\n4:5:10:44\\. If they cannot get the _S_ yenah _ri_ ta, he may press \xc3\x82dara\nplants. For when the head of the sacrifice was cut off, then \xc3\x82dara plants\nsprung from the sap which spirted from it: therefore he may press \xc3\x82dara\nplants.\n\n4:5:10:55\\. If they cannot get \xc3\x82daras, he may press brown Dub (durva) plants,\nfor they, the brown Dub plants, are akin to the Soma: therefore he may press\nbrown Dub plants.\n\n4:5:10:66\\. If they cannot get brown Dub plants, he may also press any kind of\nyellow Ku _s_ a plants. In that case let him also give one cow; and, when he\ncomes out of the purificatory bath, let him again become consecrated, for the\natonement for that (use of plants other than Soma) is a second sacrifice. So\nmuch then as to those robbed of their Soma.\n\n4:5:10:77\\. Now as to those who burst their Soma-trough (kala _s_ a). If the\ntrough bursts, let him say, 'Try to catch it!' If they catch a handful or a\ngoupenful 2 (of Soma), let them perform, as far as is in their power 3,\n\np. 423\n\nafter pouring (water) to it from other ekadhana pitchers. But if they do not\ncatch any, let them perform, as far as is in their power, after pouring out\nsome of the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a and pouring (water) thereto from other ekadhana\npitchers. And if the trough bursts before the dakshi _n_ a (cows) have been\nled up, let him then give one cow; and after coming out from the purificatory\nbath, let him be consecrated again; for the atonement for that (mishap) is a\nsecond sacrifice. So much then as to those who burst the trough.\n\n4:5:10:88\\. Then as to those by whom any Soma is left over. If any (Soma) be\nleft after the Agnish _t_ oma, let him draw the Ukthya cup from the Putabh\n_ri_ t. If any be left after the Ukthya, let him undertake the Sho _d_ a _s_\nin. If any be left after the Sho _d_ a _s_ in, let them undertake a night\n(performance) 1. If any be left after the night (performance), let them\nundertake a day (performance) 2. But nothing, surely, remains after that 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[421:3](sbe2669.htm#fr_982) In the Ka _n_ va text I have met with nothing\ncorresponding to this Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[422:1](sbe2669.htm#fr_983) That is, the plant 'carried away by the falcon (or\neagle).'\n\n[422:2](sbe2669.htm#fr_984) Scotch for the measure of both hands placed side\nby side; Ags. geap, Low Germ. gopse.\n\n[422:3](sbe2669.htm#fr_985) Yathaprabhavam: Katy. XXV, 12, 24 seems to take it\nin the p. 432 sense of 'abundantly,' as he circumscribes it by 'prabhavayanta\n_h_ ' (which the commentator explains by 'distributing over the several\nvessels').\n\n[423:1](sbe2669.htm#fr_986) That is, he is to perform an Atiratra, see [p.\n397](sbe2661.htm#page_397), note [2](sbe2662.htm#fn_928).\n\n[423:2](sbe2669.htm#fr_987) Katy. XXV, 13, 52-14, in that emergency,\nprescribes either the B _ri_ hat-saman (by which a seventeenth stotra is\nobtained at the Va _g_ apeya sacrifice, for which see more in Ka _n_ _d_ a V),\nor the Mahavrata (see [IV, 6, 4, 1](sbe2673.htm#4:6:4:1), with note\n[2](sbe2673.htm#fn_995)), or the Aptoryama (see [p.\n398](sbe2662.htm#page_398), note [2](sbe2662.htm#fn_928)).\n\n[423:3](sbe2669.htm#fr_988) The meaning of this seems to be, that after the\nAptoryama, no other sacrifice remains at which he could dispose of any Soma\nthat might be left (and hence one must finish it at that sacrifice). According\nto Katy. ib. 15, he is to repeat the Aptoryama, if any Soma remains after the\nfirst performance.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 6, 1. Sixth Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe2670.htm)\n\n"
