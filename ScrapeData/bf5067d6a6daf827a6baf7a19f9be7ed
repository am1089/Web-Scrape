And in the case of space also (the doctrine of its being a non-entity is\nuntenable) on account of its not differing (from the two other kinds of non-\nentity).\n\nWe have shown so far that of the triad declared by the Bauddhas to be devoid\nof all positive characteristics, and therefore non-definable, two (viz. prati-\nsa _m_ khyavirodha and aprati\xc2\xb0) cannot be shown to be such; we now proceed to\nshow the same with regard to space (ether, aka _s_ a).\n\nWith regard to space also it cannot be maintained that it is non-definable,\nsince substantiality can be established in the case of space no less than in\nthe case of the two so-called non-entities treated of in the preceding Sutras.\nThat space is a real thing follows in the first place from certain scriptural\npassages, such as 'space sprang from the Self.'--To those, again, who (like\nthe Bauddhas) disagree with us as to the authoritativeness of Scripture we\npoint out that the real existence of space is to be inferred from the quality\nof sound, since we observe that earth and other real things are the abodes of\nsmell and the other qualities.--Moreover, if you declare that space is nothing\nbut the absence in general of any covering (occupying) body, it would follow\nthat while one bird is flying--whereby space is occupied--there would be no\nroom for a second bird wanting to fly at the same time. And if you should\nreply that the second bird may fly there where there is absence of a covering\nbody, we point out that that something by which the absence of covering bodies\nis distinguished must be a positive entity, viz. space in our sense, and not\nthe mere non-existence of covering bodies  1.--Moreover, the Bauddha places\nhimself, by his view of space, in opposition to other parts of his system. For\nwe find, in the Bauddha Scriptures, a series of questions and answers\n(beginning, 'On what, O reverend Sir, is the earth founded?'), in which the\nfollowing\n\np. 413\n\nquestion occurs, 'On what is the air founded?' to which it is replied that the\nair is founded on space (ether). Now it is clear that this statement is\nappropriate only on the supposition of space being a positive entity, not a\nmere negation.--Further, there is a self-contradiction in the Bauddha\nstatements regarding all the three kinds of negative entities, it being said,\non the one hand, that they are not positively definable, and, on the other\nhand, that they are eternal. Of what is not real neither eternity nor non-\neternity can be predicated, since the distinction of subjects and predicates\nof attribution is founded entirely on real things. Anything with regard to\nwhich that distinction holds good we conclude to be a real thing, such as jars\nand the like are, not a mere undefinable negation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[412:1](sbe34200.htm#fr_406) What does enable us to declare that there is\navara _n_ abhava in one place and not in another?
