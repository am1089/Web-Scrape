IV.\n\nNarayan\xcc\x81a\'s appearance, in the beginning of the Kalpa, as the Varsha or boar:\nPrithivi (Earth) addresses him: he raises the world from beneath the waters:\nhymned by Sanandana and the Yogis. The earth floats on the ocean: divided into\nseven zones. The lower spheres of the universe restored. Creation renewed.\n\nMAITREYA.--Tell me, mighty sage, how, in the commencement of the (present)\nKalpa, Narayan\xcc\x81a, who is named Brahma, created all existent things 1.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--In what manner the divine Brahma, who is one with Narayan\xcc\x81a,\ncreated progeny, and is thence named the lord of progeny (Prajapati), the lord\ngod, you shall hear.\n\nAt the close of the past (or Padma) Kalpa, the divine Brahma, endowed with the\nquality of goodness, awoke from his night of sleep, and beheld the universe\nvoid. He, the supreme Narayan\xcc\x81a, the incomprehensible, the sovereign of all\ncreatures, invested with the form of Brahma, the god without beginning, the\ncreator of all things; of whom, with respect to his name Narayan\xcc\x81a, the god\nwho has the form of Brahma, the imperishable origin of the world, this verse\nis repeated, "The waters are called Nara, because they were the offspring of\nNara (the supreme spirit); and as in them his first (Ayana) progress (in the\ncharacter of Brahma) took place, he is thence named Narayan\xcc\x81a (he whose place\nof moving was the waters) 2." He, the lord, concluding that within the waters\nlay the\n\np. 28\n\nearth, and being desirous to raise it up, created another form for that\npurpose; and as in preceding Kalpas he had assumed the shape of a fish or a\ntortoise, so in this he took the figure of a boar. Having adopted a form\ncomposed of the sacrifices of the Vedas 3, for the preservation of the whole\nearth, the eternal, supreme, and universal soul, the great progenitor of\ncreated beings, eulogized by Sanaka and the other\n\np. 29\n\nsaints who dwell in the sphere of holy men (Janaloka); he, the supporter of\nspiritual and material being, plunged into the ocean. The goddess Earth,\nbeholding him thus descending to the subterrene regions, bowed in devout\nadoration, and thus glorified the god:--\n\n_Pr ithivi_ (Earth).--Hail to thee, who art all creatures; to thee, the holder\nof the mace and shell: elevate me now from this place, as thou hast upraised\nme in days of old. From thee have I proceeded; of thee do I consist; as do the\nskies, and all other existing things. Hail to thee, spirit of the supreme\nspirit; to thee, soul of soul; to thee, who art discrete and indiscrete\nmatter; who art one with the elements and with time. Thou art the creator of\nall things, their preserver, and their destroyer, in the forms, oh lord, of\nBrahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u, and Rudra, at the seasons of creation, duration, and\ndissolution. When thou hast devoured all things, thou reposest on the ocean\nthat sweeps over the world, meditated upon, oh Govinda, by the wise. No one\nknoweth thy true nature, and the gods adore thee only in the forms it bath\npleased thee to assume. They who are desirous of final liberation, worship\nthee as the supreme Brahma; and who that adores not Vasudeva, shall obtain\nemancipation? Whatever may be apprehended by the mind, whatever may be\nperceived by the senses, whatever may he discerned by the intellect, all is\nbut a form of thee. I am of thee, upheld by thee; thou art my creator, and to\nthee I fly for refuge: hence, in this universe, Madhavi (the bride of Madhava\nor Vishn\xcc\x81u) is my designation. Triumph to the essence of all wisdom, to the\nunchangeable, the imperishable: triumph to the eternal; to the indiscrete, to\nthe essence of discrete things: to him who is both cause and effect; who is\nthe universe; the sinless lord of sacrifice 4; triumph. Thou art sacrifice;\nthou art the oblation; thou art the mystic Omkara; thou art the sacrificial\nfires; thou art the Vedas, and their dependent sciences; thou art, Hari, the\nobject of all worship 5. The sun, the stars, the planets, the whole world; all\nthat is formless, or that has form; all that is visible, or invisible; all,\nPurushottama, that I have said,\n\np. 30\n\nor left unsaid; all this, Supreme, thou art. Hail to thee, again and again!\nhail! all hail!\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The auspicious supporter of the world, being thus hymned by the\nearth, emitted a low murmuring sound, like the chanting of the Sama veda; and\nthe mighty boar, whose eyes were like the lotus, and whose body, vast as the\nNila mountain, was of the dark colour of the lotus leaves 6, uplifted upon his\nample tusks the earth from the lowest regions. As he reared up his head, the\nwaters shed from his brow purified the great sages, Sanandana and others,\nresiding in the sphere of the saints. Through the indentations made by his\nhoofs, the waters rushed into the lower worlds with a thundering noise. Before\nhis breath, the pious denizens of Janaloka were scattered, and the Munis\nsought for shelter amongst the bristles upon the scriptural body of the boar,\ntrembling\n\np. 31\n\nas he rose up, supporting the earth, and dripping with moisture. Then the\ngreat sages, Sanandana and the rest, residing continually in the sphere of\nsaints, were inspired with delight, and bowing lowly they praised the stern-\neyed upholder of the earth.\n\n_The Yogis_.--Triumph, lord of lords supreme; Ke\xc5\x9bava, sovereign of the earth,\nthe wielder of the mace, the shell, the discus, and the sword: cause of\nproduction, destruction, and existence. THOU ART, oh god: there is no other\nsupreme condition, but thou. Thou, lord, art the person of sacrifice: for thy\nfeet are the Vedas; thy tusks are the stake to which the victim is bound; in\nthy teeth are the offerings; thy mouth is the altar; thy tongue is the fire;\nand the hairs of thy body are the sacrificial grass. Thine eyes, oh\nomnipotent, are day and night; thy head is the seat of all, the place of\nBrahma; thy mane is all the hymns of the Vedas; thy nostrils are all\noblations: oh thou, whose snout is the ladle of oblation; whose deep voice is\nthe chanting of the Sama veda; whose body is the hall of sacrifice; whose\njoints are the different ceremonies; and whose ears have the properties of\nboth voluntary and obligatory rites 7: do thou, who art eternal, who art in\nsize a mountain, be propitious. We acknowledge thee, who hast traversed the\nworld, oh universal form, to be the beginning, the continuance, and the\ndestruction of all things: thou art the supreme god. Have pity on us, oh lord\nof conscious and unconscious beings. The orb of the earth is seen seated on\nthe tip of thy tusks, as if thou hadst been sporting amidst a lake where the\nlotus floats, and hadst borne away the leaves covered with soil. The space\nbetween heaven and earth is occupied by thy body, oh thou of unequalled glory,\nresplendent with the power of pervading the universe, oh lord, for the benefit\nof all. Thou art the aim of all: there is none other than thee, sovereign of\nthe world: this is thy might, by which all things, fixed or movable, are\npervaded. This form, which is now beheld, is thy form, as one essentially with\nwisdom. Those who have not practised devotion, conceive erroneously of the\nnature of the world. The ignorant,\n\np. 32\n\nwho do not perceive that this universe is of the nature of wisdom, and judge\nof it as an object of perception only, are lost in the ocean of spiritual\nignorance. But they who know true wisdom, and whose minds are pure, behold\nthis whole world as one with divine knowledge, as one with thee, oh god. Be\nfavourable, oh universal spirit: raise up this earth, for the habitation of\ncreated beings. Inscrutable deity, whose eyes are like lotuses, give us\nfelicity. Oh lord, thou art endowed with the quality of goodness: raise up,\nGovinda, this earth, for the general good. Grant us happiness, oh lotus-eyed.\nMay this, thy activity in creation, be beneficial to the earth. Salutation to\nthee. Grant us happiness, oh lotus-eyed.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The supreme being thus eulogized, upholding the earth, raised it\nquickly, and placed it on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a\nmighty vessel, and from its expansive surface does not sink beneath the\nwaters. Then, having levelled the earth, the great eternal deity divided it\ninto portions, by mountains: he who never wills in vain, created, by his\nirresistible power, those mountains again upon the earth which had been\nconsumed at the destruction of the world. Having then divided the earth into\nseven great portions or continents, as it was before, he constructed in like\nmanner the four (lower) spheres, earth, sky, heaven, and the sphere of the\nsages (Maharloka). Thus Hari, the four-faced god, invested with the quality of\nactivity, and taking the form of Brahma, accomplished the creation: but he\n(Brahma) is only the instrumental cause of things to be created; the things\nthat are capable of being created arise from nature as a common material\ncause: with exception of one instrumental cause alone, there is no need of any\nother cause, for (imperceptible) substance becomes perceptible substance\naccording to the powers with which it is originally imbued 8.\n\np. 33\n\nThis page consists solely of footnotes\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[27:1](vp038.htm#fr_159) This creation is of the secondary order, or\nPratiserga; water, and even the earth, being in existence, and consequently\nhaving been preceded by the creation of Mahat and the elements. It is also a\ndifferent Pratiserga from that described by Manu, in which Swayambhu first\ncreates the waters, then the egg: one of the simplest forms, and perhaps\ntherefore one of the earliest in which the tradition occurs.\n\n[27:2](vp038.htm#fr_160) This is the well known verse of Menu, I. 8, rendered\nby Sir Wm. Jones, "The waters are called Nara, because they were the\nproduction of Nara, or \'the spirit\' of God; and since they were his first\nAyana, or place of motion, he thence is named Narayan\xcc\x81a, or \'moving on the\nwaters.\'" Now although there can be little doubt that this tradition is in\nsubstance the same as that of Genesis, the language of the translation is\nperhaps more scriptural than p. 28 is quite warranted. The waters, it is said\nin the text of Manu, were the progeny of Nara, which Kulluka Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a explains\nParamatma, the supreme soul; that is, they were the first productions of God\nin creation. Ayana, instead of \'place of motion,\' is explained by \xc3\x81sraya,\nplace of abiding.\' Narayan\xcc\x81a means, therefore, he whose place of abiding was\nthe deep. The verse occurs in several of the Puran\xcc\x81as, in general in nearly\nthe same words, and almost always as a quotation, as in our text The Linga,\nVayu, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81as, citing the same, have a somewhat different\nreading; or, \'\xc3\x81pa (is the same as) Nara, or bodies (Tanava); such, we have\nheard (from the Vedas), is the meaning of Apa. He who sleeps in them, is\nthence called Narayan\xcc\x81a.\' The ordinary sense of Tanu is either \'minute\' or\n\'body,\' nor does it occur amongst the synonymes of water in the Nirukta of the\nVedas. It may perhaps be intended to say, that Nara or Apa has the meaning of\n\'bodily forms,\' in which spirit is enshrined, and of which the waters, with\nVishn\xcc\x81u resting upon them, are a type; for there is much mysticism in the\nPuran\xcc\x81as in which the passage thus occurs. Even in them, however, it is\nintroduced in the usual manner, by describing the world as water alone, and\nVishn\xcc\x81u reposing upon the deep: ### Vayu P. The Bhagavata has evidently\nattempted to explain the ancient text: \'When the embodied god in the beginning\ndivided the mundane egg, and issued forth, then, requiring an abiding-place,\nhe created the waters: the pure created the pure. In them, his own created, he\nabode for a thousand years, and thence received the name of Narayan\xcc\x81a: the\nwaters being the product of the embodied deity:\' i. e. they were the product\nof Nara or Vishn\xcc\x81u, as the first male or Virat, and were therefore termed\nNara: and from there being his Ayana or Sthana, his \'abiding place,\' comes his\nepithet of Narayan\xcc\x81a.\n\n[28:3](vp038.htm#fr_161) The Varaha form was chosen, says the Vayu P., because\nit is an animal delighting to sport in water, but it is described in many\nPuran\xcc\x81as, as it is in the Vishn\xcc\x81u, as a type of the ritual of the Vedas, as we\nshall have further occasion to remark. The elevation of the earth from beneath\nthe ocean in this form, was, therefore, probably at first an allegorical\nrepresentation of the extrication of the world from a deluge of iniquity by\nthe rites of religion. Geologists may perhaps suspect, in the original and\nunmystified tradition, an allusion to a geological fact, or the existence of\nlacustrine mammalia in the early periods of the earth.\n\n[29:4](vp038.htm#fr_162) Yajnapati, \'the bestower of the beneficial results of\nsacrifices.\'\n\n[29:5](vp038.htm#fr_163) Yajnapurusha, \'the male or soul of sacrifice;\'\nexplained by Yajnamurtti, \'the form or personification of sacrifice;\' or\nYajnaradhya \'he who is to be propitiated by it.\'\n\n[30:6](vp038.htm#fr_164) Varaha Avatara. The description of the figure of the\nboar is much more particularly detailed in other Puran\xcc\x81as. As in the Vayu:\n"The boar was ten Yojanas in breadth, a thousand Yojanas high; of the colour\nof a dark cloud; and his roar was like thunder; his bulk was vast as a\nmountain; his tusks were white, sharp, and fearful; fire flashed from his eyes\nlike lightning, and he was radiant as the sun; his shoulders were round, flit,\nand large; he strode along like a powerful lion; his haunches were fat, his\nloins were slender, and his body was smooth and beautiful." The Matsya P.\ndescribes the Varaha in the same words, with one or two unimportant varieties.\nThe Bhagavata indulges in that amplification which marks its more recent\ncomposition, and describes the Varaha as issuing from the nostrils of Brahma,\nat first of the size of the thumb, or an inch long, and presently increasing\nto the stature of an elephant. That work also subjoins a legend of the death\nof the demon Hiranyaksha, who in a preceding existence was one of Vishn\xcc\x81u\'s\ndoorkeepers, at his palace in Vaikuntha. Having refused admission to a party\nof Munis, they cursed him, and he was in consequence born as one of the sons\nof Diti. When the earth, oppressed by the weight of the mountains, sunk down\ninto the waters, Vishn\xcc\x81u was beheld in the subterrene regions, or Rasatala, by\nHiranyaksha in the act of carrying it off. The demon claimed the earth, and\ndefied Vishn\xcc\x81u to combat; and a conflict took place, in which Hiranyaksha was\nslain. This legend has not been met with in any other Puran\xcc\x81a, and certainly\ndoes not occur in the chief of them, any more than in our text. In the Moksha\nDherma of the Mahabharata, e.35, Vishn\xcc\x81u destroys the demons in the form of\nthe Varaha, but no particular individual is specified, nor does the elevation\nof the earth depend upon their discomfiture. The Kalika Upapuran\xcc\x81a has an\nabsurd legend of a conflict between \xc5\x9aiva as a Sarabha, a fabulous animal, and\nVishn\xcc\x81u as the Varaha, in which the latter suffers himself and his offspring\nbegotten upon earth to be slain.\n\n[31:7](vp038.htm#fr_165) This, which is nothing more than the developement of\nthe notion that the Varaha incarnation typifies the ritual of the Vedas, is\nrepeated in most of the Puran\xcc\x81as in the same or nearly the same words.\n\n[32:8](vp038.htm#fr_166) This seems equivalent to the ancient notion of a\nplastic nature: "All parts of matter, by reason of a certain life in them,\nbeing supposed able to form themselves artificially and methodically to the\ngreatest advantage of their present respective capabilities." This, which\nCudworth (c. III.) calls hylozoism, is not incompatible with an active\ncreator: "not that he should, \xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xcf\x85\xcf\x81\xce\xb3\xce\xb5\xe1\xbf\x96\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x85\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xb1, set his own hand to every\nwork, which, as Aristotle says, would be, \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xce\xb5\xcf\x80\xe1\xbd\xb2\xcf\x82 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbf\xb7 \xce\xb8\xce\xb5\xe1\xbf\xb7, unbecoming God; but,\nas in the case of Brahma and other subordinate agents, that they should\noccasion p. 33 the various developments of crude nature to take place, by\nsupplying that will, of which nature itself is incapable. Action being once\ninstituted by an instrumental medium, or by the will of an intellectual agent,\nit is continued by powers or a vitality inherent in nature or the matter of\ncreation itself. The efficiency of such subordinate causes was advocated by\nPlato, Aristotle, and others; and the opinion of Zeno, as stated by Laertius,\nmight be taken for a translation of some such passage as that in our text:\n\xe1\xbc\x9c\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xb9 \xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb2 \xcf\x86\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x83\xce\xb9\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\x95\xce\xbe\xce\xb9\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbe \xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xe1\xbf\x86\xcf\x82 \xce\xba\xce\xb9\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xcf\x85\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xbd\xce\xb7 \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb0 \xcf\x83\xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xce\xbc\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\xba\xcf\x82 \xce\xbb\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xcf\x85\xcf\x82, \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6\xcf\x83\xce\xac \xcf\x84\xce\xb5\n\xce\xba\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xcf\x83\xcf\x85\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb3\xcf\x87\xce\xbf\xcf\x85\xcf\x83\xce\xb1 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb0 \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbe \xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xe1\xbf\x86\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbd \xe1\xbd\xa1\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xcf\x83\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xcf\x82 \xcf\x87\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xcf\x82, \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xce\xb1\xe1\xbf\xa6\xcf\x84\xce\xb1 \xce\xb4\xcf\x81\xe1\xbf\xb6\xcf\x83\xce\xb1 \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x86\xe1\xbe\xbd \xce\xbf\xe1\xbc\xb5\xcf\x89\xce\xbd\n\xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xce\xba\xcf\x81\xce\xaf\xce\xb8\xce\xb7\xce\x87 \'Nature is a habit moved from itself, according to seminal\nprinciples; perfecting and containing those several things which in\ndeterminate times are produced from it, and acting agreeably to that from\nwhich it was secreted.\' Intell.
