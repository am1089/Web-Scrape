Hereby air (also) is explained.\n\nThe present Sutra extends the reasoning concerning ether to the air of which\nthe ether is the abode. The different views about air also are to be arranged\nin an analogous manner. The purvapakshin maintains that the air is not a\nproduct, because it is not mentioned in that chapter of the _Kh_ andogya which\ntreats of the origination of things. The opposite opinion is, that the air is\nmentioned in the parallel chapter of the Taittiriyaka ('from the ether sprang\nthe air'). The two scriptural passages being of a conflicting nature, the\npurvapakshin maintains that the passage which declares the air to have\noriginated must be taken in a secondary sense; firstly on account of the\nimpossibility (of the literal sense being adopted), as shown (in the adhikara\n_n_ a treating of the ether); secondly on account of that passage which denies\nthat it ever sets, 'Vayu (the air) is the deity that never sets' (B _ri_. Up.\nI, 5, 22); and thirdly on account of those passages which declare it to be\nimmortal. The final opinion on the other hand is, that air is a product; in\nthe first place because this conclusion is conformable to the general tendency\nof scripture; and, in the second place, because it is generally admitted that\nwhatever\n\np. 19\n\nis divided is an effect. The denial of its ever setting refers to the lower\nknowledge (apara vidya 1) and is merely a relative one, Vayu not setting in\nthe same way as fire, &c. The statement as to the immortality, &c. of air has\nalready received its reply (in the adhikara _n_ a treating of the ether). Here\nit maybe asked why, ether and air being equally mentioned and not mentioned in\nthe chapters treating of the origin of the world, one adhikara _n_ a is not\nconsidered to suffice for both, and why instead of that there is made a formal\nextension of the former reasoning to the latter case, although there is no\ndifference between the two cases. To this we reply that there is indeed some\nreason for the question; that, however, the formal extension is made for the\npurpose of removing any doubts which might possibly be engendered in the minds\nof slow-witted people by mere words 2. For as, in the Sa _m_ vargavidya and\nother passages, the glory of Vayu is referred to as an object of worship; and\nas scripture says that he never sets, &c., some men might think that he is\neternal.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[19:1](sbe38009.htm#fr_15) In which Brahman is spoken of as to be meditated\nupon under the form of Vayu.\n\n[19:2](sbe38009.htm#fr_16) _S_ abdanurodhiny eva _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ka na\nvastvanurodhiniti. \xc3\x82n.
