Now the Veda declares also one's offspring to be immortality (in this\nverse): 'In thy offspring thou art born again, that, mortal, is thy\nimmortality.'\n\n2\\. Now it can also be perceived by the senses that the (father) has been\nreproduced separately (in the son); for the likeness (of a father and of a\nson) is even visible, only (their) bodies are different.\n\n3\\. 'These (sons) who live, fulfilling the rites taught (in the Veda),\nincrease the fame and heavenly bliss of their departed ancestors.'\n\n4\\. 'In this manner each succeeding (generation increases the fame and\nheavenly bliss) of the preceding ones.'\n\np. 160\n\n5\\. 'They (the ancestors) live in heaven until the (next) general destruction\nof created things.'\n\n6\\. At the new creation (of, the world) they become the seed. That has been\ndeclared in the Bhavishyatpura _n_ a. 6\n\n7\\. Now Pra _g_ apati also says,\n\n8\\. 'Those dwell with us who fulfil the following (duties): the study of the\nthree Vedas, the studentship, the procreation of children, faith, religious\nausterities, sacrifices, and the giving of gifts. He who praises other\n(duties), becomes dust and perishes.' 8\n\n9\\. Those among these (sons) who commit sin, perish alone, just as the leaf of\na tree (which has been attacked by worms falls without injuring its branch or\ntree). They do not hurt their ancestors.\n\n10\\. (For) the (ancestor) has no connection with the acts committed (by his\ndescendant) in this world, nor with their results in the next.\n\n11\\. (The truth of) that may be known by the following (reason):\n\n12\\. This creation (is the work) of Pra _g_ apati and of the sages.\n\n13\\. The bodies of those (sages) who stay there (in heaven) on account of\ntheir merits appear visibly most excellent and brilliant (as, for instance,\nthe constellation of the seven _Ri_ shis). 13\n\n14\\. But even though some (ascetic), whilst still 14\n\np. 161\n\nin the body, may gain heaven through a portion of (the merit acquired by his\nformer) works or through austerities, and though he may. accomplish (his\nobjects) by his mere wish, still this is no reason to place one order before\nthe other.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[160:6](sbe0259.htm#fr_747) **24**.
