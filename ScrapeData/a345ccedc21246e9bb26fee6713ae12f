Some wise men, deluded, speak of Nature, and others of Time (as the cause\nof everything 2); but it is the greatness of God by which this Brahma-wheel is\nmade to turn.\n\n2\\. It is at the command of him who always covers this world, the knower, the\ntime of time 3, who assumes qualities and all knowledge 4, it is at his\ncommand that this work (creation) unfolds itself, which is called earth,\nwater, fire, air, and ether;\n\n3 5. He who, after he has done that work and rested again, and after he has\nbrought together one essence (the self) with the other (matter), with one,\ntwo, three, or eight, with time also and with the subtile qualities of the\nmind,\n\n4\\. Who, after starting 6 the works endowed with (the three) qualities, can\norder all things, yet when, in the absence of all these, he has caused the\ndestruction of the work, goes on, being in truth 7 different (from all he has\nproduced);\n\np. 261\n\n5\\. He is the beginning, producing the causes which unite (the soul with the\nbody), and, being\n\np. 262\n\nabove the three kinds of time (past, present, future), he is seen as without\nparts 1, after we have first worshipped that adorable god, who has many forms,\nand who is the true source (of all things), as dwelling in our own mind.\n\n6\\. He is beyond all the forms of the tree 2 (of the world) and of time, he is\nthe other, from whom this world moves round, when 3 one has known him who\n\np. 263\n\nbrings good and removes evil, the lord of bliss, as dwelling within the self,\nthe immortal, the support of all.\n\n7\\. Let us know that highest great lord of lords 1, the highest deity of\ndeities, the master of masters, the highest above, as god, the lord of the\nworld, the adorable.\n\n8\\. There is no effect and no cause known of him, no one is seen like unto him\nor better; his high power is revealed as manifold, as inherent, acting as\nforce and knowledge.\n\n9\\. There is no master of his in the world, no ruler of his, not even a sign\nof him 2. He is the cause, the lord of the lords of the organs 3, and there is\nof him neither parent nor lord.\n\n10\\. That only god who spontaneously covered himself, like a spider, with\nthreads drawn from the first cause (pradhana), grant us entrance into Brahman\n4.\n\n11\\. He is the one God, hidden in all beings, all-pervading,\n\np. 264\n\nthe self within all beings, watching over all works, dwelling in all beings,\nthe witness, the perceiver 1, the only one, free from qualities.\n\n12 2. He is the one ruler of many who (seem to act, but really do) not act 3;\nhe makes the one seed manifold. The wise who perceive him within their self,\nto them belongs eternal happiness, not to others.\n\n13 4. He is the eternal among eternals, the thinker among thinkers, who,\nthough one, fulfils the desires of many. He who has known that cause which is\nto be apprehended by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khya (philosophy) and Yoga (religious discipline),\nhe is freed from all fetters.\n\np. 265\n\n14\\. The 1 sun does not shine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor these\nlightnings, and much less this fire. When he shines, everything shines after\nhim; by his light all this is lightened.\n\n15\\. He is the one bird 2 in the midst of the world; he is also (like) the\nfire (of the sun) that has set in the ocean. A man who knows him truly, passes\nover death 3; there is no other path to go.\n\n16\\. He makes all, he knows all, the self-caused, the knower 4, the time of\ntime (destroyer of time), who assumes qualities and knows everything, the\nmaster of nature and of man 5, the lord of the three qualities (gu _n_ a), the\ncause of the bondage, the existence, and the liberation of the world 6.\n\n17\\. He who has become that 7, he is the immortal, remaining the lord, the\nknower, the ever-present guardian of this world, who rules this world for\never, for no one else is able to rule it.\n\n18\\. Seeking for freedom I go for refuge to that God who is the light of his\nown thoughts 8, he who\n\np. 266\n\nfirst creates Brahman (m.) 1 and delivers the Vedas to him;\n\n19\\. Who is without parts, without actions, tranquil, without fault, without\ntaint 2, the highest bridge to immortality--like a fire that has consumed its\nfuel.\n\n20\\. Only when men shall roll up the sky like a hide, will there be an end of\nmisery, unless God has first been known 3.\n\n21\\. Through the power of his penance and through the grace of God 4 has the\nwise _S_ veta _s_ vatara truly 5 proclaimed Brahman, the highest and holiest,\nto the best of ascetics 6, as approved by the company of _Ri_ shis.\n\np. 267\n\n22\\. This highest mystery in the Vedanta, delivered in a former age, should\nnot be given to one whose passions have not been subdued, nor to one who is\nnot a son, or who is not a pupil 1.\n\n23\\. If these truths have been told to a high-minded man, who feels the\nhighest devotion for God, and for his Guru as for God, then they will shine\nforth,--then they will shine forth indeed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[260:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_834) See Muir, Metrical Translations, p. 198.\n\n[260:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_835) See before, 1, 2.\n\n[260:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_836) The destroyer of time. Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman reads\nkalakalo, and explains it by kalasya niyanta, upaharta. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda\nexplains kala _h_ sarvavina _s_ akari, tasyapi vinasakara _h_. See also verse\n16.\n\n[260:4](sbe15105.htm#fr_837) Or sarvavid ya _h_.\n\n[260:5](sbe15105.htm#fr_838) Instead of vinivartya, Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman and _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85karananda read viniv _ri_ tya.\n\n[260:6](sbe15105.htm#fr_839) \xc3\x82ruhya for arabhya, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda.\n\n[260:7](sbe15105.htm#fr_840) These two verses are again extremely obscure, and\nthe explanations of the commentators throw little light on their real,\noriginal meaning. To begin with _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, he assumes the subject to be the\nsame as he at whose command this work unfolds itself, and explains p. 261\ntattvasya tattvena sametya yogam by atmano bhumyadina yoga _m_ sa _m_ gamayya.\nAs the eight Tattvas he gives earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, thought,\npersonality, while the \xc3\x82tmagu _n_ as are, according to him, the affections of\nthe mind, love, anger, &c. In the second verse, however, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara seems to\nassume a different subject. 'If a man,' he says, 'having done works, infected\nby qualities, should transfer them on \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, the Lord, there would be\ndestruction of the works formerly done by him, because there would be no more\nconnection with the self.' Something is left out, but that this is _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara's idea, appears from the verses which he quotes in support, and which\nare intended to show that Yogins, transferring all their acts, good, bad, or\nindifferent, on Brahman, are no longer affected by them. 'That person,' _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara, continues, 'his works being destroyed and his nature purified, moves\non, different from all things (tattva), from all the results of ignorance,\nknowing himself to be Brahman.' 'Or,' he adds, 'if we read anyad, it means, he\ngoes to that Brahman which is different from all things.'\n\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda takes a different view. He says: 'If a man has performed\nsacrifices, and has finished them, or, has turned away from them again as\nvain, and if he has obtained union with that which is the real of the\n(apparently) real, &c.' The commentator then asks what is that with which he\nobtains union, and replies, 'the one, i.e. ignorance; the two, i.e. right and\nwrong; the three, i.e. the three colours, red, white, and black; and the\neight, i.e. the five elements, with mind, thought, and personality; also with\ntime, and with the subtile affections of the mind.' He then goes on, 'If that\nman, after having begun qualified works, should take on himself all states\n(resulting from ignorance), yet, when these states cease, there would be an\nend of the work, good or bad, done by him, and when his work has come to an\nend, he abides in truth (according to the Veda); while the other, who differs\nfrom the Veda, is wrong.' _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda, however, evidently feels that this\nis a doubtful interpretation, and he suggests another, viz. 'If the Lord\nhimself,' he says, 'determined these states (bhava), it would seem that there\nwould be no end of sa _m_ sara. He therefore says, that when these states,\nignorance &c., cease, the work done by man ceases; and when the work done\nceases, the living soul gets free of sa _m_ sara, being in truth another, i.e.\ndifferent from ignorance and its products.'\n\nVi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman says: 'If a man, having done work, turns away p. 262 from\nit, and obtains union of one tattva (the tvam, or self) with the real tattva\n(the tat, or the Lord);--and how? By means of the one, i.e. the teaching of\nthe Guru; the two, i.e. love of the Guru and of the Lord; the three, i.e.\nhearing, remembering, and meditating; the eight, i.e. restraint, penance,\npostures, regulation of the breath, abstraction, devotion, contemplation, and\nmeditation (Yoga-sutras II, 2 9); by time, i.e. the right time for work; by\nthe qualities of the self, i.e. pity, &c.; by the subtile ones, i.e. the good\ndispositions for knowledge, then (we must supply) he becomes free.' And this\nhe explains more fully in the next verse. 'If, after having done qualified\nworks, i.e. works to please the Lord, a Yati discards all things, and\nrecognises the phenomenal character of all states, and traces them back to\ntheir real source in Mulaprak _ri_ ti and, in the end, in the Sa _k_ _k_\nidananda, he becomes free. If they (the states) cease, i.e. are known in their\nreal source, the work done ceases also in its effects, and when the work has\nbeen annihilated, he goes to freedom, being another in truth; or, if we read\nanyat, he goes to what is different from all these things, namely, to the\nLord; or, he goes to a state of perfect lordship in truth, having discovered\nthe highest truth, the oneness of the self with the Highest Self.'\n\nI think that, judging from the context, the subject is really the same in both\nverses, viz. the Lord, as passing through different states, and at last\nknowing himself to be above them all. Yet, the other explanations may be\ndefended, and if the subject were taken to be different in each verse, some\ndifficulties would disappear.\n\n[262:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_841) Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman and _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda read akalo\n'pi, without parts, and _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, too, presupposes that reading, though the\ntext is corrupt in Roer's edition.\n\n[262:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_842) Explained as samsarav _ri_ ksha, the world-tree,\nas described in the Ka _th_ a Up. VI, 1.\n\n[262:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_843) It seems possible to translate this verse in\nanalogy with the former, and without supplying the verb either from yati, in\nverse 4, p. 263 or from vidama, in verse 7. The poet seems to have said, he is\nthat, he is seen as that, when one has worshipped him, or when one has known\nhim within oneself.\n\n[263:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_844) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara thinks that the lords are Vaivasvata\n&c.; the deities, Indra &c.; the masters, the Pra _g_ apatis. Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nanatman explains the lords as Brahman, Vish _n_ u, Rudra, &c.; the deities as\nIndra, &c.; the masters as Hira _n_ yagarbha, &c. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda sees in the\nlords Hira _n_ yagarbha &c., in the deities Agni &c., in the masters the Pra\n_g_ apatis, such as Ka _s_ yapa.\n\n[263:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_845) If he could be inferred from a sign, there would\nbe no necessity for the Veda to reveal him.\n\n[263:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_846) Kara _n_ a, instrument, is explained as organ of\nsense. The lords of such organs would be all living beings, and their lord the\ntrue Lord.\n\n[263:4](sbe15105.htm#fr_847) Besides brahmapyayam, i.e. brahma _n_ y apyayam,\nekibhavam, another reading is brahmavyayam, i.e. brahma _k_ avyaya _m_ _k_ a.\n\n[264:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_848) All the MSS. seem to read _k_ eta, not _k_ etta.\n\n[264:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_849) See Ka _th_ a-upanishad V, 12-15.\n\n[264:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_850) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains that the acts of living\nbeings are due to their organs, but do not affect the Highest Self, which\nalways remains passive (nishkriya).\n\n[264:4](sbe15105.htm#fr_851) I have formerly translated this verse, according\nto the reading nityo 'nityana _m_ _k_ etana _s_ _k_ etananam, the eternal\nthinker of non-eternal thoughts. This would be a true description of the\nHighest Self who, though himself eternal and passive, has to think ( _g_\nivatman) non-eternal thoughts. I took the first _k_ etana _h_ in the sense of\n_k_ etta, the second in the sense of _k_ etana _m_. The. commentators,\nhowever, take a different, and it may be, from their point, a more correct\nview. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara says: 'He is the eternal of the eternals, i.e. as he\npossesses eternity among living souls ( _g_ ivas), these living souls also may\nclaim eternity. Or the eternals may be meant for earth, water, &c. And in the\nsame way he is the thinker among thinkers.'\n\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda says: 'He is eternal, imperishable, among eternal,\nimperishable things, such as the ether, &c. He is thinking among thinkers!\n\nVi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman says: 'The Highest Lord is the cause of eternity in eternal\nthings on earth, and the cause of thought in the thinkers on earth.' But he\nallows another construction, namely, that he is the eternal thinker of those\nwho on earth are endowed with eternity and thought. In the end all these\ninterpretations come to p. 265 the same, viz. that there is only one eternal,\nand only one thinker, from whom all that is (or seems to be) eternal and all\nthat is thought on earth is derived.\n\n[265:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_852) See Ka _th_. Up. V, 15; Mu _n_ _d_. Up. II, 2,\n10; Bhagavadgita XV, 6.\n\n[265:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_853) Ha _m_ sa, frequently used for the Highest Self,\nis explained here as hanty avidyadibandhakara _n_ am iti ha _m_ sa _h_.\n\n[265:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_854) Cf. III, 8.\n\n[265:4](sbe15105.htm#fr_855) Again the MSS. read kalakalo, as in verse 2. They\nalso agree in putting _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ah before kalakalo, as in verse 2.\n\n[265:5](sbe15105.htm#fr_856) Pradhanam avyaktam, kshetra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ o vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nanatma.\n\n[265:6](sbe15105.htm#fr_857) He binds, sustains, and dissolves worldly\nexistence.\n\n[265:7](sbe15105.htm#fr_858) He who seems to exist for a time in the form of\nkshetra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a and pradhana.\n\n[265:8](sbe15105.htm#fr_859) The MSS. vary between atmabuddhipraka _s_ am and\natmabuddhiprasadam. The former reading is here explained by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda as\nsvabuddhisakshi _n_ am.\n\n[266:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_860) Explained as Hira _n_ yagarbha.\n\n[266:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_861) Nira _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ana _m_ nirlepam.\n\n[266:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_862) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda reads tada _s_ ivam avi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\naya du _h_ khasyanto bhavishyati; Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman retains devam but\nmentions _s_ ivam as a various reading. Both have anto, not antam, like Roer.\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara seems to have found na before bhavishyati, or to have read du _h_\nkhanto na bhavishyati, for he explains that there will be no end of misery,\nunless God has first been known. It is possible, however, that the same idea\nmay be expressed in the text as we read it, so that it should mean, Only when\nthe impossible shall happen, such as the sky being rolled up by men, will\nmisery cease, unless God has been discovered in the heart.\n\n[266:4](sbe15105.htm#fr_863) The MSS, read devaprasadat, which is more in\nkeeping with the character of this Upanishad.\n\n[266:5](sbe15105.htm#fr_864) Samyak may be both adverb and adjective in this\nsentence, kakakshinyayena.\n\n[266:6](sbe15105.htm#fr_865) Atya _s_ ramin is explained by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara as\natyantam pu _g_ yatama _s_ ramibhya _h_ ; and he adds, _k_ aturvidha bhikshava\n_s_ _k_ a bahudakaku _t_ i _k_ akau, Ha _m_ sa _h_ paramaha _m_ sa _s_ _k_ a\nyo ya _h_ pa _s_ _k_ at sa uttama _h_. Weber (Indische Studien, II, 109) has\nhimself corrected his mistake of reading antya _s_ ramibhya _h_ , and\ntranslating it by neighbouring hermits.\n\nThese four stages in the life of a Sannyasin are the same to-day as they were\nin the time of the Upanishads, and Dayananda Sarasvati p. 267 describes them\nin his autobiography, though in a different order: 1. Ku _t_ i _k_ aka, living\nin a hut, or in a desolate place, and wearing a red-ochre coloured garment,\ncarrying a three-knotted bamboo rod, and wearing the hair in the centre of the\ncrown of the head, having the sacred thread, and devoting oneself to the\ncontemplation of Parabrahma. 2. Bahudaka, one who lives quite apart from his\nfamily and the world, maintains himself on alms collected at seven houses, and\nwears the same kind of reddish garment. 3. Ha _m_ sa, the same as in the\npreceding case, except the carrying of only a one-knotted bamboo. 4. Paramaha\n_m_ sa, the same as the others; but the ascetic wears the sacred thread, and\nhis hair and beard are quite long. This is the highest of all orders. A\nParamaha _m_ sa who shows himself worthy is on the very threshold of becoming\na Dikshita.\n\n[267:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_866) Cf. B _ri_ h. Up. VI, 3, 12; Maitr. Up. VI, 2 9.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: First Question](sbe15106.htm)\n\n"
