The Brahma Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n1\\. Brahma Puran\xcc\x81a. "That, the whole of which was formerly repeated by Brahma\nto Marichi, is called the Brahma Puran\xcc\x81a, and contains ten thousand stanzas\n33." In all the lists of the Puran\xcc\x81as, the Brahma is placed at the head of the\nseries, and is thence sometimes also entitled the \xc3\x81di or \'first\' Puran\xcc\x81a. It\nis also designated as the Saura, as it is in great part appropriated to the\nworship of Surya, \'the sun.\' There are, however, works bearing these names\nwhich belong to the class of Upa-puran\xcc\x81as, and which are not to be confounded\nwith the Brahma. It is usually said, as above, to contain ten thousand slokas;\nbut the number actually occurring is between seven and eight thousand. There\nis a supplementary or concluding section called the Brahmottara Puran\xcc\x81a, and\nwhich is different from a portion of the Skanda called the Brahmottara\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, which contains about three thousand stanzas more; but there is every\nreason to conclude that this is a distinct and unconnected work.\n\nThe immediate narrator of the Brahma Puran\xcc\x81a is Lomaharshan\xcc\x81a, who\ncommunicates it to the Rishis or sages assembled at Naimisharan\xcc\x81ya, as it was\noriginally revealed by Brahma, not to Marichi, as the Matsya affirms, but to\nDaksha, another of the patriarchs: hence its denomination of the Brahma\nPuran\xcc\x81a.\n\np. xvii\n\nThe early chapters of this work give a description of the creation, an account\nof the Manwantaras, and the history of the solar and lunar dynasties to the\ntime of Krishn\xcc\x81a, in a summary manner, and in words which are common to it and\nseveral other Puran\xcc\x81as: a brief description of the universe succeeds; and then\ncome a number of chapters relating to the holiness of Orissa, with its temples\nand sacred groves dedicated to the sun, to \xc5\x9aiva, and Jagannath, the latter\nespecially. These chapters are characteristic of this Puran\xcc\x81a, and shew its\nmain object to be the promotion of the worship of Krishn\xcc\x81a as Jagannath 34. To\nthese particulars succeeds a life of Krishn\xcc\x81a, which is word for word the same\nas that of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a; and the compilation terminates with a\nparticular detail of the mode in which Yoga, or contemplative devotion, the\nobject of which is still Vishn\xcc\x81u, is to be performed. There is little in this\nwhich corresponds with the definition of a Pancha-lakshan\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a; and the\nmention of the temples of Orissa, the date of the original construction of\nwhich is recorded 35, shews that it could not have been compiled earlier than\nthe thirteenth or fourteenth century.\n\nThe Uttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Brahma P. bears still more entirely the character\nof a Mahatmya, or local legend, being intended to celebrate the sanctity of\nthe Balaja river, conjectured to be the same as the Banas in Marwar. There is\nno clue to its date, but it is clearly modern, grafting personages and\nfictions of its own invention on a few hints from older authorities 36.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xvi:33](vp005.htm#fr_32) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_01600.jpg)\n\n[xvii:34](vp005.htm#fr_33) Col. Vans Kennedy objects to this character of the\nBrahma P., and observes that it contains only two short descriptions of\npagodas, the one of Konaditya, the other of Jagannath. In that case, his copy\nmust differ considerably from those I have met with; for in them the\ndescription of Purushottama Kshetra, the holy land of Orissa, runs through\nforty chapters, or one-third of the work. The description, it is true, is\ninterspersed, in the usual rambling strain of the Puran\xcc\x81as, with a variety of\nlegends, some ancient, some modern; but they are intended to illustrate some\nlocal circumstance, and are therefore not incompatible with the main design,\nthe celebration of the glories of Purushottama Kshetra. The specification of\nthe temple of Jagannath, however, is of itself sufficient, in my opinion, to\ndetermine the character and era of the compilation.\n\n[xvii:35](vp005.htm#fr_34) See Account of Orissa proper, or Cuttack, by A.\nStirling, Esq.: Asiatic Res. vol.
