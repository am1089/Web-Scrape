Should you say that on account of the denial (made by scripture) (the\nsoul of him who knows Brahman does not depart); we deny this, (because\nscripture means to say that the pra _n_ as do not depart) from the embodied\nsoul.\n\nFrom the distinction conveyed by the clause, 'and (relative) immortality\nwithout having burned' (Sutra 7), it follows that in the case of absolute\nimmortality being reached there is no going and no departure of the soul from\nthe body.--The idea that for some reason or other\n\np. 373\n\na departure of the soul might take place in this latter case also, is\nprecluded by the following scriptural passage, 'But as to the man who does not\ndesire, who, not desiring, freed from desires, is satisfied in his desires, or\ndesires the Self only, of him the vital spirits do not depart,--being Brahman,\nhe goes to Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 6). From this express denial--forming\npart of the higher knowledge--it follows that the pra _n_ as do not pass out\nof the body of him who knows Brahman.\n\nThis conclusion the purvapakshin denies. For, he says, the passage quoted does\nnot deny the departure of the pra _n_ as from the body, but from the embodied\n(individual) soul.--How is this known?--From the fact that in another _S_ akha\nwe have (not the sixth, genitive, case 'of him,' but) the fifth, ablative,\ncase 'from him'--'From him the vital spirits do not depart' (Madhyandina _S_\nakha). For the sixth case which expresses only relation in general is\ndetermined towards some special relation by the fifth case met with in another\n_S_ akha. And as the embodied soul which has a claim on exaltation and bliss\nis the chief topic of the chapter, we construe the words 'from him' to mean\nnot the body but the embodied soul. The sense therefore is 'from that soul\nwhen about to depart the pra _n_ as do not depart, but remain with it.' The\nsoul of him who dies therefore passes out of the body, together with the pra\n_n_ as. This view the next Sutra refutes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 13](sbe38293.htm)\n\n"
