The general and special duties of all castes have been explained. But we\nwill now declare those of a king in particular.\n\n2\\. He shall cause to be built a town and a palace, the gates of both of which\n(must look) towards the south.\n\n3\\. The palace (shall stand) in the heart of the town. 3\n\n4\\. In front of that (there shall be) a hall. That is called the hall of\ninvitation.\n\n5\\. (At a little distance) from the town to the south, (he shall cause to be\nbuilt) an assembly-house with doors on the south and on the north sides, so\nthat one can see what passes inside and outside.\n\n6\\. In all (these three places) fires shall burn constantly. 6\n\n7\\. And oblations must be offered in these fires daily, just as at the daily\nsacrifice of a householder. 7\n\n8\\. In the hall he shall put up his guests, at least those who are learned in\nthe Vedas. 8\n\np. 162\n\n9\\. Rooms, a couch, food and drink should be given to them according to their\ngood qualities.\n\n10\\. Let him not live better than his Gurus or ministers. 10\n\n11\\. And in his realm no (Brahma _n_ a) should suffer hunger, sickness, cold,\nor heat, be it through want, or intentionally. 11\n\n12\\. In the midst of the assembly-house, (the superintendent of the house)\nshall raise a play-table and sprinkle it with water, turning his hand\ndownwards, and place on it dice in even numbers, made of Vibhitaka (wood), as\nmany as are wanted.\n\n13\\. Men of the first three castes, who are pure and truthful, may be allowed\nto play there. 13\n\n14\\. Assaults of arms, dancing, singing, music, and the like (performances)\nshall be held only (in the houses) of the king's servants. 14\n\n15\\. That king only takes care of the welfare of his subjects in whose\ndominions, be it in villages or forests, there is no danger from thieves. 15\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[161:3](sbe0260.htm#fr_751) **25**.
