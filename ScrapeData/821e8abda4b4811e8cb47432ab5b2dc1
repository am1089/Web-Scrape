Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Ri _s_ i! Wonderful is the story of the religious\nRajar _s_ i Haris\xc2\x92chandra that you have described, the great Bhakta of S\xc2\x92atak\n_s_ i Devi! Why is that auspicious S\xc2\x92iva, the wife of S\xc2\x92iva, called S\xc2\x92atak _s_\ni? Explain to me, the cause of it, O Muni! And thus make my birth full of use\nand success. Who is there amongst the clear-minded that gets fully satisfied,\nwhen he hears the good deeds of the Devi? Each sentence, describing the good\ndeeds of the Devi, gives the undecaying fruits of As\xc2\x92vamedha Sacrifice.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n4-45. Vyasa said :-- O King. Hear; I am describing the story of S\xc2\x92atak _s_ i\nDevi. You are the great devotee of the Devi; so I have nothing that I cannot\nsay to you. In olden times, there was a great\n\n\n\np. 688\n\n\n\nDanava named Durgama: he was very cruel. He, the the son of Ruru, was born in\nthe family of Hira _n_ yak _s_ a. Once be thought within himself thus :-- \xc2\x93The\nMunis offer oblations by Mantras as ordained in the Vedas. And the Devas,\neating the clarified butter (ghee) of these oblations, get\n\nnurtured and strengthened. The Vedas is the strength of the Devas; if the\nVedas be destroyed, the Devas also would be destroyed. Thus it is advisable to\ndestroy the Vedas. (There is no other easy way.)\xc2\x94 Thus thinking, he went to\nthe Himalayas to perform tapasya. He began to meditate Brahma in the space of\nhis heart, and, taking air only, passed away his time. [Mark here that all the\nDevas reside in space, a magnitude of the Fourth Dimension.] He practised hard\ntapasya for one thousand years and the Devas and the Asuras and all the Lokas\nwere agitated by the power of his Tejas (fiery lustre). Then the Bhagavan, the\nfour-faced Brahma, became pleased with him and mounting on his carrier, the\nSwan came up there to grant him the boon. Brahma told clearly the Demon,\nsitting in Samadhi with his eyes closed, \xc2\x93Let all be well with you; now ask\nwhat you desire? Satisfied with your tapasya, I have come to grant you the\nboon.\xc2\x94 Hearing thus, the Demon got up from his Samadhi and worshipping Him\nduly, said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of the Devas! Give me all theVedas. O Mahes\xc2\x92vara! Let\nall the Vedic Mantrams, that are found in the three worlds, with the Brahma\n_n_ as and the Devas, come to me and give me such strength as would enable me\nto conquer the Devas.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, the God Brahma, the author of the four\nVedas, replied, \xc2\x93Let it be as you wish,\xc2\x94 and went away. From that time, the\nBrahma _n_ as forgot all about the Vedas. So bathing, Sandhya, daily Homas,\nS\xc2\x92raddha, sacrifice, and Japam and other rites and performances, all became\nextinct. Then a cry of universal distress arose on the surface of this wide\nearth; the Brahmi _n_ s began to say to each other :-- \xc2\x93How has this happened!\nHow has this come to pass! Now what are we to do? Where the Vedas have\ndisappeared.\xc2\x94 Thus when great calamities befell on the earth, the Devas became\ngradually weaker and weaker, not getting their share of the sacrificial Havis.\nAt this time, that Demon invested the city of Amaravati. And the Devas, not\nbeing able to fight with the Asura, of a thunder-like body fled to various\ndirections. They took refuge in the caves of the mountain Sumeru and the\ninaccessible passes of the mountain and began to meditate on the Highest\nForce, the Great Goddess. O King! When oblations of clarified butter are\noffered to the Fire, those get transferred to the Sun (Suryaloka) and get\ntransformed as rains. So when the Homa ceremonies disappeared, there was the\nscarcity of rain. The earth became quite dry and not a drop of water was found\nanywhere. The wells, tanks, pools, rivers all were dried up. And this state of\n\xc2\x93no rains\xc2\x94 lasted one hundred years. Countless people, hundreds and thou-\n\n\n\np. 689\n\n\n\nsands of cows, buffaloes and other beasts went to the jaws of death. The dead\nbodies of persons remained in heaps in every house; persons would not be found\nto perform their burning ceremonies. When such calamities were seen, the calm\nand quiet body of the Brahma _n_ s, in their earnestness to worship the\nSupreme Goddess, went to the Himalayas. They with their whole heart and\nwithout taking any food began to worship the Devi daily with their Samadhi,\nmeditation and worship. O Mahes\xc2\x92ani! Shew mercy on us. O Mother! It\xc2\x92s not\npraiseworthy to Thee to manifest Thy such anger on us, the low persons and\nguilty of all sins. So, O Deves\xc2\x92i! Forgive us. If Thou art angry on us for our\nfaults, even then we may be excused, for Thou art the Internal Ruler within us\nall and we do whatever Thou impellest us to do. (The other Devas become\npleased and give fruits when they are worshipped by Japam, and other Homa\nceremonies; but that is not even possible due to the disappearance of the\nVedic Mantrams from amongst us. But You are kind as mothers are towards their\nchildren whenever they remember.) So without Thee, there is no other rescue\nfor these people. O Mahes\xc2\x92vari! Whatever Thou willest, Thou canst do that; so\nwhat art Thou seeing again and again? O Mahes\xc2\x92ari! How can we live without\nWater, what is called the Life. Now rescue us from this great difficulty. O\nMother of the Worlds! O Mahes\xc2\x92vari! Be pleased. Oh the Ruler of the endless\ncrores of Brahma _nd_ as! Obeisance to Thee! We bow down to Thee, the\nUnchangeable, of the nature of Intelligence. We again and again make obeisance\nto Thee, the Lady of the Universe and realisable by the Vedanta words (not\nthis, not this). All the sayings of the Vedanta declare Thee, by negating (not\nthis, not this) other transient objects as the Cause of all this Universe. We\nwith all our hearts bow down to the Devi. When the body of the Brahma _n_ as\nthus praised and chanted the hymns of Mahes\xc2\x92vari, She created innumerable eyes\nwithin Her body and became visible. Her colour was dark-blue (colour of the\nfourth dimension, space) like heaps of collyrium (eye-paint); eyes like the\nblue lotuses and expanded; breasts hard, regularly elevated round and so\nfleshy that they touched each other; four handed; with Her right hand, holding\narrows; on the under hand holding lotus; on the upper-left hand holding a\ngreat bow and on the lower hand, carrying vegetables, fruits, flower and roots\nwith abundance of juice, destroying hunger, thirst and fever. She was the\nEssence of all Beauty, lovely, luminous like the thousand Suns, and the ocean\nof mercy. That Upholder of the Universe, showed Her form and began to shed\nwaters from Her eyes. For nine nights continuously, the heavy rains poured\ndown out of the waters flowing from Her eyes. Seeing the misery of all the\npeople, out of\n\n\n\np. 690\n\n\n\npity, She showered incessantly tears from Her eyes; and all the people and\nmedicines were satisfied. What more than this, out of those tears, the rivers\nbegan to flow. The Devas that remained hidden in the mountain caves, now came\nout. Then the Brahmi _n_ s, united with the Devas, began to praise and sing\nhymns to the Devi. Thou art known by the Vedanta Mahavakyas. We bow down to\nThee. Thou ordained everything to all the worlds by Thy Maya; so again and\nagain we bow down to Thee. Our Obeisance to Thee! Who art a Kalpa tree to the\nBhaktas yielding all their desires! Thou assumest the body for the Bhaktas!\nThou art always satisfied; without any equal; the Lord of the Universe! We bow\ndown to Thee. As Thou, O Devi! hast innumerable eyes only for our welfare and\npeace, therefore Thou wilt be called henceforth by the name \xc2\x93S\xc2\x92atak _s_ i.\xc2\x94 O\nMother! We are very much hungry; so we have no power to chant hymns to Thee;\ntherefore, O Mahes\xc2\x92vari? Shew mercy on us and deliver to us our Vedas.\n\n\n\n46-68. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing these words of the Devas and the Brahmi\n_n_ s, the Auspicious One gave them the vegetables, delicious fruits and roots\nto them that were on Her Hand, for their eating. After She was prayed, She\ngave to men sufficient quantity of various articles of juicy food and to the\nbeasts, grass, etc., until new crops came out. O King, from that day She\nbecame famous by the name of S\xc2\x92akambhari (because She nourished all by\nvegetables, etc.) Great tumult arose and the Demon Durgama heard all from the\nemissaries and started out to fight with his weapons and army. He took one\nthousand Ak _s_ auhi _n_ i armies with him (one Ak _s_ auhi _n_ i army equals\nlarge army consisting of 21,870 chariots, as many elephants, 65,610 horses,\nand 109,350 foot) and, shooting arrows, he came quickly before the Devi and\ninvested Her and the Deva army and the Brahmi _n_ s. At this, a great\ntumultuous uproar arose and the Devas and the Brahmi _n_ s united exclaimed\n:-- \xc2\x93O Devi! Save us; save us.\xc2\x94 The Auspicious Devi, then, for the safety of\nthe Devas and the Dvijas created round them a luminous circle and She Herself\nremained outside. The terrible fight, then, ensued between the Devi and the\nDanavas. The Sun was covered with their incessant hurling of arrows; and the\nshooters could not shoot accurately on account of the darkness that then\nprevailed. Then by the collision of the arrows of both the parties, the arrows\ncaught fire and the battlefield again became filled with light. The quarters\non all aides resounded with harsh bow sounds and nothing could be heard. At\nthis moment, came, out of the body of the Devi, the principal S\xc2\x92aktis (forces\nincarnate) Kalika, Tari _n_ i, _S_ o _d_ as\xc2\x92i, Tripura, Bhairabi, Kamala,\nBagala, Matangi, Tripura Sundari, Kamaksi, Tulaja Devi, Jambhini, Mohini,\nChchinnama _s_ ta,\n\n\n\np. 691\n\n\n\nand ten thousand armed Guhya Kalis and others. Thirty-two S\xc2\x92aktis, sixty-four\nS\xc2\x92aktis, and then innumerable S\xc2\x92aktis, all armed, came out of the Devi\nsuccessively. When the S\xc2\x92aktis destroyed one hundred Ak _s_ auhi _n_ i forces,\nMridangas, conch-shells, lutes and other musical instruments were sounded in\nthe battle-field. At this time, the enemy of the Devas, Durgama, came in front\nand first fought with the S\xc2\x92aktis. The fight grew to such a terrible extent\nthat, within ten days, all the Ak _s_ auhi _n_ i troops were destroyed. So\nmuch so as the blood of the dead soldiers began to flow in torrents like\nrivers. When the fatal eleventh day arrive the Danava, wearing red clothes on\nhis waist, red garlands on his neck and annointing his body all over with red\nsandal paste, celebrated a very grand festivity and mounted on his chariot and\nwent out to fight. With the strenuous effort, he defeated all the S\xc2\x92aktis and\nplaced his chariot before the Devi. Then a terrible fight ensued for two\nPraharas (six hours). The hearts of all shivered with horror. At this time,\nthe Devi shot fifteen very awful arrows at the Danava. His four horses\n(Vahanas) were pierced by Her four arrows; the charioteer was pierced by one\narrow; his two eyes were pierced by two arrows; his arms by two arrows, his\nflag by one arrow and his heart was pierced by five arrows. He then left his\nbody before the Devi, vomitting blood. The vital spirit, the luminous\ncounterpart, emitting from his body, merged in the space-like body of the\nDevi. The three worlds, then, assumed a peaceful appearance when that greatly\npowerful Danava was killed. Then Hari, Hara, Brahma and the other Devas began\nto praise and chant hymns to the World Mother with great devotion and in\nvoices, choked with feelings.\n\n\n\n69-73. The Devas said :-- \xc2\x93O Auspicious One! Thou art the only Cause of this\nIllusion of this world, presenting an unreal appearance (while Brahma is the\nOnly Reality). So Thou art the Lady of all the beings (otherwise why it would\nbe that Thou hast nourished all the beings with vegetables, etc). So,\nObeisance to Thee, the S\xc2\x92akambhari! Hundred-eyed! O Auspicious One! Thou art\nsung in all the Upani _s_ adas; The Destroyer of the Durgama Asura! We bow\ndown to Thee, the Lord of Maya, the Dweller in the five sheaths Anna, Rasa,\netc. We meditate upon Thee, the Lady of the universe, as demonstrated by Pra\n_n_ ava Aum, whom the chief Munis meditate with their Nirvikalpa hearts\n(hearts free from any Vikalpa, doubts or ignorance). Thou art the Mother of\nthe endless crores of universe! Thou assumest the Divine Bodies at times for\nour welfare! Thou art the Mother of Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and others; we bow down\nto Thee with all our heart.\n\n\n\np. 692\n\n\n\nThou art the Mother of all; so, out of mercy, Thou hast shed tears from the\nhundred eyes, to remove the miseries of the low humble persons. Thou art the\nRuler of all!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n74-80. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus when Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Hara and the other\nDevas praised and chanted various hymns to the Devi and worshipped Her with\nvarious excellent articles, She became instantly pleased. Then the Devi,\ngraciously pleased, handed over the Vedas to the Brahma _n_ as. At last, She,\nthe Cuckoo-voiced, made a special address to them. \xc2\x93These Vedas are the\nexcellent parts of My body. So preserve these with your greatest care. The\nmore so, when you all have seen with your own eyes what a great calamity\nbefell on you when these Vedas went away out of your hands! You should all\nworship and serve Me (the Controller of the Space) always; there is no other\nthing higher than this that I can advise you for your welfare. Read always\nthese My excellent glorious deeds. I will be pleased thereby and will destroy\nall your bad calamities and misfortunes. My name is Durga, because I have\nkilled this demon Durgama; so he, who will take My name Durga and S\xc2\x92atak _s_\ni, he will be able to unveil my Maya and walk freely. No use in telling more\nthan this that I tell you now, O Devas, the Essence of all essences :-- Both\nthe Suras and the Asuras would always serve Me and Me, alone.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n81-83. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus giving pleasures to the Devas by these\nwords, the Devi of the nature of Existence, Intelligence and Bliss disappeared\nbefore them. O King! This Grand Mystery I have described to you in detail; but\nthis is the source of good to all; so keep it secret with every care. The\nperson that hears daily with great devotion this Chapter, gets all that he\nwants and at last gets the worship in the Devi Loka.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-eighth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the glory of the\nS'atak _s_ i Devi in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000\nverses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 29](bk07ch29.htm)\n\n"
