Here (with regard to obtaining Hira _n_ yagarbha) there are these _S_\nlokas:\n\np. 233\n\n2\\. The fivefold body into which the indestructible (pra _n_ a, breath)\nenters, that body which the harnessed horses (the senses) draw about, that\nbody where the true of the true (the highest Brahman) follows after, in that\nbody (of the worshipper) all gods 1 become one.\n\n3\\. That body into which goes the indestructible (the breath) which we have\njoined (in meditation), proceeding from the indestructible (the highest\nBrahman), that body which the harnessed horses (the senses) draw about, that\nbody where the true of the true follows after, in that body all gods become\none.\n\n4\\. After separating themselves from the Yes and No of language, and of all\nthat is hard and cruel, poets have discovered (what they sought for);\ndependent on names they rejoiced in what had been revealed 2.\n\n5\\. That in which the poets rejoiced (the revealed nature of pra _n_ a,\nbreath), in it the gods exist all joined together. Having driven away evil by\nmeans of that Brahman (which is hidden in pra _n_ a), the enlightened man goes\nto the Svarga world (becomes one with Hira _n_ yagarbha 3, the universal\nspirit).\n\n6\\. No one wishing to describe him (pra _n_ a, breath) by speech, describes\nhim by calling him 'woman,' 'neither woman nor man,' or 'man' (all such names\napplying only to the material body, and not to pra _n_ a or breath).\n\np. 234\n\n7\\. Brahman (as hidden beneath pra _n_ a) is called the A; and the I (ego) is\ngone there (the worshipper should know that he is uktha and pra _n_ a).\n\n8\\. This becomes perfect as a thousand of B _ri_ hati verses, and of that\nhymn, perfect with a thousand Brihad verses, there are 36,000 syllables. So\nmany are also the thousands of days of human life 1. By means of the syllable\nof life (the a) alone (which is contained in that thousand of hymns) does a\nman obtain the day of life (the mahavrata day, which completes the number of\nthe days in the Gavamayana, sacrifice), and by means of the day of life (he\nobtains) the syllable of life.\n\n9\\. Now there is a chariot of the god (pra _n_ a) destroying all desires (for\nthe worlds of Indra, the moon, the earth, all of which lie below the place of\nHira _n_ yagarbha). Its front part (the point of the two shafts of the\ncarriage where the yoke is fastened) is speech, its wheels the cars, the\nhorses the eyes, the driver the mind. Pra _n_ a (breath) mounts that chariot\n(and on it, i. e. by means of meditating on Pra _n_ a, he reaches Hira _n_\nyagarbha).\n\n10\\. This has been said by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. X, 39, 12):--\n\n11\\. 'Come hither on that which is quicker than mind,' and (Rv. VIII, 73, 2)\n'Come hither on that which is quicker than the twinkling of an eye,' yea, the\ntwinkling of an eye 2.\n\np. 235\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[232:1](sbe01220.htm#fr_577) The last line on page 246 should, I think, be the\npenultimate line of page 247.\n\n[232:2](sbe01220.htm#fr_578) The body consists of six elements, and is hence\ncalled sha _t_ kau _s_ ika. Of these, three having a white appearance (fat,\nbone, and marrow), come from the sun and from man; three having a. red\nappearance, come from fire and from the woman.\n\n[232:3](sbe01220.htm#fr_579) It is well therefore to shake off this body, and\nby meditating on the uktha to obtain identity with Hira _n_ yagarbha. Comm.\n\n[233:1](sbe01221.htm#fr_580) The worshipper identifies himself by meditation\nwith pra _n_ a, breath, which comprehends all gods. These gods (Agni and the\nrest) appear in the forms of speech, &c. Comm.\n\n[233:2](sbe01221.htm#fr_581) The pra _n_ a, breath, and their identity with it\nthrough meditation or worship. Comm.\n\n[233:3](sbe01221.htm#fr_582) Sarvahammani hira _n_ yagarbha iti _s_ rute _h_.\nComm.\n\n[234:1](sbe01221.htm#fr_583) Cf. 11, 2, 4, 4.\n\n[234:2](sbe01221.htm#fr_584) The commentator remarks that the worship and\nmeditation on the uktha as pra _n_ a, as here taught, is different from the\npra _n_ avidya, the knowledge of pra _n_ a, taught in the _Kh_ andogya, the B\n_ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, &c., where pra _n_ a or life is represented as the\nobject of meditation, without any reference to the uktha or other portions of\nthe Mahavrata ceremony. He enjoins that the meditation on p. 235 the uktha as\npra _n_ a should be continued till the desired result, the identification of\nthe worshipper with pra _n_ a, is realised, and that it should afterwards be\nrepeated until death, because otherwise the impression might vanish, and the\nreward of becoming a god, and going to the gods, be lost. Nor is the worship\nto be confined to the time of the sacrifice, the Mahavrata, only, but it has\nto be repeated mentally during life. There are neither certain postures\nrequired for it, nor certain times and places. At the time of death, however,\nhe who has become perfect in this meditation on uktha, as the emblem of pra\n_n_ a, will have his reward. Up to a certain point his fate will be the same\nas that of other people. The activity of the senses will be absorbed in the\nmind, the activity of the mind in breath, breath in the activity of life, life\nwith breath in the five elements, fire, &c., and these five elements will be\nabsorbed up to their seed in the Paramatman or Highest Self. This ends the old\nbirth. But then the subtile body, having been absorbed in the Highest Self,\nrises again in the lotus of the heart, and passing out by the channel of the\nhead, reaches a ray of the sun, whether by day or by night, and goes at the\nnorthern or southern course of the sun to the road of Ar _k_ is or light. That\nAr _k_ is, light, and other powers carry him on, and led by these he reaches\nthe Brahma-loka, where he creates to himself every kind of enjoyment,\naccording to his wish. He may create for himself a material body and enjoy all\nsorts of pleasures, as if in a state of waking, or he may, without such a\nbody, enjoy all pleasures in mind only, as if in a dream. And as he creates\nthese various bodies according to his wish, he creates also living souls in\neach, endowed with the internal organs of mind, and moves about in them, as he\npleases. In fact this world is the same for the devotee (yogin) and for the\nHighest Self, except that creative power belongs truly to the latter only. At\nlast the devotee gains the highest knowledge, that of the Highest Self in\nhimself, and then, at the dissolution of the Brahma-loka, he obtains complete\nfreedom with Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 1](sbe01222.htm)\n\n"
