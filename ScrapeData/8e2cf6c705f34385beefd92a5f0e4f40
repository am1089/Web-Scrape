IV.\n\nThe progeny of Sagara: their wickedness: he performs an A\xc5\x9bwamedha: the horse\nstolen by Kapila: found by Sagara\'s sons, who are all destroyed by the sage:\nthe horse recovered by An\xc5\x9bumat: his descendants. Legend of Mitrasaha or\nKalmashapada, the son of Sudasa. Legend of Khat\xcc\x81wanga. Birth of Rama and the\nother sons of Da\xc5\x9baratha. Epitome of the history of Rama: his descendants, and\nthose of his brothers. Line of Ku\xc5\x9ba. Vrihadbala, the last, killed in the great\nwar.\n\nSUMATI the daughter of Ka\xc5\x9byapa, and Kesini the daughter of Raja Viderbha, were\nthe two wives of Sagara 1. Being without progeny, the king solicited the aid\nof the sage Aurva with great earnestness, and the Muni pronounced this boon,\nthat one wife should bear one son, the upholder of his race, and the other\nshould give birth to sixty thousand sons; and he left it to them to make their\nelection. Kesini chose to have the single son; Sumati the multitude: and it\ncame to pass in a short time that the former bore Asamanjas 2, a prince\nthrough whom the dynasty continued; and the daughter of Vinata (Sumati) had\nsixty thousand sons. The son of Asamanjas was An\xc5\x9bumat.\n\nAsamanjas was from his boyhood of very irregular conduct. His father hoped\nthat as he grew up to manhood he would reform; but finding that he continued\nguilty of the same immorality, Sagara abandoned him. The sixty thousand sons\nof Sagara followed the example of their brother Asamanjas. The path of virtue\nand piety being obstructed in the world by the sons of Sagara, the gods\nrepaired to the Muni Kapila, who was a portion of Vishn\xcc\x81u, free from fault,\nand endowed with all true wisdom. Having approached him with respect, they\nsaid, "O lord, what will become of the world, if these sons of Sagara are\npermitted to go on in the evil ways which they have learned from Asamanjas! Do\nthou, then, assume a visible form, for the protection of the afflicted\n\np. 378\n\nuniverse." "Be satisfied," replied the sage, "in a brief time the sons of\nSagara shall be all destroyed."\n\nAt that period Sagara commenced the performance of the solemn sacrifice of a\nhorse, who was guarded by his own sons: nevertheless some one stole the\nanimal, and carried it off into a chasm in the earth, Sagara commanded his\nsons to search for the steed; and they, tracing him by the impressions of his\nhoofs, followed his course with perseverance, until coming to the chasm where\nhe had entered, they proceeded to enlarge it, and dug downwards each for a\nleague. Coming to Patala, they beheld the horse wandering freely about, and at\nno great distance from him they saw the Rishi Kapila sitting, with his head\ndeclined in meditation, and illuminating the surrounding space with radiance\nas bright as the splendours of the autumnal sun, shining in an unclouded sky.\nExclaiming, "This is the villain who has maliciously interrupted our\nsacrifice, and stolen the horse! kill him! kill him!" they ran towards him\nwith uplifted weapons. The Muni slowly raised his eyes, and for an instant\nlooked upon them, and they were reduced to ashes by the sacred flame that\ndarted from his person 3.\n\nWhen Sagara learned that his sons, whom he had sent in pursuit of the\nsacrificial steed, had been destroyed by the might of the great Rishi Kapila,\nhe dispatched An\xc5\x9bumat, the son of Asamaujas, to effect the animals recovery.\nThe youth, proceeding by the deep path which the princes had dug, arrived\nwhere Kapila was, and bowing respectfully, prayed to him, and so propitiated\nhim, that the saint said, "Go, my\n\np. 379\n\nson, deliver the horse to your grandfather; and demand a boon; thy grandson\nshall bring down the river of heaven on the earth." An\xc5\x9bumat requested as a\nboon that his uncles, who had perished through the sage\'s displeasure, might,\nalthough unworthy of it, be raised to heaven through his favour. "I have told\nyou," replied Kapila, "that your grandson shall bring down upon earth the\nGanges of the gods; and when her waters shall wash the bones and ashes of thy\ngrandfather\'s sons, they shall be raised to Swarga. Such is the efficacy of\nthe stream that flows from the toe of Vishn\xcc\x81u, that it confers heaven upon all\nwho bathe in it designedly, or who even become accidentally immersed in it:\nthose even shall obtain Swarga, whose bones, skin, fibres, hair, or any other\npart, shall be left after death upon the earth which is contiguous to the\nGanges." Having acknowledged reverentially the kindness of the sage, An\xc5\x9bumat\nreturned to his grandfather, and delivered to him the horse. Sagara, on\nrecovering the steed, completed his sacrifice; and in affectionate memory of\nhis sons, denominated Sagara the chasm which they had dug 4.\n\nThe son of An\xc5\x9bumat was Dilipa 5; his son was Bhagiratha, who brought Ganga\ndown to earth, whence she is called Bhagirathi. The son of Bhagiratha was\n\xc5\x9aruta 6; his son was Nabhaga 7; his son was Ambarisha; his son was\nSindhudwipa; his son was Ayuta\xc5\x9bwa 8; his son was Rituparn\xcc\x81a, the friend of\nNala, skilled profoundly in dice 9. The\n\np. 380\n\nson of Rituparn\xcc\x81a was Sarvakama 10; his son was Sudasa; his son was Saudasa,\nnamed also Mitrasaha 11.\n\np. 381\n\nThe son of Sudasa having gone into the woods to hunt, fell in with a couple of\ntigers, by whom the forest had been cleared of the deer. The king slew one of\nthese tigers with an arrow. At the moment of expiring, the form of the animal\nwas changed, and it became that of a fiend of fearful figure, and hideous\naspect. Its companion, threatening the prince with its vengeance, disappeared.\n\nAfter some interval Saudasa celebrated a sacrifice, which was conducted by\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. At the close of the rite Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha went out; when the Rakshas,\nthe fellow of the one that had been killed in the figure of a tiger, assumed\nthe semblance of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, and came and said to the king, "Now that the\nsacrifice is ended, you must give me flesh to eat: let it be cooked, and I\nwill presently return." Having said this, he withdrew, and, transforming\nhimself into the shape of the cook, dressed some human flesh, which he brought\nto the king, who, receiving it on a plate of gold, awaited the reappearance of\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. As soon as the Muni returned, the king offered to him the dish.\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha surprised at such want of propriety in the king, as his offering\nhim meat to eat, considered what it should be that was so presented, and by\nthe efficacy of his meditations discovered that it was human flesh. His mind\nbeing agitated with wrath, he denounced a curse upon the Raja, saying,\n"Inasmuch as you have insulted all such holy men as we are, by giving me what\nis not to be eaten, your appetite shall henceforth be excited by similar\nfood."\n\n"It was yourself," replied the Raja to the indignant sage, "who commanded this\nfood to be prepared." "By me!" exclaimed Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha; "how could that have\nbeen?" and again having recourse to meditation, he detected the whole truth.\nForegoing then all displeasure towards the king, he said, "The food to which I\nhave sentenced you shall not be your sustenance for ever; it shall only be so\nfor twelve years." The king, who had taken up water in the palms of his hands,\nand was prepared to curse the Muni, now considered that Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha was his\nspiritual guide, and being reminded by Madayanti his queen that it ill became\nhim to denounce an imprecation upon a holy teacher, who was the guardian\ndivinity of his race, abandoned his intention.\n\np. 382\n\n[paragraph continues] Unwilling to cast the water upon the earth, lest it\nshould wither up the grain, for it was impregnated with his malediction, and\nequally reluctant to throw it up into the air, lest it should blast the\nclouds, and dry up their contents, he threw it upon, his own feet. Scalded by\nthe heat which the water had derived from his angry imprecation, the feet of\nthe Raja became spotted black and white, and he thence obtained the name of\nKalmashapada, or he with the spotted (kalmasha) feet (pada).\n\nIn consequence of the curse of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, the Raja became a cannibal every\nsixth watch of the day for twelve years, and in that state wandered through\nthe forests, and devoured multitudes of men. On one occasion he beheld a holy\nperson engaged in dalliance with his wife. As soon as they saw his terrific\nform, they were frightened, and endeavoured to escape; but the regal Rakshasa\novertook and seized the husband. The wife of the Brahman then also desisted\nfrom flight, and earnestly entreated the savage to spare her lord, exclaiming,\n"Thou, Mitrasaha, art the pride of the royal house of Ikshwaku, not a\nmalignant fiend! it is not in thy nature, who knowest the characters of women,\nto carry off and devour my husband." But all was in vain, and, regardless of\nher reiterated supplications, he ate the Brahman, as a tiger devours a deer.\nThe Brahman\'s wife, furious with wrath, then addressed the Raja, and said,\n"Since you have barbarously disturbed the joys of a wedded pair, and killed my\nhusband, your death shall be the consequence of your associating with your\nqueen." So saying, she entered the flames.\n\nAt the expiration of the period of his curse Saudasa returned home. Being\nreminded of the imprecation of the Brahmani by his wife Madayanti, he\nabstained from conjugal intercourse, and was in consequence childless; but\nhaving solicited the interposition of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, Madayanti became pregnant.\nThe child, however, was not born for seven years, when the queen, becoming\nimpatient, divided the womb with a sharp stone, and was thereby delivered. The\nchild was thence called A\xc5\x9bmaka (from A\xc5\x9bman, \'a stone\'). The son of A\xc5\x9bmaka was\nMulaka, who, when the warrior tribe was extirpated upon earth, was surrounded\nand concealed by a number of females; whence he was denominated Narikavacha\n\np. 383\n\n[paragraph continues] (having women for armour) 12. The son of Mulaka was\nDa\xc5\x9baratha; his son was Ilavila; his son was Vi\xc5\x9bwasaha; his son was Khat\xcc\x81wanga,\ncalled also Dilipa 13, who in a battle between the gods and the Asuras, being\ncalled by the former to their succour, killed a number of the latter. Having\nthus acquired the friendship of the deities in heaven, they desired him to\ndemand a boon. He said to them, "If a boon is to be accepted by me, then tell\nme, as a favour, what is the duration of my life." "The length of your life is\nbut an hour," the gods replied. On which, Khat\xcc\x81wanga, who was swift of motion,\ndescended in his easy-gliding chariot to the world of mortals. Arrived there,\nhe prayed, and said, "If my own soul has never been dearer to me than the\nsacred Brahmans; if I have never deviated from the discharge of my duty; if I\nhave never regarded gods, men, animals, vegetables, all created things, as\ndifferent from the imperishable; then may I, with unswerving step, attain to\nthat divine being on whom holy sages meditate!" Having thus spoken, he was\nunited with that supreme being, who is Vasudeva; with that elder of all the\ngods, who is abstract existence, and whose form cannot be described. Thus he\nobtained absorption, according to this stanza, which was repeated formerly by\nthe seven Rishis; "Like unto Khat\xcc\x81wanga will be no one upon earth, who having\ncome from heaven, and dwelt an hour amongst men, became united with the three\nworlds by his liberality and knowledge of truth 14."\n\nThe son of Khat\xcc\x81wanga was Dirghabahu; his son was Raghu; his son was Aja; his\nson was Da\xc5\x9baratha 15. The god from whose navel the\n\np. 384\n\nlotus springs became fourfold, as the four sons of Da\xc5\x9baratha, Rama,\nLakshman\xcc\x81a, Bharata, and \xc5\x9aatrughna, for the protection of the world. Rama,\nwhilst yet a boy, accompanied Viswamitra, to protect his sacrifice, and slew\nTad\xcc\x81aka. He afterwards killed Maricha with his resistless shafts; and Subahu\nand others fell by his arms. He removed the guilt of Ahalya by merely looking\nupon her. In the palace of Janaka he broke with ease the mighty bow of\nMahe\xc5\x9bwara, and received the hand of Sita, the daughter of the king, self-born\nfrom the earth, as the prize of his prowess. He humbled the pride of\nPara\xc5\x9burama, who vaunted his triumphs over the race of Haihaya, and his\nrepeated slaughters of the Kshatriya tribe. Obedient to the commands of his\nfather, and cherishing no regret for the loss of sovereignty, he entered the\nforest,\n\np. 385\n\naccompanied by his brother Lakshman\xcc\x81a and by his wife, where he killed in\nconflict Viradha, Kharadushana and other Rakshasas, the headless giant\nKabandha, and Bali the monkey monarch. Having built a bridge across the ocean,\nand destroyed the whole Rakshasa nation, he recovered his bride Sita, whom\ntheir ten-headed king Ravan\xcc\x81a had carried off, and returned to Ayodhya with\nher, after she had been purified by the fiery ordeal from the soil contracted\nby her captivity, and had been honoured by the assembled gods, who bore\nwitness to her virtue 16.\n\nBharata made himself master of the country of the Gandharbas, after destroying\nvast numbers of them; and \xc5\x9aatrughna having killed the Rakshasa chief Lavan\xcc\x81a,\nthe son of Madhu, took possession of his capital Mathura.\n\nHaving thus, by their unequalled valour and might, rescued the whole world\nfrom the dominion of malignant fiends, Rama, Lakshman\xcc\x81a, Bharata, and\n\xc5\x9aatrughna reascended to heaven, and were followed by those of the people of\nKo\xc5\x9bala who were fervently devoted to these incarnate portions of the supreme\nVishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nRama and his brothers had each two sons. Ku\xc5\x9ba and Lava were the sous of Rama;\nthose of Lakshman\xcc\x81a were Angada and Chandraketu; the sons of Bharata were\nTaksha and Pushkara; and Subahu and \xc5\x9aurasena 17 were the sons of \xc5\x9aatrughna.\n\np. 386\n\nThe son of Ku\xc5\x9ba was Atithi; his son was Nishadha; his son was Nala 18; his son\nwas Nabhas; his son was Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arika; his son was Kshemadhanwan; his son was\nDevanika; his son was Ahinagu 19; his son was Paripatra; his son was Dala 20;\nhis son was Chhala 21; his son was Uktha 22; his son was Vajranabha; his son\nwas \xc5\x9aankhanabha 23; his son was Abhyutthita\xc5\x9bwa 24; his son was Vi\xc5\x9bwasaha 25;\nhis son was Hiran\xcc\x81yanabha, who was a pupil of the mighty Yogi Jaimini, and\ncommunicated the knowledge of spiritual exercises to Yajnawalkya 26. The son\nof this\n\np. 387\n\nsaintly king was Pushya; his son was Dhruvasandhi 27; his son was Sudar\xc5\x9bana;\nhis son was Agnivarn\xcc\x81a; his son was \xc5\x9aighra; his son was Maru 28, who through\nthe power of devotion (Yoga) is still living in the village called Kalapa, and\nin a future age will be the restorer of the Kshatriya race in the solar\ndynasty. Maru had a son named Prasu\xc5\x9bruta; his son was Susandhi; his son was\nAmarsha; his son was Mahaswat 29; his son was Vi\xc5\x9brutavat 30; and his son was\nVrihadbala, who was killed in the great war by Abhimanyu, the son of Anjuna.\nThese are the most distinguished princes in the family of Ikshwaku: whoever\nlistens to the account of them will be purified from all his sins 31.}\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[377:1](vp096.htm#fr_989) So the Ramayan\xcc\x81a. Sumati is called the daughter of\nArisht\xcc\x81anemi: the Mahabharata calls her \xc5\x9aaivya. The story of Sagara and his\ndescendants is told at length in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, first book, and in the\nMahabharata, Vana Parva, III. 106, et seq., as well as in most of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as.\n\n[377:2](vp096.htm#fr_990) Or Panchajana: Brahma.\n\n[378:3](vp096.htm#fr_991) The Bhagavata has, for a Puran\xcc\x81a, some curious\nremarks on this part of the story, flatly denying its truth. \'The report is\nnot true, that the sons of the king were scorched by the wrath of the sage;\nfor how can the quality of darkness, made up of anger, exist in a world-\npurifying nature, consisting of the quality of goodness; the dust of earth, as\nit were, in the sky? How should mental perturbation distract that sage, who\nwas one with the supreme, and who has promulgated that Sankhya philosophy,\nwhich is a strong vessel, by which he who is desirous of liberation passes\nover the dangerous ocean of the world by the path of death?\'\n\n[379:4](vp096.htm#fr_992) Sagara is still the name of the ocean, and\nespecially of the bay of Bengal, at the mouth of the Ganges. On the shore of\nthe island called by the same name, tradition places a Kapila\xc5\x9brama, or\nhermitage of Kapila, which is still the scene of an annual pilgrimage. Other\nlegends assign a very different situation for the abode of the ascetic, or the\nfoot of the Himalaya, where the Ganges descends to the plains. There would be\nno incompatibility, however, in the two sites, could we imagine the tradition\nreferred to a period when the ocean washed, as it appears once to have done,\nthe base of the Himalaya, and Saugor (Sagara) was at Haridwar.\n\n[379:5](vp096.htm#fr_993) Or Khat\xcc\x81wanga: Brahma and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba: but this is\napparently an error. See note 14.\n\n[379:6](vp096.htm#fr_994) Omitted: Matsya and Agni. Vi\xc5\x9bruta: Linga.\n\n[379:7](vp096.htm#fr_995) Nabhin: Bhagavata.\n\n[379:8](vp096.htm#fr_996) Ayutayus: Vayu, Linga, and Kurma. \xc5\x9arutayus: Agni.\nAyutajit: Brahma.\n\n[379:9](vp096.htm#fr_997) \'knowing the heart of the dice.\' The same epithet,\nas well as that of \'friend of Nala,\' is given him in the Vayu, Bhagavata, and\nBrahma Puran\xcc\x81as, p. 380 and in the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, and leaves no doubt of their\nreferring to the hero of the story told in the Mahabharata. Nara however, as\nwe shall hereafter see, is some twenty generations later than Rituparn\xcc\x81a in\nthe same family; and the Vayu therefore thinks it necessary to observe that\ntwo Nalas are noticed in the Puran\xcc\x81as, and the one here adverted to is the son\nof Virasena; whilst the other belongs to the family of Ikshwaku. The same\npassage occurs in the Brahma P. and Hari V.; and the commentator on the latter\nobserves, \'Nala the son of Nishadha is different from Nala the son of\nVirasena.\' It is also to be observed, that the Nala of the tale is king of\nNishadha, and his friend Rituparn\xcc\x81a is king of Ayodhya. The Nala of the race\nof Ikshwaku is king of Ayodhya: he is the son of Nishadha, however, and there\nis evidently some confusion between the two. We do not find Virasena or his\nson in any of the lists. See n. 19.\n\n[380:10](vp096.htm#fr_998) There is considerable variety in this part of the\nlists, but the Vayu and Bhagavata agree with our text. The Matsya and others\nmake Kalmashapada the son or grandson of Rituparn\xcc\x81a, and place Sarvakama or\nSarvakarman after him. See further on.\n\n[380:11](vp096.htm#fr_999) The Vayu, Agni, Brahma, and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba read\nAmitrasaha, \'foe-enduring;\' but the commentator on our text explains it Mitra,\na name of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, Saha, \'able to bear\' the imprecation of; as in the\nfollowing legend, which is similarly related in the Bhagavata. It is not\ndetailed in the Vayu. A full account occurs in the Mahabharata, \xc3\x81di P., s.\n176, but with many and important variations. Kalmashapada, whilst hunting,\nencountered \xc5\x9aaktri, the son of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, in the woods; and on his refusing\nto make way, struck the sage with his whip. \xc5\x9aaktri cursed the king to become a\ncannibal; and Viswamitra, who had a quarrel with Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, seized the\nopportunity to direct a Rakshas to take possession of the king, that he might\nbecome the instrument of destroying the family of the rival saint. Whilst thus\ninfluenced, Mitrasaha, a Brahman, applied to Kalmashapada for food, and the\nking commanded his cook to dress human flesh, and give it to the Brahman, who,\nknowing what it was, repeated the curse of \xc5\x9aaktri, that the king should become\na cannibal; which taking effect with double force, Kalmashapada began to eat\nmen. One of his first victims was \xc5\x9aaktri, whom he slew and ate; and then\nkilled and devoured, under the secret impulse of Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra\'s demon, all the\nother sons of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha however liberated him from the Rakshas\nwho possessed him, and restored him to his natural character. The imprecation\nof the Brahman\'s wife, and its consequences, are told in the Mahabharata as in\nthe text; but the story of the water falling on his feet appears to have grown\nout of the etymology of his name, which might have referred to some disease of\nthe lower extremities, the prince\'s designation being at length, Mitrasaha\nSaudasa Kalmashapada, or Mitrasaha, son of Sudasa, with the swelled feet.\n\n[383:12](vp096.htm#fr_1000) His name Mulaka, or \'the root,\' refers also to his\nbeing the stem whence the Kshatriya races again proceeded. It may be doubted\nif the purport of his title Narikavacha is accurately explained by the text.\n\n[383:13](vp096.htm#fr_1001) This prince is confounded with an earlier Dilipa\nby the Brahma P. and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba.\n\n[383:14](vp096.htm#fr_1002) The term for his obtaining final liberation is\nrather unusual; \'By whom the three worlds were affected or beloved:\' the three\nworlds being identified with their source, or the supreme. The text says of\nthis stanza ###, and the Vayu, citing it, says ###, the legend is therefore\nfrom the Vedas.\n\n[383:15](vp096.htm#fr_1003) The lists here differ very materially, as the\nfollowing comparison will best shew: p. 384\n\nVishn\xcc\x81u.\n\n|\n\nMatsya.\n\n|\n\nRamayan\xcc\x81a.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nKalmashapada\n\n|\n\nKalmashapada\n\n|\n\nKalmashapada  \n  \nA\xc5\x9bmaka\n\n|\n\nSarvakarman\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9aankana  \n  \nMulaka\n\n|\n\nAnaran\xcc\x81ya\n\n|\n\nSudar\xc5\x9bana  \n  \nDa\xc5\x9baratha\n\n|\n\nNighna\n\n|\n\nAgnivarn\xcc\x81a  \n  \nIlavila\n\n|\n\nAnamitra\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9aighraga  \n  \nVi\xc5\x9bwasaha\n\n|\n\nRaghu\n\n|\n\nMaru  \n  \nDilipa\n\n|\n\nDilipa\n\n|\n\nPrasusruka  \n  \nDirghabahu\n\n|\n\nAja\n\n|\n\nAmbarisha  \n  \nRaghu\n\n|\n\nDirghabahu\n\n|\n\nNahusha  \n  \nAja\n\n|\n\nAjapala\n\n|\n\nYayati  \n  \nDa\xc5\x9baratha\n\n|\n\nDa\xc5\x9baratha\n\n|\n\nNabhaga  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\nAja  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\nDa\xc5\x9baratha.  \n  \n[paragraph continues] The Vayu, Bhagavata, Kurma, and Linga agree with our\ntext, except in the reading of a few names; as \xc5\x9aataratha for Da\xc5\x9baratha the\nfirst; Vairivira for Ilavila; and Kritasarman, Vriddhasarman, or\nVriddhakarman, for Vi\xc5\x9bwasaha. The Agni and Brahma and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba agree with\nthe second series, with similar occasional exceptions; shewing that the\nPuran\xcc\x81as admit two series, differing in name, but agreeing in number. The\nRamayan\xcc\x81a, however, differs from both in a very extraordinary manner, and the\nvariation is not limited to the cases specified, as it begins with Bhagiratha,\nas follows:\n\nPuran\xcc\x81as.\n\n|\n\nRamayan\xcc\x81a.  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nBhagiratha\n\n|\n\nBhagiratha  \n  \n\xc5\x9aruta\n\n|\n\nKakutshtha  \n  \nNabhaga\n\n|\n\nRaghu  \n  \nAmbarisha\n\n|\n\nKalmashapada  \n  \nSindhudwipa\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nAyuta\xc5\x9bwa\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nRituparn\xcc\x81a\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nSarvakama\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nSudasa\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nKalmashapada.\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[paragraph continues] The entire Pauran\xcc\x81ik series comprises twenty descents,\nand that of the Ramayan\xcc\x81a sixteen. Some of the last names of the poem occur\namongst the first of those of the Puran\xcc\x81as, but there is an irreconcilable\ndifference in much of the nomenclature. The Agni, under the particular account\nof the descent of Rama, has for his immediate predecessors Raghu, Aja,\nDa\xc5\x9baratha, as in our text; and the author of the Raghu Van\xc5\x9ba agrees with the\nPuran\xcc\x81as from Dilipa downwards.\n\n[385:16](vp096.htm#fr_1004) This is an epitome of the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, the heroic\npoem of Valmiki, on the subject of Rama\'s exploits. A part of the Ramayan\xcc\x81a\nwas published, with a translation by Messrs. Carey and Marshman, several years\nsince; but a much more correct edition of the text of the two first books,\nwith a Latin translation of the first, and part of the second, have been more\nrecently published by Professor Schlegel; a work worthy of his illustrious\nname. A summary of the story may be found in Sir Wm. Jones\'s Works, Maurice\'s\nHindustan, Moor\'s Pantheon, &c. It is also the subject of the Uttara Rama\nCharitra in the Hindu Theatre, in the introduction to which an outline of the\nwhole is given. The story is therefore, no doubt, sufficiently familiar even\nto English readers. It seems to be founded on historical fact; and the\ntraditions of the south of India uniformly ascribe its civilization, the\nsubjugation or dispersion of its forest tribes of barbarians, and the\nsettlement of civilized Hindus, to the conquest of Lanka by Rama.\n\n[385:17](vp096.htm#fr_1005) The Vayu specifies the countries or cities over\nwhich they reigned. Anguda and Chitraketu, as the Vayu terms the latter,\ngoverned countries near the Himalaya, p. 386 the capitals of which were \xc3\x81ngadi\nand Chandravaktra. Taksha and Pushkara were sovereigns of Gandhara, residing\nat Taksha\xc5\x9bila and Pushkaravati. Subahu and \xc5\x9aurasena reigned at Mathura; and in\nthe latter we might be satisfied to find the \xc5\x9aurasenas of Arrian, but that\nthere is a subsequent origin, of perhaps greater authenticity, in the family\nof Yadu, as we shall hereafter see. \'Ku\xc5\x9ba built Ku\xc5\x9basthali on the brow of the\nVindhya, the capital of Ko\xc5\x9bala; and Lava reigned at \xc5\x9aravasti (see p.\n[355](vp093.htm#page_355). [361](vp094.htm#page_361)) in Uttara (northern)\nKo\xc5\x9bala:\' &c. The Raghu Vaasa describes Ku\xc5\x9ba as returning from Ku\xc5\x9bavati to\nAyodhya, after his father\'s death; but it seems not unlikely that the\nextending power of the princes of the Doab, of the lunar family, compelled\nRama\'s posterity to retire more to the west and south.\n\n[386:18](vp096.htm#fr_1006) The Bhagavata is the only Puran\xcc\x81a that omits this\nname, as if the author had been induced to correct the reading in order to\navoid the necessity of recognising two Nalas. See above, n. 9.\n\n[386:19](vp096.htm#fr_1007) Here again we have two distinct series of princes,\nindependently of variations of individual names. Instead of the list of the\ntext, with which the Vayu and Bhagavata nearly, and the Brahma and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba\nindifferently conform, we have in the [Matsya](errata.htm#18), Linga, Kurma,\nand Agni the following: Ahinagu, Sahasra\xc5\x9bwa, Sahasraya or Sahasrabala,\nChandravaloka, Tarapid\xcc\x81a or Taradhi\xc5\x9ba, Chandragiri, Bhanuratha or Bhanumitra,\nand \xc5\x9arutayus, with whom the list ends, except in the Linga, which adds Bahula,\nkilled by Abhimanyu: enumerating therefore from Devanika but seven or eight\nprinces to the great war, instead of twenty-three, as in the other series. The\nRaghu Vaasa gives much the same list as our text, ending with Agnivarn\xcc\x81a.\n\n[386:20](vp096.htm#fr_1008) Bala: Bhagavata. Nala: Hari V.\n\n[386:21](vp096.htm#fr_1009) Sthala: Bhagavata. \xc5\x9aala: Vayu and Brahma. \xc5\x9aila:\nRaghu Van\xc5\x9ba.\n\n[386:22](vp096.htm#fr_1010) Omitted: Bhagavata.\n\n[386:23](vp096.htm#fr_1011) \xc5\x9aankha: Brahma. Khagana: Bhag.\n\n[386:24](vp096.htm#fr_1012) Dushita\xc5\x9bwa: Vayu. Adhyushita\xc5\x9bwa: Brahma. Vidhriti:\nBhagavata.\n\n[386:25](vp096.htm#fr_1013) Omitted: Brahma and Bhagavata.\n\n[386:26](vp096.htm#fr_1014) Omitted: Brahma and Hari V.: but included with\nsimilar particulars by the Vayu, Bhagavata, and Raghu Van\xc5\x9ba: see also p. 283,\nwhere Kau\xc5\x9balya is likewise given as the synonyme of Hiran\xcc\x81yagarbha, being, as\nthe commentator observes, his Visheshan\xcc\x81am, his epithet or attribute, born p.\n387 in, or king of, Ko\xc5\x9bala. The Vayu accordingly terms him ###, but in the\nBhagavata the epithet Kau\xc5\x9balya is referred by the commentator to Yajnawalkya,\nthe pupil of Hiran\xcc\x81yanabha. The author of the Raghu Van\xc5\x9ba, not understanding\nthe meaning of the term, has converted Kau\xc5\x9balya into the son of Hiran\xcc\x81yanabha.\nRaghu V. 18. 27. The Bhagavata, like our text, calls the prince the pupil of\nJaimini. The Vayu, more correctly, \'the pupil of the sage\'s grandson.\' There\nseems to be, however, something unusual in the account given of the relation\nborne by the individuals named to each other. As a pupil of Jaimini,\nHiran\xcc\x81yanabha is a teacher of the Sama-veda (see [p.\n283](vp080.htm#page_283)), but Yajnawalkya is the teacher of the Vajasaneyi\nbranch of the Yajush ([p. 281](vp079.htm#page_281)). Neither of them is\nspecified by Mr. Colebrooke amongst the authorities of the Patanjala or Yoga\nphilosophy; nor does either appear as a disciple of Jaimini in his character\nof founder of the Mimansa school. Trans. R. As. Soc. vol. I.\n\n[387:27](vp096.htm#fr_1015) Arthasiddhi: Brahma P. and Hari V.\n\n[387:28](vp096.htm#fr_1016) Maruta: Brahma P. and Hari V. These authorities\nomit the succeeding four names.\n\n[387:29](vp096.htm#fr_1017) Sahaswat: Vayu.\n\n[387:30](vp096.htm#fr_1018) Vi\xc5\x9bwasaha: Bhagavata.\n\n[387:31](vp096.htm#fr_1019) The list closes here, as the author of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as, Vyasa, is cotemporary with the great war. The line of Ikshwaku is\nresumed prophetically in the twenty-second chapter.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V](vp097.htm)\n\n'
