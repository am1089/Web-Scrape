Up he raised  \nHis awful head with eyes that blazed  \nLike comets, dire as Death in form  \nWho threats the worlds with fire and stcrm.  \nThe giants pointed to their stores  \nOf buffaloes and deer and boars,  \nAnd straight he gorged him with a flood  \nOf wine, with marrow, flesh, and blood.  \nHe ceased: the giants ventured near  \nAnd bent their lowly heads in fear.  \nThen Kumbhakarna glared with eyes  \nStill heavy in their first surprise,  \nStill drowsy from his troubled rest,  \nAnd thus the giant band addressed.  \n'How have ye dared my sleep to break?  \nNo trifling cause should bid me wake.  \nSay, is all well? or tell the need  \nThat drives you with unruly speed  \nTo wake me. Mark the words I say,  \nThe king shall tremble in dismay,  \n\np. 472  \n\nOf Vishn'u, he was firm in heart.  \n   The Wind-God's son the fight beheld,  \nAnd rushed at Ravan, rage-impelled.  \nDown crashed his mighty hand the foe  \nFull in the chest received the blow.  \nHis eyes grew dim, his knees gave way.  \nAnd senseless on the earth he lay.  \n   The Wind-God's son to Rama bore  \nDeep-wounded Lakshman stained with gore.  \nHe whom no foe might lift or bend  \nWas light as air to such a friend.  \nThe dart that Lakshman's side had cleft,  \nUntouched, the hero's body left,  \nAnd flashing through the air afar  \nResumed its place in Ravan's car;  \nAnd, waxing well though wounded sore,  \nHe felt the deadly pain no more.  \nAnd Ravan, though with deep wounds pained,  \nSlowly his sense and strength regained,  \nAnd furious still and undismayed  \nOn bow and shaft his hand he laid.  \n   Then Hanuman to Rama cried:  \n'Ascend my back, great chief, and ride  \nLike Vishnu borne on Garud's wing,  \nTo battle with the giant king.'  \nSo, burning for the dire attack,  \nRode Rama on the Vanar's back,  \nAnd with fierce accents loud and slow  \nThus gave defiance to the foe,  \nWhile his strained bowstring made a sound  \nLike thunder when it shakes the ground:  \n'Stay, Monarch of the giants, stay,  \nThe penalty of sin to pay.  \nStay; whither wilt thou fly, and how  \nEscape the death that waits thee now?'  \n   No word the giant king returned:  \nHis eyes with flames of fury burned.  \nHis arm was stretched, his bow was bent,  \nAnd swift his fiery shafts were sent.  \nRed torrents from the Vanar flowed:  \nThen Rama near to Ravan' strode,  \nAnd, with keen darts that never failed,  \nThe chariot of the king assailed.  \nWith surest aim his arrows flew:  \nThe driver and the steeds he slew,  \nAnd shattered with the pointed steel  \nCar, flag and pole and yoke and wheel.  \nAs Indra hurls his bolt to smite  \nMount Meru's heaven-ascending height,  \nSo Rama with a flaming dart  \nStruck Lanka's monarch near the heart,  \nWho reeled and fell beneath the blow  \nAnd from loose fingers dropped his bow.  \nBright as the sun, with crescent head,  \nFrom Rama's bow an arrow sped,  \nAnd from his forehead, proud no more,  \nCleft the bright coronet he wore.  \n\nThen Rama stood by Ravan''s side  \nAnd to the conquered giant cried:  \n'Well hast thou fought: thine arm has slain  \nStrong heroes of the Vanar train.  \nI will not strike or slay thee now,  \nFor weary, faint with fight art thou.  \nTo Lanka's town thy footsteps bend,  \nAnd there the night securely spend.  \nTo-morrow come with car and bow,  \nAnd then my prowess shall thou know.'  \n   He ceased: the king in humbled pride  \nRose from the earth and naught replied.  \nWith wounded limbs and shattered crown  \nHe sought again his royal town.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[470:1](ry455.htm#fr_976) An ancient king of Ayodhya said by some to have been\nPrithu's father.\n\n[470:2](ry455.htm#fr_977) The daughter of King Kus'adhwaja.
