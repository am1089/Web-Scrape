Then he makes her step forward in a northern direction seven steps (with\nthe words),\n\n'One for sap, two for juice, three for the prospering of wealth, four for\ncomfort, five for cattle, six for the seasons. Friend! be with seven steps\n(united to me). So be thou devoted to me.'\n\np. 284\n\n2\\. (The words), 'May Vish _n_ u lead thee' are added to every part (of the\nformula).\n\n3 3. From the moment of their going away a man who holds a water-pot on his\nshoulder, stands silent to the south of the fire;\n\n4\\. To the north, (according to the opinion) of some (teachers).\n\n5\\. From that (pot) he sprinkles her (with water) on her head (with the\nformula),\n\n'The blessed, the most blessed waters, the peaceful ones, the most peaceful\nones, may they give medicine to thee'\xc2\x97\n\n6\\. And with the three (verses), Ye waters are' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XI, 50-52).\n\n7\\. He then makes her look at the sun with (the verse), 'That eye' (Va _g_. Sa\n_m_ h. XXXVI, 24.).\n\n8 8. He then touches her heart, (reaching) over her right shoulder, with (the\nwords), 'Into my will I take thy heart; thy mind shall follow my mind; in my\nword thou shalt rejoice with all thy heart; may Pra _g_ apati join thee to\nme.'\n\n9 9. He then recites over her (the verse), 'Auspicious ornaments does this\nwoman wear. Come up to her and behold her. Having brought luck to her, go away\nback to your houses.'\n\n10 10. A strong man snatches her up from the\n\np. 285\n\nground, and sets her down in an eastern or northern direction in an out-of-\nthe-way house, on a red bull's hide, with (the words),\n\n'Here may the cows sit down, here the horses, here the men. Here may sacrifice\nwith a thousand gifts, here may Pushan sit down.'\n\n11\\. And what (the people in) the village tell them, that they should do.\n\n12 12. For it is said, 'At weddings and funerals he shall enter the village;'\n\n13\\. (And) because the _S_ ruti says, 'Therefore on these two occasions\nauthority rests with the village.'\n\n14\\. To the teacher (who helps at the wedding ceremonies) he gives an optional\ngift.\n\n15 15-17. A cow is the optional gift to be given by a Brahma _n_ a,\n\n16\\. A village by a Ra _g_ anya,\n\n17\\. A horse by a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n18 18. A hundred (cows) with a chariot (he gives to a father) who has only\ndaughters.\n\n19 19. After sunset he shows her the firm star (i.e. the polar-star) with (the\nwords),\n\n'Firm art thou; I see thee, the firm one. Firm be thou with me, O thriving\none!\n\np. 286\n\n'To me B _ri_ haspati has given thee; obtaining offspring through me, thy\nhusband, live with me a hundred autumns.'\n\n20\\. If she does not see (the polar-star), let her say notwithstanding, 'I\nsee,' &c.\n\n21 21. Through a period of three nights they shall eat no saline food; they\nshall sleep on the ground; through one year they shall refrain from conjugal\nintercourse, or through a period of twelve nights, or of six nights, or at\nleast of three nights.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[283:1](sbe29162.htm#fr_710) 8, 1. The parallel texts have sakha and saptapadi\nfor sakhe and saptapada of Paraskara.\n\n[284:3](sbe29162.htm#fr_711) See above, I, 4, 15.

Could\nthis possibly be a rule for Vanaprasthas who live in the forest and enter the\nvillage only on exceptional occasions?\n\n[285:15-17](sbe29162.htm#fr_716) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 14, 13 seqq.\n\n[285:18](sbe29162.htm#fr_717) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 14, 16. Comp. the note there.\n\n[285:19](sbe29162.htm#fr_718) In the text the word 'firm' (dhruva) is neuter\nin the two first instances, and refers to the 'firm star;' the third time it\nis feminine, referring to the bride. Paraskara has the vocative poshye for the\nnominative poshya of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 17, 3; comp. above, \xc2\xa7 1 sakhe for sakha.\n\n[286:21](sbe29162.htm#fr_719) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 17, 5. 6; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 8,\n10. 11.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 9](sbe29163.htm)\n\n"
