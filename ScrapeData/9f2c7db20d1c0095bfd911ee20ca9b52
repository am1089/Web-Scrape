That (brick) which\ncontains the Triv _ri_ t (thrice-threefold stoma) he places in front, that\ncontaining the twenty-one-fold (stoma) at the back, that containing the\nfifteenfold (stoma) on the right (south) side, that containing the\nseventeenfold (stoma) on the left (north) side.\n\n8:4:4:22\\. Now when the one containing the Triv _ri_ t had been laid down,\nDeath lay in wait for Pra _g_ apati in the one (on the south side) containing\nthe fifteenfold (stoma), thinking, 'After that he will lay down this one: I\nwill here seize upon him!' He (Pra _g_ apati) was aware of him, and having\nseen him, he walked round and laid down (at the back) the (brick) containing\nthe twenty-one-fold (stoma). Death came thither, and he (Pra _g_ apati) laid\ndown the one (on the south side) containing the fifteenfold (stoma). Death\ncame to the fifteenfold one, and he (Pra _g_ apati) laid down the one (on the\nnorth side) containing the seventeenfold (stoma). It was here 1 that he put\ndown and confounded Death; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now put down\nand confound all evils\n\np. 78\n\n8:4:4:33\\. Then as to the subsequent (bricks). Alongside of the one (in front)\ncontaining the Triv _ri_ t he lays down one containing the Triv _ri_ t;\nalongside of that (at the back) containing the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a (he lays down)\none containing the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a; alongside of that (on the south, or right,\nside) containing the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a (he lays down) one containing the\nSaptada _s_ a; alongside of that (on the north, or left, side) containing the\nSaptada _s_ a (he lays down) one containing the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a. And\nbecause he thus changes in laying them down 1, therefore they (the bricks) are\nof diverse stomas; and because these stomas are then otherwise with regard to\nthe former ones 2, therefore also they (the bricks) are of diverse stomas. And\nin this way the gods laid them down, and otherwise the Asuras; whereupon the\ngods succeeded, and the Asuras came to naught: he who knows this, succeeds of\nhimself, and his hateful enemy comes to naught.\n\n8:4:4:44\\. Now, this Agni (fire-altar) is an animal, and he is made up\n(restored) here whole and entire. His head is the two (bricks) containing the\nTriv _ri_ t; and as to why these two are such as contain the Triv _ri_ t,--the\nhead is threefold (triv _ri_ t). There are two of them, because the head\nconsists of two bones (kapala). He lays them down in front, for this head is\nin the front (of the animal).\n\n8:4:4:55\\. The two (behind) containing the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a are the foundation\n(the feet). And as to why these are such as contain the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a,--the\nEkavi _m_ _s_ a is\n\np. 79\n\na foundation. There are two of them,--because the foundation is a pair (of\nfeet). He places them behind, because this foundation (the hind-feet) is\nbehind.\n\n8:4:4:66\\. The two containing the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a 1 are the arms (or\nfore-feet). And as to why these are such as contain the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a,\n--the arms are fifteenfold. There are two of them, because these arms are two.\nHe places them on the sides, because these two arms are at the sides.\n\n8:4:4:77\\. The two containing the Saptada _s_ a are food. And as to why they\nare such as contain the Saptada _s_ a,--food is seventeenfold. There are two\nof them, because 'anna' (food) has two syllables. He lays them down close to\nthose containing the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a he thus puts the food close to the\narms. Those containing the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a are on the outside, and those\ncontaining the Saptada _s_ a on the inside: he thus encloses the food on both\nsides by the arms.\n\n8:4:4:88\\. And those he places in the middle are the body (trunk). He places\nthem on the range of the Reta _h_ si _k_ (bricks), for--the Reta _h_ si _k_\nbeing the ribs, and the ribs being the middle (of the body)--this body is in\nthe middle (of the limbs) 2. He places them in every direction, for this body\n(extends) in every direction. And as to what other (space) there is besides\nthis, that is left over;--and what is left over for the gods, that is these\nmetres;--and as to these\n\np. 80\n\nmetres, they are cattle;--and as to cattle, they are (objects of) good\nfortune;--and as to these (objects of) good fortune, they are yonder sun: he\nis that one to the south of them.\n\n8:4:4:99\\. Now some lay down these (rows of bricks 1) immediately after the\ntwo containing the Triv _ri_ t, saying, 'They are the tongue and the jaws:\nthose fourteen are the jaws, and those six are the tongue.' Let him not do so:\nthey cause a redundancy,--it would be just as if one were to put two other\njaws to the already existing jaws, as if one were to put another tongue to the\nalready existing tongue. That (brick) wherein the head is indeed (includes)\nthe jaws and the tongue.\n\n8:4:4:1010\\. Now some lay down (these bricks) in the intermediate (south-\neastern) space of it (the altar) 2, saying, 'This is the sun: we thus place\nyonder sun in that direction.' Let him not do so: surely there are those other\nrites 3 by which he places him in that (direction).\n\n8:4:4:1111\\. Some, again, lay them down on the right\n\np. 81\n\n[paragraph continues] (south 1) side, saying, 'We thus place these signs of\ngood fortune (pu _n_ ya lakshmi) on the right side:' whence he who has a mark\n2 (lakshman) on his right side is said to have good luck (pu _n_ ya-\nlakshmika), and on the left side in the case of a woman 3; for the woman has\nher position on the left side (of the man): therefore it is done thus. But let\nhim place them in front; for where the head is there are also the jaws and the\ntongue: and thus he places the signs of good fortune at the head (or, in the\nmouth, mukhata _h_ ), whence they say that he who has a (peculiar) mark in his\nmouth 4 has good luck.\n\n8:4:4:1212\\. This, indeed, is Brahman's layer: inasmuch as they (the gods)\nlaid down the Brahman 5, therefore it is Brahman's layer. It is Pra _g_\napati's layer: inasmuch as they laid down Pra _g_ apati 6, it is Pra _g_\napati's layer. It is the _Ri_ shis' layer: inasmuch as they laid down the _Ri_\nshis 7, it is the _Ri_ shis' layer. It is Vayu's layer: inasmuch as they laid\ndown Vayu 8, it is Vayu's layer. It is the Stomas' layer: inasmuch as they\nlaid down the hymn-forms 9, it is the Stomas'\n\np. 82\n\nlayer. It is the layer of the vital airs: inasmuch as they laid down the vital\nairs 1, it is the layer of the vital airs. Hence, whatsoever one may know,\nthat comes to be included in the ancestry, in the kinship 2 of this layer.--He\nthen lays down two Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as (space-filling bricks) in that corner 3:\nthe significance of these (will be explained) farther on 4. He throws loose\nsoil thereon: the significance of this (will be explained) farther on 5.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[77:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_147) That is, in the laying down of these bricks. For\nthe order followed in laying down the bricks, see also [p.\n67](sbe4316.htm#page_67), note [2](sbe4316.htm#fn_139).\n\n[78:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_148) The Sanskrit text, as usual, makes our gerundial\nclause the principal clause: 'because he lays them down in changing them.'\n\n[78:2](sbe4318.htm#fr_149) On the south side a Sp _ri_ t representing the\nSaptada _s_ a is placed immediately north of a stoma (brick) representing the\nPa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a; and vice versa on the north (left) side.\n\n[79:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_150) Viz. the southern one of the two on the south\n(right) side, and the northern one of the two on the north (left) side.\n\n[79:2](sbe4318.htm#fr_151) Atha ya madhya npadadhati sa atma, ta reta _h_ si\n_k_ or velayopadadhati--p _ri_ sh _t_ ayo vai reta _h_ si _k_ au, madhyam u p\n_ri_ shtayo--madhyato hy ayam atma.--Here the two clauses with 'vai' are\ninserted to substantiate the reason introduced by 'hi.'\n\n[80:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_152) Viz. the row of fourteen bricks lying behind the\ntwo front bricks, and the row of six bricks again placed behind these. It will\nhe remembered that only the northern one of the two front bricks was laid down\nat first, and that then three others were placed in the different directions,\nafter which the row of fourteen was laid down behind the front one; and\nsimilarly the laying down of the second front brick was separated from that of\nthe second row by the laying down of three other bricks in the different\nquarters.\n\n[80:2](sbe4318.htm#fr_153) In that case, the two shank-sized bricks are laid\ndown in the south-east corner, and the rows of smaller bricks are placed to\nthe north of them. See Katy. _S_ rautas. XIV, I0, 4.\n\n[80:3](sbe4318.htm#fr_154) See, for instance, VI, 7, 3, 9 where the Ukhya\nAgni, representing the sun, is held up by the Agni _k_ it (sacrificer) in the\nsouth-easterly direction. The south-east corner is sacred to Agni.\n\n[81:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_155) In that case, they are laid down north of the two\nbricks lying on the southern end of the cross-spine, first the row of\nfourteen, and then, north of these, the row of six.\n\n[81:2](sbe4318.htm#fr_156) Yasya dakshi _n_ apar _s_ ve laksha _n_ a _m_\nkayasya va var _n_ e va ki _m_ taratmaka _m_ (?) bhavati; comm.\n\n[81:3](sbe4318.htm#fr_157) This clause is rather abrupt, and is, moreover,\nhardly logical. It is not clear whether it is the two southern bricks that are\ncompared with the woman, or the bricks to be placed alongside of them on the\nnorth (left) side.\n\n[81:4](sbe4318.htm#fr_158) Viz. such as an excess of sharp teeth\n(incisors)--yasya mukhalaksha _n_ a _m_ dakshi _n_ ada _m_ sh _t_ ratirekadi\nbhavati; comm.\n\n[81:5](sbe4318.htm#fr_159) See [VIII, 4, 1, 3](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:3).\n\n[81:6](sbe4318.htm#fr_160) See [VIII, 4, 1, 4](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:4).\n\n[81:7](sbe4318.htm#fr_161) See [VIII, 4, 1, 5](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:5).\n\n[81:8](sbe4318.htm#fr_162) See [VIII, 4, 1, 8](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:8).\n\n[81:9](sbe4318.htm#fr_163) See [VIII, 4, 1, 4](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:4) seq.\n\n[82:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_164) See [VIII, 4, 1, 5](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:5).\n\n[82:2](sbe4318.htm#fr_165) Or, in the (symbolic) meaning. The literal reading\nof the clause is,--'Thereby this layer of his becomes possessed of an ancestry\nand kinship (or mystic sense).'\n\n[82:3](sbe4318.htm#fr_166) Viz. in the north-east corner, or on the left\nshoulder, whence, in two turns, the available spaces of the altar are filled\nup. In laying down the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as of the first three layers he started\nfrom the south-east, the south-west, and the north-west corners respectively.\nCf. [p. 22](sbe4306.htm#page_22), note [1](sbe4307.htm#fn_73); [p.\n41](sbe4310.htm#page_41), note [1](sbe4310.htm#fn_94); [p.\n58](sbe4314.htm#page_58), note [1](sbe4314.htm#fn_127).\n\n[82:4](sbe4318.htm#fr_167) See [VIII, 7, 2, 4](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:4) seq.\n\n[82:5](sbe4318.htm#fr_168) See [VIII, 7, 3, 1](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:1) seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 5, 1.
