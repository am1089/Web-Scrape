How can that death be\nslain that thus slay Siva? (a very difficult grammatical construction to\ntranslate).\n\np. 264\n\n1101\n\nYou may straighten a tree to prevent its being crooked. You may duly rectify\nstone but you cannot straighten the mind that it become not more crooked.\n\n1102\n\nWhatever any one at any time advises, a man should listen to respectfully nor\nbe hasty. After learning the truth he will become a steady character.\n\n1103\n\nWhen their crimes fall on their head, they think of God. When they(fall with\ntheir heads under) live headlessly they think not on God. Like sinners do they\nmake a noise as if in (or seeing) a dream, See they this? O Vema.\n\n1104\n\nWords are produced by the thousand (let bags of wards come); yet by well\nweighing words, they become magic gems. By knowing the\n[composition](errata.htm#193) of words, thou with thy words gain perfection O,\nVema!\n\np. 265\n\n1105\n\nThe mind is of tender age itself. The mind is still youth in all men. Mind\nwitnesses to mind. No decrepitude affects the minds in the world, O Vema!\n\n1106\n\nThough you have gained wealth you may not have got liberality. The wisdom of\nBrahma Deva is the [wisdom](errata.htm#194) of a fool (lit. slave). He gives\nwealth here and liberality there.\n\n1107\n\nLooking and looking at himself he cannot perceive thee, O God. Looking and\nlooking at thee he would forget himself. He that sees thee is the true saint.\n\n1108\n\nThe water poured at the root rises around the root and greatly increases the\nentire tree. In the same manner the soul pervades the entire body.\n\n1109\n\np. 267\n\nSurely the Vedas are all mere contention. Let ashes fill the contentious man\'s\nmouth; surely the vanquisher of the Vedas is Vemana. Surely it is our great\nobject to know what is true happiness.\n\n1110\n\nIf thou plant a tree carefully but give it no trellis, it will not grow but\nperish in this world. Thus [it](errata.htm#195) is with him who desireth\nwisdom but can obtain no teacher.\n\n1111\n\nShall not we cut down the forest of ignorance with the sword of knowledge? Let\nus not think on ignorance in our mind but look to the places where the light\nof wisdom is fixed!\n\n1112\n\nAlas none knows intuition (yeriki for everiki). Though thou teach none can\nunderstand; by teaching and teaching understanding is produced. Excellent (or\ndivine) is understanding if thou will view it.\n\n1113\n\np. 267\n\nLike as the (Parabhruta) cuckoo is reared by the crow, like as the worm comes\nto life by means of the wasp, thus is it that the fool pretends to be a\nteacher but cannot bestow perfection (moksha). The nature of the pupil does\nnot depend on the teacher.\n\n1114\n\nIf you take a vile fellow and give him wealth he will overthrow even the\nvenerable. [Does](errata.htm#196) the dog that gnaws shoes know the sweetness\nof the sugar cane?\n\n1115\n\nBeasts will not beg of beasts; the race of birds will not submissively ask of\ntheir equals. Is he a man who will not bestow when a man asks or is he a woman\nin the world, O Vema!\n\n1116\n\nWhat though you have got a _putti_ (1600 lbs) or only a cupful of chaff. There\nis not in it one grain in the world. Trouble only increases in proportion to\nthe store of empty words. The more talk the more trouble.\n\n1117\n\nBy want of food they are in distress. How should the wisdom of such mere\ncorpses become fruitless? If you pour water into an unbaked vessel will it\nremain there in?\n\np. 268\n\n1118\n\nHe was born in this land and grew up in this land but cannot bestow this land\non any one. Alas the man of a foreign country is the king of the world.\n(Probably alludes to the Musalman Government.)\n\n1119\n\nWhy should all wisdom be published? Why should we receive the gifts of a\nsinner, O sage, ignorantly.\n\n1120\n\nHe that quitteth not a faithless friend--is he not a shepherd? (swain fool)\nHas any shepherd in the world horns (i.e. honour)?\n\n1121\n\nWhat has a thief to do with good habits? What has a fornicator to do with\nworship and adoration? What in the world has a palmwine drinker to do with\ndevotion?\n\n1122\n\nThis unstable body falls about like a dog; for many days chatters, he gives\nhis body to the fire or to the jackals of the forest.\n\np. 269\n\n1123\n\nYour wife is the property of others. Your wealth is the property of the\nwhores. Your body is the property of earth. If you consider them in \'your\nmind, the virtue (i.e. practice) alone is yours.\n\n1124\n\nIf with thy whole heart thou seek and see that, think that it is of wondrous\nsemblance; then shalt thou perceive that it pervades all space and is not of\nnature divisible.\n\n1125\n\nHow should he who is attached to (desires) sin think of the deity. How should\nthe sinner be a teacher? Behold the mind of a fool. Does it know (Had) God?\n\n1126\n\nTo cleanse his mouth is a great trouble (nastiness) even to the great saint.\nNot even a son of Brahma can [purify](errata.htm#197) his mouth, But the mouth\nthat speaks the truth is the purest in the world.\n\n1127\n\np. 270\n\nFirst it rises above the water and becomes a sprout; the sprout is itself both\nhusband and son of the earth. The earth is the seed, to both mother and wife\n\n1128\n\nWho are the kings who always being engaged in the earth nourish the world?\nWhence does the title of great Lord attach to man?\n\n1129\n\nIn former time in the world a Boya man, when a tiger roared in the forests,\nheld it to be a cruel beast, and slew it. The sin that he incurred hereby\nseized the Boysa and whelmed him.\n\n1130\n\nFrom their birth they continually slay all animals, and become the garden bed\nof sin. Shall beatitude be attained by evil doers?\n\n1131\n\nAnimals that have tails, they get and cut their throats, they break the necks\nof all the goats of the flocks and as for the rest of the animals they burn\nand eat them.\n\np. 271\n\n1132\n\nThey will quit all tasks whatever and the men of the world long (lit. dwell)\nfor the taste of the mouth (eloquence). If you say Devil, the girls are\nalarmed; [all](errata.htm#198) the world has become thus. O Vera I look well\nto thy words.\n\n1133\n\nLook at your wife. She is shackles on your leg. All your children (in a row)\nare the rivets. All connections are like to a prison as you consider them\nclosely.\n\n1134\n\nHe himself remain sunk in the ocean of love formed by the triple love of wife,\noffspring and wealth. In what way then should men be able to attain beatitude.\nWhen the song is ended we obtain the symphony.\n\n1135\n\nThrough those desires that have been wound about us ever since we were\nchildren-thus high are we entrapped by the names of relations, called younger\nsister, elder sister, mother and father.\n\np. 272\n\n1136\n\nHow many are thy mothers and fathers? How many births hast thou had? Again how\nmany are the places where thou sufferest pain (or live)? The fool knoweth not,\nthis is stable and this fluctuating.\n\n1137\n\nThat cannot perceive that life is unstable, thus mad men. They are puffed up\nhere in the earth. All souls are surely in the sight of Yama like as goats\nbound for sacrifice.\n\n1138\n\nWhen your father and mother are dead, you and your wife unite and look to\nbuilding your house agreeably. Like as though a thief already fixed on the\nimpaling post should ask for food.\n\n1139\n\nIncrease are decrease, consider, occur to all, however great. The body is not\nreal, if you think on the facts. They cannot know this. What can we say to\nthis.\n\n1140\n\np. 273\n\nThrough a selfish spirit it is that we say of any one thing, I cannot live (or\nget on) without this. To have it, but to know you cannot perceive it, go to.\nThis is the bond of the worldly life.\n\n1141\n\nWhat though we learn and know whence we came and where we go; it is but like\nthe coming or going [of](errata.htm#199) sleep. The birth and departure of the\nsoul, these behold, form the divine state and are alone of importance.\n\n1142\n\nAll men are bound in the cords of their lusts, shining in their dignity. They\ncannot sever it with the sword of wisdom.\n\n1143\n\nWho are ye that ye should be able to walk independently of the endless course\nof time. Relinquish all your idiotic properties and walk, O men in the paths\nof beatitude.\n\n1144\n\nWhat has become of all the noble race that lived of all? They might have\nexalted them in the world. To crush their enemies none has prevailed besides\nSiva.\n\np. 274\n\n1145\n\nThings that are produced from earth we separate from earth and dress them\nagain in an earthen vessel; at what strong love we feel for the earthen\nvessel?\n\n1146\n\nVegetables without salt are to the taste vile as (salt ground) barren land. A\nruined wretch is he that hath no shoes and the man out of debt is the richest\nof the wealthy.\n\n1147\n\nThe egg in the womb dwells in the body. By the course of breath it pleasantly\nrambles. This is like austerity in a vine-yard (under a palm tree). When shall\nhe attain bliss.\n\n1148\n\nHow is instruction gained? He cannot see the top of his head. It is good to\nseek him, the deity who dwells on the top of your head. That skilful man who\ncomprehends his head, takes beatitude by violence.\n\n1149\n\nIn truth, worth is the source of a faithful intention; devoid of faith thou\nshalt not attain bliss. What is this we call bliss? Thou art thyself its\norigin.\n\np. 275\n\n1150\n\nFormerly _Boya_ Kannappa drew near to the three-eyed god and became beatified.\nPurity of heart is the root of all acceptable worship.\n\n1151\n\nTime is the effective form of Siva. Time is the [duration](errata.htm#200) of\nGod. How shalt a fool know the meaning of true happiness?\n\n1152\n\nBy means of a name, a country becomes a holy ground. Thus have stones, through\nnames become kings (i.e., idols). By names have water become all holy streams.\n\n1153\n\nFor garden herbs, for spontaneous vegetables, for bran and for empty ears (of\ncorn), those jack asses who for such boons as these have written poems and\nhave become as great as the truly [excellent](errata.htm#201).\n\n1154\n\nWhen we were born in the womb of our mother at first we not clothing nor shall\nhave at our latter end. Is not it then a joke for us to wear clothing in our\nintermediate life?\n\np. 276\n\n1152\n\nThere is no artist in the land nobler than the creator. Draw near with delight\nto him the lord of all; who is greater than that artist; are men to revile the\ncreator.\n\n1156\n\nIf he knows not how to restrain his five senses, and cannot (hold) check the\nflame of the fire within, and if he has not singleness of heart how shall he\nregenerate?\n\n1157\n\nHe considereth himself the teacher of all the tribes (castes) but knoweth not\ndeath, this son of a pariar, when this teacher dies he is vile as the crow\nthat never had a teacher.\n\n1158\n\nHe that cannot restrain his mind is in his soul even lower than a pariar,\nafter death hell shall be his fate. O men!\n\n1159\n\nIs not it wrong to call that man living soul who can perceive no beauty in the\ndeity Where is the linga? Where is the Zangam? (i.e., what has such a\n[Zangam](errata.htm#202) to do with the linga).\n\np. 277\n\n1160\n\nRelinquish the degraded [commerce](errata.htm#203) of excessive sensual\ndelights (Lit. delights of the five senses) and truly become part of the\ndivine self. Let not the internal vision desire the pleasures of eyesights.\nCall not merely with thy mouth on god, O Vema!\n\n1161\n\nExternally ye suspend the lingam to a number of threads and daub yourselves\nexternally with ashes, yet cannot see that God who dwells externally in all\nspace,\n\n1162\n\nWhen God ordered the world to proceed by means of death and birth, the name of\nteacher is attached to him; false is the teacher who knoweth not that his own\ndeath is certain.\n\n1163\n\nSee these robbers call themselves teachers--void of knowledge, ignorant of\nthemselves--these unprofitable sons of slave.\n\n1164\n\np. 278\n\nThere is not a single teacher who can show us the (gurutu) truth, not one\nexcellent scholar is there who discerneth the truth. A teacher and a wise\npupil are rare as a hare\'s horns.\n\n1165\n\nSetting up a teacher in even each religion, not even one man hath attained\nbliss. They worship unblushing teachers.\n\n1166\n\nOne is born only to devour food, and perishes, another is born to attain\nbeatitude, and perishes. To attain power another becomes a pariar...\n\n1167\n\nThey talk and say there is a teacher in each sect--O ye pariars! ignorant of\nhidden truth. He that calls himself, dies a crow devoid of instructor.\n\n1168\n\nIn the evening the Brahmin performs the religious draughts. The king mounts\nthe sedan, in this earthly dwelling. The cobbler dances a jig. The disease is\nhealed by medicine.\n\n1169\n\np. 279\n\nFirst knowledge, thereby...let not the pious entertain doubts; without the\nillumination of a lamp shall darkness be dissipated?\n\n1170\n\nKnowing that the body will perish in the ground, yet through great attachment\na man nourishes it. Lo! Lo! like as if he should cut off his nee and set\nhimself to drink the blood,\n\n1171\n\nHow large this exterior may be. I know not what connection there is between\nthe divinity and this world. In the estimation of the wise how large is the\nsun, Thus musing they are evidently alarmed. (exemplification of doubt.)\n("sunt qui formidive nulla Imbuti spectent")\n\n1172\n\nIf rain raineth, the field fruiteth. If rain fall not, it is soon dried up.\nThus is the field ordained as sustenance to all.\n\n1173\n\nHe that speaketh the truth (tatwa) is to be met with some where in the earth.\nBut he who knows the truth is no where found. If he should exist, he is\ncertainly imperceptible to us.\n\np. 280\n\n1174\n\nHe who being charitable in his mind considers the hungry guest as God, and\nwithout the least heat (displeasure) gives him a mouthful (as much as a nut)\nof food, this is the man who can cry avaunt to yama (death) and slay him.\n\n1175\n\nOur connections (family) being about us and living in sweet enjoyment, in the\nmidst of them their ruler (the soul) sits. O ye men attain the dwelling of\nGod; there alone is true happiness found.\n\n1176\n\nAfter you have boiled vegetables, is it possible to pick out the straws? Sense\nwould teach you to gather them before boiling, After you have lost all you\npossessed where is charity (dharma).\n\n1177\n\nWhere trees are produced, fruits also flourish, They must be cut down (or\ngathered) with a knife. If you dress and eat them, you will know their\nquality.\n\n1178\n\np. 281\n\nWhile there is still salt and tamarind fruits in the village why dread famine,\nO farmer! Is there no orpiment? Is there no tin? (That is, I advise you to\npoison [yourselves either](errata.htm#204) with natural poisons or with\nimmoderate quantities of salt or tamarind acid).\n\n1179\n\nIf with a mouth defiled with spittle thou meditate on him, does the divinity\nthereby become spittle (in a thousand ways)? However many persons we name they\nare not thereby defiled.\n\n1180\n\nHe who in the budding of prosperity gives the gifts of a virgin (kanyadan), at\nthe last the region of holiness shall be attained by him. This is the secret\nof Vedanta.\n\n1181\n\nIf seeing one man\'s wealth and strength, and desiring his gold, thou give him\nthy daughter (kanya) heaven exists not for thee. He who favouring the poor\ngives a female to him, what is the use of talking? He is the Parama Siva.\n\n1182\n\np. 282\n\nThe dowry (or gift in marriage) which is given through seeing and desiring,\nall possessions and good things perish. A disproportioned dowry produces much\nprofits.\n\n1183\n\nAt the time when they give a daughter to a man of wealth, fools exult greatly.\nIt is merely the result of their prayers. Will your pride remain stable?\n\n1184\n\nThough he be devoid of learning, and void of money, if after all even a fool,\nor dumb, if she be grown you may give her to a favourite connection (bandhu).\n\n1185\n\nHe who takes a connection of his own and without reckoning his wealth, looks\nonly to his age bestows the dowry and thus gives his daughter (woman) in\nmarriage, this is the wisest of all.\n\n1186\n\nIf you bestow your daughter in marriage looking to wealth, it is as if you\ngaffe her for a price. The dignified way is to give her to an equal. If thou\ngive her to a poor man, they remain entwined in close attachments.\n\np. 283\n\n1187\n\nGiving one\'s daughter to a rich man is like the water of a well flowing into\nthe sea. But a woman given to a poor man is like watering a lime tree with sea\nof water,\n\n1188\n\nThrough a man\'s wealth he gets an excellent wife ( _punyavati_ ). Thus a fit\nhusband is also gained by an excellent woman. By the fortune (bhagam) of both,\nfriends and good sons and the eight blessings will be gained.\n\n1189\n\nWhen a marriage contract (manuvu) is made by a rich man with a poor one,\nwealth and poverty became thereby united. What then is possession and what is\npoverty?\n\n1190\n\nMother, father, friends and relations, and all others will seek and desire a\nyoung man. They will give him the girl but not fortune with her.\n\n1191\n\np. 284\n\nThere is no place that exists not in the mind it is closely united with our\nacts, if we meditate on God in our hearts.\n\n1192\n\nDuring his life he doth not restrain his lusts but when death comes, he turns\nrecluse. Without thou quell thy mind, is beatitude attainable?\n\n1192\n\nIf thy eye be single, the knowledge shall be one like a man in this earth is\nunited with a woman. Then shall thy interior be full of light like to the lord\nof the world.\n\n1194\n\nBorn in the dark, we grow up in the darkness. Why are we ensnared in the\n(concealment) darkness of delusion. If thou understand this darkness, this\nwhole world shall appear to thee.\n\n1195\n\nNot seeing the might of time and imagining that this present is perpetual they\nmerely weary themselves. How is it that the men of this world can never\ndiscern this noble boon, the lapse of time.\n\n1196\n\np. 285\n\nThrough worshipping the three eyed in ignorant faith, in former time, Boya\nKannappa became a sage. Did this happen through his worship? Wisdom was the\ncause.\n\n1197\n\nIf while we own the error of another we ourselves participate therein, the\nfortune we enjoy will perish. Is it not enough if water leaks out of a cracked\npot (i.e., defect is merely less obvious)? (Olla Ollam melamopraction of\npellat)\n\n1198\n\nShall the amorous, or he that is enslaved to cupidity or for wealth, or that\nis engrossed in attachment to his family or the stubborn, or he who (makes his\nface half) turns away his face, see heaven? Though these turn out of the way\nshall the words of Vemana ever fall to the ground?\n\n1199\n\nBy the spread of the passing wind, (water touched by it,) water acquires\ncoolness. There is another secret hidden near to this, if men would understand\nit (the mind is [similarly](errata.htm#205) affected by outward\n[occurrences](errata.htm#206)).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 1200-1215](vov14.htm)\n\n'
