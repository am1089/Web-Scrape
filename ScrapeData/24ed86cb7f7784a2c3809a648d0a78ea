I.\n\nInvocation. Maitreya inquires of his teacher, Para\xc5\x9bara, the origin and nature\nof the universe. Para\xc5\x9bara performs a rite to destroy the demons: reproved by\nVa\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, he desists: Pulastya appears, and bestows upon him divine\nknowledge: he repeats the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a. Vishn\xcc\x81u the origin, existence, and\nend of all things.\n\nOM! GLORY TO V\xc3\x81SUDEVA 1.--Victory be to thee, Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arikaksha;\n\np. 2\n\nadoration be to thee, Viswabhavana; glory be to thee, Hrishike\xc5\x9ba, Mahapurusha,\nand Purvaja 2.\n\nMay that Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is the existent, imperishable, Brahma, who is \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara 3,\nwho is spirit 4; who with the three qualities 5 is the cause of creation,\npreservation, and destruction; who is the parent of nature, intellect, and the\nother ingredients of the universe 6; be to us the bestower of understanding,\nwealth, and final emancipation.\n\np. 3\n\nHaving adored Vishn\xcc\x81u 7, the lord of all, and paid reverence to Brahma and the\nrest 8; having also saluted the spiritual preceptor 9; I will narrate a\nPuran\xcc\x81a equal in sanctity to the Vedas.\n\nMaitreya 10, having saluted him reverentially, thus addressed Para\xc5\x9bara, the\nexcellent sage, the grandson of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, who was versed in traditional\nhistory, and the Puran\xcc\x81as; who was acquainted with the Vedas, and the branches\nof science dependent upon them; and skilled in law and philosophy; and who had\nperformed the morning rites of devotion.\n\nMaitreya said, Master! I have been instructed by you in the whole of the\nVedas, and in the institutes of law and of sacred science: through your\nfavour, other men, even though they be my foes, cannot accuse me of having\nbeen remiss in the acquirement of knowledge. I am now desirous, oh thou who\nart profound in piety! to hear from thee, how this world was, and how in\nfuture it will be? what is its substance, oh Brahman, and whence proceeded\nanimate and inanimate things? into what has it been resolved, and into what\nwill its dissolution again occur? how were the elements manifested? whence\nproceeded the gods and other beings? what are the situation and extent of the\noceans and the\n\np. 4\n\nmountains, the earth, the sun, and the planets? what are the families of the\ngods and others, the Menus, the periods called Manwantaras, those termed\nKalpas, and their subdivisions, and the four ages: the events that happen at\nthe close of a Kalpa, and the terminations of the several ages 11: the\nhistories, oh great Muni, of the gods, the sages, and kings; and how the Vedas\nwere divided into branches (or schools), after they had been arranged by\nVyasa: the duties of the Brahmans, and the other tribes, as well as of those\nwho pass through the different orders of life? All these things I wish to hear\nfrom you, grandson of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. Incline thy thoughts benevolently towards\nme, that I may, through thy favour, be informed of all I desire to know.\n\nPara\xc5\x9bara replied, Well inquired, pious Maitreya. You recall to my recollection\nthat which was of old narrated by my father\'s father, Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. I had heard\nthat my father had been devoured by a Rakshas employed by Viswamitra: violent\nanger seized me, and I commenced a sacrifice for the destruction of the\nRakshasas: hundreds of them were reduced to ashes by the rite, when, as they\nwere about to be entirely extirpated, my grandfather Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha thus spake to\nme: Enough, my child; let thy wrath be appeased: the Rakshasas are not\nculpable: thy father\'s death was the work of destiny. Anger is the passion of\nfools; it becometh not a wise man. By whom, it may be asked, is any one\nkilled? Every man reaps the consequences of his own acts. Anger, my son, is\nthe destruction of all that man obtains by arduous exertions, of fame, and of\ndevout austerities; and prevents the attainment of heaven or of emancipation.\nThe chief sages always shun wrath: he not thou, my child, subject to its\ninfluence. Let no more of these unoffending spirits of darkness be consumed.\nMercy is the might of the righteous 12.\n\np. 5\n\nBeing thus admonished by my venerable grandsire, I immediately desisted from\nthe rite, in obedience to his injunctions, and Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, the most excellent\nof sages, was content with me. Then arrived Pulastya, the son of Brahma 13,\nwho was received by my grandfather with the customary marks of respect. The\nillustrious brother of Pulaha said to me; Since, in the violence of animosity,\nyou have listened to the words of your progenitor, and have exercised\nclemency, therefore you shall become learned in every science: since you have\nforborne, even though incensed, to destroy my posterity, I will bestow upon\nyou another boon, and, you shall become the author of a summary of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as 14; you shall know\n\np. 6\n\nthe true nature of the deities, as it really is; and, whether engaged in\nreligious rites, or abstaining from their performance 15, your understanding,\nthrough my favour, shall be perfect, and exempt from). doubts. Then my\ngrandsire Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha added; Whatever has been said to thee by Pulastya, shall\nassuredly come to pass.\n\nNow truly all that was told me formerly by Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, and by the wise\nPalastya, has been brought to my recollection by your questions, and I will\nrelate to you the whole, even all you have asked. Listen to the complete\ncompendium of the Pur pas, according to its tenour. The world was produced\nfrom Vishn\xcc\x81u: it exists in him: he is the cause of its continuance and\ncessation: he is the world 16.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](vp035.htm#fr_98) An address of this kind, to one or other Hindu\ndivinity, usually introduces Sanscrit compositions, especially those\nconsidered sacred. The first term of this mantra or brief prayer, Om or\nOmkara, is well known as a combination of letters invested by Hindu mysticism\nwith peculiar sanctity. In the Vedas it is said to comprehend all the gods;\nand in the Puran\xcc\x81as it is directed to be prefixed to all such formulae as that\nof the text. Thus in the Uttara Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Padma Puran\xcc\x81a: \'The syllable\nOm, the mysterious name, or Brahma, is the leader of all prayers: let it\ntherefore, O lovely-faced, (\xc5\x9aiva addresses Durga,) be employed in the\nbeginning of all prayers:\' According to the same authority, one of the\nmystical imports of the term is the collective enunciation of Vishn\xcc\x81u\nexpressed by A, of Sri his bride intimated by U, and of their joint worshipper\ndesignated by M. A whole chapter of the Vayu Puran\xcc\x81a is devoted to this term.\nA text of the Vedas is there cited: \'Om, the monosyllable Brahma;\' the latter\nmeaning either the Supreme Being or the Vedas collectively, of which this\nmonosyllable is the type. It is also said to typify the three spheres of the\nworld, the three holy fires, the three steps of Vishn\xcc\x81u, &c.--Frequent\nmeditation upon it, and repetition of it, ensure release from worldly\nexistence. See also Manu, II. 76. Vasudeva, a name of Vishn\xcc\x81u or Krishn\xcc\x81a, is,\naccording to its grammatical etymology, a patronymic derivative implying son\nof Vasudeva. The Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Puran\xcc\x81as, however, devise other explanations: see\nthe next chapter, and again, b. VI. c. 5.\n\n[2:2](vp035.htm#fr_99) In this stanza occurs a series of the appellations of\nVishn\xcc\x81u: 1. Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arikaksha, having eyes like a lotus, or heart-pervading; or\nPun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arika is explained supreme glory, and Aksha imperishable: the first is\nthe most usual etymon. 2. Viswabhavana, the creator of the universe, or the\ncause of the existence of all things. 3. Hrishike\xc5\x9ba, lord of the senses. 4.\nMaha purusha, great or supreme spirit; purusha meaning that which abides or is\nquiescent in body (puri sete), 5. Purvaja, produced or appearing before\ncreation; the Orphic \xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xcf\x89\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xcf\x82. In the fifth book, c. 18, Vishn\xcc\x81u is\ndescribed by five appellations, which are considered analogous to these; or,\n1. Bhutatma, one with created things, or Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arikaksha; 2. Pradhanatma, one\nwith crude nature, or Vi\xc5\x9bwabhavana; 3. Indriyatma, one with the senses, or\nHrishike\xc5\x9ba; 4. Paramatma, supreme spirit, or Mahapurusha; and \xc3\x81tma, soul;\nliving soul, animating nature and existing before it, or Purvaja.\n\n[2:3](vp035.htm#fr_100) Brahma, in the neuter form, is abstract supreme\nspirit; and \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara is the Deity in his active nature, he who is able to do or\nleave undone, or to do any thing in any other manner than that in which it is\ndone.\n\n[2:4](vp035.htm#fr_101) Puman which is the same with Purusha, incorporated\nspirit. By this and the two preceding terms also the commentator understands\nthe text to signify that Vishn\xcc\x81u is any form of spiritual being that is\nacknowledged by different philosophical systems, or that he is the Brahma of\nthe Vedanta, the \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara of the Patanjala, and the Purusha of the Sankhya\nschool.\n\n[2:5](vp035.htm#fr_102) The three qualities, to which we shall have further\noccasion to advert, are, Satya, goodness or purity, knowledge, quiescence;\nRajas, foulness, passion, activity; and Tamas, darkness, ignorance, inertia.\n\n[2:6](vp035.htm#fr_103) Pradhanabuddhyadisu. This predicate of the Deity\ndistinguishes most of the Puran\xcc\x81as from several of the philosophical systems,\nwhich maintain, as did the earliest Grecian systems of cosmogony, the eternal\nand independent existence of the first principle of things, as nature, matter,\nor chaos. Accordingly, the commentator notices the objection. Pradhana being\nwithout beginning, it is said how can Vishn\xcc\x81u be its parent? To which he\nreplies, that this is not so, for in a period of worldly destruction\n(Pralaya), when the Creator desists from creating, nothing is generated by\nvirtue of any other energy or parent. Or, if this be not satisfactory, then\nthe text may be understood to imply that intellect (Buddhi) &c. are formed\nthrough the materiality of crude nature, or Pradhana.\n\n[3:7](vp035.htm#fr_104) Vishn\xcc\x81u is commonly derived in the Puran\xcc\x81as from the\nroot Vis, to enter, entering into, or pervading the universe, agreeably to the\ntext of the Vedas, \'Having created that (world), he then afterwards enters\ninto it;\' being, as our comment observes, undistinguished by place, time, or\nproperty. According to the Matsya P. the name alludes to his entering into the\nmundane egg: according to the Padma P., to his entering into or combining with\nPrakriti, as Purusha or spirit. In the Moksha Dharma of the Mahabharata, s.\n165, the word is derived from the root vi, signifying motion, pervasion,\nproduction, radiance; or, irregularly, from krama, to go with the particle vi,\nimplying, variously, prefixed.\n\n[3:8](vp035.htm#fr_105) Brahma and the rest is said to apply to the series of\nteachers through whom this Puran\xcc\x81a was transmitted from its first reputed\nauthor, Brahma, to its actual narrator, the sage Para\xc5\x9bara. See also b. VI. c.\n8.\n\n[3:9](vp035.htm#fr_106) The Guru, or spiritual preceptor, is said to be Kapila\nor Saraswata; the latter is included in the series of teachers of the Puran\xcc\x81a.\nPara\xc5\x9bara must be considered also as a disciple of Kapila, as a teacher of the\nSankhya philosophy.\n\n[3:10](vp035.htm#fr_107) Maitreya is the disciple of Para\xc5\x9bara, who relates the\nVishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a to him; he is also one of the chief interlocutors in the\nBhagavata, and is introduced in the Mahabharata (Vana Parva, s. 10.) as a\ngreat Rishi, or sage, who denounces Duryodhana\'s death. In the Bhagavata he is\nalso termed Kausharavi, or the son of Kusharava.\n\n[4:11](vp035.htm#fr_108) One copy reads Yuga dherma, the duties peculiar to\nthe four ages, or their characteristic properties, instead of Yuganta.\n\n[4:12](vp035.htm#fr_109) Sacrifice of Para\xc5\x9bara. The story of Para\xc5\x9bara\'s birth\nis narrated in detail in the Mahabharata (\xc3\x81di Parva, s. 176). King\nKalmashapada meeting with Sakti, the son of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, in a narrow path in a\nthicket, desired him to stand out of his way. The sage refused: on which the\nRaja beat him with his whip, and Sakti cursed him to become a Rakshas, a man-\ndevouring spirit. The Raja in this transformation killed and ate its author,\nor Sakti, together with all the other sons of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. Sakti left his wife\nAdri\xc5\x9byanti pregnant, and she gave birth to Para\xc5\x9bara, who was brought up by p.\n5 his grandfather. When he grew up, and was informed of his father\'s death, he\ninstituted a sacrifice for the destruction of all the Rakshasas; but was\ndissuaded from its completion by Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha and other sages or Atri, Pulastya,\nPulaha, and Kratu. The Mahabharata adds, that when he desisted from the rite,\nhe scattered the remaining sacrificial fire upon the northern face of the\nHimalaya mountain, where it still blazes forth at the phases of the moon,\nconsuming Rakshasas, forests, and mountains. The legend alludes possibly to\nsome transhimalayan volcano. The transformation of Kalmashapada is ascribed in\nother places to a different cause; but he is every where regarded as the\ndevourer of Sakti or Saktri, as the name also occurs. The story is told in the\nLinga Puran\xcc\x81a (Purvarddha, s. 64) in the same manner, with the addition,\nconformably to the Saiva tendency of that work, that Para\xc5\x9bara begins his\nsacrifice by propitiating Mahadeva. Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha\'s dissuasion, and Pulastya\'s\nappearance, are given in the very words of our text; and the story concludes,\n\'thus through the favour of Pulastya and of the wise Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, Para\xc5\x9bara\ncomposed the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava (Vishn\xcc\x81u) Puran\xcc\x81a, containing ten thousand stanzas,\nand being the third of the Puran\xcc\x81a compilations\' (Puran\xcc\x81asanhita). The\nBhagavata (b. III. s. 8) also alludes, though obscurely, to this legend. In\nrecapitulating the succession of the narrators of part of the Bhagavata,\nMaitreya states that this first Puran\xcc\x81a was communicated to him by his Guru\nPara\xc5\x9bara, as he had been desired by Pulastya: i. e. according to the\ncommentator, agreeably to the boon given by Pulastya to Para\xc5\x9bara, saying, You\nshall be a narrator of Puran\xcc\x81as;. The Mahabharata makes no mention of the\ncommunication of this faculty to Para\xc5\x9bara by Pulastya; and as the Bhagavata\ncould not derive this particular from that source, it here most probably\nrefers unavowedly, as the Linga does avowedly, to the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n[5:13](vp035.htm#fr_110) Pulastya, as will be presently seen, is one of the\nRishis, who were the mind-born sons of Brahma. Pulaha, who is here also named,\nis another. Pulastya is considered as the ancestor of the Rakshasas, as he is\nthe father of Visravas, the father of Ravana and his brethren. Uttara\nRamayan\xcc\x81a. Mahabharata, Vana Parva, s. 272. Padma Pur. Linga Pur. s. 63.\n\n[5:14](vp035.htm#fr_111) Puran\xcc\x81a sanhita kertta Bhavan bha p. 6 vishyati. You\nshall be a maker of the Sanhita, or compendium of the Puran\xcc\x81as, or of the\nVishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, considered as a summary or compendium of Pauranic traditions.\nIn either sense it is incompatible with the general attribution of all the\nPuran\xcc\x81as to Vyasa.\n\n[6:15](vp035.htm#fr_112) Whether performing the usual ceremonies of the\nBrahmans, or leading a life of devotion and penance, which supersedes the\nnecessity of rites and sacrifices.\n\n[6:16](vp035.htm#fr_113) These are, in fact, the brief replies to Maitreya\'s\nsix questions (p. 3), or, How was the world created? By Vishn\xcc\x81u. How will it\nbe? At the periods of dissolution it will be in Vishn\xcc\x81u. Whence proceeded\nanimate and inanimate things? From Vishn\xcc\x81u. Of what is the substance of the\nworld? Vishn\xcc\x81u. Into what has it been, and will it again he, resolved?\nVishn\xcc\x81u. He is therefore both the instrumental and material cause of the\nuniverse. \'The answer to the "whence" replies to the query as to the\ninstrumental cause: "He is the world" replies to the inquiry as to the\nmaterial cause.\' \'And by this explanation of the agency of the materiality,\n&c. of Vishn\xcc\x81u, as regards the universe, (it follows that) all will be\nproduced from, and all will repose in him.\' We have here precisely the \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xcf\x80\xe1\xbe\xb6\xce\xbd\nof the Orphic doctrines, and we might fancy that Brucker was translating a\npassage from a Puran\xcc\x81a when he describes them in these words: "Continuisse\nJovem (lege Vishnum) sive summum ortum in se omnia, omnibus ortum ex se\ndedisse, omnia ex se genuisse, et ex sua produxisse essentia. Spiritum esse\nuniversi qui omnia regit vivificat estque; ex quibus necessario sequitur omnia\nin eum reditura." Hist. Philos. I. 388. Jamblichus and Proclus also testify\nthat the Pythagorean doctrines of the origin of the material world from the\nDeity, and its identity with him, were much the same.
