Of the other (i.e. good works) also there is, in the same way, non-\nclinging; but at death.\n\nIn the preceding adhikara _n_ a it has been shown that, according to\nscriptural statements, all natural sin--which is the cause of the soul's\nbondage--does, owing to the power of knowledge, either not cling to the soul\nor undergo destruction. One might now think that works of religious duty which\nare enjoined by scripture are not opposed to knowledge also founded on\nscripture. In order to dispel this notion the reasoning of the last adhikara\n_n_ a is formally extended to the case under discussion. For him who knows\nthere is 'in the same way,' i.e. as in the case of sin, 'non-clinging' and\ndestruction 'of the other also,' i.e. of good works also; because such works\nalso, as productive of their own results, would be apt to obstruct thereby the\nresult of knowledge. Scripture also--in passages such as 'He overcomes both'\n(B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22)--declares that good works are extinguished no less\nthan evil ones, and the extinction of works which depends on the cognition of\nthe Self not being an agent is the same in the case of good and of evil works,\nand moreover there is a passage making a general statement without any\ndistinction, viz. 'And his works are extinguished' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8). And\neven there where the text mentions evil works only, we must consider good\nworks also to be implied therein, because the results of the latter also are\ninferior to the result of knowledge. Moreover scripture directly applies the\nterm 'evil works' to good works also, viz. in the passage, _Kh_. Up. VIII, 4,\ni, 'Day and night do not pass that bank,' where good works are mentioned\ntogether with evil works, and finally the term 'evil' is without any\ndistinction applied to all things mentioned before, 'All evil things\n\np. 357\n\nturn back from it.'--'But at death.' The word 'but' is meant for emphatical\nassertion. As it is established that good as well as evil works--which are\nboth causes of bondage--do, owing to the strength of knowledge, on the one\nhand not cling and on the other hand undergo destruction, there necessarily\nresults final release of him who knows as soon as death takes place.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 15](sbe38276.htm)\n\n"
