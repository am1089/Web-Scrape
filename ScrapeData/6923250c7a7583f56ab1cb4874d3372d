This\ndistinction, however, did not obtain in the early Vedic period. Originally the\ndeities, and especially Varuna and Mitra, were called Asuras, but in the later\npart of _Rigveda_ the term is applied chiefly to the enemies of the gods. In\nthe _Atharvaveda_ , as in subsequent Epic literature, the Asuras are simply\ndemons and giants and goblins.\n\nNo conclusive explanation can be offered as to how this remarkable change took\nplace in the course of the centuries embraced by the Vedic period. It may have\nbeen due primarily to sectarian strife between the religious teachers of those\ntribes which had been influenced by Babylonian modes of thought and those\nwhich clung tenaciously to the forms of primitive Aryan nature worship, and\nperhaps also the worship of ancestors (Pitris). In the old Persian language,\nwhich, like Greek, places\n\np. 62\n\n[paragraph continues] "h" before a vowel where "s" is used in Sanskrit, Ahura\n(= Asura) signifies "god". The Zoroastrian chief god is called Ahura-Mazda,\n"the wise Lord", as Varuna is addressed in early Rigvedic hymns, "wise Asura\nand King", and "the all-knowing Asura who established the heavens and fixed\nthe limits of the earth". On the other hand "daeva" in the Iranian dialect,\nwhich is cognate with Sanskrit "deva", "god", came to mean "demon". "Asura" is\nderived from the root "asu", which signifies "the air of life", and "deva"\nfrom "div", "to shine", or "deiwo", "heavenly".\n\nThe view has been urged that the revolt against "Asura" in India was due to\nthe hatred cherished towards the Persians who had become subject to the\nAssyrians, the worshippers of Ashur. It was originally based on the assumption\nthat Assyrian aggression caused the migration of Aryan tribes towards India.\nSubsequent research, however, has tended to dispel this theory. It has been\nfound, for instance, that Aryans were associated with the Kassites who\noverthrew the Hammurabi dynasty of Babylon prior to the invasion of the\nPunjab, and that the Assyrians were for a period vassals of the Mitanni kings,\nwho had Aryan names and worshipped Indra, Varuna, and Mithra in Mesopotamia\nand Asia Minor. The weak point in the Ashur-Asura theory is that it throws no\nlight on the process which caused the Persian "daeva" to be applied to demons\ninstead of to gods. How the gods of the Indian Aryans became the demons of\nPersia and the demons of Persia became the gods of India is a problem for\nwhich a solution has yet to be found.\n\nThe expository and speculative books of the priests--the _Brahmanas_ and\n_Upanishads_ \\--which are attached to the Vedic hymns, do not help us greatly\nin accounting for\n\np. 63\n\nthe change. We read that "the gods and Asuras contended together, and that the\nformer, being less numerous than the latter, took some bricks, and placing\nthem in a proper position to receive the sacrificial fire, with the formula,\n\'Thou art a multiplier\', they became numerous". 1\n\nIn one of the Brahmanas we are informed:\n\n"The Asuras performed at the sacrifice all that the Devas performed. The\nAsuras became thus of equal power with the Devas, and did not yet yield to\nthem. Thereupon the Devas had a vision of the \'silent praise\'. The Asuras, not\nknowing it, did not perform the \'silent praise\'. This \'silent praise\' is the\nlatent essence of the hymns. Till then, whatever weapons the Devas used\nagainst the Asuras, the Asuras used in revenge against them; but when the\nDevas had a vision of the \'silent praise\' and raised it as a weapon, the\nAsuras did not comprehend it. With it the Devas aimed a blow at the Asuras,\nand defeated them, for they had no comprehension of this weapon. Thereupon the\nDevas became masters of the Asuras. He who has such a knowledge becomes master\nof his enemy, adversary, and hater." 2\n\nThis explanation is but an echo of the Indra-Vritra combat. Another statement\nis to the effect that "the Devas gave up falsehood and adopted truth, while\nthe Asuras gave up truth and adopted falsehood". Further, we learn that when a\nsacrifice was performed the Asuras put the offerings into their own mouths,\nwhile the Suras (gods) gave the offerings they received to one another.\n\nThe Asuras became completely identified with the demons and giants; they\nsymbolized evil, darkness, and drought. In Epic literature we read that "in\nancient times the gods and Asuras were very active in destroying one another.\nAnd the terrible Asuras always succeeded in defeating the gods." . . . Indra\ngoes forth with\n\np. 64\n\nhis thunderbolt against Kesin, the leader of the Asuras, who wielded a great\nmace; this mace the demon hurled against the god, but Indra "cut it up in its\ncourse with his thunderbolt. Then Kesin, furious with rage, hurled a huge mass\nof rock at him." Indra "of a hundred sacrifices rent it asunder with his\nthunderbolt, and it fell down upon the ground. And Kesin himself was wounded\nby that falling mass of rock. 1 Thus sorely afflicted he fled". Indra rescues\na beautiful lady who had been seized by the Asura, and she informs the god\nthat her sister had previously fallen a victim to the demon. . . . 2\n\nThe Asuras obstructed sacrifices; they were ever hovering round altars to\ndiscover if rites were properly performed; if a priest did not perform a\nceremony in orthodox fashion, the sacrifice was of no avail, because the\nAsuras devoured it; if a man neglected a part of a ceremonial performance, a\ndemon might take possession of him and accomplish his ruin.\n\nOne of the terrible Asuras is the demon Rahu, who causes eclipses by\nswallowing the sun and the moon, like the Chinese dragon, the wolf Managarm of\nTeutonic mythology, and the Grecian demons who devour Helena, the sun maiden,\nsister of the twin Dioscuri. In the Vedic period Rahu was represented by the\ndemon Svarbhanu.\n\nThe Asuras of Ocean are the Daityas and Danavas, the descendants of the chaos\nhags Diti and Danu, and Kasyapa, a superhuman sage. These are the giants and\ndemons who fought against the gods like the Titans, the Irish Fomorians, and\nthe Norse Jotuns. Indra confined them in this region, which is called Patala,\nand they remain\n\n\n\n[![DURGA SLAYING GIANTS AND DEMONS<br> <i>From a sculpture at\nMamallapuram</i>.](tn/06400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/06400.jpg)  \nDURGA SLAYING GIANTS AND DEMONS  \n_From a sculpture at Mamallapuram_.  \n\n\n\np. 65\n\nthere "afflicted by Time ", 1 and subject to the sway of Varuna. Like the\nNorse giants, they will be let loose to take part in the "Last Battle". An\n"Asura fire" burns constantly in Patala, fed by water; it is "bound and\nconfined", but cannot be extinguished; when the end of all comes, it will\nburst forth and burn up the three worlds. 2 In Teutonic mythology the Universe\nis similarly doomed to be consumed by fire at Ragnarok, "the Dusk of the\nGods".\n\nThe abodes of these giants and demons are exceedingly beautiful; they are\nagleam with gold and precious stones; seats and beds are provided in the\nmansions, and there are also recreation grounds, and forests and mountains\nresembling clouds. Indeed, the Daityas and Danavas live pretty much in the\nsame manner as the gods, for "the gods and Danavas are brothers, although ever\nhostile to one another". 3 The Danava women are of gigantic stature, and wear\njewels as large as mountain boulders; when terrified by the attacks of the\ngods, they "bewail like unto cranes in Autumn". One of the Daitya tribes\nreside in the moving city named Hiranyapura, which they constructed for their\nprotection; sometimes it sinks below the sea, or under the earth; at other\ntimes it soars across the heavens like the sun. Indra, as we have seen, has a\nsimilar aerial city.\n\nIn the Underworld dwell also the Nagas, the demoniac Cobras; they are of human\nform to the waist, the rest of their bodies being like those of serpents.\nTheir king is Shesha, who is also named Vasuki and Karkotaka; he is sometimes\nrepresented with a thousand heads, and resembles Typhon, who fought with Zeus.\nIn the _Ramayana_ he is Ravana, the Demon of Ceylon. The\n\np. 66\n\nprototypes of Shesha and his hosts are the dragons Vritra, "the encompasser";\nAhi, "the confiner"; and fierce Kushna, "the scorcher", who spits out the\nsunset fires and burns up day.\n\nWhen serpent worship became prevalent among the Aryans, the Nagas were\nregarded as demigods. They were occasionally "the friends of man", and to\nthose they favoured they gave draughts of their nectar, which endowed them\nwith great strength. Their city was the Paradise of serpent worshippers. The\nfemale Nagas were beautiful nymphs, who were sometimes wooed by mortals.\n\nAs the Asuras are the enemies of the gods, the Rakshas or Rakshasas are the\nenemies of man. 1 These demons are "night prowlers"; they have greatest power\nafter "the first forty seconds of grey twilight preceding nightfall". They\ntravel faster than the wind, and go through the air; they have also power to\nchange their shape. Sometimes they appear in the guise of tigers, bears, or\ngreat monkeys; and their hues vary from yellow to red, and blue to green. In\nthe _Ramayana_ they are found associated with the Asuras of Ceylon; a spy\nenters a demon dwelling and sees them in all their shapes, some frightfully\ndeformed, with small bodies and long arms; some as grotesque dwarfs, others as\nhorrible giants with long projecting teeth; some with one eye, others with\nthree eyes; some with one leg, two legs, or three, or even four; and some with\nheads of serpents, horses, or elephants. In the _Mahabharata_ the Rakshasas\nare like gorillas; they have arrow-shaped ears, big red eyes, and red hair and\nbeards, and mouths like caves; they feast on human beings and cattle. The\nheroic Bhima, like Siegfried Dietrich of Bern, Beowulf, and Finn-mac-Cowl,\n\np. 67\n\nis a mighty slayer of these man-eating demons. They are impervious to weapons,\nbut Bhima wrestles with them and breaks their backs or tears them asunder,\nafter lively combats with trees and boulders. Female Rakshasas sometimes fall\nin love with human beings, and transform themselves into beautiful women.\nBhima takes one for his bride, and she carries him through the air to a\nCelestial retreat among the mountains.\n\nThe most loathsome Rakshasas are the goblin-like Pisachas, 1 who are devourers\nof dead bodies in cemeteries, and are exceedingly vile and malignant fiends.\nThey are the bringers of diseases and wasting fevers. In the _Atharvaveda_\nAgni is invoked by the priests, who mutter charms over suffering and\n"possessed" mortals, to take the Pisachas between his teeth and devour them.\nThey are "those who hound us in our chambers, while shouting goes on in the\nnight of the new moon . . . the flesh devourers, who plan to injure us, and\nwhom I overcome". The priest declares: "I plague the Pisachas as the tiger the\ncattle owners. As dogs who have seen a lion, these do not find a refuge. . . .\nFrom villages I enter Pisachas fly away. . . . May Nirriti (a goddess of\ndestruction) take hold of this one." 2\n\nKali, a demon who holds friendly converse with the gods in the "Story of\nNala", is attended by Dwapara, a flesh-eater like the Pisachas. The Panis are\naerial demons, who are hated by bluff, honest Indra, because they are the\ninspirers of foolish actions, slander, and unbelief, and the imps who\nencourage men to neglect homage to deities. The black Dasyus are repulsive of\naspect and jealous-hearted; they are the stealers of the cloud cows who are\nheld captive for Vritra in the cave\n\np. 68\n\nof the demon Vala. The Darbas, "the tearers", are a variety of Pisachas.\nReference is made in _Mahabharata_ to "ugly Vartikas of dreadful sight, having\none wing, one eye, and one leg"; when they "vomit blood, facing the sun", a\ndreadful happening is known to be at hand, because they are fiends of evil\nomen.\n\nAmong the supernatural beings who are sometimes the enemies, but in most cases\nthe friends of mankind, are the Yakshas, the Gandharvas, and the Apsaras\n(Apsarasas).\n\nThe Yakshas are occasionally referred to as the Punyajanas, "the good people";\nthey may be of human stature, with big benevolent eyes, or powerful giants who\ncan fight as fiercely as Rakshasas. They are guardians of hidden treasure,\nlike the dwarfs and giants of Teutonic legend, being associated with Kuvera,\ngod of wealth, whose abode is situated among the Himalayan mountains. In\nKuvera\'s domain are found "multitudes of spirits" who do not visit the world\nof men as a rule, but remain near the treasure for purposes of defence; "some\nare of dwarfish stature, some of fierce visage, some hunchbacked, some of\nblood-red eyes, some of frightful yells; some are feeding upon fat and flesh,\nand some are terrible to behold; and all are armed with various weapons, and\nendued with the speed of the wind". 1\n\nThe Gandharvas are grouped in tribes, and number over six thousand\nindividuals. They are all of the male sex. They haunt the air, the forests,\nand the mountains, and, like the Rakshasas, have power to work illusions in\nthe grey twilight before nightfall. References are made in the Epics to their\ncombats with human beings. To warriors who overcome them they impart\ninstruction in religious matters; those whom they conquer they carry\n\n\n\n[![THE CELESTIAL FAIRIES \\(APSARAS\\)<br> <i>Sculpture on a modern Hindu\ntemple, Benares</i>.](tn/06800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/06800.jpg)  \nTHE CELESTIAL FAIRIES (APSARAS)  \n_Sculpture on a modern Hindu temple, Benares_.  \n\n\n\np. 69\n\naway, like the Teutonic elves and dwarfs. The Gandharvas are renowned\nmusicians and bards and singers. When they play on their divine instruments\nthe fairy-like Apsaras, who are all females, dance merrily. In the various\nAryan heavens these elves and fairies delight and allure with music and song\nand dance the gods, and the souls of those who have attained to a state of\nbliss. The Apsara dancing girls are "voluptuous and beautiful", and inspire\nlove in Paradise as well as upon earth. Their lovers include gods, Gandharvas,\nand mortals. Arjuna, the human son of Indra, who was transported in a\nCelestial chariot to Swarga over Suravithi, "the Milky Way", was enchanted by\nthe music and songs and dances of the Celestial elves and fairies. He followed\nbands of Gandharvas who were "skilled in music sacred and profane", and he saw\nthe bewitching Apsaras, including the notorious Menaka, "with eyes like lotus\nblooms, employed in enticing hearts"; they had "fair round hips and slim\nwaists", and "began to perform various evolutions, shaking their deep bosoms\nand casting their glances around, and exhibiting other attractive attitudes\ncapable of stealing the hearts and resolutions and minds of the spectators". 1\n\nIn the _Rigveda_ there is a water-nymph, named Apsaras; she is the "spouse" of\nGandharva, an atmospheric deity who prepares Soma for the gods and reveals\ndivine truths to mortals. They vanish, however, in later times; the other\nVedas deal with the spirit groups which figure so prominently in the Epics. No\ndoubt the groups are older than Gandharva, the god, and Apsaras, the goddess,\nwho may be simply the elf-king and the fairy-queen. The "black" Dasyus are\nsometimes referred to by modern-day writers as the dark aborigines who were\ndisplaced by the\n\np. 70\n\n[paragraph continues] Aryans; a tribal significance is also given to the\nRakshasas and the Gandharvas. But this tendency to identify the creatures of\nthe spirit world with human beings may be carried too far. If "Dasyus" were\nreally "dark folk", 1 it should be remembered that in Teutonic mythology there\nare "black dwarfs", who live in underground dwellings, and "white elves"\nassociated with air and ocean; there are also black and white fairies in the\nScottish High-lands, so that black and white spirits may simply belong to\nnight and day spirit groups. It may be that the Indian aborigines were\nreferred to contemptuously as Dasyus by the Aryans. The application of the\nnames of repulsive imps to human enemies is not an unfamiliar habit even in\nour own day; in China the European is a "foreign devil", but Chinese "devils"\nexisted long before Europeans secured a footing in the Celestial Kingdom.\nThose who seek for a rational explanation for the belief in the existence of\nmythical beings should remember that primitive man required no models for the\ncreatures of his fancy. He symbolized everything--his ideals, his desires, his\nhopes and his fears, the howling wind, the low whispering breeze, the creaking\ntree, the torrent, the river, the lake, and the mountain; he heard the hammer\nor the trumpet of a mighty god in the thunderstorm, he believed that giants\nuprooted trees and cast boulders down mountain slopes, that demons raised\nocean billows in tempest, and that the strife of the elements was a war\nbetween gods and giants; day and night, ever in conflict, were symbolized, as\nwere also summer and winter, and growth and decay. If the fairies and elves of\nEurope are Lapps, or the small men of an interglacial period\n\np. 71\n\nin the Pleistocene Age, and if the Dasyus and Gandharvas of India are merely\nDravidians and pre-Dravidians who resisted the Aryan invasion, who, then, it\nmay be asked, were the prototypes of the giants "big as mountains", or the\ndemons like "trees walking", the "tiger-headed" Rakshasas, "ugly Vartikas"\nwith "one wing, one eye, and one leg"? and what animal suggested Vritra, or\nthe fiery dragon that burned up daylight, or Rahu, the swallower of sun and\nmoon? If the redhaired and red-bearded Rakshasas are to be given a racial\nsignificance, what of the blue Rakshasas and the green? The idea that\nprimitive man conceived of giants because he occasionally unearthed the bones\nof prehistoric monsters, is certainly not supported by Scottish evidence;\nScotland swarms with giants and hags of mountain, ocean, and river, although\nit has not yielded any great skeletons or even a single artifact of the\nPalaeolithic Age. Giants and fairies are creations of fancy. Just as a highly\nimaginative child symbolizes his fears and peoples darkness with terrifying\nmonsters, so, it may be inferred, did primitive man who crouched in his cave,\nor spent sleepless nights in tempest-stricken forests, conceive with childlike\nmind of demons thirsting for his blood and giants of wind and fire intent on\ndestroying the Universe.\n\nIn India, as elsewhere, the folk of the spirit world might woo or be wooed by\nimpressionable mortals. A Gandharva related to Arjuna, the Pandava prince, by\nwhom he was defeated in single combat, the "charming story", as he called it,\nof King Samvarana and the fairy-like Tapati, a daughter of the sun god, Surya.\nTapati was of all nymphs the most beautiful; she was "perfectly symmetrical"\nand "exquisitely attired"; she had "faultless features, and black, large\neyes"; and, in contrast to an Apsara, she "was chaste and exceedingly well\nconducted".\n\np. 72\n\n[paragraph continues] For a time the sun god considered that no husband could\nbe found who was worthy of his daughter; and therefore "knew no peace of mind,\nalways thinking of the person he should select". One day, however, King\nSamvarana worshipped the sun, and made offerings of flowers and sweet\nperfumes, and Surya resolved to bestow his daughter upon this ideal man.\n\nIt came to pass that Samvarana went a-hunting deer on the mountains. He rode\nswiftly in pursuit of a nimble-footed stag, leaving his companions behind,\nuntil his steed expired with exhaustion. Then he wandered about alone. In a\nsecluded wood he beheld a maiden of exquisite beauty; he gazed at her\nsteadfastly for a time, thinking she was a goddess or "the embodiment of the\nrays emanating from the sun". Her body was as radiant as fire and as spotless\nas the crescent moon; she stood motionless like to a golden statue. The\nflowers and the creepers round about partook of her beauty, and "seemed to be\nconverted into gold". She was Tapati, daughter of the sun.\n\nThe king\'s eyes were captivated, his heart was wounded by the arrows of the\nlove god Kama; he lost his peace of mind. At length he spoke and said: "Who\nart thou, O fair one? O maiden of sweet smiles, why dost thou linger in these\nlonely woods? I have never seen or heard of one so beautiful as thee. . . .\nThe love god tortures me."\n\nThat lotus-eyed maiden made no answer; she vanished from sight like to\nlightning in the clouds.\n\nThe king hastened through the forest, lamenting for her: he searched in vain;\nhe stood motionless in grief; he fell down on the earth and swooned.\n\nThen, smiling sweetly, the maiden appeared again. In honeyed words she spoke,\nsaying: "Arise, thou tiger\n\np. 73\n\namong kings. It is not meet that thou shouldst lose thy reason in this\nmanner."\n\nSamvarana opened his eyes and beheld Tapati. Weak with emotion he spoke and\nsaid: "I am burning with love for thee, thou black-eyed beauty, O accept me.\nMy life is ebbing away. . . . I have been bitten by Kama, who is even like a\nvenomous snake. Have mercy on me. . . . O thou of handsome and faultless\nfeatures, O thou of face like unto the lotus or the moon, O thou of voice\nsweet as that of singing Kinnaras, my life now depends on thee. Without thee,\nO timid one, I am unable to live. It behoveth thee not, O black-eyed maid, to\ncast me off; it behoveth thee to relieve me from this affliction by giving me\nthy love. At the first sight thou hast distracted my heart. My mind wandereth.\nBe merciful; I am thy obedient slave, thy adorer. O accept me. . . . O thou of\nlotus eyes, the flame of desire burneth within me. O extinguish that flame by\nthrowing on it the water of thy love. . . . " 1\n\nTapati replied: "I am not mistress of mine own self. I am a maiden ruled by my\nfather. If thou dost love me, demand me of him. My heart hath been robbed by\nthee."\n\nThen, revealing her identity, Tapati ascended to heaven, and once again\nSamvarana fell upon the earth and swooned.\n\nThe ministers and followers of the king carne searching for him, and found him\n"lying forsaken on the ground like a rainbow dropped from the firmament". They\nsprinkled his face with cool and lotus-scented water. When he revived, the\nmonarch sent away all his followers except one minister. For twelve days he\nworshipped the sun constantly on the mountain top. Then a great\n\np. 74\n\n[paragraph continues] Rishi, whom he had sent for, came to him, and the Rishi\nascended to the sun. Ere long he returned with Tapati, the sun god having\ndeclared that Samvarana would be a worthy husband for his daughter.\n\nFor twelve years the king lived with his fairy bride in the mountain forests,\nand a regent ruled over the kingdom.\n\nBut although the monarch enjoyed great bliss, living the life of a Celestial,\nthe people of the kingdom suffered greatly. For twelve years no rain fell,\n"not even a drop of dew came from the skies, and no corn was grown". The\npeople were afflicted with famine; men grew reckless, and deserted their wives\nand children; the capital became like to a city of the dead.\n\nThen a great Rishi brought Samvarana back to his capital with his Celestial\nbride. And after that things became as they were before. Rain fell in\nabundance and corn was grown. "Revived by that foremost of monarchs of\nvirtuous soul, the capital and the country became glad with exceeding joy." 1\nA son was born to the king, and his name was Kuru.\n\nThere are many other uncatalogued Celestial beings like Tapati in Indian\nfairyland. In the _Atharva-veda_ there are numerous named and nameless spirits\nof good and evil, and throughout the Epics references are made to semi-divine\nbeings who haunt streams, lakes, forests, and plains. A Rigveda hymn is\naddressed to the forest nymph Aranyani. She echoes the voices of man and beast\nand creates illusions:\n\nShe mimics kine that crop the grass,  \nShe rumbles like a cart at even, p. 75  \nShe calls a cow, she hews down wood,  \nThe man who lingers says, "Who calleth?"\n\nO Aranyani will not harm  \nIf one will not invade her dwelling,  \nWhen, having eaten luscious fruit,  \nAt her sweet will she turns to slumber.\n\nThe singing birds are all singing spirits in India as in Europe. The "language\nof birds" is the language of spirits. When Siegfried, after eating of the\ndragon\'s heart, understood the "language of birds", he heard them warning him\nregarding his enemies. Our seafarers whistle when they invoke the spirit of\nthe wind. Sir Walter Scott drew attention, in his _Minstrelsy of the Scottish\nBorder_ , to the belief that the speech of spirits was a kind of whistling. As\nwe have seen, the wives of Danavas had voices like Cranes; Homer\'s ghosts\ntwittered like bats; Egyptian ghosts were hooting owls. In India the croaking\nraven is still a bird of evil omen, as it is also in the West. In the Scottish\nHighlands the spirits of the dead sometimes appear as birds; so do fairies.\nThe Irish gods and the Celestial Rishis of India take the form of swans, like\nthe "swan maidens", when they visit mankind. In the Assyrian legend of Ishtar\nthe souls of the dead in Hades "are like birds covered with feathers".\nNumerous instances could be quoted to illustrate the widespread association of\nbirds with the spirit world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[63:1](iml09.htm#fr_113) Muir\'s _Original Sanskrit Texts_ , v, 15.\n\n[63:2](iml09.htm#fr_114) Professor E.
