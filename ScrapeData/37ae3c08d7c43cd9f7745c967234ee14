But (vidyas) connected with wishes may, according to one's liking, be\ncumulated or not; on account of the absence of the former reason.\n\nThe above Sutra supplies a counter-instance to the preceding Sutra.--We have,\non the other hand, vidyas connected with definite wishes; as e.g. _Kh_. Up.\nIII, 15, 2, 'He who knows that the wind is the child of the regions never\nweeps for his sons;' _Kh_. Up. VII, 1, 5, 'He who meditates on name as\nBrahman, walks at will as far as name reaches.' In these vidyas which, like\nactions, effect their own special results by means of their 'unseen' Self,\nthere is no reference to any intuition, and one therefore may, according to\none's liking, either cumulate them or not cumulate them; 'on account of the\nabsence of the former reason,' i.e. because there is not the reason for option\nwhich was stated in the preceding Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 61](sbe38204.htm)\n\n"
