The King spoke :-- O highly honoured and intelligent one! I have heard the\nanecdote just related to me by you. I am very much bewildered. This Samsara\n(world) is vice incarnate. I wonder how the Jivas, entangled in its meshes,\ncan again be freed!\n\n\n\np. 261\n\n\n\n2\\. When the son of Kas'yapa, whose kingdom is the three worlds, can commit\nsuch an heinous act, what wonder, then, that any other ordinary person would\ndo more blameable things!\n\n\n\n3\\. On the pretence of serving and on a solemn oath, when a man, can enter\ninto his step-mother's womb and take away the life of the son, what more\nheinous and dreadful can take place than this!\n\n\n\n4\\. When the preserver and controller of religion, the ruler of the three\nworlds can do such acts, you cannot expect that any other person would desert\nfrom committing heinous, contemptible acts.\n\n\n\n5\\. O World Teacher! Indeed my grandfather did unjustifiable horrible mean\nacts in the battle field of Kuruk _s_ ettra. It is really wonderful!\n\n\n\n6-7. Bhi _s_ ma, Dro _n_ a, Kripa, Kar _n_ a, even Yudhis _t_ hira, who is the\npart incarnate of Dharma all these were urged by Vasudeva into this contrary\nreligious act. These personages are all born of Devamsas, devoted to religion,\nand intelligent. These know the transitory nature of this world; how can these\ncommit such mean blameable things!\n\n\n\n8\\. O Glory of the Brahmi _n_ s! What faith or regard can we have for a\nreligion, when such high souled persons commit such irreligious acts! Indeed,\nthere is doubt whether religion exists at all or not! O Best of the Munis! My\nheart is agitated very much on hearing these incidents.\n\n\n\n9\\. If it be said that the word of the \xc3\x82ptas (seers) is a sufficient guarantee\nfor the entity of religion, it may then be questioned where there is such an\n\xc3\x82pta, holding such a pure religious body? All those persons who are attached\nto worldliness are bent on all worldly objects with their whole head and\nheart; these, therefore, cannot be \xc3\x82ptas.\n\n\n\n10\\. When self interest is obstructed, jealousy and anger arise; and to secure\none's self interest, out of jealousy, arise untruthful words.\n\n\n\n11\\. Even the pure, excellent, virtuous S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, with full\nconsciousness, had to assume under pretence a Brahmi _n_ form for killing\nJarasandha.\n\n\n\n12\\. Just as the holy S'ri Hari assumed a false appearance to kill Jarasandha,\nsimilarly Arju _n_ a, too, did a false sacrifice to accomplish his ends. Where\nis, then, one who can claim to be an \xc3\x82pta? And what proof is there of the\nexistence of such an \xc3\x82pta?\n\n\n\np. 262\n\n\n\n13\\. What sort of sacrifice was this? Did it lead to heaven in the next world\nor did it lead to glory or did it serve the cause of any good will? Why was it\ndeprived of that peace and rest? (It was performed with a view to kill\nS'isupala and others).\n\n\n\n14-15. The Pundits, of yore, declare that truth is the first Pada,\ncleanliness, the second; compassion, the third; and charity is the fourth Pada\n(foot) of Dharma (Religion). Thus, devoid of these, how can Religion stand\nwith due regards from all?\n\n\n\n16\\. How can an act bear good fruits, which has no trace of virtue in it? It\nseems no one had any trace of faith and steadiness in one's religion. (The Pan\n_d_ avas did sacrifice out of arrogance; how can they be \xc3\x82ptas?)\n\n\n\n17-20. Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of the Universe, assumed His Dwarf (Vamana)\nIncarnation with the express object to cheat Vali, the king of the Daityas.\nNow, O Muni! The king Bali, performed one hundred sacrifices; he was the\nprotector of the Vedas, virtuous, charitable, truthful and self controlled;\nwhy was such a man dislodged from his position by Vi _sn_ u, the Powerful. Who\nwas victorious in this affair? Was he the Vali, who was cheated? Or was it\nVamana Deva, the expert in making nice pretence? Who was the better of the\ntwo? I have got grave doubts on this point. O the best of the twiceborn! You\nare the\n\ncomposer of the Pura _n_ as, virtuous, and liberal hearted. Speak what is true\n(and thus tranquil my heart).\n\n\n\n21-23. Vyasa said :-- O king! The victory was certainly Bali's, in as much as\nhe fulfilled his promise and gave over his kingdom of earth to Vi _sn_ u. And\nin as much as Vi _sn_ u in his 5th or dwarf Incarnation deceived Bali, he had\nto become a dwarf (i. e. a small mean person indicated even by the shortness\nof his body). O king! There is nothing superior in religion\n\nto truth. See! S\xc2\x92ri Hari even had to become, for his falsehood, a gate keeper\nof Vali. O king! It is hardly possible for a human being to observe in every\nway the injunctions of truth.\n\n\n\n24\\. Powerful, indeed, is Maya, composed of the three qualities and of various\nforms. By Her is created this Universe, made manifold by the admixture of the\nthree qualities (Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas).\n\n\n\n25\\. How can you expect therefore, truth to be observed wholly, without the\nleast violation, by a deceiver. This world is made up of the mixture of Rajas;\nO king! Know this as the every day routine of things in nature.\n\n\n\np. 263\n\n\n\n26-27. It is only the Munis and Hermits that can observe pure truth; and that\nis why they are without any attachment; they do not accept any thing from any\nother body; they are desireless; and they all have no rough wear and tear of\nthe world. They exist as perfect examples; their case is quite separate. All\nthe others are caught under the meshes of the three Mayic Gu _n_ as.\n\n\n\n28\\. O Best of kings! The Dharma S\xc2\x92astras, Pura _n_ as and the Angas the Vedas\nare full of diverse opinions on any one point under consideration for their\ncomposers were under the influence of the different Gu _n_ as.\n\n\n\n29\\. The Sagu _n_ a persons (i. e. persons under Maya) do Sagu _n_ a works\n(works composed of qualities) and the Nirgu _n_ a persons (i. e. persons above\nMaya) do not do any Sagu _n_ a work. And when the Gu _n_ as are mixed with one\nanother, they cannot remain pure (i. e. they exhibit qualities of those Gu _n_\nas with which they are mixed).\n\n\n\n30\\. O king! One is influenced by Maya no sooner one takes one's birth in this\nworld; so that no body can remain steady in this pure, steady maxim of truth,\nuntainted by any falsehood or deceit.\n\n\n\n31\\. The sense organs, Indriyas, confound the Buddhi (reason) and make one\nfollow the path of enjoying sensual things. Mind is attached to senses and\nfollows diverse ways, urged on furiously by the three Gu _n_ as.\n\n\n\n32\\. O king! All the beings, Brahma down to the moving and non-moving things,\nfall under the delusion of Maya; She plays with them.\n\n\n\n33\\. This Maya is always imposing on all; and She is incessantly making\nformations and transformations in this Universe; O king of kings! The man\nunder the influence of action takes recourse to this untruth (i.e., actions\narise first from this untruth) from the very moment of his birth.\n\n\n\n34\\. Persons when they do not get their desired objects after they have\npondered how to secure the sensual objects, take recourse to pretext, and,\nfrom that pretext do many sinful acts.\n\n\n\n35\\. Lust, anger, and avarice; these three are very powerful enemies. The\nJivas under their influence cannot distinguish the right from the wrong.\n\n\n\n36\\. When wealth, might and rank come to a person, he gets deep-rooted\nAhamkara, and becomes very egoistic; from Ahamkara, delusion comes and, from\ndelusion, insensibility and death ensue.\n\n\n\n37-38. Here men argue mentally many plans; and thence jealousy, intolerance\nand enmity spring in the heart; next arise, out of delusion, hope, thirst,\nmisery, low-spiritedness, arrogance and irreligiousness.\n\n\n\np. 264\n\n\n\n39\\. It is through Ahamkara that people are led to perform sacrifices,\ncharities, visit places of pilgrimages, practise vows and rules for religious\nrites and ceremonies.\n\n\n\n40\\. Hence these sacrificial acts, etc., proceeding from Ahamkara, are unable\nto remove the clouds of impurity from the mind, as observance of purity and\ncleanliness does. Especially when any action is done through greed or undue\naffection, as its motive, it cannot be pure in every respect.\n\n\n\n41\\. Therefore, at the commencement of any sacrifice, the wise persons look at\nthe purity of sacrificial things; (Dravya Suddhi); those articles that are\ncollected without injuring others, are the best in religious acts.\n\n\n\n42\\. O best of Kings! If the things, acquired by injuring others, be utilised\nin any auspicious act, they yield contrary results at the time of fruition.\n\n\n\n43\\. It is he only, whose mind is very pure and undefiled, who gets the\nresults wholly auspicious from any sacrificial act. Minds defiled do not\nacquire their proper desired objects.\n\n\n\n44-45. When the preceptor and the priests ordained are sincere and pure;\nmoreover, when the place, moment, act, sacrificial things, the mantras, and\nthe sacrificer are all holy, then and there only, the full results accrue in\ntheir entirety to the sacrificer.\n\n\n\n46\\. If the sacrifice be intended for the destruction of one's enemy or for a\npersonal motive and one's gain, it converts auspicious results into those that\nare inauspicious and lead to ruin in the end.\n\n\n\n47\\. Selfish persons are unable to ascertain, which actions are auspicious and\nwhich are not; they depend on the circumstances what they call Daiva, and the\npeople do acts sinful instead of virtuous.\n\n\n\n48-49. The Devas and demons all are created by Brahma, the Prajapati, the\nCreator; they all are selfish; hence they are at war and war with each other.\nThe Devas are born from the Sattva Guna; the human beings are sprung from the\nRajas and the birds are sprung from the Tamas.\n\n\n\n50\\. O King! When the Devas, born of the Sattva Guna are always engaged in\ninimical actions, what wonder, then, is there, that the lower ones would be at\nwar with one another!\n\n\n\n51-52. O King! When the Devas are always discontented, filled with jealousy\nand envy, at war amongst each other, and obstructors of the ascetics and the\naustere persons, then know that this Universe has sprung from Ahamkara\n(egoism). How can you expect them to be free from feelings of anger, jealousy;\netc.!\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourth Chapter of the Fourth Book, the Maha Puranam S\xc2\x92ri Mad\nDevi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses on Adharma by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk04ch05.htm)\n\n"
