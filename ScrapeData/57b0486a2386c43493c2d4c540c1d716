Vyasa said :-- O best of kings! There is no need of dwelling at length on\nthis point; suffice to say, that in this world, are found persons very rare\nthat are religious, and free from egoism, jealousy, anger, etc.\n\n\n\n2\\. O king of kings! Even in the Satya Yuga, the Golden age, this world,\nmoving and unmoving, was covered with feelings of jealousy and anger. What to\nsay in this Kali Yuga (Dark Age)! (There is no wonder that this world would be\nfull of these vicious things.)\n\n\n\n3\\. O best of kings! When the Devas are deceitful, jealous, and filled with\nfeelings of anger, what is to be said with human beings and other lower\ncreations!\n\n\n\n4\\. O Lord of the Earth! It is natural, that injury be inflicted on those\npersons that commit injury; but when peaceful persons, void of any enmity, are\ninjured, that is certainly an act wicked and mischievous.\n\n\n\n5\\. Whenever, any devout ascetic, calm and quiet, is engaged in prayer and\nmeditation, and silent muttering of one's mantrams, the king of the Immortals\nthrows hindrance in his asceticism. (This is certainly a mischievous act.)\n\n\n\n6\\. (Holy, unholy and mixed persons exist in all the yugas). To those that are\nholy, all the yugas are the Satya yuga; to the unholy ones always it is the\nKali yuga (Dark age); and to the mixed ones, always it is Treta and Dvapara.\n\n\n\n7\\. You will very seldom find a few persons, following really the True\nReligion; otherwise, you would have found all the persons in the different\nyugas religious, appropriate to those yugas.\n\n\n\n8\\. O king! In all cases where the conservation of religions and religious\naffairs are concerned, know that the original wish and desire is the cause. If\nthis desire be impure and sullied, religion becomes also sullied for, verily,\nthis impurity in one's desire is one's cause of ruin in every respect.\n(Therefore the impure desires are never to be cherished and indulged.)\n\n\n\n9\\. A son, named Dharma, was born of the heart of Brahma; he was devoted to\nBrahmajnana (the knowledge of Brahma), truthful, and always engaged in rites\nand ceremonies and in accordance with the Vedic religion.\n\n\n\n10\\. This high souled Muni Dharma was a householder and married duly,\naccording to the proper procedure, to the ten daughters of Dak _s_ a\nPrajapati.\n\n\n\n11\\. This Dharma, the foremost amongst the followers of truth, impregnated\nthem and had four sons, named respectively Hari, Kri _sn_ a, Nara, and Naraya\n_n_ a.\n\n\n\np. 266\n\n\n\n12\\. Hari and Kri _sn_ a, amongst the four, used to remain always in the\npractising of the yoga.\n\n\n\n13\\. Nara and Naraya _n_ a came over to the Himalayan mountains and, in the\nhermitage of Badarika, commenced the difficult religious asceticism and\npenance.\n\n\n\n14\\. The foremost of the ascetics, those two ancient Munis, began to recite\nthat highest mantra of Para Brahma, the Gayatri, on the wide spacious bank of\nthe Ganges.\n\n\n\n15\\. The two Risis named Nara and Naraya _n_ a, born of Hari's Ams'a,\npractised excellent tapasya for full one thousand years.\n\n\n\n16\\. The whole Universe, moving and unmoving, became hot through the Fire of\ntheir Tapas. Indra became also perplexed.\n\n\n\n17-18. The thousand-eyed Indra became anxious, thought and within himself thus\n:-- What is to be done now? These two sons of Dharma are practising Tapas and\nare in meditation. If they succeed, they can occupy my excellent seat in\nHeaven; how can I break their Tapasya and what steps shall I take to hinder\nthem.\n\n\n\n19-20. Lust, anger, and insurmountable avarice Indra brought into existence\nand, intent on hindering their tapasya, mounted on the elephant Airavata, went\nquickly to the hill Gandhamadan, and approaching the holy hermitage, saw the\ntwo ancient Ri _s_ is.\n\n\n\n21\\. Their bodies were incandescent by Tapasya, as if they were the two rising\nSuns. Were they Brahma, Vi _sn_ u manifested there or were they the two\nshining sources of light? These two Ri _s_ is were the sons of Dharma. What\nwould they do with their Tapasya?\n\n\n\n22-23. Thinking thus, the lord of S'achi seeing them addressed thus :-- O\nhighly fortunate ones! O two Ri _s_ is the sons of Dharma! Please tell me what\nare your objects? I have come here to give thee excellent boons; I am very\npleased with your Tapasya; therefore ask boons from me; and even if they be\nnot worth giving, I will give them to you.\n\n\n\n24-25. Vyasa said :-- The Ri _s_ is were deeply immersed in meditation and\nseemed very firm and resolute; they, therefore, did not reply anything, though\nIndra, standing before them, repeatedly urged them to ask boons from him.\nSeeing this, the king of the Immortals began to terrify them with his\nsupernatural enchanting fearful mayic powers.\n\n\n\n26\\. He created lions, tigers, wolves and other murderous animals and began to\nterrify the two Ri _s_ is with them; Indra also produced rains, hurricanes and\nfires very frequently so that they might yield.\n\n\n\n27\\. In spite of Indra's attempt to terrify them by his wonderful Maya, the\ntwo Munis, Nara Naraya _n_ a, the two sons of Dharma, could not be brought\nunder his control. And Indra returned to his own place.\n\n\n\np. 267\n\n\n\n28-31. And he became very sorry and thought thus :-- These two Munis could not\nbe tempted away with boons, nor did they fly away from their place of worship,\nthough terrified with fire, wind, wolves, tigers and lions. No one, I think,\nwould be able to break their meditation. When fear and temptations have not\ndistracted their meditation, they are certainly meditating on the Eternal Maha\nVidya S'ri Bhuvanes'wari, the Prime Force of Nature, the Source of all Mayas,\nand the Goddess the Creatrix of all the worlds, the wonderful highest\nPrakriti; what other expert in emitting Maya there can be? Who can break their\nmeditation!\n\n\n\n32\\. Indeed! how can this whole host of Mayas that are created by Gods and\nAsuras overpower those purged of all their sins, who are meditating their\nCreator, the Supreme Maya, that Illusion by which one considers the unreal\nUniverse as really existent and as distinct from the Supreme Spirit, whence\nthe Gods and Asuras have derived all their supernatural powers.\n\n\n\n33\\. He in whose heart reign the seed mantras of Vak, Kama and Maya, called\nVagvijam, Kamavijam, Mayavijam, no one is able to stand against and overpower\nhim.\n\n\n\n34-35. O king! Indra, enchanted by Maya, did not desist from tempting the two\nRi _s_ is, but he went on thinking other means by which their asceticism could\nbe baffled and asked Kama and Vasanta (the god of Lust and the season spring)\nto come before him and addressed them, thus :-- O Kama! You now be united with\nyour wife Rati and Vasanta (the God of spring) and go to the hill Gandhamadan,\naccompanied by all the Apsaras (celestial damsels) and with all the Rasas\n(love sentiments).\n\n\n\nNOTE :-- The Gandhamadan is the mountain like unsurpassable intoxicating\nhappiness of the senses.\n\n\n\n36-37. There you will find the two ancient excellent Ri _s_ is Nara and Naraya\n_n_ a practising asceticism in solitude, in the hermitage of Badarika. O\nManamatha! You better go before them, and with the influence of your arrows,\ndo now my work and make their hearts extremely lustful.\n\n\n\n38\\. O Fortunate One! Charm over them by means of your arrows, make them leave\ntheir asceticism by magical spells.\n\n\n\n39\\. Who is there in this world of Devas, Daityas, human beings, that, being\nwhipped by your arrows, do not come under your control?\n\n\n\n40\\. When Brahma, I, Mahadeva, Moon and Fire are all fascinated by your\narrows, then is there any doubt that these two Ri _s_ is would not be\nfascinated by them!\n\n\n\n41\\. I am sending these public women as your assistants. Rambha and other\nbeautiful celestial nymphs would all follow you.\n\n\n\np. 268\n\n\n\n42\\. You alone, or Rambha or Tilottama alone can do this work. Will there be\nany doubt if you all unite in this?\n\n\n\n43\\. O Good One! Do this work for me; I will confer on you your desired\nobjects.\n\n\n\n44\\. O Manmatha! I tempted them with boons but these two ascetics, of\ncontrolled minds, could not be displaced from their seats. My efforts were\nrendered useless.\n\n\n\n45\\. I frightened them very much with all the Mayic powers; yet they could not\nbe dislocated from their deep thoughts. It seems that they are quite heedless\nin the preservation of their bodies.\n\n\n\n46\\. Vyasa said :-- Kamadeva, on hearing the king of the Devas, addressed him\nthus :-- O Indra! Today I will fulfill all your desires.\n\n\n\n47\\. But there is one word. If these two ascetics be meditating Vi _sn_ u,\nS\xc2\x92iva or Brahma or the Sun, then I will be able to bring them under my\ncontrol.\n\n\n\n48\\. And if they be meditating on the Great Seed Mantra, the root of all Maya,\nand the great Kamavijam, the king of the Kama, I will never be able to subdue\nsuch a devotee of the Highest Devi.\n\n\n\n49\\. If these two ascetics have devotedly taken refuge of the Great Power Maha\nDevi, then they will not come under the sight of my arrows.\n\n\n\n50\\. Indra said :-- O Blessed One! Go now with your assistants, ready to do\nyour work. No body but you, I find, that can fulfill my this beneficial,\nthough very difficult work.\n\n\n\nVyasa said :-- Thus ordered by Indra, they all departed to where the Dharma's\nsons Nara, and Naraya _n_ a were performing their hard Tapasyas.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifth Chapter in the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam,\nthe Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk04ch06.htm)\n\n"
