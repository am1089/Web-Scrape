XXIX.\n\nIndra comes to Dwaraka, and reports to Krishn\xcc\x81a the tyranny of Naraka.\nKrishn\xcc\x81a goes to his city, and puts him to death. Earth gives the earrings of\nAditi to Krishn\xcc\x81a, and praises him. He liberates the princesses made captive\nby Naraka, sends them to Dwaraka, and goes to Swarga with Satyabhama.\n\n\xc5\x9aAKRA, the lord of the three worlds, came mounted on his fierce elephant\nAiravata to visit \xc5\x9aauri (Krishn\xcc\x81a) at Dwaraka. Having entered the city, and\nbeen welcomed by Hari, he related to the hero the deeds of the demon Naraka.\n"By thee, Madhusudana, lord of the gods," said Indra, "in a mortal condition,\nall sufferings have been soothed. Arisht\xcc\x81a, Dhenuka, Chan\xcc\x81ura, Musht\xcc\x81ika,\nKe\xc5\x9bin, who sought to injure helpless man, have all been slain by thee. Kansa,\nKuvalayapid\xcc\x81a, the child-destroying Putana, have been killed by thee; and so\nhave other oppressors of the world. By thy valour and wisdom the three worlds\nhave been preserved, and the gods, obtaining their share of the sacrifices\noffered by the devout, enjoy satisfaction. But now hear the occasion on which\nI have come to thee, and which thou art able to remedy. The son of the earth\n1, called Naraka, who rules over the city of Pragjyotisha 2, inflicts a great\ninjury upon all creatures. Carrying off the maidens of gods, saints, demons,\nand kings, he shuts them up in his own palace. He has taken away the umbrella\nof Varun\xcc\x81a, impermeable to water, the jewel mountain crest of Mandara, and the\ncelestial nectar-dropping earrings of my mother Aditi; and he now demands my\nelephant Airavata. I have thus explained to you, Govinda, the tyranny of the\nAsura; you can best determine how it is to be prevented."\n\nHaving heard this account, the divine Hari gently smiled, and, rising from his\nthrone, took Indra by the hand: then wishing for the eater of\n\np. 582\n\nthe serpents, Garud\xcc\x81a immediately appeared; upon whom his master, having first\nseated Satyabhama upon his back, ascended, and flew to Pragjyotisha. Indra\nmounted his elephant, and, in the sight of the inhabitants of Dwaraka, went to\nthe abode of the gods.\n\nThe environs of Pragjyotisha were defended by nooses, constructed by the demon\nMuru, the edges of which were as sharp as razors; but Hari, throwing his\ndiscus Sudar\xc5\x9bana amongst them, cut them to pieces. Then Muni started up, but\nKe\xc5\x9bava slew him, and burnt his seven thousand sons, like moths, with the flame\nof the edge of his discus. Having slain Mum, Hayagriva, and Panchajana, the\nwise Hari rapidly reached the city of Pragjyotisha: there a fierce conflict\ntook place with the troops of Naraka, in which Govinda destroyed thousands of\ndemons; and when Naraka came into the field, showering upon the deity all\nsorts of weapons, the wielder of the discus, and annihilator of the demon\ntribe, cut him in two with his celestial missile. Naraka being slain, Earth,\nbearing the two earrings of Aditi, approached the lord of the world, and said,\n"When, O lord, I was upheld by thee in the form of a boar, thy contact then\nengendered this my son. He whom thou gayest me has now been killed by thee:\ntake therefore these two earrings, and cherish his progeny. Thou, lord, whose\naspect is ever gracious, hast come to this sphere, in a portion of thyself, to\nlighten my burden. Thou art the eternal creator, preserver, and destroyer of\nthe universe; the origin of all worlds, and one with the universe: what praise\ncan be worthily offered to thee? Thou art the pervader, and that which is\npervaded; the act, the agent, and the effect; the universal spirit of all\nbeings: what praise can be worthily offered to thee? Thou art the abstract\nsoul, the sentient and the living soul of all beings, the imperishable: but\nsince it is not possible to praise thee worthily, then why should the hopeless\nattempt proceed? Have compassion, O universal soul, and forgive the sins which\nNaraka has committed. Verily it is for the sanctification of thy son that he\nhas been killed by thee." The lord, who is the substance of all creatures,\nhaving replied to the earth, "Even so," proceeded to redeem the various gems\nfrom the dwelling of Naraka. In the apartments of the women he found sixteen\nthousand and one hundred\n\np. 583\n\ndamsels 3: he also beheld in the palace six thousand large elephants, each\nhaving four tusks; twenty-one lakhs of horses of Kamboja and other excellent\nbreeds: these Govinda dispatched to Dwaraka, in charge of the servants of\nNaraka. The umbrella of Varun\xcc\x81a, the jewel mountain, which he also recovered,\nhe placed upon Garud\xcc\x81a; and mounting him himself, and taking Satyabhama with\nhim, he set off to the heaven of the gods, to restore the earrings of Aditi 4.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[581:1](vp146.htm#fr_1546) By Vishn\xcc\x81u, as the Varaha Avatara; but found and\nadopted by Janaka.
