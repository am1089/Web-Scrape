It is true, that it, has never commanded anything like\nthat unbounded veneration which has always been paid in India to the\nBhagavadgita. Still it is sometimes studied even in our days, and it has had\nthe high distinction of being commented on by the great leader of the modern\nVedantic school-- _S_ a _n_ kara _k_ arya 2. The Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra\npurports to be a dialogue mainly between Sanatsu _g_ ata on the one side and\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra on the other. Sanatsu _g_ ata, from whom it takes its\nname, is said to be identical with Sanatkumara, a name not unfamiliar to\nstudents of our Upanishad literature. And Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra is the old\nfather of those Kauravas who formed one of the belligerent parties in the\nbellum plusquam civile which is recorded in the Mahabharata. The connexion of\nthis particular episode with the main current of the narrative of that epos is\none of the loosest possible character--much looser, for instance, than that of\nthe Bhagavadgita. As regards the latter, it can fairly be contended that it is\nin accordance with poetical justice for Ar _g_ una to feel despondent and\nunwilling to engage in battle, after actual sight of \'teachers, fathers,\nsons,\' and all the rest of them, arrayed in opposition to him; and that\ntherefore it was necessary for the poet to adduce some specific explanation as\nto how Ar _g_ una was ultimately enabled to get over such natural scruples.\nBut as regards the Sanatsu _g_ atiya, even such a contention as this can have\n\np. 136\n\nno place. For this is how the matter stands. In the course of the negotiations\nfor an amicable arrangement 1 between the Pa _nd_ avas and the Kauravas, Sa\xc3\xb1\n_g_ aya, on one occasion, came back to Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra with a message\nfrom the Pandavas. When he saw Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra, however, he said that he\nwould deliver the message in the public assembly of the Kauravas the next\nmorning, and went away after pronouncing a severe censure on Dh _ri_ tarash\n_t_ ra for his conduct. The suspense thus caused was a source of much vexation\nto the old man, and so he sent for Vidura, in order, as he expresses it, that\nVidura might by his discourse assuage the fire that was raging within him.\nVidura accordingly appears, and enters upon an elaborate prelection concerning\nmatters spiritual, or, perhaps, more accurately quasi-spiritual, and at the\noutset of the Sanatsu _g_ atiya he is supposed to have reached a stage where,\nas being born a _S_ udra, he hesitates to proceed. After some discussion of\nthis point, between Vidura and Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra, it is determined to call\nin the aid of Sanatsu _g_ ata, to explain the spiritual topics which Vidura\nfelt a delicacy in dealing with; and Sanatsu _g_ ata is accordingly introduced\non the scene in a way not unusual in our epic and pura _n_ ic literature, viz.\nby Vidura engaging in some mystic process of meditation, in response to which\nSanatsu _g_ ata appears. He is received then with all due formalities, and\nafter he has had some rest, as our poem takes care to note, he is catechised\nby Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra; and with one or two exceptions, all the verses which\nconstitute the Sanatsu _g_ atiya are Sanatsu _g_ ata\'s answers to Dh _ri_\ntarash _t_ ra\'s questions 2.\n\nThis brief statement of the scheme of this part of the Mahabharata shows, as\nalready pointed out, that the connexion of the Sanatsu _g_ atiya with the\ncentral story of that epic is very loose indeed; and that it might have been\nentirely omitted without occasioning any aesthetical or other defect. And\ntherefore, although there is nothing positive\n\np. 137\n\ntending to prove the Sanatsu _g_ atiya to be a later addition to the original\nepos, still the misgivings which are often entertained upon such points may\nwell, in this case, be stronger than in the case of the Bhagavadgita. The\ntext, too, of the Sanatsu _g_ atiya is not preserved in nearly so satisfactory\na condition as that of the Gita. I have had before me, in settling my text,\nthe editions of the Mahabharata respectively printed and published at Bombay\n1, Calcutta, and Madras, and three MSS., one of which was most kindly and\nreadily placed at my disposal by my friend Professor Ramk _ri_ sh _n_ a Gopa\n_l_ Bha _nd_ arkar; the second by another friend, Professor \xc3\x82ba _g_ i Vish _n_\nu Kathava _t_ e; and the third was a copy made for me at Sagar in the Central\nProvinces, through the good offices of a third friend, Mr. Vaman Mahadeva\nKolha _t_ kar. The copy lent me by Professor Bhandarkar comes from Pu _n_ a,\nand that lent by Professor Kathava _t_ e also from Pu _n_ a. This last, as\nwell as the Sagar copy, and the edition printed at Madras, contains the\ncommentary of Sa _n_ kara _k_ arya. And the text I have adopted is that which\nis indicated by the commentary as the text which its author had before him.\nBut the several copies of the commentary differ so, much from one another,\nthat it is still a matter of some doubt with me, whether I have got accurately\nthe text which _S_ a _n_ kara commented upon. For instance, the Sagar copy\nentirely omits chapter V, while the other copies not only give the text of\nthat chapter, but also a commentary upon it which calls itself Sa _n_ kara _k_\narya\'s commentary 2. Again, take the stanzas which stand within brackets at\npp. [167](sbe0824.htm#page_167), [168](sbe0824.htm#page_168) 3 of our\ntranslation. There is in none of the copies we have, any commentary of Sa _n_\nkara _k_ arya on them. And yet the stanzas exist in the text of the\nMahabharata as given in those copies which do contain _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\ncommentary. The matter is evidently one for further investigation. I have not,\nhowever, thought it absolutely\n\np. 138\n\nnecessary to make such an investigation for the purposes of the present\ntranslation. But to be on the safe side, I have retained in the translation\neverything which is to be found in those copies of the Sanatsu _g_ atiya which\nalso contain _S_ a _n_ kara\'s commentary. As to other stanzas--and there are\nsome of this description--which other MSS. or commentators vouch for, but of\nwhich no trace is to be found in the MSS. containing _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\ncommentary 1, I have simply omitted them.\n\nThese facts show that, in the case of the Sanatsu _g_ atiya, the materials for\na trustworthy historical account of the work are not of a very satisfactory\ncharacter. The materials for ascertaining its date and position in Sanskrit\nliterature are, indeed, so scanty, that poor as we have seen the materials for\nthe Bhagavadgita to be, they must be called superlatively rich as compared\nwith those we have now to deal with. As regards external evidence on the\npoints now alluded to, the first and almost the last fact falling under that\nhead, is the fact of the work being quoted from and commented upon by Sa _n_\nkara _k_ arya. In his commentary on the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad 2, _S_ a\n_n_ kara cites the passage about the flamingo at [p.\n189](sbe0826.htm#page_189), introducing it with the words, \'And in the Sanatsu\n_g_ ata also.\' In the same 3 commentary, some other passages from the Sanatsu\n_g_ atiya are also quoted, but without naming the work except as a Sm _ri_ ti,\nand mixing up together verses from different parts of the work.\n\nThis is really all the external evidence, that I am aware of, touching the\ndate of the Sanatsu _g_ atiya. There is, however, one other point, which it is\ndesirable to notice, though not, perhaps, so much because it is of any very\ngreat value in itself, as because it may hereafter become useful, should\nfurther research into the Mahabharata and other works yield the requisite.\ninformation. There are, then, eight stanzas in the thirty-sixth, thirty-\nseventh, thirty-ninth, and fortieth chapters of the Udyoga Parvan of the\nMahabharata (the Sanatsu _g_ atiya commencing at the forty-first\n\np. 139\n\nchapter), seven of which are quoted in the Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ atantra 1, and the eighth\nin the Mahabhashya 2 of Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali. Of course, it almost goes without\nsaying, that neither the Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ atantra nor the Mahabhashya mentions the\nsource from which they derive the verses in question. But I do not think it\nunallowable to make the provisional assumption, that they were derived from\nthe Mahabharata, so long as we cannot produce any other, and more likely,\nsource. It is true, that Professor Weber has, in another connexion, impugned\nthe cogency of this argument. He seems to think, that the probability--in the\ncase he was actually dealing with--of the Ramayana having borrowed from the\nMahabhashya, is quite as strong as the probability of the Mahabhashya having\nborrowed from the Ramaya _n_ a 3. And doubtless, he would by parity of reason\ncontend, in the case before us, that the probabilities, as between the\nMahabharata on the one hand, and the Mahabhashya and the Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ atantra on\nthe other, bear the same mutual relation. I cannot accept this view. I am not\nnow concerned to discuss the merits of the conclusion in support of which\nProfessor Weber has advanced this argument 4. I am only considering, how far\nit affects the question now before us. And as to that question, I may say,\nthat the Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ atantra expressly introduces the stanzas now under\nconsideration with some such expression as, \'For it has been said,\' indicating\nclearly that it was there quoting the words of another. And so, too, does the\nMahabhashya, where the passage we refer to runs as follows: \'(It is) laid\ndown, (that there is) a sin in one of tender age not rising to\n\np. 140\n\nreceive (an elderly person), and (that there is) merit in rising to receive.\nHow? Thus, "The life-winds of a youth depart upwards, when an elderly man\napproaches (him). By rising to receive (him), and salutation, he obtains them\nagain."\' It appears to me, that the indications of this being a quotation in\nthe Bhashya are very strong. But apart from that, I do demur to the\nproposition, that the probabilities are equal, of a work like the Mahabharata\nor Ramayana borrowing a verse from the Mahabhashya, and vice versa. It appears\nto me perfectly plain, I own, that the probability of a grammatical work like\nthe Bhashya borrowing a verse from a standard work like the Bharata or Ramaya\n_n_ a for purposes of illustration is very much the stronger of the two. And\nthis, quite independently of any inquiry as to whether the Bhashya does or\ndoes not show other indications of acquaintance with the Bharata or the Ramaya\n_n_ a.\n\nIf these arguments are correct, it seems to me that they carry us thus far in\nour present investigation--namely, that we may now say, that we have reason to\nbelieve some parts, at all events, of the thirty-sixth, thirty-seventh,\nthirty-eighth, and fortieth chapters of the Udyoga Parvan of the Mahabharata\nto have probably been in existence prior to the sixth century A. C. 1; and\nthat some parts of the thirty-seventh chapter were probably extant in the time\nof Pata\xc3\xb1gali, viz. the second century B. C. 2 Now, internal evidence does not\nyield any indications tending to show that the several chapters here referred\nto must have been prior in time to the chapters composing the Sanatsu _g_\natiya, which come so soon after them in the Mahabharata. On the contrary, it\nis, not too much to maintain, that to a certain extent the style and language\nof the Sanatsu _g_ atiya is, if anything, rather indicative of its priority in\ntime over the five chapters immediately preceding it. And, therefore, so far\nas this argument goes, it enables us--provisionally only, it must be\nremembered--to fix the second century B.C. as a terminus ad quem for the date\nof the Sanatsu _g_ atiya.\n\nThis is all the external evidence available for a discussion\n\np. 141\n\nof the question--when the Sanatsu _g_ atiya was composed. We now turn to the\ninternal evidence. Standing by itself, internal evidence is not, in my\nopinion, of much cogency in any case. Still in ascertaining, as best we can,\nthe history of our ancient literature, even this species of evidence is not to\nbe despised; it must only be used and received with caution. Under this head,\nthen, we may note first the persons who are supposed to take part in the\ndialogue. Sanatsu _g_ ata 1\\--or Sanatkumara--as already pointed out, is a\nname already familiar to the readers of one of our older Upanishads--the _Kh_\nandogya. Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra is not known in the Upanishads, but he is an\nimportant personage in the epic literature. And it is to be remarked, that his\ncharacter as disclosed in the Sanatsu _g_ atiya is not at all similar to that\nwhich has attached itself to his name, alike in the later literature of our\ncountry, and in that popular opinion which was probably formed by this later\nliterature. In the dialogue before us, he figures as an earnest inquirer after\ntruth; he is described as the \'talented king Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra;\' and is\naddressed by Sanatsu _g_ ata as, \'O acute sir!\' \'O learned person!\' True it\nis, that Nilaka _nth_ a in one place, as we have noticed in our note there 2,\nendeavours to bring out the later view of Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra\'s character 3;\nbut it seems to me that that endeavour, based as it is on a forced and\nfarfetched interpretation of a single word in our poem, is an unsuccessful\none. None of the questions, which Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra puts to Sanatsu _g_\nata in the course of their dialogue, indicates the avaricious old man who\nwished to deprive his innocent nephews of their just rights in the interests\nof his own wicked and misguided sons. They rather indicate the bona fide\nstudent of spiritual lore, and thus point to what is, perhaps, an earlier view\nof Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra\'s character.\n\nIf we look next to the general style of this poem, we find that it has none of\nthat elaboration which marks what I\n\np. 142\n\nhave called the age of Kavyas and Na _t_ akas. The remarks on this topic in\nthe Introduction to the Gita apply pretty accurately to this work also. We\nobserve here the same paucity of long-drawn compounds, the same absence of\nmerely ornamental adjectives, the same absence of figures and tropes 1; in one\nword, the same directness and simplicity of style. Furthermore, there is a\nsomewhat greater want of finish about the syntax of our poem than there is\neven in the Gita. Such constructions as we find _inter alia_ at chapter II,\nstanza 2, or 25, or at chapter III, stanza 14, or chapter IV, stanza 12, or in\nthe early verses of the last chapter, indicate a period in the history of the\nlanguage, when probably the regulations of syntax were not quite thoroughly\nestablished in practice.\n\nIf we turn to the metre of the poem, an analogous phenomenon strikes us there.\nSimilar irregularities in the collocation of long and short syllables, similar\nsuperfluities and deficiencies of syllables, meet us in the Sanatsu _g_ atiya\nand the Bhagavadgita. And in the former work, as in the latter, the\nirregularities are less observable in the Anush _t_ ubh 2 than in the other\nmetres used. Probably the explanation, apart from the great elasticity of that\nmetre, is that the Anush _t_ ubh had been more used, and had in consequence\nbecome comparatively more settled in its scheme even in practical composition.\n\nLooking now more particularly to the language of the work before us, we find\none word to be of most frequent occurrence, namely, the word vai, which we\nhave rendered \'verily.\' It is not a common word in the later literature, while\nin the Upanishad literature we meet with great frequency, not merely vai, but\nthe words, which I think are cognate with it, va and vava. The former word,\nindeed, appears to me to stand in some passages of the Upanishads for vai by\neuphonic alterations. Thus in the passage tva _m\n\n_\n\np. 143\n\nva aham asmi bhagavo devate, aha _m_ vai tvam asi, it is difficult not to\nsuppose that the va of the first part of the sentence is the same word as the\nvai of the second part, only altered according to the rules of Sandhi in\nSanskrit.\n\nA second point of similarity between the language of the Upanishads and that\nof the Sanatsu _g_ atiya is to be found in the phrase, \'He who knows this\nbecomes immortal.\' This sentence, or one of like signification, is, as is well\nknown, of common occurrence in the Upanishads and in the Brahma _n_ as. In the\nBhagavadgita, the verses towards the end, which come after K _ri_ sh _n_ a\'s\nsumming-up of his instruction, seem to be of a somewhat analogous, though in\nsome respects different, nature. And in the Pura _n_ as we meet sometimes with\nelaborate passages extolling the merits of a particular rite, or a particular\npilgrimage, and so forth. This form of the Phala _s_ ruti, as it is called,\nappears to have been developed in process of time from the minute germ\nexisting in the Brahma _n_ as and the Upanishads. In the Sanatsu _g_ atiya,\nhowever, we are almost at the beginning of those developments; indeed, the\nform before us is identically the same as that which we see in the works where\nit is first met with. It is a short sentence, which, though complete in\nitself, still appears merely at the end of another passage, and almost as a\npart of such other passage.\n\nThere is one other point of a kindred nature which it may be well to notice\nhere. As in the Gita, so in the Sanatsu _g_ atiya, we meet with a considerable\nnumber of words used in senses not familiar in the later literature. They are\ncollected in the Index of Sanskrit words in this volume; but a few remarks on\nsome of them will not, it is thought, be entirely out of place here. The word\nmarga 1\\--in the sense of \'worldly life\'--is rather remarkable. _S_ a _n_ kara\nrenders it by \'the path of sa _m_ sara\' or worldly life, And he quotes as a\nparallel the passage from the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad which speaks of returning\nto the \'path.\' There, however, _S_ a _n_ kara explains it to mean the \'path by\nwhich\n\np. 144\n\nthe self returns to worldly life,\' namely, from space to the wind and so forth\ninto vegetables, and food, ultimately appearing as a f\xc2\x9ctus. Another remarkable\nword is \'varga,\' which occurs twice in the Sanatsu _g_ atiya. _S_ a _n_ kara\nand Nilaka _nth_ a differ in their explanations of it, and Nilaka _nth_ a\nindeed gives two different meanings to the word in the two passages where it\noccurs. We may also refer here specially to utsa, _ri_ tvi _g_ , and matva. In\nBoehtlingk and Roth\'s Lexicon the only passages cited under \'utsa\' are from\nVedic works, except two respectively from Su _s_ ruta and the Da _s_ akumara\n_k_ arita. One passage, however, there cited, viz. Vish _n_ o _h_ pade parame\nmadhva utsa _h_ , is plainly the original of the passage we are now\nconsidering. As to ritvig in the sense it bears here, we see, I think, what\nwas the earlier signification of that word before it settled down into the\nsomewhat technical meaning in which it is now familiar. And matva in the sense\nof \'meditating upon\' is to be found in the Upanishads, but not, I think, in\nany work of the classical literature. These words, therefore, seem to indicate\nthat the Sanatsu _g_ atiya was composed at a stage in the development of the\nSanskrit language which is a good deal earlier than the stage which we see\ncompletely reached in the classical literature.\n\nComing now to the matter of the Sanatsu _g_ atiya, it appears to me, that we\nthere see indications pointing in a general way to the same conclusion as that\nwhich we have here arrived at. There is, in the first place, a looseness and\nwant of rigid system in the mode of handling the subject, similar to that\nwhich we have already observed upon as characterising the Bhagavadgita. There\nis no obvious bond of connexion joining together the various subjects\ndiscussed, nor are those subjects themselves treated after any very scientific\nor rigorous method. Again, if the fourth chapter is a genuine part of the\nSanatsu _g_ atiya, we have an elaborate repetition, in one part, of what has\nbeen said in another part of the work, with only a few variations in words,\nand perhaps fewer still in signification. As, however, I am not at present\nprepared to stand finally by the genuineness of that chapter I do not consider\nit desirable to further labour this argument\n\np. 145\n\nthan to point out, that similar repetitions, on a smaller scale, perhaps, are\nnot uncommon in our older literature 1.\n\nComing now to the manner in which the Vedas are spoken of in the work before\nus, there are, we find, one or two noteworthy circumstances proper to be\nconsidered here. In the first place, we have the reference to the four Vedas\ntogether with \xc3\x82khyanas as the fifth Veda. This is in conformity with the old\ntradition recorded in the various works to which we have referred in our note\non the passage. The mention of the Atharva-veda, which is implied in this\npassage, and expressly contained in another, might be regarded as some mark of\na modern age. But without dwelling upon the fact, that the Atharva-veda,\nthough probably, modern as compared with the other Vedas, is still old enough\nto date some centuries before the Christian era 2, it must suffice to draw\nattention here to the fact that the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad mentions that Veda,\nand it is not here argued that the Sanatsu _g_ atiya is older than the _Kh_\nandogya-upanishad. We have next to consider the reference to the Saman hymns\nas \'vimala,\' or pure. The point involved in this reference has been already\nsufficiently discussed in the Introduction to the Gita 3; and it is not\nnecessary here to say more than that, of the two classes of works we have\nthere made, the Sanatsu _g_ atiya appears from the passage under discussion to\nrank itself with. the class which is prior in date.\n\nThe estimate of the value of the Vedas which is implied in the Sanatsu _g_\natiya appears to coincide very nearly with that which we have shown to be the\nestimate implied in the Bhagavadgita. The Vedas are not here cast aside as\nuseless any more than they are in the Bhagavadgita. For, I do not think the\nword An _ri_ kas which occurs in one passage of the work can be regarded\nreally as referring to those who entirely reject the Vedic revelation. Without\ngoing as far as that, the Sanatsu _g_ atiya seems certainly to join the\nBhagavadgita in its protest against those men of extreme views, who could see\nnothing beyond the rites and ceremonies\n\np. 146\n\ntaught in the Vedas. A study of the Vedas is, indeed, insisted on in sundry\npassages of the Sanatsu _g_ atiya. But it is equally maintained, that the\nperformance of the ceremonies laid down in the Vedas is not the true means of\nfinal emancipation. It is maintained, that action done with any desire is a\ncause of bondage to worldly life; that the gods themselves are ordinary\ncreatures who have reached a certain high position owing to the practice of\nthe duties of Brahma _k_ arins, but that they are not only not superior to,\nbut are really under the control of, the man who has acquired the true\nknowledge of the universal self. On all these points, we have opinions\nexpressed in the Sanatsu _g_ atiya, which conclusively establish an identity\nof doctrine as between the Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita 1 on the one hand,\nand the Sanatsu _g_ atiya on the other. Lastly, we have an explicit statement,\nthat the mere study of Vedic texts avails nothing, and that sin is not to be\ngot rid of by one who merely \'studies the _Rik_ and the Ya _g_ us texts, and\nthe Sama-veda.\' It is not necessary to repeat here the chronological\ndeductions which may be based upon this relation between the Sanatsu _g_ atiya\nand the Vedas. We have already argued in the Introduction to the Bhagavadgita,\nthat such a relation points to a period of Indian religious history prior to\nthe great movement of Gautama Buddha 2.\n\nThere is, however, this difference, perhaps, to be noted between the Gita and\nthe Sanatsu _g_ atiya-namely, that the latter work seems to afford more\ncertain indications of the recognition, at the date of its composition, of a\n_G_ \xc3\xb1anaka _nd_ a as distinguished from a Karmaka _nd_ a in the Vedas, than,\nwe have seen, are contained in the Bhagavadgita 3. The passage, for instance,\nwhich speaks of the _Kh_ andas as referring \'of themselves\' to the Brahman,\nand the passage which refers to an understanding of the Brahman by means of\nthe Vedas, according to the principle of the moon and the branch--these seem\nrather to point to a portion of the Vedas which was regarded as giving\ninstruction in true\n\np. 147\n\nknowledge, as distinguished from merely laying down various sacrifices and\nceremonials for special purposes. In fact, in one passage we have the germ of\nthe whole Vedantic theory as afterwards settled. For there we are told, that\nsacrifices and penances are laid down as the preliminary steps towards the\nacquisition of true knowledge. By those sacrifices one is purified of one\'s\nsins, and then acquires a. knowledge of the supreme self as described in the\nVedas--which, I apprehend, must mean the Upanishads.\n\nThere is but one other point on which we need say anything further. And that\nis connected with the definition of a Brahma _n_ a. That definition appears to\nme, to point to an earlier stage in religious progress than is indicated in\n\xc3\x82pastamba and Manu. The true Brahma _n_ a is he who is attached to the\nBrahman. Perhaps, this marks some little advance beyond the more general\ndoctrine of the Gita, but it is still very far short of the petrified\ndoctrine, if I may so call it, of the later law-givers. The Brahma _n_ a has\nnot yet degenerated into the mere receiver of fees and presents, but is still\nin possession of the truth.\n\nWe thus see, that the external and internal evidence bearing upon the question\nof the position of the Sanatsu _g_ atiya in Sanskrit literature, seems to\npoint to nearly the same period and place for it as for the Bhagavadgita. It\nis plain enough, that the evidence under both heads is extremely scanty and\nmeagre. But such as it is, it appears to us to justify a provisional\nconclusion, that the Sanatsu _g_ atiya dates from a period prior to the rise\nof Buddhism, and forms part of that same movement in the religious history of\nancient India of which the Gita is another embodiment. More than this, we are\nnot at present in a position to assert. To this extent, the evidence enables\nus, I think, to go. And we accordingly hold, that unless other and further\nevidence requires a reversal of this judgment, the Sanatsu _g_ atiya may be\ntreated as a work nearly contemporary with the Bhagavadgita, and occupying\ngenerally the same point of view.\n\nOne word, finally, about the translation. As stated already, the text adopted\nis that which appears to have\n\np. 148\n\nbeen before _S_ a _n_ kara _k_ arya. And the translation follows mainly his\ninterpretations in his commentary. Sometimes we have followed Nilaka _nth_ a,\nwhose commentary has been consulted as well as a very incorrect copy of\nanother commentary by one Sarva _g_ \xc3\xb1a Naraya _n_ a, contained in the MS. from\nPuna lent me by Professor Bha _nd_ arkar. In some places even the commentators\nhave failed to clear up obscurities, and there we have given the best\ntranslation we could suggest, indicating the difficulties. There has been an\nendeavour made here, as in the case of the Bhagavadgita, to keep the\ntranslation as close and faithful to the text as the exigencies of the English\nlanguage permitted. \'The exegetical notes are mostly taken from the\ncommentaries, even where the name of the commentator is not specified; while\nthe references to parallel passages have been collected, mostly by myself, in\nthe same way as in the case of the Bhagavadgita.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[135:1](sbe0821.htm#fr_580) Mahabharata, Udyoga Parvan, Adhyaya 41-46.\n\n[135:2](sbe0821.htm#fr_581) Madhava _k_ arya, in speaking of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\nworks, describes him as having commented on the Sanatsu _g_ atiya, which is\n\'far from evil (persons)\' [asatsudura _m_ ]. _S_ a _n_ kara-vi _g_ aya,\nchapter VI, stanza 62.\n\n[136:1](sbe0821.htm#fr_582) See [p. 3](sbe0802.htm#page_3) supra.\n\n[136:2](sbe0821.htm#fr_583) After this dialogue is over, the dawn breaks, and\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra and the Kaurava princes meet in general assembly.\n\n[137:1](sbe0821.htm#fr_584) This contains Nilaka _nth_ a\'s commentary, but his\ntext avowedly includes the text of _S_ a _n_ kara, and verses and readings\ncontained in more modern copies.\n\n[137:2](sbe0821.htm#fr_585) The commentary on the sixth chapter, however,\ntakes up the thread from the end of the fourth chapter.\n\n[137:3](sbe0821.htm#fr_586) See [p. 182](sbe0825.htm#page_182), where one of\nthe lines recurs.\n\n[138:1](sbe0821.htm#fr_587) See note , p. 137.\n\n[138:2](sbe0821.htm#fr_588) [p. 283](sbe0838.htm#page_283).\n\n[138:3](sbe0821.htm#fr_589) p. 252.

The parallel from\nMadhava which Professor Weber adduces is quite inconclusive, and as far as it\ngoes appears to me to militate against the Professor\'s own view.\n\n[139:4](sbe0821.htm#fr_593) I may, however, admit at once, that I ought not to\nhave expressed myself as strongly as I did in the note which Professor Weber\ncriticises.\n\n[140:1](sbe0821.htm#fr_594) See [p. 29](sbe0802.htm#page_29) supra.\n\n[140:2](sbe0821.htm#fr_595) See [p. 32](sbe0802.htm#page_32) supra.\n\n[141:1](sbe0821.htm#fr_596) See Hall\'s Sa _n_ khyasara, preface, pp. 14, 15.\n\n[141:2](sbe0821.htm#fr_597) P.

That question does not occur in _S_ a _n_ kara\'s text,\nbut is given at [p. 158](sbe0823.htm#page_158) infra.\n\n[142:1](sbe0821.htm#fr_599) The five similes which occur, and which are nearly\nall that occur, in the poem, are the very primitive ones--of the hunter, of\nwater on grass, the tiger of straw, death eating men like a tiger, dogs eating\nwhat is vomited, a branch of a tree and the moon, and birds and their nests.\n\n[142:2](sbe0821.htm#fr_600) Cf. as to this the N _ri_ si _m_ ha Tapini, p.\n105.\n\n[143:1](sbe0821.htm#fr_601) I give no references here, as they can be found in\nthe Index of Sanskrit words at the end of this volume.\n\n[145:1](sbe0821.htm#fr_602) See [p. 181](sbe0825.htm#page_181), note infra.\n\n[145:2](sbe0821.htm#fr_603) P.
