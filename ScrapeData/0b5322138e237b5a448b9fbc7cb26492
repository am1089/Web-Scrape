He said,\n\'The boy is free to go, but I don\'t see how he is to live in any other part of\nthe world, for he is too stupid to earn his living, and I will give him no\nmoney to squander on senseless pleasures.\' Then the Ranee told her son that he\nhad his father\'s permission to travel, and said to him, \'You are going out\ninto the world now to try your luck; take with you the food and clothes I have\nprovided for your journey.\' And she gave him a bundle of clothes and several\nsmall loaves, and in each loaf she placed a gold mohur, that on opening it he\nmight find money as well as food inside; and he started on his journey.\n\nWhen the young Rajah had travelled a long way, and left his father\'s kingdom\nfar behind, he one day came upon the outskirts of a great city, where (instead\nof taking the position due to his rank, and sending to inform the Rajah of his\narrival) he went to a poor Carpenter\'s house and begged of him a lodging for\nthe night. The Carpenter was busy making wooden clogs in the porch of his\nhouse, but be looked up and nodded, saying, \'Young man, you are welcome to any\nassistance a stranger may need and we can give. If you are in want of food,\nyou will find my wife and daughter in he house--they will be happy to cook for\nyou.\' The Rajah went inside, and said to the Carpenter\'s daughter, \'I am a\nstranger, and have travelled a long way; I am both tired and hungry: cook me\nsome dinner as fast as you can, and I will pay you for your trouble.\' She\nanswered, \'I would willingly cook you some dinner at once, but I have no wood\nto light the fire, and the jungle is some way off.--" It matters not,\' said\nthe Rajah, \'this will do to light the fire, and I\'ll make the loss good to\nyour father.\' And taking a pair of new clogs which the Carpenter had just\nfinished making, he broke them up, and lighted the fire with them.\n\nNext morning he went into the jungle, cut wood, and having made a pair of new\nclogs,--better than those with which he had lighted the fire the evening\nbefore,--placed them with the rest of the goods for sale in the Carpenter\'s\nshop. Shortly afterwards one of the Rajah of that country\'s servants came to\nbuy a pair of clogs for his master, and seeing these new ones, said to the\nCarpenter, \'Why, man, these clogs are better than all the rest put together. I\nwill take none other to the Rajah. I wish you would always make such clogs as\nthese.\' And throwing down ten gold mohurs  1 on the floor of the hut, he took\nup the clogs and went away.\n\nThe Carpenter was much surprised at the whole business. In the first place, he\nusually received only two or three rupees  2 for each pair of clogs; and in\nthe second, he knew that those which the Rajah\'s servant had judged worth ten\ngold mohurs had not been made by him; and, how they had come there he could\nnot think, for he felt certain they were not with the rest of the clogs the\nnight before. He thought and thought, but the more he thought about the\nmatter, the more puzzled he got, and he went to talk about it to his wife and\ndaughter. Then his daughter said, \'Oh, those must have been the clogs the\nstranger made!\' And she told her father how he had lighted the fire the night\nbefore with two of the clogs which were for sale, and had afterwards fetched\nwood from the jungle and made another pair to replace them.\n\nThe Carpenter at this news was more astonished than ever, and he thought to\nhimself, \'Since this stranger seems a quiet, peaceable sort of man, and can\nmake clogs so well, it is a great pity he should leave this place--he would\nmake a good husband for my daughter;\' and, catching hold of the young Rajah,\nhe propounded his scheme to him. (But all this time he had no idea that his\nguest was a Rajah.)\n\nNow the Carpenter\'s daughter was a very pretty girl--as pretty as any Ranee\nyou ever saw; she was also good-tempered, clever and could cook extremely\nwell. So when the Carpenter asked the Rajah to be his son-in-law, he looked at\nthe father, the mother and the girl, and thinking to himself that many a\nbetter man had a worse fate, he said, \'Yes, I will marry your daughter, and\nstay here and make clogs.\' So the Rajah married the Carpenter\'s daughter.\n\nThis Rajah was very clever at making all sorts of things in wood. When he had\nmade all the clogs he wished to sell next day, he would amuse himself in\nmaking toys; and in this way ht made a thousand wooden parrots. They were as\nlike real parrots as possible. They had each two wings, two legs, two eyes,\nand a sharp beak. And when the Rajah had finished them all, he painted and\nvarnished them, and put them one afternoon outside the house to dry.\n\nNight came on, and with it came Parbuttee and Mahadeo, 3 flying round the\nworld to see the different races of men. Amongst the many places they visited\nwas the city where the Carpenter lived and in the garden in front of the house\nthey saw the thousand wooden parrots which the Rajah had made and painted and\nvarnished, all placed out to dry. Then Parbuttee turned to Mahadeo and said,\n\'These parrots are very well made--they need nothing but life. Why should not\nwe give them life?\' Mahadeo answered, \'What would be the use of that? It would\nbe a strange freak indeed!\' \'Oh,\' said Parbuttee, \'I only meant you to do it\nas an amusement. It would be so funny to see the wooden parrots flying about I\nBut do not do it if you don\'t like.\' \'You would like it, then?\' answered\nMahadeo; \'very well, I will do it.\' And he endowed the thousand parrots with\nlife.\n\nParbuttee and Mahadeo then flew away.\n\nNext morning the Rajah got up early to see if the varnish he had put on the\nwooden parrots was dry; but no sooner did hc open the door than--marvel of\nmarvels!--the thousand wooden parrots all came walking into the house,\nflapping their wings and chattering to each other.\n\nHearing the noise, the Carpenter and the Carpenter\'s wife and daughter came\nrunning out to see what was the matter, and wert not less astonished than the\nRajah himself at the miracle which had taken place. Then the Carpenter\'s wife\nturned to her son-in. law, and said, \'It is all very well that you should have\nmade thes wooden parrots; but I don\'t know where we are to find food for them\nI great strong parrots like these will eat not less than a pound of rice\napiece every day. Your father-in-law and I cannot afford to procure as much as\nthat for them in this poor house. II you wish to keep them, you must live\nelsewhere, for we cannot provide for you all.\'\n\n\'Very well,\' said the Rajah; \'you shall not have cause to accuse me of ruining\nyou, for from henceforth I will have a house of my own.\' So he and his wife\nwent to live in a house of their own, and he took the thousand parrots with\nhim, and his mother. in-law gave her daughter some corn, and rice, and money\nto begin housekeeping with. He soon found that the parrots, instead of being\nan expense, were the means of increasing his fortune; for they flew away every\nmorning early to get food, and spent the whole day out in the fields; and\nevery evening, when they returned home, each parrot brought in his beak a\nstalk of corn, or rice, or whatever it had found, good to eat. So that their\nmaster was regularly supplied with more food than enough; and what with\nselling what he did not require, and working at his trade, he soon became\nquite a rich carpenter.\n\nAfter he had been living in this way very happily for some time, one night,\nwhen he fell asleep, the Rajah dreamed a wonderful dream, and this was the\ndream.\n\nHe thought that very, very far away, beyond the Red Sea, was a beautiful\nkingdom surrounded by seven other seas; and that it belonged to a Rajah and\nRanee who had one lovely daughter named Panch-Phul Ranee (the Five Flower\nQueen), after whom the whole kingdom was called Panch-Phul Ranee\'s country;\nand that this Princess lived in the centre of her father\'s kingdom, in a\nlittle house round which were seven wide ditches, and seven great hedges made\nof spears; and that she was called Panch-Phu] Ranee, because she was so light\nand delicate, that she weighed no more than five white lotus-flowers!\nMoreover, he dreamed that this Princess had vowed to marry no one who could\nnot cross the seven seas; and jump the seven ditches, and seven hedges made of\nspears.\n\nAfter dreaming this, the young Rajah awoke, and feeling much puzzled, got up,\nand sitting with his head in his hands, tried to think the matter over, and\ndiscover if he had ever heard anything \'ike his dream before; but he could\nmake nothing of it.\n\nWhilst he was thus thinking, his wife awoke, and asked him what was the\nmatter. He told her, and she said, \'That is a strange dream. If I were you,\nI\'d ask the old parrot about it; he is a wise bird, and perhaps he knows.\'\nThis parrot of which she spoke was the most wise of all the thousand wooden\nparrots. The Rajah took his wife\'s advice, and when all the birds came home\nthat evening, he called the old parrot, and told him his dream, saying, \'Can\nthis be true?\' To which the parrot replied, \'It is all true. The Panch-Phul\nRanee\'s country lies beyond the Red Sea, and is surrounded by seven seas, and\nshe dwells in a house built in the centre of her father\'s kingdom. Round her\nhouse are seven ditches and seven hedges made of spears, and she has vowed not\nto marry any man who cannot jump these seven ditches and seven hedges; and\nbecause she is very beautiful many great and noble men have tried to do this,\nbut in vain.\n\n\'The Rajab and Ranee, her father and mother, are very fond of her, and proud\nof her. Every day she goes to the palace to see them, and they weigh her in a\npair of scales. They put her in one scale, and five lotus-flowers in the\nother, and she is so delicate and fragile, she weighs no heavier than the five\nlittle flowers, so they call her the Panch-Phul Ranee. Her father and mother\nare very proud of this.\'\n\n\'I should like to go to that country and see the Panch-Phul Ranee,\' said the\nRajah; \'but I don\'t know how I could cross the seven seas.\'--\' I will show you\nhow to manage that,\' replied the old parrot. \'I and another parrot will fly\nclose together, I cross-ing my left over his right wing; so as to move along\nas if we were one bird (using only our outside wings to fly with); you shall\nthen sit on a chair made of our interlaced wings, and we will carry you safely\nacross the seven seas. On the way, we will every evening alight in some high\ntree and rest, and every morning we can go on again.\'--\' That sounds a good\nplan; I have a great desire to try it,\' said the Rajah. \'Wife, what should you\nthink of my going to the Panch-Phul Ranee\'s country, and seeing if I can jump\nthe seven ditches and seven hedges made of spears? Will you let me try?\'\n\n\'Yes,\' she answered. \'If you like to go and marry her, go; only take care that\nyou do not kill yourself; and mind you come back some day.\' And she prepared\nfood for him to take with him, and took off her gold and silver bangles, which\nshe placed in a bundle of warm things, that he might be in need neither of\nmoney nor clothes on the Journey. He then charged the nine hundred and ninety-\neight parrots he left behind him to bring her plenty of corn and rice daily\n(that she might never need food while he was away), and took her to the house\nof her father, in whose care she was to remain during his absence; and he\nwished her good-bye, saying, \'Do not fear but that I will come back to you,\neven if I do win the Panch-Phul Ranee, for you will always be my first wife,\nthough you are the Carpenter\'s daughter.\'\n\nThe old parrot and another parrot then spread their wings, on which the Rajah\nseated himself as on a chair, and rising up in the air, they flew away with\nhim out of sight.\n\nFar, far, far, they flew, as fast as parrots can fly, over hills, over\nforests, over rivers, over valleys, on, on, on, hour after hour, day after\nday, week after week, only staying to rest every night when it got too dark to\nsee where they were going. At last they reached the seven seas which\nsurrounded the Panch-Phul Ranee\'s country. When once they began crossing the\nseas they could not rest (for there was neither rock nor island on which to\nalight), so they were obliged to fly straight across them, night and day,\nuntil they gained the shore.\n\nBy reason of this, the parrots were too exhausted on their arrival to go as\nfar as the city where the Rajah, Panch-Phul Ranee\'s father, lived, but they\nflew down to rest on a beautiful banyan-tree, which grew not far from the sea,\nclose to a small village. The Rajah determined to go into the village, and get\nfood and shelter there. He told the parrots to stay in the banyantree till his\nreturn; then, leaving his bundle of clothes, and most of his money in their\ncharge, he set off on foot towards the nearest house.\n\nAfter a little while he reached a Malee\'s cottage, and, giving a gold mohur to\nthe Malee\'s wife, got her to provide him with food and shelter for the night.\n\nNext morning he rose early, and said to his hostess,--\' I am a stranger here,\nand know nothing of the place. What is the name of your country?\'\n\n\'This,\' she said, \'is Panch-Phul Ranee\'s country.\'\n\n\'And what is the last news in your village?\' he asked.\n\n\'Very bad news indeed,\' she replied. \'You must know, our Rajab has one only\ndaughter--a most beautiful Princess--and her name is Panch-Phul Ranee; for she\nis so light and delicate, that she weighs no heavier than five lotus flowers.\nAfter her this whole country is called Panch-Phul Ranee\'s country. She lives\nin a small bungalow  4 in the centre of the city you see yonder; but,\nunluckily for us, she has vowed to marry no man who cannot jump on foot over\nthe seven hedges made of spears, and across the seven great ditches that\nsurround her house. This cannot be done. Babamah!  5 I don\'t know how many\nhundreds of thousands of Rajahs have tried to do it, and died in the attempt!\nYet the Princess will not break her vow. Daily, worse and worse tidings come\nfrom the city, of fresh people having been killed in trying to jump the seven\nhedges and seven ditches, and I see no end to the misfortunes that will arise\nfrom it. Not only are so many brave men lost to the world, but, since the\nPrincess will marry no one who does not succeed in this, she stands a chance\nof not marrying at all; and if that be so, when the Rajah dies there will be\nno one to protect her and claim the right to succeed to the throne. All the\nnobles will probably fight for the Raj, and the whole kingdom be turned topsy-\nturvy.\'\n\n\'Mai,\' said the Rajah, \'if that is all, I will try and win your Princess, for\nI can jump right well.\'\n\n\'Baba,\'  6 answered the Malee\'s wife, \'do not think of such a thing--are you\nmad? I tell you, hundreds of thousands of men have said these words before,\nand been killed in their rashness. What power do you think you possess to\nsucceed where all before you have failed? Give up all thought of this, for it\nis utter folly!\'\n\n\'I will not do it,\' answered the Rajah, \'before going to consult some of my\nfriends.\'\n\nSo he left the Malee\'s cottage, and returned to the banyantree to talk over\nthe matter with the parrots; for he thought they would be able to carry him on\ntheir wings across the seven ditches and seven hedges made of spears. When he\nreached the tree the old parrot said to him, \'It is two days since you left\nus; what news have you brought from the village?\' The Rajah answered, \'The\nPanch-Phul Ranee still lives in the house surrounded by the seven ditches and\nseven hedges made of spears, and has vowed to marry no man who cannot jump\nover them; but cannot you parrots, who brought me all the way across the seven\nseas, carry me on your wings across these great barriers?\'\n\n\'You stupid man,\' answered the old parrot, \'of course we could; but what would\nbe the good of doing so? If we carried you across, it would not be at all the\nsame thing as your jumping across, and the Princess would no more consent to\nmarry you, than she would now; for she has vowed to marry no one who has not\njumped across on fool. If you want to do the thing, why not do it yourself;\ninstead of talking nonsense? Have you forgotten how, when you were a little\nboy, you were taught to jump by conjurors and tumblers?--for the parrot knew\nall the Rajah\'s history. Now is the time to put their lessons in practice. If\nyou can jump the seven ditches and seven hedges made of spears you will have\ndone a good work, and be able to marry the Panch-Phul Ranee; but if not, this\nis a thing in which we cannot help you.\'\n\n\'You reason justly,\' replied the Rajah. \'I will try to put in practice the\nlessons I learned when a boy; meantime, do you stay here till my return.\'\n\nSo saying he went away to the city, which he reached by nightfall Next morning\nearly he went to where the Princess\'s bungalow stood, to try and jump the\nfourteen great barriers. He was strong and agile, and he jumped the seven\ngreat ditches, and six of the seven hedges made of spears; but in running to\njump the seventh hedge he hurt his foot, and stumbling, fell upon the spears\nand died,--run through and through with the cruel iron spikes.\n\nWhen Panch-Phul Ranee\'s father and mother got up that morning and looked out,\nas their custom was, towards their daughter\'s bungalow, they saw something\ntransfixed upon the seventh hedge of spears, but what it was they could not\nmake out, for it dazzled their eyes. So they called his Wuzeer, and said to\nhim, \'For some days I have seen no one attempt to jump the seven hedges and\nseven ditches round Panch-Phul Ranee\'s bungalow; but what is that which I now\nsee upon the seventh hedge of spears?\' The Wuzeer answered, \'That is a Rajah\'s\nson, who has failed like all who have gone before him.\'\n\n\'But how is it,\' asked the Rajah, \'that he thus dazzles our eyes?\'\n\n\'It is,\' replied the Wuzeer, \'because he is so beautiful. Of all that have\ndied for the sake of Panch-Phul Ranee, this youth is, beyond doubt, the\nhandsomest.\'\n\n\'Alas!\' cried the Rajah, \'how many and how many brave men has my daughter\nkilled! I will have no more die for her. Let us send her and the dead man away\ntogether into the jungle.\'\n\nHe then ordered the servants to fetch the young Rajah\'s body. There he lay,\nstill and beautiful, with a glory shining round him as the moonlight shines\nround the clear bright moon, but without a spark of life.\n\nWhen the Rajah saw him, he said, \'O pity, pity I that so brave and handsome a\nboy should have come dying after this girl. Yet he is but one of the thousands\nof thousands who have thus died to no purpose. Pull up the spears and cast\nthem into the seven ditches, for they shall remain no longer.\'\n\nThen he commanded two palanquins to be prepared, and men in readiness to carry\nthem, and said, \'Let the girl be married to the young Rajah, and let both be\ntaken far away into the jungle, that we may never see them more. Then there\nwill be quiet in the land again.\'\n\nThe Ranee, Panch-Phul Ranee\'s mother, cried bitterly at this, for she was very\nfond of her daughter, and she begged her husband not to send her away so\ncruelly--the living with the dead; but the Rajah was inexorable. \'That poor\nboy died,\' he said; \'let my daughter die too. I\'ll have no more men killed\nhere.\'\n\nSo the two palanquins were prepared. He placed his daughter in the one, and\nher dead husband in the other, and said to the palkee-bearers, \'Take these\npalkees and go out into the jungle until you have reached a place so desolate\nthat not so much as a sparrow is to be seen, and there leave them both.\'\n\nAnd so they did. Deep down in the jungle, where no bright sun could pierce the\ndarkness, nor human voice be heard, far from any habitation of man or means of\nsupporting life, on the edge of a dank, stagnant morass, that was shunned by\nall but noisome reptiles and wandering beasts of prey, they set them down and\nleft them, the dead husband and the living wife, alone to meet the horrors of\nthe coming night--alone, without a chance of rescue.\n\nPanch-Phul Ranee heard the bearers\' retreating footsteps, and their voices\ngetting fainter and fainter in the distance, and felt that she had nothing to\nhope for but death.\n\nNight seemed coming on apace, for though the sun had not set, the jungle was\nso dark that but little light pierced the gloom--and she thought she would\ntake a last look at the husband her vow had killed, and sitting beside him\nwait till starvation should make her as he was, or some wild animal put a more\nspeedy end to her sufferings.\n\nShe left her palkee and went towards his. There he lay with closed eyes and\nclose-shut lips; black curling hair, which escaped from under his turban,\nconcealed a ghastly wound on his temple. There was no look of pain on the\nface, and the long sweeping eyelashes gave it such a tender, softened\nexpression she could hardly believe that be was dead. He was, in truth, very\nbeautiful; and watching him she said to herself, \'Alas, what a noble being is\nhere lost to the world--what an earth\'s joy is extinguished! Was it for this\nthat I was cold, and proud, and stern--to break the cup of my own happiness,\nand to be the death of such as you? Must you now never learn that you won your\nwife? Must you never hear her ask your pardon for the past, nor know her cruel\npunishment? Ah, if you had but lived, how dearly I would have loved you! O my\nhusband, my husband!\' And sinking down on the ground, she buried her face in\nher hands, and cried bitterly.\n\nWhile she was sitting thus, night dosed over the jungle, and brought with it\nwild beasts that had left their dens and lairs to roam about in search of\nprey, as the heat of the day was over. Tigers, lions, elephants, and bisons,\nall came by turns crushing through the underwood which surrounded the place\nwhere the palkees were, but they did no harm to Panch-Phul R.anee; for she was\nso fair that not even the cruel beasts of the forest would injure her. At last\nabout four o\'clock in the morning all the wild animals had gone except two\nlittle jackals, who had been very busy watching the rest, and picking the\nbones left by the tigers. Tired with running about, they lay down to rest\nclose to the palkees. Then one little jackal said to the other, who was her\nhusband, \'Do tell me a little story.\'--\' Dear me!\' he exclaimed, \'what people\nyou women are for stories! Well, look just in front of you; do you see those\ntwo?\'--\' Yes,\' she answered; \'what of them?\'--\' That woman you see sitting on\nthe ground,\' he said, \'is the Panch-Phul Ranee.\'--\' And what son of a Rajah is\nthe man in the palkee?\' asked she.--\' That,\' he replied, \'is a very sorrowful\nson.\' His father was so unkind to him that he left his own home, and went to\nlive in another country very far from this; and there he dreamed about the\nPanch-Phul Ranee, and came to our land in order to marry her, but he was\nkilled in jumping the seventh hedge of spears, and so all he gained was to die\nfor her sake.\'\n\n[![](tn/21.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/21.jpg)\n\n\'That is very sad,\' said the first little jackal; \'but could he never by any\nchance come to life again? \'--\' Yes,\' answered the other; \'may be he could, if\nonly some one knew how to apply the proper remedies.\'--.\' What are the proper\nremedies, and how could he be cured? asked the lady jackal. (Now all this\nconversation had been heard by Panch-Phul Ranee, and when this question was\nasked, she listened very eagerly and attentively for the answer.)\n\n\'Do you see this tree?\' replied her husband. \'Well, if some of its leaves were\ncrushed, and a little of the juice put into the Rajah\'s two ears, and upon his\nupper lip, and some upon his temples also, and some upon the spear-wounds in\nhis side, he would come to life again and be as well as ever.\'\n\nAt this moment day dawned, and the two little jackals ran away. Panch-Phul\nRanee did not forget their words. She, a Princess born, who had never put her\nfoot to the ground before (so delicately and tenderly had she been reared),\nwalked over the rough clods of earth and the sharp stones till she reached the\nplace where the tree grew of which the jackals had spoken. She gathered a\nnumber of its leaves; and with hands and feet that had never before done\ncoarse or common work, beat and crushed them down. They were so stiff and\nstrong that it took her a long time. At last, after tearing them, and stamping\non them, and pounding them between two stones, and biting the hardest parts,\nshe thought they were sufficiently crushed: and rolling them up in a corner of\nher saree, she squeezed the juice through it on to her husband\'s temples, and\nput a little on his upper lip, and into his ears, and some also on the spear-\nwounds in his side. And when she had done this, he awoke as if he bad been\nonly sleeping, and sat up, wondering where he was. Before him stood Panch-Phul\nRanee shining like a glorious star, and all around them was the dark jungle.\n\nIt would be hard to say which of them was the most astonished--the Rajah or\nthe Princess. She was surprised that the remedy should have taken such speedy\neffect; and could hardly believe her eyes when she saw her husband get up. And\nif he looked beautiful when dead, much more handsome did he seem to her now--\nso full of life, and animation, and power--the picture of health and strength.\nAnd he in his turn was lost in amazement at the exquisite loveliness of the\nlady who stood before him. He did not know who she could be, for he had never\nseen her like, except in a dream. Could she be really the world-renowned\nPanch-Phul Ranee? or was he dreaming still? He feared to move lest he should\nbreak the spell. But as he sat there wondering, she spoke, saying, \'You marvel\nat what has taken place. You do not know me--I am Panch-Phul Ranee, your\nwife.\'\n\nThen he said, \'Ah, Princess, is it indeed you? You have been very hard to\nme.\'--\' I know, I know,\' she answered; \'I caused your death, but I brought you\nto life again. Let the past be forgotten; come home with me, and my father and\nmother will welcome you as a son.\'\n\nHe replied, \'No, I must first return to my own home awhile. Do you rather\nreturn there now with me, for it is a long time since I left it, and\nafterwards we will come again to your father\'s kingdom.\'\n\nTo this Panch-Phul Ranee agreed. It took them, however, a long time to find\ntheir way out of the jungle. At last they succeeded in doing so, for none of\nthe wild animals in it attempted to injure them--so beautiful and royal did\nthey both look.\n\nWhen they reached the banyan-tree where the Rajah had left the two parrots,\nthe old parrot called out to him, \'So you have come back at last! we thought\nyou never would, you were such a long time away! There you went, leaving us\nhere all that time, and after all doing no good, but only getting yourself\nkilled. Why didn\'t you do as we advised you, and jump up nicely?\'\n\n\'Well, I\'m sure,\' said the Rajah, \'yours is a hard case; but I beg your pardon\nfor keeping you waiting so long, and now I hope you \'II take me and my wife\nhome.\'\n\n\'Yes, we will do that,\' answered the parrots; \'but you had better get some\ndinner first, for its a long journey over the seven seas.\'\n\nSo the Rajah went to the village close by, and bought food for himself and the\nPanch-Phul Ranee. When he returned with it, he said to her, \'I fear the long\njourney before us for you; had you not better let me make it alone, and return\nhere for you when it is over?\' But she answered, \'No! what could I, a poor,\nweak woman, do here alone? and I will not return to my father\'s house till you\ncan come too. Take me with you, however far you go, only promise me you will\nnever leave me.\' So he promised her, and they both, mounting the parrots, were\ncarried up in the air across the seven seas, across the Red Sea, on, on, on, a\nwhole year\'s journey, until they reached his father\'s kingdom, and alighted to\nrest at the foot of the palace garden. The Rajah, however, did not know where\nhe was, for all had much changed since he left in his boyhood.\n\nThen a little son was born to the Rajah and Panch-Phul Ranee. He was a\nbeautiful child, but his father was grieved to think that in that bleak place\nthere was no shelter for the mother or the baby. So he said to his wife, \'I\nwill go to fetch food for us both, and fire to cook it with, and inquire what\nthis country is, and seek out place of rest for you. Do not be afraid; I shall\nsoon return.\' Now far off in the distance smoke was seen to be rising from\ntents which belonged to some conjurors and dancing-people, and thither the\nRajah bent his steps, feeling certain he should be able to get fire, and\nperhaps food also, from the inhabitants. When he got there he found the place\nwas much larger than he had expected, quite a good-sized village, in fact--the\nabode of nautch people and conjurors. In all the houses the people were busy,\nsome dancing, some singing, others trying various conjuring tricks, or\npractising beating the drum, and all seemed happy and joyful.\n\nWhen the conjurors saw him, they were so much struck with his appearance (for\nhe was very handsome) that they determined to make him, if possible, stay\namong them, and join their band. And they said one to another, \'How well he\nwould look beating the drum for the dancers! All the world would come to see\nus dance, if we had such a handsome man as that to beat the drum.\'\n\nThe Rajah, unconscious of their intentions, went into the largest hut he saw,\nand said to a woman who was grinding corn, \'Bai, give me a little rice, and\nsome fire from your hearth.\' She immediately consented, and got up to fetch\nthe burning sticks he asked for; but before she gave them to him, she and her\ncompanions threw upon them a certain powder containing a very potent charm;\nand no sooner did the Rajah receive them, than he forgot about his wife and\nlittle child, his journey, and all that had ever happened to him in his life\nbefore; such was the peculiar property of the powder. And when the conjurors\nsaid to him, \'Why should you go away? stay with us, and be one of us,\' he\nwillingly consented to do so.\n\nAll this time Panch-Phul Ranee waited and waited for her husband, but he never\ncame. Night approached without his having brought her any food, or news of\nhaving found a place of shelter for her and the baby. At last, faint and\nweary, she swooned away.\n\nIt happened that that very day the Ranee (Panch-Phul Ranee\'s husband\'s mother)\nlost her youngest child, a fine little boy of only a day old; and her servants\ntook its body to the bottom of the garden to bury it. Just as they were going\nto do so, they heard a low cry, and, looking round, saw close by a beautiful\nwoman lying on the ground, dead, or apparently so, and beside her a fine\nlittle baby boy. The idea immediately entered their heads, of leaving the dead\nbaby beside the dead woman, and taking her living baby back with them to the\npalace; and so they did.\n\nWhen they returned, they said to their mistress, \'Your child did not die, see\nhere it is, it got well again,\' and showed her Panch-Phul Ranee\'s baby; but\nafter a time, when the Ranee questioned them about it, they told her the whole\ntruth, but she had become meanwhile very fond of the little boy, and so he\ncontinued in the palace, and was brought up as her son; being, in truth, her\ngrandson, though she did not know it.\n\nMeantime the palace Malee\'s wife went out, as her custom was every morning and\nevening, to gather flowers. In search of them she wandered as far as the\njungle at the bottom of the garden, and there she found the Panch-Phul Ranee\nlying as dead, and the dead baby beside her.\n\nThe good woman felt very sorry, and rubbed the Ranee\'s cold hands, and gave\nher sweet flowers to smell, in hopes that she might revive. At last she opened\nher eyes, and seeing the Malee\'s wife, said, \'Where am I? has not my husband\ncome back? and who are you?\'\n\n\'My poor lady,\' answered the Malee\'s wife, \'I do not know where your husband\nis. I am the Malee\'s wife, and, coming here to gather flowers, I found you\nlying on the ground, and this your little baby, which is dead; but come home\nwith me, I will take care of you.\'\n\nPanch-Phul Ranee answered, \'Kind friend, this is not my baby; he did not die;\nhe was the image of his father, and fairer than this child. Some one must have\ntaken him away, for but a little while ago I held him in my arms, and he was\nstrong and well, while this one could never have been more than a puny, weakly\ninfant. Take me away; I will go home with you.\'\n\nSo the Malee\'s wife buried the dead child, and took the Panch Phul Ranee to\nher house, where she lived for fourteen years; but all that time she could\nlearn no tidings of her husband or her lost little boy. The child meanwhile\ngrew up in the palace, and became a very handsome youth. One day he was\nwandering round the garden, and chanced to pass the Malee\'s house. The Panch-\nPhul Ranee was sitting within, watching the Malee\'s wife cook their dinner.\n\nThe young Prince saw her, and calling the Malee\'s wife said to her, \'What\nbeautiful lady is that in your house? and how did she come there?\' She\nanswered, \'Little Prince, what nonsense you talk! there is no lady here.\' He\nsaid again, \'I know there is a beautiful lady here, for I saw her as I passed\nthe open door.\' She replied, \'If you come telling such tales about my house, I\n\'ll pull your tongue out.\' For she thought to herself, \'Unless I scold him\nwell, the boy \'ll go talking about what he has seen in the palace, and then\nperhaps some of the people from there will come and take the poor Panch-Phul\nRanee away from my care.\' But whilst the Malee\'s wife was talking to the young\nPrince, the Panch Phul Ranee came from the inner room to watch and listen to\nhim unobserved, and no sooner did she see him, than she could not forbear\ncrying out, \'Oh, how like he is to my husband! The same eyes; the same shaped\nface, and the same king-like bearing! Can he be my son? He is just the age my\nson would have been had he lived!\'\n\nThe young Prince heard her speaking, and asked what she said, to which the\nMalee\'s wife replied, \'The woman you saw, and who just now spoke, lost her\nchild fourteen years ago, and she was saying to herself how like you were to\nthat child, and thinking you must be the same, but she is wrong, for we know\nyou are the Ranee\'s son.\' Then Panch-Phul Ranee herself came out of the house,\nand said to him, \'Young Prince, I could not, when I saw you, help exclaiming\nhow like you are to what my lost husband was, and to what my son might have\nbeen; for it is now fourteen years since I lost them both.\' And then she told\nhim how she had been a great Princess, and was returning with her husband to\nhis own home (to which they had got half-way in reaching that place), and how\nher little baby had been born in the jungle, and her husband bad gone away to\nseek shelter for her and the child, and fire and food, and had never returned;\nand also how, when she had fainted away, some one had certainly stolen her\nbaby and left a dead child in its place, and how the good Malee\'s wife had\nbefriended her, and taken her ever since to live in her house. And when she\nhad ended her story she began to cry.\n\nBut the Prince said to her, \'Be of good cheer; I will endeavour to recover\nyour husband and child for you: who knows but I may indeed be your son,\nbeautiful lady?\' And running home to the Ranee (his adopted mother), he said\nto her, \'Are you really my mother? Tell me truly; for this I must know before\nthe sun goes down.\' \'Why do you ask foolish questions?\' she replied; \'have I\nnot always treated you as a son?\' \'Yes,\' he said; \'but tell me in very truth,\nam I your own child? or the child of some one else, adopted as yours? If you\ndo not tell me, I will kill myself. And so saying, he drew his sword. She\nreplied, \'Stay, stay, and I will tell you the whole truth: the day before you\nwere born I had a little baby, but it died; and my servants took it to the\nbottom of the garden to bury it, and there they found a beautiful woman lying\nas dead, and beside her was a living infant. You were that child. They brought\nyou to the palace, and I adopted you as my son, and they left my baby in your\nstead.\'--\' What became of my mother?\' he asked. \'I cannot tell,\' answered the\nRanee; \'for, two days afterwards, when I sent to the same place, she and the\nbaby had both disappeared, and I have never since heard of her.\'\n\nThe young Prince, on hearing this, said, \'There is in the head Malee\'s house a\nbeautiful lady whom the Malee\'s wife found in the jungle fourteen years\nago;--that must be my mother. Let her be received here this very day with all\nhonour; for that is the only reparation that can now be made to her.\'\n\nThe Ranee consented, and the young Prince went down to the Malee\'s house\nhimself, to fetch his mother to the palace.\n\nWith him he took a great retinue of people, and a beautiful palanquin for her\nto go in, covered with rich trappings; also costly things for her to wear, and\nmany jewels,--and presents for the good Malee\'s wife.\n\nWhen Panch-Phul Ranee had put on her son\'s gifts, and come out of the Malee\'s\npoor cottage to meet him, all the people said there had never been so royal-\nlooking a queen. As gold and clear crystal are lovely, as mother-of-pearl is\nexquisitely fair and delicate-looking,--so beautiful, so fair, so delicate\nappeared PanchPhul Ranee.\n\nHer son conducted her with much pomp and state to the palace, and did all in\nhis power to honour her; and there she lived long very happily, and beloved by\nall.\n\nOne day the young Prince begged her to tell him again, from the beginning, the\nstory of her life, and as much as she knew of his father\'s life; and so she\ndid. And after that, he said to her, \'Be no longer sad, dear mother, regarding\nmy father\'s fate; for I will send into all lands to gather tidings of him, and\nmaybe in the end we shall find him.\' And he sent people out to hunt for the\'\nRajah all over the kingdom, and in all neighbouring countries;--to the north,\nto the south, to the east, and to the west,--but they found him not.\n\nAt last (after four years of unsuccessful search), when there seemed no hope\nof ever learning what had become of him, PanchPhul Ranee\'s son came to see\nher, and said, \'Mother, I have sent into all lands seeking my father, but can\nhear no news of him. If there were only the slightest clue as to the direction\nin which he went, there would be still some chance of tracing him, but that I\nfear cannot be got. Do you not remember his having said anything of the way\nwhich he intended to go when he left you?\' She answered, \'When your father\nwent away his words to me were, "I will go to fetch food for us both, and fire\nto cook it with, and inquire what this country is, and seek out a place of\nshelter for you. Do not be afraid, I shall soon return." That was all he said,\nand then he went away, and I never saw him more.\'\n\n\'In what direction did he go from the foot of the garden?\' asked the Prince.\n\'He went,\' answered the Panch-Phul Ranee, \'towards that little village of\nconjurors close by. I thought he was intending to ask some of them to give us\nfood. But had he done so, he would certainly have returned in a very short\ntime.\n\n\'Do you think you should know my father, mother darling, if you were to see\nhim again?\' asked the Prince.--\'Yes,\' answered she, \'I should know him\nagain.\'--\' What!\' he said, \'even though eighteen years have gone by since you\nsaw him last? Even though age, and sickness, and want, bad done their utmost\nto change him?\'\n\n\\--\' Yes,\' she replied; \'his every feature is so impressed on my heart, that I\nshould know him again anywhere, or in any disguise.\'\n\n\'Then let us,\' he said, \'send for all those people in the direction of whose\nhouses he went away. May be they have detained him among them to this day. it\nis but a chance, but we can hope for nothing more certain.\'\n\nSo the Panch-Phul Ranee and her son sent down orders to the conjurors\' village\nthat every one of the whole band should come up to the palace that afternoon--\nnot a soul was to stay behind. And the dancers were to dance, and the\nconjurors to play all their tricks, for the amusement of the palace inmates.\n\nThe people came. The nautch-giris began to dance--running, jumping, and flying\nhere, there, and everywhere, some up, some down, some round and round. The\nconjurors conjured; and all began in different ways to amuse the company.\nAmong the rest was one wild, ragged-looking man, whose business was to beat\nthe drum. No sooner did the Panch-Phul Ranee set eyes on him, than she said to\nher son, \'Boy, that is your father!\'--\' What mother,\' he said, \'that wretched-\nlooking man who is beating the drum? \'--\' The same,\' she answered.\n\nThe Prince said to his servants, \'Fetch that man here.\' And the Rajah came\ntowards them: so changed, that not even his own mother knew him;--no one\nrecognised him but his wife! For eighteen years he had been among the nautch\npeople; his hair was rough, his beard untrimmed, his face thin and worn,\nsunburnt and wrinkled; he wore a nose-ring, and heavy ear-rings such as the\nnautch people wear; and his dress was a rough common cumlee. 7 All traces of\nhis former self seemed to have disappeared. They asked him if he did not\nremember he had been a Rajah once; and about his journey to Panch-Phul Ranee\'s\ncountry. But he said, No, he remembered nothing but how to beat the drum--Rub-\na-dub! tat-tat! tom-turn! tom-turn! He thought he must have beaten it all his\nlife.\n\nThen the young Prince gave orders that all the nautch people should be put\ninto jail, until it could be discovered what part they had taken in reducing\nhis father to so pitiable a state. And sending for the wisest doctors in the\nkingdom, he said to them, \'Do your best, and restore the health of this Rajah,\nwho has to all appearance lost both memory and reason; and discover, if\npossible, what has caused these misfortunes to befall him.\' The doctors said,\n\'He has certainly had some potent charm given to him, which has destroyed both\nhis memory and reason, but we will do our best to counteract its influence.\'\n\nAnd so they did. And their treatment succeeded so well, that, after a time,\nthe Rajah entirely recovered his former senses. And they took such good care\nof him, that within a while he regained his health and strength also, and\nlooked almost as well as ever.\n\nHe then found to his surprise that he, Panch-Phul Ranee, and their son, had\nall this time been living in his father\'s kingdom. His father was so delighted\nto see him again, that he was no longer unkind to him, but treated him as a\ndearly-beloved, long-lost son. His mother also was overjoyed at his return,\nand they said to him, \'Since you have been restored to us again, why should\nyou wander any more? Your wife and son are here; do you also remain here, and\nlive among us for the rest of your days.\' But he replied, \'I have another wife\n--the Carpenter\'s daughter who first was kind to me in my adopted country. I\nalso have there nine hundred and ninety-eight talking wooden parrots, which I\ngreatly prize. Let me first go and fetch them.\'\n\nThey said, \'Very well; go quickly, and return.\' So he mounted the two wooden\nparrots which had brought him from the PanchPhul Ranee\'s country (and which\nhad for eighteen years lived in the jungle close to the palace), and returned\nto the land where his first wife lived, and fetched her and the nine hundred\nand ninety-eight remaining wooden parrots to his father\'s kingdom. Then his\nfather said to him, \'Don\'t have any quarrelling with your half-brother after I\nam dead\' (for his half-brother was son of the old Rajah\'s favourite wife). \'I\nlove you both dearly, and will give each of you half of my kingdom.\' So he\ndivided the kingdom into two halves, and gave the one half to the Panch-Phul\nRanee\'s husband, who was the son of his first wife, and the other half to the\neldest son of his second but favourite wife.\n\nA short time after this arrangement was made, Panch-Phul Ranee said to her\nhusband, \'I wish to see my father and mother again before I die; let me go and\nsee them.\' He answered, \'You shall go, and I and our son will also go.\' So he\ncalled four of the wooden parrots--two to carry himself and the Ranee, and two\nto carry their son. Each pair of parrots crossed their wings; the young Prince\nsat upon the two wings of one pair, and on the wings of the other pair sat his\nfather and mother. Then they all rose up in the air, and the parrots carried\nthem (as they had before carried the Rajah alone)--up, up, up--on, on, on--\nover the Red Sea and across the seven seas, until they reached the Panch Phul\nRanee\'s country.\n\nPanch-Phul Ranee\'s father saw them come flying through the air, as quickly as\nshooting stars; and much wondering who they were, he sent out many of his\nnobles and chief officers to inquire.\n\nThe nobles went out to meet them, and called out, \'What great Rajah is this\nwho is dressed so royally, and comes flying through the air so fast? Tell us,\nthat we may tell our Rajah.\'\n\nThe Rajah answered, \'Go and tell your master that this is Panch-Phul Ranee\'s\nhusband come to visit his father-in-law.\' So they took that answer back to the\npalace; but when the Rajah heard it, he said, \'I cannot tell what this means--\nfor the PanchPhul Ranee\'s husband died long ago. It is twenty years since he\nfell upon the iron spears and died; let us, however, go and discover who this\ngreat Rajah really is.\' And he and all his court went out to meet the new-\ncorners--just as the parrots had alighted close to the palace gate. The Panch-\nPhul Ranee took her son by the one hand and her husband by the other, and\nwalking to meet her father, said, \'Father, I have come to see you again. This\nis my husband who died, and this boy is my son.\' Then all the land was glad to\nsee the Panch-Phul Ranee back, and the people said, \'Our Princess is the most\nbeautiful Princess in the world, and her husband is as handsome as she is, and\nher son is a fair boy; we will that they should always live among us and reign\nover us.\'\n\nWhen they bad rested a little, the Panch-Phul Ranee told her father and mother\nthe story of all her adventures from the time she and her husband were left in\nthe palkees in the jungle. And when they had heard it, her father said to the\nRajah her husband, \'You must never go away again; for see, I have no son but\nyou. You and your son must reign here after me. And behold, all this great\nkingdom will I now give you, if you will only stay with us; for I am old and\nweary of governing the land.\'\n\nBut the Rajah answered, \'I must return once again to my own country, and then\nI will stay with you as long as I live.\'\n\nSo leaving the Panch-Phul Ranee and her son with the old Rajah and Ranee, be\nmounted his parrots and once more returned to his father\'s land. And when he\nhad reached it, he said to his mother, \'Mother, my father-in-law has given me\na kingdom ten thousand times larger than this. So I have but returned to bid\nyou farewell, and fetch my first wife, and then I must go back to live in that\nother land.\' She answered, \'Very well; so you are happy anywhere, I am happy\ntoo.\'\n\nHe then said to his half-brother, \'Brother, my father-in-law has given me all\nthe Panch-Phul Ranee\'s country, which is very far away; therefore I give up to\nyou the half of this kingdom that my father gave to me.\' Then bidding his\nfather farewell, he took the Carpenter\'s daughter back with him (riding\nthrough the air on two of the wooden parrots and followed by the rest) to the\nPanch-Phul Ranee\'s country, and there he, and his two wives, and his son,\nlived very happily all their mortal days.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd13.htm#fr_50) \xc2\xa315.\n\n[2](odd13.htm#fr_51) Four or six shillings.\n\n[3](odd13.htm#fr_52) The god Mahadeo is an incarnation of Siva the Destroyer.\nThe goddess Parbuttee is his wife.\n\n[4](odd13.htm#fr_53) House.\n\n[5](odd13.htm#fr_54) O my child!\n\n[6](odd13.htm#fr_55) Child.\n\n[7](odd13.htm#fr_56) A coarse woollen blanket.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X.
