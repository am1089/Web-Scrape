The absence of that (i.e. of dreams, i.e. dreamless sleep) takes place in\nthe na _d_ is and in the Self; according to scriptural statement.\n\nThe state of dream has been discussed; we are now going to enquire into the\nstate of deep sleep. A number of scriptural passages refer to that state. In\none place we read, 'When a man is asleep, reposing and at perfect rest so that\nhe sees no dream, then he has entered into those na _d_ is' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII,\n6, 3). In another place it is said with reference to the na _d_ is, 'Through\nthem he moves forth and rests in the surrounding body' (B _ri_. Up. II, 1,\n19). So also in another place, 'In these the person is when sleeping he sees\nno dream. Then he becomes one with the pra _n_ a alone' (Kau. Up. IV, 20).\nAgain in another place, 'That ether which is within the heart in that he\nreposes' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22). Again, 'Then he becomes united with that\nwhich is; he is gone to his Self ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, i). And, 'Embraced by the\nhighest Self (pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) he knows nothing that is without, nothing that is\nwithin' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 21). Here the doubt arises whether the na _d_ is,\n&c., mentioned in the above passages are independent from each other and\nconstitute various places for the soul in the state of deep sleep, or if they\nstand in mutual relation so as to constitute one such place only. The\npurvapakshin takes the former view on account of the various places mentioned\nserving one and the same purpose. Things serving the same purpose, as, e.g.\nrice and barley 1, are never seen to be dependent\n\np. 142\n\non each other. That the na _d_ is, &c., actually serve the same purpose\nappears from the circumstance of their being all of them exhibited equally in\nthe locative case, 'he has entered into the na _d_ is,' 'he rests in the\npericardium,' &c. 1\\--But in some of the passages quoted the locative case is\nnot employed, so, e.g. in 'He becomes united with that which is' (sata,\ninstrumental case)!--That makes no difference, we reply, because there also\nthe locative case is meant. For in the complementary passage the text states\nthat the soul desirous of rest enters into the Self, 'Finding no rest\nelsewhere it settles down on breath' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 2); a passage in which\nthe word 'breath' refers to that which is (the sat). A place of rest of course\nimplies the idea of the locative case. The latter case is, moreover, actually\nexhibited in a further complementary passage, 'When they have become merged in\nthat which is (sati), they know not that they are merged in it.'--In all these\npassages one and the same state is referred to, viz. the state of deep sleep\nwhich is characterised by the suspension of all special cognition. Hence we\nconclude that in the state of deep sleep the soul optionally goes to any one\nof those places, either the na _d_ is, or that which is, &c.\n\nTo this we make the following reply--'The absence of that,' i.e. the absence\nof dreams--which absence constitutes the essence of deep sleep-takes place 'in\nthe na _d_ is and in the Self;' i.e. in deep sleep the soul goes into both\ntogether, not optionally into either.--How is this known?--'From scripture.'--\nScripture says of all those things, the na _d_ is, &c., that they are the\nplace of deep sleep; and those statements we must combine into one, as the\nhypothesis of option would involve partial refutation 2. The assertion\n\np. 143\n\nmade above that we are compelled to allow option because the na _d_ is, &c.,\nserve one and the same purpose, is without foundation; for from the mere fact\nof two things being exhibited in the same case it does not follow by any means\nthat they serve the same purpose, and that for that reason we have to choose\nbetween them. We on the contrary see that one and the same case is employed\neven where things serve different purposes and have to be combined; we say,\ne.g. 'he sleeps in the palace, he sleeps on the couch 1.' So in the present\ncase also the different statements can be combined into one, 'He sleeps in the\nna _d_ is, in the surrounding body, in Brahman.' Moreover, the scriptural\npassage, 'In these the person is when sleeping he sees no dream; then he\nbecomes one with the pra _n_ a alone,' declares, by mentioning them together\nin one sentence, that the na _d_ is and the pra _n_ a are to be combined in\nthe state of deep sleep. That by pra _n_ a Brahman is meant we have already\nshown (I, 1, 28). Although in another text the na _d_ is are spoken of as an\nindependent place of deep sleep as it were ('then he has entered into those na\n_d_ is'), yet, in order not to contradict other passages in which Brahman is\nspoken of as the place of deep sleep, we must explain that text to mean that\nthe soul abides in Brahman through the na _d_ is. Nor is this interpretation\nopposed to the employment of the locative case ('into--or in--those na _d_\nis'); for if the soul enters into Brahman by means of the na _d_ is it is at\nthe same time in the na _d_ is; just as a man who descends to the sea by means\nof the river Ga\xe1\xb9\x85ga is at the same time on the Ga\xe1\xb9\x85ga.--Moreover that passage\nabout the na _d_ is, because its purpose is to describe the road, consisting\nof the rays and na _d_ is, to the Brahma world, mentions the entering of the\nsoul into the na _d_ is in order to glorify the latter (not in order to\ndescribe the state of deep sleep); for the clause following upon the one which\nrefers to the entering\n\np. 144\n\npraises the na _d_ is, 'There no evil touches him.' The text, moreover, adds a\nreason for the absence of all evil, in the words, 'For then he has become\nunited with the light.' That means that on account of the light contained in\nthe na _d_ is (which is called bile) having overpowered the organs the person\nno longer sees the sense-objects. Or else Brahman may be meant by the 'light;'\nwhich term is applied to Brahman in another passage also, 'It is Brahman only,\nlight only' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 7). The passage would then mean that the soul\nbecomes, by means of the na _d_ is, united with Brahman, and that hence no\nevil touches it. That the union with Brahman is the reason for the absence of\nall contact with evil, is known from other scriptural passages, such as, 'All\nevils turn back from it; for the world of Brahman is free from all evil' (\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 4, 1). On that account we have to combine the na _d_ is with\nBrahman, which from other passages is known to be the place of deep sleep.--\nAnalogously we conclude that the pericardium also, because it is mentioned in\na passage treating of Brahman, is a place of deep sleep only in subordination\nto Brahman. For the ether within the heart is at first spoken of as the place\nof sleep ('He lies in the ether which is in the heart,' B _ri_. Up. II, 1,\n17), and with reference thereto it is said later on, 'He rests in the\npericardium' (II, 1, 19). Pericardium (puritat) is a name of that which\nenvelops the heart; hence that which rests within the ether of the heart--\nwhich is contained in the pericardium--can itself be said to rest within the\npericardium; just as a man living in a town surrounded by walls is said to\nlive within the walls. That the ether within the heart is Brahman has already\nbeen shown (I, 3, l4).--That again the na _d_ is and the pericardium have to\nbe combined as places of deep sleep appears from their being mentioned\ntogether in one sentence ('Through them he moves forth and rests in the\npuritat). That that which is (sat) and the intelligent Self (pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a)\nare only names of Brahman is well known; hence scripture mentions only three\nplaces of deep sleep, viz. the na _d_ is, the pericardium, and Brahman. Among\nthese three again Brahman alone is the lasting place of deep sleep; the\n\np. 145\n\nna _d_ is and the pericardium are mere roads leading to it. Moreover (to\nexplain further the difference of the manner in which the soul, in deep sleep,\nenters into the na _d_ is, the pericardium and Brahman respectively), the na\n_d_ is and the pericardium are (in deep sleep) merely the abode of the\nlimiting adjuncts of the soul; in them the soul's organs abide 1. For apart\nfrom its connexion with the limiting adjuncts it is impossible for the soul in\nitself to abide anywhere, because being non-different from Brahman it rests in\nits own glory. And if we say that, in deep sleep, it abides in Brahman we do\nnot mean thereby that there is a difference between the abode and that which\nabides, but that there is absolute identity of the two. For the text says,\n'With that which is he becomes united, he is gone to his Self;' which means\nthat the sleeping person has entered into his true nature.--It cannot,\nmoreover, be said that the soul is at any time not united with Brahman--for\nits true nature can never pass away--; but considering that in the state of\nwaking and that of dreaming it passes, owing to the contact with its limiting\nadjuncts, into something else, as it were, it may be said that when those\nadjuncts cease in deep sleep it passes back into its true nature. Hence it\nwould be entirely wrong to assume that, in deep sleep, it sometimes becomes\nunited with Brahman and sometimes not 2. Moreover, even if we admit that there\nare different places for the soul in deep sleep, still there does not result,\nfrom that difference of place, any difference in the quality of deep sleep\nwhich is in all cases characterised by the cessation of special cognition; it\nis, therefore, more appropriate to say that the soul does (in deep sleep) not\ncognize on account of its oneness, having become united with Brahman;\naccording to the _S_ ruti, 'How should he know another?' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5,\nl5).--If, further, the sleeping soul did rest in the na _d_ is and the\npuritat, it would be impossible\n\np. 146\n\nto assign any reason for its not cognizing, because in that case it would\ncontinue to have diversity for its object; according to the _S_ ruti, 'When\nthere is, as it were, duality, then one sees the other,' &c.--But in the case\nof him also who has diversity for his object, great distance and the like may\nbe reasons for absence of cognition!--What you say might indeed apply to our\ncase if the soul were acknowledged to be limited in itself; then its case\nwould be analogous to that of Vish _n_ umitra, who, when staying in a foreign\nland, cannot see his home. But, apart from its adjuncts, the soul knows no\nlimitation.--Well, then, great distance, &c., residing in the adjuncts may be\nthe reason of non-cognition!--Yes, but that leads us to the conclusion already\narrived at, viz. that the soul does not cognize when, the limiting adjuncts\nhaving ceased, it has become one with Brahman.\n\nNor do we finally maintain that the na _d_ is, the pericardium, and Brahman\nare to be added to each other as being equally places of deep sleep. For by\nthe knowledge that the na _d_ is and the pericardium are places of sleep,\nnothing is gained, as scripture teaches neither that some special fruit is\nconnected with that knowledge nor that it is the subordinate member of some\nwork, &c., connected with certain results. We, on the other hand, do want to\nprove that that Brahman is the lasting abode of the soul in the state of deep\nsleep; that is a knowledge which has its own uses, viz. the ascertainment of\nBrahman being the Self of the soul, and the ascertainment of the soul being\nessentially non-connected with the worlds that appear in the waking and in the\ndreaming state. Hence the Self alone is the place of deep sleep.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[141:1](sbe38110.htm#fr_104) Either of which may be employed for making the\nsacrificial cake.\n\n[142:1](sbe38110.htm#fr_105) The argument of the purvapakshin is that the\ndifferent places in which the soul is said to abide in the state of deep sleep\nare all exhibited by the text in the same case and are on that account co-\nordinate.
