The bhuman (is Brahman), as the instruction about it is additional to that\nabout the state of deep sleep (i.e. the vital air which remains awake even in\nthe state of deep sleep).\n\nWe read ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 23; 24), 'That which is much (bhuman) we must desire\nto understand.--Sir, I desire to understand it.--Where one sees nothing else,\nhears nothing else, understands nothing else, that is what is much (bhuman).\nWhere one sees something else, hears something else, understands something\nelse, that is the Little.'--Here the doubt arises whether that which is much\nis the vital air (pra _n_ a) or the highest Self.--Whence the doubt?--The word\n'bhuman,' taken by itself, means the state of being much, according to its\nderivation as taught by Pa _n_ ini, VI, 4, 158. Hence there is felt the want\nof a specification showing what constitutes the Self of that muchness. Here\nthere presents itself at first the approximate passage, 'The vital air is more\nthan hope' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 15, 1), from which we may conclude that the vital\nair is bhuman.--On the other hand, we meet at the beginning of the chapter,\nwhere the general topic is stated, with the following passage, 'I have heard\nfrom men like you that he who knows the Self overcomes grief. I am in grief.\nDo, Sir, help me over this grief of mine;' from which passage it would appear\nthat the bhuman is the highest Self.--Hence there arises a doubt as to which\nof the two alternatives is to be embraced, and which is to be set aside.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the bhuman is the vital air, since there is\nfound no further series of questions and answers as to what is more. For while\nwe meet with a series of questions and answers (such as, 'Sir, is there\nsomething which is more than a name?'--'Speech is more than name.'--'Is there\nsomething which is more than speech?'--' Mind is more than speech'), which\nextends from name up to vital air, we do not meet with a similar question and\nanswer as to what might be more than vital air (such as, 'Is there something\n\np. 163\n\nwhich is more than vital air?'--'Such and such a thing is more than vital\nair'). The text rather at first declares at length (in the passage, 'The vital\nair is more than hope,' &c.) that the vital air is more than all the members\nof the series from name up to hope; it then acknowledges him who knows the\nvital air to be an ativadin, i.e. one who makes a statement surpassing the\npreceding statements (in the passage, 'Thou art an ativadin. He may say I am\nan ativadin; he need not deny it'); and it thereupon (in the passage, 'But he\nin reality is an ativadin who declares something beyond by means of the True'\n1),--not leaving off, but rather continuing to refer to the quality of an\nativadin which is founded on the vital air,--proceeds, by means of the series\nbeginning with the True, to lead over to the bhuman; so that we conclude the\nmeaning to be that the vital air is the bhuman.--But, if the bhuman is\ninterpreted to mean the vital air, how have we to explain the passage in which\nthe bhuman is characterised. 'Where one sees nothing else?' &c.--As, the\npurvapakshin replies, in the state of deep sleep we observe a cessation of all\nactivity, such as seeing, &c., on the part of the organs merged in the vital\nair, the vital air itself may be characterised by a passage such as, 'Where\none sees nothing else.' Similarly, another scriptural passage (Pra. Up. IV, 2;\n3) describes at first (in the words, 'He does not hear, he does not see,' &c.)\nthe state of deep sleep as characterised by the cessation of the activity of\nall bodily organs, and then by declaring that in that state the vital air,\nwith its five modifications, remains awake ('The fires of the pra _n_ as are\nawake in that town'), shows the vital air to occupy the principal position in\nthe state of deep sleep.--That passage also, which speaks of the bliss of the\nbhuman ('The bhuman is bliss,' _Kh_. Up. VII, 23), can be reconciled with our\nexplanation, because Pra. Up. IV, 6 declares bliss to attach to the state of\ndeep sleep ('Then that god sees no dreams and at that time that happiness\narises in his body').--Again, the statement, 'The bhuman is immortality' (\n_Kh_. Up. VII, 24, 1), may\n\np. 164\n\nlikewise refer to the vital air; for another scriptural passage says, 'Pra _n_\na is immortality' (Kau. Up. III, 2).--But how can the view according to which\nthe bhuman is the vital air be reconciled with the fact that in the beginning\nof the chapter the knowledge of the Self is represented as the general topic\n('He who knows the Self overcomes grief,' &c.)?--By the Self there referred\nto, the purvapakshin replies, nothing else is meant but the vital air. For the\npassage, 'The vital air is father, the vital air is mother, the vital air is\nbrother, the vital air is sister, the vital air is teacher, the vital air is\nBrahma _n_ a' ( _Kh._ Up. VII, 15, 1), represents the vital air as the Self of\neverything. As, moreover, the passage, 'As the spokes of a wheel rest in the\nnave, so all this rests in pra _n_ a,' declares the pra _n_ a to be the Self\nof all--by means of a comparison with the spokes and the nave of a wheel--the\npra _n_ a may be conceived under the form of bhuman, i.e. plenitude.--Bhuman,\ntherefore, means the vital air.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--Bhuman can mean the highest Self only,\nnot the vital air.--Why?--'On account of information being given about it,\nsubsequent to bliss.' The word 'bliss' (samprasada) means the state of deep\nsleep, as may be concluded, firstly, from the etymology of the word ('In it\nhe, i.e. man, is altogether pleased--samprasidati')--and, secondly, from the\nfact of samprasada being mentioned in the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka together with\nthe state of dream and the waking state. And as in the state of deep sleep the\nvital air remains awake, the word 'samprasada' is employed in the Sutra to\ndenote the vital air; so that the Sutra means, 'on account of information\nbeing given about the bhuman, subsequently to (the information given about)\nthe vital air.' If the bhuman were the vital air itself, it would be a strange\nproceeding to make statements about the bhuman in addition to the statements\nabout the vital air. For in the preceding passages also we do not meet, for\ninstance, with a statement about name subsequent to the previous statement\nabout name (i.e. the text does not say 'name is more than name'), but after\nsomething has been said about name, a new statement is\n\np. 165\n\nmade about speech, which is something different from name (i. e. the text\nsays, 'Speech is more than name'), and so on up to the statement about vital\nair, each subsequent statement referring to something other than the topic of\nthe preceding one. We therefore conclude that the bhuman also, the statement\nabout which follows on the statement about the vital air, is something other\nthan the vital air. But--it may be objected--we meet here neither with a\nquestion, such as, 'Is there something more than vital air?' nor with an\nanswer, such as, 'That and that is more than vital air.' How, then, can it be\nsaid that the information about the bhuman is given subsequently to the\ninformation about the vital air?--Moreover, we see that the circumstance of\nbeing an ativadin, which is exclusively connected with the vital air, is\nreferred to in the subsequent passage (viz. 'But in reality he is an ativadin\nwho makes a statement surpassing (the preceding statements) by means of the\nTrue'). There is thus no information additional to the information about the\nvital air.--To this objection we reply that it is impossible to maintain that\nthe passage last quoted merely continues the discussion of the quality of\nbeing an ativadin, as connected with the knowledge of the vital air; since the\nclause, 'He who makes a statement surpassing, &c. by means of the True,'\nstates a specification.--But, the objector resumes, this very statement of a\nspecification may be explained as referring to the vital air. If you ask how,\nwe refer you to an analogous case. If somebody says, 'This Agnihotrin speaks\nthe truth,' the meaning is not that the quality of being an Agnihotrin depends\non speaking the truth; that quality rather depends on the (regular performance\nof the) agnihotra only, and speaking the truth is mentioned merely as a\nspecial attribute of that special Agnihotrin. So our passage also ('But in\nreality he is an ativadin who makes a statement, &c. by means of the True')\ndoes not intimate that the quality of being an ativadin depends on speaking\nthe truth, but merely expresses that speaking the truth is a special attribute\nof him who knows the vital air; while the quality of being an ativadin must be\nconsidered to depend on the knowledge of the vital air.--This\n\np. 166\n\nobjection we rebut by the remark that it involves an abandonment of the direct\nmeaning of the sacred text. For from the text, as it stands, we understand\nthat the quality of being an ativadin depends on speaking the truth; the sense\nbeing: An ativadin is he who is an ativadin by means of the True. The passage\ndoes not in anyway contain a eulogisation of the knowledge of the vital air.\nIt could be connected with the latter only on the ground of general subject-\nmatter (prakara _n_ a)  1; which would involve an abandonment of the direct\nmeaning of the text in favour of prakara _n_ a  2.--Moreover, the particle but\n('But in reality he is,' &c.), whose purport is to separate (what follows)\nfrom the subject-matter of what precedes, would not agree (with the pra _n_ a\nexplanation). The following passage also, 'But we must desire to know the\nTrue' (VII, 16), which presupposes a new effort, shows that a new topic is\ngoing to be entered upon.--For these reasons we have to consider the statement\nabout the ativadin in the same light as we should consider the remark--made in\na conversation which previously had turned on the praise of those who study\none Veda--that he who studies the four Vedas is a great Brahma _n_ a; a remark\nwhich we should understand to be laudatory of persons different from those who\nstudy one Veda, i.e. of those who study all the four Vedas. Nor is there any\nreason to assume that a new topic can be introduced in the form of question\nand answer only; for that the matter propounded forms a new topic is\nsufficiently clear from the circumstance that no connexion can be established\nbetween it and the preceding topic. The succession of topics in the chapter\nunder discussion is as follows: Narada at first listens to the instruction\nwhich Sanatkumara gives him about various matters, the last of which is Pra\n_n_ a, and then becomes silent. Thereupon Sanatkumara explains to him\nspontaneously (without being\n\np. 167\n\nasked) that the quality of being an ativadin, if merely based on the knowledge\nof the vital air--which knowledge has for its object an unreal product,--is\ndevoid of substance, and that he only is an ativadin who is such by means of\nthe True. By the term 'the True' there is meant the highest Brahman; for\nBrahman is the Real, and it is called the 'True' in another scriptural passage\nalso, viz. Taitt. Up. II, 1, 'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman.'\nNarada, thus enlightened, starts a new line of enquiry ('Might I, Sir, become\nan ativadin by the True?') and Sanatkumara then leads him, by a series of\ninstrumental steps, beginning with understanding, up to the knowledge of\nbhuman. We therefrom conclude that the bhuman is that very True whose\nexplanation had been promised in addition to the (knowledge of the) vital air.\nWe thus see that the instruction about the bhuman is additional to the\ninstruction about the vital air, and bhuman must therefore mean the highest\nSelf, which is different from the vital air. With this interpretation the\ninitial statement, according to which the enquiry into the Self forms the\ngeneral subject-matter, agrees perfectly well. The assumption, on the other\nhand (made by the purvapakshin), that by the Self we have here to understand\nthe vital air is indefensible. For, in the first place, Self-hood does not\nbelong to the vital air in any non-figurative sense. In the second place,\ncessation of grief cannot take place apart from the knowledge of the highest\nSelf; for, as another scriptural passage declares, 'There is no other path to\ngo' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 15). Moreover, after we have read at the outset, 'Do,\nSir, lead me over to the other side of grief' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 1, 3), we meet\nwith the following concluding words (VII, 26, 2), 'To him, after his faults\nhad been rubbed out, the venerable Sanatkumara showed the other side of\ndarkness.' The term 'darkness' here denotes Nescience, the cause of grief, and\nso on.--Moreover, if the instruction terminated with the vital air, it would\nnot be said of the latter that it rests on something else. But the brahma _n_\na ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 36, 1) does say, 'The vital air springs from the Self.' Nor\ncan it be objected against this last argument that the concluding\n\np. 168\n\npart of the chapter may refer to the highest Self, while, all the same, the\nbhuman (mentioned in an earlier part of the chapter) may be the vital air.\nFor, from the passage (VII, 24, 1), ('Sir, in what does the bhuman rest? In\nits own greatness,' &c.), it appears that the bhuman forms the continuous\ntopic up to the end of the chapter.--The quality of being the bhuman--which\nquality is plenitude--agrees, moreover, best with the highest Self, which is\nthe cause of everything.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[163:1](sbe34077.htm#fr_175) As might be the prima facie conclusion from the\nparticle 'but' introducing the sentence 'but he in reality,' &c.\n\n[166:1](sbe34077.htm#fr_176) It being maintained that the passage referred to\nis to be viewed in connexion with the general subject-matter of the preceding\npast of the chapter.\n\n[166:2](sbe34077.htm#fr_177) And would thus involve a violation of a\nfundamental principle of the Mima _m_ sa.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 9](sbe34078.htm)\n\n"
