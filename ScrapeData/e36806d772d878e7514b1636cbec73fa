Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1899], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. xvii\n\n### PREFACE.\n\nTHE YAJURVEDA\xc2\x97derived from the roots _yaj_ , to sacrifice or, worship, and\n_vid_ , to know,\xc2\x97is the Knowledge of Sacrifice or Sacrificial Texts and\nFormulas as distinguished from the Rigveda or Knowledge of Recited Praise, the\nSamaveda or Knowledge of Chanted Hymns, and the Atharva or Brahmaveda which is\nthe Knowledge of Prayer, Charm, and Spells. Though ranking second in the\nIndian enumeration of the Vedas and containing much that is of very ancient\norigin, its compilation in its present form, exhibiting as it does the almost\ncomplete development of castes and mixt castes and considerable advance in\narts and sciences, trades, handicrafts and occupations, is evidently of later\ndate than that even of the Atharva. The Samhita or Collection of its hymns,\ntexts, and formulas, constituting the hymn-book and prayer-book of the\nAdhvaryu priests as distinguished from the Hotar, the Udgatar, and the\nBrahman, the special priests, respectively, of the three other Vedas, owes its\norigin to the increasing multiformity and complication of the Indian ritual\nand the recognized insufficiency of the simple and unsystematically arranged\nCollection of Rigveda Hymns to meet the requirements of the performers of\nvarious essentially important rites and ceremonies.\n\nThe Yajurveda, owing to a schism among its earliest teachers and their\nfollowers, was divided into two distinct Samhitas or Collections\ncalled\xc2\x97probably from the names of the Rishis or inspired Seers who, ate\nrespectively their reputed compilers\xc2\x97the Taittiriya and the Vajasaneya or\nVajasaneyi; the former and older being known also by the title Krishna or\nBlack\xc2\x97probably from its dark or obscure appearance, the collection of\nsacrificial texts and formulas being perplexingly\n\np. xviii\n\nintermingled with the Brahmana or exegetical portion which explains them and\nteaches their ritual application\xc2\x97, and the latter being called Sukla or White,\nthe revised, systematic and clear collection, containing the texts and\nformulas by themselves with a totally distinct Brahmana, the Satapatha, as an\nappendix. In the two divisions, besides these essential points of difference,\nare found occasional verbal and orthoepic variations which are generally of\nlittle importance. The order of rites and ceremonies is substantially\nidentical, but the White contains a few more texts than the Black.\n\nThe Samhita of the White Yajurveda consists of forty Adhyayas or Books\ncontaining, with frequent repetitions of the same text, about two thousand\nverses. A large portion of these are Richas or Strophes borrowed\xc2\x97frequently\nwith variations\xc2\x97from the Rigveda, and sometimes from the Atharva these, of\ncourse, are metrical. Nearly equal in quantity are the Yajus texts or\nsacrificial formulas\xc2\x97the most characteristic portion, from which the Veda\nderives its name\xc2\x97composed in measured prose 'which rises now and then,' as\nProfessor Weber observes, 'to a true rhythmical swing,' and long passages,\nsuch as the lists of victims to be tied up and dedicated at the Asvamedha and\nthe Purushamedha, which are necessarily in the simplest prose.\n\nFor further information with regard to this Veda the reader should consult\nProfessor Weber's History of Indian Literature (English Translation by John\nMann and Theodor Zachariae: Trubner's Oriental Series); Professor Max Muller's\nHistory of Ancient Sanskrit Literature; Professor J. Eggeling's Introduction,\nVol. XII. of the Sacred Books of the East, or, for a briefer account, Mrs.\nManning's Ancient and Mediaeval India, Vol. I. pp. 107-109.\n\nMy translation follows the fine edition of the White Yajurveda or Vajasaneyi-\nSanhita, in the two recensions\xc2\x97the Madhyandina\n\np. xix\n\nand the Kanva\xc2\x97, with Mahidhara's Commentary, the Vedadipa, or Lamp of\nKnowledge, written towards the close of the sixteenth century, published under\nthe patronage of the Honourable Court of Directors of the East India Company\nin 1849 at Berlin by Dr. Albrecht Weber, at that time Docent of the Sanskrit\nlanguage at that University. This excellent edition consisting of three Parts\nthe latter two of which contain the Satapatha-Brahmana in the Madhyandina\nrecension with extracts from the Commentaries of Sayana, Harisvamin, and\nDvivedaganga, and the Srautra-Sutra of Katyayana with extracts from the\nCommentaries of Karka and Yaj\xc3\xb1ikadeva, has not been reprinted and is now\npractically unobtainable. In India the text of the Madhyandina recension with\nMahidhara's Commentary has been issued in a cheap form at Calcutta by Pandit\nJibananda Vidyasagara, B. A., Superintendent of the Free Sanskrit College, of\nwhich a second edition appeared in 1892; and a lithographed edition of the\ntext with a Hindi translation of Mahidhara's Commentary was published in 1874,\nat Besma in the North-Western Provinces, by Raja Giriprasadavarman of that\nplace. A cheap edition of the text, in unbound MS. form, has been published at\nBombay.\n\nNo separate translation of the whole Samhita or Collection of Texts and\nFormulas has appeared in any European language. It was Professor Weber's\nintention, as signified in his History of Indian Literature, to bring out a\ntranslation giving the ceremonial belonging to each verse, together with a\nfull glossary, but 'this promise has not been fulfilled, owing to the pressure\nof other labours.' This scholar had previously published a Latin translation,\nwith annotations in the same language, of Books IX. and X. in his Vajasaneya-\nSanhitae Specimen (Breslau, 1846), and more recently a German version of Book\nXVI. in Indische Studien II. pp. 14 ff., and of the list of men and women to\nbe dedicated at the Purushamedha in his treatise on Human Sacrifice among\nIndians of the Vedic Age reprinted\n\np. xx\n\nin his Indische Streifen I. pp. 76-84. Of Book XL. as an Upanishad there are\nseveral translations into English.\n\nMoreover, nearly the whole of the first eighteen Books has been\nincorporated\xc2\x97dissected and explained clause by clause\xc2\x97in the first nine Books\nof the Satapatha-Brahmana; and an admirable translation of this vast work by\nProfessor Julius Eggeling is now nearly completed in the Sacred Books of the\nEast, four volumes (XII, XXVI., XLI., XLIII. of that series) having already\nappeared, and the concluding volume (XLV) being in the press. From this\ntranslation\xc2\x97which, but for its bulk and costliness would make half of my work\nsuperfluous\xc2\x97and from Professor Eggeling's annotations, I have derived the\ngreatest assistance, and most gratefully record my obligations.\n\nAll that I have attempted to do is to give a faithful translation, to the best\nof my ability, of the texts and sacrificial formulas of the Veda, with just\nsufficient commentary, chiefly from Mahidhara, to make them intelligible. Much\nadditional information way be found in Professor A. Hillebrandt's Ritual-\nLitteratur, Vedische Opfer and Zauber (Grundriss der Indo-Arischen Philologie\nand Altertumskunde), Strassburg: 1897; and further minute details of the\nvarious sacrifices, rites and ceremonies are given in the Satapatha-Brahmana\nas already mentioned, and in various articles, referred to in my notes, by\nProfessor A. Weber, the great authority on the Yajurveda and all that is\nconnected with it.\n\nR. T. H. GRIFFITH.\n\nKOTAGIRI, NILGIRIS  \nMay, 1899.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book I](wyvbk01.htm)\n\n"
