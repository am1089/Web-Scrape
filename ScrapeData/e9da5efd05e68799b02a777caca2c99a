The sage austere,  \nTrue to his vows, from evil clear,  \nCalled forth the names of those great charms  \nWhose powers restrain the deadly arms,  \nReceive thou True and Truly famed,  \nAnd Bold and Fleet: the weapons named  \n\np. 43  \n\nWarder and Progress, swift of pace,  \nAverted-head and Drooping-face;  \nThe Seen, and that which Secret flies;  \nThe weapon of the thousand eyes;  \nTen-headed, and the Hundred-faced,  \nStar-gazer and the Layer-waste:  \nThe Omen-bird, the Pure-from-spot,  \nThe pair that wake and slumber not:  \nThe Fiendish, that which shakes amain,  \nThe Strong-of-Hand, the Rich-in-Gain:  \nThe Guardian, and the Close-allied,  \nThe Gaper, Love, and Golden-side;  \nO Raghu's son receive all these,  \nBright ones that wear what forms they please;  \nKris'asva's mystic sons are they,  \nAnd worthy thou their might to sway.'  \nWith joy the pride of Raghu's race  \nReceived the hermit's proffered grace,  \nMysterious arms, to check and stay,  \nOr smite the foeman in the fray.  \nThen, all with heavenly forms endued,  \nNigh came the wondrous multitude.  \nCelestial in their bright attire  \nSome shone like coals of burning fire;  \nSome were like clouds of dusky smoke;  \nAnd suppliant thus they sweetly spoke:  \n'Thy thralls, O Rama, here we stand:  \nCommand, we pray, thy faithful band'  \n'Depart,' he cried, 'where each may list,  \nBut when I call you to assist,  \nBe present to my mind with speed,  \nAnd aid me in the hour of need.'  \n\nTo Rama then they lowly bent,  \nAnd round him in due reverence went.  \nTo his command, they answered, Yea,  \nAnd as they came so went away.  \nWhen thus the arms had homeward flown,  \nWith pleasant words and modest tone,  \nE'en as he walked, the prince began  \nTo question thus the holy man:  \n'What cloudlike wood is that which near  \nThe mountain's side I see appear?  \nO tell me, for I long to know;  \nIts pleasant aspect charms me so.  \nIts glades are full of deer at play,  \nAnd sweet birds sing on every spray,  \nPast is the hideous wild; I feel  \nSo sweet a tremor o'er me steal,  \nAnd hail with transport fresh and new  \nA land that is so fair to view.  \nThen tell me all, thou holy Sage,  \nAnd whose this pleasant hermitage  \nIn which those wicked ones delight  \nTo mar and kill each holy rite.  \nAnd with foul heart and evil deed  \nThy sacrifice, great Saint, impede.  \nTo whom, O Sage, belongs this land  \nIn which thine altars ready stand!  \n'Tis mine to guard them, and to slay  \nThe giants who the rites would stay.  \nAll this, O best of saints, I burn  \nFrom thine own lips, my lord, to learn.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[42:1](ry032.htm#fr_165) In Sanskrit _Sank ara_, a word which has various\nsignifications but the primary meaning of which is _the act of seizing_. A\nmagical power seems to be implied of employing the weapons when and where\nrequired. The remarks I have made on the preceding Canto apply with still\ngreater force to this. The MSS. greatly vary in the enumeration of these _Sank\naras_, and it is not surprising that copyists have incorrectly written the\nnames which they did not well understand. The commentators throw no light upon\nthe subject.' SCHLEGEL. I have taken the liberty of omitting four of these\nwhich Schlegel translates 'Sclerom* balum, Euomphalium, Cantiventrem, and\nChrysomphalum.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXI: The Perfect Hermitage.](ry033.htm)\n\n"
