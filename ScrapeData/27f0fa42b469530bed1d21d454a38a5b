A man who finds all the hairs of his body standing on end at the bare\nmention of _S_ ri Hari\'s name, through sheer ecstasy, and who sheds tears of\nlove on hearing the name of God, he has reached his last birth.\n\n101\\. The more you scratch the ringworm, the greater grows the itching, and\nthe more pleasure do you find in scratching. Similarly, the devotees once\nbeginning to sing His praises, never get tired of it, but continue for hours\nand hours together.\n\n102\\. When grains are measured out to the purchaser in\n\np. 121\n\nthe granary of a rich merchant, the measurer unceasingly goes on measuring,\nwhile the attending women supply him with basket-fulls of grain from the main\nstore. The measurer does not leave his seat, while the women incessantly\nsupply him with grain. But a small grocer has neither such attendants, nor is\nhis store so inexhaustible. Similarly, it is God Himself who is constantly\ninspiring thoughts and sentiments in the hearts of His devotees, and that is\nthe reason why the latter are never in lack of new and wise thoughts and\nsentiments; while, on the other hand, the book-learned, like petty grocers,\nsoon find that their thoughts have become exhausted.\n\n103\\. A born farmer does not leave off tilling the soil, though it may not\nrain for twelve consecutive years, while a merchant who has but lately taken\nhimself to the plough is discouraged by one season of drought. The true\nbeliever is never discouraged, if even with his lifelong devotion he fails to\nsee God.\n\n104\\. A true devotee who has drunk deep of the Divine Love is like a veritable\ndrunkard, and, as such, cannot always observe the rules of propriety.\n\n105\\. Dala (sedge) does not grow in large and pure water-tanks, but in small\nstagnant and miasmatic pools. Similarly, Dala (schism) does not take place in\na party whose adherents are guided by pure, broad, and unselfish motives, but\nit takes firm root in a party whose advocates are given to selfishness,\ninsincerity, and bigotry. (\'Dala,\' in Bengali, means both sedges and schism.)\n\np. 122\n\n106\\. The Yogins and Sa _m_ yasins are like snakes. The snake never digs a\nhole for itself, but it lives in the hole made by the mouse. When one hole\nbecomes uninhabitable, it enters into another hole. So the Yogins and the Sa\n_m_ yasins make no houses for themselves; they pass their days in other men\'s\nhouses--to-day in one house, to-morrow in another.\n\n107\\. The sage alone can recognise a sage. He who deals in cotton twists can\nalone tell of what number and quality a particular twist is made.\n\n108\\. A sage was lying in a deep trance (Samadhi) by a roadside; a thief\npassing by, saw him, and thought within himself, This fellow, lying here, is a\nthief. He has been breaking into some house by night, and now sleeps\nexhausted. The police will very soon be here to catch him. So let me escape in\ntime.\' Thus thinking, he ran away. Soon after a drunkard came upon the sage,\nand said, Hallo! thou hast fallen into the ditch by taking a drop too much. I\nam steadier than thou, and am not going to tumble.\' Last of all came a sage,\nand understanding that a great sage was in a trance (Samadhi), he sat down,\nand touched him, and began to rub gently his holy feet.\n\n109\\. An itinerant Sadhu came once upon the Kali temple of Rani Rasama _n_ i,\nand seeing a dog eating the remains of a feast, he went up to him and said,\nembracing him, \'Brother, how is it that thou eatest alone, without giving me a\nshare?\' So saying, he began to eat along with the dog. The people of the place\nnaturally thought\n\np. 123\n\nhim mad, but when standing before the temple of the Goddess, he began to chant\nforth some hymns in praise of Kali, and the temple appeared to shake through\nthe fervour of his devotion. Then the people knew him to be a great Sadhu. The\ntrue Sadhus roam about like children or mad men, in dirty clothes, and various\nother disguises.\n\n110\\. The true religious man is he who does not do anything wrong or act\nimpiously when he is alone, i.e. when there is none to look after and blame\nhim.\n\n111\\. In the Bengali alphabet no three letters are alike in sound except the\nthree sibilants ( _S_ a, sha, and sa), all meaning \'forbear,\' \'forbear,\'\n\'forbear.\' This shows that even from our childhood we are made to learn\nforbearance in our very alphabets. The quality of forbearance is of the\nhighest importance to every man.\n\n112\\. Sugar and sand may be mixed together, but the ant rejects the sand and\ngoes off with the sugar-grain; so pious men sift the good from the bad.\n\n113\\. It is the nature of the winnowing basket to reject the bad and keep the\ngood; even such is the case with pious men.\n\n114\\. He is truly a pious man who is dead even in life, i.e. whose passions\nand desires have been all destroyed as in a dead body.\n\n115\\. Worldly persons perform many pious and charitable acts with a hope of\nworldly rewards, but when misfortune, sorrow, and poverty approach them, they\nforget them all.\n\np. 124\n\n[paragraph continues] They are like the parrot that repeats the Divine name\n\'Radha-K _ri_ sh _n_ a, Radha-K _ri_ sh _n_ a\' the livelong day, but cries\n\'Kaw, Kaw\' when caught by a cat, forgetting the Divine name.\n\n116\\. A spring cushion is squeezed down when one sits upon it, but it soon\nresumes its original shape when the pressure is removed. So it is with worldly\nmen. They are full of religious sentiments, so long as they hear religious\ntalks; but no sooner do they enter into the daily routine of the world, than\nthey forget all those high and noble thoughts, and become as impure as before.\n\n117\\. So long as the iron is in the furnace it is red-hot, but it becomes\nblack as soon as it is taken out of the fire. So also is the worldly man. As\nlong as he is in church or in the society of pious people, he is full of\nreligious emotions, but no sooner does he come out of those associations than\nhe loses them all.\n\n118\\. Some one said, \'When my boy Harish grows up, I will get him married, and\ngive him the charge of the family; I shall then renounce the world, and begin\nto practise Yoga.\' At this a Sadhu remarked, \'You will never find any\nopportunity of practising Yoga (devotion). You will say afterwards, "Harish\nand Girish are too much attached to me. They do not like to leave my company\nas yet." Then you will desire perhaps, "Let Harish have a son, and let me see\nthat son married." And thus there will be no end of your desires.\'\n\n119\\. Flies sit at times on the sweetmeats kept exposed\n\np. 125\n\nfor sale in the shop of a confectioner; but no sooner does a sweeper pass by\nwith a basket full of filth than the flies leave the sweetmeats and sit upon\nthe filth-basket. But the honey-bee never sits on filthy objects, and always\ndrinks honey from the flowers. The worldly men are like flies. At times they\nget a momentary taste of Divine sweetness, but their natural tendency for\nfilth soon brings them back to the dunghill of the world. The good man, on the\nother hand, is always absorbed in the beatific contemplation of Divine Beauty.\n\nN.B. The worldly man is like a filthy worm that always lives and dies in\nfilth, and has no idea of higher things; the good man of the world is like the\nfly that sits now on the filth and now on the sweet; while the free soul of a\nYogin is like the bee that always drinks the honey of God\'s holy presence, and\nnothing else.\n\n120\\. When it was argued that a family-man (G _ri_ hastha) may remain in the\nfamily, but may have no concern with it, and consequently may remain\nuncontaminated by the world, an illustration was cited to refute such an\nargument, which is as follows:\n\nA poor Brahma _n_ a once came to one of those family-men, who are unconcerned\nwith family affairs, to beg some money. When the beggar asked of him some\nmoney, he replied, \'Sir, I never touch money. Why are you wasting your time in\nbegging of me?\' The Brahma _n_ a, however, would not go away. Tired with his\nimportunate entreaties the man at last resolved in his mind to give him a\nrupee,\n\np. 126\n\nand told him, \'Well, sir, come to-morrow, I shall see what I can do for you.\'\nThen going in, this typical family-man told his wife, who was the manager of\nall his affairs, he being unconcerned, \'Look here, dear, a poor Brahma _n_ a\nis in great difficulty, and wants something of me. I have made up my mind to\ngive him a rupee. What is your opinion about it?\' \'Aha! what a generous fellow\nyou are!\' she replied, in great excitement at the name of a rupee. \'Rupees are\nnot, like leaves or stones, to be thrown away without any thought.\' \'Well,\ndear,\' replied the husband, in an apologising tone, \'the man is very poor and\nwe should not give him less than a rupee.\' \'No!\' replied the wife, \'I cannot\nspare that much; here is a two-anna-bit and you can give him that, if you\nlike.\' The man of course had no other alternative, being himself unconcerned\nin all such worldly matters, and he took what his wife gave him. Next day the\nbeggar came, and received only a two-anna-bit. Such uncontaminated family-men\nare really henpecked persons who are solely guided by their wives, and as such\nare very poor specimens of humanity.\n\n121\\. Seeing the water pass glittering through the net of bamboo frame-work 1,\nthe small fry enter into it with great pleasure, and having once entered they\ncannot get out again--and are caught. Similarly, foolish men enter into the\nworld allured by its false glitter, but as it is easier to enter the net than\nto get out of it, it is easier to enter the world than renounce it, after\nhaving once entered it.\n\np. 127\n\n122\\. Men always quote the example of the king _G_ anaka, as that of a man who\nlived in the world and yet attained perfection. But throughout the whole\nhistory of mankind there is only this solitary example. His case was not the\nrule, but the exception. The general rule is that no one can attain spiritual\nperfection unless he renounces lust and greed. Do not think yourself to be a\n_G_ anaka. Many centuries have rolled away and the world has not produced\nanother _G_ anaka.\n\n123\\. This world is like a stage, where men perform many parts under various\ndisguises. They do not like to take off the mask, unless they have played for\nsome time. Let them play for a while, and then they will leave off the mask of\ntheir own accord.\n\n124\\. The heart of the devotee is like a dry match; and the slightest mention\nof the name of the Deity kindles the fire of love in his heart. But the mind\nof the worldly, soaked in lust and greed, is like the moist match, and can\nnever be heated to enthusiasm, though God may be preached to him innumerable\ntimes.\n\n125\\. A worldly man may be endowed with intellect as great as that of _G_\nanaka, may take as much pains and trouble as a Yogin, and make as great\nsacrifices as an ascetic; but all these he makes and does, not for God, but\nfor worldliness, honour, and wealth.\n\n126\\. As water does not enter into a stone, so religious advice produces no\nimpression on the heart of a worldly man.\n\np. 128\n\n127\\. As a nail cannot enter into a stone, but can easily be driven into the\nearth, so the advice of the pious does not affect the soul of a worldly man.\nIt enters into the heart of a believer.\n\n128\\. As soft clay easily takes an impression, but not so a stone, so also the\nDivine Wisdom impresses itself on the heart of the devotee, but not on the\nsoul of the worldly man.\n\n129\\. The characteristic of a thoroughly worldly man is that he does not only\nnot listen to hymns, religious discourses, praises of the Almighty, &c., but\nalso prevents others from hearing them, and abuses religious men and\nsocieties, and scoffs at prayers.\n\n130\\. The alligator has got such a thick and scaly hide that no weapons can\npierce it; on the contrary, they fall off harmless. So, howmuchsoever you may\npreach religion to a worldly man, it will have no effect upon his heart.\n\n131\\. As the water enters in on one side under the bridge, and soon passes out\non the other, so religious advice affects worldly souls. It enters into them\nby one ear and goes out by the other, without making any impression upon their\nminds.\n\n132\\. By talking with a worldly man one can feel that his heart is filled with\nworldly thoughts and desires, even as the crop of a pigeon is filled with\ngrains.\n\n133\\. So long as the fire is beneath, the milk boils and bubbles. Remove the\nfire and it is quiet again. So the\n\np. 129\n\nheart of the neophyte boils with enthusiasm, so long as he goes on with his\nspiritual exercises, but afterwards it cools down.\n\n134\\. As to approach a monarch one must ingratiate oneself with the officials\nthat keep the gate and surround the throne, so to reach the Almighty one must\npractise many devotions, as well as serve many devotees and keep the company\nof the wise.\n\n135\\. Keep thy own sentiments and faith to thyself. Do not talk about them\nabroad. Otherwise thou wilt be a great loser.\n\n136\\. There are three kinds of dolls; the first made of salt, the second made\nof cloth, and the third made of stone. If these dolls be immersed in water,\nthe first will get dissolved and lose its form, the second will absorb a large\nquantity of water but retain its form, while the third will be impervious to\nthe water. The first doll represents the man who merges his self in the\nUniversal and All-pervading Self and becomes one with it, that is the \'Mukta\npurusha\'; the second represents a true lover or Bhakta, who is full of Divine\nbliss and knowledge; and the third represents a worldly man, who will not\nabsorb the least drop of true knowledge.\n\n137\\. As when fishes are caught in a net some do not struggle at all, some\nagain struggle hard to come out of the net, while a few are happy enough to\neffect their escape by rending the net; so there are three sorts of men,\n\np. 130\n\nviz. fettered (Baddha), wriggling (Mumukshu), and released (Mukta).\n\n138\\. As sieves separate the finer and coarser parts of a pulverized or ground\nsubstance, keeping the coarser and rejecting the finer, even so the wicked man\ntakes the evil and rejects the good.\n\n139\\. Two men went into a garden. The worldly-wise man no sooner entered the\ngate than he began to count the number of the mango-trees, how many mangoes\neach tree bore, and what might be the approximate price of the whole orchard.\nThe other went to the owner, made his acquaintance, and quietly going under a\nmango-tree began to pluck the fruit and eat it with the owner\'s consent. Now\nwho is the wiser of the two? Eat mangoes, it will satisfy your hunger. What is\nthe good of counting the leaves and making vain calculations? The vain man of\nintellect is uselessly busy in finding out the \'why and wherefore\' of\ncreation, while the humble man of wisdom makes acquaintance with the Creator\nand enjoys Supreme Bliss in this world.\n\n140\\. The vulture soars high up in the air, but all the while he is looking\ndown into the charnel-pits in search of putrid carcasses. So the book-read\npandits speak glibly and volubly about Divine Knowledge, but it is all mere\ntalk, for all the while their mind is thinking about how to get money,\nrespect, honour, power, &c., the vain guerdon of their learning.\n\n141\\. Once a dispute arose in the court of the Maharajah\n\np. 131\n\nof Burdwan among the learned men there, as to who was the greater Deity, _S_\niva or Vish _n_ u. Some gave preference to _S_ iva, others to Vish _n_ u. When\nthe dispute grew hot a wise pandit remarked, addressing the Raja, \'Sire, I\nhave neither met _S_ iva nor seen Vish _n_ u; how can I say who is the greater\nof the two?\' At this the dispute stopped, for none of the disputants really\nhad seen the Deities. Similarly none should compare one Deity with another.\nWhen a man has really seen a Deity, he comes to know that all the Deities are\nmanifestations of one and the same Brahman.\n\n142\\. As the elephant has two sets of teeth, the external tusks and the inner\ngrinders, so the God-men, like _S_ ri K _ri_ sh _n_ a, &c., act and behave to\nall appearances like common men, while their heart and soul rest far beyond\nthe pale of Karman.\n\n143\\. The Sadhu who distributes medicines, and uses in-toxicants, is not a\nproper Sadhu; avoid the company of such.\n\n144\\. A Brahma _n_ a was laying down a garden, and looked after it day and\nnight. One day a cow straying into the garden browsed away a mango sapling\nwhich was one of the most carefully-watched trees of the Brahma _n_ a. The\nBrahma _n_ a seeing the cow destroy his favourite plant gave it such a sound\nbeating that it died of the injuries received, The news soon spread like\nwildfire that the Brahma _n_ a killed the sacred animal.\n\nNow the Brahma _n_ a was a so-called Vedantist, and when taxed with the sin\ndenied it, saying,--\'No, I have not\n\np. 132\n\nkilled the cow; it is my hand that has done it, and as Indra is the presiding\nDeity of the hand, so if any one has incurred the guilt of killing the cow, it\nis Indra and not I.\'\n\nIndra in his Heaven heard all this, assumed the shape of an old Brahma _n_ a,\ncame to the owner of the garden, and said, \'Sir, whose garden is this?\'\n\nBrahma _n_ a--\' Mine.\'\n\nIndra--\' It is a beautiful garden. You have got a skilful gardener, for see\nhow neatly and artistically he has planted the trees!\'\n\nBrahma _n_ a--\' Well, sir, that is also my work. The trees are planted under\nmy personal supervision and direction.\'\n\nIndra--\' Indeed! O, you are very clever. But who has laid out this road? It is\nvery ably planned and neatly executed.\'\n\nBrahma _n_ a--\' All this has been done by me.\'\n\nThen Indra with joined hands said, \'When all these things are yours, and you\ntake credit for all the works done in this garden, it is hard lines for poor\nIndra to be held responsible for the killing of the cow.\'\n\n145\\. If thou art in right earnest to be good and perfect, God will send the\ntrue and proper Master (Sad-Guru) to thee. Earnestness is the only thing\nnecessary.\n\n146\\. As when going to a strange country, one must abide by the directions of\nhim who knows the way, while taking the advice of many may lead to confusion,\nso in trying to reach God one should follow implicitly the advice of one\nsingle Guru who knows the way to God.\n\np. 133\n\n147\\. Whoever can call on the Almighty with sincerity and intense earnestness\nneeds no Guru. But such a man is rare, hence the necessity of a Guru or Guide.\nThe Guru should be only one, but Upagurus (assistant Gurus) may be many. He\nfrom whom any thing whatsoever is learned is an Upaguru. The great Avadhuta\nhad twenty-four such Gurus.\n\n148\\. Many roads lead to Calcutta. A certain man started from his home in a\ndistant village towards the metropolis. He asked a man on the road, \'What road\nmust I take to reach Calcutta soon?\' The man said, \'Follow this road.\'\nProceeding some distance, he met another man and asked him, \'Is this the\nshortest road to Calcutta?\' The man replied, \'O, no! You must retrace your\nfootsteps and take the road to your left.\' The man did so. Going in that new\nroad for some distance he met a third man who pointed him out another road to\nCalcutta. Thus the traveller made no progress, but spent the day in changing\none road for another. As he wanted to reach Calcutta he should have stuck to\nthe road pointed out to him by the first man. Similarly those who want to\nreach God must follow one and one only Guide.\n\n149\\. The disciple should never criticise his own Guru. He must implicitly\nobey whatever his Guru says. Says a Bengali couplet:\n\nThough my Guru may visit tavern and still,  \nMy Guru is holy Rai Nityananda still.\n\n150\\. The Guru is a mediator. He brings man and God together.\n\np. 134\n\n151\\. Take the pearl and throw the oyster-shell away. Follow the mantra\n(advice) given thee by thy Guru and throw out of consideration the human\nfrailties of thy teacher.\n\n152\\. Listen not, if any one criticises and censures thy Guru. Leave his\npresence at once.\n\n153\\. As the moon is the uncle of every child, so God is the Father and Guide\nof the whole Humanity. (The children in Bengal call the moon their \'maternal\nuncle.\')\n\n154\\. A disciple, having firm faith in the infinite power of his Guru, walked\nover a river even by pronouncing his name. The Guru, seeing this, thought\nwithin himself, \'Well, is there such a power even in my name? Then I must be\nvery great and powerful, no doubt!\' The next day he also tried to walk over\nthe river pronouncing \'I, I, I,\' but no sooner had he stepped into the waters\nthan he sank and was drowned. Faith can achieve miracles, while vanity or\negoism is the death of man.\n\n155\\. Gurus can be had by hundreds, but good Chelas (disciples) are very rare.\n\n156\\. It is easy to utter \'do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si,\' by mouth, but not so\neasy to sing or play them on any instrument. So it is easy to talk religion,\nbut it is difficult to act religion.\n\n157\\. Common men talk bagfuls of religion, but act not a grain of it, while\nthe wise man speaks little, but his whole life is a religion acted out.\n\np. 135\n\n158\\. What you wish others to do, do yourself.\n\n159\\. Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he who yearns for God, finds Him.\n\n160\\. The petals of the lotus drop off in time, but they leave scars behind.\nSo when true knowledge comes egoism goes off, but its traces remain. These,\nhowever, are not at all active for evil.\n\n161\\. There are two Egos in man, one ripe and the other unripe. The ripe Ego\nthinks, \'Nothing is mine; whatever I see, or feel, or hear, nay, even this\nbody is not mine, I am always free and eternal.\' The unripe Ego, on the\ncontrary, thinks, \'This is my house, my room, my child, my wife, my body, &c.\'\n\n162\\. The cup in which garlic juice is kept retains the nasty odour, though it\nmay be rubbed and scoured hundreds of times. Egohood also is such an obstinate\ncreature. It never leaves us completely.\n\n163\\. The leaves of the cocoa-palm fall off, but leave still their marks\nbehind on the trunk. Similarly, so long as one has this body, there will\nremain the mark of egoism, how high soever a man may advance in spirituality.\nBut these traces of egoism do not bind such men to the world nor cause their\nre-birth.\n\n164\\. The sun can give heat and light to the whole world, but it can do\nnothing when the clouds are in the sky and shut out its rays, Similarly, so\nlong as egoism is in the soul, God cannot shine upon the heart.\n\np. 136\n\n165\\. Vanity is like a heap of rubbish or ashes on which the water, as soon as\nit falls, dries away. Prayers and contemplations produce no effect upon the\nheart puffed up with vanity.\n\n166\\. Of all the birds of the air the crow is considered to be the wisest, and\nhe thinks himself so too. He never falls into a snare. He flies off at the\nslightest approach of danger, and steals the food with the greatest dexterity.\nBut all this wisdom can supply him with no better living than filth and foul\nmatter. This is the result of his having the wisdom of the pettifogger.\n\n167\\. Once upon a time conceit entered the heart of the Divine Sage Narada,\nand he thought there was no greater devotee than himself. Reading his heart,\nthe Lord _S_ ri Vish _n_ u said, \'Narada, go to such and such a place, there\nis a great Bhakta of mine there, and cultivate his acquaintance.\' Narada went\nthere and found an agriculturist, who rose early in the morning, pronounced\nthe name of Hari only once, and taking his plough went out to till the ground\nall day long. At night he went to bed after pronouncing the name of Hari once\nmore. Narada said within himself, \'How can this rustic be called a lover of\nGod? I see him busily engaged in worldly duties, and he has no signs of a\npious man in him.\' Narada then went back to the Lord and said all he thought\nof his new acquaintance. The Lord said, \'Narada, take this cup full of oil, go\nround this city and come back with it, but beware lest a drop of it fall to\nthe ground.\' Narada did as he was told, and on his\n\np. 137\n\nreturn he was asked, \'Well, Narada, how often did you remember me in your\nwalk?\' \'Not once, my Lord,\' replied Narada, \'and how could I when I had to\nwatch this cup brimming over with oil?\' The Lord then said, \'This one cup of\noil did so divert your attention that even you did forget me altogether, but\nlook to that rustic who, carrying the heavy load of a family, still remembers\nme twice every day.\'\n\n168\\. There are three kinds of love, selfish, mutual, and unselfish. The\nselfish love is the lowest. It only looks towards its own happiness, no matter\nwhether the beloved suffers weal or woe. In mutual love the lover not only\nwants the happiness of his or her beloved, but has an eye towards his or her\nown happiness also. The unselfish love is of the highest kind. The lover only\nminds the welfare of the beloved.\n\n169\\. A true lover sees his God as his nearest and dearest relative, just as\nthe shepherd women of V _ri_ ndavana saw in _S_ ri K _ri_ sh _n_ a, not the\nLord of the Universe ( _G_ agannatha), but their own beloved (Gopinatha).\n\n170\\. \'I must attain perfection in this life, yea, in three days I must find\nGod; nay, with a single utterance of His name I will draw Him to me.\' With\nsuch a violent love the Lord is attracted soon. The lukewarm lovers take ages\nto go to Him, if at all.\n\n171\\. A lover and a knower of God were once passing through a forest. On their\nway they saw a tiger at a distance. The _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ anin or knower of God said,\n\'There\n\np. 138\n\nis no reason why we should flee; the Almighty God will certainly protect us.\'\nAt this the lover said, \'No, brother, come let us run away. Why should we\ntrouble the Lord for what can be accomplished by our own exertions?\'\n\n172\\. The Knowledge of God may be likened to a man, while the Love of God is\nlike a woman. Knowledge has entry only up to the outer rooms of God, but no\none can enter into the inner mysteries of God save a lover, for a woman has\naccess even into the harem of the Almighty.\n\n173\\. Knowledge and love of God are ultimately one and the same. There is no\ndifference between pure knowledge and pure love.\n\n174\\. A group of fisherwomen on their way home from a distant market held on\nan afternoon, were overtaken by a heavy hailstorm at nightfall in the middle\nof their way, and so were compelled to take shelter in a florist\'s house near\nat hand. Through the kindness of the florist they were allowed to sleep that\nnight in one of his rooms, where some baskets of sweet-smelling flowers had\nbeen kept for supplying his customers. The atmosphere of the room was too good\nfor the fisherwomen, and they could not, owing to it, get even a wink of\nsleep, till one of them suggested a remedy by saying, \'Let each of us keep her\nempty basket of fish close to her nose, and thus prevent this troublesome\nsmell of flowers from attacking our nostrils and killing our sleep.\' Every one\ngladly agreed to the proposal, and did accordingly; and soon all began to\nsnore. Such, indeed, is\n\np. 139\n\nthe power and influence of bad habits over all those who are addicted to them.\n\n175\\. A tame mungoose had its home high up on the wall of a house. One end of\na rope was tied to its neck, while the other end was fastened to a weight. The\nmungoose with the appendage runs and plays in the parlour or in the yard of\nthe house, but no sooner does it get frightened than it at once runs up and\nhides itself in its home on the wall. But it cannot stay there long, as the\nweight at the other end of the rope draws it down, and it is constrained to\nleave its home. Similarly, a man has his home high up at the feet of the\nAlmighty. Whenever he is frightened by adversity and misfortune he goes up to\nhis God, his true home; but in a short time he is constrained to come down\ninto the world by its irresistible attractions.\n\n176\\. As Heloncha ( _Hingcha repens_ ) should not be counted among pot-herbs,\nor sugar-candy among common sweets, because even a sick man can use them\nwithout injuring his health; or as the pra _n_ ava ( ![](img/13900.jpg)) is\nnot to be counted as a word, but as Divinity itself; so the desires of\nholiness, devotion, and love are not to be reckoned as desires at all.\n\n177\\. When the fruit grows the petals drop off of themselves. So when the\nDivinity in thee increases, the weakness of humanity in thee will vanish.\n\n178\\. The new-born calf falls and tumbles down scores of times before it\nlearns to stand steady. So in the path of devotion, the slips are many before\nsuccess is achieved.\n\np. 140\n\n179\\. Some get tipsy with even a small glass of wine. Others require two or\nthree bottles to make them intoxicated. But both get equal and full pleasure\nof intoxication. Similarly, some devotees get intoxicated with celestial bliss\nby coming in direct contact with the Lord of the Universe, while others become\nfull of ecstasy even by a glimpse of the Divine Glory. But both are equally\nfortunate, since both are deluged with Divine bliss.\n\n180\\. The snake is very venomous. It bites when any one approaches to catch\nit. But the person who has learnt the snake-charm can not only catch a snake,\nbut carries about several of them like so many ornaments. Similarly, he who\nhas acquired spiritual knowledge can never be polluted by lust and greed.\n\n181\\. When a man realises one of the following states he becomes perfect:--(1)\nAll this am I; (2) All this art thou; (3) Thou the Master, and I the servant.\n\n182\\. Thou shouldst sacrifice thy body, mind, and riches, to find God.\n\n183\\. Humanity must die before Divinity manifests itself. But this Divinity\nmust, in turn, die before the higher manifestation of the Blissful Mother\ntakes place. It is on the bosom of dead Divinity ( _S_ iva) that the Blissful\nMother dances Her dance celestial.\n\n184\\. He finds God the quickest whose yearning and concentration are the\ngreatest.\n\n185\\. Samadhi is the state of bliss which is experienced\n\np. 141\n\nby a live fish which, being kept out of water for some time, is again put into\nit.\n\n186\\. There are hills and mountains, dales and valleys, under the sea, but\nthey are not visible from the surface. So in the state of Samadhi, when one\nfloats upon the ocean of Sat- _k_ it-ananda, all human consciousness lies\nlatent in him.\n\n187\\. If you fill an earthen vessel with water, and set it apart upon a shelf,\nthe water in it will dry up in a few days; but if you place the same pot into\nwater it will remain filled as long as it is kept there. Even such is the case\nwith your love to the Lord God. Fill and enrich your bosom with the love of\nGod for a time, and then employ yourself in other affairs, forgetting Him all\nthe while, and then you are sure to find within a short time that your heart\nhas become poor and vacant and devoid of that precious love. But if you keep\nyour heart immersed always in the depth of that holy love, your heart is sure\nto remain ever full to overflowing with the Divine fervour of sacred love.\n\n188\\. He who at the time of contemplation is entirely unconscious of\neverything outside, has acquired the perfection of contemplation.\n\n189\\. A jar kept in water is full of water inside and outside. Similarly the\nsoul immersed in God sees the all-pervading spirit within and without.\n\n190\\. When the grace of the Almighty descends, every\n\np. 142\n\none will understand his mistakes; knowing this you should not dispute.\n\n191\\. The darkness of centuries is dispersed at once as soon as a light is\nbrought into the room. The accumulated ignorances and misdoings of innumerable\nbirths vanish before the single glance of the Almighty\'s gracious look.\n\n192\\. When the Malaya breeze blows, all trees, having stamina in them, become\nconverted into sandal-trees; but those which have no stamina remain unchanged\nas before, like bamboo, plantain, palm-tree, &c. So when Divine Grace\ndescends, men having the germs of piety and goodness in them are changed at\nonce into holy beings and are filled with Divinity, but worthless and worldly\nmen remain as before.\n\n193\\. As the dawn heralds in the rising sun, so unselfishness, purity,\nrighteousness, &c., precede the advent of the Lord.\n\n194\\. As a king, before going to the house of his servant, sends from his own\nstores the necessary seats, ornaments, food, &c., to his servant, so that the\nlatter may properly receive him; so before the Lord cometh, He sends love,\nreverence, faith, yearning, &c., into the heart of the devotee.\n\n195\\. Shallow water in an open field will in time be dried up though no one\nmay lessen it by using it. So a sinner is sometimes purified by simply\nresigning himself totally and absolutely to the mercy and grace of God.\n\np. 143\n\n196\\. A policeman can see with a dark lantern (bull\'s-eye) every one upon whom\nhe throws the rays, but no one can see him so long as he does not turn the\nlight towards himself. So does God see every one, but no one seeth Him until\nthe Lord revealeth Himself to him in His mercy.\n\n197\\. There are some fish which have many sets of bones, and others have one;\nbut as the eater cleans all the bones and eats the fish, so some men have many\nsins and others have few; but the grace of God purifies them all in time.\n\n198\\. The breeze of His grace is blowing night and day over thy head. Unfurl\nthe sails of thy boat (mind) if thou wantest to make rapid progress through\nthe ocean of life.\n\n199\\. Fans should be discarded when the wind blows. Prayers and penances\nshould be discarded when the grace of God descends.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[126:1](rls26.htm#fr_15) A trap for catching small fish.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Sayings of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a: 200-299](rls27.htm)\n\n'
