Now that Agni whom they\nat first chose for the office of Hot _ri_ priest passed away. He also whom\nthey chose the second time passed away. He also whom they chose the third time\npassed away 2. Thereupon the one who still constitutes the fire in our own\ntime, concealed himself from fear. He entered into the waters. Him the gods\ndiscovered and brought forcibly away from the waters. He spat upon the waters,\nsaying, \'Bespitten are ye who are an unsafe place of refuge, from whom they\ntake me away against my will!\' Thence sprung the \xc3\x82ptya deities, Trita, Dvita,\nand Ekata.\n\n1:2:3:22\\. They roamed about with Indra, even as nowadays a Brahman follows in\nthe train of a king. When he slew Vi _s_ varupa, the three-headed son of Tvash\n_t_ _ri_ , they also knew of his going to be killed.; and straightway Trita\nslew him. Indra, assuredly, was free from that (sin), for he is a god 3.\n\np. 48\n\n1:2:3:33\\. And the people thereupon said: \'Let those be guilty of the sin who\nknew about his going to be killed! \'How?\' they asked. \'The sacrifice shall\nwipe it off upon (shall transfer it to) them!\' they said. Hence the sacrifice\nthereby wipes off upon them (the guilt or impurity incurred in the preparation\nof the offering), when they pour out for them the water with which the dish\nhas been rinsed, and that in which he (the Adhvaryu) has washed his fingers.\n\n1:2:3:44\\. And the \xc3\x82ptyas then said: \'Let us make this pass on beyond us!\' \'On\nwhom?\' they asked. \'On him who shall make an offering without a dakshi _n_ a\n(gift to the officiating priests)!\' they said. Hence one must not make an\noffering without a dakshi _n_ a; for the sacrifice wipes (the guilt) off upon\nthe \xc3\x82ptyas, and the \xc3\x82ptyas wipe it off upon him who makes an offering without\na dakshi _n_ a.\n\n1:2:3:55\\. Thereupon the gods ordained this to be the\n\np. 49\n\ndakshi _n_ a at the new- and full-moon sacrifices, to wit, the Anvaharya mess\nof rice 1, \'lest the oblation should be without a dakshi _n_ a.\' That (rinsing\nwater) he pours out (for each \xc3\x82ptya) separately: thus he avoids a quarrel\namong them. He makes it hot (previously) 2: thus it becomes boiled (drinkable)\nfor them. He pours it out with the formulas, \'For Trita thee!\' \'For Dvita\nthee!\' \'For Ekata thee!\'--Now it is as an animal sacrifice that this\nsacrificial cake is offered 3.\n\np. 50\n\n1:2:3:66\\. At first, namely, the gods offered up a man as the victim 1. When\nhe was offered up, the sacrificial essence went out of him. It entered into\nthe horse. They offered up the horse. When it was offered up, the sacrificial\nessence went out of it. It entered into the ox. They offered up the ox. When\nit was offered up, the sacrificial essence went out of it. It entered into the\nsheep. They offered up the sheep. When it was offered up, the sacrificial\nessence went out of it. It entered into the goat. They offered up the goat.\nWhen it was offered up, the sacrificial essence went out of it.\n\n1:2:3:77\\. It entered into this earth. They searched for it, by digging. They\nfound it (in the shape of) those two (substances), the rice and barley:\ntherefore even now they obtain those two by digging; and as much\n\np. 51\n\nefficacy as all those sacrificed animal victims would have for him, so much\nefficacy has this oblation (of rice &c.) for him who knows this. And thus\nthere is in this oblation also that completeness which they call \'the fivefold\nanimal sacrifice.\'\n\n1:2:3:88\\. When it (the rice-cake) still consists of rice-meal, it is the hair\n1. When he pours water on it, it becomes skin 2. When he mixes it, it becomes\nflesh: for then it becomes consistent; and consistent also is the flesh. When\nit is baked, it becomes bone: for then it becomes somewhat hard; and hard is\nthe bone. And when he is about to take it off (the fire) and sprinkles it with\nbutter, he changes it into marrow. This is the completeness which they call\n\'the fivefold animal sacrifice.\'\n\n1:2:3:99\\. The man (purusha) whom they had offered up became a mock-man (kim-\npurusha 3). Those two, the horse and the ox, which they had sacrificed,\n\np. 52\n\nbecame a bos gaurus and a gayal (bos gavaeus) respectively. The sheep which\nthey had sacrificed, became a camel. The goat which they had sacrificed,\nbecame a _s_ arabha [1](sbe1210.htm#fn_180). For this reason one should not\neat (the flesh) of these animals, for these animals are deprived of the\nsacrificial essence (are impure).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[47:2](sbe1209.htm#fr_171) In I, 3, 3, 13-16, the three former Agnis (or the\nthree brothers of Agni, acc. to Mahidh., Va _g_. S. II, 2) are said to have\nfled from fear of the thunderbolt, in the shape of the vasha _t_ formula.\n\n[47:3](sbe1209.htm#fr_172) Cf. I, 6, 3, 1 seq. In the Taitt. Sarah. II, 5, 1,\n1, Vi _s_ varupa, the Tvash _t_ ra, is said to have been a sister\'s son of the\nAsuras, and p. 48 house-priest (purohita) to the gods, and to have been killed\nby Indra, because he had secretly contrived to let the oblations go to the\nAsuras, instead of to the gods. Thus by killing him, Indra (or Trita,\naccording to our version of the legend) became guilty of that most hideous\ncrime, the brahmahatya, or killing of a Brahma _n_ a. Trita, the \xc3\x82ptya (i.e.\nprobably \'sprung from, or belonging to the ap, or waters of the atmosphere\'),\nseems to have been a prominent figure of the early Indo-Iranian mythology, the\nprototype, in many respects, of Indra, the favourite god of the Vedic hymns.\nThe notion of wishing evil and misfortune away to Trita, or far, far away, is\na familiar one to the Vedic bards. The name Traitana also occurs once in Rig-\nveda (I, 158, 5), though in a rather dark passage. On the connection between\nTrita (? Traitana) and the Iranian Thraetona (Feridun), son of Athvya, see E.\nBurnouf, Journ. Asiat. V, 120; R. Roth, Zeitschr. d. Deutsch. Morg. Ges. II,\np. 216 seq. Dvita (the second) and Ekata are no doubt later abstractions\nsuggested by the etymology of the name Trita (the third), although the former,\nDvita, occurs already in the Vedic hymns.\n\n[49:1](sbe1209.htm#fr_173) The Anvaharya consists of boiled rice prepared from\nthe rice-grains that remain after the sacrificial cakes have been prepared. It\nis put on the Dakshi _n_ a fire by the Adhvaryu for cooking after covering\nover the cakes and pouring out the water. Katy. II, 5, 27. Saya _n_ a explains\nthe term as \'that which takes away (anva-h _ri_ ) from the sacrificer the\nguilt incurred by mistakes during the sacrifice;\' but the St. Petersburg\nDictionary offers the more probable explanation of it as \'that which serves to\nsupplement (anva-h _ri_ ) the sacrifice.\'\n\n[49:2](sbe1209.htm#fr_174) According to Saya _n_ a \'he makes the poured-out\nwater hot with a coal.\' Katyayana (II, 5, 26) and his commentators, on the\nother hand, supply the following particulars: \'Having heated (with straw\nlighted in the Garhapatya) the water which has been used for washing the dish\nand hands, he pours it out for the \xc3\x82ptyas (from east to west into three lines\ndrawn with the wooden sword from west to east, north of the sacrificial\nground) in such a manner that it does not flow together, with the formulas,\n"For Trita thee!" &c., respectively.\'\n\n[49:3](sbe1209.htm#fr_175) That is to say, the sacrificial cake is a\nsubstitute or symbol (pratima) for the animal sacrifice (as this it would seem\nwas originally a substitute for the human sacrifice) by which the sacrificer\nredeems himself from the gods. Cf. _S_ at. Br. XI, 1, 8, 3; Taitt. Br. III, 2,\n8, 8. The initiation (diksha) of the sacrificer constitutes his consecration\nas the victim at the animal sacrifice ( _S_ at. Br. XI, 7, 1, 3; Ait. Br. II,\n3; 9; 11; Taitt. Br. II, 2, 82; T. S. VI, 1, 11, 6; Kaush. Br. X, 3; XI, 8),\nor as the sacrificial food at the havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a ( _S_ at. Br. III, 3, 4,\n21; Taitt, Br. III, 2, 8, 9), or as the horse at the horse-sacrifice (Taitt.\nBr. III, 9, 17, 4-5), &c. See, also, Taitt. S. VII, 2, 30, 4; Ka _th_. 34, 11,\nwhere it is said that one must p. 50 not perform the dvada _s_ aha for any\none, since in having to eat of the victim, the cake, &c., one would eat the\nsacrificer\'s own flesh, &c. Cf. Weber, Ind. Streifen, I, p. 73. In accordance\nwith these notions it would seem that man originally sacrificed his equal, as\nthe best substitute for his own self; and that, as advancing civilisation\nrendered human sacrifices distasteful, the human victim was supplied by\ndomestic animals, ennobled by constant contact with man; and finally by\nvarious materials of human diet.\n\n[50:1](sbe1209.htm#fr_176) On this legend and the one in the Ait. Br. II, 8,\nbut slightly differing from ours, see Max Muller\'s History of Ancient Sanskrit\nLiterature, p. 420; A. Weber\'s Ind. Streifen, I, p. 55; Haug\'s Transl. of the\nAit. Br. p. 90; J. Muir\'s Original Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 289 note. Professor\nMax Muller remarks: \'The drift of this story is most likely that in former\ntimes all these victims had been offered. We know it for certain in the case\nof horses and oxen, though afterwards these sacrifices were discontinued. As\nto sheep and goats, they were considered proper victims to a still later time.\nWhen vegetable offerings took the place of bloody victims, it was clearly the\nwish of the author of our passage to show that, for certain sacrifices, these\nrice-cakes were as efficient as the flesh of animals.\' Cf. also II, 1, 4, 3.\n\n[51:1](sbe1209.htm#fr_177) According to Saya _n_ a, because, like the hair of\nthe victim, the particles of the ground rice are minute and numerous.\nAccording to Ait. Br. II, 9, on the other hand, the awn or beard of the rice\nrepresents the hair; the husks the skin; the minute particles of chaff removed\nby the final winnowings, the blood; the ground rice the flesh; and \'whatever\nother substantial part is in the rice\' are the bones of the victim.\n\n[51:2](sbe1209.htm#fr_178) \'Because it becomes as flexible as skin,\' Saya _n_\na.\n\n[51:3](sbe1209.htm#fr_179) It is doubtful what particular kind of being the\nterm kimpurusha (depraved man) is here intended to denote. The authors of the\nSt. Petersburg Dictionary, whom Professor Weber follows (Ind. Stud. IX, 246),\ntake it (probably correctly) to denote \'a monkey.\' Professor Haug, on the\nother hand, in his translation of the corresponding passage in the Ait. Br.\nII, 8, thinks \'the author very likely meant a dwarf,\' whilst Professor Max\nMuller (History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 420) translates it by \'a\nsavage.\' Perhaps one of the species of apes which particularly resemble man,\nis intended by it. Cf. Weber, Omina et Portenta, P. 356.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe1210.htm)\n\n'
