Vidyujjihva obeyed,  \nAnd wondrous magic skill displayed;  \nAnd Ravan for the art he showed  \nAn ornament of price bestowed.  \nThen to the grove where Sita lay  \nThe lord of Lanka took his way.  \nPale, wasted, weeping, on the ground  \nThe melancholy queen he found,  \nWhose thoughts in utmost stress of ill  \nWere fixed upon her husband still.  \nThe giant king approached the dame,  \nDeclared in tones of joy his name;  \nThen heeding naught her wild distress  \nBespake her, stern and pitiless:  \n  "The prince to whom thy fancies cling  \nThough loved and wooed by Lanka\'s king,  \nWho slew the noble Khara,--he  \nIs slain by warriors sent by me.  \nThy living root is hewn away.  \nThy scornful pride is tamed to-day.  \nThy lord in battle\'s front has died,  \nAnd Sita shall be Ravan\'s bride.  \nHence, idle thoughts: thy hope is fled;  \nWhat wilt thou, Sita, with the dead?  \nRise, child of Janak, rise and be  \nThe queen of all my queens and me.  \nIncline thine ear, and I will tell,  \nDear lady, how thy husband fell.  \nHe bridged his way across the sea  \nWith countless troops to fight with me.  \nThe setting sun had flushed the west  \nWhen on the shore they took their rest.  \nWeary with toil no watch they kept,  \nSecurely on the sand they slept.  \nPrahasta\'s troops assailed our foes,  \nAnd smote them in their deep repose.  \nScarce could their bravest prove their might;  \nThey perished in the dark of night.  \nAxe, spear, and sword, directed well,  \nUpon the sleeping myriads fell.  \nFirst in the fight Prahasta\'s sword  \nReft of his head thy slumbering lord,  \nRoused at the din Vibhishan rose,  \nThe captive of surrounding foes,  \nAnd Lakshman through the woods that spread  \nAround him with his Vanars fled.  \nHanuman fell: one deadly stroke  \nThe neck of King Sugriva broke  \nAnd Maunta sank, and Dwivil lay  \nGasping in hand his life away.  \nThe Vanars died, or fled dispersed  \n\nLike cloudlets when the storm has burst.  \nSome rose aloft in air, and more  \nRan to the sea and filled the shore.  \nOn shore, in woods, on hill and plain  \nOur conquering giants left the slain.  \nThus my victorious host o\'erthrew  \nThe Vanars, and thy husband slew:  \nSee, rudely stained with dust, and red  \nWith dropping blood, the severed head."  \n   Then, turning to a Rakshas slave,  \nThe ruthless king his mandate gave;  \nAnd straight Vidyujjihva who bore  \nThe head still wet with dripping gore,  \nThe arrows and the mighty bow,  \nBent down before his master low.  \n  \'Vidyujjihva,\' cried Ravan, \'place  \nThe head before the lady\'s\'face,  \nAnd let her see with weeping eyes  \nThat low in death her husband lies.\'  \n   Before the queen the giant laid  \nThe beauteous head his art had made.  \nAnd Ravan cried: \'Thine eyes will know  \nThese arrows and the mighty bow.  \nWith fame of this by Rama strung  \nThe earth and heaven and hell have rung.  \nPrahasta brought it hither when  \nHis hand had slain thy prince of men.  \nNow, widowed Queen, thy hopes resign:  \nForget thy husband and be mine.\'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[450:1](ry429.htm#fr_953) I omit the rest of this canto, which is mere\nrepetition. Ravan gives in the same words his former answer that the Gods,\nGandharvas and fiends combined shall not force him to give up Sita. He then\norders S\'ardula to tell him the names of the Vanar chieftains whom he has seen\nin Rama\'s army. These have already been mentioned by S\'uka and Saran.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXII.: Sita\'s Lament.](ry431.htm)\n\n'
