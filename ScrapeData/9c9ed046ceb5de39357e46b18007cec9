He spent the day\nin bathing, meditation, worship and prayer, and the night in vigil. When six\nghurees of the night remained, and the twelfth day of the lunar fortnight had\nbegun, having got up, and purified his body, and perceiving that it was day-\nbreak, he took a bathing cloth and ewer, and went to the Jumna to bathe: many\ncowherds followed him. Having gone upon the bank, made a salutation and taken\noff his clothes, as Nund Jee went into the water, the servants of Varoonu, who\nwere guarding the stream, that no one might bathe at night, went to Varoonu,\nand said, "O great king! some one is now bathing in the Jumna: what are your\norders to us on the subject?" Varoonu replied, "Lay hold of him, and bring him\nhere." On receiving this order, the servants returned to the spot where Nund\nJee having performed his ablutions was standing in the water, muttering\nprayers. The servants coming, and having quickly thrown a. noose over Nund\nJee, took him to Varoonu. Then the cowherds, who accompanied Nund Jee, came to\nKrishnu and said, "O great king! the attendants of Varoonu have carried off\nNund Rae Jee from the banks of the Jumna to the region of\n\np. 96\n\n[paragraph continues] Varoonu." On hearing this, Shree Krishnu got up enraged,\nand went off, and arrived in a second at the abode of Varoonu. On beholding\nhim, Varoonu rose and stood up, and joining his hands, said in a supplicating\nmanner, "My birth has this day been propitious, (that is, all the objects of\nmy present birth have been gained to-day,) by my having obtained a sight of\nyou, O lord of the Judoos! Put away far front me all my crimes, I have\ncircumvented Nund, your father, with this object in view. You are celebrated\nas the father of all. We know not your father. Seeing Nund bathing at night,\nmy attendants through ignorance laid hold of him. Well, by stratagem, I have\nobtained a sight of you; be pleased now to have mercy on me, and do not think\nof my crime." Being thus humble, and having brought many presents, which he\nplaced before Nund Jee and Shree Krishnu, when Varoonu with hands joined, and\nhaving bowed his head, stood before them, Shree Krishnu, having taken the\npresents, returned thence to Brindabun, accompanied by his father. On seeing\nthem, all the inhabitants of Bruj came crowding together. The cowherds\nenquired from Nund Rae, "Where did the attendants of Varoonu carry you to?"\nNund Jee replied, "Shree Krishnu arrived just as they had laid hold of me, and\ntaken me to Varoonu\'s. On seeing him, Varoonu having descended from his\nthrone, and fallen at his feet, said with the greatest supplication of manner,\nLord! pardon my offence, I have committed this crime through ignorance, which\nbe pleased not to cast a thought upon."\n\nHearing this speech of Nund Jee\'s, the cowherds said to each other, "Brother!\nwhen Shree Krishnu Chund by supporting the hill protected Bruj, we knew that\nVishnu had descended on the earth in the house of Nund, our chief."\n\nConversing thus amongst themselves, all the cowherds with hands joined, said\nto Shree Krishnu, "O great king! you have deceived us for a long time, but now\nwe have found out all your secrets, you are the creator of the world, and the\n\np. 97\n\nremover of all affliction. O lord of the three worlds! be so kind as to show\nus the paradise of Vishnu."\n\nOn hearing this, Shree Krishnu Jee, having in a second made a paradise,\nexhibited it to them in Bruj. On beholding it, the inhabitants of Bruj became\npossessed of knowledge; and they said with hands joined, and bended heads,\n"Lord! your greatness is infinite; we cannot speak of it, but through your\ngoodness we have this day discovered, that you are Narayun, and have been born\nin the world to remove the burthens of the earth."\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! when the inhabitants of Bruj had thus\nspoken, Shree Krishnu Chund, having brought them all under the influence of\ncharms and fascination, carried off the paradise which he had just created for\ntheir inspection, and made his own deceptive power vanish. All the cowherds\nthought what had happened a dream; and Nund Jee, being under the power of\ndelusion, regarded Shree Krishnu as his own son.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXX](psa31.htm)\n\n'
