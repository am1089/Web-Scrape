No decalogue has half the influence over human conduct\nthat is exercised by a single drama or a page of narrative. The theory of\nchivalry interests us, but the _Idylls of the King_ help to mould our\ncharacter.\n\nThe whole of history, in so far as it may be known, is the common possession\nof the race; but, in addition to this, every language makes its own\ncontribution of literary creations, and national custom determines the degree\nin which these shall become available to all classes of the community, thereby\nreacting upon the national type. Few have considered how much might be done to\nennoble and dignify common life in England by a wider dispersion of the love\nfor Shakespeare. As it is, the Bible being the only book that is used in this\nsense, the careers and opinions of a few Syrian shepherds are apt to be more\npotent among us than that great Brutus, Desdemona, Horatio and their kindred,\nwho are the offspring of the genius of our countryman, and in some sense\ntherefore the fruit of English civic life itself.\n\nIt is said that in Greece the poetry of Homer and Euripides is known amongst\nthe poorer classes to this day; and certain it is that the Catholic Church has\ndone a great and little-understood service, in\n\np. 96\n\nbringing the lives of the saints of all countries to bear upon the development\nof each. Every man habitually measures himself against some model, therefore\nevery addition to the range of available types is to be welcomed. A king feels\nhimself to be one of a class of royal persons who must be not only\nauthoritative but also picturesque in their behaviour. And, whether he likes\nit or not, by this standard he knows himself to stand or fall. His very rank\nforces his pattern upon him. Amongst those of smaller place and greater\npersonal freedom, capacity more readily shows its own complexion. Some of us,\nwere our commonplace faculties touched with divine fire, would find our\ndestiny in the qualities of the ideal merchant and administrator. That\npeculiar form of integrity, dignity, and wisdom that belongs to such a\nfunction would prove to be ours, or attainable by us. But although this is\nprobably the commonest logical issue in English national life at present, it\ndoes not follow that every Englishman is fitted to achieve it. Here and there,\nespecially perhaps among the Celtic contingent, we find one born for the quite\ndifferent goal of perfect knighthood. Loyalty to leader and comrade, sympathy\nfor the oppressed, far-shining fearlessness and love of freedom, are traits\ncharacteristic of an age of chivalry; and persons who embody them represent\nsuch a period, it being neither more nor less admirable than that of merchant-\nprince and caravan-chief. The potentialities of one man lead towards\nsainthood, of another to poetry, of a third to science or mechanics. One\ngravitates into leadership, another as naturally becomes disciple. One enjoys\nknowledge, another ignorance.\n\nWere all of us developed to our own utmost we may take it that every place in\nlife would be filled, every part in the world-drama played, but by men and\nwomen of such ripe and determined personality\n\np. 97\n\nthat we could no more confuse one with the other than we could mistake the\nconduct of Helen of Troy for that of Elisabeth of Hungary, or hers for that of\nFaust\'s Gretchen.\n\nWe have to notice, moreover, that in European life only the born idealist is\ndeeply influenced by any of the miscellaneous characters of history and\nliterature. Religion alone amongst us can exercise this compelling power on a\nlarge scale. And this is related to the fact that only religion gives ideals\nthemselves as motives. Circumstances have in many cases offered such a setting\nthat a life has been forced into brilliance and distinction, but the self-born\nintention of the saints could never be wholly fulfilled. Iphigenia could\nhardly have refused her sacrifice. Joan of Arc, on the contrary, must always\nhave felt that the sword of Michael might have been held still more stainless\nand with a greater courage. It is this fact that gives to the ideals of\nreligion their supreme power of individuation. We must remember also that they\ndiffer from others in making a universal appeal. The girl who aimed at\nbecoming Portia would be guilty of vanity: she whose model is the Blessed\nVirgin receives the respect of all. To imitate Socrates would be a miserable\naffectation: to imitate the religious hero is regarded as a common duty.\n\nIt may seem impossible to dower the heroes and heroines of literature with\nthis projective energy of the lives of saints; but in India, as to some extent\nin Iceland, the feat has been accomplished. For India is also one of the saga-\nlands. At every lull in her history we may hear the chanting of her bards, and\nthe joy of her people in the story of their past. The long twilight of the\nNorth is no better adapted to the growth of such a literature than the deep\nand early night of the South. In verandahs and courtyards, with the women\nconcealed\n\np. 98\n\nbehind screens at the back, it has been the Indian fashion for hundreds of\nyears through the winter months to gather at dusk round the seat of the\nWandering Teller, and listen hour after hour to his stirring theme. Surrounded\nby lights and flowers, gay carpets and burning incense, there is in his\nperformance a mixture of reading, song, and story. It is something of opera,\nsermon, and literature all in one.\n\nEver since the commencement of our era the Hindu people have possessed in\ntheir present forms two great poems, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. * The\nfirst of these is their Wars of Troy, their Heimskringla, their Morte\nd\'Arthur. That is to say, it is the book of the Deeds and the Wars of the\nHeroes. Thanks to the long-established culture of the race, and the prestige\nwhich all literature enjoys as "sacred," the Mahabharata is to this day the\nstrongest influence in the shaping of the lives and ambitions of Hindu boys.\n\nThe battle which it describes took place, if at all, very nearly fifteen\nhundred years before the birth of Christ. It lasted many days, and the field\nof combat was called Kurukshetra, being situated on that great plain near\nDelhi where critical moments in the history of India have been so often\ndecided. For many a century after Kurukshetra the wandering bards all over\nIndia sang of the great battle; and when any new theme claimed their creative\npowers, it had to be recounted as if originally told by one of the heroes to\nanother at some particular moment in the course of the main narrative. In this\nway the heart\'s heart of the whole poem, the Bhagavad Gita (a title translated\nby some scholars as "Gospel of the Bhagavats") brings an interesting instance\nof\n\np. 99\n\ndouble drama with it. The Gita consists in itself of a dialogue between a\nyoung Chieftain and Krishna, the Divine Personage who is acting as his\ncharioteer, at the moment of the opening of the eighteen days\' combat. But the\ndevice which enables the conversation to be given in detail is the picture of\nan old blind king, head of one of the rival houses, seated some miles away,\nand attended in his anxiety by a man of what is called _yogic_ , or hyper-\naesthetic, that is, psychic sense, who utters to him every word as it is\nspoken.\n\nThe exquisite story of Savitri, similarly, is told by a _rishi_ , or great\nsage, to Yudisthira, at the close of day, during the banishment of the five\nPandavas to the forest.\n\nOn this plan, more than half the country-side tales of Northern India could be\nwoven into the Mahabharata when it was first thrown into form by some unknown\nhand, three or four centuries before Christ. It underwent its final recension\nnot more than two or three hundred years later--a possible fifteen hundred\nyears after the occurrence of the events which are its central theme. It is\neasy to see that this saga fulfils thus all the conditions of great epic\npoetry. The stories that it tells have been worked over by the imagination of\nsingers and people for hundreds of years. They have become simple, direct,\ninevitable. They are spoken out of the inmost heart of a nation not yet\ndreaming of self-consciousness. They are nothing if not absolutely sincere.\n\nComparing the Mahabharata with the Iliad and Odyssey, we find it less formed,\nless highly-wrought; more amorphous, but also more brilliant and intense. To\nquote a great writer on Indian thought--\'\'Outline is entirely lost in colour."\n\nThese characteristics do not hold good to the sane extent of the second Indian\nepic, the Ramayana\n\np. 100\n\nwhich has a closely-worked motive running throughout. This poem--the tale of\nthe Exile of Sita and Rama--received its present form not long after the\nMahabharata, early in the Buddhist period. It is supposed that under Buddhist\ninfluence the monastic life had come to be so honoured that the flower of the\nnation were drawn to it, rather than to the mingled responsibilities and joys\nof the home. The romantic reaction in ideals which was inevitable gathered\nitself about the ancient theme of a princely couple of the house of Oudh, in\nwhom all that was precious in monasticism was found blended with all that was\ndesirable in sovereignty and love. The strong and quiet story spoke straight\nto the heart of the people, and to this day there are no characters so beloved\nby the masses as those of the Ramayana, no one force that goes so far towards\nthe moulding of Indian womanhood, as the ever-living touch of the little hand\nof that Sita who is held to have been Queen of Ayodhya thousands of years ago.\n\nThe Ramayana, then, is a love-story which grew up and carne to its flowering\nin the beginning of the Christian era. But it is unlike all other romances of\nthat early epoch in the subtlety and distinctiveness of its various\ncharacters, and in the complexity of its interpretation of life. For though\nhumanity itself may differ little from age to age, we have been accustomed to\nlook for a definite growth in its literary self-reflection. We expect\nprimitive poetry to be preoccupied with events, portraying men and women only\nin bold outline, as they move with simple grandeur through their fate. We do\nnot look to it for subtle analysis of motive, or any exact mingling of the\nsweet and bitter cup of the personal life. The progress of literature up to\nthis time has been largely, as we think, the intensifying recognition of human\nvariation within a given psychological area. And in making such a statement we\ntake\n\np. 101\n\npains to eliminate from the word "progress" all sense of improvement, since\nHomer remains for ever superior to Browning. Simply, we find in art a parallel\nto the physical process by which the race moves on from strong family and\ncommunal types to a universal individual divergence. An overwhelming\nappreciation of spiritual content is what we have been ready in Europe to call\n"the modern spirit." It is a question whether the name can stand, however,\nwhen the Indian Epics become better known; for, strangely enough, in spite of\ntheir age and the heroic nature of their matter, they are permeated with this\nvery quality. In the Ramayana especially, as incident leads to incident, we\nhave to realise that this is no story told for our amusement, but a woman\'s\nsoul laid bare before us, as she climbs from steep to steep of renunciation.\n\nPerhaps only those who are in touch with national aspiration can fully\nunderstand the roundness and plasticity of its drama, but even the most\ncursory reader must be struck with this insight and delicacy of the Ramayana.\n\nIt is more to-day than a completed work of art; it is still a means for the\ndevelopment of the popular imagination. Even amongst the written versions we\nfind no two quite alike. All children are brought up on the story, yet those\nwho can read the original Sanskrit are few in number. To meet this fact\ntranslations have been made into various vernaculars by great poets from time\nto time--into Bengali, for instance, by Kritibas, and into Hindi by Tulsidas.\nSpecial incidents again have been selected and worked up into great episodes\nin Sanskrit, by one and another, such as Bhavabhuti in his "Exile of Sita," or\nDatta in the "Epic of Ravana."\n\nIn these versions the story becomes more and more clearly defined. Pulsing\nthrough every Ramayana runs the Hindu reverence for Rama as man,\n\np. 102\n\nhusband, and king. This reverence may seek new modes of expression, but it can\nnever admit that that which is expressed was at any time less than the ideal.\nYet we must remember that that ideal is, in the ancient terms, Oriental rather\nthan Occidental. It belonged to a conception of duty that placed Society far\nabove the individual, and made the perfect king seek the good of his people\nwithout any consideration for his own or his wife\'s happiness. The fact that\nmade his marriage perfect was its complete demonstration that it was as\npossible for two as for one to devote themselves first to the general weal.\nFor the acquiescence of Sita is given in her twenty years of silent\nbanishment. Once during that time, says one of the regional poets, she saw her\nhusband as he passed through the forest where she was and kept silence still.\nAnd though the incident is an addition not found in the original, it only\nserves to bring out more clearly the intention of the first poem, where every\ndumb moment of those twenty years speaks louder than words the wife\'s\nacquiescence in her husband\'s will.\n\nBehind the vernacular translators stand all those old nurses and granddams on\nwhose laps the poets themselves first heard the great tale; and it is their\nperfect freedom to give their own versions of each episode--as must any of us\nin recounting actual happenings--that keeps it fresh and living and explains\nits changes of tint in the hands of genius.\n\nWithout the recognition of this working of the communal consciousness on the\ntheme, there can he no complete criticism of the Ramayana, for of this are all\nnew transcribings of the story born. It is more or less in this fashion that\nthe old tale is told:\n\nLong ago, in the age of the heroes, there dwelt kings in Oudh, of whose race\ncame one Rama, heir\n\np. 103\n\nto the throne, great of heart, and goodly to look upon. And Rama was wedded to\nSita, daughter of Janaka the king, fairest and purest of all the children of\nmen. Now Rama had been trained in all knowledge and in the sports of princes,\nliving, as was the manner of those days, in the forest, with his brother\nLakshman, in the care of a great sage. And it happened, after he was come home\nagain and wedded with Sita, that there arose a trouble between the king his\nfather, and one of the younger queens, Kaikeyi, who desired that her son\nBharata should inherit the throne, and pleaded that her husband had once\npromised her whatever gift she should desire. And when one told Rama of this\ncontention that was embittering his father\'s age, he replied at once by a vow\nto renounce the throne and retire to the forest for fourteen years. And\ngladly, he said, was this vow made, since it would give pleasure to Kaikeyi,\nhis stepmother, and confer on Bharata, his younger brother, the kingdom and\nits wealth. And Sita, overhearing the vow, added hers to his, in spite of his\nentreaties that she should not quit her royal state. Lakshman also declared\nthat he would not be separated from his elder brother. So all three fared\nforth together into the great forest. Thither, shortly after, followed\nBharata, saying that the king their father was now dead of grief at the wrong\ndone his eldest son, and imploring Rama to return and take his own place in\nhis kingdom, for Bharata had mingled no whit in the scheming of Kaikeyi. But\nRama refused till the days of his vow should be ended; after fourteen years,\nhe said, he would return and reign. Then, very reluctantly, went Bharata back\nto Oudh, but he carried with him the sandals of Rama, declaring that these\nshould hold the throne, and he himself sit always below them, governing in\ntheir name.\n\nLeft in the forest, the life of Sita, Rama, and\n\np. 104\n\n[paragraph continues] Lakshman, became that of gentle anchorites, and they\ngrew great in all manner of woodcraft, so that the wild creatures answered to\ntheir call. But Rama and Lakshman never ceased to remember their knighthood,\nholding themselves ready with sword and bow for the service of all who were in\ndistress. It was on one of their expeditions of knight-errantry that they\noffended a great ogress, and brought on themselves the enmity of her powerful\nkinsman, Ravana the Ten-headed, king of the island of Lanka or Ceylon.\n\nIt was inevitable that some of the skalds who chanted the deeds of Rama should\nattach themselves specially to the character of this mythical Ravana,\nelaborating all connected with him. Hence, just as Hector and Andromache are\namongst the most beautiful figures in the Iliad, so, in the Indian poem, is\nMandodari, the wife of Ravana, one of the strongest personages, at least from\na literary point of view. To this day old wives tell of an incident that has\ncrept into no published poem. When the time came, they say, that Rama had\nconquered and slain his ten-headed foe, Mandodari was inconsolable that she\nwas now a widow. Then it was declared to her that, till her husband\'s funeral\nfire was dead she should be no widow, and that that fire should burn for ever.\nAnd so, sure enough, we have only to shut our ears tight, and we hear the\nroaring of the flames that are burning Ravana to ashes\n\nFor so it was, that Rama had to defeat and slay this evil king in order to\nrecover Sita, who had been stolen from him. The story of the Taking of Sita is\nas beautiful as Pluto\'s Capture of Proserpine.\n\nIt is the close of day in the forest, and Sita is alone. Lakshman--one of the\nmost "perfect gentle knights" in the whole range of fiction--has left her, at\nher earnest entreaty that he should go to seek for\n\np. 105\n\n[paragraph continues] Rama, but he has first drawn three circles about her\nwith the end of his bow, and warned her not to step outside. The sun is not\nyet set, however, when a Brahmin appears, ashen-clad, with matted locks, and\nbegs for charity. Sita pleads that it is late and she is alone, imploring him\nto go. And this he promises to do if only first she will step outside and give\nhim a little food. She is full of dim forebodings of evil, but pity at last\ngains the upper hand of fear; she steps out of her enchanted circles to bestow\nalms on him; he throws off the disguise of the Brahmin, appears as Ravana\nhimself, and carries her off to his kingdom in his chariot. It is during the\nfirst terrible moment of the journey that Sita drops her jewels stealthily\nbehind her, in order that those coming after may be able to trace her flight.\n\nSurely this picture of the exiled queen, standing amidst the long shadows in\nher simple hut, lost in the struggle between her desire to aid and all the\ninvisible safeguards of her womanhood, is one that deserves the brush of some\ngreat painter.\n\nFor years Sita is kept confined in Lanka, and Rama and Lakshman, in their\nprogress through what is depicted as the wilderness of Southern India, owe her\ndiscovery and much of their success in finally releasing her, to the services\nof their great ally, Hanuman, the monkey-general. It is supposed that if there\nbe any historical foundation for the legend of the Ramayana, this name of\nHanuman may refer to the chieftain of some strong aboriginal tribe. In any\ncase, he stands to-day for all that is great in discipleship. Filled with the\nworship of Rama, he brings to his service the unquestioning obedience of a\nchild and the genius of a man. It is in his presence and that of Lakshman that\nSita goes proudly, at her own request, through that ordeal by fire which is to\nprove her stainlessness, and he\n\np. 106\n\ndeclares that at death the names of Sita and Rama will be found written on his\nheart.\n\nIt is now time for the return to the kingdom, and Sita and Rama go back to\nOudh, reigning there in perfect happiness close upon a year. Then comes the\ngreat crisis of their parting, in deference to the people\'s doubt of Sita. She\nretires to a distant forest, to live the life of a nun, under the care of\nValmiki, the old hermit; and Rama sits alone on the throne of Oudh for the\nrest of his life. Once only does he speak of his loss. His subjects desire him\nto take a new queen, for the performance of a state sacrifice that he cannot\nmake alone. But here the wrath of the king blazes forth. No woman shall ever\nbe put in Sita\'s place, but a golden image of her is made, and fills her part\nin the appointed ceremonies.\n\nShortly after her arrival in the forest, Sita had become the mother of twin\nsons, and Valmiki, their foster-father, brings these up as princes, only\ntaking care to add to their education the knowledge of his own great poem, the\nRamayana. He allows it to be supposed, also, that their mother is dead. When\nthe boys are some twenty years of age, news goes about the country of a great\nreligious festival to be held at the Court of Ayodhya, and the hermit makes\nready to go up to it, taking his two foster-sons in the character of\nminstrels, and the queen.\n\nThe rest of the story is inevitable. The eyes of Rama discover his boys as\nthey recite before him the deeds of his own past, and calling Valmiki to him,\nhe speaks with hopeless longing the name of Sita. The old man draws her\nforward, and she unveils her face to her husband. At this moment, as the two\nlook, each upon the face that has been present to every thought for twenty\nyears, the murmur of the people\'s doubt is once more heard,\n\np. 107\n\nand the cry rises from the crowd, "Let her be tried by fire!"\n\nNo woman\'s pride could brook this renewed insult. Sita, the proud, the silent,\nthe stainless, cries out for death. At her words, the ground opens, a chariot\nappears, and in the arms of her Mother Earth she is withdrawn from the world\nof men. Rama waits only to bestow the kingdom on his sons, and then plunges\ninto the forest, to be for ever lost to humanity.\n\n\n\nThe story of the Mahabharata would be less easy to recount. Mighty warriors,\nbeautiful women, and great saints move to and fro across its scenes in a\nglittering _mel ee_. The local colour is rich to a fault. The poem abounds in\ndescriptions of social customs, domestic comfort, the fashions of old armour\nand similar details. But it is in the conception of character which it reveals\nthat it becomes most significant. Bhishma, the Indian Arthur, is there, with\nhis perfect knighthood and awful purity of soul. Lancelot is there--a\nglorified Lancelot, whose only fall was the utterance of a half-truth once,\nwith purpose to mislead--in the person of the young king, Yudisthira. And\nKrishna, the Indian Christ, is there, in that guise of prince and leader of\nmen that has given him the name in India of "The Perfect Incarnation." One of\nthe rival houses consists of a family of no less than a hundred children, so\nthat the multiplicity of persons and incidents is best left to the\nimagination. Yet certain main features belong to the treatment of all\ncharacters alike. For the attention of the poet-chronicler is fixed on the\ninvisible shackles of selfhood that bind us all. He seems to be describing\ngreat events; in reality he does not for one instant forget that he is\noccupied with the history of souls, depicting the incidence of their\nexperience and knowledge on the external world.\n\np. 108\n\nOne story is typical. The young princes are taking a lesson in shooting, and a\nclay bird has been set up as target. One by one they are asked by their master\nwhat they see. They reply, "A bird," "A branch supporting a bird," and so on.\nTill at last he puts the question to Arjuna, one of the youngest, and receives\nthe answer, "A bird\'s head, and in that head only the eye." The moment of the\ntelling of this story to an Indian child is tense with feeling. For it\nembodies the culminating ideal of the nation, inasmuch as "Concentration of\nMind" stands among Hindus for the supreme expression of that greatness which\nwe may recognise in honour or courage or any kind of heroism.\n\nThe central character of the Mahabharata fulfil a very subtle demand. Bhishma\nis intended for the type of king and knight. Now, knighthood implies the\nstriking of many blows, and kinghood the protecting of manifold and diverse\ninterests, but perfection requires that nothing shall be done from the motive\nof self-interest. In order, therefore, that he may display all the greatness\nof character that is possible to man in these relations, Bhishma is made, as\nheir to the throne, to renounce all rights of succession and even of marriage,\nat the beginning of his life, by way of setting his father free to marry a\nfisher-girl whom he loves, and make her son his heir.\n\nFrom this point, having set aside the privileges of parent and sovereign,\nBhishma is made to bear to the full the responsibilities of both; and finally,\nin the energy and faithfulness of his military service, life itself can only\nbe taken from him when he with his own lips has given instructions for his\ndefeat. In Bhishma, therefore, we have the creation of a people who have\nalready learnt to regard detachment as a necessary element of moral grandeur.\n\nIt is strange to us, but perfectly consistent with\n\np. 109\n\nthis point of view, that as long as Bhisma remains a militant figure in the\nbattle of Kurukshetra he is acting as generalissimo for what he regards as the\nworse cause of the two. He has done his best to prevent the war, but when it\nis determined on, he sets himself to obey his sovereign, in the place that is\nhis own. He is filled, as the Indian poet represents him, with supernatural\nassurance that his side must lose, yet he strikes not a single blow either\nmore or less for this consideration. In like manner it is told of Krishna that\nafter he has done his utmost for peace in the interests of justice, he is\napproached by both parties for his aid, and that such is the calmness of his\noutlook on life that he submits the matter to a moral test. To one claimant he\nwill give his armies; the other he will serve in person unarmed, he says,\nleaving the choice to themselves. It is clear that the man whose greed and\nambition are plunging whole nations into war will not have the spiritual\ninsight to choose the Divine Person for his champion, rather than great hosts.\nAnd he does not.\n\nSuch stories illustrate the Hindu endeavour to understand every man\'s relation\nto a given situation, and to read in conflicting lines of conduct that same\nirresistible necessity which, acting from within, hurls each one of us upon\nhis fate. In this endeavour lies the real secret of that tolerance which has\nso puzzled observers in the Indian people. Not only has there never been\nreligious persecution among Hindus, but the sceptic, the atheist, or the\nChristian missionary is as free to preach on the steps of the temple as the\nbelieving priest. The European correlative of the trait is found in the\ndramatist or novelist of genius who can represent the motives of opposing\nsides so as to draw equally upon our sympathy; but this has always been an\nexceptional ability with us, and not a common attitude of mind.\n\np. 110\n\nIn the Mahabharata itself the most perfect expression of such reconciliation\nof opposites is perhaps found in the story of Shishupal, the enemy of Krishna.\nShishupal\'s mother had won Krishna\'s promise that her son might sin against\nhim a hundred times, and yet be forgiven. But this cup of error was already\nfull, when his crowning blasphemy occurred. The occasion was that of the\noffering of certain honours to the Chief of Knights. Krishna, in right of his\ndivinity, had already been named, and the decision that to him should the\nsacrifice be made was spoken. To the deep-rooted hostility of Shishupal,\nhowever, this was unendurable. He broke out into indignant protest. In what\nsense, he asked, was Krishna greatest of the knights? Was not Bhishma present?\nWas not Yudisthira their liege? Let the honours be paid to one of these.\n\nShocked and outraged, every one looked to Bhishma to punish the impiety; but\nthat aged clansman\'s face was turned towards the Avatar. Then, as all waited\nin suspense, from behind the Blessed Knight flashed forth the bright discus of\nVishnu, and striking the helmet of Shishupal clove him through, even to the\nground. And lo, before their eyes, the soul of that sinful one came forth like\na mass of flame, and passed over and melted into the feet of Krishna. "For\neven the enemies of God go to salvation," says the old chronicler, "by\nthinking much upon Him." A later increment of explanation makes the point\nstill clearer. It had happened in some previous age that a great and\nenlightened spirit had fallen under a curse--had strayed, that is to say, into\nthose circles of destiny that would involve hint in human birth. And the All-\nMerciful, being touched with pity, offered him the path of return through\nseven births as the friend of God, or three as His enemy. The second\nalternative was his instant choice, and he became in one life Ravana\n\np. 111\n\nthe foe of Rama; in another, a certain persecuting king; and in the third,\nthis Shishupal, now once more absorbed into Eternal Bliss.\n\nFew characters in literature can rank with the heroic figure of young Karna.\nDark with anger, but perfect in chivalry, he resents to the death a slight\nlevelled at his birth, yet turns in the midst of princely acclaims to salute\nreverently the aged charioteer supposed to be his father. Full of a\npalpitating humanity is Draupadi, the Pandava Queen. Beautiful and high-\nspirited as she is, she has all a woman\'s inability to keep a secret, and her\nfoolish boastfulness almost betrays the heroes before their time is ripe. The\nstrongest attraction of such figures is always the actuality. There is nothing\nincredibly exalted about them, but good and evil are entwined in their\nnatures, strong and heroic though they be, as in us all.\n\nThe end of Bhishma is like that of some ancient Norseman. Lying on the field\nof battle where he fell, he refuses to be moved, and asks only for a bed and\npillow such as are fit for knightly bowmen. One of the young chiefs divines\nhis meaning, and, stepping forward, shoots arrows into the earth till what was\ndesired has been provided. And on his bed of arrows Bhishma dies.\n\n\n\nSuch are some of the characters who form the ideal world of the Hindu home.\nAbsorbed in her "worship of the Feet of the Lord," the little girl sits for\nhours in her corner, praying, "Make me a wife like Sita! Give me a husband\nlike Rama!" Each act or speech of the untrained boy rushing in from school,\nmay remind some one, half-laughing, half-admiring, of Yudisthira or Lakshman,\nof Karna or Arjuna, and the name is sure to be recalled. It is expected that\neach member of the family shall have his favourite hero, who will be to him a\nsort of\n\np. 112\n\npatron saint, and may appear as the centre of the story, if he is bidden to\nrecount it. Thus, when one tells the Ramayana, Ravana is the hero; another\nmakes it Hanuman; only the books keep it always Sita and Rama. And it is well\nunderstood that the chosen ideal exercises a preponderant influence over one\'s\nown development. None could love Lakshman without growing more full of gentle\ncourtesy and tender consideration for the needs of others; he who cares for\nHartman cannot fail to become more capable of supreme devotion and ready\nservice. And justice itself must reign in the heart that adores Yudisthira.\n\nThe character of Bhishma in the Mahabharata as that of Sita in the Ramayana is\na proof that Indian philosophy was completed before the Epics. But that\nphilosophy itself, we must remember, was directly related to the common life\nof common folk. Only this fact can explain the recognition and welcome of such\nconceptions by the whole nation. Let us look at the love story of Sita. Her\nfeeling is consecrated by the long years of poverty filled with worship, in\nthe forest. When it is thus established, she undergoes the dreary persecution\nand imprisonment at the hands of Ravana. Every moment finds her repeating the\nname of Rama, her faith unshaken in her ultimate rescue. At the end she\nherself suggests the fiery ordeal, and goes through it with dauntless courage.\n\nThen for one short year, as wife, and queen, and future mother, she tastes of\nentire earthly happiness, only to be swept away from her home again in the\nsternness of her husband\'s will for his people\'s good. Through twenty years of\nacquiescent silence she keeps now, in all its fulness, that love that sent her\nfirst to share Rama\'s exile in the forest, and yet the perfection of her pride\nof womanhood is shown\n\np. 113\n\nwhen she dies of the insult conveyed in a spoken doubt.\n\nWe believe vaguely that the power to renounce distinguishes the human from all\nlife known to us; but a conception of renunciation so searching, so austere as\nthis appals us. It is clear that a commanding philosophy of self-discipline\nlay behind, or the poet\'s hand could not have been so remorseless; but it is\nalso clear that that philosophy was living in the heart and effort of the\npeople, or Sita and Rama could not have been so loved.\n\nWe ask in vain what can have been the life of India before she found refuge\nand direction in such dreams as these. For to-day it has become so one with\nthem that all trace of the dawn before they were is lost. They penetrate to\nevery part of the country, every class of society, every grade of education.\nJourneying in the mountains at nightfall, one came upon the small open hut of\nthe grain-dealer, and saw, round a tiny lamp, a boy reading the Ramayana in\nthe vernacular to a circle of his elders. At the end of each stanza they bowed\ntheir heads to the earth, with the chant, "To dear Sita\'s bridegroom, great\nRama, all hail!" The shopkeeper in the city counts out his wares to the\ncustomer, saying, "One (Ram), two (Ram), three (Ram)," and so on, relapsing\ninto a dream of worship when the measuring is done. Nay, once at least it is\ntold how at the "Four (Ram)" the blessed name was enough to touch the inmost\nsoul of him who uttered it, and he rose up then and there and left the world\nbehind him. The woman terrified at thunder calls on "Sita Ram!" and the\nbearers of the dead keep time to the cry of "Rama Nama Sattva hai!" ("The name\nof the Lord alone is real!")\n\nWhat philosophy by itself could never have done for the humble, what the laws\nof Manu have done only in some small measure for the few, that the Epics\n\np. 114\n\nhave done through unnumbered ages and are doing still for all classes alike.\nThey are the perpetual Hinduisers, for they are the ideal embodiments of that\nform of life, that conception of conduct, of which laws and theories can give\nbut the briefest abstract, yet towards which the hope and effort of every\nHindu child must be directed.\n\nWe are in the habit of talking of the changeless East; and, though there is a\ncertain truth in tht phrase, there is also a large element of fallacy. One of\nthe most striking features of Hindu society during the past fifty years has\nbeen the readiness of the people to adopt a foreign form of culture and to\ncompete with those who are native to that culture on equal terms. In medicine,\nin letters, in science, even in industry, where there has been opportunity, we\nare astonished at the intellectual adaptability of the race. Is the mere\nbeckoning of the finger of the nineteenth century enough to subvert\npredilections as old as Babylon and Nineveh? we ask, amazed. By no means. much\nchanges as these are merely surface deep. The hauteur of the East lies in the\nvery knowledge that its civilisation has nothing to fear from the social and\nintellectual experiments of its youngsters, or even from such complete changes\nof mental raiment as amongst newer peoples would constitute revolutions of\nthought, for the effort of Eastern civilisation has always been to the\nsolitary end of moralising the individual, and in this way it differs\nessentially from Western systems of culture, which have striven rather for the\nmost efficient use of materials. If Alexander, capable of organising the\nlargest number of his fellows most effectually for a combination of military,\ncommercial, and scientific ends in that most difficult form, an armed\nexpedition over hostile territory--if Alexander be taken as the type of\nOccidental genius, then, as the culminating example of the Oriental, we must\nname Buddha;\n\np. 115\n\nfor clear and intense conceptions of perfect renunciation and inner\nillumination are the hidden springs of Hindu living, around which the home\nitself is built. These it is of which the Epics are the popular vehicles,\nthese it is which give its persistence to Indian civilisation through the\ncenturies, and this is why no examination syllabus, no alien\'s kindly\ninspiration, no foreigner\'s appreciation or contempt, can ever hope to have\none iota of permanent influence on the national education at its core.\n\nReforming sects are very apt to reject what is much cultivated amongst the\northodox--the folk-lore that has grown up round the Epics in the Puranas and\nother literature. But to the poems themselves all cling fast. None fail to\nrealise that they bear the mark of supreme literature, and so they remain a\nconstant element, capable, like all great interpretations of life, of\ninfinitely varied application, a treasure greater, because more greatly used,\nthan any Anger of Achilles, or Descent into Purgatory, amongst them all.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[98:*](wil09.htm#fr_9) The theory of the dates of the Mahabharata and Ramayana\nput forward in this chapter is that of Mr. Romesh Chunder Dutt.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII.
