And on account of the topic of the whole section.\n\nMoreover the highest Brahman constitutes the topic of the entire section. Cp.\n'The wise who knows the Self as great and omnipresent does not grieve' (Ka.\nUp. I, 2, 22); 'That Self cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by understanding,\nnor by much learning. He whom the Self chooses, by him the Self can be gained;\nthe Self chooses him as his own' (I, 2, 23).--Moreover, the clause (forming\npart of the text under discussion),'Who knows him (i.e. the being which\nconstitutes the topic of the section) where he is?' clearly shows that we have\nto recognise here the Self of which it had previously been said that it is\nhard to know unless it assists us with its grace.\n\nTo this conclusion a new objection presents itself.--Further on in the same\nUpanishad (I, 3, 1) we meet with the following text: 'There are two, drinking\ntheir reward in the world of their own works, entered into the cave, dwelling\non the highest summit; those who know Brahman call them shade and light,\nlikewise those householders who perform the Tri _nak_ iketa-sacrifice.' Now\nthis text clearly refers to the individual soul which enjoys the reward of its\nworks, together with an associate coupled to it. And this associate is either\nthe vital breath, or the organ of knowledge (buddhi). For the drinking of '\n_ri_ ta' is the enjoyment of the fruit of works, and such enjoyment does not\nsuit the highest Self. The buddhi, or the vital breath, on the other hand,\nwhich are instruments of the enjoying embodied soul, may somehow be brought\ninto connexion with the enjoyment of the fruit of works. As the text is thus\nseen to refer to the embodied soul coupled with some associate, we infer, on\nthe ground of the two texts belonging to one section, that also the 'eater'\ndescribed in the\n\np. 268\n\nformer text is none other than the individual soul.--To this objection the\nnext Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 11.
