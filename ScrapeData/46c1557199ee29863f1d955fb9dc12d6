Next follow the powers of that Person 1.\n\n2\\. By his speech earth and fire were created.\n\np. 211\n\n[paragraph continues] Herbs are produced on the earth, and Agni (fire) makes\nthem ripe and sweet. 'Take this, take this,' thus saying do earth and fire\nserve their parent, speech.\n\n3\\. As far as the earth reaches, as far as fire reaches, so far does his world\nextend, and as long as the world of the earth and fire does not decay, so long\ndoes his world not decay who thus knows this power of speech.\n\n4\\. By breath (in the nose) the sky and the air were created. People follow\nthe sky, and hear along the sky, while the air carries along pure scent. Thus\ndo sky and air serve their parent, the breath.\n\nAs far as the sky reaches, as far as the air reaches, so far does his world\nextend, and as long as the world of the sky and the air does not decay, so\nlong does his world not decay who thus knows this power of breath.\n\n5\\. By his eye heaven and the sun were created. Heaven gives him rain and\nfood, while the sun causes his light to shine. Thus do the heaven and the sun\nserve their parent, the eye.\n\nAs far as heaven reaches and as far as the sun reaches, so far does his world\nextend, and as long as the world of heaven and the sun does not decay, so long\ndoes his world not decay who thus knows the power of the eye.\n\n6\\. By his ear the quarters and the moon were created. From all the quarters\nthey come to him, and from all the quarters he hears, while the moon produces\nfor him the bright and the dark halves for the sake of sacrificial work. Thus\ndo the quarters and the moon serve their parent, the ear.\n\nAs far as the quarters reach and as far as the\n\np. 212\n\nmoon reaches, so far does his world extend, and as long as the world of the\nquarters and the moon does not decay, so long does his world not decay who\nthus knows the power of the ear.\n\n7\\. By his mind the water and Varu _n_ a were created. Water yields to him\nfaith (being used for sacred acts), Varu _n_ a keeps his offspring within the\nlaw. Thus do water and Varu _n_ a serve their parent, the mind.\n\nAs far as water reaches and as far as Varu _n_ a reaches, so far does his\nworld extend, and as long as the world of water and Varu _n_ a does not decay,\nso long does his world not decay who thus knows the power of the mind.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[210:1](sbe01208.htm#fr_523) The purusha, as described before in the second\nchapter, is the Pra _g_ apati or universal spirit with whom the worshipper is\nto identify himself by meditation. The manifestations of his power consist in\ncreating the earth, fire, the sky, the air, heaven, the sun.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 8](sbe01209.htm)\n\n"
