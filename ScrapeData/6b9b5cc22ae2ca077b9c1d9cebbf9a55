In the scriptural account of creation\npreceded by intention on the part of the Creator it is said that each of these\nelements was made tripartite; and this tripartite constitution of all things\nis apprehended by Perception as well. The red colour in burning fire comes\nfrom (primal elementary) fire, the white colour from water, the black colour\nfrom earth--in this way Scripture explains the threefold nature of burning\nfire. In the same way all things are composed of elements of all things. The\nVish _n_ u Pura _n_ a, in its account of creation, makes a similar statement:\n"The elements possessing various powers and being unconnected could not,\nwithout combination, produce living beings, not having mingled in any way.\nHaving combined, therefore, with one another, and entering into mutual\nassociations--beginning with the principle called Mahat, and extending down to\nthe gross elements--they formed an egg," &c. (Vi. Pu. I, 2, 50; 52). This\ntripartiteness of the elements the Sutrakara also declares\n\np. 120\n\n[paragraph continues] (Ve. Su. III, 1, 3). For the same reason _S_ ruti\nenjoins the use of Putika sprouts when no Soma can be procured; for, as the\nMima _m_ sakas explain, there are in the Putika plant some parts of the Soma\nplant (Pu. Mi. Su.); and for the same reason nivara grains may be used as a\nsubstitute for rice grains. That thing is similar to another which contains\nwithin itself some part of that other thing; and Scripture itself has thus\nstated that in shells, &c., there is contained some silver, and so on. That\none thing is called "silver" and another "shell" has its reason in the\nrelative preponderance of one or the other element. We observe that shells are\nsimilar to silver; thus perception itself informs us that some elements of the\nlatter actually exist in the former. Sometimes it happens that owing to a\ndefect of the eye the silver-element only is apprehended, not the shell-\nelement, and then the percipient person, desirous of silver, moves to pick up\nthe shell. If, on the other hand, his eye is free from such defect, he\napprehends the shell-element and then refrains from action. Hence the\ncognition of silver in the shell is a true one. In the same way the relation\nof one cognition being sublated by another explains itself through the\npreponderant element, according as the preponderance of the shell-element is\napprehended partially or in its totality, and does not therefore depend on one\ncognition having for its object the false thing and another the true thing.\nThe distinctions made in the practical thought and business of life thus\nexplain themselves on the basis of everything participating in the nature of\neverything else.\'\n\nIn dreams, again, the divinity creates, in accordance with the merit or\ndemerit of living beings, things of a special nature, subsisting for a certain\ntime only, and perceived only by the individual soul for which they are meant.\nIn agreement herewith Scripture says, with reference to the state of dreaming,\n\'There are no chariots in that state, no horses, no roads; then he creates\nchariots, horses, and roads. There are no delights, no joys, no bliss; then he\ncreates delights, joys, and bliss. There are no tanks, no lakes, no rivers;\nthen he creates tanks, lakes, and rivers.\n\np. 121\n\n[paragraph continues] For he is the maker\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 10). The\nmeaning of this is, that although there are then no chariots, &c., to be\nperceived by other persons, the Lord creates such things to be perceived by\nthe dreaming person only. \'For he is the maker\'; for such creative agency\nbelongs to him who possesses the wonderful power of making all his wishes and\nplans to come true. Similarly another passage, \'That person who is awake in\nthose who are asleep, shaping one lovely sight after another, that indeed is\nthe Bright, that is Brahman, that alone is called the Immortal. All worlds are\ncontained in it, and no one goes beyond it\' (Ka. Up. II, 5, 8).--The Sutrakara\nalso, after having in two Sutras (III, 2, 1; 2) stated the hypothesis of the\nindividual soul creating the objects appearing in dreams, finally decides that\nthat wonderful creation is produced by the Lord for the benefit of the\nindividual dreamer; for the reason that as long as the individual soul is in\nthe sa _m_ sara state, its true nature--comprising the power of making its\nwishes to come true--is not fully manifested, and hence it cannot practically\nexercise that power. The last clause of the Ka _th_ a text (\'all worlds are\ncontained in it,\' &c.) clearly shows that the highest Self only is the creator\nmeant. That the dreaming person who lies in his chamber should go in his body\nto other countries and experience various results of his merit or demerit--\nbeing at one time crowned a king, having at another time his head cut off, and\nso on--is possible in so far as there is created for him another body in every\nway resembling the body resting on the bed.\n\nThe case of the white shell being seen as yellow, explains itself as follows.\nThe visual rays issuing from the eye are in contact with the bile contained in\nthe eye, and thereupon enter into conjunction with the shell; the result is\nthat the whiteness belonging to the shell is overpowered by the yellowness of\nthe bile, and hence not apprehended; the shell thus appears yellow, just as if\nit were gilt. The bile and its yellowness is, owing to its exceeding tenuity,\nnot perceived by the bystanders; but thin though it be it is apprehended by\nthe person suffering from jaundice,\n\np. 122\n\nto whom it is very near, in so far as it issues from his own eye, and through\nthe mediation of the visual rays, aided by the action of the impression\nproduced on the mind by that apprehension, it is apprehended even in the\ndistant object, viz. the shell.--In an analogous way the crystal which is\nplaced near the rose is apprehended as red, for it is overpowered by the\nbrilliant colour of the rose; the brilliancy of the rose is perceived in a\nmore distinct way owing to its close conjunction with the transparent\nsubstance of the crystal.--In the same way the cognition of water in the\nmirage is true. There always exists water in connexion with light and earth;\nbut owing to some defect of the eye of the perceiving person, and to the\nmysterious influence of merit and demerit, the light and the earth are not\napprehended, while the water _is_ apprehended.--In the case again of the\nfirebrand swung round rapidly, its appearance as a fiery wheel explains itself\nthrough the circumstance that moving very rapidly it is in conjunction with\nall points of the circle described without our being able to apprehend the\nintervals. The case is analogous to that of the perception of a real wheel;\nbut there is the difference that in the case of the wheel no intervals are\napprehended, because there are none; while in the case of the firebrand none\nare apprehended owing to the rapidity of the movement. But in the latter case\nalso the cognition is true.--Again, in the case of mirrors and similar\nreflecting surfaces the perception of one\'s own face is likewise true. The\nfact is that the motion of the visual rays (proceeding from the eye towards\nthe mirror) is reversed (reflected) by the mirror, and that thus those rays\napprehend the person\'s own face, subsequently to the apprehension of the\nsurface of the mirror; and as in this case also, owing to the rapidity of the\nprocess, there is no apprehension of any interval (between the mirror and the\nface), the face presents itself as being in the mirror.--In the case of one\ndirection being mistaken for another (as when a person thinks the south to be\nwhere the north is), the fact is that, owing to the unseen principle (i.e.\nmerit or demerit), the direction which actually exists in the other direction\n(for a point\n\np. 123\n\nwhich is to the north of me is to the south of another point) is apprehended\nby itself, apart from the other elements of direction; the apprehension which\nactually takes place is thus likewise true. Similar is the case of the double\nmoon. Here, either through pressure of the finger upon the eye, or owing to\nsome abnormal affection of the eye, the visual rays are divided (split), and\nthe double, mutually independent apparatus of vision thus originating, becomes\nthe cause of a double apprehension of the moon. One apparatus apprehends the\nmoon in her proper place; the other which moves somewhat obliquely, apprehends\nat first a place close by the moon, and then the moon herself, which thus\nappears somewhat removed from her proper place. Although, therefore, what is\napprehended is the one moon distinguished by connection with two places at the\nsame time--an apprehension due to the double apparatus of vision--yet, owing\nto the difference of apprehensions, there is a difference in the character of\nthe object apprehended, and an absence of the apprehension of unity, and thus\na double moon presents itself to perception. That the second spot is viewed as\nqualifying the moon, is due to the circumstance that the apprehension of that\nspot, and that of the moon which is not apprehended in her proper place, are\nsimultaneous. Now here the doubleness of the apparatus is real, and hence the\napprehension of the moon distinguished by connexion with two places is real\nalso, and owing to this doubleness of apprehension, the doubleness of aspect\nof the object apprehended,i.e. the moon, is likewise real. That there is only\none moon constituting the true object of the double apprehension, this is a\nmatter for which ocular perception by itself does not suffice, and hence what\nis actually seen is a double moon. That, although the two eyes together\nconstitute one visual apparatus only, the visual rays being divided through\nsome defect of the eyes, give rise to a double apparatus--this we infer from\nthe effect actually observed. When that defect is removed there takes place\nonly one apprehension of the moon as connected with her proper place, and thus\nthe idea of one moon only arises. It is at the same time\n\np. 124\n\nquite clear how the defect of the eye gives rise to a double visual apparatus,\nthe latter to a double apprehension, and the latter again to a doubleness of\nthe object of apprehension.\n\nWe have thus proved that all cognition is true. The shortcomings of other\nviews as to the nature of cognition have been set forth at length by other\nphilosophers, and we therefore do not enter on that topic. What need is there,\nin fact, of lengthy proofs? Those who acknowledge the validity of the\ndifferent means of knowledge, perception, and so on, and--what is vouched for\nby sacred tradition--the existence of a highest Brahman--free from all shadow\nof imperfection, of measureless excellence, comprising within itself\nnumberless auspicious qualities, all-knowing, immediately realising all its\npurposes--, what should they not be able to prove? That holy highest Brahman--\nwhile producing the entire world as an object of fruition for the individual\nsouls, in agreement with their respective good and ill deserts--creates\ncertain things of such a nature as to become common objects of consciousness,\neither pleasant or unpleasant, to all souls together, while certain other\nthings are created in such a way as to be perceived only by particular\npersons, and to persist for a limited time only. And it is this distinction--\nviz. of things that are objects of general consciousness, and of things that\nare not so--which makes the difference between what is called \'things\nsublating\' and \'things sublated.\'--Everything is explained hereby.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Neither Scripture nor Smriti and Purana teach Nescience](sbe48030.htm)\n\n'
