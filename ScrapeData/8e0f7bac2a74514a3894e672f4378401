The abode of heaven, earth, and so on (is Brahman), on account of the term\n'own,' i.e. Self.\n\nWe read (Mu. Up. II, 2, 5), 'He in whom the heaven, the earth, and the sky are\nwoven, the mind also with all the vital airs, know him alone as the Self, and\nleave off other words! He is the bridge of the Immortal.'--Here the doubt\narises whether the abode which is intimated by the statement of the heaven and\nso on being woven in it is the highest Brahman or something else.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the abode is something else, on account of the\nexpression, 'It is the bridge of the Immortal.' For, he says, it is known from\nevery-day experience that a bridge presupposes some further bank to which it\nleads, while it is impossible to assume something further beyond the highest\nBrahman, which in Scripture is called 'endless, without a further shore' (B\n_ri_. Up. II, 4, 12). Now if the abode is supposed to be something different\nfrom Brahman, it must be supposed to be either the pradhana known from Sm _ri_\nti, which, as being the (general) cause, may be called the (general) abode; or\nthe air known from _S_ ruti, of which it is said (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 2, 'Air\nis that thread, O Gautama. By air as by a thread, O Gautama, this world and\nthe other world and all beings are strung together'), that it supports all\nthings; or else the embodied soul which, as being the enjoyer, may be\nconsidered as an abode with reference to the objects of its fruition.\n\nAgainst this view we argue with the sutrakara as follows:--'Of the world\nconsisting of heaven, earth, and so on, which in the quoted passage is spoken\nof as woven (upon something), the highest Brahman must be the abode.'--Why?--\nOn account of the word 'own,' i.e. on account of the word 'Self.' For we meet\nwith the word 'Self' in the passage, 'Know him alone as the Self.' This term\n'Self' is\n\np. 155\n\nthoroughly appropriate only if we understand the highest Self and not anything\nelse.--(To propound another interpretation of the phrase 'sva _s_ abdat'\nemployed in the Sutra.) Sometimes also Brahman is spoken of in _S_ ruti as the\ngeneral abode by its own terms (i.e. by terms properly designating Brahman),\nas, for instance ( _Kh._ Up. VI. 8, 4), 'All these creatures, my dear, have\ntheir root in the being, their abode in the being, their rest in the being\n1.'--(Or else we have to explain 'sva _s_ abdena' as follows), In the passages\npreceding and following the passage under discussion Brahman is glorified with\nits own names 2; cp. Mu. Up. II, 1, 10, 'The Person is all this, sacrifice,\npenance, Brahman, the highest Immortal,' and II, 2, 11, 'That immortal Brahman\nis before, is behind, Brahman is to the right and left.' Here, on account of\nmention being made of an abode and that which abides, and on account of the\nco-ordination expressed in the passage, 'Brahman is all' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11),\na suspicion might arise that Brahman is of a manifold variegated nature, just\nas in the case of a tree consisting of different parts we distinguish\nbranches, stem, and root. In order to remove this suspicion the text declares\n(in the passage under discussion), 'Know him alone as the Self.' The sense of\nwhich is: The Self is not to be known as manifold, qualified by the universe\nof effects; you are rather to dissolve by true knowledge the universe of\neffects, which is the mere product of Nescience, and to know that one Self,\nwhich is the general abode, as uniform. Just as when somebody says, 'Bring\nthat on which Devadatta sits,' the person addressed brings the chair only (the\nabode of Devadatta), not Devadatta himself; so the passage, 'Know him alone as\nthe Self,' teaches that the object to be known is the one uniform Self which\nconstitutes the general abode. Similarly another scriptural passage reproves\nhim who believes in the unreal world of effects,\n\np. 156\n\n[paragraph continues] 'From death to death goes he who sees any difference\nhere'(Ka. Up. II, 4, 11). The statement of co-ordination made in the clause\n'All is Brahman' aims at dissolving (the wrong conception of the reality of)\nthe world, and not in any way at intimating that Brahman is multiform in\nnature 1; for the uniformity (of Brahman's nature) is expressly stated in\nother passages such as the following one, 'As a mass of salt has neither\ninside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of taste, thus indeed has that\nSelf neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of knowledge' (B\n_ri_. Up. IV, 5, 13).--For all these reasons the abode of heaven, earth, &c.\nis the highest Brahman.--Against the objection that on account of the text\nspeaking of a 'bridge,' and a bridge requiring a further bank, we have to\nunderstand by the abode of heaven and earth something different from Brahman,\nwe remark that the word 'bridge' is meant to intimate only that that which is\ncalled a bridge supports, not that it has a further bank. We need not assume\nby any means that the bridge meant is like an ordinary bridge made of clay and\nwood. For as the word setu (bridge) is derived from the root si, which means\n'to bind,' the idea of holding together, supporting is rather implied in it\nthan the idea of being connected with something beyond (a further bank).\n\nAccording to the opinion of another (commentator) the word 'bridge' does not\nglorify the abode of heaven, earth, &c., but rather the knowledge of the Self\nwhich is glorified in the preceding clause, 'Know him alone as the Self,' and\nthe abandonment of speech advised in the clause, 'leave off other words;' to\nthem, as being the means of obtaining immortality, the expression 'the bridge\nof the immortal' applies 2. On that account we have to set aside the assertion\nthat, on account of the word 'bridge,' something different from Brahman is to\nbe understood by the abode of heaven, earth, and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[155:1](sbe34070.htm#fr_168) From passages of which nature we may infer that\nin the passage under discussion also the 'abode' is Brahman.\n\n[155:2](sbe34070.htm#fr_169) From which circumstance we may conclude that the\npassage under discussion also refers to Brahman.\n\n[156:1](sbe34070.htm#fr_170) Yat sarvam avidyaropita _m_ tat sarva _m_\nparamarthato brahma na tu yad brahma tat sarvam ity artha _h_. Bhamati.\n\n[156:2](sbe34070.htm#fr_171) So that the passage would have to be translated,\n'That, viz. knowledge, &c. is the bridge of the Immortal.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 2](sbe34071.htm)\n\n"
