The troubled damsel sighed  \nSighs long and hot, and thus replied:  \n'What madness has possessed thy mind,  \nTo warnings deaf, to dangers blind?  \nCanst thou not see the floods of woe  \nThat threaten o'er thine head to flow:  \nFirst Rama will the throne acquire,  \nThen Rama's son succeed his sire,  \nWhile Bharat will neglected pine  \nExcluded from the royal line.  \nNot all his sons, O lady fair,  \nThe kingdom of a monarch share:  \nAll ruling when a sovereign dies  \nWild tumult in the state would rise.  \nThe eldest, be he good or ill,  \nIs ruler by the father's will.  \nKnow, tender mother, that thy son  \nWithout a friend and all undone.  \nFar from the joyous ease of home  \nAn alien from his race will roam.  \nI sped to thee for whom I feel,  \nBut thy fond heart mistakes my zeal,  \nThy hand a present would bestow  \nBecause thy rival triumphs so.  \nWhen Rama once begins his sway  \nWithout a foe his will to stay,  \nThy darling Bharat he will drive  \nTo distant lands if left alive.  \nBy thee the child was sent away  \nBeneath his grandsire's roof to stay.  \nEven in stocks and stones perforce  \nWill friendship spring from intercourse.  \nThe young S'atrughna too would go  \nWith Bharat, for he loved him so.  \nAs Lakshman still to Rama cleaves,  \nHe his dear Bharat never leaves.  \nThere is an ancient tale they tell:  \nA tree the foresters would fell  \nWas saved by reeds that round it stood,  \nFor love that sprang of neighbourhood.  \nSo Lakshman Rama will defend,  \nAnd each on each for aid depend.  \nSuch fame on earth their friendship wins  \nAs that which binds the Heavenly Twins.  \nAnd Rama ne'er will purpose wrong  \nTo Lakshman, for their love is strong.  \nBut Bharat, Oh, of this be sure,  \nMust evil at his hands endure.  \nCome, Rama from his home expel  \nAn exile in the woods to dwell.  \nThe plan, O Queen, which I advise  \nSecures thy weal if thou be wise,  \nSo we and all thy kith and kin  \nAdvantage from thy gain shall win.  \nShall Bharat, meet for happier fate,  \nBorn to endure his rival's hate,  \nWith all his fortune ruined cower  \nAnd dread his brother's mightier power!  \nUp, Queen, to save thy son, arise;  \nProstrate at Rama's feet he lies.  \nSo the proud elephant who leads  \nHis trooping consorts through the reeds  \nFalls in the forest shade beneath  \nThe lion's spring and murderous teeth.  \nScorned by thee in thy bliss and pride  \nKaus'alya was of old defied,  \nAnd will she now forbear to show  \nThe vengeful rancour of a foe?  \n   O Queen, thy darling is undone  \n   When Rama's hand has once begun  \n     Ayodhya's realm to sway,  \n   Come, win the kingdom for thy child  \n   And drive the alien to the wild  \n     In banishment to-day.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto IX.: The Plot.](ry087.htm)\n\n"
