Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja!\nyour paternal grandfather was a man of great wisdom, and apportioned the\nbusiness of the sacrifice to each, according to his observation of the\ncharacter of each. He made Bheem superintendent of the victualling department;\nhe appointed Suhdeo to look after the religious ceremonies; Nukool\'s office\nwas to bring money; Urjoon was appointed to be in constant attendance; Shree\nKrishnu Chund Jee took the duties of washing feet and clearing away what food\nwas left, and the treachers, formed of leaves; to Doorjodhun, the Raja\nassigned the business of distributing money; and every one of the Rajas\nreceived each some separate work. O great king! all did their work fairly,\nwith exception of Raja Doorjodhun, who practised the deceit of distributing\nmany times in place of only distributing once; thinking, and having determined\nin his mind, to break their bank, and thereby destroy their respectability.\nBut by the favour of Bhugwan, their respectability was not destroyed; on the\ncontrary, their character was enchanted, and therefore he was displeased, and\nhe did not know that there\n\np. 380\n\nwere lines in his hand, so that if he gave one rupee, four would be collected.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja! be\npleased now to listen to what follows in the narrative. On the departure of\nShree Krishnu Chund Jee, Raja Joodisthur, having entertained the Rajas,\nbestowed dresses of honour upon them, and behaved to them with the utmost\ncomplaisance, allowed them to take leave; and they arranged their several\narmies, and set out for their own countries. After this, Raja Joodisthur,\ntaking the Panduvus and Kouruvus with him, went, in musical procession, to\nbathe in the Ganges. Having arrived on the banks of the river, he made an\nobeisance; and, having rubbed dust on his body and sipping water in his hands,\nhe entered the stream with his wife; all the party bathed at the same time\nwith them. Then, when they had bathed and washed, and finished their\nmeditations and prayers, and adoration, and had put on their clothes and\nornaments; Raja Joodisthur, accompanied by them all, came to where the demon\nMye had built a most elegant house of gold, studded with jewels. O great king!\nhaving gone there, Raja Joodisthur sat upon a throne; at that time, celestial\nmusicians sang of his good qualities; bards and panegyrists recited his\ncelebrated deeds; in the midst of the assembly, dancing girls danced; inside\nand outside the house, musicians and singers played and sang songs of\nfestivity and rejoicing; and the court of the Raja Joodisthur appeared like\nthe court of Indru. In the mean while, when the Raja Doorjodhun heard of the\nRaja Joodisthur\'s arrival, he pretended friendship, and went there with great\npomp and parade to meet him.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! the demon Mye had contrived in the midst of a square\nenclosure, that whoever entered it, should mistake dry land for water, and\nwater for dry land. O great king! when the Raja Doorjodhun entered the\nenclosure, on seeing dry land, he thought that it was\n\np. 381\n\nwater, and pulled off all his clothes; having then gone a little further and\nseeing water, he mistook it for dry land; and, as he advanced, his clothes\nwetted. On observing this mistake of his, all the courtiers burst out\nlaughing, and Raja Joodisthur turned his head aside to prevent himself from\nlaughing. O great king! having heard them all laughing, Raja Doorjodhun was\nvery much ashamed and went away in great wrath. Having sat down in the court,\nhe began to say, "Since Joodisthur has obtained the support of Krishnu\'s\nstrength, he has become very proud. To-day, while he was sitting in the court,\nhe made all the courtiers laugh at me; I will revenge myself on him for this,\nand chastise his pride, otherwise my name is not Doorjodhun."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXVII](psa78.htm)\n\n'
