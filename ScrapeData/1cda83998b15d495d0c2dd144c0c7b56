When he shows his respect to Gurus or aged persons or guests, when he\noffers a burnt-oblation (or other sacrifice), when he murmurs prayers at\ndinner, when sipping water and during the (daily) recitation of the Veda, his\ngarment (or his sacrificial thread) shall pass over his left shoulder and\nunder his right arm. 1\n\n2\\. By sipping (pure) water, that has been collected on the ground, he becomes\npure. 2\n\n3\\. Or he, whom a pure person causes to sip water, (becomes also pure). 3\n\np. 55\n\n4\\. He shall not sip rain-drops. 4\n\n5\\. (He shall not sip water) from a (natural) cleft in the ground.\n\n6\\. He shall not sip water heated (at the fire) except for a particular reason\n(as sickness). 6\n\n7\\. He who raises his empty hands (in order to scare) birds, (becomes impure\nand) shall wash (his hands). 7\n\n8\\. If he can (find water to sip) he shall not remain impure (even) for a\nmuhurta.\n\n9\\. Nor (shall he remain) naked (for a muhurta if he can help it).\n\n10\\. Purification (by sipping water) shall not take place whilst he is\n(standing) in the water.\n\n11\\. Also, when he has crossed a river, he shall purify himself by sipping\nwater. 11\n\n12\\. He shall not place fuel on the fire, without having sprinkled it (with\nwater). 12\n\np. 56\n\n13\\. (If he is seated in company with) other unclean persons on a seat\nconsisting of a confused heap of straw, and does not touch them, he may\nconsider himself pure.\n\n14\\. (The same rule applies, if he is seated) on grass or wood fixed in the\nground. 14\n\n15\\. He shall put on a dress, (even if it is clean,) only after having\nsprinkled it with water. 15\n\n16\\. If he has been touched by a dog, he shall bathe, with his clothes on;\n\n17\\. Or he becomes pure, after having washed that part (of his body) and\nhaving touched it with fire and again washed it, as well as his feet, and\nhaving sipped water. 17\n\n18\\. Unpurified, he shall not approach fire, (so near that he can feel the\nheat). 18\n\n19\\. Some declare, that (he shall not approach nearer) than the length of an\narrow.\n\n20\\. Nor shall he blow on fire with his breath. 20\n\n21\\. Nor shall he place fire under his bedstead. 21\n\np. 57\n\n22\\. It is lawful for a Brahma _n_ a to dwell in a village, where there is\nplenty of fuel and water, (and) where he may perform the rites of purification\nby himself. 22\n\n23\\. When he has washed away the stains of urine and faeces after voiding\nurine or faeces, the stains of food (after dinner), the stains of the food\neaten the day before (from his vessels), and the stains of semen, and has also\nwashed his feet and afterwards has sipped water, he becomes pure. 23\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[54:1](sbe0218.htm#fr_342) **15**. Taitt. \xc3\x82r. II, 1, 2 seq.; Manu IV, 58.\n\n[54:2](sbe0218.htm#fr_343) Pure water is that which a cow will drink. Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_. I, 192; Manu V, 128.\n\n[54:3](sbe0218.htm#fr_344) The ceremony of \'sipping water\' may be performed in\ntwo ways; either the \'person sipping\' may take the water out of a river, pond,\n&c., or he may get the water poured into his hand by another person. But,\naccording to \xc3\x82pastamba, he must not take a pot or gourd in his left hand and\npour the water into his right, as some Sm _ri_ tis allow. The reason for this\nrule is, that \xc3\x82pastamba considers it essential that both hands should be used\nin conveying the water to the mouth; see also above, I, 1, 4, 21. This agrees\nwith the custom now followed, which is to bend the right hand into the form of\na cow\'s ear, and to touch the right wrist with the left hand while drinking.\n\n[55:4](sbe0218.htm#fr_345) \'Some think, that this Sutra is intended to forbid\nalso the drinking of rain-water. Other commentators declare that, according to\nthis Sutra, it is allowed to use for "sipping" drops of water which fall from\na vessel suspended by ropes [because the Sutra emphatically excludes "rain-\ndrops only].\'--Haradatta.\n\n[55:6](sbe0218.htm#fr_346) Manu II, 61. \'Because the term "heated by fire" is\nused, there is no objection to water heated by the rays of the sun. In the\nsame manner the use of, "hot" water only is usually forbidden in the Sm _ri_\ntis.\'-- Haradatta.\n\n[55:7](sbe0218.htm#fr_347) \'Because the phrase "with empty hands" is used, he\ncommits no fault if he raises his hand, holding a stick or a clod. Some\ndeclare, that the term "touching water" (rendered by "washing means "sipping\nwater."\'--Haradatta.\n\n[55:11](sbe0218.htm#fr_348) The translation given above is based on the\ninterpretation of Haradatta, who considers that \xc3\x82pastamba holds \'crossing a\nriver\' to cause impurity. The natural and probably the right interpretation,\nhowever, is that rejected by Haradatta, \'But he shall sip water after having\ncome out (of the river or tank).\'\n\n[55:12](sbe0218.htm#fr_349) \'"On the fire used for Vedic or Smarta sacrifices\nor for household purposes.". . . Some declare, that (the fuel need not be\nsprinkled with water) if used for the kitchen fire.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[56:14](sbe0218.htm#fr_350) Haradatta\'s commentary is of little use, and I am\nnot quite certain that my translation is correct.\n\n[56:15](sbe0218.htm#fr_351) Manu V, 118.\n\n[56:17](sbe0218.htm#fr_352) This second proceeding is adopted in case the dog\nhas touched the hands or the lower parts of the body, as may be learnt by the\ncomparison of a verse of Manu.\n\n[56:18](sbe0218.htm#fr_353) Manu IV, 142; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 155.\n\n[56:20](sbe0218.htm#fr_354) Manu IV, 53. Haradatta mentions other explanations\nof this Sutra. Some say, that the _S_ rauta fire may be kindled by blowing,\nbecause that is ordained particularly in the Va _g_ asaneyaka, but that the\ndomestic fire is not to be treated so. Others again consider the rule\nabsolute, and say, that a hollow reed or bellows must be used for kindling the\nfire, lest drops of saliva should fall upon it.\n\n[56:21](sbe0218.htm#fr_355) Manu IV, 54.\n\n[57:22](sbe0218.htm#fr_356) The last condition mentioned in the Sutra\nindicates, that the place must have a river or tank, not wells only, as the\npurification by sipping water cannot be performed without help, with water\nfrom wells.\n\n[57:23](sbe0218.htm#fr_357) Manu V, 138.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 5, Kha _n_ _d_ a 16](sbe0219.htm)\n\n'
