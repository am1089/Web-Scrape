Out of the spoils of Marathon, Athene Promachos was set to watch,\nfrom the rocky summit of the Acropolis, over the city of violets, only\nbecause, beside the hearths of Athens, for more than two centuries before the\ntime of Pheidias, her name had been a household word. But if we would know\nsomething of that long anterior thought and dreaming that made her and the\nGoddess of the Parthenon what they have become to us and to our children, we\ncannot do better than study the question here in Bengal, in the simple\nworships of the months as they go by. For Greece in her golden age, though\npolitically emancipated, was intellectually but a province of Asia, and in\nHindu India to-day that same Asia is still alive and in full vigour. Pater\'s\nRoman study of Marius the Epicurean, laying his violets and cake with the\nfragment of honeycomb on the votive shelf before the tablets of his ancestors\nand\n\np. 49\n\nof the gods, would apply with precision to the Bengali woman of this present\nyear of grace, offering _prasadam_ and flowers, with grass and water, before\nthe household deity in her _thakur-ghar_. The _thakur-ghar_ , or private\noratory, is sufficient for the needs of the daily worship of the family. But\nwhen the great _pujas_ come round the image is erected downstairs, in the hall\nthat runs along the side of the front court--the noblest apartment in the\nhouse--and the whole dwelling falls into subordination as a temple of the\ngods.\n\nMan has had many dreams of the Divine Wisdom, but surely few so touching as\nthis of Saraswati in Bengal. A simple woman, ascetic and poor, standing on the\nwhite lotus, surrounded by flowers, not jewels, suggestive of all things white\nand colourless and simple, and carrying the mystic Vina, from which the touch\nof her hand is bringing a secret music--this is she who has been our guest. In\nthe Dekkan and in Maharashtra, they picture her riding on the peacock, and\nMhattre\'s beautiful statue, with its decorative draperies and crown-like hair,\ncarries not a little splendour with it. But in Bengal the goddess is somewhat\nwidowlike--not actually a widow, for among her offerings is the iron bracelet\nof the wife--true daughter of the ascetics and patron of poor students,\nimpossible to confound with Lakshmi, her sister of Good Fortune.\n\np. 50\n\nSeeing it for the first time at sunset or at dawn, one learns to appreciate\nthe dainty curves of the image: the gleaming white, the light and springing\nattitude, as of one scarcely touching the flower on which she stands. But it\nis not even necessary to have an image in order to worship Saraswati. It is\nquite sufficient, instead, to set one\'s inkstand and pens in her hallowed\nplace, and offer to them our salutation and affection. For Saraswati dwells\nand is found in these, the humble creatures of learning; and in token thereof\n--in full accord with the Hindu horror of confounding use and worship--her\nworshippers are forbidden to open a book or touch their writing materials\nthroughout her festival.\n\nA world of childish associations and tender joys lies hidden beneath the\nobservance of the _Saraswati Puja_. Kind uncles and fathers stay at home\ntoday, and prove the value of leisured masculinity by their readiness to\nascend step-ladders and nail the auspicious strings of mango-leaves above the\nentrance, and carry pots of water and place them, covered with cocoanuts, and\nembowered beneath tall plantain-sterns, against portals and pillars\neverywhere. And the children themselves are all hilarity. To hold hammer and\nnails, or carry flowers and mats, seems the height of glory. In the kitchen\nthe ladies of the house are busy preparing food and dressing many-coloured\nfruits. The happy\n\np. 51\n\nbustle of an English Christmas prevades the household, all to culminate in the\nsolemn worship, about noon, when the Austere Spirit of Learning will be\ninvoked, and implored to make this hospice of her two-days\' visitation her\nhome and abode throughout the coming year.\n\nIn the making of the altar-place itself, how much to do! First must the place\nbe cleansed and sanctified. Then, on a wooden stand, the image is set up and\nall the necessary appurtenances of Saraswati\'s manifestation arranged about\nher in due order. Reed pens of an ancient make, curious earthen ink-wells, of\nno modern pattern, a quaint toilet-basket, with combs and scented oils, a\nsmall round mirror, and powders and earthenware vessels innumerable, are all\n_de rigueur_ on this occasion. Let priests and theologians explain the mirror\nhow they will, as symbolising the reflection of the Divinity in the unclouded\nmind, or _buddhi_ \\--it strikes the newcomer very forcibly that, in sentiment\nat least, the goddess is to some extent a lady visitant, to whom the\nprivileges and courtesies of womanhood must be extended; for whom, indeed, her\nsister-women will think many luxuries necessary that they could by no means\nafford for themselves. Last, and most striking, perhaps, of the preliminary\nceremonies is the enclosing of the sacred space. Balls of mud are set at the\nfour corners. In these are placed arrows with the\n\np. 52\n\npoints downwards, and then--in the case of Saraswati white, in that of other\nimages red--thread is passed from corner to corner, a palisade of cord and\narrows. Under what conditions of forest and hunt were the Hindu images first\nset up for worship?\n\nThe name Saraswati occurs in the Vedas themselves, and we can gather its\nprimitive significance from the fact that it was applied to that river on\nwhose banks were performed all the holiest sacrifices. The word is a\n[synonym](errata.htm#1) also for Savitri, which is one of the names of the\nGayatri, or national prayer. So that in a very special sense it is said by\nHindus of this, their Divine Wisdom, that she is the eternal consort of the\nCreator, and sprang, full-grown, from the countenance of Narayan, the Lord of\nthe Worlds. "O Thou without Whom the Creator Himself abideth not, abide with\nus!" runs one of the prayers, and the enumeration that follows of the\neightfold desirable attributes of the mind is curiously subtle. A distinction\nis drawn, for instance, between memory and the power to call up the thing\nremembered at the right time and place.\n\nThere is, humanly speaking, understood to be a silent unyielding grudge\nbetween Saraswati and her sister Lakshmi, the Mistress of Fortune. To be\nentirely abandoned by Lakshmi is a terrible\n\np. 53\n\ncurse. It means to become devoid of all beauty and charm of every kind; to be,\nin the world of men, as an owl hooting in the wilderness. Even Saraswati, too,\nmust have recourse to the good offices of Lakshmi for that measure of oats and\nmidnight oil which is the essential wealth of the poor student. But it would\nbe foolish to look, in the case of either sister, for the bestowal of the\nfulness of her benediction on the ardent adorer of the other. Each is very\njealous, and gives herself completely only to a whole heart and an undivided\naffection. Especially is it true of this plainly-garbed Mother, throned on the\nwhite lotus, that she stands in right queenly strength on her own simplicity,\nand grants but the crumbs of her feast to him who has a squinting regard for\nthe good things of life\'s banquet. How quietly thus, in a half-sarcastic myth,\nhas India foretold the disaster to learning that would come of modern\ncommercialism! The lore of Saraswati has other points of significance. All\nbooks and manuscripts--Persian and English to the full as much as classic\nSanskrit--are sacred to her. We find plenty of science and geography among the\nschoolbooks that the boys place on her altar shyly, to be blessed by the touch\nof her feet. There is no suspicion in India of divorce between faith and\nknowledge, between the Divine Creator and the Divine Wisdom. The thing sounds\nfoolish. Is\n\np. 54\n\nnot religion the highest knowledge, knowledge itself the highest faith?\n\nThus we gather that there is in Hinduism full sanction for the difficult\nintellectual transition through which the present generations are passing. The\nMother blesses that absorption in intellectual problems that forgets her name.\nShe accepts such oblivion as the most precious form of worship. But it must be\nthe pursuit of knowledge for the sake of knowledge, not for that of its loaves\nand fishes. Those of us who have learned to regard the present Indian crisis\nas one almost entirely of mind and thought will realise the dynamic power of\nthese conceptions. For on no other terms than those of a complete\nappropriation of new forms of disinterested culture can the nation hope to\ntake its true place in the modern world. And to such an excursion of the\nintellect its ancient sources of authority offer full encouragement and\nbenediction. Without any break with her own past, India might learn to stand\nin the very van of modern progress. Some understanding of such facts, more or\nless dim, penetrates even the humblest household in which the image of\nSaraswati is set up. What is lacking is a sense of contrast, the knowledge\nthat in such a breadth of view there is anything startling or extraordinary.\n\nSaraswati in modern India is the favourite goddess of every home, even as\nAthene must have\n\np. 55\n\nbeen in almost prehistoric Athens. But the altar of Athene was the cradle of a\ngreat civic life and organisation, and the throne of Saraswati has up to the\npresent inculcated only an invisible culture--mediaeval in its intensity--of\nheart and soul. Treasures of Indian psychology, treasures of Indian thought,\nlie scattered by the roadside for him who cares to follow out with attention\nthe winding paths of Hindu worship. Yet none who has watched the procession of\nthe image to the river can doubt that the Indian pujas of to-day, like the\nGreek of old, contain within themselves great civic possibilities.\n\nFor the two days, with their constant succession of sacred offices, are gone.\nAll night long the lights burned about the shrine, and long after evenfall an\noccasional passer-by, noting the garland of leaves above the entrance, would\npush open the door and enter the courtyard to spend a few moments in the\npresence of the altar. Ever since the consecration of the image we have gone\nabout on tiptoe and spoken almost in whispers, feeling that the house was not\nour own, but the dwelling-place of gods. And now the second evensong is come,\nand after the pathetic ceremony of the Farewell Charge is done among the\nwomen, the goddess goes forth, amidst attendant drums and heralds, to\ndisappear from the eyes of mortals in that flood wherein all that is is holy.\nCrowded\n\np. 56\n\nstreets and river-bank await her coming, and even as the one procession goes\nout it meets another coming in, bearing the pots of Ganges water from which in\nthe growing dusk the "water of peace" will be sprinkled on kneeling\nworshippers, while the last blessings are pronounced in the chamber where for\ntwo days she had stood. How exquisite is this moment of "the water of peace";\nhow full of devotion are prayers and prostrations! And among the lengthening\nshadows there steals about us the sense of something more real than physical\npresence, and we wonder if to us also has come some of the fruit of the\nancient prayer to the Divine Wisdom, "O Thou without whom the Creator Himself\nabideth not, abide with us!"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Durga Puja](seh13.htm)\n\n'
