In fact,\nall the modern civilisations have their cradles of brick and mortar.\n\nThese walls leave their mark deep in the minds of men. They set up a principle\nof "divide and rule" in our mental outlook, which begets in us a habit of\nsecuring all our conquests by fortifying them and separating them from one\nanother. We divide nation and nation, knowledge and knowledge, man and nature.\nIt breeds in us a strong suspicion of whatever is beyond the barriers we have\nbuilt, and everything has to fight hard for its entrance into our recognition.\n\nWhen the first Aryan invaders appeared in India it was a vast land of forests,\nand the new-comers rapidly took advantage of them. These forests afforded them\nshelter from the fierce heat of the sun and the ravages of tropical storms,\npastures for cattle, fuel for sacrificial fire, and materials for building\ncottages. And the different Aryan clans with their patriarchal heads settled\nin the different forest tracts which had some special advantage of natural\nprotection, and food and water in plenty.\n\nThus in India it was in the forests that our civilisation had its birth, and\nit took a distinct character from this origin and environment. It was\nsurrounded by the vast life of nature, was fed and clothed by her, and had the\nclosest and most constant intercourse with her varying aspects.\n\nSuch a life, it may be thought, tends to have the effect of dulling human\nintelligence and dwarfing the incentives to progress by lowering the standards\nof existence. But in ancient India we find that the circumstances of forest\nlife did not overcome man\'s mind, and did not enfeeble the current of his\nenergies, but only gave to it a particular direction. Having been in constant\ncontact with the living growth of nature, his mind was free from the desire to\nextend his dominion by erecting boundary walls around his acquisitions. His\naim was not to acquire but to realise, to enlarge his consciousness by growing\nwith and growing into his surroundings. He felt that truth is all-\ncomprehensive, that there is no such thing as absolute isolation in existence,\nand the only way of attaining truth is through the interpenetration of our\nbeing into all objects. To realise this great harmony between man\'s spirit and\nthe spirit of the world was the endeavour of the forest-dwelling sages of\nancient India.\n\nIn later days there came a time when these primeval forests gave way to\ncultivated fields, and wealthy cities sprang up on all sides. Mighty kingdoms\nwere established, which had communications with all the great powers of the\nworld. But even in the heyday of its material prosperity the heart of India\never looked back with adoration upon the early ideal of strenuous self-\nrealisation, and the dignity of the simple life of the forest hermitage, and\ndrew its best inspiration from the wisdom stored there.\n\nThe west seems to take a pride in thinking that it is subduing nature; as if\nwe are living in a hostile world where we have to wrest everything we want\nfrom an unwilling and alien arrangement of things. This sentiment is the\nproduct of the city-wall habit and training of mind. For in the city life man\nnaturally directs the concentrated light of his mental vision upon his own\nlife and works, and this creates an artificial dissociation between himself\nand the Universal Nature within whose bosom he lies.\n\nBut in India the point of view was different; it included the world with the\nman as one great truth. India put all her emphasis on the harmony that exists\nbetween the individual and the universal. She felt we could have no\ncommunication whatever with our surroundings if they were absolutely foreign\nto us. Man\'s complaint against nature is that he has to acquire most of his\nnecessaries by his own efforts. Yes, but his efforts are not in vain; he is\nreaping success every day, and that shows there is a rational connection\nbetween him and nature, for we never can make anything our own except that\nwhich is truly related to us.\n\nWe can look upon a road from two different points of view. One regards it as\ndividing us from the object of our desire; in that case we count every step of\nour journey over it as something attained by force in the face of obstruction.\nThe other sees it as the road which leads us to our destination; and as such\nit is part of our goal. It is already the beginning of our attainment, and by\njourneying over it we can only gain that which in itself it offers to us. This\nlast point of view is that of India with regard to nature. For her, the great\nfact is that we are in harmony with nature; that man can think because his\nthoughts are in harmony with things; that he can use the forces of nature for\nhis own purpose only because his power is in harmony with the power which is\nuniversal, and that in the long run his purpose never can knock against the\npurpose which works through nature.\n\nIn the west the prevalent feeling is that nature belongs exclusively to\ninanimate things and to beasts, that there is a sudden unaccountable break\nwhere human-nature begins. According to it, everything that is low in the\nscale of beings is merely nature, and whatever has the stamp of perfection on\nit, intellectual or moral, is human-nature. It is like dividing the bud and\nthe blossom into two separate categories, and putting their grace to the\ncredit of two different and antithetical principles. But the Indian mind never\nhas any hesitation in acknowledging its kinship with nature, its unbroken\nrelation with all.\n\nThe fundamental unity of creation was not simply a philosophical speculation\nfor India; it was her life-object to realise this great harmony in feeling and\nin action. With mediation and service, with a regulation of life, she\ncultivated her consciousness in such a way that everything had a spiritual\nmeaning to her. The earth, water and light, fruits and flowers, to her were\nnot merely physical phenomena to be turned to use and then left aside. They\nwere necessary to her in the attainment of her ideal of perfection, as every\nnote is necessary to the completeness of the symphony. India intuitively felt\nthat the essential fact of this world has a vital meaning for us; we have to\nbe fully alive to it and establish a conscious relation with it, not merely\nimpelled by scientific curiosity or greed of material advantage, but realising\nit in the spirit of sympathy, with a large feeling of joy and peace.\n\nThe man of science knows, in one aspect, that the world is not merely what it\nappears to be to our senses; he knows that earth and water are really the play\nof forces that manifest themselves to us as earth and water--how, we can but\npartially apprehend. Likewise the man who has his spiritual eyes open knows\nthat the ultimate truth about earth and water lies in our apprehension of the\neternal will which works in time and takes shape in the forces we realise\nunder those aspects. This is not mere knowledge, as science is, but it is a\npreception of the soul by the soul. This does not lead us to power, as\nknowledge does, but it gives us joy, which is the product of the union of\nkindred things. The man whose acquaintance with the world does not lead him\ndeeper than science leads him, will never understand what it is that the man\nwith the spiritual vision finds in these natural phenomena. The water does not\nmerely cleanse his limbs, but it purifies his heart; for it touches his soul.\nThe earth does not merely hold his body, but it gladdens his mind; for its\ncontact is more than a physical contact--it is a living presence. When a man\ndoes not realise his kinship with the world, he lives in a prison-house whose\nwalls are alien to him. When he meets the eternal spirit in all objects, then\nis he emancipated, for then he discovers the fullest significance of the world\ninto which he is born; then he finds himself in perfect truth, and his harmony\nwith the all is established. In India men are enjoined to be fully awake to\nthe fact that they are in the closest relation to things around them, body and\nsoul, and that they are to hail the morning sun, the flowing water, the\nfruitful earth, as the manifestation of the same living truth which holds them\nin its embrace. Thus the text of our everyday meditation is the _Gayathri_ , a\nverse which is considered to be the epitome of all the Vedas. By its help we\ntry to realise the essential unity of the world with the conscious soul of\nman; we learn to perceive the unity held together by the one Eternal Spirit,\nwhose power creates the earth, the sky, and the stars, and at the same time\nirradiates our minds with the light of a consciousness that moves and exists\nin unbroken continuity with the outer world.\n\nIt is not true that India has tried to ignore differences of value in\ndifferent things, for she knows that would make life impossible. The sense of\nthe superiority of man in the scale of creation has not been absent from her\nmind. But she has had her own idea as to that in which his superiority really\nconsists. It is not in the power of possession but in the power of union.\nTherefore India chose her places of pilgrimage wherever there was in nature\nsome special grandeur or beauty, so that her mind could come out of its world\nof narrow necessities and realise its place in the infinite. This was the\nreason why in India a whole people who once were meat-eaters gave up taking\nanimal food to cultivate the sentiment of universal sympathy for life, an\nevent unique in the history of mankind.\n\nIndia knew that when by physical and mental barriers we violently detach\nourselves from the inexhaustible life of nature; when we become merely man,\nbut not man-in-the-universe, we create bewildering problems, and having shut\noff the source of their solution, we try all kinds of artificial methods each\nof which brings its own crop of interminable difficulties. When man leaves his\nresting-place in universal nature, when he walks on the single rope of\nhumanity, it means either a dance or a fall for him, he has ceaselessly to\nstrain every nerve and muscle to keep his balance at each step, and then, in\nthe intervals of his weariness, he fulminates against Providence and feels a\nsecret pride and satisfaction in thinking that he has been unfairly dealt with\nby the whole scheme of things.\n\nBut this cannot go on for ever. Man must realise the wholeness of his\nexistence, his place in the infinite; he must know that hard as he may strive\nhe can never create his honey within the cells of his hive; for the perennial\nsupply of his life food is outside their walls. He must know that when man\nshuts himself out from the vitalising and purifying touch of the infinite, and\nfalls back upon himself for his sustenance and his healing, then he goads\nhimself into madness, tears himself into shreds, and eats his own substance.\nDeprived of the background of the whole, his poverty loses its one great\nquality, which is simplicity, and becomes squalid and shamefaced. His wealth\nis no longer magnanimous; it grows merely extravagant. His appetites do not\nminister to his life, keeping to the limits of their purpose; they become an\nend in themselves and set fire to his life and play the fiddle in the lurid\nlight of the conflagration. Then it is that in our self-expression we try to\nstartle and not to attract; in art we strive for originality and lose sight of\ntruth which is old and yet ever new; in literature we miss the complete view\nof man which is simple and yet great, but he appears as a psychological\nproblem or the embodiment of a passion that is intense because abnormal and\nbecause exhibited in the glare of a fiercely emphatic light which is\nartificial. When man\'s consciousness is restricted only to the immediate\nvicinity of his human self, the deeper roots of his nature do not find their\npermanent soil, his spirit is ever on the brink of starvation, and in the\nplace of healthful strength he substitutes rounds of stimulation. Then it is\nthat man misses his inner perspective and measures his greatness by its bulk\nand not by its vital link with the infinite, judges his activity by its\nmovement and not by the repose of perfection--the repose which is in the\nstarry heavens, in the ever-flowing rhythmic dance of creation.\n\nThe first invasion of India has its exact parallel in the invasion of America\nby the European settlers. They also were confronted with primeval forests and\na fierce struggle with aboriginal races. But this struggle between man and\nman, and man and nature lasted till the very end; they never came to any\nterms. In India the forests which were the habitation of the barbarians became\nthe sanctuary of sages, but in America these great living cathedrals of nature\nhad no deeper significance to man. The brought wealth and power to him, and\nperhaps at times they ministered to his enjoyment of beauty, and inspired a\nsolitary poet. They never acquired a sacred association in the hearts of men\nas the site of some great spiritual reconcilement where man\'s soul has its\nmeeting-place with the soul of the world.\n\nI do not for a moment wish to suggest that these things should have been\notherwise. It would be an utter waste of opportunities if history were to\nrepeat itself exactly in the same manner in every place. It is best for the\ncommerce of the spirit that people differently situated should bring their\ndifferent products into the market of humanity, each of which is complementary\nand necessary to the others. All that I wish to say is that India at the\noutset of her career met with a special combination of circumstances which was\nnot lost upon her. She had, according to her opportunities, thought and\npondered, striven and suffered, dived into the depths of existence, and\nachieved something which surely cannot be without its value to people whose\nevolution in history took a different way altogether. Man for his perfect\ngrowth requires all the living elements that constitute his complex life; that\nis why his food has to be cultivated in different fields and brought from\ndifferent sources.\n\nCivilisation is a kind of mould that each nation is busy making for itself to\nshape its men and women according to its best ideal. All its institutions, its\nlegislature, its standard of approbation and condemnation, its conscious and\nunconscious teachings tend toward that object. The modern civilisation of the\nwest, by all its organised efforts, is trying to turn out men perfect in\nphysical, intellectual, and moral efficiency. There the vast energies of the\nnations are employed in extending man\'s power over his surroundings, and\npeople are combining and straining every faculty to possess and to turn to\naccount all that they can lay their hands upon, to overcome every obstacle on\ntheir path of conquest. They are ever disciplining themselves to fight nature\nand other races; their armaments are getting more and more stupendous every\nday; their machines, their appliances, their organisations go on multiplying\nat an amazing rate. This is a splendid achievement, no doubt, and a wonderful\nmanifestation of man\'s masterfulness which knows no obstacle, and which has\nfor its object the supremacy of himself over everything else.\n\nThe ancient civilisation of India had its own ideal of perfection towards\nwhich its efforts were directed. Its aim was not attaining power, and it\nneglected to cultivate to the utmost its capacities, and to organise men for\ndefensive and offensive purposes, for co-operation in the acquisition of\nwealth and for military and political ascendancy. The ideal that India tried\nto realise led her best men to the isolation of a contemplative life, and the\ntreasures that she gained for mankind by penetrating into the mysteries of\nreality cost her dear in the sphere of worldly success. Yet, this also was a\nsublime achievement,--it was a supreme manifestation of that human aspiration\nwhich knows no limit, and which has for its object nothing less than the\nrealisation of the Infinite.\n\nThere were the virtuous, the wise, the courageous; there were the statesmen,\nkings and emperors of India; but whom amongst all these classes did she look\nup to and choose to be the representative of men?\n\nThey were the rishis. What were the rishis? _They who having attained the\nsupreme soul in knowledge were filled with wisdom, and having found him in\nunion with the soul were in perfect harmony with the inner self; they having\nrealised him in the heart were free from all selfish desires, and having\nexperienced him in all the activities of the world, had attained calmness. The\nrishis were they who having reached the supreme God from all sides had found\nabiding peace, had become united with all, had entered into the life of the\nUniverse._  1\n\nThus the state of realising our relationship with all, of entering into\neverything through union with God, was considered in India to be the ultimate\nend and fulfilment of humanity.\n\nMan can destroy and plunder, earn and accumulate, invent and discover, but he\nis great because his soul comprehends all. It is dire destruction for him when\nhe envelopes his soul in a dead shell of callous habits, and when a blind fury\nof works whirls round him like an eddying dust storm, shutting out the\nhorizon. That indeed kills the very spirit of his being, which is the spirit\nof comprehension. Essentially man is not a slave either of himself or of the\nworld; but he is a lover. His freedom and fulfilment is in love, which is\nanother name for perfect comprehension. By this power of comprehension, this\npermeation of his being, he is united with the all-pervading Spirit, who is\nalso the breath of his soul. Where a man tries to raise himself to eminence by\npushing and jostling all others, to achieve a distinction by which he prides\nhimself to be more than everybody else, there he is alienated from that\nSpirit. This is why the Upanishads describe those who have attained the goal\nof human life as " _peaceful_ "  2 and as " _at-one-with- God_ ,"  3 meaning\nthat they are in perfect harmony with man and nature, and therefore in\nundisturbed union with God.\n\nWe have a glimpse of the same truth in the teachings of Jesus when he says,\n"It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich\nman to enter the kingdom of Heaven"-- which implies that whatever we treasure\nfor ourselves separates us from others; our possessions are our limitations.\nHe who is bent upon accumulating riches is unable, with his ego continually\nbulging, to pass through the gates of comprehension of the spiritual world,\nwhich is the world of perfect harmony; he is shut up within the narrow walls\nof his limited acquisitions.\n\nHence the spirit of the teachings of Upanishad is: In order to find him you\nmust embrace all. In the pursuit of wealth you really give up everything to\ngain a few things, and that is not the way to attain him who is completeness.\n\nSome modern philosophers of Europe, who are directly or indirectly indebted to\nthe Upanishads, far from realising their debt, maintain that the Brahma of\nIndia is a mere abstraction, a negation of all that is in the world. In a\nword, that the Infinite Being is to be found nowhere except in metaphysics. It\nmay be, that such a doctrine has been and still is prevalent with a section of\nour countrymen. But this is certainly not in accord with the pervading spirit\nof the Indian mind. Instead, it is the practice of realising and affirming the\npresence of the infinite in all things which has been its constant\ninspiration.\n\nWe are enjoined to see _whatever there is in the world as being enveloped by\nGod._  4\n\n_I bow to God over and over again who is in fire and in water, who permeates\nthe whole world, who is in the annual crops as well as in the perennial\ntrees._  5\n\nCan this be God abstracted from the world? Instead, it signifies not merely\nseeing him in all things, but saluting him in all the objects of the world.\nThe attitude of the God-conscious man of the Upanishad towards the universe is\none of a deep feeling of adoration. His object of worship is present\neverywhere. It is the one living truth that makes all realities true. This\ntruth is not only of knowledge but of devotion. \' _Namonamah_ ,\'--we bow to\nhim everywhere, and over and over again. It is recognised in the outburst of\nthe Rishi, who addresses the whole world in a sudden ecstasy of joy: _Listen\nto me, ye sons of the immortal spirit, ye who live in the heavenly abode, I\nhave known the Supreme Person whose light shines forth from beyond the\ndarkness._  6 Do we not find the overwhelming delight of a direct and positive\nexperience where there is not the least trace of vagueness or passivity?\n\nBuddha who developed the practical side of the teaching of Upanishads,\npreached the same message when he said, _With everything, whether it is above\nor below, remote or near, visible or invisible, thou shalt preserve a relation\nof unlimited love without any animosity or without a desire to kill. To live\nin such a consciousness while standing or walking, sitting or lying down till\nyou are asleep, is Brahma vih \xc4\x81ra, or, in other words, is living and moving\nand having your joy in the spirit of Brahma._\n\nWhat is that spirit? The Upanishad says, _The being who is in his essence the\nlight and life of all, who is world-conscious, is Brahma._  7 To feel all, to\nbe conscious of everything, is his spirit. We are immersed in his\nconsciousness body and soul. It is through his consciousness that the sun\nattracts the earth; it is through his consciousness that the light-waves are\nbeing transmitted from planet to planet.\n\nNot only in space, but _this light and life, this all-feeling being is in our\nsouls._  8 He is all-conscious in space, or the world of extension; and he is\nall-conscious in soul, or the world of intension.\n\nThus to attain our world-consciousness, we have to unite our feeling with this\nall-pervasive infinite feeling. In fact, the only true human progress is\ncoincident with this widening of the range of feeling. All our poetry,\nphilosophy, science, art and religion are serving to extend the scope of our\nconsciousness towards higher and larger spheres. Man does not acquire rights\nthrough occupation of larger space, nor through external conduct, but his\nrights extend only so far as he is real, and his reality is measured by the\nscope of his consciousness.\n\nWe have, however, to pay a price for this attainment of the freedom of\nconsciousness. What is the price? It is to give one\'s self away. Our soul can\nrealise itself truly only by denying itself. The Upanishad says, _Thou shalt\ngain by giving away_  9 , _Thou shalt not covet._  10\n\nIn Gita we are advised to work disinterestedly, abandoning all lust for the\nresult. Many outsiders conclude from this teaching that the conception of the\nworld as something unreal lies at the root of the so-called disinterestedness\npreached in India. But the reverse is true.\n\nThe man who aims at his own aggrandisement underrates everything else.\nCompared to his ego the rest of the world is unreal. Thus in order to be fully\nconscious of the reality of all, one has to be free himself from the bonds of\npersonal desires. This discipline we have to go through to prepare ourselves\nfor our social duties--for sharing the burdens of our fellow-beings. Every\nendeavour to attain a larger life requires of man "to gain by giving away, and\nnot to be greedy." And thus to expand gradually the consciousness of one\'s\nunity with all is the striving of humanity.\n\nThe Infinite in India was not a thin nonentity, void of all content. The\nRishis of India asserted emphatically, "To know him in this life is to be\ntrue; not to know him in this life is the desolation of death."  11 How to\nknow him then? "By realising him in each and all."  12 Not only in nature but\nin the family, in society, and in the state, the more we realise the World-\nconscious in all, the better for us. Failing to realise it, we turn our faces\nto destruction.\n\nIt fills me with great joy and a high hope for the future of humanity when I\nrealise that there was a time in the remote past when our poet-prophets stood\nunder the lavish sunshine of an Indian sky and greeted the world with the glad\nrecognition of kindred. It was not an anthropomorphic hallucination. It was\nnot seeing man reflected everywhere in grotesquely exaggerated images, and\nwitnessing the human drama acted on a gigantic scale in nature\'s arena of\nflitting lights and shadows. On the contrary, it meant crossing the limiting\nbarriers of the individual, to become more than man, to become one with the\nAll. It was not a mere play of the imagination, but it was the liberation of\nconsciousness from all the mystifications and exaggerations of the self. These\nancient seers felt in the serene depth of their mind that the same energy\nwhich vibrates and passes into the endless forms of the world manifests itself\nin our inner being as consciousness; and there is no break in unity. For these\nseers there was no gap in their luminous vision of perfection. They never\nacknowledged even death itself as creating a chasm in the field of reality.\nThey said, _His reflection is death as well as immortality._  13 They did not\nrecognise any essential opposition between life and death, and they said with\nabsolute assurance, "It is life that is death."  14 They saluted with the same\nserenity of gladness "life in its aspect of appearing and in its aspect of\ndeparture"-- _That which is past is hidden in life, and that which is to\ncome._  15 They knew that mere appearance and disappearance are on the surface\nlike waves on the sea, but life which is permanent knows no decay or\ndiminution.\n\n_Everything has sprung from immortal life and is vibrating with life_ ,  16\n_for life is immense._  17\n\nThis is the noble heritage from our forefathers waiting to be claimed by us as\nour own, this ideal of the supreme freedom of consciousness. It is not merely\nintellectual or emotional, it has an ethical basis, and it must be translated\ninto action. In the Upanishad it is said, _The supreme being is all-pervading,\ntherefore he is the innate good in all._  18 To be truly united in knowledge,\nlove, and service with all beings, and thus to realise one\'s self in the all-\npervading God is the essence of goodness, and this is the keynote of the\nteachings of the Upanishads: _Life is immense!_  19\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](sadh03.htm#fr_0)\n\nSampr\xc4\x81pyainam rishayo j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81natripat\xc4\x81h  \nKrit\xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81n\xc5\x8d v\xc4\xabtar\xc4\x81g\xc4\x81h pra\xc3\xa7ant\xc4\x81h  \nt\xc4\x93 sarvagam sarvatah pr\xc4\x81pya dh\xc4\xabr\xc4\x81h  \nYukt\xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81nah sarvam\xc4\x93v\xc4\x81vi\xc3\xa7anti.  \n\n[2](sadh03.htm#fr_1) Pra\xc3\xa7ant\xc4\x81h\n\n[3](sadh03.htm#fr_2) Yukt\xc4\x81tm\xc4\x81nah\n\n[4](sadh03.htm#fr_3) I\xc3\xa7\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81syamidam sarvam yat ki\xc3\xb1cha jagaty\xc4\x81\xc3\xb1 jagat.\n\n[5](sadh03.htm#fr_4) Yo d\xc4\x93v\xc5\x8d\'gnau y\'\xc5\x8dpsu y\'\xc5\x8d vi\xc3\xa7vambhuvanam\xc4\x81viv\xc4\x93\xc3\xa7a ya\n\xc5\x8dshadhishu y\xc5\x8d vanaspatishu tasmai d\xc4\x93v\xc4\x81ya nam\xc5\x8dnamah.\n\n[6](sadh03.htm#fr_5) \xc3\x87rinvantu vi\xc3\xa7ve amritasya putr\xc4\x81 \xc4\x81 ye divya dh\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81ni\ntasthuh ved\xc4\x81hametam purusham mah\xc4\x81ntam \xc4\x81ditya var\xc5\x86am tamasah parast\xc4\x81t.\n\n[7](sadh03.htm#fr_6) Ya\xc3\xa7ch\xc4\x81yamasminn\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc3\xa7\xc4\x93 t\xc4\x93j\xc5\x8dmay\xc5\x8d\'mritamayah purushah\nsarv\xc4\x81nubh\xc5\xabh.\n\n[8](sadh03.htm#fr_7) Ya\xc3\xa7ch\xc4\x81yamasminn\xc4\x81tmani t\xc4\x93j\xc5\x8dmay\xc5\x8d\'mritamayah purushah\nsarv\xc4\x81nubh\xc5\xabh.\n\n[9](sadh03.htm#fr_8) Tyakt\xc4\x93na bhu\xc3\xb1j\xc4\xabth\xc4\x81h\n\n[10](sadh03.htm#fr_9) M\xc4\x81 gridhah\n\n[11](sadh03.htm#fr_10) Iha ch\xc4\x93t av\xc4\x93dit atha satyamasti, nach\xc4\x93t iha av\xc4\x93dit\nmahat\xc4\xab vinashtih.\n\n[12](sadh03.htm#fr_11) Bh\xc5\xabt\xc4\x93shu bh\xc5\xabt\xc4\x93shu vichintva.\n\n[13](sadh03.htm#fr_12) Yasya chh\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81mritam yasya mrityuh.\n\n[14](sadh03.htm#fr_13) Pr\xc4\x81no mrityuh.\n\n[15](sadh03.htm#fr_14) Nam\xc5\x8d astu \xc4\x81yat\xc4\x93 nam\xc5\x8d astu par\xc4\x81yat\xc4\x93.
