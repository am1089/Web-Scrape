If it be said that there would result the fault of there being no room for\n(certain) Sm _ri_ tis: (we reply) 'no,' because there would result the fault\nof want of room for other Sm _ri_ tis.\n\nThe first adhyaya has established the truth that what the Vedanta-texts teach\nis a Supreme Brahman, which is something different as well from non-sentient\nmatter known through the ordinary means of proof, viz. Perception and so on,\nas from the intelligent souls whether connected with or separated from matter;\nwhich is free from even a shadow of imperfection of any kind; which is an\nocean as it were of auspicious qualities and so on; which is the sole cause of\nthe entire Universe; which constitutes the inner Self of all things. The\nsecond adhyaya is now begun for the purpose of proving that the view thus set\nforth cannot be impugned by whatever arguments may possibly be brought\nforward. The Sutrakara at first turns against those who maintain that the\nVedanta-texts do not establish the view indicated above, on the ground of that\nview being contradicted by the Sm _ri_ ti of Kapila, i. e. the Sa _n_ khya-\nsystem.\n\nBut how can it be maintained at all that Scripture does not set forth a\ncertain view because thereby it would enter into conflict with Sm _ri_ ti? For\nthat Sm _ri_ ti if contradicted by Scripture is to be held of no account, is\nalready settled in the Purva Mima _m_ sa ('But where there is contradiction Sm\n_ri_ ti is not to be regarded,' I, 3, 3).--Where, we reply, a matter can be\ndefinitely settled on the basis of Scripture--as e.g. in the case of the Vedic\ninjunction, 'he is to sing, after having touched the U _d_ umbara branch'\n(which clearly contradicts the Sm _ri_ ti injunction that the whole branch is\nto be covered up)--Sm _ri_ ti indeed\n\np. 409\n\nneed not be regarded. But the topic with which the Vedanta-texts are concerned\nis hard to understand, and hence, when a conflict arises between those texts\nand a Sm _ri_ ti propounded by some great _Ri_ shi, the matter does not admit\nof immediate decisive settlement: it is not therefore unreasonable to\nundertake to prove by Sm _ri_ ti that Scripture does not set forth a certain\ndoctrine. That is to say--we possess a Sm _ri_ ti composed with a view to\nteach men the nature and means of supreme happiness, by the great _Ri_ shi\nKapila to whom Scripture, Sm _ri_ ti, Itihasa and Pura _n_ a alike refer as a\nperson worthy of all respect (compare e. g. 'the _Ri_ shi Kapila,' _S_ vet.\nUp. V, 2), and who moreover (unlike B _ri_ haspati and other Sm _ri_ ti--\nwriters) fully acknowledges the validity of all the means of earthly happiness\nwhich are set forth in the karmaka _n_ da of the Veda, such as the daily\noblations to the sacred fires, the New and Full Moon offerings and the great\nSoma sacrifices. Now, as men having only an imperfect knowledge of the Veda,\nand moreover naturally slow-minded, can hardly ascertain the sense of the\nVedanta-texts without the assistance of such a Sm _ri_ ti, and as to be\nsatisfied with that sense of the Vedanta which discloses itself on a mere\nsuperficial study of the text would imply the admission that the whole Sa _n_\nkhya Sm _ri_ ti, although composed by an able and trustworthy person, really\nis useless; we see ourselves driven to acknowledge that the doctrine of the\nVedanta-texts cannot differ from the one established by the Sa _n_ khyas. Nor\nmust you object that to do so would force on us another unacceptable\nconclusion, viz. that those Sm _ri_ tis, that of Manu e.g., which maintain\nBrahman to be the universal cause, are destitute of authority; for Manu and\nsimilar works inculcate practical religious duty and thus have at any rate the\nuncontested function of supporting the teaching of the karmaka _n_ da of the\nVeda. The Sa _n_ khya Sm _ri_ ti, on the other hand, is entirely devoted to\nthe setting forth of theoretical truth (not of practical duty), and if it is\nnot accepted in that quality, it is of no use whatsoever.--On this ground the\nSutra sets forth the prima facie view,\n\np. 410\n\n[paragraph continues] 'If it be said that there results the fault of there\nbeing no room for certain Sm _ri_ tis.'\n\nThe same Sutra replies 'no; because there would result the fault of want of\nroom for other Sm _ri_ tis.' For other Sm _ri_ tis, that of Manu e.g., teach\nthat Brahman is the universal cause. Thus Manu says, 'This (world) existed in\nthe shape of darkness, and so on. Then the divine Self existent, indiscernible\nbut making discernible all this, the great elements and the rest, appeared\nwith irresistible power, dispelling the darkness. He, desiring to produce\nbeings of many kinds from his own body, first with a thought created the\nwaters, and placed his seed in them' (Manu I, 5-8). And the Bhagavad-gita, 'I\nam the origin and the dissolution of the whole Universe' (VII, 6). 'I am the\norigin of all; everything proceeds from me' (X, 8). Similarly, in the\nMahabharata, to the question 'Whence was created this whole world with its\nmovable and immovable beings?' the answer is given, 'Naraya _n_ a assumes the\nform of the world, he the infinite, eternal one'; and 'from him there\noriginates the Unevolved consisting of the three gu _n_ as'; and 'the\nUnevolved is merged in the non-acting Person.' And Para _s_ ara says, 'From\nVish _n_ u there sprang the world and in him it abides; he makes this world\npersist and he rules it--he is the world.' Thus also \xc3\x82pastamba, 'The living\nbeings are the dwelling of him who lies in all caves, who is not killed, who\nis spotless'; and 'From him spring all bodies; he is the primary cause, he is\neternal, permanent.' (Dharmasu. I, 8, 22, 4; 23, 2).--If the question as to\nthe meaning of the Vedanta-texts were to be settled by means of Kapila's Sm\n_ri_ ti, we should have to accept the extremely undesirable conclusion that\nall the Sm _ri_ tis quoted are of no authority. It is true that the Vedanta-\ntexts are concerned with theoretical truth lying outside the sphere of\nPerception and the other means of knowledge, and that hence students\npossessing only a limited knowledge of the Veda require some help in order\nfully to make out the meaning of the Vedanta. But what must be avoided in this\ncase is to give any opening for the conclusion that the very numerous\n\np. 411\n\n[paragraph continues] Sm _ri_ tis which closely follow the doctrine of the\nVedanta, are composed by the most competent and trustworthy persons and aim at\nsupporting that doctrine, are irrelevant; and it is for this reason that\nKapila's Sm _ri_ ti which contains a doctrine opposed to Scripture must be\ndisregarded. The support required is elucidation of the sense conveyed by\nScripture, and this clearly cannot be effected by means of a Sm _ri_ ti\ncontradicting Scripture. Nor is it of any avail to plead, as the Purvapakshin\ndoes, that Manu and other Sm _ri_ tis of the same kind fulfil in any case the\nfunction of elucidating the acts of religious duty enjoined in the karmaka _n_\nda. For if they enjoin acts of religious duty as means to win the favour of\nthe Supreme Person but do not impress upon us the idea of that Supreme Person\nhimself who is to be pleased by those acts, they are also not capable of\nimpressing upon us the idea of those acts themselves. That it is the character\nof all religious acts to win the favour of the Supreme Spirit, Sm _ri_ ti\ndistinctly declares, 'Man attains to perfection by worshipping with his proper\naction Him from whom all Beings proceed; and by whom all this is stretched\nout' (Bha. Gi. XVIII, 46); 'Let a man meditate on Naraya _n_ a, the divine\none, at all works, such as bathing and the like; he will then reach the world\nof Brahman and not return hither' (Daksha-sm _ri_ ti); and 'Those men with\nwhom, intent on their duties, thou art pleased, O Lord, they pass beyond all\nthis Maya and find Release for their souls' (Vi. Pu.). Nor can it be said that\nManu and similar Sm _ri_ tis have a function in so far as setting forth works\n(not aiming at final Release but) bringing about certain results included in\ntransmigratory existence, whether here on earth or in a heavenly world; for\nthe essential character of those works also is to please the highest Person.\nAs is said in the Bhagavad-gita (IX, 23, 24); 'Even they who devoted to other\ngods worship them with faith, worship me, against ordinance. For I am the\nenjoyer and the Lord of all sacrifices; but they know me not in truth and\nhence they fall,' and 'Thou art ever worshipped by me with sacrifices; thou\nalone, bearing the form of\n\np. 412\n\npit _ri_ s and of gods, enjoyest all the offerings made to either.' Nor\nfinally can we admit the contention that it is rational to interpret the\nVedanta-texts in accordance with Kapila's Sm _ri_ ti because Kapila, in the\n_S_ veta _s_ vatara text, is referred to as a competent person. For from this\nit would follow that, as B _ri_ haspati is, in _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti,\nmentioned as a pattern of consummate wisdom, Scripture should be interpreted\nin agreement with the openly materialistic and atheistic Sm _ri_ ti composed\nby that authority. But, it may here be said, the Vedanta-texts should after\nall be interpreted in agreement with Kapila's Sm _ri_ ti, for the reason that\nKapila had through the power of his concentrated meditation (yoga) arrived at\nan insight into truth.--To this objection the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
