So I seat myself where we cannot look at each other\'s face. That\nwas how I was sitting the other day when the Bara Rani came and joined us.\n\n"It is all very well for you, brother," said she, "to laugh away these\nthreatening letters. But they do frighten me so. Have you sent off that money\nyou gave me to the Calcutta bank?"\n\n"No, I have not yet had the time to get it away," my husband replied.\n\n"You are so careless, brother dear, you had better look out..."\n\n"But it is in the iron safe right inside the inner dressing- room," said my\nhusband with a reassuring smile.\n\n"What if they get in there? You can never tell!"\n\n"If they go so far, they might as well carry you off too!"\n\n"Don\'t you fear, no one will come for poor me. The real attraction is in your\nroom! But joking apart, don\'t run the risk of keeping money in the room like\nthat."\n\n"They will be taking along the Government revenue to Calcutta in a few days\nnow; I will send this money to the bank under the same escort."\n\n"Very well. But see you don\'t forget all about it, you are so absent-minded."\n\n"Even if that money gets lost, while in my room, the loss cannot be yours,\nSister Rani."\n\n"Now, now, brother, you will make me very angry if you talk in that way. Was I\nmaking any difference between yours and mine? What if your money is lost, does\nnot that hurt me? If Providence has thought fit to take away my all, it has\nnot left me insensible to the value of the most devoted brother known since\nthe days of Lakshman."  25\n\n"Well, Junior Rani, are you turned into a wooden doll? You have not spoken a\nword yet. Do you know, brother, our Junior Rani thinks I try to flatter you.\nIf things came to that pass I should not hesitate to do so, but I know my dear\nold brother does not need it!"\n\nThus the Senior Rani chattered on, not forgetting now and then to draw her\nbrother\'s attention to this or that special delicacy amongst the dishes that\nwere being served. My head was all the time in a whirl. The crisis was fast\ncoming. Something must be done about replacing that money. And as I kept\nasking myself what could be done, and how it was to be done, the unceasing\npatter of my sister-in-law\'s words seemed more and more intolerable.\n\nWhat made it all the worse was, that nothing could escape my sister-in-law\'s\nkeen eyes. Every now and then she was casting side glances towards me. What\nshe could read in my face I do not know, but to me it seemed that everything\nwas written there only too plainly.\n\nThen I did an infinitely rash thing. Affecting an easy, amused laugh I said:\n"All the Senior Rani\'s suspicions, I see, are reserved for me--her fears of\nthieves and robbers are only a feint."\n\nThe Senior Rani smiled mischievously. "You are right, sister mine. A woman\'s\ntheft is the most fatal of all thefts. But how can you elude my watchfulness?\nAm I a man, that you should hoodwink me?"\n\n"If you fear me so," I retorted, "let me keep in your hands all I have, as\nsecurity. If I cause you loss, you can then repay yourself."\n\n"Just listen to her, our simple little Junior Rani!" she laughed back, turning\nto my husband. "Does she not know that there are losses which no security can\nmake good, either in this world or in the next?"\n\nMy husband did not join in our exchange of words. When he had finished, he\nwent off to the outer apartments, for nowadays he does not take his mid-day\nrest in our room.\n\nAll my more valuable jewels were in deposit in the treasury in charge of the\ncashier. Still what I kept with me must have been worth thirty or forty\nthousand. I took my jewel-box to the Bara Rani\'s room and opened it out before\nher, saying: "I leave these with you, sister. They will keep you quite safe\nfrom all worry."\n\nThe Bara Rani made a gesture of mock despair. "You positively astound me,\nChota Rani!" she said. "Do you really suppose I spend sleepless nights for\nfear of being robbed by you?"\n\n"What harm if you did have a wholesome fear of me? Does anybody know anybody\nelse in this world?"\n\n"You want to teach me a lesson by trusting me? No, no! I am bothered enough to\nknow what to do with my own jewels, without keeping watch over yours. Take\nthem away, there\'s a dear, so many prying servants are about."\n\nI went straight from my sister-in-law\'s room to the sitting-room outside, and\nsent for Amulya. With him Sandip came along too. I was in a great hurry, and\nsaid to Sandip: "If you don\'t mind, I want to have a word or two with Amulya.\nWould you..."\n\nSandip smiled a wry smile. "So Amulya and I are separate in your eyes? If you\nhave set about to wean him from me, I must confess I have no power to retain\nhim."\n\nI made no reply, but stood waiting.\n\n"Be it so," Sandip went on. "Finish your special talk with Amulya. But then\nyou must give me a special talk all to myself too, or it will mean a defeat\nfor me. I can stand everything, but not defeat. My share must always be the\nlion\'s share. This has been my constant quarrel with Providence. I will defeat\nthe Dispenser of my fate, but not take defeat at his hands." With a crushing\nlook at Amulya, Sandip walked out of the room.\n\n"Amulya, my own little brother, you must do one thing for me," I said.\n\n"I will stake my life for whatever duty you may lay on me, sister."\n\nI brought out my jewel-box from the folds of my shawl and placed it before\nhim. "Sell or pawn these," I said, "and get me six thousand rupees as fast as\never you can."\n\n"No, no, Sister Rani," said Amulya, touched to the quick. "Let these jewels\nbe. I will get you six thousand all the same."\n\n"Oh, don\'t be silly," I said impatiently. "There is no time for any nonsense.\nTake this box. Get away to Calcutta by the night train. And bring me the money\nby the day after tomorrow positively."\n\nAmulya took a diamond necklace out of the box, held it up to the light and put\nit back gloomily.\n\n"I know," I told him, "that you will never get the proper price for these\ndiamonds, so I am giving you jewels worth about thirty thousand. I don\'t care\nif they all go, but I must have that six thousand without fail."\n\n"Do you know, Sister Rani," said Amulya, "I have had a quarrel with Sandip\nBabu over that six thousand rupees he took from you? I cannot tell you how\nashamed I felt. But Sandip Babu would have it that we must give up even our\nshame for the country. That may be so. But this is somehow different. I do not\nfear to die for the country, to kill for the country--that much _Shakti_ has\nbeen given me. But I cannot forget the shame of having taken money from you.\nThere Sandip Babu is ahead of me. He has no regrets or compunctions. He says\nwe must get rid of the idea that the money belongs to the one in whose box it\nhappens to be-- if we cannot, where is the magic of _Bande Mataram_?"\n\nAmulya gathered enthusiasm as he talked on. He always warms up when he has me\nfor a listener. "The Gita tells us," he continued, "that no one can kill the\nsoul. Killing is a mere word. So also is the taking away of money. Whose is\nthe money? No one has created it. No one can take it away with him when he\ndeparts this life, for it is no part of his soul. Today it is mine, tomorrow\nmy son\'s, the next day his creditor\'s. Since, in fact, money belongs to no\none, why should any blame attach to our patriots if, instead of leaving it for\nsome worthless son, they take it for their own use?"\n\nWhen I hear Sandip\'s words uttered by this boy, I tremble all over. Let those\nwho are snake-charmers play with snakes; if harm comes to them, they are\nprepared for it. But these boys are so innocent, all the world is ready with\nits blessing to protect them. They play with a snake not knowing its nature,\nand when we see them smilingly, trustfully, putting their hands within reach\nof its fangs, then we understand how terribly dangerous the snake is. Sandip\nis right when he suspects that though I, for myself, may be ready to die at\nhis hands, this boy I shall wean from him and save.\n\n"So the money is wanted for the use of your patriots?" I questioned with a\nsmile.\n\n"Of course it is!" said Amulya proudly. "Are they not our kings? Poverty takes\naway from their regal power. Do you know, we always insist on Sandip Babu\ntravelling First Class? He never shirks kingly honours--he accepts them not\nfor himself, but for the glory of us all. The greatest weapon of those who\nrule the world, Sandip Babu has told us, is the hypnotism of their display. To\ntake the vow of poverty would be for them not merely a penance--it would mean\nsuicide."\n\nAt this point Sandip noiselessly entered the room. I threw my shawl over the\njewel-case with a rapid movement.\n\n"The special-talk business not yet over?" he asked with a sneer in his tone.\n\n"Yes, we\'ve quite finished," said Amulya apologetically. "It was nothing\nmuch."\n\n"No, Amulya," I said, "we have not quite finished."\n\n"So exit Sandip for the second time, I suppose?" said Sandip.\n\n"If you please."\n\n"And as to Sandip\'s re-entry .\n\n"Not today. I have no time."\n\n"I see!" said Sandip as his eyes flashed. "No time to waste, only for special\ntalks!"\n\nJealousy! Where the strong man shows weakness, there the weaker sex cannot\nhelp beating her drums of victory. So I repeated firmly: "I really have no\ntime."\n\nSandip went away looking black. Amulya was greatly perturbed. "Sister Rani,"\nhe pleaded, "Sandip Babu is annoyed."\n\n"He has neither cause nor right to be annoyed," I said with some vehemence.\n"Let me caution you about one thing, Amulya. Say nothing to Sandip Babu about\nthe sale of my jewels--on your life."\n\n"No, I will not."\n\n"Then you had better not delay any more. You must get away by tonight\'s\ntrain."\n\nAmulya and I left the room together. As we came out on the verandah Sandip was\nstanding there. I could see he was waiting to waylay Amulya. To prevent that I\nhad to engage him. "What is it you wanted to tell me, Sandip Babu?" I asked.\n\n"I have nothing special to say--mere small talk. And since you have not the\ntime .. "\n\n"I can give you just a little."\n\nBy this time Amulya had left. As we entered the room Sandip asked: "What was\nthat box Amulya carried away?" The box had not escaped his eyes. I remained\nfirm. "If I could have told you, it would have been made over to him in your\npresence!"\n\n"So you think Amulya will not tell me?"\n\n"No, he will not."\n\nSandip could not conceal his anger any longer. You think you will gain the\nmastery over me?" he blazed out. "That shall never be. Amulya, there, would\ndie a happy death if I deigned to trample him under foot. I will never, so\nlong as I live, allow you to bring him to your feet!"\n\nOh, the weak! the weak! At last Sandip has realized that he is weak before me!\nThat is why there is this sudden outburst of anger. He has understood that he\ncannot meet the power that I wield, with mere strength. With a glance I can\ncrumble his strongest fortifications. So he must needs resort to bluster. I\nsimply smiled in contemptuous silence. At last have I come to a level above\nhim. I must never lose this vantage ground; never descend lower again. Amidst\nall my degradation this bit of dignity must remain to me!\n\n"I know," said Sandip, after a pause, "it was your jewel-case."\n\n"You may guess as you please," said I, "but you will get nothing out of me.\n\n"So you trust Amulya more than you trust me? Do you know that the boy is the\nshadow of my shadow, the echo of my echo--that he is nothing if I am not at\nhis side?"\n\n"Where he is not your echo, he is himself, Amulya. And that is where I trust\nhim more than I can trust your echo!"\n\n"You must not forget that you are under a promise to render up all your\nornaments to me for the worship of the Divine Mother. In fact your offering\nhas already been made."\n\n"Whatever ornaments the gods leave to me will be offered up to the gods. But\nhow can I offer those which have been stolen away from me?"\n\n"Look here, it is no use your trying to give me the slip in that fashion. Now\nis the time for grim work. Let that work be finished, then you can make a\ndisplay of your woman\'s wiles to your heart\'s content--and I will help you in\nyour game."\n\nThe moment I had stolen my husband\'s money and paid it to Sandip, the music\nthat was in our relations stopped. Not only did I destroy all my own value by\nmaking myself cheap, but Sandip\'s powers, too, lost scope for their full play.\nYou cannot employ your marksmanship against a thing which is right in your\ngrasp. So Sandip has lost his aspect of the hero; a tone of low\nquarrelsomeness has come into his words.\n\nSandip kept his brilliant eyes fixed full on my face till they seemed to blaze\nwith all the thirst of the mid-day sky. Once or twice he fidgeted with his\nfeet, as though to leave his seat, as if to spring right on me. My whole body\nseemed to swim, my veins throbbed, the hot blood surged up to my ears; I felt\nthat if I remained there, I should never get up at all. With a supreme effort\nI tore myself off the chair, and hastened towards the door.\n\nFrom Sandip\'s dry throat there came a muffled cry: "Whither would you flee,\nQueen?" The next moment he left his seat with a bound to seize hold of me. At\nthe sound of footsteps outside the door, however, he rapidly retreated and\nfell back into his chair. I checked my steps near the bookshelf, where I stood\nstaring at the names of the books.\n\nAs my husband entered the room, Sandip exclaimed: "I say, Nikhil, don\'t you\nkeep Browning among your books here? I was just telling Queen Bee of our\ncollege club. Do you remember that contest of ours over the translation of\nthose lines from Browning? You don\'t?\n\n/* "She should never have looked at me, If she meant I should not love her,\nThere are plenty ... men you call such, I suppose ... she may discover All her\nsoul to, if she pleases, And yet leave much as she found them: But I\'m not so,\nand she knew it When she fixed me, glancing round them. */\n\n"I managed to get together the words to render it into Bengali, somehow, but\nthe result was hardly likely to be a \'joy forever\' to the people of Bengal. I\nreally did think at one time that I was on the verge of becoming a poet, but\nProvidence was kind enough to save me from that disaster. Do you remember old\nDakshina? If he had not become a Salt Inspector, he would have been a poet. I\nremember his rendering to this day ...\n\n"No, Queen Bee, it is no use rummaging those bookshelves. Nikhil has ceased to\nread poetry since his marriage--perhaps he has no further need for it. But I\nsuppose \'the fever fit of poesy\', as the Sanskrit has it, is about to attack\nme again."\n\n"I have come to give you a warning, Sandip," said my husband.\n\n"About the fever fit of poesy?"\n\nMy husband took no notice of this attempt at humour. "For some time," he\ncontinued, "Mahomedan preachers have been about stirring up the local\nMussulmans. They are all wild with you, and may attack you any moment."\n\n"Are you come to advise flight?"\n\n"I have come to give you information, not to offer advice."\n\n"Had these estates been mine, such a warning would have been necessary for the\npreachers, not for me. If, instead of trying to frighten me, you give them a\ntaste of your intimidation, that would be worthier both of you and me. Do you\nknow that your weakness is weakening your neighbouring _zamindars_ also?"\n\n"I did not offer you my advice, Sandip. I wish you, too, would refrain from\ngiving me yours. Besides, it is useless. And there is another thing I want to\ntell you. You and your followers have been secretly worrying and oppressing my\ntenantry. I cannot allow that any longer. So I must ask you to leave my\nterritory."\n\n"For fear of the Mussulmans, or is there any other fear you have to threaten\nme with?"\n\n"There are fears the want of which is cowardice. In the name of those fears, I\ntell you, Sandip, you must go. In five days I shall be starting for Calcutta.\nI want you to accompany me. You may of course stay in my house there--to that\nthere is no objection."\n\n"All right, I have still five days" time then. Meanwhile, Queen Bee, let me\nhum to you my song of parting from your honey-hive. Ah! you poet of modern\nBengal! Throw open your doors and let me plunder your words. The theft is\nreally yours, for it is my song which you have made your own--let the name be\nyours by all means, but the song is mine." With this Sandip struck up in a\ndeep, husky voice, which threatened to be out of tune, a song in the Bhairavi\nmode:\n\n"In the springtime of your kingdom, my Queen,  \nMeetings and partings chase each other in their endless hide and seek,  \nAnd flowers blossom in the wake of those that droop and die in the shade.  \nIn the springtime of your kingdom, my Queen,  \nMy meeting with you had its own songs,  \nBut has not also my leave-taking any gift to offer you?  \nThat gift is my secret hope, which I keep hidden in the shadows of your flower\ngarden,  \nThat the rains of July may sweetly temper your fiery June."\n\nHis boldness was immense--boldness which had no veil, but was naked as fire.\nOne finds no time to stop it: it is like trying to resist a thunderbolt: the\nlightning flashes: it laughs at all resistance.\n\nI left the room. As I was passing along the verandah towards the inner\napartments, Amulya suddenly made his appearance and came and stood before me.\n\n"Fear nothing, Sister Rani," he said. "I am off tonight and shall not return\nunsuccessful."\n\n"Amulya," said I, looking straight into his earnest, youthful face, "I fear\nnothing for myself, but may I never cease to fear for you."\n\nAmulya turned to go, but before he was out of sight I called him back and\nasked: "Have you a mother, Amulya?"\n\n"I have."\n\n"A sister?"\n\n"No, I am the only child of my mother. My father died when I was quite\nlittle."\n\n"Then go back to your mother, Amulya."\n\n"But, Sister Rani, I have now both mother and sister."\n\n"Then, Amulya, before you leave tonight, come and have your dinner here."\n\n"There won\'t be time for that. Let me take some food for the journey,\nconsecrated with your touch."\n\n"What do you specially like, Amulya?" "If I had been with my mother I should\nhave had lots of Poush cakes. Make some for me with your own hands, Sister\nRani!"\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[25](hw37.htm#fr_24) Of the _Ramayana_.
