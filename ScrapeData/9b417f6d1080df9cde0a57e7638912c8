THE BUDDHA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.\n\nThis incarnation of Vishnu is "originally foreign to the cycle of the Avat\xc4\x81ras\nof Vishnu, and therefore is only briefly alluded to in some of Pur\xc4\x81nas. Where\nthis is done, the intention must have been to effect a compromise between\nBr\xc4\x81hmanism and Buddhism, by trying to represent the latter religion as not\nirreconcilably\n\n[![BUDDHA.](tn/22500.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/22500.jpg)  \nBUDDHA.  \n\nantagonistic to the former." * Colonel Kennedy, \xe2\x80\xa0 on the other hand, argues\nthat the Buddha of the Pur\xc4\x81nas and Buddha the founder of the Buddhist system\nof religion have nothing in common but the name, and that the attempted\nidentification of these two is simply\n\np. 226\n\nthe work of European scholars, who have not been sufficiently careful to\ncollect information, and to weigh the evidence they have had before them.\nThere can be\n\n[![BUDDHIST TEMPLE AND DAGOBA AT KELANIYA, CEYLON.](tn/22600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/22600.jpg)  \nBUDDHIST TEMPLE AND DAGOBA AT KELANIYA, CEYLON.  \n\np. 227\n\nlittle doubt that Colonel Kennedy\'s view is untenable. Seeing the bitter\nantagonism that existed between the advocates of the rival systems, it need\noccasion no surprise that full accounts of Buddha are not to be found in\nBr\xc4\x81hmanical books, nor that the meagre accounts that are there should try to\nrepresent him as a despicable character. The Br\xc4\x81hmanical writers were far too\nshrewd to admit that one who exerted such immense influence, and won so many\ndisciples, could be other than an incarnation of deity; but as his teaching\nwas opposed to their own they cleverly say that it was to mislead the enemies\nof the gods that he promulgated his doctrine, that they, becoming weak and\nwicked through error, might be led once again to seek the help and blessing of\nthose whom they had previously neglected.\n\nThe Pur\xc4\x81nic account of Buddha will be given, supplemented by further\nparticulars of his life and work from Buddhist writings.\n\nIn the "Bh\xc4\x81gavata Pur\xc4\x81na" * are only four short passages respecting him. "At\nthe commencement of the K\xc4\x81li-yuga will Vishnu become incarnate in Kikata,\nunder the name of Buddha, the son of Jina, for the purpose of deluding the\nenemies of the gods." "The Undiscernible Being, having assumed a mortal form,\npreached heretical doctrines in the three cities founded by M\xc4\x81ya (and in\nK\xc4\x81si), for the purpose of destroying, by deluding them, the enemies of the\ngods, steadfast in the religion prescribed by the Vedas." "Praise to the pure\nBuddha, the deluder of the Daityas and the D\xc4\x81navas." "By his words, as Buddha,\nVishnu deludes the heretics."\n\nIn the Skanda, \xe2\x80\xa0 the legend, of which the Bh\xc4\x81gavata gives but the merest\noutline, is more fully given. There was a dire famine in the earth, owing to\nthe failure of\n\np. 228\n\nrains for six successive years. On this account Brahm\xc4\x81 in great distress\nvisited a prince named Ripanjaya, and told him that if he would become king,\nthe gods would serve him, and his name should be changed to Divod\xc4\x81sa. On\nasking why he was chosen before all others, Brahm\xc4\x81 tells him, "All other kings\nare wicked, and the gods will not shower rain upon the earth unless you accept\nthe government. Divod\xc4\x81sa accedes to Brahm\xc4\x81\'s request on condition that that\ndeity would assist him and that all the other gods would forsake the earth, so\nthat he might reign without a rival, and be the only one who could confer\nhappiness on men. Brahm\xc4\x81, in fulfilling this condition, with some difficulty\npersuaded Siva to forsake K\xc4\x81si (Benares), his favourite dwelling-place.\n\nDivod\xc4\x81sa fixed his throne at K\xc4\x81si, where for 8000 years he ruled with the\ngreatest benefit to men. The gods becoming jealous of his power went to\nVrihaspati, their preceptor, and, whilst they spoke well of the effects of the\nking\'s government, complained that he, and not the gods, was benefited by it.\nSiva especially was annoyed at his enforced absence from K\xc4\x81si; for although he\nsent several times to make inquiries about its inhabitants, his messengers\nwere too happy on earth to return to their lord in heaven. Vishnu, accompanied\nby Lakshmi and Garuda, at Siva\'s request, "then proceeded to K\xc4\x81si, a little to\nthe north of which he formed by his divine power a pleasant abode named\nDharmakshetra, and there, attended by his lovely spouse, did he reside under\nthe form of Buddha, while Lakshmi became a female recluse of that sect. Garuda\nalso appeared under the name of Panyakirti, as a pupil with a book in his\nhand, and attentively listening to the delusive instructions of his preceptor\n(Buddha), who with a low,\n\np. 229\n\nsweet, and affectionate voice taught him various branches of natural and\nsupernatural religion."\n\nVishnu, as Buddha, taught that "the universe was without a creator; it is\nfalse therefore to assert that there is one universal and Supreme Spirit, for\nBrahm\xc4\x81, Vishnu, Rudra, and the rest are names of mere corporeal beings like\nourselves. Death is a peaceful sleep: why fear it?" He further taught that "we\nshould guard as our own life the life of another; that pleasure is the only\nheaven, and pain the only hell, and liberation from ignorance the sole\nbeatitude. Sacrifices are acts of folly." Through the exertions of Panyakirti,\nthese doctrines soon spread through the city; whilst Lakshmi deluded the women\nby teaching them to "place all happiness in sensual pleasures; as the body\nmust decay, let us, before it becomes dust, enjoy the pleasures which it\ngives. The distinction of castes has been vainly imagined." As Lakshmi gave\nnumerous boons to her disciples, her influence was great, and her teaching\nspread widely.\n\nAs a result of the dissemination of these doctrines in the city, Divod\xc4\x81sa\nbecame dispirited. Vishnu in the form of a Br\xc4\x81hman appeared to him, and hears\nan account of his troubles, and is delighted as he expresses a wish to resign\nhis crown, The king mentions a number of cases in which virtuous men have had\nto suffer, owing to the power of the gods, and inquires how he can obtain\nfinal beatitude. Vishnu informs him that he has acted unwisely in compelling\nSiva to forsake K\xc4\x81si, and advises him to consecrate an image of that god, by\nworshipping which he will obtain the fulfilment of his desires. Divod\xc4\x81sa\nfollows this counsel, inaugurates his son as king, and as he is worshipping\nthe Linga he had set up, Siva appears and conducts him to Kailasa (Siva\'s\nheaven). It is the common belief of the people\n\np. 230\n\nin the west of India, that when Vishnu had effected the apostasy of Divod\xc4\x81sa,\nhe was prevailed upon to terminate the propagation of his heretical opinions,\nand disappeared in a deep well at Gya.\n\nThe following legend from the "Siva Pur\xc4\x81na" * gives another reason for the\nrise of Buddhism. A famous Rishi named Gautama, with his virtuous wife named\nAhaly\xc4\x81, performed during a thousand years a severe _tapas_ (penance) in the\nsouthern country near the mountain Brahm\xc4\x81dri. During this time there was a\nsevere drought, to remove which, Gautama worshipped Varuna for six months with\ngreat fervour, when the deity promised to grant any boon that should be asked.\nGautama asked for rain, but Varuna said, "How can I transgress the divine\ncommand? Ask some boon which it is in my power to grant." Gautama then desired\nVaruna to cause a surpassingly beautiful hermitage to appear, shaded from the\nsun by fragrant and fruit-bearing trees, where holy men and women by\nmeditation shall be liberated from pain, sorrow, and anxiety; "and as thou art\nlord of water, let it enjoy a perennial fountain." Varuna granted this\nrequest, and the hermitage of Gautama became "the loveliest on the terrestrial\norb."\n\nOne day as the disciples of Gautama went to the fountain, some Br\xc4\x81hman women\ntried to prevent them drawing water until they had filled their own pots.\nAhaly\xc4\x81 going herself was subjected daily to the same annoyance: the Br\xc4\x81hman\nwomen would not allow her to draw water before they had themselves obtained\nall they required. These women, not satisfied with annoying the ascetics,\ncomplained to their husbands of the unkind treatment they alleged they had\nreceived from Ahaly\xc4\x81.\n\np. 231\n\n[paragraph continues] Their husbands resorted to Ganesa for advice, who being\npleased with their devotion promised a boon; they asked that Gautama might be\nmade to leave his hermitage without their incurring the sin of driving him\naway. To this Ganesa reluctantly consented; and in order to effect this object\nhe transformed himself into a poor debilitated cow, and walked into a field of\nrice where Gautama was standing, and began to eat the grain. The sage, knowing\nnothing of this disguise, took up a straw and tried to drive the cow away; no\nsooner did he touch it than it fell down dead. Having incurred the enormous\nguilt of killing a cow, the poor man had to leave the neighbourhood.\n\nGautama and his wife removed to a distance; but until he had expiated his sin\nthey could not perform acceptable worship. Gautama seeks the Br\xc4\x81hmans, and\nasking how he can be free from his crime, is told to walk round the mountain\nof Brahm\xc4\x81 a hundred times; bathe in the Ganges, and consecrate and worship ten\nmillion images of Siva. As he is propitiating him, Siva, delighted with the\nman\'s earnestness, appears, informs him of the trick by which Ganesa had\ndriven him from the hermitage, and brings the Ganges so near that he can bathe\nin it easily. Tradition says that Gautama was so disgusted with the conduct of\nthe Br\xc4\x81hmans that he separated himself from their communion, and established a\nnew system of religion, which for a time eclipsed Brahmanism.\n\nThe following extracts, giving an account of Buddha, are from the "Lalita-\nVistara," * a Buddhist work from which M. Barthelemy St. Hilaire has taken the\nmaterials for his work, "La Boudda et sa Religion."\n\n"Buddha, or more correctly The Buddha--for Buddha\n\np. 232\n\nis an appellative, meaning enlightened--was born at Kapilavastu, the capital\nof a kingdom of that name, situated at the foot of the mountains of Nepal,\nnorth of the present Oude. His father, the King of Kapilavastu, was of the\nfamily of the S\xc4\x81kyas, and belonged to the clan of the Gautamas. His mother was\nM\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81devi, daughter of King Suprabuddha, and need we say that she was\nbeautiful, as he was powerful and just? Buddha\n\n[![BUDDHA.](tn/23200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/23200.jpg)  \nBUDDHA.  \n\nwas therefore by birth of the Kshattriya, or warrior caste, and he took the\nname of S\xc4\x81kya from his family, and that of Gautama from his clan, claiming a\nkind of spiritual relationship with the honoured race of Gautamas. The name of\nBuddha, or The Buddha, dates from a latter period of his life, and so probably\ndoes Siddh\xc4\x81rtha (he whose objects have been accomplished), though we are told\nthat it was given him in his childhood.\n\np. 233\n\n[paragraph continues] His mother died seven days after his birth, and the\nfather confided the child to the care of his deceased wife\'s sister, who,\nhowever, had been his wife even before the mother\'s death. The child grew up a\nmost beautiful and most accomplished boy, who soon knew more than his masters\ncould teach him. He refused to take part in the games of his playmates, and\nnever felt so happy as when he could sit alone, lost in meditation in the deep\nshadows of the forest. It was there that his father found him when he had\nthought him lost; and, in order to prevent the young prince from becoming a\ndreamer, the king determined to marry him at once. When the subject was\nmentioned by the aged ministers to the future heir to the throne, he demanded\nseven days for reflection, and, convinced at last that not even marriage could\ndisturb the calm of his mind, he allowed the ministers to look out for a\nprincess. The princess selected was the beautiful Gop\xc4\x81, the daughter of\nDandapani. Though her father objected at first to her marrying a young prince\nwho was represented to him as deficient in manliness and intellect, he gladly\ngave his consent when he saw the royal suitor distancing all his rivals in\nfeats of arms and power of mind. Their marriage proved one of the happiest,\nbut the prince remained, as he had been before, absorbed in meditations on the\nproblems of life and death. \'Nothing is stable on earth,\' he used to say;\n\'nothing is real. Like is like the spark produced by the friction of wood. It\nis lighted and is extinguished--we know not whence it came, or whither it\ngoes. It is like the sound of a lyre, and the wise man asks in vain from\nwhence it came and whither it goes. There must be some supreme intelligence\nwhere we can find rest. If I attained it I could bring light to man; if I were\nfree myself, I could deliver\n\np. 234\n\nthe world.\' The king, who perceived the melancholy mood of the young prince,\ntried everything to divert him from his speculations; but all was in vain.\nThree of the most ordinary events that could happen to any man proved of the\nutmost importance in the career of Buddha.\n\n"One day, when the prince with a large retinue was driving through the Eastern\ngate of the city on the way to one of his parks, he met on the road an old\nman, broken and decrepit. One could see the veins and muscles over the whole\nof his body; his teeth chattered, he was covered with wrinkles, bald, and\nhardly able to utter hollow and unmelodious sounds. He was bent on his stick,\nand all his limbs and joints trembled. \'Who is this man?\' said the prince to\nhis coachman. \'He is small and weak, his flesh and his blood are dried up, his\nmuscles stick to his skin, his teeth chatter, his body is wasted away; leaning\non his stick, he is hardly able to walk, stumbling at every step. Is there\nsomething peculiar in his family, or is this the common lot of all created\nbeings?\'\n\n"\'Sir,\' replied the coachman, \'that man is sinking under old age, his senses\nhave become obscure, suffering has destroyed his strength, and he is despised\nby his relations. He is without support and useless, and people have abandoned\nhim, like a dead tree in a forest. But this is not peculiar to his family. In\nevery creature youth is defeated by old age. Your father, your mother, all\nyour relations, all your friends, will come to the same state: this is the\nappointed end of all creatures.\'\n\n"\'Alas!\' replied the prince, \'are creatures so ignorant, so weak and foolish,\nas to be proud of the youth by which they are intoxicated, not seeing the old\nage which awaits them? As for me, I go away. Coachman, turn\n\np. 235\n\nmy chariot quickly. What am I, the future prey of old age--what have I to do\nwith pleasure? \' and the young prince returned to the city without going to\nthe park.\n\n"Another time the prince was driving through the Southern gate to his\npleasure-garden, when he perceived in the road a man suffering from illness,\nparched with fever, his body wasted, covered with mud, without a friend,\nwithout a home, hardly able to breathe, and frightened at the sight of himself\nand the approach of death. Having questioned his coachman, and received from\nhim the answer which he expected, the young prince said: \'Alas! health is but\nthe sport of a dream, and the fear of suffering must take this frightful form.\nWhere is the wise man, who, after having seen what he is, could any longer\nthink of joy and pleasure?\' The prince turned his chariot, and returned to the\ncity.\n\n"A third time he was driving to his pleasure-garden through the Western gate,\nwhen he saw a dead body on the road, lying on a bier and covered with a cloth.\nThe friends stood about crying, sobbing, tearing their hair, covering their\nheads with dust, striking their breasts, and uttering wild cries. The prince,\nagain calling his coachman to witness this painful scene, exclaimed: \'Oh, woe\nto youth, which must be destroyed by old age! Woe to health, which must be\ndestroyed by so many diseases! Woe to this life, where a man must remain for\nso short a time!\' Then, betraying for the first time his intentions, the young\nprince said, \'Let us turn back; I must think how to accomplish deliverance.\'\n\n"A last meeting put an end to his meditation. He was driving through the\nNorthern gate on the way to his pleasure-gardens, when he saw a mendicant who\nappeared outwardly calm, subdued, looking downwards,\n\np. 236\n\nwearing with an air of dignity his religious vestment and carrying an alms-\nbowl.\n\n"\'Who is this man? \' asked the prince.\n\n"\'Sir,\' replied the coachman, \'this man is one of those who are called\n_bhikshus_ or mendicants. He has renounced all pleasures, all desires, and\nleads a life of austerity. He tries to conquer himself. He has become a\ndevotee. Without passion, without envy, he walks about asking for alms.\'\n\n"\'This is good and well said,\' replied the prince. The life of a devotee has\nalways been praised by the wise. It will be my refuge, and the refuge of all\nother creatures. It will lead us to a real life, to happiness and\nimmortality.\' With these words, the young prince turned his chariot and\nreturned to the city.\n\n"After having declared to his father and his wife his intention of retiring\nfrom the world, Buddha left his palace one night when all the guards that were\nto have watched him were asleep. After travelling the whole night, he gave his\nhorse and his ornaments to his groom, and sent him back to Kapilavastu. \'A\nmonument,\' remarks the author of the \'Lalita-Vistara,\' \'is still to be seen on\nthe spot where the coachman turned back.\' Hiouen Thsang saw the same monument\nat the edge of a large forest; on his road to Kusinagara, a city now in ruins,\nand situated about fifty miles E.S.E. from Gorakpore.\n\n"Buddha first went to Vaisali, and became the pupil of a famous Br\xc4\x81hman, who\nhad gathered round him 300 disciples. Having learnt all that the Br\xc4\x81hman could\nteach him, Buddha went away disappointed. He had not found the road to\nsalvation. He then tried another Br\xc4\x81hman at R\xc4\x81jagriha, the capital of Magadha\nor Behar, who had 700 disciples, and there, too, he looked in vain\n\np. 237\n\nfor the means of deliverance. He left him, followed by five of his fellow-\nstudents, and for six years retired into solitude, near a village named\nUruvilva, subjecting himself to the most severe penances, previous to his\nappearing in the world as a teacher. At the end of this period, however, he\narrived at the conviction that asceticism, far from giving peace of mind and\npreparing the way to salvation, was a snare and a stumbling-block in the way\nof truth. He gave up his exercises, and was at once deserted as an apostate by\nhis five disciples. Left to himself, he now began to elaborate his own system.\nHe had learned that neither the doctrines nor the austerities of the Br\xc4\x81hmans\nwere of any avail for accomplishing the deliverance of man, and for freeing\nhim from the fear of old age, disease, and death. After long meditations and\necstatic visions, he at last imagined that he had arrived at that true\nknowledge which discloses the cause, and thereby destroys the fear, of all the\nchanges inherent in life. It was from the moment when he arrived at this\nknowledge that he claimed the name of Buddha the enlightened. Buddha hesitated\nfor a time whether he should keep his knowledge to himself or communicate it\nto the world. Compassion for the sufferings of man prevailed, and the young\nprince became the founder of a religion which, after more than 2000 years, is\nstill professed by 455,000,000 of human beings.\n\n"The further history of the new teacher is very simple. He proceeded to\nBenares, which at all times has been the principal seat of learning in India,\nand the first converts he made were the five fellow-students who had left him\nwhen he threw off the yoke of the Br\xc4\x81hmanical observances. Many others\nfollowed, but as the Lalita-Vistara \' breaks off at Buddha\'s arrival at\nBenares, we have no further consecutive account of the\n\np. 238\n\nrapid progress of his doctrine. From what we can gather from scattered notices\nin the Buddhist canon, he was invited by the King of Magadha, Bimbis\xc4\x81ra, to\nhis capital, R\xc4\x81jagriha. Many of his lectures are represented as having been\ndelivered at the monastery of Kalavataka, with which the king or some rich\nmerchant had presented him; others on the Vulture Peak, one of the five hills\nwhich surround the ancient capital.\n\n"Three of his most famous disciples--Sariputra, K\xc4\x81ty\xc4\x81yana, and Maudgaly\xc4\x81yana\njoined him during his stay in Magadha, where he enjoyed for many years the\nfriendship of the king. The king was afterwards assassinated by his son\nAj\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81satru, and then we hear of Buddha as settled for a time at Sr\xc4\x81vasti,\nnorth of the Ganges. Most of Buddha\'s lectures were delivered at Sr\xc4\x81vasti, the\ncapital of Kosala, and the King of Kosala himself, Pr\xc4\x81senagit, became a\nconvert to his doctrine. After an absence of twelve years, we are told that\nBuddha visited his father at Kapilavastu, on which occasion he performed\nseveral miracles, and converted all the S\xc4\x81kyas to his faith. His own wife\nbecame one of his followers, and, with his aunt, offer the first instance of\nfemale Buddhist devotees in India.\n\n"We have fuller particulars again of the last days of Buddha\'s life. He had\nattained the good age of threescore years and ten, and had been on a visit to\nR\xc4\x81jagriha, where the king, Aj\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81satru, the former enemy of Buddha and the\nassassin of his own father, had joined the congregation, after making a public\nconfession of his crimes. On his return he was followed by a large number of\ndisciples, and when on the point of crossing the Ganges, he stood on a square\nstone, and, turning his eyes back towards R\xc4\x81jagriha, he said, full of emotion,\n\'This is the last time that I shall see that city.\' He likewise visited\n\np. 239\n\n[paragraph continues] Vaisali, and, after taking leave . of it, he had nearly\nreached the city of Kusin\xc4\x81gara, when his vital strength began to fail. He\nhalted in a forest, and, while sitting under a S\xc4\x81l tree, he gave up the ghost,\nor, as a Buddhist would say, entered into Nirv\xc4\x81na."\n\nThe following verses by Dr. Muir * are a translation of part of the "Lalita-\nVistara," from which the quotations given above were made:--\n\n"On Him\xc4\x81laya\'s lonely steep  \n   There lived of old an holy sage,  \n   Of shrivelled form, and bent with age,  \n Inured to meditation deep.\n\n"He--when great Buddha had been born,  \n   The glory of the S\xc4\x81kya race,  \n   Endowed with every holy grace,  \n To save the suffering world forlorn--\n\n"Beheld strange portents, signs which taught  \n   The wise that that auspicious time  \n   Had witnessed some event sublime,  \n With universal blessing fraught.\n\n"The sky with joyful gods was thronged:  \n   He heard their voice with glad acclaim  \n   Resounding loudly Buddha\'s name,  \n While echoes clear their shouts prolonged.\n\n"The cause exploring, far and wide  \n   The sage\'s vision ranged; with awe,  \n   Within a cradle laid, he saw  \n Far off the babe, the Sakyas\' pride.\n\n"With longing seized this child to view  \n   At hand, and clasp, and homage pay,  \n   Athwart the sky he took his way  \n By magic art, and swan-like flew;\n\np. 240\n\n"And came to King Suddh\xc5\x8ddan\'s gates;  \n   And entrance craved--\'Go, royal page,  \n   And tell thy lord an ancient sage  \n To see the king permission waits.\'\n\n"The page obeyed, and joined his hands  \n   Before the prince, and said, \'A sage  \n   Of shrivelled form, and bowed with age,  \n Before the gate, my sovereign, stands,\n\n"\'And humbly asks to see the king.\'  \n   To whom Suddh\xc5\x8ddan cried, \'We greet  \n   All such with joy; with honour meet  \n The holy man before us bring!\'\n\n"The saint beside the monarch stood,  \n   And spake his blessing--\'Thine be health,  \n   With length of life, and might, and wealth;  \n And ever seek thy people\'s good.\'\n\n"With all due forms and meet respect  \n   The king received the holy man  \n   And bade him sit; and then began--  \n \'Great sage, I do not recollect\n\n"\'That I thy venerable face  \n   Have ever seen before; allow  \n   That I inquire what brings thee now  \n From thy far distant dwelling-place.\'\n\n"\'To see thy babe,\' the saint replies,  \n   \'I come from Him\xc4\x81laya\'s steeps.\'  \n   The king rejoins, \'My infant sleeps;  \n A moment wait until he rise.\'\n\n"\'Such great ones ne\'er,\' the Rishi spike,  \n   In torpor long their senses steep,  \n   Nor softly love luxurious sleep;  \n The infant prince will soon awake.\'\n\n"The wondrous child, alert to rise,  \n   At will his slumbers light dispelled.  \n   His father\'s arms the infant held  \n Before the sage\'s longing eyes.\n\np. 241\n\n"The babe beholding, passing bright,  \n   More glorious than the race divine,  \n   And marked with every noble sign,  \n The saint was whelmed with deep delight;\n\n"And crying, \'Lo! an infant graced  \n   With every charm of form I greet!\'  \n   He fell before the Buddha\'s feet,  \n With fingers joined, and round him paced.\n\n"Next round the babe his arms he wound,  \n   And \'One,\' he said, \'of two careers  \n   Of fame awaits in coming years  \n The child in whom these signs are found.\n\n"\'If such an one at home abide,  \n   He shall become a king, whose sway  \n   Supreme a mighty armed array  \n On earth shall \'stablish far and wide.\n\n"\'If, spurning worldly pomp as vain,  \n   He choose to lead a tranquil life,  \n   And wander forth from home and wife,  \n He then a Buddha\'s rank shall gain.\'\n\n"He spoke, and on the infant gazed,  \n   When tears suffused his aged eyes;  \n   His bosom heaved with heavy sighs;  \n Then King Suddh\xc5\x8ddan asked, amazed--\n\n"\'Say, holy man, what makes thee weep  \n   And deeply sigh? Does any fate  \n   Malign the child await?  \n May heavenly powers my infant keep!\n\n"\'For thy fair infant\'s weal no fears  \n   Disturb me, king,\' the Rishi cried;  \n   \'No ill can such a child betide;  \n My own sad lot commands my tears.\n\n"\'In every grace complete, thy son  \n   Of truth shall perfect insight gain,  \n   And far sublimer fame attain  \n Than ever lawgiver has won.\n\np. 242\n\n"\'He such a wheel of sacred lore  \n   Shall speed on earth to roll, as yet  \n   Hath never been in motion set  \n By priest, or sage, or god of yore.\n\n"\'The world of men and gods to bless,  \n   The way of rest and peace to teach,  \n   A holy law thy son shall preach--  \n A law of stainless righteousness.\n\n"\'By him shall suffering men be freed  \n   From weakness, sickness, pain, and grief;  \n   From all the ills shall find relief  \n Which hatred, love, illusion breed.\n\n"\'His hands shall loose the chains of all  \n   Who groan in earthly bonds confined;  \n   With healing touch the wounds shall bind  \n Of those whom pain\'s sharp arrows gall.\n\n"\'His words of power shall put to flight  \n   The dull array of leaden clouds  \n   Which helpless mortals\' vision shrouds,  \n And clear their intellectual sight.\n\n"\'By him shall men, who, now untaught,  \n   In devious paths of error stray,  \n   Be led to find a perfect way--  \n To final calm at last be brought.\n\n"\'But once, O king, in many years,  \n   The fig-tree somewhere flowers, perhaps;  \n   So, after countless ages lapse,  \n A Buddha once on earth appears.\n\n"\'And now, at length, this blessed time  \n   Has come: for he, who cradled lies  \n   An infant there before thine eyes,  \n Shall be a Buddha in his prime.\n\n"\'Full, perfect insight gaining, he  \n   Shall rescue endless myriads tost  \n   On life\'s rough ocean waves, and lost,  \n And grant them immortality.\n\np. 243\n\n"\'But I am old, and frail, and worn;  \n   I shall not live the day to see  \n   When this thy wondrous child shall free  \n From woe the suffering world forlorn.\n\n"\'\'Tis thus mine own unhappy fate  \n   Which bids me mourn, and weep, and sigh;  \n   The Buddha\'s triumph now is nigh,  \n But, ah! for me it comes too late!\'\n\n"When thus this aged saint, inspired,  \n   Had all the infant\'s greatness told,  \n   The king his wondrous son extolled,  \n And sang, with pious ardour fired--\n\n"\'Thee, child, th\' immortals worship all,  \n   The great Physician, born to cure  \n   All ills that hapless men endure;  \n I, too, before thee prostrate fall!\'\n\n"And now--his errand done--the sage,  \n   Dismissed with gifts and human due,  \n   Athwart the ether swanlike flew,  \n And reached again his hermitage."\n\nBuddhism, the system of religion taught by Buddha, starts with the doctrine\ncommon to it and Hinduism of transmigration. * It then goes on to say that\npain and\n\np. 244\n\npleasure are simply the result of Karma (works), no notice whatever being\ntaken of the existence or nonexistence of God. It assumes that existence is\nand must be miserable; and that the highest conceivable good is to obtain\nentire exemption from existence. Death does not necessarily bring this\nexemption; it may be but an entrance into a worse form of it than is at\npresent endured. Buddha\'s four " Sublime verities," containing the germ of his\nsystem, are as follows:--The first is that pain exists; the second, that\ndesire is the cause of pain; the third, that pain can be ended by Nirv\xc4\x81na, or\nexemption from existence, practical annihilation; the fourth shows the way\nthat leads to Nirv\xc4\x81na. The great thing is to get rid of desire, and when this\nis accomplished, the soul is ready for complete Nirv\xc4\x81na, and a man dying in\nthis state will not again be born. He taught the evil of caste distinctions,\nand all who embraced his tenets became members of a great brotherhood. Instead\nof the painful mortifications and costly sacrifices by which the Hindus were\ncompelled to make expiation for sin, he taught that confession and promise of\namendment were all that was necessary. Its moral code is one of the most\nperfect in the world: the spring of all virtue is Maitri, which can only be\ntranslated as charity or love. "It does not express friendship, or the feeling\nof particular affection which a man has for one or more of his fellow-\ncreatures, but that universal feeling which inspires us with good-will towards\nall men and constant willingness to help them." *\n\nThere is one peculiarity of the followers of Buddha as compared with the\nHindus, viz. the preservation of and veneration for relics of their founder.\nWith the exception of a legend stating that Krishna\'s bones were\n\np. 245\n\nplaced in the image of Jagann\xc4\x81th, and another teaching that Vishnu cut the\ndead body of Sati into fifty-one parts, each of which is now enshrined in a\ntemple, we have no record of relics being preserved by the Hindus. But the\nBuddhists profess to have carefully preserved parts of their great leader, and\nenshrine them in Dagobas. One of the most celebrated of these is represented\non page 226. A tooth of Buddha is believed to be kept in it; in others a\nsingle hair is most religiously guarded. These Dagobas are not temples, though\nin some cases they form part of buildings that are, or have been, used for\nworship.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[225:*](hmvp28.htm#fr_217) Goldstucker, Chambers\'s Cyclopaedia.\n\n[225:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp28.htm#fr_218) "Hindu Mythology," p. 248.\n\n[227:*](hmvp28.htm#fr_219) Kennedy, "Hindu Mythology," p. 250.\n\n[227:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp28.htm#fr_220) Ibid., p. 423.\n\n[230:*](hmvp28.htm#fr_221) Kennedy, "Hindu Mythology," p. 253.\n\n[231:*](hmvp28.htm#fr_222) Max-Muller, "Chips," vol. i. p. 210 ff.\n\n[239:*](hmvp28.htm#fr_223) O.

T., ii. 496.\n\n[243:*](hmvp28.htm#fr_224) In Hinduism it is the transmigration of souls from\nthe lowest to the highest scale, until they become fit for absorption into the\nDivine from whence they came. At its close each life is carefully judged, and\nwhen next the person returns to the earth he is born in a higher stage if good\npreponderated; in a lower if the evil turned the scale. In Buddhism, which\ndenies the existence of souls, the transmigration is somewhat different in\nform. As soon as a person dies a new being is produced in a more or less\nmiserable condition, according to the "Karma," the sum total of the good or\nevil in all its many previous lives. Practically there is no great difference\nbetween these views. For though the Hindu believes that the same soul passes\nthrough countless changes in successive lives, there is no memory of previous\nexperience, so that each life is separate and distinct from what went before.\nIt is a formal rather than a real difference.\n\n[244:*](hmvp28.htm#fr_225) Burnouf, quoted by Max-Muller, "Chips," i. 222.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10.
