X\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\nThe editor has made no changes in the antiquated form of spelling Anglicized\nSanskrit words used by Thoreau. In his own discussion the modern form is\nfollowed.\n\np. XI\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\nTHE fascination which the Orientals possessed for Thoreau is perfectly evident\nto the reader who skipped no pages in _Walden_ and the _Week_. The sacred\nscriptures of the East held his attention through all his creative years, and\ntheir effect on his work is so patent that even those who have no eye for\ninner significance have noticed how interfused is his prose with imported\nquotations and figures. F. B. Sanborn writes in his biography of Thoreau that\nit was Emerson who first introduced him to the Orientals. The date is recorded\nas 1837. Thoreau\'s _Journals_ indicate that in August, 1838, he had been\nreading the Persian _Zendavesta_ and Confucius, a fact which corroborates\nSanborn. But the extravagant outpouring of praise for the Orientals does not\nfully commence until 1841. Between 1841 and 1843, it will be remembered,\nThoreau lived with the Emersons and assisted his elder friend in the household\ntasks. There can be no doubt that he made free use of the library. The\n_Journals_ for these years tell eloquently of the impression made by Emerson\'s\nOriental books. After reading _The Laws of Menu_ , he writes, "They are the\nlaws of you and me, a fragrance wafted down from those old times, and no more\nto be refuted than the wind . . . I remember the book as an hour before\nsunrise." And in another instance he confides, "I cannot read a sentence in\nthe book of the Hindoos without being elevated as upon the table land of the\nGhauts."\n\np. X\n\nThere was no diminution in Thoreau\'s ardor for these mysterious books through\nthe rest of his life. The joy he found in them during his last years was even\ngreater than that of his first youthful discovery. The most important story\nconnected with this Oriental interest\xc2\x97that of the Cholmondeley\ncollection\xc2\x97should be better known. Because of its immediate importance it may\nbe related here.\n\nIn September, 1854, Thomas Cholmondeley, a friend of Arthur Hugh Clough at\nOxford, came to Concord with letters which introduced him to Emerson. He\nwished to remain in Concord for a short period, but the Emersons were not able\nto accommodate him and he was sent to Mrs. John Thoreau, who took lodgers. The\nyoung Englishman was warmly welcomed by Thoreau\'s mother and an intimate\nfriendship arose between the men. The visit was only too short. It was the\ntime of the Crimean War; Cholmondeley went home to enlist. Just before sailing\nwith his regiment he sent the following letter to his Concord friend:\n\n_October_ 3, 1855.\n\n_My dear_ THOREAU\xc2\x97  \nI have been busily collecting a nest of Indian books for you, which,\naccompanied by this note Mr. Chapman will send you, and you will find them at\nBoston, carriage prepaid (mind that, and don\'t let them cheat you), at Crosby\nand Nichols! I hope, dear Thoreau, you will accept this trifle from one who\nhas received so much from you, and one who\n\np. XIII\n\nis anxious to become your friend and induce you to visit England. I am just\nabout to start for the Crimea, being a complete soldier; but I fear the game\nis nearly played, and all my friends tell me I am just too late for the fair.\nWhen I return to England, (if ever I do return) I mean to buy a little cottage\non the south coast, where I can dwell in _Emersonian leisure_ and where I have\na plot to persuade you over.\n\n*     *     * ****\n\nAdieu, dear Thoreau, and immense affluence to you.\n\n_Ever yours_ ,  \nTHOS. CHOLMONDELEY  \n\nSanborn records that the books arrived in Concord on November 3o, 1855, when\nhe saw them, in the attic chamber where Thoreau kept his small library, in\ncases made by his own hands, not failing to mention that upon receiving the\nfirst announcement of their coming Thoreau had "fashioned for these treasures\na new case, out of drift wood that he had brought home in his voyages along\nthe Musketaquid, thus giving Oriental wisdom an Occidental shrine."\n\nOn December 9, 1855, writing to his friend H. G. O. Blake, Thoreau described\nthe books in brief:\n\nI have arranged my books in a case which I made in the meanwhile, partly of\nriver boards. I have not dipped far into the new ones yet. One is splendidly\nbound and illuminated.\n\np. XIV\n\n[paragraph continues] They are in English, French, Latin, Greek and Sanskrit.\nI have not made out the significance of this godsend yet.\n\nBut by Christmas he had made out the significance of his godsend, for on that\nday he wrote to the Quaker Daniel Ricketson of New Bedford that he had\nreceived\n\na royal gift in the shape of twenty-one distinct works (one in nine\nvolumes\xc2\x97forty-four volumes in all) almost exclusively relating to Hindoo\nliterature and scarcely one of them to be bought in America. I am familiar\nwith many of them and know how to prize them. I send you this information as I\nmight of the birth of a child.\n\nThese books Thoreau cherished until the day of his death. After his decease,\nthey passed into the hands of his friends\xc2\x97principally Emerson and Alcott.\n\n\xc2\x97 II \xc2\x97\n\nIN the Widener Memorial Collection at the Harvard College Library is a large\nsheaf of miscellaneous manuscript pages in Thoreau\'s handwriting. There is\nneither beginning nor end to this material; it is a disorganized mass that\nwould require much labor to collate. One gathers the impression that at one\ntime these pages lay unprotected from a sudden gust of wind which entered the\nroom and scattered them into confusion, only to be subsequently picked up\nhaphazardly by a person utterly ignorant\n\np. XV\n\nof their worth. In this material I found the manuscript of Thoreau\'s _The\nTransmigration of the Seven Brahmans_ , kept intact by a pin which had been\ninserted in the margin.\n\nThe story is a translation from Langlois\'s French rendering of the _Harivansa_\n, a scholarly work of forbidding appearance that few men with only a\nsuperficial interest in Oriental legend and metaphysics would have tackled.\nThe source was discovered solely through the labor of following all the dews\nthe manuscript offered, and searching through every likely volume of Oriental\nliterature to which I had access. There is no mention, so far as I am aware,\nof Langlois, the French Orientalist, in the works of any of the Concord\nwriters. All dews as to the nature of the story were necessarily sought in\ninternal evidence. The spelling of the Hindu proper names was in the French\nmanner. This indicated that the source from which Thoreau procured these names\nwas French. The second clew was the name _Bharata_ , which indicated that the\nstory was most likely allied in some way to the great Indian epic, the\n_Mahabharata_. The frequent and careful insertion of interlinear corrections\nby Thoreau, which can be readily discerned in the original long-hand draft of\nthe story, leads to the question whether it might not have been an original\ncomposition. The content and the technical use of Sanskrit names, however,\ncould scarcely have come from one uninitiated in the original language, unless\nhe had undertaken laborious research in the work of European Orientalists. But\nThoreau was a singular man and his manuscript baffled even\n\np. XVI\n\nseveral Orientalists whom I consulted. I cannot deny that I hoped to prove it\nan original composition, solely for the valuable evidence it would have given\nof the Oriental tang in his mind. But the discovery that the story was a\ntranslation from the French, on second thought rather adds to its value. It is\nthe first extensive evidence I have seen of Thoreau\'s proficiency in French.\nAnd its Oriental value, particularly as evidence of his interest in an\nextensive system of Hindu ascetic practice\xc2\x97the Yoga\xc2\x97becomes the more\nsignificant in view of the confession he made to Blake of the true purpose of\nhis life. The Walden years, also, may be viewed from another angle, for\nalthough Thoreau made his translation in 1849 or 185o, when he drew on the\nHarvard College Library for many Oriental volumes, among them being the\n_Harivansa_ , he had long known of the Yoga way.\n\n\xc2\x97 III \xc2\x97\n\nI FEEL. sure that Thoreau brought himself to the task of translating _The\nTransmigration of the Seven Brahmans_ more because of the Yoga philosophy\nwhich it contained than because of the story itself, interesting as that is. I\nhave already suggested that it throws new light on the Walden episode of his\nlife. Various theories have been advanced to explain his living in a hermit\'s\nsolitude for over two years. Some have argued that it was disappointed love;\nothers have advanced the theory that Walden was a retreat from the smoke and\nnoise of an encroaching industrialism. Again one hears that he bore a grudge\nagainst society and\n\np. XVII\n\nwithdrew, like a snail, into his shell; also, that he was an incarnation of\nanother Rousseau, calling "Simplify! Simplify! Back to nature!" to his\ngeneration. I have no desire to cross swords with the defenders of these\nexplanations. There may be truth in them all. I would, however, advance\nanother theory of the reason Thoreau went to Walden and it is this: the\nretreat was a very natural gesture on the part of a man who was\ntemperamentally an ascetic, particularly one so imbued with Orientalism. He\nwas at all times conscious of an affinity between his own conduct and that of\na Yogi.\n\nIn the correspondence between Thoreau and H. G. O. Blake appear these\nsurprising words from the former\'s pen:\n\nDepend upon it that, rude and careless as I am, I would fain practice the\n_yoga_ faithfully . . . \'The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, contributes in\nhis degree to creation: he breathes a divine perfume, he hears wonderful\nthings. Divine forms traverse him without tearing him, and, united to the\nnature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts as animating original matter.\'\nTo some extent, and at rare intervals _even I am a yogi_.\n\nThe italics are mine. They indicate a confession that cannot be ignored. But\nthere is another self-revealing passage in the _Journals:_\n\nOne may discover the root of a Hindoo religion in his own private history,\nwhen, in the silent intervals of the day or\n\np. XVIII\n\nnight, he does sometimes inflict on himself like austerities with a stern\nsatisfaction.\n\nAmericans will probably be chary of admitting that a Concord Yankee,\nparticularly a Yankee of Thoreau\'s independence and crispness, could in any\nway be a Yogi. With justice they may well ask, "What\'s in a name?" and argue\nthat if Thoreau had written, "I would fain be a Hottentot," there would have\nbeen no more possibility of a change in the essential man and a realization of\nhis aim. Thoreau belonged to the New England scene. In an Oriental shrine he\nwould have been utterly incongruous. Such a contention is irrefutable. But\nthere is the man\'s intellectual cosmopolitanism that must be taken into\nconsideration. Moncure Conway, who knew both Thoreau and the Orientals writes\nthus in his volume _Emerson At Home and Abroad:_\n\nLike the pious Yogi, so long motionless whilst gazing on the sun that knotty\nplants encircled his neck and the cast snakeskin his loins, and the birds\nbuilt their nests on his shoulders, this poet and naturalist, by equal\nconsecration became a part of the field and the forest. . . .\n\n[paragraph continues] Conway was writing specifically of his friend at Walden.\nThe word of a contemporary observer bears out Thoreau\'s confession.\n\nI have already indicated, however briefly, the spirit in which Thoreau read\nthe Orientals. To appreciate his cosmopolitanism, one needs only to be\nreminded that he lived during, and was an\n\np. XIX\n\nactive figure in, the New England Renaissance, that period of intellectual\nfermentation commonly called the Transcendental Period. Concord combed the\nworld for books during those decades. The Brahmans of this Massachusetts\nvillage knew intimately the currents in the thought-life of their time. So I,\nfor one, cannot see the rustic and uninitiated Yankee in Thoreau. He wrote of\nthat which he knew intimately when he wrote of the Yogi. When he applied the\nname to himself it may have been in a transient, whimsical mood; but in that\ncase I find difficulty in understanding the following description of the\nmanner in which he spent a day at the Walden hut:\n\nSometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in my\nsunny doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in revery, amidst the pines and\nhickories and sumachs, while the birds sang around or flitted noiseless\nthrough the house, until by the sun falling in at my west window, or the noise\nof some traveller\'s wagon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse\nof time. I grew in those seasons like corn in the night, and they were far\nbetter than any work of the hands would have been. They were not time\nsubtracted from my life, but so much over and above my usual allowance. _I\nrealized what the Orientals mean by contemplation and the forsaking of works_.\n\nThere is a shadowy line between the things men sincerely believe and the\nthings they use for artistic purposes. No one can\n\np. XX\n\ntrace that line distinctly. The words of Thoreau which I have quoted\xc2\x97and many\nothers which may be had for the searching \xc2\x97lead me to the conviction that his\nPuritan heritage and inherent sanity enabled him to strip the Yoga practice of\nall the superstition and inhuman self-torture native in India. He had no\ninterest in the contemplation of the navel, the drawing of thread through the\nnostrils, the repetition of magic words, the bed of nails, and all the devices\nof hypnotism. He was profoundly interested in the means of finding the One\nBottom of the universe. A mystic, he sensed his affinity with the sincere\nYogi. But his home was Concord, Massachusetts, so instead of taking to the\nbegging-bowl and the road, like his Hindu brethren, he chose Walden. I cannot\nbut believe that as he translated the story which comprises this book, he\nthought of the waters of Walden in some ways as the waters of Manassa, where\nthe seven Brahman brothers sought deliverance.\n\nA.
