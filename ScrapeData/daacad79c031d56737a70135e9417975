That which is not within change; for thus Scripture declares the abiding\n(of the soul).\n\nThat which is not within change, i.e. the highest Brahman which is free from\nall change and of an absolutely perfect and blessed nature--this, together\nwith the manifestations of its glory, is what forms the object of\nconsciousness for the released soul. The worlds which are subject to change\nthus form objects for that soul's experience, in so far as they form part of\nBrahman's manifestation. For Scripture declares that the released soul thus\nabides within, i.e. is conscious of the changeless highest Brahman, 'when he\nfinds freedom from fear and an abode in that which is invisible, incorporeal,\nundefined, unsupported, then he obtains the fearless' (Taitt. Up. II, 7). And\nthat the world is contained within Brahman as its manifestation is declared in\nthe text, 'In that all the worlds abide, and no one goes beyond' (Ka. Up. II,\n5, 8). The meaning of the text stating that the Released freely move in all\nworlds, and similar texts, therefore is only that the released soul while\nconscious of Brahman with its manifestations experiences also the enjoyments,\nlying within the sphere of change, which abide in the world of Hira _n_\nyagarbha and similar beings; not that it possesses the world-energies--\ncreative, ruling, and so on--which are the distinctive attribute of the\nhighest Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 20.
