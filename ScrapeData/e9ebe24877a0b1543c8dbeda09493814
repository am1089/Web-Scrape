The person within (the eye) (is Brahman) on account of the agreement (of\nthe attributes of that person with the nature of Brahman).\n\np. 124\n\nScripture says, 'He spoke: The person that is seen in the eye that is the\nSelf. This is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman. Even though they\ndrop melted butter or water on it (the eye) it runs away on both sides,' &c. (\n_Kh_. Up. IV, 15, 1).\n\nThe doubt here arises whether this passage refers to the reflected Self which\nresides in the eye, or to the individual Self, or to the Self of some deity\nwhich presides over the sense of sight, or to the Lord.\n\nWith reference to this doubt the purvapakshin argues as follows: What is meant\n(by the person in the eye) is the reflected Self, i.e. the image of a person\n(reflected in the eye of another): for of that it is well known that it is\nseen, and the clause, 'The person that is seen in the eye,' refers to it as\nsomething well known. Or else we may appropriately take the passage as\nreferring to the individual Self. For the individual Self (cognitional Self,\nvi _g \xc3\xb1_anatman) which perceives the colours by means of the eye is, on that\naccount, in proximity to the eye; and, moreover, the word 'Self' (which occurs\nin the passage) favours this interpretation. Or else the passage is to be\nunderstood as referring to the soul animating the sun which assists the sense\nof sight; compare the passage (B _ri_. Up. V, 5, 2), 'He (the person in the\nsun) rests with his rays in him (the person in the right eye).' Moreover,\nqualities such as immortality and the like (which are ascribed to the subject\nof the scriptural passage) may somehow belong to individual deities. The Lord,\non the other hand 1, cannot be meant, because a particular locality is spoken\nof.\n\nAgainst this we remark that the highest Lord only can be meant here by the\nperson within the eye.--Why?--'On account of the agreement.' For the qualities\nmentioned in the passage accord with the nature of the highest Lord. The\nquality of being the Self, in the first place, belongs to the highest Lord in\nits primary (non-figurative or non-derived) sense, as we know from such texts\nas 'That\n\np. 125\n\nis the Self,' 'That art thou.' Immortality and fearlessness again are often\nascribed to him in Scripture. The location in the eye also is in consonance\nwith the nature of the highest Lord. For just as the highest Lord whom\nScripture declares to be free from all evil is not stained by any\nimperfections, so the station of the eye also is declared to be free from all\nstain, as we see from the passage, 'Even though they drop melted butter or\nwater on it it runs away on both sides.' The statement, moreover, that he\npossesses the qualities of sa _m_ yadvama, &c. can be reconciled with the\nhighest Lord only ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 15, 2, 'They call him Sa _m_ yadvama, for\nall blessings (vama) go towards him (sa _m_ yanti). He is also vamani, for he\nleads (nayati) all blessings (vama). He is also Bhamani, for he shines (bhati)\nin all worlds'). Therefore, on account of agreement, the person within the eye\nis the highest Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[124:1](sbe34050.htm#fr_148) Who, somebody might say, is to be understood\nhere, because immortality and similar qualities belong to him not somehow\nonly, but in their true sense.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 14](sbe34051.htm)\n\n"
