The names of ascetic and hermit for the third and\nfourth stages are of course approximate renderings only; not having the thing,\nwe have not got the name. But the chief difference between the two seems to be\nthat in the third stage the Brahman still keeps to his dwelling in the forest\noutside his village, and may even be accompanied there by his wife, see his\nchildren, and keep up his sacred\n\np. 4\n\nfires, performing all the time certain exercises, as enjoined in their sacred\nbooks, while in the last stage a man is released from all restrictions, and\nhas to live alone and without any fixed abode 1. Some translators have used\nhermit for the third, and ascetic for the fourth stage. In Sanskrit also there\nexists a variety of names for these two stages, but the distinctive character\nof each is clear, the third stage representing a mere retreat from the world,\nthe fourth a complete surrender of all worldly interests, a cessation of all\nduties, a sundering of all the fetters of passion and desire, and a life\nwithout a fixed abode. The modern Mahatmans should therefore be considered as\nbelonging partly to the third, partly to the fourth or last stage. They are\nwhat we should call friars or itinerant mendicants, for it is their\nacknowledged privilege to beg and to live on charity.\n\nAnother name of these Sa _m_ nyasins was Avadhuta, literally one who has\nshaken off all attachments, while in the language of the common people they\nare often called simply Sadhus, or good men.\n\nIt has sometimes been denied that there are any Sa _m_ nyasins left in India,\nand in one sense this is true. The whole scheme of life, with its four stages,\nas traced in the Laws of Manu, seems to have been at all times more or less of\nan ideal scheme, a plan of life such as, according to the aspirations of the\nBrahmans, it ought to be, but as, taking human nature as it is, it could\nhardly ever have been all over India. Anyhow, at present, though\n\np. 5\n\nthere are men in India who call themselves Sa _m_ nyasins, and are called\nSadhus by the people, they are no longer what Manu meant them to be. They no\nlonger pass through the severe discipline of their studentship, they need no\nlonger have fulfilled all the public and private duties of a married\nhouseholder, nor have remained for a number of years in the seclusion of their\nforest dwelling. They seem free at any time of their life to throw off all\nrestraints, if need be, their very clothing, and begin to preach and teach\nwhenever and wherever they can find people willing to listen to them.\n\nThat the rules laid down in Manu's Law-book had often been broken in early\ntimes, we learn from the existence of a whole class of people called Vratyas.\nAs far back as the Brahma _n_ a period we read of these Vratyas, outcasts who\nhad not practised brahma _k_ arya, proper studentship 1, but who, if they\nwould only perform certain sacrifices, might be readmitted to all the\nprivileges of the three upper castes. That these Vratyas were originally non-\nAryan people is a mere assertion that has often been repeated, but never been\nproved. The name was technically applied, during the Brahma _n_ a period, to\nAryan people who had belonged to a certain caste, but who had forfeited their\ncaste-privileges by their own neglect of the duties pertaining to the first\nstage, brahma _k_ arya. There were actually three classes of them, according\nas the forfeiture affected them personally or dated from their parents or\ngrandparents. All the three classes could be readmitted\n\np. 6\n\nafter performing certain sacrifices. In the modern language vratya has come to\nmean no more than naughty or unmanageable.\n\nIt is curious to observe how the Buddhist revolt was mainly based on the\nargument that if emancipation or spiritual freedom, as enjoyed in the third,\nand more particularly in the fourth stage, was the highest goal of our life on\nearth, it was a mistake to wait for it till the very end of life. The\nBuddhists were in one sense Vratyas who declined to pass through the long and\ntedious discipline of a pupil, who considered the performance of the duties of\na householder, including marriage and endless sacrifices, not only as\nunprofitable, but as mischievous. Buddha himself had declared against the\npenances prescribed for the Brahmanic ascetic as a hindrance rather than as a\nhelp to those who wished for perfect freedom, freedom from all passions and\ndesires, and from the many prejudices of Brahmanic society. It seems almost as\nif the early Buddhists, by adopting the name of Bhikshu, mendicant, for the\nmembers of their order (Sa _m_ gha), had wished to show that they were all Sa\n_m_ nyasins, carrying out the old Brahmanic principles to their natural\nconclusion, though they had renounced at the same time the Vedas, the Laws of\ntradition, and all Brahmanic sacrifices as mere vanity and vexation of spirit.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[3:1](rls04.htm#fr_0) Manu VI, 87.\n\n[4:1](rls04.htm#fr_1) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 9, 22, 21, &c.\n\n[5:1](rls04.htm#fr_2) Journ.
