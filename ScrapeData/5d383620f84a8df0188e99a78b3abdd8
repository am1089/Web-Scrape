Now, when the gods were passing upwards to the world of heaven,\nthe Asuras enveloped them in darkness. They spake, \'Verily, by nothing else\nsave a sacrificial session is there any way of dispelling this (darkness):\nwell, then, let us perform a sacrificial session!\'\n\n11:5:5:22\\. They entered upon a sacrificial session of a hundred Agnish _t_\noma (days), and dispelled the darkness as far as one may see whilst sitting;\nand in like manner did they, by (a session of) a hundred Ukthya (days), dispel\nthe darkness as far as one may see whilst standing.\n\n11:5:5:33\\. They spake, \'We do indeed dispel the darkness, but not the whole\nof it: come, let us resort to Father Pra _g_ apati.\' Having come to Father Pra\n_g_ apati, they spake, \'Reverend sir, when we were passing upwards to the\nworld of heaven the Asuras enveloped us in darkness.\'\n\n11:5:5:44\\. \'We entered upon a sacrificial session of a hundred Agnish _t_\nomas, and dispelled the darkness as far as one may see whilst sitting; and in\nlike manner did we dispel the darkness as far as one may see whilst standing:\ndo thou teach us, reverend sir, how, by dispelling the Asuras and darkness,\nand all evil, we shall find (the way to) the world of heaven!\'\n\n11:5:5:55\\. He spake, \'Surely, ye proceeded by means of two sacrifices, the\nAgnish _t_ oma and Ukthya, which do not contain all Soma-rites 1;--enter ye\nupon\n\np. 92\n\na sacrificial session of a hundred Atiratras: when ye have thereby repelled\nthe Asuras and darkness, and all evil, ye shall find the world of heaven.\'\n\n11:5:5:66\\. They entered upon a sacrificial session of a hundred Atiratras;\nand, having thereby repelled the Asuras and darkness, and all evil, they found\n(the way to) the world of heaven. In their first fifty days 1 the night-hymns\nreached into the day, and the day-hymns into the night.\n\n11:5:5:77\\. They spake, \'Verily, we have got into confusion and know not what\nto do: come, let us resort to Father Pra _g_ apati!\' Having come to Father Pra\n_g_ apati, they spake (the verses), \'Our night-hymns are (chanted) in daytime,\nand those of the day at night: O sage, being learned and wise, teach thou us\nwho are ignorant (how to perform) the sacrifices!\'\n\n11:5:5:88\\. He then recited to them as follows, \'A stronger, pursuing, has, as\nit were, driven a great snake from its own place, the lake: therefore the\nsacrificial session is not carried through.\'\n\n11:5:5:99\\. \'For your \xc3\x82 _s_ vina ( _s_ astra), being recited, has indeed\ndriven the morning-litany from its place 2.\'--\n\np. 93\n\n[paragraph continues] \'What ye, being wise, have unwise-like driven from its\nplace, take ye up that gently through the Pra _s_ ast _ri_ , reciting so as\nnot to disturb 1 (the Hot _ri_ ).\'\n\n11:5:5:1010\\. They spake, \'How, then, reverend sir, is (the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina- _s_\nastra properly) recited and how is the recitation not disturbed?\' He spake,\n\'When the Hot _ri_ , in reciting the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina- _s_ astra, reaches the end of\nthe Gayatra metre of the \xc3\x82gneya-kratu 2, the Pratiprasthat _ri_  3 should\ncarry round the Vasativari water 4, and bespeak the Pratar-anuvaka for the\nMaitravaru _n_ a (seated) between the two Havirdhana (carts containing the\noffering-material). The Hot _ri_ recites (the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina- _s_ astra) in a loud\nvoice, and the other (the Maitravaru _n_ a) repeats (the morning-litany) in a\nlow voice, only just muttering it: in this\n\np. 94\n\nway he does not run counter to (the Hot _ri_ \'s) speech by (his own) speech,\nnor metre by metre.\n\n11:5:5:1111\\. \'When the Pratar-anuvaka has been completed, he (the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ ), having offered, at their proper time 1, the Upa _m_ _s_\nu and Antaryama cups 2, presses out the straining-cloth and puts it in the Dro\n_n_ akala _s_ a 3. And when ye have performed the (offering of the cups of)\nfermented Soma 4, and returned (to the Sadas), ye should drink the fermented\nSoma (remaining in those cups). Having then, in the proper form, completed the\n"tail of the sacrifice," and taken up the cups of Soma (drawn) subsequent to\nthe Antaryama 5, and offered the oblation of drops 6, as well as the Santani-\noblation 7, ye should perform the Bahishpavamana chant, and enter upon the day\n(-performance).\'\n\n11:5:5:1212\\. Concerning this there are these verses:--With four harnessed\nSaindhava (steeds) the sages left behind them the gloom--the wise gods who\nspun out the session of a hundred sacrifices.\'\n\n11:5:5:1313\\. In this (sacrificial session) there are, indeed, four harnessed\n(steeds),--to wit, two Hot _ri_ s and two Adhvaryus.--\'Like unto the artificer\ncontriving spikes to the spear, the sages coupled the ends of\n\np. 95\n\ntwo days: now the Danavas, we know 1, will not disorder the sacrificial thread\nof them stretched out by us.--They leave undone the work of the previous day,\nand carry it through on the following day,--difficult to be understood. is the\nwisdom of the deities: streams of Soma flow, interlinked with streams of Soma!\n--Even as they constantly sprinkle the equal prize-winning 2 steeds, so (they\npour out) the cups full of fiery liquor in the palace of _G_ aname _g_ aya.\'\nThen the Asura-Rakshas went away.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[91:1](sbe44029.htm#fr_294) Viz. neither the Sho _d_ a _s_ in which, to (the\ntwelve stotras, and p. 92 _s_ astras of the Agnish _t_ oma, and) the fifteen\nchants, of the Ukthya, adds a sixteenth; and the Atiratra which has thirteen\nadditional chants (and recitations), viz. three nocturnal rounds of four\nchants each, and one twilight-chant, followed by the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina- _s_ astra,\nrecited by the Hot _ri_. No account is here taken of either the Atyagnish _t_\noma of thirteen chants, or the Aptoryama, which, to those of the Atiratra,\nadds four more chants. Cf. part ii, p. 397, note 2.\n\n[92:1](sbe44029.htm#fr_295) Or, perhaps, rather, in their days prior to the\nfiftieth (arvakpa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _s_ eshv aha _h_ su), St. Petersb. Dict.\n\n[92:2](sbe44029.htm#fr_296) The \xc3\x82 _s_ vina- _s_ astra, with the recitation of\nwhich, by the Hot _ri_ , the Atiratra concludes, takes the place, and is,\nindeed, p. 93 merely a modification, of the Pratar-anuvaka, or morning-litany\n(see part ii, p. 229, note 2), by which an ordinary Soma-sacrifice is ushered\nin. Like it, its chief portion consists of three sections, termed kratu, of\nhymns and detached verses addressed to the \'early-coming\' deities, Agni, Ushas\nand the two A _s_ vins. The whole is to consist of not less than a thousand B\n_ri_ hatis, that is to say, the whole matter is to amount to at least 36,000\nsyllables. For a full account of this _S_ astra, see Haug\'s Transl. of Ait.\nBr., p. 268.\n\n[93:1](sbe44029.htm#fr_297) Whilst the Hot _ri_ is reciting the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina-\nsastra, his first assistant, the Pra _s_ ast _ri_ (or, as he is more commonly\ncalled, the Maitravaru _n_ a), is to repeat the Pratar-anuvaka in a low voice.\n\n[93:2](sbe44029.htm#fr_298) The hymns and detached verses of each of the three\nsections--the \xc3\x82gneya-, Ushasya- and \xc3\x82 _s_ vina-kratu--of the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina- _s_\nastra (as of the Pratar-anuvaka) are arranged according to the seven principal\nmetres--gayatri, anush _t_ ubh, trish _t_ ubh, b _ri_ hati, ush _n_ ih, _g_\nagati, and pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti--forming as many subdivisions of the three sections.\n\n[93:3](sbe44029.htm#fr_299) That is, the first assistant of the Adhvaryu\npriest; the latter having to respond (pratigara) to the Hot _ri_ \'s calls (see\npart ii, p. 326, note 1) at the beginning and end of the _S_ astra, and to sit\nthrough the recitations (III, 9, 3, 11).\n\n[93:4](sbe44029.htm#fr_300) See III, 9, 2, 13 seqq.\n\n[94:1](sbe44029.htm#fr_301) Yathayatanam eva prak _ri_ tau yasmin kale huyeta\ntathaiva hutva, Say.\n\n[94:2](sbe44029.htm#fr_302) See IV, 1, 1, 22 seqq.; 1, 2, 21 seqq.\n\n[94:3](sbe44029.htm#fr_303) See II, 1, 2, 3, with note thereon.\n\n[94:4](sbe44029.htm#fr_304) That is, having, after the completion of the \xc3\x82 _s_\nvina- _s_ astra, offered to the A _s_ vins some of the Soma that has been\nstanding \'over the previous day.\'\n\n[94:5](sbe44029.htm#fr_305) Viz. the Aindravayava, Maitravaru _n_ a, &c., see\nIV, I, 3, 1 seqq.\n\n[94:6](sbe44029.htm#fr_306) See IV, 2, 5, 1 seqq.\n\n[94:7](sbe44029.htm#fr_307) Called \'savanasantani\' (? i.e. continuity of\npressing) by Katy., XXIV, 4, 1.\n\n[95:1](sbe44029.htm#fr_308) Saya _n_ a construes,--we know the extended\nsacrificial thread of these (days); and the Danavas (Asuras) do not henceforth\nconfound us. In that case the order of words would be extremely irregular.\n\n[95:2](sbe44029.htm#fr_309) Kash _th_ abh _ri_ ta _h_ , a _g_ yanta (!) kash\n_th_ ani tani bihhratiti kash _th_ abh _ri_ ta _h_ svadasa _m_ (? _kh_ andasa\n_m_ ) purvapadasya hrasvatvam, a _g_ idhavana _m_ k _ri_ tavato hayan a _s_\nvan, Say. According to this authority the general meaning of the verse is that\neven as the (king\'s) horses, when they have performed their task, have sweet\ndrinks poured out on (? to) them, and thus obtain their hearts\' desire, so the\ngods, by performing a sacrificial session of a hundred Atiratras, in\naccordance with Pra _g_ apati\'s directions, dispel the darkness and gain the\nworld of heaven.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 5, 6.
