There the following things have been placed:\n\n4\\. To the south (of the fire) twenty-one Darbha blades, a brass vessel with\nhot water, a razor of Udumbara wood or a mirror, and a barber with a razor in\nhis hand;\n\n5. 5 To the north, bull's dung and a mess of boiled rice with sesamum seeds which may be more or less cooked.\n\n6. 6 Let them fill vessels separately with rice and barley, with sesamum seeds and beans, and let them place (those vessels) to the east (of the fire).\n\n7\\. The boiled rice with sesamum seeds (Sutra 5) and all seeds (mentioned in\nSutra 6) are given to the barber.\n\n8\\. Then the mother, having dressed the son in a clean garment, sits down to\nthe west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.\n\np. 61\n\n9\\. To the west (of her), facing the east, the person stations himself who is\ngoing to perform that (ceremony).\n\n10\\. He then murmurs, fixing his thoughts on Savit _ri_ , looking at the\nbarber, (the Mantra), 'Hither has come Savit _ri_ with his razor' (MB. I, 6.\n1).\n\n11. 11 And fixing his thoughts on Vayu, looking at the brass vessel with warm water, (he murmurs the Mantra), 'With warm water, O Vayu, come hither' (ibid. 2).\n\n12\\. Drawing water (out of that vessel) with his right hand he moistens the\npatch of hair on the right side (of the boy's head) with (the Mantra), 'May\nthe waters moisten thee for life' (ibid. 3).\n\n13\\. With (the Mantra), 'Vish _n_ u's tusk art thou' (ibid. 4) he looks at the\nrazor of Udumbara wood or at the mirror.\n\n14\\. With (tile Mantra), 'Herb! Protect him!' (ibid. 5) he puts seven Darbha\nblades, with their points turned towards (the boy's) head, into the patch of\nhair on the right side of his head.\n\n15\\. Pressing them down with his left hand, and seizing with his right hand\nthe razor of Udumbara wood or the mirror, he touches with it (the Darbha\nblades), with the (Mantra), 'Axe! Do no harm to him!' (ibid. 6).\n\n16\\. With (the Mantra), 'With which Pushan has shaven B _ri_ haspati's head'\n(ibid. 7), he moves forward (that razor or the mirror) three times towards the\neast without cutting (the hair); once with the Ya _g_ us, twice silently.\n\np. 62\n\n17\\. Then (the barber) with the razor of metal cuts the hair and throws (the\ncut off hair ends) on the bull's dung.\n\n18\\. In the same way (after the same rites have been performed), he cuts the\npatch of hair on the back-side;\n\n19\\. And that on the left side.\n\n20. 20 He should repeat (when going to cut the hair on the back-side, and then again on the left side, the rites stated above), beginning from the moistening of the hair (Sutra 12).\n\n21\\. Grasping with his two hands (the boy) round his head he should murmur\n(the verse), 'The threefold age of _G_ amadagni' (MB. I, 6, 8).\n\n22\\. In the same way (the rites are performed) for a girl,\n\n23\\. (But) silently.\n\n24. 24 The sacrifice, however, (is performed) with the Mantra.\n\n25. 25 Walking away from the fire in a northerly direction they have the arrangement of (the boy's) hair made according to the custom of his Gotra and of his family.\n\n26\\. They throw the hair on the bull's dung (mentioned above), take it to the\nforest, and bury it.\n\n27\\. Some throw them on a bunch (of grass or the like).\n\np. 63\n\n28\\. Then they may do what they like.\n\n29\\. A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[60:1](sbe30021.htm#fr_241) 9, 1. The _K_ u _d_ akara _n_ a. Khadira-G _ri_\nhya II, 3, 16 seq. On the literal meaning of _K_ u _d_ akarana, see _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 28, 1 note.\n\n[60:2](sbe30021.htm#fr_242) Comp. above, II, 1, 13.\n\n[60:5](sbe30021.htm#fr_243) Comp. above, chap. 7, 9; G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha\nII, 39.\n\n[60:6](sbe30021.htm#fr_244) I believe that four vessels were filled, one with\nrice, one with barley, one with sesamum seeds, and one with beans. The Dvandva\ncompounds vrihiyavais and tilamashais cannot justify the conclusion that one\nvessel was filled with rice and barley mixed, and another with sesamum seeds\nand beans, for the plural patra _n_ i shows that there were more than two\nvessels. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 17, 2, says, vrihiyavamashatilana _m_ p _ri_ thak\npur _n_ a _s_ arava _n_ i.\n\n[61:11](sbe30021.htm#fr_245) I have translated the Mantra according to the\nreading of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana (G _ri_ hya I; 17, 6) and Paraskara (II, 1, 6): ush\n_n_ ena Vaya udakenehi. Gobhila has udakenaidhi.\n\n[62:20](sbe30021.htm#fr_246) Thus on the back-side seven Darbha blades are put\ninto the hair, and on the left side seven. This makes, together with the seven\nblades put into the hair on the right side (Sutra 14), twenty-one, the number\nstated in Sutra 4.\n\n[62:24](sbe30021.htm#fr_247) In the description of the Ku _d_ akara _n_ a\ngiven in this chapter no sacrifice is mentioned. See, however, I, 9, 28.\n\n[62:25](sbe30021.htm#fr_248) G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha II, 40.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 10](sbe30022.htm)\n\n"
