But also (persons standing) between (are qualified for knowledge); for\nthat is seen (in scripture).\n\nA doubt arises whether persons in want who do not possess means, &c., and\ntherefore are not able to enter one or the other of the a _s_ ramas., standing\nbetween as it were, are qualified for knowledge or not.--They are not\nqualified, the purvapakshin maintains. For we have ascertained that the works\nincumbent on the a _s_ ramas are the cause of knowledge, and those persons\nhave no opportunity to perform those works.--To this the Sutrakara replies.\n'But also between.' Even a person who because he does not belong to an a _s_\nrama stands between, as it were, is qualified for knowledge. 'For that is\nseen.' For we meet with scriptural passages declaring that persons of that\nclass--such as Raikva and the daughter of Va _k_ aknu--possessed the knowledge\nof Brahman ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 1; B _ri_. Up. III, 6, 8).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 37](sbe38246.htm)\n\n"
