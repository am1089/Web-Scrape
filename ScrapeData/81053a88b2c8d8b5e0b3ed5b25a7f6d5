And on account of the prohibition, in Sm _ri_ ti, of (the _S_ udras')\nhearing and studying (the Veda) and (knowing and performing) (Vedic) matters.\n\nThe _S_ udras are not qualified for that reason also that Sm _ri_ ti prohibits\ntheir hearing the Veda, their studying the Veda, and their understanding and\nperforming Vedic matters. The prohibition of hearing the Veda is conveyed by\nthe following passages: 'The ears of him who hears the Veda are to be filled\nwith (molten) lead and lac,' and 'For a _S_ udra is (like) a cemetery,\ntherefore (the Veda) is not to be read in the vicinity of a _S_ udra.' From\nthis latter passage the prohibition of studying the Veda results at once; for\nhow should he study Scripture in whose vicinity it is not even to be read?\nThere is, moreover, an express prohibition (of the _S_ udras studying the\nVeda). 'His tongue is to be slit if he pronounces it; his body is to be cut\nthrough if he preserves it.' The prohibitions of hearing and studying the Veda\nalready imply the prohibition of the knowledge and performance of Vedic\nmatters; there are, however, express prohibitions also, such as 'he is not to\nimpart knowledge to the _S_ udra,' and 'to the twice-born belong study,\nsacrifice, and the bestowal of gifts.'--From those _S_ udras, however, who,\nlike Vidura and 'the religious hunter,' acquire knowledge in consequence of\nthe after effects of former deeds, the fruit of their knowledge cannot be\nwithheld,\n\np. 229\n\nsince knowledge in all cases brings about its fruit. Sm _ri_ ti, moreover,\ndeclares that all the four castes are qualified for acquiring the knowledge of\nthe itihasas and pura _n_ as; compare the passage, 'He is to teach the four\ncastes' (Mahabh.).--It remains, however, a settled point that they do not\npossess any such qualification with regard to the Veda.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 39](sbe34108.htm)\n\n"
