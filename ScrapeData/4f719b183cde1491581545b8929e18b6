THE R\xc4\x80MA CHANDRA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.\n\nIn Northern India this is perhaps the most popular of all the incarnations of\nVishnu, and certainly the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana, in which his history is found, contains\nsome of the most beautiful legends in the whole of the sacred writings of the\nHindus. The R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana is very largely occupied with the story of R\xc4\x81ma\'s life,\nand the poets have found in its legends subjects for their most attractive\npoems. A whole volume might easily be written, giving a biography of this most\npopular hero; we must, however, content ourselves with the merest outline of\nhis doings.\n\nMr. Griffiths, in the preface to his translation of the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana, says, "The\ngreat exploit and main subject of the Epic is the war which R\xc4\x81ma waged with\nthe giant R\xc4\x81van, the fierce and mighty King of Lanka or Ceylon, and the dread\noppressor of gods and nymphs, and saints and men." "The army," to borrow the\nwords of Gorresio, "which R\xc4\x81ma led on this expedition was, as appears from the\npoem, gathered in great part from the region of the Vindhya hills; * but the\nraces which he\n\np. 171\n\nassembled are represented in the poem as monkeys, either out of contempt for\ntheir barbarism, or because at that time they were little known to the\nSanskrit-speaking Hindus. The poet calls the people whom\n\n[![THE R\xc4\x80MA CHANDRA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.](tn/17100.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/17100.jpg)  \nTHE R\xc4\x80MA CHANDRA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.  \n\n[paragraph continues] R\xc4\x81ma attacked Rakshasas. Rakshasas, according to the\npopular Indian belief, are malignant beings, demons of\n\np. 172\n\nmany shapes, terrible and cruel, who disturb the sacrifices and religious\nrites of the Br\xc4\x81hmans. It appears indubitable that the poet of the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana\napplied the hated name of R\xc4\x81kshasas to an abhorred and hostile people, and\nthat this denomination is here rather an expression of hatred and horror than\na real historical name." The account of R\xc4\x81ma which follows is taken from the\ntranslation of the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana in verse by Mr. Griffiths.\n\nDasaratha, the King of Ayodha, being childless, determined to make an\n_asvamedh_ , or horse sacrifice, to obtain a son. It was necessary, in order\nto make an acceptable offering, that the horse destined for sacrifice be\nallowed to wander at will for a whole year, as a sign that the authority of\nits owner was acknowledged by the neighbouring princes. The people loved their\nking, and during his reign were very prosperous; but, owing to the want of a\nson, the happiness of king and subjects was incomplete. The sacrifice\ntherefore was determined on, the holy place fixed, the horse set free, and the\nking, encouraged by the Br\xc4\x81hmans, invited the neighbouring princes to attend\nthe great preparations made. At length the rite was satisfactorily\naccomplished and the presiding Br\xc4\x81hman addressing Dasaratha said:--\n\n"Four sons. O monarch, shall be thine,  \n Upholders of the royal line. *  \n   *         *         *         *  \n Another rite will I begin,  \n Which shall the sons thou cravest win,  \n When all things shall be duly sped  \n And first Atharva texts be read." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe gods having graced the assembly the saint who performed the rite thus\naddressed them:--\n\np. 173\n\n"For you has Dasaratha, slain  \n The votive steed, a son to gain;  \n Stern penance rites the king has tried,  \n And in firm faith on you relied.  \n And now with undiminished care  \n A second rite would now prepare.  \n But, O ye gods, consent to grant  \n The longing of your suppliant." *\n\nThe gods, pleased with the Br\xc4\x81hman\'s prayer, led by Indra, proceeded to\nBrahm\xc4\x81, and presented to him their united petition, in which they mention the\ngreat work they wished R\xc4\x81ma, as one of Dasaratha\'s sons, to perform:\n\n"O Brahm\xc4\x81, mighty by thy grace,  \n R\xc4\x81van, who rules the giant race,  \n Torments us in his senseless pride  \n And penance-loving saints beside.  \n For thou, well-pleased in days of old,  \n Gayest the boon that makes him bold,  \n That gods nor demons e\'er should kill  \n His charmed life, for so thy will.  \n We, honouring that high behest,  \n Bear all his rage, though sore distrest.  \n That lord of giants, fierce and fell,  \n Scourges the earth, and heaven and hell.  \n Mad with thy boon, his impious rage  \n Smites saint and bard, and god and sage.  \n The sun himself withholds his glow,  \n The wind, in fear, forbears to blow;  \n The fire restrains his wonted heat  \n Where stands the dreaded R\xc4\x81van\'s feet,  \n And, necklaced with the wandering wave.  \n The sea before him fears to rave.  \n Kuvera\'s self, in sad defeat,  \n Is driven from his blissful seat.  \n We see, we feel, the giant\'s might,  \n And woe comes o\'er us and affright.\n\np. 174\n\nTo thee, O lord, thy suppliants pray  \nTo find some cure this plague to stay." *\n\nTo this request Brahm\xc4\x81 makes answer--\n\n     "One only way I find  \n To slay this fiend of evil mind.  \n He prayed me once his life to guard  \n From demon, god, and heavenly bard,  \n And spirits of the earth and air;  \n And I, consenting, heard his prayer.  \n But the proud giant, in his scorn,  \n Reeked not of man of woman born.  \n None else may take his life away,  \n But only man the fiend may slay." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nUpon this Vishnu appears, is gladly welcomed by the assembled gods, and asks\nwhat request they have to make:\n\n"King Dasaratha, thus cried they,  \n Fervent in penance many a day,  \n The sacrificial steed has slain,  \n Longing for sons, but all in vain.  \n Now, at the cry of us forlorn,  \n Incarnate as his seed be born.  \n Three queens has he; each lovely dame  \n Like Beauty, Modesty, or Fame.  \n Divide thyself in four, and be  \n His offspring by these noble three;  \n Man\'s nature take, and slay in fight  \n R\xc4\x81van, who laughs at heavenly might:  \n This common scourge, this rankling thorn,  \n Whom the three worlds too long have borne." \xe2\x80\xa1\n\nVishnu asks why it is necessary for him to effect their deliverance. Being\ntold of Brahm\xc4\x81\'s promise to R\xc4\x81van, he at length consents to be born as man, in\norder to slay the giant and his family.\n\np. 175\n\nNot long after this, a messenger comes from Vishnu, laden with a golden vase\nof nectar, which, as he gives it to the king, instructs him to hand it to his\nqueens, assuring them that\n\n"They the princely sons shall bear,  \n Long sought by sacrifice and prayer." *\n\nTo Queen Kausalya the king gave half the nectar, who through it became the\nmother of R\xc4\x81ma; the other half he gave to his other wives, who in consequence\nbecame mothers too--Kaikeya bore Bharat, and Sumitra gave birth to Lakshman\nand Satrughna.\n\nBefore leaving heaven, Vishnu besought the gods, for whose benefit he was\nabout to undertake the work, to assist him, and they did so in various ways,\nchiefly by begetting powerful sons to enter his army.\n\n"Each god, each sage became a sire,  \n Each minstrel of the heavenly quire,  \n Each faun, of children strong and good." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe names of some of the leaders who assisted R\xc4\x81ma in answer to this prayer\nrun as follows:--\n\n"Bali, the woodland hosts who led,  \n High as Mahendra\'s lofty head,  \n Was Indra\'s child. That noblest fire,  \n The Sun, was great Sugriva\'s sire.  \n T\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81, the mighty monkey, he  \n Was offspring of Vrihaspati:  \n T\xc4\x81ra, the matchless chieftain, boast  \n For wisdom of the V\xc4\x81nar host.  \n Of Gandham\xc4\x81dan, brave and bold,  \n The father was the Lord of gold.  \n Nala the mighty, dear to fame,  \n Of skilful Visvakarma came.  \n From Agni, Nila bright as flame,\n\np. 176\n\n[paragraph continues]  Who in his splendour, might, and worth,  \n Surpassed the sire who gave him birth.  \n The heavenly Asvins, swift and fair,  \n Were fathers of a noble pair,  \n Who, Dwivida and Mainda named,  \n For beauty like their sires were famed.  \n Varun was father of Sushen;  \n Of Sarabh, he who sends the rain [Parjanya].  \n Hanum\xc4\x81n, best of monkey kind,  \n Was son of him who breathes the wind;  \n Like thunderbolt in frame was he,  \n And swift as Garud\'s self could flee.  \n These thousands did the gods create,  \n Endowed with might which none could mate,  \n In monkey forms that changed at will,  \n So strong their wish the fiend to kill." *\n\nIn due time the four sons of Dasaratha were born; and from infancy the\nstrongest affection existed between R\xc4\x81ma the firstborn and Lakshman, and\nbetween Bharat and Satrughna.\n\nWhen R\xc4\x81ma was about sixteen years of age, a saint named Visvamitra came to\nDasaratha\'s court, asking his assistance against two demons, named Maricha and\nSuvahu, who were commanded by R\xc4\x81vana to annoy him, and prevent the completion\nof his sacrifices. At first the king pleaded the youthfulness of his son as an\nexcuse for refusing to allow him to undertake a work so arduous; but at length\nhis scruples were overcome, and R\xc4\x81ma with the faithful Lakshman set out for\nthe hermitage. When the travellers reached the banks of the Sarju, the saint\ngave R\xc4\x81ma two spells which he was to employ whilst bathing, and which were so\nto affect him that he should have no equal in heaven or hell:\n\n"None in the world with thee shall vie,  \n O sinless one, in apt reply,\n\np. 177\n\n[paragraph continues]  In knowledge, fortune, wit, and tact,  \n Wisdom to plan, and skill to act." *\n\nOn their journey to the hermitage they visit several places of importance, and\nVisvamitra beguiles the time with numerous legends; he also bestows on R\xc4\x81ma\nvarious arms and powers. On reaching the end of their journey, for six days\nand nights they have to watch for the demons; just as the sacrifice was about\nto end, these disturbers of the hermitage appear, are conquered by R\xc4\x81ma, and\ntheir attendants by Lakshman. The saint, addressing R\xc4\x81ma, says--\n\n"My joy, O prince, is now complete:  \n Thou hast obeyed my will;  \n Perfect before, this calm retreat  \n Is now more perfect still." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nNext morning the hermits tell R\xc4\x81ma that King Janaka of Mithila \xe2\x80\xa1 had arranged\nfor a sacrifice to which they are invited. R\xc4\x81ma is asked to accompany them,\nand is induced to do so by the mention of a wonderful bow in possession of the\nking, which no one was able to bend. The bow was a gift from Siva, as a reward\nfor sacrifice. On the way to Mithila they pass through a grove, in which,\nunseen by gods and men, Ahaly\xc4\x81, the wife of Gautama the sage, had been\nundergoing penance for countless ages, on account of her adultery with Indra.\nThough the god came to her in the form of her husband, she saw through his\ndisguise, yet did not resist his overtures. Her husband condemned her to live\nunknown in the forest until R\xc4\x81ma should liberate her. Her hour of release had\nnow come: R\xc4\x81ma sees her, touches her feet, and, the curse being at an end, her\nhusband receives her back.\n\np. 178\n\nIn due time they reach Mithila. The princes are introduced to the king, who\ngives them a hearty welcome, and narrates the history of the world-famed bow\nthey have come to see. He tells them it was the bow with which Siva, when\nangry at not being invited to Daksha\'s sacrifice, wrought such havoc amongst\nthe assembled gods. It was held by successive monarchs of his line as a mark\nof sovereignty, and as a means of defence against their foes.\n\n               "This gem of bows,  \n That freed the God of gods from woes,  \n Stored by our great forefathers, lay  \n A treasure and a pride for aye." *\n\nOne day, as Janaka was ploughing, an infant sprang from the ground, whom he\nnamed Sit\xc4\x81 (a furrow), on account of her secret birth. In the "Uttara K\xc4\x81nda,"\n\xe2\x80\xa0 is a legend, the object of which is to show that Sit\xc4\x81 is another form of\nLakshmi, and that it was she who wished to accomplish the death of R\xc4\x81vana.\n"R\xc4\x81vana in the course of his wanderings comes to the Himalayas, where he meets\nwith a young woman of marvellous beauty, named Ved\xc4\x81vati, dressed in ascetic\ngarments, and living the life of a devotee. He speaks of love; but she\nindignantly rejects his overtures, saying that it was her father\'s wish she\nshould wed Vishnu, and that she had already wedded him with her heart. R\xc4\x81vana\npresses his suit, assuring her that he is superior to Vishnu. She says that\nnone but he would contemn that deity. R\xc4\x81vana replies by touching her hair.\nBeing very indignant at this, she declares that she will enter the fire (die)\nbefore his eyes. Before doing so, she says, \'Since I have been insulted in the\nforest by thee, who art wicked-hearted, I\n\np. 179\n\nshall be born again for thy destruction. For a man of evil design cannot be\nslain by a woman; and the merit of my austerity would be lost if I were to\nlaunch a curse against you. But if I have performed, or bestowed, or\nsacrificed aught, may I be born a virtuous daughter--not produced from the\nwomb--of a righteous man.\' She then entered the blazing fire. It was she who\nwas born as the daughter of King Janaka. The mountain-like enemy (R\xc4\x81vana), who\nwas virtually destroyed before by her wrath, has now been destroyed by her\nafter she had associated herself with Vishnu\'s superhuman energy."\n\nRegarding the child thus mysteriously found to be other than of mortal birth,\nto all suitors for her hand Janaka gave one reply--\n\n"I give not this my daughter; she  \n Prize of heroic worth shall be." *\n\nShe was to be the wife of him who could bend the wonder-working bow. Many of\nthe neighbouring princes had tried, but failed. And now Janaka says--\n\n"This heavenly bow, exceeding bright,  \n These youths shall see, O anchorite.  \n Then if young R\xc4\x81ma\'s hand can string  \n The bow that baffled lord and king,  \n To him I give, as I have sworn,  \n My Sit\xc4\x81, not of woman born." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe bow is brought, and R\xc4\x81ma invited to try his strength. He takes it up\neasily in his hand, and as he was drawing the string, it snapped in two, to\nthe wonder and fright of the beholders. R\xc4\x81ma thus becomes the successful\nsuitor of Sit\xc4\x81, and messengers are despatched\n\np. 180\n\nto invite his father to the wedding. His two brothers also come; and not only\nR\xc4\x81ma and Sita are united, but his three brothers are wedded to the three other\ndaughters of Janaka. They then return home and live in happiness and\nprosperity.\n\nAfter a time King Dasaratha wishes to abdicate in favour of R\xc4\x81ma his\nfirstborn. When he had fixed upon a suitable time, the old man sends for his\nson, and enjoins him to prepare himself for the great event, by passing the\nnight in holy exercises. The people hearing of the king\'s intention are\ndelighted; the city is illuminated, and they spend the night in festivities.\nIn the mean time a servant goes to Kaikeya, the mother of Bharata, and\nsucceeds in exciting her jealousy of R\xc4\x81ma to such an extent, that she secludes\nherself in the room of discontent in the palace. The king visits her, when she\nsays to him--\n\n"Now pledge thy word, if thou incline  \n To listen to this prayer of mine." *\n\nIgnorant of what her petition is, the king foolishly promises to grant it,\nbefore it is expressed. She, calling the gods to witness the promise and oath\nof her husband, reminds him that on an occasion of great danger she alone had\nstood by him, and that he then promised her a boon.. She now requested the\nfulfilment of that vow; or,\n\n"If thou refuse thy promise sworn,  \n I die despised before the morn," \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nand concludes her address by asking that her son be installed as Prince\nRegent, and R\xc4\x81ma be sent to live a hermit\'s life in the forest for fourteen\nyears.\n\np. 181\n\nThe king, almost mad with grief at this request, being bound by word and oath,\nis compelled to comply. The city is in tears that but yesterday was bright\nwith joy; and the ceremony that was arranged for R\xc4\x81ma is performed in favour\nof Bharata, much against his will. R\xc4\x81ma tried to persuade Sit\xc4\x81 to allow him to\nproceed to the forest alone; but to this she will not for a moment consent.\nThe interview between them on this occasion is one of the most beautiful and\ntouching incidents in the whole story. She despises difficulties, dangers and\ndiscomforts, if she is with her husband; and avers that death would be\npreferable to separation. Lakshman\'s entreaty to accompany them is very\ntouching too:\n\n"I need not homes of god on high,  \n I need not life that cannot die;  \n Nor would I wish, with thee away,  \n O\'er the three worlds to stretch my sway." *\n\nAt length R\xc4\x81ma, Sit\xc4\x81, and Lakshman depart, amidst the tears of the whole city.\nWhen they reach the forest Dandaka, they seek a quiet spot, and at last settle\ndown at. Chitrakuta.\n\nDasaratha dies of grief a short time after their departure, and the city is\nagain flooded with tears. Bharata visits the exiles, with the intention of\nbringing his brother home to occupy the throne, but to this R\xc4\x81ma will not\nconsent. Bharata therefore continues to rule in his stead, but always regards\nhim as the rightful king, and keeps a pair of his shoes, which are exposed to\nview on state occasions, to indicate that Bharata is acting only as Viceroy.\n\nThe three meet with many adventures in the forest, where they live the life of\nascetics. One day they see\n\np. 182\n\nan immense giant, named Viradha, clothed in a tiger\'s skin, and\n\n"Three lions, tigers four, ten deer,  \n He carried on his iron spear." *\n\nThis giant, taking Sit\xc4\x81 aside, threatens to kill and eat her; but after a\ntime, changing his mind, proposes to keep her; and, thinking that he is acting\ngenerously towards R\xc4\x81ma, offers to allow him to go off unharmed. At length\nthey fight; but as the giant is proof against their weapons, they do not make\nmuch progress. After a time he takes up R\xc4\x81ma and Lakshman on his shoulders,\nand runs away with them. As they are being carried each succeeds in cutting\noff one of his arms. The giant falls, weak from loss of blood; and, seeing\nthat their weapons cannot deprive hire of life, they bury him alive. After\nthis adventure, they reach the hermitage, and R\xc4\x81ma becomes the protector of\nhermits throughout the district.\n\nWhen ten years of his forest life were past, R\xc4\x81ma sets off for the hermitage\nof Agastya, a man who had gained great merit by his austerities. There they\nbuild a cottage, but are not able to live in peace very long. As R\xc4\x81ma and Sit\xc4\x81\nare sitting together under a tree, a giantess named Suparnakh\xc4\x81, the sister of\nR\xc4\x81vana, passes by, and falls madly in love with R\xc4\x81ma.\n\n"She, grim of eye and foul of face,  \n Loved his sweet glance and forehead\'s grace;  \n She of unlovely figure, him  \n Of stately form and shapely limb;  \n She whose dim locks disordered hung,  \n Him whose bright hair on high brows clung." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe giantess questions R\xc4\x81ma as to the reason of his being in the forest. After\ngiving a full account of himself\n\np. 183\n\nand Sit\xc4\x81, he inquires who she may be. She says she is R\xc4\x81van\xc4\x81\'s sister, and\nopenly avows her love:\n\n"This poor misshapen Sit\xc4\x81 leave,  \n And me, thy worthier bride, receive.  \n Look on my beauty, and prefer  \n A spouse more meet than one like her;  \n I\'ll eat that ill-formed woman there;  \n Thy brother, too, her fate shall share.  \n But come, beloved, thou shalt roam  \n With me through all our woodland home." *\n\nR\xc4\x81ma, smiling, told her that as he was married he could not accept her kind\noffer, but advised her to try his brother. She acts upon this advice; but\nLakshman sends her back to R\xc4\x81ma. Thinking that Sit\xc4\x81 was the obstacle to the\nattainment of her wishes, she was about to slay her; R\xc4\x81ma prevented her from\ndoing this, and Lakshman cut off her nose and ears. She fled to her brother\nKhara, whose anger she roused by the tale of her mutilation, who sent fourteen\ngiants, giving them strict orders to kill R\xc4\x81ma, Sit\xc4\x81, and Lakshman. These\ngiants are easily slain. Khara is terribly angry when he hears of their death;\nand, quickly raising an army of 14,000 warriors, goes against his foes. R\xc4\x81ma,\nsingle-handed, destroyed them nearly all.\n\nOne of the giants, named Akampan, rushed away to inform R\xc4\x81vana of the\ncatastrophe. R\xc4\x81vana, intensely angry, asks--\n\n"Who is the wretch shall vainly try  \n In earth, heaven, hell, from me to fly?  \n Vaisravan, Indra, Vishnu, He  \n A Who rules the dead, must reverence me;  \n For not the mightiest lord of these  \n Can brave my will, and live at ease. . . .  \n With unresisted influence, I  \n Can force e\'en Death himself to die." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\np. 184\n\nHe then asks particulars of the fight, and determines to avenge his sister.\nThe messenger informs him that it is useless for him to attempt to conquer\nR\xc4\x81ma by force, and advises him rather to carry off Sit\xc4\x81; for,\n\n"Reft of his darling wife, be sure  \n Brief days the mourner will endure." *\n\nR\xc4\x81vana orders his chariot, starts off alone to Maricha, and asks his\nassistance, who dissuades him from attempting to fight with R\xc4\x81ma; but soon\nafterwards, when Suparnakh\xc4\x81, with her mutilated face, appears before R\xc4\x81vana,\nshe arouses his indignation. As he sat on his throne he is thus described:--\n\n"A score of arms, ten necks, had he,  \n His royal gear was brave to see;  \n His stature like a mountain height,  \n His arms were strong, his teeth were white.  \n    *          *          *          *  \n"Ten thousand years the giant spent  \n On dire austerities intent;  \n And of his heads an offering, laid  \n Before the Self-existent, made." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe giantess retells her tale, exciting her brother\'s anger afresh. He\nimmediately sets off again for the hermitage of the fiend Maricha, and asks\nhim to assist in his exploit by assuming the form of a golden deer with silver\nspots, by which Sita\'s attention would be attracted.\n\n"Doubt not the lady, when she sees  \n The wondrous deer among the trees,  \n Will bid her lord and Lakshman take  \n The creature for its beauty\'s sake."\n\nMaricha, remembering the power of R\xc4\x81ma when as a mere boy he went to assist\nthe hermit Visvamitra, and\n\np. 185\n\nhow he himself was wounded by him, again tries to dissuade R\xc4\x81vana. But this\ntime he cannot prevail, and there is not much choice left him, for R\xc4\x81vana\ndeclares--\n\n"Thy life, if thou the task essay,  \n   In jeopardy may stand;  \n Oppose me, and this very day  \n   Thou diest by this hand." *\n\n[![R\xc4\x80VANA.](tn/18500.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/18500.jpg)  \nR\xc4\x80VANA.  \n\nMaricha assumes the form of a deer, and, proceeding to the vicinity of the\nhermitage, attracts the attention\n\np. 186\n\nof Sit\xc4\x81, who becomes anxious to possess it. R\xc4\x81ma, leaving Lakshman to guard\nthe home, goes in pursuit, and shoots it. As the fiend was dying, assuming\nR\xc4\x81ma\'s voice, he cried out loudly enough to be heard by the wife and brother,\n"Ho, Sit\xc4\x81! Ho, Lakshman!" They imagining that some evil had come to R\xc4\x81ma,\nLakshman hurried towards the spot whence the cry proceeded; whilst R\xc4\x81vana, who\nwas waiting near, seized the opportunity to carry off the defenceless Sit\xc4\x81.\nThe demon did his best to induce her to yield herself an easy prey; but though\nshe struggled hard, and cried for help to all who came near, none were able to\ndeliver her. Held in his magical car, they reached Lanka, where she was placed\nin one of R\xc4\x81vana\'s palaces. He tried both by kind words and fearful\nthreatenings to win her love; but kindness and cruelty were equally\nineffective. To comfort her, Brahm\xc4\x81 sent Indra, who managed to elude the\nvigilance of her guards, and assured her of the sympathy of the gods, and of\nthe fact that all would yet be well with her husband and herself.\n\nWhilst this was happening at Lanka, R\xc4\x81ma was almost mad with grief. When\nLakshman came to him after the deer was slain, he feared some evil had\nhappened; and on their return to the cottage, as Sit\xc4\x81 was not to be found, his\nanguish was intolerable. He wandered about calling upon the trees, mountains,\nand rivers to tell him what had happened to his loved one; but they were\nsilent as the grave. A vulture at the point of death, who had fought with\nR\xc4\x81vana on Sit\xc4\x81\'s behalf, informs him of her capture by the great fiend. (See\npart iii. chap. vii.)\n\nIn their wanderings, the brothers meet with a giant named Kabandha, who, owing\nto a curse, had to wear the hideous form in which he appeared, until his arms\n\np. 187\n\nshould be cut off by R\xc4\x81ma. As he was running away with the brothers on his\nshoulders, they fulfilled this condition, there being no other way of escape\nfor them. On learning who they were, he was delighted, and asked them, as a\nfavour, to burn his body in order that he might regain his proper form, and\nascend to heaven. As the flames encircled him, he assumed a heavenly shape,\nand when in mid-air, told them where Sit\xc4\x81 was taken, and advised them to seek\nthe help of Sugriva, the King of the V\xc4\x81nar * (Monkey) tribes, as only through\nhis aid could they recover her. Acting upon this advice, they proceed to\nPampa, Sugriva\'s home; where the sight of the beauty of the lake causes R\xc4\x81ma\'s\nlamentations to burst forth afresh:\n\n"By sights like these of joy and peace,  \n My pangs of hopeless love increase." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nWhen Sugriva saw the brothers, imagining them to be friends of his brother\nB\xc4\x81li, by whom he had been deprived of his throne, he was greatly alarmed, and\nsent Hanum\xc4\x81n, his commander-in-chief, to learn who they\n\np. 188\n\nwere, and why they had come. When Hanum\xc4\x81n learns the object of their visit,\nthinking they might be induced to assist his master to regain his kingdom, he\npromises Sugriva\'s help, and, taking them upon his shoulders, hurries off with\nthem into the presence of the V\xc4\x81nar king. A league is made immediately, and\nafter R\xc4\x81ma had promised that the usurper B\xc4\x81li should fall that day, Sugriva\nsays of Sit\xc4\x81--\n\n"Yea, though in heaven the lady dwell,  \n Or prisoned in the depths of hell,  \n My friendly care her way shall track,  \n And bring thy ransomed darling back." *\n\nSugriva produces a robe, bracelets, and anklets that fell from Sit\xc4\x81 as she was\nbeing carried off by R\xc4\x81vana; the anklets R\xc4\x81ma recognizes at once, and is\ngreatly comforted as Sugriva tells him that though at present unable to inform\nhim where Sit\xc4\x81 has been taken, he will be able to obtain this information, and\nassist him in his attempt to rescue her. Sugriva then narrates the story of\nhis quarrel with his brother, but, ere he believes that R\xc4\x81ma can materially\nassist him, wished to test the wonderful bow of the hero. He was greatly\nastonished as he saw an arrow R\xc4\x81ma discharged pierce seven palm-trees in line,\npass through a hill behind them, and, after traversing six subterranean\nworlds, return to the quiver. The V\xc4\x81nar king, seeing he has secured no common\nally, goes forth fearlessly against his brother; and in the fight, when\nSugriva was getting worsted, R\xc4\x81ma sends an arrow which slays his brother. This\nwas regarded by the dying man as an act of gross injustice, because R\xc4\x81ma slew\nhim without informing him who he was; had\n\np. 189\n\nhe only known he would gladly have assisted him in his quest for Sit\xc4\x81.\n\nSugriva, on the fall of his brother, re-ascends the throne, but is so fully\noccupied with the pleasures of his position as to forget the promise of help\nhe had given R\xc4\x81ma, by whose prowess his dominion had been regained. Hanum\xc4\x81n,\never faithful to R\xc4\x81ma\'s cause, reminds him--\n\n"The realm is won, thy name advanced,  \n The glory of thy house enhanced;  \n And now thy foremost care should be  \n To aid the friends who succoured thee." *\n\nBut this reminder of his duty is insufficient to arouse the king from his\nselfish enjoyment; it was not until R\xc4\x81ma sends a strong message by Lakshman\nthat he is alive to his duty. When, however, he does move, it is to collect a\nmighty army. Of the troops collected for this enterprise it is said--\n\n"Thousands, yea, millions shall there be  \n Obedient to their king\'s decree.  \n        *        *        *        *  \n Fierce bears and monkey troops combined,  \n And apes of every varied kind,  \n Terrific in their forms, who dwell  \n In grove and wood and bosky dell." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe king gave instructions to each leader of a division, as to the limits of\nthe district he was to search for the lost princess; but as R\xc4\x81vana was\nbelieved to have gone towards the south, Hanum\xc4\x81n\'s district, special\ninstruction was given to him; and R\xc4\x81ma entrusted him with a ring which, if\nsuccessful in discovering Sit\xc4\x81, he could show her as a proof that he was a\nmessenger from her husband. For a long time the search was fruitless, and\nwould have been given up as\n\np. 190\n\nhopeless, but for Hanum\xc4\x81n\'s perseverance. When they were about to relinquish\nthe search, they met the vulture Sampati, brother of Jatayus, whom R\xc4\x81vana had\nslain as he attempted to prevent him from carrying off Sit\xc4\x81. This bird was the\nfirst to put R\xc4\x81ma on the right track for obtaining his wife. Sampati, hearing\nthat R\xc4\x81vana had slain his brother, was most anxious to avenge his death, and\nwillingly rendered all the assistance he could. He informs the seekers that\nSit\xc4\x81 is at Lanka.\n\n"A hunched leagues your course must be,  \n Beyond this margin of the sea;  \n Still to the south your way pursue,  \n And there the giant R\xc4\x81van view." *\n\nBut here a difficulty occurred: there were a hundred leagues of water to be\ncrossed; who could make the leap? Hanum\xc4\x81n again comes to the front and\ndeclares--\n\n"Swift as a shaft from R\xc4\x81ma\'s bow,  \n To R\xc4\x81van\'s city I will go." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nAccording to his promise, Hanum\xc4\x81n made the marvellous spring. After meeting\nwith various adventures, at length he reaches the capital of Lanka, and,\ndiminishing in size until he is no bigger than a cat, passes through the city\nunnoticed, and finally enters the Asoka grove where Sit\xc4\x81 was confined. He was\njust in time to witness an unsuccessful attempt of R\xc4\x81vana to induce his lovely\ncaptive to forget her husband, and become his bride. R\xc4\x81vana\'s parting words to\nSit\xc4\x81 on this occasion were not very love-inspiring; he declared that unless\nwithin two months she consented to become his bride,\n\n"My cooks shall mince thy limbs with steel,  \n And serve thee for my morning meal." \xe2\x80\xa1\n\np. 191\n\nWhen she is alone, Hanum\xc4\x81n addresses her. At first, on hearing a monkey speak,\nshe imagines herself dreaming; but the sight of her husband\'s ring convinces\nher that the strange messenger is a friend, and she is delighted to hear all\nhe has to tell:\n\n"\'Thou bringest me,\' she cried again,  \n \'A mingled draught of bliss and pain:  \n Bliss that he wears me in his heart,  \n Pain that he wakes and weeps apart.\'" *\n\nThough Hanum\xc4\x81n had found Sit\xc4\x81, and offered to carry her on his shoulders to\nher long-lost husband, a difficulty arose; she feared that in rising to the\nheight which so long a leap necessitated, she might be giddy, and find it\nnecessary to lay hold of him; but of her own free will she would on no account\nso much as touch the limbs of living man except those of her husband. Instead,\nthen, of availing herself of the monkey\'s offer, she prefers to remain where\nshe is for the present, and simply sends back a kind message to R\xc4\x81ma, with a\ngem to assure him that she has received his. Hanum\xc4\x81n does not care to return\nwithout having effected some injury on his foe; he therefore destroys the\ngrove and temple, and slays several of R\xc4\x81vana\'s heroes. At length he is made\ncaptive. When taken before R\xc4\x81vana, he confesses that he is a messenger from\nR\xc4\x81ma to Sit\xc4\x81, and earnestly advises her restoration. This so exasperates the\ngiant that he would have slain him at once had he not been an envoy--and an\nenvoy\'s life is sacred. Some of R\xc4\x81vana\'s people, however, set fire to his\ntail, and though he does not experience much pain, he manages to set fire to\nthe city in several places.\n\nWhen Hanum\xc4\x81n had completed his work in Lanka, he made a return leap to India,\nplaced Sit\xc4\x81\'s gem in\n\np. 192\n\n[paragraph continues] R\xc4\x81ma\'s hand, and told him all that had transpired in\nR\xc4\x81vana\'s capital. The prince was delighted to hear of his wife\'s constancy;\nbut as the difficulty of transferring an army from the mainland over a hundred\nleagues of sea seemed impossible to surmount, he despaired of seeing her\nagain. Sugriva, more practical and fuller of resource, says--\n\n                     "Thy task must be  \n To cast a bridge across the sea,  \n The city of our foe to reach,  \n That crowns the mountain by the beach;  \n And when our feet that isle shall tread,  \n Rejoice and deem thy foeman dead." *\n\nThe army, which had remained some distance away, now marches to the seashore,\nand R\xc4\x81ma is very curious to learn by what means so vast a bridge can be built.\nHe in his anguish calls upon the sea to withdraw and allow his followers to\nmarch across as on dry land; but although the Ocean will not grant this\nprayer, he does assist with his advice, as he tells him to enlist the services\nof a tribe of Dasyas (servants), who, together with the monkey host, construct\na bridge in five days. No sooner is this completed than the troops march\nacross, R\xc4\x81ma being carried by Hanum\xc4\x81n, and Lakshman by Angad; and though\nR\xc4\x81vana hears of their approach, and his spies, terrified at the appearance of\nthe invading army, counsel him to yield, he obstinately refuses, and at last\nthe attack upon his city is made.\n\nAfter fierce fighting, with considerable loss on both sides, R\xc4\x81ma and Lakshman\nare dangerously wounded by Indrajit, a son of R\xc4\x81vana; but on some wonderful\nherbs being applied to them by Garuda, the marvellous bird of Vishnu, they are\nrestored. A second time they\n\np. 193\n\nfall, and are again restored by herbs which Hanum\xc4\x81n fetched in an incredibly\nshort space of time from the Himalayas. At last R\xc4\x81ma and R\xc4\x81vana meet face to\nface. R\xc4\x81ma\'s destructive arrows seem at first to have met with a foe as\nwonderful as themselves:\n\n"Straight to its mark the arrow sprang,  \n And from the giant\'s body shred,  \n With trenchant steel, the monstrous head.  \n There might the triple world behold  \n The severed head adorned with gold.  \n But when all eyes were bent to view,  \n Swift in its stead another grew." *\n\nActing on the advice of M\xc4\x81tali, R\xc4\x81ma, tired of this fruitless toil, launched\nan arrow " whose fire was kindled by the Almighty Sire," which pierced the\ngiant\'s heart and laid him dead at his feet. Hanum\xc4\x81n is despatched to assure\nSit\xc4\x81 of the death of her captor, and in a few hours she is carefully sent in a\nlitter by Vibhishan, the brother and successor of R\xc4\x81vana. This litter R\xc4\x81ma\ncauses to be opened, that the monkeys may see his wife\'s face, as he says--\n\n"A woman\'s guard is not her bower,  \n The lofty wall, the fenced tower:  \n Her conduct is her best defence,  \n And not a king\'s magnificence." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThis speech struck terror in the hearts of all around, and Sit\xc4\x81 especially is\nalmost heartbroken as, instead of the warm and loving welcome she had\nanticipated, he coolly tells her--\n\n"Lady, at length my task is done,  \n And thou, the prize of war, art won.  \n        *       *       *       *\n\np. 194\n\n"If from my home my queen was reft,  \n This arm hath well avenged the theft;  \n And in the field has wiped away  \n The blot that on my honour lay.  \n         *       *       *       *  \n"But, lady, \'twas not love for thee  \n That led mine army o\'er the sea.  \n         *       *       *       *  \n"I battled to avenge the cause  \n Of honour and insulted laws.  \n My love is fled, for on thy fame  \n Lies the dark blot of sin and shame;  \n And thou art hateful as the light  \n That flashes on the injured sight.  \n The world is all before thee: flee:  \n Go where thou wilt, but not with me.  \n         *       *       *       *  \n"For R\xc4\x81van bore thee through the sky,  \n And fixed on thine his evil eye;  \n About thy waist his arms he threw,  \n Close to his breast his captive drew;  \n And kept thee, vassal of his power,  \n An inmate of his ladies\' bower." *\n\nHearing these cruel and unexpected words, Sit\xc4\x81 makes a most pathetic appeal,\nin which she vehemently asserts her innocence; but as there are no signs of\nrelenting in her husband, she wishes to die, or to prove her innocence by the\nfire-ordeal, and asks Lakshman to prepare a funeral pile:\n\n"I will not live to bear this weight  \n Of shame, forlorn and desolate.  \n The kindled fire my woes shall end,  \n And be my best and surest friend." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nLakshman performs this sad office; and when all is ready, she walks round it,\nand, before entering the fire, addresses Agni:\n\np. 195\n\n"As this fond heart, by virtue swayed,  \n From Raghu\'s son has never strayed,  \n So universal witness, Fire,  \n Protect my body on the pyre.  \n As Raghu\'s son has idly laid  \n This charge on Sit\xc4\x81, hear and aid." *\n\nHaving made this appeal to Agni to proclaim her innocence, she enters the\nfire. The gods, descending from heaven in their glory, address R\xc4\x81ma, saying:\n\n"Couldst thou, the Lord of all, couldst thou,  \n Creator of the worlds, allow  \n Thy queen, thy spouse to brave the fire,  \n And give her body to the pyre?  \n Dost thou not yet, Supremely Wise,  \n Thy heavenly nature recognize?" \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nR\xc4\x81ma frankly confesses that he believes himself to be only a mortal; Brahm\xc4\x81\ntries to enlighten him, as he assures him that he is Vishnu incarnate for the\npurpose of slaying R\xc4\x81vana, and that Sit\xc4\x81, whom his cruel conduct had driven\ninto the fire, was no other than Lakshmi, his celestial spouse. In\nconfirmation of this, Agni appears in the fire, and, taking Sit\xc4\x81 by the hand,\nconducts her to her husband, and declares her to be pure and spotless. R\xc4\x81ma\nreceives her with the greatest joy, and states that he was certain of her\ninnocence all along, but that as others might have doubted her, he had caused\nher to pass through this ordeal.\n\nDasaratha, the father of R\xc4\x81ma, now descends from heaven, and tells him that\neven in that happy place he had been sad to witness the sorrows of his beloved\nson. Indra next appears, and, at R\xc4\x81ma\'s request, brings back to life the many\nV\xc4\x81nars who had perished in his cause; and then other gods thank R\xc4\x81ma for the\nrelief he has\n\np. 196\n\ngiven them by the death of R\xc4\x81vana. When these congratulations are over, R\xc4\x81ma,\nSit\xc4\x81, and Lakshman mount a magic car, lent him by Vibhishan, in which in a\nsingle day they travel from Lanka to his own city. On arriving near it,\nHanum\xc4\x81n is sent to inform Bharat of their return; and the joy this\nintelligence gives to the faithful Bharat, and to the citizens generally, is\nindescribable. R\xc4\x81ma quickly assumes his position as king and the people enjoy\nunexampled prosperity:\n\n"Ten thousand years Ayodha, blest  \n With R\xc4\x81ma\'s rule, had peace and rest.  \n No widow mourned her murdered mate,  \n No house was ever desolate.  \n The happy land no murrain knew,  \n The flocks and herds increased and grew,  \n The earth her kindly fruits supplied,  \n No harvest failed, no children died.  \n Unknown were want, disease, and crime,  \n So calm, so happy was the time." *\n\nThis state of universal happiness does not continue for ever. People in the\ncity have doubts regarding the purity of their queen, which at length reach\nthe ears of R\xc4\x81ma, who, taking advantage of a wish of Sit\xc4\x81 once again to see a\nhermitage, leaves her to live an ascetic life. When her twin sons, born in her\nforest home, come of age, she sends them to their father\'s court. The king on\nseeing them, deeply feels the injustice he had done their mother, and\ndetermines at any cost to reinstate her as his queen. On her arrival he asks\nher to assert her innocence before the assembled court; but even Situ could\nnot bear this. She calls to the earth which gave her birth now to give her a\nhome; the earth opened and received her into her bosom. After this R\xc4\x81ma grows\n\np. 197\n\ntired of life, and Time comes to inform him that his work is done. Hearing\nthis, the good king goes to the banks of the sacred stream, and forsaking his\nbody ascends to his home in heaven.\n\nR\xc4\x81ma, to a vast number of Hindus, is not merely the King of Ayodha, whose\nhistory is so pathetically told in the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana; nor the benefactor of gods,\nas he slew their enemy, R\xc4\x81vana; but their saviour and friend. As the dead are\ncarried to the river-side to be burned, the friends repeatedly cry, "R\xc4\x81ma,\nR\xc4\x81ma, Satya N\xc4\x81ma," _i.e._ " R\xc4\x81ma, R\xc4\x81ma, the true name." Probably this is owing\nto the fact that in life his power of intercession for the dead was great;\nwhilst his kindness to and care for his followers were such as to encourage\nmen\'s trust. He is said to have taken the whole of the inhabitants of his\nbeloved city Ayodha to Brahm\xc4\x81\'s heaven without their suffering death. At his\nintercession R\xc4\x81vana\'s spies were saved; and the V\xc4\x81nar hosts that had fallen in\nbattle were restored to life. He entreated his father Dasaratha to remove the\ncurse which he had pronounced upon Kaikeya, the mother of Bharata, through\nwhose unkindness R\xc4\x81ma had been exiled.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[170:*](hmvp25.htm#fr_165) It is a strange though real confirmation of the\ntruth of the underlying history of the hero that to this day the aboriginal\ntribes inhabiting the Vindhya hills have many legends relating to the life of\nR\xc4\x81ma and Sita, although they are not Hindus, and know but little of p. 171\nHinduism.

In order to show his power, R\xc4\x81vana\nraised the mountain in his arms; but Siva pressed it down with his toe, and\ncrushed R\xc4\x81vana in his arms, until he cried out with pain; and not until he had\npropitiated Siva for a thousand years did he release him.
