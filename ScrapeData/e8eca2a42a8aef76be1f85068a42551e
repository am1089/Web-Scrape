Each great day as it comes round is marked by its own particular\nglinting of sunlight on the leaves, its own rare bite of the morning air, or\nits own dancing of the blood at noon. When, in the early autumn, the tiny,\njonquil-like flowers are found fallen at dawn from the _shephalika_ bushes,\nand the children pick them up blossom by blossom for worship, men say with\nsomething of the gladsomeness of childhood itself, "Mother is coming! Mother\nis coming!" for they remind them of the festival of Durga, by this sign near\nat hand. In springtime, when the _asoka_ tree begins to adorn itself with its\nbunches of red flowers, that are said never to bud till the tree has heard the\nfootsteps of a beautiful woman, and the long slender buds of\n\np. 27\n\nthe leaf-almond begin to appear, the low castes are glad, for now is coming\n_Holi_ , the Easter of the primitive peoples. On the birthday of Krishna, late\nin the summer, it _must_ rain, in memory of the night so long ago when the\nLord of All was carried as a babe, by Vasudeva, through wind and storm. The\n_Kali Puja_ , with its myriads of tiny open lamps, seems always to happen on\nthe night of some marriage-flight amongst the insects, and always the little\nwinged creatures suffer death by fire on these altars of the Mother.\n\nBut there is no nature-festival to be compared with that of _Ras_. All through\nthe growing moon of the beautiful month of _Kartik_ , the women have gone to\nthe Ganges-side at evening, night after night, with flowers and lamps to offer\nvows. Now has come the full moon. It is the first of the cold weather. The\nwinter flowers are beginning to bloom. The world is full of relief from the\nlessening of the long heat. The very trees seem to rejoice in the unwonted\ncoolness, and this was the moment at which Krishna went with the cowherds to\nthe forest. Throughout the rains the cattle have been kept in the villages,\nand now they are taken to the distant pastures. Oh, the joy of the forests:\nthe long moonlight nights, the whispering trees, the enfolding dark, the\npresence of the Cowherd, who is in truth the Lord Himself! In those temples\n\np. 28\n\nwhich have the necessary buildings the image of Krishna is taken at evening\nout of its sanctuary, and conveyed in procession to a little Chapel of the\nExposition, there to be worshipped publicly until the morning. Here for three\ndays in the small hours of the night, when the moon has scarcely yet begun to\nwane, come the women to sit and worship, or to go round and round the altar in\na circle, silently praying. And choirs of priests chant the while. And the\nimage-sellers drive a brisk though almost silent trade, and the precincts of\nthe temple are thronged with life, imagining itself out in the forest amongst\nthe cowherds, playing with the Lord.\n\nEvery full moon has its own special morsel of lore. To-night, at some hour or\nother, the sweet goddess Lakshmi will enter the room, and we must on no\naccount sleep lest we miss her visit. Again, it is unlucky this month for the\nheads of the family to see the moon. Therefore they must not look out of the\nwindow, and this is well, for to-night is the orchard-robbing festival, when\nthe boys of the village have right to enter the garden and carry off ripe\nfruit. What wonderful coincidence fixed it to fall when the harvest of the\njack-trees is ready for gathering?\n\nThe whole of Hinduism is one long sanctification of the common life, one long\nheart and\n\np. 29\n\nrelating of soul to the world about it; and the love of pilgrimage and the\nquest of sacred shrines speak of that same desire to commune with nature as\nthe village feasts. The holiness of nature is the fundamental thought of Hindu\ncivilisation. The hardships of life in camp and forest are called austerity;\nthe sight of grass and trees is called worship. And the soothing and peace\nthat come of a glimpse of a great river is held a step on the road to\nsalvation and the freeing of the soul.\n\nHow did this passion for nature become fixed and ritualised, in the series of\nthe year\'s fasts and feasts? Here opens out a field of most fruitful study. A\nfixed system of universal consent always presupposes some central authority,\nwhich persisted long enough not only to pronounce authentically on disputable\nmatters, but also to radiate as custom what had been thus determined. This\ncentral authority exists in India as the empire whose seat for nearly a\nthousand years was Pataliputra. 1 By its rulings was Hinduism, in so far as it\nis universal throughout the country, shaped and determined, and in order to\nknow exactly what this was in its daily working, it would be necessary to\nstudy in.\n\np. 30\n\ndetail the worships of Madras and the South. For here we have, more or less in\nits purity, the Hinduism which grew up, antithetically to Buddhism, during the\nBuddhist period. It differs in many ways from that of Bengal, since there the\nfaith went through a much longer period of elaboration. Pataliputra was\nsucceeded by Gour, the Guptas by the Sens, and in the year A.D. 728 Adisur\nSen, Emperor of the five Gours, as was his title, brought to his capital, and\nestablished there for the good of his people in matters of faith and\nscholarship, the celebrated five Brahmins of Kanauj. And they made the face of\nBengal to shine--which is a brief way of saying, probably, that this king\nestablished an ecclesiastical college of reference at Gour, which went on\nimpressing its influence on the life of Bengal, long after the original five,\nand their king, had been gathered to their fathers. Even after the Hindu\nsovereigns had fallen altogether, and the Mohammedan rulers had taken their\nplace, this Brahminical influence went on living and working. It was in fact\nthe Bengali form of Papacy, and before we rebel against it too much, before we\nasperse it too bitterly for the cerecloths of orthodoxy which it bound upon\nthe people, we ought to know what were the problems that it had to solve. It\ngave continuity to the social development of the community, in the face of the\nmost appalling revolutions.\n\np. 31\n\n[paragraph continues] It made the faith a strong ground of taste and manners\nand gave it consciousness of its strength. It made the village into a true\ncivic unit, in spite of complexity of caste and origins. It maintained the\ngrowth of literature and the epic-making faculty. And above all--the supreme\ngift of Hinduism--it went on deepening and widening the education of the\npeople by that form of mind-cultivation which is peculiar to India, the form\nthat she knows not as secular schooling but as devotional meditation, the\npower to which she will one day owe her recovery, should it be given to her to\nrecover her footing at all, in the world of nations.\n\nThe power of the Brahmin was never broken in Bengal till modern education\nbrought new tests to try men by. Mohammedanism had never touched it. The new\nreligion of Chaitanya was not even defiant of it. Automatically it had gone on\nworking and growing. The world is always ready to call any overthrowal of the\nold by the name of reformation, because in anything long established there is\nalways much that needs overthrow. Pruning and weeding are a parable of\nnecessary processes in thought and society also. But how can we call this a\nreformation unless we know what new ideals are to be substituted for the old?\nThat destruction has taken place is indisputable, but does destruction\n\np. 32\n\nalone constitute reformation? In any case, Bengal owes her own solidarity, her\nunity in complexity, her Hinduistic culture and the completeness of her\nnational assimilation, more perhaps to Adisur and the Brahminical college that\nhe established than to any other single fact of these many centuries.\n\nIf this theory be correct, if the wider Hinduistic formalism was the work of\nthe Guptas of Pataliputra, and the orthodoxy of Bengal more especially that of\nthe Sen kings of Gour, a wonderful amount of history lies in the study of the\ndifferences between the two. We shall in that case expect to find more ancient\nand less homogeneous fragments of the faith lying outside of Bengal. We shall\nlook, moreover, to study the development of the popular faith in parallelism\nwith Buddhism outside. For here a long obscuring process has been superposed\nupon the other. Those elements of Hinduism in which it has marked affinities\nwith the classical and pre-classical religions of Europe must, for the most\npart, be sought outside, in distant provinces, and at the conservative centres\nof the great pilgrimage shrines. But for the potentialities of Hinduism, for\nits power to bind and unite, for its civilising and liberalising effect, we\ncannot do better than go to Bengal. Here we may disentangle gradually the long\nstory of the influences\n\np. 33\n\nthat have made it what it is. Did the first image-makers come from China? And\nwhen? In what order were the main worships introduced? What was the original\nplace of the planetary deities, of snakes and of trees, in the scheme of\nthings? Who were Satya-Pir and Satya-Narayan? These questions, and a thousand\nlike them, have to be answered before we can understand and assign time and\nsource to all the elements that have gone to the making of the _sanatan\ndharma_ in Bengal. Yet wherever we go--north, east, or west--we shall always\nfind that India herself has been the inspiration of Hinduism, and that the\nfaith without the land is a name without a person, a face without a soul.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[29:1](seh09.htm#fr_1) Pataliputra, on the site of the modern Patna, in Behar;\ncapital of the ancient kingdom of Magadha, described by Megasthenes; in the\nthird century B.C. the metropolis of the Emperor Asoka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Dol-Jatra](seh10.htm)\n\n'
