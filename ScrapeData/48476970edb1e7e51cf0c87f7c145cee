[1b](ry313.htm#fn_652)  \nFor thee their armies will unite  \nWith chiefs, Mahendra\'s peers in might.  \nFrom Meru and from Vindhya\'s chain  \nThey come like clouds that bring the rain.  \nThese round thee to the war will go,  \nTo smite to earth thy demon foe;  \nWill slay the Rakshas and restore  \nThy consort when the fight is o\'er."  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[370:1](ry312.htm#fr_651) See Book I.
