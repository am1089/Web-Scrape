There would result permanent consciousness or non-consciousness, or else\nlimitative restriction to either.\n\nOn the other view, i.e. on the view of the Self being omnipresent and mere\nknowledge, it would follow either that consciousness and also non-\nconsciousness would permanently take place together everywhere; or else that\nthere would be definite permanent restriction to either of the two, i.e.\neither permanent consciousness or permanent non-consciousness.--If the\nomnipresent Self, consisting of mere knowledge only, were the cause of all\nthat actual consciousness and non-consciousness on the part of Selfs which\ntakes place in the world, it might be conceived either as the cause of both--\ni.e. consciousness and non-consciousness--and this would mean that there is\neverywhere and at all times simultaneous consciousness and non-consciousness.\nIf, on the other hand, it were the cause of consciousness only, there would\nnever and nowhere be unconsciousness of anything; and if it were the cause of\nnon-consciousness only, there would never and nowhere be consciousness of\nanything. On our view, on the other hand, the actually perceived distribution\nof consciousness and non-consciousness explains itself, since we hold the Self\nto abide within bodies only, so that naturally consciousness takes place there\nonly, not anywhere else.--The view, finally (held by the Vai _s_ eshikas), of\nthe consciousness of the Self depending on its organs (mind, senses, &c.;\nwhile the omnipresent Self is, apart from those organs, non-sentient, _g_ a\n_d_ a), results in the same difficulties as the view criticised above; for as\nall the Selfs are omnipresent they are in permanent conjunction with all\norgans; and moreover it would follow that the ad _ri_ sh _t_ as (due to the\nactions of the different bodies) could\n\np. 553\n\nnot thus be held apart (but would cling to all Selfs, each of which is in\ncontact with all bodies).\n\nHere terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the _knower_.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 33.
