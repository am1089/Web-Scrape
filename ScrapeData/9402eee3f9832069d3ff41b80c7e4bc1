Others might be cited; for instance, the\nadoration hymn to Hiranyagarbha (R. V. X. 121) who is therein described as the\nlord of the universe.\n\n"In the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha,  \nBorn as the only lord of all existence.  \nThis earth he settled firm and heaven established:  \nWhat god shall we adore with our oblations?  \nWho gives us breath, who gives us strength, whose bidding  \nAll creatures must obey, the bright gods even;  \nWhose shade is death, whose shadow life immortal:  \nWhat god shall we adore with our oblations?  \nWho by his might alone became the monarch  \nOf all that breathes, of all that wakes or slumbers,  \nOf all, both man and beast, the lord eternal:  \nWhat god shall we adore with our oblations?  \nWhose might and majesty these snowy mountains,  \nThe ocean and the distant stream exhibit;  \nWhose arms extended are these spreading regions:  \nWhat god shall we adore with our oblations?  \nWho made the heavens bright, the earth enduring,  \nWho fixed the firmament, the heaven of heavens;  \nWho measured out the air\'s extended spaces:  \nWhat god shall we adore with our oblations?" 1\n\np. 34\n\n[paragraph continues] Or one may point to such hymns as the following:\n\n"Who is our father, our creator, maker,  \nWho every place doth know and every creature,  \nBy whom alone to gods their names were given,  \nTo him all other creatures go to ask him." 2\n\n[paragraph continues] But such hymns are not numerous and probably belong to\nthe last epoch of the composition of the Vedic hymns. Most of the Vedic hymns\nexhibit a conspicuous tendency toward the polytheistic personification of\nnature. From most of them the monotheistic tendency is well-nigh absent. 1\n\nSo, also, the literature of the sacrificial manuals, the Brahmanas, emphasizes\nthe doctrine of the sacrifice. The adoration hymns of the different gods have\nlost their independent value and are esteemed only on account of the fact that\nthese verses, sometimes mutilated and torn out of their context, are uttered\nor chanted in connection with various sacrificial rituals. This literature\nalso contains some passages of a monotheistic or pantheistic character; but\nthe emphasis is almost entirely on the performance of the sacrifices. In the\nAranyaka literature, which contains the substitution-meditations, the value\nand power of thought is realized for the first time. But it is only in the\nUpanishads that one finds the earliest instances of a sincere and earnest\nquest after Brahman, the highest and the greatest. 2\n\nThe most important characteristic which distinguishes the science of Brahman\nfrom the science of the\n\np. 35\n\nsacrifices consists in the fact that the former springs entirely from inner,\nspiritual longings, while the latter is based almost wholly on mundane\ndesires. The science of sacrifice aimed at the acquirement of merit, which\ncould confer all the blessings of life in consequence of due obedience to the\nVedic and ritualistic injunctions and prohibitions. The science of Brahman,\nhowever, did not seek any ordinary blessings of life. It proceeded from the\nspiritual needs of our soul which could be satisfied only by attaining the\nhighest aim. All that is mortal, all that is transient and evanescent, all\nthat gives men the ordinary joys of life, such as wealth or fame confer, are\nbut brute pleasures and brute satisfactions, which please only so long as men\nallow themselves to be swayed by the demands of their senses. In the hurry and\nbustle of our modern life, of rapid movements over land, sea and air, in this\nage of prolific scientific inventions and appliances which add to our material\ncomforts and luxury, in this age of national jealousies and hatreds, which in\nthe name of patriotism and freedom often try to enslave others or monopolize\nthe necessities and luxuries of life for the use of the people of a particular\ncountry, it is easy to forget that we have any needs other than the purely\nmaterial ones. With all the boasted culture of our modern age, with all our\nadvancement of science and progress, do we ever stop to think just what we\nmean by progress? We have no doubt discovered many new facts of nature, and\nbrought many natural forces under our control. But like vultures soaring high\nin the air, with greedy eyes fixed on the bones\n\np. 36\n\nand flesh of the carrion in the field below, are we not, in all our scientific\nsoarings, often turning our greedy eyes to sense gratifications and trying to\nbind science to the attainment of new comforts and luxuries? The new comforts\nand luxuries soon become absolute necessities, and we eagerly press forward to\nthe invention of some other new modes of sense gratification and luxury.\nScience debased to the end of spreading death and of enslaving humanity, or to\nthe end of procuring newer and newer sensations, a life spent in the whirlpool\nof fleeting pleasures, varied, subtle, and new, and in the worship of the\nalmighty dollar is what most of us tend to call progress. We live more for the\nbody than for the soul. Our body is our soul; our body is our highest Brahman.\nThe story is told in the Chandogya Upanishads that Virochana and Indra went to\nPrajapati to receive instructions regarding the nature of the self, or of\nBrahman the highest. Prajapati gave a course of false instructions, apparently\nto test the powers of discrimination of his two pupils Virochana and Indra. He\nasked them to get themselves well-dressed and appear at their best, and then\nto look into a mirror. When they did so and saw the image of their own bodies\nin the mirror, Prajapati told them that it was their well-dressed bodies\nreflected in the mirror that was the true self and the highest Brahman; and\nthey went away satisfied with the answer. Indra, indeed, later returned to\nPrajapati dissatisfied with the answer; but Virochana (probably an old\nancestor of ours) was satisfied with the answer that there is nothing\n\np. 37\n\nhigher than what appears to our senses, our earthly body, and our earthly\njoys. 3\n\nBut what a different answer do we get from Maitreyi, the wife of Yajnavalkya\nin the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad II. 4. Yajnavalkya, wishing to become a\nhermit, explained to his two wives Maitreyi and Katyayani that he wished to\ndivide his wealth between them so that they might live independently while he\nwas away seeking his higher spiritual destiny. But Maitreyi replied: "Well,\nsir, if you could give me all the wealth of the world, could I become immortal\nby that?" "No," said Yajnavalkya, "you will only live in pleasure as the rich\nmen do, but I can promise you no hope of immortality through wealth." Maitreyi\nreplied, "Well, sir, what shall I do with that with which I cannot be\nimmortal? Tell me if you know anything by which I may be immortal." 4\n\nIt is this spiritual craving for immortality that distinguishes the mental\noutlook of the sages of the Upanishads from our own. Yet this desire for\nimmortality is no mere desire for personal survival continuing the enjoyment\nof pleasures under newer and happier conditions of life, whether in this world\nor in heaven. This quest for immortality, as it is found in the Upanishads, is\nin no sense a yearning for personal immortality, the decayless, diseaseless,\ndeathless existence of the individual with his body in full vigor of youth.\nNeither is it the desire for a bodiless existence of a self fond of sensual\njoys and sense gratifications and fettered by all the needs and necessities of\nmundane relations and mundane gratifications. This quest\n\np. 38\n\nfor immortality is identical with the quest of the highest self, the highest\ntruth and reality, the highest Brahman. It is the perception and realization\nof the inner spring of our life and the inmost spirituality of man as he is\nwithin himself, beyond the range of sense and of discursive thought. If it\nwere a sense-feeling--color, taste, touch, or sound--it might easily be\npointed out as this or that sense-datum. It is an ineffable, non-conceptual,\ninner experience, lying in its own unfathomable depth. When a lump of salt is\nthrown into the sea, it is entirely dissolved in it; by no means can any part\nof the lump be recovered in its original form, but every part of the water\ntastes saline. Similarly, when this stage of supra-consciousness ( _prajnana_\n) is reached, all ordinary experiences are submerged and dissolved in this.\ngreat, infinite, limitless, homogeneous experience. Like the calm and\nchangeless consciousness of deep, dreamless sleep, is this stage where all\nduality has vanished: there is no person who knows, nor anything that he is\naware of. Ordinary knowledge presupposes a difference between ourselves, our\nknowledge, and that of which we are aware. When I see a color, there is the\n"I" which sees, there is the knowledge of the color and also the color itself.\nWhen I smell, there is the "I" that smells and the smell; when I think, there\nis the "I" that thinks and that which is thought; when I speak there is the\n"I" that speaks and that which is spoken. No one would for a moment think of\nidentifying these. But at this stage of the non-conceptual intuition of the\nself--an unspeakable, ineffable experience--there is no\n\np. 39\n\ntrace of any duality, and we have one whole of blissful experience wherein is\ndistinguished no one that knows and nothing that he is aware of. All ordinary\nstates of knowledge imply a duality of knower and that which is known; but\nthis is an experience where all duality has vanished. 5\n\nNevertheless this experience is not something which is wholly beyond, or\nwholly out of all relation with, our conscious states of dual experience. For\nit is the basis, or background, as it were, of all our ordinary knowledge\ninvolving the knower and the known. In music, the different notes and tones\ncannot be grasped separately from and independently of the music itself, and\nwhen we are busy in apprehending separately the different notes we miss the\nmusic or the harmony which is in itself a whole of experience that cannot be\ntaken in parts, in the multiplicity of the varied notes. So it is with this\nineffable experience, which in reality underlies all our ordinary experiences\nand states of knowledge as the basis or ground of them all; when we are lost\nin the discursive multiplicity of our ordinary experience, we miss this\nunderlying reality. But when once again we are in touch with it, our so-called\npersonality is as it were dissolved in it, and there ensues that infinitude of\nblissful experience in which all distinctions are lost. Whatever is dear to\nme, as e.g., father, mother, wife, money, fame, etc., is so because I love my\nown self so dearly. It is because I can find the needs of my self best\nrealized through these that I love these. None of these can be ends in\nthemselves; it is only the self that can be an end unto itself, irrespective\n\np. 40\n\nof any other ulterior end or motive. None of the many-sided interests,\ndesires, and activities of the self represent the self in its entirety or in\nits essence. It is only this supra-conscious experience, which actually\nunderlies them all, that can be called the real self and that for which\neverything else exists. Everything else is dear to me because my self is dear\nto me; but this supra-conscious experience underlies the so-called\npersonality, or self, as its very essence, truth and final reality. 6\n\nIt is indeed difficult for us, with the traditions and associations of our\nmodern world, to believe in the reality of this intuitional experience, unless\nwe attempt to realize it ourselves--unless, by turning our minds entirely away\nfrom sense-objects and sense-enjoyments, we deliberately, with faith and\nfirmness, plunge into the depths of this new kind of experience. It cannot be\nexpressed in words or understood by conceptual thought; it reveals itself only\nto supra-conscious experience. The language of the sages of the Upanishads\nseems strange to us; but we cannot hope to understand a thing of which we have\nhad no experience. Talk to a child of ten about the romantic raptures of love\nfelt by a pair of lovers, or of the maddening intoxication of sense cravings;\nwhat would he understand of it? Talk to a Greenlander about the abominable\nheat of an African desert; will he be able to imagine it? When an experience\nis to be realized, the powers of mere logical thinking or of abstraction or of\nconstructive imagination are not sufficient for the purpose. Only another\nrealization of the same experience\n\np. 41\n\ncan testify to its truth. We are here concerned with an experience which is\nnon-conceptual, intuitive, and ultimate. But, what is more, subtle, fine and\nformless as it is, it is said to be the source, basis, and ground of\neverything else. According to a story told in the Chandogya Upanishad VI, when\nShvetaketu returned after a stay of twelve years at the house of his\npreceptor, where he studied all the Vedas, he became arrogant, considered\nhimself to be a wise man, and hardly ever talked with others. His father said\nto him: "Well, Shvetaketu, what have you learned that you seem to think\nyourself so wise? Do you know that which when once known everything else\nbecomes known? When you once know what iron is, you know all that can be made\nout of iron, for these are in essence nothing but iron; we can distinguish the\niron vessels from iron only by their specific forms and names. But whatever\nmay be their names and forms, the true essence in them all, whether they be\nneedles, pans or handles, is nothing but iron. It is only that you find\ntherein so many forms and names. What are these names and forms worth without\nthe essence? It is the essence, the iron, that manifests itself in so many\nforms and names; when this iron is known, all that is made of iron is also\nknown. It is the ineffable reality, the ultimate being which is the essence of\neverything else. As rivers which flow into the sea lose all their\nindividuality in it and cannot be distinguished, so all divergent things lose\ntheir individuality and distinctness when they are merged in this highest\nbeing, the ultimate reality from which they have all\n\np. 42\n\nsprung forth. Fine and subtle though this experience be, yet it is in reality\nthe entire universe of our knowledge. A small seed of an oak tree when split\nopen reveals nothing that we can call worth noting, yet it is this fine kernel\nof the seed that holds within it the big oak tree." 7\n\nThe chief features of this Upanishad mysticism are the earnest and sincere\nquest for this spiritual illumination, the rapturous delight and force that\ncharacterize the utterances of the sages when they speak of the realization of\nthis ineffable experience, the ultimate and the absolute truth and reality,\nand the immortality of all mortal things. Yet this quest is not the quest of\nthe God of the theists. This highest reality is no individual person separate\nfrom us, or one whom we try to please, or whose laws and commands we obey, or\nto whose will we submit with reverence and devotion. It is, rather, a totality\nof partless, simple and undifferentiated experience which is the root of all\nour ordinary knowledge and experience and which is at once the ultimate\nessence of our self and the highest principle of the universe, the Brahman or\nthe Atman. There is, indeed, another current of thought, evident in several\npassages of different Upanishads, in which Brahman is conceived and described\nas the theistic God. This will be dealt with separately later on. The special\ncharacteristic of the line of thought that has now been described is a belief\nin a superior principle which enlivens our life, thoughts, actions, desires\nand feelings, which is the inmost heart of the self of man, the immortal and\nundying reality\n\np. 43\n\nunaffected by disease and death, and which is also the ultimate and absolute\nreality of the universe. 8\n\nA story is told in the Katha Upanishad according to which King Vajashravasa\nmade a sacrifice involving a gift of all the valuables that he possessed. When\neverything of the sort had been given away, he made a supplementary gift of\nhis cows which were all old and useless. His son Naciketas, finding that these\ngifts would be more embarassing than useful to the recipient, disapproved of\nhis father\'s action. He thought that his father had not finished giving his\n"all" until he, his son, was also given away. So he asked his father, "To whom\nare you going to give me?" He was dear to his father; so his father did not\nlike this question and remained silent. But when the question was again and\nagain repeated, the father lost his temper and said, "I give you over to\ndeath." Then Naciketas went to the place of Yama, the king of death, where he\nremained fasting for three days and nights. Yama, willing to appease him,\nrequested him to take any boons that pleased him. Naciketas replied that men\ndo not know what happens to people when they have passed from earthly life,\nwhether they still continue to exist or whether they cease to exist; and he\nrequested Yama to answer this question on which there were so many divergent\nopinions. Yama in answer said that this was a very difficult question and that\neven the gods did not know what becomes of man after he passes away from his\nearthly life; that, therefore, he would rather give Naciketas long life, big\nestates, gold in abundance, horses, elephants, and\n\np. 44\n\nwhatever else in the way of earthly enjoyment might seem to him desirable. But\nthe philosophical quest was dearer to Naciketas than all the earthly goods\nthat the king of death could bestow upon him. Money, he thought, can not\nsatisfy man; money is of use only so long as a man lives, and he can live only\nso long as death does not take him away. This quest of the ultimate destiny of\nman, of his immortal essence, is itself the best and the highest end that our\nhearts may pursue. So Naciketas preferred to solve this mystery and riddle of\nlife rather than to obtain all the riches of the world and all the comforts\nthat they could purchase. 9\n\nThe king of death appreciated the wisdom of Naciketas\' choice. He explained\nthat there are two paths, the path of the good and the path of the pleasant,\nand that they are different paths, leading to two entirely different goals.\nThe mad hankering after riches can only justify itself by binding us with ties\nof attachment to sense-pleasures which are short-lived and transitory. It is\nonly the spiritual longing of man after the realization of his highest,\ninmost, truest, and most immortal essence that is good in itself, though it\ndoes not appeal to greedy people who are always hankering after money. Desire\nfor money blinds our eyes, and we fail to see that there is anything higher\nthan the desire for riches, or that there is anything intrinsically superior\nto our ordinary mundane life of sense-pleasures and sense-enjoyments. The\nnature of the higher sphere of life and of the higher spiritual experiences\ncannot be grasped by minds which are always\n\np. 45\n\nrevolving in the whirlpool of mad desires for riches and sense-enjoyments. As\nthe sage, in his serene enjoyment of spiritual experiences, may well think\nsense-pleasures dull, insipid, and valueless, so the multitude who live a\nworldly life of ordinary pleasures and enjoyments, fail to perceive the\nexistence of this superior plane of life and the demands of the spirit for the\nrealization of its immortal essence. They think that nothing exists higher and\ngreater than this mundane life of ordinary logical thought and sense-\nenjoyments. Most men live on this ordinary level of life; they see, hear,\ntaste, touch and smell. They think and they argue. They have a mind which\nthinks, feels, and wills, and they have senses which seek their own\ngratification. They employ the former in the service of the latter and every\nday discover newer and subtler ways of sense-gratification; they also employ\nthe latter to serve the former by furnishing sense data to guide and check the\ncourse of logical thought and the development of science. The more men, upon\ncomparing opinions, find themselves agreeing that they possess nothing of a\nmore lofty character, the more they cease to believe in the validity and truth\nof the existence of anything undying in man. They fail to notice that the life\nthey are living has had the effect of chilling and freezing the clear flowing\nstream of spiritual experiences and of stifling the spiritual instincts and\nlongings of the soul. Generations of lives spent without once turning the eyes\nto the spiritual light within have served to build up traditions, beliefs, and\ntendencies of such an order that faith in the existence\n\np. 46\n\nof the higher spirituality of man is lost. Discourse about the spirituality of\nman in its highest sense appears to most men to be no more than a myth of by-\ngone days or the result of the undue nervous excitation or heated imagination\nof a religious intoxication. The net result of our modern education,\ncivilization, and culture has been the disappearance of the belief that there\nis anything higher than the gratification of man\'s primitive instincts under\nsuch checks as society requires, the pursuit of the physical sciences, and the\nsuccessful employment of the art of reasoning for the satisfaction of all the\ndiverse interests of human beings. So Yama, the king of death, says to\nNaciketas that the majority of the people do not believe that there is\nanything higher than the ordinary mundane life, being content with the common\nconcerns and interests of life; that it is only the few who feel this higher\ncall and are happy to respond to it and to pursue a course of life far above\nthe reach of the common man. 10\n\nBut what is this undying spiritual essence, or existence? Cannot our powers of\nreasoning, as they are employed in philosophical discussion or logical\narguments, discover it? If they can, then at its best it can be nothing\nloftier than thought and can not be considered as the highest principle by\nwhich even thought itself and all conscious processes, as well as the\nfunctioning of all sense-operations, are enlivened and vitalized. So Yama\ntells Naciketas that this highest spiritual essence in us cannot be known by\ndiscursive reason. Only persons who have realized this truth can point this\nout to us as an experience which is at once\n\np. 47\n\nself-illuminating and blissful and which is entirely different from all else\nthat is known to us. Once it is thus exhibited, those who have the highest\nmoral elevation and disinclination to worldly enjoyments can grasp it by an\ninner intuitive contact with the reality itself ( _adhyatmayoga_ ). This truth\nis indeed the culmination of all the teaching of the Vedas. 11\n\nTo Naciketas\' question as to what becomes of men when they leave this earthly\nlife, Yama\'s answer is that no one is ever born and no one ever dies. Birth\nand death pertain only to our physical bodies, but our essence is never born\nand never dies. The birth and death of the physical body may well be explained\nby reference to physical causes, and there is not much of a mystery therein.\nBut man cannot be identified with his body, nor can he be identified simply\nwith the life which he has in common with all other animals, and even with\nplants. Life, in a large measure, seems to be nothing but a harmonious\nfunctioning of the inner organs of the body; but no one would say that these\nmovements of the organs can be called "man." There is a superior principle\nwhich vitalises and quickens the process of life, enlivens the activity of\nthought, moves the senses to their normal and regular operations, which is\nrealized, or intuited, as the very essence of our inner illumination, and\nwhich is also the highest and ultimate principle underlying all things. 12\n\nWe are here face to face with the real mysticism of the Upanishads. This\nhighest essence of man, the self, the Brahman, is difficult of perception; it\nis hidden, as in a deep cavern, in that deathless being who exists\n\np. 48\n\nfrom the beginning of all time and beyond all time. It is the subtlest, the\nsmallest of the small and yet the greatest of the great. It exists changeless\nand just the same one when everything else that it has vitalized has ceased to\nexist. This, our inmost self, cannot be known by much learning or scholarship,\nnor by sharp intelligence, nor by strong memory. It can only be known, or\nintuited, by the person to whom it reveals its own nature. In one place we are\ntold that it can be intuited only by an inner, direct, and immediate touch. In\nanother place it is said that it can only be perceived by those who have\npractised the perceiving of fine truths by a superfine intelligence of the\nhighest order (Katha I. 3.12). The path to this superior intuition is like the\nedge of a sharp razor, dangerous and difficult. It is beyond all sense-\nknowledge; and he who intuits this secret truth of the beginningless, endless,\nunchangeable and eternal overcomes all death. For, once one realizes oneself\nto be identical with this highest principle, death and the fear of it sink\ninto insignificant, illusory nothingness. 13\n\nThere is, however, another line of thought running through the different\nUpanishads in which Brahman appears as the supreme Lord from whom everything\nhas proceeded and who is the source of all energy. Thus in the Kena Upanishad\nwe find the query: "By whose will and directed by whom does the mind work, and\ndirected by whom did life first begin? By whose will does the organ of speech\nwork, and led by whom do the eye and the ear perform their respective\nfunctions?" Then comes the answer: "It is from Him\n\np. 49\n\nthat the organ of speech, the ear, the eye, the mind and life have all derived\ntheir powers; He is the thought of thought, the mind of mind, and the life of\nlife. So neither mind nor eye, neither ear nor speech, can tell us anything\nabout Him, because neither the eye nor the ear nor the mind can reach Him, but\nHe alone is the agent operative through all these organs and making the eye\nperceiver, the ear hearer, the mind a thinker and the life a living force. But\nHe, in his own nature, cannot be grasped by any one of these." 14\n\nA story is told to illustrate the greatness of Brahman as the supreme and all-\npowerful Lord. All the gods were at one time congratulating themselves on\ntheir own greatness, though all the while it was Brahman alone who was great.\nBrahman saw the false conceit of the gods and appeared before them as the all-\npowerful Lord. The gods sent the god of fire to him to enquire who this great\nLord was. Agni, the god of fire, approached him and this great Lord asked Agni\nwho he was and what he could do? Agni replied that he was the god of fire and\ncould burn the whole world. Brahman then put before him a straw and asked him\nif he could burn it. Agni tried with all his might to burn it, but failed.\nThereupon Agni returned to the gods saying that he could not learn who this\ngreat lord was. Vayu, the wind-god, approached Brahman and said that he was\nthe wind-god and could blow away the whole world. Again Brahman placed a straw\nbefore him, asking him to blow it away if he could. Vayu also failed and came\nback to the other gods. Then Indra came forward to inquire who this great Lord\n\np. 50\n\nwas, but Brahman had already disappeared from the scene. Thereupon a bright\nglorious goddess appeared in the sky and told him that this supreme Lord was\nBrahman, that He alone was great, and that all the powers of the gods of fire,\nwind, etc., were derived from him. 15\n\nIt is said in the Katha VI. 1-3 that all the worlds are maintained in him. He\nis like a big tree which has its roots far below and its branches above,\nforming the visible universe around us. He is the great Life from which\neverything else has come into being. Nothing dare ignore, disobey, or outstrip\nHim. He is like a great thunder of fear over us all. It is by His fear that\nthe fire and the sun give heat, that the wind blows, and that Death runs\nabout. He is elsewhere described (Brrh. IV. IV. 22) as the controller, Lord\nand master of all. He is the Lord of all that has been and all that will be.\nHe is the creator of the universe and the world belongs to Him and He to the\nworld (Brrh. IV. IV. 13). Yet He is the inmost self of all living beings (\n_sarvabhutantaratma_ ) and the immortal inner controller of them all (\n_antaryamin_ ). But, though He is the controller and creator of all, yet it is\nHe who has become this visible universe of diverse names and forms. Just as\nthe wind and the fire appear in different forms, so He also appears in all the\nvaried forms that present themselves to us in this world. Being one in\nHimself, He has become the visible many of the universe. But yet He is\nabsolutely untouched by faults and defects of this mortal world. As the Sun\nwhich by its light illumines all colors and forms for\n\np. 51\n\nthe eye and is yet unaffected by the defects of our eyes, so the Brahman, who\nby his light has brought all things into existence and continues as their\ninmost essence, is yet wholly unaffected by their defects, their mortal and\ntransitory forms. 16\n\nWhether the teaching of the Upanishads is to be called pantheism or not will\ndepend on the definition of pantheism. Certainly there are some passages such\nas those just considered which describe Brahman as having spread Himself in\ndiverse forms in all the objects that we see around us. This might readily be\ntaken as indication of some form of materialistic pantheism. But this is\nmerely one phase or aspect of the matter. It seems to be contradicted by the\nidea of Brahman as the creator, ruler, and controller, by whose will\neverything moves and the order of events is kept in its right place\nundisturbed. Neither life nor death nor any of the powers of nature can\ntransgress his orders; He is a thundering fear over us all, and yet He is also\nthe bridge by which all the diverse things of the world are connected with one\nanother and with man, their spiritual master. This latter conception, which is\npresent in many passages of the Upanishads, is apparently dualistic and\nimplies a personal God. The Shvetashvatara Upanishad abounds in passages of an\navowedly dualistic character. There it is said that He alone is the Lord of\nall bipeds and quadrupeds, the protector and master of the universe, and yet\nis hidden in all beings. The duality between the individual soul and God is\nalso definitely expressed in at least two of the earlier Upanishads, Mundaka\n3. 1. 1 and Shvetashvatara 4. 6,\n\np. 52\n\nwhere, with reference to Brahman and the individual, it is said that two birds\nwhich are alike in nature and friendly to each other reside in the same tree,\nbut that one of them (the individual) eats sweet fruits (i.e. of his own\ndeeds) while the other is happy in itself without eating any fruit whatsoever.\nIn the same Shvetashvatara Upanishad, the sage is described as saying: "I know\nthis great person who resides beyond all darkness (of sin and ignorance), as\nbright as the sun. He who knows Him escapes death and there is no other way of\nescape. There is nothing superior to Him, and there is nothing which is\ngreater than Him, and there is nothing smaller than Him. He stands alone by\nHimself in the Heavens unmoved like a tree, and yet the world is filled by\nthis person." But this also is a passing phase. In a passage immediately\npreceding that in the Mundaka Upanishad just referred to, it is said that\nBrahman is right before us in the front; Brahman is behind us in the back;\nBrahman is on the right and on the left. Again it is said in the Katha\nUpanishad: "He who perceives diversity in this world suffers the death of all\ndeaths." "He is the controller and the self of all beings; He makes the one\nform many, being one He satisfies the desires of the many." 17\n\nThe most important emphasis of the Upanishads seems to be on that ineffable\nexperience which lies hidden in the background of all our experiences and at\nthe same time enlivens them all. Yet the experiencer himself is lost, and\ndissolved as it were, in this superior experience, where there is neither\nexperiencer\n\np. 53\n\nnor that which is experienced. This experience, or state, cannot be\nintellectually grasped; it can only be pointed out as different from all that\nis known, or from all that can be described as "this" or "that." One can only\nassert that "It is not this," "It is not this." It is like the state of a deep\ndreamless sleep, like the feeling of intense bliss where neither the knower\nnor the known can be distinctly felt but where there is only the infinitude of\nblissful experience. 18\n\nThe various commentators upon the Upanishads belonging to different schools of\nthought and yet each interested to secure for himself the support of the\nUpanishads, have been fighting with one another for the last twelve hundred\nyears or more to prove that the Upanishads are exclusively in favor of one\nparty as against the others. Thus some contend that the Upanishads teach that\nBrahman alone exists and all the rest that appears is false and illusory.\nOthers hold that the Upanishads favor the doctrine of modified duality of man\nin God and of God in man. Still others maintain that the Upanishads give us\nexclusively a doctrine of uncompromising duality. And so forth. Passages have\noften been twisted and perverted, and many new connections and contexts have\nbeen introduced or imposed upon the texts, to suit the fancy or the creed of\nthe individual commentator. I think all these interpretations are biassed and\nonesided, and therefore inexact. The Upanishads reveal to us different phases\nof thought and experience, not a consistent dogmatic philosophy. The apparent\ninconsistency of the different phases of thought is removed if we take a\npsychological\n\np. 54\n\npoint of view and consider them as different stages of development in the\nexperience of minds seeking to grasp a sublime, ultimate but inexpressible\ntruth. This truth has a logic of its own, different from the logic of\ndiscursive thought wherein distinctions are firm and rigid, where concepts are\nlike pieces of brick mortared together by the logical movement of thought. Its\nlogic is that of experience in which the apparently contradictory ideas or\nthoughts lose their contradictoriness and become parts of one solid whole. The\ndifferent phases of experience are lived through and enjoyed as inalienable\nparts of one great experience. When attempts are made to describe any\nparticular phase of this experience it will naturally seem to conflict with\nthe other phases in the eyes of those who have not the capacity of realising\nthe concrete whole experience and who can only look at the phases from an\nexternal and a purely intellectual point of view where distinctions cannot be\nobliterated. When a lover embraces his beloved in his first kiss, he may feel\nher as the holiest angel, as his own dear life or as the embodiment of all his\nhappiness, as, Shelley says, his "Spouse, Sister Angel, Pilot of the Fate,"\n\n"Of unentangled intermixture, made  \nBy love, of light and motion; one intense  \nDiffusion, one serene Omnipresence."\n\n[paragraph continues] But these epithets when applied to a woman can hardly be\njustified, according to intellectual standards, as properly applied, though\nthe lover may have felt an indescribable sweetness of love in which all these\ndiverse\n\np. 55\n\nsentiments melted together to form its taste and flavor. The different phases\nof experience and belief which we find in the Upanishads need not therefore be\ntaken out and pitted against one another. They may all be regarded as stages\nof experience between which the minds of the sages oscillated in attempting\nthe realisation of a truth which was beyond speech, beyond thought and beyond\nall sense-perception. It was sometimes felt as the great over-lord, the\ncontroller, creator, ordainer, and master of all, sometimes as the blissful\nspiritual experience, and sometimes as the simple unity in which all duality\nhas vanished. 19\n\nThis truth, person, or absolute--whatever it may be called--was felt as the\nhighest embodiment of moral perfection. It is complete self-illumination,\nbodiless, faultless, sinless and pure. It is, as it were, covered by a cup of\ngold in such wise that we, looking at the shiny cup, miss the real treasure\nthat lies concealed beneath. Its illumination reveals itself only when our\nminds have turned away from all the external lights of the outside world; for\nwhere this light is shining, all the other lights of the sun, the moon, and\nthe stars have ceased to give light. The Upanishads tell us again and again\nthat it cannot be perceived by any of our senses and that it cannot be\ncomprehended by reasoning, or by logical and discursive thought, or by\ndiscussions, scholarship and much learning, or even by the reading of the\nscriptures. Only those who have ceased from all sinful actions and have\ncontrolled all their sense desires, who are unruffled by passions of all kinds\nand are at peace\n\np. 56\n\nwith themselves, can have the realization of this great truth by the higher\nintuitive knowledge ( _prajnana_ , as distinguished from _jnana_ , or\ncognition). In Mundaka III. 1, it is said that we can attain this self by\ntruth, control, spiritual fervor and absolute extinction of all sex desires.\nOnly the sages who have purged themselves of all moral defects and faults are\ncapable of perceiving this holy spiritual light within themselves. The\nUpanishads never tire of repeating that the revelation of this truth is\npossible only through the most perfect moral purity which results in a natural\nillumination of intuitive perception when one seeks to attain this partless\nessence through meditation. Not only can this truth not be perceived by the\neye or described in speech; but it cannot even be gained as a boon, or gift,\nby pleasing the gods or by ascetic practices or by sacrificial performances.\nIt can only be attained by an intuition ( _para_ ) which is superior in kind\nto the Vedic knowledge of sacrifices, called the lower knowledge ( _apara_ ).\nBy supreme moral elevation and untiring and patient search one can come in\ntouch with Brahman and can enter into Him, but one must abandon all his\nmundane desires by which he is bound to earthly things. And when through this\nhigh moral elevation, control of desires, meditation and the like, one comes\nface to face with this highest reality, or Brahman, he is lost in it like\nrivers in the sea; nothing remains of him which he can feel as a separate\nindividual, but he becomes one with Brahman. This is known by the seer through\nhis heart when his senses have ceased to move and when his thought and\n\np. 57\n\nintellect have come to a dead halt. No one can describe what that existence\nis; one can only say that it is "being," nothing more. Here all the knots of\nthe heart are untied, all doubts are dispelled, and there is one spiritual\nlight of unity that shines forth in its serene oneness. 20\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[33:1](hm04.htm#fr_2) Translation taken from Kaegi-Arrowsmith, _The Rig Veda_\n, p. 88 f.\n\n[34:2](hm04.htm#fr_3) R.
