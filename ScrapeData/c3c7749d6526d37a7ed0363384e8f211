They prepare (seats) each for his own fathers and maternal ancestors.\n\n3\\. With (the words), 'For N.N. I prepare (a seat); for N.N. I prepare (a\nseat)' (he prepares) a seat.\n\n4\\. With (the words), 'I satiate N.N.; I satiate N.N.' (he makes offerings of)\nwater.\n\n5\\. With (the words), 'Adoration to N: N.! Adoration to N.N.!'

The Ka _n_ _d_ anukrama of the \xc3\x82treyi- _s_\nakha, which has been printed by Professor Weber in his edition of the\nTaittiriya Sa _m_ hita, vol. ii, p. 356, shows that the dative Pali\xe1\xb9\x85gave ought\nto be corrected to Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gaye. The 'v _ri_ ttikara' is there called not Kau _n_\n_d_ inya, but Ku _n_ _d_ ina.\n\n[245:9](sbe30092.htm#fr_709) There is only one difference between the text of\nthis Sutra p. 246 and that of chap. 18, 3-7: instead of hutva trin\nadito\xe0\xa4\xbdnuvakan adhiyate (18, 4) we read here, hutva prathamenanuvakenadhiyate,\nwhich I believe must be translated, 'Having sacrificed with the first Anuvaka,\nthey recite (that Anuvaka).' Mat _ri_ datta says, hutva prathamottamanuvakam\nadhiyate.\n\n[246:13](sbe30092.htm#fr_710) See Sutras 10 and 11.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Introductory Note](sbe30093.htm)\n\n"
