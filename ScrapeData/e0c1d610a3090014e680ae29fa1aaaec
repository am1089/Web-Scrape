Since the day when I met with my p. 89\nLord, there has been no end to the sport of our love.  \nI shut not my eyes, I close not my ears, I do not mortify my body;  \nI see with eyes open and smile, and behold His beauty everywhere:  \nI utter His Name, and whatever I see, it reminds me of Him; whatever I do., it\nbecomes His worship.  \nThe rising and the setting are one to me; all contradictions are solved.  \nWherever I go, I move round Him,  \nAll I achieve is His service:  \nWhen I lie down, I lie prostrate at His feet.\n\nHe is the only adorable one to me: I have none other.  \nMy tongue has left off impure words, it sings His glory day and night:  \nWhether I rise or sit down, I can never forget Him; for the rhythm of His\nmusic beats in my ears. p. 90  \nKabir says: "My heart is frenzied, and I disclose in my soul what is hidden. I\nam immersed in that one great bliss which transcends all pleasure and pain."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XLII](sok043.htm)\n\n'
