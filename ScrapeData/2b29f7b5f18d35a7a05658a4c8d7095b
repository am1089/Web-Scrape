We shall explain the Upanayana (i.e. the initiation of the student).\n\n2. 2 Let him initiate a Brahma _n_ a at the age of seven years,\n\n3\\. A Ra _g_ anya, of eleven, a Vai _s_ ya, of twelve.\n\n4. 4 A Brahma _n_ a in the spring, a Ra _g_ anya in the summer, a Vai _s_ ya in the autumn.\n\n5\\. In the time of the increasing moon, under an auspicious constellation,\npreferably (under a constellation) the name of which is masculine,\n\n6. 6 He should serve food to an even number of Brahma _n_ as and should cause them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!'\xc2\x97\n\n7\\. (Then he) should have the boy satiated, should\n\np. 138\n\nhave his hair shaven, and after (the boy) has bathed and has been decked with\nornaments\xc2\x97\n\n8\\. He should dress him in a (new) garment which has not yet been washed.\n\n9. 9 In a place inclined towards the east, (or) inclined towards the north, (or) inclined towards northeast, or in an even (place), he raises (the surface on which he intends to sacrifice), sprinkles it with water,\n\n10\\. Kindles fire by attrition, or fetches common (worldly) fire, puts the\nfire down, and puts wood on the fire.\n\n11. 11 He strews eastward-pointed Darbha grass round the fire;\n\n12\\. Or (the grass which is strewn) to the west and to the east (of the fire),\nmay be northward-pointed.\n\n13. 13 He (arranges the Darbha blades so as to) lay the southern (blades) uppermost, the northern ones below, if their points are turned (partly) towards the east and (partly) towards the north.\n\n14. 14 Having strewn Darbha grass, to the south of the fire, in the place destined for the Brahman,\n\n15. 15 Having with the two (verses), 'I take (the fire) to myself,' and, 'The fire which (has entered)'\xc2\x97taken possession of the fire,\n\n16. 16 And having, to the north of the fire, spread out Darbha grass, he prepares the (following) objects,\n\np. 139\n\naccording as they are required (for the ceremony which he is going to\nperform):\n\n17. 17 A stone, a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, a skin (of an antelope, or a spotted deer, &c.), a threefold-twisted girdle of Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass if he is a Brahma _n_ a (who shall be initiated), a bowstring for a Ra _g_ anya, a woollen thread for a Vai _s_ ya, a staff of Bilva or of Pala _s_ a wood for a Brahma _n_ a, of Nyagrodha wood for a Ra _g_ anya, of Udumbara wood for a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n18. 18 He binds together the fuel, twenty-one pieces of wood, or as many as there are oblations to be made.\n\n19\\. Together with that fuel he ties up the (three) branches of wood which are\nto be laid round the fire, (which should have the shape of) pegs.\n\n20. 20 (He gets ready, besides, the spoon called) Darvi, a bunch of grass, the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya pot, the pot for the Pra _n_ ita water, and whatever (else) is required;\n\n21\\. All (those objects) together, or (one after the other) as it happens.\n\n22. 22 At that time the Brahman suspends the sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, sips water, passes by the fire, on its west side, to the south side, throws away a grass blade from the Brahman's seat, touches water, and sits down with his face turned towards the fire.\n\np. 140\n\n23. 23 He takes as 'purifiers' two straight Darbha blades with unbroken points of one span's length, cuts them off with something else than his nail, wipes them with water, pours water into a vessel over which he has laid the purifiers, fills (that vessel) up to near the brim, purifies (the water) three times with the two Darbha strainers, holding their points to the north, places (the water) on Darbha grass on the north side of the fire, and covers it with Darbha grass.\n\n24. 24 Having consecrated the Proksha _n_ i water by means of the purifiers as before, having placed the vessels upright, and having untied the fuel, he sprinkles (the sacrificial vessels) three times with the whole (Proksha _n_ i water).\n\n25. 25 Having warmed the Darvi spoon (over the fire), having wiped it, and warmed it again, he puts it down.\n\n26\\. Having besprinkled (with water) the Darbha grass with which the fuel was\ntied together, he throws it into the fire.\n\n27. 27 He melts the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, pours the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya into the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya pot over which he has laid the purifiers, takes some coals (from the fire) towards the north, puts (the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on these (coals), throws light (on the\n\np. 141\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc3\x82 _g_ ya by means of burning Darbha blades), throws two\nyoung Darbha shoots into it, moves a fire-brand round it three times, takes it\n(from the coals) towards the north, pushes the coals back (into the fire),\npurifies the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya three times with the two purifiers, holding their points\ntowards the north, (drawing them through the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya from west to east and)\ntaking them back (to the west each time), throws the two purifiers into the\nfire,\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[137:2](sbe30044.htm#fr_454) 1, 2. The statement commonly given in the G _ri_\nhya-sutras and Dharma-sutras is, that the initiation of a Brahma _n_ a shall\ntake place in his eighth year, though there are differences of opinion whether\nin the eighth year after conception, or after birth (\xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya\nI, 19, 1. 2). Mat _ri_ datta states that the rule given here in the G _ri_\nhya-sutra refers to the seventh year after birth. In the Dharma-sutra (comp.\n\xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 18) it is stated that the initiation of a Brahma _n_ a shall\ntake place in the eighth year after his conception.
