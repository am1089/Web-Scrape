On the day on which, beginning the study of the whole sacred science, the\nUpanishads (and the rest, he performs the Upakarma in the morning) he shall\nnot study (at night). 1\n\n2\\. And he shall not leave his teacher at once after having studied (the Veda\nand having returned home) 2\n\np. 112\n\n3\\. If he is in a hurry to go, he shall perform the daily recitation of the\nVeda in the presence of his teacher, and then go at his pleasure. In this\nmanner good fortune will attend both of them.\n\n4\\. If the (former) teacher visits him after he has returned home, he shall go\nout to meet him, embrace his (feet), and he shall not wash himself (after that\nact), showing disgust. He then shall let him pass first into the house, fetch\n(the materials necessary for a hospitable reception), and honour him according\nto the rule. 4\n\n5\\. If his former teacher is) present, he himself shall use a seat, a bed,\nfood, and garments inferior to, and lower (than those offered to the teacher.\n\n6\\. Standing (with his body bent), he shall place his left hand (under the\nwater-vessel, and bending with his other hand its mouth downwards), he shall\noffer to his teacher water for sipping. 6\n\n7\\. And (he shall offer water for sipping in this manner) to other guests also\nwho possess all (good qualities) together. 7\n\n8\\. He shall imitate (his teacher) in rising, sitting, walking, about, and\nsmiling. 8\n\np. 113\n\n9\\. In the presence (of his teacher) he shall not void excrements, discharge\nwind, speak aloud, laugh, spit, clean his teeth, blow his nose, frown, clap\nhis hands, nor snap his fingers.\n\n10\\. Nor shall he tenderly embrace or address caressing words to his wife or\nchildren.\n\n11\\. He shall not contradict his teacher,\n\n12\\. Nor any of his betters.\n\n13\\. (He shall not) blame or revile any creature. 13\n\n14\\. (He shall not revile one branch of) sacred learning by (invidiously\ncomparing it with) another. 14\n\n15\\. If he is not well versed in a (branch of) sacred learning (which he\nstudied formerly), he shall again go to the (same) teacher and master it,\nobserving the (same) rules as (during his first studentship).\n\n16\\. The restrictions (to be kept) by the teacher from the beginning of the\ncourse of teaching to its end are, to avoid cutting the hair on the body,\npartaking of meat or of oblations to the Manes, and connection (with a woman).\n16\n\n17\\. Or (he may have conjugal intercourse) with his wife at the proper season.\n\n18\\. He shall be attentive in instructing his pupils in the sacred learning,\nin such a manner that they\n\np. 114\n\nmaster it, and in observing the restrictions (imposed upon householders during\ntheir teaching . He who acts thus, gains heavenly bliss for himself, his\ndescendants and ancestors.\n\n19\\. He who entirely avoids with mind, word, nose, eye, and ear the sensual\nobjects (such as are) enjoyed by the touch, the organ, or the stomach, gains\nimmortality.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[111:1](sbe0240.htm#fr_573) **5**. This rule refers to the Upakarma, to be\nperformed yearly by householders. In our days, too, the custom is observed,\nand the whole Brahminical community change on this occasion their _G_ envis or\nsacrificial cords in the month of Srava _n_ a. The adherents of the various\n_S_ akhas of the Vedas, however, perform the ceremony on different days.\nAccording to Haradatta, the Upanishads are named, in order to show that they\nare of the highest importance. See also _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a X, 3, 5, 12.\n\n[111:2](sbe0240.htm#fr_574) Others consider that this Sutra refers to the\nannual Upakarma of the householder. In that case the translation would be,\n\'And after having performed the Upakarma,\' &c. Probably \xc3\x82pastamba means to\ngive a general rule, applicable both to householders and to students who have\nreturned home.\n\n[112:4](sbe0240.htm#fr_575) \'Though he may suspect that the teacher had been\ndefiled by the touch of a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala or the like, still he shall not\nshow disgust nor wash himself.\'--Haradatta. Regarding the rule of receiving\nguests, see below, II, 4, 8, 6 seq.\n\n[112:6](sbe0240.htm#fr_576) According to Haradatta, the repetition of the word\na _k_ aryam, \'the teacher,\' in this Sutra, indicates that the rule holds good\nnot only when the teacher comes as a guest to his former pupil, but on every\noccasion when he receives water for sipping.\n\n[112:7](sbe0240.htm#fr_577) \'He is called samudeta, "possessed of all (good\nqualities) together," who is endowed with (good) birth, disposition,\nbehaviour, (great) learning, and a (venerable) age.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[112:8](sbe0240.htm#fr_578) The word syat is to be understood from Sutra 5.\n\n[113:13](sbe0240.htm#fr_579) Haradatta states that \'speaking evil\' is\nforbidden here once more in order that it should be particularly avoided.\n\n[113:14](sbe0240.htm#fr_580) \'For example, he shall not say, "The [_Ri_ _g_\n-veda](errata.htm#0) is sweet to the ear, the other Vedas grate on the ear,"\nor "the Taittiriya-veda is a _S_ akha consisting of leavings," or "the Brahma\n_n_ a proclaimed by Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya is of modern origin."\'--Haradatta. The\nsecond sentence refers to the story that Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya vomited the Black\nYa _g_ ur-veda, and his fellow-students, becoming partridges, picked it up.\nRegarding the third sentence, see Varttika on Pa _n_ ini IV, 3, 105, and Max\nMuller\'s History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, P. 363.\n\n[113:16](sbe0240.htm#fr_581) Weber, Ind.
