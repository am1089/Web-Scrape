Vyasa said :-- Thus arguing in his mind, S\xc2\x92ukracharya smilingly said to\nthe Daityas :-- O Daityas! what for have you all been cheated by Brihaspati,\nthe Guru of the Devas, in my guise.\n\n\n\n2\\. I am S\xc2\x92ukracharya; you are my disciples; this man is Brihaspati, wanting\nto serve the Gods. He has cheated you, there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n3\\. This vain villainous person has assumed my form; do not put the least\nfaith in his words. O Daityas! You are my disciples, follow unto me; leave\nthis Brihaspati, vain and arrogant.\n\n\n\n4\\. The Daityas, on hearing his words were struck with wonder at the\nresemblance of the two personages and came to the conclusion that \xc2\x93the person\njust come is the real S\xc2\x92ukracharya.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n5\\. Then Brihaspati, the false S\xc2\x92ukracharya explained to the Daityas in plain\nand enchanting words that \xc2\x93the second man just come is the Deva Guru\nBrihaspati; he has come here in my guise. His object is to cheat you.\n\n\n\n6\\. He has come here to cheat you and serve the purpose of the Devas; do not\nbelieve in his words.\n\n\n\n7\\. What knowledge I have acquired from the God S\xc2\x92ambhu, I am teaching it to\nyou; I will make you, no doubt, victorious in the battle with the Devas.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n8\\. Thus the Daityas, hearing the words of the false S\xc2\x92ukracharya, thought the\nfalse one to be real and placed implicit reliance in his words.\n\n\n\n9\\. The real S\xc2\x92ukracharya, then explained them as much as he could; but the\nDaityas, owing to the magic of the false S\xc2\x92ukracharya and to the wonderful\neffect of time, did not hear his words.\n\n\n\n10\\. The Daityas thus convinced said to the real S\xc2\x92ukracharya, \xc2\x93this man\nbefore us is our Guru for our welfare and enlightenment, he is the foremost\nreligious S\xc2\x92ukracharya; for ten years continuously he is giving us advices.\nYou are not our Guru; you appear fictitious and false; you better leave this\nplace and go away.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n11\\. The dull brained Daityas repeatedly told to S\xc2\x92ukracharya the reproachful\nwords and bowed down to the false S\xc2\x92ukracharya, and, saluting, him, gladly\nwelcomed him as their Guru.\n\n\n\np. 300\n\n\n\n12-14. The real S\xc2\x92ukracharya, seeing the Daityas exceedingly attached to\nBrihaspati, the Guru of the Devas, and deceived by his words, cursed them out\nof anger and said :--\xc2\x93As you have not taken my words though I have explained\neverything to you, you would lose your knowledge and get defeat.\n\n\n\n15\\. As you have shown disrespect towards me, you will get the fruits of it at\nan early date and will then understand the deceitful behaviours of that Deva\nGuru.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n16\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus saying S\xc2\x92ukracharya hurriedly went away, infuriated\nwith anger. Brihaspati was glad and remained there with his mind calm.\n\n\n\n17-19. Brihaspati then knowing the Daityas cursed by S\xc2\x92ukracharya, assumed his\nreal appearance, left that place, and hurriedly returned to Indra. He began to\nsay \xc2\x93I have undoubtedly succeeded in my undertaking; the Daityas have been\ncursed and left by me too. They are now helpless; so, O Good Suras! I have\nmade them cursed, you would better now try to fight with them.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n20-21. Indra heard their Guru and became very glad; all the other Devas were\nglad and worshipped him. They held another cabinet, secret council, how to\nfight with the Daityas; and, then, all uniting together marched out in battle\nagainst the Asuras.\n\n\n\n22\\. Seeing that the powerful Devas are marching towards them ready to fight\nand knowing their false Guru had fled, the Daityas became very anxious.\n\n\n\n23\\. They told each other :-- Alas! We were enchanted by the Devaguru; the\nhighsouled S\xc2\x92ukracharya angrily left us; now it is our incumbent duty to\nsatisfy him.\n\n\n\n24\\. That vicious, dirty inside and pure outside, hypocrite Pundit Deva Guru,\nwho used to go to his brother\xc2\x92s wife, has really cheated and has quitted us.\n\n\n\n25\\. What are we to do now? where to go? How to satiate now the anger of\nS\xc2\x92ukra so that he might be glad and help us.\n\n\n\n26\\. Thus pondering over they all unitedly, shuddering with fear, again went\nto S\xc2\x92ukracharya, keeping Prahlada in front of them.\n\n\n\n27\\. They all bowed down at the feet of their Guru; S\xc2\x92ukra remained silent;\nthen, bursting with anger and with eyes red, told them.\n\n\n\n28\\. You were all warned by me that you were being cheated by the Maya of\nBrihaspati; you did not take my word, as worth hearing, though unselfish, pure\nand leading to your welfare.\n\n\n\np. 301\n\n\n\n29\\. Rather you were influenced by him and infatuated with vanity, you\ninsulted me; now you will have to bear undoubtedly the effects of that Karma.\n\n\n\n30\\. You are now vitiated from the path of your welfare; go now where that\ndisguised cheat resides for the welfare of the Gods; know me not to be a cheat\nlike him.\n\n\n\n31\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! When S\xc2\x92ukra finished saying his uncertain words,\nPrahlada clasped his feet and began to say thus :--\n\n\n\n32\\. Prahlada said :-- O our Guru Bhargava! Today we have come to you in a\nvery distressed condition! O Omniscient! we are your disciples; we are your\ngood sons; you ought not to quit us.\n\n\n\n33\\. On your departure to get the Mantra, that hypocrite, vicious Brihaspati\ngetting the opportunity, assumed your false appearance and cheated us.\n\n\n\n34\\. Peaceful persons do not take any offence committed with ignorance; you\nknow everything; you know very well that our hearts are devoted to thee and to\nthee alone. There is no need of telling anything further to you.\n\n\n\n35\\. O Highly Intelligent One! By your Tapas, you know our inner minds and\nrelinquish your anger. The sages say that the anger of the saints is not\nlasting.\n\n\n\n36\\. O Muni! Water is naturally cool; when in contact with fire it gets hot;\nbut, when the heat is removed, it gets cold shortly after.\n\n\n\n37\\. O observer of good vows! Anger is like chandala; sages therefore quit it.\nOur prayer to you is that you leave your anger and be pleased with us.\n\n\n\n38\\. If you do not quit your anger and if you make us overpowered with grief\nand sorrow, O blessed one! We, being abandoned by you, will go down to the\nPatala.\n\n\n\n39\\. Vyasa said :-- Bhargava heard Prahlada\xc2\x92s words and, with his intuitioned\neye, came to see the proper state of affairs and was pleased and lovingly\nsaid.\n\n\n\n40\\. You will not have to fear nor to enter into the Patala. You are my\nYajamanas; I will certainly protect you all by my never failing Mantra power.\n\n\n\n41\\. O knower of religion! What Brahma of yore told me, I am now telling you\naccordingly. Hear my truthful words, leading to your welfare.\n\n\n\n42\\. Whatever is inevitable, doomed to pass, must come to pass, be it\nauspicious or inauspicious. No one is able in this world to go against the\ncurrent of Fate.\n\n\n\np. 302\n\n\n\n43\\. Under the influence of Time you are now deprived of strength, therefore\nyou will have to suffer defeat at the hands of the Devas and you will have to\ngo once to the Patala.\n\n\n\n44-45. Brahma said :-- When your time to enjoy the sovereignty of the Triloki\nhad come, you enjoyed the kingdoms of the Triloki with all its wealth and\npower. You attacked the Devas and, helped by Time, had been able to trample\nthem under your feet and held your sovereignty for full ten yugas and enjoyed\nthe pleasures without any hitch.\n\n\n\n46\\. You will regain this kingdom in the Savar _n_ ik manvantara. Then Bali\nwill come in your family as the grandson of Prahlada and will conquer the\nTriloki and will get name and fame throughout his kingdom.\n\n\n\n47-48. When the Lord of Vaikun _t_ ha had incarnated as Vamana and stolen away\nthe kingdom of Vali, then the Janardan Vi _sn_ u told Bali, the king of the\nDemons that \xc2\x93I have taken away your kingdom by pretext to serve the purpose of\nthe Gods; you will become Indra, no doubt, in the coming Savar _n_ ika\nmanvantara.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n49\\. Bhargava said :-- According to the sayings of S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan Hari, your\ngrandson Bali is now invisible to all creatures and is now passing away his\ntime, very much terror stricken.\n\n\n\n50-51. Being afraid of Indra, he is now staying in a lonely house as an ass.\nOne day Indra on seeing him enquired of him, in various ways, the cause of his\nassuming that ass-body.\n\n\n\n52\\. O Lord of the Daityas! You have always enjoyed pleasures of all the\nworld; you are the ruler of the Daityas; you ruled over all the worlds; do you\nnot feel shame now in thus assuming this ass body. The Lord of the Daityas,\nhearing him, spoke thus.\n\n\n\n53-54. O Indra, there is nothing to be sorry in these matters. When the most\npowerful Vi _sn_ u can assume fish and tortoise incarnations, then what wonder\nis there that I by virtue of the force of Time, am now staying as an ass? When\nyou had murdered a Brahma _n_ , you, too had hid yourself in the Manasa lake\nin the lotuses; similarly today distressed, I am staying here in this ass\nbody.\n\n\n\n55\\. O Indra! What sorrow or happiness can be to a person who is under the\ncontrol of Fate. To him everything is alike; for whatever the Time wishes, It\ncan act accordingly.\n\n\n\n56\\. Bhargava said to Prahlada! Both persons Bali and Indra got enlightenment\nat the mutual conversations; and they went away to their places at their own\nwill.\n\n\n\np. 303\n\n\n\n57\\. O Lord of the Asuras! I have narrated to you this story indicating how\npowerful is the Time. Know that the Devas and Daityas and all the human beings\nand this whole universe is under that Great Fate.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourteenth Chapter in the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000 verses on the Daityas getting back\ntheir S\xc2\x92ukracharya, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 15](bk04ch15.htm)\n\n'
