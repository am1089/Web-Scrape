The Gods, content,  \nBack to their heavenly mansions went.  \nAnd Vis'vamitra, pious-souled,  \nAmong the Brahman saints enrolled,  \nOn reverend Vas'ishtha pressed  \nThe honours due to holy guest.  \nSuccessful in his high pursuit,  \nThe sage, in penance resolute,  \nWalked in his pilgrim wanderings o'er  \nThe whole broad land from shore to shore.  \n'Twas thus the saint, O Raghu's son,  \nHis rank among the Brahmans won.  \nBest of all hermits, Prince, is he;  \nIn him incarnate Penance see.  \nFriend of the right, who shrinks from ill,  \nHeroic powers attend him still.'  \n\nThe Brahman, versed in ancient lore,  \nThus closed his tale, and said no more,  \nTo S'atananda Kus'ik's son  \nCried in delight, Well done! well done!  \nThen Janak, at the tale amazed,  \nSpoke thus with suppliant hands upraised:  \n'High fate is mine, O Sage, I deem,  \nAnd thanks I owe for bliss supreme,  \nThat thou and Raghu's children too  \nHave come my sacrifice to view.  \nTo look on thee with blessed eyes  \nExalts my soul and purifies.  \nYea, thus to see thee face to face  \nEnriches me with store of grace.  \nThy holy labours wrought of old,  \nAnd mighty penance, fully told,  \nRama and I with great delight  \nHave heard, O glorious Anchorite.  \nUnrivalled thine ascetic deeds:  \nThy might, O Saint, all might exceeds.  \nNo thought may scan, no limit bound  \nThe virtues that in thee are found.  \nThe story of thy wondrous fate  \nMy thirsty ears can never sate.  \nThe hour of evening rites is near:  \nThe sun declines in swift career.  \nAt early dawn, O Hermit, deign  \nTo let me see thy face again.  \nBest of ascetics, part in bliss:  \nDo thou thy servant now dismiss.'  \n\nThe saint approved, and glad and kind  \nDismissed the king with joyful mind  \nAround the sage King Janak went  \nWith priests and kinsmen reverent.  \nThen Vis'vamitra, honoured so,  \nBy those high-minded, rose to go,  \nAnd with the princes took his way  \nTo seek the lodging where they lay.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXVI.: Janak's Speech.](ry066.htm)\n\n"
