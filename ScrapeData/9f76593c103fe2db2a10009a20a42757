XXII, 22 1], 'In the priestly office (brahman) may the\nBrahma _n_ a be born, endowed with spiritual lustre (brahmavar _k_ asa):' on\nthe Brahma _n_ a he thereby bestows spiritual lustre, whence of old the Brahma\n_n_ a was born as one endowed with spiritual lustre 2.\n\n13:1:9:22\\. 'In the royal order may the Ra _g_ anya be born, heroic, skilled\nin archery, sure of his mark, and a mighty car-fighter:' on the Ra _g_ anya he\nthereby bestows the grandeur of heroism 3, whence of old the Ra _g_ anya was\nborn as one heroic, skilled in archery, certain of his mark, and a mighty car-\nfighter.\n\n13:1:9:33\\. 'The milch cow:' on the cow he thereby bestows milk; whence of old\nthe cow was born as one yielding milk.\n\n13:1:9:44\\. 'The draught ox:' on the ox he thereby bestows strength, whence of\nold the ox was born as a draught (animal).\n\n13:1:9:55\\. 'The swift racer:' on the horse he thereby bestows speed, whence\nof old the horse was born as a runner.\n\n13:1:9:66\\. 'The well-favoured woman:' on the woman\n\np. 295\n\nhe thereby bestows beautiful form, whence the beautiful maiden is apt to\nbecome dear (to men).\n\n13:1:9:77\\. 'The victorious warrior:' on the Ra _g_ anya he thereby bestows\nthe grandeur of victoriousness 1, whence of old the Ra _g_ anya was born as\none victorious.\n\n13:1:9:88\\. 'The blitheful youth:' he, indeed, is a blitheful (or, sociable)\nyouth who is in his prime of life; whence one who is in his prime of life is\napt to become dear to women.\n\n13:1:9:99\\. 'May a hero be born unto this Sacrificer!' on the Sacrificer's\nfamily he thereby bestows manly vigour, whence of old a hero was born to him\nwho had performed the (A _s_ vamedha) sacrifice.\n\n13:1:9:1010\\. 'May Par _g_ anya rain for us whensoever we list!'--where they\nperform this sacrifice, there Par _g_ anya, indeed, rains whenever they\nlist;--'may our fruit-bearing plants ripen!'--there the fruit-bearing plants\nindeed ripen where they perform this sacrifice;--'may security of possession\nbe assured for us!'--where they perform this sacrifice there security of\npossession indeed is assured; whence wherever they perform this (A _s_\nvamedha) sacrifice, security of possession becomes assured to the people.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[294:1](sbe44082.htm#fr_743) These formulas are muttered after the thirteen\nsamidhs have been put in the ukha, or fire-pan. See [p.\n290](sbe44080.htm#page_290), note [1](sbe44080.htm#fn_728).\n\n[294:2](sbe44082.htm#fr_744) 'Whence formerly a Brahma _n_ a was at once born\nas Brahmavar _k_ asin (whilst now he must study),' Delbruck, Altindische\nSyntax, p. 287. Perhaps, however, 'pura' has here (as it certainly has in the\nfollowing paragraphs) the force of 'agre'--at the beginning, from the first,\nfrom of old.\n\n[294:3](sbe44082.htm#fr_745) I take ' _s_ auryam mahimanam' here (and ' _g_\naitra _m_ mahimanam' in [paragraph 7](sbe44082.htm#13:1:9:7)) to stand in\napposition to one another, with something of the force of a compound word. See\nabove, [p. 66](sbe44023.htm#page_66), note [4](sbe44024.htm#fn_225).\n\n[295:1](sbe44082.htm#fr_746) See note 3, p. 294.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 2, 1. Second Adhyaya.
