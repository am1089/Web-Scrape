He desired, \'May I create offspring.\' He did penance a second time,\nhe created birds. He desired, \'May I create offspring.\' He did penance a third\ntime, he saw this speech of the consecrated, he spoke it. Then indeed did he\ncreate offspring. In that after undergoing penance he speaks the speech of the\nconsecrated, the sacrificer thus [1] creates offspring. If one who is\nconsecrated sees anything impure, the consecration departs from him; his dark\ncolour, his beauty goes away. \'Mind unbound; eye weak; sun best of lights; O\nconsecration, forsake me not\', he says, and consecration departs not from him,\nhis dark colour and his beauty go not away. If rain falls on one who is\nconsecrated, the heavenly waters if unappeased destroy his force, might,\nconsecration [2], and penance. \'Do ye flowing waters place might (in me),\nplace force, place might; do not destroy my consecration, nor my penance\', he\nsays; verily he places all that in himself; they do not destroy his force,\nmight, consecration, or penance. Agni is the divinity of the consecrated man,\nand he is concealed as it were from him, when he goes (out), and the Raksases\nare able to hurt him [3]. \'From good to better do thou advance; may Brhaspati\nbe thy forerunner\', he says. Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the\ngods; verily he grasps hold of him, and he brings him safely through. \'Here we\nhave come ( _a-idam_ ) to the place on earth for sacrifice to the gods\', he\nsays, for he comes to the place on earth for sacrifice, who sacrifices.\n\'Wherein aforetime all the gods rejoiced\', he says, for all the gods delight\nin it, in that the Brahmans so do. \'Accomplishing (the rite) with Rc, Saman,\nand Yajus\', he says, for he who sacrifices accomplishes (the rite) with Rc,\nSaman, and Yajus. \'Let us rejoice in fullness of wealth, in sustenance\', he\nsays; verily he invokes this blessing.\n\n### iii. 1. 2.\n\n\'This is thy Gayatri part\', say for me to Soma.  \n\'This is thy Tristubh, Jagati, part\', say for me to Soma.  \n\'Become lord of the Chandomas\', say for me to Soma.  \nHe who purchases King Soma after making it go to the world of lordship,\nbecomes lord of his own (people). The world of lordship of King Soma is the\nmetres; he should utter these verses before the purchase of Soma. It is to the\nworld of lordship that he makes it go when he buys (Soma) [1], and he becomes\nlord of his own. He, who knows the support of the Tanunaptra finds support.\nThe theologians say, \'They do not eat, nor offer; then where does the\nTanunaptra find support?\' \'In Prajapati, in the mind, he should reply. He\nshould smell at it thrice, (saying), \'In Prajapati thee, in the mind I offer\';\nthis indeed is the support of the Tanunaptra; he who knows thus finds support.\nHe who [2] knows the support of the Adhvaryu finds support. He should call (on\nthe Agnidhra) standing in the place without moving whence he is minded to\nsacrifice. This is the support of the Adhvaryu; he who knows thus finds\nsupport. If he were to sacrifice moving about, he would lose his support;\ntherefore he should sacrifice standing in the same place, for support. He who\nknows the possession of the Adhvaryu, becomes possessed (of what he needs).\nHis possession is the offering-spoon, his possession is the Vayu cup, his [3]\npossession is the beaker. If he were to call without holding the Vayu cup or\nthe beaker, he would lose his own; therefore he must hold it when he calls;\nverily he loses not his own. If he begins the litany without placing the\nSoma," the Soma is not supported, the Stoma is not supported, the hymns are\nnot supported, the sacrificer is not supported, the Adhvaryu is not supported.\nThe support of the Soma is the Vayu cup, the support of it is the beaker, (the\nsupport) of the Stoma is Soma, (the support) of the hymns is the Stoma. He\nshould grasp the cup or fill up the beaker, and then begin the litany; a\nsupport to the Soma he verily ( _eva_ ) gives, to the Stoma, to the hymns; the\nsacrificer finds support, the Adhvaryu finds support.\n\n### iii. 1. 3.\n\nThey gather together the sacrifice when (they gather the dust of) the foot-\nprint of the Soma cow; the oblation-holders are the mouth of the sacrifice;\nwhen they move forward the oblation-holders, then he should oil the axle with\nit; verily he extends the sacrifice in the mouth of the sacrifice. They lead\nAgni forward, they take the wife forward, and they make the carts follow\nafter. Now the altar of him (Agni) is deserted; he broods on it, and is liable\nto become terrible ( _rudr a_) [1], and lay to rest the offspring and cattle\nof the sacrificer. When they are leading northward the sacrificial animal over\nwhich the Apris have been said, he should take (from the altar the fire) for\ncooking it; verily he makes him share in it. The Ahavaniya is the sacrificer;\nif they take (the fire) for cooking the victim from the Ahavaniya, they tear\nthe sacrificer asunder; the fire should therefore be thus, or he should make\nit by friction, so that the sacrificer\'s body may remain together. If a\nportion of the victim be lost, he should cut off an equivalent portion of the\nbutter; that is then the atonement. If men disturb his victim and he wish of\nthem, \'May they come to ruin\', he should make an offering in the Agnidh\'s\naltar with the Rc containing the word \'paying of homage\' (and beginning),\n\'What then?\' Verily he appropriates their paying of homage and speedily do\nthey go to ruin.\n\n### iii. 1. 4.\n\na The offspring, being born of Prajapati  \nAnd those that have been born,  \nTo him declare them;  \nLot the wise one reflect thereon.  \nb This victim, O lord of cattle, for thee to-day,  \nI bind, O Agni, in the midst of righteous action;  \nApprove it, and let us sacrifice with a good offering  \nMay this offering be welcome to the gods.  \nc The ancient wise ones grasp  \nThe breath as it speedeth from the limbs;  \nGo to heaven by the paths which lead to the gods;  \nBe among the plants with thy members.  \nd What cattle the lord of cattle ruleth [1],  \nBoth the four-footed and the two-footed,  \nMay he, bought off, go to his sacrificial share;  \nMay abundances of wealth fall to the sacrificer.  \ne Those, who being bound, contemplated  \nWith mind and with eye him who was being bound  \nLet the god Agni first release them,  \nLord of offspring, in harmony with offspring.  \nf The cattle of the forest, of all forms,  \nOf various forms, many of one form.  \nLet the god Vayu first release them,  \nLord of offspring, in harmony with offspring.  \ng Releasing [2] the seed of being,  \nDo ye further the sacrificer, O gods;  \nMay that which hath stood ready and strenuous,  \nGo alive to the place of the gods.  \nh The breath of the sacrificer is apart from the victim;  \nThe sacrifice goeth to the gods with the gods;  \nLet it go alive to the place of the gods;  \nFulfilled may the desires of the sacrificer be.  \ni If the victim has uttered a cry,  \nOr striketh its breast with its feet,  \nMay Agni release me from that sin,  \nFrom all misfortune.  \nk O ye slayers, come  \nTo the sacrifice [3] sped by the gods;  \nFree the victim from the noose,  \nThe lord of the sacrifice from the bond.  \nI May Aditi loosen this noose;  \nHomage to the cattle, to the lord of cattle, I pay;  \nI cast down the enemy;  \nOn him whom we hate I fasten the noose.  \nm Thee they keep to carry the offering,  \nTo cook (the victim) and as worthy of sacrifice;  \n0 Agni, with thy strength and thy body, be present  \nAnd accept our offerings, O Jatavedas.  \nn O Jatavedas, go with the caul to the gods,  \nFor thou art the first Hotr;  \nWith ghee do thou strengthen their bodies;  \nMay the gods eat the offering made with the cry of \'hail!  \no Hail to the gods; to the gods hail!\n\n### iii. 1. 5.\n\nCattle belong to Prajapati; their overlord is Rudra. In that he prepares\n(them) with these two (verses), verily by addressing him with them he secures\nhim, so that his self is not injured. He prepares (them) with two; the\nsacrificer has two feet; (verily it serves) for support. Having prepared them,\nhe offers five libations; cattle are fivefold; I verily he wins cattle. Now\nthe victim is led to death, and if he should lay hold on it, the sacrificer\nwould be likely to die. \' The breath of the sacrifice is apart from the\nvictim\', he says, for distinction [1]. \'If the victim has uttered a\ncry\'--(with these words) he offers a libation, for calming. \'O ye slayers,\ncome to the sacrifices\', he says; that is according to the text. When the\nomentum. is being taken, the strength goes away from Agni. \'Thee they keep to\ncarry the offering\'--(with these words) he pours a libation over the omentum;\nverily he wins the strength of Agni; (it serves) also for making (the victim)\nready. In the case of some gods the cry of \'hail!\' is uttered before (an\noffering), in the case of others the cry of \'hail!\' is uttered after. \'Hail to\nthe gods, to the gods hail!\'--(with these words) he pours a libation on either\nside of the omentum; verily he delights both (sets of gods).\n\n### iii. 1. 6.\n\na \'He who performs the sacrifice not according to the deities falls a victim\nto the deities, he becomes worse. He who (performs) in accordance with the\ndeities does not fall a victim to the deities, he becomes better. He should\nrub the Agnidh\'s place with a verse addressed to Agni, the oblation-holder\nwith one addressed to Visnu, the offering-spoons with one addressed to Agni,\nthe Vayu cups with one addressed to Vayu, the Sadas with one addressed to\nIndra. Thus he forms the sacrifice in accordance with the deities, he does not\nfall a victim to the deities, he becomes better.  \nb I yoke earth for thee with light, I yoke wind for thee with the atmosphere\n[1], I yoke speech for thee with the sun, I yoke the three spaces of the sun\nfor thee.  \nc Agni is the deity, Gayatri the metre, thou art the vessel of the silent\noffering. Soma is the deity, Tristubh the metre, thou art the vessel of the\nrestrained offering. Indra is the deity, Jagati the metre, thou art the vessel\nof Indra and Vayu. Brhaspati is the deity, Anustubh the metre, thou art the\nvessel of Mitra and Varuna. The A\xc3\xa7vins are the deity, Pa\xc3\xb1kti the metre, thou\nart the vessel of the A\xc3\xa7vins. Surya is the deity, Brhati the metre [2], thou\nart the vessel of the pure (Soma). Candramas is the deity, Satobrhati the\nmetre, thou art the vessel of the mixed (Soma). The All-gods are the deity,\nUsnih the metre, thou art the vessel of the opening offering. Indra is the\ndeity, Kakubh the metre, thou art the vessel of the hymns. Earth is the deity,\nViraj the metre, thou art the vessel of the reserved (offering).\n\n### iii. 1. 7.\n\nThe Adhvaryu is he that brings trouble on the sacrificer, and he that brings\ntrouble himself is ruined before the trouble. \'From the formula spoken, guard\nme, from every execration\'--(with these words) he should pour a libation\nbefore the morning litany (of the Hotr). So the Adhvaryu girds himself in\nfront with a protection, to avert trouble.\n\nFor entry thee, for rest thee, for the overcoming of the Gayatri, of the\nTristubh, of the Jagati, hail! O expiration and inspiration, protect me from\ndeath, O expiration and inspiration forsake me not.\n\nThey contend as to the deities and to expiration and inspiration [1], whose\nSoma (offerings) compete. \'For entry thee, for rest thee\', he says; entry and\nrest are the metres; verily by the metres he appropriates his metres. The Ajya\n(Stotras) have the word \'forward\' in them, for conquest. The beginning verses\nare addressed to the Maruts, for victory. Both the Brhat and the Rathantara\n(Samans) are used. The Rathantara is this (earth), the What yonder (sky);\nverily he cuts him off from these two. The Rathantara is to-day, the Brhat to-\nmorrow; verily he cuts him off from to-day and to-morrow. The Rathantara is\nthe past [2], the Brhat the future; verily he cuts him off from the past and\nthe future. The Rathantara is the measured, the Brhat the unmeasured; verily\nhe cuts him off from the measured and the unmeasured. Vi\xc3\xa7vamitra and Jamadagni\nhad a quarrel with Vasistha. Jamadagni saw this Vihavya (hymn), and by means\nof it he appropriated the power and strength of Vasistha. In that the Vihavya\nis recited, the sacrificer appropriates the power and strength of his enemy.\n\'He who performs more rites of sacrifice\', they say, \'appropriates the gods.\'\nIf the Soma (sacrifice) on the other side is an Agnistoma, he should perform\nan Ukthya; if it is an Ukthya, he should perform an Atiratra; verily by means\nof rites of sacrifice he appropriates his deities; he becomes better.\n\n### iii. 1. 8.\n\na Ye are the Nigrabhyas, heard by the gods. Delight my life, delight my\nexpiration, delight my inspiration, delight my cross-breathing, delight my\neye, delight my ear, delight my mind, delight my speech, delight my trunk,\ndelight my limbs, delight my offspring, delight my cattle, delight my house,\ndelight my troops, delight me with all my troops, delight me [1]; may my\ntroops not go thirsty.\n\nb The plants are the subjects of Soma; the subjects indeed are able to give up\nthe king; Soma is connected with Indra. \'I have made you grow in my mind, O ye\nwell born; O ye born of right, may we enjoy your favour; may the divine plants\nin accord with Indra grant us the Soma for the pressing\', he says verily\nhaving begged him from the plants, his subjects, and his deity he presses him.  \nc When the Soma is pressed [2] the first drop which falls has potency to\ndestroy the power, strength, offspring, and cattle of the sacrificer; he\nshould pronounce over it the formula, \'Thou hast fallen to me with offspring,\nwith abundance of wealth; destroy not my power and strength\'; verily he\ninvokes this blessing to prevent the destruction of his power, strength,\noffering, and cattle.\n\nd The drop hath fallen on the earth, the sky,  \nOn this seat and on the one which was aforetime  \nThe drop that wandereth over the third seat  \nI offer in the seven Hotras.\'\n\n### iii. 1. 9.\n\na He who bestows upon the gods the glory of the gods, and on men the glory of\nmen, has the divine glory among the gods, the human glory among men. The\nlibations which he draws off before the Agrayana libation, he should draw off\nsilently; those after with noise; verily he bestows upon the gods the glory of\nthe gods, and on men the glory of men; verily he has the divine glory among\nthe gods, the human glory among men.\n\nb May Agni protect us at the morning pressing,  \nHe that belongeth to all men, all-wealful in his might;  \nMay he, the purifier, grant us wealth [1];  \nMay we that share the draught be long-lived  \nc May the All-gods, the Maruts, Indra,  \nNot leave us at the second pressing;  \nLong-lived, speaking what is pleasing to them,  \nMay we enjoy the favour of the gods.  \nd This third libation belongeth to the sages  \nWho righteously set the beaker in motion;  \nMay these Saudhanvanas, who have attained heaven,  \nBear our good offering to what is better\n\ne Some libations have bases, some have not. Those which have a sprinkling have\nbases, those [2] of Soma have not bases. Taking (the cup) for Indra and Vayu\nhe should sprinkle it (saying), \'May the sacrifice be harmless for plants, for\nour cattle, for our folk; for all creatures harmless thou art; swell like\nghee, O god Soma.\' Verily so he makes the libations of Soma to have a base. He\nbecomes possessed of a base who knows thus. Verily also he wets with ghee the\nsky and earth: they being wet are to be lived upon; he is to be lived upon [3]\nwho knows thus.\n\nf This is thy share, O Rudra, for which thou didst ask; rejoice in it, find\n(for us) the lordship of cows, abundance of wealth, with good heroes and a\nyear\'s prosperity.\'\n\ng Manu divided his property among his sons. He deprived Nabhanedistha, who was\na student, of any portion. He went to him, and said, \'How hast thou deprived\nme of a portion?\' He replied, \'I have not deprived you of a portion; the\nAngirases here are performing a Sattra; they [4] cannot discern the world of\nheaven; declare this Brahmana to them; when they go to the, world of heaven\nthey will give thee their cattle.\' He told them it, and they when going to the\nworld of heaven gave him their cattle. Rudra approached him as he went about\nwith his cattle in the place of sacrifice, and said, \'These are my cattle.\' He\nreplied, \'They have given them [5] to me.\' They have not the power to do\nthat\', he replied, (whatever is left on the place of sacrifice is mine.\' Then\none should not resort to a place of sacrifice. He said, \'Give me a share in\nthe sacrifice, and I will not have designs against your cattle. He poured out\nfor him the remnants of the mixed (Soma). Then indeed had Rudra no designs\nagainst his cattle. When one who knows thus offers the remnants of the mixed\n(Soma), Rudra has no designs against his cattle.\n\n### iii. 1. 10.\n\na May I be pleasing to speech; pleasing to the lord of speech, O divine\nspeech. The sweetness of speech place in me; hail to Sarasvati.  \nb By the Rc make the Soma to prosper,  \nBy the Gayatra the Rathantara,  \nThe Brhat with the Gayatri for its metre.  \nc The drop that falleth of them, that shoot,  \nShaken by the arms, from the womb of the pressing-planks,  \nOr from the filter of the Adhvaryu,  \nOver it I say Hail! and offer it to Indra.  \nd The drop, the shoot, that hath fallen on the ground,  \nFrom the rice grains [1], the cake, the mush,  \nFrom the Soma with grain, from the mixed, O Indra, from the pure,  \nOver it I say Hail! and offer it to Indra.  \ne Thy sweet drop, powerful,  \nOver which Hail! is said and which goeth back to the gods  \nFrom the sky, the earth, the atmosphere  \nOver it I say Hail! and offer it to Indra.\n\nf The Adhvaryu is the first of the priests to start work, verily they say the\nStoma should be started by him.  \ng \'May speech that goes in front go in front, going straight to the gods,\nplacing glory in me, breath in cattle, offspring in me [2] and in the\nsacrificer\', he says; verily he yokes speech at the beginning of the\nsacrifice. The place of the sacrifice is made when having drawn off the\nlibations they creep to the Bahispavamana; for they go away, and they praise\nwith verses which go away; he returns, and with a verse addressed to Visnu\nreverences (the Soma); Visnu is the sacrifice; verily he makes the sacrifice.\n\'O Visnu, as our nearest, O mighty one, grant us protection; the streams\ndripping honey milk for thee the unfailing source\', he says; verily he makes\nto swell by it whatever of the Soma has dried up through lying (in the\nbarrels).\n\n### iii. i. 11.\n\na By Agni may one win wealth  \nAnd abundance day by day,  \nGlory, full of heroes.  \nb Rich in cattle, in sheep, O Agni, in horses is the sacrifice;  \nWith manly companions, ever unalterable;  \nRich in food is this, O Asura, in offspring,  \nEnduring, wealth, deep based and rich in houses.  \nC Swell up.  \nd Together for thee.  \ne Here Tvastr the first,  \nOf all forms, I call.  \nMay he be ours only.  \nf That procreant strength for us do thou,  \nO God Tvastr, graciously lot loose,  \nWhence is born a hero [1] of great deeds, of skill,  \nWho wieldeth the pressing-stone and loveth the gods.  \ng Come hither, O Tvastr, propitious,  \nPervasive for abundance, and of thy own will,  \nAid us in every sacrifice.,  \nh The hero is born, loving the gods,  \nOf brilliant hue, strong, and full of vigour;  \nTvastr accord us offspring and descendants;  \nMay he go to the place of the gods.  \ni Forth for us, O goddess.  \nk From the sky.  \nl May we milk offspring and food  \nFrom Sarasvant\'s breast,  \nSwelling for all to see [2].1  \nm May we enjoy the favour  \nOf thy waves, O Sarasvant,  \nWhich are full of honey and drip ghee.  \nn Let us call for aid on this Sarasvant,  \nWhose ordinance all cattle follow,  \nWhose ordinance the waters obey,  \nAnd in whose ordinance the lord of increase doth rest.  \no The divine, well-feathered bird, the great one,  \nGerm of the waters, male of the plants,  \nWho delighteth with rain from near,  \nThis Sarasvant let us call on for aid.  \np O Sinivali, with broad braids,  \nWho art the sister of the gods,  \nAccept the offering [3] which is made;  \nReveal, O goddess, offspring unto us.  \nq To her that hath fair hands, fair fingers,  \nProlific, and mother of many,  \nTo her the queen Sinivali,  \nPour the offering.  \nr Indra from all sides.  \ns Indra men.  \nt The dark-coloured steeds with fair feathers,  \nClad in the mist, spring up to the sky;  \nThey turn hitherward having established their abodes;  \nThen the earth is wet with ghee.  \nu He hath golden tresses in the expanse of the air,  \nA raging serpent like the rushing wind,  \nWith pure radiance [4], knowing the dawn,  \nLike true, glorious and toiling (women).  \nv Thy winged (steeds) have charged them as they are wont;  \nThe dark bull hath roared when this was;  \nHe hath come hither with (lightnings) that smile like kindly (women);  \nThe rains fall, the clouds thunder.  \nw Like a cow the lightning loweth;  \nIt tendeth its young like a mother,  \nWhen their rain hath been let loose.  \nx The mountain that hath waxed great is afraid  \nEven the ridge of heaven trembleth at your roaring;  \nWhen ye sport, O Maruts [5], with your spears,  \nYe speed along together like the waters.  \ny Roar and thunder, deposit a germ,  \nFly around with thy chariot water-laden;  \nDraw downward thy opened water-skin,  \nAnd let the heights and the depths be level.  \nz Even these immovable things (dost thou eat),  \nO Agni, like a beast at grass;  \nWhat time, O immortal, the hosts of thee,  \nThe strong, rend the woods.  \naa O Agni, many are the hosts of the immortal all-knower,  \nO God, powerful; and (many) the [6] wiles of the wily  \nWhich of yore they deposited in thee,  \nO thou that impellest all, O seeker of friends.  \nbb From the sky grant us rain, O ye Maruts;  \nMake ye to swell the streams of the strong steed  \nCome hither with this thunder,  \nPouring the waters, the Asura our father.  \ncc The bounteous Maruts make to swell the waters  \nWhich yield milk with ghee for the sacrifices;  \nThe strong steer they lead about as it were for rain;  \nThey milk the thundering and never-failing spring.  \ndd O ye Maruts, swimming in water, send forth  \nThe rain [7], which all the Maruts strengthen;  \nMay it call aloud like a maiden,  \nLike a wife with her husband in union.\n\nee With ghee anoint sky and earth, with honey;  \nMake the plants rich in milk, the waters;  \nMake to swell strength and goodwill,  \nWhen, O hero Maruts, ye pour the honey,  \nff Upwards that.  \ngg The radiant.  \nhh Like Aurva, like Bhrgu, like Apnavana,  \nI summon the pure  \nAgni who is clothed with the sea.  \nii As the impulse of Savitr,  \nThe favour of Bhaga, I call  \nAgni who is clothed with the sea.  \nkk I call the wise one, who soundeth like the wind,  \nThe might that roareth like Parjanya,  \nAgni who is clothed with the sea.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA II\n\n_\n\nThe Supplement to the Soma Sacrifice (continued)\n\n_\n\niii. 2. 1. He who sacrifices knowing the \'ascent\' verses of the Pavamana\n(Stotras) mounts on the Pavamanas and is not cut off from the Pavamanas. \'Thou\nart the hawk, with the Gayatri for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in\nsafety. Thou art the eagle, with the Tristubh for thy metre; I grasp thee;\nbring me over in safety. Thou art the vulture, with the Jagati for thy metre;\nI grasp thee; bring me over in safety\', he says. These [1] are the ascents of\nthe Pavamanas; he who knowing thus these sacrifices mounts on the Pavamanas,\nand is not cut off from the Pavamanas. He who knows the continuity of the\nPavamana lives all his days; he does not die before his time; be becomes rich\nin cattle; he obtains offspring. The Pavamana cups are drawn off, but these\nare not drawn off by him, the wooden vessel, the stirring-vessel, and the\nvessel which holds the purified Soma. If he were to begin (the Stotra) without\ndrawing them off, he would split the Pavamana [2], and with its being split\nthe breath of the Adhvaryu would be split. \'Thou art taken with a support; to\nPrajapati thee!\', (with these words) he should rub the wooden vessel; \'to\nIndra thee!\', (with these words) the stirring-vessel; \'to the All-gods thee!\',\n(with these words) the vessel which holds the purified Soma verily he renders\ncontinuous the Pavamana, he lives all his days; he does not die before his\ntime; he becomes rich in cattle; he obtains offspring.\n\n### iii. 2. 2.\n\nThere are three pressings. Now they spoil the third pressing if there are no\nstalks of the Soma in it. Having offered the silent cup, he puts a shoot in\nthe vessel which holds it, and placing it with the third pressing he should\npress it out. In that he makes it swell, it has a stalk (of the Soma); in that\nhe presses it out, it has the lees (of the Soma); verily he makes all the\npressings have stalks and pure Soma, and be of equal strength.\n\nTwo oceans are there extended, unperishing;  \nThey revolve in turns like the waves in the bosom of the sea;  \nSeeing they pass over one of them,  \nSeeing not [1] they pass over the other with a bridge.  \nTwo garments continuous one weareth;  \nWith locks, knowing all the worlds;  \nHe goeth in secret clad in the dark;  \nHe putteth on his bright robe abandoning that of the worn-out one.\n\nWhatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods saw this great\nsacrifice, they extended it, they performed the Agnihotra as the vow;\ntherefore one should perform the vow twice, for twice they offer the\nAgnihotra. They performed the full moon rite, as the animal sacrifice to Agni\nand Soma [2]. They performed the new moon rite, as the animal sacrifice to\nAgni. They performed the sacrifice to the All-gods as the morning pressing.\nThey performed the Varunapraghasas, as the midday pressing. They performed the\nSakamedhas, the sacrifice to the fathers, and the offering to Tryambaka, as\nthe third pressing. The Asuras sought to follow their sacrifice, but could not\nget on its tracks. They said, \'These gods have become inviolable (\n_adhvartavyah_ ). That is why the sacrifice ( _adhvara_ ) is inviolable. Then\nthe gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. He who knowing thus offers the\nSoma, prospers himself, the enemy is defeated.\n\n### iii. 2. 3.\n\na Surrounding Agni, surrounding Indra, surrounding the All-gods, surrounding\nme with splendour, be purified for us, with healing for cattle, healing for\nmen, healing for the horses, healing, O king, for the plants; may we possess\nthe abundance of wealth that is thine who art unbroken and of heroic power, O\nlord of wealth; of that give me, of that may I share, of that that is thine I\nprocure this.  \nb For my expiration, be purified, giving splendour, for splendour;  \nc For my inspiration;  \nd For my cross-breathing;  \ne For my speech [1];  \nf For my skill and strength;  \ng For my two eyes do ye be purified, giving splendour, for splendour;  \nh For my ear;  \ni For my trunk;  \nk For my members;  \nI For my life;  \nm For my strength  \nn Of Visnu,  \no Of Indra,  \np Of the All-gods thou art the belly, giving splendour to me, be purified for\nsplendour.  \nq Who art thou? (Thou art) who by name. To who ( _k asmai_) thee, to who ( _k\naya_) thee, thee whom I have delighted with Soma, thee whom I have gladdened\nwith Soma.

In that he recites sitting, therefore the gods live on that which is\ngiven hence; in that he responds standing, therefore men live on what is given\nthence. In that he recites seated towards the east, and he responds standing\ntowards the west, therefore seed is impregnated in front, offspring are born\nbehind.

So many are\nthe worlds of the gods; verily he conquers them. They make up ten; the Viraj\nhas ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj,\nthe eating of food.\n\n### iii. 3. 6.\n\nWhat the gods could not win by the sacrifice, that they won by the Para\n(Grahas), and that is why the Paras have their name. In that the Paras are\ndrawn, (it serves) to win that which one does not win by the sacrifice. The\nfirst he draws, by this he conquers the world; the second (he draws), by this\nhe conquers the atmosphere; the third (he draws), by this he conquers yonder\nworld. In that they are drawn, (they serve) to conquer these worlds [1]. In\nthe latter days they are drawn hitherward from yonder, verily having conquered\nthese worlds they descend again towards this world. In that in the former days\nthey are drawn thitherward from hence, therefore these worlds are thitherward\nfrom hence; in that in the latter days they are drawn hitherward from thence,\ntherefore these worlds are hitherward from thence; therefore men depend on the\nworlds in variation. The theologians say, \'For what reason do plants spring\nfrom the waters, the food of man is plants [2], and offspring are born through\nPrajapati?\' \'Through the Paras\', he should reply. In that he draws\n(saying),\'For the waters thee, for the plants I take\', therefore from the\nwaters plants spring; in that he draws (saying), \'For the plants thee, for\noffspring I take\', therefore the food of man is the plants; in that he draws\n(saying), \'For offspring thee, for Prajapati I take\', therefore through\nPrajapati offspring are born.\n\n### iii. 3. 7.\n\nPrajapati created the gods and the Asuras; thereafter the sacrifice was\ncreated, after the sacrifice the metres; they went away in all directions, the\nsacrifice went after the Asuras, the metres after the sacrifice; the gods\nreflected, \'These have become what we are\'; they had recourse to Prajapati;\nPrajapati said, \'Taking the strength of the metres I shall bestow it upon\nyou.\' He took the strength of the metres [1] and bestowed it upon them. Then\nthe metres ran away, and the sacrifice followed the metres. Then the gods\nprospered, the Asuras were defeated. He who knows the strength of the\nmetres--\'Do thou proclaim\', \'Be it proclaimed\', \'Utter\', \'We that utter\', the\nVasat call--prospers himself, his foe is defeated. The theologians say, \'For\nwhose gain does the Adhvaryu cause (him) to proclaim?\' \'For the strength of\nthe metres\', he should reply; \'Do thou proclaim\', \'Be it proclaimed\', \'Utter\',\n\'We that utter\', the Vasat call, that is the strength of the metres [2]; he\nwho knows thus sings what ever he sings with the metres in full strength. \'In\nthat Indra, slew Vrtra, there is impurity, in that he destroyed the Yatis,\nthere is impurity; then why is the sacrifice Indra\'s up to the completion?\'\nthey say. The sacrifice is the sacrificial body of Indra, and it is this they\nsacrifice. To him who knows thus the sacrifice resorts.\n\n### iii. 3. 8.\n\na Giving life, O Agni, rejoicing in the oblation,  \nBe thou faced with ghee and with thy birthplace of ghee;  \nHaving drunk the ghee, the sweet, the delightful product of the cow,  \nAs a father his son, do thou protect him.\n\nThe sacrificer falls a victim to the two fires in that having made (the\noffering) ready in them he goes elsewhere to the final bath; \'Giving life, O\nAgni, rejoicing in the oblation\', (with these words) should he offer when\nabout to go to the final bath; verily by the offering he appeases the two\n(fires); the sacrificer does not go to destruction.\n\nb That loan which I have not yet paid back [1],  \nThe tribute that I still owe to Yama,  \nHere do I make requital for it;  \nHere, O Agni, may I be freed from that debt.  \nc O Vi\xc3\xa7valopa, I offer thee in the mouth of the burner of all;  \nOne is an eater of the uneaten, one an eater of the unoffered, one an eater of\nthat which is gathered;  \nMay they make for us medicine,  \nAn abode, delightful strength.\'  \nd May he that fatteneth protect us  \nFrom in front with the cloud  \nMany be our houses,  \nThat houses fail us not.  \ne Do thou [2], O lord of cloud,  \nBestow on us strength with kindliness;  \nReturn to us what is lost,  \nReturn wealth to us.  \nf O god that dost fatten, thou art a lord of a thousandfold prosperity; do\nthou give us increase of wealth unfailing, rich in heroes, prosperity abiding\nthrough the year.\n\nYama is Agni, Yama is this (earth); the sacrificer becomes under a debt to\nYama in that he strews the altar with plants; if he were to go away with out\nburning (them), they would drag him about bound by the neck [3] in yonder\nworld. In that he burns, (saying) \'The loan which I have not yet paid\', being\nhere, having made requital of the loan to Yama, he goes freed from the debt to\nthe world of heaven. If he does manifold things as it were, he should offer in\nthe forest (fire) groats with his hand; the forest (fire) is Agni Vai\xc3\xa7vanara;\nverily he appeases him. On the Ekastaka the divider of the days, he should\ncook a cake of four \xc3\x87aravas in size, and early with it should fire the\nthicket; if [4] it burns, it becomes a good season, if it does not burn, a bad\nseason. By this mode of prognostication the seers of old used to undertake a\nlong Sattra. He who knowing the seer, the hearer, the reciter, sacrifices, is\nunited in yonder world with what he has sacrificed and bestowed. The seer is\nAgni, the hearer is Vayu, the reciter Aditya; he, who offers knowing thus to\nthem, in yonder world is united with what be has sacrificed and bestowed. \'May\nhe from in front with the cloud\' [5], he says; (he that is) from in front with\nthe cloud is Agni; verily he says to Agni, \'Guard this for me.\' \'Do thou, O\nlord of cloud\', he says; the lord of cloud is Vayu; verily he says to Vayu,\n\'Guard this for me.\' \'O god, that dost fatten\', he says; the god that fattens\nis yonder Aditya; verily he says to Aditya, \'Guard this for me.\'\n\n_\n\nThe Special Animal Offerings\n\n_\n\n### iii. 3. 9.\n\na This young one I put around you,  \nPlaying with him that is dear do ye move;  \nAfflict us not in birth, O ye prosperous ones;  \nMay we rejoice in increase of wealth, in food.  \nb Homage to thy greatness, to thine eye,  \n0 father of the Maruts, that do I sing;  \nBe propitious, with a fair sacrifice may we offer;  \nBe this oblation acceptable to the gods.  \nc This was the bundle of the gods,  \nThe germ of the waters smeared upon the plants;  \nPusan chose a drop of Soma [1];  \nA great stone was there then for them.  \nd Father of calves, husband of cows,  \nAnd father too of great gulfs,  \nCalf, afterbirth, fresh milk, beestings,  \nClotted milk, curd, ghee is his seed.  \ne Thee the cows chose for lordship,  \nThee the Maruts, sweet singers, bailed;  \nResting on the summit, the pinnacle, of lordly power,  \nThen O dread one to us assign wealth.\n\nUnsuccessful is his animal offering for whom these (rites) are not performed;\nsuccessful is the offering of him for whom they are performed.\n\n### iii. 3. 10.\n\na Surya, the god, for those that sit in the sky, Dhatr for lordly power, Vayu\nfor offspring, Brhaspati for Prajapati offer thee radiant.  \nb Thee have I united with the gods,  \nWho hast a tawny embryo  \nAnd a womb of gold,  \nWhose limbs are uninjured.  \nc Bring near, O bringer,  \nRemove away, O remover,  \nO Indra Nardabuda,  \nWith the four quarters of the earth  \nDo thou bring near.  \nd I split apart thy urinator,  \nThy womb, the two groins, [1]  \nThe mother and the child,  \nThe embryo and the after-birth.  \ne Apart from thee let it be.

Now the Raksases\ninfest the victim if it being offered to one deity is greater (than normal);\n\'Thou who hast a tawny embryo\', he says; verily he sends it to the gods, to\nsmite away the Raksases. \'Bring near, O bringer\', he says [1]; verily with the\nholy power he brings it. \'I split apart thy urinator\', he says; that is\naccording to the text. \'The drop, far extending, of all forms\', he says; the\ndrop is offspring and cattle; verily with offspring and cattle he unites him.\nTo the sky the deficiency of the sacrifice goes, to the earth the redundancy;\nif he were not to appease it, the sacrificer would be ruined; \'May the two\ngreat ones, sky and earth, for us\' [2], he says; verily by means of sky and\nearth he appeases both the deficiency and the redundancy of the sacrifice; the\nsacrificer is not ruined.

Prajapati saw this (offering) to Agni on\neight potsherds, he offered it, and thereby he redeemed this (victim) from\nAgni. Therefore though sacrificing it to another god, still one should first\noffer on eight potsherds to Agni; verily redeeming it from Agni he offers it.\nBecause [1] Vayu blew (them apart), therefore is it connected with Vayu;\nbecause these two conceived, therefore is it connected with sky and earth;\nbecause Soma generated, and Agni swallowed, there fore is it connected with\nAgni and Soma; because when the two parted speech was uttered, therefore is it\nconnected with Sarasvati; because Prajapati redeemed it from Agni, therefore\nis it connected with Prajapati; the barren goat is connected with all the\ngods. To Vayu should he offer it who desires wealth. the swiftest deity is\nVayu; verily he has recourse to Vayu with his own share [2], and he causes him\nto attain wealth. To sky and earth should he offer it who in ploughing desires\nsupport; verily from the sky Parjanya rains for him, plants spring up in this\n(earth), his corn prospers. To Agni and Soma should he offer it who desires,\n\'May I be possessed of food, an eater of food\'; by Agni he wins food, by Soma\nthe eating of food; verily he becomes possessed of food, an eater of food. To\nSarasvati should he offer it who [3], being able to utter speech, cannot utter\nspeech; Sarasvati is speech; verily he has recourse to Sarasvati with her own\nshare, and she bestows speech upon him. To Prajapati should he offer it who\ndesires, \'May I gain that which has not been gained\'; all the deities are\nPrajapati; verily by the deities he gains what has not been gained. He brings\n(the victims) up with a verse ad dressed to Vayu; verily winning it from Vayu\nhe offers it. \'For intent thee, for desire thee!\' [4] he says; that is\naccording to the text. He offers with the sound _kikkita_ ; at the sound\n_kikkita_ the domestic animals stop, the wild run away. In that he offers with\nthe sound _kikkita_ , (it serves) to support domestic animals. He offers while\nthe circumambulation by fire is taking place; verily alive he sends it to the\nworld of heaven. \'Thou, the fourth, art the barren, the eager one\', he says;\nverily he sends it to the gods. \'Be the desires of the sacrificer fulfilled\',\nhe says; this is the desire [5] of the sacrificer that (the sacrifice) should\nproceed to its conclusion without injury. \'Thou art the goat, resting in\nwealth\', he says; verily in these worlds he makes it find support. \'In the sky\nbe thy great radiance\', he says; verily in the world of heaven he bestows\nlight upon him. \'Stretching the thread of the atmosphere do thou pursue the\nlight\', he says; verily he makes these worlds full of light for him. \'Weave ye\nwithout a flaw the work of the singers, [6], he says; whatever flaw is\ncommitted in the sacrifice, this serves to atone for it. \'Become Manu; produce\nthou the host divine\', he says; offspring are connected with Manu; verily he\nmakes them fit for food. \'Thou art the offering of mind\', he says, to make\n\'Godspeed\'. \'May we share thy limbs\', he says; verily he invokes this\nblessing. Of this (victim) there is one time unpropitious for sacrifice to the\ngods, when a cloud appears when it has been offered [7]; if a cloud should\nappear when it has been offered, he should either cast it into the waters or\neat it whole; if he were to cast it into the waters, he would con fuse the\nsacrifice; he should eat it whole; verily he bestows power upon himself. By\nthree people is this to be performed, him who performs a year-long Sattra, him\nwho offers with a thousand (gifts), and him who is a domestic sacrificer; with\nit let them sacrifice, for them is it fit.\n\n_\n\nThe Jaya, Abhyatana, and Rastrabhrt Offerings\n\n_\n\n### iii. 4. 4.\n\na Thought and thinking, intent and intention, known and knowledge, mind and\npower, the new and the full moon, the Brhat and the Rathantara.\n\nb Prajapati bestowed victories on Indra  \nThe strong, he who is dread in battle contest,  \nTo him all the people bowed in reverence,  \nFor he waxed dread, worthy of offering.\n\nThe gods and the Asuras were in conflict.

In that the All-gods\nbrought together (the materials), the Abhyatanas are connected with the All-\ngods; in that Prajapati bestowed the victories (Jayas), therefore the Jayas\nare connected with Prajapati [1]; in that they won the kingdom by the\nRastrabhrts, that is why the Rastrabhrts (supporters of the kingdom) have\ntheir name. The gods overpowered the Asuras with the Abhyatanas, conquered\nthem with the Jayas, and won the kingdom with the Rastrabhrts; in that the\ngods overpowered ( _abhy atanvata_) the Asuras with the Abhyatanas, that is\nwhy the Abhyatanas have their name; in that they conquered ( _a jayan_) them\nwith the Jayas, that is why the Jayas have their name; in that they won the\nkingdom with the Rastrabhrts, that is why the Rastrabhrts have their name.\nThen the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated.

These (offerings) also should he make who desires a\nvillage; the minor deities are the metres, a village is as it were the metres;\nverily by the metres he wins a village for him [2]. He puts Dhatr in the\nmiddle; verily he places him in the middle of a village. These (offerings)\nalso should he offer who is long ill; the minor deities are the metres, the\nmetres are unfavourable to him whose illness is long; verily by the metres he\nmakes him well. He puts Dhatr in the middle, it is not in order in the middle\nof him whose illness is long; verily thereby in the middle he puts (things) in\norder for him. These (offerings) also [3] should he offer to whom the\nsacrifice does not resort; the minor deities are the metres, the metres do not\nresort to him to whom the sacrifice does not resort. He puts Dhatr first;\nverily in his mouth he places the metres; the sacrifice resorts to him. These\n(offerings) also should he make who has sacrificed; the minor deities are the\nmetres, the metres of him who has sacrificed are worn out as it were. He puts\nDhatr last [4]; verily afterwards he wins for him metres unwearied; the next\nsacrifice resorts to him. These (offerings) should he make to whom wisdom does\nnot resort; the minor deities are the metres, the metres do not resort to him\nto whom wisdom does not resort. He puts Dhatr first; verily in his mouth he\nplaces the metres; wisdom resorts to him. These (offerings) also should he\nmake [5] who desires brilliance; the minor deities are the metres, brilliance\nis as it were the metres; verily by the metres he bestows brilliance upon him.\nThey are made in milk; verily he bestows brilliance upon him. He puts Dhatr in\nthe middle; verily he places him in the middle of brilliance. Anumati is the\nGayatri, Raka the Tristubh, Sinivali the Jagati, Kuhu the Anustubh, Dhatr the\nVasat call. Raka is the first fortnight, Kuhu the second, Sinivali the new\nmoon (night), Anumati the full moon (night), Dhatr the moon. The Vasus are\neight [6], the Gayatri has eight syllables; the Rudras are eleven, the\nTristubh has eleven syllables; the Adityas are twelve, the Jagati has twelve\nsyllables, the Anustubh is Prajapati, the Vasat call Dhatr. Thus indeed the\nminor deities are all the metres and all the gods and the Vasat call. If he\nwere to offer them all at once, they would be likely to burn him up; he should\noffer first two, and a third for Dhatr, and then offer likewise the last two;\nthus they do not burn him up, and for whatever desire they are offered that he\nobtains by them.\n\n### iii. 4. 10.\n\na O Vastospati, accept us;  \nBe of kind entrance for us and free from ill;  \nThat which we seek from thee, do thou accord us,  \nAnd health be thou for our bipeds, health for our quadrupeds.  \nb O Vastospati, may we be comrades of thee  \nIn a friendship, effectual, joyful, and proceeding well;  \nAid our wishes in peace, in action;  \nDo ye guard us ever with blessings.\n\nIn that evening and morning he offers the Agnihotra the sacrificer thus piles\nup the oblation bricks [1]; the bricks of him who has established a sacred\nfire are the days and nights; in that he offers evening and morning, verily he\nobtains the days and nights, and making them into bricks piles them up. He\noffers ten in the same place; the Viraj has ten syllables; verily having\nobtained the Viraj, he makes it into a brick and piles it up; verily in the\nViraj he obtains the sacrifice; the piling up must be repeated by him.\nTherefore that is the place of sacrifice where he advances having spent ten\n(nights); not suitable is the place where (he spends) less time than that [2]\nNow Vastospati is Rudra. If he were to go on without offering to Vastospati,\nthe fire becoming Rudra would leap after him and slay him; he offers to\nVastospati; verily with his own share he appeases him; the sacrificer does not\ncome to ruin. If he were to offer with the chariot yoked, that would be as\nwhen one offers an oblation on a place he has left; if he were to offer\nwithout the chariot being yoked, that would be as when one offers an oblation\nat rest; verily no offering would be made to Vastospati [3]. The right\n(animal) is yoked, the left not yoked, and thus he offers to Vastospati;\nverily he does both, and appeases him completely. If he were to offer with one\n(verse) he would make (it) a ladle offering; having pronounced the Puronuvakya\nhe offers with the Yajya, to win the gods. If he were to load (his cart) after\nthe offering, he would make Rudra enter his house. If he were to set out\nwithout extinguishing the smouldering embers, it would be like a con fusion of\nthe sacrifice or a burning. \'This is thy birthplace in season\', (with these\nwords) he places (the embers) on the kindling-sticks [4]; this is the\nbirthplace of Agni; verily he mounts it on its own birthplace. Now they say,\n\'If being placed on the kindling-sticks it should be lost, his fire would be\ndispersed, it would have to be piled up again. \'With thy body, O Agni, worthy\nof sacrifice, come hither and mount\', (with these words) he makes it mount on\nhimself; the birthplace of fire is the sacrificer; verily on its own\nbirthplace he causes it to mount.\n\n### iii. 4. 11.\n\na Long life thou givest, O Agni,  \nO god, to the giver,  \nSage, lord of the house, the youthful.  \nb Bearing the oblations, Agni, immortal, our father,  \nWide extending, widely refulgent, fair to see for us,  \nWith good household fire, do thou shine forth food,  \nMete out to uswards renown.  \nc O do thou, O Soma, will life for us,  \nThat we may not die,  \nThou that lovest praise, lord of the forest.  \nd Brahman of the gods, leader of poets,  \nSage of seers, bull of wild beasts,  \nEagle of vultures, axe of the forests,  \nSoma [1] goeth over the seive singing.  \ne With our hymns to-day we choose  \nThe god of all, the lord of the true,  \nSavitr of true instigation.  \nf Coming with true light,  \nPlacing the mortal and the immortal,  \nWith golden car Savitr  \nThe god advanceth gazing on the worlds.  \ng That Aditi may accord  \nTo our cattle, our men, our kine,  \nTo our offspring, Rudra\'s grace.  \nh Harm us not in our children, our descendants, nor in our life,  \nHarm us not in our cattle, in our horses [2]  \nSmite not in anger our heroes, O Rudra,  \nWith oblations let us serve thee with honour.  \ni Like watchful birds swimming in water,  \nLike the noises of the loud thundercloud,  \nLike joyous waves breaking forth from the mountains,  \nThe praises have lauded Brhaspati.  \nk With comrades shouting like swans,  \nCasting aside his stone-made fetters,  \nBrhaspati thundered towards the cows,  \nAnd praised and sang in celebration perceiving them.  \nl Hither, O Indra, enduring wealth [3],  \nVictorious, bearing all,  \nHighest for help, do thou bring.  \nm O thou much invoked, thou dost endure the foes;  \nBest be thy strength, thy gift here;  \nBring riches with thy right (hand), O Indra,  \nThou art the lord of rich rivers.  \nn Thou were born, in full size at once,  \nFor the drinking of (Soma) when pressed,  \nO Indra, O wise one, for pre-eminence.  \no Thou art mighty, O Indra, with holy power,  \nTo be adored at every pressing;  \nThou art an overthrower of men in every conflict,  \nAnd highest song [4], O lord of all the people.  \np The fame of Mitra, supporter of the people,  \nOf the god is eternal,  \nTrue, and most varied in fame.  \nq Mitra stirreth men, the wise one,  \nMitra supporteth earth and sky;  \nMitra regardeth men with unwinking (eye);  \nTo the true one, let us offer an oblation rich in ghee.  \nr Rich in food be that mortal, O Mitra,  \nWho, O Aditya, seeks to follow thy law;  \nAided by thee he is not slain nor oppressed;  \nAffliction cometh to him neither from near nor from afar.  \ns Whatever [5] law of thine, as men,  \nO god Varuna,  \nDay by day we transgress.  \nt Whatever wrong we mortals here do  \nAgainst the host divine,  \nWhatever breach of thy laws we make through lack of thought,  \nFor that sin, O god, harm us not.  \nu As gamesters cheat in dicing,  \nWhat we know in truth or what we know not,  \nAll that do thou, O god, loosen as it were,  \nAnd may we be dear to thee, O Varuna.\n\n## PRAPATHAKA V\n\n_\n\nMiscellaneous Supplements\n\n_\n\n### iii. 5. 1.\n\na Full behind, and full in front,  \nIn the middle hath she of the full moon been victorious;  \nIn her let the gods dwelling together  \nRejoice here in the highest firmament.  \nb The share that the gods dwelling together  \nIn greatness bestowed on thee, O new moon,  \n(Therewith) do thou fill our sacrifice, O thou of every boon  \nGrant us wealth of good heroes, O fortunate one.  \nc Holder and gatherer of riches,  \nClad in all rich forms,  \nGranting a thousandfold prosperity,  \nThe fortunate one hath come to us with radiance accordant [1].  \nd O Agni and Soma, the first in strength,  \nDo ye quicken the Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas here;  \nRejoice in him of the full moon in the midst,  \nYe that are made to grow by holy power, won by good deeds,  \nAnd allot to us wealth with heroes.\n\nThe Adityas and the Angirases piled up the fires, they desired to obtain the\nnew and the full moon (offerings); the Angirases offered the oblation, then\nthe Adityas saw these two offerings, and offered them; then they first grasped\nthe new and full moon (offerings) [2]. He who is commencing the new and full\nmoon (sacrifices) should first offer these two (offerings); verily straightway\nhe commences the new and full moon (sacrifices). The theologians say, \'He\nindeed would begin the new and full moon (sacrifices) who should know the\nnormal and reversed order\'. What follows on the new moon is the normal, what\nis after the full moon is the reversed order; if he were to begin the full\nmoon (offering) first, he would offer these two (libations) in reverse order;\nhe would waste away as the moon waned [3]; he should offer these libations to\nSarasvant and Sarasvati in front; Sarasvati is the new moon; verily he\ncommences them in normal order; he waxes as the moon waxes. He should offer\nfirst on eleven potsherds to Agni and Visnu, to Sarasvati an oblation, to\nSarasvant on twelve potsherds. In that it is (offered) to Agni, and the mouth\nof the sacrifice is Agni, verily he places in front prosperity and the mouth\nof the sacrifice; in that it is (offered) to Visnu, and Visnu is the\nsacrifice, verily commencing the sacrifice he continues it.
