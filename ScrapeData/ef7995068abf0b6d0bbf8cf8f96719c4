From thence the reward; on account of possibility.\n\nIt has been shown, for the purpose of giving rise to a desire for devout\nmeditation, that the soul in all its states is imperfect, while the Supreme\nPerson to be reached by it is free from imperfections, the owner of blessed\nqualities and higher than everything else. Being about to investigate the\nnature of meditation, the Sutrakara now declares that the meditating devotee\nreceives the reward of meditation, i.e. Release, which consists in attaining\nto the highest Person, from that highest Person only: and that analogously the\nrewards for all works prescribed by the Veda--whether to be enjoyed in this or\nthe next world--come from the highest Person only. The Sutra therefore says\ngenerally, 'from thence the reward.'--'Why so?'--'Because that only is\npossible.'\n\nFor it is he only--the all-knowing, all-powerful, supremely generous one--who\nbeing pleased by sacrifices, gifts, offerings, and the like, as well as by\npious meditation, is in a position to bestow the different forms of enjoyment\nin this and the heavenly world, and Release which consists in attaining to a\nnature like his own. For action which is non-intelligent and transitory is\nincapable of bringing about a result connected with a future time.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 38.
