Now when Pra _g_ apati, in creating living beings, created Agni,\nthe latter, as soon as born, sought to burn everything here: and so everybody\ntried to get out of his way 1. The creatures then existing sought to crush\nhim. Being unable to endure this, he went to man.\n\n2:3:3:22\\. He said, 'I cannot endure this: come, let me enter into thee!\nHaving reproduced me, maintain me; and as thou wilt reproduce and maintain me\nin this world, even so will I reproduce and maintain thee in yonder world!' He\n(man) replied, 'So be it.' And having reproduced him, he maintained him.\n\n2:3:3:33\\. Now when he establishes the two fires, he reproduces that (Agni);\nand having reproduced him, he maintains him; and as he reproduces and\nmaintains him in this world, even so does he (Agni) reproduce and maintain him\nin yonder world.\n\n2:3:3:44\\. One must not, therefore, remove it (the sacrificial fire from the\nhearth) prematurely, for too\n\np. 343\n\nsoon it languishes for him; and as it languishes for him too soon in this\nworld, even so does it languish for him too soon in yonder world: one must\nnot, therefore, remove it prematurely.\n\n2:3:3:55\\. And when he dies, and they place him on the (funeral) fire, then he\nis reproduced from out of the fire; and he (Agni) who heretofore was his son\n1, now becomes his father.\n\n2:3:3:66\\. Hence it has been said by the _Ri_ shis (Rig-veda I, 89, 9), 'A\nhundred autumns (may there he) before us, O gods, during which ye complete the\nlife-time of our bodies, during which sons become fathers! do not cut us off,\nmidway, from reaching the full term of life!' for he (Agni) who is the son,\nnow in his turn becomes the father: this, then, is why one must establish the\nfires.\n\n2:3:3:77\\. Now yonder burning (sun) doubtless is no other than Death; and\nbecause he is Death, therefore the creatures that are on this side of him die.\nBut those that are on the other side of him are the gods, and they are\ntherefore immortal. It is by the rays (or reins, thongs, ra _s_ mi) of that\n(sun) that all these creatures are attached to the vital airs (breaths or\nlife), and therefore the rays extend down to the vital airs.\n\n2:3:3:88\\. And the breath of whomsoever he (the sun) wishes he takes and\nrises, and that one dies. And whosoever goes to yonder world not having\nescaped that Death, him he causes to die again and again in yonder world, even\nas, in this world, one regards not him that is fettered, but puts him to death\nwhenever one wishes.\n\np. 344\n\n2:3:3:99\\. Now when, in the evening after sunset, he offers two libations,\nthen he firmly plants himself on that Death with those fore-feet of his; and\nwhen, in the morning before sunrise, he offers two libations, then he plants\nhimself on that Death with those hind-feet of his. And when he (the sun)\nrises, then, in rising, he takes him up and thus he (the sacrificer) escapes\nthat Death. This, then, is the release from death in the Agnihotra: and,\nverily, he who knows that release from death in the Agnihotra, is freed from\ndeath again and again.\n\n2:3:3:1010\\. What the arrow-head is to the arrow, that the Agnihotra is to\nsacrifices. For whither the head of the arrow flies, thither the whole arrow\nflies: and so are all his works of sacrifice freed by this (Agnihotra) from\nthat Death.\n\n2:3:3:1111\\. Now day and night, revolving, destroy (the fruit of) man's\nrighteousness in yonder world. But day and night are on this side (of the sun)\nfrom him (after he has gone up to heaven); and so day and night do not destroy\n(the fruit of) his righteousness.\n\n2:3:3:1212\\. And as, while standing inside a chariot, one would look down from\nabove on the revolving chariot-wheels, even so does he look down from on high\nupon day and night: and, verily, day and night destroy not the reward of him\nwho thus knows that release from day and night.\n\n2:3:3:1313\\. [The sacrificer] having gone round the \xc3\x82havaniya, (after\nentering) from the east 1, passes\n\np. 345\n\nbetween (it and) the Garhapatya (to his seat). For the gods do not know (this)\nman 1; but when he now passes by them between (the fires), they know him, and\nthink, 'This is he that now offers to us.' Moreover, Agni (the fire) is the\nrepeller of evil; and these two, the \xc3\x82havaniya and Garhapatya, repel the evil\nfrom him who passes between them; and the evil being repelled from him, he\nbecomes a very light in splendour and glory.\n\n2:3:3:1414\\. On the north side is the door of the Agnihotra 2: thus (he\napproaches it) as he would enter (a house) by a door. If, on the other hand,\nhe were to sit down after approaching from the south, it would be as if he\nwalked outside.\n\n2:3:3:1515\\. The Agnihotra, truly, is the ship (that sails) heavenwards. The\n\xc3\x82havaniya and Garhapatya are the two sides 3 of that same heavenward-bound\nship; and that milk-offerer is its steersman.\n\n2:3:3:1616\\. Now when he walks up towards the east, then he steers that (ship)\neastwards towards the\n\np. 346\n\nheavenly world, and he gains the heavenly world by it. When ascended from the\nnorth it makes him reach the heavenly world; but if one were to sit down in it\nafter entering from the south, it would be as if he tried to enter it after it\nhas put off and he were left behind and remained outside.\n\n2:3:3:1717\\. And again, the stick which he puts on the fire (corresponds to) a\nbrick, and the formula wherewith he offers is the Ya _g_ us-text wherewith he\nputs on that brick 1; and when the brick is put on, then a libation is made:\nhence those same libations of the Agnihotra are offered on his pile of bricks\n2.\n\n2:3:3:1818\\. The fire, assuredly, is Pra _g_ apati,--and Pra _g_ apati is the\nyear. Year after year, therefore, is his Agnihotra consummated with the piled-\nup fire-altar; and year after year does he obtain the piled-up fire altar,\nwhosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra.\n\n2:3:3:1919\\. Seven hundred and twenty eighties of _Ri_ k-verses (he should\nrecite at the Agnihotra in the course of a year). When he offers the Agnihotra\nin the morning and evening, then there are two libations: hence those\nlibations of his, in the course of a year, amount to--\n\n2:3:3:2020\\. Seven hundred and twenty. Thus, indeed, his Agnihotra is\naccomplished, year after year, with the great chant 3; and year after year\ndoes he obtain\n\np. 347\n\nthe great chant, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[342:1](sbe1250.htm#fr_774) Ity abilam asa, i.e. 'there was a (general rush)\nto a hole,' (or perhaps 'to the outlet.')\n\n[343:1](sbe1250.htm#fr_775) Viz. inasmuch as the householder, by the \xc3\x82dhana,\nproduces, generates Agni.\n\n[344:1](sbe1250.htm#fr_776) According to Katy. IV, 13, 12 [and Schol.], the\nhouseholder [after taking out the fires and performing his regular twilight\nadoration (sandhya), that is, muttering the Savitri, Rig-veda III, 62, 10 (see\n_S_ at. Br.

XX, 3, 7] passes between the\nGarhapatya and Dakshi _n_ a fires, or south of them, p. 345 [enters the\n\xc3\x82havaniya house by the east door], circumambulates the fire from right to left\n(apadakshi _n_ am), and sits down in his place (south of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire\nand altar). The same circumambulation is performed by the wife, who thereupon\nsits down in her place, south-west of the Garhapatya.\n\n[345:1](sbe1250.htm#fr_777) Or, 'the gods are not aware of (this) man' (na vai\ndeva manushya _m_ vidu _h_ ). The gods are supposed to be assembled around the\naltar; see I, 3, 3, 8.\n\n[345:2](sbe1250.htm#fr_778) I do not understand this, there being no door on\nthe north side of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire-house. According to the commentator this\npassage is directed against those who make the sacrificer betake himself to\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya from (or along) the south; and he quotes the words 'dakshi _n_\nena va' from Katyayana, apparently IV, 13, 12, where it is said that the\nsacrificer, in going to the \xc3\x82havaniya, has to pass between the two western\nfires, 'or south of them.'\n\n[345:3](sbe1250.htm#fr_779) 'Nauma _n_ _d_ e' ? according to the commentator =\nbhitti (the two walls or sides). The Petersb. Dict. proposes 'the two rudders\n(or oars).'\n\n[346:1](sbe1250.htm#fr_780) Viz. at the Agni _k_ ayana, or piling up of the\nbrick-altars at the Soma-sacrifice. As to the putting on of the stick, see II,\n3, i, 17. The Ka _n_ va text of the Va _g_. S. (but not that of the Brahm.)\ngives the formula 'Agni _g_ yotisha _m_ (Surya _g_ yotisha _m_ , in the\nmorning) tva vayumatim,' &c. See Katy. IV, 14, i3; 15, 9.\n\n[346:2](sbe1250.htm#fr_781) After the completion of the fifth, and last, layer\nof the brick-altar, oblations of various materials are made thereon;\nespecially the _S_ atarudriyahoma, consisting of 425 single oblations; _S_ at.\nBr.
