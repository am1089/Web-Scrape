The second son\nthought over the horoscope, and said to himself:\n\n"Alas! am I born to this only in the world? The sayings of my father never\nfailed. I have seen them prove true to the last word while he was living; and\nhow has he fixed my horoscope! \' **From my birth, poverty!** \' Nor is that my\nonly fate. \' **For ten years, imprisonment** \'--a fate harder than poverty;\nand what comes next? \' **Death on the seashore** \'; which means that I must\ndie away from home, far from friends and relatives on a sea-coast. Now comes\nthe most curious part of the horoscope, that I am to \' **have some happiness\nafterwards!** \' What this happiness is, is an enigma to me."\n\nThus thought he, and after all the funeral obsequies of his father were over,\ntook leave of his elder brother, and started for Benares. He went by the\nmiddle of the Deccan avoiding both the coasts, and went on journeying and\njourneying for weeks and months, till at last be reached the Vindhya\nmountains. While passing that desert he had to journey for a couple of days\nthrough a sandy plain, with no signs of life or vegetation. The little store\nof provision with which he was provided for a couple of days, at last was\nexhausted. The chombu, which he carried always full, filling it with the sweet\nwater from the flowing rivulet or plenteous tank, he had exhausted in the heat\nof the desert. There was not a morsel in his hand to eat; nor a drop of water\nto think. Turn his eyes wherever he might he found a vast desert, out of which\nhe saw no means of escape. Still he thought within himself, "Surely my\nfather\'s prophecy never proved untrue. I must survive this calamity to find my\ndeath on some sea-coast." So thought be, and this thought gave him strength of\nmind to walk fast and try to find a drop of water somewhere to slake his dry\nthroat.\n\nAt last he succeeded; heaven threw in his way a ruined well. He thought he\ncould collect some water if he let down his chombu with the string that he\nalways carried noosed to the neck of it. Accordingly he let it down; it went\nsome way and stopped, and the following words came from the well: "Oh, relieve\nme! I am the king of tigers, dying here of hunger. For the last three days I\nhave had nothing. Fortune has sent you here. If you assist me now you will\nfind a sure help in me throughout your life. Do not think that I am a beast of\nprey. When you have become my deliverer I will never touch you. Pray, kindly\nlift me up." Gangazara thought: "Shall I take him out or not? If I take him\nout he may make me the first morsel of his hungry mouth. No; that be will not\ndo. For my father\'s prophecy never came untrue. I must die on a sea-coast, and\nnot by a tiger." Thus thinking, he asked the tiger-king to hold tight to the\nvessel, which he accordingly did, and he lifted him up slowly. The tiger\nreached the top of the well and felt himself\' on safe ground. True to his\nword, he did no harm to Gangazara. On the other hand, he walked round his\npatron three times, and standing before him, humbly spoke the following words:\n\n"My life-giver, my benefactor! I shall never forget this day, when I regained\nmy life through your kind hands. In return for this kind assistance I pledge\nmy oath to stand by you in all calamities. Whenever you are in any difficulty\njust think of me. I am there with you ready to oblige you by all the means\nthat I can. To tell you briefly how I came in here: Three days ago I was\nroaming in yonder forest, when I saw a goldsmith passing through it. I chased\nhim. He, finding it impossible to escape my claws, jumped into this well, and\nis living to this moment in the very bottom of it. I also jumped in, but found\nmyself on the first ledge of the well; he is on the last and fourth ledge. In\nthe second lives a serpent half-famished with hunger. On the third lies a rat,\nalso half-famished, and when you again begin to draw water these may request\nyou first to release them. In the same way the goldsmith also may ask you. I\nbeg you, as your bosom friend, never assist that wretched man, though he is\nyour relation as a human being. Goldsmiths are never to be trusted. You can\nplace more faith in me, a tiger, though I feast sometimes upon men, in a\nserpent, whose sting makes your blood cold the very next moment, or in a rat,\nwhich does a thousand pieces of mischief in your house. But never trust a\ngoldsmith. Do not release him; and if you do, you shall surely repent of it\none day or other." Thus advising, the hungry tiger went away without waiting\nfor an answer.\n\nGangazara thought several times of the eloquent way in which the tiger spoke,\nand admired his fluency of speech. But still his thirst was not quenched. So\nhe let down his vessel again, which was now caught hold of by the serpent, who\naddressed him thus: "Oh, my protector! Lift me up. I am the king of serpents,\nand the son of Adisesha, who is now pining away in agony for my disappearance.\n\'Release me now. I shall ever remain your servant, remember your assistance,\nand help you throughout life in all possible ways. Oblige me: I am dying."\nGangazara, calling again to mind the " **death on the sea-shore** " of the\nprophecy lifted him up. He, like the tiger-king, walked round him thrice, and\nprostrating himself before him spoke thus: "Oh, my life - giver, my father,\nfor so I must call you, as you have given me another birth. I was three days\nago basking myself in the morning sun, when I saw a rat running before me. I\nchased him. He fell into this well. I followed him, but instead of falling on\nthe third storey where he is now lying, I fell into the second. I am going\naway now to see my father. Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of\nme. I will be there by your side to assist you by all possible means." So\nsaying, the Nagaraja glided away in zigzag movements, and was out of sight in\na moment.\n\nThe poor son of the Soothsayer, who was now almost dying of thirst, let down\nhis vessel for a third time. The rat caught hold of it, and without discussing\nhe lifted up the poor animal at once. But it would not go away without showing\nits gratitude: "Oh, life of my life! My benefactor! I am the king of rats.\nWhenever you are in any calamity just think of me. I will come to you, and\nassist you. My keen ears overheard all that the tiger-king told you about the\ngoldsmith, who is in the fourth storey. It is nothing but a sad truth that\ngoldsmiths ought never to be trusted. Therefore, never assist him as you have\ndone to us all. And if you do, you will suffer for it. I am hungry; let me go\nfor the present." Thus taking leave of his benefactor, the rat, too, ran away.\n\nGangazara for a while thought upon the repeated advice given by the three\nanimals about releasing the goldsmith: "What wrong would there be in my\nassisting him? Why should I not release him also?" So thinking to himself,\nGangazara let down the vessel again. The goldsmith caught hold of it, and\ndemanded help. \'the Soothsayer\'s son had no time to lose; he was himself dying\nof thirst. Therefore he lifted the goldsmith up, who now began his story.\n"Stop for a while," said Gangazara, and after quenching his thirst by letting\ndown his vessel for the fifth time, still fearing that some one might remain\nin the well and demand his assistance, he listened to the goldsmith, who began\nas follows: "My dear friend, my protector, what a deal of nonsense these\nbrutes have been talking to you about me; I am glad you have not followed\ntheir advice. I am just now dying of hunger. Permit me to go away. My name is\nManikkasari. I live in the East main street of Ujjaini, which is twenty kas to\nthe south of this place, and so lies on your way when you return from Benares.\nDo not forget to come to me and receive my kind remembrances of your\nassistance, on your way back to your country." So saying, the goldsmith took\nhis leave, and Gangazara also pursued his way north after the above\nadventures.\n\nHe reached Benares, and lived there for more than ten years, and quite forgot\nthe tiger, serpent, rat, and goldsmith. After ten years of religious life,\nthoughts of home and of his brother rushed into his mind. "I have secured\nenough merit now by my religious observances. Let me return home." Thus\nthought Gangazara within himself, and very soon he was on his way back to his\ncountry. Remembering the prophecy of his father he returned by the same way by\nwhich he went to Benares ten years before. While thus retracing his steps he\nreached the ruined well where he had released the three brute kings and the\ngoldsmith. At once the old recollections rushed into his mind, and he thought\nof the tiger to test his fidelity. Only a moment passed, and the tiger-king\ncame running before him carrying a large crown in his mouth, the glitter of\nthe diamonds of which for a time outshone even the bright rays of the sun. He\ndropped the crown at his life-giver\'s feet, and, putting aside all his pride,\nhumbled himself like a pet cat to the strokes of his protector, and began in\nthe following words: "My life-giver! How is it that you have forgotten me,\nyour poor servant, for such a long time? I am glad to find that I still occupy\na corner in your mind. I can never forget the day when I owed my life to your\nlotus hands. I have several jewels with me of little value. This crown, being\nthe best of all, I have brought here as a single ornament of great value,\nwhich you can carry with you and dispose of in your own country." Gangazara\nlooked at the crown, examined it over and over, counted and recounted the\ngems, and thought within himself that he would become the richest of men by\nseparating the diamonds and gold, and selling them in his own country. He took\nleave of the tiger-king, and after his disappearance thought of the kings of\nserpents and rats, who came in their turn with their presents, and after the\nusual greetings and exchange of words took their leave. Gangazara was\nextremely delighted at the faithfulness with which the brute beasts behaved,\nand went on his way to the south. While going along he spoke to himself thus:\n"These beasts have been very faithful in their assistance. Much more,\ntherefore, must Manikkasari be faithful. I do not want anything from him now.\nIf I take this crown with me as it is, it occupies much space in my bundle. It\nmay also excite the curiosity of some robbers on the way. I will go now to\nUjjaini on my way. Manikkasari requested me to see him without failure on my\nreturn journey. I shall do so, and request him to have the crown melted, the\ndiamonds and gold separated. He must do that kindness at least for me. I shall\nthen roll up these diamonds and gold ball in my rags, and wend my way\nhomewards." Thus thinking and thinking, he reached UJjjaini. At once he\ninquired for the house of his goldsmith friend, and found him without\ndifficulty. Manikkasari was extremely delighted to find on his threshold him\nwho ten years before, notwithstanding the advice repeatedly given him by the\nsage-looking tiger, serpent, and rat, had relieved him from the pit of death.\nGangazara at once showed him the crown that he received from the tiger-king;\ntold him how he got it, and requested his kind assistance to separate the gold\nand diamonds. Manikkasari agreed to do so, and meanwhile asked his friend to\nrest himself for a while to have his bath and meals; and Gangazara, who was\nvery observant of his religious ceremonies, went direct to the river to bathe.\n\nHow came the crown in the jaws of the tiger? The king of Ujjaini had a week\nbefore gone with all his hunters on a hunting expedition. All of a sudden the\ntiger-king started from the wood, seized the king, and vanished.\n\nWhen the king\'s attendants informed the prince about the death of his father\nhe wept and wailed, and gave notice that he would give half of his kingdom to\nany one who should bring him news about the murderer of his father. The\ngoldsmith knew full well that it was a tiger that killed the king, and not any\nhunter\'s hands, since he had heard from Gangazara how he obtained the crown.\nStill, he resolved to denounce Gangazara as the king\'s murderer, so, hiding\nthe crown under his garments, he flew to the palace. He went before the prince\nand informed him that the assassin was caught, and placed the crown before\nhim. The prince took it into his hands, examined it, and at once gave half the\nkingdom to Manikkasari, and then inquired about the murderer. "He is bathing\nin the river, and is of such and such appearance," was the reply. At once four\narmed soldiers flew to the river, and bound the poor Brahman hand and foot,\nwhile he, sitting in meditation, was without any knowledge of the fate that\nhung over him. They brought Gangazara to the presence of the prince, who\nturned his face away, from the supposed murderer, and asked his soldiers to\nthrow him into a dungeon. In a minute, without knowing the cause, the poor\nBrahman found himself in the dark dungeon.\n\nIt was a dark cellar underground, built with strong stone walls, into which\nany criminal guilty of a capital offence was ushered to breathe his last there\nwithout food and drink. Such was the cellar into which Gangazara was thrust.\nWhat were his thoughts when he reached that plate? "It is of, no use to accuse\neither the goldsmith or the prince now, We are all the children of fate. We\nmust obey her commands. This is but the first day of my father\'s prophecy, So\nfar his statement is true. But how am I going to pass ten years here? Perhaps\nwithout anything to sustain life I may drag on my existence for a day or two.\nBut how pass ten years? That cannot be, and I must die. Before death comes let\nme think of my faithful brute friends."\n\nSo pondered Gangazara in the dark cell underground, and at that moment thought\nof his three friends. The tiger-king, serpent-king, and rat-king assembled at\nonce with their armies at a garden near the dungeon, and for a while did not\nknow what to do. They held their council, and decided to make an underground\npassage from the inside of a ruined well to the dungeon. The rat raja issued\nan order at once to that effect to his army. They, with their teeth, bored the\nground a long way to the walls of the prison. After reaching it they found\nthat their teeth could not work on the hard stones. The bandicoots were then\nspecially ordered \'for the business; they, with their hard teeth, made a small\nslit in the wall for a rat to pass and repass without difficulty. Thus a\npassage was effected.\n\nThe rat raja entered first to condole with his protector on his misfortune,\nand undertook to supply his protector with provisions. "Whatever sweetmeats or\nbread are prepared in any house, one and all of you must try to bring whatever\nyou can to our benefactor. Whatever clothes you find hanging in a house, cut\ndown, dip the pieces in water, and bring the wet bits to our benefactor. He\nwill squeeze them and gather water for drink! and the bread and sweetmeats\nshall form his food." Having issued these orders, the king of the rats took\nleave of Gangazara. They, in obedience to their king\'s order, continued to\nsupply him with provisions and water.\n\nThe snake-king said: "I sincerely condole with you in your calamity; the\ntiger-king also fully sympathises with you, and wants me to tell you so, as he\ncannot drag his huge body here as we have done with our small ones. The king\nof the rats has promised to do his best to provide you with food. We would now\ndo what we can for your release. From this day we shall issue orders to our\narmies to oppress all the subjects of this kingdom. The deaths by snake-bite\nand tigers shall increase a hundredfold from this day, and day by day it shall\ncontinue to increase till your release. Whenever you hear people near you, you\nhad better bawl out so as to be heard by them: \'The wretched prince imprisoned\nme on the false charge of having killed his father, while it was a tiger that\nkilled him. From that day these calamities have broken out in his dominions.\nIf I were released I would save all by my powers of healing poisonous wounds\nand by incantations.\' Some one may report this to the king, and if he knows\nit, you will obtain your liberty." Thus comforting his protector in trouble,\nhe advised him to pluck up courage, and took leave of him. From that day\ntigers and serpents, acting under the orders of their kings, united in killing\nas many persons and cattle as possible. Every day people were carried away by\ntigers or bitten by serpents. Thus passed months and years. Gangazara sat in\nthe dark cellar, without the sun\'s light falling upon him, and feasted upon\nthe breadcrumbs and sweetmeats that the rats so kindly supplied him with.\nThese delicacies had completely changed his body into a red, stout, huge,\nunwieldy mass of flesh. Thus passed full ten years, as prophesied in the\nhoroscope.\n\nTen complete years rolled away in close imprisonment. On the last evening of\nthe tenth year one of the serpents got into the bed-chamber of the princess\nand sucked her life. She breathed her last. She was the only daughter of the\nking. The king at once sent for all the snake-bite curers. He promised half\nhis kingdom and his daughter\'s hand to him who would restore her to life. Now\na servant of the king who had several times overheard Gangazara\'s cries,\nreported the matter to him, The king at once ordered the cell to be examined.\nThere was the man sitting in it. How had he managed to live so long in the\ncell? Some whispered that he must be a divine being. Thus they discussed,\nwhile they brought Gangazara to the king.\n\nThe king no sooner saw Gangazara than he fell on the ground. He was struck by\nthe majesty and grandeur of his person. His ten years\' imprisonment in the\ndeep cell underground had given a sort of lustre to his body. His hair had\nfirst to be cut before his face could be seen. The king begged forgiveness for\nhis former fault, and requested him to revive his daughter.\n\n"Bring me within an hour all the corpses of men and cattle, dying and dead,\nthat remain unburnt or unburied within the range of your dominions; I shall\nrevive them all," were the only words that Gangazara spoke.\n\nCartloads of corpses of men and cattle began to come in every minute. Even\ngraves, it is said, were broken open, and corpses buried a day or two before\nwere taken out and sent for their revival. As soon as all were ready,\nGangazara took a vessel full of water and sprinkled it over them all, thinking\nonly of his snake-king and tiger-king. All rose up as if from deep slumber,\nand went to their respective homes. The princess, too, was restored to life.\nThe joy of the king knew no bounds. He cursed the day on which he imprisoned\nhim, blamed himself for having believed the \'word of a goldsmith, and offered\nhim the hand of his daughter and the whole kingdom, instead of half, as he\npromised. Gangazara would not accept anything, but asked the king to assemble\nall his subjects in a wood near the town, "I shall there call in all the\ntigers And serpents, and give them a general order."\n\nWhen the whole town was assembled, just at the dusk of evening, Gangazara sat\ndumb for a moment, and thought upon the Tiger King and the Serpent King, who\ncame with all their armies. People began to take to their heels at the sight\nof tigers. Gangazara assured them of safety, and stopped them.\n\nThe grey light of the evening, the pumpkin colour of Gangazara, the holy ashes\nscattered lavishly over his body, the tigers and, snakes humbling themselves\nat his feet, gave him the true majesty of the god Gangazara. For who else by a\nsingle word could thus command vast armies of tigers and serpents, said some\namong the people. "Care not for it; it may be by magic. That is not a great\nthing: That he revived cartloads of corpses shows him to be surely Gangazara,"\nsaid others.\n\n"Why should you, my children, thus trouble these poor subjects of Ujjaini?\nReply to me, and henceforth desist from your ravages." Thus said the\nSoothsayer\'s son, and, the following reply came from the king of the tigers:\n"Why should this base king imprison your honour, believing the mere word of a\ngoldsmith that your honour killed his father? All the hunters told him that\nhis father was carried away by a tiger. I was the messenger of death sent to\ndeal the blow on his neck. I did it, and gave the crown to your honour. The\nprince makes no inquiry, and at once imprisons your honour. How can we expect\njustice from such a stupid king as that? Unless he adopt a better standard of\njustice we will go on with our destruction."\n\nThe king heard, cursed the day on which he believed in the word of a\ngoldsmith, beat his head, tore his hair, wept and wailed for his crime, asked\na thousand pardons, and swore to rule in a just way from that day. The\nserpent-king and tiger-king also promised to observe their oath as long as\njustice prevailed, and took their leave. The goldsmith fled for his life. He\nwas caught by the soldiers of the king, and was pardoned by the generous\nGangazara, whose voice now reigned supreme. All returned to their homes.\n\nThe king again pressed Gangazara to accept the hand of his daughter. He agreed\nto do so, not then, but some time afterwards. He wished to go and see his\nelder brother first, and then to return and marry the princess. The king\nagreed; and Gangazara left the city that very day on his way home.\n\nIt so happened that unwittingly be took a wrong road, and had to pass near a\nsea-coast. His elder, brother was also on his way up to Benares by that very\nsame route. They met and recognised each other, even at a distance. They flew\ninto each other\'s arms. Both remained still for a time almost unconscious with\njoy. The pleasure of Gangazara was so great that he died of joy.\n\nThe elder brother was a devout worshipper of Ganesa. That was a Friday, a day\nvery sacred to that god. The elder brother took the corpse to the nearest\nGanesa temple and called upon him. The god came, and asked him what he wanted.\n"My poor brother is dead and gone; and this is his corpse. Kindly keep it in\nyour charge till I finish worshipping you. If I leave it anywhere else the\ndevils may snatch it, away when I am absent worshipping you; after finishing\nthe rites I shall burn him." Thus said the elder brother, and, giving the\ncorpse to the god Ganesa, he went to prepare himself for that deity\'s\nceremonials. Ganesa made over the corpse to his Ganas, asking them to watch\nover it carefully. But instead of that they devoured it.\n\nThe elder brother, after finishing the puja, demanded his brother\'s corpse of\nthe god. The god called his Ganas, who came to the front blinking, and fearing\nthe anger of their master. The god was greatly enraged. The elder brother was\nvery angry. When the corpse was not forthcoming he cuttingly remarked, "Is\nthis, after all, the return for my deep belief in you? You are unable even to\nreturn my brother\'s corpse." Ganesa was much ashamed at the remark. So he, by\nhis divine power, gave him a living Gangazara instead of the dead corpse. Thus\nwas the second son of the Soothsayer restored to life.\n\nThe brothers had a long talk about each other\'s adventures. They both went to\nUjjaini, where Ganganra married the princess, and succeeded to the throne of\nthat kingdom. He reigned for a long time, conferring several benefits upon his\nbrother. And so the horoscope was fully fulfilled.\n\n\n\n[![](tn/35.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/35.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Harisarman](ift12.htm)\n\n'
