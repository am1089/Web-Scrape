Repetition (of the mental functions of knowing, meditating, &c., is\nrequired) on account of the text giving instruction more than once.\n\nThe third adhyaya was taken up chiefly with a discussion of the means of\nknowledge as related to the higher and lower vidyas. In the fourth adhyaya we\nshall now discuss the fruits of knowledge, and as occasion suggests some other\ntopics also.--In the beginning, however, we shall carry on, in a few adhikara\n_n_ as, a special discussion connected with the means of knowledge. 'Verily\nthe Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be thought, to be reflected on' (B\n_ri_. Up. II, 4, 5); 'Let a wise Brahma _n_ a after he has discovered him\npractise wisdom' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 21); 'That it is which we must search\nout, that it is which we must try to understand' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7. 1).\n\nConcerning these and similar passages a doubt arises whether the mental action\nreferred to in them is to be performed once only or repeatedly.--Once only,\nthe purvapakshin says; as in the case of the praya _g_ a-offerings and the\nlike. For thereby the purpose of scripture is accomplished; while to practise\nrepetitions not demanded by scripture would be to accomplish what is not the\npurpose of scripture.--But passages have been quoted which teach repetition\n'it is to be heard, to be thought, to be reflected on,' &c.!--Let us then\nrepeat exactly as scripture says, i.e. let us hear the Self once, let us think\nit once, let us reflect on it once, and nothing more. But where scripture\nteaches something once only--viz. in such passages as 'He knows,' 'Let him\nmeditate,' &c.--no repetition has to be practised.--To this we reply as\n\np. 332\n\nfollows. Repetition is to be performed because scripture gives repeated\ninstruction. For the repeated instruction contained in passages such as 'He is\nto be heard, to be thought, to be reflected on' intimates the repetition of\nthe required mental acts.--But the purvapakshin has said above that the\nrepetition is to extend exactly to what scripture says and not to go further!\n--This is wrong, we reply, because all those mental activities have for their\nend intuition. For hearing and so on when repeated terminate in intuition, and\nthus subserve a seen purpose, just as the action of beating. &c., terminates\nin freeing the rice grains from their husks. Moreover also such terms as\n'meditating,' 'being devoted to,' and 'reflecting 'denote actions in which\nrepetition is implied as a quality. Thus we say in ordinary life that a person\n'is devoted' to a teacher or a king if he follows him with a mind steadily set\non him; and of a wife whose husband has gone on a journey we say that she\nthinks of him, only if she steadily remembers him with longing. And (that also\n'knowing' implies repetition, follows from the fact that) in the Vedanta-texts\nthe terms 'knowing' and 'meditating' are seen to be used one in the place of\nthe other. In some passages the term 'knowing' is used in the beginning and\nthe term 'meditating' in the end; thus e.g. 'He who knows what he knows is\nthus spoken of by me,' and: Teach me, sir, the deity which you meditate on' (\n_Kh_. Up. IV, 1, 4; 2, 2). In other places the text at first speaks of\n'meditating' and later on of 'knowing;' thus e.g. 'Let a man meditate on mind\nas Brahman,' and 'He who knows this shines and warms through his celebrity,\nfame, and glory of countenance' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 18, 1; 6).--From this it\nfollows that repetition has to be practised there also, where the text gives\ninstruction once only. Where, again, the text gives repeated instruction,\nrepeated performance of the mental acts is directly intimated.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 2](sbe38263.htm)\n\n"
