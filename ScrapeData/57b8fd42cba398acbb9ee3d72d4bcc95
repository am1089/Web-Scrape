And on account of desire, there is no regard to what is inferred (i.e.\nmatter).\n\nIn order that the individual soul which is enthralled by Nescience may operate\nas the cause of the world, it must needs be connected with non-sentient\nmatter, called by such names as pradhana, or anumanika (that which is\ninferred). For such is the condition for the creative energy of Brahma and\nsimilar beings. Our text, on the other hand, teaches that the creation of the\naggregate of sentient and non-sentient things results from the mere wish of a\nbeing free from all connexion with non-sentient matter, 'He desired, may I be\nmany, may I grow forth;' 'He sent forth all, whatever there is' (Taitt. Up.\nII, 6). We thus understand that that Self of bliss which sends forth the world\ndoes not require connexion with non-sentient matter called anumanika, and\nhence conclude that it is other than the individual soul.--A further reason is\nstated in the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 20.
