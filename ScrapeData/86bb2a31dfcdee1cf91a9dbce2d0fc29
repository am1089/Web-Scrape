Then Vidagdha _S_ akalya asked him 2: \'How many gods are there, O Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya?\' He replied with this very Nivid 3: \'As many as are mentioned in\nthe Nivid of the hymn of praise addressed to the Vi _s_ vedevas, viz. three\nand three hundred, three and three thousand 4.\'\n\n\'Yes,\' he said, and asked again: \'How many gods are there really, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya?\'\n\n\'Thirty-three,\' he said.\n\np. 140\n\n\'Yes,\' he said, and asked again: \'How many gods are there really, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya?\'\n\n\'Six,\' he said.\n\n\'Yes,\' he said, and asked again: \'How many gods are there really, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya?\'\n\n\'Three,\' he said.\n\n\'Yes,\' he said, and asked again: \'How many gods are there really, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya?\'\n\n\'Two,\' he said.\n\n\'Yes,\' he said, and asked again: \'How many gods are there really, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya?\'\n\n\'One and a half (adhyardha),\' he said.\n\n\'Yes,\' he said, and asked again: \'How many gods are there really, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya?\'\n\n\'One,\' he said.\n\n\'Yes,\' he said, and asked: \'Who are these three and three hundred, three and\nthree thousand?\'\n\n2\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'They are only the various powers of them, in\nreality there are only thirty-three gods 1.\'\n\nHe asked: \'Who are those thirty-three?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'The eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the twelve\n\xc3\x82dityas. They make thirty-one, and Indra and Pra _g_ apati make the thirty-\nthree 2.\'\n\n3\\. He asked: \'Who are the Vasus.\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'Agni (fire), P _ri_ thivi (earth), Vayu (air),\nAntariksha (sky), \xc3\x82ditya (sun), Dyu (heaven), _K_ andramas (moon), the\nNakshatras (stars), these are the Vasus, for in them all that dwells (this\nworld) 3 rests; and therefore they are called Vasus.\'\n\np. 141\n\n4\\. He asked: \'Who are the Rudras?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'These ten vital breaths (pra _n_ as, the senses,\ni.e. the five _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anendriyas, and the five karmendriyas), and \xc3\x82tman 1, as\nthe eleventh. When they depart from this mortal body, they make us cry\n(rodayanti), and because they make us cry, they are called Rudras.\'\n\n5\\. He asked: \'Who are the \xc3\x82dityas?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'The twelve months of the year, and they are\n\xc3\x82dityas, because they move along (yanti), taking up everything 2 (adadana _h_\n). Because they move along, taking up everything, therefore they are called\n\xc3\x82dityas.\'\n\n6\\. He asked: \'And who is Indra, and who is Pra _g_ apati?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'Indra is thunder, Pra _g_ apati is the\nsacrifice.\'\n\nHe asked: \'And what is the thunder?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'The thunderbolt.\'\n\nHe asked: \'And what is the sacrifice?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'The (sacrificial) animals.\'\n\n7\\. He asked: \'Who are the six?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'Agni (fire), P _ri_ thivi (earth), Vayu (air),\nAntariksha (sky), \xc3\x82ditya (sun), Dyu (heaven), they are the six, for they are\nall 3 this, the six.\'\n\n8\\. He asked: \'Who are the three gods?\'\n\np. 142\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'These three worlds, for in them all these gods\nexist.\'\n\nHe asked: \'Who are the two gods?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'Food and breath.\'\n\nHe asked: \'Who is the one god and a half?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'He that blows.\'\n\n9\\. Here they say: \'How is it that he who blows like one only, should be\ncalled one and a half (adhyardha)?\' And the answer is: \'Because, when the wind\nwas blowing, everything grew (adhyardhnot).\'\n\nHe asked: \'Who is the one god?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'Breath (pra _n_ a), and he is Brahman (the\nSutratman), and they call him That (tyad).\'\n\n10\\. _S_ akalya said 1: \'Whosoever knows that person (or god) whose dwelling\n(body) is the earth, whose sight (world) is fire 2, whose mind is light,--the\nprinciple\n\np. 143\n\nof every (living) self, he indeed is a teacher, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'I know that person, the principle of every self, of\nwhom thou speakest.

The shadowy 2 person, "he is he." But tell me, _S_\nakalya, who is his devata?\'\n\n_S_ akalya replied: \'Death.\'\n\n15\\. _S_ akalya said: \'Whosoever knows that person whose dwelling are (bright)\ncolours, whose sight is the eye, whose mind is light,--the principle of every\nself, he indeed is a teacher, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'I know that person, the principle of every self,\nof whom thou speakest.

Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'O Ahallika 1, when you think the heart could be\nanywhere else away from us, if it were away from us, the dogs might eat it, or\nthe birds tear it.\'\n\n26\\. _S_ akalya said: \'And in what dost thou (thy body) and the Self (thy\nheart) abide?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'In the Pra _n_ a (breath).\'\n\n_S_ akalya said: \'In what does the Pra _n_ a abide?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: In the Apana (down-breathing) 2.\'\n\n_S_ akalya said: \'In what does the Apana abide?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'In the Vyana (back-breathing ) 3.\'\n\n_S_ akalya said: \'In what does the Vyana-abide?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'In the Udana (the out-breathing) 4.\'\n\n_S_ akalya said: \'In what does the Udana abide?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'In the Samana 5. That Self\n\np. 149\n\n[paragraph continues] (atman) is to be described by No, no 1! He is\nincomprehensible, for he cannot be (is not) comprehended; he is imperishable,\nfor he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself;\nunfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail.\'\n\n\'These are the eight abodes (the earth, &c.), the eight worlds (fire, &c.),\nthe eight gods (the immortal food, &c.), the eight persons (the corporeal,\n&c.) He who after dividing and uniting these persons 2, went beyond (the\nSamana), that person, taught in the Upanishads, I now ask thee (to teach me).\nIf thou shalt not explain him to me, thy head will fall.\'\n\n_S_ akalya did not know him, and his head fell, nay, thieves took away his\nbones, mistaking them for something else.\n\n27\\. Then Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'Reverend Brahma _n_ as, whosoever among\nyou desires to do so, may now question me. Or question me, all of you. Or\nwhosoever among you desires it, I shall question him, or I shall question all\nof you.\n\nBut those Brahma _n_ as durst not (say anything).\n\n28\\. Then Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya questioned them with these _S_ lokas:\n\n1\\. \'As a mighty tree in the forest, so in truth is man, his hairs are the\nleaves, his outer skin is the bark.\n\n2\\. \'From his skin flows forth blood, sap from the skin (of the tree); and\nthus from the wounded\n\np. 150\n\nman 1 comes forth blood, as from a tree that is struck.\n\n3\\. \'The lumps of his flesh are (in the tree) the layers of wood, the fibre is\nstrong like the tendons 2 . The bones are the (hard) wood within, the marrow\nis made like the marrow of the tree.\n\n4\\. \'But, while the tree, when felled, grows up again more young from the\nroot, from what root, tell me, does a mortal grow up, after he has been felled\nby death?\n\n5\\. \'Do not say, "from seed," for seed is produced from the living 3; but a\ntree, springing from a grain, clearly 4 rises again after death 5.\n\n6\\. \'If a tree is pulled up with the root, it will not grow again; from what\nroot then, tell me, does a mortal grow up, after he has been felled by death?\n\n7\\. \'Once born, he is not born (again); for who should create him again 6?\'\n\np. 151\n\n\'Brahman, who is knowledge and bliss, he is the principle, both to him who\ngives gifts 1, and also to him who stands firm, and knows.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[139:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_421) Madhyandina text, p. 1076.\n\n[139:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_422) This disputation between Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and\nVidagdha _S_ akalya occurs in a simpler form in the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a,\nXI, p. 873. He is here represented as the first who defies Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,\nand whom Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya asks at once, whether the other Brahmans had made\nhim the ulmukavakshaya _n_ a, the cat\'s paw, literally one who has to take a\nburning piece of wood out of the fire (ardha. dagdhakash _th_ am ulmukam;\ntasya vahirnirasanam avakshaya _n_ a _m_ vina _s_ a _h_ ). The end, however,\nis different, for on asking the nature of the one god, the Pra _n_ a, he is\ntold by Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya that he has asked for what he ought not to ask, and\nthat therefore he will die and thieves will carry away his bones.\n\n[139:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_423) Nivid, old and short invocations of the gods;\ndevatasa\xe1\xb9\x85khyava _k_ akani mantrapadni kani _k_ id vai _s_ vadeve _s_ astre _s_\nasyante. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, and Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga.\n\n[139:4](sbe15072.htm#fr_424) This would make 3306 devatas.\n\n[140:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_425) \'The glories of these are three and thirty.\'\nGough, p. 172.\n\n[140:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_426) Trayastri _m_ _s_ au, i.e. trayastri _m_ _s_ ata\n_h_ pura _n_ au.\n\n[140:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_427) The etymological explanation of Vasu is not quite\nclear, and p. 141 the commentator hardly explains our text. Perhaps vasu is\nmeant for the world or the dwellers therein. The more usual explanation occurs\nin the _S_ atap. Brah. p. 1077, ete hida _m_ sarva _m_ vasayante tadyad ida\n_m_ sarva _m_ vasayante tasmad vasava iti; or on p. 874, where we read te yad\nida _m_ sarvam &c.\n\n[141:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_428) \xc3\x82tman is here explained as manas, the common\nsensory.\n\n[141:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_429) The life of men, and the fruits of their work.\n\n[141:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_430) They are the thirty-three gods.\n\n[142:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_431) I prefer to attribute this to _S_ akalya, who is\nstill the questioner, and not Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya; but I am not quite satisfied\nthat I am right in this, or in the subsequent distribution of the parts,\nassigned to each speaker. If _S_ akalya is the questioner, then the sentence,\nveda va aha _m_ tam purusha _m_ sarvasyatmana _h_ paraya _n_ a _m_ yam attha,\nmust belong to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, because he refers to the words of another\nspeaker. Lastly, the sentence vadaiva has to be taken as addressed to _S_\nakalya. The commentator remarks that, he being the questioner, one expects pri\n_k_ _kh_ a instead of vada. But Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya may also be supposed to\nturn round on _S_ akalya and ask him a question in turn, more difficult than\nthe question addressed by _S_ akalya to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, and in that case\nthe last sentence must be taken as an answer, though an imperfect one, of _S_\nakalya\'s. The commentator seems to think that after Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya told\n_S_ akalya to ask this question, _S_ akalya was frightened and asked it, and\nthat then Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya answered in turn.\n\n[142:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_432) The Madhyandina text varies considerably. It has\nthe first time, _k_ ashur loka _h_ for agnir loka _h_. I keep to the same\nconstruction throughout, taking mano _g_ yoti _h_ , not as a compound, but\nlike agnir loko yasya, as a sentence, i.e. mano _g_ yotir yasya.\n\n[143:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_433) Ask me. Comm.\n\n[143:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_434) That from which he is produced, that is his\ndevata. Comm.\n\n[143:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_435) According to the commentator, the essence of\nfood, which produces blood, from which the germ receives life and becomes an\nembryo and a living being.\n\n[143:4](sbe15072.htm#fr_436) Because they excite the fire of love. Comm.\n\n[143:5](sbe15072.htm#fr_437) The commentator explains satya, the true, by the\neye, because the sun owes its origin to the eye.\n\n[144:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_438) Read _s_ rautra instead of _s_ rotra; see B _ri_\nh. \xc3\x82r. Up. II, 5, 6.\n\n[144:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_439) Shadow, _kh_ aya, is explained here by a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nana, ignorance, not by _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana, knowledge.\n\n[145:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_440) A\xe1\xb9\x85garavakshaya _n_ a is explained as a vessel in\nwhich coals are extinguished, and \xc3\x82nandagiri adds that Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, in\nsaying that _S_ akalya was made an a\xe1\xb9\x85garavakshaya _n_ a by his fellow\nBrahmans, meant that he was given up by them as a victim, in fact that he was\nbeing burnt or consumed by Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya. I should prefer to take\na\xe1\xb9\x85garavakshaya _n_ a in the sense of ulmukavakshaya _n_ a, an instrument with\nwhich one takes burning coals from the fire to extinguish them, a pair of\ntongs. Read sanda _m_ sa instead of sandesa. Kshi with ava means to remove, to\ntake away. We should call an a\xe1\xb9\x85garavakshaya _n_ a a cat\'s paw. The Brahma _n_\nas used _S_ akalya as a cat\'s paw.\n\n[145:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_441) It seems better to take kim as the interrogative\npronoun than as an interrogative particle.\n\n[146:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_442) Heart stands here for buddhi and manas together.\nComm.\n\n[146:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_443) In the text, published by Dr. Roer in the\nBibliotheca Indica, a sentence is left out, viz. h _ri_ daya ity uva _k_ a, h\n_ri_ dayena hi rupa _n_ i _g_ anati, h _ri_ daye hy eva rupa _n_ i pratish\n_th_ itani bhavantity.\n\n[147:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_444) Diksha is the initiatory rite for the Soma\nsacrifice. Having sacrificed with Soma which has to be bought, the sacrificer\nbecomes endowed with wisdom, and wanders to the North, which is the quarter of\nSoma.\n\n[148:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_445) A term of reproach, it may be a ghost or preta,\nbecause ahani liyate, it disappears by day.\n\n[148:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_446) Because the pra _n_ a would run away, if it were\nnot held back by the apana.\n\n[148:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_447) Because the apana would run down, and the pra _n_\na up, if they were not held back by the vyana.\n\n[148:4](sbe15072.htm#fr_448) Because all three, the pra _n_ a, apana, and\nvyana, would run away in all directions, if they were not fastened to the\nudana.\n\n[148:5](sbe15072.htm#fr_449) The Samana can hardly be meant here for one of\nthe five pra _n_ as, generally mentioned before the udana, but, as explained\nby Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga, stands for the Sutratman. This Sutratman abides in the\nAntaryamin, and this in the Brahman (Ku _t_ astha), which is p. 149 therefore\ndescribed next. Could Samana be here the same as in IV, 3, 7?\n\n[149:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_450) See before, II, 3, 6; also IV, 2, 4; IV, 4, 22;\nIV, 5, 115.\n\n[149:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_451) Dividing them according to the different abodes,\nworlds, and persons, and uniting them at last in the heart.\n\n[150:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_452) In the Madhyandina- _s_ akha, p. 1080, tasmat\ntadatunnat, instead of tasmat tadat _ri_ _n_ _n_ at.\n\n[150:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_453) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara seems to have read snavavat, instead\nof snava, tat sthiram, as we read in both _S_ akhas.\n\n[150:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_454) Here the Madhyandinas (p. 1080) add, _g_ ata eva\nna _g_ ayate, ko nv ena _m_ _g_ anayet puna _h_ , which the Ka _n_ vas place\nlater.\n\n[150:4](sbe15072.htm#fr_455) Instead of a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ asa, the Madhyandinas have\nanyata _h_.\n\n[150:5](sbe15072.htm#fr_456) The Madhyandinas have dhanaruha u vai, which is\nbetter than iva vai, the iva being, according to _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara\'s own confession,\nuseless. The thread of the argument does not seem to have been clearly\nperceived by the commentators. What the poet wants to say is, that a man,\nstruck down by death, does not come to life again from seed, because human\nseed comes from the living only, while trees, springing from grain, are seen\nto come to life after the tree (which yielded the grain or the seed) is dead.\nPretya-sambhava like pretya-bhava, means life after death, and pretyasambhava,\nas an adjective, means coming to life after death.\n\n[150:6](sbe15072.htm#fr_457) This line too is taken in a different sense by\nthe commentator. According to him, it would mean: \'If you say, He has been\nborn p. 151 (and there is an end of all questioning), I say, No; he is born\nagain, and the question is, How?\' This is much too artificial. The order of\nthe verses in the Madhyandina- _s_ akha is better on the whole, leading up\nmore naturally to the question, \'From what root then does a mortal grow up,\nafter he has been felled by death?\' When the Brahmans cannot answer, Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya answers, or the _S_ ruti declares, that the root from whence a\nmortal springs again, after death, is Brahman.\n\n[151:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_458) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains ratir datu _h_ as rater datu\n_h_ , a reading adopted by the Madhyandinas. He then arrives at the statement\nthat Brahman is the principle or the last source, also the root of a new life,\nboth for those who practise works and for those who, having relinquished\nworks, stand firm in knowledge. Regnaud (II, p. 138) translates: \'C\'est Brahma\n(qui est) l\'intelligence, le bonheur, la richesse, le but supreme de celui qui\noffre (des sacrifices), et de celui qui reside (en lui), de celui qui\nconnait.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1](sbe15073.htm)\n\n'
