He then offers the Rash _t_ rabh _ri_ t (realm-sustaining)\noblations;--the realm-sustainers, doubtless, are the kings, for it is they\nthat sustain realms. These deities, indeed, have been consecrated by this same\nconsecration ceremony by which he (the Sacrificer) is now to be consecrated:\nit is them he thereby gratifies, and thus gratified by offering, they grant\nhim permission (to perform) this consecration ceremony, and, permitted by\nthem, he is consecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow\n(to assume) the royal dignity, but not he whom they do not (allow to assume\nit). And inasmuch as the kings sustain realms, and these gods are kings,\ntherefore Realm-sustaining (oblations are performed).\n\n9:4:1:22\\. And, again, as to why he offers the Realm-sustaining (oblations).\nFrom Pra _g_ apati, when dismembered, couples went forth, in the form of\nGandharvas and Apsaras; and he, having turned into a chariot, enclosed them,\nand having enclosed them, he took them to himself and made them his own; and\nin like manner does this (Sacrificer), thereby enclosing them, take them to\nhimself and make them his own.\n\n9:4:1:33\\. Now that Pra _g_ apati who was dismembered, is this very Agni who\nis here being built up; and\n\np. 230\n\nthose couples which went forth from him, are these same deities to whom he now\nmakes offering.\n\n9:4:1:44\\. He makes offering to the Gandharvas and Apsaras, for in the form of\nGandharvas and Apsaras they went forth (from Pra _g_ apati). But the\nGandharvas and Apsaras also busy themselves with sweet scent (gandha) and\nbeauteous form (rupa 1), whence if any one goes to his mate he cultivates\nsweet scent and a beautiful appearance.\n\n9:4:1:55\\. He offers pairs (of oblations), for birth originates from a pair;\nand he alone is (ruler of) a kingdom who propagates offspring, but not he who\ndoes not propagate offspring. And inasmuch as couples sustain the realm, and\nthese deities consist of couples, these (oblations are called) Realm-\nsustainers. With ghee taken in twelve ladlings (he offers), and there are\ntwelve of these oblations: the significance of this has been explained.\n\n9:4:1:66\\. To the male (deity) he makes offering first, then to the females:\nhe thereby endows the male pre-eminently with power 2. To a single male he\nmakes offering, and to many females, whence even a single man has many wives.\nTo the male (deity) he makes offering both with the Vasha _t_ -call and the\nSvaha-call, to the female (deities) only with the Svaha: he thereby endows the\nmale pre-eminently with power.\n\n9:4:1:77\\. [He offers, with, Va _g_. S. XVIII, 38-43], 'The\n\np. 231\n\nlaw-upholding, law-abiding,'--that is, the truth-upholding, truth-\nabiding,--'Agni is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the plants,'--for as a\nGandharva, Agni, indeed, went forth with the plants as the Asparas, his\nmates,--'Delights (mud) by name,'--the plants are indeed delights, for\neverything here delights in plants--'may he protect this our priesthood and\nnobility: to him Hail! Va _t_! To them (fem.) Hail!' The meaning of this has\nbeen explained 1\n\n9:4:1:88\\. 'The Close-knit,'--yonder sun is indeed close-knit, for he knits\ntogether the days and nights;--'all-wealthy,'--for that (sun) indeed is every\nkind of wealth;--'Surya is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the sun-motes;'--for\nas a Gandharva, the sun, indeed, went forth with the sun-motes as the Apsaras,\nhis mates,--'Mobile (ayu) by name,'--for moving together 2, as it were, the\nsun-motes float;--'may he protect this our priesthood and nobility,'--the\nmeaning of this has been explained.\n\n9:4:1:99\\. 'The most blessed,'--that is, the most worthy of worship,--'sun-\nrayed,'--for like the sun's are the moon's rays;--' _K_ andramas (the\n\np. 232\n\nmoon) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the stars;'--for as a Gandharva the\nmoon, indeed, went forth with the stars as the Apsaras, his mates;--'Luminous\n(bhekuri) by name;'--light-giving (bhaku _ri_  1) these, indeed, are called,\nfor the stars give light;--'may he protect this our priesthood and nobility!'\nthe meaning of this has been explained.\n\n9:4:1:1010\\. 'The Agile,'--that is, the swift,--'all-expansive,'--for the wind\n(air), indeed, makes up all this expanse;--'Vata (the wind) is the Gandharva:\nhis Apsaras are the waters,'--for as a Gandharva the wind, indeed, went forth\nwith the waters as the Apsaras, his mates;--'Viands (ur _g_ ) by name,'--the\nwaters, indeed, are called 'ur _g_ a _h_ ,' for food is produced from the\nwaters;--'may he protect this our priesthood and nobility!' the meaning of\nthis has been explained.\n\n9:4:1:1111\\. 'The beneficent, well-winged,'--beneficent (bhu _g_ yu 2) indeed\nis the sacrifice, for the sacrifice benefits all beings,--'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (the\nsacrifice) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the offering-gifts,'--for as a\nGandharva the sacrifice, indeed, went forth, with the offering-gifts as the\nApsaras,\n\np. 233\n\nhis mates;--'Praises (stava) by name,'--the offering-gifts are indeed praises,\nfor the sacrifice is praised for offering-gifts; and whosoever gives an\noffering-gift (to priests) is praised;--'may he protect this our priesthood\nand nobility!' the meaning of this has been explained.\n\n9:4:1:1212\\. 'The lord of creatures, the all-worker,'--Pra _g_ apati (lord of\ncreatures) is indeed the all-worker, for he has wrought all this\n(universe);--'Manas (the mind) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the hymn-\nverses and hymn-tunes,'--as a Gandharva, the Mind indeed went forth, with the\nhymn-verses and hymn-tunes as the Apsaras, his mates;--'Wishes (esh _t_ i) by\nname,'--the hymn-verses and hymn-tunes are indeed wishes, for by verses and\ntunes people pray, 'May this accrue unto us! may it fare thus with us!'--'may\nhe protect this our priest and nobility!' 'the meaning of this has been\nexplained.\n\n9:4:1:1313\\. He then makes an offering on the Head of the Chariot;--this,\nindeed, is that very rite of consecration,--and by that he is now consecrated,\n--which this (Sacrificer) is permitted to perform by those deities with whose\npermission he is consecrated 1; for he alone becomes king whom the (other)\nkings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, and not he whom (they do) not\n(allow to assume it). With ghee taken in five ladlings (he offers), and this\nis offered as five oblations: the significance of this has been explained.\n\n9:4:1:1414\\. On the head (or front part of the chariot the\n\np. 234\n\noffering is made), for it is from the head (downwards) that he who is anointed\nis anointed,--whilst it is held above (the \xc3\x82havaniya), for above (others) is\nhe who is thus anointed;--with the same formula (repeated each time), for one\nand the same (person) is he who is thus anointed;--whilst taking round (the\nchariot-head) in every direction 1: on every side he thus is anointed.\n\n9:4:1:1515\\. And, again, as to why he makes offering on the head of the\nchariot;--it is because this chariot is yonder sun; for it was by assuming\nthat form that Pra _g_ apati enclosed those couples, and took them to himself,\nand made them his own; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby\nenclose them, and take them to himself, and make them his own. Whilst it (the\nchariot-head) is held above (the fire, he offers), for above (others) was he\nwho, enclosing those couples, took them to himself, and made them his\nown;--and with the same formula, for one and the same is he who, by enclosing\nthose couples, took them to himself, and made them his own.\n\n9:4:1:1616\\. [He offers each time, with, Va _g_. S. XVIII, 44], 'O Lord of the\nworld, Lord of creatures!'--for this (Agni), indeed, is the lord of the world,\nand the lord of creatures;--'thou whose dwellings are on high, or here below,'\n--both on high and\n\np. 235\n\nhere below, indeed, are his dwellings;--'to this priesthood and this nobility\nof ours,'--for this Agni is both the priesthood and the nobility,--'grant thou\nmighty protection, hail!'--that is, 'grant thou powerful protection!'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[230:1](sbe4339.htm#fr_395) This is apparently intended as an etymological\nexplanation of the two names; Apsaras being taken as derived from 'apsas,' in\nthe sense of 'beauty.' Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 135, note 3.\n\n[230:2](sbe4339.htm#fr_396) Or, perhaps, 'he places the male above (the\nfemale) in respect of power;' see [p. 133](sbe4327.htm#page_133), note\n[1](sbe4327.htm#fn_237).\n\n[231:1](sbe4339.htm#fr_397) In accordance with the preceding paragraph, that\npart of the formula which relates to the male deity, viz. 'The law-upholding,\nlaw-abiding Agni is the Gandharva--may he protect this our priesthood and\nnobility: to him Svaha! Va _t_!' is to be uttered first, and the first\noblation to be offered at the call 'Va _t_ ,' i.e. Vasha _t_ , 'may he (Agni)\ncarry it (to the gods)!' Then that part relating to the female deities is\nuttered, after which the second oblation is offered. In the same way the other\nfive formulas are to be treated. See Mahidhara's remarks on the present\nformula.\n\n[231:2](sbe4339.htm#fr_398) \xc3\x82-yuvana _h_ , literally 'holding to each other,'\na wrong etymology of 'ayu,' 'lively.'\n\n[232:1](sbe4339.htm#fr_399) This etymological explanation of 'bhekuri' is\ndoubtful.\n\n[232:2](sbe4339.htm#fr_400) The real meaning of bhu _g_ yu in this passage is\nvery doubtful; while it usually means 'flexible,' the St. Petersburg\nDictionary here tentatively assigns to it the meaning 'adder.' Whether the\nauthor of the Brahma _n_ a really connects it with 'bhu _g_ (bhunakti),' 'to\nenjoy, benefit' (instead of with 'bhu _g_ ,' 'to bend'); or whether the\nexplanation is merely meant as an etymological play of words, is not clear.\nMahidhara indeed derives it from the former root, in the sense of 'to\nprotect.' The order of the words 'ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ o vai bhu _g_ yu _h_ ' would\nproperly require to be rendered by--The 'bhu _g_ yu' doubtless is the\nsacrifice.\n\n[233:1](sbe4339.htm#fr_401) The construction of the text (occurring again at\n[IX, 4, 4, 8](sbe4342.htm#9:4:4:8)) is rather irregular.\n\n[234:1](sbe4339.htm#fr_402) The body (or 'nest,' seat-part) of the chariot is\nshifted sunwise round the fire on the great altar, so that the fore-part keeps\nover the fire where the Adhvaryu's assistant holds it, and in each of the four\ndirections, as well as in the centre of the fire, the Adhvaryu offers a\nlibation of ghee, whilst facing the chariot-head. According to a comment on\nthe respective rules (Katy. XVIII, 5, 17-20) alluded to by Prof. Weber (Ind.\nStud. XIII, p. 286), the fore-part of the chariot would, however, seem to be\ntaken off the seat-part; the latter being carried round the fire as the\noblations are made.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 4, 2.
