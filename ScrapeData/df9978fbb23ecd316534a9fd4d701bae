In the imperishable and infinite Highest Brahman 1, wherein the two,\nknowledge and ignorance, are hidden 2, the one, ignorance, perishes 3, the\nother, knowledge, is immortal; but he who controls both, knowledge and\nignorance, is another 4.\n\n2\\. It is he who, being one only, rules over every germ (cause), over all\nforms, and over all germs; it is he who, in the beginning, bears 5 in his\nthoughts the wise son, the fiery, whom he wishes to look on 6 while he is born\n7.\n\n3 8. In that field 9 in which the god, after spreading out one net after\nanother 10 in various ways, draws it together again, the Lord, the great Self\n11, having\n\np. 256\n\nfurther created the lords 1, thus carries on his lordship over all.\n\n4\\. As the car (of the sun) shines, lighting up all quarters, above, below,\nand across, thus does that god, the holy, the adorable, being one, rule over\nall that has the nature of a germ 2.\n\n5\\. He, being one, rules over all and everything, so that the universal germ\nripens its nature, diversifies all natures that can be ripened 3, and\ndetermines all qualities 4.\n\n6 5. Brahma (Hira _n_ yagarbha) knows this, which is hidden in the Upanishads,\nwhich are hidden in the Vedas, as the Brahma-germ. The ancient gods\n\np. 257\n\nand poets who knew it, they became it and were immortal.\n\n7 1. But he who is endowed with qualities, and performs works that are to bear\nfruit, and enjoys the reward of whatever he has done, migrates through his own\nworks, the lord of life, assuming all forms, led by the three Gu _n_ as, and\nfollowing the three paths 2.\n\n8 3. That lower one also, not larger than a thumb, but brilliant like the sun,\nwho is endowed with personality and thoughts, with the quality of mind and the\nquality of body, is seen small even like the point of a goad.\n\n9\\. That living soul is to be known as part of the hundredth part of the point\nof a hair 4, divided a hundred times, and yet it is to be infinite.\n\n10\\. It is not woman, it is not man, nor is it neuter; whatever body it takes,\nwith that it is joined 5 (only).\n\n11 6. By means of thoughts, touching, seeing, and\n\np. 258\n\npassions the incarnate Self assumes successively in various places various\nforms 1, in accordance with his deeds, just as the body grows when food and\ndrink are poured into it.\n\n12\\. That incarnate Self, according to his own qualities, chooses (assumes)\nmany shapes, coarse or subtile, and having himself caused his union with them,\nhe is seen as another and another 2, through the qualities of his acts, and\nthrough the qualities of his body.\n\n13 3. He who knows him who has no beginning and no end, in the midst of chaos,\ncreating all things, having many forms, alone enveloping everything, is freed\nfrom all fetters.\n\n14\\. Those who know him who is to be grasped by the mind, who is not to be\ncalled the nest (the body 4), who makes existence and non-existence, the\n\np. 259\n\nhappy one ( _S_ iva), who also creates the elements 1, they have left the\nbody.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[255:1](sbe15104.htm#fr_807) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains Brahmapare by brahma _n_ o\nhira _n_ yagarbhat pare, or by parasmin brahma _n_ i, which comes to the same.\nVi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman adds _kh_ andasa _h_ paranipata _h_. As the termination e\nmay belong to the locative singular or to the nom. dual, commentators vary in\nreferring some of the adjectives either to brahman or to vidyavidye.\n\n[255:2](sbe15104.htm#fr_808) Gu _dh_ e, lokair _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ atum a _s_ akye, _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85karananda.\n\n[255:3](sbe15104.htm#fr_809) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains ksharam, by sa _m_ _s_ _ri_\ntikara _n_ am, am _ri_ tam by mokshahetu _h_.\n\n[255:4](sbe15104.htm#fr_810) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains that he is different from\nthem, being only the sakshin, or witness. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda seems to have read\nSomya, i.e. Somavatpriyadar _s_ ana, as if _S_ veta _s_ vatvara addressed his\npupil.\n\n[255:5](sbe15104.htm#fr_811) Like a mother, see I, 9.\n\n[255:6](sbe15104.htm#fr_812) Like a father.\n\n[255:7](sbe15104.htm#fr_813) See on this verse the remarks made in the\nIntroduction.\n\n[255:8](sbe15104.htm#fr_814) The MSS. read yasmin for asmin, and patayas for\nyatayas, which the commentator explains by patin.\n\n[255:9](sbe15104.htm#fr_815) The world, or the mulaprak _ri_ ti, the net being\nthe sa _m_ sara.\n\n[255:10](sbe15104.htm#fr_816) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains ekaikam by pratyekam, i.e.\nfor every creature, such as gods, men, beasts, &c.\n\n[255:11](sbe15104.htm#fr_817) I doubt whether mahatma should be translated by\nthe great p. 256 Self, or whether great would not be sufficient. The whole\nverse is extremely difficult.\n\n[256:1](sbe15104.htm#fr_818) From Hira _n_ yagarbha to insects; or beginning\nwith Mari _k_ i.\n\n[256:2](sbe15104.htm#fr_819) Cf. IV, 11; V, 2.\n\n[256:3](sbe15104.htm#fr_820) MS. B. has pra _k_ yan, and explains it by\npurvotpannan.\n\n[256:4](sbe15104.htm#fr_821) This is again a very difficult verse. I have\ntaken vi _s_ vayoni _h_ as a name for Brahman, possessed of that devatma _s_\nakti which was mentioned before, but I feel by no means satisfied. The\ncommentators do not help, because they do not see the difficulty of the\nconstruction. If one might conjecture, I should prefer pa _k_ et for pa _k_\nati, and should write parinamayed yat, and viniyo _g_ ayed yat, unless we\nchanged ya _k_ _k_ a into ya _s_ _k_ a.\n\n[256:5](sbe15104.htm#fr_822) This verse admits of various translations, and\nrequires also some metrical emendations. Thus Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman explains\nvedaguhyopanishatsu very ingeniously by the Veda, i.e. that part of it which\nteaches sacrifices and their rewards; the Guhya, i.e. the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, which\nteaches the worship of Brahman under various legendary aspects; and the\nUpanishads, which teach the knowledge of Brahman without qualities. These\nthree divisions would correspond to the karmaka _n_ _d_ a, yogaka _n_ _d_ a,\nand _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anaka _n_ _d_ a ( _G_ aimini, Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali, Badarayana). See\nDeussen, Vedanta, p. 20. Mr. Gough and Dr. Roer take Brahmayoni as 'the source\nof the Veda,' or as the source of Hira _n_ yagarbha. The irregular form vedate\nmay be due to a corruption of vedante.\n\n[257:1](sbe15104.htm#fr_823) Here begins the description of what is called the\ntvam (thou), as opposed to the tat (that), i.e. the living soul, as opposed to\nthe Highest Brahman.\n\n[257:2](sbe15104.htm#fr_824) The paths of vice, virtue, and knowledge.\n\n[257:3](sbe15104.htm#fr_825) Both MSS. (A. and B.) read aragramatro by avaro\n'pi d _ri_ sh _th_ a _h_.\n\n[257:4](sbe15104.htm#fr_826) An expression of frequent occurrence in Buddhist\nliterature.\n\n[257:5](sbe15104.htm#fr_827) A. and B. read yu _g_ yate. A. explains yu _g_\nyate by sambadhyate. B. explains adyate bhakshyate tirobhuta _h_ kriyate. _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains rakshyate, sa _m_ rakshyate, tattaddharman atmany\nadhyasyabhimanyate.\n\n[257:6](sbe15104.htm#fr_828) The MSS. vary considerably. Instead of mohair, A.\nand B. read homair. They read grasambuv _ri_ sh _t_ ya _k_ atma. A. reads\natmaviv _ri_ ddhi _g_ anma, B. atmaniv _ri_ ddha _g_ anma. A. has\nabhisamprapadye, B. abhisamprapadyate. My translation follows _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, who\nseems to have read atmaviv _ri_ ddhi _g_ anma, taking the whole line p. 258 as\na simile and in an adverbial form. Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anatman, however, differs\nconsiderably. He reads homai _h_ , and explains homa as the act of throwing\noblations into the fire, as in the Agnihotra. This action of the hands, he\nthinks, stands for all actions of the various members of the body. Grasambuv\n_ri_ sh _t_ i he takes to mean free distribution of food and drink, and then\nexplains the whole sentence by 'he whose self is born unto some states or\ndeclines from them again, namely, according as he has showered food and drink,\nand has used his hands, eyes, feelings, and thoughts.' _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda takes a\nsimilar view, only he construes sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpanam and spar _s_ anam as two d _ri_ sh\n_t_ is, te eva d _ri_ sh _t_ i, tayor atmagnau prakshepa homa _h_ ; and then\ngoes on, na kevalam etai _h_ , ki _m_ tv asmin sthane _s_ arire grasambuv _ri_\nsh _t_ ya ka. He seems to read atmaviv _ri_ ddhaganma, but afterwards explains\nviv _ri_ ddhi by vividha v _ri_ ddhi _h_.\n\n[258:1](sbe15104.htm#fr_829) Forms as high as Hira _n_ yagarbha or as low as\nbeasts.\n\n[258:2](sbe15104.htm#fr_830) Instead of aparo, B. reads avaro, but explains\naparo.\n\n[258:3](sbe15104.htm#fr_831) Cf. III, 7; IV, 14, 16.\n\n[258:4](sbe15104.htm#fr_832) Ni _d_ a is explained as the body, but _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85karananda reads anilakhyam, who is called the wind, as being pra _n_ asya\npra _n_ am, the breath of the breath.\n\n[259:1](sbe15104.htm#fr_833) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains kalasargakaram by he who\ncreates the sixteen kalas, mentioned by the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas, beginning with\npra _n_ a, and ending with naman; see Pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ a Up. VI, 4. Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nanatman suggests two other explanations, 'he who creates by means of the kala,\ni.e. his inherent power;' or 'he who creates the Vedas and other sciences.'\nThe sixteen kalas are, according to _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda, pra _n_ a, _s_ raddha,\nkha, vayu, _g_ yoti _h_ , ap, p _ri_ thivi, indriya, mana _h_ , anna, virya,\ntapa _h_ , mantra, karman, kala (?), naman.
