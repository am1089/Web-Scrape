If it be said that they are mere glorification, on account of their\nreference; not so, on account of the newness.\n\nThe following point is next enquired into. Are texts such as 'That Udgitha is\nthe best of all essences, the highest, holding the supreme place, the eighth'\n( _Kh_. Up. I, 1, 3) meant to glorify the Udgitha as a constituent element of\nthe sacrifice, or to enjoin a meditation on the Udgitha as the best of all\nessences, and so on? The Purvapakshin holds the former view, on the ground\nthat the text declares the Udgitha to be the best of all essences in so far as\nbeing a constituent element of the sacrifice. The case is analogous to that of\ntexts such as 'the ladle is this earth, the ahavaniya is the heavenly world,'\nwhich are merely meant to glorify the ladle and the rest as constituent\nmembers of the sacrifice.--This view the latter part of the Sutra sets aside\n'on account of newness.'\n\np. 697\n\n[paragraph continues] Texts, as the one referring to the Udgitha, cannot be\nmere glorifications; for the fact of the Udgitha being the best of essences is\nnot established by any other means of proof, and the text under discussion\ncannot therefore be understood as a mere anuvada, meant for glorification. Nor\nis there, in proximity, any injunction of the Udgitha on account of connexion\nwith which the clause declaring the Udgitha to be the best of all essences\ncould naturally be taken as an anuvada (glorifying the thing previously\nenjoined in the injunctive text); while there is such an injunction in\nconnexion with the (anuvada) text 'The ladle is this earth,' and so on. We\nthus cannot but arrive at the conclusion that the text is meant to enjoin a\nmeditation on the Udgitha as being the best of all essences, and so on--the\nfruit of such meditation being an increase of vigour and efficacy on the part\nof the sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 22.
