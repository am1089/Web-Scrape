Let a man make a hut of leaves in a forest and dwell in it;\n\n2\\. And let him bathe (and perform his prayers) three times a day;\n\n3\\. And[1] let him collect alms, going from one village to another, and\nproclaiming his own deed;\n\n4\\. And[1] let him sleep upon grass:\n\n5\\. This is called a Mahavrata (great observance).\n\n6\\. He who has killed a Brahma _n_ a (unintentionally) must perform it for\ntwelve years.\n\n7\\. (He who has unintentionally killed) a Kshatriya or a Vai _s_ ya engaged in\na sacrifice, for the same period.\n\n[L. 1-6, 15. M. XI, 73; Y. III, 243; \xc3\x82past. I, 9, 24, 11-20; Gaut. XXII, 4-6.\n--7-10, 12-14. M. XI. 88, 89, 129-131; Y. III, 251, 266, 267; Gaut. XXII,\n12-16.--16-24. M. XI, 109-116; Y. III, 263.--25-41. M, XI, 131-138; Y. III,\n270-274.--30-33. \xc3\x82past.

XXII, 20, 21.\n\n3\\. 1 Nand., quoting Gautama XXII, 5, takes the particle _k_ a, 'and,' to\nimply that he should also make way for any \xc3\x82rya, whom he meets.\n\n4\\. 'The particle _k_ a here means, according to Nand., that he ought to\nremain chaste, as ordained by Gautama, XXII, 4.]\n\np. 158\n\n8\\. Likewise, he who has killed (unintentionally) a pregnant woman, or[1] a\nwoman in her courses.\n\n9\\. Or[1] a woman who has bathed after temporary uncleanness;\n\n10\\. Or[1] a friend.\n\n11\\. He who has (unintentionally) killed a king, must perform the Mahavrata\nfor twice the same number of years (or twenty-four years);\n\n12\\. He who has (unintentionally) killed. a Kshatriya (not engaged in a\nsacrifice, nor a king), for one quarter of that time less (or for nine years);\n\n13\\. He who has (unintentionally) killed a Vai _s_ ya (not engaged in a\nsacrifice), for half of that time (or for six years).\n\n14\\. He who has (unintentionally) killed a (virtuous) _S_ udra, for half of\nthat time again (or for three years).\n\n15\\. He who is performing any of those penances, must carry (on his stick) the\nskull of the person slain, like a flag.\n\n16\\. Let a man serve cows for a month, his hair and beard having been shorn.\n\n17\\. And let him sit down to rest when they rest;\n\n18\\. And[1] let him stand still when they stand still;\n\n[8. 1 Nand. infers from texts of Pra _k_ etas, Yama, and Para _s_ ara, that\nthe particle va, 'or,' here refers to pregnant cows, and to women whose\nconfinement is close at hand, or who are married to one who has kindled his\nsacred fire, or for whom all the sacred rites have been duly performed from\ntheir birth.\n\n19\\. 1 Nand. refers the particle va, 'or,' to women of high rank and to a\nrival wife, or a mother, or a daughter, or a sister, or a daughter-in-law, or\na wife, who is of the same caste as her husband.\n\n10\\. 1 'The particle va includes children here.' (Nand.)\n\n18\\. 1 According to Nand., the particle _k_ a here refers to the {footnote p.\n159} precept of Para _s_ ara, that he should drink water when the cows drink,\nand lie down when they lie down.]\n\np. 159\n\n19\\. And[1] let him give assistance to a cow that has met with an accident\n(such as getting into a slough, or falling into a pit).\n\n20\\. And let him preserve them from (the attacks of lions and tigers and\nother) dangers.\n\n21\\. Let him not seek shelter himself against cold (and hot winds) and similar\ndangers, without having previously protected the cows against them.\n\n22\\. Let him wash himself with cow-urine (three times a day);\n\n23\\. And[1] let him subsist upon the (five) productions of a cow:\n\n24\\. This is the Govrata (cow rite), which must be performed by him who has\n(unintentionally) killed a cow (belonging to a Kshatriya).\n\n25\\. If a man has killed an elephant (intentionally), he must give five black\n(nila) bulls.\n\n26\\. If he has killed (unintentionally) a horse, he must give a garment.\n\n27\\. If he has (intentionally) killed an ass, he must give a bull one year\nold.\n\n28\\. The same if he has (intentionally) killed a ram or a goat.\n\n29\\. If he has (intentionally) killed a camel, he must give one K _ri_ sh _n_\nala of gold.\n\n[19. 1 According to Nand., the particle _k_ a here implies another precept of\nPara _s_ ara, that he should not take notice of a cow grazing or drinking\nwater upon his own ground or that of another.\n\n23\\. 1 'The particle _k_ a, implies that he should also mutter the Gomati\nhymn, as _S_ atatapa says.' (Nand.)\n\n25\\. 'He is called a bull whose colour is red, whose mouth and tail are of a\nyellowish-white colour, and whose hoofs and horns are white.' (Ya _g_\n\xc3\xb1aparsva, quoted by Nand.)]\n\np. 160\n\n30\\. If he has (intentionally) killed a dog, he must fast for three days.\n\n31\\. If he has (unintentionally) killed a mouse, or a cat, or an ichneumon, or\na frog, or a Dundubha snake, or a large serpent (a boa constrictor), he must\nfast one day, and on the next day he must give a dish of milk, sesamum, and\nrice mixed together to a Brahma _n_ a, and give him an iron hoe as his 'fee.'\n\n32\\. If he has killed (unintentionally) an iguana, or an owl, or a crow, or a\nfish, he must fast for three days.\n\n33\\. If he has killed (intentionally) a Ha _m_ sa, or a crane, or a heron, or\na cormorant, or an ape, or a falcon, or the vulture called Bhasa, or a Brahma\n_n_ i duck, he must give a cow to a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n34\\. If he has killed a snake, (he must give) an iron spade.\n\n35\\. If he has killed emasculated (cattle or birds)[1], (he must give) a load\nof straw[2].\n\n36\\. If he has killed (intentionally) a boar, (he must give) a Kumbha of\nclarified butter.\n\n37\\. If he has (intentionally) killed a partridge, (he must give) a Dro _n_ a\nof sesamum.\n\n38\\. If he has (intentionally) killed a parrot, (he must give) a calf two\nyears old.\n\n39\\. If he has (intentionally) killed a curlew, (he must give) a calf three\nyears old.\n\n40\\. If he has (unintentionally) killed a wild carnivorous animal, he must\ngive a milch cow.\n\n[35. 1 Thus according to Nand., who declares himself against the\ninterpretation of sha _nd_ a by 'a eunuch;' see, however, Kulluka on M. XI,\n134, and Dr. Buhler's rendering of Gaut. XXII, 23.--2 Nand. adds, 'and a Masha\nof lead;' see the passages just referred to.]\n\np. 161\n\n41\\. If he has (unintentionally) killed a wild animal not carnivorous, (he\nmust give) a heifer.\n\n42\\. If he has (intentionally) killed an animal not mentioned before, he must\nsubsist upon milk for three days.\n\n43\\. If he has (unintentionally) killed a bird (not mentioned before), he must\neat at night only;\n\n44\\. Or (if unable to do so), he must give a silver Masha.\n\n45\\. If he has (unintentionally) killed an aquatic animal, he must fast (for a\nday and a night).\n\n46\\. If he has killed a thousand (small) animals having bones, or an ox-load\nof animals that have no bones, he must perform the same penance as for killing\na _S_ udra.\n\n47\\. But, if he has killed animals having bones, he must (moreover) give some\ntrifle to a Brahma _n_ a (for each animal which he has killed); if he has\nkilled boneless animals, he becomes purified by one stopping of the breath.\n\n48\\. For cutting (unawares?) trees yielding fruit (such as the bread-fruit or\nmango trees), shrubs, creeping or climbing plants, or plants yielding blossoms\n(such as the jasmine tree), he must mutter a Vedic text (the Gayatri) a\nhundred times.\n\n49\\. For killing (unintentionally) insects bred in rice or other food, or in\n(sweets and) the like, or in liquids (such as molasses), or elsewhere (in\nwater and so on), or in flowers or fruits, the penance consists in eating\nclarified butter.\n\n50\\. If a man has wantonly cut such plants as\n\n[46, 47. Nand. thinks that the former _S_ loka refers to intentional, and the\nlatter to unintentional murder of those animals.]\n\np. 162\n\ngrow by cultivation. (such as rice and barley), or such as rise spontaneously\nin the wood (such as wild rice), he must wait on a cow and subsist upon milk\nfor one day.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LI.](sbe07053.htm)\n\n"
