This view, we maintain, is altogether erroneous, springs in fact from\nthe neglect of distinguishing between persistence and non-persistence on the\none hand, and the relation between what sublates and what is sublated on the\nother hand. Where\n\np. 47\n\ntwo cognitions are mutually contradictory, there the latter relation holds\ngood, and there is non-persistence of what is sublated. But jars, pieces of\ncloth and the like, do not contradict one another, since they are separate in\nplace and time. If on the other hand the non-existence of a thing is cognised\nat the same time and the same place where and when its existence is cognised,\nwe have a mutual contradiction of two cognitions, and then the stronger one\nsublates the other cognition which thus comes to an end. But when of a thing\nthat is perceived in connexion with some place and time, the non-existence is\nperceived in connexion with some other place and time, there arises no\ncontradiction; how then should the one cognition sublate the other? or how can\nit be said that of a thing absent at one time and place there is absence at\nother times and places also? In the case of the snake-rope, there arises a\ncognition of non-existence in connexion with the given place and time; hence\nthere is contradiction, one judgment sublates the other and the sublated\ncognition comes to an end. But the circumstance of something which is seen at\none time and in one place not persisting at another time and in another place\nis not observed to be invariably accompanied by falsehood, and hence mere non-\npersistence of this kind does not constitute a reason for unreality. To say,\non the other hand, that what is is real because it persists, is to prove what\nis proved already, and requires no further proof.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Being and consciousness are not one](sbe48016.htm)\n\n'
