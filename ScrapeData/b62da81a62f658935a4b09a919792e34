But this is not so, (but rather) difference; since it is of the being of\nthat; as in the case of intuition.\n\nIt is not true that the meditating subject must be conceived as having the\nordinary characteristics of knowing, acting, &c.; it rather possesses those\ncharacteristic properties--freedom from evil, and so on--which distinguish the\nstate of Release from the Sa _m_ sara state. At the time of meditation the\nSelf of the devotee is of exactly the same nature as the released Self. 'For\nit is of the being of that,' i.e. it attains the nature of that--as proved by\nthe texts,\n\np. 675\n\n[paragraph continues] 'as the thought of a man is in this world, so he will be\nwhen he has departed,' and 'howsoever he meditate on him, such he becomes\nhimself.' Nor can it be maintained that these texts refer only to meditation\non the highest Self (without declaring anything as to the personal Self of the\ndevotee); for the personal Self constitutes the body of Brahman which is the\nobject of meditation, and hence itself falls under the category of object of\nmeditation. The character of such meditation, therefore, is that it is a\nmeditation on the highest Self as having for its body the individual Self,\ndistinguished by freedom from evil and the other qualities mentioned in the\nteaching of Pra _g_ apati. And hence the individual Self is, in such\nmeditation, to be conceived (not as the ordinary Self, but) under that form\nwhich it has to attain (i.e. the pure form which belongs to it in the state of\nRelease). 'As in the case of intuition'--i.e. as in the case of intuition of\nBrahman. As the intuition of Brahman has for its object the essential nature\nof Brahman, so the intuition of the individual soul also has for its object\nits permanent essential nature. In the case of sacrificial works the\nconception of the true nature of the Self forms an auxiliary factor. An\ninjunction such as 'Let him who is desirous of the heavenly world sacrifice,'\nenjoins the performance of the sacrifice to the end of a certain result being\nreached; while the conception of the Self as possessing characteristics such\nas being a knowing subject, and so on--which are separate from the body--has\nthe function of proving its qualification for works meant to effect results\nwhich will come about at some future time. So much only (i.e. the mere\ncognition of the Self as something different from the body) is required for\nworks (as distinguished from meditations).--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a\nof 'being in the body.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 53. But those meditations which are connected with members of\nsacrifices are not restricted to particular sakhas, but rather belong to all\nsakhas](sbe48437.htm)\n\n"
