S\xc2\x92aunaka said :-- \xc2\x93O Suta! Now describe as quickly as you can in detail\nwhat the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra did afterwards in the house of the Cha _nd_ ala.\n\n\n\n2-14. Suta said :-- When Vis\xc2\x92vamitra went away, the mind of the Cha _nd_ ala\nwas filled with joy. He already gave to Vis\xc2\x92vamitra that amount of jewels; so\nhe tied now the King and, telling him, \xc2\x93Do you now stand on the path of\nfalsehood?\xc2\x94 began to beat him with sticks. The King was already very much\ntired of the bereavements from his dear ones; now being beaten by the Cha _nd_\nala, his senses were lost. In this state the Cha _nd_ ala took him to his\nhouse and fastened him with a chain. Then the Cha _nd_ ala\xc2\x92s troubles were\nover and he fell asleep. The King lived in the Cha _nd_ ala\xc2\x92s house in that\nstate fettered by a chain; but he did not take any food there. Incessantly he\nwept for his wife and son and others. \xc2\x93Alas! That thin lady, seeing the sad\nface of\n\n\n\np. 673\n\n\n\nher son is now remembering me with a morose face. She is now perhaps thinking,\nwith a grieved heart, that whenever the King will get the money, he will pay\noff the promised money to the Brahmi _n_ and then will free us from this yoke\nof slavery. Alas! When will that day come when will he see me and this crying\nchild and speak with us. When the son will cry, saying, \xc2\x91I will go to my\nfather; father!\xc2\x92 When will he come and speak with the child? That fawn eyed\ngentle woman does not know that I am now placed under a Cha _nd_ ala. Alas! I\nam deprived of my kingdom, friends; and I have sold away my wife and son; now\nI am bound in the chain of slavery of a Cha _nd_ ala. Alas! So many miseries\nhave fallen on me all one after another.\xc2\x94 Thus thinking incessantly about his\ndear consort and son, the King passed his days in the house of that Cha _nd_\nala. Four days passed; and on the fifth day the Cha _nd_ ala came there and\nrebuked the King with very harsh words and freed him from his fastenings and\nsaid, \xc2\x93Go to the burial ground and collect the clothings of the dead bodies.\nThere is a wide S\xc2\x92masan (burial ground) on the southern part of Kas\xc2\x92i; go and\nprotect that and whatever is due to you, justly take that; do not leave it.\nTake this Jarjara club and go there quickly. Say to all that you are the\nmessenger of Viravahu and this staff is his.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n15-33. Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! Thus Haris\xc2\x92chandra became a Cha _nd_ ala\xc2\x92s\nservant and was engaged in collecting the cloths of the dead persons. Thus\nordered by the Cha _nd_ ala, whose duty was to collect the rags of the dead\nbodies, the King went to the burial ground. To the south of the city Kas\xc2\x92i,\nwas situated the dreadful S\xc2\x92masana, scattered over with the garlands of the\ndead, bad odours were emitting on all sides and it was covered all over with\nsmoke. Hundreds of jackals were yelling there and the ground was being\nreverberated by their yells. Vultures, jackals and dogs were at many places\ndragging the dead bodies. At other places were scattered heaps of bones; the\nwhole ground was covered with the putrid smell of the dead. At some places it\nseemed that from within the funeral pyre, the half-burnt dead bodies were\nlaughing wildly with their teeth wide open from their mouths. Thus the dead\nbodies looked terrible when being placed under fire. Lots of dead bodies were\nbrought there and there was a great tumultuous uproar made by the cries of\ntheir friends and relatives. Oh! My son! My friend! My relative! My brother!\nMy child! My dear wife! Oh! My cousin! Oh! My grandfather! Oh! My father! My\ngrandson! My acquaintance! Where hast thou gone leaving me here! Come once and\nlet me have a sight of thee! With such dreadful sounds as these, the burial\nground was being echoed. Flesh, marrow, fat all were being burnt in the\n\n\n\np. 674\n\n\n\nfire and a peculiar sound So _n_ , So _n_ was being produced there and\ncreating voidness in the minds of the people. The fire was burning with a\ncrackling noise. Thus the S\xc2\x92masana looked very terrible as if the universe was\nbeing destroyed at the end of a Kalpa. The King Haris\xc2\x92chandra arrived there;\nand, with extreme pain, he began to give vent to his sorrows. \xc2\x93My ministers,\nservants! Where are you all now? Where is kingdom that I got by a succession\nof inheritance! O my Son! O my dear wife! Where are you staying now, at what a\nlong distance, leaving me here out of the Brahmi _n_ \xc2\x92s anger. Without Dharma\nman can never get auspicious fruits. So men should carefully earn Dharma.\xc2\x94 The\nKing, whose body was covered with dust and dirt, thought thus repeatedly; and\nat last, remembering the Chandala\xc2\x92s words, went out in quest of the dead. Out\nof this eventful cares and anxieties, his body became lean like a stick; still\nhe ran, to and fro, and calculated thus :-- \xc2\x93This dead body will fetch for its\nprice one hundred gold mohurs; out of this, this belongs to the King; this to\nme, and this to the Cha _nd_ ala.\xc2\x94 So he thought constantly and his state\nbecame awful. His face, arm, belly and feet and the other parts of body were\nall covered over with ashes and dust; the King wore a ragged cloth where\nhundred places were sewn over; his toes were all besmeared with all sorts of\nflesh, marrow, fat and other things. He began to satisfy his hunger out of the\nfood that was prepared for all sorts of dead bodies; and, taking their\ngarlands, he encircled his head with them. Day and night he did not sleep and\nalways he sighed and sighed, crying, Alas! Alas! Thus one year passed away, as\nif it had been three hundred years.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-fourth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the stay of\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra in the burning ground in the Maha Pura _n_ am, S'ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 25](bk07ch25.htm)\n\n"
