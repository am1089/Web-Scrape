As he came near Nund\'s village on\nhis way from the banks of the river, the cowherdesses, who had come for water,\nsaw his ruth from afar coming along the road. On seeing it, they began to say\nto each other, "Whose ruth is this? that is coming towards us, let us see, and\nafterwards proceed on our journey?" One of them said, "Friend, I hope that\ndeceitful creature, Akroor, has not come, who took off Shree Krishnu Chund to\nlive at Muttra, and caused him to kill Kuns." Another said, "Why has this\ntreacherous wretch come again, he has already taken away the root of our\nlives, and what more will he take away?"\n\nO great king! carrying on various conversations of this kind, the women of\nBruj stood still, having taken the waterpots from their heads, and placed them\non the ground. In the mean while as the ruth came near some of the\ncowherdesses having seen Oodho a short way off, said to each other, Friend!\nwhy this is some one of a black colour with lotus-like eyes, and a crown on\nhis head; wearing a garland that reaches to his feet, dressed in yellow silk,\nand with\n\np. 178\n\na scarf of the same colour. He is sitting on a ruth like that of Shree\nKrishnu, and is looking at and coming towards us." One of them remarked, "This\nperson has been at Nund\'s house since yesterday; his name is Oodho, and Shree\nKrishnu Chund has sent some message by him."\n\nOn hearing these words, the cowherdesses, observing a retired spot, and laying\naside all propriety and reserve, rushed towards Oodho Jee--and regarding him\nas the friend of Krishnu, they made obeisance, and enquired after Krishnu,\nstanding on all sides of the ruth, with joined hands. Seeing their affection\nOodho Jee left his ruth; and the cowherdesses having seated him under the\nshade of a tree, sat themselves down on all sides of him, and began to say in\na most affectionate manner: "You have done well, Oodho, in coming, and\nbringing us news of Krishnu. You associate constantly with him; please inform\nus what message he has sent. You have been sent here only for the sake of his\nfather and mother; he thinks of no one else. We have sacrificed every thing\nfor him; our souls are entangled in his feet. He is occupied with his own\naffairs exclusively; and has given pain to all by his departure. And as birds\nleave trees without fruit, Huri in like manner has abandoned us; and although\nwe have given up every thing to him, he has not become ours."\n\nO great king! when the cowherdesses, filled with delight in their love for\nKrishnu, had talked thus for some time, Oodho, perceiving the great sincerity\nof their love, was about to rise to make a salutation, when a cowherdess, who\nsaw a bee on a flower, addressed Oodho, under pretence of addressing the\nbee--"O bee! thou hast imbibed the sweetness of Krishnu\'s lotus-like feet;\nand, therefore, thou hast obtained the name of the honey maker. Thou art the\nfriend of one who is deceitful; and, therefore, he has sent you as his\nmessenger, do not touch our feet, because we know that all of a black colour\nare treacherous, such as you are, such is Krishnu; therefore, do not make\nsalutations to us. In the same way that\n\np. 179\n\nyou roam from flower to flower, tasting its sweets, and belong not to any\nparticular one, Huri does not love any one, or belong to any one." Whilst the\ncowherdess was thus speaking another bee came; on seeing it, a cowherdess,\nnamed Seelta, said, "O bee, remain apart, and go and tell this in Muttra,\nwhere there is a hump-backed queen, and where Shree Krishnu Chund dwells. Why\nneed I speak of one birth; in each succeeding birth your behaviour is the\nsame? The Raja Buli gave up every thing, and you sent him to the infernal\nregions; and drove from her home one so virtuous as Seeta without fault on her\npart. Since they were thus treated, what had we to expect?" After this, all\nthe cowherdesses in a body, joining their hands, said to Oodho; "Oodho Jee! we\nhave lost our lord by the absence of Krishnu, take us away with you."\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! when the cowherdesses had thus spoken,\nOodho Jee said, "I will explain the contents of the letter Krishnu has sent by\nme, to which listen attentively. He has written, that you must give up all\nhope of sexual pleasure, and offer devotion to him; and that he will never be\nseparated from you; and he has added, that from the day you began to meditate\non him, none have been so much loved by him as you." Oodho added, "You have\nestablished a never-ending love for the first male, the immortal Huri; and\nregarded him as your lord, whom all else celebrate as the invisible,\nimperceptible, inscrutable being, and as earth, wind, water, fire and air\ndwell in the body, so Krishnu dwells in you; but through the influence of his\ndelusive powers seems to be apart. Bear him in mind and meditate upon him. He\nalways promoted the advantage of his worshippers; and by his remaining near\nmeditation and religious knowledge are utterly destroyed. For this reason Huri\nhas gone to live at a distance. And Shree Krishnu Chund gave me also to\nunderstand, that playing on the flute he invited you into the jungle, and when\nhe saw\n\np. 180\n\nthe strength of your love and passion for him, he took part in your\nfestivities; when you forgot his divinity, the lord of Judoos disappeared.\nWhen having recovered understanding, you again meditated upon Huri, he,\nknowing the piety of your minds, presented himself to you."\n\nO great king! when Oodho had thus spoken, the cowherdesses said angrily, "We\nhave heard all your speeches; stand apart from us now. You tell us to\ncultivate knowledge and understanding, and perform penance, and tell us to\nabandon meditation and look up at the sky. You call him Narayun, in whose\nsports our minds have been deeply engaged. Why has he become an invisible and\nimperceptible being, who has conferred happiness on us from his childhood? And\nhow has he, who was endowed with all good qualities and great personal beauty,\nbecome a being without qualities and form? Who will pay any attention to what\nyou have said, considering that our souls are wrapped up in his beloved body?"\nOne of them rose up and said, "Let us endeavour to conciliate Oodho: say\nnothing to him, but listen to what he says, and watch his looks." Another\nsaid, "It is not his fault, the hump-backed woman (Koobja) has sent him here.\nHe is now merely repeating what Koobja has taught him to say. Krishnu would\nnever speak as Oodho has spoken since his arrival at Bruj. We are pierced with\nthorns at hearing such speeches, and cannot endure listening to them. He tells\nus to abandon all thought of sexual pleasure, and engage in devotion; when\nwould Krishnu speak thus? Prayers, penance, fasting, vows and prescribed rules\nof conduct are all acts becoming widows. May Shree Krishnu live in every age,\nhaving conferred happiness on us all. Who makes use of ashes, and of cow-dung\nwhile her husband is alive? Say, where does this custom prevail? Our vows,\npenance and fasts consist in showing our love for Nund and Nundun constantly.\nWho can possibly blame you, Oodho? this is a dance of Koobja\'s getting up."\n\np. 181\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said, O great king! when\nOodho had heard these affectionate words of the cowherdesses, he regretted and\nwas ashamed that he had mentioned the subject of penance to them, and remained\nsilent; with downcast looks. One of the cowherdesses enquired after Bulram,\nand said, "Does he ever think of and call to mind our childish love?" Another\nreplied, "Friend! you are all cowherdesses and common village women, and the\nwomen of Muttra are beautiful, by whom Huri has been captivated, and is\nengaged in sports with them, why should he now think of us? Since he went to\nreside there, he has become the beloved of other women; had we known\nbeforehand this would happen, we would not have let him go away. Regrets are\nnow of no avail, it is better to lay aside grief, and hope for his return.\nBecause, as during eight months the earth, forests and hills, endure heat in\nexpectation of rain, which comes in due course and cools them; in like manner\nKrishnu will also come to us." One said, "Huri has accomplished all his\nbusiness, and has destroyed his enemies, and taken possession of their\ngovernment, why should he come to Brindabun, and leave his kingly power to\ntend herds? O companions! give up all expectations of his coming. The case is\nquite hopeless; and we ought not to think any more about it." One of them\nsaid, in great distraction of mind, "Why should we give up all hope of\nKrishnu? On seeing the forests, hills and the banks of the Jumna, where Shree\nKrishnu and Bulbeer engaged in sports, our recollection of Huri, the lord of\nour hearts, returns forcibly." She then said, "This village of Bruj has become\na sea of grief: his name is a boat in the midst of the stream. Krishnu will\ntake across all who are immerged in the waters of absence and separation. Why\nhas he forgotten, that he is lord of the cowherdesses? Is he not ashamed on\naccount of his name?" On hearing these words, Oodho, reflecting, began to say,\n"Happy are these cowherdesses! and blessed be their firmness,\n\np. 182\n\nin having given up all else, and become absorbed in meditation upon Shree\nKrishnu Chund."\n\nO great king! Oodho Jee saw and praised their love, when at the same time all\nthe cowherdesses rose up, and brought him to their homes with great respect\nand dignity. Perceiving their affection, he dined with them; and after resting\nhe made them all very happy by telling them stories of Shree Krishnu. All the\ncowherdesses, having then performed poojah to Oodho Jee, and placed many\npresents before him, said with joined hands and the greatest humility, "Oodho\nJee! go and say to Huri, lord! formerly you were very kind to us, and used to\ntake us by the hand about with you; but since you have obtained power, you\nhave written to us about penance at the suggestion of that strumpet, Koobja.\nWe, poor, impure creatures, have never been initiated by a spiritual preceptor\nin any mystical prayer: what knowledge can we possibly possess; from our\nchildhood we have loved him, and what do we know of the customs of penance?\nWhy has Huri not come himself to tell us what penance to perform? This is not\na subject to send a message about. Oodho! go and explain to him, that our\nlives are ebbing out, let him come and preserve them."\n\nO great king! when they had thus spoken, the cowherdesses were delighted in\nfixing their thoughts on Huri; and Oodho, having made the usual salutation,\ntook leave and, returned thence in his ruth to Brindabun. He remained there\nfor some days; and on his way back he visited and stayed a few days at each of\nthe places, where Shree Krishnu Chund had been engaged in sports. At length\nafter some days he returned to Brindabun, and having gone to Nund and Jusodha,\nsaid with joined hands, "Owing to your friendship, I have stayed for some time\nat Bruj, and now, with your permission, will go to Muttra." On hearing these\nwords, the Ranee Jusodha went into the house, and brought forth milk, curds,\nbutter and sweetmeats in large quantities; and presenting them to Oodho,\n\np. 183\n\nsaid, "Give these to our beloved Shree Krishnu and Bulram, and tell our\nsister, Dewukee, to send them both to us without any delay." Having\ncommunicated this message, the wife of Nund began to weep. Then Nund Jee said\nto Oodho, "What more need we say to you? You are yourself possessed of great\nsense, understanding and knowledge, and many excellent qualities; intercede\nfor us with Krishnu in such a way that he, taking into consideration the\nsufferings of the inhabitants of Bruj, may come to us quickly, and not forget\nus altogether."\n\nAfter having thus spoken, when Nund Rae shed tears, and all the inhabitants of\nBruj, male and female, standing round, began also to weep, Oodho Jee consoled\nthem, and restored them to composure of mind by his explanations; and,\naccompanied by Rohnee, took his departure for Muttra; and after journeying\nsome time, arrived at the abode of Shree Krishnu Chund. On seeing him, Shree\nKrishnu and Buldeo rose and embraced him, and enquired in the most\naffectionate manner regarding his health, and the news of Brindabun, "Say\nOodho Jee! are Nund and Jusodha, and the inhabitants of Bruj all well, and do\nthey ever think of us?" Oodho Jee replied, "O great king! I am quite unable to\ndescribe the greatness of Bruj, and the love of its inhabitants; you are their\nlife; night and day do they think of you, and their love for you is as\ncomplete as a perfect worship, performed with all prescribed ceremonies. I\nmentioned to them your advice regarding the performance of penance; but I have\nlearnt from them the manner, in which adoration should be offered." Oodho Jee,\nhaving communicated this intelligence, added, "O merciful to the poor! what\nmore need I say you are acquainted with the secret thoughts of each mind; and\nunderstand me without any lengthened explanation on my part, that all things\nin Bruj, animate and inanimate, are greatly distressed at not being able to\nsee and touch you; and the only hope they have is, that you may return."\n\np. 184\n\nOn hearing these words, the two brothers were greatly dispirited; and Oodho\nJee, taking leaving of Shree Krishnu Chund, conveyed the message of Nund and\nJusodha to Basoodeo and Dewukee, and went home. Rohnee Jee was filled with joy\nat meeting with Shree Krishnu and Bulram, and abode in her own house.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XLIX](psa50.htm)\n\n'
