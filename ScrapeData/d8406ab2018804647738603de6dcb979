The hot season came first,\nand by its arrival, took away all the pleasure of the world; and having heated\nthe earth and atmosphere, made them like fire; but owing to the glory of\nKrishnu, there was constant spring in Brindabun. There creepers bloomed on\nnumerous arbours of trees; flowers of different kinds blossomed, upon which\nthere was the buzzing of swarms of bees. Kokilas poured forth their notes on\nthe mango branches, and peacocks strutted about in cool, shady places. A\nsweetly scented breeze was blowing, and on one side of the jungle, the retired\nJumna exhibited its beauty. Krishnu and Bulram left the cows, and were engaged\nin all sorts of rare sports with their companions, when a demon, named\nPurlunt, who had been sent by Kuns, came in the form of a cowherd. On seeing\nhim, Shree Krishnu said to Buldeo with a wink--"This is no friend of ours,\nBulbeer, this is an evil spirit, who has come in a disguised form. Let us take\nmeasures for his destruction, we cannot kill him while he is in the form of a\ncowherd; when he assumes his own form, do you kill him immediately."\n\np. 68\n\nHaving thus instructed Buldeo, Shree Krishnu Jee laughing and calling Purlunt\nto him, took hold of his hand and said, Your appearance is most beautiful; you\nare certainly our friend, without any deceit."\n\nHaving thus spoken, and taking Purlunt with him, he divided the cowherds\'\nchildren into two equal portions, taking half himself and giving half to\nBulram Jee, and having made two of their young companions sit down, he and\nBulram began to ask, and explain the names of fruits and flowers.\n\nIn this sport of explanation Shree Krishnu lost, Buldeo won. Then those who\nwere on Shree Krishnu\'s side ran off with the companions of Buldeo on their\nshoulders. Purlunt outstripped them all, taking Bulram with him, and having\nreached the jungle, he began to increase in size.\n\nBuldeo on this black hill-like (monster,) appeared as beautiful as the moon in\na dark-coloured cloud, and the splendour of his ear-rings was as dazzling as\nlightning, the perspiration fell from him like rain. Having narrated thus\nmuch, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit,--O great king! when\nhaving got him alone, the demon was on the point of destroying Buldeo, he\nkilled Purlunt with blows.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XX](psa21.htm)\n\n'
