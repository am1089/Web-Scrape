Upon this, a cowherdess began to\nsay,--"Tell me friend! where has Mohun gone, after having dispersed us. He was\ncaressing me with his arms round my neck. He was but now engaged with us in\nfestive songs and dances. Where has he gone, and did not any of you see him,\nwhile he was going away?"\n\nOn hearing these words, all the cowherdesses were exceedingly sad at their\nseparation from Krishnu, and said, heaving deep sighs, "Where shall we go,\nwhat shall we do, to whom shall we call out? No one knows where he is, how\nshall we find Krishnu?"\n\nSpeaking thus, and being inflamed with the love of Huri, all the cowherdesses\nbegan to search for Huri in every direction: and singing his praises,\n(celebrating his many good qualities,) and weeping exclaimed, "Why have you\nleft us, O lord of Bruj! we have given up every thing to you?"\n\np. 105\n\nWhen they did not find Krishnu where they first searched, they advanced some\ndistance, and said to each other, "We can see no one here, from whom shall we\nenquire where Krishnu has gone?" A cowherdess said, "Friends! a thought occurs\nto me, that all the beasts, birds and trees in this forest are saints and\nsages. They have descended upon the earth to behold the sports of Krishnu,\nenquire from them, who must have seen from their present position, and who\nwill be able to point out where Huri has gone." On hearing this suggestion,\nthe cowherdesses, who were very uneasy in their minds in consequence of their\nseparation from Krishnu, began to question every animate and inanimate\nobject:--"O fig tree and other trees! you have obtained your present lofty\nform through the performance of acts of virtue. You have been beneficent to\nothers, assuming on earth the form of trees. You have endured the pains of\nheat, cold and rain, and remained standing for others\' advantage. O bark,\nblossoms, roots, fruits and branches! with which you benefit others, be so\nkind as to tell us, whether Huri., who has stolen all our affections and\nwealth, has come here. O palm, mango, and kuchnari! have you seen Moorari\ngoing off in any direction? O chumpa and other trees! have you seen Bulbeer\nany where? O full blown toolsee! much beloved by Huri, whom he never allows to\nbe separated from his body, have you met Krishnu to-day? Who will point out to\nus where he is? O jasmines of different kinds! has Shree Krishnu come in this\ndirection?" The women of Bruj called out to the deer, "Have you seen Krishnu\npass in this direction?"\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great king! the\ncowherdesses, enquiring in this way from animals, birds, trees and creepers,\nwhere Krishnu had gone, began, after the manner of Shree Krishnu to represent\nthe death of Pootna, and to go through all the sports and amusements, which\nHuri had engaged in, and continued to search for him.\n\np. 106\n\nAt length after searching some time, and having gone some distance, they\nbeheld the marks of Krishnu\'s feet, his lotus banner and iron goad, glittering\non the sand.\n\nThe women of Bruj seeing the dust, which gods, men and sages search for, made\nan obeisance to it; and having placed it upon their heads, and entertaining a\nhope of meeting Krishnu proceeded onward; when lo! the traces of a woman\'s\nfeet became visible near the marks of the feet, which they had first beheld.\nThey were surprised at the sight, and advancing further, they found a\nbeautiful looking glass, studded with gems, on a bed of soft leaves. They\nbegan to question it. When it would not speak in consequence of the pain of\nseparation from a loved object, they asked each other, "Friend! why did he\ntake this with him?" Then, one, who knew the mutual feelings of lovers and\ntheir beloved, replied, "Friend! when the lover sat down to plait the hair of\nhis beloved, and his lovely form was concealed from sight, his beloved then\ntook the looking glass in her hand, and showed it to her lover. Then the image\nof Shree\'s face was reflected from the mirror."\n\nThe cowherdesses were not at all angry at hearing this remark; but began to\nsay, "She must have worshipped Shivu and Parvuttee well, and performed great\npenance, to be able to enjoy diversion with the lord of life in this retired\nmanner, without fear." O great king! all the cowherdesses, intoxicated with\nlove, were thus idly talking, and wandering about in search of Krishnu, whilst\nShree Radhika Jee, deriving great enjoyment from Huri, and thinking her\nbeloved in a state of subserviency to her, considering herself greater than\nall others, and indulging in great presumptuousness of mind, said, "O beloved!\nI am not able to walk, please carry me on your shoulders."\n\nOn hearing this, Shree Krishnu Chund, the annihilator of pride, and acquainted\nwith the secrets of the heart, smiled, and sitting down, said to her, "Come\nand sit on my shoulders."\n\np. 107\n\n[paragraph continues] When she put forth her hands to climb up, Shree Krishnu\ndisappeared; and she remained standing in that posture, with her arms\nstretched out; just as lightning forces its way presumptuously from the\nclouds, or the angry moonbeams separate themselves from the moon. And the\nsplendour of her fair form, escaping and spreading upon the earth, displayed\nas much beauty, as an elegant woman, standing upon ground of gold. Tears\nstreamed from her eyes; and she could not drive away the bees, who overpowered\nby the sweet smell came and settled near her face. And heaving deep sighs, she\nwept so violently in her solitude in the jungle, distressed by the separation\nfrom Krishnu, that the animals, birds, trees and creepers, hearing her\nlamentations, began weeping also.\n\nAnd thus she exclaimed, "O lord! best of lovers, where have you gone, O self-\nwilled Beharee! I am the slave of the asylum of thy feet. O sea of\nbeneficence! have compassion on me."\n\nIn the mean while the cowherdesses, continuing their search, came up to where\nshe was; and throwing themselves on her neck, embraced her with the same\ndegree of pleasure, as a man, who had lost great wealth, would experience in\nthe midst of his losses, in recovering half of it. At length, observing that\nshe was very much distressed, the cowherdesses, taking her with them, went in\nthe great forest, and searched for Shree Krishnu Chund as long as the\nmoonlight lasted. When they could not find their road in the jungle on account\nof the darkness, they all returned thence with a confident hope of meeting\nKrishnu, and came and sat down on that bank of the Jumna on which Shree\nKrishnu Chund had afforded them very great pleasure.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXII](psa33.htm)\n\n'
