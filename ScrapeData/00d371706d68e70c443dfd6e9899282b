Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! In connection with this Puras\xc2\x92chara _n_\nam it comes now to my memory about the rules concerning the Vais\xc2\x92va Deva\nworship (An offering made to the Vis\xc2\x92vadevas; an offering to all deities made\nby presenting oblations to fire before meals). Hear. The five yaj\xc3\xb1as are the\nfollowing :-- (1) The Devayaj\xc3\xb1a, (2) Brahma yaj\xc3\xb1a, (3) Bhuta yaj\xc3\xb1a, (4) Pitri\nyaj\xc3\xb1a, and (5) Manu _s_ ya yaj\xc3\xb1a. Fireplace, the pair of stone pestles, brooms\n(for sweeping, etc.), sieves and other house-hold things of the sort, wooden\nmortars (used for cleansing grains from husk) and water-jars, these five are\nthe sources of evils inasmuch as they are the means of killing. So to free\none\xc2\x92s self from the above sins, one is to sacrifice before the Vais\xc2\x92vadeva.\nNever offer oblations of Vais\xc2\x92vadeva on hearths, on any iron vessel, on the\nground or on broken tiles. They are to be offered in any sacrificial pit (Ku\n_nd_ a) or on any sacrificial altar. Do not fire the hearth by fanning with\nhands, with winnowing baskets, or with holy deer skin, etc., but you can do so\nby blowing by your mouth. For the mouth is the origin of fire. If the fire be\nignited by clothes, one is liable to get disease; if by winnowing baskets,\nthen less of wealth comes; if by hands, one\xc2\x92s death ensues. But if it be done\nby blowing, then one\xc2\x92s success comes. (There is the danger of catching fire.)\n\n\n\nOne should sacrifice with curd, ghee, fruits, roots and vegetables, and water\nand in their absence with fuel, grass, etc., or with any other substances\nsoaked with ghee, curd, Payasa or lastly with water. But never with oil or\nwith salty substances. If one performs the Homa with dry or stale substances,\none is attacked with leprosy; if anybody performs Homa with leavings of other\nfood he becomes subdued by his enemy; if one does so with rude and harsh\nsubstances, he becomes poor and if one does with salty substances, he meets\nwith a downward course, gets degraded in position and honour. You can offer\noblations to Vais\xc2\x92vadeva with burning coals and ashes from the north side of\nthe fire of the hearth after the preparation of the meals. But you should\nnever offer sacrifices with salty things. The\n\n\n\np. 1125\n\n\n\nilliterate Brahma _n_ a who eats before offering oblations to Vais\xc2\x92vadeva goes\nheadlong downwards into the Kala Sutra hell. Whatever food that you are\nintending to prepare, whether they be vegetables, leaves, roots or fruits,\noffer oblations to Vais\xc2\x92vadeva with that if, before the Homa be performed of\nVais\xc2\x92vadeva, any Brahmachari comes, then take off, for the Homa, first\nsomething; and then give to the beggar and satisfy him and tell him to be off.\nFor the Brahmachari mendicant can remove any defects that may occur to\nVais\xc2\x92vadeva but Vais\xc2\x92vadeva is unable to remove any defects that may occur\nregarding the mendicant Brahmachari. Both the Paramahansa or Brahmachari\nmendicant are the masters of the prepared food (Pakkanna); so when anybody\ntakes one\xc2\x92s food without giving to any of these two, if they happen to come\nthere, he will have to make the Chandraya _n_ a (religious or expiatory\npenance regulated by the moon\xc2\x92s age, that is, waxing or waning). O Narada!\nAfter the offering given to Vais\xc2\x92vanara, one is to offer Gograsa, that is,\nmouthfuls of food to the cows. Hear now how that is done. The mother Surabhi,\nthe beloved of Vi _sn_ u, is always stationed in the region of Vi _sn_ u (Vi\n_sn_ upada); so O Surabhi! I am offering you mouthfuls of food. Accept it.\n\xc2\x93Salutation to the cows,\xc2\x94 saying this, one is to worship the cows and offer\nfood to them. Hereby Surabhi, the Mother of the cows, becomes pleased. After\nthis, one is to wait outside for a period that is taken to milch a cow,\nwhether any guests are coming. For if any guest goes back disappointed from\nany house without any food; he takes away all the pu _n_ yams (merits) of the\nhouse-holder and gives him back his own sin. The house-holder is to support\nmother, father, Guru, brother, son, servants, dependants, guests, those that\nhave come, and Ag _n_ i (Fire). Knowing all these, he who does not perform the\nfunctions of the house-hold is reckoned as fallen from his Dharma both in this\nworld and in the next. The poor house-holder gets the same fruit by performing\nthese five Maha jaj\xc3\xb1as that a rich Brahma _n_ a gets by performing the Soma\nYaj\xc3\xb1a. O Best of the Munis! Now I am talking of the Pranagni Hotra or about\ntaking food, knowing the rules of which makes a man free from birth, old age\nand death and from all sorts of sins. He who takes his food according to\nproper rules, is freed of the threefold debts, delivers his twenty one\ngenerations from the hells, obtains the fruits of all the Yaj\xc3\xb1as and goes\nunhampered to all the regions of the righteous. Think of the belly as Ara _n_\ni or the piece of wood for kindling the fire\n\n(by attrition), think of the mind as the churning rod, and think of the wind\nas the rope, and then kindle the fire, residing in the belly; the eyes are to\nbe considered as the sacrificer, (the\n\n\n\np. 1126\n\n\n\n\n\nAddharyu), and consider fire in the belly as the result of churning. In this\nfire of the belly, one is to offer oblations for the satisfaction of Pra _n_\na, etc., the five deities. First of all offer oblations to the Pra _n_ a Vayu\nwith food taken by the forefinger, middlefinger and thumb; next offer\noblations to the Apana Vayu with the thumb, middle finger and the nameless\n(anama) finger; next offer oblations to the Vyana Vayu (breath) with the\nthumb, nameless finger and the little finger; next offer oblations to the\nUdana Vayu with the thumb, forefinger and the little finger and lastly offer\noblations to the Samana Vayu with food taken by all the fingers. At the same\ntime repeat respectively the mantras :--\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93Om Pra _n_ aya Svaha,\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Apanaya Svaha,\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Samanaya Svaha,\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Udanaya Svaha,\xc2\x94\n\n\xc2\x93Om Vyanaya Svaha.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nWithin the mouth, there is the \xc3\x82havaniya fire; within the heart, there is the\nGarhapatya fire; in the navel, there is the Dhak _s_ i _n_ agni fire; below\nthe navel, there is the Sabhyagni fire and below that there is the\n\xc3\x82vasathyagni fire. Think thus. Next consider the Speech as the Hota, the Pra\n_n_ a as the Udgatha, the eyes as the Addharyu, the mind as the Brahma, the\nears as the Hota and the keeper of the Ag _n_ i, the Ahamkara (egoism) as\nbeast (Pas\xc2\x92u), Om Kara as water, the Buddhi (intellect) of the house-holder as\nthe legal wife, the heart as the sacrificial altar, the hairs and pores as the\nKus\xc2\x92a grass, and the two hands as the sacrificial ladles and spoons (Sruk and\nSruva.) Then think of the colour of the Pra _n_ a mantra as golden the fire of\nhunger as the Ri _s_ i (seer), Surya (the sun) as Devata, the chhandas as\nGayatri and Pranaya Svaha as the Mantra uttered; also repeat \xc2\x93Idamadityadevaya\nnama _h_ \xc2\x94 and offer oblations to the Pra _n_ a. The colour of the Apana\nmantra is milk white. S\xc2\x92raddhagni is the Ri _s_ i, the Moon is the Devata, U\n_sn_ ik is the chhandas, and \xc2\x93Apanaya Svaha,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Idam Somaya na nama _h_ \xc2\x94 are\nthe mantras. The colour of the Vyana mantra is red like red lotuses; the fire\nDeity Hutasana is the Ri _s_ i, the fire is the Devata; Anu _st_ up is the\nchhandas, \xc2\x93Vyanaya Svaha\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93Idamagnaye na namah\xc2\x94 are the mantras. The\ncolour of the Udana mantra is like that of the worm Indra Gopa; fire is the Ri\n_s_ i; Vayu is the Devata, Brihati is the chhandas; \xc2\x93Udanaya Svaha\xc2\x92\xc2\x92 and \xc2\x93Idam\nVayave na nama _h_ \xc2\x94 are the mantras. The colour of the Samana mantra is like\nlightning; Ag _n_ i is the Ri _s_ i; Parjanya (the rains, water) is the\nDevata; Pankti is the chhanda; \xc2\x93Samanaya\n\n\n\np. 1127\n\n\n\nSvaha\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93Idam Parjanyaya na nama _h_ \xc2\x94 are the mantras. O Narada! Thus\noffering the five oblations to the five breaths, next offer oblations to the\n\xc3\x82tman; the Bhi _s_ a _n_ a Vah _n_ i is the Ri _s_ i; the Gayatri is the\nchhanda; the Self is the Devata; \xc2\x93\xc3\x82tmane Svaha,\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93Idamatmane na nama _h_ \xc2\x94\nare the mantras. O Narada! He who knows this Homa of Pranagnihotra attains the\nstate of Brahma. Thus I have spoken to you in brief the rules of the Pranagni\nhotra Homa.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-Second Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the rules of\nVais\xc2\x92vadeva in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 23](bk11ch23.htm)\n\n'
