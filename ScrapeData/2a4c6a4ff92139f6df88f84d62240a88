Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman 3 as the five worlds. The hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara\nis, the earth, the prastava the fire, the udgitha the sky, the pratihara the\nsun, the nidhana heaven; so in an ascending line.\n\n2\\. In a descending line, the hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara is heaven,\n\np. 24\n\nthe prastava the sun, the udgitha the sky, the pratihara the fire, the nidhana\nthe earth.\n\n3\\. The worlds in an ascending and in a descending line belong to him who\nknowing this meditates on the fivefold Saman as the worlds 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[23:3](sbe01036.htm#fr_127) The five forms in which the Saman is used for\nsacrificial purposes. The Saman is always to be under-stood as the Good, as\nDharma, and as Brahman.\n\n[24:1](sbe01036.htm#fr_128) The commentator supplies some fanciful reasons why\neach of the five Samans is identified with certain objects. Earth is said to\nbe the hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara, because both always come first. Agni is prastava, because\nsacrifices are praised in the fire (prastuyante). The sky is udgitha, because\nit is also called gagana, and both words have the letter g in common. The sun\nis pratihara, because everybody wishes the sun to come towards him (prati).\nHeaven is nidhana, because those who depart from here are placed there\n(nidhiyante), &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3](sbe01037.htm)\n\n'
