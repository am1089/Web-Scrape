"There are three deities, according to the\nexpounders of the Vedas: Agni, whose place is on the earth; V\xc4\x81yu or Indra,\nwhose place is in the air; and Surya, whose place is in the sky. These deities\nreceive severally many appellations in consequence of their greatness, or of\nthe diversity of their functions." * In the Rig-Veda itself this number is\nincreased to thirty-three, of whom eleven are said to be in heaven, eleven on\nearth, and eleven in mid-air. "Agni, the wise god, lends an ear to his\nworshippers. God with the ruddy steeds, who lovest praise, bring hither those\nthree-and-thirty." This is the number usually mentioned, though it is by no\nmeans easy to decide which are the thirty-three intended, as the lists found\nin various places vary considerably; whilst in another verse it is said that\n"three hundred, three thousand, thirty-and-nine gods have worshipped Agni."\n\nThese deities, though spoken of as immortal, are not said to be self-existent\nbeings; in fact their parentage in most cases is given; but the various\naccounts of their origin do not agree with each other. Agni and Savitri\n\np. 10\n\nare said to have conferred immortality upon the other gods; whilst it is also\ntaught that Indra obtained this boon by sacrifice. An interesting account is\ngiven in the Satapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana * of the means by which the gods obtained\nimmortality, and superiority over the asuras or demons. All of them, gods and\ndemons alike, were mortal, all were equal in power, all were sons of Praj\xc4\x81pati\nthe Creator. Wishing to be immortal, the gods offered sacrifices liberally,\nand practised the severest penance; but not until Praj\xc4\x81pati had taught them to\noffer a particular sacrifice could they become immortal. They followed his\nadvice, and succeeded. Wishing to become greater than the asuras, they became\ntruthful. Previously they and the asuras spoke truthfully or falsely, as they\nthought fit; but gradually, whilst they ceased from lying, the asuras became\nincreasingly false; the result was that the gods after protracted struggles\ngained the victory. Originally the gods were all equal in power, all alike\ngood. But three of them desired to be superior to the rest, viz. Agni, Indra,\nand Surya. They continued to offer sacrifices for this purpose until it was\naccomplished. Originally there was not in Agni the same flame as there is now.\nHe desired, "May this flame be in me," and, offering a sacrifice for the\nattainment of this blessing, obtained it. In a similar manner Indra increased\nhis energy, and Surya his brightness. These three deities form what is\ncommonly described as the Vedic Triad. In later times other three took their\nplace, though an attempt is made to show them to be the same.\n\nIt will be noticed that each of the gods is in turn regarded by the worshipper\nas superior to all the others. In the Vedas this superlative language is\nconstantly\n\np. 11\n\nemployed, and identical epithets are indiscriminately given to various\ndeities. Professor Max-Muller says, "When these individual gods are invoked,\nthey are not conceived as limited by the power of others, as superior or\ninferior in rank. Each god, to the mind of the supplicants, is as good as all\nthe gods. He is felt at the time as a real divinity, as supreme and absolute,\nin spite of the limitations which, to our mind, a plurality of gods must\nentail on every single god. All the rest disappear for a moment from the\nvision of the poet, and he only who is to fulfil their desires, stands in full\nlight before the eyes of the worshippers. . . . It would be easy to find, in\nthe numerous hymns of the Rig-Veda, passages in which almost every single god\nis represented as supreme and absolute."\n\nThe will of these gods is sovereign; no mortal can thwart their designs. They\nexercise authority over all creatures. In their hands is the life of mortals.\nThey know the thoughts and intentions of men, and whilst they reward the\nworshipper, they punish those who neglect them.\n\nWhen the Puranic deities are described it will be noticed that the\nrepresentations of the deities of that age are far more clearly defined than\nthose of earlier times. Though the Vedic gods are spoken of as possessing\nhuman forms and acting as human beings, there is considerable vagueness in the\noutline. But as time goes on this is lost. The objects of worship are no\nlonger indistinct and shadowy, but are so minutely described that their\nportraits could be easily painted. And as their physical features are no\nlonger left to the imagination, so their mental and moral characters are fully\ndelineated. They are of like passions with those who depict them, only\npossessing vastly greater powers.\n\np. 12\n\nProfessor Williams says * "that the deified forces addressed in the Vedic\nhymns were probably not represented by images or idols in the Vedic period,\nthough doubtless the early worshippers clothed their gods with human forms in\ntheir own imaginations." Professor Muller \xe2\x80\xa0 speaks more positively: "The\nreligion of the Veda knows of no idols. The worship of idols in India is a\nsecondary formation, a later degradation of the more primitive worship of\nideal gods." The guarded language of Professor Williams seems to be better\nsuited to the facts, as far as they are known, for Dr. Bollensen \xe2\x80\xa1 speaks\nquite as strongly on the other side. He writes, "From the common appellation\nof the gods as _divo naras_ , \'men of the sky,\' or simply _naras_ , \'men,\' and\nfrom the epithet _nripesas_ , \'having the form of men,\' we may conclude that\nthe Indians did not merely in imagination assign human forms to their gods,\nbut also represented them in a sensible manner. Thus a painted image of Rudra\n(Rig-Veda, ii. 33, 9) is described with strong limbs, many-formed, awful,\nbrown, he is painted with shining colours.\'" "Still clearer appears the\nreference to representations in the form of an image. \'I now pray to the gods\nof these (Maruts).\' Here it seems that the Maruts are distinguished from their\ngods, _i.e._ their images.\'" "There is in the oldest language a word, \'\n_Sandris_ ,\' which properly denotes \'an image of the gods.\'\n\nWe shall now proceed to the consideration in detail of the deities as\ndescribed in the Vedas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[9:*](hmvp06.htm#fr_3) Muir, O.
