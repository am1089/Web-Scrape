A talented\n\np. 311\n\npupil, O terror of your foes! asked a Brahma _n_ a preceptor of rigid vows,\n(when he was) seated, something about the highest good. 'I' (he said), 'whose\ngoal is the highest good, am come to you (who are) venerable; I pray of you\nwith (bowed) head, O Brahma _n_ a! that you should explain to me what I ask.'\nThe preceptor, O son of P _ri_ tha! said to the pupil who spoke thus: 'I will\nexplain to you everything, O twice-born one! on which you verily have any\ndoubt.' Thus addressed by the preceptor, O best of the Kauravas! he who was\ndevoted to the preceptor, put (his) questions with joined bands. Listen to\nthat, O you of great intelligence!\n\nThe pupil said:\n\nWhence am I 1, and whence are you? Explain that which is the highest truth.\nFrom what were the movable and immovable entities born? By what do entities\nlive, and what is the limit of their life? What is truth, what penance, O\nBrahma _n_ a? What are called the qualities by the good? And what paths are\nhappy? What is pleasure, and what sin? These questions of mine, O venerable\nBrahma _n_ a sage! O you of excellent vows! do you be pleased to explain 2\ncorrectly, truly, and accurately. There is none else here who can explain\nthese questions. Speak, O best of those who understand piety! I feel the\nhighest curiosity (in this matter). You are celebrated in the worlds as\nskilled in topics connected with the piety (required for) final emancipation.\nAnd there exists none else but you who can destroy all\n\np. 312\n\ndoubts. And we 1, likewise, are afraid of worldly life, and also desirous of\nfinal emancipation.\n\nVasudeva said:\n\nThat talented preceptor, who preserved (all) vows, O son of P _ri_ tha! O\nchief of the family of the Kauravas! O restrainer of foes! duly explained all\nthose questions to that pupil, who had approached him (for instruction), who\nput (his) questions properly, who was possessed of (the necessary)\nqualifications, who was tranquil, who conducted himself in an agreeable\nmanner, who was like (his) shadow 2, and who was a self-restrained ascetic and\na Brahma _k_ arin.\n\nThe preceptor said:\n\nAll this, which is connected with the knowledge of the Vedas 3 and involves a\nconsideration of the real entity, and which is cultivated by the chief sages,\nwas declared by Brahman. We consider knowledge only as the highest thing; and\nrenunciation 4 as the best penance. And he who understands determinately the\ntrue object of knowledge which is inexpugnable 5\\--the self abiding in all\nentities--and who can move about anywhere 6, is esteemed highest. The learned\nman who perceives the abiding together 7,\n\np. 313\n\nand the severance also, and likewise unity and variety 1, is released from\nmisery. He who does not desire anything, and has no egoism about anything,\nbecomes eligible for assimilation with the Brahman, even while dwelling in\nthis world 2. He who knows the truth about the qualities of nature, who\nunderstands the creation of all entities, who is devoid of (the thought that\nthis or that is) mine, and who is devoid of egoism, is emancipated; there is\nno doubt of that. Accurately understanding the great (tree) of which the\nunperceived 3 is the sprout from the seed, which consists of the understanding\nas its trunk, the branches of which are the great egoism, in the holes of\nwhich are the sprouts, namely, the senses, of which the great elements are the\nflower-bunches 4, the gross elements the smaller boughs, which is always\npossessed of leaves, always possessed of flowers, and from which pleasant\nfruits are always produced, on which all entities subsist, which is eternal,\nand the seed of which is the Brahman; and cutting it with that excellent\nsword-knowledge-one attains immortality, and casts off birth and death 5. I\nwill state to you to-day, O highly\n\np. 314\n\ntalented one! the true conclusion 1 about the past, the present, the future,\nand so forth, and piety, desire, and wealth 2, which is understood by the\nmultitudes of Siddhas, which belongs to olden times, and is eternal, which\nought to be apprehended, and understanding which talented men have here\nattained perfection. Formerly 3, the sages, B _ri_ haspati, Bharadva _g_ a,\nGautama, and likewise Bhargava, Vasish _th_ a, and also Ka _s_ yapa, and Vi\n_s_ vamitra, and Atri also, desiring knowledge, met each other, after having\ntravelled over all paths 4, and becoming wearied of their own actions. And\nthose twice-born (sages), giving the lead to the old sage \xc3\x82 _n_ girasa, saw\nBrahman, from whom (all) sin has departed, in Brahman's mansion. Having\nsaluted that high-souled one who was sitting at ease, the great sages, full of\nhumility, asked him this momentous (question) concerning the highest good:\n'How should one perform good action? how is one released from sin? what paths\nare happy for us? what is truth and what vice? By what action are the two\npaths southern and northern obtained 5? (and what is) destruction 6 and\nemancipation, the birth and death of entities?' What the grandsire said\nconformably to the scriptures 7,\n\np. 315\n\nwhen thus spoken to by the sages, I will state to you. Listen (to that) O\npupil!\n\nBrahman said:\n\nFrom the truth were the entities movable and immovable produced. They live by\npenance 1. Understand that, O you of excellent vows! By their own action they\nremain transcending their own source 2. For the truth joined with the\nqualities is invariably of five varieties. The Brahman 3 is the truth; penance\nis the truth; Pra _g_ apati also is truth; the entities are born from the\ntruth; the universe consisting of (all) creatures is the truth. Therefore\nBrahma _n_ as whose final goal is always concentration of mind, from whom\nanger and vexation have departed, and who are invariably devoting themselves\nto piety, are full of the truth. I will speak about those (Brahma _n_ as) who\nare restrained by one another 4, who are possessed of knowledge, who are the\nestablishers of the bridge of piety, and who are the constant creators of the\npeople 5. I will speak of the four (branches of knowledge, and likewise of the\ncastes, and of the four orders, distinctly. The wise always speak of piety as\none, (but) having\n\np. 316\n\nfour quarters. I will speak to you, O twice-born ones! of the happy path,\nwhich is productive of pleasure, and which has been invariably travelled over.\nby talented men in old days for (obtaining) assimilation with the Brahman.\nLearn, O noble ones! from me, now speaking exhaustively, of that highest path\nwhich is difficult to understand, and of the highest seat. The first step is\nsaid to be the order of Brahma _k_ arins; the second is that of householders;\nnext after that is that of foresters; and next after that too, the highest\nstep must be understood to be that relating to the Adhyatma 1. Light 2, space,\nsun, air, Indra, Pra _g_ apati, one sees not these, while one does not attain\nto the Adhyatma 3. I will subsequently state the means to that, which you\nshould understand. The order of foresters, (the order) of the sages who dwell\nin forests and live on fruits roots and air, is prescribed for the three\ntwice-born (castes). The order of householders is prescribed for all castes.\nThe talented ones speak of piety as having faith for its characteristic. Thus\nhave I described to you the paths leading to the gods 4, which are occupied by\ngood and talented men by means of their actions, and which are bridges of\npiety. He who, rigid in his vows, takes up any one of these modes of piety\nseparately, always comes in time to perceive the production and dissolution of\n\np. 317\n\n(all) entities [1](sbe0848.htm#fn_1516). Now I shall state with accuracy and\nwith reasons, all the elements which abide in parts in all objects. The great\nself [2](sbe0848.htm#fn_1517), the unperceived [3](sbe0848.htm#fn_1518)\nlikewise, and likewise also egoism, the ten senses and the one\n[4](sbe0848.htm#fn_1519) (sense), and the five great elements, and the\nspecific characteristics of the five elements [5](sbe0848.htm#fn_1520), such\nis the eternal creation. The number of the elements is celebrated as being\ntwenty-four plus one. And the talented man who understands the production and\ndissolution of (all) elements, he, of all beings, never comes by delusion. He\nwho accurately understand the elements, the whole of the qualities\n[6](sbe0848.htm#fn_1521), and also all the deities [7](sbe0848.htm#fn_1522),\ncasting aside sin, and getting rid of all bonds, attains to all the spotless\nworlds.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[310:1](sbe0846.htm#fr_1487) I. e. after the identification of the individual\nself with the universal self, when the individual ceases to be perceived as\nsuch. Cf. _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 187, st. 23.\n\n[310:2](sbe0846.htm#fr_1488) That beyond Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1as = the absolute\nsupreme self. Cf. Gita, [p. 206](sbe0827.htm#page_206).\n\n[310:3](sbe0846.htm#fr_1489) The substance of this speech, says Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra, is that the mind and understanding devoted to the supreme lead to\nfinal emancipation.\n\n[310:4](sbe0847.htm#fr_1490) See [p. 296](sbe0841.htm#page_296) supra. The\nlast chapter closes what in some of the MSS. is called the Brahma Gita, or\nBrahma _n_ a Gita contained in the Anugita Parvan. See further as to this our\nIntroduction, where the point is further dwelt on.\n\n[311:1](sbe0847.htm#fr_1491) Compare the questions at the beginning of the _S_\nveta _s_ vatara-upanishad.\n\n[311:2](sbe0847.htm#fr_1492) A similar expression to that in the Sanatsu _g_\natiya, [p. 149](sbe0822.htm#page_149), and elsewhere.\n\n[312:1](sbe0847.htm#fr_1493) It is not easy to account for the change here\nfrom the singular to the plural.\n\n[312:2](sbe0847.htm#fr_1494) I. e. always attended on the preceptor. Cf.\ngenerally, Mu _n_ daka, p. 283.\n\n[312:3](sbe0847.htm#fr_1495) The question was not quite from his own\nimagination, says Nilaka _nth_ a. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra has a different\nreading, which he interprets to mean 'that on which the Vedas are all at one.'\n\n[312:4](sbe0847.htm#fr_1496) Of the fruit of action, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[312:5](sbe0847.htm#fr_1497) I. e. not such as to require modification by any\nother knowledge, as knowledge of the world does.\n\n[312:6](sbe0847.htm#fr_1498) Nilaka _nth_ a compares _Kh_ andogya, pp.\n523-553.\n\n[312:7](sbe0847.htm#fr_1499) I. e. of K _i_ t and _G_ a _d_ a, says Nilaka\n_nth_ a; of Brahman and its manifestations, as alluded to, inter alia, at pp.\n[105](sbe0815.htm#page_105), [106](sbe0815.htm#page_106),\n[191](sbe0826.htm#page_191) supra.\n\n[313:1](sbe0847.htm#fr_1500) I. e. that variety is only in this world, but\nthat the unity of everything is the true proposition. Cf. inter alia Gita, [p.\n104](sbe0815.htm#page_104).\n\n[313:2](sbe0847.htm#fr_1501) Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 858, and Gita, [p.\n65](sbe0807.htm#page_65).\n\n[313:3](sbe0847.htm#fr_1502) I. e. the Prak _ri_ ti of the Sankhyas.\n\n[313:4](sbe0847.htm#fr_1503) The great elements are the five tanmatras of\nearth, water, fire, air, and space, which afterwards produce what we have\ncalled the gross elements in the text, namely, the earth &c. which we\nperceive.\n\n[313:5](sbe0847.htm#fr_1504) The tree typifies worldly life. Cf. pp.\n[111](sbe0817.htm#page_111)-[189](sbe0826.htm#page_189) supra. The leaves and\nflowers, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, stand for volition and action; and Nilaka\n_nth_ a seems to agree. The tree is called eternal, as worldly life is\nsupposed to have had no beginning. Cf. Sariraka Bhashya, p. 494, 'sprout from\nthe seed,' this rendering is necessitated by Brahman being described as the\nseed. Cf. Mundaka, p. 288; _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 362; Ka _th_ a, pp. 143,\n144.\n\n[314:1](sbe0847.htm#fr_1505) I. e. the means of arriving at it, Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra.\n\n[314:2](sbe0847.htm#fr_1506) The triad, the acquisition of which worldly men\naspire to.\n\n[314:3](sbe0847.htm#fr_1507) He explains how the doctrine belongs to olden\ntimes.\n\n[314:4](sbe0847.htm#fr_1508) I.e. paths of action, Nilaka _nth_ a. See Sanatsu\n_g_ atiya, [p. 165](sbe0824.htm#page_165).\n\n[314:5](sbe0847.htm#fr_1509) Namely, the Pit _ri_ yana and Devayana (Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra), as to which see _Kh_ andogya, p. 341, Kaushitaki, p. 13, and B\n_ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 1034.\n\n[314:6](sbe0847.htm#fr_1510) Nilaka _nth_ a seems to interpret this to mean\nthe temporary and final dissolutions of the worlds, on which see, inter alia,\nVedanta Paribhasha, p. 48.\n\n[314:7](sbe0847.htm#fr_1511) So Nilaka _nth_ a. May it not be 'according to\nthe received tradition?'\n\n[315:1](sbe0847.htm#fr_1512) I. e. by action, Nilaka _nth_ a. Cf. Mu _nd_ aka,\np. 280, and see [p. 166](sbe0824.htm#page_166) supra, note .\n\n[315:2](sbe0847.htm#fr_1513) I. e. they remain apart from the Brahman, being\nengaged in action. This answers some of the questions put by the pupil to the\npreceptor. As to 'the truth,' see [p. 162](sbe0823.htm#page_162), note\n[2](sbe0824.htm#fn_706) supra.\n\n[315:3](sbe0847.htm#fr_1514) I. e. \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, or god; penance = piety; Pra\n_g_ apati = the individual soul, Nilaka _nth_ a. Brahman = 'that' (but how is\n'that' 'joined with qualities?'); Pra _g_ apati = Brahman, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra. They agree about penance and entities (which they take to mean the gross\nelements) and creatures. Brahman and Pra _g_ apati = Vira _g_ and Hira _n_\nyagarbha (?), [p. 186](sbe0826.htm#page_186) supra. Cf. Santi Parvan (Moksha),\nchap. 190, st. 1.\n\n[315:4](sbe0847.htm#fr_1515) I. e. who commit no breach of piety through fear\nof one another, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[315:5](sbe0847.htm#fr_1516) Cf. Gita, [p. 86](sbe0811.htm#page_86).\n\n[316:1](sbe0847.htm#fr_1517) That is to say, that of the ascetic, who\nspecially devotes himself to the acquisition of knowledge about the relation\nof the supreme and individual self (Adhyatma).\n\n[316:2](sbe0847.htm#fr_1518) The deity presiding over the bright fortnight,\nsays Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. The words space and sun and air must be similarly\ninterpreted.\n\n[316:3](sbe0847.htm#fr_1519) Nilaka _nth_ a says 'one sees these only while\none has not had a perception of the self.' He takes light &c. to mean the\n'universe.'\n\n[316:4](sbe0847.htm#fr_1520) I. e. the means of reaching the Devayana path\n(mentioned at p. 314 note  5), Nilaka _nth_ a. Cf. also Mu _nd_ aka. p. 312.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXI](sbe0848.htm)\n\n"
