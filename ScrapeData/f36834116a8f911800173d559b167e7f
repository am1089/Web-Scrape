We feel the very presence of\nsome persons as if it were the translation of poems from a foreign tongue.\nEvery profound truth waits for the life that shall be all its voice, and when\nthat is found it comes within the reach of multitudes to whom it would have\nremained inaccessible.\n\nBut we cannot find truth in a word, unless it is illumined by our own\nexperience. That statement which we have lived but have not spoken, even to\nourselves, when uttered by another\'s lips, we hail as revelation. And that\nalone. What we have ourselves once said seems commonplace, and that which is\ntoo far above we do not understand.\n\nSo it happens that the interpreter, the poet, must be for ever telling to the\nworld those things of which it has already won heart-knowledge. This is the\nsign that we demand always from the messenger--that he speak of a common\nmemory. And to him who does this we listen gladly, believing that life will\nyet\n\np. 44\n\nbring the significance of those words of his that do not, for the nonce,\nexplain themselves to us.\n\nHighest of all the poets stands the saint. His task is not to take the\nbrilliant patches of love, and sorrow and heroism, and fit them into jewelled\nsettings for the admiration of the many. He takes the whole of life, all the\ngrey, sombre stuff of which it is chiefly made, and the blackest and the\nbrightest with this, and throws on the whole a new light, till even in the\neyes of those who suffer it, life is made beautiful. The dramatist deals only\nwith dramatic motives, but to him all is dramatic. The petty needs of\nchildhood are no less related to the World-Heart than the passion by which\nOthello slays Desdemona.\n\nBut that new tune to which he sets the old song of living has to be caught in\nsnatches from the people, a note here and a cadence there. The mother crooning\nher babe to rest, or wailing beside it in its last long sleep; the man panting\nfor his adversary, or finding himself inadequate\n\np. 45\n\nto the protection of those he loves; the peasant guiding the plough with\npatient strength, the child-folk playing in the sunlight, all these have\nwhispered him in the ear, and taught him the whole of their mystic lore.\n\nIt is not then the voice of the prophet, but the great heart of the vulgar,\nthat brings a new religious intuition to the birth. All that violence and\ngesticulation that repel us, are but the dim experimental utterance of an\nimpulse not yet fully conscious of itself.\n\nIt is when the idea has been elaborated in this way by the imagination and\nconscience of the myriads, that there arises a man who seems to embody it in\nhis own person. And he is hailed as Master and Teacher by all, because he\ninterprets their own lives, and speaks the words that already they were\nstruggling to express. He is the crest of the wave, but all these are the wave\nitself.\n\nBorn thus of his nation\'s life, and speaking straight to its heart was\n\np. 46\n\n[paragraph continues] Ram Prasad, the great Bengali poet of the Motherhood of\nGod. Not a century has passed since a crowd stood with him by the Ganges-side,\nlistening to his recital of his own finest work. As he pronounced the last\nwords the old man exclaimed, "It is achieved," and on the moment died. It was\nnot death. It was translation. And the people feel that it happened yesterday.\n\nHe had begun life as a book-keeper, and no doubt tried, when he remembered\nthem, to perform his duties faithfully. But when at the end of a week his\nemployer called for his books, he found on the first page a sonnet\nbeginning--"Mother! make me thine accountant. I shall never prove defaulter,"\nand verses scribbled all over the accounts. One cry, "Mother! Mother!" rang\nthrough every line, and as the Hindu does not live who cannot understand a\nreligious freak, his genius was recognised at once. A small pension was\nsettled on him, and he was set free from wage earning for the rest of his\nlife.\n\np. 47\n\nThe result is a collection of folk-songs, full of the sentiment of Kali-\nworship, left to the memories of his people. Many it is to be feared, remain\nabout the villages of Bengal, unrecorded to this day. But they are so integral\na part of the life that there is good reason to trust that they will never be\nlost.\n\nIn after days, Ram Prasad became famous. Drifting down the Ganges one summer\nday, his little boat encountered the royal barge of Surajah Dowlah, the\nbrilliant young governor of Bengal, and he was ordered to come on board and\nsing. The poet tuned his vina, and racked his brain for songs in the grand old\nclassic style, fine enough to suit the presence. But the Mohammedan would have\nnone of them--"Sing me your own songs--About the Mother!" he commanded\ngraciously, and his subject was only too glad to obey.\n\nNo flattery could touch a nature so unapproachable in its simplicity. For in\nthese writings we have perhaps alone in literature, the\n\np. 48\n\nspectacle of a great poet, whose genius is spent in realising; the emotions of\na child. William Blake, in our own poetry, strikes the note that is nearest\nhis, and Blake is by no means his peer.\n\nRobert Burns in his splendid indifference to rank, and Whitman in his\nglorification of common things, have points of kinship with him. But to such a\nradiant white-heat of child-likeness, it would be impossible to find a perfect\ncounterpart. His years do nothing to spoil this quality. They only serve to\ngive him self-confidence and poise. Like a child he is now grave, now gay,\nsometimes petulant, sometimes despairing. But in the child all this is\npurposeless: in Ram Prasad there is a deep intensity of purpose. Every\nsentence he has uttered is designed to sing the glory of his Mother.\n\nFor all his simplicity, however, our author is not to be understood without an\neffort. Nor need this surprise us. It takes the whole history of Rome and\nFlorence to\n\np. 49\n\nmake the Divina Commedia comprehensible. In fact we can never understand any\npoet without some knowledge of the culture that produced him, and what is true\nof Dante may be expected to prove still more applicable to one who is removed\nfrom us by oceans and continents, as well as by the complex civilising\ncenturies.\n\nIndeed it may be questioned whether the apparent artlessness of Oriental\nexpression is not always somewhat misleading. Into four lines of landscape, we\nare told, the Chino-Japanese can slip the whole theory of his national\nexistence, without ever a European suspecting double purpose; and much the\nsame is the case with the Hindu. A wealth of such associations goes for\ninstance to the appreciation of the great line describing the mountain-forests\nagainst the snow,--"They make eternal sati on the body of Mahadev."\n\nWhat is said of the Japanese artist is pre-eminently true of Ram Prasad, only\nit is in the broken toys\n\np. 50\n\nand April shower and sunshine of a child\'s moods that he hides the mysteries\nof the universe.\n\nApart from his passion of devotion to the Divine Motherhood, there is a whole\nconception of life in his mind which is unfamiliar to us. The East takes such\nan utterance as "the pure in heart shall _see_ God" very literally. It places\nthe ideal existence, not in salvation--or in the condition of being delivered\nfrom sinfulness--but in this very power of direct perception of the Divine.\n\nIt seems to the Asiatic mind that the body is an actual hindrance to\ncognition. It is not that meaning is conveyed by language, but that mind is\ndrawn near to mind. In unskilled speech, words may serve only to conceal\nthought, but in the most skilled they cannot do more than suggest it. Nerves\ndo not create suffering, for the joy and sorrow that we share in imagination\ncan be far keener than our own. And so this convention, of sight--sound--touch\n--taste--smell, under\n\np. 51\n\nwhich we become aware of the not-myself, is merely a formula which deadens the\nReal for us till we are strong enough to bear it; and we must stay in the\nbody, or return to it, till we have in some way mastered these conditions.\n\nWhen limitation is broken, however, when every dim stratum and substratum of\nour being has become conscious, and the whole consciousness is gathered up\ninto the single tremendous act of knowledge,--not the conventionalised,\nformulated awareness of the senses, but direct absolute knowledge,--what is it\nclaimed that we perceive? That which came before as many, as seeing and\nhearing and the rest, is known now to be One, and that One--God.\n\nAnd so it happens that the great goal of Eastern religion is known as Mukti or\nNirvana, or Freedom. The man in whom this perception is perfected is liberated\nfrom conditions--he may subject himself to them at will, but he is not bound\nby them. He has left the sleep of\n\np. 52\n\nignorance behind him, and is for ever awake. Says Ram Prasad:--\n\n"From the land where there is no night  \n     Has come One unto me.  \nAnd night and day are now nothing to me,  \nRitual-worship has become for ever barren.\n\nMy sleep is broken. Shall I sleep any more?  \nCall it what you will--I am awake--  \nHush! I have given back sleep unto Him whose it was.  \nSleep have I put to sleep for ever.\n\nThe music has entered the instrument,  \nAnd of that mode I have learnt a song.  \nAh! that music is playing ever before me,  \nFor concentration is the great teacher thereof.  \nPrasad speaks--Understand, O Soul, these words of Wisdom."\n\nBut the great burden of his verses is the Mother. And in calling upon Her he\nbecomes the ideal child. It is curious to reflect how a century and a half\nago, almost a hundred years before the birth of childhood into European art, a\ngreat Indian singer and saint should have been deep in observation of the\nlittle ones--studying them, and\n\np. 53\n\nsharing every feeling, almost without knowing it himself.\n\nOnce, indeed, he seems to justify himself--\n\n"Whom else should I cry to, Mother?  \nThe baby cries for its mother alone--  \nAnd I am not the son of such  \nThat I should call any woman my mother!\n\nTho\' the mother beat him,  \nThe child cries \'Mother, O Mother!\'  \nAnd clings still tighter to her garment.\n\nTrue I cannot see Thee,  \nYet am I not a lost child!  \nI still cry \'Mother, Mother!\'\n\nBut indignant pride gives way to secret despair, mingled with an angry\nimpatience. God must be dead--no living mother could so long resist a baby\'s\ncries. He will hold a funeral in effigy, and retire from the world for ever.\n\n"Mind, stop calling \'Mother, Mother!\'"  \nDon\'t you know She is dead?--  \nElse why should She not come?\n\nI am going to the banks of the Ganges,  \nTo burn the grass image of my Mother,  \nAnd then I\'ll go and live in Benares."\n\nWhen the question of his going\n\np. 54\n\non pilgrimage, however, is seriously mooted, he makes a reply of wonderful\nbeauty and profundity. Naughty as he is, he does not want to go, and is\nwilling to support himself with reasons. Doubt leads to doubt and a frown\nculminates in a supreme defiance:--\n\n"Why should I go to Benares?  \nMy Mother\'s lotus-feet  \nAre millions and millions  \nOf holy places.\n\nThe books say, man dying in Benares  \nAttains Nirvana.  \nI believe it. Siva has said it.  \nBut the root of all is devotion  \nAnd freedom is her slave.  \nWhat good is there even in Nirvana?  \nMixing water with water--!  \nSee I do not care to _become_ sugar,  \nI want to _eat_ sugar!"\n\nWhat a flash is in those last two lines The shrewd mother-wit of a peasant\njoins with the insight of a great poet, not only to express the finest of fine\nemotions--the joy of being the inferior, but to hint in the same words, at the\nsecret of existence.\n\nQuaint beyond quaintness is the\n\np. 55\n\nsong of the kite-flying. To the child mind it is quite natural that its mother\nshould play with its toys. All mothers do so. And now Kali becomes the\nplaymate. Her toy is the Indian kite, of which the string is covered with\npowdered glass that it may cut through others. But the boy forgets his game,\nso completely is it She that fascinates him. He breaks away and looks on with\ngrave joy at Her, while his lips involuntarily frame a song. It is the game of\nlife, that is played before him; the kite released is the soul, gone to\nfreedom; and still the Mother laughs and plays on, as if She knew not that all\nthese were shadows:--\n\n"In the market place of this world,  \nThe Mother sits flying Her kite.  \nIn a hundred thousand,  \nShe cuts the string of one or two.  \nAnd when the kite soars up into the Infinite  \nOh how She laughs and claps her hands!"\n\nAgain he is making a mystery out of nothing, playing hide and seek, as babies\nlove to do.\n\np. 56\n\n"The name of Her whom I call my Mother, shall I tell that secret to the\nworld?" he says (lit. "Shall I break the pot before the market?") "Even then\nwho knows Her? Lo, the six philosophies were not able to find out Kali!"\n\nThat is almost the only simile in which he ceases to be a child, when he\nadjures himself to "Dive deep, O soul, taking the name of Kali!" into that\nocean of beauty from which he is to bring up the lustrous pearl.\n\nSo much then for the art-form in which this worship of tender appeal has been\nenshrined. To the Hindu mind the poet\'s familiarity with his Mother makes him\nnot only dear and great, but infinitely devout. It proves, as did the repartee\nof S. Theresa, that God is more real to him than the objects and persons that\nwe see about us daily. Is it not true that a soul so close to the Divine might\nwell have been that child who was taken on Christ\'s knee when He said:--"Of\nsuch is the kingdom of heaven."\n\np. 57\n\nIt is not as the interpreter of man\'s love to God, but as the great\nIncarnation of the spirit of the Mother towards Her children, that we pass on\nand kneel at the feet of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa.\n\nHere is one who has but lately gone out from amongst us. Less than twenty\nyears ago he was teaching in the Temple-Garden of Dukineshwar, near Calcutta.\nAnd so large loomed the Divine through him, that many of those who knew and\nloved him then, speak his name to this day with bated breath, calling him,\n"Our Lord."\n\nFor in the case of Ramakrishna, innumerable prayers and unheard-of austerities\nhad culminated in a realisation so profound that there was scarcely a memory\nof selfhood left. The man who lived and moved before his disciples was a mere\nshell, that could not fail to act as the indwelling motherhood willed. He\nnever used, it is said, the expression "I" and "mine," preferring "He who\ndwells here" (indicating His\n\np. 58\n\nown heart), or usually "My holy Mother."\n\nThat his original phyisque must have been extraordinary, we can infer, since\nit stood the strain under which his religious yearning hurried it, for fifty-\nthree years. But far more wonderful was the complexity and many sidedness of\ncharacter and of development, that made him feel the perplexities of every\nheart as if they were his own. His was, probably, the one really universal\nmind of modern times. Yet the whole was wrought to such a unity that the peace\nof it tills to this day the little chamber where he dwelt, and abides like a\nmighty presence under the great tree of meditation. That little room, how\npoor, even to meanness, it looked when I last saw it!\n\nIt was night, and a tiny lamp--a cup of oil with a floating wick--illumined\nthe exquisite purity of bed-linen and the fresh flowers placed by faithful\nhands before the Master\'s picture. The lamp was lifted, and the long shadows\nseemed\n\np. 59\n\nto come down, from some dim upper abode, and prostrate themselves in worship.\nAll was as he had used it, the lounge beside the bed, a huge water jar in one\ncorner, a few religious pictures on the walls and nothing more. Outside the\nheavy rain of June fell steadily, and below the terrace the Ganges moaned and\nhastened on. I have seen it in other moods--seen it when the oleanders nodded\nand whispered to the roses on the terrace, when the great mango groves behind\nwere full of blossoms, and the clang of the bells for evening worship broke\nthe silence to make the place like a smile at time of prayer. And I have seen\nit in the terror of an Indian noon, full of coolness and flower fragrance. But\nnever did it look so poor as that June night, and never was poverty made so\nbeautiful.\n\nHere great scholars and potentates have been proud to be received--"And they\nseemed," said one who was often present, "like children before our Lord!\n\np. 60\n\nHe, at least knew nothing of the difference made by wealth and learning in the\nworld. He dismissed the most important man of his district with a frown from\nhis presence because he stood upon his riches and his name; he would leave\ncompanies of distinguished persons to themselves; and he would spend hours\nlistening to the confidences of an anxious woman about her home, or in the\ninstruction of some nameless lad. Yet his touch fell on none lightly. A great\npreacher, known to the West as to the East, changed his teaching when he knew\nhim, in this new thought of the Motherhood of God. And many of the strongest\nmen in India to-day, sat at his feet in their boy-hood. An unlettered peasant,\nfrom the Brahmins of the villages, scarcely able to read and write he seemed,\nyet if original thought and wide reading are enough, he was a profound\nscholar. For he had a remarkable ear and memory that made him retain the\nsounds of the Sanskrit perfectly, with the translation,\n\np. 61\n\nand as a vast quantity of literature was read and recited to him from time to\ntime, he had acquired in this way an uncommonly large store.\n\nIn those years of which we are now speaking, the last twenty of his life, he\nwas a great light, known as a saint throughout Bengal, the North-West\nProvinces and Nepal, and much visited, in the informal Eastern way. Men felt\nthemselves in his presence to be dealing with forces that they could not\n[gauge](errata.htm#0), drawing on wisdom which they were unable to fathom. As\nif he were great music, they touched there the state that mighty music hints\nat, and went away saner, sweeter, stronger to their daily tasks.\n\nYet all this time his real inner life was lived amongst that group of young\nmen who had foresworn the common motives of existence, to call themselves his\ndisciples. He was rarely without one or two in immediate attendance, and many\nwere with him day and night for weeks and months together.\n\np. 62\n\nSome were mere boys, and it was fitting that laughter and frolic should make a\nlarge part of the life together. Their Master was never sad. A gentle gaiety\nseemed the very air he breathed, broken indeed by the constant trance of\nrapture, and by the wonderful inspiration of his mood afterwards. "When it is\nnight to all beings, then is the man of self-control awake: when all beings\nare awake, then is the night of the man of knowledge," he would chant, waking\nthem during the dark hours to come out and meditate in the starlight, while\nmany a day was spent swinging on the elephant creeper that his own hands had\nplanted, amidst laughter and picnicking in the garden. The stream of days\nflowed on, without apparent plan or purpose,--yet all unnoticed a few leading\nideas were being insisted on; a story here and there was building up the\nknowledge of that tremendous struggle through which he had attained to peace;\nthey were watching him deal with men and things: above all, they\n\np. 63\n\nwere bathing in that Ocean of the Real to which his presence was a perpetual\naccess.\n\nAnd is not this the wisest of all teaching, to make sure of essentials, and\nleave the minds of the instructed to work out their own results, like the\nyoung plant growing up from seed? For we may be sure of one thing,--the order\nthat is imposed upon us may become geometrical, but only the order that we\ncreate ourselves can become organic. It was the old Indian ideal of a\nuniversity, to live in the forest with the Master and realise the meaning of\nculture in the touch of his personality.\n\nThese men to whom Ramakrishna Paramahamsa entrusted the mission and teaching\nof his "Divine Mother"--for he never dreamt of them as his own,--were chiefly\ngraduates from the neighbouring colleges, many of them deeply tinged with the\nWestern reaction which was the temper of that day. The distance between them\nand Christianity was shorter than would\n\np. 64\n\nnow seem possible. They were touched by its evidence of purity and enthusiasm\nfor humanity, and full of a very genuine love for the New Testament.\nOccidental influences had stirred them to ideas of patriotism otherwise\nforeign to the Hindu temperament. They were looking for great things from the\nadoption of a more European taste and style of living. Above all, they had\nconceived the idea that India was being ruined by idolatry, and that the one\nthing incumbent on them was to do what in them lay, to sweep away every image\nand relic of degraded superstition, and to work for her emancipation from\ncaste, from the zenana system, and from whatever else had till now been\nconsidered her distinctive institutions.\n\nSpeaking broadly, many of the finest minds of the Indian universities of that\ntime felt thus, and these young disciples of Ramakrishna were among their\nfollowing.\n\nSuddenly they found themselves face to face with this ascetic saint of\n\np. 65\n\nthe old orthodox Hindu pattern. Gentle, without solemnity or affectation, full\nof humour, living in his garden almost nude, knowing little of the English\nsave on hearsay, as a queer folk from overseas, the old man held them by a\nspell they could neither analyse nor break.\n\nHis perfect sincerity and gigantic purity made themselves felt even by youth,\nbut against his intellect some made a desperate resistance. Long, long after,\none of them said, "I was always looking for something that would prove him to\nbe holy! It took me six years to understand that _he was not holy_ , because\nhe had become holiness itself!"\n\nHe was glad to hear all they could tell him of the Bible. Christianity was in\nthe air in those days, and he had loved Christ and worshipped Him long before\nthey came to him; but he bated no jot of his own devotion to Kali. "As sugar,"\nhe said, "is made into various figures of birds and beasts, so one sweet\nMother Divine is worshipped in various climes and ages under\n\np. 66\n\nvarious name and forms. Different creeds are but different paths to reach the\nSupreme."\n\nThe ritual of Kali-worship is the only existing provision in India for animal\nsacrifice. This means something entirely different from the Jewish notion of\npropitiation. There is no idea whatever of making compensation for sin: the\nwhole intention is to offer meat-food first to the Mother, for Her use and\nblessing. No meat is eaten by [the](errata.htm#1) orthodox Hindu without being\nconsecrated in this way, whether he be otherwise a Kali-worshipper or not. But\nthe Anglicised portion of the community, while consuming vastly more animal\nfood than their conservative brethren, take great exception to these\npreliminaries, and have perhaps concentrated on this particular creed in\nconsequence, all the horror with which idolatry as a whole inspires them.\nThese were the associations of the disciples with Her whom their Master called\nhis "Divine Mother."\n\nBut it was not Kali only: there\n\np. 67\n\nwas not a symbol in India that he had not worshipped and did not love; not a\nworshipper, by whatever rite, whose special need he had not felt in his own\nnature, and borne till it was satisfied; not a prayer, or ecstasy, or vision\nthat he did not reverence and understand, giving it its true place in a\ngrowing knowledge.\n\nHis was in fact the most perfect religious culture that the mind can conceive.\nThe doctrine that "different creeds are but different paths to reach God,"\npropounded in a general way, was not new in India. But taught as this man\ntaught it, with his strong contention that it was the actual duty of men to\nfollow their own faith, for the world gained by many-centredness; with his\nintense conviction "in whatsoever name or form you desire to know God, in that\nvery name and form you will see Him;" with his assurance that rites and\nceremonies contain religious experience, as the husk contains the germ; and\nabove all, with that love that said\n\np. 68\n\nof every faith, "Bow down and adore where others kneel, for where so many have\nworshipped, the Lord will manifest Himself."--it was unique in the world\'s\nhistory.\n\nTo those who have learnt even [a](errata.htm#2) little of the authenticity of\nthe religious consciousness, it is not difficult to see intellectually that\ncreeds may bear to each other the relation of contemporary languages, all\nexpressive of that one consciousness. But Ramakrishna in the garden of the\nKali-temple, was a direct embodiment of the impulse to speak to each in his\nown language and tell him how to reach the goal. In this man\'s love there was\nno limitation anywhere. Let one be sincere, and neither race, nor history, nor\nstage of developement could cut him off. Each who came to him had his own\nplace given to him, and kept it. His longing was for the salvation of every\nsoul in a whole world. A universe from which one, most insignificant, was\nmissing, could not have seemed perfect in his eyes.\n\np. 69\n\nLove such as this carries all hearts at last. Only such love deserves the name\nof God the Mother.\n\nHe was entirely abandoned to this great passion. There was nothing in him that\nremembered anything else. In the long years of self-discipline he had knelt to\nworship the very lowest, doing menial service for them with his own hands; in\nthe last days of his life when he lay dying of cancer in the throat and speech\nwas agony, he would insist on teaching all who came to him for help.\n\nThis was the secret that his disciples learnt by degrees. But on the outside,\nhow free from display it was!\n\nThe old man sits chatting quietly with his boys. Now, with a twinkle of the\neyes, he gives worldly advice to one--"Raise the hood (alluding to the cobra),\nbut do not bite!" Again in a deeper moment, "There are thirty-six letter in\nthe alphabet, and three of them, say \'suffer.\'" (Bengali has three s\'s, which\nare so pronounced).\n\np. 70\n\nEverything taught its lesson, even the folklore of the district, and the\nquaint superstitions of the un-educated. In Ramakrishna\'s eyes, doubtless,\nmuch of human learning was on a level at bottom with the legend of the\nphilosopher\'s stone; but let a man see to it that he touched the feet of God,\nand what ever was his would become pure gold. Little incidents that occurred\nwould all become the text of some remark, often of great profundity. Even a\nhalf-cooked vegetable would furnish a metaphor, it was like the aspirant who,\nfalling short of perfection, is not yet all humility and tenderness. The bell,\nwhose distinct strokes could be heard from the neighbouring temple die away\ninto a long common vibration would remind him that God is both with form and\nwithout form too, and He is that which transcends form and formlessness.\n\nThere was wit too. All the saintliness in the world would not prevent a laugh\nat the man who was so indifferent to [worldly](errata.htm#3) interests\n\nthat he permitted his wife to limit his charities.\n\nAnd then, even as he talked with them, something would stir him deeper. A\ngreat light would cone on his face, and he would pass, as they, awed, sat and\nwatched, into the state of divine ecstasy, the inner vision of the Mother.\n\nSo, day by day, unutterable love and burning renunciation were woven into the\ntexture of their lives, till one exclaimed, "It was not what he taught us, but\nthat life that we lived with him! And that can never he told!"\n\nAt last came a summer night towards the time of full moon, when his disciples\ngathered round him, perceiving him to be passing into that beatitude from\nwhich there would be no return.\n\nEven at that moment he rose suddenly to answer a thought in the mind of one.\nAnd then he left them, while one, whose music he had loved, chanted over him\nthe name of God.\n\nLater, in the dark, came a\n\np. 72\n\nwoman, sitting at his feet crying softly, and calling him "Mother." It was\nthat disciple who had been his wife.\n\nDuring their after lives, when the boys had become men, and had begun to carry\nthe message of their great Teacher far and near, they found that nothing he\nhad given them was more precious than the story of his own early struggle and\nattainment. With the outer circumstances of his boyhood they were familiar,\nhaving mixed freely with his relatives and village neighbours, whenever these\nchose to visit Dukineshwar.\n\nIndia is probably the one country in the world where a man can he awake to the\nmeaning of his life from his infancy without having a whole growth of\nsuperstitions become heart of his heart at the same time. No doubt\nsuperstition is there, but it is possible for it to drop away imperceptibly\nas, to use Ramakrishna\'s own expression, the dried petals drop from the\nripening fruit.\n\np. 73\n\nIn this sense he seems to have been awake from the beginning. He had inherited\nthe long-garnered knowledge of his race, that religion is no matter of belief\nbut of experience. The worship of the Great God of Getting-on disgusted him;\nand he longed to attain the sweetness of Divine Union even in boyhood. With\nall this, he kept caste strictly, and without thought of personal comfort.\n\nAt twenty years of age, however, all these elements became absorbed in one\nsupreme desire. Pressure of many circumstances had assigned to him the duty of\nacting as assistant priest in the Kali-temple at Dukineshwar. We must think\nhow it would work on a strongly religious temperament to find itself set apart\nfor the service of God. We must remember also that the utterances of Ram\nPrasad and many another devotee of Kali were part of the common language of\nthe country. It was as if his chosen way were pointed out to him. It was only\nfor him now to traverse it.\n\np. 74\n\nHis duty was to swing lights and flowers before the image, in the beautiful\narooti ceremony.\n\nBut his whole nature had gone down in passionate yearning for the Mother\nHerself. One question, "Is this real? Is this real?" rang eternally in his\nears. And he could not perform even this simple task efficiently. Sometimes he\nwould swing the lights all day, sometimes he would forget them altogether,\nlost in a maze of agonised supplication.\n\nThe tale went about that he was mad, and as, everywhere, people will try by a\ndose of this world to drive out the other, his relations decided that the\ndistraction of a wedding would give him his only chance of a cure. It was in\nthis way that he was married to a little girl who long afterwards carne to him\nand became one of the greatest of his disciples.\n\nBut a wedding-feast proved no mitigation of a struggle so tremendous, so\noverwhelmingly actual, and he had to be released from his stint\n\np. 75\n\nof work. No doubt he would have been dismissed also from the garden but that\nthe owners of the temple had recognised his genius and protected him.\n\nThe associations of this new period cluster thick round a great banyan-tree,\nand a wooden hut that once stood near it. The tree stands in the wilder part\nof the garden, close to the river, in perfect seclusion. Five stems grow\ntogether, and round the entwined trunk is built a terraced seat of brickwork.\nAt the north-western corner a great bough of the Bo species has grown down\nacross the bench, and tradition says that this covers the exact spot in which\nrealisation was achieved. Be this as it may, the place was the scene of\ncontinuous meditation and austerity for many years. Not that the asceticism\nseems to have been pre-meditated. It would appear rather to have been the\ninevitable result of something deeper. Ramakrishna did not forbid himself to\nsleep or eat, he was unable to do\n\np. 76\n\neither. He did not force himself to neglect his person, he entirely forgot it.\n\nDriven on by his own nature, impelled from within by that irresistible\nnecessity that had called him into being, without one rest or relaxation, for\ntwelve long years at least, he persisted in that inner warfare. Then, at last,\nthe goal was attained. The Mother revealed Herself. From that moment his\npersonality was that of a little child, satisfied that he was in Her arms.\n\n.      .      .      .      .      .\n\nHe had discovered a great secret, when he would break a disposition, he would\nreduce it to a concrete instance, and battle with it there. It was so that he\nhad night after night performed that act of cleansing that was to rid him of\nsocial pride.\n\nNow as he came slowly back to life out of the rapture of Eternal Union, having\nperceived the whole of Nature as himself, he yet, with his quickened senses,\nsaw many elements in human life for which he had not actually traced the path.\n\np. 77\n\n[paragraph continues] And so, one by one, he took these as questions on the\nsimplest plane. Beginning with that worship of Krishna which is related to his\nown as the Catholic Church to the Protestant, he made himself in all ways one\nwith it. He ate and dressed and talked like the lovers of Hari,--and he ended\nby identifying devotion to Krishna with the love of Kali. So it was with\nMohammedanism, and so with Christianity. Amongst his race, the Musselman is\nabhorred, and the dead are regarded as unclean. Yet he lived in a Mohammedan\nburial-ground till his end was achieved. It was not he who did these things.\nIt was that Great Love that he felt within and called his Mother. He was not\nhumble, but he seemed to have forgotten that Ramakrishna had ever been.\n\nThen came the strangest phase of all. He would realise God as a woman! It was\nthe flowering point of a certain tender chivalry that had always marked him,\nand makes his life the true emancipation of Indian\n\np. 78\n\nwomen. His method, here and always, was the same,--to forget his own past and\ncause it to be forgotten. So he made every detail of their lives his own, and\nwent to visit his wife in her village home, that he might find his friends\nentirely amongst her acquaintances and share every joy and sorrow of their\nhearts. Till at last he satisfied himself that the secret victory could also\nbe attained in the straight path of womanhood.\n\nAnd herein surely lies the gist of his life. As a mother\'s love justifies the\nexistence of all her children, however unsympathetically they be judged by\nothers, so he, the embodiment of the World-Mother, would take up whole areas\nof living and assert the place of each in the complete harmony of life.\n\nAnd is it not a great doctrine,--that every man\'s cottage-door stands open on\nsome high-road to the Infinite? Is it not immeasurably consoling, this cry of\n"No more idolatry! No more condemnation!" but to every man where he stands,\n\np. 79\n\nusing the means that lies to his hand--"Fix thine heart upon the Lord thy God,\nand let thine eyes look right on!"\n\nIt was as a seal upon this teaching that whoever came to Ramakrishna\nafterwards went away with profound courage. For the Master put his finger\nalways upon the core of strength, and even his limitations became as wings\nupon the feet to the man so touched.\n\nSo with social customs and public movements, he destroyed no institutions: he\ndid everything to make men and women strong in them. His friendship was given\nunhesitatingly to the leaders of reforming sects, and as readily to the\ndespised artists of the theatre, while at the same time he was worshipped by\nthe orthodox.\n\nAnd yet he appeared quite unconscious of what he did. He seemed to act on\ndivine instinct, like a child, and like a child, to be always superbly right.\nHe was content to live, and leave to others to explain. Long ago, in early\n\np. 80\n\nmanhood, it had been no desire to become a teacher, but the longing to find\nthe Real, that had driven him forth on the supreme quest. Now, it was because\nhe would satisfy his unspeakable yearning over men and women that he tried,\nevery path to find God. Had one been left untrodden, his own soul would have\ngone seeking still. He never became the director of any, for in after life, it\nis said, he could not even imagine himself a teacher. He scattered his\nknowledge broadcast, and each took what he would.\n\nWe learn in him that greatness, and harmony, and beauty are all results. Our\nconcern is not with them, but with those more elemental matters of simplicity\nand sincerity and whole-hearted devotion that lie close to us.\n\nHe is a witness to the world that the old Indian wisdom was not in vain. It is\nof course true that in no other country could he have occurred. But it is not\ntrue that he expresses the mind of India alone, or even chiefly. For in him\nmeet\n\np. 81\n\nthe feeling and thought of all mankind, and he, Ramakrishna, the devotee of\nKali, represents _Humanity_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Voice of the Mother](ktm05.htm)\n\n'
