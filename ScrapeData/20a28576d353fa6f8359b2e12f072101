This conclusion would be almost certain from the\ncharacter of the play, but is put beyond doubt by the following speeches of\nthe prologue:\n\n\n\n_Stage-director_. The audience has asked us to present at this spring festival\na drama called _Malavika and Agnimitra_ , composed by Kalidasa. Let the music\nbegin.\n\nAssistant. No, no! Shall we neglect the works of such illustrious authors as\nBhasa, Saumilla, and Kaviputra? Can the audience feel any respect for the work\nof a modern poet, a Kalidasa?\n\n_Stage-director_. You are quite mistaken. Consider:\n\nNot all is good that bears an ancient name,  \nNor need we every modern poem blame:  \nWise men approve the good, or new or old;  \nThe foolish critic follows where he\'s told.\n\n_Assistant_. The responsibility rests with you, sir.\n\n\n\nThere is irony in the fact that the works of the illustrious authors mentioned\nhave perished, that we should hardly know of their existence were it not for\nthe tribute of their modest, youthful rival. But Kalidasa could not read the\nfuture. We can imagine his feelings of mingled pride and fear when his early\nwork was presented at the spring festival before the court of King\nVikramaditya, without doubt the most polished and critical audience that could\nat that hour have been gathered in any city on earth.\n\nThe play which sought the approbation of this audience\n\np. 110\n\nshows no originality of plot, no depth of passion. It is a light, graceful\ndrama of court intrigue. The hero, King Agnimitra, is an historical character\nof the second century before Christ, and Kalidasa\'s play gives us some\ninformation about him that history can seriously consider. The play represents\nAgnimitra\'s father, the founder of the Sunga dynasty, as still living. As the\nseat of empire was in Patna on the Ganges, and as Agnimitra\'s capital is\nVidisha--the modern Bhilsa--it seems that he served as regent of certain\nprovinces during his father\'s lifetime. The war with the King of Vidarbha\nseems to be an historical occurrence, and the fight with the Greek cavalry\nforce is an echo of the struggle with Menander, in which the Hindus were\nultimately victorious. It was natural for Kalidasa to lay the scene of his\nplay in Bhilsa rather than in the far-distant Patna, for it is probable that\nmany in the audience were acquainted with the former city. It is to Bhilsa\nthat the poet refers again in _The Cloud-Messenger_ , where these words are\naddressed to the cloud:\n\n  At thine approach, Dasharna land is blest  \nWith hedgerows where gay buds are all aglow,  \n  With village trees alive with many a nest  \nAbuilding by the old familiar crow,  \nWith lingering swans, with ripe rose-apples\' darker show.\n\n  There shalt thou see the royal city, known  \nAfar, and win the lover\'s fee complete,  \n  If thou subdue thy thunders to a tone  \nOf murmurous gentleness, and taste the sweet,  \nLove-rippling features of the river at thy feet.\n\nYet in Kalidasa\'s day, the glories of the Sunga dynasty were long departed,\nnor can we see why the poet should have chosen his hero and his era as he did.\n\nThere follows an analysis of the plot and some slight criticism.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the stage-director and his assistant, who appear in the\nprologue, the characters of the play are these:\n\np. 111\n\nAGNIMITRA, _king in Vidisha_.  \nGAUTAMA, _a clown, his friend_.  \n_dancing-masters_ :  \n    GANADASA  \n    HARADATTA  \nDHARINI, _the senior queen_.  \nIRAVATI, _the junior queen_.  \nMALAVIKA, _maid to Queen Dharini, later discovered to be a princess_ ,  \nKAUSHIKI, _a Buddhist nun_.  \nBAKULAVALIKA, _a maid, friend of Malavika_.  \nNIPUNIKA, _maid to Queen Iravati_.\n\n_A counsellor, a chamberlain, a humpback, two court poets, maids, and mute\nattendants_.\n\nThe scene is the palace and gardens of King Agnimitra, the time a few days.\n\n\n\nACT I.--After the usual prologue, the maid Bakulavalika appears with another\nmaid. From their conversation we learn that King Agnimitra has seen in the\npalace picture-gallery a new painting of Queen Dharini with her attendants. So\nbeautiful is one of these, Malavika, that the king is smitten with love, but\nis prevented by the jealous queen from viewing the original. At this point the\ndancing-master Ganadasa enters. From him Bakulavalika learns that Malavika is\na wonderfully proficient pupil, while he learns from her that Malavika had\nbeen sent as a present to Queen Dharini by a general commanding a border\nfortress, the queen\'s brother.\n\nAfter this introductory scene, the king enters, and listens to a letter sent\nby the king of Vidarbha. The rival monarch had imprisoned a prince and\nprincess, cousins of Agnimitra, and in response to Agnimitra\'s demand that\nthey be set free, he declares that the princess has escaped, but that the\nprince shall not be liberated except on certain conditions. This letter so\nangers Agnimitra that he despatches an army against the king of Vidarbha.\n\nGautama, the clown, informs Agnimitra that he has devised a plan for bringing\nMalavika into the king\'s presence. He has stirred an envious rivalry in the\nbosoms of the two dancing-masters, who soon appear, each abusing the other\nvigorously, and claiming for himself the pre-eminence in their art. It is\nagreed that each shall exhibit his best pupil\n\np. 112\n\nbefore the king, Queen Dharini, and the learned Buddhist nun, Kaushiki. The\nnun, who is in the secret of the king\'s desire, is made mistress of\nceremonies, and the queen\'s jealous opposition is overborne.\n\n\n\nACT II.--The scene is laid in the concert-hall of the palace. The nun\ndetermines that Ganadasa shall present his pupil first. Malavika is thereupon\nintroduced, dances, and sings a song which pretty plainly indicates her own\nlove for the king. He is in turn quite ravished, finding her far more\nbeautiful even than the picture. The clown manages to detain her some little\ntime by starting a discussion as to her art, and when she is finally permitted\nto depart, both she and the king are deeply in love. The court poet announces\nthe noon hour, and the exhibition of the other dancing-master is postponed.\n\n\n\nACT III.--The scene is laid in the palace garden. From the conversation of two\nmaids it appears that a favourite ashoka-tree is late in blossoming. This kind\nof tree, so the belief runs, can be induced to put forth blossoms if touched\nby the foot of a beautiful woman in splendid garments.\n\nWhen the girls depart, the king enters with the clown, his confidant. The\nclown, after listening to the king\'s lovelorn confidences, reminds him that he\nhas agreed to meet his young Queen Iravati in the garden, and swing with her.\nBut before the queen\'s arrival, Malavika enters, sent thither by Dharini to\ntouch the ashoka-tree with her foot, and thus encourage it to blossom. The\nking and the clown hide in a thicket, to feast their eyes upon her. Presently\nthe maid Bakulavalika appears, to adorn Malavika for the ceremony, and engages\nher in conversation about the king. But now a third pair enter, the young\nQueen Iravati, somewhat flushed with wine, and her maid Nipunika. They also\nconceal themselves to spy upon the young girls. Thus there are three groups\nupon the stage: the two girls believe themselves to be alone; the king and the\nclown are aware of the two girls, as are also the queen and her maid; but\nneither of these two pairs knows of the presence of the other. This situation\ngives rise to very entertaining dialogue, which changes its character when the\nking starts forward\n\np. 113\n\nto express his love for Malavika. Another sudden change is brought about when\nIravati, mad with jealousy, joins the group, sends the two girls away, and\nberates the king. He excuses himself as earnestly as a man may when caught in\nsuch a predicament, but cannot appease the young queen, who leaves him with\nwords of bitter jealousy.\n\n\n\nACT IV.--The clown informs the king that Queen Dharini has locked Malavika and\nher friend in the cellar, and has given orders to the doorkeeper that they are\nto be released only upon presentation of her own signet-ring, engraved with\nthe figure of a serpent. But he declares that he has devised a plan to set\nthem free. He bids the king wait upon Queen Dharini, and presently rushes into\ntheir presence, showing his thumb marked with two scratches, and declaring\nthat he has been bitten by a cobra. Imploring the king to care for his\nchildless mother, he awakens genuine sympathy in the queen, who readily parts\nwith her serpent-ring, supposed to be efficacious in charming away the effects\nof snake-poison. Needless to say, he uses the ring to procure the freedom of\nMalavika and her friend, and then brings about a meeting with Agnimitra in the\nsummer-house. The love-scene which follows is again interrupted by Queen\nIravati. This time the king is saved by the news that his little daughter has\nbeen frightened by a yellow monkey, and will be comforted only by him. The act\nends with the announcement that the ashoka-tree has blossomed.\n\n\n\nACT V.--It now appears that Queen Dharini has relented and is willing to unite\nMalavika with the king; for she invites him to meet her under the ashoka-tree,\nand includes Malavika among her attendants. Word is brought that the army\ndespatched against the king of Vidarbha has been completely successful, and\nthat in the spoil are included two maids with remarkable powers of song. These\nmaids are brought before the company gathered at the tree, where they surprise\nevery one by falling on their faces before Malavika with the exclamation, "Our\nprincess!" Here the Buddhist nun takes up the tale. She tells how her brother,\nthe counsellor of the captive prince, had rescued her and Malavika from the\nking of Vidarbha, and had started for Agnimitra\'s court.\n\np. 114\n\n[paragraph continues] On the way they had been overpowered by robbers, her\nbrother killed, and she herself separated from Malavika. She had thereupon\nbecome a nun and made her way to Agnimitra\'s court, and had there found\nMalavika, who had been taken from the robbers by Agnimitra\'s general and sent\nas a present to Queen Dharini. She had not divulged the matter sooner, because\nof a prophecy that Malavika should be a servant for just one year before\nbecoming a king\'s bride. This recital removes any possible objection to a\nunion of Malavika and Agnimitra. To complete the king\'s happiness, there comes\na letter announcing that his son by Dharini has won a victory over a force of\nGreek cavalry, and inviting the court to be present at the sacrifice which was\nto follow the victory. Thus every one is made happy except the jealous young\nQueen Iravati, now to be supplanted by Malavika; yet even she consents, though\nsomewhat ungraciously, to the arrangements made.\n\nCriticism of the large outlines of this plot would be quite unjust, for it is\ncompletely conventional. In dozens of plays we have the same story: the king\nwho falls in love with a maid-servant, the jealousy of his harem, the eventual\ndiscovery that the maid is of royal birth, and the addition of another wife to\na number already sufficiently large. In writing a play of this kind, the poet\nfrankly accepts the conventions; his ingenuity is shown in the minor\nincidents, in stanzas of poetical description, and in giving abundant\nopportunity for graceful music and dancing. When the play is approached in\nthis way, it is easy to see the _griffe du lion_ in this, the earliest work of\nthe greatest poet who ever sang repeatedly of love between man and woman,\ntroubled for a time but eventually happy. For though there is in Agnimitra, as\nin all heroes of his type, something contemptible, there is in Malavika a\nsweetness, a delicacy, a purity, that make her no unworthy precursor of Sita,\nof Indumati, of the Yaksha\'s bride, and of Shakuntala.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II.--Urvashi](sha14.htm)\n\n'
