Now, indeed, there is this twofold thing, to wit, the eater and\nthat which is eaten 1; and when this pair meets it is called the eater, and\nnot the eaten.\n\n10:6:2:22\\. Now that eater is the same as this Agni (the fire and fire-altar);\nand whatever they assign to him is his assignments; and these assignments\n(ahiti) are mystically called oblations (ahuti), for the gods love the mystic.\n\n10:6:2:33\\. And the eater, doubtless, is the sun, and his assignments\n(offerings) are the moon, for the moon is assigned to the sun 2. Thus much as\nto the deity.\n\n10:6:2:44\\. Now as to the body. The eater, doubtless, is the breath, and its\nassignments are food, for the food is consigned to (the channel of) the\nbreath. Thus much as to Agni.\n\n10:6:2:55\\. Now as to the Arka (flame). The Arka, doubtless, is Agni; and his\njoy are the oblations, for the oblations are a joy 3 to Agni.\n\np. 399\n\n10:6:2:66\\. And the Arka, doubtless, is the sun; and his joy is the moon, for\nthe moon is a joy to the sun. Thus much as to the deity.\n\n10:6:2:77\\. Now as to the body. The Arka, doubtless, is the breath, and his\njoy is food, for food is a joy to (the channel of) the breath. Thus much as to\nthe Arka.\n\n10:6:2:88\\. Now as to the Uktha (song of praise). The 'uk,' doubtless, is\nAgni, and his 'tham' is oblations, for by oblations Agni rises (ut-tha, i. e.\nblazes up).\n\n10:6:2:99\\. And the 'uk,' doubtless, is the sun, and his 'tham' is the moon,\nfor by the moon the sun rises. Thus much as to the deity.\n\n10:6:2:1010\\. Now as to the body. The 'uk,' doubtless, is the breath, and the\n'tham' is food, for by food the breath rises (increases). Thus much as to the\nUktha. That Agni-like, Arka-like, Uktha-like one is the same as the Purusha;\nand, verily, the enemy withers away of whosoever, knowing this, thus serves\nthat Agni-like, Arka-like, Uktha-like Purusha.\n\n10:6:2:1111\\. The fire, indeed, is kindled by the breath, the wind by the\nfire, the sun by the wind, the moon by the sun, the stars by the moon, and the\nlightning by the stars 1:--so great, indeed, is the kindling both in this and\nin yonder world; and, verily, whosoever knows this is enkindled to that full\nextent both in this and in yonder world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[398:1](sbe4372.htm#fr_820) Or, as Saya _n_ a takes it,--this (world) is\ntwofold, the eater and the eaten.\n\n[398:2](sbe4372.htm#fr_821) The moon here would seem to be considered as\nserving for food to the sun, as it does to the gods. The commentary is not\nvery explicit on this point,--tas _k_ yahutaya _s_ (!) _k_ andrama _h_ _k_\nandramasa _m_ hy aditya adadhatity anena _k_ andramasa aditye adhanad\nadhititva _m_ pratipaditam.\n\n[398:3](sbe4372.htm#fr_822) 'Kam' is used adverbially 'well,'--they do him\ngood, they please him.\n\n[399:1](sbe4372.htm#fr_823) Agnir pra _n_ ena dipyate, pra _n_ avayor abhave\nalpatve agner dipana _m_ nasti; agnina vayur dipyate vayunadityo\xe0\xa4\xbdvash _t_\nambhamatre _n_ a tad dipanam; adityena _k_ andrama _h_ prabha _m_ _s_ o _g_\nyoti _h_ _s_ astrasiddha _h_ ; ratrau nakshatra _n_ i _k_ andramasa praka _s_\nante diva hi mahattare _n_ a suryapraka _s_ ena tirobhutatvan na tada praka\n_s_ a _h_ ; nakshatrair vidyut praka _s_ yate.
