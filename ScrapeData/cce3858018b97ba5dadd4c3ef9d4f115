Now indeed (that) happens (also which the following verses teach):\n\n2\\. 'Let him sprinkle that food with the remainder of the burnt oblations. But\nwhat is given without (touching it with) the thumb does not gladden the\nmanes.' 2\n\n3\\. 'The malevolent Asuras seek an opportunity (to snatch away) that food\nintended for the manes, which is not supported with both hands.' 3\n\n4\\. 'The Yatudhanas and Pi _s_ a _k_ as, who receive no share, steal the food\nif sesamum grains are not scattered (on the seats of the guests), and the\nAsuras (take it) if (the host) is under the sway of anger.' 4\n\n5\\. 'If a person dressed in reddish clothes mutters prayers, offers burnt\noblations, or receives gifts, the sacrificial viands, offered at sacrifices to\nthe gods or to the manes, do not reach the deities.' 5\n\np. 270\n\n6\\. 'If gifts are given or received without (touching them with) the thumb\nand, if one sips water standing, (the performer of the act) is not benefited\nthereby.'\n\n7\\. At the beginning and at the end (of a _S_ raddha) water must be giver. (to\nthe guests). 7\n\n8\\. In every case the muttering (of sacred texts) and the other (necessary\nacts must be performed) according to the rule.\n\n9\\. The remaining (rules) have been prescribed (in the section) on the burnt\noblations on Ash _t_ aka (days). 9\n\n10\\. 'He shall feed two (Brahma _n_ as) at the offering to the gods and three\nat the offering to the manes, or a single man on either occasion. Even a very\nwealthy man shall not be anxious (to entertain) a large company.' 10\n\n11\\. 'A large company destroys these five (advantages), the respectful\ntreatment (of the invited guests, the propriety of) time and place, purity and\n(the selection of) virtuous Brahma _n_ a (guests); therefore he shall not\ninvite (a large number).'\n\n12\\. 'In front (feed) the fathers of the (sacrificer), to the left the\ngrandfathers, to the right the great-grandfathers, and at the back those who\npare off (portions) from the cakes.' 12\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[269:2](sbe1469.htm#fr_1281) **15**. Manu III, 215. See also above, II, 8, 14,\n10.\n\n[269:3](sbe1469.htm#fr_1282) Vasish _th_ a XI, 25.\n\n[269:4](sbe1469.htm#fr_1283) Vish _n_ u LXXIII, x a; Manu III, 229.\n\n[269:5](sbe1469.htm#fr_1284) Govinda states that the rule is intended to teach\nthat the sacrificer and the guests at a _S_ raddha must be dressed in white,\np. 270 and that ascetics are not to be invited. But see Vasish _th_ a XI, 17,\n34.\n\n[270:7](sbe1469.htm#fr_1285) Vish _n_ u LXXIII, 12, 27, and above, II, 8, 14,\n6.\n\n[270:9](sbe1469.htm#fr_1286) Baudhayana G _ri_ hya-sutra II, 17, 18.\n\n[270:10](sbe1469.htm#fr_1287)-11. Vasish _th_ a XI, 27-28.\n\n[270:12](sbe1469.htm#fr_1288) In the beginning of the verse I read with M. and\nthe I. O. copy of the commentary urasta _h_ pitaras tasya, and in the end with\nthe Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS. pi _n_ _d_ atakshaka _h_. M. reads pi _n_ _d_\natarkya, and the copies of the commentary pi _n_ _d_ odaka _h_. Both these p.\n271 readings are clearly corrupt, and so is the var. lect. of the G _ri_ hya-\nsa _m_ graha, quoted in the Petersburg Dictionary, pi _n_ _d_ atarkuka _h_. Pi\n_n_ _d_ atakshaka _h_ , 'the cutters or parers of the cakes,' is appropriate,\nbecause the remoter ancestors, who, as Govinda too declares, are meant by the\nterm, obtain the fragments of the funeral cakes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Adhyaya 9, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 16](sbe1470.htm)\n\n"
