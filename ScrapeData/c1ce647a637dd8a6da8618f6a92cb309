Therefore the next paragraphs have been added.\n\n[63:3](sbe15042.htm#fr_233) The construction of these two sentences is not\nclear to me.\n\n[63:4](sbe15042.htm#fr_234) Here follows the Anukrama _n_ i, and in some MSS.\nthe same invocation with which the next Valli begins.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1](sbe15043.htm)\n\n"
