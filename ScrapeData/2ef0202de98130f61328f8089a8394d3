Within the sight of his (teacher or teacher\'s relations) he shall do none\nof those (actions, as putting on a garland), nor cause them to be done.\n\n4\\. Nor (shall he wear garlands &c. whilst performing) acts for his pleasure,\n\n5\\. As, for instance, cleaning his teeth, shampooing, combing the hair, and\nthe like.\n\n6\\. And the teacher shall not speak of the goods of the (pupil) with the\nintention to obtain them. 6\n\n7\\. But some declare, that, if a pupil who has bathed (after completing his\nstudies) is called by his teacher or has gone to see him, he shall not take\noff 7\n\np. 30\n\nthat (garland or other ornaments) which he wears according to the law at the\ntime (of that ceremony).\n\n8\\. He shall not sit on a seat higher (than that of his teacher),\n\n9\\. Nor on a seat that has more legs (than that of his teacher),\n\n10\\. Nor on a seat that stands more firmly fixed (on the ground than that of\nhis teacher), 10\n\n11\\. Nor shall he sit or lie on a couch or seat which is used (by his\nteacher). 11\n\n12\\. If he is ordered (by his teacher), he shall on journey ascend a carriage\nafter him. 12\n\n13\\. (At his teacher\'s command) he shall also enter an assembly, ascend a\nroller (which his teacher drags along), sit on a mat of fragrant grass or a\ncouch of straw (together with his teacher). 13\n\n14\\.

In time of need he may attract attention (by any of these acts).\n\n17\\. If (a pupil) resides (in the same village) with (his teacher after the\ncompletion of his studies), he shall go to see him every morning and evening,\nwithout being called. 17\n\n18\\. And if he returns from a journey, he shall (go to) see him on the same\nday.\n\n19\\. If his teacher and his teacher\'s teacher meet, he shall embrace the feet\nof his teacher\'s teacher, and then show his desire to do the same to his\nteacher.\n\n20\\.

And (if he does not live in the same village), he shall go frequently to\nhis teacher\'s residence, in order to see him, and bring him some (present)\nwith his own hand, be it even only a stick for cleaning the teeth. Thus (the\nduties of a student have been explained).\n\n23\\. (Now) the conduct of a teacher towards his pupil (will be explained).\n\n24\\. Loving him like his own son, and full of attention, he shall teach him\nthe sacred science, without hiding anything in the whole law. 24\n\n25\\. And he shall not use. him for his own purposes to the detriment of his\nstudies except in times of distress.\n\np. 32\n\n26\\. That pupil who, attending to two (teachers), accuses his (principal and\nfirst) teacher of ignorance, remains no (longer) a pupil.\n\n27\\. A teacher also, who neglects the instruction (of his pupil), does no\n(longer) remain a teacher. 26\n\n28\\. If the (pupil) commits faults, (the teacher) shall always reprove him.\n\n29\\. Frightening, fasting, bathing in (cold) water, and banishment from the\nteacher\'s presence are the punishments (which are to be employed), according\nto the greatness (of the fault), until (the pupil) leaves off (sinning). 29\n\n30\\.

Haradatta does not connect this Sutra with\nthe preceding one. He explains it by itself: \'(We will now declare) how a\nstudent (who has left his teacher, but is not married) ought to behave.\'\n\n[29:6](sbe0211.htm#fr_234) \'If the teacher comes to the house of his (former)\npupil (who has become a householder), he shall, for instance, not say, "Oh,\nwhat a beautiful dish!" in such a manner, that his desire to obtain it becomes\napparent.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[29:7](sbe0211.htm#fr_235) This opinion is contrary to \xc3\x82pastamba\'s view given\nin Sutras 2 and 3 above.\n\n[30:10](sbe0211.htm#fr_236) \'When he gives to his teacher a wooden seat (with\nlegs), he shall not sit on a cane-seat (without legs), for the latter touches\nthe ground on all sides.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[30:11](sbe0211.htm#fr_237) Manu II, 119.\n\n[30:12](sbe0211.htm#fr_238) This rule is an exception to I, 2, 7, 5. Manu II,\n204.\n\n[30:13](sbe0211.htm#fr_239) \'The roller is an implement used by husbandmen,\nwith which the ploughed land is made even. If one person ascends it and\nanother drags it along, the ground becomes even. If that is dragged by the\nteacher, the pupil shall ascend it at his command. He shall not disobey from\nfear of the unseemliness of the action.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[30:15](sbe0211.htm#fr_240) Manu II, 199; regarding the term Guru, see above,\nI, 2, 6, 29.\n\n[31:17](sbe0211.htm#fr_241) This and the following Sutras refer to a person\nwho has finished his studentship, while the preceding ones, from Sutra 8,\napply to the time of studentship also.\n\n[31:24](sbe0211.htm#fr_242) Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 126.\n\n[32:26](sbe0211.htm#fr_243) \'Another commentator says, "That pupil who offends\nhis teacher in word, thought, or deed, and directs his mind improperly, i.e.\ndoes not properly obey, does not (any longer) remain a pupil."\'--Haradatta.\n\n[32:29](sbe0211.htm#fr_244) But see also Manu. VIII, 299, where corporal\npunishment is permitted.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 3, Kha _n_ _d_ a 9](sbe0212.htm)\n\n'
