There is option with regard to what precedes (i.e. the altar made of\nbricks) on account of subject-matter, and hence there is action; as in the\ncase of the manasa cup.\n\nIn the Va _g_ asaneyaka, in the Agnirahasya chapter, there are references to\ncertain altars built of mind, 'built of mind, built of speech,' &c. The doubt\nhere arises whether those structures of mind, and so on, which metaphorically\nare called fire-altars, should be considered as being of the nature of action,\non account of their connexion with a performance which itself is of the nature\nof action; or merely of the nature of meditation, as being connected with an\nactivity of the nature of meditation. The Sutra maintains the former view.\nSince those things 'built of mind, and so on,' are, through being _built_ (or\n_piled up_ ), constituted as fire-altars, they demand a performance with which\nto connect themselves; and as in immediate proximity to them no performance is\nenjoined, and as the general subject-matter of the section is the fire-altar\nbuilt of bricks--introduced by means of the clause 'Non-being this was in the\nbeginning'---which is invariably connected with a performance of the nature of\noutward action, viz. a certain sacrificial performance--we conclude that the\naltars built of mind, &c., which the text mentions in connexion with the same\nsubject-matter, are themselves of the nature of action, and as such can be\nused as alternatives for the altar built of bricks. 1. An analogous case is\npresented by the so-called _mental_ cup. On the tenth, so-called avivakya, day\nof the Soma sacrifice extending over twelve days,\n\np. 669\n\nthere takes place the mental offering of a Soma cup, all the rites connected\nwith which are rehearsed in imagination only; the offering of that cup is thus\nreally of the nature of thought only, but as it forms an auxiliary element in\nan actual outward sacrificial performance it itself assumes the character of\nan action.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[668:1](sbe48428.htm#fr_42) So that for the actual outward construction of a\nbrick altar there may optionally be substituted the merely mental construction\nof an imaginary altar.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 45.
