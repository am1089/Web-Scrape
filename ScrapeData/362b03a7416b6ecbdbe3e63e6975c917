Left an\norphan at an early age, Appar was brought up by a loving elder sister as a\npious devotee of S\xcc\x81iva. Great was the sister\'s grief when Appar forsook the\nfaith of his fathers and became a religious teacher among the Janis. But her\nearnest prayers at last prevailed, and Appar not only came back to S\xcc\x81aivism\nhimself, but was the means of reconverting to S\xcc\x81aivism the king of his\ncountry. His full name was Tirun\xc4\x81vukkarasu, or \'King of the Tongue\', but his\nyoung friend Sambandar called him App\xc4\x81r, or Father, and the name stuck to him.\nHe too wandered throughout the Tamil country, sometimes alone, sometimes in\ncompany with Sambandar, singing his way from shrine to shrine. Pictures show\nhim holding in his hand a little tool for scraping grass, with which he used\nto scrape the stones of the temple courts. The Jains persecuted him, and many\nstories tell of his miraculous escapes from their hands.\n\np. 37\n\nHis hymns show a truly religious nature, with a deep-rooted sense of sin and\nneed, and an exalted joy in God. There is real critical acumen in the old\nepigram which represents S\xcc\x81iva as appraising the three great writers of the\nD\xc4\x93v\xc4\x81ram, or S\xcc\x81aivite hymn-book: "Sambandar praised himself; Sundarar praised\nMe for pelf; My Appar praised Me Myself."\n\np. 38 p. 39\n\nGod, the essentially unsearchable, in His grace will reveal Himself to men.\n(See the first of the legends told in the Introduction.) Athihai Vira\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81nam,\nin the South Arcot District, is the shrine here commemorated.\n\n25\\. Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, spouse of Lakshmi, and four-ways-facing Brahm,  \n   Searched the heights and depths, but Thy feet could never sec.  \nYet, O only Lord, who in Athihai dost dwell,  \n   Formless, in Thy grace, grant the sight of them to me.\n\n* * *\n\nThe notable thing about our next verse is not so much the legend of the\ncrushing of R\xc4\x81va\xe1\xb9\x87a, who tried to storm the mountain Kail\xc4\x81sa, where S\xcc\x81iva had\nHis heaven, but rather the thought of the devotee being stamped as the\nproperty of his god, a thought which recurs in other hymns. According to\ntradition Apparswami did receive the Hindu equivalent of St. Francis\'\nstigmata, the mark of S\xcc\x81iva\'s bull as if branded on his body. We cannot help\nrecalling St. Paul\'s expression in Galatians vi. 17.\n\n26\\. All other worlds his sceptre swayed,  \n  But when Kail\xc4\x81sa he would rule  \nThy crushing foot presumption paid.  \n  O stamp me with. Thy sacred bull,  \nWhite as Him\xc4\x81l\'ya\'s snowy hill.  \n  Accent me, O our truth divine,  \nThere where the moon outsoareth still  \n  Groves of T\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\x85g\xc4\x81naim\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dam\'s shrine.\n\np. 40 p. 41\n\nHere is the divine vision as the enraptured S\xcc\x81aivite sees it.\n\n27\\. See, there His bright trident appears to me;  \n  See, there is the moon in His tangled hair;  \nHis garland of flowers from the kondai tree,  \n  And the ear-ring white in His either ear,  \nThe cloak that He tore from the elephant wild,  \n  His glittering crown and His body\'s sheen.  \nAsh-smeared, He is ever the undefiled,  \n  In P\xc5\xabva\xe1\xb9\x87am circled by groves all green.\n\n* * *\n\nThe singer, standing at the shrine of Tiruvalur (\xc4\x80r\xc5\xabr) in the Tanjore\ndistrict, muses over the ancient connection of his lord with the holy place,\nsuggesting that it began before the creation, before S\xcc\x81iva wrought his\ngreatest marvels, perhaps even before the one Supreme, \xc4\xaas\xcc\x81vara, expanded into\nthe triad Brahm\xc4\x81, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u and Rudra.\n\n28\\. When was that ancient day our Lord  \n  Chose \xc4\x80r\xc5\xabr should His temple be?  \nWas\'t when He stood \'mid praising worlds  \n  Alone, or when the One grew three?  \nWas\'t when in wrath He burned up Death,  \n  Or turned on Lust His flaming eye?  \nOr when creative, immanent,  \n  He called to being earth and sky?  \nWas\'t when, his young deer in his hand,  \n  He came, with Um\xc4\x81 as His part?  \nOr ere He joined that lady fair  \n  Took He our \xc4\x80r\xc5\xabr to His heart?\n\np. 42 p. 43\n\nIt is often said, not without truth, that Hinduism fails to create a strong\nsense of sin. But there are great exceptions: witness the following verses,\nsamples of many, taken from a hymn which trembles with feeling. The author is\nsunk in sin. Or he has been like a swing, flying first toward evil and then\ntowards God; but now, joy! the cord has snapped, and he lies fixed at his\nLord\'s feet. Yet the old mood returns; his soul is bound and drugged with\nsleep, and life has no joys to offer unless God will save.\n\n##### The Soul\'s Bitter Cry\n\n29\\. In right I have no power to live,  \n  Day after day I\'m stained with sin;  \nI read, but do not understand;  \n  I hold Thee not my heart within.  \nO light, O flame, O first of all,  \n  I wandered far that I might see,  \nAthihai V\xc4\xabra\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81nam\'s Lord,  \n  Thy flower-like feet of purity.\n\n30\\. Daily I\'m sunk in worldly sin;  \n  Naught know I as I ought to know;  \nAbsorbed in vice as \'twere my kin,  \n  I see no path in which to go.  \nO Thou with throat one darkling gem,  \n  Gracious, such grace to me accord,  \nThat I may see Thy beauteous feet,  \n  Athihai V\xc4\xabra\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81nam\'s Lord.\n\n31\\. My fickle heart one love forsakes,  \n  And forthwith to some other clings;  \nSwiftly to some one thing it sways,  \n  And e\'en as swiftly backward swings.  \nO Thou with crescent in Thy hair,  \n  Athihai V\xc4\xabra\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81nam\'s Lord,  \nFixed at Thy feet henceforth I lie,  \n  For Thou hast broken my soul\'s cord.\n\np. 44 p. 45\n\n32\\. The bond of lust I cannot break;  \n  Desire\'s fierce torture will not die;  \nMy soul I cannot stab awake  \n  To scan my flesh with seeing eye.  \nI bear upon me load of deeds,  \n  Load such as I can ne\'er lay down.  \nAthihai V\xc4\xabra\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81nam\'s Lord,  \n  Weary of joyless life I\'ve grown.\n\n* * *\n\nFresh pictures in another hymn set forth his sad condition. God\'s vessels are\nfull of the sweetness of grace, but his spoon has no handle. He feels himself\nin the deadly grasp of fate, like the frog in the cruel mouth of the snake\nwhich is slowly swallowing it down. Or he is on a raft on the sea of life,\nwrecked on the rock of lust.\n\n33\\. While violence is in my heart,  \n  Care of my body cage is vain.  \nMy spoon no handle hath when I  \n  Thy honey\'s grace to drink am fain.  \nAs in the serpent\'s mouth the frog,  \n  Caught in life\'s terrors, wild I rave.  \nThou, King of holy Ottiy\xc5\xabr,  \n  Wilt Thou not care for me and save?\n\n34\\. When on life\'s angry waves I launch,  \n  My heart\'s the raft I take to me,  \nMy mind\'s the pole I lean upon,  \n  Vexation\'s freight I bear to sea.  \nI strike upon the rock of lust!  \n  O then, though witless quite I he,  \nGrant, King of holy Ottiy\xc5\xabr,  \n  Such wisdom that I think of Thee.\n\np. 46 p. 47\n\nIt would be hard to find a more comprehensive confession of sin than our next\nstanza from another hymn.\n\n35\\. Evil, all evil, my race, evil my qualities all,  \nGreat am I only in sin, evil is even my good.  \nEvil my innermost self, foolish, avoiding the pure,  \nBeast am I not, yet the ways of the beast I can never forsake.  \nI can exhort with strong words, telling men what they should hate,  \nYet can I never give gifts, only to beg them I know.  \nAh! wretched man that I am, whereunto came I to birth?\n\n* * *\n\nWe give next a series of stanzas in various metres from different hymns, in\nwhich the saint utters in song some of the joy which his religion has brought\nhim. God has revealed mysteries to him which tongue cannot tell, and dwells in\nhis life\'s innermost places. God is to him the fabled katpaha tree, supplying\nhis every need. God is his all in all, and His presence is sweeter than melody\nor evening moonlight.\n\n36\\. The moving water He made stand unmoving in His hair;  \n  And He my thoughtless heart hath fixed it thought of Him alone:  \nHe taught me that which none can learn, what none can see laid bare;  \n  What tongue tells not He told; me He pursuer and made His own.  \n    The spotless pure, the holy One, my fell disease He healed,  \n    And in P\xc5\xabnturutti to me e\'en me, Himself revealed.\n\np. 48 p. 49\n\n37\\. O wealth, my treasure, sweetness, lustre fair of heavenly hosts,  \n  Of lustre glory that excels, embodied One, my kin,  \nMy flesh, yea heart within my flesh, image within my heart,  \n  My all-bestowing tree, my eye, pupil my eye within,  \nPicture seen in that pupil, lord of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb8\x8dutu\xe1\xb9\x9bai cool,  \n  Immortals\' king, keep far from me strong pain of fruits of sin.\n\n38\\. Thou to me art parents, Lord,  \n  Thou all kinsmen that I need,  \nThou to me art loved ones fair,  \n  Thou art treasure rich indeed.  \nFamily, friends, home art Thou,  \n  Life and joy I draw from Thee,  \nFalse world\'s good by Thee I leave,  \n  Gold, pearl, wealth art Thou to me.\n\n39\\. As the v\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\x87a\'s pure sound, as the moonlight at even,  \n  As the south wind\'s soft breath, as the spring\'s growing heat,  \nAs the pool hovered over by whispering bees,  \n  So sweet is the shade at our Father-Lord\'s feet.\n\np. 50 p. 51\n\n40\\. No man holds sway o\'er us,  \n  Nor death nor hell fear we;  \nNo tremblings, griefs of mind,  \n  No pains nor cringings see.  \nJoy, day by day, unchanged  \n  Is ours, for we are His,  \nHis ever, who doth reign,  \n  Our S\xcc\x81a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, in bliss.  \nHere to His feet we\'ve come,  \n  Feet as plucked flow\'re\'ts fair;  \nSee how His ears divine  \n  Ring and white couch-shell wear.\n\n41\\. Though they give me the jewels from Indra\'s abode,  \n  Though they grant me dominion o\'er earth, yea o\'er heaven,  \nIf they be not the friends of our lord Mah\xc4\x81d\xc4\x93v,  \n  What care I for wealth by such ruined hands giv\'n?  \nBut if they love S\xcc\x81iva, who hides in His hair  \n  The river of Ga\xe1\xb9\x85ga, then whoe\'er they be,  \nFoul lepers, or outcastes, yea slayers of kine,  \n  To them is my homage, gods are they to me.\n\n* * *\n\nOften the Hindu devotee asks and re-asks the fundamental question \'Who am I?\',\ncoming to the saddest of conclusions, but setting against the background of\nhis delusive life of self the great reality of God, to worship whom is to find\nrelease from the prison-house of personality.\n\np. 52 p. 53\n\n42\\. Thy father, mother, brethren, wife,  \n  Ask thyself who are they?  \nThy children; yea, thy very self,  \n  Who art thou, canst thou say?  \nHow cam\'st thou here, how wilt depart?  \n  Love not this world unreal.  \nYe anxious souls, this lesson learn,  \n  To one pure name appeal.  \nOur father He, crowned with the moon  \n  And snake. Who Him adore,  \nProne lying, with \'\'Hail S\xcc\x81iva, hail,\'\'  \n  In heav\'n live evermore.\n\nOur next hymn with the short-lined verses (nos. 43 to 48) is a kind of\nS\xcc\x81aivite consecration hymn, mentioning successively various parts of the body\n--head, eyes, cars--to be given to the worship of S\xcc\x81iva. Verse 46 must sound\nsadly to a S\xcc\x81aivite, for it is frequently sung in the ears of the dying, as a\nplaintive appeal to think of God. Verse 47 rises far above the usual ideas of\nfuture absorption to the thought of a blissful state of communion with and\npraise of God.\n\n43\\. Head of mine, bow to Him,  \n  True Head, skull garlanded,  \nA skull was His strange begging-bowl,  \n  Bow low to Him, my head.\n\n44\\. Eyes of mine, gaze on Him  \n  Who drank the dark sea\'s bane.  \nEight arms He brandishes in dance,  \n  At Him agaze remain.\n\np. 54 p. 55\n\n45\\. Ears of mine, hear His praise,  \n  S\xcc\x81iva, our flaming king.  \nFlaming as coral red His form:  \n  Ears, hear men praises sing.\n\n46\\. What kinsmen in that hour  \n  When life departs, have we?  \nWho but Ku\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81lam\'s dancing lord  \n  Can then our kinsman be?\n\n47\\. How proud shall I be there,  \n  One of His heavenly host,  \nAt His fair feet who holds the deer,  \n  How proud will he my boast!\n\n48\\. I sought Him and I found.  \n  Brahm sought in vain on high.  \nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u delved vainly underground.  \n  Him in my soul found I.\n\nThe mystic can never be a satisfied ceremonialist. These S\xcc\x81aivite devotees\ncommonly praise the god of a particular shrine in language which might suggest\nthat S\xcc\x81iva is only to be found there. And everyone who knows India remembers\nthe ceaseless streams of pilgrims journeying to the Ganges or the Cauvery\n(Tamil K\xc4\x81viri), to R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x93s\xcc\x81waram or Cape Comorin or a hundred other holy places.\nBut with a fine inconsistency these ancient singers sometimes point men away\nfrom externalities to a worship inward and spiritual; witness the following\nhymn. As to the terms used, in v. 50, Vedas are the religious works of the\nhighest authority, S\xcc\x81\xc4\x81stras are philosophical and practical works based on\nthem, while V\xc4\x93d\xc4\x81ngas are sciences subordinate to the Vedas, and there are six\nof them.\n\np. 56 p. 57\n\n49\\. Why bathe in Ga\xe1\xb9\x85ga\'s stream, or K\xc4\x81viri?  \n    Why go to Comorin in Ko\xe1\xb9\x85gu\'s land?  \nWhy seek the waters of the sounding sea?  \n  Release is theirs, and theirs alone, who call  \n  In every place upon the Lord of all.\n\n50\\. Why chant the Vedas, hear the S\xcc\x81\xc4\x81stras\' lore?  \n    Why daily teach the books of righteousness?  \nWhy the V\xc4\x93d\xc4\x81ngas six say o\'er and o\'er?  \n  Release is theirs, and theirs alone, whose heart  \n  From thinking of its Lord shall ne\'er depart.\n\n51\\. Why roam the jungle, wander cities through?  \n    Why plague life with unstinting; penance hard?  \nWhy eat no flesh, and gaze into the blue?  \n  Release is theirs, and theirs alone,  \n  Who cry Unceasing to the Lord of wisdom high.\n\n52\\. Why fast and starve, why suffer pains austere?  \n    Why climb the mountains, doing penance harsh?  \nWhy go to bathe in waters far and near?  \n  Release is theirs, and theirs alone, who call  \n  At every time upon the Lord of all.\n\n* * *\n\nIt looks like a sudden drop when the same writer in our next hymn seems to say\nthat everything depends upon the pronunciation of the five sacred syllables\nwhich can be translated \'Hail, S\xcc\x81iva!\' In the later development of S\xcc\x81aivism\nthe pronunciation of these syllables was exalted into a primary religious\nduty. But in the creative period in which these hymns were written the name\nprobably stood for the person, so that we have here a religious \'calling upon\nthe name of\n\np. 58 p. 59\n\nthe Lord\' in the devotion of worship. In the first stanza there is a\nremarkable use of the term \'Word.\' Modern S\xcc\x81aivites identify this \'Word\' with\nUm\xc4\x81, S\xcc\x81iva\'s consort. We can compare the Sanskrit V\xc4\x81k (Word) in the \xe1\xb9\x9aig V\xc4\x93da.\n\nThe last lines of verse 53 are connected in the minds of S\xcc\x81aivites with a\nstory that Apparsw\xc4\x81mi was actually sunk in the sea by Jain persecutors, with\ntwo great stones tied to him, but on crying \'Hail, S\xcc\x81iva! he floated to the\nsurface.\n\nThe five products of the cow referred to in verse 54 are all used together in\nceremonial purification--milk, curds, ghee, urine, and dung.\n\n53\\. O Lord of Scripture, whom the Word doth help,  \nCelestial light of heaven, so I but praise,  \nWith hands meetly upraised, Thy golden feet,  \nThen though men tie on me two weighty stones,  \nAnd sink me in the ocean\'s depth, e\'en then  \nThe cry \'Hail, S\xcc\x81iva,\' would salvation be.\n\n54\\. The lotus is the glory of all flowers;  \nThe glory of all kine is Hara\'s use  \nOf that which they put forth. Glory of kings  \nIs the unswerving straightness of their deeds.  \nBut if we ask the glory of the tongue,  \n\'Tis to cry out aloud, \'Hail, S\xcc\x81iva, hail.\'\n\n55\\. For men who all renounce, \'tis glory true  \nTo wear the sacred ash. For Br\xc4\x81hmans pure  \nThe V\xc4\x93das and V\xc4\x93d\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85gas are their pride.  \nThe white moon\'s glory is to shine serene  \nOn the long locks of S\xcc\x81iva, while for _us_  \nTrue glory is to cry \'Hail, S\xcc\x81iva, hail.\'\n\np. 60 p. 61\n\nTradition connects our next stanza with a story of Apparsw\xc4\x81mi being smitten\nwith an inward disease when he forsook S\xcc\x81aivism and became a Jain. The pain\nproved, says the legend, a convincing argument which reconverted him,\nwhereupon he was promptly cured. But internal evidence proves this hymn to\nhave been composed long after his return to S\xcc\x81aivism. Nandi is the name of\nS\xcc\x81iva\'s bull.\n\n56\\. Thou takest not my deadly pain away,  \n  My torments, Nandi-rider, never cease;  \nAt Thy feet would I worship night and day,  \n  But since my bowels writhe, and ne\'er find peace,  \n    I can no more! O Sire, to Thee I cry,  \n    Who dwell\'st by Ke\xe1\xb8\x8dila, in Athihai.\n\n* * *\n\nNature sometimes spoke to our author of God. The union of sexes even in\nanimals one day spoke to him as a revelation of divine things.\n\n57\\. I\'ll follow those who going to the shrine their praises sound,  \n  With blooms and water for the god who wears the moon so mild  \nAll lovely in His locks, a garland wreathed His neck around,  \n  And with Him sing they P\xc4\x81rvati, the mountain god\'s fair child.  \n    Once as I went to Aiy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x9bu, with light and reverent tread,  \n    I saw come two young elephants, male by loved female led,  \n    And in that sight I saw God\'s foot, saw secret things unsaid.\n\np. 62 p. 63\n\nGod is the great yogi, the wielder of mystic powers.\n\n58\\. "O greatly loved, our King, our Lord, from all eternity,  \n  Our portion, our true mystic," thus from day to day I sing.  \nO golden one, O hill of coral, I in love of Thee  \n  Have wandered far and wide, Athihai V\xc4\xabra\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadanam\'s king,  \nHave wandered far the shining blossom of Thy foot to see.\n\n* * *\n\nOne whole hymn, from which our next verse is taken, is a prayer for the\nopening of a door. Tradition has it that the great locked temple door at\nVed\xc4\x81ranyam swung open in answer to this song.\n\n59\\. Um\xc4\x81 is Thy portion, whose words are like song.  \n  In fair Ma\xe1\xb9\x9baikk\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8du men circle round Thee  \nIn worship. O graciously open this door  \n  That we Thy true servants Thy glory may see.\n\n* * *\n\nHere is a very popular stanza. There used to be a beggar in Madras who recited\nit, and it alone, all day long.\n\np. 64 p. 65\n\n60\\. He is ever hard to find, but He lives in the thought of the good;  \nHe is the innermost secret of Scripture, inscrutable, unknowable;  \nHe is honey and milk and the shining light. He is the king of the Devas,  \nImmanent in Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, in Brahm\xc4\x81, in flame and in wind,  \nYea in the mighty sounding sea and in the mountains.  \nHe is the great One who chooses Perumpattapuliy\xc5\xabr for His own.  \nIf there be days when my tongue. is dumb and speaks not of Him,  \nLet no such days be counted in the record of my life.\n\n* * *\n\nWhatever karma may teach of the inevitable consequence of evil, devotees hold\nthat they may count on receiving divine forgiveness, for which the gracious\nnature of God is a sufficient pledge and guarantee.\n\n61\\. Thy throat the black sea\'s poison drank, as \'twere ambrosia sweet,  \n  O deer-skin wearer, Um\xc4\x81\'s lord, king of the gods on high;  \n  Kail\xc4\x81sa\'s hill is Thine abode, and when Thy lovers cry  \n"Forgive our sin," great One, forgiveness is Thy duty meet;  \n    For with Thee is great grace, lord of celestial beings all,  \n    Who dwell\'st in \xc4\x80va\xe1\xb8\x8dutu\xe1\xb9\x9bai, where peacocks dance and call.\n\np. 66 p. 67\n\nThe dreadful fate in store for irreligious men that is of being slowly killed\nby sore sickness, then being born again to a joyless life that circles round\nonce more to death in unending cycles of dreariness.\n\nThe \'letters five\' in no. 63 refer to the five-syllabled phrase na-mah-S\xcc\x81i-v\xc4\x81-\nya, whose praise is chanted in vv. 53-55.\n\n62\\. The ill-starred town without a house of God,  \n  Wherein white ash on no man\'s brow doth glow,  \nThe town where pious praises are unsung,  \n  Where are no wayside shrines men\'s faith to show,  \nWhere none blow joyfully the conch-shell white,  \n  Where spread no canopies, no flags appear,  \nWhere none make flowery offerings ere they eat,  \n  Call it no town, \'tis but a jungle drear.\n\n63\\. If men speak not His name in letters five,  \n  Nor e\'er the fire-formed S\xcc\x81iva\'s praise repeat,  \nAnd never walk in reverence round His shrine,  \n  And pluck no flowers for offering ere they eat,  \nIf they for healing wear no sacred ash,  \n  I\'ll tell you whereunto such men were born,  \n\'Twas that foul plagues might torture them to death,  \n  Then death bring rebirths endlessly forlorn.\n\n* * *\n\nOur last fragment from Apparsw\xc4\x81mi is in the minor key, in which so many of his\nrefrains are pitched. It seems to prove, contrary to tradition, that Appar was\nonce a married man.\n\n64\\. Immersed in painful cherishing  \n  Of child and wedded wife,  \nNo room is there in me to feel  \n  Thy power, Lord of my life.  \nO whereunto came I to birth?  \n  To cherish this false world?  \nOr watch it, bubble-like, appear,  \n  Then be to nothing hurled?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sundaram\xc5\xabrti Sw\xc4\x81mi and his Hymns](htss05.htm)\n\n'
