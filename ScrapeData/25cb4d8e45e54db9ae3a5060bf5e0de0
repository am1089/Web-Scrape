The non-difference (of the world) from that (viz. Brahman) follows from\nwhat begins with the word arambhana.\n\nUnder II, 1, 7 and other Sutras the non-difference of the effect, i.e. the\nworld from the cause, i.e. Brahman was assumed, and it was on this basis that\nthe proof of Brahman being the cause of the world proceeded. The present Sutra\nnow raises a prima facie objection against that very non-difference, and then\nproceeds to refute it.\n\nOn the point in question the school of Ka _n_ ada argues as follows. It is in\nno way possible that the effect should be non-different from the cause. For\ncause and effect are the objects of different ideas: the ideas which have for\ntheir respective objects threads and a piece of cloth, or a lump of clay and a\njar, are distinctly not of one and the same kind. The difference of words\nsupplies a second argument; nobody applies to mere threads the word \'piece of\ncloth,\' or vice versa. A third argument rests on the difference of effects:\nwater is not fetched from the well in a lump of clay, nor is a well built with\njars. There, fourthly, is the difference of time; the cause is prior in time,\nthe effect posterior. There is, fifthly, the difference of form: the cause has\nthe shape of a lump, the effect (the jar) is shaped like a belly with a broad\nbasis; clay in the latter condition only is meant when we say \'The jar has\ngone to pieces.\' There, sixthly, is a numerical difference: the threads are\nmany, the piece of cloth is one only. In the seventh place, there is the\nuselessness of the activity of the producing agent (which would result from\ncause and effect being\n\np. 431\n\nidentical); for if the effect were nothing but the cause, what could be\neffected by the activity of the agent?--Let us then say that, although the\neffect _exists_ (at all times), the activity of the agent must be postulated\nas helpful towards the effect.--But in that case the activity of the agent\nwould have to be assumed as taking place perpetually, and as hence everything\nwould exist always, there would be no distinction between eternal and non-\neternal things!--Let us then say that the effect, although always existing, is\nat first non-manifest and then is manifested through the activity of the\nagent; in this way that activity will not be purposeless, and there will be a\ndistinction between eternal and non-eternal things!--This view also is\nuntenable. For if that manifestation requires another manifestation (to\naccount for it) we are driven into a _regressus in infinitum_. If, on the\nother hand, it is independent of another manifestation (and hence eternal), it\nfollows that the effect also is eternally perceived. And if, as a third\nalternative, the manifestation is said to originate, we lapse into the\nasatkaryavada (according to which the effect does not exist before its\norigination). Moreover, if the activity of the agent serves to manifest the\neffect, it follows that the activity devoted to a jar will manifest also\nwaterpots and similar things. For things which admittedly possess manifesting\npower, such as lamps and the like, are not observed to be restricted to\nparticular objects to be manifested by them: we do not see that a lamp lit for\nshowing a jar does _not_ at the same time manifest watcrpots and other things.\nAll this proves that the activity of the agent has a purpose in so far only as\nit is the cause of the origination of an effect which previously did _not_\nexist; and thus the theory of the previous existence of the effect cannot be\nupheld. Nor does the fact of definite causes having to be employed (in order\nto produce definite effects; clay e.g. to produce a jar) prove that that only\nwhich already exists can become an effect; for the facts explain themselves\nalso on the hypothesis of the cause having definite potentialities\n(determining the definite effect which will result from the cause).\n\np. 432\n\nBut, an objection is raised, he also who holds the theory of the previous non-\nexistence of the effect, can really do nothing with the activity of the agent.\nFor as, on his view, the effect has no existence before it is originated, the\nactivity of the agent must be supposed to operate elsewhere than on the\neffect; and as this \'elsewhere\' comprises without distinction all other\nthings, it follows that the agent\'s activity with reference to threads may\ngive rise to waterpots also (not only to cloth).--Not so, the Vai _s_ eshika\nreplies. Activity applied to a certain cause gives rise to those effects only\nthe potentiality of which inheres in that cause.\n\nNow, against all this, the following objection is raised. The effect is non-\ndifferent from the cause. For in reality there is no such thing as an effect\ndifferent from the cause, since all effects, and all empirical thought and\nspeech about effects, are based on Nescience. Apart from the causal substance,\nclay, which is seen to be present in effected things such as jars, the so-\ncalled effect, i.e. the jar or pot, rests altogether on Nescience. All\neffected things whatever, such as jars, waterpots, &c., viewed as different\nfrom their causal substance, viz. clay, which is perceived to exist in these\nits effects, rest merely on empirical thought and speech, and are\nfundamentally false, unreal; while the causal substance, i.e. clay, alone is\nreal. In the same way the entire world in so far as viewed apart from its\ncause, i.e. Brahman which is nothing but pure non-differenced Being, rests\nexclusively on the empirical assumption of Egoity and so on, and is false;\nwhile reality belongs to the causal Brahman which is mere Being. It follows\nthat there is no such thing as an effect apart from its cause; the effect in\nfact is identical with the cause. Nor must you object to our theory on the\nground that the corroborative instance of the silver erroneously imagined in\nthe shell is inappropriate because the non-reality of such effected things as\njars is by no means well proved while the non-reality of the shell-silver is\nso proved; for as a matter of fact it is determined by reasoning that it is\nthe causal substance of jars, viz. clay, only that is real while the\n\np. 433\n\nreality of everything apart from clay is disproved by reasoning. And if you\nask whereupon that reasoning rests, we reply--on the fact that the clay only\nis continuous, permanent, while everything different from it is discontinuous,\nnon-permanent. For just as in the case of the snake-rope we observe that the\ncontinuously existing rope only--which forms the substrate of the imagined\nsnake--is real, while the snake or cleft in the ground, which is non-\ncontinuous, is unreal; so we conclude that it is the permanently enduring\nclay-material only which is real, while the non-continuous effects, such as\njars and pots, are unreal. And, further, since what is real, i. e. the Self,\ndoes not perish, and what is altogether unreal, as e.g. the horn of a hare, is\nnot perceived, we conclude that an effected thing, which on the one hand is\nperceived and on the other is liable to destruction, must be viewed as\nsomething to be defined neither as that which is nor as that which is not. And\nwhat is thus undefinable, is false, no less than the silver imagined in the\nshell, the anirva _k_ aniyatva of which is proved by perception and sublation\n(see above, [p. 102](sbe48027.htm#page_102) ff.).--We further ask, \'Is a\ncausal substance, such as clay, when producing its effect, in a non-modified\nstate, or has it passed over into some special modified condition?\' The former\nalternative cannot be allowed, because thence it would follow that the cause\noriginates effects at all times; and the latter must equally be rejected,\nbecause the passing over of the cause into a special state would oblige us to\npostulate a previous passing over into a different state (to account for the\nlatter passing over) and again a previous one, &c., so that a _regressus in\ninfinitum_ would result.--Let it then be said that the causal substance when\ngiving rise to the effect is indeed unchanged, but connected with a special\noperative cause, time and place (this connexion accounting for the origination\nof the effect).--But this also we cannot allow; for such connexion would be\nwith the causal substance either as unchanged or as having entered on a\nchanged condition; and thus the difficulties stated above would arise again.--\nNor may you say that the origination of jars, gold coins, and sour milk from\nclay,\n\np. 434\n\ngold, and milk respectively is actually perceived; that this perception is not\nsublated with regard to time and place--while, on the other hand, the\nperception of silver in the shell is so sublated--and that hence all those who\ntrust perception must necessarily admit that the effect _does_ originate from\nthe cause. For this argumentation does not stand the test of being set forth\nin definite alternatives. Does the mere gold, &c., by itself originate the\nsvastika-ornament? or is it the gold coins (used for making ornaments) which\noriginate? or is it the gold, as forming the substrate of the coins 1? The\nmere gold, in the first place, cannot be originative as there exists no effect\ndifferent from the gold (to which the originative activity could apply\nitself); and a thing cannot possibly display originative activity with regard\nto itself.--But, an objection is raised, the svastika-ornament is perceived as\ndifferent from the gold!--It is not, we reply, different from the gold; for\nthe gold is recognised in it, and no other thing but gold is perceived.--But\nthe existence of another thing is proved by the fact of there being a\ndifferent idea, a different word, and so on!--By no means, we reply. Other\nideas, words, and so on, which have reference to an altogether undefined thing\nare founded on error, no less than the idea of, and the word denoting, shell-\nsilver, and hence have no power of proving the existence of another thing.\nNor, in the second place, is the _gold coin_ originative of the svastika-\nornament; for we do not perceive the coin in the svastika, as we do perceive\nthe threads in the cloth. Nor, in the third place, is the effect originated by\nthe gold in so far as being the substrate of the coin; for the gold in so far\nas forming the substrate of the coin is not perceived in the svastika. As it\nthus appears that all effects viewed apart from their causal\n\np. 435\n\nsubstances are unreal, we arrive at the conclusion that the entire world,\nviewed apart from Brahman, is also something unreal; for it also is an effect.\n\nIn order to facilitate the understanding of the truth that everything apart\nfrom Brahman is false, we have so far reasoned on the assumption of things\nsuch as clay, gold, &c., being real, and have thereby proved the non-reality\nof all effects. In truth, however, all special causal substances are unreal\nquite as much as jars and golden ornaments are; for they are all of them\nequally effects of Brahman.\n\n\'In that all this has its Self; it is the True\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 7); \'There\nis here no plurality; from death to death goes he who sees here plurality as\nit were\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 19); \'For where there is duality as it were,\nthere one sees another; but when for him the Self only has become all, whereby\nthen should he see and whom should he see?\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 13); \'Indra\ngoes manifold by means of his mayas\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 5, l9);--these and other\nsimilar texts teach that whatever is different from Brahman is false. Nor must\nit be imagined that the truth intimated by Scripture can be in conflict with\nPerception; for in the way set forth above we prove that all effects are\nfalse, and moreover Perception really has for its object pure Being only (cp.\nabove, [p. 30](sbe48007.htm#page_30)). And if there is a conflict between the\ntwo, superior force belongs to Scripture, to which no imperfection can be\nattributed; which occupies a final position among the means of knowledge; and\nwhich, although dependent on Perception, and so on, for the apprehension of\nthe form and meaning of words, yet is independent as far as proving power is\nconcerned. Hence it follows that everything different from Brahman, the\ngeneral cause, is unreal.\n\nNor must this conclusion be objected to on the ground that from the falsity of\nthe world it follows that the individual souls also are non-real. For it is\nBrahman itself which constitutes the individual souls: Brahman alone takes\nupon itself the condition of individual soul in all living bodies; as we know\nfrom many texts: \'Having entered into them with this living Self ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 3);\n\np. 436\n\n[paragraph continues] \'The one god hidden within all beings\' ( _S_ vet. Up.\nVI, 11); \'The one god entered in many places\'; \'That Self hidden in all beings\ndoes not shine forth\' (Ka. Up. I, 3,12); \'There is no other seer but he\' (B\n_ri_. Up. III, 3, 23); and others.--But if you maintain that the one Brahman\nconstitutes the soul in all living bodies, it follows that any particular pain\nor pleasure should affect the consciousness of all embodied beings, just as an\nagreeable sensation affecting the foot gives rise to a feeling of pleasure in\nthe head; and that there would be no distinction of individual soul and Lord,\nreleased souls and souls in bondage, pupils and teachers, men wise and\nignorant, and so on.\n\nNow, in reply to this, some of those who hold the non-duality of Brahman give\nthe following explanation. The many individual souls are the reflections of\nthe one Brahman, and their states of pain, pleasure, and so on, remain\ndistinct owing to the different limiting adjuncts (on which the existence of\neach individual soul as such depends), in the same way as the many reflected\nimages of one and the same face in mirrors, crystals, sword-blades, &c.,\nremain distinct owing to their limiting adjuncts (viz. mirrors, &c.); one\nimage being small, another large, one being bright, another dim, and so on.--\nBut you have said that scriptural texts such as \'Having entered with this\nliving Self show that the souls are not different from Brahman!--They are\nindeed not different in reality, but we maintain their distinction on the\nbasis of an imagined difference.--To whom then does that imagination belong?\nNot to Brahman surely whose nature, consisting of pure intelligence, allows no\nroom for imagination of any kind! Nor also to the individual souls; for this\nwould imply a faulty mutual dependence, the existence of the soul depending on\nimagination and that imagination residing in the soul! Not so, the advaita-\nvadin replies. Nescience (wrong imagination) and the existence of the souls\nform an endless retrogressive chain; their relation is like that of the seed\nand the sprout. Moreover, mutual dependence and the like, which are held to\nconstitute defects in the case of real things, are unable to disestablish\nNescience,\n\np. 437\n\nthe very nature of which consists in being that which cannot rationally be\nestablished, and which hence may be compared to somebody\'s swallowing a whole\npalace and the like (as seen in a dream or under the influence of a magical\nillusion). In reality the individual souls are non-different from Brahman, and\nhence essentially free from all impurity; but as they are liable to impurity\ncaused by their limiting adjuncts--in the same way as the face reflected in a\nmirror is liable to be dimmed by the dimness of the mirror--they may be the\nabodes of Nescience and hence may be viewed as the figments of wrong\nimagination. Like the dimness of the reflected face, the imperfection adhering\nto the soul is a mere error; for otherwise it would follow that the soul can\nnever obtain release. And as this error of the souls has proceeded from all\neternity, the question as to its cause is not to be raised.\n\nThis, we reply, is the view of teachers who have no insight into the true\nnature of aduality, and are prompted by the wish of capturing the admiration\nand applause of those who believe in the doctrine of duality. For if, as a\nfirst alternative, you should maintain that the abode of Nescience is\nconstituted by the soul in its essential, not fictitiously imagined, form;\nthis means that Brahman itself is the abode of Nescience. If, in the second\nplace, you should say that the abode of Nescience is the soul, viewed as\ndifferent from Brahman and fictitiously imagined in it, this would mean that\nthe Non-intelligent ( _g_ a _d_ a) is the abode of Nescience. For those who\nhold the view of Non-duality do not acknowledge a third aspect different from\nthese two (i.e. from Brahman which is pure intelligence, and the Non-\nintelligent fictitiously superimposed on Brahman). And if, as a third\nalternative, it be maintained that the abode of Nescience is the soul in its\nessential nature, this nature being however qualified by the fictitiously\nimagined aspect; we must negative this also, since that which has an\nabsolutely homogeneous nature cannot in any way be shown to be qualified,\napart from Nescience. The soul is qualified in so far only as it is the abode\nof Nescience, and you therefore define\n\np. 438\n\nnothing.--Moreover, the theory of Nescience abiding within the individual soul\nis resorted to for the purpose of establishing a basis for the distinction of\nbondage and release, but it really is quite unable to effect this. For if by\nRelease be understood the destruction of Nescience, it follows that when one\nsoul attains Release and Nescience is thus destroyed, the other souls also\nwill be released.--But Nescience persists because other souls are not\nreleased!--Well then the one soul also is not released since Nescience is not\ndestroyed!--But we assume a different Nescience for each soul; that soul whose\nNescience is destroyed will be released, and that whose Nescience is not\ndestroyed will remain in Bondage!--You now argue on the assumption of a\nspecial avidya for each soul. But what about the distinction of souls implied\ntherein? Is that distinction essential to the nature of the soul, or is it the\nfigment of Nescience? The former alternative is excluded, as it is admitted\nthat the soul essentially is pure, non-differenced intelligence; and because\non that alternative the assumption of avidya to account for the distinction of\nsouls would be purposeless. On the latter alternative two subordinate\nalternatives arise--Does this avidya which gives rise to the fictitious\ndistinction of souls belong to Brahman? or to the individual souls?--If you\nsay \'to Brahman\', your view coincides with mine.--Well then, \'to the souls\'!--\nBut have you then quite forgotten that Nescience is assumed for the purpose of\naccounting for the distinction of souls?--Let us then view the matter as\nfollows--those several avidyas which are assumed for the purpose of\nestablishing the distinction of souls bound and released, to those same\navidyas the distinction of souls is due.--But here you reason in a manifest\ncircle: the avidyas are established on the basis of the distinction of souls,\nand the distinction of souls is established when the avidyas are established.\nNor does the argument of the seed and sprout apply to the present question.\nFor in the case of seeds and plants each several seed gives rise to a\ndifferent plant; while in the case under discussion you adopt the impossible\nprocedure of establishing the\n\np. 439\n\nseveral avidyas on the basis of the very souls which are assumed to be due to\nthose avidyas. And if you attempt to give to the argument a somewhat different\nturn, by maintaining that it is the avidyas abiding in the earlier souls which\nfictitiously give rise to the later souls, we point out that this implies the\nsouls being short-lived only, and moreover that each soul would have to take\nupon itself the consequences of deeds not its own and escape the consequences\nof its own deeds. The same reasoning disposes of the hypothesis that it is\nBrahman which effects the fictitious existence of the subsequent souls by\nmeans of the avidyas abiding within the earlier souls. And if there is assumed\na beginningless flow of avidyas, it follows that there is also a beginningless\nflow of the condition of the souls dependent on those avidyas, and that steady\nuniformity of the state of the souls which is supposed to hold good up to the\nmoment of Release could thus not be established. Concerning your assertion\nthat, as Nescience is something unreal and hence altogether unproved, it is\nnot disestablished by such defects as mutual dependence which touch real\nthings only; we remark that in that case Nescience would cling even to\nreleased souls and the highest Brahman itself.--But impure Nescience cannot\ncling to what has for its essence pure cognition!--Is Nescience then to be\ndealt with by rational arguments? If so, it will follow that, on account of\nthe arguments set forth (mutual dependence, and so on), it likewise does not\ncling to the individual souls. We further put the following question--When the\nNescience abiding in the individual soul passes away, owing to the rise of the\nknowledge of truth, does then the soul also perish or does it not perish? In\nthe former case Release is nothing else but destruction of the essential\nnature of the soul; in the latter case the soul does not attain Release even\non the destruction of Nescience, since it continues to exist as soul different\nfrom Brahman.--You have further maintained that the distinction of souls as\npure and impure, &c., admits of being accounted for in the same way as the\ndimness or clearness, and so on, of the different images of a face as\n\np. 440\n\nseen reflected in mirrors, crystals, sword-blades and the like. But here the\nfollowing point requires consideration. On what occasion do the smallness,\ndimness and other imperfections due to the limiting adjuncts (i.e. the\nmirrors, &c.) pass away?--When the mirrors and other limiting adjuncts\nthemselves pass away!--Does then, we ask, the reflected image which is the\nsubstrate of those imperfections persist or not? If you say that it persists,\nthen by analogy the individual soul also must be assumed to persist, and from\nthis it follows that it does not attain Release. And if the reflected image is\nheld to perish together with its imperfections, by analogy the soul also will\nperish and then Release will be nothing but annihilation.--Consider the\nfollowing point also. The destruction of a non-advantageous (apurushartha)\ndefect is of advantage to him who is conscious of that disadvantage. Is it\nthen, we ask, in the given case Brahman--which corresponds to the thing\nreflected--that is conscious of the imperfections due to the limiting\nadjuncts? or is it the soul which corresponds to the reflected image? or is it\nsomething else? On the two former alternatives it appears that the comparison\n(between Brahman and the soul on the one hand, and the thing reflected and the\nreflection on the other--on which comparison your whole theory is founded)\ndoes not hold good; for neither the face nor the reflection of the face is\nconscious of the imperfections due to the adjuncts; for neither of the two is\na being capable of consciousness. And, moreover, Brahman\'s being conscious of\nimperfections would imply its being the abode of Nescience. And the third\nalternative, again, is impossible, since there is no other knowing subject\n_but_ Brahman and the soul.--It would, moreover, be necessary to define who is\nthe imaginatively shaping agent (kalpaka) with regard to the soul as formed\nfrom Nescience. It cannot be Nescience itself, because Nescience is not an\nintelligent principle. Nor can it be the soul, because this would imply the\ndefect of what has to be proved being presupposed for the purposes of the\nproof; and because the existence of the soul is that which _is formed_ by\nNescience, just as\n\np. 441\n\nshell-silver is. And if, finally, you should say that Brahman is the\nfictitiously forming agent, we have again arrived at a Brahman that is the\nabode of Nescience.--If Brahman is not allowed to be the abode of Nescience,\nwe further must ask whether Brahman sees (is conscious of) the individual\nsouls or not. If not, it is not possible that Brahman should give rise to this\nmanifold creation which, as Scripture declares, is preceded by \'seeing\' on his\npart, and to the differentiation of names and forms. If, on the other hand,\nBrahman which is of an absolutely homogeneous nature sees the souls, it cannot\ndo so without Nescience; and thus we are again led to the view of Nescience\nabiding in Brahman.\n\nFor similar reasons the theory of the distinction of Maya and Nescience must\nalso be abandoned. For even if Brahman possesses Maya, i.e. illusive power, it\ncannot, without Nescience, be conscious of souls. And without being conscious\nof others the lord of Maya is unable to delude them by his Maya; and Maya\nherself cannot bring about the consciousness of others on the part of its\nLord, for it is a mere means to delude others, after they have (by other\nmeans) become objects of consciousness.--Perhaps you will say that the Maya of\nBrahman causes him to be conscious of souls, and at the same time is the cause\nof those souls\' delusion. But if Maya causes Brahman--which is nothing but\nself-illuminated intelligence, absolutely homogeneous and free from all\nforeign elements--to become conscious of other beings, then Maya is nothing\nbut another name for Nescience.--Let it then be said that Nescience is the\ncause of the cognition of what is contrary to truth; such being the case, Maya\nwhich presents all false things different from Brahman as false, and thus is\nnot the cause of wrong cognition on the part of Brahman, is _not_ avidya.--But\nthis is inadmissible; for, when the oneness of the moon is known, that which\ncauses the idea of the moon being double can be nothing else but avidya.\nMoreover, if Brahman recognises all beings apart from himself as false, he\ndoes not delude them; for surely none but a madman would aim at deluding\nbeings known by him to be unreal!--\n\np. 442\n\n[paragraph continues] Let us then define avidya as the cause of a\ndisadvantageous cognition of unreal things. Maya then, as not being the cause\nof such a disadvantageous cognition on Brahman\'s part, cannot be of the nature\nof avidya!--But this also is inadmissible; for although the idea of the moon\nbeing double is not the cause of any pain, and hence not disadvantageous to\nman, it is all the same caused by avidya; and if, on the other hand, Maya\nwhich aims at dispelling that idea (in so far as it presents the image and\nidea of one moon) did not present what is of disadvantage, it would not be\nsomething to be destroyed, and hence would be permanently connected with\nBrahman\'s nature.--Well, if it were so, what harm would there be?--The harm\nwould be that such a view implies the theory of duality, and hence would be in\nconflict with the texts inculcating non-duality such as \'For where there is\nduality as it were, &c.; but when for him the Self only has become all,\nwhereby then should he see, and whom should he see?\'--But those texts set\nforth the Real; Maya on the other hand is non-real, and hence the view of its\npermanency is not in real conflict with the texts!--Brahman, we reply, has for\nits essential nature unlimited bliss, and hence cannot be conscious of, or\naffected with, unreal Maya, without avidya. Of what use, we further ask,\nshould an eternal non-real Maya be to Brahman?--Brahman by means of it deludes\nthe individual souls!--But of what use should such delusion be to Brahman?--It\naffords to Brahman a kind of sport or play!--But of what use is play to a\nbeing whose nature is unlimited bliss?--Do we not then see in ordinary life\nalso that persons in the enjoyment of full happiness and prosperity indulge\nall the same in play?--The cases are not parallel, we reply. For none but\npersons not in their right mind would take pleasure in an unreal play, carried\non by means of implements unreal and known by them to be unreal, and in the\nconsciousness, itself, unreal of such a play!--The arguments set forth\npreviously also prove the impossibility of the fictitious existence of an\nindividual soul considered as the abode of avidya, apart from Brahman\nconsidered as the abode of Maya.\n\np. 443\n\nWe thus arrive at the conclusion that those who hold the non-duality of\nBrahman must also admit that it is Brahman alone which is affected with\nbeginningless avidya, and owing to this avidya is conscious of plurality\nwithin itself. Nor must it be urged against him who holds this view of avidya\nbelonging to Brahman that he is unable to account for the distinction of\nbondage and release, for as there is only the one Brahman affected with\nNescience and to be released by the cessation of that Nescience, the\ndistinction of souls bound and released, &c., has no true existence: the\nempirical distinction of souls bound and released, of teachers and pupils, &c.\nis a merely fictitious one, and all such fiction can be explained by means of\nthe avidya of one intelligent being. The case is analogous to that of a person\ndreaming: the teachers and pupils and all the other persons and things he may\nsee in his dream are fictitiously shaped out of the avidya of the one dreaming\nsubject. For the same reason there is no valid foundation for the assumption\nof many avidyas. For those also who hold that avidya belongs to the individual\nsouls do not maintain that the distinction of bondage and release, of one\'s\nown self and other persons, is real; and if it is unreal it can be accounted\nfor by the avidya of one subject. This admits of being stated in various\ntechnical ways.--The distinctions of bondage and of one\'s own self and other\npersons are fictitiously shaped by one\'s own avidya; for they are unreal like\nthe distinctions seen by a dreaming person.--Other bodies also have a Self\nthrough me only; for they are bodies like this my body.--Other bodies also are\nfictitiously shaped by my avidya; for they are bodies or effects, or non-\nintelligent or fictitious creations, as this my body is.--The whole class of\nintelligent subjects is nothing but _me_ ; for they are of intelligent nature;\nwhat is _not me_ is seen to be of non-intelligent nature; as e.g. jars.--It\nthus follows that the distinctions of one\'s own self and other persons, of\nsouls bound and released, of pupils and teachers, and so on, are fictitiously\ncreated by the avidya of one intelligent subject.\n\nThe fact is that the upholder of Duality himself is not\n\np. 444\n\nable to account for the distinction of souls bound and released. For as there\nis an infinity of past aeons, it follows that, even if one soul only should\nattain release in each aeon, all souls would by this time have attained\nrelease; the actual existence of non-released souls cannot thus be rationally\naccounted for.--But the souls are \'infinite\'; this accounts for there being\nsouls not yet released!--What, pray, do you understand by this \'infinity\' of\nsouls? Does it mean that they cannot be counted? This we cannot allow, for\nalthough a being of limited knowledge may not be able to count them, owing to\ntheir large number, the all-knowing Lord surely can count them; if he could\nnot do so it would follow that he is not all-knowing.--But the souls are\nreally numberless, and the Lord\'s not knowing a definite number which does not\nexist does not prove that he is not all-knowing!--Not so, we reply. Things\nwhich are definitely separate (bhinna) from each other cannot be without\nnumber. Souls have a number, because they are separate; just as mustard seeds,\nbeans, earthen vessels, pieces of cloth, and so on. And from their being\nseparate it moreover follows that souls, like earthen vessels, and so on, are\nnon-intelligent, not of the nature of Self, and perishable; and it further\nfollows therefrom that Brahman is not infinite. For by infinity we understand\nthe absence of all limitation. Now on the theory which holds that there is a\nplurality of separate existences, Brahman which is considered to differ in\ncharacter from other existences cannot be said to be free from substantial\nlimitation; for substantial limitation means nothing else than the existence\nof other substances. And what is substantially limited cannot be said to be\nfree from temporal and spatial limitation; for observation shows that it is\njust those things which differ in nature from other things and thus are\nsubstantially limited--such as earthen vessels, and so on--which are also\nlimited in point of space and time. Hence all intelligent existences,\nincluding Brahman, being substantially limited, are also limited in point of\nspace and time. But this conclusion leads to a conflict with those scriptural\ntexts which declare Brahman to be free from all limitation whatsoever\n\np. 445\n\n[paragraph continues] (\'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman,\' and similar\ntexts), and moreover would imply that the souls as well as Brahman are liable\nto origination, decay, and so on; for limitation in time means nothing else\nbut a being\'s passing through the stages of origination, decay, and so on.\n\nThe dvaita-view thus being found untenable on all sides, we adhere to our\ndoctrine that this entire world, from Brahma down to a blade of grass, springs\nfrom the avidya attached to Brahman which in itself is absolutely unlimited;\nand that the distinctions of consciousness of pleasure and pain, and all\nsimilar distinctions, explain themselves from the fact of all of them being of\nthe nature of avidya, just as the distinctions of which a dreaming person is\nconscious. The one Brahman, whose nature is eternal self-illuminedness, free\nfrom all heterogeneous elements, owing to the influence of avidya illusorily\nmanifests itself (vivarttate) in the form of this world; and as thus in\nreality there exists nothing whatever different from Brahman, we hold that the\nworld is \'non-different\' from Brahman.\n\nTo this the Dvaitavadin, i.e. the Vai _s_ eshika, replies as follows. The\ndoctrine that Brahman, which in itself is pure, non-differenced self-\nilluminedness, has its own true nature hidden by avidya and hence sees\nplurality within itself, is in conflict with all the valid means of right\nknowledge; for as Brahman is without parts, obscuration, i.e. cessation, of\nthe light of Brahman, would mean complete destruction of Brahman; so that the\nhypothesis of obscuration is altogether excluded. This and other arguments\nhave been already set forth; as also that the hypothesis of obscuration\ncontradicts other views held by the Advaitin. Nor is there any proof for the\nassertion that effects apart from their causes are mere error, like shell-\nsilver, the separate existence of the effect being refuted by Reasoning; for\nas a matter of fact there is no valid reasoning of the kind. The assertion\nthat the cause only is real because it persists, while the non-continuous\neffects--such as jars and waterpots--are unreal, has also been refuted before,\non the ground that the fact of a thing not existing at one place and one time\ndoes not sublate its\n\np. 446\n\nreal existence at another time and place. Nor is there any soundness in the\nargumentation that the effect is false because, owing to its being perceived\nand its being perishable, it cannot be defined either as real or unreal. For a\nthing\'s being perceived and its being perishable does not prove the thing\'s\nfalseness, but only its non-permanency. To prove a thing\'s falseness it is\nrequired to show that it is sublated (i.e. that its non-existence is proved by\nvalid means) with reference to that very place and time in connexion with\nwhich it is perceived; but that a thing is sublated with reference to a place\nand time _other_ than those in connexion with which it is perceived, proves\nonly that the thing does not exist in connexion with that place and time, but\nnot that it is false. This view also may be put in technical form, viz.\neffects such as jars and the like are real because they are not sublated with\nregard to their definite place and time; just as the Self is.--Nor is there\nany truth in the assertion that the effect cannot originate from the cause\neither modified or unmodified; for the effect may originate from the cause if\nconnected with certain favouring conditions of place, time, &c. Nor can you\nshow any proof for the assertion that the cause, whether modified or non-\nmodified, cannot enter into connexion with such favouring conditions; as a\nmatter of fact the cause may very well, without being modified, enter into\nsuch connexion.--But from this it follows that the cause must have been\npreviously connected with those conditions, since previously also it was\nequally unmodified!--Not so, we reply. The connexion with favouring conditions\nof time, place, &c., into which the cause enters, depends on some other cause,\nand not therefore on the fact of its not being modified. No fault then can be\nfound with the view of the cause, when having entered into a special state\ndepending on its connexion with time, place, &c., producing the effect. Nor\ncan it be denied in any way that the cause possesses originative agency with\nregard to the effect; for such agency is actually observed, and cannot be\nproved to be irrational.--Further there is no proof for the assertion that\noriginative agency cannot belong\n\np. 447\n\neither to mere gold or to a (first) effect of gold such as coined gold, or to\ngold in so far as forming the substrate for coins and the like; for as a\nmatter of fact mere gold (gold in general), if connected with the helpful\nfactors mentioned above, may very well possess originative capacity. To say\nthat we do not perceive any effect different from gold is futile; for as a\nmatter of fact we perceive the svastika-ornament which is different from mere\ngold, and the existence of different terms and ideas moreover proves the\nexistence of different things. Nor have we here to do with a mere error\nanalogous to that of shell-silver. For a real effected thing, such as a golden\nornament, is perceived during the whole period intervening between its\norigination and destruction, and such perception is not sublated with regard\nto that time and place. Nor is there any valid line of reasoning to sublate\nthat perception. That at the same time when the previously non-perceived\nsvastika-ornament is perceived the gold also is recognised, is due to the fact\nof the gold persisting as the substrate of the ornament, and hence such\nrecognition of the causal substance does not disprove the reality of the\neffect.--And the attempts to prove the unreality of the world by means of\nscriptural texts we have already disposed of in a previous part of this work.\n\nWe further object to the assertion that it is one Self which bestows on all\nbodies the property of being connected with the Self; as from this it would\nfollow that one person is conscious of all the pains and pleasures caused by\nall bodies. For, as seen in the case of Saubhari and others, it is owing to\nthe oneness of the Self that one person is conscious of the pains and\npleasures due to several bodies. Nor again must you allege that the non-\nconsciousness (on the part of one Self of all pleasures and pains whatever),\nis due to the plurality of the Egos, which are the subjects of cognition, and\nnot to the plurality of Selfs; for the Self is none other than the subject of\ncognition and the Ego. The organ of egoity (aha _m_ kara), on the other hand,\nwhich is the same as the internal organ (anta _h_ kara _n_ a), cannot be the\nknowing subject, for it is of a non-intelligent nature, and is a mere\ninstrument like the\n\np. 448\n\nbody and the sense-organs. This also has been proved before.--Nor is there any\nproof for your assertion that all bodies must be held to spring from the\navidya of one subject, because they are bodies, non-intelligent, effects,\nfictitious. For that all bodies are the fictitious creations of avidya is not\ntrue; since that which is not sublated by valid means of proof must be held to\nbe real.--Nor again can you uphold the assertion that all intelligent subjects\nare non-different, i.e. one, because we observe that whatever is other than a\nsubject of cognition is non-intelligent; for this also is disproved by the\nfact of the plurality of intelligent subjects as proved by the individual\ndistribution, among them, of pleasures and pains.--You have further maintained\n\'Through me only all bodies are animated by a Self; they are the fictitious\ncreations of _my_ avidya; _I_ alone constitute the whole aggregate of\nintelligent subjects,\' and, on the basis of these averments, have attempted to\nprove the oneness of the Ego. But all this is nothing but the random talk of a\nperson who has not mastered even the principles of his own theory; for\naccording to your theory the Self is pure intelligence to which the whole\ndistinction of \'I,\' \'Thou,\' &c., is altogether foreign. Moreover, if it be\nheld that everything different from pure, non-differenced intelligence is\nfalse, it follows that all effort spent on learning the Veda with a view to\nRelease is fruitless, for the Veda also is the effect of avidya, and the\neffort spent on it therefore is analogous to the effort of taking hold of the\nsilver wrongly imagined in the shell. Or, to put it from a different point of\nview, all effort devoted to Release is purposeless, since it is the effect of\nknowledge depending on teachers of merely fictitious existence. Knowledge\nproduced by texts such as \'Thou art that\' does not put an end to bondage,\nbecause it is produced by texts which are the fictitious product of avidya; or\nbecause it is itself of the nature of avidya; or because it has for its abode\nknowing subjects, who are mere creatures of avidya; or because it is the\nproduct of a process of study which depends on teachers who are the mere\ncreatures of avidya; it is thus no better than knowledge resting on texts\nteaching\n\np. 449\n\nhow bondage is to be put an end to, which one might have heard in a dream. Or,\nto put the matter again from a different point of view, Brahman constituted by\npure non-differenced intelligence is false, since it is to be attained by\nknowledge, which is the effect of avidya; or since it is to be attained by\nknowledge abiding in knowing subjects who are mere figments of avidya; or\nbecause it is attained through knowledge which is the mere figment of avidya.\nFor whatever is attained through knowledge of that kind is false; as e.g. the\nthings seen in dreams or a town of the Gandharvas (Fata Morgana).\n\nNor does Brahman, constituted by pure non-differenced intelligence, shine\nforth by itself, so as not to need--for its cognition--other means of\nknowledge. And that that self-luminous knowledge which you declare to be borne\nwitness to by itself, really consists in the knowledge of particular objects\nof knowledge--such knowledge abiding in particular cognising subjects--this\nalso has been proved previously. And the different arguments which were set\nforth as proving Brahman\'s non-differenced nature, are sufficiently refuted by\nwhat we have said just now as to all such arguments themselves being the\nproducts of avidya.\n\nNor again is there any sense in the theory that the principle of non-\ndifferenced intelligence \'witnesses\' avidya, and implicates itself in the\nerror of the world. For \'witnessing\' and error are observed to abide only in\ndefinite conscious subjects, not in consciousness in general. Nor can that\nprinciple of pure intelligence be proved to possess illumining power or light\ndepending on itself only. For by light (enlightenment) we can understand\nnothing but definite well-established knowledge (siddhi) on the part of some\nknowing subject with regard to some particular object. It is on this basis\nonly that you yourself prove the self-illumincdness of your universal\nprinciple; to an absolutely non-differenced intelligence not implying the\ndistinction of subject and object such \'svayampraka _s_ ata\' could not\npossibly belong. With regard again to what you so loudly proclaim at your\nmeetings, viz. that real effects are seen to spring even from unreal causes,\nwe point\n\np. 450\n\nout that although you allow to such effects, being non-sublatcd as it were, a\nkind of existence called \'empirical\' (or \'conventional\'--vyavaharika), you\nyourself acknowledge that fundamentally they are nothing but products of\navidya; you thus undermine your own position. We have, on the other hand,\nalready disposed of this your view above, when proving that in all cases\neffects are originated by real causes only. Nor may you plead that what\nperception tells us in such cases is contradicted by Scripture; for as,\naccording to you, Scripture itself is an effect, and hence of the essence of\navidya, it is in no better case than the instances quoted. You have further\ndeclared that, although Brahman is to be attained only through unreal\nknowledge, yet it is real since when once attained it is not sublated by any\nsubsequent cognition. But this reasoning also is not valid; for when it has\nonce been ascertained that some principle is attained through knowledge\nresting on a vicious basis, the fact that we are not aware of a subsequent\nsublation of that principle is irrelevant. That the principle \'the reality of\nthings is a universal Void\' is false, we conclude therefrom that the reasoning\nleading to that principle is ascertained to be ill-founded, although we are\nnot aware of any subsequent truth sublating that principle. Moreover, for\ntexts such as \'There is here no plurality whatsoever\', \'Knowledge, bliss is\nBrahman,\' the absence of subsequent sublation is claimed on the ground that\nthey negative the whole aggregate of things different from mere intelligence,\nand hence are later in order than all other texts (which had established that\naggregate of things). But somebody may rise and say \'the Reality is a Void\',\nand thus negative the existence of the principle of mere Intelligence also;\nand the latter principle is thus sublated by the assertion as to the Void,\nwhich is later in order than the texts which it negatives. On the other hand\nthe assertion as to the Void being the universal principle is not liable to\nsubsequent sublation; for it is impossible for any negation to go beyond it.\nAnd as to resting on a vicious basis, there is in that respect no difference\nbetween Perception and the other means of\n\np. 451\n\nknowledge, and the view of general unreality, founded on the Vedanta. The\nproper conclusion therefore is that all cognitions whatsoever abide in real\nsubjects of cognition and are themselves real, consisting in mental certainty\nwith regard to special objects. Some of these cognitions rest on defects which\nthemselves are real; others spring from a combination of causes, real and free\nfrom all defect. Unless we admit all this we shall not be able to account in a\nsatisfactory way for the distinction of things true and things false, and for\nall empirical thought. For empirical thought, whether true or of the nature of\nerror, presupposes inward light (illumination) in the form of certainty with\nregard to a particular object, and belonging to a real knowing subject; mere\nnon-differenced Being, on the other hand (not particularised in the form of a\nknowing subject), cannot be the cause of states of consciousness, whether\nreferring to real or Unreal things, and cannot therefore form the basis of\nempirical thought.\n\nAgainst our opponent\'s argument that pure Being must be held the real\nsubstrate of all erroneous superimposition (adhyasa), for the reason that no\nerror can exist without a substrate, we remark that an error may take place\neven when its substrate is unreal, in the same way as an error may exist even\nwhen the defect (giving rise to the error), the abode of the defect, the\nsubject of cognition and the cognition itself are unreal. The argument thus\nloses its force. Possibly he will now argue that as an error is never seen to\nexist where the substrate is unreal, the reality of pure Being (as furnishing\nthe required basis for error) must necessarily be admitted. But, we point out,\nit also is a fact that errors are never observed where the defect, the abode\nof the defect, the knowing subject and the act of knowledge are unreal; and if\nwe pay regard to observation, we must therefore admit the reality of all these\nfactors as well. There is really no difference between the two cases, unless\nour opponent chooses to be obstinate.\n\nYou further asserted that, on the theory of many really different Selfs, it\nwould follow from the infinity of the past aeons that all souls must have been\nreleased before this,\n\np. 452\n\nnone being left in the state of bondage; and that hence the actually observed\ndistinction of souls bound and released remains unexplained. But this\nargumentation is refuted by the fact of the souls also being infinite. You\nindeed maintained that, if the souls are really separate, they must\nnecessarily have a definite number like beans, mustard-seeds, earthen vessels,\nand so on; but these instances are beside the point, as earthen vessels, and\nso on, are also infinite in number.--But do we not actually see that all these\nthings have definite numbers, \'Here are ten jars; a thousand beans,\' &c.?--\nTrue, but those numbers do not belong to the essential nature of jars, and so\non, but only to jars in so far as connected with time, place, and other\nlimiting adjuncts. And that souls also have definite numbers in this sense, we\nreadily admit. And from this it does not follow that all souls should be\nreleased; for essentially the souls are infinite (in number).--Nor are you\nentitled to maintain that the real separation of individual souls would imply\nthat, as earthen vessels and the like, they are non-intelligent, not of the\nnature of Self, and perishable. For the circumstance of individuals of one\nspecies being distinct from each other, does in no way imply that they possess\nthe characteristics of things belonging to another species: the individual\nseparation of jars does not imply their having the characteristics of pieces\nof cloth.--You further maintain that from the hypothesis of a real plurality\nof souls it follows that Brahman is substantially limited, and in consequence\nof this limited with regard to time and space also, and that hence its\ninfinity is disproved. But this also is a mistaken conclusion. Things\nsubstantially limited may be limited more or less with regard to time and\nplace: there is no invariable rule on this point, and the measure of their\nconnexion with space and time has hence to be determined in dependence on\nother means of knowledge. Now Brahman\'s connexion with _all_ space and _all_\ntime results from such other means of proof, and hence there is no\ncontradiction (between this non-limitation with regard to space and time, and\nits limitation in point of substance--\n\np. 453\n\nwhich is due to the existence of other souls).--But mere substantial\nlimitation, as meaning the absence of non-limitation of any kind, by itself\nproves that Brahman is not infinite!--Well, then you yourself are in no better\ncase; for you admit that Brahman is something different from avidya. From this\nadmission it follows that Brahman also is something \'different\', and thus all\nthe disadvantages connected with the view of difference cling to your theory\nas well. If on the other hand it should not be allowed that Brahman differs in\nnature from avidya, then Brahman\'s nature itself is constituted by avidya, and\nthe text defining Brahman as \'the True, knowledge, infinite\' is contrary to\nsense.--If the reality of \'difference\' is not admitted, then there is no\nlonger any distinction between the proofs and the mutual objections set forth\nby the advocates of different theories, and we are landed in general\nconfusion. The proof of infinity, we further remark, rests altogether on the\nabsence of limitation of space and time, not on absence of substantial\nlimitation; absence of such limitation is something very much akin to the\n\'horn of a hare\' and is perceived nowhere. On the view of difference, on the\nother hand, the whole world, as constituting Brahman\'s body, is its mode, and\nBrahman is thus limited neither through itself nor through other things.--We\nthus arrive at the conclusion that, as effects are real in so far as different\nfrom their cause, the effect of Brahman, i.e. the entire world, is different\nfrom Brahman.\n\nAgainst this view the Sutra now declares itself as follows.--The non-\ndifference of the world from Brahman, the highest cause, follows from \'what\nbegins with the word arambhana\'--which proves such non-difference; \'what\nbegins with the word arambhana\' means those clauses at the head of which that\nword is met with, viz. \'va _k_ arambhana _m_ vikaro namadheya _m_ m _ri_\nttikety eva satyam\'; \'Being only this was in the beginning, one only, without\na second\'; \'it thought, may I be many, may I grow forth; it sent forth fire\';\n\'having entered with this living Self; \'In the True, my son, all these\ncreatures have their root, in the True they dwell, in the True they rest\'; \'In\nthat all\n\np. 454\n\nthat exists has its Self; it is the True, it is the Self; and thou art it, O\n_S_ vetaketu\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 1-8)--it is these clauses and others of similar\npurport which are met with in other chapters, that the Sutra refers to. For\nthese texts prove the non-difference from Brahman of the world consisting of\nnon-sentient and sentient beings. This is as follows. The teacher, bearing in\nhis mind the idea of Brahman constituting the sole cause of the entire world\nand of the non-difference of the effect from the cause, asks the pupil, \'Have\nyou ever asked for that instruction by which the non-heard is heard, the non-\nperceived is perceived, the not known is known\'; wherein there is implied the\npromise that, through the knowledge of Brahman the general cause, its effect,\ni.e. the whole Universe, will be known? The pupil, not knowing that Brahman is\nthe sole cause of the Universe, raises a doubt as to the possibility of one\nthing being known through another,\'How then, Sir, is that instruction?\' and\nthe teacher thereupon, in order to convey the notion of Brahman being the sole\nuniversal cause, quotes an instance showing that the non-difference of the\neffect from the cause is proved by ordinary experience, \'As by one clod of\nclay there is known everything that is made of clay\'; the meaning being \'as\njars, pots, and the like, which are fashioned out of one piece of clay, are\nknown through the cognition of that clay, since their substance is not\ndifferent from it.\'In order to meet the objection that according to Ka _n_\nada\'s doctrine the effect constitutes a substance different from the cause,\nthe teacher next proceeds to prove the non-difference of the effect from the\ncause by reference to ordinary experience, \'va _k_ arambhana _m_ vikaro\nnamadheya _m_ m _ri_ ttikety eva satyam\'. \xc3\x82rambhanam must here be explained as\nthat which is taken or touched (a-rabh=a-labh; and \'alambha _h_ spar _s_ ahi\n_m_ sayo _h_ \'); compare Pa _n_ ini III, 3, 113, as to the form and meaning of\nthe word. \'Va _k_ a,\' \'on account of speech,\' we take to mean \'on account of\nactivity preceded by speech\'; for activities such as the fetching of water in\na pitcher are preceded by speech,\'Fetch water in the pitcher,\' and so on. For\nthe bringing about of such activity, the material clay\n\np. 455\n\n(which had been mentioned just before) touches (enters into contact with) an\neffect (vikara), i.e. a particular make or configuration, distinguished by\nhaving a broad bottom and resembling the shape of a belly, and a special name\n(namadheya), viz. _pitcher_ , and so on, which is applied to that effect; or,\nto put it differently, to the end that certain activities may be accomplished,\nthe substance clay receives a new configuration and a new name. 1 Hence jars\nand other things of clay are clay (mrittika), i.e. are of the substance of\nclay, only; this _only_ is true (satyam),i.e. known through authoritative\nmeans of proof; _only_ (eva), because the effects are not known as different\nsubstances. One and the same substance therefore, such as clay or gold, gives\noccasion for different ideas and words only as it assumes different\nconfigurations; just as we observe that one and the same Devadatta becomes the\nobject of different ideas and terms, and gives rise to different effects,\naccording to the different stages of life--youth, old age, &c.--which he has\nreached.--The fact of our saying \'the jar has perished\' while yet the clay\npersists, was referred to by the Purvapakshin as proving that the effect is\nsomething different from the cause; but this view is disproved by the view\nheld by us that origination, destruction, and so on, are merely different\nstates of one and the same causal substance. According as one and the same\nsubstance is in this or that state, there belong to it different terms and\ndifferent activities, and these different states may rightly be viewed as\ndepending on the activity\n\np. 456\n\nof an agent. The objections again which are connected with the theory of\n\'manifestation\' are refuted by our not acknowledging such a thing at all as\n\'manifestation.\' Nor does the admission of origination render the doctrine of\nthe reality of the effect irrational; for it is only the Real that originates.\n--But it is a contradiction to maintain that that which previously exists is\noriginated!--This, we reply, is the objection of a person who knows nothing\nabout the true nature of origination and destruction. A substance enters into\ndifferent states in succession; what passes away is the substance in its\nprevious states, what originates is the substance in its subsequent states. As\nthus the substance in all its states has being, there is nothing irrational in\nthe satkarya theory.--But the admission of the origination of a non-existing\nstate lands us in the asatkarya theory!--If he, we retort, who holds the\nasatkarya theory is of opinion that the origination of the effect does not\nitself originate, he is similarly landed in the satkarya theory; and if he\nholds that the origination itself originates, he is led into a _regressus in\ninfinitum_. According to us, on the other hand, who hold that states are\nincapable of being apprehended and of acting apart from that of which they are\nstates, origination, destruction, and so on, belong only to a substance which\nis in a certain state; and on this theory no difficulty remains. And in the\nsame way as the state of being a jar results from the clay abandoning the\ncondition of being either two halves of a jar or a lump of clay, plurality\nresults from a substance giving up the state of oneness, and oneness from the\ngiving up of plurality; hence this point also gives rise to no difficulty.\n\nWe now consider the whole _Kh_ andogya-text in connexion. \'Sad eva somyedam\nagra asid ekam evadvitiyam.\' This means--That which is Being, i.e. this world\nwhich now, owing to the distinction of names and forms, bears a manifold\nshape, was in the beginning one only, owing to the absence of the distinction\nof names and forms. And as, owing to the \'Sat\' being endowed with all powers,\na further ruling principle is out of the question, the world was\n\np. 457\n\nalso \'without a second.\' This proves the non-difference of the world from\nBrahman. In the same way the next clause also,\' It thought, may I be many, may\nI grow forth,\' which describes the creation of the world as proceeding from a\nresolve of the Self to differentiate itself into a world consisting of\nmanifold beings movable and immovable, viz. Fire, and so on, enables us to\ndetermine that the effect, i. e. the world, is non-different from the highest\ncause, i.e. the highest Brahman.\n\nAnd as now a further doubt may arise as to how the highest Brahman with all\nits perfections can be designated as one with the world, and how the world can\nbe designated as one, without a second, not dependent on another guiding\nprinciple; and how this thought, i.e. the resolution, on the part of the\nSupreme cause, of differentiating itself into a manifold world, and the\ncreation corresponding to that resolution are possible; the text\ncontinues,\'That deity thought--Let me now enter those three beings with this\nliving Self ( _g_ iva atman) and distinguish names and forms\'--which means,\n\'Let me make the aggregate of non-sentient things (for this is meant by the\n"three beings") to possess various names and forms, by entering into them by\nmeans of the giva. which is of the nature of my Self.\'The possession of names\nand forms must thus be understood to be effected by the _g_ iva entering into\nmatter as its Self. There is another scriptural text also which makes it clear\nthat the highest Brahman enters, so as to be their Self, into the world\ntogether with the _g_ ivas. \'Having sent forth that he entered into it. Having\nentered into it he became sat and tyat (i.e. sentient and non-sentient\nbeings).\'And that the entire aggregate of sentient and non-sentient beings,\ngross or subtle, in their effected or their causal state, constitutes the body\nof the highest Brahman, and that on the other hand the highest Brahman\nconstitutes their Self--this is proved by the antaryamin-brahma _n_ a and\nsimilar texts. This disposes of the doubt raised above. Since Brahman abides,\nas their Self, in all non-sentient matter together with the _g_ ivas, Brahman\nis denoted by the term \'world\' in so far only as it (i.e.\n\np. 458\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman) has non-sentient and sentient beings for its\nbody, and hence utterances such as \'This which is Being only was in the\nbeginning one only\' are unobjectionable in every way. All change and all\nimperfection belongs only to the beings constituting Brahman\'s body, and\nBrahman itself is thus proved to be free from all imperfection, a treasure as\nit were of all imaginable holy qualites. This point will be further elucidated\nunder II, 1, 22.--The _Kh_ andogya-text then further teaches that all sentient\nand non-sentient beings have their Self in Brahman \'in that all this has its\nSelf; and further inculcates this truth in \'Thou art that.\'\n\nTexts met with in other sections also teach this same non-difference of the\ngeneral cause and its effect: \'All this indeed is Brahman\' ( _Kh_. Up. III,\n14, 1); \'When the Self has been seen, heard, perceived, and known, then all\nthis is known\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 6); \'That Self is all this\' (B _ri_. Up.\nII, 4, 6); \'Brahman indeed is all this\' (Mai. Up. IV, 6); \'The Self only is\nall this\' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 25, 2). Other texts, too, negative difference:\n\'Everything abandons him who looks for anything elsewhere than in the Self (B\n_ri_. Up. II, 4, 6); \'There is not any plurality here\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4,\n19); \'From death to death goes he who sees here any plurality\' (B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 4, 19). And in the same spirit the passage \'For where there is duality as\nit were, one sees the other; but when for him the Self has become all, whereby\nthen should he sec and whom?\'(B _ri_. Up. 11,4, l3)--in setting forth that the\nview of duality belongs to him who does not know and the view of non-duality\nto him who knows--intimates that non-difference only is real.\n\nIt is in this way that we prove, by means of the texts beginning with arambha\n_n_ a, that the world is non-different from the universal cause, i.e. the\nhighest Brahman. Brahman only, having the aggregate of sentient and non-\nsentient beings for its body and hence for its modes (prakara), is denoted by\nall words whatsoever. The body of this Brahman is sometimes constituted by\nsentient and non-sentient beings in their subtle state, when--just owing to\nthat subtle state--they are incapable of being (conceived\n\np. 459\n\nand) designated as apart from Brahman whose body they form: Brahman is then in\nits so-called causal condition. At other times the body of Brahman is\nconstituted by all sentient and non-sentient beings in their gross, manifest\nstate, owing to which they admit of being thought and spoken of as having\ndistinct names and forms: Brahman then is in its \'effected\' state. The effect,\ni.e. the world, is thus seen to be non-different from the cause, i.e. the\nhighest Brahman. And that in the effected as well as the causal state of\nBrahman\'s body as constituted by sentient and non-sentient beings, and of\nBrahman embodied therein, perfections and imperfections are distributed\naccording to the difference of essential nature between Brahman and its body,\nas proved by hundreds of scriptural texts, we have shown above.\n\nThose on the other hand who establish the non-difference of cause and effect,\non the basis of the theory of the effect\'s non-reality, are unable to prove\nwhat they wish to prove; for the True and the False cannot possibly be one. If\nthese two were one, it would follow either that Brahman is false or that the\nworld is real.--Those again who (like Bhaskara) hold the effect also to be\nreal--the difference of the soul and Brahman being due to limiting conditions,\nwhile their non-difference is essential; and the difference as well as the\nnon-difference of Brahman and matter being essential--enter into conflict with\nall those texts which declare that the soul and Brahman are distinct in so far\nas the soul is under the power of karman while Brahman is free from all evil,\n&c., and all those texts which teach that non-sentient matter undergoes\nchanges while Brahman does not. For as, according to them, nothing exists but\nBrahman and the limiting adjuncts, Brahman--as being indivisible--must be\nundivided while entering into connexion with the upadhis, and hence itself\nundergoes a change into inferior forms. And if they say that it is only the\npower ( _s_ akti), not Brahman itself, which undergoes a change; this also is\nof no avail since Brahman and its power are non-different.\n\nOthers again (Yadavapraka _s_ a) hold that the general\n\np. 460\n\ncause, i.e. Brahman, is pure Being in which all distinctions and changes such\nas being an enjoying subject, and so on, have vanished, while however it is\nendowed with all possible potentialities. During a pralaya this causal\nsubstance abides self-luminous, with all the distinctions of consciousness of\npleasure and pain gone to rest, comparable to the soul of a man held by\ndreamless sleep, different however in nature from mere non-sentient matter.\nDuring the period of a creation, on the other hand, just as the substance\ncalled clay assumes the forms of jars, platters, and so on, or as the water of\nthe sea turns itself into foam, waves, bubbles, and so on, the universal\ncausal substance abides in the form of a triad of constituent parts, viz.\nenjoying subjects, objects of enjoyment, and a ruler. The attributes of being\na ruler, or an object of enjoyment, or an enjoying subject, and the\nperfections and imperfections depending on those attributes, are therefore\ndistributed in the same way as the attributes of being a jar or pitcher or\nplatter; and the different effects of these attributes are distributed among\ndifferent parts of the substance, clay. The objects of enjoyment, subjects of\nenjoyment, and the ruler are one, on the other hand, in so far as \'that which\nis\' constitutes their substance; just as jars, platters and pitchers are one\nin so far as their substance is constituted by clay. It is thus one substance\nonly, viz. \'that which is,\' that appears in different conditions, and it is in\nthis sense that the world is non-different from Brahman.--But this theory is\nreally in conflict with all Scripture, Sm _ri_ ti, Itihasa, Pura _n_ a and\nReasoning. For Scripture, Sm _ri_ ti, Itihasa and Pura _n_ a alike teach that\nthere is one supreme cause, viz. Brahman--a being that is the Lord of all\nLords, all-knowing, all-powerful, instantaneously realising all its purposes,\nfree of all blemish, not limited either by place or time, enjoying supreme\nunsurpassable bliss. Nor can it be held that above the Lord there is \'pure\nBeing\' of which the Lord is a part only. For \'This which is "being" only was\nin the beginning one only, without a second; it thought, may I be many, may I\ngrow forth\' ( _Kh._ Up. VI, 2, 3); \'Verily, in the beginning this was Brahman,\none only. Being one\n\np. 461\n\nit was not strong enough. It created the most excellent Kshattra, viz. those\nKshattras among the Devas--Indra, Varu _n_ a, Soma, Rudra, Par _g_ anya, Yama,\nM _ri_ tyu, i _s_ ana\' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 11); \'In the beginning all this was\nSelf, one only; there was nothing whatsoever else blinking. He thought, shall\nI send forth worlds\' (Ait. \xc3\x81r. II, 4, 1, 1, 2); \'There was in truth Naraya _n_\na only, not Brahma, not \xc3\x8e _s_ ana, nor heaven and earth, nor the nakshatras,\nnor the waters, nor Agni, nor Soma, nor Surya. Being alone he felt no delight.\nOf him merged in meditation\' &c. (Mahana. Up. I, 1)--these and other texts\nprove that the highest cause is the Lord of all Lords, Naraya _n_ a. For as\nthe terms \'Being,\' \'Brahman,\' \'Self,\' which are met with in sections treating\nof the same topic, are in one of those parallel sections particularised by the\nterm \'Naraya _n_ a,\' it follows that they all mean Naraya _n_ a. That the Lord\nonly is the universal cause is shown by the following text also, \'He the\nhighest great lord of lords, the highest deity of deities--he is the cause,\nthe lord of the lords of the organs, and there is of him neither parent nor\nlord\' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 7, 9). Similarly the Manu Sm _ri_ ti, \'Then the\ndivine Self-existent (Brahma)--desirous to produce from his own body beings of\nmany kind--first with a thought created the waters and placed his seed in\nthem\' (Ma. I, 6-8). Itihasas and Pura _n_ as also declare the Supreme Person\nonly to be the universal cause, \'Naraya _n_ a, of whom the world is the body,\nof infinite nature, eternal, when desirous to create sent forth from a\nthousandth part of himself the souls in two divisions.\' \'From Vish _n_ u the\nworld originated and in him it abides.\'\n\nNor is it possible to hold that the Lord is pure \'Being\' only, for such\n\'Being\' is admitted to be an element of the Lord; and moreover all \'Being\' has\ndifference. Nor can it be maintained that the Lord\'s connexion with all his\nauspicious qualities--knowledge, bliss, and so on--is occasional\n(adventitious) merely; it rather is essential and hence eternal. Nor may you\navail yourself of certain texts--viz. \'His high power ( _s_ akti) is revealed\nas manifold, as essential, and (so) his knowledge, strength and action\'\n\np. 462\n\n[paragraph continues] ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 8); \'He who is all-knowing, all-\ncognising\' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9), and others--to the end of proving that what is\nessential is only the Lord\'s connexion with the _potentialities_ ( _s_ akti)\nof knowledge, bliss, and so on. For in the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-text the word\n\'essential\' independently qualifies \'knowledge, strength, and action\' no less\nthan \' _s_ akti\'; and your explanation would necessitate so-called implication\n(laksha _n_ a). Nor again can it be said that in words such as sarv _g \xc3\xb1_a.\n(all-knowing), the formative suffix expresses potentiality only, as it\nadmittedly does in other words such as pa _k_ aka (cook); for grammar does not\nteach that all these (k _ri_ t) affixes in general express potentiality or\ncapability only. It rather teaches (cp. Pa _n_ ini III, 2, 54) that a few k\n_ri_ t-affixes only have this limited meaning; and in the case of pa _k_ aka\nand similar words we must assume capability to be denoted, because there is no\nother explanation open to us.--If, moreover, the Lord were held to be only a\npart of the Sat it would follow that the Sat, as the whole, would be superior\nto the Lord just as the ocean is superior to a wave, and this would be in\nconflict with ever so many scriptural texts which make statements about the\nLord, cp. e.g. \'Him the highest great lord of lords\'; \'There is none seen like\nto him or superior\' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 7, 8). If, moreover, mere Being is held\nto be the Self of all and the general whole, and the Lord only a particular\npart of it, this would imply the stultification of all those texts which\ndeclare the Lord to be the general Self and the whole of which all beings are\nparts; for jars and platters certainly cannot be held to be parts of, and to\nhave their being in, pitchers (which themselves are only special things made\nof clay). Against this you perhaps will plead that as Being in general is\nfully present in all its parts, and hence also in that part which is the Lord,\nall other things may be viewed as having their Self in and being parts of,\nhim.--But from your principles we might with equal right draw the inference\nthat as Being in general is fully present in the jar, the Lord is a part of\nthe jar and has his Self in that! From enunciations such as \'the jar is,\' \'the\ncloth is,\' it appears that Being\n\np. 463\n\nis an attribute of things, and cannot therefore be a substance and a cause. By\nthe \'being\' of a thing we understand the attribute of its being suitable for\nsome definite practical effect; while its \'non-being\' means its suitability\nfor an effect of an opposite nature.--Should it on the other hand be held that\nsubstances only have being, the (unacceptable) consequence would be that\nactions, and so on, are non-existent. And if (to avoid this consequence) it\nwere said that the being of actions, and so on, depends on their connexion\nwith substances, it would be difficult to show (what yet should be shown) that\n\'being\' is everywhere of one and the same nature. Moreover, if everything were\nnon-different in so far as \'being,\' there would be a universal consciousness\nof the nature of everything, and from this there would follow a general\nconfusion of all good and evil (i.e. every one would have conscious experience\nof everything) This point we have explained before. For all these reasons non-\ndifference can only have the meaning set forth by us.--Here the following\ndoubt may arise. In the case of childhood, youth, and so on, we observe that\ndifferent ideas and different terms are applied to different states of one and\nthe same being; in the case of clay, wood, gold, &c., on the other hand, we\nobserve that different ideas and terms are applied to different things. On\nwhat ground then do you determine that in the case of causes and effects, such\nas e.g. clay and jars, it is mere difference of state on which the difference\nof ideas and terms is based?--To this question the next Sutra gives a reply.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[434:1](sbe48185.htm#fr_36) In other words--is the golden ornament originated\nby the mere formless substance, gold; or by the form belonging to that special\npiece of gold (a coin, a bar, &c.), out of which the ornament is fashioned; or\nby the substance, gold, in so far as possessing that special form? The ru _k_\naka of the text has to be taken in the sense of nishka.\n\n[455:1](sbe48185.htm#fr_37) The meaning of the four words constituting the\nclause therefore would be, \'On account of speech (i.e. for the sake of the\naccomplishment of certain activities such as the bringing of water, which are\npreceded by speech), there is touched (by the previously mentioned substance\nclay) an effect and a name; i.e. for the sake of, &c., clay modifies itself\ninto an effect having a special name.\'The Commentary remarks that\' arambhanam\n\'cannot be taken in the sense of upadana; since, on the theory of the\nunreality of effects, the effect is originated not by speech but by thought\n(imagination) only; and on the pari _n_ ama doctrine the effect is likewise\nnot originated by speech but by Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 16.
