(numbers CLXXII and following of\nthe Catalogue) of a G _ri_ hya-sutra hitherto unpublished, which is ascribed\nto Khadira _k_ arya. It belongs to the Drahyaya _n_ a school of the Sama-veda,\nwhich prevails in the south of the Indian peninsula 1, and it is based on the\nGobhiliya-sutra, from which it has taken the greater number of its aphorisms,\njust as the Drahyaya _n_ a- _S_ rauta-sutra, as far as we can judge at\npresent, is nothing but a slightly altered redaction of La _t_ yayana 2. Like\nthe Gobhila-G _ri_ hya it very seldom gives the Mantras in their full extent,\nbut quotes them only with their Pratikas, and it is easy to identify these\nquotations in the Mantrabrahma _n_ a (published at Calcutta, 1873), which\ncontains the texts prescribed by Gobhila for the G _ri_ hya ceremonies.\n\nThe Khadira-G _ri_ hya has evidently been composed with the intention of\nabridging Gobhila's very detailed and somewhat lengthy treatise on the\ndomestic rites. Digressions, such as, for instance, that introduced by the\nwords tatraihad ahu _h_ , Gobhila I, 2, 10-27, or such as Gobhila's\nexplication of the terms paur _n_ amasi and amavasya, I, 5, 7 seqq., or most\nof the regulations concerning the _S_ akvaryas, III, 3, or the _S_ lokas, IV,\n7, are invariably left\n\np. 372\n\nout, and in the descriptions of the single ceremonies throughout the principal\npoints only are given, with the omission of all words and of all matter that\nit seemed possible to dispense with. On the other hand, the arrangement of the\nSutras has undergone frequent changes, in which the compiler clearly shows his\nintention of grouping together, more carefully than was done in the original\ntext, the Sutras which naturally belong to each other. Of the Sutras of the\nKhadira-G _ri_ hya which cannot be identified in Gobhila, several are to be\ntraced back to La _t_ yayana, or we should perhaps rather say, to Drahyaya _n_\na. Thus Khad. I, 1, 14 mantrantam avyakta _m_ parasyadigraha _n_ ena vidyat\nevidently corresponds to La _t_ yayana I, 1, 3, uttaradi _h_ purvantalaksha\n_n_ am, and Khad. I, 1, 24 avyav _ri_ tti _m_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\xe1\xb9\x85gair avya _v_ aya\n_m_ _k_ e _kh_ et is identical with La _t_ y. I, 2, 15, avyavayo\xe0\xa4\xbdvyav _ri_ tti\n_s_ _k_ a yag _\xc3\xb1_ a\xe1\xb9\x85gai _h_.\n\nUpon the whole, though certainly the Khadira-G _ri_ hya does not contain much\nmatter which is not known to us from other sources, it notwithstanding\npossesses a certain interest, since it shows by a very clear example how a\nSutrakara of the later time would remodel the work of a more ancient author,\ntrying to surpass him by a more correct arrangement, and especially by what\nbecame more and more appreciated as the chief accomplishment of Sutra\ncomposition, the greatest possible succinctness and economising of words. To\nan interpreter of Gobhila the comparison of the Khadira-G _ri_ hya no doubt\nwill suggest in many instances a more correct understanding of his text than\nhe would have been likely to arrive at without that aid, and perhaps even\nreadings of Gobhila which seemed hitherto subject to no doubt, will have to\ngive way to readings supplied by the Grantha MSS. of the Khadira-G _ri_ hya.\nThus, Gobhila III, 8, 16, I do not hesitate to correct asa _m_ svadam, on the\nauthority of Khad. III, 3, 13, into asa _m_ khadam or asa _m_ khadan 1.\n\np. 373\n\nAs the text of the Khadira-G _ri_ hya is very short and has not yet been\npublished, it has been printed at the foot of the page, together with\nreferences to the parallel passages of Gobhila. For further explanations of\nthe single Sutras, I refer to my translation of Gobhila which will form part\nof the second volume of the G _ri_ hya-sutras, where I shall also hope to give\nsome extracts from Rudraskanda's commentary on the Khadira-G _ri_ hya.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[371:1](sbe29207.htm#fr_963) See Dr. Burnell's Catalogue, p. 56.\n\n[371:2](sbe29207.htm#fr_964) Weber, Vorlesungen uber indische\nLiteraturgeschichte (2nd edition), p. 87: 'Almost the entire difference\nbetween this Sutra and that of La _t_ yayana lies in the arrangement of the\nmatter treated of, which is in itself very nearly the same in both texts, and\nis expressed in the same words.'
