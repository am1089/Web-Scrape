How may we unanimously offer mighty light [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:1:1) to\nbountiful Agni Vai _s_ vanara? With his mighty perfect growth he supports the\nhigh bank [2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:1:2) like a pillar.\n\n2\\. Do not reproach Him, the self-dependent one, who has given this bounty to\nme, the god to the mortal, the clever one to the simple, the wise immortal,\nthe most manly, restless[1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:2:1) Agni Vai _s_ vanara.\n\n3\\. Agni, the sharp-pointed, the mighty bull with thousandfold sperm, has\nproclaimed to me the great, doubly-powerful [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:3:1)\nSaman, the prayer, having found, as it were, the hidden track of a cow\n[2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:3:2).\n\n4\\. May Agni, he who is rich in wealth, whose teeth are sharp, consume with\nhis hottest flames those who violate the laws founded by Varu _n_ a, the\nbeloved, firm (laws) of attentive Mitra.\n\n5 [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:5:1). They who roam about like brotherless girls\n[2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:5:2), of evil conduct like women who deceive their\nhusbands, being wicked, sinful, and untrue--they have created for themselves\nthis deep place [3](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:5:3).\n\n6\\. On me, however small, but innocent, thou, O purifying Agni, hast fiercely\nplaced this mighty, deep, vigorous prayer, like a heavy burden, this P _ri_ sh\n_th_ a [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:6:1), consisting of seven elements\n[2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:6:2).\n\n7\\. Let our prayer which purifies Him, through the power of mind (inherent in\nit), reach Him who is the common (property of all men) alike, the good (name?)\nof P _ri_ _s_ ni on the skin of the herbs, on the summit of the \xe2\x80\xa6\n[1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:7:1).\n\np. 336\n\n8\\. What should be openly uttered by me of this speech? They secretly speak of\nthat which is hidden [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:8:1). When they have uncovered,\nas it were, the water of the cows [2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:8:2), he guards the\nbeloved summit of the \xe2\x80\xa6 [3](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:8:3), the footstep of the bird\n[4](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:8:4).\n\n9\\. He has found in secret that great face of the great ones which the bright\ncow accompanied [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:9:1), the ancient (face) shining in\nthe abode of _Ri_ ta, the quickly running, quickly moving.\n\n10\\. And resplendent near his parents (Heaven and Earth), in their presence,\nhe thought of the secret, good (name?) of P _ri_ _s_ ni. The tongue of the\nmanly, forward-bent flame (seized) that which was near at hand in the highest\nabode of the mother, the cow [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:10:1).\n\n11\\. I speak, when being asked, _Ri_ ta (i. e. truth), out of reverence (for\nAgni, or for the gods), out of hope [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:11:1) placed in\nthee, O _G_ atavedas, as I am here [2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:11:2). Thou rulest\nover all this wealth whatever (dwells) in heaven and earth.\n\n12\\. Which of this wealth is ours, what treasure? Mayst thou who knowest it\ndeclare to us (that treasure), O _G_ atavedas! What is the highest (aim) of\nthis our way, is hidden. We have not come scolding to an empty (?)\n[1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:12:1) place.\n\n13 [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:13:1). What is the limit, what the objects? What\npleasant (wealth) may we obtain as swift (horses gain) the prize? When will\nthe Dawns, the divine consorts of the immortal, expand over us with the sun's\nsplendour?\n\n14\\. And what do those insatiable ones here say, O Agni, with their sapless,\nfeeble, weak speech that has to be listened to? Let them unarmed fall into\nnothingness.\n\np. 337\n\n15\\. The face of this kindled, manly Vasu has shone gloriously in the house.\nClothed in brilliancy, with his shape beautiful to behold, the bountiful has\nshone like a house [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:15:1) with its wealth.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe hymn is addressed to Vai _s_ vanara. The same _Ri_ shi and metre.--No\nverse occurs in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Cf. especially I, 45, 8 (above, [p. 42](sbe46011.htm#page_42)). b _ri_\nhat bha\xc2\xb4 _h_ bibhrata _h_ havi _h_.\n\nNote 2. Cf. vol. xxxii, p. 93 (I, 38, 11, note 2).\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. See above, I, 36, 1, note 2.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Dvibarha _h_ is neuter. See Lanman, p. 560; Joh. Schmidt,\nPluralbildungen der Indogermanischen Neutra, p. 132.\n\nNote 2. Agni has discovered the Saman which he proclaims to the mortal, like\nthe track of a lost cow.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. See H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 539.\n\nNote 2. Abhratara _h_ cannot be accusative plural fem., as Zimmer\n(Altindisches Leben, p. 419) seems to take it. The correct interpretation has\nbeen given by Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, p. 299.\n\nNote 3. I. e. hell.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. In the younger Vedic ritual certain Stotras are technically designated\nas p _ri_ sh _th_ a or 'backs' of the liturgies\n\np. 338\n\n[paragraph continues] (see, for instance, Weber, Indische Studien, X, 385).\nDoes the word stand here in the same sense? Or should we correct presh _th_\nam?\n\nNote 2. The seven tones of the scale?\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. This passage is obscure. The text runs thus: sasasya _k_ arman adhi\n_k_ a\xc2\xb4ru p _r i_sne _h_ agre rupa _h_ arupitam (a\xc2\xb4rupitam Sa _m_ hitapa _th_\na) _g_ abaru. As to the first words, see III, 5, 6. To _k_ a\xc2\xb4ru possibly a\nnoun like na\xc2\xb4ma should be supplied (cf. below, verse 10). The last Pada (cf.\nabove, III, 5, 5, note 1) is simply untranslateable.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Of the milk alluded to in the third Pada?--On ni _n_ ik, cf. Lanman,\np. 436; Job. Schmidt, Pluralbildungen der Indogerm. Neutra, p, 397.\n\nNote 2. The water of the cows is the milk, cf. X, 12, 3. Roth (Zeitschr. der\nD. Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 682): als sie den Schatz der Kuhe entdeckt\nhatten (var iva = varam iva).\n\nNote 3. Rupa _h_ agram.\n\nNote 4. Comp above, III, 5, 5 with note 1; III, 5, 6, note 2.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The sun, the face of the great gods (cf. I, 115, 1), accompanied by\nthe dawn?\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Is the meaning of all this that Agni, shining on the altar between\nheaven and earth, desires, and consumes with his flames, the oblation of\nbutter which has its home in the udder of the cow?\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. On a _s_ asa, see Lanman, p. 492 seq.; Bartholomae Indogermanische\nForschungen, I, 182 seq.; Bechtel, Hauptprobleme\n\np. 339\n\nder Indogerm. Lautlehre, p. 262. This noun is not to be derived from the root\n_s_ as, but from _s_ a _m_ s.\n\nNote 2. Compare I, 79, 2 (with note 3).\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. Comp. X, 108, 7, where the Pa _n_ is say to Sarama: reku padam alakam\na\xc2\xb4 _g_ agantha ('the place is empty (?); thou hast come in vain').\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. This verse has been treated of by Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 306.\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. On this comparison, see Hirzel, Gleichnisse und Metaphern im Rigveda,\np. 102 seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 6](sbe46095.htm)\n\n"
