(Him who meditates on) the effected Brahman, (thus opines) Badari; because\nfor him going is possible.\n\nThe following question now presents itself for consideration. Does the troop\nof conducting divinities, Agni and the rest, lead on those who meditate on the\neffected Brahman, i.e. Hira _n_ yagarbha; or those only who meditate on the\nhighest Brahman; or those who meditate on the highest Brahman and those who\nmeditate on the individual Self as having Brahman for its Self?--The teacher\nBadari is of opinion that the divinities lead on those only who meditate on\nthe effected Brahman. For he only who meditates on Hira _n_ yagarbha can move;\nwhile a person meditating on the highest Brahman which is absolutely complete,\nall-knowing, present everywhere, the Self of all, cannot possibly be conceived\nas moving to some other place in order to reach Brahman; for him Brahman\nrather is something already reached. For him the effect of true knowledge is\nonly to put an end to that Nescience which has for its object Brahman, which,\nin reality, is eternally reached. He, on the other hand,who meditates on Hira\n_n_ yagarbha may be conceived as moving in ordfer to reach his object, which\nis something abiding within a special limited place. It is he therefore who is\nconducted on by Agni and the other escorting deities.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7. And on account of Brahman being specified](sbe48543.htm)\n\n'
