The upward rays of the sun are the honey cells above. The secret doctrines\nare the bees, Brahman (the Om) is the flower, the water is the nectar.\n\n2\\. Those secret doctrines (as bees) brooded over Brahman (the Om); and from\nit, thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame, glory of\ncountenance, brightness, vigour, strength, and health.\n\n3\\. That flowed forth, and went towards the sun. And that forms what seems to\nstir in the centre of the sun.\n\n4\\. These (the different colours in the sun) are the essences of the essences.\nFor the Vedas are essences (the best things in the world); and of them (after\nthey have assumed the form of sacrifice) these (the colours rising to the sun)\nare again the essences. They are the nectar of the nectar. For the Vedas are\nnectar (immortal), and of them these are the nectar.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 6](sbe01064.htm)\n\n'
