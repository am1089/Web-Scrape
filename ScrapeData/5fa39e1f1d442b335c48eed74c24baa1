 \n\np. 126  \n\nVrihaspati looks down benign,  \nAnd the moon rests in Pushya's sign,  \nAs Brahmans sage this day declare:  \nThen whence, my lord, this grief and care?  \nWhy does no canopy, like foam  \nFor its white beauty, shade thee home,  \nIts hundred ribs spread wide to throw  \nSplendour on thy fair head below?  \nWhere are the royal fans, to grace  \nThe lotus beauty of thy face,  \nFair as the moon or wild-swan's wing,  \nAnd waving round the new-made king?  \nWhy do no sweet-toned bards rejoice  \nTo hail thee with triumphant voice?  \nNo tuneful heralds love to raise  \nLoud music in their monarch's praise?  \nWhy do no Brahmans, Scripture-read,  \nPour curds and honey on thy head,  \nAnointed, as the laws ordain,  \nWith holy rites, supreme to reign?  \nWhere are the chiefs of every guild?  \nWhere are the myriads should have filled  \nThe streets, and followed home their king  \nWith merry noise and triumphing?  \nWhy does no gold-wrought chariot lead  \nWith four brave horses, best for speed?  \nNo elephant precede the crowd  \nLike a huge hill or thunder cloud,  \nMarked from his birth for happy fate,  \nWhom signs auspicious decorate?  \nWhy does no henchman, young and fair,  \nPrecede thee, and delight to bear  \nEntrusted to his reverent hold  \nThe burthen of thy throne of gold?  \nWhy, if the consecrating rite  \nBe ready, why this mournful plight?  \nWhy do I see this sudden change,  \nThis altered mien so sad and strange?'  \n\nTo her, as thus she weeping cried,  \nRaghu's illustrious son replied:  \n\n'Sita, my honoured sire's decree  \nCommands me to the woods to flee.  \nO high-born lady, nobly bred  \nIn the good paths thy footsteps tread,  \nHear, Janak's daughter, while I tell  \nThe story as it all befell.  \nOf old my father true and brave  \nTwo boons to Queen Kaikeyi gave.  \nThrough these the preparations made  \nFor me today by her are stayed,  \nFor he is bound to disallow  \nThis promise by that earlier vow.  \nIn Dandak forest wild and vast  \nMust fourteen years by me be passed.  \nMy father's will makes Bharat heir,  \nThe kingdom and the throne to share.  \nNow, ere the lonely wild I seek,  \nI come once more with thee to speak.  \nIn Bharat's presence, O my dame,  \nNe'er speak with pride of Rama's name:  \nAnother's eulogy to hear  \nIs hateful to a monarch's ear.  \nThou must with love his rule obey  \nTo whom my father yields the sway.  \nWith love and sweet observance learn  \nHis grace, and more the king's, to earn.  \nNow, that my father may not break  \nThe words of promise that he spake,  \nTo the drear wood my steps are bent:  \nBe firm, good Sita, and content.  \nThrough all that time, my blameless spouse,  \nKeep well thy fasts and holy vows,  \nRise from thy bed at break of day,  \nAnd to the Gods due worship pay.  \nWith meek and lowly love revere  \nThe lord of men, my father dear,  \nAnd reverence to Kaus'alya show,  \nMy mother, worn with eld and woe:  \nBy duty's law, O best of dames,  \nHigh worship from thy love she claims,  \nNor to the other queens refuse  \nObservance, rendering each her dues:  \nBy love and fond attention shown  \nThey are my mothers like mine own.  \nLet Bharat and S'atrughna bear  \nIn thy sweet love a special share:  \nDear as my life, O let them be  \nLike brother and like son to thee.  \nIn every word and deed refrain  \nFrom aught that Bharat's soul may pain:  \nHe is Ayodhya's king and mine,  \nThe head and lord of all our line.  \nFor those who serve and love them much  \nWith weariless endeavour, touch  \nAnd win the gracious hearts of kings.  \nWhile wrath from disobedience springs.  \nGreat monarchs from their presence send  \nTheir lawful sons who still offend,  \nAnd welcome to the vacant place  \nGood children of an alien race.  \nThen, best of women, rest thou here,  \nAnd Bharat's will with love revere.  \nObedient to thy king remain,  \nAnd still thy vows of truth maintain.  \n   To the wide wood my steps I bend:  \n      Make thou thy dwelling here;  \n   See that thy conduct ne'er offend,  \n      And keep my words, my dear.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXVII.: Sita's Speech.](ry105.htm)\n\n"
