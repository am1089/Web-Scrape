Next let a man meditate on the sevenfold Saman which is uniform in itself\n1 and leads beyond death. The word hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara has three syllables, the word\nprastava has three syllables: that is equal (sama).\n\n2\\. The word adi (first, Om) has two syllables, the word pratihara has four\nsyllables. Taking one syllable from that over, that is equal (sama).\n\n3\\. The word udgitha has three syllables, the word upadrava has four\nsyllables. With three and three syllables it should be equal. One syllable\nbeing left over, it becomes trisyllabic. Hence it is equal.\n\n4\\. The word nidhana has three syllables, therefore it is equal. These make\ntwenty-two syllables.\n\n5\\. With twenty-one syllables a man reaches the sun (and death), for the sun\nis the twenty-first 2 from here; with the twenty-second he conquers what is\nbeyond the sun: that is blessedness, that is freedom from grief\n\n6\\. He obtains here the victory over the sun (death), and there is a higher\nvictory than the victory over the sun for him, who knowing this meditates on\nthe sevenfold Saman as uniform in itself, which leads beyond death, yea, which\nleads beyond death.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[28:1](sbe01044.htm#fr_138) \xc3\x82tmasammita is explained by the commentator either\nas having the same number of syllables in the names of the different Samans,\nor as equal to the Highest Self.\n\n[28:2](sbe01044.htm#fr_139) There are twelve months, five seasons, three\nworlds, then follows the sun as the twenty-first.
