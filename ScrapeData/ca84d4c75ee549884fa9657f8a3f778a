He then takes a lump of clay, as much as he thinks sufficient for\nthe bottom part, with, 'Makha's head thou art!'--Makha, doubtless, is the\nsacrifice, and this is its head; for the \xc3\x82havaniya fire is the head of the\nsacrifice, and that \xc3\x82havaniya (fire-altar) he is now about to build: hence he\nsays, 'Makha's head thou art!'\n\n6:5:2:22\\. And, again, as to why he says, 'Makha's head thou art!'--when he\n(Agni) is built up, then he is born, and it is by the head (issuing first), by\nthe top, that he who is born is born: 'when he is born, may he be born by the\nhead, by the top!' so he thinks.\n\n6:5:2:33\\. He spreads it out, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 58), 'May the Vasus,\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, fashion thee by the Gayatri metre!'--for the bottom part is this\n(terrestrial) world, and this the Vasus fashioned by means of the Gayatri\nmetre; and in like manner does this one now fashion it by means of the Gayatri\nmetre;--'A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like,' he says, for A\xe1\xb9\x85giras is the breath. 'Thou art\nsteadfast!'--that is, 'thou art firm,' or, 'thou art fixed;'--'Thou art the\nearth!'--for this bottom part is indeed the earth;--'Establish in me\noffspring, increase of wealth, lordship of cattle, manhood, clansmen for the\nSacrificer!' For the Vasus, having fashioned this (terrestrial) world, invoked\nthis blessing thereon; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, having\nfashioned this world, now invoke this blessing thereon. Having made it of the\nmeasure of a span (in each direction), he then turns up its edge on each side.\n\n6:5:2:44\\. He then lays thereon the first (lower) side-part,\n\np. 234\n\nwith, 'May the Rudras, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, fashion thee by the Trish _t_ ubh metre!'\n--for this side-part is the air, and this the Rudras fashioned by means of the\nTrish _t_ ubh metre; and in like manner does this one now fashion it by means\nof the Trish _t_ ubh metre;--'A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like,' he says, for A\xe1\xb9\x85giras is the\nbreath;--'Thou art steadfast!'--that is, 'thou art firm,' or 'thou art\nfixed;'--'Thou art the air!' for this side-part is indeed the air;--'Establish\nin me offspring, increase of wealth, lordship of cattle, manhood, clansmen for\nthe Sacrificer!' For the Rudras, having fashioned the air, invoked this\nblessing thereon; and in like manner does this Sacrificer, having fashioned\nthe air, now invoke this blessing thereon. Having stroked and smoothed it all\nover--\n\n6:5:2:55\\. He lays on the upper side-part, with, 'May the \xc3\x82dityas, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-\nlike, fashion thee by the _G_ agati metre!' for this side-part is yonder sky,\nand this the \xc3\x82dityas fashioned by means of the _G_ agati metre; and in like\nmanner does this one now fashion it by means of the _G_ agati\nmetre;--'A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like,' he says, for A\xe1\xb9\x85giras is the breath;--'Thou art\nsteadfast!'--that is, 'thou art firm,' or 'thou art fixed;'--'Thou art the\nsky!' for that side-part is indeed the sky;--'Establish in me offspring,\nincrease of wealth, lordship of cattle, manhood, clansmen for the Sacrificer!'\nFor the \xc3\x82dityas, having fashioned the sky, invoked this blessing thereon; and\nin like manner the Sacrificer, having fashioned the sky, now invokes this\nblessing thereon.\n\n6:5:2:66\\. He then makes it (complete), with this fourth prayer, 'May the All-\ngods, the friends of all\n\np. 235\n\nmen, fashion thee, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, by the Anush _t_ ubh metre!'--this prayer,\ndoubtless, is the (four) quarters, and the All-gods, the friends of all men,\ndid then, by means of this prayer, put the quarters into these worlds, (that\nis) into the fire-pan; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by means of\nthis prayer, now put the quarters into these worlds, into the fire-\npan;--'A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like,' he says, because A\xe1\xb9\x85giras is the breath;--'Thou art\nsteadfast!'--that is, 'thou art firm,' or 'thou art fixed;'--'Thou art the\nquarters!' for this prayer indeed is the quarters;--'Establish in me\noffspring, increase of wealth, lordship of cattle, manhood, clansmen for the\nSacrificer!' For the All-gods, the friends of all men, having fashioned the\nquarters, invoked this blessing on them; and in like manner the Sacrificer,\nhaving fashioned the quarters, now invokes this blessing on them.\n\n6:5:2:77\\. With that same formula he fashions it both inside and outside,\nwhence the quarters are both inside and outside these worlds. He therewith\nfashions it without restriction (to any part of the pan), for unrestricted are\nthe quarters.\n\n6:5:2:88\\. He makes it just a span high, and a span sideways; for Vish _n_ u,\nwhen an embryo, was a span long, and this (fire-pan) is the womb: he thus\nmakes the womb of equal size with the embryo 1.\n\n6:5:2:99\\. Were it larger than a span, he would make it smaller by that\nprayer; and were it smaller, (he would make it) larger thereby 2.\n\np. 236\n\n6:5:2:1010\\. If there be one victim, let him make it (the pan) one span wide;\nand if there be five victims, let him make it five spans wide, or an arrow's\nwidth; for the arrow means strength: he thus makes it to be composed of\nstrength. But, indeed, an arrow formerly used to be five spans long 1.\n\n6:5:2:1111\\. He then lays round the horizontal belt (or rim);--that is the\nquarters; for the gods, having made these worlds, the fire-pan, strengthened\nand encircled them by the quarters; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having\nmade these worlds, the fire-pan, thus strengthens and encircles them by the\nquarters.\n\n6:5:2:1212\\. He lays this (rim) on the upper third (of the side), for it is\nthere the ends of these worlds meet, and he thus makes them firm thereby.\n\n6:5:2:1313\\. [He does so, with Va _g_. S. XI, 59] 'Thou art Aditi's girdle!'--\nin the sacrifice the string relates to Varu _n_ a: he thus lays this belt\nround after (expressly) making it one not relating to Varu _n_ a.\n\n6:5:2:1414\\. He then silently makes four upright (bands), for these are the\nquarters;--for the gods, having made these worlds, the fire-pan, made them\nfirm on all sides by means of the quarters 2; and in like manner the\nSacrificer, having made these worlds, the fire-pan, now makes them firm on all\nsides by means of the quarters.\n\n6:5:2:1515\\. These (vertical bands) run up to (the rim of) it, for they did\nthen support it, and so do they now support it: thus that upper part of it\nbecomes firm\n\np. 237\n\nby means of the horizontal belt, and that lower part of it by means of these\n(vertical bands).\n\n6:5:2:1616\\. At their tops they form nipples; for the gods, having made these\nworlds, the fire-pan, drew forth for themselves from these nipples all\n(objects of) their desires; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having made\nthese worlds, the fire-pan, draws forth from these nipples all his desires.\n\n6:5:2:1717\\. This (fire-pan) indeed is a cow, for the fire-pan is these\nworlds, and these worlds are a cow: that horizontal belt is its udder; it is\nin the (upper) third of it, for the udder is in one-third of the cow.\n\n6:5:2:1818\\. He forms nipples to it, whereby he forms the nipples of the\nudder: it has four nipples, for the cow has four nipples.\n\n6:5:2:1919\\. Some, indeed, make it with two nipples, or also with eight\nnipples; but let him not do so, for those cattle which have fewer nipples than\na cow, and those which have more nipples, are less fit to yield him a\nlivelihood: hence they make this (fire-pan) less fit to yield a livelihood;\nand, indeed, they do not make it (like) a cow, but (like) a bitch, or a ewe,\nor a mare; hence let him not do so.\n\n6:5:2:2020\\. He then takes hold of its bowl, with, 'May Aditi seize thy bowl!'\nAditi, doubtless, is Speech; and the gods, having then fashioned it, perfected\nit by means of Aditi, speech; and in like manner this one, having fashioned\nit, now perfects it by means of Aditi, speech.\n\n6:5:2:2121\\. Having grasped it with both hands, he sets it down, with, 'She,\nhaving fashioned the great (mahim) fire-pan,'--that is, 'she, having fashioned\nthe great (mahatim) fire-pan;'--'the earthen womb for Agni;'--for this is\nindeed Agni's\n\np. 238\n\nearthen womb;--'Aditi offered it unto her sons, thinking, They shall bake it!'\n--for Aditi, indeed, having fashioned it, offered it to the gods, her sons, to\nbake it; and in like manner does this one now, after fashioning it, offer it\nto the gods to bake it.\n\n6:5:2:2222\\. Now some make three (fire-pans), saying, 'Three (in number) are\nthese worlds, and the fire-pans are these worlds;' and also for mutual\nexpiation, thinking, 'If the one will break, we shall carry (Agni) in the\nother, and if the other (breaks), then in the other (or third).' Let him not\ndo so; for that first bottom part is this world; and that first (lower) side-\npart is the air; and the upper one is the sky; and that fourth, the prayer,\ndoubtless is the quarters; and just as much as these worlds and the quarters\nare, so much is this whole (universe). But were he to add anything thereto, he\nwould make it to be redundant, and whatever redundant (act) is done in the\nsacrifice is left over for the Sacrificer's spiteful rival. And as to the\nexpiation in case of the (fire-pan being) broken, that (will be told) in a\nsubsequent chapter 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[235:1](sbe4142.htm#fr_467) Vish _n_ u is identical with Agni, inasmuch as\nboth are the sacrifice.\n\n[235:2](sbe4142.htm#fr_468) That is to say, if the pan, thus fashioned, is not\nquite of the exact measure, the formula is supposed to set this right.\n\n[236:1](sbe4142.htm#fr_469) Yasmin kale dhanurvedanusare _n_ a dharmata _h_\nkshatriya yudhyante tasmin kale pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ aprade _s_ eshur asit, adhuna tv\niyam aniyataparima _n_ a vartante, Say.\n\n[236:2](sbe4142.htm#fr_470) Viz. by means of the mountains, according to Saya\n_n_ a.\n\n[238:1](sbe4142.htm#fr_471) [VI, 6, 4, 8](sbe4148.htm#6:6:4:8).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 5, 3.
