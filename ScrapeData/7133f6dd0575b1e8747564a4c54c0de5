SEXUAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES IN YOGA\n\nIn the Vedic and Upanishad periods of Yoga, total abstinence from sexual\nintercourse ( _brahmacarya_ ), whether by action, mind or word was considered\nto be one of the highest virtues leading to Yoga. Later exponents of Yoga,\nhowever, interpreted the injunction toward a continent life to mean that one\nshould maintain a dispassionate attitude toward sexual matters, and that there\nshould be purity in sex. Some of the earlier Yogins stated that Yoga is mainly\nfor the householder. The sage Swatmarama said that anyone can hope to achieve\ncomplete success in Yoga, even while living a wayward life, if he or she\nfollowed Yoga practice of sex hygiene. This is a practice for the cleanliness\nand preservation of the generative organs and the preservation of virility.\nSome of the older manuscripts state that a man may be considered celibate in\nthe Yoga sense if he observes hygienic sex relations within the marriage\nbonds. In one of the tracts, it is stated that even a prostitute can attain\nthe highest object of life by following Yoga.\n\nOne of the problems that may be encountered in the practice of Yoga is that it\nmay build up in the adherent such powerful sexual strength that it will be\nnecessary to\n\np. 86\n\nsublimate this drive. The manuals of Hatha Yoga suggest: (1) Observance of\ncertain practices which influence the activity of the urogenital organs; (2)\ncool baths; (3) irrigation of the genital passages; and (4) active continence.\n\n#### The Useful Processes\n\nThe _bandhas_ and _mudras_ discussed earlier are said to have a powerful\neffect on sexual potency. One _asana_ of particular value in this respect is\ncalled _Asvinimudra_. In this, an attempt is made to simulate the action of a\nmare after she has excreted the bowel contents. This _asana_ , or _mudra_ , is\nbest performed in a squatting position, or in any convenient posture which\nwill allow free movements of the anal muscles. While practicing this, with\nevery exhalation of the breath, contract the anus, concentrating on the anal\nsphincters and the broad ligaments of the perineum (which support the muscular\nfibers of the prostate and the erector muscles of the penis in the male and\nthe muscles of the urogenital region in the female). After a deep and\nprolonged contraction, inhale slowly and let these muscles relax completely.\n\nWhen this is practiced, it increases blood circulation, and through its\nwavelike contraction and expansion and full relaxation, provides an internal\nmassage to the deeper sex organs. It also gives tone to the reproductive\norgans, since it affects the finer sympathetic nerve endings. It is claimed\nthat even sexual debility may be overcome through lengthy and regular practice\nof this exercise. It is suggested that this exercise be practiced only in the\nevening before retiring, and for about two minutes at a time.\n\nA problem affecting many men is frequent nocturnal discharges. To alleviate\nthis, a pose known as Gorakasana\n\np. 87\n\nhas been found highly effective. Join the soles of the feet together in front\nof the genitals with the toes pointing outward. Now, move the body by lifting\nit slightly from the ground, placing your weight on the two extended hands.\nPlace your heels under the anus. Let the feet cover the seam of the perineum\nbreadthwise, and hide your legs from the knees down with your thighs. Keep\nyour hands pressed on your knees to cause a steady pull backward. Vary the\nstrength by pressure on your knees. This posture works on the connective\nmuscles of the groin and thigh, and indirectly stretches both the superficial\nand deeper urogenital muscles. It aids elasticity of the muscle fibers in this\narea, and correspondingly increases the circulation of blood.\n\n#### Harmful Sexual Habits\n\nIncomplete sexual acts, such as unsatisfied intercourse, self-abuse and often-\nrepeated sexual excitements without orgasm, cause congestion of the sexual\norgans because of sustained dilation of the numerous capillaries in this\nregion. There may also be harmful psychological effects. Under these abnormal\nconditions, the congested organs grow weaker for want of proper blood\ncirculation. Their functions ultimately become so impaired as to set in strong\nreactions which, on the slightest sexual irritation or suggestive situation,\ncause premature emissions. In consequence, the muscular response also becomes\npoor, with feeble erections in the male, and inactivity of the clitoris and\nfailure of the erectile tissues in the vaginal orifice to produce the\nnecessary gripping in the female.\n\nOther troublesome conditions in this area arise from inflammation of the inner\nsex organs. This congestion or inflammation\n\np. 88\n\nis accompanied by high tension, restricted motion, impaired circulation of\nblood and functional alterations which are more severe in women than in men.\nThese situations are generally relieved by practice of _Asvinimudra_ , which\nprovides for drainage of the blood and more equalized circulation. This\nposture may be accompanied by a period of resting after the exercise, with the\ngenital regions higher than the heart which, in turn, is followed by\nstretching exercises.\n\n#### Use of Cool Bath\n\nIn advice to both celibates and married men, the tracts recommend the use of a\ncool bath (about 65\xc2\xb0 F.) before retiring as a means of avoiding nocturnal\nemissions. Older persons and those with lowered vitality might find it more\neffective to use a slightly colder hip bath (about 55\xc2\xb0 F.), while keeping the\nfeet in a warm foot bath (about 100\xc2\xb0 F.). This will help maintain a favorable\ncirculation.\n\nThe irrigation of the sexual passages, described in detail in the Yoga tracts,\nmight be difficult and perhaps even dangerous for the novice. It is suggested\nthat a nurse or doctor be consulted for instruction in hygiene of the\nurogenital region.\n\n#### Active Continence\n\nOn the matter of continence, there is considerable difference of opinion even\namong the Yogic authorities. Some maintain that by disuse of the sex organs,\nthe sex-endocrine glands become functionally impaired. On the other hand,\ndiffering authorities hold that passive continence is compatible with health\nand, further, that the sex glands are like\n\np. 89\n\ntear glands and sweat glands and do not atrophy or become impaired with\ndisuse.\n\nThe traditional Yoga belief is that preservation of the internal sex fluids\nwithin the body has the greatest physiological value. It is also held that\npreservation of the seminal fluid contributes toward building a strong\nphysical and mental constitution through biochemical economy, as the emissions\ncontain large percentages of iron, phosphorus and calcium. Yogins also stated\nthat, under the stimulus of excitement, a much larger quantity of the fluid is\nproduced and secreted and, when reabsorbed, these extra fluids promote\ncorresponding activity of the lymphatics and become transformed into life-\nenergy.\n\nThe conditions necessary to fill the objective of conserving life-energy\nthrough the preservation and absorption of sexual fluids into the system are\nthe normal physiological contact of the sexes, and sufficient nutrition to\nallow the sex glands to secrete without loss. (A heavy milk diet is\nrecommended for this purpose.) In short, it is better to engage in sexual\nactivities when necessary. This will cause less strain and will expend less\nenergy than will be expended through the effects of self-denial and\nrepressions.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 12.
