The father throws his debts on the (son) and obtains immortality if he\nsees the face of a living son. 1\n\n2\\. It is declared in the Veda, \'Endless are the worlds of those who have\nsons; there is no place for the man who is destitute of male offspring.\' 2\n\n3\\. There is a curse (in the Veda), \'May our enemies be destitute of\noffspring.\' 3\n\n4\\. There is also (the following) passage of the Veda, \'May I obtain, O Agni,\nimmortality by offspring.\' 4\n\n5\\. \'Through a son he conquers the worlds, through a grandson he obtains\nimmortality, but through his son\'s grandson he gains the world of the sun.\' 5\n\n6\\. There is a dispute (among the wise; some say), The son belongs to the\nhusband of the wife;\' (and some say), \'The son belongs to the begetter.\' 6\n\n7\\. With respect to this (matter) they quote also on both sides verses like\nthe following:\n\n8\\. (Some say), \'If (one man\'s) bull were to beget a hundred calves on another\nman\'s cows, they would belong to the owner of the cows; in vain would the bull\nhave spent his strength.\' 8\n\np. 85\n\n9\\. (Others say), \'Carefully watch the procreation of your offspring, lest\nstrangers sow seed on your soil; in the next world the son belongs to the\nbegetter; (by carelessness) a husband makes (the possession of) offspring in\nvain.\' 9\n\n10\\. If amongst many brothers who are begotten by one father, one have a son,\nthey all have offspring through that son; thus says the Veda. 10\n\n11\\. If among many wives of one husband, one have a son, they all have\noffspring through that son; thus says the Veda. 11\n\n12\\. Twelve (kinds of) sons only are noticed by the ancients. 12\n\n13\\. The first (among these is the son) begotten by the husband himself on his\nlegally married wife. 13\n\n14\\. The second is the son of a wife (who is begotten) on failure of the\n(first) on a (wife or widow duly) authorised (thereto, by a kinsman). 14\n\n15\\. The third is an appointed daughter. 15\n\np. 86\n\n16\\. It is declared in the Veda, \'A maiden who has no brothers comes back to\nthe male ancestors (of her own family); returning she becomes their son.\' 16\n\n17\\. With reference to this (matter there is) a verse (to be spoken by the\nfather when appointing daughter), \'I shall give thee a brotherless damsel,\ndecked with ornaments; the son whom she may bear, shall be my son.\' 17\n\n18\\. The fourth is the son of a remarried woman. 18\n\n19\\. She is called remarried (punarbhu) who leaving the husband of her youth,\nand having lived with others, re-enters his family; 19\n\n20\\. And she is called remarried who leaving an impotent, outcast or mad\nhusband, or after the death of her husband takes another lord. 20\n\n21\\. The fifth is the son of an unmarried damsel. 21\n\n22\\. They declare that the son whom an unmarried damsel produces through lust\nin her father\'s house, is the son of his maternal grandfather. 22\n\np. 87\n\n23\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): If an unmarried daughter bear\na son begotten by a man of equal caste, the maternal grandfather has a son\nthrough him; he shall offer the funeral cake, and take the wealth (of his\ngrandfather).\'\n\n24\\. (A male child) secretly born in the house is the sixth. 24\n\n25\\. They declare that these (six) are heirs and kinsmen, preservers from a\ngreat danger. 25\n\n26\\. Now among those (sons) who are not heirs, but kinsmen, the first is he\nwho is received with a pregnant bride. 26\n\n27\\. (The son of a damsel) who is married pregnant (is called) a son received\nwith the bride (saho _dh_ a).\n\n28\\. The second is the adopted son,\n\n29\\. (He) whom his father and his mother give (in adoption). 29\n\n30\\. (The son) bought is the third.\n\n31\\. That is explained by (the story of) Suna _h_ _s_ epa.\n\n32\\. \'Hari _s_ _k_ andra, forsooth, was a king. He bought the son of A _g_\nigarta Sauyavasi. 32\n\n33\\. The fourth is (the son) self-given. 33\n\np. 88\n\n34\\. That is (likewise) explained by (the story of) Suna _h_ _s_ epa.\n\n35\\. \'Suna _h_ _s_ epa, forsooth, when tied to the sacrificial stake, praised\nthe gods; there the gods loosened his bonds. To him poke (each of) the\nofficiating priests, "He shall be my son." He did not agree to their (request.\nThen) they made him make (this) agreement, "He shall be the son of him whom he\nchooses." Vi _s_ vamitra was the Hot _ri_ priest at that (sacrifice). He\nbecame his son.\'\n\n36\\. The son cast off is the fifth. 36\n\n37\\. (He is called so) who, cast off by his father and his mother, is received\n(as a son).\n\n38\\. They declare that the son of a woman of the _S_ udra caste is the sixth.\nThese (six) are kinsmen, not heirs. 38\n\n39\\. Now they quote also (the following rule): \'These (last-mentioned) six\n(sons) shall take the heritage of him who has no heir belonging to the first-\nmentioned six (classes).\n\n40\\. Now (follow the rules regarding) the partition of the (paternal) estate\namong brothers: 40\n\n41\\. And (let it be delayed) until those (widows) who have no offspring, (but\nare supposed to be pregnant), bear sons. 41\n\n42\\. Let the eldest take a double share, 42\n\n43\\. And a tithe of the kine and horses.\n\np. 89\n\n44\\. The goats, the sheep, and the house belong to the youngest,\n\n45\\. Black iron, the utensils, and the furniture to the middlemost.\n\n46\\. Let the daughters divide the nuptial present of their mother. 46\n\n47\\. If a Brahma _n_ a has issue by wives belonging to the Brahma _n_ a,\nKshatriya, and Vai _s_ ya classes respectively, 47\n\n48\\. The son of the Brahma _n_ a wife shall receive three shares,\n\n49\\. The son of the Kshatriya wife two shares,\n\n50\\. The other (sons) shall inherit equal shares.\n\n51\\. And if one of the (brothers) has gained something by his own (effort), he\nshall receive a double share. 51\n\n52\\. But those who have entered a different order receive no share, 52\n\n53\\. Nor (those who are) eunuchs, madmen, or outcasts. 53\n\n54\\. Eunuchs and madmen (have a claim to) maintenance. 54\n\n55\\. The widow of a deceased person shall sleep 55\n\np. 90\n\non the ground during six months, practising religious vows and abstaining from\npungent condiments and salt.\n\n56\\. After the completion of six months she shall bathe, and offer a funeral\noblation to her husband. (Then) her father or her brother shall assemble the\nGurus who taught or sacrificed (for the deceased) and his relatives, and shall\nappoint her (to raise issue to her deceased husband). 56\n\n57\\. Let him not appoint a (widow who is) mad, ill-conducted, or diseased, 57\n\n58\\. Nor one who is very aged.\n\n59\\. Sixteen years (after maturity is the period for appointing a widow);\n\n60\\. Nor (shall an appointment be made) if the (male entitled to approach the\nwidow) is sickly.\n\n61\\. Let him approach (the widow) in the muhuarta sacred to. Pra _g_ apati,\n(behaving) like a husband, without (amorously) dallying with her, and without\nabusing or ill-treating her. 61\n\n62\\. Let her obtain (the expenses for) food, raiment, baths, and unguents from\n(the estate of) her former (husband).\n\n63\\. They declare that a son begotten on (a widow who has) not been (duly)\nappointed, belongs to the begetter. 63\n\np. 91\n\n64\\. If she was (appointed, the child belongs) to both the males connected\nwith the appointment. 64\n\n65\\. No appointment (shall be made) through a desire to obtain the estate. 65\n\n66\\. Some say, \'Or, one may appoint (a widow out of covetousness), after\nimposing a penance.\' 66\n\n67, A maiden who has attained puberty shall wait for three years. 67\n\n68\\. After three years (have passed), she may take a. husband of equal caste.\n\n69\\. Now they quote also (the following verses) But if through a father\'s\nnegligence a maiden is here given away after the suitable age has passed, she\nwho was waiting (for a husband) destroys him who gives her away, just as the\nfee which is paid too late to the teacher (destroys the pupil).\'\n\n70\\. \'Out of fear of the appearance of the menses let the father marry his\ndaughter while she still runs about naked. For if she stays (in the house)\nafter the age of puberty, sin falls on the father.\' 70\n\np. 92\n\n71\\. \'As often as the courses of a maiden, who is filled with desire, and\ndemanded in marriage by men of equal caste, recur, so often her father and her\nmother are guilty of (the crime of) slaying an embryo; that is a rule of the\nsacred law.\' 71\n\n72\\. \'If the betrothed of a maiden die after she has been promised to him\nverbally, and by (a libation of) water, but before she was married with (the\nrecitation of) sacred texts, she belongs to her father alone.\' 72\n\n73\\. \'If a damsel has been abducted by force, and not been wedded with sacred\ntexts, she may lawfully be given to another man; she is even like a maiden.\'\n\n74\\. \'If a damsel at the death of her husband had been merely wedded by (the\nrecitation of) sacred texts, and if the marriage had not been consummated, she\nmay be married again.\'\n\n75\\. The wife of an emigrant shall wait for five years. 75\n\n76\\. After five years (have passed), she may go (to seek) her husband.\n\n77\\. If for reasons connected with spiritual or with money matters she be\nunwilling to leave her home, she must act in the same manner as if (her\nhusband were) dead.\n\n78\\. In this manner a wife of the Brahma _n_ a caste who has issue (shall\nwait) five years, and one who has no issue, four years; a wife of the\nKshatriya caste who has issue, five years, and one who has no issue, three\nyears; a wife of the Vai _s_ ya caste who\n\np. 93\n\nhas issue, four years, and one who has no issue, two years; a wife of the _S_\nudra caste who has issue, three years, and one who has no issue, one year.\n\n79\\. After that among those who are united (with her husband) in interest, or\nby birth, or by the funeral cake, or by libations of water, or by descent from\nthe same family, each earlier named person is more venerable than the\nfollowing ones. 79\n\n80\\. But while a member of her family is living, she shall certainly not go to\na stranger.\n\n81\\. Let the Sapi _n_ _d_ as or the subsidiary sons divide the heritage of him\nwho has no heir of the first-mentioned six kinds. 81\n\n82\\. On failure of them the spiritual teacher and a pupil shall take the\ninheritance. 82\n\n83\\. On failure of those two the king inherits. 83\n\n84\\. But let the king not take (the estate) of a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n85\\. For the property of a Brahma _n_ a is a terrible poison.\n\n86\\. \'Poison they do not call the (worst) poison; the property of a Brahma _n_\na is said to be the (most destructive) poison. Poison destroys only one\nperson, but the property of a Brahma _n_ a (him who takes it) together with\nsons and grandsons.\'\n\np. 94\n\n87\\. He should give it to men who are well versed in the three Vedas. 87\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[84:1](sbe1420.htm#fr_486) **XVII**.

CCIII; Mitakshara I, 11, 3;\nVyavahara Mayukha IV, 4, 43. The curious fact that Vasish _th_ a here calls\nthe appointed daughter a son may perhaps be explained by a custom which,\nthough rarely practised, still occurs in Ka _s_ mir, and by which a\nbrotherless maiden is given a male name. A historical instance of this kind is\nmentioned in the Ra _g_ atara\xe1\xb9\x85gi _n_ i, where it is stated that Kalya _n_\nadevi, princess of Gau _d_ a and wife of king _G_ ayapi _d_ a, was called by\nher father Kalya _n_ amalla. When I collated this passage with the help of a\nKa _s_ mirian, I was told that a certain Brahma _n_ a, still living in _S_\nrinagar, had changed the p. 86 name of his only child, a daughter called Amri,\nto the corresponding masculine form, Amar _g_ u, in order to secure to himself\nthrough her the same spiritual benefits as if he had a son. It seems to me not\nimprobable that Vasish _th_ a\'s Sutra alludes to the same legal fiction, and\nthat he recommends in the first instance that the father is to make his\ndaughter a son by changing her name, and next to secure for himself her son,\nby the verse quoted Sutra 17.\n\n[86:16](sbe1420.htm#fr_500) Colebrooke V, Dig.
