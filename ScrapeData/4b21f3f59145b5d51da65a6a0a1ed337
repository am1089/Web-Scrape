The pearl and its shell as an amulet bestowing long life and\nprosperity.\n\n1\\. Born of the wind, the atmosphere, the lightning, and the light, may this\npearl shell, born of gold, protect us from straits!  \n2\\. With the shell which was born in the sea, at the head of bright\nsubstances, we slay the Rakshas and conquer the Atrins (devouring demons).  \n3\\. With the shell (we conquer) disease and poverty; with the shell, too, the\nSaanvas. The shell is our universal remedy; the pearl shall protect us from\nstraits!  \n4\\. Born in the heavens, born in the sea, brought on from the river (Sindhu),\nthis shell, born of gold, is our life-prolonging amulet.  \n5\\. The amulet, born from the sea, a sun, born from Vritra (the cloud), shall\non all sides protect us from the missiles of the gods and the Asuras!  \n6\\. Thou art one of the golden substances, thou art born from Soma (the moon).\nThou art sightly on the chariot, thou art brilliant on the quiver. [May it\nprolong our lives!]  \n7\\. The bone of the gods turned into pearl; that, animated, dwells in the\nwaters. That do I fasten upon thee unto life, lustre, strength, longevity,\nunto a life lasting a hundred autumns, May the (amulet) of pearl protect thee!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIX, 26.
