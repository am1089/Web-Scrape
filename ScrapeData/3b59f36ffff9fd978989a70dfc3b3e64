For\nthe teacher _G_ aimini is of opinion that those passages contain only a\nreference to the other stages of life, not an injunction (of them).--Why?--\nBecause they contain no words expressive of injunction such as imperative\nverbal forms, and because each of them is seen to have some other purport. In\nthe passage, 'There are three' &c., the text at first refers to three stages\nof life ('Sacrifice, study, and charity are the first' &c. &c.), thereupon\ndeclares them not to have unbounded results ('All these obtain the world of\nthe blessed'), and finally glorifies 'the state of being grounded on Brahman'\nas having unbounded results ('the Brahmasa _m_ stha obtains immortality').--\nBut is not a mere reference even sufficient to intimate the existence of those\nstages of life?--True; but they are established (enjoined) not by direct\nscriptural statements, but only by Sm _ri_ ti and custom, and therefore when\ncontradicted by direct scriptural statement 1 are either to be disregarded or\nelse to be viewed as concerning those who (for some reason or other) are\ndisqualified (for active worship, sacrifices and the like).--But together with\nthe stages demanding chastity the text refers to the condition of the\nhouseholder also  2. ('Sacrifice, study, and charity are the first.')--True;\nbut the existence of the state of the householder is established (not by that\npassage but) by other scriptural passages, viz. those which enjoin on the\nhouseholder certain works such as the Agnihotra. Hence the reference in the\npassage under discussion aims at glorification only, not at injunction.\n\np. 297\n\n[paragraph continues] Moreover, direct scriptural enunciations forbid other\nstages of life; cp. 'A murderer of the gods is he who removes the fire;'\n'After having brought to thy teacher his proper reward do not cut off the line\nof children' (Taitt. Up. I, 11, 1); 'To him who is without a son the world\ndoes not belong; all beasts even know that.'--Similarly the passages, 'Those\nwho in the forest practise faith and austerity' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 10, 1), and the\nanalogous passage (from the Mu _n_ _d_ aka), contain instruction not about the\nother stages of life but about the going on the path of the gods. And of\nclauses such as 'austerity is the second' it is doubtful whether they speak of\na stage of life at all. And a passage like 'Wishing for that world only\nmendicants wander forth,' does not enjoin the wandering forth but merely\nglorifies that world. But there is at any rate one scriptural text which\ndirectly and unambiguously enjoins the condition of life of the wandering\nmendicant, viz. the one of the _G_ abalas, 'Let him wander forth at once from\nthe state of studentship.'--True, but our discussion is carried on without\nreference to that passage.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[296:1](sbe38227.htm#fr_190) Such as that concerning the permanent obligation\nof the Agnihotra and so on.\n\n[296:2](sbe38227.htm#fr_191) And we therefore may conclude that those stages\nare as valid as the--notoriously valid--state of householdership.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 19](sbe38228.htm)\n\n"
