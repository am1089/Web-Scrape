Haradatta says\nthat the expression sa, \'such (a man),\' refers to the king, and to the Brahma\n_n_ a deeply versed in the Vedas, who have been described in the preceding\nchapter. My MSS. insert between this and the following one another Sutra,\nwhich has been left out in Professor Stenzler\'s edition. It seems to me that\nit is absolutely required, and I therefore insert it here, together with\nHaradatta\'s comment, according to my best copy, P.\n\nGautama: \'(And) a Snataka (i.e. a person who has completed his studentship,\nbut has not yet taken a wife, shall act thus).\' Haradatta: \'It must be\nunderstood that the word "and" has been left p. 219 out. (The meaning is):\n"And a Snataka shall obey the following ordinances." If this Sutra were not\ngiven, those ordinances would have to be obeyed after marriage only; and if\nthe preceding Sutra (1) had not been given, before marriage only, because the\nterm Snataka is usually employed in that (sense) only. For this reason both\n(Sutras) have been given. Hence, though a man may not enter another order, he\nshall, after taking the bath (on completion of his studentship), obey these\nordinances during his whole life. As here (Sutra 1) the word sa, "such a man,"\nis used, a Kshatriya and a Brahma _n_ a only must necessarily obey the rules\nprescribed for a Snataka and perform a penance for breaking them; and the\npenance for breaking the rules prescribed for a Snataka is fasting. This is\n(the object of the insertion of the word sa, "such (a man)." But, if a Vai _s_\nya follows them, (his reward will be) prosperity; if he breaks them, he need\nnot perform a penance. With respect to this matter another Sm _ri_ ti says:\n"The penance which is prescribed for a breach of the Snataka laws, must be\nperformed by a Kshatriya and a Brahma _n_ a alone, never by (men of) the other\n(caste)."\n\n[219:2](sbe0273.htm#fr_1032) Manu IV, 35.\n\n[219:3](sbe0273.htm#fr_1033)-4. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 30, 10-13.\n\n[219:5](sbe0273.htm#fr_1034) Manu IV, 66.\n\n[219:6](sbe0273.htm#fr_1035) According to Haradatta the same rule applies to\ngarlands and shoes.\n\n[219:7](sbe0273.htm#fr_1036) Manu IV, 35. \'The expression "his beard" includes\nby implication the nails and the rest. . . . . As he says "without a\nsufficient reason," he shall allow his beard to grow during the pregnancy of\nhis wife and on other occasions. With respect to this matter they quote the\nfollowing verse: "In the sixth year and in the sixteenth year, likewise in the\nyear of his marriage and during the pregnancy p. 220 of his wife, he shall\navoid the use of a razor."--Haradatta.\n\n[219:8](sbe0273.htm#fr_1037) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 12, 9.\n\n[219:9](sbe0273.htm#fr_1038) Manu IV, 63.\n\n[219:10](sbe0273.htm#fr_1039) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 1.\n\n[219:11](sbe0273.htm#fr_1040) \xc3\x82pastamba, I, 4, 21; I, 5, 15, 3.\n\n[219:12](sbe0273.htm#fr_1041) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 30, 18-20.\n\n[219:13](sbe0273.htm#fr_1042) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 30, 22.\n\n[219:14](sbe0273.htm#fr_1043) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 30, 21. Haradatta remarks that\nsome explain losh _th_ a, \'a clod of earth,\' by kapala, \'a pot-sherd.\'\n\n[219:15](sbe0273.htm#fr_1044) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 8, 20, 11-12. Kapala, \'pot-\nsherds,\' may also mean \'skull-bones.\'\n\n[219:16](sbe0273.htm#fr_1045) Manu IV, 57. Haradatta says that only a\nconversation, p. 221 properly so called, is forbidden, not to ask barbarians\n&c. about the road and similar matters.\n\n[221:18](sbe0273.htm#fr_1046) Compare the analogous case, mentioned \xc3\x82pastamba\nI, 3, 9, 13.\n\n[221:19](sbe0273.htm#fr_1047) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 31, 11.\n\n[221:22](sbe0273.htm#fr_1048) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 31, 16.\n\n[221:23](sbe0273.htm#fr_1049) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 31, 10. Haradatta remarks that\nthe prohibition does not extend to those cases where the Vedic ritual requires\nthe fact to be pointed out. \'He is, of course, right in making this statement,\nas an express injunction of the _S_ ruti always overrides the rules of the Sm\n_ri_ ti.\n\n[221:24](sbe0273.htm#fr_1050) Haradatta adds that this and the preceding\nSutras include by implication the cases where a cow does damage in a field;\nsee \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 31, 9.\n\n[221:25](sbe0273.htm#fr_1051) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 1, 1, 21-II, 1, 2, 1.\n\n[221:26](sbe0273.htm#fr_1052) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 32, 3.\n\n[222:27](sbe0273.htm#fr_1053) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 32, 15.\n\n[222:29](sbe0273.htm#fr_1054)-30.

Haradatta adds that he\nmay wrap up his head while sitting down and in walking when the sun or rain\nannoys him.\n\n[223:38](sbe0273.htm#fr_1058) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 30, 15.\n\n[223:39](sbe0273.htm#fr_1059) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 31, 2.\n\n[223:40](sbe0273.htm#fr_1060) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 30, 16-18.\n\n[223:41](sbe0273.htm#fr_1061) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 31, 1.\n\n[223:43](sbe0273.htm#fr_1062) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 31, 3.\n\n[223:44](sbe0273.htm#fr_1063) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 32, 9.\n\n[223:45](sbe0273.htm#fr_1064) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 14, 22.\n\n[223:46](sbe0273.htm#fr_1065) Colebrooke, Mitakshara II, 1, 22. \'He shall use\nthe morning, according to his ability, for acts tending to the acquisition of\nspiritual merit, such as reciting the Vedas; the middle part of the day for\nthe acquisition of wealth; and the evening for scenting himself, adorning\nhimself with garlands and the like acts giving pleasure.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[223:47](sbe0273.htm#fr_1066) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 20, 1-4.\n\n[224:48](sbe0273.htm#fr_1067) Manu IV, 53.\n\n[224:50](sbe0273.htm#fr_1068) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 5, 19; Manu IV, 175, 177.\n\n[224:51](sbe0273.htm#fr_1069) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 32, 28; II, 8, 20, 16.\n\n[224:52](sbe0273.htm#fr_1070) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 31, 13. Haradatta remarks that\nthe word \'calf\' is used to designate any animal of the bovine species.\n\n[224:56](sbe0273.htm#fr_1071) Manu IV, 63.\n\n[224:57](sbe0273.htm#fr_1072) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 32.\n\n[224:58](sbe0273.htm#fr_1073) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 8, 18, 1; II, 8, 20, 10. Haradatta\nadds that this rule has been inserted here instead of in the chapter on\nforbidden food in order to indicate that its breach must be expiated by the\npenance prescribed for a breach of the Snataka\'s vow, not by that prescribed\nfor eating forbidden food.\n\n[225:59](sbe0273.htm#fr_1074) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 1, 1, 2; II, 2, 3, 11.\n\n[225:60](sbe0273.htm#fr_1075) Manu IV, 75.\n\n[225:61](sbe0273.htm#fr_1076) Manu IV, 61.\n\n[225:62](sbe0273.htm#fr_1077) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 32, 29; I, 7, 20, 8. Haradatta\nadds that the plural is used in the above Sutra in order to indicate that many\nBrahma _n_ as must be unanimous regarding the practices to be followed.\n\n[225:63](sbe0273.htm#fr_1078) Manu IV, 33; X, 113. \'For the sake of these\nobjects he may go to a ruler, i.e. a king without cringing, because the\npreposition adhi is used (in the text, and) adhi denotes mastership\' (Pa _n_\nini I, 4, 97). The meaning that he shall go (as becomes) an independent man.\'\n--Haradatta.\n\n[225:65](sbe0273.htm#fr_1079) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 15, 22; I, 11, 32, 18. \xc3\x82ryans\ni.e. Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, and Vai _s_ yas:\n\n[225:66](sbe0273.htm#fr_1080) Manu IV, 39. \'A cow, a Brahma _n_ a, a well-\nknown tree, p. 226 and the like are called excellent (beings or things). An\nauspicious (object), i.e. a filled jar and the like.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[226:67](sbe0273.htm#fr_1081) Haradatta observes that this rule refers to\ncases where, being in a hurry, one cannot show one\'s reverence in the manner\ndescribed in the preceding Sutra.\n\n[226:68](sbe0273.htm#fr_1082) Manu IV, 138, 175, 236.\n\n[226:70](sbe0273.htm#fr_1083) Manu IV, 80-81.\n\n[226:71](sbe0273.htm#fr_1084) Purification is here again mentioned in order\n(to indicate that Snataka must pay) particular attention to it.\n\n[226:72](sbe0273.htm#fr_1085) Manu IV, 147-149.\n\n[226:73](sbe0273.htm#fr_1086) Manu IV, 2, 238, 246.\n\n[226:74](sbe0273.htm#fr_1087) Manu II, 260.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter X](sbe0274.htm)\n\n'
