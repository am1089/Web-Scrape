Of the sacrifices of the new and full moon, the full-moon sacrifice\nshould be performed first.\n\n2\\. If (the term for the sacrifice) of the new moon comes first, he should\nfirst celebrate the full-moon sacrifice and then perform that.\n\n3\\. Some say that he should not perform it, and wait till the day of the full\nmoon.\n\n4 4. In the afternoon, husband and wife, after having bathed, should eat fast-\nday food.\n\n5 5-8. Manadantavya has said: 'He who eats fast-day food, obtains offspring\nbetter than himself; he gains favour; hunger will not attack him.'\n\n6\\. Therefore one should eat (fast-day food) which he likes.\n\n7\\. He should do nothing unholy (such as cohabiting with his wife).\n\n8\\. After he has sacrificed the morning oblation,\n\n9 9-16. He should pour out the sacrificial food with (the formula), 'Agreeable\nto such and such (a deity) I pour thee out:' (this formula) referring to the\n\nII, 1, 1. paur _n_ amasopakramau dar _s_ apaur _n_ amasau. 2. dar _s_ a _m_\n_k_ et purvam upapadyeta paur _n_ amasenesh _t_ vatha tat kuryad. 3. akurvan\npaur _n_ amasim aka\xe1\xb9\x85kshed ity eke. 4. \xe0\xa4\xbdparah _n_ e snatvaupavasathika _m_\ndampati bhu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ iyatam. 5.

He should wash (the food) thrice, (if it is destined) for gods;\n\n11\\. Twice, if for men;\n\n12\\. Once, if for the Fathers.\n\n13\\. Stirring it up with the pot-ladle from the left to the right he should\ncook it.\n\n14\\. When he has cooked it, he should sprinkle (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on it, should take\nit from the fire towards the north, and should again sprinkle (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on\nit.\n\n15\\. Thus all kinds of Havis (are prepared).\n\n16\\. Having put (the Havis) on the sacrificial grass,\n\n17 17-27. He should sacrifice the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions (in the following\nway): Having taken four portions of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya\xc2\x97five portions are taken by the Bh\n_ri_ gus (or at least?) by the _G_ amadagnyas [see Indische Studien, 10,\n95]\xc2\x97(he should make two oblations), to the north with (the formula), 'To Agni\nSvaha!' to the south with (the formula), 'To Soma Svaha!'\n\n18\\. Others (do it) conversely.\n\n19\\. Having 'spread under' \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, he should cut off with the pot-ladle\n(portions) of the Havis from the middle and from the eastern side;\n\n10\\. trir devebhya _h_ prakshalayed. 11. dvir manushyebhya _h_. 12. sak _ri_ t\npit _ri_ bhyo. 13. meksha _n_ ena pradakshi _n_ am udayuva _\xc3\xb1_ _s_ rapaye _k_.\n14. _kh_ _ri_ tam abhigharyodag udvasya pratyabhigharayet. 15. sarva _n_ y eva\n_m_ havi _m_ shi. 16. barhishy asadya. 17. \xe0\xa4\xbdgyabhagau _g_ uhuya _k_ _k_ aturg\n_ri_ hitam a _g_ ya _m_ g _ri_ hitva pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avatta _m_ Bh _ri_ gu _n_ a\n_m_ _G_ amadagnyanam Agnaye svahety uttarata _h_ Somayeti dakshi _n_ ato. 18.\nviparitam itara. 19. a _g_ yam upastirya havisho\xe0\xa4\xbdvadyen meksha _n_ ena madhyat\npurastad iti.\n\np. 391\n\n20\\. One who takes five cut-off portions (see Sutra 17), also from the western\nside.\n\n21\\. After he has sprinkled (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on (the cut-off portions), he anoints\nthe places from which he has cut them off, (with \xc3\x82 _g_ ya).\n\n22\\. (This anointing) is omitted at the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t oblation.\n\n23\\. He should sacrifice with (the formula), 'To N.N. Svaha!'\xc2\x97according to the\ngod to whom the oblation belongs.\n\n24\\. At the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t oblation he 'spreads under' once\xc2\x97twice if he\nis a Bh _ri_ gu\xc2\x97(cuts off) once (a portion) of the Havis, sprinkles (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya)\non it twice, and sacrifices it in a north-eastern direction with (the\nformula), 'To Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t Svaha!\n\n25\\. Having put a piece of wood (on the fire),\n\n26\\. He should dip Darbha-blades (of the sacrificial grass strewn round the\nfire) three times, the points, the middle, and the roots, into the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya or\ninto the Havis with (the words), 'May the birds come, licking what has been\nanointed.' Then, after having sprinkled (those Darbha-blades with water), he\nshould throw them into the fire, with (the verse), 'Thou who art the lord of\ncattle, Rudra, who walkest with the lines (of cattle), the manly one: do no\nharm to our cattle; let this be offered to thee.
