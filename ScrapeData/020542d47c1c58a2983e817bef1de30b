His _Yoga S \xc5\xabtras_\ngive definitions and instructions which are accepted by all teachers, even\nwhen they also make additions in minor matters. He begins with a description\nof yoga as " _Chitta vritti nirodha_." 1 _Chitta_ is the mind, the instrument\nthat stands between the man and the world. As a gardener uses a spade for\ndigging, so a man uses the mind for dealing with the world. Acted upon by the\nthings of the outer world through the senses, it presents to the man within a\npicture of those things, as on the plate of a camera. Acted upon by the will\nof the man within, it transmits into action in the body the thought-power that\n\np. 16\n\nis its positive characteristic. It thus has two functions\xc2\x97one receptive or\nnegative, the other active or positive. It transmits from the world to the man\nwithin, and also from the man within to the outer world.\n\n_Vritti_ means literally a whirlpool, and _nirodha_ signifies restraint or\ncontrol. Thus yoga practice is control of the whirlpools or changes of the\nmind or, in simple terms, voluntary direction of what is commonly called\nthought, or control of the ideas which are in the mind.\n\nThe mind of the average man is far from being an instrument within his\ncontrol. It is being impressed at all times, even during sleep to some extent,\nwith the pictures of a thousand objects clamoring for his attention, through\nears, skin, eyes, nose and mouth, and by telepathic impressions from others.\nIn addition to all that, it is in a state of agitation on its own account,\nbubbling in a hundred places with disturbing visions, excited by uncontrolled\nemotion or worrying thoughts. Let him achieve control of all this, says\nPatanjali, and his reward will be that he shall stand in his own state. 2\n\nThat a man should be in his own true state has two meanings: first, that in\nhis repose he will be utterly himself, not troubled with the whirlpools,\nwhich, however slight, are in the eyes of the yogi nothing\n\np. 17\n\nbut worry, and secondly, that in his activity as a man, using the mind, he\nwill be a positive thinker, not merely a receptacle for impressions from\noutside and ideas which he has collected in the course of time.\n\nIdeas in the mind should be material for thought, not merely ideas, just as\nthe muscles are useful means of action, not mere lumps of flesh. To be a\npositive thinker, lover and willer, master in one\'s own house, is to be\noneself, in one\'s own true state; all the rest is slavery or bondage, willing\nor unwilling. To its master, the man, the _vrittis_ of _chitta_ are always\nonly objects of knowledge, because of his not being involved in them, say\nAphorisms iv 18-20. 3 These _vrittis_ are ideas or items in the mind.\n\nThe final aim of Patanjali\'s yoga is to cease this slavery and achieve\nfreedom. The technical name for this great achievement is _kaivalya_ ,\nindependence. 4 That is really only another name for divinity, for material\nthings are in bondage, unable to move of themselves, and always moved by\nforces from the outside; but the divine is by definition free, able to move of\nitself. Every man feels in himself some spark of that divine freedom, which he\nthen calls the will, and that is the power with which he can control his mind.\n\nIn Patanjali\'s yoga the aspirant uses his will in\n\np. 18\n\nself-control. Thought governs things, we know; so much so that every voluntary\nmovement of the body follows a mental picture; therefore all work done by us,\neven with the hands, is done by thought-power. But will controls thought,\nconcentrates it, expands it, causes its flow\xc2\x97directs, in fact, its three\noperations of concentration, meditation, and contemplation. The perfection of\nthese three is the aim of the Patanjali yoga exercises.\n\nBefore proceeding with the systematic description of the practices of yoga,\nwhich begins in his Book ii, Patanjali mentions two things which are necessary\nfor success in controlling the _vrittis_ or thoughts, namely _abhy \xc4\x81sa_ and\n_vair \xc4\x81gya_. _Abhy \xc4\x81sa_ means constant practice in the effort to secure\nsteadiness of mind. 5 _Vair \xc4\x81gya_ is that condition of the feelings in which\nthey are not colored by outside things, but are directed only by our own best\njudgment. 6 This detachment of the emotions may be "lower" or "higher"\naccording as it is born from dislike of external conditions, or from a vision\nof the glorious joy of the pure free life. 7 The higher uncoloredness leads to\nthe highest contemplation, and therefore to freedom, the goal of this yoga.\n\np. 19\n\nPatanjali\'s systematic instruction for practical training is given in two\nportions. The first part, called _Kriy \xc4\x81 Yoga_, 8 is often translated as\npreliminary yoga because a person who has not first practiced it is not likely\nto succeed in the main portion, the _ashtanga_ , 9 or "eight limbs" of yoga\npractice. But it is much more than preliminary. It is the yoga of action, the\nyoga which must be practiced all the time in daily life. Without it,\nmeditation would be useless, for yoga involves not retirement or retreat but a\nchange in attitude towards the world. It. is in the midst of life\'s activities\nthat our freedom must be realized, for to desire to slip away into some\nuntroubled sphere would be mere escape, a perpetuation of the dream of the\nbest we have so far learned to know, a denial of the possibility of our real\nfreedom. A man must become master of himself, whatever other people and\nbeings, whose activities constitute the major portion of his world, may do.\n\nThe object of the preliminary yoga or yoga of action is to weaken what are\ncalled the five _kleshas_. A _klesha_ is literally an affliction, just as one\nwould speak of a crooked spine or blindness as an affliction. The five\nafflictions are _avidy \xc4\x81_, _asmit \xc4\x81_, _r \xc4\x81ga_, _dwesha_ and _abhinivesha_ ,\nwhich may be translated ignorance,\n\np. 20\n\negotism, liking and disliking, and possessiveness. One leading ancient\ncommentator on the Aphorisms, named Vy\xc4\x81sa, states that these, when active,\nbring one under the authority of Nature, and produce instability, a stream of\ncauses and effects in the world, and dependence upon others. They are faults\nof the man himself, not outside causes of trouble; the world can never hurt\nus, except through our own faults, and these five reduce us to pitiful\nslavery. Having submitted to these, a man is constantly moved from outside,\ngoverned too much by circumstances.\n\n"Ignorance" describes all those activities of the mind which do not take into\naccount the fact that man is in himself eternal, pure and painless. 10 The man\nwho does not accept his own true nature as eternal, pure and painless, will\njudge and value all objects improperly. A house, a chair and a pen are\nsomething to a man, by which he can satisfy his body and mind. They could not\nbe the same things to a cow. But the question now is: what are all these\nthings to the real man, who is eternal, pure and painless? To look at all\nthings as for the use of such a being is to begin to see them without error.\nIt is to have true motives.\n\n"Egotism" is the tendency to think "I am this," 11 and the desire that other\npeople also should think\n\np. 21\n\none to be this or that. Thinking oneself to be a certain object or mind, or\nthe combination of these even in the form of an excellent and useful\npersonality, means attachment to things. We are not a personality, but we\npossess one, and it is not to be despised if it is useful to the real man.\n\nThe error of Self-personality or egotism leads to the next two afflictions\nwhich are personal liking and disliking. These two are those unreasoning\nimpulses which lead men to judge and value things by their influence on the\ncomforts and pleasures and prides of the personality, not according to their\nvalue for an immortal being. 12\n\nThe fifth affliction is "possessiveness," beginning with clinging to the body,\nwhich indicates the lack of that insight which causes a man to regard the body\nas a mere instrument which he is willing to use, and wear out in the course of\ntime. 13\n\nIn this affliction we have not merely the fear of death, but that of old age\nas well, for men forget that the bodily life has its phases\xc2\x97childhood, youth,\nmanhood and old age\xc2\x97and each of these has its own perfections, though it has\nnot the perfections of the other stages. In this course there is constant\napparent loss as well as gain, because no man can pay full attention to all\nthe lessons of life at once, or exert at the same\n\np. 22\n\ntime all his faculties, any more than a child in school can properly think of\ngeography, history and mathematics in the period which is devoted to music.\n\nIn Hindu life, before it was disturbed from the West, men were wise enough in\nold age to give the family business into the hands of their mature sons, and\ndevote themselves to the study and contemplation of life; and just as in the\nWest it is considered the bounden duty of parents to support their children\nwith every kindness and give them the opportunities that their stage in life\nrequires, so it was always considered in the East the duty of the grown up\nchildren to support their old people with every kindness, treat them with\nhonor and dignity as the source of their own opportunity and power, and give\nthem every opportunity that _their_ stage of life requires. The material\nrequirements of these retired people were very small\xc2\x97a corner in the home,\nsome food and occasional clothes.\n\nIt is not presumed that in the preliminary stages the candidate will\ncompletely destroy the five afflictions. His object will be attained if he\nsucceeds in definitely weakening them. Three kinds of practices are prescribed\nfor this purpose in the yoga of action. These are called _tapas_ , _sw\n\xc4\x81dhy\xc4\x81ya_ and _\xc4\xab shwara-pranidh\xc4\x81na_. 14\n\np. 23\n\nIt is impossible to translate these terms by a single word each, without\ncausing serious misunderstanding. The first is often translated as austerity,\nand sometimes even as mortification. The word means literally "heat" and the\nnearest English equivalent to that when it is applied to human conduct is\n"effort." The yog\xc4\xab must definitely do those things that are good, even when a\nspecial effort is necessary because old habits of the personality stand in the\nway. Briefly it means this: "Do for the body what you know to be good for it.\nDo not let laziness, selfishness, or thoughtlessness stand in the way of your\ndoing what you can to make the body and mind healthy and efficient."\n\nPatanjali does not explain the practice of _tapas_ , but Shri Krishna says, in\nthe seventeenth chapter of the _Bhagavad G \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81_ "Reverential action towards\nthe gods, the educated, the teachers and the wise, purity,\nstraightforwardness, continence, and harmlessness are _tapas_ of the body;\nspeech not causing excitement, truthful, affectionate and beneficial, and used\nin self-study is the _tapas_ of speech; clearness of thinking, coolness,\nquietness, self-control, and purity of subject-matter are the _tapas_ of\nmind." 15\n\nShri Krishna here gives a wider range to the meaning of _tapas_ than does\nPatanjali, who makes it particularly a matter concerning the body.\n\np. 24\n\nHow than can any one say that _tapas_ is self-torture? It is true that there\nhas grown up a system of painful practices, such as that of holding the arm\nstill until it withers, or sitting in the sun in the midst of a ring of fires,\nbut these are superstitions which have grown up round a valuable thing, as\nthey are liable to do everywhere. Those who follow these methods are few as\ncompared with the true yog\xc4\xab. All over the country there are Indian\ngentlemen\xc2\x97many of them Government servants who have a routine task with short\nworking hours\xc2\x97who every day spend some time in meditation, deliberately\nguiding themselves by the "Yoga S\xc5\xabtras."\n\nA great example of _tapas_ is that of the modern women. Their will-power in\nthe government of their bodies and in overcoming bodily self-indulgence\nexcites the greatest admiration. And their results are entirely in line with\nPatanjali\'s aphorism iii 45 in which he approves of "excellence of body" and\nrefers to it as consisting of correct form, charm, strength and very firm\nwell-knitness, all of which is the very reverse of mortification or self-\ncastigation, which some have erroneously attributed to yoga, because of\nsuperstition.\n\nThese delightful beings are not even willing to leave Nature just as she is,\nbut consider in many ways how to bring lightness and freedom from earthiness\n\np. 25\n\nor grossness or clumsiness into bodily living and bodily appearance. Even the\nartificialities of high heels and very slender figures have the same\n"spiritual" background, and where excess or unbalance occurs it can at least\nbe credited to good intentions, carried out with great will-power or _tapas_.\nThe proportion of _tapas_ is on the increase all the time as seen by the\nexercises and dietary courses which are extensively advertised and the\nthoroughness and continuity with which they are carried out.\n\nMan himself, too, it must be said, shares a little in this sort of effort,\nshaving or at least trimming his beard and whiskers, and padding his shoulders\nto ridiculous excess, as he used to do his calves in the old days when\ntrousers were worn short and stockings were the vogue.\n\nIn all these matters there has been plenty of _effort_ , in the main tending\naway from uncouth and un-mastered living. I know some of both sexes who\nassiduously perform what our yog\xc4\xabs call _uddiy \xc4\x81na_, the exercises of the\nabdominal muscles, with the effect of correct posture and adequate strength,\nthus attaining the "natural corset," as it has been called, essential to\nhealth and good appearance. There is no doubt that such exercises are\nnecessary for those who do not do work involving bending, and it is not a bad\nthing that this undertaking calls for considerable will-power\n\np. 26\n\nwhich then becomes useful also for other purposes as well, and also\ncontributes to the enjoyment of consciousness.\n\nThe second practice, _sw \xc4\x81dhy\xc4\x81ya_, means the study of books that really\nconcern yourself as an immortal being. Psychology, philosophy and ethics come\nin here. Give up indiscriminate reading, and study what bears upon your\nprogress, is the advice.\n\nThe third practice, _\xc4\xab shwara-pranidh\xc4\x81na_, means devotion to God, but God as\nunderstood by the Hindu, as the perfect Being pervading all things, the life\nof the world, the inner impulse of which each one of us is a _share_. The\naspirant must habituate himself to see that Principle in everything, to accept\nall as from that hand. "Everything that is received is a gift," says a Hindu\nproverb; more than that, it is a gift from God, presented with perfect wisdom,\nto be accepted, therefore, with cheerfulness and joy. Behind the eyes of every\nperson he meets, the aspirant must also see the Divine. The common salutation\nof the Hindu, with the palms together, looks curious to the Westerner, as\nresembling prayer. It _is_ prayer\xc2\x97the recognition of God within our fellow-\nman. It is appreciation, the opposite of depreciation. _Ishwara-pranidh \xc4\x81na_\nis in effect the full appreciation of everything. It makes for maximum\nattentiveness and thus maximum living.\n\nThis practice develops right feeling towards everything;\n\np. 27\n\nthe previous one right thought, and the first right use of the will, and the\nthree together, pursued diligently for even a short time, play havoc with the\nfive afflictions.\n\nWhen the candidate has weakened the afflictions to some extent, he is ready\nfor Patanjali\'s regular course, the eight "limbs" of yoga. These may be\ndivided into three sets: two moral, three external, and three internal, as\nshown in the following list:\xc2\x97\n\n1.\n\n|\n\n_Yama_ ,\n\n|\n\nFive abstentions.\n\n|\n\nEthical  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n2.\n\n|\n\n_Niyama_.\n\n|\n\nFive observances.  \n  \n3.\n\n|\n\n_\xc4\x80 san\xc4\x81_.\n\n|\n\nBalanced posture.\n\n|\n\nExternal  \n  \n4.\n\n|\n\n_Pr \xc4\x81n\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma_.\n\n|\n\nRegularity of breath.  \n  \n5.\n\n|\n\n_Praty \xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra_.\n\n|\n\nWithdrawal of senses.  \n  \n6.\n\n|\n\n_Dh \xc4\x81ran\xc4\x81_.\n\n|\n\nConcentration.\n\n|\n\nInternal  \n  \n7.\n\n|\n\n_Dhy \xc4\x81na_.\n\n|\n\nMeditation.  \n  \n8.\n\n|\n\n_Sam \xc4\x81dhi_.\n\n|\n\nContemplation.  \n  \nThe two ethical or moral "limbs" of yoga contain five rules each, which the\nman must practice in his daily life. Put together, they make what we may call\n"the ten commandments." The first five are; "Thou shalt not (a) injure, (b)\nlie, (c) steal, (d) be sensual and (e) be greedy." 16\n\nExplaining this aphorism, Vy\xc4\x81sa says that _ahims \xc4\x81_ or non-injury is placed\nfirst because it is the source of the following nine. Thus the brotherhood\nprinciple\n\np. 28\n\nis considered as fundamental. Truth, for example, can hardly arise unless\nthere is a motive beyond selfish desires. Vy\xc4\x81sa explains that this means word\nand thought being in accordance with facts to the best of our knowledge. Only\nif speech is not deceptive, confused or empty of knowledge, he says, is it\ntruth, because speech is uttered for the purpose of transferring one\'s\nknowledge to another.\n\nV\xc4\x81chaspati\'s glossary interprets truth as word and thought in accordance with\nfacts, and fact as what is really believed or understood by us on account of\nour own direct experience, our best judgment or the accepted testimony of\nreliable witnesses. So yoga is rooted in virtue, and that in brotherhood, or a\nfeeling for others. Without at least the desire for these five, though\nperfection in them may not be attained, contemplation cannot yield its richest\nfruits. We are to be at peace with the world, even if the world is not at\npeace with us. In this case there is no _desire_ to injure, lie, steal etc.\nSuch activities are not sources of pleasure, in any circumstances.\n\nThe second five are: "Thou shalt be (a) clean, (b) content, (c) self-\ncontrolled, (d) studious, and (e) devoted." 17 Few comments are needed on\nthese. Contentment does not mean satisfaction, but willingness to accept\nthings as they are and to make the most of\n\np. 29\n\nthem. Without dissatisfaction one would not take to yoga. It implies a desire\nto improve one\'s life. The remaining three are _tapas_ , _sw \xc4\x81dhy\xc4\x81ya_ and _\xc4\xab\nshwara-pranidh\xc4\x81na_, the preliminary yoga or yoga of daily life\xc2\x97apart from any\nprivate exercises\xc2\x97still carried on.\n\nBy the attainment of these five a man can be at peace with the world. It is\nthe end of antagonism _from his side_.\n\nIncidentally, Patanjali mentions that when the ten virtues are firmly\nestablished in a person\'s character definite effects will begin to appear,\nsuch as absence of danger, effectiveness of speech, the arrival of unsought\nwealth, vigor of body and mind, understanding of life\'s events, clarity of\nthought, steadiness of attention, control of the senses, great happiness,\nperfection of body and senses, intuition and realization of one\'s true self.\n18 These can come only after the cessation of all antagonisms to anybody or\nanything in the world.\n\nNow we come to what some will regard as the more practical steps, though to\nthe understanding yog\xc4\xab nothing can be more practical than the ten\ncommandments. Of these the three external steps are _\xc4\x81 san\xc4\x81_, _pr \xc4\x81n\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma_ and\n_praty \xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra_. The first is right posture, the second right breathing and the\nthird control of\n\np. 30\n\nthe senses. They mean the training of the outer instrument or body so that it\nwill offer no impediment to the serious practices of meditation which are to\nbe taken up.\n\nFirst, one must learn to sit quite still in a chosen healthy position. "The\nposture must be steady and pleasant," 19 says Patanjali\xc2\x97that is all. There is\nno recommendation of any particular posture, least of all any distorted,\npainful, or unhealthy position. Posture is achieved when it becomes effortless\nand the mind easily forgets the body. It is chiefly a matter of balance. Some\npractice of balanced sitting, whether on the ground or on a chair is necessary\nuntil balanced musculature is attained. Very often there is fatigue because\nsome of the muscles are weak, yet to sit unbalanced for long is almost\nimpossible.\n\nNext, regulation of breath is necessary. 20 During meditation, people often\nforget to breathe normally; sometimes they breathe out and forget to breathe\nin again, and so are suddenly recalled to earth by a choking at the throat.\nMany people never breathe well and regularly at all; let them practice simple\nnatural exercises, such as those recommended by teachers of singing, and take\ncare that the body is breathing regularly and quietly before they enter their\nmeditation.\n\np. 31\n\nSometimes numbers or proportionate times are prescribed, and one of the most\nauthoritative in India is that in which one breathes in with the number 1,\nholds the breath with the number 4, breathes out with the number 2, and\nimmediately begins again; but it is impossible to prescribe the perfect\nnumbers, because they must differ with different people. The question really\nis: how long must your breath be so as to provide for enough oxidation?\nScience will some day say. But one must not hold it in longer than that, for\nto do so is to deprive the whole system of oxygen. Your body has to carry on\nall its ordinary sub-conscious activities while meditation is going on.\n\nThe only general practical advice one can give is that the breathing should be\nregular and a little slow, and there should be enough pause between\ninbreathing and outbreathing. It should also be calm, as may be judged by its\nnot causing much disturbance in the outside air. The student will soon find\nout what suits him. Stunts such as breathing up one nostril and down the\nother, or holding the breath for a long time, are not mentioned by Patanjali\nand should be generally avoided as dangerous.\n\n_Praty \xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra_ is the holding back of the senses from the objects of sense. 21\nOne must practice paying no attention to sounds or sights or skin sensations,\nquietening\n\np. 32\n\nthe senses so that they will create no disturbance during meditation.\n\nThink of what happens when you are reading an interesting book. Someone may\ncome into the room where you are, may walk past you to get something, and go\nout again; but perhaps you heard and saw nothing at all. You were in what is\nsometimes called a brown study. The ears were open and the waves of sound in\nthe air were no doubt agitating the tympanum, from which the nerves were\ncarrying their message to the brain. The eyes were open, and the light waves\nwere painting their pictures on the retina\xc2\x97but you saw and heard nothing,\nbecause your attention was turned away from those sensations.\n\nThe yog\xc4\xab must try to withdraw attention at will, so that in his meditation no\nsight or sound will distract him. This is helped by an absence of curiosity\nabout anything external during the time set apart for meditation. One way of\npracticing this is to sit and listen for a while to the various sounds of\nnature; then listen to the delicate sound in the ear and so forget the former\n(though you cannot watch yourself forgetting it); then listen to a mere mental\nsound conjured up by the imagination, and so forget even the music in the ear.\n\nThen come the three internal steps, to which everything else has been leading\nup, called _dh \xc5\xabran\xc4\x81_, _dhy \xc4\x81na_\n\np. 33\n\nand _sam \xc4\x81dhi_. They are concentration, meditation, and contemplation.\n\nConcentration is really voluntary attentiveness, but this involves narrowing\nthe field of view, focusing the mental eye upon a chosen object. 22\n\nWhen you practice concentration or meditation, always choose the object before\nyou begin. Sometimes people sit down and then try to decide what to\nconcentrate upon, and come to no settled decision before their time is all\ngone. Then, do not try to _hold_ the object in position by your thought. It is\nnot the object that is going to run away; it is the mind that wanders. Let the\nobject be thought of as in a natural position\xc2\x97if it is a pen it may be lying\non the table; if it is a picture it may be hanging on the wall. Then narrow\nthe field of attention down to it, and look at it with perfect calmness, and\nwithout any tension or sensation in the body or head.\n\nDo not be surprised or annoyed if other thoughts intrude on your\nconcentration. Be satisfied if you do not lose sight of your chosen object, if\nit remains the central thing before your attention. Take no notice of the\nintruding thoughts. Say "I do not care whether they are there or not." Keep\nthe emotions calm in this manner, and the intruders will disappear when you\nare not looking. Calmness\xc2\x97no physical strain\xc2\x97is\n\np. 34\n\nnecessary for successful concentration, and, given this, it is not at all the\ndifficult thing that it is sometimes supposed to be. Detailed methods for\npracticing concentration are given in my book _Concentration_ ," 23 and\nregarding that and the other seven steps as well in my _Practical Yoga:\nAncient and Modern_ , which contains my translation and explanation of all the\nPatanjali Yoga aphorisms. 24\n\nMeditation is a continuous flow or fountain of thought with regard to the\nobject of your concentration. 25 It involves the realization of that object as\nfully as possible. You must not let the string of thought go so far away on\nany line that the central object is in any way dimmed. On the contrary, every\nnew idea that you bring forward must be fully thought of only with reference\nto it and should make it clearer and stronger than before. Thus for practice\nyou might meditate on a cat. You would consider it in every detail; think of\nall its parts and qualities, physical, emotional, mental, moral and spiritual;\nthink of its relation to other animals and of particular cats that you have\nknown. When this is done you should\n\np. 35\n\nknow what a cat is much better than you did before. You will have brought into\nagreement and union all your knowledge or information on the subject. In this\nmeditation there is no clutching, no anxiety, only calm mental reviewing and\nthinking.\n\nThe same method applies to virtues such as truth, kindness and courage. Many\npeople have the most imperfect ideas as to what these are. Make concrete\npictures in the imagination of acts of kindness, courage, truth. Then try to\nrealize the states of emotion and mind, and the moral condition involved, and\nin doing so keep up the vividness of consciousness that has already been\nattained in the beginning of the practice on account of concentration on the\nconcrete scene.\n\nIn meditation you take something up, but it is the opposite of going to sleep,\nbecause you _retain_ the vivid qualities of reality which belong to the\nconcentrated waking state. Yet it should always be done with perfect calm, and\nno tension or excitement. It widens, includes and integrates without loss of\nthe quality gained by concentration or specific attentiveness.\n\nContemplation is another kind of concentration; this time a poise of the mind\nat the top end of your line of thought. 26 When in meditation you have reached\nthe highest and fullest thought you can about\n\np. 36\n\nthe chosen object, and your mind begins to waver, do not try to go forward,\nbut do not fall back. Hold what you have attained, and poise calmly on it for\na little time.\n\nYou will find that by contemplation you have created a platform. You have been\nmaking a new effort and so have developed or discovered some hitherto latent\npossibilities. There may be something in the nature of illumination. You must\nsee what comes; never try to predetermine it. Then contemplation opens the\ndoor of the mind to intuitive knowledge, and many powers.\n\nThe student is told always to begin with concentration, then proceed to\nmeditation. The triple process is a mind-poise called _sanyama_. 27\n\nIf the candidate wants to have what are commonly called psychic faculties and\npowers, Patanjali explains how he may obtain them\xc2\x97by _sanyama_ on various\nobjects having corresponding qualities. He mentions knowledge of past and\nfuture, memory of past lives, reading of others\xc2\x92 minds, perception of those\nwho have reached perfection, and other powers and knowledge connected with\n"higher hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell" 28 but remarks that, though\nthese are accomplishments of the out-going\n\np. 37\n\nmind, they are obstacles to the full or higher _sam \xc4\x81dhi_. 29 V\xc4\x81chaspati\ncomments on this that sometimes the mind is captivated by these psychic\npowers, just as a beggar may think of the possession of a little wealth as\nabundant riches, but the real yog\xc4\xab will reject them all. How can the real man,\nhe asks, who has determined to remove all pain\xc2\x97including psychological or\nemotional pains\xc2\x97take pleasure in such accomplishments, which are opposed to\nhis true state of being? Only by non-attachment to all such things, however\ngreat, may the seeds of bondage be destroyed, and independence or freedom be\nattained. 30\n\nTrue contemplation, poised on higher matters, Patanjali teaches, leads to the\ncomplete dispersal of the afflictions, and on to great clarity and insight,\nculminating in the cessation of the junction of the seer and the sight, the\nabsence of all pain and the uncovering of the inner light.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[15:1](gsoy04.htm#fr_0) Patanjali, book i, S\xc5\xabtra or Aphorism i 2.\n\n[16:2](gsoy04.htm#fr_1) Patanjali, Book i, Aphorism 3.\n\n[17:3](gsoy04.htm#fr_2) Aphorisms iv 18-20.\n\n[17:4](gsoy04.htm#fr_3) Aphorisms iii 49, 54; iv 26, 34.\n\n[18:5](gsoy04.htm#fr_4) Aphorism i 13.\n\n[18:6](gsoy04.htm#fr_5) Aphorism i 15.\n\n[18:7](gsoy04.htm#fr_6) Aphorism i 16.\n\n[19:8](gsoy04.htm#fr_7) Aphorism ii _et seq_.\n\n[19:9](gsoy04.htm#fr_8) Aphorism ii 29 _et seq_.\n\n[20:10](gsoy04.htm#fr_9) Aphorism ii 5.\n\n[20:11](gsoy04.htm#fr_10) Aphorism ii 6.\n\n[21:12](gsoy04.htm#fr_11) Aphorisms ii 7, 8.\n\n[21:13](gsoy04.htm#fr_12) Aphorism ii 9.\n\n[22:14](gsoy04.htm#fr_13) Aphorism ii I.\n\n[23:15](gsoy04.htm#fr_14) Verses xvii 14-16.\n\n[27:16](gsoy04.htm#fr_15) Aphorism ii 30.\n\n[28:17](gsoy04.htm#fr_16) Aphorism ii 32.\n\n[29:18](gsoy04.htm#fr_17) Aphorisms ii 35-45.\n\n[30:19](gsoy04.htm#fr_18) Aphorism ii 46.\n\n[30:20](gsoy04.htm#fr_19) Aphorism ii 49.\n\n[31:21](gsoy04.htm#fr_20) Aphorism ii 54.\n\n[33:22](gsoy04.htm#fr_21) Aphorism iii I.\n\n[34:23](gsoy04.htm#fr_22) Pub. by the Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar,\nMadras, India.\n\n[34:24](gsoy04.htm#fr_23) Pub. by E.
