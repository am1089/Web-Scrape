In passages\nsuch as \'hidden by the untrue\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 3, 2), the word \'untrue\' does\nnot denote the Undefinable; it rather means that which is different from \'\n_ri_ ta,\' and this latter word--as we see from the passage \'enjoying the _ri_\nta\' (Ka. Up. 1,3, 1)--denotes such actions as aim at no worldly end, but only\nat the propitiation of the highest Person, and thus\n\np. 125\n\nenable the devotee to reach him. The word \'an _ri_ ta\' therefore denotes\nactions of a different kind, i.e. such as aim at worldly results and thus\nstand in the way of the soul reaching Brahman; in agreement with the passage\n\'they do not find that Brahma-world, for they are carried away by an _ri_ ta\'\n( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 3, 2). Again, in the text \'Then there was neither non-Being\nnor Being\' ( _Ri_. Sa _m_ h. X, 129, 1), the terms \'being\' and \'non-being\'\ndenote intelligent and non-intelligent beings in their distributive state.\nWhat that text aims at stating is that intelligent and non-intelligent beings,\nwhich at the time of the origination of the world are called \'sat\' and \'tyat\'\n(Taitt. Up. II, 6), are, during the period of reabsorption, merged in the\ncollective totality of non-intelligent matter which the text denotes by the\nterm \'darkness\' (Ri. Sa _m_ h. X, 129, 3). There is thus no reference whatever\nto something \'not definable either as being or non-being\': the terms \'being\'\nand \'non-being\' are applied to different mode; of being at different times.\nThat the term \'darkness\' denotes the collective totality of non-intelligent\nmatter appears from another scriptural passage, viz, \'The Non-evolved\n(avyaktam) is merged in the Imperishable (akshara), the Imperishable in\ndarkness (tamas), darkness becomes one with the highest divinity.\' True, the\nword \'darkness\' denotes the subtle condition of primeval matter (prak _ri_\nti), which forms the totality of non-intelligent things; but this very Prak\n_ri_ ti is called Maya\\--in the text \'Know Prak _ri_ ti to be Maya,\' and this\nproves it be something \'undefinable\': Not so, we reply; we meet with no\npassages where the word \'Maya\' denotes that which is undefinable. But the word\n\'Maya\' is synonymous with \'mithya,\' i.e. falsehood, and hence denotes the\nUndefinable also. This, too, we cannot admit; for the word \'Maya\' does not in\nall places refer to what is false; we see it applied e.g. to such things as\nthe weapons of Asuras and Rakshasas, which are not \'false\' but real. \'Maya,\'\nin such passages, really denotes that which produces various wonderful\neffects, and it is in this sense that Prak _ri_ ti is called Maya. This\nappears from the passage ( _S_ vet. Up. IV, 9) \'From that the "mayin" creates\n\np. 126\n\nall this, and in that the other one is bound up by maya.\' For this text\ndeclares that Prak _ri_ ti--there called Maya\\--produces manifold wonderful\ncreations, and the highest Person is there called \'mayin\' because he possesses\nthat power of maya; not on account of any ignorance or nescience on his part.\nThe latter part of the text expressly says that (not the Lord but) another\none, i.e. the individual soul is bound up by maya; and therewith agrees\nanother text, viz. \'When the soul slumbering in beginningless Maya awakes\'\n(Gau _d_. Ka.). Again, in the text \'Indra goes multiform through the Mayas\' (\n_Ri_. Sa _m_ h. VI, 47, 18), the manifold powers of Indra are spoken of, and\nwith this agrees what the next verse says, \'he shines greatly as Tvash _tri_\n\': for an unreal being does not shine. And where the text says \'my Maya is\nhard to overcome\' (Bha. Gi. VII, 14), the qualification given there to Maya,\nviz. \'consisting of the gu _n_ as,\' shows that what is meant is Prak _ri_ ti\nconsisting of the three gu _n_ as.--All this shows that Scripture does not\nteach the existence of a \'principle called Nescience, not to be defined either\nas that which is or that which is not.\'\n\nNor again is such Nescience to be assumed for the reason that otherwise the\nscriptural statements of the unity of all being would be unmeaning. For if the\ntext \'Thou art that,\' be viewed as teaching the unity of the individual soul\nand the highest Self, there is certainly no reason, founded on unmeaningness,\nto ascribe to Brahman, intimated by the word \'that\'--which is all-knowing, &c.\n--Nescience, which is contradictory to Brahman\'s nature.--Itihasa and Pura _n_\na also do not anywhere teach that to Brahman there belongs Nescience.\n\nBut, an objection is raised, the Vish _n_ u Pura _n_ a, in the _s_ loka, \'The\nstars are Vish _n_ u,\' &c. (II, 12, 38), first refers to Brahman as one only,\nand comprising all things within itself; thereupon states in the next _s_ loka\nthat this entire world, with all its distinctions of hills, oceans, &c., is\nsprung out of the \'a _g \xc3\xb1_ana\' of Brahman, which in itself is pure \' _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana,\' i.e. knowledge; thereupon confirms the view of the world having sprung\nfrom a _g \xc3\xb1_ana by referring to the fact that Brahman, while abiding in its\nown nature, is free\n\np. 127\n\nfrom all difference ( _s_ l. 40); proves in the next two _s_ lokas the non-\nreality of plurality by a consideration of the things of this world; sums up,\nin the following _s_ loka, the unreality of all that is different from\nBrahman; then (43) explains that action is the root of that a _g \xc3\xb1_ana which\ncauses us to view the one uniform Brahman as manifold; thereupon declares the\nintelligence constituting Brahman\'s nature to be free from all distinction and\nimperfection (44); and finally teaches (45) that Brahman so constituted, alone\nis truly real, while the so-called reality of the world is merely\nconventional.--This is not, we reply, a true representation of the drift of\nthe passage. The passage at the outset states that, in addition to the\ndetailed description of the world given before, there will now be given a\nsuccinct account of another aspect of the world not yet touched upon. This\naccount has to be understood as follows. Of this universe, comprising\nintelligent and non-intelligent beings, the intelligent part--which is not to\nbe reached by mind and speech, to be known in its essential nature by the Self\nonly, and, owing to its purely intelligential character, not touched by the\ndifferences due to Prak _ri_ ti--is, owing to its imperishable nature, denoted\nas that which is; while the non-intelligent, material; part which, in\nconsequence of the actions of the intelligent beings undergoes manifold\nchanges, and thus is perishable, is denoted as that which is not. Both parts,\nhowever, form the body of Vasudeva, i.e. Brahman, and hence have Brahman for\ntheir Self. The text therefore says (37), \'From the waters which form the body\nof Vish _n_ u was produced the lotus-shaped earth, with its seas and\nmountains\': what is meant is that the entire Brahma-egg which has arisen from\nwater constitutes the body of which Vish _n_ u is the soul. This relation of\nsoul and body forms the basis of the statements of co-ordination made in the\nnext _s_ loka (38), \'The stars are Vish _n_ u,\' &c.; the same relation had\nbeen already declared in numerous previous passages of the Pura _n_ a (\'all\nthis is the body of Hari,\' &c.). All things in the world, whether they are or\nare not, are Vish _n_ u\'s body, and he is their soul. Of the next _s_ loka,\n\'Because the Lord has knowledge for his\n\np. 128\n\nessential nature,\' the meaning is \'Because of the Lord who abides as the Self\nof all individual souls, the essential nature is knowledge only--while bodies\ndivine, human, &c., have no part in it--, therefore all non-intelligent\nthings, bodies human and divine, hills, oceans, &c., spring from his\nknowledge, i.e. have their root in the actions springing from the volitions of\nmen, gods, &c., in whose various forms the fundamental intelligence manifests\nitself. And since non-intelligent matter is subject to changes corresponding\nto the actions of the individual souls, it may be called \'non-being,\' while\nthe souls are \'being.\'--This the next _s_ loka further explains \'when\nknowledge is pure,\' &c. The meaning is \'when the works which are the cause of\nthe distinction of things are destroyed, then all the distinctions of bodies,\nhuman or divine, hills, oceans, &c.--all which are objects of fruition for the\ndifferent individual souls--pass away.\' Non-intelligent matter, as entering\ninto various states of a non-permanent nature, is called \'non-being\'; while\nsouls, the nature of which consists in permanent knowledge, are called\n\'being.\' On this difference the next _s_ loka insists (41). We say \'it is\' of\nthat thing which is of a permanently uniform nature, not connected with the\nidea of beginning, middle and end, and which hence never becomes the object of\nthe notion of non-existence; while we say \'it is not\' of non-intelligent\nmatter which constantly passes over into different states, each later state\nbeing out of connexion with the earlier state. The constant changes to which\nnon-intelligent matter is liable are illustrated in the next _s_ loka, \'Earth\nis made into a jar,\' &c. And for this reason, the subsequent _s_ loka goes on\nto say that there _is_ nothing but knowledge. This fundamental knowledge or\nintelligence is, however, variously connected with manifold individual forms\nof being due to karman, and hence the text adds: \'The one intelligence is in\nmany ways connected with beings whose minds differ, owing to the difference of\ntheir own acts\' ( _s_ l 43, second half). Intelligence, pure, free from stain\nand grief, &c., which constitutes the intelligent element of the world, and\nunintelligent matter--these two together constitute the\n\np. 129\n\nworld, and the world is the body of Vasudeva; such is the purport of _s_ loka\n44.--The next _s_ loka sums up the whole doctrine; the words \'true and untrue\'\nthere denote what in the preceding verses had been called \'being\' and \'non-\nbeing\'; the second half of the _s_ loka refers to the practical plurality of\nthe world as due to karman.\n\nNow all these _s_ lokas do not contain a single word supporting the doctrine\nof a Brahman free from all difference; of a principle called Nescience abiding\nwithin Brahman and to be defined neither as that which is nor as that which is\nnot; and of the world being wrongly imagined, owing to Nescience. The\nexpressions \'that which is\' and \'that which is not\' ( _s_ l 35), and \'satya\'\n(true) and \'asatya\' (untrue; _s_ l 45), can in no way denote something not to\nbe defined either as being or non-being. By \'that which is not\' or \'which is\nuntrue,\' we have to understand not what is undefinable, but that which has no\ntrue being, in so far as it is changeable and perishable. Of this character is\nall non-intelligent matter. This also appears from the instance adduced in _s_\nl 42: the jar is something perishable, but not a thing devoid of proof or to\nbe sublated by true knowledge. \'Non-being\' we may call it, in so far as while\nit is observed at a certain moment in a certain form it is at some other\nmoment observed in a different condition. But there is no contradiction\nbetween two different conditions of a thing which are perceived at different\ntimes; and hence there is no reason to call it something futile (tu _khkh_ a)\nor false (mithya), &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Scripture does not teach that Release is due to the knowledge of a non-\nqualified Brahman.--the meaning of \'tat tvam asi.\'](sbe48031.htm)\n\n'
