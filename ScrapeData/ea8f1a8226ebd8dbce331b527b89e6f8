And should, after that person has eaten, seize his right hand,\n\n2. 2 If he wishes that one of his companions, or a pupil, or a servant should faithfully remain with him and not go away, he should bathe in the morning, should put on clean garments, should show\n\np. 176\n\npatience (with that servant, &c.) during the day, should speak (only) with\nBrahma _n_ as, and by night he should go to the dwelling-place of that person,\nshould make water into a horn of a living animal, and should three times walk\nround his dwelling-place, sprinkling (his urine) round it, with (the Mantra),\n'From the mountain (I sever?) thee, from thy brother, from thy sister, from\nall thy relations. parishida _h_ kleshyati (i.e. kvaishyasi?) _s_ a _s_ vat\nparikupilena sa _m_ krame _n_ avi _k_ _kh_ ida, ulena parimi _dh_ o\xe0\xa4\xbdsi parimi\n_dh_ o\xe0\xa4\xbdsy ulena.'\n\n3\\. He puts down the horn of the living animal in a place which is generally\naccessible.\n\n4. 4 One whose companions, pupils, or servants use to run away, should rebuke them with (the Mantra), 'May he who calls hither (?), call you hither! He who brings back, has brought you back (?). May the rebuke of Indra always rebuke you. If you, who worship your own deceit, despise me (?), . . . . may Indra bind you with his bond, and may he drive you back again to me.'\n\np. 177\n\n5\\. Then he enters his house, puts a piece of Sidhraka wood on (the fire), and\nsacrifices with the 'on-drawing verse,' 'Back-bringer, bring them back'\n(Taitt. Sa _m_ h. III, 3, 10, 1).\n\n6\\. Now (we shall explain) how one should guard his wife.\n\n7. 7 One whose wife has a paramour, should grind big centipedes (?) to powder, and should insert (that powder), while his wife is sleeping, into her secret parts, with the Mantra, 'Indra. . . . from other men than me.'\n\n8\\.

Mat _ri_ datta: 'The description of the\nSamavartana is finished. p. 176 Now some ceremonies connected with special\nwishes of the person who has performed the Samavartana and has settled in a\nhouse, will be described.' In my opinion, it would be more correct to consider\nSutra 18 of the preceding section as the last of the aphorisms that regard the\nSamavartana, With Sutra 2 compare Paraskara III, 7; \xc3\x82pastamba VIII, 23, 6. It\nseems impossible to attempt to translate the hopelessly corrupt last lines of\nthe Mantra.\n\n[176:4](sbe30057.htm#fr_582) A part of this Mantra also is most corrupt. In\nthe first line I propose to write, nivarto vo nyaviv _ri_ tat. With the last\nline comp. Paraskara III, 7, 3. I think that the text of Paraskara should be\ncorrected in the following way: pari tva hvalano hvalan nivartas tva nyaviv\n_ri_ tat, indra _h_ pa _s_ ena sitva tva mahyam . . . (three syllables)\nanayet. The \xc3\x82pastambiya Mantrapa _th_ a, according to Dr. Winternitz's copy,\ngives the following text: anupohvad anuhvayo vivartto p. 177 vo nyaviv _ri_\ndhat. aindra _h_ parikro _s_ o to va _h_ parikro _s_ atu sarvata _h_. yadi mam\natimanyadva a deva devavattara indra _h_ pa _s_ ena _s_ itkva vo mahyam id va\n_s_ am anayat svaha. Comp. Prof. Pischel's remarks, Philologische\nAbhandlungen, Martin Hertz zum siebzigsten Geburtstage von ehemaligen Schulern\ndargebracht (Berlin, 1888), p. 69 seq.\n\n[177:7](sbe30057.htm#fr_583) On sthura dri _dh_ a[ _h_ ] Mat _ri_ datta says,\nsthura d _ri_ _dh_ a _h_ sthura _h_ _s_ atapadya _h_. A part of the Mantra is\nuntranslatable on account of the very corrupt condition of the text. The\nreading given by most of the MSS. is, Indraya yasya _s_ epham alikam anyebhya\n_h_ purushebhyo\xe0\xa4\xbdnyatra mat. The \xc3\x82pastambiya Mantrapa _th_ a reads, indrayasya\nphaligam anyebhya _h_ purushebhyonyatra mat. The meaning very probably is that\nIndra is invoked to keep away from the woman the _s_ epha of all other men\nexcept her husband's.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 15](sbe30058.htm)\n\n"
