He who desires proper food 1 should use the hymn, agnim naro didhitibhi\n_h_ (Rv. VII, 1, 1) 2.\n\n2\\. Verily, Agni (fire) is the eater of food.\n\nIn the other (recitations accompanying the) offerings of a _g_ ya (where Agni\nis likewise mentioned) the worshippers come more slowly near to Agni (because\nthe name of Agni does not stand at the beginning of the hymn). But here a\nworshipper obtains proper food at once, he strikes down evil at once.\n\n3\\. Through the words (occurring in the second foot of the first verse), hasta\n_k_ yuti _g_ anayanta, 'they caused the birth of Agni by moving their arms,'\nthe hymn becomes endowed with (the word) birth. Verily, the sacrificer is born\nfrom this day of the sacrifice, and therefore the hymn is endowed with (the\nword) birth.\n\n4\\. There are four metrical feet (in the Trish _t_ ubh verses of this hymn).\nVerily, cattle have four feet, therefore they serve for the gaining of cattle.\n\n5\\. There are three metrical feet (in the Vira _g_ , verses of this hymn).\nVerily, three are these three-fold\n\np. 160\n\nworlds. Therefore they serve for the conquest of the worlds.\n\n6\\. These (the Trish _t_ ubh and Vira _g_ verses of the hymn) form two metres,\nwhich form a support (pratish _th_ a). Verily, man is supported by two (feet),\ncattle by four feet. Therefore this hymn places the sacrificer who stands on\ntwo feet among cattle which stand on four.\n\n7\\. By saying them straight on there are twenty-five verses in this hymn. Man\nalso consists of twenty-five. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on\nhis feet, two legs, two arms, and the trunk (atman) the twenty-fifth. He\nadorns that trunk, the twenty-fifth, by this hymn.\n\n8\\. And then this day (of the sacrifice) consists of twenty-five, and the\nStoma hymn of that day consists of twenty-five 1 (verses); it becomes the same\nthrough the same. Therefore these two, the day and the hymn, are twenty-five\n2.\n\n9\\. These twenty-five verses, by repeating the first thrice and the last\nthrice, become thirty less one. This is a Vira _g_ , verse (consisting of\nthirty syllables), too small by one. Into the small (heart) the vital spirits\nare placed, into the small stomach food is placed 3, therefore this Vira _g_ ,\nsmall by one, serves for the obtainment of those desires.\n\n10\\. He who knows this, obtains those desires.\n\n11\\. The verses (contained in the hymn agnim naro didhitibhi _h_ ) become the\nB _ri_ hati 4 metre and\n\np. 161\n\nthe Vira _g_ metre, (they become) the perfection which belongs to that day\n(the mahavrata). Then they also become Anush _t_ ubh 1, for the offerings of a\n_g_ ya (ghee) dwell in Anush _t_ ubhs 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[159:1](sbe01181.htm#fr_384) Annadyam is always explained as food, here as\nannam tad adya _m_ _k_ a. It must be so translated here and elsewhere (1, 2,\n10), though it is often an abstract of annada, an eater of food, a healthy\nman.\n\n[159:2](sbe01181.htm#fr_385) This hymn is prescribed in the Vi _s_ va _g_ it\nsacrifice, and taken over to the Mahavrata, according to rule. It is used,\nhowever, both as obligatory and as optional at the same time, i. e. it is an\nessential part of the sacrifice, and at the same time to be used by those who\nwish for proper food.\n\n[160:1](sbe01181.htm#fr_386) Cf. Ait. \xc3\x82r. I, 1, 4, 21; II, 3, 4, 2.\n\n[160:2](sbe01181.htm#fr_387) The plural after the dual is explained by the\nfact that the hymn means the twenty-five verses.\n\n[160:3](sbe01181.htm#fr_388) Cf. I, 3, 7, 5.\n\n[160:4](sbe01181.htm#fr_389) The hymn consists of eighteen Vira _g_ and seven\nTrish _t_ ubh p. 161 verses. Therefore the eighteen Vira _g_ verses remain\nwhat they are, only that the first is repeated three times, so that we have\ntwenty Vira _g_ verses. The seven Trish _t_ ubhs, by repeating the last three\ntimes, become nine. We then take eight syllables away from each verse, thus\nchanging them into nine B _ri_ hati verses. The nine times eight syllables,\nwhich were taken off, give us seventy-two syllables, and as each B _ri_ hati\nconsists of thirty-six syllables, two B _ri_ hatis.\n\n[161:1](sbe01181.htm#fr_390) The change of the first verse, which is a Vira\n_g_ of thirty-three syllables, into an Anush _t_ ubh is produced by a still\neasier process. The first Vira _g_ consists here of thirty-three syllables,\nthe Anush _t_ ubh should have thirty-two. But one or two syllables more or\nless does not destroy a metre, according to the views of native metricians.\nThe Vira _g_ itself, for instance, should have thirty syllables, and here has\nthirty-three. Therefore if changed into an Anush _t_ ubh, it simply has one\nsyllable over, which is of no consequence. Comm.\n\n[161:2](sbe01181.htm#fr_391) Cf. Ait. \xc3\x82r.
