Bring us, O youngest god, Bharata [1](sbe46057.htm#an_2:7:1:1), Agni, the\nbest, resplendent, much-desired wealth, O Vasu [2](sbe46057.htm#an_2:7:1:2)!\n\n2\\. May no malign power of a god or of a mortal overcome us. Help us across\nsuch hostile power.\n\n3\\. And may we dive with thee across all hostile powers as across streams of\nwater.\n\n4\\. Bright, O purifier, worthy of adoration, Agni, thou shinest mightily; thou\nhast been worshipped by offerings of gh _ri_ ta [1](sbe46057.htm#an_2:7:4:1).\n\n5\\. Thou, O Bharata [1](sbe46057.htm#an_2:7:5:1), Agni! hast been worshipped\nby us with offerings of heifers, of bulls, of eight-footed (cows)\n[2](sbe46057.htm#an_2:7:5:2).\n\n6\\. The old excellent Hot _ri_ who feeds on wood and drinks butter, he is the\nwonderful son of strength.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 1 = TS. I, 3, 14, 3; MS. IV, 11, 4. Verse\n4 = TS. I, 3, 14, 5. Verse 6 = VS. XI, 70; TS. IV, 1, 9, 2; MS. II, 7, 7.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Agni Bharata is Agni as the protector of the Bharata tribe or as\ninvoked by that tribe.\n\nNote 2. With the beginning of this verse, I, 44, 4 should be compared.\n\np. 212\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VIII, 19, 22. agni _h_ gh _ri_ tebhi _h_ a\xc2\xb4huta _h_.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. See verse 1, note 1.\n\nNote 2. Roth (Petersb. Dictionary) supplies vagbhi _h_ or _ri_ gbhi _h_ ;\ncomp. VIII, 76, 12. va\xc2\xb4 _k_ am ash _t_ a\xc2\xb4padim. But there is no doubt that ash\n_t_ a\xc2\xb4padi, standing by the side of va _s_ a\xc2\xb4 and ukshan, has the same meaning\nas in the later ritual, viz. a cow with calf.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 8](sbe46058.htm)\n\n'
