 \nThe son against the father strives.  \nAnd husbands fail to rule their wives.  \nIn kingless realms no princes call  \nTheir friends to meet in crowded hall;  \nNo joyful citizens resort  \nTo garden trim or sacred court.  \nIn kingless realms no Twice-born care  \nTo sacrifice with text and prayer,  \nNor Brahmans, who their vows maintain,  \nThe great solemnities ordain.  \nThe joys of happier days have ceased:  \nNo gathering, festival, or feast  \nTogether calls the merry throng  \nDelighted with the play and song.  \nIn kingless lands it ne'er is well  \nWith sons of trade who buy and sell:  \nNo men who pleasant tales repeat  \nDelight the crowd with stories sweet.  \nIn kingless realms we ne'er behold  \nYoung maidens decked with gems and gold,  \nFlock to the gardens blithe and gay  \nTo spend their evening hours in play.  \nNo lover in the flying car  \nRides with his love to woods afar.  \nIn kingless lands no wealthy swain  \nWho keeps the herd and reaps the grain,  \nLies sleeping, blest with ample store,  \nSecurely near his open door.  \nUpon the royal roads we see  \nNo tusked elephant roaming free,  \nOf three-score years, whose head and neck  \nSweet tinkling bells of silver deck.  \nWe hear no more the glad applause  \nWhen his strong bow each rival draws,  \nNo clap of hands, no eager cries  \nThat cheer each martial exercise.  \nIn kingless realms no merchant bands  \nWho travel forth to distant lands,  \nWith precious wares their wagons load.  \n\np. 175  \n\nAnd fear no danger on the road,  \nNo sage secure in self-control,  \nBrooding on God with mind and soul,  \nIn lonely wanderings finds his home  \nWhere'er at eve his feet may roam.  \nIn kingless realms no man is sure  \nHe holds his life and wealth secure.  \nIn kingless lands no warriors smite  \nThe foeman's host in glorious fight.  \nIn kingless lands the wise no more.  \nWell trained in Scripture's holy lore.  \nIn shady groves and gardens meet  \nTo argue in their calm retreat.  \nNo longer, in religious fear,  \nDo they who pious vows revere,  \nBring dainty cates and wreaths of flowers  \nAs offerings to the heavenly powers.  \nNo longer, bright as trees in spring,  \nShine forth the children of the king  \nResplendent in the people's eyes  \nWith aloe wood and sandal dyes.  \nA brook where water once has been,  \nA grove where grass no more is green,  \nKine with no herdsman's guiding hand--  \nSo wretched is a kingless land.  \nThe car its waving banner rears,  \nBanner of fire the smoke appears:  \nOur king, the banner of our pride,  \nA God with Gods is glorified.  \nIn kingless lands no law is known,  \nAnd none may call his wealth his own,  \nEach preys on each from hour to hour,  \nAs fish the weaker fish devour.  \nThen fearless, atheists overleap  \nThe bounds of right the godly keep,  \nAnd when no royal powers restrain,  \nPre?inence and lordship gain.  \nAs in the frame of man the eye  \nKeeps watch and ward, a careful spy,  \nThe monarch in his wide domains  \nProtects the truth, the right maintains.  \nHe is the right, the truth is he,  \nTheir hopes in him the well-born see.  \nOn him his people's lives depend,  \nMother is he, and sire, nnd friend.  \nThe world were veiled in blinding night,  \nAnd none could see or know aright,  \nRuled there no king in any state  \nThe good and ill to separate.  \nWe will obey thy word and will  \nAs if our king were living still:  \nAs keeps his bounds the faithful sea,  \nSo we observe thy high decree.  \nO best of Bramans, first in place,  \n   Our kingless land lies desolate:  \nSome scion of Ikshvaku's race  \n   Do thou as monarch consecrate.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXVIII.: The Envoys.](ry146.htm)\n\n"
