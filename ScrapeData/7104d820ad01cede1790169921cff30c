XXXIV.\n\nPaun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka, a Vasudeva, assumes the insignia and style of Krishn\xcc\x81a, supported\nby the king of Ka\xc5\x9bi. Krishn\xcc\x81a marches against, and destroys them. The son of\nthe king sends a magical being against Krishn\xcc\x81a: destroyed by his discus,\nwhich also sets Benares on fire, and consumes it and its inhabitants.\n\nMAITREYA.--Of a truth the divine \xc5\x9aauri, having assumed a mortal body,\nperformed great achievements in his easy victories over \xc5\x9aakra and \xc5\x9aiva, and\nall their attendant divinities. I am now desirous to hear from you,\nillustrious sage, what other mighty exploit the humiliator of the prowess of\nthe celestials performed.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Hear, excellent Brahman, with reverent attention, an account of the\nburning of Varan\xcc\x81asi by Krishn\xcc\x81a, in the course of his relieving the burdens\nof the earth.\n\nThere was a Vasudeva who was called Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka 1, and who, though not _the_\nVasudeva, was flattered by ignorant people as the descended deity, until he\nfancied himself to be the Vasudeva 2 who had come down upon earth. Losing all\nrecollection of his real character, he assumed the emblems of Vishn\xcc\x81u, and\nsent an ambassador to the magnanimous Krishn\xcc\x81a with this message; "Relinquish,\nthou foolish fellow, the discus; lay aside all my insignia, my name, and the\ncharacter of Vasudeva; and come and do me homage; and I will vouchsafe thee\nmeans of subsistence." At which Janarddana laughed, and replied, "Go,\nmessenger, back to Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka, and say to him from me, \'I will dispatch to\nthee my emblem the discus without fail. Thou wilt rightly apprehend my\nmeaning, and consider what is to be done; for I shall come to thy city,\nbringing the discus with me, and shall undoubtedly consign it to thee. If thou\nwilt command me to come, I will immediately obey, and be with\n\np. 598\n\nthee to-morrow; there shall be no delay: and, having sought thy asylum, I will\nso provide, O king, that I shall never more have any thing to dread from\nthee.\'" So saying, he dismissed the, ambassador to report these words to his\nsovereign; and summoning Garud\xcc\x81a, mounted him, and set off for the city of\nPaun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka 3.\n\nWhen the king of Ka\xc5\x9bi heard of the preparations of Ke\xc5\x9bava, he sent his army\n(to the aid of Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka), himself bringing up the rear; and with the force\nof the king of Ka\xc5\x9bi, and his own troops, Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka, the false Vasudeva,\nmarched to meet Krishn\xcc\x81a. Hari beheld him afar off, standing in his car,\nholding a discus, a club, a mace, a scimitar, and a lotus, in his hands;\nornamented with a garland of flowers; bearing a bow; and having his standard\nmade of gold: he had also the Srivatsa mark delineated on his breast; he was\ndressed in yellow garments, and decorated with earrings and a tiara. When the\ngod whose standard is Garud\xcc\x81a beheld him, he laughed with a deep laugh, and\nengaged in conflict with the hostile host of cavalry and elephants, fighting\nwith swords, scimitars, maces, tridents, spears, and bows. Showering upon the\nenemy the shafts from his \xc5\x9aaranga bow, and hurling at them his mace and\ndiscus, he quickly destroyed both the army of Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka and that of the king\nof Ka\xc5\x9bi. He then said to the former, who was foolishly wearing his emblems,\n"Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka, you desired me by your envoy to resign to you all my insignia. I\nnow deliver them to you. Here is\n\np. 599\n\nmy discus; here I give up my mace; and here is Garud\xcc\x81a, let him mount upon thy\nstandard." Thus speaking, he let fly the discus and the mace, by which\nPaun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka was cut to pieces, and cast on the ground; whilst the Garud\xcc\x81a on\nhis banner was demolished by the Garud\xcc\x81a of Vishn\xcc\x81u. The people, beholding\nthis sight, exclaimed, "Alas! alas!" but the valiant king of Ka\xc5\x9bi, adhering to\nthe imposture of his friend, continued the conflict, till \xc5\x9aauri decapitated\nhim with his arrows, shooting his head into the city of Ka\xc5\x9bi, to the marvel of\nall the inhabitants. Having thus slain Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka and the king of Ka\xc5\x9bi, with\nall their followers, \xc5\x9aauri returned to Dwaraka, where he lived in the\nenjoyment of heavenly delights.\n\nWhen the inhabitants of Ka\xc5\x9bi saw the head of their king shot into their city,\nthey were much astonished, and wondered how it could have happened, and by\nwhom the deed could have been done. Having ascertained that the king had been\nkilled by Krishn\xcc\x81a, the son of the monarch of Ka\xc5\x9bi 4, together with the priest\nof the family, propitiated \xc5\x9aankara; and that deity, well pleased to be adored\nin the sacred place Avimukta, desired the prince to demand a boon: on which he\nprayed, and said, "O lord, mighty god, through thy favour let thy mystic\nspirit arise to destroy Krishn\xcc\x81a, the murderer of my father." "It shall be\nso," answered \xc5\x9aankara: and from out of the southern fire upsprang a vast and\nformidable female 5, like flame out of fire, blazing with ruddy light, and\nwith fiery radiance streaming amidst her hair. Angrily she called upon\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, and departed to Dwaraka; where the people, beholding her, were\nstruck with dismay, and fled for protection to Madhusudana, the refuge of all\nworlds. The wielder of the discus knowing that the fiend had been produced by\nthe son of the king of Ka\xc5\x9bi, through his adoration of the deity whose emblem\nis a bull, and being engaged in sportive amusements, and playing at dice, said\nto the discus, "Kill this fierce creature, whose tresses are of plaited\nflame." Accordingly Sudar\xc5\x9bana, the discus\n\np. 600\n\nof Vishn\xcc\x81u, immediately attacked the fiend, fearfully enwreathed with fire,\nand wearing tresses of plaited flame. Terrified at the might of Sudar\xc5\x9bana, the\ncreation of Mahe\xc5\x9bwara awaited not his attack, but fled with speed, pursued by\nhim with equal velocity, until she reached Varana\xc5\x9bi, repelled by the superior\nmight of the discus of Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nThe army of Ka\xc5\x9bi, and the host of the demigods attendant upon \xc5\x9aiva, armed with\nall kinds of weapons, then sallied out to oppose the discus; but, skilled in\nthe use of arms, he consumed the whole of the forces by his radiance, and then\nset fire to the city, in which the magic power of \xc5\x9aiva had concealed herself\n6. Thus was Varana\xc5\x9bi burnt, with all its princes and their followers, its\ninhabitants, elephants, horses, and men, treasures and granaries, houses,\npalaces, and markets. The whole of a city, that was inaccessible to the gods,\nwas thus wrapped in flames by the discus of Hari, and was totally destroyed.\nThe discus then, with unmitigated wrath, and blazing fiercely, and far from\nsatisfied with the accomplishment of so easy a task, returned to the hand of\nVishn\xcc\x81u 7.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[597:1](vp151.htm#fr_1557) From being, the commentator says, king of Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ra.\nThe Bhagavata calls him chief of the Karushas; the Padma, king of Ka\xc5\x9bi; but\nthe Bhagavata, as well as our text, makes the king of Ka\xc5\x9bi his friend and\nally.\n\n[597:2](vp151.htm#fr_1558) According to the Padma P., he propitiates \xc5\x9aiva, and\nobtains from him the insignia which constitute a Vasudeva. The different\nauthorities for this legend all use the term Vasudeva in the sense of a title.\n\n[598:3](vp151.htm#fr_1559) The Hari V. and Padma P. send Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka to\nDwaraka. According to the latter, Narada incites Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka to the\naggression, telling him he cannot be a Vasudeva till he has overcome Krishn\xcc\x81a:\nhe goes, and is killed. The former work, as usual, enters into particulars of\nits own invention. Krishn\xcc\x81a is absent on a visit to \xc5\x9aiva at Kailasa, and\nduring his absence Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka, assisted by Ekalavya, king of the Nishadas,\nmakes a night attack upon Dwaraka. They are resisted by the Yadavas under\nSatyaki and Balarama; by the former of whom Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka is repeatedly\noverthrown, and all but slain: he requires so much killing, however, that he\nis likely to obtain the victory, when Krishn\xcc\x81a conies to the aid of his\nkinsmen, and after a protracted encounter, described in language employed a\nhundred times before, kills his competitor. The whole of the sections called\nthe Kailasa Yatra, or Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s journey to Kailasa, must have been wanting in\nthe copy used by M. Langlois, as they are not included in his translation. The\nchapters of the Hari V. according to his enumeration of them are 261: my copy\nhas 316.\n\n[599:4](vp151.htm#fr_1560) The Bhagavata names him Sudakshin\xcc\x81a; the Padma,\nDan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81apani.\n\n[599:5](vp151.htm#fr_1561) A personified Kritya, a magical creation. The Padma\nhas the same. The Bhagavata makes the product of the sacrificial fire a male,\nand sends him to Dwaraka, accompanied by a host of Bhutas, Suva\'s attendant\ngoblins.\n\n[600:6](vp151.htm#fr_1562) According to the Bhagavata, the magical being\nhimself destroys Sudakshin\xcc\x81a and his priest; but Sudar\xc5\x9bana consumes the people\nand the city. The Padma ascribes the destruction of the king and all his city\nto the discus. The Hari V. closes its narrative with the death of Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka,\nand makes no mention of the destruction of Benares. The circumstance is\nalluded to in a preceding section (s. 159) by Narada, when detailing the\nexploits of Krishn\xcc\x81a.\n\n[600:7](vp151.htm#fr_1563) In this legend, again, we have a contest between\nthe followers of Vishn\xcc\x81u and \xc5\x9aiva intimated, as, besides the assistance given\nby the latter to Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81raka, Benares--Varana\xc5\x9bi or Atimukta--has been from all\ntime, as it is at present, the high place of the \xc5\x9aaiva worship. There is also\nan indication of a Vaishn\xcc\x81ava schism, in the competition between Paun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ra and\nKrishn\xcc\x81a for the title of Vasudeva, and the insignia of his divinity.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXV](vp152.htm)\n\n'
