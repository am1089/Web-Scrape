Huri enquired, "Who art thou, and where art thou\ntaking these things?" She replied, "O kind to the poor! I am the servant of\nKuns; my name is \'Hump-back,\' and I constantly rub and anoint Kuns\' body with\nsandal; and in my own mind, sing of your many excellent qualities. Through the\nglorious favour of which I have obtained a sight of you to-day; and gained the\ngreatest happiness in my present birth, and have seen the object my eyes most\nwished to see. The wish of this slave now is, with your permission, to rub you\nwith sandal." Seeing her great faith, Huri said, "Rub me with it, if it will\ngive you any pleasure." On hearing these words the humpbacked woman, with very\ngreat affection and endearment, anointed Krishnu; who, perceiving her sincere\nattachment, took compassion on her, and placing his foot on hers, and putting\nhis two fingers under her chin, caused her to jump up, and made her straight.\nOn being touched by Huri\'s hand,\n\np. 149\n\nshe became very beautiful, and said in a most supplicating manner to Krishnu,\n"O lord of favour! as through your beneficence you have made this slave\'s body\nstraight, be pleased to extend your compassion by coming to my house, and\npurifying it; and having taken repose confer happiness on your servant." Huri\ntaking hold of her hand, and smiling, replied, "Thou hast removed all my\nfatigue by rubbing me with cool sandal: thy beauty is great; and the good\nqualities of thy mind, and thy virtues are excellent. My friendship for thee\nshall be without end. After having destroyed Kuns, I will come to see thee."\nSaying these words, Krishnu went on; and the hump-backed woman, who had been\nmade straight, went home; and having filled a square place with coloured meal,\nperfumes and sweetmeats, and entertaining a firm hope of again meeting\nKrishnu, began to indulge in rejoicings.\n\nThe women of Muthoora came there, and on seeing her, were astonished, and\nsaid--"Great, very great is your good fortune, O hump-back! to whom Bruhmu has\nshown affection! What difficult act of penance have you performed, that the\nlord of cowherdesses has visited you and taken you in his arms? We, who are\nwithout bodily defects, have not seen Huri, he has had an interview with you,\nand shown you the greatest affection." The women continued talking thus,\nwhilst Krishnu went about, looking at Muthoora.\n\nWhilst they were engaged in seeing the city, Krishnu arrived with his\ncompanions at the gate, where the bow was. On seeing them approach, besmeared\nwith colours of different kinds, and in a state of intoxication, the sentinels\ncalled out angrily, "Where are you coming, you stupid villagers? go away some\ndistance off, this is the royal gate." Huri, pretending not to hear what the\nsentinels said, went straight to the spot where the bow of Muhadeo, which was\nvery large and weighty, and as long as three palm trees, was placed. On\narrival there, he immediately took it up, and, bending it with\n\np. 150\n\nease to its full extent, broke it in pieces, in the same way that an elephant\nbreaks sugar-cane in pieces.\n\nAll the sentinels of Kuns, who were guarding the bow, rushed forward and\nattacked him, but Krishnu overthrew and killed them also. On beholding these\nexploits, the inhabitants of the city began to reflect, and say fearlessly to\neach other, "Behold! the Raja, sitting in his own house, has himself invited\nhis own death; he will not escape alive from the hands of these two brothers."\nAnd having heard the crash, caused by the breaking of the bow, Kuns enquired,\nwith great terror from his people, "What had occasioned so great a noise?" In\nthe mean while, many of his attendants, who were looking on at a distance,\ncame with their heads uncovered, and called out, "By the oath of the great\nRaja! Bulram and Krishnu, by coming into the city, have caused great\ndisturbance: they have broken in pieces the bow of Shivu, and killed all the\nguards."\n\nOn hearing these words, Kuns assembled a great many powerful men, and said to\nthem, "Accompany these men, and having by artifice or force, destroyed Krishnu\nand Buldeo, bring their bodies here immediately." When Kuns had thus spoken,\nthey took their arms and weapons, and went forth to meet the two brothers.\nThey had no sooner called out to them, than the brothers killed them all. When\nHuri saw, that not a single attendant of Kuns was left, he said to Bulram Jee,\n"Brother! it is some time since we came here; we ought to return to our\nencampment, because our father Nund will be expecting us, and will be anxious\non our account."\n\nHaving thus said, Krishnu returned with Bulram and the cowherds to the\nencampment. On arriving, he said to the chief Nund, "Father! we have been to\nthe city, and seen fine games, and have shown our honorary dresses to the\ncowherds."\n\nThen Nund, looking at him, said, "Your old practices will not leave you. This\nis the habitation of the Raja Kuns, and not our own village in the forest of\nBruj. Keep my instructions, son, in minci, and do not commit any violence\nhere."\n\np. 151\n\nWhen Nund Rae had thus instructed him, Nund Lal replied, with great coaxing\nand endearment of manner, "Father! we are hungry; please give us whatever our\nmother may have sent for us to eat." Nund, at these words, produced the\ndifferent articles of food they had brought with them; and Krishnu and Buldeo,\nand the cowherds partook of them.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said,--O\ngreat king! Krishnu and all his party on their return ate their supper in the\nhighest glee, and went to sleep; whilst Kuns, having heard what Krishnu had\ndone, suffered the greatest anxiety of mind; and could not obtain any ease or\nrelaxation of his griefs, whether reclining or standing erect. His mind\nmourned, and did not communicate its griefs to any one. It is said, as the\nweevil eats into wood, and no one knows the pain the wood suffers: thus, when\nthere is anxiety in the mind, the understanding, strength and body are\ndiminished. At length, being in a state of great fear, he went into, his\nhouse, and reclined upon a bed; but he was so alarmed, that he could not\nsleep.\n\nHe remained awake during three watches of the night, when he shut his eye-\nlids, and had a moment\'s sleep. Then in a dream he saw, in imagination, the\nshadow of a body, wandering about without a head. He sometimes bathed naked\nupon the sand; and then, having eaten poison, rushed about, mounted on an ass.\nHe took up his abode in a burial ground with ghosts, wearing garlands of\nblood-red flowers. Then he saw trees all round him, on which young children\nwere sitting.\n\nO great king! when Kuns had this dream, he was in a state of such excessive\nagitation, that he awoke; and being occupied with anxious thoughts, rose up,\nand came forth; and having summoned all his ministers, said, "Go immediately,\nand have the place of amusement sprinkled over with water, and thoroughly\narranged and prepared, and invite Nund and Oopnund, and all the inhabitants of\nBruj, and Basoodeo and all the members of the family of Judoo; and invite also\nall\n\np. 152\n\nthe Rajas, who may have come here. Whilst this is being done, I will come\nalso."\n\nHaving received Kuns\' orders, the counsellors came to the place of amusement,\nand having had it thoroughly swept, and sprinkled with water, they spread\nsilken cloths; and having suspended garlands, and strings of flowers, and\nflags, and banners, and having caused musical instruments of all kinds to be\nplayed, they issued invitations to all.\n\nThey, who were invited, came and took their seats on their chairs of state. In\nthe meantime, the Raja Kuns came, filled with very great pride, and took his\nseat on a platform erected for him. The gods, at that time, seated in their\nchariots, began to look down from the sky.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XLIV](psa45.htm)\n\n'
