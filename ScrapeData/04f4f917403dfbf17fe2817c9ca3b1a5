The\n\np. 267\n\nnose, and the eye, and the tongue, and the skin, and the ear as the fifth,\nmind and understanding, these are the seven sacrificial priests separately\nstationed. Dwelling in a minute space, they do not perceive each other. Do\nyou, verily, O beautiful one! learn about these sacrificial priests, (which\nare) seven according to (their several) natures.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a's wife said:\n\nHow (is it) these do not perceive each other, dwelling (as they do) in a\nminute space? What are their natures, O venerable sir? Tell me this, O lord!\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nNot knowing the qualities (of anything) is ignorance (of it). Knowledge of the\nqualities is knowledge. And these never know the qualities of each other. The\ntongue, the eye, the ear likewise, the skin, the mind, and the understanding\nalso, do not apprehend smells, the nose apprehends them. The nose, the eye,\nthe ear likewise, the skin, the mind, and the understanding also, do not\napprehend tastes, the tongue apprehends them. The nose, the tongue, the ear\nlikewise,, the skin, the mind, and the understanding also, do not apprehend\ncolours, the eye apprehends them. The nose, the tongue, and next the eye, the\near, the understanding, the mind likewise, do not apprehend (objects of)\ntouch, the skin apprehends them. The nose, the tongue, and the eye, the skin,\nthe mind, and the understanding also, do not apprehend sounds, the ear\napprehends them. The nose, the tongue, and the eye, the skin, the ear, and the\nunderstanding also, do not apprehend doubt, the mind apprehends it. The nose,\nthe tongue, and the eye, the skin, the ear, and the mind\n\np. 268\n\nalso, do not apprehend final determination, the understanding apprehends it.\nOn this, too, they relate this ancient story,--a dialogue, O beautiful one!\nbetween the senses and the mind.\n\nThe mind said:\n\nThe nose smells not without me, the tongue does not perceive taste, the eye\ndoes not take in colour, the skin does not become aware of any (object of)\ntouch. Without me, the ear does not in any way hear sound. I am the eternal\nchief among all elements 1. Without me, the senses never shine, like an empty\ndwelling, or like fires the flames of which are extinct. Without me, all\nbeings, like fuel half dried and half moist, fail to apprehend qualities or\nobjects, even with the senses exerting themselves 2.\n\nThe senses said:\n\nThis would be true as you believe, if you, without us, enjoyed the enjoyments\n(derived from) our objects 3. If when we are extinct, (there is) pleasure and\nsupport of life, and if you enjoy enjoyments, then what you. believe is true;\nor if when we are absorbed 4, and objects are standing, you enjoy objects\naccording to their natures by the mere operation of the mind.\n\np. 269\n\n[paragraph continues] If again you think your power over our objects is\nconstant 1, then take in colours by the nose, take in tastes by the eye, take\nin smells by the ear, take in (objects of) touch by the tongue, and take in\nsounds by the skin, and also (objects of) 2 touch by the understanding. For\nthose who are powerful have no rules (to govern them); rules are for the weak.\nYou should accept enjoyments unenjoyed before; you ought not to enjoy what has\nbeen tasted. 3 (by others). As a pupil goes to a preceptor for Vedic learning,\nand having acquired Vedic learning from him, performs the directions of the\nVedic texts, so you treat as yours 4 objects shown 5 by us, both past and\nfuture 6, in sleep and likewise wakefulness. Besides, when creatures of little\nintelligence are distracted in mind, life is seen to be supported, when our\nobjects 7 perform their functions. And even after having carried on numerous\nmental operations, and indulged in dreams, a creature, when troubled by desire\nto enjoy, does run to objects of sense only. One entering upon enjoyments,\nresulting from mental operations (alone), and not connected with objects\n\np. 270\n\nof sense, (which is) like entering a house without a door\n[1](sbe0835.htm#fn_1291), always meets death, on the exhaustion of the life-\nwinds [2](sbe0835.htm#fn_1292), as a fire which is kindled (is extinguished)\non the exhaustion of fuel. Granted, that we have connexions with our\n(respective) qualities, and granted that we have no perception of each other's\nqualities; still, without us, you have no perception [3](sbe0835.htm#fn_1293),\nand so long no happiness can accrue to you.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[266:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1279) _Kh_ andogya, p. 285, and the passage there\nquoted by _S_ a _n_ kara as well as \xc3\x82nandagiri's gloss. And see, [p.\n353](sbe0856.htm#page_353) infra.\n\n[266:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1280) Viz. the part of it which specially appertains to\nspeech--the throat, &c.\n\n[266:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1281) All the na _d_ is or passages of the body, Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[266:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1282) I. e. at the navel in the form of sound., as the\nmaterial cause of all words. There and in that condition speech dwells after\ngoing through the body, as above stated. There, adds Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra,\ndevotees are to meditate on speech.\n\n[266:5](sbe0833.htm#fr_1283) This is not quite clear, but the meaning seems to\nbe, that the merit of the immovable mind consists in its unchangeability, and\nthat of speech in being the cause of variations in the movable mind by\nconveying new knowledge and new impressions. Cf. on this result, _Kh_ andogya-\nupanishad, p. 482.\n\n[266:6](sbe0834.htm#fr_1284) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, says, the last chapter\nexplained Pra _n_ ayama, and this explains Pratyahara. Pra _n_ ayama is the\nrestraint of the life-winds, Pratyahara that of the senses, according to the\nYoga philosophy (see the quotation in the commentary at Yoga-sutra III, 1, and\nsee also pp. 141-145). Cf. also Gita, [p. 61](sbe0806.htm#page_61). The\nSaptahot _ri_ -vidhana as taught in the Taittiriya-brahmana and \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka\nis to be found a few pages after the pages referred to for the Dasahot _ri_\n-vidhana at [p. 261](sbe0833.htm#page_261) supra. And the other Vidhanas also\nare to be found in the same parts of those books.\n\n[268:1](sbe0834.htm#fr_1285) Cf. Kaushitaki-upanishad, p. 93; _Kh_ andogya, p.\n297; Maitri, p. 158; and B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 284. The passages in the\nlast two works seem to be identical ones.\n\n[268:2](sbe0834.htm#fr_1286) I. e. in their respective operations.\n\n[268:3](sbe0834.htm#fr_1287) The implication, of course, is, as Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra, says, that this is not so, as what is not perceived by the senses\ncannot be the object of the mind's operations,--a proposition which reminds\none of the maxim, 'Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu,'\napparently without Leibnitz's limitation of it. Cf. Archbishop Thomson's Laws\nof Thought, p. 52.\n\n[268:4](sbe0834.htm#fr_1288) As in sleep, &c.\n\n[269:1](sbe0834.htm#fr_1289) I. e. if you can enjoy objects independently of\nthe senses, whenever you choose to perform your operations. This, says Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra meets an objection which might be made, that the mind at the\ntime stated does not desire objects.\n\n[269:2](sbe0834.htm#fr_1290) Sic in original. It comes twice.\n\n[269:3](sbe0834.htm#fr_1291) Eating what has been tasted by another is a cause\nof degradation. Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 81; Maitri, p. 103; and [p.\n363](sbe0858.htm#page_363) infra.\n\n[269:4](sbe0834.htm#fr_1292) You incorrectly attribute to yourself the quality\nof apprehending them.\n\n[269:5](sbe0834.htm#fr_1293) I. e. presented before you by us.\n\n[269:6](sbe0834.htm#fr_1294) This is not quite clear. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra\nhas, 'not past, not future;' literally, 'not come, not gone.'\n\n[269:7](sbe0834.htm#fr_1295) Viz. smell, sound, &c.; not by the mere\noperations of the mind, but by obtaining the objects, is life supported.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII](sbe0835.htm)\n\n"
