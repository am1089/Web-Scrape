On account of the term, the one measured.\n\nWe read in the Ka _th_ avalli 'The Person of the size of a thumb stands in the\nmiddle of the Self, as lord of the past and the future, and henceforward fears\nno more'; 'That Person of the size of a thumb is like a light without smoke,'\n&c. (Ka. Up. II, 4, 1; 13). And 'The Person not larger than a thumb, the inner\nSelf, is always settled in the heart of men' (Ka. Up. II, 6, 17). A doubt here\narises whether the being measured by the extent of a span be the individual\nsoul or the highest Self.--The Purvapakshin maintains the former view; for, he\nsays, another scriptural text also declares the individual soul to have that\nmeasure,\n\np. 326\n\n[paragraph continues] 'the ruler of the vital airs moves through his own\nworks, of the size of a thumb, brilliant like the sun, endowed with purposes\nand egoity' ( _S_ vet. Up. V, 7; 8). Moreover, the highest Self is not\nanywhere else, not even for the purpose of meditation, represented as having\nthe size of a thumb. It thus being determined that the being of the length of\na thumb is the individual Self, we understand the term 'Lord,' which is\napplied to it, as meaning that it is the Lord of the body, the sense-organs,\nthe objects and the instruments of fruition.--Of this view the Sutra disposes,\nmaintaining that the being a thumb long can be none but the highest Self, just\non account of that term. For lordship over all things past and future cannot\npossibly belong to the individual Self, which is under the power of karman.--\nBut how can the highest Self be said to have the measure of a thumb?--On this\npoint the next Sutra satisfies us.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 24.
