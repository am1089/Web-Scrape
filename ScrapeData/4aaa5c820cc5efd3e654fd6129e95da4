There are four orders, viz. the order of householders, the order of\nstudents, the order of ascetics, and the order of hermits in the woods. 1\n\n2\\. If he lives in all these four according to the rules (of the law), without\nallowing himself to be disturbed (by anything), he will obtain salvation. 2\n\n3\\. The duty to live in the teacher\'s house after the initiation is common to\nall of them. 3\n\n4\\. Not to abandon sacred learning (is a duty common) to all.\n\n5\\. Having learnt the rites (that are to be performed in each order), he may\nperform what he wishes.\n\n6\\. Worshipping until death (and living) according to the rule of a\n(temporary) student, a (professed) student may leave his body in the house of\nhis teacher.\n\n7\\. Now (follow the rules) regarding the ascetic (Sa _m_ nyasin).\n\n8\\. Only after (having fulfilled) the duties of that (order of students) he\nshall go forth (as an ascetic), remaining chaste. 8\n\np. 154\n\n9\\. For him (the Sa _m_ nyasin) they prescribe the following rules).\n\n10\\. He shall live without a fire, without a house, Without pleasures, without\nprotection. Remaining silent and uttering speech only on the occasion of the\ndaily recitation of the Veda, begging so much food only in the village as will\nsustain his life, he shall wander about neither caring for this world nor for\nheaven. 10\n\n11\\. It is ordained that he shall wear clothes thrown away (by others as\nuseless).\n\n12\\. Some declare that he shall go naked. 12\n\n13\\. Abandoning truth and falsehood, pleasure and pain, the Vedas, this world\nand the next, he shall seek the \xc3\x82tman. 13\n\n14\\. (Some say that) he obtains salvation if he knows (the \xc3\x82tman).\n\n15\\. (But) that (opinion) is opposed to the _S_ astras. 15\n\n16\\. (For) if salvation were obtained by the knowledge of the \xc3\x82tman alone,\nthen he ought not to feel any pain even in this (world).\n\n17\\. Thereby that which follows has been declared. 17\n\np. 155\n\n18\\. Now (follow the rules regarding) the hermit living in the woods.\n\n19\\. Only after (completing) that (studentship) he shall go forth, remaining\nchaste.\n\n20\\. For him they give (the following rules):\n\n21\\. he shall keep one fire only, have no house, enjoy no pleasures, have no\nprotector, observe silence, uttering speech on the occasion of the daily\nrecitation of the Veda only. 21\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[153:1](sbe0256.htm#fr_722) **21**. \'Though four (orders) are enumerated, he\nuses the word "four," lest, in the absence of a distinct rule of the venerable\nteacher, one order only, that of the householder, should be allowed, as has\nbeen taught in other Sm _ri_ tis.\'--Haradatta. Manu VI, 87.\n\n[153:2](sbe0256.htm#fr_723) Manu VI, 88.\n\n[153:3](sbe0256.htm#fr_724) Manu II, 247-249, and above.\n\n[153:8](sbe0256.htm#fr_725) The meaning of the Sutra is, that the studentship\nis a necessary preliminary for the Sa _m_ nyasin. If a man considers\nsufficiently purified by his life in that order, he may become a Sa _m_ nyasin\nimmediately after its completion. Otherwise he may first become a householder,\nor a hermit, and enter the last p. 154 order, when his passions are entirely\nextinct. See also Manu VI, 36; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 56-57.\n\n[154:10](sbe0256.htm#fr_726) Manu VI, 33, 42-45; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 58 seq.\n\n[154:12](sbe0256.htm#fr_727) \'Another (commentator) says, "Some declare that\nhe is free from all injunctions and prohibitions, i.e. he need neither perform\nnor avoid any (particular actions),"\'--Haradatta.\n\n[154:13](sbe0256.htm#fr_728) \'He shall seek, i.e. worship, the \xc3\x82tman or Self,\nwhich has been described in the section on transcendental knowledge (I, 8).\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[154:15](sbe0256.htm#fr_729) Haradatta apparently takes the word _S_ astras to\nmean \'Dharma _s_ astras.\'\n\n[154:17](sbe0256.htm#fr_730) \'That which follows\' are the Yogas, which must be\nemployed in order to cause the annihilation of pain, after the knowledge of\nthe \xc3\x82tman or Self has been obtained.\n\n[155:21](sbe0256.htm#fr_731) \'But which is that one fire? Certainly not the G\n_ri_ hya-fire, because he must remain chaste. Therefore the meaning intended\nis, "He shall offer a Samidh morn and evening in the common fire, just as\nformerly, (during his studentship)." Another commentator says, "Gautama\ndeclares that he shall kindle a fire according to the rule of the _S_ ramanaka\nSutra. The _S_ ramanaka Sutra is the Vaikhanasa Sutra. Having kindled a fire\nin the manner prescribed there, he shall sacrifice in it every morning and\nevery evening."\'--Haradatta. See also Manu VI, 4; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 45.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 9, Kha _n_ _d_ a 22](sbe0257.htm)\n\n'
