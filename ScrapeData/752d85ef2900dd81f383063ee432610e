Moreover (the anandamaya is Brahman because)\n\np. 68\n\nthe same (Brahman) which had been referred to in the mantra is sung, (i.e.\nproclaimed in the Brahma _n_ a passage as the anandamaya.)\n\nThe Self, consisting of joy, is the highest Brahman for the following reason\nalso 1. On the introductory words 'he who knows Brahman attains the highest'\n(Taitt. Up. II, 1), there follows a mantra proclaiming that Brahman, which\nforms the general topic of the chapter, possesses the qualities of true\nexistence, intelligence, infinity; after that it is said that from Brahman\nthere sprang at first the ether and then all other moving and non-moving\nthings, and that, entering into the beings which it had emitted, Brahman stays\nin the recess, inmost of all; thereupon, for its better comprehension, the\nseries of the different Selfs ('different from this is the inner Self,' &c.)\nare enumerated, and then finally the same Brahman which the mantra had\nproclaimed, is again proclaimed in the passage under discussion, 'different\nfrom this is the other inner Self, which consists of bliss.' To assume that a\nmantra and the Brahma _n_ a passage belonging to it have the same sense is\nonly proper, on account of the absence of contradiction (which results\ntherefrom); for otherwise we should be driven to the unwelcome inference that\nthe text drops the topic once started, and turns to an altogether new subject.\n\nNor is there mentioned a further inner Self different from the Self consisting\nof bliss, as in the case of the Self consisting of food, &c. 2 On the same\n(i.e. the Self consisting of bliss) is founded, 'This same knowledge of Bh\n_ri_ gu and Varu _n_ a; he understood that bliss is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III,\n6). Therefore the Self consisting of bliss is the highest Self.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[68:1](sbe34021.htm#fr_111) The previous proofs were founded on li _n_ ga; the\nargument which is now propounded is founded on prakara _n_ a.\n\n[68:2](sbe34021.htm#fr_112) While, in the case of the Selfs consisting of food\nand so on, a further inner Self is duly mentioned each time. It cannot,\ntherefore, be concluded that the Selfs consisting of food, &c., are likewise\nidentical with the highest Self referred to in the mantra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 16](sbe34022.htm)\n\n"
