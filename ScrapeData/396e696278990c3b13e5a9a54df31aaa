Although in middle\n\np. 44\n\nlife he looked like a boy of eighteen. Not only was his physical condition\nperfect, but through practice he had mastered eighty-four postures of the\nbody. He could bend his limbs in so astonishing a way that it seemed as if his\njoints must be unattached, while his bones were as though made of some elastic\nsubstance. Many English physicians and surgeons came to see him and were\namazed at the extraordinary positions of his limbs. They brought a skeleton\nand tried to fix its bones in the same positions, but could not do so without\nbreaking them. Afterwards they reached the conclusion that if the bones were\nonce fixed in those positions the limbs would be unfitted for any kind of\nwork. Yet the example of the Yogi openly contradicted their statements. His\nlimbs were strong and of good use to him in every possible way. He could walk,\n\np. 45\n\nlift heavy weights, and move about with absolute ease. The writer himself saw\nhim in India, and also other Hatha Yogis who could accomplish equally\nwonderful feats. The primary object of these various postures described in\nHatha Yoga is to gain control over the involuntary muscles of the body, which\nis impossible to the ordinary man. We all possess this power latent within us,\nbut the Hatha Yogis were the first to discover a scientific method by which it\ncould be developed.\n\nAll Hatha Yogis eat very little, but they can also go entirely without food\nfor days and even for months, and succeed in conquering sleep. The author knew\nof one who had not slept for twelve years, and who was nevertheless in perfect\nhealth. He has also seen a Hatha Yogi who usually ate, for instance, a piece\nof unleavened bread in twenty-four hours, and who refused to\n\np. 46\n\nwear warm clothing in the coldest winter weather, and yet who voluntarily\nworked hard as a street laborer without showing the least sign of fatigue. It\nmay seem impossible to the majority of people, who have made themselves such\nslaves to sleep and food as to imagine that if they do not sleep eight or nine\nhours out of the twenty-four and eat pounds of flesh, they cannot live. Hatha\nYogis are the living contradictions of such opinions. Perhaps the reader is\nfamiliar with the account of that Yogi who was buried alive for forty days in\nan hermetically sealed box, with a guard of English officers to watch the spot\nnight and day. During these forty days the Yogi could neither eat, sleep, nor\nbreathe, yet at their expiration he was brought back to consciousness without\nany ill effects and he lived for many years. 1\n\np. 47\n\nThen again these same Yogis who do not eat, sleep, or drink for a long period,\ncan, if they wish, eat as much as ten persons at one time without suffering\nany unpleasant consequences. Of course they do not eat any kind of meat. They\ndigest their food consciously, as it were. They claim that by a third eye they\ncan, so to speak, see what is going on in their internal organs. Why should\nthis seem incredible to us when the discovery of the Roentgen rays has proved\neverything to be transparent?\n\nSome of the Hatha Yogis have extraordinary eyesight. They can not only\nperceive objects at a great distance, but can also see clearly in complete\ndarkness, even being able to pick up a pin from the floor without the least\nglimmer of ordinary light to guide them. This will not appear so strange when\nwe remember that there is invisible\n\np. 48\n\nlight in the atmosphere of a perfectly dark room. If we can learn to use this\natmospheric light, imperceptible to the common eye, and can develop our\neyesight, there is no reason why we should not see things in the dark. The\nYogis understand this and know the method by which the power of eyesight can\nbe developed. As regards distinguishing objects at a great distance, this is\nnot so difficult to believe since we know that there are persons living, not\nYogis, who can see the moons of Jupiter without the help of any instrument.\n\nThis branch of optical science in Hatha Yoga is called in Sanskrit "Trataka"\nYoga. It teaches, among other things, how, through gazing on one object and at\nthe same time performing certain special breathing exercises, many optical\nmaladies can be cured as well as the power of sight\n\np. 49\n\nstrengthened. The authentic records of Hatha Yogis vouch for the fact that it\nproduces many beneficial effects when properly practiced under the direction\nof a competent master of Hatha Yoga.\n\nA Yogi who is expert in this science of optics can fascinate or madden another\nby his optical powers. The process of hypnotism or mesmerism verifies this\nclaim. A Yogi can likewise read the thoughts of another by looking at his\neyes; for according to the Yogi the eye is the index of the mind. Here it may\nbe asked, how do the Yogis acquire these powers? They do not get them from\noutside. These powers are dormant in every individual, and through practice\nthe Yogis bring them out. They say: "Whatever exists in the universe (the\nmacrocosm) exists also in the human body (the microcosm)." That is, the finer\nforces exist potentially in our own organism, and\n\np. 50\n\nif we study our nature carefully we shall be able to know all the forces and\nthe laws which govern the universe.\n\nHatha Yoga, again, teaches the cure of disease through breathing exercises and\nthe regulation of diet and of the general habits of the daily life. But it\ndoes not claim that physical health is the same as spirituality. On the\ncontrary, it tells us that if a healthy body were a sign of spirituality, then\nwild animals and savages who enjoy perfect health would be exceedingly\nspiritual; yet they are not, as we know. The principal idea of these Yogis is\nthat physical maladies are obstacles in the path of spiritual progress, while\na healthy body furnishes one of the most favorable conditions for the\nrealization of the highest spiritual truths in this life. Those who do not\npossess good health should, therefore, begin to practice Hatha Yoga.\n\np. 51\n\nIn the practice of Hatha Yoga strict dietetic rules must be observed. Anything\nthat is sharp, sour, pungent, or hot, like mustard, liquors, fish, flesh of\nanimals, curd, buttermilk, oil cakes, carrots, onions, and garlic should not\nbe eaten. Food, again, which, having been once cooked, has grown cold and been\nrewarmed, should be avoided; as should also excess of salt or acidity, or that\nwhich is hard to digest. Rice, barley, wheat, milk, sugar, honey, and butter\nare good for a Hatha Yogi\'s diet. The manner in which Americans live in hotels\nand boarding-houses, where the food is often unclean, is far from favorable to\nthis practice. Food cooked for hundreds of people in a restaurant cannot be\nequally good for all and may easily cause disease. Those who wish to enjoy\nperfect health must be careful about what they eat; they must also observe all\n\np. 52\n\nthe laws of hygiene regarding cleanliness of the body, fresh air, and pure\nwater. They should not live in over-heated houses; neither should they indulge\nin artificial stimulants, especially beer, wine, and coffee. The habit of\nexcessive coffee-drinking is a serious menace to the American nation. Many\npeople are already suffering from nervous prostration as a result of\nindulgence in this direction, and there are very few cases in which the\nnervous system will not be affected by it to some extent.\n\nHe who wishes to practice Hatha Yoga should first of all find a Hatha Yogi\nteacher, who has perfect control over his physical body; and having found him,\nhe should lead a life in strict accord with his instructions. He should live\nin a secluded spot and where the changes of weather are neither sudden nor\nextreme. He should\n\np. 53\n\nbe a rigid vegetarian and abstain from all kinds of drinks that stimulate the\nsystem. He should never fill the stomach with a large quantity of food. He\nshould observe the moral laws and practice absolute continence. He should\nlearn to control his senses, keep his body clean, and purify his mind by\narousing feelings of kindness and love towards all living creatures.\n\nThe beginner in this branch of Yoga should gradually conquer the different\npostures of the body and limbs. These postures are called in Sanskrit _As\nana_. There are altogether eighty-four of them described in the science of\nHatha Yoga. Each of these, when practiced with special breathing exercises,\ndevelops certain powers latent in the nerve centers and the different organs\nof the system. Another object in practicing _As ana_ is to remove the\n\np. 54\n\n[paragraph continues] _Tamas_ element which causes heaviness of the body, and\nto free the system from the effects of cold, catarrh, phlegm, rheumatism, and\nmany other diseases. Some of the exercises increase the action of the stomach\nand liver, while others regulate the activities of the other organs. Tremor of\nthe body and restlessness of the limbs, which are such frequent obstacles in\nthe way of gaining control over the mind, may easily be removed by the\npractice of _As ana_.\n\nThe reader may get an idea of the _As ana_ from the following descriptions:\n\nI. Sit cross-legged on the floor, placing the left foot on the right thigh and\nthe right foot on the left thigh, and keeping the body, neck, and head in a\nstraight line.\n\nII. After sitting in this posture, hold the right great toe with the right\nhand and the left great toe with the left hand (the hands\n\np. 55\n\ncoming from behind the back and crossing each other).\n\nIII. Sit straight on a level place, firmly inserting both insteps between the\nthighs and the calves of the legs.\n\nIV. Assuming posture No. I, insert the hands between the thighs and the\ncalves, and, planting the palms firmly on the ground, lift the body above the\nseat.\n\nV. Sitting on the floor, stretch the legs straight in front, hold the great\ntoes with the hands without bending the knees.\n\nVI. Having accomplished this posture, touch the knees with the forehead. This\n_As ana_ rouses gastric fire, makes the loins lean, and removes many diseases.\n\nVII. Holding the toes as in posture V, keep one arm extended and with the\nother draw the other toe towards your ear as you would do with the string of a\nbow.\n\nVIII. Plant hands firmly on the ground,\n\np. 56\n\nsupport the weight of the body upon the elbows, pressing them against the\nsides of the loins. Then raise the feet above the ground, keeping them stiff\nand straight on a level with the head.\n\nThis _As ana_, according to Hatha Yoga, cures diseases of the stomach, spleen,\nand liver, and all disorders caused by an excess of wind, bile, or phlegm. It\nalso increases the power of digestion.\n\nIX. Lie upon the back on the floor at full length like a corpse, keeping the\nhead on a level with the body. This _As ana_ removes fatigue and brings rest\nand calmness of mind.\n\nThe student of Hatha Yoga, having perfected himself in controlling some of\nthese postures, should next take up the breathing exercises. He should\ncarefully study the science of breathing in all its aspects. Posture No. I is\none of the easiest and best\n\np. 57\n\n[paragraph continues] _As anas_ for one who wishes to control the breath. It\nfavors a tranquil circulation and slow respiration.\n\nA beginner should first practice abdominal breathing through both nostrils,\nkeeping a measured time for inspiration and expiration. Gradually he should be\ndirected by his master to hold the breath in and out. Practicing this internal\nand external suspension of breath for a few weeks, he should next take up\nalternate breathing. He may inspire through the left nostril for four seconds\nand expire through the right for four seconds, then reverse the order,\nbreathing in through the right and out through the left. The alternate\nbreathing exercises will purify the nerves and will make the student well-\nfitted for higher breathing exercises. The student should then breathe in\nthrough one nostril for four seconds, hold the\n\np. 58\n\nbreath counting sixteen seconds, and breathe out through the other nostril\ncounting eight seconds. This exercise, if practiced regularly for three\nmonths, will generate new nerve-currents and develop the healing power that is\nlatent in the system.\n\nThe Yogi who wishes to cure organic trouble or disease of any kind, should\ncombine the higher breathing exercises with the different postures of the body\nwhich bear direct relation to the disturbed organ. He should arouse the\nhealing power stored up at the base of the spine and direct it to the diseased\npart.\n\nHatha Yoga describes various methods for cleansing the internal organs. Some\nof them are extremely beneficial to those who suffer from chronic headache, or\ncold in the head, catarrh, dyspepsia, or insomnia.\n\np. 59\n\nThe drinking of cold water through the nose removes headache or chronic cold\nin the head. A Hatha Yogi cleanses the passage between the nose and the mouth\nby passing soft cords of delicate thread through the nostrils and bringing\nthem out at the mouth. He can pass the cord through one nostril and bring it\nout through the other. This purifies the head, makes the sight keen, and\nremoves disease in the parts above the shoulders.\n\nA Hatha Yogi cleanses the alimentary canal by swallowing a long piece of fine\nmuslin three inches wide. He purges the impurities of the intestines by\ndrawing water through the opening at the lower extremity of the alimentary\ncanal. This he does with the help of breathing exercises without using any\ninstrument. Then shaking the water by the alternate exercise\n\np. 60\n\nof the rectimuscles of the abdomen, he throws out the water through the same\npassage. An expert Yogi can wash the whole of the alimentary canal by drinking\na large quantity of water and letting it pass through the opening at the lower\nextremity. Thus he becomes free from stomach or intestinal disorder. These\nexercises are especially recommended for those who are flabby, phlegmatic, or\ncorpulent.\n\nHe cures insomnia by assuming posture No. IX, at the same time taking a few\ndeep breaths and holding them after each inspiration.\n\nA Hatha Yogi can swallow his tongue. It is said that he who can swallow his\nupturned tongue is freed from old age and death, conquers sleep, hunger and\nthirst, and rises above time. The powers of a perfect Hatha Yogi are indeed\nwonderful.\n\np. 61\n\nHe can do and undo anything at his will. He is the master of all physical\nlaws.\n\nThus we see that perfect health and longevity are the immediate results of the\nHatha Yoga practices. To the real seeker after Absolute Truth, however, they\nhave small value except as they become a means of attaining superconscious\nrealization. According to him, if a man lives five hundred years and yet in\nthat time does not reach the state of God-consciousness, he is little better\nthan an oak tree which may outlast many generations and grow to great size,\nbut is in the end only an oak tree. That man, on the contrary, who dies at the\nage of thirty, having realized his oneness with Divinity, has achieved\ninfinitely more than he who possesses perfect health, longevity, psychic\npowers, or the gift of healing; for he has become a living God in this world\nand can point the way of\n\np. 62\n\nsalvation to all mankind. Therefore the exercises of Hatha Yoga should be\npracticed only so far as the earnest truth-seeker does not attain Raja Yoga,\nwhich alone will lead the soul to God-consciousness and perfect freedom.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[46:1](hby05.htm#fr_0) For fuller account see "Law of Psychic Phenomena," by\nThomas Jay Hudson, page 313.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Raja Yoga](hby06.htm)\n\n'
