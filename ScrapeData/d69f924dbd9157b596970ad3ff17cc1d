Those who do not take their stand on symbols he leads, thus Badaraya _n_\na (opines); there being no fault in the twofold relation (resulting from this\nopinion); and the meditation on that (i.e. Brahman) (is the reason of this\ntwofold relation).\n\nIt is a settled conclusion that all going has reference to the effected\nBrahman, not to the highest Brahman. Another doubt now arises here. Does that\nperson who is not a man lead to the world of Brahman all those who take their\nstand on the effected Brahman, without any difference; or only some of them?\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that all those who possess knowledge--provided that\nknowledge be not of the highest Brahman--go to the world of Brahman. For in\nSutra III,\n\np. 403\n\n[paragraph continues] 3, 31 that going was put in connexion with all the\ndifferent vidyas (of the qualified Brahmans), without any distinction.\n\nTo this the Sutrakara replies, 'Those who do not take their stand on symbols.'\nThat means: Excepting those who take their stand on symbols (i.e. who meditate\non certain things as symbolically representing Brahman), that person who is\nnot a man leads all others who take their stand (i.e. who meditate) on the\neffected Brahman, to the world of Brahman; this is the opinion of the teacher\nBadaraya _n_ a. For in acknowledging in this way a twofold relation there is\nno fault; since the argumentation as to the non-restriction of going (Sutra\nIII, 3, 31) may be understood as referring to all meditations with the\nexception of those on symbols. The words, 'and the meditation on that,' state\nthe reason for this twofold relation. For he whose meditation is fixed on\nBrahman reaches lordship like that of Brahman, according to the scriptural\nrelation, 'In whatever form they meditate on him, that they become\nthemselves.' In the case of symbols, on the other hand, the meditation is not\nfixed on Brahman, the symbol being the chief element in the meditation.--But\nscripture says also that persons whose mind is not fixed on Brahman go to it;\nso in the knowledge of the five fires, 'He leads them to Brahman' ( _Kh_. Up.\nV, 10, 2).--This may be so where we observe a direct scriptural declaration.\nWe only mean to say that where there is no such declaration the general rule\nis that those only whose purpose is Brahman go to it, not any others.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 16](sbe38317.htm)\n\n"
