After having passed through the first three orders and annihilated\npassion, he must offer an oblation to Pra _g_ apati, in which he bestows all\nhis wealth (upon priests) as fee for the performance of the sacrifice, and\nenter the order of ascetics.\n\n2\\.

(Nand.)\n\n4\\. \'This implies that he must not rejoice if he does get it, as Manu (VI, 67)\nsays.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 280\n\n10\\. He must live in an empty house.\n\n11\\. Or (he must) live at the root of a tree.\n\n12\\. He must not stay for more than one night in one village (except during\nthe rainy season).\n\n13\\. His only dress must be a small piece of cloth worn over the privities.\n\n14\\. He must set down his feet purified by looking down.\n\n15\\. He must drink water purified (by straining it) with a cloth.\n\n16\\. He must utter speeches purified by truth.\n\n17\\. He must perform acts purified by his mind.\n\n18\\.

He must not salute any one reverentially.\n\n[10. \'Empty\' means \'inhabited by no one else,\' and implies that the house in\nquestion should be situated in a dark place, difficult of access. (Nand.)\n\n11\\. \'The article va implies that he must live there alone.\' (Nand.)\n\n14, 15. Nand. assigns as the reason of both these rules, \'lest he should not\nkill some insect.\' Kulluka (on M. VI, 46) gives the same reason for the second\nrule, but the looking down, according to him, is ordained in. order that be\nmay not accidentally tread upon a hair or other impure substance.\n\n17\\. The sense of this Sutra is, that in doubtful cases he must act as his\nmind prompts him to do. (Nand.)\n\n21\\. \'The meaning is, that he must not utter a benediction when he has been\nreverentially saluted by any one. He must confine himself to saying, "O Naraya\n_n_ a." Others explain, that he must not utter a benediction in begging food.\'\n(Nand.)\n\n22\\. \'The sense is, that he must not salute any one reverentially who has\nreverentially saluted him, nor return his greeting {footnote p. 281} otherwise\nthan by saying, "O Naraya _n_ a." Others explain, that he must not make an\nobeisance in begging food.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 281\n\n23\\. Should one man chop his one arm with an axe, and another sprinkle his\nother arm with sandal, he must neither curse the one in his mind, nor bless\nthe other.\n\n24\\. He must constantly be intent upon stopping his breath, upon retention of\nthe image formed in his mind, and upon meditation.\n\n25\\. He must reflect upon the transitoriness of the passage through mundane\nexistence;\n\n26\\. And upon the impure nature of the body;\n\n27\\. And upon the destruction of beauty by old age;\n\n28\\. And upon the pain arising from diseases bodily, mental, or due to an\nexcess (of the bile, &c.)\n\n29\\. And upon (the pain arising from) the (five) naturally inherent\n(affections).\n\n30\\. On his having to dwell in an embryo, covered with everlasting darkness;\n\n[24. Nand. quotes a passage of the Yoga _s_ astra, which states that one Dhara\n_n_ a = three Pra _n_ ayamas (stoppings or regulations of the breath). A\npassage of the Garu _d_ a-pura _n_ a quoted in the Petersburg Dictionary)\nstates that one Dhara _n_ a = sixteen Pra _n_ ayamas. I have taken the term\ndhara _n_ a in its ordinary acceptation of \'retention of an idea\' (cf. Wilson,\nVish _n_ u-pura _n_ a V, 237) with regard to an analogous passage of Ya _g_\n\xc3\xb1avalkya (III, 201), which is also quoted by Nand.,\n\n28\\. According to Nand,, the particle _k_ a is used to include other diseases,\nlove, anxiety or wrath, caused by enemies, and other mental pangs.\n\n29\\. They are, ignorance, egotism, love, wrath, and dread of temporal\nsuffering (Nand., according to Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali). The particle _k_ a, according\nto Nand., is used in order to imply meditation upon the thousand births which\nman has to pass through, as stated by Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya (III, 64).]\n\np. 282\n\n31\\. And on (his having to dwell) between urine and faeces;\n\n32\\. On his having to suffer, (as an embryo,) pain from the cold and hot.\n(food and drink, which his mother happens to have taken);\n\n33, On the dreadful pain which he has to suffer, at the time of his birth,\nwhile the embryo is coming forth from the narrowness of the womb;\n\n34\\. On his ignorance and his dependency upon his (parents and other) Gurus in\nchildhood;\n\n35\\. On the manifold anxieties arising from the study of the Veda (and from\nthe other obligations of a student);\n\n36\\. And (on the anxieties arising) in youth from not obtaining the objects of\npleasure, and upon the abode in bell (ordained as punishment) for enjoying\nthem, after they have been obtained unlawfully;\n\n37\\. On the union with those whom we hate, and the separation from those whom\nwe love;\n\n38\\. On the fearful agonies of hell;\n\n39\\. And (on the agonies) that have to be suffered in the passage of the soul\nthrough the bodies of animals (and of plants).\n\n40\\. (And let him reflect thus that) there is no pleasure to be met with in\nthis never-ceasing passage of the soul through mundane existence;\n\n41\\. \'(And that) even what is called pleasure, on account of the absence of\npain, is of a transient nature;\n\n42\\. (And that) he who is unable to enjoy such pleasures (from sickness or\nsome such cause), or who is unable to procure them (from poverty), suffers\nsevere pangs.\n\np. 283\n\n43\\. He must recognise this human frame to consist of seven elements. blood,\nflesh,\n\n44\\. Those elements are, adeps, scrum of flesh, bone, marrow, and semen.\n\n45\\. It is covered with skin.\n\n46\\.

Though surrounded by a hundred pleasures, it is subject to change.\n\n49\\. Though carefully supported (by elixirs and the like), it is subject to\ndestruction.\n\n50\\. It is the stay of carnal desire, wrath, greed, folly, pride, and\nselfishness.\n\n51\\. It consists of earth, water, fire, air, and ether.\n\n52\\. it is provided with bone, tubular vessels (carrying bile and phlegm\nthrough the body), tubes (conducting the vital airs), and sinews.\n\n53\\. It is endowed with the quality of ra _g_ as (passion).\n\n54\\. It is covered with six skins.\n\n55\\. It is kept together by three hundred and sixty bones.\n\n56\\. They are distributed (as follows):\n\n57\\. The teeth together with their receptacles are sixty-four in number.\n\n[46. The particle _k_ a, according to Nand., refers to the fact that the human\nbody is defiled by the touch of impure objects.\n\n48\\. \'The meaning is that, though food and drink and other sensual enjoyments\nabound, they may cause pain as well as pleasure by producing phlegm, &c.\'\n(Nand.)\n\n51\\. \'Earth,\' i.e. the flesh and bone, &c.; \'water,\' i.e. the blood; \'fire,\'\ni. e. the digestive faculty, the eyesight, &c.; \'air,\' i. e. the five vital\nairs; \'ether,\' i. e. the space enclosed by the airs, in the mouth, in the\nbelly, &c.
