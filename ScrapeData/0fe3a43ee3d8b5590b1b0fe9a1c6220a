No such definite rule (exists) as to the fruit which is release, on\naccount of the assertions as to that condition, on account of the assertions\nas to that condition.\n\nWe have seen that in the case of persons desirous of release who rely upon the\nmeans of knowledge there exists a definite difference of result, in so far as\nthe knowledge resulting springs up either in this life or a future life\naccording to the degree of strength of the means employed. It might now be\nsupposed that there exists a similar definite difference with regard to the\nfruit characterised as final release, owing to the superior or inferior\nqualification of the persons knowing.\n\nWith reference to this possible doubt the Sutra now says, 'No such definite\nrule as to that fruit which is release.' That means: We must not suppose that\nin the case of that fruit which is release there exists an analogous definite\nrule a difference.--Why?--'On account of the assertions (by scripture about\nthat condition.' For all Vedanta-texts assert the state of final release to be\nof one kind only. The state of final release is nothing but Brahman, and\nBrahman cannot be connected with different forms since many scriptural\npassages assert it to have one nature only. Compare e.g. 'It is neither coarse\nnor fine' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 8); 'That Self is to be described by No, no' (B\n_ri_. Up. III, 9, 26); 'Where one sees nothing else' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 24, 1);\n'That immortal Brahman is before' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'This everything is\nthat Self (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 6);\n\np. 330\n\n'This great unborn Self, undecaying, undying, immortal, fearless, is indeed\nBrahman' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4. 2, 5); 'When the Self only is all this how should\nhe see another?' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15).--Moreover the means of knowledge\nmight perhaps, according to their individual strength, impart a higher (or\nlower) degree to their result, viz. knowledge, but not to the result of\nknowledge, viz. release; for, as we have explained more than once, release is\nnot something which is to be brought about, but something whose nature is\npermanently established, and is reached through knowledge. Nor does, in\nreality, knowledge admit of lower or higher degree; for it is, in its own\nnature, high only, and would not be knowledge at all if it were low. Although\ntherefore knowledge may differ in so far as it originates after a long or\nshort time, it is impossible that release should be distinguished by a higher\nor lower degree. And from the absence of difference of knowledge also there\nfollows absence of definite distinction on the part of the result of knowledge\n(viz. release). The whole case is analogous to that of the results of works.\nIn that knowledge which is the means of release there is no difference as\nthere is between works. In those cognitions, on the other hand, which have the\nqualified Brahman for its object--such as 'he who consists of mind, whose body\nis pra _n_ a'--a difference is possible according to the addition or omission\nof qualities, and hence there may be a definite distinction of results, just\nas there is between the results of actions. This is also indicated by the\npassage, 'according as they meditate on him they become.' But in meditations\non Brahman devoid of qualities it is otherwise. Thus Sm _ri_ ti also says, 'No\nhigher road is possible for any one; for they speak of inequality only where\nthere are qualities.'--The repetition of the clause on account of the\nassertions as to that condition' indicates the termination of the adhyaya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 1](sbe38262.htm)\n\n"
