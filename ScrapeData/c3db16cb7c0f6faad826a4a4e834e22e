Now (follows) the _S_ rava _n_ a ceremony.\n\n2\\. On the day of that full moon which falls under (the Nakshatra) _S_ rava\n_n_ a, after the evening Agnihotra he puts wood on the (third of the three _S_\nrauta fires, called the) Dakshi _n_ agni. One who has not set up the ( _S_\nrauta) fires, (does the same with) the sacred domestic fire.\n\n3\\. Then he procures unbroken grains, unbroken fried grains, coarsely ground\ngrains, (leaves and blossoms) of the Ki _m_ _s_ uka tree, collyrium and\n(other) salve, and \xc3\x82 _g_ ya.\n\n4\\. Having 'spread under' (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) in the (spoon called) Darvi, he cuts off\n(the Avadanas) of those kinds of food (mentioned in Sutra 3), mixes them with\nclarified butter, and sacrifices (with the formulas), 'Adoration to Agni the\nterrestrial, the lord of terrestrial beings! Svaha! Adoration to Vayu the all-\npervading, the lord of aerial beings! Svaha! Adoration to Surya, the red one,\nthe lord of celestial beings! Svaha! Adoration to Vish _n_ u, the whitish one,\nthe lord of the beings that dwell in the quarters (of the world). Svaha!'\n\n5. 5 He anoints the Ki _m_ _s_ uka (flowers and leaves) with \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, and sacrifices with (the Mantras), 'Devoured is the gadfly; devoured is thirst (?); devoured is the stinging worm.' 'Devoured is the stinging worm; devoured is thirst; devoured is the gadfly.'\n\np. 238\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Devoured is thirst; devoured is the gadfly; devoured is\nthe stinging worm.'\n\n6\\. He takes a water-pot and a handful of Darbha grass, goes forth, his face\nturned towards the east, spreads the Darbha grass out with its points towards\nthe east, and makes four Bali-offerings on that (grass) with (the formulas),\n'To the terrestrial Serpents I offer this Bali,' 'To the aerial, &c.; to the\ncelestial, &c.; to the Serpents dwelling in the quarters (of the world),' &c.\n\n7\\. Having given there collyrium and (other) salve (to the Serpents), he\nworships them with the Mantras, 'Adoration be to the Serpents' (Taitt. Sa _m_\nhita IV, 2, 8, 3).\n\n8. 8 He should take a water-pot and should at that distance in which he wishes the serpents not to approach, three times walk round his house, turning his right side towards it, and should sprinkle water round it with (the formulas), 'Beat away, O white one, with thy foot, with the fore-foot and with the hind-foot, these seven human females and the three (daughters) of the king's tribe.\n\n'Within the dominion of the white one the Serpent has killed nobody. To the\nwhite one, the son of Vidarva, adoration!\n\n'Adoration to the white one, the son of Vidarva!'\n\n9\\. Then he worships the Serpents towards the different regions, one by one\nwith (the corresponding section of) these Mantras, 'The convergent one thou\nart called, the eastern region' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. V, 5, 10, 1 seq.).\n\np. 239\n\n10\\. From that time he daily makes the Bali-offerings till the full-moon day\nof Marga _s_ irsha.\n\n11\\. Here the Ki _m_ _s_ uka offerings (see \xc2\xa7 5) are not repeated.\n\n12\\. The sprinkling (of water) round (the house) does not take place (see \xc2\xa7\n8).\n\n13. 13 The last Bali he offers with (the words), 'Going to acquit myself, going to acquit myself.'\n\nEnd of the Sixth Pa _t_ ala.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[237:5](sbe30088.htm#fr_696) I am not sure about the translation of vi _k_ ash\n_t_ i. Perhaps it is only a blunder for vit _ri_ sh _t_ i, which is the\nreading of the \xc3\x82pastambiya Mantrapa _th_ a. Comp. Winternitz, Der Sarpabali,\nein altindischer Schlangencult (Wien, 1888), p. 28.\n\n[238:8](sbe30088.htm#fr_697) Comp. Paraskara II, 14, 19.- In the first Mantra\nI read ra _g_ abandhavi _h_ ; comp. the note on Par. II, 14, 4.\n\n[239:13](sbe30088.htm#fr_698) Some authorities understand, as Mat _ri_ datta\nstates, that he should offer the Bali only with the words as they stand in the\nSutra, others prescribe the formula (comp. \xc2\xa7 6): 'To the terrestrial (aerial,\n&c.) Serpents I offer this Bali going to acquit myself, going to acquit\nmyself.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 7, 17](sbe30089.htm)\n\n"
