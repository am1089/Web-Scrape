II.\n\nDispersion of Revata\'s descendants: those of Dhrisht\xcc\x81a: those of Nabhaga.\nBirth of Ikshwaku, the son of Vaivaswata: his sons. Line of Vikukshi. Legend\nof Kakutstha; of Dhundhumara; of Yuvana\xc5\x9bwa; of Mandhatri: his daughters\nmarried to Saubhari.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Whilst Kakudmin, surnamed Raivata, was absent on his visit to the\nregion of Brahma, the evil spirits or Rakshasas named Pun\xcc\x81yajanas destroyed\nhis capital Ku\xc5\x9basthali. His hundred brothers, through dread of these foes,\nfled in different directions; and the Kshatriyas, their descendants, settled\nin many countries 1.\n\nFrom Dhrisht\xcc\x81a, the son of the Manu, sprang the Kshatriya race of Dharsht\xcc\x81aka\n2.\n\nThe son of Nabhaga was Nabhaga 3; his son was\n\np. 359\n\n[paragraph continues] Ambarisha 4; his son was Virupa 5; his son was\nPrishada\xc5\x9bwa; his son was Rathinara, of whom it is sung, "These, who were\nKshatriyas by birth, the heads of the family of Rathinara, were called\n\xc3\x81ngirasas (or sons of Angiras), and were Brahmans as well as Kshatriyas 6."\n\nIkshwaku was born from the nostril of the Manu, as he happened to sneeze 7. He\nhad a hundred sons, of whom the three most distinguished were Vikukshi, Nimi,\nand Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a. Fifty of the rest, under Sakuni, were the protectors of the\nnorthern countries. Forty-eight were the princes of the south 8.\n\np. 360\n\nUpon one of the days called Asht\xcc\x81aka 9, Ikshwaku being desirous of celebrating\nancestral obsequies, ordered Vikukshi to bring him flesh suitable for the\noffering. The prince accordingly went into the forest, and killed many deer,\nand other wild animals, for the celebration. Being weary with the chase, and\nbeing hungered, he sat down, and ate a hare; after which, being refreshed, he\ncarried the rest of the game to his father. Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, the family priest of\nthe house of Ikshwaku, was summoned to consecrate the food; but he declared\nthat it was impure, in consequence of Vikukshi\'s having eaten a hare from\namongst it (making it thus, as it were, the residue of his meal). Vikukshi was\nin consequence abandoned by his offended father, and the epithet \xc5\x9aa\xc5\x9bada (hare-\neater) was affixed to him by the Guru. On the death of Ikshwaku, the dominion\nof the earth descended to \xc5\x9aa\xc5\x9bada 10, who was succeeded by his son Puranjaya.\n\nIn the Treta age a violent war 11 broke out between the gods and the Asuras,\nin which the former were vanquished. They consequently had recourse to Vishn\xcc\x81u\nfor assistance, and propitiated him by their adorations. The eternal ruler of\nthe universe, Narayan\xcc\x81a, had compassion upon them, and said, "What you desire\nis known unto me. Hear how your wishes shall be fulfilled. There is an\nillustrious prince named Puranjaya, the son of a royal sage; into his person I\nwill infuse a portion of myself, and having descended upon earth I will in his\nperson subdue all your enemies. Do you therefore endeavour to secure the aid\n\np. 361\n\nof Puranjaya for the destruction of your foes." Acknowledging with reverence\nthe kindness of the deity, the immortals quitted his presence, and repaired to\nPuranjaya, whom they thus addressed: "Most renowned Kshatriya, we have come to\nthee to solicit thy alliance against our enemies: it will not become thee to\ndisappoint our hopes." The prince replied, "Let this your Indra, the monarch\nof the spheres, the god of a hundred sacrifices, consent to carry me upon his\nshoulders, and I will wage battle with your adversaries as your ally." The\ngods and Indra readily answered, "So be it;" and the latter assuming the shape\nof a bull, the prince mounted upon his shoulder. Being then filled with\ndelight, and invigorated by the power of the eternal ruler of all movable and\nimmovable things, he destroyed in the battle that ensued all the enemies of\nthe gods; and because he annihilated the demon host whilst seated upon the\nshoulder (or the hump, Kakud) of the bull, he thence obtained the appellation\nKakutstha (seated on the hump 12).\n\nThe son of Kakutstha was Anenas 13, whose son was Prithu, whose son was\nViswaga\xc5\x9bwa 14, whose son was \xc3\x81rdra 15, whose son was Yuvana\xc5\x9bwa, whose son was\n\xc5\x9aravasta, by whom the city of \xc5\x9aravasti 16 was founded. The son of \xc5\x9aravasta was\nVrihada\xc5\x9bwa, whose son was Kuvalaya\xc5\x9bwa. This prince, inspired with the spirit\nof Vishn\xcc\x81u, destroyed the Asura Dhundhu, who had harassed the pious sage\nUttanka; and he was thence entitled Dhundhumara 17. In his conflict with the\ndemon\n\np. 362\n\nthe king was attended by his sons, to the number of twenty-one thousand; and\nall these, with the exception of only three, perished in the engagement,\nconsumed by the fiery breath of Dhundhu. The three who survived were\nDridha\xc5\x9bwa, Chandra\xc5\x9bwa, and Kapila\xc5\x9bwa; and the son and successor of the elder\nof these was Haryya\xc5\x9bwa; his son was Nikumbha; his son was Sanhata\xc5\x9bwa; his son\nwas Kri\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa; his son was Prasenajit; and his son was another Yuvana\xc5\x9bwa 18.\n\nYuvana\xc5\x9bwa had no son, at which he was deeply grieved. Whilst residing in the\nvicinage of the holy Munis, he inspired them with pity for his childless\ncondition, and they instituted a religious rite to procure him progeny. One\nnight during its performance the sages having\n\np. 363\n\nplaced a vessel of consecrated water upon the altar had retired to repose. It\nwas past midnight, when the king awoke, exceedingly thirsty; and unwilling to\ndisturb any of the holy inmates of the dwelling, he looked about for something\nto drink. In his search he came to the water in the jar, which had been\nsanctified and endowed with prolific efficacy by sacred texts, and he drank\nit. When the Munis rose, and found that the water had been drunk, they\ninquired who had taken it, and said, "The queen that has drunk this water\nshall give birth to a mighty and valiant son." "It was I," exclaimed the Raja,\n"who unwittingly drank the water!" and accordingly in the belly of Yuvana\xc5\x9bwa\nwas conceived a child, and it grew, and in due time it ripped open the right\nside of the Raja, and was born, and the Raji, did not die. Upon the birth of\nthe child, "Who will be its nurse?" said the Munis; when, Indra, the king of\nthe gods, appeared, and said, "He shall have me for his nurse" (mam dhasyati);\nand hence the boy was named Mandhatri. Indra put his fore finger into the\nmouth of the infant, who sucked it, and drew from it heavenly nectar; and he\ngrew up, and became a mighty monarch, and reduced the seven continental zones\nunder his dominion. And here a verse is recited; "From the rising to the going\ndown of the sun, all that is irradiated by his light, is the land of\nMandhatri, the son of Yuvana\xc5\x9bwa 19."\n\nMandhatri married Vindumati, the daughter of \xc5\x9aa\xc5\x9bavindu, and had by her three\nsons, Purukutsa, Ambarisha, and Muchukunda; he had also fifty daughters 20.\n\nThe devout sage Saubhari, learned in the Vedas, had spent twelve years\nimmersed in a piece of water; the sovereign of the fish in which, named\nSammada, of large bulk, had a very numerous progeny. His children and his\ngrandchildren were wont to frolic around him in all\n\np. 364\n\ndirections, and he lived amongst them happily, playing with them night and\nday. Saubhari the sage, being disturbed in his devotions by their sports,\ncontemplated the patriarchal felicity of the monarch of the lake, and\nreflected, "How enviable is this creature, who, although horn in a degraded\nstate of being, is ever thus sporting cheerfully amongst his offspring and\ntheir young. Of a truth he awakens in my mind the wish to taste such pleasure,\nand I also will make merry amidst my children." Having thus resolved, the Muni\ncame up hastily from the water, and, desirous of entering upon the condition\nof a householder, went to Mandhatri to demand one of his daughters as his\nwife. As soon as he was informed of the arrival of the sage, the king rose up\nfrom his throne, offered him the customary libation, and treated him with the\nmost profound respect. Having taken a seat, Saubhari said to the Raja, "I have\ndetermined to marry: do you, king, give me one of your daughters as a wife:\ndisappoint not my affection. It is not the practice of the princes of the race\nof Kakutstha to turn away from compliance with the wishes of those who come to\nthem for succour. There are, O monarch, other kings of the earth to whom\ndaughters have been born, but your family is above all renowned for\nobservance. of liberality in your donations to those who ask your bounty. You\nhave, O prince, fifty daughters; give one of them to me, that so I may be\nrelieved from the anxiety I suffer through fear that my suit may be denied."\n\nWhen Mandhatri heard this request, and looked upon the person of the sage,\nemaciated by austerity and old age, he felt disposed to refuse his consent;\nbut dreading to incur the anger and imprecation of the holy man, he was much\nperplexed, and, declining his head, was lost a while in thought. The Rishi,\nobserving his hesitation, said, "On what, O Raja, do you meditate? I have\nasked for nothing which may not be readily accorded: and what is there that\nshall he unattainable to you, if my desires be gratified by the damsel whom\nyou must needs give unto me?" To this, the king, apprehensive of his\ndispleasure, answered and said, "Grave sir, it is the established usage of our\nhouse to wed our daughters to such persons only as they shall themselves\nselect from suitors of fitting rank; and since this your request is not yet\nmade known to my\n\np. 365\n\nmaidens, it is impossible to say whether it may be equally agreeable to them\nas it is to me. This is the occasion of my perplexity, and I am at a loss what\nto do." This answer of the king was fully understood by the Rishi, who said to\nhimself, "This is merely a device of the Raja to evade compliance with my\nsuit: the has reflected that I am an old man, having no attractions for women,\nand not likely to be accepted by any of his daughters: even be it so; I will\nbe a match for him:" and he then spake aloud, and said, "Since such is the\ncustom, mighty prince, give orders that I be admitted into the interior of the\npalace. Should any of the maidens your daughters be willing to take me for a\nbridegroom, I will have her for my bride; if no one be willing, then let the\nblame attach alone to the years that I have numbered." Having thus spoken, he\nwas silent.\n\nMandhatri, unwilling to provoke the indignation of the Muni, was accordingly\nobliged to command the eunuch to lead the sage into the inner chambers; who,\nas he entered the apartments, put on a form and features of beauty far\nexceeding the personal charms of mortals, or even of heavenly spirits. His\nconductor, addressing the princesses, said to them, "Your father, young\nladies, sends you this pious sage, who has demanded of him a bride; and the\nRaja has promised him, that he will not refuse him any one of you who shall\nchoose him for her husband." When the damsels heard this, and looked upon the\nperson of the Rishi, they were equally inspired with passion and desire, and,\nlike a troop of female elephants disputing the favours of the master of the\nherd, they all contended for the choice. "Away, away, sister!" said each to\nthe other; "this is my election, he is my choice; he is not a meet bridegroom\nfor you; he has been created by Brahma on purpose for me, as I have been\ncreated in order to become his wife: he has been chosen by me before you; you\nhave no right to prevent his becoming my husband." In this way arose a violent\nquarrel amongst the daughters of the king, each insisting upon the exclusive\nelection of the Rishi: and as the blameless sage was thus contended for by the\nrival princesses, the superintendent of the inner apartments, with a downcast\nlook, reported to the king what had occurred. Perplexed more than ever by this\n\np. 366\n\ninformation, the Raja exclaimed, "What is all this! and what am I to do now!\nWhat is it that I have said!" and at last, although with extreme reluctance,\nhe was obliged to agree that the Rishi should marry all his daughters.\n\nHaving then wedded, agreeably to law, all the princesses, the sage took them\nhome to his habitation, where he employed the chief of architects,\nVi\xc5\x9bwakarman, equal in taste and skill to Brahma himself, to construct separate\npalaces for each of his wives: he ordered him to provide each building with\nelegant couches and seats and furniture, and to attach to them gardens and\ngroves, with reservoirs of water, where the wild-duck and the swan should\nsport amidst beds of lotus flowers. The divine artist obeyed his injunctions,\nand constructed splendid apartments for the wives of the Rishi; in which by\ncommand of Saubhari, the inexhaustible and divine treasure called Nanda 21\ntook up his permanent abode, and the princesses entertained all their guests\nand dependants with abundant viands of every description and the choicest\nquality.\n\nAfter some period had elapsed, the heart of king Mandhatri yearned for his\ndaughters, and he felt solicitous to know whether they were happily\ncircumstanced. Setting off therefore on a visit to the hermitage of Saubhari,\nhe beheld upon his arrival a row of beautiful crystal palaces, shining as\nbrilliantly as the rays of the sun, and situated amidst lovely gardens, and\nreservoirs of pellucid water. Entering into one of these magnificent palaces,\nhe found and embraced a daughter, and said to her, as the tears of affection\nand delight trembled in his eyes, "Dear child, tell me how it is with you. Are\nyou happy here? or not? Does the great sage treat you with tenderness? or do\nyou revert with regret to your early home?" The princess replied, "You behold,\nmy father, how delightful a mansion I inhabit, surrounded by lovely gardens\nand lakes, where the lotus blooms, and the wild swans murmur. Here I have\ndelicious viands, fragrant unguents, costly ornaments, splendid raiment, soft\nbeds, and every enjoyment that affluence can procure. Why then should I call\nto memory the place of my birth? To your favour am I\n\np. 367\n\nindebted for all that I possess. I have only one cause of anxiety, which is\nthis; my husband is never absent from my dwelling: solely attached to me, he\nis always at my side; he never goes near my sisters; and I am concerned to\nthink that they must feel mortified by his neglect: this is the only\ncircumstance that gives me uneasiness."\n\nProceeding to visit another of his daughters, the king, after embracing her,\nand sitting down, made the same inquiry, and received the same account of the\nenjoyments with which the princess was provided: there was also the same\ncomplaint, that the Rishi was wholly devoted to her, and paid no attention to\nher sisters. In every palace Mandhatri heard the same story from each of his\ndaughters in reply to his questions; and with a heart overflowing with wonder\nand delight he repaired to the wise Saubhari, whom he found alone, and, after\npaying homage to him, thus addressed him: "Holy sage, I have witnessed this\nthy marvellous power; the like miraculous faculties I have never known any\nother to possess. How great is the reward of thy devout austerities!" Having\nthus saluted the sage, and been received by him with respect, the Raja resided\nwith him for some time, partaking of the pleasures of the place, and then\nreturned to his capital.\n\nIn the course of time the daughters of Mandhatri bore to Saubhari a hundred\nand fifty sons, and day by day his affection for his children became more\nintense, and his heart was wholly occupied, with the sentiment of self 22.\n"These my sons," he loved to think, "will charm me with their infant prattle;\nthen they will learn to walk; they will then grow up to youth and to manhood:\nI shall see them married, and they will have children; and I may behold the\nchildren of those children." By these and similar reflections, however, he\nperceived that his anticipations every day outstripped the course of time, and\nat last he exclaimed, "What exceeding folly is mine! there is no end to my\ndesires. Though all I hope should come to pass for ten thousand or a hundred\nthousand years, still new wishes would spring up. When I have seen my infants\nwalk; when I have beheld their youth, their manhood, their marriage, their\nprogeny; still my expectations are unsatisfied,\n\np. 368\n\nand my soul yearns to behold the descendants of their descendants. Shall I\neven see them, some other wish will be engendered; and when that is\naccomplished, how is the birth of fresh desires to he prevented? I have at\nlast discovered that there is no end to hope, until it terminates in death;\nand that the mind which is perpetually engrossed by expectation, can never be\nattached to the supreme spirit. My mental devotions, whilst immersed in water,\nwere interrupted by attachment to my friend the fish. The result of that\nconnexion was my marriage; and insatiable desires are the consequences of my\nmarried life. The pain attendant upon the birth of my single body, is now\naugmented by the cares attached to fifty others, and is farther multiplied by\nthe numerous children whom the princesses have borne to me. The sources of\naffliction will be repeatedly renewed by their children, and by their\nespousals, and by their progeny, and will be infinitely increased: a married\nlife is a mine of individual anxiety. My devotions, first disturbed by the\nfish of the pool, have since been obstructed by temporal indulgence, and I\nhave been beguiled by that desire for progeny which was communicated to me by\nassociation with Sammada. Separation from the world is the only path of the\nsage to final liberation: from commerce with mankind innumerable errors\nproceed. The ascetic who has accomplished a course of self-denial falls from\nperfection by contracting worldly attachments: how much more likely should one\nso fall whose observances are incomplete? My intellect has been a prey to the\ndesire of married happiness; but I will now so exert myself for the salvation\nof my soul, that, exempt from human imperfections, I may be exonerated from\nhuman sufferings. To that end I will propitiate, by arduous penance, Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nthe creator of the universe, whose form is inscrutable, who is smaller than\nthe smallest, larger than the largest, the source of darkness and of light,\nthe sovereign god of gods. On his everlasting body, which is both discrete and\nindiscrete substance, illimitably mighty, and identical with the universe, may\nmy mind, wholly free from sin, be ever steadily intent, so that I may be born\nno more. To him I fly for refuge; to that Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is the teacher of\nteachers, who is one with all beings, the pure eternal lord of all, without\nbeginning, middle, or end, and besides whom is nothing."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[358:1](vp094.htm#fr_949) According to the Vayu, the brothers of Raivata\nfounded a celebrated race called \xc5\x9aaryata, from \xc5\x9aaryati. The Brahma P. says\nthey took refuge in secret places (gahana); for which the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba\nsubstitutes (parvata gan\xcc\x81a) mountains. The Vayu has neither, and says merely\nthat they were renowned in all regions.\n\n[358:2](vp094.htm#fr_950) So the Vayu, Linga, Agni, Brahma, and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba.\nThe Matsya names three sons of Dhrisht\xcc\x81a, Dhrisht\xcc\x81aketu, Chitranatha, and\nRan\xcc\x81adhrisht\xcc\x81a. The Bhagavata adds, that the sons of Dhrisht\xcc\x81a obtained\nBrahmanhood upon earth, though born Kshatriyas.\n\n[358:3](vp094.htm#fr_951) But who is Nabhaga? for, as above observed, c. 1. n.\n2, the son of the Manu is Nabhaga-nedisht\xcc\x81a, and there is in that case no such\nperson as Nabhaga: on the other hand, if Nabhaga and Nedisht\xcc\x81a he distinct\nnames, we have ten sons of Vaivaswata, as in the Bhagavata. The descendants of\nNedisht\xcc\x81a, through his son Nabhaga, have been already specified; and after\nall, therefore, we must consider the text as intending a distinct person by\nthe name Nabhaga; and such a name does occur in the lists of the Agni, Kurma,\nMatsya, and Bhagavata, unquestionably distinct from that with which it is also\nsometimes compounded. The Bhagavata repeats the legend of the Aitareya\nBrahman\xcc\x81a, with some additions, and says that Nabhaga having protracted his\nperiod of study beyond the usual age, his brothers appropriated his share of\nthe patrimony. On his applying for his portion, they consigned their father to\nhim, by whose advice he assisted the descendants of Angiras in a sacrifice,\nand they presented him with all the wealth that was left at its termination.\nRudra claimed it as his; and Nabhaga acquiescing, the god confirmed the gift,\nby which he became possessed of p. 359 an equivalent for the loss of\nterritory. Most of the authorities recognise but one name here, variously read\neither Nabhaga or Nabhaga, the father of Ambarisha. The Vayu, as well as the\nBhagavata, concurs with the text.\n\n[359:4](vp094.htm#fr_952) The Bhagavata considers Ambarisha as a king, who\nreigned apparently on the banks of the Yamuna. He is more celebrated as a\ndevout worshipper of Vishn\xcc\x81u, whose discus protected him from the wrath of\nDurvasas, and humbled that choleric saint, who was a portion of \xc5\x9aiva: a legend\nwhich possibly records a struggle between two sects, in which the votaries of\nVishn\xcc\x81u, headed by Ambarisha, triumphed.\n\n[359:5](vp094.htm#fr_953) The Agni, Brahma, and Matsya stop with Ambarisha.\nThe Vayu and Bhagavata proceed as in the text, only the latter adds to Virupa,\nKetumat and \xc5\x9aambhu.\n\n[359:6](vp094.htm#fr_954) The same verse is cited in the Vayu, and affords an\ninstance of a mixture of character, of which several similar cases occur\nsubsequently. Kshatriyas by birth, become Brahmans by profession; and such\npersons are usually considered as \xc3\x81ngirasas, followers or descendants of\nAngiras, who may have founded a school of warrior-priests. This is the obvious\npurport of the legend of Nabhaga\'s assisting the sons of Angiras to complete\ntheir sacrifice, referred to in a former note, although the same authority has\ndevised a different explanation. Rathinara (or Rathitara, as read in some\ncopies, as well as by the Bhagavata and Vayu) being childless, Angiras begot\non his wife sons radiant with divine glory, who as the sons of the monarch by\nhis wife were Kshatriyas, but were Brahmans through their actual father. This\nhowever is an afterthought, not warranted by the memorial verse cited in our\ntext.\n\n[359:7](vp094.htm#fr_955) So the Bhagavata.\n\n[359:8](vp094.htm#fr_956) The Matsya says that Indra (Devarat\xcc\x81) was born as\nVikukshi, and that Ikshwaku had one hundred and fourteen other sons, who were\nkings of the countries south of Meru; and as many who reigned north of that\nmountain. The Vayu and most of the other authorities agree in the number of\none hundred, of whom fifty, with \xc5\x9aakuni at their head, are placed in the\nnorth; and forty-eight in the south, according to the Vayu, of whom Vimati was\nthe chief. The same authority specifies also Nimi and Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a as sons of\nIkshwaku, as does the Bhagavata, with the addition of their reigning in the\ncentral regions. The distribution of the rest in p. 360 that work is twenty-\nfive in the west, as many in the east, and the rest elsewhere; that is, the\ncommentator adds, north and south. It seems very probable that by these sons\nof Ikshwaku we are to understand colonies or settlers in various parts of\nIndia.\n\n[360:9](vp094.htm#fr_957) See [p. 322](vp088.htm#page_322),\n[323](vp088.htm#page_323).\n\n[360:10](vp094.htm#fr_958) The Vayu states that he was king of Ayodhya, after\nthe death of Ikshwaku. The story occurs in all the authorities, more or less\nin detail.\n\n[360:11](vp094.htm#fr_959) The Vayu says it was in the war of the starling and\nthe stork; a conflict between Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha and Viswamitra, metamorphosed into\nbirds, according to the Bhagavata; but that work assigns it to a different\nperiod, or the reign of Hari\xc5\x9bchandra. If the tradition have any import, it may\nrefer to the ensigns of the contending parties; for banners, with armorial\ndevices, were, as we learn from the Mahabharata, invariably borne by princes\nand leaders.\n\n[361:12](vp094.htm#fr_960) The Bhagavata adds, that he captured the city of\nthe Asuras, situated in the west; whence his name Puranjaya, \'victor of the\ncity:\' he is also termed Paranjaya, \'vanquisher of foes:\' he is also called\nIndravaha, \'borne by Indra.\'\n\n[361:13](vp094.htm#fr_961) Suyodhana: Matsya, Agni, Kurma.\n\n[361:14](vp094.htm#fr_962) Vi\xc5\x9bwaka: Linga. Vi\xc5\x9bwagandhi: Bhagav. Visht\xcc\x81ara\xc5\x9bwa:\nBrahma P. and Hari V.\n\n[361:15](vp094.htm#fr_963) \xc3\x81ndhra: Vayu. \xc3\x81yu: Agni. Chandra: Bhagavata.\n\n[361:16](vp094.htm#fr_964) \xc5\x9aavasta and \xc5\x9aavasti: Bhagav. \xc5\x9aravasti: Matsya,\nLinga, and Kurma, which also say that \xc5\x9aravasti was in the country of Gaura,\nwhich is eastern Bengal; but it is more usually placed in Ko\xc5\x9bala, by which a\npart of Oude is commonly understood. In my Dictionary I have inserted\n\xc5\x9aravanti, upon the authority of the Trikan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a \xc5\x9aesha, but it is no doubt an\nerror for \xc5\x9aravasti; it is there also called Dharmapattana, being a city of\nsome sanctity in the estimation of the Buddhists. It is termed by Fa-Hian,\nShe-wei; by Hwan Tsang, She-lo-va-si-ti; and placed by both nearly in the site\nof Fyzabad in Oude. Account of the Foe-kue-ki.\n\n[361:17](vp094.htm#fr_965) This legend is told in much more p. 362 detail in\nthe Vayu and Brahma Puran\xcc\x81as. Dhundhu hid himself beneath a sea of sand, which\nKuvalya\xc5\x9bwa and his sons dug up, undeterred by the flames which checked their\nprogress, and finally destroyed most of them. The legend originates probably\nin the occurrence of some physical phenomenon, as an earthquake or volcano.\n\n[362:18](vp094.htm#fr_966) The series of names agrees very well to Sanhata\xc5\x9bwa,\ncalled Varhan\xcc\x81a\xc5\x9bwa in the Bhagavata. We have there some variations, and some\ndetails not noticed in our text. The Vayu, Brahma, Agni, Linga, Matsya, and\nKurma, ascribe two sons to Sanhata\xc5\x9bwa, whom the two first name Kri\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa and\nAkri\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa, and the rest Kri\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa and Ran\xcc\x81a\xc5\x9bwa. Senajit or Prasenajit is\ngenerally, though not always, termed the son of the younger brother; but the\ncommentator on the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba calls him the son of Sanhata\xc5\x9bwa, whilst the\nMatsya, Agni, Linga, and Kurma omit him, and make Mandhatri the son of\nRan\xcc\x81a\xc5\x9bwa. The mother of Prasenajit and the wife of Akri\xc5\x9ba\xc5\x9bwa or Sanhata\xc5\x9bwa,\naccording to the different interpretations, was the daughter of Himavat, known\nas Drishadvati, the river so termed ([p. 181](vp061.htm#page_181), n.\n[7](vp061.htm#fn_403).) The wife of Yuvana\xc5\x9bwa, according to the Vayu, or of\nPrasenajit, according to the Brahma, was Gauri, the daughter of Rantinara,\nwho, incurring the imprecation of her husband, became the Bahuda river ([p.\n181](vp061.htm#page_181). n. [6](vp061.htm#fn_402)). The Brahma and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba\ncall Yuvana\xc5\x9bwa her son; but in another place the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba contradicts\nitself, calling Gauri the daughter of Matimara, of the race of Puru, the\nmother of Mandhatri; here following apparently the Matsya, in which it is so\nstated. The Brahma P. is not guilty of the inconsistency. The Vayu of course\ngives the title to Mandhatri, with the addition that he was called Gaurika,\nafter his mother. Mandhatri\'s birth from Gauri is the more remarkable, as it\nis incompatible with the usual legend given in our text and in the Bhagavata,\nwhich seems therefore to have been of subsequent origin, suggested by the\netymology of the name. In the Bhagavata, Mandhatri is also named Trasadasyu,\nor the terrifier of thieves.\n\n[363:19](vp094.htm#fr_967) The Vayu cites this same verse and another, with\nthe remark, that they were uttered by those acquainted with the Puran\xcc\x81as and\nwith genealogies.\n\n[363:20](vp094.htm#fr_968) The Brahma and Agni omit Ambarisha, for whom the\nMatsya substitutes Dharmasena. The following legend of Saubhari occurs\nelsewhere only in the Bhagavata, and there less in detail.\n\n[366:21](vp094.htm#fr_969) The great Nidhi: a Nidhi is a treasure, of which\nthere are several belonging to Kuvera; each has its guardian spirit, or is\npersonified.\n\n[367:22](vp094.htm#fr_970) Of Mamata, \'mineness;\' the notion that wives,\nchildren, wealth, belong to an individual, and are essential to his happiness.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III](vp095.htm)\n\n'
