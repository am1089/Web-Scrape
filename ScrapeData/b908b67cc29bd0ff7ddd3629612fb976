Such\njudgments as 'I know', 'Knowledge has arisen in me', show, on the other hand,\nthat we are conscious of knowledge as a mere attribute of the Self.--Moreover,\na man who suffering pain, mental or of other kind--whether such pain be real\nor due to error only--puts himself in relation to pain--'I am suffering pain'\n--naturally begins to reflect how he may once for all free himself from all\nthese manifold afflictions and enjoy a state of untroubled ease; the desire of\nfinal release thus having arisen in him he at once sets to work to accomplish\nit. If, on the other hand, he were to realise that the effect of such activity\nwould be the loss of personal existence, he surely would turn away as soon as\nsomebody began to tell him about 'release'. And the result of this would be\nthat, in the absence of willing and qualified pupils, the whole scriptural\nteaching as to final release would lose its authoritative character.--Nor must\nyou maintain against this that even in the state of release there persists\npure consciousness; for this by no means improves your case. No sensible\nperson exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself\nhas perished there will remain some entity termed 'pure light!'--What\nconstitutes the 'inward' Self thus is the 'I', the knowing subject.\n\nThis 'inward' Self shines forth in the state of final release also as an 'I';\nfor it appears to itself. The general principle is that whatever being appears\nto itself appears as an 'I'; both parties in the present dispute establish the\nexistence of the transmigrating Self on such appearance. On the contrary,\nwhatever does not appear as an 'I', does not appear to itself; as jars and the\nlike. Now the emancipated Self does thus appear to itself, and therefore it\nappears as an 'I'. Nor does this appearance as an 'I' imply in any way that\nthe released Self is subject to\n\np. 71\n\n[paragraph continues] Nescience and implicated in the Sa _m_ sara; for this\nwould contradict the nature of final release, and moreover the consciousness\nof the 'I' cannot be the cause of Nescience and so on. Nescience (ignorance)\nis either ignorance as to essential nature, or the cognition of something\nunder an aspect different from the real one (as when a person suffering from\njaundice sees all things yellow); or cognition of what is altogether opposite\nin nature (as when mother o' pearl is mistaken for silver). Now the 'I'\nconstitutes the essential nature of the Self; how then can the consciousness\nof the 'I,' i.e. the consciousness of its own true nature, implicate the\nreleased Self in Nescience, or, in the Sa _m_ sara? The fact rather is that\nsuch consciousness destroys Nescience, and so on, because it is essentially\nopposed to them. In agreement with this we observe that persons like the _ri_\nshi Vamadeva, in whom the intuition of their identity with Brahman had totally\ndestroyed all Nescience, enjoyed the consciousness of the personal 'I'; for\nscripture says, 'Seeing this the _ri_ shi Vamadeva understood, _I_ was Manu\nand the Sun' (B _ri._ Up. I, 4, 10). And the highest Brahman also, which is\nopposed to all other forms of Nescience and denoted and conceived as pure\nBeing, is spoken of in an analogous way; cp. 'Let me make each of these three\ndeities,' &c. ( _Kh._ Up. VI, 3, 3); 'May I be many, may I grow forth' ( _Kh._\nUp. VI, 2, 3); 'He thought, shall I send forth worlds?' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4, 1,\n1); and again, 'Since I transcend the Destructible, and am higher also than\nthe Indestructible, therefore I am proclaimed in the world and in the Veda as\nthe highest Person' (Bha. Gi. XV, 18); 'I am the Self, O Gu _d_ ake _s_ a.'\n(Bha. Gi. X, 20); 'Never was I not' (Bha. Gi. II, 12); 'I am the source and\nthe destruction of the whole world' (Bha. Gi. VII, 6); 'I am the source of\nall; from me proceeds everything' (Bha. Gi. X, 8); 'I am he who raises them\nfrom the ocean of the world of death' (Bha. Gi. XII, 7); 'I am the giver of\nseed, the father' (Bha. Gi. XIV, 4); 'I know the things past' (Bha. Gi. VII,\n26).--But if the 'I' (aham) constitutes the essential nature of the Self, how\nis it that the Holy One teaches the principle of egoity (aha _m_ kara) to\nbelong to the sphere\n\np. 72\n\nof objects, 'The great elements, the aha _m_ kara, the understanding (buddhi),\nand the Unevolved' (Bha. Gi. XIII, 5)?--As in all passages, we reply, which\ngive information about the true nature of the Self it is spoken of as the 'I',\nwe conclude that the 'I' constitutes the essential nature of the inward Self.\nWhere, on the other hand, the Holy One declares the aha _m_ kara--a special\neffect of the Unevolved--to be comprised within the sphere of the Objective,\nhe means that principle which is called aha _m_ kara, because it causes the\nassumption of Egoity on the part of the body which belongs to the Not-self.\nSuch egoity constitutes the aha _m_ kara also designated as pride or\narrogance, which causes men to slight persons superior to themselves, and is\nreferred to by scripture in many places as something evil. Such consciousness\nof the 'I' therefore as is not sublated by anything else has the Self for its\nobject; while, on the other hand, such consciousness of the 'I' as has the\nbody for its object is mere Nescience. In agreement with this the Reverend\nParasara has said, 'Hear from me the essential nature of Nescience; it is the\nattribution of Selfhood to what is not the Self.' If the Self were pure\nconsciousness then pure consciousness only, and not the quality of being a\nknowing subject, would present itself in the body also, which is a Not-self\nwrongly imagined to be a Self. The conclusion therefore remains that the Self\nis nothing but the knowing 'I'. Thus it has been said, 'As is proved by\nperception, and as also results from reasoning and tradition, and from its\nconnexion with ignorance, the Self presents itself as a knowing 'I'. And\nagain,'That which is different from body, senses, mind, and vital airs; which\ndoes not depend on other means; which is permanent, pervading, divided\naccording to bodies-that is the Self blessed in itself.' Here 'not dependent\non other means' means 'self-luminous'; and 'pervading' means 'being of such a\nnature as to enter, owing to excessive minuteness, into all non-sentient\nthings.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: In cases of Scripture conflicting with Perception, Scripture is not\nstronger.
