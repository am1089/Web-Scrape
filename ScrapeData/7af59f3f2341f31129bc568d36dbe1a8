Hari _h_ , Om!\n\n1\\. Suke _s_ as 1 Bharadva _g_ a 2, and _S_ aivya Satyakama, and Sauryaya _n_\nin 3 Gargya, and Kausalya 4 \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, and Bhargava Vaidarbhi 5, and\nKabandhin Katyayana, these were devoted to Brahman, firm in Brahman, seeking\nfor the Highest Brahman. They thought that the venerable Pippalada could tell\nthem all that, and they therefore took fuel in their hands (like pupils), and\napproached him.\n\n2\\. That _Ri_ shi said to them: 'Stay here a year longer, with penance,\nabstinence, and faith; then you may ask questions according to your pleasure,\nand if we know them, we shall tell you all.'\n\n3\\. Then 6 Kabandhin Katyayana approached him and asked: 'Sir, from whence may\nthese creatures be born?'\n\np. 272\n\n4\\. He replied: 'Pra _g_ apati (the lord of creatures) was desirous of\ncreatures (pra _g_ a _h_ ). He performed penance' 1, and having performed\npenance, he produces a pair, matter (rayi) and spirit (pra _n_ a), thinking\nthat they together should produce creatures for him in many ways.\n\n5 2. The sun is spirit, matter is the moon. All this, what has body and what\nhas no body, is matter, and therefore body indeed is matter.\n\n6\\. Now \xc3\x82ditya, the sun, when he rises, goes toward the East, and thus\nreceives the Eastern spirits into his rays. And when he illuminates the South,\nthe West, the North, the Zenith, the Nadir, the intermediate quarters, and\neverything, he thus receives all spirits into his rays.\n\n7\\. Thus he rises, as Vai _s_ vanara, (belonging to all men,) assuming all\nforms, as spirit, as fire. This has been said in the following verse:\n\n8 3. (They knew) him who assumes all forms, the golden 4, who knows all\nthings, who ascends highest, alone in his splendour, and warms us; the\nthousand-rayed, who abides in a hundred places, the spirit of all creatures,\nthe Sun, rises.\n\n9\\. The year indeed is Pra _g_ apati, and there are two paths thereof, the\nSouthern and the Northern. Now those who here believe in sacrifices and pious\ngifts as work done, gain the moon only as their\n\np. 273\n\n[paragraph continues] (future) world, and return again. Therefore the _Ri_\nshis who desire offspring, go to the South, and that path of the Fathers is\nmatter (rayi).\n\n10\\. But those who have sought the Self by penance, abstinence, faith, and\nknowledge, gain by the Northern path \xc3\x82ditya, the sun. This is the home of the\nspirits, the immortal, free from danger, the highest. From thence they do not\nreturn, for it is the end. Thus says the _S_ loka 1:\n\n11\\. Some call him the father with five feet (the five seasons), and with\ntwelve shapes (the twelve months), the giver of rain in the highest half of\nheaven; others again say that the sage is placed in the lower half, in the\nchariot 2 with seven wheels and six spokes.\n\n12\\. The month is Pra _g_ apati; its dark half is matter, its bright half\nspirit. Therefore some _Ri_ shis perform sacrifice in the bright half, others\nin the other half.\n\n13\\. Day and Night 3 are Pra _g_ apati; its day is spirit, its night matter.\nThose who unite in love by day waste their spirit, but to unite in love by\nnight is right.\n\n14\\. Food is Pra _g_ apati. Hence proceeds seed, and from it these creatures\nare born.\n\n15\\. Those therefore who observe this rule of Pra _g_ apati (as laid down in \xc2\xa7\n13), produce a pair, and to them belongs this Brahma-world here 4. But\n\np. 274\n\nthose in whom dwell penance, abstinence, and truth,\n\n16\\. To them belongs that pure Brahma-world, to them, namely, in whom there is\nnothing crooked, nothing false, and no guile.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[271:1](sbe15106.htm#fr_867) Suke _s_ as seems better than Suke _s_ an, and he\nis so called in the sixth Pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, in MS.
