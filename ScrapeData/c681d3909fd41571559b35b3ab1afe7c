Agni is to be invoked as the first like a father, when he has been\ninflamed by Manus [1](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:1:1) in the abode of I _d_\n[2](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:1:2). When he has invested himself with beauty, the\nwise immortal, he, the glorious strong (horse) is to be smoothed (by the\nworshippers as by grooms).\n\n2\\. Agni with bright splendour, mayest thou hear my call with all my prayers,\nthou a wise immortal. The two tawny (horses) draw thy chariot or the two red\n(horses), or He the wide-ranging one has made the two ruddy (horses draw his\nchariot) [1](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:2:1).\n\n3\\. They have generated the well-born (Agni) in her who lies on her back\n[1](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:1). Agni became a germ in the manifoldly-adorned\n(wives) [2](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:2). Even in the \xe2\x80\xa6\n[3](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:3) the wise one dwells by night uncovered in his\npowers [4](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:4).\n\n4\\. I besprinkle with my offering, with Gh _ri_ ta, Agni who abides turned\ntowards all beings, who widely extends throughout, who is mighty in his\nvigour, who shows himself most capacious by the food (which he consumes), and\nrobust [1](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:4:1).\n\n5\\. I besprinkle Him who is turned towards (us) from all sides; may he gladly\naccept that with his benevolent mind. Agni, who is like a beautiful youth, who\nhas the appearance of one eagerly striving, is not to be touched, when he\nhurries around with his body.\n\n6\\. Mayst thou know the portion (belonging to thee), being strong through thy\ndesire. With thee as our messenger may we speak like Manu. Gaining\n\np. 218\n\nwealth [1](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:6:1) I invoke with my (sacrificial) ladle,\nwith my eloquence, the faultless Agni who mixes the honey-drink.\n\n### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre. On the position of this hymn in the collection\nand its division into T _ri_ _k_ as, see the note on II, 9.--Verses 4-5 = VS.\nXI, 23-24; TS. IV, 1, 2, 4. 5; MS. II, 7, 2.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VII, 2, 3. Manuna samiddham.\n\nNote 2. \xc3\x8d _d_ is a synonym of i _d_ a; i _l_ a _h_ pade means the same as i\n_l_ aya _h_ pade.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. I cannot accept Prof. Lanman's scansion of this Pada (Noun-Inflection,\n342), uta arusha\xc2\xb4ha _k_ akre vibh _ri_ tra _h_. In my opinion the only reading\nin conformity with the use of Vedic poets is uta\xc2\xb4rusha\xc2\xb4 aha, &c.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Comp. III, 29, 3 (see below). Of course the kindling-stick is alluded\nto.\n\nNote 2. The wives are the plants.--Comp. Lanman, p. 548.\n\nNote 3. The meaning of _s_ iri _n_ a (\xe1\xbc\x85\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xce\xbe \xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbd) is unknown. The Indian\nexplanation ('night') of course is a guess, but this guess may be right.\n\nNote 4. 'Uncovered by the night,' M. M. On mahobhi _h_ , cf. vol. xxxii, p.\n197.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. See vol. xxxii, p. 212.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. There is no reason for conjecturing dhanasa\xc2\xb4m (Ludwig). Comp. X, 65,\n10. indriyam somam dhanasa\xc2\xb4 _h_ u imahe.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1](sbe46061.htm)\n\n"
