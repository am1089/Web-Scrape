A wife is not independent with respect to (the fulfilment of) the sacred\nlaw. 1\n\n2\\. Let her not violate her duty towards her husband. 2\n\n3\\. Let her restrain her tongue, eyes, and (organs of) action. 3\n\n4\\. A woman whose husband is dead and who desires offspring (may bear a son)\nto her brother-in-law. 4\n\np. 271\n\n5\\. Let her obtain the permission of her Gurus, and let her have intercourse\nduring the proper season only. 5\n\n6\\. (On failure of a brother-in-law she may obtain offspring) by (cohabiting\nwith) a-Sapi _n_ _d_ a, a Sagotra, a Samanapravara, or one who belongs to the\nsame caste. 6\n\n7\\. Some (declare, that she shall cohabit) with nobody but a brother-in-law.\n\n8\\. (She shall) not (bear) more than two (sons). 8\n\n9\\. The child belongs to him who begat it, 9\n\n10\\. Except if an agreement (to the contrary has been made). 10\n\n11\\. (And the child begotten at) a living husband's (request) on his wife\n(belongs to the husband). 11\n\n12\\. (But if it was begotten) by a stranger (it belongs) to the latter, 12\n\n13\\. Or to both (the natural father and the husband of the mother). 13\n\n14\\. But being reared by the husband, (it belongs to him.)\n\np. 272\n\n15\\. (A wife must) wait for six years, if her husband has disappeared. If he\nis heard of, she shall go to him. 15\n\n16\\. But if (the husband) has renounced domestic life, (his wife must refrain)\nfrom intercourse (with other men).\n\n17\\. (The wife) of a Brahma _n_ a (who has gone to a foreign country) for the\npurpose of studying (must wait) twelve years. 17\n\n18\\. And in like manner if an elder brother (has gone to a foreign country)\nhis younger brother (must wait twelve years) before he takes a wife or kindles\nthe domestic fire.\n\n19\\. Some (declare, that he shall wait) six years.\n\n20\\. A (marriageable) maiden (who is not given in marriage) shall allow three\nmonthly periods to pass, and afterwards unite herself, of her own will, to a\nblameless man, giving up the ornaments received from her father or her\nfamily). 20\n\n21\\. A girl should be given in marriage before (she attains the age of)\npuberty. 21\n\n22\\. He who neglects it, commits sin. 22\n\np. 273\n\n23\\. Some (declare, that a girl shall be given in marriage) before she wears\nclothes.\n\n24\\. In order to defray the expenses of a wedding, and when engaged in a rite\n(enjoined by) the sacred law, he may take money (by fraud or force) from a _S_\nudra, 24\n\n25\\. Or from a man rich in small cattle, who neglects his religious duties,\nthough he does not belong, to the _S_ udra caste, 25\n\n26\\. Or from the owner of a hundred cows, who does not kindle the sacred fire,\n\n27\\. Or from the owner of a thousand cows, who does not drink Soma.\n\n28\\. And when he has not eaten (at the time of six meals he may take) at the\ntime of the seventh meal (as much as will sustain life), not (such a quantity\nas will serve) to make a hoard, 28\n\n29\\. Even from men who do not neglect their duties.\n\n30\\. If he is examined by the king (regarding his deed), he shall confess (it\nand his condition). 30\n\n31\\. For if he possesses sacred learning and a good character, he must be\nmaintained by the (king). 31\n\np. 274\n\n32\\. If the sacred law is violated and the (king) does not do (his duty), he\ncommits sin. 32\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[270:1](sbe0282.htm#fr_1330) **XVIII**. Manu V, 155. This Sutra refers in the\nfirst instance to the inability of wives to offer on their own account _S_\nrauta or G _ri_ hya-sacrifices, or to perform vows and religious ceremonies\nprescribed in the Pura _n_ as, without the permission of their husbands. As\nthe word stri means both wife and woman, its ulterior meaning is, that women\nin general are never independent; see Manu V, 148; IX, 3; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\n1, 85.\n\n[270:2](sbe0282.htm#fr_1331) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 27, 6; Manu IX, 102.\n\n[270:3](sbe0282.htm#fr_1332) Manu V, 166; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 87.\n\n[270:4](sbe0282.htm#fr_1333) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 27, 2-3; Manu IX, 59-60; Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 68. Apati, 'she whose husband is dead,' means literally, 'she\nwho has no husband.' But as the case of a woman whose husband has gone abroad,\nis discussed below, it follows that the former translation alone is\nadmissible. It must, of course, be understood that the widow has no children.\n\n[271:5](sbe0282.htm#fr_1334) The Gurus are here the husband's relatives, under\nwhose protection the widow lives.\n\n[271:6](sbe0282.htm#fr_1335) Regarding the term Sapi _n_ _d_ a, see above,\nXIV, 13; a Sagotra is a relative bearing the same family name (laukika gotra)\nremoved seven to thirteen degrees, or still further. A Samanapravara is one\nwho is descended from the same _Ri_ shi (vaidika gotra).\n\n[271:8](sbe0282.htm#fr_1336) Colebrooke V, Digest 265. Haradatta explains\natidvitiya, 'not more than two (sons),' to mean 'not more than one son'\n(prathamam apatyam atitya dvitiyam na _g_ anayed iti). But see Manu IX, 61.\n\n[271:9](sbe0282.htm#fr_1337) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 13, 6-7.\n\n[271:10](sbe0282.htm#fr_1338) Manu IX, 52.\n\n[271:11](sbe0282.htm#fr_1339) Manu IX, 145. Such a son is called Kshetra _g_\na, see below, XXVIII, 32.\n\n[271:12](sbe0282.htm#fr_1340) Manu IX, 144.\n\n[271:13](sbe0282.htm#fr_1341) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 127. Such a son is called\ndvipit _ri_ or dvyamushyaya _n_ a.\n\n[272:15](sbe0282.htm#fr_1342) Manu IX, 76. 'When the husband has disappeared,\ni.e. has gone to a foreign country, his wife, though childless, shall wait for\nsix years. After (the lapse of) that (period) she may, if she desires it,\nproduce a child (by cohabiting with a Sapi _n_ _d_ a), after having been\nauthorised thereto by her Gurus. If the husband is heard of, i.e. that he\ndwells in such and such a country, she shall go to him.'--Haradatta. Kshapa\n_n_ a, 'waiting,' is ambiguous, and may also mean being continent or\nemaciating herself.\n\n[272:17](sbe0282.htm#fr_1343) I.e. before she goes to live with a Sapi _n_ _d_\na, or tries to follow her husband, in case his residence is known.\n\n[272:20](sbe0282.htm#fr_1344) Manu IX, 90-92; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 64.\n\n[272:21](sbe0282.htm#fr_1345) Manu IX, 88.\n\n[272:22](sbe0282.htm#fr_1346) Manu IX, 4; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 64. 'He who,'\ni.e. the father or guardian.\n\n[273:24](sbe0282.htm#fr_1347) Manu XI, 11, 13. Haradatta explains\ndharmatantra, 'a rite prescribed by the sacred law,' here, as well as Sutra\n32, by 'the means,' i.e. a sacrificial animal and the like required by one who\nis engaged in performing a sacred duty, i.e. a Pa _s_ ubandha-sacrifice and\nthe like.\n\n[273:25](sbe0282.htm#fr_1348) Manu XI, 12. 26-27. Manu XI, 14.\n\n[273:28](sbe0282.htm#fr_1349) Manu XI, 16; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 43-\n\n[273:30](sbe0282.htm#fr_1350) Manu XI, 7; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 43-44.\n\n[273:31](sbe0282.htm#fr_1351) Manu XI, 21-22. Haradatta adds that a Brahma _n_\na who acts thus, must, of course, not be punished.\n\n[274:32](sbe0282.htm#fr_1352) Haradatta refers this Sutra to the case where 'a\nsacrificial animal or other requisites for a sacrifice are stolen from a\nBrahma _n_ a. It seems, however, more probable that it refers to the duty of\nthe king to prevent, by all means in his power, a violation of the sacred duty\nto perform _S_ rauta-sacrifices, and that it is intended to prescribe that he\nis to assist a man who is engaged in them and too poor to finish them.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIX](sbe0283.htm)\n\n"
