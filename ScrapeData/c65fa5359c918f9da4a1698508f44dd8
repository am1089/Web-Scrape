Under the Phalguni (Nakshatra) marriage is celebrated.\n\n3. 3 A daughter whom he wishes to be dear (to her husband), a father should give in marriage under the Nish _t_ ya (Nakshatra); thus she becomes dear (to her husband); she does not return (to her father's) house: this is an observance based on a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n4. 4 The word Invakas means M _ri_ ga _s_ iras; the word Nish _t_ ya means Svati.\n\n5. 5 At the wedding one cow;\n\n6\\. In the house one cow:\n\n7\\. With the (first cow) he should prepare an Argha reception for the\nbridegroom as for a guest,\n\n8\\. With the other (the bridegroom [?] should do so) for a person whom he\nreveres.\n\n9\\. These are the occasions for killing a cow: (the arrival of) a guest, (the\nAsh _t_ aka sacrifice offered to) the Fathers, and marriage.\n\n10. 10 Let (the wooer) avoid in his wooing a girl that sleeps, or cries, or has left home.\n\n11. 11 And let him avoid one who has been given (to another), and who is guarded (by her relations), and one who looks wicked (?), or who is a most\n\np. 257\n\nexcellent one (?), or (who is like the fabulous deer) _s_ arabha (?), a hunch-\nback, a girl of monstrous appearance, a bald-headed girl, a girl whose skin is\nlike a frog's (?), a girl who has gone over to another family (?), a girl\ngiven to sensual pleasures (?), or a herdess, or one who has too many friends,\nor who has a fine younger sister, or one whose age is too near to that of the\nbridegroom (?).\n\n12. 12 Girls who have the name of a Nakshatra, or of a river, or of a tree, are objectionable.\n\n13\\. And all girls in whose names the last letter but one is r or l, one\nshould avoid in wooing.\n\n14\\. If possible, he should place (the following) objects hidden before the\ngirl, and should say to her, 'Touch (one of these things).'\n\n15\\. (The objects are), different kinds of seeds mixed together, loose earth\nfrom (the kind of sacrificial altar called) vedi, an earth-clod from a field,\ncow-dung, and an earth-clod from a cemetery.\n\n16. 16 If she touches one of the former (objects, this portends) prosperity as characterized (by the nature of what she has touched).\n\n17\\. The last is regarded as objectionable.\n\n18\\. Let him marry a girl of good family and character, with auspicious\ncharacteristics, and of good health.\n\n19\\. Good family, a good character, auspicious characteristics, learning, and\ngood health: these are the accomplishments of a bridegroom.\n\n20\\. A wife who is pleasing to his mind and his\n\np. 258\n\neyes, will bring happiness to him; let him pay no attention to the other\nthings: such is the opinion of some.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[255:1](sbe30096.htm#fr_726) 3, 1, 2.

The 'house' mentioned in Sutra 6 seems to be the house of the\nnewly-married couple. In the expression 'whom he reveres,' 'he,' according to\nthe commentaries, is the bridegroom.\n\n[256:10](sbe30096.htm#fr_730) This Sutra forms a half- _s_ loka.\n\n[256:11](sbe30096.htm#fr_731) Most expressions in this Sutra are quite\ndoubtful, and their translation rests on the explanations of the commentators\n(see pp. 44, 45 of Dr. Winternitz's edition), which are evidently for the most\npart only guesses.\n\n[257:12](sbe30096.htm#fr_732) 12, 13. These Sutras would require only slight\nalterations to make a _s_ loka.\n\n[257:16](sbe30096.htm#fr_733) The seeds mean offspring, and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2, 4](sbe30097.htm)\n\n"
