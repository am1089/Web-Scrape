XXXVIII.\n\nArjuna comes to Dwaraka, and burns the dead, and takes away the surviving\ninhabitants. Commencement of the Kali age. Shepherds and thieves attack\nArjuna, and carry off the women and wealth. Arjuna regrets the loss of his\nprowess to Vyasa; who consoles him, and tells him the story of Asht\xcc\x81avakra\'s\ncursing the Apsarasas. Arjuna and his brothers place Parikshit on the throne,\nand go to the forests. End of the fifth book.\n\nARJUNA having found the bodies of Krishn\xcc\x81a and of Rama, performed for them,\nand the rest of the slain, the obsequial rites. The eight queens of Krishn\xcc\x81a,\nwho have been named, with Rukmini at their head, embraced the body of Hari,\nand entered the funeral fire 1. Revati also, embracing the corpse of Rama,\nentered the blazing pile, which was cool to her, happy in contact with her\nlord. Hearing these events, Ugrasena and Anakadundubhi, with Devaki and\nRohini, committed themselves to the flames 2. The last ceremonies were\nperformed for all these by Arjuna, who then made all the people leave the\ncity, and took Vajra with him. The son of Kunti conducted the thousands of the\nwives of Krishn\xcc\x81a, with Vajra, and all the people, from Dwaraka, with\ntenderness and care, and travelled slowly away. The Sudharman palace and the\nParijata tree, which had been brought to earth by Krishn\xcc\x81a, both proceeded to\nheaven; and on the same day that Hari departed from the earth the powerful\ndark-bodied Kali age descended 3. The ocean rose, and submerged the whole of\nDwaraka, except alone the dwelling of the deity of the race of Yadu. The sea\nhas not yet been able to wash that temple away, and there Ke\xc5\x9bava constantly\nabides, even in the present day. Whoever visits that holy shrine, the place\nwhere Krishn\xcc\x81a pursued his sports, is liberated from all his sins 4.\n\np. 614\n\nThe son of Pritha, Arjuna, halted the people he had brought from Dwaraka in\nthe Panchanada country 5, in a rich and fertile spot; but the desires of the\nrobbers (of the neighbourhood) were excited, when they observed so many\nwidowed females, also such great riches, in the possession of Arjuna alone.\nInflamed by their cupidity, they assembled the villainous \xc3\x81bhiras 6, and said\nto them, "Here is this Arjuna, immensely rich, and having numerous women,\nwhose husbands have been slain, passing confidently amongst us; a disgrace to\nall brave men. His pride is raised by the death of Bhishma, Dron\xcc\x81a,\nJayadratha, Karn\xcc\x81a, and others, whom he has slain: he does not know the\nprowess of simple villagers. Up, up; take your long thick staves: this stupid\nfellow despises us. Why should we not lift up our arms?" So saying, they\nrushed, armed with cudgels and clods of earth, upon the people, who were\nwithout their lord. Arjuna encountered them, and said to them in derision,\n"Retire, wretches, ignorant of what is right, unless ye are desirous of\ndying." But they disregarded his menaces, and seized his treasures and his\nwomen, the wives of Viswaksena. Thereupon Arjuna began to brace his heavenly\nbow Gandiva, irresistible in battle; but it was in vain; for,\n\np. 615\n\nin spite of all his efforts to tighten it, it continued flaccid: neither could\nhe call to recollection the incantations of the superhuman weapons. Losing all\npatience, he launched, as best he might, his shafts upon the enemy; but those\nshot from Gandiva merely scratched the skin. The arrows given him by Agni to\ncarry certain destruction now were themselves destroyed, and were fatal to\nArjuna in his contest with herdsmen. He endeavoured to recall the might of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a; animated by which, his numerous arrows had overthrown mighty kings;\nbut he tried in vain, for now they were put aside by the peasants, or they\nflew at random, wide of their aim. His arrows being expended, he beat the\nbanditti with the horn of his bow; but they only laughed at his blows: and the\nbarbarians, in the sight of Arjuna, carried off all the women of the Vrishn\xcc\x81i\nand Andhaka tribes, and went their way 7.\n\nThen Jishn\xcc\x81u was sorely distressed, and lamented bitterly, exclaiming, Alas!\nalas! I am deserted by my lord!" and he wept: and in that instant the bow and\nheavenly arms, his car and steeds, perished entirely, like a donation to an\nunlearned Brahman. "Resistless," said he, "are the decrees of fate, by whom\nfeebleness has been inflicted upon me, deprived of my illustrious friend, and\nvictory given to the base. These two arms are mine; mine, is this fist; this\nis my place; I am Arjuna: but without that righteous aid all these are\npithless. The valour of Arjuna, the strength of Bhima, was all his work; and\nwithout him I am overcome by peasants: it cannot be from any other cause." So\nsaying, Arjuna went to the city of Mathura, and there installed the Yadava\nprince, Vajra, as its king. There he beheld Vyasa, who was living in a wood,\nand he approached the sage, and saluted him respectfully. The Muni surveyed\nhim for some time, as he lay prostrate at his feet, and said to him, "How is\nit that I see you thus shorn of your lustre? Have you been guilty of illicit\nintercourse with women, or of the death of a Brahman? or have you suffered\nsome grievous disappointment? that you are so dejected. Have your prayers for\nprogeny, or other good gifts, proved fruitless? or\n\np. 616\n\nhave you indulged improper passions? that your lustre is so dim. Or are you\none that devours the meal he has given to the Brahmans? Say, Arjuna, have you\nseized upon the substance of the poor? Has the wind of a winnowing basket\nlighted upon you? or has an evil eye gazed upon you, Arjuna? that you look\nthus miserable. Have you been touched by the water of a finger-nail? or has\nthe water of a water-jar sprinkled you? or, what is most probably the case,\nhave you been beaten by your inferiors in battle?"\n\nArjuna, having sighed deeply, related to Vyasa all the circumstances of his\ndiscomfiture, and continued; "Hari, who was our strength, our might, our\nheroism, our prowess, our prosperity, our brightness, has left us, and\ndeparted. Deprived of him, our friend, illustrious, and ever kindly speaking,\nwe have become as feeble as if made of straw. Purushottama, who was the living\nvigour of my weapons, my arrows and my bow, is gone. As long as we looked upon\nhim, fortune, fame, wealth, dignity never abandoned us: but Govinda is gone\nfrom amongst us. That Krishn\xcc\x81a has quitted earth, through whose power Bhishma,\nDron\xcc\x81a, the king of Anga, Duryodhana, and the rest, were consumed. Not I\nalone, but Earth, has grown old, miserable, and lustreless, in the absence of\nthe holder of the discus. Krishn\xcc\x81a, through devotion to whom Bhishma and other\nmighty men perished like moths in the flame of my valour, is gone; and I am\nnow overcome by cowherds. The bow Gandiva, that was famed throughout the three\nworlds, has been foiled, since he has departed, by the sticks of peasants: the\nmyriads of women over whom I was lord have been carried off from me by\nthieves, armed but with cudgels: the whole household of Krishn\xcc\x81a, O Krishn\xcc\x81a\n8, has been forcibly carried away by peasants, who with their staves have put\nmy strength to shame. That I am shorn of my lustre I do not marvel: it is\nwonderful that I live. Surely, grandsire, I alone am so shameless as to\nsurvive the stain of indignity inflicted by the vile."\n\nVyasa replied to Arjuna, and said, "Think no more, my son, of your disgrace:\nit does not become you to grieve. Know that time subjects all beings to\nsimilar vicissitude. Time effects the production and dissolution\n\np. 617\n\nof all creatures. All that exists is founded on time. Know this, Arjuna, and\nretain your fortitude. Rivers, seas, mountains, the whole earth, gods, men,\nanimals, trees, insects, are all created, and all will be destroyed, by time.\nKnowing that all that is, is the effect of time, be tranquillized. These\nmighty works of Krishn\xcc\x81a, whatever they have been, have been performed to\nrelieve earth of its burdens: for this he has come down. Earth, oppressed by\nher load, has had recourse to the assembly of the immortals; and Janarddana,\nwho is one with time, has descended on that account. This object has been now\naccomplished: all the kings of the earth are slain; the race of Vrishn\xcc\x81i and\nAndhaka is destroyed: no more remained for him to accomplish. Therefore has\nthe lord departed whither he pleased, his ends being all fulfilled. At the\nperiod of creation the god of gods creates; in that of duration he preserves;\nand at the end of all he is mighty to annihilate. Now all is done. Therefore,\nArjuna, be not afflicted by thy defeat: the prowess of mortals is the gift of\ntime. Bhishma, Karn\xcc\x81a, and other kings, have been slain by thee alone; this\nwas the work of time: and why, therefore, should not thy discomfiture, by\nthose less than thou art, occur? In like manner as through thy devotion to\nVishn\xcc\x81u these were overthrown by thee, so at last has thy defeat by miserable\nthieves been wrought by time. That divinity, assuming various bodies,\npreserves the world; and in the end the lord of creatures destroys it. In the\nbirth of thy fortunes Janarddana was thy friend; in their decline, thy enemies\nhave been favoured by Ke\xc5\x9bava. Who would have believed that thou shouldst slay\nall the descendants of Kuru, and kindred of Ganga? Who would have believed\nthat peasants should triumph over thee? Be assured, son of Pritha, that it is\nbut the sport of the universal Hari that the Kauravas have been destroyed by\nthee, and that thou hast been defeated by herdsmen. With respect to the women\nwhom thou lamentest, and who have been carried off by the thieves, hear from\nme an ancient story, which will explain why this has happened.\n\n"In former times a Brahman, named Asht\xcc\x81avakra 9, was pursuing his\n\np. 618\n\nreligious penances, standing in water, and meditating on the eternal spirit,\nfor many years. In consequence of the overthrow of the Asuras, there was a\ngreat festival on the summit of Meru: on their way to which, Rambha,\nTilottama, and hundreds and thousands of beautiful nymphs, saw the ascetic\nAsht\xcc\x81avakra, and they praised and hymned him for his devotions. They bowed\ndown before him, and eulogized him, as he was immersed up to his throat in\nwater, his hair twisted in a braid. So they sang in honour of him whatever\nthey thought would be most agreeable to that most eminent of Brahmans.\nAsht\xcc\x81avakra at last said to them, \'I am well pleased with you, illustrious\ndamsels; whatever you wish for, ask of me, and I will give it you, however\ndifficult it may be of attainment.\' Then all those nymphs, Rambha, Tilottama,\nand others, recorded in the Vedas, replied, \'It is enough for us that thou art\npleased; what need we aught else, venerable Brahman?\' But some amongst them\nsaid, \'If, exalted sir, you are indeed pleased with us, then grant us a\nhusband, the best of men, and sovereign of the Brahmans.\' \'So be it,\' replied\nAsht\xcc\x81avakra, and thereupon came up from the waters. When the nymphs beheld him\ncoming out of the water, and saw that he was very ugly, and crooked in eight\nplaces, they could not restrain their merriment, but laughed aloud. The Muni\nwas very angry, and cursed them, and said, \'Since you have been so impertinent\nas to laugh at my deformity, I denounce upon you this imprecation: through the\ngrace I have shewn unto you, you shall obtain the first of males for your\nhusband; but in consequence of my curse, you shall afterwards fall into the\nhands of thieves.\' When the nymphs heard this uttered by the Muni, they\nendeavoured to appease him; and they so far succeeded, that he announced to\nthem they should finally return to the sphere of the gods. It is in\nconsequence, then, of the curse of the Muni Asht\xcc\x81avakra that these females,\nwho were at first the wives of Ke\xc5\x9bava, have now fallen into the hands of the\nbarbarians; and there is no occasion, Arjuna, for you to regret it in the\nleast. All this destruction has been effected by the lord\n\np. 619\n\nof all; and your end is also nigh at hand, since he has withdrawn from you\nstrength, splendour, valour, and preeminence. Death is the doom of every one\nwho is born: fall is the end of exaltation: union terminates in separation:\nand growth tends but to decay. Knowing all this, wise men are susceptible of\nneither grief nor joy; and those who learn their ways are even as they are\n(equally free from pleasure or pain). Do you therefore, most excellent prince,\nunderstand this truth, and, along with your brothers, relinquish every thing,\nand repair to the holy forest. Go now, and say from me to Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira, that\nhe to-morrow, with his brethren, tread the path of heroes."\n\nThus instructed by Vyasa, Arjuna went and related to the other sons of Pritha\nall that be had seen, had experienced, and had heard. When he had communicated\nto them the message of Vyasa, the sons of Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u placed Parikshit on the\nthrone, and went to the forest.\n\nI have thus narrated to you, Maitreya, in detail, the actions of Vasudeva,\nwhen he was born in the race of Yadu.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[613:1](vp155.htm#fr_1584) The Mahabharata takes the wives of Krishn\xcc\x81a first\nto Indraprastha, and there Rukmini and four others burn; but Satyabhama and\nothers become ascetics, going to perform Tapasya in the forest.\n\n[613:2](vp155.htm#fr_1585) It is merely said in the Mahabharata that Vasudeva\nexpired; on which four of his wives burnt themselves.\n\n[613:3](vp155.htm#fr_1586) The Kali age commenced from the death of Krishn\xcc\x81a,\naccording to the usual notions; but it is commonly supposed to commence a\nlittle later, or with the reign of Parikshit.\n\n[613:4](vp155.htm#fr_1587) The Bhagavata agrees with the text in p. 614\nexcepting the temple of Dwaraka, and asserting that it still remains, in\ndirect contradiction of the Mahabharata, which declares that the sea did not\nspare any part whatever. It is clear, therefore, that when the latter was\ncompiled the temple was not standing, and that it was erected between the date\nof the compilation and that of the two Puran\xcc\x81as. The present shrine, which is\nheld in great repute, stands at the extremity of the peninsula of Guzerat. It\nis still an object of pilgrimage; it was so in the reign of Akbar (Ayin\nAkbari); and has been so, no doubt, from a remote period. The image formerly\nworshipped there was carried off 600 years ago, and this was most probably\nsubsequent to the date of both the Puran\xcc\x81as; for the idol was a form of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, called Ran\xcc\x81a chor, a popular divinity, unknown in the Pauran\xcc\x81ik\npantheon. Another image was substituted in place of that which was taken away.\nNotwithstanding the testimony of our text, and that of the Bhagavata, the\noriginality of the temple is disputed, and a place thirty miles south from\nPurbandar is said to be the spot where Dwaraka was swallowed up by the ocean.\nHamilton, from Macmurdo, &c. I. 662.\n\n[614:5](vp155.htm#fr_1588) \'The country of the five rivers,\' the Panjab:\nrather an out of the way route from Dwaraka to [Delhi](errata.htm#28).\n\n[614:6](vp155.htm#fr_1589) \xc3\x81bhiras mean \'herds,\' and they are afterwards\ncalled by Arjuna, Gopalas, \'herdsmen\' The pastoral tribes of the west of\nIndia, and particularly those of Afghanistan, almost always combine the\ncharacter of freebooter with that of shepherd.\n\n[615:7](vp155.htm#fr_1590) The principal wives of Krishn\xcc\x81a, however, according\nto the Mahabharata, escaped. The occurrence is described there much in the\nsame way, but more briefly. It is not detailed in the Bhagavata.\n\n[616:8](vp155.htm#fr_1591) A name of Vyasa.\n\n[617:9](vp155.htm#fr_1592) The story of Asht\xcc\x81avakra is related in the\nMahabharata. He was the son of Kahora, who neglecting his wife, was rebuked\nfor it by his yet unborn son. The p. 610 father angrily cursed him, that he\nshould be born bent in every part; and he was accordingly brought forth\ncrooked (vakra) in eight limbs (asht\xcc\x81a). He became nevertheless a celebrated\nsage. See also Hindu Theatre, I. 293, note.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter I](vp156.htm)\n\n'
