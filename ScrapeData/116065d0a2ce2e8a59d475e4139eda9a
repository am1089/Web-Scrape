This is the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\nThe oleander on his brow,  \nIn headsmen\'s hands you see him now;  \nLike a lamp whose oil runs nearly dry,  \nHis light fades gently, ere it die.2\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Gloomily_.]\n\nMy body wet by tear-drops falling, falling;  \nMy limbs polluted by the clinging mud;  \nFlowers from the graveyard torn, my wreath appalling;  \nFor ghastly sacrifice hoarse ravens calling,  \nAnd for the fragrant incense of my blood.3\n\n_Headsmen_. Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way!\n\nWhy gaze upon the good man so?  \nThe ax of death soon lays him low.  \nYet good men once sought shelter free,  \nLike birds, upon this kindly tree.4\n\nCome, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, come!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Incalculable are the ways of human destiny, that I am come to\nsuch a plight!\n\nRed marks of hands in sandal paste  \nO\xc2\x92er all my body have been placed; p. 154  \nThe man, with meal and powder strewn,  \nIs now to beast of offering grown.5\n\n[ _He gazes intently before him_.] Alas for human differences! [\n_Mournfully_.]\n\nFor when they see the fate that I must brave,  \nWith tears for death\'s poor victim freely given,  \nThe citizens cry "shame," yet cannot save,\xc2\x97  \nCan only pray that I attain to heaven.6\n\n_Headsmen_. Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way! Why do you gaze upon\nhim?\n\nGod Indra moving through the sky, 1  \nThe calving cow, the falling star,  \nThe good man when he needs must die,\xc2\x97  \nThese four behold not from afar.7\n\n_Goha_. Look, Ah\xc4\xabnta! Look, man!\n\nWhile he, of citizens the best,  \nGoes to his death at fate\'s behest,  \nDoes heaven thus weep that he must die?  \nDoes lightning paint the cloudless sky?8\n\n_Ah \xc4\xabnta_. Goha, man,\n\nThe heaven weeps not that he must die,  \nNor lightning paints the cloudless sky;  \nYet streams are falling constantly  \nFrom many a woman\'s clouded eye.9\n\nAnd again:\n\nWhile this poor victim to his death is led,  \nNo man nor woman here but sorely weeps;  \nAnd so the dust, by countless tear-drops fed,  \nThus peacefully upon the highway sleeps.10\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Gazes intently. Mournfully_.]\n\nThese women, in their palaces who stay,  \n  From half-shut windows peering, thus lament, p. 155  \n"Alas for Ch\xc4\x81rudatta! Woe the day!"  \n  And pity-streaming eyes on me are bent.11\n\n_Headsmen_. Come, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, come! Here is the place of proclamation. Beat\nthe drum and proclaim the sentence.\n\nListen, good people, listen! This is the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, son of S\xc4\x81garadatta,\nand grandson of the merchant Vinayadatta. This malefactor enticed the\ncourtezan Vasantasen\xc4\x81 into the deserted old garden Pushpakaranda, and for a\nmere trifle murdered her by strangling. He was taken with the booty, and\nconfessed his guilt. Therefore are we under orders from King P\xc4\x81laka to execute\nhim. And if any other commit such a crime, accursed in this world and the\nnext, him too King P\xc4\x81laka condemns to the like punishment.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Despondently. Aside_.]\n\nBy hundred sacrifices purified,  \n     My radiant name  \nWas once proclaimed by countless altars\xc2\x92 side,  \n     And knew no blame.  \nNow comes my hour of death, and evil men  \n     Of baser fame  \nIn public spots proclaim it once again,  \n     But linked with shame.12\n\n[ _He looks up and stops his ears_.] Vasantasen\xc4\x81! Oh, my beloved!\n\nFrom thy dear lips, that vied with coral\'s red,  \n  Betraying teeth more bright than moonbeams fair,  \nMy soul with heaven\'s nectar once was fed.  \nHow can I, helpless, taste that poison dread,  \n  To drink shame\'s poisoned cup how can I bear?13\n\n_Headsmen_. Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way!\n\nThis treasure-house, with pearls of virtue stored,  \n  This bridge for good men o\xc2\x92er misfortune\'s river,  \nThis gem now robbed of all its golden hoard,  \n  Departs our town to-day, departs forever.14\n\nAnd again:\n\np. 156\n\nWhom fortune favors, find  \nThat all the world is kind;  \nWhose happy days are ended,  \nAre rarely thus befriended.15\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Looks about him_.]\n\nTheir faces with their garments\xc2\x92 hem now hiding,  \n  They stand afar, whom once I counted friends:  \nEven foes have smiles for men with Fortune biding;  \n  But friends prove faithless when good fortune ends.16\n\n_Headsmen_. They are out of the way. The street is cleared. Lead on the\ncondemned criminal.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Sighing_.]\n\nMy friend Maitreya! Oh, this cruel blow!  \n  My wife, thou issue of a spotless strain!  \nMy Rohasena! Here am I, laid low  \nBy sternest fate; and thou, thou dost not know  \n  That all thy childish games are played in vain.  \n  Thou playest, heedless of another\'s pain!(ix. 29)\n\n_Voices behind the scenes_. My father! Oh, my friend!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Listens. Mournfully_.] You are a leader in your own caste. I\nwould beg a favor at your hands.\n\n_Headsmen_. From our hands you would receive a favor?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Heaven forbid! Yet a headsman is neither so wanton nor so cruel\nas King P\xc4\x81laka. That I may be happy in the other world, I ask to see the face\nof my son.\n\n_Headsmen_. So be it.\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. My father! oh, my father! [ _Ch \xc4\x81rudatta hears\nthe words, and mournfully repeats his request_.]\n\n_Headsmen_. Citizens, make way a moment. Let the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta look upon\nthe face of his son. [ _Turning to the back of the stage_.] This way, sir!\nCome on, little boy!\n\np. 157\n\n[ _Enter Maitreya, with Rohasena_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Make haste, my boy, make haste! Your father is being led to his\ndeath.\n\n_Rohasena_. My father! oh, my father!\n\n_Maitreya_. Oh, my friend! Where must I behold you now?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Perceives ins son and his friend_.] Alas, my son! Alas,\nMaitreya! [ _Mournfully_.] Ah, woe is me!\n\nLong, too long, shall I thirst in vain  \n  Through all my sojourn dread;  \nThis vessel 1 small will not contain  \n  The water for the dead.17\n\nWhat may I give my son? [ _He looks at himself, and perceives the sacrificial\ncord_.] Ah, this at least is mine.\n\nThe precious cord that Brahmans hold  \nIs unadorned with pearls and gold;  \n  Yet, girt therewith, they sacrifice  \nTo gods above and fathers 2 old.18\n\n[ _He gives Rohasena the cord_.]\n\n_Goha_. Come, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta! Come, man!\n\n_Ah \xc4\xabnta_. Man, do you name the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s name, and forget the title?\nRemember:\n\nIn happy hours, in death, by night, by day,  \nRoving as free as a yet unbroken colt,  \nFate wanders on her unrestricted way.19\n\nAnd again:\n\nLife will depart his body soon;  \nShall our reproaches bow his head?  \nAlthough eclipse may seize the moon,  \nWe worship while it seems but dead.20\n\n_Rohasena_. Oh, headsmen, where are you leading my father?\n\np. 158\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. My darling,\n\nAbout my neck I needs must wear  \n  The oleander-wreath;  \nUpon my shoulder I must bear  \nThe stake, and in my heart the care  \n  Of near-approaching death.  \nI go to-day to meet a dastard\'s ending,  \nA victim, at the fatal altar bending.21\n\n_Goha_. My boy,\n\nNot we the headsmen are,  \n  Though born of headsman race;  \nThy father\'s life who mar,  \n  These, these are headsmen base.22\n\n_Rohasena_. Then why do you murder my father?\n\n_Goha_. Bless you, \xc2\x92tis the king\'s orders must bear the blame, not we.\n\n_Rohasena_. Kill me, and let father go free.\n\n_Goha_. Bless you, may you live long for saying that!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Tearfully embracing his son_.]\n\nThis treasure\xc2\x97love\xc2\x97this taste of heaven,  \nTo rich and poor alike is given;  \nThan sandal better, or than balm,  \nTo soothe the heart and give it calm.23\n\nAbout my neck I needs must wear  \nThe oleander-wreath,  \nUpon my shoulder I must bear  \nThe stake, and in my heart the care  \nOf near-approaching death.  \nI go to-day to meet a dastard\'s ending,  \nA victim, at the fatal altar bending.(21)\n\n[ _He looks about. Aside_.]\n\nTheir faces with their garments\xc2\x92 hem now hiding,  \nThey stand afar, whom once I counted friends: p. 159  \nEven foes have smiles(16)\n\n_Maitreya_. My good men, let my dear friend Ch\xc4\x81rudatta go free, and kill me\ninstead.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Heaven forbid! [ _He looks about. Aside_.] Now I understand.\n\n                       for men with Fortune biding;  \nBut friends prove faithless when good fortune ends.(16)\n\n[ _Aloud_.]\n\nThese women, in their palaces who stay,  \n  From half-shut windows peering, thus lament,  \n"Alas for Ch\xc4\x81rudatta) Woe the day!"  \n  And pity-streaming eyes on me are bent.(11)\n\n_Goha_. Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way!\n\nWhy gaze upon the good man so,  \nWhen shame his living hope lays low?  \nThe cord was broken at the well,  \nAnd down the golden pitcher fell.24\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Mournfully_.]\n\nFrom thy dear lips, that vied with coral\'s red,  \n  Betraying teeth more bright than moonbeams fair,  \nMy soul with heaven\'s nectar once was fed.  \nHow can I, helpless, taste that poison dread,  \n  To drink shame\'s poisoned cup how can I bear?(13)\n\n_Ah \xc4\xabnta_. Proclaim the sentence again, man. [ _Goha does so_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_. So lowly fallen! till shame my virtues blur,\n\nTill such an ending seem not loss, but gain!  \nYet o\xc2\x92er my heart there creeps a saddening pain,  \nTo hear them cry abroad " _You_ murdered _her!_ "25\n\n[ _Enter Sth \xc4\x81varaka, fettered, in the palace tower_.]\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. [ _After listening to the proclamation. In distress_.] What!\nthe innocent Ch\xc4\x81rudatta is being put to death? And my master has thrown me\ninto chains! Well, I must shout to them. \xc2\x97Listen, good gentlemen, listen! It\nwas I, wretch that I am, who\n\np. 160\n\ncarried Vasantasen\xc4\x81 to the old garden Pushpakaranda, because she mistook my\nbullock-cart for another. And then my master, Sansth\xc4\x81naka, found that she\nwould not love him, and it was he, not this gentleman, who murdered her by\nstrangling.\xc2\x97But they are so far away that no one hears me. What shall I do?\nShall I cast myself down? [ _He reflects_.] If I do, then the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\nwill not be put to death. Yes, through this broken window I will throw myself\ndown from the palace tower. Better that I should meet my end, than that the\nnoble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta should perish, this tree of life for noble youths. And if I\ndie in such a cause, I have attained heaven. [ _He throws himself down_.]\nWonderful! I did not meet my end, and my fetters are broken. So I will follow\nthe sound of the headsmen\'s voices. [ _He discovers the headsmen, and hastens\nforward_.] Headsmen, headsmen, make way!\n\n_Headsmen_. For whom shall we make way?\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. Listen, good gentlemen, listen! It was I, wretch that I am, who\ncarried Vasantasen\xc4\x81 to the old garden Pushpakaranda, because she mistook my\nbullock-cart for another. And then my master, Sansth\xc4\x81naka, found that she\nwould not love him, and it was he, not this gentleman, who murdered her by\nstrangling.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Thank heaven!\n\nBut who thus gladdens this my latest morn,  \nWhen in Time\'s snare I struggle all forlorn,  \nA streaming cloud above the rainless corn?26\n\nListen! do you hear what I say?\n\nDeath have I never feared, but blackened fame;  \nMy death were welcome, coming free from shame,  \nAs were a son, new-born to bear my name.27\n\nAnd again:\n\nThat small, weak fool, whom I have never hated,  \nStained me with sin wherewith himself was mated,  \nAn arrow, with most deadly poison baited.28\n\n_Headsmen_. Are you telling the truth, Sth\xc4\x81varaka?\n\np. 161\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. I am. And to keep me from telling anybody, he cast me into\nchains, and imprisoned me in the tower of his palace.\n\n[ _Enter Sansth \xc4\x81naka_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Gleefully_.]\n\nI ate a shour and bitter dish  \nOf meat and herbs and shoup and fish;  \nI tried at home my tongue to tickle  \nWith rice-cakes plain, and rice with treacle.29\n\n[ _He listens_.] The headsmen\'s voices! They shound like a broken brass\ncymbal. I hear the music of the fatal drum and the kettledrums, and sho I\nshuppose that that poor man, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, is being led to the place of\nexecution. I musht go and shee it. It is a great delight to shee my enemy die.\nBeshides, I\'ve heard that a man who shees his enemy being killed, is sure not\nto have shore eyes in his next birth. I acted like a worm that had crept into\nthe knot of a lotush-root. I looked for a hole to crawl out at, and brought\nabout the death of thish poor man, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. Now I\'ll climb up the tower of\nmy own palace, and have a look at my own heroic deeds. [ _He does so and looks\nabout_.] Wonderful what a crowd there is, to shee that poor man led to his\ndeath! What would it be when an arishtocrat, a big man like me, was being led\nto his death? [ _He gazes_.] Look! There he goes toward the shouth, adorned\nlike a young shteer. But why was the proclamation made near my palace tower,\nand why was it shtopped? [ _He looks about_.] Why, my shlave Sth\xc4\x81varaka is\ngone, too. I hope he hasn\'t run away and betrayed the shecret. I musht go and\nlook for him. [ _He descends and approaches the crowd_.]\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. [ _Discovers him_.] There he comes, good masters!\n\n_Headsmen_. Give way! Make room! And shut the door!\n\nBe silent, and say nothing more!  \nHere comes a mad bull through the press,  \nWhose horns are sharp with wickedness.30\n\np. 162\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Come, come, make way! [ _He approaches_.] Sth\xc4\x81varaka, my\nlittle shon, my shlave, come, let\'s go home.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. You scoundrel! Are you not content with the murder of\nVasantasen\xc4\x81? Must you try now to murder the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, that tree of\nlife to all who loved him?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I am beautiful as a pot of jewels. I kill no woman!\n\n_Bystanders_. Oho! you murdered her, not the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Who shays that?\n\n_Bystanders_. [ _Pointing to Sth \xc4\x81varaka_.] This honest man.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Fearfully. Aside_.] Merciful heavens! Why didn\'t I chain\nthat shlave Sth\xc4\x81varaka fasht? Why, he was a witnessh of my crime. [ _He\nreflects_.] I\'ll do it thish way. [ _Aloud_.] Lies, lies, good gentlemen. Why,\nI caught the shlave shtealing gold, and I pounded him, and murdered him, and\nput him in chains. He hates me. What he shays can\'t be true. [ _He secretly\nhands Sth \xc4\x81varaka a bracelet, and whispers_.] Sth\xc4\x81varaka, my little shon, my\nshlave, take thish and shay shomething different.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. [ _Takes it_.] Look, gentlemen, look! Why, he is trying to\nbribe me with gold.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Snatches the bracelet from him_.] That\'s the gold that I\nput him in chains for. [ _Angrily_.] Look here, headsmen! I put him in charge\nof my gold-chest, and when he turned thief, I murdered him and pounded him. If\nyou don\'t believe it, jusht look at his back.\n\n_Headsmen_. [ _Doing so_.] Yes, yes. When a servant is branded that way, no\nwonder he tells tales.\n\n_Sth \xc4\x81varaka_. A curse on slavery! A slave convinces nobody. [ _Mournfully_.]\nNoble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, I have no further power. [ _He falls at Ch \xc4\x81rudatta\'s\nfeet_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Mournfully_.]\n\nRise, rise! Kind soul to good men fallen on pain!  \n  Brave friend who lendest such unselfish aid! p. 163  \nThy greatest toil to save me was in vain,  \n  For fate would not. Thy duty now is paid.31\n\n_Headsmen_. Beat your servant, master, and drive him away.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Out of the way, you! [ _He drives Sth \xc4\x81varaka away_.] Come,\nheadsmen, what are you waiting for? Kill him.\n\n_Headsmen_. Kill him yourself, if you are in a hurry.\n\n_Rohasena_. Oh, headsmen, kill me and let father go free.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Yesh, shon and father, kill them both.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. This fool might do anything. Go, my son, to your mother.\n\n_Rohasena_. And what should I do then?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_. Go with thy mother to a hermitage;\n\nNo moment, dear, delay;  \nLest of thy father\'s fault thou reap the wage,  \nAnd tread the selfsame way.32\n\nAnd you, my friend, go with him.\n\n_Maitreya_. Oh, my friend, have you so known me as to think that I can live\nwithout you?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Not so, my friend. Your life is your own. You may not throw it\naway.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aside_.] True. And yet I cannot live apart from my friend. And\nso, when I have taken the boy to his mother, I will follow my friend even in\ndeath. [ _Aloud_.] Yes, my friend, I will take him to her at once. [ _He\nembraces Ch \xc4\x81rudatta, then falls at his feet. Rohasena does the same,\nweeping_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Look here! Didn\'t I tell you to kill Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, and his shon,\ntoo? [ _At this, Ch \xc4\x81rudatta betrays fear_.]\n\n_Headsmen_. We haven\'t any orders from the king to kill Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, and his\nson, too. Run away, boy, run away! [ _They drive Rohasena away_.] Here is the\nthird place of proclamation. Beat the drum! [ _They proclaim the sentence\nagain_.]\n\np. 164\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Aside_.] But the citizens don\'t believe it. [ _Aloud_.]\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta, you jackanapes, the citizens don\'t believe it. Shay it with your\nown tongue, "I murdered Vasantasen\xc4\x81." [ _Ch \xc4\x81rudatta remains silent_.] Look\nhere, headsmen! The man won\'t shpeak, the jackanapes Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. Jusht make\nhim shpeak. Beat him a few times with thish ragged bamboo, or with a chain.\n\n_Goha_. [ _Raises his arm to strike_.] Come, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, speak!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Mournfully_.]\n\nNow am I sunk so deep in sorrow\'s sea,  \nI know no fear, I know no sadness more;  \nYet even now one flame still tortures me,  \nThat men should say I slew whom I adore.33\n\n[ _Sansth \xc4\x81naka repeats his words_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Men of my own city!\n\nA scoundrel I, who bear the blame,  \nNor seek in heaven to be blest;  \nA maid\xc2\x97or goddess\xc2\x97\xc2\x92tis the same  \nBut he will say the rest.(ix. 30)\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Killed her!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. So be it.\n\n_Goha_. It\'s your turn to kill him, man.\n\n_Ah \xc4\xabnta_. No, yours.\n\n_Goha_. Well, let\'s reckon it out. [ _He does so at great length_.] Well, if\nit\'s my turn to kill him, we will just let it wait a minute.\n\n_Ah \xc4\xabnta_. Why?\n\n_Goha_. Well, when my father was going to heaven, he said to me, "Son Goha, if\nit\'s your turn to kill him, don\'t kill the sinner too quick."\n\n_Ah \xc4\xabnta_. But why?\n\n_Goha_. "Perhaps," said he, "some good man might give the money to set him\nfree. Perhaps a son might be born to the king, and to celebrate the event, all\nthe prisoners might be set free. Perhaps\n\np. 165\n\nan elephant might break loose, and the prisoner might escape in the\nexcitement. Perhaps there might be a change of kings, and all the prisoners\nmight be set free."\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. What? What? A change of kings?\n\n_Goha_. Well, let\'s reckon it out, whose turn it is. Sansth\xc4\x81naka. Oh, come!\nKill Ch\xc4\x81rudatta at once. [ _He takes Sth \xc4\x81varaka, and withdraws a little_.]\n\n_Headsmen_. Noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, it is the king\'s commandment that bears the\nblame, not we headsmen. Think then of what you needs must think.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.\n\n  Though slandered by a cruel fate,  \n  And stained by men of high estate,  \nIf that my virtue yet regarded be,  \n  Then she who dwells with gods above  \n  Or wheresoever else\xc2\x97my love\xc2\x97  \nBy her sweet nature wipe the stain from me!34\n\nTell me. Whither would you have me go?\n\n_Goha_. [ _Pointing ahead_.] Why, here is the southern burying-ground, and\nwhen a criminal sees that, he says good-by to life in a minute. For look!\n\nOne half the corpse gaunt jackals rend and shake,  \n   And ply their horrid task;  \nOne half still hangs impaled upon the stake,  \n   Loud laughter\'s grinning mask.35\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Alas! Ah, woe is me! [ _In his agitation he sits down_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I won\'t go yet. I\'ll jusht shee Ch\xc4\x81rudatta killed. [ _He walks\nabout, gazing_.] Well, well! He shat down.\n\n_Goha_. Are you frightened, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Rising hastily_.] Fool!\n\nDeath have I never feared, but blackened fame;  \nMy death were welcome, coming free from shame,  \nAs were a son, new-born to bear my name.(27)\n\np. 166\n\n_Goha_. Noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, the moon and the sun dwell in the vault of heaven,\nyet even they are overtaken by disaster. How much more, death-fearing\ncreatures, and men! In this world, one rises only to fall, another falls only\nto rise again. But from him who has risen and falls, his body drops like a\ngarment. Lay these thoughts to heart, and be strong. [ _To Ah \xc4\xabnta_.] Here is\nthe fourth place of proclamation. Let us proclaim the sentence. [ _They do so\nonce again_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Vasantasen\xc4\x81! Oh, my beloved!\n\nFrom thy dear lips, that vied with coral\'s red,  \nBetraying teeth more bright than moonbeams fair,  \nMy soul with heaven\'s nectar once was fed.  \nHow can I, helpless, taste that poison dread,  \nTo drink shame\'s poisoned cup how can I bear?(13)\n\n[ _Enter, in great agitation, Vasantasen \xc4\x81 and the Buddhist monk_.]\n\n_Monk_. Strange! My monkish life did me yeoman service when it proved\nnecessary to comfort Vasantasen\xc4\x81, so untimely wearied, and to lead her on her\nway. Sister in Buddha, whither shall I lead you? Vasantasen\xc4\x81. To the noble\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta\'s house. Revive me with the sight of him, as the night-blooming\nwater-lily is revived by the sight of the moon.\n\n_Monk_. [ _Aside_.] By which road shall I enter? [ _He reflects_.] The king\'s\nhighway\xc2\x97I\'ll enter by that. Come, sister in Buddha! Here is the king\'s\nhighway. [ _Listening_.] But what is this great tumult that I hear on the\nking\'s highway?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Looking before her_.] Why, there is a great crowd of people\nbefore us. Pray find out, sir, what it means. All Ujjayin\xc4\xab tips to one side,\nas if the earth bore an uneven load.\n\n\n\n_Goha_. And here is the last place of proclamation. Beat the drum! Proclaim\nthe sentence! [ _They do so_.] Now, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, wait! Don\'t be frightened. You\nwill be killed very quickly.\n\np. 167\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Ye blessed gods!\n\n_Monk_. [ _Listens. In terror_.] Sister in Buddha, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta is being led to\nhis death for murdering you.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _In terror_.] Alas! For my wretched sake the noble\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta put to death? Quick, quick! Oh, lead me thither!\n\n_Monk_. Hasten, oh, hasten, sister in Buddha, to comfort the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\nwhile he yet lives. Make way, gentlemen, make way!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Make way, make way!\n\n_Goha_. Noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, it is the king\'s commandment that bears the blame.\nThink then of what you needs must think.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Why waste words?\n\n  Though slandered by a cruel fate,  \n  And stained by men of high estate,  \nIf that my virtue yet regarded be,  \n  Then she who dwells with gods above  \n  Or wheresoever else\xc2\x97my love\xc2\x97  \nBy her sweet nature wipe the stain from me!(34)\n\n_Goha_. [ _Drawing his sword_.] Noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, lie flat and be quiet. With\none stroke we will kill you and send you to heaven. [ _Ch \xc4\x81rudatta does so.\nGoha raises his arm to strike. The sword falls from his hand_.] What is this?\n\nI fiercely grasped within my hand  \nMy thunderbolt-appalling brand;  \nWhy did it fall upon the sand? 36\n\nBut since it did, I conclude that the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta is not to die. Have\nmercy, O mighty goddess of the Sahya hills! If only Ch\xc4\x81rudatta might be saved,\nthen hadst thou shown favor to our headsman caste.\n\n_Ah \xc4\xabnta_. Let us do as we were ordered.\n\n_Goha_. Well, let us do it. [ _They make ready to impale Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.]\n\np. 168\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_.\n\n  Though slandered by a cruel fate,  \n  And stained by men of high estate,  \nIf that my virtue yet regarded be,  \n  Then she who dwells with gods above  \n  Or wheresoever else\xc2\x97my love  \nBy her sweet nature wipe the stain from me!(34)\n\n_Monk and Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Perceiving what is being done_.] Good gentlemen!\nHold, hold!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Good gentlemen! I am the wretch for whose sake he is put to\ndeath.\n\n_Goha_. [ _Perceiving her_.]\n\nWho is the woman with the streaming hair  \nThat smites her shoulder, loosened from its bands?  \nShe loudly calls upon us to forbear,  \nAnd hastens hither with uplifted hands.37\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Oh, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta! What does it mean? [ _She falls on his\nbreast_.]\n\n_Monk_. Oh, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta! What does it mean? [ _He falls at his feet_.]\n\n_Goha_. [ _Anxiously withdrawing_.] Vasantasen\xc4\x81?\xc2\x97At least, we did not kill an\ninnocent man.\n\n_Monk_. [ _Rising_.] Thank heaven! Ch\xc4\x81rudatta lives.\n\n_Goha_. And shall live a hundred years!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Joyfully_.] And I too am brought back to life again.\n\n_Goha_. The king is at the place of sacrifice. Let us report to him what has\ntaken place. [ _The two headsmen start to go away_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Perceives Vasantasen \xc4\x81. In terror_.] Goodnessh! who brought\nthe shlave back to life? Thish is the end of me. Good! I\'ll run away. [ _He\nruns away_.]\n\n_Goha_. [ _Returning_.] Well, didn\'t we have orders from the king to put the\nman to death who murdered Vasantasen\xc4\x81? Let us hunt for the king\'s brother-in-\nlaw.\n\n[ _Exeunt the two headsmen_.\n\np. 169\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _In amazement_.]\n\nWho saves me from the uplifted weapon\'s scorn,  \nWhen in Death\'s jaws I struggled all forlorn,  \nA streaming cloud above the rainless corn?38\n\n[ _He gazes at her_.]\n\nIs this Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s counterfeit?  \nOr she herself, from heaven above descended?  \nOr do I but in madness see my sweet?  \nOr has her precious life not yet been ended?39\n\nOr again:\n\nDid she return from heaven,  \nThat I might rescued be?  \nWas her form to another given?  \nIs this that other she?40\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Rises tearfully and falls at his feet_.] O noble\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta, I am indeed the wretch for whose sake you are fallen upon this\nunworthy plight.\n\n_Voices behind the scenes_. A miracle, a miracle! Vasantasen\xc4\x81 lives. [ _The\nbystanders repeat the words_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Listens, then rises suddenly, embraces Vasantasen \xc4\x81, and\ncloses his eyes. In a voice trembling with emotion_.] My love! You are\nVasantasen\xc4\x81!\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. That same unhappy woman.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Gazes upon her. Joyfully_.] Can it be? Vasantasen\xc4\x81 herself?\n[ _In utter happiness_.]\n\nHer bosom bathed in streaming tears,  \n  When in Death\'s power I fell,  \nWhence is she come to slay my fears,  \n  Like heavenly magic\'s spell?41\n\nVasantasen\xc4\x81! Oh, my beloved!\n\nUnto my body, whence the life was fleeting,  \n  And all for thee, thou knewest life to give.  \nOh, magic wonderful in lovers\xc2\x92 meeting!  \n  What power besides could make the dead man live?42\n\np. 170\n\nBut see, my beloved!\n\nMy blood-red garment seems a bridegroom\'s cloak,  \nDeath\'s garland seems to me a bridal wreath;  \n          My love is near.  \nAnd marriage music seems the fatal stroke  \nOf drums that heralded my instant death;  \n          For she is here.43\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. You with your utter kindliness, what can it be that you have\ndone?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. My beloved, he said that I had killed you.\n\nFor ancient hatred\'s sake, my mighty foe,  \nHell\'s victim now, had almost laid me low.44\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. [ _Stopping her ears_.] Heaven avert the omen! It was he, the\nking\'s brother-in-law, who killed me.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Perceiving the monk_.] But who is this?\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. When that unworthy wretch had killed me, this worthy man\nbrought me back to life.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Who are you, unselfish friend?\n\n_Monk_. You do not remember me, sir. I am that shampooer, who once was happy\nto rub your feet. When I fell into the hands of certain gamblers, this sister\nin Buddha, upon hearing that I had been your servant, bought my freedom with\nher jewels. Thereupon I grew tired of the gambler\'s life, and became a\nBuddhist monk. Now this lady made a mistake in her bullock-cart, and so came\nto the old garden Pushpakaranda. But when that unworthy wretch learned that\nshe would not love him, he murdered her by strangling. And I found her there.\n\n_Loud voices behind the scenes_.\n\nUnending victory to Shiva be,  \n  Who Daksha\'s offering foiled;  \nAnd victory may K\xc4\x81rttikeya see,  \n  Who Krauncha smote and spoiled; p. 171  \nAnd victory to Aryaka the king  \n  His mighty foe he kills  \nFar over all the earth\'s expansive ring,  \nThat earth her joyous flag abroad may fling,  \n  The snowy banner of Kail\xc4\x81sa\'s hills.45\n\n[ _Enter hurriedly Sharvilaka_.]\n\n_Sharv_.\n\nYes, P\xc4\x81laka, the royal wretch, I slew,  \nAnointing Aryaka good king and true;  \n  And now, like sacrificial flowers, I wed  \n  The king\'s commandment to my bended head,  \nTo give sad Ch\xc4\x81rudatta life anew.46\n\nThe foe whose powers and friends had fled, he slew,  \nConsoled and comforted his subjects true;  \n  And earth\'s broad sovereignty has gladly wed  \n  His power, and bent to him her lowly head,  \nWho toward his foe plays Indra\'s part anew.47\n\n[ _He looks before him_.] Ah! There he will be found, where the people are\nthus gathered together. Oh, that this deed of King Aryaka might be crowned\nwith the rescued life of noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta! [He quickens his steps.] Make way,\nyou rascals! [ _He discovers Ch \xc4\x81rudatta. Joyfully_.] Is Ch\xc4\x81rudatta yet\nliving, and Vasantasen\xc4\x81? Truly, our sovereign\'s wishes are fulfilled.\n\nNow, thanks to heaven, from sorrow\'s shoreless sea  \nI see him saved by her he loved, set free  \nBy that sweet bark, that knew her course to steer  \nWith virtue\'s tackle and with goodness\' gear.  \nHe seems the moon, whose light shines clear at last,  \nWhen all the sad eclipse is overpast.48\n\nYet how shall I approach him, who have so grievously sinned against him? But\nno! Honesty is always honorable. [ _He approaches and, folds his hands.\nAloud_.] O noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Who are you, sir?\n\np. 172\n\n_Sharvilaka_.\n\nI forced your house in manner base,  \n  And stole the gems there left behind;  \n  But though this sin oppress my mind,  \nI throw myself upon your grace.49\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Not so, my friend. Thereby you showed your faith in me. [ _He\nembraces him_.]\n\n_Sharvilaka_. And one thing more:\n\nThe very noble Aryaka,  \n  To save his family and name,  \nHas slain the wretched P\xc4\x81laka,  \n  A victim at the altar\'s flame.50\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. What say you?\n\n_Sharvilaka_.\n\n\xc2\x92Twas your cart helped him on his way,  \n  Who sought the shelter of your name;  \nHe slew King P\xc4\x81laka to-day,  \n  A victim at the altar\'s flame.51\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Sharvilaka, did you set free that Aryaka, whom P\xc4\x81laka took from\nhis hamlet, and confined without cause in the tower?\n\n_Sharvilaka_. I did.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. This is indeed most welcome tidings.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Scarcely was your friend Aryaka established in Ujjayin\xc4\xab, when he\nbestowed upon you the throne of Kush\xc4\x81vat\xc4\xab, on the bank of the Ven\xc4\x81. May you\ngraciously receive this first token of his love. [ _He turns around_.] Come,\nlead hither that rascal, that villain, the brother-in-law of the king!\n\n_Voices behind the scenes_. We will, Sharvilaka.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Sir, King Aryaka declares that he won this kingdom through your\nvirtues, and that you are therefore to have some benefit from it.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. The kingdom won through my virtues?\n\n\n\n_Voices behind the scenes_. Come on, brother-in-law of the king, and\n\np. 173\n\nreap the reward of your insolence. [ _Enter Sansth \xc4\x81naka, guarded, with his\nhands tied behind his back_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Goodnessh gracious!\n\nIt came to pass, I ran away  \nLike any ass, and had my day.  \nThey drag me round, a prishoner,  \nAs if they\'d found a naughty cur.52\n\n[ _He looks about him_.] They crowd around me, though I\'m a relative of the\nking\'s. To whom shall I go for help in my helplesshnessh? [ _He reflects_.]\nGood! I\'ll go to the man who gives help and shows mercy to the shuppliant. [\n_He approaches_.] Noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, protect me, protect me! [ _He falls at his\nfeet_.]\n\n_Voices behind the scenes_. Noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, leave him to us! let us kill\nhim!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [To Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.] O helper of the helplessh, protect me!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Mercifully_.] Yes, yes. He who seeks protection shall be\nsafe.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. [ _Impatiently_.] Confound him! Take him away from Ch\xc4\x81rudatta! [\n_To Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.] Tell me. What shall be done with the wretch?\n\nShall he be bound and dragged until he dies?  \nShall dogs devour the scoundrel as he lies?  \nIf he should be impaled, \xc2\x92twould be no blunder,  \nNor if we had the rascal sawn asunder.53\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Will you do as I say?\n\n_Sharvilaka_. How can you doubt it?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta! Mashter! I sheek your protection. Protect me,\nprotect me! Do shomething worthy of yourshelf. I\'ll never do it again!\n\n_Voices of citizens behind the scenes_. Kill him! Why should the wretch be\nallowed to live?\n\np. 174\n\n[ _Vasantasen \xc4\x81 takes the garland of death from Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s neck, and throws\nit upon Sansth\xc4\x81naka_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. You shlave-wench, be merciful, be merciful! I\'ll never murder\nyou again. Protect me!\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Come, take him away! Noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, say what shall be done\nwith the wretch.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Will you do as I say?\n\n_Sharvilaka_. How can you doubt it?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Really?\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Really.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Then let him be immediately\xc2\x97\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Killed?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. No, no! Set free.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. What for?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_.\n\nThe humbled foe who seeks thine aid,  \nThou mayst not smite with steely blade\xc2\x97\n\n_Sharvilaka_. All right. We will have the dogs eat him alive.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.\n\nNo, no!  \nBe cruelty with kindness paid.54\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Wonderful! What shall I do? Tell me, sir.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Why, set him free.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. It shall be done.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Hooray! I breathe again.\n\n[ _Exit, with the guards_.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Mistress Vasantasen\xc4\x81, the king is pleased to bestow upon you the\ntitle "wedded wife."\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Sir, I desire no more.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. [ _Places the veil_  1 _upon Vasantasen \xc4\x81. To Ch\xc4\x81rudatta_.] Sir,\nwhat shall be done for this monk?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Monk, what do you most desire?\n\n_Monk_. When I see this example of the uncertainty of all things,\n\np. 175\n\nI am twice content to be a monk.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. His purpose is not to be changed, my friend. Let him be\nappointed spiritual father over all the monasteries in the land.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. It shall be done.\n\n_Monk_. It is all that I desire.\n\n_Vasantasen \xc4\x81_. Now I am indeed brought back to life.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. What shall be done for Sth\xc4\x81varaka?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Let the good fellow be given his freedom. Let those headsmen be\nappointed chiefs of all the headsmen. Let Chandanaka be appointed chief of all\nthe police in the land. Let the brother-in-law of the king continue to act\nexactly as he acted in the past.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. It shall be done. Only that man\xc2\x97leave him to me, and I\'ll kill\nhim.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.\n\nHe who seeks protection shall be safe.  \nThe humbled foe who seeks thine aid,  \nThou mayst not smite with steely blade.  \nBe cruelty with kindness paid.(54)\n\n_Sharvilaka_. Then tell me what I may yet do for you.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Can there be more than this?\n\nI kept unstained my virtue\'s even worth,  \n  Granted my enemy his abject suit;  \n  Friend Aryaka destroyed his foeman\'s root,  \nAnd rules a king o\xc2\x92er all the steadfast earth.\n\nThis dear-loved maiden is at last mine own,  \n  And you united with me as a friend.  \nAnd shall I ask for further mercies, shown  \n  To me, who cannot sound these mercies\xc2\x92 end?58\n\nFate plays with us like buckets at the well,  \nWhere one is filled, and one an empty shell,  \n  Where one is rising, while another falls;  \nAnd shows how life is change\xc2\x97now heaven, now hell.59\n\nYet may the wishes of our epilogue be fulfilled.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[154:1](lcc16.htm#fr_84) That is, the lightning.\n\n[157:1](lcc16.htm#fr_85) Rohasena is himself conceived as the receptacle of\nthe water which a son must pour as a drink-offering to his dead father.\n\n[157:2](lcc16.htm#fr_86) The Manes or spirits of the blessed dead.\n\n[174:1](lcc16.htm#fr_87) A token of honorable marriage.
