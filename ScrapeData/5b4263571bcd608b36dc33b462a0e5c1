The wicked maid  \nThe mandate of her queen obeyed,  \nAnd darkly plotting Rama's fall  \nResponded to Kaikeyi's call.  \n\n'I will declare, do thou attend,  \nHow Bharat may his throne ascend.  \nDost thou forget what things befell?  \nOr dost thou feign, remembering well?  \nOr wouldst thou hear my tongue repeat  \nA story for thy need so meet?  \nGay lady, if thy will be so,  \nNow hear the tale of long ago,  \nAnd when my tongue has done its part  \nPonder the story in thine heart.  \nWhen Gods and demons fought of old,  \nThy lord, with royal saints enrolled,  \nSued to the war with thee to bring  \nHis might to aid the Immortals' King.  \nFar to the southern land he sped  \nWhere Dandak's mighty wilds are spread,  \nTo Vaijayanta's city swayed  \nBy S'ambara, whose flag displayd  \nThe hugest monster of the sea.  \nLord of a hundred wiles was be;  \nWith might which Gods could never blame  \nAgainst the King of Heaven he came.  \nThen raged the battle wild and dread,  \nAnd mortal warriors fought and bled;  \nThe fiends by night with strength renewed  \nCharged, slew the sleeping multitude.  \nThy lord, King Das'aratha, long  \nStood fighting with the demon throng,  \nBut long of arm, unmatched in strength,  \nFell wounded by their darts at length.  \nThy husband, senseless, by thine aid  \nWas from the battle field conveyed.  \nAnd wounded nigh to death thy lord  \nWas by thy care to health restored.  \nWell pleased the grateful monarch sware  \nTo grant thy first and second prayer.  \nThou for no favour then wouldst sue,  \nThe gifts reserved for season due;  \nAnd he, thy high-souled lord, agreed  \nTo give the boons when thou shouldst need.  \nMyself I knew not what befell,  \nBut oft the tale have heard thee tell,  \nAnd close to thee in friendship knit  \nDeep in my heart have treasured it.  \nRemind thy husband of his oath,  \nRecall the boons and claim them both,  \nThat Bharat on the throne be placed  \nWith rites of consecration graced,  \nAnd Rama to the woods be sent  \nFor twice seven years of banishment.  \nGo, Queen, the mourner's chamber  1 seek,  \nWith angry eye and burning cheek;  \nAnd with disordered robes and hair  \nOn the cold earth lie prostrate there.  \nWhen the king comes still mournful lie,  \nSpeak not a word nor meet his eye,  \nBut let thy tears in torrent flow,  \nAnd lie enamoured of thy woe.  \nWell do I know thou long hast been,  \nAnd ever art, his darling queen.  \nFor thy dear sake, O well-loved dame,  \nThe mighty king would brave the flame,  \nBut ne'er would anger thee, or brook  \nTo meet his favourite's wrathful look.  \nThy loving lord would even die  \nThy fancy, Queen, to gratify,  \nAnd never could he arm his breast  \nTo answer nay to thy request.  \nListen and learn, O dull of sense,  \nThine all-resistless influence.  \nGems he will offer, pearls and gold:  \nRefuse his gifts, be stern and cold.  \nThose proffered boons at length recall,  \nAnd claim them till he grants thee all.  \nAnd O my lady, high in bliss,  \nWith heedful thought forget not this.  \nWhen from the ground his queen he lifts  \nAnd grants again the promised gifts,  \nBind him with oaths he cannot break  \nAnd thy demands unflnching, make.  \nThat Rama travel to the wild  \nFive years and nine from home exiled,  \nAnd Bharat, best of all who reign.  \nThe empire of the land obtain.  \nFor when this term of years has fled  \nOver the banished Rama's head,  \nThy royal son to vigour grown  \nAnd rooted firm will stand alone.  \nThe king, I know, is well inclined,  \nAnd this the hour to move his mind.  \nBe bold: the threatened rite prevent,  \nAnd force the king from his intent.'  \n\nShe ceased. So counselled to her bane  \nDisguised beneath a show of gain,  \nKaikeyi in her joy and pride  \nTo Manthara again replied:  \n'Thy sense I envy, prudent maid;  \nWith sagest lore thy lids persuade.  \nNo hump-back maid in all the earth,  \nFor wise resolve, can match thy worth.  \nThou art alone with constant zeal  \nDevoted to thy lady's weal.  \nDear girl, without thy faithful aid  \nI had not marked the plot he laid.  \n\np. 100  \n\nFull of all guile and sin and spite  \nMisshapen hump-backs shock the sight:  \nBut thou art fair and formed to please,  \nBent like a lily by the breeze.  \nI look thee o'er with watchful eye,  \nAnd in thy frame no fault can spy;  \nThe chest so deep, the waist so trim,  \nSo round the lines of breast and limb. 1  \nThy cheeks with moonlike beauty shine,  \nAnd the warm wealth of youth is thine.  \nThy legs, my girl, are long and neat,  \nAnd somewhat long thy dainty feet,  \nWhile stepping out before my face  \nThou seemest like a crane to pace.  \nThe thousand wiles are in thy breast  \nWhich Sambara the fiend possessed,  \nAnd countless others all thine own,  \nO damsel sage, to thee are known.  \nThy very hump becomes thee too,  \nO thou whose face is fair to view,  \nFor there reside in endless store  \nPlots, wissard wiles, and warrior lore.  \nA golden chain I'll round it fling  \nWhen Rama's flight makes Bharat king:  \nYea, polished links of finest gold,  \nWhen once the wished for prize I hold  \nWith naught to fear and none to hate,  \nThy hump, dear maid, shall decorate.  \nA golden frontlet wrought with care,  \nAnd precious jewels shalt thou wear:  \nTwo lovely robes around thee fold,  \nAnd walk a Goddess to behold,  \nBidding the moon himself compare  \nHis beauty with a face so fair.  \nWith scent of precious sandal sweet  \nDown to the nails upon thy feet,  \nFirst of the household thou shalt go  \nAnd pay with scorn each battled foe.'  \n   Kaikeyi's praise the damnel heard,  \nAnd thus again her lady stirred,  \nWho lay upon her beauteous bed  \nLike fire upon the altar fed:  \n'Dear Queen, they build the bridge in vain  \nWhen swollen streams are dry again.  \nArise, thy glorious task complete,  \nAnd draw the king to thy retreat.'  \n   The large-eyed lady left her bower  \nExulting in her pride of power,  \nAnd with the hump-back sought the gloom  \nAnd silence of the mourner's room.  \nThe string of priceless pearls that huug  \nAround her neck to earth she flung,  \nWith all the wealth and lustre lent  \nBy precious gem and ornament.  \nThen, listening to her slave's advice,  \nLay, like a nymph from Paradise.  \n\nAs on the ground her limbs she laid  \nOnce more she cried unto the maid:  \n'Soon must thou to the monarch say  \nKaikeyi's soul has past away,  \nOr, Rama banished as we planned,  \nMy son made king shall rule the land.  \nNo more for gold and gems I care,  \nFor brave attire or dainty fare.  \nIf Rama should the throne ascend,  \nThat very hour my life will end.'  \n\n   The royal lady wounded through  \nThe bosom with the darts that flew  \n   Launched from the hump-back's tongue  \nPressed both her hands upon her side,  \nAnd o'er and o'er again she cried  \n   With wildering fury stung:  \n'Yes, it shall be thy task to tell  \nThat I have hurried hence to dwell  \n   In Yama's realms of woe,  \nOr happy Bharat shall be king,  \nAnd doomed to years of wandering  \n   Kaus'alya's son shall go.  \nI heed not dainty viands now  \nFair wreaths of flowers to twine my brow,  \n   Soft balm or precious scent:  \nMy very life I count as naught,  \nNothing on earth can claim my thought  \n   But Rama's banishment.'  \n   She spoke these words of cruel ire;  \nThen stripping off her gay attire,  \n   The cold bare floor she pressed.  \nSo, falling from her home on high,  \nSome lovely daughter of the sky  \n   Upon the ground might rest.  \nWith darkened brow and furious mien,  \nStripped of her gems and wreath, the queen  \n   In spotless beauty lay,  \nLike heaven obscured with gathering cloud,  \nWhen shades of midnight darkness shroud  \n   Each star's expiring ray.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[99:1](ry087.htm#fr_270) Literally _the chamber of wrath, a 'growlery,'_ a\nsmall, dark, unfurnished room to which it seems, the wives and ladies of the\nking betook themselves when offended and sulky.\n\n[100:1](ry087.htm#fr_271) In these four lines I do not translate faithfully,\nand I do not venture to follow Kaikeyi farther in her eulogy of the hump-\nback's charms.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto X.: Das'aratha's Speech.](ry088.htm)\n\n"
