Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Best of the Brahmi _n_ s! What are men to do in the\ntime of Navaratra? Especially in the Navaratra ceremony during the autumnal\nseason how is the ceremony to be performed? Kindly relate all this with the\nprescribed rules and regulations.\n\n\n\n2\\. O intelligent one! What are the fruits therein of the Navaratra ceremony?\nand what are the rules to be observed? Kindly describe all these to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n3-5. Vyasa said :-- O king! Hear about the vow of auspicious Navaratra. This\nhas to be performed with loving devotion in the vernal season; but its special\nseason is autumn. The two seasons, autumn and spring, are famous as the teeth\nof Yama, the God of Death; and these are the two seasons, very hard for the\npersons to cross over. Therefore every goodfaring man should everywhere\nperform this vow very carefully.\n\n\n\n6-8. O king! The people are very much afflicted with various terrible diseases\nin these two seasons autumn and spring and many lose their lives during these\nportions of the year. Therefore the wise should unquestionably worship with\ngreat devotion the Chandika Devi in these auspicious months of Chaitra and\n\xc3\x82s\xc2\x92vin.\n\n\n\n9-11. On the day previous to the commencement of the vow, when the Amavasya\ntithi commences, one should collect the materials that will be required in the\nworship and should eat only once in that tithi what is called Habi _s_ yanna\n(sacred food, boiled rice with ghee) and should on that day prepare an open\nshade in a temporary building, twenty four (24) feet in dimensions, on a level\npiece of ground, that is considered holy; it is to be equipped with a post and\na flag. Next, this is to be heaped over with yellow earth and cow dung. Then a\nraised platform called the Vedi, six feet wide and one and a half foot high,\nlevel and hard, is to be erected, and provided with an excellent space thereon\nfor the seat of the Devi. Provisions are to be made also for ornamented gate\nways and an awning over the top.\n\n\n\n12-17. One should invite then, those Brahmi _n_ s, that observe fully the\ncustoms and usages, who are self restrained and versed in the Vedas and\nVedangas, especially those who are skilled in the ceremony of worshipping the\nDevi.\n\n\n\np. 226\n\n\n\nNext, in the Pratipad tithi (the first day of the bright half), one should\ntake one\xc2\x92s morning ablutions in a river, or in a lake, tank or a well or in\none\xc2\x92s own residence, according to rules, and one should perform one\xc2\x92s every\nday practices of Sandhya Bandanam. Afterwards he should appoint the Brahmi _n_\ns and give them water for washing their feet and Arghya (offerings of grass,\nrice, etc.,) and Madhuparka (an oblation of honey and milk, etc.) and give\nthen, as his means permit, clothings and ornaments to them. If he happens to\nbe rich, he should never show his miserliness here in making these gifts; for\nif the Brahmi _n_ s be satisfied, they will try their best to make the\nceremony a complete success. O king! The Chan _d_ i paths (the reading of the\nbook called Chan _d_ i) and Bhagavata paths (the reading of some portions of\nthe book named Bhagavat) are done on this occasion, for the satisfaction of\nthe Goddess; and either nine Brahmi _n_ s or five or three or at least one\nBrahmi _n_ should be appointed for the purpose. Moreover one other Brahmi _n_\n, of a restrained and calm nature, is to be appointed, who would observe the\nfasting on the day previous (paraya _n_ a). All these being done, the able man\nis to perform the ceremony preparatory to the solemn Devi worship, (in which\nthe priest utters the Vedic mantra Svasti-vachana, Svasti na Indro\nvriddhas\xc2\x92ravah, etc.). Om Hrim S\xc2\x92rim Dum Durgayai namah is the nine lettered\nDurga mantra.\n\n\n\n18-20. O king! When the ceremony has been thus commenced, one should place on\nthe Vedi (a raised platform; an altar), the throne fitted with double silken\nclothes; and, on that throne, he should place the image of the Devi. The Devi,\nthe Eternal World-Mother, is to be four-armed or eighteen armed, (4 or 18)\nfully provided with all the weapons, ornamented with garlands of pearls and\njewels, decorated with various ornaments of gems and precious stones, wearing\nexcellent heavenly clothings, all the parts of the image being artistically\nfinished and endowed with all the auspicious signs, mounted on a lion, and\nholding conch shell, wheel, club, and lotus in Her hands.\n\n\n\nNote :-- The Devi, here, is represented with four (4) or eighteen (18) hands.\n\n\n\n21-22. In the absence of the image, one should place an earthen water-pot, on\nthat throne, thoroughly purified by the Vedic Mantras, filled with gold and\njewels, and filled fully with the water, brought from a sacred river or a\nsacred place of pilgrimage and with five young shoots of plants, the\nextremities of branches bearing new leaves immersed in water. Beside the\nwater-pot on the throne, there should be a symbol (Diagram or Yantra) with the\nnine lettered Mantram (Om Hrim S\xc2\x92rim Cha _nd_ ikayai namah) in it for the\npurpose of worship.\n\n\n\np. 227\n\n\n\n23\\. One should place on one\xc2\x92s side all the materials of worship in their due\nplaces, and then have the music and other sounding drums played, for the good\nfortune and prosperity of the family.\n\n\n\nNote :-- Look for the mantras in the book Mantramaho Dadhi.\n\n\n\n24\\. O king! If the first day be the Nanda tithi (i.e., the first day of the\nbright half with the asterism Hasta in the ascendant), then that is the best\ntime for worshipping duly the Holy Goddess. There is no doubt that special\nfortunate results would arise on this.\n\n\n\n25\\. On the previous night, one should observe fasting, or on the previous day\none should take only one meal of Habi _s_ yanna (boiled rice and ghee) and on\nthe next day one should make a Sankalpa (an avowal of the purpose to perform a\nrite) and then begin worship.\n\n\n\n26\\. One should pray before the Goddess thus, \xc2\x93O Mother, Mother of the World!\nI will perform this excellent Navaratra vow; be pleased to help me in every\nrespect.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n27\\. One is to observe, as far as possible, all the rules enjoined in this vow\nand then utter the mantras and do the worship according to the prescribe\nrules.\n\n\n\n28-31. First of all, one should worship duly the Goddess Jagaddhatri,\npresenting Her Chandan (sandal paste), Aguru (a fragrant wood, the aloe wood),\nCamphor, the flowers Mandara (one of the five trees of the celestial regions),\nKaraja a kind of fragrant flower)! As\xc2\x92oka, Champaka, Karavir, Malati, and\nBrahmi and various lovely sweet scented flowers and good Bel leaves, Dhupa\n(incense, a fragrant gum burnt before idols) and lamps. Next one should\npresent the fruits cocoanut, Matulinga, the pomegranate, bananas, oranges, the\njack fruits, Bel and various other delicious fruit and then, offering Her\narghya, present boiled rice and other food with a heart, full of devotion.\n\n\n\n32\\. Those who eat meat, they can sacrifice animals in this worship of the\nDevi; and, for this purpose, goat and wild boars are the best.\n\n\n\n33-34. O sinless one! The goats, etc., offered as a sacrifice before the Devi\nattain to unending heavens. Therefore persons offering the sacrifices of goats\ndo not incur any sin. O king! The goats, etc., and other beast offered as a\nsacrifice before the Devas undoubtedly go to the heavenly regions; therefore,\nin all the S\xc2\x92astras, it has been decided that this killing of animals in a\nsacrifice is considered as non-killing.\n\n\n\n35\\. Now, for doing the Homa ceremony one should prepare, according to one\xc2\x92s\nrequirements, a triangular pit from one to ten hands in dimension and a\ntriangular level piece of ground covered with sand.\n\n\n\n36\\. Daily, thrice, one should worship the Devi with various lovely\n\n\n\np. 228\n\n\n\narticles and finally make a great festivity with dancing, singing and music.\n\n\n\n37\\. Everyday he should sleep on the ground and worship the virgins (young\ngirl from the age of two to the age of ten) with nectar like sweetmeats and\nbeautiful clothings aud ornaments.\n\n\n\n38\\. Everyday one virgin or increased by one, two, or three every day or nine\nvirgins in all the days respectively are to be worshipped.\n\n\n\n39\\. O king! One should perform worshipping this Kumari (virgin) Puja for the\nsatisfaction of the Devi, as his means allow; never one is to shew miserliness\nin this.\n\n\n\n40\\. O king! Hear the rules of the virgin worship that I am going to tell you.\nThe virgin, aged one year, is not to be worshipped; for they are quite\nignorant as to smell and tasting various delicious things.\n\n\n\n41-43. The virgin aged two years is named the Kumari; aged three years is\nnamed the Trimurti four years, is called the Kalyani; five years, Rohi _n_ i;\nsix years, Kalika; seventh year, Chandika; eighth year, S\xc2\x92ambhavi; ninth year,\nDurga; and a virgin, aged ten years, is called Subhadra. Virgins aged more\nthan ten years are not allowed in all ceremonies.\n\n\n\n44\\. One should worship these virgins, taking their names and observing all\nthe rules. I am now mentioning the different results that arise from the\nworship of these nine classes of virgins.\n\n\n\n45\\. The worship of Kumari leads to the extinction of miseries and poverty, to\nthe extirpation of one\xc2\x92s enemies and the increment of riches, longevity and\npower.\n\n\n\n46\\. The Trimurti Puja yields longevity, and the acquisition of the three\nthings, Dharma, wealth, and desires, the coming in of riches, sons and\ngrandsons.\n\n\n\n47\\. Those who want learning, victory, kingdom and happiness, they should\nworship the Kalyani, the fructitier of all desires.\n\n\n\n48-49. Men should worship Rohi _n_ i duly for the cure of diseases. For the\ndestruction of enemies, the worship of the Kalika with devotion is the best.\nFor prosperity and riches, Chandika is to be worshipped with devotion. O king!\nFor the enchanting and overpowering of one\xc2\x92s enemies, for the removal of\nmiseries and poverty, and for victory in battles, S\xc2\x92ambhavi worship is the\nbest.\n\n\n\n50-51. For the destruction of awfully terrible enemies and for happiness in\nthe next world, the worship of Durga is the safest and best. People worship\nSubhadra when they want their desires to be fulfilled.\n\n\n\n52\\. People should, with great devotion, worship the Kumaris (virgins) with\nthe mantrams \xc2\x93S\xc2\x92rirastu\xc2\x94 or other mantrams, beginning with \xc2\x93S\xc2\x92ri\xc2\x94 or with the\nseed mantrams.\n\n\n\np. 229\n\n\n\n53\\. The Goddess who can create without any difficulty all the sacred tattvas\nof the Kumar Kartikeya and who effects, as if in sport, the creation of all\nthe Devas Brahma and others; I am worshiping the same Kumari Devi.\n\n\n\n54\\. She who is appearing under the three forms as differentiated by the three\ngu _n_ as Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas, and who is appearing in multiple forms,\nowing to the differentiations of the three gu _n_ as again into various minor\ndifferences, I am worshipping Her the Trimurti Devi.\n\n\n\n55\\. She who being worshipped always fares us with auspicious things, I am\nworshipping Her, with devotion, the Kumari Kalyani, the awarder of all\ndesires.\n\n\n\n56\\. I am worshipping the Rohi _n_ i Devi with a heart, full of devotion who\nis germinating all the karmas in seed forms, that have accumulated owing to\npast deeds.\n\n\n\n57\\. She who, at the end of a Kalpa gathers unto Her in the form of Kali all\nthis Universe, moving and unmoving, I worship that Kalika Devi with devotion.\n\n\n\n58\\. She, who is furious and wrathful and hence is called Chandika and who\nkilled the two Demons Cha _nd_ a and Mu _nd_ a I bow down to Her humbly with\ndevotion, to that Chandika Devi, who destroys the terrible sins.\n\n\n\n59\\. I worship that S\xc2\x92ambhavi Devi, the giver of all pleasures and happiness,\nwhose form is the Veda Brahma, and whose origin is without any cause, and whe\nis so recited in the Vedas.\n\n\n\n60\\. She who saves from danger her devotees and who always delivers from\nvarious difficulties and troubles, whom all the Devas are incapable to know, I\nworship with devotion that Durga Devi the destroyer of all calamities.\n\n\n\n61\\. I, with my mind devoted, offer my salutations to that Subhadra Devi, Who\nprocures all auspiciousness to Her devotees and removes all inauspicious\nincidents.\n\n\n\n62\\. Thus, in the mantrams, above described, people should always worship the\nvirgin girls, giving them clothings, ornaments, garlands, scents, and various\nother articles.\n\n\n\nHere ends the 26th Chapter on the narration of what are to be done in the\nNavaratri in the Maha Pura _n_ am in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18000 verses,\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 27](bk03ch27.htm)\n\n'
