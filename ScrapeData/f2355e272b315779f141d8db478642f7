 \nSo is it meet thou undertake  \nThis heavy task for duty's sake.'  \n\nThen he, of twice-born men the best,  \nHis glad assent at once expressed:  \n'Fain will I do whate'er may be  \nDesired, O honoured King, by thee.'  \nTo ancient priests he spoke, who, trained  \nIn holy rites, deep skill had gained:  \n'Here guards be stationed, good and sage  \nReligious men of trusted age.  \nAnd various workmen send and call,  \nWho frame the door and build the wall:  \nWith men of every art and trade,  \nWho read the stars and ply the spade,  \n\np. 21  \n\nAnd mimes and minstrels hither bring,  \nAnd damsels trained to dance and sing.'  \n\nThen to the learned men he said,  \nIn many a page of Scripture read:  \n'Be yours each rite performed to see  \nAccording to the king's decree.  \nAnd stranger Brahmans quickly call  \nTo this great rite that welcomes all.  \nPavilions for the princes, decked  \nWith art and ornament, erect,  \nAnd handsome booths by thousands made  \nThe Brahman visitors to shade,  \nArranged in order side by side,  \nWith meat and drink and all supplied.  \nAnd ample stables we shall need  \nFor many an elephant and steed:  \nAnd chambers where the men may lie,  \nAnd vast apartments, broad and high,  \nFit to receive the countless bands  \nOf warriors come from distant lands.  \nFor our own people too provide  \nSufficient tents, extended wide,  \nAnd stores of meat and drink prepare,  \nAnd all that can be needed there.  \nAnd food in plenty must be found  \nFor guests from all the country round.  \nOf various viands presents make,  \nFor honour, not for pity's sake,  \nThat fit regard and worship be  \nPaid to each caste in due degree.  \nAnd let not wish or wrath excite  \nYour hearts the meanest guest to slight;  \nBut still observe with special grace  \nThose who obtain the foremost place,  \nWhether for happier skill in art  \nOr bearing in the rite their part.  \nDo you, I pray, with friendly mind  \nPerform the task to you assigned,  \nAnd work the rite, as bids the law,  \nWithout omission, slip, or flaw'  \n\nThey answered: 'As thou seest fit  \nSo will we do and naught omit.'  \nThe sage Vas'ishtha then addressed  \nSumantra called at his behest:  \n'The princes of the earth invite,  \nAnd famous lords who guard the rite,  \nPriest, Warrior, Merchant, lowly thrall,  \nIn countless thousands summon all.  \nWhere'er their home be, far or near,  \nGather the good with honour here,  \nAnd Janak, whose imperial sway  \nThe men of Mithila  1 obey.  \nThe firm of vow, the dread of foes,  \nWho all the lore of Scripture knows,  \n\nInvite him here with honour high,  \nKing Das'aratha's old ally.  \nAnd Kas'i's  1b lord of gentle speech,  \nWho finds a pleasant word for each,  \nIn length of days our monarch's peer,  \nIllustrious king, invite him here.  \nThe father of our ruler's bride,  \nKnown for his virtues far and wide,  \nThe king whom Kekaya's  2b realms obey,  \nHim with his son invite, I pray.  \nAnd Lomapad the Angas' king,  \nTrue to his vows and godlike, bring.  \nFor be thine invitations sent  \nTo west and south and orient.  \nCall those who rule Surashtra's  3b land,  \nSuvira's  4b realm and Sindhu's strand,  \nAnd all the kings of earth beside  \nIn friendship's bonds with us allied:  \nInvite them all to hasten in  \nWith retinue and kith and kin.'  \n\nVas'ishtha's speech without delay  \nSumantra bent him to obey.  \nAnd sent his trusty envoys forth  \nEastward and westward, south and north.  \nObedient to the saint's request  \nHimself he hurried forth, and pressed  \nEach nobler chief and lord and king  \nTo hasten to the gathering.  \nBefore the saint Vas'ishtha stood  \nAll those who wrought with stone and wood,  \nAnd showed the work which every one  \nIn furtherance of the rite had done,  \nRejoiced their ready zeal to see,  \nThus to the craftsmen all said he:  \n'I charge ye, masters, see to this,  \nThat there be nothing done amiss,  \nAnd this, I pray, in mind be borne,  \nThat not one gift ye give in scorn:  \nWhenever scorn a gift attends  \nGreat sin is his who thus offends.'  \n\nAnd now some days and nights had past,  \nAnd kings began to gather fast,  \nAnd precious gems in liberal store  \nAs gifts to Das'aratha bore.  \nThen joy thrilled through Vas'ishtha's breast  \nAs thus the monarch he addressed:  \n'Obedient to thy high decree  \nThe kings, my lord, are come to thee.  \n\np. 22  \n\nAnd it has been my care to greet  \nAnd honour all with reverence meet.  \nThy servants' task is ended quite,  \nAnd all is ready for the rite.  \nCome forth then to the sacred ground  \nWhere all in order will be found.'  \nThen Rishyas'ring confirmed the tale:  \nNor did their words to move him fail.  \nThe stars propitious influence lent  \nWhen forth the world's great ruler went.  \n\nThen by the sage Vas'ishtha led  \n   The priest begun to speed  \nThose glorious rites wherein is shed  \n   The lifeblood of the steed.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[21:1](ry014.htm#fr_86) Called also Vidcha, later Tirabhukti, corrupted into\nthe modern Tirhut, a province bounded on the west and east by the Gaudaki and\nKaus'iki rivers, on the south by the Ganges, and on the north by the skirts of\nthe Himalayas.\n\n[21:1b](ry014.htm#fr_87) The celebrated city of Benares.
