 \nScarce might the Gods, arrayed for strife  \nBy Indra\'s self, escape, with life  \nAssailed by thy victorious hand:  \nAnd how may Bali hope to stand?  \nAll grief and care are past away,  \nAnd joyous thoughts my bosom sway,  \nWho have in thee a friend, renowned.  \nAs Varun  2 or as Indra, found.  \nThen on! subdue,--\'tis friendship\'s claim,--  \nMy foe who bears a brother\'s name.  \nStrike Bali down beneath thy feet:  \nWith suppliant hands I thus entreat,\'  \nSugriva ceased, and Rama pressed  \nThe grateful Vanar to his breast;  \nAnd thoughts of kindred feeling woke  \nIn Lakshman\'s bosom, as he spoke:  \n\'On to Kishkindha, on with speed!  \nThou, Vanar King, our way shalt lead,  \nThen challenge Bali forth to fight.  \nThy foe who scorns a brother\'s right.\'  \n   They sought Kishkindha\'s gate and stood  \nConcealed by trees in densest wood,  \nSugriva, to the fight addressed,  \nMore closely drew his cinctured vest,  \nAnd raised a wild sky-piercing shout  \n\np. 339  \n\nTo call the foeman Bali out.  \nForth came impetuous Bali, stirred  \nTo fury by the shout he heard.  \nSo the great sun, ere night has ceased,  \nSprings up impatient to the east.  \nThen fierce and wild the conflict raged  \nAs hand to hand the foes engaged,  \nAs though in battle mid the stars  \nFought Mercury and fiery Mars.  1  \nTo highest pitch of frenzy wrought  \nWith fists like thunderbolts they fought,  \nWhile near them Rama took his stand,  \nAnd viewed the battle, bow in hand.  \nAlike they stood in form and might,  \nLike heavenly As\'vins  2 paired in fight,  \nNor might the son of Raghu know  \nWhere fought the friend and where the foe;  \nSo, while his bow was ready bent.  \nNo life-destroying shaft he sent.  \nCrushed down by Bali\'s mightier stroke  \nSugriva\'s force now sank and broke,  \nWho, hoping naught from Rama\'s aid,  \nTo Rishyamuka fled dismayed,  \nWeary, and faint, and wounded sore,  \nHis body bruised and dyed with gore,  \nFrom Bali\'s blows, in rage and dread,  \nAfar to sheltering woods he fled.  \n   Nor Bali farther dared pursue,  \nThe curbing curse too well he knew.  \n\'Fled from thy death!\' the victor cried,  \nAnd home the mighty warrior hied.  \nHanuman, Lakshman, Raghu\'s son  \nBeheld the conquered Vanar run.  \nAnd followed to the sheltering shade  \nWhere yet Sugriva stood dismayed.  \nNear and more near the chieftains came,  \nThen, for intolerable shame,  \nNot daring yet to lift his eyes,  \nSugriva spoke with burning sighs:  \n\'Thy matchless strength I first beheld,  \nAnd dared my foe, by thee impelled.  \nWhy hast thou tried me with deceit  \nAnd urged me to a sure defeat?  \n\nThou shouldst have said, \'I will not slay  \nThy foeman in the coming fray.\'  \nFor had I then thy purpose known  \nI had not waged the fight alone.\'  \n   The Vanar sovereign, lofty-souled,  \nIn plaintive voice his sorrows told.  \nThen Rama spake: \'Sugriva, list,  \nAll anger from thy heart dismissed,  \nAnd I will tell the cause that stayed  \nMine arrow, and withheld the aid.  \nIn dress, adornment, port, and height,  \nIn splendour, battle-shout, and might,  \nNo shade of difference could I see  \nBetween thy foe, O King, and thee.  \nSo like was each, I stood at gaze,  \nMy senses lost in wildering maze,  \nNor loosened from my straining bow  \nA deadly arrow at the foe,  \nLest in my doubt the shaft should send  \nTo sudden death our surest friend.  \nO, if this hand in heedless guilt  \nAnd rash resolve thy blood had spilt,  \nThrough every land, O Vanar King,  \nMy wild and foolish act would ring,  \nSore weight of sin on him must lie  \nBy whom a friend is made to die;  \nAnd Lakshman, I, and Sita, best  \nOf dames, on thy protection rest.  \nOn, warrior! for the fight prepare;  \nNor fear again thy foe to dare.  \nWithin one hour thine eye shall view  \nMy arrow strike thy foeman through;  \nShall see the stricken Bali lie  \nLow on the earth, and gasp and die.  \nBut come, a badge about thee bind,  \nO monarch of the Vanar kind.  \nThat in the battle shock mine eyes  \nThe friend and foe may recognize.  \nCome, Lakshman, let that creeper deck  \nWith brightest bloom Sugriva\'s neck,  \nAnd be a happy token, twined  \nAround the chief of lofty mind.\'  \n   Upon the mountain slope there grew  \nA threading creeper fair to view,  \nAnd Lakshman plucked the bloom and round  \nSugriva\'s neck a garland wound,  \nGraced with the flowery wreath he wore,  \nThe Vanar chief the semblance bore  \nOf a dark cloud at close of day  \nEngarlanded with cranes at play,  \nIn glorious light the Vanar glowed  \nAs by his comrade\'s side he strode.  \nAnd, still on Rama\'s word intent,  \nHis steps to great Kishkindha bent.  \n\np. 340  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[338:1](ry286.htm#fr_574) The Bengal recension makes it return In the form of\na swan.\n\n[338:2](ry286.htm#fr_575) Varuna is one of the oldest of the Vedic Gods,\ncorresponding in name and partly in character to the \xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x81\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82 of the Greeks and\nis often regarded as the supreme deity.
