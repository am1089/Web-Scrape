For Vai _s_ vanara, the increaser of _Ri_ ta, for Agni we produce\n[1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:1:1) a Dhisha _n_ a [2](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:1:2) like\npurified ghee. And verily [3](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:1:3) by their prayer the\ninvoking men (accomplish) him, the Hot _ri_ , as the axe accomplishes a\nchariot.\n\n2\\. By his birth he has given splendour to both worlds (Heaven and Earth). He\nbecame the praiseworthy son of his parents, Agni, the carrier of oblations,\nnever ageing, with satisfied mind, undeceivable, the guest of men, rich in\nlight.\n\n3\\. Through the power of their mind, within the sphere of their superior\nstrength the gods have procreated Agni by their thoughts. Desirous of winning\nthe prize [1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:3:1) I address Him who shines with his\nsplendour, who is great in his light, as (one who desires to win the prize\naddresses his) race-horse.\n\n4\\. Desirous of winning the choice, glorious, and praiseworthy prize (which is\nthe gift) of the joy-giver, we choose the boon of the Bh _ri_ gus\n[1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:4:1), the U _s_ i _g_  [2](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:4:2),\nwho has the mind of a sage, Agni, who reigns with his heavenly light.\n\n5\\. Men, having spread the sacrificial grass, holding the sacrificial ladle,\nhave placed here in front (as Purohita), for the sake of (the divine)\nblessing, Agni renowned for strength, with great splendour, united with all\nthe gods, the Rudra of sacrifices [1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:5:1), who\naccomplishes the oblations of active (worshippers).\n\n6\\. O (Agni) whose flame is purifying, around thy\n\np. 229\n\ndwelling, O Hot _ri_ , the men who at the sacrifices have spread the\nsacrificial grass, O Agni, seeking (how to do) honour (to thee), and\n(desiring) thy friendship, surround thee (reverentially);--bestow thou wealth\non them!\n\n7\\. He has filled the two worlds (Heaven and Earth) and the great Sun, when\nthe active ones (i. e. the priests) held him fast who had been born. He the\nsage is led round for the performance of worship, like a racer for the winning\nof the prize [1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:7:1), with satisfied mind.\n\n8\\. Adore ye him, the giver of offerings, the best performer of worship;\nhonour ye him the domestic _G_ atavedas. Agni, the charioteer of the mighty\n_Ri_ ta, he who dwells among manifold tribes, has become the Purohita of the\ngods.\n\n9\\. The immortal U _s_ i _g_ s have purified three logs for the vigorous\n[1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:9:1) Agni [2](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:9:2) who wanders\nround the earth [3](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:9:3): of these they have placed one\namong the mortals for their enjoyment; two have passed into the sister world\n[4](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:9:4).\n\n10\\. The food offered by men has sharpened him, the sage of the tribes, the\nlord of the tribes, as an axe. Busily he goes to the heights and to the\ndepths. He has held fast the germ in these worlds.\n\n11\\. He the generator, the strong one, stirs in the resplendent bellies like a\nroaring lion, Vai _s_ vanara with his broad stream of light, the immortal,\ndistributing goods and treasures to his worshipper.\n\n12\\. Vai _s_ vanara has mounted the firmament, the back of heaven, as of old,\nglorified by those who are rich in good thoughts. He, creating wealth for the\ncreatures as of old, goes watchful round the common course.\n\np. 230\n\n13\\. The righteous, worshipful priest deserving of praise, the dweller in\nheaven [1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:13:1) whom Matari _s_ van has established (on\nearth): him we approach whose way is bright and hair golden, the resplendent\nAgni, for the sake of ever new welfare.\n\n14\\. Like the flaming one (the sun?) on his way, the quick one, of sun-like\naspect, the banner of heaven, who dwells in light, who wakes at dawn--Agni the\nhead of heaven, the unrepressed, him we approach with adoration, the strong\none mightily.\n\n15\\. The joy-giving, bright Hot _ri_ , in whom is no falsehood, the domestic,\npraiseworthy dweller among all tribes, like a splendid chariot, wonderful to\nbehold, established by Manus: him we constantly approach for the sake of\nwealth.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi.
