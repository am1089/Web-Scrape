The\ndivisions adopted by Saya _n_ a, who explains the Upanishad as part of the \xc3\x82ra\n_n_ yaka, and by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, who explains it independently, vary, though Saya\n_n_ a states that he follows in his commentary on the Upanishad the earlier\ncommentary of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara. I have given the divisions adopted by Saya _n_ a,\nand have marked those of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's by figures in parentheses, placed at the\nend of each paragraph. The difference between this Upanishad and the three\npreceding adhyayas is easily perceived. Hitherto the answer to the question,\nWhence this world? had been, From Pra _n_ a, pra _n_ a meaning breath and\nlife, which was looked upon for a time as a sufficient explanation of all that\nis. From a psychological point of view this pra _n_ a is the conscious self\n(pra _g_ \xc3\xb1atman); in a more mythological form it appears as Hira _n_ yagarbha,\n'the golden germ,' sometimes even as Indra. It is one of the chief objects of\nthe pra _n_ avidya, or life-knowledge, to show that the living principle in us\nis the same as the living principle in the sun, and that by a recognition of\ntheir identity and of the true nature of pra _n_ a, the devotee, or he who has\nrightly meditated on pra _n_ a during his life, enters after death into the\nworld of Hira _n_ yagarbha.\n\nThis is well expressed in the Kaushitaki-upanishad III, 2, where Indra says to\nPratardana: 'I am Pra _n_ a; meditate on me as the conscious self (pra _g_\n\xc3\xb1atman), as life, as immortality. Life is pra _n_ a, pra _n_ a is life.\nImmortality is pra _n_ a, pra _n_ a is immortality. By pra _n_ a he obtains\nimmortality in the other world, by knowledge (pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a) true conception. Pra\n_n_ a is consciousness (pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a), consciousness is pra _n_ a.'\n\nThis, however, though it may have satisfied the mind of the Brahmans for a\ntime, was not a final solution. That final solution of the problem not simply\nof life, but of existence, is given in the Upanishad which teaches that \xc3\x82tman,\nthe Self, and not Pra _n_ a, Life, is the last and only cause of everything.\nIn some places this\n\np. 237\n\ndoctrine is laid down in all its simplicity. Our true self, it is said, has\nits true being in the Highest Self only. In other passages, however, and\nnearly in the whole of this Upanishad, this simple doctrine is mixed up with\nmuch that is mythological, fanciful, and absurd, arthavada, as the\ncommentators call it, but as it might often be more truly called, anarthavada,\nand it is only towards the end that the identity of the self-conscious self\nwith the Highest Self or Brahman is clearly enuntiated.\n\n\n\nAdoration to the Highest Self. Hari, Om!\n\n1\\. Verily, in the beginning 1 all this was Self, one only; there was nothing\nelse blinking 2 whatsoever.\n\n2\\. He thought: 'Shall I send forth worlds?' (1) He sent forth these worlds,\n\n3\\. Ambhas (water), Mari _k_ i (light), Mara (mortal), and Ap (water).\n\n4\\. That Ambhas (water) is above the heaven, and it is heaven, the support.\nThe Mari _k_ is (the lights) are the sky. The Mara (mortal) is the earth, and\nthe waters under the earth are the Ap world 3. (2)\n\np. 238\n\n5\\. He thought: 'There are these worlds; shall I send forth guardians of the\nworlds?'\n\nHe then formed the Purusha (the person) 1, taking him forth from the water 2.\n(3)\n\n6\\. He brooded on him 3, and when that person had thus been brooded on, a\nmouth burst forth 4 like an egg. From the mouth proceeded speech, from speech\nAgni (fire) 5.\n\nNostrils burst forth. From the nostrils proceeded scent (pra _n_ a) 6, from\nscent Vayu (air).\n\nEyes burst forth. From the eyes proceeded sight, from sight \xc3\x82ditya (sun).\n\nEars burst forth. From the ears proceeded hearing, from hearing the Di _s_\n(quarters of the world),\n\nSkin burst forth. From the skin proceeded hairs (sense of touch), from the\nhairs shrubs and trees.\n\nThe heart burst forth. From the heart proceeded mind, from mind _K_ andramas\n(moon).\n\nThe navel burst forth. From the navel proceeded the Apana (the down-breathing)\n7, from Apana death.\n\np. 239\n\nThe generative organ burst forth. From the organ proceeded seed, from seed\nwater.

X, 190,\n2, vi _s_ vasya mishato va _s_ i, the lord of all living. Saya _n_ a seems to\ntake mishat as a 3rd pers. sing.\n\n[237:3](sbe01222.htm#fr_587) The names of the four worlds are peculiar. Ambhas\nmeans water, and is the name given to the highest world, the waters above the\nheaven, and heaven itself. Mari _k_ is are rays, here used as a name of the\nsky, antariksha. Mara means dying, and the earth is called so, because all\ncreatures living there must die. Ap is water, here explained as the waters\nunder the earth. The usual division of the world is threefold, earth, sky, and\nheaven. Here it is fourfold, the fourth division being the water round the\nearth, or, as the commentator says, under the earth. Ambhas was probably\nintended for the highest heaven (dyaus), and was then explained both as what\nis above the heaven and as heaven itself, the support. If we translate, like\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara and Colebrooke, I the water is the region above the heaven which\nheaven upholds,' we should lose heaven altogether, yet heaven, as the third\nwith sky and earth, is essential in the Indian view of the world.\n\n[238:1](sbe01222.htm#fr_588) Purusha; an embodied being, Colebrooke; a being\nof human shape, Roer; purushakaram vira _t_ pi _n_ _d_ am, Saya _n_ a.\n\n[238:2](sbe01222.htm#fr_589) According to the commentator, from the five\nelements, beginning with water. That person is meant for the Vira _g_.\n\n[238:3](sbe01222.htm#fr_590) Tap, as the commentator observes, does not mean\nhere and in similar passages to perform austerities (tapas), such as the K\n_ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra, the _K_ andraya _n_ a, &c., but to conceive and to will and\nto create by mere will. I have translated it by brooding, though this\nexpresses a part only of the meaning expressed by tap.\n\n[238:4](sbe01222.htm#fr_591) Literally, was opened.\n\n[238:5](sbe01222.htm#fr_592) Three things are always distinguished here--the\nplace of each sense, the instrument of the sense, and the presiding deity of\nthe sense.\n\n[238:6](sbe01222.htm#fr_593) Pra _n_ a, i. e. ghra _n_ endriya, must be\ndistinguished from the pra _n_ a, the up-breathing, one of the five pra _n_\nas, and likewise from the pra _n_ a as the principle of life.\n\n[238:7](sbe01222.htm#fr_594) The Apana, down-breathing, is generally one of\nthe five vital airs p. 239 which are supposed to keep the body alive. in our\nplace, however, apana is deglutition and digestion, as we shall see in II, 4,\n3, 10.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 2](sbe01223.htm)\n\n"
