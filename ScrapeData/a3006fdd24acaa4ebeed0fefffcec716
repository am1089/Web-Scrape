The one within (the sun and the eye); on account of his qualities being\ndeclared.\n\nIt is said in the _Kh_ andogya: 'Now that person bright as gold, who is seen\nwithin the sun, with beard bright as gold and hair bright as gold, golden\naltogether to the very tips of his nails, whose eyes are like blue lotus; his\nname is Ut, for he has risen (udita) above all evil. He also who knows this\nrises above all evil. _Ri_ k and Saman are his joints.- So much with reference\nto the devas.--Now with reference to the body.--Now that person who is seen\nwithin the eye, he is _Ri_ k, he is Saman, Uktha, Ya _g_ us, Brahman. The form\nof this person (in the eye) is the same as of that person yonder (in the sun),\nthe joints of the one are the\n\np. 238\n\njoints of the other, the name of the one is the--name of the other' ( _Kh._\nUp. I, 7).--Here there arises the doubt whether that person dwelling within\nthe eye and the sun be the individual soul called \xc3\x82ditya, who through\naccumulation of religious merit possesses lordly power, or the highest Self\nother than that soul.\n\nThat individual soul of high merit, the Purvapakshin maintains. For the text\nstates that that person has a body, and connexion with a body belongs to\nindividual souls only, for it is meant to bring the soul into contact with\npleasure and pain, according to its deserts. It is for this reason that\nScripture describes final Release where there is no connexion with works as a\nstate of disembodiedness. 'So long as he is in the body he cannot get free\nfrom pleasure and pain. But when he is free from the body, then neither\npleasure nor pain touches him' ( _Kh._ Up. VIII, 12, 1). And a soul of\ntranscendent merit may possess surpassing wisdom and power, and thus be\ncapable of being lord of the worlds and the wishes (I, 6, 8). For the same\nreason such a soul may be the object of devout meditation, bestow rewards, and\nby being instrumental in destroying evil, be helpful towards final release.\nEven among men some are seen to be of superior knowledge and power, owing to\nsuperior religious merit; and this holds good with regard to the Siddhas and\nGandharvas also; then with regard to the devas; then with regard to the divine\nbeings, beginning with Indra. Hence, also, one among the divine beings,\nbeginning with Brahma, may in each kalpa reach, through a particularly high\ndegree of merit, vast lordly power and thus effect the creation of the world,\nand so on. On this supposition the texts about that which constitutes the\ncause of the world and the inward Self of the world must also be understood to\nrefer to some such soul which, owing to superiority of merit, has become all-\nknowing and all-powerful. A so-called highest Self, different from the\nindividual souls, does not therefore exist. Where the texts speak of that\nwhich is neither coarse nor fine nor short, &c., they only mean to\ncharacterise the individual soul; and those texts also which refer to final\n\np. 239\n\n[paragraph continues] Release aim only at setting forth the essential nature\nof the individual soul and the means of attaining that essential nature.\n\nThis prima facie view is set aside by the Sutra. The person who is perceived\nwithin the sun and within the eye, is something different from the individual\nsoul, viz. the highest Self; because there are declared qualities belonging to\nthat. The text ascribes to him the quality of having risen above, i.e. being\nfree from all evil, and this can belong to the highest Self only, not to the\nindividual soul. For to be free from all evil means to be free from all\ninfluence of karman, and this quality can belong to the highest Self only,\ndiffering from all individual souls which, as is shown by their experience of\npleasure and pain, are in the bonds of karman. Those essential qualities also\nwhich presuppose freedom from all evil (and which are mentioned in other Vedic\npassages), such as mastery over all worlds and wishes, capability of realising\none's purposes, being the inner Self of all, &c., belong to the highest Self\nalone. Compare passages such as 'It is the Self free from evil, free from old\nage, from death and grief, from hunger and thirst, whose wishes come true,\nwhose purposes come true' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 5); and 'He is the inner Self\nof all, free from evil, the divine one, the one god Naraya _n_ a' (Suba. Up.).\nAttributes such as the attribute of being the creator of the whole universe--\nwhich presupposes the power of realising one's wishes--(cp. the passage 'it\ndesired, may I be many'); the attribute of being the cause of fear and\nfearlessness; the attribute of enjoying transcending bliss not limited by the\ncapabilities of thought and speech and the like, are essential characteristics\nof that only which is not touched by karman, and they cannot therefore belong\nto the individual soul.--Nor is there any truth in the contention that the\nperson within the sun, &c., cannot be a being different from individual souls\nbecause it possesses a body. For since a being which possesses the power of\nrealising all its desires can assume a body through its mere wish, it is not\ngenerally true that embodiedness proves dependence on karman.--But, it may be\nsaid, by a body we understand\n\np. 240\n\na certain combination of matter which springs from the primal substance (prak\n_ri_ ti) with its three constituents. Now connexion with such a body cannot\npossibly be brought about by the wish of such souls even as are free from all\nevil and capable of realising their desires; for such connexion would not be\nto the soul's benefit. In the case, on the other hand, of a soul subject to\nkarman and not knowing its own essential nature, such connexion with a body\nnecessarily takes place in order that the soul may enjoy the fruit of its\nactions--quite apart from the soul's desire.--Your objection would be well\nfounded, we reply, if the body of the highest Self were an effect of Prak _ri_\nti with its three constituents; but it is not so, it rather is a body suitable\nto the nature and intentions of that Self. The highest Brahman, whose nature\nis fundamentally antagonistic to all evil and essentially composed of infinite\nknowledge and bliss--whereby it differs from all other souls--possesses an\ninfinite number of qualities of unimaginable excellence, and, analogously, a\ndivine form suitable to its nature and intentions, i.e. adorned with infinite,\nsupremely excellent and wonderful qualities--splendour, beauty, fragrance,\ntenderness, loveliness, youthfulness, and so on. And in order to gratify his\ndevotees he individualises that form so as to render it suitable to their\napprehension--he who is a boundless ocean as it were of compassion, kindness\nand lordly power, whom no shadow of evil may touch---he who is the highest\nSelf, the highest Brahman, the supreme soul, Naraya _n_ a!--Certain texts tell\nus that the highest Brahman is the sole cause of the entire world: 'From which\nthese beings originate' (Taitt. Up.); 'Being only was this in the beginning'\n(Kh. Up. VI, 2, 1); 'The Self only was this in the beginning' (Ai. Up. I, 1);\n'Naraya _n_ a alone existed, not Brahma nor Siva.' Other texts define his\nnature: 'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1);\n'Knowledge, bliss is Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. III. 9. 28); and others again deny\nof Brahman all connexion with evil qualities and inferior bodies sprung from\nPrak _ri_ ti, and all dependence on karman, and proclaim his glorious\nqualities and glorious forms: 'Free from\n\np. 241\n\nqualities' (?); 'Free from taint' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 19); 'Free from old age,\nfrom death and grief, from hunger and thirst, realising his wishes and\npurposes' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 5); 'There is no effect and no cause known of\nhim, no one is seen like to him or superior: his high power is revealed as\nmanifold, as inherent action of force and knowledge' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 8);\n'That highest great lord of lords, the highest deity of deities' ( _S_ vet.\nUp. VI, 7); 'He is the cause, the lord of the lords of the organs, and there\nis of him neither parent nor lord' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 9); 'Having created all\nforms and given names to them the wise one goes on calling them by those\nnames' (Taitt. \xc3\x82r. III, 12, 7); 'I know that great Person of sunlike lustre\nbeyond the darkness' ( _S_ vet. Up. III, 8); 'All moments originated from the\nPerson shining like lightning' (Mahanar. Up. I, 6).--This essential form of\nhis the most compassionate Lord by his mere will individualises as a shape\nhuman or divine or otherwise, so as to render it suitable to the apprehension\nof the devotee and thus satisfy him. This the following scriptural passage\ndeclares, 'Unborn he is born in many ways' (Gau. Ka. III, 24); and likewise Sm\n_ri_ ti. 'Though unborn I, the imperishable Self, the Lord of the beings,\npresiding over my Nature, manifest myself by my Maya for the protection of the\nGood and the destruction of the evil doers '(Bha. Gi. IV, 6. 8). The 'Good'\nhere are the Devotees; and by 'Maya' is meant the purpose, the knowledge of\nthe Divine Being--; in agreement with the Naigha _nt_ ukas who register 'Maya'\nas a synonym of _g \xc3\xb1_ana (knowledge). In the Mahabharata also the form assumed\nby the highest Person in his avataras is said not to consist of Prakriti, 'the\nbody of the highest Self does not consist of a combination of material\nelements.'--For these reasons the Person within the Sun and the eye is the\nhighest Self which is different from the individual soul of the Sun,&c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 22.
