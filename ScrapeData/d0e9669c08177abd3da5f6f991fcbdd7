The Maruts charged with rain [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:1), endowed with\nfierce force, terrible like wild beasts [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:2), blazing\n[3](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:3) in their strength [4](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:4),\nbrilliant like fires, and impetuous [5](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:5), have\nuncovered the (rain-giving) cows by blowing away the cloud\n[6](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:6).\n\n2\\. The (Maruts) with their rings [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:2:1) appeared like\nthe heavens with their stars [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:2:2), they shone wide\nlike streams from clouds as soon as Rudra, the strong man, was born for you, O\ngolden-breasted Maruts, in the bright lap of P _ri_ _s_ ni\n[3](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:2:3).\n\n3\\. They wash [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:1) their horses like racers in the\ncourses, they hasten with the points of the reed [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:2)\non their quick steeds. O golden jawed [3](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:3) Maruts,\nviolently shaking (your jaws), you go quick [4](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:4) with\nyour spotted deer [5](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:5), being friends of one mind.\n\n4\\. Those Maruts have grown to feed [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:4:1) all these\nbeings, or, it may be, (they have come) hither for the sake of a friend, they\nwho always bring quickening rain. They have spotted horses, their bounties\ncannot be taken away, they are like headlong charioteers on their ways\n[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:4:2).\n\n5\\. O Maruts, wielding your brilliant spears, come hither on smooth\n[1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:5:1) roads with your fiery\n[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:5:2) cows (clouds) whose udders are swelling; (come\nhither), being of one mind, like swans toward their nests, to enjoy the sweet\noffering.\n\n6\\. O one-minded Maruts, come to our prayers, come to our libations like\n(Indra) praised by men [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:6:1)!\n\np. 296\n\n[paragraph continues] Fulfil (our prayer) like the udder of a barren cow\n[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:6:2), and make the prayer glorious by booty to the\nsinger.\n\n7\\. Grant us this strong horse for our chariot, a draught\n[1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:7:1) that rouses our prayers, from day to day, food to\nthe singers, and to the poet in our homesteads [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:7:2)\nluck [3](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:7:3), wisdom, inviolable and invincible strength.\n\n8\\. When the gold-breasted Maruts harness the horses to their chariots,\nbounteous [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:8:1) in wealth, then it is as if a cow in\nthe folds poured out [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:8:2) to her calf copious food, to\nevery man who has offered libations.\n\n9\\. Whatever mortal enemy may have placed us among wolves\n[1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:9:1), shield us from hurt, ye Vasus! Turn the wheels\nwith burning heat[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:9:2) against him, and strike down the\nweapon of the impious fiend, O Rudras!\n\n10\\. Your march, O Maruts, appears brilliant, whether even friends have milked\nthe udder of P _ri_ _s_ ni, or whether, O sons of Rudra, you mean to blame him\nwho praises you, and to weaken those who are weakening Trita, O unbeguiled\nheroes [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:10:1).\n\n11\\. We invoke you, the great Maruts, the constant wanderers, at the offering\nof the rapid Vish _n_ u [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:11:1); holding ladles (full of\nlibations) and prayerful we ask the golden-coloured and exalted Maruts for\nglorious wealth.\n\n12\\. The Da _s_ agvas (Maruts?) [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:12:1) carried on\n[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:12:2) the sacrifice first; may they rouse us at the\nbreak of dawn. Like the dawn, they uncover the dark nights with the red\n(rays), the strong ones, with their brilliant light, as with a sea of milk.\n\n13\\. With the (morning) clouds, as if with glittering red ornaments\n[1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:13:1), these Maruts have grown great in the sacred\nplaces [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:13:2). Streaming down with rushing\n\np. 297\n\nsplendour [3](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:13:3), they have assumed their bright and\nbrilliant colour.\n\n14\\. Approaching [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:14:1) them for their great protection\nto help us, we invoke them with this worship, they whom Trita may bring near,\nlike the five Hot _ri_ priests for victory [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:14:2),\ndescending on their chariot to help.\n\n15\\. May that grace of yours by which you help the wretched\n[1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:15:1) across all anguish, and by which you deliver the\nworshipper from the reviler, come hither, O Maruts; may your favour approach\nus like a cow (going to her calf)!\n\np. 298\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nHymn ascribed to G _ri_ tsamada. Metre, 1-14 Gagati, 15 Trish _t_ ubh,\naccording to the paribhasha in the Sarvanukrama _n_ i 12, 13. See also Ludwig,\nIII, p. 59; Bergaigne, Recherches sur l'histoire de la liturgie vedique, 1889,\npp. 66 seq.; Oldenberg, Prolegomena, p. 144. None of its verses occurs in SV.,\nVS., AV. The first verse is found in TB. II, 5, 5, 4, with three various\nreadings, viz. tavishebhir urmibhi _h_ instead of tavishibhir ar _k_ ina _h_ ,\nbhrumim instead of bh _r i_mim, and ripa instead of apa.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Dharavara\xc2\xb4 _h_ , a word of doubtful import, possibly meaning wishing\nfor rain, or the suitors of the streams of rain. The Maruts are sometimes\nrepresented as varas or suitors; cf. V, 60, 4.\n\nNote 2. Cf. II, 33, 11.\n\nNote 3. Bergaigne, II, 381, translates ar _k_ ina _h_ by chantres, singers,\nderiving it, as it would seem, from arka which, as he maintains (Journ. Asiat.\n1884, IV, pp. 194 seq.), means always song in the RV. (Rel. Ved. I, 279).\nThis, however, is not the case, as has been well shown by Pischel, Ved. Stud.\nI, pp. 23 seq. Besides, unless we change ar _k_ ina _h_ into arki _n_ a _h_ ,\nwe must connect it with ar _k_ i, light. Thus we read VIII, 41, 8, ar _k_ ina\npada\xc2\xb4.\n\nNote 4. Tavishebhir urmibhi _h_ , the reading of the Taittiriyas, is explained\nby Saya _n_ a by balavadbhir gamanai _h_. It may have been taken from RV. VI,\n61, 2.\n\nNote 5. On ri _g_ ishin, see I, 64, 125; I, 87, I.\n\nNote 6. Bh _r i_mi seems to me a name of the cloud, driven about by the wind.\nThe Taittiriyas read bhrumim, and Saya _n_ a explains it by megha _m_\ndharnanta _s_ _k_ alayanta _h_. In most passages, no doubt, bh _ri_ mi means\nquick, fresh, and is opposed to radhra, IV, 32, 2; VII, 56, 20. In I, 31, 16,\nas applied to Agni, it may mean quick. But in our passage that meaning is\nimpossible, and I prefer the traditional\n\np. 299\n\nmeaning of cloud to that of storm-wind, adopted by Benfey and Roth. The\nexpression 'to blow a storm-wind' is not usual, while dham is used in the\nsense of blowing away clouds and darkness. The cows would then be the waters\nin the clouds. It is possible, however, that Saya _n_ a's explanation,\naccording to which bh _ri_ mi is a musical instrument, may rest on some\ntraditional authority. In this case it would correspond to dhamanta _h_ va _n_\nam, in I, 85, 102.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On khadin, see I, 166, 9, note 2. On rukma-vakshas, I, 64, 4, note 1.\nGolden-breasted is meant for armed with golden chest-plates. The meaning seems\nto be that the Maruts with their brilliant khadis appear like the heavens with\ntheir brilliant stars. The Maruts are not themselves lightning and rain, but\nthey are seen in them, as Agni is not the fire, but present in the fire, or\nthe god of fire. Thus we read, RV. III, 26, 6. agne _h_ bha\xc2\xb4mam marutam o _g_\na _h_ , 'The splendour of Agni, the strength of the Maruts,' i. e. the\nlightning. It must be admitted, however, that a conjecture, proposed by\nBollensen (Z. D. M. G. XLI, p. 501), would improve the verse. He proposes to\nread _ri_ sh _t_ aya _h_ instead of v _ri_ sh _t_ aya _h_. We should then have\nto translate, 'Their spears shone like lightnings from the clouds.' These _ri_\nsh _t_ is or spears are mentioned by the side of khadi and rukma in RV. V, 54,\n11, and the compound _ri_ sh _t_ ividyuta _h_ is applied to the Maruts in I,\n168, 5 and V, 52, 13. The difficulty which remains is abhriya _h_.\n\nNote 2. On dya\xc2\xb4vo na st _ri_ bhi _h_ , see note to I, 87, 1.\n\nNote 3. The second line is full of difficulties. No doubt the Maruts are\nrepresented as the sons of Rudra (V, 60, 5; VI, 66, 3), and as the sons of P\n_ri_ _s_ ni, fem., being called P _r i_ _s_ ni-matara _h_. Their birth is\nsometimes spoken of as unknown (VII, 56, 2), but hardly as mysterious. Who\nknows their birth, hardly means more than 'the wind bloweth where it listeth,\nand thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh.' P\n_ri_ _s_ ni as a feminine is the speckled sky, and the cloud may have been\nconceived\n\np. 300\n\nas the udder at the same time that P _ri_ _s_ ni was conceived as a cow (I,\n160, 3). Nothing seems therefore more natural than that we should translate,\n'When Rudra had begotten you in the bright lap of P _ri_ _s_ ni.' The bright\nlap, _s_ ukram u\xc2\xb4dha _h_ , is an idiomatic expression (VI, 66, 1; IV, 3, 10),\nand I see no reason why we should with Roth, K. Z. XXVI, 49, change the _s_\nukre of the padapa _th_ a into _s_ ukra _h_ and refer it to v _r i_sha.\n\nThe real difficulty lies in a _g_ ani. Can it mean he begot, as Bergaigne\n(Religion Vedique, III, 35) interprets it? Wherever a _g_ ani occurs it means\nhe was born, and I doubt whether it can mean anything else. It is easy to\nsuggest a _g_ anit, for though the third person of the aorist never occurs in\nthe RV., the other persons, such as a _g_ anish _t_ a, _g_ anish _th_ a _h_ ,\nare there. But, as the verse now stands, we must translate, 'When Rudra was\nborn for you, he the strong one in the bright udder of P _ri_ _s_ ni.' Could\nRudra be here conceived as the son, he who in other passages is represented as\nthe husband of P _ri_ _s_ ni? There is another passage which may yield the\nsame sense, VI, 66, 3. vide hi mata\xc2\xb4 maha _h_ mahi\xc2\xb4 sa\xc2\xb4, sa\xc2\xb4 it p _r i_ _s_ ni\n_h_ subhve\xcc\x83 garbham a\xc2\xb4 adhat, 'for she, the great, is known as the mother of\nthe great, that very P _ri_ _s_ ni conceived the germ (the Maruts) for the\nstrong one.'\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Ukshante is explained by washing, cleaning the horses, before they\nstart for a new race. See V, 59, I. ukshante a _s_ van, followed by tarushante\na\xc2\xb4 ra _g_ a _h_ ; IX, 109, 10. a _s_ va _h_ na nikta _h_ va _g_ i\xc2\xb4 dhanaya;\n_S_ atap. Br. XI, 5, 5, 13. Pischel (Ved. Stud. I, 189) supposes that it\nalways refers to the washing after a race.\n\nNote 2. Nadasya kar _n_ ai _h_ is very difficult. Saya _n_ a's explanation,\nmeghasya madhyaprade _s_ ai _h_ , 'through the hollows of the cloud,'\npresupposes that nada by itself can in the RV. be used in the sense of cloud,\nand that kar _n_ a, ear, may have the meaning of a hole or a passage. To take,\nas BR. propose, kar _n_ a in the sense of kar _n_ a, eared, with long ears,\nwould not help us much. Grassmann's\n\np. 301\n\ntranslation, 'mit der Wolke schnellen Fittigen,' is based on a conjectural\nreading, nadasya par _n_ ai _h_. Ludwig's translation, 'mit des fluszes wellen\nden raschen eilen sie,' is ingenious, but too bold, for kar _n_ a never means\nwaves, nor nada river in the Rig-veda. The Vedarthayatna gives: 'they rush\nwith steeds that make the roar,' taking kar _n_ ai _h_ for kart _ri_ bhi _h_ ,\nwhich again is simply impossible. The best explanation is that suggested by\nPischel, Ved. Stud., p. 189. He takes nada for reed, and points out that whips\nwere made of reeds. The kar _n_ a would be the sharp point of the reed, most\nuseful for a whip. I cannot, however, follow him in taking a _s_ ubhi _h_ in\nthe sense of accelerating. I think it refers to a _s_ va in the preceding\npada.\n\nNote 3. Hira _n_ ya _s_ ipra _h_. _S_ ipra, in the dual _s_ ipre, is intended\nfor the jaws, the upper and lower jaws, as in RV. I, 101, 10. vi syasva _s_\nipre, open the jaws. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 249, note. RV. III,\n32, I; V, 36, 2, _s_ ipre and hanu; VIII, 76, 10); X, 96, 9. _s_ ipre hari _n_\ni davidhvata _h_ ; X, 105, 5. _s_ iprabhyam _s_ ipri _n_ ivan. In the plural,\nhowever, _s_ ipra _h_ , V, 54, 11 ( _s_ ipra _h_ _s_ irshasu vitata _h_ hira\n_n_ yayi _h_ ), VIII, 7, 25, is intended for something worn on the head, made\nof gold or gold threads. As we speak of the ears of a cap, that is, lappets\nwhich protect the ears, or of the cheeks of a machine, so in this case the\njaws seem to have been intended for what protects the jaws, and not\nnecessarily for the real jaw-bones of an animal; used as an helmet, and\nafterwards imitated in any kind of metal. As to _s_ iprin it may mean helmeted\nor possessed of jaws. To be possessed of jaws is no peculiar distinction, yet\nin several of the passages where _s_ iprin occurs, there is a clear reference\nto eating and drinking; see VI, 44, 14; VIII, 2, 28; 17, 4; 32, 24; 33, 7; 92,\n4; see also _s_ ipravan in VI, 17, 2. It is possible therefore that like su\n_s_ ipra, _s_ iprin also was used in the sense of possessed of jaw-bones, i.\ne. of strong jaw-bones. Even such epithets as hira _n_ ya- _s_ ipra, hari- _s_\nipra, hiri- _s_ ipra may mean possessed of golden, possibly of strong jaws.\n(M. M., Biographies of Words, p. 263, note.) Roth takes hari _s_ ipra as\nyellow-jawed, hiri _s_ ipra as golden-cheeked, or with golden helmet, hira _n_\nya _s_ ipra, with golden\n\np. 302\n\nhelmet. A decision between golden-jawed or golden-helmeted is difficult, yet\ngolden-jawed is applicable in all cases.\n\nIn our passage we must be guided by davidhvata _h_ , which together with _s_\nipra occurs again X, 96, 9. _s_ ipre va\xc2\xb4 _g_ aya hari _n_ i davidhvata _h_ ,\nshaking the golden jaws, and it seems best to translate: O ye golden-jawed\nMaruts, shaking (your jaws), you go to feed.\n\nNote 4. If we retain the accent in p _ri_ ksham, we shall have to take it as\nan adverb, from p _ri_ ksha, quick, vigorous, like the German snel. This view\nis supported by Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, 96. If, however, we could change the\naccent into p _r i_ksham, we might defend Saya _n_ a's interpretation. We\nshould have to take p _r i_ksham as the accusative of p _ri_ ksh,\ncorresponding to the dative p _ri_ kshe in the next verse. P _ri_ ksh is used\ntogether with _s_ ubh, ish, ur _g_ (VI, 62, 4), and as we have _s_ ubham ya,\nwe might take p _r i_ksham ya in the sense of going for food, in search of\nfood. But it is better to take p _ri_ ksham as an adverb. In the next verse p\n_ri_ kshe is really a kind of infinitive, governing bhuvana.\n\nNote 5. Tradition explains the P _ri_ shatis as spotted deer, but p _ri_ shada\n_s_ va, as an epithet of the Maruts, need not mean having P _ri_ shatis for\ntheir horses, but having spotted horses. See Bergaigne, Rel. Ved. II, p. 378,\nnote.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Ludwig translates: Zu narung haben sie alle dise wesen gebracht;\nGrassmann: Zur Labung netzten alle diese Wesen sie. Ludwig suggests _k_ itraya\nfor mitraya; Oldenberg, far better, mitrayava _h_ , looking for friends, like\nmitrayuva _h_ , in I, 173, 10.\n\nNote 2. On vayuna, see Pischel in Vedische Studien, p. 301. But why does\nPischel translate _ri_ _g_ ipya by bulls, referring to VI, 67, 11?\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Adhvasmabhi _h_ seems to mean unimpeded or smooth. Cf. IX, 91, 3.\n\nNote 2. The meaning of indhanvabhi _h_ is very doubtful.\n\np. 303\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Nara\xc2\xb4 _m_ na sa _m_ sa _h_ , the original form of Nara _s_ a _m_ sa\n_h_ , I take here as a proper name, Mannerlob (like Frauenlob, the poet)\nreferring to Indra. Bergaigne, I, p. 305, doubts whether Nara _s_ a _m_ sa can\nbe a proper name in our passage, but on p. 308 he calls it an appellation of\nIndra.\n\nNote 2. \xc3\x81 _s_ vam iva, gives a sense, but one quite inappropriate to the Veda.\nIt would mean, 'fill the cow in her udder like a mare.' I therefore propose to\nread asva\xcc\x83m iva (asuam iva), from asu, a cow that is barren, or a cow that has\nnot yet calved. Thus we read, I, 112, 3. ya\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ dhenum asva\xcc\x83m pinvatha _h_\n, 'with the same help with which you nourish a barren cow.' Cf. I, 116, 22.\nstarya\xcc\x83m pipyathu _h_ ga\xc2\xb4m, 'you have filled the barren cow.' If asva\xcc\x83m iva\ndhenum is a simile, we want an object to which it refers, and this we find in\ndhiyam. Thus we read, V, 71, 2; VII, 94, 2; IX, 19, 2, pipyatam dhiya _h_ , to\nfulfil prayers. I know, of course, that such changes in the sacred text will\nfor the present seem most objectionable to my friends in India, but I doubt\nnot that the time will come when they will see that such emendations are\ninevitable. I see that in the appendix to the Petersburg Dictionary, s. v.\nasu, the same conjecture has been suggested.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Here again I have taken great liberties. \xc3\x82panam is explained by Saya\n_n_ a as a participle for apnuvantam. This participle, though quite correct\n(see Lindner, Altindische Nominalbildung, p. 54), does not occur again in the\nRV., nor does it yield a proper meaning. It could only mean, 'give us a horse\nto the chariot, an obtaining prayer, rousing the attention (of the gods) day\nby day.' \xc3\x82pana may mean a drinking or carousing, and I do not see why we\nshould not take it in that sense. Sacrifices in ancient times' were often\nfestivals; VII, 22, 3. ima\xc2\xb4 brahma sadhama\xc2\xb4de _g_ ushasva, 'accept these\nprayers at our feast.' If we suppose that apana refers to the drinking of\nSoma, then\n\np. 304\n\nnothing is more appropriate than to call the drinking _k_ itayat, exciting,\nbrahma, a hymn. Anyhow I can discover no better meaning in this line.\nGrassmann, who knows that _k_ itayati means to excite, yet translates: 'Gebt\nGebet, das durchdringt, euch erinnernd Tag fur Tag.' Ludwig: 'Das erfolgreiche\nbrahma, das erinnernde tag fur tag.' Possibly we should have to change the\naccent from apana to apa\xc2\xb4na. \xc3\x82pana in IX, 10, 5 is equally obscure.\n\nNote 2. On v _ri_ _g_ ana, see I, 165, 153. For fuller discussions of the\nvarious meanings of v _ri_ _g_ ana, see Geldner, Ved. Stud. I, 139; Oldenberg,\nGottinger gel. Anzeigen, 1890, pp. 410 seq.; Ph. Colinet, Les principes de\nl'exegese vedique d'apres MM. Pischel et Geldner, p. 28; Ludwig, \xc3\x9cber Methode\nbei Interpretation des Rig-veda, 1890, pp. 27 seq.\n\nNote 3. Sani means acquiring, success, luck, gain, and is often placed in\njuxtaposition with medha\xc2\xb4, wisdom. If they are thus placed side by side, sank\nlooks almost like an adjective, meaning efficient. RV. I, 18, 6. sanim medha\xc2\xb4m\nayasisham, 'I had asked for efficient, true, real wisdom,' or, 'I had asked\nfor success and wisdom.' In such passages, however, as V, 27, 4. dadat _ri_\n_k_ a\xc2\xb4 sanim yate dadat medha\xc2\xb4m _ri_ tayate, it is clear that sani was\nconsidered as independent and different from medha\xc2\xb4 ( _ri_ _k_ ayate = _ri_\ntayate).\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. On suda\xc2\xb4nava _h_ , see note to I, 64, 6. It must often be left open\nwhether suda\xc2\xb4nu was understood as bounteous, or as having good rain or good\nSoma.\n\nNote 2. Pinvate, lit. to make swell or abound.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. V _ri_ kata\xc2\xb4ti is an old locative of v _ri_ katat, wolf-hood. To place\nus in wolf hood means to treat us as wolves, or as vogelfrei. Others take it\nto mean treating us as a wolf would treat us.\n\nNote 2. Tapusha _k_ akriya. According to Lanman (p. 571) tapusha might be\ntaken as an acc. dual fem. I know,\n\np. 305\n\nhowever, of no strictly analogous cases, and prefer to take tapusha as an\ninstrumental, this being its usual employment.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. The second line is obscure. Neither Grassmann nor Ludwig nor Saya _n_\na can extract any intelligible meaning from it. I have translated it, but I am\nfar from satisfied. There may be an antithesis between the friends (the Maruts\nthemselves, see V, 53, 2), milking the udder of P _ri_ _s_ ni, and the Maruts\ncoming to blame their friends for not offering them sacrifices, or for\noffering them sacrifices in common with Indra. In the first case when they, as\nfriends, milk the cloud, their approach is brilliant and auspicious. In the\nsecond case, when they come to blame those who ought to celebrate them, or\nthose who are actually hostile to them by causing the ruin or decay of a\nfriend of the Maruts, such as Trita, their approach is likewise brilliant, but\nnot auspicious. Trita is a friend of the Maruts whom they assist in battle,\nand it is possible that this legend may be alluded to here. Sometimes Trita\nseems also connected with the third libation which was offered at sunset, just\nas Vish _n_ u represented the second libation which was offered at noon a.\nThus we read, VIII, 12, 16. yat somam indra vish _n_ avi yat va gha trite\naptye yat va marutsu mandase, 'whether you, Indra, enjoy the Soma near Vish\n_n_ u, or near Trita \xc3\x82ptya, or among the Maruts.' _S_ akapu _n_ i, as quoted\nby Yaska (Nir. XII, 19), explains the three steps of Vish _n_ u as earth, sky,\nand heaven; Aur _n_ avabha distinguishes Samaroha _n_ a, Vish _n_ upada, and\nGaya _s_ iras. But all this does not help us to disentangle our verse. It\nshould be added that Bergaigne makes Tritam to be governed by duhu _h_ (Rel.\nVed. II, 327). We should then have to translate, 'or whether they milk Trita\nin order to blame the singer, to make them old who make\n\np. 306\n\nothers old, or who themselves become old.' This, however, does not help us\nmuch. Professor Oldenberg conjectures that possibly _g_ urata\xc2\xb4m might be\nchanged to _g_ urata\xc2\xb4m, and that the dual of the verb might refer to Rudra and\nP _ri_ _s_ ni; or we might read _g_ urata for _g_ urata, if it refers to\nRudriyas. Navamanasya might also be used in the sense of making a noise (see\nI, 29, 5), and possibly navamanasya nide might have been intended for shouting\nand laughing to scorn. But all this leaves the true meaning of the verse as\nunfathomable as ever.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Vish _n_ or eshasya prabh _ri_ the is obscure. At the offering of the\nrapid Vish _n_ u is supposed to mean, when the rapid Vish _n_ u offers Soma.\nThe same phrase occurs again, VII, 40, 5. In VIII, 20, 3, we can translate,\n'we know the strength of the Maruts, and of the hasting Vish _n_ u, the\nbounteous gods.' In VII, 39, 5, the reading is vish _n_ um esham. Bergaigne\n(II, 419) is inclined to take vish _n_ u esha as Soma. We should then\ntranslate, 'at the offering of Soma.'\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. The Da _s_ agvas are mentioned as an old priestly family, like the\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras, and they seem also, like the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, to have their prototypes or\ntheir ancestors among the divine hosts. Could they here be identified with the\nMaruts? They are said to have been the first to carry on the sacrifice, and\nthey are asked to rouse men at the break of the day. Now the same may be said\nof the Maruts. They are often connected with the dawn, probably because the\nstorms break forth with greater vigour in the morning, or, it may be, because\nthe chasing away of the darkness of the night recalls the struggle between the\ndarkness of the thunderstorm and the brightness of the sun. The matutinal\ncharacter of the Maruts appears, for instance, in V, 53, 14 (usri bhesha _g_\nam), and their father Dyaus is likewise called v _ri_ shabha _h_ usriya _h_ ,\nV, 58, 6. In the second line ur _n_ ute, though in the singular, refers also\nto the Maruts in the plural; see Bergaigne, Melanges Renier,\n\np. 307\n\n[paragraph continues] Paris, 1886, p. 80. There still remain two difficult\nwords, mana _h_ and go-ar _n_ asa. The former (see Lanman, p. 501) may be\ntaken as an adjective referring to the Da _s_ agvas or Maruts, unless we take\nit as an adverb, quickly, like makshu. If we could change it into maha\xc2\xb4, it\nwould form an appropriate adjective to _g_ yotisha, as in IV, 50, 4. On go-ar\n_n_ asa all that can be said is that it mostly occurs where something is\nuncovered or revealed, so I, 112, 18; X, 38, 2.\n\nNote 2. On ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am vah, to carry on the sacrifice like a wagon, see\nBergaigne, Rel. Ved. II, 259-260. See also RV. VIII, 26, 15; 58, 1, and ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a-vahas.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. In interpreting this obscure verse we must begin with what is clear.\nThe aru _n_ a\xc2\xb4 _h_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya _h_ are the well-known ornaments of the\nMaruts, mentioned I, 37, 2, note; I, 64, 4, note, &c. The Maruts shine in\nthese ornaments or paints, I, 85, 3; 87, 1; V, 56, 1; X, 78, 7. Though we do\nnot know their special character, we know that, like the daggers, spears, and\nbracelets of the Maruts, they were supposed to contribute to their beautiful\nappearance. Again, we know that when the Maruts are said to grow (vav _ri_ dhu\n_h_ ), that means that they grow in strength, in spirits, and in splendour,\nor, in a physical sense, that the storms increase, that the thunder roars, and\nthe lightnings flash, see V, 55, 3; 59, 5. Now if it is said that the Rudras\ngrew with ksho _n_ is, as if with bright red ornaments, we must have in these\nksho _n_ is the physical prototype of what are metaphorically called their\nglittering ornaments. And here we can only think either of the bright morning\nclouds (referring to usha\xc2\xb4 _h_ na rami\xc2\xb4 _h_ aru _n_ ai _h_ apa ur _n_ ute in\nthe preceding verse), or lightnings. These bright clouds of heaven are\nsometimes conceived as the mothers (III, 9, 2. apa _h_ mat _r i\xc2\xb4_ _h_ ), and\nmore especially the mothers of the Maruts, who are in consequence called\nSindhu-matara _h_ , X, 78, 6, a name elsewhere given to Soma, IX, 61, 7, and\nto the A _s_ vins, I, 46, 2. It is said of a well-known hero, Pururavas\n(originally a solar hero), that as soon as he was born the women (gna _h_ )\nwere there, and immediately afterwards\n\np. 308\n\nthat the rivers increased or cherished him, X, 95, 7. In other passages too\nthese celestial rivers or waters or clouds are represented as women, whether\nmothers or wives (X, 124, 7). A number of names are given to these beings,\nwhen introduced as the companions of the Apsaras Urva _s_ i, and it is said of\nthem that they carne along like a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya _h_ aru _n_ aya _h_ , like\nbright red ornaments, X, 95, 6. It seems clear therefore that the aru _n_ a\xc2\xb4\n_h_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya _h_ of the Maruts have to be explained by the bright red\nclouds of the morning, or in more mythological language, by the Apsaras, who\nare said to be like aru _n_ aya _h_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya _h_. Hence, whatever its\netymology may have been, ksho _n_ i\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ in our passage must refer to the\nclouds of heaven, and the verse can only be translated, 'the Rudras grew with\nthe clouds as with their red ornaments,' that is, the clouds were their red\nornaments, and as the clouds grew in splendour, the Maruts grew with their\nsplendid ornaments.\n\nProfessor Geldner arrived at a similar conclusion. In Bezzenberger's Beitrage,\nXI, p. 327, and more recently in Ved. Stud., p. 277, he assigned to ksho _n_ i\nthe meaning of woman, which is quite possible, and would make it a synonym of\nthe celestial gnas. But he translates, 'the Maruts excite themselves with red\ncolours as with women.' These are hardly Vedic thoughts, and the position of\nna would remain anomalous. Nor should we gain much if we read to ksho _n_ aya\n_h_ aru _n_ ebhi _h_ na a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ibhi _h_ , 'these Rudras were delighted like\nwives by bright ornaments.' The bright ornaments have once for all a settled\nmeaning, they are peculiar to the Maruts, and cannot in a Marut hymn be taken\nin any other sense.\n\nThen comes the question, how is the meaning assigned to ksho _n_ i, namely\ncloud, or, as personified, Apsaras, applicable to other passages? In X, 95, 9,\nit seems most appropriate: 'So long as the mortal (Pururavas), longing for the\nimmortal (Apsaras), does not come near with strength to those ksho _n_ is, i.\ne. those Apsaras, or morning clouds, they beautified their bodies like ducks'\n(an excellent image, if one watches ducks cleaning themselves in the water),\n'like sporting horses biting each other.' Geldner\n\np. 309\n\ntranslates this verse somewhat differently, Ved. Stud. I, p. 276.\n\nHaving disposed of these two passages where ksho _n_ i occurs in the plural,\nwe have next to consider those where it stands in the dual. Here ksho _n_ i\nalways means heaven and earth, like rodasi, dyavap _ri_ thivi, &c.\n\nVIII, 7, 22. sam u tye mahati\xc2\xb4 _h_ apa _h_ sam ksho _n_ i\xc2\xb4 sam u su\xc2\xb4ryam \xe2\x80\xa6\nparva _s_ a _h_ dadhu _h_. They, the Maruts, set the great waters (the sky),\nheaven and earth and the sun piecemeal (or, they put them together piece by\npiece).\n\nVIII, 52, 10. sam indra _h_ ra\xc2\xb4ya _h_ b _ri_ hati\xc2\xb4 _h_ adhunuta sam ksho _n_\ni\xc2\xb4 sam u su\xc2\xb4ryam. Indra shook the great treasures, heaven and earth, and the\nsun.\n\nVIII, 99, 6. anu te _s_ ushmam turayantam iyatu _h_ ksho _n_ i\xc2\xb4 _s_ i _s_ um\nna matara. Heaven and earth followed thy rapid strength, like mother-cows\ntheir calf.\n\nII, 16, 3. na ksho _n_ i\xc2\xb4bhyam paribhve\xcc\x83 te indriyam. Thy strength is not to\nbe compassed by heaven and earth.\n\nIf after this we look at the passage translated by Professor Geldner, I, 180,\n5. apa _h_ ksho _n_ i\xc2\xb4 sa _k_ ate ma\xc2\xb4hina vam, we see at once that apa _h_ and\nksho _n_ i\xc2\xb4 cannot be separated, and that we must translate, your Mahina\nreaches heaven and earth and the sky. Mahina, according to Professor Geldner,\nmeans the magnificent woman, namely Surya, but it is possible that it may have\nbeen meant for 'mahima, your greatness reaches heaven and earth and the sky.'\nApa _h_ , which Professor Geldner translates 'from the water,' is the acc.\nplural, meaning the waters between heaven and earth, or the sky. It occurs\nagain in connection with heaven and earth, the sun, heaven, and generally\nwithout any copula. Thus, VIII, 7, 22. apa _h_ , ksho _n_ i\xc2\xb4, su\xc2\xb4ryam, i. e.\nthe waters (the sky), heaven and earth, the sun. I, 36, 8. rodasi apa _h_ ,\nheaven and earth and the waters; cf. V, 31, 6. Likewise I, 52, 12. apa _h_\nsva\xcc\x83 _h_ paribhu\xc2\xb4 _h_ eshi a\xc2\xb4 divam; V, 14, 4. avindat ga\xc2\xb4 _h_ apa _h_ sva\xcc\x83\n_h_ ; VI, 47, 14. apa _h_ ga\xc2\xb4 _h_ ; cf. VI, 60, 2. VII, 44, 1. dya\xc2\xb4vap _ri_\nthivi\xc2\xb4 apa _h_ sva\xcc\x83 _h_ , cf. X, 36, 1; IX. 90, 4; 91, 6.\n\nThere remain five passages where ksho _n_ i _h_ occurs, and where Professor\nGeldner's conjecture that it means women\n\np. 310\n\nholds good. In I, 54, 1, it may mean real women, or the women of the clouds.\nIn I, 57, 4; 173, 7; VIII, 3, 10; 13, 17; also in X, 22, 9, women seems the\nmost plausible translation.\n\nNote 2. _R_ itasya sadanani is almost impossible to translate. It may be the\nplaces in heaven where the Maruts are supposed to be, or the places where\nsacrifices are offered to them.\n\nNote 3. \xc3\x81tyena pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ asa has been explained in different ways. Saya _n_ a\nrenders it by always moving power; Grassmann by 'mit schnell erregtem\nSchimmer;' Ludwig, 'mit eilender kraft,' though he is no longer satisfied with\nthis meaning, and suggests 'net for catching.' Roth has touched several times\non this word. In the Allgemeine Monatsschrift of 1851, p. 87, he suggested for\npa\xc2\xb4 _g_ as the meaning of 'impression of a foot or of a carriage, perhaps also\nreflection.' In his Notes on the Nirukta, p. 78 seq., he is very hard on the\nIndian commentators who explain the word by strength, but who never go\nconscientiously through all the passages in which a word occurs. He then still\nmaintained that the word ought to be translated by track.\n\nIt seems, however, that the most appropriate meaning in the passages in which\npa\xc2\xb4 _g_ as occurs is splendour, though of course a stream of light may be\nconceived as a bright train or path. In some the meaning of light seems quite\ninevitable, for instance, III, 15, I. vi pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ asa p _ri_ thuna _s_ o _s_\nukana _h_. Agni, shining with broad light.\n\nVIII, 46, 25. a\xc2\xb4 \xe2\x80\xa6 yahi makha\xc2\xb4ya pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ ase. Come hither, Vayu, for strong\nlight.\n\nIII, 14, 1. (agni _h_ ) p _ri_ thivya\xc2\xb4m pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ a _h_ a _s_ ret. Agni assumed\n(or spread) splendour on earth.\n\nVII, 10, 1. usha _h_ na _g_ ara _h_ p _ri_ thu pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ a _h_ a _s_ ret.\n(Agni,) like the lover of the dawn, assumed (or spread) wide splendour.\n\nIII, 61, 5. urdhvam madhudha\xc2\xb4 divi pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ a _h_ a _s_ ret. The dawn assumed\nrising splendour in the sky.\n\nVII, 3, 4. vi yasya te p _ri_ thivya\xc2\xb4m pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ a _h_ a _s_ ret. Thou (Agni)\nwhose splendour spread on earth.\n\np. 311\n\nIX, 68, 3. abhivra _g_ an akshitam pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ a _h_ a\xc2\xb4 dade. (Soma) approaching\nassumed imperishable splendour. This splendour of Soma is also mentioned in\nIX, 109, 21, and the expression that he shakes his splendour (v _r i_tha kar)\noccurs IX, 76, 1; 88, 5. (Cf. Geldner, Ved. Stud. I, p. 117.)\n\nIn VI, 21, 7. abhi tva pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ a _h_ rakshasa _h_ vi tasthe, it would, no\ndoubt, seem preferable to translate, 'the power of the Rakshas came upon\nthee,' but the ugram pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ a _h_ , the fierce light, is not out of place\neither, while in most of the passages which we have examined, the meaning of\npower would be entirely out of place.\n\nIn I, 121, 11, heaven and earth seem to be called pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ asi, the two\nsplendours. Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 87, translates atyena pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ asa by 'durch\ndas stattliche Ross,' namely the Soma, but pa\xc2\xb4 _g_ as seems to be something\nthat belongs to Soma, not Soma himself.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. Grassmann suggests iyana\xc2\xb4 _h_ instead of iyana _h_.\n\nNote 2. Abhish _t_ aye, for superiority or victory, rather than for\nassistance. Abhish _t_ i, with accent on the last syllable, means conqueror or\nvictorious; see RV. I, 9, 1; III, 34, 4; X, 100, 12; 104, 10.\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1.
