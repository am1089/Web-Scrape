Setting apart a thousand cows, he said, 'He who\nis the most learned in sacred writ amongst you, O Brahma _n_ as, shall drive\naway these (cows) 1!'\n\n11:6:3:22\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya then said, 'This way (drive) them!' They said,\n'Art thou really the most learned in sacred writ amongst us, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya?' He replied, 'Reverence be to him who is most learned in sacred writ!\nWe are but hankering after cows 2!'\n\n11:6:3:33\\. They then said (to one another), 'Which of us shall question him?'\nThe shrewd _S_ akalya said, 'I!' When he (Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya) saw him, he\nsaid, 'Have the Brahma _n_ as made of thee a thing for quenching the\nfirebrand, _S_ akalya?'\n\n11:6:3:44\\. He said 3, 'How many gods are there, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya?'--'Three\nhundred and three, and three thousand and three,' he replied.--'Yea, so it\nis!' he said. 'How many gods are there really, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya?'--'Thirty-\nthree.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said.\n\np. 116\n\n[paragraph continues] 'How many gods are there really, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya?'--'Three.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'How many gods are there\nreally, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya?'--'Two.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'How many gods\nare there really, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya?'--'One and a half.'--'Yea, so it is!' he\nsaid. 'How many gods are there really, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya?'--'One.'--'Yea, so\nit is!' he said. 'Who are those three hundred and three, and three thousand\nand three?'\n\n11:6:3:55\\. He replied, 'These are their powers, but thirty-three gods indeed\nthere are.'--'Who are those thirty-three? Eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and\ntwelve \xc3\x82dityas,--that makes thirty-one; and Indra and Pra _g_ apati make up\nthe thirty-three.'\n\n11:6:3:66\\. 'Who are the Vasus?'--'Agni, the Earth, Vayu (the wind), the Air,\n\xc3\x82ditya (the sun), Heaven, the Moon, and the Stars:--these are the Vasus, for\nthese cause all this (universe) to abide (vas), and hence they are the Vasus.'\n\n11:6:3:77\\. 'Who are the Rudras?'--'These ten vital airs in man, and the self\n(spirit) is the eleventh: when these depart from this mortal body, they cause\nwailing (rud), and hence they are the Rudras.'\n\n11:6:3:88\\. 'Who are the \xc3\x82dityas?'--'The twelve months of the year: these are\nthe \xc3\x82dityas, for they pass whilst laying hold on everything here; and inasmuch\nas they pass whilst laying hold (a-da) on everything here, they are the\n\xc3\x82dityas.'\n\n11:6:3:99\\. 'Who is Indra, and who Pra _g_ apati?'--'Indra, indeed, is thunder\n1, and Pra _g_ apati the sacrifice.'--'What is thunder?'--'The\nthunderbolt.'--'What is the sacrifice?'--'Cattle.'\n\np. 117\n\n11:6:3:1010\\. 'Who are those three gods?'--'These three worlds, for therein\nall the gods are contained.'--'Who are those two gods?'--'Food and breath.\n(life).'--'Who is the one and a half?'--'He who is blowing here 1 (Vayu, the\nwind).'--'Who is the one god?'--'Breath.'\n\n11:6:3:1111\\. He (Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya) said, 'Thou hast gone on questioning me\nbeyond the deity 2, beyond which there must be no questioning: thou shalt die\nere such and such a day, and not even thy bones shall reach thy home!' And so,\nindeed, did he ( _S_ akalya) die; and robbers carried off his bones 3, taking\nthem for something else 4. Wherefore let no man decry 5 any one, for even (by)\nknowing this, he gets the better of him 6.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[115:1](sbe44036.htm#fr_355) One might also construe,--These are yours, O\nBrahma _n_ as: he who is the most learned in sacred writ shall drive (them)\naway. Cf. Delbruck, Altind. Syntax, pp. 251, 363.\n\n[115:2](sbe44036.htm#fr_356) Gokama eva kevala _m_ vaya _m_ sma _h_ bhavama\n_h_ , Say.\n\n[115:3](sbe44036.htm#fr_357) See XIV, 6, 9, 1 seqq (There is no such location\n--JBH).\n\n[116:1](sbe44036.htm#fr_358) Saya _n_ a takes 'stanayitnu' in the sense of\n'thunder-cloud,'--stanayitnu _h_ stanana _s_ ilo gar _g_ an par _g_ anya ity\nartha _h_.\n\n[117:1](sbe44036.htm#fr_359) XIV, 6, 9, 10, the use of 'adhyardha (having one\nhalf over)' in connection with the wind is accounted for by a fanciful\netymology, viz. because the wind succeeds (or prevails) over (adhy-ardh)\neverything here.\n\n[117:2](sbe44036.htm#fr_360) That is, as would seem, Pra _g_ apati, cf. XIV,\n6, 6, 1 (There is no such location--JBH), where Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya tells Gargi\nhow one world is 'woven and rewoven' on another, the last being that of Pra\n_g_ apati, which was woven on that of the Brahman; and when Gargi asks him as\nto what world the Brahman-world was woven on, he gives the same reply as here,\nviz. that there must be no questioning beyond that deity (Pra _g_ apati).\n\n[117:3](sbe44036.htm#fr_361) Prof. Weber, Ind. Streifen, I, p. 23, connects\nthis feature with the belief in a strictly personal existence after death\nprevailing at the time of the Brahma _n_ a, which involved, as a matter of\ngreat moment, the careful collection of the bones after the corpse had been\nburnt, with a view to their being placed in an earthen vessel and buried.--Cf.\n\xc3\x82 _s_ val. G _ri_ hyas. IV, 5, 1 seqq.; Katy. _S_ r. XXI, 3, 7 seqq. See also\nJ. Muir, Orig. Sanskrit Texts, vol. v, p. 316.\n\n[117:4](sbe44036.htm#fr_362) That is, mistaking them for gold or some other\nvaluable substance, comm.,--anyan manyamana _h_ suvar _n_ adidravyatvena _g_\nananta _h_.\n\n[117:5](sbe44036.htm#fr_363) Or, 'revile,' as the St. Petersb. Dict. takes it.\nPossibly, however, 'upa-vad' has here the sense of 'to speak to,' i.e. 'to\nquestion or lecture some one.'\n\n[117:6](sbe44036.htm#fr_364) The commentary is partly corrupt and not very\nintelligible:--p. 118 Yasmad eva _m_ tasmad iti goshu katharupe _n_ a\ntattvanik _ri_ (ti)m upetya vadi na bhavet, sva (? svayam) api tu eva _m_ vit\nparo bhavati, uktaprakare _n_ a ya _h_ pra _n_ asvarupa _m_ _g_ anati ta _m_\nvidva _m_ sam upetya tatparye _n_ a sava (? atmana) yukto bhaved ity artha _h_\n, Say. Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. V, p. 36.1, note.--Prof. Delbruck, Altind.\nSyntax, p. 528, takes 'paro bhavati' in the sense of 'he becomes one of the\nother side, or shore,' i.e. he dies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 7, 1.
