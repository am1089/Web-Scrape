Vyasa said :-- The Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u spoke again unto Prajapati :--\nBrahma _n_! All these beings fascinated by Maya, cannot know the Real Essence,\nthe Highest Truth.\n\n\n\n2\\. We, too, are fascinated by that Maya; and hence we also, being blinded by\nthat, do not at all remember That Highest Eternal Puru _s_ a, calm and quiet,\nthe World Teacher, the Highest Self, of the nature of Pure Existence,\nIntelligence and Bliss.\n\n\n\n3\\. O Brahma! I am Vi _sn_ u, I am Brahma, I am Rudra, thus our I-ness\nahamkara has blinded our eyesight; and we are made unable to recognise That\nEternal Highest Self.\n\n\n\n4\\. As the wooden dolls dance according to the will of the player, the\nmagician, I also am similarly fascinated by the Maya and am thus incessantly\nrolling about like a dependent man.\n\n\n\n5-6. O Brahma :-- In the beginning of the Kalpa, Mahes\xc2\x92vara, You and I saw the\nwonderful unspeakable form and glory of that Highest Self at the time of\nRasamandala in the Mani Dvipa where there was the Mandara Tree and the Devas\nassembled. Then I also saw that wonderful thing a second time in the\nSudharnava ocean of nectar, and the most wonderful of it is this, that until\nwe were able to See that Form, we did not hear anything of Her before!\n\n\n\n7\\. Therefore, O Devas! Today do you all remember that Prime Force, the\nHighest Self, that all beneficent Force that yields all good and auspicious\nthings; That Very Force will fulfill now all your desires.\n\n\n\n8\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! No sooner the Bhagavan Hari addressed thus, Brahma\nand the other Devas at once mentally began to meditate on that Eternal Yoga\nMaya, the Goddess of the Universe.\n\n\n\n9\\. Being thus meditated, at once appeared before their eyesight the Devi, the\nGoddess of the Universe, whose colours were like the blood red Java flower,\nholding in two of Her hands noose, hook, or goad, while the third hand\nindicated favour and the fourth hand bade all discard every sort of fear.\n\n\n\n10\\. As the web comes out of a spider and sparks come out of fire, so this\nwhole Universe comes out of that Goddess. We all bow down before Her with our\nhumble hearts, full of devotion.\n\n\n\n11\\. We all salute to that Goddess of the Universe, Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, under Whose\nMayic force this whole Universe, moving and unmoving, is created; Who is All-\nIntelligence and the Ocean of Mercy.\n\n\n\np. 320\n\n\n\n12\\. This world appears real to him who is unable to realise Her Real Essence;\nand the world drops off as unreal no sooner he realises Her Presence. We all\nmeditate on that All Intelligent Goddess and we all pray to Her that She may\ngrant unto us more strength to meditate Her and Her alone so.\n\n\n\n13\\. We all want to know Maha Lak _s_ mi, we all meditate on the Omnipotent;\nMay the Goddess grant unto us strength to meditate on Her so.\n\n\n\n14\\. O Thou, the Remover of the world\xc2\x92s afflictions! Best Thou pleased unto\nus; O Thou, kind hearted! Do this work for us and promote our good. O Thou,\nLord of the Earth! Dost Thou relieve the burden of the earth by killing these\nAsuras and bring on our welfare.\n\n\n\n15\\. O Thou, Lotus-Eyed! If Thou dost not show Thy mercy towards the gods,\nthey will never be able to strike their enemies with their weapons in the\nbattlefield. O Goddess! Thou didst verify the truth of this before, when Thou\ndidst assume the appearance of a Yak _s_ a and utter the following sentences\n\xc2\x93O Fire! You burn this blade of grass,\xc2\x94 etc. (in the Kena Talavakara Upani _s_\nada.)\n\n\n\n16\\. O Mother! Kamsa, Bhauma, Kalayavana, Kes\xc2\x92i, Jarasandha, the son of\nBrihadratha, Vaka, Putana, Khara, S\xc2\x92alva and other vicious kings respectively\nare dwelling on the earth. Dost Thou better kill them and relieve the burden\nof the Earth.\n\n\n\n17\\. O Lotus-Eyed! Thou hadst killed those Asuras without any effort that were\nnot slain by Vi _sn_ u or Mahes\xc2\x92vara and they ended their lives, while they\nwere beholding Thy pleasing countenance.\n\n\n\n18\\. O Goddess! Holding Moon on Her forehead! These Hari, Hara, Brahma and the\nother gods are unable to move a step without the help of Force; nothing to\nspeak any further, the thousand headed King of Serpents is unable to hold this\nearth even for a moment, were he not provided with the S\xc2\x92akti of upholding\nthis world.\n\n\n\n19\\. Indra said :-- O Bhagavati! Would Brahma be ever able to create this\nworld without the aid of Sarasvati! Would Vi _sn_ u, the Deva of the Devas, be\never able to preserve it without the aid of Lak _s_ mi or would Mahes\xc2\x92vara be\never able, to destroy this world without the help of His Uma; no, never! These\nDevas, the Trinity, are able to take their respective parts in the keeping up\nof the world simply because they are united with the forces, incarnate in\nSarasvati, etc., who are again parts of Thee.\n\n\n\np. 321\n\n\n\n20\\. Vi _sn_ u said :-- O Vimale! Were we deprived of Thy Force, the Creator\nwould never have been able to create the world, I would never have been able\nto preserve it and Mahes\xc2\x92vara would never have been able to destroy. Therefore\nO Devi! Thou alone art reigning as the Supreme Goddess amidst all the glories\nin the creation, preservation, and destruction of this Universe.\n\n\n\n21-22. Vyasa said :-- O king! Thus praised by the Gods, the Goddess then\naddressed them :-- O Devas! Let all anxieties leave you all; I will do what\nthe Devas have desired, even if it be very difficult to do in this world; now\nexplain what is troubling the Goddess Earth.\n\n\n\n23\\. The Devas replied :-- The wicked kings are troubling very much this\nEarth. She cannot any longer bear their burden; therefore She came crying unto\nus.\n\n\n\n24\\. O Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari! Now it is Your duty to remove this load of earth. O\nAuspicious One! Know this, the desire of the gods.\n\n\n\n25-28. O Mother! In days of yore, You have killed the most powerful Danava\nnamed Mahi _s_ a, attended by lakhs and lakhs of Danavas and Daityas; What to\nspeak! You have slain S\xc2\x92umbha, Nis\xc2\x92umbha, Raktavija, the very powerful Cha\n_nd_ a Mun _d_ a, Dhumralochana, Durmukha, Duhsana, the strong Karala and many\nother cruel Danavas.\n\n\n\nNow, similarly kill the wicked kings, the enemies of the Gods and save the\nEarth from their heavy loads.\n\n\n\n29\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus addressed by the Devas, the Most Auspicious One, the\nDevi, whose colour was black and who looked askance, said smiling in a tone,\ngrave and deep, like that of the rumbling of a raincloud.\n\n\n\n30\\. O Suras! I have already thought over how the burden of those wicked\nkings, the parts incarnate of Asuras, can be removed.\n\n\n\n31\\. I will, by My own power, rob them of their powers, of that highly\nprosperous and affluent Jarasandha, the king of Magadha, and others, the parts\nincarnate of the wicked Asuras, that are now shining on the Earth.\n\n\n\n32\\. O Devas! You would all better go down and incarnate yourselves as part\nincarnations, impregnated with My power, and help thus in the removal of the\nload of this earth.\n\n\n\n33\\. The Deva Prajapati Mahar _s_ i Kas\xc2\x92yapa would first of all go with his\nhis wife and incarnate as \xc3\x82naka Dundubhi Vasudeva, in the race of Yadu.\n\n\n\np. 322\n\n\n\n34\\. The Imperishable Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u will also incarnate as part, owing to\nthe curse of Bhrigu, as the son of Vasudeva.\n\n\n\n35\\. O Devas! I will be born, then, in the womb of Yas\xc2\x92oda, in Gokula and will\naccomplish all the ends of the Gods.\n\n\n\n36\\. I will send Vi _sn_ u from the prison to the Gokula; also I will transfer\nAnanta Deva from the womb of Devaki to the womb of Rohi _n_ i.\n\n\n\n37\\. They two will grow, day by day, by My Force and at the end of the Dvapara\nYuga, will no doubt kill the wicked kings.\n\n\n\n38-39. Arju _n_ a too, the part incarnate of Indra, will destroy the armies of\nthose kings. Yudhi _st_ hira, the part incarnate of Dharma, Bhimsena, that of\nof Vayu, Nakula and Sahadeva the incarnate of the two A\xc2\x92svins, and Bhisma, the\nincarnate of Vasu as the son of the Ganga, will take their respective births\nand exhaust their armies.\n\n\n\n40\\. O Devas! Now be calm and quiet and go. Let the Earth be also calm and\nquiet; be confident that I will certainly remove the load of this earth.\n\n\n\n41\\. I will make the above mentioned Gods as my instruments merely and I will\ndestroy, by My own force, the K _s_ atriyas in the battlefield of Kuruk _s_\nettra.\n\n\n\n42\\. Malice, jealousy, foul intention, desire, attachment, vanity,\ncovetousness, desire for victory, lust, and fascination are the vices that\nwill destroy the Yadavas.\n\n\n\n43\\. The race of Yadu will end owing to the curse of a Brahma _n_ a. The\nBhagavan also will leave His mortal coil due to a curse.\n\n\n\n44\\. Now go and incarnate in your respective parts, with your wives, in Gokula\nand Mathura, and be helpers in the work of the Lord.\n\n\n\n45-46. Vyasa said :-- Saying thus, the Devi the Goddess of the Universe, the\nMaya Incarnate of the Highest Self disappeared. The Devas and the Earth went\nto their respective places. O king Janamejaya! the Goddess Earth was pleased\nwith the Devi\xc2\x92s words, and being quiet, remained surrounded with various\nmedicinal plants and creepers.\n\n\n\n47\\. Then the subjects felt peace and pleasure, the Brahma _n_ s also grew\nstronger in happiness and prosperity, and the Munis became glad and began to\nperform their religious acts with fresh zeal and alacrity.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Nineteenth Chapter in the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses, the Maha Pura _n_ am, on chanting the hymns to\nthe Devi by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 20](bk04ch20.htm)\n\n'
