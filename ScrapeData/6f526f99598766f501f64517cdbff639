At a _K_ aitya sacrifice he should before the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t\n(offering) offer a Bali to the _K_ aitya.\n\n2 2. If, however, (the _K_ aitya) is distant, (he should send his Bali)\nthrough a leaf-messenger.\n\np. 179\n\n3 3. With the _Ri_ _k_ , \'Where thou knowest, O tree\' (Rig-veda V, 5, 10), let\nhim make two lumps (of food), put them on a carrying-pole, hand them over to\nthe messenger, and say to him, \'Carry this Bali to that ( _K_ aitya).\'\n\n4\\. (He gives him the lump) which is destined for the messenger, with (the\nwords), \'This to thee.\'\n\n5\\. If there is anything dangerous between (them and the _K_ aitya), (he gives\nhim) some weapon also.\n\n6 6. If a navigable river is between (them and the _K_ aitya, he gives him)\nalso something like a raft with (the words), \'Hereby thou shalt cross.\'\n\n7 7. At the Dhanvantari sacrifice let him offer first a Bali to the Purohita,\nbetween the Brahman and the fire.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[178:1](sbe29111.htm#fr_431) 12, 1. There seems to be no doubt that Professor\nStenzler is right in giving to _k_ aitya in this chapter its ordinary meaning\nof religious shrine (\'Denkmal\'). The text shows that the Kaitya sacrifice was\nnot offered like other sacrifices at the sacrificer\'s home, but that in some\ncases the offering would have to be sent, at least symbolically, to distant\nplaces. This confirms Professor Stenzler\'s translation of _k_ aitya. Naraya\n_n_ a explains _k_ aitya by _k_ itte bhava, and says, \'If he makes a vow to a\ncertain deity, saying, "If I obtain such and such a desire, I shall offer to\nthee an \xc3\x82 _g_ ya sacrifice, or a Sthalipaka, or an animal"\xc2\x97and if he then\nobtains what he had wished for and \'performs that sacrifice to that deity:\nthis is a _k_ aitya sacrifice.\' I do not know anything that supports this\nstatement as to the meaning of _k_ aitya.\n\n[178:2](sbe29111.htm#fr_432) \'He should make of a leaf a messenger and a\ncarrying-pole.\' Naraya _n_ a.\n\nIt is not clear whether besides this image of a messenger there was also a\nreal messenger who had to carry the Bali to the _K_ aitya, p. 179 or whether\nthe whole rite was purely symbolical, and based on the principle: In sacris\nficta pro veris accipiuntur.\n\n[179:3](sbe29111.htm#fr_433) Comp.
