Should it be said that inference is to be carried on in a different way;\n(we reply that) thus also it follows that (the objection raised) is not got\nrid of.\n\nLet us then view the matter as follows. The arguments actually set forth by\nBuddha and others may have to be considered as invalid, but all the same we\nmay arrive at the Pradhana theory through other lines of reasoning by which\n\np. 426\n\nthe objections raised against the theory are refuted.--But, we reply, this\nalso is of no avail. A theory which rests exclusively on arguments derived\nfrom human reason may, at some other time or place, be disestablished by\narguments devised by people more skilful than you in reasoning; and thus there\nis no getting over the objection founded on the invalidity of all mere\nargumentation. The conclusion from all this is that, with regard to\nsupersensuous matters, Scripture alone is authoritative, and that reasoning is\nto be applied only to the support of Scripture. In agreement herewith Manu\nsays, 'He who supports the teaching of the _Ri_ shis and the doctrine as to\nsacred duty with arguments not conflicting with the Veda, he alone truly knows\nsacred duty' (Manu XII, 106). The teaching of the Sa _n_ khyas which conflicts\nwith the Veda cannot therefore be used for the purpose of confirming and\nelucidating the meaning of the Veda.--Here finishes the section treating of\n'difference of nature.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13.
