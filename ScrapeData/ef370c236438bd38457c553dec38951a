(The other stage of life) is to be accomplished, (according to) Badaraya\n_n_ a; on account of the scriptural statement of equality.\n\nThe teacher Badaraya _n_ a is of opinion that that other stage of life is\nsomething to be accomplished. The view that there is a contradiction because\nthe other stage of life is stated in the Veda and, on the other hand, works\nsuch as the Agnihotra must necessarily be performed, and that, in order to\nremove this contradiction, that other stage of life must be entered upon by\nthose only who are not qualified for active worship, he rejects; being of\nopinion that that other stage is to be entered upon, in the same way as the\nstate of the householder, even by him who does not wish to do so.--On what\nground?--'On account of the scriptural statement of equality.' For we have a\npassage (viz. 'There are three branches of the law,' &c.) which refers equally\nto that other stage as to the state of the householder. As the state of the\nhouseholder which\n\np. 298\n\nis enjoined in other passages only is here referred to, so also that other\nstage of life. The case is analogous to the reference made to the wearing of\nthe sacrificial thread round the neck or on the right shoulder--which two\nmodes are established in other scriptural passages--in a passage the purpose\nof which it is to enjoin the wearing of the thread on the left shoulder. The\nother stage must therefore be entered upon in the same way as the state of the\nhouseholder.--Analogously in the passage, 'Wishing for that world only\nmendicants leave their homes,' the last stage of life is mentioned together\nwith the study of the Veda, sacrifice and so on, and in the passage, 'Those\nwho in the forest,' &c., with the knowledge of the five fires.--The remark,\nmade above by the purvapakshin, that in such passages as 'austerity is the\nsecond' there is unambiguous reference to a further stage of life, is without\nforce, since there is a reason enabling us to determine what is meant. The\ntext proclaims in the beginning that there are three subdivisions ('There are\nthree branches of the law'). Now the sacrifice and the other duties (which the\ntext enumerates subsequently to the introductory clause) can, because they are\nmore than three, and rest on separate originative injunctions, be comprised\nwithin the three branches only if they are connected with one of the stages of\nlife. Now the terms 'sacrifice' and so on indicate that the stage of\nhouseholdership constitutes one branch of the law, and the term 'Brahma _k_\narin' clearly denotes another stage; what then remains but to assume that the\nterm 'austerity' also denotes a stage of life, viz. the one in which austerity\nis the chief thing? Analogously the reference to the forest--in the passage,\n'Those who in the forest,'--indicates that by the austerity and faith\nmentioned there we have to understand that stage of life in which austerity\nand faith are the chief thing.--From all this it follows that the further\nstage of life has to be gone through, even if the passage under discussion\nshould do nothing but refer to it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 20](sbe38229.htm)\n\n"
