It is\nclear, for instance, that if we address a little girl of three as _Ma_ , or a\nboy of the same age as _Bap_ , that delicate mingling of gravity and laughter\nwhich we intend to convey is a matter entirely of the colour of the voice, and\nwill defy any attempt to render it in a foreign tongue. One of the most\nstriking words of this class is _Gopala_. Literally, it means the Cowherd,\nreferring to Krishna--the Krishna of Brindaban. But it has been so\nappropriated in this regard that its actual significance can only be rendered\nin English as "Christ-Child," and the woman who folds her baby-boy closer,\ncalling him Gopala, is paralleled amongst English mothers only by one who\nthinks of her child as the Christ-Child, come to her out of night and storm\nseeking to find His Own. In this sense the name is often on the lips of all\nour household. For in one of the rooms of our zenana lives an old\n\np. 125\n\nold woman, who is known as _Gopaler-Ma_ , the Christ-Child\'s Mother.\n\n.         .         .         .         .         .         .         .\n\nAll night long we had been watching the slow hard breathing of the dying. In,\nin, in, it would go, growing ever more and more still, till one thought that\nnever again could any movement occur in the aged frame, and then freedom once\nmore and a succession of quick deep inbreathings. Such breathing, they said,\nwas seen but seldom, and was the result of long years of _Pranayama_ ,\npractised unconsciously over the beads, as night and day the old woman had\ncounted them, saying the name of her _Ishtam_ , "Gopala, Gopala, Gopala!"\n\nFor she beside whom we sat and watched was Gopaler-Ma, that saint whom Sri\nRamakrishna himself had treated as his mother.\n\nWithout a single want she lay there, as she had lived, the mind suspended in\nthe thought that had made its life, the face full of the last sweetness and\npeace. A day and a night already had she lain thus by the Ganges side. For at\nthe moment of the rising of the full moon, we had stepped with her over the\nthreshold of the door, and had felt the silent soaring of her spirit, as it\ncast off triumphantly the first of its outer wrappings, the shell of home. But\nwhen she had reached the _gh ats_, and lain awhile in the play of cool breezes\nand the brightness of the moon, she had shown, as\n\np. 126\n\nthe dying are wont to do, some signs of revival. And the candle of life for\nmany an hour thereafter had burnt up in its worn socket, before it was finally\nto be put out.\n\nIt was not, perhaps, entire unconsciousness in which she lay. For to one and\nanother it would seem, now and again, as if she gave a look of recognition,\nfollowing them with her eyes. And on that last morning, when a Brahmin came\nand chanted above her _slokas_ from the Upanishads, she had responded visibly,\nwith what would almost represent excitement. All her life long she had\nworshipped the idea of the Holy Child, and now there seemed a fitness in the\nfact that at the last, dying of old age at over ninety years, the worn-out\nframe had gone back to babyhood again, and the twitching of the limbs or the\nturning of the head was the only sign of volition she could give.\n\nBut even this had been sometime past, for now that night was with us once\nagain, she had lain still for many hours, with all the consciousness turned\ninward, and the peace of one who asked nothing of the world about her.\n\nWe, the waiting women, could hear from without the long low lapping of the\nGanges against the foot of the bathing-stairs, and the moaning whisper of the\nrain-winds as now and again they swept down and caught the surface of the\nwaters. And once, was it at midnight, or was it an hour or so\n\np. 127\n\nlater?--once in the midst of the silence there came a rushing and swirling of\nthe river beneath the cloud-veiled moon, and the little boats lying at anchor\non the Ganges knocked against each other, and the word went round, "The tide\nis coming in!" But some, to whom the passing soul had been friend and _Guru_ ,\nsighed, for with the turn of that tide had we not been warned that she would\ngo forth, and her place and people know her no more?\n\nHour upon hour had gone and still no change. Some who had rested rose, and\nplied little offices of tenderness beside the sick, and another lay down to\nsnatch a spell of sleep. Suddenly there was a stir, and a light hand touched\nthe sleeper. "Call the bearers," said one, "for the end is come!" Out on the\nterrace above the river-steps they sat, as they had sat all night, holding\ndeep talk of the past, and of the Lives with which this life outgoing here had\nbeen a link, and easy enough were they to call. A moment more and the dying\nform was lifted to the cot, and then, on the shoulders of yellow and white\nclad bearers together, it was borne swiftly out of the room to the north, and\nthen down the few steps that it needed to take Gopaler-Ma where she could lie\nwith feet touching the sacred waters, and so go forth.\n\nThere she lay, the last changed breaths coming at easy intervals, while one of\nthe monks, whom\n\np. 128\n\nshe had known as boys, bent over her and with his brow to hers, half spoke,\nhalf whispered the words that the Hindu loves to hear in his last hour-- _Om\nGanga Narayana! Om Ganga Narayana Brahma!_ A moment more, and then with one\nvoice from the circle of watchers came the [shout of](errata.htm#3) _Haribol!_\nfor the last breath had gone. The spirit of Gopaler-Ma had taken flight, and\nonly the garment of flesh was left behind.\n\nThen one at the head of the bier, looking up at the brightening of the sky\nbehind the clouds asked, "Is this the dawn?" And from the foot came back the\nanswer, "Yes it is the dawn!" And then, looking down, we saw that the waters\nthat had bathed the feet of the dying were already receding--were already\nsunken some inches below us. Gopaler-Ma had died indeed at the moment of dawn,\non the very turn of the outgoing tide.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Indian Ash, or Tree of Healing](seh23.htm)\n\n'
