The spade is still in his hand, when he addresses the beasts. For\nwhen the gods at that time were about to search (for Agni) in these (animals)\nthey placed their vigour in front; and in like manner does\n\np. 204\n\nthis one, now that he is about to search in these (animals), place his vigour\nin front.\n\n6:3:2:22\\. He addresses the horse, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 12), 'Most speedily 1,\nO courser, run hither,'--what is swift, that is speedy, and what is swifter\nthan swift, that is most speedy;--'along the widest range,'--the widest range\ndoubtless is this (earth): thus, 'along this wide range;'--'in the sky is thy\nhighest home, in the air thy navel, upon earth thy womb:' he thus makes it to\nbe those deities, Agni, Vayu, and \xc3\x82ditya (the sun), and thus lays vigour into\nthe horse.\n\n6:3:2:33\\. Then the ass, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 13), 'Yoke ye two the ass,' he\nsays this to the Adhvaryu and the Sacrificer;--'upon this course, ye showerers\nof wealth!'--that is, 'upon this performance, ye showerers of wealth;'--'him,\nbearing Agni, and helpful 2 unto us;'--that is, 'him, bearing Agni, and urged\nforward by us:' he thereby lays vigour into the ass.\n\n6:3:2:44\\. Then the he-goat, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 14), 'At every yoking, at\nevery race, we call him, the most powerful,'--race 3 means food: thus, 'in\nevery performance, in respect of every food we call him, the most\npowerful;'--'Indra to our help, we his friends!'--that is, 'him, the strong\n(indriyavat), to our help:' he thereby lays vigour into the he-goat.\n\n6:3:2:55\\. With three (formulas) he addresses (the victims),--threefold is\nAgni: as great as Agni is, as\n\np. 205\n\ngreat as is his measure, by so much he thus lays vigour into them.\n\n6:3:2:66\\. He then makes them walk forward to the east: he thus searches for\nhim (Agni) by means of these animals. He does not touch (them) lest he, Agni,\nshould injure him; for Agni is the same as the animals 1.\n\n6:3:2:77\\. He makes the horse walk on, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 15), 'Forth-\nspeeding, come treading down the curses!'--curse means evil: thus, 'running\ncome, treading down the evil!'--'come, delighting, into Rudra's\nchieftainship!'--beasts belong to Rudra: thus, 'come thou, delighting, into\nthe chieftainship of him who is thy deity!' he thus searches for him by means\nof the horse.\n\n6:3:2:88\\. Then the ass with, Traverse the wide air, thou possessed of\nprosperous pastures and affording safety!'--as the text, so its\nmeaning;--'with Pushan as thy mate;'--Pushan, doubtless, is this earth; thus,\n'together with her as thy mate:' he thus searches for him by means of the ass.\n\n6:3:2:99\\. Then the he-goat, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 16), 'From the Earth's seat,\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, bring thou Agni Purishya!'--that is, 'from the Earth's lap bring\nthou Agni, favourable to cattle, as Agni (did)!' he thus searches for him\n(Agni) by means of the he-goat.\n\n6:3:2:1010\\. With three (animals) he searches,--threefold is Agni: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus searches for him.\n\np. 206\n\n[paragraph continues] By three (formulas) he first addresses (the beasts);\nthat makes six,--six seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[204:1](sbe4135.htm#fr_416) Praturtam, 'sped forward, speeding forward.'\n\n[204:2](sbe4135.htm#fr_417) Asmayu, 'tending towards us, favourable to us,' is\nexplained differently by the author of the Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[204:3](sbe4135.htm#fr_418) The author here, as elsewhere, rather takes 'va\n_g_ a' in the sense of 'strength, sustenance.'\n\n[205:1](sbe4135.htm#fr_419) The text here has the ordinary Sanskrit\nconstruction, running literally thus:--he does not touch--Agni (being) the\nsame as the animals--'lest he, Agni, should injure me!'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 3, 3.
