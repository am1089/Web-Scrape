Thereafter Restfulness, Control, Endurance; a perfect\nRenouncing of all acts that cling and stain.\n\nThereafter, the divine Word, a turning of the mind to it, a constant thinking\non it by the pure one, long and uninterrupted.\n\nThen ridding himself altogether of doubt, and reaching wisdom, even here he\nenjoys the bliss of Nirvana.\n\nThen the discerning between Self and not-Self that you must now awaken to,\nthat I now declare, hearing it, lay hold on it within yourself.\n\n### THE VESTURES\n\n(Verses 72--107)\n\nFormed of the substances they call marrow, bone, fat, flesh, blood, skin and\nover-skin; fitted with greater and lesser limbs, feet, breast, trunk, arms,\nback, head; this is called the physical vesture by the wise--the vesture whose\nauthority, as "I" and "my" is declared to be a delusion.\n\nThen these are the refined elements: the ethereal, the upper air, the flaming,\nwater, and earth.\n\nThese when mingled one with another become the physical elements, that are the\ncauses of the physical vesture. The materials of them become the five sensuous\nthings that are for the delight of the enjoyer--sounds and other things of\nsense.\n\np. 18\n\nThey who, fooled in these sensuous things, are bound by the wide noose of\nlust, hard to break asunder--they come and go, downwards and upwards on high,\nled by the swift messenger, their works.\n\nThrough the five sensuous things five creatures find dissolution to the five\nelements, each one bound by his own character: the deer, the elephant, the\nmoth, the fish, the bee; what then of man, who is snared by all the five?\n\nSensuous things are keener to injure than the black snake\'s venom; poison\nslays only him who eats it, but these things slay only him who beholds them\nwith his eyes.\n\nHe who is free from the great snare, so hard to be rid of, of longing after\nsensuous things, he indeed builds for Freedom, and not another, even though\nknowing the six philosophies.\n\nThose who, only for a little while rid of lust, long to be free, and struggle\nto reach the shore of the world-ocean--the toothed beast of longing lust makes\nthem sink half way, seizing them by the throat, and swiftly carrying them\naway.\n\nBy whom this toothed beast called sensuous things is slain by the sharp sword\nof true turning away from lust, he reaches the world-sea\'s shore without\nhindrance. He who, soul-destroyed, treads the rough path of sensuous things,\ndeath is his reward, like him who goes out on a luckless day. But he who goes\nonward, through the word of the good Teacher who is friendly to all beings,\nand himself well-controlled, he gains the fruit and the reward, and his reward\nis the Real.\n\np. 19\n\nIf the love of Freedom is yours, then put sensuous things far away from you,\nlike poison. But love, as the food of the gods, serenity, pity, pardon,\nrectitude, peacefulness and self-control; love them and honor them forever.\n\nHe who every moment leaving undone what should be done--the freeing of himself\nfrom the bonds of beginningless unwisdom--devotes himself to the fattening of\nhis body, that rightly exists for the good of the other powers, such a one\nthereby destroys himself.\n\nHe who seeks to behold the Self, although living to fatten his body, is going\nto cross the river, holding to a toothed beast, while thinking it a tree.\n\nFor this delusion for the body and its delights is a great death for him who\nlongs for Freedom; the delusion by the overcoming of which he grows worthy of\nthe dwelling-place of the free.\n\nDestroy this great death, this infatuation for the body, wives and sons;\nconquering it, the pure ones reach the Pervader\'s supreme abode.\n\nThis faulty form, built up of skin and flesh, of blood and sinews, fat and\nmarrow and bones, gross and full of impure elements;\n\nBorn of the fivefold physical elements through deeds done before, the physical\nplace of enjoyment of the Self; its mode is waking life, whereby there arises\nexperience of physical things.\n\nSubservient to physical objects through the outer powers, with its various\njoys--flower-chaplets, sandal, lovers--the Life makes itself like this through\nthe\n\np. 20\n\npower of the Self; therefore this form is pre-eminent in waking life.\n\nBut know that this physical body wherein the whole circling life of the Spirit\nadheres, is but as the dwelling of the lord of the dwelling.\n\nBirth and age and death are the fate of the physical and all the physical\nchanges from childhood onward; of the physical body only are caste and grade\nwith their many homes, and differences of worship and dishonor and great honor\nbelong to it alone.\n\nThe powers of knowing--hearing, touch, sight, smell, taste--for apprehending\nsensuous things; the powers of doing--voice, hands, feet, the powers that put\nforth and generate--to effect deeds.\n\nThen the inward activity: mind, soul, self-assertion, imagination, with their\nproper powers; mind, ever intending and doubting; soul, with its character of\ncertainty as to things; self-assertion, that falsely attributes the notion of\n"I"; imagination, with its power of gathering itself together, and directing\nitself to its object.\n\nThese also are the life-breaths: the forward-life, the downward-life, the\ndistributing-life, the uniting-life; heir activities and forms are different,\nas gold and water are different.\n\nThe subtle vesture they call the eightfold inner being made up thus: voice and\nthe other four, hearing and the other four, ether and the other four, the\nforward life and the other four, soul and the other inward activities,\nunwisdom, desire, and action.\n\nHear now about this subtle vesture or form vesture,\n\np.\n\nborn of elements not fivefolded; it is the place of gratification, the enjoyer\nof the fruits of deeds, the beginningless disguise of the Self, through lack\nof self-knowledge.\n\nDream-life is the mode of its expansion, where it shines with reflected light,\nthrough the traces of its own impressions; for in dream-life the knowing soul\nshines of itself through the many and varied mind-pictures made during waking-\nlife.\n\nHere the higher self shines of itself and rules, taking on the condition of\ndoer, with pure thought as its disguise, an unaffected witness, nor is it\nstained by the actions, there done, as it is not attached to them, therefore\nit is not stained by actions, whatever they be, done by its disguise; let this\nform-vesture be the minister, doing the work of the conscious self, the real\nman, just as the tools do the carpenter\'s work; thus this self remains\nunattached.\n\nBlindness or slowness or skill come from the goodness or badness of the eye;\ndeafness and dumbness are of the ear and not of the Knower, the Self.\n\nUp-breathing, down-breathing, yawning, sneezing, the forward moving of breath,\nand the outward moving--these are the doings of the life-breaths, say those\nwho know these things; of the life-breaths, also, hunger and thirst are\nproperties.\n\nThe inner activity dwells and shines in sight and the other powers in the\nbody, through the false attribution of selfhood, as cause.\n\nSelf-assertion is to be known as the cause of this false attribution of\nselfhood, as doer and enjoyer; and\n\np. 22\n\nthrough substance and the other two potencies, it reaches expansion in the\nthree modes.\n\nWhen sensuous things have affinity with it, it is happy; when the contrary,\nunhappy. So happiness and unhappiness are properties of this, and not of the\nSelf which is perpetual bliss.\n\nSensuous things are dear for the sake of the self, and not for their own sake;\nand therefore the Self itself is dearest of all.\n\nHence the Self itself is perpetual bliss--not for it are happiness and\nunhappiness; as in dreamless life, where are no sensuous things, the Self that\nis bliss--is enjoyed, so in waking-life it is enjoyed through the word,\nthrough intuition, teaching and deduction.\n\n### THE THREE POTENCIES\n\n(Verses 108--135)\n\nThe power of the supreme Master, that is called unmanifested, beginningless\nunwisdom whose very self is the three potencies, to be known through thought,\nby its workings--this is glamor (Maya), whereby all this moving world is made\nto grow.\n\nNeither being nor non-being nor of the self of both of these; neither divided\nnor undivided nor of the self of both of these; neither formed nor formless\nnor of the self of both of these--very wonderful and ineffable is its form.\n\nTo be destroyed by the awakening to the pure, secondless Eternal, as the\nserpent imagined in a rope, when the rope is seen; its potencies are called\nsubstance, force, and darkness; each of them known by their workings.\n\np. 23\n\n[paragraph continues] The self of doing belongs to force, whose power is\nextension, whence the pre-existent activities issued; rage and all the changes\nof the mind that cause sorrow are ever its results.\n\nDesire, wrath, greed, vanity, malice, self-assertion, jealousy, envy, are the\nterrible works of Force, its activities in man; therefore this is the cause of\nbondage.\n\nThen enveloping is the power of Darkness, whereby a thing appears as something\nelse; this is the cause of the circling birth and rebirth of the spirit, and\nthe cause whereby extension is drawn forward.\n\nThough a man be full of knowledge, learned, skillful, very subtle-sighted, if\nDarkness has wrapped him round, he sees not, though he be full of manifold\ninstruction; he calls good that which is raised by error, and leans upon its\nproperties, unlucky man that he is; great and hard to end is the enveloping\npower of Darkness.\n\nWrong thinking, contradictory thinking, fanciful thinking, confused thinking--\nthese are its workings; this power of extension never leaves hold of one who\nhas come into contact with it, but perpetually sends him this way and that.\n\nUnwisdom, sluggishness, inertness, sloth, infatuation, folly, and things like\nthese are of the potency of Darkness. Under the yoke of these he knows nothing\nat all, but remains as though asleep or like a post.\n\nBut the potency of substance is pure like water, and even though mixed with\nthe other two, it builds for the true refuge; for it is a reflected spark of\nthe Self, and lights up the inert like the sun.\n\np. 24\n\nOf the potency of Substance when mixed the properties are self-respect, self-\nrestraint, control, faith and love and the longing to be free, a godlike power\nand a turning back from the unreal.\n\nOf the potency of substance altogether pure the properties are grace, direct\nperception of the Self, and perfect peace; exulting gladness, a resting on the\nSelf supreme, whereby he reaches the essence of real bliss.\n\nThe unmanifest is characterized by these three potencies; it is the causal\nvesture of the Self; dreamless life is the mode where it lives freely, all the\nactivities of the powers, and even of the knowing soul having sunk back into\nit.\n\nEvery form of outward perceiving has come to rest, the knowing soul becomes\nlatent in the Self from which it springs; the name of this is dreamless life,\nwherein he says "I know nothing at all of the noise of the moving world."\n\nThe body, powers, life-breaths, mind, self-assertion, all changes, sensuous\nthings, happiness, unhappiness, the ether and all the elements, the whole\nworld up to the unmanifest--this is not Self.\n\nGlamor and every work of glamor from the world-soul to the body, know this as\nunreal, as not the Self, built up of the mirage of the desert.\n\nBut I shall declare to you the own being of the Self supreme, knowing which a\nman, freed from his bonds, reaches the lonely purity.\n\nThere is a certain selfhood wherein the sense of "I" forever rests; who\nwitnesses the three modes of being, who is other than the five veils; who is\nthe only knower\n\np. 25\n\nin waking, dreaming, dreamlessness; of all the activities of the knowing soul,\nwhether good or bad--this is the "I";\n\nWho of himself beholds all; whom none beholds; who kindles to consciousness\nthe knowing soul and all the powers; whom none kindles to consciousness; by\nwhom all this is filled; whom no other fills; who is the shining light within\nthis all; after whose shining all else shines;\n\nBy whose nearness only body and powers and mind and soul do their work each in\nhis own field, as though sent by the Self;\n\nBecause the own nature of this is eternal wakefulness, self-assertion, the\nbody and all the powers, and happiness and unhappiness are beheld by it, just\nas an earthen pot is beheld. This inner Self, the ancient Spirit, is\neverlasting, partless, immediately experienced happiness; ever of one nature,\npure waking knowledge, sent forth by whom Voice and the life-breaths move.\n\nHere, verily, in the substantial Self, in the bidden place of the soul, this\nsteady shining begins to shine like the dawn; then the shining shines forth as\nthe noonday sun, making all this world to shine by its inherent light; knower\nof all the changing moods of mind and inward powers; of all the acts done by\nbody, powers, life-breaths; present in them as fire in iron, strives not nor\nchanges at all.\n\nThis is not born nor dies nor grows, nor does it fade or change forever; even\nwhen this form has melted away, it no more melts than the air in a jar.\n\nAlike stranger to forming and deforming; of its own\n\np. 26\n\nbeing, pure wakefulness; both being and non-being is this, besides it there is\nnothing else; this shines unchanging, this Supreme Self gleams in waking,\ndream and dreamlessness as "I," present as the witness of the knowing soul.\n\n### BONDAGE AND FREEDOM\n\n(Verses 136--153)\n\nThen, holding firmly mind, with knowing soul at rest, know your self within\nyourself face to face saying, "This am I" The life-ocean, whose waves are\nbirth and dying, is shoreless; cross over it, fulfilling the end of being,\nresting firm in the Eternal.\n\nThinking things not self are "I"--this is bondage for a man; this, arising\nfrom unwisdom, is the cause of falling into the weariness of birth and dying;\nthis is the cause that he feeds and anoints and guards this form, thinking it\nthe Self; the unreal, real; wrapping himself in sensuous things as a silk-worm\nin his own threads.\n\nThe thought that what is not That is That grows up in the fool through\ndarkness; because no discernment is there, it wells up, as the thought that a\nrope is a snake; thereupon a mighty multitude of fatuities fall on him who\naccepts this error, for he who grasps the unreal is bound; mark this, my\ncompanion.\n\nBy the power of wakefulness, partless, external, secondless, the Self wells up\nwith its endless lordship; but this enveloping power wraps it round, born of\nDarkness, as the dragon of eclipse envelops the rayed sun.\n\nWhen the real Self with its stainless light recedes, a\n\np. 27\n\nman thinking "this body is I," calls it the Self; then by lust and hate and\nall the potencies of bondage, the great power of Force that they call\nextension greatly afflicts him.\n\nTorn by the gnawing of the toothed beast of great delusion; wandered from the\nSelf, accepting every changing mood of mind as himself, through this potency,\nin the shoreless ocean of birth and death, full of the poison of sensuous\nthings, sinking and rising, he wanders, mean-minded, despicable-minded.\n\nAs a line of clouds, born of the sun\'s strong shining, expands before the sun\nand hides it from sight, so self-assertion, that has come into being through\nthe Self, expands before the Self and hides it from sight. As when on an evil\nday the lord of day is swallowed up in thick, dark clouds, an ice-cold\nhurricane of wind, very terrible, afflicts the clouds in turns; so when the\nSelf is enveloped in impenetrable Darkness, the keen power of extension drives\nwith many afflictions the man whose soul is deluded.\n\nFrom those two powers a man\'s bondage comes; deluded by them he errs, thinking\nthe body is the Self.\n\nOf the plant of birth and death, the seed is Darkness, the sprout is the\nthought that body is Self, the shoot is rage, the sap is deeds, the body is\nthe stem, the life-breaths are the branches, the tops are the bodily powers,\nsensuous things are the flowers, sorrow is the fruit, born of varied deeds and\nmanifold; and the Life is the bird that eats the fruit.\n\nThis bondage to what is not Self, rooted in unwisdom, innate, made manifest\nwithout beginning or end, gives\n\np. 28\n\nlife to the falling torrent of sorrow, of birth and death, of sickness and old\nage.\n\nNot by weapons nor arms, not by storm nor fire nor by a myriad deeds can this\nbe cut off, without the sword of discernment and knowledge, very sharp and\nbright, through the grace of the guiding power.\n\nHe who is single-minded, fixed on the word divine, his steadfast fulfilment of\nduty will make the knowing soul within him pure; to him whose knowing soul is\npure, a knowing of the Self supreme shall come; and through this knowledge of\nthe Self supreme he shall destroy this circle of birth and death and its root\ntogether.\n\n### THE FREEING OF THE SELF\n\n(Verses 148--154)\n\nThe Self, wrapped up in the five vestures beginning with the vesture formed of\nfood, which are brought into being by its own power, does not shine forth, as\nthe water in the pond, covered by a veil of green scum.\n\nWhen the green scum is taken away, immediately the water shines forth pure,\ntaking away thirst and heat, straightway becoming a source of great joy to\nman.\n\nWhen the five vestures have been stripped off, the Self shines forth pure, the\none essence of eternal bliss, beheld within, supreme, self-luminous.\n\nDiscernment is to be made between the Self and what is not Self by the wise\nman seeking freedom from bondage; through this he enters into joy, knowing the\nSelf which is being, consciousness, bliss.\n\nAs the reed from the tiger grass, so separating from the congeries of things\nvisible the hidden Self within,\n\np. 29\n\nwhich is detached, not involved in actions, and dissolving all in the Self, he\nwho stands thus, has attained liberation.\n\n### THE VESTURE FORMED OF FOOD\n\n(Verses 154--164)\n\nThe food-formed vesture is this body, which comes into being through food,\nwhich lives by food, which perishes without food.\n\nIt is formed of cuticle, skin, flesh, blood, bone, water; this is not worthy\nto be the Self, eternally pure.\n\nThe Self was before birth or death, and now is; how can it be born for the\nmoment, fleeting, unstable of nature, not unified, inert, beheld like a jar?\nFor the Self is the witness of all changes of form.\n\nThe body has hands and feet, not the Self; though bodiless, yet because it is\nthe Life, because its power is indestructible, it is controller, not\ncontrolled.\n\nSince the Self is witness of the body, its character, its acts, its states,\ntherefore the Self must be of other nature than the body.\n\nA mass of wretchedness, clad in flesh, full of impurity and evil, how can this\nbody be the knower? The Self is of other nature.\n\nOf this compound of skin, flesh, fat, bone and water, the man of deluded mind\nthinks, "This is I"; but he who is possessed of judgment knows that his true\nSelf is of other character, is nature transcendental.\n\nThe mind of the dullard thinks of the body, "This is I"; he who is more\nlearned thinks, "This is I," of the body and the separate self; but he who has\nattained\n\np. 30\n\ndiscernment and is wise knows the true Self saying, "I am the Eternal."\n\nTherefore, O thou of mind deluded, put away the thought that this body is the\nSelf, this compound of skin, flesh, fat, bone and water; discern the universal\nSelf, the Eternal, changeless, and enjoy supreme peace.\n\nSo long as the man of learning abandons not the thought, founded on delusion,\nthat "This is I," regarding the unenduring body and its powers, so long there\nis no hope for his liberation, though he possess the knowledge of the Vedanta\nand its sciences.\n\nAs thou hast no thought that "This is the Self," regarding the body\'s shadow,\nor the reflected form, or the body seen in dream, or the shape imagined in the\nmind, so let not this thought exist regarding the living body.\n\nThe thought that the body is the Self, in the minds of men who discern not the\nreal, is the seed from which spring birth and death and sorrow; therefore slay\nthou this thought with strong effort, for when thou hast abandoned this\nthought the longing for rebirth will cease.\n\n### THE VESTURE FORMED OF VITAL BREATH\n\n(Verses 165--166)\n\nThe breath-formed vesture is formed by the life-breath determined by the five\npowers of action; through its power the food-formed vesture, guided by the\nSelf and sustained by food, moves in all bodily acts.\n\nNor is this breath-formed vesture the Self, since it is formed of the vital\nairs, coming and going like the wind, moving within and without; since it can\nin no\n\np. 31\n\nwise discern between right and wrong, between oneself and another, but is ever\ndependent.\n\n### THE VESTURE FORMED OF MIND\n\n(Verses 167--183)\n\nThe mind-formed vesture is formed of the powers of perception and the mind; it\nis the cause of the distinction between the notions of "mine" and "I"; it is\nactive in making a distinction of names and numbers; as more potent, it\npervades and dominates the former vesture.\n\nThe fire of the mind-formed vesture, fed by the five powers of perception, as\nthough by five sacrificial priests, with objects of sense like streams of\nmelted butter, blazing with the fuel of manifold sense-impressions, sets the\npersonality aflame.\n\nFor there is no unwisdom, except in the mind, for the mind is unwisdom, the\ncause of the bondage to life; when this is destroyed, all is destroyed; when\nthis dominates, the world dominates.\n\nIn dream, devoid of substance, it emanates a world of experiencer and things\nexperienced, which is all mind; so in waking consciousness, there is no\ndifference, it is all the domination of the mind.\n\nDuring the time of dreamlessness, when mind has become latent, nothing at all\nof manifestation remains; therefore man\'s circle of birth and death is built\nby mind, and has no permanent reality.\n\nBy the wind a cloud is collected, by the wind it is driven away again; by mind\nbondage is built up, by mind is built also liberation.\n\np. 32\n\nBuilding up desire for the body and all objects, it binds the man thereby as\nan ox by a cord; afterwards leading him to turn from them like poison, that\nsame mind, verily, sets him free from bondage.\n\nTherefore mind is the cause of man\'s bondage, and in turn of his liberation;\nwhen darkened by the powers of passion it is the cause of bondage, and when\npure of passion and darkness it is the cause of liberation.\n\nWhere discernment and dispassion are dominant, gaining purity, the mind makes\nfor liberation; therefore let the wise man who seeks liberation strengthen\nthese two in himself as the first step.\n\nMind is the name of the mighty tiger that hunts in the forest glades of\nsensuous things; let not the wise go thither, who seek liberation.\n\nMind moulds all sensuous things through the earthly body and the subtle body\nof him who experiences; mind ceaselessly shapes the differences of body, of\ncolor, of condition, of race, as fruits caused by the acts of the potencies.\n\nMind, beclouding the detached, pure consciousness, binding it with the cords\nof the body, the powers, the life-breaths, as "I" and "my," ceaselessly strays\namong the fruits of experience caused by its own activities.\n\nMan\'s circle of birth and death comes through the fault of attributing reality\nto the unreal, but this false attribution is built up by mind; this is the\neffective cause of birth and death and sorrow for him who has the faults of\npassion and darkness and is without discernment.\n\nTherefore the wise who know the truth have declared\n\np. 33\n\nthat mind is unwisdom, through which the whole world, verily, is swept about,\nas cloud belts by the wind.\n\nTherefore purification of the mind should be undertaken with strong effort by\nhim who seeks liberation; when the mind has been purified, liberation comes\nlike fruit into his hand.\n\nThrough the sole power of liberation uprooting desire for sensuous things, and\nridding himself of all bondage to works, he who through faith in the Real\nstands firm in the teaching, shakes off the very essence of passion from the\nunderstanding.\n\nThe mind-formed vesture cannot be the higher Self, since it has beginning and\nend, waxing and waning; by causing sensuous things, it is the very essence of\npain; that which is itself seen cannot be the Seer.\n\n### THE VESTURE FORMED OF INTELLIGENCE\n\n(Verses 184--197)\n\nThe intelligence, together with the powers of intelligence, makes the\nintelligence-formed vesture, whose distinguishing character is actorship; it\nis the cause of man\'s circle of birth and death.\n\nThe power which is a reflected beam of pure Consciousness, called the\nunderstanding, is a mode of abstract Nature; it possesses wisdom and creative\npower; it thereby focuses the idea of "I" in the body and its powers.\n\nThis "I," beginningless in time, is the separate self, it is the initiator of\nall undertakings; this, impelled by previous imprints, works all works both\nholy and unholy, and forms their fruits.\n\np. 34\n\nPassing through varying births it gains experience, now descending, now\nascending; of this intelligence-formed vesture, waking, dream and\ndreamlessness are the fields where it experiences pleasure and pain.\n\nBy constantly attributing to itself the body, state, condition, duties and\nworks, thinking, "These are mine," this intelligence-formed vesture, brightly\nshining because it stands closest to the higher Self, becomes the vesture of\nthe Self, and, thinking itself to be the Self, wanders in the circle of birth\nand death.\n\nThis, formed of intelligence, is the light that shines in the vital breaths,\nin the heart; the Self who stands forever wears this vesture as actor and\nexperiencer.\n\nThe Self, assuming the limitation of the intelligence, self-deluded by the\nerror of the intelligence, though it is the universal Self, yet views itself\nas separate from the Self; as the potter views the jars as separate from the\nclay.\n\nThrough the force of its union with the vesture, the higher Self takes on the\ncharacter of the vesture and assumes its nature, as fire, which is without\nform, takes on the varying forms of the iron, even though the Self is for ever\nby nature uniform and supreme.\n\n### THE DISCIPLE SPEAKS\n\nWhether by delusion or otherwise, the higher Self appears as the separate\nself; but, since the vesture is beginningless, there is no conceivable end of\nthe beginningless.\n\nTherefore existence as the separate self must be eternal, nor can the circle\nof birth and death have an\n\np. 35\n\nend; how then can there be liberation? Master, tell me this.\n\n### THE MASTER ANSWERS\n\nWell hast thou asked, O wise one! Therefore rightly bear! A false imagination\ncreated by error is not conclusive proof.\n\nOnly through delusion can there be an association with objects, of that which\nis without attachment, without action, without form; it is like the\nassociation of blueness with the sky.\n\nThe appearance as the separate self, of the Self, the Seer, who is without\nqualities, without form; essential wisdom and bliss, arises through the\ndelusion of the understanding; it is not real; when the delusion passes, it\nexists no longer, having no substantial reality.\n\nIts existence, which is brought into being through false perception, because\nof delusion, lasts only so long as the error lasts; as the serpent in the rope\nendures only as long as the delusion; when the delusion ceases, there is no\nserpent.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Witness](cjw07.htm)\n\n'
