V.\n\nVishn\xcc\x81u as Brahma creates the world. General characteristics of creation.\nBrahma meditates, and gives origin to, immovable things, animals, gods, men.\nSpecific creation of nine kinds; Mahat, Tanmatra, Aindriya, inanimate objects,\nanimals, gods, men, Anugraha, and Kaumara. More particular account of\ncreation. Origin of different orders of beings from Brahma\'s body under\ndifferent conditions; and of the Vedas from his mouths. All things created\nagain as they existed in a former Kalpa.\n\nMAITREYA.--Now unfold to me, Brahman, how this deity created the gods, sages,\nprogenitors, demons, men, animals, trees, and the rest, that abide on earth,\nin heaven, or in the waters: how Brahma at creation made the world with the\nqualities, the characteristics, and the forms of things 1.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--I will explain to you, Maitreya, listen attentively, how this\ndeity, the lord of all, created the gods and other beings.\n\nWhilst he (Brahma) formerly, in the beginning of the Kalpas, was. meditating\non creation, there appeared a creation beginning with ignorance, and\nconsisting of darkness. From that great being appeared fivefold Ignorance,\nconsisting of obscurity, illusion, extreme illusion, gloom, utter darkness 2.\nThe creation of the creator thus plunged in\n\np. 35\n\nabstraction, was the fivefold (immovable) world, without intellect or\nreflection, void of perception or sensation, incapable of feeling, and\ndestitute of motion 3. Since immovable things were first created, this is\ncalled the first creation. Brahma, beholding that it was defective, designed\nanother; and whilst he thus meditated, the animal creation was manifested, to\nthe products of which the term Tiryaksrotas is applied, from their nutriment\nfollowing a winding course 4. These were called beasts, &c., and their\ncharacteristic was the quality of darkness, they being destitute of knowledge,\nuncontrolled in their conduct, and mistaking error for wisdom; being formed of\negotism and self-esteem, labouring under the twenty-eight kinds of\nimperfection 5, manifesting inward sensations, and associating with each other\n(according to their kinds).\n\np. 36\n\nBeholding this creation also imperfect, Brahma again meditated, and a third\ncreation appeared, abounding with the quality of goodness, termed \xc3\x9arddhasrotas\n6. The beings thus produced in the \xc3\x9arddhasrotas creation were endowed with\npleasure and enjoyment, unencumbered internally or externally, and luminous\nwithin and without. This, termed the creation of immortals, was the third\nperformance of Brahma, who, although well pleased with it, still found it\nincompetent to fulfil his end. Continuing therefore his meditations, there\nsprang, in consequence of his infallible purpose, the creation termed\nArvaksrotas, from indiscrete nature. The products of this are termed\nArvaksrotasas 7, from the downward current (of their nutriment). They abound\nwith the light of knowledge, but the qualities of darkness and of foulness\npredominate. Hence they are afflicted by evil, and are repeatedly impelled to\naction. They have knowledge both externally and internally, and are the\ninstruments (of accomplishing the object of creation, the liberation of soul).\nThese creatures were mankind.\n\nI have thus explained to you, excellent Muni, six 8 creations. The first\ncreation was that of Mahat or Intellect, which is also called the creation of\nBrahma 9. The second was that of the rudimental principles (Tanmatras), thence\ntermed the elemental creation (Bhuta serga). The third was the modified form\nof egotism, termed the organic creation, or creation of the senses\n(Aindriyaka). These three were the Prakrita creations, the developements of\nindiscrete nature, preceded by the indiscrete\n\np. 37\n\nprinciple 10. The fourth or fundamental creation (of perceptible things) was\nthat of inanimate bodies. The fifth, the Tairyag yonya creation, was that of\nanimals. The sixth was the \xc3\x9arddhasrotas creation, or that of the divinities.\nThe creation of the Arvaksrotas beings was the seventh, and was that of man.\nThere is an eighth creation, termed Anugraha, which possesses both the\nqualities of goodness and darkness 11. Of these creations, five are secondary,\nand three are primary 12. But there is a ninth,\n\np. 38\n\nthe Kaumara creation, which is both primary and secondary 13. These are the\nnine creations of the great progenitor of all, and, both as primary\n\np. 39\n\nand secondary, are the radical causes of the world, proceeding from the\nsovereign creator. What else dost thou desire to hear?\n\nMAITREYA. Thou hast briefly related to me, Muni, the creation of the gods and\nother beings: I am desirous, chief of sages, to hear from thee a more ample\naccount of their creation.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Created beings, although they are destroyed (in their individual\nforms) at the periods of dissolution, yet, being affected by the good or evil\nacts of former existence, they are never exempted from their consequences; and\nwhen Brahma creates the world anew, they are the progeny of his will, in the\nfourfold condition of gods, men, animals, or inanimate things. Brahma then,\nbeing desirous of creating the four orders of beings, termed gods, demons,\nprogenitors, and men, collected his mind into itself 14. Whilst thus\nconcentrated, the quality of darkness\n\np. 40\n\npervaded his body; and thence the demons (the Asuras) were first born, issuing\nfrom his thigh. Brahma then abandoned that form which was, composed of the\nrudiment of darkness, and which, being deserted by him, became night.\nContinuing to create, but assuming a different. shape, he experienced\npleasure; and thence from his mouth proceeded the gods, endowed with the\nquality of goodness. The form abandoned by him, became day, in which the good\nquality predominates; and hence by day the gods are most powerful, and by\nnight the demons. He next adopted another person, in which the rudiment of\ngoodness also prevailed; and thinking of himself, as the father of the world,\nthe progenitors (the Pitris) were born from his side. The body, when he\nabandoned, it, became the Sandhya (or evening twilight), the interval between\nday and night. Brahma then assumed another person, pervaded by the quality of\nfoulness; and from this, men, in whom foulness (or passion) predominates, were\nproduced. Quickly abandoning that body, it became morning twilight, or the\ndawn. At the appearance of this light of day, men feel most vigour; while the\nprogenitors are most powerful in the evening season. In this manner, Maitreya,\nJyotsna (dawn), Ratri (night), Ahar (day), and Sandhya (evening), are the four\nbodies of Brahma invested by the three qualities 15.\n\np. 41\n\nNext from Brahma, in a form composed of the quality of foulness, was produced\nhunger, of whom anger was born: and the god put forth in darkness beings\nemaciate with hunger, of hideous aspects, and with long beards. Those beings\nhastened to the deity. Such of them as exclaimed, Oh preserve us! were thence\ncalled Rakshasas 16: others, who cried out, Let us eat, were denominated from\nthat expression Yakshas 17. Beholding them so disgusting, the hairs of Brahma\nwere shrivelled up, and first falling from his head, were again renewed upon\nit: from their falling they became serpents, called Sarpa from their creeping,\nand Ahi because they had deserted the head 18. The creator of the world, being\nincensed, then created fierce beings, who were denominated goblins, Bhutas,\nmalignant fiends and eaters of flesh. The Gandharbas were next born, imbibing\nmelody: drinking of the goddess of speech, they were born, and thence their\nappellation 19.\n\nThe divine Brahma, influenced by their material energies, having created these\nbeings, made others of his own will. Birds he formed from his vital vigour;\nsheep from his breast; goats from his mouth; kine from his belly and sides;\nand horses, elephants, Sarabhas, Gayals, deer, camels, mules, antelopes, and\nother animals, from his feet: whilst from the hairs of his body sprang herbs,\nroots, and fruits.\n\nBrahma having created, in the commencement of the Kalpa, various plants,\nemployed them in sacrifices, in the beginning of the Treta age. Animals were\ndistinguished into two classes, domestic (village) and wild (forest): the\nfirst class contained the cow, the goat, the hog, the sheep, the horse, the\nass, the mule: the latter, all beasts of prey, and many animals with cloven\nhoofs, the elephant, and the monkey. The fifth order were the birds; the\nsixth, aquatic animals; and the seventh, reptiles and insects 20.\n\np. 42\n\nFrom his eastern mouth Brahma then created the Gayatri metre, the Rig veda,\nthe collection of hymns termed Trivrit, the Rathantara portion of the Sama\nveda, and the Agnisht\xcc\x81oma sacrifice: from his southern mouth he created the\nYajur veda, the Trisht\xcc\x81ubh metre, the collection of hymns called Panchada\xc5\x9ba,\nthe Vrihat Sama, and the portion of the Sama veda termed Uktha: from his\nwestern mouth he created the Sama veda, the Jayati metre, the collection of\nhymns termed Saptada\xc5\x9ba, the portion of the Sama called Vairupa, and the\nAtiratra sacrifice: and from his northern mouth he created the Ekavinsa\ncollection of hymns, the At\xcc\x81harva veda, the \xc3\x81ptoryama rite, the Anusht\xcc\x81ubh\nmetre, and the Vairaja portion of the Sama veda 21.\n\nIn this manner all creatures, great or small, proceeded from his limbs. The\ngreat progenitor of the world having formed the gods, demons, and Pitris,\ncreated, in the commencement of the Kalpa, the Yakshas, Pisachas (goblins),\nGandharbas and the troops of Apsarasas the nymphs of heaven, Naras (centaurs,\nor beings with the limbs of horses and human\n\np. 43\n\nbodies) and Kinnaras (beings with the heads of horses), Rakshasas, birds,\nbeasts, deer, serpents, and all things permanent or transitory, movable or\nimmovable. This did the divine Brahma, the first creator and lord of all: and\nthese things being created, discharged the same functions as they had\nfulfilled in a previous creation, whether malignant or benign, gentle or\ncruel, good or evil, true or false; and accordingly as they are actuated by\nsuch propensities will be their conduct.\n\nAnd the creator displayed infinite variety in the objects of sense, in the\nproperties of living things, and in the forms of bodies: he determined in the\nbeginning, by the authority of the Vedas, the names and forms and functions of\nall creatures, and of the gods; and the names and appropriate offices of the\nRishis, as they also are read in the Vedas. In like manner as the products of\nthe seasons designate in periodical revolution the return of the same season,\nso do the same circumstances indicate the recurrence of the same Yuga, or age;\nand thus, in the beginning of each Kalpa, does Brahma repeatedly create the\nworld, possessing the power that is derived from the will to create, and\nassisted by the natural and essential faculty of the object to be created.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[34:1](vp039.htm#fr_167) The terms here employed are for qualities, Gunas;\nwhich, as we have already noticed, are those of goodness, foulness, and\ndarkness. The characteristics, or Swabhavas, are the inherent properties of\nthe qualities, by which they act, as, soothing, terrific, or stupifying: and\nthe forms, Swarupas, are the distinctions of biped, quadruped, brute, bird,\nfish, and the like.\n\n[34:2](vp039.htm#fr_168) Or Tamas, Moha, Mahamoha, Tamisra, Andhatamisra; they\nare the five kinds of obstruction, viparyyaya, of soul\'s liberation, according\nto the Sankhya: they are explained to be, 1. The belief of material substance\nbeing the same with spirit; 2. Notion of property or possession, and\nconsequent attachment to objects, as children and the like, as being one\'s\nown; 3. Addiction to the enjoyments of sense; 4. Impatience or wrath; and 5.\nFear of privation or death. They are called in the Patanjala philosophy, the\nfive afflictions, Kle\xc5\x9ba, but are similarly explained by Avidya, \'ignorance;\'\nAsmita, \'selfishness,\' literally \'I-am-ness;\' Raga \'love;\' Dwesha, \'hatred;\'\nand Abhinive\xc5\x9ba, \'dread of temporal suffering.\' Sankhya Karika, p. 148-150.\nThis creation by Brahma p. 35 in the Varaha Kalpa begins in the same way, and\nin the same words, in most of the Puran\xcc\x81as. The Bhagavata reverses the order\nof these five products, and gives them, Andhatamisra, Tamisra, Mahamoha, Moha,\nand Tamas; a variation obviously more immethodical than the usual reading of\nthe text, and adopted, no doubt, merely for the sake of giving the passage an\nair of originality.\n\n[35:3](vp039.htm#fr_169) This is not to be confounded with elementary\ncreation, although the description would very well apply to that of crude\nnature, or Pradhana; but, as will be seen presently, we have here to do with\nfinal productions, or the forms in which the previously created elements and\nfaculties are more or less perfectly aggregated. The first class of these\nforms is here said to be immovable things; that is, the mineral and vegetable\nkingdoms; for the solid earth, with its mountains and rivers and seas, was\nalready prepared for their reception. The \'fivefold\' immovable creation is\nindeed, according to the comment, restricted to vegetables, five orders of\nwhich are enumerated, or, 1. trees; 2. shrubs; 3. climbing plants; 4.\ncreepers; and 5. grasses.\n\n[35:4](vp039.htm#fr_170) Tiryak, \'crooked;\' and Srotas, \'a canal.\'\n\n[35:5](vp039.htm#fr_171) Twenty-eight kinds of Badhas, which in the Sankhya\nsystem mean disabilities, as defects of the senses, blindness, deafness, &c.;\nand defects of intellect, discontent, ignorance, and the like. S. Karika, p.\n148, 151. In place of Badha, however, the more usual reading, as in the\nBhagavata, Varaha, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81as, is Vidha, \'kind,\' \'sort,\' as\n###, implying twenty-eight sorts of animals. These are thus specified in the\nBhagavata, III. 10: Six kinds have single hoofs, nine have double or cloven\nhoofs, and thirteen have five claws or nails instead of hoofs. The first are\nthe horse, the mule, the ass, the yak, the sarabha, and the gaura, or white\ndeer. The second are the cow, the goat, the buffalo, the hog, the gayal, the\nblack deer, the antelope, the camel, and the sheep. The last are the dog,\nshacal, wolf, tiger, cat, hare, porcupine, lion, monkey, elephant, tortoise,\nlizard, and alligator.\n\n[36:6](vp039.htm#fr_172) \xc3\x9arddha, \'above,\' and Srotas, as before; their\nnourishment being derived from the exterior, not from the interior of the\nbody: according to the commentator; ### as a text of the Vedas has it;\n\'Through satiety derived from even beholding ambrosia.\'\n\n[36:7](vp039.htm#fr_173) Arvak, \'downwards,\' and Srotas, \'canal.\'\n\n[36:8](vp039.htm#fr_174) This reckoning is not very easily reconciled with the\ncreations described; for, as presently enumerated, the stages of creation are\nseven. The commentator, however, considers the \xc3\x9arddhasrotas creation, or that\nof the superhuman beings, to be the same with that of the Indriyas, or senses\nover which they preside; by which the number is reduced to six.\n\n[36:9](vp039.htm#fr_175) This creation being the work of the supreme spirit,\n### according to the commentator; or it might have been understood to mean,\nthat Brahma was then created, being, as we have seen, identified with Mahat,\n\'active intelligence,\' or the operating will of the Supreme. See [p.\n15](vp036.htm#page_15), note [23](vp036.htm#fn_136).\n\n[37:10](vp039.htm#fr_176) The text is, ### which is, as rendered in the text,\n\'creation preceded by, or beginning with Buddhi, intelligence.\' The rules of\neuphony would however admit of a mute negative being inserted, or \'preceded by\nignorance;\' that is, by the chief principle, crude nature or Pradhana, which\nis one with ignorance: but this seems to depend on notions of a later date,\nand more partial adoption, than those generally prevailing in our authority;\nand the first reading therefore has been preferred. It is also to be observed,\nthat the first unintellectual creation was that of immovable objects (as in p.\n35), the original of which is, ### and all ambiguity of construction is\navoided. The reading is also established by the text of the Linga Puran\xcc\x81a,\nwhich enumerates the different series of creation in the words of the Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nexcept in this passage, which is there transposed, with a slight variation of\nthe reading. Instead of ### it is ### \'The first creation was that of Mahat:\nIntellect being the first in manifestation.\' The reading of the Vayu P. is\nstill more tautological, but confirms that here preferred: See also n. 12.\n\n[37:11](vp039.htm#fr_177) The Anugraha creation, of which no notice has been\nfound in the Mahabharata, seems to have been borrowed from the Sankhya\nphilosophy. It is more particularly described in the Padma, Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya,\nLinga, and Matsya Puran\xcc\x81as; as, \'The fifth is the Anugraha creation, which is\nsubdivided into four kinds; by obstruction, disability, perfectness, and\nacquiescence.\' This is the Pratyaya sarga, or intellectual creation, of the\nSankhyas (S. Karika, v. 46. p.146); the creation of which we have a notion, or\nto which we give assent (Anugraha), in contradistinction to organic creation,\nor that existence of which we have sensible perception. In its specific\nsubdivisions it is the notion of certain inseparable properties in the four\ndifferent orders of beings: obstruction or stolidity in inanimate things;\ninability or imperfection in animals; perfectibility in man; and acquiescence\nor tranquil enjoyment in gods. So also the Vayu P.: ###\n\n[37:12](vp039.htm#fr_178) Or Vaikrita, derived mediately from the first\nprinciple, through its Vikritis, \'productions\' or \'developements;\' and\nPrakrita, derived more immediately from the chief principle itself. Mahat and\nthe two forms of Ahankara, or the rudimental elements and the senses,\nconstitute the latter class; inanimate beings, &c. compose the former: or the\nlatter are considered as the work of p. 38 Brahma, whilst the three first are\nevolved from Pradhana. So the Vayu: \'The three creations beginning with\nIntelligence are elemental; but the six creations which proceed from the\nseries of which Intellect is the first are the work of Brahma\'.\n\n[38:13](vp039.htm#fr_179) We must have recourse here also to other Puran\xcc\x81as,\nfor the elucidation of this term. The Kaumara creation is the creation of\nRudra or Nilalohita, a form of \xc5\x9aiva, by Brahma, which is subsequently\ndescribed in our text, and of certain other mind-born sons of Brahma, of whose\nbirth the Vishn\xcc\x81u P. gives no further account: they are elsewhere termed\nSanatkumara, Sananda, Sanaka, and Sanatana, with sometimes a fifth, Ribhu,\nadded. These, declining to create progeny, remained, as the name of the first\nimplies, ever boys, kumaras; that is, ever pure and innocent; whence their\ncreation is called the Kaumara. Thus the Vayu: ###. And the Linga has, \'Being\never as he was born, he is here called a youth; and hence his name is well\nknown as Sanatkumara.\' This authority makes Sanatkumara and Ribhu the two\nfirst born of all, whilst the text of the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba limits the primogeniture\nto Sanatkumara. In another place, however, it enumerates apparently six, or\nthe above four with Sana and either. Ribhu or another Sanatana; for the\npassage is corrupt. The French translation ascribes a share in creation to\nSanatkumara: \'Les sept Prajapatis, Roudra, Scanda, et Sanatkaumara, se mirent\na produire les etres repandant partout l\'inepuisable energie de dieu.\' The\noriginal is, Sankshipya is not \'repandant,\' but \'restraining;\' and Tisht\xcc\x81hatah\nbeing in the dual number, relates of course to only two of the series. The\ncorrect rendering is, \'These seven (Prajapatis) created progeny, and so did\nRudra; but Skanda and Sanatkumara, restraining their power, abstained (from\ncreation).\' So the commentator: ###. These sages, however, live as long as\nBrahma, and they are only created by him in the first Kalpa, although their\ngeneration is very commonly, but inconsistently, introduced in the Varaha or\nPadma Kalpas. This creation, says the text, is both primary (Prakrita) and\nsecondary (Vaikrita). It is the latter, according to the commentator, as\nregards the origin of these saints from Brahma: it is the former as affects\nRudra, who, though proceeding from Brahma, in a certain form was in essence\nequally an immediate production of the first principle. These notions, the\nbirth of Rudra and the saints, seem to have been borrowed from the Saivas, and\nto have been awkwardly engrafted upon the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava system. Sanatkumara and\nhis brethren are always described in the Saiva Puran\xcc\x81as as Yogis: as the\nKurma, after enumerating them, adds, \'These five, oh Brahmans, were Yogis, p.\n39 who acquired entire exemption from passion:\' and the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, although\nrather Vaishn\xcc\x81ava than Saiva, observes, that the Yogis celebrate these six,\nalong with Kapila, in Yoga works. The idea seems to have been amplified also\nin the Saiva works; for the Linga P. describes the repeated birth of \xc5\x9aiva, or\nVamadeva, as a Kumara, or boy, from Brahma, in each Kalpa, who again becomes\nfour. Thus in the twenty-ninth Kalpa Swetalohita is the Kumara, and he becomes\nSananda, Nandana, Viswananda, Upanandana; all of a white complexion: in the\nthirtieth the Kumara becomes Virajas, Vivahu, Visoka, Viswabhavana; all of a\nred colour: in the thirty-first he becomes four youths of a yellow colour: and\nin the thirty-second the four Kumaras were black. All these are, no doubt,\ncomparatively recent additions to the original notion of the birth of Rudra\nand the Kumaras; itself obviously a sectarial innovation upon the primitive\ndoctrine of the birth of the Prajapatis, or will-born sons of Brahma.\n\n[39:14](vp039.htm#fr_180) These reiterated, and not always very congruous\naccounts of the creation are explained by the Puran\xcc\x81as as referring to\ndifferent Kalpas, or renovations of the world, and therefore involving no\nincompatibility. A better reason for their appearance is the probability that\nthey have been borrowed from different original authorities. The account that\nfollows is evidently modified by the Yogi Saivas, by its general mysticism,\nand by the expressions with which it begins: \'Collecting his mind into\nitself,\' according to the comment, is the performance of the Yoga (Yuyuje).\nThe term Ambhansi, lit. \'waters,\' for the four orders of beings, gods, demons,\nmen, and Pitris, is also a peculiar, and probably mystic term. The commentator\nsays it occurs in the Vedas as a synonyme of gods. The Vayu Puran\xcc\x81a derives it\nfrom \'to shine,\' p. 40 because the different orders of beings shine or\nflourish severally by moonlight, night, day, and twilight: &c.\n\n[40:15](vp039.htm#fr_181) This account is given in several other Puran\xcc\x81as: in\nthe Kurma with more simplicity; in the Padma, Linga, and Vayu with more\ndetail. The Bhagavata, as usual, amplifies still more copiously, and mixes up\nmuch absurdity with the account. Thus the person of Sandhya, \'evening\ntwilight,\' is thus described: "She appeared with eyes rolling with passion,\nwhilst her lotus-like feet sounded with tinkling ornaments: a muslin vest\ndepended from her waist, secured by a golden zone: her breasts were\nprotuberant, and close together; her nose was elegant; her tongue beautiful;\nher face was bright with smiles, and she modestly concealed it with the skirts\nof her robe; whilst the dark curls clustered round her brow." The Asuras\naddress her, and win her to become their bride. To the four forms of our text,\nthe same work adds, Tandri, \'sloth;\' Jrimbhika, \'yawning;\' Nidra, \'sleep;\'\nUnmada, \'insanity;\' Antarddhana, \'disappearance;\' Pratibimba, \'reflexion;\'\nwhich become the property of Pisachas, Kinnaras, Bhutas, Gandherbas,\nVidyadharas, Sadhyas, Pitris, and Menus. The notions of night, day, twilight,\nand moonlight being derived from Brahma, seem to have originated with the\nVedas. Thus the commentator on the Bhagavata p. 41 observes, \'That which was\nhis body, and was left, was darkness: this is the \xc5\x9aruti.\' All the authorities\nplace night before day, and the Asuras or Titans before the gods, in the order\nof appearance; as did Hesiod and other ancient theogonists.\n\n[41:16](vp039.htm#fr_182) From Raksha, \'to preserve\'\n\n[41:17](vp039.htm#fr_183) From Yaksha, \'to eat\'\n\n[41:18](vp039.htm#fr_184) From Srip, serpo, \'to creep,\' and from Ha, \'to\nabandon.\'\n\n[41:19](vp039.htm#fr_185) Gam dhayantah, \'drinking speech.\'\n\n[41:20](vp039.htm#fr_186) This and the preceding enumeration p. 42 of the\norigin of vegetables and animals occurs in several Puran\xcc\x81as, precisely in the\nsame words. The Linga adds a specification of the Aranya, or wild animals,\nwhich are said to be the buffalo, gayal, bear, monkey, sarabha, wolf, and\nlion.\n\n[42:21](vp039.htm#fr_187) This specification of the parts of the Vedas that\nproceed from Brahma occurs, in the same words, in the Vayu, Linga, Kurma,\nPadma, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81as. The Bhagavata offers some important\nvarieties: "From his eastern and other mouths he created the Rich, Yajush,\nSama, and Atharvan vedas; the \xc5\x9aastra, or \'the unuttered incantation;\' Ijya,\n\'oblation;\' Stuti and Stoma, \'prayers\' and \'hymns;\' and Praya\xc5\x9bchitta,\n\'expiation\' or \'sacred philosophy\' (Brahma): also the Vedas of medicine, arms,\nmusic, and mechanics; and the Itihasas and Puran\xcc\x81as, which are a fifth Veda:\nalso the portions of the Vedas called Sorasi, Uktha, Purishi, \'Agnisht\xcc\x81ut,\n\xc3\x81ptoryama, Atiratra, Vajapeya, Gosava; the four parts of virtue, purity,\nliberality, piety, and truth; the orders of life, and their institutes and\ndifferent religious rites and professions; and the sciences of logic, ethics,\nand polity. The mystic words and monosyllable proceeded from his heart; the\nmetre Ushnih from the hairs of his body; Gayatri from his skin; Trisht\xcc\x81ubh\nfrom his flesh; Anusht\xcc\x81ubh from his tendons; Jagati from his bones; Pankti\nfrom his marrow; Vrihati from his breath. The consonants were his life; the\nvowels his body; the sibilants his senses; the semivowels his vigour." This\nmysticism, although perhaps expanded and amplified by the Pauran\xcc\x81ics, appears\nto originate with the Vedas: as in the text, \'The metre was of the tendons.\'\nThe different portions of the Vedas specified in the text are yet, for the\nmost part, uninvestigated.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VI](vp040.htm)\n\n'
