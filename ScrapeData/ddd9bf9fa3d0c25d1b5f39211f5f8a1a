Upon this, Nund\'s wife also took a large\nsized new dish, placing it upon a stand, and spreading a seat for herself;\nwith churning staff and string, she sat down, and began to churn for Shree\nKrishnu, after having arranged fresh, unused vessels for holding the milk. At\nthis time, the sound made by churning in Nund\'s house was like thunder. In the\nmean while, Krishnu awoke, and began crying, and calling out for his mother.\nWhen no one heeded his calling out, he came himself to Jusodha, and with tears\nin his eyes, in a state of agitation, sobbing and lisping, began to say,\n"Mother! how often have I called for you, and you have not come to give me\nvictuals; is your business not finished yet?" Saying this, he became cross.\n\nHaving taken the churning staff from the large dish, putting both his hands\ninto it, and taking out the butter, he began to throw it about, and besmear\nhis body with it; and kicking about his feet, and laying hold of his dress, he\nbegan to cry.\n\np. 43\n\nThen Nund\'s wife, being frightened and angry, said, "Son! what have you done?"\nor "what sort of behaviour is this? Get up, and come along with me, and I will\ngive you food," Krishnu said, "I will not take any now; why did you not give\nit me at first, mother? For me to take it now would be a calamity." At length,\nwith coaxing and kindness, Jusodha kissed him, and took him in her lap, and\ngave him thick milk, and bread and butter to eat. Huri laughed and ate; Nund\'s\nwife, placing a cloth over him in such a way that no one could see him,\ncontinued to feed him.\n\nIn the mean while a cowherdess cane, and said, "You are sitting here, while\nthere all the milk has boiled over the fireplace." On hearing this, having\nquickly put down Krishnu from her lap, she ran off, and went and saved the\nmilk; Whilst Krishnu, having broken the vessels, containing the curds and\nbuttermilk, destroyed the churning staves; and having taken a small earthen\npot, filled with butter, ran off to the cowherds\' children. He found a wooden\nmortar, placed upside down, upon which he sat, and having seated his\ncompanions on four sides, they began to distribute the butter to each other\nlaughing, and to eat it.\n\nWhen Jusodha came back, after having taken off the milk from the fire-place,\nshe saw that the courtyard and hall were greasy with curds and buttermilk.\nReflecting, and considering upon this, she came forth with a stick in her\nhand; and searching about, came to the spot where Shree Krishnu had formed an\nassembly, and was eating and distributing butter. When she went behind, and\nplaced her hand on him, Huri, seeing his mother, crying and entreating, said\nto her, "Mother! I do not know who caused the buttermilk to be spilt; let go\nof me." Hearing him speak with so much humility, Jusodha, laughing and\nthrowing away the stick, embraced Krishnu with the greatest delight, though\npretending to be angry; and having brought him home, began to fasten him to\nthe wooden mortar. Shree Krishnu contrived, that whatever string she\n\np. 44\n\nfastened him with, should be too short. Jusodha sent for all the strings in\nthe house; but nevertheless, Krishnu was not fastened--At length perceiving\nthat his mother was vexed, he allowed himself to be bound. Nund\'s wife having\nfastened him, and having exacted an oath from the cowherdesses, that they\nwould not let him loose, began to occupy herself with domestic matters.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI](psa12.htm)\n\n'
