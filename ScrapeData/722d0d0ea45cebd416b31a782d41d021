Hence,\nperhaps, the myth.\n\n[50:1b](ry040.htm#fr_183) The region here spoken of is called in the Laws of\nManu _Madhyades'a_ or the middle region. 'The region situated between the\nHimalaya and the Vindhya Mountains ... is called _Madhyades'a_ , or the middle\nregion; the space comprised between these two mountains from the eastern to\nthe western sea is called by sages \xc3\x81ryavartta, _the seat of honourable men_.'\n(MANU, II, 21, 22.) The Sanskrit Indians called themselves \xc3\x81ryans, which means\n_honourable, noble_ , to distinguish themselves from the surrounding nations\nof different origin.'
