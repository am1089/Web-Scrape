Thus also, on account of the existence of the former (qualities),\n(admitted) owing to reference and so on, there is absence of contradiction,\n(as) Badaraya _n_ a (thinks).\n\nThus also, i.e. although it be admitted that intelligence only constitutes the\ntrue nature of the Self, also the former nature, i.e. lordly power like that\nof Brahman, which is intimated by reference and the rest, is--with a view to\nthe world of appearances--not rejected; and hence there is no contradiction.\nThis is the opinion of the teacher Badaraya _n_ a.\n\n8\\. But by mere will (the released effect their purposes); because scripture\nstates that.\n\nIn the meditation on Brahman within the heart we read as follows: 'If he\ndesires the world of the fathers, by his mere will the fathers rise,' &c. (\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 2, 1).--A doubt here presents itself whether the will alone is\nthe cause of the rising of the fathers, or the will joined with some other\noperative cause.--The purvapakshin maintains that although scripture says 'by\nhis mere will,' some other cause must be supposed to co-operate, as in\nordinary life. For as in our ordinary experience the meeting with one's father\nis caused by one's will, and, in addition, by the act of going and so on, so\nit will be in the case of the released soul also; and\n\np. 411\n\nthus we do not assume something contrary to observation. When the text says\n'by his mere will,' it implies, as in the case of a king, the whole apparatus\nof other easily procurable instrumental causes by which the desired object is\nobtained. Besides, if the fathers and so on rose owing to a mere wish, they\nwould be of unstable nature, like the imaginary representation of some desired\nobject, and thus not be able to procure any solid enjoyment.--To this we reply\nthat the rising of the fathers and so on is due to the will only.--Why so?--\nBecause scripture declares this. If any other cause were required, the direct\nscriptural statement 'by his will only' would thereby be contradicted. And\neven if we admit some other cause accompanying the act of will, it cannot be a\ncause to be realised by an effort; for therefrom it would follow that before\nthe realisation of that cause the will would be barren. Nor can the analogies\nof ordinary experience be applied to something to be learned from scripture.\nFor as the will of the released differs in nature from the will of ordinary\nmen, it may have the power of effecting something that possesses as much\nstability as the special purpose requires.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 9](sbe38325.htm)\n\n"
