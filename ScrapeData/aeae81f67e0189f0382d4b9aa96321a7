And there is non-difference (of the intention of Brahman's distinguishing\nattributes), as in the case of light; and the light (is) intuited as\nconstituting Brahman's essential nature by repetition of the practice (of\nmeditation).\n\nThat the clause 'not so' negatives not Brahman's possessing two forms, a\nmaterial and an immaterial one, but only Brahman's nature being restricted to\nthose determinations, follows therefrom also that in the vision of Vamadeva\nand others who had attained to intuition into Brahman's nature, the fact of\nBrahman having all material and immaterial beings for its attributes is\napprehended in non-difference, i.e. in the same way as the fact of light (i.e.\nknowledge) and bliss constituting Brahman's essential nature. Compare the text\n'Seeing this the _Ri_ shi Vamadeva understood, I am Manu and the sun' (B _ri_.\nUp. I, 4, 10). And that light and bliss constitute Brahman's nature was\nperceived by Vamadeva and the rest through repeated performance of the\npractice of devout meditation.
