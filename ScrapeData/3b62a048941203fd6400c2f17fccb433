There is interchange (of ideas), for the texts distinguish; as in other\ncases.\n\nThere is no difference of vidya because both questions and answers have one\nsubject-matter, and because the one word that possesses enjoining power proves\nthe connexion of the two sections. Both questions have for their topic Brahman\nviewed as the inner Self of all; and in the second question the word 'eva'\n('just,' 'very') in 'Tell me just that Brahman,' &c., proves that the question\nof Kahola has for its subject the Brahman, to the qualities of which the\nquestion of Ushasta had referred. Both answers again refer to the one Brahman,\nviewed as the Self of all. The idea of the injunction of the entire meditation\nagain is suggested in the second section only, 'Therefore a Brahma _n_ a,\nafter he has done with learning, is to wish to stand by real strength.' The\nobject of meditation being thus ascertained to be one, there must be effected\na mutual interchange of the ideas of Ushasta and Kahola, i.e. Ushasta's\nconception of Brahman being the cause of all life must be entertained by the\ninterrogating Kahola also; and vice versa the conception of Kahola as to\nBrahman being beyond hunger,\n\np. 658\n\nthirst, and so on, must be entertained by Ushasta also. This interchange being\nmade, the difference of Brahman, the inner Self of all, from the individual\nsoul is determined by both sections. For this is the very object of Ya _g\n\xc3\xb1_avalkya's replies: in order to intimate that the inner Self of all is\ndifferent from the individual soul, they distinguish that Self as the cause of\nall life and as raised above hunger, thirst, and so on. Hence Brahman's being\nthe inner Self of all is the only quality that is the subject of meditation;\nthat it is the cause of life and so on are only means to prove its being such,\nand are not therefore to be meditated on independently.--But if this is so, to\nwhat end must there be made an interchange, on the part of the two\ninterrogators, of their respective ideas?--Brahman having, on the ground of\nbeing the cause of all life, been ascertained by Ushasta as the inner Self of\nall, and different from the individual soul, Kahola renews the question,\nthinking that the inner Self of all must be viewed as different from the soul,\non the ground of some special attribute which cannot possibly belong to the\nsoul; and Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya divining his thought thereon declares that the inner\nSelf possesses an attribute which cannot possibly belong to the soul, viz.\nbeing in essential opposition to all imperfection. The interchange of ideas\ntherefore has to be made for the purpose of establishing the idea of the\nindividual nature of the object of meditation.--'As elsewhere,' i.e. as in the\ncase of the knowledge of that which truly is, the repeated questions and\nreplies only serve to define one and the same Brahman, not to convey the idea\nof the object of meditation having to be meditated on under new aspects.--But\na new objection is raised--As there is, in the Sad-vidya also, a difference\nbetween the several questions and answers, how is that vidya known to be one?\n--To this question the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 37.
