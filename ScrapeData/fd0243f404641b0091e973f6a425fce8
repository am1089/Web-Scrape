Since there may be manifestation of that which exists; as in the case of\nvirile power and so on.\n\nThe 'but' is meant to set the raised objection aside. The case may be that\nwhile consciousness is present also in deep sleep, and so on, it is manifested\nin the waking state only; whence there would be no objection to viewing\nconsciousness as an essential attribute of the Self. 'As in the case of virile\npower and the like.' Special substances such as the virile element are indeed\npresent in the male child already, but then are not manifest, while later on\nthey manifest themselves with advancing youth; but all the same the possession\nof those substances is essential to the male being, not merely adventitious.\nFor to be made up of seven elementary substances (viz. blood, humour, flesh,\nfat, marrow, bone, and semen) is an essential, property of the body. That even\nin deep sleep and similar states the 'I' shines forth we have explained above.\nConsciousness is always there, but only in the waking state and in dreams it\nis observed to relate itself to objects. And that to be a subject of\ncognition, and so on, are essential attributes of the Self, we have also\nproved before. The conclusion, therefore, is that to be a knowing subject is\nthe essential character of the Self. And that Self is of atomic size. The text\n'when he has departed there is no consciousness' (sa _mg \xc3\xb1_a; B _ri._ Up. II,\n4, 12) does not declare that the released Self has no consciousness; but only\nthat in the case of that Self there is absent that knowledge (experience) of\nbirth, death, and so on, which in the Sa _m_ sara state is caused by the\nconnexion of the Self with the elements- as described in the preceding\npassage, 'that great being having risen from out these elements again perishes\nafter them.' For the text as to the absence of sa _mg \xc3\xb1_a after death must be\ninterpreted in harmony with other texts describing the condition of the\nreleased soul, such as 'the seeing one does not see death nor illness nor\npain; the seeing one sees everything and obtains everything everywhere' (\n_Kh._ Up. VII, 25, 2); 'not remembering that body\n\np. 552\n\ninto which he was born--seeing these pleasures with the mind he rejoices'\n(VIII, 12, 3; 5).\n\nThe Sutras now proceed to refute the doctrine of the Self being (not a knower)\nbut mere knowledge, and being omnipresent.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 32.
