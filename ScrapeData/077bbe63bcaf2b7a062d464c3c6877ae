And on account of both (i.e. the origin and the dissolution of the world)\nbeing directly declared (to have Brahman for their material cause).\n\nThis Sutra supplies a further argument for Brahman's\n\np. 287\n\nbeing the general material cause.--Brahman is the material cause of the world\nfor that reason also that the origination as well as the dissolution of the\nworld is directly spoken of in the sacred texts as having Brahman for their\nmaterial cause, 'All these beings take their rise from the ether and return\ninto the ether' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 9, 1). That that from which some other thing\nsprings and into which it returns is the material cause of that other thing is\nwell known. Thus the earth, for instance, is the material cause of rice,\nbarley, and the like.--The word 'directly' (in the Sutra) notifies that there\nis no other material cause, but that all this sprang from the ether only.--\nObservation further teaches that effects are not re-absorbed into anything\nelse but their material causes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 26](sbe34137.htm)\n\n"
