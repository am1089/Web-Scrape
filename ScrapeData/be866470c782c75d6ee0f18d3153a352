Indra-Agni, in consequence of our prayers come hither to the pressed\n(Soma), to the precious cloud [1](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:1:1). Drink of it\nincited by our thoughts (i. e. by our prayers).\n\n2\\. Indra-Agni, the brilliant [1](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:2:1) sacrifice of him\nwho praises you goes forward together (with the Soma libations, the praises,\n&c.). Thus drink this pressed (Soma)!\n\n3\\. By this stirring sacrifice I choose Indra and Agni who show themselves as\nsages [1](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:3:1); may they here satiate themselves with\nSoma.\n\n4\\. I call the bounteous [1](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:4:1), the killers of foes\n[2](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:4:2), the united conquerors, unconquered, Indra-Agni,\nthe greatest winners of booty.\n\n5\\. The praisers rich in hymns, knowing all the ways (of the sacrifice), laud\nyou. Indra-Agni, I choose the food (which you give).\n\n6\\. Indra-Agni, you have hurled down by one deed the ninety strongholds\ntogether of which the Dasas were the lords.\n\n7\\. Indra-Agni, the thoughts (of the worshippers) go forward towards (you)\nfrom the work (of sacrifice) along the paths of _Ri_ ta.\n\n8\\. Indra and Agni, yours are powerful abodes and delights. You cross the\nwaters: this is the deed which belongs to you [1](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:8:1).\n\n9\\. Indra and Agni, you display the lights of heaven in your deeds of\nstrength; that mighty deed of yours has been known far and wide.\n\np. 264\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre. The hymn is addressed to the couple Indra and\nAgni.--Verses 1-3 = SV. II, 19-21\\. Verse 1 = VS. VII, 31; TS. I, 4, 15, 1;\nMS. I, 3, 17. Verses 4-6 = SV. II, 1052-1054\\. Verses 5-8 = SV. II, 925-928\\.\nVerse 5 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 6 = TS. I, 1, 14, 1; MS. IV, 10, 5. Verses 9,\n7, 8 = SV. II, 1044-1045\\. Verse 9 = TS. IV, 2, 11, 1; 3, 13, 8; TB. III, 5,\n7, 3; MS. IV, 10, 4; 11, 1.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. 'Cloud,' of course, means that which comes from the cloud. In the Soma\nhymns of the ninth Ma _n_ _d_ ala, the word nabha _h_ seems frequently to\nrefer to the water with which the Soma is mixed (see IX, 69, 5; 71, 1. 3; 74,\n4; 83, 5; 86, 14; 97, 21; Prof. Hillebrandt's opinion on these passages is\ndifferent, see his Vedische Mythologie, I, 212). Perhaps we should go too far\nin believing that in our verse the poet invited the gods to come and drink\nthat water, but possibly the mixture of water and of the juice of the Soma\nplant descending from heaven and nourished by the heavenly waters represented\nitself to the poet's mind as something coming from, and thus being identical\nwith, the cloud.\n\n##### Verse 2\n\nNote 1. On _k_ etana _h_ , Prof. Max Muller remarks, 'perhaps which appeals to\nyou \xe2\x80\xa6 so that they take note of it.'\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. There may be doubts about kavi _k_ _kh_ ada. Prof. Max Muller remarks,\n'is it, wishing for sages?' I think that my translation is recommended by X,\n81, 1. prathama _k_ _kh_ at.\n\np. 265\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Comp. I, 169, 5. ra\xc2\xb4ya _h_ to _s_ atama _h_ ; VIII, 38, 2. to _s_ a\xc2\xb4sa\nrathaya\xc2\xb4vana \xe2\x80\xa6 indragni, and Brugmann in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXIV, 24.\n\nNote 2. Or, the killers of V _ri_ tra.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. On aptur and aptu\xc2\xb4rya, comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 122 seq.,\nand H.
