Fire (is produced) thence (i.e. from air); for thus (the text) declares.\n\nIn the _Kh_ andogya it is said that fire has for its source that which is\n(Brahman), in the Taittiriyaka that it has the air for its source. There being\nthus a conflict of scriptural passages with regard to the origin of fire, the\npurvapakshin maintains that fire has Brahman for its source.--Why?--Because\nthe text, after having stated at the outset that there existed only that which\nis, teaches that it sent forth fire; and because the assertion of everything\nbeing known through Brahman is possible only in case of everything;\n\np. 21\n\nbeing produced from Brahman; and because the scriptural statement as to the\n'Ta _g_ _g_ alan' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 1) specifies no difference 1; and\nbecause another scriptural passage (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3) teaches that everything\nwithout exception is born from Brahman. The Taittiriyaka also makes a\nstatement about the entire world without any exception, 'after having brooded\nhe sent forth all whatever there is' (Taitt. Up. II, 6). Hence the statement\nthat 'fire was produced from air' (Taitt. Up. II, 1) must be considered to\nteach the order of succession only 'fire was produced subsequently to air.'\n\nTo this the Sutra replies that fire was produced thence, i.e. from air,\nbecause the text declares it to be so--'from air sprang fire.' For if fire had\nsprung directly from Brahman and not from air, the scriptural statement that\n'fire sprang from air' would be contradicted thereby. That that statement\nshould intimate the order of succession merely, as maintained by the\npurvapakshin, we cannot admit. For as in the preceding sentence ('from that\nSelf sprang ether') the fifth case (atmana _h_ ) denotes the Self as that from\nwhich the origination proceeds, and as the same verb sprang') governs our\nsentence also, and as in the following sentences also--such as 'from earth the\nherbs'--the fifth case (p _ri_ thivya _h_ ) denotes that from which something\nproceeds we understand that in our sentence also the fifth case (vayo _h_ )\ndenotes that from which fire proceeds. Moreover, if we should explain our\nsentence to mean 'after air fire was produced,' we should have to supply some\npreposition (or adverb as 'after,' 'subsequently'), while that construction\nwhich rests on the proper sense of the fifth case-affix is ready made at hand\nand does not require anything to be applied. The passage therefore intimates\nthat fire springs from air.--But, it may be said, the other scriptural passage\n('sent forth fire') intimates that fire springs from Brahman. Not so, we\nreply; for this latter passage remains uncontradicted, even if we assume that\nfire sprang from Brahman only through intermediate links (not directly).\n\np. 22\n\nEven the supposition that Brahman, after having created ether and air, assumed\nthe form of air and thus created fire would not be opposed to fire having\nsprung from Brahman; for we may say equally that milk comes from the cow, that\ncurds come from the cow, that cheese comes from the cow. There is, moreover, a\nscriptural passage declaring that Brahman abides as the Self of its effects,\nviz. Taitt Up. II, 7, 'That made itself its Self.' And analogously Sm _ri_ ti\n--in the passage beginning 'Cognition, knowledge, steadiness of mind' (Bha.\nGi. X, 4)--says about the Lord, 'From me only spring the manifold states of\nthe beings.' For although cognition and so on are observed to spring directly\nfrom their immediate causes, yet (the assertion made in the passage quoted\nholds good), since the entire aggregate of beings is, directly or indirectly,\nderived from the Lord.--Thereby those scriptural passages are accounted for\nwhich speak of the creation (on the whole) without specifying the order of\nsuccession 1; for they may be explained anyhow, while on the other hand the\npassages specifying the order of creation cannot be turned in any other way\n(i.e. not away from their direct sense). The general assertion, moreover, of\neverything springing from Brahman requires only that all things should\nultimately proceed from that which is, not that they should be its immediate\neffects.--Thus there remains no difficulty.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[21:1](sbe38011.htm#fr_18) But implies the whole world to have sprung from\nBrahman.\n\n[22:1](sbe38011.htm#fr_19) I.e. it appears from the preceding discussion that\nthose passages have to be explained in such a way as to agree with those other\npassages which state the order of the created beings.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 11](sbe38012.htm)\n\n"
