The notes will necessarily have to be\nreduced to smaller dimensions, but they must always constitute the more\nimportant part in a translation or, more truly, in a deciphering of Vedic\nhymns.'\n\nThis was written more than twenty years ago, but though since that time Vedic\nscholarship has advanced with giant steps, I still hold exactly the same\nopinion which I held then with regard to the principles that ought to be\nfollowed by the first translators of the Veda. I hold that they ought to be\ndecipherers, and that they are bound to justify every word of their\ntranslation in exactly the same manner in which the decipherers of\nhieroglyphic or cuneiform inscriptions justify every step they take. I\ntherefore called my translation the first traduction raisonnee. I took as an\nexample which I tried to follow, though well aware of my inability to reach\nits excellence, the Commentaire sur le Yasna by my friend and teacher, Eugene\nBurnouf. Burnouf considered a commentary of 940 pages quarto as by no means\nexcessive for a thorough interpretation of the firs; chapter of the\nZoroastrian Veda, and only those unacquainted with the real difficulties of\nthe Rig-veda would venture to say that its ancient words and thoughts required\na less painstaking elucidation than those of the Avesta. In spite of all that\nhas been said and written to the contrary, and with every wish to learn from\nthose who think that the difficulties of a translation of Vedic hymns have\nbeen unduly exaggerated by me, I cannot in the least\n\np. x\n\nmodify what I said twenty, or rather forty years ago, that a mere translation\nof the Veda, however accurate, intelligible, poetical, and even beautiful, is\nof absolutely no value for the advancement of Vedic scholarship, unless it is\nfollowed by pieces justificatives, that is, unless the translator gives his\nreasons why he has translated every word about which there can be any doubt,\nin his own way, and not in any other.\n\nIt is well known that Professor von Roth, one of our most eminent Vedic\nscholars, holds the very opposite opinion. He declares that a metrical\ntranslation is the best commentary, and that if he could ever think of a\ntranslation of the Rig-veda, he would throw the chief weight, not on the\nnotes, but on the translation of the text. 'A translation,' he writes, 'must\nspeak for itself. As a rule, it only requires a commentary where it is not\ndirectly convincing, and where the translator does not feel secure.'\n\nBetween opinions so diametrically opposed, no compromise seems possible, and\nyet I feel convinced that when we come to discuss any controverted passage,\nProfessor von Roth will have to adopt exactly the same principles of\ntranslation which I have followed.\n\nOn one point, however, I am quite willing to agree with my adversaries,\nnamely, that a metrical rendering would convey a truer idea of the hymns of\nthe Vedic _Ri_ shis than a prose rendering. When I had to translate Vedic\nhymns into German, I have generally, if not always, endeavoured to clothe them\nin a metrical form. In English I feel unable to do so, but I have no doubt\nthat future scholars will find it possible to add rhythm and even rhyme, after\nthe true meaning of the ancient verses has once been determined. But even with\nregard to my German metrical translations, I feel in honesty bound to confess\nthat a metrical translation is often an excuse only for an inaccurate\ntranslation. If we could make sure of a translator like Ruckert, even the\nimpossible might become possible. But as there are few, if any, who, like him,\nare great alike as scholars and poets, the mere scholar seems to me to be\ndoing his duty better when he produces a correct translation, though in\n\np. xi\n\nprose, than if he has to make any concessions, however small, on the side of\nfaithfulness in favour of rhythm and rhyme.\n\nIf a metrical, an intelligible, and, generally speaking, a beautiful\ntranslation were all we wanted, why should so many scholars clamour for a new\ntranslation, when they have that by Grassmann? It rests on Bohtlingk and\nRoth's Dictionary, or represents, as we are told, even a more advanced stage\nof Vedic scholarship. Yet after the well-known contributors of certain\ncritical Journals had repeated ever so many times all that could possibly be\nsaid in praise of Grassmann's, and in dispraise of Ludwig's translation, what\nis the result? Grassmann's metrical translation, the merits of which,\nconsidering the time when it was published, I have never been loth to\nacknowledge, is hardly ever appealed to, while Ludwig's prose rendering, with\nall its drawbacks, is universally considered as the only scholarlike\ntranslation of the Rig-veda now in existence. Time tries the troth in\neverything.\n\nThere is another point also on which I am quite willing to admit that my\nadversaries are right. 'No one who knows anything about the Veda,' they say,\n'would think of attempting a translation of it at present. A translation of\nthe Rig-veda is a task for the next century.' No one feels this more strongly\nthan I do; no one has been more unwilling to make even a beginning in this\narduous undertaking. Yet a beginning has to be made. We have to advance step\nby step, nay, inch by inch, if we ever hope to make a breach in that\napparently impregnable fortress. If by translation we mean a complete,\nsatisfactory, and final translation of the whole of the Rig-veda, I should\nfeel inclined to go even further than Professor von Roth. Not only shall we\nhave to wait till the next century for such a work, but I doubt whether we\nshall ever obtain it. In some cases the text is so corrupt that no conjectural\ncriticism will restore, no power of divination interpret it. In other cases,\nverses and phrases seem to have been jumbled together by later writers in the\nmost thoughtless manner. My principle therefore has always been, Let us\ntranslate what we can, and thus reduce the untranslateable\n\np. xii\n\nportion to narrower and narrower limits. But in doing this we ought not to be\ntoo proud to take our friends, and even our adversaries, into our confidence.\nA translation on the sic volo sic jubeo principle does far more harm than\ngood. It may be true that a judge, if he is wise, will deliver his judgment,\nbut never propound his reasons. But a scholar is a pleader rather than a\njudge, and he is in duty bound to propound his reasons.\n\nIn order to make the difference between Professor von Roth's translations and\nmy own quite clear, I readily accept the text which he has himself chosen. He\ntook one of the hymns which I had translated with notes (the 165th hymn of the\nfirst Ma _n_ _d_ ala), and translated it himself metrically, in order to show\nus what, according to him, a really perfect translation ought to be a. Let us\nthen compare the results.\n\nOn many points Professor von Roth adopts the same renderings which I had\nadopted, only that he gives no reasons, while I do so, at least for all\ndebatable passages. First of all, I had tried to prove that the two verses in\nthe beginning, which the Anukrama _n_ i ascribes to Indra, should be ascribed\nto the poet. Professor von Roth takes the same view, but for the rest of the\nhymn adopts, like myself, that distribution of the verses among the singer,\nthe Maruts, and Indra which the Anukrama _n_ i suggests. I mention this\nbecause Ludwig has defended the view of the author of the Anukrama _n_ i with\nvery strong arguments. He quotes from the Taitt. Br. II, 7, 11, and from the\nTa _n_ _d_ ya Br. XXI, 14, 5, the old legend that Agastya made offerings to\nthe Maruts, that, with or without Agastya's consent, Indra seized them, and\nthat the Maruts then tried to frighten Indra away with lightning. Agastya and\nIndra, however, pacified the Maruts with this very hymn.\n\nVerse 1.\n\nThe first verse von Roth translates as follows:\n\n'Auf welcher Fahrt sind insgemein begriffen  \n Die altersgleichen mitgebornen Marut?  \n Was wollen sie? woher des Wegs? Das Pfeifen  \n Der Manner klingt: sie haben ein Begehren.'\n\np. xiii\n\n[paragraph continues] Von Roth here translates _s_ ubh by Fahrt, journey. But\ndoes _s_ ubh ever possess that meaning? Von Roth himself in the Dictionary\ntranslates _s_ ubh by Schonheit, Schmuck, Bereitschaft. Grassmann, otherwise a\nstrict adherent of von Roth, does not venture even to give Bereitschaft, but\nonly endorses Glanz and Pracht. Ludwig, a higher authority than Grassmann,\ntranslates _s_ ubh by Glanz. I say then that to translate _s_ ubh by Fahrt,\njourney, may be poetical, but it is not scholarlike. On the meanings of _s_\nubh I have treated I, 87, 3, note 2. See also Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 163.\n\nBut there comes another consideration. That mimikshire is used in the sense of\nbeing joined with splendour, &c. we see from such passages as I, 87, 6, bhanu-\nbhi _h_ sam mimikshire, i. e. 'they were joined with splendour,' and this is\nsaid, as in our passage, of the Maruts. Prof. von Roth brings forward no\npassage where mimikshire is used in the sense in which he uses it here, and\ntherefore I say again, his rendering may be poetical, but it is not\nscholarlike.\n\nTo translate ar _k_ anti _s_ ushmam by 'das Pfeifen klingt,' is, to say the\nleast, very free. _S_ ushma comes, no doubt, from _s_ vas, to breathe, and the\ntransition of meaning from breath to strength is intelligible enough. In the\nPsalms we read (xviii. 15), 'At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils the\nchannels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the earth were\ndiscovered.' Again (Job iv. 9), 'By the blast of God they perish, and by the\nbreath of his nostrils are they consumed; 'Isaiah xi. 4, 'And with the breath\nof his lips shall he slay the wicked.' Wrestlers know why breath or wind means\nstrength, and even in the expression 'une oeuvre de longue haleine,' the\noriginal intention of breath is still perceived. In most passages therefore in\nthe Rig-veda where _s_ ushma occurs, and where it means strength, prowess,\nvigour, we may, if we like, translate it by breath, though it is clear that\nthe poet himself was not always aware of the etymological meaning of the word.\nWhere the sound of _s_ ushma is mentioned (IX, 50, 1; X, 3, 6, &c.), it means\nclearly breath. But when, as in VI, 19, 8, _s_ ushma has the adjectives\ndhanasp _r i_t, sudaksha, we can hardly translate it by anything but strength.\nWhen, therefore,\n\np. xiv\n\nvon Roth translates _s_ ushma by whistling, and ar _k_ anti by sounding, I\nmust demur. Whistling is different from breathing, nor do I know of any\npassage where ar _k_ with _s_ ushma or with any similar word for sound means\nsimply to sound a whistle. Why not translate, they sing their strength, i. e.\nthe Maruts, by their breathing or howling. proclaim themselves their strength?\nWe find a similar idea in I, 87, 3, 'the Maruts have themselves glorified\ntheir greatness.' Neither Grassmann nor Ludwig venture to take _s_ ushma in\nthe sense of whistle, or ar _k_ anti in the sense of sounding. Bergaigne seems\nto take v _ri_ sha _n_ a _h_ as a genitive, referring to Indra, 'ils chantent\nla force a Indra,' which may have been the original meaning, but seems hardly\nappropriate when the verse is placed in the mouth of Indra himself (Journ.\nAsiat. 1884, p. 199). _S_ ushma never occurs as an adjective. The passages in\nwhich von Roth admits sushma as an adjective are not adequate. Does mitgeboren\nin German convey the meaning of sani _l_ a _h_ , 'of the same nest?'\n\nVerse 2.\n\nThe second verse contains few difficulties, and is well rendered by von Roth:\n\n'An wessen Spruchen freuen sich die Jungen?  \n  Wer lenkt die Marut her zu seinem Opfer?  \nGleich Falken streichend durch den Raum der Lufte--  \n  Wie bringt man sie mit Wunscheskraft zum Stehen?'\n\nVerse 3.\n\nThe third verse is rendered by von Roth:\n\n'Wie kommt es, Indra, dass du sonst so munter,  \n  Heut' ganz alleine fahrst, sag an Gebieter!  \nDu pflegtest auf der Fahrt mit uns zu plaudern  \n  Was hast du wider uns, sprich, Rosselenker!'\n\nVon Roth takes kuta _h_ in a causal sense, why? I believe that kuta _h_ never\noccurs in that sense in the Rig-veda. If it does, passages should be produced\nto prove it.\n\nMa\xc2\xb4hina _h_ can never be translated by 'sonst so munter.' This imparts a\nmodern idea which is not in the original.\n\np. xv\n\nSubhanai _h_ does not mean auf der Fahrt, and plaudern, adopted from\nGrassmann, instead of sam p _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ase, introduces again quite a modern\nidea. Ludwig calls such an idea 'abgeschmackt,' insipid, which is rather\nstrong, but not far wrong.\n\nVerse 4.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'Ich liebe Spruche, Wunsche und die Tranke,  \n  Der Duft steigt auf, die Presse ist gerustet;  \nSie flehen, locken mich mit ihrem Anruf,  \n  Und meine Fuchse fuhren mich zum Mahle.'\n\nIt is curious how quickly all difficulties which beset the first line seem to\nvanish in a metrical translation, but the scholar should face the\ndifficulties, though the poet may evade them.\n\nTo translate _s_ ushma _h_ iyarti by 'der Duft steigt auf,' the flavour of the\nsacrifices rises up, is more than even Grassmann ventures on. It is simply\nimpossible. Benfey (Entstehung der mit r anlautenden Personalendungen, p. 34)\ntranslates: 'My thunderbolt, when hurled by me, moves mightily.'\n\nAgain, prabh _ri_ ta _h_ me adrih does not mean die Presse ist gerustet. Where\ndoes Indra ever speak of the stones used for pressing the Soma as my stone,\nand where does prabh _ri_ ta _h_ ever mean gerustet?\n\nVerse 5.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'So werden wir und mit uns unsre Freunde (Nachbarn),  \n  Die freien Manner, unsre Rustung nehmen,  \nUnd lustig unsre Schecken alsbald schirren.  \n  Du kommst uns eben ganz nach Wunsch, o Indra.'\n\nThe first lines are unnecessarily free, and the last decidedly wrong. How can\nsvadha\xc2\xb4m anu hi na _h_ babhu\xc2\xb4tha mean 'Du kommst uns eben ganz nach Wunsch?'\nSvadha does not mean wish, but nature, custom, wont (see I, 6, 4, note 2; and\nBergaigne, Journ. Asiat. 1884, p. 207). Babhutha means 'thou hast become,' not\n'thou comest.'\n\np. xvi\n\nVerse 6.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'Da war's auch nicht so ganz nach Wunsch, o Maruts,  \n  Als ihr allein mich gegen Ahi schicktet!  \nIch aber kraftig, tapfer, unerschrocken,  \n  Ich traf die Gegner alle mit Geschossen.'\n\nThe only doubtful line is the last. Von Roth's former translation of nam, to\nbend away from, to escape from (cf. \xcf\x86\xce\xb5\xe1\xbd\xbb\xce\xb3\xcf\x89 and bhu _g_ ), seems to me still the\nright one. He now translates 'I directed my arrow on every enemy,' when the\ngenitive, as ruled by anamam, requires confirmation. As to sam adhatta I\ncertainly think von Roth's last interpretation better than his first. In the\nDictionary he explained samdha in our passage by to implicate. Grassmann\ntranslated it by to leave or to desert, Ludwig by to employ. I took it\nformerly in the usual sense of joining, so that yat mam ekam samadhatta should\nbe the explanation of svadha, the old custom that you should join me when I am\nalone. But the construction is against this, and I have therefore altered my\ntranslation, so that the sense is, Where was that old custom you speak of,\nwhen you made me to be alone, i. e. when you left me alone, in the fight with\nAhi? The udatta of anamam is not irregular, because it is preceded by hi.\n\nVerse 7.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'Gewaltiges hast du gethan im Bunde  \n  Mit uns, o Held, wir mit vereinter Starke,  \nGewaltiges vermogen wir, du machtiger  \n  Indra, wenn es uns Ernst ist, ihr Gesellen.'\n\nBy this translation, the contrast between 'thou hast done great things with\nus,' and 'Now let us do great things once more,' is lost. K _ri_ _n_ avama\nexpresses an exhortation, not a simple fact, and on this point Grassmann's\nmetrical translation is decidedly preferable.\n\nVerse 8.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'V _ri_ tra schlug ich mit eigner Kraft, ihr Marut,  \n  Und meine Wuth war's, die so kuhn mich machte, p. xvii  \nIch war's, der--in der Faust den Blitz--dem Menschen  \n  Den Zugang bahnte zu den blinkenden Gewassern.'\n\nThis is a very good translation, except that there are some syllables too much\nin the last line. What I miss is the accent on the I. Perhaps this might\nbecome stronger by translating:\n\n'Ich schlug mit eigner Kraft den V _ri_ tra nieder,  \n Ich, Maruts. stark durch meinen Zorn geworden;  \n Ich war's, der blitzbewaffnet fur den Menschen  \n Dem lichten Wasser freie Bahn geschaffen.'\n\nVerse 9.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'Gewiss, nichts ist was je dir widerstunde,  \n Und so wie du gibts keinen zweiten Gott mehr,  \n Nicht jetzt, noch kunftig, der was du vermochte:  \n Thu' denn begeistert was zu thun dich lustet.'\n\nHere I doubt about begeistert being a true rendering of prav _ri_ ddha, grown\nstrong. As to karishya\xc2\xb4 _h_ instead of karishya\xc2\xb4, the reading of the MSS.,\nRoth is inclined to adopt my conjecture, as supported by the analogous passage\nin IV, 30, 23. The form which Ludwig quotes as analogous to karishyam, namely,\npravatsyam, I cannot find, unless it is meant for \xc3\x82past. _S_ rauta S. VI, 27,\n2, namo vo\xe0\xa4\xbdstu pravatsyam iti Bahv _ri_ _k_ a _h_ , where however pravatsyam\nis probably meant for pravatsam.\n\nGrassmann has understood devata rightly, while Roth's translation leaves it\ndoubtful.\n\nVerse 10.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'So soll der Starke Vorrang mir allein sein:  \n  Was ich gewagt, vollfuhr' ich mit Verstandniss.  \nMan kennt mich als den Starken wohl, ihr Marut,  \n  An was ich ruhre, Indra der bemeistert's.'\n\nVon Roth has adopted the translation of the second line, which I suggested in\na note; Ludwig prefers the more abrupt construction which I preferred in the\ntranslation. It is difficult to decide.\n\np. xviii\n\nVerse 11.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'Entzuckt hat euer Ruhmen, mich, ihr Marut,  \n  Das lobenswerthe Wort, das ihr gesprochen,  \nFur mich--den Indra--fur den freud'gen Helden,  \n  Als Freunde fur den Freund, fur mich--von selbst ihr.'\n\nThe last words fur mich--von selbst ihr are not very clear, but the same may\nbe said of the original tanve\xcc\x83 tanu\xc2\xb4bhi _h_. I still adhere to my remark that\ntanu, self, must refer to the same person, though I see that all other\ntranslators take an opposite view. Non liquet.\n\nVerse 12.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'Gefallen find ich, wie sie sind, an ihnen,  \n  In Raschheit und in Frische unvergleichlich.  \nSo oft ich euch, Marut, im Schmuck erblickte,  \n  Erfreut' ich mich und freue jetzt an euch mich.'\n\nThis is again one of those verses which it is far easier to translate than to\nconstrue. \xc3\x81 _k_ _kh_ anta me may mean, they pleased me, but then what is the\nmeaning of _kh_ adayatha _k_ a nunam, 'may you please me now,' instead of what\nwe should expect, 'you do please me now.' In order to avoid this, I took the\nmore frequent meaning of _kh_ ad, to appear, and translated, 'you have\nappeared formerly, appear to me now.'\n\nTo translate anedya _h_ _s_ rava _h_ a\xc2\xb4 isha _h_ dadhana _h_ , by 'in\nRaschheit und in Frische unvergleichlich,' is poetical, but how does it\nbenefit the scholar? I take a dha in the sense of bringing or giving, as it is\noften used cf. II, 38, 5. This is more compatible with isha _h_ , food,\nvigour. I am not certain that a\xcc\x86ne\xcc\x84dy\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84 _h_ can mean blameless. Roth s. v.\nderives anedya from a-nedya, and nedya from nid. But how we get from nid to\nnedya, he does not say. He suggests anedya _h_ or anedya _s_ rava _h_ as\nemendations. I suggested anedyam. But I suspect there is something else behind\nall this. Anediya _h_ may have been intended for 'having nothing coming\nnearer,' and like an-uttama, might express excellence. Or anedya _h_ may have\nbeen an adverb, not nearly.\n\np. xix\n\nThese are mere guesses, and they are rather contradicted by anedya _h_ , used\nin the plural, with anavadya _h_. Still it is better to point out difficulties\nthan to slur them over by translating 'in Raschheit und in Frische\nunvergleichlich.' It is possible that both Roth and Saya _n_ a thought that\nanedya _h_ was connected with nediya _h_ ; but what scholars want to know is\nthe exact construction of a sentence.\n\nVerse 13.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'Ist irgendwo ein Fest fur euch bereitet,  \n  So fahrt doch her zu unsrer Schaar, ihr Schaaren!  \nDer Andacht Regungen in uns belebend,  \n  Und werdet Zeugen unserer frommen Werke.'\n\nIn this verse there is no difficulty, except the exact meaning of apivatayanta\n_h_ , on which I have spoken in note 1.\n\nVerse 14.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'Wo dankbar huldigend der Dichter lobsingt,  \n  Hier wo uns Manya's Kunst zusammenfuhrte,  \nDa kehret ein, ihr Marut, bei den Frommen,  \n  Euch gelten ja des Beters heil'ge Spruche.'\n\nProf. von Roth admits that this is a difficult verse. He translates it, but\nagain he does not help us to construe it. Grassmann also gives us a metrical\ntranslation, but it differs widely from von Roth's:\n\n'Wenn wie zur Spende euch der Dichter herlockt,  \n  Und der Gesang des Weisen uns herbeizog,' &c.;\n\nand so does Geldner's version, unless we are to consider this as an improved\nrendering from von Roth's own pen:\n\n'Wenn uns des Manya Kunst zur Feier herzieht,  \n  Wie Dichter ja zu Festen gerne rufen,' &c.\n\nHere Geldner conjectures duvasya\xc2\xb4 for duvasya\xc2\xb4t, and takes duvase as an\ninfinitive.\n\nVerse 15.\n\nVon Roth:\n\n'Geweiht ist euch der Preis, Marut, die Lieder,  \n  Des Manya, des Mandarasohns, des Dichters,  \nMit Labung kommt herbei, mir selbst zur Starkung  \n  [Gebt Labung uns und wasserreiche Fluren].'\n\np. xx\n\nHow tanve\xcc\x83 vaya\xc2\xb4m is to mean 'mir selbst zur Starkung' has not been explained\nby von Roth. No doubt tanve\xcc\x83 may mean mir selbst, and vayam zur Starkung; but\nthough this may satisfy a poet, scholars want to know how to construe. It\nseems to me that Roth and Lanman (Noun-inflection, p. 552) have made the same\nmistake which I made in taking isham for an accusative of ish, which ought to\nbe isham, and in admitting the masculine gender for v _ri_ _g_ ana in the\nsense of Flur.\n\nI still take yasish _t_ a for the 3 p. sing. of the precative \xc3\x82tmanepada, like\n_g_ anishish _t_ a and vanishish _t_ a. With the preposition ava, yasisish\n_th_ a _h_ in IV, 1, 4, means to turn away. With the preposition a\xc2\xb4 therefore\nyasish _t_ a may well mean to turn towards, to bring. If we took yasish _t_ a\nas a 2 p. plur. in the sense of come, we could not account for the long i, nor\nfor the accusative vayam. We thus get the meaning, 'May this your hymn of\npraise bring vaya\xc2\xb4m,' i. e. a branch, an offshoot or offspring, tanve\xcc\x83, for\nourselves, isha\xc2\xb4, together with food. We then begin a new sentence: 'May we\nfind an invigorating autumn with quickening rain.' It is true that isha, as a\nname of an autumn month, does not occur again in the Rig-veda, but it is found\nin the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a. V _ri_ _g_ ana, possibly in the sense of\npeople or enemies, we have in VII, 32, 27, a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ata _h_ v _ri_ _g_ ana\n_h_ , where Roth reads wrongly a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ata v _ri_ _g_ ana; V, 44, 1 (?); VI,\n35, 5. _G_ iradanu also would be an appropriate epithet to isha.\n\nProfessor Oldenberg has sent me the following notes on this difficult hymn. He\nthinks it is what he calls an \xc3\x82khyana-hymn, consisting of verses which\noriginally formed part of a story in prose. He has treated of this class of\nhymns in the Zeitschrift der D. M. G. XXXIX, 60 seq. He would prefer to\nascribe verses 1 and 2 to Indra, who addresses the Maruts when he meets them\nas they return from a sacrifice. In this case, however, we should have to\naccept riramama as a pluralis majestaticus; and I doubt whether Indra ever\nspeaks of himself in the plural, except it may be in using the pronoun na _h_.\n\nIn verse 4 Professor Oldenberg prefers to take prabh _ri_ to\n\np. xxi\n\nme adri _h_ in the sense of 'the stone for pressing the Soma has been brought\nforth,' and he adds that me need not mean 'my stone,' but 'brought forward for\nme.' He would prefer to read _s_ ushmam iyarti, as in IV, 17, 12; X, 75, 3,\nthough he does not consider this alteration of the text necessary.\n\nProfessor Oldenberg would ascribe vv. 13 and 14 to Indra. The 14th verse would\nthen mean, 'After Manya has brought us (the gods) hither, turn, O Maruts,\ntowards the sage.' Of this interpretation I should like to adopt at all events\nthe last sentence, taking varta for vart-ta, the 2 p. plur. imperat. of v _ri_\nt, after the Ad class.\n\nThe text of the Maitraya _n_ i Sa _m_ hita, lately published by Dr. L. von\nSchroeder, yields a few interesting various readings: v. 5, ekam instead of\netan\xcc\x90; v. 12, _s_ rava instead of _s_ rava; and v. 15, vaya _m_ si as a\nvariant for vayam, which looks like a conjectural emendation.\n\nA comparison like the one we have here instituted between two translations of\nthe same hymn, will serve to show how useless any rendering, whether in prose\nor poetry, would be without notes to justify the meanings of every doubtful\nword and sentence. It will, no doubt, disclose at the same time the unsettled\nstate of Vedic scholarship, but the more fully this fact is acknowledged, the\nbetter, I believe, it will be for the progress of our studies. They have\nsuffered more than from anything else from that baneful positivism which has\ndone so much harm in hieroglyphic and cuneiform researches. That the same\nwords and names should be interpreted differently from year to year, is\nperfectly intelligible to every one who is familiar with the nature of these\ndecipherments. What has seriously injured the credit of these studies is that\nthe latest decipherments have always been represented as final and\nunchangeable. Vedic hymns may seem more easy to decipher than Babylonian and\nEgyptian inscriptions, and in one sense they are. But when we come to really\ndifficult passages, the Vedic hymns often require a far greater effort of\ndivination than the hymns addressed to Egyptian or Babylonian deities. And\nthere is this additional difficulty that when we deal with\n\np. xxii\n\ninscriptions, we have at all events the text as it was engraved from the\nfirst, and we are safe against later modifications and interpolations, while\nin the case of the Veda, even though the text as presupposed by the Prati _s_\nakhyas may be considered as authoritative for the fifth century b.c., how do\nwe know what changes it may have undergone before that time? Nor can I help\ngiving expression once more to misgivings I have so often expressed, whether\nthe date of the Prati _s_ akhyas is really beyond the reach of doubt, and\nwhether, if it is, there is no other way of escaping from the conclusion that\nthe whole collection of the hymns of the Rig-veda, including even the\nValakhilya hymns, existed at that early time a. The more I study the hymns,\nthe more I feel staggered at the conclusion at which all Sanskrit scholars\nseem to have arrived, touching their age. That many of them are old, older\nthan anything else in Sanskrit, their grammar, if nothing else, proclaims in\nthe clearest way. But that some of them are modern imitations is a conviction\nthat forces itself even on the least sceptical minds. Here too we must guard\nagainst positivism, and suspend our judgment, and accept correction with a\nteachable spirit. No one would be more grateful for a way out of the maze of\nVedic chronology than I should be, if a more modern date could be assigned to\nsome of the Vedic hymns than the period of the rise of Buddhism. But how can\nwe account for Buddhism without Vedic hymns? In the oldest Buddhist Suttas the\nhymns of three Vedas are constantly referred to, and warnings are uttered even\nagainst the fourth Veda, the \xc3\x82thabbana b. The Upanishads also, the latest\nproductions of the Brahma _n_ a period, must have been known to the founders\nof Buddhism. From all this there seems to be no escape, and yet I must confess\nthat my conscience quivers in assigning such compositions as the Valakhilya\nhymns to a period preceding the rise of Buddhism in India.\n\np. xxiii\n\nI have often been asked why I began my translation of the Rig-veda with the\nhymns addressed to the Maruts or the Storm-gods, which are certainly not the\nmost attractive of Vedic hymns. I had several reasons, though, as often\nhappens, I could hardly say which of them determined my choice.\n\nFirst of all, they are the most difficult hymns, and therefore they had a\npeculiar attraction in my eyes.\n\nSecondly; as even when translated they required a considerable effort before\nthey could be fully understood, I hoped they would prove attractive to serious\nstudents only, and frighten away the casual reader who has done so much harm\nby meddling with Vedic antiquities. Our grapes, I am glad to say, are still\nsour, and ought to remain so for some time longer.\n\nThirdly, there are few hymns which place the original character of the so-\ncalled deities to whom they are addressed in so clear a light as the hymns\naddressed to the Maruts or Storm-gods. There can be no doubt about the meaning\nof the name, whatever difference of opinion there may be about its etymology.\nMarut and maruta in ordinary Sanskrit mean wind, and more particularly a\nstrong wind, differing by its violent character from vayu or vata a. Nor do\nthe hymns themselves leave us in any doubt as to the natural phenomena with\nwhich the Maruts are identified. Storms which root up the trees of the forest,\nlightning, thunder, and showers of rain, are the background from which the\nMaruts in their personal and dramatic character rise before our eyes. In one\nverse the Maruts are the very phenomena of nature as convulsed by a\nthunderstorm; in the next, with the slightest change of expression, they are\nyoung men, driving on chariots, hurling the thunderbolt, and crushing the\nclouds in order to win the rain. Now they are the sons of Rudra and P _ri_ _s_\nni, the friends and brothers of Indra, now they quarrel with Indra and claim\ntheir own rightful share of praise and sacrifice. Nay, after a time the storm-\ngods in India, like the storm-gods in other countries,\n\np. xxiv\n\nobtain a kind of supremacy, and are invoked by themselves, as if there were no\nother gods beside them. In most of the later native dictionaries, in the\nMedini, Vi _s_ va, Hema _k_ andra, Amara, and Anekarthadhvanima _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ari,\nMarut is given as a synonym of deva, or god in general a, and so is Maru in\nPali.\n\nBut while the hymns addressed to the Maruts enable us to watch the successive\nstages in the development of so-called deities more clearly than any other\nhymns, there is no doubt one drawback, namely, the uncertainty of the\netymology of Marut. The etymology of the name is and always must be the best\nkey to the original intention of a deity. Whatever Zeus became afterwards, he\nwas originally conceived as Dyaus, the bright sky. Whatever changes came over\nCeres in later times, her first name and her first conception was _S_ arad,\nharvest. With regard to Marut I have myself no doubt whatever that Mar-ut\ncomes from the root M![](img/arlig.jpg), in the sense of grinding, crushing,\npounding (Sk. m _ri_ _n_ ati, hi _m_ sayam, part. mur _n_ a, crushed, like m\n_ri_ dita; amur and amuri, destroyer). There is no objection to this\netymology, either on the ground of phonetic rules, or on account of the\nmeaning of Marut b. Professor Kuhn's idea that the name of the Maruts was\nderived from the root M![](img/arlig.jpg), to die, and that the Maruts were\noriginally conceived as the souls of the departed, and afterwards as ghosts,\nspirits, winds, and lastly as storms, derives no support from the Veda.\nAnother etymology, proposed in Bohtlingk's Dictionary, which derives Marut\nfrom a root M![](img/arlig.jpg), to shine, labours under two disadvantages;\nfirst, that there is no such root in Sanskrit c; secondly, that the lurid\nsplendour of the lightning is but a subordinate feature in the character of\nthe Maruts. No better etymology having been proposed, I still maintain that\nthe derivation of Marut from M![](img/arlig.jpg), to pound, to smash, is free\nfrom any objection, and that the original conception of the Maruts was that of\nthe crushing, smashing, striking, tearing, destroying storms.\n\np. xxv\n\nIt is true that we have only two words in Sanskrit formed by the suffix ut,\nmarut and garut in garut-mat, but there are other suffixes which are equally\nrestricted to one or two nouns only. This ut represents an old suffix vat,\njust as us presupposes vas, in vidus (vidushi, vidush _t_ ara) for vid-vas,\nnom. vid-van, acc. vidva _m_ sam. In a similar way we find side by side parus,\nknot, parvan, knot, and parvata, stone, cloud, presupposing such forms as\n*parvat and parut. If then by the side of *parut, we find Latin pars, partis,\nwhy should we object to Mars, Martis as a parallel form of Marut? I do not say\nthe two words are identical, I only maintain that the root is the same, and\nthe two suffixes are mere variants. No doubt Marut might have appeared in\nLatin as Marut, like the neuter cap-ut, capitis (cf. prae-ceps, prae-cipis,\nand prae-cipitis); but Mars, Martis is as good a derivation from\nM![](img/arlig.jpg) as Fors, Fortis is from GH![](img/arlig.jpg) a. Dr. von\nBradke (Zeitschrift der D. M. G., vol. xl, p. 349), though identifying Marut\nwith Mars, proposes a new derivation of Marut, as being originally *Mav _ri_\nt, which would correspond well with Mavors. But *Mav _ri_ t has no meaning in\nSanskrit, and seems grammatically an impossible formation.\n\nIf there could be any doubt as to the original identity of Marut and Mars, it\nis dispelled by the Umbrian name cerfo Martio, which, as Grassmann b has\nshown, corresponds exactly to the expression _s_ ardha-s ma\xc2\xb4ruta-s, the host\nof the Maruts. Such minute coincidences can hardly be accidental, though, as I\nhave myself often remarked, the chapter of accidents in language is certainly\nlarger than we suppose. Thus, in our case, I pointed out that we can observe\nthe transition of the gods of storms into the gods of destruction and war, not\nonly in the Veda, but likewise in the mythology of the Polynesians; and yet\nthe similarity in the Polynesian name of Maru can only be accidental c\n\np. xxvi\n\n[paragraph continues] And I may add that in Estonian also we find storm-gods\ncalled Marutu uled or maro, plural marud a.\n\nFourthly, the hymns addressed to the Maruts seemed to me to possess an\ninterest of their own, because, as it is difficult to doubt the identity of\nthe two names, Marut and Mars, they offered an excellent opportunity for\nwatching the peculiar changes which the same deity would undergo when\ntransferred to India on one side and to Europe on the other. Whether the Greek\nAres also was an offshoot of the same root must seem more doubtful, and I\ncontented myself with giving the principal reasons for and against this theory\nb.\n\nThough these inducements which led me to select the hymns to the Maruts as the\nfirst instalment of a translation of the Rig-veda could hardly prevail with me\nnow, yet I was obliged to place them once more in the foreground, because the\nvolume containing the translation of these hymns with very full notes has been\nused for many years as a text book by those who were beginning the study of\nthe Rig-veda, and was out of print. In order to meet the demand for a book\nwhich could serve as an easy introduction to Vedic studies, I decided to\nreprint the translation of the hymns to the Maruts, and most of the notes,\nthough here and there somewhat abbreviated, and then to continue the same\nhymns, followed by others addressed to Rudra, Vayu, and Vata. My task would,\nof course, have been much easier, if I had been satisfied with making a\nselection, and translating those hymns, or those verses only, which afford no\nvery great difficulties. As it is, I have grappled with every hymn and every\nverse addressed to the Maruts, so that my readers will find in this volume all\nthat the Vedic poets had to say about the Storm-gods.\n\nIn order to show, however, that Vedic hymns, though they begin with a\ndescription of the most striking phenomena of nature, are by no means confined\nto that\n\np. xxvii\n\nnarrow sphere, but rise in the end to the most sublime conception of a supreme\nDeity, I have placed one hymn, that addressed to the Unknown God, at the head\nof my collection. This will clear me, I hope, of the very unfair suspicion\nthat, by beginning my translation of the Rig-veda with hymns celebrating the\nwild forces of nature only, I had wished to represent the Vedic religion as\nnature-worship and nothing else. It will give the thoughtful reader a\nforetaste of what he may expect in the end, and show how vast a sphere of\nreligious thought is filled by what we call by a very promiscuous name, the\nVeda.\n\nThe MS. of this volume was ready, and the printing of it was actually begun in\n1885. A succession of new calls on my time, which admitted of no refusal, have\ndelayed the actual publication till now. This delay, however, has been\ncompensated by one very great advantage. Beginning with hymn 167 of the first\nMa _n_ _d_ ala, Professor Oldenberg has, in the most generous spirit, lent me\nhis help in the final revision of my translation and notes. It is chiefly due\nto him that the results of the latest attempts at the interpretation of the\nVeda, which are scattered about in learned articles and monographs, have been\nutilised for this volume. His suggestions, I need hardly say, have proved most\nvaluable; and though he should not be held responsible for any mistakes that\nmay be discovered, whether in the translation or in the notes, my readers may\nat all events take it for granted that, where my translation seems\nunsatisfactory, Professor Oldenberg also had nothing better to suggest.\n\nConsidering my advancing years, I thought I should act in the true interest of\nVedic scholarship, if for the future also I divided my work with him. While\nfor this volume the chief responsibility rests with me, the second volume will\ncontain the hymns to Agni, as translated and annotated by him, and revised by\nme. In places where we really differ, we shall say so. For the rest, we are\nwilling to share both blame and praise. Our chief object is to help forward a\ncritical study of the Veda, and we are well\n\np. xxviii\n\naware that much of what has been done and can be done in the present state of\nVedic scholarship, is only a kind of reconnaissance, if not a forlorn hope, to\nbe followed hereafter by a patient siege of the hitherto impregnable fortress\nof ancient Vedic literature.\n\nF.
