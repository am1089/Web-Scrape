Charm against the disease balasa.\n\n1\\. The internal disease that has set in, that crumbles the bones, and\ncrumbles the joints, every balasa do thou drive out, that which is in the\nlimbs, and in the joints!  \n2\\. The balasa of him that is afflicted with balasa do I remove, as one gelds\na lusty animal. Its connection do I cut off as the root of a pumpkin.  \n3\\. Fly forth from here, O balasa, as a swift foal (after the mare). And even,\nas the reed in every year, pass away without slaying men!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 105. Charm against cough](av011.htm)\n\n'
