There is the ether within the heart, and in it there is the Person\n(purusha) consisting of mind, immortal, golden.\n\nBetween the two palates there hangs the uvula, like a nipple--that is the\nstarting-point of Indra (the lord) 1. Where the root of the hair divides,\nthere he opens the two sides of the head, and saying Bhu, he enters Agni (the\nfire); saying Bhuvas, he enters Vayu (air);\n\n2\\. Saying Suvas, he enters \xc3\x82ditya (sun); saying Mahas, he enters Brahman. He\nthere obtains lordship, he reaches the lord of the mind. He becomes lord of\nspeech, lord of sight, lord of hearing, lord of knowledge. Nay, more than\nthis. There is the Brahman whose body is ether, whose nature is true,\nrejoicing in the senses (pra _n_ a), delighted in the mind, perfect in peace,\nand immortal.\n\n(1) Worship thus, O Pra _k_ inayogya!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[49:1](sbe15027.htm#fr_207) Cf.
