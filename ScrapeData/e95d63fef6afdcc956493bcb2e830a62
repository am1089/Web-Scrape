(Brahma _n_ as) who neither study nor teach the Veda nor keep sacred fires\nbecome equal to _S_ udras; 1\n\n2\\. And they quote a verse of Manu on this (subject), 'A twice-born man, who\nnot having studied the Veda applies himself to other (and worldly study), soon\nfalls, even while living, to the condition of a _S_ udra, and his descendants\nafter him.' 2\n\n3\\. '(A twice-born man) who does not know the 3\n\np. 17\n\n[paragraph continues] Veda (can)not be (called) a Brahma _n_ a, nor he who\nlives by trade, nor he who (lives as) an actor, nor he who obeys a _S_ udra's\ncommands, nor (he who like) a thief (takes the property of others), nor he who\nmakes his living by the practice of medicine.'\n\n4\\. 'The king shall punish that village where Brahma _n_ as, unobservant of\ntheir sacred duties and ignorant of the Veda, subsist by begging; for it feeds\nrobbers.'\n\n5\\. 'Many thousands (of Brahma _n_ as) cannot form a (legal) assembly (for\ndeclaring the sacred law), if they have not fulfilled their sacred duties, are\nunacquainted with the Veda, and subsist only by the name of their caste.' 5\n\n6\\. 'That sin which dunces, perplexed by ignorance and unacquainted with the\nsacred law, declare (to be duty) shall fall, increased a hundredfold, on those\nwho propound it.' 6\n\n7\\. 'What four or (even) three (Brahma _n_ as) who have completely studied the\nVedas proclaim, that must be distinctly recognised as the sacred law, not (the\ndecision) of a thousand fools.' 7\n\n8\\. 'Offerings to the gods and to the manes must always be given to a _S_\nrotriya alone. For gifts\n\np. 18\n\nbestowed on a man unacquainted with the Veda, reach neither the ancestors nor\nthe gods.'\n\n9\\. 'If a fool lives even in one's house and a (Brahma _n_ a) deeply learned\nin the Veda lives at a great distance, the learned man shall receive the gift.\nThe sin of neglecting (a Brahma _n_ a is not incurred) in (the case of) a\nfool.' 9\n\n10\\. 'The offence of neglecting a Brahma _n_ a cannot be committed against a\ntwice-born man who is ignorant of the Veda. For (in offering sacrifices) one\ndoes not pass by a brilliant fire and throw the oblations into ashes.' 10\n\n11\\. An elephant made of wood, an antelope made of leather, and a Brahma _n_ a\nignorant of the Veda, those three have nothing but the name (of their kind).\n11\n\n12\\. 'Those kingdoms, where ignorant men eat the food of the learned, will be\nvisited by drought; or (some other) great evil will befall (them).'\n\n13\\. If anybody finds treasure (the owner of) which is not known, the king\nshall take it, giving one sixth to the finder. 13\n\n14\\. If a Brahma _n_ a who follows the six (lawful) occupations, finds it, the\nking shall not take it.\n\np. 19\n\n15\\. They declare that the slayer commits no crime by killing an assassin. 15\n\n16\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'An incendiary, likewise a\npoisoner, one who holds a weapon in his hand (ready to kill), a robber, he who\ntakes away land, and he who abducts (another man's) wife, these six are called\nassassins (atatayin).'\n\n17\\. 'He may slay an assassin who comes with the intention of slaying, even\nthough he knows the whole Veda together with the Upanishads; by that (act) he\n(does) not (incur the guilt of) the slayer of a Brahma _n_ a.' 17\n\n18\\. 'He who slays an assassin learned in the Veda and belonging to a noble\nfamily, does not incur by that act the guilt of the murderer of a learned\nBrahma _n_ a.; (in) that (case) fury recoils upon fury.'\n\n19\\. Persons who sanctify the company are, a Tri _n_ a _k_ iketa, one who\nkeeps five fires, a Trisupar _n_ a, one who (knows the texts required for) the\nfour sacrifices (called A _s_ vamedha, Purushamedha, Sarvamedha, and Pit _ri_\nmedha), one who knows the Va _g_ asaneyi- _s_ akha of the White Ya _g_ ur-\nveda, one who knows the six A\xe1\xb9\x85gas, the son of a female married according to\nthe Brahma-rite, one who knows the first part of the Sama-veda Sa _m_ hita,\none who sings the Gyesh _th_ asaman, one who knows the Sa _m_ hita and the\nBrahma _n_ a, one who studies (the treatises on) the sacred law, one whose\nancestors to the ninth degree, both 19\n\np. 20\n\non the mother's and on the father's side, are distinctly known to have been\n_S_ rotriyas, and learned men and Snatakas.\n\n20\\. (Four students of) the four Vedas, one who knows the Mima _m_ sa, one who\nknows the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas, a teacher of the sacred law, and three eminent men who are in\nthree (different) orders, (compose) a (legal) assembly consisting at least of\nten (members). 20\n\n21\\. He who initiates (a pupil) and teaches him the whole Veda is called the\nteacher (a _k_ arya). 21\n\n22\\. But he who (teaches) a portion (of the Veda only is called) the sub-\nteacher (upadhyaya);\n\n23\\. So is he who (teaches) the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas of the Veda.\n\n24\\. A Brahma _n_ a and a Vai _s_ ya may take up arms in self-defence, and in\n(order to prevent) a confusion of the castes. 24\n\n25\\. But that (trade of arms) is the constant (duty) of a Kshatriya, because\nhe is appointed to protect (the people). 25\n\n26\\. Having washed his feet and his hands up to 26\n\np. 21\n\nthe wrist, and sitting with his face turned towards the east or towards the\nnorth, he shall thrice sip water out of the Tirtha sacred to Brahman, (i.e.)\nthe part of the hand above the root of the thumb, without uttering any sound;\n\n27\\. He shall twice wipe (his mouth with the root of the thumb);.\n\n28\\. He shall touch the cavities (of the head) with water;\n\n29\\. He shall pour water on his head and on the left hand;\n\n30\\. He shall not sip water while walking, standing., lying down or bending\nforward. 30\n\n31\\. A Brahma _n_ a (becomes pure) by (sipping) water, free from bubbles and\nfoam, that reaches his heart,\n\n32\\. But a Kshatriya by (sipping water) that reaches his throat,\n\n33\\. A Vai _s_ ya by (sipping water) that wets his palate,\n\n34\\. A woman and a _S_ udra by merely touching water (with the lips).\n\n35\\. Water (for sipping may) even (be taken) out of a hole in the ground, if\nit is fit to slake the thirst of cows. 35\n\n36\\. (He shall not purify himself with water) which has been defiled with\ncolours, perfumes, or flavouring substances, nor with such as is collected in\nunclean places. 36\n\np. 22\n\n37\\. Drops (of saliva) falling from the mouth, which do not touch a limb of\nthe body, do not make (a man) impure. 37\n\n38\\. If, after having sipped water, he sleeps, eats, sneezes, drinks, weeps or\nbathes, or puts on a dress, he must again sip water, 38\n\n39\\. Likewise, if he touches (that part of) the lips on which no hair grows.\n39\n\n40\\. No defilement is caused by the hair of the moustache (entering the\nmouth). 40\n\n41\\. If (remnants of food) adhere to the teeth, (they are pure) like the\nteeth, and he is purified by swallowing those which (become detached) in the\nmouth. 41\n\n42\\. He is not defiled by the drops which fall on his feet, while somebody\ngives to others water for sipping; they are stated to be equally (clean) as\nthe ground. 42\n\n43\\. If, while occupied with eatables, he touches any impure substance, then\nhe shall place that thing (which he holds in his hand) on the ground, sip\nwater and afterwards again use it. 43\n\n44\\. Let him sprinkle with water all objects (the purity of) which may be\ndoubtful.\n\n45\\. 'Both wild animals killed by dogs, and fruit thrown by birds (from the\ntree), what has been spoilt by children, and what has been handled by women,'\n45\n\np. 23\n\n46\\. 'A vendible commodity tendered for sale and what is not dirtied by gnats\nand flies that have settled on it,' 46\n\n47\\. 'Likewise water collected on the ground that quenches the thirst of cows,\n--enumerating all these things, the Lord of created beings has declared them\nto be pure.' 47\n\n48\\. Anything defiled by unclean (substances) becomes pure when the stains and\nthe smell have been removed by water and earth. 48\n\n49\\. (Objects) made of metal must be scoured with ashes, those made of clay\nshould be thoroughly heated by fire, those made of wood should be planed, and\n(cloth) made of thread should be washed. 49\n\n50\\. Stones and gems (should be treated) like objects made of metal, 50\n\n51\\. Conch-shells and pearl-shells like gems,\n\n52\\. (Objects made of) bone like wood, 52\n\n53\\. Ropes, chips (of bamboo), and leather become pure (if treated) like\nclothes, 53\n\n54\\. (Objects) made of fruits, (if rubbed) with (a brush of) cow hair, 54\n\n55\\. Linen cloth, (if smeared) with a paste of yellow mustard (and washed\nafterwards with water). 55\n\np. 24\n\n56\\. But land becomes pure, according to the degree of defilement, by sweeping\n(the defiled spot), by smearing it with cowdung, by scraping it, by sprinkling\n(water) or by heaping (pure earth) on (it). 56\n\n57\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Land is purified by these\nfour methods, by digging, burning, scraping, being trodden on by cows, and\nfifthly by being smeared with cowdung.' 57\n\n58\\. 'A woman is purified by her monthly discharge, a river by its current,\nbrass by (being scoured with) ashes, and an earthen pot by another burning.'\n58\n\n59\\. 'But an earthen vessel which has been defiled by spirituous liquor,\nurine, ordure, phlegm, pus, tears, or blood cannot be purified even by another\nburning.'\n\n60\\. 'The body is purified by water, the internal organ by truth, the soul by\nsacred learning and austerities, and the understanding by knowledge.'\n\n61\\. Gold is purified by water alone, 61\n\n62\\. Likewise silver,\n\np. 25\n\n63\\. Copper is cleansed by acids. 63\n\n64\\. The Tirtha sacred to the Gods lies at the root of the little finger, 64\n\n65\\. That sacred to the _Ri_ shis in the middle of the fingers,\n\n66\\. That sacred to Men at the tips of the fingers,\n\n67\\. That sacred to Agni (fire) in the middle of the hand,\n\n68\\. That sacred to the Manes between the forefinger and the thumb.\n\n69\\. He shall honour (his food at) the evening and morning meals (saying), 'It\npleases me,' 69\n\n70\\. At meals in honour of the Manes (saying), I have dined well,' 70\n\n71\\. At (a dinner given on the occasion of) rites procuring prosperity\n(saying), 'It is perfect: 71\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[16:1](sbe1406.htm#fr_117) **III**. I read _S_ udrasadharma _n_ a _h_ , 'equal\nto _S_ udras,' instead of _s_ udrakarma _n_ a _h_ , which occurs in MS. B.\nonly. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita explains the latter reading by _s_\nudravatkarma yeshu te _s_ udravatteshva _k_ ara _n_ iyamityartha _h_ , 'shall\nbe treated like _S_ udras.' But the verses quoted in the following Sutras show\nthat the former reading is the better one.\n\n[16:2](sbe1406.htm#fr_118) Identical with Manu II, 168.\n\n[16:3](sbe1406.htm#fr_119) This and the following nine verses are, as the word\n'iti,' which the best MSS. give at the end of Sura 12, quotations. p. 17 An\n_ri_ k, 'who does not know the Veda,' means, literally, 'unacquainted with the\nRig-veda.'\n\n[17:5](sbe1406.htm#fr_120) This verse, which is identical with Manu XII, 114,\nand the next two are intended to show that a Brahma _n_ a who, neglects the\nstudy of the Veda, is unfit to decide points of the sacred law, which are not\nsettled either by the Sm _ri_ ti or the _S_ ruti, and become a member of a\nparishad or' Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_.'\n\n[17:6](sbe1406.htm#fr_121) The verse contains a better version of Manu XII,\n115.\n\n[17:7](sbe1406.htm#fr_122) Regarding the term Vedaparaga, see Gautama V, 20,\nnote. Itaresham, 'fools,' means literally, 'different from (those who have\nmastered the Vedas).'\n\n[18:9](sbe1406.htm#fr_123)-10. Regarding the crime of 'neglecting a Brahma _n_\na,' see Manu VIII, 392-393, where fines are prescribed for neglecting to\ninvite to dinner worthy neighbours and _S_ rotriyas.\n\n[18:10](sbe1406.htm#fr_124) A learned Brahma _n_ a resembles a sacrificial\nfire, see e.g. below, XXX, 2-3; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 3, 44.\n\n[18:11](sbe1406.htm#fr_125) Manu II, 157. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita and\nMS. B. give the ungrammatical construction which occurs in Manu and other\nDharma _s_ astras, while the other MSS. read more correctly, 'ya _s_ _k_ a\nkash _th_ amayo h. ya _s_ _k_ a _k_ armamayo m.' &c.\n\n[18:13](sbe1406.htm#fr_126)-14. This rule agrees exactly with Gautama X, 45;\nsee also Vish _n_ u III, 56-61. The matter is introduced here in order to show\nthe prerogative of a learned Brahma _n_ a. Regarding the six lawful\noccupations, see-above, II, 13-14.\n\n[19:15](sbe1406.htm#fr_127) Vish _n_ u V, 189-192. The connexion of this\nsubject with the main topic consists therein that it furnishes an instance\nwhere learning does not protect a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[19:17](sbe1406.htm#fr_128) I read with the majority of the MSS., 'api\nvedantaparagam,' instead of 'vedantaga _m_ ra _n_ e,' as K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_\n_d_ ita has.\n\n[19:19](sbe1406.htm#fr_129) For the explanations of the terms left\nuntranslated, see the p. 20 note on \xc3\x82pastamba II, 8, 17, 22; Gautama XV, 28;\nand the notes on Vish _n_ u LXXXIII, 2-21. Regarding the meaning of _Kh_\nandoga, 'one who knows the first part of the Sama-veda Sa _m_ hita,' see\nWeber, Hist. Ind. Lit., p. 63, note 59. 'One who knows the Sa _m_ hita and the\nBrahma _n_ a, i.e. of the Rig-veda.'--K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita. Regarding\nthe various classes of Snatakas, see \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 30, 1-3.\n\n[20:20](sbe1406.htm#fr_130) Manu XII, 111. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita reads\n_k_ aturvidyas trikalpi _k_ a, 'one who knows the four Vedas and one who knows\nthree different Kalpa-sutras.' My translation, follows the reading of the\nMSS., _k_ aturvidya _m_ vikalpi _k_ a, which is corroborated by the parallel\npassage of Baudhayana I, 1, 8, ' _k_ aturvaidya _m_ vikalpi _k_ a.' The\nexplanation of the latter word is derived from Govindasvamin. 'Men who are in\nthree orders, i.e. a student, a householder, and ascetic,' see Gautama XXVIII,\n49.\n\n[20:21](sbe1406.htm#fr_131)-23. Vish _n_ u XXIX, 1-2.\n\n[20:24](sbe1406.htm#fr_132) Gautama VII, 25.\n\n[20:25](sbe1406.htm#fr_133) Vish _n_ u II, 6.\n\n[20:26](sbe1406.htm#fr_134)-34. Vish _n_ u LXII, 1-9.\n\n[21:30](sbe1406.htm#fr_135) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita is probably right in\nthinking that the word va, 'or,' inserted before 'bending forward,' is\nintended to forbid other improper acts, gestures or postures, which are\nreprehended in other Sm _ri_ tis.\n\n[21:35](sbe1406.htm#fr_136) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 43; Manu V, 128.\n\n[21:36](sbe1406.htm#fr_137) 'Collected in unclean places, e.g. in a burial-\nground.'--K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita.\n\n[22:37](sbe1406.htm#fr_138) Gautama I, 41.\n\n[22:38](sbe1406.htm#fr_139) Gautama I, 37.\n\n[22:39](sbe1406.htm#fr_140) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 10.\n\n[22:40](sbe1406.htm#fr_141) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 11.\n\n[22:41](sbe1406.htm#fr_142) Gautama I, 38-40.\n\n[22:42](sbe1406.htm#fr_143) Manu V, 142.\n\n[22:43](sbe1406.htm#fr_144) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 55. 'Occupied with eatables,'\ni.e. 'eating.'--K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita.\n\n[22:45](sbe1406.htm#fr_145) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 50. This and the following two\nSutras are a quotation, as appears from the use of the particle iti at the end\nof Sutra 47.\n\n[23:46](sbe1406.htm#fr_146) Manu V, 129.\n\n[23:47](sbe1406.htm#fr_147) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 43\n\n[23:48](sbe1406.htm#fr_148) Gautama I, 42. For the explanation of the term\namedhya, 'unclean substances,' see Manu V, 135, and the passage from Devala\ntranslated in Professor Jolly's note on Vish _n_ u XXIII, 38.\n\n[23:49](sbe1406.htm#fr_149) Gautama I, 29; Vish _n_ u XXIII, 26, 33, 27, 18.\n\n[23:50](sbe1406.htm#fr_150)-51. Gautama I, 30.\n\n[23:52](sbe1406.htm#fr_151) Gautama I, 31 and note; Vish _n_ u XXIII, 4.\n\n[23:53](sbe1406.htm#fr_152) Gautama I, 33.\n\n[23:54](sbe1406.htm#fr_153) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 28. Cups and bottles made of the\nshell of the cocoa-nut or of the Bilva (Bel) fruit and of bottle-gourds are\nmeant.\n\n[23:55](sbe1406.htm#fr_154) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 22.\n\n[24:56](sbe1406.htm#fr_155) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 56-57. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_\nita takes upa _k_ ara _n_ a, 'heaping (pure earth) on (the defiled spot),' to\nmean 'lighting a fire on it' or 'digging it up.' The translation given above\nrests on the parallel passages of Gautama I, 32, and of Baudhayana I, 5, 52,\nbhumes tu sa _m_ mar _g_ anaproksha _n_ opalepanavastara _n_\nopalekhanairyathasthana _m_ doshavi _s_ eshat prayatyam, 'land becomes pure,\naccording to the degree of the defilement, by sweeping the (defiled) spot, by\nsprinkling it, by smearing it with cowdung, by scattering (pure earth) on it,\nor by scraping it.' Bhumi, 'land,' includes also the mud-floor of a house or\nof a verandah.\n\n[24:57](sbe1406.htm#fr_156) Some MSS. have instead of gharshat, 'by scraping,'\nvarshat, 'by rain;' see also note on Gautama I, 32.\n\n[24:58](sbe1406.htm#fr_157) Vish _n_ u XXII, 91. 59. Vish _n_ u XXIII, 5. 60.\nIdentical with Manu V, 109, and Vish _n_ u XXII, 92.\n\n[24:61](sbe1406.htm#fr_158)-62. Vish _n_ u XXIII, 7. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_\nita points out that these p. 25 two rules and that given in the next Sutra\nrefer to cases in which gold, silver, and copper have not been stained by\nimpure substances.\n\n[25:63](sbe1406.htm#fr_159) Vish _n_ u XXIII, 25.\n\n[25:64](sbe1406.htm#fr_160)-68. Vish _n_ u LXII, I-4; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 3, II.\n\n[25:69](sbe1406.htm#fr_161) Vish _n_ u LXVIII, 42. The Sutra is also intended\nto prescribe that the number of the daily meals is two, only.\n\n[25:70](sbe1406.htm#fr_162) Manu III, 251.\n\n[25:71](sbe1406.htm#fr_163) The rites referred to are, according to K _ri_ sh\n_n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita, marriages, feeding Brahma _n_ as, Nandi _s_ raddhas, and\nthe like.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV](sbe1407.htm)\n\n"
