VIII.\n\nSons of \xc3\x81yus. Line of Kshatravriddha, or kings of Ka\xc5\x9bi. Former birth of\nDhanwantari. Various names of Pratarddana. Greatness of Alarka.\n\n\xc3\x81YUS, the eldest son of Pururavas, married the daughter of Rahu (or \xc3\x81rahu), by\nwhom he had five sons, Nahusha, Kshatravriddha 1, Rambha 2, Raji, and Anenas\n3.\n\nThe son of Kshatravriddha was Suhotra 4, who had three sons, Ka\xc5\x9ba 5, Le\xc5\x9ba 6,\nand Ghritsamada. The son of the last was \xc5\x9aaunaka 7, who first established the\ndistinctions of the four castes 8. The son of Ka\xc5\x9ba was Ka\xc5\x9biraja 9; his son was\nDirghatamas 10; his son was Dhanwantari, whose nature was exempt from human\ninfirmities, and who in every existence had been master of universal\nknowledge. In his past life (or when he was produced by the agitation of the\nmilky sea), Narayan\xcc\x81a had conferred upon him the boon, that he should\nsubsequently be born in the\n\np. 407\n\nfamily of Kasiraja, should compose the eightfold system of medical science 11,\nand should be thereafter entitled to a share of offerings made to the gods.\nThe son of Dhanwantari was Ketumat; his son was Bhimaratha; his son was\nDivodasa 12; his son was Pratarddana, so\n\np. 408\n\nnamed from destroying the race of Bhadra\xc5\x9bren\xcc\x81ya. He had various other\nappellations, as \xc5\x9aatrujit, \'the victor over his foes,\' from having vanquished\nall his enemies; Vatsa, or \'child,\' from his father\'s frequently calling him\nby that name; Ritadhwaja, \'he whose emblem was truth,\' being a great observer\nof veracity; and Kuvalaya\xc5\x9bwa, because he had a horse (a\xc5\x9bwa) called Kuvalaya\n13. The son of this prince was Alarka, of whom this verse is sung in the\npresent day; "For sixty thousand and sixty hundred years no other youthful\nmonarch except Alarka, reigned over the earth 14." The son of Alarka was\n\np. 409\n\n[paragraph continues] Santati 15; his son was Sunitha; his son was Suketu; his\nson was Dharmaketu; his son was Satyaketu; his son was Vibhu; his son was\nSuvibhu; his son was Sukumara; his son was Dhrisht\xcc\x81aketu; his son was\nVain\xcc\x81ahotra; his son was Bharga; his son was Bhargabhumi; from whom also rules\nfor the four castes were promulgated 16. These are the Ka\xc5\x9bya\n\np. 410\n\nprinces, or descendants of Ka\xc5\x9ba 17. We will now enumerate the descendants of\nRaji.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[406:1](vp101.htm#fr_1069) Dharmavriddha: Vayu. Vriddha\xc5\x9barman: Matsya.\nYajna\xc5\x9barman: Padma.\n\n[406:2](vp101.htm#fr_1070) Darbha: Agni. Dambha: Padma.\n\n[406:3](vp101.htm#fr_1071) Vipapman: Agni and Matsya. Vidaman: Padma. The two\nlast authorities proceed no farther with this line.\n\n[406:4](vp101.htm#fr_1072) Sunahotra: Vayu, Brahma.\n\n[406:5](vp101.htm#fr_1073) Ka\xc5\x9bya: Bhagavata.\n\n[406:6](vp101.htm#fr_1074) Sala: Vayu, Brahma, Hari V.: whose son was\n\xc3\x81rsht\xcc\x81isena, father of Charanta; Vayu: of Ka\xc5\x9byapa; Brahma and Hari V.\n\n[406:7](vp101.htm#fr_1075) Here is probably an error, for the Vayu, Bhagavata,\nand Brahma agree in making \xc5\x9aunaka the son of Ghritsamada, and father of\n\xc5\x9aaunaka.\n\n[406:8](vp101.htm#fr_1076) The expression is \'The originator or causer of the\ndistinctions (or duties) of the four castes.\' The commentator, however,\nunderstands the expression to signify, that his descendants were of the four\ncastes. So also the Vayu: \'The son of Ghritsamada was \xc5\x9aunaka, whose son was\n\xc5\x9aaunaka. Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vai\xc5\x9byas, and \xc5\x9audras were born in his race;\nBrahmans by distinguished deeds.\' The existence of but one caste in the age of\npurity, however incompatible with the legend which ascribes the origin of the\nfour tribes to Brahma, is every where admitted. Their separation is assigned\nto different individuals, whether accurately to any one may be doubted; but\nthe notion indicates that the distinction was of a social or political\ncharacter.\n\n[406:9](vp101.htm#fr_1077) Ka\xc5\x9biya: Brahma.\n\n[406:10](vp101.htm#fr_1078) Dirghatapas: Vayu. Ghritsatamas: Agni. The\nBhagavata inserts a Rasht\xcc\x81ra before this prince, and the Vayu a Dharma after\nhim.\n\n[407:11](vp101.htm#fr_1079) The eight branches of medical science are, 1.\n\xc5\x9aalya, extraction of extraneous bodies; 2. \xc5\x9aalaka, treatment of external\norganic affections: these two constitute surgery: 3. Chikitsa, administration\nof medicines, or medical treatment in general; 4. Bhutavidya, treatment of\nmaladies referred to demoniac possession; 5. Kaumarabhritya, midwifery and\nmanagement of children; 6. Agada, alexipharmacy; 7. Rasayana, alchemical\ntherapeutics; 8. Bajikaran\xcc\x81a, use of aphrodisiacs. Dhanwantari, according to\nthe Brahma Vaivartta P., was preceded in medical science by \xc3\x81treya,\nBharadwaja, and Charaka: his pupil \xc5\x9au\xc5\x9bruta is the reputed author of a\ncelebrated work still extant. It seems probable that Ka\xc5\x9bi or Benares was at an\nearly period a celebrated school of medicine.\n\n[407:12](vp101.htm#fr_1080) Some rather curious legends are connected with\nthis prince in the Vayu and Brahma Puran\xcc\x81as, and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, and especially in\nthe Ka\xc5\x9bi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Skanda Puran\xcc\x81a. According to these authorities, \xc5\x9aiva\nand Parvati, desirous of occupying Ka\xc5\x9bi, which Divodasa possessed, sent\nNikumbha, one of the Gan\xcc\x81as of the former, to lead the prince to the adoption\nof Buddhist doctrines; in consequence of which he was expelled from the sacred\ncity, and, according to the Vayu, founded another on the banks of the Gomati.\nWe have, however, also some singular, though obscure intimations of some of\nthe political events of this and the succeeding reign. The passage of the Vayu\nis, \'The king Divodasa, having slain the hundred sons of Bhadra\xc5\x9bren\xcc\x81ya, took\npossession of his kingdom, which was conquered by that hero. The son of\nBhadra\xc5\x9bren\xcc\x81ya, celebrated by the name of Durdama, was spared by Divodasa, as\nbeing an infant. Pratarddana was the son of Divodasa by Drishadvati; and by\nthat great prince, desirous of destroying all enmity, (was recovered) that\n(territory) which had been seized by that young boy (Durdama).\' This is not\nvery explicit, and something is wanted to complete the sense. The Brahma P.\nand Hari V. tell the story twice over, chiefly in the words of the Vayu, but\nwith some additions. In ch. 29. we have, first, the first three lines of the\nabove extract; then comes the story of Benares being deserted; we then have\nthe two next lines; then follow, \'That prince (Durdama) invading his\npatrimonial possessions, the territory which Divodasa had seized by force was\nrecovered by the gallant son of Bhadhra\xc5\x9bren\xcc\x81ya, Durddama, a warrior desirous,\nmighty king, p. 408 to effect the destruction of his foes.\' Here the victory\nis ascribed to Durddama, in opposition to what appears to be the sense of the\nVayu, and what is undoubtedly that of our text, which says that he was called\nPratarddana from destroying the race of Bhadra\xc5\x9bren\xcc\x81ya, and \xc5\x9aatrujit from\nvanquishing all his foes. By Vairasya anta, \'the end of hostility or enmity,\'\nis obviously not to be understood here, as M. Langlois has intimated, a\nfriendly pacification, but the end or destruction of all enemies. In the 32d\nchapter of the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba we have precisely the same lines, slightly varied as\nto their order; but they are preceded by this verse; \'The city (that on the\nGomati), before the existence of Benares, of Bhadra\xc5\x9bren\xcc\x81ya, a pious prince of\nthe Yadu race: This verse is not in the Brahma P. After giving the rest of the\nabove quotation, except the last line, the passage proceeds, \'The king called\nAsht\xcc\x81aratha was the son of Bhimaratha; and by him, great king, a warrior\ndesirous of destroying his foes was (the country) recovered, the children (of\nDurdama) being infants.\' According to the same authority, we are here to\nunderstand Bhimaratha and Asht\xcc\x81aratha as epithets of Divodasa and Pratarddana.\nFrom these scanty and ill-digested notices it appears, that Divodasa, on being\nexpelled from Benares, took some city and district on the Gomati from the\nfamily of Bhadra\xc5\x9bren\xcc\x81ya; that Durdama recovered the country, and that\nPratarddana again conquered it from his descendants. The alternation concerned\napparently only bordering districts, for the princes of Mahishmati and of Ka\xc5\x9bi\ncontinue, in both an earlier and a later series, in undisturbed possession of\ntheir capitals and their power.\n\n[408:13](vp101.htm#fr_1081) The Vayu, Agni, Brahma P., and Hari V. interpose\ntwo sons of Pratarddana, Garga or Bharga and Vatsa; and they make Vatsa the\nfather of Alarka, except the Brahma, which has \xc5\x9aatrujit and Ritadhwaja as two\nprinces following Vatsa.\n\n[408:14](vp101.htm#fr_1082) The Vayu, Brahma, and Hari V. repeat this stanza,\nand add that Alarka enjoyed such protracted existence through the favour of\nLopamudra, and that having p. 409 lived till the period at which the curs upon\nterminated, he killed the Rakshas Kshemaka, by whom it had been occupied after\nit was abandoned by Divodasa, and caused the city to be reinhabited. The Hari\nV. agrees as usual with the Brahma, except in the reading of one or two names.\nIt is to be observed, however, that the Agni makes the Ka\xc5\x9bi princes the\ndescendants of Vitatha, the successor of Bharata. The Brahma P. and Hari V.,\ndetermined apparently to be right, give the list twice over, deriving it in\none place from Kshatravriddha, as in our text, the Vayu, and the Bhagavata;\nand in another, with the Agni, from Vitatha. The series of the Brahma,\nhowever, stops with Lauhi, the son of Alarka, and does not warrant the\nrepetition which the carelessness of the compiler of the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba has\nsuperfluously inserted.\n\n[409:15](vp101.htm#fr_1083) Several varieties occur, in the series that\nfollows, as the comparative lists will best shew:\n\nBhagavata.\n\n|\n\nBrahma.\n\n|\n\nVayu.\n\n|\n\nAgni.  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \nAlarka\n\n|\n\nAlarka\n\n|\n\nAlarka\n\n|\n\nAlarka  \n  \nSantati\n\n|\n\nSannati\n\n|\n\nSannati\n\n|\n\nDharmaketu  \n  \nSunitha\n\n|\n\nSunitha\n\n|\n\nSunitha\n\n|\n\nVibhu  \n  \nSuketana\n\n|\n\nKshema\n\n|\n\nSuketu\n\n|\n\nSukumara  \n  \nDharmaketu\n\n|\n\nKetumat\n\n|\n\nDhrisht\xcc\x81aketu\n\n|\n\nSatyaketu  \n  \nSatyaketu\n\n|\n\nSuketu\n\n|\n\nVen\xcc\x81uhotra\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nDhrisht\xcc\x81aketu\n\n|\n\nDharmaketu\n\n|\n\nGargya\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nSukumara\n\n|\n\nSatyaketu\n\n|\n\nGargabhumi\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nVitihotra\n\n|\n\nVibhu\n\n|\n\nVatsabhumi\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nBharga\n\n|\n\nAnartta\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nBhargabhumi\n\n|\n\nSukumara\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nDhrisht\xcc\x81aketu\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nVen\xcc\x81uhotri\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nBharga\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nVatsabhumi.\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[409:16](vp101.htm#fr_1084) Our text is clear enough, and so is the Bhagavata,\nbut the Vayu, Brahma, and Hari V. contain additions of rather doubtful import.\nThe former has, \'The son of Ven\xcc\x81uhotra was the celebrated Gargya; Gargabhumi\nwas the son of Gargya; and Vatsa, of the wise Vatsa: virtuous Brahmans and\nKshatriyasp. 410 were the sons of these two.\' By the second Vatsa is perhaps\nmeant Vatsabhumi; and the purport of the passage is, that Gargya (or possibly\nrather Bharga, one of the sons of Pratarddana) and Vatsa were the founders of\ntwo races (Bhumi, \'earth,\' implying \'source\' or founder\', who were Kshatriyas\nby birth, and Brahmans by profession. The Brahma and Hari V., apparently\nmisunderstanding this text, have increased the perplexity. According to them,\nthe son of Ven\xcc\x81uhotra was Bharga; Vatsabhumi was the son of Vatsa; and\nBhargabhumi (Bhrigubhumi, Brahma) was from Bhargava. \'These sons of Angiras\nwere born in the family of Bhrigu, thousands of great might, Brahmans,\nKshatriyas and Vai\xc5\x9byas.\' The commentator has, \'Another son of Vatsa, the\nfather of Alarka, is described, Vatsabhumi, &c. From Bhargava, the brother of\nVatsa. (They were) Angirasas from Galava belonging to that family, (and were\nborn) in the family of Bhrigu from the descent of Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra.\' The\ninterpretation is not very clear, but it authorizes the notion above\nexpressed, that Vatsa and Bharga, the sons of Pratarddana, are the founders of\ntwo races of Kshatriya-Brahmans.\n\n[410:17](vp101.htm#fr_1085) On the subject of note 12. some farther\nillustration is derivable from the Mahabharata, \xc5\x9aanti P. Dana-dharma. Harya\xc5\x9bwa\nthe king of the Ka\xc5\x9bis, reigning between the Ganges and the Yamuna, or in the\nDo-ab, was invaded and slain by the Haihayas, a race descended, according to\nthis authority, from \xc5\x9aaryati, the son of Manu (see p. 358). Sudeva, the son of\nHarya\xc5\x9bwa, was also attacked and defeated by the same enemies. Divodasa, his\nson, built and fortified Benares as a defence against the Haihayas, but in\nvain, for they took it, and compelled him to fly. He sought refuge with\nBharadwaja, by whose favour he had a son born to him, Pratardana, who\ndestroyed the Haihayas under their king Vitihavya, and reestablished the\nkingdom of Ka\xc5\x9bi. Vitihavya, through the protection of Bhrigu, became a\nBrahman. The Mahabharata gives a list of his descendants, which contains\nseveral of the names of the Ka\xc5\x9bya dynasty of the text; thus, Ghritsamada is\nsaid to be his son, and the two last of the line are \xc5\x9aunaka and \xc5\x9aaunaka.
