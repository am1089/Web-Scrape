XXII.\n\nDominion over different provinces of creation assigned to different beings.\nUniversality of Vishn\xcc\x81u. Four varieties of spiritual contemplation. Two\nconditions of spirit. The perceptible attributes of Vishn\xcc\x81u types of his\nimperceptible properties. Vishn\xcc\x81u every thing. Merit of hearing the first book\nof the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\nWHEN Prithu was installed in the government of the earth, the great father of\nthe spheres established sovereignties in other parts of the creation. Soma was\nappointed monarch of the stars and planets, of Brahmans and of plants, of\nsacrifices and of penance. Vaisravan\xcc\x81a was made king over kings; and Varun\xcc\x81a,\nover the waters. Vishn\xcc\x81u was the chief of the \xc3\x81dityas; Pavaka, of the Vasus;\nDaksha, of the patriarchs; Vasava, of the winds. To Prahlada was assigned\ndominion over the Daityas and Danavas; and Yama, the king of justice, was\nappointed the monarch of the Manes (Pitris). Airavata was made the king of\nelephants; Garud\xcc\x81a, of birds; Indra, of the gods. Uchchai\xc5\x9bravas was the chief\nof horses; Vrishabha, of kine. \xc5\x9aesha became the snake-king; the lion, the\nmonarch of the beasts; and the sovereign of the trees was the holy fig-tree 1.\nHaving thus fixed the limits of each authority, the great progenitor Brahma\nstationed rulers for the protection of the different quarters of the world: he\nmade Sudhanwan, the son of the patriarch Viraja, the regent of the east;\nSankhapada, the son of the patriarch Kardama, of the south; the immortal\nKetumat, the son of Rajas, regent of the west; and Hiran\xcc\x81yaroman, the son of\nthe patriarch Parjanya, regent of the north 2. By these the whole earth, with\nits seven continents and its\n\np. 154\n\ncities, is to the present day vigilantly protected, according to their several\nlimits.\n\nAll these monarchs, and whatever others may be invested with authority by the\nmighty Vishn\xcc\x81u, as instruments for the preservation of the world; all the\nkings who have been, and all who shall be; are all, most worthy Brahman, but\nportions of the universal Vishn\xcc\x81u. The rulers of the gods, the rulers of the\nDaityas, the rulers of the Danavas, and the rulers of all malignant spirits;\nthe chief amongst beasts, amongst birds, amongst men, amongst serpents; the\nbest of trees, of mountains, of planets; either those that now are, or that\nshall hereafter be, the most exalted of their kind; are but portions of the\nuniversal Vishn\xcc\x81u. The power of protecting created things, the preservation of\nthe world, resides with no other than Hari, the lord of all. He is the\ncreator, who creates the world; he, the eternal, preserves it in its\nexistence; and he, the destroyer, destroys it; invested severally with the\nattributes of foulness, goodness, and gloom. By a fourfold manifestation does\nJanarddana operate in creation, preservation, and destruction. In one portion,\nas Brahma, the invisible assumes a visible form; in another portion he, as\nMarichi and the rest, is the progenitor of all creatures; his third portion is\ntime; his fourth is all beings: and thus he becomes quadruple in creation,\ninvested with the quality of passion. In the preservation of the world he is,\nin one portion, Vishn\xcc\x81u; in another portion he is Manu and the other\npatriarchs; he is time in a third; and all beings in a fourth portion: and\nthus, endowed with the property of goodness, Purushottama preserves the world.\nWhen he assumes the property of darkness, at the end of all things, the unborn\ndeity becomes in one portion Rudra; in another, the destroying fire; in a\nthird, time; and in a fourth, all beings: and thus, in a quadruple form, he is\nthe destroyer of the world. This, Brahman, is the fourfold condition of the\ndeity at all seasons.\n\nBrahma, Daksha, time, and all creatures are the four energies of Hari, which\nare the causes of creation. Vishn\xcc\x81u, Manu and the rest, time, and all\ncreatures are the four energies of Vishn\xcc\x81u, which are the causes of duration.\nRudra, the destroying fire, time, and all creatures\n\np. 155\n\nare the four energies of Janarddana that are exerted for universal\ndissolution. In the beginning and the duration of the world, until the period\nof its end, creation is the work of Brahma, the patriarchs, and living\nanimals. Brahma creates in the beginning; then the patriarchs beget progeny;\nand then animals incessantly multiply their kinds: but Brahma is not the\nactive agent in creation, independent of time; neither are the patriarchs, nor\nliving animals. So, in the periods of creation and of dissolution, the four\nportions of the god of gods are equally essential. Whatever, oh Brahman, is\nengendered by any living being, the body of Hari is cooperative in the birth\nof that being; so whatever destroys any existing thing, movable or stationary,\nat any time, is the destroying form of Janarddana as Rudra. Thus Janarddana is\nthe creator, the preserver, and the destroyer of the whole world--being\nthreefold--in the several seasons of creation, preservation, and destruction,\naccording to his assumption of the three qualities: but his highest glory 3 is\ndetached from all qualities; for the fourfold essence of the supreme spirit is\ncomposed of true wisdom, pervades all things, is only to be appreciated by\nitself, and admits of no similitude.\n\nMAITREYA.--But, Muni, describe to me fully the four varieties of the condition\nof Brahma, and what is the supreme condition 4.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--That, Maitreya, which is the cause of a thing is called the means\nof effecting it; and that which it is the desire of the soul to accomplish is\nthe thing to be effected. The operations of the Yogi who is desirous of\nliberation, as suppression of breath and the like, are his means: the end is\nthe supreme Brahma, whence he returns to the world no more. Essentially\nconnected with, and dependant upon, the means employed for emancipation by the\nYogi, is discriminative knowledge; and this is the first variety of the\ncondition of Brahma 5. The second\n\np. 156\n\nsort is the knowledge that is to be acquired by the Yogi whose end is escape\nfrom suffering, or eternal felicity. The third kind is the ascertainment of\nthe identity of the end and the means, the rejection of the notion of duality.\nThe last kind is the removal of whatever differences may have been conceived\nby the three first varieties of knowledge, and the consequent contemplation of\nthe true essence of soul. The supreme condition of Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is one with\nwisdom, is the knowledge of truth; which requires no exercise; which is not to\nbe taught; which is internally diffused; which is unequalled; the object of\nwhich is self-illumination; which is simply existent, and is not to be\ndefined; which is tranquil, fearless, pure; which is not the theme of\nreasoning; which stands in need of no support 6. Those Yogis who, by the\nannihilation of ignorance, are resolved into this fourfold Brahma, lose the\nseminal property, and can no longer germinate in the ploughed field of worldly\nexistence. This is the supreme condition, that is called Vishn\xcc\x81u, perfect,\n\np. 157\n\nperpetual, universal, undecaying, entire, and uniform: and the Yogi who\nattains this supreme spirit (Brahma) returns not to life again; for there he\nis freed from the distinction of virtue and vice, from suffering, and from\nsoil.\n\nThere are two states of this Brahma; one with, and one without shape; one\nperishable, and one imperishable; which are inherent in all beings. The\nimperishable is the supreme being; the perishable is all the world. The blaze\nof fire burning on one spot diffuses light and heat around; so the world is\nnothing more than the manifested energy of the supreme Brahma: and inasmuch,\nMaitreya, as the light and heat are stronger or feebler as we are near to the\nfire, or far off from it, so the energy of the supreme is more or less intense\nin the beings that are less or more remote from him. Brahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u, and \xc5\x9aiva\nare the most powerful energies of god; next to them are the inferior deities,\nthen the attendant spirits, then men, then animals, birds, insects,\nvegetables; each becoming more and more feeble as they are farther from their\nprimitive source. In this way, illustrious Brahman, this whole world, although\nin essence imperishable and eternal, appears and disappears, as if it was\nsubject to birth and death.\n\nThe supreme condition of Brahma, which is meditated by the Yogis in the\ncommencement of their abstraction, as invested with form, is Vishn\xcc\x81u, composed\nof all the divine energies, and the essence of Brahma, with whom the mystic\nunion that is sought, and which is accompanied by suitable elements, is\neffected 7 by the devotee whose whole mind is addressed to that object. This\nHari, who is the most immediate of all the energies of Brahma, is his embodied\nshape, composed entirely of his essence; and in him therefore is the whole\nworld interwoven; and from him, and in him, is the universe; and he, the\nsupreme lord of all, comprising all that is perishable and imperishable, bears\nupon him all material and spiritual existence, identified in nature with his\nornaments and weapons.\n\np. 158\n\nMAITREYA.--Tell me in what manner Vishn\xcc\x81u bears the whole world, abiding in\nhis nature, characterised by ornaments and weapons.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Having offered salutation to the mighty and indescribable Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nI repeat to you what was formerly related to me by Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. The glorious\nHari wears the pure soul of the world, undefiled, and void of qualities, as\nthe Kaustubha gem. The chief principle of things (Pradhana) is seated on the\neternal, as the Srivatsa mark. Intellect abides in Madhava, in the form of his\nmace. The lord (\xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bwara) supports egotism (Ahankara) in its twofold division,\ninto elements and organs of sense, in the emblems of his conch-shell and his\nbow. In his hand Vishn\xcc\x81u holds, in the form of his discus, the mind, whose\nthoughts (like the weapon) fly swifter than the winds. The necklace of the\ndeity Vaijayanti, composed of five precious gems 8, is the aggregate of the\nfive elemental rudiments. Janarddana bears, in his numerous shafts, the\nfaculties both of action and of perception. The bright sword of Achyuta is\nholy wisdom, concealed at some seasons in the scabbard of ignorance. In this\nmanner soul, nature, intellect, egotism, the elements, the senses, mind,\nignorance, and wisdom, are all assembled in the person of Hrishike\xc5\x9ba. Hari, in\na delusive form, embodies the shapeless elements of the world, as his weapons\nand his ornaments, for the salvation of mankind 9. Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arikaksha, the lord\nof all, assumes nature, with all its products, soul and all the world. All\nthat is wisdom, all that is ignorance, all that is, all that is not, all that\nis everlasting, is centred in the destroyer of Madhu, the lord of all\ncreatures. The supreme, eternal Hari is time, with its divisions of seconds,\nminutes, days, months, seasons, and years: he is the seven worlds, the earth,\nthe sky, heaven, the world of patriarchs,\n\np. 159\n\nof sages, of saints, of truth: whose form is all worlds; first-born before all\nthe first-born; the supporter of all beings, himself self-sustained: who\nexists in manifold forms, as gods, men, and animals; and is thence the\nsovereign lord of all, eternal: whose shape is all visible things; who is\nwithout shape or form: who is celebrated in the Vedanta as the Rich, Yajush,\nSama, and Atharva Vedas, inspired history, and sacred science. The Vedas, and\ntheir divisions; the institutes of Manu and other lawgivers; traditional\nscriptures, and religious manuals 10; poems, and all that is said or sung; are\nthe body of the mighty Vishn\xcc\x81u, assuming the form of sound. All kinds of\nsubstances, with or without shape, here or elsewhere, are the body of Vishn\xcc\x81u.\nI am Hari. All that I behold is Janarddana; cause and effect are from none\nother than him. The man who knows these truths shall never again experience\nthe afflictions of worldly existence.\n\nThus, Brahman, has the first portion of this Puran\xcc\x81a been duly revealed to\nyou: listening to which, expiates all offences. The man who hears this Puran\xcc\x81a\nobtains the fruit of bathing in the Pushkara lake 11 for twelve years, in the\nmonth of Kartik. The gods bestow upon him who hears this work the dignity of a\ndivine sage, of a patriarch, or of a spirit of heaven.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[153:1](vp057.htm#fr_353) These are similarly enumerated in the Vayu, Brahma,\nPadma, Bhagavata, &c., with some additions; as, Agni, king of the Pitris;\nVayu, of the Gandharbas; Sulapani (\xc5\x9aiva), of the Bhutas; Kuvera, of riches,\nand of the Yakshas; Vasuki, of the Nagas; Takshaka, of serpents; Chitraratha,\nof the Gandharbas; Kamadeva, of the Apsarasas; Viprachitti, of the Danavas;\nRahu, of meteors; Parjanya, of clouds; Samvatsara, of times and seasons;\nSamudra, of rivers; Himavat, of mountains, &c.\n\n[153:2](vp057.htm#fr_354) We have already had occasion to notice the descent\nof these Lokapalas, as specified in the Vayu P.; and it is evident, although\nthe Vishn\xcc\x81u does not supply a connected series of generations, yet that both\naccounts are derived from a common source.\n\n[155:3](vp057.htm#fr_355) Vibhuti, superhuman or divine power or dignity.\n\n[155:4](vp057.htm#fr_356) The question, according to the commentator, implies\na doubt how the supreme being, who is without qualities, can be subject to\nspecific variety, or to existence in divided and different conditions.\n\n[155:5](vp057.htm#fr_357) Of Brahmabhuta; of him who, or that which, becomes\nidentified with the supreme spirit, which is the same respectively with\nabsolute wisdom, Jnana, and discriminative wisdom, Vijnana; leading to\nfelicity, or the condition of Brahma, expressed by the words, p. 156 Sat chit\nanandam, \'entire tranquillity of mind,\' or \'internal enjoyment:\' the same also\nwith the combination of wisdom and tranquillity, which the devotee believes to\nexist in Adwaita, \'non- duality,\' or unity of god and himself: and finally,\nthe same with the aggregate of these three processes, or the conviction that\nspirit is one, universal, and the same.\n\n[156:6](vp057.htm#fr_358) The epithets of Jnyana, \'wisdom,\' here employed, are\ntaken from the Yoga philosophy. \'Requires no exercise,\' Nirvyapara, is\nexplained, \'without the practice of abstract contemplation,\' &c. . \'Not to be\ntaught,\' Anakhyeyam; \'not capable of being enjoined.\' \'Internally diffused,\'\nVyaptimatram, means \'mental identification of individual with universal\nspirit\' . The phrase translated \'the object of which is self-illumination,\' is\nexplained ###. \'Simply existent\' is said to mean, \'being unmodified by the\naccidents of happiness,\' &c.; consequently it is not to be defined . So the\nYoga Pradipa explains Samadhi, or contemplation, to be the entire occupation\nof the thoughts by the idea of Brahma, without any effort of the mind. It is\nthe entire abandonment of the faculties to one all-engrossing notion.\n\'Tranquil,\' Pra\xc5\x9bantam, is, \'being void of passion,\' &c. \'Fearless; not\ndreading agitation or perplexity by ideas of duality. \'Pure;\' undisturbed by\nexternal objects. \'Not the theme of reasoning\'; that is, \'not to be\nascertained by logical deduction.\' \'Stands in no need of support\'; not resting\nor depending upon perceptible objects.\n\n[157:7](vp057.htm#fr_359) The great Yoga is produced. This great Yoga, or\nunion, is to have its relation or dependance, which is Vishn\xcc\x81u; and its seed,\nor mystical ejaculations; and to be accompanied with Mantras and silent\nrepetitions, or Japa.\n\n[158:8](vp057.htm#fr_360) Or of pearl, ruby, emerald, sapphire, and diamond.\n\n[158:9](vp057.htm#fr_361) We have in the text a representation of one mode of\nDhyana, or contemplation, in which the conception of a thing is attempted to\nbe rendered more definite by thinking upon its types; or in which, at least,\nthe thoughts are more readily concentrated by being addressed to a sensible\nemblem, instead of an abstract truth. Thus the Yogi here says to himself, "I\nmeditate upon the jewel on Vishn\xcc\x81u\'s brow, as the soul of the world; upon the\ngem on his breast, as the first principle of things;" and so on: and thus\nthrough a perceptible substance proceeds to an imperceptible idea.\n\n[159:10](vp057.htm#fr_362) \xc3\x81khyanani is said to denote the Puran\xcc\x81as, and\nAnuvada the Kalpa, Sara, and similar works, containing directions for\nsupplementary rites.\n\n[159:11](vp057.htm#fr_363) The celebrated lake Pokher in Ajmer.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter I](vp058.htm)\n\n'
