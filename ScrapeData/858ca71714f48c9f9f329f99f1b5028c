And by a subsequent (Brahma _n_ a) also the 'being of such a kind' of the\nword (is proved). But the connexion is on account of plurality.\n\nThe subsequent Brahma _n_ a ( _S_ at. Br. X, 5, 4) also proves that the text\ntreating of the altars made of mind, and so on, enjoins a meditation only. For\nthat Brahma _n_ a (which begins 'This brick-built fire-altar is this world;\nthe waters are its enclosing-stones,' &c.) declares further on 'whosoever\nknows this thus comes to be that whole Agni who is the space-filler,' and from\nthis it appears that what is enjoined there is a meditation with a special\nresult of its own. And further on (X, 6) there is another meditation enjoined,\nviz. one on Vai _s_ vanara. All this shows that the Agnirahasya book ( _S_ at.\nBr. X) is not solely concerned with the injunction of outward sacrificial\nacts.--But what then is the reason that such matters as the mental\n(meditative) construction of fire-altars which ought to be included in the B\n_ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka are included in the Agnirahasya?--'That connexion is on\naccount of plurality,' i.e. the altars made of mind, and so on, are, in the\nsacred text, dealt with in proximity to the real altar made of bricks, because\nso many details of the latter are mentally to be accomplished in the\nmeditation.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'option with the previous\none.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 51.
