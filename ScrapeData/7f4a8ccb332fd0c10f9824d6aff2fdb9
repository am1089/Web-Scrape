This it obviously is not. It is fair\nenough to call it an elegiac poem, though a precisian might object to the\nterm.\n\nWe have already seen, in speaking of _The Dynasty of Raghu_ , what admiration\nKalidasa felt for his great predecessor Valmiki, the author of the _Ramayana_\n; and it is quite possible that an episode of the early epic suggested to him\nthe idea which he has exquisitely treated in _The Cloud-Messenger_. In the\n_Ramayana_ , after the defeat and death of Ravana, Rama returns with his wife\nand certain heroes of the struggle from Ceylon to his home in Northern India.\nThe journey, made in an aerial car, gives the author an opportunity to\ndescribe the country over which the car must pass in travelling from one end\nof India to the other. The hint thus given him was taken by Kalidasa; a whole\ncanto of _The Dynasty of Raghu_ (the thirteenth) is concerned with the aerial\njourney. Now if, as seems not improbable, _The Dynasty of Raghu_ was the\nearliest of Kalidasa\'s more ambitious works, it is perhaps legitimate to\nimagine him, as he wrote this canto, suddenly inspired with the plan of _The\nCloud-Messenger_.\n\nThis plan is slight and fanciful. A demigod, in consequence of some\ntransgression against his master, the god of wealth, is condemned to leave his\nhome in the Himalayas, and spend a year of exile on a peak in the Vindhya\nMountains, which divide the Deccan from the Ganges basin. He wishes to comfort\nand encourage his wife, but has no messenger to send her. In his despair, he\nbegs a passing cloud to carry his words. He finds it necessary to describe the\nlong journey which the cloud must take, and, as the two termini are skilfully\nchosen, the journey involves a visit to many of the spots famous in Indian\nstory. The description of these spots fills the first half of the poem. The\nsecond half is filled with\n\np. 184\n\na more minute description of the heavenly city, of the home and bride of the\ndemigod, and with the message proper. The proportions of the poem may appear\nunfortunate to the Western reader, in whom the proper names of the first half\nwill wake scanty associations. Indeed, it is no longer possible to identify\nall the places mentioned, though the general route followed by the cloud can\nbe easily traced. The peak from which he starts is probably one near the\nmodern Nagpore. From this peak he flies a little west of north to the Nerbudda\nRiver, and the city of Ujjain; thence pretty straight north to the upper\nGanges and the Himalaya. The geography of the magic city of Alaka is quite\nmythical.\n\n_The Cloud-Messenger_ contains one hundred and fifteen four-line stanzas, in a\nmajestic metre called the "slow-stepper." The English stanza which has been\nchosen for the translation gives perhaps as fair a representation of the\noriginal movement as may be, where direct imitation is out of the question.\nThough the stanza of the translation has five lines to four for the slow-\nstepper, it contains fewer syllables; a constant check on the temptation to\npadding.\n\nThe analysis which accompanies the poem, and which is inserted in Italics at\nthe beginning of each stanza, has more than one object. It saves footnotes; it\nis intended as a real help to comprehension; and it is an eminently Hindu\ndevice. Indeed, it was my first intention to translate literally portions of\nMallinatha\'s famous commentary; and though this did not prove everywhere\nfeasible, there is nothing in the analysis except matter suggested by the\ncommentary.\n\nOne minor point calls for notice. The word Himalaya has been accented on the\nsecond syllable wherever it occurs. This accent is historically correct, and\nhas some foothold in English usage; besides, it is more euphonious and better\nadapted to the needs of the metre.\n\np. 185\n\n### FORMER CLOUD\n\nI\n\n_A Yaksha, or divine attendant on Kubera, god of wealth, is exiled for a year\nfrom his home in the Himalayas. As he dwells on a peak in the Vindhya range,\nhalf India separates him from his young bride_.\n\n  On Rama\'s shady peak where hermits roam,  \nMid streams by Sita\'s bathing sanctified,  \n  An erring Yaksha made his hapless home,  \nDoomed by his master humbly to abide,  \nAnd spend a long, long year of absence from his bride.\n\nII\n\n_After eight months of growing emaciation, the first cloud warns him of the\napproach of the rainy season, when neglected brides are wont to pine and die_.\n\n  Some months were gone; the lonely lover\'s pain  \nHad loosed his golden bracelet day by day  \n  Ere he beheld the harbinger of rain,  \nA cloud that charged the peak in mimic fray,  \nAs an elephant attacks a bank of earth in play.\n\nIII\n\n  Before this cause of lovers\' hopes and fears  \nLong time Kubera\'s bondman sadly bowed  \n  In meditation, choking down his tears--  \nEven happy hearts thrill strangely to the cloud;  \nTo him, poor wretch, the loved embrace was disallowed.\n\nIV\n\n_Unable to send tidings otherwise of his health and unchanging love, he\nresolves to make the cloud his messenger_.\n\n  Longing to save his darling\'s life, unblest  \nWith joyous tidings, through the rainy days,  \n  He plucked fresh blossoms for his cloudy guest,  \nSuch homage as a welcoming comrade pays,  \nAnd bravely spoke brave words of greeting and of praise.\n\np. 186\n\nV\n\n  Nor did it pass the lovelorn Yaksha\'s mind  \nHow all unfitly might his message mate  \n  With a cloud, mere fire and water, smoke and wind--  \nNe\'er yet was lover could discriminate  \n\'Twixt life and lifeless things, in his love-blinded state.\n\nVI\n\n_He prefers his request_ ,\n\n  I know, he said, thy far-famed princely line,  \nThy state, in heaven\'s imperial council chief,  \n  Thy changing forms; to thee, such fate is mine,  \nI come a suppliant in my widowed grief--  \nBetter thy lordly "no" than meaner souls\' relief.\n\nVII\n\n  O cloud, the parching spirit stirs thy pity;  \nMy bride is far, through royal wrath and might;  \n  Bring her my message to the Yaksha city,  \nRich-gardened Alaka, where radiance bright  \nFrom Shiva\'s crescent bathes the palaces in light.\n\nVIII\n\n_hinting at the same time that the cloud will find his kindly labour rewarded\nby pleasures on the road_ ,\n\n  When thou art risen to airy paths of heaven,  \nThrough lifted curls the wanderer\'s love shall peep  \n  And bless the sight of thee for comfort given;  \nWho leaves his bride through cloudy days to weep  \nExcept he be like me, whom chains of bondage keep?\n\nIX\n\n_and by happy omens_.\n\n  While favouring breezes waft thee gently forth,  \nAnd while upon thy left the plover sings  \n  His proud, sweet song, the cranes who know thy worth  \nWill meet thee in the sky on joyful wings  \nAnd for delights anticipated join their rings.\n\np. 187\n\nX\n\n_He assures the cloud that his bride is neither dead nor faithless_ ;\n\n  Yet hasten, O my brother, till thou see--  \nCounting the days that bring the lonely smart--  \n  The faithful wife who only lives for me:  \nA drooping flower is woman\'s loving heart,  \nUpheld by the stem of hope when two true lovers part.\n\nXI\n\n_further, that there will be no lack of travelling companions_.\n\n  And when they hear thy welcome thunders break,  \nWhen mushrooms sprout to greet thy fertile weeks,  \n  The swans who long for the Himalayan lake  \nWill be thy comrades to Kailasa\'s peaks,  \nWith juicy bits of lotus-fibre in their beaks.\n\nXII\n\n  One last embrace upon this mount bestow  \nWhose flanks were pressed by Rama\'s holy feet,  \n  Who yearly strives his love for thee to show,  \nWarmly his well-beloved friend to greet  \nWith the tear of welcome shed when two long-parted meet.\n\nXIII\n\n_He then describes the long journey_ ,\n\n  Learn first, O cloud, the road that thou must go,  \nThen hear my message ere thou speed away;  \n  Before thee mountains rise and rivers flow:  \nWhen thou art weary, on the mountains stay,  \nAnd when exhausted, drink the rivers\' driven spray.\n\nXIV\n\n_beginning with the departure from Rama\'s peak, where dwells a company of\nSiddhas, divine beings of extraordinary sanctity_.\n\n  Elude the heavenly elephants\' clumsy spite;  \nFly from this peak in richest jungle drest;  \n  And Siddha maids who view thy northward flight  \nWill upward gaze in simple terror, lest  \nThe wind be carrying quite away the mountain crest.\n\np. 188\n\nXV\n\n  Bright as a heap of flashing gems, there shines  \nBefore thee on the ant-hill, Indra\'s bow;  \n  Matched with that dazzling rainbow\'s glittering lines,  \nThy sombre form shall find its beauties grow,  \nLike the dark herdsman Vishnu, with peacock-plumes aglow.\n\nXVI\n\n_The Mala Plateau_.\n\n  The farmers\' wives on Mala\'s lofty lea,  \nThough innocent of all coquettish art,  \n  Will give thee loving glances; for on thee  \nDepends the fragrant furrow\'s fruitful part;  \nThence, barely westering, with lightened burden start.\n\nXVII\n\n_The Mango Peak_.\n\n  The Mango Peak whose forest fires were laid  \nBy streams of thine, will soothe thy weariness;  \n  In memory of a former service paid,  \nEven meaner souls spurn not in time of stress  \nA suppliant friend; a soul so lofty, much the less.\n\nXVIII\n\n  With ripened mango-fruits his margins teem;  \nAnd thou, like wetted braids, art blackness quite;  \n  When resting on the mountain, thou wilt seem  \nLike the dark nipple on Earth\'s bosom white,  \nFor mating gods and goddesses a thrilling sight.\n\nXIX\n\n_The Reva, or Nerbudda River, foaming against the mountain side_ ,\n\n  His bowers are sweet to forest maidens ever;  \nDo thou upon his crest a moment bide,  \n  Then fly, rain-quickened, to the Reva river  \nWhich gaily breaks on Vindhya\'s rocky side,  \nLike painted streaks upon an elephant\'s dingy hide.\n\np. 189\n\nXX\n\n_and flavoured with the ichor which exudes from the temples of elephants\nduring the mating season_.\n\n  Where thick rose-apples make the current slow,  \nRefresh thyself from thine exhausted state  \n  With ichor-pungent drops that fragrant flow;  \nThou shalt not then to every wind vibrate  \nEmpty means ever light, and full means added weight.\n\nXXI\n\n  Spying the madder on the banks, half brown,  \nHalf green with shoots that struggle to the birth,  \n  Nibbling where early plantain-buds hang down,  \nScenting the sweet, sweet smell of forest earth,  \nThe deer will trace thy misty track that ends the dearth.\n\nXXII\n\n  Though thou be pledged to ease my darling\'s pain,  \nYet I foresee delay on every hill  \n  Where jasmines blow, and where the peacock-train  \nCries forth with joyful tears a welcome shrill;  \nThy sacrifice is great, but haste thy journey still.\n\nXXIII\n\n_The Dasharna country_ ,\n\n  At thine approach, Dasharna land is blest  \nWith hedgerows where gay buds are all aglow,  \n  With village trees alive with many a nest  \nAbuilding by the old familiar crow,  \nWith lingering swans, with ripe rose-apples\' darker show.\n\nXXIV\n\n_and its capital Vidisha, on the banks of Reed River._\n\n  There shalt thou see the royal city, known  \nAfar, and win the lover\'s fee complete,  \n  If thou subdue thy thunders to a tone  \nOf murmurous gentleness, and taste the sweet,  \nLove-rippling features of the river at thy feet.\n\np. 190\n\nXXV\n\n  A moment rest on Nichais\' mountain then,  \nWhere madder-bushes don their blossom coat  \n  As thrilling to thy touch; where city men  \nO\'er youth\'s unbridled pleasures fondly gloat  \nIn caverns whence the perfumes of gay women float.\n\nXXVI\n\n  Fly on refreshed; and sprinkle buds that fade  \nOn jasmine-vines in gardens wild and rare  \n  By forest rivers; and with loving shade  \nCaress the flower-girls\' heated faces fair,  \nWhereon the lotuses droop withering from their hair.\n\nXXVII\n\n_The famous old city of Ujjain, the home of the poet, and dearly beloved by\nhim_ ;\n\n  Swerve from thy northern path; for westward rise  \nThe palace balconies thou mayst not slight  \n  In fair Ujjain; and if bewitching eyes  \nThat flutter at thy gleams, should not delight  \nThine amorous bosom, useless were thy gift of sight.\n\nXXVII\n\n_and the river, personified as a loving woman, whom the cloud will meet just\nbefore he reaches the city_.\n\n  The neighbouring mountain stream that gliding grants  \nA glimpse of charms in whirling eddies pursed,  \n  While noisy swans accompany her dance  \nLike a tinkling zone, will slake thy loving thirst--  \nA woman always tells her love in gestures first.\n\nXXIX\n\n  Thou only, happy lover! canst repair  \nThe desolation that thine absence made:  \n  Her shrinking current seems the careless hair  \nThat brides deserted wear in single braid,  \nAnd dead leaves falling give her face a paler shade.\n\np. 191\n\nXXX\n\n_The city of Ujjain is fully described_ ,\n\n  Oh, fine Ujjain! Gem to Avanti given,  \nWhere village ancients tell their tales of mirth  \n  And old romance! Oh, radiant bit of heaven,  \nHome of a blest celestial band whose worth  \nSufficed, though fallen from heaven, to bring down heaven on earth!\n\nXXXI\n\n  Where the river-breeze at dawn, with fragrant gain  \nFrom friendly lotus-blossoms, lengthens out  \n  The clear, sweet passion-warbling of the crane,  \nTo cure the women\'s languishing, and flout  \nWith a lover\'s coaxing all their hesitating doubt.\n\nXXXII\n\n  Enriched with odours through the windows drifting  \nFrom perfumed hair, and greeted as a friend  \n  By peacock pets their wings in dances lifting,  \nOn flower-sweet balconies thy labour end,  \nWhere prints of dear pink feet an added glory lend.\n\nXXXIII\n\n_especially its famous shrine to Shiva, called Mahakala_ ;\n\n  Black as the neck of Shiva, very God,  \nDear therefore to his hosts, thou mayest go  \n  To his dread shrine, round which the gardens nod  \nWhen breezes rich with lotus-pollen blow  \nAnd ointments that the gaily bathing maidens know.\n\nXXXIV\n\n  Reaching that temple at another time,  \nWait till the sun is lost to human eyes;  \n  For if thou mayest play the part sublime  \nOf Shiva\'s drum at evening sacrifice,  \nThen hast thou in thy thunders grave a priceless prize.\n\np. 192\n\nXXXV\n\n  The women there, whose girdles long have tinkled  \nIn answer to the dance, whose hands yet seize  \n  And wave their fans with lustrous gems besprinkled,  \nWill feel thine early drops that soothe and please,  \nAnd recompense thee from black eyes like clustering bees.\n\nXXXVI\n\n_and the black cloud, painted with twilight red, is bidden to serve as a robe\nfor the god, instead of the bloody elephant hide which he commonly wears in\nhis wild dance_.\n\n  Clothing thyself in twilight\'s rose-red glory,  \nEmbrace the dancing Shiva\'s tree-like arm;  \n  He will prefer thee to his mantle gory  \nAnd spare his grateful goddess-bride\'s alarm,  \nWhose eager gaze will manifest no fear of harm.\n\nXXXVII\n\n_After one night of repose in the city_ ,\n\n  Where women steal to rendezvous by night  \nThrough darkness that a needle might divide,  \n  Show them the road with lightning-flashes bright  \nAs golden streaks upon the touchstone\'s side--  \nBut rain and thunder not, lest they be terrified.\n\nXXXVIII\n\n  On some rich balcony where sleep the doves,  \nThrough the dark night with thy beloved stay,  \n  The lightning weary with the sport she loves;  \nBut with the sunrise journey on thy way--  \nFor they that labour for a friend do not delay.\n\nXXXIX\n\n  The gallant dries his mistress\' tears that stream  \nWhen he returns at dawn to her embrace--  \n  Prevent thou not the sun\'s bright-fingered beam  \nThat wipes the tear-dew from the lotus\' face;  \nHis anger else were great, and great were thy disgrace.\n\np. 193\n\nXL\n\n_the cloud is besought to travel to Deep River_.\n\n  Thy winsome shadow-soul will surely find  \nAn entrance in Deep River\'s current bright,  \n  As thoughts find entrance in a placid mind;  \nThen let no rudeness of thine own affright  \nThe darting fish that seem her glances lotus-white.\n\nXLI\n\n  But steal her sombre veil of mist away,  \nAlthough her reeds seem hands that clutch the dress  \n  To hide her charms; thou hast no time to stay,  \nYet who that once has known a dear caress  \nCould bear to leave a woman\'s unveiled loveliness?\n\nXLII\n\n_Thence to Holy Peak_ ,\n\n  The breeze \'neath which the breathing acre grants  \nNew odours, and the forest figs hang sleek,  \n  With pleasant whistlings drunk by elephants  \nThrough long and hollow trunks, will gently seek  \nTo waft thee onward fragrantly to Holy Peak.\n\nXLIII\n\n_the dwelling-place of Skanda, god of war, the child of Shiva and Gauri,\nconcerning whose birth more than one quaint tale is told._\n\n  There change thy form; become a cloud of flowers  \nWith heavenly moisture wet, and pay the meed  \n  Of praise to Skanda with thy blossom showers;  \nThat sun-outshining god is Shiva\'s seed,  \nFire-born to save the heavenly hosts in direst need.\n\nXLIV\n\n  God Skanda\'s peacock--he whose eyeballs shine  \nBy Shiva\'s moon, whose flashing fallen plume  \n  The god\'s fond mother wears, a gleaming line  \nOver her ear beside the lotus bloom--  \nWill dance to thunders echoing in the caverns\' room.\n\np. 194\n\nXLV\n\n_Thence to Skin River, so called because it flowed forth from a mountain of\ncattle carcasses, offered in sacrifice by the pious emperor Rantideva_.\n\n  Adore the reed-born god and speed away,  \nWhile Siddhas flee, lest rain should put to shame  \n  The lutes which they devoutly love to play;  \nBut pause to glorify the stream whose name  \nRecalls the sacrificing emperor\'s blessed fame.\n\nXLVI\n\n  Narrow the river seems from heaven\'s blue;  \nAnd gods above, who see her dainty line  \n  Matched, when thou drinkest, with thy darker hue,  \nWill think they see a pearly necklace twine  \nRound Earth, with one great sapphire in its midst ashine.\n\nXLVII\n\n_The province of the Ten Cities_.\n\n  Beyond, the province of Ten Cities lies  \nWhose women, charming with their glances rash,  \n  Will view thine image with bright, eager eyes,  \nDark eyes that dance beneath the lifted lash,  \nAs when black bees round nodding jasmine-blossoms flash.\n\nXLVIII\n\n_The Hallowed Land, where were fought the awful battles of the ancient epic\ntime_.\n\n  Then veil the Hallowed Land in cloudy shade;  \nVisit the field where to this very hour  \n  Lie bones that sank beneath the soldier\'s blade,  \nWhere Arjuna discharged his arrowy shower  \nOn men, as thou thy rain-jets on the lotus-flower.\n\nXLIX\n\n_In these battles, the hero Balarama, whose weapon was a plough-share, would\ntake no part, because kinsmen of his were fighting in each army. He preferred\nto spend the time in drinking from the holy river Sarasvati, though little\naccustomed to any other drink than wine_.\n\n  Sweet friend, drink where those holy waters shine  \nWhich the plough-bearing hero--loath to fight p. 195  \n  His kinsmen--rather drank than sweetest wine  \nWith a loving bride\'s reflected eyes alight;  \nThen, though thy form be black, thine inner soul is bright.\n\nL\n\n_The Ganges River, which originates in heaven. Its fall is broken by the head\nof Shiva, who stands on the Himalaya Mountains; otherwise the shock would be\ntoo great for the earth. But Shiva\'s goddess-bride is displeased_.\n\n  Fly then where Ganges o\'er the king of mountains  \nFalls like a flight of stairs from heaven let down  \n  For the sons of men; she hurls her billowy fountains  \nLike hands to grasp the moon on Shiva\'s crown  \nAnd laughs her foamy laugh at Gauri\'s jealous frown.\n\nLI\n\n_The dark cloud is permitted to mingle with the clear stream of Ganges, as the\nmuddy Jumna River does near the city now called Allahabad_.\n\n  If thou, like some great elephant of the sky,  \nShouldst wish from heaven\'s eminence to bend  \n  And taste the crystal stream, her beauties high--  \nAs thy dark shadows with her whiteness blend--  \nWould be what Jumna\'s waters at Prayaga lend.\n\nLII\n\n_The magnificent Himalaya range_.\n\n  Her birth-place is Himalaya\'s rocky crest  \nWhereon the scent of musk is never lost,  \n  For deer rest ever there where thou wilt rest  \nSombre against the peak with whiteness glossed,  \nLike dark earth by the snow-white bull of Shiva tossed.\n\nLIII\n\n  If, born from friction of the deodars,  \nA scudding fire should prove the mountain\'s bane,  \n  Singeing the tails of yaks with fiery stars,  \nQuench thou the flame with countless streams of rain--  \nThe great have power that they may soothe distress and pain.\n\np. 196\n\nLIV\n\n  If mountain monsters should assail thy path  \nWith angry leaps that of their object fail,  \n  Only to hurt themselves in helpless wrath,  \nScatter the creatures with thy pelting hail--  \nFor who is not despised that strives without avail?\n\nLV\n\n  Bend lowly down and move in reverent state  \nRound Shiva\'s foot-print on the rocky plate  \n  With offerings laden by the saintly great;  \nThe sight means heaven as their eternal fate  \nWhen death and sin are past, for them that faithful wait.\n\nLVI\n\n  The breeze is piping on the bamboo-tree;  \nAnd choirs of heaven sing in union sweet  \n  O\'er demon foe of Shiva\'s victory;  \nIf thunders in the caverns drumlike beat,  \nThen surely Shiva\'s symphony will be complete.\n\nLVII\n\n_The mountain pass called the Swan-gate_.\n\n  Pass by the wonders of the snowy slope;  \nThrough the Swan-gate, through mountain masses rent  \n  To make his fame a path by Bhrigu\'s hope  \nIn long, dark beauty fly, still northward bent,  \nLike Vishnu\'s foot, when he sought the demon\'s chastisement.\n\nLVIII\n\n_And at Mount Kailasa, the long journey is ended_ ;\n\n  Seek then Kailasa\'s hospitable care,  \nWith peaks by magic arms asunder riven,  \n  To whom, as mirror, goddesses repair,  \nSo lotus-bright his summits cloud the heaven,  \nLike form and substance to God\'s daily laughter given.\n\np. 197\n\nLIX\n\n  Like powder black and soft I seem to see  \nThine outline on the mountain slope as bright  \n  As new-sawn tusks of stainless ivory;  \nNo eye could wink before as fair a sight  \nAs dark-blue robes upon the Ploughman\'s shoulder white.\n\nLX\n\n  Should Shiva throw his serpent-ring aside  \nAnd give Gauri his hand, go thou before  \n  Upon the mount of joy to be their guide;  \nConceal within thee all thy watery store  \nAnd seem a terraced stairway to the jewelled floor.\n\nLXI\n\n  I doubt not that celestial maidens sweet  \nWith pointed bracelet gems will prick thee there  \n  To make of thee a shower-bath in the heat;  \nFrighten the playful girls if they should dare  \nTo keep thee longer, friend, with thunder\'s harshest blare.\n\nLXII\n\n  Drink where the golden lotus dots the lake;  \nServe Indra\'s elephant as a veil to hide  \n  His drinking; then the tree of wishing shake,  \nWhose branches like silk garments flutter wide:  \nWith sports like these, O cloud, enjoy the mountain side.\n\nLXIII\n\n_for on this mountain is the city of the Yakshas_.\n\n  Then, in familiar Alaka find rest,  \nDown whom the Ganges\' silken river swirls,  \n  Whose towers cling to her mountain lover\'s breast,  \nWhile clouds adorn her face like glossy curls  \nAnd streams of rain like strings of close-inwoven pearls.\n\n\n\np. 198\n\n### LATTER CLOUD\n\nI\n\n_The splendid heavenly city Alaka_ ,\n\n  Where palaces in much may rival thee  \nTheir ladies gay, thy lightning\'s dazzling powers--  \n  Symphonic drums, thy thunder\'s melody  \nTheir bright mosaic floors, thy silver showers  \nThy rainbow, paintings, and thy height, cloud-licking towers.\n\nII\n\n_where the flowers which on earth blossom at different seasons, are all found\nin bloom the year round_.\n\n  Where the autumn lotus in dear fingers shines,  \nAnd lodh-flowers\' April dust on faces rare,  \n  Spring amaranth with winter jasmine twines  \nIn women\'s braids, and summer siris fair,  \nThe rainy madder in the parting of their hair.\n\nIII\n\n_Here grows the magic tree which yields whatever is desired_.\n\n  Where men with maids whose charm no blemish mars  \nClimb to the open crystal balcony  \n  Inlaid with flower-like sparkling of the stars,  \nAnd drink the love-wine from the wishing-tree,  \nAnd listen to the drums\' deep-thundering dignity.\n\nIV\n\n  Where maidens whom the gods would gladly wed  \nAre fanned by breezes cool with Ganges\' spray  \n  In shadows that the trees of heaven spread;  \nIn golden sands at hunt-the-pearl they play,  \nBury their little fists, and draw them void away.\n\np. 199\n\nV\n\n  Where lovers\' passion-trembling fingers cling  \nTo silken robes whose sashes flutter wide,  \n  The knots undone; and red-lipped women fling,  \nSilly with shame, their rouge from side to side,  \nHoping in vain the flash of jewelled lamps to hide.\n\nVI\n\n  Where, brought to balconies\' palatial tops  \nBy ever-blowing guides, were clouds before  \n  Like thee who spotted paintings with their drops;  \nThen, touched with guilty fear, were seen no more,  \nBut scattered smoke-like through the lattice\' grated door.\n\nVII\n\n_Here are the stones from which drops of water ooze when the moon shines on\nthem_.\n\n  Where from the moonstones hung in nets of thread  \nGreat drops of water trickle in the night--  \n  When the moon shines clear and thou, O cloud, art fled--  \nTo ease the languors of the women\'s plight  \nWho lie relaxed and tired in love\'s embraces tight.\n\nVIII\n\n_Here are the magic gardens of heaven_.\n\n  Where lovers, rich with hidden wealth untold,  \nWander each day with nymphs for ever young,  \n  Enjoy the wonders that the gardens hold,  \nThe Shining Gardens, where the praise is sung  \nOf the god of wealth by choirs with love-impassioned tongue.\n\nIX\n\n  Where sweet nocturnal journeys are betrayed  \nAt sunrise by the fallen flowers from curls  \n  That fluttered as they stole along afraid,  \nBy leaves, by golden lotuses, by pearls,  \nBy broken necklaces that slipped from winsome girls.\n\np. 200\n\nX\n\n_Here the god of love is not seen, because of the presence of his great enemy,\nShiva. Yet his absence is not severely felt_.\n\n  Where the god of love neglects his bee-strung bow,  \nSince Shiva\'s friendship decks Kubera\'s reign;  \n  His task is done by clever maids, for lo!  \nTheir frowning missile glances, darting plain  \nAt lover-targets, never pass the mark in vain.\n\nXI\n\n_Here the goddesses have all needful ornaments. For the Mine of Sentiment\ndeclares_ : " _Women everywhere have four kinds of ornaments--hair-ornaments,\njewels, clothes, cosmetics; anything else is local._ "\n\n  Where the wishing-tree yields all that might enhance  \nThe loveliness of maidens young and sweet:  \n  Bright garments, wine that teaches eyes to dance,  \nAnd flowering twigs, and rarest gems discrete,  \nAnd lac-dye fit to stain their pretty lotus-feet.\n\nXII\n\n_And here is the home of the unhappy Yaksha_ ,\n\n  There, northward from the master\'s palace, see  \nOur home, whose rainbow-gateway shines afar;  \n  And near it grows a little coral-tree,  \nBending \'neath many a blossom\'s clustered star,  \nLoved by my bride as children of adoption are.\n\nXIII\n\n_with its artificial pool_ ;\n\n  A pool is near, to which an emerald stair  \nLeads down, with blooming lotuses of gold  \n  Whose stalks are polished beryl; resting there,  \nThe wistful swans are glad when they behold  \nThine image, and forget the lake they loved of old.\n\nXIV\n\n_its hill of sport, girdled by bright hedges, like the dark cloud girdled by\nthe lightning_ ;\n\n  And on the bank, a sapphire-crested hill  \nRound which the golden plantain-hedges fit; p. 201  \n  She loves the spot; and while I marvel still  \nAt thee, my friend, as flashing lightnings flit  \nAbout thine edge, with restless rapture I remember it.\n\nXV\n\n_its two favourite trees, which will not blossom while their mistress is\ngrieving_ ;\n\n  The ashoka-tree, with sweetly dancing lines,  \nThe favourite bakul-tree, are near the bower  \n  Of amaranth-engirdled jasmine-vines;  \nLike me, they wait to feel the winning power  \nOf her persuasion, ere they blossom into flower.\n\nXVI\n\n_its tame peacock_ ;\n\n  A golden pole is set between the pair,  \nWith crystal perch above its emerald bands  \n  As green as young bamboo; at sunset there  \nThy friend, the blue-necked peacock, rises, stands,  \nAnd dances when she claps her bracelet-tinkling hands.\n\nXVII\n\n_and its painted emblems of the god of wealth_.\n\n  These are the signs--recall them o\'er and o\'er,  \nMy clever friend--by which the house is known,  \n  And the Conch and Lotus painted by the door:  \nAlas! when I am far, the charm is gone--  \nThe lotus\' loveliness is lost with set of sun.\n\nXVIII\n\n  Small as the elephant cub thou must become  \nFor easy entrance; rest where gems enhance  \n  The glory of the hill beside my home,  \nAnd peep into the house with lightning-glance,  \nBut make its brightness dim as fireflies\' twinkling dance.\n\nXIX\n\n_The Yaksha\'s bride_.\n\n  The supremest woman from God\'s workshop gone--  \nYoung, slender; little teeth and red, red lips,  \n  Slight waist and gentle eyes of timid fawn,  \nAn idly graceful movement, generous hips,  \nFair bosom into which the sloping shoulder slips--\n\np. 202\n\nXX\n\n  Like a bird that mourns her absent mate anew  \nPassing these heavy days in longings keen,  \n  My girlish wife whose words are sweet and few,  \nMy second life, shall there of thee be seen--  \nBut changed like winter-blighted lotus-blooms, I ween.\n\nXXI\n\n  Her eyes are swol\'n with tears that stream unchidden;  \nHer lips turn pale with sorrow\'s burning sighs;  \n  The face that rests upon her hand is hidden  \nBy hanging curls, as when the glory dies  \nOf the suffering moon pursued by thee through nightly skies.\n\nXXII\n\n_The passion of love passes through ten stages, eight of which are suggested\nin this stanza and the stanzas which follow. The first stage is not indicated;\nit is called Exchange of Glances_.\n\n  Thou first wilt see her when she seeks relief  \nIn worship; or, half fancying, half recalling,  \n  She draws mine image worn by absent grief;  \nOr asks the caged, sweetly-singing starling:  \n"Do you remember, dear, our lord? You were his darling."\n\nXXIII\n\n_In this stanza and the preceding one is suggested the second stage:\nWistfulness_.\n\n  Or holds a lute on her neglected skirt,  \nAnd tries to sing of me, and tries in vain;  \n  For she dries the tear-wet string with hands inert,  \nAnd e\'er begins, and e\'er forgets again,  \nThough she herself composed it once, the loving strain.\n\nXXIV\n\n_Here is suggested the third stage: Desire_.\n\n  Or counts the months of absence yet remaining  \nWith flowers laid near the threshold on the floor,  \n  Or tastes the bliss of hours when love was gaining  \nThe memories recollected o\'er and o\'er--  \nA woman\'s comforts when her lonely heart is sore.\n\np. 203\n\nXXV\n\n_Were is suggested the fourth stage: Wakefulness_.\n\n  Such daytime labours doubtless ease the ache  \nWhich doubly hurts her in the helpless dark;  \n  With news from me a keener joy to wake,  \nStand by her window in the night, and mark  \nMy sleepless darling on her pallet hard and stark.\n\nXXVI\n\n_Here is suggested the fifth stage: Emaciation_.\n\n  Resting one side upon that widowed bed,  \nLike the slender moon upon the Eastern height,  \n  So slender she, now worn with anguish dread,  \nPassing with stifling tears the long, sad night  \nWhich, spent in love with me, seemed but a moment\'s flight.\n\nXXVII\n\n_Here is suggested the sixth stage: Loss of Interest in Ordinary Pleasures_.\n\n  On the cool, sweet moon that through the lattice flashes  \nShe looks with the old delight, then turns away  \n  And veils her eyes with water-weighted lashes,  \nSad as the flower that blooms in sunlight gay,  \nBut cannot wake nor slumber on a cloudy day.\n\nXXVIII\n\n_Here is suggested the seventh stage: Loss of Youthful Bashfulness_.\n\n  One unanointed curl still frets her cheek  \nWhen tossed by sighs that bum her blossom-lip;  \n  And still she yearns, and still her yearnings seek  \nThat we might be united though in sleep  \nAh! Happy dreams come not to brides that ever weep.\n\nXXIX\n\n_Here is suggested the eighth stage: Absentmindedness. For if she were not\nabsentminded, she would arrange the braid so as not to be annoyed by it_.\n\n  Her single tight-bound braid she pushes oft--  \nWith a hand uncared for in her lonely madness--  \n  So rough it seems, from the cheek that is so soft:  \nThat braid ungarlanded since the first day\'s sadness,  \nWhich I shall loose again when troubles end in gladness.\n\np. 204\n\nXXX\n\n_Here is suggested the ninth stage: Prostration. The tenth stage, Death, is\nnot suggested_.\n\n  The delicate body, weak and suffering,  \nQuite unadorned and tossing to and fro  \n  In oft-renewing wretchedness, will wring  \nEven from thee a raindrop-tear, I know--  \nSoft breasts like thine are pitiful to others\' woe.\n\nXXXI\n\n  I know her bosom full of love for me,  \nAnd therefore fancy how her soul doth grieve  \n  In this our first divorce; it cannot be  \nSelf-flattery that idle boastings weave--  \nSoon shalt thou see it all, and seeing, shalt believe.\n\nXXXII\n\n_Quivering of the eyelids_\n\n  Her hanging hair prevents the twinkling shine  \nOf fawn-eyes that forget their glances sly,  \n  Lost to the friendly aid of rouge and wine--  \nYet the eyelids quiver when thou drawest nigh  \nAs water-lilies do when fish go scurrying by.\n\nXXXIII\n\n_and trembling of the limbs are omens of speedy union with the beloved_.\n\n  And limbs that thrill to thee thy welcome prove,  \nLimbs fair as stems in some rich plantain-bower,  \n  No longer showing marks of my rough love,  \nRobbed of their cooling pearls by fatal power,  \nThe limbs which I was wont to soothe in passion\'s hour.\n\nXXXIV\n\n  But if she should be lost in happy sleep,  \nWait, bear with her, grant her but three hours\' grace,  \n  And thunder not, O cloud, but let her keep  \nThe dreaming vision of her lover\'s face--  \nLoose not too soon the imagined knot of that embrace.\n\np. 205\n\nXXXV\n\n  As thou wouldst wake the jasmine\'s budding wonder,  \nWake her with breezes blowing mistily;  \n  Conceal thy lightnings, and with words of thunder  \nSpeak boldly, though she answer haughtily  \nWith eyes that fasten on the lattice and on thee.\n\nXXXVI\n\n_The cloud is instructed how to announce himself_\n\n  "Thou art no widow; for thy husband\'s friend  \nIs come to tell thee what himself did say--  \n  A cloud with low, sweet thunder-tones that send  \nAll weary wanderers hastening on their way,  \nEager to loose the braids of wives that lonely stay."\n\nXXXVII\n\n_in such a way as to win the favour of his auditor_.\n\n  Say this, and she will welcome thee indeed,  \nSweet friend, with a yearning heart\'s tumultuous beating  \n  And joy-uplifted eyes; and she will heed  \nThe after message: such a friendly greeting  \nIs hardly less to woman\'s heart than lovers\' meeting.\n\nXXXVIII\n\n_The message itself_.\n\n  Thus too, my king, I pray of thee to speak,  \nRemembering kindness is its own reward;  \n  "Thy lover lives, and from the holy peak  \nAsks if these absent days good health afford--  \nThose born to pain must ever use this opening word.\n\nXXXIX\n\n  With body worn as thine, with pain as deep,  \nWith tears and ceaseless longings answering thine,  \n  With sighs more burning than the sighs that keep  \nThy lips ascorch--doomed far from thee to pine,  \nHe too doth weave the fancies that thy soul entwine.\n\np. 206\n\nXL\n\n  He used to love, when women friends were near,  \nTo whisper things he might have said aloud  \n  That he might touch thy face and kiss thine ear;  \nUnheard and even unseen, no longer proud,  \nHe now must send this yearning message by a cloud.\n\nXLI\n\n_According to the treatise called "Virtue\'s Banner," a lover has four solaces\nin separation: first, looking at objects that remind him of her he loves_ ;\n\n  \'I see thy limbs in graceful-creeping vines,  \nThy glances in the eyes of gentle deer,  \n  Thine eyebrows in the ripple\'s dancing lines,  \nThy locks in plumes, thy face in moonlight clear--  \nAh, jealous! But the whole sweet image is not here.\n\nXLII\n\n_second, painting a picture of her_ ;\n\n  And when I paint that loving jealousy  \nWith chalk upon the rock, and my caress  \n  As at thy feet I lie, I cannot see  \nThrough tears that to mine eyes unbidden press--  \nSo stern a fate denies a painted happiness.\n\nXLIII\n\n_third, dreaming of her_ ;\n\n  And when I toss mine arms to clasp thee tight,  \nMine own though but in visions of a dream--  \n  They who behold the oft-repeated sight,  \nThe kind divinities of wood and stream,  \nLet fall great pearly tears that on the blossoms gleam.\n\nXLIV\n\n_fourth, touching something which she has touched_.\n\n  Himalaya\'s breeze blows gently from the north,  \nUnsheathing twigs upon the deodar  \n  And sweet with sap that it entices forth  \nI embrace it lovingly; it came so far,  \nPerhaps it touched thee first, my life\'s unchanging star!\n\np. 207\n\nXLV\n\n  Oh, might the long, long night seem short to me!  \nOh, might the day his hourly tortures hide!  \n  Such longings for the things that cannot be,  \nConsume my helpless heart, sweet-glancing bride,  \nIn burning agonies of absence from thy side.\n\nXLVI\n\n_The bride is besought not to lose heart at hearing of her lover\'s\nwretchedness_ ,\n\n  Yet much reflection, dearest, makes me strong,  \nStrong with an inner strength; nor shouldst thou feel  \n  Despair at what has come to us of wrong;  \nWho has unending woe or lasting weal?  \nOur fates move up and down upon a circling wheel.\n\nXLVII\n\n_and to remember that the curse has its appointed end, when the rainy season\nis over and the year of exile fulfilled. Vishnu spends the rainy months in\nsleep upon the back of the cosmic serpent Shesha_.\n\n  When Vishnu rises from his serpent bed  \nThe curse is ended; close thine eyelids tight  \n  And wait till only four months more are sped;  \nThen we shall taste each long-desired delight  \nThrough nights that the full autumn moon illumines bright.\n\nXLVIII\n\n_Then is added a secret which, as it could not possibly be known to a third\nperson, assures her that the cloud is a true messenger_.\n\n  And one thing more: thou layest once asleep,  \nClasping my neck, then wakening with a scream;  \n  And when I wondered why, thou couldst but weep  \nA while, and then a smile began to beam:  \n"Rogue! Rogue! I saw thee with another girl in dream."\n\np. 208\n\nXLIX\n\n  This memory shows me cheerful, gentle wife;  \nThen let no gossip thy suspicions move:  \n  They say the affections strangely forfeit life  \nIn separation, but in truth they prove  \nToward the absent dear, a growing bulk of tenderest love.\'"\n\nL\n\n_The Yaksha then begs the cloud to return with a message of comfort_ ,\n\n  Console her patient heart, to breaking full  \nIn our first separation; having spoken,  \n  Fly from the mountain ploughed by Shiva\'s bull;  \nMake strong with message and with tender token  \nMy life, so easily, like morning jasmines, broken.\n\nLI\n\n  I hope, sweet friend, thou grantest all my suit,  \nNor read refusal in thy solemn air;  \n  When thirsty birds complain, thou givest mute  \nThe rain from heaven: such simple hearts are rare,  \nWhose only answer is fulfilment of the prayer.\n\nLII\n\n_and dismisses him, with a prayer for his welfare_.\n\n  Thus, though I pray unworthy, answer me  \nFor friendship\'s sake, or pity\'s, magnified  \n  By the sight of my distress; then wander free  \nIn rainy loveliness, and ne\'er abide  \nOne moment\'s separation from thy lightning bride.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Seasons](sha18.htm)\n\n'
