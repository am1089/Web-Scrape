(They are) the priest's work, Au _d_ ulomi thinks; since for that he is\nengaged.\n\nThe teacher Au _d_ ulomi is of opinion that the meditation on the Udgitha and\nthe like is the work of the priest, since it is he who is engaged for the\npurpose of performing that which gives rise to the fruit, i.e. of the entire\nsacrifice with all its subordinate parts. Injunctions referring to the\nperformance of the sacrifices such as 'he chooses the priests; he gives to the\npriests their fee' indicate that the entire sacrificial performance is the\nwork of the priests, and that hence all activities comprised within it--mental\nas well as bodily--belong to the priests. Capability or non-capability does\nnot constitute the criterion in this case. For although the meditations in\nquestion aim directly at the benefit of man (not at the greater perfection of\nthe sacrifice), yet since they fall within the sphere of qualification of\nthose who are qualified for the sacrifice, and since the sacrifice with all\nits subordinate elements has to be performed by the priests, and since the\ntext 'whatever he does with knowledge that becomes more vigorous ' declares\nknowledge to belong to the same agent as the works which are benefited by such\nknowledge, we conclude that those meditations also are the exclusive duty of\nthe priests. In the case of the meditations on the small ether, &c., on the\nother hand, the text says nothing as to their having to be performed by\npriests, and we therefore assume in accordance with the general principle that\n'the fruit belongs to the performer,' that the agent there is the person to\nwhom Scripture assigns the fruit.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the\nlord (of the sacrifice).'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 46.
