I needs must go  \nHence to the shades weighed down by woe.  \nThe king our sire will see me there,  \nAnd cry, \'O perjured Rama, where.  \nWhere is thy faith, that thou canst speed  \nFrom exile ere the time decreed?  \n   Ah Sita, whither hast thou fled  \nAnd left me here disquieted,  \nA hapless mourner, reft of hone.  \nToo feeble with my woe to cope?  \nE\'en thus indignant Glory flies  \nThe wretch who stains his soul with lies.  \nIf thou, my love, art lost to view,  \nI in my woe must perish too.\'  \n   Thus Rama by big grief distraught  \nWept for the wife he vainly sought.  \nAnd Lakshman whose fraternal breast  \nLonged for his weal, the chief addressed  \n\np. 302  \n\nWhose soul gave way beneath the pain  \nWhen all his eager search was vain.  \nLike some great elephant who stands  \nSinking upon the treacherous sands:  \n\'Not yet, O wisest chief, despair;  \nRenew thy toil with utmost care.  \nThis noble hill where trees are green  \nHas many a cave and dark ravine.  \nThe Maithil lady day by day  \nDelighted in the woods to stray.  \nDeep in the grove she wanders still.  \nOr walks by blossom-covered rill,  \nOr fish-loved river stealing through  \nTall clusters of the dark bamboo.  \nOr else the dame with arch design  \nTo prove thy mood, O Prince, and mine,  \nFar in some sheltering thicket lies  \nTo frighten ere she meet our eyes.  \nThen come, renew thy labour, trace  \nThe lady to her lurking-place,  \nAnd search the wood from side to aide  \nTo know where Sita loves to bide.  \nCollect thy thoughts, O royal chief,  \nNor yield to unavailing grief.\'  \n   Thus Lakshman, by attention stirred,  \nTo fresh attempts his brother spurred,  \nAnd Rama, as he ceased, began  \nWith Lakshman\'s aid each spot to scan.  \nIn eager search their way they took  \nThrough wood, o\'er hill, by pool and brook,  \nThey roamed each mount, nor spared to seek  \nOn ridge and crag and towering peak.  \nThey sought the dame in every spot;  \nBut all in vain; they found her not.  \nAbove, below, on every side  \nThey ranged the hill, and Rama cried,  \n\'O Lakshman, O my brother still  \nNo trace of Sita on\'the hill!\'  \nThen Lakshman as he roamed the wood  \nBeside his glorious brother stood,  \nAnd while fierce grief his bosom burned  \nThis answer to the chief retained:  \n\'Thou, Rama, after toil and pain  \nWilt meet the Maithil dame again,  \nAs Vishnu, Buli\'s might subdued,  \nHis empire of the earth renewed.\' 1  \n   Then Rama cried in mournful tone,  \nHis spirit by his woe o\'erthrown;  \n\'The wood is searched from side to side,  \nNo distant spot remains untried,  \nNo lilied pool, no streamlet where  \nThe lotus buds are fresh and fair.  \nOur eyes have searched the hill with all  \nHis caves and every waterfall,--  \nBut ah, not yet I find my wife,  \nMore precious than the breath of life.\'  \n   As thus he mourned his vanished dame  \nA mighty trembling seized his frame,  \n\nAnd by o\'erpowering grief assailed,  \nHis troubled senses reeled and failed.  \nToo great to bear his misery grew,  \nAnd many a long hot sigh he drew,  \nThen as he wept and sobbed and sighed,  \n"O Sita, O my love!\' he cried.  \nThen Lakshman, joining palm to palm,  \nTried every art his woe to calm.  \nBut Rama in his anguish heard  \nOr heeded not one soothing word.  \nStill for his spouse he mourned, and shrill  \nRang out his lamentation still,  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[302:1](ry260.htm#fr_509) See Book I.
