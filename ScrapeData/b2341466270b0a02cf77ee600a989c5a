At the (moment of) departing (he frees himself from his works), there\nbeing nothing to be reached (by him, on the way to Brahman, through those\nworks); for thus others (declare, in their sacred texts).\n\np. 230\n\nThe Kaushitakins record in the parya\xe1\xb9\x85ka-vidya how the man (who possesses true\nknowledge) when approaching Brahman seated on the couch frees himself on the\nway from his good and evil deeds, 'He having reached the path of the gods\ncomes to the world of Agni,' &c. (Kau. Up. I, 3), and later on (I, 4), 'He\ncomes to the river Vi _g_ ara and crosses it by the mind alone and there\nshakes off his good and evil deeds.'--The question here arises whether in\nstrict agreement with the text we have to understand that the deceased man\nfrees himself from his good and evil deeds on the way to Brahman, or rather\nthat he does so at the outset when he departs from his body.\n\nThe letter of the text favouring the former alternative, the Sutrakara rebuts\nit by declaring 'at the going,' i.e. at the time of departing from the body\nthe man frees himself, through the strength of his knowledge, from his good\nand evil deeds. The reason for this averment is assigned in the words, 'On\naccount of the absence of anything to be reached.' For when the man possessing\ntrue knowledge has departed from the body and is, through his knowledge, about\nto reach Brahman, there exists nothing to be reached by him on the way through\nhis good and evil works, and we therefore have no reason to assume the latter\nto remain uneffaced during a certain number of moments. We rather have to\nconclude that as the results of his good and evil works are contrary to the\nresult of knowledge, they are destroyed by the power of the latter; and that\nhence the moment of their destruction is that moment in which he sets out\ntoward the fruit of his knowledge (i.e. the world of Brahman).--The conclusion\nthus is that the deliverance of the man from his works takes place early, and\nis only mentioned later on in the text of the Kaushitakins.--Thus other _S_\nakhas also, as that of the Ta _n_ _d_ ins and Sa _t_ yayanins, declare that he\nfrees himself from his deeds at an earlier stage; cp. the passages, 'Shaking\noff all evil as a horse shakes his hair,' and 'His sons obtain his\ninheritance, his friends the good, his enemies the evil he has done.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 28](sbe38171.htm)\n\n"
