It is well known that the country along the coast to the\nsouth of the mouths of the Ganges was the seat of this people. Hence it may be\nsuspected that this Mahendra is what Pliny calls "promontorium Calingon". The\nmodern name, _Cape Palmyras_ , from the palmyras Borassus flabelliformis,\nwhich abound there agrees remarkably with the description of the poet who\nspeaks of the groves of these trees. _Raghuvansa_ , VI. 51.\' SCHLEGEL.\n\n[86:1b](ry075.htm#fr_256) S\'iva\n\n[86:2b](ry075.htm#fr_257) S\'iva.
