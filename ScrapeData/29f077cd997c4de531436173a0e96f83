Previously to the shaving\n\np. 6\n\nof his hair and beard he may eat of what he likes, or whatever comes to hand;\nfor hereafter his food consists of fast-milk (vrata) only. But, if he does not\ncare to eat, he need not eat anything.\n\n3:1:2:22\\. Thereupon they enclose a place 1 north of the hall, and place a\nvessel of water in it. Beside this the barber takes up his position. He (the\nsacrificer) then shaves his hair and beard, and cuts his nails. For impure,\nindeed, is that part of man where water does not reach him. Now at the hair\nand beard, and at the nails the water does not reach him: hence when he shaves\nhis hair and beard, and cuts his nails, he does so in order that he may be\nconsecrated after becoming pure.\n\n3:1:2:33\\. Now some shave themselves all over, in order that they may be\nconsecrated after becoming pure all over; but let him not do this. For even by\nshaving the hair of his head and his beard, and by cutting his nails, he\nbecomes pure: let him therefore shave only the hair of his head and his beard,\nand cut his nails.\n\n3:1:2:44\\. In the first place he cuts his nails, first of the right hand--for\nin human (practice) those of the left hand (are cut) first, but with the gods\nin this manner. First (he cuts those) of the thumbs--for in human (practice)\nthose of the little fingers (are cut) first, but with the gods in this manner.\n\n3:1:2:55\\. He first passes (the comb) through his right whisker--for in human\n(practice they comb) first the left whisker, but with the gods in this manner.\n\n3:1:2:66\\. His right whisker he moistens first, with the text, 'May these\ndivine waters be propitious\n\np. 7\n\nunto me! The reason why he says, 'May these divine waters be propitious unto\nme,' is this: the waters are a thunderbolt, for the waters are indeed a\nthunderbolt; hence wherever these waters flow they produce a hollow, and\nwhatever they come near that they destroy (lit. burn up). Hereby, then, he\nappeases that same thunderbolt; and thus appeased, that thunderbolt does not\ninjure him. This is why he says, 'May these divine waters be propitious unto\nme!'\n\n3:1:2:77\\. Thereupon he lays a stalk of sacrificial grass on (the hair of the\nwhisker), with the text, 'O plant, protect me!' For the razor is a\nthunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the razor, does not injure him.\nThereto he applies the razor, with the text, 'O knife, injure him not!' for\nthe razor is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the razor, does not\ninjure him.\n\n3:1:2:88\\. Having cut off (part of the stalk and hair), he throws it into the\nvessel of water. Silently he moistens the left whisker; silently he lays the\nstalk of grass on it; and having silently applied the razor thereto and cut\nthrough (it and the hair), he throws them into the vessel of water.\n\n3:1:2:99\\. He then hands the razor to the barber, and the latter shaves off\nthe hair and beard. When he has shaved the hair and beard 1,--\n\np. 8\n\n3:1:2:1010\\. He bathes. For impure, indeed, is man: he is foul 1 within, in\nthat he speaks untruth;--and water is pure: he thinks, 'May I be consecrated,\nafter becoming pure;'--and water is cleansing: he thinks, 'May I become\nconsecrated after being cleansed!' This is the reason why he bathes.\n\n3:1:2:1111\\. He bathes, with the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 2; Rig-veda X, 17, 10),\n'May the waters, the mothers, cleanse us!' whereby he says, 'May they cleanse\n2!' 'May the purifiers of ghee purify us with (heavenly) ghee!' For he,\nindeed, is thoroughly purified whom they have purified with ghee 3:\naccordingly he says, 'May the purifiers of ghee purify us with ghee!'--'For\nthey, the divine, take away all taint;' now 'all' means 'every,' and 'taint'\nmeans what is impure; for they do take away from him every impurity: therefore\nhe says, 'For they, the divine, take away all taint.'\n\n3:1:2:1212\\. He steps out (from the water) towards the north-east 4, with the\ntext, 'Cleansed and pure\n\np. 9\n\n[paragraph continues] I go forth from them;' for cleansed and pure he indeed\ngoes forth from them.\n\n3:1:2:1313\\. He then puts on a (linen) garment, for completeness' sake: it is\nindeed his own skin he thereby puts on himself. Now that same skin which\nbelongs to the cow was originally on man.\n\n3:1:2:1414\\. The gods spake, 'Verily, the cow supports everything here (on\nearth); come, let us put on the cow that skin which is now on man: therewith\nshe will be able to endure rain and cold and heat.'\n\n3:1:2:1515\\. Accordingly, having flayed man, they put that skin on the cow,\nand therewith she now endures rain and cold and heat.\n\n3:1:2:1616\\. For man was indeed flayed; and hence where-ever a stalk of grass\nor some other object cuts him, the blood trickles out. They then put that\nskin, the garment, on him; and for this reason none but man wears a garment,\nit having been put on him as his skin. Hence also one should take care to be\nproperly clad, so that he may be completely endued with his own skin. Hence\nalso people like to see even an ugly person properly clad, since he is endued\nwith his own skin.\n\n3:1:2:1717\\. Let him, then, not be naked in the presence of a cow. For the cow\nknows that she wears his skin, and runs away for fear lest he should take the\nskin from her. Hence also cows draw fondly near to one who is properly clad.\n\n3:1:2:1818\\. Now the woof of this cloth belongs to Agni, and the warp to Vayu\n1, the thrum to the Fathers,\n\np. 10\n\nthe fore-edge 1 to the snakes, the threads to the All-gods, and the meshes to\nthe asterisms. For thus indeed all the deities are concerned therein; and\nhence it is the garment of the consecrated.\n\n3:1:2:1919\\. Let it (if possible) be a new one 2, for the sake of unimpaired\nvigour. Let him (the Adhvaryu) tell (the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ) to beat it, in\norder that whatsoever part of it an unclean woman has spun or woven may become\nclean. And if it be a new one, let him sprinkle it with water, so that it\nbecome clean. Or let him be consecrated in one which is laid aside to be worn\n(daily) after bathing, without being soaked (in some sharp cleansing\nsubstance) 3.\n\n3:1:2:2020\\. He puts it round him, with the text, 'Thou art the covering 4 of\nconsecration and penance;' heretofore, indeed, this was the covering of him as\none unconsecrated, but now it is that of consecration and penance: hence he\nsays, 'thou art the covering of consecration and penance.' 'I put thee on, the\nkindly and auspicious;' whereby he means to say, 'I put thee on, the kindly\nand pleasing one;'--\n\np. 11\n\n[paragraph continues] 'fostering a fair appearance;' for evil indeed is that\nappearance which he has heretofore fostered while unconsecrated; but now (he\nfosters) a fair appearance: therefore he says, 'fostering a fair appearance.'\n\n3:1:2:2121\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then makes him enter the hall. Let him not eat\n(the flesh) of either the cow or the ox; for the cow and the ox doubtless\nsupport everything here on earth. The gods spake, 'Verily, the cow and the ox\nsupport everything here: come, let us bestow on the cow and the ox whatever\nvigour belongs to other species 1!' Accordingly they bestowed on the cow and\nthe ox whatever vigour belonged to other species (of animals); and therefore\nthe cow and the ox eat most. Hence, were one to eat (the flesh) of an ox or a\ncow, there would be, as it were, an eating of everything, or, as it were, a\ngoing on to the end (or, to destruction). Such a one indeed would be likely to\nbe born (again) as a strange being, (as one of whom there is) evil report,\nsuch as 'he has expelled an embryo from a woman,' 'he has committed a sin 2;'\nlet him therefore not eat (the flesh) of the cow and the ox. Nevertheless Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said, 'I, for one, eat it, provided that it is tender.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[5:1](sbe2604.htm#fr_29) The rite described in the following paragraphs is\ncalled apsudiksha, or 'consecration in water.'\n\n[6:1](sbe2604.htm#fr_30) It is to be square and covered in on all sides with\nmats, and with a door on the east side. Katy. VII, I, 25 scholl.\n\n[7:1](sbe2604.htm#fr_31) The text has, when he shaves (vapati) the hair and\nbeard [when he shaves himself (vapate), K.] he bathes.' According to this it\nwould seem that he does not bathe unless he shaves (?). See, however, Katy.\nVII, 2, 22, where the shaving is said to be optional, but not so, according to\nthe commentary, the bathing. There seems also to be some doubt as to where the\nbathing is to take place. While, according to Karka, the sacrificer is to\nbathe in the vessel of water in the tent; according to other authorities he is\nto p. 8 do so in some tank, or other kind of bathing-place of standing water.\nCf. Taitt. S. VI, 1, 1, tirthe snati; tirtham eva samananam bhavati.\n\n[8:1](sbe2604.htm#fr_32) I now take puti (with Dr. Lindner) in the sense of\n'foul, filthy, fetid,' and would correct the passage (I, 1, 1, 1) accordingly.\nProfessor Ludwig (Gottinger Gel. Anz. 1883, p. 49) proposes to take puti in\nthe sense of 'pure,' both here and in I, 1, 1, 1.\n\n[8:2](sbe2604.htm#fr_33) The Ka _n_ va recension has the better reading, 'For\nthey, indeed, now cleanse him when he bathes.' According to Taitt. S. VI, 1,\n1, 3, he also sips (a _s_ nati) some water with the view of internal\npurification.\n\n[8:3](sbe2604.htm#fr_34) Lit. 'for that indeed is well purified, whom they\npurified (i.e. when they purify anybody) with ghee.' The imperfect is rather\nstrange. See also [III, 1, 3, 22](sbe2605.htm#3:1:3:22). The Ka _n_ vas read,\n'For that, indeed, is well purified what is purified (yad puyate) with ghee.'\n\n[8:4](sbe2604.htm#fr_35) Pra\xe1\xb9\x85 ivoda\xe1\xb9\x85 = uttarapurvardham, Katy. VII, 2, 15,\ni.e. 'towards the north with. a slight turn to the east.' Dr. Lindner takes\n'uda\xe1\xb9\x85' p. 9 as meant to explain the preposition 'ud.' This, however, does not\naccount for the 'iva.'\n\n[9:1](sbe2604.htm#fr_36) Agne _h_ paryaso bhavati, vayor anu _kh_ ado (?). The\nBlack Ya _g_ us p. 10 (T. S. VI, 1, 1) reads, agnes tushadhanam ( _s_\nalakopadhana _m_ tusha _h_ , (tatra tantunam pura _n_ a _m_ tushadhanam;\nSay.), vayor vatapanam vayuna _s_ osha _n_ a _m_ vatapanam, S.). The warp (pra\n_k_ inatana) and woof (otu), on the other hand, are by the Black Ya _g_ us\nascribed to the \xc3\x82dityas and Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ respectively.\n\n[10:1](sbe2604.htm#fr_37) Praghata, apparently the closely-woven part at both\nends of the cloth from whence the loose threads of the nivi, or unwoven fringe\n(thrum), come out. The Black Ya _g_ us ascribes it to the plants.\n\n[10:2](sbe2604.htm#fr_38) Literally, 'unbeaten (ahata), unwashed.'\n\n[10:3](sbe2604.htm#fr_39) That is to say, if it be not a new garment, it\nshould be one that has not been washed by a washerman (with mautra, &c.), but\nworn daily after bathing.\n\n[10:4](sbe2604.htm#fr_40) Or, outward form, tanu. Its meaning sometimes comes\nvery near to that of 'skin,' assigned to it by the lexicographers. Cf. [III,\n2, 2, 20](sbe2608.htm#3:2:2:20); [4, 3, 9](sbe2617.htm#3:4:3:9).\n\n[11:1](sbe2604.htm#fr_41) Vayasam, cf. [III, 3, 3, 3](sbe2613.htm#3:3:3:3).\nThe Ka _n_ va rec. has 'yad anyesha _m_ vayasa _m_ virya _m_ yad anyesham pa\n_s_ unam.'\n\n[11:2](sbe2604.htm#fr_42) A different translation of this passage is proposed\nby Professor Delbruck (Synt. Forsch. III, p. 25); but the Ka _n_ va text (sa\nta _m_ he _s_ varo 'dbhutam abhi _g_ anitor _g_ ayaya va garbha _m_ niravadhid\nyad yeti tad u hova _k_ a) shows that we have here, as frequently, to supply i\n_s_ vara _h_ to the infinitive in tos. The Ka _n_ va yad va ('or some such\nthing') would also seem to indicate that we ought to translate:--(as of one of\nwhom) there is evil report: 'he has committed some such (iti) sin as the\nproducing of abortion.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 3.
