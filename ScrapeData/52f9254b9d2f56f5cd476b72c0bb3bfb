In the "Awakening to the Self," this is hardly an\nimpediment, as the expression of this excellent poem is so perfect and\nuniversal; nor is there any great impediment in the first part of the "Crest\nJewel of Wisdom," which has been translated under the title "First Steps on\nthe Path." But further on in the "Crest Jewel," this is not the case. It\nbecomes more strict and technical in meaning; and without precise definitions,\nmuch is hardly intelligible. But in the "Crest Jewel" itself these definitions\nare not always to be found. What is to be done then, if we really want to\nunderstand the Teacher precisely?\n\nHappily \xc5\x9aankara has left us a Key in his own work, the "Awakening to Reality,"\nwhere nearly every special word of his philosophy is exactly defined. We have\nonly to try to find the best English translation of his definitions, and we\nshall have a clear clue and outline to the larger work, the "Crest Jewel,"\nand, indeed, to the whole of \xc5\x9aankara\'s philosophy.\n\nOne thing must be remembered. This "Awakening to Reality" is what we have\ncalled it--a catechism. And in a catechism we can hardly expect the perfect\n\np. 118\n\npoetical form and splendid imagery of works like the "Awakening to the Self."\nWhat we shall find, is lucidity, accuracy, grasp, coherence; but not poetical\nbeauty. Thus is begun:\n\n### THE AWAKENING TO REALITY\n\n### I\n\nTo the Master, the World-Soul, the Master of seekers for union, obeisance; to\nthe teacher, the giver of wisdom. To fulfill love for those who would be free,\nthis Awakening to Reality is addressed to them.\n\n### THE FOUR PERFECTIONS\n\nWe shall tell of the way of discerning reality, the perfection of freedom, for\nthose who are fitted by possessing the Four Perfections.\n\nWhat are the Four Perfections?\n\n\\--The Discerning between lasting and unlasting things; No Rage for enjoying\nthe fruit of works, either here or there; the Six Graces that follow Peace;\nand then the Longing to be free.\n\nWhat is the Discerning between lasting and unlasting things?\n\n\\--The one lasting thing is the Eternal; all, apart from it, is unlasting.\n\nWhat is No Rage?\n\n\\--A lack of longing for enjoyments here and in the heaven-world.\n\nWhat is possession of the Perfections that follow Peace?\n\np. 119\n\n\\--Peace; Self-Control; Steadiness; Sturdiness; Confidence; Intentness.\n\nWhat is Peace?\n\n\\--A firm hold on emotion.\n\nWhat is Self-Control?\n\n\\--A firm hold on the lust of the eyes and the outward powers.\n\nWhat is Steadiness?\n\n\\--A following out of one\'s own genius.\n\nWhat is Sturdiness?\n\n\\--A readiness to bear opposing forces, like cold and heat, pleasure and pain.\n\nWhat is Confidence?\n\n\\--Confidence is a reliance on the Voice of the Teacher and Final Wisdom.\n\nWhat is Intentness?\n\n\\--One-pointedness of the imagination.\n\nWhat is the Longing to be free?\n\n\\--It is the longing: "That Freedom may be mine."\n\n### THE DISCERNING OF REALITY,\n\nThese are the Four Perfections. Through these, men are fitted to discern\nReality.\n\nWhat is the Discerning of Reality?\n\n\\--It is this: the Self is real; other than it, all is fancy.\n\n### SELF, VESTURES, VEILS, MODES\n\nWhat is the Self?\n\n\\--He who stands apart from the Physical, the Emotional, and the Causal\nVestures; who is beyond the five\n\np. 120\n\n[paragraph continues] Veils; who is witness of the three Modes; whose own\nnature is Being, Consciousness, Bliss--this is the Self.\n\n### THE THREE VESTURES\n\nWhat is the Physical Vesture?\n\n\\--Being formed of the five creatures fivefolded, born through works, it is\nthe house where opposing forces like pleasure and pain are enjoyed; having,\nthese six accidents: it is, is born, grows, turns the corner, declines,\nperishes; such is the Physical Vesture.\n\nWhat is the Emotional Vesture?\n\n\\--Being formed of the five creatures not fivefolded, born through works, the\nperfection of the enjoyment of opposing forces like pleasure and pain,\nexisting with its seventeen phases: the five powers of knowing; the five\npowers of doing; the five lives; emotion, one; the soul, one; this is the\nEmotional Vesture.\n\nThe five powers of knowing are: Hearing, Touch, Sight, Taste, Smell. Hearing\'s\nradiation is Space; Touch\'s, Air; Sight\'s, the Sun; Smell\'s, the Twin\nPhysicians; these are the powers of knowing.\n\nHearing\'s business is the seizing of sounds; Touch\'s business, the seizing of\ncontacts; Sight\'s business, the seizing of forms; Taste\'s business, the\nseizing of tastes; Smell\'s business, the seizing Of odors.\n\nThe five powers of doing are: Voice, Hands, Feet, Putting-forth, Generating.\nVoice\'s radiation is the Tongue of Flame; Hands\', the Master; Feet\'s, the\nPervader; Putting-forth\'s, Death; Generating\'s, the Lord\n\np. 121\n\nof Beings; thus the radiations of the powers of doing. Voice\'s business is\nspeaking; Hands\' business is grasping things; Feet\'s business is going;\nPutting-forth\'s business is removing waste; Generating\'s business is physical\nenjoying.\n\nWhat is the Causal Vesture?\n\n\\--Being formed through ineffable, beginningless unwisdom, it is the Substance\nand Cause of the two Vestures; though unknowing as to its own nature, it is\nyet in nature unerring; this is the Causal Vesture.\n\n### THE THREE MODES\n\nWhat are the Three Modes?\n\n\\--The Modes of Waking, Dreaming, Dreamlessness.\n\nWhat is the Mode, Waking?\n\n\\--It is where knowledge comes through Hearing and the other knowing powers,\nwhose business is sound and the other perceptions; this is the Waking Mode.\n\nWhen attributing itself to the Physical Vesture, the Self is called the\nPervading.\n\nThen what is the Mode, Dreaming?\n\n\\--The world that presents itself in rest, generated by impressions of what\nhas been seen and heard in the Mode, Waking, is the Mode, Dreaming.\n\nWhen attributing itself to the Emotional Vesture, the Self is called the\nRadiant.\n\nWhat then is the Mode, Dreamlessness?\n\n\\--The sense that I perceive outwardly nothing at all, that rest is joyfully\nenjoyed by me, this is the Mode, Dreamlessness.\n\np. 122\n\nWhen attributing itself to the Causal Vesture, the Self is called the\nIntuitional.\n\n### THE FIVE VEILS\n\nWhat are the Five Veils?\n\n\\--The Food-formed; the Life-formed; the Emotion-formed; the Knowledge-formed;\nthe Bliss-formed.\n\nWhat is the Food-formed?\n\n\\--Coming into being through the essence of food, getting its growth through\nthe essence of food, in the food-formed world it is again dispersed, this is\nthe Food-formed Veil--the Physical Vesture.\n\nWhat is the Life-formed?\n\n\\--The Forward-life and the four other Lives, Voice and the four other powers\nof doing; these are the Life-formed.\n\nWhat is the Emotion-formed Veil?\n\n\\--Emotion, joining itself to the five powers of knowing--this is the Emotion-\nformed Veil.\n\nWhat is the Knowledge-formed?\n\n\\--The Soul, joining itself to the five powers of knowing--this is the\nKnowledge-formed Veil.\n\nWhat is the Bliss-formed?\n\n\\--This verily is the Substance not quite pure because of the unwisdom that\ngives birth to the Causal Vesture; in it are founded all joys; this is the\nBliss-formed Veil.\n\nThus the Five Veils.\n\nBy saying: "Mine are the lives; mine is emotion; mine is the soul; mine is the\nwisdom"; these are recognized as possessions, And just as a bracelet, a\nnecklace,\n\np. 123\n\na house and such things separated from one\'s self, are recognized as\npossessions, so the Five Veils and the Vestures, recognized as possessions,\nare not the Self (the Possessor).\n\nWhat then, is the Self?\n\n\\--It is that whose own-nature is Being, Consciousness, Bliss.\n\nWhat is Being?\n\n\\--What stands through the Three Times (Present, Past, Future)--this is Being.\n\nWhat is Consciousness?\n\n\\--The own-nature of Perceiving.\n\nWhat is Bliss?\n\n\\--The own-nature of joy.\n\nThus let a man know that the own-nature of his own Self is Being,\nConsciousness, Bliss.\n\n### EXPLANATORY BY CHARLES JOHNSTON\n\nThis "Awakening to Reality" is a summary of an intuition of the world, a\nsolution of the universe. Only those who have certain mental and moral\nendowments are ripe for the understanding of such a solution of the world.\nBriefly, these endowments are: wisdom and will. The solution reached is--the\nreal Self of every man is the Eternal. This Self is inwardly beginningless,\nendless, immortal. But outwardly it becomes manifest as three lesser selves,\neach with its own vesture, its own world.\n\nLowest of these is the physical self, the "Pervading"; with its physical\nVesture, in the Waking world.\n\np. 124\n\nNext, the emotional self, the "Radiant," with its emotional Vesture, in the\nDreaming world.\n\nHighest, the causal self, the "Intuitional," with its causal Vesture, in the\nDreamless world. It has existence apart from the Eternal, owing only to the\nthin veil of illusion, which hides the identity of the One with the All. Thus,\nas to its own nature, it is unknowing; for, while believing itself One, it is\nreally All. But for all other things it is unerring, for its close proximity\nto, and real oneness with, the Eternal, give it the inner sense of the\ntrueness of things that is all wisdom. This is "the Seer who ordained all\nfitly through the ages."\n\nIn the Physical Vesture adheres one Veil; in the Emotional Vesture three--the\nvital, the emotional, the moral;--in the Causal, again one.\n\nThere is a great difficulty in finding a fit word for the term we have\ntranslated "radiation." What is meant is the power--personified, almost\npersonal--conceived to be the "regent" or "deity" of the field in which each\nmode of perception and action finds its expansion. A closely analogous phrase\nwould be, for instance, "the Prince of the Powers of the Air," who would thus\nbe the "regent" or "deity" of the powers of touch, and, in morals, the "lusts\nof the flesh."\n\nThis is, of course, mythology: a mythical representation of an actual truth,\nvery difficult to represent otherwise than mythologically.\n\nBut in the conclusion of the matter there is no difficulty. It is, that a man\nshall know the own-nature of his own Self to be Being, Consciousness, Bliss;\nor, in other words, Eternal, Wisdom, Love.\n\np. 125\n\n### II\n\nWe shall speak now of the way the four-and-twenty natures are developed.\n\n### THE PRIMITIVE SEVEN\n\nDwelling together with the Evolver in glamor, who is the very self of the\nthree potencies: substance, force, and space.  \nFrom this glamor, shining ether came forth.  \nFrom shining ether, breath came forth.  \nFrom breath, fire came forth.  \nFrom fire, the waters came forth.  \nFrom the waters, earth came forth.\n\n### THEIR SUBSTANTIAL PARTS\n\nNow, among these five natures:  \nFrom the substantial part of shining ether, the power of hearing came forth.  \nFrom the substantial part of breath, the power of touch came forth.  \nFrom the substantial part of fire, the power of seeing came forth.  \nFrom the substantial part of the waters, the power of taste came forth.  \nFrom the substantial part of earth, the power of smelling came forth.  \nFrom the united substantial parts of these five natures, the inner powers--\nmind, soul, self-assertion, imagination--came forth.\n\np. 126\n\nMind is the very self of intending and doubting.  \nSoul is the very self of affirmation.  \nSelf-assertion is the very self of attributing selfhood.  \nImagination is the very self of image-making.\n\nThe regent of mind is the Moon.  \nThe regent of soul is the Evolver.  \nThe regent of self-assertion is the Transformer.  \nThe regent of imagination is the Pervader.\n\n### THEIR FORCEFUL PARTS\n\nNow, among these five natures:  \nFrom the forceful part of shining ether, the power of voice came forth.  \nFrom the forceful part of breath, the power of handling came forth.  \nFrom the forceful part of fire, the power of moving came forth.  \nFrom the forceful part of the waters, the power of engendering came forth.  \nFrom the forceful part of earth, the power of extruding came forth.  \nFrom the united forceful parts of these natures, the five lives--the upward-\nlife, the forward-life, the uniting-life, the distributing-life, the downward-\nlife--came forth.\n\n### THEIR SPATIAL PARTS\n\nOf these five natures, from their spatial parts, the five-folded five elements\ncome forth.\n\nWhat is this five-folding?\n\nIt is this: taking the spatial parts of the five primitive\n\np. 127\n\nnatures--one part of each--these parts are each first divided in two; then one\nhalf of each part is left alone, on one side, while the other halves of each\nare each divided into four. Then to the half of each nature, is joined the\nfourth of the half [the eighth] of each of the other natures. And thus five-\nfolding is made.\n\nFrom these five primitive natures, thus five-folded, the physical vesture is\nformed. Hence the essential unity between the clod and the Evolving Egg.\n\n### THE LIFE AND THE LORD\n\nThere is an image of the Eternal, which attributes itself to the vestures, and\nis called the Life. And this Life, through the power of Nature, regards the\nLord as separate from itself.\n\nWhen wearing the disguise of Unwisdom, the Self is called the Life.\n\nWhen wearing the disguise of Glamor, the Self is called the Lord.\n\nThus, through the difference of their disguises, there is an appearance of\ndifference between the Life and the Lord. And as long as this appearance of\ndifference continues, so long will the revolving world of birth and death\ncontinue. For this reason the idea of the difference between the Life and the\nLord is not to be admitted.\n\nBut how can the idea of unity between the Self-assertive, little-knowing Life,\nand the selfless, all-knowing Lord, be accepted, according to the famous\nwords, _that thou art_ ; since the genius of these two, the Life and the Lord,\nis so opposite?\n\np. 128\n\nThis is not really so; for \'Life attributing itself to the physical and\nemotional vestures\' is only the verbal meaning of _thou_ ; while the real\nmeaning of _thou_ is (pure Consciousness, bare of all disguises, in dreamless\nlife.\'\n\nAnd so \'the Lord full of omniscience and power\' is but the verbal meaning of\n_that_ ; while the real meaning of _that_ is \'pure Consciousness stripped of\ndisguises.\'\n\nThus there is no contradiction in the unity of the Life and the Lord, since\nboth are pure Consciousness.\n\n### THE FREE-IN-LIFE\n\nAnd thus all beings in whom the idea of the eternal has been developed,\nthrough the words of wisdom and the true Teacher, are Free-in-life.\n\nWho is Free-in-life?\n\nJust as there is the firm belief that \'I am the body,\' \'I am a man,\' \'I am a\npriest,\' \'I am a serf,\' so he who possesses the firm conviction that \'I am\nneither priest nor serf nor man, but stainless Being, Consciousness, Bliss,\nthe Shining, the inner Master, Shining Wisdom,\' and knows this by direct\nperception, he is Free-in-life.\n\n### THE THREE MODES OF DEEDS\n\nThus by the direct knowledge that \'I am the Eternal,\' he is freed from all the\nbonds of his deeds.\n\nHow many modes of these \'deeds\' are there? If counted as \'deeds to come,\'\n\'deeds accumulated,\' and \'deeds entered on,\' there are three modes.\n\nThe pure and impure deeds that are done by the body\n\np. 129\n\nof the wise, after wisdom is won, are called \'deeds to come.\'\n\nAnd what of \'deeds accumulated\'? The deeds that are waiting to be done, sprung\nfrom seeds sown in endless myriads of births, are \'deeds accumulated.\'\n\nAnd what are \'deeds entered on\'? The deeds that give joy and sorrow here in\nthe world, in this vesture, are \'deeds entered on.\' Through experiencing them\nthey reach cessation; for the using-up of deeds entered on comes through\nexperiencing them. And \'deeds accumulated\' reach cessation through wisdom, the\nvery self of certainty that \'I am the Eternal.\' \'Deeds to come\' also reach\ncessation through wisdom. For, as water is not bound to the lotus-leaf, so\n\'deeds to come\' are not bound to the wise.\n\nFor those who praise and love and honor the wise, to them come the pure \'deeds\nto come\' of the wise. And those who blame and hate and attack the wise, to\nthem come all the unspeakable deeds, whose very self is impurity, of the wise\nman\'s \'deeds to come.\'\n\n### THE END\n\nThen the Knower of the Self, crossing over the circling world, even here\nenjoys the bliss of the Eternal. As the sacred books say: The Knower of the\nSelf crosses over sorrow.\n\nAnd the sacred traditions say: Whether he leave his mortal form in Benares or\nin a dog-keeper\'s hut, if he has gained wisdom, he is free, his limitations\nlaid aside.\n\n_Thus the Awakening to Reality is completed_.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: \xc5\x9aankara\'s Catechism](cjw18.htm)\n\n'
