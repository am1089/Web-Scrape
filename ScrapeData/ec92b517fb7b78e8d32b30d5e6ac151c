A Crow, who lived close by, had also built a house, but\nit was not such a good one, being only made of a few sticks laid one above\nanother on the top of a prickly pear hedge. The consequence was, that one day\nwhen there was an unusually heavy shower, the Crow's nest was washed away,\nwhile the Sparrow's was not at all injured.\n\nin this extremity the Crow and her mate went to the Sparrow, and said,\n'Sparrow, Sparrow, have pity on us, and give us shelter, for the wind blows,\nand the rain beats, and the prickly pear hedge thorns stick into our eyes.'\nBut the Sparrow answered, 'I am cooking the dinner, I cannot let you in now,\ncome again presently.' In a little while the Crows returned, and said,\n'Sparrow, Sparrow, have pity on us, and give us shelter, for the wind blows,\nand the rain beats, and the prickly pear hedge thorns stick into our eyes.'\nThe Sparrow answered, 'I 'm eating my dinner, I cannot let you in now, come\nagain presently.' The Crows flew away, but in a little while returned, and\ncried once more, 'Sparrow, Sparrow, have pity on us, and give us shelter, for\nthe wind blows, and the rain beats, and the prickly pear hedge thorns stick\ninto our eyes.' The Sparrow replied, 'I'm washing the dishes, I cannot let you\nin now, come again presently.' The Crows waited a while and then called out,\n'Sparrow, Sparrow, have pity on us, and give us shelter, for the wind blows,\nand the rain beats, and the prickly pear hedge thorns stick into our eyes.'\nBut the Sparrow would not let them in, she only answered, 'I 'm sweeping the\nfloor, I cannot let you in now, come again presently.' Next time the Crows\ncame and cried, 'Sparrow, Sparrow, have pity on us, and give us shelter, for\nthe wind blows, and the rain beats, and the prickly pear hedge thorns stick\ninto our eyes '--she answered, 'I 'm making the beds, I cannot let you in now,\ncome again presently.' So, on one pretence or another, she refused to help the\npoor birds. At last, when she and her children had had their dinner, and she\nhad prepared and put away the dinner for next day, and had put all the\nchildren to bed and gone to bed herself she cried to the Crows, 'You may come\nin now, and take shelter for the night' The Crows came in, but they were very\nvexed at having been kept out so long in the wind and the rain, and when the\nSparrow and all her family were asleep, the one said to the other, 'This\nselfish Sparrow had no pity on us, she gave us no dinner, and would not let us\nin, till she and all her children were comfortably in bed; let us punish her.'\nSo the two Crows took all the nice dinner the Sparrow had prepared for herself\nand her children to eat next day, and flew away with it.\n\n![](img/33.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XVI.
