S\xc2\x92ri S\xc2\x92uka said :-- O king! This great doubt arises in my mind how a man\ncan be free from desires and the rewards of their actions, when he lives in\nthe midst of this Samsara, that is all full of Maya? When even by the\nacquiring of wisdom of the S\xc2\x92astras and the capability to judge which is real\nand which is unreal, the delusion of the mind is not dispelled until one\nresorts to the practice of Yoga, how then can freedom from desires and\nliberation come to a householder? The darkness of a room is not destroyed by\nthe mere mention of lamp, light; so the wisdom acquired by reading the\nS\xc2\x92astras can never dispel the darkness of delusion that reigns in the inside\nof a man. O lion of kings! If one wants Mok _s_ a, one ought not to commit any\nact of revenge or injury or killing any being; how can this be possible to a\nhouseholder?\n\n\n\n5-17. Your desires to acquire wealth, to enjoy royal pleasures and to get\nvictory in battle have not yet subsided; how then can you be a Jivan mukta? O\nking! You consider yet a thief, thief and a saint, saint; you consider a man\nas your relative or other than that; these ideas have not vanished from you;\nhow then can you be called Videha? O king! You feel the pungent, bitter,\nastringent, sour tastes and the like; you feel good and bad rasas\nrespectively; you become glad when success comes to you and you feel sorrow\nwhen you happen to fail; and you experience the three states, waking,\ndreaming, and deep sleep as an ordinary man does, how then can you be called\nto attain the Turiya (fourth) state? May I ask :-- Whether you cherish this\nidea that all these infantries, cavalries, chariots, and that all these\nelephants are mine; I am the lord of all the wealth and things? Or whether you\ndo not cherish this idea? O king! I think you eat sweet and good things, and,\nat times, feel pleasure\n\n\n\np. 70\n\n\n\nand, at other times, feel pain! So, O king! How can you look on the garland of\nflowers and the snake as one and the same? O king! He who is a Muktapuru _s_ a\nconsiders a lump of earth, a piece of stone, and gold as of one and the same\nvalue; he considers everything to be the same \xc3\x82tman and does good to all the\nbeings. Whatever that may be, I do not find any pleasure at present with\nhouses, wife, etc., or with anything, in fact. What my heart\xc2\x92s desire is that\nI roam alone always without any desires in my heart. Therefore I like not to\nhave any companion; to be free from any attachment and to be peaceful, and\ncalm; I do not wish to accept anything from anybody; I will forego all\npleasures and pains from cold, warmth, etc., and I will sustain my life on\nroots, fruits, and leaves, obtained without any effort and will roam, as I\nlike, like a deer. When I have not got the least attachment to the household\nlife and when I am beyond all the attributes, what necessity have I then of\nhouse, wealth or a suitable wife? And when you think of various things with\nloving heart, and yet say that you are a Jivan mukta, that is nothing but a\nmere vanity of yours! O king! When you think and become anxious about your\nenemies, about your wealth or sometimes about your army, how then can you be\nsaid to be free from cares? What more can be said than the fact that many\nMunis, eating moderately and controlling their senses, and leading an\nanchorite's life, and knowing the unreality of the world, fall victims to the\nMaya!\n\n\n\n18-27. Then what need there is to talk of you? O king! know that the\nhereditary title \xc2\x93Videha\xc2\x94 to your line of kings indicates downright\ninsincerity; nothing can be other than this as the name \xc2\x93Vidya Dhara\xc2\x94 (holder\nof knowledge) is applied to an illiterate man; as the name \xc2\x93Divakara\xc2\x94 (sun) is\ngiven to a born-blind man, as the name \xc2\x93Lak _s_ midhara\xc2\x94 (holder of wealth) is\ngiven to even a poor man, as these names are quite useless to me. I have heard\nthat the kings of your family who were your predecessors were called \xc2\x93Videha\xc2\x94\nin name only and not in deed. O king! In your family there reigned a king\nnamed \xc2\x93Nimi.\xc2\x94 Once on a time that royal sage invited his Guru Va _s \xc2\x92_i _st_\nha to perform a sacrifice, when Va _s_ 'i _st_ ha said :-- \xc2\x93I am already\ninvited by Indra, the lord of the Devas, to perform his sacrifice; so O king!\nlet me first finish his work; I will then take up your work. Better go on\ncollecting the sacrificial materials till my that work is complete.\xc2\x94 Thus\nsaying, Va _s_ 'i _st_ ha went away to perform Indra's sacrifice; on the other\nhand, the royal sage Nimi selected another priest and made him his Guru and\nbegan his sacrifice. Hearing all this, Mahar _s_ i Va _s_ \xc2\x92i _st_ ha became\nangry and cursed him thus :-- \xc2\x93O forsaker of your Guru! For the crime of\nforsaking your Guru, let thy body be destroyed today!\xc2\x94 At this, the royal\nsage, too, cursed Va _s_ 'i _st_ ha in his turn \xc2\x93Let your body fall off also.\xc2\x94\nThen the bodies of both the\n\n\n\np. 71\n\n\n\npersons fell. But, O king! this curiousity came to my mind, how the royal\nsage, whose body fell before, cursed his own Guru afterwards.\n\n\n\n28-35. Janaka said :-- O Lord of Brahmins! what you have said is, in my\nopinion, all quite true; nothing is false. Still hear. Know what my most\nworshipful Guru Deva has spoken to me is, in fact, true (and nothing else).\nYou are now intending to quit the company of your father and go to the forest;\nwell and good! but even then you will undoubtedly have the company of deer,\netc.; see, also, that when the five elements, earth, water, air, etc., are\npresent, encompassing everywhere, how, then, can you expect to be free from\nall companions? So, O Muni! when you will have to think always of your food,\nhow, then, can you be said to be free from all cares? Again, even if you go to\nthe forest, you will have to think there also for your staff, deer skin, etc.;\nso you can take my case, too, of thinking of my kingdom, whether I think or\nnot, as your thinking of staff, deer skin, etc., your heart is tainted with\nVikalpa J\xc3\xb1an (knowledge of doubt, duality, etc.); and therefore you have come\nhere from a far-off country. But my heart is free from any such doubt and I am\nremaining quite cheerful here. O best of Brahmins! I have got no doubt\nwhatsoever on any point, and therefore I take my food and go to sleep with\ngreat pleasure. \xc2\x93I am not bound up by this world\xc2\x94 this idea gives me constant\nhappiness of the highest degree. But you consider that you are bound and\ntherefore you feel always constant pain. So leave off your idea that you are\nbound, and be happy. \xc2\x93This body is mine\xc2\x94 this knowledge leads to my bondage;\nand \xc2\x93This body is not mine\xc2\x94 this knowledge leads to freedom so know this\nverily that all this wealth, kingdom, etc., are not mine.\n\n\n\n36-45. Suta said :-- Hearing these words of the royal sage, S\xc2\x92uka Deva became\nexceedingly glad and pronounced \xc2\x93Sadhu\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Sadhu\xc2\x94 (true saint, indeed a true\nsaint, well said) and went away without any delay to the pleasant \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama of\nVyasa. Vyasa, too, seeing his son come back, became very glad and embraced him\nand took the smell of his head and asked about his welfare again and again.\nThen S\xc2\x92uka Deva, well conversant with the S\xc2\x92astras and ever ready in studying\nthe Vedas, sat by the side of his father, with an enlightened mind, in his\nlovely \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama and thinking of the state of the highsouled Janaka in his\nkingdom, began to feel the highest peace. Though S\xc2\x92uka adopted the path of\nYoga, yet he married the daughter of a Muni, named Pivari, very beautiful,\nfortunate, enhancing the glory of her father's family. Then were born first\nthe four sons named Krishna, Gauraprabha, Bhuri, and Devas'ruta out of the\nsperm of S\xc2\x92uka and the ovum of Pivari; and next a daughter was born named\nKirti of them. Vyasa's son S\xc2\x92uka, endowed with the fire of asceticism gave the\ndaughter Kirti in marriage in due time with the high-souled\n\n\n\np. 72\n\n\n\nAnuha, the son of Vibhraja. As time passed on, a son was born of the womb of\nKirti and the sperm of Anuha, a son who became the powerful king Brahmadatta,\nthe knower of Brahma and endowed with wealth and prosperity. Some time elapsed\nwhen Anuha, the son-in-law of S\xc2\x92uka Deva, getting from Narada the Mayavija and\nhighest knowledge of Yoga handed over his kingdom to his son and went to the\nhermitage of Vadarika and became liberated.\n\n\n\nThe Devar _s_ i Narada gave him the mantra, the vija of Maya; and by the\ninfluence of that mantra and by the grace of the Devi, the knowledge of the\nSupreme Brahma, arose in him without any obstacle and gave him liberation.\n\n\n\n46-51. On the other hand S\xc2\x92uka Deva, always averse to any company, left his\nfather and went to the beautiful mountain Kailas'a. He began to meditate on\nthe unmoving Brahma and thus remained there. After some time the highly\nenergetic S\xc2\x92uka Deva attained Siddhi (supernatural powers) Anima, Laghima,\netc., rose up high in the air from the top of the mountain and began to roam\nthere, and then he appeared like a second Sun. When S\xc2\x92uka arose from the peak,\nit severed into two and various ominous signs became visible. When S\xc2\x92uka Deva,\nappearing like a second Sun by the dazzling brilliancy of his body, suddenly\nvanished away like air and became diluted in the Paramatman, entering into\neverything and became invisible, then the Devar _s_ is began to chant hymns to\nhim. On the other hand, Vyasa Deva became very much distressed with the\nseparation from his son and cried out frequently \xc2\x93Oh, my son! Alas! my son\nWhere are you gone?\xc2\x94 and went to the summit of the mountain where S\xc2\x92uka did go\nand wept bitterly. Then S\xc2\x92uka Deva, who was then residing as the Paramatman,\nthe Internal controller of all the beings and with all the beings, knowing\nVyasa Deva as very much fatigued, distressed, and crying, spoke out as an echo\nfrom the mountains and trees thus :-- \xc2\x93O Father! There is no difference\nbetween you and me, considered in the light of \xc3\x82tman; then why are you weeping\nfor me?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n52-59. Even today the above echo is clearly heard (almost daily). Seeing Vyasa\nDeva grieved very much for the separation from his son and always crying \xc2\x93Oh!\nmy son! Oh! my son!\xc2\x94 Bhagavan Mahes'vara came there and consoled him saying \xc2\x93O\nVyasa Deva! your son is the foremost of the Yogis; he has attained the highest\nstate, so very rare to the ordinary persons that are not self controlled. So\ndo not be sorry any more. O Sinless One! when you have realised the Brahma-\ntattva, then you ought not to express any sorrow for your S\xc2\x92uka who is now\nstationed in that Brahman. Your fame is now unrivalled, only on account\n\n\n\np. 73\n\n\n\nof your having got a son like him.\xc2\x94 Vyasa Deva said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of the Devas!\nO Lord of the world! What am I to do now? My grief does not quit my heart\nanyhow or other. My eyes are as yet satisfied in seeing my son; they like\nstill to see the son.\xc2\x94 Hearing these sorrowful words of Vyasa, Bhagavan\nMahadeva said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni Sardula! I grant this boon to you that you will see\nthe form of your son abiding in shadow, very beautiful, by the side of you. O\nDestroyer of enemies! Now abandon your grief by seeing that shadow form of\nyour son.\xc2\x94 When Bhagavan Mahes'vara said so, Vyasa began to see the bright\nshade form of his son. Granting thus the boon, Bhagavan Mahadeva vanished then\nand there. When He vanished away, Vyasa became very much distressed with\nsorrow for the bereavement of his son and returned with heavy heart to his own\nhermitage.\n\n\n\nThus ends the nineteenth chapter of the first Skandha on the description of\nthe marriage of S\xc2\x92uka in the Mahapura _n_ a S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 20](bk01ch20.htm)\n\n"
