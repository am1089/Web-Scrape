And on account of the equality of names and forms there is no\ncontradiction (to the eternity of the word of the Veda) in the renovation (of\nthe world); as is seen from _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti.\n\nIf--the purvapakshin resumes--the individual gods and so on did, like the\nindividual animals, originate and pass away in an unbroken succession so that\nthere would be no break of the course of practical existence including\ndenominations, things denominated and agents denominating; the connexion\n(between word and thing) would be eternal, and the objection as to a\ncontradiction with reference to the word (raised in Sutra 27) would thereby be\nrefuted. But if, as _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti declare, the whole threefold\n\np. 212\n\nworld periodically divests itself of name and form, and is entirely dissolved\n(at the end of a kalpa), and is after that produced anew; how can the\ncontradiction be considered to have been removed?\n\nTo this we reply: 'On account of the sameness of name and form.'--Even then\nthe beginninglessness of the world will have to be admitted (a point which the\nteacher will prove later on: II, 1, 36). And in the beginningless sa _m_ sara\nwe have to look on the (relative) beginning, and the dissolution connected\nwith a new kalpa in the same light in which we look on the sleeping and waking\nstates, which, although in them according to Scripture (a kind of) dissolution\nand origination take place, do not give rise to any contradiction, since in\nthe later waking state (subsequent to the state of sleep) the practical\nexistence is carried on just as in the former one. That in the sleeping and\nthe waking states dissolution and origination take place is stated Kaush. Up.\nIII, 3, 'When a man being asleep sees no dream whatever he becomes one with\nthat pra _n_ a alone. Then speech goes to him with all names, the eye with all\nforms, the ear with all sounds, the mind with all thoughts. And when he awakes\nthen, as from a burning fire, sparks proceed in all directions, thus from that\nSelf the pra _n_ as proceed, each towards its place; from the pra _n_ as the\ngods, from the gods the worlds.'\n\nWell, the purvapakshin resumes, it may be that no contradiction arises in the\ncase of sleep, as during the sleep of one person the practical existence of\nother persons suffers no interruption, and as the sleeping person himself when\nwaking from sleep may resume the very same form of practical existence which\nwas his previously to his sleep. The case of a mahapralaya (i. e. a general\nannihilation of the world) is however a different one, as then the entire\ncurrent of practical existence is interrupted, and the form of existence of a\nprevious kalpa can be resumed in a subsequent kalpa no more than an individual\ncan resume that form of existence which it enjoyed in a former birth.\n\nThis objection, we reply, is not valid. For although a mahapralaya does cut\nshort the entire current of practical\n\np. 213\n\nexistence, yet, by the favour of the highest Lord, the Lords (i _s_ vara),\nsuch as Hira _n_ yagarbha and so on, may continue the same form of existence\nwhich belonged to them in the preceding kalpa. Although ordinary animated\nbeings do not, as we see, resume that form of existence which belonged to them\nin a former birth; still we cannot judge of the Lords as we do of ordinary\nbeings. For as in the series of beings which descends from man to blades of\ngrass a successive diminution of knowledge, power, and so on, is observed--\nalthough they all have the common attribute of being animated--so in the\nascending series extending from man up to Hira _n_ yagarbha, a gradually\nincreasing manifestation of knowledge, power, &c. takes place; a circumstance\nwhich _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti mention in many places, and which it is\nimpossible to deny. On that account it may very well be the case that the\nLords, such as Hira _n_ yagarbha and so on, who in a past kalpa were\ndistinguished by superior knowledge and power of action, and who again appear\nin the present kalpa, do, if favoured by the highest Lord, continue (in the\npresent kalpa) the same kind of existence which they enjoyed in the preceding\nkalpa; just as a man who rises from sleep continues the same form of existence\nwhich he enjoyed previously to his sleep. Thus Scripture also declares, 'He\nwho first creates Brahman (Hira _n_ yagarbha) and delivers the Vedas to him,\nto that God who is the light of his own thoughts, I, seeking for release, go\nfor refuge' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 18). _S_ aunaka and others moreover declare (in\nthe Anukrama _n_ is of the Veda) that the ten books (of the _Ri_ g-veda) were\nseen by Madhu _kkh_ andas and other _ri_ shis. 1And, similarly, Sm _ri_ ti\ntells us, for every Veda, of men of exalted mental vision ( _ri_ shis) who\n'saw' the subdivisions of their respective Vedas, such as ka _nd_ as and so\non. Scripture also declares that the performance of the sacrificial action by\nmeans of the mantra is to be preceded by the knowledge of the _ri_ shi and so\non, 'He who makes another person sacrifice or read by means of a mantra of\nwhich he\n\np. 214\n\ndoes not know the _ri_ shi, the metre, the divinity, and the Brahma _n_ a,\nruns against a post, falls into a pit 1, &c. &c., therefore one must know all\nthose matters for each mantra' (\xc3\x82rsheya Brahma _n_ a, first section).--\nMoreover, religious duty is enjoined and its opposite is forbidden, in order\nthat the animate beings may obtain pleasure and escape pain. Desire and\naversion have for their objects pleasure and pain, known either from\nexperience or from Scripture, and do not aim at anything of a different\nnature. As therefore each new creation is (nothing but) the result of the\nreligious merit and demerit (of the animated beings of the preceding\ncreation), it is produced with a nature resembling that of the preceding\ncreation. Thus Sm _ri_ ti also declares, 'To whatever actions certain of these\n(animated beings) had turned in a former creation, to the same they turn when\ncreated again and again. Whether those actions were harmful or harmless,\ngentle or cruel, right or wrong, true or untrue, influenced by them they\nproceed; hence a certain person delights in actions of a certain kind.'--\nMoreover, this world when being dissolved (in a mahapralaya) is dissolved to\nthat extent only that the potentiality ( _s_ akti) of the world remains, and\n(when it is produced again) it is produced from the root of that potentiality;\notherwise we should have to admit an effect without a cause. Nor have we the\nright to assume potentialities of different kind (for the different periods of\nthe world). Hence, although the series of worlds from the earth upwards, and\nthe series of different classes of animate beings such as gods, animals, and\nmen, and the different conditions based on caste, a _s_ rama, religious duty\nand fruit (of works), although all these we say are again and again\ninterrupted and thereupon produced anew; we yet have to understand that they\nare, in the beginningless sa _m_ sara, subject to a certain determinateness\nanalogous to the determinateness governing the connexion between the senses\nand their objects. For it is impossible to imagine that the relation of senses\nand sense-objects should be a different one in different creations, so\n\np. 215\n\nthat, for instance, in some new creation a sixth sense and a corresponding\nsixth sense-object should manifest themselves. As, therefore, the phenomenal\nworld is the same in all kalpas and as the Lords are able to continue their\nprevious forms of existence, there manifest themselves, in each new creation,\nindividuals bearing the same names and forms as the individuals of the\npreceding creations, and, owing to this equality of names and forms, the\nadmitted periodical renovations of the world in the form of general pralayas\nand general creations do not conflict with the authoritativeness of the word\nof the Veda. The permanent identity of names and forms is declared in _S_ ruti\nas well as Sm _ri_ ti; compare, for instance, _Ri_ k. Sa _m_ h. X, 190, 3, 'As\nformerly the creator ordered sun and moon, and the sky, and the air, and the\nheavenly world;' which passage means that the highest Lord arranged at the\nbeginning of the present kalpa the entire world with sun and moon, and so on,\njust as it had been arranged in the preceding kalpa. Compare also Taitt.\nBrahm. III, 1, 4, 1, 'Agni desired: May I become the consumer of the food of\nthe gods; for that end he offered a cake on eight potsherds to Agni and the K\n_ri_ ttikas.' This passage, which forms part of the injunction of the ish _t_\ni to the Nakshatras, declares equality of name and form connecting the Agni\nwho offered and the Agni to whom he offered 1.\n\nSm _ri_ ti also contains similar statements to be quoted here; so, for\ninstance, 'Whatever were the names of the _ri_ shis and their powers to see\nthe Vedas, the same the Unborn one again gives to them when they are produced\nafresh at the end of the night (the mahapralaya). As the various signs of the\nseasons return in succession in their due time, thus the same beings again\nappear in the different yugas. And of whatever individuality the gods of the\n\np. 216\n\npast ages were, equal to them are the present gods in name and form.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[213:1](sbe34099.htm#fr_208) Which circumstance proves that exalted knowledge\nappertains not only to Hira _n_ yagarbha, but to many beings.\n\n[214:1](sbe34099.htm#fr_209) Viz. naraka, the commentaries say.\n\n[215:1](sbe34099.htm#fr_210) Asmin kalpe sarvesham pra _n_ inam dahapakapraka\n_s_ akari yo#yam agnir d _ris_ yate so#yam agni _h_ purvasmin kalpe manushya\n_h_ san devatvapadaprapaka _m_ karmanush _th_ ayasmin kalpa eta _g_ _g_ anma\nlabdhavan ata _h_ purvasmin kalpe sa manushyo bhavini _m_ sa _mg \xc3\xb1_am a _sri_\ntyagnir iti vyapadi _s_ yate.--Saya _n_ a on the quoted passage.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 31](sbe34100.htm)\n\n"
