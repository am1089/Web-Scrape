He then pours out jarfuls of water,--for the gods then said,\n'Meditate ye ( _k_ etay)!' whereby they doubtless meant to say, 'Seek ye a\nlayer ( _k_ itim)!' Whilst meditating they saw the rain to be a (suitable)\nlayer, and put it on that (altar-site); and in like manner does this\n(Sacrificer) now put it thereon.\n\n7:2:4:22\\. Jarfuls of water are (poured out); for rain is water: it is rain he\nthereby bestows on it. With an udumbara jar (he pours them on): the\nsignificance of this has been told;--with a four-cornered one;--four quarters\nthere are: from all quarters he thus bestows rain thereon.\n\n7:2:4:33\\. Three jarfuls he pours out each time 1,--threefold is Agni: as\ngreat as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus bestows\nrain thereon.\n\n7:2:4:44\\. Twelve jarfuls of water he pours on the ploughed ground,--twelve\nmonths are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, by so much he thus bestows rain thereon.\n\np. 336\n\n7:2:4:55\\. On the ploughed ground he pours (water), whence it rains for (the\nbenefit of) the ploughed land. Now were he only to pour it on the ploughed\nground, and not on the unploughed, it would only rain for the ploughed land,\nnot for the unploughed. And were he only to pour it on the unploughed ground,\nand not on the ploughed, it would only rain for the unploughed land, and not\nfor the ploughed. He pours it both on the ploughed, and the unploughed,\nground; whence it rains both for the ploughed, and the unploughed, ground.\n\n7:2:4:66\\. Three (jarfuls) 1 he pours both on the ploughed, and on the\nunploughed, ground;--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much he thus bestows rain thereon.\n\n7:2:4:77\\. And, again, why he pours out jarfuls of water;--at that time the\ngods, being about to put him (Agni-Pra _g_ apati) together, in the first place\nput water into him; and in like manner does this one now, being about to put\nhim together, in the first place put water into him.\n\n7:2:4:88\\. Three jarfuls he pours out each time,--threefold is Agni: as large\nas Agni is, as large as is his measure, by so much he thus puts water into\nhim.\n\n7:2:4:99\\. Twelve jarfuls he pours on the ploughed ground,--twelve months are\na year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,\nby so much he thus puts water into him.\n\n7:2:4:1010\\. On the ploughed ground he pours it: he thereby puts water into\nthe vital airs. But were he to pour (water) only on the ploughed ground, and\n\np. 337\n\nnot on the unploughed, there would be water only in (the channels of) the\nvital airs, and not in the other (parts of the) body. And were he to pour\n(water) only on the unploughed ground, and not on the ploughed, there would be\nwater only in (the other parts of) the body, and not in the vital airs. He\npours it both on the ploughed, and the unploughed, ground, whence there is\nwater here both in (the channels of) the vital airs and in the body.\n\n7:2:4:1111\\. Three (jarfuls) he pours both on the ploughed, and on the\nunploughed, ground;--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much he thus puts water into him.\n\n7:2:4:1212\\. Fifteen jarfuls of water he pours out,--fifteenfold is the\nthunderbolt: by that fifteenfold thunderbolt of his he thus drives away all\nevil.\n\n7:2:4:1313\\. He then sows all (kinds of) herb (-seed);--for the gods then\nsaid, 'Meditate ye!' whereby doubtless they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!'\nwhilst meditating, they saw food to be a (suitable) layer, and put that on\n(or, into) him (Agni); and in like manner does this one now put it into him.\n\n7:2:4:1414\\. It is (seed) of all herbs,--all herbs means all food; he thus\nputs all (kinds of) food into him. Let him omit one of those kinds of food,\nand not eat thereof as long as he lives. By means of the udumbara jar (he sows\nthe seed): the significance of this has been explained;--with a four-cornered\none,--there are four quarters: from all quarters he thus puts food into him\n(Agni). He sows it with anush _t_ ubh (verses),--the Anush _t_ ubh (metre) is\nspeech, and by means of speech (the mouth 1) food is eaten.\n\np. 338\n\n7:2:4:1515\\. With three verses he sows each time 1,--threefold is Agni: as\ngreat as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts food\ninto him.\n\n7:2:4:1616\\. With twelve verses he sows on the ploughed ground,--twelve months\nare a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, with so much he thus puts food into him.\n\n7:2:4:1717\\. On the ploughed ground he sows, whence food ripens on ploughed\nground. Were he to sow only on the ploughed ground, and not on the unploughed,\nfood would only ripen on ploughed ground, not on unploughed; and were he to\nsow only on unploughed ground, and not on ploughed ground, food would only\nripen on unploughed ground, and not on ploughed ground. He sows on both the\nploughed, and the unploughed, ground: hence food ripens both on ploughed, and\non unploughed, ground.\n\n7:2:4:1818\\. With three (verses) he sows both on the ploughed, and on the\nunploughed, ground,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, by so much he thus puts food into him.\n\n7:2:4:1919\\. And, again, why he sows all (kinds of) herb (-seed),--the gods at\nthat time, being about to put him (Agni-Pra _g_ apati) together, in the first\nplace healed him by healing medicine; and in like manner does this one now,\nbeing about to put him together, first heal him with healing medicine.\n\n7:2:4:2020\\. It is (seed) of all herbs;--all herbs is the\n\np. 339\n\nsame as all (kinds of) medicine: by all (kinds of) healing medicine he thus\nheals him.\n\n7:2:4:2121\\. With three verses he sows each time,--threefold is Agni: as great\nas Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus heals him.\n\n7:2:4:2222\\. With twelve verses he sows on the ploughed ground,--twelve months\nare a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, with so much he thus heals him.\n\n7:2:4:2323\\. On the ploughed ground he sows: he thereby heals the vital airs.\nAnd were he to sow only on the ploughed ground, and not on the unploughed, he\nwould only heal the vital airs, and not the other (parts of the) body; and\nwere he to sow only on the unploughed, and not on the ploughed, ground, he\nwould only heal the body, and not the vital airs: he sows both on the\nploughed, and on the unploughed, ground; and thus he heals both the vital airs\nand the body.\n\n7:2:4:2424\\. With three (verses) he sows both on the ploughed, and on the\nunploughed, ground,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, with so much he thus heals him.\n\n7:2:4:2525\\. Fifteen jarfuls of water he pours out, and with fifteen verses he\nsows,--that makes thirty,--the Vira _g_ (metre) consists of thirty syllables,\nand the Vira _g_ (the far-shining, or far-ruling) is the whole food: the whole\nfood he thus puts into him.\n\n7:2:4:2626\\. [He sows, with Va _g_. S. XII, 75 seq.; _Ri_ k S. X, 97] 'The\nherbs first grown three ages before the gods 1,'--the gods doubtless are the\nseasons,\n\np. 340\n\nand from them those (herbs) used to grow thrice, in spring, in the rainy\nseason, and in the autumn;--'of the brown ones will I ponder,'--the brown one,\ndoubtless, is Soma, and the herbs are related to Soma, and the Purusha (Pra\n_g_ apati) is related to herbs 1;--'the hundred powers,'--inasmuch as he here\nlives a hundred (years), and has a hundred merits, and a hundred energies,\nthere are in him those hundred powers;--'and seven,'--he thereby speaks of\nthose seven vital airs in the head.\n\n7:2:4:2727\\. 'Yours, O Mother, are a hundred powers, and yours a thousand\ngrowths,'--inasmuch as (the plants) here are shooting out a hundredfold, and a\nthousandfold;--'Ye of a hundred virtues, render ye free from sickness this one\nof mine!' that is, him whom I am now healing.\n\n7:2:4:2828\\. These (verses) 2 have one and the same explanation\n\np. 341\n\nwith regard to this (Agni-Pra _g_ apati),how he may heal him, and preserve\nhim. They are anush _t_ ubh verses,--the Anush _t_ ubh is speech, and speech\nis all healing medicine: by means of all healing medicine he thus heals him.\n\n7:2:4:2929\\. Now, then, regarding the defined and the undefined\n(ceremonies);--with prayer he yokes two oxen, silently the others; with prayer\nhe ploughs four furrows, silently the others; silently he puts on the grass-\nbush, with prayer he makes a libation thereon; silently he pours out the\njarfuls of water, with prayer he sows.\n\n7:2:4:3030\\. This Agni is Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is both the defined\nand the undefined, the limited and the\n\np. 342\n\nunlimited. Now whatever he does with prayer thereby he restores that form of\nhis which is defined, limited; and whatever he does silently, thereby he\nrestores that form of his which is undefined, unlimited,--verily, whosoever,\nknowing this, performs thus, restores this whole and complete Pra _g_ apati.\nThe outer forms are defined, and the inner ones are undefined; and Agni is the\nsame as an animal: hence the outer forms of the animal are defined, and the\ninner ones undefined.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[335:1](sbe4160.htm#fr_640) On every four of the sixteen furrows, in the order\nin which they have been ploughed, he is to empty three jarfuls of water,\nmaking altogether twelve jars of water.\n\n[336:1](sbe4160.htm#fr_641) These are additional three jarfuls poured over the\nwhole Agnikshetra, or site of the altar.\n\n[337:1](sbe4160.htm#fr_642) See [p. 200](sbe4134.htm#page_200), note\n[3](sbe4134.htm#fn_413).\n\n[338:1](sbe4160.htm#fr_643) The sowing of the seed is done after the manner of\nthe watering of the site, viz. so as to finish the sowing of every four\nfurrows with the completion of the muttering of three verses (Va _g_. S. XII,\n75-86); whereupon the remaining seed is scattered over the whole site with\nadditional three verses (87-89).\n\n[339:1](sbe4160.htm#fr_644) Thus the St. Petersburg dictionary; while\nProfessor Ludwig construes 'triyugam pura' together,--'the herbs first come\nfrom p. 340 the gods before the three ages;'--but is there any other example\nof 'pura' with the accusative? The author of the Brahma _n_ a, on the other\nhand, takes 'triyugam pura' as adverbs independent of each other,--'formerly\nat three periods.'\n\n[340:1](sbe4160.htm#fr_645) Or, consists of herbs.\n\n[340:2](sbe4160.htm#fr_646) That is, the two verses just explained, as well as\nthe remaining thirteen verses (Va _g_. S. XII, 77 seq.; _Ri_ k S. X, 97, 3\nseq.), viz.:--\n\n3\\. Rejoice ye at the plants, the full-budded, abounding in shoots: like\nvictorious mares, the herbs are eager to win (or, to save).\n\n4\\. As plants, O divine mothers, I call upon you: horse, and cow, and raiment\nwould I win, and thine own self, O Purusha!\n\n5\\. On the A _s_ vattha tree is your abode, on the Par _n_ a dwelling is made\nfor you: possessed of cattle shall ye be, when ye save the Purusha.\n\n6\\. Wherein the herbs have met together, even as the nobles in the assembly,\nthat priest is called physician, demon-killer, pain-remover.\n\n7\\. The (herb) rich in horses, the one rich in Soma, the p. 341 strengthening,\nmost powerful,--all herbs have I found for healthfulness to him (the Purusha).\n\n8\\. Forth rush the energies of the plants, like kine from the stable, eager to\nwin wealth, eager to win wealth, O Purusha!\n\n9\\. Strength-giving (ishk _ri_ ti) is the name of your mother, hence ye are\nhealing powers (nishk _ri_ ti): winged furrows ye are; what ye make sick, ye\nheal.\n\n10\\. All obstacles have they overcome, even as the thief the cow-pen; the\nherbs have expelled whatever defect of the body there was.\n\n11\\. When, to give strength, I take these herbs in my hand, the self of\nYakshman (consumption) perishes, as from the clutches of the living (? i.e.\nfrom death, Ludw.).\n\n12\\. Whose every limb, whose every joint ye, O herbs, flow through, from him\nye chase away (the demon) Yakshman,--mighty (he is) and, as it were, abiding\nin the core.\n\n13\\. Fly forth, O Yakshman; together with the garrulous jay; vanish with the\ngliding of the wind, with the whirlwind (?)!\n\n14\\. May one of you help the other, may ye lend help to one another! Of one\nmind, help ye forward this word of mine!\n\n15\\. Those bearing fruit, and those without fruit, the flowerless and the\nflowering, urged forward by B _ri_ haspati, may they preserve us from trouble!\n\nThe Va _g_. S. also gives the remaining verses of the hymn, which are not,\nhowever, required on the present occasion.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 3, 1. Third Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe4161.htm)\n\n"
