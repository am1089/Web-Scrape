Now the building of the house.\n\n2\\. Let him have his house built on an auspicious day.\n\n3 3. Into the pits (in which the posts shall be erected) he pours an oblation\nwith (the words), 'To the steady one, the earth-demon, svaha!'\n\n4 4. He erects the post.\n\n'This navel of the world I set up, a stream of wealth, promoting wealth. Here\nI erect a firm house; may it stand in peace, dropping ghee.\n\n'Rich in horses and cows, rich in delight be set up, for the sake of great\nhappiness. To thee may the young calf cry, to thee the lowing cows, the milk-\ncows.\n\n'To thee (may) the young child (go), to thee the calf with its companions, to\nthee the cup of Parisrut, to thee (may they go) with pots of curds.\n\np. 346\n\n'The consort of Peace, the great one, beautifully attired\xc2\x97bestow on us, O\nblessed one, wealth and manly power, which may be rich in horses and cows,\nfull of sap like a tree's leaf. May our wealth increase here, clothing itself\nwith prospering'\xc2\x97with (these four Mantras) he approaches the four (posts).\n\n5\\. Having established the fire inside (the house), having made the Brahman\nsit down towards the south, having placed a water-pot to the north, and cooked\na mess of sacrificial food, he goes out (of the house), and standing near the\ndoor, he addresses the Brahman, 'Brahman, I enter (the house)!'\n\n6\\. When the Brahman has given his consent, he enters with (the formula), 'To\nright I advance, to luck I advance!'\n\n7 7. Having prepared \xc3\x82 _g_ ya and sacrificed two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations with (the\ntwo parts of the Mantra), 'Here is joy' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. VIII, 51 a), he\nsacrifices other oblations with (the verses):\n\n(a) 'Vastoshpati! Receive us (into thy protection); give us good entering and\ndrive away from us evil. For what we ask thee, with that favour us: be a\nsaviour to us, to men and animals. Svaha!\n\n(b) 'Vastoshpati! Be our furtherer; make our wealth increase in cows and\nhorses, O Indu (i.e. Soma). Free from decay may we dwell in thy friendship;\ngive us thy favour, as a father to his sons. Svaha!\n\n(c) 'Vastoshpati! Let us be in a fellowship with thee, which may be valiant,\njoyful, and well proceeding. Protect our wishes when we rest and\n\np. 347\n\nwhen we do our work. Protect us always, ye (gods), and give us welfare. Svaha!\n\n(d) 'Driving away calamity, Vastoshpati, assuming all shapes, be a kind friend\nto us. Svaha!\n\n8\\. He makes offerings of the mess of cooked food (with the following\nMantras):\n\n(a a) Agni, Indra, B _ri_ haspati, the Vi _s_ ve devas I invoke, Sarasvati and\nVa _g_ i. Give me a dwelling-place, ye vigorous ones. Svaha!\n\n(b b) 'To all the divine hosts of serpents, to the Himavat, the Sudar _s_ ana\n(mountain), and the Vasus, Rudras, \xc3\x82dityas, \xc3\x8e _s_ ana with his companions, to\nall these I apply. Give me a dwelling-place, ye vigorous ones. Svaha!\n\n(c) 'To forenoon and afternoon both together with noon, to evening and\nmidnight, to the goddess of dawn with her wide path, to all these I apply.\nGive me a dwelling-place, ye vigorous ones. Svaha!\n\n(d) 'To the Creator and the Changer, to Vi _s_ vakarman, to the herbs and\ntrees, to all these I apply. Give me a dwelling-place, ye vigorous ones.\nSvaha!\n\n(e) 'To Dhat _ri_ and Vidhat _ri_ , and to the Lord of treasures together with\nthem, to all these I apply. Give me a dwelling-place, ye vigorous ones. Svaha!\n\n(f) 'As a lucky, a happy (place), give me this dwelling-place, Brahman and Pra\n_g_ apati, and all deities. Svaha!'\n\n9\\. After he has partaken (of the sacrificial food), let him put into a brass\nvessel the different things which he has brought together, Udumbara leaves\nwith strong liquor, green turf, cowdung, curds,\n\np. 348\n\nhoney, ghee, Ku _s_ a grass, and barley, and let him besprinkle the seats and\nshrines (for the images of the gods).\n\n10\\. He touches (the wall and the posts) at their eastern juncture with (the\nwords), 'May luck and glory protect thee at thy eastern juncture.'\n\n11\\. He touches (them) at their southern juncture with (the words), 'May\nsacrifice and sacrificial fee protect thee at thy southern juncture.'\n\n12\\. He touches (them) at their western juncture with (the words), 'May food\nand the Brahma _n_ a protect thee at thy western juncture.'\n\n13\\. He touches (them) at their northern juncture with (the words), 'May\nvigour and delight protect thee at thy northern juncture.'\n\n14\\. He then goes out (of the house) and worships the quarters (of the\nhorizon, the east) with (the formulas), 'May Keta (i.e. will?) and Suketa\n(i.e. good-will?) protect me from the east.\n\n'Agni is Keta; the Sun is Suketa: to them I apply; to them be adoration; may\nthey protect me from the east.'\n\n15\\. Then to the south: 'May that which protects and that which guards,\nprotect me from the south.\n\n'The Day is that which protects; the Night is that which guards; to them I\napply; to them be adoration; may they protect me from the south.'\n\n16\\. Then to the west: 'May the shining one and the waking one protect me from\nthe west.\n\n'Food is the shining one; Breath is the waking one; to them I apply; to them\nbe adoration; may they protect me from the west.'\n\n17\\. Then to the north: 'May the sleepless one and the not-slumbering one\nprotect me from the north.\n\np. 349\n\n'The Moon is the sleepless one; the Wind is the not-slumbering one; to them I\napply; to them be adoration; may they protect me from the north.'\n\n18 18. When (the house) is finished, he enters it with (the formulas),\n\n'Law, the chief post! Fortune, the pinnacle! Day and night, the two door-\nboards!\n\n'Indra's house is wealthy, protecting; that I enter with my children, with my\ncattle, with everything that is mine.\n\n'Hither is called the whole number (of relatives), the friends whose coming is\ngood. Thus (I enter) thee, O house. May our dwellings be full of inviolable\nheroes from all sides!'\n\n19\\.

Sadhusa _m_ v _ri_ ta _h_ (if the reading is correct) seems to me to be\nthe nom. plur. of sadhusa _m_ v _ri_ t. I understand this to be a Bahuvrihi\ncompound, in which sa _m_ v _ri_ t means 'the approaching.' In Atharva-veda\nVII, 60, 4 we have sakhaya _h_ svadusa _m_ muda _h_. After _s_ ale a verb\nmeaning 'I enter,' or something like that, has been lost.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 5](sbe29195.htm)\n\n"
