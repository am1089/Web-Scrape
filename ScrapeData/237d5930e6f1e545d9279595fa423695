O Blessed Lord, O Supreme Ruler, how may one, who is held back by his\nPrarabdha Karma, obtain unswerving devotion? 1\n\np. 407\n\nThe Lord Vishnu said:\n\n2\\. If one be devoted to the constant practice of the Gita, even though he be\nrestrained by Prarabdha Karma, yet is he Mukta, happy, in this very world. lie\nis not tainted by (new) Karma.\n\n3\\. No evil, however great, can affect him who meditates on the Gita. He is\nlike the lotus leaf untouched by the water.\n\np. 408\n\n4-5. Where there is the book of the Gita, where its study is proceeded with,\nthere are present all the holy places, there verily, are Prayaga and the rest.\nThere also are all the Devas, Rishis, Yogins, and Pannagas, so also the\nGopalas and Gopikas, with Narada, Uddhava and their whole train of comrades.\n\n6\\. Where the Gita is read, forthwith comes help. Where the Gita is discussed,\nrecited, taught, or heard, there, O Earth, beyond a doubt, do I Myself\nunfailingly reside.\n\n7\\. In the refuge of the Gita I abide; the Gita is My chief abode. Standing on\nthe wisdom of the Gita, I maintain the three worlds.\n\np. 409\n\n8-9. The Gita is My Supreme Knowledge; it is undoubtedly inseparable from\nBrahman, this Knowledge is absolute, imperishable, eternal, of the essence of\nMy inexpressible State, the Knowledge comprising the whole of the three Vedas,\nsupremely blissful and consisting of the realisation of the true nature of the\nSelf,--declared by the All-knowing and Blessed Krishna, through his own lips,\nto Arjuna. 8\n\n10\\. That man who with steady mind recites the eighteen chapters daily,\nattains the perfection of knowledge and thus reaches the highest plane.\n\n11\\. If the whole cannot be recited, then half of it may be read; and he who\n\np. 410\n\ndoes this acquires merit, equal to that of the gift of a cow. There is no\ndoubt about. this.\n\n12\\. By the recitation of a third part,. he gains the same merit as by bathing\nin the Ganges. By the repetition of a. sixth part, he obtains the fruit of the\nSoma-sacrifice.\n\n13\\. He who reads, full of devotion, even one chapter daily, attains to the\nRudraloka, and lives there for a long time, having become one of those who\nwait on Shiva. 13\n\n14\\. The man who daily reads a quarter of a chapter, or of a Sloka, O Earth,\nattains to human birth throughout the duration of a Manu. 11\n\np. 411\n\n15-16. The man who recites ten, seven, five, four, three or two Slokas, or\neven one or half a Sloka of the Gita, certainly lives in Chandraloka for ten\nthousand years. He who leaves the body while reading the Gita, obtains the\nworld of Man.\n\n17\\. Again practising the Gita, he attains Supreme Mukti. The dying man\nuttering the word "Gita" will attain the goal.\n\n18\\. One who loves to hear the meaning of the Gita, even though he has\ncommitted heinous sins, attains to heaven, and lives in beatitude with Vishnu.\n\np. 412\n\n19\\. He who constantly meditates on the meaning of the Gita, even though he\nperforms Karma incessantly, he is to be regarded as a Jivanmukta, and after\nthe destruction of his body he attains to the highest plane of knowledge.\n\n20\\. By the help of this Gita, many kings like Janaka became free from their\nimpurities and attained to the highest goal. It is so sung.\n\n21\\. He who having finished the reading of the Gita, does not read its\nMahatmyam as declared here, his reading is in vain, it is all labour wasted.\n\n22\\. He who studies the Gita, accompanied with this discourse on its\nMahatmyam,\n\np. 413\n\nobtains the fruit stated herein, and reaches that goal which is difficult to\nattain.\n\nSuta said:\n\n23\\. He who will read this eternal greatness of the Gita, declared by me,\nafter having finished the reading of the Gita itself, will obtain the fruit\ndescribed herein. 23\n\np. 414\n\nThus ends in the Varaha Purana the discourse designated: The Greatness of the\nGita.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[406:*](sbg24.htm#fr_399) Ganesha is the god of wisdom and remover of\nobstacles; hence he is invoked and worshipped at the commencement of every\nimportant undertaking. Radharamana--the Lover of Radha,--Sri Krishna.\n\n[406:1](sbg24.htm#fr_400) _Pr arabdha Karma_--There are three kinds of Karma:\n(1) Sanchita or accumulated and stored up in past lives; (2) Agami or that\nwhich is yet to be done; (3) Prarabdha or that which is already bearing fruit.\nThis last is that part of the accumulated actions (Sanchita) which has brought\nabout the p. 407 present life and will influence it until its close. The\nknowledge of Brahman destroys all accumulated Karma and makes the current work\nabortive. But the Prarabdha Karma must run out its course, though the balanced\nmind of a liberated man is not affected by it.\n\n[409:8](sbg24.htm#fr_401) _Ardham atra_--lit. the half-syllable, and refers to\nthe dot on the  ![](img/40900.jpg); symbolically, it stands for the Turiya\nstate, hence the Absolute.\n\n[410:13](sbg24.htm#fr_402) _Become &c._--lit., attained to Ganahood.\n\n[410:11](sbg24.htm#fr_403) _Attains to Manhood:_ is born every time in a man-\nbody.\n\n[413:23](sbg24.htm#fr_404) These declarations will, no doubt, seem to be mere\nflights of extravagant fancy, if they are taken in their literal sense. They\nmay be explained either (1) as mere Arthavada or a statement of glorification\nmeant to stimulate a strong desire for the study of the Gita, which being\nperformed from day to day, may, by the force of the truth and grandeur of one\nor other of its teachings, strike an inner chord of the heart some time, so\nmuch so as to change the whole nature of the man for good; (2) or, the\n"reading" and "reciting" and so forth, of the whole or a part, may not perhaps\nbe taken in their ordinary sense, as meaning lip-utterance and the like, but\nin view of the great results indicated, they may be reasonably construed to\nmean the assimilation of p. 414 the essence of the Gita teachings into the\npractical daily life of the individual. What wonder, then, that such a one who\nis the embodiment of the Gita would be a true Jnanin, or a Jivanmukta, or that\nhe would, in proportion to his success of being so, attain the intermediate\nspheres of evolution and finally obtain Mukti?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Index](sbg25.htm)\n\n'
