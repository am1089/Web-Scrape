And, moreover, it (i.e. Scripture) teaches the joining of this (i.e. the\nindividual soul) with that, (i.e. the Self consisting of bliss), on that\n(being fully known).\n\nAnd for the following reason also the term, 'the Self consisting of bliss,'\ncannot denote either the pradhana or the individual soul. Scripture teaches\nthat the individual soul when it has reached knowledge is joined, i.e.\nidentified, with the Self of bliss under discussion, i.e. obtains final\nrelease. Compare the following passage (Taitt. Up. II, 7), 'When he finds\nfreedom from fear, and rest in that which is invisible, incorporeal,\nundefined, unsupported, then he has obtained the fearless. For if he makes but\nthe smallest distinction in it there is fear for him.' That means, if he sees\nin that Self consisting of bliss even a small difference in the form of non-\nidentity, then he finds no release from the fear of transmigratory existence.\nBut when he, by means of the cognition of absolute identity, finds absolute\nrest in the Self consisting of bliss, then he is freed from the fear of\ntransmigratory existence. But this (finding absolute rest) is possible only\nwhen we understand by the Self consisting of bliss, the highest Self, and not\neither the pradhana or the individual soul. Hence it is proved that the Self\nconsisting of bliss is the highest Self.\n\nBut, in reality, the following remarks have to be made concerning the true\nmeaning of the word 'anandamaya 1.' On what grounds, we ask, can it be\nmaintained that the\n\np. 72\n\naffix 'maya' after having, in the series of compounds beginning with annamaya\nand ending with vi _g \xc3\xb1_anamaya, denoted mere modifications, should all at\nonce, in the word anandamaya, which belongs to the same series, denote\nabundance, so that anandamaya would refer to Brahman? If it should be said\nthat the assumption is made on account of the governing influence of the\nBrahman proclaimed in the mantra (which forms the beginning of the chapter,\nTaitt. Up. II), we reply that therefrom it would follow that also the Selfs\nconsisting of food, breath, &c., denote Brahman (because the governing\ninfluence of the mantra extends to them also).--The advocate of the former\ninterpretation will here, perhaps, restate an argument already made use of\nabove, viz. as follows: To assume that the Selfs consisting of food, and so\non, are not Brahman is quite proper, because after each of them an inner Self\nis mentioned. After the Self of bliss, on the other hand, no further inner\nSelf is mentioned, and hence it must be considered to be Brahman itself;\notherwise we should commit the mistake of dropping the subject-matter in hand\n(as which Brahman is pointed out by the mantra), and taking up a new topic.--\nBut to this we reply that, although unlike the case of the Selfs consisting of\nfood, &c., no inner Self is mentioned after the Self consisting of bliss,\nstill the latter cannot be considered as Brahman, because with reference to\nthe Self consisting of bliss Scripture declares, 'Joy is its head.\nSatisfaction is its right arm. Great satisfaction is its left arm. Bliss is\nits trunk. Brahman is its tail, its support.' Now, here the very same Brahman\nwhich, in the mantra, had been introduced as the subject of the discussion, is\ncalled the tail, the support; while the five involucra, extending from the\ninvolucrum of food up to the involucrum of bliss, are merely introduced for\nthe purpose of setting forth the knowledge of Brahman. How, then, can it be\nmaintained that our interpretation implies the needless dropping of the\ngeneral subject-matter and the introduction of a new topic?--But, it may again\nbe objected, Brahman is called the tail, i.e. a member of the Self consisting\nof bliss; analogously to those passages in which a tail and\n\np. 73\n\nother members are ascribed to the Selfs consisting of food and so on. On what\ngrounds, then, can we claim to know that Brahman (which is spoken of as a mere\nmember, i.e. a subordinate matter) is in reality the chief matter referred to?\n--From the fact, we reply, of Brahman being the general subject-matter of the\nchapter.--But, it will again be said, that interpretation also according to\nwhich Brahman is cognised as a mere member of the anandamaya does not involve\na dropping of the subject-matter, since the anandamaya himself is Brahman.--\nBut, we reply, in that case one and the same Brahman would at first appear as\nthe whole, viz. as the Self consisting of bliss, and thereupon as a mere part,\nviz. as the tail; which is absurd. And as one of the two alternatives must be\npreferred, it is certainly appropriate to refer to Brahman the clause 'Brahman\nis the tail' which contains the word 'Brahman,' and not the sentence about the\nSelf of Bliss in which Brahman is not mentioned. Moreover, Scripture, in\ncontinuation of the phrase, 'Brahman is the tail, the support,' goes on, 'On\nthis there is also the following _s_ loka: He who knows the Brahman as non-\nexisting becomes himself non-existing. He who knows Brahman as existing him we\nknow himself as existing.' As this _s_ loka, without any reference to the Self\nof bliss, states the advantage and disadvantage connected with the knowledge\nof the being and non-being of Brahman only, we conclude that the clause,\n'Brahman is the tail, the support,' represents Brahman as the chief matter\n(not as a merely subordinate matter). About the being or non-being of the Self\nof bliss, on the other hand, a doubt is not well possible, since the Self of\nbliss distinguished by joy, satisfaction, &c., is well known to every one.--\nBut if Brahman is the principal matter, how can it be designated as the mere\ntail of the Self of bliss ('Brahman is the tail, the support')?--Its being\ncalled so, we reply, forms no objection; for the word tail here denotes that\nwhich is of the nature of a tail, so that we have to understand that the bliss\nof Brahman is not a member (in its literal sense), but the support or abode,\nthe one nest (resting-place) of all worldly bliss. Analogously another\n\np. 74\n\nscriptural passage declares, 'All other creatures live on a small portion of\nthat bliss' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 32). Further, if by the Self consisting of\nbliss we were to understand Brahman we should have to assume that the Brahman\nmeant is the Brahman distinguished by qualities (savi _s_ esha), because it is\nsaid to have joy and the like for its members. But this assumption is\ncontradicted by a complementary passage (II, 9) which declares that Brahman is\nthe object neither of mind nor speech, and so shows that the Brahman meant is\nthe (absolute) Brahman (devoid of qualities), 'From whence all speech, with\nthe mind, turns away unable to reach it, he who knows the bliss of that\nBrahman fears nothing.' Moreover, if we speak of something as 'abounding in\nbliss 1,' we thereby imply the co-existence of pain; for the word 'abundance'\nin its ordinary sense implies the existence of a small measure of what is\nopposed to the thing whereof there is abundance. But the passage so understood\nwould be in conflict with another passage ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 24), 'Where one\nsees nothing else, hears nothing else, understands nothing else, that is the\nInfinite;' which declares that in the Infinite, i.e. Brahman, there is nothing\nwhatever different from it. Moreover, as joy, &c. differ in each individual\nbody, the Self consisting of bliss also is a different one in each body.\nBrahman, on the other hand, does not differ according to bodies; for the\nmantra at the beginning of the chapter declares it to be true Being,\nknowledge, infinite, and another passage says, 'He is the one God, hidden in\nall beings, all-pervading, the Self within all beings' ( _S_ v. Up. VI, 11).\nNor, again, does Scripture exhibit a frequent repetition of the word\n'anandamaya;' for merely the radical part of the compound (i.e. the word\nananda without the affix maya) is repeated in all the following passages; 'It\nis a flavour, for only after seizing flavour can any one seize bliss. Who\ncould breathe, who could breathe forth, if that bliss existed not in the\nether? For he alone causes blessedness;' 'Now this is an examination of\nbliss;' 'He who\n\np. 75\n\nknows the bliss of that Brahman fears nothing;' 'He understood that bliss is\nBrahman.' If it were a settled matter that Brahman is denoted by the term,\n'the Self consisting of bliss,' then we could assume that in the subsequent\npassages, where merely the word 'bliss' is employed, the term 'consisting of\nbliss' is meant to be repeated; but that the Self consisting of bliss is not\nBrahman, we have already proved by means of the reason of joy being its head,\nand so on. Hence, as in another scriptural passage, viz. 'Brahman is knowledge\nand bliss' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 28), the mere word 'bliss' denotes Brahman, we\nmust conclude that also in such passages as, 'If that bliss existed not in the\nether,' the word bliss is used with reference to Brahman, and is not meant to\nrepeat the term 'consisting of bliss.' The repetition of the full compound,\n'consisting of bliss,' which occurs in the passage, 'He reaches that Self\nconsisting of bliss' (Taitt. Up. II, 8), does not refer to Brahman, as it is\ncontained in the enumeration of Non-Selfs, comprising the Self of food, &c.,\nall of which are mere effects, and all of which are represented as things to\nbe reached.--But, it may be said, if the Self consisting of bliss, which is\nsaid to have to be reached, were not Brahman--just as the Selfs consisting of\nfood, &c. are not Brahman--then it would not be declared (in the passage\nimmediately following) that he who knows obtains for his reward Brahman.--This\nobjection we invalidate by the remark that the text makes its declaration as\nto Brahman--which is the tail, the support--being reached by him who knows, by\nthe very means of the declaration as to the attainment of the Self of bliss;\nas appears from the passage, 'On this there is also this _s_ loka, from which\nall speech returns,' &c. With reference, again, to the passage, 'He desired:\nmay I be many, may I grow forth,' which is found in proximity to the mention\nof the Self consisting of bliss, we remark that it is in reality connected\n(not with the Self of bliss but with) Brahman, which is mentioned in the still\nnearer passage, 'Brahman is the tail, the support,' and does therefore not\nintimate that the Self of bliss is Brahman. And, on account of its referring\nto the passage last quoted ('it desired,' &c.), the later passage\n\np. 76\n\nalso, 'That is flavour,' &c., has not the Self of bliss for its subject.--But,\nit may be objected, the (neuter word) Brahman cannot possibly be designated by\na masculine word as you maintain is done in the passage, 'He desired,' &c.--In\nreply to this objection we point to the passage (Taitt. Up. II, 1), 'From that\nSelf sprang ether,' where, likewise, the masculine word 'Self' can refer to\nBrahman only, since the latter is the general topic of the chapter. In the\nknowledge of Bh _ri_ gu and Varu _n_ a finally ('he knew that bliss is\nBrahman'), the word 'bliss' is rightly understood to denote Brahman, since we\nthere meet neither with the affix 'maya,' nor with any statement as to joy\nbeing its head, and the like. To ascribe to Brahman in itself joy, and so on,\nas its members, is impossible, unless we have recourse to certain, however\nminute, distinctions qualifying Brahman; and that the whole chapter is not\nmeant to convey a knowledge of the qualified (savi _s_ esha) Brahman is proved\nby the passage (quoted above), which declares that Brahman transcends speech\nand mind. We therefore must conclude that the affix maya, in the word\nanandamaya, does not denote abundance, but expresses a mere effect, just as it\ndoes in the words annamaya and the subsequent similar compounds.\n\nThe Sutras are therefore to be explained as follows. There arises the question\nwhether the passage, 'Brahman is the tail, the support,' is to be understood\nas intimating that Brahman is a mere member of the Self consisting of bliss,\nor that it is the principal matter. If it is said that it must be considered\nas a mere member, the reply is, 'The Self consisting of bliss on account of\nthe repetition.' That means: Brahman, which in the passage 'the Self\nconsisting of bliss,' &c., is spoken of as the tail, the support, is\ndesignated as the principal matter (not as something subordinate). On account\nof the repetition; for in the memorial _s_ loka, 'he becomes himself non-\nexisting,' Brahman alone is reiterated. 'If not, on account of the word\ndenoting a modification; not so, on account of abundance.' In this Sutra the\nword 'modification' is meant to convey the sense of member. The objection that\non account of\n\np. 77\n\nthe word 'tail,' which denotes a mere member, Brahman cannot be taken as the\nprincipal matter must be refuted. This we do by remarking that there is no\ndifficulty, since a word denoting a member may be introduced into the passage\non account of pra _k_ urya 1. Pra _k_ urya here means a phraseology abounding\nin terms denoting members. After the different members, beginning with the\nhead and ending with the tail, of the Selfs, consisting of food, &c. have been\nenumerated, there are also mentioned the head and the other limbs of the Self\nof bliss, and then it is added, 'Brahman is the tail, the support;' the\nintention being merely to introduce some more terms denoting members, not to\nconvey the meaning of 'member,' (an explanation which is impossible) because\nthe preceding Sutra already has proved Brahman (not to be a member, but) to be\nthe principal matter. 'And because he is declared to be the cause of it.' That\nmeans: Brahman is declared to be the cause of the entire aggregate of effects,\ninclusive of the Self, consisting of bliss, in the following passage, 'He\ncreated all whatever there is' (Taitt. Up. II, 6). And as Brahman is the\ncause, it cannot at the same time be called the member, in the literal sense\nof the word, of the Self of bliss, which is nothing but one of Brahman's\neffects. The other Sutras also (which refer to the Self of bliss 2) are to be\nconsidered, as well as they may, as conveying a knowledge of Brahman, which\n(Brahman) is referred to in the passage about the tail.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[71:1](sbe34025.htm#fr_115) The explanation of the anandamaya given hitherto\nis here recalled, and a different one given.
