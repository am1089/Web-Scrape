But the designation (as being born and dying) abides in the (bodies of\nbeings) moving and non-moving; it is secondary (metaphorical) if applied to\nthe soul, as the existence (of those terms) depends on the existence of that\n(i.e. the body).\n\nOn account of certain popular modes of expression such as 'Devadatta is born,'\n'Devadatta has died,' and the like, and on account of certain ceremonies such\nas the _G_ atakakarman some people might fall into the error of thinking that\nthe individual soul has a beginning, and in the end undergoes destruction.\nThis error we are going to dispel.--The individual soul has no beginning and\nis not subject to dissolution, since thus only it can be connected with the\nresults of actions, as the _S_ astra teaches. If the individual soul perished\nafter the body, there would be no sense in the religious injunctions and\nprohibitions referring to the enjoyment and avoidance of pleasant and\nunpleasant things in another body (another birth). And scripture says, 'This\nbody indeed dies when the living soul has left it, the living soul does not\ndie' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, ii, 3).--But it has been pointed out above that ordinary\nlanguage speaks of the birth and the death of the individual soul!--True; but\nthe terms 'birth' and 'death,' if applied to the soul, have to\n\np. 29\n\nbe taken in a secondary sense.--What then is that thing to which those words\napply in their primary sense, and with reference to which we can speak of a\nsecondary sense?--They apply, we answer, to whatever moves and whatever does\nnot move. The words 'birth' and 'death' have reference to the bodies of moving\nand non-moving beings; for such beings are born (produced) and die. To them\nthe terms 'birth' and 'death' apply in their primary sense; while they are\nused metaphorically only with reference to the soul dwelling in them. For\ntheir existence (i.e. their being used) depends on the existence of the body;\ni.e. the words 'birth' and 'death' are used where there take place the\nmanifestation and disappearance of bodies, not where they are absent. For\nnobody ever observes a soul being born or dying, apart from its connexion with\na body. That the words 'birth' and 'death' have reference to the conjunction\nwith--and separation from--a body merely, is also shown by the following\npassage: 'On being born that person assuming his body, &c.; when he passes out\n(of the body) and dies,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 8). The _g_ ata-ceremony also\nis to be viewed as having reference to the manifestation of the body only; for\nthe soul is not manifested.--Whether the individual soul is produced from the\nhighest Self like ether, &c. or not, will be discussed in the next Sutra; the\npresent Sutra merely states that the gross origination and dissolution which\nbelong to the body do not affect the soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 17](sbe38018.htm)\n\n"
