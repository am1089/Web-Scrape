He (the Self) bears the Self in two ways 2, as he who is Pra _n_ a\n(breath), and as he who is \xc3\x82ditya (the sun). Therefore there are two paths for\nhim 3, within and without, and they both turn back in a day and night. The Sun\nis the outer Self, the inner Self is Breath. Hence the motion of the inner\nSelf is inferred from the motion of the outer Self 4 For thus it is said:\n\n\'He who knows, and has thrown off all evil, the overseer of the senses 5, the\npure-minded, firmly\n\np. 306\n\ngrounded (in the Self) and looking away (from all earthly objects), he is the\nsame.\' Likewise the motion of the outer Self is inferred from the motion of\nthe inner Self. For thus it is said:\n\n\'He who within the sun is the golden person, who looks upon this earth from\nhis golden place, he is the same who, after entering the inner lotus of the\nheart 1, devours food (perceives sensuous objects, &c.)\'\n\n2\\. And he who having entered the inner lotus of the heart, devours food, the\nsame, having gone te, the sky as the fire of the sun, called Time, and being\ninvisible, devours all beings as his food.\n\nWhat is that lotus and of what is it made? (the Valakhilyas ask 2.)\n\nThat lotus is the same as the ether; the four quarters, and the four\nintermediate points are its leaves 3.\n\nThese two, Breath and the Sun, move on near to each other (in the heart and in\nthe ether). Let him worship these two, with the syllable Om, with the Vyah\n_ri_ ti words (bhu _h_ , bhuva _h_ , svar), and with the Savitri hymn.\n\n3\\. There are two forms of Brahman 4, the material (effect) and the immaterial\n(cause). The material is false, the immaterial is true. That which is true is\nBrahman, that which is Brahman is light, and that which is light is the Sun 5.\nAnd this Sun became the Self of that Om.\n\np. 307\n\nHe divided himself threefold, for Om consists of three letters, a + u + m.\nThrough them all this 1 is contained in him as warp and woof. For thus it is\nsaid:\n\n\'Meditate on that Sun as Om, join your Self (the breath) with the (Self of\nthe) Sun.\'\n\n4\\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: The Udgitha (of the Sama-veda) is the\nPra _n_ ava 2 (of the _Ri_ g-veda), and the Pra _n_ ava is the Udgitha, and\nthus the Sun is Udgitha, and he is Pra _n_ ava or Om. For thus it is said 3:\n\n\'The Udgitha, called Pra _n_ ava, the leader (in the performance of\nsacrifices), the bright 4, the sleepless, free from old age and death, three-\nfooted 5, consisting of three letters (a + u + m), and likewise to be known as\nfivefold (five pra _n_ as) placed in the cave.\' And it is also said:\n\n\'The three-footed Brahman has its root upward 6, the branches are ether, wind,\nfire, water, earth, &c. This one Asvattha 7 by name, the world, is Brahman,\nand of it that is the light which is called the Sun, and it is also the light\nof that syllable Om. Therefore let him for ever worship that (breath and sun,\nas manifestations of Brahman) with the syllable Om.\'\n\nHe alone enlightens us. For thus it is said:\n\np. 308\n\n\'This alone is the pure syllable, this alone is the highest syllable; he who\nknows that syllable only, whatever he desires, is his 1.\'\n\n5\\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: This Om 2 is the sound-endowed body\nof him (Pra _n_ adityatman). This is his gender-endowed body, viz. feminine,\nmasculine, neuter. This is his light-endowed body, viz. Agni, Vayu, \xc3\x82ditya.\nThis is his lord-endowed body, viz. Brahma, Rudra, Vish _n_ u. This is his\nmouth-endowed body, viz. Garhapatya, Dakshi _n_ agni, \xc3\x82havaniya 3. This is his\nknowledge-endowed body, viz. _Ri_ _k_ , Ya _g_ us, Saman. This is his world-\nendowed body, viz. Bhu _h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Svar. This is his time-endowed body,\nviz. Past, Present, Future. This is his heat-endowed body, viz. Breath, Fire,\nSun. This is his growth-endowed body, viz. Food, Water, Moon. This is his\nthought-endowed body, viz. intellect, mind, personality. This is his breath-\nendowed body, viz. Pra _n_ a, Apana, Vyana. Therefore by the aforesaid\nsyllable Om are all these here enumerated bodies praised and identified (with\nthe Pra _n_ adityatman). For thus it is said 4:\n\n\'O Satyakama, the syllable Om is the high and the low Brahman.\'\n\n6\\. This 5 (world) was unuttered 6. Then forsooth Pra _g_ apati, having\nbrooded, uttered it in the words Bhu _h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Svar. This is the\ngrossest body of that Pra _g_ apati, consisting of the three worlds 7. Of that\nbody Svar is the head, Bhuva _h_ the navel, Bhu _h_\n\np. 309\n\nthe feet, the sun the eye. For in the eye is fixed man\'s great measure,\nbecause with the eye he makes all measurements. The eye is truth (satyam), for\nthe person (purusha) dwelling in the eye proceeds to all things (knows all\nobjects with certainty). Therefore let a man worship with the Vyah _ri_ tis,\nBhu _h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Svar, for thus Pra _g_ apati, the Self of All, is\nworshipped as the (sun, the) Eye of All 1. For thus it is said:\n\n\'This (the sun) is Pra _g_ apati\'s all-supporting body, for in it this all 2\nis hid (by the light of the sun); and in this all it (the light) is hid.\nTherefore this is worshipped 3.\'\n\n7\\. (The Savitri begins 4:) Tat Savitur vare _n_ yam, i.e. \'this of Savit _ri_\n, to be chosen.\' Here the \xc3\x82ditya (sun) is Savit _ri_ , and the same is to be\nchosen by the love(r) of Self, thus say the Brahma-teachers.\n\n(Then follows the next foot in the Savit _ri_ ): Bhargo devasya dhimahi, i.e.\n\'the splendour of the god we meditate on.\' Here the god is Savit _ri_ , and\ntherefore he who is called his splendour, him I meditate on, thus say the\nBrahma-teachers.\n\np. 310\n\n(Then follows the last foot): Dhiyo yo na _h_ pra _k_ odayat, i.e. \'who should\nstir up our thoughts.\' Here the dhiya _h_ are thoughts, and he should stir\nthese up for us, thus say the Brahma-teachers.\n\n(He now explains the word bhargas). Now he who is called bhargas is he who is\nplaced in yonder \xc3\x82ditya (sun), or he who is the pupil in the eye 1. And he is\nso called, because his going (gati) is by rays (bhabhi _h_ ); or because he\nparches (bhar _g_ ayati) and makes the world to shrivel up. Rudra is called\nBhargas, thus say the Brahma-teachers. Or bha means that he lights up these\nworlds; ra, that he delights these beings, ga that these creatures go to him\nand come from him; therefore being a bha-ra-ga, he is called Bhargas.\n\nSurya 2 (sun) is so called, because Soma is continually squeezed out (su).\nSavit _ri_ (sun) is so called, because he brings forth (su). \xc3\x82ditya (sun) is\nso called, because he takes up (ada, scil. vapour, or the life of man). Pavana\n3 is so called, because he purifies (pu). Apas, water, is so called, because\nit nourishes (pya).\n\nAnd it is said:\n\n\'Surely the Self (absorbed in Pra _n_ a, breath), which is called Immortal 4,\nis the thinker, the perceiver, the goer, the evacuator 5, the delighter, the\ndoer, the speaker, the taster, the smeller, the seer, the hearer, and he\ntouches. He is Vibhu (the pervader), who has entered into the body.\' And it is\nsaid:\n\np. 311\n\n\'When the knowledge is twofold (subjective and objective), then he hears,\nsees, smells, tastes, and touches (something), for it is the Self that knows\neverything.\'\n\nBut when the knowledge is not twofold (subjective only), without effect,\ncause, and action 1, without a name, without a comparison, without a predicate\n2\\--what is that? It cannot be told 3.\n\n8\\. And the same Self is also called I _s_ ana (lord), _S_ ambhu, Bhava, Rudra\n(tamasa); Pra _g_ apati (lord of creatures), Vi _s_ vas _ri_ _g_ (creator of\nall), Hira _n_ yagarbha, Satyam (truth), Pra _n_ a, (breath), Ha _m_ sa (ra\n_g_ asa); _S_ ast _ri_ (ruler), Vish _n_ u, Naraya _n_ a (sattvika); Arka,\nSavit _ri_ , Dhat _ri_ (supporter), Vidhat _ri_  4 (creator), Samra _g_\n(king), Indra, Indu (moon). He is also he who warms, the Sun, hidden by the\nthousand-eyed golden egg, as one fire by another. He is to be thought after,\nhe is to be sought after. Having said farewell to all living beings, having\ngone to the forest, and having renounced all sensuous objects, let man\nperceive the Self 5 from his own body.\n\n\'(See him) 6 who assumes all forms, the golden, who knows all things, who\nascends highest, alone in his splendour, and warms us; the thousand-rayed,\n\np. 312\n\nwho abides in a hundred places, the spirit of all creatures, the Sun, rises\n1.\'\n\n9\\. Therefore he who by knowing this has become the Self of both Breath and\nSun, meditates (while meditating on them) on his Self, sacrifices (while\nsacrificing to them) to his Self-this meditation, the mind thus absorbed in\nthese acts, is praised by the wise.\n\nThen let him purify the contamination of the mind by the verse U _k_ _kh_ ish\n_t_ opahatam, &c. 2: \'Be it food left, or food defiled by left food, be it\nfood given by a sinner, food coming from a dead person, or from one impure\nfrom childbirth, may the purifying power of Vasu, may Agni, and the rays of\nSavit _ri_ , purify it, and all my sin 3.\'\n\nFirst (before eating) he surrounds (the offered food) with water (in rincing\nhis mouth 4) . Then saying, Svaha to Pra _n_ a, Svaha to Apana, Svaha to\nVyana, Svaha to Samana, Svaha to Udana, he offers (the food) with five\ninvocations (in the fire of the mouth). What is over, he eats in silence, and\nthen he surrounds (the food) once more afterwards with water (rincing the\nmouth after his meal). Having washed let him, after sacrificing to himself,\nmeditate on his Self with these two verses, Pra _n_ o \'gni _h_ and Vi _s_ vo\n\'si, viz. \'May the Highest Self as breath, as fire (digestive heat), as\nconsisting of the\n\np. 313\n\nfive vital airs, having entered (the body), himself satisfied, satisfy all, he\nwho protects all.\' \'Thou art Vi _s_ va (all), thou art Vai _s_ vanara (fire),\nall that is born is upheld by thee; may all offerings enter into thee;\ncreatures live where thou grantest immortality to all.\' He who eats according\nto this rule, does not in turn become food for others.\n\n10\\. There is something else to be known. There is a further modification of\nthis Self-sacrifice (the eating), namely, the food and the eater thereof. This\nis the explanation. The thinking Purusha (person), when he abides within the\nPradhana (nature), is the feeder who feeds on the food supplied by Prak _ri_\nti (nature). The elemental Self 1 is truly his food, his maker being Pradhana\n(nature 2). Therefore what is composed of the three qualities (gu _n_ as) is\nthe food, but the person within is the feeder. And for this the evidence is\nsupplied by the senses. For animals spring from seed, and as the seed is the\nfood, therefore it is clear that what is food is Pradhana (the seed or cause\nof everything). Therefore, as has been said, the Purusha (person) is the\neater, Prak _ri_ ti, the food; and abiding within it he feeds. All that begins\nwith the Mahat 3 (power of intellect) and ends with the Vi _s_ eshas (elements\n4), being developed from the distinction of nature with its three qualities,\nis the sign (that there must be a Purusha, an intelligent\n\np. 314\n\nsubject). And in this manner the way with its fourteen steps has been\nexplained 1. (This is comprehended in the following verse): \'This world is\nindeed the food, called pleasure, pain, and error (the result of the three\nqualities); there is no laying hold of the taste of the seed (cause), so long\nas there is no development (in the shape of effect).\' And in its three stages\nalso it has the character of food, as childhood, youth, and old age; for,\nbecause these are developed, therefore there is in them the character of food\n2.\n\nAnd in the following manner does the perception of Pradhana (nature) take\nplace, after it has become manifest:--Intellect and the rest, such as\ndetermination, conception, consciousness, are for the tasting (of the effects\nof Pradhana). Then there are the five (perceptive organs) intended for the\n(five) objects of senses, for to taste them. And thus are all acts of the five\nactive organs, and the acts of the five Pra _n_ as or vital airs (for the\ntasting of their corresponding objects). Thus what is manifest (of nature) is\nfood, and what is not manifest is food. The enjoyer of it is without\nqualities, but because he has the quality of being an enjoyer, it follows that\nhe possesses intelligence.\n\nAs Agni (fire) is the food-eater among the gods, and Soma the food, so he who\nknows this eats food by Agni (is not defiled by food, as little as Agni, the\nsacrificial fire). This elemental Self, called Soma (food), is also called\nAgni, as having undeveloped nature for its mouth (as enjoying through nature,\nand being independent of it), because it is said, \'The\n\np. 315\n\n[paragraph continues] Purusha (person) enjoys nature with its three qualities,\nby the mouth of undeveloped nature.\' He who knows this, is an ascetic, a\nyogin, he is a performer of the Self-sacrifice (see before). And he who does\nnot touch the objects of the senses when they intrude on him, as no one would\ntouch women intruding into an empty house, he is an ascetic, a yogin, a\nperformer of the Self-sacrifice.\n\n11\\. This is the highest form of Self, viz. food, for this Pra _n_ a (this\nbody) subsists on food. If it eats not, it cannot perceive, hear, touch, see,\nsmell, taste, and it loses the vital airs 1. For thus it is said:\n\n\'If it eats, then in full possession of the vital airs, it can perceive, hear,\ntouch, speak, taste, smell, see.\' And thus it is said:\n\n\'From food are born all creatures that live on earth; afterwards they live on\nfood, and in the end (when they die) they return to it 2.\'\n\n12\\. And thus it is said elsewhere: Surely all these creatures run about day\nand night, wishing to catch food. The sun takes food with his rays, and by it\nhe shines. These vital airs digest, when sprinkled with food. Fire flares up\nby food, and by Brahma (Pra _g_ apati), desirous of food, has all this been\nmade. Therefore let a man worship food as his Self. For thus it is said:\n\n\'From food creatures are born, by food they grow when born; because it is\neaten and because it cats creatures, therefore it is called food (annam).\'\n\n13\\. And thus it is said elsewhere: This food is the body of the blessed Vish\n_n_ u, called Vi _s_ vabh _ri_ t (all-sustaining). Breath is the essence of\nfood, mind of breath, knowledge of mind, joy of knowledge. He\n\np. 316\n\nwho knows this is possessed of food, breath, mind, knowledge, and joy.\nWhatever creatures here on earth eat food, abiding in them he, who knows this,\neats food. Food has been called undecaying, food has been called worshipful;\nfood is the breath of animals, food is the oldest, food has been called the\nphysician.\n\n14\\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: Food is the cause of all this, time\nof food, and the sun is the cause of time 1. The (visible) form of time is the\nyear, consisting of twelve months, made up of Nimeshas (twinklings) and other\nmeasures. Of the year one half (when the sun moves northward) belongs to Agni,\nthe other to Varu _n_ a (when the sun moves southward). That which belongs to\nAgni begins with the asterism of Magha, and ends with half of the asterism of\nSravish _th_ a, the sun stepping down northward. That which belongs to Soma\n(instead of Varu _n_ a) begins with the asterism (of A _s_ lesha), sacred to\nthe Serpents, and ends with half of the asterism of Sravish _th_ a, the sun\nstepping up southward. And then there (are the months) one by one, belonging\nto the year, each consisting of nine-fourths of asterisms (two asterisms and a\nquarter being the twelfth part of the passage of the sun through the twenty-\nseven Nakshatras), each determined by the sun moving together with the\nasterisms. Because time is imperceptible by sense, therefore this (the\nprogress of the sun, &c.) is its evidence, and by it alone is time proved to\nexist. Without proof there is no apprehension of what is to be proved; but\neven what is to be proved can become proof, for the sake of making itself\nknown,\n\np. 317\n\nif the parts (the twinklings, &c.) can be distinguished from the whole (time\n1). For thus it is said:\n\n\'As many portions of time as there are, through them the sun proceeds: he who\nworships time as Brahman, from him time moves away very far.\' And thus it is\nsaid:\n\n\'From time all beings flow, from time they grow; in time they obtain rest;\ntime is visible (sun) and invisible (moments).\'\n\n15\\. There are two forms of Brahman, time and non-time. That which was before\nthe (existence of the) sun is non-time and has no parts. That which had its\nbeginning from the sun is time and has parts. Of that which has parts, the\nyear is the form, and from the year are born all creatures; when produced by\nthe year they grow, and go again to rest in the year. Therefore the year is\nPra _g_ apati, is time, is food, is the nest of Brahman, is Self. Thus it is\nsaid:\n\n\'Time ripens and dissolves all beings in the great Self, but he who knows into\nwhat time itself is dissolved, he is the knower of the Veda.\'\n\n16\\. This manifest time is the great ocean of creatures. He who is called\nSavit _ri_ (the sun, as begetter) dwells in it, from whence the moon, stars,\nplanets, the year, and the rest are begotten. From them again comes all this,\nand thus, whatever of good or evil is seen in this world, comes from them.\nTherefore Brahman is the Self of the sun, and a man should worship the sun\nunder the name of time. Some say the sun is Brahman, and thus it is said:\n\np. 318\n\n\'The sacrificer, the deity that enjoys the sacrifice, the oblation, the hymn,\nthe sacrifice, Vish _n_ u, Pra _g_ apati, all this is the Lord, the witness,\nthat shines in yonder orb.\'\n\n17\\. In the beginning Brahman was all this 1. He was one, and infinite;\ninfinite in the East, infinite in the South, infinite in the West, infinite in\nthe North, above and below and everywhere infinite. East and the other regions\ndo not exist for him, nor across, nor below, nor above. The Highest Self is\nnot to be fixed, he is unlimited, unborn, not to be reasoned about, not to be\nconceived. He is like the ether (everywhere), and at the destruction of the\nuniverse, he alone is awake. Thus from that ether he wakes all this world,\nwhich consists of thought only, and by him alone is all this meditated on, and\nin him it is dissolved. His is that luminous form which shines in the sun, and\nthe manifold light in the smokeless fire, and the heat which in the stomach\ndigests the food. Thus it is said:\n\n\'He who is in the fire, and he who is in the heart, and he who is in the sun,\nthey are one and the same.\'\n\nHe who knows this becomes one with the one.\n\n18\\. This is the rule for achieving it (viz. concentration of the mind on the\nobject of meditation): restraint of the breath, restraint of the senses,\nmeditation, fixed attention, investigation, absorption, these are called the\nsixfold Yoga 2. When beholding by\n\np. 319\n\nthis Yoga, he beholds the gold-coloured maker, the lord, the person, Brahman,\nthe cause, then the sage, leaving behind good and evil, makes everything\n(breath, organs of sense, body, &c.) to be one in the Highest Indestructible\n(in the pratyagatman or Brahman). And thus it is said:\n\n\'As birds and deer do not approach a burning mountain, so sins never approach\nthose who know Brahman.\'\n\n19\\. And thus it is said elsewhere: When he who knows has, while he is still\nPra _n_ a (breath), restrained his mind, and placed all objects of the senses\nfar away from himself, then let him remain without any conceptions. And\nbecause the living person, called Pra _n_ a (breath), has been produced here\non earth from that which is not Pra _n_ a (the thinking Self), therefore let\nthis Pra _n_ a merge the Pra _n_ a (himself) in what is called the fourth 1.\nAnd thus it is said:\n\n\'What is without thought, though placed in the centre of thought, what cannot\nbe thought, the hidden, the highest--let a man merge his thought there: then\nwill this living being (li\xe1\xb9\x85ga) be without attachment 2.\'\n\n20\\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: There is the superior fixed\nattention (dhara _n_ a) for him, viz. if he presses the tip of the tongue down\nthe palate and restrains voice, mind, and breath, he sees\n\np. 320\n\nBrahman by discrimination (tarka). And when, after the cessation of mind 1, he\nsees his own Self, smaller than small, and shining, as the Highest Self 2,\nthen having seen his Self as the Self, he becomes Self-less, and because he is\nSelf-less, he is without limit, without cause, absorbed in thought. This is\nthe highest mystery, viz. final liberation. And thus it is said:\n\n\'Through the serenity of the thought he kills all actions, good or bad; his\nSelf serene, abiding in the Self, obtains imperishable bliss.\'\n\n2 1. And thus it has been said elsewhere: The artery, called Sushumna, going\nupwards (from the heart to the Brahmarandhra), serving as the passage of the\nPra _n_ a, is divided within the palate. Through that artery, when it has been\njoined by the breath (held in subjection), by the sacred syllable Om, and by\nthe mind (absorbed in the contemplation of Brahman), let him proceed upwards\n3, and after turning the tip of the tongue to the palate, without 4 using any\nof the organs of sense, let greatness perceive greatness 5. From thence he\ngoes to selflessness, and through selflessness he ceases to be an enjoyer of\npleasure and pain, he obtains aloneness (kevalatva, final deliverance). And\nthus it is said:\n\np. 321\n\n\'Having successively fixed the breath, after it had been restrained, in the\npalate, thence having crossed the limit (the life), let him join himself\nafterwards to the limitless (Brahman) in the crown of the head.\'\n\n22\\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: Two Brahmans have to be meditated\non, the word and the non-word. By the word alone is the non-word revealed. Now\nthere is the word Om. Moving upward by it (where all words and all what is\nmeant by them ceases), he arrives at absorption in the non-word (Brahman).\nThis is the way, this is the immortal, this is union, and this is bliss. And\nas the spider, moving upward by the thread, gains free space, thus also he who\nmeditates, moving upward by the syllable Om, gains independence.\n\nOther teachers of the word (as Brahman) think otherwise. They listen to the\nsound of the ether within the heart while they stop the ears with the thumbs.\nThey compare it to seven noises, like rivers, like a bell, like a brazen\nvessel, like the wheels of a carriage, like the croaking of frogs, like rain,\nand as if a man speaks in a cavern. Having passed beyond this variously\napprehended sound, and having settled in the supreme, soundless (non-word),\nunmanifested Brahman, they become undistinguished and undistinguishable, as\nvarious flavours of the flowers are lost in the taste of honey. And thus it is\nsaid:\n\n\'Two Brahmans are to be known, the word-Brahman and the highest Brahman; he\nwho is perfect in the word-Brahman attains the highest Brahman 1.\'\n\np. 322\n\n23\\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: The syllable Om is what is called\nthe word. And its end is the silent, the soundless, fearless, sorrowless,\njoyful, satisfied, firm, unwavering, immortal, immovable, certain (Brahman),\ncalled Vish _n_ u. Let him worship these two, that he may obtain what is\nhigher than everything (final deliverance). For thus it is said:\n\n\'He who is the high and the highest god 1, by name Om-kara, he is soundless\nand free from all distinctions: therefore let a man dwell on him in the crown\nof his head.\'\n\n24\\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: The body is the bow, the syllable Om\nis the arrow, its point is the mind. Having cut through the darkness, which\nconsists of ignorance 2, it approaches that which is not covered by darkness\n3. Then having cut through that which was covered (the personal soul), he saw\nBrahman, flashing like a wheel on fire, bright like the sun, vigorous, beyond\nall darkness, that which shines forth in yonder sun, in the moon, in the fire,\nin the lightning 4. And having seen him, he obtains immortality. And thus it\nhas been said:\n\n\'Meditation is directed to the highest Being (Brahman) within, and (before) to\nthe objects (body, Om, mind); thence the indistinct understanding becomes\ndistinct.\n\nAnd when the works of the mind are dissolved,\n\np. 323\n\nthen that bliss which requires no other witness, that is Brahman (\xc3\x82tman), the\nimmortal, the brilliant, that is the way, that is the (true) world.\'\n\n25\\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: He who has his senses hidden as in\nsleep, and who, while in the cavern of his senses (his body), but no longer\nruled by them, sees, as in a dream, with the purest intellect, Him who is\ncalled Pra _n_ ava (Om), the leader 1, the bright, the sleepless, free from\nold age, from death, and sorrow, he is himself also called Pra _n_ ava, and\nbecomes a leader, bright, sleepless, free from old age, from death, and\nsorrow. And thus it is said:\n\n\'Because in this manner he joins the Pra _n_ a (breath), the Om, and this\nUniverse in its manifold forms, or because they join themselves (to him),\ntherefore this (process of meditation) is called Yoga (joining).\n\nThe oneness of breath, mind, and senses, and then the surrendering of all\nconceptions, that is called Yoga.\'\n\n26\\. And thus it has also been said elsewhere: As a sportsman, after drawing\nout the denizens of the waters with a net, offers them (as a sacrifice) in the\nfire of his stomach, thus are these Pra _n_ as (vital airs), after they have\nbeen drawn out with the syllable Om, offered in the faultless fire (Brahman)\n2.\n\nHence he is like a heated vessel (full of clarified butter); for as the\nclarified butter in the heated vessel lights up, when touched with grass and\nsticks, thus does this being which is called Not-breath (\xc3\x82tman) light up, when\ntouched by the Pra _n_ as (the\n\np. 324\n\nvital airs) 1. And that which flares up, that is the manifest form of Brahman,\nthat is the highest place of Vish _n_ u 2, that is the essence of Rudra. And\nthis, dividing his Self in endless ways, fills all these worlds. And thus it\nis said:\n\n\'As the sparks from the fire, and as the rays from the sun, thus do his Pra\n_n_ as and the rest in proper order again and again proceed from him here on\nearth 3.\'\n\n27\\. And thus it has also been said elsewhere: This is the heat of the\nhighest, the immortal, the incorporeal Brahman, viz. the warmth of the body.\nAnd this body is the clarified butter (poured on it, by which the heat of\nBrahman, otherwise invisible, is lighted up). Then, being manifest, it is\nplaced in the ether (of the heart). Then by concentration they thus remove\nthat ether which is within the heart, so that its light appears, as it were 4.\nTherefore the worshipper becomes identified with that light without much\ndelay. As a ball of iron, if placed in the earth, becomes earth without much\ndelay, and as, when it has once become a clod of earth, fire and smiths have\nnothing more to do with that ball of iron, thus does thought (without delay)\ndisappear, together with its support 5. And thus it is said:\n\np. 325\n\n\'The shrine which consists of the ether in the heart, the blissful, the\nhighest retreat, that is our own, that is our goal, and that is the heat and\nbrightness of the fire and the sun.\'\n\n28\\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: After having left behind the body,\nthe organs of sense, and the objects of sense (as no longer belonging to us),\nand having seized the bow whose stick is fortitude and whose string is\nasceticism, having struck down also with the arrow, which consists in freedom\nfrom egotism, the first guardian of the door of Brahman (for if man looks at\nthe world egotistically, then, taking the diadem of passion, the earrings of\ngreed and envy, and the staff of sloth, sleep, and sin, and having seized the\nbow whose string is anger, and whose stick is lust, he destroys with the arrow\nwhich consists of wishes, all beings)--having therefore killed that guardian,\nhe crosses by means of the boat Om to the other side of the ether within the\nheart, and when the ether becomes revealed (as Brahman), he enters slowly, as\na miner seeking minerals in a mine, into the Hall of Brahman. After that let\nhim, by means of the doctrine of his teacher, break through the shrine of\nBrahman, which consists of the four nets (of food, breath, mind, knowledge,\ntill he reaches the last shrine, that of blessedness and identity with\nBrahman). Thenceforth pure,\n\np. 326\n\nclean, undeveloped, tranquil, breathless, bodiless, endless, imperishable,\nfirm, everlasting, unborn and independent, he stands on his own greatness 1,\nand having seen (the Self), standing in his own greatness, he looks on the\nwheel of the world as one (who has alighted from a chariot) looks on its\nrevolving wheel. And thus it is said:\n\n\'If a man practises Yoga for six months and is thoroughly free (from the outer\nworld), then the perfect Yoga (union), which is endless, high, and hidden, is\naccomplished.\n\nBut if a man, though well enlightened (by instruction), is still pierced by\n(the gu _n_ as of) passion and darkness, and attached to his children, wife,\nand house, then perfect Yoga is never accomplished 2.\'\n\n29\\. After he had thus spoken (to B _ri_ hadratha), _S_ akayanya, absorbed in\nthought, bowed before him, and said: \'O King, by means of this Brahma-\nknowledge have the sons of Pra _g_ apati (the Valakhilyas) gone to the road of\nBrahman. Through the practice of Yoga a man obtains contentment, power to\nendure good and evil, and tranquillity. Let no man preach this most secret\ndoctrine to any one who is not his son or his pupil 3, and who is not of a\nserene mind. To him alone who is devoted to his teacher only, and endowed with\nall necessary qualities, may he communicate it 4.\n\np. 327\n\n30\\. Om! Having settled down in a pure place let him, being pure himself, and\nfirm in goodness, study the truth, speak the truth, think the truth, and offer\nsacrifice to the truth 1. Henceforth he has become another; by obtaining the\nreward of Brahman his fetters are cut asunder, he knows no hope, no fear from\nothers as little as from himself, he knows no desires; and having attained\nimperishable, infinite happiness, he stands blessed in the true Brahman, who\nlongs for a true man 2. Freedom from desires is, as it were, the highest prize\nto be taken from the best treasure (Brahman). For a man full of all desires,\nbeing possessed of will, imagination, and belief, is a slave; but he who is\nthe opposite, is free.\n\nHere some say, it is the Gu _n_ a 3 (i. e. the so-called Mahat, the principle\nof intellect which, according to the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khyas, is the result of the Gu _n_ as\nor qualities), which, through the differences of nature (acquired in the\nformer states of existence), goes into bondage to the will, and that\ndeliverance takes place (for the Gu _n_ a) when the fault of the will has been\nremoved. (But this is not our view), because (call it gu _n_ a, intellect,\nbuddhi, manas, mind, aha\xe1\xb9\x85kara, egotism, it is not the mind that acts, but) he\nsees by the mind (as his instrument), he hears by the mind; and all that we\ncall\n\np. 328\n\ndesire, imagination, doubt, belief, unbelief, certainty, uncertainty, shame,\nthought, fear, all that is but mind (manas). Carried along by the waves of the\nqualities, darkened in his imaginations, unstable, fickle, crippled, full of\ndesires, vacillating, he enters into belief, believing I am he, this is mine,\nand he binds his Self by his Self, as a bird with a net 1. Therefore a man,\nbeing possessed of will, imagination, and belief, is a slave, but he who is\nthe opposite is free. For this reason let a man stand free from will,\nimagination, and belief--this is the sign of liberty, this is the path that\nleads to Brahman, this is the opening of the door, and through it he will go\nto the other shore of darkness. All desires are there fulfilled. And for this\nthey quote a verse:\n\n" When the five instruments of knowledge stand still together with the mind,\nand when the intellect does not move, that is called the highest state 2."\'\n\nHaving thus said, Sakayanya became absorbed in thought. Then Marut (i.e. the\nKing B _ri_ hadratha) 3, having bowed before him and duly worshipped him, went\nfull of contentment to the Northern Path 4, for there is no way thither by any\nside-road. This is the path to Brahman. Having burst open the solar door, he\nrose on high and went away. And here they quote:\n\n\'There are endless rays (arteries) for the Self who, like a lamp, dwells in\nthe heart: white and black, brown and blue, tawny and reddish 5.\n\np. 329\n\nOne of them (the Sushumna) leads upwards, piercing the solar orb: by it,\nhaving stepped beyond the world of Brahman, they go to the highest path.\n\nThe other hundred rays 1 rise upwards also, and on them the worshipper reaches\nthe mansions belonging to the different bodies of gods.\n\nBut the manifest rays of dim colour which lead downwards, by them a man\ntravels on and on helplessly, to enjoy the fruits of his actions here.\'\n\nTherefore it is said that the holy \xc3\x82ditya (sun) is the cause of new births (to\nthose who do not worship him), of heaven (to those who worship him as a god),\nof liberty (to those who worship him as Brahman) 2.\n\n31\\. Some one asks: \'Of what nature are those organs of sense that go forth\n(towards their objects)? Who sends them out here, or who holds them back?\'\n\nAnother answers: \'Their nature is the Self; the Self sends them out, or holds\nthem back; also the Apsaras (enticing objects of sense), and the solar rays\n(and other deities presiding over the senses).\'\n\nNow the Self devours the objects by the five rays (the organs of sense); then\nwho is the Self?\n\nHe who has been defined by the terms pure, clean, undeveloped, tranquil 3,\n&c., who is to be apprehended independently by his own peculiar signs. That\nsign of him who has no signs, is like what the pervading\n\np. 330\n\nheat is of fire, the purest taste of water; thus say some 1. It is speech,\nhearing, sight, mind, breath; thus say others 2. It is intellect, retention,\nremembering, knowledge; thus say others 3. Now all these are signs of the Self\nin the same sense in which here on earth shoots are the signs of seed, or\nsmoke, light, and sparks of fire. And for this they quote 4:\n\n\'As the sparks from the fire, and as the rays from the sun, thus do his Pra\n_n_ as and the rest in proper order again and again proceed from him here on\nearth.\'\n\n32\\. From this very Self, abiding within his Self, come forth all Pra _n_ as\n(speech, &c.), all worlds, all Vedas, all gods, and all beings; its Upanishad\n(revelation) 5 is that it is \'the true of the true.\' Now as from a fire of\ngreen wood, when kindled, clouds of smoke come forth by themselves (though\nbelonging to the fire), thus from that great Being has been breathed forth all\nthis which is the _Ri_ g-veda, the Ya _g_ ur-veda, the Sama-veda, the\nAtharva\xe1\xb9\x85girasas (Atharva-veda), the Itihasa (legendary stories), the Pura _n_\na (accounts of the creation, &c.), Vidya (ceremonial doctrines), the\nUpanishads, the _S_ lokas (verses interspersed in the Upanishads, &c.), the\nSutras (compendious statements), the Anuvyakhyanas (explanatory notes), the\nVyakhyanas (elucidations) 6\\--all these things are his.\n\np. 331\n\n33\\. This fire (the Garhapatya-fire) with five bricks is the year. And its\nfive bricks are spring, summer, rainy season, autumn, winter; and by them the\nfire has a head, two sides, a centre, and a tail. This earth (the Garhapatya-\nfire) here is the first sacrificial pile for Pra _g_ apati, who knows the\nPurusha (the Vira _g_ ). It presented the sacrificer to Vayu, (the wind) by\nlifting him with the hands to the sky. That Vayu is Pra _n_ a (Hira _n_\nyagarbha).\n\nPra _n_ a is Agni (the Dakshi _n_ agni-fire), and its bricks are the five\nvital breaths, Pra _n_ a, Vyana, Apana, Samana, Udana; and by them the fire\nhas a head, two sides, a centre, and a tail. This sky (the Dakshi _n_ agni-\nfire) here is the second sacrificial pile for Pra _g_ apati, who knows the\nPurusha. It presented the sacrificer to Indra, by lifting him with the hands\nto heaven. That Indra is \xc3\x82ditya, the sun.\n\nThat (Indra) is the Agni (the \xc3\x82havaniya-fire), and its bricks are the _Ri_ _k_\n, the Ya _g_ ush, the Saman, the Atharva\xe1\xb9\x85girasas, the Itihasa, and the Pura\n_n_ a; and by them the fire has a head, two sides, a tail, and a centre. This\nheaven (\xc3\x82havaniya-fire) is the third sacrificial pile for Pra _g_ apati, who\nknows the\n\np. 332\n\n[paragraph continues] Purusha. With the hands it makes a present of the\nsacrificer to the Knower of the Self (Pra _g_ apati); then the Knower of the\nSelf, lifting him up, presented him to Brahman. In him he becomes full of\nhappiness and joy.\n\n34\\. The earth is the Garhapatya-fire, the sky the Dakshina-fire, the heaven\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya-fire; and therefore they are also the Pavamana (pure), the\nPavaka (purifying), and the _S_ u _k_ i (bright) 1. By this (by the three\ndeities, Pavamana, Pavaka, and _S_ u _k_ i) the sacrifice (of the three fires,\nthe Garhapatya, Dakshi _n_ a, and \xc3\x82havaniya) is manifested. And because the\ndigestive fire also is a compound of the Pavamana, Pavaka, and _S_ u _k_ i,\ntherefore that fire is to receive oblations, is to be laid with bricks, is to\nbe praised, and to be meditated on. The sacrificer, when he has seized the\noblation, wishes 2 to perform his meditation of the deity:\n\n\'The gold-coloured bird abides in the heart, and in the sun--a diver bird, a\nswan, strong in splendour; him we worship in the fire.\'\n\nHaving recited the verse, he discovers its meaning, viz. the adorable\nsplendour of Savit _ri_ (sun) is to be meditated on by him who, abiding within\nhis mind, meditates thereon. Here he attains the place of rest for the mind,\nhe holds it within his own Self. On this there are the following verses:\n\n(1) As a fire without fuel becomes quiet in its\n\np. 333\n\nplace 1, thus do the thoughts, when all activity ceases, become quiet 2 in\ntheir place.\n\n(2) Even in a mind which loves the truth 3 and has gone to rest in itself\nthere arise, when it is deluded by the objects of sense, wrongs resulting from\nformer acts 4.\n\n(3) For thoughts alone cause the round of births 5; let a man strive to purify\nhis thoughts. What a man thinks, that he is: this is the old secret 6.\n\n(4) By the serenity of his thoughts a man blots out all actions, whether good\nor bad. Dwelling within his Self with serene thoughts, he obtains imperishable\nhappiness.\n\n(5) If the thoughts of a man were so fixed on Brahman as they are on the\nthings of this world, who would not then be freed from bondage?\n\n(6) The mind, it is said, is of two kinds, pure or impure; impure from the\ncontact with lust, pure when free from lust 7.\n\n(7) When a man, having freed his mind from sloth, distraction, and\nvacillation, becomes as it were delivered from his mind 8, that is the highest\npoint.\n\n(8) The mind must be restrained in the heart till it comes to an end;--that is\nknowledge, that is liberty: all the rest are extensions of the ties 9 (which\nbind us to this life).\n\np. 334\n\n(9) That happiness which belongs to a mind which by deep meditation has been\nwashed 1 clean from all impurity and has entered within the Self, cannot be\ndescribed here by words; it can be felt by the inward power only 2.\n\n(10) Water in water, fire in fire, ether in ether, no one can distinguish\nthem; likewise a man whose mind has entered (till it cannot be distinguished\nfrom the Self), attains liberty.\n\n(11) Mind alone is the cause of bondage and liberty for men; if attached to\nthe world, it becomes bound; if free from the world, that is liberty 3.\n\nTherefore those who do not offer the Agnihotra (as described above), who do\nnot lay the fires (with the bricks, as described above), who are ignorant (of\nthe mind being the cause of the round of births), who do not meditate (on the\nSelf in the solar orb) are debarred from remembering the ethereal place of\nBrahman. Therefore that fire is to receive oblations, is to be laid with\nbricks, is to be praised, to be meditated on.\n\n35 4. Adoration to Agni, the dweller on earth, who remembers his world. Grant\nthat world to this thy worshipper!\n\nAdoration to Vayu, the dweller in the sky, who remembers his world. Grant that\nworld to this thy worshipper!\n\np. 335\n\nAdoration to \xc3\x82ditya, the dweller in heaven, who remembers his world. Grant\nthat world to this thy worshipper!\n\nAdoration to Brahman, who dwells everywhere, who remembers all. Grant all to\nthis thy worshipper!\n\nThe mouth of the true (Brahman) is covered with a golden lid; open that, O\nPushan (sun), that we may go to the true one, who pervades all (Vish _n_ u) 1.\n\nHe who is the person in the sun, I am he 2.\n\nAnd what is meant by the true one is the essence of the sun, that which is\nbright, personal, sexless 3; a portion (only) of the light which pervades the\nether; which is, as it were, in the midst of the sun, and in the eye, and in\nthe fire. That is Brahman, that is immortal, that is splendour.\n\nThat is the true one, a portion (only) of the light which pervades the ether,\nwhich is in the midst of the sun, the immortal, of which Soma (the moon) and\nthe vital breaths also are offshoots: that is Brahman, that is immortal, that\nis splendour.\n\nThat is the true one, a portion (only) of the light which pervades the ether,\nwhich in the midst of the sun shines as Ya _g_ us, viz. as Om, as water,\nlight, essence, immortal, Brahman, Bhu _h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Svar, Om.\n\n\'The eight-footed 4, the bright, the swan, bound\n\np. 336\n\nwith three threads, the infinitely small, the imperishable, blind for good and\nevil, kindled with light--he who sees him, sees everything.\'\n\nA portion (only) of the light which pervades the ether, are the two rays\nrising in the midst of the sun. That is the knower 1 (the Sun), the true one.\nThat is the Ya _g_ us, that is the heat, that is Agni (fire), that is Vayu\n(wind), that is breath, that is water, that is the moon, that is bright, that\nis immortal, that is the place of Brahman, that is the ocean of light. In that\nocean the sacrificers are dissolved 2 like salt, and that is oneness with\nBrahman, for all desires are there fulfilled. And here they quote:\n\n\'Like a lamp, moved by a gentle wind, he who dwells within the gods shines\nforth. He who knows this, he is the knower, he knows the difference (between\nthe high and the highest Brahman); having obtained unity, he becomes\nidentified with it.\n\nThey who rise up in endless number, like spray drops (from the sea), like\nlightnings from the light within the clouds in the highest heaven, they, when\nthey have entered into the light of glory (Brahman), appear like so many\nflame-crests in the track of fire.\'\n\n36\\. There are two manifestations of the Brahma-light: one is tranquil, the\nother lively. Of that which is tranquil, the ether is the support; of that\nwhich is lively, food. Therefore (to the former) sacrifice must be offered on\nthe house-altar with hymns, herbs, ghee, meat, cakes, sthalipaka, and other\nthings; to the latter, with meat and drinks (belonging to the great\nsacrifices) thrown into the mouth, for the mouth\n\np. 337\n\nis the \xc3\x82havaniya-fire; and this is done to increase our bodily vigour, to gain\nthe world of purity, and for the sake of immortality. And here they quote:\n\n\'Let him who longs for heaven, offer an Agnihotra. By an Agnish _t_ oma he\nwins the kingdom of Yama; by Uktha, the kingdom of Soma; by a Sho _d_ asin-\nsacrifice, the kingdom of Surya; by an Atiratra-sacrifice, the kingdom of\nIndra; by the sacrifices beginning with the twelve-night sacrifice and ending\nwith the thousand years\' sacrifice, the world of Pra _g_ apati.\n\nAs a lamp burns so long as the vessel that holds the wick is filled with oil,\nthese two, the Self and the bright Sun, remain so long as the egg (of the\nworld) and he who dwells within it hold together.\'\n\n37\\. Therefore let a man perform all these ceremonies with the syllable Om (at\nthe beginning). Its splendour is endless, and it is declared to be threefold,\nin the fire (of the altar), in the sun (the deity), in the breath (the\nsacrificer). Now this is the channel to increase the food, which makes what is\noffered in the fire ascend to the sun. The sap which flows from thence, rains\ndown as with the sound of a hymn. \'By it there are vital breaths, from them\nthere is offspring. And here they quote:\n\n\'The offering which is offered in the fire, goes to the sun; the sun rains it\ndown by his rays; thus food comes, and from food the birth of living beings\n1.\'\n\nAnd thus he said:\n\n\'The oblation which is properly thrown on the fire, goes toward the sun; from\nthe sun comes rain, from rain food, from food living beings\'.\'\n\np. 338\n\n38\\. He who offers the Agnihotra breaks through the net of desire. Then,\ncutting through bewilderment, never approving of anger, meditating on one\ndesire (that of liberty), he breaks through the shrine of Brahman with its\nfour nets, and proceeds thence to the ether. For having there broken through\nthe (four) spheres of the Sun, the Moon, the Fire, and Goodness, he then,\nbeing purified himself, beholds dwelling in goodness, immovable, immortal,\nindestructible, firm, bearing the name of Vish _n_ u, the highest abode,\nendowed with love of truth and omniscience, the self-dependent Intelligence\n(Brahman), standing in its own greatness. And here they quote:\n\n\'In the midst of the sun stands the moon, in the midst of the moon the fire,\nin the midst of fire goodness, in the midst of goodness the Eternal.\'\n\nHaving meditated on him who has the breadth of a thumb within the span (of the\nheart) in the body, who is smaller than small, he obtains the nature of the\nHighest; there all desires are fulfilled. And on this they quote:\n\n\'Having the breadth of a thumb within the span (of the heart) in the body,\nlike the flame of a lamp, burning twofold or threefold, that glorified\nBrahman, the great God, has entered into all the worlds. Om! Adoration to\nBrahman! Adoration!\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[305:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1038) The commentator describes the sixth and seventh\nchapters as Khila, supplementary, and does not think that they are closely\nconnected with the chief object of the Upanishad. This chief object was to\nshow that there is only one thinking Self ( _k_ idatma) to be known, and that\nthe same is to be meditated on as manifested in the different forms of Rudra,\nBrahma, Vish _n_ u, &c. Thus the highest object of those who wish for final\nliberation has been explained before, as well as the proper means of obtaining\nthat liberation. What follows are statements of the greatness of the various\nmanifestations of the \xc3\x82tman, and advice how to worship them. My MS. gives the\nbeginning of the sixth Prapa _th_ aka, but ends with the end of the eighth\nparagraph. The verses in paragraph 34, as mentioned before, are given in my\nMS. at the end of the fourth Prapa _th_ aka. My translation deviates\nconsiderably from the commentary. The text is obscure and not always correct.\nMy rule has been throughout to begin a new sentence with eva _m_ hy aha, \'for\nthus it is said,\' which introduces proofs of what has been said before. The\npassages thus quoted as proofs from the Veda are often difficult to\nunderstand, nor do they always consist of a complete sentence.

The Savitri is\nfound in _Ri_ g-veda III, 6 2, 10, but it is here explained in a purely\nphilosophical sense. See also B _ri_ h. Up. VI, 3, 6.\n\n[310:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1066) M. reads tarake \'ksh _n_ i.\n\n[310:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1067) Surya is considered as the daily performer of\nthe Prata _h_ savana, &c., the sacrifice at which Soma is squeezed out as an\noffering.\n\n[310:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1068) M. reads pavamanat pavamana _h_.\n\n[310:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1069) M. reads am _ri_ takhya _s_ _k_ etakhya _s_ _k_\neta.\n\n[310:5](sbe15117.htm#fr_1070) M. reads ganta s _ri_ sh _t_ a.\n\n[311:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1071) M. reads karyak\xc4\x83ra _n_ akarmavinirmuktam.\n\n[311:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1072) Nirupakhyam, rightly translated by Cowell by\n\'without a predicate,\' and rendered by the commentator by apramaya, i.e. not\nto be measured, not to be classed, i.e. without a predicate.\n\n[311:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1073) I have translated this in accordance with a\nwell-known passage, quoted by the commentator from the B _ri_ hadaranyaka,\nrather than in accordance with his own interpretation.\n\n[311:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1074) M. leaves out vidhata.\n\n[311:5](sbe15117.htm#fr_1075) Instead of the peculiar Maitraya _n_ i reading,\nsva _\xc3\xb1_ _s_ arirad, AI. reads sva _s_ _kh_ arirad.\n\n[311:6](sbe15117.htm#fr_1076) The oneness of the Sun and the Breath is\nproclaimed in the following verse of the Pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ a Upanishad I, 8.\n\n[312:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1077) Here ends the M. manuscript, with the following\ntitle: iti _s_ riya _g_ u _s_ _s_ akhayam Maitraya _n_ iyabrahma _n_\nopanishadi shash _th_ a _h_ prapa _th_ aka _h_. Samapta.\n\n[312:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1078) In the following paragraphs the taking of food\nis represented as a sacrifice offered by the Self to the Self (atmaya _g_\nanarupam bho _g_ anam, p. 106, l. 13).\n\n[312:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1079) Several words have been inserted in this verse,\nspoiling the metre.\n\n[312:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1080) See _Kh_ and. Up. V, 2.\n\n[313:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1081) See before, III, 3.\n\n[313:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1082) This is very doubtful, in fact, unintelligible.\nThe commentator says, asya bhutatmana _h_ karta pradhana _h_ purvokta _h_ , so\n\'pi bho _g_ ya ity artha _h_.\n\n[313:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1083) Technical terms, afterwards adopted by the\nSa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophers.\n\n[313:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1084) Professor Cowell observes that the term vi _s_\nesha, as here applied to the five gross elements, occurs in the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya-\nkarika, ver. 38.\n\n[314:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1085) Five receptive, five active organs, and four\nkinds of consciousness.\n\n[314:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1086) Its very development proves it to be food.\nCowell.\n\n[315:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1087) _Kh_ and. Up. VII, 9, 1.\n\n[315:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1088) Taitt. Up. II, 2.\n\n[316:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1089) As food depends on time, therefore time is\npraised, which again depends on the sun, which is a form of the Self.\n\n[317:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1090) Thus, the commentator says, the existence of the\nlamp can be proved by the light of the lamp, as the existence of time is\nproved by what we see, the rising of the sun. All this is very obscure.\n\n[318:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1091) Brahman used as neuter, but immediately followed\nby eko \'nanta _h_ , &c.\n\n[318:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1092) After having explained the form of what is to be\nmeditated on and the mode of meditation, the Upanishad now teaches the Yoga\nwhich serves to keep our thoughts in subjection, and to fix our thoughts on\nthe object of meditation. See Yoga-Sutras II, 29.\n\n[319:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1093) The fourth stage is meant for the thinking Self,\nthe earlier stages being waking, slumbering, and sleep.\n\n[319:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1094) Professor Cowell offers two renderings of this\ndifficult passage: \'This which is called pra _n_ a, i.e. the individual soul\nas characterised by the subtil body, will thus no longer appear in its\nseparate individuality from the absence of any conscious subject; or, this\nsubtil body bearing the name of intellect will thus become void of all\nobjects.\'\n\n[320:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1095) The commentator remarks that this process is\ncalled Lambikayoga, and the state produced by it Unmani or Unmanibhava; see\namanibhava, in VI, 34, ver. 7.\n\n[320:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1096) I should have preferred to translate atmanam\natmana pa _s_ yati by \'he sees his Self by his Self,\' but the commentator\ntakes a slightly different view, and says itthambhave t _ri_ tiya;\nparamatmarupe _n_ a pa _s_ yati.\n\n[320:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1097) Cf. Ka _th_ a Up. V I, 16 Pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ a Up. III,\n6 (p. 277).\n\n[320:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1098) If we read sa _m_ yo _g_ ya we must follow the\ncommentator in translating by \'uniting the senses with the pra _n_ a and the\nmanas.\'\n\n[320:5](sbe15117.htm#fr_1099) Let the Self perceive the Self.\n\n[321:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1100) Cf. Mahabharata XII, 8540; Sarvadar _s_ ana-\nsa\xe1\xb9\x85graha, p. 147; Cowell\'s Translation, p. 271.\n\n[322:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1101) The commentator takes deva as deva _h_ , though\nthe accent is against it; see Schroeder, \xc3\x9cber die Maitraya _n_ i Sa _m_ hita,\np. 9, l. 11.\n\n[322:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1102) Should it not be, \'darkness is the mark?\'\n\n[322:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1103) Atamavish _t_ a, explained as an irregular\ncompound, atama-avish _t_ am, tama-ave _s_ anarahitam.\n\n[322:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1104) Cf. Bhagavadgita XV, 12.\n\n[323:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1105) Cf.

Or, as the clarified butter, heated together with the vessel,\nlights up grass that comes in contact with it, so does this \xc3\x82tman (called Not-\nbreath), by heating its two bodies which are pervaded by the reflections of\nthe thinker, light up everything brought in contact with it, viz. the world.\n\n[324:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1108) See Ka _th_ a Up. III, 9.\n\n[324:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1109) See VI, 31; B _ri_ h. Up. II, 1, 10.\n\n[324:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1110) The light was always there, but it seems then\nonly to appear.\n\n[324:5](sbe15117.htm#fr_1111) The commentator explains this differently. He\nsays that the p. 325 similes are intended to show how, as soon as the\nimpediment is removed, the worshipper obtains his true form, i.e. becomes\nBrahman. Afterwards he explains _k_ ittam, thought, by the individual thinker,\nand declares that he vanishes together with the thought, which forms the a _s_\nraya, the place, or the upadhi, the outward form. Or again, he says that the\n_k_ itta, the mind, vanishes with its outward sign, viz. the thoughts and\nimaginations.\n\n[326:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1112) See Maitr. Up. II, 4; VI, 31.\n\n[326:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1113) This would seem to have been the end of the\ndialogue between Pra _g_ apati and the Valakhilyas, which, as related by _S_\nakayanya to King B _ri_ hadratha, began in II, 3. See, however, VII, 8.\n\n[326:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1114) _S_ vet. Up. VI, 22 (p. 267); B _ri_ h. Up.

VIII, 6.\n\n[329:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1124) A similar verse, but with characteristic\nvariations, occurs in the _Kh_ and. Up. VIII, 6, 6, and in the Ka _th_ a Up.\nVI, 16.\n\n[329:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1125) Here ends the story of _S_ akayanya, which began\nI, 2, and was carried on through chap. VI, though that chapter and the seventh\nare called Khilas, or supplements, and though the MS. M. also ends, as we saw,\nwith the eighth paragraph of the sixth chapter.\n\n[329:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1126) See before, II, 4; VI, 13\n\n[330:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1127) See _S_ vet. Up.

Here we find dh _ri_ ti\n(holding), sm _ri_ ti (remembering), pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anam (knowledge), but not\nbuddhi. Pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anam seems the right reading, and is supported by M.\n\n[330:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1130) See before, VI, 26.\n\n[330:5](sbe15117.htm#fr_1131) Revelation is here the rendering of Upanishad,\nupanigamayit _ri_ tvat sakshadrahasyam, and the true (sattya) is explained\nfirst by the five elements, and then by that which is their real essence.\n\n[330:6](sbe15117.htm#fr_1132) See _Kh_ and. Up. VI, 1. The explanations given\nof these literary p. 331 titles are on the whole the same as those we had\nbefore in similar passages. What is peculiar to Ramatirtha is that he explains\nUpanishad by such passages as we had just now, viz. its Upanishad is that it\nis the true of the true. The _S_ lokas are, explained as verses like those in\nVI, 19, a _k_ itta _m_ _k_ ittamadhyastham. The Sutras are explained as\ncomprehensive sentences, such as II, 2, aya _m_ vava khalv atma te.\nAnuvyakhyanas are taken as explanations following on the Sutra in II, 2,\nbeginning with atha ya esho _k_ _kh_ vasavish _t_ ambhanena. The Vyakhyanas\nare taken as fuller statements of the meaning contained in the Sutra, such as\nthe dialogue between the Valakhilyas and Kratu.\n\n[332:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1133) Epithets of Agni, the sacrificial-fire, pavamana\napplying to the Garhapatya-fire, pavaka to the Dakshi _n_ a-fire, and _s_ u\n_k_ i to the \xc3\x82havaniya-fire.

Ind. Stud. II, 60. Brahmavindu Up. v. 1,\nwhere we read kamasa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpam, as in MS.

The\ncommentator says that p. 334 this line is easy, but it is so by no means.\nProfessor Cowell translates granthavistara _h_ by book-prolixity, but this\nsounds very strange in an Upanishad. I am not satisfied with my own\ntranslation, but it may stand till a better one is found. M. reads g _ri_\nndhavistara _h_. The granthis are mentioned in _Kh_ and. Up. VII, 26; Ka _th_.\nUp. VI, 15.\n\n[334:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1144) M. reads nirdhuta.\n\n[334:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1145) M. reads kara _n_ eti.\n\n[334:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1146) M. reads vishayasaktam muktyai.\n\n[334:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1147) Next follow invocations to be addressed to the\ndeities.\n\n[335:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1148) The verse occurs in a more original form in Tal.\nUp. 15.\n\n[335:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1149) The commentator adds iti after aham.\n\n[335:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1150) _Kh_ and.
