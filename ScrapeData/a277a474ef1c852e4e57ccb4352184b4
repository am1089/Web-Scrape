'There is a town with eleven 1 gates belonging to the Unborn (Brahman),\nwhose thoughts are never crooked. He who approaches it, grieves no more, and\nliberated (from all bonds of ignorance) becomes free. This is that.'\n\n2\\. 'He (Brahman) 2 is the swan (sun), dwelling in the bright heaven; he is\nthe Vasu (air), dwelling in the sky; he is the sacrificer (fire), dwelling on\nthe hearth; he is the guest (Soma), dwelling in the sacrificial jar; he dwells\nin men, in gods (vara), in the sacrifice ( _ri_ ta), in heaven; he is born in\nthe water, on earth, in the sacrifice ( _ri_ ta), on the mountains; he is the\nTrue and the Great.'\n\n3\\. 'He (Brahman) it is who sends up the breath (pra _n_ a), and who throws\nback the breath (apana). All the Devas (senses) worship him, the adorable (or\nthe dwarf), who sits in the centre.'\n\n4\\. 'When that incorporated (Brahman), who dwells in the body, is torn away\nand freed from the body, what remains then? This is that.'\n\n5\\. 'No mortal lives by the breath that goes up and by the breath that goes\ndown. We live by another, in whom these two repose.'\n\n6\\. 'Well then, O Gautama, I shall tell thee this mystery, the old Brahman,\nand what happens to the Self, after reaching death.'\n\np. 19\n\n7\\. 'Some enter the womb in order to have a body, as organic beings, others go\ninto inorganic matter, according to their work and according to their\nknowledge 1.'\n\n8\\. 'He, the highest Person, who is awake in us while we are asleep, shaping\none lovely sight after another, that indeed is the Bright, that is Brahman,\nthat alone is called the Immortal. All worlds are contained in it, and no one\ngoes beyond. This is that 2.'\n\n9\\. 'As the one fire, after it has entered the world, though one, becomes\ndifferent according to whatever it burns, thus the one Self within all things\nbecomes different, according to whatever it enters, and exists also without\n3.'\n\n10\\. 'As the one air, after it has entered the world, though one, becomes\ndifferent according to whatever it enters, thus the one Self within all things\nbecomes different, according to whatever it enters, and exists also without.'\n\n11\\. 'As the sun, the eye of the whole world, is not contaminated by the\nexternal impurities seen by the eyes, thus the one Self within all things is\nnever contaminated by the misery of the world, being himself without 4.'\n\n12\\. 'There is one ruler, the Self within all things, who makes the one form\nmanifold. The wise who perceive him within their Self, to them belongs eternal\nhappiness, not to others 5.'\n\n13\\. 'There is one eternal thinker, thinking non-eternal\n\np. 20\n\nthoughts, who, though one, fulfils the desires of many. The wise who perceive\nhim within their Self, to them belongs eternal peace, not to others 1.'\n\n14\\. 'They perceive that highest indescribable pleasure, saying, This is that.\nHow then can I understand it? Has it its own light, or does it reflect light?'\n\n15\\. 'The sun does not shine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor these\nlightnings, and much less this fire. When he shines, everything shines after\nhim; by his light all this is lighted 2.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[18:1](sbe15014.htm#fr_123) Seven apertures in the head, the navel, two below,\nand the one at the top of the head through which the Self escapes.
