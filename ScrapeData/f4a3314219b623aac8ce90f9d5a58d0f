That is to say--in the same way as the term 'Vai\n_s_ vanara,' although a common term, yet when qualified by attributes\nespecially belonging to the highest Self is known to denote the latter only as\npossessing the quality of ruling all men; so the word 'Agni' also when\nappearing in connexion with special attributes belonging to the highest Self\ndenotes that Self only. For any quality on the ground of which 'Agni' may be\netymologically explained to denote ordinary fire--as when e.g. we explain\n'agni' as he who 'agre nayati'--may also, in its highest non-conditioned\ndegree, be ascribed to the supreme Self. Another difficulty\n\np. 293\n\nremains. The passage (V, 18, 1) 'yas tv etam eva _m_ prade _s_ amatram\nabhivimanam,' &c. declares that the non-limited highest Brahman is limited by\nthe measure of the prade _s_ as, i.e. of the different spaces-heaven, ether,\nearth, &c.--which had previously been said to constitute the limbs of Vai _s_\nvanara. How is this possible?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 30. On account of definiteness; thus \xc3\x82smarathya opines](sbe48096.htm)\n\n"
