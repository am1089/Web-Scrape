But on account of twofold designation, as the snake and its coils.\n\nIt has been shown in the preceding adhikara _n_ a that\n\np. 619\n\nthe entire non-sentient universe is the outward form of Brahman. For the\npurpose of proving Brahman's freedom from all imperfection, an enquiry is now\nbegun into the particular mode in which the world may be conceived to\nconstitute the form of Brahman. Is the relation of the two like that of the\nsnake and its coils; or like that of light and the luminous body, both of\nwhich fall under the same genus; or like that of the individual soul and\nBrahman, the soul being a distinguishing attribute and for that reason a part\n(a _ms_ a) of Brahman?--On the assumption of this last alternative, which is\nabout to be established here, it has been already shown under two preceding\nSutras (I, 4, 23; II, 1, 14), that from Brahman, as distinguished by sentient\nand non-sentient beings in their subtle form, there originates Brahman as\ndistinguished by all those beings in their gross form.\n\nWhich then of the alternatives stated above is the true one?--The material\nworld is related to Brahman as the coils to the snake, 'on account of twofold\ndesignation.' For some texts declare the identity of the two: 'Brahman only is\nall this'; 'The Self only is all this.' Other texts again refer to the\ndifference of the two: 'Having entered into these three deities with this _g_\niva-self, let me differentiate names and forms.' We therefore consider all\nnon-sentient things to be special forms or arrangements of Brahman, as the\ncoils are of a coiled-up snake or a coiled-up rope.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 27.
