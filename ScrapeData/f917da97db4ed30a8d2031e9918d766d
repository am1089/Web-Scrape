Such cases occur again and again.\nThus in IX, 86, I find that Professor Aufrecht ascribes the first ten verses\nto the Ak _ri_ sh _t_ as, whereas Saya _n_ a calls them \xc3\x82k _ri_ sh _t_ as. It\nis perfectly true that the best MSS. of the Anukrama _n_ ika have Ak _ri_ sh\n_t_ a, it is equally true that the name of these Ak _ri_ sh _t_ as is spelt\nwith a short a in the Hariva _m_ sa, 11,533, but an editor of Saya _n_ a's\nwork is not to alter the occasional mistakes of that learned commentator, and\nSaya _n_ a certainly called these poets \xc3\x82k _ri_ sh _t_ as.\n\np. lxxi\n\nVerses 21-30 of the same hymn are ascribed by Professor Aufrecht to the P _ri_\n_s_ niya _h_. Here, again, several MSS. support that reading; and in Sha _d_\nguru _s_ ishya's commentary, the correction of p _ri_ _s_ niya _h_ into p _ri_\n_s_ naya _h_ is made by a later hand. But Saya _n_ a clearly took p _ri_ _s_\nnaya _h_ for a nominative plural of p _ri_ _s_ ni, and in this case he\ncertainly was right. The Dictionary of Bohtlingk and Roth quotes the\nMahabharata, VII, 8728, in support of the peculiar reading of p _ri_ _s_ niya\n_h_ , but the published text gives p _ri_ _s_ naya _h_. Professor Benfey, in\nhis list of poets (Ind. Stud. vol. iii, p. 223), gives p _ri_ _s_ niyo _g_ a\nas one word, not p _ri_ _s_ niyoga, as stated in _th_ e Dictionary of\nBohtlingk and Roth, but this is evidently meant for two words, viz. p _ri_ _s_\nnayo\xe0\xa4\xbd _g_ a _h_. However, whether p _ri_ _s_ niya _h_ or p _ri_ _s_ naya _h_\nbe the real name of these poets, an editor of Saya _n_ a is bound to give that\nreading of the name which Saya _n_ a believed to be the right one, i. e. p\n_ri_ _s_ naya _h_  a.\n\nAgain, in the same hymn, Professor Aufrecht ascribes verses 31-40 to the\nAtris. We should then have to read t _ri_ tiye\xe0\xa4\xbdtraya _h_. But Saya _n_ a read\nt _ri_ tiye traya _h_ , and ascribes verses 31-40 to the three companies\ntogether of the _Ri_ shis mentioned before. On this point the MSS. admit of no\ndoubt, for we read: _k_ aturthasya _k_ a da _s_ ar _k_ asya ak _ri_ sh _t_ a\nmasha ityadidvinamanas trayo ga _n_ a drash _t_ ara _h_. I do not say that the\nother explanation is wrong; I only say that, whether right or wrong, Saya _n_\na certainly read traya _h_ , not atraya _h_ ; and an editor of Saya _n_ a has\nno more right to correct the text, supported by the best MSS., in the first\nand second, than in the third of these passages, all taken from one and the\nsame hymn.\n\nBut though I insist so strongly on a strict observance of the rules of\ndiplomatic criticism with regard to the text Old mistakes in the text.of the\nRig-veda, nay, even of Saya _n_ a, I insist equally strongly on the right of\nindependent criticism, which ought to begin where diplomatic\n\np. lxxii\n\ncriticism ends. Considering the startling antiquity which we can claim for\nevery letter and accent of our MSS., so far as they are authenticated by the\nPrati _s_ akhya, to say nothing of the passages of many hymns which are quoted\nverbatim in the Brahma _n_ as, the Kalpa-sutras, the Nirukta, the B _ri_\nhaddevata, and the Anukrama _n_ is, I should deem it reckless to alter one\nsingle letter or one single accent in an edition of the hymns of the Rig-veda.\nAs the text has been handed down to us, so it should remain; and whatever\nalterations and corrections we, the critical Mle _k_ _kh_ as of the nineteenth\ncentury, have to propose, should be kept distinct from that time-hallowed\ninheritance. Unlikely as it may sound, it is true nevertheless that we, the\nscholars of the nineteenth century, are able to point out mistakes in the text\nof the Rig-veda which escaped the attention of the most learned among the\nnative scholars of the sixth century b.c. No doubt, these scholars, even if\nthey had perceived such mistakes, would hardly have ventured to correct the\ntext of their sacred writings. The authors of the Prati _s_ akhya had before\ntheir eyes or ears a text ready made, of which they registered every\npeculiarity, nay, in which they would note and preserve every single\nirregularity, even though it stood alone amidst hundreds of analogous cases.\nWith us the case is different. Where we see a rule observed in 99 cases, we\nfeel strongly tempted and sometimes justified in altering the 100th case in\naccordance with what we consider to be a general rule. Yet even then I feel\nconvinced we ought not to do more than place our conjectural readings below\nthe textus receptus of the Veda,--a text so ancient and venerable that no\nscholar of any historical tact or critical taste would venture to foist into\nit a conjectural reading, however plausible, nay, however undeniable.\n\nSthatu _h_ _k_ aratham.There can be no clearer case of corruption in the\ntraditional text of the Rig-veda than, for instance, in I, 70, 4, where the\nPada text reads:\n\nvardhan yam purvi\xc2\xb4 _h_ kshapa _h_ vi-rupa _h_ sthatu _h_ _k_ a ratham _ri_ ta-\npravitam.\n\nAll scholars who have touched on this verse, Professors Benfey, Bollensen,\nRoth, and others, have pointed out that\n\np. lxxiii\n\ninstead of _k_ a ratham, the original poet must have said _k_ aratham. The\nphrase sthatu _h_ _k_ aratham, what stands and moves, occurs several times. It\nis evidently an ancient phrase, and hence we can account for the preservation\nin it of the old termination of the nom. sing. of neuters in _ri_ , which\nhere, as in the Greek \xce\xbc\xce\xac\xcf\x81-\xcf\x84\xcf\x85\xcf\x81 or \xce\xbc\xce\xac\xcf\x81-\xcf\x84\xcf\x85\xcf\x82, masc., appears as ur or us, while in\nthe ordinary Sanskrit we find _ri_ only. This nom. sing. neut. in us, explains\nalso the common genitives and ablatives, pitu _h_ , matu _h_ , &c., which\nstand for pitur-s, matur-s. This phrase sthatu _h_ _k_ aratham occurs:\n\nI, 58, 5. sthatu _h_ _k_ aratham bhayate patatri _n_ a _h_.\n\nWhat stands and what moves is afraid of Agni.\n\nI, 68, 1. sthatu _h_ _k_ aratham aktu\xc2\xb4n vi ur _n_ ot.\n\nHe lighted up what stands and what moves during every night.\n\nI, 72, 6. pa _s_ u\xc2\xb4n ka sthat _r i\xc2\xb4_n _k_ aratham _k_ a pahi.\n\nProtect the cattle, and what stands and moves!\n\nHere it has been proposed to read sthatu _h_ instead of sthat _r i\xc2\xb4_n, and I\nconfess that this emendation is very plausible. One does not see how pa _s_ u,\ncattle, could be called immobilia or fixtures, unless the poet wished to make\na distinction between cattle that are kept fastened in stables, and cattle\nthat are allowed to roam about freely in the homestead. This distinction is\nalluded to, for instance, in the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a, XI, 8, 3, 2.\nsaurya evaisha pa _s_ u _h_ syad iti, tasmad etasminn astamite pa _s_ avo\nbadhyante; badhnanty ekan yathagosh _th_ am, eka upasamayanti.\n\nI, 70, 2. garbha _h_ _k_ a sthata\xc2\xb4m garbha _h_ _k_ aratham, (read sthatra\xc2\xb4m,\nand see Bollensen, Orient and Occident, vol. ii, p. 462.)\n\nHe who is within all that stands and all that moves.\n\nThe word _k_ aratha, if it occurs by itself, means flock, movable property:\n\nIII, 31, 15. a\xc2\xb4t it sakhi-bhya _h_ _k_ aratham sam airat.\n\nHe brought together, for his friends, the flocks.\n\nVIII, 33, 8. puru-tra\xc2\xb4 _k_ aratham dadhe.\n\nHe bestowed flocks on many people.\n\nX, 92, 13. pra na _h_ pusha\xc2\xb4 _k_ aratham--avatu.\n\nMay Pushan protect our flock!\n\np. lxxiv\n\nAnother idiomatic phrase in which sthatu _h_ occurs is sthatu _h_ _g_ agata\n_h_ , and here sthatu _h_ is really a genitive:\n\nIV, 53, 6. _g_ agata _h_ sthatu _h_ k ubhayasya ya _h_ va _s_ i\xc2\xb4.\n\nHe who is lord of both, of what is movable and what is immovable.\n\nVI, 50, 7. vi _s_ vasya sthatu _h_ _g_ agata _h_ _g_ anitri _h_.\n\nThey who created all that stands and moves.\n\nVII, 60, 2. vi _s_ vasya sthatu _h_ _g_ agata _h_ _k_ a gopa\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nThe guardians of all that stands and moves. Cf. X, 63, 8.\n\nI, 159, 3. sthatu _h_ _k_ a satyam _g_ agata _h_ _k_ a dharma _n_ i putrasya\npatha _h_ padam advayavina _h_.\n\nTruly while you uphold all that stands and moves, you protect the home of the\nguileless son. Cf. II, 31, 5.\n\nBut although I have no doubt that in I, 70, 4, the original poet said sthatu\n_h_ _k_ aratham, I should be loath to suppress the evidence of the mistake and\nalter the Pada text from _k_ a ratham to _k_ aratham. The very mistake is\ninstructive, as showing us the kind of misapprehension to which the collectors\nof the Vedic text were liable, and enabling us to judge how far the limits of\nconjectural criticism may safely be extended.\n\nA still more extraordinary case of misunderstanding on the part of the\noriginal compilers of the Vedic texts, Uloka.and likewise of the authors of\nthe Prati _s_ akhyas, the Niruktas, and other Vedic treatises, has been\npointed out by Professor Kuhn. In an article of his, 'Zur altesten Geschichte\nder Indogermanischen Volker' (Indische Studien, vol. i, p. 351), he made the\nfollowing observation: 'The Lithuanian laukas, Lett. lauks, Pruss. laukas, all\nmeaning field, agree exactly with the Sk. lokas, world, Lat. locus, Low Germ.\n(in East-Frisia and Oldenburg) louch, loch, village. All these words are to be\ntraced back to the Sk. uru, Gr. \xce\xb5\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x82, broad, wide. The initial u is lost, as\nin Goth. rums, O. H. G. rumi, rumin (Low Germ. rume, an open uncultivated\nfield in a forest), and the r changed into l. In support of this derivation it\nshould be observed that in the Veda loka is frequently preceded by the\nparticle u, which probably was only separated from it by the Diaskeuastae, and\nthat the meaning is\n\np. lxxv\n\nthat of open space.' Although this derivation has met with little favour, I\nconfess that I look upon this remark, excepting only the Latin locus a, i. e.\nstlocus, as one of the most ingenious of this eminent scholar. The fact is\nthat this particle u before loka is one of the most puzzling occurrences in\nthe Veda. Professor Bollensen says that loka never occurs without a preceding\nu in the first eight Ma _n_ _d_ alas, and this is perfectly true with the\nexception of one passage which he has overlooked, VIII, 100, 12, dyau _h_ dehi\nlokam va _g_ raya vi-skabhe, Dyu! give room for the lightning to step forth!\nProfessor Bollensen (l. c. p. 603) reads v _ri_ tra\xc2\xb4ya instead of va _g_ raya,\nwithout authority. He objects to dyau _h_ as a vocative, which should be dyau\xc2\xb4\n_h_ ; but dyau _h_ may be dyo _h_ , a genitive belonging to va _g_ raya, in\nwhich case we should translate, Make room for the lightning of Dyu to step\nforth!\n\nBut what is even more important is the fact that the occurrence of this\nunaccented u at the beginning of a pada is against the very rules, or, at\nleast, runs counter to the very observations which the authors of the Prati\n_s_ akhya have made on the inadmissibility of an unaccented word in such a\nplace, so that they had to insert a special provision, Prat. 978, exempting\nthe unaccented u from this observation: anudattam tu padadau novar _g_ am\nvidyate padam, 'no unaccented word is found at the beginning of a pada except\nu!' Although I have frequently insisted on the fact that such statements of\nthe Prati _s_ akhya are not to be considered as rules, but simply as more or\nless general statistical accumulations of facts actually occurring in the\nVeda, I have also pointed out that we are at liberty to found on these\ncollected facts inductive observations which may assume the character of real\nrules. Thus, in our case, we can well understand why there should be none, or,\nat least, very few instances, where an unaccented word begins a pada. We\nshould not begin a verse with an enclitic particle in any other language\neither; and as in Sanskrit a verb at the\n\np. lxxvi\n\nbeginning of a pada receives ipso facto the accent, and as the same applies to\nvocatives, no chance is left for an unaccented word in that place, except it\nbe a particle. But the one particle that offends against this general\nobservation is u, and the very word before which this u causes this metrical\noffence, is loka. Can any argument be more tempting in favour of admitting an\nold form uloka instead of u loka? Lokam is preceded by u in I, 93, 6; II, 30,\n6; (asmin bhaya-sthe k _ri_ _n_ utam u lokam, make room for us, grant an\nescape to us, in this danger!) IV, 17, 17; VI, 23, 3; 7 (with urum); 47, 8\n(urum na _h_ lokam, or ulokam?); 73, 2; VII, 20, 2; 33, 5 (with urum); 60, 9\n(with urum); 84, 2 (with urum); 99, 4 (with urum); IX, 92, 5; X, 13, 2; 16, 4\n(suk _r i_tam u lokam); 30, 7; 104, 10; 180, 3 (with urum). Loke is preceded\nby u in III, 29, 8; V, 1, 6; lokak _r i_t, IX, 86, 21; X, 133, 1. In all\nremaining passages u loka is found at the beginning of a pada: loka _h_ , III,\n37, 11; lokam, III, 2, 9 (u lokam u dve (iti) upa _g_ amim iyatu _h_ ); V, 4,\nII; loka-k _ri_ tnum, VIII, 15, 4; IX, 2, 8. The only passages in which loka\noccurs without being preceded by u, are lokam, VI, 47, 8 (see above); VIII,\n100, 12; X, 14, 9; 85, 20 (am _r i_tasya); loka\xc2\xb4 _h_ , IX, 113, 9; loka\xc2\xb4n, X,\n90, 14; loke, IX, 113, 72; X, 85, 24.\n\nIt should be remembered that in the Gathas the u of words beginning with urv\xc2\xb0\ndoes not count metrically (Hubschmann, Ein Zoroastrisches Lied, p. 37), and\nthat in Pali also uru must be treated as monosyllabic, in such passages as\nMahav., p. 2, line 5. The same applies to passages in the Rig-veda, such as I,\n138, 3; VII, 39, 3, where the metre requires uru to be treated as one\nsyllable. In IX, 96, 15, the original reading may have been urur iva, instead\nof uru-iva.\n\nConsidering all this, I feel as convinced as it is possible to be in such\nmatters, that in all the passages where u loka occurs and where it means\nspace, carriere ouverte, freedom, we ought to read uloka; but in spite of this\nI could never bring myself to insert this word, of which neither the authors\nof the Brahma _n_ as nor the writers of the Prati _s_ akhyas or even later\ngrammarians had any idea, into the text. On\n\np. lxxvii\n\nthe contrary, I should here, too, consider it most useful to leave the\ntraditional reading, and to add the corrections in the margin, in order that,\nif these conjectural emendations are in time considered as beyond the reach of\ndoubt, they may be used as evidence in support of conjectures which, without\nsuch evidence, might seem intolerable in the eyes of timid critics.\n\nThere remains one difficulty about this hypothetical word uloka, which it is\nbut fair to mention. If it is derived from uru, or, as Professor Bollensen\nsuggests, from urva _k_ or urvak, the change of va into o would require\nfurther support. Neither maghon for maghavan, nor duro _n_ a for dura-va _n_ a\nare strictly analogous cases, because in each we have an a preceding the va or\nu. Strictly speaking, uroka presupposes uravaka, as _s_ loka presupposes _s_\nravaka, or oka, house, avaka (from av, not from u _k_ ). It should also be\nmentioned that a compound such as RV. X, 128, 2, urulokam (scil. antariksham)\nis strange, and shows how completely the origin of loka was forgotten at the\ntime when the hymns of the tenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala were composed. But all this\ndoes not persuade us to accept Ascoli's conjecture (Lezioni di Fonologia\nComparata, p. 235), that as uloga (but not uloka) is a regular Tamil form of\nloka, uloka in the Veda might be due to a reaction of the aboriginal dialects\non the Vedic Sanskrit. We want far more evidence before admitting such a\nreaction during the Vedic period.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxxi:a](sbe3209.htm#fr_44) Professor Aufrecht in his new edition of the text\n(1877) adopts the more timid reading p _ri_ _s_ naya _h_.
