He could write verse as well as prose in\ndead languages, not very correctly, but still, better than all his fellows--\nwhich constituted him a distinguished writer. He had history, theosophy, and\nthe four Vedas of Scriptures at his fingers\' ends, he was skilled in the\nargute science of Nyasa or Disputation, his mind was a mine of Pauranic or\ncosmogonico-traditional lore, handed down from the ancient fathers to the\nmodern fathers: and he had written bulky commentaries, exhausting all that\ntongue of man has to say, upon the obscure text of some old philosopher whose\nworks upon ethics, poetry, and rhetoric were supposed by the sages of Gaur to\ncontain the germs of everything knowable. His fame went over all the country;\nyea, from country to country. He was a sea of excellent qualities, the father\nand mother of Brahmans, cows, and women, and the horror of loose persons, cut-\nthroats, courtiers, and courtesans. As a benefactor he was equal to Karna,\nmost liberal of heroes. In regard to truth he was equal to the veracious king\nYudhishtira.\n\nTrue, he was sometimes at a loss to spell a common word in his mother tongue,\nand whilst he knew to a fingerbreadth how many palms and paces the sun, the\nmoon, and all the stars are distant from the earth, he would have been puzzled\nto tell you where the region called Yavana[119] lies. Whilst he could\nenumerate, in strict chronological succession, every important event that\nhappened five or six million years before he was born, he was profoundly\nignorant of those that occurred in his own day. And once he asked a friend\nseriously, if a cat let loose in the jungle would not in time become a tiger.\n\nYet did all the members of alma mater Kasi, Pandits[120] as well as students,\nlook with awe upon Vishnu Swami\'s livid cheeks, and lack-lustre eyes, grimed\nhands and soiled cottons.\n\nNow it so happened that this wise and pious Brahmanic peer had four sons, whom\nhe brought up in the strictest and most serious way. They were taught to\nrepeat their prayers long before they understood a word of them, and when they\nreached the age of four[121] they had read a variety of hymns and spiritual\nsongs. Then they were set to learn by heart precepts that inculcate sacred\nduties, and arguments relating to theology, abstract and concrete.\n\nTheir father, who was also their tutor, sedulously cultivated, as all the best\nworks upon education advise, their implicit obedience, humble respect, warm\nattachment, and the virtues and sentiments generally. He praised them secretly\nand reprehended them openly, to exercise their humility. He derided their\nlooks, and dressed them coarsely, to preserve them from vanity and conceit.\nWhenever they anticipated a "treat," he punctually disappointed them, to teach\nthem self-denial. Often when he had promised them a present, he would revoke,\nnot break his word, in order that discipline might have a name and habitat in\nhis household. And knowing by experience how much stronger than love is fear,\nhe frequently threatened, browbeat, and overawed them with the rod and the\ntongue, with the terrors of this world, and with the horrors of the next, that\nthey might be kept in the right way by dread of falling into the bottomless\npits that bound it on both sides.\n\nAt the age of six they were transferred to the Chatushpati[122] or school.\nEvery morning the teacher and his pupils assembled in the hut where the\ndifferent classes were called up by turns. They laboured till noon, and were\nallowed only two hours, a moiety of the usual time, for bathing, eating,\nsleep, and worship, which took up half the period. At 3 P.M. they resumed\ntheir labours, repeating to the tutor what they had learned by heart, and\nlistening to the meaning of it: this lasted till twilight. They then\nworshipped, ate and drank for an hour: after which came a return of study,\nrepeating the day\'s lessons, till 10 P.M.\n\nIn their rare days of ease--for the learned priest, mindful of the words of\nthe wise, did not wish to dull them by everlasting work--they were enjoined to\ndisport themselves with the gravity and the decorum that befit young\nSamditats, not to engage in night frolics, not to use free jests or light\nexpressions, not to draw pictures on the walls, not to eat honey, flesh, and\nsweet substances turned acid, not to talk to little girls at the well-side, on\nno account to wear sandals, carry an umbrella, or handle a die even for love,\nand by no means to steal their neighbours\' mangoes.\n\nAs they advanced in years their attention during work time was unremittingly\ndirected to the Vedas. Wordly studies were almost excluded, or to speak more\ncorrectly, whenever wordly studies were brought upon the carpet, they were so\nevil entreated, that they well nigh lost all form and feature. History became\n"The Annals of India on Brahminical Principles," opposed to the Buddhistical;\ngeography "The Lands of the Vedas," none other being deemed worthy of notice;\nand law, "The Institutes of Manu," then almost obsolete, despite their\nexceeding sanctity.\n\nBut Jatu-harini[123] had evidently changed these children before they were\nborn; and Shani[124] must have been in the ninth mansion when they came to\nlight.\n\nEach youth as he attained the mature age of twelve was formally entered at the\nUniversity of Kasi, where, without loss of time, the first became a gambler,\nthe second a confirmed libertine, the third a thief, and the fourth a high\nBuddhist, or in other words an utter atheist.\n\nHere King Vikram frowned at his son, a hint that he had better not behave\nhimself as the children of highly moral and religious parents usually do. The\nyoung prince understood him, and briefly remarking that such things were\ncommon in distinguished Brahman families, asked the Baital what he meant by\nthe word "Atheist."\n\nOf a truth (answered the Vampire) it is most difficult to explain. The sages\nassign to it three or four several meanings: first, one who denies that the\ngods exist secondly, one who owns that the gods exist but denies that they\nbusy themselves with human affairs; and thirdly, one who believes in the gods\nand in their providence, but also believes that they are easily to be set\naside. Similarly some atheists derive all things from dead and unintelligent\nmatter; others from matter living and energetic but without sense or will:\nothers from matter with forms and qualities generable and conceptible; and\nothers from a plastic and methodical nature. Thus the Vishnu Swamis of the\nworld have invested the subject with some confusion. The simple, that is to\nsay, the mass of mortality, have confounded that confusion by reproachfully\napplying the word atheist to those whose opinions differ materially from their\nown.\n\nBut I being at present, perhaps happily for myself, a Vampire, and having,\njust now, none of these human or inhuman ideas, meant simply to say that the\npious priest\'s fourth son being great at second and small in the matter of\nfirst causes, adopted to their fullest extent the doctrines of the\nphilosophical Buddhas.[125] Nothing according to him exists but the five\nelements, earth, water, fire, air (or wind), and vacuum, and from the last\nproceeded the penultimate, and so forth. With the sage Patanjali, he held the\nuniverse to have the power of perpetual progression.[126] He called that Matra\n(matter), which is an eternal and infinite principle, beginningless and\nendless. Organization, intelligence, and design, he opined, are inherent in\nmatter as growth is in a tree. He did not believe in soul or spirit, because\nit could not be detected in the body, and because it was a departure from\nphysiological analogy. The idea "I am," according to him, was not the\nidentification of spirit with matter, but a product of the mutation of matter\nin this cloud-like, error-formed world. He believed in Substance (Sat) and\nscoffed at Unsubstance (Asat). He asserted the subtlety and globularity of\natoms which are uncreate. He made mind and intellect a mere secretion of the\nbrain, or rather words expressing not a thing, but a state of things. Reason\nwas to him developed instinct, and life an element of the atmosphere affecting\ncertain organisms. He held good and evil to be merely geographical and\nchronological expressions, and he opined that what is called Evil is mostly an\nactive and transitive form of Good. Law was his great Creator of all things,\nbut he refused a creator of law, because such a creator would require another\ncreator, and so on in a quasi-interminable series up to absurdity. This\nreduced his law to a manner of haphazard. To those who, arguing against it,\nasked him their favourite question, How often might a man after he had jumbled\na set of letters in a bag fling them out upon the ground before they would\nfall into an exact poem? he replied that the calculation was beyond his\narithmetic, but that the man had only to jumble and fling long enough\ninevitably to arrive at that end. He rejected the necessity as well as the\nexistence of revelation, and he did not credit the miracles of Krishna,\nbecause, according to him, nature never suspends her laws, and, moreover, he\nhad never seen aught supernatural. He ridiculed the idea of Mahapralaya, or\nthe great destruction, for as the world had no beginning, so it will have no\nend. He objected to absorption, facetiously observing with the sage Jamadagni,\nthat it was pleasant to eat sweetmeats, but that for his part he did not wish\nto become the sweetmeat itself. He would not believe that Vishnu had formed\nthe universe out of the wax in his ears. He positively asserted that trees are\nnot bodies in which the consequences of merit and demerit are received. Nor\nwould he conclude that to men were attached rewards and punishments from all\neternity. He made light of the Sanskara, or sacrament. He admitted Satwa,\nRaja, and Tama,[127] but only as properties of matter. He acknowledged gross\nmatter (Sthulasharir), and atomic matter (Shukshma-sharir), but not Linga-\nsharir, or the archetype of bodies. To doubt all things was the foundation of\nhis theory, and to scoff at all who would not doubt was the corner-stone of\nhis practice. In debate he preferred logical and mathematical grounds,\nrequiring a categorical "because" in answer to his "why?" He was full of\nmorality and natural religion, which some say is no religion at all. He gained\nthe name of atheist by declaring with Gotama that there are innumerable\nworlds, that the earth has nothing beneath it but the circumambient air, and\nthat the core of the globe is incandescent. And he was called a practical\natheist--a worse form apparently--for supporting the following dogma: "that\nthough creation may attest that a creator has been, it supplies no evidence to\nprove that a creator still exists." On which occasion, Shiromani, a nonplussed\ntheologian, asked him, "By whom and for what purpose west thou sent on earth?"\nThe youth scoffed at the word "sent," and replied, "Not being thy Supreme\nIntelligence, or Infinite Nihility, I am unable to explain the phenomenon."\nUpon which he quoted--\n\nHow sunk in darkness Gaur must be Whose guide is blind Shiromani!\n\nAt length it so happened that the four young men, having frequently been\nsurprised in flagrant delict, were summoned to the dread presence of the\nuniversity Gurus,[128] who addressed them as follows:--\n\n"There are four different characters in the world: he who perfectly obeys the\ncommands; he who practices the commands, but follows evil; he who does neither\ngood nor evil; and he who does nothing but evil. The third character, it is\nobserved, is also an offender, for he neglects that which he ought to observe.\nBut ye all belong to the fourth category." Then turning to the elder they\nsaid:\n\n"In works written upon the subject of government it is advised, \'Cut off the\ngambler\'s nose and ears, hold up his name to public contempt, and drive him\nout of the country, that he may thus become an example to others. For they who\nplay must more often lose than win; and losing, they must either pay or not\npay. In the latter case they forfeit caste, in the former they utterly reduce\nthemselves. And though a gambler\'s wife and children are in the house, do not\nconsider them to be so, since it is not known when they will be lost.[129]\nThus he is left in a state of perfect not-twoness (solitude), and he will be\nreborn in hell.\' O young man! thou hast set a bad example to others, therefore\nshalt thou immediately exchange this university for a country life."\n\nThen they spoke to the second offender thus :---\n\n"The wise shun woman, who can fascinate a man in the twinkling of an eye; but\nthe foolish, conceiving an affection for her, forfeit in the pursuit of\npleasure their truthfulness, reputation, and good disposition, their way of\nlife and mode of thought, their vows and their religion. And to such the\nadvice of their spiritual teachers comes amiss, whilst they make others as bad\nas themselves. For it is said, \'He who has lost all sense of shame, fears not\nto disgrace another; \'and there is the proverb, \'A wild cat that devours its\nown young is not likely to let a rat escape; \' therefore must thou too, O\nyoung man! quit this seat of learning with all possible expedition."\n\nThe young man proceeded to justify himself by quotations from the Lila-\nshastra, his text-book, by citing such 1ines as--\n\nFortune favours folly and force,\n\nand by advising the elderly professors to improve their skill in the peace and\nwar of love. But they drove him out with execrations.\n\nAs sagely and as solemnly did the Pandits and the Gurus reprove the thief and\nthe atheist, but they did not dispense the words of wisdom in equal\nproportions. They warned the former that petty larceny is punishable with\nfine, theft on a larger scale with mutilation of the hand, and robbery, when\ndetected in the act, with loss of life[130]; that for cutting purses, or for\nsnatching them out of a man\'s waistcloth,[131] \'the first penalty is chopping\noff the fingers, the second is the loss of the hand, and the third is death.\nThen they call him a dishonour to the college, and they said, "Thou art as a\nwoman, the greatest of plunderers; other robbers purloin property which is\nworthless, thou stealest the best; they plunder in the night, thou in the\nday," and so forth. They told him that he was a fellow who had read his\nChauriya Vidya to more purpose then his ritual.[132] And they drove him from\nthe door as he in his shamelessness began to quote texts about the four\napproved ways of housebreaking, namely, picking out burnt bricks, cutting\nthrough unbaked bricks, throwing water on a mud wall, and boring one of wood\nwith a centre-bit.\n\nBut they spent six mortal hours in convicting the atheist, whose abominations\nthey refuted by every possible argumentation: by inference, by comparison, and\nby sounds, by Sruti and Smriti, i.e., revelational and traditional, rational\nand evidential, physical and metaphysical, analytical and synthetical,\nphilosophical and philological, historical, and so forth. But they found all\ntheir endeavours vain. "For," it is said, "a man who has lost all shame, who\ncan talk without sense, and who tries to cheat his opponent, will never get\ntired, and will never be put down." He declared that a non-ad was far more\nprobable than a monad (the active principle), or the duad (the passive\nprinciple or matter.) He compared their faith with a bubble in the water, of\nwhich we can never predicate that it does exist or it does not. It is, he\nsaid, unreal, as when the thirsty mistakes the meadow mist for a pool of\nwater. He proved the eternity of sound.[133] He impudently recounted and\njustified all the villanies of the Vamachari or left-handed sects. He told\nthem that they had taken up an ass\'s load of religion, and had better apply to\nhonest industry. He fell foul of the gods; accused Yama of kicking his own\nmother, Indra of tempting the wife of his spiritual guide, and Shiva of\nassociating with low women. Thus, he said, no one can respect them. Do not we\nsay when it thunders awfully, "the rascally gods are dying!" And when it is\ntoo wet, "these villain gods are sending too much rain"? Briefly, the young\nBrahman replied to and harangued them all so impertinently, if not\npertinently, that they, waxing angry, fell upon him with their staves, and\ndrove him out of assembly.\n\nThen the four thriftless youths returned home to their father, who in his just\nindignation had urged their disgrace upon the Pandits and Gurus, otherwise\nthese dignitaries would never have resorted to such extreme measures with so\ndistinguished a house. He took the opportunity of turning them out upon the\nworld, until such time as they might be able to show substantial signs of\nreform. "For," he said, "those who have read science in their boyhood, and who\nin youth, agitated by evil passions, have remained in the insolence of\nignorance, feel regret in their old age, and are consumed by the fire of\navarice." In order to supply them with a motive for the task proposed, he\nstopped their monthly allowance But he added, if they would repair to the\nneighbouring university of Jayasthal, and there show themselves something\nbetter than a disgrace to their family, he would direct their maternal uncle\nto supply them with all the necessaries of food and raiment.\n\nIn vain the youths attempted, with sighs and tears and threats of suicide, to\nsoften the paternal heart. He was inexorable, for two reasons. In the first\nplace, after wondering away the wonder with which he regarded his own failure,\nhe felt that a stigma now attached to the name of the pious and learned Vishnu\nSwami, whose lectures upon "Management during Teens," and whose "Brahman Young\nMan\'s Own Book,\'\' had become standard works. Secondly, from a sense of duty,\nhe determined to omit nothing that might tend to reclaim the reprobates. As\nregards the monthly allowance being stopped, the reverend man had become every\nyear a little fonder of his purse; he had hoped that his sons would have\nqualified themselves to take pupils, and thus achieve for themselves, as he\nphrased it, "A genteel independence"; whilst they openly derided the career,\ncalling it "an admirable provision for the more indigent members of the middle\nclasses." For which reason he referred them to their maternal uncle, a man of\nknown and remarkable penuriousness.\n\nThe four ne\'er-do-weals, foreseeing what awaited them at Jayasthal, deferred\nit as a last resource; determining first to see a little life, and to push\ntheir way in the world, before condemning themselves to the tribulations of\nreform.\n\nThey tried to live without a monthly allowance, and notably they failed; it\nwas squeezing, as men say, oil from sand. The gambler, having no capital, and,\nworse still, no credit, lost two or three suvernas[134] at play, and could not\npay them; in consequence of which he was soundly beaten with iron-shod staves,\nand was nearly compelled by the keeper of the hell to sell himself into\nslavery. Thus he became disgusted; and telling his brethren that they would\nfind him at Jayasthal, he departed, with the intention of studying wisdom.\n\nA month afterwards came the libertine\'s turn to be disappointed. He could no\nlonger afford fine new clothes; even a well-washed coat was beyond his means.\nHe had reckoned upon his handsome face, and he had matured a plan for laying\nvarious elderly conquests under contribution. Judge, therefore, his disgust\nwhen all the women--high and low, rich and poor, old and young, ugly and\nbeautiful--seeing the end of his waistcloth thrown empty over his shoulder,\npassed him in the streets without even deigning a look. The very shopkeepers\'\nwives, who once had adored his mustachio and had never ceased talking of his\n"elegant" gait, despised him; and the wealthy old person who formerly supplied\nhis small feet with the choicest slippers, left him to starve. Upon which he\nalso in a state of repentance, followed his brother to acquire knowledge.\n\n"Am I not," quoth the thief to himself, "a cat in climbing, a deer in running,\na snake in twisting, a hawk in pouncing, a dog in scenting?--keen as a hare,\ntenacious as a wolf, strong as a lion?--a lamp in the night, a horse on a\nplain, a mule on a stony path, a boat in the water, a rock on land[135]?" The\nreply to his own questions was of course affirmative. But despite all these\nfine qualities, and notwithstanding his scrupulous strictness in invocating\nthe house-breaking tool and in devoting a due portion of his gains to the gods\nof plunder,[136] he was caught in a store-room by the proprietor, who\ninexorably handed him over to justice. As he belonged to the priestly\ncaste,[137] the fine imposed upon him was heavy. He could not pay it, and\ntherefore he was thrown into a dungeon, where he remained for some time. But\nat last he escaped from jail, when he made his parting bow to Kartikeya,[138]\nstole a blanket from one of the guards, and set out for Jayasthal, cursing his\nold profession.\n\nThe atheist also found himself in a position that deprived him of all his\npleasures. He delighted in afterdinner controversies, and in bringing the\nlight troops of his wit to bear upon the unwieldy masses of lore and logic\nopposed to him by polemical Brahmans who, out of respect for his father, did\nnot lay an action against him for overpowering them in theological\ndisputation.[139] In the strange city to which he had removed no one knew the\nson of Vishnu Swami, and no one cared to invite him to the house. Once he\nattempted his usual trick upon a knot of sages who, sitting round a tank, were\nrecreating themselves with quoting mystical Sanskrit shlokas[140] of\nabominable long-windedness. The result was his being obliged to ply his heels\nvigorously in flight from the justly incensed literati, to whom he had said\n"tush" and "pish," at least a dozen times in as many minutes. He therefore\nalso followed the example of his brethren, and started for Jayasthal with all\npossible expedition.\n\nArrived at the house of their maternal uncle, the young men, as by one assent,\nbegan to attempt the unloosening of his purse-strings. Signally failing in\nthis and in other notable schemes, they determined to lay in that stock of\nfacts and useful knowledge which might reconcile them with their father, and\nrestore them to that happy life at Gaur which they then despised, and which\nnow brought tears into their eyes.\n\nThen they debated with one another what they should study\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nThat branch of the preternatural, popularly called "white magic," found with\nthem favour.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nThey chose a Guru or teacher strictly according to the orders of their faith,\na wise man of honourable family and affable demeanour, who was not a glutton\nnor leprous, nor blind of one eye, nor blind of both eyes, nor very short, nor\nsuffering from whitlows,[141] asthma, or other disease, nor noisy and\ntalkative, nor with any defect about the fingers and toes, nor subject to his\nwife.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nA grand discovery had been lately made by a certain physiologico-philosophico-\npsychologico-materialist, a Jayasthalian. In investigating the vestiges of\ncreation, the cause of causes, the effect of effects, and the original origin\nof that Matra (matter) which some regard as an entity, others as a non-entity,\nothers self-existent, others merely specious and therefore unexistent, he\nbecame convinced that the fundamental form of organic being is a globule\nhaving another globule within itsel\xc2\x9c After inhabiting a garret and diving into\nthe depths of his self- consciousness for a few score years, he was able to\nproduce such complex globule in triturated and roasted flint by means of--I\nwill not say what. Happily for creation in general, the discovery died a\nnatural death some centuries ago. An edifying spectacle, indeed, for the world\nto see; a cross old man sitting amongst his gallipots and crucibles, creating\nanimalculae, providing the corpses of birds, beasts, and fishes with what is\nvulgarly called life, and supplying to epigenesis all the latest improvements!\n\nIn those days the invention, being a novelty, engrossed the thoughts of the\nuniversal learned, who were in a fever of excitement about it. Some believed\nin it so implicity that they saw in every experiment a hundred things which\nthey did not see. Others were so sceptical and contradictory that they would\nnot preceive what they did see. Those blended with each fact their own\ndeductions, whilst these span round every reality the web of their own\nprejudices. Curious to say, the Jayasthalians, amongst whom the luminous\nscience arose, hailed it with delight, whilst the Gaurians derided its claim\nto be considered an important addition to human knowledge.\n\nLet me try to remember a few of their words.\n\n"Unfortunate human nature," wrote the wise of Gaur against the wise of\nJayasthal, "wanted no crowning indignity but this! You had already proved that\nthe body is made of the basest element--earth. You had argued away the\nimmovability, the ubiquity, the permanency, the eternity, and the divinity of\nthe soul, for is not your favourite axiom, \' It is the nature of limbs which\nthinketh in man\'? The immortal mind is, according to you, an ignoble viscus;\nthe god-like gift of reason is the instinct of a dog somewhat highly\ndeveloped. Still you left us something to hope. Still you allowed us one\nboast. Still life was a thread connecting us with the Giver of Life. But now,\nwith an impious hand, in blasphemous rage ye have rent asunder that last frail\ntie." And so forth.\n\n"Welcome! thrice welcome! this latest and most admirable development of human\nwisdom," wrote the sage Jayasthalians against the sage Gaurians, "which has\nassigned to man his proper state and status and station in the magnificent\nscale of being. We have not created the facts which we have investigated, and\nwhich we now proudly publish. We have proved materialism to be nature\'s own\nsystem. But our philosophy of matter cannot overturn any truth, because, if\nerroneous, it will necessarily sink into oblivion; if real, it will tend only\nto instruct and to enlighten the world. Wise are ye in your generation, O ye\nsages of Gaur, yet withal wondrous illogical." And much of this kind.\n\nConcerning all which, mighty king! I, as a Vampire, have only to remark that\nthose two learned bodies, like your Rajaship\'s Nine Gems of Science, were in\nthe habit of talking most about what they least understood.\n\nThe four young men applied the whole force of their talents to mastering the\ndifficulties of the life-giving process; and in due time, their industry\nobtained its reward.\n\nThen they determined to return home. As with beating hearts they approached\nthe old city, their birthplace, and gazed with moistened eyes upon its tall\nspires and grim pagodas, its verdant meads and venerable groves, they saw a\nKanjar,[142] who, having tied up in a bundle the skin and bones of a tiger\nwhich he had found dead, was about to go on his way. Then said the thief to\nthe gambler, "Take we these remains with us, and by means of them prove the\ntruth of our science before the people of Gaur, to the offence of their\nnoses.[143]" Being now possessed of knowledge, they resolved to apply it to\nits proper purpose, namely, power over the property of others. Accordingly,\nthe wencher, the gambler, and the atheist kept the Kanjar in conversation\nwhilst the thief vivified a shank bone; and the bone thereupon stood upright,\nand hopped about in so grotesque and wonderful a way that the man, being\nfrightened, fled as if I had been close behind him.\n\nVishnu Swami had lately written a very learned commentary on the mystical\nwords of Lokakshi:\n\n"The Scriptures are at variance--the tradition is at variance. He who gives a\nmeaning of his own, quoting the Vedas, is no philosopher.\n\n"True philosophy, through ignorance, is concealed as in the fissures of a\nrock.\n\n"But the way of the Great One--that is to be followed."\n\nAnd the success of his book had quite effaced from the Brahman mind the holy\nman\'s failure in bringing up his children. He followed up this by adding to\nhis essay on education a twentieth tome, containing recipes for the\n"Reformation of Prodigals."\n\nThe learned and reverend father received his sons with open arms. He had heard\nfrom his brother-in-law that the youths were qualified to support themselves,\nand when informed that they wished to make a public experiment of their\nscience, he exerted himself, despite his disbelief in it, to forward their\nviews.\n\nThe Pandits and Gurus were long before they would consent to attend what they\nconsidered dealings with Yama (the Devil). In consequence, however, of Vishnu\nSwami\'s name and importunity, at length, on a certain day, all the pious,\nlearned, and reverend tutors, teachers, professors, prolocutors, pastors,\nspiritual fathers, poets, philosophers, mathematicians, schoolmasters,\npedagogues, bear-leaders, institutors, gerund-grinders, preceptors, dominies,\nbrushers, coryphaei, dry-nurses, coaches, mentors, monitors, lecturers,\nprelectors, fellows, and heads of houses at the university at Gaur, met\ntogether in a large garden, where they usually diverted themselves out of\nhours with ball-tossing, pigeon-tumbling, and kite-flying.\n\nPresently the four young men, carrying their bundle of bones and the other\nrequisites, stepped forward, walking slowly with eyes downcast, like shrinking\ncattle: for it is said, the Brahman must not run, even when it rains.\n\nAfter pronouncing an impromptu speech, composed for them by their father, and\nso stuffed with erudition that even the writer hardly understood it, they\nannounced their wish to prove, by ocular demonstration, the truth of a science\nupon which their short-sighted rivals of Jayasthal had cast cold water, but\nwhich, they remarked in the eloquent peroration of their discourse, the sages\nof Gaur had welcomed with that wise and catholic spirit of inquiry which had\never characterized their distinguished body.\n\nHuge words, involved sentences, and the high-flown compliment, exceedingly\nundeserved, obscured, I suppose, the bright wits of the intellectual\nconvocation, which really began to think that their liberality of opinion\ndeserved all praise.\n\nNone objected to what was being prepared, except one of the heads of houses;\nhis appeal was generally scouted, because his Sanskrit style was vulgarly\nintelligible, and he had the bad name of being a practical man. The\nmetaphysician Rashik Lall sneered to Vaiswata the poet, who passed on the look\nto the theo-philosopher Vardhaman. Haridatt the antiquarian whispered the\nmetaphysician Vasudeva, who burst into a loud laugh; whilst Narayan,\nJagasharma, and Devaswami, all very learned in the Vedas, opened their eyes\nand stared at him with well-simulated astonishment. So he, being offended,\nsaid nothing more, but arose and walked home.\n\nA great crowd gathered round the four young men and their father, as opening\nthe bundle that contained the tiger\'s remains, they prepared for their task.\n\nOne of the operators spread the bones upon the ground and fixed each one into\nits proper socket, not forgetting even the teeth and tusks.\n\nThe second connected, by means of a marvellous unguent, the skeleton with the\nmuscles and heart of an elephant, which he had procured for the purpose.\n\nThe third drew from his pouch the brain and eyes of a large tom-cat, which he\ncarefully fitted into the animal\'s skull, and then covered the body with the\nhide of a young rhinoceros.\n\nThen the fourth--the atheist--who had been directing the operation, produced a\nglobule having another globule within itself. And as the crowd pressed on\nthem, craning their necks, breathless with anxiety, he placed the Principle of\nOrganic Life in the tiger\'s body with such effect that the monster immediately\nheaved its chest, breathed, agitated its limbs, opened its eyes, jumped to its\nfeet, shook itself, glared around, and began to gnash its teeth and lick its\nchops, lashing the while its ribs with its tail.\n\nThe sages sprang back, and the beast sprang forward. With a roar like thunder\nduring Elephanta-time,[144] it flew at the nearest of the spectators, flung\nVishnu Swami to the ground and clawed his four sons. Then, not even stopping\nto drink their blood, it hurried after the flying herd of wise men. Jostling\nand tumbling, stumbling and catching at one another\'s long robes, they rushed\nin hottest haste towards the garden gate. But the beast, having the muscles of\nan elephant as well as the bones of a tiger, made a few bounds of eighty or\nninety feet each, easily distanced them, and took away all chance of escape.\nTo be brief: as the monster was frightfully hungry after its long fast, and as\nthe imprudent young men had furnished it with admirable implements of\ndestruction, it did not cease its work till one hundred and twenty-one learned\nand highly distinguished Pandits and Gurus lay upon the ground chawed, clawed,\nsucked dry, and in most cases stone-dead. Amongst them, I need hardly say,\nwere the sage Vishnu Swami and his four sons.\n\nHaving told this story the Vampire hung silent for a time. Presently he\nresumed--\n\n"Now, heed my words, Raja Vikram! I am about to ask thee, Which of all those\nlearned men was the most finished fool? The answer is easily found, yet it\nmust be distasteful to thee. Therefore mortify thy vanity, as soon as\npossible, or I shall be talking, and thou wilt be walking through this\nlivelong night, to scanty purpose. Remember! science without understanding is\nof little use; indeed, understanding is superior to science, and those devoid\nof understanding perish as did the persons who revivified the tiger. Before\nthis, I warned thee to beware of thyself, and of shine own conceit. Here,\nthen, is an opportunity for self-discipline--which of all those learned men\nwas the greatest fool?"\n\nThe warrior king mistook the kind of mortification imposed upon him, and\npondered over the uncomfortable nature of the reply--in the presence of his\nson.\n\nAgain the Baital taunted him.\n\n"The greatest fool of all," at last said Vikram, in slow and by no means\nwilling accents, "was the father. Is it not said, \'There is no fool like an\nold fool\'?"\n\n"Gramercy!" cried the Vampire, bursting out into a discordant laugh, "I now\nreturn to my tree. By this head! I never before heard a father so readily\ncondemn a father." With these words he disappeared, slipping out of the\nbundle.\n\nThe Raja scolded his son a little for want of obedience, and said that he had\nalways thought more highly of his acuteness--never could have believed that he\nwould have been taken in by so shallow a trick. Dharma Dhwaj answered not a\nword to this, but promised to be wiser another time.\n\nThen they returned to the tree, and did what they had so often done before.\n\nAnd, as before, the Baital held his tongue for a time. Presently he began as\nfollows.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vampire\'s Eighth Story. Of the Use and Misuse of Magic\nPills.](vav12.htm)\n\n'
