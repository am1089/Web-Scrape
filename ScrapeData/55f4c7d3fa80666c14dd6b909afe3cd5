And it is painted on the\nsurface of planet Earth in nature\'s most vivid pigments of green and blue.\nGreen for the fields and forests, the palms and the gardens and the grain; and\nblue, blue, blue everywhere else, for the sky above and for the waters\nbeneath. To those who know Holland, or even Venice, this land is full of\nsubtle suggestions and reminiscences of distant beauty. For it, too, is a\ncountry snatched from the waters, though not by the hand of man. It, too, lies\npassive and half-expectant under the unbroken dome of heaven, In it, too, the\nwhite sail may suddenly come into vision at any moment across\n\np. 160\n\nthe distant meadows. And it, too, bestows that irresistible calmness of\nbenediction that comes to the infinitely small in the presence of the\ninfinitely great.\n\nThere are of course differences. This is a tropical Holland. The wide green\nflats are broken, not by stiff avenues of poplars and rows of wintry pollard\nelms, but by long irregular fringes of jungle, groups of cocoanut and betel-\nnut palms, clusters of delicate bamboos, outstanding leaf-almonds here and\nthere, with almost every branch of glossy verdure ending in a leaf like a\nscarlet flag, and lines of upright banana plants, hedging in the fruit and\nvegetable gardens of the homesteads. These last, too, are, as is natural,\nstrangely different from the prim farmhouses of the Dutch with their red\ntiles. From the river-front we see a large thatched roof, whose wide curving\neaves overhang a cottage built apparently of something like basket-work, but\nin fact of mats, woven out of bamboo-splinters. The rafters and posts of this\nsimple structure are also of bamboo, and it may be that a single roof covers,\nnot only the home, but also a small open barn, holding a couple of cows, while\nover the heads of these last is seen again a second storey with floor made of\nsplit bamboo, and filled with rice-straw, thus answering all the purposes of a\nhayloft. The floor of the cottage itself, in any case, is made\n\np. 161\n\nof clean silver river-clay, packed solid and tight and smooth. And a very good\ntest of the wealth of the family lies in the height of this modern plinth.\nWithin, the dwelling has in all probability a ground-floor, lifted a foot or\ntwo above this of mud, and made, like that of the hayloft, of split-bamboo;\nand on this, with whatever they may be able to command of comfort in the way\nof cushions, wadded sheets, and cotton carpets, the household live. The one\nlarge room is often partitioned into two or three smaller. Always there is an\nopen veranda outside which acts as the family reception-room. Almost always\nthere is some corner, either in but or ben, which is built off from the rest,\nand used as the cooking room. And in every house there are wooden and bamboo\nplatforms overhead, which can be used either as store-cupboards or extra\nsleeping rooms, according as the special occasion demands. The little\nfarmhouse, however, has no doorway of inferior dignity. Even when the front\nentrance is towards the river bank, it is nevertheless almost certain that the\nopen veranda will be found on the far side, facing, like a simple cloister,\nthe interior of the little farmyard, on the two or three other sides of which\nare placed similar, but probably still less imposing, dwellings. Here, too,\nare the outbuildings and offices of the farm, the husking-shed, the cow-house,\nthe dovecote, and\n\np. 162\n\nthe feeding-place for ducks, with close at hand the herb and fruit garden. And\nthe whole of this little group of reed-built chambers is enclosed and\nconnected with the next like it by the homestead grove of palms and jungle-\ngrowth. It has its own boat, too, made of long narrow planks of palm wood, in\nwhich seven or eight people can sit in single file, so long as one or two\nremain constantly busied, baling out the water with which it is as constantly\nfilling. And finally, this cluster of houses does not constitute a village. It\nmay take twenty or more of such, thrown like the links of a chain around and\nacross the rice fields, to make a single village-community. Hence, in this\nwonderful country, it is sometimes possible, sitting in the low boat of the\nwater-lanes, to say that the village includes more than the horizon.\n\nIn the riverside villages, again, the _Chashas_ , or peasants, and the\n_Majhis_ , boatmen or fisherfolk, dwell side by side. They are for the most\npart Mohammedans and only sometimes Hindus. But the two do not always live in\nseparate villages. Nor is there any great difference between them in point of\ncivilisation. A few hundreds of years ago all alike were Hindus, but to the\nlow castes, Islam, with its message of democracy and brotherly love, offers a\ngreat emancipation. And in East Bengal these must have been swept into the\nfold, whole villages at a time. The descendants of\n\np. 163\n\nsuch converts have the title "Sheikh" prefixed to their names, and here they\nare all Sheikhs. But even now they appear like Hindus. Their widows are loath\nto remarry. They wear the unbordered _sari_ and cut the hair short, like the\nHindu widow. They object to cow-killing, like the Hindus. Their children are\ntrained, not in the knowledge of the Koran alone, but also in the stories of\nthe old Indian epics. And finally, their homes are decorated with the same\nreligious pictures and images as those of the Hindu. In other words, it is one\nrace practising the forms of two different faiths, and even in India blood\nspeaks louder than creed.\n\nThey are a proud and self-respecting folk, these people of the villages of\nEast Bengal, decent and thrifty in all their ways, as conscious as ourselves\nof subtle differences of rank and education, and full of the spirit of\nindependence and self-reliance. It is not easy here to buy the trifle to which\none takes a fancy. Permission to do so may be asked with all possible\nformality and ceremony, but the answer is invariably the smiling surrender of\nthe object, as a gift. I have a little boatman\'s lamp of black earthenware,\nwhich came to me in this way. It is one of the loveliest things I ever saw,\nand its value in the village-markets is, I am told, one farthing. But though I\noffered sixteen times that sum, its owner would not hear of purchase,\n\np. 164\n\ninsisting instead on presenting it to me. Of a similar significance was my\nfirst encounter with the Barisal fisher-folk. In this land of canals, it is\ncustomary to use for conveyance a very fine and commodious Indian form of\nhouse-boat. The empty rooms, made of dark polished teak-wood, are scrupulously\nclean, and we bring our own rugs and pillows, and sit or lie on the floor for\nthe journey. Outside, under bamboo arches, covered with sliding hoods of reed\nmats, sit the boatmen. And a few fishing-nets, or a spindle with its thread,\nor a small clay stove at which cooking is going on, offer at once the only\ntraces of furniture, and the only elements of picturesque disorder, to be\nseen. The crew consists of the men of a single family, from the grey-haired\ngrandfather or grand-uncle to the youngest boy. The women have been left at\nhome in the distant village, to tend the cows, and spin, and look after the\ngardens. There is something of the dignity of Homer\'s peasant-kings in such a\nscheme of life and work; and I was a little diffident with the first boatmen I\nhad accosted, in making inquiries as to whether the prevailing famine and rise\nin prices had made themselves felt severely by them and theirs. Their first\neffort was to put me at my ease. Gravely and kindly they took up the question.\nWork, they said, had become scarce everywhere. No one who could possibly do\nwithout\n\np. 165\n\nit would employ labour at such a time. Everyone naturally was cutting his\nexpenses down. They themselves, for instance, had lain to, at the little quay\nwhere we found them, for ten days past, and this was the first day they had\nbeen employed. Inevitably, therefore, things were a little difficult. But they\nhad managed. Oh yes! they had managed. And they had no doubt that in some way\nor other they would contrive to go on, With this abrupt reserve, this lowering\nof the visor, so to speak, the subject was dropped, and could be pursued no\nfurther. Yet it was not that the newcomer had been rebuked for impertinence,\nbut rather that all alike we had realised the sudden pain of the attempt to\nlay bare our necessities to others.\n\nAnd everywhere in the famine-villages I found the same thing. Here and there\nas we went about, we would come upon someone whose store of money or\nprovisions was not yet wholly exhausted, someone who was still hoping that\npublic charity would prove unnecessary to his little household. And wherever\nthis happened the personal question would be skilfully evaded, and any\ndiscussion of the situation quietly refused. It is needless to say that the\nintense sensitiveness and delicacy of these Indian villagers played its own\npart in helping to deepen our understanding of the prevailing desolation.\nEvery story told meant so much pride overcome.\n\np. 166\n\nLike a great net made of cords of shining silver-blue, the water-ways--broad\nrivers, narrower canals or _khals_ , and narrowest of all the little water-\nlanes--hold lovingly in their clasp this beautiful land, which throughout the\nhistoric period has been known as the Granary of Bengal. But the villages have\na proverb, "With kings, with horned beasts, and with a river a man may never\nbe friends." Much as the heart may go out in love, that is to say, there will\nsurely come sooner or later, with such, a moment of treachery, when they will\ndeal out death to him whom they have caressed. Alas, that this should have\nproved true of our lovely rivers of East Bengal.\n\nAlready the villages had been many months in the grip of famine. For the chief\nIndian harvest of the year is reaped in January, and in this year of 1906 it\nwas terribly scant. The rains twelve months ago, at the time of sowing, were\ntoo little. Moreover, in some of the more ocean-exposed districts there were\nsalt floods, and the crops were ruined. Within a month or two of this year\'s\nreaping, therefore, the long slow agony of starvation must have set in amongst\nthe people. But it was borne in grim silence as long as possible, and only in\nthe middle of June did the terrible word Famine make itself heard. And yet, as\nif the cup of their sorrows were not even now full, it became clear, on the\nbreaking of the monsoon, that the\n\np. 167\n\nrains this year were to be excessive; and finally, in the middle of August,\nthe rivers, swollen by heavy rains and melting snows in the far north,\nsuddenly broke their bounds, and the fair lands of Eastern Bengal became a\nworld under water, the floods doubling the disaster created by the famine.\n\n#### I.--FAMINE AND FLOOD\n\nIt was dawn on the 8th of September; one of those dawns of pearl and opal that\ncome to us in the Indian autumn. The water-lilies lay open still, as they had\nlain all night long on the surface of the waters. Here we paddled up to a\ncluster, lying touching one another, as if with their heads on each other\'s\nshoulders, with golden hearts, and rose-tinged petals. And we counted them and\nfound them seven. Seven lilies open in the dawn! The air was cool but not\nchill, and full of quiet and fragrance. And all around us in every direction--\ninwards from the edge of the river-current behind us, to the distant line of\nfarmstead groves, and right and left, all the way from one dark jungle-border\nto another--stretched the smooth silver water, pierced by the upspringing\nspears of the young rice, which here and there was so scanty that each upright\nblade was companioned by its own reflection in the water-mirror underneath. A\nworld full of the joy of the senses--\n\np. 168\n\nnot a gross or physical delight, but the silent in-flooding of sense-rapture\non the spirit--for him whose body was fed and mind at rest.\n\nA world of sense-joy. Was that how it looked to the women yonder, standing up\nto their waists in water, to receive us, as we paddled and punted towards\ntheir dwelling-place? Much sense-joy feel these others, think we, who have\ntaken refuge with their children, from their fallen house, in the hayloft of a\nneighbour, and are living there, more like birds than human beings--who can\ntell us how many days? Nay, for these, and their like, there can be no joy of\nthe senses, for the present is to them a horror, and who knows what agony may\nawait them in the near future?\n\nOr it was noon, and in a distant part of the country, not very far in fact\nfrom the city, we waded in water above the knees, or shot in the palm-boat\nacross the rice-fields, finding our way from one farmhouse to another. And\nstill, in spite of the sorrow all about us, one could now and then only catch\none\'s breath, and feel how wondrous, to him who was born amongst them, must be\nthe brimful beauty of these rice-lands. Grey clouds, grey mists, grey waters,\nand drizzling rain, we seemed to be alone in a world-vastness, alone, alone.\nSuddenly a great wind would catch the jungle-belt about us, and all the\nmangoes and palms respond, moaning and wailing. Then again\n\np. 169\n\nit would pass, and silence come once more, upon the infinite monotony of our\nlevel world, with the first sense back, of a fulness of something that was\nneither life nor death, but on the mystic borderline between the two--perhaps\nincluding both.\n\nNever have I felt so strongly the oneness of the people the world over as a\nfew days ago, when I was allowed to begin my famine visits by calling at one\nfarmhouse after another in the district on the opposite bank of the river to\nthe town of Barisal. Some of these famine-stricken dwellings belonged to\nChashas, or peasant-labourers--men, that is to say, who are employed as farm-\nhands, at a daily or monthly wage. And there were besides these the houses of\nthe well-to-do tenant farmers, brought low like all the rest in this year of\ndesolation by the very extremity of economic disaster.\n\nFor we cannot say in India, as we might perhaps in Ireland, that the higher\nclasses live on one food, and the lower on another. There is here no contrast,\nas of wheat and potatoes, so that one half of the village may experience the\nlast pangs of hunger while the other flourishes on the abundance of its own\ncrop. All over the Gangetic Plain and all over the Gangetic Delta (and it is\nconvenient to speak of all the rivers of these parts, whatever their local\nnames, as the Ganges) all classes alike live on rice.\n\np. 170\n\n[paragraph continues] And when rice fails them all alike starve. The employer\nof labour can, of course, hold out longer than the labourer he employs, in the\nbattle against want. He ought to have something in the way of money and\njewels. He has house, tools, furniture, and cattle that can (though it is to\nno one\'s interest that they should) be sold. He has even, if the worst should\ncome to the worst, a larger credit. And he uses it to the utmost. If a man be\nfound without resources in a year of supremely scanty harvest, we may be sure\nthat it will prove to be because he had already parted with home and land in\nthe former years, when ill-fortune was only growing upon him.\n\nOne home there was that I visited that morning, in which I would fain hope to\nhave made permanent friends. Its mistress was a young woman, some few years\nwidowed, whose grown-up son was the breadwinner of the family. At the hour of\nour visit he was absent, seeking employment, and they would have nothing to\ncook that day unless he should return with rice. Not that this was stated or\nobtruded upon our notice. Rather we came to understand the fact when our visit\nwas past. Meanwhile, we sat and chatted quietly in the closely-thatched\nveranda, and one noted a daughter of the household, a girl of twelve or\nfourteen, clad with the scantiness of the year\'s poverty, and sore of heart\nunder the wound\n\np. 171\n\nto her girlish pride. There was a grey-haired granddame too, who told us, not\nof the famine but of the deep abiding sorrow that all other pain was wont to\nrenew in her--the memory of the deaths, long ago, of seven stalwart sons who\nhad each grown to man\'s estate before, one by one, they left her, to wait\nalone for the word of Allah ere she might see them again in Paradise. A\nwidowed neighbour crept in to talk and listen, carrying a girl-baby in an\nextreme of emaciation, whom she was trying to nurse back into life, its own\nmother being dead. But centre of all was the gentle mistress of the home. One\ncould gather her past happiness from the story she told of the debts of the\ndead husband faithfully discharged, and by her sensitive shrinking from the\nthought of remarriage. Even as we sat talking her son came back from the city\nand handed to his mother a bag containing some four pounds of rice, earned by\ntwo days of labour, carrying bricks on the river in a boat. Work, he said, was\nabsolutely at a standstill, and one gathered from his words the fear he did\nnot utter, of the days when he must return empty-handed from such quests. What\nwould then be the fate of these helpless ones of his kindred who were\ndependent on him for food?\n\nThe cheery old Hindu gentleman who accompanied me in my visits would not,\nhowever, allow\n\np. 172\n\nany presentiment of coming evil. "Come, come, Lakshmi!" (Fortuna), he said\nsoothingly to the mother, who, weakened by long fasting, was weeping quietly\nand silently. "We shall send you help--do not you fear! And better times will\nbe with us shortly--There, there! Don\'t forget! The good days will come\nagain." Like the captain of the ship in stormy weather, it was not to the\nwomen he would admit the anxiety that was weighing upon his own kind heart,\nwith the thought of the awful month of October to November, when the money\ncontributed by the country and the last rice held by the starving people would\nalike be exhausted and heaven alone could tell where he would have to look for\nhelp.\n\nThe weeping woman dried her eyes and silently strove for self-control. And\nthen with the prayers and blessings of the aged Rizpah ringing in our ears, we\nrose to leave for the boats that awaited us. But down to the edge of the\nwater-meadows came the women to see us off. And there with my last look\nbackwards I saw them standing, their hands raised in the attitude of prayer.\nAnd I knew that they, in their want and anxiety, were giving to us, well-fed\nand well-clothed, the beautiful salutation of their people, "Peace be unto\nyou!"\n\np. 173\n\n#### II.--THE COMMONWEALTH BASED ON RICE\n\nHow futile, when one has seen a famine, sound all discussions as to whether or\nnot India in the past has known as great catastrophes! A fair mansion,\nstanding on the side of a great river, suddenly falls in a year of flood, and\nwhat remains of it henceforth is only a ruin. The house fell the moment the\nwaters reached a certain level. Yes; but it would not have fallen at such a\ntouch, only that, during long years before, the underpinnings and foundations\nhad been steadily snapped and undermined. The final calamity was only the last\nscene in a drama of disaster long proceeding in silence. And the house itself\ncould never have been built under such conditions. That is the whole argument.\nThe commonwealth was never built up under such conditions.\n\nEverything that one sees in East Bengal to-day is so much saved from happier\ntimes. Is it the pride and independence of fisher-folk and farmers? Is it the\ndelicate hospitality of starving villagers? Both alike, if the present strain\ncontinue long enough, must assuredly give way to a sordid pauperism. They\ncould never, under such disadvantages, have sprung into being. No, the ruin\nwrought by fire, or earthquake, or tidal wave, may happen in an hour. But\nfamine\n\np. 174\n\nimplies a long train of preparatory circumstances, with which a bad season, or\na series of bad seasons, suddenly coincides, to work visible devastation. That\na certain combination of bad seasons must necessarily recur in every century\nor half-century will, I presume, appear a truism to the mathematician versed\nin the doctrines of chances, And that an agricultural civilisation of three\nthousand years\' standing should be familiar with, and make provision for, the\nfact of such a recurrence, will appear equally a truism to the student of\nsociology.\n\nIt is in accordance with this fact that the people of East Bengal have been in\nthe habit of keeping always stored in their houses some two or three years\'\nprovision of rice at a time. All over India the family that is rich enough\nbuys its rice for the month or the year by the _maund_ , even as in England we\nbuy coal by the ton. 1 But the farmer was supposed never to encroach, for the\npurposes of the market, upon the store of grain that was to secure food to his\nhousehold and dependents, not only during the current year, but also during\ntwo scanty harvests ahead, should the country be so unfortunate as to\nexperience these. Now those\n\np. 175\n\nwho have followed the story I am telling will at once perceive the necessity\nof this. The convention was etiquette. It was more, it was morality--\n_Dharmma_ , the national righteousness. But it was more even than these: it\nwas plain common-sense. For we have seen that the farmer who cannot pay for\nlabour even under the agricultural mischance of a bad harvest (strictly\nparallel to a season of commercial or manufacturing debits instead of\ncredits), must necessarily fall from the position of an employer of labour\ninto that of the employee or day-labourer himself. Instead of a farmer, he is\nnow a _Chasha_ or ploughman merely. Food may return into the district, through\nrelief associations or along the railways, but this is not the same thing as\nits returning into his hands. He has lost his social status, and it will be\nlong before he can possibly regain it. The security of the farmer as a\ncapitalist depends, then, upon this one thing, and upon it alone, that he keep\nin possession a three-years supply of rice. In districts in the close\nneighbourhood of Calcutta, where the houses of the peasants are built of more\npermanent materials than further east, I know of nothing more pathetic to see\nthan the long array of village granaries, many of them structures of an\nexquisite beauty, empty.\n\np. 176\n\nThe rise in the money value of food is sufficient to explain to us the\nimpossibility for the East Bengal farmers, during recent years, of abiding by\nthe injunction of their forefathers that they should keep rice in their\ngranaries. They have lived in a world which regards it as more essential that\nthey should keep money in their purse.\n\nWhat have been the causes at work to transfer the peasant\'s ambition from rice\nto silver, from a well-filled granary to a well-filled till? For unless the\nambition has been so transferred it is clear that the money value of grain\ncould not have risen so rapidly. Only when a province has been denuded, and\nall its food has to be imported, could the crop of the country reach such\nvalues as those at present prevailing.\n\nWith regard to this question, it is perhaps sufficient to say that all over\nIndia a process is going on, in consequence of which the peasant has come to\nlook upon money as wealth. And this process may be briefly indicated by the\nstatement that rent and taxes have to be paid in coin. The foreign tax-\ngatherer, or the foreign minister of the Exchequer, knows nothing of rice as\nthe ultimate standard of value. To them the precious metals occupy this place.\nAnd here is a fact which would tend of itself to impoverish the peasant,\nrelatively to the other classes of the community,\n\np. 177\n\neven if all the wealth of India remained within her own borders. The fact that\nit does not do so is too well known to need repetition at this point. My\npresent object is merely to examine whether there be any local or little-known\ncircumstances which may recently have contributed in some special measure to\nundermine the prosperity of East Bengal, and so have prepared the way for the\ncalamity I have described.\n\n\n\nFamine is social paralysis. A civilisation that has taken thousands of years\nto build up may be shattered by a single season of it. For complete\ndestitution of all classes together, in a given area, is apt to knock out the\nlinks and rivets of the social system. At the present moment, for instance,\nthe farmers have neither money nor food to give in exchange for labour. And\nwithout labour the rice of next year cannot be saved, even to the extent that\nmight still have been possible. Under such circumstances, it is clear that\nfood given to the farmer and his peasants is not the same thing as food given\nthe farmer for his peasants. For in the latter case the food not only\nnourishes: it also leads to the putting in of labour, necessary to the next\nharvest. In the East there may be a greater readiness to return to the\ncondition of equilibrium when the shock is over than in younger lands better\nknown to ourselves. There may be: I do\n\np. 178\n\nnot know that there is, for I have not yet had the chance of seeing. But the\ndifference can only at best be one of degree. Famine involves social\ndisorganisation as one of its secondary but most far-reaching effects.\n\nFor famine is many things besides hunger. True, it is hunger so keen that one\nman whom I know, spending some days in a district as yet unrelieved, could not\nsleep at night for the wail of the famine-stricken in his ears. Hunger so\nkeen, ah God! so keen! But it is more than this, as we have already seen. It\nis the extreme of poverty, bringing among other things nakedness, darkness at\nnightfall, ignorance, and unrepair in its train. It is poverty breeding\npoverty. Under its pressure the milk-cows are sold to the butcher, sometimes\nfor eight annas or a shilling, because their owners can no longer maintain\nthem, and by the new master are killed immediately for their hides, at the\nvalue of which he bought them. When it comes, the seed of the next year is\neaten as food; the savings of lifetimes are scattered to the winds. Economic\nrelationships that seemed inherent in the social organism are broken to\npieces.\n\nBut over and above even these things, famine is more. It is the very sickle of\ndeath, selecting its victims according to a certain invisible but\npredetermined order, and what that order is, it may be worth our while to\ninquire.\n\np. 179\n\nA few years ago there was a picture on exhibition in London, called, if I am\nnot mistaken, "The Stairway of Life." At the top of wide-spreading steps stood\nyouth and maiden hand-in-hand, and then, diverging with each step downwards,\ntowards the river of death at the bottom, one saw the same pair, over and over\nagain, at the different stages of life. This picture has been constantly in my\nmind as I have gone about the famine villages. Only the river of death that I\nsee with the mind\'s eye is in flood, and at each step of the stairway stand\nthe different grades of health and society, ranked according to the likelihood\nof their being swept off by the rising waters.\n\nOn the lowest stand the beggars, for every Indian community has its quota of\nthese. There is here no poor-rate, and the hopelessly indigent and helplessly\nfeeble must needs be supported by the informal charity of the village. Lonely\nold women they are for the most part, sunned and wrinkled under all weathers,\nand they stand at the steamer- _gh ats_, or in the bazaars, staff and begging-\nbowl in hand, not the least picturesque of all the picturesque elements that\ngo to make up the Indian crowd.\n\nNaturally, these are the first inhabitants of the villages to feel the sharp\npinch of adversity, the first to throw themselves upon a wider-reaching\ncharity. Indeed the Bengali word for famine,\n\np. 180\n\n_durbhikkha_ , the "hard begging," gives us a wonderful picture of the\ndisaster from their point of view. It paints the beggars going forth in all\ndirections, and wandering far ere they find scant food. Economic pauperism is\na condition that only under very exceptional circumstances tends to bring out\nthe highest and finest elements in human character, and these Indian beggars\nof the villages are neither better nor worse than their kind in other\ncountries. Pithy and smart of repartee they sometimes are, and one cannot but\nbe entertained when the grave assurance is given that the speaker dined\nyesterday on "horse\'s eggs" (a Bengali colloquialism for no food), in the very\nface of the person, it may be, who provided her with rice. It is undoubtedly\ntrue also that the beggar is spiritually twin-brother to the millionaire. For\nthe minds of both these are concentrated upon the acquisition of wealth, in a\ndegree impossible to any intermediate rank.\n\nBut the one lesson of my pilgrimage amidst the starving has been the immensity\nof the gulf that divides the humblest of citizens from these civic paupers. It\ntakes a long series of scanty harvests to turn the poorest Indian householder\ninto a beggar. Unless this is understood, we fail of the whole moral.\n\nThe next class to be reached by the rising\n\np. 181\n\nwaters consists of the single women, respectable widows, and girls of their\nblood as yet unmarried, who have no one to work for them, and must make their\nown living by husking the rice of the farmers, and preparing it for the city-\nmarkets. These are the gleaners of Asiatic village-life: for they follow after\nthe reapers at time of harvest, and by gathering the grain that falls in their\nwake, provide themselves with food for some one or two months out of every\ntwelve. Theirs is thus the unbought store. Indeed, it is difficult to see how\nmoney ever passes through their hands, for the labour they give at rich\nfarmhouses is paid in kind rather than in coin, and probably a piece of cloth\nfrom the farmer\'s wife on the great festivals meets their need of clothing for\nthe year.\n\nOn the next level that the flood reaches are the homes of the peasants, the\nfarm-labourers. And last of the village group, but central, and first probably\nto have seen afar off the rising of the waters, are the larger farmers and\nsmall squires or zemindars.\n\nBesides these, however, who depend directly for the year\'s food upon the\nyear\'s harvest, each in his degree, there are whole classes of others who are\nindirectly but vitally affected. In the villages themselves there are the\nfishermen and boatmen. Although actively engaged in the supply of another\n\np. 182\n\nkind of food, these are as much concerned as their neighbours in the question\nof the sufficiency of the year\'s crop of rice. Indeed, in many cases they\nthemselves rent and farm a patch of land.\n\nScattered up and down the districts, again, and in the small market-towns of\nthe countryside there is the sprinkling of intellectuals. There are the\nBrahmins, or village priests; the schoolmasters; the people who have been\nemployed on railway staffs, small stationmasters and others; clerks in village\nfirms and shops, letter-writers, doctors, and the like. To these people the\ndirectly agricultural classes are as the very steps on which they stand, and\ntheir support being withdrawn, the flood of hunger must needs swallow them all\nup, the more hopelessly and inevitably since there are for them no\nintermediate phases of social degradation to be passed through. The peasant\nmay perhaps, by a slow refinement of suffering, be transformed first into a\nlandless labourer. Then, on his death or desertion, his women-folk may become\ngleaners, instead of proud mistresses of the farmstead. And finally, one or\nall of the little household may conceivably be brutalised into begging. But\nfor a gentleman--and the village schoolmaster or doctor or small squire is\nperhaps _more_ conscious of his pride of gentlehood than any proud belted earl\nin all the West!--for a gentleman, when starvation comes, there is nothing for\nit\n\np. 183\n\nbut to hide his head and die. Thus, over the wide stretches of green country,\nthe river of death has risen to the height of its flood-tide, and all the\nprosperity and joy of the little commonwealth are gone. The hive is robbed of\nits honey, those spoils of hope and cheer that were gathered in the sunshine\nand prosperity of the good years. And how shall the spiritless bees set to\nwork again to replace them?\n\n#### III.--THE TRAGEDY OF JUTE\n\nA few sociologists, notably Professor Patrick Geddes and his school, have\npointed out the necessity for studying the social significance of various\nagricultural and industrial products. Thus, if these men are correct, the\nchange by a community from the manufacture of wool to that of silk for\nexample, is not by any means so simple as would appear to the careless eye.\nEach different material imposes its different conditions of labour, and has in\na thousand ways its own characteristic necessities. Each article produced or\nmanufactured, therefore, will be found, according to these thinkers, if we\nstudy closely enough, to entail certain human adaptations peculiar to itself.\nAnd this we may refer to as its _social value_.\n\nTo most of us, however, this point of view has\n\np. 184\n\nnot yet come in sight. We do not dream that there is any other standard of\nbenefit to the worker or the consumer than the financial. And for this reason\nI hope to make extremely clear the story I am about to tell of Eastern Bengal.\n\nThirty years ago, in every cottage garden in Eastern Bengal, was found a patch\nmore or less large as the case might be, containing a tall dark herb,\nbotanically intermediate between a mallow and a flax, and known to us as jute.\n\nThe plant was grown by the peasants mainly for the sake of its fibre. This was\nvery valuable in a country where rough string and bamboo are the chief\nbuilding materials. There was also the supply of lamp-wicks to be thought of\nfor the year. The leaves of the plant, moreover, when dried, were medicinal.\nAnd finally, in the case of the Hindu at home at any rate, it could not be\ndispensed with, since it was required in certain of the year\'s religious\nfestivals. Only last year I remember, on the night of our beautiful Eastern\nFeast of Lamps as I went out through the lanes of our neighbourhood, being\nsuddenly startled by a quaint little gathering of unknown objects lying on the\nroadway in the middle of an awkward twist in a narrow street. A light, not yet\nout, and a little smouldering straw, showed that I had come upon some altar of\nworship, and I turned to my companion for an explanation. The lad who was\n\np. 185\n\nwith me smiled easily and said: "Oh this is the _A-lakkhi puja_. It is written\nthat on this night in \'some bad place,\' with jute sticks and these few things,\nwe should worship the Power that shines through the Unluck." Strange\npredestination surely: through these several centuries has Hinduism been\nworshipping the Unluck under the symbol of jute sticks!\n\nThe plant was open to the objection which applies also in the case of Irish\nflax, namely, that the long sterns had to be cut down, placed in water, and\npractically rotted, in order to get at the fibre, and this must always have\nmade it an aversion to the Hindu. Still its economic value and the\nrequirements of the faith were both imperative, and the quantity grown by each\ncottager was only such as he and his family would consume in the year.\n\nAbout some twenty to twenty-five years ago, however--owing to what chain of\nevents I do not know, for I have not traced out the history of jute as a\ncommercial product--it seems to have been discovered by the outside world, and\nits value as a fibre must have been rapidly recognised. It has the advantage,\nas we all now know, of being easily woven into any one of a number of\nattractive looking materials, some of which resemble silk and others flannel.\nIt has the further advantage, from the modern shopkeeper\'s point of\n\np. 186\n\nview, that it will not wear long, and therefore necessitates that rapid\nsuccession of garments which change of fashion is in itself only another\ndevice for bringing about. And it is further said that Bengal is the only\ncountry in the world in which it can be produced. Here then was the tragedy\nincipient. Twenty years ago, it is said, the cultivation of jute made its\nappearance on something of a commercial scale in these East Bengal districts.\nAt first, however, it spread slowly. But some seven or eight years ago 1 it\nmade a sudden advance, and to-day the culture of the plant is going forward by\nleaps and bounds. As one goes down the river from Khulna to Barisal, one sees\non all hands the fields of jute alternating with the fields of rice, and this\nparticular line of country is not as yet one of the worst infected. As one\nwatches the boats being loaded it is always with jute, and even about\nCalcutta, hour after hour, day after day, the carts come pouring in along the\nopen country roads, laden with their bales of jute. In this way the Granary of\nBengal has been and is being transformed into one vast jute plantation. The\ntemptation to the peasant was, what it always is everywhere, recklessness as\nto the future in the face of a large financial reward, for jute at present\nbrings him a good price. In the\n\np. 187\n\nsame way, as we all know, the peasants of Norway have denuded their beautiful\nmountains in many cases of their forests, careless always of the interests of\nthe future, in face of that crushing need of the present which is the curse of\nthe modern and especially of the poorer world. And in East Bengal the\ndiscovery of jute coincided with that other process by which the Commonwealth\nbased upon Rice was being transformed inevitably into the Commonwealth based\nupon Money.\n\nSuch was the temptation, but in fact the bribe was a delusive one. For jute\nrequires, for its successful culture, practically the same fields which are\nmost favourable to rice. Thus the two crops cannot well be grown in rotation,\nsince the soil will not afterwards produce such good rice, if, indeed, any.\nBesides, as we know, though the peasant cannot, the high prices will no longer\nbe available when the growth is once universally established.\n\nThis then is what has made the present situation so hopeless. It is not only\nthat there is no rice in the village. But far off, in lands from which the\nvillage might have drawn a supply, or at least from which some place\naccessible to it might have done so, there is no rice either. For these last\nfew years, with increasing speed, all alike have been abandoning the old ideal\nof the conserving of rice in favour of the\n\np. 188\n\nnew wealth-producer of the hour. Till to-day, even when relief was to be\nbrought, there was nowhere from which to bring it but distant Rangoon.\n\nThus the mysterious prescience of ancient faiths is justified. When the Roman\nEmpire was but young, it may be, the simple peasants of the Gangetic Delta\nalready worshipped the Power in the Unluck under the strangely-chosen symbol\nof the jute-herb, and to-day an Arctic winter of starvation has spread its\nmantle over them, largely through the agency of this old-time acquaintance.\nBut what are we to say, we others, who by our greed and luxury have written so\nmany chapters in the Martyrdom of Man, as indigo, opium, india-rubber, and now\njute?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[174:1](seh26.htm#fr_3) A _maund_ is about 80 lbs., _i.e._ about \xc2\xbe cwt.
