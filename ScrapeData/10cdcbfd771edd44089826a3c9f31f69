Not that the bonds of law have ceased to exist\nfor them--but that the bonds have become to them as the form of freedom\nincarnate. The freed soul delights in accepting bonds, and does not seek to\nevade any of them, for in each does it feel the manifestation of an infinite\nenergy whose joy is in creation.\n\nAs a matter of fact, where there are no bonds, where there is the madness of\nlicense, the soul ceases to be free. There is its hurt; there is its\nseparation from the infinite, its agony of sin. Whenever at the call of\ntemptation the soul falls away from the bondage of law, then, like a child\ndeprived of the support of its mother\'s arms, it cries out, _Smite me not!_\n42 "Bind me," it prays, "oh, bind me in the bonds of thy law; bind me within\nand without; hold me tight; let me in the clasp of thy law be bound up\ntogether with thy joy; protect me by thy firm hold from the deadly laxity of\nsin."\n\nAs some, under the idea that law is the opposite of joy, mistake intoxication\nfor joy, so there are many in our country who imagine action to be opposed to\nfreedom. They think that activity being in the material plane is a restriction\nof the free spirit of the soul. But we must remember that as joy expresses\nitself in law, so the soul finds its freedom in action. It is because joy\ncannot find expression in itself alone that it desires the law which is\noutside. Likewise it is because the soul cannot find freedom within itself\nthat it wants external action. The soul of man is ever freeing itself from its\nown folds by its activity; had it been otherwise it could not have done any\nvoluntary work.\n\nThe more man acts and makes actual what was latent in him, the nearer does he\nbring the distant Yet-to-be. In that actualisation man is ever making himself\nmore and yet more distinct, and seeing himself clearly under newer and newer\naspects in the midst of his varied activities, in the state, in society. This\nvision makes for freedom.\n\nFreedom is not in darkness, nor in vagueness. There is no bondage so fearful\nas that of obscurity. It is to escape from this obscurity that the seed\nstruggles to sprout, the bud to blossom. It is to rid itself of this envelope\nof vagueness that the ideas in our mind are constantly seeking opportunities\nto take on outward form. In the same way our soul, in order to release itself\nfrom the mist of indistinctness and come out into the open, is continually\ncreating for itself fresh fields of action, and is busy contriving new forms\nof activity, even such as are not needful for the purposes of its earthly\nlife. And why? Because it wants freedom. It wants to see itself, to realise\nitself.\n\nWhen man cuts down the pestilential jungle and makes unto himself a garden,\nthe beauty that he thus sets free from within its enclosure of ugliness is the\nbeauty of his own soul: without giving it this freedom outside, he cannot make\nit free within. When he implants law and order in the midst of the waywardness\nof society, the good which he sets free from the obstruction of the bad is the\ngoodness of his own soul: without being thus made free outside it cannot find\nfreedom within. Thus is man continually engaged in setting free in action his\npowers, his beauty, his goodness, his very soul. And the more he succeeds in\nso doing, the greater does he see himself to be, the broader becomes the field\nof his knowledge of self.\n\nThe Upanishad says: _In the midst of activity alone wilt thou desire to live a\nhundred years._  43 It is the saying of those who had amply tasted of the joy\nof the soul. Those who have fully realised the soul have never talked in\nmournful accents of the sorrowfulness of life or of the bondage of action.\nThey are not like the weakling flower whose stem-hold is so light that it\ndrops away before attaining fruition. They hold on to life with all their\nmight and say, "never will we let go till the fruit is ripe." They desire in\ntheir joy to express themselves strenuously in their life and in their work.\nPain and sorrow dismay them not, they are not bowed down to the dust by the\nweight of their own heart. With the erect head of the victorious hero they\nmarch through life seeing themselves and showing themselves in increasing\nresplendence of soul through both joys and sorrows. The joy of their life\nkeeps step with the joy of that energy which is playing at building and\nbreaking throughout the universe. The joy of the sunlight, the joy of the free\nair, mingling with the joy of their lives, makes one sweet harmony reign\nwithin and without. It is they who say, _In the midst of activity alone wilt\nthou desire to live a hundred years._\n\nThis joy of life, this joy of work, in man is absolutely true. It is no use\nsaying that it is a delusion of ours; that unless we cast it away we cannot\nenter upon the path of self-realisation. It will never do the least good to\nattempt the realisation of the infinite apart from the world of action.\n\nIt is not the truth that man is active on compulsion. If there is compulsion\non one side, on the other there is pleasure; on the one hand action is spurred\non by want, on the other it hies to its natural fulfilment. That is why, as\nman\'s civilisation advances, he increases his obligations and the work that he\nwillingly creates for himself. One should have thought that nature had given\nhim quite enough to do to keep him busy, in fact that it was working him to\ndeath with the lash of hunger and thirst,--but no. Man does not think that\nsufficient; he cannot rest content with only doing the work that nature\nprescribes for him in common with the birds and beasts. He needs must surpass\nall, even in activity. No creature has to work so hard as man; he has been\nimpelled to contrive for himself a vast field of action in society; and in\nthis field he is for every building up and pulling down, making and unmaking\nlaws, piling up heaps of material, and incessantly thinking, seeking and\nsuffering. In this field he has fought his mightiest battles, gained continual\nnew life, made death glorious, and, far from evading troubles, has willingly\nand continually taken up the burden of fresh trouble. He has discovered the\ntruth that he is not complete in the cage of his immediate surroundings, that\nhe is greater than his present, and that while to stand still in one place may\nbe comforting, the arrest of life destroys his true function and the real\npurpose of his existence.\n\nThis _mahat \xc4\xab vinashtih--this great destruction_ he cannot bear, and\naccordingly he toils and suffers in order that he may gain in stature by\ntranscending his present, in order to become that which he yet is not. In this\ntravail is man\'s glory, and it is because he knows it, that he has not sought\nto circumscribe his field of action, but is constantly occupied in extending\nthe bounds. Sometimes he wanders so far that his work tends to lose its\nmeaning, and his rushings to and fro create fearful eddies round different\ncentres--eddies of self-interest, of pride of power. Still, so long as the\nstrength of the current is not lost, there is no fear; the obstructions and\nthe dead accumulations of his activity are dissipated and carried away; the\nimpetus corrects its own mistakes. Only when the soul sleeps in stagnation do\nits enemies gain overmastering strength, and these obstructions become too\nclogging to be fought through. Hence have we been warned by our teachers that\nto work we must live, to live we must work; that life and activity are\ninseparably connected.\n\nIt is very characteristic of life that it is not complete within itself; it\nmust come out. Its truth is in the commerce of the inside and the outside. In\norder to live, the body must maintain its various relations with the outside\nlight and air--not only to gain life-force, but also to manifest it. Consider\nhow fully employed the body is with its own inside activities; its heart- beat\nmust not stop for a second, its stomach, its brain, must be ceaselessly\nworking. Yet this is not enough; the body is outwardly restless all the while.\nIts life leads it to an endless dance of work and play outside; it cannot be\nsatisfied with the circulations of its internal economy, and only finds the\nfulfilment of joy in its outward excursions.\n\nThe same with the soul. It cannot live on its own internal feelings and\nimaginings. It is ever in need of external objects; not only to feed its inner\nconsciousness but to apply itself in action, not only to receive but also to\ngive.\n\nThe real truth is, we cannot live if we divide him who is truth itself into\ntwo parts. We must abide in him within as well as without. In whichever aspect\nwe deny him we deceive ourselves and incur a loss. _Brahma has not left me,\nlet me not leave Brahma._  44 If we say that we would realise him in\nintrospection alone and leave him out of our external activity, that we would\nenjoy him by the love in our heart, but not worship him by outward\nministrations; or if we say the opposite, and overweight ourselves on one side\nin the journey of our life\'s quest, we shall alike totter to our downfall.\n\nIn the great western continent we see that the soul of man is mainly concerned\nwith extending itself outwards; the open field of the exercise of power is its\nfield. Its partiality is entirely for the world of extension, and it would\nleave aside-- nay, hardly believe in--that field of inner consciousness which\nis the field of fulfilment. It has gone so far in this that the perfection of\nfulfilment seems to exist for it nowhere. Its science has always talked of the\nnever-ending evolution of the world. Its metaphysic has now begun to talk of\nthe evolution of God himself. They will not admit that he _is_ ; they would\nhave it that he also is _becoming._\n\nThey fail to realise that while the infinite is always greater than any\nassignable limit, it is also complete; that on the one hand Brahma is\nevolving, on the other he is perfection; that in the one aspect he is essence,\nin the other manifestation--both together at the same time, as is the song and\nthe act of singing. This is like ignoring the consciousness of the singer and\nsaying that only the singing is in progress, that there is no song. Doubtless\nwe are directly aware only of the singing, and never at any one time of the\nsong as a whole; but do we not all the time know that the complete song is in\nthe soul of the singer?\n\nIt is because of this insistence on the doing and the becoming that we\nperceive in the west the intoxication of power. These men seem to have\ndetermined to despoil and grasp everything by force. They would always\nobstinately be doing and never be done-- they would not allow to death its\nnatural place in the scheme of things--they know not the beauty of completion.\n\nIn our country the danger comes from the opposite side. Our partiality is for\nthe internal world. We would cast aside with contumely the field of power and\nof extension. We would realise Brahma in mediation only in his aspect of\ncompleteness, we have determined not to see him in the commerce of the\nuniverse in his aspect of evolution. That is why in our seekers we so often\nfind the intoxication of the spirit and its consequent degradation. Their\nfaith would acknowledge no bondage of law, their imagination soars\nunrestricted, their conduct disdains to offer any explanation to reason. Their\nintellect, in its vain attempts to see Brahma inseparable from his creation,\nworks itself stone- dry, and their heart, seeking to confine him within its\nown outpourings, swoons in a drunken ecstasy of emotion. They have not even\nkept within reach any standard whereby they can measure the loss of strength\nand character which manhood sustains by thus ignoring the bonds of law and the\nclaims of action in the external universe.\n\nBut true spirituality, as taught in our sacred lore, is calmly balanced in\nstrength, in the correlation of the within and the without. The truth has its\nlaw, it has its joy. On one side of it is being chanted the _Bhay\n\xc4\x81dasy\xc4\x81gnistapati_  45 , on the other the _\xc4\x80 nand\xc4\x81dhyeva khalvim\xc4\x81ni bh\xc5\xabt\xc4\x81ni\nj\xc4\x81yante._  46 Freedom is impossible of attainment without submission to law,\nfor Brahma is in one aspect bound by his truth, in the other free in his joy.\n\nAs for ourselves, it is only when we wholly submit to the bonds of truth that\nwe fully gain the joy of freedom. And how? As does the string that is bound to\nthe harp. When the harp is truly strung, when there is not the slightest\nlaxity in the strength of the bond, then only does music result; and the\nstring transcending itself in its melody finds at every chord its true\nfreedom. It is because it is bound by such hard and fast rules on the one side\nthat it can find this range of freedom in music on the other. While the string\nwas not true, it was indeed merely bound; but a loosening of its bondage would\nnot have been the way to freedom, which it can only fully achieve by being\nbound tighter and tighter till it has attained the true pitch.\n\nThe bass and treble strings of our duty are only bonds so long as we cannot\nmaintain them steadfastly attuned according to the law of truth; and we cannot\ncall by the name of freedom the loosening of them into the nothingness of\ninaction. That is why I would say that the true striving in the quest of\ntruth, of _dharma_ , consists not in the neglect of action but in the effort\nto attune it closer and closer to the eternal harmony. The text of this\nstriving should be, _Whatever works thou doest, consecrate them to Brahma._\n47 That is to say, the soul is to dedicate itself to Brahma through all its\nactivities. This dedication is the song of the soul, in this is its freedom.\nJoy reigns when all work becomes the path to the union with Brahma; when the\nsoul ceases to return constantly to its own desires; when in it our self-\noffering grows more and more intense. Then there is completion, then there is\nfreedom, then, in this world, comes the kingdom of God.\n\nWho is there that, sitting in his corner, would deride this grand self-\nexpression of humanity in action, this incessant self- consecration? Who is\nthere that thinks the union of God and man is to be found in some secluded\nenjoyment of his own imaginings, away from the sky-towering temple of the\ngreatness of humanity, which the whole of mankind, in sunshine and storm, is\ntoiling to erect through the ages? Who is there that thinks this secluded\ncommunion is the highest form of religion?\n\nO thou distraught wanderer, thou _Sannyasin_ , drunk in the wine of self-\nintoxication, dost thou not already hear the progress of the human soul along\nthe highway traversing the wide fields of humanity--the thunder of its\nprogress in the car of its achievements, which is destined to overpass the\nbounds that prevent its expansion into the universe? The very mountains are\ncleft asunder and give way before the march of its banners waving triumphantly\nin the heavens; as the mist before the rising sun, the tangled obscurities of\nmaterial things vanish at its irresistible approach. Pain, disease, and\ndisorder are at every step receding before its onset; the obstructions of\nignorance are being thrust aside; the darkness of blindness is being pierced\nthrough; and behold, the promised land of wealth and health, of poetry and\nart, of knowledge and righteousness is gradually being revealed to view. Do\nyou in your lethargy desire to say that this car of humanity, which is shaking\nthe very earth with the triumph of its progress along the mighty vistas of\nhistory, has no charioteer leading it on to its fulfilment? Who is there who\nrefuses to respond to his call to join in this triumphal progress? Who so\nfoolish as to run away from the gladsome throng and seek him in the\nlistlessness of inaction? Who so steeped in untruth as to dare to call all\nthis untrue--this great world of men, this civilisation of expanding humanity,\nthis eternal effort of man, through depths of sorrow, through heights of\ngladness, through innumerable impediments within and without, to win victory\nfor his powers? He who can think of this immensity of achievement as an\nimmense fraud, can he truly believe in God who is the truth? He who thinks to\nreach God by running away from the world, when and where does he expect to\nmeet him? How far can he fly--can he fly and fly, till he flies into\nnothingness itself? No, the coward who would fly can nowhere find him. We must\nbe brave enough to be able to say: We are reaching him here in this very spot,\nnow at this very moment. We must be able to assure ourselves that as in our\nactions we are realising ourselves, so in ourselves we are realising him who\nis the self of self. We must earn the right to say so unhesitatingly by\nclearing away with our own effort all obstruction, all disorder, all discords\nfrom our path of activity; we must be able to say, "In my work is my joy, and\nin that joy does the joy of my joy abide."\n\nWhom does the Upanishad call _The chief among the knowers of Brahma?_  48 He\nis defined as _He whose joy is in Brahma, whose play is in Brahma, the active\none._  49 Joy without the play of joy is no joy at all--play without activity\nis no play. Activity is the play of joy. He whose joy is in Brahma, how can he\nlive in inaction? For must he not by his activity provide that in which the\njoy of Brahma is to take form and manifest itself? That is why he who knows\nBrahma, who has his joy in Brahma, must also have all his activity in Brahma--\nhis eating and drinking, his earning of livelihood and his beneficence. Just\nas the joy of the poet in his poem, of the artist in his art, of the brave man\nin the output of his courage, of the wise man in his discernment of truths,\never seeks expression in their several activities, so the joy of the knower of\nBrahma, in the whole of his everyday work, little and big, in truth, in\nbeauty, in orderliness and in beneficence, seeks to give expression to the\ninfinite.\n\nBrahma himself gives expression to his joy in just the same way. _By his many-\nsided activity, which radiates in all directions, does he fulfil the inherent\nwant of his different creatures._  50 That inherent want is he himself, and so\nhe is in so many ways, in so many forms, giving himself. He works, for without\nworking how could he give himself. His joy is ever dedicating itself in the\ndedication which is his creation.\n\nIn this very thing does our own true meaning lie, in this is our likeness to\nour father. We must also give up ourselves in many- sided variously aimed\nactivity. In the Vedas he is called _the giver of himself, the giver of\nstrength._  51 He is not content with giving us himself, but he gives us\nstrength that we may likewise give ourselves. That is why the seer of the\nUpanishad prays to him who is thus fulfilling our wants, _May he grant us the\nbeneficent mind_  52 , may he fulfil that uttermost want of ours by granting\nus the beneficent mind. That is to say, it is not enough he should alone work\nto remove our want, but he should give us the desire and the strength to work\nwith him in his activity and in the exercise of the goodness. Then, indeed,\nwill our union with him alone be accomplished. The beneficent mind is that\nwhich shows us the want ( _sw \xc4\x81rtha_) of another self to be the inherent want\n( _nihit \xc4\x81rtha_) of our own self; that which shows that our joy consists in\nthe varied aiming of our many-sided powers in the work of humanity. When we\nwork under the guidance of this beneficent mind, then our activity is\nregulated, but does not become mechanical; it is action not goaded on by want,\nbut stimulated by the satisfaction of the soul. Such activity ceases to be a\nblind imitation of that of the multitude, a cowardly following of the dictates\nof fashion. Therein we begin to see that _He is in the beginning and in the\nend of the universe_  53 , and likewise see that of our own work is he the\nfount and the inspiration, and at the end thereof is he, and therefore that\nall our activity is pervaded by peace and good and joy.\n\nThe Upanishad says: _Knowledge, power, and action are of his nature._  54 It\nis because this naturalness has not yet been born in us that we tend to divide\njoy from work. Our day of work is not our day of joy-- for that we require a\nholiday; for, miserable that we are, we cannot find our holiday in our work.\nThe river finds its holiday in its onward flow, the fire in its outburst of\nflame, the scent of the flower in its permeation of the atmosphere; but in our\neveryday work there is no such holiday for us. It is because we do not let\nourselves go, because we do not give ourselves joyously and entirely up to it,\nthat our work overpowers us.\n\nO giver of thyself! at the vision of thee as joy let our souls flame up to\nthee as the fire, flow on to thee as the river, permeate thy being as the\nfragrance of the flower. Give us strength to love, to love fully, our life in\nits joys and sorrows, in its gains and losses, in its rise and fall. Let us\nhave strength enough fully to see and hear thy universe, and to work with full\nvigour therein. Let us fully live the life thou hast given us, let us bravely\ntake and bravely give. This is our prayer to thee. Let us once for all\ndislodge from our minds the feeble fancy that would make out thy joy to be a\nthing apart from action, thin, formless, and unsustained. Wherever the peasant\ntills the hard earth, there does thy joy gush out in the green of the corn,\nwherever man displaces the entangled forest, smooths the stony ground, and\nclears for himself a homestead, there does thy joy enfold it in orderliness\nand peace.\n\nO worker of the universe! We would pray to thee to let the irresistible\ncurrent of thy universal energy come like the impetuous south wind of spring,\nlet it come rushing over the vast field of the life of man, let it bring the\nscent of many flowers, the murmurings of many woodlands, let it make sweet and\nvocal the lifelessness of our dried-up soul-life. Let our newly awakened\npowers cry out for unlimited fulfilment in leaf and flower and fruit.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[42](sadh08.htm#fr_41) M\xc4\x81 m\xc4\x81 hims\xc4\xabh.\n\n[43](sadh08.htm#fr_42) Kurvann\xc4\x93v\xc4\x93ha karm\xc4\x81ni jij\xc4\xabvishet \xc3\xa7atam sam\xc4\x81h.\n\n[44](sadh08.htm#fr_43) M\xc4\x81ham brahma nir\xc4\x81kuryy\xc4\x81m m\xc4\x81 m\xc4\x81 brahma nir\xc4\x81kar\xc5\x8dt.\n\n[45](sadh08.htm#fr_44) "For fear of him the fire doth burn," etc\n\n[46](sadh08.htm#fr_45) "From Joy are born all created things," etc.\n\n[47](sadh08.htm#fr_46) Yadyat karma prakurv\xc4\xabta tadbrahmani samarpayet.\n\n[48](sadh08.htm#fr_47) Brahmavid\xc4\x81mvaristhah.\n\n[49](sadh08.htm#fr_48) \xc4\x80tmakr\xc4\xabrha \xc4\x81tmaratih kriy\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81n.\n\n[50](sadh08.htm#fr_49) Bahudh\xc4\x81 \xc3\xa7akti yog\xc4\x81t var\xc5\x86\xc4\x81nanek\xc4\x81n nihit\xc4\x81rtho dadh\xc4\x81ti.\n\n[51](sadh08.htm#fr_50) \xc4\x80tmad\xc4\x81 balad\xc4\x81.\n\n[52](sadh08.htm#fr_51) Sa no buddhya \xc3\xa7ubhay\xc4\x81 samyunaktu.\n\n[53](sadh08.htm#fr_52) Vichaiti ch\xc4\x81nt\xc4\x93 vi\xc3\xa7vam\xc4\x81dau.\n\n[54](sadh08.htm#fr_53) Sv\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81vik\xc4\xabjn\xc4\x81na bala kriy\xc4\x81 cha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII: The Realisation of Beauty](sadh09.htm)\n\n'
