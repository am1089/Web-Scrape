Be messengers despatched  \nOn coursers ne'er for fleetness matched,  \nTo seek my father's home and lead  \nMy Bharat back with all their speed.  \nAnd, Rama, as I ween that thou  \nWilt scarce endure to linger now,  \nSo surely it were wise and good  \nThis hour to journey to the wood.  \nAnd if, with shame cast down and weak,  \nNo word to thee the king can speak,  \nForgive, and from thy mind dismiss  \nA trifle in an hour like this.  \nBut till thy feet in rapid haste  \nHave left the city for the waste,  \nAnd to the distant forest fled,  \nHe will not bathe nor call for bread.'  \n\n'Woe! woe!' from the sad monarch burst,  \nIn surging floods of grief immersed;  \nThen swooning, with his wits astray,  \nUpon the gold-wrought couch he lay,  \nAnd Rama raised the aged king:  \nBut the stern queen, unpitying,  \nChecked not her needless words, nor spared  \nThe hero for all speed prepared,  \nBut urged him with her bitter tongue,  \nLike a good horse with lashes stung.  \nShe spoke her shameful speech. Serene  \nHe heard the fury of the queen,  \nAnd to her words so vile and dread  \nGently, unmoved in mind, he said:  \n'I would not in this world remain  \nA grovelling thrall to paltry gain,  \nBut duty's path would fain pursue,  \nTrue as the saints themselves are true.  \nFrom death itself I would not fly  \nMy father's wish to gratify.  \nWhat deed soe'er his loving son  \nMay do to please him, think it done.  \nAmid all duties, Queen, I count  \nThis duty first and paramount,  \nThat sons, obedient, aye fulfil  \nTheir honoured fathers' word and will.  \nWithout his word, if thou decree,  \nForth to the forest will I flee,  \nAnd there shall fourteen years be spent  \nMid lonely wilds in banishment.  \nMethinks thou couldst not hope to find  \nOne spark of virtue in my mind,  \nIf thou, whose wish is still my lord,  \nHast for this grace the king implored.  \nThis day I go, but, ere we part,  \nMust cheer my Sita's tender heart.  \nTo my dear mother bid farewell;  \nThen to the woods, a while to dwell.  \nWith thee, O Queen, the care must rest  \nThat Bharat hear his sire's behest,  \nAnd guard the land with righteous sway,  \nFor such the law that lives for aye.'  \n\nIn speechless woe the father heard,  \nWept with loud cries, but spoke no word.  \nThen Rama touched his senseless feet,  \nAnd hers, for honour most unmeet;  \nRound both his circling steps he bent,  \nThen from the bower the hero went.  \nSoon as he reached the gate he found  \nHis dear companions gathered round.  \nBehind him came Sumitras child  \nWith weeping eyes so sad and wild.  \nThen saw he all that rich array  \nOf vases for the glorious day.  \nRound them with reverent stops he paced,  \nNor veiled his eye, nor moved in haste.  \nThe loss of empire could not dim  \nThe glory that encompassed him.  \nSo will the Lord of Cooling Rays  1  \nOn whom the world delights to gaze,  \nThrough the great love of all retain  \nSweet splendour in the time of wane.  \nNow to the exile's lot resigned  \nHe left the rule of earth behind:  \nAs though all worldly cares he spurned  \nNo trouble was in him discerned.  \nThe chouries that for kings are used,  \nAnd white umbrella, he refused,  \nDismissed his chariot and his men,  \nAnd every friend and citizen.  \nHe ruled his senses, nor betrayed  \nThe grief that on his bosom weighed,  \nAnd thus his mother's mansion sought  \nTo tell the mournful news he brought.  \nNor could the gay-clad people there  \nWho flocked round Rama true and fair,  \nOne sign of altered fortune trace  \nUpon the splendid hero's face.  \nNor had the chieftain, mighty-armed.  \nLost the bright look all hearts that charmed,  \n\np. 116  \n\nAs e'en from autumn moons is thrown  \nA splendour which is all their own.  \nWith his sweet voice the hero spoke  \nSaluting all the gathered folk,  \nThen righteous-souled and great in fame  \nClose to his mother's house he came.  \nLakshman the brave, his brother's peer  \nIn princely virtues, followed near,  \nSore troubled, but resolved to show  \nNo token of his secret woe.  \nThus to the palace Rama went  \n   Where all were gay with hope and joy;  \nBut well he knew the dire event  \n   That hope would mar, that bliss destroy.  \nSo to his grief he would not yield  \n   Lest the sad change their hearts might rend,  \nAnd, the dread tiding unrevealed,  \n   Spared from the blow each faithful friend.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[115:1](ry097.htm#fr_286) The Moon.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XX.: Kaus'alya's Lament.](ry098.htm)\n\n"
