No two ever cover quite the same\nconception.\n\nIt is so with that symbolism which we know as language. The simple daily needs\nof mankind, seem, the world over, to be one. We look, therefore, for words\nthat correspond in every land.\n\nYet we know how the tongue of each people expresses some one group of ideas\nwith especial clearness, and ignores others altogether. Never do we find an\nidentical strength and weakness repeated: and always if we go deep enough, we\ncan discover in the circumstances and habits of a country, a cause for its\nspecific difference of thought or of expression.\n\nIn the North we speak of a certain hour as "twilight," implying a space of\ntime between the day and night. In India, the sane moments receive the name of\n"time of union," since there is no period of half-light,--the hours of sun and\ndarkness seeming to touch each other in a point.\n\np. 12\n\nThe illustration can be carried further. In the word gloaming lies for us a\nwealth of associations,--the throbbing of the falling dusk, the tenderness of\nhome-coming, the last sleepy laughter of children. The same emotional note is\nstruck in Indian languages by the expression _at the hour of cowdust_.\n\nHow graphic is the difference! Yonder, beyond the grass, the cow-girl leads\nher cattle home to the village for the night. Their feet as they go strike the\ndust from the sun-baked path into a cloud behind them. The herd-girl herself\nlooms large across the pasture--all things grow quickly dim, as if the air\nwere filled with rising dust.\n\nThat word _cowdust_ , indeed, strikes a whole vein of expression peculiar to\nthis Eastern land. Everything about the cow has been observed and loved and\nnamed. As much water as will lie in the hole once made by its hoof is a well\nknown measure amongst the Aryan folk!\n\nIt is unnecessary to argue further\n\np. 13\n\nthat while the facts of nature determine the main developments of speech, yet\nevery language and group of languages differs from every other as the\ncharacters of individuals and of nations.\n\n\n\nSomething of the same sort is true of religious symbols. Short of perfect\nrealization, we must see the Eternal Light through a mask imposed by our own\nthought. To no two of us, probably, is the mask quite in the same place, and\nsome reach, by their own growth, diverging points so distant from the common\ncentre that they mark the extreme limits hitherto achieved of those great\nareas known as the Christian, or the Buddhist, or the this-that-or-the-other\nconsciousness.\n\nTo do this, or even to carry a whole race to a new rallying-place round a\nstandard planted on the old frontier is the peculiar mission of religious\ngenius.\n\nSo Jesus swept down in His might on the old Jewish entrenchments of justice--\nrighteousness\n\np. 14\n\nand carried the banner off bodily to that outpost of love and mercy which\nstruggling souls had reached, indeed, before Him, but which none had yet been\nstrong enough to make the very heart and focus of vitality.\n\nAnd so every one of us, simply by thinking his own thought, and living his own\nlife to the full, may be answering his brother\'s cry for God in ways beyond\nthe dreaming of the world. Are Catholic possibilities not richer for the life\nof Manning, or Protestant for Frances Ridley Havergal?\n\nThese things being true, the imagery of all men has its significance for us.\nThe mask is created by our own thought directly, and indirectly through the\nreaction of custom upon thought. Like all veils, it brings at once vision and\n\nthe limiting of vision. Only by realising the full sense of every symbol can\nwe know the whole thought of Humanity about God.\n\n\n\nBut down with all masks!\n\nThe Uncreated Flame itself we\n\np. 15\n\nlong for, without symbol or veil or barrier. If we cannot see God and live,--\nlet us then die--what is there to fear? Consume us in primal fire, dissolve us\ninto living ocean, but interpose nothing, no, nor the shadow of anything,\nbetween the soul and the divine draught for which it thirsts!\n\n\n\nTrue. Yet for each of us there is a chosen way. We ourselves may still be\nseeking it, where and when still hidden from our eyes. But deep in our hearts\nis rooted the assurance that the moment will yet come, the secret signal be\nexchanged, the mystic name will fall upon our ears, and somewhere, somewhen,\nsomehow, our feet shall pass within the gates of Peace, we shall enter on the\nroad that ends only with the Beatific Vision.\n\nTill then, well says the old Hindu poet of the folk-song to himself:--\n\n"Tulsi, coming into this world,  \nSeek thou to live with all  \nFor who knows where or in what guise,  \nThe Lord Himself may come to thee?"\n\np. 16\n\nOur daily life creates our symbol of God.\n\nTo the Arab of the desert, with his patriarchal customs, the father of the\nfamily,--just and calm in his judgments, protector of his kindred, loving to\nthose who played about his knees as babes,--may well stand as the type of all\nin which men feel security.\n\nNaturally, then, it was the Semitic mind that flashed across the dim communing\nof the soul with the Eternal, the rapturous illumination of the great word\n"Father."\n\nGod our father,--bound even to the most erring of His children by a kinship\nthat misdoing cannot break (for if the human tie be indissoluble, shall the\ndivine be less so?); father,--by a tie so intimate that to this day the\nstalwart Afghan, prostrating in the mosque, says "Thee" and "Thou" to the God\nof Hosts, as might an infant on its father\'s knee!\n\nIn the Aryan home, woman stands supreme. As wife in the West,--lady and queen\nof her husband--as mother in the East,--a goddess\n\np. 17\n\nthroned in her son\'s worship,--she is the bringer of sanctity and peace.\n\nProfound depths stir within us, in presence of the intensely Christian\nconception of God--a child in His mother\'s arms. This ideal of the heart of a\nwoman--pierced by its seven sorrows, on fire with love, mother beside the\ncradle, worshipper beneath the cross, and glorified in great humility,--has\nbeen one of the richest gifts of the Catholic Church to humanity.\n\nPeerless in its own way is the womanhood of Rossetti\'s sonnet:--\n\n"This is that blessed Mary, pre-elect  \nGod\'s Virgin. Gone is a great while, and she  \nDwelt young in Nazareth of Galilee . .  \nUnto God\'s will she brought devout respect,--  \nProfound simplicity of intellect,  \nAnd supreme patience . . . . . .  \nThus held she through her girlhood,  \nAs it were an angel-watered lily,  \nThat near God grows, and is quiet."\n\n\n\nJesus Himself--to those who kneel before no Madonna in the Vatican--sounds\nthis note of the\n\np. 18\n\neternal feminine. "Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and\nI will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and\nlowly of heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls." Is it not a woman\'s\ncry?\n\nNay, He is conscious of this element in His own nature. Once at least He\nspeaks of it. In that sublime moment when He, the young Leader of the armies\nof the future, stands on the sunlit mountains, and looking down upon the city\nof His race sees the dark shadow of destiny wrapping it about, in that moment\nwhen the Patriot forgets, in a sob of human anguish, that He is Master and\nRedeemer, in that moment He becomes all motherhood. "O Jerusalem! Jerusalem!\nThou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee,--how\noften would I have gathered thy children together, like as a hen gathereth her\nchickens under her wings, and ye would not!"\n\np. 19\n\nThe soul that worships becomes always a little child: the soul that becomes a\nchild finds God oftenest as mother. In a meditation before the Blessed\nSacrament, some pen has written the exquisite assurance: "My child, you need\nnot know much in order to please Me. Only love Me dearly. Speak to me, as you\nwould talk to your mother, if she had taken you in her arms."\n\nBut it is in India that this thought of the mother has been realised in its\ncompleteness. In that country where the image of Kali is one of the most\npopular symbols of deity, it is quite customary to speak of God, as "She," and\nthe direct address then offered is simply "Mother."\n\nBut under what strange guise! In the West, art and poetry have been exhausted\nto associate all that is tender and precious with this thought of woman-\nworship. The mother plays with the little One, or caresses or nurses Him.\nSometimes she even makes her arm a throne, whereon He sits to bless the world.\n\np. 20\n\nIn the East, the accepted symbol is of a woman nude, with flowing hair, so\ndark a blue that she seems in colour to be black, four-handed---two hands in\nthe act of blessing, and two holding a knife and bleeding head respectively,--\ngarlanded with skulls, and dancing, with protruding tongue, on the prostrate\nfigure of a man all white with ashes.\n\nA terrible, an extraordinary figure! Those who call it horrible may well be\nforgiven. They pass only through the outer court of the temple. They are not\narrived where the Mother\'s voice can reach them. This, in its own way is well.\n\nVet, this image, so fearful to the Western mind, is perhaps dearer than any\nother to the heart of India. It is not, indeed, the only form in which the\nDivine Energy presents Herself to Her worshippers. To the Sikh, She is\nabsorbed, embodied in his sword; all women, especially as children, are Her\nincarnations; glorious Sita carries the great reality to many.\n\np. 21\n\nBut Kali comes closer to us than these. Others we admire; others we love; to\nHer we belong. Whether we know it or not, we are Her children, playing round\nHer knees. Life is but a game of hide-and-seek with Her, and if, in its\ncourse, we chance to touch Her feet, who can measure the shock of the divine\nenergy that enters into us? Who can utter the rapture of our cry of "Mother?"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vision of Siva](ktm03.htm)\n\n'
