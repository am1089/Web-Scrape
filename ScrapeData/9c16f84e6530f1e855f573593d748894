MASTER, kindly and benevolent,\n\n  His servants love, however poor he be.  \nThe purse-proud, with a will on harshness bent,  \n  Pays service in the coin of cruelty.1\n\nAnd again:\n\nA bullock greedy for a feast of corn  \n  You never can prevent;  \nA wife who wants her lord to wear a horn  \n  You never can prevent;  \nA man who loves to gamble night and morn  \n  You never can prevent;  \nAnd blemishes 1 that with a man are born  \n  You never can prevent.2\n\nIt is some time since Ch\xc4\x81rudatta went to the concert. It is past midnight, and\nstill he does not come. I think I will go into the outer hall and take a nap.\n[ _He does so_.]\n\n\n\n[ _Enter Ch \xc4\x81rudatta and Maitreya_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. How beautifully Rebhila sang! The lute is indeed a pearl, a\npearl not of the ocean.\n\nGently the anxious lover\'s heart befriending,  \n  Consoling when true lovers may not meet,  \nTo love-lorn souls the dearest comforts sending,  \n  It adds to sweetest love its more of sweet.3\n\n_Maitreya_. Well then, let\'s go into the house.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. But how wonderfully Master Rebhila sang!\n\np. 44\n\n_Maitreya_. There are just two things that always make me laugh. One is a\nwoman talking Sanskrit, and the other is a man who tries to sing soft and low.\nNow when a woman talks Sanskrit, she is like a heifer with a new rope through\nher nose; all you hear is "soo, soo, soo." And when a man tries to sing soft\nand low, he reminds me of an old priest muttering texts, while the flowers in\nhis chaplet dry up. No, I don\'t like it!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. My friend, Master Rebhila sang most wonderfully this evening.\nAnd still you are not satisfied.\n\nThe notes of love, peace, sweetness, could I trace,  \n  The note that thrills, the note of passion too,  \nThe note of woman\'s loveliness and grace\xc2\x97  \n  Ah, my poor words add nothing, nothing new!  \nBut as the notes in sweetest cadence rang,  \nI thought it was my hidden love who sang.4\n\nThe melody of song, the stricken strings  \nIn undertone that half-unconscious clings,  \nMore clearly sounding when the passions rise,  \nBut ever sweeter as the music dies.  \nWords that strong passion fain would say again,  \nYet checks their second utterance\xc2\x97in vain;  \nFor music sweet as this lives on, until  \nI walk as hearing sweetest music still.5\n\n_Maitreya_. But see, my friend! The very dogs are sound asleep in the shops\nthat look out on the market. Let us go home. [ _He looks before him_.] Look,\nlook! The blessed moon seems to give place to darkness, as she descends from\nher palace in heaven.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. True.\n\nThe moon gives place to darkness as she dips  \nBehind the western mountain; and the tips  \nOf her uplifted horns alone appear,  \nLike two sharp-pointed tusks uplifted clear, p. 45  \nWhere bathes an elephant in waters cool,  \nWho shows naught else above the jungle pool.6\n\n_Maitreya_. Well, here is our house. Vardham\xc4\x81naka, Vardham\xc4\x81naka, open the\ndoor!\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. I hear Maitreya\'s voice. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta has returned. I must open\nthe door for him. [ _He does so_.] Master, I salute you. Maitreya, I salute\nyou too. The couch is ready. Pray be seated.\n\n[ _Ch \xc4\x81rudatta and Maitreya enter and seat themselves_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Vardham\xc4\x81naka, call Radanik\xc4\x81 to wash our feet.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Compassionately_.] She sleeps. Do not wake her.\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. I will bring the water, Maitreya, and you may wash\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta\'s feet.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Angrily_.] Look, man. He acts like the son of a slave that he\nis, for he is bringing water. But he makes me wash your feet, and I am a\nBrahman.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Good Maitreya, do you bring the water, and Vardham\xc4\x81naka shall\nwash my feet.\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. Yes, Maitreya. Do you bring the water. [ _Maitreya does so.\nVardham \xc4\x81naka washes Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s feet, then moves away_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Let water be brought for the Brahman\'s feet.\n\n_Maitreya_. What good does water do my feet? I shall have to roll in the dirt\nagain, like a beaten ass.\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. Maitreya, you are a Brahman.\n\n_Maitreya_. Yes, like a slow-worm among all the other snakes, so am I a\nBrahman among all the other Brahmans.\n\n_Vardham \xc4\x81naka_. Maitreya, I will wash your feet after all. [ _He does so_.]\nMaitreya, this golden casket I was to keep by day, you by night. Take it.\n\n[ _He gives it to Maitreya, then exit_.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Receiving the casket_.] The thing is here still. Isn\'t there a\nsingle thief in Ujjayin\xc4\xab to steal the wretch that robs me of my sleep? Listen.\nI am going to take it into the inner court.\n\np. 46\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_. Such lax attention we can ill afford.\n\n  If we are trusted by a courtezan,  \n  Then, Brahman, prove yourself an honest man,  \nAnd guard it safely, till it be restored.7\n\n[ _He nods, repeating the stanza_ "The melody of song, the stricken strings:"\n_page_ 44.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Are you going to sleep?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Yes, so it seems.\n\nFor conquering sleep, descending on mine eyes,  \n  First smites the brow with unresisted blow;  \nUnseen, elusive, like old age, she tries  \n  To gather strength by weakening her foe.8\n\n_Maitreya_. Then let\'s go to sleep. [ _He does so_.]\n\n\n\n[ _Enter Sharvilaka_. 1]\n\n_Sharv_. I made an entrance for my body\'s round\n\n  By force of art and arms, a path to deeds!  \nI skinned my sides by crawling on the ground,  \nLike a snake that sloughs the skin no longer sound;  \n  And now I go where my profession leads.9\n\n[ _He gazes at the sky. Joyfully_.] See! The blessed moon is setting. For well\nI know,\n\nMy trade would fain from watchmen\'s eyes be shrouded;  \n  Valiant, I force the dwelling of another.  \nBut see, the stars in deepest dark are clouded,  \n  And the night shields me like a careful mother.10\n\nI made a breach in the orchard wall and entered. And now I must force my way\ninto the inner court as well.\n\nYes, let men call it vulgar, if they will,  \n  The trade that thrives while sleeps the sleepyhead;  \nYes, knavery, not bravery, call it still,  \n  To overreach confiding folk a-bed. p. 47  \nFar better blame and hissing, fairly won,  \n  Than the pay of genuflecting underlings;  \nThis antique path was trod by Drona\'s son,  \n  Who slew the sleeping, unsuspecting kings.11\n\nBut where shall I make the breach?\n\nWhere is the spot which falling drops decayed?  \n  For each betraying sound is deadened there.  \nNo yawning breach should in the walls be made,  \n  So treatises on robbery declare.  \nWhere does the palace crumble? Where the place  \n  That niter-eaten bricks false soundness wear?  \nWhere shall I \xc2\x92scape the sight of woman\'s face?  \n  Fulfilment of my wishes waits me there.12\n\n[ _He feels the wall_.] Here is a spot weakened by constant sun and sprinkling\nand eaten by saltpeter rot. And here is a pile of dirt thrown up by a mouse.\nNow heaven be praised! My venture prospers. This is the first sign of success\nfor Skanda\'s 1 sons. Now first of all, how shall I make the breach? The\nblessed Bearer of the Golden Lance 2 has prescribed four varieties of breach,\nthus: if the bricks are baked, pull them out; if they are unbaked, cut them;\nif they are made of earth, wet them; if they are made of wood, split them.\nHere we have baked bricks; ergo, pull out the bricks.\n\nNow what shall be the shape I give the breach?  \nA "lotus," "cistern," "crescent moon," or "sun"?  \n"Oblong," or "cross," or "bulging pot"? for each  \nThe treatises permit. Which one? which one?  \nAnd where shall I display my sovereign skill,  \nThat in the morning men may wonder still?13\n\nIn this wall of baked bricks, the "bulging pot" would be effective. I will\nmake that.\n\np. 48\n\nAt other walls that I have pierced by night,  \n  And at my less successful ventures too,  \nThe crowd of neighbors gazed by morning light,  \n  Assigning praise or blame, as was my due.14\n\nPraise to the boon-conferring god, to Skanda of immortal youth! Praise to him,\nthe Bearer of the Golden Lance, the Brahman\'s god, the pious! Praise to him,\nthe Child of the Sun! Praise to him, the teacher of magic, whose first pupil I\nam! For he found plea- sure in me and gave me magic ointment,\n\nWith which so I anointed be,  \nNo watchman\'s eye my form shall see;  \nAnd edged sword that falls on me  \nFrom cruel wounds shall leave me free.15\n\n[ _He anoints himself_.] Alas, I have forgotten my measuring line. [\n_Reflecting_.] Aha! This sacred cord 1 shall be my measuring line. Yes, the\nsacred cord is a great blessing to a Brahman, especially to one like me. For,\nyou see,\n\nWith this he measures, ere he pierce a wall,  \n  And picks the lock, when jewels are at stake.  \nIt serves as key to bolted door and hall,  \n  As tourniquet for bite of worm and snake.16\n\nThe measuring is done. I begin my task. [ _He does so, then takes a look_.] My\nbreach lacks but a single brick. Alas, I am bitten by a snake. [ _He binds his\nfinger with the sacred cord, and manifests the workings of poison_.] I have\napplied the remedy, and now I am restored. [ _He continues his work, then\ngazes_.] Ah, there burns a candle. See!\n\nThough jealous darkness hems it round,  \n  The golden-yellow candle from its place  \nShines through the breach upon the ground,  \n  Like a streak of gold upon the touchstone\'s face.17\n\np. 49\n\n[ _He returns to his work_.] The breach is finished. Good! I enter. But no, I\nwill not enter yet. I will shove a dummy in. [ _He does so_.] Ah, no one is\nthere. Praise be to Skanda! [ _He enters and looks about_.] See! Two men\nasleep. Come, for my own protection I will open the door. But the house is old\nand the door squeaks. I must look for water. Now where might water be? [ _He\nlooks about, finds water, and sprinkles the door. Anxiously_.] I hope it will\nnot fall upon the floor and make a noise. Come, this is the way. [ _He puts\nhis back against the door and opens it cautiously_.] Good! So much for that.\nNow I must discover whether these two are feigning sleep, or whether they are\nasleep in the fullest meaning of the term. [ _He tries to terrify them, and\nnotes the effect_.] Yes, they must be asleep in the fullest meaning of the\nterm. For see!\n\nTheir breath first calmly rises, ere it sink;  \n  Its regularity all fear defies.  \n  Unmoving in their socket-holes, the eyes  \nAre tightly closed, and never seem to wink.  \nThe limbs relaxed, at ease the bodies lie,  \n  I see their feet beyond the bedstead peep,  \nThe lighted candle vexes not the eye;  \n  It would, if they were only feigning sleep.18\n\n[ _He looks about him_.] What! a drum? And here is a flute. And here, a snare-\ndrum. And here, a lute. And reed-pipes. And yonder, manuscripts. Is this the\nhouse of a dancing-master? But no! When I entered, I was convinced that this\nwas a palatial residence. Now then, is this man poor in the fullest meaning of\nthe term, or, from fear of the king or of thieves, does he keep his property\nburied? Well, my own property is buried, too. But I will scatter the seeds\nthat betray subterranean gold. [ _He does so_.] The scattered seeds nowhere\nswell up. Ah, he is poor in the fullest meaning of the term. Good! I go.\n\nMaitreya. [ _Talking in his sleep_.] Look, man. I see something like\n\np. 50\n\na hole in the wall. I see something like a thief. You had better take this\ngolden casket.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. I wonder if the man has discovered that I have entered, and is\nshowing off his poverty in order to make fun of me. Shall I kill him, or is\nthe poor devil talking in his sleep? [ _He takes a look_.] But see! This thing\nwrapped in a ragged bath-clout, now that I inspect it by the light of my\ncandle, is in truth a jewel-casket. Suppose I take it. But no! It is hardly\nproper to rob a man of good birth, who is as poor as I am. I go.\n\n_Maitreya_. My friend, by the wishes of cows and Brahmans 1 I conjure you to\ntake this golden casket.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. One may not disregard the sacred wish of a cow and the wish of a\nBrahman. I will take it. But look! There burns the candle. I keep about me a\nmoth for the express purpose of extinguishing candles. I will let him enter\nthe flame. This is his place and hour. May this moth which I here release,\ndepart to flutter above the flame in varying circles. The breeze from the\ninsect\'s wings has translated the flame into accursed darkness. Or shall I not\nrather curse the darkness brought by me upon my Brahmanic family? For my\nfather was a man who knew the four Vedas, who would not accept a gift; and I,\nSharvilaka, his son, and a Brahman, I am committing a crime for the sake of\nthat courtezan girl Madanik\xc4\x81. Now I will grant the Brahman\'s wish. [ _He\nreaches out for the casket_.]\n\nMaitreya. How cold your fingers are, man!\n\n_Sharvilaka_. What carelessness! My fingers are cold from touching water.\nWell, I will put my hand in my armpit. [ _He warms his left hand and takes the\ncasket_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Have you got it?\n\n_Sharvilaka_. I could not refuse a Brahman\'s request. I have it.\n\np. 51\n\n_Maitreya_. Now I shall sleep as peacefully as a merchant who has sold his\nwares.\n\n_Sharvilaka_. O great Brahman, sleep a hundred years! Alas that a Brahman\nfamily should thus be plunged in darkness for the sake of Madanik\xc4\x81, a\ncourtezan! Or better, I myself am thus plunged in darkness.\n\nA curse on poverty, I say!  \n  \xc2\x92Tis stranger to the manly will;  \nThis act that shuns the light of day  \n  I curse indeed, but do it still.19\n\nWell then, I must go to Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s house to buy Madanik\xc4\x81\'s freedom. [ _He\nwalks about and looks around him_.] Ah, I think I hear footsteps. I hope they\nare not those of policemen. Never mind. I will pretend to be a pillar, and\nwait. But after all, do policemen exist for me, for Sharvilaka? Why, I am\n\nA cat for crawling, and a deer for flight,  \nA hawk for rending, and a dog for sight  \nTo judge the strength of men that wake or sleep,  \nA snake, when \xc2\x92tis advisable to creep,  \nIllusion\'s self, to seem a saint or rogue,  \nGoddess of Speech in understanding brogue;  \nA light in blackest night, in holes a lizard I can be,  \nA horse on terra firma, and a ship upon the sea.20\n\nAnd again:\n\nQuick as a snake, and steady as a hill;  \nIn flight the prince of birds can show no greater skill;  \nIn searching on the ground I am as keen as any hare,  \nIn strength I am a lion, and a wolf to rend and tear.21\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Entering_.] Dear me! Vardham\xc4\x81naka went to sleep in the outer\ncourt, and now he is not there. Well, I will call Maitreya. [ _She walks\nabout_.]\n\np. 52\n\n_Sharvilaka_. [ _Prepares to strike down Radanik \xc4\x81, but first takes a look_.]\nWhat! a woman? Good! I go.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. [ _Recoiling in terror_.] Oh, oh, a thief has cut a hole in the\nwall of our house and is escaping. I must go and wake Maitreya. [ _She\napproaches Maitreya_.] Oh, Maitreya, get up, get up! A thief has cut a hole in\nthe wall of our house and has escaped.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Rising_.] What do you mean, wench? "A hole in the wall has cut\na thief and has escaped"?\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. Poor fool! Stop your joking. Don\'t you see it?\n\n_Maitreya_. What do you mean, wench? "It looks as if a second door had been\nthrown open"? Get up, friend Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, get up! A thief has made a hole in\nthe wall of our house and has escaped.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Yes, yes! A truce to your jests!\n\n_Maitreya_. But it isn\'t a jest. Look!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Where?\n\n_Maitreya_. Why, here.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Gazing_.] What a very remarkable hole!\n\nThe bricks are drawn away below, above;  \n  The top is narrow, but the center wide;  \n  As if the great house-heart had burst with pride,  \nFearing lest the unworthy share its love.22\n\nTo think that science should be expended on a task like this!\n\n_Maitreya_. My friend, this hole must have been made by one of two men; either\nby a stranger, or else for practice by a student of the science of robbery.\nFor what man here in Ujjayin\xc4\xab does not know how much wealth there is in our\nhouse?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rud_. Stranger he must have been who made the breach,\n\n  His customed harvest in my house to reap;  \nHe has not learned that vanished riches teach  \n  A calm, untroubled sleep. p. 53  \nHe saw the sometime greatness of my home  \n  And forced an entrance; for his heart did leap  \nWith short-lived hope; now he must elsewhere roam,  \n  And over broken hopes must sorely weep.23\n\nJust think of the poor fellow telling his friends: "I entered the house of a\nmerchant\'s son, and found\xc2\x97nothing."\n\n_Maitreya_. Do you mean to say that you pity the rascally robber? Thinks\nhe\xc2\x97"Here\'s a great house. Here\'s the place to carry off a jewel-casket or a\ngold-casket." [ _He remembers the casket. Despondently. Aside_.] Where is that\ngolden casket? [ _He remembers the events of the night. Aloud_.] Look, man!\nYou are always saying "Maitreya is a fool, Maitreya is no scholar." But I\ncertainly acted wisely in handing over that golden casket to you. If I hadn\'t,\nthe son of a slave would have carried it off.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. A truce to your jests!\n\n_Maitreya_. Just because I\'m a fool, do you suppose I don\'t even know the\nplace and time for a jest?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. But when did this happen?\n\n_Maitreya_. Why, when I told you that your fingers were cold.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. It might have been. [ _He searches about. Joyfully_.] My\nfriend, I have something pleasant to tell you.\n\n_Maitreya_. What? Wasn\'t it stolen?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Yes.\n\n_Maitreya_. What is the pleasant news, then?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. The fact that he did not go away disappointed.\n\n_Maitreya_. But it was only entrusted to our care.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. What! entrusted to our care? [ _He swoons_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Come to yourself, man. Is the fact that a thief stole what was\nentrusted to you, any reason why you should swoon?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Coming to himself_.] Ah, my friend,\n\np. 54\n\nWho will believe the truth?  \n  Suspicion now is sure.  \nThis world will show no ruth  \n  To the inglorious poor.24\n\nAlas!\n\nIf envious fate before  \n  Has wooed my wealth alone,  \nWhy should she seek my store  \n  Of virtue as her own?25\n\n_Maitreya_. I intend to deny the whole thing. Who gave anybody anything? who\nreceived anything from anybody? who was a witness?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. And shall I tell a falsehood now?\n\nNo! I will beg until I earn  \n  The wherewithal my debt to pay.  \nIgnoble falsehood I will spurn,  \n  That steals the character away.26\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. I will go and tell his good wife. [ _She goes out, returning with\nCh \xc4\x81rudatta\'s wife_.]\n\n_Wife_. [ _Anxiously_.] Oh! Is it true that my lord is uninjured, and Maitreya\ntoo?\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. It is true, mistress. But the gems which belong to the courtezan\nhave been stolen. [ _Ch \xc4\x81rudatta\'s wife swoons_.] O my good mistress! Come to\nyourself!\n\n_Wife_. [ _Recovering_.] Girl, how can you say that my lord is uninjured?\nBetter that he were injured in body than in character. For now the people of\nUjjayin\xc4\xab will say that my lord committed this crime because of his poverty. [\n_She looks up and sighs_.] Ah, mighty Fate! The destinies of the poor,\nuncertain as the water-drops which fall upon a lotus-leaf, seem to thee but\nplaythings. There remains to me this one necklace, which I brought with me\nfrom my mother\'s house. But my lord would be too proud to accept it. Girl,\ncall Maitreya hither.\n\np. 55\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. Yes, mistress. [ _She approaches Maitreya_.] Maitreya, my lady\nsummons you.\n\n_Maitreya_. Where is she?\n\n_Radanik \xc4\x81_. Here. Come!\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Approaching_.] Heaven bless you!\n\n_Wife_. I salute you, sir. Sir, will you look straight in front of you?\n\n_Maitreya_. Madam, here stands a man who looks straight in front of him.\n\n_Wife_. Sir, you must accept this.\n\n_Maitreya_. Why?\n\n_Wife_. I have observed the Ceremony of the Gems. And on this occasion one\nmust make as great a present as one may to a Brahman. This I have not done,\ntherefore pray accept this necklace.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Receiving the necklace_.] Heaven bless you! I will go and tell\nmy friend.\n\n_Wife_. You must not do it in such a way as to make me blush,\n\n_Maitreya_.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _In astonishment_.] What generosity!\n\n\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. How Maitreya lingers! I trust his grief is not leading him to\ndo what he ought not. Maitreya, Maitreya!\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Approaching_.] Here I am. Take that. [ _He displays the\nnecklace_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. What is this?\n\n_Maitreya_. Why, that is the reward you get for marrying such a wife.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. What! my wife takes pity on me? Alas, now am I poor indeed!\n\nWhen fate so robs him of his all,  \nThat on her pity he must call,  \nThe man to woman\'s state doth fall,  \n  The woman is the man.27\n\np. 56\n\nBut no, I am not poor. For I have a wife\n\nWhose love outlasts my wealthy day;  \n  In thee a friend through good and ill;  \nAnd truth that naught could take away:  \n  Ah, this the poor man lacketh still.28\n\n_Maitreya_ , take the necklace and go to Vasantasen\xc4\x81. Tell her in my name that\nwe have gambled away the golden casket, forgetting that it was not our own;\nthat we trust she will accept this necklace in its place.\n\n_Maitreya_. But you must not give away this necklace, the pride of the four\nseas, for that cheap thing that was stolen before we had a bite or a drink out\nof it.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Not so, my friend.\n\nShe showed her trust in leaving us her treasure;  \nThe price of confidence has no less measure.29\n\nFriend, I conjure you by this gesture, not to return until you have delivered\nit into her hands. Vardham\xc4\x81naka, do you speedily\n\nFill up the opening with the selfsame bricks;  \n  Thus will I thwart the process of the law,  \nFor the blemish of so great a scandal sticks.30\n\nAnd, friend Maitreya, you must show your pride by not speaking too\ndespondently.\n\n_Maitreya_. How can a poor man help speaking despondently?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Poor I am not, my friend. For I have a wife\n\nWhose love outlasts my wealthy day;  \n  In thee a friend through good and ill;  \nAnd truth that naught could take away:  \n  Ah, this the poor man lacketh still. (28)\n\nGo then, and after performing rites of purification, I will offer my morning\nprayer.\n\n[ _Exeunt omnes_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[43:1](lcc09.htm#fr_43) This refers to Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s generosity, which\ncontinues after his wealth has vanished.\n\n[46:1](lcc09.htm#fr_44) The following scene satirizes the Hindu love of system\nand classification.\n\n[47:1](lcc09.htm#fr_45) The patron saint of thieves.\n\n[47:2](lcc09.htm#fr_46) An epithet of Skanda.\n\n[48:1](lcc09.htm#fr_47) The sacrificial cord, which passes over the left\nshoulder and under the right arm, is worn constantly by members of the three\nupper castes.\n\n[50:1](lcc09.htm#fr_48) Sacred creatures.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act the Fourth: Madanik\xc4\x81 and Sharvilaka](lcc10.htm)\n\n'
