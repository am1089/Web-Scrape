(Nor shall he study) on the days of the full moons of those months in\nwhich the Katurmasya-sacrifice may be performed (nor on the days preceding\nthem). 1\n\n2\\. At the time of the Vedotsarga, on the death of Gurus, at the Ashlaka- _S_\nraddha, and at the time of the Upakarma, (he shall not study) for three days;\n2\n\n3\\. Likewise if near relations have died. 3\n\n4\\. (He shall not study) for twelve days, if his mother, father, or teacher\nhave died.\n\n5\\. If these (have died), he must (also) bathe for the same number of days.\n\n6\\. Persons who are younger (than the relation deceased), must shave (their\nhair and beard), 6\n\np. 37\n\n7\\. Some declare, that students who have returned home on completion of their\nstudentship, shall never shave, except if engaged in the initiation to a _S_\nrauta-sacrifice. 7\n\n8\\. Now a Brahma _n_ a also declares, \'Verily, an empty, uncovered (pot) is\nhe, whose hair is shaved off entirely; the top-lock is his covering.\' 8\n\n9\\. But at sacrificial sessions the top-lock must be shaved off, because it is\nso enjoined in the Veda. 9\n\n10\\. Some declare, that, upon the death of the teacher, (the reading should be\ninterrupted) for three days and three nights. 10\n\n11\\. If (he hears of) the death of a learned Brahma _n_ a ( _S_ rotriya)\nbefore a full year (since the death) has elapsed, (he shall interrupt his\nreading) for one night (and day). 11\n\n12\\. Some declare, (that the deceased _S_ rotriya must have been) a fellow-\nstudent.\n\n13-14. If a learned Brahma _n_ a ( _S_ rotriya) has arrived and he is desirous\nof studying or is actually studying, (or if he is desirous of teaching or is\nteaching,)\n\np. 38\n\nhe may study or teach after having received permission (to do so from the _S_\nrotriya).\n\n15-16. He may likewise study or teach in the presence of his teacher, if (the\nlatter) has addressed him (saying), \'Ho, study! (or, Ho, teach!)\' 15\n\n17\\. When a student desires to study or has finished his lesson, he shall at\nboth occasions embrace the feet of his teacher. 17\n\n18\\. Or if, whilst they study, another person comes in, he shall continue his\nrecitation, after those words, (\'Ho, study!\') have been pronounced (by the\nnewcomer). 18\n\n19\\. The barking of (many) dogs, the braying of (many) asses, the cry of a\nwolf or of a solitary jackal or of an owl, all sounds of musical instruments,\nof weeping, and of the Saman melodies (are reasons for discontinuing the study\nof the Veda). 19\n\n20\\. If another branch of the Veda (is being recited in the neighbourhood),\nthe Saman melodies shall not be studied.\n\n21\\. And whilst other noises (are being heard, the recitation of the Veda\nshall be discontinued), if they mix (with the voice of the person studying).\n21\n\np. 39\n\n22\\. After having vomited (he shall not study) until he has slept. 22\n\n23\\. Or (he may study) having eaten clarified butter (after the attack of\nvomiting).\n\n24\\. A foul smell (is a reason for the discontinuance of study). 24\n\n25\\. Food turned sour (by fermentation), which he has in his stomach, (is a\nreason for the discontinuance of the recitation, until the sour rising\nceases). 25\n\n26\\. (Nor shall he study) after having eaten in the evening, 26\n\n27\\. Nor as long as his hands are wet. 27\n\n28\\. (And he shall discontinue studying) for, a day and an evening, after\nhaving eaten food prepared in honour of a dead person (for whom the Sapi _n_\n_d_ i-kara _n_ a has not yet been performed), 28\n\n29\\. Or until the food (eaten on that occasion) is digested. 29\n\n30\\. But he shall (always) eat in addition (to the meal given in honour of a\ndead person), food which has not been given at a sacrifice to the Manes. 30\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[36:1](sbe0213.htm#fr_259) **10**. The three full-moon days are Phalguni\n(February-March), \xc3\x82shadhi (June-July), Karttiki (October-November).\n\n[36:2](sbe0213.htm#fr_260) The construction is very irregular, the first noun\nstanding in the nominative and the rest in the locative. A similar\nirregularity occurs below, I, 3, 11, 3 1. The Vedotsarga is the ceremony.\nwhich is performed at the end of the Brahmanic term, in January. \'In the case\nof the death of a Guru, the vacation begins with the day on which the death\noccurs. On the other occasions mentioned he shall not study on the day\npreceding (the ceremony), on the day (of the ceremony), nor on the day\nfollowing it.\'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 119; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 144. \'The Gurus\'\nintended here, are fathers-in-law, uncles, &c.\n\n[36:3](sbe0213.htm#fr_261) \'This rule applies to a student only. It is known\nfrom another work that those who have been infected by impurity (on the death\nof a relation), must not study whilst the impurity lasts. \'Haradatta. Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_. I, 144.\n\n[36:6](sbe0213.htm#fr_262) The word anubhavinah, interpreted by Haradatta as\n\'persons who are younger than the deceased,\' is explained in different ways by\nothers; firstly, as \'the mourners,\' and secondly, as \'Samanodakas or gentiles\nbeyond the sixth degree.\' In the latter case the Sutra ought to be-translated\nthus: \'On the death of gentiles beyond the sixth degree, (the head) ought to\nbe shaved.\'\n\n[37:7](sbe0213.htm#fr_263) Regarding the Diksha initiation,\' see Aitareya-\nbrahma _n_ a I, 1, and Max Muller\'s History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p.\n309 seq.\n\n[37:8](sbe0213.htm#fr_264) Hence it follows that the top-lock should not be\nshaved off, except in the case mentioned in the following Sutra.\n\n[37:9](sbe0213.htm#fr_265) Sattras, \'sacrificial sessions,\' are sacrifices\nwhich last longer than twelve days.\n\n[37:10](sbe0213.htm#fr_266) \'But in his opinion it should be twelve days, as\ndeclared above, Sutra 4.\'--Haradatta. It appears, therefore, that this Sutra\nis to be connected with Sutra 4.\n\n[37:11](sbe0213.htm#fr_267) \'Because the word "death "is used here, death only\nis the reason (for stopping, the reading), in the case of Gurus and the rest\n(i.e. the word "died" must be understood in Sutra 2 and the following ones).\'\n--Haradatta.\n\n[38:15](sbe0213.htm#fr_268)-16. Manu II, 73.\n\n[38:17](sbe0213.htm#fr_269) Manu II, 73.\n\n[38:18](sbe0213.htm#fr_270) Haradatta states rightly, that the plural (\'they\nstudy\') is useless. According to him, the use of the verb in the singular may\nbe excused thereby, that the advice is addressed to each of the persons\nengaged in study. Manu IV, 122.\n\n[38:19](sbe0213.htm#fr_271) The ekas _ri_ ka, \'solitary jackal,\' is now called\nBalu or Pheough, and is considered to be the constant companion of a tiger or\npanther. Its unharmonious cry is, in the present day also, considered to be an\nevil omen. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 148; Manu IV, 108, 115 and 123.\n\n[38:21](sbe0213.htm#fr_272) Manu IV, 121.\n\n[39:22](sbe0213.htm#fr_273) Manu IV, 121.\n\n[39:24](sbe0213.htm#fr_274) Manu IV, 107; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 150.\n\n[39:25](sbe0213.htm#fr_275) Manu IV, 121.\n\n[39:26](sbe0213.htm#fr_276) \'Therefore he shall sup, after having finished his\nstudy.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[39:27](sbe0213.htm#fr_277) Manu IV, 121; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 149.\n\n[39:28](sbe0213.htm#fr_278) Manu IV, 112; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 146.\n\n[39:29](sbe0213.htm#fr_279) If that food has not been digested by the end of\nthat time (i.e. in the evening), he shall not study until it has been\ndigested.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[39:30](sbe0213.htm#fr_280) \'Because in this Sutra the expression "food not\ngiven at a _S_ raddha" occurs, some think that the preceding Sutra refers to\n"food eaten at a _S_ raddha."\'--Haradatta. This explanation is not at all\nimprobable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 3, Kha _n_ _d_ a 11](sbe0214.htm)\n\n'
