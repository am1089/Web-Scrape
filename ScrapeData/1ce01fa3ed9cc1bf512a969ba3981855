But (there are also, in addition to the seven pra _n_ as mentioned,) the\nhands and so on. This being a settled matter, therefore (we must) not\n(conclude) thus (viz. that there are seven pra _n_ as only).\n\nIn addition to the seven pra _n_ as scripture mentions other pra _n_ as also,\nsuch as the hands, &c., 'The hand is one graha and that is seized by work as\nthe atigraha; for with the hands one does work' (B _ri_. Up. III, 2, 8), and\nsimilar passages. And as it is settled that there are more than seven, the\nnumber seven may be explained as being contained within the greater number.\nFor wherever there is a conflict between a higher and a lower number, the\nhigher number has to be accepted because the lower one is contained within it;\nwhile the higher is not contained within the lower. We therefore must not\nconclude that, in deference to the lower\n\np. 81\n\nnumber, seven pra _n_ as have to be assumed, but rather that there are eleven\npra _n_ as, in deference to the higher number. This conclusion is confirmed by\none of the passages quoted, 'Ten are these pra _n_ as in man, and \xc3\x82tman is the\neleventh.' By the word \xc3\x82tman we have to understand the internal organ, on\naccount of its ruling over the organs. Should it be objected that scripture\nalso mentions numbers higher than eleven, viz. twelve and thirteen, we admit\nthat, but remark that there are no objective effects in addition to the eleven\n(well-known) objective effects on account of which additional organs would\nhave to be assumed. There are five distinctions of buddhi having for their\nrespective objects sound, touch, colour, taste, and smell, and on their\naccount there are the five intellectual organs; again there are five classes\nof action, viz. speaking, taking, going, evacuation, and begetting, and on\ntheir account there are the five organs of action; finally there is the manas\nwhich has all things for its objects and extends to the past, the present, and\nthe future; it is one only but has various functions. On account of the\nplurality of its functions we find it designated by different terms in\ndifferent places, as manas or buddhi or aha _m_ kara or _k_ itta. Thus\nscripture also after having enumerated the various functions such as desire,\n&c., says at the end, 'All this is manas only.'--That passage again which\nspeaks of the pra _n_ as of the head as seven means four pra _n_ as only,\nwhich on account of the plurality of their places may be counted as seven;\nviz. the two ears, the two eyes, the two nostrils, and speech.--Nor can it be\nmaintained that there are in reality only so many (i.e. seven), the other pra\n_n_ as being mere functions of the seven; for the functions of the hands and\nso on are absolutely different (from the functions of the seven senses\nadmitted by the purvapakshin).--Again, in the passage 'Nine pra _n_ as indeed\nare in man, the navel is the tenth,' the expression 'ten pra _n_ as' is used\nto denote the different openings of the human body, not the difference of\nnature of the pra _n_ as, as we conclude from the navel being mentioned as the\neleventh. For no pra _n_ a is known that bears the name of navel; but the\nnavel as being one of the special abodes of the chief pra _n_ a is here\nenumerated\n\np. 82\n\nas a tenth pra _n_ a.--In some places so and so many are counted for the\npurpose of meditation; in other places so and so many for the purpose of\nillustration 1. As the statements concerning the number of the pra _n_ as are\nof so varying a nature we must therefore distinguish in each case what the\nobject of the statement is. Meanwhile it remains a settled conclusion that\nthat statement which makes the pra _n_ as to be eleven is authoritative, on\naccount of the objective effects (being eleven also).\n\nThe two Sutras (referring to the number of the pra _n_ as) may be construed in\nthe following manner also. The pra _n_ as are seven because scripture mentions\nthe going (gati) of seven only, 'When he thus departs life departs after him,\nand when life thus departs all the other pra _n_ as 2 depart after it' (B\n_ri_. Up. IV, 4, 2).--But, it may be objected, this passage says 'all the\nother pra _n_ as;' how then does it declare the going of seven only?--The\nSutra replies, 'on account of their being specified.' Seven senses only, from\nseeing up to feeling, are specified there because so many only are under\ndiscussion; as we see from the enumeration given in the passage, 'When that\nperson in the eye turns away then he ceases to know any forms. He has become\none they say. he does not see' &c. The word 'all' refers here only to what is\nunder discussion, i.e. only to the seven pra _n_ as mentioned before, not to\nany other. Analogously when we say 'all the Brahma _n_ as have been fed,' we\nmean only those Brahma _n_ as who have been invited and concern us at the\ntime, not any other.--If it be objected that the passage quoted mentions\nunderstanding (vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana) as the eighth thing departing, and that we\ntherefore have no right to speak of the departing of seven only, we reply that\nmanas and understanding differ not in essential nature but only in function,\nand that on this account we are entitled to speak of seven pra _n_ as only.--\nThe answer to this\n\np. 83\n\npurvapaksha is as follows.--In addition to the seven senses, other pra _n_ as\nalso, such as the hands, are known to exist, as we see from such passages as\n'The hands are one graha,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. III, 2, 8). By their being a graha\n(seizer) is meant that they are bonds by which the individual soul (kshetra\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) is tied. Now the individual soul is tied not in one body only, but\nis equally tied in other bodies also. Hence it follows that that bond called\ngraha (i.e. among other things the hands) moves over into other bodies also.\nSm _ri_ ti also ('He--the Self--is joined with the aggregate of eight,\ncomprising breath, &c. 1, as his mark; his bondage consists in being bound by\nit, his release in being freed from it') shows that the Self is, previous to\nfinal release, not freed from the bonds called grahas. And also in the\nenumeration of the senses and their objects given by the Atharva _n_ a\nUpanishad ('The eye and what can be seen,' &c., Pr. Up. IV, 8), the organs of\naction such as the hands and so on, together with their objects, are specified\nas well, 'the hands and what can be grasped; the member and what can be\ndelighted; the anus and what can be evacuated; the feet and what can be\nwalked.' Moreover the passage, 'These ten vital breaths and atman as the\neleventh; when they depart from this mortal body they make us cry' (B _ri_.\nUp. III, 9, 4), shows that eleven pra _n_ as depart from the body.--Moreover\nthe word 'all' (which occurs in the passage. B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 2) must,\nbecause connected with the word 'pra _n_ as,' denote all pra _n_ as, and\ncannot, on the ground of general subject-matter, be limited to the seven pra\n_n_ as; for a direct statement has greater force than the subject-matter. Even\nin the analogous sentence, 'all Brahma _n_ as have been fed,' we have, on the\nground of the words, to understand all Brahma _n_ as living on the earth; but\nbecause it is impossible to feed all Brahma _n_ as in the latter sense, we\naccept that meaning of\n\np. 84\n\n[paragraph continues] 'all,' according to which it denotes all invited Brahma\n_n_ as. In our case on the other hand there is no reason whatever for\nnarrowing the meaning of 'all.'--Hence the word 'all' includes all pra _n_ as\nwithout exception. Nothing on the other hand prevents the enumeration of seven\npra _n_ as being taken as illustrative only. It is therefore an established\nconclusion, resting on the number of the effects as well as on Vedic\nstatement, that there are eleven pra _n_ as.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[82:1](sbe38060.htm#fr_53) Sapta pra _n_ a _h_ prabhavantity ader gatim aha\nkva _k_ id iti, ash _t_ au graha ityader gati _m_ su _k_ ayati gatim iti \xc3\x82n.\nGi.\n\n[82:2](sbe38060.htm#fr_54) I.e. seeing, smelling, tasting, speaking, hearing,\nfeeling, and the manas.\n\n[83:1](sbe38060.htm#fr_55) The eightfold aggregate of which the Self is freed\nin final release only comprises the five pra _n_ as (vital airs), the pentad\nof the five subtle elements, the pentad of the organs of intellect, the pentad\nof the organs of action, the tetrad of internal organs (manas, &c.), avidya,\ndesire (kama), and karman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 7](sbe38061.htm)\n\n"
