D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n\xc2\xa7 5\\. Brahma and Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a.--This conception, however it might be disguised in\ncosmogonic and mythopoeic forms, was in essence strictly materialistic. But by\nits side there arose in the schools of the Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as two somewhat different\ncurrents of thought--the doctrines of _Brahma_ and of _Pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. Brahma,_ in the\nearlier Vedic books, is a neuter noun, meaning the spell or prayer of the\npriest and the magic power which it exerts over gods, men, and the universe.\n_Pr \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a,_ again, is properly the breath of the body, hence the incorporeal\nforces or functional energies on which depends the existence of material life.\nThus arose the idea of Force, cosmic power, _Brahma,_ as the ultimate reality\nand origin of phenomenal being, the knowledge of which brought with it the\nknowledge of all the phenomena evolved from it.\n\nOften the Upanishads, especially the older texts, identify Brahma (and the\nindividual Self which is one with Brahma), with the "life-breath" in the\nmicrocosm and its analogue, the wind of the macrocosm. On the supremacy of\n\np. 16\n\nthe breath over the other functions, see B.A. I. v. 14, Ch. I. xi. 5, v. i. 6\nf., VI. vii., VII. xv., Pra. VI. 3 f.; breath or wind the guiding force of\nnature, B.A. I. v. 21 f., III. iii. 2, vii. 2 f.; first principle of nature,\nKau. II. 12 f.\n\nIn the same mythological fashion Brahma is often symbolised by the _manas,_ or\norgan of determinate sense-perception and will (see \xc2\xa7 18), and by the ether,\nthe macrocosmic analogue of the _manas._\n\nThe earlier Upanishads often also speak of the cosmic principle as _Purusha,_\nliterally "man." This term, as we have seen, arises from the Vedic hymn which\nmystically describes the origin of the world from the body of an ideal man\nsacrificed by the gods; hence it often denotes the Demiurge, or first\nprinciple of cosmic life (with a false etymology from _puri- \xc5\x9baya,_ "lying in\nthe city," viz. in the microcosmic and macrocosmic body), and sometimes is\nused loosely for spirit generally.\n\nAs the sun is sometimes mentioned as a symbol of Brahma, so also Brahma is\nsometimes typified macrocosmically by the _purusha_ in the sun and\nmicrocosmically by the _purusha_ in the eye (i.e. the reflected figure in the\npupil).\n\nAnother symbol of Brahma as identified with the individual soul is the bodily\nheat (Ch. III. xiii. 7 f.). In Ch. IV. x.-xv. the sacred fires are identified\nwith Brahma, to which are given the especial attributes of space _(kham)_ and\njoy _(kam)_.
