For him who sits on the Vedi (i. e. on the sacrificial bed), whose\nfoundations are pleasant, for the brilliant Agni bring forward\n[1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:1:1) a receptacle [2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:1:2),\nwhich is to him like a drink. Clothe 1 the bright one in prayer as in a\ngarment, him whose chariot is light, whose colour is bright, the destroyer of\ndarkness.\n\n2\\. He who has a twofold birth [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:2:1), presses on\ntowards the threefold food [2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:2:2); what he has eaten\ngrows again after a year [3](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:2:3). With the mouth and\nthe tongue of the one he (shows himself as) the noble, manly one; with the\nother (mouth) the stubborn (Agni) wipes off the trees\n[4](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:2:4).\n\n3\\. Both his mothers [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:3:1), dwelling together,\nimmersed in darkness, and affrighted, proceed towards the young child who\nstretches forward his tongue, who sparkling moves about thirstily, whom men\nshould attach to themselves, who agitates (the world), the increaser of his\nfather [2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:3:2).\n\n4\\. Thy speedy (teams) [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:4:1) that strive to break\nloose for the benefit of the man who acts as men do, the swift ones, drawing\nblack furrows-thy quick (horses), striving apart, the agile, swift runners,\nincited by the wind, are yoked.\n\n5\\. When he stroking his wide course proceeds panting, thundering, roaring,\nthen those sparkling (rays) of his fly about wildly, displaying wondrous\ndarkness, a large sight [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:5:1).\n\n6\\. When he bends down over the brown (plants) [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:6:1)\nlike a busy (servant), he roars and approaches his\n\np. 142\n\nwives like a bull. Displaying his power he adorns his bodies with beauty; like\na terrible beast, difficult to seize, he shakes his horns.\n\n7\\. He clasps (the plants, &c.) that have been laid together and have been\nlaid out [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:7:1). Knowing them, while they know him,\nand being their own (friend or lover) he lies on them. They grow again and\nattain godhead. They produce together another shape of the parents\n[2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:7:2).\n\n8\\. The long-haired virgins [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:8:1) have embraced him.\nHaving died they stand upright again for him (Agni) the living one (or, for\nhim the \xc3\x82yu). Delivering them of old age he proceeds roaring, procreating\nanother vital spirit, an indestructible life.\n\n9\\. Licking everywhere the upper garment of the mother\n[1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:9:1), he spreads himself over the space with his\nmightily devouring warriors, giving strength to everything that has feet,\nlicking and licking. The reddish white one [2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:9:2)\nfollows her ways [3](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:9:3).\n\n10\\. Shine, O Agni, among our liberal lords, for thou art a mightily breathing\nbull, a friend of the house. Throwing down the (mothers) of the young child\n[1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:10:1) thou hast shone, (a protector of thy friends)\nlike a coat of mail in battles, hurrying around.\n\n11\\. May this well-composed (prayer), O Agni, be more welcome to thee than a\nbadly-composed one--more welcome than even a welcome prayer. With the bright\nlight of thy body win thou treasures for us.\n\n12\\. Grant us, Agni, for our chariot and for our house a ship which has its\nown rudders and which has feet [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:12:1), which may save\nour strong men and our liberal lords and our people, and which may be a\nshelter for us.\n\np. 143\n\n13\\. Approve, O Agni, our hymn alone. May Heaven and Earth and the Rivers,\ndelightful by their own nature [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:13:1), going their\nway [2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:13:2), (choose for us) bliss in cows and crops,\nlong days; may the red (Dawns) choose food for us as a choice boon.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Dirghatamas Au _k_ athya, the metre _G_ agati; the two last\nverses are Trish _t_ ubh (comp. above the note on the metre of I, 94); the\ntenth verse, which is considered as either _G_ agati or Trish _t_ ubh, begins\nwith one _G_ agati Pada which is followed by three Padas in Trish _t_ ubh.--No\nverse occurs in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Pra bhara (Padap. pra bhara) and vasaya (Padap. vasaya) may be 1st\nperson.\n\nNote 2. Possibly the 'womb' or 'receptacle' (yoni) here means gh _ri_ ta or\nthe like, for it is said of Agni that 'his womb is gh _ri_ ta' (II, 3, 11),\nand he is called gh _ri_ tayoni _h_. This receptacle 'is to him like a drink,'\nbecause he consumes the gh _ri_ ta by which he is surrounded.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The terrestrial and the celestial birth. Comp. Bergaigne, I, 28 seq.\n\nNote 2. Bergaigne (I, 29) translates: '\xe2\x80\xa6 s'elance trois fois sur la\nnourriture,' which he explains as referring to 'the three sacrifices of the\nmorning, the midday, and the evening.' But tri-v _r i_t clearly is an epithet\nof annam, not an adverb. The explanation of Saya _n_ a, who understands the\nthreefold food as sacrificial butter, sacrificial cakes (puro _d_ a _s_ a),\nand Soma, may be correct.\n\nNote 3. On the locative sa _m_ vatsare, comp. Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, p.\n117.\n\np. 144\n\nNote 4. The last words evidently refer to Agni's tongue, i. e. his flames,\nwiping off as it were the firewood. But it is not clear what the tongue of the\nother one is. Saya _n_ a thinks of the sacrificial spoon conceived as the\ntongue of the officiating priest: which is very artificial, but perhaps not\ntoo artificial for a verse like this.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The 'two mothers' of Agni may be the two worlds (comp. Bergaigne, I,\n238) or the two kindling-sticks. -Ubha\xc2\xb4 (masc.) instead of ubhe is to be\nremarked.\n\nNote 2. Agni increases the wealth of the worshipper who has lighted the fire\nand may thus be considered as Agni's father. Comp. _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a\nXII, 5, 2, 15. Or the father may be Heaven; on Agni as imparting strength to\nHeaven, see I, 164, 51.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The verse begins with feminines; the _g_ uva _h_ (comp. I, 134, 1),\nliterally the quick ones, seem to be something like the niyuta _h_ of Agni.\nThen follow masculines; the horses of Agni are male (comp. Bergaigne, I, 143).\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Comp. bhu\xc2\xb4ri varpa _h_ karikrat, III, 58, 9.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The brown ones, according to Saya _n_ a, are the plants. They are\ncalled brown (babhru) also in X, 97, 1. 'Are they the dry leaves in which the\nspark is caught?' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Prof. Max Muller translates sa _m_ stira _h_ vish _t_ ira _h_ , '(the\nflames) that are together and apart.'\n\nNote 2. The parents seem to be Heaven and Earth, as Saya _n_ a explains.--\nPossibly pitro _h_ depends on sa _k_ a (comp.\n\np. 145\n\npitro _h_ sa _k_ a, II, 17, 7; IV, 5, 10), being with their parents they\nproduce a new shape.' Prof. Max Muller translates: 'They produce together a\ndifferent shape of their parents.'\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Should not the plants again be referred to? 'I think it refers to the\n_g_ valas, the flames that are hidden under the ashes and are lighted again.'\nM. M.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The mother is the Earth whose surface Agni licks.\n\nNote 2. I believe the Dawn is alluded to whom the Vedic poets represent now as\npreceding Agni, now as following him. See Bergaigne, II, pp. 14, 15.\n\nNote 3. For vartani\xc2\xb4r aha of the Sa _m_ hitapa _th_ a the Padapa _th_ a has\nvartani _h_ aha; comp. Rig-veda Prati _s_ akhya, Sutra 259. Vartani\xc2\xb4 _h_ of\ncourse is correct. Comp. X, 172, I. ga\xc2\xb4va _h_ sa _k_ anta vartanim.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. The mothers of the young child are very probably the mothers of Agni\nrepresented as a young child. They may be the Waters which Agni leaves resting\non the surface of the earth while he himself rises to heaven. Or the mothers\nmay be the woods or plants which he burns and thus throws them down as it\nwere.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. 'Which has feet in its own rudders,' M. M. That the ship has feet\nseems to mean only that it has the faculty of moving forward freely and\nquickly, and not that any real beings having feet are designated by this\ncomparison. The ship that carries the worshippers across all dangers, is the\nprotection and help which Agni grants, or the sacrifice which he helps to\nperform.\n\np. 146\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 275.\n\nNote 2. Yanta _h_ seems to be corrupt; one or two syllables are wanting.\nSomething like yatayanta _h_ (IX, 39, 2) or vardhayanta _h_ , or, as Prof. Max\nMuller proposes, vyanta _h_ would do. He translates: 'May Heaven and Earth and\nthe Rivers \xe2\x80\xa6 accepting (vyanta _h_ ) sacrifices of milk and corn choose for\nus, and may the Dawns choose for us food as a boon for many days.'--Cf.\nLanman, pp. 510, 539.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 141](sbe46039.htm)\n\n"
