Determinate perception\nclearly has for its object things affected with difference; for it relates to\nthat which is distinguished by generic difference and so on. But also non-\ndeterminate perception has for its object only what is marked with difference;\nfor it is on the basis of non-determinate perception that the object\ndistinguished by generic character and so on is recognised in the act of\ndeterminate perception. Non-determinate perception is the apprehension of the\nobject in so far as destitute of some differences but not of all difference.\nApprehension of the latter kind is in the first place not observed ever to\ntake place, and is in the second place impossible: for all apprehension by\nconsciousness takes place by means of some distinction 'This is such and\nsuch.' Nothing can be apprehended apart from some special feature of make or\nstructure, as e.g. the triangularly shaped dewlap in the case of cows. The\ntrue distinction between non-determinate and determinate perception is that\nthe former is the apprehension of the first individual among a number of\nthings belonging to the same class, while the latter is the apprehension of\nthe second, third, and so on, individuals. On the apprehension of the first\nindividual cow the perceiving person is not conscious of the fact that the\nspecial shape which constitutes the generic character of the class 'cows'\nextends to the present individual also; while this special consciousness\narises in the case of the perception of the second and third cow. The\nperception of the second individual thus is 'determinate' in so far as it is\ndetermined by a special attribute, viz. the extension, to the perception, of\nthe generic character of a class--manifested in a certain\n\np. 42\n\noutward shape--which connects this act of perception with the earlier\nperception (of the first individual); such determination being ascertained\nonly on the apprehension of the second individual. Such extension or\ncontinuance of a certain generic character is, on the other hand, not\napprehended on the apprehension of the first individual, and perception of the\nlatter kind thence is 'non-determinate.' That it is such is not due to non-\napprehension of structure, colour, generic character and so on, for all these\nattributes are equally objects of sensuous perception (and hence perceived as\nbelonging to the first individual also). Moreover that which possesses\nstructure cannot be perceived apart from the structure, and hence in the case\nof the apprehension of the first individual there is already perception of\nstructure, giving rise to the judgment 'The thing is such and such.' In the\ncase of the second, third, &c., individuals, on the other hand, we apprehend,\nin addition to the thing possessing structure and to the structure itself, the\nspecial attribute of the persistence of the generic character, and hence the\nperception is 'determinate.' From all this it follows that perception never\nhas for its object that which is devoid of all difference.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The bhedabheda view is untenable](sbe48012.htm)\n\n"
