If it be said that otherwise the separation (of the statements) cannot be\naccounted for; we reply that it is (here) as in the case of other\ninstructions.\n\nWe yet have to refute the remark made by the purvapakshin that, unless the\nseparateness of the two vidyas be admitted, the separation of the two\nstatements cannot be accounted for. We do this by pointing to analogous cases.\nIn the sixth prapa _th_ aka of the upanishad of the Ta _n_ _d_ ins the\ninstruction conveyed in the words, 'That is the Self, thou art that, O _S_\nvetaketu,' is repeated nine times, and yet the one vidya is not thereby split\ninto many. Similarly in our case.--But how do you know that the vidya remains\none and the same in spite of the ninefold repetition?--Because, we reply, the\nintroductory and concluding clauses show that all those passages have the same\nsense. For the repeated request on the part of _S_ vetaketu, 'Please, Sir,\ninform me still more,' shows that one and the same matter is again and again\nproposed for further discussion, and further instruction regarding it is\nrepeatedly given by means of new doubts being removed. Similarly, in the case\nunder discussion, the sameness of form of the two introductory questions and\nthe equality of the concluding clauses, 'Everything else is of evil,' show\nthat both sections refer to one and the same matter.--Moreover, in the second\nquestion the text adds the word: 'just' (eva), 'Tell me just that Brahman,'\n&c., which shows that the second question refers to the same matter as the\nfirst one. That the matter of the two sections is really the same, we\nestablish by pointing out that the former section declares the existence of\nthe highest Self which is neither cause nor effect, while the latter qualifies\nit as that which transcends all the attributes of the Sa _m_ sara state, such\nas hunger, thirst, and so on.--The two sections, therefore, form one vidya\nonly.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 37](sbe38180.htm)\n\n"
