After having worshipped, on each Ash _t_ aka, the gods and performed, with\nvegetables, meat, and cakes respectively, a _S_ raddha (according to the rules\ngiven in the last chapter), he must, on each Anvash _t_ aka[1], worship the\ngods and offer a burnt-oblation in the same way as on the Ash _t_ aka (i.e.\nreciting the same three Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ akas successively), and entertain Brahma _n_\nas in the same way as (directed) before (in the preceding chapter), in honour\nof his mother, his paternal grandmother, and his paternal great-grandmother,\nhonour them with presents, accompany them (as far as the limits of his\nestate), and dismiss them\n\n2\\. Then he must dig (six) trenches.\n\n3\\. On the border of these trenches, to the northeast of them, he must light\nfires and place balls of rice.\n\n4\\. On the border of three of the trenches (he must place balls) for the men,\nand on the border of the other three (he must place balls) for the women.\n\n[LXXIV. 1-8, \xc3\x82 _s_ v. II, 5; Gobh. IV, 2; Par. III, 3, 10-12; _S_ a _n_ kh.\nIII, 13, 6; M. IV, 150. Regarding the corresponding section of the _K_ a _th_\naka G _ri_ hya-sutra, see the Introduction.\n\n1\\. 1 See LXXIII, 8, 9; LXXVI, 1.--2 Nand. considers the use of the particle\n_k_ a to imply that the father together with the other paternal ancestors, and\nthe maternal grandfather along with the other maternal ancestors, should also\nbe invoked, which would make in all nine ancestors to be invoked. The first\npart of this observation appears to be correct, but the maternal grandfather\nand the rest are neither referred to in the following Sutras, nor in the _K_ a\n_th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra.\n\n2\\. Nand. gives it as his opinion, that nine trenches should be made, three of\nwhich are to be for the maternal grandfather, &c. But Sutra 4 refers to three\ntrenches for the men only, and the _K_ a _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra expressly\nmentions the number of six trenches.]\n\np. 239\n\n5\\. He must fill the three trenches for the men with water mixed with food.\n\n6\\. (He must fill) the three trenches for the women with milk mixed with food.\n\n7\\. (And he must fill up) each triad of trenches singly with sour milk, meat,\nand milk.\n\n8\\. After having filled (the trenches), he must mutter the Mantra, 'May this\n(food) be imperishable for ye men and for ye women.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LXXV.](sbe07077.htm)\n\n"
