XXXI.\n\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, with Indra\'s consent, takes the Parijata tree to Dwaraka; marries\nthe princesses rescued from Naraka.\n\nKE\xc5\x9aAVA, being thus eulogized by the king of the gods, smiled, and spake\ngravely to him in reply. "Thou art Indra," said he, "the king of the\ncelestials: we are but mortals, O lord of the world: thou must pardon\ntherefore the offence that I have committed. Let this Parijata tree be taken\nto its appropriate situation. I removed it in compliance with the words of\nSatya. Receive back also this your thunderbolt, cast at me; for this is your\nproper weapon, the destroyer of your foes." Indra answered and said, "Thou\nbeguilest us, O lord, in calling thyself a mortal; but we know thee to be the\nlord, although not endowed with subtlety of discernment. Thou art that thou\nart, engaged in the active preservation of the earth; thou extractest the\nthorns implanted in her bosom, destroyer of the demon race. Let this Parijata\ntree be transferred to Dwaraka, and it shall remain upon earth as long as thou\nabidest in the world of mortals." Hari, having assented to the proposal of\nIndra, returned to earth, hymned by attendant sages, saints, and quiristers of\nheaven.\n\nWhen Krishn\xcc\x81a arrived over Dwaraka, he blew his shell, and delighted all the\ninhabitants with the sound. Then alighting from Garud\xcc\x81a, he proceeded with\nSatyabhama to her garden, and there planted the great Parijata tree, the smell\nof which perfumed the earth for three furlongs, and an approach to which\nenabled every one to recollect the events of a prior existence; so that, on\nbeholding their faces in that tree, all the Yadavas contemplated themselves in\ntheir (original) celestial forms. Then Krishn\xcc\x81a took possession of the wealth,\nelephants, horses, and women, which he had recovered from Naraka, and which\nhad been brought to Dwaraka by the servants of the demon; and at an auspicious\nseason he espoused all the maidens whom Naraka had carried off from their\nfriends;\n\np. 590\n\nat one and the same moment he received the hands of all of them, according to\nthe ritual, in separate mansions. Sixteen thousand and one hundred was the\nnumber of the maidens, and into so many different forms did the foe of Madhu\nmultiply himself; so that every one of the damsels thought that he had wedded\nher in his single person; and the creator of the world, Hari, the assumer of\nuniversal shape, abode severally in the dwelling of each of these his wives.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXII](vp149.htm)\n\n'
