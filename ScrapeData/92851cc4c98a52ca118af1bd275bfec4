The laying of the formerly-described sacrificial fires 1 is indeed the\nsacrifice of Brahman. Therefore let the sacrificer, after he has laid those\nfires, meditate on the Self. Thus only does the sacrificer become complete and\nfaultless.\n\nBut who is to be meditated on? He who is called Pra _n_ a (breath). Of him\nthere is this story:\n\n2\\. A King, named B _ri_ hadratha, having established his son in his\nsovereignty 2, went into the forest, because he considered this body as\ntransient, and had obtained freedom from all desires. Having performed the\nhighest penance, he stands there, with uplifted arms, looking up to the sun.\nAt the end of a thousand (days) 3, the Saint Sakayanya 4, who knew the Self,\ncame near 5, burning with splendour,\n\np. 288\n\nlike a fire without smoke. He said to the King: 'Rise, rise! Choose a boon!'\n\nThe King, bowing before him, said: 'O Saint, I know not the Self, thou knowest\nthe essence (of the Self). We have heard so. Teach it us.'\n\n_S_ akayanya replied: 'This was achieved of yore; but what thou askest is\ndifficult to obtain 1. O Aikshvaka, choose other pleasures.'\n\nThe King, touching the Saint's feet with his head, recited this Gatha:\n\n3\\. 'O Saint, What is the use of the enjoyment of pleasures in this offensive,\npithless body--a mere mass of bones, skin, sinews, marrow 2, flesh, seed,\nblood, mucus, tears, phlegm, ordure, water 3, bile, and slime! What is the use\nof the enjoyment of pleasures in this body which is assailed by lust, hatred,\ngreed, delusion, fear, anguish, jealousy, separation from what is loved, union\nwith what is not loved 4, hunger, thirst, old age, death, illness, grief, and\nother evils!\n\n4\\. And we see that all this is perishable, as these flies, gnats, and other\ninsects, as herbs and trees 5,\n\np. 289\n\ngrowing and decaying. And what of these? There are other great ones, mighty\nwielders of bows, rulers of empires, Sudyumna, Bhuridyumna, Indradyumna,\nKuvalaya _s_ va, Yauvana _s_ va, Vadhrya _s_ va, A _s_ vapati 1, _S_ a _s_\nabindu, Hari _s_ _k_ andra, Ambarisha 2, Nahusha, Ananata, _S_ aryati, Yayati,\nAnara _n_ ya 3, Ukshasena 4, &c., and kings such as Marutta, Bharata\n(Daushyanti), and others, who before the eyes of their whole family\nsurrendered the greatest happiness, and passed on from this world to that. And\nwhat of these? There are other great ones. We see the destruction 5 of\nGandharvas, Asuras 6, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Bhutas, Ga _n_ as, Pi _s_ a _k_ as,\nsnakes, and vampires. And what of these? There is the drying up of other great\noceans, the falling of mountains, the moving of the pole-star, the cutting of\nthe wind-ropes (that hold the stars), the submergence of the earth, and the\ndeparture of the gods (suras) from their place. In such a world as this, what\nis the use of the enjoyment of pleasures, if he who has fed 7 on them is seen\n8 to return (to this world) again\n\np. 290\n\nand again! Deign therefore to take me out! In this world I am like a frog in a\ndry well. O Saint, thou art my way, thou art my way.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[287:1](sbe15112.htm#fr_926) The performance of all the sacrifices, described\nin the Maitraya _n_ a-brahma _n_ a, is to lead up in the end to a knowledge of\nBrahman, by rendering a man fit for receiving the highest knowledge. See Manu\nVI, 82: 'All that has been declared (above) depends on meditation; for he who\nis not proficient in the knowledge of the Self reaps not the full reward of\nthe performance of rites.'\n\n[287:2](sbe15112.htm#fr_927) Instead of vira _g_ ye, a doubtful word, and\noccurring nowhere else, m. reads vaira _g_ ye.\n\n[287:3](sbe15112.htm#fr_928) Or years, if we read sahasrasya instead of\nsahasrahasya.\n\n[287:4](sbe15112.htm#fr_929) The descendant of _S_ akayana. Saint is perhaps\ntoo strong; it means a holy, venerable man, and is frequently applied to a\nBuddha.\n\n[287:5](sbe15112.htm#fr_930) Both M. and m. add mune _h_ before antikam,\nwhereas the commentary has ra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_.\n\n[288:1](sbe15112.htm#fr_931) Though the commentator must have read etad v _ri_\nttam purastad du _h_ _s_ akyam etat pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ am, yet pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ am as a\nneuter is very strange. M. reads etad v _ri_ ttam purastat, du _s_ _s_ akama\npri _k_ _kh_ a pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ am; m. reads etad vratam purastad a _s_ akyam ma\npri _kh_ a pras\xc3\xb1am aikshvaka, &c. This suggests the reading, etad v _ri_ ttam\npurastad du _h_ _s_ akam mi prikkha pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ am, i.e. this was settled\nformerly, do not ask a difficult or an impossible question.\n\n[288:2](sbe15112.htm#fr_932) Read ma _g_ _g_ a.\n\n[288:3](sbe15112.htm#fr_933) M. adds vata before pitta; not m.\n\n[288:4](sbe15112.htm#fr_934) An expression that often occurs in Buddhist\nliterature. See also Manu VI, 62: 'On their separation from those whom they\nlove, and their union with those whom they hate; on their strength overpowered\nby old age, and their bodies racked with disease.'\n\n[288:5](sbe15112.htm#fr_935) The Sandhi vanaspatayodbhuta for vanaspataya\nudbhuta is anomalous. M. reads vanaspatayo bhutapradhva _m_ sina _h_.\n\n[289:1](sbe15112.htm#fr_936) M. carries on a _s_ vapati _s_ a _s_ abinduhari\n_s_ _k_ andrambarisha.\n\n[289:2](sbe15112.htm#fr_937) After Ambarisha, M. reads Nabhushananutu _s_\nayyatiyayatyanara _n_ yakshasenadayo. Nahusha (Naghusha?) is the father of _S_\naryati; Nabhaga, the father of Ambarisha. These names are so carelessly\nwritten that even the commentator says that the text is either _kh_ andasa or\npramadika. Ananata is a mere conjecture. It occurs as the name of a _Ri_ shi\nin _Ri_ g-veda IX, 111.\n\n[289:3](sbe15112.htm#fr_938) Anaranya, mentioned in the Mahabharata, I, 230.\n\n[289:4](sbe15112.htm#fr_939) M. reads anara _n_ yakshasena.\n\n[289:5](sbe15112.htm#fr_940) M. and m. read nirodhanam.\n\n[289:6](sbe15112.htm#fr_941) M. adds Apsarasas.\n\n[289:7](sbe15112.htm#fr_942) AL and m. read a _s_ ritasya, but the commentator\nexplains a _s_ itasya.\n\n[289:8](sbe15112.htm#fr_943) Here we have the Maitraya _n_ a Sandhi, d _ri_\n_s_ yata iti, instead of d _ri_ syata iti; see von Schroeder, Maitraya _n_ i\nSa _m_ hita, p. xxviii. M. and m. read drisyata.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Second Prapathaka](sbe15113.htm)\n\n"
