There is entering into similarity of being with those, there being a\nreason.\n\nThe text describes the manner in which those who perform sacrifices, and so\non, descend from the moon as follows: 'They return again that way as they\ncame, to the ether, from the ether to the air. Then having become air they\nbecome smoke, having become smoke they become mist,' &c. The doubt here arises\nwhether the soul when reaching ether, and so on, becomes ether in the same\nsense as here on earth it becomes a man or other being, or merely becomes\nsimilar to ether, and so on.--The former view is the true one; for as the soul\nin the _s_ raddha state becomes the moon, so it must likewise be held to\n_become_ ether, and so on, there being no reason for a difference in the two\ncases.--This prima facie view the Sutra sets aside. The descending soul enters\ninto similarity of being with ether, and so on; since there is a reason for\nthis. When the soul becomes a man or becomes the moon, there is a reason for\nthat, since it thereby becomes capacitated for the enjoyment of pain and\npleasure. But there is no similar reason for the soul becoming ether, and so\non, and hence the statement that the soul becomes ether, and so on, can only\nmean that, owing to contact with them, it becomes similar to them.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'entering into similarity of being.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 23.
