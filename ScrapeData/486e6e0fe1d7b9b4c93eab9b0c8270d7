The Indians, the Persians, and the Arabians, were all\nfamous for their fables. Amongst the ancient Greeks we hear of the Ionian and\nMilesian tales, but they have now perished, and, from every account we hear of\nthem, appear to have been loose and indelicate." Similarly, the classical\ndictionaries define "Milesiae fabulae" to be "licentious themes," "stories of\nan amatory or mirthful nature," or "ludicrous and indecent plays." M. Deriege\nseems indeed to confound them with the "Moeurs du Temps" illustrated with\nartistic gouaches, when he says, "une de ces fables milesiennes, rehaussees de\npeintures, que la corruption romaine recherchait alors avec une folle ardeur."\n\nMy friend, Mr. Richard Charnock, F.A.S.L., more correctly defines Milesian\nfables to have been originally " certain tales or novels, composed by\nAristides of Miletus "; gay in matter and graceful in manner. "They were\ntranslated into Latin by the historian Sisenna, the friend of Atticus, and\nthey had a great success at Rome. Plutarch, in his life of Crassus, tells us\nthat after the defeat of Carhes (Carrhae?) some Milesiacs were found in the\nbaggage of the Roman prisoners. The Greek text; and the Latin translation have\nlong been lost. The only surviving fable is the tale of Cupid and Psyche,[1]\nwhich Apuleius calls \'Milesius sermo,\' and it makes us deeply regret the\ndisappearance of the others." Besides this there are the remains of\nApollodorus and Conon, and a few traces to be found in Pausanias, Athenaeus,\nand the scholiasts.\n\nI do not, therefore, agree with Blair, with the dictionaries, or with M.\nDeriege. Miletus, the great maritime city of Asiatic Ionia, was of old the\nmeeting-place of the East and the West. Here the Phoenician trader from the\nBaltic would meet the Hindu wandering to Intra, from Extra, Gangem; and the\nHyperborean would step on shore side by side with the Nubian and the Aethiop.\nHere was produced and published for the use of the then civilized world, the\ngenuine Oriental apologue, myth and tale combined, which, by amusing narrative\nand romantic adventure, insinuates a lesson in morals or in humanity, of which\nwe often in our days must fail to perceive the drift. The book of Apuleius,\nbefore quoted, is subject to as many discoveries of recondite meaning as is\nRabelais. As regards the licentiousness of the Milesian fables, this sign of\nsemi-civilization is still inherent in most Eastern books of the description\nwhich we call "light literature," and the ancestral tale-teller never collects\na larger purse of coppers than when he relates the worst of his "aurei." But\nthis looseness, resulting from the separation of the sexes, is accidental, not\nnecessary. The following collection will show that it can be dispensed with,\nand that there is such a thing as camparative purity in Hindu literature. The\nauthor, indeed, almost always takes the trouble to marry his hero and his\nheroine, and if he cannot find a priest, he generally adopts an exceedingly\nleft-hand and Caledonian but legal rite called "gandharbavivaha.[2]"\n\nThe work of Apuleius, as ample internal evidence shows, is borrowed from the\nEast. The groundwork of the tale is the metamorphosis of Lucius of Corinth\ninto an ass, and the strange accidents which precede his recovering the human\nform.\n\nAnother old Hindu story-book relates, in the popular fairy-book style, the\nwondrous adventures of the hero and demigod, the great Gandharba-Sena. That\nson of Indra, who was also the father of Vikramajit, the subject of this and\nanother collection, offended the ruler of the firmament by his fondness for a\ncertain nymph, and was doomed to wander over earth under the form of a donkey.\nThrough the interposition of the gods, however, he was permitted to become a\nman during the hours of darkness, thus comparing with the English legend--\n\nAmundeville is lord by day, But the monk is lord by night.\n\nWhilst labouring under this curse, Gandharba-Sena persuaded the King of Dhara\nto give him a daughter in marriage, but it unfortunately so happened that at\nthe wedding hour he was unable to show himself in any but asinine shape. After\nbathing, however, he proceeded to the assembly, and, hearing songs and music,\nhe resolved to give them a specimen of his voice.\n\nThe guests were filled with sorrow that so beautiful a virgin should be\nmarried to a donkey. They were afraid to express their feelings to the king,\nbut they could not refrain from smiling, covering their mouths with their\ngarments. At length some one interrupted the general silence and said:\n\n"O king, is this the son of Indra? You have found a fine bridegroom; you are\nindeed happy; don\'t delay the marriage; delay is improper in doing good; we\nnever saw so glorious a wedding! It is true that we once heard of a camel\nbeing married to a jenny-ass; when the ass, looking up to the camel, said,\n\'Bless me, what a bridegroom!\' and the camel, hearing the voice of the ass,\nexclaimed, \'Bless me, what a musical voice!\' In that wedding, however, the\nbride and the bridegroom were equal; but in this marriage, that such a bride\nshould have such a bridegroom is truly wonderful."\n\nOther Brahmans then present said:\n\n"O king, at the marriage hour, in sign of joy the sacred shell is blown, but\nthou hast no need of that" (alluding to the donkey\'s braying).\n\nThe women all cried out:\n\n"O my mother![3] what is this? at the time of marriage to have an ass! What a\nmiserable thing! What! will he give that angelic girl in wedlock to a donkey?"\n\nAt length Gandharba-Sena, addressing the king in Sanskrit, urged him to\nperform his promise. He reminded his future father-in-law that there is no act\nmore meritorious than speaking truth; that the mortal frame is a mere dress,\nand that wise men never estimate the value of a person by his clothes. He\nadded that he was in that shape from the curse of his sire, and that during\nthe night he had the body of a man. Of his being the son of Indra there could\nbe no doubt.\n\nHearing the donkey thus speak Sanskrit, for it was never known that an ass\ncould discourse in that classical tongue, the minds of the people were\nchanged, and they confessed that, although he had an asinine form he was\nunquestionably the son of Indra. The king, therefore, gave him his daughter in\nmarriage.[4] The metamorphosis brings with it many misfortunes and strange\noccurrences, and it lasts till Fate in the author\'s hand restores the hero to\nhis former shape and honours.\n\nGandharba-Sena is a quasi-historical personage, who lived in the century\npreceding the Christian era. The story had, therefore, ample time to reach the\nears of the learned African Apuleius, who was born A.D. 130.\n\nThe Baital-Pachisi, or Twenty-five (tales of a) Baital[5]--a Vampire or evil\nspirit which animates dead bodies--is an old and thoroughly Hindu repertory.\nIt is the rude beginning of that fictitious history which ripened to the\nArabian Nights\' Entertainments, and which, fostered by the genius of\nBoccaccio, produced the romance of the chivalrous days, and its last\ndevelopment, the novel--that prose-epic of modern Europe.\n\nComposed in Sanskrit, "the language of the gods," alias the Latin of India, it\nhas been translated into all the Prakrit or vernacular and modern dialects of\nthe great peninsula. The reason why it has not found favour with the Moslems\nis doubtless the highly polytheistic spirit which pervades it; moreover, the\nFaithful had already a specimen of that style of composition. This was the\nHitopadesa, or Advice of a Friend, which, as a line in its introduction\ninforms us, was borrowed from an older book, the Panchatantra, or Five\nChapters. It is a collection of apologues recited by a learned Brahman, Vishnu\nSharma by name, for the edification of his pupils, the sons of an Indian Raja.\nThey have been adapted to or translated into a number of languages, notably\ninto Pehlvi and Persian, Syriac and Turkish, Greek and Latin, Hebrew and\nArabic. And as the Fables of Pilpay,[6] are generally known, by name at least,\nto European litterateurs. . Voltaire remarks,[7] "Quand on fait reflexion que\npresque toute la terre a ete infatuee de pareils comes, et qu\'ils ont fait\nl\'education du genre humain, on trouve les fables de Pilpay, Lokman, d\'Esope\nbien raisonnables." These tales, detached, but strung together by artificial\nmeans--pearls with a thread drawn through them--are manifest precursors of the\nDecamerone, or Ten Days. A modern Italian critic describes the now classical\nfiction as a collection of one hundred of those novels which Boccaccio is\nbelieved to have read out at the court of Queen Joanna of Naples, and which\nlater in life were by him assorted together by a most simple and ingenious\ncontrivance. But the great Florentine invented neither his stories nor his "\nplot," if we may so call it. He wrote in the middle of the fourteenth century\n(1344-8) when the West had borrowed many things from the East, rhymes[8] and\nromance, lutes and drums, alchemy and knight-errantry. Many of the "Novelle"\nare, as Orientalists well know, to this day sung and recited almost textually\nby the wandering tale-tellers, bards, and rhapsodists of Persia and Central\nAsia.\n\nThe great kshatriya,(soldier) king Vikramaditya,[9] or Vikramarka, meaning the\n"Sun of Heroism," plays in India the part of King Arthur, and of Harun al-\nRashid further West. He is a semi-historical personage. The son of Gandharba-\nSena the donkey and the daughter of the King of Dhara, he was promised by his\nfather the strength of a thousand male elephants. When his sire died, his\ngrandfather, the deity Indra, resolved that the babe should not be born, upon\nwhich his mother stabbed herself. But the tragic event duly happening during\nthe ninth month, Vikram came into the world by himself, and was carried to\nIndra, who pitied and adopted him, and gave him a good education.\n\nThe circumstances of his accession to the throne, as will presently appear,\nare differently told. Once, however, made King of Malaya, the modern Malwa, a\nprovince of Western Upper India, he so distinguished himself that the Hindu\nfabulists, with their usual brave kind of speaking, have made him "bring the\nwhole earth under the shadow of one umbrella,"\n\nThe last ruler of the race of Mayura, which reigned 318 years, was Raja-pal.\nHe reigned 25 years, but giving himself up to effeminacy, his country was\ninvaded by Shakaditya, a king from the highlands of Kumaon. Vikramaditya, in\nthe fourteenth year of his reign, pretended to espouse the cause of Raja-pal,\nattacked and destroyed Shakaditya, and ascended the throne of Delhi. His\ncapital was Avanti, or Ujjayani, the modern Ujjain. It was 13 kos (26 miles)\nlong by 18 miles wide, an area of 468 square miles, but a trifle in Indian\nHistory. He obtained the title of Shakari, "foe of the Shakas," the Sacae or\nScythians, by his victories over that redoubtable race. In the Kali Yug, or\nIron Age, he stands highest amongst the Hindu kings as the patron of learning.\nNine persons under his patronage, popularly known as the "Nine Gems of\nScience," hold in India the honourable position of the Seven Wise Men of\nGreece.\n\nThese learned persons wrote works in the eighteen original dialects from\nwhich, say the Hindus, all the languages of the earth have been derived.[10]\nDhanwantari enlightened the world upon the subjects of medicine and of\nincantations. Kshapanaka treated the primary elements. Amara-Singha compiled a\nSanskrit dictionary and a philosophical treatise. Shankubetalabhatta composed\ncomments, and Ghatakarpara a poetical work of no great merit. The books of\nMihira are not mentioned. Varaha produced two works on astrology and one on\narithmetic. And Bararuchi introduced certain improvements in grammar,\ncommented upon the incantations, and wrote a poem in praise of King Madhava.\n\nBut the most celebrated of all the patronized ones was Kalidasa. His two\ndramas, Sakuntala,[11] and Vikram and Urvasi,[12] have descended to our day;\nbesides which he produced a poem on the seasons, a work on astronomy, a\npoetical history of the gods, and many other books.[13]\n\nVikramaditya established the Sambat era, dating from A.C. 56. After a long,\nhappy, and glorious reign, he lost his life in a war with Shalivahana, King of\nPratisthana. That monarch also left behind him an era called the " Shaka,"\nbeginning with A.D. 78. It is employed, even now, by the Hindus in recording\ntheir births, marriages, and similar occasions.\n\nKing Vikramaditya was succeeded by his infant son Vikrama-Sena, and father and\nson reigned over a period of 93 years. At last the latter was supplanted by a\ndevotee named Samudra-pala, who entered into his body by miraculous means. The\nusurper reigned 24 years and 2 months, and the throne of Delhi continued in\nthe hands of his sixteen successors, who reigned 641 years and 3 months.\nVikrama-pala,, the last, was slain in battle by Tilaka-chandra, King of\nVaharannah[14].\n\nIt is not pretended that the words of these Hindu tales are preserved to the\nletter. The question about the metamorphosis of cats into tigers, for\ninstance, proceeded from a Gem of Learning in a university much nearer home\nthan Gaur. Similarly the learned and still living Mgr. Gaume (Traite du Saint-\nEsprit, p.. 81) joins Camerarius in the belief that serpents bite women rather\nthan men. And he quotes (p.. 192) Cornelius a Lapide, who informs us that the\nleopard is the produce of a lioness with a hyena or a bard..\n\nThe merit of the old stories lies in their suggestiveness and in their general\napplicability. I have ventured to remedy the conciseness of their language,\nand to clothe the skeleton with flesh and blood.\n\nTo My Uncle, ROBERT BAGSHAW, OF DOVERCOURT, These Tales, That Will Remind Him\nOf A Land Which He Knows So Well, Are Affectionately Inscribed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Introduction](vav04.htm)\n\n'
