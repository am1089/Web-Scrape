Up. VI, 2, 1); \'The higher knowledge is that by which the\nIndestructible is apprehended\' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5); \'That which cannot be seen\nnor seized, which has no eyes nor ears, no hands nor feet, the permanent, the\nall-pervading, the most subtle, the imperishable which the wise regard as the\nsource of all beings\' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 6); \'The True, knowledge, the Infinite is\nBrahman\' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); \'He who is without parts, without actions,\ntranquil, without fault, without taint\' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 19); \'By whom it is\nnot thought, by him it is thought; he by whom it is thought knows it not. It\nis not known by those who know it, known by those who do not know it\' (Ke. Up.\nII, 3); \'Thou mayest not see the seer of sight; thou mayest not think the\nthinker of thought\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 4, 2); \'Bliss is Brahman\' (Taitt. Up.\nIII, 6, 1); \'All this is that Self\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 7); \'There is here no\ndiversity whatever\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 19); \'From death to death goes he who\nsees any difference here\' (Ka. Up. II, 4, 10); \'For where there is duality as\nit were, there one sees the other\'; \'but where the Self has become all of him,\nby what means, and whom, should he see? by what means, and whom, should he\nknow?\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15); \'the effect is a name merely which has its\norigin in speech; the truth is that (the thing made of clay) is clay merely\' (\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 1, 4); \'for if he makes but the smallest distinction in it there\nis fear for him\' (Taitt. Up. II, 7);--the two following Vedanta-sutras: III,\n2, 11; III, 2, 3--the following passages from the Vish _n_ u-pura _n_ a:\n\np. 21\n\n[paragraph continues] \'In which all difference vanishes, which is pure Being,\nwhich is not the object of words, which is known by the Self only--that\nknowledge is called Brahman\' (VI, 7, 53); \'Him whose essential nature is\nknowledge, who is stainless in reality\'; \'Him who, owing to erroneous view,\nabides in the form of things\' (I, 2, 6); \'the Reality thou art alone, there is\nno other, O Lord of the world!--whatever matter is seen belongs to thee whose\nbeing is knowledge; but owing to their erroneous opinion the non-devout look\non it as the form of the world. This whole world has knowledge for its\nessential nature, but the Unwise viewing it as being of the nature of material\nthings are driven round on the ocean of delusion. Those however who possess\ntrue knowledge and pure minds see this whole world as having knowledge for its\nSelf, as thy form, O highest Lord!\' (Vi. Pu. I, 4, 38 ff.).--\'Of that Self,\nalthough it exists in one\'s own and in other bodies, the knowledge is of one\nkind, and that is Reality; those who maintain duality hold a false view\' (II,\n14, 31); \'If there is some other one, different from me, then it can be said,\n"I am this and that one is another"\' (II, 13, 86); \'As owing to the difference\nof the holes of the flute the air equally passing through them all is called\nby the names of the different notes of the musical scale; so it is with the\nuniversal Self\' (II, 14, 32); \'He is I; he is thou; he is all: this Universe\nis his form. Abandon the error of difference. The king being thus instructed,\nabandoned the view of difference, having gained an intuition of Reality\' (II,\n16, 24). \'When that view which gives rise to difference is absolutely\ndestroyed, who then will make the untrue distinction between the individual\nSelf and Brahman?\' (VI, 7, 94).--The following passages from the Bhagavad-\nGita: \'I am the Self dwelling within all beings\' (X, 20); \'Know me to be the\nsoul within all bodies\' (XIII, 2); \'Being there is none, movable or immovable,\nwhich is without me\' (X, 39).--All these and other texts, the purport of which\nclearly is instruction as to the essential nature of things, declare that\nBrahman only, i.e. non-differenced pure intelligence is real, while everything\nelse is false.\n\np. 22\n\n#### The appearance of plurality is due to avidya.\n\n\'Falsehood\' (mithyatva) belongs to what admits of being terminated by the\ncognition of the real thing--such cognition being preceded by conscious\nactivity (not by mere absence of consciousness or knowledge). The snake, e.g.\nwhich has for its substrate a rope or the like is false; for it is due to an\nimperfection (dosha) that the snake is imagined in (or \'on\') the rope. In the\nsame way this entire world, with its distinctions of gods, men, animals,\ninanimate matter, and so on, is, owing to an imperfection, wrongly imagined in\nthe highest Brahman whose substance is mere intelligence, and therefore is\nfalse in so far as it may be sublated by the cognition of the nature of the\nreal Brahman. What constitutes that imperfection is beginningless Nescience\n(avidya), which, hiding the truth of things, gives rise to manifold illusions,\nand cannot be defined either as something that is or as something that is\nnot.--\'By the Untrue they are hidden; of them which are true the Untrue is the\ncovering\' ( _Kh_ , Up. VIII, 3, 1); \'Know Maya to be Prak _ri_ ti, and the\ngreat Lord him who is associated with Maya\' ( _S_ vet. Up. IV, 10); \'Indra\nappears manifold through the Mayas\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 5, 19); \'My Maya is hard\nto overcome\' (Bha. Gi. VII, 14); \'When the soul slumbering in beginningless\nMaya awakes\' (Gau. Ka. I, 16).--These and similar texts teach that it is\nthrough beginningless Maya that to Brahman which truly is pure non-differenced\nintelligence its own nature hides itself, and that it sees diversity within\nitself. As has been said, \'Because the Holy One is essentially of the nature\nof intelligence, the form of all, but not material; therefore know that all\nparticular things like rocks, oceans, hills and so on, have proceeded from\nintelligence 1 But when, on\n\np. 23\n\nthe cessation of all work, everything is only pure intelligence in its own\nproper form, without any imperfections; then no differences--the fruit of the\ntree of wishes--any longer exist between things. Therefore nothing whatever,\nat any place or any time, exists apart from intelligence: intelligence, which\nis one only, is viewed as manifold by those whose minds are distracted by the\neffects of their own works. Intelligence pure, free from stain, free from\ngrief, free from all contact with desire and other affections, everlastingly\none is the highest Lord--Vasudeva apart from whom nothing exists. I have thus\ndeclared to you the lasting truth of things--that intelligence only is true\nand everything else untrue. And that also which is the cause of ordinary\nworldly existence has been declared to you\' (Vi. Pu. II, 12, 39, 40, 43-45).\n\n#### Avidya is put an end to by true Knowledge.\n\nOther texts declare that this Nescience comes to an end through the cognition\nof the essential unity of the Self with Brahman which is nothing but non-\ndifferenced intelligence. \'He does not again go to death;\' \'He sees this as\none;\' \'He who sees this does not see death\' ( _Kh._ Up. VI, 27); \'When he\nfinds freedom from fear and rest in that which is invisible, incorporeal,\nundefined, unsupported, then he has obtained the fearless\' (Taitt. Up. II, 7);\n\'The fetter of the heart is broken, all doubts are solved and all his works\nperish when he has been beheld who is high and low\' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8); \'He\nknows Brahman, he becomes Brahman only\' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9); \'Knowing him only\na man passes over death; there is no other path to go\' ( _S_ vet. Up. III, 8).\nIn these and similar passages, the term \'death\' denotes Nescience; analogously\nto the use of the term in the following words of Sanatsu _g_ ata, \'Delusion I\ncall death; and freedom from delusion I call immortality\' (Sanatsu _g_. II,\n5). The knowledge again of the essential unity and non-difference of Brahman--\nwhich is ascertained from decisive texts such as \'The True, knowledge, the\nInfinite is Brahman\' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); \'Knowledge, bliss is\n\np. 24\n\nBrahman\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 28)--is confirmed by other passages, such as\n\'Now if a man meditates on another deity, thinking the deity is one and he\nanother, he does not know\' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10); \'Let men meditate upon him\nas the Self (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 7); \'Thou art that\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 7); \'Am\nI thou, O holy deity? and art thou me, O holy deity?\'; \'What I am that is he;\nwhat he is that am I.\'--This the Sutrakara himself will declare \'But as the\nSelf (scriptural texts) acknowledge and make us apprehend (the Lord)\' (Ve. Su.\nIV, 1, 3). Thus the Vakyakara also, \'It is the Self--thus one should apprehend\n(everything), for everything is effected by that.\' And to hold that by such\ncognition of the oneness of Brahman essentially false bondage, together with\nits cause, comes to an end, is only reasonable.\n\n#### Scripture is of greater force than Perception\n\nBut, an objection is raised--how can knowledge, springing from the sacred\ntexts, bring about a cessation of the view of difference, in manifest\nopposition to the evidence of Perception?--How then, we rejoin, can the\nknowledge that this thing is a rope and not a snake bring about, in opposition\nto actual perception, the cessation of the (idea of the) snake?--You will\nperhaps reply that in this latter case there is a conflict between two forms\nof perception, while in the case under discussion the conflict is between\ndirect perception and Scripture which is based on perception. But against this\nwe would ask the question how, in the case of a conflict between two equal\ncognitions, we decide as to which of the two is refuted (sublated) by the\nother. If--as is to be expected--you reply that what makes the difference\nbetween the two is that one of them is due to a defective cause while the\nother is not: we point out that this distinction holds good also in the case\nof Scripture and perception being in conflict. It is not considerations as to\nthe equality of conflicting cognitions, as to their being dependent or\nindependent, and so on, that determine which of the two sublates the other; if\nthat were\n\np. 25\n\nthe case, the perception which presents to us the flame of the lamp as one\nonly would not be sublated by the cognition arrived at by inference that there\nis a succession of different flames. Wherever there is a conflict between\ncognitions based on two different means of knowledge we assign the position of\nthe \'sublated one\' to that which admits of being accounted for in some other\nway; while that cognition which affords no opening for being held\nunauthoritative and cannot be accounted for in another way, is the \'sublating\none 1.\' This is the principle on which the relation between \'what sublates\'\nand \'what is sublated\' is decided everywhere. Now apprehension of Brahman--\nwhich is mere intelligence, eternal, pure, free, self-luminous--is effected by\nScripture which rests on endless unbroken tradition, cannot therefore be\nsuspected of any, even the least, imperfection, and hence cannot be non-\nauthoritative; the state of bondage, on the other hand, with its manifold\ndistinctions is proved by Perception, Inference, and so on, which are capable\nof imperfections and therefore may be non-authoritative. It is therefore\nreasonable to conclude that the state of bondage is put an end to by the\napprehension of Brahman. And that imperfection of which Perception--through\nwhich we apprehend a world of manifold distinctions--may be assumed to be\ncapable, is so-called Nescience, which consists in the beginningless wrong\nimagination of difference.--Well then--a further objection is raised--let us\nadmit that Scripture is perfect because\n\np. 26\n\nresting on an endless unbroken tradition; but must we then not admit that\ntexts evidently presupposing the view of duality, as e.g. \'Let him who desires\nthe heavenly world offer the _G_ yotish _t_ oma-sacrifice\'--are liable to\nrefutation?--True, we reply. As in the case of the Udgat _ri_ and Pratihart\n_ri_ breaking the chain (not at the same time, but) in succession 1, so here\nalso the earlier texts (which refer to duality and transitory rewards) are\nsublated by the later texts which teach final release, and are not themselves\nsublated by anything else.\n\n#### The texts which represent Brahman as devoid of qualities have greater\nforce\n\nThe same reasoning applies to those passages in the Vedanta-texts which\ninculcate meditation on the qualified Brahman, since the highest Brahman is\nwithout any qualities.--But consider such passages as \'He who cognises all,\nwho knows all\' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); \'His high power is revealed as manifold, as\nessential, acting as force and knowledge\' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 8); \'He whose\nwishes are true, whose purposes are true\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 5); how can\nthese passages, which clearly aim at defining the nature of Brahman, be liable\nto refutation?--Owing to the greater weight, we reply, of those texts which\nset forth Brahman as devoid of qualities. \'It is not coarse, not fine, not\nshort, not long\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 8); \'The True, knowledge, infinite is\nBrahman\' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); \'That which is free from qualities,\' \'that which\nis free from stain\'--these and similar texts convey the notion of Brahman\nbeing changeless, eternal intelligence devoid of all difference; while the\nother texts--quoted before--teach the qualified Brahman. And there being a\nconflict between the two sets of passages, we--according to the Mima _m_ sa\nprinciple referred to above--decide that the texts referring to Brahman as\ndevoid of qualities are of greater force, because they are later in\n\np. 27\n\nolder 1 than those which speak of Brahman as having qualities. Thus everything\nis settled.\n\n#### The text Taitt. Up. II, 1 refers to Brahman as devoid of qualities.\n\nBut--an objection is raised--even the passage \'The True, knowledge, infinite\nis Brahman\' intimates certain qualities of Brahman, viz. true being,\nknowledge, infinity!--Not so, we reply. From the circumstance that all the\nterms of the sentence stand in co-ordination, it follows that they convey the\nidea of one matter (sense) only. If against this you urge that the sentence\nmay convey the idea of one matter only, even if directly expressing a thing\ndistinguished by several qualities; we must remark that you display an\nignorance of the meaning of language which appears to point to some\nweakmindedness on your part. A sentence conveys the idea of one matter (sense)\nonly when all its constitutive words denote one and the same thing; if, on the\nothcr hand, it expresses a thing possessing several attributes, the difference\nof these attributes necessarily leads to a difference in meaning on the part\nof the individual words, and then the oneness of meaning of the sentence is\nlost.--But from your view of the passage it would follow that the several\nwords are mere synonyms!--Give us your attention, we reply, and learn that\nseveral words may convey one meaning without being idle synonyms. From the\ndetermination of the unity of purport of the whole sentence 2 we conclude that\nthe several words, applied to one thing, aim at expressing what is opposite in\nnature to whatever is contrary to the meanings of the several words, and that\nthus they have meaning and unity of meaning and yet are not mere synonyms. The\ndetails\n\np. 28\n\nare as follows. Brahman is to be defined as what is contrary in nature to all\nother things. Now whatever is opposed to Brahman is virtually set aside by the\nthree words (constituting the definition of Brahman in the Taittiriya-text).\nThe word \'true\' (or \'truly being\') has the purport of distinguishing Brahman\nfrom whatever things have no truth, as being the abodes of change; the word\n\'knowledge\' distinguishes Brahman from all non-sentient things whose light\ndepends on something else (which are not self-luminous); and the word\n\'infinite\' distinguishes it from whatever is limited in time or space or\nnature. Nor is this \'distinction\' some positive or negative attribute of\nBrahman, it rather is just Brahman itself as opposed to everything else; just\nas the distinction of white colour from black and other colours is just the\ntrue nature of white, not an attribute of it. The three words constituting the\ntext thus _have_ a meaning, have _one_ meaning, and are non-synonymous, in so\nfar as they convey the essential distinction of one thing, viz. Brahman from\neverything else. The text thus declares the one Brahman which is self-luminous\nand free from all difference. On this interpretation of the text we discern\nits oneness in purport with other texts, such as \'Being only this was in the\nbeginning, one only, without a second.\' Texts such as \'That from whence these\nbeings are born\' (Taitt. Up. III, 1); \'Being only this was in the beginning\' (\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 1); \'Self alone was this in the beginning\' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4,\n1), &c., describe Brahman as the cause of the world; and of this Brahman the\nTaittiriya passage \'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman\' gives the strict\ndefinition.\n\nIn agreement with the principle that all _s_ akhas teach the same doctrine we\nhave to understand that, in all the texts which speak of Brahman as cause,\nBrahman must be taken as being \'without a second\', i.e. without any other\nbeing of the same or a different kind; and the text which aims at defining\nBrahman has then to be interpreted in accordance with this characteristic of\nBrahman, viz. its being without a second. The statement of the _Kh_ andogya\n\np. 29\n\nas to Brahman being without a second must also be taken to imply that Brahman\nis non-dual as far as qualities are concerned; otherwise it would conflict\nwith those passages which speak of Brahman as being without qualities and\nwithout stain. We therefore conclude that the defining Taittiriya-text teaches\nBrahman to be an absolutely homogeneous substance.\n\nBut, the above explanation of the passage being accepted, it follows that the\nwords \'true being,\' \'knowledge,\' &c., have to be viewed as abandoning their\ndirect sense, and merely suggesting a thing distinct in nature from all that\nis opposite (to what the three words directly denote), and this means that we\nresort to so-called implication (implied meaning, laksha _n_ a)!--What\nobjection is there to such a proceeding? we reply. The force of the general\npurport of a sentence is greater than that of the direct denotative power of\nthe simple terms, and it is generally admitted that the purport of grammatical\nco-ordination is oneness (of the matter denoted by the terms co-ordinated).--\nBut we never observe that all words of a sentence are to be understood in an\nimplied sense!--Is it then not observed, we reply, that _one_ word is to be\ntaken in its implied meaning if otherwise it would contradict the purport of\nthe whole sentence? And if the purport of the sentence, which is nothing but\nan aggregate of words employed together, has once been ascertained, why should\nwe not take two or three or all words in an implied sense--just as we had\ntaken one--and thus make them fit in with the general purport? In agreement\nherewith those scholars who explain to us the sense of imperative sentences,\nteach that in imperative sentences belonging to ordinary speech all words have\nan implied meaning only (not their directly denotative meaning). For, they\nmaintain, imperative forms have their primary meaning only in (Vedic)\nsentences which enjoin something not established by other means; and hence in\nordinary speech the effect of the action is conveyed by implication only. The\nother words also, which form part of those imperative sentences and denote\nmatters connected with the action, have their primary meaning\n\np. 30\n\nonly if connected with an action not established by other means; while if\nconnected with an ordinary action they have a secondary, implied, meaning only\n1.\n\n#### Perception reveals to us non-differenced substance only\n\nWe have so far shown that in the case of a conflict between Scripture and\nPerception and the other instruments of knowledge, Scripture is of greater\nforce. The fact, however, is that no such conflict is observed to exist, since\nPerception itself gives rise to the apprehension of a non-differenced Brahman\nwhose nature is pure Being.--But how can it be said that Perception, which has\nfor its object things of various kinds--and accordingly expresses itself in\njudgments such as \'Here is a jar,\' \'There is a piece of cloth\'--causes the\napprehension of mere Being? If there were no apprehension of difference, all\ncognitions would have one and the same object, and therefore would give rise\nto one judgment only--as takes place when one unbroken perceptional cognition\nis continued for some time.--True. We therefore have to enquire in what way,\n\np. 31\n\nin the judgment \'here is a jar,\' an assertion is made about being as well as\nsome special form of being. These implied judgments cannot both be founded on\nperception, for they are the results of acts of cognition occupying different\nmoments of time, while the perceptional cognition takes place in one moment\n(is instantaneous). We therefore must decide whether it is the essential\nnature of the jar, or its difference from other things, that is the object of\nperception. And we must adopt the former alternative, because the apprehension\nof difference presupposes the apprehension of the essential nature of the\nthing, and, in addition, the remembrance of its counterentities (i.e. the\nthings from which the given thing differs). Hence difference is not\napprehended by Perception; and all judgments and propositions relative to\ndifference are founded on error only.\n\n#### Difference--bheda--does not admit of logical definition\n\nThe Logicians, moreover, are unable to give a definition of such a thing as\n\'difference.\' Difference cannot in the first place be the essential nature (of\nthat which differs); for from that it would follow that on the apprehension of\nthe essential nature of a thing there would at once arise not only the\njudgment as to that essential nature but also judgments as to its difference\nfrom everything else.--But, it may be objected to this, even when the\nessential nature of a thing is apprehended, the judgment \'this thing is\ndifferent from other things\' depends on the remembrance of its\ncounterentities, and as long as this remembrance does not take place so long\nthe judgment of difference is not formed!--Such reasoning, we reply, is\ninadmissible. He who maintains that \'difference\' is nothing but \'essential\nnature\' has no right to assume a dependence on counterentities since,\naccording to him, essential nature and difference are the same, i.e. nothing\nbut essential nature: the judgment of difference can, on his view, depend on\ncounterentities no more than the judgment of essential nature does. His view\nreally implies that the two words \'the jar\' and \'different\' (in the judgment\n\'the jar is different\') are\n\np. 32\n\nsynonymous, just as the words \'hasta\' and \'kara\' are (both of which mean\n\'hand\').\n\nNor, in the second place, can \'difference\' be held to be an attribute\n(dharma). For if it were that, we should have to assume that \'difference\'\npossesses difference (i.e. is different) from essential nature; for otherwise\nit would be the same as the latter. And this latter difference would have to\nbe viewed as an attribute of the first difference, and this would lead us on\nto a third difference, and so in infinitum. And the view of \'difference\' being\nan attribute would further imply that difference is apprehended on the\napprehension of a thing distinguished by attributes such as generic character\nand so on, and at the same time that the thing thus distinguished is\napprehended on the apprehension of difference; and this would constitute a\nlogical seesaw.--\'Difference\' thus showing itself incapable of logical\ndefinition, we are confirmed in our view that perception reveals mere \'Being\'\nonly.\n\nMoreover, it appears that in states of consciousness such as \'Here is a jar,\'\n\'There is a piece of cloth,\' \'The jar is perceived,\' \'The piece of cloth is\nperceived,\' that which constitutes the things is Being (existence; satta) and\nperception (or \'consciousness\'; anubhuti). And we observe that it is pure\nBeing only which persists in all states of cognition: this pure Being alone,\ntherefore, is _real_. The differences, on the other hand, which do not\npersist, are unreal. The case is analogous to that of the snake-rope. The rope\nwhich persists as a substrate is real, while the non-continuous things (which\nby wrong imagination are superimposed on the rope) such as a snake, a cleft in\nthe ground, a watercourse, and so on, are unreal.\n\nBut--our adversary objects--the instance is not truly analogous. In the case\nof the snake-rope the non-reality of the snake results from the snake\'s being\nsublated (badhita) by the cognition of the true nature of the substrate \'This\nis a rope, not a snake\'; it does not result from the non-continuousness of the\nsnake. In the same way the reality of the rope does not follow from its\npersistence, but from the fact of its being not sublated (by another\n\np. 33\n\ncognition). But what, we ask, establishes the non-reality of jars and pieces\nof cloth?--All are agreed, we reply, that we observe, in jars and similar\nthings, individual difference (vyav _ri_ tti, literally \'separation,\'\n\'distinction\'). The point to decide is of what nature such difference is. Does\nit not mean that the judgment \'This is a jar\' implies the negation of pieces\nof cloth and other things? But this means that by this judgment pieces of\ncloth and other things are sublated (badhita). Individual difference (vyav\n_ri_ tti) thus means the cessation (or absence), due to sublation, of certain\nobjects of cognition, and it proves the non-reality of whatever has non-\ncontinuous existence; while on the other hand, pure Being, like the rope,\npersists non-sublated. Hence everything that is additional to pure Being is\nnon-real.--This admits of being expressed in technical form. \'Being\' is real\nbecause it persists, as proved by the case of the rope in the snake-rope; jars\nand similar things are non-real because they are non-continuous, as proved by\nthe case of the snake that has the rope for its substrate.\n\nFrom all this it follows that persisting consciousness only has real being; it\nalone is.\n\n#### Being and consciousness are one. Consciousness is svaya _m_ prakasa.\n\nBut, our adversary objects, as mere Being is the object of consciousness, it\nis different therefrom (and thus there exists after all \'difference\' or\n\'plurality\').--Not so, we reply. That there is no such thing as \'difference,\'\nwe have already shown above on the grounds that it is not the object of\nperception, and moreover incapable of definition. It cannot therefore be\nproved that \'Being\' is the object of consciousness. Hence Consciousness itself\nis \'Being\'--that which is.--This consciousness is self-proved, just because it\nis consciousness. Were it proved through something else, it would follow that\nlike jars and similar things it is not consciousness. Nor can there be\nassumed, for consciousness, the need of another act of consciousness (through\nwhich its knowledge would be established); for\n\np. 34\n\nit shines forth (praka _s_ ate) through its own being. While it exists,\nconsciousness--differing therein from jars and the like--is never observed not\nto shine forth, and it cannot therefore be held to depend, in its shining\nforth, on something else.--You (who object to the above reasoning) perhaps\nhold the following view:--even when consciousness has arisen, it is the object\nonly which shines forth--a fact expressed in sentences such as: the jar is\nperceived. When a person forms the judgment \'This is a jar,\' he is not at the\ntime conscious of a consciousness which is not an object and is not of a\ndefinite character. Hence the existence of consciousness is the reason which\nbrings about the \'shining forth\' of jars and other objects, and thus has a\nsimilar office as the approximation of the object to the eye or the other\norgans of sense (which is another condition of perceptive consciousness).\nAfter this the existence of consciousness is inferred on the ground that the\nshining forth of the object is (not permanent, but) occasional only 1. And\nshould this argumentation be objected to on the ground of its implying that\nconsciousness--which is essentially of the nature of intelligence--is\nsomething non-intelligent like material things, we ask you to define this\nnegation of non-intelligence (which you declare to be characteristic of\nconsciousness). Have we, perhaps, to understand by it the invariable\nconcomitance of existence and shining forth? If so, we point out that this\ninvariable concomitance is also found in the case of pleasure and similar\naffections; for when pleasure and so on exist at all, they never are non-\nperceived (i.e. they exist in so far only as we are conscious of them). It is\nthus clear that we have no consciousness of consciousness itself--just as the\ntip of a finger, although touching other things, is incapable of touching\nitself.\n\nAll this reasoning, we reply, is entirely spun out of your own fancy, without\nany due consideration of the power of consciousness. The fact is, that in\nperceiving colour and\n\np. 35\n\nother qualities of things, we are not aware of a \'shining forth\' as an\nattribute of those things, and as something different from consciousness; nor\ncan the assumption of an attribute of things called \'light,\' or \'shining\nforth,\' be proved in any way, since the entire empirical world itself can be\nproved only through consciousness, the existence of which we both admit.\nConsciousness, therefore, is not something which is inferred or proved through\nsome other act of knowledge; but while proving everything else it is proved by\nitself. This may be expressed in technical form as follows--Consciousness is,\nwith regard to its attributes and to the empirical judgments concerning it,\nindependent of any other thing, because through its connexion with other\nthings it is the cause of their attributes and the empirical judgments\nconcerning them. For it is a general principle that of two things that which\nthrough its connexion with the other is the cause of the attributes of--and\nthe empirical judgments about--the latter, is itself independent of that other\nas to those two points. We see e.g. that colour, through its conjunction with\nearth and the like, produces in them the quality of visibility, but does not\nitself depend for its visibility on conjunction with colour. Hence\nconsciousness is itself the cause of its own \'shining forth,\' as well as of\nthe empirically observed shining forth of objects such as jars and the like.\n\n#### Consciousness is eternal and incapable of change.\n\nThis self-luminous consciousness, further, is eternal, for it is not capable\nof any form of non-existence--whether so--called antecedent non-existence or\nany other form. This follows from its being self-established. For the\nantecedent non-existence of self-established consciousness cannot be\napprehended either through consciousness or anything else. If consciousness\nitself gave rise to the apprehension of its own non-existence, it could not do\nso in so far as \'being,\' for that would contradict its being; if it is, i.e.\nif its non-existence is not, how can it give rise to the idea of its non-\nexistence? Nor can it do so if not being; for if consciousness itself is not,\nhow can it furnish\n\np. 36\n\na proof for its own non-existence? Nor can the non- existence of consciousness\nbe apprehended through anything else; for consciousness cannot be the object\nof anything else. Any instrument of knowledge proving the non-existence of\nconsciousness, could do so only by making consciousness its object--\'this is\nconsciousness\'; but consciousness, as being self-established, does not admit\nof that objectivation which is implied in the word \'this,\' and hence its\nprevious non-existence cannot be proved by anything lying outside itself.\n\nAs consciousness thus does not admit of antecedent non-existence, it further\ncannot be held to originate, and hence also all those other states of being\nwhich depend on origination cannot be predicated of it.\n\nAs consciousness is beginningless, it further does not admit of any plurality\nwithin itself; for we observe in this case the presence of something which is\ncontrary to what invariably accompanies plurality (this something being\n\'beginninglessness\' which is contrary to the quality of having a beginning--\nwhich quality invariably accompanies plurality). For we never observe a thing\ncharacterised by plurality to be without a beginning.--And moreover\ndifference, origination, &c., are objects of consciousness, like colour and\nother qualities, and hence cannot be attributes of consciousness. Therefore,\nconsciousness being essentially consciousness only, nothing else that is an\nobject of consciousness can be its attribute. The conclusion is that\nconsciousness is free from difference of any kind.\n\n#### The apparent difference between Consciousness and the conscious subject\nis due to the unreal aha _m_ kara.\n\nFrom this it further follows that there is no substrate of consciousness--\ndifferent from consciousness itself--such as people ordinarily mean when\nspeaking of a \'knower.\' It is self-luminous consciousness itself which\nconstitutes the so-called \'knower.\' This follows therefrom also that\nconsciousness is not non-intelligent ( _g_ a _d_ a); for non-intelligence\ninvariably accompanies absence of Selfhood (anatmatva);\n\np. 37\n\nhence, non-intelligence being absent in consciousness, consciousness is not\nnon-Self, that means, it is the Self.\n\nBut, our adversary again objects, the consciousness which expresses itself in\nthe judgment \' _I_ know,\' proves that the quality of being a \'knower\' belongs\nto consciousness!--By no means, we reply. The attribution to consciousness of\nthis quality rests on error, no less than the attribution, to the shell, of\nthe quality of being silver. Consciousness cannot stand in the relation of an\nagent toward itself: the attribute of being a knowing agent is erroneously\nimputed to it--an error analogous to that expressed in the judgment \'I am a\nman,\' which identifies the Self of a person with the outward aggregate of\nmatter that bears the external characteristics of humanity. To be a \'knower\'\nmeans to be the agent in the action of knowing; and this is something\nessentially changeful and non-intelligent ( _g_ a _d_ a), having its abode in\nthe aha _m_ kara, which is itself a thing subject to change. How, on the other\nhand, could such agency possibly belong to the changeless \'witness\' (of all\nchange, i.e. consciousness) whose nature is pure Being? That agency cannot be\nan attribute of the Self follows therefrom also that, like colour and other\nqualities, agency depends, for its own proof, on seeing, i.e. consciousness.\n\nThat the Self does not fall within the sphere (is not an object of), the idea\nof \'I\' is proved thereby also that in deep sleep, swoon, and similar states,\nthe idea of the \'I\' is absent, while the consciousness of the Self persists.\nMoreover, if the Self were admitted to be an agent and an object of the idea\nof \'I,\' it would be difficult to avoid the conclusion that like the body it is\nnon-intelligent, something merely outward (\'being for others only, not for\nitself\') and destitute of Selfhood. That from the body, which is the object of\nthe idea of \'I,\' and known to be an agent, there is different that Self which\nenjoys the results of the body\'s actions, viz. the heavenly word, and so on,\nis acknowledged by all who admit the validity of the instruments of knowledge;\nanalogously, therefore, we must admit that different from the knower whom we\nunderstand by the term \'I,\' is the \'witnessing\' inward Self. The non-\nintelligent\n\np. 38\n\naha _m_ kara thus merely serves to manifest the nature of non-changing\nconsciousness, and it effects this by being its abode; for it is the proper\nquality of manifesting agents to manifest the objects manifested, in so far as\nthe latter abide in them. A mirror, e.g., or a sheet of water, or a certain\nmass of matter, manifests a face or the disc of the moon (reflected in the\nmirror or water) or the generic character of a cow (impressed on the mass of\nmatter) in so far as all those things abide in them.--In this way, then, there\narises the erroneous view that finds expression in the judgment \'I know.\'--Nor\nmust you, in the way of objection, raise the question how self-luminous\nconsciousness is to be manifested by the non-intelligent aha _m_ kara, which\nrather is itself manifested by consciousness; for we observe that the surface\nof the hand, which itself is manifested by the rays of sunlight falling on it,\nat the same time manifests those rays. This is clearly seen in the case of\nrays passing through the interstices of network; the light of those rays is\nintensified by the hand on which they fall, and which at the same time is\nitself manifested by the rays.\n\nIt thus appears that the \'knowing agent,\' who is denoted by the \'I,\' in the\njudgment \'I know,\' constitutes no real attribute of the Self, the nature of\nwhich is pure intelligence. This is also the reason why the consciousness of\nEgoity does not persist in the states of deep sleep and final release: in\nthose states this special form of consciousness passes away, and the Self\nappears in its true nature, i.e. as pure consciousness. Hence a person who has\nrisen from deep, dreamless sleep reflects, \'Just now I was unconscious of\nmyself.\'\n\n#### Summing up of the purvapaksha view.\n\nAs the outcome of all this, we sum up our view as follows.--Eternal,\nabsolutely non-changing consciousness, whose nature is pure non-differenced\nintelligence, free from all distinction whatever, owing to error illusorily\nmanifests itself (vivarttate) as broken up into manifold distinctions--knowing\nsubjects, objects of knowledge, acts of knowledge.\n\np. 39\n\n[paragraph continues] And the purpose for which we enter on the consideration\nof the Vedanta-texts is utterly to destroy what is the root of that error,\ni.e. Nescience, and thus to obtain a firm knowledge of the oneness of Brahman,\nwhose nature is mere intelligence--free, pure, eternal.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[22:1](sbe48007.htm#fr_2) In agreement with the use made of this passage by\nthe Purvapakshin, vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana must here be understood in the sense of avidya.\nVi _g \xc3\xb1_anasabdena vividha _m_ _g \xc3\xb1_ayate-neneti kara _n_ avyutpattya-vidya-\nbhidhiyate. _S_ ru.

To Perception the flame, as long as it burns, seems one and the\nsame: but on the ground of the observation that the different particles of the\nwick and the oil are consumed in succession, we infer that there are many\ndistinct flames succeeding one another. And we accept the Inference as valid,\nand as sublating or refuting the immediate perception, because the perceived\noneness of the flame admits of being accounted for \'otherwise,\' viz. on the\nground of the many distinct flames originating in such rapid succession that\nthe eye mistakes them for one. The inference on the other hand does not admit\nof being explained in another way.\n\n[26:1](sbe48007.htm#fr_4) The reference is to the point discussed Pu. Mi. Su.\nVI, 5, 54 ( _G_ aim. Nya.

The imperative forms of the verb have their primary meaning,\ni.e. the power of originating action, only in Vedic sentences which enjoin the\nperformance of certain actions for the bringing about of certain ends: no\nother means of knowledge but the Veda informing us that such ends can be\naccomplished by such actions. Nobody, e.g. would offer a soma sacrifice in\norder to obtain the heavenly world, were he not told by the Veda to do so. In\nordinary life, on the other hand, no imperative possesses this entirely unique\noriginative force, since any action which may be performed in consequence of a\ncommand may be prompted by other motives as well: it is, in technical Indian\nlanguage, established already, apart from the command, by other means of\nknowledge. The man who, e.g. is told to milk a cow might have proceeded to do\nso, apart from the command, for reasons of his own. Imperatives in ordinary\nspeech are therefore held not to have their primary meaning, and this\nconclusion is extended, somewhat unwarrantably one should say, to all the\nwords entering into an imperative clause.\n\n[34:1](sbe48007.htm#fr_8) Being not permanent but occasional, it is an effect\nonly, and as such must have a cause.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Great Siddhanta.](sbe48008.htm)\n\n'
