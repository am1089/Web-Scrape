He was born in Manu's firm law [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:1:1), the Hot\n_ri_ , the best sacrificer, according to the will of the U _s_ i _g_ s\n[2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:1:2), Agni, according to his own will. Always\nlistening to him who wishes to be his friend, like a treasure to him who\naspires to renown, the unbeguiled Hot _ri_ sat down in the abode of food (on\nthe altar); enveloped [3](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:1:3) (he sat down) in the\nabode of food.\n\n2\\. We render him attentive [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:2:1), the promoter of\nsacrifice, on the path of _Ri_ ta, by adoration with offerings, in the divine\nworld, by (adoration) with offerings  [2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:2:2). In\nbringing us vigour he never becomes worn out with this body of his: he whom\nMatari _s_ van (has brought) to Manu from afar, the god whom he has brought\nfrom afar.\n\n3\\. In his (own) way he moves in one moment round the terrestrial (space), the\nsudden devourer (emitting) his sperm, the bellowing bull emitting his sperm,\nthe bellower [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:3:1), looking round with a hundred\neyes, the god who quickly courses in the forests\n[2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:3:2), taking his seat on the lower ridges, Agni, and\non the highest ridges.\n\n4\\. This highly wise Purohita, Agni watches sacrifice and service\n[1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:4:1) house by house; by (the power of) his mind he\nis intent upon sacrifice. By (the power of) his mind helpful to him who\ndesires food [2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:4:2), he looks on all creatures, since\nhe has been born, the guest adorned with ghee, (since) the helpful carrier (of\nthe gods) [3](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:4:3) has been born.\n\np. 138\n\n5\\. When through his (Agni's) power the bounties grow in strength, with the\nroar of Agni [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:5:1) as with that of the Maruts\n[2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:5:2)--like bounties offered to a vigorous man: then\nhe by his greatness stirs up the gift of goods. May he protect us from\nmisfortune and injury, from evil spell and injury.\n\n6\\. The far-reaching [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:1) steward\n[2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:2) has taken all goods\n[3](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:3) in his right hand, and strongly advancing does\nnot let them loose; desirous of glory he does not let them loose. For every\nsupplicant [4](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:4) thou hast carried the oblations to\nthe gods [5](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:5). For every righteous one he procures a\ntreasure; Agni opens both folds of the door (for him).\n\n7\\. He has been established as the most blissful one in the enclosures of men,\nAgni, at the sacrifices, like a noble lord of the clans, a beloved lord of the\nclans at the sacrifices: he rules over the oblations of men to which\nnourishing power has been imparted [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:7:1). May he\nprotect us from harm that comes from Varu _n_ a, from harm\n[2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:7:2) that comes from the great god.\n\n8\\. They magnify Agni the Hot _ri_ , the dispenser of goods. They have roused\nthe beloved, the most shining steward [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:8:1) (of\nsacrifice); they have roused the carrier of oblations. The gods desirous of\ngoods (have roused) him in whom all life dwells, who possesses all wealth, the\nHot _ri_ , the worshipful sage, the lovely one for the sake of bliss; with\npraises (they have roused), desirous of goods, the lovely one.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 6 = TB. II, 5, 4, 4.\n\np. 139\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. As to dharima _n_ i, comp. IX, 86, 4, where it is said that the\nstreams of Soma flow forward, 'dharima _n_ i;' Bergaigne, III, 219. 'Domain,\nprecinct, sanctuary?' M. M.\n\nNote 2. The U _s_ i _g_ as (comp. above, I, 60, 2, note 1) are closely related\nto the Bh _ri_ gus; they are considered as the first sacrificers, the first\nworshippers of Agni. See Bergaigne, I, 57 seq.\n\nNote 3. Enveloped in fuel and libations.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. M. M.'s note, vol. xxxii, p. 437.\n\nNote 2. Comp. Lanman, pp. 516, 518.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Prof. Max Muller translates the second and third Padas: 'again and\nagain shouting, bellowing forth his sperm, yea, placing his sperm with\nbellowing.'\n\nNote 2. Of course the fuel is alluded to.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya adhvarasya, 'sacrifice and service;' comp. above, I,\n1, 4, note 1.\n\nNote 2. The translation is doubtful. If the denominative ishuy is derived from\nishu, the meaning must be 'to fly like an arrow,' or possibly 'to shoot\narrows.' But I do not think that the poet can have meant to say that Agni acts\nas a vedha\xc2\xb4 _h_ and looks on all creatures 'for him who flies like an arrow,'\nor 'for him who shoots arrows.' We should rather have to write ishuyate\nwithout accent, so that the translation would be: 'By (the power of) his mind\nhelpful (Agni) flies like an arrow; he looks on all creatures' (comp. VI, 3,\n5, where it is said that Agni shoots arrows). But possibly ishuy, which is\nfound only here, may be a synonym of ishudhy, see verse 6. It may be a\ndenominative from ish, influenced by the type of verbs like _ri_ _g_ uy,\nkratuy,\n\np. 140\n\nvasuy, &c. Then the accent can be retained, and the translation would be as\ngiven in the text ('to him who desires food').\n\nNote 3. On vahni, comp. above, I, 127, 8, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The cerebral _n_ in ave _n_ a clearly points to the correction of the\ntext agne _h_ rave _n_ a.\n\nNote 2. The Maruts are called bho _g_ a\xc2\xb4 _h_ , V, 53, 16 (stuhi bho _g_ a\xc2\xb4n,\n'praise the liberal ones'). Here we have the corresponding abstract noun.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Vihayas (comp. Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, III, 287) seems to be\nformed like vimahas, vi _k_ etas, vimanas. The meaning then will be 'of\nextended hayas.' The substantive hayas, which is not found in the texts\nseparately, may be derived from _g_ ihite or from hinoti, and mean something\nlike 'energy.' At all events it seems impossible to connect this adjective\nvihayas with the substantive vihayas, 'the aerial space,' belonging to the\nclassical language.\n\nNote 2. Comp. the remark above, I, 58, 7, note 2.\n\nNote 3. I propose to read vi _s_ va vi-haya _h_ arati _h_ vasu dadhe haste\ndakshi _n_ e. Comp. IX, 18, 4. a\xc2\xb4 ya _h_ vi _s_ vani va\xc2\xb4rya vasuni hastayo _h_\ndadhe.\n\nNote 4. Comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 191.\n\nNote 5. Comp. VIII, 19, 1. devatra\xc2\xb4 havyam ohire.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. I _l_ a\xc2\xb4 k _ri_ ta seems to be identical with ishk _ri_ ta.\n\nNote 2. Regarding the metre, comp. Lanman, p. 383.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Comp. I, 58, 7, note 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 140](sbe46038.htm)\n\n"
