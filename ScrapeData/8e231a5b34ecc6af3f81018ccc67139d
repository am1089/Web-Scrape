Come hither, do not fail, when you march forward! Do not stay away, O\nunited friends, you who can bend even what is firm.\n\n2\\. O Maruts, _Ri_ bhukshans, come hither on your flaming strong fellies\n[1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:2:1), O Rudras, come to us to-day with food, you much-\ndesired ones, come to the sacrifice, you friends of the Sobharis\n[2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:2:2).\n\n3\\. For we know indeed the terrible strength of the sons of Rudra, of the\nvigorous Maruts, the liberal givers [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:3:1) of Soma\n[2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:3:2) (rain).\n\n4\\. The islands (clouds) were scattered, but the monster remained\n[1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:4:1), heaven and earth were joined together. O you who\nare armed with bright rings, the tracts (of the sky)\n[2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:4:2) expanded, whenever you stir, radiant with your\nown splendour.\n\n5\\. Even things that cannot be thrown down resound at your race, the\nmountains, the lord of the forest,--the earth quivers on your marches.\n\n6\\. The upper sky makes wide room, to let your violence pass, O Maruts, when\nthese strong-armed heroes display their energies in their own bodies.\n\n7\\. According to their wont these men, exceeding terrible, impetuous, with\nstrong and unbending forms [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:7:1), bring with them\nbeautiful light [2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:7:2).\n\n8\\. The arrow of the Sobharis is shot from the bowstrings at the golden chest\non the chariot of the Maruts [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:8:1). They, the kindred\nof the cow (P _ri_ _s_ ni),\n\np. 401\n\nthe well-born, should enjoy their food, the great ones should help us.\n\n9\\. Bring forward, O strongly-anointed [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:9:1) (priests),\nyour libations to the strong host of the Maruts, the strongly advancing.\n\n10\\. O Maruts, O heroes, come quickly hither, like winged hawks, on your\nchariot with strong horses, of strong shape, with strong naves, to enjoy our\nlibations.\n\n11\\. Their anointing is the same, the golden chains shine on their arms, their\nspears sparkle.\n\n12\\. These strong, manly, strong-armed Maruts, do not strive among themselves;\nfirm are the bows, the weapons on your chariot, and on your faces are\nsplendours.\n\n13\\. They whose terrible name [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:13:1), wide-spreading\nlike the ocean, is the one of all that is of use, whose strength is like the\nvigour of their father,\n\n14\\. Worship these Maruts, and praise them! Of these shouters, as of moving\nspokes [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:14:1), no one is the last; this is theirs by\ngift, by greatness [2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:14:2) is it theirs.\n\n15\\. Happy is he who was under your protection, O Maruts, in former mornings,\nor who may be so even now.\n\n16\\. Or he, O men, whose libations you went to enjoy; that mighty one, O\nshakers, will obtain your favours with brilliant riches and booty.\n\n17\\. As the sons of Rudra, the servants of the divine Dyu\n[1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:17:1), win it, O youths, so shall it be.\n\n18\\. Whatever liberal givers may worship [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:18:1) the\nMaruts, and move about together as generous [2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:18:2)\nbenefactors, even from them turn [3](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:18:3) towards us with\na kinder heart, you youths\n\n19\\. O Sobhari, call loud with your newest song\n\np. 402\n\nthe young, strong, and pure Maruts, as the plougher calls the cows.\n\n20\\. Worship the Maruts with a song, they who are strong like a boxer, called\nin to assist those who call [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:20:1) for him in all\nfights; (worship them) the most glorious, like bright-shining bulls.\n\n21\\. Yes, O united friends, kindred, O Maruts, by a common birth, the oxen\nlick one another's humps [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:21:1).\n\n22\\. O ye dancers, with golden ornaments on your chests, even a mortal comes\n(to ask) for your brotherhood [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:22:1); take care of us,\nye Maruts, for your friendship lasts for ever.\n\n23\\. O bounteous Maruts, bring us some of your Marut-medicine, you friends,\nand (quick, like) steeds.\n\n24\\. With the favours whereby you favour the Sindhu, whereby you save, whereby\nyou help Krivi [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:24:1), with those propitious favours be\nour delight, O delightful ones, ye who never hate your followers\n[2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:24:2).\n\n25\\. O Maruts, for whom we have prepared good altars, whatever medicine\n[1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:25:1) there is on the Sindhu, on the Asikni, in the\nseas, on the mountains,\n\n26\\. Seeing it, you carry it all on your bodies. Bless us with it! Down to the\nearth, O Maruts [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:26:1), what hurts our sick one,--\nstraighten what is crooked!\n\np. 403\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Sobhari Ka _n_ va; metre, Kakubha pragatha. Verse 1 = SV. I, 401;\nverse 21 = SV. I, 404.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nSV. reads sthata, and d _ri_ _dh_ a _k_ id yamayish _n_ ava _h_.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. It might be better to supply rathai _h_ , but the poet may have used\npars pro toto.\n\nNote 2. The Sobharis, who are mentioned in the 8th Ma _n_ _d_ ala only, are\nclearly a clan of that name, and their hymns form a small collection by\nitself. See Oldenberg. Prolegomena, p. 209 seq.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Mi _lh_ vas is sometimes used by itself in the sense of patron or\nbenefactor, VII, 86, 7; 97, 2. Whether it can govern a genitive is doubtful,\nbut see VII, 58, 5, note.\n\nNote 2. Here again, as in II, 34, 11, Vish _n_ u esha seems to mean Soma,\npossibly the food, or even the seed (retas) of Vish _n_ u. Saya _n_ a too\ntakes Vish _n_ u as a name of rain. In I, 154, 5, we read that the spring of\nmadhu is in the highest place of Vish _n_ u. Could it mean the generous sons\nof Vish _n_ u?\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. My translation is purely conjectural. I take dvipa for isolated or\nscattered clouds, different from the du _k_ _kh_ una, which I take for the\nblack mass of storm-clouds, threatening destruction. Grassmann: 'Die\nWolkeninseln stoben and das Unheil floh.' Ludwig: 'Empor stigen gewaltig die\nwaszerinseln, still stand das ungluck.'\n\nNote 2. The coming together of heaven and earth and their apparent widening\nhave been ascribed to the Maruts before. It seems hardly possible to translate\ndhanvani here by bows. I take it for the wide expanse, as if the desert, of\nthe sky.\n\np. 404\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. On psu in v _ri_ shapsu, see note to VIII, 7, 7.\n\nNote 2. Possibly _s_ riyam vahante has to be taken like _s_ ubham ya, see\nGaedicke, Accusativ, p. 163.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. In support of the translation which I proposed in I, 85, 10, note 2,\nall I can say is that a _g_ is a verb used for shooting forth an arrow, see I,\n112, 16, and that vana may be used in the sense of ba _n_ a, reed and arrow,\nand that go is used for bowstring, see B.-R. s. v. The question, however,\narises, how does this verse come in here? How does the fact that the Sobharis,\nwho are praising the storm-gods, shoot their arrow at the golden chest on\ntheir chariot, agree with what precedes and follows?\n\nLet us look first whether a more natural translation can be found. B.-R.\ntranslate: 'The sacrificial music of the Sobharis is furnished and therefore\nmade more attractive by draughts of milk (or animal food).' In order to\nsupport such a translation, it should be proved, first, that va _n_ a ever\nmeans sacrificial music, and that such sacrificial music can be spoken of as a\n_g_ yate (it is furnished), gobhi _h_ (by milk-draughts). Grassmann\ntranslates: 'Durch Milchtrank wird der Sobharis Musik belohnt.' Here again it\nmust be proved that va _n_ a can mean sacrificial music, and a _g_ yate, it is\nrewarded. Ludwig translates: 'Mit der milch wird gesalbt den Sobhari der\nzapfen am wagen am goldnen korbe.' This is explained to mean that 'the bolt on\nthe chariot of the Maruts is to be greased with milk, so that the milk may\nstream down on the Sobharis.' I doubt whether va _n_ a can mean bolt, and I do\nnot see that the intention of the poet, namely to ask for rain, would be\nconveyed by such words.\n\nSaya _n_ a interprets: 'Through the cows, i. e. the hymns, of the Sobharis the\nlyre of the Maruts is made evident;' or; 'by the cows, i. e. the Maruts, the\nlyre is manifested for the sake of the Sobharis.'\n\nIn support of my own translation I can only appeal to a\n\np. 405\n\ncustom ascribed by Herodotus (IV, 94) to another ancient Aryan tribe, namely\nthe Thracians, who, when there is thunder and lightning, shoot arrows against\nthe sky. Herodotus in trying to find a motive for this says they do it to\nthreaten the god. because they believe in no other god, but their own. This\nmay be so; the only question is whether in shooting their arrows against the\nsky, they hoped to drive the clouds away, or wished them to give up their\ntreasure, namely the rain. I should feel inclined to take the latter view, but\nin either case we see that what the Thracians did, was exactly what the\nSobharis are said to do here, namely to shoot an arrow at the golden chest or\ntreasure on the chariot of the Maruts. This is, of course. no more than a\nconjecture, and I shall gladly give it up, if a more appropriate meaning can\nbe elicited from this line. What is against it is the frequent occurrence of a\n_\xc3\xb1_ _g_ with gobhi _h_ in the sense of covering with milk, see IX, 45, 3: V,\n3, 2, &c. As to rathe ko _s_ e hira _n_ yaye, see VIII, 22, 9.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. V _ri_ shad-a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya _h_ for v _ri_ sha _n_ -a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya _h_ ,\nsee J. Schmidt, K. Z. XXVI, 358. It cannot mean 'raining down ointments,' as\nGrassmann supposes, because that would be varshad-a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya _h_ , if it\nexisted at all. Besides. the a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ is are never poured down, nor are they\nsacrificial viands. The repetition of the word v _ri_ shan is intentional. and\nhas been discussed before.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. Naman is, of course, more than the mere name; but name can be used in\nmuch the same sense.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. The simile of the aras, as in V, 58, 5, seems to require another\nnegative.\n\nNote 2. See V, 87, 2, on dana\xc2\xb4 and mahna\xc2\xb4.\n\n##### Verse 17.\n\nNote 1. On diva _h_ asurasya vedhasa _h_ , see von Bradke. Dyaus Asura, pp. 44\nand 46. It should be remembered,\n\np. 406\n\nhowever, that vedhas and medhas interchange. Thus in RV. IX, 102, 4, we have\nvedha\xc2\xb4m, in SV. I, 101, medha\xc2\xb4m. On medhas, the Zend mazda, see Darmesteter,\nOrmazd, p. 29. I take servant in the sense of worshipper, from vidh.\n\n##### Verse 18.\n\nNote 1. Arhanti, in the sense of arhayanti, to worship, seems better than to\nbe worthy of, or to have a right to.\n\nNote 2. Mi _lh_ usha _h_ can be nominative, see Lanman, p. 511; but it may\nalso refer to the Maruts, and then be accusative.\n\nNote 3. Instead of a\xc2\xb4 vav _ri_ dhvam, which Ludwig translates, Nemt uns fur\neuch in besitz, Grassmann translates, Wendet euch zu uns her. He read\ntherefore a\xc2\xb4 vav _ri_ ddhvam, and this, the plural corresponding to a\xc2\xb4 vav\n_ri_ tsva, seems to be the right reading.\n\n##### Verse 20.\n\nNote 1. Grassmann proposes to change p _ri_ tsu hot _ri_ shu into yutsu p _ri_\ntsushu. But may not hot _ri_ shu be used here in a sense corresponding to that\nof havya? Havya has almost the technical meaning of an ally who is to be\ncalled for assistance. Thus IV, 24, 2. sa _h_ v _ri_ trahatye havya _h_ ; VII,\n32, 24. bhare-bhare _k_ a havya _h_ , &c. Now a havya _h_ , one who is called,\npresupposes a hot _ri_ , one who calls for assistance. It is true that hot\n_ri_ , from hu, to pour out, has so completely become a technical name that it\nseems strange to see it used here, in a new etymological sense, as caller. But\nthe connection with havya may justify what may have been meant as a play on\nthe words. Wilson seems to have taken the verse in a similar sense, when he\ntranslates: 'and like a boxer who has been challenged over his challengers.'\nHe, like Ludwig, takes hot _ri_ as a challenger. I prefer to take it as\ncalling for aid. I am not satisfied, however, with either translation, nor\ndoes Grassmann or Ludwig offer anything useful.\n\n##### Verse 21.\n\nNote 1. In the SV. maruta _h_ and rihate have the accent\n\np. 407\n\non the second syllable. Sabandhava _h_ was used before of the Maruts, V, 59,\n5; according to its accent it would here refer to ga\xc2\xb4va _h_. I can see no\nmeaning in this verse except a very naturalistic one, namely that the Maruts,\nwho are described as friends and brothers, as never quarrelling and always of\none mind, are here compared to oxen, grazing in the same field, and so far\nfrom fighting, actually licking the humps on each other's backs.\n\n##### Verse 22.\n\nNote 1. Grassmann, 'geht euch an um eure Bruderschaft;' possibly, 'becomes\nyour brother.'\n\n##### Verse 24.\n\nNote 1. It is, no doubt, very tempting to change tu\xc2\xb4rvatha into turva _s_ am,\nas Ludwig proposes. The difficulty is to understand how such a change should\nhave come about. Sindhu may mean here, not so much the river, as the people\nliving on its shores. Krivi is said to be an old name of the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas (\n_S_ at. Br. XIII, 5, 4, 7). But, because the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas were called\nKrivis, and because in later times we often hear of Kuru-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas, it\ndoes in no way follow that the Krivis were identical with the Kurus. It proves\nrather the contrary. Kuru may be derived from kar, and may have meant active,\nbut it may also have had a very different original meaning. A derivation of\nkrivi from kar is still more objectionable.\n\nNote 2. Asa _k_ advisha _h_ , which I translate by not hating your followers,\nis translated by Ludwig: 'ihr, denen kein haszer folgt.' It may also be\nrendered by hating those who do not follow you.'\n\n##### Verse 25.\n\nNote 1. The medicines are generally brought by Rudra, and by his sons, the\nMaruts.\n\n##### Verse 26.\n\nNote 1. As to kshama\xc2\xb4 rapa _h_ , see X, 59, 8-10; AV VI, 57, 3; as to\nishkarta, VIII, I, 12.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 94. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3252.htm)\n\n"
