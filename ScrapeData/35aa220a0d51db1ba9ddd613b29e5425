One should hold the Self to be different from these three\nvestures.\n\nIn the presence of the five veils, the pure Self seems to share their nature;\nlike a crystal in the presence of blue tissues.\n\nThe pure Self within should be wisely discerned from the veils that surround\nit, as rice by winnowing, from husk and chaff.\n\nThough ever all-present, the Self is not everywhere clearly beheld; let it\nshine forth in pure reason like a reflection in a pure mirror.\n\nThe thought of difference arises through the vestures, the powers, mind,\nreason, and nature; but one must find the Self, the witness of all this being,\nthe perpetual king.\n\nThrough the busy activity of the powers, the Self seems busy; as the moon\nseems to course through the coursing clouds.\n\np. 109\n\nThe vestures, powers, mind, and reason move in their paths under the pure\nconsciousness of the Self, as people move in the sunshine.\n\nThe qualities of vestures, powers, and works are attributed to the spotless\nSelf through undiscernment, as blue to the pure sky.\n\nThrough unwisdom, the mental vesture's actorship is attributed to the Self, as\nthe ripple of the waves to the moon reflected in a lake.\n\nPassion, desire, pleasure, pain move the mind; but when the mind rests in deep\nsleep they cease; they belong to the mind, not to the Self.\n\nShining is the sun's nature; coldness, the water's; heat, the fire's; so the\nSelf's nature is Being, Consciousness, Bliss, perpetual spotlessness.\n\nThe Self lends Being and Consciousness, and mind lends activity. When these\ntwo factors are joined together by undiscernment, there arises the feeling\nthat 'I perceive.'\n\nThe Self never changes; and mind of itself cannot perceive; but the Self\nthrough error believes itself to be the habitual doer and perceiver.\n\nThe Self is believed to be the habitual life, as a rope is believed to be a\nsnake; and thus fear arises. But when it is known that 'I am not the habitual\nlife but the Self' then there can be no more fear.\n\nThe Self alone lights up the mind and powers, as a flame lights up a jar. The\nSelf can never be lit by these dull powers.\n\nIn the knowledge of the Self, there is no need that\n\np. 110\n\nit should be known by anything else. A light does not need another light; it\nshines of itself.\n\nPutting all veils aside, saying 'it is not this! it is not this!' one must\nfind the real unity of the habitual Self and the Supreme Self, according to\nthe words of wisdom.\n\nAll outward things, the vestures and the rest, spring from unwisdom; they are\nfugitive as bubbles. One must find the changeless, spotless 'I am the\nEternal.'\n\nAs I am other than these vestures, not mine are their birth, weariness,\nsuffering, dissolution. I am not bound by sensuous objects, for Self is\nseparate from the powers of sense.\n\nAs I am other than mind, not mine are pain, rage, hate, and fear. The Self is\nabove the outward life and mind, according to the words of wisdom.\n\nFrom this Self come forth the outward life and mind, and all the powers; from\nthe Self come ether, air, fire, the waters, and earth upholder of all.\n\nWithout quality or activity, everlasting, free from doubt, stainless,\nchangeless, formless, ever free am I the spotless Self.\n\nLike ether, outside and inside all, I am unmoved; always all-equal, pure,\nunstained, spotless, unchanged.\n\nThe ever-pure lonely one, the partless bliss, the secondless, truth, wisdom,\nendless, the Supreme Eternal; this am I.\n\nThus the steadily-held remembrance that 'I am the Eternal' takes away all\nunwisdom, as the healing essence stills all pain.\n\nIn solitude, passionless, with powers well-ruled, let\n\np. 111\n\nhim be intent on the one, the Self, with no thought but that endless one.\n\nThe wise through meditation immersing all outward things in the Self, should\nbe intent on that only Self, spotless as shining ether.\n\nSetting aside name, color, form, the insubstantial causes of separateness, the\nknower of the supreme rests in perfect Consciousness and Bliss.\n\nThe difference between knower, knowing, and known exists not in the Self; for\nthrough its own Consciousness and Bliss it shines self-luminous.\n\nThus setting the fire-stick of thought in the socket of the Self, let the\nkindled flame of knowledge burn away the fuel of unwisdom.\n\nBy knowledge, as by dawn, the former darkness is driven away; then is manifest\nthe Self, self-shining like the radiant sun.\n\nYet the Self, though eternally possessed, is as though not possessed, through\nunwisdom. When unwisdom disappears, the Self shines forth like a jewel on\none's own throat.\n\nSeparate life is conceived in the Eternal by error, as a man is imagined in a\npost. But the pain of separation ceases when the truth about it is perceived.\n\nBy entering into real nature, wisdom swiftly arises. Then the unwisdom of 'I'\nand 'mine' disappears, as when a mistake about the position of north and South\nis set right.\n\nThe seeker after union, possessed of all knowledge, sees with the eye of\nwisdom that all things rest in the Self; and this Self is the One, the All.\n\np. 112\n\nSelf is all this moving world; other than Self is naught. As all jars are\nearth, so he beholds all as the Self.\n\nPerfect Freedom even in life is this, that a man should shake himself free\nfrom all the limits of his disguises, through the essence of Reality,\nConsciousness, Bliss, just as the grub becomes the bee.\n\nCrossing the ocean of glamor, and slaying the monsters, passion and hate, the\nseeker for union, perfect in peace, grows luminous in the garden of the Self.\n\nFree from bondage to outward, unlasting pleasures, and returning to the joy of\nthe Self, he shines pure within like the flame in a lamp.\n\nEven when hidden under disguises, let the Sage stand free from them, like pure\nether. Though knowing all, let him be as though he knew nothing; moving\nuntrammelled like the air.\n\nLet the Sage, shaking off his disguises, merge himself utterly in the all-\npervading One; as water in water, ether in ether, flame in flame.\n\nThe gain above all gains, the joy above all joys, the wisdom above all\nwisdoms; let him affirm that it is the Eternal.\n\nWhen this is seen, there is no more to see; when this is attained, there is no\nmore to attain; when this is known, there is no more to know;--let him affirm\nthat this is the Eternal.\n\nUpward, downward, on all sides perfect; Being, Consciousness, Bliss; the\nsecondless, endless, everlasting One;--let him affirm that this is the\nEternal.\n\nThrough the knowledge that nothing is but the Eternal,\n\np. 113\n\nthe unchanging One is beheld by the wise; the aboriginal, partless joy; let\nhim affirm that this is the Eternal.\n\nAs partakers in the bliss of that partless, blissful One, the Evolver and all\nthe powers enjoy their bliss as dependents.\n\nEvery being is bound to the Eternal; every movement follows the Eternal; the\nall-embracing Eternal is in all, as curd is in all milk.\n\nNor small nor great nor short nor long, nor born nor departing, without form,\nattribute, color, name;--let him affirm that this is the Eternal.\n\nThrough whose shining shine the sun and all lights; but who shines not by\nany's light; through whom all this shines;--let him affirm that this is the\nEternal.\n\nAll present within and without, making luminous all this moving, the Eternal\nshines forth glowing of red-hot iron.\n\nThe Eternal is different from the moving world yet other than the Eternal is\nnaught! What is other than the Eternal shines insubstantial, like the mirage\nin the desert.\n\nThings seen and heard are not other than the Eternal. Knowledge of reality\nteaches that all this is the Eternal, the Being, Consciousness, Bliss, the\nsecondless.\n\nThe eye of wisdom beholds the ever-present Consciousness, Bliss, the Self, the\neye of unwisdom beholds not, as the blind beholds not the shining sun.\n\nThe personal life, refined through and through by the fire of wisdom, which\nright learning and knowledge kindle, shines pure as gold, freed from every\nstain.\n\np. 114\n\nThe Self, rising in the firmament of the heart--sun of wisdom, darkness-\ndispersing, all-present, all-supporting--shines forth and illumines all.\n\nHe who, drawing away from space and time, faithfully worships in the holy\nplace of the divine Self--the ever-present, the destroyer of heat and cold and\nevery limit, the stainless, eternally happy--he all-knowing, entering the All,\nbecomes immortal.\n\n( _Thus the Awakening to the Self is completed_.)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Awakening to Reality](cjw17.htm)\n\n"
