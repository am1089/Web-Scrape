It is, moreover, recorded in the (ordinary) world.\n\nThere are, moreover, traditions, apart from the Veda, that certain persons\nlike Dro _n_ a, Dh _ri_ sh _t_ adyumna, Sita, Draupadi, &c., were not born in\nthe ordinary way from\n\np. 126\n\nmothers. In the case of Dro _n_ a and others there was absent the oblation\nwhich is made into the woman; while in the case of Dh _ri_ sh _t_ adyumna and\nothers, even two of the oblations, viz. the one offered into woman and the one\noffered into man, were absent. Hence in other cases also birth may be supposed\nto take place independently of the number of oblations.--It is, moreover,\ncommonly known that the female crane conceives without a male.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 20](sbe38096.htm)\n\n'
