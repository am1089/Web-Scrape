(Nor can there be a causal relation between Nescience, &c.), because on\nthe origination of the subsequent (moment) the preceding one ceases to be.\n\nWe have hitherto argued that Nescience, and so on, stand in a causal relation\nto each other merely, so that they cannot be made to account for the existence\nof aggregates; we are now going to prove that they cannot even be considered\nas efficient causes of the subsequent members of the series to which they\nbelong.\n\nThose who maintain that everything has a momentary existence only admit that\nwhen the thing existing in the second moment  1 enters into being the thing\nexisting in the first moment ceases to be. On this admission it is impossible\nto establish between the two things the relation of cause and effect, since\nthe former momentary existence which ceases or has ceased to be, and so has\nentered into the state of non-existence, cannot be the cause of the later\nmomentary existence.--Let it then be said that the former momentary existence\nwhen it has reached its full development becomes the cause of the later\nmomentary existence.--That also is impossible; for the assumption that a fully\ndeveloped existence exerts a further energy, involves the conclusion that it\nis connected with a second moment (which contradicts the doctrine of universal\nmomentariness).--Then let the mere existence of the antecedent entity\nconstitute its\n\np. 408\n\ncausal energy,--That assumption also is fruitless, because we cannot conceive\nthe origination of an effect which is not imbued with the nature of the cause\n(i.e. in which the nature of the cause does not continue to exist). And to\nassume that the nature of the cause does continue to exist in the effect is\nimpossible (on the Bauddha doctrine), as that would involve the permanency of\nthe cause, and thus necessitate the abandonment of the doctrine of general\nnon-permanency.--Nor can it be admitted that the relation of cause and effect\nholds good without the cause somehow giving its colouring to the effect; for\nthat doctrine might unduly be extended to all cases 1.--Moreover, the\norigination and cessation of things of which the Bauddha speaks must either\nconstitute a thing's own form or another state of it, or an altogether\ndifferent thing. But none of these alternatives agrees with the general\nBauddha principles. If, in the first place, origination and cessation\nconstituted the form of a thing, it would follow that the word 'thing' and the\nwords 'origination' and 'cessation' are interchangeable (which is not the\ncase).--Let then, secondly, the Bauddha says, a certain difference be assumed,\nin consequence of which the terms 'origination' and 'cessation' may denote the\ninitial and final states of that which in the intermediate state is called\nthing.--In that case, we reply, the thing will be connected with three\nmoments, viz. the initial, the intermediate, and the final one, so that the\ndoctrine of general momentariness will have to be abandoned.--Let then, as the\nthird alternative, origination and cessation be altogether different from the\nthing, as much as a buffalo is from a horse.--That too cannot be, we reply;\nfor it would lead to the conclusion that the thing, because altogether\ndisconnected with origination and cessation, is everlasting. And the same\nconclusion would be led up to, if we understood by the origination and\ncessation of a thing merely its perception and non-perception; for the latter\nare attributes of the percipient mind only, not of the thing itself.--Hence\n\np. 409\n\nwe have again to declare the Bauddha doctrine to be untenable.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[407:1](sbe34196.htm#fr_397) Bauddhana _m_ ksha _n_ apadena gha _t_ adir eva\npadartho vyavahriyate na tu tadatinkta _h_ ka _sk_ it ksha _n_ o nama\nhalo#sti.
