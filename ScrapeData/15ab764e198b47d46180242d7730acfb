The Vamana Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n14\\. Vamana Puran\xcc\x81a. "That in which the four-faced Brahma taught the three\nobjects of existence, as subservient to the account of the greatness of\nTrivikrama, which treats also of the \xc5\x9aiva Kalpa, and which consists of ten\nthousand stanzas, is called the Vamana Puran\xcc\x81a 74."\n\nThe Vamana Puran\xcc\x81a contains an account of the dwarf incarnation of Vishn\xcc\x81u;\nbut it is related by Pulastya to Narada, and extends to but about seven\nthousand stanzas. Its contents can scarcely establish its claim to the\ncharacter of a Puran\xcc\x81a 75.\n\np. xlviii\n\nThere is little or no order in the subjects which this work recapitulates, and\nwhich arise out of replies made by Pulastya to questions put abruptly and\nunconnectedly by Narada. The greater part of them relate to the worship of the\nLinga; a rather strange topic for a Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Puran\xcc\x81a, but engrossing the\nprincipal part of the compilation. They are however subservient to the object\nof illustrating the sanctity of certain holy places; so that the Vamana\nPuran\xcc\x81a is little else than a succession of Mahatmyas. Thus in the opening\nalmost of the work occurs the story of Daksha\'s sacrifice, the object of which\nis to send \xc5\x9aiva to Papamochana tirtha at Benares, where he is released from\nthe sin of Brahmanicide. Next conies the story of the burning of Kamadeva, for\nthe purpose of illustrating the holiness of a \xc5\x9aiva-linga at Kedare\xc5\x9bwara in the\nHimalaya, and of Badarika\xc5\x9brama. The larger part of the work consists of the\nSaro-mahatmya, or legendary exemplifications of the holiness of Sthan\xcc\x81u\ntirtha; that is, of the sanctity of various Lingas and certain pools at\nThanesar and Kurukhet, the country north-west from Delhi. There are some\nstories also relating to the holiness of the Godavari river; but the general\nsite of the legends is in Hindustan. In the course of these accounts we have a\nlong narrative of the marriage of \xc5\x9aiva with Uma, and the birth of Kartikeya.\nThere are a few brief allusions to creation and the Manwantaras, but they are\nmerely incidental; and all the five characteristics of a Puran\xcc\x81a are\ndeficient. In noticing the Swarochisha Manwantara, towards the end of the\nbook, the elevation of Bali as monarch of the Daityas, and his subjugation of\nthe universe, the gods included, are described; and this leads to the\nnarration that gives its title to the Puran\xcc\x81a, the birth of Krishn\xcc\x81a as a\ndwarf, for the purpose of humiliating Bali by fraud, as he was invincible by\nforce. The story is told as usual, but the scene is laid at Kurukshetra.\n\nA more minute examination of this work than that which has been given to it\nmight perhaps discover some hint from which to conjecture its date. It is of a\nmore tolerant character than the Puran\xcc\x81as, and divides its homage between \xc5\x9aiva\nand Vishn\xcc\x81u with tolerable impartiality. It is not connected, therefore, with\nany sectarial principles, and may have preceded their introduction. It has\nnot, however, the air of any antiquity,\n\np. xlix\n\nand its compilation may have amused the leisure of some Brahman of Benares\nthree or four centuries ago.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xlvii:74](vp018.htm#fr_73) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_04700.jpg)\n\n[xlvii:75](vp018.htm#fr_74) From the extracts from the Vamana Pura translated\nby Col. Vans Kennedy, p. 293 et seq., it appears that his copy so far\ncorresponds with mine, and the work is therefore probably the same: two copies\nin the Company\'s library also agree with mine.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15.
