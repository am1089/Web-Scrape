From a ritualistic point of view, there is a radical\ndifference between these two ceremonies. The Ra _g_ asuya, or 'inauguration of\na king,' strictly speaking, is not a Soma-sacrifice, but rather a complex\nreligious ceremony which includes, amongst other rites, the performance of a\nnumber of Soma-sacrifices of different kinds. The Va _g_ apeya, or 'drink of\nstrength' (or, perhaps, 'the race-cup'), on the other hand, is recognised as\none of the different forms (sa _m_ stha) which a single Soma-sacrifice may\ntake. As a matter of fact, however, this form hardly ever occurs, as most of\nthe others constantly do, in connection with, and as a constituent element of,\nother ceremonies, but is almost exclusively performed as an independent\nsacrifice. The reason why this sacrifice has received a special treatment in\nthe Brahma _n_ a, between the Agnish _t_ oma and the Ra _g_ asuya, doubtless\nis that, unlike the other forms of Soma-sacrifice, it has some striking\nfeatures of its own which stamp it, like the Ra _g_ asuya, as a political\nceremony. According to certain ritualistic authorities 1, indeed, the\nperformance of the Va _g_ apeya should be arranged in much the same way as\nthat of the Ra _g_ asuya; that is, just as the central ceremony of the Ra _g_\nasuya, viz. the Abhishe _k_ aniya or consecration, is preceded and followed by\ncertain other Soma-days, so the Va _g_ apeya should be preceded and followed\nby exactly corresponding ceremonies.\n\np. xii\n\nThe preceding Ka _n_ _d_ a was chiefly taken up with a detailed discussion of\nthe simplest form of a complete Soma-sacrifice, the Agnish _t_ oma, serving as\nthe model for all other kinds of one-day (ekaha) Soma-sacrifices; and it also\nadverted incidentally to some of the special features of such of the remaining\nfundamental forms of Soma-sacrifice as are required for the performance of\nsacrificial periods of from two to twelve pressing-days--the so-called ahina-\nsacrifices--as well as for the performance of the sacrificial sessions\n(sattra) lasting from twelve days upwards. As the discussion of the Va _g_\napeya presupposes a knowledge of several of those fundamental forms of Soma-\nsacrifice, it may not be out of place here briefly to recapitulate their\ncharacteristic features.\n\nThe ekaha, or 'one-day' sacrifices, arc those Soma-sacrifices which have a\nsingle pressing-day, consisting of three services (or pressings, savana)--the\nmorning, midday, and third (or evening) services--at each of which certain\ncups of Soma-liquor are drawn, destined to be ultimately consumed by the\npriests and sacrificer, after libations to the respective deities have been\nduly made therefrom. At certain stated times during the performance, hymns\n(stotra) are chanted by the Udgat _ri_ s; each of which is followed by an\nappropriate recitation ( _s_ astra) of Vedic hymns or detached verses, by the\nHot _ri_ priest or one of his assistants. An integral part of each Soma-\nsacrifice, moreover, is the animal sacrifice (pa _s_ ubandhu); the number of\nvictims varying according to the particular form of sacrifice adopted. In the\nexposition of the Agnish _t_ oma, the animal offering actually described (part\nii, p. 162, seq.) is that of a he-goat to Agni and Soma, intended to serve as\nthe model for all other animal sacrifices. This description is inserted in the\nBrahma _n_ a among the ceremonies of [the day preceding the Soma-day, the\nanimal offering to Agni-Soma being indeed a constant feature of that day's\nproceedings at every Soma-sacrifice; whilst the slaughter of the special\nvictim, or victims, of the respective sacrifice takes place during the morning\nservice](errata.htm#0), and the meat-oblations are made during the evening\nservice of the pressing-day. The ritualistic works enumerate a considerable\nnumber of 'one-day' sacrifices, all of them with special features of their\n\np. xiii\n\nown; most of these sacrifices are, however, merely modifications of one or\nother of the fundamental forms of ekahas. Of such forms or sa _m_ sthas--\nliterally, 'completions,' being so called because the final chants or\nceremonies are their most characteristic features--the ritual system\nrecognises seven, viz. the Agnish _t_ oma. Atyagnish _t_ oma. Ukthya, Sho _d_\na _s_ in, Va _g_ apeya 1, Atiratra, and Aptoryama.\n\nThe Agnish _t_ oma, the simplest and most common form of Soma-sacrifice,\nrequires the immolation of a single victim, a he-goat to Agni; and the\nchanting of twelve stotras, viz. the Bahish-pavamana and four \xc3\x82 _g_ ya-stotras\nat the morning service; the Madhyandina-pavamana and four P _ri_ sh _th_\na-stotras at the midday service; and the T _ri_ tiya (or \xc3\x82rbhava)-pavamana and\nthe Agnish _t_ oma-saman at the evening service. It is this last-named chant,\nthen, that gives its name to this sacrifice which, indeed, is often explained\nas the 'Agnish _t_ oma-sa _m_ stha _h_ kratu _h_  2,' or the sacrifice\nconcluding with 'Agni's praise.' The term 'saman,' in its narrow technical\nsense, means a choral melody, a hymn-tune, without reference to the words set\nthereto. Not unfrequently, however, it has to be taken in the wider sense of a\nchanted verse or hymn (triplet), a chorale; but, though the distinction is\nevidently of some importance for the ritual, it is not always easy to\ndetermine the particular sense in which the term is meant to be applied, viz.\nwhether a specified saman is intended to include the original text set to the\nrespective tune, or whether some other verses to which that tune has been\nadapted are intended. In the case of the Agnish _t_ oma-saman, however, the\nword 'saman' cannot be taken in its narrow acceptation, but the term has to be\nunderstood in the sense of 'a hymn chanted in praise of Agni.' The words\ncommonly used for this chant, are the first two verses of Rig-veda S. VI, 48,\na hymn indeed\n\np. xiv\n\nadmirably adapted for the purpose of singing Agni's praises. For the first\nverse, beginning 'ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a vo agnaye,' the chief tune-book,\nthe Gramageya-gana, has preserved four different tunes, all of which are\nascribed to the _Ri_ shi Bharadva _g_ a: one of them has, however, come to be\ngenerally accepted as the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya-tune \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xe1\xbe\xbd \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbe\xce\xbf\xcf\x87\xce\xae\xce\xbd, and has\nbeen made use of for this and numerous other triplets 1; whilst the other\ntunes seem to have met with little favour, not one of them being represented\nin the triplets arranged for chanting in stotras, as given in the \xc3\x9bha and\nUhya-ganas. Neither the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya-tune, nor its original\ntext, is however a fixed item in the chanting of the Agnish _t_ oma-saman.\nThus, for the first two verses of Rig-veda VI, 48, the Va _g_ apeya-sacrifice\n2 substitutes verses nine and ten of the same hymn, and these are chanted, not\nto the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya, but to the Varavantiya-tune, originally\ncomposed for, and named after, Rig-veda I, 27, 1 (S. V. I, 17; ed. Calc. I, p.\n121) 'a _s_ va _m_ na tva varavantam.'\n\nThe Ukthya-sacrifice requires the slaughtering of a second victim, a he-goat\nto Indra and Agni; and to the twelve chants of the Agnish _t_ oma it adds\nthree more, the so-called Uktha-stotras, each of which is again followed by an\nUktha- _s_ astra recited by one of the Hotrakas, or assistants of the Hot\n_ri_. As the evening service of the Agnish _t_ oma had only two _s_ astras,\nboth recited by the Hot _ri_ , the addition of the three _s_ astras of the\nHotrakas would, in this respect, equalize the evening to the morning and\nmidday savanas. The word 'uktha' is explained by later lexicographers either\nas a synonym of 'saman,' or as a kind of saman 3; but it is not unlikely that\nthat meaning of the word was directly derived from this, the most common, use\nof the word in the term 'uktha-stotra.' The etymology of the word 4, at all\nevents, would point to the\n\np. xv\n\nmeaning 'verse, hymn,' rather than to that of 'tune' or 'chant;' but, be that\nas it may, the word is certainly used in the former sense in the term 'mahad-\nuktha,' the name of the 'great recitation' of a thousand b _ri_ hati verses 1,\nbeing the Hot _ri_ 's _s_ astra in response to the Mahavrata-stotra at the\nlast but one day of the Gavam-ayana. And, besides, at the Agnish _t_ oma a\nspecial 'ukthya' cup of Soma-juice is drawn both at the morning and midday\npressings, but not at the evening savana. This cup, which is eventually shared\nby the three principal Hotrakas between them, is evidently intended as their\nreward for the recitation of their 'ukthas.' At the Ukthya-sacrifice, as might\nhave been expected, the same cup is likewise drawn at the evening service.\nThough it may be taken for granted, therefore, that 'uktha' was an older term\nfor ' _s_ astra,' it still seems somewhat strange that this terns should have\nbeen applied specially to the additional _s_ astras and stotras of the Ukthya-\nsacrifice. Could it be that the name of the additional Ukthya-cup, as a\ndistinctive feature of this sacrifice, suggested the name for the _s_ astras\nand stotras with which that cup was connected, or have we rather to look for\nsome such reason as Ait. Br. VI, 13 might seem to indicate? This passage\ncontains a discussion regarding the different status of the Hotrakas who have\nukthas of their own, and those who have not; and it then proceeds to consider\nthe difference that exists between the two first and the third savanas of the\nAgnish _t_ oma in respect of the Hotrakas' ukthas. It is clear that here also,\nthe term 'uktha' can hardly be taken otherwise than as referring to\n\np. xvi\n\nthe _s_ astras--though, no doubt, the stotra is sometimes said to belong to\nthe priest who recites the _s_ astra in response to it--and this paragraph of\nthe Brahma _n_ a reads almost like the echo of an old discussion as to whether\nor not there should be recitations for the Hotrakas at the evening service of\na complete Soma-sacrifice. If, in this way, the question of uktha or no uktha\nhad become a sort of catchword for ritualistic controversy, one could\nunderstand how the term came ultimately to be applied to the three additional\nstotras and _s_ astras.\n\nNot unfrequently, the Ukthya is treated merely as a redundant Agnish _t_ oma,\nas an 'Agnish _t_ oma _h_ soktha _h_ ,' or Agnish _t_ oma with the Ukthas 1.\nConsidering, however, that the term Agnish _t_ oma, properly speaking, belongs\nonly to a Soma-sacrifice which ends with the Agnish _t_ oma (saman), and that\nthe addition of the Uktha-stotras also involves considerable modifications in\nthe form of most of the preceding chants, a new term such as Ukthya, based on\nthe completing and characteristic chants of this form of sacrifice, was\ndecidedly more convenient. In regard to the composition of the preceding\nstotras, with the exception of the Madhyandina-pavamana and the Agnish _t_\noma-saman, the Ukthya, indeed, may be said to constitute a parallel form of\nSacrifice beside the Agnish _t_ oma 2, the succeeding sa _m_ sthas following\nthe model of either the one or the other of these two parallel forms.\n\nThe Sho _d_ a _s_ in-sacrifice requires, as a third victim, the\n\np. xvii\n\nimmolation of a ram to Indra; and one additional chant, the sho _d_ a _s_\ni-stotra, with its attendant _s_ astra and Soma-cup. The most natural\nexplanation of the name is the one supplied, in the first place, by Ait. Br.\nIV, 1 (as interpreted by Saya _n_ a)--viz. the sacrifice which has sixteen, or\na sixteenth, stotra 1. But, as the name applies not only to the sacrifice but\nalso to the stotra and _s_ astra, the Brahma _n_ a further justifies the name\nby the peculiar composition of the sho _d_ a _s_ i- _s_ astra in which the\nnumber sixteen prevails 2. Very probably, however, the name may have belonged\nto the sacrifice long before the _s_ astra, for symbolic reasons, had assumed\nthe peculiar form it now presents.\n\nIn this summary of the characteristic features of the forms of Soma-sacrifice\npresupposed by the Va _g_ apeya, no mention has yet been made of the Atyagnish\n_t_ oma, or redundant Agnish _t_ oma, which usually occupies the second place\nin the list of sa _m_ sthas. This form of sacrifice is indeed very little\nused, and there can be little doubt that it was introduced into the system, as\nProfessor Weber suggests, merely for the sake of bringing up the Soma-sa _m_\nsthas to the sacred number of seven. This sacrifice is obtained by the\naddition of the sho _d_ a _s_ i-stotra to the twelve chants of the Agnish _t_\noma, as well as of the special Soma-cup and sacrificial victim for Indra,\nconnected with that chant. It may thus be considered as a short form of the\nSho _d_ a _s_ in-sacrifice (though without the full complement of stotras\nimplied in that name), which might have suited the views of such ritualists as\nheld the _s_ astras of the Hotrakas at the evening service to be superfluous\n3.\n\nThe distinctive feature of the Atiratra-sacrifice, as the name itself\nindicates, is an 'overnight' performance of chants and recitations, consisting\nof three rounds of four stotras and _s_ astras each. At the end of each round\n\np. xviii\n\n[paragraph continues] (paryaya) libations are offered, followed by the\ninevitable potations of Soma-liquor. That the performance, indeed, partook\nlargely of the character of a regular nocturnal carousal, may be gathered from\nthe fact, specially mentioned in the Aitareya Brahma _n_ a, that each of the\nHot _ri_ 's offering-formulas is to contain the three words--'andhas,' Soma-\nplant (or liquor), 'pa,' to drink, and 'mada,' intoxication. Accordingly, one\nof the formulas used is Rig-veda II, 19, 1 apayy asya\xe0\xa4\xbdndhaso madaya, 'there\nhas been drunk (by Indra, or by us) of this juice for intoxication.' The\ntwelve stotras, each of which is chanted to a different tune, are followed up,\nat daybreak, by the Sandhi-stotra, or twilight-chant, consisting of six verses\n(Sama-veda S. II, 99-104) chanted to the Rathantara-tune. This chant is\nsucceeded by the Hot _ri_ 's recitation of the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina- _s_ astra, a\nmodification of the ordinary 'pratar-anuvaka,' or morning-litany, by which the\npressing-day of a Soma-sacrifice is ushered in 1. The Atiratra also requires a\nspecial victim, viz. a he-goat offered to Sarasvati, the goddess of speech. As\nregards the ceremonies preceding the night-performance, there is again a\ndifference of opinion among ritualists as to whether the sho _d_ a _s_\ni-stotra, with its attendant rites, is, or is not, a necessary element of the\nAtiratra 2. Some authorities 3, accordingly, distinctly recognise two\ndifferent kinds of Atiratra,--one with, and the other without, the sho _d_ a\n_s_ in. In Katyayana's Sutra, there is no allusion to any difference of\nopinion on this point, but, in specifying the victims required at the\ndifferent Soma-sacrifices, he merely remarks (IX, 8, 5) that, 'At the Atiratra\nthere is a fourth victim to Sarasvati.' This would certainly seem to imply\nthat there are also to be the three preceding victims, including the one to\nIndra peculiar to the Sho _d_ a _s_ in. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana (V, 11, 1) also refers\nincidentally to the sho _d_ a _s_ in as part of the\n\np. xix\n\n[paragraph continues] Atiratra, though it is not quite clear from the text of\nthe sutra whether it is meant to be a necessary or only an optional feature of\nthat sacrifice. The Aitareya [Brahma _n_ a](errata.htm#1) (IV, 6), on the\nother hand, in treating of the Atiratra, enters on a discussion with the view\nof showing that the night-performance of that sacrifice is in every respect\nequal to the preceding day-performance; and accordingly, as the three services\nof the day-performance include fifteen chants and recitations (viz. the twelve\nof the Agnish _t_ oma, and the three Ukthas), so, during the night, the three\nrounds of in all twelve stotras, together with the sandhi-stotra, here counted\nas three stotras (triplets), make up the requisite fifteen chants. This Brahma\n_n_ a, then, does not recognise the sho _d_ a _s_ in as part of the Atiratra,\nand, indeed, the manuals of the Atiratra chants which I have consulted make no\nmention of the sho _d_ a _s_ i-stotra, though it is distinctly mentioned there\namong the chants of the Va _g_ apeya and the Aptoryama. The passage in the\nAitareya, just referred to, also seems to raise the question as to whether the\nAtiratra is really an ekaha, or whether it is not rather an ahina-sacrifice.\nOn this point also the authorities seem to differ; whilst most writers take\nthe Atiratra. and the analogous Aptoryama, to be 'one-day' sacrifices, the Ta\n_n_ _d_ ya Brahma _n_ a (XX) and La _t_ y. IX, 5, 6 class them along with the\nAhinas 1; and they may indeed be regarded as intermediate links between the\ntwo classes of Soma-sacrifice, inasmuch as, in a continued sacrificial\nperformance, the final recitations of these sacrifices take the place of the\nopening ceremony of the next day's performance. Such, for instance, is the\ncase in the performance of the Atiratra as the opening day of the Dvada _s_\naha, or twelve days' period of sacrifice; whilst in the performance of the\ntwelfth and concluding day, which is likewise an Atiratra, the concluding\nceremonies of the latter might be considered in\n\np. xx\n\na manner superabundant. It is probably in this sense that La _t_ y. (IX, 5, 4)\ncalls the overnight performance of the last day of an ahina (e. g. the Dvada\n_s_ aha) the ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ apu _k_ _kh_ a, or tail of the sacrifice, which is to\nfall beyond the month for which, from the time of the initiation, the ahina is\nto last.\n\nThe Aptoryama-sacrifice represents an amplified form of the Atiratra. It\nrequires the sho _d_ a _s_ i-stotra and the ceremonies connected with it as a\nnecessary element of its performance; whilst its distinctive feature consists\nin four additional (atirikta-) stotras and _s_ astras, chanted and recited\nafter the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina- _s_ astra, the concluding recitation of the Atiratra.\nThese four chants are arranged in such a manner that each successive stotra is\nchanted to a different tune, and in a more advanced form of composition, from\nthe triv _ri_ t (nine-versed) up to the ekavi _m_ _s_ a (twenty-one-versed)\nstoma. In the liturgical manuals, the Aptoryama, moreover, performs the\nfunction of serving as the model for a sacrificial performance with all the 'p\n_ri_ sh _th_ as 1.' Though this mode of chanting has been repeatedly referred\nto in the translation and notes, a few additional remarks on this subject may\nnot be out of place here. When performed in its 'p _ri_ sh _th_ a' form, the\nstotra is so arranged that a certain saman (or chanted triplet) is enclosed,\nas the 'garbha' (embryo), within some other saman which, as its 'p _ri_ sh\n_th_ a' (i.e. back, or flanks), is chanted a number of times before and after\nthe verses of the central saman. The tunes most commonly used for forming the\nenclosing samans of a P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra are the Rathantara and B _ri_\nhat; and along with these, four others are singled out to make up the six P\n_ri_ sh _th_ a-samans \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xe1\xbe\xbd \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbe\xce\xbf\xcf\x87\xce\xae\xce\xbd, viz. the Vairupa (with the text Sama-veda\nII, 212-13), Vaira _g_ a (II, 277-9), _S_ akvara 2 (chanted on the Mahanamni\nverses,\n\np. xxi\n\n[paragraph continues] Aitar. \xc3\x82r. IV), and Raivata 1 samans., These six samans\nare employed during the six days' sacrificial period called P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-\nsha _d_ aha, in such a way that one of them, in the order in which they are\nhere enumerated, is used for the first, or Hot _ri_ 's, P _ri_ sh _th_\na-stotra on the successive days of that period. In that case, however, these\nstotras are not performed in the proper 'p _ri_ sh _th_ a' form 2, i.e. they\nhave no other saman inserted within them, but they are treated like any other\ntriplet according to the particular stoma, or mode of composition, prescribed\nfor them. But, on the other hand, in the Aptoryama, when performed 'with all\nthe P _ri_ sh _th_ as,' not only are a number of stotras chanted in the proper\n'p _ri_ sh _th_ a' form, but the 'p _ri_ sh _th_ a' element asserts itself in\nyet another way, viz. by the appearance of all the six 'P _ri_ sh _th_\na-samans' in the course of the performance of the different stotras, in this\nway:--the Rathantara-tune forms the middlemost of the seven triplets of which\nthe Madhyandina-pavamana is composed;\n\np. xxii\n\nthe B _ri_ hat forms the 'garbha,' or enclosed saman, of the Agnish _t_ oma-\nsaman 1; the Vairupa the garbha of the third, the Vaira _g_ a that of the\nfirst, the _S_ akvara that of the second, and the Raivata that of the fourth,\nP _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra. It is doubtless this feature which gives to certain\nSoma-days the name of 'sarvap _ri_ sh _th_ a,' or one performed with all the\n(six) P _ri_ sh _th_ as. Then, as regards the particular stotras that are\nchanted in the proper 'p _ri_ sh _th_ a' form, these include not only the four\nso-called P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras of the midday service, but also the four\n\xc3\x82gya-stotras of the morning service, as well as the Agnish _t_ oma-saman and\nthe three Uktha-stotras of the evening service,--in short, all the first\nfifteen stotras with the exception of the three Pavamana-stotras. Of the\nstotras which succeed the Ukthas, on the other hand--viz. the Sho _d_ a _s_\nin, the twelve chants of the three night-rounds, the Sandhi-stotra, and the\nfour Atirikta-stotras--not one is performed in the 'p _ri_ sh _th_ a' form.\nHow often the several verses of the 'p _ri_ sh _th_ a-saman,' and those of the\n'garbha' are to be chanted, of course depends, in each case, not only on the\nparticular stoma which has to be performed, but also on the particular mode\n(vish _t_ uti) prescribed, or selected, for the stoma. Thus, while all the\nfour \xc3\x82gya-stotras are chanted in the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a, or fifteen-versed-\nstoma; the four P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras are to be performed in the ekavi _m_\n_s_ a (of twenty-one verses), the _k_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a (of twenty-four\nverses), the _k_ atu _s_ _k_ atvari _m_ _s_ a (of forty-four verses), and the\nash _t_ a _k_ atvari _m_ _s_ a (of forty-eight verses) respectively. Now\nwhenever, as in the case of the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a and the ekavi _m_ _s_\na-stomas, the number of verses is divisible by three, one third of the total\nnumber of verses is usually assigned to each of the three parts of the stotra,\nand distributed over the respective (three or sometimes four) verses of that\nsaman 2\n\np. xxiii\n\n[paragraph continues] To illustrate this tripartite composition, the Hot _ri_\n's P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra, performed in the twenty-one-versed stoma. may be\ntaken as an example. For the 'p _ri_ sh _th_ a,' the manuals give the B _ri_\nhat-saman, on its original text (Sama-veda II, 159,160, 'tvam id dhi\nhavamahe,' arranged so as to form three verses), though the Rathantara may be\nused instead 1. For the 'garbha,' or enclosed saman, on the other hand, the\nVaira _g_ a-saman (with its original text, S. V. II, 277-9, 'piba somam indra\nmandatu tva') is to be used, a most elaborate tune 2, with long sets of\nstobhas, or musical ejaculations, inserted in the text. Of the twenty-one\nverses, of which the stoma consists, seven verses would thus fall to the share\nof the 'garbha,' and seven verses to that of the p _ri_ sh _th_ a,' as chanted\nbefore and after the 'garbha.' Thus, in accordance with the formula set forth\nin p. xxii, note 2, the three verses (a, b, c) of the B _ri_ hat would be\nchanted in the form aaa-bbb-c; then the verses of the Vaira _g_ a-saman (as\n'garbha') in the form a-bbb-ccc; and finally again the B _ri_ hat in the form\naaa-b-ccc. Stotras, the total number of verses of which is not divisible by\nthree, of course require a slightly different distribution. Thus, of the third\nP _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra, the stoma of which consists of forty-four verses, the\ntwo parts of the 'p _ri_ sh _th_ a' obtain fifteen verses each, whilst the\n'garbha' has only fourteen verses for its share.\n\nThe Va _g_ apeya, the last of the seven forms of a complete Soma-sacrifice,\noccupies an independent position beside the Atiratra and Aptoryama, whose\nspecial features it does not share. Like them, it starts from the Sho _d_ a\n_s_ in, to the characteristic (sixteenth) chant (and recitation) of which it\nacids one more stotra, the Va _g_ apeya-saman, chanted to the B _ri_ hat-tune,\nin the Saptada _s_ a (seventeen-versed) stoma, and followed by the recitation\nof the Va _g_ apeya- _s_ astra. The Saptada _s_ a-stoma, indeed, is so\ncharacteristic of this sacrifice that--as has been set forth at [p.\n8](sbe4104.htm#page_8) note\n\np. xxiv\n\nbelow--all the preceding chants, from the Bahishpavamana onward, are\nremodelled in accordance with it. Besides, over and above the three victims of\nthe Sho _d_ a _s_ in-sacrifice, the Va _g_ apeya requires, not only a fourth\none, sacred to Sarasvati, the goddess of speech, but also a set of seventeen\nvictims for Pra _g_ apati, the god of creatures and procreation. As regards\nother rites peculiar to the Va _g_ apeya, the most interesting, doubtless, is\nthe chariot-race in which the sacrificer, who must be either of the royal or\nof the priestly order, is allowed to carry off the palm, and from which this\nsacrifice perhaps derives its name. Professor Hillebrandt 1, indeed, would\nclaim for this feature of the sacrifice the character of a relic of an old\nnational festival, a kind of Indian Olympic games; and though there is perhaps\nhardly sufficient evidence to bear out this conjecture, it cannot at least be\ndenied that this feature has a certain popular look about it.\n\nSomewhat peculiar are the relations between the Va _g_ apeya and the Ra _g_\nasuya on the one hand, and between the Va _g_ apeya and the B _ri_ haspatisava\non the other. In the first chapter of the fifth book, the author of this part\nof our Brahma _n_ a is at some pains to impress the fact that the Va _g_ apeya\nis a ceremony of superior value and import to the Ra _g_ asuya; and hence\nKatyayana (XV, 1, 1-2) has two rules to the effect that the Ra _g_ asuya may\nbe performed by a king who has not yet performed the Va _g_ apeya. These\nauthorities would thus seem to consider the drinking of the Va _g_ apeya-cup a\nmore than sufficient equivalent for the Ra _g_ asuya, or inauguration of a\nking; they do not, however, say that the Ra _g_ asuya must be performed prior\nto the Va _g_ apeya, but only maintain that the Va _g_ apeya cannot be\nperformed after the Ra _g_ asuya. The Ra _g_ asuya, according to the Brahma\n_n_ a, confers on the sacrificer royal dignity (ra _g_ ya), and the Va _g_\napeya paramount sovereignty (samra _g_ ya). It might almost seem as if the\nrelatively loose positions here assigned to the Ra _g_ asuya were entirely\nowing to the fact that it is a purely Kshatriya ceremony to which the\n\np. xxv\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahma _n_ a has no right, whilst the Va _g_ apeya may\nbe performed by Brahma _n_ as as well as Kshatriyas. But on whatever grounds\nthis appreciation of the two ceremonies may be based, it certainly goes right\nin the face of the rule laid down by \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana (IX, 9, 19) that, 'after\nperforming the Va _g_ apeya, a king may perform the Ra _g_ asuya, and a Brahma\n_n_ a the B _ri_ haspatisava.' With this rule would seem to accord the\nrelative value assigned to the two ceremonies in the Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita\n(V, 6, 2, 1) and Brahma _n_ a (II, 7, 6, 1), according to which the Va _g_\napeya is a 'samra _t_ sava,' or consecration to the dignity of a paramount\nsovereign, while the Ra _g_ asuya is called a 'varu _n_ asava,' i.e.,\naccording to Saya _n_ a, a consecration to the universal sway wielded by Varu\n_n_ a 1. In much the same sense we have doubtless to understand the rule in\nwhich La _t_ yayana defines the object of the Va _g_ apeya (VIII, 11, 1), viz.\n'Whomsoever the Brahma _n_ as and kings (or nobles) may place at their head,\nlet him perform the Va _g_ apeya.' All these authorities, with the exception\nof the _S_ atapatha-Brahma _n_ a and Katyayana, are thus agreed in making the\nVa _g_ apeya a preliminary ceremony, performed by a Brahma _n_ a who is raised\nto the dignity of a Purohita, or head-priest (so to speak, a minister of\nworship, and court-priest), or by a king who is elected paramount sovereign by\na number of petty ra _g_ as; this sacrifice being in due time followed by the\nrespective installation and consecration ceremony, viz. the B _ri_\nhaspatisava, in the case of the Purohita; and the Ra _g_ asuya, in that of the\nking. In regard to the B _ri_ haspatisava, which these authorities place on an\nequality with the Ra _g_ asuya, our Brahma _n_ a finds itself in a somewhat\nawkward position, and it gets out of its difficulty (V, 2, 1, 19) by simply\nidentifying the B _ri_ haspatisava with the Va _g_ apeya, and making the Va\n_g_ apeya itself to be 'the consecration of B _ri_ haspati;' and Katyayana\n(XIV, 1, 2) compromises matters by combining the two ceremonies in this way\nthat he who performs the Va _g_ apeya is to perform the B _ri_ haspatisava for\na fortnight before and after the Va _g_ apeya.\n\np. xxvi\n\nThe Ra _g_ asuya, or inauguration of a king, is a complex ceremony which,\naccording to the _S_ rauta-sutras, consists of a long succession of\nsacrificial performances, spread over a period of upwards of two years. It\nincludes seven distinct Soma-sacrifices, viz. 1, the Pavitra, an Agnish _t_\noma serving as the opening sacrifice, and followed, after an interval of a\nyear (during which the seasonal sacrifices have to be performed), by 2, the\nAbhishe _k_ aniya, an Ukthya-sacrifice, being the consecration (or anointing)\nceremony. Then follows 3, the Da _s_ apeya, or 'drink of ten,' an Agnish _t_\noma, so-called because ten priests take part in drinking the Soma-liquor\ncontained in each of the ten cups. After another year's interval 1, during\nwhich monthly 'offerings to the beams (i.e. the months)' are made, takes place\n4, the Ke _s_ avapaniya, or hair-cutting ceremony, an Atiratra-sacrifice;\nfollowed, after a month or fortnight, by d, and 6, the Vyush _t_ i-dviratra,\nor two nights' ceremony of the dawning, consisting of an Agnish _t_ oma and an\nAtiratra and finally 7, the Kshatra-dh _ri_ ti, or 'the wielding of the\n(royal) power,' an Agnish _t_ oma performed a month later. The round of\nceremonies concludes with the Sautrama _n_ i, an ish _t_ i the object of which\nis to make amends for any excess committed in the consumption of Soma-liquor.\n\nThe fifth book completes the dogmatic discussion of the ordinary circle of\nsacrifices, some less common, or altogether obsolete, ceremonies, such as the\nA _s_ vamedha (horse-sacrifice), Purushamedha (human sacrifice), Sarvamedha\n(sacrifice for universal rule), being dealt with, by way of supplement, in the\nthirteenth book.\n\nWith the sixth Ka _n_ _d_ a, we enter on the detailed explanation of the Agni\n_k_ ayana, or building of the fire-altar, a very solemn ceremony which would\nseem originally to have stood apart from, if not in actual opposition to, the\nordinary sacrificial system, but which, in the end. apparently by some\necclesiastical compromise, was added\n\np. xxvii\n\non to the Soma ritual as an important, though not indispensable, element of\nit. The avowed object of this ceremony is the super-exaltation of Agni, the\nFire, who, in the elaborate cosmogenic legend with which this section begins,\nis identified with Pra _g_ apati, the lord of Generation, and the source of\nlife in the world. As the present volume contains, however, only a portion of\nthe Agni _k_ ayana ritual, any further remarks on this subject may be reserved\nfor a future occasion.\n\nSince the time when this volume went to press, the literature of the Soma myth\nhas been enriched by the appearance of an important book, the first volume of\nProfessor A. Hillebrandt's Vedische Mythologie, dealing with Soma and cognate\ngods. As it is impossible for me here to enter into a detailed discussion of\nthe numerous points raised in the work, I must content myself for the present\nwith the remark that I believe Professor Hillebrandt to have fully established\nthe main point of his position, viz. the identity of Soma with the Moon in\nearly Vedic mythology.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xi:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_0) See Katy. Sr. XIV, 1, 7; La _t_ y. Sr. VIII, 11,\n7-11.\n\n[xiii:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_1) In this enumeration the Va _g_ apeya is often\nplaced between the Atiratra and Aptoryama; La _t_ y. V, 4, 24.\n\n[xiii:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_2) Thus on Sat. Br. V, 1, 3, 1 \xc3\x82gneyam agnish _t_ oma\nalabhate, Saya _n_ a remarks, 'agni _h_ stuyate\xe0\xa4\xbdsminn ity agnish _t_ omo nama\nsama, tasmin vishayabhuta agneyam alabhate, etena pasuna\xe0\xa4\xbdsmin vagapeye\xe0\xa4\xbdgnish\n_t_ omasa _m_ stha _m_ kratum evanush _th_ itavan bhavati.' In IV, 2, 4, 9\nseq., also, the term 'agnish _t_ oma' would seem to apply to the final chant\nrather than to the whole sacrifice.\n\n[xiv:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_3) Each Saman-tune is usually chanted thrice, either\neach time on a special verse of its own, or so that, by certain repetitions of\nwords, two verses are made to suffice for the thrice-repeated tune.\n\n[xiv:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_4) So also does the Agnish _t_ ut ekaha, cf. Ta _n_ _d_\nya Br. XVII, 7.\n\n[xiv:3](sbe4102.htm#fr_5) Saya _n_ a, to Sat. Br. IV, 3, 3, 2, explains it by\n'stotra;' but see IV, 2, 3, 6-9 where it undoubtedly refers to the recited\nverses ( _ri_ _k_ ), not to the saman.\n\n[xiv:4](sbe4102.htm#fr_6) Viz. from root 'va _k_ ' to speak. I cannot see the\nnecessity for taking p. xv 'b _ri_ had va _k_ as' in Rig-veda VII, 96, 1 in\nthe technical sense of B _ri_ hat-tune, as is done by Prof. Hillebrandt, in\nhis interesting essay, 'Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-Indien,' p. 29, merely\nbecause it is used there in connection with Indra; whilst he himself is\ndoubtful as to whether it should be taken in the same sense in III, 10, 5\nwhere it occurs in connection with Agni. Though the B _ri_ hat-saman is no\ndoubt frequently referred to Indra, and the Rathantara to Agni, the couplets\nordinarily chanted to them (Rig-veda VI, 46, 1-2 and VII, 32, 22, 23) are both\nof them addressed to Indra. Both tunes are, however, applied to verses\naddressed to all manner of deities.\n\n[xv:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_7) See Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. of the India Office,\nNo. 434. In Kaush. Br. XI, 8, 'sadasy ukthani _s_ asyante,' also, the word has\nundoubtedly the sense of _s_ astra, or (recited) hymn. In part i, p. 346, note\n3 of this translation read 'great recitation or _s_ astra,' instead of 'great\nchant.'\n\n[xvi:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_8) See, for instance, Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. XX, 1, 1.\n\n[xvi:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_9) Perhaps the most characteristic point of difference\nbetween these two forms in which the fundamental stotras are chanted is the\nfirst (or Hot _ri_ 's) P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra at the midday service. Whilst\nthe Agnish _t_ oma here requires the Rathantara-tune chanted on the text,\nSama-vela S. II, 30, 31; the Ukthya, on the other hand, requires the text, S.\nV. II, 159, 160, chanted to the B _ri_ hat-tune. Professor Hillebrandt, l.c.,\np. 22, has, indeed, tried to show that these two tunes play an important part\nin early India in connection with the celebration of the solstices. A similar\nalternation of samans to that of the Hot _ri_ 's P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra\nobtains at the third, or Brahma _n_ a _k_ _kh_ a _m_ sin's P _ri_ sh _th_\na-stotra; the Naudhasa-saman (II, 35, 36) being used at the Agnish _t_ oma,\nand the _S_ yaita-saman at the Ukthya-sacrifice. As regards the second (or\nMaitravaru _n_ a's) and fourth (or A _k_ _kh_ avaka's) P _ri_ sh _th_\na-stotras, on the other hand, the same saman--viz. the Vamadevya (II, 32-341\nand Kaleya (II, 37, 3S respectively--is used both at the Agnish _t_ oma and\nUkthya.\n\n[xvii:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_10) This is also the explanation of the term given by\nSaya _n_ a in his commentary on Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. XII, 13, 1.\n\n[xvii:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_11) See this translation, part ii, p. 402, note 1.\n\n[xvii:3](sbe4102.htm#fr_12) See part ii, p. 402, note 2, where it is stated\nthat the tenth and last day of the Da _s_ aratra is an Atyagnish _t_ oma day,\ncalled Avivakya, i.e. one on which there should be no dispute or quarrel.\n\n[xviii:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_13) See part ii, p. 226 seq. On the present occasion\nthe Pratur-anuvaka is, however, to consist of as many verses as, counting\ntheir syllables, would make up a thousand b _ri_ hati-verses (of thirty-six\nsyllables each). The three sections of the ordinary morning-litany from the\nbody of the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina- _s_ astra which concludes, after sunrise, with verses\naddressed to Surya, the sun.\n\n[xviii:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_14) Cf. La _t_ y. Sr. VIII, 1, 16; IX, 5, 23 with\ncommentary.\n\n[xviii:3](sbe4102.htm#fr_15) Notably Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. XX, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[xix:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_16) The Aitareya Brahma _n_ a (VI, 18) in discussing\nthe so-called sampata hymns inserted in continued performances, with the view\nof establishing a symbolic connection between the several days, curiously\nexplains the term 'ahina,' not from 'ahas' day, but as meaning 'not defective,\nwhere nothing is left out' (a-hina).\n\n[xx:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_17) From \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana's rule (IX, 11, 4), 'If they\nchant in forming the garbha (i.e. in the 'p _ri_ sh _th_ a' form), let him\n(the Hot _ri_ or Hotraka) recite in the same way the stotriyas and anurupas,'\nit seems, however, clear that the Aptoryama may also be performed without the\nP _ri_ sh _th_ as.\n\n[xx:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_18) The original text of the Sakvara-saman is stated (by\nSaya _n_ a on Aitar. Br. IV, 13; Mahidhara on Va _g_. S. X, 14, &c.) to be\nSama-veda II, 1152-3, 'pro shv asmai puroratham,' but the Sama-veda Ganas do\nnot seem to give the tune p. xxi with that text, but with the Mahanamni verses\n(ed. Bibl. Ind. II, p. 371). The Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. XIII, 4 (and comm.), gives\nminute directions as to the particular padas of the first three Mahanamni\ntriplets which are singled out as of a _s_ akvara (potent) nature, and are\nsupposed to form the three stotriya verses of the sakvara-saman, consisting of\nseven, six, and five padas respectively. The a _s_ akvara padas are, however,\nlikewise chanted in their respective places, as is also the additional tenth\nverse, the five padas of which are treated as mere supplementary (or 'filling\nin') matter.\n\n[xxi:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_19) That is, the Varavantiya-tune adapted to the\n'Revati' verses. The Varavantiya-tune is named after its original text, Rig-\nveda I, 27, 1, 'a _s_ va _m_ na tva varavantam' (Sama-veda, ed. Bibl. Ind. I,\np. 121). When used as one of the P _ri_ sh _th_ a-samans it is not, however,\nthis, its original text, that is chanted to it, but the verses Rig-veda I, 30,\n13-15, 'revatir na _h_ sadhamada' (Sama-veda II, 434-6, ed. vol. iv, p. 56),\nwhence the tune, as adapted to this, triplet, is usually called Raivata. The\nRaivata-saman, thus, is a signal instance of the use of the term 'saman' in\nthe sense of a chanted verse or triplet.\n\n[xxi:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_20) The statement, in part ii, p. 403 note (and\nrepeated in the present part, [p. 6](sbe4104.htm#page_6), note\n[2](sbe4104.htm#fn_37)), that, while the P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras of the\nAbhiplava-sha _d_ aha are performed in the ordinary (Agnish _t_ oma) way, the\nP _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha requires their performance in the proper P _ri_\nsh _th_ a form, is not correct. In both kinds of sha _d_ aha, the P _ri_ sh\n_th_ a-stotras are performed in the ordinary way (viz. in the Agnish _t_ oma\nor Ukthya way, see [p. 4](sbe4103.htm#page_4) note); but whilst, in the\nAbhiplava, the Rathantara and B _ri_ hat samans are used for the Hot _ri_ 's P\n_ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra on alternate days, the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha\nrequires a different P _ri_ sh _th_ a-saman on each of the six days. The two\nkinds of sha _d_ ahas also differ entirely in regard to the sequence of stomas\nprescribed for the performance of the stotras.\n\n[xxii:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_21) Either the Rathantara or the B _ri_ hat also forms\nthe 'p _ri_ sh _th_ a,' or enclosing saman, of the fist P _ri_ sh _th_\na-stotra.\n\n[xxii:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_22) Whenever the stotra is not performed in the 'p\n_ri_ sh _th_ a' form, but consists of a single saman or triplet, the\nrepetitions required to make up the number of verses implied in the respective\nstoma, are distributed over the three verses of the saman in such a way that\nthe whole saman is chanted thrice, each time with various repetitions of the\nsingle verses. The usual form in which the p. xxiii ekavi _m_ _s_ a is\nperformed may be represented by the formula aaa-bbb-c; a-bbb-ccc; aaa-b-ccc,\nmaking together twenty-one verses.\n\n[xxiii:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_23) \xc3\x82 _s_ val. Sr. IX, 3, 4-5.\n\n[xxiii:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_24) It is given somewhat imperfectly in the ed. Bibl.\nInd.
