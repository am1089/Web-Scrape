Once they brought from the forest\ntwo great bundles of firewood and threw them negligently into their teacher\'s\nhouse, without looking. One of the bundles struck the teacher\'s little son so\nthat he died. Then the teacher asked his two pupils, "Which of you two has\nkilled him?" Both answered, "Not I, not I." Hereupon the teacher, being unable\nto (come to a decision in order to) send away, the sinner and to keep the\ninnocent one, called Death, and asked him, "Which of the two has killed the\nboy?" Then Death, finding himself involved in a difficult law-question, began\nto weep, and p. 99 giving his decision, said, "Oh Dharmaprahrada, not to\nKumalana (the dative has the sense of the genitive), this sin is none of\nKumalana\'s!" Instead of declaring, "Dharmaprahrada, thou hast done this,\' he\nsaid, "The other did not do it." Still from the circumstances of the case it\nappeared that the meaning of the answer was, "The other has done it." "This\nwas the decision which he gave crying."\'--The reading of the text rendered in\nthe translation is, dharmaprahrada na kumalanaya.\n\n[99:26](sbe0235.htm#fr_525) Manu IV, 77.\n\n[99:28](sbe0235.htm#fr_526) Manu IV, 70 and 71.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 1, Kha _n_ _d_ a 1](sbe0236.htm)\n\n'
