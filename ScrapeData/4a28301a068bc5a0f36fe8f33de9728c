( _cont_.)\n\n126\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXVI.\n\nThey are optionally vikaras of the Aindragna.\n\np. 349\n\n126c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nSometimes these two Sutras are combined into one. The commentator, however,\nsees in the va of aindragnavikara va a deeper meaning. Agni-Shomau, he says,\nconsists of four, Indragni of three syllables. Therefore if the name of more\nthan one deity consists of four syllables, it should be treated as a vikara of\nthe Agnishomiya, if of less than four syllables, as a vikara of the Aindragna.\n\n127\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXVII.\n\nAn exception must be made in the case of the gods of the prak _ri_ ti, as, for\ninstance, the Aindra puro _d_ a _s_ a, the Saumya _k_ aru.\n\n127c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe exception applies to cases where the offering in a vik _ri_ ti sacrifice\nis meant for the same principal deities as those of the prak _ri_ ti offering.\nFor instance, in the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa Agni and Soma are the deities of\nthe Agnishomiya, Indra and Agni of the Aindragna. If then in one of the\nsecondary or vik _ri_ ti sacrifices there occurs an Aindra puro _d_ a _s_ a,\nor a Saumya _k_ aru, then the Aindra puro _d_ a _s_ a is treated as a vikara\nof the Aindragna, the Saumya karu as a vikara of the Agnishomiya. The Somendra\n_k_ aru also, as its principal deity is Soma, would follow the Agnishomiya,\nthe Indrasomiya puro _d_ a _s_ a, as its principal deity is Indra, would\nfollow the Aindragna.\n\n128\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXVIII.\n\nIf there is sameness both in the offering and in the deity, then the offering\nprevails.\n\n128c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIf a _k_ aru for Pra _g_ apati occurs in a vik _ri_ ti sacrifice, it would\nfollow that, being offered to Pra _g_ apati, it should be offered with\nmurmuring, but, as it is a vegetable offering, it follows the norm of the puro\n_d_ a _s_ a, though the puro _d_ a _s_ a is intended for Agni.\n\np. 350\n\n129\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXIX.\n\nIf there is contradiction with regard to the substance and the preparation of\nan offering, the substance prevails.\n\n129c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nA puro _d_ a _s_ a may be made of vrihi, rice, or of nivara, wild growing\nrice. The wild rice has to be pounded, but not the good rice. The preparation,\nhowever, has to yield in a vik _ri_ ti, the important point being the\nsubstance.\n\n130\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXX.\n\nIf there is contradiction with regard to the substance, the object prevails.\n\n130c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nAn example makes the meaning of this Sutra quite clear. Generally the yupa or\nsacrificial post for fastening sacrificial animals is made of Khadira wood.\nBut if a post made of wood is not strong enough to hold the animal, then an\niron post is to be used, the object being the fastening of the animal, while\nthe material is of less consequence.\n\n131\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXXI.\n\nIn a Prak _ri_ ti sacrifice there is no \xc3\x9bha, modification of the mantras.\n\n131c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nCertain mantras of the Veda have to be slightly altered, when their\napplication varies. In the normal sacrifices, however, no such alteration\ntakes place.\n\n132\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXXII.\n\nIn a Vik _ri_ ti sacrifice modification takes place, according to the sense,\nbut not in an arthavada.\n\n132c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nSome mantras remain the same in the Vik _ri_ ti as in the Prak _ri_ ti. Others\nhave to be modified so as to be\n\np. 351\n\nadapted to anything new that has to be. If, for instance, there is a Puro _d_\na _s_ a for Agni in the Prak _ri_ ti, and in its place a Puro _d_ a _s_ a for\nSurya in the Vik _ri_ ti, then we must place Surya instead of Agni in the\ndedicatory mantra.\n\n133\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXXIII.\n\nWhen we hear words referring to something else, that is arthavada.\n\n133c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nArthavada is generally explained as anything occurring in the Brahma _n_ as\nwhich is not vidhi or command. Here, however, it refers to Mantras or passages\nrecited at the sacrifice. We saw how such passages, if they referred to some\npart of the sacrifice, had to be modified under certain circumstances\naccording to the sense. Here we are told that passages which do not refer to\nanything special in the sacrifice, are arthavada and remain unmodified. All\nthis is expressed by the words paravakya _s_ rava _n_ at. Vakya stands for\npadani, words, such as are used in the nivapamantra, &c. Some of these words\nare called samavetarthani, because they tell of something connected with the\nperformance of the sacrifice, as, for instance, Agnaye _g_ ush _t_ a _m_\nnirvapami, I offer what is acceptable to Agni; others are asamavetarthani, as,\nfor instance, Devasya tva Savitu _h_ prasave. When such passages which are not\nconnected with some sacrificial act occur ( _s_ rava _n_ at), they naturally\nremain unaltered.\n\n134\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXXIV.\n\nIf what is prescribed is absent, a substitute is to be taken according to\nsimilarity.\n\n134c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nHere we have no longer modification, but substitution (pratinidhi). In cases\nwhere anything special that has been prescribed is wanting, a substitute must\nbe chosen, as similar as possible, and producing a similar effect.\n\np. 352\n\n[paragraph continues] According to Ma _n_ _d_ ana's Trika _n_ _d_ a, the\ndegrees of similarity are to be determined in the following order:\n\nKaryai rupais tatha par _n_ ai _h_ kshirai _h_ pushpai _h_ phalair api,  \nGandhai rasai _h_ sad _ri_ g grahyam purvalabhe param param.\n\n'What is similar by effect, by shape, by leaves, by milk, by flowers, and by\nfruit, By smell, or by taste is to be taken one after the other, if the former\ncannot be found.'\n\n135\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXXV.\n\nIf there is nothing very like, something a little like may be substituted,\nonly it must not be prohibited.\n\n135c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIf in a _k_ aru of mudgas, kidney-beans, phaseolus mungo, these kidney-beans\nshould fail, a substitute may be taken, but that substitute must not be\nmashas, phaseolus radiatus, because these mashas are expressly forbidden; for\nit is said, Aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya vai masha _h_ , 'Mashas are not fit for\nsacrifice.'\n\n136\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXXVI.\n\nThe substitute should take the nature of that for which it is substituted.\n\n136c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nTaddharma, having the same qualities. If, for instance, nivara has been\nsubstituted for vrihi, it should be treated as if it were vrihi. The name\nvrihi should remain, and should not be replaced by nivara, just as Soma, if\nreplaced by putika, is still called Soma. Thus, when in the course of a\nsacrifice vrihi has once been replaced by nivara, and vrihi can be procured\nafterwards, yet nivara is then to be retained to the end. If, however, the\nsubstituted nivara also come to an end, and afterwards both nivara and vrihi\nare forthcoming, then vrihi has the preference. If neither be forthcoming,\nthen some substitute is to be taken that approaches nearest to the substitute,\nthe nivara, not to the\n\np. 353\n\noriginal vrihi. Further, if a choice has been allowed between vrihi, rice, and\nyava, barley, and vrihi has been chosen, and afterwards, as substitute for\nvrihi, nivara, then, if nivara come to an end, and in the absence of vrihi,\nwhen a new supply of both nivara, and yava has been obtained, the yava is to\nbe avoided, and the original substitute for vrihi, the nivara, must be\nretained. In most of these cases, however, a certain penance also (praya _s_\n_k_ itta) is required.\n\n137\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXXVII.\n\nIf something is wanting in the measure, let him finish with the rest.\n\n137c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIf it is said that a puro _d_ a _s_ a should be as large as a horse's hoof,\nand there is not quite so much left, yet whatever is left should be used to\nfinish the offering.\n\n138\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXXVIII.\n\nSubstitution does not apply to the master, the altar-fire, the deity, the\nword, the act, and a prohibition.\n\n138c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe master is meant for the sacrificer himself and his wife. Their place\ncannot, of course, be taken by anybody else. The altar-fire is supposed to\nhave a supernatural power, and cannot be replaced by any other fire. Nothing\ncan take the place of the invoked deities, nor of the words used in the\nmantras addressed to them, nor can the sacrifice itself be replaced by any\nother act. Lastly, when it is said that mashas, varakas, kodravas are not fit\nfor sacrifice, or that a man ought not to sacrifice with what should not be\neaten by \xc3\x82ryas, nothing else can be substituted for what is thus prohibited.\n\n139\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXXXIX.\n\nThe Prak _ri_ ti stops from three causes, from a corollary, from a\nprohibition, and from loss of purpose.\n\np. 354\n\n139c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nA corollary (pratyamnana) occurs, when it is said, 'instead of Ku _s_ a grass,\nlet him make a barhis of reeds.' A prohibition (pratishedha) occurs, when it\nis said, 'he does not choose an \xc3\x82rsheya.' Loss of purpose (arthalopa) occurs,\nwhen pesha _n_ a, pounding, would refer to _k_ aru, a pulse, that cannot be\npounded, while grains can be.\n\n140\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXL.\n\nThe Agnish _t_ oma is the Prak _ri_ ti of the Ekaha sacrifices.\n\n140c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Ekaha are sacrifices accomplished in one day.\n\n141\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXLI.\n\nThe Dvada _s_ aha is the Prak _ri_ ti of the Aharga _n_ as.\n\n141c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Dvada _s_ aha lasts twelve days and is a Soma sacrifice. It is either an\nAhina or a Sattra. An Aharga _n_ a is a series of daily and nightly\nsacrifices. Those which last from two nights to eleven nights are called\nAhina. Those which last from thirteen to one hundred nights or more are called\nSattras.\n\n142\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXLII.\n\nThe Gavamayana is the Prak _ri_ ti of the Sa _m_ vatsarikas.\n\n142c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Gavamayana lasts three years, and it is the type of all Sa _m_ vatsarika\nsacrifices, whether they last one, two, three or more years. They all belong\nto the class of Sattras.\n\n143\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXLIII.\n\nOf the Nikayi sacrifices the first serves as Prak _ri_ ti.\n\np. 355\n\n143c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nAmong the Nikayi sacrifices, lit. those which consist of a number, all having\nthe same name, but different rewards, the first is the prak _ri_ ti of the\nsubsequent ones. The commentator calls them sadyaskra &c., and mentions as the\nfirst the Agnish _t_ oma. See Sutra CXLVI, and Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 218.\n\n144\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXLIV.\n\nAt the Agnish _t_ oma there is the Uttara-vedi.\n\n144c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe commentator explains this by saying that at the Soma sacrifices, i.e. at\nthe Agnish _t_ oma, Ukthya, Sho _d_ a _s_ in, and Atiratra, the fire is\ncarried from the \xc3\x82havaniya to the Uttara-vedi, which is also called the Soma\naltar.\n\n145\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXLV.\n\nThe fire is valid for the successive sacrifices.\n\n145c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis fire refers to the fire on the Uttara-vedi, mentioned in the preceding\nSutra, and the object of the Sutra seems to be to include the act of lighting\nthe fire on the Uttara-vedi in the Prak _ri_ ti, though properly speaking it\ndoes not form part of the Agnish _t_ oma. But I cannot quite understand the\nargument of the commentator.\n\n146\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXLVI.\n\nThis does not apply to the Sadyaskras, the Va _g_ apeya, the Sho _d_ a _s_ in,\nand the Sarasvata Sattra.\n\n146c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nWith regard to the Sho _d_ a _s_ in and its vikara, the Va _g_ apeya, the\nlaying of the fire is not mentioned. In the case of the Sadyaskras, it becomes\nimpossible, because they have to be quickly finished. In the case of the\nSarasvata Sattra, there is the same difficulty on account of not remaining in\nthe same place (anavasthapan nagni _s_ _k_ iyate).\n\np. 356\n\n147\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXLVII.\n\nA sacrificer wishes the object of his sacrifice at the beginning of the\nsacrifice.\n\n147c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nSome MSS. read kamayeta, 'he should wish,' but the commentator explains that\nsuch a command (vidhi) is unnecessary, because it is natural to form a wish\n(svata _h_ siddhatvat).\n\n148\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXLVIII.\n\nAt the beginning of a special part of the sacrifice, one should wish the\nobject of that part of the sacrifice.\n\n148c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe commentary, though objecting, and objecting rightly, to kamayeta, 'he\nshould wish,' in the preceding Sutra, accepts kamayeta as determining the\npresent Sutra, saying kamayetety anuvartate. One should read ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\na\xe1\xb9\x85gakamam, not ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ akamam, for the commentary explains it by ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\na\xe1\xb9\x85gaphalasa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa _h_. Whether it was really intended that there should be a\nspecial wish for each part or subsidiary act of a sacrifice (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ga),\nis another question, but the commentator evidently thought so.\n\nKatyayana, who treats the same subject (1, 2, 10 seq.), states that there\nshould be this desire for a reward for certain sacrifices which are offered\nfor a certain purpose, as, for instance, the Dvada _s_ aha, but that there are\nno such motives for other sacrifices, and parts of sacrifices. He mentions,\nfirst of all, a niyama, a precept for the sacrifice, such as 'Speak the\ntruth.' Then a nimitta, a special cause, as when some accident has taken place\nthat must be remedied, for instance, when the house has been burnt down, &c.\nThirdly, the Agnihotra, the morning and evening Homa; fourthly, the Dar _s_\na-pur _n_ amasau; fifthly, the Dakshaya _n_ a, a vik _ri_ ti of the Dar _s_\na-pur _n_ amasau, the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a; sixthly, the Niru _dh_ a-pa _s_ u, the\nanimal sacrifice. All these have to be performed as a sacred\n\np. 357\n\nduty, and without any view to special rewards. Thus we read in Vasish _th_ a:\n\nAva _s_ yam brahma _n_ o\xe0\xa4\xbdgnin adadhita, dar _s_ apur _n_ amasagraya _n_ esh\n_t_ i _k_ aturmasyapa _s_ usomai _s_ _k_ a ya _g_ eta, 'A Brahma _n_ a should\nwithout fail place his fires, and offer the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa, the \xc3\x82graya\n_n_ esh _t_ i, the Katurmasyas, the P a _s_ u, and the Soma sacrifices.'\n\nHarita says: Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ an ya _g_ en nitya _m_ havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _m_ _s_\n_k_ a nitya _s_ a _h_ , Soma _m_ _s_ _k_ a vidhipurve _n_ a ya i _k_ _kh_ ed\ndharmam avyayam, 'Let a man offer the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as always, always also\nthe Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, and the Soma sacrifices, according to rule, if he\nwishes for eternal merit.' The object of these sacrifices is aparimitani _h_\n_s_ reyasarupamoksha, eternal happiness, and hence they have to be performed\nduring life at certain seasons, without any special occasion (nimitta), and\nwithout any special object (kama). According to most authorities, however,\nthey have to be performed during thirty years only. After that the Agnihotra\nonly has to be kept up. The proper seasons for these sacrifices are given by\nManu, IV, 25-27:\n\nA Brahma _n_ a shall always offer the Agnihotra at the beginning or at the end\nof the day and of the night, and the Dar _s_ a and Paur _n_ amasa (ish _t_ is)\nat the end of each half-month;\n\n'When the old grain has been consumed the (\xc3\x82graya _n_ a) Ish _t_ i with new\ngrain; at the end of the (three) seasons the ( _K_ aturmasya) sacrifices; at\nthe solstices an animal (sacrifice); at the end of the year Soma offerings;\n\n'A Brahma _n_ a, who keeps sacred fires, shall, if he desires to live long,\nnot eat new grain or meat, without having offered the (\xc3\x82graya _n_ a) Ish _t_ i\nwith new grain and an animal (sacrifice) 1.'\n\nThese Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as or ish _t_ is, and Soma sacrifices\nare enumerated by Gautama 2, as follows:\n\np. 358\n\nSeven  \nPakasa _m_ sthas:\n\n|\n\nSeven  \nHavirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asa _m_ sthas:\n\n|\n\nSeven  \nSomasa _m_ sthas:  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n(1) Ash _t_ aka,\n\n|\n\n(1) Agnyadheyam,\n\n|\n\n(1) Agnish _t_ oma _h_ ,  \n  \n(2) Parva _n_ am,\n\n|\n\n(2) Agnihotram,\n\n|\n\n(2) Atyagnish _t_ oma _h_ ,  \n  \n(3) _S_ raddham,\n\n|\n\n(3) Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasau,\n\n|\n\n(3) Ukthya _h_ ,  \n  \n(4) _S_ rava _n_ i,\n\n|\n\n(4) _K_ aturmasyani 1,\n\n|\n\n(4) Sho _d_ a _s_ i 2,  \n  \n(5) \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i,\n\n|\n\n(5) \xc3\x82graya _n_ esh _t_ i _h_ ,\n\n|\n\n(5) Va _g_ apeya _h_ ,  \n  \n(6) _K_ aitri,\n\n|\n\n(6) Niru _dh_ apa _s_ ubandha _h_ ,\n\n|\n\n(6) Atiratra _h_ ,  \n  \n(7) \xc3\x82 _s_ vayu _g_ i.\n\n|\n\n(7) Sautrama _n_ i.\n\n|\n\n(7) Aptoryama _h_.  \n  \nIn a commentary on Dhurtasvamin's \xc3\x82pastambasutrabhashya (MS. E.I.H. 137)\nanother list is given:\n\nPakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as:\n\n|\n\nHavirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as:\n\n|\n\nSomaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as:  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n(1) Aupasanahoma _h_ ,\n\n|\n\nAgnihotram,\n\n|\n\nAgnish _t_ oma _h_ ,  \n  \n(2) Vai _s_ vadevam,\n\n|\n\nDar _s_ apur _n_ amasau,\n\n|\n\nAtyagnish _t_ oma _h_ ,  \n  \n(3) Parva _n_ am,\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x82graya _n_ am,\n\n|\n\nUkthya _h_ ,  \n  \n(4) Ash _t_ aka,\n\n|\n\n_K_ aturmasyani,\n\n|\n\nSho _d_ a _s_ i,  \n  \n(5) Masi _s_ raddham,\n\n|\n\nNiru _dh_ apa _s_ ubandha _h_ ,\n\n|\n\nVa _g_ apeya _h_ ,  \n  \n(6) Sarpabali _h_ ,\n\n|\n\nSautrama _n_ i,\n\n|\n\nAtiratra _h_ ,  \n  \n(7) \xc3\x8e _s_ anabali _h_.\n\n|\n\nPi _n_ _d_ apit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_.\n\n|\n\nAptoryama _h_.  \n  \nThis list is nearly the same as one given by Satyavrata Sama _s_ rami in the\nUsha. He gives, however, another list, which is:\n\nSeven  \nPakasa _m_ sthas:\n\n|\n\nSeven  \nHavi _h_ sa _m_ sthas:\n\n|\n\nSeven  \nSomasa _m_ sthas:  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n(1) Saya _m_ homa _h_ ,\n\n|\n\nAgnyadheyam,\n\n|\n\nAgnish _t_ oma _h_ ,  \n  \n(2) Pratarhoma _h_ ,\n\n|\n\nAgnihotram,\n\n|\n\nAtyagnish _t_ oma _h_ ,  \n  \n(3) Sthalipaka,\n\n|\n\nDar _s_ a-,\n\n|\n\nUkthya _h_ ,  \n  \n(4) Navaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_ ,\n\n|\n\nPaur _n_ amasau,\n\n|\n\nSho _d_ a _s_ i,  \n  \n(5) Vai _s_ vadevam,\n\n|\n\n\xc3\x82graya _n_ a,\n\n|\n\nVa _g_ apeya _h_ ,  \n  \n(6) Pit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_ ,\n\n|\n\n_K_ aturmasyani,\n\n|\n\nAtiratra _h_ ,  \n  \n(7) Ash _t_ aka.\n\n|\n\nPa _s_ ubandha _h_.\n\n|\n\nAptoryama _h_.  \n  \nAccording to the substances offered, sacrifices are sometimes\n\np. 359\n\ndivided into vegetable and animal sacrifices. The vegetable substances are, ta\n_n_ _d_ ula _h_ , pish _t_ ani, phalikara _n_ a _h_ , puro _d_ a _s_ a _h_ ,\nodana _h_ , yavagu _h_ , p _ri_ thuka _h_ , la _g_ a _h_ , dhana _h_ , and\naktava _h_. The animal substances are, paya _h_ , dadhi, a _g_ yam, amiksha,\nva _g_ inam, vapa, tva _k_ a _h_ , ma _m_ sam, lohitam, and pa _s_ urasa _h_.\n\n149\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CXLIX.\n\nIf there are fewer Mantras and more (sacrificial) acts, then after dividing\nthem into equal parts, let him perform the former with the former, the latter\nwith the latter.\n\n149c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIt happens, for instance, in certain ish _t_ is that a pair of Ya _g_ ya and\nAnuvakya mantras is given, but six acts. In that case one half of the mantras\nis used for one half of the acts, and the other half of the mantras for the\nother half of the acts.\n\n150\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA CL.\n\nIf there are fewer acts and more Mantras, let him perform and act with one\nmantra, those which remain are optional, as the materials for the sacrificial\npost.\n\n150c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nKapardisvamin seems to have divided this Sutra into three, the second being\nava _s_ ish _t_ a vikalpartha _h_ , the third yatha yupadravya _n_ iti. But it\nis better to take it as one, as it is in MS. 1676.\n\nIf there are, for instance, fourteen vapanas, while there are many more\nmantras, let him select fourteen mantras and use them for each vapana, while\nthe rest will be useful for another performance. A similar case occurs when\ndifferent kinds of wood are recommended for making the sacrificial post, or\nwhen rice or barley are recommended for an offering. Here a choice has to be\nmade. The iti at the end is explained as showing that there are other\ninstances of the same kind.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[357:1](sbe30124.htm#fr_799) See Manu, transl. by Buhler, S.B.E., XXV, who\nquotes to the same purpose Gaut.
