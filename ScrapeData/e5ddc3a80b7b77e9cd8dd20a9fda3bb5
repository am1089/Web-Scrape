And on account of observation.\n\nIt is, moreover, observed that out of the four classes of organic beings--\nviviparous animals, oviparous animals, animals springing from heat, and beings\nspringing from germs (plants)--the two latter classes are produced without\nsexual intercourse, so that in their case no regard is had to the number of\noblations. The same may therefore take place in other cases also.--But, an\nobjection may here be raised, scripture speaks of those beings as belonging to\nthree classes only, because there are three modes of origin only; 'That which\nsprings from an egg, that which springs from a living being, that which\nsprings from a germ' ( _Kh_.
