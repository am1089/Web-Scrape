 \nI came by night to fill my jar  \nFrom this lone stream where no men are.  \nAh, who this deadly shaft has shot  \nWhom have I wronged, and knew it not?  \nWhy should a boy so harmless feel  \nThe vengeance of the winged steel?  \nOr who should slay the guiltless son  \nOf hermit sire who injures none,  \nWho dwells retired in woods, and there  \nSupports his life on woodland fare?  \nAh me, ah me, why am I slain,  \nWhat booty will the murderer gain?  \nIn hermit coils I bind my hair,  \nCoats made of skin and bark I wear.  \nAh, who the cruel deed can praise  \nWhose idle toil no fruit repays,  \nAs impious as the wretch's crime  \nWho dares his master's bed to climb?  \nNor does my parting spirit grieve  \nBut for the life which thus I leave:  \nAlas, my mother and my sire,--  \nI mourn for them when I expire.  \nAh me, that aged, helpless pair,  \nLong cherished by my watchful care,  \nHow will it be with them this day  \nWhen to the Five 1 I pass away?  \nPierced by the self-same dust we die,  \nMine aged mother, sire, and I.  \nWhose mighty hand, whose lawless mind  \nHas all the three to death consigned!'  \n\nWhen I, by love of duty stirred,  \nThat touching lamentation heard,  \n\nPierced to the heart by sudden woe,  \nI threw to earth my shafts and bow.  \nMy heart was full of grief and dread  \nAs swiftly to the place I sped,  \nWhere, by my arrow wounded sore,  \nA hermit lay on Sarju's shore.  \nHis matted hair was all unbound.  \nHis pitcher empty on the ground,  \nAnd by the fatal arrow pained,  \nHe lay with dust and gore distained.  \nI stood confounded and amazed:  \nHis dying eyes to mine he raised,  \nAnd spoke this speech in accents stern,  \nAs though his light my soul would burn:  \n'How have I wronged thee, King, that I  \nStruck by thy mortal arrow die?  \nThe wood my home, this jar I brought,  \nAnd water for my parents sought.  \nThis one keen shaft that strikes me through  \nSlays sire and aged mother too.  \nFeeble and blind, in helpless pain,  \nThey wait for me and thirst in vain.  \nThey with parched lips their pangs must bear,  \nAnd hope will end in blank despair.  \nAh me, there seems no fruit in store  \nFor holy zeal or Scripture lore,  \nOr else ere now my sire would know  \nThat his dear son is lying low.  \nYet, if my mournful fate he knew,  \nWhat could his arm so feeble do?  \nThe tree, firm-rooted, ne'er may be  \nThe guardian of a stricken tree.  \nHaste to my father, and relate  \nWhile time allows, my sudden fate,  \nLest he consume thee as the fire  \nBurns up the forest, in his ire.  \nThis little path, O King, pursue:  \nMy father's cot thou soon wilt view.  \nThere sue for pardon to the sage.  \nLest he should curse thee in his rage.  \nFirst from the wound extract the dart  \nThat kills me with its deadly smart,  \nE'en as the flushed impetuous tide  \nEats through the river's yielding side.'  \n\nI feared to draw the arrow out,  \nAnd pondered thus in painful doubt:  \n'Now tortured by the shaft he lies,  \nBut if I draw it forth he dies.'  \nHelpless I stood, faint, sorely grieved:  \nThe hermit's son my thought perceived;  \nAs one o'ercome by direst pain  \nHe scarce had strength to speak again.  \nWith writhing limb and struggling breath,  \nNearer and ever nearer death  \nMy senses undisturbed remain,  \nAnd fortitude has conquered pain:  \nNow from one tear thy soul be freed.  \nThy hand has made a Brahman bleed.  \nLet not this pang thy bosom wring:  \nNo twice-born youth am I, O King,  \n\np. 170  \n\nFor of a Vais'ya sire I came,  \nWho wedded with a S'udra dame.  \n\nThese words the boy could scarcely say,  \nAs tortured by the shaft he lay.  \nTwisting his helpless body round,  \nThen trembling senseless on the ground.  \nThen from his bleeding side I drew  \nThe rankling shaft that pierced him through.  \nWith death's last fear my face he eyed,  \nAnd, rich in store of penance, died.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[168:1](ry141.htm#fr_335) The southern region is the abode of Yama the Indian\nPluto, and of departed spirits.\n\n[169:1](ry141.htm#fr_336) The five elements of which the body consists, and to\nwhich it returns.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXIV.: Das'aratha's Death.](ry142.htm)\n\n"
