The rules now following refer in the first instance\nto the Parva _n_ a or monthly _S_ raddha, but most of them serve also as\ngeneral rules for all the numerous varieties of funeral sacrifices.\n\n[255:2](sbe0279.htm#fr_1239) Manu III, 122; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 217.\n\n[255:3](sbe0279.htm#fr_1240) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 16, 6.\n\n[255:4](sbe0279.htm#fr_1241) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 16, 6-2 2.\n\n[255:5](sbe0279.htm#fr_1242) Some of the most famous among the places where\nthe performance of a _S_ raddha is particularly efficacious and meritorious\nare Gaya in Bihar, Pushkara or Pokhar near Agmir, the Kurukshetra near Dehli,\nNasika on the Godavari. Pilgrims or persons passing through such places may\nand must perform a _S_ raddha on any day of the month.\n\n[255:7](sbe0279.htm#fr_1243) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 227.\n\n[255:8](sbe0279.htm#fr_1244) See also below, Sutra 21.\n\n[255:9](sbe0279.htm#fr_1245) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 17, 4. Haradatta explains vak,\n\'eloquence,\' by \'ability to speak Sanskrit,\' rupa, \'beauty,\' by \'the proper\nnumber of limbs,\' and vaya _h_ sampanna, \'of (suitable) age,\' by \'not too\nyoung.\'\n\n[256:11](sbe0279.htm#fr_1246) I.e. in honour of the father a young man is to\nbe invited, in honour of the grandfather an old man, and in honour of the\ngreat-grandfather a very old man.\n\n[256:12](sbe0279.htm#fr_1247) \xc3\x82pastamba II. 7, 17, 4, 8; Manu III, 140.\n\n[256:15](sbe0279.htm#fr_1248) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 16, 23-11, 7, 17, 3; 11, 8, 18,\n13.\n\n[256:16](sbe0279.htm#fr_1249) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 17, 21. \'A destroyer of the\nsacred fire (virahan), i.e. one who extinguishes intentionally the (domestic)\nfire p. 257 out of hatred against his wife, and for the like reasons.\'--\nHaradatta. He also remarks that some read agredidhishu instead of\nagredidhishu, and he proposes to explain the former, on the authority of\nVyaghra and of the Naigha _n_ _t_ ukas, as \'a Brahma _n_ a whose wife has been\nwedded before to another man.\'\n\n[257:17](sbe0279.htm#fr_1250) My MSS. make two Sutras out of Professor\nStenzler\'s one, and read upapati _h_ | yasya _k_ a sa _h_. The sense remains\nthe same, but the latter version of the text is, I think, the correct one.\n\n[257:18](sbe0279.htm#fr_1251) Haradatta says that ku _n_ _d_ asin may also\nmean \'he who eats out of a vessel called ku _n_ _d_ a,\' as the people have in\nsome countries the habit of preparing their food and afterwards eating out of\nthe ku _n_ _d_ a. Haradatta explains tyaktatman, \'one who despairs of\nhimself,\' by \'one who has made an attempt on his own life, and has tried to\nhang himself, and the like.\' He remarks that some explain durvala, \'a bald\nman,\' by nirvesh _t_ ita _s_ epha. He who neglects the recitation of the\nsacred texts, i.e. of those texts which, like the Gayatri, ought to be\nrecited.\n\n[258:19](sbe0279.htm#fr_1252) Below, XXVIII, 2, it will be prescribed that the\ndivision of the family estate may take place during the lifetime of the father\nwith his consent. From this Sutra it would appear that sons could enforce a\ndivision of the ancestral estate against his will, as Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya also\nallows (see Colebrooke, Mitakshara I, 6, 5-11), and that this practice, though\nlegal, was held to be contra bonos mores.\n\n[258:20](sbe0279.htm#fr_1253) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 17, 5-6.\n\n[258:21](sbe0279.htm#fr_1254) According to Haradatta, this Sutra is intended\nas a modification of Sutra 8.\n\n[258:22](sbe0279.htm#fr_1255) Manu III, 250. 23. Manu III, 188.\n\n[259:24](sbe0279.htm#fr_1256) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 17, 20.\n\n[259:28](sbe0279.htm#fr_1257) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 17, 22.\n\n[259:29](sbe0279.htm#fr_1258)-30. Manu III, 132-137, 148-149.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVI](sbe0280.htm)\n\n'
