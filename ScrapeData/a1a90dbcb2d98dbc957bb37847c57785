When the victims have been bound (to the stakes), the Adhvaryu\ntakes the sprinkling-water in order to sprinkle the horse. Whilst the\nSacrificer holds on to him behind, he (in sprinkling the horse) runs rapidly\nthrough the formula used at the Soma-sacrifice 2, and then commences the one\nfor the A _s_ vamedha.\n\n13:2:7:22\\. [Va _g_. S. XXIII, 13,] 'May Vayu favour thee with cooked kinds of\nfood 3,'--Vayu (the wind) indeed cooks it 4;--'the dark-necked one with he-\ngoats,'--the dark-necked one, doubtless,\n\np. 317\n\nis Agni (the fire); and the fire indeed cooks it (the horse) together with the\nhe-goats.\n\n13:2:7:33\\. 'The Nyagrodha with cups,'--for when the gods were performing\nsacrifice, they tilted over those Soma-cups, and, turned downwards, they took\nroot, whence the Nyagrodhas (ficus indica), when turned downwards (nya _k_ ),\ntake root (roha 1).\n\n13:2:7:44\\. 'The cotton-tree with growth,'--he confers growth on the cotton-\ntree (salmalia malabarica), whence the cotton-tree grows largest amongst trees\n2.\n\n13:2:7:55\\. 'This male, fit for the chariot,'--he supplies the chariot with a\nhorse, whence the horse draws nothing else than a chariot.\n\n13:2:7:66\\. 'Hath come hither on his four feet,'--therefore the horse, when\nstanding, stands on three feet, but, when harnessed, it pulls with all its\nfeet at one and the same time.\n\n13:2:7:77\\. 'May the spotless Brahman protect us!'--the spotless 3 Brahman\n(m.), doubtless, is the moon:\n\np. 318\n\nto the moon he thus commits it;--'Reverence to Agni!'--to Agni he thus makes\nreverence.\n\n13:2:7:88\\. [Va _g_. S. XXIII, 14,] 'Trimmed up is the car with the cord,'--\nwith cord one indeed completes the car 1, whence a car, when enveloped (with\ncords 2), is very handsome.\n\n13:2:7:99\\. 'Trimmed up is the steed with the rein,'--with the rein one indeed\ncompletes the horse, whence the horse, when curbed by the rein, looks most\nbeautiful.\n\n13:2:7:1010\\. 'Trimmed up in the waters was the water-born,'--the horse,\nindeed, has sprung from the womb of the waters 3: with its own (mother's) womb\nhe thus supplies it;--'Brahman (m.), with Soma for his leader,'--he thus makes\nit go to heaven with Soma for its leader.\n\n13:2:7:1111\\. [Va _g_. S. XXIII, 15,1 'Thyself, fit out thy body, O\nracer,'--'Take thyself the form which thou wishest,' he thereby says to\nhim;--'make offering thyself,'--sovereign rule (independence) he thereby\nconfers on it;--'rejoice thou thyself,'--'enjoy (rule) thou thyself the world\nas far as thou wishest,' he thereby says to him;--'thy glory is not to be\nequalled by any one!'--with glory he thereby endows the horse.\n\n13:2:7:1212\\. [Va _g_ : S. XXIII, 16 4,] 'Thou shalt not die\n\np. 319\n\nhere, neither suffer harm,'--he thereby cheers it;--'on easy paths thou goest\nto the gods,'--he thereby shows him the paths leading to the gods;--'where\ndwell the pious, whither they have gone,'--he thereby makes it one who shares\nthe same world with the pious;--'thither the god Savit _ri_ shall lead thee,'\n--it is, indeed, Savit _ri_ that leads him to the heavenly world.--Whilst\nwhispering 1 'I sprinkle thee, acceptable unto Pra _g_ apati,' he then holds\n(the sprinkling water) under (its mouth).\n\n13:2:7:1313\\. [Va _g_. S. XXIII, 17,] 'Agni was an animal; they sacrificed\nhim, and he gained that world wherein Agni (ruleth): that shall be thy world,\nthat thou shalt gain,--drink thou this water!'--'As great as Agni's conquest\nwas, as great as is his world, as great as is his lordship, so great shall be\nthy conquest, so great thy world, so great thy lordship,' this is what he\nthereby says to him.\n\n13:2:7:1414\\. 'Vayu was an animal; they sacrificed him, and he gained that\nworld wherein. Vayu (ruleth): that shall be thy world, that thou shalt gain,--\ndrink thou this water!'--'As great as Vayu's conquest was, as great as is his\nworld, as great as is his lordship, so great shall be thy conquest, so great\nthy world, so great thy lordship,' this is what he thereby says to him.\n\np. 320\n\n13:2:7:1515\\. 'Surya was an animal; they sacrificed him, and he gained that\nworld wherein Surya (ruleth): that shall be thy world, that thou shalt gain,--\ndrink thou this water!'--'As great as Surya's conquest was, as great as is his\nworld, as great as is his lordship, so great shall be thy conquest, so great\nthy world, so great thy lordship,' this is what he thereby says to him. Having\nsatisfied the horse, and consecrated again the sprinkling water, he sprinkles\nthe other victims: thereof hereafter.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[316:1](sbe44088.htm#fr_807) Here the original text in Va _g_. S. XXIII, 12,\nhas simply 'the pi _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85gila was the night.' Mahidhara explains 'pi _s_\na\xe1\xb9\x85gila' by 'pi _s_ a _m_ gila,' 'beauty-devouring,' inasmuch as the night\nswallows, or conceals, all beauty (or form). Neither this nor the other\nexplanation (= pi _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ga, ruddy-brown) suits the day; but Harisvamin, who\ndoes not explain the name, remarks that the night here is taken to include the\nday. Cf. [XIII, 5, 2, 18](sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:18).\n\n[316:2](sbe44089.htm#fr_808) Viz. Va _g_. S. VI, 9; see III, 7, 4, 4-5.\n\n[316:3](sbe44089.htm#fr_809) The author seems to take 'pa _k_ atai _h_ ' in\nthe sense of 'cooking.'\n\n[316:4](sbe44089.htm#fr_810) Viz. inasmuch as it causes the fire to blaze up,\ncomm.\n\n[317:1](sbe44089.htm#fr_811) Or, whence the Nyagrodhas grow downwards. This\nrefers to the habit of the Indian fig-tree, of sending down from the branches\nnumerous slender roots which afterwards become fresh stems. Cp. the\ncorresponding legend in Ait. Br. VII, 30, told there by way of explaining why\nKshatriyas, being forbidden to drink Soma, should drink the juice extracted\nfrom the descending roots of the Indian fig-tree. Another reason why the\nIndian fig-tree (also called 'va _t_ a') is here connected with the priests'\nSoma-cups ( _k_ amasa), is that this is one of the kinds of wood used in\nmaking those cups (cf. Katy, I, 3, 36 comm.).\n\n[317:2](sbe44089.htm#fr_812) According to Stewart and Brandis, Forest Flora,\np. 31, the cotton-tree (or silk-cotton tree) is a very large tree of rapid\ngrowth, attaining a height of 150 ft., and a girth of 40 ft.\n\n[317:3](sbe44089.htm#fr_813) Lit. 'the non-black Brahman,' explained as one\nwho has no black spots; though it is difficult to see why the moon should be\nfavoured with this epithet.\n\n[318:1](sbe44089.htm#fr_814) In Indian vehicles the different parts are held\ntogether by cords. For a drawing see Sir H. M. Elliot, The Races of the N.W.\nProvinces. of India, II, p. 342. The word for 'cord' and 'rein' is the same in\nSanskrit.\n\n[318:2](sbe44089.htm#fr_815) Paryuta _h_ = parivesh _t_ ito ra _g_ _g_ ubhi\n_h_ , comm.; hardly 'hung all round (with ornaments),' as the St. Petersb.\nDict. takes it.\n\n[318:3](sbe44089.htm#fr_816) See V, 1, 4, 5; VI, 1, 1, 11.\n\n[318:4](sbe44089.htm#fr_817) The first two padas of this verse form the first\nhalf-verse of _Ri_ g-veda S. I, 162, 21.\n\n[319:1](sbe44089.htm#fr_818) Cp. I, 4, 5, 12: 'Hence whatever at the sacrifice\nis performed for Pra _g_ apati, that is performed in a low voice (under the\nbreath); for speech would not act as oblation-bearer for Pra _g_ apati.' Pra\n_g_ apati, as representing generation, is often spoken of as 'undefined' or\n'unexpressed (secret)'; and so is what is muttered in a low voice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 2, 8.
