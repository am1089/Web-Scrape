Manifest, near, moving in the cave (of the heart) is the great Being. In\nit everything is centred which ye know as moving, breathing, and blinking, as\nbeing and not-being, as adorable, as the best, that is beyond the\nunderstanding of creatures.\n\n2\\. That which is brilliant, smaller than small, that on which the worlds are\nfounded and their inhabitants, that is the indestructible Brahman, that is the\nbreath, speech, mind; that is the true, that is the immortal. That is to be\nhit. Hit it, O friend!\n\n3\\. Having taken the Upanishad as the bow, as the great weapon, let him place\non it the arrow, sharpened by devotion! Then having drawn it with a thought\ndirected to that which is, hit the mark, O friend, viz. that which is the\nIndestructible!\n\n4\\. Om is the bow, the Self is the arrow, Brahman is called its aim. It is to\nbe hit by a man who is not thoughtless; and then, as the arrow (becomes one\nwith the target), he will become one with Brahman.\n\n5\\. In him the heaven, the earth, and the sky are woven, the mind also with\nall the senses. Know him alone as the Self, and leave off other words! He is\nthe bridge of the Immortal.\n\n6\\. He moves about becoming manifold within the heart where the arteries meet,\nlike spokes fastened to the nave. Meditate on the Self as Om! Hail to you,\nthat you may cross beyond (the sea of) darkness!\n\n7\\. He who understands all and who knows all, he to whom all this glory in the\nworld belongs, the\n\np. 37\n\nSelf, is placed in the ether, in the heavenly city of Brahman (the heart). He\nassumes the nature of mind, and becomes the guide of the body of the senses.\nHe subsists in food, in close proximity to the heart. The wise who understand\nthis, behold the Immortal which shines forth full of bliss.\n\n8\\. The fetter of the heart is broken, all doubts are solved, all his works\n(and their effects) perish when He has been beheld who is high and low (cause\nand effect) 1.\n\n9\\. In the highest golden sheath there is the Brahman without passions and\nwithout parts. That is pure, that is the light of lights, that is it which\nthey know who know the Self.\n\n10\\. The 2 sun does not thine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor these\nlightnings, and much less this fire. When he shines, everything shines after\nhim; by his light all this is lighted 3.\n\n11\\. That immortal Brahman is before, that Brahman is behind, that Brahman is\nright and left. It has gone forth below and above; Brahman alone is all this,\nit is the best.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[37:1](sbe15019.htm#fr_177) Cf. Ka _th_. Up.
