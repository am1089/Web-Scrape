Some (maintain the non-existence) of a (separate) Self, on account of the\nexistence (of the Self) where a body is (only).\n\nAt present we will prove the existence of a Self different from the body in\norder to establish thereby the qualification (of the Self) for bondage and\nrelease. For if there were no Self different from the body, there would be no\nroom for injunctions that have the other world for their result; nor could it\nbe taught of anybody that Brahman is his Self.--But, an objection is raised,\nalready in the first pada which stands at the head of this Sastra (i.e. the\nfirst pada of the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras) there has been declared the\nexistence of a Self which is different from the body and hence capable of\nenjoying the fruits taught by the Sastra.--True, this has been declared there\nby the author of the bhashya, but there is in that place no Sutra about the\nexistence of the Self. Here, on the other hand, the Sutrakara himself\nestablishes the existence of the Self after having disposed of a preliminary\nobjection. And from hence the teacher _S_ abara Svamin has taken the matter\nfor his discussion of the point in the chapter treating of the means of right\nknowledge. For the same reason the reverend Upavarsha remarks in the first\ntantra--where an opportunity offers itself for the discussion of the existence\nof the Self--'We will discuss this in the _S_ ariraka,' and allows the matter\nto rest there. Here, where we are engaged in an inquiry into the pious\nmeditations which are matter of injunction, a discussion of the existence of\nthe Self is introduced in order to show that the whole Sastra depends thereon.\n\nMoreover, in the preceding adhikara _n_ a we have shown that passages may be\nexempted from the influence of the leading subject-matter, and that for that\nreason the fire-altars\n\np. 269\n\nbuilt of mind and so on subserve the purpose of man (not of the sacrifice). In\nconsequence thereof there naturally arises the question who that man is whose\npurposes the different fire-altars subserve, and in reply to it the existence\nof a Self which is separate from the body is affirmed.--The first Sutra\nembodies an objection against that doctrine; according to the principle that a\nfinal refutation of objections stated in the beginning effects a stronger\nconviction of the truth of the doctrine whose establishment is aimed at.\n\nHere now some materialists (lokayatika), who see the Self in the body only,\nare of opinion that a Self separate from the body does not exist; assume that\nconsciousness ( _k_ aitanya), although not observed in earth and the other\nexternal elements--either single or combined--may yet appear in them when\ntransformed into the shape of a body, so that consciousness springs from them;\nand thus maintain that knowledge is analogous to intoxicating quality (which\narises when certain materials are mixed in certain proportions), and that man\nis only a body qualified by consciousness. There is thus, according to them,\nno Self separate from the body and capable of going to the heavenly world or\nobtaining release, through which consciousness is in the body; but the body\nalone is what is conscious, is the Self. For this assertion they allege the\nreason stated in the Sutra, 'On account of its existence where a body is.' For\nwherever something exists if some other thing exists, and does not exist if\nthat other thing does not exist, we determine the former thing to be a mere\nquality of the latter; light and heat, e.g. we determine to be qualities of\nfire. And as life, movement, consciousness, remembrance and so on--which by\nthe upholders of an independent Self are considered qualities of that Self--\nare observed only within bodies and not outside bodies, and as an abode of\nthose qualities, different from the body, cannot be proved, it follows that\nthey must be qualities of the body only. The Self therefore is not different\nfrom the body.--To this conclusion the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 54](sbe38197.htm)\n\n"
