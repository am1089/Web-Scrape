The\nApsaras are not as a class prominently noticed in the Vedas, but Urvasi and a\nfew others are mentioned by name. In the Institutes of Manu they are said to\nbe the creations of the Seven Manus, the progenitors of mankind. In the Epic\npoems more is said about them--the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana attributing their origin to the\nchurning of the ocean, and with this the Pur\xc4\x81nic account of their origin\nagrees. It is said that when they rose from the waters neither gods nor asuras\nwould wed them, so they became the common property of both classes. They are\nsometimes called "the wives of the gods," and "daughters of pleasure."\n\n"Then from the agitated deep up sprung  \n The legion of Apsarasas, so named  \n That to the watery element they owed  \n Their being. Myriads were they born, and all  \n In vestures heavenly clad, and heavenly gems;  \n Yet more divine their native semblance, rich  \n With all the gifts of grace, of youth and beauty.  \n A train innumerous followed; yet thus fair,  \n Nor god nor demon sought their wedded love;  \n Thus R\xc4\x81ghava! they still remain--their charms  \n The common treasure of the host of heaven."\n\np. 483\n\n"In the Pur\xc4\x81nas various ganas or classes of them are mentioned; the V\xc4\x81yu\nPur\xc4\x81na enumerates fourteen, the Hari Vansa seven. They are again divided, as\nbeing _daivika_ , \'divine,\' or _laukika_ , \'worldly.\' The former are said to\nbe ten in number, and the latter thirty-four, and these are the heavenly\ncharmers who fascinated heroes as Urvasi, allured austere sages from their\ndevotions and penances as Menek\xc4\x81 and Rembh\xc4\x81. The K\xc4\x81si Khand says there are\nforty-five millions of them, but only one thousand and sixty are the\nprincipal. The Apsaras, then, are fairylike beings, beautiful and voluptuous.\nThey are the wives or mistresses of the Gandharvas, and are not prudish in the\ndispensation of their favours. Their amours upon earth have been numerous, and\nthey are the rewards in Indra\'s heaven held out to heroes who fall in battle.\nThey have the power of changing their forms, and give good luck to whom they\nfavour." *\n\nIn the Satapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana is a story, which has been copied into the Pur\xc4\x81nas,\nconcerning Pur\xc5\xabravas and the Apsaras Urvasi which will give some idea of the\ncharacter of these beings. Owing to the imprecation of Indra and Varuna,\nUrvasi was compelled to leave heaven. Pur\xc5\xabravas, son of Budha and a daughter\nof Manu, fell deeply in love with her; and she agreed, on certain conditions,\nto live with him. She said, "I have two rams which must always remain with me,\nboth by day and night; you must never be seen by me undressed; and I must eat\nonly _gh \xc4\xab_, or clarified butter." The inhabitants of heaven being anxious for\nher return, the Gandharvas came at night and carried off her rams. Pur\xc5\xabravas,\nin order to rescue them, rushed into her room hurriedly, without being\ndressed, trusting to the\n\np. 484\n\ndarkness to hide him. Unfortunately a flash of lightning revealed him to her\ngaze, and, the condition of her remaining with him being broken, she returned\nto her celestial home. Pur\xc5\xabravas was distracted at his loss, and wandered from\nplace to place searching for her. At length he was successful in his quest,\nand obtained a promise that she would meet him yearly and present him with a\nson. After five visits, she assured him that if he offered a sacrifice with\nthe express object of gaining her, he would succeed. He followed her advice,\nbecame a Gandharva, and so obtained eternal possession of his strange bride.\n\nThe Gandharvas, according to the Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na, were sons of Brahm\xc4\x81. "The\nGandharvas were next born, imbibing melody; drinking of the goddess of speech,\nthey were born, and thence their appellation. (g\xc4\x81m dhayantah, \'drinking\nspeech\')." * In another place the same Pur\xc4\x81na \xe2\x80\xa0 makes them the offspring of\nKasyapa and Arisht\xc4\x81, and therefore grandchildren of Brahm\xc4\x81. The Padma Pur\xc4\x81na\nspeaks of them as the children of Vach. They are said to be sixty millions in\nnumber. They defeated the N\xc4\x81gas, or snake-gods, seized their jewels, and\nusurped their kingdom. In their distress the snakes resorted to Vishnu, who\npromised to enter into Purukutsa and destroy them. The N\xc4\x81gas sent their sister\nNarmad\xc4\x81 (the river Nerbudda) to ask the help of Purukutsa, who consented to do\nher bidding. As a reward the N\xc4\x81gas gave this power to their sister, that\nwhoever worshipped her and repeated her name should be safe not only from the\npoison of snakes, but other poison too.\n\nIt would appear from the earlier books that the\n\nGandharvas were assistants of Indra, the Storm King,\n\np. 485\n\nand were rewarded by the later writers with a place in his heaven. And as the\ndeities were all provided with a wife or wives, the Gandharvas were not\nneglected in this respect. The beautiful though frail Apsaras were allotted to\nthem, and when Indra was in danger of losing his throne, or the other gods\nwere in a similar plight through the austerity of the devout, some of the more\nattractive were commissioned to visit them and distract their minds.\n\nThe name of these heavenly musicians and their loose matrimonial alliances\nwith the Apsaras has come into common use to designate one of the five forms\nof marriage--that where the mutual consent of man and woman to live together\nis all that is necessary, without any civil or religious ceremony.\n\n##### THE R\xc4\x80KSHASAS.\n\nThese formidable beings are frequently referred to, and their actions\ndescribed at some length in Hindu legend. Though Br\xc4\x81hmans by birth, strange to\nsay they are described as cannibals. The goddess Parvati gave to the whole\ntribe the power to arrive at maturity the moment they were born. They are said\nto be able to assume any form at will; and we read of them appearing as\nhorses, buffaloes, and tigers. Some of them had a hundred heads. Amongst the\nmost noted of them was R\xc4\x81vana, the hereditary foe of Vishnu, who in several\nincarnations left his heavenly home to slay him. The demon reappeared on the\nearth after remaining some years in hell; it was therefore necessary for the\ngod in like manner to revisit the earth to get rid of him. Some of R\xc4\x81vana\'s\nrelatives, such as\n\np. 486\n\n[paragraph continues] Kumbhakarna, Vibhishena, Indrajit, and others, were\nalmost equally notorious.\n\nKumbhakarna, a brother of R\xc4\x81vana, as soon as he was born, stretched forth his\narms, and gathered everything he could reach to stay his hunger. Later on in\nlife, on one occasion he seized five hundred Apsaras, and at another time he\nlaid violent hands on the wives of a hundred sages, besides cows and Br\xc4\x81hmans\ninnumerable. Brahm\xc4\x81 threatened to destroy him unless he moderated his demands.\nFearing he might come to an untimely end, he commenced a life of austerity,\nwhich was to continue ten thousand years. But as this proceeded, the gods\nfeared lest, as a result of such a penance, he should be stronger than ever,\nand, especially that he might obtain immortality and be able to swallow up\neverything, gods and men included. In their distress they appealed to Brahm\xc4\x81,\nwho caused his wife Sarasvati to enter the demon\'s mind, and delude him so far\nas to lead him to ask as a boon that he might sleep for ever. The plan\nsucceeded. But the R\xc4\x81kshasas were not pleased with the result, and asked\nBrahm\xc4\x81, to allow him to awake once in six months for one day only, and then\neat as much as he wished. This request was granted. At one meal he is said to\nhave eaten six thousand cows, ten thousand sheep, ten thousand goats, four\nhundred buffaloes, five thousand deer, and drank four thousand hogsheads of\nspirits, with other things in proportion, and then was angry with his brother\nR\xc4\x81vana for not providing him with more! His home in Ceylon is said to have\nbeen 20,000 miles long, and his bed occupied the full length; but according to\nthe R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana the island itself was only 800 miles in circumference!\n\nWhat can be represented by these monsters? In\n\np. 487\n\n[paragraph continues] Manu, * amongst instructions concerning sacrifice, we\nread: "As a preservative of the oblation to the patriarchs, let the\nhousekeeper begin with an offering to the gods; for the R\xc4\x81kshasas rend in\npieces an oblation which has no such preservative." According to Professor\nWilson these beings may be divided into three classes: "One is of a semi-\ncelestial kind, and is ranked with the attendants of Kuvera, the god of\nwealth; another is a sort of goblin, imp, or ogre, haunting cemeteries,\nanimating dead bodies, disturbing sacrifices, and ensnaring and devouring\nhuman beings; the third kind approaches more to the Titan, or relentless and\npowerful enemy of the gods." Can it be that men, finding it difficult to\nabstain from evil and do good, have invented these mighty beings to represent\nthe forces of evil that are arrayed against them? They are described as eating\ncows and also men, when, according to the ordinary belief of the people, these\nare the greatest imaginable crimes. May this not be a vigorous method of\nteaching that the enemies of God and man will not stop at anything in order to\nsecure success in their work of destruction? It may be that the R\xc4\x81kshasas of\nthe Epics were the rude barbarians of India, who were conquered by the Aryans,\nand their manners of life and religious ceremonies caricatured in this strange\nfashion. Some of the more intelligent were styled monkeys, possibly the more\nsavage were styled R\xc4\x81kshasas.\n\nThe name Bhuta is given to a similar class of beings who are the common\nattendants of Siva; hence. his name of Bhutan\xc4\x81tha, the lord of spirits. The\nterm Pisarch is given to beings similar to, though if possible more offensive\nthan, the R\xc4\x81kshasas.\n\np. 488\n\n##### THE JAIN DEITIES.\n\nAs there are considerable numbers of Jains, chiefly in the north and north-\nwest of India, some account should be given of their objects of worship.\n\nThe origin of this sect is obscure, especially as their chronology is so wild\nand extravagant. Hindu notions of time are reasonable compared with those of\nthe Jains.\n\nIn some respects, there is much in the tenets of this religion that closely\nresembles those of Buddhism. Both reject the divine origin and authority of\nthe Vedas; though when a Vedic text agrees with his own belief, a learned Jain\nwill not scruple to employ it to buttress his own teaching. Both may be\nregarded as heretical sects of Hinduism. Both reject the divine institution of\ncaste, and profess to believe in the social and religious equality of man:\nthough the Jains are not regarded as outside the pale of Hinduism. For when,\nas it sometimes happens, a Jain wishes to worship as an orthodox Hindu, a\nplace is found for him in the caste system; he is not treated as an outcast.\nBoth acknowledge in a general way the more common and modern of the Hindu\ndeities; and very much of the worship of both is very similar to that which\nprevails amongst the Hindus. In both systems a number of saints have been\nraised to the dignity of deities, and have largely taken the place of the\ninferior gods of the Hindu Pantheon. In fact, at one time it was a commonly\nreceived opinion that the Jains were the present-day representatives of the\nBuddhists, But fuller and more correct knowledge has shown that the two\nreligions, though strikingly similar, have distinct and separate origins.\nPossibly they originated about the same time, when there was\n\np. 489\n\nconsiderable religious excitement in India; or it may be, that very soon after\nGautama Buddha commenced his work as a teacher, some of his followers broke\naway from his leadership, and from that time have formed a separate and\nindependent stream. At the present time Jains and Buddhists worship a\nsuccession of deified saints in place of the many gods adored by the Hindus;\nbut in the two systems the names of these saints are quite different. The main\nlines of the religions are very similar, but the differences are sufficiently\ngreat to show that they have run a separate, though to a large extent\nparallel, course.\n\nThe Jain saints belonging to the present age are twenty-four in number; in a\nprevious age there were twenty-four, and in a succeeding age there will be a\nsimilar number. These twenty-four as represented in the temples are seated in\nan attitude of contemplation. In features they greatly resemble each other,\nand in order to distinguish them, they are painted in different colours, and\nhave either their names engraved on their pedestals, or some distinguishing\nsign, commonly an animal by their side. In the stories of their lives there is\nlittle of a distinctive character. But there is this noticeable fact, that in\nheight of stature and in length of life there has been a steady decline. A\nbrief account of the first and last two of these saints, now regarded as\ndivine beings, may be taken as fairly representative of the whole.\n\n1\\. Vrishabha, of the kingly race of Ikohwaku, was son of N\xc4\x81bhi and Marudeva.\nHe is usually painted yellow, and has a bull as his characteristic mark. His\nstature was 500 poles in height, and he lived 8,400,000 great years. He was\nborn at Oude. When crowned king he was 2,000,000; he reigned 6,300,000 years,\nand\n\np. 490\n\nspent 100,000 in the practice of austerity, by which he became qualified for\nsainthood.\n\n23\\. Parswanatha was also of the same race as the first. He is represented as\nblue in colour, and has a snake to distinguish him. Possibly this was the real\nfounder of the Jain sect. He was born at Benares, and commenced his saintly\nlife when he was thirty years of age, and, continuing his asceticism for\nseventy years, died when he was just a hundred years old.\n\n24\\. Mahavir is the last and much the best known of all. His common title is\n"The Saint." His image is golden in colour, and his symbol a lion. He resigned\nhis position as a god in order to obtain immortality as a saint, when there\nwas a little over seventy-five years to run before the end of the age. His\nparents were Br\xc4\x81hmans; but as Indra considered it improper that one whom he\nrecognized as a saint before he was born, who was to occupy such a position,\nshould be born in a humble family, he removed the foetus to the womb of a\nprincess of the royal race, Trisala, wife of Siddh\xc4\x81rta. At twenty-eight he\nlost his father, became king and reigned for two years. Then resigning his\nroyal state, he entered upon a life of austerity, and after forty-two years of\npreparation, at the age of seventy-two he became exempt from pain for ever. In\nother words he died, and obtained moksha, deliverance from birth and death,\nabsorption. According to tradition, the death of the last Jain occurred two\nthousand four hundred years ago.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[483:*](hmvp48.htm#fr_448) Dowson, _s.v._\n\n[484:*](hmvp48.htm#fr_449) Page 41.\n\n[484:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp48.htm#fr_450) Page 150.\n\n[487:*](hmvp48.htm#fr_451) Manu, bk. iii.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Index](hmvp49.htm)\n\n'
