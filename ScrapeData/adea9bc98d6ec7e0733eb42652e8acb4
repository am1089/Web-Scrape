But of him who has become that (i.e. entered on a higher a _s_ rama)\nthere is no becoming not that (i.e. descending to a lower one), according to\n_G_ aimini also, on account of restrictive rule, absence of such like (i.e.\nstatements of descent), and non-existence (of good custom).\n\nIt has been established that there are stages of life for which chastity is\nobligatory. A doubt here arises whether one who has entered them may for some\nreason or other fall from them or not.--The purvapakshin maintains that as\nthere is no difference a person may descend to a lower stage, either from the\nwish of well performing the duties of that stage, or influenced by passion and\nthe like.--To this we reply as follows, 'Of him who has become that,' i.e. of\nhim who has reached the stages for which chastity is obligatory, there is no\n'becoming not. that,' i.e. descending thence.--Why?--'On account of\nrestrictive rule, absence of such like, and non-existence.' That means: there\nare, in the first place, restrictive rules declaring that a descent may not\ntake place. Compare 'for life mortifying the body in the house of a tutor' (\n_Kh_. Up. II, 23. 2); 'He is to go into the forest, that is he is not to\nreturn thence, that is the Upanishad;' 'Having been dismissed by the teacher\nhe is to follow one of the four a _s_ ramas, according to rule, up to release\nfrom the body.'--In the second place there are texts teaching the ascent to\nhigher a _s_ ramas ('Having completed the Brahma _k_ arya state he is to\nbecome a householder; he may wander forth from the Brahma _k_ arya state');\nbut there are none teaching the descent to lower a _s_ ramas.--And in the\nthird place there exists no good custom of that kind.--The descent to a lower\na _s_ rama can in no way be based on the wish of well performing the duties of\nthat a _s_ rama; for\n\np. 318\n\n[paragraph continues] Sm _ri_ ti says, 'One's own duty, however badly\nperformed, is better than another duty well carried out' (Bha. Gita III, 35).\nAnd the principle is that whatever is enjoined on a certain person constitutes\nhis duty, not what a person is able to perform well; for all duty is\ncharacterised by injunction. Nor is a descent allowed owing to the influence\nof passion, &c.; for restrictive rules are weightier than passion.--By the\nword 'also' the Sutrakara indicates the consensus of _G_ aimini and Badaraya\n_n_ a on this point, in order to confirm thereby the view adopted.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 41](sbe38250.htm)\n\n"
