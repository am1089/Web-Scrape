It consists of 1564\nstanzas, or something over six thousand lines of verse. The subject is that\ngreat line of kings who traced their origin to the sun, the famous "solar\nline" of Indian story. The bright particular star of the solar line is Rama,\nthe knight without fear and without reproach, the Indian ideal of a gentleman.\nHis story had been told long before Kalidasa\'s time in the _Ramayana_ , an\nepic which does not need to shun comparison with the foremost epic poems of\nEurope. In _The Dynasty of Raghu_ , too, Rama is the central figure; yet in\nKalidasa\'s poem there is much detail concerning other princes of the line. The\npoem thus naturally falls into three great parts: first, the four immediate\nancestors of Rama (cantos 1-9); second, Rama (cantos 10-15); third, certain\ndescendants of Rama (cantos 16-19). A somewhat detailed account of the matter\nof the poem may well precede criticism and comment.\n\n\n\n_First canto. The journey to the hermitage_.--The poem begins with the\ncustomary brief prayer for Shiva\'s favour:\n\nGod Shiva and his mountain bride,  \nLike word and meaning unified,  \nThe world\'s great parents, I beseech  \nTo join fit meaning to my speech.\n\n[paragraph continues] Then follow nine stanzas in which Kalidasa speaks more\ndirectly of himself than elsewhere in his works:\n\nHow great is Raghu\'s solar line!  \nHow feebly small are powers of mine!  \nAs if upon the ocean\'s swell  \nI launched a puny cockle-shell. p. 124\n\nThe fool who seeks a poet\'s fame  \nMust look for ridicule and blame,  \nLike tiptoe dwarf who fain would try  \nTo pluck the fruit for giants high.\n\nYet I may enter through the door  \nThat mightier poets pierced of yore;  \nA thread may pierce a jewel, but  \nMust follow where the diamond cut.\n\nOf kings who lived as saints from birth,  \nWho ruled to ocean-shore on earth,  \nWho toiled until success was given,  \nWhose chariots stormed the gates of heaven,\n\nWhose pious offerings were blest,  \nWho gave his wish to every guest,  \nWhose punishments were as the crimes,  \nWho woke to guard the world betimes,\n\nWho sought, that they might lavish, pelf,  \nWhose measured speech was truth itself,  \nWho fought victorious wars for fame,  \nWho loved in wives the mother\'s name,\n\nWho studied all good arts as boys,  \nWho loved, in manhood, manhood\'s joys,  \nWhose age was free from worldly care,  \nWho breathed their lives away in prayer,\n\nOf these I sing, of Raghu\'s line,  \nThough weak mine art, and wisdom mine.  \nForgive these idle stammerings  \nAnd think: For virtue\'s sake he sings.\n\nThe good who hear me will be glad  \nTo pluck the good from out the bad;  \nWhen ore is proved by fire, the loss  \nIs not of purest gold, but dross.\n\n[paragraph continues] After the briefest glance at the origin of the solar\nline, the\n\np. 125\n\npoet tells of Rama\'s great-great-grandfather, King Dilipa. The detailed\ndescription of Dilipa\'s virtues has interest as showing Kalidasa\'s ideal of an\naristocrat; a brief sample must suffice here:\n\nHe practised virtue, though in health;  \nWon riches, with no greed for wealth;  \nGuarded his life, though not from fear;  \nPrized joys of earth, but not too dear.\n\nHis virtuous foes he could esteem  \nLike bitter drugs that healing seem;  \nThe friends who sinned he could forsake  \nLike fingers bitten by a snake.\n\n[paragraph continues] Yet King Dilipa has one deep-seated grief: he has no\nson. He therefore journeys with his queen to the hermitage of the sage\nVasishtha, in order to learn what they must do to propitiate an offended fate.\nTheir chariot rolls over country roads past fragrant lotus-ponds and screaming\npeacocks and trustful deer, under archways formed without supporting pillars\nby the cranes, through villages where they receive the blessings of the\npeople. At sunset they reach the peaceful forest hermitage, and are welcomed\nby the sage. In response to Vasishtha\'s benevolent inquiries, the king\ndeclares that all goes well in the kingdom, and yet:\n\nUntil from this dear wife there springs  \nA son as great as former kings,  \nThe seven islands of the earth  \nAnd all their gems, are nothing worth.\n\nThe final debt, most holy one,  \nWhich still I owe to life--a son--  \nGalls me as galls the cutting chain  \nAn elephant housed in dirt and pain.\n\n[paragraph continues] Vasishtha tells the king that on a former occasion he\nhad offended the divine cow Fragrant, and had been cursed by the cow to lack\nchildren until he had propitiated her own offspring. While the sage is\nspeaking, Fragrant\'s daughter\n\np. 126\n\napproaches, and is entrusted to the care of the king and queen.\n\n\n\n_Second canto. The holy cow\'s gift_.--During twenty-one days the king\naccompanies the cow during her wanderings in the forest, and each night the\nqueen welcomes their return to the hermitage. On the twenty-second day the cow\nis attacked by a lion, and when the king hastens to draw an arrow, his arm is\nmagically numbed, so that he stands help- less. To increase his horror, the\nlion speaks with a human voice, saying that he is a servant of the god Shiva,\nset on guard there and eating as his appointed food any animals that may\nappear. Dilipa perceives that a struggle with earthly weapons is useless, and\nbegs the lion to accept his own body as the price of the cow\'s release. The\nlion tries sophistry, using the old, hollow arguments:\n\nGreat beauty and fresh youth are yours; on earth  \n  As sole, unrivalled emperor you rule;  \nShould you redeem a thing of little worth  \n  At such a price, you would appear a fool.\n\nIf pity moves you, think that one mere cow  \n  Would be the gainer, should you choose to die;  \nLive rather for the world! Remember how  \n  The father-king can bid all dangers fly.\n\nAnd if the fiery sage\'s wrath, aglow  \n  At loss of one sole cow, should make you shudder,  \nAppease his anger; for you can bestow  \n  Cows by the million, each with pot-like udder.\n\nSave life and youth; for to the dead are given  \n  No long, unbroken years of joyous mirth;  \nBut riches and imperial power are heaven--  \n  The gods have nothing that you lack on earth.\n\nThe lion spoke and ceased; but echo rolled  \n  Forth from the caves wherein the sound was pent,  \nAs if the hills applauded manifold,  \n  Repeating once again the argument.\n\np. 127\n\n[paragraph continues] Dilipa has no trouble in piercing this sophistical\nargument, and again offers his own life, begging the lion to spare the body of\nhis fame rather than the body of his flesh. The lion consents, but when the\nking resolutely presents himself to be eaten, the illusion vanishes, and the\nholy cow grants the king his desire. The king returns to his capital with the\nqueen, who shortly becomes pregnant.\n\n\n\n_Third canto. Raghu\'s consecration_.--The queen gives birth to a glorious boy,\nwhom the joyful father names Raghu. There follows a description of the happy\nfamily, of which a few stanzas are given here:\n\nThe king drank pleasure from him late and soon  \n  With eyes that stared like windless lotus-flowers;  \n  Unselfish joy expanded all his powers  \nAs swells the sea responsive to the moon.\n\nThe rooted love that filled each parent\'s soul  \n  For the other, deep as bird\'s love for the mate,  \n  Was now divided with the boy; and straight  \nThe remaining half proved greater than the whole.\n\nHe learned the reverence that befits a boy;  \n  Following the nurse\'s words, began to talk;  \n  And clinging to her finger, learned to walk:  \nThese childish lessons stretched his father\'s joy,\n\nWho clasped the baby to his breast, and thrilled  \n  To feel the nectar-touch upon his skin,  \n  Half closed his eyes, the father\'s bliss to win  \nWhich, more for long delay, his being filled.\n\nThe baby hair must needs be clipped; yet he  \n  Retained two dangling locks, his cheeks to fret;  \n  And down the river of the alphabet  \nHe swam, with other boys, to learning\'s sea.\n\nReligion\'s rites, and what good learning suits  \n  A prince, he had from teachers old and wise;  \n  Not theirs the pain of barren enterprise,  \nFor effort spent on good material, fruits.\n\np. 128\n\n[paragraph continues] This happy childhood is followed by a youth equally\nhappy. Raghu is married and made crown prince. He is entrusted with the care\nof the horse of sacrifice, 1 and when Indra, king of the gods, steals the\nhorse, Raghu fights him. He cannot overcome the king of heaven, yet he acquits\nhimself so creditably that he wins Indra\'s friendship. In consequence of this\nproof of his manhood, the empire is bestowed upon Raghu by his father, who\nretires with his queen to the forest, to spend his last days and prepare for\ndeath.\n\n\n\n_Fourth canto. Raghu conquers the world_.--The canto opens with several\nstanzas descriptive of the glory of youthful King Raghu.\n\nHe manifested royal worth  \nBy even justice toward the earth,  \nBeloved as is the southern breeze,  \nToo cool to burn, too warm to freeze.\n\nThe people loved his father, yet  \nFor greater virtues could forget;  \nThe beauty of the blossoms fair  \nIs lost when mango-fruits are there.\n\n[paragraph continues] But the vassal kings are restless\n\nFor when they knew the king was gone  \nAnd power was wielded by his son,  \nThe wrath of subject kings awoke,  \nWhich had been damped in sullen smoke.\n\nRaghu therefore determines to make a warlike progress through all India. He\nmarches eastward with his army from his capital Ayodhya (the name is preserved\nin the modern\n\np. 129\n\n[paragraph continues] Oudh) to the Bay of Bengal, then south along the eastern\nshore of India to Cape Comorin, then north along the western shore until he\ncomes to the region drained by the Indus, finally east through the tremendous\nHimalaya range into Assam, and thence home. The various nations whom he\nencounters, Hindus, Persians, Greeks, and White Huns, all submit either with\nor without fighting. On his safe return, Raghu offers a great sacrifice and\ngives away all his wealth. 1\n\n\n\n_Fifth canto. Aja goes wooing_.--While King Raghu is penniless, a young sage\ncomes to him, desiring a huge sum of money to give to the teacher with whom he\nhas just finished his education. The king, unwilling that any suppliant should\ngo away unsatisfied, prepares to assail the god of wealth in his Himalayan\nstronghold, and the god, rather than risk the combat, sends a rain of gold\ninto the king\'s treasury. This gold King Raghu bestows upon the sage, who\ngratefully uses his spiritual power to cause a son to be born to his\nbenefactor. In course of time, the son is born and the name Aja is given to\nhim. We are here introduced to Prince Aja, who is a kind of secondary hero in\nthe poem, inferior only to his mighty grandson, Rama. To Aja are devoted the\nremainder of this fifth canto and the following three cantos; and these Aja-\ncantos are among the loveliest in the epic. When the prince has grown into\nyoung manhood, he journeys to a neighbouring court to participate in the\nmarriage reception of Princess Indumati. 2 One evening he camps by a river,\nfrom which a wild elephant issues and attacks his party. When wounded by Aja,\nthe elephant strangely changes his form, becoming a demigod, gives the prince\na magic weapon, and departs to heaven. Aja proceeds\n\np. 130\n\nwithout further adventure to the country and the palace of Princess Indumati,\nwhere he is made welcome and luxuriously lodged for the night. In the morning,\nhe is awakened by the song of the court poets outside his chamber. He rises\nand betakes himself to the hall where the suitors are gathering.\n\n\n\n_Sixth canto. The princess chooses_.--The princely suitors assemble in the\nhall; then, to the sound of music, the princess enters in a litter, robed as a\nbride, and creates a profound sensation.\n\nFor when they saw God\'s masterpiece, the maid  \n  Who smote their eyes to other objects blind,  \nTheir glances, wishes, hearts, in homage paid,  \n  Flew forth to her; mere flesh remained behind.\n\nThe princes could not but betray their yearning  \n  By sending messengers, their love to bring,  \nIn many a quick, involuntary turning,  \n  As flowering twigs of trees announce the spring.\n\n[paragraph continues] Then a maid-servant conducts the princess from one\nsuitor to another, and explains the claim which each has upon her affection.\nFirst is presented the King of Magadha, recommended in four stanzas, one of\nwhich runs:\n\nThough other kings by thousands numbered be,  \nHe seems the one, sole governor of earth;  \nStars, constellations, planets, fade and flee  \nWhen to the moon the night has given birth,\n\n[paragraph continues] But the princess is not attracted.\n\nThe slender maiden glanced at him; she glanced  \n  And uttered not a word, nor heeded how  \nThe grass-twined blossoms of her garland danced  \n  When she dismissed him with a formal bow.\n\n[paragraph continues] They pass to the next candidate, the king of the Anga\ncountry, in whose behalf this, and more, is said:\n\np. 131\n\nLearning and wealth by nature are at strife,  \n  Yet dwell at peace in him; and for the two  \nYou would be fit companion as his wife,  \n  Like wealth enticing, and like learning true.\n\n[paragraph continues] Him too the princess rejects, "not that he was unworthy\nof love, or she lacking in discernment, but tastes differ." She is then\nconducted to the King of Avanti:\n\nAnd if this youthful prince your fancy pleases,  \n  Bewitching maiden, you and he may play  \nIn those unmeasured gardens that the breezes  \n  From Sipra\'s billows ruffle, cool with spray.\n\n[paragraph continues] The inducement is insufficient, and a new candidate is\npresented, the King of Anupa,\n\nA prince whose fathers\' glories cannot fade,  \n  By whom the love of learned men is wooed,  \nWho proves that Fortune is no fickle jade  \n  When he she chooses is not fickly good.\n\n[paragraph continues] But alas!\n\nShe saw that he was brave to look upon,  \n  Yet could not feel his love would make her gay;  \nFull moons of autumn nights, when clouds are gone,  \n  Tempt not the lotus-flowers that bloom by day.\n\n[paragraph continues] The King of Shurasena has no better fortune, in spite of\nhis virtues and his wealth. As a river hurrying to the sea passes by a\nmountain that would detain her, so the princess passes him by. She is next\nintroduced to the king of the Kalinga country;\n\nHis palace overlooks the ocean dark  \n  With windows gazing on the unresting deep,  \nWhose gentle thunders drown the drums that mark  \n  The hours of night, and wake him from his sleep.\n\n[paragraph continues] But the maiden can no more feel at home with him than\nthe\n\np. 132\n\ngoddess of fortune can with a good but unlucky man. She therefore turns her\nattention to the king of the Pandya country in far southern India. But she is\nunmoved by hearing of the magic charm of the south, and rejects him too.\n\nAnd every prince rejected while she sought  \n  A husband, darkly frowned, as turrets, bright  \nOne moment with the flame from torches caught,  \n  Frown gloomily again and sink in night.\n\n[paragraph continues] The princess then approaches Aja, who trembles lest she\npass him by, as she has passed by the other suitors. The maid who accompanies\nIndumati sees that Aja awakens a deeper feeling, and she therefore gives a\nlonger account of his kingly line, ending with the recommendation:\n\nHigh lineage is his, fresh beauty, youth,  \n  And virtue shaped in kingly breeding\'s mould;  \nChoose him, for he is worth your love; in truth,  \n  A gem is ever fitly set in gold.\n\nThe princess looks lovingly at the handsome youth, but cannot speak for\nmodesty. She is made to understand her own feelings when the maid invites her\nto pass on to the next candidate. Then the wreath is placed round Aja\'s neck,\nthe people of the city shout their approval, and the disappointed suitors feel\nlike night-blooming lotuses at daybreak.\n\n\n\n_Seventh canto. Aja\'s marriage_.--While the suitors retire to the camps where\nthey have left their retainers, Aja conducts Indumati into the decorated and\nfestive city. The windows are filled with the faces of eager and excited\nwomen, who admire the beauty of the young prince and the wisdom of the\nprincess\'s choice. When the marriage ceremony has been happily celebrated, the\ndisappointed suitors say farewell  with pleasant faces and jealous hearts,\nlike peaceful pools concealing crocodiles. They lie in ambush on the road\nwhich he must take, and when he passes with his young bride, they fall upon\nhim. Aja provides for the safety of Indumati, marshals his attendants, and\ngreatly distinguishes himself in the battle which follows. Finally he uses the\nmagic weapon,\n\np. 133\n\ngiven him by the demigod, to benumb his adversaries, and leaving them in this\nhelpless condition, returns home. He and his young bride are joyfully welcomed\nby King Raghu, who resigns the kingdom in favour of Aja.\n\n\n\n_Eighth canto. Aja\'s lament_.--As soon as King Aja is firmly established on\nhis throne, Raghu retires to a hermitage to prepare for the death of his\nmortal part. After some years of religious meditation he is released,\nattaining union with the eternal spirit which is beyond all darkness. His\nobsequies are performed by his dutiful son. Indumati gives birth to a splendid\nboy, who is named Dasharatha. One day, as the queen is playing with her\nhusband in the garden, a wreath of magic flowers falls upon her from heaven,\nand she dies. The stricken king clasps the body of his dead beloved, and\nlaments over her.\n\nIf flowers that hardly touch the body, slay it,  \n  The simplest instruments of fate may bring  \nDestruction, and we have no power to stay it;  \n  Then must we live in fear of everything?\n\nNo! Death was right. He spared the sterner anguish;  \n  Through gentle flowers your gentle life was lost  \nAs I have seen the lotus fade and languish  \n  When smitten by the slow and silent frost.\n\nYet God is hard. With unforgiving rigour  \n  He forged a bolt to crush this heart of mine;  \nHe left the sturdy tree its living vigour,  \n  But stripped away and slew the clinging vine.\n\nThrough all the years, dear, you would not reprove me,  \n  Though I offended. Can you go away  \nSudden, without a word? I know you love me,  \n  And I have not offended you to-day.\n\nYou surely thought me faithless, to be banished  \n  As light-of-love and gambler, from your life,  \nBecause without a farewell word, you vanished  \n  And never will return, sweet-smiling wife.\n\nThe warmth and blush that followed after kisses  \n  Is still upon her face, to madden me;  \nFor life is gone, \'tis only life she misses.  \n  A curse upon such life\'s uncertainty!\n\nI never wronged you with a thought unspoken,  \n  Still less with actions. Whither are you flown?  \nThough king in name, I am a man heartbroken,  \n  For power and love took root in you alone.\n\nYour bee-black hair from which the flowers are peeping,  \n  Dear, wavy hair that I have loved so well,  \nStirs in the wind until I think you sleeping,  \n  Soon to return and make my glad heart swell.\n\nAwake, my love! Let only life be given,  \n  And choking griefs that stifle now, will flee  \nAs darkness from the mountain-cave is driven  \n  By magic herbs that glitter brilliantly.\n\nThe silent face, round which the curls are keeping  \n  Their scattered watch, is sad to look upon  \nAs in the night some lonely lily, sleeping  \n  When musically humming bees are gone.\n\nThe girdle that from girlhood has befriended  \n  You, in love-secrets wise, discreet, and true,  \nNo longer tinkles, now your dance is ended,  \n  Faithful in life, in dying faithful too.\n\nYour low, sweet voice to nightingales was given;  \n  Your idly graceful movement to the swans;  \nYour grace to fluttering vines, dear wife in heaven;  \n  Your trustful, wide-eyed glances to the fawns:\n\nYou left your charms on earth, that I, reminded  \n  By them, might be consoled though you depart;  \nBut vainly! Far from you, by sorrow blinded,  \n  I find no prop of comfort for my heart.\n\nRemember how you planned to make a wedding,  \n  Giving the vine-bride to her mango-tree; p. 135  \nBefore that happy day, dear, you are treading  \n  The path with no return. It should not be.\n\nAnd this ashoka-tree that you have tended  \n  With eager longing for the blossoms red  \nHow can I twine the flowers that should have blended  \n  With living curls, in garlands for the dead?\n\nThe tree remembers how the anklets, tinkling  \n  On graceful feet, delighted other years;  \nSad now he droops, your form with sorrow sprinkling,  \n  And sheds his blossoms in a rain of tears.\n\nJoy\'s sun is down, all love is fallen and perished,  \n  The song of life is sung, the spring is dead,  \nGone is the use of gems that once you cherished,  \n  And empty, ever empty, is my bed.\n\nYou were my comrade gay, my home, my treasure,  \n  You were my bosom\'s friend, in all things true,  \nMy best-loved pupil in the arts of pleasure:  \n  Stern death took all I had in taking you.\n\nStill am I king, and rich in kingly fashion,  \nYet lacking you, am poor the long years through;  \nI cannot now be won to any passion,  \nFor all my passions centred, dear, in you.\n\n[paragraph continues] Aja commits the body of his beloved queen to the flames.\nA holy hermit comes to tell the king that his wife had been a nymph of heaven\nin a former existence, and that she has now returned to her home. But Aja\ncannot be comforted. He lives eight weary years for the sake of his young son,\nthen is reunited with his queen in Paradise.\n\n\n\n_Ninth canto. The hunt_.--This canto introduces us to King Dasharatha, father\nof the heroic Rama. It begins with an elaborate description of his glory,\njustice, prowess, and piety; then tells of the three princesses who became his\nwives: Kausalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. In the beautiful springtime he takes an\nextended hunting-trip in the forest, during which an accident happens, big\nwith fate.\n\np. 136\n\nHe left his soldiers far behind one day  \nIn the wood, and following where deer-tracks lay,  \nCame with his weary horse adrip with foam  \nTo river-banks where hermits made their home.\n\nAnd in the stream he heard the water fill  \nA jar; he heard it ripple clear and shrill,  \nAnd shot an arrow, thinking he had found  \nA trumpeting elephant, toward the gurgling sound\n\nSuch actions are forbidden to a king,  \nYet Dasharatha sinned and did this thing;  \nFor even the wise and learned man is minded  \nTo go astray, by selfish passion blinded.\n\nHe heard the startling cry, "My father!" rise  \nAmong the reeds; rode up; before his eyes  \nHe saw the jar, the wounded hermit boy:  \nRemorse transfixed his heart and killed his joy.\n\nHe left his horse, this monarch famous far,  \nAsked him who drooped upon the water-jar  \nHis name, and from the stumbling accents knew  \nA hermit youth, of lowly birth but true.\n\nThe arrow still undrawn, the monarch bore  \nHim to his parents who, afflicted sore  \nWith blindness, could not see their only son  \nDying, and told them what his hand had done.\n\nThe murderer then obeyed their sad behest  \nAnd drew the fixed arrow from his breast;  \nThe boy lay dead; the father cursed the king,  \nWith tear-stained hands, to equal suffering.\n\n"In sorrow for your son you too shall die,  \nAn old, old man," he said, "as sad as I."  \nPoor, trodden snake! He used his venomous sting,  \nThen heard the answer of the guilty king:\n\n"Your curse is half a blessing if I see  \nThe longed-for son who shall be born to me: p. 137  \nThe scorching fire that sweeps the well-ploughed field,  \nMay burn indeed, but stimulates the yield.\n\nThe deed is done; what kindly act can I  \nPerform who, pitiless, deserve to die?"  \n"Bring wood," he begged, "and build a funeral pyre,  \nThat we may seek our son through death by fire."\n\nThe king fulfilled their wish; and while they burned,  \nIn mute, sin-stricken sorrow he returned,  \nHiding death\'s seed within him, as the sea  \nHides magic fire that burns eternally.\n\n[paragraph continues] Thus is foreshadowed the birth of Rama, his banishment,\nand the death of his father.\n\nCantos ten to fifteen form the kernel of the epic, for they tell the story of\nRama, the mighty hero of Raghu\'s line. In these cantos Kalidasa attempts to\npresent anew, with all the literary devices of a more sophisticated age, the\nfamous old epic story sung in masterly fashion by the author of the\n_Ramayana_. As the poet is treading ground familiar to all who hear him, the\naction of these cantos is very compressed.\n\n\n\n_Tenth canto. The incarnation of Rama_.--While Dasharatha, desiring a son, is\nchildless, the gods, oppressed by a giant adversary, betake themselves to\nVishnu, seeking aid. They sing a hymn of praise, a part of which is given\nhere.\n\nO thou who didst create this All,  \nWho dost preserve it, lest it fall,  \nWho wilt destroy it and its ways--  \nTo thee, O triune Lord, be praise.\n\nAs into heaven\'s water run  \nThe tastes of earth--yet it is one,  \nSo thou art all the things that range  \nThe universe, yet dost not change.\n\nFar, far removed, yet ever near;  \nUntouched by passion, yet austere; p. 138  \nSinless, yet pitiful of heart;  \nAncient, yet free from age--Thou art.\n\nThough uncreate, thou seekest birth;  \nDreaming, thou watchest heaven and earth;  \nPassionless, smitest low thy foes;  \nWho knows thy nature, Lord? Who knows?\n\nThough many different paths, O Lord,  \nMay lead us to some great reward,  \nThey gather and are merged in thee  \nLike floods of Ganges in the sea.\n\nThe saints who give thee every thought,  \nWhose every act for thee is wrought,  \nYearn for thine everlasting peace,  \nFor bliss with thee, that cannot cease.\n\nLike pearls that grow in ocean\'s night,  \nLike sunbeams radiantly bright,  \nThy strange and wonder-working ways  \nDefeat extravagance of praise.\n\nIf songs that to thy glory tend  \nShould weary grow or take an end,  \nOur impotence must bear the blame,  \nAnd not thine unexhausted name.\n\n[paragraph continues] Vishnu is gratified by the praise of the gods, and asks\ntheir desire. They inform him that they are distressed by Ravana, the giant\nking of Lanka (Ceylon), whom they cannot conquer. Vishnu promises to aid them\nby descending to earth in a new avatar, as son of Dasharatha. Shortly\nafterwards, an angel appears before King Dasharatha, bringing in a golden bowl\na substance which contains the essence of Vishnu. The king gives it to his\nthree wives, who thereupon conceive and dream wonderful dreams. Then Queen\nKausalya gives birth to Rama; Queen Kaikeyi to Bharata; Queen Sumitra to\ntwins, Lakshmana and Shatrughna. Heaven and earth rejoice. The four princes\ngrow up in mutual friendship, yet Rama and Lakshmana are peculiarly drawn to\neach\n\np. 139\n\nother, as are Bharata and Shatrughna. So beautiful and so modest are the four\nboys that they seem like incarnations of the four things worth living for--\nvirtue, money, love, and salvation.\n\n\n\n_Eleventh canto. The victory over Rama-with-the-axe_.--At the request of the\nholy hermit Vishvamitra, the two youths Rama and Lakshmana visit his\nhermitage, to protect it from evil spirits. The two lads little suspect, on\ntheir maiden journey, how much of their lives will be spent in wandering\ntogether in the forest. On the way they are attacked by a giantess, whom Rama\nkills; the first of many giants who are to fall at his hand. He is given magic\nweapons by the hermit, with which he and his brother kill other giants,\nfreeing the hermitage from all annoyance. The two brothers then travel with\nthe hermit to the city of Mithila, attracted thither by hearing of its king,\nhis wonderful daughter, and his wonderful bow. The bow was given him by the\ngod Shiva; no man has been able to bend it; and the beautiful princess\'s hand\nis the prize of any man who can perform the feat. On the way thither, Rama\nbrings to life Ahalya, a woman who in a former age had been changed to stone\nfor unfaithfulness to her austere husband, and had been condemned to remain a\nstone until trodden by Rama\'s foot. Without further adventure, they reach\nMithila, where the hermit presents Rama as a candidate for the bending of the\nbow.\n\nThe king beheld the boy, with beauty blest  \n  And famous lineage; he sadly thought  \nHow hard it was to bend the bow, distressed  \n  Because his child must be so dearly bought.\n\nHe said: "O holy one, a mighty deed  \n  That full-grown elephants with greatest pain  \nCould hardly be successful in, we need  \n  Not ask of elephant-cubs. It would be vain.\n\nFor many splendid kings of valorous name,  \n  Bearing the scars of many a hard-fought day,  \nHave tried and failed; then, covered with their shame,  \n  Have shrugged their shoulders, cursed, and strode away."\n\np. 140\n\n[paragraph continues] Yet when the bow is given to the youthful Rama, he not\nonly bends, but breaks it. He is immediately rewarded with the hand of the\nPrincess Sita, while Lakshmana marries her sister. On their journey home with\ntheir young brides, dreadful portents appear, followed by their cause, a\nstrange being called Rama-with-the-axe, who is carefully to be distinguished\nfrom Prince Rama. This Rama-with-the-axe is a Brahman who has sworn to\nexterminate the entire warrior caste, and who naturally attacks the valorous\nprince. He makes light of Rama\'s achievement in breaking Shiva\'s bow, and\nchallenges him to bend the mightier bow which he carries. This the prince\nsucceeds in doing, and Rama-with-the-axe disappears, shamed and defeated. The\nmarriage party then continues its journey to Ayodhya.\n\n\n\n_Twelfth canto. The killing of Ravana_.--King Dasharatha prepares to anoint\nRama crown prince, when Queen Kaikeyi interposes. On an earlier occasion she\nhad rendered the king a service and received his promise that he would grant\nher two boons, whatever she desired. She now demands her two boons: the\nbanishment of Rama for fourteen years, and the anointing of her own son\nBharata as crown prince. Rama thereupon sets out for the Dandaka forest in\nSouthern India, accompanied by his faithful wife Sita and his devoted brother\nLakshmana. The stricken father dies of grief, thus fulfilling the hermit\'s\ncurse. Now Prince Bharata proves himself more generous than his mother; he\nrefuses the kingdom, and is with great difficulty persuaded by Rama himself to\nact as regent during the fourteen years. Even so, he refuses to enter the\ncapital city, dwelling in a village outside the walls, and preserving Rama\'s\nslippers as a symbol of the rightful king. Meanwhile Rama\'s little party\npenetrates the wild forests of the south, fighting as need arises with the\ngiants there. Unfortunately, a giantess falls in love with Rama, and\n\nIn Sita\'s very presence told  \nHer birth--love made her overbold:  \nFor mighty passion, as a rule,  \nWill change a woman to a fool.\n\np. 141\n\n[paragraph continues] Scorned by Rama, laughed at by Sita, she becomes furious\nand threatening.\n\nLaugh on! Your laughter\'s fruit shall be  \nCommended to you. Gaze on me!  \nI am a tigress, you shall know,  \nInsulted by a feeble doe.\n\n[paragraph continues] Lakshmana thereupon cuts off her nose and ears,\nrendering her redundantly hideous. She departs, to return presently at the\nhead of an army of giants, whom Rama defeats single-handed, while his brother\nguards Sita. The giantess then betakes herself to her brother, the terrible\nten-headed Ravana, king of Ceylon. He succeeds in capturing Sita by a trick,\nand carries her off to his fortress in Ceylon. It is plainly necessary for\nRama to seek allies before attempting to cross the straits and attack the\nstronghold. He therefore renders an important service to the monkey king\nSugriva, who gratefully leads an army of monkeys to his assistance. The most\nvaliant of these, Hanumat, succeeds in entering Ravana\'s capital, where he\nfinds Sita, gives her a token from Rama, and receives a token for Rama. The\narmy thereupon sets out and comes to the seashore, where it is reinforced by\nthe giant Vibhishana, who has deserted his wicked brother Ravana. The monkeys\nhurl great boulders into the strait, thus forming a bridge over which they\ncross into Ceylon and besiege Ravana\'s capital. There ensue many battles\nbetween the giants and the monkeys, culminating in a tremendous duel between\nthe champions, Rama and Ravana. In this duel Ravana is finally slain. Rama\nrecovers his wife, and the principal personages of the army enter the flying\nchariot which had belonged to Ravana, to return to Ayodhya; for the fourteen\nyears of exile are now over.\n\n\n\n_Thirteenth canto. The return from the forest_.--This canto describes the long\njourney through the air from Ceylon over the whole length of India to Ayodhya.\nAs the celestial car makes its journey, Rama points out the objects of\ninterest or of memory to Sita. Thus, as they fly over the sea:\n\nThe form of ocean, infinitely changing,  \n  Clasping the world and all its gorgeous state, p. 142  \nUnfathomed by the intellect\'s wide ranging,  \n  Is awful like the form of God, and great.\n\nHe gives his billowy lips to many a river  \n  That into his embrace with passion slips,  \nLover of many wives, a generous giver  \n  Of kisses, yet demanding eager lips.\n\nLook back, my darling, with your fawn-like glances  \n  Upon the path that from your prison leads;  \nSee how the sight of land again entrances,  \n  How fair the forest, as the sea recedes.\n\n[paragraph continues] Then, as they pass over the spot where Rama searched for\nhis stolen wife:\n\nThere is the spot where, sorrowfully searching,  \n  I found an anklet on the ground one day;  \nIt could not tinkle, for it was not perching  \n  On your dear foot, but sad and silent lay.\n\nI learned where you were carried by the giant  \n  From vines that showed themselves compassionate;  \nThey could not utter words, yet with their pliant  \n  Branches they pointed where you passed of late.\n\nThe deer were kind; for while the juicy grasses  \n  Fell quite unheeded from each careless mouth,  \nThey turned wide eyes that said, "\'Tis there she passes  \n  The hours as weary captive" toward the south.\n\nThere is the mountain where the peacocks\' screaming,  \n  And branches smitten fragrant by the rain,  \nAnd madder-flowers that woke at last from dreaming,  \n  Made unendurable my lonely pain;\n\nAnd mountain-caves where I could scarce dissemble  \n  The woe I felt when thunder crashed anew,  \nFor I remembered how you used to tremble  \n  At thunder, seeking arms that longed for you.\n\np. 143\n\n[paragraph continues] Rama then points out the spots in Southern India where\nhe and Sita had dwelt in exile, and the pious hermitages which they had\nvisited; later, the holy spot where the Jumna River joins the Ganges; finally,\ntheir distant home, unseen for fourteen years, and the well-known river, from\nwhich spray-laden breezes come to them like cool, welcoming hands. When they\ndraw near, Prince Bharata comes forth to welcome them, and the happy\nprocession approaches the capital city.\n\n\n\n_Fourteenth canto. Sita is put away_.--The exiles are welcomed by Queen\nKausalya and Queen Sumitra with a joy tinged with deep melancholy. After the\nlong-deferred anointing of Rama as king, comes the triumphal entry into the\nancestral capital, where Rama begins his virtuous reign with his beloved queen\nmost happily; for the very hardships endured in the forest turn into pleasures\nwhen remembered in the palace. To crown the king\'s joy, Sita becomes pregnant,\nand expresses a wish to visit the forest again. At this point, where an\nordinary story would end, comes the great tragedy, the tremendous test of\nRama\'s character. The people begin to murmur about the queen, believing that\nshe could not have preserved her purity in the giant\'s palace. Rama knows that\nshe is innocent, but he also knows that he cannot be a good king while the\npeople feel as they do; and after a pitiful struggle, he decides to put away\nhis beloved wife. He bids his brother Lakshmana take her to the forest, in\naccordance with her request, but to leave her there at the hermitage of the\nsage Valmiki. When this is done, and Sita hears the terrible future from\nLakshmana, she cries:\n\nTake reverent greeting to the queens, my mothers,  \n  And say to each with honour due her worth:  \n"My child is your son\'s child, and not another\'s;  \n  Oh, pray for him, before he comes to birth."\n\nAnd tell the king from me: "You saw the matter,  \n  How I was guiltless proved in fire divine;  \nWill you desert me for mere idle chatter?  \n  Are such things done in Raghu\'s royal line? p. 144\n\nAh no! I cannot think you fickle-minded,  \n  For you were always very kind to me;  \nFate\'s thunderclap by which my eyes are blinded  \n  Rewards my old, forgotten sins, I see.\n\nOh, I could curse my life and quickly end it,  \n  For it is useless, lived from you apart,  \nBut that I bear within, and must defend it,  \n  Your life, your child and mine, beneath my heart.\n\nWhen he is born, I\'ll scorn my queenly station,  \n  Gaze on the sun, and live a hell on earth,  \nThat I may know no pain of separation  \n  From you, my husband, in another birth,\n\nMy king! Eternal duty bids you never  \n  Forget a hermit who for sorrow faints;  \nThough I am exiled from your bed for ever,  \n  I claim the care you owe to all the saints."\n\n[paragraph continues] So she accepts her fate with meek courage. But\n\nWhen Rama\'s brother left her there to languish  \n  And bore to them she loved her final word,  \nShe loosed her throat in an excess of anguish  \n  And screamed as madly as a frightened bird.\n\nTrees shed their flowers, the peacock-dances ended,  \n  The grasses dropped from mouths of feeding deer,  \nAs if the universal forest blended  \n  Its tears with hers, and shared her woeful fear.\n\nWhile she laments thus piteously, she is discovered by the poet-sage Valmiki,\nwho consoles her with tender and beautiful words, and conducts her to his\nhermitage, where she awaits the time of her confinement. Meanwhile Rama leads\na dreary life, finding duty but a cold comforter. He makes a golden statue of\nhis wife, and will not look at other women.\n\n\n\n_Fifteenth canto. Rama goes to heaven_.--The canto opens with a rather long\ndescription of a fight between Rama\'s youngest brother and a giant. On the\njourney to meet the\n\np. 145\n\ngiant, Shatrughna spends a night in Valmiki\'s hermitage, and that very night\nSita gives birth to twin sons. Valmiki gives them the names Kusha and Lava,\nand when they grow out of childhood he teaches them his own composition, the\nRamayana, "the sweet story of Rama," "the first path shown to poets." At this\ntime the young son of a Brahman dies in the capital, and the father laments at\nthe king\'s gate, for he believes that the king is unworthy, else heaven would\nnot send death prematurely. Rama is roused to stamp out evil-doing in the\nkingdom, whereupon the dead boy comes to life. The king then feels that his\ntask on earth is nearly done, and prepares to celebrate the great horse-\nsacrifice. 1 At this sacrifice appear the two youths Kusha and Lava, who sing\nthe epic of Rama\'s deeds in the presence of Rama himself. The father perceives\ntheir likeness to himself, then learns that they are indeed his children, whom\nhe has never seen. Thereupon Sita is brought forward by the poet-sage Valmiki\nand in the presence of her husband and her detractors establishes her constant\npurity in a terrible fashion.\n\n"If I am faithful to my lord  \nIn thought, in action, and in word,  \nI pray that Earth who bears us all  \nMay bid me in her bosom fall."\n\nThe faithful wife no sooner spoke  \nThan earth divided, and there broke  \nFrom deep within a flashing light  \nThat flamed like lightning, blinding-bright.\n\nAnd, seated on a splendid throne  \nUpheld by serpents\' hoods alone,  \nThe goddess Earth rose visibly,  \nAnd she was girded with the sea.\n\nSita was clasped in her embrace,  \nWhile still she gazed on Rama\'s face:  \nHe cried aloud in wild despair;  \nShe sank, and left him standing there.\n\n[paragraph continues] Rama then establishes his brothers, sons, and nephews in\n\np. 146\n\ndifferent cities of the kingdom, buries the three queens of his father, and\nawaits death. He has not long to wait; Death comes, wearing a hermit\'s garb,\nasks for a private interview, and threatens any who shall disturb their\nconference. Lakshmana disturbs them, and so dies before Rama. Then Rama is\ntranslated.\n\nCantos sixteen to nineteen form the third division of the epic, and treat of\nRama\'s descendants. The interest wanes, for the great hero is gone.\n\n\n\n_Sixteenth canto. Kumudvati\'s wedding_.--As Kusha lies awake one night, a\nfemale figure appears in his chamber; and in answer to his question, declares\nthat she is the presiding goddess of the ancient capital Ayodhya, which has\nbeen deserted since Rama\'s departure to heaven. She pictures the sad state of\nthe city thus:\n\nI have no king; my towers and terraces  \n  Crumble and fall; my walls are overthrown;  \nAs when the ugly winds of evening seize  \n  The rack of clouds in helpless darkness blown.\n\nIn streets where maidens gaily passed at night,  \n  Where once was known the tinkle and the shine  \nOf anklets, jackals slink, and by the light  \n  Of flashing fangs, seek carrion, snarl, and whine.\n\nThe water of the pools that used to splash  \n  With drumlike music, under maidens\' hands,  \nGroans now when bisons from the jungle lash  \n  It with their clumsy horns, and roil its sands.\n\nThe peacock-pets are wild that once were tame;  \n  They roost on trees, not perches; lose desire  \nFor dancing to the drums; and feel no shame  \n  For fans singed close by sparks of forest-fire.\n\nOn stairways where the women once were glad  \n  To leave their pink and graceful footprints, here  \nUnwelcome, blood-stained paws of tigers pad,  \n  Fresh-smeared from slaughter of the forest deer. p. 147\n\nWall-painted elephants in lotus-brooks,  \n  Receiving each a lily from his mate,  \nAre torn and gashed, as if by cruel hooks,  \n  By claws of lions, showing furious hate.\n\nI see my pillared caryatides  \n  Neglected, weathered, stained by passing time,  \nWearing in place of garments that should please,  \n  The skins of sloughing cobras, foul with slime.\n\nThe balconies grow black with long neglect,  \n  And grass-blades sprout through floors no longer tight;  \nThey still receive but cannot now reflect  \n  The old, familiar moonbeams, pearly white.\n\nThe vines that blossomed in my garden bowers,  \n  That used to show their graceful beauty, when  \nGirls gently bent their twigs and plucked their flowers,  \n  Are broken by wild apes and wilder men.\n\nThe windows are not lit by lamps at night,  \n  Nor by fair faces shining in the day,  \nBut webs of spiders dim the delicate, light  \n  Smoke-tracery with one mere daub of grey.\n\nThe river is deserted; on the shore  \n  No gaily bathing men and maidens leave  \nFood for the swans; its reedy bowers no more  \n  Are vocal: seeing this, I can but grieve.\n\n[paragraph continues] The goddess therefore begs Kusha to return with his\ncourt to the old capital, and when he assents, she smiles and vanishes. The\nnext morning Kusha announces the vision of the night, and immediately sets out\nfor Ayodhya with his whole army. Arrived there, King Kusha quickly restores\nthe city to its former splendour. Then when the hot summer comes, the king\ngoes down to the river to bathe with the ladies of the court. While in the\nwater he loses a great gem which his father had given him. The divers are\nunable to find it, and declare their belief that it has been stolen by the\nserpent Kumuda who lives in the river. The king\n\np. 148\n\nthreatens to shoot an arrow into the river, whereupon the waters divide, and\nthe serpent appears with the gem. He is accompanied by a beautiful maiden,\nwhom he introduces as his sister Kumudvati, and whom he offers in marriage to\nKusha. The offer is accepted, and the wedding celebrated with great pomp.\n\n\n\n_Seventeenth canto. King Atithi_.--To the king and queen is born a son, who is\nnamed Atithi. When he has grown into manhood, his father Kusha engages in a\nstruggle with a demon, in which the king is killed in the act of killing his\nadversary. He goes to heaven, followed by his faithful queen, and Atithi is\nanointed king. The remainder of the canto describes King Atithi\'s glorious\nreign.\n\n\n\n_Eighteenth canto. The later princes_.--This canto gives a brief,\nimpressionistic sketch of the twenty-one kings who in their order succeeded\nAtithi.\n\n\n\n_Nineteenth canto. The loves of Agnivarna_.--After the twenty-one kings just\nmentioned, there succeeds a king named Agnivarna, who gives himself to\ndissipation. He shuts himself up in the palace; even when duty requires him to\nappear before his subjects, he does so merely by hanging one foot out of a\nwindow. He trains dancing-girls himself, and has so many mistresses that he\ncannot always call them by their right names. It is not wonderful that this\nkind of life leads before long to a consuming disease; and as Agnivarna is\neven then unable to resist the pleasures of the senses, he dies. His queen is\npregnant, and she mounts the throne as regent in behalf of her unborn son.\nWith this strange scene, half tragic, half vulgar, the epic, in the form in\nwhich it has come down to us, abruptly ends.\n\nIf we now endeavour to form some critical estimate of the poem, we are met at\nthe outset by this strangely unnatural termination. We cannot avoid wondering\nwhether the poem as we have it is complete. And we shall find that there are\ngood reasons for believing that Kalidasa did not let the glorious solar line\nend in the person of the voluptuous Agnivarna and his unborn child. In the\nfirst place, there is a constant tradition which affirms that _The Dynasty of\nRaghu_  \n\np. 149\n\noriginally consisted of twenty-five cantos. A similar tradition concerning\nKalidasa\'s second epic has justified itself; for some time only seven cantos\nwere known; then more were discovered, and we now have seventeen. Again, there\nis a rhetorical rule, almost never disregarded, which requires a literary work\nto end with an epilogue in the form of a little prayer for the welfare of\nreaders or auditors. Kalidasa himself complies with this rule, certainly in\nfive of his other six books. Once again, Kalidasa has nothing of the tragedian\nin his soul; his works, without exception, end happily. In the drama _Urvashi_\nhe seriously injures a splendid old tragic story for the sake of a happy\nending. These facts all point to the probability that the conclusion of the\nepic has been lost. We may even assign a natural, though conjectural, reason\nfor this. _The Dynasty of Raghu_ has been used for centuries as a text-book in\nIndia, so that manuscripts abound, and commentaries are very numerous. Now if\nthe concluding cantos were unfitted for use as a text-book, they might very\neasily be lost during the centuries before the introduction of printing-\npresses into India. Indeed, this very unfitness for use as a school text seems\nto be the explanation of the temporary loss of several cantos of Kalidasa\'s\nsecond epic.\n\nOn the other hand, we are met by the fact that numerous commentators, living\nin different parts of India, know the text of only nineteen cantos.\nFurthermore, it is unlikely that Kalidasa left the poem incomplete at his\ndeath; for it was, without serious question, one of his earlier works. Apart\nfrom evidences of style, there is the subject-matter of the introductory\nstanzas, in which the poet presents himself as an aspirant for literary fame.\nNo writer of established reputation would be likely to say:\n\nThe fool who seeks a poet\'s fame,  \nMust look for ridicule and blame,  \nLike tiptoe dwarf who fain would try  \nTo pluck the fruit for giants high.\n\n[paragraph continues] In only one other of his writings, in the drama which\nwas undoubtedly written earlier than the other two dramas, does the poet thus\npresent his feeling of diffidence to his auditors.\n\np. 150\n\nIt is of course possible that Kalidasa wrote the first nineteen cantos when a\nyoung man, intending to add more, then turned to other matters, and never\nafterwards cared to take up the rather thankless task of ending a youthful\nwork.\n\nThe question does not admit of final solution. Yet who-ever reads and re-reads\n_The Dynasty of Raghu_ , and the other works of its author, finds the\nconviction growing ever stronger that our poem in nineteen cantos is\nmutilated. We are thus enabled to clear the author of the charge of a lame and\nimpotent conclusion.\n\nAnother adverse criticism cannot so readily be disposed of; that of a lack of\nunity in the plot. As the poem treats of a kingly dynasty, we frequently meet\nthe cry: The king is dead. Long live the king! The story of Rama himself\noccupies only six cantos; he is not born until the tenth canto, he is in\nheaven after the fifteenth. There are in truth six heroes, each of whom has to\ndie to make room for his successor. One may go farther and say that it is not\npossible to give a brief and accurate title to the poem. It is not a Ramayana,\nor epic of Rama\'s deeds, for Rama is on the stage during only a third of the\npoem. It is not properly an epic of Raghu\'s line, for many kings of this line\nare unmentioned. Not merely kings who escape notice by their obscurity, but\nalso several who fill a large place in Indian story, whose deeds and\nadventures are splendidly worthy of epic treatment. _The Dynasty of Raghu_ is\nrather an epic poem in which Rama is the central figure, giving it such unity\nas it possesses, but which provides Rama with a most generous background in\nthe shape of selected episodes concerning his ancestors and his descendants.\n\nRama is the central figure. Take him away and the poem falls to pieces like a\npearl necklace with a broken string. Yet it may well be doubted whether the\ncantos dealing with Rama are the most successful. They are too compressed, too\nbriefly allusive. Kalidasa attempts to tell the story in about one-thirtieth\nof the space given to it by his great predecessor Valmiki. The result is much\nloss by omission and much loss by compression. Many of the best episodes of\nthe Ramayana are quite omitted by Kalidasa: for example; the story of the\njealous humpback who eggs on Queen Kaikeyi to demand her two boons; the\nbeautiful scene in\n\np. 151\n\nwhich Sita insists on following Rama into the forest; the account of the\nsomnolent giant Pot-ear, a character quite as good as Polyphemus. Other fine\nepisodes are so briefly alluded to as to lose all their charm: for example,\nthe story of the golden deer that attracts the attention of Rama while Ravana\nis stealing his wife; the journey of the monkey Hanumat to Ravana\'s fortress\nand his interview with Sita.\n\nThe Rama-story, as told by Valmiki, is one of the great epic stories of the\nworld. It has been for two thousand years and more the story _par excellence_\nof the Hindus; and the Hindus may fairly claim to be the best story-tellers of\nthe world. There is therefore real matter for regret in the fact that so great\na poet as Kalidasa should have treated it in a way not quite worthy of it and\nof himself. The reason is not far to seek, nor can there be any reasonable\ndoubt as to its truth. Kalidasa did not care to put himself into direct\ncompetition with Valmiki. The younger poet\'s admiration of his mighty\npredecessor is clearly expressed. It is with especial reference to Valmiki\nthat he says in his introduction:\n\nYet I may enter through the door  \nThat mightier poets pierced of yore;  \nA thread may pierce a jewel, but  \nMust follow where the diamond cut.\n\n[paragraph continues] He introduces Valmiki into his own epic, making him\ncompose the _Ramayana_ in Rama\'s lifetime. Kalidasa speaks of Valmiki as "the\npoet," and the great epic he calls "the sweet story of Rama," "the first path\nshown to poets," which, when sung by the two boys, was heard with motionless\ndelight by the deer, and, when sung before a gathering of learned men, made\nthem heedless of the tears that rolled down their cheeks.\n\nBearing these matters in mind, we can see the course of Kalidasa\'s thoughts\nalmost as clearly as if he had expressed them directly. He was irresistibly\ndriven to write the wonderful story of Rama, as any poet would be who became\nfamiliar with it. At the same time, his modesty prevented him from challenging\nthe old epic directly. He therefore writes a poem which shall appeal to the\nhallowed associations\n\np. 152\n\nthat cluster round the great name of Rama, but devotes two-thirds of it to\nthemes that permit him greater freedom. The result is a formless plot.\n\nThis is a real weakness, yet not a fatal weakness. In general, literary\ncritics lay far too much emphasis on plot. Of the elements that make a great\nbook, two, style and presentation of character, hardly permit critical\nanalysis. The third, plot, does permit such analysis. Therefore the analyst\noverrates its importance. It is fatal to all claim of greatness in a narrative\nif it is shown to have a bad style or to be without interesting characters. It\nis not fatal if it is shown that the plot is rambling. In recent literature it\nis easy to find truly great narratives in which the plot leaves much to be\ndesired. We may cite the _Pickwick Papers_ , _Les Mis erables_, _War and\nPeace_.\n\nWe must then regard _The Dynasty of Raghu_ as a poem in which single episodes\ntake a stronger hold upon the reader than does the unfolding of an ingenious\nplot. In some degree, this is true of all long poems. The _\xc3\x86 neid_ itself, the\nmost perfect long poem ever written, has dull passages. And when this\nallowance is made, what wonderful passages we have in Kalidasa\'s poem! One\nhardly knows which of them makes the strongest appeal, so many are they and so\nvaried. There is the description of the small boy Raghu in the third canto,\nthe choice of the princess in the sixth, the lament of King Aja in the eighth,\nthe story of Dasharatha and the hermit youth in the ninth, the account of the\nruined city in the sixteenth. Besides these, the Rama cantos, ten to fifteen,\nmake an epic within an epic. And if Kalidasa is not seen at his very best\nhere, yet his second best is of a higher quality than the best of others.\nAlso, the Rama story is so moving that a mere allusion to it stirs like a\nsentimental memory of childhood. It has the usual qualities of a good epic\nstory: abundance of travel and fighting and adventure and magic interweaving\nof human with superhuman, but it has more than this. In both hero and heroine\nthere is real development of character. Odysseus and \xc3\x86neas do not grow; they\ngo through adventures. But King Rama, torn between love for his wife and duty\nto his subjects, is almost a different person from the handsome, light-hearted\nprince who won his bride by breaking Shiva\'s bow. Sita, faithful\n\np. 153\n\nto the husband who rejects her, has made a long, character-forming journey\nsince the day when she left her father\'s palace, a youthful bride. Herein lies\nthe unique beauty of the tale of Rama, that it unites romantic love and moral\nconflict with a splendid story of wild adventure. No wonder that the Hindus,\nconnoisseurs of story-telling, have loved the tale of Rama\'s deeds better than\nany other story.\n\nIf we compare _The Dynasty of Raghu_ with Kalidasa\'s other books, we find it\ninferior to _The Birth of the War-god_ in unity of plot, inferior to\n_Shakuntala_ in sustained interest, inferior to _The Cloud-Messenger_ in\nperfection of every detail. Yet passages in it are as high and sweet as\nanything in these works. And over it is shed the magic charm of Kalidasa\'s\nstyle. Of that it is vain to speak. It can be had only at first hand. The\nfinal proof that _The Dynasty of Raghu_ is a very great poem, is this: no one\nwho once reads it can leave it alone thereafter.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[128:1](sha15.htm#fr_6) If a king aspired to the title of emperor, or king of\nkings, he was at liberty to celebrate the horse-sacrifice. A horse was set\nfree to wander at will for a year, and was escorted by a band of noble youths\nwho were not permitted to interfere with his movements. If the horse wandered\ninto the territory of another king, such king must either submit to be the\nvassal of the horse\'s owner, or must fight him. If the owner of the horse\nreceived the submission, with or without fighting, of all the kings into whose\nterritories the horse wandered during the year of freedom, he offered the\nhorse in sacrifice and assumed the imperial title.\n\n[129:1](sha15.htm#fr_7) This is not the place to discuss the many interesting\nquestions of geography and ethnology suggested by the fourth canto.
