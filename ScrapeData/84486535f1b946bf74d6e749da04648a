(There are) eight marriage-rites. 1\n\n2\\. If (the father) gives (his daughter) to a student (who has not broken his\nvow of chastity and) who asks for her, after fully enquiring into his learning\nand character, that (is) the rite .of Brahman (brahma). 2\n\n3\\. If (the father gives his daughter away) after clothing her and decking her\nwith ornaments, (saying) \'That (is thy wife), fulfil the law (with her),\' that\n(is) the rite of Pra _g_ apati (pra _g_ apatya). 3\n\n4\\. If (the bridegroom) after offering the first burnt oblation of parched\ngrain (receives the maiden) for a bull and a cow, that is the rite of the _Ri_\nshis (arsha). 4\n\n5\\. If (a maiden is given) to an officiating priest within the sacrificial\nenclosure, while the presents are being taken away, that (is) the rite of the\ngods (daiva). 5\n\np. 206\n\n6\\. The union of a lover with a loving damsel (is called) the rite of the\nGandharvas (gandharva).\n\n7\\. (If the bridegroom receives the maiden) after gladdening (the parents) by\nmoney, (that is) the rite of the Asuras (asura).\n\n8\\. (If the maiden is wedded) after being forcibly abducted, (that is) the\nrite of the Rakshasas (rakshasa).\n\n9\\. If one has intercourse with (a maiden) who is sleeping, intoxicated, or\nout of her senses (with fear or passion and weds her afterwards, that is) the\nrite of the Pi _s_ a _k_ as (pai _s_ a _k_ a).\n\n10\\. Among these (eight rites) the four first (named) are (lawful) for a\nBrahma _n_ a. Among these also each earlier named is preferable.\n\n11\\. Among the (four) later (named rites) each succeeding one is more sinful\n(than the preceding ones).\n\n12\\. Among these the sixth and the seventh agree with the law of the\nKshatriyas. For power is their attribute.\n\n6\\. Vasish _th_ a I, 33,\n\n7\\. Vasish _th_ a I, 35.\n\n8\\. Vasish _th_ a I, 34.\n\n9\\. Vish _n_ u XXIV, 26.\n\n10\\. Vish _n_ u XXIV, 27.\n\n12\\. Vish _n_ u XXIV, 28; Vasish _th_ a I, 29, 34. The meaning of the last\nclause is that as, according to I, 10, 18, 3, Brahman placed power in the\nKshatriyas, they may adopt marriage rites by which a disregard of\nconventionalities or strength is displayed.\n\np. 207\n\n13\\. The fifth and the eighth (are lawful) for Vai _s_ yas and _S_ udras. 13\n\n14\\. For Vai _s_ yas and _S_ udras are not particular about their wives, 14\n\n15\\. Because they are allowed (to subsist by such low occupations as)\nhusbandry and service. 15\n\n16\\. Some recommend the Gandharva rite for all (castes), because it is based\non (mutual) affection.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[205:1](sbe1453.htm#fr_1022) **20**. Vish _n_ u XXIV, 17.\n\n[205:2](sbe1453.htm#fr_1023) Vasish _th_ a I, 30. The word brahma _k_ arin\nhas, no doubt, as Govinda too contends, been used in the double sense of \'a\nstudent of the Veda\' and \'chaste.\'\n\n[205:3](sbe1453.htm#fr_1024) Vish _n_ u XXIV, 22.\n\n[205:4](sbe1453.htm#fr_1025) Vasish _th_ a I, 32. \'After the first of the\nburnt oblations of parched grain, which are prescribed for weddings, has been\noffered, the bridegroom shall give to him who has power over, the maiden a\nbull and a cow, and receive them back together with the (bride).\'--Govinda.\n\n[205:5](sbe1453.htm#fr_1026) Vasish _th_ a I, 31. According to this rule the\ndamsel is given p. 206 as part of the sacrificial fee (dakshi _n_ a) to one of\nthe priests after a sacrifice has been completed. Govinda adds that the\nrecipient has to accept the gift with the six mantras, \'pra _g_ apati striya\n_m_ ya _s_ a _h_ ,\' Taitt. Brahma _n_ a II, 4, 6, 5. In his commentary on the\npassage Saya _n_ a makes the same statement. Govinda adds that in this case as\nwell as in those mentioned in the following Sutras the regular marriage\nceremony must be performed later.\n\n[207:13](sbe1453.htm#fr_1027) \'I.e. the fifth for Vai _s_ yas and the eighth\nfor _S_ udras.\'--Govinda.\n\n[207:14](sbe1453.htm#fr_1028) \'Those whose spouse, i.e. wife, is not\nrestrained, i.e. not fixed by rule, are called not particular about their\nwives. The meaning is that there is oneness (dareshvaikyam) with respect to\nwives, that fixed rules regarding them there are none (niyamas tesha _m_ na\nbhavati).\'--Govinda.\n\n[207:15](sbe1453.htm#fr_1029) \'"Husbandry" includes also trade and the like.\nBecause those two (castes) are permitted to pursue low occupations, therefore\ntheir marriage rites are of the same description. That is what the author\nintends to say.\'--Govinda.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 11, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 21](sbe1454.htm)\n\n'
