Verily he who consecrates himself, consecrates himself for the sake\nof this All; for he consecrates himself for the sacrifice, and this All indeed\nresults from 2 the sacrifice; having prepared the sacrifice for which he\nconsecrates himself, he now sets free (or produces) this All.\n\n3:6:3:22\\. The reason why he performs the Vaisar _g_ ina offerings is this.\nThey are called Vaisar _g_ ina, because he sets free (vi-sar _g_ ) this All;\nwherefore let him who takes part in the rite 3 touch (the sacrificer) from\nbehind; but if he have to go elsewhere (on business) he need not heed this.\nWhen he sacrifices, he sets free this All.\n\n3:6:3:33\\. And again why he performs the Vaisar _g_ ina offerings. Vish _n_ u,\nforsooth, is the sacrifice; by his strides he obtained (vi-kram) for the gods\nthat all-pervading power (vikranti) which now belongs to them; by his first\nstep he gained this same (earth); by the second, the region of air; and by the\nlast,\n\np. 156\n\nthe heaven. And that same pervading power Vish _n_ u, the sacrifice, obtains\nby his strides for this (sacrificer) when he sacrifices: this is why he\nperforms the Vaisar _g_ ina offerings.\n\n3:6:3:44\\. In the afternoon, having covered the altar (with sacrificial\ngrass), and handed (to the sacrificer and his wife) one half of the fast-milk,\nthey enter (the hall), put fire-wood on 1, and prepare the under-layer (of\ngravel). He (the Adhvaryu) puts the butter on (the old Garhapatya), and cleans\nthe spoons. The sacrificer takes the king (Soma) on his lap. He (the Adhvaryu)\nscatters about the (dust of the) foot-print of the Soma-cow behind the (new)\nGarhapatya for the sake of a firm standing, for it is with the foot that one\nstands firmly.\n\n3:6:3:55\\. Now some divide it (the dust) into four parts 2: one fourth part\n(they put) into the under-layer whereon they take up the \xc3\x82havaniya (for\ntransferring it to the high altar); with one fourth part they anoint the axle;\none fourth part (they put) into this underlayer (for taking out the \xc3\x82gnidhriya\nfire); and one fourth part he scatters about behind the Garhapatya.\n\n3:6:3:66\\. But let him not do this; let him rather scatter it about entirely\nbehind the Garhapatya. Having then purified the ghee, he takes thereof four\nladlings (with the sruva), both in the _g_ uhu and in the upabh _ri_ t; and\nclotted ghee 3 in five ladlings, with (Va _g_. S. V, 35),\n\np. 157\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Thou art a light endowed with all forms, the flame of\nthe All-gods;' for the clotted ghee belongs to the All-gods. When the wood is\nwell kindled, they hold the spoons for him.\n\n3:6:3:77\\. He then offers 1, with, 'Thou, O Soma, wilt widely withhold thy\nprotection from the life-injuring 2 hatreds put forth by others, Hail!'\nThereby he takes a firm stand on this resting-place, the earth, and gains this\nworld.\n\n3:6:3:88\\. He then offers the second oblation to (Soma) the Nimble, with, 'May\nthe Nimble graciously accept the butter, Hail!' For he (Soma) spake upon that\ntime, 'Verily I am afraid of the Rakshas: do ye make me to be too small for\ntheir deadly shaft, so that the evil spirits (the Rakshas) shall not injure me\non the way; and take me across in the form of a drop, for the drop is nimble.'\nAnd accordingly, having made him too small for the deadly shaft, they lead him\nsafely across in the form of a drop, from fear of the Rakshas, for the drop is\nnimble: this is why he offers the second oblation to (Soma) the Nimble.\n\n3:6:3:99\\. They lift the (burning) fire-wood, and place it on the support. He\nthen says (to the Hot _ri_ ), 'Recite for Agni, taken forward!' or (say some),\n'--for Soma, led forward.' But let him say, 'Recite for Agni, taken forward\n3!'\n\np. 158\n\n3:6:3:1010\\. They take the pressing-stones, the Soma-trough (dro _n_ a-kala\n_s_ a); Vayu's cups 1, the (twenty pieces of) fire-wood, the enclosing-sticks\nof karshmarya wood (Gmelina Arborea), one prastara of a _s_ vavala grass 2,\nand the two Vidh _ri_ tis of sugarcane; that barhis (which was used before 3)\nis tied up therewith. Further, the two spits for (roasting) the omenta 4, the\ntwo ropes (for binding the stake and victims), the two churning-sticks (for\nproducing fire), the adhimanthana chip, and the two v _ri_ sha _n_ a 5,--\nhaving taken up all these they go forward (to the \xc3\x82gnidhra): thus the\nsacrifice goes upwards 6.\n\n3:6:3:1111\\. While they proceed thither, he makes (the sacrificer) say the\ntext (Va _g_. S. V, 36; Rig-veda I, 189, 1), 'O Agni, lead us on a good path\nunto wealth, thou, O God, that knowest all works! keep thou from us the sin\nthat leadeth astray, and we will offer unto thee most ample adoration!' He\nthereby places Agni in front, and Agni marches in front repelling the evil\nspirits; and they take him thither on a (way) free from danger and\n\np. 159\n\ninjury. They proceed, and reach the \xc3\x82gnidhra; and he (the Adhvaryu) puts (the\nfire) down on the \xc3\x82gnidhra hearth.\n\n3:6:3:1212\\. Thereon, when laid down, he offers with the text (Vas. S. V, 37),\n'May this Agni make wide room for us; may he march in front smiting the\nhaters! May he gain riches in the winning of riches: may he, fiercely rushing,\nconquer the enemies, Hail!' By means of him (Agni) he thus takes a firm stand\nin that resting-place, the aerial region, and gains that world.\n\n3:6:3:1313\\. In the same place they deposit the pressing-stones, the Soma-\ntrough, and Vayu's cups 1. Having then taken up the other (objects), they\nproceed and deposit them north of the \xc3\x82havaniya.\n\n3:6:3:1414\\. The Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water, and sprinkles first the\nfire-wood, and then the altar. They then hand to him the altar-grass. He puts\nit down with the knot towards the east, and sprinkles it. Having poured (the\nremaining sprinkling-water) upon (the root ends of the altar-grass), and\nuntied the knot,--the Prastara-hunch of a _s_ vavala grass is tied together\n(with the altar-grass),--he takes that; and having taken the Prastara, he\nspreads the altar-grass in a single layer. Having spread the altar-grass, he\nlays the enclosing-sticks of karshmarya-wood round (the fire). Having laid the\nenclosing-sticks around, he puts two kindling-sticks (on the fire); and having\nput on the two kindling-sticks,\n\n3:6:3:1515\\. He offers with the text (Va _g_. S. V., 38), 'Stride thou widely,\nO Vish _n_ u, make wide room for our abode! drink the ghee, thou born of ghee,\n\np. 160\n\nand speed the lord of the sacrifice ever onwards, Hail!' Thereby he takes a\nfirm stand in that resting-place, the sky: he thus gains that world by\noffering with that (verse).\n\n3:6:3:1616\\. And as to his offering with a verse addressed to Vish _n_ u, it\nwas thus that they made him (Soma) to be too small for the deadly shaft and\nled him safely across in the form of a drop, for the drop is nimble. And\nhaving attained to safety, he now makes him the one he really is, namely, the\nsacrifice, for Vish _n_ u is the sacrifice: therefore he offers with a verse\naddressed to Vish _n_ u.\n\n3:6:3:1717\\. After depositing the spoons 1 and touching water, he makes the\nking (Soma) enter (the Havirdhana shed). The reason why he makes the king\nenter, after depositing the spoons and touching water, is this. The ghee is\nthe thunderbolt, and Soma is seed: hence it is after depositing the spoons and\ntouching water that he makes the king enter, lest he should injure the seed\nSoma with the thunderbolt, the ghee.\n\n3:6:3:1818\\. He spreads the black deer-skin on the enclosed part of the\nsouthern Soma-cart, and sets him down thereon with (Va _g_. S. V, 39), 'O\ndivine Savit _ri_ , this is thy Soma: shield him; may they not injure thee!'\nwhereby he makes him over to the God Savit _ri_ for protection.\n\n3:6:3:1919\\. Having quitted his hold of him, he (the sacrificer) renders\nhomage to him with, 'Now, O divine Soma, hast thou, a god, joined the gods,\nand\n\np. 161\n\nhere I the men with increase of wealth.' Now Agni and Soma have seized him who\nconsecrates himself between their jaws 1, for that consecration-offering\nbelongs to Agni and Vish _n_ u, and Vish _n_ u forsooth is no other than Soma;\nand he himself that consecrates himself is the food of the gods: thus they\nhave seized him between their jaws, and he now expressly redeems himself from\nSoma, when he says, 'Now, O divine Soma, hast thou, a god, joined the gods,\nand here (have I joined) the men with increase of wealth;'--increase of wealth\nmeans abundance: 'with abundance' he thereby means to say.\n\n3:6:3:2020\\. He then walks out (of the cart-shed), with, 'Hail! I am freed\nfrom Varu _n_ a's noose!' For he, truly, is in Varu _n_ a's noose who is in\nanother's mouth: he now frees himself from Varu _n_ a's noose, when he says,\n'Hail! I am freed from Varu _n_ a's noose.'\n\n3:6:3:2121\\. He then puts a kindling-stick on the \xc3\x82havaniya in this way 2, 'O\nAgni, protector of vows, on thee, O protector of vows--' for Agni is lord of\nvows to the gods, wherefore he says, 'O Agni, protector of vows, on thee, O\nprotector of vows'--'what bodily form of thine hath been on me, (may) that\n(be) on thee; what bodily form of mine has been on thee, (may) that (be) here\non me! Our vows, O lord of vows, (have been performed) rightly: the lord of\nconsecration hath\n\np. 162\n\napproved my consecration; the lord of penance hath approved my penance.'\nThereby he frees himself visibly from Agni, and sacrifices with a self (body)\nnow his own: hence they now partake of his food, for he is a man (again);\nhence they now use his (real) name, for he is a man. And as to their not\neating (of his food) heretofore, it is as one would not eat of sacrificial\nfood, before offering has been made thereof: therefore let no one partake of\nthe food of one consecrated. He now loosens his fingers.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[155:2](sbe2625.htm#fr_412) Or, corresponds to (anu).\n\n[155:3](sbe2625.htm#fr_413) That is, a blood-relation of the sacrificer,\ndwelling together with him.
