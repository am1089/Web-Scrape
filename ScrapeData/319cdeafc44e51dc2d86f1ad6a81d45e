Once upon a time, N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da, the ornament of Parivr\xc4\x81jakas (roaming ascetics),\nafter roaming over all worlds and cleansing, through merely by looking at the\nplaces of pilgrimage able to impart rare religious merits, observed, with a\nmind that had attained purity, without hate, quiescent and patient, and\nindifferent towards all (objects), the forest of Naimi\xc5\x9ba (the modern Nims\xc4\x81r),\nfilled with \xe1\xb9\x9ashis that were engaged in the contemplation of Reality and had\nattained the greatness of the ordained bliss; (there) through the recitation\nof stories about Hari (Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u), associated with the musical motes of Sa, Ri,\nGa, Ma, Pa, \xe1\xb8\x8cha, and Ni (of the gamut), able to impart indifference to objects\nand to make one look down upon the universe, and instilling divine devotion,\nfixed and movable (or mental and bodily), he entered (the forest), fascinating\nthe crowds of beings human, animal, Kimpurushas 1, celestials, Kinnaras, 2\nApsaras (Houris), and Uragas 3 (collected there). (Thereupon the) great \xe1\xb9\x9ashis\n\xc5\x9a\xc4\x81unaka and others who had been engaged for twelve years in sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadra sacrifice\nwell-skilled in the recitation of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, the knowers of all, and the good\npractisers of \xe1\xb9\xadapas, observed N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da the son of Brahma and the devotee of the\nLord, and having\n\np. 135\n\nrisen up, paid due respect to him. Then having with due respect requested him\nto sit down, they also seated themselves and addressed him thus: "O Lord, son\nof Brahma, what is the means of salvation for us? It is meet that it should be\ncommunicated (to us)." Thus addressed, N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da replied to them thus: "One born\nin a good family and fit to go through the forty-four samsk\xc4\x81ras, upanayana and\nothers, should, under a teacher to whom he is devoted, study, after the\nrecitation of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8da of his own \xc5\x9b\xc4\x81kh\xc4\x81 (division), all the different branches\nof knowledge; then should fulfil, according to the rules ordained, for twelve\nyears the observance of Brahmacharya (celibacy), such as the service of the\nguru, etc.; then for twenty-five years the \xc4\x81\xc5\x9brama (order of life) of a\ng\xe1\xb9\x9bhas\xe1\xb9\xadha (householder), and for twenty-five years the \xc4\x81\xc5\x9brama of a v\xc4\x81napras\xe1\xb9\xadha\n(forester). After thus practising well the fourfold celibacy, 1 the sixfold 2\nhouseholder\'s life, and the fourfold 3 forester\'s life, and having performed\nall the duties thereof, he should acquire the fourfold 4 means of salvation;\nthus the sanny\xc4\x81sin who gives up the desires along with the karmas of mind,\nspeech, and body in this sams\xc4\x81ra as well as the v\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 towards the threefold\ndesire (of son, wife, and wealth), and being without malice and endowed with\nquiescence and patience, undisturbed in the order of life of Paramahamsa,\nquits the body in the contemplation of Reality, is an emancipated person. Such\nis the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n##### Upa\xe1\xb8\x8de\xc5\x9ba II\n\nAll the \xe1\xb9\x9ashis, \xc5\x9aaunaka and others addressing Lord N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da said thus: "O Lord,\nplease tell us the rules of sanny\xc4\x81sa." At which, seeing them, N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da replied:\n"It is but meet that we should know the whole truth from the mouth of Brahm\xc4\x81\n\np. 136\n\n[paragraph continues] Himself." After the sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadra sacrifice was completed, he\ntook the \xe1\xb9\x9bshis along with him to sa\xe1\xb9\xadyaloka; and after duly making prostrations\nto and eulogising Brahm\xc4\x81 engaged in meditation upon Brahman, he along with\nothers was duly seated under the orders of Brahm\xc4\x81. Then N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da addressed\nBrahm\xc4\x81 thus: "Thou art guru; thou art father; thou art the knower of the\nsecret of all learning; thou art the knower of all; thou shalt therefore tell\nme one secret. Who else but thee is fit to tell the secret dear unto me? It is\nthis. Please tell us the rules of the real sanny\xc4\x81sa (asceticism)."\n\nThus prayed to by N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da, Brahm\xc4\x81 surveyed all in the four quarters; and after\nmeditating for one muh\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\xada (48 minutes), and assuring himself that the inquiry\nwas truly for the purpose of escaping from the pain of sams\xc4\x81ra, Brahm\xc4\x81 eyeing\nN\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da, said thus: "The mystery that was imparted before by Vir\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad-Purusha of\nillimitable form according to the _Purusha-S \xc5\xabk\xe1\xb9\xada-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d_ is now being\ndivulged to you. It is very mysterious. It is fit to be hearkened to with\ngreat attention. O N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da, one born in a good family and obedient to his\nparents, should, after the performance of upanayana according to the rules,\nfind a virtuous guru that is other than his father, is of good custom and\nhabits, of faith, born of good family, a knower of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, a lover of \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras,\nof (good) qualities and free from duplicity. Having made prostrations and\nrendered useful service to him, he should respectfully acquaint him with his\nintention. Having studied all departments of knowledge and rendered service\nfor twelve years, he should, under his (the guru\'s) orders, marry a girl fit\nfor his family and dear unto him. Then having performed for twenty-five years\nthe karmas incidental to a householder and attained the status of a Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a\nthat has performed sacrifices and the rest, he should beget a son with the\nonly desire of perpetuating the family. After thus spending twenty-five years\nin the performance of household \xe1\xb8\x8dharma, he should bathe thrice daily for\ntwenty-five years and take only one meal in the fourth period; he should live\nalone in the forest, after giving up his previous wanderings in city and\nvillage; and without desire for fruit, should perform the karmas incidental to\nthat (forester\'s) order .of life, and be\n\np. 137\n\nwithout desire for objects seen and heard. Being skilled in the forty\nsamsk\xc4\x81ras, he should be devoid of desire for all, have a purified mind, have\nburnt up desire, jealousy, envy and egoism, and have developed the four means\nof salvation. Then he becomes fit for sanny\xc4\x81sa. Such is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n##### Upa\xe1\xb8\x8de\xc5\x9ba III\n\nThen N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da addressed the grandfather thus:\n\n"O Lord, by whom, after attaining the qualifications of sanny\xc4\x81sa, is it fit to\nbe taken?" To which Brahma, replied: "After first expounding the\nqualifications of sanny\xc4\x81sa, the rules of sanny\xc4\x81sa will then be stated. Hearken\ncarefully. A eunuch, the outcaste, the maimed, the lewd, the deaf, the youth,\nthe dumb, the heretic, the discus-bearer, the Li\xe1\xb9\x85ga-wearer, the vaikh\xc4\x81nasa\n(forester), the Hara\xe1\xb8\x8dhvaja (carrier of \xc5\x9aiva\'s flag), the reciter of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das for\nhire, the bald-headed, one without (sacrificial) fire--all these, even though\nthey have attained vair\xc4\x81gya are unfit for sanny\xc4\x81sa. Even though they have\nbecome sanny\xc4\x81sins, they are unfit to be initiated into the mah\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81kyas (sacred\nve\xe1\xb8\x8dic sentences). The Paramahamsa sanny\xc4\x81sin stated before (as fit to take\nsanny\xc4\x81sa) is the one qualified. It is stated in the sm\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadis that he is a\nparivr\xc4\x81t who is not afraid of others, as others are not afraid of him. The\neunuch, the limbless, the blind, the youth, the sinful, the outcaste, the\ndoor-keeper, the vaikh\xc4\x81nasa, the Hara\xe1\xb8\x8dhvaja, the chakr\xc4\xab (discus-bearer), the\nLi\xe1\xb9\x85g\xc4\xab (Li\xe1\xb9\x85ga-wearer), the heretic, the bald-headed, one without fire\n(sacrifice), one that had undergone sanny\xc4\x81sa twice or thrice, the reciter of\nVe\xe1\xb8\x8das for hire--all these are not fit for regular sanny\xc4\x81sa but only for \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadura-\nsanny\xc4\x81sa ( _viz_., sanny\xc4\x81sa taken while a person is afflicted, etc.). What is\nthe opinion of \xc4\x81ryas (Hin\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc5\xabs) on the (fit) time for \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadura-sanny\xc4\x81sa (being\ntaken)? The time when pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a (life) is about to rise (out of the body) is\ncalled \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadura. The time other than it is incapable of conferring (upon one) the\npath of salvation and is not \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadura. Even in \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadura-sanny\xc4\x81sa, the wise should\naccording to rules, initiate themselves into sanny\xc4\x81sa after reciting the\n\np. 138\n\nman\xe1\xb9\xadras again and again in the course of respective man\xe1\xb9\xadras. There is no\ndifference between regular and \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadura-sanny\xc4\x81sa in the man\xe1\xb9\xadras to be uttered at\nthe time of taking sanny\xc4\x81sa. There is no karma without man\xe1\xb9\xadras; (hence) karma\nneeds man\xe1\xb9\xadras. Anything done without man\xe1\xb9\xadra cannot be termed karma. Hence\nman\xe1\xb9\xadras should not be given up. Any karma done without man\xe1\xb9\xadra is like an\noffering made in ashes. Through the conciseness (of the performance) of the\nkarmas, it is stated to be \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadura-sanny\xc4\x81sa.\n\n"Therefore, O Muni, the recitation of man\xe1\xb9\xadras is stated to be in \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadura-\nsanny\xc4\x81sa. One who is always duly doing agniho\xe1\xb9\xadra (fire-sacrifice) should, when\nhe quits (the house) for foreign places through indifference, perform the\npr\xc4\x81j\xc4\x81pa\xe1\xb9\xadya sacrifice in water and then take up sanny\xc4\x81sa. After completing in\nwater the observances of karma through the mind, or the recitation of man\xe1\xb9\xadras,\nthe wise man should attain sanny\xc4\x81sa. Else he becomes a fallen man. When, in\nthe mind, indifference to all objects arises, then men should long after\nsanny\xc4\x81sa, (that being the best time for it); otherwise they are fallen. One\nwho attains vair\xc4\x81gya should take sanny\xc4\x81sa. One who does not, should remain at\nhome. That vile twice-born with desire, should he take sanny\xc4\x81sa, reaches hell.\nThat Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a who is a celibate, who has under control his tongue, sexual\norgan, stomach, and hand may become a sanny\xc4\x81sin without undergoing the\nceremony of marriage. Having known sams\xc4\x81ra as one without s\xc4\x81ra (or essence)\nand not having undergone any marriage on account of the desire to know the\ns\xc4\x81ra (or essence of God), they become sanny\xc4\x81sins on account of the practice of\nthe supreme vair\xc4\x81gya. The characteristic of prav\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi (path) is the performance\nof karma; that of niv\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi is j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. Therefore placing j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na in the forefront,\nthe wise man should take up sanny\xc4\x81sa. When the reality of the eternal\nParabrahman is understood, then he should take up one \xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\x87da (staff) and\nabandon the holy thread and tuft of hair. Then he becomes fit to eat the alms-\nfood (of sanny\xc4\x81sa), having become devoted to Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, indifferent to those\nthat are not-Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and freed from all desires. He becomes fit to be the\neater of\n\np. 139\n\nalms-food who preserves the same countenance when he is beaten, as when he is\nworshipped or prostrated to. He becomes fit to be the eater of alms-food who\nis of the firm certitude that he is no other than the non-dual and\nindestructible Brahman, otherwise named V\xc4\x81su\xe1\xb8\x8deva. He in whom are existent\n\xc5\x9b\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadi (control of the organs), \xc5\x9bama (control of mind), purity (of mind and\nbody), sa\xe1\xb9\xadya (truth), san\xe1\xb9\xadosha (contentment), \xc4\x81rjava (straightforwardness),\npoverty, and non-ostentatiousness should be in the order of life of kaivalya\n(sanny\xc4\x81sa). When one does not, through actions, mind, or speech, commit any\nsinful action to any being, then he becomes fit for eating alms-food. Having\nbecome quiescent (through the control of the mind), having practised the ten\nkinds of \xe1\xb8\x8dharmas, having, according to rules, studied ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada, and having paid\nthe three debts (to \xe1\xb8\x8devas, \xe1\xb9\x9bshis, and pi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\x9bs), one should take up sanny\xc4\x81sa.\nCourage, fortitude, the control of the body, honesty, purity of (mind and\nbody), control of the (inner) organs, shame, knowledge, truth, and absence of\nanger--these ten are the characteristics of \xe1\xb8\x8dharma. One who does not look back\n(with pleasure) upon past enjoyments, nor forward into the future, and one who\ndoes not rejoice in the present, is fit to become a sanny\xc4\x81sin. One who is able\nto control within, the inner organs and without, the external organs, may be\nin the order of life of kaivalya. One who while in life is not affected by\npleasures and pains, as the body is unaffected by them after death, may be in\nthe order of life of kaivalya.\n\n"An ascetic of the Paramahamsa (order) shall wear two loin-cloths, one ragged\ncloth, and one staff. Nothing more is ordained (in his case). Should he\nthrough desire wear more than these, he will fall into the hell of raurava and\nbe born into the womb of an animal. Having stitched together old and clean\ncloths into one and having coloured it with red (ochre), he should wear it as\nhis upper cloth. He may be with one cloth or even without it. He should roam\nabout alone with the sole vision (of Brahman), devoid of desires; but he may\nbe in one place alone in the rainy season. Having quite abandoned his family,\nincluding son and wife, ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada, sacrifice, and the sacred thread, the ascetic\nshould wander incognito.\n\np. 140\n\n[paragraph continues] Having given up all faults, such as passion, anger,\npride, desire, and delusion, the parivr\xc4\x81t (ascetic) should become one that\nowns nothing. He is a muni who is devoid of love and hate, who regards equally\na clod of earth, stone, or gold, who does no injury to any living creature,\nand is freed from all. That ascetic reaches salvation who is associated with\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, who is freed from ostentation and egoism, from doing injury and\ntale-bearing. Through attraction to the senses, he becomes subject to fault,\nthere is no doubt: through their control, he gains perfection. Lust when\nenjoyed is never gratified. Just as fire increases with the oblation (of ghee,\netc., poured into it) so also lust waxes strong (with enjoyment). It should be\nknown that that man who does not rejoice or grieve through hearing, touching,\neating, seeing, or smelling is a ji\xe1\xb9\xaden\xe1\xb8\x8driya (conqueror of the organs). He\nwhose speech and mind are well brought under control attains, completely and\nalways, all the fruits of ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada.\n\n"That Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a who is always afraid of respect as poison and always longs\nafter disrespect as nectar, sleeps soundly and rises happily even though he is\ntreated with disrespect. He moves about happily in this world. The one who\ntreats him with disrespect perishes. All cruel words should be endured. None\nshould be treated with disrespect. On account of bodily relationship, none\nshould be made inimical. No anger should be directed in turn towards one who\nis angry. Soft words (only) should be spoken, even when (violently) pulled by\nanother. No untrue words should be uttered, even should afflictions arise to\nthe seven gates (of the body). One desirous of bliss should dwell in this\nuniverse through the aid of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 alone, intent upon \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, free from desires,\nand without the desire of blessing (others). He becomes fit for salvation\nthrough the control of the organs, the destruction of love and hate and non-\ninjury to beings. He should abandon (all identification with) this feeble,\nperishable, and impure body of five elements whereof the bones are the\npillars, which is strung by the nerves, coated over with flesh and blood,\ncovered up by the skin, is of bad odour, full of urine and faeces is ever\nhaunted by dotage and miseries and is the seat of all ills. If an ignorant man\nbe fond of this body firmly knit together\n\np. 141\n\nwith flesh, blood, pus, faeces, and urine, nerves, fat, and bones, he would,\n_a fortiori_ , be fond of hell. That (identification of the body with the\nSelf) is alone the seat of the K\xc4\x81las\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra hell. That is alone the Mah\xc4\x81-V\xc4\xabchi-\nV\xc4\x81gura (hell). That is alone the Asipa\xe1\xb9\xadravana\xc5\x9bre\xe1\xb9\x87i (hell). Such an idea of the\nbody being the Self should be strenuously abandoned, though all should perish.\nThat love of the body is not fit to be felt by one intent upon his welfare,\njust as a low-caste woman eating dog\'s flesh is unfit to be touched.\n\n"One (fit to reach salvation), after leaving all meritorious actions to those\ndear to him and all sins to those not dear, attains the eternal Brahman\nthrough \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na-yoga. Such a man, through the ordinances, gives up little by\nlittle all associations, and being freed from all pairs of opposites, remains\nin Brahman alone. On account of the accomplishment (of salvation), he should\nbe moving about alone and without any help. He who having understood the\neffect of being alone never derogates from it, is never left in want. The\nbowl, the foot of the tree, the tattered robe,. the state of being without\nhelp, the equality of vision in all these are the characteristics of the\nemancipated one. One intent upon the welfare of all beings, with a quiescent\nmind, having the three-knotted staff and bowl, and ever devoted to the One\n(Brahman), after taking up sanny\xc4\x81sa, may enter a village. Such one is a\nbhikshu (alms-taker). Should two unite, it is called mi\xe1\xb9\xadhuna (a pair or\nunion); with three, it becomes a gr\xc4\x81ma (or village); with more, it is a nagara\n(or city). No city or village, or, mi\xe1\xb9\xadhuna should be made, and an ascetic who\ncommits these three (offences) falls from his duty. Through such intercourse\n(of ascetics), all kinds of talks connected with the king and alms,\nfriendship, tale-bearing, and malice occur between them. There is no doubt of\nit.\n\n"He (the ascetic) should be alone and desireless. He should not converse with\nanybody. The ascetic should ever be uttering the word N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a in each\nsentence. Being alone, he should be meditating upon Brahman in all mental,\nspoken, and bodily actions. He should neither rejoice at dying or living. He\nshould be anticipating the time when life will close. He should\n\np. 142\n\nnot be glad of dying; nor should he be glad of living. He should be biding his\ntime like a hireling (for his pay). An ascetic who plays the part of the dumb,\nthe eunuch, the lame, the blind, the deaf, and the idiot is emancipated\nthrough the (above six) means. There is no doubt of this. He who has not\nfondness for eating, saying that this is good and that is bad, who speaks only\nwords that are beneficial, true, and moderate is said to be the dumb. He is a\neunuch who is no more affected by the sight of a sixteen years old girl than\nof a new-born female baby or a hundred-years old woman. He who does not move\nabout for more than the distance of a yojana for alms or for the calls of\nnature is a lame man. That parivr\xc4\x81t (ascetic) is said to be a blind man, who\nwhether sitting or walking, has his vision extended to no more than four\nyokes\' distance on the ground. He is said to be deaf who, though hearing\nwords, beneficial or non-beneficial, pleasant or painful to the mind, is as if\nhe does not hear them. That clever ascetic is said to be an idiot who is ever\nin a state of sleep, as it were, having his organs non-agitated by objects,\neven though near. He should never observe the following six--the scenes of\ndancing, etc., gambling, lovely women, eatables, enjoyables, and women in\ntheir monthly course.\n\n"The ascetic should never in thought even think of others with the six (\n_viz_.,) love, hate, pride, deceit, treachery, and the illusion (of\nconfounding them). To the ascetics, the following six are sinful: cot, white\ncloth, the stories of women, love towards women, sleep during the day, and\nvehicles. He who is engaged in \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmic contemplation should carefully avoid a\nlong journey. He should ever practise the upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8dic vi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 tending to\nsalvation. The ascetic need not bathe daily. He need not observe upav\xc4\x81sa\n(fast). He need not be one that had studied Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. He need not be one that is\nable to produce a commentary (lecture). He should daily observe acts without\nsin, deceit, or falsehood. He who, having withdrawn the organs within, like a\nturtle its limbs (within its shell), is with the actions of the organs and the\nmind annihilated, without desires, without possessing any object as his own,\nwithout dualities, without prostrations, without the oblations to pity \xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81s\n(they being with desires), without\n\np. 143\n\nmine or I, without awaiting anything, without the desire to be happy, and\nliving in places where men do not live--he alone is emancipated. There is no\ndoubt of this.\n\n"A celibate, or householder, or forester, who is (ever) vigilant, has karma,\ndevotion, and knowledge and is independent, after understanding his peculiar\ntendency and having become indifferent (to his order of life), may become an\nhouseholder after ending the celibate life, or may from the householder\'s life\nenter the life of a foresters and then the life of an ascetic; or from the\nlife of a celibate, or householder, or forester may (directly) enter that of\nan ascetic. The moment vair\xc4\x81gya arises in him, he may become an ascetic that\nmoment, whether he is with vra\xe1\xb9\xada (religious observance) or not, is sn\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadaka 1\nor not, or with a discontinued fire-sacrifice or not. On account of that, some\nperform Pr\xc4\x81j\xc4\x81pa\xe1\xb9\xadya-sacrifice alone; or \xc4\x80gneya-sacrifice may be performed. Is\nnot agni, pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a? Through this alone, one should perform that sacrifice only\nwhich is connected with the three dh\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadus. The three \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadus are sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva, rajas,\nand \xe1\xb9\xadamas alone. With the man\xe1\xb9\xadra,\n\n![](img/14300.jpg),\n\nagni (fire) should be taken in. Thus it is said (in the \xc5\x9aru\xe1\xb9\xadis):\n\n![](img/14301.jpg).\n\nThe agni from \xc4\x81havan\xc4\xabya should be brought and taken in as before (with the\nman\xe1\xb9\xadras above mentioned). Should such an agni be not obtainable, the homa\n(oblation) should be done in water with the man\xe1\xb9\xadra,\n\n![](img/14302.jpg).\n\n[paragraph continues] After performing homa, the water should be taken in and\nsipped. After uttering the man\xe1\xb9\xadra,\n\n![](img/14303.jpg),\n\nhe abandons the tuft of hair in the head, the holy thread, father, son, wife,\nkarma, ve\xe1\xb8\x8dic study and man\xe1\xb9\xadra and becomes an ascetic. The \xc5\x9aru\xe1\xb9\xadis say that a\nknower of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 should be engaged in meditation upon Brahman, through the three\nman\xe1\xb9\xadras tending to salvation."\n\nThen N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da asked Brahma thus: "How can one, without the holy thread, be a\nBr\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a?" To which Brahma replied: "The wise should, after shaving (the head)\ntogether with the\n\np. 144\n\ntuft of hair, cast off the holy thread. He should wear, as his s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra (thread),\nthe indestructible and supreme Brahman. On account of (s\xc5\xabchan\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad) its being an\nindication, it (thread) is called s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra. S\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra is the Paramapa\xe1\xb8\x8da (supreme\nseat). He by whom that s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra is known is Br\xc4\x81hman. That s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra (thread of\nBrahman) in which is strung the whole universe like beads on a s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra (string),\nshould be worn by the yogin that has known yoga and \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva. The wise man that\nis in supreme yoga should abandon the outer s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra (thread). He who wears (in\nhis heart) this s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra of Br\xc4\x81hmic Reality is alone Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a. Through wearing\nthis higher s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra, it becomes not a rejected one, not an impure one. Those\nonly whose s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra is internal, having the holy thread as j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na are the real\nknowers of the s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra; they are said to possess the yajnopav\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada (holy thread).\nTo those whose \xc5\x9bikh\xc4\x81 (tuft of hair) is j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, whose holy thread is j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, and\nwhose meditation is upon j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na alone is supreme. It is said that j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na\nalone is able to purify. That wise man alone who possesses the j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na-\xc5\x9bikh\xc4\x81\nlike the \xc5\x9bikh\xc4\x81 (flame) of agni (fire) is said to possess \xc5\x9bikh\xc4\x81 (tuft of hair).\nThose that have mere \xc5\x9bikh\xc4\x81 are no \xc5\x9bikh\xc4\xabs. The Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as and others that are\nentitled to perform the ve\xe1\xb8\x8dic karmas are allowed to wear the (external)\nthread, only as an auxiliary to the karmas. It is only ve\xe1\xb8\x8dic. The knowers of\nBrahman know that all Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87ya (the state of Brahman) accrues to him only\nthat has the j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81namaya \xc5\x9bikh\xc4\x81 (knowledge-tuft of hair) and the \xe1\xb9\xadanmaya (That or\nBrahman-ful) upav\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada (holy thread).\n\n"Having known it, a Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a should take up sanny\xc4\x81sa. Such a sanny\xc4\x81sin, should\nbe, in order to bear the bodily afflictions, with one cloth, bald-headed and\nwithout having anything as being required (for his use); or according to\nrules, he may be (naked) as nature made his body, and should abandon his son,\nfriend, wife, trustworthy relatives, etc., as well as all karmas and love for\nthe universe, the loin-cloth, staff, and covering. Enduring all pairs of\nopposites without cold or heat, happiness or grief, fame or disgrace, without\nthe six changes, I-ness, malice, pride, ostentation, jealousy, slander of\nothers, love and hate, pleasure and pain, passion, anger, greed and\n\np. 145\n\ndelusion and regarding his body as a mere carcase, without thinking of all the\nthings, internal and external, that are other than Self. Without prostrations,\nwithout the worship of \xe1\xb8\x8devas and pi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\x9bs and without praise or condemnation, he\nshould wander about of his own accord. He should not receive gold and others.\nFor him, there is no invocation or dismissal (of deities), man\xe1\xb9\xadra or non-\nman\xe1\xb9\xadra, meditation or worship, aim or non-aim, others or not-others; without\nhaving another\'s or (his own) settled place of residence, and having a firm\nconviction, he should be in a desolate house or at the foot of trees, or in a\ntemple, a plenteous turfed spot, a potter\'s place or that of agniho\xe1\xb9\xadra or\nsacrifice, river, tank, sand-heap, subterranean vault, cave, mountain-rill,\nthe place prepared for sacrifice or forest; or like the naked personages,\n\xc5\x9ave\xe1\xb9\xadake\xe1\xb9\xadu, \xe1\xb9\x9abhu, Ni\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81gha, Jadabhara\xe1\xb9\xada, \xe1\xb9\x9ashabha, \xe1\xb8\x8curv\xc4\x81sas, Samvar\xe1\xb9\xadaka,\nSana\xe1\xb9\xadsuj\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xada, Vai\xe1\xb8\x8deha (Janaka), Vatasi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha, \xc5\x9auka, V\xc4\x81ma\xe1\xb8\x8deva, \xe1\xb8\x8ca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadreya,\nRaiva\xe1\xb9\xadaka, and Goraksha, he should roam about as nature made him, without\nbeing recognised and without any means of discovery of his course of life,\nlike a lad, or an insane man, or a ghost, with the actions of a madman though\nnot mad, after discarding in water the three-knotted staff, the stringed sling\n(bag), vessel, bowl, waist-string, loin-cloth, stick, and cloth. He should\never be engaged in \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmic deliberation. Being in his natural state without\nbeing affected by the pairs, without receiving anything, being ever settled\nfirmly in the Br\xc4\x81hmic path, having a pure mind, eating the food that is\nobtained without asking, in the palm as vessel, or in another\'s vessel in\norder to merely protect the body at the [time](errata.htm#9) required, being\nof equal mind whether the object is gained or not, without having aught of his\nown, always meditating upon Brahman, being with \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma-nishth\xc4\x81, having\neradicated all actions, virtuous and sinful, and having given up all--that one\nwho ever utters Brahma-Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, that "I am Brahman" alone, with the blissful\nand non-dual j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, and after rising above the three bodies (to Brahman), like\nthe analogy of the wasp and the worm, 1 gives up the body as a\n\np. 146\n\nsanny\xc4\x81sin, is said to have done all his work (in this world). Such is the\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n### Upa\xe1\xb8\x8de\xc5\x9ba IV\n\n"One who after giving up the world, the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, the objects and the organs is\nin \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 alone, attains the supreme abode. A good ascetic should not make known\nhis caste, name, go\xe1\xb9\xadra (clan), etc., his place and time, the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, etc.\nstudied by him, his family, age, history, observance, and conduct. He should\nneither converse with women nor remember the women he had seen. He should give\nup all stories connected with women. He should not even see the figure of a\nwoman in a picture. The mind of an ascetic who through delusion adopts the\nabove four things connected with women is necessarily affected and thereby\nperishes. The following are prohibited (in his case): Thirst, malice,\nfalsehood, deceit, greed, delusion, the pleasant and the unpleasant, manual\nwork, lecture, yoga, k\xc4\x81ma (passion), desire, begging, I-ness, mine-ness, the\nobstinacy of curing diseases, penance, pilgrimage and the accomplishment of\nfruits of man\xe1\xb9\xadras, and medicines. He who performs these interdicted things,\ngoes into a debased state. A muni who has moksha as his supreme seat should\naddress such respectful words as "Please come, please go, please stay, and\nwelcome" to one, even though he be his intimate friend. He should neither\nreceive presents, etc., nor ask for them to be given to others. Even in dream,\nan ascetic should never direct a person (to do work for him). Even should he\nwitness or hear of the happiness or grief of his wife, brother, son, and other\nrelatives, he should not be affected thereby. He should abandon all joy and\nsorrow.\n\n"To the ascetics controlling their mind, the following are their sva\xe1\xb8\x8dharmas\n(own duties): Harmlessness, truth, honesty, celibacy, non-coveting, humility,\nhigh-spiritedness, clearness of mind, steadiness of mind, straightforwardness,\nnon-attachment (to any), service to the guru, faith, patience, bodily\nrestraint, mental restraint, indifference, firm and sweet words, endurance,\ncompassion, shame, j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, yoga, moderate food, and\n\np. 147\n\ncourage. That paramahamsa of an ascetic in the order of life of a sanny\xc4\x81sin\nwho is without dualities, always follows the pure sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvagu\xe1\xb9\x87a and sees all\nequally, is no other than the actual N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a Himself. He may live one day in\na village and five days in a city, but five months in the wintry season. At\nother times he should live in other places (such as forest, etc.). He should\nnot live in a village for two days (even); should he do so, desires and the\nrest will arise in him and thereby he becomes fit for hell. He should live\nlike a (harmless) worm on the earth with his mind under control and with no\nsettled place of residence, at the end of the village where there are no\npersons. He may live in the same place in the wintry season. He should roam\nabout on the earth with one or no cloth, with the one vision (of Brahman)\nalone, with no desires (of objects), with no condemnation of the actions of\nthe wise and with meditation. That yogin of an ascetic should go about,\nobserving the duties of his order of life, and with the eyes cast on the\nearth, in pure places. He should not roam about in night, midday or the two\ntwilight periods in which are places void or difficult to be waded through or\nlikely to injure living creatures. He may live for one day in a village, for\nthree days in a town, for two days in a hamlet and for five days in a city. He\nmay live in the wintry season (longer) in one place surrounded fully by water.\nThe ascetic should regard all creatures as Self and dwell upon earth like the\nblind, the hunchback, the deaf, the insane, and the dumb. The bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka and the\nforester should bathe thrice a day. In the case of hamsa, one bath only is\nordained; but none in the case of a paramahamsa. In the case of the one having\none staff, seven things are ordained, _viz_., silence, yoga-posture, yoga,\nendurance, solitariness, desirelessness, and equal vision over all. Bathing\nbeing not prescribed for a paramahamsa, he should abandon all the\nmodifications of the mind only; what is the difference between the worms and\nthe men that rejoice over this ill-smelling body which is but a collection of\nskin, flesh, blood, nerves, fat, marrow, bone, offal and urine? What is the\nbody but a collection of all, phlegm, etc.? And what are the qualities, the\nv\xc4\x81sana of the\n\np. 148\n\nbody, effulgence, beauty, etc.? (They are opposed to one another.) The\nignorant man that is fond of this body, which is but a compound of flesh,\nblood, the ill-smelling urine and offal, nerve, fat and bone, will be fond of\nhell too. Though there is no difference between the women\'s secret parts that\ncannot be described by words and an (ever) oozing tubular wound, yet through\nthe difference of the mind, (men are deluded). Such men are said to be without\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, ( _viz_., dead) though alive. Prostrations to those that sport in that\npiece of flesh which is rent in twain and tainted with the breaking of the\nwind, etc. What more revolting thing is there than this?\n\n"To the wise, there is nothing to do, no sign (of identification). The muni\nwho is without \'mine\' and fear, with quiescence, without duality and eating\nleaf (alone), should ever be in meditation with either loin-cloth or no cloth.\nA yogin who is thus in meditation becomes fit to be Brahman. Though he may\nhave some signs (of identification to pass under this order of life or that),\nsuch signs are useless for gaining moksha. The cause of salvation is j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na\nalone. He is a (true) br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a who cannot be identified as sa\xe1\xb9\xad (good person)\nor asa\xe1\xb9\xad, knower of religious books or not, follower of good conduct or bad\nconduct. Therefore that learned man who is without signs, a knower of \xe1\xb8\x8dharma,\nengaged in the actions of Brahman and a knower of the secret mysteries, should\nroam about, incognito. He should go about on this earth without any caste or\norder of life and without being (even) doubted (regarding his identity) by any\nbeings, like the blind, the idiot, or the mute. Then (even) the angels become\nfond of him who has a quiescent mind. It is the dictate of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das that the\nsign (of non-identification) itself is Kaivalya."\n\nThen N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da asked the Grandfather about the rules of sanny\xc4\x81sa. To which\nBrahma- assented and said: "Before either the \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadura or regular sanny\xc4\x81sa is\ntaken, k\xe1\xb9\x9bchchhra penance should be done and then the eight \xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhas. In each\nof the (eight) \xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhas, two br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as should be fed, in lieu of Vi\xc5\x9bve\xe1\xb8\x8devas\ncalled Sa\xe1\xb9\xadyavasu and the (\xe1\xb9\xacrim\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\xadis called) Brahm\xc4\x81, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, and Mahe\xc5\x9bvara, in\n\xe1\xb8\x8ceva\xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha first; then in \xe1\xb9\x9ashi\xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha in lieu of \xe1\xb8\x8ceva\xe1\xb9\x9bshi, R\xc4\x81ja\xe1\xb9\x9bshi, and\nManushya\xe1\xb9\x9bshi; then\n\np. 149\n\nin \xe1\xb8\x8civya\xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha, in lieu of Vasu, Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra, and \xc4\x80\xe1\xb8\x8di\xe1\xb9\xadyas; then in manushya\xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha\nin lieu of Sanaka, Sanan\xe1\xb8\x8dana, Sana\xe1\xb9\xadkum\xc4\x81ra, and Sana\xe1\xb9\xadsuj\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xada; then in\nbh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada\xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha, in lieu of the five great elements, p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab, etc., eye and other\norgans and the four kinds of collections of bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadas; then in Pi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\x9b\xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha, in\nlieu of father, grandfather and great-grandfather; then in m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\x9b\xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha, in\nlieu of mother, mother\'s father and mother\'s grandfather; and then in\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma\xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha, in lieu of himself, his father and grandfather or of himself,\ngrandfather and great-grandfather, should his father be alive. He should\nperform the eight \xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhas in one day, or eight days, with the man\xe1\xb9\xadras of his\n\xc5\x9b\xc4\x81kh\xc4\x81 in one y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1apaksha or eight y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1apakshas. Then he should worship and\nfeed the br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as according to the rules contained in pi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\x9byaj\xc3\xb1a. Then\noffering the pi\xe1\xb9\x87das (balls of rice to the pi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\x9bs), he should gladden the\nbr\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as with the \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81mb\xc5\xabla (nut and betel, etc.,) presents and dismiss them.\nThen for the accomplishment of the remaining karmas, he should pluck off seven\nhairs; then again for finishing the rest of the karmas, he should hold seven\nor eight hairs and have the head shaved. Except his arm-pit and secret parts,\nhe should have the hairs of his head, whiskers and mustache and nails shaved.\nAfter shaving, he should bathe and perform the evening san\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81, uttering\nG\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab a thousand times. Then performing brahmayaj\xc3\xb1a, he should establish his\nown fire and acting up to his \xc5\x9b\xc4\x81kh\xc4\x81, should perform the oblation of ghee\naccording to what is said therein till the \xc4\x81jya portion with those (man\xe1\xb9\xadras\nbeginning with) \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, etc.; he should eat thrice the fried rice-powder, and\nthen sipping the water, he should maintain the fire; then seated north of the\nfire on a deer-skin, he should be engaged in the study of Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as; without\nsleeping, he should bathe at the end of the four y\xc4\x81mas and after cooking the\noblation of (rice) in the fire, he should offer it to the fire in sixteen\noblations according to (the man\xe1\xb9\xadras of) Purusha-S\xc5\xabk\xe1\xb9\xada. Then having done\nviraj\xc4\x81homa and sipped water, he should close it with the gift (to br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as)\nof cloth, golden vessel, and cows along with presents of money and then\ndismiss Brahm\xc4\x81 (who had been invoked). With the prescribed man\xe1\xb9\xadra, he should\nattract Agni (fire) unto\n\np. 150\n\nhimself. After meditating upon and coming round and prostrating before the\nfire, he should dismiss it. Then in the morning performing san\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81 and\nuttering G\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab a thousand times, he should make upa\xe1\xb9\xa3th\xc4\x81na (worship) to the\nsun. Then descending into water up to the navel, he should make arghya (water-\noffering) to the guardians of the eight quarters; then he should give leave to\nG\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab, making S\xc4\x81vi\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab enter into vy\xc4\x81h\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi.\n\nThe man\xe1\xb9\xadra prescribed for this should be uttered through the mind and voice in\nhigh, middling, and low tones. With the man\xe1\xb9\xadra, a  ![](img/15000.jpg) the\nwater should be sipped and having taken the water with the two hands, it\nshould be dropped on the east. Having uttered  ![](img/15001.jpg), he should\npluck his hair (yet left) and uttering the prescribed man\xe1\xb9\xadra and having torn\noff the sacred thread and taken it in the hand with water, should utter\n![](img/15002.jpg): \'go to the ocean\' and cast them down as oblation in\nwater:-- ![](img/15003.jpg) Having uttered thrice and saturated thrice (the\nwater) with (the influence of) the man\xe1\xb9\xadra, he should sip the water; and then\nuttering the man\xe1\xb9\xadras  ![](img/15004.jpg), etc., he should cast aside in water\nthe cloth and waist-cord. Having thought himself to be the abdicator of all\nkarmas, he, being in the meditation of his own Reality as nature made him,\nshould go as before northwards with hands upraised. Should he be a sanny\xc4\x81sin\nlearned (in the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, etc.), he should get himself initiated into Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava\nfrom his teacher and go about at his own free will with the thought of there\nbeing none other but his Self, and feeding his body with fruits, leaves and\nwater, live in mountains, forest and temples. That lover of salvation who\nafter sanny\xc4\x81sa roams about naked in all places with his heart full of the\nenjoyment of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmic bliss, with the fruit of avoidance of karmas and\nmaintaining his life with fruits, juice, barks, leaves, roots and water should\nabandon his body in mountain caves, uttering the Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava. But an aspirant\nafter wisdom, should he become a sanny\xc4\x81sin, should, after walking a hundred\nsteps, be addressed by the teacher and other Br\xc4\x81hmans thus: "O Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81ga (very\nfortunate person), stay,\n\np. 151\n\nstay, wear the staff, cloth and bowl, come to the teacher in order to learn\nthe meaning of Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava man\xe1\xb9\xadra v\xc4\x81kya". He should then take up the waist-cord,\nloin-cloth, red-coloured cloth and bowl. A bamboo staff which is not injured\nfrom top to bottom, equal, beautiful, and not spotted with black, should be\nworn by him, after sipping the water and uttering the man\xe1\xb9\xadra prescribed for\nthe purpose. Then the bowl should be taken up, after uttering the man\xe1\xb9\xadra with\nthe Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava preceding it:-- ![](img/15100.jpg) Then after first uttering (the\nman\xe1\xb9\xadra)  ![](img/15101.jpg) he should take up the waist-cord, loin-cloth and\ncloth with the \xc4\x81chamana (sipping of water) preceding it.\n\n"Thus consecrated with yoga and thinking that he had done all that should be\ndone, he should be firm in the observances of his order of life. Thus is the\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n##### Upa\xe1\xb8\x8de\xc5\x9ba V\n\nThen N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da said to the Grandfather thus:--\n\n"You said that sanny\xc4\x81sa was the liberator of all karmas. Now you say again\nthat the sanny\xc4\x81sin is one that should be in the observance of his \xc4\x81\xc5\x9brama\n(order of life). (How to reconcile the two?)" To which the Grandfather replied\nthus: "To the j\xc4\xabva possessing the body, there are three avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81s--the waking,\nthe dreaming, and the dreamless sleeping with \xe1\xb9\xadurya (the fourth). Those beings\nof Purushas that are subject to these avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81s follow the observances,\nincidental to them, of karma, j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and vair\xc4\x81gya." N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da said: "O Lord, if\nso, what are the differences of different orders of sanny\xc4\x81sa? And what are the\ndifferences of their observances? Please tell us truly."\n\nTherefore the differences of sanny\xc4\x81sas, and the differences of observances\nwere related for the sake of N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da by Brahm\xc4\x81, after assenting to his\n(N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da\'s) question thus:--\n\n"Truly sanny\xc4\x81sa is of one kind only. On account of aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, inability and non-\nperformance of karmas (of persons), it is divided into three and then into\nfour, thus: vair\xc4\x81gya-sanny\xc4\x81sa, j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na-sanny\xc4\x81sa, j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81navair\xc4\x81gya-sanny\xc4\x81sa and\nkarma-sanny\xc4\x81sa.\n\np. 152\n\n[paragraph continues] The vair\xc4\x81gya-sanny\xc4\x81sin is one who becomes an ascetic\nafter being in a vicious condition of lust, etc., and then, becomes disgusted\nwith the objects through his former good karmas. A j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na-sanny\xc4\x81sin is one who\nbecomes an ascetic with the four means of salvation, after controlling the\norgans through book-wisdom, and becoming familiar with the experiences of the\nworld of virtue and vice, after abandoning anger, jealousy, envy, aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra and\nall sanny\xc4\x81sa productive of identification, after giving up the three v\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s\nof the body, books and world, which are of the form of desires for women,\nwealth and earth, and after thinking that the whole of the universe should be\ngiven up, like vomited food. A j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81navair\xc4\x81gya-[sanny\xc4\x81sin](errata.htm#10) is one\nwho becomes an ascetic as nature made him, after practising and enjoying all,\nand having the body alone remaining, through j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and vair\xc4\x81gya, in the\nrealisation of the Reality. A karma-sanny\xc4\x81sin is one who, though he has no\nvair\xc4\x81gya, becomes an ascetic by regularly passing from one \xc4\x81\xc5\x9brama to another,\nfrom the celibate, to the householder and then to the forester. A vair\xc4\x81gya-\nsanny\xc4\x81sin is one who becomes an ascetic from the celibate order (directly),\nbeing as nature made him.\n\n"(There is another fourfold classification.) The four kinds are: vi\xe1\xb8\x8dva\xe1\xb9\xad-\nsanny\xc4\x81sa, j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na-sanny\xc4\x81sa, vivi\xe1\xb8\x8dish\xc4\x81-sanny\xc4\x81sa and karma-sanny\xc4\x81sa. In karma-\nsanny\xc4\x81sa, there are two (sub-) divisions, nimi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada (causal) and animi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada (non-\ncausal). \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadura-sanny\xc4\x81sa (on account of the cause of approaching death,\ndisease, etc.), is nimi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada-sanny\xc4\x81sa. The krama (regular) sanny\xc4\x81sa is animi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada.\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadura-sanny\xc4\x81sa is on account of defective karmas. When sanny\xc4\x81sa is taken at\nthe time of death, it is called nimi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada. Animi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada is that when one becomes\nduly a sanny\xc4\x81sin when the body is strong, (after being convinced) that all\ncreated things are subject to destruction, that body and others should be\ngiven up, that all \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81s (souls)--each one shining in the pure Ak\xc4\x81s, dwelling\nin all, moving in the an\xe1\xb9\xadariksha (middle world) as of the form of v\xc4\x81yu, in the\nsacrificial pit as of the form of fire, in the moon, in all men, in the\nsupreme angels, in the form of truth, in \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, in the form of the conch,\npearl, fish, etc., in water, in the form of grain, etc., on earth, in the form\nof the\n\np. 153\n\nlimbs of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, in the form of the rivers from the mountains, in the form of\ntruth and the great one--are no other than Brahman and that others are but\nperishable.\n\n"There are six classes of sanny\xc4\x81sins--kut\xc4\xabchaka, bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka, hamsa, paramahamsa,\n\xe1\xb9\xadur\xc4\xaby\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada and ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada. Kut\xc4\xabchaka is one who wears the tuft of hair, holy\nthread, staff, bowl, loin-cloth and tattered cloth, who worships mother,\nfather, and teacher, who has potsherd and sling, who is uttering man\xe1\xb9\xadras, who\ntakes food in one and the same place, who wears, vertically, the white earth\n(on the forehead as sect-mark) and who has a staff. Bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka is one who, like\nkut\xc4\xabchaka, wears the tuft of hair, tattered cloth, etc., as well as the three\n(sect-) marks, but who eats eight morsels of food through getting alms. The\nhamsa is one who wears matted hair and the three vertical sect-marks and eats\nthe alms-food without any limit (as to the morsel) and wears the bare loin-\ncloth only. The paramahamsa is he who is without tuft of hair and holy thread,\nbegs food in one day from five houses, has one loin-cloth, wears one red cloth\nalone and sacred ashes and has given up all. The \xe1\xb9\xadur\xc4\xabya\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada is one who either\nmay take fruits, eating them with his mouth like cows, or if he is an eater of\nfood, may beg food from three houses. The naked man having the body alone has\nthe bodily actions (quiescent), like the dead body. Such an one is the\n\xe1\xb9\xadur\xc4\xaby\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadi\xe1\xb9\xada. The ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada is he who is without any rules, gets his food (in his\nmouth), following the course of the boa constrictor, 1 from all persons except\npersons of ill-repute and outcastes, and is ever engaged in the realisation of\nthe Real. Should the \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadura-sanny\xc4\x81sin be alive (after taking sanny\xc4\x81sa), he\nshould take up regular sanny\xc4\x81sa. The rules to be observed in the case of the\n(three), kut\xc4\xabchaka, bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka and hamsa are the same as for the orders of life\nfrom the celibate to the sanny\xc4\x81sin. For the three, paramahamsa upwards, they\nhave no waist-cord, loin-cloth, cloth, bowl and staff. They may get food from\nall castes and should be as nature made them. Such are the rules.\n\np. 154\n\n"At the time of the sanny\xc4\x81sa, the recitation of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das should be made till\nthe mind is cleared; and after casting aside in water the waist-cord, loin-\ncloth, staff, cloth, bowl, etc., he should roam about. He should be without\neven the slightest tattered cloth. He should neither utter anything other than\nPra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, nor talk nor hear. He should not study logic or grammar. He should\nnot talk many words; they will but pain his vocal organ. He should not\nconverse with people through the vocal organ. He should not talk in other\nlanguage (than Samsk\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad). He has no worship of God and no witnessing of\nfestivals; he should be free from pilgrimage. The other rules of ascetics are:\nThe kut\xc4\xabchaka should beg alms in one house only; for the bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka, eight\nmorsels in eight houses; for the hamsa, there is no limit; for paramahamsa, he\nshould beg with his hand as the vessel in five houses; for the \xe1\xb9\xadur\xc4\xaby\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadi\xe1\xb9\xada, he\nshould eat fruits with his mouth like cows; (for ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada), he should take\nfood like a boa constrictor in all castes. The ascetic should not dwell in one\nplace for many days. He should not make prostrations to any one. Among the\n\xe1\xb9\xadur\xc4\xaby\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadi\xe1\xb9\xada and ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada (ascetics), even though one is junior, he should not\nmake prostrations to another, a senior who has known the Reality. He should\nnot swim with his hands and cross the river. He should not climb up a tree,\nnor get into a carriage. Nothing should be purchased or sold (by him). No\nexchange should be made, no ostentation for him. There is nothing for the\nascetic to do. If there is anything for him to do, he will perish. Therefore\nthe only thing he is qualified to do is reflection, etc.\n\n"To the \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xaduras and kut\xc4\xabchakas, the world they attain is bh\xc5\xabrloka and\nbhuvarloka; to the b\xc4\x81h\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8dakas, swargaloka; to the hamsas, \xe1\xb9\xadapoloka; to the\nparamahamsas, sa\xe1\xb9\xadyaloka. To the \xe1\xb9\xadur\xc4\xaby\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada and ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada, Kaivalya in \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81\naccording to the analogy of the wasp and the worm through the realisation of\nReality. It is the command of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das that whatever form one thinks of at\nthe last (death) moment and before leaving the body is attained by him and no\nother. Knowing it thus, he should not be a practiser of anything but the\nrealisation of Reality.\n\np. 155\n\n[paragraph continues] Through the observance of any other, he goes to the\nworld of that other. To one that has attained j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na-vair\xc4\x81gya, his salvation is\nin the Self, as there is no other observance for him. The same one (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81)\nalone is styled Vi\xc5\x9bva in the waking state, \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa in the dreaming state and\nPr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a in the dreamless sleeping state. Through the difference of states,\nthere is the difference of the agent presiding over them. To the fourteen\norgans (the ten organs of sense and actions and the four organs of the mind in\nthese states,) the outer and inner v\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadis (modifications) are the material\ncause. There are four v\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadis, _viz_., manas, bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra and chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada.\nThrough the differences of actions of the v\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadis, there arise the differences\nof separate functions. When (the presiding agent is) in the eyes, there is the\nwaking state; in the throat, the dreaming state; in the heart, the dreamless\nsleeping state; and in the head, the \xe1\xb9\xadurya (or fourth) state. Knowing these\nand that the \xe1\xb9\xadurya is the indestructible, one should not hear or see anything\nin the waking state, as if he were in dreamless sleeping state, To such a one\nwho does not apparently know them, even the dreaming state forms the same\n(dreamless sleeping) state. Such a one is termed J\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada. All the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das say\nthat there is salvation to such a one.\n\n"To the ascetic, there should be no desire of this world or the higher. Then\nhe will be one that will practise accordingly. Through the practices of (the\nstudy of) books foreign to the realisation of Reality, he becomes a useless\nperson like a camel bearing saffron paint. To him, there is no entry into yoga\nbooks, no study of s\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85khya books, no practise of man\xe1\xb9\xadra or \xe1\xb9\xadan\xe1\xb9\xadra. Should\nthere be any entry into other books (than the one treating of Reality), then\nit will be like an ornament to a dead body. Like a cobbler, he should be\nbeyond karma and knowledge and unfit for salutation and repeating the names of\nthe Lord. He will duly get the benefit of the karmas (of his order of life).\nHaving given up all like the foam (separating itself) from the castor oil,\nhaving the mental staff which controls the mind clinging to objects, having\nthe hand as the vessel (for eating) and having the quarters alone as the\ncloth, the ascetic\n\np. 156\n\nshould go about like a lad, idiot, or ghost. He should neither desire to live\nnor die. Like a coolie abiding his appointed time (of pay), the ascetic should\nbide his time (of death). One who lives by taking alms without (the\nqualifications of) patience, wisdom, vair\xc4\x81gya and the qualifications beginning\nwith \xc5\x9bama (control of mind) is the spoiler of the order of life of an ascetic.\nThere is no salvation obtained through the mere assumption of the staff or\nmaking the head bald or other disguise or through ostentatious observances.\nThat man who has j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na as his staff is said to be the \xc4\x93ka\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\x87d\xc4\xab (one having\nBrahman alone as the staff). An ascetic who, having merely a wooden staff\nwithout j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, eats all (indiscriminately) in all places, goes to the terrible\nhells called Mah\xc4\x81raurava. (The sense of) greatness in his case is likened by\nthe \xe1\xb9\x9bshis to the pig\'s dung. Having given it up, he should move about like a\nworm. Food and cloth without being begged for by him should be obtained\ninvoluntarily through the will of others. A naked (ascetic) may bathe at the\nwish of another. A man who practises [the](errata.htm#11) meditation upon Self\nin the dreaming state as in the waking is said to be the foremost and first of\nBrahmav\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dins. He should neither grieve for things not obtained, nor rejoice at\nthings obtained. With the organs not attached to objects, he should be engaged\nin the sole protection of life. He should always look down upon the gains\nobtained with much respect (shown to him). Through the gains obtained with\nmuch respect, the ascetic though released becomes bound. What is meant by the\nprotection of life, is this: When the fire (of the hearth in a house) had been\nextinguished and all have taken food, he may go to the houses of caste people\nthat are fit for taking alms from. The yogin who has his hand only as his\nalms-bowl should not often take alms. He may take (food) standing or sitting;\nso in the middle (of taking food), he may sip water. Those who have pure mind\nshould not over-step the limits like the ocean. The great ones do not give up\ntheir self-restraint like the sun. When the muni takes, like a cow, the food\nwith the mouth only (without the use of the hand), he becomes of equal vision\nto all beings. Then\n\np. 157\n\nhe becomes fit for salvation. He may, for alms, go from a forbidden house to a\nnon-forbidden one. He should go (for alms) to a house where the door is ajar,\nbut not to a house where it is closed. The muni who has a dusty body, an\nuninhabited house or the foot of a tree as his abode, without anything dear or\nnot dear to him, sleeping where the sun sets, without any fire-warship,\nwithout any settled place and with patience and the organs under control,\nshould live without any desire in any place obtained. He who after going to\nthe forest dwells with j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na as the sacrifice and the organs under his mastery\nand awaits his time (of death), is fit to be of the nature of Brahman. A muni\nwho goes about with no cause for instilling fear into all beings need never\nhave any fear from them. One without any abhim\xc4\x81na (identification with body)\nor egoism or dualities or doubt, never is angry, never hates, never lies\nthrough the vocal organ. That person who, having visited all sacred places,\ndoes not do any injury to any living creature and gets alms at the proper\ntime, is fit to be of the nature of Brahman. He should not associate with a\nforester or householder. He should conduct himself in such manner as not to be\nknown to others. He should not be glad of anything. He should roam about on\nearth like a worm, according to the direction pointed out by the sun. He\nshould not do or cause to do works tending to (his) fame or pains or people\'s\nbenefit. He should not be inclined towards vicious books. He should not live\ndependent upon any. He should give up all over-disputatious reasoning. He\nshould not join any party (fighting with another). He should not take any\ndisciples. He should not study many books. He should not discourse. Neither\nshould he commence any works. Without any distinguishing characteristics and\nwithout letting others know his opinions, that wise man, or muni, ever intent\nupon the Br\xc4\x81hmic vision, should exhibit himself to people like an idiot, or a\nlad, or a mute person. He should neither do nor talk anything. He should not\nthink of a good or bad thing. Rejoicing in That within himself, the muni\nshould go about like an idiot. He should roam about alone without associating\nwith any, and\n\np. 158\n\nwith the senses under control. The clever j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab sporting in \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, ever\ndelighting in \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, looking upon all with equal vision like an \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma-j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab, and\nplaying like a child, should wander about like an idiot. That learned man\nversed in Brahma-vi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 should talk like a madman. He should follow the\nobservances of cows (by eating with the mouth, causing no trouble to anybody).\nA good j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab whether pushed, disregarded, slighted, beaten, or hindered by the\nvicious, or burnt by their acts, or having urine and faeces thrown upon him by\nthem, or afflicted in various other ways, should always think well of them\nthough pained, and thus make them lift themselves through their own Selves. A\nyogin whether praised or afflicted by others, never thinks of it in order to\nreach a superior state in yoga. A yogin who is slighted by people, attains a\nhigher state in yoga. A yogin never goes against the actions of the virtuous.\nHe is the same whether people slight him or do not desire his association. He\nshould do all that is right through the actions of mind, speech and body to\nall beings born out of the embryo or the egg, etc. He should harbour no malice\nagainst any and give up all clinging to things. The ascetic after giving up\npassion, anger, pride, desire, delusion and other faults should be without\nfear. Eating alms-food, preserving silence, \xe1\xb9\xadapas, special meditation, a good\nj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, and vair\xc4\x81gya--these are said, in the opinion (of the great), to be the\n\xe1\xb8\x8dharma of the ascetic. Wearing the red cloth, and being ever in \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na-yoga,\nhe should live either at the foot of a tree, outside the village, or in the\ntemple. Daily he should live upon begging. He should not eat one food alone\n(from one only). Till the mind becomes pure, the learned man should thus be\nmoving about. Then when the mind is purified, he may be anywhere as a\nparivr\xc4\x81jaka. Seeing Jan\xc4\x81rda\xe1\xb9\x87a in and out everywhere, preserving silence, being\nwithout stain like v\xc4\x81yu, roaming everywhere, being equal in happiness and\npains, and with patience, eating whatever comes to hand, equally regarding\nwithout any hate br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a, cow, horse, beasts and others, meditating through\nthe mind upon Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u that is Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara, thinking ever of Br\xc4\x81hmic\n\np. 159\n\nbliss and thinking himself to be Brahman alone--such a one having known thus,\nregarding the staff to be no other than the certitude of the mind as above,\nhaving no desire, being naked and having abandoned all sams\xc4\x81ra through the\nactions ever done through the mind, speech, and body, attains salvation,\naccording to the analogy of the wasp and the worm, through the practice of the\nrealisation of Reality without ever seeing the universe. Such is the\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n##### Upa\xe1\xb8\x8de\xc5\x9ba VI\n\nN\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da addressing Brahma asked: "O Lord! You said of abhy\xc4\x81sa (practice)\naccording to the analogy of wasp and the worm. What is that practice?"\n\nTo which the Grandfather replied thus:--\n\n"One ( _viz_., an ascetic) should live with true speech and j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na-vair\xc4\x81gya and\nwith the body alone as the remaining (possession). Know j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na alone as the\nbody, vair\xc4\x81gya alone as pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, \xc5\x9b\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadi (mental control) and \xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadi (bodily\ncontrol) as the eyes, manas alone as the face, bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi alone as kal\xc4\x81 (parts of\neffulgence), the twenty-five \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas as the limbs, the avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81s as the five\ngreat elements, karma, bhak\xe1\xb9\xadi, j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, and vair\xc4\x81gya as the branches (or parts)\nand that the waking, dreaming, dreamless sleeping, and \xe1\xb9\xadurya avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81s and the\nfourteen organs as being of the nature of a pillar planted in the mud. Though\nsuch is the case, the man who masters these through his bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi like a boatman\nregarding the boat immersed in the mire, or the elephant-driver regarding the\nelephant (under his control), and has known that all else beside Self is\nillusory and destructible and become indifferent, should ever utter: \'I am\nBrahman alone.\' He should not know anything as other than Self. A Jivanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada\nwho lives thus is a doer of that which should be done. He should not discourse\nthat he is other than Brahman. But he should ever be discoursing: \'I am\nBrahman\'. From the waking, dreaming and dreamless sleeping states, he should\nreach the \xe1\xb9\xadurya state and then \xe1\xb9\xadury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada (the state beyond \xe1\xb9\xadurya). The waking\nstate is in the day; the dreaming in the night and the\n\np. 160\n\ndreamless sleeping in tie midnight. Each avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81 (or state) has its sub-\nstates. The functions of the fourteen organs, eye and others mutually\ndependent are the following: The eyes perceive forms; the ears, sounds; the\ntongue perceives tastes; the nose, odours; the vocal organ speaks; the hand\nlifts; the leg walks; the anus excretes; the sexual organ enjoys; the skin\nfeels; the bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi perceives objects, being under the control of the organs;\nthrough bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, he understands; through chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, he thinks; through aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra,\nhe says I\'. All these should be abandoned. Through the identification with the\nhouse (the body), he, like a householder, becomes a j\xc4\xabva thinking that the\nbody is itself.\n\n"The j\xc4\xabva is dwelling in this body. When he is in the eastern petal (of the\nheart), he inclined to virtuous actions; in the south-eastern petal, to sleep\nand laziness; in the southern petal, to cruel actions; in the south-western\npetal, to sinful actions; in the western petal, to love of sport (or to\nflirt); in the north-western petal, to travelling; in the northern petal, to\npeace of mind; in the north-eastern petal, to j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na; in (the middle of) the\npericarp, to vair\xc4\x81gya; in the filament, to \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81-deliberation. Such are the\ndifferent aspects to be understood (in the heart). The first living avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81\n(of j\xc4\xabva) is the waking; the second is the dreaming; the third is the\ndreamless sleeping; the fourth \xe1\xb9\xadurya; that which is not these four is\ntury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada. The one Lord alone that is witness and without qualities appears\n(as many) through the differences of Vi\xc5\x9bva, \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa, Pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a, and \xe1\xb9\xacatas\xe1\xb9\xadha (the\nneutral). One should (always) utter: \'I am Brahman alone.\' Else in the waking\nstate, (he is) in the four states of the waking state and others: 1 in the\ndreaming state, (he is) in the four states of the dreaming state and others;\nin the dreamless sleeping state, (he is) in the four states of the dreamless\nsleeping and others; in the \xe1\xb9\xadurya, (he is) in the four states of \xe1\xb9\xadurya and\nothers; to the tury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada that is nirgu\xe1\xb9\x87a, such states are not. There is only\none witness in all the states of Vi\xc5\x9bva, \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa and Pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a, who is presiding\nover the gross, the subtle and the causal\n\np. 161\n\n[paragraph continues] (bodies). Is \xe1\xb9\xacatas\xe1\xb9\xadha the seer? or is he not? As (to\n\xe1\xb9\xacatas\xe1\xb9\xadha), there is the property of seeing; the j\xc4\xabva that is affected by the\negoism, etc., of agency and enjoyment is not the seer. The one other than j\xc4\xabva\n( _viz_., \xe1\xb9\xacatas\xe1\xb9\xadha) is not concerned (with egoism, etc.). If it is said that\nthe j\xc4\xabva is not so (concerned with egoism), then it is not a fact. Through the\nabhim\xc4\x81na of the j\xc4\xabva, there is the abhim\xc4\x81na of the body. And (conversely)\nthrough the abhim\xc4\x81na of the body, there is the abhim\xc4\x81na of the j\xc4\xabva. The state\nof the j\xc4\xabva is as a screen (to screen Brahman) like (the pot and house in) the\npot-\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b and the house-\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. Through such a screen, he reaches self-\nrealisation through the man\xe1\xb9\xadra--\'Hamsa-So\'ham\' 1 having the characteristics of\ninspiration and expiration. Having known thus, if he should give up the\nidentification with the body, then he does not identify himself with the body\n( _i.e._ , not attain the state of j\xc4\xabva). Such a one is stated to be Brahman.\nHaving given up abhim\xc4\x81na and anger, being content with moderate food, having\nconquered the organs and having controlled the avenues (of the organs), one\nshould make the mind enter into meditation. The yogin who has always\ncontrolled (his mind and organs) should ever diligently commence his\nmeditation in empty places, caves and forests. The knower of yoga who is bent\nupon accomplishing the end should never be engaged in giving feasts to\nBr\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as, in \xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha sacrifices, etc., or in going to places of pilgrimages,\nfestivals or crowds. The well-controlled yogin should go about as if people\nhad treated him with disrespect. He should not go against the actions of the\nwise. That great ascetic is said to be a \xe1\xb9\xadri\xe1\xb8\x8dan\xe1\xb8\x8din (or having a three-knotted\nstaff) who holds firmly the three-\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\x87da (control) of mind, speech, and body.\nThat ascetic is said to be a supreme person who begs alms-food of worthy\nbr\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as, when smoke has ceased and fire has been extinguished (in their\nhouses). Is he not a degraded ascetic who, though holding the staff and\nbegging food, is without vair\xc4\x81gya and is not intent upon the observances of\nhis order? He is an ascetic--not any other--who does\n\np. 162\n\nnot go to the house where he expects to find special alms or which he already\nvisited. He is said to transcend all castes and orders of life who realises\nthe self-shining supreme \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva that is without body and organs, the all-\nwitness, the real vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na that is of the form of bliss. To the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 that is of\nthe nature of j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, such an idea as: \'the order of life, etc., is mine,\'\nbeing generated out of m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 in this body, can never exist. He who knows thus\nthrough ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada is beyond all castes and orders of life. He from whom all\ncastes and orders of life slip away through \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmic vision, transcends them all\nand remains in \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 alone. That person is said by knower of the meaning of the\nVe\xe1\xb8\x8das to be a\xe1\xb9\xadivar\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81\xc5\x9bram\xc4\xab (beyond caste and order of life) who after crossing\nall castes and orders of life abides in \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 alone. Therefore, O N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da, the\ncastes and orders of life which are foreign (to \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) are attributed falsely,\nby the ignorant, to \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. O N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da, for those that are Brahma-j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xabs, there\nare no rules ordained nor prohibited; there is nothing to be given up or not;\nsimilarly nothing else (for them). Having attained indifference to all objects\neven up to Brahm\xc4\x81\'s seat, having destroyed (or done away with) all fondness\nfor everything, as for son, relatives, wife, etc., and having faith in the\npath of salvation, and through love of ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada-j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, he should approach a\nguru who is a knower of Brahman with gift (in his hand). Having an\nequilibrated mind, he should satisfy the guru for a long time through service,\netc., and learn with a steady firm mind the meaning of the sentences of the\nVe\xe1\xb8\x8das. Then being devoid of \'I\' and \'mine\' and of all attractions, and having\nattained peace of mind, etc., he sees \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 in himself. Through observing the\nfaults of sams\xc4\x81ra, there arises indifference. There is no doubt that sanny\xc4\x81sa\narises in one who becomes disgusted with sams\xc4\x81ra. The aspirant after salvation\nwho is called paramahamsa should, through the hearing, etc., of ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada,\npractise Brahma-j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, which is the direct and chief means of salvation. In\norder to attain Brahma-j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, the one named paramahamsa should possess the\nqualities of the control of mind and body, etc. He should always he a\npractiser of ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada, being master of the mind, the body\n\np. 163\n\nand the organs, being without fear and egoism, with a firm mind, without the\npairs (of opposites), without attaching himself to any, having a worn-out\nloin-cloth, and being bald-headed or naked. He should have the great\nintelligence of the knower of ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada, a yogin without \'I\' and \'mine\' and\nbeing equal and friendly to friends and other beings. That j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab alone and\nnone else is able to cross sams\xc4\x81ra who has his mind at peace. With the grace\nof the guru towards him, he should live with him for one year. He should be\ncareful to observe yama (restraint) and niyama (religious observance). At the\nend of that (year), he should attain the supreme j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na-yoga, and roam about on\nthis earth without going against \xe1\xb8\x8dharma; (or) at the end of one year, he\nshould give up the three orders of life and attain the chief \xc4\x81\xc5\x9brama (of\nsanny\xc4\x81sa), as well as the supreme j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na-yoga. Then, taking leave of the guru,\nhe should wander over the earth, having given up association (with wife, etc.,\nas well as anger, and being content with moderate food and having controlled\nthe senses. The householder who does not perform karma, and the ascetic who\nperforms karma--both become fallen through their perverse doings. Each becomes\nintoxicated through seeing women. Each becomes intoxicated through drinking\nalcohol. Therefore women, mere sight of whom is poison, should be shunned at a\ndistance. Such things as conversation and proximity with, and sight of, women,\ndancing, singing, using violence against persons, and disputatious arguments\nshould be given up. Therefore, O N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da, to such a one, there is neither bath\nnor muttering of man\xe1\xb9\xadras nor worship nor homa, nor means of accomplishment,\nnor any karma of fire-sacrifice, etc., nor worshipping with flowers, etc., nor\nkarmas to the pi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\x9bs nor pilgrimages, nor religious observances, nor \xe1\xb8\x8dharmas,\nnor a\xe1\xb8\x8dharmas, nor any rules of observance, nor any other worldly karmas. He\nshould give up all karmas and worldly observances. That yogin of an ascetic\nwho is a learned person, having his intelligence directed towards Reality,\nshould never injure any worm or insect, bird or tree. O N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da, roam through\nthe world with vision ever directed inwards, with purity, with mind under\ncontrol, with a mind that is full of Brahman\n\np. 164\n\nand all attraction given up within. The muni that goes about alone, does (or\nshould) not dwell in countries where there is no king. (In his case), there is\nneither praise nor prostration, nor the propitiation of \xe1\xb8\x8devas or pi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\x9bs. Thus\nthe ascetic who has his abode changeful (in body), or changeless (in \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81),\nshould be content with whatever he gets. Thus is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n##### Upa\xe1\xb8\x8de\xc5\x9ba VII\n\nThe Grandfather, after eulogizing N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da who asked about the observance of\nascetics, replied thus:--\n\n"The ascetic that has attained indifference (to objects), should stay in one\nand the same place in the rainy season (for four months), and then for (the\nremaining) eight months should wander alone. Then also the ascetic should not\nstay in one and the same place for more than a day. Like a deer that does not\nstay in one place on account of fear, he should not stay in one place. He\nshould not create an attraction (in his mind) that may serve as an obstacle to\nhis going about. He should not cross a stream (by swimming) with his hand, nor\nascend a tree, nor witness the festival of a God, nor partake of regal food,\nnor do the external worship of God. Having discarded all things other than the\nSelf, he should be with his body emaciated by taking food (from each house)\nlike the bees (from each flower). He should not increase the fat (in the\nbody); he should discard ghee like blood. Regarding such royal food as flesh,\nsandal-coating, etc., as offal, the different tastes as the degraded caste,\nthe cloth as a defiled vessel, the oil-bath as sexual union, the gladdening of\na friend as urine, desires as cow\'s flesh, the country known to him as the\noutcastes\' place, gold and women as cobra or deadly poison, the place of\nassembly as the burning ground, the capital of the town as the hell called\nKumbh\xc4\xabp\xc4\x81ka, and royal food as balls of rice offered to the dead, he should be\nwithout any worship of God other than the Self; and having given up all the\nactions of the world and his own country, and ever thinking of the bliss of\nhis Self like the bliss arising from the discovery of a lost object,\nforgetting his country and the\n\np. 165\n\nfondness for his body, and knowing that his body should be slighted like a\ncarcase, he should dwell away from son, relations and native place, like a\nthief released from prison. Taking whatever comes to him without effort, ever\nintent upon the realisation, through meditation, of Brahma-Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, being\nfreed from all karmas, having burnt up all passion, anger, greed, delusion,\npride, malice, etc., having transcended the three gu\xe1\xb9\x87as, being without the six\nhuman infirmities, 1 without the six changes, 2 speaking the truth and being\nopposed to all savoury things, he should live for one day in a village, five\ndays in a town, five days in a sacred place, and five days in sacred waters.\nWith no settled place of residence and with a firm mind, he should dwell alone\nin mountain caves without uttering falsehood. Two persons should not join\ntogether. Should three join, there is created a village thereby; with four, is\nformed a city. Therefore he should live alone in a village. In it, the ascetic\nshould not give scope to his fourteen organs. Having attained wealth of\nvair\xc4\x81gya through the non-dissipated j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, and having deliberated within\nhimself that there is none other than the Self, he should attain J\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xadi,\nhaving seen the Reality everywhere. Till pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha karma is over, he should\nunderstand the four kinds of svar\xc5\xabpa 3 (in \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvamasi) and should live in the\nrealisation of Reality, till his body falls (a prey to death).\n\n"To the kut\xc4\xabchaka there is (prescribed) a bath three times daily; to the\nbah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka, twice; to the hamsa, once; to the paramahamsa there is the mental\nbath; to the tury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada, there is the holy-ashes bath; to the ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada, there\nis the wind as the bath. For the kut\xc4\xabchaka, there is the vertical sect-mark;\nfor the bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka, there is the three-lined (horizontal) sect-mark; for the\nhamsa, both; for the paramahamsa, there is the holy-ashes sect-mark; for the\n\xe1\xb9\xadury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada, there is the spot-sect-mark; for the\n\np. 166\n\nava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada or for the tury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada and ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada, there is none. For the kut\xc4\xabchaka,\nshaving takes place once in two months; for the bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka, once in four months;\nfor the hamsa and paramahamsa, none, or if wanted, once in a year; for the\ntury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada and ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada, none at all. The kut\xc4\xabchaka should take the food in one\n(place only); the bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka should take alms (in many places); for the hamsa\nand paramahamsa, the hand is the vessel; the tury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada, should take food with\nthe mouth as the cow; for the ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada, it is like the action of the boa\nconstrictor (opening the mouth and taking whatever comes into it). For the\nkut\xc4\xabchaka, there are two cloths; for the bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka, there is one cloth; for the\nhamsa there is a piece of cloth; and the paramahamsa should be naked or have\nonly a loin-cloth; in the case of the tury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada and ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada, they should be\nas nature made them. For the hamsa and paramahamsa, there is (prescribed) a\ndeerskin, and for no others. For the kut\xc4\xabchaka and bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka, there is the\nworship of the divine (image); for the hamsa and paramahamsa, there is mental\nworship; for the tury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada and ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada, there is the idea that they alone are\nBrahman. The kut\xc4\xabchaka and bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka are entitled to man\xe1\xb9\xadras and japas; the\nhamsa and paramahamsa, to \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na (meditation); the tury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada and ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada are\nentitled to none; but they are entitled to the initiation of the sacred\nsentences of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das; so also the paramahamsa. The kut\xc4\xabchaka and bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka\nare not entitled to initiate others; for them, there is (the uttering of) the\nmental pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava; for the hamsa and paramahamsa, there is the internal pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava\n(in the heart); for the tury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada and ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada, there is the Brahma-pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava\n(always). For the kut\xc4\xabchaka and bah\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\x8daka, there is \xc5\x9brava\xe1\xb9\x87a (hearing and\nstudy); for the hamsa and paramahamsa, there is manana (thinking and\nremembering); for the tury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada and ava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada there is ni\xe1\xb8\x8di\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81sana (profound\nmeditation ever). For all these, there is necessarily the meditation upon\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Thus the aspirant after salvation should ever be uttering the Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava\nwhich enables one to cross sams\xc4\x81ra, and be living as a Jivanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada. Thus the\nascetic, according to each one\'s capacity, should ever be seeking the means to\nattain Kaivalya. Such is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\np. 167\n\n##### Upa\xe1\xb8\x8de\xc5\x9ba VIII\n\nThen N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da, asked Parameshth\xc4\xab (Brahm\xc4\x81) to enlighten him, who had surrendered\nhimself to Him, about sams\xc4\x81ra-\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81raka (or that \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81raka or Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava which lifts\none out of sams\xc4\x81ra).\n\nAssenting to which, Brahm\xc4\x81 began thus: "Omk\xc4\x81ra that is Brahman is the vyashti\n(individual) and the samashti (cosmic). What is the individual? What is the\ncosmic? Brahma-pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava is of three kinds, samh\xc4\x81ra- (destructive) pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava,\ns\xe1\xb9\x9bshti- (creative) pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, and ubhay\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadmaka (belonging to both) pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, as\nbeing of two forms, internal and external. (It is also eight:) An\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb8\xa5-pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava,\nVy\xc4\x81vah\xc4\x81rika-pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, b\xc4\x81hya-pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, \xc4\x81rsha-pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, ubhay\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadmaka or vir\xc4\x81t-\npra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, samh\xc4\x81ra-pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, brahma-pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava, and ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava. Om is\nBrahman. Know that the man\xe1\xb9\xadra of the one-syllabled Om is Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava. It has the\neight differences of ak\xc4\x81ra, uk\xc4\x81ra, mak\xc4\x81ra, ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81, n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da, bin\xe1\xb8\x8du, kal\xc4\x81, and\n\xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi. Know it is not four (alone). Ak\xc4\x81ra is associated with ten thousand\nlimbs; uk\xc4\x81ra, with one thousand limbs; mak\xc4\x81ra with one hundred limbs;\nar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 is of the nature of endless limbs. That which is sagu\xe1\xb9\x87a (associated\nwith gu\xe1\xb9\x87as) is vir\xc4\x81t- (preservation) pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava; that which is nirgu\xe1\xb9\x87a (not\nassociated with gu\xe1\xb9\x87as) is samh\xc4\x81ra- (or destruction) pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava; that which is\nassociated with gu\xe1\xb9\x87as and is not so associated, is u\xe1\xb9\xadpa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi- (or origination)\npra\xe1\xb9\x87ava. Plu\xe1\xb9\xada (the elongated accent) is vir\xc4\x81t: plu\xe1\xb9\xadaplu\xe1\xb9\xada is samh\xc4\x81ra. The\nvir\xc4\x81t-pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava is of the form of sixteen m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s and is above the thirty-six\n\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas. The sixteen m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s are thus: Ak\xc4\x81ra is the first m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81; uk\xc4\x81ra is the\nsecond; mak\xc4\x81ra is the third; ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 is the fourth; n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da is the fifth;\nbin\xe1\xb8\x8du is the sixth; kal\xc4\x81 is the seventh; kal\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada is the eighth; \xc5\x9b\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadi is the\nninth; \xc5\x9b\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadya\xe1\xb9\xadi\xe1\xb9\xada is the tenth; unman\xc4\xab is the eleventh; manonman\xc4\xab is the\ntwelfth; pur\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xadi is the thirteenth; \xe1\xb9\xadanuma\xe1\xb8\x8dhyam\xc4\x81 is the fourteenth; pa\xe1\xb9\xadi is\nthe fifteenth; par\xc4\x81 is the sixteenth. Then (again) having sixty-four m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s\nand their division into the two, Prak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi and Purusha and resolving themselves\ninto the one hundred and twenty-eight differences of m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s, it becomes sagu\xe1\xb9\x87a\nand nirgu\xe1\xb9\x87a. Though Brahma-pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava is one only, it is the substratum of all,\nthe support\n\np. 168\n\nof the whole universe, of the form of all aksharas (letters), time, Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, and\n\xc5\x9aiva. This Omk\xc4\x81ra should be sought after, that is mentioned in the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das of\nthe nature of the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds. Know that this Omk\xc4\x81ra is the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 that is\nindestructible during the three periods of time, past, present, and future,\nable to confer salvation and eulogized by Brahma-sound (Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das). Having\nexperienced this one Om as immortal and ageless, and having brought about the\nBrahma-nature in this body, become convinced that your \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, associated with\nthe three bodies, is Parabrahman. Through Vi\xc5\x9bva and others ( _viz_., \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa,\nPr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a, and \xe1\xb9\xacurya) in order, the realisation of Parabrahman should be\nattained, since \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is of four kinds through his identification with, and the\nenjoying of, the gross as well as the enjoyer of the gross, the subtle as well\nas the enjoyer of the subtle, and through his identification (with the third\nbody) enjoying bliss in the fourth. He has four feet. The one presiding over\nthe waking state is gross; and since he is the enjoyer of Vi\xc5\x9bva (the\nuniverse), he becomes the s\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc5\xabla-praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81 (gross consciousness). He has nineteen\n1 facets and eight parts. He is pervading everywhere and the Lord. He is the\nenjoyer of the gross and is the cha\xe1\xb9\xadur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma called Vi\xc5\x9bva. He alone is the\nPurusha called Vai\xc5\x9bv\xc4\x81nara. He alone is Vi\xc5\x9bvaji\xe1\xb9\xad (the conqueror of the\nuniverse). This is the first foot. When this Lord attains the dreaming\ncondition, he is the s\xc5\xabkshma-praj\xc3\xb1a (subtle consciousness). O conqueror of\nall, he is the one having eight limbs, and there is none else. He is the\nenjoyer of the subtle and is cha\xe1\xb9\xadur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma, named \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa and the protector of\nelements. He alone is the Hira\xe1\xb9\x87yagarbha, presiding over the gross (or subtle\nmatter rather). He is said to form the second foot. Sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi (or the dreamless\nsleep) is that state where one sleeps without any desire and where one sees\nnot any dreams. The one identified with this dreamless sleep is Praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na-\nghana, is blissful, of the nature of eternal bliss and the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 in all\ncreatures; yet he is enjoyer of bliss, has che\xe1\xb9\xadas (consciousness) as his (one)\nfoot, is all-pervading, indestructible,\n\np. 169\n\ncha\xe1\xb9\xadur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and the Lord, and is named Pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a, the third foot. He alone is the\nLord of all, the knower of all, the subtle-thoughted, the latent one, and the\ncause of all creation. He alone is the origin and the destruction. These three\n(states) are obstacles to all creatures obtaining (the final) peace. As is\nsvapna, so is sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi, it (also) being said to be illusory. The cha\xe1\xb9\xadur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81,\nthe fourth, as he is Sa\xe1\xb9\xad, Chi\xe1\xb9\xad and \xc4\x92karasa (the one essence), ends as the\nfourth and follows (upon the heels of each of the above states), is the knower\nof the means of vikalpa-j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and is the anuj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81 (the one following knower).\nHaving known them, and known as m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 the three vikalpas of sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi, svapna\nand \xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadara (the inner), even in this state, is he not (to be known as) Sa\xe1\xb9\xad-\nChi\xe1\xb9\xad-\xc4\x92karasa? This shall be expressed as differentiated thus: It is not even\nthe gross praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81; nor is it the very subtle praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81; nor is it praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81 itself\n(of the causal body): O muni neither is it the trifling praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81; nor is it the\nnon-praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81; nor is it the dual praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81; nor is it the internal praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81, though\nit is without praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81; it is Praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na-ghana. It can never be known by the\norgans; nor it can be known by the reason; it cannot be grasped by the organs\nof action. It cannot be proved. It cannot be reached by thought. It cannot be\nproved by analogy. It can be realised by Self-realisation alone. It is with\nthe waking state, etc. It is the auspicious, with changes, without a second.\nSuch a one is thought to be \xe1\xb9\xacurya. This alone is Brahman, Brahma-pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava. This\nshould be known. There is no other \xe1\xb9\xacurya. To the aspirants after salvation, it\nis the support, like the sun everywhere; it is the Self-light. As it alone is\nBrahman, this Brahma-Ak\xc4\x81s is shining always. Thus is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n##### Upa\xe1\xb8\x8de\xc5\x9ba IX\n\nN\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da asked: "Who is Brahma-swar\xc5\xabpa?" To which Brahma replied thus: "Brahma-\nswar\xc5\xabpa is thus: Those who know that \'he (Brahman) is one and I am another\'\nare only pa\xc5\x9bus (animals). The real pa\xc5\x9bus (animals) are no animals. The wise\nman who knows Brahman thus (as himself, and himself\n\np. 170\n\nas Brahman) escapes out of the mouth of death. There is no other path to\nsalvation.\n\n"Is time the cause (of origination of universes)? 1 or nature? or karma? or\naccident? or the (great) elements? or Purusha? This should be considered. It\nis not the union of them. (Then) there is the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, but (j\xc4\xabva-) \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is not\nthe Lord, as it is subject to pleasures and pains. Those (\xe1\xb9\x9ashis) following\n\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na-yoga have beheld, as the cause, the \xe1\xb8\x8dev\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma-\xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi concealed by its own\nqualities of that One that presides over all the causes associated with time\nand \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma. Him (the Universal Soul), we consider as the wheel which has one\ncircumference, which is covered by three (layers), which has sixteen end-\nparts, which has fifty spokes and twenty counter-spokes, which has six times\neight (nails), which has one rope of various forms, which has the threefold\npath, and which has delusion arising from the twofold cause. Him (we worship\nas a river) which has (water) oozing out of the five currents (of organs),\nwhich is terrible and crooked through the five causes (of elements), whose\npra\xe1\xb9\x87as are the five waves, which has bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, etc., as the root cause, which\nhas five whirlpools, which is impelled by the velocity of the five pains,\nwhich has fifty differences (or has the five miseries), and which has the five\nobstacles. In this wheel of Brahman, which is the support of life and the last\nabiding place of all beings, and which is infinite, is whirling deluded the\nj\xc4\xabva, thinking that it is different from the one (Lord) Ordainer. Being\nblessed by Him, he gains salvation through such (a blessing). This is declared\nas Brahman, as the supreme and the indestructible. In it, are the three (the\nenjoyer, the enjoyed and enjoyment). Hence it is the firm abode (of all). The\nknowers of Brahman having known Brahman within (the universe, etc.,) attain\nsam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi in Brahman and are absorbed in Brahman. \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara upholds this universe,\nclosely associated with the destructible and the indestructible, which are\nmanifest and unmanifest; but the not-ruler of (j\xc4\xabva-) \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is bound through\nthe thought of its being the enjoyer; and having known the Lord is freed from\nall\n\np. 171\n\nfetters. Both \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara and j\xc4\xabva are birthless; one (the former; is j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab and the\nother (latter) is aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab. (The goddess of) Brahm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma-\xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadi, is birthless, is\nalone engaged (in this world), on account of the enjoyment of the enjoyers.\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is endless. The universe is His form. He is not the agent. Whoever knows\nthe Brahman that is threefold (as j\xc4\xabva, \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara and the universe) is released\nfrom bondage. It is pra\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81na alone that is destructible. It is \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara that is\nimmortal and indestructible. The one Lord (\xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara) ordains Pra\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81na and\nPurusha.\n\n"The illusion of the universe disappears through meditation on union (or\nabsorption) and sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva-bh\xc4\x81va of Parame\xc5\x9bvara always. Through knowing the Lord,\navi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 and the rest are destroyed. Through the removal of such pains, there is\nfreedom from birth and death. Through the meditation of that Parame\xc5\x9bvara, the\nthird body is acquired after this (physical) body, all wealth is enjoyed, and\nhe attains whatever should be attained. He should know with certitude that all\nthe three things ( _viz_.,) the enjoyer, the enjoyed, and enjoyment are\nnothing but Brahman, and are of the nature of his own Self. There is none but\nIt to be known. All \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadmic knowledge is through \xe1\xb9\xadapas (only). That, Brahman\ncontains in itself all excellence. Having known thus, whoever meditates upon\nthe (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81-) svar\xc5\xabpa, to him where then is grief? Where then is delusion?\nTherefore the Vir\xc4\x81t is the past, present, and future time, and is of\nindestructible nature.\n\n"\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, that is the atom of atoms and the greatest of the greatest, is in the\ncave of the heart of all creatures. One without the thought of objects and\nwithout grief, knows the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 capable of neither increase nor decrease through\nthe grace of \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara or through the non-attraction to the objects of the\nsenses. He (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) walks speedily without legs, lifts objects without hands,\nsees without eyes and hears without ears. He knows all, but none knows Him. He\nis said to be the foremost Mah\xc4\x81-Purusha. Having known \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 that is bodiless in\nthis fleeting body, the great, the all-pervading, the support of all, with\nincomprehensible power, fit to be known through the meaning, etc., of all the\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8ds, the supreme of the supreme, the supreme object fit to be known,\nthe one remaining after all,\n\np. 172\n\nthe all-knowing, the eternal, the foremost of all foremost beings, the\nordainer of all, the one fit to be worshipped by all angels, the one without\nbeginning, end, and middle, without limit or destruction, the cause of Brahma,\nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u, and Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra, the one that has all the universe latent in himself, of the\nnature of the five elements with the expansion of all the quintuplicated\ncreation, without being enveloped by his own limbs of quintuplicated objects,\nsuperior to the supreme, greater than the greatest, of the nature of\neffulgence, the eternal and the auspicious, the undaunted personage never\ngrieves. One who has neither given up vicious actions, nor controlled his\norgans, nor mastered his mind, nor given up longing after fruits of actions\nthough the mind is undisturbed, nor brought his mind to one state (or point),\nwill not attain this \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.\n\n"This (Brahman) is neither internal nor external consciousness; is neither\ngross, nor j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, nor aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na; nor is it the state between the waking and the\ndreaming states. It cannot be cognised by the organs; is not subject to proof;\nis within. He who knows that which is by Itself alone is an emancipated\nperson."\n\nThe Lord Brahma said that he becomes an emancipated person. He who knows\nReality is a Parivr\xc4\x81t. Such a Parivr\xc4\x81t roams about alone. Through fear, he is\nlike a terrified deer. He will not be opposed to going anywhere. Having given\nup all but his body, he will live like a bee, and without considering others\nas foreign to himself; ever meditating upon Reality, he attains liberation in\nhimself. Such a Parivr\xc4\x81t will be without delusion, without action or causing\nothers to act, being absolved from teacher, disciple, books, etc., and having\nabandoned all sams\xc4\x81ra. Such a Parivr\xc4\x81t roams about thus--without wealth, being\nhappy, able to get wealth (if wanted), having crossed j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na as well\nas happiness and grief, being Self-effulgence, being fit to be known by the\nVe\xe1\xb8\x8das, having known all, able to confer si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis and remaining himself as\nBrahman, the Lord. Such a Parivr\xc4\x81t attains the supreme abode of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, from\nwhich a yogin that has gone to it does not return, and where the sun and the\nmoon do not shine. He does not return. Such is Kaivalya. Such is the\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[134:1](tmu23.htm#fr_104) A higher being with the form of a horse but with a\nhuman head.\n\n[134:2](tmu23.htm#fr_105) A higher being with a human form but with the head\nof a horse.\n\n[134:3](tmu23.htm#fr_106) A semidivine serpent with a human face.\n\n[135:1](tmu23.htm#fr_107) The four Brahmacharyas are: (1) G\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab; (2)\nPr\xc4\x81j\xc4\x81pa\xe1\xb9\xadya; (3) Vai\xe1\xb8\x8dika; (4) Naishtika.\n\n[135:2](tmu23.htm#fr_108) The six G\xe1\xb9\x9bhas\xe1\xb9\xadhas are: (1) V\xc4\x81r\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81v\xe1\xb9\x9bt\xe1\xb9\xadi; _viz_.,\nAgriculture; (2) S\xc4\x81linav\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi; (3) Y\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81vara; (4) Ghorasanny\xc4\x81sin; etc.\n\n[135:3](tmu23.htm#fr_109) The four V\xc4\x81napras\xe1\xb9\xadhas are: (1) Au\xe1\xb8\x8dumbara; (2)\nVaikh\xc4\x81nasa; (3) Sampraksh\xc4\x81li; (4) Pour\xe1\xb9\x87ama.\n\n[135:4](tmu23.htm#fr_110) They are Viveka, Vairagya, etc.\n\n[143:1](tmu23.htm#fr_111) A celibate who has completed his first \xc4\x80srama.\n\n[145:1](tmu23.htm#fr_112) Referring to the idea of the worm becoming the wasp,\nwith the latter\'s frequent stinging.\n\n[153:1](tmu23.htm#fr_113) The snake, or boa constrictor, is said to remain in\none place only on account of its huge body, taking any food that may come to\nits mouth as it is lying there.\n\n[160:1](tmu23.htm#fr_114) Probably "others" refer to the subdivisions of the\ndreaming; so also of other states.\n\n[161:1](tmu23.htm#fr_115) With Hamsa, there is the inspiration, and with\nSo\'ham, there is the expiration.\n\n[165:1](tmu23.htm#fr_116) The six human infirmities are hunger, thirst, grief,\ndelusion, dotage, and death.\n\n[165:2](tmu23.htm#fr_117) The six changes are birth, existence, growth,\ntransformation, decrease, and annihilation.\n\n[165:3](tmu23.htm#fr_118) "\xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad" has its two aspects of the word and its\nmeaning which is Nirgu\xe1\xb9\x87a.
