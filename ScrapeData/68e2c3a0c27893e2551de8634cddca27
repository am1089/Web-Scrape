XIX.\n\nDescendants of Puru. Birth of Bharata, the son of Dushyanta: his sons killed:\nadopts Bharadwaja or Vitatha. Hastin, founder of Hastinapur. Sons of\nAjamid\xcc\x81ha, and the races derived from them, as Panchalas, &c. Kripa and Kripi\nfound by \xc5\x9aantanu. Descendants of Riksha, the son of Ajamid\xcc\x81ha. Kurukshetra\nnamed from Kuru. Jarasandha and others, kings of Magadha.\n\nTHE son of Puru was Janamejaya; his son was Prachinvat; his son was Pravira;\nhis son was Manasyu; his son was Bhayada 1; his son was Sudyumna 2; his son\nwas Bahugava 3; his son was Samyati 4; his son was Ahamyati 5; his son was\nRaudra\xc5\x9bwa 6, who had ten sons, Riteyu 7, Kaksheyu, Sthan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ileyu, Ghriteyu,\nJaleyu, Sthaleyu, Santateyu, Dhaneyu, Vaneyu, and Vrateyu 8. The son of Riteyu\nwas Rantinara 9,\n\np. 448\n\nwhose sons were Tansu, Apratiratha, and Dhruva 10. The son of the second of\nthese was Kan\xcc\x81wa, and his son was Medhatithi, from whom the Kan\xcc\x81wayana\nBrahmanas 11 descended. Anila 12 was the son of Tansu, and he had four sons,\nof whom Dushyanta was the elder 13. The son of\n\np. 449\n\n[paragraph continues] Dushyanta was the emperor Bharata; a verse explanatory\nof his name is chaunted by the gods; "The mother is only the receptacle; it is\nthe father by whom a son is begotten. Cherish thy son, Dushyanta; treat not\n\xc5\x9aakuntala with disrespect. Sons, who are born from the paternal loins, rescue\ntheir progenitors from the infernal regions. Thou art the parent of this boy;\n\xc5\x9aakuntala has spoken truth." From the expression \'cherish,\' Bharaswa, the\nprince was called Bharata 14.\n\nBharata had by different wives nine sons, but they were put to death by their\nown mothers, because Bharata remarked that they bore no resemblance to him,\nand the women were afraid that he would therefore desert them. The birth of\nhis sons being thus unavailing, Bharata sacrificed to the Maruts, and they\ngave him Bharadwaja, the son of Vrihaspati by Mamata the wife of Utathya,\nexpelled by the kick of Dirghatamas, his half brother, before his time. This\nverse explains the purport of his appellation; "\'Silly woman,\' said\nVrihaspati, \'cherish this child of two fathers\' (bhara dwa-jam). \'No,\nVrihaspati,\' replied Mamata, \'do you take care of him.\' So saying, they both\nabandoned him; but from their expressions the boy was called Bharadwaja." He\nwas also termed Vitatha, in allusion to the unprofitable (vitatha) birth of\nthe sons of Bharata 15. The son of Vitatha was\n\np. 450\n\n[paragraph continues] Bhavanmanyu 16; his sons were many, and amongst them the\nchief were Vrihatkshatra, Mahaviryya, Nara, and Garga 17. The son of Nara was\nSankriti; his sons were Ruchiradhi and Rantideva 18. The son of Garga\n\np. 451\n\nwas Sini 19, and their descendants called Gargyas and \xc5\x9aainyas, although\nKshatriyas by birth, became Brahmans 20. The son of Mahaviryya was Urukshaya\n21, who had three sons, Trayyarun\xcc\x81a, Pushkarin, and Kapi 22; the last of whom\nbecame a Brahman. The son of Vrihatkshatra was Suhotra 23, whose son was\nHastin, who founded the city of\n\np. 452\n\n[paragraph continues] Hastinapur 24. The sons of Hastin were Ajamid\xcc\x81ha 25,\nDwimid\xcc\x81ha, and Purumid\xcc\x81ha. One son of Ajamid\xcc\x81ha was Kan\xcc\x81wa, whose son was\nMedhatithi 26; his other son was Vrihadishu, whose son was Vrihadvasu 27; his\nson was Vrihatkarman 28; his son was Jayadratha 29; his son was Vi\xc5\x9bwajit 30;\nhis son was Senajit, whose sons were Ruchira\xc5\x9bwa, Ka\xc5\x9bya, Drid\xcc\x81hadhanush, and\nVasahanu 31. The son of Ruchira\xc5\x9bwa was Prithusena; his son was Para; his son\nwas Nipa; he had a hundred sons, of whom Samara, the principal, was the ruler\nof Kampilya 32. Samara had three sons, Para, Sampara, Sada\xc5\x9bwa. The son of Para\nwas Prithu; his son was Sukriti; his son was Vibhratra 33; his son was Anuha,\nwho married Kritwi, the daughter of \xc5\x9auka (the son of Vyasa), and had by her\nBrahmadatta 34;\n\np. 453\n\nhis son was Vi\xc5\x9bwaksena; his son was Udaksena 35; and his son was Bhallat\xcc\x81a 36.\n\nThe son of Dwimid\xcc\x81ha 37 was Yavinara; his son was Dhritimat 38; his son was\nSatyadhriti; his son was Drid\xcc\x81hanemi; his son was Supar\xc5\x9bwa 39; his son was\nSumati; his son was Sannatimat; his son was Krita, to whom Hiran\xcc\x81yanabha\ntaught the philosophy of the Yoga, and he compiled twenty-four Sanhitas (or\ncompendia) for the use of the eastern Brahmans, who study the Sama-veda 40.\nThe son of Krita was Ugrayudha, by whose prowess the Nipa race of Kshatriyas\nwas destroyed 41; his son was Kshemya; his son was Suvira; his son was\nNripanjaya 42; his son was Bahuratha. These were all called Pauravas.\n\nAjamid\xcc\x81ha had a wife called Nilini, and by her he had a son named Nila; his\nson was \xc5\x9aanti; his son was \xc5\x9au\xc5\x9banti; his son was Purujanu 43; his son was\nChakshu 44; his son was Haryya\xc5\x9bwa 45, who had five sons,\n\np. 454\n\n[paragraph continues] Mudgala, \xc5\x9arinjaya 46, Vrihadishu, Pravira 47, and\nKampilya 48. Their father said, "These my five (pancha) sons are able (alam)\nto protect the countries;" and hence they were termed the Panchalas 49. From\nMudgala descended the Maudgalya Brahmans 50: he had also a son named Bahwa\xc5\x9bwa\n51, who had two children, twins, a son and daughter, Divodasa and Ahalya. The\nson of \xc5\x9aaradwat or Gautama by Ahalya was \xc5\x9aatananda 52; his son was\nSatyadhriti, who was a proficient in military science. Being enamoured of the\nnymph Urva\xc5\x9bi, Satyadhriti was the parent of two children, a boy and a girl.\n\xc5\x9aantanu, a Raja, whilst hunting, found these children exposed in a clump of\nlong \xc5\x9aara grass; and, compassionating their condition, took them, and brought\nthem up. As they were nurtured through pity (kripa), they were called Kripa\nand Kripi. The latter became the wife of Dron\xcc\x81a, and the mother of\nAswatthaman.\n\nThe son of Divodasa was Mitrayu 53; his son was Chyavana; his son\n\np. 455\n\nwas Sudasa; his son was Saudasa, also called Sahadeva; his son was Somaka; he\nhad a hundred sons, of whom Jantu was the eldest, and Prishata the youngest.\nThe son of Prishata was Drupada; his son was Dhrisht\xcc\x81adyumna; his son was\nDrisht\xcc\x81aketu.\n\nAnother son of Ajamid\xcc\x81ha was named Riksha 54; his son was Samvaran\xcc\x81a; his son\nwas Kuru, who gave his name to the holy district Kurukshetra; his sons were\nSudhanush, Jahnu, Parikshit, and many others 55. The son of Sudhanush was\nSuhotra; his son was Chyavana; his son was Kritaka 56; his son was Uparichara\nthe Vasu 57, who had seven children, Vrihadratha, Pratyagra, Ku\xc5\x9bamba, Mavella,\nMatsya, and others. The son of Vrihadratha was Ku\xc5\x9bagra; his son was Rishabha\n58; his son was Pushpavat; his son was Satyadhrita 59; his son was Sudhanwan;\nand his son was Jantu. Vrihadratha had another son, who being born in two\n\np. 456\n\nparts, which were put together (sandhita) by a female fiend named Jara, he was\ndenominated Jarasandha 60; his son was Sahadeva; his son was Somapi 61; his\nson was Sruta\xc5\x9bravas 62. These were kings of Magadha.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[447:1](vp112.htm#fr_1216) Abhayada: Vayu. Vitamaya: Agni. Vatayudha: Matsya.\nCharupada: Bhagavata. The Mahabharata, \xc3\x81di P., p. 136, 138, has two accounts\nof the descendants of Puru, differing materially in the beginning from each\nother, and from the lists of the Puran\xcc\x81as. In the first, Pravira is made the\nson of Puru; his son is Manasyu, who has three sons, \xc5\x9aakta, Sanhanana, and\nVagmin; and there the line stops. Another son of Puru is Raudra\xc5\x9bwa, whose sons\nare Richeyu and the rest, as in our text; making them the second in descent,\ninstead of the eleventh. In the second list, the son of Puru is Janamejaya,\nwhose successors are Prachinvat, Samyati, Ahamyati, \xc5\x9aarvabhauma, Jayatsena,\nAvachina, Ariha, Mahabhauma, Ayutanayin, Akrodhana, Devatithi, Ariha, Riksha,\nMatinara, who is therefore the fifteenth from Puru, instead of the fourth as\nin the first account, or the twelfth as in the text.\n\n[447:2](vp112.htm#fr_1217) Dhundu: Vayu. \xc5\x9aambhu: Agni. Sudhanwan: Brahma.\n\n[447:3](vp112.htm#fr_1218) Bahuvidha: Agni and Matsya.\n\n[447:4](vp112.htm#fr_1219) Sampati: Agni.\n\n[447:5](vp112.htm#fr_1220) Omitted: Vayu. Bahuvadin: Matsya.\n\n[447:6](vp112.htm#fr_1221) Bhadra\xc5\x9bwa: Matsya.\n\n[447:7](vp112.htm#fr_1222) Rajeyu: Vayu. Richeyu: Agni. They were the sons of\nthe Apsaras Ghritachi: or of Misrake\xc5\x9bi: Mahabharata. The Brahma P. and Hari V.\nhave very unaccountably, and in opposition to all other authorities,\ntransferred the whole of the descendants of Anu to this family; substituting\nfor Anu the second name in our text, Kaksheyu. ([p. 444](vp111.htm#page_444).)\n\n[447:8](vp112.htm#fr_1223) The Vayu names also ten daughters, Rudra, \xc5\x9audra,\nMadra, Subhaga, Amalaja, Tala, Khala, Gopajala, Tamrarasa, and Ratnakuti; and\nadds that they were married to Prabhakara, a Rishi of the race of Atri. The\nBrahma P. and Hari V. have a legend of the birth of Soma, the moon, from him\nand one of these ten; who succeeded to the power and prerogatives of Atri. The\nsons of the other wives were less distinguished, but they formed families\neminent amongst holy Brahmans, called Swastyatreyas.\n\n[447:9](vp112.htm#fr_1224) Atimara or Atibhara: Bhagavata. p. 448 Antinara:\nMatsya. Matinara: Mahabharata, Agni and Brahma. According to the Matsya and\nHari V. (not in the Brahma P.), Gauri, the daughter of this prince, was the\nmother of Mandhatri, of the family of Ikshwaku.\n\n[448:10](vp112.htm#fr_1225) In place of these the Matsya has Amurttirayas and\nNrichandra, and there are several varieties in the nomenclature. In place of\nthe first we have Vasu or Trasu, Vayu; Tansurogha, Agni; Tansurodha, Brahma;\nand Sumati, Bhagavata. Pratiratha is read for the second in the Agni and\nBrahma; and for the third, Suratha, Agni; Subahu, Hari V.\n\n[448:11](vp112.htm#fr_1226) Medhatithi is the author of many hymns in the Rig-\nveda, and we have therefore Brahmans and religious teachers descended from\nKshatriyas.\n\n[448:12](vp112.htm#fr_1227) Malina: Vayu. Raibhya: Bhagavata. Dharmanetra:\nBrahma P. The Hari V. omits him, making sad blundering work of the whole\npassage. Thus the construction is such as to intimate that Tansu or Tansurodha\nhad a wife named Ila, the daughter of Medhatithi; that is, his brother\'s\ngreat-granddaughter: but this, as the commentator observes, is contrary to\ncommon sense, and he would read it therefore, \'The daughter of him who was\nnamed Ilin;\' a Raja so called: but in the Vayu and Matsya we have Ilina, the\ndaughter of Yama, married to Tansu, and mother of Malina or Anila; more\ncorrectly perhaps Ailina. The blunder of the Hari V. therefore arises from the\ncompiler\'s reading Yasya, \'of whom,\' instead of Yamasya, \'Yama.\' It is not an\nerror of transcription, for the metre requires Yasya, and the remark of the\ncommentator proves the correctness of the reading. The name occurs \xc3\x8dlina, the\nson of Tansu, in the Mahabharata, agreeably to the Anuvan\xc5\x9ba \xc5\x9bloka, which is\nthere quoted. \'Saraswati bore Tansu to Matinara, and Tansu begot a son, \xc3\x8dlina,\nby Kalingi.\'\n\n[448:13](vp112.htm#fr_1228) The Vayu, Matsya, and Bhagavata agree with our\ntext in making these the grandsons of Tansu: even the Brahma P. concurs, but\nthe Hari V. makes them his sons, having apparently transformed Tansosuta, the\nson of Tansu, into a synonyme of Tansu, or Tansurodha; as in these parallel\npassages: \'The son of Tansu was the illustrious sage Dharmanetra: Upadanavi\nhad from him four excellent sons.\' Brahma P. \'Tansurodha was a royal sage, the\nillustrious institutor of laws. Upadanavi had four sons from Tansurodha.\' Hari\nV. The commentator explains Dharmanetra to be \'institutor p. 449 of laws.\' We\nhave Upadanavi before, as the daughter of Vrishaparvan the Daitya, married to\nHiran\xcc\x81yaksha. Hamilton (Buchanan) calls her the wife of Sughora. The four sons\nare named in other authorities, with some variations: Dushyanta, Sushyanta or\nRishyanta or Sumanta, Pravira and Anagha or Naya. The Mahabharata enumerates\nfive, Dushyanta, \xc5\x9aura, Bhima, Vasu, and Pravasu, but makes them the sons of\n\xc3\x8dlina and grandsons of Tansu.\n\n[449:14](vp112.htm#fr_1229) These two \xc5\x9alokas are taken from the Mahabharata,\n\xc3\x81di Parvan, p. 112, and are part of the testimony borne by a heavenly\nmessenger to the birth of Bharata. They are repeated in the same book, in the\naccount of the family of Puru, p. 139. They occur, with a slight variation of\nthe order, in other Puran\xcc\x81as, as the Vayu, &c., and shew the greater antiquity\nof the story of \xc5\x9aakuntala, although they do not narrate it. The meaning of the\nname Bharata is differently explained in \xc5\x9aakuntala; he is said to be so called\nfrom supporting\' the world: he is also there named \xc5\x9aarvadamana, \'the conqueror\nof all.\'\n\n[449:15](vp112.htm#fr_1230) The Brahma P. and Hari V., the latter especially,\nappear to have modified this legend, with the view perhaps of reconciling\nthose circumstances which are related of Bharadwaja as a sage with his p. 450\nhistory as a king. Whilst therefore they state that Bharadwaja was brought by\nthe winds to Bharata, they state that he was so brought to perform a\nsacrifice, by which a son was born, whom Bharadwaja also inaugurated. In the\nVayu, Matsya, and Agni, however, the story is much more consistently narrated;\nand Bharadwaja, being abandoned by his natural parent, is brought by the\nwinds, as a child, not as a sage; and being adopted by Bharata, is one and the\nsame with Vitatha, as our text relates. Thus in the Vayu, the Maruts bring to\nBharata, already sacrificing for progeny, Bharadwaja, the son of Vrihaspati;\nand Bharata receiving him, says, "This Bharadwaja shall be Vitatha." The\nMatsya also says, the Maruts in compassion took the child, and being pleased\nwith Bharata\'s worship, gave it to him, and he was named Vitatha. And the Agni\ntells the whole story in one verse: \'Then the son of Vrihaspati, being taken\nby the winds; Bharadwaja was transferred with sacrifice, and was Vitatha.\' The\naccount given in the Bhagavata is to the same purpose. The commentator on the\ntext also makes the matter clear enough: \'The name of Bharadwaja in the\ncondition of son of Bharata was Vitatha.\' It is clear that a new-born infant\ncould not be the officiating priest at a sacrifice for his own adoption,\nwhatever the compiler of the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba may please to assert. From Bharadwaja,\na Brahman by birth, and king by adoption, descended Brahmans and Kshatriyas,\nthe children of two fathers: The Mahabharata, in the \xc3\x81di Parvan, tells the\nstory very simply. In one place, p. 136. v. 3710, it says that Bharata, on the\nbirth of his children proving vain, obtained from Bharadwaja, by great\nsacrifices, a son, Bhumanyu; and in another passage it makes Bhumanyu the son\nof Bharata by Sunanda, daughter of \xc5\x9aarvasena, king of Ka\xc5\x9bi; p. 139. v. 3785.\nThe two are not incompatible.\n\n[450:16](vp112.htm#fr_1231) Manyu: Bhagavata. Suketu: Agni. But the Brahma and\nHari V. omit this and the next generation, and make Suhotra, Anuhotra, Gaya,\nGarga, and Kapila the sons of Vitatha: they then assign to Suhotra two sons,\nKa\xc5\x9bika and Ghritsamati, and identify them and their descendants with the\nprogeny of \xc3\x81yu, who were kings of Ka\xc5\x9bi (see [p. 409](vp101.htm#page_409). n.\n[15](vp101.htm#fn_1083)); a piece of confusion unwarranted by any other\nauthority except the Agni.\n\n[450:17](vp112.htm#fr_1232) Vrihat, Aharya, Nara, Garga: Matsya.\n\n[450:18](vp112.htm#fr_1233) Guruvirya and Trideva: Vayu. The first is called\nGurudhi, Matsya; and Guru, p. 451 Bhagavata: they agree in Rantideva. The\nBhagavata describes the great liberality of this prince, and his practice of\nYoga. According to a legend preserved in the Megha Duta, his sacrifices of\nkine were so numerous, that their blood formed the river Charmanvati, the\nmodern Chambal.\n\n[451:19](vp112.htm#fr_1234) \xc5\x9aivi: Matsya.\n\n[451:20](vp112.htm#fr_1235) The other authorities concur in this statement;\nthus furnishing an additional instance of one caste proceeding from another.\nNo reason is assigned: the commentator says it was from some cause.\n\n[451:21](vp112.htm#fr_1236) Durbhakshaya: Vayu. Urukshat: Matsya.\nDuritakshaya: Bhagavata.\n\n[451:22](vp112.htm#fr_1237) Trayyarun\xcc\x81i, Pushkararun\xcc\x81i, Kavi; all became\nBrahmans: ### Matsya: and there were three chief branches of the Kavyas, or\ndescendants of Kavi; ### Gargas, Sankritis, and Kavyas. Ibid.\n\n[451:23](vp112.htm#fr_1238) In the Mahabharata, Suhotra is the son of\nBhumanyu; and in one place the father of Ajamid\xcc\x81ha, &c., and in another of\nHastin. The Brahma P. in some degree, and the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba in a still greater,\nhave made most extraordinary confusion in the instance of this name. In our\ntext and in all the best authorities we have three Suhotras, perfectly\ndistinct: 1. Suhotra great-grandson of Amavasu, father of Jahnu, and ancestor\nof Viswamitra and the Kau\xc5\x9bikas (see [p. 308](vp085.htm#page_308)); 2. Suhotra\nson of Kshatravriddha, and grandson of Ayus, and progenitor of the race of\nKa\xc5\x9bi kings ([p. 406](vp101.htm#page_406)); and 3. Suhotra the son of\nVrihatkshatra, grandson of Vitatha, and parent of Hastin. In the two\nblundering compilations mentioned, we have, first (Hari V. c. 20), a Suhotra\nson of Vrihatkshatra, of the race of Puru; his descent is not given, but, from\nthe names which follow Suhotra, the dynasty is that of our present text:\nsecondly (Hari V. c. 27), Suhotra son of Kanchana, of the line of Amavasu, and\nfather of Jahnu, &c.: thirdly (Hari V. c. 29), Suhotra the son of\nKshatravriddha, and progenitor of the Ka\xc5\x9bi kings: fourthly (Hari V. 32), we\nhave the first and third of these personages confounded; Suhotra is made the\nson of Vitatha, and progenitor of the Ka\xc5\x9bi kings, the dynasty of whom is\nrepeated; thus connecting them with the line of Puru instead of \xc3\x81yus, in\nopposition to all authority. Again, we have a notable piece of confusion, and\nSuhotra the son of Vitatha is made the father of Vrihat, the father of the\nthree princes who in our text and in the Hari V. (c. 20) are the sons of\nHastin; and amongst whom Ajamid\xcc\x81ha is made the father of Jahnu, and ancestor\nof the Kau\xc5\x9bikas, instead of being, as in c. 27, and as every where else, of\nthe family of Amavasu. The source of all this confusion is obvious. The\ncompilers extracted all the authentic traditions accurately enough, but,\npuzzled by the identity of name, they have also p. 452 mixed the different\naccounts together, and caused very absurd and needless perplexity. It is quite\nclear also that the Hari Vanua does not deserve the pains taken, and taken\nfruitlessly, by Mr. Hamilton and M. Langlois to reduce it to consistency. It\nis of no weight whatever as an authority for the dynasties of kings, although\nit furnishes some particular details, which it has picked up possibly from\nauthentic sources not now available.\n\n[452:24](vp112.htm#fr_1239) It was finally ruined by the encroachments of the\nGanges, but vestiges of it were, at least until lately, to be traced along the\nriver, nearly in a line with Delhi, about sixty miles to the east.\n\n[452:25](vp112.htm#fr_1240) In one place, son of Suhotra; in another, grandson\nof Hastin: Mahabharata.\n\n[452:26](vp112.htm#fr_1241) The copies agree in this reading, yet it can\nscarcely be correct. Kan\xcc\x81wa has already been noticed as the son of\nApratiratha. According to the Bhagavata, the elder son of Ajamid\xcc\x81ha was\nPriyamedhas, from whom a tribe of Brahmans descended. The Matsya has\nVrihaddhanush, and names the wife of Ajamid\xcc\x81ha, Dhumini. It also however,\nalong with the Vayu, makes Kan\xcc\x81wa the son of Ajamid\xcc\x81ha by his wife Kesini.\n\n[452:27](vp112.htm#fr_1242) Vrihaddhanush: Bhagavata.

In the Hari V. is a\ncurious legend of the different transmigrations of Brahmadatta and his six\ncompanions, who were successively as many Brahmans, then foresters, then p.\n453 deer, then water-fowl, then swans, and finally Brahmans again, when with\nthe king they obtained liberation. According to the Bhagavata, Brahmadatta\ncomposed a treatise on the Yoga, a Yoga tantra.\n\n[453:35](vp112.htm#fr_1250) Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81asena: Hari V.\n\n[453:36](vp112.htm#fr_1251) Bhallaka: Vayu.

The Hari V. adds that he was killed by Karn\xcc\x81a.\nThe Matsya names his successor Janamejaya, when the race of the Nipas was\nexterminated by Ugrayudha; as noticed below.\n\n[453:37](vp112.htm#fr_1252) So the Vayu and Bhagavata. The Matsya and Hari V.,\nwith less consistency, derive this family also from Ajamid\xcc\x81ha.\n\n[453:38](vp112.htm#fr_1253) Kritimat: Bhagavata.\n\n[453:39](vp112.htm#fr_1254) Between these two the Vayu inserts Mahat and\nRukmaratha. The Matsya, Sudhanwan, \xc5\x9aarvabhauma, Mahapaurava, and Rukmadhara.\nThe Brahma P., Sudharman, \xc5\x9aarvabhauma, Mahat, and Rukmaratha.\n\n[453:40](vp112.htm#fr_1255) The Bhagavata says he was the author of six\nSanhitas of the Sama-veda. (See p. 282.)\n\n[453:41](vp112.htm#fr_1256) The Hari V. says he killed Nipa, the grandfather\nof Prishata, but it had previously stated that it was the son of Bhallat\xcc\x81a,\nseveral descents after Nipa, who was killed by Ugrayudha: and again (c. 32),\nPrishata, conformably to other authorities, appears as the father of Drupada,\nin the family of \xc5\x9arinjaya. The Hari V. relates the destruction of Ugrayudha by\nBhishma, in consequence of his demanding in marriage the widow of \xc5\x9aantanu:\nafter which, Prishata, it is said, recovered possession of Kampilya.\n\n[453:42](vp112.htm#fr_1257) Puranjaya: Bhagavata.\n\n[453:43](vp112.htm#fr_1258) Purujati: Vayu. Puruja: Bhagavata. The Brahma P.\nand Hari V. omit Nila and \xc5\x9aanti.\n\n[453:44](vp112.htm#fr_1259) Riksha: Vayu. Prithu: Matsya. Arka: Bhagavata.\nOmitted: Brahma.\n\n[453:45](vp112.htm#fr_1260) Bahyaswa: Agni. Bhadra\xc5\x9bwa: Mats. Bharmyaswa:\nBhagavata.\n\n[454:46](vp112.htm#fr_1261) Jaya: Matsya. Sanjaya: Bhagavata.\n\n[454:47](vp112.htm#fr_1262) Yavinara: Agni and Bhagavata. Javinara: Matsya.\n\n[454:48](vp112.htm#fr_1263) Kapila: Mats. Krimila\xc5\x9bwa: Brahma.\n\n[454:49](vp112.htm#fr_1264) Panchala was at first the country north and west\nof Delhi, between the foot of the Himalaya and the Chambal. It was afterwards\ndivided into northern and southern Panchala, separated by the Ganges. Makandi\non the Ganges and Kampilya were the chief cities of the latter; Ahikshetra in\nthe former. The Panchalas, according to the Mahabharata, expelled Samvaran\xcc\x81a\nfrom Hastinapur, but it was recovered by Kuru. The purport of the term\nPanchala is similarly explained in other Puran\xcc\x81as. In the Mahabharata they are\nthe grandsons of Ajamid\xcc\x81ha.\n\n[454:50](vp112.htm#fr_1265) The Matsya says that they, as well as the Kan\xcc\x81was,\nwere all followers or partisans of Angiras: ###. The Hari V. has nearly the\nsame words.\n\n[454:51](vp112.htm#fr_1266) Badhrya\xc5\x9bwa: Vayu. Pancha\xc5\x9bwa: Agni. Bandhya\xc5\x9bwa:\nMatsya. Bharmya: Bhagavata. But there is some indistinctness as to his\ndescent. The Matsya and Hari V. give the son of Mudgala only his patronymic\nMaudgalya. According to the first, his son was Indrasena; and his son,\nBandhya\xc5\x9bwa. The second makes Badhrya\xc5\x9bwa the son of Maudgalya by Indrasena. The\nBhagavata makes Bharmya, the patronymic of Mudgala, the son of Bharmya\xc5\x9bwa, and\nwho is the father of Divodasa and Ahalya: ###. The commentator has, ###.\n\n[454:52](vp112.htm#fr_1267) In the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, \xc5\x9aatananda appears as the family\npriest of Janaka, the father of \xc5\x9aita.\n\n[454:53](vp112.htm#fr_1268) From whom the Maitreya Brahmans were descended:\nHari V. In the Matsya and Agni the son of Mitrayu is called Maitreya (see [p.\n3](vp035.htm#page_3)). The Brahma P. and Hari V. here close the lineage of p.\n455 Divodasa: the Agni adds but one name, Somapi. They then proceed with the\ndescendants of \xc5\x9arinjaya, one of the Panchalas, or Panchadhanush, Somadatta,\nSahadeva, and then as in our text. The Vayu and Bhagavata agree with the\nlatter in making the line continuous from Divodasa. According to the Matsya\nand Brahma P. the race of Ajamid\xcc\x81ha became extinct in the person of Sahadeva,\nbut Ajamid\xcc\x81ha himself was reborn as Somaka, in order to continue his lineage,\nwhich was thence called the Somaka family. It was in the reign of Drupada that\nthe possessions of the Panchalas were divided; Dron\xcc\x81a, assisted by the\nPan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81avas, conquering the country, and ceding the southern portion again to\nDrupada, as related in the Mahabharata. The two princes last named in the list\nfigure in the great war.\n\n[455:54](vp112.htm#fr_1269) The Hari V. gives him two brothers, Dhumravarn\xcc\x81a\nand Sudar\xc5\x9bana. In the Mahabharata one list agrees with the text; the other\ncalls Samvaran\xcc\x81a the son of Ajamid\xcc\x81ha by his wife Riksha.\n\n[455:55](vp112.htm#fr_1270) One other is named in the Bhagavata, Matsya,\nBrahma, and Agni; Animejaya, Arimarddana, and Nishadha\xc5\x9bwa. The Hari V. has\nSudhanwat in place of Jahnu; having also Sudhanush.\n\n[455:56](vp112.htm#fr_1271) Krita: Vayu. Kritayajna: Brahma. Krimi: Matsya.\nKriti: Bhagavata.\n\n[455:57](vp112.htm#fr_1272) The story of Uparichara, or a Vasu who by command\nof Indra became king of Chedi, is told in the Mahabharata, \xc3\x81di Parvan (vol. I.\np. 85). He is there said to have at first five sons, Vrihadratha, king of\nMagadha, Pratyagra, Ku\xc5\x9bamba, also called Manivahana, Mavella, and Yadu, by his\nwife Girika; afterwards he has, by Adrika, an Apsaras condemned to the form of\na fish, Matsya a son, and Satyavati or Kali a daughter: the latter was the\nmother of Vyasa. The same legend is referred to in the accounts of Uparichara\nand his family in the Bhagavata, Matsya, Hari V., &c.\n\n[455:58](vp112.htm#fr_1273) Vrishabha: Matsya.\n\n[455:59](vp112.htm#fr_1274) Satyahita: Vayu. Satyahita: Bhagavata. Satyadhrita\nor Pushya: Matsya.\n\n[456:60](vp112.htm#fr_1275) This story is told in the 16th section of the\nSabha Parvan of the Mahabharata, where also he is called the son of\nVrihadratha. In the Vayu he is the son of Satyahita. The Agni has Satyahita,\nUrjja, Sambhava, Jarasandha; and the Matsya, Satyadhrita, Dhanusha, \xc5\x9aarva,\nSambhava, Jarasandha.\n\n[456:61](vp112.htm#fr_1276) Somadhi: Vayu. Udapi: Agni.
