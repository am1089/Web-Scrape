Vyasa said :-- O King Janamejaya! Thus I have answered all your nice\nqueries; also what Naraya _n_ a spoke to the highsouled Narada is also said by\nme. He who hears this greatly wonderful Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Devi Bhagavatam\ncertainly becomes dear to the Devi and all his actions become fructified with\nsuccess. Now as regards your mental distress, how you prevent any evil falling\nto your late father in his future life, I advise you to do the Yaj\xc3\xb1a in the\nname of Bhagavati; and certainly your father will be saved. And you also\nbetter take the Most Excellent Mantra of the Maha Devi duly, according to\nrules; and your human life will then be crowned with success; (your life will\nbe saved; thus you as well as your father will be saved).\n\n\n\n5-12. Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! Hearing thus, the King asked Vyasa Deva to\ninitiate in the Great Devi Mantra and thus to become his Guru. He was then\ninitiated duly according to rules with the Great Mantra of Bhagavati united\nwith Pra _n_ ava. When the Navaratra period arrived, he called Dhaumya and\nother Brahma _n_ as and performed the Navaratra Vrata so very dear to the\nDevi, according to his state. At this time for the satisfaction of the Devi,\nhe caused this Devi Bhagavata Pura _n_ a to be read by the Brahma _n_ as and\nfed innumerable Brahma _n_ as and Kumaris (virgins) and gave in charity lots\nof things to the poor, orphans, and the Brahmi _n_ boys and thus finished the\nVrata. O Ri _s_ is! Thus completing the Deviyaj\xc3\xb1a, while the King was sitting\non his seat, the fiery Devar _s_ i Narada came there from above playing with\nhis lute. Seeing him there, all on a sudden, the King got up, and paid due\nrespects to him by asking him to take his seat, with other necessary things.\nWhen the Devar _s_ i became relieved of his labour of journey, the King asked\nhim about his welfare and then enquired into the cause of his coming there.\n\n\n\n13-19. O Devar _s_ i! Whence and what for are you now coming? By your arrival\nhere I am become blessed and feel that my Lord has come to me; now what can I\nserve to you; kindly command and oblige. Hearing this, the Devar _s_ i Narada\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O King! Today I saw in the Devaloka a very wonderful event. I wanted\neagerly to inform that to you. Hence I have come here. Your father met with a\nbad turn of fate for his bad action. I saw today he assumed a divine form and\nhe was going on a chariot. The Devas were praising him and the Apsaras were\nencircling him. It seemed he\n\n\n\np. 1190\n\n\n\nwas going in that dress to the Ma _n_ i Dvipa. O King! You performed the\nNavaratra Vrata and read the Devi Bhagavata; it seems, as a result of that,\nyour father has now been rewarded with such a noble and good turn of fate. Now\nyou have become blessed and your actions have borne fruits. You have delivered\nyour father from the hell and so you have become an ornament in your family.\nToday your name and fame have extended to the Devaloka.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n20-30. Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! Hearing these words from the mouth of\nNarada, the King Janamejaya became very much happy and delighted and fell\nprostrate at the feet of Vyasa Deva of glorious deeds and said :-- O Best of\nMunis! By Thy Grace, today I have become blessed. Now what return can I pay to\nThee save bowing down to Thee. I pray that Thou dost shew such favours to me\never and again. O Ri _s_ is! Hearing these words of the King Janamejaya,\nVadaraya _n_ a Veda Vyasa blessed him and spoke to him in sweet words :-- \xc2\x93O\nKing! Now leave all other actions. Read always the Devi Bhagavata and worship\nthe Lotus Feet of S\xc2\x92ri Devi. Leave off all laziness and now perform the Devi\nYaj\xc3\xb1a with great eclat. And you will surely be able to cross this bondage of\nthe world. True there are various Pura _n_ as, the Vi _sn_ u Pura _n_ a, the\nS\xc2\x92iva Pura _n_ a, but those cannot compare with one sixteenth of this Devi\nBhagavatam. In fact, this Pura _n_ a is the Essence of all the Pura _n_ as.\nHow can the other Pura _n_ as be compared with this, wherein is established\nthe Devi Mula Prakriti? Reading this Pura _n_ a from the beginning to the end\nyields the result of reading the Vedas. So the wise persons should try their\nbest to study it always.\xc2\x94 Thus saying to Janamejaya, Veda Vyasa departed. Then\nthe pure minded Dhaumya and the other Brahma _n_ as highly praised the Devi\nBhagavatam and went to their desired places. And the King Janamejaya, on the\nother hand, began to read and hear always the Devi Bhagavatam and spent his\ndays happily in governing his kingdom.\n\n\n\nHere end the Thirteenth Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the description of\nJanamejaya\xc2\x92s Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 14](bk12ch14.htm)\n\n'
