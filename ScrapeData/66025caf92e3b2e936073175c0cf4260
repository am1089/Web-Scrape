Tell me, O Sanjaya! Assembled on Kurukshetra, the centre of religious\nactivity, desirous to fight, what indeed did my people and the Pandavas do? 1\n\np. 2\n\nSanjaya said:\n\n2\\. But then King Duryodhana, having seen the Pandava forces in battle-array,\napproached his teacher Drona, and spoke these words: 2\n\np. 3\n\n3\\. "Behold, O Teacher! this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by the\nson of Drupada, thy gifted pupil. 3\n\np. 4\n\n4-6. "Here (are) heroes, mighty archers, the equals in battle of Bhima and\nArjuna--the great warriors Yuyudhana, Virata, Drupada; the valiant\nDhrishtaketu, Chekitana and the king of Kashi; the best of men, Purujit,\nKunti-Bhoja and Shaivya; the powerful Yudhamanyu, and the brave Uttamaujas,\nthe son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi,--lords of great chariots. 4\n\np. 5\n\n7\\. "Hear also, O Best of the twice-born! the names of those who (are)\ndistinguished amongst ourselves, the leaders of my army. These I relate (to\nyou) for your information. 7\n\n8\\. "Yourself and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa, the victorious in war.\nAsvatthama and Vikarna and Jayadratha, the son of Somadatta. 8\n\np. 6\n\n9\\. "And many other heroes also, well-skilled in fight, and armed with many\nkinds of weapons, are here, determined to lay down their lives for my sake.\n\n10\\. "This our army defended by Bhishma (is) impossible to be counted, but\nthat army of theirs, defended by Bhima (is) easy to number. 10\n\np. 7\n\n11\\. "(Now) do, being stationed in your proper places in the divisions of the\narmy, support Bhishma alone." 11\n\np. 8\n\n12\\. That powerful, oldest of the Kurus, Bhishma the grandsire, in order to\ncheer Duryodhana, now sounded aloud a lion-roar and blew his conch. 12\n\n13\\. Then following Bhishma, conches and kettle-drums, tabors, trumpets and\n\np. 9\n\ncowhorns blared forth suddenly from the Kaurava side and the noise was\ntremendous.\n\n14\\. Then, also, Madhava and Pandava, stationed in their magnificent chariot\nyoked with white horses, blew their divine conches with a furious noise.\n\np. 10\n\n15\\. Hrishikesha blew the Panchajanya, Dhananjaya, the Devadatta, and\nVrikodara, the doer of terrific deeds, his large conch Paundra.\n\n16\\. King Yudhishthira, son of Kunti, blew the conch named Anantavijaya, and\nNakula and Sahadeva, their Sughosha and Manipushpaka.\n\n17\\. The expert bowman, king of Kashi, and the great warrior Shikhandi,\n\np. 11\n\n[paragraph continues] Dhrishtadyumna and Virata and the unconquered Satyaki;\n\n18\\. O Lord of Earth! Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed\nson of Subhadra, all, also blew each his own conch.\n\n19\\. And the terrific noise resounding throughout heaven and earth rent the\nhearts of Dhritarashtra\'s party. 19\n\np. 12\n\n20\\. Then, O Lord of Earth, seeing Dhritarashtra\'s party standing marshalled\nand the shooting about to begin, that Pandava whose ensign was the monkey,\n\np. 13\n\nraising his bow, said the following words to Krishna: 20\n\nArjuna said:\n\n21-22. Place my chariot, O Achyuta! between the two armies that I may see\nthose who stand here prepared for war. On this eve of battle (let me know)\nwith whom I have to fight.\n\np. 14\n\n23\\. For I desire to observe those who are assembled here for fight, wishing\nto please the evil-minded Duryodhana by taking his side on this battle-field.\n23\n\np. 15\n\nSanjaya said:\n\n24-25. Commanded thus by Gudakesha, Hrishikesha, O Bharata, drove that\ngrandest of chariots to a place between the two hosts, facing Bhishma, Drona\nand all the rulers of the earth, and then spoke thus, "Behold, O Partha, all\nthe Kurus gathered together!"\n\n26\\. Then saw Partha stationed there in both the armies, grandfathers,\nfathers-in-law and uncles, brothers and cousins, his own and their sons and\ngrandsons, and\n\np. 16\n\ncomrades, teachers, and other friends as well.\n\n27\\. Then he, the son of Kunti, seeing all those kinsmen stationed in their\nranks, spoke thus sorrowfully, filled with deep compassion.\n\np. 17\n\nArjuna said:\n\n29\\. Seeing, O Krishna, these my kinsmen gathered here, eager for fight, my\nlimbs fail me, and my mouth is parched up. I shiver all over, and my hair\nstands on end. The bow Gandiva slips from my hand, and my skin burns. 29\n\n30\\. Neither, O Keshava, can I stand upright. My mind is in a whirl. And I see\nadverse omens.\n\np. 18\n\n31\\. Neither, O Krishna, do I see any good in killing these my own people in\nbattle. I desire neither victory nor empire, nor yet pleasure.\n\np. 19\n\n32-34. Of what avail is dominion to us, of what avail are pleasures and even\nlife, if these, O Govinda! for whose sake it is desired that empire, enjoyment\nand pleasure should be ours, themselves stand here in battle, having renounced\nlife and wealth--Teachers, uncles, sons and also grandfathers, maternal\nuncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, besides other kinsmen.\n\n35\\. Even though these were to kill me, O slayer of Madhu, I could not wish to\nkill them, not even for the sake of dominion over the three worlds, how much\nless for the sake of the earth!\n\np. 20\n\n36\\. What pleasure indeed could be ours, O Jnanardana, from killing these sons\nof Dhritarashtra? Sin only could take hold of us by the slaying of these\nfelons. 36\n\np. 21\n\n37\\. Therefore ought we not to kill our kindred, the sons of Dhritarashtra.\nFor how could we, O Madhava, gain happiness by the slaying of our own kinsmen?\n\n38-39. Though these, with understanding overpowered by greed, see no evil due\nto decay of families, and no sin in hostility to friends, why should we, O\nJanardana, who see clearly the evil due to\n\np. 22\n\nthe decay of families, not turn away from this sin?\n\n40\\. On the decay of a family the immemorial religious rites of that family\ndie out. On the destruction of spirituality, impiety further overwhelms the\nwhole of the family.\n\n41\\. On the prevalence of impiety, O Krishna, the women of the family become\ncorrupt; and women being corrupted,\n\np. 23\n\nthere arises, O Varshneya, intermingling of castes.\n\n42\\. Admixture of castes, indeed, is for the hell of the family and the\ndestroyers of the family; their ancestors fall, deprived of the offerings of\nrice-ball and water. 42\n\np. 24\n\n43\\. By these misdeeds of the destroyers of the family, bringing about\nconfusion of castes, are the immemorial religious rites of the caste and the\nfamily destroyed.\n\n44\\. We have heard, O Janardana, that inevitable is the dwelling in hell of\nthose men in whose families religious practices have been destroyed.\n\np. 25\n\n45\\. Alas, we are involved in a great sin, in that we are prepared to slay our\nkinsmen, from greed of the pleasures of a kingdom!\n\n46\\. Verily, if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, were to slay me,\nunresisting and unarmed, in the battle, that would be better for me.\n\np. 26\n\nSanjaya said:\n\n47\\. Speaking thus in the midst of the battle-field, Arjuna casting away his\nbow and arrows, sank down on the seat of his chariot, with his mind distressed\nwith sorrow.\n\n\n\nThe end of chapter first, designated _The Grief of Arjuna_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](sbg06.htm#fr_1) True it is that the two parties were gathered together\nfor battle, but was the influence of Kurukshetra, the sacred centre of\nreligious and spiritual activity from of old, barren of any result? Did not p.\n3 the spiritual influence of the spot affect any of the leaders in a way\nunfavourable to the occurrence of the battle? is the purport of\nDhritarashtra\'s question.\n\n[2:2](sbg06.htm#fr_2) Sanjaya\'s reply beginning with "But then" and describing\nDuryodhana\'s action is a plain hint to the old king that his son was afraid.\nFor he went to his teacher (regarded as father) instead of to the commander-\nin-chief, as a child in fright would run to its parents in preference to\nothers.\n\n[3:3](sbg06.htm#fr_3) As a scorpion would sting even that whose protection is\nsought to be free from fear, so did the wicked Duryodhana insult his teacher.\nHis meaning in plain words comes to this: just think of your stupidity in\nteaching the science of fight to the son of Drupada and to those of Pandu.\nThey are now arrayed to kill you!\n\n[4:4](sbg06.htm#fr_4) great-charioted: one who is well-versed in the science\nof war and commands eleven thousand bowmen.\n\n[5:7](sbg06.htm#fr_5) However well-versed in the science of war you might be,\nyou are after all a Brahmana (best of the twice-born) a lover of peace, that\nis to say, a coward. It is therefore natural for you to be afraid of the\nPandava force. But take heart, we too have, great warriors in our ranks--is\nthe veiled meaning of Duryodhana\'s words.\n\n[5:8](sbg06.htm#fr_6) Afraid lest he had said too much Duryodhana is\nflattering Drona, by mentioning the latter before p. 6 even Bhishma and\nqualifying Drona\'s brother-in law with the phrase \'victorious in war,\' a move\nlikely to touch the heart of most mortals.\n\n[6:10](sbg06.htm#fr_7) p. 7 In ancient Indian warfare, one commanding a force\nhad for his main-stay a defender about him, whose position was no less\nimportant. Here are given the names of the chief defenders, and not of the\nchief commanders.\n\nThe verse is often interpreted to mean that Duryodhana considers his army\ninefficient and that of the enemy efficient. But this view seems inapposite to\nthe context.\n\n[7:11](sbg06.htm#fr_8) Since I cannot expect from you any initiative, do what\nyou are told to do,--seems to be Duryodhana\'s intention.\n\n[8:12](sbg06.htm#fr_9) All eyes were turned upon Duryodhana and the\npenetrating intelligence of Bhishma detected his fear; and since Drona took no\nnotice of Duryodhana\'s words, knowing his grandson as he did, he had no\ndifficulty in understanding that the latter had spoken to his teacher in a way\nwhich called forth Drona\'s coldness instead of his enthusiasm. The grandsire\'s\nheart was moved with pity and hence the action on his part described in the\nabove verse. It should here be noted that this action, amounting to a\nchallenge, really began the fight. It was the Kaurava side again which took\nthe aggressor\'s part.\n\n[11:19](sbg06.htm#fr_10) Verses 14-19 are full of hints about the superiority\nof the Pandava party and the consequent p. 12 sure defeat of Dhritarashtra.\nThe figure to which Sanjaya draws the old king\'s attention as first taking up\nBhishma\'s challenge, is described by him as the Lord of Fortune and the\nPandava--the best of the Pandu princes. Note also the details in which the\nchariot, horses and conches of the Pandava party are described, and finally\nthough the army of the Kauravas was more than a third as much again as that of\nthe Pandavas, the noise made by the former was only tremendous, whereas that\nof the latter was not only tremendous but filled the earth and sky with\nreverberations and rent the hearts of the former.\n\n[13:20](sbg06.htm#fr_11) In view of the sudden change of feeling that is to\ncome over Arjuna it should be noted how full of the war-spirit we find him in\nthis verse.\n\n[14:23](sbg06.htm#fr_12) Arjuna is impatient to see who dared face him in\nfight!\n\n[17:29](sbg06.htm#fr_13) Compassion overpowered him. Not that it was due to\ndiscrimination, but rather to the lack of this. He lost self-control--the\nfirst step into the abyss of ignorance.\n\n[20:36](sbg06.htm#fr_14) _Felons:_ Atatayi, one who sets fire to the house of,\nadministers poison to, falls upon with a sword on, steals the wealth, land and\nwife of, another person. Duryodhana did all these to the Pandava brothers.\nAccording to the Artha Shastras, no sin is incurred by killing an Atatayin,\neven if he be thoroughly versed in Vedanta. But Arjuna seems to argue, "True,\nthere may not be incurred the particular sin of slaying one\'s own kith and kin\nby killing the sons of Dhritarashtra inasmuch as they are Atatayins, but then\nthe general sin of killing is sure to take hold of us, for Dharma Shastra\nwhich is more authoritative than Artha Shastra enjoins non-killing."\n\n[23:42](sbg06.htm#fr_15) Verily, confusion of family is the hell of destroyers\nof family. (For then do) their own ancestors fall, deprived &c. This refers to\nthe well-known Sraddha ceremony of the Hindus, the main principle of which\nconsists in sending helpful thoughts to the dead relations, as well as to all\nthe occupants of Pitri-loka (a temporary abode, immediately after death)\naccompanied with (to make the thoughts more forcible) concrete offerings. The\npoor are also fed to secure their good wishes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Second Chapter. The Way of Knowledge](sbg07.htm)\n\n'
