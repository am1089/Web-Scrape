Kus'agranthi, Jivapattri and other\nrosaries cannot compare to one-sixteenth part of the Rudrak _s_ a rosary. As\nVi _sn_ u is the best of all the Puru _s_ as, the Ganga is the best of all the\nrivers, Kas'yapa, amongst the Munis, Uchchai _h_ srava amongst the horses,\nMaha Deva amongst the Devas, Bhagavati amongst the Devis, so the Rudrak _s_ am\nrosary is the best of all the rosaries. All the fruits that occur by reading\nthe stotras and holding all the Vratas, are obtained by wearing the Rudrak _s_\nam bead. At the time of making the Ak _s_ aya gift, the Rudrak _s_ am bead is\ncapable of giving high merits. The merit that accrues by giving Rudrak _s_ am\nto a peaceful devotee of S\xc2\x92iva, cannot be expressed in words. If anybody gives\nfood to a man holding the Rudrak _s_ am rosary, his twenty one generations are\nuplifted and he ultimately becomes able to live in the Rudra Loka. He who does\nnot apply ashes on his forehead and who does not hold Rudrak _s_ am and is\naverse to the worship of S\xc2\x92iva is inferior to a cha _nd_ ala. If Rudrak _s_ am\nbe placed on the head then the flesh-eaters, drunkards, and the associates\nwith the vicious become freed of their sins. Whatever fruits are obtained by\nperforming various sacrifices, asceticism and the study of the Vedas are\neasily attained by simply holding the Rudrak _s_ am rosary. Whatever merits\nare obtained by read-\n\n\n\np. 1070\n\n\n\ning the four Vedas and all the Pura _n_ as and bathing in all the Tirthas and\nthe results that are obtained by immense practice in learning all are obtained\nby wearing Rudrak _s_ am. If at the time of death, one wears Rudrak _s_ am and\ndies, one attains Rudrahood. One has not to take again one's birth. If anybody\ndies by holding Rudrak _s_ am on his neck or on his two arms, he uplifts his\ntwenty-one generations and lives in the Rudra Loka. Be he a Brahma _n_ or a\nCha _nd_ ala, be he with qualities or without qualities, if he applies ashes\nto his body and holds Rudrak _s_ am he surely attains S\xc2\x92ivahood. Be he pure or\nimpure; whether he eats uneatables or be he a Mlechha or a Cha _nd_ ala or a\nGreat Sinner, any body if he holds Rudrak _s_ am is surely equal to Rudra.\nThere is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\nIf any body holds Rudrak _s_ am on his head he gets Ko _t_ i times the fruit;\non his ears, ten Ko _t_ i times the fruit, on his neck, one hundred Ko _t_ i\ntimes the fruit; on his holy thread, ayuta times the fruit; on his arm, one\nlakh Ko _t_ i times the fruit and if one wears Rudrak _s_ am on one's wrist,\none attains Mok _s_ a. Whatever acts, mentioned in the Vedas be performed with\nRudrak _s_ am on, the fruits obtained are unbounded. Even if a man be without\nany Bhakti and if he wears on his neck the Rudrak _s_ a rosary though he does\nalways vicious acts, he becomes freed of the bondage of this world. Even if a\nman does not hold Rudrak _s_ a but if he be always full of devotion towards\nthe Rudrak _s_ am, he attains the fruit that is got by wearing the Rudrak _s_\nam and he attains the S\xc2\x92iva Loka and is honoured like S\xc2\x92iva. As in the country\nof Kikata, an ass which used to carry Rudrak _s_ am seed got S\xc2\x92ivahood after\nhis death, so any man, whether he be a J\xc3\xb1ani (wise) or Ajnani (unwise), gets\nS\xc2\x92ivahood if he holds Rudrak _s_ am. There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n22-28. Skanda said :-- \xc2\x93O God! How is it that in the country of Kika _t_ a\n(Bihar), an ass had to carry Rudrak _s_ a; who gave him the Rudrak _s_ ams!\nAnd what for did he hold that?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nBhagavan \xc3\x8es'vara said :-- O Son! Now hear the history of the case. In the\nBindhya mountain one ass used to carry the load of Rudrak _s_ am of a\ntraveller. Once the ass felt tired and became unable to carry the load and\nfell down on the road and died. After his death the ass came to Me by My\nGrace, becoming Mahes'vara with trident in his hand and with three eyes. O\nKartikeya! As many faces as there are in the Rudrak _s_ am, for so many\nthousand Yugas the holder resides with honour in the S\xc2\x92iva Loka. One should\ndeclare the greatness of Rudrak _s_ am to one's own disciple; never to\ndisclose its glories to one who is not a disciple nor a devotee of Rudrak _s_\nam nor to him who is an illiterate brute. Be he a Bhakta or not a\n\n\n\np. 1071\n\n\n\nBhakta, be be low or very low, if he holds Rudrak _s_ am then he is freed from\nall sins. No equal can be to the merit of him who holds the Rudrak _s_ ams.\n\n\n\n29-39. The Munis, the Seers of truth, describe this holding on of Rudrak _s_\nam as a very great vow. He who makes a vow to hold one thousand Rudrak _s_\nams, becomes like Rudra; the Devas bow down before him. If thousand Rudrak _s_\nams be not obtained, one should hold at least sixteen Rudrak _s_ ams on each\narm, one Rudrak _s_ am on the crown hair; on the two hands, twelve on each;\nthirty-two on the neck; forty on the head; six on each ear and one hundred and\neight Rudrak _s_ ams on the breast; and then he becomes entitled to worship\nlike Rudra. If any body holds Rudrak _s_ am together with pearls, Prabala,\ncrystal, silver, gold and gem (lapis lazuli), he becomes a manifestation of\nS'iva. If a body, through laziness even, holds Rudrak _s_ am, the sin cannot\ntouch him as darkness cannot come near light. If any body makes japam of a\nmantram with a Rudrak _s_ a rosary, he gets unbounded results. Such a merit\ngiving Rudrak _s_ am, if one such Rudrak _s_ am be not found in any one's\nbody, his life becomes useless, like a man who is void of Tripu _nd_ rak\n(three curved horizontal marks made on the forehead by the worshippers of\nS'iva). If any body simply washes his head all over with Rudrak _s_ am on, he\ngets the fruit of bathing in the Ganges. There is no doubt in this. One faced\nRudrak _s_ am, the five faced, eleven faced and fourteen faced Rudrak _s_ ams\nare highly meritorious and entitled to worship by all. The Rudrak _s_ am is\nS'ankara made manifest; so it is always worshipped with devotion. The\ngreatness of Rudrak _s_ am is such as it can make a king out of a poor man. On\nthis point, I will tell you an excellent Puranic anecdote.\n\n\n\n40-49. There was a Brahmi _n_ , named Girinatha in the country of Kosala. He\nwas proficient in the Vedas and Vedamgas, religious and very rich. He used to\nperform sacrifices. He had a beautiful son named Gu _n_ anidhi. The son\ngradually entered into his youth and looked beautiful like Kandarpa, the God\nof Love. While he was studying at his Guru Sudhi _s_ a _n_ a's house, he, by\nhis beauty and youth captivated the mind of his Guru's wife named Muktavali.\nThe Guru's wife became so much enchanted by his extraordinary beauty that she,\nbeing unable to control herself, mixed with him and for some time remained\nwith him in secret enjoyment. Then feeling inconveniences, due to the fear of.\nhis Guru, to enjoy her freely, used poison to the Guru, killed him and then he\nbegan to live freely with her. Next when his father, mother came to know about\nthis, he put to death instantly his father and mother, administering poison to\nthem. He became\n\n\n\np. 1072\n\n\n\naddicted to various pleasures and his wealth was exhausted gradually. He began\nto steal in Brahma _n_ s' houses and became addicted very much to drinking.\nHis relatives outcasted him from the society for his bad behaviour and\nbanished him outside the town. He then went into a dense forest with\nMuktavali; and he began to kill the Brahmi _n_ s for their wealth. Thus a long\ntime passed away; when at last he fell into the jaws of death.\n\n\n\n50-54. Then to take him to the region of Death, thousands of the Yama's\nmessengers came; at the same time the S\xc2\x92iva's messengers came from S\xc2\x92iva Loka.\nO Kartikeya! A quarrel then ensued between both the parties of Yama and S\xc2\x92iva.\nThe Yama's messengers then said :-- \xc2\x93O Servers of S\xc2\x92ambhu! What are the merits\nof this man that you have come to take him? First speak to us of his merits.\xc2\x94\nS\xc2\x92iva's messengers spoke :-- \xc2\x93Fifteen feet below the ground where this man\ndied, there exists the Rudrak _s_ am. O Yama's messengers! By the influence of\nthat Rudrak _s_ am, all his sins are destroyed; and we have come to take him\nto S\xc2\x92iva.\xc2\x94 Then the Brahmi _n_ Gu _n_ anidhi assumed a divine form and,\ngetting on an aerial car went with S'iva's messengers before S'iva. O One of\ngood vows! Thus I have described briefly to you the greatness of Rudrak _s_\nam. This is capable to remove all sorts of sins and yield great merits.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the Greatness of Rudrak\n_s_ ams in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7](bk11ch07.htm)\n\n"
