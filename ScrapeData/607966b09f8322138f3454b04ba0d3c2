And on account of the statement of the way of him who has heard the\nUpanishads.\n\nThe person placed in the eye is the highest lord for the following reason\nalso. From _s_ ruti as well as sm _ri_ ti we are acquainted with the way of\nhim who has heard the Upanishads or the secret knowledge, i. e. who knows\nBrahman. That way, called the path of the gods, is described (Pra. Up. I, 10),\n'Those who have sought the Self by penance, abstinence, faith, and knowledge\ngain by the northern path the sun. This is the home of the spirits, the\nimmortal, free from fear, the highest. From thence they do not return;' and\nalso (Bha. Gita VIII, 24), 'Fire, light, the bright fortnight, the six months\nof the northern progress of the sun, on that way those who know Brahman go,\nwhen they have died, to Brahman.' Now that very same way is seen to be stated,\nin our text, for him who knows the person within the eye. For we read ( _Kh_.\nUp. IV, 15, 5), 'Now whether people perform obsequies for him or no he goes to\nlight;' and later on, 'From the sun (he goes) to the moon, from the moon to\nlightning. There is a person not human, he leads them to Brahman. This is the\npath of the gods, the path that leads to Brahman. Those who proceed on that\npath do not return to the life of man.' From this description of the way which\nis known to be the way of him who knows Brahman we ascertain that the person\nwithin the eye is Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 17](sbe34054.htm)\n\n"
