XII.\n\nDhruva commences a course of religious austerities. Unsuccessful attempts of\nIndra and his ministers to distract Dhruva\'s attention: they appeal to\nVishn\xcc\x81u, who allays their fears, and appears to Dhruva. Dhruva praises\nVishn\xcc\x81u, and is raised to the skies as the pole-star.\n\nTHE prince, having received these instructions, respectfully saluted the\nsages, and departed from the forest, fully confiding in the accomplishment of\nhis purposes. He repaired to the holy place, on the banks of the Yamuna,\ncalled Madhu or Madhuvana, the grove of Madhu, after the demon of that name,\nwho formerly abided there. \xc5\x9aatrughna (the younger brother of Rama) having\nslain the Rakshas Lavan\xcc\x81a, the son of Madhu, founded a city on the spot, which\nwas named Mathura. At this holy shrine, the purifier from all sin, which\nenjoyed the presence of the sanctifying god of gods, Dhruva performed penance,\nas enjoined by Marichi and the sages: he contemplated Vishn\xcc\x81u, the sovereign\nof all the gods, seated in himself. Whilst his mind was wholly absorbed in\nmeditation, the mighty Hari, identical with all beings and with all natures,\n(took possession of his heart.) Vishn\xcc\x81u being thus present in his mind, the\nearth, the supporter of elemental life, could not sustain the weight of the\nascetic. As he stood upon his left foot, one hemisphere bent beneath him; and\nwhen he stood upon his right, the other half of the earth sank down. When he\ntouched the earth with his toes, it shook with all its mountains, and the\nrivers and the [seas](errata.htm#4) were troubled, and the gods partook of the\nuniversal agitation.\n\nThe celestials called Yamas, being excessively alarmed, then took counsel with\nIndra how they should interrupt the devout exercises of Dhruva; and the divine\nbeings termed Kushman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, in company with their king, commenced anxious\nefforts to distract his meditations. One, assuming the semblance of his mother\nSuniti, stood weeping before him, and calling in tender accents, "My son, my\nson, desist from destroying thy strength by this fearful penance. I have\ngained thee, my son, after\n\np. 91\n\nmuch anxious hope: thou canst not have the cruelty to quit me, helpless,\nalone, and unprotected, on account of the unkindness of my rival. Thou art my\nonly refuge; I have no hope but thou. What hast thou, a child but five years\nold, to do with rigorous penance? Desist from such fearful practices, that\nyield no beneficial fruit. First comes the season of youthful pastime; and\nwhen that is over, it is the time for study: then succeeds the period of\nworldly enjoyment; and lastly, that of austere devotion. This is thy season of\npastime, my child. Hast thou engaged in these practices to put an end to thine\nexistence? Thy chief duty is love for me: duties are according to time of\nlife. Lose not thyself in bewildering error: desist from such unrighteous\nactions. If not, if thou wilt not desist from these austerities, I will\nterminate my life before thee."\n\nBut Dhruva, being wholly intent on seeing Vishn\xcc\x81u, beheld not his mother\nweeping in his presence, and calling upon him; and the illusion, crying out,\n"Fly, fly, my child, the hideous spirits of ill are crowding into this\ndreadful forest with uplifted weapons," quickly disappeared. Then advanced\nfrightful Rakshasas, wielding terrible arms, and with countenances emitting\nfiery flame; and nocturnal fiends thronged around the prince, uttering fearful\nnoises, and whirling and tossing their threatening weapons. Hundreds of\njackals, from whose mouths gushed flame 1 as they devoured their prey, were\nhowling aloud, to appal the boy, wholly engrossed by meditation. The goblins\ncalled out, "Kill him, kill him; cut him to pieces; eat him, eat him;" and\nmonsters, with the faces of lions and camels and crocodiles, roared and yelled\nwith horrible cries, to terrify the prince. But all these uncouth spectres,\nappalling cries, and threatening weapons, made no impression upon his senses,\nwhose mind was completely intent on Govinda. The son of the monarch of the\nearth, engrossed by one only idea, beheld uninterruptedly Vishn\xcc\x81u seated in\nhis soul, and saw no other object.\n\nAll their delusive stratagems being thus foiled, the gods were more perplexed\nthan ever. Alarmed at their discomfiture, and afflicted by\n\np. 92\n\nthe devotions of the boy, they assembled and repaired for succour to Hari, the\norigin of the world, who is without beginning or end; and thus addressed him:\n"God of gods, sovereign of the world, god supreme, and infinite spirit,\ndistressed by the austerities of Dhruva, we have come to thee for protection.\nAs the moon increases in his orb day by day, so this youth advances\nincessantly towards superhuman power by his devotions. Terrified by the\nascetic practices of the son of Uttanapada, we have come to thee for succour.\nDo thou allay the fervour of his meditations. We know not to what station he\naspires: to the throne of Indra, the regency of the solar or lunar sphere, or\nto the sovereignty of riches or of the deep. Have compassion on us, lord;\nremove this affliction from Our breasts; divert the son of Uttanapada from\npersevering in his penance." Vishn\xcc\x81u replied to the gods; "The lad desireth\nneither the rank of Indra, nor the solar orb, nor the sovereignty of wealth or\nof the ocean: all that he solicits, I will grant. Return therefore, deities,\nto your mansions as ye list, and be no more alarmed: I will put an end to the\npenance of the boy, whose mind is immersed in deep contemplation."\n\nThe gods, being thus pacified by the supreme, saluted him respectfully and\nretired, and, preceded by Indra, returned to their habitations: but Hari, who\nis all things, assuming a shape with four arms, proceeded to Dhruva, being\npleased with his identity of nature, and thus addressed him: "Son of\nUttanapada, be prosperous. Contented with thy devotions, I, the giver of\nboons, am present. Demand what boon thou desirest. In that thou hast wholly\ndisregarded external objects, and fixed thy thoughts on me, I am well pleased\nwith thee. Ask, therefore, a suitable reward." The boy, hearing these words of\nthe god of gods, opened his eyes, and beholding that Hari whom he had before\nseen in his meditations actually in his presence, bearing in his hands the\nshell, the discus, the mace, the bow, and scimetar, and crowned with a diadem,\nthe bowed his head down to earth; the hair stood erect on his brow, and his\nheart was depressed with awe. He reflected how best he should offer thanks to\nthe god of gods; what he could say in his adoration; what words were capable\nof expressing his praise: and being overwhelmed with perplexity, he had\nrecourse for consolation to the deity. "If," he\n\np. 93\n\nexclaimed, "the lord is contented with my devotions, let this be my reward,\nthat I may know how to praise him as I wish. How can I, a child, pronounce his\npraises, whose abode is unknown to Brahma and to others learned in the Vedas?\nMy heart is overflowing with devotion to thee: oh lord, grant me the faculty\nworthily to lay mine adorations at thy feet."\n\nWhilst lowly bowing, with his hands uplifted to his forehead, Govinda, the\nlord of the world, touched the son of Uttanapada with the tip of his conch-\nshell, and immediately the royal youth, with a countenance sparkling with\ndelight, praised respectfully the imperishable protector of living beings. "I\nvenerate," exclaimed Dhruva, "him whose forms are earth, water, fire, air,\nether, mind, intellect, the first element (Ahankara), primeval nature, and the\npure, subtile, all-pervading soul, that surpasses nature. Salutation to that\nspirit that is void of qualities; that is supreme over all the elements and\nall the objects of sense, over intellect, over nature and spirit. I have taken\nrefuge with that pure form of thine, oh supreme, which is one with Brahma,\nwhich is spirit, which transcends all the world. Salutation to that form\nwhich, pervading and supporting all, is designated Brahma, unchangeable, and\ncontemplated by religious sages. Thou art the male with a thousand heads, a\nthousand eyes, a thousand feet, who traversest the universe, and passest ten\ninches beyond its contact 2. Whatever has been, or is to be, that,\nPurushottama, thou art. From thee sprang Virat, Swarat, Samrat, and\nAdhipurusha 3. The lower, and upper, and middle parts of the earth are not\nindependent of thee: from thee is all this universe, all that has been, and\nthat shall be: and all this world is in thee, assuming this universal form 4.\nFrom thee is sacrifice\n\np. 94\n\nderived, and all oblations, and curds, and ghee, and animals of either class\n(domestic or wild). From thee the Rig-Veda, the Sama, the metres of the Vedas,\nand the Yajur-Veda are born. Horses, and cows having teeth in one jaw only 5,\nproceed from thee; and from thee come goats, sheep, deer. Brahmans sprang from\nthy mouth; warriors from thy arms; Vaisyas from thy thighs; and \xc5\x9audras from\nthy feet. From thine eyes come the sun; from thine ears, the wind; and from\nthy mind, the moon: the vital airs from thy central vein; and fire from thy\nmouth: the sky from thy navel; and heaven from thy head: the regions from\nthine ears; the earth from thy feet. All this world was derived from thee. As\nthe wide-spreading Nyagrodha (Indian fig) tree is compressed in a small seed\n6, so, at the time of dissolution, the whole universe is comprehended in thee\nas its germ. As the Nyagrodha germinates from the seed, and becomes first a\nshoot, and then rises into loftiness, so the created world proceeds from thee,\nand expands into magnitude. As the bark and leaves of the Plantain tree are to\nbe seen in its stem, so thou art the stem of the universe, and all things are\nvisible in thee. The faculties of the intellect, that are the cause of\npleasure and of pain, abide in thee as one with all existence; but the sources\nof pleasure and of pain, singly or blended, do not exist in thee, who art\nexempt from all qualities 7. Salutation to thee, the subtile rudiment, which,\nbeing single, becomes\n\np. 95\n\nmanifold, Salutation to thee, soul of existent things, identical with the\ngreat elements. Thou, imperishable, art beheld in spiritual knowledge as\nperceptible objects, as nature, as spirit, as the world, as Brahma, as Manu,\nby internal contemplation. But thou art in all, the element of all; thou art\nall, assuming every form; all is from thee, and thou art from thyself. I\nsalute thee, universal soul: glory be to thee. Thou art one with all things:\noh lord of all, thou art present in all things. What can I say unto thee? thou\nknowest all that is in the heart, oh soul of all, sovereign lord of all\ncreatures, origin of all things. Thou, who art all beings, knowest the desires\nof all creatures. The desire that I cherished has been gratified, lord, by\nthee: my devotions have been crowned with success, in that I have seen thee."\n\nVishn\xcc\x81u said to Dhruva; "The object of thy devotions has in truth been\nattained, in that thou hast seen me; for the sight of me, young prince, is\nnever unproductive. Ask therefore of me what boon thou desirest; for men in\nwhose sight I appear obtain all their wishes." To this, Dhruva answered; "Lord\ngod of all creatures, who abidest in the hearts of all, how should the wish\nthat I cherish be unknown to thee? I will confess unto thee the hope that my\npresumptuous heart has entertained; a hope that it would be difficult to\ngratify, but that nothing is difficult when thou, creator of the world, art\npleased. Through thy favour, Indra reigns over the three worlds. The sister-\nqueen of my mother has said to me, loudly and arrogantly, \'The royal throne is\nnot for one who is not born of me;\' and I now solicit of the support of the\nuniverse an exalted station, superior to all others, and one that shall endure\nfor ever." Vishn\xcc\x81u said to him; "The station that thou askest thou shalt\nobtain; for I was satisfied with thee of old in a prior existence. Thou wast\nformerly a Brahman, whose thoughts were ever devoted to me, ever dutiful to\nthy parents, and observant of thy duties. In course of time a prince became\nthy friend, who was in the period of youth, indulged in all sensual pleasures,\n.and was of handsome appearance and elegant form. Beholding, in consequence of\nassociating with him, his affluence, you formed the desire that you might be\nsubsequently born as the son of a king; and, according to your wish, you\nobtained a\n\np. 96\n\nprincely birth in the illustrious mansion of Uttanapada. But that which would\nhave been thought a great boon by others, birth in the race of Swayambhuva,\nyou have not so considered, and therefore have propitiated me. The man who\nworships me obtains speedy liberation from life. What is heaven to one whose\nmind is fixed on me? A station shall be assigned to thee, Dhruva, above the\nthree worlds 8; one in which thou shalt sustain the stars and the planets; a\nstation above those of the sun, the moon, Mars, the son of Soma (Mercury),\nVenus, the son of Surya (Saturn), and all the other constellations; above the\nregions of the seven Rishis, and the divinities who traverse the atmosphere 9.\nSome celestial beings endure for four ages; some for the reign of a Manu: to\nthee shall be granted the duration of a Kalpa. Thy mother Suniti, in the orb\nof a bright star, shall abide near thee for a similar term; and all those who,\nwith minds attentive, shall glorify thee at dawn or at eventide, shall acquire\nexceeding religious merit.\n\nThus the sage Dhruva, having received a boon from Janarddana, the god of gods,\nand lord of the world, resides in an exalted station. Beholding his glory,\nU\xc5\x9banas, the preceptor of the gods and demons, repeated these verses:\n"Wonderful is the efficacy of this penance, marvellous is its reward, that the\nseven Rishis should be preceded by Dhruva. This too is the pious Suniti, his\nparent, who is called Sunrita 10." Who can\n\np. 97\n\ncelebrate her greatness, who, having given birth to Dhruva, has become the\nasylum of the three worlds, enjoying to all future time an elevated station, a\nstation eminent above all? He who shall worthily describe the ascent into the\nsky of Dhruva, for ever shall be freed from all sin, and enjoy the heaven of\nIndra. Whatever be his dignity, whether upon earth or in heaven, he shall\nnever fall from it, but shall long enjoy life, possessed of every blessing 11.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[91:1](vp047.htm#fr_254) A marginal note by a Bengali Pundit asserts it to be\na fact, then when a jackal carries a piece of meat in his mouth, it shews in\nthe dark as if it was on fire.\n\n[93:2](vp047.htm#fr_255) The commentator understands this passage to imply\nmerely that the supreme pervades both substance and space, being infinitely\nvast, and without limit. \'Having a thousand heads,\' &c. denotes only infinite\nextension: and the \'ten inches beyond the contact of the universe\' expresses\nmerely non-restriction by its boundaries.\n\n[93:3](vp047.htm#fr_256) Explained severally the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, or material\nuniverse; Brahma, the creator; Manu, the ruler of the period; and supreme or\npresiding spirit.\n\n[93:4](vp047.htm#fr_257) So the inscription upon the temple of Sais: \xe1\xbc\x98\xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xbc \xce\xb5\xe1\xbc\xb6\xce\xbc\xce\xb9\n\xcf\x80\xe1\xbe\xb6\xce\xbd \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xce\xb3\xce\xb5\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb8\xcf\x82, \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xe1\xbd\x82\xce\xbd, \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xe1\xbc\x90\xcf\x83\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbd.

But pleasure depends upon the quality of\ngoodness, pain on that of darkness, and their mixture on that of foulness,\ninherent in the understanding; properties belonging to Jive\xc5\x9bwara, or god, as\none with life, or to embodied spirit, but not as Parame\xc5\x9bwara, or supreme\nspirit.\n\n[96:8](vp047.htm#fr_261) The station or sphere is that of the north pole, or\nof the polar star. In the former case, the star is considered to be Suniti,\nthe mother of Dhruva. The legend, although as it is related in our text it\ndiffers in its circumstances from the story told by Ovid of Callisto and her\nson Areas, whom Jove\n\nImposuit caelo vicinaque sidera fecit,\n\nsuggests some suspicion of an original identity. In neither of the authorities\nhave we, perhaps, the primitive fable. It is evident from the quotation that\npresently follows in the text, of a stanza by Nanas, that the Puran\xcc\x81a has not\nthe oldest version of the legend; and Ovid\'s representation of it is after a\nfashion of his own: all that has been retained of the original is the\nconformity of the characters and of the main incident, the translation of a\nmother and her son to the heavens as constellations, in which the pole-star is\nthe most conspicuous luminary.\n\n[96:9](vp047.htm#fr_262) The Vaimanika devas, the deities who travel in\nVimanas, \'heavenly cars,\' or rather \'moving spheres.\'\n\n[96:10](vp047.htm#fr_263) The text says merely ###; the commentator says,\n\'perhaps formerly so called;\' ###. We have already remarked that some Puran\xcc\x81as\nso denominate her.\n\n[97:11](vp047.htm#fr_264) The legend of Dhruva is narrated in the Bhagavata,\nPadma (Swerga Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a), Agni, and Naradiya, much to the same purport, and\npartly in the same words, as our text. The Brahma and its double the Hari\nVan\xc5\x9ba, the Matsya, and Vayu merely allude to Dhruva\'s having been transferred\nby Brahma to the skies, in reward of his austerities. The story of his\nreligious penance, and adoration of Vishn\xcc\x81u, seems to be an embellishment\ninterpolated by the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Puran\xcc\x81as, Dhruva being adopted as a saint by\ntheir sect. The allusion to Sunrita in our text concurs with the form of the\nstory as it appears elsewhere, to indicate the priority of the more simple\nlegend.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIII](vp048.htm)\n\n'
