 \nThou art my refuge: O, be kind,  \nLeave me not, dear my lord, behind.  \nThou canst not, brother, if thou choose  \nThat I still live, my wish refuse.'  \n\nThe glorious chief his speech renewed  \nTo faithful Lakshman as he sued,  \nAnd on the eyes of Rama gazed  \nLonging to load, with hands upraised:  \n'Thou art a hero just and dear,  \nWhose steps to virtue's path adhere,  \nLoved as my life till life shall end.  \nMy faithful brother and my friend.  \nIf to the woods thou take thy way  \nWith Sita and with me to-day,  \nWho for Kaus'alya will provide,  \nAnd guard the good Sumitra's side?  \nThe lord of earth, of mighty power,  \nWho sends good things in plenteous shower,  \nAs Indra pours the grateful rain,  \nA captive lies in passion's chain.  \nThe power imperial for her son  \nHas As'vapati's daughter  1 won,  \nAnd she, proud queen, will little heed  \nHer miserable rivals' need.  \n\nSo Bharat, ruler of the land,  \nBy Queen Kaikeyi's side will stand,  \nNor of those two will ever think.  \nWhile grieving in despair they sink.  \nNow, Lakshman, as thy love decrees,  \nOr else the monarch's heart to please,  \nFollow this counsel and protect  \nMy honoured mother from neglect.  \nSo thou, while not to me alone  \nThy great affection will be shown,  \nTo highest duty wilt adhere  \nBy serving those thou shouldst revere.  \nNow, son of Raghu, for my sake  \nObey this one request I make,  \nOr, of her darling son bereft,  \nKausaly'a has no comfort left.'  \n\nThe faithful Lakshman, thus addressed  \nIn gentle words which love expressed,  \nTo him in lore of language learned,  \nHis answer, eloquent, returned:  \n'Nay, through thy might each queen will share  \nAttentive Bharat's love and care.  \nShould Bharat, raised as king to sway  \nThis noblest realm, his trust betray,  \nNor for their safety well provide,  \nSeduced by ill-suggesting pride,  \nDoubt not my vengeful hand shall kill  \nThe cruel wretch who counsels ill--  \nKill him and all who lend him aid,  \nAnd the three worlds in league arrayed.  \nAnd good Kausaly'a well can fee  \nA thousand champions like to me.  \nA thousand hamlets rich in grain  \nThe station of that queen maintain.  \nShe may, and my dear mother too,  \nLive on the ample revenue.  \nThen let me follow thee: herein  \nIs naught that may resemble sin.  \nSo shall I in my wish suceed,  \nAnd aid, perhaps, my brother's need.  \nMy bow and quiver well supplied  \nWith arrows hanging at my side,  \nMy hands shall spade and basket bear,  \nAnd for thy feet the way prepare.  \nI'll bring thee roots and berries sweet.  \nAnd woodland fare which hermits eat.  \nThou shall with thy Videhan spouse  \nRecline upon the mountain's brows:  \nBe mine the toil, be mine to keep  \nWatch o'er thee waking or asleep.'  \n\nFilled by his speech with joy and pride  \nRama to Lakshman thus replied:  \n'Go then, my brother, bid adieu  \nTo all thy friends and retinue.  \nAnd those two bows of fearful might,  \nCelestial, which, at that famed rite,  \nLord Varun gave to Janak, king  \nOf fair Videha with thee bring,  \nWith heavenly coats of sword-proof mail,  \nQuivers, whose arrows never fail,  \n\np. 132  \n\nAnd golden-hilted swords so keen,  \nThe rivals of the sun in sheen.  \nTended with care these arms are all  \nPreserved in my preceptor's hall.  \nWith speed, O Lakshman, go, produce,  \nAnd bring them hither for our use.'  \nSo on a woodland life intent,  \nTo see his faithful friends he went,  \nAnd brought the heavenly arms which lay  \nBy Rama's teacher stored away,  \nAnd Raghu's son to Rama showed  \nThose wondrous arms which gleamed and glowed,  \nWell kept, adorned with many a wreath  \nOf flowers on case, and hilt, and sheath.  \nThe prudent Rama at the sight  \nAddressed his brother with delight:  \n'Well art thou come, my brother dear.  \nFor much I longed to see thee here.  \nFor with thine aid, before I go,  \nI would my gold and wealth bestow  \nUpon the Brahmans sage, who school  \nTheir lives by stern devotion's rule.  \nAnd for all those who ever dwell  \nWithin my house and serve me well,  \nDevoted servants, true and good,  \nWill I provide a livelihood.  \n   Quick, go and summon to this place  \n     The good Vas'ishtha's son,  \n   Suyajna, of the Brahman race  \n     The first and holiest one.  \n   To all the Brahmans wise and good  \n     Will I due reverence pay,  \n   Then to the solitary wood  \n     With thee will take my way.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[131:1](ry109.htm#fr_306) Kaikeyi.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXII.: The Gift of The Treasures.](ry110.htm)\n\n"
