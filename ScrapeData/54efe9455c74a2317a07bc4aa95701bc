On seeing\nthem, the whole court rose up; and then, having performed obeisance, and\nthrown down silken cloths for them to walk upon, they conducted all the sages\ninto the assembly, after this Shree Krishnu Chund having placed them all upon\nseats, and having washed their feet drank the water with which their feet had\nbeen washed, and sprinkled it upon the whole assembly; then having offered\nsandal, unbroken rice, flowers, perfumes, lamps and consecrated food, Bhugwan\nworshipped them all, and went round to the right by way of adoration; and,\nstanding in their presence with joined hands, Huri said, "Great is our good\nfortune that you have come and visited us, and sat in our\n\np. 415\n\nhouse; the sight of a good man is equal to bathing in the Ganges, he who has\nseen a holy man (or received a visit from a holy man) has had the crime of\neach birth effaced."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! when Shree Bhugwan had thus spoken, then all the sages remained\nreflecting, "When the lord, who is in the form of light, and the creator of\nthe universe, says this, what need we care what any one else may say, or has\nsaid?" Whilst the sages thought thus in their minds, Narud Jee said, "Listen\nto me all ye of the assembly with attention: the delusive power of Huri cannot\nbe comprehended this power, in the form of Bruhmu, creates; as Vishnu, it\npreserves; as Shivu, it destroys: its nature is infinite, beyond the\ncomprehension of man\'s intellect; but by his favour we know so much, that\nVishnu frequently descends upon the earth to confer happiness upon holy men,\ndestroy the wicked and promote what is eternally right."\n\nWhen, O great king! having thus spoken, Narud Jee was on the point of rising\nup and leaving the assembly, Basoodeo came before him, and, with joined hands\nand with submissiveness, said, "O chief of the sages! be pleased to favour us\nby saying, how a man, having come into the world, can escape from fate."\n\nO great king! when Basoodeo Jee had thus spoken, all the holy men and sages\nremained looking at the countenance of Narud Jee; then Narud Jee,\nunderstanding the wishes of their minds, said to the sages, "O divinities! be\nnot astonished at this speech; the delusive power of Shree Krishnu is mighty,\nit has overcome and conquered the whole world, and therefore Basoodeo Jee has\nthus spoken, and some one else has also thus said, \'Near whom, whoever\nremains, he is under the influence of his good qualities, and subjected to the\nillusion of his glory, without being aware of it.\' As\n\np. 416\n\nany one living on the banks of the Ganges, who goes elsewhere; and, having\nabandoned the Ganges, drinks well water, so have the Judoos become\nunintelligent; and do not comprehend at all the nature of Krishnu." Narud Jee\nhaving by these words removed the perplexities of the sages, said to Basoodeo\nJee, "O great king! it is written in the Shastrus, that the man, who performs\npilgrimage, makes offerings, or performs penance, or fasts or offers\nsacrifice, having escaped from the bonds of the world, will obtain supreme\nfelicity." On hearing these words, Basoodeo Jee was delighted, and immediately\nprocured and made ready all things necessary for a sacrifice, and said to the\nsaints and sages, "Please favour me by commencing the sacrifice."\n\nWhen, O great king! Basoodeo Jee had thus spoken, all the brahmins prepared\nand arranged a building for the sacrifice. Upon this Basoodeo Jee went and sat\nwith his wives near the altar; and all the Rajas and the Judoos prepared to\nassist in the sacrifice.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja,--O great king! when Basoodeo went and sat at the altar, the sages began\nthe sacrifice according to the injunctions of the Vedas; and, after reading\nincantations from the Vedas, they began to offer oblations with fire to the\ndeities; and the gods in bodily shape came running to receive them.\n\nWhen, O great king! the sacrifice was begun; above, the celestial choristers\nand musicians, playing upon pipes and drums, began to sing of the excellences\nof the gods; and bards and panegyrists to celebrate their praises. Oorbusee\nand the other celestial courtezans danced; and the gods, seated in their\nchariots, rained down flowers; and below, the singers and dancers sang and\ndanced, and engaged in festivities; and beggars raised cries of exultation and\nrejoicing, in midst of which the sacrifice was completed. And Basoodeo Jee,\nhaving offered the final oblation and arrayed the brahmins in silken clothes,\nand adorned them with ornaments,\n\np. 417\n\npresented them with many jewels, and much wealth: and they read incantations\nfrom the Vedas, and pronounced their blessing. After this, Basoodeo presented\nrobes to, and entertained the kings of different countries, who then offered\nthe sacrificial gifts; and taking leave, returned home. On the departure of\nthe Rajas, all the sages and saints and Narud Jee also took leave.\n\nIt is not possible to describe the subsequent scene, when Nund Rae Jee and the\ncowherdesses, and the cowherds and their children were about to take leave of\nBasoodeo. The descendants of Judoo, on the one hand, made all kinds of\naffectionate speeches; and the inhabitants of Bruj, on the other hand, did so\nlikewise; this happy scene must have been witnessed to be understood, I cannot\nattempt to describe it. At length, Basoodeo and Shree Krishnu, and Bulram,\nhaving entered into explanations with Nund Rae Jee and the rest of the party,\nand made them understand, and having arrayed them in honorary dresses, and\nbestowed great wealth upon them, allowed them to take leave.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! when Shree Krishnu Chund and Bulram Jee returned to the city of Dwarka\nwith the rest of the party, after having bathed during the festival, and\noffered sacrifice, there were rejoicings and festivities in every house.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXXV](psa86.htm)\n\n'
