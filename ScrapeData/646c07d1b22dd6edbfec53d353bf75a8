We will explain the (secret) penances which are not prescribed (by others,\nbut by the offender himself, and) particularly what shall be done in (case)\nfaults (have been committed) by men who, with concentrated minds, (are) intent\n(on the performance of their duties). 1\n\n2\\. (Such a man) may sip water, (in order to atone) for all mortal sins,\nreciting the syllable Om and all the Vyah _ri_ tis. 2\n\n3\\. When he sips water the first time, he gladdens the Rig-veda, the second\ntime the Ya _g_ ur-veda, the third time the Sama-veda. 3\n\n4\\. When he wipes (his lips) the first time, he gladdens the Atharva-veda, the\nsecond time the Itihasas and Pura _n_ as.\n\n5\\. When he sprinkles water on the right hand, the feet, the head, the heart,\nthe nostrils, the eyes, the ears, and the navel, he gladdens the trees and\nherbs and all deities. Therefore he is freed from all sin by sipping water.\n\np. 321\n\n6\\. Or let him offer in the fire eight pieces of sacred fuel, reciting (the\nfollowing) eight (texts): \'Thou art the expiation of sin committed by the\ngods, Svaha;\' \'Thou art the expiation of sin committed by men, Svaha;\' \'Thou\nart the expiation of sin committed by the manes, Svaha;\' \'Thou art the\nexpiation of sin committed by myself, Svaha;\' \'Thou art the expiation of the\nsift which we have committed either by day or by night, Svaha;" Thou art the\nexpiation of the sin which we have committed either sleeping or waking,\nSvaha;\' \'Thou art the expiation of the sin which we have committed either\nintentionally or unintentionally, Svaha;\' Thou art the expiation of every sin,\nSvaha.\' 6\n\n7\\. When he has offered (these eight oblations) he will be freed from all\nguilt.\n\n8\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): \'The Aghamarsha _n_ a, the\nDevak _ri_ ta, the Suddhavatis, the Taratsamas, the Kushma _n_ _d_ is, the\nPavamanis, the Vira _g_ as, the M _ri_ tyula\xe1\xb9\x85gala, the Durga (Savitri), the\nVyah _ri_ tis, and the Rudras (are texts) which are very efficacious for\neffacing sin.\' 8\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[320:1](sbe1485.htm#fr_1423) **3**.
