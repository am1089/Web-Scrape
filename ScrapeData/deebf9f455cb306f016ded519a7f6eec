That same fire, then, they have kindled, (thinking), 'In it, when\nkindled, we will sacrifice to the gods.' In it, indeed, he makes these two\nfirst oblations 1 to Mind and Speech (or, Voice); for mind and speech, when\nyoked together, convey the sacrifice to the gods.\n\n1:4:4:22\\. Now, what is performed (with formulas, pronounced) in a low voice,\nby that the mind conveys the sacrifice to the gods; and what is performed\n(with formulas) distinctly uttered by speech, by that the speech conveys the\nsacrifice to the gods. And thus takes place here a twofold performance,\nwhereby\n\np. 125\n\nhe gratifies these two, thinking, 'gratified and pleased, these two shall\nconvey the sacrifice to the gods.'\n\n1:4:4:33\\. With the dipping-spoon (sruva, m.) he makes that libation (of\nclarified butter) which he makes for the mind; for the mind (manas, n.!) is\nmale, and male is the sruva.\n\n1:4:4:44\\. With the offering-spoon (sru _k_ , f.) he makes that libation which\nhe makes for speech (va _k_ , f.); for speech is female, and female is the sru\n_k_.\n\n1:4:4:55\\. Silently (without a formula) and even without 'svaha (hail)!' he\nmakes that libation which he makes for the mind; for undefined (or indistinct)\nis the mind, and undefined is what takes place silently.\n\n1:4:4:66\\. With a mantra he makes that libation which he makes for speech; for\ndistinct is speech, and distinct is the formula.\n\n1:4:4:77\\. Sitting he makes that libation which he makes for the mind, and\nstanding that which he makes for speech. Mind and speech, when yoked together,\nassuredly convey the sacrifice to the gods. But when one of two yoke-fellows\nis smaller (than the other) they give him a shoulder-piece 1. Now speech is\nindeed smaller than mind; for mind is by far the more unlimited, and speech is\nby far the more limited (of the two); hence he thereby (by standing) gives a\nshoulder-piece to speech, and as well-matched yoke-fellows these two now\nconvey the sacrifice to the gods: for speech, therefore, he sprinkles while\nstanding.\n\n1:4:4:88\\. Now the gods, when they were performing sacrifice, were afraid of a\ndisturbance on the part\n\np. 126\n\nof the Asuras and Rakshas. They, therefore, stood up erect against them on the\nsouth side (of the sacrificial ground); for strength is, as it were, erect;\nhence he makes the (second) libation while standing to the south (of the\nfire). When he makes a libation on each side (of the fire, north and south),\nthis (pair), mind and speech, though indeed joined together, become separate:\nfor one of the two libations is the head of the sacrifice and the other is its\nroot.\n\n1:4:4:99\\. With the dipping-spoon (sruva) he makes that libation which is the\nroot of the sacrifice, and with the offering-spoon (sru _k_ ) that which is\nthe head of the sacrifice.\n\n1:4:4:1010\\. Silently he makes that libation which is the root of the\nsacrifice; for silent, as it were, is this root (of trees &c.), and in it the\nvoice does not sound.\n\n1:4:4:1111\\. With a formula he makes that libation which is the head of the\nsacrifice; for the formula is speech, and from the head this speech sounds.\n\n1:4:4:1212\\. Sitting he makes that libation which is the root of the\nsacrifice; for seated, as it were, is this root. Standing he makes that\nlibation which is the head of the sacrifice; for this head stands, as it were.\n\n1:4:4:1313\\. When he has made the first libation with the dipping-spoon, he\nsays, 'Agnidh, sweep (touch over) the fire 1!' In like manner as one would lay\nthe yoke on (the shoulders of the team), so also he makes that first libation;\nfor after laying on the yoke they fasten (the team to it).\n\n1:4:4:1414\\. He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) then sweeps (the fire with\n\np. 127\n\nthe band of the fire-wood): he thereby harnesses it, thinking, 'Now that it\nhas been harnessed, may it convey the sacrifice to the gods!' for this reason\nhe sweeps it. While sweeping it he moves around, since in harnessing they move\naround the team. He sweeps thrice each time (i.e. thrice along each of the\nthree enclosing-sticks): threefold is the sacrifice.\n\n1:4:4:1515\\. He sweeps (once), with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 7 a), 'O Agni,\nfood-gainer! I cleanse thee, the food-gainer, who art about to hasten to the\nfood!' Whereby he says, 'I cleanse thee who art going to convey the sacrifice\n(to the gods), thee fit for the sacrifice!' He then sweeps thrice over (the\nfire) silently: for just as, after harnessing (the animal), one urges it on,\nsaying, 'Go on! pull!' so does he thereby strike it with the lash\n[1](sbe1221.htm#fn_321), thinking, 'Go on and convey the sacrifice to the\ngods!' That is why he (sweeps) thrice over it silently; and in like manner as\nthis act is performed between (the two sprinklings of butter), so this mind\nand speech, though forming one, thereby become, as it were, separate.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[124:1](sbe1220.htm#fr_320) Viz. the two agharas, or pourings (libations) of\nbutter. The first libation, which belongs to Pra _g_ apati, is made by the\nAdhvaryu, while seated north of the fire, immediately after the commencement\nof the pravara, in a continuous line from west to east, on the north part of\nthe fire. The second libation (cf. note on I, 4, 5, 3) is made by the Adhvaryu\nwhile standing on the south side, in the same way on the southern part of the\nfire. According to some authorities of the Black Ya _g_ us ritual (quoted by\nHillebrandt, Neu and Vollm. pp. 80, 86) the sacrificer pronounces the\nanumantra _n_ as, 'For Pra _g_ apati is this, not for me: thou art the mind of\nPra _g_ apati!' and 'India's voice (speech) art thou: enter into me with the\nvoice, with Indra's power!' over the two libations respectively.\n\n[125:1](sbe1220.htm#fr_321) Upavaha (m.; upavahas, n., Ka _n_ va rec.),\nexplained by Saya _n_ a as a piece of wood inserted under the yoke (and on the\nneck of an ox) in order to make it level with the height of the yoke-fellow.\n\n[126:1](sbe1220.htm#fr_322) See I, 4, 2, 12, with note.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 5.
