Then, on the morrow, there is (used) Gotama\'s Stoma (form of\nchanting) successively increasing by four (verses) 3: the Bahishpavamana\nthereof is on four, the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (stotras) on eight, the Madhyandina Pavamana\non twelve, the P _ri_ sh _th_ a (stotras) on\n\np. 376\n\nsixteen, the \xc3\x82rbhava Pavamana on twenty, and the Agnish _t_ oma-saman on\ntwenty-four (verses).\n\n13:5:1:22\\. Now, some make its Agnish _t_ oma-saman a Saman of four (verses),\nsaying, \'It is neither an Agnish _t_ oma, nor an Ukthya 1.\' If they do so, let\nhire (the Hot _ri_ ),\n\np. 377\n\nafter reciting the Stotriya 1 (strophe) together, recite the Anurupa (strophe)\ntogether: the Rathantara P _ri_ sh _th_ a-saman 2, the _S_ astra containing\nthe Rathantara (text), and the Agnish _t_ oma sacrifice--thereby he makes sure\nof this world.\n\n13:5:1:33\\. \'There are twenty-one Savaniya 3 victims, all of them sacred to\nAgni: for these there is one and the same performance,\' so say some; but,\nindeed, he should immolate two sets of eleven (victims), with the view of his\nobtainment of whatever desired object there may be in (victims) belonging to a\nset of eleven.\n\n13:5:1:44\\. When the Agnish _t_ oma is completed, and the Vasativari water\ncarried round, the Adhvaryu performs the Annahomas 4 (oblations of food): the\nimport of these has been explained. With twelve\n\np. 378\n\n[paragraph continues] Anuvakas (Va _g_. S. XXII, 23-34), \'To the in-breathing\nhail! To the off-breathing hail!\' (he offers)--twelve months are a year, and\nthe year is everything, and the A _s_ vamedha is everything: thus it is for\nhis obtaining and securing everything.\n\n13:5:1:55\\. The central day is an ekavi _m_ _s_ a day 1; for the twenty-one-\nfold is yonder sun, and he is the A _s_ vamedha: by means of his own Stoma he\nthus establishes him in his own deity,--therefore it is an ekavi _m_ _s_ a\nday.\n\n13:5:1:66\\. And, again, as to why it is an ekavi _m_ _s_ a day;--man is\ntwenty-one-fold--ten fingers, ten toes, and the body (self) as the twenty-\nfirst: by means of that twenty-one-fold self he thus establishes him in the\ntwenty-one-fold (day) as on a firm foundation,--therefore it is an ekavi _m_\n_s_ a day.\n\n13:5:1:77\\. And, again, as to why it is an ekavi _m_ _s_ a day;--the ekavi _m_\n_s_ a, assuredly, is the foundation of Stomas, and manifold is that ever-\nvarying performance which takes place on this day,--and it is because he\nthinks that that manifold and ever-varying performance which takes place on\nthis day, shall take place so as to be established on the ekavi _m_ _s_ a as a\nfirm foundation, that this is an ekavi _m_ _s_ a day.\n\n13:5:1:88\\. Now, as to the morning-service of this day. The Hot _ri_ , having\nrecited as the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (hymn 2) in the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti (metre) \'Agni I think on, who\nis good . . .,\' recites thereto the one of a one-day\'s\n\np. 379\n\n[paragraph continues] Soma-sacrifice 1. And the Barhata Prauga and the Madhu\n_kh_ andasa one he recites both together 2 in triplets--(this being done) for\nthe obtainment of the objects of desire which (may be contained) both in the\nBarhata and the Madhu _kh_ andasa Prauga. The morning-service is (thus) set\nright.\n\n13:5:1:99\\. Then as to the midday-service. For the obtainment of the A _s_\nvamedha, the ati _kh_ andas (verse, II, 22, 1), \'In the three troughs the\nbuffalo drank the barley-draught,\' is the opening verse of the Marutvatiya (\n_s_ astra); for outstanding, indeed, is this ati _kh_ andas (hypercatalectic\nverse) amongst metres, and outstanding is the A _s_ vamedha amongst\nsacrifices. This (verse), being recited thrice, amounts to a triplet, and\nthereby he obtains the object of desire which (may be contained) in the\ntriplet. \'Here, O good one, is the pressed plant\' ( _Ri_ g-veda VIII, 2, 1-3)\nis the \'anu _k_ ara\' (sequent triplet): this same (triplet) is the constant\n\np. 380\n\nconnecting link of the one-day\'s sacrifice 1. Having recited both the pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti\n(verses, I, 80, 1-16) \'Here in the Soma-draught alone (the Brahman gave thee\nstrength),\' and the six-footed ones (VIII, 36, 1-7) \'The patron thou art of\nthe offerer of Soma,\' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day\'s\nsacrifice. Thus as to the Marutvatiya (- _s_ astra).\n\n13:5:1:1010\\. Then as to the Nishkevalya (- _s_ astra 2). The Mahanamni\n(verses) are the P _ri_ sh _th_ a (-stotra); and he recites them along with\nthe anurupa (verses) and pragatha (-strophes), for the obtainment of all the\nobjects of his desire, for in the Mahanamnis, as well as in the A _s_ vamedha,\nare contained all objects of desire. Having recited the pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti verses (I, 81,\n1-9) \'Indra hath grown in ebriety and strength,\' and the six-footed ones\n(VIII, 37, 1-7) \'This sacred work didst thou protect in\n\np. 381\n\nfights with V _ri_ tra,\' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day\'s\nsacrifice 1. The midday-service is (thus) set right.\n\n13:5:1:1111\\. Then as to the evening-service. The ati _kh_ andas verse (Va\n_g_. S. IV, 25), \'Unto that god Savit _ri_ within the two bowls (do I sing\npraises 2),\' is the opening verse 3 of the Vai _s_ vadeva(- _s_ astra 4): the\nmystic import thereof is the same as of the former (ati _kh_ andas verse). The\nAnu _k_ ara 5 ( _Ri_ g-veda I, 24, 3-5), \'Unto (abhi) thee, (the lord of\ntreasures), O god Savit _ri_ , (ever helpful we come for our share . . .),\'\ncontains (the word) \'abhi,\' as a form (sign) of victory (abhibhuti). Having\nrecited the Savitra (triplet, VI, 71, 4-6), \'Up rose this god Savit _ri_ , the\nfriend of the house . . .,\' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-\nday\'s sacrifice 6. Having recited the four verses to Heaven and Earth (IV, 56,\n1-4), \'The mighty Heaven and Earth, the most glorious, here . . .,\' he inserts\nthe Nivid in the (hymn I, 159) of the one-day\'s sacrifice. Having recited the\n\xc3\x82rbhava (hymn, IV, 34), \' _Ri_ bhu, Vibhvan, Indra, Va _g_ a, come ye to this\nour sacrifice . . .,\'\n\np. 382\n\nhe inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 111) of the one-day\'s sacrifice. Having\nrecited the (hymn, V, 41) to the All-gods, \'Who is there righteous unto you,\nMitra and Varu _n_ a? . . .,\' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 89) of the\none-day\'s sacrifice. Thus as to the Vai _s_ vadeva (- _s_ astra).\n\n13:5:1:1212\\. Then as to the \xc3\x82gnimaruta 1. Having recited the (hymn, VI, 7) to\n(Agni) Vai _s_ vanara, \'The head of the sky, and the disposer of the earth . .\n.,\' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, III, 3) of the one-day\'s sacrifice.\nHaving recited the (hymn, V, 57) to the Maruts, \'Hither, O Rudras, come ye\nunited with Indra . . .,\' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 87) of the\none-day\'s sacrifice. Having recited the nine verses (VI, 15, 1-9) to _G_\natavedas, \'This guest of yours, the early-waking . . .,\' he inserts the Nivid\nin the (hymn, I, 143) of the one-day\'s sacrifice. And as to why the (hymns) of\nthe one-day\'s sacrifice are used for inserting the Nivid, it is for the sake\nof his (the Sacrificer\'s) not being deprived of a firm foundation, for the _G_\nyotish _t_ oma is a foundation.\n\n13:5:1:1313\\. For this (day) there are those sacrificial animals--\'A horse, a\nhornless he-goat, and a Gom _ri_ ga 2,\' fifteen \'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gyas\': the mystic\nimport of these has been explained. Then these wild ones--for spring he seizes\n(three) kapi _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ alas 3, for summer sparrows, for the rainy season\npartridges: of these\n\np. 383\n\n(wild animals) also (the mystic import) has been told 1.\n\n13:5:1:1414\\. Then those (victims) for the twenty-one (stakes). He seizes\ntwenty-one animals for each of the (eleven) deities of the Seasonal offerings\n2; for as many as there are gods of the Seasonal offerings so many are all the\ngods; and all objects of desire are in the A _s_ vamedha: \'by gratifying all\nthe deities I shall gain all my desires,\' so he thinks. But let him not\nproceed in this way.\n\n13:5:1:1515\\. Let him seize seventeen victims for the central stake 3, in\norder that he may gain and secure every-thing,\n\np. 384\n\nfor the seventeenfold is Pra _g_ apati, and the seventeenfold (stoma) is\neverything, and the A _s_ vamedha is everything;--and sixteen at each of the\nother (stakes) in order that he may gain and secure everything, for everything\nhere consists of sixteen parts, and the A _s_ vamedha is everything. Thirteen\nwild (beasts) he seizes for each intermediate space, in order that he may gain\nand secure everything, for the year consists of thirteen months, and the A _s_\nvamedha is everything.\n\n13:5:1:1616\\. Now, prior to the (chanting of the) Bahishpavamana, they (the\nassistants of the Adhvaryu) bring up the horse, after cleansing it; and with\nit they glide along for the Pavamana: the mystic import of this has been\nexplained 1. When the Bahishpavamana has been chanted, they make the horse\nstep on the place of chanting: if it sniffs, or turns away, let him know that\nhis sacrifice is successful. Having led up that (horse), the Adhvaryu says,\n\'Hot _ri_ , sing praises!\' and the Hot _ri_ sings its praises 2 with eleven\n(verses, _Ri_ g-veda I, 163, 1-11)--\n\n13:5:1:1717\\. \'When, first born, thou didst neigh . . .\'--thrice (he praises)\nwith the first, and thrice with the last (verse), these amount to fifteen,--\nfifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: with that\nthunderbolt, vigour, the Sacrificer thus from the very first repels evil: thus\n3, indeed, it is to the Sacrificer that the thunderbolt is given in\n\np. 385\n\norder to smite for him whoever is to be smitten.--[ _Ri_ g-veda I, 163, 12.\n13], The swift racer hath gone forward to the slaying. . . .\'--\'The racer hath\ngone forward to the highest place. . .\'--\n\n13:5:1:1818\\. Having omitted these two (verses), he inserts the hymn (I, 162),\n\'Never (shall forget us) Mitra, Varu _n_ a, Aryaman, \xc3\x82yu . . .,\' in the\nAdhrigu 1 (litany). Some, however, insert this verse (I, 162, 18), \'Thirty-\nfour (ribs) of the steed, akin to the gods, (doth the knife hit) . . .,\'\nbefore the (passage,--\'twenty-six are its) ribs,\' thinking lest they should\nplace the holy syllable \'om\' in the wrong place 2, or lest they should suggest\nthe plural by a singular 3. Let him not proceed thus, but let him insert the\nhymn as a whole.--\'The swift racer hath gone forward to the slaying . .\n.\'--\'The racer hath gone forward to the highest place . . .\'--\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[375:1](sbe44105.htm#fr_979) \'From natural fissures and incisions made in the\nbark (of Butea frondosa) issues during the hot season a red juice, which soon\nhardens into a ruby-coloured, brittle, astringent gum, similar to kino, and\nsold as Bengal kino.\' Stewart and Brandis.\n\n[375:2](sbe44105.htm#fr_980) See [p. 331](sbe44095.htm#page_331), note\n[1](sbe44095.htm#fn_840).\n\n[375:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_981) Regarding the _K_ atush _t_ oma, see [p.\n329](sbe44094.htm#page_329), note [1](sbe44094.htm#fn_836).\n\n[376:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_982) According to the practice here referred to, the\nAgnish _t_ omasaman would not consist merely of the one triplet (usually\nSamav. II, 53-4 i.e. the so-called ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya triplet)\nordinarily used for it, but of four different Samans, inasmuch as three of the\ntriplets which may be used for the Uktha-stotras (of the Ukthya and other\nsacrifices) are added to that ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya triplet. In that\ncase, however, the latter is not chanted to its own \'ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\niya\' tune, but the Varavantiya tune is used for all the four triplets. This\npractice is somewhat vaguely referred to in Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Br. XIX, 5, 10-11.\n\'One Saman (tune), many metres (texts): therefore one (man) feeds many\ncreatures. Verily, the Agnish _t_ oma (saman) is the self, and the metres\n(hymn-texts) are cattle: he thus secures cattle for his own self. It is\nneither an Ukthya nor an Agnish _t_ oma (sacrifice), for cattle are neither\n(entirely) domestic nor wild (viz. because though kept "in the village," they\nalso freely graze "in the forest").\' Here the passage \'One Saman, many\nmetres,\' according to the commentary, refers to the Varavantiya tune as being\nemployed, on this occasion, for the texts of the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya,\nthe Sakama _s_ va (II, 55-57, here the Calc. ed., by mistake, calls the second\ntune figured for chanting, like the first, Sakama _s_ va, instead of\nVaravantiya), the Saubhara (II, 230-2, where the Calc. ed., by mistake, omits\nthe name Varavantiya), and the Taira _s_ _k_ a (II, 233-5; curiously enough,\nthe Taira _s_ _k_ a is not mentioned, in La _t_ y. Sr. VIII, 9-10, amongst the\nSamans that may be used for the third--or the A _k_ _kh_ avaka\'s--Uktha, but\nSaya _n_ a, on Samav. II, 233, states distinctly, \'taira _s_ _k_ a _m_ t _ri_\ntiyam uktham\'). Whilst, as Uktha-stotras, the last three texts would usually\nhe chanted in the ekavi _m_ _s_ a, or twenty-one-versed form, in the present\ninstance, as part of the _k_ atush _t_ oma, they would be chanted (along with\nthe Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya) in the twenty-four-versed form. Thus, though\nan Agnish _t_ oma sacrifice, inasmuch as it has twelve stotras, yet it is not\na regular one; neither is it an Ukthya, because the Ukthas are not chanted as\nso many Stotras, followed by the recitation of separate Sastras. In the \xc3\x82 _s_\nv. _S_ r. X, 6, different alternatives are proposed for the chanting of the\nAgnish _t_ oma-saman p. 377 in the \'Gotamastoma (i.e. _K_ atush _t_ oma)\nantarukthya\' and the corresponding Sastra, including apparently the employment\nof the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya-saman either for all the four triplets, or\nfor the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya triplet alone with the respective Samans\nused for the other triplets; different modes of recitation being thereby\nimplied with regard to the Stotriya and Anurupa pragathas.\n\n[377:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_983) For the \xc3\x82gnimaruta- _s_ astra, recited by the Hot\n_ri_ after the chanting of the Agnish _t_ oma-saman, and containing, amongst\nvarious hymns and detached verses, the triplet which forms the text of the\nStotra, i.e. the \'Stotriya pragatha,\' as well as a corresponding antistrophe,\nthe \'Anurupa pragatha,\' see part ii, p. 369 note. On the present occasion,\nhowever, this constituent element of the Sastra would have to include the\ntriplets of all the four Samans, as well as four \'antistrophes\' which are thus\n\'recited together.\'\n\n[377:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_984) Or, P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra, viz. the first\nstotra of that name at the midday-service, for which that Saman is used in the\nAgnish _t_ oma sacrifice (part ii, p. 339, note 2).\n\n[377:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_985) That is, victims sacrificed on the Sutyas, or\nSoma-days. Two complete sets of eleven such victims are, however, required on\neach of the three days, see [p. 309](sbe44087.htm#page_309), note\n[2](sbe44087.htm#fn_787).\n\n[377:4](sbe44106.htm#fr_986) See [XIII, 2, 1, 1](sbe44083.htm#13:2:1:1) seqq.,\nand [p. 297](sbe44083.htm#page_297), note [1](sbe44083.htm#fn_747).\n\n[378:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_987) That is one on which all Stotras are chanted in\nthe \'ekavi _m_ _s_ a\' Stoma, or twenty-one-versed hymn-form.\n\n[378:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_988) Viz. _Ri_ g-veda V, 6, forming the special\nfeature of the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya _s_ astra at the A _s_ vamedha.\n\n[379:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_989) Viz. the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya-sukta, _Ri_ g-veda III, 13,\nforming the chief part of the Hot _ri_ \'s \xc3\x82 _g_ ya- _s_ astra, or first _S_\nastra of the Agnish _t_ oma, for which see part ii, p. 327 note.\n\n[379:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_990) The Barhata Prauga, or Prauga- _s_ astra in the B\n_ri_ hati metre,--being the one recited on the fifth day of the P _ri_ sh _th_\nya-sha _d_ aha (\xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. VII, 12, 7), and consisting of the seven\ndifferent triplets, addressed to as many different deities,--is to be recited\nalso on this occasion; and along with it (or rather, intertwined with it,\ntriplet by triplet) the ordinary Prauga- _s_ astra of the Agnish _t_ oma, made\nup of the two hymns Rig-veda I, 2 and 3 which are ascribed to Madhu _kh_\nandas, and consist of nine and twelve verses, or together seven triplets. I do\nnot understand why Harisvamin mentions \'Vayur agrega _h_ \' (? Va _g_. S.\nXXVII, 31) as being the first triplet of the Madhu _kh_ andasa Prauga, instead\nof I, 2, 1-3 \'vayav a yahi dar _s_ ata.\' The Prauga is the Hot _ri_ \'s second\n_S_ astra of the morning-service, being preceded by the chanting of the first\n\xc3\x82 _g_ ya-stotra; see part ii, p. 325.\n\n[380:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_991) See part ii, p. 337, where the same triplet forms\nthe anu _k_ ara of this Sastra at the Agnish _t_ oma. It is followed there by\nthe Pragathas VIII, 53, 5-6; I, 40, 5-6 (read thus! each two counting as one\ntriplet); three Dhayya verses, and the Marutvatiya Pragathas VIII, 89, 3-4\n(!), These are to be followed up, on the present occasion, by the two hymns I,\n80, and VIII, 36, after which the Indra hymn X, 73, the chief part of the\nnormal Marutvatiya Sastra, is to be recited, with the Nivid formula inserted\nafter the sixth verse.\n\n[380:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_992) That is, the _S_ astra succeeding the chanting of\nthe first, or Hot _ri_ \'s, P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra (see part ii, p. 339).\nWhilst, however, in the one-day\'s sacrifice, the Rathantara (or the B _ri_\nhat) saman is used for that stotra, the Mahanamni verses (see part iii,\nintrod. p. xx, note 2), with the Sakvara tune, are to be used as the Stotriyas\non this occasion, and are therefore likewise to be recited by the Hot _ri_ as\nStotriya-pragathas (cf. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. VII, 12, 10 seqq.), to be followed up by the\nantistrophe (anurupa)--here consisting of the triplets I, 84, 10-12; VIII, 93,\n31-3; I, 11, 1-3--and the Sama-pragatha, VIII, 3, 1-2.\n\n[381:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_993) Viz. after the eighth verse of the hymn _Ri_\ng-veda I, 32, the chief part of the normal Nishkevalya- _s_ astra.\n\n[381:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_994) For the complete verse see III, 3, 2, 1 2.\n\n[381:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_995) This verse is again recited thrice, and thus\ntakes the place of the ordinary opening triplet.\n\n[381:4](sbe44106.htm#fr_996) For this _S_ astra, recited after the \xc3\x82rbhava-\nPavamana-stotra, see part ii, p. 361.\n\n[381:5](sbe44106.htm#fr_997) \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. X, 10, 6 prescribes the ordinary\nanu _k_ ara V, 82, 4-7; whence Saya _n_ a on I, 24, 3 (-5) offers no\nindication of the ritualistic use of that triplet on this occasion.\n\n[381:6](sbe44106.htm#fr_998) Viz. IV, 54, before the last verse of which the\nNivid is inserted.\n\n[382:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_999) Viz. the final Sastra of the evening-service,\npreceded by the chanting of the Agnish _t_ oma-saman; see part ii, p. 369.\n\n[382:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_1000) See [p. 298](sbe44083.htm#page_298), note\n[4](sbe44084.htm#fn_753); [p. 338](sbe44097.htm#page_338), note\n[1](sbe44097.htm#fn_859).\n\n[382:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_1001) The \'Kapi _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ala\' is a kind of wildfowl,\napparently of the quail or partridge species--a hazel-cock, or francoline\npartridge. Some of the later authorities, however, identify it with the \' _k_\nataka\' p. 383 (\'cuculus melanoleucus\'). With regard to some of the wild\nanimals referred to in the corresponding section of the Va _g_. S., the\ncommentator Mahidhara significantly remarks (Va _g_. S. XXIV, 29; cf. Katy.\nXX, 6, 6 scholl.) that the meaning of such names as are not understood must be\nmade out with the help of quotations (nigama), Vedic vocabularies (nigha _n_\n_t_ u) and their comments (nirukta), grammar (vyakara _n_ a), the Unadiv _ri_\ntti, and dictionaries.\n\n[383:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_1002) Viz. XIII, 2, 4, 1 seqq. It is not easy to see\nwhy the text should break off abruptly with the birds representing the rainy\nseason. For autumn there are to be (three) quails, for winter \'kakara,\' and\nfor the dewy season \'vikakara.\' Then follow, to the end of the 260 wild\nanimals, a long series of divinities to each of which (or sometimes to allied\ndeities) three animals are consigned. Thirteen of these wild animals are\nplaced on each of the twenty spaces between the twenty-one stakes.\n\n[383:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_1003) Or, perhaps, for the (eleven) deities of the\nSeasonal offerings he seizes twenty-one animals for each (stake); which would\ncertainly simplify the distribution of those animals. Regarding the victims\nactually consecrated to the deities of the _K_ aturmasya offerings, see [p.\n309](sbe44087.htm#page_309), note [2](sbe44087.htm#fn_787).\n\n[383:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_1004) This does not include the twelve \'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gyas\'\ntied to the horse\'s limbs, but only the horse and two other victims sacred to\nPra _g_ apati, and twelve of a long series of beasts, of which three are\ndedicated to each successive deity (or allied group of deities). To these are\nafterwards added Agni\'s two victims belonging to the two sets of eleven\nvictims (of the other twenty of which one is assigned to each of the other\nstakes).\n\n[384:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_1005) [XIII, 2, 3, 1](sbe44085.htm#13:2:3:1).\n\n[384:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_1006) The mode of recitation is similar to that of the\nkindling-verses (likewise eleven, brought up, by _r_ epetitions of the first\nand last, to fifteen), viz. by making a pause after each half-verse, but\nwithout adding the syllable \'om\' thereto. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. X, 8, 5.\n\n[384:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_1007) Harisvamin explains \'tad vai\' as standing for\n\'sa vai\' (li\xe1\xb9\x85gavyatyayena)--viz. that fifteenfold thunderbolt.\n\n[385:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_1008) On this recitation, consisting of a lengthy set\nof formulas, addressed to the slaughterers, see part ii, p, 188, note 2. The\nwhole of the formulas are given Ait. Br. II, 6-7. The hymn, according to \xc3\x82 _s_\nv. X, 8, 7; is to be inserted either before the last formula of the litany, or\nsomewhat further back--viz. before the formula \'sha _d_ vi _m_ _s_ atir asya\nva\xe1\xb9\x85krayas,\' \'twenty-six are its ribs\'--whilst our Brahma _n_ a rather allows\nthe alternative of the eighteenth verse of I, 162 being inserted at the latter\nplace,--unless, indeed, the insertion in that case is to be made immediately\nbefore the word \'va\xe1\xb9\x85kraya _h_ \' which is scarcely likely.\n\n[385:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_1009) Harisvamin seems to take this to mean that as\nthis verse is of the same nature as the formulas of the Adhrigu litany, he is\nto treat it as such, as otherwise, in reciting he would have to pronounce \'om\'\nafter that verse, which is not done after those formulas.\n\n[385:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_1010) Or, the plurality by the individual. Owing to\nthe corrupt state of the MS., the commentator\'s explanation of this passage is\nnot clear. He seems, however, at any rate, to take the \'plural\' to refer to\nthe formula \'sha _d_ vi _m_ _s_ atir asya va\xe1\xb9\x85krayas,\' where apparently \'esham\'\nhas to be substituted for \'asya\' on this occasion, as many victims are\nimmolated, and the ribs of a plurality of beasts are thus indicated, whilst in\nverse eighteen of the hymn, on the p. 386 contrary, only the ribs of one horse\n(thus forming a kind of unit) are referred to; and if that verse were recited,\nalong with the whole hymn, before the final formula which refers to all the\nvictims, the necessary connection would be interrupted.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 5, 2.
