[1b](ry003.htm#fn_3)  \nThe Prince of Hermits is the parent mount,  \n   The lordly Rama is the darling sea.  \n\nGlory to him whose fame is ever bright!  \n   Glory to him, Prachetas'  [2b](ry003.htm#fn_4) holy son!  \nWhose pure lips quaff with ever new delight  \n   The nectar-sea of deeds by Rama done.  \n\nHail, arch-ascetic, pious, good, and kind!  \n   Hail, Saint Valmiki, lord of every lore!  \nHail, holy Hermit, calm and pure of mind!  \n   Hail, First of Bards, Valmiki, hail once more!  \n  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](ry001.htm#fr_0) The MSS. vary very considerably in these stanzas of\ninvocation: many lines are generally prefixed in which not only the poet, but\nthose who play the chief parts in the poem are panegyrized. It is self-\napparent that they are not by the author of the Ramayan himself.\n\n[1:2](ry001.htm#fr_1) 'Valmiki was the son of Varuna, the regent of the\nwaters, one of whose names is Prachetas. According to the _Adhy atma\nRamayana_, the sage, although a Brahman by birth, associated with foresters\nand robbers. Attacking on one occasion the seven Rishis, they expostulated\nwith him successfully, and taught him the _mantra_ of Rama reversed, or _Mar\na_, _Mar a_, in the inaudible repetition of which he remained immovable for\nthousands of years, so that when the sages returned to the same spot they\nfound him still there, converted into a _valmik_ or ant-hill, by the nests of\nthe termites, whence his name of Valmiki.'\n\nWILSON. _Specimens of the Hindu Theatre, Vol. I. p_. 313.\n\n'Valmiki is said to have lived a solitary life in the woods: he is called both\na _muni_ and a _rishi_. The former word properly signifies an anchorite or\nhermit; the latter has reference chiefly to wisdom. The two words are\nfrequently used promiscuously, and may both be rendered by the Latin _cates_\nin its earliest meaning of _seer_ : Valmiki was both poet and seer, as he is\nsaid to have sung the exploits of Rama by the aid of divining insight rather\nthan of knowledge naturally acquired.' SCHLEGEL.\n\n[1:3](ry001.htm#fr_2) Literally, _Kokila_ , the Koil, or Indian Cuckoo.\nSchlegel translates 'luscinium.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book I](ry002.htm)\n\n"
