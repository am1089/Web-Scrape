(P\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab) the earth is His body; though He pervades the earth, it does\nnot know Him. The waters are His body; though He pervades the waters, they do\nnot know Him. Agni is His body; though He pervades agni, it does not know Him.\nV\xc4\x81yu is His body; though He pervades v\xc4\x81yu, it does not know Him. \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b is His\nbody; though He pervades \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, it does not know Him. Manas is His body; though\nHe pervades manas, it does not know Him. Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is His body; though He\npervades bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, it does not know Him. Aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra is His body; though He\npervades aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra, it does not know Him. Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada is His body; though He\npervades chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, it does not know Him. Avyak\xe1\xb9\xada is His body; though He pervades\navyak\xe1\xb9\xada, it does not know Him. Akshara is His body; though He pervades\nakshara, it does not know Him. M\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadyu is His body; though He pervades m\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadyu, it\ndoes not know Him. He who is the inner soul of all creatures and the purifier\nof sins, is the one divine Lord N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\nThe wise should through the practice of deep meditation of Brahman leave off\nthe (recurrent) conception of "I" and mine" in the body and the senses which\nare other than \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Having known himself as Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, the witness of\nbu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi and its actions, one should ever think "So\'ham" ("I am That") and leave\noff the idea of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 in all others. Shunning the pursuits of the world, the\nbody and the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras, set about removing the false attribution of self. In the\ncase of a Yogin staying always in his own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, his mind parishes having known\nhis \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 of all, through inference, Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das\n\np. 56\n\nand self-experience. Never giving the slightest scope to sleep, worldly talk,\nsounds, etc., think of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, (in yourself) to be the (supreme) \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Shun at a\ndistance like a cha\xe1\xb9\x85d\xc4\x81la (the thought of) the body, which is generated out of\nthe impurities of parents and is composed of excreta and flesh. Then you will\nbecome Brahman and be (in a) blessed (state). O Sage, having dissolved (J\xc4\xabva-)\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 into Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 with the thought of its being partless, like the ether of\na jar in the universal ether, be ever in a state of taciturnity. Having become\nthat which is the seat of all \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81s and the self-resplendent, give up the\nmacrocosm and microcosm like an impure vessel. Having merged into Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81,\nwhich is ever blissful, the conception of "I" which is rooted in the body, and\nhaving removed the (conception of) Li\xe1\xb9\x85ga (here the sign of separateness),\nbecome ever the Kevala (alone). Having known "I am that Brahman" in which\nalone the universe appears like a town in a mirror, become one that has\nperformed (all) his duty, O sinless one. The ever-blissful and the self-\neffulgent One being freed from the grip of aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra attains its own state,\nlike the spotless moon becoming full (after eclipse).\n\nWith the extinction of actions, there arises the extinction of chin\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81. From it\narises the decay of v\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s; and from the latter, arises moksha; and this is\ncalled J\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xadi. Looking upon everything in all places and times as Brahman\nbrings about the destruction of v\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s through the force of v\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s of\ns\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvic nature. Carelessness in Brahmanishth\xc4\x81 by (or meditation of Brahman)\nshould not in the least be allowed (to creep in). Knowers of Brahman style\n(this) carelessness, in Br\xc4\x81hmic science, as death (itself). Just as the moss\n(momentarily) displaced (in a tank) again resumes its original position, in a\nminute, so M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 envelops even the wise, should they be careless (even for a\nmoment). He who attains the Kaivalya state during life becomes a Kevala even\nafter death of his body. Ever devoted to sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, become a nirvikalpa (or the\nchangeless one), O sinless. one. The gran\xe1\xb9\xadhi (or knot) of the heart, full of\naj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, is broken completely only when one sees his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as secondless through\nnirvikalpa sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi.\n\np. 57\n\nNow, having strengthened the conception of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and well given up that of "I"\nin the body, one should be indifferent as he would be towards jars, cloth,\netc. From Brahma down to a pillar, all the up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhis are only unreal. Hence one\nshould see (or cognize) his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as all-full and existing by itself (alone).\nBrahma is Swayam (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81); Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u is \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81; Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra is: \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma; In\xe1\xb8\x8dra is \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81; all\nthis universe is \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and there is nothing but \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. By expelling (from the\nmind) without any remainder all objects which are superimposed on one\'s \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81,\none becomes himself Parabrahman the full, the secondless and the actionless.\nHow can there be the heterogeneity of the universe of sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa and vikalpa in\nthat One Principle which is immutable, formless and homogeneous? When there is\nno difference between the seer, the seen, and sight, there being the decayless\nand Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, full like the ocean at the end of a Kalpa and effulgent, all\ndarkness, the cause of false perception, merges in it. How can there be\nheterogeneity in that one supreme Principle which is alike? How can there be\nheterogeneity in the highest \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva which is One? Who has observed any\nheterogeneity in sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi (the dreamless sleep), where there is happiness\nonly? This vikalpa has its root in chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada only. When chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada is not, there is\nnothing. Therefore unite the chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada with Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadman in its Pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81g\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadmic state.\nIf one knows \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as unbroken bliss in itself, then he drinks always the juice\n(or essence) of bliss in his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, whether internally or externally.\n\nThe fruit of vair\xc4\x81gya is bo\xe1\xb8\x8dha (spiritual wisdom); the fruit of bo\xe1\xb8\x8dha is\nupara\xe1\xb9\xadi (renunciation); \xc5\x9b\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadi (sweet patience) is attained out of the\nenjoyment of the bliss of one\'s Ming, and this \xc5\x9b\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadi is the fruit of upara\xe1\xb9\xadi.\nIf the latter in each of these is absent, the former is useless. Niv\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi (or\nthe return path) leads to the highest contentment and (spiritual) bliss is\nsaid to be beyond all analogy. That which has M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 as its up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is the womb\nof the world; that true one which has the attribute of omniscience, etc., and\nhas the variegated mystery is denoted by the word "\xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad" (that). That is called\nApara (the other or inferior) which shines through meditation upon the idea\nand the\n\np. 58\n\nworld asma\xe1\xb9\xad 1 and the consciousness of which is developed by anta\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a. By\nseparating the up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhis M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 and avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 from Para and J\xc4\xabva (cosmic and human\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81s respectively), one realises Parabrahman which is partless and\nSachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da. Making the mind dwell upon such sentences (or ideas) as the\nabove constitutes \xc5\x9brava\xe1\xb9\x87a (hearing). It becomes manana (contemplation) when\nsuch ideas are quieted (in one) through logical reasoning. When (their)\nmeaning is confirmed through these (two processes), the concentration of the\nmind on it alone constitutes ni\xe1\xb8\x8di\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81sana. That is called sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi in which the\nchi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, rising above the conception of the contemplator and contemplation,\nmerges gradually into the contemplated, like a light undisturbed by the wind.\nEven the mental states are not known (at the time when one is within the scope\nof \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81). But they are only inferred from the recollection which takes place\nafter sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. Through this sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi are destroyed crores of karmas which have\naccumulated during cycles of births without beginning and pure \xe1\xb8\x8dharma is\ndeveloped. Knowers of Yoga call this sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, \xe1\xb8\x8dharma-megha (cloud), inasmuch\nas it showers nectarine drops of karma in great quantities, when all the hosts\nof v\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s are destroyed entirely through this, and when the accumulated\nkarmas, virtuous and sinful, are rooted out. Then that in which speech was\nhidden till now, appears no longer so, and shines as Sa\xe1\xb9\xad; and direct cognition\nreveals itself, like the myrobalan in the palm of the hand. Vair\xc4\x81gya begins\nfrom where the v\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s cease to arise towards objects of enjoyment. The\ncessation of the rising of the idea of "I" is the highest limit of bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi;\nupara\xe1\xb9\xadi begins from where the mental states once destroyed do not again arise.\nThat ascetic is said to possess S\xe1\xb9\xadhi\xe1\xb9\xadapraj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81 who enjoys bliss always and whose\nmind is absorbed in Brahman that is formless and actionless. That state of\nmind is termed praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81 that realises the oneness of Brahman and \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 after deep\ninquiry, and that has the v\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi of nirvikalpa and chinm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadra. He who possesses\nthis always is a Jivanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada. He is a Jivanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada who has, neither the\nconception of "I" in the body and the senses, nor\n\np. 59\n\nthe conception of another (different from himself) in everything else. He is a\nJivanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada who sees through his praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81 no difference between his own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and\nBrahman as well as between Brahman and the universe. He is a Jivanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada who\npreserves equanimity of mind, either when revered by the good or reviled by\nthe vicious. One who has cognized the true nature of Brahman is not subject to\nrebirth as before. But were he so subjected, then he is not a true knower, the\nknowing of Brahman being external only. A man is subject to pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha 1 so\nlong as he is affected by pleasure, etc. The attainment of a result is always\npreceded by action; and nowhere is it without karma. Through the cognition "I\nam Brahman" are destroyed the karmas accumulated during hundreds of crores of\nprevious births, like the actions in the dreaming state (that are destroyed)\nduring the waking state.\n\nAn ascetic having known himself as associateless and indifferent like ether,\nis not at all affected by any of his karmas at any time. Just as the ether is\nnot affected by the alcoholic smell through its contact with a pot, so \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is\nnot affected by the gu\xe1\xb9\x87as produced by its up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. The pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha karma that has\nbegun to act before the dawn of j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is not checked by it; and one should\nreap its fruit, as in the case of an arrow discharged at a target. An arrow\nthat is discharged towards an object with the idea that it is a tiger, does\nnot stop when it (the tiger) is found to be a cow; but it (even) pierces the\nmark through its speed, without stopping. When one realises his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as free\nfrom old age and death, then how will pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha affect him? Pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha\naccomplishes (its work) only when one considers his body as At ma. This\nconception of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as body is not at all a desirable one; so it should be\ngiven up along with pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha, since it is simply a delusion to attribute\npr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha to this body. How can there be reality to that which is superimposed\nupon another? How can there be birth to that which is not real? How can there\nbe death to that which is not born? How can there be pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha to that which\nis unreal? The Ve\xe1\xb8\x8da speaks of pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha in an external sense only, to satisfy\nthose\n\np. 60\n\nfoolish persons that doubt, saying: "If j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na can destroy all the results of\naj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na (such as body, etc.), then whence is the existence of this body to such\na one?" but not to inculcate to the wise the existence of the body.\n\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is all-full, beginningless, endless, immeasurable, unchangeable, replete\nwith Sa\xe1\xb9\xad, Chi\xe1\xb9\xad, and \xc4\x80nan\xe1\xb8\x8da, decayless, the one essence, the eternal, the\ndifferentiated, the plenum, the endless, having its face everywhere, the one\nthat can neither be given up nor taken up, the one that can neither be\nsupported nor be made to support, the gu\xe1\xb9\x87aless, the actionless, the subtle,\nthe changeless, the stainless, the indescribable, the true nature of one\'s\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, above the reach of speech and mind, the one full of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad, the self-\nexistent, the immaculate, the enlightened, and the incomparable; such is\nBrahman, one only without a second. There are not in the least many. He who\nknows his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 himself through his own cognition, as the one who is not\nrestricted by any, is a Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha (one that has accomplished his object), who has\nidentified his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 with the one changeless \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Whither is this world gone,\nthen? How did it appear? Where is it absorbed? It was seen by me just now, but\nnow it is gone. What a great miracle! What is fit to be taken in? and what to\nbe rejected? What is other (than \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81)? And what is different (from It)? In\nthis mighty ocean of Brahman full of the nectar of undivided bliss, I do not\nsee, hear, or know anything. I remain in my \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 only and in my own nature of\nSa\xe1\xb9\xad, \xc4\x80nan\xe1\xb8\x8dar\xc5\xabpa. I am an asa\xe1\xb9\x85ga (or the associateless). I am an asa\xe1\xb9\x85ga. I am\nwithout any attributes. I am Hari (the Lord taking away sin). I am the\nquiescent, the endless, the all-full and the ancient. I am neither the agent\nnor the enjoyer.\n\nI am the changeless and the decayless. I am of the nature of pure\nenlightenment. I am the one and the perpetual bliss.\n\nThis science was imparted to Ap\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadara\xe1\xb9\xadama who gave it to Brahma,. Brahma gave\nit to Ghora-A\xe1\xb9\x85giras. Ghora-A\xe1\xb9\x85giras gave it to Raikva, who gave it to R\xc4\x81ma. And\nR\xc4\x81ma gave it to all beings. This is the teaching of Nirv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a; and this is the\nteaching of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das; yea, this is the teaching of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das.
