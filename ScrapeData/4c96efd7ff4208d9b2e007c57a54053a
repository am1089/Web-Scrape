Suttrajeet charged Shree Krishnu Chund\nfirst with the theft of a jewel; and afterwards, finding his accusation to be\nfalse, he was ashamed, and gave his daughter Sutbhama in marriage to Huri.\nRaja Pureechit enquired from Shree Shookdeo Jee, "O abode of compassion! who\nwas Suttrajeet, where did he obtain the jewel, and how did he accuse Huri of\ntheft, and afterwards finding the charge false, in what manner did he give his\ndaughter in marriage; explain these circumstances to me?" Shree Shookdeo Jee\nreplied,--O great king! be pleased to listen, and I will explain all the\ncircumstances. Suttrajeet belonged to the family of Judoo, who for a long time\nwas engaged in an act of very difficult religious penance in honour of the\nsun. The sun-god was highly gratified, called him and having given him a\njewel, said, "This jewel\'s name is Soomuntka, it contains an unbounded power\nof conferring happiness and wealth; Worship it continually, and look upon it\nas equal to me in power and splendour; if you meditate upon it, having offered\nup prayers, and performed acts of penance, abstinence and fasting, you shall\nobtain whatever you ask for; into whatever country, city and house this jewel\nshall enter, there misery, poverty and\n\np. 243\n\ndeath shall not have access. There shall be constant plenty and increase, and\nprosperity."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken the sun-god allowed Suttrajeet to take leave;\nwho went home with the jewel. After this, rising, early and performing his\nmorning ablutions, and finishing his religious meditations and libations, he\nwas in the habit of offering adoration to the jewel, with unbroken rice,\nflowers, sandal, perfumes, lamps and consecrated food; and taking away the\neight loads of gold, which came from the jewel, he was delighted.\n\nOne day whilst engaged in worship, beholding the beauty and brilliancy of the\njewel, he thought to himself,--"It will be a good act to take this jewel and\nshow it to Shree Krishnu Chund." Having come to this resolution, and fastening\nthe jewel on his arm, Suttrajeet went to the court of the descendants of\nJudoo. On seeing the brilliancy of the jewel from a distance, the descendants\nof Judoo stood still with admiration, and began to say to Shree Krishnu Jee,\n"O great king! the sun is coming here from a longing desire to see you.\nBrahma, Roodru, Indru and all the gods worship you; and meditating upon you\nduring the eight puhurs, sing of your celebrity. You are the immortal first\nmale, Vishnu, Luchmee has become your servant, and constantly waits upon you.\nYou are the god of all the gods. No one knows your nature. Your attributes and\nqualities of mind are limitless; now, O lord I will you be concealed, having\ncome into the world?"\n\nO great king! when the descendants of Judoo began to discourse thus, on seeing\nSuttrajeet approach, Huri said, "This is not the sun; it is Suttrajeet, one of\nthe family of Judoo, who has obtained a jewel for having performed an act of\npenance in honour of the sun. Its splendour is equal to that of the sun. He is\ncoming with that jewel, fastened on his arm."\n\nO great king! whilst Shree Krishnu Jee was thus speaking, Suttrajeet came and\nsat down in the court, where the descendants of Judoo were playing at "\n_choupur_ " and dice. The. minds\n\np. 244\n\nof all were fascinated by beholding the brilliant lustre of the jewels, and\nShree Krishnu Chund remained also looking at it. Suttrajeet, then, upon\nsomething occurring to his mind, took leave, and returned home; and afterwards\nused constantly to come to the court with the jewel fastened about his neck.\nOne day, the descendants of Judoo said to Huri, "O great king! take the jewel\nfrom Suttrajeet, and give it to Raja Oogursen and obtain celebrity in the\nworld. This jewel does not suit him, but is fit for a Raja."\n\nOn hearing this, Shree Krishnu Jee smilingly said to Suttrajeet, "Give this\njewel to the Raja, and acquire for yourself a great name and reputation in the\nworld." On hearing this proposal to give the jewel away, he made an obeisance,\nand rose up; and, engaged in thought, went to his brother, and said, "Shree\nKrishnu Jee asked me for the jewel to-day, and I did not give it him." When\nSuttrajeet had thus spoken, his brother, Pursen, was angry, and took the\njewel, and threw it on his own neck; and arming himself, and mounting a horse,\nwent out hunting. Having gone into an extensive forest, he began to kill\nvarious kinds of deer and antelopes with his bow and arrows. A deer having\nrushed out before him, he was enraged, and pursued it on horseback; and in the\ncourse of the pursuit came alone to a large deep cave, which had existed for\nages. On hearing the sound of the deer and horse\'s feet, a lion came forth\nfrom the cave; and killing all three, and carrying off the jewel, went into\nhis cave again. The light was so great in consequence of the jewel coming into\nthe cave, that its rays extended to the infernal regions. A bear, named\nJamwunt, that had been with Shree Ramchund in the descent of Ram upon the\nearth, and had since the Treta age dwelt in the regions below with all his\nfamily, seeing that shining light in the cave, rose up; and pursuing his\njourney came to the lion. Having killed the lion, he carried off the jewel,\nand went with it to his wife who fastened it in her daughter\'s cradle. The\nchild constantly played and amused herself with the\n\np. 245\n\njewel, which filled their abode with a perpetual stream of light.\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! the jewel\nwas thus lost, and such was the fate of Pursen. The people, who had\naccompanied Pursen, came and said to Suttrajeet, "O great king! he left us,\nand went off alone, and we have found no trace of where he went. They searched\nagain in consequence of their statements not being believed, but could not\nfind Pursen any where in the forest."\n\nOn hearing this statement, Suttrajeet abstained from all food and drink; and\nbeing greatly depressed and troubled in mind began to say to himself, "This is\nShree Krishnu\'s doing, he has killed my brother for the sake of the jewel, and\nhas carried off the jewel to his own home. First of all he asked me for it;\nbut I did not give it, and he has thus carried it off." With these thoughts,\nhe passed his time in great anxiety. One night, he was sitting on his wife\'s\nbed, emaciated, low-spirited, silent and deeply engaged in thought, when his\nwife said to him, "Why are you so thoughtful, husband! tell me your secret\nanxieties?" Suttrajeet replied, "It is not right to reveal important secrets\nto a wife, as she cannot keep them; what she hears at home, she publishes\nabroad; she is ignorant, and without knowledge of any thing, good or bad."\nSuttrajeet\'s wife was angry at this speech, and said, "When did I ever publish\nabroad any thing I heard at home, as you state? Are all women alike?" She\nadded, "Until you mention to me, what is preying upon your mind I will abstain\nfrom all sustenance." Suttrajeet replied, "Truth and falsehood are known to\nBhugwan; but I will inform you of what I am thinking, provided you will not\ntell any one." His wife assented. Suttrajeet began to say, "One day Shree\nKrishnu Jee asked me for the jewel, and I did not give it, I, therefore, think\nthat he has killed my brother in the forest, and taken away the jewel; this\nmust have been done by him, as no one else has the power to perform such an\nact."\n\np. 246\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! his wife did not sleep after hearing this account, and passed the night\nin great perplexity of mind. Early in the morning, she said to her female\ncompanions and servants, "Shree Krishnu Jee has killed Pursen, and taken away\nthe jewel, I heard this from my husband last night, but do not mention it to\nany one." They went away silently agreeing not to speak of the matter; but in\nprivate, began to talk to each other, in astonishment, upon the subject. At\nlength one of the servants went and mentioned the subject in the female\napartments of Shree Krishnu Chund. On hearing it, all the women thought, that\nif Suttrajeet\'s wife had said so, the statement could not be false; and having\nformed this opinion, they began to blame, and speak ill of, Shree Krishnu." In\nthe mean while, some one came, and said to Shree Krishnu Jee, "You are under a\nsuspicion, O great king! of having killed Pursen, and taken away the jewel;\nwhy are you sitting idle? You should adopt some measures to counteract these\nstatements." On hearing this statement, Shree Krishnu Jee was at first\nfrightened; afterwards, reflecting on the subject, he came to the court, where\nOogursen and Basoodeo and Bulram were sitting, and said, O great king! I am\naccused of having killed Pursen, and carried off the jewel; I will, therefore,\nwith your permission, go and search for them both, in order that this disgrace\nmay be wiped away."\n\nHaving thus spoken, Shree Krishnu Jee went thence to the forest, taking with\nhim several of the descendants of Judoo, and the companions of Pursen. When\nthey had gone some distance, they saw marks of horse\'s feet, on tracing which,\nthey reached the spot where a lion had devoured Pursen and his horse. On\nseeing the remains of their bodies, and the marks of a lion\'s feet, they were\nall of opinion, that the lion must have killed them. Thinking thus, and not\nhaving obtained the jewel, Shree Krishnu Chund went, accompanied by them all,\nto that\n\np. 247\n\ndeep, dark and terrible cave. At the entrance, he saw a lion lying dead, but\ndid not find the jewel there. On beholding this strange sight, they all said\nto Shree Krishnu Jee, "O great king! whence has such a powerful animal come\ninto this forest, as to be able to kill a lion, and carry off the jewel into\nthe cave? Adopt measures immediately against him. You have made all necessary\nsearch, and have obliterated all the suspicions, that were raised against you,\nthe disgrace is now upon the lion\'s head." Shree Krishnu Jee said, Come let us\ngo into the cave, and see who has killed the lion, and taken away the jewel."\nThey all replied, "O great king! we are terrified at beholding the mouth of\nthe cave; how shall we be able to enter it? Moreover, we beseech you also, not\nto go into this frightful cavern, let us return home; we will all say in the\ncity, that a lion killed Pursen, and carried off the jewel; and that some\nanimal killed the lion, and went into a deep and very terrible cave with the\njewel. We all saw this with our own eyes." Shree Krishnu Chund replied, "My\nmind is intent upon the jewel, and I will go into the cave alone; in ten days,\nI will return, stay here that time; and if I delay beyond that time, return\nhome, and give information of the matter." O great king! having thus spoken,\nHuri entered that dark, frightful cave, and pursuing his journey arrived at\nthe place, where Jamwunt was sleeping, and his wife rocking her daughter in a\ncradle of chalk. On beholding Krishnu, she called out through fear, and\nJamwunt awoke, and making a rush, grappled Krishnu, and they both began to\nwrestle. When neither his stratagems nor strength succeeded against Huri, he\nbegan to reflect and say, "Luchmun Ram is my equal in strength, who else in\nthe world is so powerful as to be able to fight with me?" O great king!\nJamwunt having thus reflected, and meditating upon Krishnu, shrunk back with\njoined hands, and said, "O Rugoonath! "appear to me, I know you to be\nacquainted with the secrets\n\np. 248\n\nof the heart, and recognize you by beholding your exploits. You have done well\nin descending upon the earth; remove the burthens of the world. I have dwelt\nhere since the Treta age. Narud has told me your history; that Krishnu would\ncome here for the jewel, and then he will appear to you."\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--Raja! When Jamwunt, having recognised Krishnu, spoke thus, Shree\nMoorari, the friend of his worshippers, beholding the attachment of Jamwunt,\nwas delighted; and assuming the appearance of Ram, appeared to him with a bow\nand arrows, and Jamwunt, having prostrated himself so as to touch the ground\nwith the eight principal parts of his body, stood up; and joining his hands\nsaid, with the greatest humility, "O sea of compassion and brother of the\n"poor! with your permission, I will explain my wishes." Krishnu granted\npermission. Then Jamwunt said, "O purifier of the guilty and lord of the poor!\nit is the wish of my mind to give you this damsel, Jamwutee, in marriage, and\nobtain celebrity and greatness in the world by so doing." Bhugwan replied, "If\nsuch is your desire, it is acceptable to me." When Krishnu had thus spoken,\nJamwunt took sandal, unbroken rice, flowers, perfumes, lamps and consecrated\nfood, and worshipped him; and afterwards married his daughter to him in the\nmanner, and with the ceremonies prescribed by the Vedas, giving her the jewel\nas a part of her dowry.\n\nHaving related thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said,--\nRaja! Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, taking with him Jamwutee and the\njewel, came forth from the cave. And now be pleased to listen to what befel\nthe descendants of Judoo, and companions of Pursen and Shree Krishnu, who were\nstanding at the mouth of the cave. When twenty-eight days had elapsed and Huri\ndid not return, they went thence, devoid of all hope; and came to Dwarka,\ntroubled with all kinds of perplexing thoughts, and shedding tears. The\n\np. 249\n\ndescendants of Judoo were very much alarmed at the intelligence they brought;\nand calling on the name of Shree Krishnu, and suffering great\n[affliction](errata.htm#13), they began to weep and lament; and there was\nmourning in all the female apartments. At length, all the women being much\nagitated, emaciated and in low spirits, went forth from the palace, and\nweeping violently came to a temple of Devee, distant about a toss outside the\ncity. Having worshipped and propitiated Devee, joining their hands and bowing\ntheir heads, they began to say, "O Devee! gods, men and sages, all meditate\nupon thee, and receive from thee whatever boon they ask, tell us, when will\nShree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, come?"\n\nO great king! all the women sat down at the entrance of the temple, and\ncontinued imploring Devee; Oogursen, Basoodeo, Buldeo and the other\ndescendants of Judoo were sitting in a state of great anxiety, when Shree\nKrishnu, the immortal, the dweller in Dwarka, smiling and bringing Jamwutee\nwith him, came and stood in the royal court; all were delighted at beholding\nthe moon-like face of Krishnu. And on hearing the good news of his arrival,\nall the women having worshipped Devee, returned home; and began to engage in\nfestive rejoicings.\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! Shree\nKrishnu Jee, sitting in the court, sent for Suttrajeet, and, having given him\nthe jewel, said, "I did not take away this jewel, and you suspected me\nfalsely. Jamwunt took away this jewel, and has given it to me, together with\nhis daughter." Taking the jewel, Suttrajeet went away, bowing his head, and\nthoughtful:--"I have committed a great crime against Huri, and ignorantly\nabused his family; I have cast a slur and suspicion on the lord of the Judoos,\nand have shown great enmity to him for the sake of the jewel. I must now\nendeavour to atone for my fault, and give the jewel, Sutbhama, to Krishnu."\nWith these thoughts in his mind, Suttrajeet went home with the jewel,\n\np. 250\n\ndepressed in spirits, and explained all his anxieties to his wife. His wife\nsaid, "O husband! this is a good thought of yours. Give Sutbhama to Shree\nKrishnu, and obtain celebrity in the world."\n\nOn hearing these words, Suttrajeet sent for a brahmin; and having fixed upon a\nfavourable rising of a sign of the zodiack, and a division of time equal to\nforty-eight minutes, and placing on a dish a coloured mixture for the\nforehead, unbroken rice, a rupee and a cocoanut, sent the nuptial gifts to\nShree Krishnu Chund by the hands of the family priest. Shree Krishnu Jee came\nto the marriage with great pomp and splendour, wearing a high crowned hat.\nThen Suttrajeet, having observed all the usual forms and ceremonies, gave his\ndaughter in marriage according to the injunctions of the Vedas, and having\nbestowed great wealth upon her, added the jewel also to her dowry. On\nbeholding the jewel, Shree Krishnu Jee drew it forth, and said, "This jewel is\nof no use to me, because you have obtained it for having performed a penance\nin honour of the sun. Keep this in your own house, as my family do not accept\nthe things bestowed by other gods, with exception of Bhugwan."\n\nO great king! when Shree Krishnu Chund had thus spoken, Suttrajeet took the\njewel, and was ashamed, and Shree Krishnu Jee returned home in musical\nprocession with Sutbhama, and lived happily with her in the royal palace. The\nRaja Pureechit interrupted Shree Shookdeo Jee in this part of the story, and\nenquired, "O abode of compassion! kindly explain, why the suspicion and\ncalumny of the theft were fastened upon Shree Krishnu Jee?" Shookdeo Jee\nreplied, Raja! Mohun had seen the moon, when it was four days old in the month\nof Bhadon; and hear me, whoever, having heard this history, shall see the moon\nwhen four days old in the month of Bhadon, shall escape unblemished.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LVIII](psa59.htm)\n\n'
