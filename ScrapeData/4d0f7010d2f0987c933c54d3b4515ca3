His sire's behest,  \nBy Queen Kaikeyi's guile distressed,  \nHas banished to the forest hence  \nHim who was all the world's defence.  \nAh, senseless King, to drive away  \nThe hope of men, their guard and stay,  \nTo banish to the distant wood  \nRama the duteous, true, and good!'  \nThe royal dames, like cows bereaved  \nOf their young calves, thus sadly grieved.  \nThe monarch heard them as they wailed,  \nAnd by the fire of grief assailed  \nFor his dear son, he bowed his head,  \nAnd all his sense and memory fled.  \n   Then were no fires of worship fed,  \nThick darkness o'er the sun was spread.  \nThe cows their thirsty calves denied,  \nAnd elephants flung their food aside.  \n\np. 144  \n\nTris'anku,  [1](ry120.htm#fn_315) Jupiter looked dread,  \nAnd Mercury and Mars the red,  \nIn direful opposition met,  \nThe glory of the moon beset.  \nThe lunar stars withheld their light,  \nThe planets were no longer bright,  \nBut meteors with their horrid glare,  \nAnd dire Vis'akhas  [2](ry120.htm#fn_316) lit the air.  \nAs troubled Ocean heaves and raves  \nWhen Doom's wild tempest sweeps the waves,  \nThus all Ayodhya reeled and bent  \nWhen Rama to the forest went.  \nAnd chilling grief and dark despair  \nFell suddenly on all men there.  \nTheir wonted pastime all forgot,  \nNor thought of food, or touched it not.  \nCrowds in the royal street were seen  \nWith weeping eye and troubled mien:  \nNo more a people gay and glad,  \nEach head and heart was sick and sad.  \nNo more the cool wind softly blew,  \nThe moon no more was fair to view,  \nNo more the sun with genial glow  \nCherished the world now plunged in woe.  \nSons, brothers, husbands, wedded wives  \nForgot the ties that joined their lives;  \nNo thought for kith and kin was spared,  \nBut all for only Rama cared.  \nAnd Rama's friends who loved him best,  \nTheir minds disordered and distressed.  \nBy the great burthen of their woes  \nTurned not to slumber or repose.  \n   Like Earth with all her hills bereft  \n     Of Indra's guiding care.  \n   Ayodhya in her sorrow left  \n     By him, the high souled heir.  \n   Was bowed by fear and sorrow's force,  \n     And shook with many a throe,  \n   While warrior, elephant, and horse  \n     Sent up the cry of woe.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[143:1](ry118.htm#fr_314) 'Thirty centuries have passed since he began this\nmemorable journey. Every step of it is known and is annually traversed by\nthousands: hero worship is not extinct. What can Faith do! How strong are the\nties of religion when entwined with the legends of a country! How many a cart\ncreeps creaking and weary along the road from Ayodhya to Chitrakut. It is this\nthat gives the Ramayan a strange interest, the story still lives.' _Calcutta\nReview: Vol. XXIII._\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLII.: Das'aratha's Lament.](ry120.htm)\n\n"
