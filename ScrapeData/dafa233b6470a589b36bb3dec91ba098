On the ground of imaginative identification (the highest Lord may be\ncalled prade _s_ amatra), _G_ aimini thinks; for thus (Scripture) declares.\n\nOr else the passage about him who is measured by a span may be considered to\nrest on imaginative combination.--Why?--Because the passage of the Va _g_\nasaneyi-brahma _n_ a\n\np. 152\n\nwhich treats of the same topic identifies heaven, earth, and so on--which are\nthe members of Vai _s_ vanara viewed as the Self of the threefold world--with\ncertain parts of the human frame, viz. the parts comprised between the upper\npart of the head and the chin, and thus declares the imaginative identity of\nVai _s_ vanara with something whose measure is a span. There we read, 'The\nGods indeed reached him, knowing him as measured by a span as it were. Now I\nwill declare them (his members) to you so as to identify him (the Vai _s_\nvanara) with that whose measure is a span; thus he said. Pointing to the upper\npart of the head he said: This is what stands above (i.e. the heavenly world)\nas Vai _s_ vanara (i.e. the head of Vai _s_ vanara 1). Pointing to the eyes he\nsaid: This is he with good light (i.e. the sun) as Vai _s_ vanara (i.e. the\neye of V.). Pointing to the nose he said: This is he who moves on manifold\npaths (i.e. the air) as Vai _s_ vanara (i.e. the breath of V.). Pointing to\nthe space (ether) within his mouth he said: This is the full one (i.e. the\nether) as Vai _s_ vanara. Pointing to the saliva within his mouth he said:\nThis is wealth as Vai _s_ vanara (i.e. the water in the bladder of V.).\nPointing to the chin he said: This is the base as Vai _s_ vanara (i.e. the\nfeet of V.).'--Although in the Va _g_ asaneyi-brahma _n_ a the heaven is\ndenoted as that which has the attribute of standing above and the sun as that\nwhich has the attribute of good light, while in the _Kh_ andogya the heaven is\nspoken of as having good light and the sun as being multiform; still this\ndifference does not interfere (with the unity of the vidya) 2, because both\ntexts equally use the term 'measured by a span,' and because all _s_ akhas\nintimate the same.--The above explanation of the term 'measured by a span,'\nwhich rests on imaginative identification, the teacher _G_ aimini considers\nthe most appropriate one.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[152:1](sbe34068.htm#fr_166) Atra sarvatra vai _s_ vanara _s_ abdas tada _n_\ngapara _h_.
