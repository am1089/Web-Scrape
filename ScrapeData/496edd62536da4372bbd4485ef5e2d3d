A short while after Keshab\'s\ndisciples came in and bowed down before the Bhagavan, saying: "Keshab Babu has\nsent us to Thee with the request that Thou wilt kindly join him, if it so\nplease Thy Holiness." Sri Ramakrishna consented and, accompanied by several of\nHis devotees, was taken by Keshab\'s disciples to the steamer.\n\nRamakrishna\'s ecstasy.As the small boat which carried the Bhagavan came\nalongside, everybody was eager to have a glimpse of the Blessed One and\ncrowded to the gangway. Keshab was anxious to see that He got on board in\nsafety. Mahendra, * who had been there for some time, looked at Him and\nnoticed that He was in Samadhi and as motionless as a statue. It was with\ngreat difficulty that He was brought back to sense-consciousness once more in\norder to be taken into the cabin on the upper deck. The state of Divine\necstasy had not entirely left Him even then. He leaned on a disciple as He was\nled to the cabin. His body moved\n\np. 144\n\nmechanically, but His mind was fixed on God. When He had entered the cabin,\nKeshab and others bowed at His feet. But what little sense-consciousness\nremained now began to leave Him. Inside the cabin were a bench, a table and a\nfew chairs. The Bhagavan was seated on one of the chairs; Keshab also took a\nchair and Bijoy, another. Other devotees, most of them Brahmos, sat on the\nbare floor. The cabin being a small one, many remained standing at the door or\nat the windows looking in eagerly. The Bhagavan was absolutely devoid of outer\nconsciousness. Everybody was watching His face. Keshab noticed that so large a\nnumber of people had come together in the cabin that the Bhagavan was in need\nof air. The devotees all gazed with fixed eyes. After a time the Bhagavan came\ndown from His Samadhi, but the consciousness of the Divine Presence was as\nintense as before. He talked to the Mother of the universe in words that were\nscarcely articulate, saying: "O Mother, why hast Thou brought me here? They\nare hedged around and are not free! Is it indeed possible for me to save them\nout of their prison house?"\n\nA Brahmo said to the Bhagavan: Sir, these\n\np. 145\n\nPowhari Baba of Gazipur.gentlemen have been fortunate enough to see  Powhari\nBaba * at Gazipur. The baba is another holy man like Thy revered self.\n\nSri Ramakrishna had not yet recovered the power of speech. His heart was full\nand He could not speak, but only smiled on the good man who talked of the\nBaba. The Brahmo continued: Sir, Powhari Baba has Thy photograph, which he has\nput up in his room.\n\nDevotee\'s heart the temple of the lord.The Bhagavan smiled again, pointing to\nHis body with His finger and in a subdued tone said: A pillow-case! It is\nnothing but a pillow-case. But there is one thing to be borne in mind: the\nheart of the devotee is the temple of the Lord. It is indeed a fact that the\nLord is more or less manifest in all things, but He is manifest in a special\nsense in the heart of a devotee (Bhakta). Thus a Zemindar may be met at any of\nthe houses of which he is the owner;\n\np. 146\n\nyet people will say that he is usually to be seen in some particular drawing-\nroom. The heart of the devotee is the Lord\'s drawing-room. If one wishes to\nmeet the Lord, one would better seek an audience in the drawing-room.\n\nVarious aspects of the Brahman.The same Being whom the followers of non-\ndualistic (Advaita) Vedanta call Brahman, the Absolute, is called \xc3\x82tman (Self)\nby the Yogis, and Bhagavan, or the Personal God with Divine attributes, by the\ndevotees, or Bhaktas (lovers of God). The high-caste Brahmin is always the\nsame person; but when he worships the Lord, he is called a priest; and when\nthe same man is employed in the kitchen, he is called a cook.\n\nDiscrimination of an Advaitin.The follower of monistic (Advaita) Vedanta, who\nseeks to realize the Absolute Brahman, discriminates, saying: "Not this, not\nthis." That is, the Absolute is not this, not that, not any finite object, not\nthe individual soul, not the external world. When, as the result of this kind\nof reasoning, the heart ceases to be moved by desires; when, in fact, the mind\nis merged in superconsciousness, then Brahma-jnana is reached. One who has\ntruly attained to this. Brahma-jnana realizes that Brahman the Absolute alone\nis real, and the\n\np. 147\n\nworld is unreal, and that all names and forms are like dreams. What Brahman is\ncannot be described by word of mouth nor can one even say that He is personal.\nSuch is the point of view of a non-dualist.\n\nBhakta\'s attitude.The dualistic devotees and lovers of the Personal God\n(Bhaktas), on the contrary, accept all states as real. Unlike the non-\ndualists, they look upon the waking state as a reality and they do not hold\nthat the external world is like a dream. They say that the external world is\nthe glory of the Lord. The heavens, stars, moon, mountains, ocean, men, birds\nand beasts, all these He has created. He manifests His glory by these. He is\nboth within and without. He dwells in our hearts. The most advanced Bhaktas\nsay that the Lord Himself manifests as the twenty-four categories of the\nSankhya philosophy, that He appears as the individual soul and the external\nworld. A Bhakta wishes to enjoy communion with his Lord and not to become one\nwith Him. His desire is not to become sugar, but to taste of it. The innermost\nfeelings of a true Bhakta.Do you know what are the innermost thoughts and\nfeelings of a true devotee? He says: "O Lord! Thou art the Master, I am Thy\nservant.\n\np. 148\n\nRaja Yogi.[paragraph continues] Thou art my Mother, and I am Thy child"; or\nagain: "Thou art my Child and I am Thy father or Thy mother"; or thus: "Thou\nart the Whole and I am Thy part." The dualistic devotee does not wish to say,\n"I am Brahman." A Raja Yogi also seeks to realize the Universal Being. His\nobject is to bring the finite human soul into communion with the infinite\nSpirit. He tries first to collect his mind which is scattered in the world of\nsenses, and then seeks to fix it on the Universal Spirit; hence the necessity\nof meditating on Him in solitude and in a posture which causes no distraction.\n\nDifferent aspects of God.But all these various ideals are of one and the same\nBrahman, the difference being only in the names. It is the same Being whom men\ncall by the name of the Absolute (Brahman), the Universal Spirit, the\nImpersonal God, or the Personal God with Divine attributes.\n\nii\n\nThe steamer had already started and was on its way to Calcutta. Many there\nwere who looked on Sri Ramakrishna with eyes that did not move, and who drank\nthe nectar of the words\n\np. 149\n\nthat dropped from His hallowed lips. They did not perceive that the steamer\nwas in motion. The Temple garden of Kali had faded from sight. Beneath were\nthe sacred waters which reflected the blue firmament above, but the murmur of\nthe waves fell unheeded on the ears of the devotees. The magic of the blessed\nvision had thrown a charm over them. They beheld before them a wonderful\nBeing, a God-in-Man and a Man-in-God, with smiles playing on His sweet face,\nradiant with the joy of the Lord, and with eyes enhanced in beauty by the\ncollyrium of Divine Love. They gazed as if spell-bound, on One who had given\nup the world and its pleasures, on One intoxicated with the Love of the Lord\nand who looked not for anything except the Lord.\n\nThe world as a dream.Sri Ramakrishna: The followers of Advaita Vedanta\nmaintain that creation, preservation, and dissolution, the individual ego, the\nexternal world, all these are manifestations of the Eternal Energy (Sakti).\nThey also say that when these are properly analyzed, they appear as dreams,\nthat the Absolute Brahman alone is the Reality, and all else is unreal. Even\neternal Energy (Sakti) is like a dream, unreal; but you may analyze and\ndiscriminate\n\np. 150\n\nThe realm the Divine Energy.of thousands of times, you cannot transcend the\nrealm of Divine Energy (Sakti) unless you have reached the highest state of\nSamadhi, superconsciousness. The very thoughts like: "I am meditating," "I am\nthinking on the Absolute," are within the realm of Sakti. They are the\nmanifested powers of that Eternal Energy. Therefore the Absolute Brahman and\nthe Eternal Energy are inseparable and one. The existence of one implies that\nof the other; as fire and its burning power. If you admit the existence of\nfire, how can you deny its burning power? Relation between Brahman and\nSakti.No one can think of fire without thinking of its burning power. Again,\nthe power of burning cannot be conceived as separate from fire. In the same\nmanner, we cannot think of the rays of the sun, without thinking of the sun\nhimself. Again, we cannot think of the sun without thinking of his rays.\nTherefore, no one can think of Brahman as apart from Sakti, or Sakti as\nseparate from Brahman. Likewise, no one can conceive of the phenomenal as\nindependent of the Absolute, or of the Absolute as apart from the phenomenal.\nThe same Eternal Energy, the Mother of all phenomena, is creating, preserving,\nand\n\np. 151\n\ndestroying everything. She is called Kali, the Divine Mother. Kali is Brahman,\nBrahman is Kali, one and the same Being. I call Him Brahman when He is\nabsolutely inactive; that is, when He neither creates, nor preserves, nor\ndestroys phenomena; but when He performs all such actions, I call Him Kali,\nthe Eternal Energy, the Divine Mother. They are one and the same Being, the\ndifference is in name and form, just as the same substance water is called by\ndifferent names in different languages, such as jal, aqua, pani, etc. One God\nhas many names.Yes, the Being is the same, only the names are different under\ndifferent aspects--like the same sub- stance expressed in different languages,\nsuch as jal, water and pani. A tank may have four Ghats (landing-places with\nsteps). The Hindus drink at one Ghat and call it jal; the Mohammedans drink at\nanother and call it pani; while the English who drink at a third call it\nwater. Similarly, God is One, only His names are different. Some call Him by\nthe name of Allah, some God, some Brahman, others Kali, others again Rama,\nHari, Jesus, Buddha.\n\nKeshab, smiling: Please tell us once more, Revered Sir, in what different ways\nKali, the\n\np. 152\n\n[paragraph continues] Mother of the Universe, is making Herself manifest in\nthis world of Her sports.\n\nThe Mother of the universe and Her sports.Sri Ramakrishna, smiling: Oh, the\nMother sports with the world, Her toy, under various aspects and names. Now\nShe is the God Unconditioned, Absolute, Formless (Maha-Kali): now the\nEverlasting as distinguished from Her works (Nitya-Kali). Under another aspect\nShe is the Goddess of burning Ghats or crematories, the dreaded Being who\npresides over death (Smasan-Kali); now again does She stand before us ready to\nbless, to preserve Her children (Rakshya-Kali); under another aspect She\nappears pleasing to the eye of Her devotees as the Mother with the dark blue\ncolor, Consort of the God of Eternity and Infinity. Maha-Kali and Nitya-Kali\nare described in the sacred books, the Tantras: "When nothing was--neither\nsun, nor moon, nor planets, nothing but Darkness Deep, there was alone my\nDivine Mother, Formless, the Eternal Consort of the Infinite." As Mother with\nthe dark blue color (Syama), She is tender and loving. She is the bestower of\nall blessings and makes Her children fearless; She is worshipped in the Hindu\nhousehold. As Preserver She appears in times of plague, famine, earthquake,\n\np. 153\n\ndrought or flood. At cemeteries, burning Ghats or crematories She appears in\nthe form of the Destroyer. The dead body, the jackal, the spirits of\ndestruction are Her terrible companions. She lives in the midst of those\nhorrible scenes, of those fearful environments. Streams of blood, a garland of\nskulls thrown round Her neck, a girdle made of the hands of those that are\ndead, are the symbols that mark Her as the dread Mother, as the All-Destroyer.\n\nCreation of the world.Now look at Her mode of creation. At the end of a cycle,\nupon the destruction of the world, my Mother, good Matron that She is, puts\ntogether the seeds of creation. The mistress of a house has a hodgepodge pot\nof her own in which to keep sundry things for household use. (Ramakrishna,\nsmiling) Yes, my friends, that is indeed so. The mistress of a house has such\na pot in her possession. In it are kept the "sea-foam" in a solid state, small\nparcels containing seeds of the cucumber, gourd, and so on. She brings them\nout when wanted. In much the same way my Mother keeps the seeds of creation\nafter the destruction of the world at the end of a cycle.\n\np. 154\n\nDivine Mother omnipresent.My Mother, the Primal Divine Energy, is both within\nand without this phenomenal world. Having given birth to the world, She lives\nwithin it. In the Vedas we find the illustration of a spider and its web.\nDivine Mother, the material and the instrumental cause.She is the spider and\nthe world is the web that She has woven. The spider brings the phenomenal web\nout of herself and then lives on it. My Mother is both the Container and the\nContained. Is Kali, the Divine Mother, black? She looks black from a distance,\nbut when realized, Kali, why black?She is not black. The sky looks blue from a\ndistance, but look at it near you, it has no color. The water of the ocean is\nblue from a distance. Take a little up in the hand, and it has no color.\nSaying this, the Bhagavan became intoxicated with Divine Love, and began to\nsing:\n\n"Is my Divine Mother black?  \n   O mind! What dost thou say?  \n Though black, She with Her flowing hair  \n   Illumines the lotus of the heart."\n\nBondage and freedom, of both She is the maker. Through Her inscrutable power\nof\n\np. 155\n\nThe Power of the Divine Mother.[paragraph continues] Maya a man of the world\nbecomes bound by woman and gold. Again, through Her grace he becomes free. She\nbreaks all fetters and takes Her children across the ocean of the world; and\nthe Bhagavan sang in His divine voice:\n\nThe Divine Mother and the Liberated Soul\n\n1\\. O Mother, Thou art flying the paper kite (of the human being) in the\nmarket-place of this world.  \nIt flies on the wind of hope, tied to the string of Maya.\n\n2\\. Ribs, nerves and bones make up its frame,  \nOf Thine own qualities hast Thou made the Kite, to display Thine art.\n\n3\\. Thou hast rubbed the string with the Manja (paste with powdered glass) of\nworldliness, and it has become sharp.  \nAmong hundred thousand Kites one or two have their strings cut, and are freed;  \nThen with a laugh Thou clappest Thy hands.\n\n4\\. Prasad says, The Kite thus set free will fly swiftly on fair winds and\ndrop beyond the ocean of this world.\n\np. 156\n\nDivine Mother\'s will.Sri Ramakrishna continuing: My Divine Mother is playful.\nThe world indeed is Her sport. She does what She will and is blissful. It is\nHer pleasure to give freedom to one among a hundred thousand of Her children.\n\nA Brahmo: Sir, She can, if She pleases, set every body free. Why is it then\nthat She has bound us hand and foot with the chains of the world?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: Well, I suppose it is Her will. Her will is to play with all\nthese things. In the game of Hide-and-Seek, whoever touches the Grand-dame is\nout. He no longer runs about. If all the players touch the Grand-dame at the\nsame time, how can there be any game? The Grand-dame would not like it; for\nshe is pleased to have the play go on.\n\nAnd the Bhagavan, placing Himself in the position of a man of the world laying\nthe trouble of his heart before the Mother, sang:\n\nThe Divine Mother and Her Children\n\n1\\. This is the grief for which I grieve.  \nWhen Thou, O Mother, art here, thieves (passions) rob me though I am wide\nawake\n\np. 157\n\n2\\. I promise to repeat Thy Holy Name, but at the proper hour I forget.  \nNow I have learnt and felt that all this is Thy trick.\n\n3\\. Thou hast not given, so Thou hast not received aught to eat or to keep. Am\nI to be blamed for this?  \nHadst Thou given, Thou wouldst surely have received; and I would have offered\nThy gifts to Thee.\n\n4\\. Fame or calumny, sweet or bitter--all is Thine.  \nO Ruler of all feelings, abiding in them, why dost Thou hinder when I enjoy\nsweet ecstasy?\n\n5 Prasad says: Thou hast given me a mind, but by a glance of Thine eye Thou\nhast so bent it, that I roam through this world, Thy creation, seeking joy but\nmistaking bitter for sweet (unreal for Real).\n\nDelusive power of Maya.Man has forgotten his true Self and has become worldly\nby the delusive power of Maya. Therefore Prasad says: "Thou hast given me a\nmind, but by a glance of Thine eye Thou hast so bent it that\n\np. 158\n\n[paragraph continues] I roam through this world, Thy creation, seeking joy but\nmistaking bitter for sweet."\n\nA Brahmo: Revered Sir, is it true that God cannot be realized without giving\nup the world?\n\nRenunciation not necessary for all.The Bhagavan, smiling: Oh no! You do not\nhave to give up everything. You are better off where you are. By living in the\nworld you are enjoying the taste both of the pure crystallized sugar and of\nthe molasses with all its impurities. You are indeed better off. Verily I say\nunto you, you are living in the world, there is no harm in that; but you will\nhave to fix your mind on God, otherwise you cannot realize Him. Work with one\nhand and hold the Feet of the Lord with the other. When you have finished your\nwork, fold His feet to your heart with both your hands.\n\nPower of the mind.Everything is in the mind. Bondage and freedom are in the\nmind. You can dye the mind with any color you wish. It is like a piece of\nclean white linen; dip it in red and it will be red, in blue it will be blue,\nin green it will be green, or any other color. Do you not see that if you\nstudy English, English words will come readily to you? Again,\n\np. 159\n\nif a Pandit studies Sanskrit, he will readily quote verses from Sacred Books.\nIf you keep your mind in evil company, your thoughts, ideas and words will be\ncolored with evil; but keep in the company of Bhaktas, then your thoughts,\nideas and words will be of God. The mind is everything. On one side is the\nwife, on the other side is the child; it loves the wife in one way and the\nchild in another way, yet the mind is the same.\n\nBy the mind one is bound; by the mind one is freed. If I think I am absolutely\nfree, whether I live in the world or in the forest, where is my bondage? I am\nthe child of God, the son of the King of kings; who can bind me? When bitten\nby a snake, if you assert with firmness, "There is no venom in me," you will\nbe cured. In the same way, he who asserts with strong conviction "I am not\nbound, I am free," becomes free.\n\nSense of sin.Some one gave me a book of the Christians. I asked him to read it\nto me. In it there was only one theme--sin and sin, from the beginning to the\nend. (To Keshab) In your Brahmo-Samaj the main topic is also sin. The fool who\nrepeats again and again, "I am bound, I am bound," remains in bondage.\n\np. 160\n\n[paragraph continues] He who repeats day and night, "I am a sinner, I am a\nsinner," becomes a sinner indeed.\n\nSaving power of God\'s name.It is necessary to have absolute faith in the Name\nof the Lord. "What! I have uttered His Holy Name, can there still be sin in\nme? Can I still be in bondage?" Kristo Kishore was a pious Hindu, a Brahmin of\nBrahmins, who worshipped the Lord with single-minded devotion. He went to\nVrindavan. One day, while visiting the shrines, he felt very thirsty. He went\nto a well, and finding a man standing there, he asked him: "My man, can you\ndraw some water for me?" The man replied: "O holy sir, I belong to a low\nclass, that of a cobbler." Kristo Kishore thereupon said to him: "It matters\nnot. You say \'Shiva\' (the Holy Name of the Lord) and draw the water for me."\n\nBy repeating the blessed Name of God, man\'s body, mind and soul become\nabsolutely pure. Why talk of sin and hell-fire? Repeat but once, "I shall\nnever again do the evil deeds that I have committed in the past," and by thy\nfaith in His Hallowed Name thou shalt be freed from all sins.\n\nI used to pray to my Divine Mother for true\n\np. 161\n\nPrayer to the Divine Mother.devotion (Bhakti) alone. With flowers in my\nclasped hands, I prayed: "Do Thou, O Mother, grant that I may have pure and\nunalloyed devotion. Here is sin, here again is virtue; I lay them at Thy feet;\nOh take them both. Here is knowledge (of many things), here again is\nignorance; Oh take them both and grant that I may have devotion alone. Here is\npurity and here again is impurity; I desire neither of them. Here are good\nworks, here are bad; both I lay at Thy feet; Oh grant that I may have devotion\nalone and love for Thee."\n\nExample of Janaka.One living in the world may also see God. It was the case\nwith Raja Janaka, the great royal devotee, who realized while on the throne\nthat the world was a structure of dreams. For a lover of God, however, such is\nnot the feeling. And the Bhagavan sang:\n\nHe who has attained to Bhakti or true devotion to the Lord says:\n\n"This world is the abode of happiness;  \n   I eat, drink and enjoy its pleasures.  \n Janaka Raja was a great potentate;  \n   In what was he lacking?  \n He harmonized God and the world  \n   And tasted the joys of both."\n\np. 162\n\nValue of solitude.No one can suddenly become like Janaka. Raja Janaka\nperformed great penances and austerities in solitude for many long years. Even\nwhen living in the world one should occasionally go into solitude. It will\nbring great good to one who can sincerely and earnestly cry for God three days\nand three nights in solitude, alone. Indeed, one day passed in that way would\nbe a great gain. People will shed a jarful of tears for wives and children,\nbut who weeps one tear for the Lord? It is necessary to practise every now and\nthen devotional exercises in solitude. A worldly-minded aspirant absorbed in\nvarious works and duties finds in the first stage of his spiritual life a\ngreat number of obstacles in the path of self-control and devotion. As a young\ntree planted on the foot-path needs a fence around it that it may not be eaten\nup by sheep and cattle, so in the first stage of a spiritual aspirant, a fence\nis necessary, but when the tree grows large and the trunk and roots are\nthicker and stronger. no fence is required. Then it is not injured even if an\nelephant be tied to it.\n\nThe disease of a worldly man is of a serious type; his organs with their\nfunctions are entirely out of order. Would you keep a large\n\np. 163\n\nSolitude a remedy for Worldliness.water-jar and savory pickles in the same\nroom in which a patient with typhoid fever was lying? If you wish to cure such\na patient, you must have him removed from that room, in case it is impossible\nto send away the jar and the pickles. A man of the world is like unto such a\nthirsty patient; worldly attractions are like the jar of water; sense objects\nare like the savory pickles; desire to enjoy those things is the patient\'s\nthirst. The mouth waters at the mere thought of the pickles. We should not\ntherefore remain near them all the time. Hence solitude is the best remedy for\nworldliness. First acquire right discrimination and true dispassion and then\nlive in the world. In the sea of the world there are crocodiles of passions\nand desires. Rub the body with _turmeric-paste_ if you wish to bathe in the\nsea, for then crocodiles will do no harm to you. The turmeric is\ndiscrimination (of the Real from the unreal) and true dispassion. God is the\nonly Reality, the phenomenal universe is unreal.\n\nAlong with this another thing is needed, that is intense devotion to God. The\nGopis * of\n\np. 164\n\nIntense devotion necessary.[paragraph continues] Vrindavan had such devotion.\nThey had an intense love for Sri Krishna, God Incarnate.\n\nThe Bhagavan then said to Keshab and other devotees with great feeling: You\nare Brahmos; you believe that God is formless and you do not believe in God\nIncarnate. Well, it matters not. You need not accept Radha and Sri Krishna as\nIncarnations of the Supreme Being; hut the intense love and yearning which the\nGopis felt for Sri Krishna is a thing which you may well make your own, for\nyearning is the next step leading to God-vision.\n\niii\n\nIt was ebb-tide. The steamer was going fast down-stream towards Calcutta. It\nhad got to the other side of the Howrah Bridge within sight of the Botanical\nGardens. The Captain had orders to go a little farther down. How\n\np. 165\n\nfar the steamer had actually proceeded was not known to those who were\nlistening to Sri Ramakrishna and watching His movements. They listened with\nsuch rapt attention that they had no idea either of time or of distance.\n\nKeshab now offered the Bhagavan puffed rice with the kernel of the cocoanut.\nAll present were invited to partake of these. They took them in the folds of\ntheir cloth, ate and were very happy. It seemed as if a festival were being\nheld on board the steamer. The Bhagavan noticed that Bijoy and Keshab were not\nquite at home in each other\'s pretence. He wished to see them make up their\ndifference, for was not His mission to bring peace and goodwill among men? He\nsaid to Keshab:\n\nLook, my dear sir, here is Bijoy. As to your quarrels, well, do not worry\nyourselves on their account. There was fighting even between Shiva and Rama.\nShiva was Rama\'s spiritual Guru. After a little fighting, they made it up and\nbecame once more as good friends as ever. But the fighting went on among their\nfollowers. The gibbering of the ghosts and the chattering of the monkeys could\nnot so easily be quieted down. You too will be very good friends, once again.\nBut your followers,\n\np. 166\n\n[paragraph continues] I dare say, will follow your example. These differences,\nyou know, are things that. cannot be avoided. There was the tug of war even\nbetween father and son. Take the case of Rama and his sons Laba and Kusha.\nTake another case: The mother fasts on Tuesday for the welfare of her\ndaughter, but the daughter, quarrelling with the mother, fasts on Tuesday for\nher own welfare, as if her welfare were different from that gained by her\nmother\'s fasting. In the same way, you, Keshab, have a religious society\n(Samaj) of your own, and Bijoy, too, must have a separate society of his own.\nWell, there is room for all kinds of things under Providence--even for\nquarrels and differences. When God-Incarnate (Krishna) Himself appeared at\nVrindavan, the question may well be asked: Why did Jatilla and Kutilla stand\nin the way of His mission of love? I suppose His sport as a Divine Lover would\nhave died a natural death from want of nourishment but for these obstructions,\nthe _Jatillas_ and _Kutillas_. Opposition adds zest to a thing. Ramanuja *\nheld the doctrine of Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism). His Guru\n(spiritual guide), however,\n\np. 167\n\nwas an Advaitist (non-dualist without any qualification). They had their\ndifferences. Master and disciple disputed and refuted each other\'s opinions.\nThis is natural. Be it so; still to the master the disciple is always his own.\n\nThe nature of disciples must be examined.They all rejoiced. Sri Ramakrishna\nsaid to Keshab: You do not study and examine the nature of your disciples. For\nthat reason they drop away. All men look alike, but they differ in their\nnature. In some the Sattwa quality is predominant, in others Rajas, and in the\nrest Tamas. _Pooli_ (cakes) all look alike on the outside, but the contents\nvary; some may contain sweet thickened cream, others cocoanut sweetened with\nsugar, while others may have boiled _Kalai_ (pulse) with no sweetening.\n\nGod the one master.Do you know how I feel about it? Like a child I eat, drink\nand play, depending on my Divine Mother, who knows everything. These three\nwords prick me: Guru (spiritual master), Karta (the Lord), and Baba (father).\nI cannot bear them. The infinite Existence-Intelligence-Bliss is the one Guru\nfor all. He will teach everybody. I am only His child.\n\nIt is a difficult task to teach others. One\n\np. 168\n\nWho is a true spiritual teacher?can become a true spiritual teacher only when\none has realized God and received a Divine commission from Him. So\ncommissioned were Narada, * Sukadeva and Sankaracharya: \xe2\x80\xa0 If you are not\ncommissioned, who will listen to you? You know Calcutta and her fondness for\nthe latest sensation. Milk puffs up so long as it is over burning wood; but\nwhen the wood is withdrawn, the puffing ceases instantly. The people of\nCalcutta are fond of new sensations. They say they want water and they begin\nto dig a well at one place; but they give it up as soon as they find that the\nearth is hard and stony. They then set to work to dig at another place.\nSuppose the soil is sandy there; they will as readily give up digging at that\nspot. They will look about for another locality. That is the way with these\npeople. Their good opinion is by no means worth having.\n\np. 169\n\nDivine commission.Divine commission cannot be obtained by mere imagination.\nVerily I say, the Lord can be realized and He will speak to thee. Then thou\nmayest receive His commission. What great power lies in such Divine command!\nBy it mountains may be shaken to their foundation. What can a mere ordinary\nlecture do? People may listen to it for a time, but they will soon forget it.\nIt will not produce a lasting impression and they will not live according to\nit.\n\nOrdinary spiritual teachers are blind.For the teaching of Divine truths a\nbadge of authority is indispensable. A man who tries to teach others without\nit will be laughed at. He cannot get realization himself and he tries to show\nthe way to others. It is like the blind leading the blind. In this way more\nharm is done than good. When God is realized the inner spiritual sight opens\nand it is then that the true teacher can perceive the sickness of the soul and\ncan prescribe the proper remedy. Without God\'s command a man easily becomes\negotistic and thinks, "I have the power to teach others." Such egotism is the\nresult of ignorance. In ignorance one feels, "I am the doer;" but when one\nrealizes that "God is the Lord and doer of all, I cannot\n\np. 170\n\ndo anything," then one becomes absolutely free even in this life. All misery\nand restlessness proceed from the sense of "I" and "me," "I am the doer," "I\nam the actor."\n\nYou talk glibly of doing good to the world.\n\nFirst see God, then help the world.Is the world contained in a nutshell?\nBesides, who are you to do good to the world? First practice devotional\nexercises and realize God. Attain to Him. If He graciously gives you His\npowers (Sakti), then you can help others, and not till then.\n\nA Brahmo devotee: Revered Sir, are we to give up all works until we have seen\nGod?\n\nSri Ramakrishna: No, why will you give up all works? Meditation upon God,\nchanting His Holy Name, and other devotional exercises are daily works which\nyou should have to perform.\n\nThe devotee: But what about household works and business affairs?\n\nPray that worldly work may grow less.Sri Ramakrishna: Oh! you will also\nperform those, but only so far as is absolutely necessary for living in the\nworld; and you should at the same time pray in solitude unto the Lord with\ntears in your eyes for His grace, and for strength to do your duties without\nseeking any reward. Say when you pray: "Lord, grant that my work in\n\np. 171\n\nthe world and for the world may grow less and less day by day, for I see that\nmy work growing manifold only makes me lose sight of Thee. Sometimes I think\nthat I do my duties unattached to the world, but I know not how I deceive\nmyself and do them through attachment instead. I give alms to the poor, and\nbehold, I seek for fame, Oh I know not how!"\n\nShambhu (Mullik) * talked of founding hospitals and dispensaries, schools and\ncolleges, of God-vision and building roads, sinking wells and philanthropic\ndigging tanks for the good of all. I works. said to him: "Yes, whatever comes\nin your way and is absolutely necessary you will do; even that, without\nseeking any reward. Do not seek more work than you can well perform. If you do\nyou will forget the Lord. A man desired to see the shrine of the Divine\nMother. On his way he stopped and spent all\n\np. 172\n\nthe day in distributing alms to the poor. When he went to the shrine, the door\nwas closed and he could not see the Holy of Holies. The wise ones should first\nsee the Holy Mother, by pushing their way through the crowd assembled at the\ngate of the Temple, and after seeing Her, they may then turn their attention\nto alms-giving and other good works, if they so desire." All good works are\nfor the realization of God. Works are the means and God-vision is the end.\n\nGod-vision the end of all performance of duty.Therefore I said to Shambhu:\n"Suppose you see God, or that God manifests Himself to you, will you say to\nHim: \'Lord, do Thou grant that I may have lots of dispensaries and hospitals,\nschools and colleges!\'" A true devotee shall rather pray in this wise: "Grant,\nO good Lord, that I may have a niche in the Lotus of Thy Feet, that it may be\nmy privilege to live always in Thy Holy Presence and that I may have deep and\nunalloyed devotion unto Thee."\n\nPath of Bhakti Yoga best for us in this age.Karma Yoga is very difficult. It\nis difficult in this materialistic age (Kali-yuga) to get through all the\nworks, all the duties laid upon by the Sacred Books. Verily this age, earthly\nlife depends entirely upon material food. Works and duties, there is\n\np. 173\n\nscarcely time enough for them. It will be all over with the patient suffering\nfrom the burning fever of this world if he is allowed to go through the slow\nprocess of treatment practised by the old-fashioned Hindu physicians. People\nare short-lived and the malaria carries one off in a few days. The specific\nfor the present day is Dr. D. Gupta\'s patent fever mixture, which produces a\nmiraculous effect at once. Yes, in this age the one means of realizing God is\nBhakti or sincere devotion and love for Him, and earnest prayer and the\nchanting of His Holy Name and Divine attributes. (To Keshab and other\ndevotees) Your path, too, lies through devotion and self-surrender to the Lord\n(Bhakti Yoga). Blessed are ye who sing the Name of Hari and chant the praises\nof my Divine Mother. Your path is right. Unlike the non-dualists, you do not\nbelieve that this world is only a dream. You are not Jnanis, but Bhaktas; you\nbelieve in a Personal God, that is good. You are Bhaktas. If you can sincerely\nand earnestly cry for Him, you will surely obtain Him.\n\n(To Keshab) You talk against child marriage and the caste system, about female\nemancipation and female education. I say one thing is needful,--the\nrealization of God and devotion\n\np. 174\n\nto Him. First realize God and all other things shall be added unto you. Jadu\nMullik is a rich man. If you wish to cultivate his acquaintance, do not\ntrouble yourself as to how much wealth he has, how many houses he owns, how\nmany country-houses and gardens. First, be introduced to him and he will\nfurnish you with all the necessary information afterwards.\n\nParable of the deserted temple.There was a young man named Podo in a certain\nvillage. In that village was an old dilapidated temple. The holy image of God\nonce worshipped there had disappeared and it was now the home of small bats.\nOne day at nightfall the villagers were surprised to hear the sound of bells,\ngongs, and conch-shells issuing from the deserted temple. Men, women and\nchildren all flocked to the place. They thought that some devotee must be\nworshipping some image of God newly set up within the temple by performing the\n\xc3\x82rati, the evening ceremony of waving the lights and offering flowers, fruits\nand holy water. With folded hands they all stood listening to the sacred\nsounds before the temple. One of them, more curious than the rest, had the\ncourage to go inside. To his surprise he saw that Podo was ringing the bell\nand blowing\n\np. 175\n\nthe shell; but the floor was as dirty as before with impurities of all kinds\nand there was no image of God on the altar! He then called out, saying: "O\nPodo, thou hast no Madhava (Sri Krishna, God-Incarnate) in the temple; how is\nit, then, that thou hast raised all this clamor by blowing the conch-shell?\nAnd behold! thou hast not even taken the trouble to cleanse the temple by\nremoving the impurities and dirt of years and washing the floor with the holy\nwater of the Ganges!"\n\nFirst cleanse the heart.First realize God in the temple of your heart. With\nthat in view, you must cleanse it of all impurities, all sin and iniquity, all\nattachment to the world caused by the power of the senses. It is then that the\ntime comes for blowing the shell, if need be. Talk of social reforms! You may\nwell do so after realizing God. Remember, the Rishis of old gave up the world\nin order to attain to God. This is the one thing needful. All other things\nshall be granted unto you.\n\niv\n\nThe steamer had come back to Koylaghat (Calcutta). All on board held\nthemselves in readiness to land. As they came out of the\n\np. 176\n\ncabin they saw that the full moon had bathed the bosom of the Holy Ganges and\nthe adjoining banks with her mellow light. The Bhagavan with two or three\ndisciples got into a cab which had been kept waiting for Him on the shore.\nNandalal, Keshab\'s nephew, also got in. He wished to go with the Bhagavan for\nsome distance. When all had seated themselves in the cab, Sri Ramakrishna\nasked: "Where is Keshab?" In a few moments Keshab came up smiling and inquired\nwho were going with Him. Being satisfied with the answer, he bowed down to the\nground before the Bhagavan, who affectionately bade him adieu.\n\nThe cab set out. The Bhagavan was filled with supreme joy as the carriage\ndrove along. Suddenly He said: "I am thirsty; what is to be done?" Nandalal\nstopped the carriage before the gates of the India Club and went upstairs to\nbring water. It was brought in a glass tumbler. The Bhagavan, smiling, asked,\n"Is the glass well washed?" Nandalal replied, "Yes." The Bhagavan drank the\nwater. He was childlike in His simplicity. He put forward His face to look at\nthe various objects on both sides. His joy knew no bounds as He saw men,\nanimals, carriages, houses, the moonlight, the lighted streets!\n\np. 177\n\nNandalal got out at Colutola. The cab came to a stop before the door of Suresh\nMitra\'s * house. Suresh was very much attached to the Bhagavan, but he was not\nat home. He had gone to visit a newly-purchased garden at Kankurgachi. His\npeople opened a room on the ground floor and invited the party to be seated\nthere. The cab-fare was to be paid. Who was there to pay it? Had Suresh been\nat home, he would have done so. The Bhagavan said to a disciple: "Ask the\nladies of the house for the fare. I suppose they know well enough that their\nhusbands are in the habit of coming to our place."\n\nNarendra (Vivekananda) lived in the same neighborhood, so the Bhagavan sent\nfor him. Meanwhile the inmates of the house led Him upstairs into the drawing-\nroom. The matting of the floor was covered with a carpet and a white sheet.\nThree or four pillows were lying about. On the walls there hung a beautiful\noil-painting which Suresh intended to be a representation of the harmony of\nall religions.\n\np. 178\n\n[paragraph continues] In the painting Sri Ramakrishna was represented as\npointing to Keshab that all religions lead to one goal--be it Hinduism,\nMahometanism, Buddhism, Christianity, or their various sects.\n\nThe Bhagavan was conversing with smiles on His lips when Narendra carne up.\nHis joy redoubled. He said to Narendra as He talked: We enjoyed such a\npleasant trip on board the steamer with Keshab Sen. Bijoy also was there, and\nmany of those present here. You may ask Mahendra how I talked to Keshab and\nBijoy about the mother and her daughter both observing fast on Tuesday each\nfor her own welfare, and how God\'s Sports in this world would suffer for want\nof nourishment in the absence of obstructions like Jatilla and Kutilla.\n\nIt was getting late. But Suresh had not come home as yet. The Bhagavan asked\nto go back to the Temple at Dakshineswara. It was about half-past ten and He\nwished to leave for the garden. The streets were flooded with moonlight. The\ncab was at the door. The Bhagavan got in. Narendra and Mahendra bowed low to\nthe Master and started for their homes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[142:*](gork08.htm#fr_35) Keshab Chunder Sen was the third great Brahmo Samaj\nleader after Raja Rammohun Roy.
