If it be said that, in consequence of the ill-foundedness of reasoning,\nwe must frame our conclusions otherwise; (we reply that) thus also there would\nresult non-release.\n\nIn matters to be known from Scripture mere reasoning is not to be relied on\nfor the following reason also. As the thoughts of man are altogether\nunfettered, reasoning which disregards the holy texts and rests on individual\nopinion only has no proper foundation. We see how arguments, which some clever\nmen had excogitated with great pains, are shown, by people still more\ningenious, to be fallacious, and how the arguments of the latter again are\nrefuted in their turn\n\np. 315\n\nby other men; so that, on account of the diversity of men's opinions, it is\nimpossible to accept mere reasoning as having a sure foundation. Nor can we\nget over this difficulty by accepting as well-founded the reasoning of some\nperson of recognised mental eminence, may he now be Kapila or anybody else;\nsince we observe that even men of the most undoubted mental eminence, such as\nKapila, Ka _n_ ada, and other founders of philosophical schools, have\ncontradicted one another.\n\nBut (our adversary may here be supposed to say), we will fashion our reasoning\notherwise, i.e. in such a manner as not to lay it open to the charge of having\nno proper foundation. You cannot, after all, maintain that no reasoning\nwhatever is well-founded; for you yourself can found your assertion that\nreasoning has no foundation on reasoning only; your assumption being that\nbecause some arguments are seen to be devoid of foundation other arguments as\nbelonging to the same class are likewise devoid of foundation. Moreover, if\nall reasoning were unfounded, the whole course of practical human life would\nhave to come to an end. For we see that men act, with a view to obtaining\npleasure and avoiding pain in the future time, on the assumption that the\npast, the present, and the future are uniform.--Further, in the case of\npassages of Scripture (apparently) contradicting each other, the ascertainment\nof the real sense, which depends on a preliminary refutation of the apparent\nsense, can be effected only by an accurate definition of the meaning of\nsentences, and that involves a process of reasoning. Thus Manu also expresses\nhimself: 'Perception, inference, and the _s_ astra according to the various\ntraditions, this triad is to be known well by one desiring clearness in regard\nto right.--He who applies reasoning not contradicted by the Veda to the Veda\nand the (Sm _ri_ ti) doctrine of law, he, and no other, knows the law' (Manu\nSm _ri_ ti XII, 105, 106). And that 'want of foundation', to which you object,\nreally constitutes the beauty of reasoning, because it enables us to arrive at\nunobjectionable arguments by means of the previous refutation of objectionable\narguments 1. (No fear that because the\n\np. 316\n\npurvapaksha is ill-founded the siddhanta should be ill-founded too;) for there\nis no valid reason to maintain that a man must be stupid because his elder\nbrother was stupid.--For all these reasons the want of foundation cannot be\nused as an argument against reasoning.\n\nAgainst this argumentation we remark that thus also there results 'want of\nrelease.' For although with regard to some things reasoning is observed to be\nwell founded, with regard to the matter in hand there will result 'want of\nrelease,' viz. of the reasoning from this very fault of ill-foundedness. The\ntrue nature of the cause of the world on which final emancipation depends\ncannot, on account of its excessive abstruseness, even be thought of without\nthe help of the holy texts; for, as already remarked, it cannot become the\nobject of perception, because it does not possess qualities such as form and\nthe like, and as it is devoid of characteristic signs, it does not lend itself\nto inference and the other means of right knowledge.--Or else (if we adopt\nanother explanation of the word 'avimoksha') all those who teach the final\nrelease of the soul are agreed that it results from perfect knowledge. Perfect\nknowledge has the characteristic mark of uniformity, because it depends on\naccomplished actually existing things; for whatever thing is permanently of\none and the same nature is acknowledged to be a true or real thing, and\nknowledge conversant about such is called perfect knowledge; as, for instance,\nthe knowledge embodied in the proposition, 'fire is hot.' Now, it is clear\nthat in the case of perfect knowledge a mutual conflict of men's opinions is\nimpossible. But that cognitions founded on reasoning do conflict is generally\nknown; for we continually observe that what one logician endeavours to\nestablish as perfect knowledge is demolished by another, who, in his turn, is\ntreated alike by a third. How therefore can knowledge, which is founded on\nreasoning, and whose object is not something permanently uniform, be perfect\nknowledge?--Nor can it be said that he who maintains the\n\np. 317\n\npradhana to be the cause of the world (i.e. the Sa _n_ khya) is the best of\nall reasoners, and accepted as such by all philosophers; which would enable us\nto accept his opinion as perfect knowledge.--Nor can we collect at a given\nmoment and on a given spot all the logicians of the past, present, and future\ntime, so as to settle (by their agreement) that their opinion regarding some\nuniform object is to be considered perfect knowledge. The Veda, on the other\nhand, which is eternal and the source of knowledge, may be allowed to have for\nits object firmly established things, and hence the perfection of that\nknowledge which is founded on the Veda cannot be denied by any of the\nlogicians of the past, present, or future. We have thus established the\nperfection of this our knowledge which reposes on the Upanishads, and as apart\nfrom it perfect knowledge is impossible, its disregard would lead to 'absence\nof final release' of the transmigrating souls. Our final position therefore\nis, that on the ground of Scripture and of reasoning subordinate to Scripture,\nthe intelligent Brahman is to be considered the cause and substance of the\nworld.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[315:1](sbe34150.htm#fr_279) The whole style of argumentation of the Mima _m_\nsa would be p. 216 impossible, if all reasoning were sound; for then no\npurvapaksha view could be maintained.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 12](sbe34151.htm)\n\n"
