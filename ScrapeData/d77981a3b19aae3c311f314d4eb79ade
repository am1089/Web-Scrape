The Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O son of Lomahar _s_ a _n_ a, O Suta; you have\ndescribed to us how the eight Vasus, cursed by Vas'i _st_ ha, took their birth\nand how Bhisma was born. O knower of Dharma! Now describe to us in detail how\nthe greatly religious king S\xc2\x92antanu married the auspicious Yojanagandha, the\nchaste Satyavati, the mother of Vyasa,\n\n\n\np. 91\n\n\n\nknowing full well that she was a fisherman's daughter? O Suvrata! Remove our\nthis doubt. Suta then said :-- The sage king S\xc2\x92antanu always used to go to\nforests on hunting expeditions, with his heart addicted to hunting buffaloes,\ndeer and various other wild animals.\n\n\n\nThus, for four years that king went out a hunting, with his son Bhisma, deer\nand other wild animals and got the highest happiness as Mahadeva finds in\ncompany with Kartikeya. Once, on an occasion, while he was shooting arrows at\nrhinoceros and boar, etc., he went so far as to reach a forest on the banks of\nthe Yamuna, the chief of the rivers. There he began to smell an excellent nice\nsmell that could not be described in words; he tried to find out the source\nand wandered here and there, and on all sides of the forest; and thought that\nthis enchanting smell was not that of Mandara flowers, musk, champaka nor that\nof Malati nor that of Ketaki flower; the air was blowing saturated with\npeculiar fragrant smell that he never experienced before. Thus thinking of\nthat smell, the king S\xc2\x92antanu, being enchanted with that, followed to its\nsource in that forest. At last he came to a spot on the banks of the Yamuna\nthe chief of the rivers, where a very beautiful girl, calm and quiet and with\nfeminine gestures and posture amorous, lovely but ill-clad, was sitting; and\nhe found out that the above beautiful smell was coming out of her body. The\nform of the lady was extremely beautiful; the smell was very wonderful, and\ncaptivating the hearts of all; her age then entered to youth and she was very\nauspicious. The king was greatly surprised and was eager to know who the lady\nwas; whence she had come; whether she was a Deva girl, or a human or a\nGandarbha daughter or a Naga daughter? But, being unable to come to a definite\nconclusion and becoming passionate, he remembered Ganga and asked that lady\nsitting on the bank of the Yumna, thus :-- \xc2\x93O dear! Who are you? Whose\ndaughter are you? Why are you alone in this lovely forest? O beautiful eyed!\nAre you married? Or are you as yet unmarried? So answer to all these. O lovely\neyed one! Seeing your lovely enchanting form I am become extremely passionate.\nSo, O dear! Describe in detail to me, who are you? and what do you intend to\ndo?\xc2\x94 When the king spoke thus the lotus eyed nice-teethed lady replied as\nfollows :-- \xc2\x93O king! Know me as a fisherman's daughter and I am completely\nunder my father's command. O king of kings! For Dharma's sake I carry ferry\nacross this Yumna river. My father has gone to-day to our house. O Master of\nwealth! Thus I have spoken truth to you.\xc2\x94 Thus saying the lady desisted; the\npassionate king then spoke to her :-- \xc2\x93I am the foremost hero of the Kuru\nfamily; so choose me as your husband; then your this youth will not go in\nvain.\n\n\n\np. 92\n\n\n\n21-32. O fawn-eyed one! I have no other wife existing; so you will be my legal\nwife. O Dear! Passion is giving much pains to me; therefore I am now become\nyour obedient servant for ever. O Beloved! My former dear wife has abandoned\nme and gone away; but I have not married since then. Now seeing you beautiful,\nin all respects, I cannot bring my mind under control.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHearing these nectar-like beautiful words of the king, the sweet scented\nfisherman's daughter, though also turned extremely passionate, held patience\nand exclaimed :-- \xc2\x93O king! I also desire that which you have expressed; I am\nof opinion to act according to your wishes. But, what am I to do? I am not\ndependent. You are to know this. My father alone can give me in marriage to\nyou. So better ask my father for me. Though I am a fisherman's daughter, still\nI am not wanton and wilful. I am always obedient to my father; if my father\nwills, you can marry me. And I will be obedient to you. O king! The god of\nlove is tormenting me, who is endowed with youth; he does not torment you so\nmuch. Still I must regard my family manners and customs coming down from\nancient times. I must hold my patience.\xc2\x94 Suta said :-- Thus passionately\npleased with these fascinating words of the lady, the king went to the\nfisherman's house for the lady. Seeing the king coming, the fisherman was\ngreatly bewildered and astonished and bowed down with great devotion and said\n:-- \xc2\x93O King! I am Thy servant. I am blessed by Thy presence. O great King! Now\nbe graciously pleased to order me the cause of Thy arrival.\xc2\x94 Hearing the\nfisherman's words, the King said :-- \xc2\x93O sinless one! This I tell you truly\nthat if you give me your daughter in marriage I will certainly make her my\nlegal wife.\xc2\x94 The fisherman replied :-- \xc2\x93O king! What must be given ever, how\ncan I say that is not to be given. Therefore if Thou askest for my daughter, I\nwill certainly give her to Thee. But, O great King! Thou wilt have to make her\nson, the king of Thy kingdom; no other son of Thine could be king, after Thy\nabsence.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n33-40. Hearing these words of the fisherman, the king S\xc2\x92antanu became very\nanxious. He remembered Gangeya and could not speak anything. He, being sick\nwith love anxiously returned home; but he abandoned bathing, fooding,\nsleeping, etc. At this, the son Gangeya Bhisma whose vow was equal to that of\nthe gods, marking that the king was being troubled with some thought, went to\nhim and asked why he was anxious :-- \xc2\x93O king! Say truly what is your anxiety;\nwho is your enemy that is not conquered; whom do you went to bring under your\ncontrol? O king! What use is there of having a son who does\n\n\n\np. 93\n\n\n\nnot understand the difficulties of his father, or does not try to remove these\ndifficulties. A son can be called really the son, who is born to repay the\ndebts incurred by him in previous births; there is no manner of discussion in\nthis. See, Raghu's son Dasarathi Ram abandoned his kingdom under the orders of\nhis father and repaired to Chitrakuta forest with his brother Lak _s_ man and\nwife Sita. The son of king Haris Chandra, Rohita, ready to repay the debt of\nhis father and sold by his father, worked as a servant at a Brahma _n_ a's\nhouse. So the famous S\xc2\x92unahs'ephah, sold by his high souled father Ajigarta\nwas tied for sacrifice in a sacrificial post; but he was afterwards freed by\nthe Gadhi's son Vis'vamitra.\n\n\n\n41-59. It is well known that, in ancient days, the Jamadagni's son Paras'uram\ncut off his mother's head under the orders of his father. He considered the\nfather's words more important, and hence could do such an unjust act. O king!\nThis my body is at your disposal; I can certainly do what you order me to do.\nSo say what am I to do? as long as I am living, you need not express any\nsorrow; if you permit, I will do what is even hardly practicable to do. O\nking! Say why __ you are anxious; I will remove that at once with this bow in\nmy hand. If my body goes in carrying your mandate know that your desire will\nbe fructified. Fie to that son, who, being capable, is averse to do what his\nfather desires! What use is there in having a son who does not remove the\ncause of his father's anxiety? Hearing the words of the son, the king S\xc2\x92antanu\nfelt much ashamed in his heart and said :-- \xc2\x93O son! This is now my gravest\ncare that you are my only son; besides you are a hero very powerful, honoured\nand never showing your back in battles; therefore, if, out of ill-luck you\nbecome dead in some battlefield, I will become issueless; under such\ncircumstances what am I to do? So, O son! My life is fruitless when I have got\nonly one son; this is my gravest care; therefore I am sorry. O son! I have no\nother cares that I can mention to you.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of the father,\nGangeya called the old ministers and said that the king was too ashamed to\nspeak out to me the real matter; so I ask you all to know exactly the king's\ncares and communicate them to me as they are; I can carry them out, without\nany hitch, then. At these Bhisma's words, the ministers went to the king, and\nlearned the true cause, and spoke to Bhisma; learning this, he began to think\nwhat ought to be done.\n\n\n\nThe Ganga's son Bhisma, then, accompanied by the ministers, quickly went to\nthe house of the fisherman, and with words of humility and affection, spoke\n:-- \xc2\x93O tormentor of foes! I pray to you to give your beautiful daughter in\nmarriage to my father. Your daughter will\n\n\n\n\n\nbe my mother and I will be her servant.\xc2\x94 The fisherman, then, said :-- \xc2\x93O\nhighly lucky prince! Then the king's son will not be able to become king, in\nyour presence; so kindly marry yourself my daughter.\xc2\x94 At this Bhisma again\nsaid :-- Let your daughter be my mother; I will never accept the kingdom. The\nson of your daughter will, no doubt, become king. The fisherman said :-- \xc2\x93I\nknow your words are true; but if your son be powerful, he can take forcibly\nthe kingdom for himself.\xc2\x94 At this Bhisma again said :-- \xc2\x93O Sire! Know my words\nas true; I will never marry; from to-day I have accepted this difficult vow.\xc2\x94\nSuta said :-- Hearing this firm resolve of Bhisma; the fisherman gave over his\nbeautiful daughter to the king S\xc2\x92antanu. Thus S\xc2\x92antanu married the dear\nSatyavati; but he was quite unaware of the wonderful birth of Vyasa Deva.\n\n\n\nThus ends the fifth Chapter of the second Skandha on the marriage of Satyavati\nin the Mahapura _n_ a S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk02ch06.htm)\n\n"
