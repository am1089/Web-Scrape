[1882], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n2:5:4\n\n### FOURTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n2:5:4:11\\. Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew V _ri_ tra 3;\nby means of it they gained that supreme authority which they now wield; and so\ndoes he (the Sacrificer) thereby now slay his wicked, spiteful enemy, and gain\nthe victory: this is why he performs this sacrifice.\n\n2:5:4:22\\. The mode of its performance (is as follows): They raise an uttara-\nvedi 4; they use clotted butter 5; and they churn the fire. There are nine\n\np. 418\n\nfore-offerings and nine after-offerings 1, and three Samish _t_ aya _g_ us. In\nthe first place there are those five oblations 2.\n\n2:5:4:33\\. Now as to why there is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni. With\nAgni, (shaped into) a sharp point (te _g_ as) 3, indeed, they (the gods) slew\nhim (V _ri_ tra); and Agni, that sharp point, swerved not: hence there is (a\ncake) for Agni.\n\n2:5:4:44\\. Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Soma. With the aid of Soma,\nthe king, indeed they slew him, they who have Soma for their king: hence there\nis a pap for Soma.\n\n2:5:4:55\\. Then as to why there is a cake on twelve, or eight 4, potsherds for\nSavit _ri_. Savit _ri_ , indeed, is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the gods;\nand impelled by Savit _ri_ they slew him: hence there is (a cake) for Savit\n_ri_.\n\n2:5:4:66\\. Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Sarasvati. Sarasvati in\ntruth is Speech; and Speech indeed it was that cheered them up, saying,\n'Strike! slay 5!' Hence there is a pap for Sarasvati.\n\n2:5:4:77\\. Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Pushan. Pushan doubtless is\nthis earth 6, and this\n\np. 419\n\nearth, indeed, gave him (V _ri_ tra) up to slaughter; and they slew him, thus\ngiven up by her: hence there is a rice-pap for Pushan.\n\n2:5:4:88\\. Then follows a cake on twelve, potsherds for Indra and Agni; for by\nmeans of that they slew him, since Agni means fiery glow (te _g_ as), and\nIndra means manly power, and by means of these two powers they did indeed slay\nhim. Moreover, Agni is the priesthood, and Indra is the nobility; having\nallied these two, having closely united the priesthood with the nobility, they\n(the gods) slew him by means of these two powers: hence there is a cake on\ntwelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.\n\n2:5:4:99\\. Then follows a rice-part for Mahendra. For before the slaying of V\n_ri_ tra he was indeed Indra; but after slaying V _ri_ tra he became Mahendra\n(the great Indra), even as (a king becomes) a mahara _g_ a, after obtaining\nthe victory: hence there is a rice-pap for Mahendra. And thereby indeed he\nrenders him great (strong), for the slaying of V _ri_ tra: for this reason\nalso there is a rice-pap for Mahendra.\n\n2:5:4:1010\\. Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Vi _s_ vakarman. To the\ngods, indeed, on performing the Sakamedha-sacrifice and obtaining the victory\n(over V _ri_ tra), that sacred work (karman) was made complete (vi _s_ va),\nand all was conquered; and so is that sacred work made complete, and all is\nconquered, by him who has performed the Sakamedha-sacrifice and obtained the\nvictory: hence there is a cake on one potsherd for Vi _s_ vakarman.\n\n2:5:4:1111\\. And, verily, by performing this sacrifice the gods became what\nrace, what prosperity of the gods there now is; and that same race he\npropagates,\n\np. 420\n\nthat same prosperity he attains, whosoever, knowing this, performs this\nsacrifice. Let him therefore perform this sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[417:3](sbe1259.htm#fr_933) See [p. 416](sbe1258.htm#page_416), note\n[1](sbe1258.htm#fn_925).\n\n[417:4](sbe1259.htm#fr_934) See [p. 392](sbe1257.htm#page_392), note\n[1](sbe1257.htm#fn_879). The southern altar is not required at the present\nceremony.\n\n[417:5](sbe1259.htm#fr_935) See [p. 404](sbe1257.htm#page_404), note\n[1](sbe1257.htm#fn_896).\n\n[418:1](sbe1259.htm#fr_936) See II, 5, 2, 30 and 41.\n\n[418:2](sbe1259.htm#fr_937) See II, 5, 1, 11, with note 9.\n\n[418:3](sbe1259.htm#fr_938) See II, 5, 3, 2. This cake, again, is to be\nprepared (or offered) simultaneously with the rising of the sun; see [p.\n409](sbe1258.htm#page_409) note.\n\n[418:4](sbe1259.htm#fr_939) According to Taitt. S. I, 8, 4 it is to be one on\ntwelve potsherds.\n\n[418:5](sbe1259.htm#fr_940) The Ka _n_ va text has, 'Attack (abhipadyasva)!\nstrike! slay!'\n\n[418:6](sbe1259.htm#fr_941) This identification of Pushan with the earth is\nvery strange, the more so as, at II, 5, 1, 11, special stress is laid on the\nmale nature of Pushan. Perhaps it is in his character of bountiful bestower of\nfood and cattle, or as the tutelary god of travellers, that he is so\nidentified.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 6, 1. Sixth Adhyaya.
