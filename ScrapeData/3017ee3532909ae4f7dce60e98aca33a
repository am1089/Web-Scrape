And on account of both being directly declared.\n\nThe conclusion arrived at above is based not only on scriptural declaration,\nillustrative instances and statements of reflection; but in addition Scripture\ndirectly states that Brahman alone is the material as well as operative cause\nof the world. 'What was the wood, what the tree from which they have shaped\nheaven and earth? You wise ones, search in your minds, whereon it stood,\nsupporting the worlds.--Brahman was the wood, Brahman the tree from which they\nshaped heaven and earth; you wise ones, I tell you, it stood on Brahman,\nsupporting the worlds.'--Here a question is asked, suggested by the ordinary\nworldly view, as to what was the material and instruments used by Brahman when\ncreating; and the answer--based on the insight that there is nothing\nunreasonable in ascribing all possible powers to Brahman which differs from\nall other beings--declares that Brahman itself is the material\n\np. 402\n\nand the instruments;--whereby the ordinary view is disposed of.--The next\nSutra supplies a further reason.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 26.
