Those who setting aside the ordinance of the Shastra, perform sacrifice\nwith Shraddha, what is their condition, O Krishna? (Is it) Sattva, Rajas or\nTamas? 1\n\np. 350\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n2\\. Threefold is the Shraddha of the embodied, which is inherent in their\nnature,--the Sattvika, the Rajasika and the Tamasika. Do thou hear of it. 2\n\np. 351\n\n3\\. The Shraddha of each is according to his natural disposition, O descendant\nof Bharata. The man consists of his Shraddha; he verily is what his Shraddha\nis. 3\n\n4\\. Sattvika men worship the Devas; Rajasika, the Yakshas and the Rakshasas;\nthe others--the Tamasika men--the Pretas and the hosts of Bhutas.\n\np. 352\n\n5-6. Those men who practise severe austerities not enjoined by the Shastras,\ngiven to ostentation and egoism, possessed with the power of lust and\nattachment, torture, senseless as they are, all the organs in the body, and Me\ndwelling in the body within; know them to be of Asurika resolve. 5\n\np. 353\n\n7\\. The food also which is liked by each of them is threefold, as also Yajna,\nausterity and almsgiving. Do thou hear this, their distinction.\n\n8\\. The foods which augment vitality, energy, strength, health, cheerfulness\nand appetite, which are savoury and oleaginous, substantial and\n[agreeable](errata.htm#4), are liked by the Sattvika.\n\np. 354\n\n9\\. The foods that are bitter, sour, saline, excessively hot, pungent, dry and\nburning, are liked by the Rajasika, and are productive of pain, grief and\ndisease. 9\n\n10\\. That which is stale, tasteless, stinking, cooked overnight, refuse and\nimpure, is the food liked by the Tamasika. 10\n\n[\n\np. 355\n\n11\\. That Yajna is Sattvika which is performed by men desiring no fruit, as\nenjoined by ordinance, with their mind fixed on the Yajna only, for its own\nsake.\n\n12\\. That which is performed, O best of the Bharatas, seeking for fruit and\nfor ostentation, know it to be a Rajasika Yajna.\n\np. 356\n\n13\\. The Yajna performed without heed to ordinance, in which no food is\ndistributed, which is devoid of Mantras, gifts, and Shraddha, is said to be\nTamasika.\n\n14\\. Worship of the Devas, the twice-born, the Gurus and the wise, purity,\nstraightforwardness, continence, and non-injury are called the austerity of\nthe body.\n\n15\\. Speech which causes no vexation, and is true, as also agreeable and\nbeneficial, and regular study of the Vedas,--\n\np. 357\n\nthese are said to form the austerity of speech. 15\n\n16\\. Serenity of mind, kindliness, silence, self-control, honesty of motive,--\nthis is called the mental austerity. 16\n\np. 358\n\n17\\. This threefold austerity practised by steadfast men, with great Shraddha,\ndesiring no fruit, is said to be Sattvika. 17\n\n18\\. That austerity which is practised with the object of gaining welcome,\nhonour and worship, and with ostentation, is here said to be Rajasika,\nunstable and transitory. 18\n\np. 359\n\n19\\. That austerity which is practised out of a foolish notion, with self-\ntorture or for the purpose of wining another, is declared to be Tamasika.\n\n20\\. To give is right, gift given with this idea, to one who does no service\nin return, in a fit place and to a worthy person, that gift is held to be\nSattvika. 20\n\np. 360\n\n21\\. And what is given with a view to receiving in return, or looking for the\nfruit, or again reluctantly, that gift is held to be Rajasika.\n\n22\\. The gift that is given at the wrong place or time, to unworthy persons,\nwithout regard or with disdain, that is declared to be Tamasika.\n\n23\\. "Om, Tat, Sat": this has been declared to be the triple designation of\nBrahman. By that were made of old the Brahmanas, the Vedas and the Yajnas. 23\n\np. 361\n\n24\\. Therefore, uttering \'Om,\' are the acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity\nas enjoined in the ordinances, always begun by the followers of the Vedas.\n\n25\\. Uttering Tat, without aiming at fruits, are the various acts of Yajna,\nausterity and gift performed by the seekers of Moksha.\n\np. 362\n\n26\\. The word Sat is used in the sense of reality and of goodness; and so\nalso, Partha, the word Sat is used in the sense of an auspicious act.\n\n27\\. Steadiness in Yajna, austerity and gift is also called \'Sat\': as also\naction in connection with these (or, action for the sake of the Lord) is\ncalled Sat.\n\np. 363\n\n28\\. Whatever is sacrificed, given or performed, and whatever austerity is\npractised without Shraddha, it is called Asat, O Partha; it is naught here or\nhereafter. 28\n\n\n\nThe end of the Seventeenth Chapter designated: The Enquiry into the Threefold\nShraddha.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[349:1](sbg22.htm#fr_343) _Setting . . . Shraddh a:_ not that they believe the\nordinance of the Shastra to be false, but out of laziness or because of the\ndifficulty in adhering to p. 350 them strictly, they let them alone and\nworship the gods, endued with Shraddha.\n\n[350:2](sbg22.htm#fr_344) _Inherent . . . nature:_ born of their past\nSamskaras. It--the threefold Shraddha.\n\n[351:3](sbg22.htm#fr_345) Natural disposition--the specific tendencies or\nSamskaras.\n\n[352:5](sbg22.htm#fr_346) _Austerities_ --which cause pain to himself and to\nother living beings.\n\n_Possessed attachment_ --may also be interpreted as, \'possessed of lust,\nattachment and power.\'\n\n_All the organs of the body:_ the aggregate of all the elements composing the\nbody.\n\n[354:9](sbg22.htm#fr_347) _Excessively_ --this word should be construed with\neach of the seven; thus, excessively bitter, excessively sour, and so on.\n\n[354:10](sbg22.htm#fr_348) _Stale_ --Yatayamam--lit. cooked three hours ago.\n\n_Refuse:_ left on the plate after a meal.\n\n[357:15](sbg22.htm#fr_349) Speech, to be an austerity, must form an invariable\ncombination of all the four attributes mentioned in the Sloka; if it lacks in\none or other of them, it will no longer be an austerity of speech.\n\n[357:16](sbg22.htm#fr_350) _Silence_ --Maunam--is the result of the control of\nthought so far as it concerns speech. Or it may mean, the condition of the\nMuni, _i.e._ , practice of meditation.\n\n[358:17](sbg22.htm#fr_351) _Steadfast_ --unaffected in success and failure.\n\n[358:18](sbg22.htm#fr_352) _With ostentation:_ for mere show, hypocritically,\nwith no sincere belief.\n\n_Here_ --is explained also in the sense of \'of this world,\' _i.e._ , yielding\nfruit only in this world.\n\n[359:20](sbg22.htm#fr_353) _Who . . . return:_ one who cannot, or who though\nable is not expected to return the good.\n\n[360:23](sbg22.htm#fr_354) Om, Tat, Sat: Om is the principal name of p. 361the\nLord, because it means all that is manifest and the beyond. It also means\n"Yes." Tat means "That"; the Indefinable, that which can only be described\nindirectly as "That which." Sat means Reality; which is ever permanent in one\nmode of being.\n\n[363:28](sbg22.htm#fr_355) _It is naught here or hereafter:_ Though costing\nmuch trouble it is of no use here as it is not acceptable to the wise ones,\nnor can it produce any effect conducive to good hereafter.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Eighteenth Chapter.
