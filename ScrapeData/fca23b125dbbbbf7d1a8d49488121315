Prayer for long life pronounced over a boy.\n\n1\\. For thee alone, O (death from) old age, this (boy) shall grow up: the\nother hundred kinds of death shall not harm him! Like a provident mother in\nher lap Mitra shall befriend him, shall save him from misfortune!  \n2\\. May Mitra or Varuna, the illustrious, cooperating, grant him death from\nold age! Then Agni, the priest, who knows the ways, promulgates all the races\nof the gods.  \n3\\. Thou, (O Agni), rulest over all the animals of the earth, those which have\nbeen born, and those which are to be born: may not in-breathing leave this\none, nor yet out-breathing, may neither friends nor foes slay him!  \n4\\. May father Dyaus (sky) and mother Prithivi (earth), co-operating, grant\nthee death from old age, that thou mayest live in the lap of Aditi a hundred\nwinters, guarded by in-breathing and outbreathing!  \n5\\. Lead this dear child to life and vigour, O Agni, Varuna, and king Mitra!\nAs a mother afford him protection, O Aditi, and all ye gods, that he may\nattain to old age!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 31.
