Charm to ward off danger from fire.\n\n1\\. Where thou comest, (O fire), and where thou goest away, the blooming\ndurva-plant shall grow: a well-spring there shall rise up, or a lotus-laden\npool!  \n2\\. Here (shall be) the gathering place of the waters, here the dwelling-place\nof the sea! In the midst of a pond our house shall be: turn, (O fire), away\nthy jaws!  \nWith a covering of coolness do we envelop thee, O house; cool as a pond be\nthou for us! Agni shall furnish the remedy!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3. Shepherd's charm against wild beasts and robbers](av176.htm)\n\n"
