He who has been established as the steward among the mortals, the\nimmortal, righteous one, and among the gods, being a god himself, the Hot _ri_\n, the best sacrificer shall mightily flame [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:1:1); Agni\nshall rise up [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:1:1) with the offerings of Manus.\n\n2\\. Here, O Agni, son of strength, thou goest for us to-day as a messenger,\nthou who art born, between the two races (of men and gods), having harnessed,\nO tall one, thy puissant, manly, brilliant (stallions)\n[1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:2:1).\n\n3\\. Harnessing the two mighty, red steeds that swim in ghee--(the steeds) of\n_Ri_ ta, I think, that are most swift with their mind\n[1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:3:1), the ruddy ones, thou goest (as a messenger)\nbetween you, the gods, and the tribes of men [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:3:2).\n\n4\\. O Agni, with thy good horses, and thy good chariot, rich in bounties,\nbring hither from among them (the gods) [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:4:1) Aryaman,\nVaru _n_ a, and Mitra, Indra and Vish _n_ u, the Maruts and the A _s_ vins, to\nhim who offers good oblations.\n\n5\\. This sacrifice, O Agni, is rich in cows [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:5:1), in\nsheep and horses, in manly friends; it is never to be despised; it is rich in\nnourishment, O wonderful lord [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:5:2), rich in offspring;\nit is long-lasting wealth, broad-based, with (brilliant) assemblies.\n\n6 [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:6:1). Be a self-strong protector, O Agni, of the man\nwho in the sweat of his brow brings fuel to thee [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:6:2),\nor heats his head desirous to worship thee. Deliver him from every harmful\nman.\n\np. 317\n\n7\\. The man who brings food to thee who art desirous of food, he who stirs up\n[1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:7:1) the cheerful guest and rouses him, the godly man\nwho kindles thee in his dwelling: to him may belong lasting and generous\nwealth.\n\n8\\. The sacrificer who praises thee in the evening and in the morning and\ngratifies thee; that liberal man thou shouldst bring across all distress, like\na well-impelled horse [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:8:1), (dwelling) in his house.\n\n9\\. The man who worships thee, the immortal one, O Agni, and who honours thee,\nholding the sacrificial ladle--may he, the toiling (sacrificer), not be\ndeprived of wealth; may no distress that comes from a harmful (foe), surround\nhim.\n\n10\\. That mortal whose well-ordered sacrifice thou, as the god, acceptest, O\nAgni, as a liberal giver, may his worship [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:10:1) be\nwelcome, O youngest god, (the Hot _ri_ 's work performed) for a worshipper\nwhose helpers we may be.\n\n11\\. May he, the knowing one, distinguish wisdom and folly of mortals\n[1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:11:1), like straight and crooked backs (of horses)\n[2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:11:2). And for the sake of wealth and noble offspring,\nO god, grant us Diti and keep off Aditi [3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:11:3).\n\n12\\. The undeceived sages instructed the sage (Agni), setting him down in the\ndwellings of \xc3\x82yu [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:12:1). Hence mayst thou behold, O\nAgni, with thy eyes [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:12:2) these beings visible and\nsecret (that move) on the Arya's ways [3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:12:3).\n\n13\\. Bring thou, O Agni, youngest (god), who art a good guide, a plentiful,\nbrilliant treasure to the worshipper who presses Soma, who serves thee and\ntoils, to help him, O brisk one, who fillest the dwellings of peoples.\n\n14 [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:14:1). And whatsoever we have done, O Agni, out\n\np. 318\n\nof devotion for thee, with our feet [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:14:2), with our\nhands, with our bodies: (in those deeds of ours) the wise have held up the\n_Ri_ ta, aspiring after it, like those who manage a chariot by means of the\ntwo pole-arms (?) [3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:14:3).\n\n15\\. And may we be born from the Dawn, the mother, as the seven priests\n[1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:15:1), as the first worshippers among men\n[2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:15:2). May we be the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, the sons of Heaven. May\nwe flaming break the rock which contains the prize of the contest\n[3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:15:3).\n\n16\\. And as our first, ancient fathers, O Agni, were aspiring after _Ri_ ta\n[1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:16:1)--they attained to pure devotion\n[2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:16:2), chanting their litanies. Cleaving the earth\nthey disclosed the red (cows).\n\n17\\. The pious men, well performing the acts (of worship), resplendent,\nmelting [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:17:1) the generations of the gods\n[2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:17:2) like ore [3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:17:3), kindling\nAgni, strengthening Indra, went along [4](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:17:4), besieging\nthe stall of cows.\n\n18\\. He looked (on the gods) as on herds of cattle\n[1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:1) in a rich (pasture)\n[2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:2), when the generations of the gods (were) near\nhim, O mighty one [3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:3). After (the generations) of\nthe mortals the Urva _s_ is [4](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:4) have pined, for the\ngrowing strong of the Arya [5](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:5), of the nearer \xc3\x82yu\n[6](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:6).\n\n19\\. We have done our work for thee; we have been good workers--the brilliant\ndawns have shone out _Ri_ ta [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:19:1),--brightening\n[2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:19:2) the perfect Agni who manifoldly shines with fine\nsplendour, (brightening) the god's beautiful eye.\n\n20\\. We have recited these hymns for thee, the sage, O Agni, worshipper (of\nthe gods) [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:20:1); accept them! Blaze up; make us\nwealthier. Bestow great wealth on us, O bountiful one!\n\np. 319\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Vamadeva, the metre Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 5 = TS. I, 6, 6, 4;\nIII, 1, 11, 1; MS. I, 4, 3. Verse 6 = T\xc3\x82. VI, 2, 1. Verse 11 = TS. V, 5, 4, 4.\nVerse 16 = VS. XIX, 69; TS. II, 6, 12, 4. Verses 16-19 = AV. XVIII, 3, 21-24.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. On this use of these infinitives, comp. Delbruck, Altindische Syntax,\np. 412.--Manusha _h_ seems to be genitive; comp. II, 2, 6. havya\xc2\xb4 manusha _h_\n; II, 2, 8. hotrabhi _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 manusha _h_ ; I, 76, 5. manusha _h_ havirbhi _h_.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. below, IV, 6, 9.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. As to the horses of _Ri_ ta, comp. above, III, 6, 6. In spite of the\ndifferent accent there is no doubt that gh _ri_ tasnuva, which occurs in that\nverse, is the same word as gh _ri_ tasnu, in our verse, a compound of gh _ri_\nta with a noun snu which seems to be different from sa\xc2\xb4nu, and connected with\nthe root sna (cf. gh _ri_ tasna\xc2\xb4, IV, 6, 9; and see Bechtel, Hauptprobleme der\nIndogerm. Lautlehre, p. 211). V _ri_ dhasnu, on the other hand, seems to be no\ncompound, but an adjective formed like vadhasnu, nishatsnu. It is evident,\nhowever, that the poet here employed the two words v _ri_ dhasnu and gh _ri_\ntasnu as parallel expressions.\n\nNote 2. Read martam (for martan; gen. plur.). Comp. below, verse 11; VI, 47,\n16. vi _s_ a _h_ manushy\xcc\x86an, where we ought to read manushy\xcc\x83am. See Lanman, p.\n353; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, p. 44; Bartholomae, Studien zur\nIndogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, I, p. 48.\n\np. 320\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. 'Could it be Mitram esham, the rapid Mitra?' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The meaning is, it is rich in reward consisting in cows, &c.\n\nNote 2. The text has asura. Cf. H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 164.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. With the first Pada, comp. below, 12, 2.\n\nNote 2. On svatavan, see Benfey, Vedica and Linguistica, p. 1 seqq.; Lanman,\np. 559; Joh. Schmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVI, p. 357 seq.; H. O.,\nProlegomena, p. 471.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Ni _s_ ishat is not derived, as is the case for instance with a\xc2\xb4 _s_\nishamahi, VIII, 24, 1, from (ni-) _s_ as (Grassmann, Ludwig), but from ni- _s_\na (Bohtlingk-Roth); comp. VII, 3, 5. ni _s_ i _s_ ana _h_ atithim. We must\nread, consequently, ni _s_ i _s_ at, formed like dadhat (3rd sg. subj. pres.,\nor possibly nom. sing. part. pres.).\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Bohtlingk-Roth conjecture harmya\xc2\xb4van 'im Hause, im Stall gehalten.' It\nis true that beasts may be kept in the harmya; comp. VII, 56, 16; X, 106, 5;\nZimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 149. But I do not think that 'being kept in the\nharmya' could be expressed by harmya-vat. Hemya\xc2\xb4vat seems to be derived from\nthe root hi, and to have the same meaning as a _s_ uheman; such a word very\nwell fits into a phrase referring to a swift horse. Hemya\xc2\xb4vat stands to heman\nin the same relation as omya\xc2\xb4vat to oman. All this was pointed out first by\nLudwig (vol. iv, p. 22).\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Literally the Hot _ri_ 's work (performed for such a Ya _g_ amana).\n\np. 321\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. I read martam (gen. plur.); comp. above, verse 3, note 2. It is\npossible, however, to leave the text unchanged; in this case the translation\nwould be: 'May he, the knowing one, distinguish wisdom and folly, the (wise\nand foolish) mortals like straight and crooked backs (of horses).'\n\nNote 2. Comp. vitap _ri_ sh _th_ a, 'straight-backed,' a frequent epithet of\nhorses.\n\nNote 3. For Prof. Max Muller's interpretation of this passage, comp. vol.\nxxxii, p. 256. See also Bergaigne, Rel. Vedique, III, 97; Pischel, Vedische\nStudien, I, 297 seq. It is very strange that the poet should ask the god to\nkeep off Aditi (comp. I, 152, 6. aditim urushyet) who must here be considered,\nconsequently, as a malevolent deity. I think that this conception of Aditi is\nderived from the idea of this goddess as punishing sin; it is the same goddess\nwho may free the sinner from the bonds of sin and who may fetter and destroy\nhim. Keeping off Aditi seems to mean, consequently, removing from the mortal\nthe danger of being bound by the fetters of sin; the idea is the same as above\nin IV, 1, 5, where Agni is invoked to make Varu _n_ a, the son of Aditi, go\naway (comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 336, note 1). In that case granting\nDiti would mean granting freedom from those same fetters. (On Diti, who very\nappropriately has been called a mere reflex of Aditi, see M. M., loc. cit.;\nBergaigne, III, 97 seq.)\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. On \xc3\x82yu, the mythical ancestor of the human race, see Bergaigne,\nReligion Vedique, I, p. 59 seq.\n\nNote 2. On pa _d_ bhi _h_ , comp. Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 228 seq.;\nBartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XV, 3 seq.; Bloomfield, Contributions to\nthe Interpretation of the Veda, Second Series, p. 32 seq. (American Journal of\nPhilology, XI, 350 seq.). I believe that in our verse pa _d_ bhi _h_ should be\nderived from a noun pa _s_ , and translated, 'with thy eyes,'\n\np. 322\n\nwhile in verse 14 we ought to read padbhi _h_ , and to translate, 'with the\nfeet.'\n\nNote 3. Pischel (Ved. Studien, I, 229, note I) believes that arya _h_ is nom.\nsing., referring to Agni. But compare VI, 51, 2. ri _g_ u marteshu v _ri_ _g_\nina\xc2\xb4 _k_ a pa _s_ yan abhi _k_ ash _t_ e su\xc2\xb4ra _h_ arya _h_ evan. This verse\nmakes it very probable that arya _h_ is a genitive dependent on evai _h_ ,\nevan ('beholding right and wrong deeds among the mortals, the Sun looks upon\nthe Arya's ways'). On the stem ari, 'the Arya,' see Pischel, Zeitschrift der\nDeutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, XL, p. 125.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. This verse has been commented upon by Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 229\nseq.\n\nNote 2. On pa _d_ bhi _h_ or rather padbhi _h_ , comp. verse 12, note 2.\n\nNote 3. In translating bhuri _g_ I have followed, though not without doubt,\nthe theory of Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 239 seq.--Pischel seems to be right in\nmaking ritam depend both on yemu _h_ (comp. IV, 23, 10) and on a _s_ ushana\xc2\xb4\n_h_ (comp. above, IV, 1, 13, and below, verse 16).\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. The seven _Ri_ shis or A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, the sons of Heaven and the Dawn (cf.\nabove 1, 16).\n\nNote 2. n _r i\xc2\xb4_n (or rather n _r i\xc2\xb4_m) is genitive plural. See Lanman, p.\n430; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, p. 42.\n\nNote 3. Here we have again the seven _Ri_ shis breaking the mountain in which\nthe cows were imprisoned.\n\n##### Verse 16.\n\nNote 1. The apodosis is wanting. As verse 15 shows, the meaning is: As our\nfathers have done their mighty deeds, aspiring after _Ri_ ta, thus may we do\nthe same.\n\nNote 2. _S_ u _k_ i\xc2\xb4t (Padap. _s_ u _k_ i it) possibly stands for _s_ ukim it;\ncf. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, XLVIII, p.\n680. Or may we correct _s_ u _k_ i it \xe2\x80\xa6\n\np. 323\n\ndi\xc2\xb4dhiti (instr. sing.), 'they went along in pure devotion'? Di\xc2\xb4dhiti seems to\nbe what is called in III, 31, 1; IX, 102, 1. 8, _ri_ tasya di\xc2\xb4dhiti _h_.'\n\n##### Verse 17.\n\nNote 1. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 252.\n\nNote 2. Evidently the pious men, not the gods, form the subject. I propose to\nread, therefore, deva\xc2\xb4m (gen. plur.) _g_ anima; cf. verse 18 deva\xc2\xb4nam yat _g_\nanima. They kindle Agni; they strengthen Indra: in short, they treat the\ndivine people as the smith treats the metal.\n\nNote 3. I do not enter here upon the archaeological question as to the meaning\nof aya _h_. Comp. on this much-discussed question especially Max Muller,\nBiographies of Words, p. 252 seq.; Schrader, Sprachvergleichung und\nUrgeschichte (2nd ed.), p. 271 seq.; von Bradke, Methode der arischen\nAlterthumswissenschaft, p. 93 seq.\n\nNote 4. Cf. X, 61, 13. parishadvana _h_ agman.\n\n##### Verse 18.\n\nNote 1. Pa _s_ va _h_ is genitive sing.; it depends on yutha\xc2\xb4. Cf. V, 31, 1;\nVI, 19, 3.\n\nNote 2. There is no reason for taking, as Lanman (p. 516) does, kshumati as\nacc. plur. neut., which would be kshuma\xc2\xb4nti. See Joh. Schmidt, Pluralbildungen\nder Indogermanischen Neutra, p. 237; Bartholomae, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXIX, p.\n493. Bartholomae translates, 'bei einem wolhabenden.'\n\nNote 3. Is this vocative ugra right? It would be easy to correct, with Ludwig,\nugra\xc2\xb4 ('when the mighty generations of the gods were near him') or ugra _h_ ,\nas suggested by Delbruck (Grassmann's Translation, vol. i, p. 573): 'the\nmighty one (Agni) looked on them,' &c.\n\nNote 4. I believe that Geldner (Ved. Studien, I, 260, note 1) is right in\ncontending that Urva _s_ i, wherever it occurs, is the name of an Apsaras and\nnothing else. The name of \xc3\x82yu, occurring in the fourth Pada, confirms this;\nfor \xc3\x82yu, as is well known, is the son of Pururavas and of the nymph Urva _s_\ni. Geldner translates, 'Selbst mit den\n\np. 324\n\n[paragraph continues] Sterblichen hatten die Urva _s_ is Mitleid.' But I do\nnot think that k _ri_ p means 'having compassion.' In my opinion we should,\nwith Ludwig, supply _g_ anima to martanam, so that deva\xc2\xb4nam _g_ anima in the\nsecond Pada corresponds with martanam ( _g_ anima) in the third. This _g_\nanima is an accusative which depends on ak _ri_ pran ('they pined after \xe2\x80\xa6,'\ncf. IX, 85, 11. na\xc2\xb4ke supar _n_ am upapaptiva\xc2\xb4 _m_ sam gira _h_ vena\xc2\xb4nam ak\n_ri_ panta purvi\xc2\xb4 _h_ ; X, 74, 3. ye k _ri_ pa _n_ anta ratnam). Thus the\nmeaning seems to be: When the cows had been conquered, and when Agni looked\nover the generations of the gods that were near him, the Urva _s_ is, i. e.\nthe Apsarases such as Urva _s_ i, longed for the love of mortals such as\nPururavas, and for the propagation of the human generations; they gave birth\nto children such as \xc3\x82yu.\n\nNote 5. Or 'of the indigent'? Or is arya _h_ nom. plur. fem. referring to the\nUrva _s_ is? Or nom. sing. masc. referring to Agni?\n\nNote 6. On \xc3\x82yu, see note 4. But I cannot tell why he is called the nearer \xc3\x82yu.\nIs this nearer \xc3\x82yu opposed, as a nearer or later (upara) ancestor, to the\npitara _h_ parasa _h_ pratna\xc2\xb4sa _h_ , the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, mentioned in verse 16? The\nsame nearer \xc3\x82yu (upara which stands there in opposition to pu\xc2\xb4rvabhi _h_ ) is\nmentioned also in I, 104, 4, connected, as it seems, with some Apsarases. I do\nnot pretend to be able to interpret that very difficult verse, but I am\nconvinced that it has been misinterpreted both by Roth (Siebenzig Lieder, p.\nvii) and by Bergaigne (I, 60).\n\n##### Verse 19.\n\nNote 1. I. e. the dawns have sent forth their shine, which is a visible\nmanifestation of the eternal law of _Ri_ ta.\n\nNote 2. The construction is: we have been good workers, brightening &c. The\nwords, 'the brilliant dawns have shone out _Ri_ ta,' are a parenthesis.\n\n##### Verse 20.\n\nNote 1. The text is nearly identical with the first hemistich of I, 73, 10\n(see above).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3](sbe46092.htm)\n\n"
