Now 2 when (the Adhvaryu) says, 'The divine Hot _ri_ s are summoned\nfor the proclamation of success,\n\np. 248\n\nthe human one is called upon for the song of praise (sukta-vaka);' and when\nthe Hot _ri_ thereupon recites, he recites good words only 1: he thereby\ninvokes a blessing on the sacrificer. It is indeed after the sacrifice that he\nthus invokes a blessing. A twofold reason there is for his invoking the\nblessing after the sacrifice.\n\n1:9:1:22\\. He who sacrifices, assuredly, is the producer of the sacrifice,\nsince it is by his order that, the priests spread it, that they produce it. He\n(the Hot _ri_ ) now invokes a blessing; and that blessing invoked by him, the\nsacrifice, on its part, realises for this (sacrificer), knowing as it does\nthat he has produced it. For this reason he invokes a blessing after the\nsacrifice.\n\n1:9:1:33\\. He who sacrifices, assuredly, pleases the gods. Having pleased the\ngods by that sacrifice,--that is, partly by _Ri_ k-verses, partly by Ya _g_\nus-formulas, and partly by oblations,--he obtains a share among them.\n\nWhen he has obtained a share among them, then (the Hot _ri_ ) invokes a\nblessing (on him); and that (blessing, invoked by him, the gods realise for\nthis sacrificer), knowing as they do that he has pleased them. For this reason\nalso he invokes a blessing after the sacrifice.\n\n1:9:1:44\\. He intones 2,--'Successful this has turned out, O heaven and\nearth--,' for successful indeed it has turned out, when one has completed the\nsacrifice.--'We have completed the song of praise, and the\n\np. 249\n\nutterance of worship 1,' for indeed these two, the singing of praises and the\nutterance of worship, form the sacrifice: and accordingly he thereby says, 'We\nhave accomplished the sacrifice, we have obtained possession of the\nsacrifice.'--'Thou, O Agni, art the voice of praise at the listening 2 of\nheaven and earth,' he thereby says to Agni, 'Thou art the voice of praise,\nwhile heaven and earth listen.'--'May heaven and earth be propitious to thee,\nO sacrificer, at this sacrifice!' whereby he says, 'May heaven and earth\nabound in food for thee, O sacrificer, at this sacrifice.'\n\n1:9:1:55\\. 'They, propitious to the cattle 3, profuse in gifts,' he thereby\nsays, 'May they both be propitious to the cattle, and profuse in\ngifts.'--'They, the fearless and inscrutable 4;' he thereby says, 'Mayest thou\nnot be afraid of anybody; may no one obtain before thee this thy wealth!'\n\np. 250\n\n1:9:1:66\\. 'They, of wide abode, the afforders of safety;' he thereby says,\n'May they both be possessed of wide abodes and exempt from danger.'--'They,\nthe rain-skied, the water-pouring,' he thereby says, 'May they both be\npossessed of rain.'\n\n1:9:1:77\\. 'They, the genial and beneficent;' he thereby says, 'May they both\nbe genial and beneficent.'--'They, the rich in sap and substance;' he thereby\nsays, 'May they both abound in moisture and afford the means of subsistence.'\n\n1:9:1:88\\. 'They, of easy access and good abode;' he thereby says, 'May yonder\n(sky), which thou approachest from below, afford thee easy access; may this\n(earth) on which thou abidest (or movest) afford thee good abode.'--'With\ntheir knowledge--,' thereby he says, 'Both of these approving--'\n\n1:9:1:99\\. 'Agni has graciously accepted this oblation, he has grown in\nstrength, he has acquired greater power,' he thereby refers to Agni's butter-\nportion.--'Soma has graciously accepted this oblation, he has grown in\nstrength, he has acquired greater power,' he thereby refers to Soma's butter-\nportion.--'Agni has graciously accepted this oblation, he has grown in\nstrength, he has acquired greater power,' he thereby refers to the\nindispensable cake which is (offered) on both occasions (the new- and full-\nmoon sacrifice).\n\n1:9:1:1010\\. And in the same way according to the respective deities. 'The\nbutter-drinking gods have graciously accepted the butter, they have grown in\nstrength, they have acquired greater power;' thereby he refers to the fore-\nofferings and after-offerings; for the butter-drinking gods truly are the\nfore-offerings and after-offerings.--'Agni, by virtue of his Hot _ri_ -ship,\nhas graciously accepted this oblation, he has\n\np. 251\n\ngrown in strength, the has acquired greater power;' thereby he refers to Agni,\nin virtue of his Hot _ri_ ship. With 'has graciously accepted' the thus\nenumerates those deities to whom offering has been made: in saying 'Such a one\nhas graciously accepted the oblation, such a one has graciously accepted the\noblation,' he accordingly prays for the accomplishment of the sacrifice; for\nwhatever oblation the gods graciously accept, by that he gains great things:\nhence he says, '(he) has graciously accepted it.' And '(he) has grown in\nstrength' he says, because what the gods delight in, they make mountain high:\nfor this reason he says '(he) has increased.'\n\n1:9:1:1111\\. '(He) has acquired (lit. made for himself) greater power' he\nsays; for assuredly the power of the gods is the sacrifice: it is the latter\ntherefore which they make still greater; and for this reason he says '(he) has\nacquired greater power.'\n\n1:9:1:1212\\. 'May he prosper in this sacrifice which goes to the gods!' he\nthereby says, 'May he be successful in this sacrifice which goes to the\ngods.'--'Thus prays this sacrificer, N.N. 1;' here he gives the name, and\nthereby makes him directly successful in his prayer.\n\n1:9:1:1313\\. 'He prays for long life,' what there (viz. at the invocation of\nthe i _d_ a) 2 was (called implicitly) 'future worship of the gods,' that is\nhere (called) expressly 'long life.'\n\np. 252\n\n1:9:1:1414\\. 'He prays for abundant offspring,'--what then was 'more abundant\noffering,' that is here expressly 'abundant offspring.' He who proceeds in\nthis way will ensure dominion. He may, however, say, 'He prays for future\nworship of the gods,' for thereby (he ensures) long life, offspring, cattle 1.\n\n1:9:1:1515\\. 'He prays for more abundant offering,' thereby (he prays for)\nthat same object. 'He prays for dominion over his co-evals (or countrymen);'--\nhis co-evals, doubtless, are his vital airs, for he is born along with his\nvital airs: hence he thereby prays for vital airs.\n\n1:9:1:1616\\. 'He prays for a heavenly abode;'--he who sacrifices assuredly\nsacrifices with the desire that there may be for him also (a place) in the\nworld of the gods: he thereby confers on him a share in the world of the gods\n2. 'May he obtain, may he accomplish what he prays for through this offering!'\nhe thereby says, 'May all, that he prays for through this offering, be\nfulfilled to him!'\n\n1:9:1:1717\\. These five prayers for blessings he offers now, and three (he\noffered) at the i _d_ a, these are eight. Of eight syllables, truly, consists\nthe gayatri metre, and the gayatri means vigour: hence he thereby imparts\nvigour to the prayers.\n\n1:9:1:1818\\. Let him not offer more than these; for if he offered more, he\nwould do what is in excess; and what is in excess at the sacrifice, that\nremains over\n\np. 253\n\nfor the benefit of his spiteful enemy: hence he should not offer more\n(prayers) than these.\n\n1:9:1:1919\\. Even less,--seven (he may offer) 1.--'May the gods vouchsafe him\nthat!' he thereby says, 'May the gods grant him that.'--'May the god Agni\nsolicit that from the gods, we men from Agni--,' he thereby says, 'May the god\nAgni solicit that from the gods, and we will then solicit it for this\n(sacrificer) from Agni--'\n\n1:9:1:2020\\. '--What was searched for and found 2;' they indeed searched for\nthe sacrifice, and found it: therefore he says, 'what was searched for and\nfound.'--And 'may both heaven and earth guard this one (enam) from anxiety!'\nhe thereby says, 'may both heaven and earth protect him from suffering.'\n\n1:9:1:2121\\. Here now some say, 'And may both heaven and earth guard me (ma 3)\n. . .,' arguing that in this way the Hot _ri_ does not exclude himself from\nthe benediction. Let him not, however, say this; for, surely, the benediction\nat the sacrifice is for the sacrificer: what then have the officiating priests\nto do with it? Whatever blessing the officiating priests invoke at the\nsacrifice, that is for the sacrificer only. On the other hand, whoever says,\n'and may both heaven and earth guard me . . .,' does not establish\n\np. 254\n\nthat blessing anywhere: let him therefore say, 'and may both heaven and earth\nguard this one. . . .'\n\n1:9:1:2222\\. 'Hither lies the course of any boon;' he thereby makes over to\nthis (sacrificer) whatever is excellent in the sacrifice: for this reason he\nsays, 'hither lies the course of any boon.'\n\n1:9:1:2323\\. 'And this adoration (shall be offered) to the gods!' having\nattained the completion of the sacrifice, he thereby renders adoration to the\ngods: for this reason he says, 'and this adoration to the gods!'\n\n1:9:1:2424\\. Thereupon he pronounces the 'All-hail and blessing' ( _s_ am-yos)\n1. Now it was _S_ amyu Barhaspatya who perceived, in its true nature, the\nconsummation of the sacrifice. He went to share in the world of the gods.\nThereupon that (knowledge) was entirely lost to men.\n\n1:9:1:2525\\. It then became known to the _Ri_ shis, that _S_ amyu Barhaspatya\nhad perceived, in its true nature, the consummation of the sacrifice, and had\ngone to share in the world of the gods. By pronouncing the _s_ amyo _h_ , they\nattained to that same consummation of the sacrifice which _S_ amyu Barhaspatya\nhad perceived; and to that same consummation of the sacrifice, which Samyu\nBarhaspatya had perceived, this (Hot _ri_ )\n\np. 255\n\nattains by pronouncing the _s_ am-yo _h_. For this reason he pronounces the\n'All-hail and blessing.'\n\n1:9:1:2626\\. He intones, 'We long for that All-hail and blessing ( _s_ am-yo\n_h_ );' whereby he says, 'We long for that consummation of the sacrifice which\n_S_ amyu Barhaspatya perceived.'\n\n1:9:1:2727\\. 'Success to the sacrifice, success to the lord of sacrifice!' he\nwho wishes for the consummation of the sacrifice, thereby wishes success to\nthe sacrifice and success to the lord of sacrifice.--'Bliss (svasti) to us,\nbliss to men!' he thereby says, 'May we enjoy bliss among the gods, bliss\namong men!'--'May the means of salvation ascend on high!' he thereby says,\n'May this sacrifice secure for us the world of the gods!'\n\n1:9:1:2828\\. 'All-hail, for us, to the two-footed, all-hail to the four-footed\n1!' for so far as the two-footed and the four-footed (extend), so far does\nthis universe (extend). Having now attained the consummation of the sacrifice,\nhe bids All-hail to this (sacrificer), and for this reason he says, 'All-hail,\nfor us, to the two-footed, all-hail to the four-footed!'\n\n1:9:1:2929\\. He then touches (the earth) thus with this (finger) 2. Non-human,\nverily, he becomes at the\n\np. 256\n\ntime when he is chosen for the office of sacrificial priest; and, this earth\nbeing a safe standing-place, he thereby (viz. by touching the earth) stands on\nthis safe standing-place; and he thereby also again becomes human: for this\nreason he thus touches (the earth) with this (finger).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[247:2](sbe1237.htm#fr_585) The author now proceeds to give in detail the\nformulas to be recited by the Hot _ri_ during the ceremonies treated in the\npreceding Brahma _n_ a (see [p. 236](sbe1235.htm#page_236), note\n[2](sbe1236.htm#fn_553)); pars. 1-23 treating of the suktavaka; pars. 24-29 of\nthe _s_ amyuvaka.\n\n[248:1](sbe1237.htm#fr_586) Suktaiva tad aha, which the commentator\nparaphrases by sukta\xe1\xb9\x85y aha. It is apparently intended as an explanation of the\nterm suktavaka. The word sukta here has exceptionally the accent on the\npenultimate.\n\n[248:2](sbe1237.htm#fr_587) See [p. 240](sbe1236.htm#page_240), note\n[2](sbe1236.htm#fn_561). The formulas are given Taitt. Br. III, 5, 10; \xc3\x82 _s_\nv. _S_. I, 9, 1.\n\n[249:1](sbe1237.htm#fr_588) 'Suktavakam uta namovakam.' Our author seems to\nrefer these terms to the _Ri_ k-verses and the Ya _g_ us-formulas used during\nthe sacrifice. Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. S. II, 6, 9, takes 'namovaka' in a more\nrestricted sense, viz. as referring to the formula 'namo devebhya _h_.' Both\nthe Black Ya _g_ ur-vela and \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. add ' _ri_ dhyasma sukto _k_ yam,'\nwhich has probably to be taken in the sense of 'May we accomplish that which\nis expressed in the suktas.' [Saya _n_ a, 'May we succeed with the sukta yet\nto be pronounced.']\n\n[249:2](sbe1237.htm#fr_589) For upa _s_ ruti the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda has upa\n_s_ rito, which Saya _n_ a explains, 'Since thou art established in heaven and\nearth, thou art able to recite the sukta.'\n\n[249:3](sbe1237.htm#fr_590) _S_ a _m_ gavi seems to be a corruption of _S_ a\n_m_ gayi (propitious to the household), which is the reading of the Black Ya\n_g_ ur-veda and \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. (cf. Rig-veda IX, 97, 17).\n\n[249:4](sbe1237.htm#fr_591) ? Apravede, according to Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. S.\nI, 1, 13, in an active sense, 'they who do not tell of, do not betray, our\nfaults' (hence 'verschwiegen,' reticent, discreet, St. Petersb. Dict.)\n'Difficult to obtain,' Harisvamin. Our author apparently takes it in the sense\nof 'not obtained before.'\n\n[251:1](sbe1237.htm#fr_592) \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. reads twice asau 'N.N., N.N.;' and\nthe commentary remarks that the Hot _ri_ has here to pronounce both the\nordinary name of the sacrificer, and his nakshatra name (i.e. the mystic name\ngiven him for the duration of the sacrifice, and derived from the respective\nlunar mansion, or its tutelary deity). This practice was probably not yet in\nvogue in the time of our author. Cf. Weber, Nakshatra II, p. 316 seq.\n\n[251:2](sbe1237.htm#fr_593) See I, 8, 1, 30 seq.\n\n[252:1](sbe1237.htm#fr_594) The ritual of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda (Taitt. Br.\nIII, 5, 10; Taitt. S. II, 6, 9, 7) and the \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. prescribe both these\nformulas. The order of formulas also, as there given, differs somewhat from\nthat of our work.\n\n[252:2](sbe1237.htm#fr_595) The Black Ya _g_ ur-veda and \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. insert\nhere, 'He prays for all that is dear to him.'\n\n[253:1](sbe1237.htm#fr_596) That is, if he chooses to omit the second formula\nmentioned in par. 14.\n\n[253:2](sbe1237.htm#fr_597) 'Ish _t_ a _m_ _k_ a vitta _m_ _k_ a.' This is\nalso the reading of the \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. (? 'What was wished for and obtained').\nThe Ka _n_ va text reads 'ish _t_ a _m_ _k_ a vitta _m_ _k_ abhut.' Our author\nseems here to refer to the legend in I, 5, 2, 6 seq., or to that in I, 6, 2, 1\nseq. The reading of the Black Ya _g_ us, ish _t_ a _m_ _k_ a vita _m_ _k_ a,\n'what has been offered up and accepted (eaten by the gods),' is probably the\noriginal and correct one.\n\n[253:3](sbe1237.htm#fr_598) The Ka _n_ va recension, the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda,\nand \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. read no, 'us.'\n\n[254:1](sbe1237.htm#fr_599) See [p. 247](sbe1236.htm#page_247), note 2. The\noriginal meaning of the terms _s_ am yos, as they occur in the Rig-veda, is\nhappily rendered by Professor Max Muller (Translation of the Rig-veda, I, p.\n182) by 'health and wealth.' In the sacrificial ceremonial a deeper\nsignificance bas come to be attached to this benedictory formula, for which it\nis difficult to find an exact equivalent. The entire _s_ amyuvaka, as here\ngiven, forms part of a khila to the last book of the _Ri_ k-Sa _m_ hita; cf.\nMax Muller's edition, vol. vi. p. 32; A. Weber, Ind. Stud. IV, p. 431. The\nBlack Ya _g_ us version of the legend regarding _S_ amyu Barhaspatya (Taitt.\nS. II, 6, 10) is quite different from ours; they were both invented to explain\n_s_ am yos.\n\n[255:1](sbe1237.htm#fr_600) This formula occurs almost identically in Rig-veda\nVI, 74, 1; VII, 54, 1; (IX, 69, 7.) Cf. Max Muller, Translation of the Rig-\nveda, I, p. 180, where attention is drawn to a somewhat similar phrase in the\nUmbric prayers of the Eugubian tables.\n\n[255:2](sbe1237.htm#fr_601) In Katy. III, 6, 21 the touching of the altar is\nprescribed, with the text Va _g_. S. II, 19 b; the commentators differ as to\nwhether the sacrificer or the Adhvaryu is to do this. The Ka _n_ va Sa _m_\nhita omits that formula, and hence assigns this touching to the Hot _ri_.\nHarisvamin remarks that the Hot _ri_ touches the earth with the little finger\nof his right hand, as stated in the Ka _n_ va recension. The latter reads\n'with the little finger.' No mention is made in the \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_. of this\ntouching of the earth on the part of the Hot _ri_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 9, 2.
