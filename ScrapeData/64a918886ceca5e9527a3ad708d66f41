This Sutra, which recommends self-\ncremation, is of some importance, as it confirms the teaching of the Pura _n_\nas and explains the accounts of the Greeks regarding the self-immolation of\nBrahma _n_ as who visited Europe.\n\n[136:9](sbe1432.htm#fr_716) Vish _n_ u XCII, 21.\n\n[136:12](sbe1432.htm#fr_717) Vish _n_ u XCII, 27; Manu IV, 232. \'Master of a\nharem,\' i.e. the possessor of many beautiful wives and concubines.\n\n[137:14](sbe1432.htm#fr_718) Vish _n_ u XCII, 31. 15.
