When the gods restored the relaxed Pra _g_ apati, they poured him,\nas seed, into the fire-pan (ukha) as the womb, for the fire-pan is a womb. In\nthe course of a year they prepared for him this food, to wit, the fire-altar\nbuilt here, and enclosed it in a body; and, being enclosed in a body, it\nbecame the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a body, becomes the body\nitself.\n\n10:4:1:22\\. In like manner does the Sacrificer now pour his own self (or\nbody), as seed, into the fire-pan as the womb, for the fire-pan is a womb. In\nthe course of a year he prepares for it (his self) this food, to wit, the\nfire-altar here built, and encloses it in a body, and, being enclosed in a\nbody, it becomes the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a body,\nbecomes the body itself.\n\n10:4:1:33\\. He places him (the Ukhya Agni, on the fire-altar) with 'Vausha _t_\n2!' for 'vauk' is he (Agni),\n\np. 342\n\nand 'sha _t_ (six)' is this six-layered food: having prepared it, he offers it\nto him as proportionate to this body, for food which is proportionate to the\nbody satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much, it does\ninjure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.\n\n10:4:1:44\\. Now that Arka 1 (flame) is this very fire which they bring here;\nand the Kya 1 is this his food, to wit, the fire-altar built here: that\n(combined) makes the Arkya 2 in respect of the Ya _g_ us. And the Great one\n(mahan) is this (Agni), and this vrata 3 (rite) is his food: that makes the\nMahavrata (saman) in respect of the Saman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha'\nhis food,--that (combined) makes the Uktha ( _s_ astra, recitation) 4 in\nrespect of the _Ri_ k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted\nthreefold.\n\n10:4:1:55\\. Now Indra and Agni were created as the Brahman (priesthood) and\nthe Kshatra (nobility): the Brahman was Agni and the Kshatra Indra. When\ncreated, the two were separate. They spake, 'Whilst being thus, we shall be\nunable to produce creatures (people): let us both become one form!' The two\nbecame one form.\n\n10:4:1:66\\. Now those two, Indra and Agni, are the same as these two, to wit,\nthe gold plate and the (gold) man 5: Indra is the gold plate, and Agni the\nman.\n\np. 343\n\n[paragraph continues] They are made of gold: gold means light, and Indra and\nAgni are the light; gold means immortal life, and Indra and Agni mean immortal\nlife.\n\n10:4:1:77\\. It is these two, Indra and Agni, that they build up. Whatever is\nof brick that is Agni: whence they bake that (part) by fire, and all that is\nbaked by fire is Agni. And what filling of earth there is (in the altar) that.\nis Indra: whence they do not bake that (part) by fire, lest it should be Agni,\nand not Indra. Thus it is these two, Indra and Agni, that are built up.\n\n10:4:1:88\\. And the two become that one form, to wit, the fire which is placed\non the built (altar), and hence those two, by means of that form, produce\ncreatures. Now Agni, indeed, is this single brick 1, and into this the whole\nAgni passes: this, indeed, is the perfection of bricks,--it is that one\nsyllable (akshara) 'vauk,' it is this into which the whole Agni passes, and\nwhich is the perfection of syllables.\n\n10:4:1:99\\. It is this that the _Ri_ shi saw when he said, 'I praise what hath\nbeen and what will be, the Great Brahman, the one Akshara,--the manifold\nBrahman, the one Akshara; for, indeed, all the gods, all beings pass into that\nAkshara (imperishable\n\np. 344\n\nelement 1): it is both the Brahman and the Kshatra; and the Brahman is Agni,\nand the Kshatra Indra; and the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ (all the gods) are Indra and\nAgni.' But the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ (the All-gods) are also the peasantry: hence\nit is Priesthood, Nobility, and Peasantry.\n\n10:4:1:1010\\. And, indeed, _S_ yapar _n_ a Sayakayana, knowing this, once\nsaid, 'If this my sacrificial performance were complete, my own race would\nbecome the kings (nobles), Brahma _n_ as, and peasants of the Salvas; but even\nby that much of my work which has been completed 2 my race will surpass the\nSalvas in both ways;'--for this (Agni, the fire-altar), indeed, is (social)\neminence and fame, and an eater of food 3.\n\np. 345\n\n10:4:1:1111\\. And regarding this, Sa _n_ _d_ ilya, having instructed\nVamakakshaya _n_ a 1, said, 'Thou wilt become eminent, famous, and an eater of\nfood (rich);' and, indeed, he who knows this becomes eminent, famous, and an\neater of food.\n\n10:4:1:1212\\. And this Agni is no other than Pra _g_ apati.\n\np. 346\n\n[paragraph continues] The gods, having restored this Agni-Pra _g_ apati, in\nthe course of a year prepared this food for him, to wit, this Mahavratiya cup\nof Soma.\n\n10:4:1:1313\\. The Adhvaryu draws it by means of a cup, and inasmuch as he\ndraws (grah) it, it is (called) a draught (graha, cup of Soma). The Udgat _ri_\n(chanter), by the Mahavrata (saman), puts flavour (vital sap) into it; and the\nMahavrata (saman) being (composed of) all those (five) samans, he thus puts\nflavour into it by means of all samans (hymn-tunes). The Hot _ri_ puts flavour\ninto it by means of the Great Recitation; and the Great Recitation being\n(composed of) all those _Ri_ k-verses: he thus puts flavour into it by all the\n_Ri_ k-verses.\n\n10:4:1:1414\\. And when they chant the hymn, and he (the Hot _ri_ ) afterwards\nrecites (the _s_ astra) 1, he (the Adhvaryu) offers that (cup of Soma) to him\n(Agni-Pra _g_ apati) as the Vasha _t_ -call is uttered. Now 'vauk' is this\n(Agni), and 'sha _t_ ' this sixfold food 2: having prepared it, he offers it\nto him as proportionate to his body; for food which is proportionate to the\nbody satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much, it does\ninjure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.\n\n10:4:1:1515\\. Now that Arka (flame) is this very fire-altar\n\np. 347\n\nbuilt here; and the Kya is this his food, to wit, the Mahavratiya-graha: that\n(combined) makes the Arkya in respect of the Ya _g_ us. And the Great one\n(mahan) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the\nMahavrata in respect of the Saman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his\nfood: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the _Ri_ k. Thus, whilst\nbeing only one, this is accounted threefold.\n\n10:4:1:1616\\. And this Agni is Pra _g_ apati, the year 1: the Savitra\n(oblations) are one half thereof, and the Vai _s_ va-karma _n_ a (oblations) 2\nthe (other) half; the Savitra are eight digits (kala 3) thereof, and the Vai\n_s_ vakarma _n_ a (the other) eight; and that which is performed between them\nis the seventeenfold Pra _g_ apati. Now what a digit is to men that a syllable\n(akshara) is to the gods.\n\n10:4:1:1717\\. And 'loma (hair)' is two syllables, 'tvak 4 (skin)' two, 'as\n_ri_ k (blood)' two, 'medas (fat)' two, 'ma _m_ sam (flesh)' two, 'snava\n(sinew)' two, 'asthi (bone)' two, 'ma _g_ _g_ a (marrow) 5' two,--that makes\nsixteen digits; and the vital air which circulates therein, is the\nseventeenfold Pra _g_ apati.\n\n10:4:1:1818\\. These sixteen digits convey the food to that vital air; and when\nthey take to conveying no food to it, then it consumes them and departs (from\nthe body): hence he who is hungry here, feels very\n\np. 348\n\nrestless, consumed as he is by his vital airs; and hence he who suffers from\nfever becomes very thin, for he is consumed by his vital airs.\n\n10:4:1:1919\\. Now for that seventeenfold Pra _g_ apati they prepared this\nseventeenfold food, the Soma-sacrifice: those sixteen digits of his are these\nsixteen officiating priests,--one should not, therefore, take a seventeenth\npriest 1 lest one should do what is excessive;--and what vital sap there is\nhere--the oblations that are offered--that is the seventeenfold food.\n\n10:4:1:2020\\. And when they chant the hymn, and when he (the Hot _ri_ )\nafterwards recites (the _s_ astra), he (the Adhvaryu) offers to him that food\nas the Vasha _t_ -call is uttered. Now 'vauk' is this (Agni), and 'sha _t_ '\nthis sixfold food: having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate to\nhis body; for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not\ninjure it; but when there is too much it does injure it, and when there is too\nlittle, it does not satisfy it.\n\n10:4:1:2121\\. Now that Arka (flame) is this very fire-altar built here; and\nthe Kya is this his food, to wit, the Soma-sacrifice: that (combined) makes\nthe Arkya in respect of the Ya _g_ us. And the Great one (mahan) is this\n(Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mahavrata in respect\nof the Saman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the\n(Mahad) Uktha in respect of the _Ri_ k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is\naccounted threefold. With this food he went upwards; and he who\n\np. 349\n\nwent upwards is yonder sun, and that food wherewith he went up is that moon.\n\n10:4:1:2222\\. He who shines yonder is indeed that Arka (flame), and that moon\nis his food, the Kya: that (combined) makes the Arkya in respect of the Ya _g_\nus. And the Great one (mahan) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his\nfood: that makes the Mahavrata in respect of the Saman. And 'uk' is this\n(Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the\n_Ri_ k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold. Thus much as\nto the deity.\n\n10:4:1:2323\\. Now as to the body. The Arka (flame), doubtless, is the breath\n(vital air), and the Kya is its food: that makes the Arkya in respect of the\nYa _g_ us. And the Great one (mahan) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is\nhis food: that makes the Mahavrata in respect of the Saman. And 'uk' is this\n(Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the\n_Ri_ k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold. And, indeed,\nthat (Agni) is that (sun) as to the deity, and this (breath) as to the body.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[341:2](sbe4361.htm#fr_670) See [IX, 2, 3, 35](sbe4334.htm#9:2:3:35), where it\nwas stated that the fire should be laid down with the Vasha _t_ -call ('vausha\n_t_!') uttered after the two verses, Va _g_. S. XVII, 72. 73. Here, as at I,\n7, 2, 21, the sacrificial call, 'vausha _t_ '--for 'vasha _t_ ,' apparently an\nirregular subjunctive aorist of 'vah': 'may he bear (the oblation to the\ngods)!'--is fancifully explained as composed of 'vauk' (i.e. vak, speech), and\n'sha _t_ ,' six.\n\n[342:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_672) See [X, 3, 4, 2](sbe4359.htm#10:3:4:2) seq.\n\n[342:2](sbe4361.htm#fr_673) That is, what relates to the Arka (the Fire, or\nAgni _k_ ayana).\n\n[342:3](sbe4361.htm#fr_674) That is, here, the Mahad uktham, or Great\nRecitation of the Mahavrata day.\n\n[342:4](sbe4361.htm#fr_675) Perhaps with the implied sense of 'fast-food,'\n'fast-milk,' the milk taken by the Sacrificer during the initiation as his\nonly food.\n\n[342:5](sbe4361.htm#fr_676) For the gold plate worn by the Sacrificer whilst\ncarrying about p. 343 the Ukhya Agni, and ultimately deposited on the lotus-\nleaf in the centre of the altar-site before the first layer is laid down, see\nVI, 7, I, 1 seq.; VII, 4, 1, 10 seq. For the gold man placed on the gold\nplate, VII, 4, 1, 15 seq. Whilst the gold man was indeed identified with Agni-\nPra _g_ apati, as well as with the Sacrificer, the gold plate was taken\nthroughout as representing the sun.\n\n[343:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_677) According to Saya _n_ a, this one brick is the\nsyllable ('akshara,' which also means 'the imperishable, indestructible')\n'vauk' contained in the 'Vausha _t_ ,' uttered when the sacred fire is placed\non the newly-built altar.\n\n[344:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_678) Aksharam avina _s_ vara _m_ sarvagata _m_ va\nbrahma sa _k_ _k_ idanandaikarasam. Saya _n_ a.\n\n[344:2](sbe4361.htm#fr_679) Or, perhaps--but since so much of my work has been\ncompleted, my race will thereby surpass the Salvas. Cf. Delbruck, Altind.\nSyntax, p. 266.\n\n[344:3](sbe4361.htm#fr_680) Saya _n_ a takes this as intended to explain the\n'in both' ways' of the quotation, viz. in regard to ' _s_ ri' (social\ndistinction) on the one hand, and to 'ya _s_ as' (fame) and food (material\nprosperity) on the other. There is, however, nothing in the text to favour any\nsuch grouping of the distinctive objects of aspiration associated with the\nthree classes (var _n_ atrayatmakatvam upa _g_ ivya karma _n_ a _h_ , _s_ riya\n_s_ o\xe0\xa4\xbdnnadalaksha _n_ a _m_ phalam. Saya _n_ a), or with men generally (cf.\nAitareyar. I, 4, 2, 10). Perhaps it means both in an intellectual and material\npoint of view. The Syapar _n_ as seem to have been a rather self-assertive\nfamily of priests. The Aitareya Brahma _n_ a tells the following story about\nthem (VII, 27):--Vi _s_ vantara Saushadmana, setting aside the _S_ yapar _n_\nas, got up a sacrifice without them. The Syapar _n_ as, becoming aware of\nthis, came to the sacrifice and sat them down inside the sacrificial ground.\nOn seeing them, Vi _s_ vantara said, 'There sit those doers of evil deeds,\nthose speakers of foul language, the Syapar _n_ as: turn them out let them not\nsit inside my sacrificial ground!'--'So be it!' they said, and p. 345 turned\nthem out. In being turned out, they cried aloud, 'At a sacrifice of _G_ aname\n_g_ aya, son of Parikshit, performed without the Ka _s_ yapas, the Asitam _ri_\ngas from amongst the Ka _s_ yapas won the Soma-drink from the Bhutaviras (who\nwere officiating). In them they had heroic men on their side: what hero is\nthere amongst us who will win that Soma-drink?'--'Here is that hero of yours,'\nsaid Rama Margaveya. Rama Margaveya was a _S_ yapar _n_ iya, learned in sacred\nlore. When they rose to leave, he said, 'O king, will they turn out of the\nsacrificial ground even one so learned as me?'--'Whoever thou art, what\nknowest thou, vile Brahman?'--'When the gods turned Indra away because he had\noutraged Tvash _t_ _ri_ 's son Vi _s_ varupa, and laid low V _ri_ tra, and\nthrown devotees before the jackals, and slain the Arurmaghas, and retorted on\nB _ri_ haspati (the teacher of the gods)--then Indra was deprived of the Soma-\ncup; and along with him the Kshatriyas were deprived of the Soma-cup. By\nstealing the Soma from Tvash _t_ _ri_ , Indra obtained a share in the Soma-\ncup, but to this day the Kshatriyas are deprived of the Soma-cup: how can they\nturn out from the sacrificial ground one who knows how the Kshatriya race can\nbe put in possession of the Soma-cup from which they are deprived?'--'Knowest\nthou (how to procure) that drink, O Brahman?'--'I know it indeed.'--'Tell us\nthen, O Brahman?'--'To thee, O king, I will tell it,' he said. Ultimately the\n_S_ yapar _n_ as are reinstated in their sacrificial duties. Cf. R. Roth, Zur\nLitteratur and Geschichte des Weda, p. 118. At VI, 2, I, 39, Syapar _n_ a\nSayakayana was stated to have been the last who was in the habit of immolating\nfive victims instead of two, as became afterwards the custom.\n\n[345:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_681) In the succession of teachers of the doctrine of\nthe fire-altar, given at the end of the present Ka _n_ _d_ a, Vamakakshaya _n_\na is said to have received his instruction from Vatsya, and the latter from\n_S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya, who, in his turn, received it from Ku _s_ ri. Cf. Weber,\nInd. Stud. I, p. 259.\n\n[346:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_682) Viz. the Mahad uktham (see [p.\n110](sbe4324.htm#page_110), note [3](sbe4324.htm#fn_202)), preceded by the\nchanting of the Mahavrata-saman (see [p. 362](sbe4364.htm#page_362), note\n[5](sbe4364.htm#fn_706)) (p. 382 originally--JBH).\n\n[346:2](sbe4361.htm#fr_683) That is, according as it is flavoured by the six\ndifferent 'rasas' (flavours or tastes)--sweet (madhura), sour (amla), salt\n(lava _n_ a), pungent (ka _t_ uka), bitter (tikta), and astringent (kashaya).\nThus according to Saya _n_ a; but see also [paragraph\n3](sbe4361.htm#10:4:1:3), where the sixfold nature of the food is identified\nwith the six-layered altar. Perhaps both explanations are intended to apply.\n\n[347:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_684) Or, perhaps, this Pra _g_ apati-Agni is the year.\n\n[347:2](sbe4361.htm#fr_685) For these two sets of formulas and oblations, see\n[IX, 5, 1, 43](sbe4343.htm#9:5:1:43) and note.\n\n[347:3](sbe4361.htm#fr_686) A 'kala' is the sixteenth part of the moon's\ndiameter, and then a sixteenth part generally.\n\n[347:4](sbe4361.htm#fr_687) Pronounce 'tu-ak.'\n\n[347:5](sbe4361.htm#fr_688) For five of these parts of the body, see [X, 1, 3,\n4](sbe4347.htm#10:1:3:4).\n\n[348:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_689) This prohibition is probably directed against the\nKaushitakins, who recognise a seventeenth officiating priest, the Sadasya, who\nseems to have taken no other part in the sacrificial performance except\nsitting in the Sadas as the permanent custodian thereof.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 4, 2.
