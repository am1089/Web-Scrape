(The passage, Ka _th_ aka I, 3, 10, gives information about the person)\nfor the purpose of pious meditation, as there is no use (of the knowledge of\nthe objects being higher than the senses and so on).\n\nWe read in the Ka _th_ aka (I, 3, 10), 'Higher than the senses are the\nobjects, higher than the objects there is the mind, &c. &c.; higher than the\nperson there is nothing--this is the goal, the highest road.'--Here the doubt\narises whether the purport of the passage is to intimate that each of the\nthings successively enumerated is higher than the preceding one, or only that\nthe person is higher than all of them.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains the former alternative, for the reason that the\ntext expressly declares the objects to be higher than the senses, the mind\nhigher than the objects and so on.\n\nThe objection that the assumption of the passage intending to represent many\nthings as successively superior to their antecedents would involve a so-called\nsplit of the sentence, he meets by the remark that the passage may be viewed\nas containing a plurality of sentences. Many sentences may represent many\nthings as superior to their antecedents, and hence each clause of the passage\nmust be viewed as containing a separate statement of the superiority of\nsomething to other things.\n\nTo this we reply as follows.\n\nWe must assume that the whole passage aims at intimating only that the person\nis higher than everything. Any information as to the relative superiority of\nthe preceding members of the series would be devoid of all purpose; for of the\nknowledge derived from such observation a use is neither to be seen nor\ndeclared by scripture. Of the knowledge, on the other hand, of the person\nbeing higher than the senses and everything else, raised above all evil, we do\nsee a purpose, viz. the accomplishment of final release. And so scripture also\nsays, 'He who has perceived that is freed\n\np. 205\n\nfrom the jaws of death' (I, 3, 15). Moreover, the text by declaring that\nnothing is higher than the person and that he is the highest goal intimates\nreverence for the person, and thereby shows that the whole series of objects\nis enumerated only to the end of giving information about the person.--'For\nthe purpose of pious meditation,' i.e. for the purpose of perfect knowledge\nwhich has pious meditation for its antecedent. For the passage under\nconsideration does not teach pious meditation by itself.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 15](sbe38158.htm)\n\n"
