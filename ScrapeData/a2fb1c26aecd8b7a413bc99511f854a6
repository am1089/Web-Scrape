(Of them) there is non-return, according to scripture; non-return,\naccording to scripture.\n\nThose who, in following the road of the gods, to which the vein and the ray\nare leading, and on which light is the first stage, reach the world of Brahman\nas described by scripture--where 'there are the two lakes Ara and _N_ ya in\nthe world of Brahman, in the third heaven from hence,' and where 'there is the\nlake Airammadiya and the A _s_ vattha tree showering down Soma. and the city\nof Brahman Apara _g_ ita and the golden hall built by Prabhu' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 5, 3)--and set forth at length in mantras,\n\np. 419\n\narthavadas, and so on; those, we say, who reach that world do not return from\nthere after having finished the enjoyment of their deeds; as those do who have\ngone to the world of the moon and other places.---Why so?--Because scriptural\npassages teach that they do not so return. Compare 'Moving upwards by it he\nreaches the immortal' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 6); 'For them there is no return'\n(B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 15); 'Those who proceed on that path do not return to the\nlife of man' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 15, 6); 'He reaches the world of Brahman and does\nnot return' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 15, 1). That the finality of their lordly power\ndoes not imply their return to the life of man, we have shown under IV, 3, 10.\nIt is a settled matter that those who through perfect knowledge have dispelled\nall mental darkness and are devoted to the eternally perfect Nirva _n_ a do\nnot return. And as those also who rely on the knowledge of the qualified\nBrahman in the end have recourse to that (Nirva _n_ a), it follows that they\nalso do not return.--The repetition of the words, 'Non-return, according to\nscripture,' indicates the conclusion of this body of doctrine.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[418:1](sbe38337.htm#fr_237) All the commentators explain the reading\n'miyante.'--\xc3\x82n.
