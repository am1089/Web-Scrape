If it be said that (Brahman is) not (denoted) on account of the speaker\ndenoting himself; (we say, not so), because the multitude of connexions with\nthe inner Self (is possible only) in that (speaker if viewed as Brahman).\n\nAn objection is raised.--That the being introduced as Indra and Pra _n_ a\nshould be the highest Brahman, for the reason that it is identical with him\nwho, later on, is called 'blessed,' 'non-ageing, 'immortal'--this we cannot\nadmit. 'Know me only, I am pra _n_ a, meditate on me as the intelligent Self,\nas life, as immortality'--the speaker of these words is Indra, and this Indra\nenjoins on Pratardana meditation on his own person only, the individual\ncharacter of which is brought out by reference to certain deeds of strength\nsuch as the slaying of the son of Tvash _tri_ ('I slew the three-headed son of\nTvash _tri_ ,' &c.). As thus the initial part of the section clearly refers to\nan individual being, the terms occurring in the concluding part ('blessed,'\n'non-ageing,' 'immortal') must be interpreted so as to make them agree with\nwhat precedes.--This objection the Sutra disposes of. 'For the multitude of\nconnexions with the Self'--i.e. the multitude of things connected with the\nSelf as its attributes--is possible only 'in that,' i.e. in that speaker\nviewed as the highest Brahman. 'For, as in a car, the circumference of the\nwheel is placed on the spokes, and the spokes on the nave, thus are these\nobjects placed on the subjects, and the subjects on the prana. That pra _n_ a\nindeed is the intelligent Self, blessed, non-ageing, immortal.' The 'objects'\n(bhutamatra _h_ ) here are the aggregate of non-sentient things; the\n'subjects' (pra _g \xc3\xb1_amatra _h_ ) are the sentient beings in which the objects\nare said to abide; when thereupon the texts says that of these subjects the\nbeing called Indra and Pra _n_ a is the abode, and that he is blessed, non-\nageing, immortal; this qualification of being the abode of this Universe, with\nall its non-sentient and sentient beings, can belong to the highest Self only,\nwhich is other than all individual souls.\n\np. 252\n\nThe Sutra may also be explained in a somewhat different way, viz. 'there is a\nmultitude of connexions belonging to the highest Self, i.e. of attributes\nspecial to the highest Self, in that, viz. section.' The text at first says,\n'Choose thou that boon for me which thou deemest most beneficial to man '--to\nwhich the reply is, 'Meditate on me.' Here Indra-pra _n_ a is represented as\nthe object of a meditation which is to bring about Release; the object of such\nmeditation can be none but the highest Self.--'He makes him whom he wishes to\nlead up from these worlds do a good deed; and him whom he wishes to lead down\nfrom these worlds he makes do a bad deed.' The causality with regard to all\nactions which is here described is again a special attribute of the highest\nSelf.--The same has to be said with regard to the attribute of being the abode\nof all, in the passage about the wheel and spokes, quoted above; and with\nregard to the attributes of bliss, absence of old age and immortality,\nreferred to in another passage quoted before. Also the attributes of being\n'the ruler of the worlds, the lord of all,' can belong to the highest Self\nonly.--The conclusion therefore is that the being called Indra and Pra _n_ a\nis none other but the highest Self.--But how then can Indra, who is known to\nbe an individual person only, enjoin meditation on himself?--To this question\nthe next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 31.
