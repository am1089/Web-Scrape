And (the highest divinity is) endowed with all (powers) because that is\nseen (from Scripture).\n\nWe have stated that this multiform world of effects is possible to Brahman,\nbecause, although one only, it is endowed with various powers.--How then--it\nmay be asked--do you know that the highest Brahman is endowed with various\npowers?-He is, we reply, endowed with all powers, 'because that is seen.' For\nvarious scriptural passages declare that the highest divinity possesses all\npowers, 'He to whom all actions, all desires, all odours, all tastes belong,\nhe who embraces all this, who never speaks, and is\n\np. 355\n\nnever surprised' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 4); 'He who desires what is true and\nimagines what is true' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 1); 'He who knows all (in its\ntotality), and cognizes all (in its detail') (Mu. Up. I,1,9); 'By the command\nof that Imperishable, O Gargi, sun and moon stand apart' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8,\n9); and other similar passages.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 31](sbe34170.htm)\n\n"
