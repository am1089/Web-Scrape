There was formerly Gargya Balaki 2, famous as a man of great reading; for\nit was said of him that he lived among the U _s_ inaras, among the Satvat-\nMatsyas, the Kuru-Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ alas, the Ka _s_ i-Videhas 3. Having gone to A _g_\nata _s_ atru, (the king) of Ka _s_ i, he said to him: \'Shall I tell you\nBrahman?\' A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'We give a thousand (cows) for that\nspeech (of yours), for verily all people run away, saying, " _G_ anaka (the\nking of Mithila) is our father (patron)."\'\n\n2. 4 BRIHAD-\xc3\x82RA _N_ YAKA-UPANISHAD.\n\n|\n\nKAUSH\xc3\x8eTAKI-BR\xc3\x82HMANA-UPANISHAD.  \n  \n---|---  \n  \ni. \xc3\x82ditye purusha _h_.  \natish _th_ a _h_ sarvesham bhutanam murdha raga.\n\n|\n\ni.

Balaki said: \'The person that is in the sun, on him I meditate (as\nBrahman).\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'No, no! do not challenge me (to a\ndisputation) on this 1. I meditate on him who is called great, clad in white\nraiment 2, the supreme, the head of all beings. Whoso meditates\n\np. 303\n\non him thus, becomes supreme, and the head of all beings.\'\n\n4\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is in the moon, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as Soma, the king, the self, (source) of all food. Whoso meditates on him\nthus, becomes the self, (source) of all food.\'\n\n5\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is in the lightning, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as the self in light. Whoso meditates on him thus, becomes the self in\nlight.\'\n\n6\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is in the thunder, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as the self of sound 1. Whoso meditates on him thus, becomes the self of\nsound.\'\n\n7\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is in the ether, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as the full, quiescent Brahman. Whoso meditates on him thus, is filled\nwith offspring and cattle. Neither he himself nor his offspring dies before\nthe time.\'\n\n8\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is in the air, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as Indra Vaiku _n_ _th_ a, as the unconquerable army. Whoso meditates on\nhim thus, becomes victorious, unconquerable, conquering his enemies.\'\n\np. 304\n\n9\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is in the fire, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as powerful. Whoso meditates on him thus, becomes powerful among others\n1.\'\n\n10\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is in the water, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as the self of the name. Whoso meditates on him thus, becomes the self of\nthe name.\' So far with regard to deities (mythological); now with regard to\nthe body (physiological).\n\n11\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is in the mirror, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as the likeness. Whoso meditates on him thus, to him a son is born in his\nfamily who is his likeness, not one who is not his likeness.\'\n\n12\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is in the echo, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as the second, who never goes away. Whoso meditates on him thus, he gets a\nsecond from his second (his wife), he becomes doubled 2.\n\nBalaki said: \'The sound that follows a man, on that I meditate.\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on\n\np. 305\n\nthis. I meditate on him as life. Whoso meditates on him thus, neither he\nhimself nor his offspring will faint before the time.\'\n\n14\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is in the shadow, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as death. Whoso meditates on him thus, neither he himself nor his\noffspring will die before the time.\'\n\n15\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is embodied, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as Lord of creatures. Whose, meditates on him thus, is multiplied in\noffspring and cattle.\'\n\n16\\. Balaki said: \'The Self which is conscious (pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a), and by whom he\nwho sleeps here, walks about in sleep, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as Yama the king. Whoso meditates on him thus, everything is subdued for\nhis excellencies.\'\n\n17\\. Balaki said: \'The person that is in the right eye, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as the self of the name, as the self of fire, as the self of splendour.\nWhoso meditates on him thus, he becomes the self of these.\'\n\n18\\. Balaki said The person that is in the left eye, on him I meditate.\'\n\nA _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on\nhim as the self of the true, as the self of lightning, as the self of light.\nWhoso\n\np. 306\n\nmeditates on him thus, he becomes the self of these.\'\n\n19\\. After this Balaki became silent. A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Thus\nfar only (do you know), O Balaki?\' \'Thus far only,\' replied Balaki.\n\nThen A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Vainly did you challenge me, saying:\n\'Shall I tell you Brahman? O Balaki, he who is the maker of those persons\n(whom you mentioned), he of whom all this is the work, he alone is to be\nknown.\'\n\nThereupon Balaki came, carrying fuel in his hand, saying: \'May I come to you\nas a pupil?\' A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'I deem it improper that a\nKshatriya should initiate a Brahma _n_ a. Come, I shall make you know\nclearly.\' Then taking him by the hand, he went forth. And the two together\ncame to a person who was asleep. And A _g_ ata _s_ atru called him, saying:\n\'Thou great one, clad in white raiment, Soma, King 1.\' But he remained lying.\nThen he pushed him with a stick, and he rose at once. Then said A _g_ ata _s_\natru to him: \'Balaki, where did this person here sleep? Where was he? Whence\ncame he thus back?\' Balaki did not know.\n\n20\\. And A _g_ ata _s_ atru said to him: \'Where this person here slept, where\nhe was, whence he thus came back, is this: The arteries of the heart called\nHita extend from the heart of the person towards the surrounding body. Small\nas a hair divided a thousand times, they stand full of a thin fluid of various\ncolours, white, black, yellow, red. In these the person is when sleeping he\nsees no dream.\n\np. 307\n\nThen he becomes one with that pra _n_ a alone. Then speech goes to him with\nall names, the eye with all forms, the car with all sounds, the mind with all\nthoughts. And when he awakes, then, as from a burning fire, sparks proceed in\nall directions, thus from that self the pra _n_ as (speech, &c.) proceed, each\ntowards its place, from the pra _n_ as the gods, from the gods the worlds. And\nas a razor might be fitted in a razor-case, or as fire in the fire-place (the\nara _n_ i on the altar), even thus this conscious self enters the self of the\nbody (considers the body as himself) to the very hairs and nails. And the\nother selfs (such as speech, &c.) follow that self, as his people follow the\nmaster of the house. And as the master feeds with his people, nay, as his\npeople feed on the master, thus does this conscious self feed with the other\nselfs, as a master with his people, and the other selfs follow him, as his\npeople follow the master. So long as Indra did not understand that self, the\nAsuras conquered him. When he understood it, he conquered the Asuras and\nobtained the pre-eminence among all gods, sovereignty, supremacy. And thus\nalso he who knows this obtains pre-eminence among all beings, sovereignty,\nsupremacy,--yea, he who knows this.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[300:1](sbe01242.htm#fr_755) Pra _n_ a, breath or life, has been explained in\nthe preceding chapter. But this pra _n_ a is not yet the highest point that\nhas to be reached. Pra _n_ a, life, even as united with pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a,\nconsciousness, is only a covering of something else, viz. the Self, and this\nHighest Self has now to be explained.\n\n[300:2](sbe01242.htm#fr_756) The same story is told in the B _ri_ had-ara _n_\nyaka II, 1 seq., but with important variations.\n\n[300:3](sbe01242.htm#fr_757) I take iti to depend on sa _m_ spash _t_ a, and\nread satvanmatsyeshu, though the commentary seems to have read so \'vasan, or\nsa vasan, for savasan. See Introduction, p. lxxvii.\n\n[300:4](sbe01242.htm#fr_758) The second paragraph forms a kind of table of\ncontents for the discussion which is to follow. I have given instead a fuller\ntable of contents, taken from the Brihad-ara _n_ yaka II, as compared with the\nKaushitaki-upanishad in its two texts. The variations of text A are given in\nsmall letters. In text B, the table of contents is given at the end of the\ndiscussion, in \xc2\xa7 18.\n\n[302:1](sbe01242.htm#fr_759) The king means to say that he knows this already,\nand that he can mention not only the predicates of the person in the sun thus\nmeditated on as Brahman, but also the rewards of such meditation.\n\n[302:2](sbe01242.htm#fr_760) This is properly a predicate of the moon, and\nused as such in the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka-upanishad, in the second paragraph\nof the dialogue.\n\n[303:1](sbe01242.htm#fr_761) This is not mentioned in the B _ri_ had-ara _n_\nyaka.\n\n[304:1](sbe01242.htm#fr_762) Instead of anyeshu, the second text, as printed\nby Professor Cowell, has anv esha.\n\n[304:2](sbe01242.htm#fr_763) This paragraph does not occur in the B _ri_ had-\nara _n_ yaka.\n\n[306:1](sbe01242.htm#fr_764) See \xc2\xa7 3 init.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: \xc3\x8e _s_ a-Upanishad](sbe01243.htm)\n\n'
