Finiteness or absence of omniscience.\n\n'Or' here has the sense of 'and.' If the Lord is under the influence of the ad\n_ri_ sh _t_ a, it follows that, like the individual soul, he is subject to\ncreation, dissolution, and so on, and that he is not omniscient. The Pa _s_\nupati theory cannot therefore be accepted.--It is true that the Sutra, 'but in\ncase of conflict (with Scripture) it is not to be regarded' (Pu. Mi. Su. I, 3,\n3), has already established the non-acceptability of all views contrary to the\nVeda; the present adhikara _n_ a, however, raises this question again in order\nspecially to declare that the Pa _s_ upati theory _is_ contrary to the Veda.\nAlthough the Pa _s_ upata and the _S_ aiva systems exhibit some features which\nare not altogether contrary to the Veda, yet they are unacceptable because\nthey rest on an assumption contrary to the Veda, viz. of the difference of the\ngeneral, instrumental and material causes, and imply an erroneous interchange\nof higher and lower entities.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'Pa _s_\nupati.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 40.
