Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t is the second (deity).\n\n8\\. (At the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t oblation) the 'spreading under' and taking an\nAvadana are done once, the sprinkling over (of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya) twice.\n\n9\\.

In the same way, with the exception of the sacrificial gift, they should\nsacrifice a Sthalipaka from then onwards, on the days of the new and full\nmoon, after having fasted.\n\n18\\. Some say that a vessel full (of grain) is the sacrificial gift.\n\n19. 19 From then onwards he should offer morning and evening with his hand these two oblations (to Agni and to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t) of (rice) grains or of barley.\n\np. 266\n\n20\\.
