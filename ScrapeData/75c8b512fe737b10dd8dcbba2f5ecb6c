'Understanding (vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana) is better than reflection. Through\nunderstanding we understand the Rig-veda, the Ya _g_ ur-veda, the Sama-veda,\nand as the fourth the \xc3\x82tharvana, as the fifth the Itihasa-pura _n_ a 1, the\nVeda of the Vedas, the Pitrya, the Ra _s_ i, the Daiva, the Nidhi, the\nVakovakya, the Ekayana, the Deva-vidya, the Brahma-vidya, the Bhuta-vidya, the\nKshatra-vidya, the Nakshatra-vidya, the Sarpa and Deva _g_ ana-vidya, heaven,\nearth, air, ether, water, fire, gods, men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees, all\nbeasts down to worms, midges, and ants; what is right and what is wrong; what\nis true and what is false; what is good and what is bad; what is pleasing and\nwhat is not pleasing; food and savour, this world and that, all this we\nunderstand through understanding. Meditate on understanding.\n\n2\\. 'He who meditates on understanding as Brahman, reaches the worlds where\nthere is understanding\n\np. 116\n\nand knowledge 1; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as understanding\nreaches--he who meditates on understanding as Brahman.'\n\n'Sir, is there something better than understanding?'\n\n'Yes, there is something better than understanding.'\n\n'Sir, tell it me.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[115:1](sbe01141.htm#fr_310) See before, p. 109.\n\n[116:1](sbe01141.htm#fr_311) The commentator takes vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ana here as\nunderstanding of sacred books, _g_ \xc3\xb1ana as cleverness with regard to other\nsubjects.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 8](sbe01142.htm)\n\n"
