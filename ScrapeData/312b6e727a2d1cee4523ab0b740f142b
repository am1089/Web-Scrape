And because owing to the acknowledgment of samavaya, there results a\n_regressus in infinitum_ from equality.\n\nThe Vai _s_ eshika doctrine is further untenable on account of the\nacknowledgment of samavaya.--Why so?--Because the samavaya also, like part,\nquality, and generic characteristics, requires something else to establish it,\nand that something else again requires some further thing to establish it--\nfrom which there arises an infinite regress. To explain. The Vai _s_ eshikas\nassume the so-called samavaya relation, defining it as \'that connexion which\nis the cause of the idea "this is here," in the case of things permanently and\ninseparably connected, and standing to each other in the relation of abode and\nthing abiding in the abode.\' Now, if such a samavaya relation is assumed in\norder to account for the fact that things observed to be inseparably connected\n--as, e.g., class characteristics are inseparably connected with the\nindividuals to which they belong--are such, i.e. inseparably connected, a\nreason has also to be searched for why the samavaya, which is of the same\nnature as those things (in so far, namely, as it is also inseparably connected\nwith the things connected by it), is such; and for that reason, again, a\nfurther reason has to be postulated, and so on, _in infinitum_. Nor can it be\nsaid that inseparable connexion must be assumed to constitute the essential\nnature of samavaya (so that no further reason need be demanded for its\ninseparable connexion); for on this reasoning you would have to assume the\nsame essential nature for class characteristics, qualities, and so on (which\nwould render the assumption of a samavaya needless for them also). Nor is it a\nlegitimate proceeding to postulate an unseen entity such as the samavaya is,\nand then to assume for it such and such an essential nature.--These objections\napply to the samavaya whether it be viewed as eternal or non-eternal. The next\nSutra urges a further objection against it if viewed as eternal.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13. And because the world also would thus be eternal](sbe48218.htm)\n\n'
