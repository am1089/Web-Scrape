That mind in breath, owing to the subsequent clause.\n\nThat mind, i.e. mind united with all the organs unites itself with breath; not\nmerely the function of mind. This appears from the clause following upon the\ntext quoted above, 'mind (unites itself) with breath.' Here, however, a\nfurther doubt suggests itself. The text 'Mind is made of earth' declares earth\nto be the causal substance of mind, and the text 'that (viz. water) sent forth\nearth' declares water to be the causal substance of earth; while the further\ntext 'breath is made of water' shows water to be the causal substance of\nbreath. Considering therefore that in the text 'mind becomes united with\nbreath' the term _breath_ is naturally understood to denote the causal\nsubstance of breath, i.e. water, the appropriate sense to be given to the\nstatement that mind is united with water is that mind is completely refunded\ninto its own causal substance--so that the 'being united' would throughout be\nunderstood 'as being completely merged.'--The reply to this, however, is, that\nthe clauses 'Mind is made of food, breath is made of water,' only mean that\nmind and breath are nourished and sustained by food and water, not that food\nand water are the causal substances of mind and breath. The latter indeed is\nimpossible; for mind consists of aha _m_ kara, and as breath is a modification\nof ether and other elements, the word _breath_ may suggest water.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'mind.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
