He lays down _Kh_ andasyas 2 (bricks pertaining to the metres).\nCompleted now was the entire\n\np. 110\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni (fire-altar). He now wished for distinction 1; for,\nindeed, heretofore he was not equal thereto, that he should sustain\ndistinction; whence people here say even to this day, 'This one is not equal\nto sustain distinction, either in regard to kingship or to headmanship.' The\ngods bestowed on him this distinction, these _Kh_ andasyas; for the metres (\n_Kh_ andas) are cattle, and cattle are food, and (a position of) distinction\nis food.\n\n8:6:2:22\\. He lays down triplets, for the beast is threefold--father, mother,\nson; and, embryo, amnion, chorion; and food also is threefold--ploughing,\nrain, seed. One of them is an Ati _kh_ andas 2 (excessive metre); for even\nwhilst being one, that one is beyond all the metres. And as to that\ndistinction, it is this great hymn of praise 3; and as to this great hymn of\npraise, it is these _Kh_ andasyas.\n\np. 111\n\n8:6:2:33\\. Gayatri verses are the head thereof, Trish _t_ ubh verses the body,\n_G_ agati verses the spine, and Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti verses the wings; and of each of those\nKakubh verses he takes four syllables 1, and adds them to\n\np. 112\n\nthe Ati _kh_ andas: that is just (what makes) that Ati _kh_ andas (excessive\nmetre). The others result in Gayatris: this is just that fourscore of Gayatris\n1, the B _ri_ hatis (make up) the Barhata one, and the Ush _n_ ihs the Aush\n_n_ iha one. And as to the Va _s_ a hymn 2, the two half-verses, the Aindragna\n(hymn), and the insertion, they are Atik _h_ andas; and as to\n\np. 113\n\nthe Nada-verse 1, the Sudadohas, the pada-appendages, and whatever Anush _t_\nubh matter there is, they make up the Anush _t_ ubhs.\n\n8:6:2:44\\. Dvipada verses are the feet. Thus much is the great hymn of praise,\nand the great hymn of praise means distinction: the gods bestowed upon him\n(Agni) all that distinction, and so does this (Sacrificer) bestow upon him all\nthat distinction.\n\n8:6:2:55\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the _Kh_ andasyas. The gods at\nthat time saw that firmament, the world of heaven, to wit, those Stomabhagas,\nand entered it. Of those entering, Pra _g_ apati entered\n\np. 114\n\nlast; and thus Pra _g_ apati is the same as these _Kh_ andasyas.\n\n8:6:2:66\\. Gayatris are his head; and as to its being Gayatris, it is because\nthe head is of Gayatri nature 1. There are three, for the head is threefold.\nHe places them on the forepart (of the altar), for the head (of the animal or\nbird) is in front.\n\n8:6:2:77\\. Trish _t_ ubhs are the chest: he places them on the range of the\ntwo Reta _h_ si _k_ ; for the Reta _h_ si _k_ are the ribs, and the ribs lie\nagainst the chest.\n\n8:6:2:88\\. _G_ agatis are the hips; at whatever distance from the naturally-\nperforated (central) brick he places the Trish _t_ ubhs in front, at the same\ndistance from it he places the _G_ agatis behind; for that naturally-\nperforated brick is this vital air in the middle (of the body), and as far\nfrom that vital air as the chest is in front, so far are the hips behind.\n\n8:6:2:99\\. Anush _t_ ubhs are the thighs: he places them close to the _G_\nagatis, and thereby places the thighs close to the hips.\n\n8:6:2:1010\\. B _ri_ hatis are the ribs, Kakubhs the breast-bone. The B _ri_\nhatis he places between the Trish _t_ ubhs and Kakubhs, whence these ribs are\nfastened on both sides, on the breast-bone and the costal cartilages 2.\n\n8:6:2:1111\\. Ush _n_ ihs are the neck: he places them close to the Gayatris,\nand thereby places the neck close to the head.\n\n8:6:2:1212\\. Pa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis are the wings: and as to their being\n\np. 115\n\n[paragraph continues] Pa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis, it is because the wings are of Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti\n(fivefold) nature. He places them sideways, for these wings are sideways.\nWhatever metre is larger that he places on the right side: he thus makes the\nright half of the animal the stronger, and hence the right side of an animal\nis the stronger.\n\n8:6:2:1313\\. An Ati _kh_ andas is the belly; for the metres are cattle, and\ncattle are food, and food is (what fills) the belly, because it is the belly\nthat eats the food: hence when the belly gets the food, it becomes eaten and\nused up. And inasmuch as this (brick) eats (atti) the metres ( _kh_ andas),\nthe cattle, it is called Atti _kh_ andas, for Atti _kh_ andas is really what\nis mystically called Ati _kh_ andas; for the gods love the mystic.\n\n8:6:2:1414\\. A (brick) covered with loose soil is the womb. These two he lays\nclose to each other, for the belly and the womb are close to each other. They\nare connected with loose soil, for loose soil means flesh, and both the belly\nand the womb are connected with flesh. The former is an Ati _kh_ andas, the\nlatter a soil-bedded one (purishavati), for the belly is higher, and the womb\nlower.\n\n8:6:2:1515\\. He places them so as to extend eastwards, for in an easterly\ndirection 1 this Agni (fire-altar) is built; and, moreover, in one moving\nforward, both the belly and the womb are moving forward. Outside the\nStomabhagas (he places them), for the Stomabhagas are the heart, and the heart\nis highest, then (comes) the belly, then the womb.\n\n8:6:2:1616\\. He places them south of the naturally-perforated (brick). Now, in\nthe first layer, he places\n\np. 116\n\nboth the belly and the womb north of the naturally-perforated one 1; for that\nnaturally-perforated one, indeed, is what this vital air in the middle (of the\nbody) is: he thus places the belly and the womb on both sides of that\n(central) vital air, and hence the belly and the womb are on both sides of\nthat central vital air.\n\n8:6:2:1717\\. The Dvipadas are the feet (the stand);--and as to its being\nDvipadas (verses of two feet), it is because the feet are a pair. There are\nthree (such verses), for a stand 2 (tripod) is threefold. He lays them down at\nthe back, for the feet are at the back (of the body).\n\n8:6:2:1818\\. That body of his (Agni) is well-made;--and, indeed, for\nwhomsoever they thus make that body of his so as to be well-made, he becomes\npossessed of that body of his as a well-made one; but for whomsoever they make\nit otherwise than that, for him they make that body of his so as to be ill-\nmade, and he becomes possessed of an ill-made body.\n\n8:6:2:1919\\. It is with reference to this that these two sama-nidhanas\n(finales of saman-hymns) are uttered,--'The light (is) in the highest heaven\nof the gods,' and, 'The gods (are) in the highest heaven of the\n\np. 117\n\nlight;'--for when on that occasion the gods were entering (heaven), Pra _g_\napati was the last to enter: that is why he says, 'The light (is) in the\nhighest heaven of the gods.' And as to why he says, 'The gods (are) in the\nhighest heaven of light,'--the light, doubtless, is this Agni (the fire-\naltar), and it is on his highest layer that all the gods have thus entered:\nthis is why he says, 'The gods are in the highest heaven of light.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[109:2](sbe4324.htm#fr_200) The _Kh_ andasyas represent the principal metres,\nthe formulas used in laying down the bricks being composed in the respective\nmetres. They consist of ten sets of three bricks each, representing the ten\nmetres, and an additional (thirty-first) brick representing the Ati _kh_\nandas, or redundant metre. Each of the ten sets consists of a central brick of\nfull size (a foot square) placed on one of the two spines, and flanked on the\ntwo sides not in contact with the spines by two half-size bricks, viz.:--1.\ngayatri at the east end of the 'spine'; 2. trish _t_ ubh on the Reta _h_ si\n_k_ range (joining the p. 110 Garhapatya on the front, or east, side); 3. _g_\nagati, on the Reta _h_ si _k_ range (joining the Garhapatya on the west side);\n4. anush _t_ ubh, immediately behind (west) of the preceding set; 5. b _ri_\nhati, immediately in front (east) of the Asha _dh_ a range (on which the ring\nof Stomabhagas lies); 6. ush _n_ ih, immediately behind (west of) the\nGayatris; 7. kakubh, immediately in front of the b _ri_ hati bricks; 8.\npa\xe1\xb9\x85kti, at the right (south) end of the 'cross-spine'; 9. padapa\xe1\xb9\x85kti, at the\nleft (north) end of the 'cross-spine'; 10. the single ati _kh_ andas,\nimmediately in front (east) of the fifth Asapatna (see [p.\n84](sbe4319.htm#page_84), note [1](sbe4319.htm#fn_169)); 11. (three) dvipada\nat the back, or west, end of the 'spine.'\n\n[110:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_201) That is, a position of honour, or dignity ( _s_\nri).\n\n[110:2](sbe4324.htm#fr_202) By the metres, here and in the sequel, we have to\nunderstand bricks laid down with verses of the respective metres (Va _g_. S.\nXV, 20 seq.).\n\n[110:3](sbe4324.htm#fr_203) That is, the so-called Great Litany (mahad uktham)\nrecited, by the Hot _ri_ , in response to the Mahavrata-saman, or Chant of the\nGreat Rite, at the midday service of the last but one day--the so-called\nMahavrata day--of the sacrificial session called 'Gavam ayanam,' or 'cows'\nwalk.' The Great Litany consists of numerous p. 111 hymns, and some detached\nverses and prose formulas; the whole matter recited being stated to amount to\nas many syllables as would make up a thousand B _ri_ hati verses (of thirty-\nsix syllables each)--or 36,000 syllables in all. From an analysis I have made\nof the Mahad uktham (or B _ri_ had uktham, as it is also called) as contained\nin MS. Ind. Off. 1729 D, I find it very difficult to check the accuracy of\nthis statement; my own calculation yielding somewhere about 37,200 syllables.\nBy leaving out of account the prose formulas, as well as certain repetitions,\nthis gross amount might, however, be reduced to something approximating the\nstated number of syllables; and, indeed, the calculation was probably not\nmeant to be a strictly accurate one. Cf. II, 3, 3, 19, 20 (where read Litany,\ninstead of Chant), part ii, p. 430. See also [IX, I, 1,\n44](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:44); [3, 3, 19](sbe4337.htm#9:3:3:19); [5, 2,\n12](sbe4344.htm#9:5:2:12).\n\n[111:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_204) The three Kakubh verses (Va _g_. S. XV, 38-40)\nconsist each of three padas, of eight, twelve, and eight syllables\nrespectively, making together twenty-eight syllables. In muttering these\nverses, whilst laying down the Kakubh bricks, he is to omit four syllables\nfrom the middle pada of each verse (so as to make it equal to the other two\npadas), and mutter the words thus omitted at the beginning of the verse (XV,\n47) used in laying down the Ati _kh_ andas brick. The syllables omitted make\nup complete words in each case, viz. 'bhadra rati _h_ ' at the beginning of\nthe middle pada of the first verse, 'v _ri_ traturye' at the end of the middle\npada of the second verse, and 'ava sthira' at the beginning of the second pada\nof the third verse. The remaining portions of the Kakubh verses consist each\nof twenty-four syllables, or a Gayatri verse. The references here made to the\ndifferent parts of the Mahad uktham are not quite clear, and seem to point to\na somewhat different arrangement of that _s_ astra from that known from the\nAitareyara _n_ yaka and the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-sutra. The head, indeed, consists of\nGayatri verses, viz. _Ri_ g-veda I, 7., either the whole, or, according to\nsome, only certain verses of it; the first three, or nine, verses also forming\nthe opening triplet, or triplets, of the Mahavrata-saman, the chanting of\nwhich precedes the recitation of the Great Litany.--For the trunk (atman)\nconsisting of trish _t_ ubh verses, see p. 113, note 1. The Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti verses, on\nthe other hand, said to form the wings, would seem to be _Ri_ g-veda VIII, 40\n(consisting of mahapa\xe1\xb9\x85ktis), p. 112 which in the Aitareya arrangement forms\nthe thighs, whilst Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khayana makes it part of the tail; and the _G_ agatis\nhere referred to as constituting the spine would seem to be X, 50, which\nimmediately follows the hymn just referred to, and is not otherwise identified\nwith any special part of the body. The MSS. of Harisvamin's commentary are\nunfortunately hopelessly corrupt in this place.\n\n[112:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_205) The Great Litany begins with seven sets of hymns\nand verses, meant symbolically to represent certain parts of Agni-Pra _g_\napati's bird-shaped body which the ceremony is intended to reconstruct, viz.\nthe trunk, neck, head, the roots (sinews) of the wings, the right and left\nwings, and the tail, between each two of which the so-called Sudadohas verse (\n_Ri_ g-veda VIII, 69, 3), meant to represent the vital air pervading the body,\nis inserted, as it also is between (and before) the succeeding parts. In the\nfirst place there follow three eighties of triplets (or, 3 sets of 240 verses\neach) in the Gayatri, B _ri_ hati and Ush _n_ ih metres respectively. Then\ncomes the Va _s_ a hymn representing the belly, and finally a course of\nrecitations (beginning with hymn VIII, 40) forming the thighs. For the part\nwhich the number eighty plays in the Agni _k_ ayana ceremony, see Weber, Ind.\nStud. XIII, p. 167. The term for 'eighty,' viz. 'a _s_ iti,' gives rise to a\nconstant etymological play. Saya _n_ a, on Aitareyara _n_ yaka I, 4, 3, 1,\ntakes it in the sense of 'food' (cf. above, [VIII, 5, 2,\n17](sbe4320.htm#8:5:2:17)); whilst the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka itself takes it in that of\n'obtainment':--yad evasmin loke ya _s_ o, yan maho, yan mithuna _m_ , yad\nannadya _m_ , ya 'pa _k_ itis tad a _s_ navai, tad apnavani, tad avaru _n_\nadhai, tan me 'sad iti.\n\n[112:2](sbe4324.htm#fr_206) This is the hymn _Ri_ g-veda VIII, 46, ascribed to\nVa _s_ a A _s_ vya, and remarkable for the variety of metres in which the\ndifferent verses are composed. In the Aitareya recension of the Mahad uktham\n(which is followed in the MS. of this _s_ astra referred to in the preceding\nnotes) only the first twenty verses are recited, but verse 15 being divided\ninto two verses, a dvipada and an ekapada, they are thus made to consist of\ntwenty-one verses.\n\n[113:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_207) The Nada-verse, _Ri_ g-veda VIII, 69, 2 (in the\nush _n_ ih metre) deriving its name from its first word 'nadam,' plays a\npeculiar part in the recitation of the Great Litany. The opening set of\nrecitations, representing the trunk, consists of twenty-two trish _t_ ubh\nverses; these are recited in such a way that after each pada (or quarter of a\nverse) one of the four padas of the Nada-verse is inserted. The chief object\nof this insertion seems to be a metrical one, viz. that of making each two\npadas (trish _t_ ubh = eleven, and ush _n_ ih = seven syllables) to form half\na b _ri_ hati verse (eighteen syllables), the whole Litany being computed by b\n_ri_ hati verses. Moreover, of v. 3 of the first Trish _t_ ubh hymn of this\nset ( _Ri_ g-veda X, 120) only the first two padas are recited at this stage\n(whilst the remaining two are recited in different places later on), and this\nhalf-verse is followed by a b _ri_ hati and a satob _ri_ hati pada (VII, 32,\n23 c, and VI, 46, 2 c), after which the recitation proceeds with verse 4 of\nthe first hymn. This seems to account for one of the two half-verses here\nreferred to, whilst the other would seem to be VII, 20, 1 a, b, recited later\non in the _s_ astra. Cf. Prof. F. Max Muller's translation of Aitareyar.,\nSacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 181 seqq.--The Aindragna hymn is VIII,\n40, 1-9; 11; 12, being the first hymn of the portion representing the thighs.\nIt consists of ten mahapa\xe1\xb9\x85kti verses (6 \xc3\x97 8 syllables)--each of which is split\nup into two Gayatri verses (3 \xc3\x97 8 syllables)--and one trish _t_ ubh verse.--\nThe chief anush _t_ ubh verses are those of _Ri_ g-veda I, 11, 1-8, which are\nrecited in a peculiar way (towards the end of the _s_ astra), the last pada of\neach verse interchanging with the first pada of the next verse.\n\n[114:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_208) Either because the Gayatri is the foremost and\nnoblest of metres (whence its symbolical connection with the priestly office\nand caste), and the one used for the first stoma at the Soma-sacrifice; or on\naccount of its being best adapted for singing. For the threefold nature of the\nhead, as consisting of skin, bone, and brain, see XII, 2, 4, 9.\n\n[114:2](sbe4324.htm#fr_209) That is, on both sides of the chest; see XII, 2,\n4, 11, with note.\n\n[115:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_210) Or, as one tending (flying) eastwards.\n\n[116:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_211) According to VII, 5, I, 38, the fire-pan is\nsupposed to represent the belly, and the mortar the yoni; and these two were,\nin the first layer, placed north of the svayam-at _ri_ _n_ _n_ a, or\nnaturally-perforated brick, so as to leave the space of a full brick between\nthem and that central brick of the layer; cf. VII, 5, I, 13. In the sketch of\nthe central part of the first layer ([p. 17](sbe4305.htm#img_01700)), the two\nnorthernmost bricks, marked _p_ , represent the fire-pan and mortar.\n\n[116:2](sbe4324.htm#fr_212) That is, the feet and back part of the body, or\nthe tail, the latter, in a sitting bird forming, as it were, a third foot or\nsupport to the body.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 6, 3.
